https://openalex.org/W1571495789,"The aim of this study was to determine the permeability of endothelial monolayers for endothelin-1 and a possible directionality of the endothelin-1 secretion process. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells were cultured on acellular amniotic membranes, dividing the tissue culture wells into an apical (luminal) and a basolateral (abluminal) compartment. Whereas in the absence of endothelial monolayers 44.9 +/- 2.3 and 43.5 +/- 2.0% of the unilaterally added endothelin-1 permeated from the apical to the basolateral side and from the basolateral to the apical side, respectively, only 6.5 +/- 0.6 and 6.6 +/- 0.4% diffused in the presence of endothelial cells. Analyzing endothelin-1 secretion, approximately 80% of the total amount of synthesized endothelin-1 was found in the basolateral compartment; thrombin (10 units/ml) stimulated the production of endothelin-1 approximately 2-fold, but did not change the relative distribution of endothelin-1 between the apical and basolateral compartments. In the presence of dexamethasone (10(-7) M), a decrease in the level of endothelin-1 was found in the apical compartment, whereas the total amount of endothelin-1 produced was not affected. Dexamethasone did not influence the permeability of human umbilical vein endothelial cell monolayers for endothelin-1. These results strongly support the hypothesis that endothelin-1 is a local paracrine regulator of vasotone."

We examined GPIIb-IIIa alone and bound to these ligands by electron microscopy after rotary shadowing with platinum/tungsten. We found, as observed previously, that in the presence of detergent and 2 mM Ca2+, GPIIb-IIIa consists of an 8 x 12-nm globular head with two 18-nm flexible tails extending from one side. We also found that in the presence of EDTA, GPIIb-IIIa dissociates into two similar comma-shaped subunits, each containing a portion of the globular head and a single tail. Using monoclonal antibodies to GPIIb, GPIIIa, and the GPIIb-IIIa heterodimer, we found that the tails contained the carboxyl termini of each subunit, while the nodular head was composed of amino-terminal segments of both subunits. Electron microscopy of GPIIb-IIIa bound to fibrinogen revealed a highly specific interaction of the nodular head of GPIIb-IIIa with the distal end of the trinodular fibrinogen molecule and with the tails of GPIIb-IIIa extended laterally at an angle of approximately 98 degrees with respect to the long axis of fibrinogen. When a GPIIb-IIIa was bound to each end of a single fibrinogen, the tails were oriented to opposite sides of fibrinogen, enabling fibrinogen to bridge two adjacent platelets. Electron microscopy of GPIIb-IIIa bound to fibronectin revealed GPIIb/IIIa-binding sites approximately two-thirds of the distance from the amino terminus of each end of the fibronectin molecule, while GPIIb-IIIa was found to bind to von Willebrand factor protomers along a rod-like region near the central nodule of the molecule."
https://openalex.org/W1525976258,"After immunostimulation, murine macrophages oxidize L-arginine into nitric oxide (NO) which acts as an effector molecule. In this study, we attempted to establish whether activated macrophage-derived NO forms paramagnetic complexes in tumor target cells which do not express by themselves the L-arginine:NO pathway. Accordingly, murine L1210 leukemia cells were cocultivated with activated peritoneal macrophages from Bacillus-Calmette-Guerin-infected mice, or activated in vitro with interferon-gamma. In control experiments, macrophages were prevented from producing nitrogen oxides by incubation with NG-monomethyl-L-arginine, a specific inhibitor of the L-arginine:NO pathway. After coculture, L1210 cells were removed from adherent macrophage monolayers and analyzed by electron paramagnetic resonance at 77 K. In the L1210 cells cultured with activated macrophages, we detected a signal typical of nitrosyl-iron-sulfur complexes, with g values of 2.041 and 2.015. This signal was not present when L1210 cells were either cultured alone or cocultured with activated macrophages in the presence of NG-monomethyl-L-arginine. Mitochondria from activated macrophage-injured L1210 cells also exhibited the signal with g values of 2.041 and 2.015. These results show that when tumor target cells undergo cell-to-cell contact with activated macrophages during culture, the macrophages promote target cell nitrosylation in compartments like mitochondria."
https://openalex.org/W2123151772,"The interaction of high density lipoproteins (HDL) with the HDL receptor stimulates the translocation of cholesterol from intracellular pools to the plasma membrane where the cholesterol becomes available for removal by appropriate acceptors. The role of signal transduction through protein kinase C in HDL receptor-dependent cholesterol translocation and efflux was examined using cholesterol-loaded cultured human skin fibroblasts. Treatment of cells with HDL3 activated protein kinase C, demonstrated by a transient increase in membrane associated kinase activity. Kinase activation appeared to be dependent on binding of HDL3 to the HDL receptor, since tetranitromethane-modified HDL3, which does not bind to the receptor, was without effect. Translocation of intracellular sterol to the plasma membrane was stimulated by treatment of cells with the protein kinase C activators, dioctanoylglycerol and phorbol myristic acetate, and the calcium ionophore A23187. Conversely, treatment of cells with sphingosine, a protein kinase C inhibitor, reduced HDL3-mediated translocation and efflux of intracellular sterols. However, sphingosine had no effect on efflux of labeled cholesterol derived from the plasma membrane. Down-regulation of cellular protein kinase C activity by long term incubation with phorbol esters also inhibited HDL3-mediated efflux of intracellular sterols and abolished the ability of sphingosine to further inhibit HDL3-mediated efflux. These studies support the conclusion that HDL receptor-mediated translocation and efflux of intracellular cholesterol occurs through activation of protein kinase C."
https://openalex.org/W1535657344,"We have determined that there are components to the time course of Ca(2+)-dependent secretion from digitonin-permeabilized bovine adrenal chromaffin cells that can be distinguished by Ca2+ sensitivity and ATP dependence. The effects of various Ca2+ concentrations are different on the initial rates and later rates of secretion. The earliest rates (5 s) are half-maximal between 30-100 microM Ca2+ and maximal by 300 microM Ca2+. Later rates of secretion are maximal by 10 microM and decline above 30 microM Ca2+. At low Ca2+ concentrations secretion begins after a lag of several seconds. The early rates of secretion (within 1 min) are dependent on the prior effects of MgATP. MgATP primes the cells to secrete. Later rates require the continuous presence of MgATP for optimal secretion. Incubation with low concentrations of Ca2+ increases the ability of MgATP to stimulate subsequent Ca(2+)-dependent secretion. Preincubation with Ca2+ has no effect on the rapid loss of ATP-independent secretion with time after permeabilization. The data indicate that: 1) as secretion progresses in digitonin-permeabilized cells, different events become rate-limiting; 2) maximal secretion at the early times requires at least 10-fold higher Ca2+ concentrations than at later times; 3) the rate at which Ca2+ initiates secretion is concentration-dependent; and 4) Ca2+ not only triggers the final events in secretion but enhances the ability of ATP to prime secretion."
https://openalex.org/W1544092207,"Human T cell leukemia virus type 1 is the causative agent of adult T cell leukemia. The virus encodes a 40-kDa protein, tax, that is important for the immortalization of T cells. Expression of tax activates several cellular transcription factors, including NF kappa B. We have previously identified two functional NF kappa B binding sites within the murine c-myc gene: upstream regulatory element (URE) and internal regulatory element (IRE). Using transient cotransfection analysis of Jurkat or HeLa cells, we report that tax can transactivate chimeric TK-CAT constructs containing multiple copies of wild-type URE or IRE, but not constructs with mutated versions of these elements. Furthermore, tax induced transcriptional activity of murine and human c-myc promoter-CAT hybrid genes in Jurkat and HeLa cells. A mutated tax expression vector, which fails to activate NF kappa B, was unable to induce either murine or human c-myc-CAT or URE/IRE-TK-CAT constructs. Mutant c-myc gene-CAT constructs, in which the URE and IRE were mutated either singly or in combination by site directed mutagenesis, displayed significantly reduced CAT activation upon cotransfection with a tax expression vector. These results suggest that tax can transactivate the c-myc gene through NF kappa B. The tax-induced stimulation of this oncogene may play a role in T cell immortalization."
https://openalex.org/W1578941035,"Heart mitochondria respiring in a sucrose medium containing P(i) show a permeability transition when challenged with Ca2+ and an oxidant such as cumene hydroperoxide. The transition results from the opening of a Ca(2+)-dependent pore and is evidenced by loss of membrane potential (delta psi) and osmotic swelling due to uptake of sucrose and other solutes. In the absence of oxidant, high concentrations of Ca2+ (100-150 microM) are necessary to induce loss of delta psi and initiate swelling. Cyclosporin A delays the loss of delta psi but enhances swelling under these conditions, apparently by promoting better retention of accumulated Ca2+. Cyclosporin A and ADP together restore delta psi in respiring mitochondria that have undergone the permeability transition at levels that are not effective when either is added alone. When the state of the Ca(2+)-dependent pore is assessed using passive osmotic contraction in response to polyethylene glycol (Haworth, R. A., and Hunter, D. R. (1979) Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 195, 460-467), cyclosporin A is found to be a partial inhibitor of solute flow through the open pore. Cyclosporin A decreases the Vmax of passive contraction and increases the Km for Ca2+ without affecting the Hill slope. ADP in the presence of carboxyatractyloside closes the pore almost completely even in the presence of 40 microM Ca2+. ADP shows mixed type inhibition of the Ca(2+)-dependent pore, and cyclosporin A increases the affinity of the pore for ADP. It is concluded that cyclosporin A and ADP act synergistically to close the Ca(2+)-dependent pore of the mitochondrion and that the pore is probably not formed directly from the adenine nucleotide transporter."
https://openalex.org/W1495660248,"Full-length cDNA clones for the CBF-A and CBF-B subunits of the CCAAT binding mammalian heteromeric transcription factor (CBF) have previously been isolated from both rat and mouse. Whereas recombinant CBF-B binds to DNA after complementation with a highly purified CBF-A fraction, recombinant CBF-A was unable to bind to DNA after complementation with either purified CBF-B or recombinant CBF-B. However, when recombinant CBF-A, synthesized as a fusion protein with glutathione S-transferase was denatured together with a highly purified fraction containing CBF-A in the presence of 5.5 M guanidine hydrochloride and subsequently renatured, the recombinant CBF-A bound to DNA after complementation with CBF-B. This binding of recombinant CBF-A could not be detected if recombinant CBF-A was not mixed during the denaturation-renaturation process together with the purified fraction containing the 32-kDa CBF-A. Using a Southwestern blot we demonstrated that a polypeptide of approximately 40 kDa, present in the purified CBF-A fraction, bound to DNA after complementation with both recombinant CBF-A and CBF-B. After fractionation of the purified CBF-A preparation by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, a species of approximately 40 kDa was eluted from the gel and shown to have DNA binding activity after complementation with both recombinant CBF-A and CBF-B. Our results indicate that a third polypeptide, designated CBF-C, forms a tight complex with CBF-A. Together with CBF-A and CBF-B, CBF-C is required for the DNA binding activity of CBF."
https://openalex.org/W1514059110,"Mammary epithelial cells, under the regulation of the lactogenic hormones, produce high amounts of milk proteins during the lactation period. The caseins are the most abundant milk proteins. We have studied the regulation of beta-casein gene expression and found that the lactogenic hormones induce transcription of the beta-casein gene promoter. The hormonal regulation is mediated in part by a mammary gland-specific transcription factor (MGF). MGF is a specific DNA-binding protein which recognizes the sequence 5‘-ACTTCT-TGGAATT-3‘. This sequence is conserved with slight variations in the alpha- and beta-casein gene promoters of the cow and rodents at position -87 to -99. Bovine MGF and rodent MGF behaved identically when their DNA binding properties and migration in polyacrylamide gels as protein-DNA complexes were compared. MGF was purified to near homogeneity from nuclear extracts of mammary epithelial cells derived from lactating rats. The combination of Bio-Rex 70-, DNA-Sepharose-, and sequence-specific DNA affinity column chromatography yielded a highly purified preparation of MGF. The purification from nuclear extract was more than 2400-fold, and the yield of MGF activity was 11%. A protein of 89 kDa was visualized by silver staining after sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The apparent molecular weight was confirmed by UV cross-linking of the factor to its cognate DNA binding sequence and subsequent gel electrophoresis. Excision of the 89-kDa band from the gel and renaturation of the protein restored its specific DNA binding ability. This indicates that MGF is composed of a single polypeptide."
https://openalex.org/W1524712279,"Abstract We have mutagenized the human apoA-I gene and have generated cell lines which express normal and mutant apoA-I forms. Point mutations were introduced which changed Gln-1, Gln-2 to Arg,Arg, Pro99 to His, and Pro121 to His. In addition, the following amino acid deletions (delta) were generated: delta 113-124, delta 148-186, delta 212-233, and delta 213-243. The apoA-I form isolated from the culture medium of C127 cells was analyzed for its ability to activate lecithin-cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT) and to bind to phospholipid vesicles and high density lipoprotein (HDL). Compared with the wild type (WT) apoA-I, the relative activation of LCAT achieved by the point mutations Gln-1, Gln-2----Arg,Arg, Pro99----His, and Pro121----His were 106 +/- 7, 92 +/- 6, and 77 +/- 9%, respectively. Kinetic analysis of one mutant apoA-I form showed similar Vmax but a 15-fold increase in the Km of the mutant apoA-I form. Furthermore, the activation achieved by the internal deletion mutants delta 113-124, delta 148-186, delta 212-233, and delta 213-243 was 47 +/- 3, 0.5 +/- 0.4, 28 +/- 4 and 13 +/- 5%, respectively. Mutants deficient in their ability to activate LCAT displayed alterations in liposome and HDL binding, compared with WT as determined by density gradient ultracentrifugation analysis of the culture medium. Thus, the peak recovery (approximately 50%) of apoA-I bound to HDL was at density 1.14 g/ml for the WT apoA-I, at 1.18 g/ml for the mutants delta 113-124 and delta 148-186, and at d greater than 1.21 g/ml for the delta 212-233 and delta 213-243. Electron microscopy of the proteoliposome LCAT substrate generated by WT and mutant apoA-I forms showed that the carboxyl-terminal deletion mutants which displayed aberrant binding to HDL also displayed reduced ability to convert the spherical lecithin-cholesterol vesicles into discs compared with WT. The findings suggest that (a) the importance of the carboxyl terminus of apoA-I for LCAT activation is related to its ability to bind to lipid and/or to form discoidal substrate for LCAT, and (b) the interaction of several domains of apoA-I are required for the activation of LCAT."
https://openalex.org/W1577844473,"pp54 microtubule-associated protein-2 (MAP-2) kinase, a recently discovered protein serine/threonine kinase (Kyriakis, J., and Avruch, J. (1990) J. Biol. Chem. 265, 17355-17363), is shown to contain immunoreactive phosphotyrosine residues. Treatment with recombinant rat brain protein tyrosine phosphatase-1 deactivates pp54 MAP-2 kinase, concomitant with the removal of phosphotyrosine residues. Protein (serine/threonine) phosphatase-1 also deactivates pp54 MAP-2 kinase in a specific fashion. pp54 MAP-2 kinase joins pp42 MAP-2 kinase and cdc2/maturation-promoting factor as one of only three serine/threonine protein kinases known to be regulated by phosphorylation at both tyrosine and, independently, at serine/threonine residues. In view of these shared regulatory properties, a role for pp54 MAP-2 kinase in the control of cell division is likely."
https://openalex.org/W1504054464,"The binding of tropomyosin to actin and troponin-tropomyosin to actin was analyzed according to a linear lattice model which quantifies two parameters: Ko, the affinity of the ligand for an isolated site on the actin filament, and gamma, the fold increase in affinity when binding is contiguous to an occupied site (cooperativity). Tropomyosin-actin binding is very cooperative (gamma = 90-137). Troponin strengthens tropomyosin-actin binding greatly but, surprisingly, does so solely by an 80-130-fold increase in Ko, while cooperativity actually decreases. Additionally, troponin complexes containing TnT subunits with deletions of either amino acids 1-69 (troponin70-259) or 1-158 (troponin159-259) were examined. Deletion of amino acids 1-69 had only small effects on Ko and y, despite this peptide's location spanning the joint between adjacent tropomyosins. Ca2+ reduced Ko by half for both troponin and troponin70-159 and had no detectable effect on cooperativity. Troponin159-259 had much weaker effects on tropomyosin-actin binding than did troponin70-259 and had no effect at all in the presence of Ca2+. This suggests the importance of Ca(2+)-insensitive interactions between tropomyosin and troponin T residues 70-159. Cooperativity was slightly lower for troponin159-259 than tropomyosin alone, suggesting that the globular head region of troponin affects tropomyosin-tropomyosin interactions along the thin filament."
https://openalex.org/W1531198323,"RecA protein promotes a substantial DNA strand exchange reaction in the presence of adenosine 5'-O-3-(thio)triphosphate (ATP gamma S) (Menetski, J.P., Bear, D.G., and Kowalczykowski, S.C. (1990) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 87, 21-25), calling into question the role of ATP hydrolysis in the strand exchange reaction. Here, we demonstrate that the ATP gamma S-mediated reaction can go to completion when the duplex DNA substrate is only 1.3 kilobase pairs in length. The ATP gamma S-mediated reaction, however, is completely blocked by a 52-base pair heterologous insertion in either DNA substrate. This same barrier is readily bypassed when ATP replaces ATP gamma S. This indicates that at least one function of recA-mediated ATP hydrolysis is to bypass structural barriers in one or both DNA substrates during strand exchange. This suggests that ATP hydrolysis is directly coupled to the branch migration phase of strand exchange, not to promote strand exchange between homologous DNA substrates during recombination, but instead to facilitate the bypass of structural barriers likely to be encountered during recombinational DNA repair."
https://openalex.org/W1585621897,"In search of hitherto undiscovered coat proteins, clathrin-associated proteins (APs) from coated vesicles of bovine brain were affinity-purified by one cycle of coat assembly and fractionated by gel filtration on Superose 6. Immunochemical and gel electrophoretic analysis of the fractions revealed, besides AP180, auxilin, HA1, and HA2, a component with M(r) approximately 140,000. This protein (p140) is present in coated vesicles in about equimolar proportion to auxilin. The contribution of HA1, HA2, AP180, and auxilin to the total assembly activity in the Tris-soluble coat protein fraction were quantitatively analyzed by measuring the reduction in activity when each protein was removed from the mixture by immunoaffinity chromatography. It was found that AP180 accounts for 61% and HA2 for 33% of the activity, whereas auxilin, HA1, and p140 made a negligible contribution. Based on the relative molar concentration of APs in the coat protein fraction, AP180 is about 4 times more active in promoting clathrin assembly than are HA2 or the other APs."
https://openalex.org/W1496130738,"In addition to the conserved AAUAAA hexanucleotide, GU- and U-rich sequences in the 3'-flanking region are thought to be critical for efficient polyadenylation. The 3'-flanking sequence requirements for efficient and accurate polyadenylation of the bovine growth hormone (bGH) gene were determined by quantitative S1 nuclease analysis of transcripts derived from various bGH 3' deletions and block mutations transiently transfected into COS-1 cells. Though the bGH 3'-flanking sequence contains a portion of the putative GU efficiency element, we find that mutation of this element leads to a marginal decrease in efficiency similar to that from mutation of other sequences that do not contain recognizable GU- or U-rich motifs. The data are consistent with a diffuse efficiency element in the bGH polyadenylation signal rather than a discrete element as is thought to exist in other mammalian signals. We have also determined that a region from 18 to 27 nucleotides downstream of the cleavage site contains sequences required for correctly positioning the cleavage site."
https://openalex.org/W1502578435,"Within the 5'-untranslated region of ferritin mRNAs, there is a conserved region of 28 nucleotides (nt) (the iron regulatory element (IRE)) that binds a protein (the IRE-binding protein (IRE-BP)) involved in the iron regulation of ferritin mRNA translation. We have examined the role of RNA secondary structure on the interaction of the IRE with the IRE-BP. First, the rat light ferritin IRE possesses a structure similar to that of the bullfrog heavy ferritin IRE (Wang, Y.-H., Sczekan, S. R., and Theil, E. C. (1990) Nucleic Acids Res. 18, 4463-4468). This includes an extended stem, interrupted at various points by bulge nucleotides and a 6-nt single-stranded loop (CAGUGU) at its top. Computer predictions and mapping results suggest the presence of a 3-nt (UGC) bulge 5 bases 5' of the loop in the rat IRE. Second, disruption of the base pairing in the upper stem alters IRE secondary structure and reduces the affinity with which the IRE-BP binds the IRE. Third, increasing the size of the loop or the distance between the UGC bulge and the loop reduces the IRE/IRE-BP interaction. Our results indicate that several aspects of IRE secondary structure are important for its high affinity binding to the IRE-BP."
https://openalex.org/W1503676980,"Abstract Mutants of the cyanobacterium Synechococcus sp. PCC 7002 constructed by the insertional inactivation of either the cpcE or cpcF gene produce low levels of spectroscopically detectable phycocyanin. The majority of the phycocyanin produced in these strains appears to lack the alpha subunit phycocyanobilin (PCB) chromophore (Zhou, J., Gasparich, G. E., Stirewalt, V. L., de Lorimier, R., and Bryant, D. A. (1992) J. Biol. Chem. 267, 16138-16145). Purification of the phycocyanin produced in the mutants revealed two fractions each with an aberrant absorption spectrum. Tryptic peptide maps of the major fraction showed that the alpha-84 PCB peptide was absent. The two PCB peptides derived from the beta subunit were normal. Tryptic digests of the less abundant phycocyanin fraction contained a family of bilin peptides derived from the alpha subunit. Several distinct bilin adducts were present. A major component was a mesobiliverdin adduct, a previously described product of the in vitro reaction of PCB and apophycocyanin. The same results were obtained with both the cpcE mutant and the cpcF mutant. In vitro reactions with PCB and the fractions containing apo alpha subunit showed that the alpha-84 bilin attachment site was unmodified and competent for adduct formation. Pseudo-revertants of both strains were observed to arise at high frequency. Analysis of the phycocyanin from a cpcE pseudo-revertant, which produced a near wild-type level of phycocyanin with alpha subunit carrying PCB, revealed a single amino acid substitution, alpha-Tyr129----Cys. This residue, which is conserved in all phycocyanins sequenced to date, forms part of the alpha-84 bilin binding site and lies within 5 A of alpha-Cys84. A mutated cpcA gene containing this substitution was constructed by site-directed mutagenesis and transformed, along with cpcB, into a cpcBAC deletion strain containing an insertionally inactivated cpcE. This strain produces high levels of phycocyanin and the majority of the alpha subunit carries PCB at alpha-Cys84."
https://openalex.org/W1540228280,"Hemopexin-mediated heme transport into mouse hepatoma (Hepa) cells and human promyelocytic (HL-60) cells stimulates the expression of heme oxygenase via transcriptional activation (Alam, J., and Smith, A. (1989) J. Biol. Chem. 264, 17637-17640). Incubation of both these cell types in serum-free medium containing heme-hemopexin is shown here also to increase the steady-state level of metallothionein (MT) mRNA in a time- and dose-dependent manner. Heme-hemopexin is a far more effective inducer (12-fold) of the MT isozyme 1 (MT-1) in Hepa cells than nonprotein-bound heme (4-fold). Apohemopexin has no effect on MT-1 expression, and incubation with heme-hemopexin of mouse L fibroblasts that lack hemopexin receptors does not affect MT-1 expression. Thus, an interaction between the heme-hemopexin complex and its receptor is necessary for increased accumulation of MT-1 transcripts. In vitro nuclear run-on analysis indicates that the heme-hemopexin-mediated accumulation of MT-1 mRNA is regulated primarily at the level of initiation of transcription. A highly labile protein is required for constitutive MT-1 gene expression and acts to repress transcription. Transcriptional activation by heme or metals may require decreased concentrations or inactivation of the repressor as well as an additional inducer-specific trans-acting factor. Inhibition of protein synthesis augments the heme-hemopexin-mediated accumulation of MT-1 mRNA. Activation of heme oxygenase (HO) gene transcription by heme requires the synthesis of one (or more) heme-inducible proteins that are labile or become labile upon cycloheximide-sensitive processing or activation. Our comparison of MT and HO points to significant differences in the mechanisms of gene regulation by heme. The concomitant regulation of gene expression of MT-1 and HO in response to heme-hemopexin appears to be a concerted adaptive response of the cells, mediated at the level of the plasma membrane hemopexin receptor, and may relate to the proposed role of MT as an intracellular antioxidant or to a need to sequester zinc which otherwise would compete with iron and occupy sites on regulatory proteins such as the iron-responsive elements."
https://openalex.org/W1557388502,"Resonance Raman spectroscopy has been used to investigate the function and properties of the iron-sulfur cluster in Escherichia coli endonuclease III. Resonance Raman spectra in the Fe-S stretching region are indicative of a [4Fe-4S]2+ cluster with complete cysteinyl sulfur coordination, and vibrational assignments are made by analogy with bacterial ferredoxins. Minor changes in the vibrational frequencies of the modes primarily involving Fe-S(Cys) stretching accompany the binding of the inhibitor thymine glycol or an oligonucleotide containing a reduced apyrimidinic site. These changes are consistent with perturbation of the orientation of the ligating cysteinyl residues and rule out the possibility that the [4Fe-4S] cluster is directly involved with substrate or inhibitor binding. It is concluded that a structural role is most likely for the [4Fe-4S] cluster in endonuclease III."
https://openalex.org/W1570107132,"The p21ras superfamily, involved in diverse processes including cell growth and intracellular trafficking, possesses intrinsic GTPase activity and cycles between GTP-bound active and GDP-bound quiescent states. This intrinsic activity, which results in down-regulation, is accelerated by GTPase activating proteins (GAPs). Other proteins regulating the GDP/GTP cycle include exchange proteins and dissociation inhibitors. The p21s rho, rac, and cdc42Hs constitute a subfamily implicated in cytoskeletal organization. BCR and n-chimaerin are prototypes of a new GAP family for these p21s. To investigate proteins modulating GTP hydrolysis of the three p21s, we developed a novel overlay assay applicable to tissue extracts. Diverse GAPs with different specificities were identified in all rat tissues. Brain contained rac1 GAPs of 45, 50, 85, 100, and 150 kDa. The p50 and p150 GAPs also act on rhoA and cdc42Hs and are ubiquitous, while the p45-GAP, n-chimaerin, is brain- and testis-specific and acts preferentially on rac1; the p100 GAP acts on both rac1 and cdc42Hs and is brain-specific. A new class of p21-interacting proteins was also identified. This diversity, versatility, and tissue specificity of GAPs may be required for fine control of the down-regulation of GTP-bound p21s and the suggested specific downstream effects of individual GAPs, which could involve cross-talk between GAPs and p21s."
https://openalex.org/W1512249841,"Yeast NSR1 protein is structurally related to mammalian nucleolin and is involved in ribosome synthesis as described in the preceding paper (Kondo, K., and Inouye, M. (1992) J. Biol. Chem. 267, 16252-16258). We report here the regulation of NSR1 gene expression and the effect of nsr1 deletion on growth and pre-rRNA processing after cold shock. A basal level of the transcript was detected at 30 degrees C only in exponentially growing cells and increased approximately 3-fold after cold shock to 10 degrees C. NSR1 protein level also increased about 3-fold after the shock. The nsr1 deletion caused a severe growth defect at low temperatures as well as a long growth lag after temperature shift from 30 to 10 degrees C. Northern hybridization analysis demonstrated that cold shock led to a rapid decrease in the amounts of 27 S, 20 S, and 7 S rRNA precursors in the nsr1 strain, although at 30 degrees C a major defect was observed only in 20 S pre-rRNA synthesis. Pulse-chase labeling of rRNA showed that pre-rRNA processing in the nsr1 strain was greatly impaired after cold shock. These results demonstrate that the NSR1 protein is required for normal pre-rRNA processing and cell growth in yeast when cells are exposed to abrupt temperature drop."
https://openalex.org/W1571457734,"We have examined the temperature sensitivity of exocytosis in digitonin-permeabilized chromaffin cells. The time course of secretion is markedly slowed by incubating the cells at 18 degrees C rather than 27 degrees C. We have previously shown that secretion has both ATP-dependent and ATP-independent components (Holz, R. W., Bittner, M. A., Peppers, S. C., Senter, R. A., and Eberhard, D. A. (1989) J. Biol. Chem. 264, 5412-5419). Reducing the temperature has no effect on ATP-independent secretion. However, cold (18 degrees C) greatly slows the ability of ATP to stimulate secretion. The ATP-requiring priming step itself is not affected by reducing the temperature since an effect of ATP can be seen after permeabilization at 18 degrees C if the cells are subsequently stimulated to secrete at 27 degrees C. When cells are permeabilized at 27 degrees C with ATP and then stimulated by Ca2+ in the absence of ATP, the secretion which was primed by ATP during the permeabilization step is inhibited 75% at 18 degrees C. Similar results are seen when ATP-dependent priming is enhanced by low concentrations of Ca2+. Thus, the temperature-sensitive step occurs after ATP and Ca2+ act to prime the cell. The temperature-sensitive step is likely to be overall rate-limiting step during the later phase of secretion, when the ATP-dependent priming process is limiting."
https://openalex.org/W1592201456,"L-651,582, 5-amino-[4-(4-chlorobenzoyl)-3,5-dichlorobenzyl]-1,2,3-triazole-4- carboxamide, an antiproliferative and antiparasitic agent previously shown to affect 45Ca2+ uptake into mammalian cells, inhibits both receptor-mediated and voltage-dependent calcium entry in well characterized in vitro systems. Indo 1 fluorescence measurements of cytosolic calcium levels indicate that the drug has no effect on the initial transient release of internal stores of calcium stimulated by fMet-Leu-Phe in rat polymorphonuclear leukocytes. It does decrease the levels maintained subsequently, however, indicating blockage of calcium influx through receptor-operated channels. L-651,582 also blocks the stimulation of leukotriene B4 (LTB4) production by fMet-Leu-Phe with an IC50 = 0.5 micrograms/ml equal to that for calcium entry inhibition. The LTB4 inhibition is likely due to calcium entry inhibition since L-651,582 does not inhibit calmodulin or enzymes producing arachidonate metabolites. L-651,582 also inhibits potassium-stimulated 45Ca2+ influx into GH3 cells with an IC50 of 0.5 microgram/ml, indicating a block of voltage-gated L-type calcium channels. Patch voltage clamp measurements of current through L- and T-type calcium in guinea pig atrial cells also indicate that L-651,582 is a calcium antagonist. Block of L-type calcium channels is voltage-dependent, and the apparent dissociation constant for the high affinity state is 0.2 micrograms/ml. The IC50 for block of T-type calcium channels is 1.4 micrograms/ml. The inhibition of cellular proliferation and the production of arachidonate metabolites by L-651,582 may be the result of the nearly equipotent block of receptor-operated and voltage-gated calcium channels."
https://openalex.org/W1581884860,"We have shown previously that Golgi-enriched vesicles from the human melanoma cell line Melur can transfer [3H]acetate from [acetyl-3H]acetyl-CoA to endogenous GD3 to form [acetyl-3H]O-acetyl-GD3 (Manzi, A. E., Sjoberg, E. R., Diaz, S., and Varki, A. (1990) J. Biol. Chem. 265, 13091-13103). Applying the same approach in the human melanoma cell line M21, label was found in [acetyl-3H]O-acetyl-GD3 and also in a species co-migrating with unsubstituted GD3 on TLC. Both were sialidase-sensitive and alkali-labile, indicating incorporation as [3H]O-acetyl esters on sialic acids. Immunological reactivity, sialidase sensitivity, chromatographic behavior, and the known ganglioside pattern of M21 cells suggested that the slower migrating species might be [acetyl-3H]O-acetyl-GD2. Sialic acids released from this labeled molecule by sialidase showed esterification with [3H]acetate at both C7 and C9 hydroxyls. Lipid extracts from cells metabolically labeled with [3H]galactose showed a corresponding ganglioside, which upon alkali treatment yielded a species migrating with GD2. Analysis of purified ganglioside by high performance thin layer chromatography immuno-overlays, fast atom bombardment-mass spectrometry in positive and negative ion modes, periodate oxidation resistance, linkage analysis by permethylation and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, and 500 MHz 1H NMR was consistent with the following structure: 9-O Ac-Neu5Ac alpha 2-8Neu5Ac alpha 2-3(GalNAc beta 1-4) Gal beta 1-4Gluc beta 1-1' ceramide Total gangliosides from M21 were analyzed by high performance thin layer chromatography immuno-overlay with monoclonal antibodies D1.1, JONES, 27A, and 8A2, all known to, or suspected of reacting with 9-O-acetylated gangliosides. The first three bound well to 9-O-acetyl-GD3 and a slower migrating 9-O-acetylated ganglioside, which was distinct from 9-O-acetyl-GD2. Antibody 8A2 reacted weakly with purified 9-O-acetyl-GD2 and strongly with two other 9-O-acetylated gangliosides migrating slower than 9-O-acetyl-GD2. Thus, the family of O-acetylated gangliosides in melanoma cells is much more complex than previously appreciated."
https://openalex.org/W1606107755,"Properties of the reactions of cis-dichlorodiammine Pt(II) and related complexes with zinc metallothionein or apometallothionein have been investigated. During these reactions, platinum binds stoichiometrically to protein sulfhydryl groups and zinc, if present, is displaced. The ammine ligands are also lost in the process, suggesting that Pt(II) has tetrathiolate coordination in metallothionein. This conclusion is supported by extended x-ray absorption-fine structure studies which indicate that there are 4 sulfurs in the first coordination sphere of the platinum centers. The product contains 10 +/- 2 Pt(II) per mol of protein and migrates over Sephadex G-75 as a structure of similar size to zinc metallothionein. The kinetics of reaction are biphasic as monitored by the formation of Pt-thiolate bonds or by the release of zinc from the protein. Both methods yield identical rate laws for the reaction. The first step is independent of Pt(II) concentration but involves the binding of as many as four platinum atoms to the protein with little Pt-sulfhydryl bond formation and without much loss of zinc. The second rate process is first order in both zinc or sulfhydryl binding sites and Pt(II). Neither kinetic step is sensitive to the chloride ion concentration over the range 0-0.5 M. However, the reaction is sensitive to pH between 5.5 and 8.0. trans-Dichlorodiammineplatinum(II) reacts with zinc metallothionein with similar kinetics."
https://openalex.org/W1573374536,"RecA protein promotes a substantial DNA strand exchange reaction in the presence of adenosine 5'-O-3-(thio)triphosphate (ATP gamma S) (Menetski et al., 1990), calling into question the role of ATP hydrolysis in this reaction. We demonstrate here that the ATP gamma S-mediated process is restricted to homologous strand exchange reactions involving three strands. In four-strand exchanges between a gapped duplex circle and a second linear duplex, joint molecules are formed in the gap but are not extended into the four-strand region when ATP gamma S is present. This result provides evidence that one function of ATP hydrolysis in the recA system is to facilitate reciprocal DNA strand exchange involving four strands. Implications with respect to the role of four-stranded pairing intermediates and the mechanistic relationship between three- and four-strand exchange reactions are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1589707187,"Mice infected with an immunosuppressive murine leukemia virus (MuLV) mixture, LP-BM5, displayed profound and selective deficits in spatial learning in a modified Morris water maze. These deficits appeared before the appearance of gross neurological impairment or histopathological changes in the central nervous system. Thus, LP-BM5-infected mice displayed deficits in several aspects of trained performance compared to controls. Furthermore, a failure to exhibit any evidence of task acquisition in this maze was observed almost twice as frequently (P less than 0.0005) in infected mice as in uninfected controls. Moreover, in the absence of gross visual, motoric, or motivational impairment, LP-BM5 MuLV-infected animals exhibited neither the target directed search pattern nor the spatial preference characteristic of controls. The spatial learning and memory deficit described here is the first report of cognitive impairment accompanying viral-induced immunosuppression in a nonprimate species."
https://openalex.org/W1563608294,"We investigated the effects of the non-phorbol tumor promoter okadaic acid on human leukemia K562 cells. It was found that okadaic acid potently and reversibly inhibited cell growth, with a nearly complete inhibition of thymidine uptake seen at about 10 nM. The cytotoxicity of okadaic acid was characterized by a marked mitotic arrest of the cells exhibiting scattered chromosomes and abnormal anaphase-like structures, a phenomenon distinct from the typical metaphase arrest caused by colchicine. Okadaic acid (10-1,000 nM) greatly stimulated phosphorylation of a number of nuclear proteins in K562 cells. Phosphorylation of many of the same proteins was also stimulated by 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-O-acetate, a protein kinase C activator. The present findings, consistent with recent reports that okadaic acid is a potent inhibitor of protein phosphatases 1 and 2A (PP1 and PP2A) shown to be essential for normal mitosis, provided evidence for the first time that okadaic acid inhibition of PP1/PP2A resulted in enhanced nuclear protein phosphorylation and subsequent mitotic arrest."
https://openalex.org/W2128706310,"We have analyzed the metabolic pathway of maturation of APP751 in stably transfected 293 cells, in the presence of either of the cysteine protease inhibitors leupeptin or E-64. Metabolic labeling, followed by immunoprecipitation at various times in the chase with a rabbit polyclonal antibody (anti-BX6) specific to the carboxyl-terminal end of amyloid precursor protein (APP), revealed the accumulation of a novel approximately 22-kDa carboxyl-terminal fragment (22-CTF) in the inhibitor-treated cells. This fragment, which was not detectable in untreated cells, was immunoprecipitated by four separate antibodies to the carboxyl-terminal region of APP as well as by polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies specific to the first 16 amino acids of the beta-peptide domain. Antibodies to the amino-terminal end of APP do not, however, recognize the fragment. Co-treatment of the inhibitor-treated cells with either of the lysosomotropic agents chloroquine or ammonium chloride completely blocked the generation of this fragment but did not significantly affect APP maturation or secretion. All, however, slowed the intracellular turnover of the cell-associated, approximately 9-kDa carboxyl-terminal fragment (c-CTF) produced during constitutive secretion. Densitometric analyses of these results suggest that this non-secretory pathway of APP degradation, mediated by cysteine proteases in an intracellular acidic compartment, accounts for approximately 70% of total APP metabolism and that a key processing intermediate in this pathway is a 22-kDa, beta-peptide-containing APP carboxyl-terminal fragment. It is possible that inefficient degradation of such an intermediate leads to the formation of aggregating beta-peptide."
https://openalex.org/W13638220,"Previously it was reported (Bremer, E.G., Schlessinger, J., and Hakomori, S.-I. (1986) J. Biol. Chem. 261, 2434-2440) that ganglioside GM3 inhibited epidermal growth factor (EGF)-stimulated phosphorylation of the EGF receptor in Triton X-100-treated preparations of human epidermoid carcinoma (A431) cell membranes. In addition, these authors reported that GM3 inhibited the growth of A431 cells. In contrast, a modified ganglioside, de-N-acetyl GM3, enhanced the EGF-dependent tyrosine kinase activity of the EGF receptor. In this work and in subsequent studies (Hanai, N., Dohi, T., Nores, G. A., and Hakomori, S.-I. (1988) J. Biol. Chem. 263, 6296-6301), the tyrosine kinase activity of the receptor from A431 cell membranes was assayed in the presence of Triton X-100. In this report, we confirm that GM3 inhibited and de-N-acetyl GM3 stimulated EGF receptor autophosphorylation in the presence of Triton X-100. However, in the absence of detergents, ganglioside GM3 inhibited EGF-stimulated receptor autophosphorylation, whereas de-N-acetyl GM3 had no effect on EGF-stimulated receptor autophosphorylation. The effects of these gangliosides on receptor autophosphorylation were measured in both A431 cell plasma membranes and in 3T3 cell membranes permeabilized to [32P]ATP by a freeze-thaw procedure, in intact A431 cells permeabilized with alamethicin, and in intact A431 cells grown in the presence of [32P]orthophosphate. Thus, the inhibitory effect of GM3 on receptor autophosphorylation was demonstrated in the presence and in the absence of detergent; the stimulatory effect of de-N-acetyl GM3 was observed only in the presence of detergent. We also demonstrate that ganglioside GM3 inhibited EGF-stimulated growth of transfected murine fibroblasts (3T3) that express the gene for human EGF receptor (Velu, T. J., Beguinot, L., Vass, W. C., Zhang, K., Pastan, I., and Lowy, D. R. (1989) J. Cell. Biochem. 39, 153-166). De-N-acetyl ganglioside GM3 had no effect on the growth of these cells. Growth of control fibroblasts, which lack endogenous EGF receptors (Pruss, R. M., and Herschman, H. R. (1977) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 74, 3918-3921), was not affected by the presence of either ganglioside. Similarly, ganglioside GM3, but not de-N-acetyl ganglioside GM3, inhibited the EGF-dependent incorporation of [3H]thymidine into DNA by transfected fibroblasts. Incorporation of labeled thymidine into DNA of control fibroblasts was not affected by the presence of either ganglioside. These studies indicate that ganglioside GM3, but not its deacetylated analogue, can affect EGF receptor kinase activity in intact membranes.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"
https://openalex.org/W1489542806,"Triglycerides in circulating plasma lipoproteins are hydrolyzed by lipoprotein lipase (LPL) which is thought to bind to proteoglycans on the luminal endothelial cell surface. Previous studies from this laboratory using LPL-Sepharose affinity chromatography identified a 220-kDa LPL binding proteoglycan. Using ligand blotting with 125I-LPL, we now report a 116-kDa LPL binding protein in plasma membrane preparations of endothelial cells. 125I-LPL binding to this protein was abolished by addition of unlabeled LPL. When the cell surface of endothelial cells was labeled with biotin, a 116-kDa protein was biotinylated. Furthermore, the biotinylated 116-kDa protein bound to LPL-Sepharose and eluted with 0.4 M NaCl suggesting that the 116-kDa LPL binding protein is present on the cell surface. When detergent extracts of endothelial cells were applied to LPL-Sepharose in the presence of 0.15 M NaCl, the 116-kDa, but not the 220-kDa, protein still bound to LPL-Sepharose. The 116-kDa protein was not labeled with 35SO4 and eluted from DEAE-cellulose prior to proteoglycans, suggesting that it is not a proteoglycan. However, a 116-kDa endothelial cell surface protein was metabolically labeled with [35S]methionine. This protein was dissociated from the cell surface by incubating cells with heparin (50 units/ml)-containing buffer. After heparin treatment of endothelial cells, LPL binding to and internalization by the cells decreased greater than 70% compared to control cells. These results suggest that endothelial cells synthesize a heparin-releasable, high affinity 116-kDa LPL binding protein. We postulate that this protein is associated with proteoglycans on luminal endothelial surfaces and mediates LPL binding, internalization, and recycling. We name this protein hrp (heparin-releasable protein)-116."
https://openalex.org/W1581238457,"RNase PH is a Pi-dependent exoribonuclease that can act at the 3' terminus of tRNA precursors in vitro. To obtain information about the function of this enzyme in vivo, the Escherichia coli rph gene encoding RNase PH was interrupted with either a kanamycin resistance or a chloramphenicol resistance cassette and transferred to the chromosome of a variety of RNase-resistant strains. Inactivation of the chromosomal copy of rph eliminated RNase PH activity from extracts and also slowed the growth of many of the strains, particularly ones that already were deficient in RNase T or polynucleotide phosphorylase. Introduction of the rph mutation into a strain already lacking RNases I, II, D, BN, and T resulted in inviability. The rph mutation also had dramatic effects on tRNA metabolism. Using an in vivo suppressor assay we found that elimination of RNase PH greatly decreased the level of su3+ activity in cells deficient in certain of the other RNases. Moreover, in an in vitro tRNA processing system the defect caused by elimination of RNase PH was shown to be the accumulation of a precursor that contained 4-6 additional 3' nucleotides following the -CCA sequence. These data indicate that RNase PH can be an essential enzyme for the processing of tRNA precursors."
https://openalex.org/W1499373702,"Platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) is a disulfide-linked dimeric protein composed of two homologous polypeptide chains denoted A and B. Two types of PDGF receptors, alpha and beta, have been characterized. Whereas PDGF-AA binds only to PDGF alpha-receptors, PDGF-BB binds to both receptor types with high affinity. To map the regions of the PDGF B-chain that confer its ability to bind with high affinity to the PDGF beta-receptor, we expressed PDGF A/B-chain chimeras in COS cells and analyzed them with regard to PDGF alpha- and beta-receptor binding. A systematic analysis revealed that replacement of Asn-115, Arg-154, and Ile-158 of the PDGF B-chain with the corresponding A-chain amino acids led to a dramatic decrease in the affinity for the beta-receptor. Conversely, introduction of B-chain amino acids into the A-chain in the region spanning from Asn-115 to Ile-158 yielded a product with high affinity for the beta-receptor. These data thus indicate that Asn-115, Arg-154, and Ile-158 are likely to be part of the active site of the PDGF B-chain."
https://openalex.org/W1554528630,"Abstract We developed an in vitro system to reproduce a site- and strand-specific nicking at the oriT region of plasmid R100. The nicking reaction was dependent on the purified TraY protein and on the lysate, which was prepared from cells overproducing the TraI protein. This supports the idea that the protein products of two genes, traY and traI, constitute an endonuclease that introduces a specific nick in vivo in the oriT region of the conjugative plasmids related to R100. The products were the complex DNA molecules with a protein covalently linked with the 5'-end of the nick. The nick was introduced in the strand, which is supposed to be transferred to recipient cells during conjugation, and was located at the site 59 base pairs upstream of the TraY protein binding site, sbyA."

This finding was substantiated by experimental evidence including (i) extensive copurification of an activity required for U6 transcription with TFIIA, (ii) the comparable molecular dimensions of this activity and TFIIA, (iii) the identical heat stability of both activities, and (iv) functional analyses revealing that TFIIA facilitates the interaction of TFIID with the TATA box of the U6 gene. As was shown previously for TFIID, TFIIA is the second basal transcription factor which could be demonstrated to be involved in gene expression by two different RNA polymerases."
https://openalex.org/W1530045241,"Thrombospondin (TS) mediates attachment, spreading, and motility of several cell types through at least four cell binding domains: the amino-terminal heparin binding domain, the type I repeats containing the CSVTCG sequence, the RGDA sequence in the last of the type III calcium binding repeats and the carboxyl-terminal cell or platelet binding domain (CBD). The attachment of human melanoma cells (G361) to the COOH-terminal domain is independent of the RGDA sequence and is inhibited by the monoclonal antibody C6.7. To define the cell binding site(s) within this 212-residue COOH-terminal domain, we have synthesized eight overlapping peptides (seven 30-mers and a final 37-mer) representing the entire sequence of the CBD. Several of these peptides are insoluble in aqueous buffers at high concentration. Cell adhesion assays have been devised which employ covalent coupling of peptides in chaotropic solvents to chemically derivatized plastic 96-well plates. Three synthetic peptides, two of which are nonadjacent in the linear sequence, are potent attachment factors for G361 cells. C6.7 blocks adhesion to one of these peptides, whereas sulfated glycoconjugates inhibit adhesion of cells to all three. Polyclonal antibodies raised against the peptides inhibit cell adhesion to the peptides, the recombinant CBD, and to intact TS. The peptides GRGDSP and VTCG are not inhibitory. These sites are thus independent from the type I repeats and the RGDA sequence of TS. Each of the active peptides inhibits cell attachment to the other active peptides as well as to the CBD and to intact TS. This mutual inhibition suggests that the peptides share a common cellular receptor which may contain an associated glycoconjugate chain. These data indicate that the COOH-terminal cell binding domain of TS contains at least two peptide sequences which contribute to the attachment of a wide variety of cells."

Nearly half the phosphophoryn residues are serines, and 85-90% of these are phosphorylated. Since phosphorylation may be important for phosphophoryn function, it was of interest to identify the kinase(s) responsible for catalyzing their phosphophorylation. Rat osteosarcoma (ROS) 17/2.8 osteoblast-like cells were selected as the enzyme source. Native rat incisor phosphophoryns (RIPP-I, II, III) were not substrates for any of the ROS 17/2.8 messenger-dependent kinases but were phosphorylated by membrane-associated endogenous messenger-independent kinases. These were resolved chromatographically and identified as casein kinase (CK) I and II by elution properties and immunoblotting with a CKII antibody. The CKI preferentially used RIPP-III as substrate, while CKII preferred RIPP-I and II. Heparin at 100 and 500 ng/assay and NaCl at 0.25-0.4 M inhibited phosphorylation of the RIPP by CKI and CKII in parallel. At 10 mM spermine, phosphorylation of RIPP-I and II by CKII, and of RIPP-III by CKI were inhibited, but phosphorylation of RIPP-III by CKII was enhanced. Purified sea star oocyte CKII demonstrated the same substrate specificity and spermine concentration shift as the ROS 17/2.8 CKII. These data show that osteoblast-like cells are a rich source of membrane-bound CKI and CKII activity. The different patterns of phosphorylation of RIPP-I, II, and III further show that they are distinct synthetic products of the odontoblast."
https://openalex.org/W1537013342,"We have expressed an active recombinant E1 decarboxylase component of the mammalian branched-chain alpha-ketoacid dehydrogenase complex in Escherichia coli by subcloning mature E1 alpha and E1 beta subunit cDNA sequences into a bacterial expression vector. To permit affinity purification under native conditions, the mature E1 alpha subunit was fused with the affinity ligand E. coli maltose-binding protein (MBP) through an endoprotease Factor Xa-specific linker peptide. When co-expressed, the MBP-E1 alpha fusion and E1 beta subunits were shown to co-purify as a MBP-E1 component that exhibited both E1 activity and binding competence for recombinant branched-chain E2 component. In contrast, in vitro mixing of individually expressed MBP-E1 alpha and E1 beta did not result in assembly or produce E1 activity. Following proteolytic removal of the affinity ligand and linker peptide with Factor Xa, a recombinant E1 species was eluted from a Sephacryl S-300HR sizing column as an enzymatically active 160-kDa species. The latter showed 1:1 subunit stoichiometry, which was consistent with an alpha 2 beta 2 structure. The recovery of this 160-kDa recombinant E1 species (estimated at 0.07% of total lysate protein) was low, with the majority of the recombinant protein lost as insoluble aggregates. Our findings suggest that the concurrent expression of both E1 alpha and E1 beta subunits in the same cellular compartment is important for assembly of both subunits into a functional E1 alpha 2 beta 2 heterotetramer. By using this co-expression system, we also find that the E1 alpha missense mutation (Tyr-393—-Asn) characterized in Mennonites with maple syrup urine disease prevents the assembly of soluble E1 heterotetramers."
https://openalex.org/W2164076395,"The mechanisms responsible for decreased levels of cAMP-dependent protein kinase activity in a mutant Chinese hamster ovary cell line have been examined. The cAMP-resistant Chinese hamster ovary 10260 cell line was found to possess only 20% of the cAMP-dependent protein kinase activity found in wild-type cells. The presence of decreased concentrations of the catalytic subunit in these cells was confirmed through binding studies using a radiolabeled, heat-stable inhibitor of the kinase. Cloned Chinese hamster ovary catalytic subunit cDNAs were isolated, characterized, and used as hybridization probes to examine the relative concentrations of catalytic subunit mRNAs in the wild-type and 10260 cell lines. A 40-50% decrease in the concentration of the mRNA for the C alpha isozyme of the catalytic subunit was observed in 10260 cells, as compared with wild-type. This decrease in catalytic subunit mRNA concentration probably accounts for a portion of the decreased kinase activity in the mutant cells. Further analysis of C alpha mRNA by polymerase chain reaction confirmed the decreased expression of C alpha mRNA in 10260 cells and further demonstrated the presence of two different species of C alpha mRNA in the 10260 cells. One species of C alpha cDNAs was indistinguishable from the wild-type cDNA, but the other species was shorter. Nucleotide sequence analysis of the amplified cDNAs led to the identification of a 191-base pair deletion in the shorter cDNA. Gene transfer studies using wild-type and 10260 C alpha cDNAs demonstrated that the longer cDNA from the 10260 cells produced wild-type activity, but the shorter cDNA was inactive. These studies suggest that at least two alterations in gene expression are responsible for decreased cAMP-dependent protein kinase activity in the 10260 cell line. One alteration results in an approximately 2-fold decrease in the concentrations of C alpha mRNA in the cells. The other change produces two species of C alpha mRNA; one of the C alpha mRNAs does not encode an active kinase."
https://openalex.org/W1563489425,"A novel enzyme activity was found in bovine brain cytosol that transfers the ADP-ribosyl moiety of NAD to proteins with Mr values of 22,000 and 25,000. The substrates were the same GTP-binding proteins serving as the substrate of an ADP-ribosyltransferase C3 which was produced by a type C strain of Clostridium botulinum. The brain enzyme was partially purified from the cytosol and had a molecular mass of approximately 20,000 on a gel filtration column. The brain endogenous enzyme displayed unique properties similar to those observed with botulinum C3 enzyme. The enzyme activity was markedly stimulated by a protein factor that had been initially found in the cytosol as an activator for botulinum C3-catalyzed ADP-ribosylation (Ohtsuka, T., Nagata, K., Iiri, T., Nozawa, Y., Ueno, K., Ui, M., and Katada, T. (1989) J. Biol. Chem. 264, 15000-15005). The activity of the brain enzyme was also affected by certain types of detergents or phospholipids. The substrate of the brain enzyme was specific for GTP-binding proteins serving as the substrate of botulinum C3 enzyme; the alpha-subunits of trimeric GTP-binding proteins which served as the substrate of cholera or pertussis toxin were not ADP-ribosylated by the endogenous enzyme. Thus, this is the first report showing an endogenous enzyme in mammalian cells that catalyzes ADP-ribosylation of small molecular weight GTP-binding proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1561016864,"The most common form of hereditary systemic amyloidosis is familial amyloidotic polyneuropathy associated with single amino acid changes in the plasma protein, transthyretin. In addition, there are two variants of transthyretin (Ser6 and Thr109) not associated with familial amyloidotic polyneuropathy but with familial euthyroid hyperthyroxinemia, also an autosomal dominant disorder. In these autosomal dominant diseases, most affected individuals are heterozygous and therefore have hybrid forms of the tetrameric plasma transthyretin. In order to study the structure/function relationships of homozygous variant transthyretins, normal human transthyretin and five variant transthyretins (Gly6----Ser, Leu58----His, Thr60----Ala, Ile84----Ser, and Ala109----Thr) were produced in Escherichia coli using the expression vector, pCZ11, and site-directed mutagenesis. These recombinant transthyretin (r-TTR) proteins showed the correct size (14 kilodaltons) on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and Western analysis and self-associated into tetramers as determined by size exclusion chromatography. Recombinant normal, Ser6, and Ala60 r-TTRs had an affinity for thyroxine indistinguishable from normal human TTR purified from plasma, whereas His58 and Ser84 r-TTRs had significantly reduced affinity. On the other hand, Thr109 r-TTR had a much higher affinity, probably due to its position within the thyroxine-binding pocket. Expression of mutant transthyretins in E. coli provides the opportunity to study structure/function relationships and amyloid-forming capabilities induced by single amino acid substitutions in the transthyretin molecule."

These bacterial strains contained multicopy plasmids carrying an rrnH operon with wild type (pLC7-21) or mutated (A2058----U transversion) 23 S rRNA gene. Ribosomes with wild type and mutated rRNA were both present in EM4/pERY. The latter particles did not bind VS; in the presence of VM, however, high affinity VS binding occurred. As shown previously, VS protected against chemical reagents certain bases in domain V rRNA and VM in the stems flanking this loop. Differences between wild type and mutant ribosomes were observed: A2058, A2059, A2062, and G2505, protected by VS and ERY in EM4/pLC7-21, were unshielded in EM4/pERY. A2062 was shielded by VM in EM4/pERY, not in EM4/pLC7-21, and G2505 of mutant ribosomes became protected by VS when VM was simultaneously present. Induction by VM of a high affinity VS binding site in VS-sensitive and -resistant ribosomes indicates A2058 mutation to entail a conformational change of this site, which is counteracted by VM fixation. Accessibility of A2062 to chemical reagents (unlike behavior of EM4/pERY and EM4/pLC7-21 in the presence of VM) implies different conformations for wild type and mutant ribosomes."
https://openalex.org/W1484174120,"Mutant 5 S rRNA genes were expressed in Saccharomyces cerevisiae to further define the function of the ribosomal 5 S RNA. RNA synthesis and utilization were assayed using previously constructed markers which have been shown to be functionally neutral and easily detected by gel electrophoresis. Most mutations were found not to affect the growth rate because they were poorly expressed or could be accommodated effectively in the ribosomal structure. Two of the mutants, Y5A99U56U57 and Y5U90i5 adversely affected cell growth as well as protein synthesis in vitro. Polyribosome profiles in both of these mutants were substantially shorter, and an analysis of the ribosomal subunit composition revealed a significant imbalance with a 25-35% excess in 40 S subunits. Kinetic analyses of RNA labeling indicated very low cellular levels of mutant RNA either because it was poorly expressed (Y5U90i5) or rapidly degraded before being incorporated into mature 60 subunits (Y5A99U56U57). The results suggest that the 5 S RNA is required for the assembly of stable ribosomal 60 S subunits and raise the possibility that this RNA or, more likely, its corresponding ribonucleoprotein complex is critical for subunit assembly or even RNA processing."
https://openalex.org/W1553483796,"We have studied the heme oxidation kinetics of purified human hemoglobin (Hb) in the presence of lipid vesicles of dipalmitoyl phosphatidylcholine and bovine brain phosphatidylserine that exhibited minimal lipid peroxidation. We showed that the lipid vesicles enhanced Hb oxidation and that small unilamellar vesicles (SUVs) exerted a larger effect than large unilamellar vesicles (LUVs). We have determined pseudo first-order rate constants for the initial disappearance of oxygenated ferrous Hb (k0) and for the initial formation of several ferric Hb species (methemoglobin, hemichrome, and choleglobin) in the presence of SUVs and LUVs. k0 and other rate constants depended linearly on lipid-to-hemoglobin molar ratio (lipid/Hb), with k0SUV (h-1) = k0auto (h-1) + 3.7 x 10(-3) x lipid/Hb, and k0LUV (h-1) = k0auto (h-1) + 0.2 x 10(-3) x lipid/hb, where k0auto is the rate constant for Hb autoxidation in the absence of vesicles. Thus, in the absence of lipid peroxidation products, lipid vesicles themselves promote Hb oxidation by enhancing the rate of Hb oxidation. The enhanced oxidation was inhibited by catalase, but not by butylated hydroxytoluene. The rate constants were independent of Hb concentration, in the range of about 3.1 to 100 microM. We suggest that the lipid surface properties, including surface curvature, surface energy, and hydrophobicity, promote hemoglobin oxidation."
https://openalex.org/W1583062825,"During chemically induced differentiation of murine erythroleukemia (MEL) cells, cAMP-dependent protein kinase activity increases, and the enzyme's isozyme pattern changes. To examine the enzyme's role during MEL cell differentiation, we stably transfected MEL cells with recombinant plasmids in which the mouse metallothionein I promoter controlled expression of either a mutant form of the type I regulatory subunit of cAMP-dependent protein kinase (RI) or the enzyme's specific peptide inhibitor (PKI); expressing either sequence rendered cells cAMP-dependent protein kinase-deficient. Chemically induced differentiation of MEL cells as assessed by beta-globin mRNA and hemoglobin accumulation was inhibited in RI mutant and PKI transfectants; adding zinc further inhibited differentiation in the transfectants but had no effect on parental MEL cells. The inhibition of differentiation correlated with the amount of RI mutant mRNA and protein in the RI mutant transfectants and with the cells' degree of cAMP-dependent protein kinase deficiency in both the RI mutant and PKI transfectants. Overexpression of wild type RI did not interfere with differentiation or enzyme activity. We conclude that cAMP-dependent protein kinase activity is important for chemically induced differentiation of MEL cells and that the down-regulation of RI protein which occurs during MEL cell differentiation is not essential for differentiation to proceed."
https://openalex.org/W1597254873,"Abstract In order to investigate the function of Asp-327, a bidentate ligand of one of the zinc atoms in Escherichia coli alkaline phosphatase, and the importance of this zinc atom in catalysis, site-specific mutagenesis was used to convert Asp-327 to either asparagine or alanine. The 10(7)-fold decrease in the kcat/Km ratio observed for the Asp-327----Ala enzyme compared to the wild-type enzyme indicates that the side chain of Asp-327 is important for zinc binding at the M1 site. However, only one of the two carboxyl oxygens of Asp-327 is essential for zinc binding, since the Asp-327----Asn enzyme shows approximately the same hydrolysis activity as the wild-type enzyme. The fact that the enzymatic activity of this mutant enzyme shows a dependence on zinc concentration suggests that the other carboxyl oxygen or the negative charge on the side chain of Asp-327 is important in binding of the zinc at the M1 site. However, the zinc hydroxyl must still be appropriately positioned to attack the phosphoserine in the Asp-327----Asn enzyme; therefore, the negative charge and at least one carboxyl oxygen of the side chain are not directly involved in positioning or deprotonating the zinc hydroxyl. 31P NMR studies indicate that the Asp-327----Asn enzyme exhibits transphosphorylation activity at both pH 8.0 and pH 10.0, but at a reduced level compared to the wild-type enzyme. The biphasic production of 2,4-dinitrophenylate in the pre-steady-state kinetics of the mutant enzymes at pH 5.5 suggests that the breaking of the phosphoenzyme covalent complex is rate-limiting for both mutant enzymes. These results suggest that the main function of the zinc atom at the M1 site in catalysis involves decomposition of the phosphoenzyme covalent complex and that it may be important in helping to stabilize the alcohol leaving group."
https://openalex.org/W1542459655,"The new model for the tertiary structure of ribosomal 5 S rRNA from plants recently proposed by some of us has been already supported by RNase H digestions in the presence of complementary oligodeoxynucleotides. These results are confirmed now by the new biochemical and NMR spectroscopy data. Diethylpyrocarbonate (DEP) and monoperphthalic acid (MPA) are the reagents with the high specificity toward single-stranded adenosine residues. Our experiments clearly show that under native conditions adenosine 100 (A100) of lupin 5 S rRNA is not available for reaction toward these reagents. However under denaturing conditions this residue reacts with DEP and MPA. The detailed analysis of the lupin 5 S rRNA by NMR spectra provide the data on the specific interaction of A100-U53. Thus, we have seen for the first time the NMR signal due to the A100-U53 tertiary base pair, which as we believe, stabilizes interactions between loops B and E."
https://openalex.org/W1607163477,"In this report we describe the purification of the murine interleukin 3 receptor (mIL-3R) to apparent homogeneity using a two-step procedure involving biotinylated mIL-3 (B-mIL-3) and affinity binding to immobilized antiphosphotyrosine and streptavidin agarose (SA). Purification was monitored using an assay for detergent solubilized-mIL-3Rs that utilized unglycosylated 125I-mIL-3 and concanavalin A (ConA)-Sepharose beads. The final material consisted of a 140-kDa tyrosine and serine phosphorylated protein that was greater than 98% pure as assessed by sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of either [35S]methionine-labeled, silver-stained, or radioiodinated preparations. Characterization of the purified receptor revealed that it migrated identically under reducing and nonreducing conditions in SDS gels, possessed 10 kDa of N-linked carbohydrate, and was cleaved upon storage at 4 degrees C to a 70-kDa form. These properties suggested that the purified mIL-3R was identical to that identified by cross-linking studies. The KD of the purified receptor was 1-5 nM, similar to estimates obtained using intact normal mouse bone marrow cells and mIL-3-dependent cell lines. The two-step purification procedure also isolated a 120-kDa serine phosphorylated but nontyrosine phosphorylated mIL-3R species. Apart from phosphorylation differences, the 140- and 120-kDa species were apparently identical, yielding, after alkaline phosphatase treatment, the same molecular mass on SDS gels and similar chymotryptic peptide maps. Amino acid sequences and composition data obtained from the more abundant and more stable serine phosphorylated 120-kDa mIL-3R, further purified by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, suggested that the purified mIL-3R may be identical to the predicted sequence of the recently isolated cDNA clone AIC2A. This was further suggested by comparing chymotryptic maps of the 120-kDa mIL-3R with the Aic2A protein and using antibodies corresponding to the amino and carboxyl termini of the AIC2A cDNA product. However, the Aic2A protein, when expressed on the surface of COS or 3T3 cells or following detergent solubilization and partial purification with biotinylated mIL-3 and SA, displayed a substantially lower affinity for mIL-3."
https://openalex.org/W1499618301,"The kringle-2 domain of tissue plasminogen activator, cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli (Wilhelm, O.G., Jaskunas, S.R., Vlahos, C.J., and Bang, N.U. (1990) J. Biol. Chem. 265, 14606-14611), was internally radiolabeled using [35S]methionine-cysteine. Following refolding and isolation, the labeled polypeptide was further purified by reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography. The purified kringle-2 domain was digested with thermolysin, and the resulting peptides were purified by high performance liquid chromatography. Five major peptides containing 35S were obtained. Amino acid sequence analysis showed that these peptides represented various cleavage products containing one or more of the following disulfides: Cys180-Cys261, Cys201-Cys243, Cys232-Cys256 (sequence numbering based on Pennica et al. (Pennica, D., Holmes, W.E., Kohr, W.J., Hakins, R.N., Vehar, G. A., Ward, C.A., Bennett, W.F., Yelverton E., Seeburg, P.H., Heynecker, H.L., Goeddel, E.V., and Collen, D. (1983) Nature 301, 214-221)). These results confirm that the refolding methodology used produced kringle-2 with the predicted disulfide linkage and, thus, yielded material suitable for structural and functional studies."
