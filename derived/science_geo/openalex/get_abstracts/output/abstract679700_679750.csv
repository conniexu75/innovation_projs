https://openalex.org/W3194798235,"SARS-CoV-2 infections have surged across the globe in recent months, concomitant with considerable viral evolution1-3. Extensive mutations in the spike protein may threaten the efficacy of vaccines and therapeutic monoclonal antibodies4. Two signature spike mutations of concern are E484K, which has a crucial role in the loss of neutralizing activity of antibodies, and N501Y, a driver of rapid worldwide transmission of the B.1.1.7 lineage. Here we report the emergence of the variant lineage B.1.526 (also known as the Iota variant5), which contains E484K, and its rise to dominance in New York City in early 2021. This variant is partially or completely resistant to two therapeutic monoclonal antibodies that are in clinical use and is less susceptible to neutralization by plasma from individuals who had recovered from SARS-CoV-2 infection or serum from vaccinated individuals, posing a modest antigenic challenge. The presence of the B.1.526 lineage has now been reported in all 50 states in the United States and in many other countries. B.1.526 rapidly replaced earlier lineages in New York, with an estimated transmission advantage of 35%. These transmission dynamics, together with the relative antibody resistance of its E484K sub-lineage, are likely to have contributed to the sharp rise and rapid spread of B.1.526. Although SARS-CoV-2 B.1.526 initially outpaced B.1.1.7 in the region, its growth subsequently slowed concurrently with the rise of B.1.1.7 and ensuing variants."
https://openalex.org/W3195873365,"S-acylation, also known as palmitoylation, is the most widely prevalent form of protein lipidation, whereby long-chain fatty acids get attached to cysteine residues facing the cytosol. In humans, 23 members of the zDHHC family of integral membrane enzymes catalyze this modification. S-acylation is critical for the life cycle of many enveloped viruses. The Spike protein of SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of COVID-19, has the most cysteine-rich cytoplasmic tail among known human pathogens in the closely related family of β-coronaviruses; however, it is unclear which of the cytoplasmic cysteines are S-acylated, and what the impact of this modification is on viral infectivity. Here we identify specific cysteine clusters in the Spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 that are targets of S-acylation. Interestingly, when we investigated the effect of the cysteine clusters using pseudotyped virus, mutation of the same three clusters of cysteines severely compromised viral infectivity. We developed a library of expression constructs of human zDHHC enzymes and used them to identify zDHHC enzymes that can S-acylate SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein. Finally, we reconstituted S-acylation of SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein in vitro using purified zDHHC enzymes. We observe a striking heterogeneity in the S-acylation status of the different cysteines in our in cellulo experiments, which, remarkably, was recapitulated by the in vitro assay. Altogether, these results bolster our understanding of a poorly understood posttranslational modification integral to the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein. This study opens up avenues for further mechanistic dissection and lays the groundwork toward developing future strategies that could aid in the identification of targeted small-molecule modulators."
https://openalex.org/W3193629630,"The newly emerged and rapidly spreading SARS-CoV-2 causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). To facilitate a deeper understanding of the viral biology we developed a capture sequencing methodology to generate SARS-CoV-2 genomic and transcriptome sequences from infected patients. We utilized an oligonucleotide probe-set representing the full-length genome to obtain both genomic and transcriptome (subgenomic open reading frames [ORFs]) sequences from 45 SARS-CoV-2 clinical samples with varying viral titers. For samples with higher viral loads (cycle threshold value under 33, based on the CDC qPCR assay) complete genomes were generated. Analysis of junction reads revealed regions of differential transcriptional activity among samples. Mixed allelic frequencies along the 20kb ORF1ab gene in one sample, suggested the presence of a defective viral RNA species subpopulation maintained in mixture with functional RNA in one sample. The associated workflow is straightforward, and hybridization-based capture offers an effective and scalable approach for sequencing SARS-CoV-2 from patient samples."
https://openalex.org/W3194984871,"A remarkably well-preserved, almost complete and articulated new specimen (GP/2E 9266) of Tupandactylus navigans is here described for the Early Cretaceous Crato Formation of Brazil. The new specimen comprises an almost complete skeleton, preserving both the skull and post-cranium, associated with remarkable preservation of soft tissues, which makes it the most complete tapejarid known thus far. CT-Scanning was performed to allow the assessment of bones still covered by sediment. The specimen can be assigned to Tupa . navigans due to its vertical supra-premaxillary bony process and short and rounded parietal crest. It also bears the largest dentary crest among tapejarine pterosaurs and a notarium, which is absent in other representatives of the clade. The new specimen is here regarded as an adult individual. This is the first time that postcranial remains of Tupa . navigans are described, being also an unprecedented record of an articulated tapejarid skeleton from the Araripe Basin."
https://openalex.org/W3195358767,"Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is the third leading cause of mortality in the United States; however, COPD has heterogeneous clinical phenotypes. This is the first large scale attempt which uses transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics (multi-omics) to determine whether there are molecularly defined clusters with distinct clinical phenotypes that may underlie the clinical heterogeneity. Subjects included 3,278 subjects from the COPDGene cohort with at least one of the following profiles: whole blood transcriptomes (2,650 subjects); plasma proteomes (1,013 subjects); and plasma metabolomes (1,136 subjects). 489 subjects had all three contemporaneous -omics profiles. Autoencoder embeddings were performed individually for each -omics dataset. Embeddings underwent subspace clustering using MineClus, either individually by -omics or combined, followed by recursive feature selection based on Support Vector Machines. Clusters were tested for associations with clinical variables. Optimal single -omics clustering typically resulted in two clusters. Although there was overlap for individual -omics cluster membership, each -omics cluster tended to be defined by unique molecular pathways. For example, prominent molecular features of the metabolome-based clustering included sphingomyelin, while key molecular features of the transcriptome-based clusters were related to immune and bacterial responses. We also found that when we integrated the -omics data at a later stage, we identified subtypes that varied based on age, severity of disease, in addition to diffusing capacity of the lungs for carbon monoxide, and precent on atrial fibrillation. In contrast, when we integrated the -omics data at an earlier stage by treating all data sets equally, there were no clinical differences between subtypes. Similar to clinical clustering, which has revealed multiple heterogenous clinical phenotypes, we show that transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics tend to define clusters of COPD patients with different clinical characteristics. Thus, integrating these different -omics data sets affords additional insight into the molecular nature of COPD and its heterogeneity."
https://openalex.org/W3194251568,"The purpose of the present study was to investigate how various laboratory- and field-based tests predict on-snow cross-country (XC) skiing and roller-skiing performance. Thirty-three national-level male XC skiers (19.0±2.5 years, maximal oxygen uptake [VO2max] 70.8±4.7 mL·min-1·kg-1) performed a 13.6-km roller-ski skating competition tracked by a global positioning system (GPS), which together with individual distance International Ski Federation (FIS) points was used to assess their performance level. On separate days, time in a 6.4-km uphill running time-trial (RUN-TT) and 1.3-km uphill roller-ski double-poling time-trial (DP-TT) was measured in the field and performance indices determined while running and roller-ski skating in the laboratory. The mean finishing times for the RUN-TT and the DP-TT showed moderate to large correlations with distance FIS points and performance in the roller-ski skating competition (r = 0.56-0.72; all p<0.05). RUN-TT was more strongly correlated with distance FIS points than DP-TT (r = 0.72 versus 0.56; p<0.05). Performance indices and VO2max in incremental running and roller-ski skating in the laboratory showed large to very large correlations with distance FIS points and roller-skiing performance (r = 0.50-0.90; all p<0.05). Performance indices and VO2max in running tended to be more strongly correlated with roller-skiing performance than corresponding values obtained while roller-ski skating (all p<0.10). The present findings suggest that both laboratory performance indices and field-based performance tests provide valid predictions of XC skiing and roller-skiing performance in a heterogeneous group of male XC skiers, with test values obtained in running tending to be more strongly correlated with XC skiing performance than those found for technique-specific modalities on roller skis. However, more sophisticated and mode-specific testing might be required for more homogenous groups of elite XC skiers."
https://openalex.org/W3194156178,"Torquetenovirus (TTV) is present in biological fluids from healthy individuals and measurement of its titer is used to assess immune status in individuals with chronic infections and after transplants. We assessed if the titer of TTV in saliva varied with the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in the nasopharynx and could be a marker of COVID-19 status. Saliva from 91 individuals positive for SARS-CoV-2 in nasal-oropharyngeal samples, and from 126 individuals who were SARS-CoV-2-negative, all with mild respiratory symptoms, were analyzed. Both groups were similar in age, gender, symptom duration and time after symptom initiation when saliva was collected. Titers of TTV and SARS-CoV-2 were assessed by gene amplification. Loss of smell (p = 0.0001) and fever (p = 0.0186) were more prevalent in SARS-CoV-2-positive individuals, while sore throat (p = 0.0001), fatigue (p = 0.0037) and diarrhea (p = 0.0475) were more frequent in the SARS-CoV-2 negative group. The saliva TTV and nasal-oropharyngeal SARS-CoV-2 titers were correlated (p = 0.0085). The TTV level decreased as symptoms resolved in the SARS-CoV-2 infected group (p = 0.0285) but remained unchanged in the SARS-CoV-2 negative controls. In SARS-CoV-2 positive subjects who provided 2–4 saliva samples and in which TTV was initially present, the TTV titer always decreased over time as symptoms resolved. We propose that sequential TTV measurement in saliva is potentially useful to assess the likelihood of symptom resolution in SARS-CoV-2-positive individuals and to predict prognosis."
https://openalex.org/W3194502230,"Objectives Several systematic reviews and meta-analyses on short-term outcomes between total hip arthroplasty (THA) through direct anterior approach (DAA) compared to THA through conventional (including anterior, anterolateral, lateral transgluteal, lateral transtrochanteric, posterior, and posterolateral) approaches (CAs) in treatment of hip diseases and fractures showed contradicting conclusions. Our aim was to draw definitive conclusions by conducting both a fixed and random model meta-analysis of quality randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and by comparison with related meta-analyses. Design We performed a systematic literature search up to May 2020 to identify RCTs, comparing THA through DAA with THA through CAs and related meta-analyses. We conducted risk of bias and level of evidence assessment in accordance with the Cochrane’s Risk of Bias 2 tool and with the guidelines of the Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine. We estimated mean differences (MD) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) through fixed and random effects models, using the DerSimonian and Laird method. Heterogeneity was assessed using tau-square (τ 2 ). Our conclusions take into account the overall results from related meta-analyses. Results Nine studies on THA through DAA met the criteria for final meta-analysis, involving 998 patients. Three studies were blinded RCTs with a level I evidence, the other 6 studies were non-blinded RCTs with a level II evidence. We came to the following results for THA through DAA compared to THA through CAs: operation time (I 2 = 92%, p&lt;0.01; fixed: MD = 15.1, 95% CI 13.1 to 17.1; random: MD = 18.1, 95% CI 8.6 to 27.5); incision length (I 2 = 100%, p&lt;0.01; fixed: MD = -2.9, 95% CI -3.0 to -2.8; MD = -1.1, 95% CI -4.3 to 2.0); intraoperative blood loss (I 2 = 87%, p&lt;0.01; fixed: MD = 51.5, 95% CI 34.1 to 68.8; random: MD = 51.9, 95% CI -89.8 to 193.5); VAS 1 day postoperatively (I 2 = 79%, p = 0.03; fixed: MD = -0.8, 95% CI -1.2 to -0.4; random: MD = -0.9, 95% CI -2.0 to 0.15); HHS 3 months postoperatively (I 2 = 52%, p = 0.08; fixed: MD = 2.8, 95% CI 1.1 to 4.6; random: MD = 3.0, 95% CI -0.5 to 6.5); HHS 6 months postoperatively (I 2 = 0%, p = 0.67; fixed: MD = 0.9, 95% CI -1.1 to 2.9; random: MD = 0.9, 95% CI -1.1 to 2.9); HHS 12 months postoperatively (I 2 = 0%, p = 0.79; fixed: MD = 0.7, 95% CI -0.9 to 2.4; random: MD = 0.7, 95% CI -0.9 to 2.4). We compared our findings with 7 related meta-analyses. Conclusions Considering the results of our meta-analysis and the review of related meta-analyses, we can conclude that short-term outcomes of THA through DAA were overall better than THA through CAs. THA through DAA had a shorter incision length, a tendency towards a lower pain VAS 1 day postoperatively and better early postoperative functional outcome than THA through CAs. The intraoperative blood loss showed indifferent results. THA through DAA had a longer operation time than THA through CAs."
https://openalex.org/W3194580041,"Suicidal ideation (SI) among pregnant women is a major public health concern worldwide and is associated with a higher risk of completed suicide. However, there are limited studies that determined the prevalence and the potential determinants of suicidal ideation in Sub-Saharan Africa, including Ethiopia. Therefore, this study aimed to explore the prevalence of suicidal ideation and associated factors among pregnant women attending antenatal care in Jimma, Ethiopia.An institutional-based cross-sectional study was conducted among 423 pregnant women attending Jimma medical center in Southwest, Ethiopia. A systematic random sampling technique was used to select the study participants. Suicidal ideation assessed using the Suicidality Module of the World Mental Health survey initiative version of the World Health Organization Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI). Other tools used are EPDS, Abuse Assessment Scale (AAS), DASS -21, PSS, Maternity Social Support Scale (MSSS), and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). A multivariable logistic regression analysis was used to explore the potential determinants of suicidal ideation among the participants.The prevalence of SI among women who are on antenatal care was found to be 13.3% (95% CI (10.1,16.4). In multivariable analysis, marital status with lack of cohabiting partners (AOR = 2.80,95%CI:1.23,6.37), history of abortion (AOR = 2.45,95% CI:1.03,5.93), having depression (AOR = 4.28,95% CI:1.75,10.44),anxiety(AOR = 2.99,95% CI:1.24,7.20), poor sleep quality (AOR = 2.85,95% CI:1.19,6.79), stress (AOR = 2.50, 95% CI:1.01,5.67), and intimate partner violence (AOR = 2.43, 95% CI:1.07,5.47) were found to be significant predictors of suicidal ideation.The prevalence of SI among pregnant women was found to be huge. Lack of cohabiting partners, previous history of abortion, depression, anxiety, intimate partner violence, poor sleep quality, and stress were variables that are independent predictors of suicidal ideation. Screening and interventions of antenatal SI are needed."
https://openalex.org/W3195496270,"Learning knowledge or skills usually is considered to be based on the formation of an adequate internal mental model as a specific type of mental network. The learning process for such a mental model conceptualised as a mental network, is a form of (first-order) mental network adaptation. Such learning often integrates learning by observation and learning by instruction. For an effective learning process, an appropriate timing of these different elements is crucial. By controlling the timing of them, the mental network adaptation process becomes adaptive itself, which is called second-order mental network adaptation. In this paper, a second-order adaptive mental network model is proposed addressing this. The first-order adaptation process models the learning process of mental models and the second-order adaptation process controls the timing of the elements of this learning process. It is illustrated by a case study for the learner-controlled mental model learning in the context of driving a car. Here the learner is in control of the integration of learning by observation and learning by instruction."
https://openalex.org/W3194558309,"Amyloidosis comprises a spectrum of disorders characterized by the extracellular deposition of amorphous material, originating from an abnormal serum protein. The typing of amyloid into its many variants represents a pivotal step for a correct patient management. Several methods are currently used, including mass spectrometry, immunofluorescence, immunohistochemistry, and immunogold labeling. The aim of the present study was to investigate the accuracy and reliability of immunohistochemistry by means of a recently developed amyloid antibody panel applicable on fixed paraffin-embedded tissues in an automated platform. Patients with clinically and pathologically proven amyloidosis were divided into two cohorts: a pilot one, which included selected amyloidosis cases from 2009 to 2018, and a retrospective one (comprising all consecutive amyloidosis cases analyzed between November 2018 and May 2020). The above-referred panel of antibodies for amyloid classification was tested in all cases using an automated immunohistochemistry platform. When fresh-frozen material was available, immunofluorescence was also performed. Among 130 patients, a total of 143 samples from different organs was investigated. They corresponded to 51 patients from the pilot cohort and 79 ones from the retrospective cohort. In 82 cases (63%), fresh-frozen tissue was tested by immunofluorescence, serving to define amyloid subtype only in 30 of them (36.6%). On the contrary, the automated immunohistochemistry procedure using the above-referred new antibodies allowed to establish the amyloid type in all 130 cases (100%). These included: ALλ (n = 60, 46.2%), ATTR (n = 29, 22.3%), AA (n = 19, 14.6%), ALκ (n = 18, 13.8%), ALys (n = 2, 1.5%), and Aβ2M amyloidosis (n = 2, 1.5%). The present immunohistochemistry antibody panel represents a sensitive, reliable, fast, and low-cost method for amyloid typing. Since immunohistochemistry is available in most pathology laboratories, it may become the new gold standard for amyloidosis classification, either used alone or combined with mass spectrometry in selected cases."
https://openalex.org/W3196251913,"Introduction To improve retention on HIV treatment in Africa, public health programs are promoting a family of innovations to service delivery—referred to as “differentiated service delivery” (DSD) models—which seek to better meet the needs of both systems and patients by reducing unnecessary encounters, expanding access, and incorporating peers and patients in patient care. Data on the relative desirability of different models to target populations, which is currently sparse, can help guide prioritization of specific models during scale-up. Methods We conducted a discrete choice experiment to assess patient preferences for various characteristics of treatment services. Clinically stable people living with HIV were recruited from an HIV clinic in Kisumu, Kenya. We selected seven attributes of DSD models drawn from literature review and previous qualitative work. We created a balanced and orthogonal design to identify main term effects. A total of ten choice tasks were solicited per respondent. We calculated relative utility (RU) for each attribute level, a numerical representation of the strength of patient preference. Data were analyzed using a Hierarchical Bayesian model via Sawtooth Software. Results One hundred and four respondents (37.5% men, 41.1 years mean age) preferred receiving care at a health facility, compared with home-delivery or a community meeting point (RU = 69.3, -16.2, and -53.1, respectively; p &lt;&lt; 0.05); receiving those services from clinicians and pharmacists—as opposed to lay health workers or peers (RU = 21.5, 5.9, -24.5; p &lt; 0.05); and preferred an individual support system over a group support system (RU = 15.0 and 4.2; p &lt; 0.05). Likewise, patients strongly preferred longer intervals between both clinical reviews (RU = 40.1 and -50.7 for 6- and 1-month spacing, respectively; p &lt; 0.05) and between ART collections (RU = 33.6 and -49.5 for 6- and1-month spacing, respectively; p &lt; 0.05). Conclusion Although health systems find community- and peer-based DSD models attractive, clinically stable patients expressed a preference for facility-based care as long as clinical visits were extended to biannual. These data suggest that multi-month scripting and fast-track models best align with patient preferences, an insight which can help prioritize use of different DSD models in the region."
https://openalex.org/W3187238048,"The prevalence of dyslexia identification has increased significantly over the last two decades. Yet there is debate over whether there are distinct biological and cognitive differences between those with literacy difficulties and the subgroup of people identified as dyslexic. This is the first paper that provides evidence for this ongoing debate by investigating the socio-demographic factors, outside biology and cognition, that predict whether a child is identified as dyslexic in the UK. Using secondary data from the UK's Millennium Cohort Study, this paper examines the socio-demographic factors that predict whether a child's teacher identifies them as dyslexic at age 11. Gender, season of birth, socio-economic class and parental income are found to be significant predictors of the dyslexia label. Therefore, factors seemingly unrelated to the clinical aspects of dyslexia influence whether a child is identified as dyslexic in England and Wales. This suggests that label may not be evenly distributed across a population; furthermore, it may also indicate that resources for support may not be fairly allocated. The findings further support the argument that a 'dyslexic sub-group' within poor readers is created due to the impact of environmental factors. The results from this national-scale study thus questions the reliability, validity and moral integrity of the allocation of the dyslexia label across current education systems in the UK."
https://openalex.org/W3193340737,"Collision of falling in the mechanical harvesting process of sweet potato is one of the main causes of epidermal destruction and damage to sweet potato tubers. Therefore, a sweet potato mechanical characteristic test and a full-factor sweet potato drop test were designed. Based on the analysis of the fitting mathematical model, the impact of the drop height, collision material and sweet potato chunk size on the damage of the sweet potato were studied. The mathematical models were established by fitting analysis of the IBM SPSS Statistics 22 software between the drop height and the sweet potato chunk size with each test index (impact force, impact stress, broken skin area and damaged area). The critical epidermal destruction height and the critical damage height of a certain size of sweet potato when it collides with a collision material can be calculated by the mathematical model, and the critical epidermal destruction mass and critical damage mass of sweet potato when it falls from a certain height and collides with a collision material can also be calculated. Then a series of critical values (including critical epidermal destruction force value, critical epidermal destruction impact stress, critical damage force value, critical damage impact stress) of mechanical properties of sweet potato were obtained. The results show that the impact deformation of sweet potato includes both elastic and plastic ones, and has similar stress relaxation characteristics. The critical damage impact stress of sweet potato is that the average value of the impact stress on the contact surface is less than it’s Firmness. The results provided a theoretical basis for understanding the collision damage mechanism of sweet potato and how to reduce the damage during harvest."
https://openalex.org/W3193957600,"As the number of female forest landowners (FFLs) in the United States continues to rise, there is an increasing need to understand the perceptions of stakeholder groups about opportunities and challenges faced by FFLs in the context of sustainable forestland management. This study utilizes the technique of SWOT-AHP (Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Treats-Analytical Hierarchy Process) to understand the perceptions of four stakeholder groups (FFLs, private foresters, government representatives, and non-profits) in Georgia-a significant forestry state located in the Southern United States. Sixteen factors (four under each SWOT category) were selected through a comprehensive literature review and detailed interviews with individuals from the identified stakeholder groups. A survey was created using these factors that asked stakeholders to compare them in their respective SWOT categories. An additional survey was created for each stakeholder group where survey participants compared the highest-ranking factors in each SWOT category. We found that all stakeholder groups prioritized weaknesses over the other SWOT categories. Results showed a significant need for relevant educational outreach programs that cater specifically to FFLs. Additionally, researchers found a need to promote the interest of future generations in forestland management as all stakeholder groups felt that limited interest from future generations was the most important threat. This study will directly feed into regional, national, and international attempts to increase the participation of minority family forest landowners in sustainable forest management through integrated forest policy development."
https://openalex.org/W3194100407,"Background The Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak in 2019, has shocked the entire world. As an effort to control the disease spread, the Indian government declared a nationwide lockdown on March 25th, 2020. As dental treatment was considered high risk in the spread of COVID-19, dentistry became one of the most vulnerable professions during this time. Dental professionals had to face job layoffs, salary cuts in professional colleges, closure of private clinics resulting in huge psychological, moral, and financial crises. Studies during the previous and present pandemics have shown mental issues among health care workers necessitating institutional reforms, along with early care and support. A balance in the work-life amongst professionals is the key to better efficiency and, was majorly affected during the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown due to sudden unexpected changes. Hence this study was conducted to understand the changes they underwent both at home and professional front with a hypothesis that physical and mental health, activities, relationship status, and workplace influence the work-life balance. Methods A pre-validated questionnaire survey was done on dentists across India. Structural Equation Modelling and path analysis were applied to the data collected. Results The results of the study supported the hypothesis that factors like physical and mental health, activities, relationship status, and workplace influenced the work-life balance directly. A significant imbalance was seen amongst the female dentists. Conclusion The present study proved the unpreparedness among dental professionals. Hence an evolutionary phase in every field with better working protocols, robust mental health support, and a focus on strategies to face future such emergencies is required."
https://openalex.org/W3194389324,"Antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) are emerging contaminants causing serious global health concern. Interventions to address this concern include improving our understanding of methods for treating waste material of human and animal origin that are known to harbor ARGs. Anaerobic digestion is a commonly used process for treating dairy manure, and although effective in reducing ARGs, its mechanism of action is not clear. In this study, we used three ARGs to conducted a longitudinal bench scale anaerobic digestion experiment with various temperatures (28, 36, 44, and 52°C) in triplicate using fresh dairy manure for 30 days to evaluate the reduction of gene abundance. Three ARGs and two mobile genetic elements (MGEs) were studied: sulfonamide resistance gene ( sulII ), tetracycline resistance genes ( tetW ), macrolide-lincosamide-streptogramin B (MLSB) superfamily resistance genes ( erm F), class 1 integrase gene ( intI1 ), and transposase gene ( tnpA ). Genes were quantified by real-time quantitative PCR. Results show that the thermophilic anaerobic digestion (52°C) significantly reduced ( p &lt; 0.05) the absolute abundance of sulII (95%), intI1 (95%), tnpA (77%) and 16S rRNA gene (76%) after 30 days of digestion. A modified Collins–Selleck model was used to fit the decay curve, and results suggest that the gene reduction during the startup phase of anaerobic digestion (first 5 days) was faster than the later stage, and reductions in the first five days were more than 50% for most genes."
https://openalex.org/W3195347193,"Valproate (VPA) is a widely used mood stabilizer, but its therapeutic mechanism of action is not understood. This knowledge gap hinders the development of more effective drugs with fewer side effects. Using the yeast model to elucidate the effects of VPA on cellular metabolism, we determined that the drug upregulated expression of genes normally repressed during logarithmic growth on glucose medium and increased levels of activated (phosphorylated) Snf1 kinase, the major metabolic regulator of these genes. VPA also decreased the cytosolic pH (pHc) and reduced glycolytic production of 2/3-phosphoglycerate. ATP levels and mitochondrial membrane potential were increased, and glucose-mediated extracellular acidification decreased in the presence of the drug, as indicated by a smaller glucose-induced shift in pH, suggesting that the major P-type proton pump Pma1 was inhibited. Interestingly, decreasing the pHc by omeprazole-mediated inhibition of Pma1 led to Snf1 activation. We propose a model whereby VPA lowers the pHc causing a decrease in glycolytic flux. In response, Pma1 is inhibited and Snf1 is activated, resulting in increased expression of normally repressed metabolic genes. These findings suggest a central role for pHc in regulating the metabolic program of yeast cells.

Some aspects of VPA-mediated hepatotoxicity have been attributed to inhibition of mitochondrial bioenergetics by the drug (6Komulainen T. Lodge T. Hinttala R. Bolszak M. Pietila M. Koivunen P. Hakkola J. Poulton J. Morten K.J. Uusimaa J. Sodium valproate induces mitochondrial respiration dysfunction in HepG2 in vitro cell model.Toxicology. 2015; 331: 47-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Long-term treatment with VPA decreases cytochrome c oxidase activity (COX) (7Ponchaut S. van Hoof F. Veitch K. Cytochrome aa3 depletion is the cause of the deficient mitochondrial respiration induced by chronic valproate administration.Biochem. Pharmacol. 1992; 43: 644-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), most likely through direct inhibition (8Salsaa M. Pereira B. Liu J. Yu W. Jadhav S. Huttemann M. Greenberg M.L. Valproate inhibits mitochondrial bioenergetics and increases glycolysis in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.Sci. Rep. 2020; 10: 11785Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). The therapeutic mechanism of action of VPA is not understood (9Gould T.D. Quiroz J.A. Singh J. Zarate C.A. Manji H.K. Emerging experimental therapeutics for bipolar disorder: Insights from the molecular and cellular actions of current mood stabilizers.Mol. Psychiatry. 2004; 9: 734-755Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar), hindering the development of more effective mood stabilizers. Several hypotheses have been proposed to explain how mood stabilizers such as VPA and lithium mediate therapeutic effects. Because of the interrelatedness of pathways, these proposed mechanisms may not be mutually exclusive. This may be especially applicable to the inositol depletion hypothesis (10Berridge M.J. Calcium signalling and psychiatric disease: Bipolar disorder and schizophrenia.Cell Tissue Res. 2014; 357: 477-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 11Case K.C. Salsaa M. Yu W.

Windorfer A. Effect of sodium valproate on mania. The GABA-hypothesis of affective disorders.s. 1980; 229: 1-16Google Scholar). Mood stabilizers such as VPA and lithium inhibit enzymes in the inositol biosynthesis pathway leading to a decrease in inositol levels (13Agam G. Shamir A. Shaltiel G. Greenberg M.L.

Inositol depletion decreases components of the inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate (InsP3)/Ca2+ signaling pathway, which decreases Ca2+ release from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). A decrease in InsP3/Ca2+ signaling may counteract the increased neuronal excitatory drive of both the excitatory and inhibitory neurons responsible for the onset of BD (10Berridge M.J. Calcium signalling and psychiatric disease: Bipolar disorder and schizophrenia.Cell Tissue Res. 2014; 357: 477-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Interestingly, inhibition of inositol monophosphatase (IMPase), a target of lithium, has been shown to stimulate the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) through decreased InsP3 signaling, leading to a decrease in ER release and subsequent mitochondrial uptake of Ca2+ (17Cardenas C.

VPA was shown to activate AMPK in mouse and human primary hepatocytes by unknown mechanisms (18Avery L.B. Bumpus N.N.

AMPK also upregulates the transcription of PGC-1α (peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ coactivator 1α), the master regulator of mitochondrial biogenesis (20Bergeron R. Ren J.M. Cadman K.S.

Signal. 2017; 10Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). As mitochondrial dysfunction has been implicated in the pathophysiology of BD (24Stork C. Renshaw P.F. Mitochondrial dysfunction in bipolar disorder: Evidence from magnetic resonance spectroscopy research.Mol. Psychiatry. 2005; 10: 900-919Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar), increased macroautophagy and mitochondrial biogenesis through AMPK activation may contribute to the therapeutic mechanism of mood stabilizing drugs (11Case K.C. Salsaa M. Yu W. Greenberg M.L. Regulation of inositol biosynthesis: Balancing health and pathophysiology.Handb. Exp. Pharmacol. 2020; 259: 221-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). In addition, AMPK-mediated phosphorylation of the GABAB receptors suppresses neuronal excitation and promotes neuronal survival (25Hardie D.G. Frenguelli B.G.

Therefore, activation of AMPK may link inositol depletion and GABA potentiation as a potential mechanism of action of mood stabilizers. Understanding how AMPK is activated by mood stabilizers may provide important insight into the therapeutic mechanism of action of the drug. AMPK is highly conserved in eukaryotes. Snf1, the Saccharomyces cerevisiae homolog of AMPK and a founding member of the SNF1/AMPK family, was identified genetically in 1981, more than a decade before discovery of the mammalian homolog (27Hedbacker K. Carlson M. SNF1/AMPK pathways in yeast.Front. Biosci. 2008; 13: 2408-2420Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). Cross-species functionality has been demonstrated from yeast to mammalian cells, and the yeast model has been pivotal in identifying mammalian upstream activating kinases (27Hedbacker K. Carlson M. SNF1/AMPK pathways in yeast.Front. Biosci. 2008; 13: 2408-2420Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). Interestingly, a microarray analysis conducted to identify pathways affected by VPA in yeast revealed a pattern of altered expression of metabolic genes that is similar to the pattern observed during Snf1 activation (28Jadhav S. Russo S. Cowart L.A. Greenberg M.L. Inositol depletion induced by acute treatment of the bipolar disorder drug valproate increases levels of phytosphingosine.J. Biol. Chem. 2017; 292: 4953-4959Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar, 29Young E.T. Dombek K.M. Tachibana C. Ideker T.

Chem. 2003; 278: 26146-26158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). In the current study, we further exploited the yeast model to gain insight into the mechanism of activation of SNF1/AMPK by VPA. Snf1, the yeast homolog of AMPK, is activated by phosphorylation of Thr210 by one of three redundant kinases, Sak1, Elm1, and Tos3 (30Sutherland C.M. Hawley S.A. McCartney R.R. Leech A. Stark M.J.

Biol. 2003; 13: 1299-1305Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). Upon activation, Snf1 regulates the activity of several transcription factors that mediate derepression of glucose-repressed genes, β-oxidation, the carnitine shuttle, the glyoxylate cycle, and gluconeogenesis (29Young E.T. Dombek K.M. Tachibana C. Ideker T. Multiple pathways are co-regulated by the protein kinase Snf1 and the transcription factors Adr1 and Cat8.J. Biol.

Oliveira A.P. Yates 3rd, J.R. Olsson L. Nielsen J. Reconstruction of the yeast Snf1 kinase regulatory network reveals its role as a global energy regulator.Mol. Syst. Biol. 2009; 5: 319Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). This occurs in wild-type cells when glucose is depleted during the diauxic shift (33Galdieri L. Mehrotra S. Yu S. Vancura A. Transcriptional regulation in yeast during diauxic shift and stationary phase.OMICS. 2010; 14: 629-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). In addition to carbon stress, Snf1 is activated in response to other environmental stressors, even in the presence of glucose (34Hong S.P. Carlson M. Regulation of snf1 protein kinase in response to environmental stress.J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 16838-16845Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the microarray study cited above was conducted in conditions of high glucose when Snf1 is not usually activated (28Jadhav S. Russo S. Cowart L.A. Greenberg M.L. Inositol depletion induced by acute treatment of the bipolar disorder drug valproate increases levels of phytosphingosine.J. Biol. Chem. 2017; 292: 4953-4959Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar), suggesting that VPA treatment substantially impacts energy metabolism. One of the main downstream targets of Snf1 is the transcriptional repressor Mig1 (35Papamichos-Chronakis M. Gligoris T. Tzamarias D. The Snf1 kinase controls glucose repression in yeast by modulating interactions between the Mig1 repressor and the Cyc8-Tup1 co-repressor.EMBO Rep. 2004; 5: 368-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Upon carbon stress, Snf1 phosphorylates Mig1 leading to its nuclear export, which results in increased expression of many genes required for the use of other carbon sources, such as SUC2 (36Treitel M.A. Kuchin S. Carlson M. Snf1 protein kinase regulates phosphorylation of the Mig1 repressor in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6273-6280Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). While Snf1 may get activated under high-glucose conditions, it phosphorylates Mig1 only under glucose limitation. This suggests that glucose depletion regulates the Snf1-Mig1 pathway via two independent steps; activation of Snf1, followed by translocation of active Snf1 to the nucleus where Mig1 inactivation occurs (37Garcia-Salcedo R. Lubitz T. Beltran G. Elbing K. Tian Y. Frey S. Wolkenhauer O. Krantz M. Klipp E. Hohmann S. Glucose de-repression by yeast AMP-activated protein kinase SNF1 is controlled via at least two independent steps.FEBS J. 2014; 281: 1901-1917Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). In yeast, glycolysis is the primary metabolic pathway utilized to generate energy when glucose is present, a phenomenon known as the Crabtree effect (38De Deken R.H. The Crabtree effect: A regulatory system in yeast.J. Gen. Microbiol. 1966; 44: 149-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (550) Google Scholar). ATP produced through glycolysis serves as a critical energy source, with as much as 50% being used to fuel Pma1, the proton pump in the plasma membrane that maintains the cytosolic pH (pHc) (39Kjellerup L. Gordon S. Cohrt K.O. Brown W.D. Fuglsang A.T. Winther A.L. Identification of antifungal H(+)-ATPase inhibitors with effect on plasma membrane potential.Antimicrob.

Regulation of glycolytic oscillations by mitochondrial and plasma membrane H+-ATPases.Biophys. J. 2009; 96: 3850-3861Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Glycolytic activity itself is highly sensitive to pHc. Reductions in pHc can inhibit at least two glycolytic enzymes, and this has been hypothesized to underlie the antimicrobial effects of some weak-acid food preservatives (41Stratford M. Nebe-von-Caron G. Steels H. Novodvorska M. Ueckert J. Archer D.B. Weak-acid preservatives: pH and proton movements in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae.Int. J.

Studies on the mechanism of the antifungal action of benzoate.Biochem. J. 1983; 214: 657-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). In addition to the cellular effects of VPA discussed above, its chemistry as a weak acid predicts that it directly lowers the pHc, resulting in concomitant changes in energy metabolism. Here, we report that VPA activates Snf1 even during glucose-replete conditions by a novel pH-dependent mechanism. VPA decreased the pHc and inhibited proton efflux, consistent with decreased activity of the plasma membrane proton pump Pma1. Snf1 activation could be recapitulated by direct inhibition of Pma1 with omeprazole, which decreases the pHc. These findings support a novel mechanism of Snf1 activation by VPA mediated through decreasing the pHc. A previously reported microarray analysis of the yeast gene expression response to VPA suggested altered expression of metabolic genes (28Jadhav S. Russo S. Cowart L.A. Greenberg M.L. Inositol depletion induced by acute treatment of the bipolar disorder drug valproate increases levels of phytosphingosine.J. Biol. Chem. 2017; 292: 4953-4959Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). qPCR analysis indicated no change in SUC2 (invertase; sucrose metabolism) expression and increased expression of POX1 (fatty-acyl CoA oxidase; β-oxidation), CIT2 and MLS1 (citrate synthase 2 and malate synthase; glyoxylate cycle), PCK1 (phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase; gluconeogenesis), and CAT2 (carnitine acetyl-CoA transferase; carnitine shuttle) in response to VPA treatment (1 mM, 30 min) (Fig. 1). This gene expression profile is similar to the pattern observed following Snf1 activation (29Young E.T. Dombek K.M. Tachibana C. Ideker T. Multiple pathways are co-regulated by the protein kinase Snf1 and the transcription factors Adr1 and Cat8.J. Biol.

Lubitz T. Beltran G. Elbing K. Tian Y. Frey S. Wolkenhauer O. Krantz M. Klipp E. Hohmann S. Glucose de-repression by yeast AMP-activated protein kinase SNF1 is controlled via at least two independent steps.FEBS J. 2014; 281: 1901-1917Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Therefore, we assayed Snf1 activation by determining levels of Thr210-phosphorylated Snf1 (44Orlova M. Barrett L. Kuchin S. Detection of endogenous Snf1 and its activation state: Application to Saccharomyces and Candida species.Yeast. 2008; 25: 745-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Western blot analysis revealed that VPA increased levels of activated (phosphorylated) Snf1 (Fig. 2).Figure 2VPA activates Snf1. Cells cultured in I− medium containing high glucose (2%) until the mid-log phase were either treated with or without VPA (1 mM) for 30 min or switched to low glucose (0.05%) for 1 h (L). Parallel samples were loaded on two separate gels and levels of phosphorylated and endogenous Snf1 were determined by Western blot analysis. Both membranes were incubated with anti-tubulin antibody (Tub) to normalize for protein loading. Values indicate the relative intensity of phosphorylated Snf1 normalized to tubulin divided by that of total Snf1 protein normalized to tubulin.

Inhibition of IMPase, which decreases inositol levels (14Berridge M.J. Downes C.P. Hanley M.R. Lithium amplifies agonist-dependent phosphatidylinositol responses in brain and salivary glands.Biochem.

Yang J. Parker I. Thompson C.B. Birnbaum M.J. Hallows K.R. Foskett J.K. Essential regulation of cell bioenergetics by constitutive InsP3 receptor Ca2+ transfer to mitochondria.Cell. 2010; 142: 270-283Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (732) Google Scholar). To explore the possibility that inositol depletion activates Snf1, we utilized the ino1Δ mutant, which cannot synthesize inositol and undergoes “inositol-less death” after two doublings (46Henry S.A. Donahue T.F. Culbertson M.R. Selection of spontaneous mutants by inositol starvation in yeast.Mol. Gen. Genet. 1975; 143: 5-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Shifting ino1Δ mutant cells to medium without inositol (I−) for 4 h increased Snf1 phosphorylation (Fig. 3). Snf1 phosphorylation was not increased in wild-type cells, which can synthesize inositol in I− medium. These findings indicate that inositol depletion activates Snf1. To determine if the mechanism of Snf1 activation by VPA is mediated by decreased inositol levels, wild-type cells were treated with VPA in the presence or absence of inositol for 4 h. VPA increased Snf1 phosphorylation in the presence or absence of inositol (Fig. 4), demonstrating that activation of Snf1 by VPA is independent of inositol levels.Figure 4VPA activates Snf1 in the presence of inositol. WT cells were cultured in the presence or absence of inositol until mid-log phase and treated with VPA (1 mM) for 4 h or switched to low glucose (0.05%) for 1 h (L). Parallel samples were loaded on two separate gels. Both membranes were incubated with anti-tubulin antibody (Tub) to normalize for protein loading.

Sodium valproate induces mitochondrial respiration dysfunction in HepG2 in vitro cell model.Toxicology. 2015; 331: 47-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). More recently, we reported that VPA directly inhibits cytochrome c oxidase (COX) (8Salsaa M. Pereira B. Liu J. Yu W. Jadhav S. Huttemann M. Greenberg M.L. Valproate inhibits mitochondrial bioenergetics and increases glycolysis in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.Sci. Rep. 2020; 10: 11785Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar), the last and rate limiting enzyme of the electron transport chain. Inhibition of COX decreases mitochondrial bioenergetics and ATP levels and activates AMPK (47Benziane B. Bjornholm M. Pirkmajer S. Austin R.L. Kotova O. Viollet B. Zierath J.R. Chibalin A.V. Activation of AMP-activated protein kinase stimulates Na+,K+-ATPase activity in skeletal muscle cells.J. Biol. Chem. 2012; 287: 23451-23463Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). To test if VPA activates Snf1 through inhibition of COX, cells were treated with the COX inhibitor potassium cyanide (0.2 mM) for 30 min. Unlike VPA, potassium cyanide did not activate Snf1 when cells were grown in high glucose (data not shown). This is consistent with a previous finding that antimycin A, a specific inhibitor of complex III, did not activate Snf1 when cells were grown in high glucose (34Hong S.P. Carlson M. Regulation of snf1 protein kinase in response to environmental stress.J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 16838-16845Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Taken together, these results indicate that VPA activates Snf1 through a mechanism independent of inositol or COX inhibition. The primary function of SNF1/AMPK is to conserve cellular energy and increase ATP levels (48Herzig S. Shaw R.J. AMPK: Guardian of metabolism and mitochondrial homeostasis.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2018; 19: 121-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (1223) Google Scholar). In mammalian cells, AMPK is directly activated by AMP when the AMP/ATP ratio increases (49Hardie D.G. Carling D. The AMP-activated protein kinase--fuel gauge of the mammalian cell?.Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 246: 259-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (1117) Google Scholar). Unlike AMPK, Snf1 is not directly activated by AMP, but it has been suggested that Snf1 may be activated by elevated ADP levels (50Mayer F.V. Heath R. Underwood E. Sanders M.J. Carmena D. McCartney R.R. Leiper F.C. Xiao B. Jing C. Walker P.A. Haire L.F. Ogrodowicz R. Martin S.R. Schmidt M.C.

Therefore, we addressed the possibility that VPA treatment activates Snf1 as a result of increased ATP hydrolysis. Surprisingly, we observed that VPA treatment resulted in an approximate doubling of ATP levels after 30 min (Fig. 5). A possible explanation for increased ATP levels is that VPA inhibits cellular processes that consume ATP. The plasma membrane H+-ATPase pump, Pma1, is a major consumer of cellular ATP in yeast, where it functions to maintain the cytosolic pH by actively pumping H+ out of the cell (51Serrano R.

https://openalex.org/W3092117201,"Gaussian processes offer a flexible kernel method for regression. While Gaussian processes have many useful theoretical properties and have proven practically useful, they suffer from poor scaling in the number of observations. In particular, the cubic time complexity of updating standard Gaussian process models can be a limiting factor in applications. We propose an algorithm for sequentially partitioning the input space and fitting a localized Gaussian process to each disjoint region. The algorithm is shown to have superior time and space complexity to existing methods, and its sequential nature allows the model to be updated efficiently. The algorithm constructs a model for which the time complexity of updating is tightly bounded above by a pre-specified parameter. To the best of our knowledge, the model is the first local Gaussian process regression model to achieve linear memory complexity. Theoretical continuity properties of the model are proven. We demonstrate the efficacy of the resulting model on several multi-dimensional regression tasks."

During an ongoing survey of bambusicolous fungi in southwest China, we collected a submerged decaying branch of bamboo from Sichuan Province, China and an Ophioceras species occurring on this substrate was observed and isolated. An Ophioceras taxon was delimited based on morphological characteristics and combined LSU, RPB1 and ITS sequence analyses and is described as Ophioceras sichuanense sp. nov. The species formed a well-supported clade basal to Ophioceras (100% ML, 1.00 PP). Based on the updated phylogenetic tree of Magnaporthales, Ceratosphaerella castillensis (generic type) and C . rhizomorpha formed a clade within Ophioceras and morphologically resemble Ophioceras . Therefore, Ceratosphaerella is synonymized under Ophioceras . The phylogenetic relationships of Ophioceras are discussed in relation to morphological similarities of genera in Magnaporthales. The generic circumscription of Ophioceras is emended."
https://openalex.org/W3194083452,"Introduction Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is estimated to affect 10 million people annually, making it a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. One cost-effective intervention that has been shown to minimize some of the negative sequelae after TBI is peer support. However, the evidence supporting the benefits of peer support for individuals with TBI is sparse and of low quality. Integrated knowledge translation (iKT) may be one approach to optimizing the evaluation of peer support programs among individuals with TBI. Therefore, the objectives are: (1) To understand key informants’ perspectives of the barriers and facilitators of participating in peer support research and programs among individuals with TBI; (2) to understand key informants’ perspectives on the perceived impacts of peer support programs on individuals with TBI; and, (3) to demonstrate how an iKT approach can inform the development and implementation of a pilot feasibility randomized controlled trial (RCT). Methods A qualitative descriptive approach using one-on-one semi-structured interviews was used. Purposive sampling of 22 key informants included 8 peer support mentors, 4 individuals with TBI who received peer support, 3 caregivers of individuals with TBI, 4 peer support program staff, and 3 academics in peer support and/or TBI. Results There were five main themes related to the barriers and facilitators to participating in peer support research and programs: knowledge, awareness, and communication; logistics of participating; readiness and motivation to participate; need for clear expectations; and matching. There were three main themes related to the perceived impact of peer support: acceptance, community, social experiences; vicarious experience/learning through others: shared experiences, role-modelling, encouragement; and “I feel better.” Discussions with our Research Partner led to several significant adaptations to our trial protocol, including removing the twice/week intervention arm, shortening of the length of trial, and changing the measure for the community integration outcome. Discussion/Conclusion This is the first study to use an iKT approach to inform a trial protocol and the first to assess the barriers and facilitators to participating in peer support research."
https://openalex.org/W3194611056,"The family Arecaceae is distributed throughout tropical and subtropical regions of the world. Among the five subfamilies, Arecoideae is the most species-rich and still contains some ambiguous inter-generic relationships, such as those within subtribes Attaleinae and Bactridineae. The hypervariable regions of plastid genomes (plastomes) are interesting tools to clarify unresolved phylogenetic relationships. We sequenced and characterized the plastome of Bactris gasipaes (Bactridinae) and compared it with eight species from the three Cocoseae sub-tribes (Attaleinae, Bactridinae, and Elaeidinae) to perform comparative analysis and to identify hypervariable regions. The Bactris gasipaes plastome has 156,646 bp, with 113 unique genes. Among them, four genes have an alternative start codon ( cemA , rps19 , rpl2 , and ndhD ). Plastomes are highly conserved within tribe Cocoseae: 97.3% identity, length variation of ~2 kb, and a single ~4.5 kb inversion in Astrocaryum plastomes. The LSC/IR and IR/SSC junctions vary among the subtribes: in Bactridinae and Elaeidinae the rps19 gene is completely contained in the IR region; in the subtribe Attaleinae the rps19 gene is only partially contained in the IRs. The hypervariable regions selected according to sequence variation (SV%) and frequency of parsimony informative sites (PIS%) revealed plastome regions with great potential for molecular analysis. The ten regions with greatest SV% showed higher variation than the plastid molecular markers commonly used for phylogenetic analysis in palms. The phylogenetic trees based on the plastomes and the hypervariable regions (SV%) datasets had well-resolved relationships, with consistent topologies within tribe Cocoseae, and confirm the monophyly of the subtribes Bactridinae and Attaleinae."
https://openalex.org/W3193287305,"Adverse health outcomes of ionizing radiation given chronically at low dose rates are highly debated, a controversy also relevant for other stressors. Increased knowledge is needed for a more comprehensive understanding of the damaging potential of ionizing radiation from all dose rates and doses. There is a lack of relevant low dose rate data that is partly ascribed to the rarity of exposure facilities allowing chronic low dose rate exposures. Using the FIGARO facility, we assessed early (one day post-radiation) and late (recovery time of 100–200 days) hepatic genome-wide transcriptional profiles in male mice of two strains (CBA/CaOlaHsd and C57BL/6NHsd) exposed chronically to a low dose rate (2.5 mGy/h; 1200h, LDR), a mid-dose rate (10 mGy/h; 300h, MDR) and acutely to a high dose rate (100 mGy/h; 30h, HDR) of gamma irradiation, given to an equivalent total dose of 3 Gy. Dose-rate and strain-specific transcriptional responses were identified. Differently modulated transcriptional responses across all dose rate exposure groups were evident by the representation of functional biological pathways. Evidence of changed epigenetic regulation (global DNA methylation) was not detected. A period of recovery markedly reduced the number of differentially expressed genes. Using enrichment analysis to identify the functional significance of the modulated genes, perturbed signaling pathways associated with both cancer and non-cancer effects were observed, such as lipid metabolism and inflammation. These pathways were seen after chronic low dose rate and were not restricted to the acute high dose rate exposure. The transcriptional response induced by chronic low dose rate ionizing radiation suggests contribution to conditions such as cardiovascular diseases. We contribute with novel genome wide transcriptional data highlighting dose-rate-specific radiation responses and emphasize the importance of considering both dose rate, duration of exposure, and variability in susceptibility when assessing risks from ionizing radiation."
https://openalex.org/W3195020778,"Background and aims Fibrosis progression is the most important prognostic factor, and insulin resistance is one of the main mechanisms associated with fibrosis progression in patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). We evaluate the association between baseline insulin resistance and future fibrosis progression in patients with NAFLD without diabetes. Approach and results This retrospective longitudinal study with 8-year follow-up period included 32,606 (men, 83%) participants aged &gt;20 years (average age, 38.0 years) without diabetes at baseline who completed at least two comprehensive health checkups from January 1, 2010 to December 31, 2018. NAFLD was diagnosed based on ultrasonography. The homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) was used to evaluate baseline insulin resistance. Fibrosis progression was assessed using the aspartate aminotransferase to platelet ratio index (APRI). The advanced liver fibrosis with an APRI value above the intermediate fibrosis probability (≥0.5) developed in a total of 2,897 participants during 136,108 person-years. 114 participants progressed to a high fibrosis probability stage (APRI &gt;1.5) during 141,064 person-years. Using the lowest baseline HOMA-IR quartile group (Q1) as a reference, the multivariate-adjusted hazard ratio (HR) for development of advanced liver fibrosis (APRI ≥0.5) in the highest baseline HOMA-IR quartile group (Q4) was 1.95 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.74–2.19; Model 4). And the HR for development of advanced liver fibrosis with high fibrosis probability was 1.95 (95% CI 1.10–3.46; Model 4). The positive association was maintained throughout the entire follow-up period. The baseline HOMA-IR model was superior to the baseline body mass index (BMI) model in predicting the progression of fibrosis probability. Conclusions In this longitudinal study, we found that the degree of baseline insulin resistance, assessed by HOMA-IR values, was positively associated with future fibrosis progression in patients with NAFLD without diabetes."
https://openalex.org/W3195584969,"Nudges have repeatedly been found to be effective, however they are claimed to harm autonomy, and it has been found that laypeople expect this too. To test whether these expectations translate to actual harm to experienced autonomy, three online studies were conducted. The paradigm used in all studies was that participants were asked to voluntarily participate in a longer version of the questionnaire. This was either done in a hypothetical setting, where participants imagined they were asked this question, but did not answer it, and reported their expectations for autonomy; Or in an actual choice setting where participants answered the question and then reported their actual autonomy. The first study utilized the hypothetical setting and tried to replicate that laypeople expect nudges to harm autonomy with the current paradigm. A total of 451 participants were randomly assigned to either a control, a default nudge, or a social norm nudge condition. In the default nudge condition, the affirmative answer was pre-selected, and in the social norm nudge condition it was stated that most people answered affirmative. The results showed a trend for lower expected autonomy in nudge conditions, but did not find significant evidence. In Study 2, with a sample size of 454, the same design was used in an actual choice setting. Only the default nudge was found to be effective, and no difference in autonomy was found. In Study 3, Studies 1 and 2 were replicated. Explanation of the nudge was added as an independent variable and the social norm nudge condition was dropped, resulting in six conditions and 1322 participants. The results showed that participants indeed expected default nudges to harm their autonomy, but only if the nudge was explained. When actually nudged, no effect on autonomy was found, independent of the presence of an explanation."
https://openalex.org/W3196150997,"Calcium (Ca2+) is an essential nutrient element for plants as it stabilizes the membrane system structure and controls enzyme activity. To investigate the effects of Ca2+ on plant growth and leaf photosynthetic electron transport in oat (Avena sativa) under NaCl stress, oat seeds and plants were cultivated in nutrient solutions with single NaCl treatment and NaCl treatment with CaCl2 amendment. By measuring the seed germination rate, plant growth, Na+ and Cl- accumulation in leaves, ion leakage in seedlings and leaves, prompt chlorophyll a fluorescence (PF) transient (OJIP), delayed chlorophyll a fluorescence (DF), and modulated 820 nm reflection (MR) values of the leaves at different growth phases, we observed that Ca2+ alleviated the inhibition of germination and plant growth and decreased Na+ and Cl- accumulation and ion leakage in the leaves under NaCl stress. NaCl stress changed the curves of the OJIP transient, induced PF intensity at P-step (FP) decrease and PF intensity at J-step (FJ) increase, resulted in obvious K and L bands, and altered the performance index of absorption (PIABS), the absorption of antenna chlorophyll (ABS/RC), electron movement efficiency (ETo/TRo), and potential maximum photosynthetic capacity (FV/FM) values. With the time extension of NaCl stress, I1 and I2 in the DF curve showed a decreasing trend, the lowest values of MR/MRO curve increased, and the highest points of the MR/MRO curve decreased. Compared with NaCl treatment, the extent of change induced by NaCl in the values of OJIP, DF and MR was reduced in the NaCl treatment with CaCl2 amendment. These results revealed that Ca2+ might improve the photosynthetic efficiency and the growth of salt-stressed plants by maintaining the integrity of oxygen-evolving complexes and electron transporters on the side of the PSI receptor and enhancing the relationship between the functional units of the photosynthetic electron transport chain. The findings from this study could be used for improving crop productivity in saline alkali lands."
https://openalex.org/W3113305893,"In this paper, we present a new method for detecting overlapping communities in networks with a predefined number of clusters called LPAM (Link Partitioning Around Medoids). The overlapping communities in the graph are obtained by detecting the disjoint communities in the associated line graph employing link partitioning and partitioning around medoids which are done through the use of a distance function defined on the set of nodes. We consider both the commute distance and amplified commute distance as distance functions. The performance of the LPAM method is evaluated with computational experiments on real life instances, as well as synthetic network benchmarks. For small and medium-size networks, the exact solution was found, while for large networks we found solutions with a heuristic version of the LPAM method."
https://openalex.org/W3161613445,"Using an incentivized experiment with statistical power, this paper explores the role of stakes in charitable giving of lottery prizes, where subjects commit to donate a fraction of the prize before they learn the outcome of the lottery. We study three stake levels: 5€ ( n = 177), 100€ ( n = 168), and 1,000€ ( n = 171). Although the donations increase in absolute terms as the stakes increase, subjects decrease the donated fraction of the pie. However, people still share roughly 20% of 1,000€, an amount as high as the average monthly salary of people at the age of our subjects. The number of people sharing 50% of the pie is remarkably stable across stakes, but donating the the whole pie–the modal behavior in charity-donation experiments–disappears with stakes. Such hyper-altruistic behavior thus seems to be an artifact of the stakes typically employed in economic and psychological experiments. Our findings point out that sharing with others is a prevalent human feature, but stakes are an important determinant of sharing. Policies promoted via prosocial frames (e.g., stressing the effects of mask-wearing or social distancing on others during the Covid-19 pandemic or environmentally-friendly behaviors on future generations) may thus be miscalibrated if they disregard the stakes at play."
https://openalex.org/W3193626335,"Objective The purpose of the study is to analyses the relationship between interoceptive sensibility and somatoform disorders among persons with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). It has been assumed that the interoceptive sensibility is accompanied by a high level of alexithymia and emotion dysregulation in somatoform disorders. Methods Persons under the care of the foundation helping people with ASD were asked to participate in the study. In total, 205 people took part in the research. The participants aged from 18 to 63 (M = 34.91; SD = 8.44). The ASD group comprised 79 persons (38.5% of subjects). The control group comprised 126 individuals (61.5% of subjects). Participants completed self-report questionnaires measuring autism (AQ), interoceptive sensibility (BPQ), alexithymia (TAS20), emotional dysregulation (DERS), and somatoform disorder (SDQ). Results The analyses showed a moderation effect of the group, which indicates the existence of a relationship between interoceptive sensibility and somatoform disorders to the greater extent in the clinical group than in the control group. In addition, the serial multiple mediation model analysis allowed to verify the mediating effect of emotion dysregulation and alexithymia on the abovementioned relationship. The indirect effect, which assumed the mediating role of alexithymia turned out to be significant, contrary to the indirect effect where emotion dysregulation was a mediator in a situation where both variables were applied simultaneously. Conclusions Interoceptive sensibility correlated with level of alexithymia, in particular, difficulties in identifying and verbalizing emotions and emotion dysregulation in the lack of emotional awareness and lack of emotional clarity and is associated with somatoform disorders in the investigated group regardless of participants’ belonging to the ASD or control group."
https://openalex.org/W3193822549,"Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a clinically common arrhythmia that affects human health. Myocardial fibrosis serves as an important contributor to AF. Recently, miRNA-1202 have been reported to be up-regulated in AF. However, the role of miRNA-1202 and its mechanism in myocardial fibrosis remain unclear.Human cardiac fibroblasts (HCFs) were used to construct a fibrosis model by TGF-β1 induction. The expression of miR-1202 was measured by qRT-PCR. Cell proliferation was assessed by CCK-8 assays. Protein expression levels were measured by western blot. Collagen accumulation was measured by ELISA. The relationship between miR-1202 and nNOS was investigated by luciferase reporter assays.MiR-1202 expression was obviously increased in HCFs and was both time- and dose-independent. MiR-1202 could increase the proliferation and collagen I, collagen III, and α-SMA levels with or without TGF-β1. MiR-1202 could also increase TGF-β1 and p-Smad2/3 protein levels in comparison to the control group. However, they were obviously decreased after inhibitor transfection. MiR-1202 targets nNOS for negative regulation of HCFs fibrosis by decreasing cell differentiation, collagen deposition and the activity of the TGF-β1/Smad2/3 pathway. Co-transfection of miR-1202 inhibitor and siRNA of nNOS inhibited nNOS protein expression, thereby enhancing the HCFs proliferation. Furthermore, co-transfection of the miR-1202 inhibitor and siRNA of nNOS significantly promoted collagen I, collagen III, TGF-β1, Smad2/3 and α-SMA protein expression and Smad2/3 protein phosphorylation. These findings suggested that miR-1202 promotes HCFs transformation to a pro-fibrotic phenotype by targeting nNOS through activating the TGF-β1/Smad2/3 pathway."
https://openalex.org/W3194077084,"Urbanization and subsequent expansion of wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) capacity has the potential to alter stream metabolic regimes, but the magnitude of this change remains unknown. Indeed, our understanding of downstream WWTP effects on stream metabolism is spatially and temporally limited, and monitoring designs with upstream-downstream comparison sites are rare. Despite this, and despite observed spatiotemporal variability in stream metabolic regimes, regulators typically use snapshot monitoring to assess ecosystem function in receiving streams, potentially leading to biased conclusions about stream health. To address these important practical issues, we assessed the spatiotemporal variability in stream metabolism at nine sites upstream and downstream of four WWTPs in a suburban stream. We used one year (2017-2018) of high-frequency dissolved oxygen (DO) data to model daily gross primary productivity (GPP) and ecosystem respiration (ER). We found that GPP was 1.7-4.0 times higher and ER was 1.2-7.2 times higher downstream of the WWTPs, especially in spring when light was not limited by canopy shading. Critically, we observed that these effects were spatially limited to the kilometer or so just downstream of the plant. These effects were also temporally limited, and metabolic rates upstream of WWTPs were not different from sites downstream of the plant after leaf-out at some sites. Across sites, regardless of their relation to WWTPs, GPP was positively correlated with potential incident light suggesting that light is the dominant control on GPP in this system. Temporal windowing of DO to proposed regulatory monitoring lengths revealed that the violation frequency of water quality criteria depended on both the monitoring interval and start date. We conclude that spatiotemporal variability in metabolism and DO are crucial considerations when developing monitoring programs to assess ecosystem function, and that evidence of WWTP effects may only arise during high light conditions and at limited scales."
https://openalex.org/W3194255700,"Chili pepper (Capsicum annuum) is one of the most important crops worldwide. Its fruits contain metabolites produced over the maturation process like capsaicinoids and carotenoids. This metabolic process produces internal changes in flavor, color, texture, and aroma in fruits to make them more attractive for seed dispersal organisms. The chiltepin (C. annuum L. var. glabriusculum) is a wild variety of the C. annuum L. species that is considered a source of genetic resources that could be used to improve the current chili crops. In this study, we performed a transcriptomic analysis on two fruit maturation stages: immature stage (green fruit) and mature stage (red fruit) of a wild and a cultivated pepper variety. We found 19,811 genes expressed, and 1,008 genes differentially expressed (DEGs) in at least one of the five contrast used; 730 DEGs were found only in one contrast, and most DEGs in all contrasts were downregulated. GO enrichment analysis showed that the majority of DEGs are related to stress responses. KEGG enrichment analysis detected differences in expression patterns in metabolic pathways related to phenylpropanoid biosynthesis, secondary metabolites, plant hormone signal transduction, carotenoid biosynthesis and sesquiterpenoid and triterpenoid biosynthesis. We selected 105 tomato fruit ripening-related genes, and found 53 pepper homologs differentially expressed related to shape, size, and secondary metabolite biosynthesis. According to the transcriptome analysis, the two peppers showed very similar gene expression patterns; differences in expression patterns of genes related to shape, size, ethylene and secondary metabolites biosynthesis suggest that changes produced by domestication of chilli pepper could be very specific to the expression of genes related to traits desired in commercial fruits."
https://openalex.org/W3194316636,"Since 2008, the Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR) has mandated that studies it funds either in whole or in part are required to publish their results as open access (OA) within 12 months of publication using either online repositories and/or OA journals. Yet, there is evidence that authors are poorly compliant with this mandate. Specifically, there has been an apparent decrease in OA publication after 2015, which coincides with a change in the OA policy during the same year. One particular policy change that may have contributed to this decline was lifting the requirement that authors deposit their article in an OA repository immediately upon publication. We investigated the proportion of OA compliance of CIHR-funded studies in the period before and after the policy change of 2015 with manual confirmation of both CIHR funding and OA status.We identified CIHR-funded studies published between the years 2014 to 2017 using a comprehensive search in the Web of Science (WoS). We took a stratified random sample from all four years (i.e. 2014 to 2017), with 250 studies from each year. Two authors independently reviewed the final full-text publications retrieved from the journal web page to determine to confirm CIHR funding, as indicated in the acknowledgements or elsewhere in the paper. For each study, we also collected bibliometric data that included citation count and Altmetric attention score Statistical analyses were conducted using two-tailed Fisher's exact test with relative risk (RR). Among the 851 receiving CIHR funding published from 2014 to 2017, the percentage of CIHR-funded studies published as OA significantly decreased from 79.6% in 2014 to 70.3% in 2017 (RR = 0.88, 95% CI: 0.79-0.99, P = 0.028). When considering all four years, there was no significant difference in the percentage of CIHR-funded studies published as OA in both 2014 and 2015 compared to both 2016 and 2017 (RR = 0.97, 95% CI: 0.90-1.05, P = 0.493). Additionally, OA publications had significantly higher citation count (both in year of publication and in total) and higher attention scores (P<0.05).Overall, we found that there was a significant decrease in the proportion of CIHR funded studies published as OA from 2014 compared to 2017, though this difference did not persist when comparing both 2014-2015 to 2016-2017. The primary limitation was the reliance of self-reported data from authors on CIHR funding status. We posit that this decrease may be attributable to CIHR's OA policy change in 2015. Further exploration is warranted to both validate these studies using a larger dataset and, if valid, investigate the effects of potential interventions to improve the OA compliance, such as use of a CIHR publication database, and reinstatement of a policy for authors to immediately submit their findings to OA repositories upon publication."
https://openalex.org/W3194375668,"Social scientists identify two core functions of modern welfare states as redistribution across (a) socio-economic status groups (Robin Hood) and (b) 'the lifecycle' (the piggy bank). But what is the relative importance of these functions? The answer has been elusive, as the piggy bank is metaphorical. The intra-personal time-travel of resources it implies is based on non-quid-pro-quo transfers. In practice, 'lifecycle redistribution' must operate through inter-age-group resource reallocation in cross-section. Since at any time different birth cohorts live together, 'resource-productive' working-aged people are taxed to finance consumption of 'resource-dependent' younger and older people. In a novel decomposition analysis, we study the joint distribution of socio-economic status, age, and respectively (a) all cash and in-kind transfers ('benefits'), (b) financing contributions ('taxes'), and (c) resulting 'net benefits,' on a sample of over 400,000 Europeans from 22 EU countries. European welfare states, often maligned as ineffective Robin Hood vehicles riddled with Matthew effects, are better characterized as inter-age redistribution machines performing a more important second task rather well: lifecycle consumption smoothing. Social policies serve multiple goals in Europe, but empirically they are neither primarily nor solely responsible for poverty relief and inequality reduction."
https://openalex.org/W3194221011,"Some communities recover more quickly after a disaster than others. Some differentials in recovery are explained by variation in the level of disaster-related community damage and differences in pre-disaster community characteristics, e.g., the quality of housing stock. But distinct communities that are similar on the above characteristics may experience different recovery trajectories, and, if so, these different trajectories must be due to more subtle differences among them. Our principal objective is to assess short-term and long-term post-disaster mental health for Vietnamese and African Americans living in two adjacent communities in eastern New Orleans that were similarly flooded by Hurricane Katrina. We employ data from two population-based cohort studies that include a sample of African American adults (the Gulf Coast Child and Family Health [GCAFH study]) and a sample of Vietnamese American adults (Katrina Impacts on Vietnamese Americans [KATIVA NOLA study]) living in adjacent neighborhoods in eastern New Orleans who were assessed near the second and thirteenth anniversaries of the disaster. Using the 12-Item Short Form Survey (SF-12) as the basis of our outcome measure, we find in multivariate analysis a significant advantage in post-disaster mental health for Vietnamese Americans over their African American counterparts at the two-year mark, but that this advantage had disappeared by the thirteenth anniversary of the Katrina disaster."
https://openalex.org/W3194482552,"The cancer stem cell (CSC) concept proposes that cancer recurrence and metastasis are driven by CSCs. In this study, we investigated whether cells from colon adenocarcinoma (CA) with a CSC-like phenotype express renin-angiotensin system (RAS) components, and the effect of RAS inhibitors on CA-derived primary cell lines. Expression of RAS components was interrogated using immunohistochemical and immunofluorescence staining in 6 low-grade CA (LGCA) and 6 high-grade CA (HGCA) tissue samples and patient-matched normal colon samples. Primary cell lines derived from 4 HGCA tissues were treated with RAS inhibitors to investigate their effect on cellular metabolism, tumorsphere formation and transcription of pluripotency genes. Immunohistochemical and immunofluorescence staining showed expression of AT2R, ACE2, PRR, and cathepsins B and D by cells expressing pluripotency markers. β-blockers and AT2R antagonists reduced cellular metabolism, pluripotency marker expression, and tumorsphere-forming capacity of CA-derived primary cell lines. This study suggests that the RAS is active in CSC-like cells in CA, and further investigation is warranted to determine whether RAS inhibition is a viable method of targeting CSCs."
https://openalex.org/W3194651564,"As the resolution of 3D printing techniques improves, the possibility of individualized, 3-ossicle constructions adds a new dimension to middle ear prostheses. In order to optimize these designs, it is essential to understand how the ossicles and ligaments work together to transmit sound, and thus how ligaments should be replicated in a middle ear reconstruction. The middle ear ligaments are thought to play a significant role in maintaining the position of the ossicles and constraining axis of rotation. Paradoxically, investigations of the role of ligaments to date have shown very little impact on middle ear sound transmission. We explored the role of the two attachments in the gerbil middle ear analogous to human ligaments, the posterior incudal ligament and the anterior mallear process, severing both attachments and measuring change in hearing sensitivity. The impact of severing the attachments on the position of the ossicular chain was visualized using synchrotron microtomography imaging of the middle ear. In contrast to previous studies, a threshold change on the order of 20 dB across a wide range of frequencies was found when both ligaments were severed. Concomitantly, a shift in position of the ossicles was observed from the x-ray imaging and 3D renderings of the ossicular chain. These findings contrast with previous studies, demonstrating that these ligaments play a significant role in the transmission of sound through the middle ear. It appears that both mallear and incudal ligaments must be severed in order to impair sound transmission. The results of this study have significance for middle ear reconstructive surgery and the design of 3D-printed three-ossicle biocompatible prostheses."
https://openalex.org/W3195211567,"Workers in climate exposed industries such as agriculture, construction, and manufacturing face increased health risks of working on high temperature days and may make decisions to reduce work on high-heat days to mitigate this risk. Utilizing the American Time Use Survey (ATUS) for the period 2003 through 2018 and historical weather data, we model the relationship between daily temperature and time allocation, focusing on hours worked by high-risk laborers. The results indicate that labor allocation decisions are context specific and likely driven by supply-side factors. We do not find a significant relationship between temperature and hours worked during the Great Recession (2008–2014), perhaps due to high competition for employment, however during periods of economic growth (2003–2007, 2015–2018) we find a significant reduction in hours worked on high-heat days. During periods of economic growth, for every degree above 90 on a particular day, the average high-risk worker reduces their time devoted to work by about 2.6 minutes relative to a 90-degree day. This effect is expected to intensify in the future as temperatures rise. Applying the modeled relationships to climate projections through the end of century, we find that annual lost wages resulting from decreased time spent working on days over 90 degrees across the United States range from $36.7 to $80.0 billion in 2090 under intermediate and high emission futures, respectively."
https://openalex.org/W3195612260,"Bag-1 is a multifunctional protein that regulates Hsp70 chaperone activity, apoptosis, and proliferation. The three major Bag-1 isoforms have different subcellular localizations and partly non-overlapping functions. To identify the detailed interaction network of each isoform, we utilized mass spectrometry-based proteomics and found that interactomes of Bag-1 isoforms contained many common proteins, with variations in their abundances. Bag-1 interactomes were enriched with proteins involved in protein processing and degradation pathways. Novel interaction partners included VCP/p97; a transitional ER ATPase, Rad23B; a shuttling factor for ubiquitinated proteins, proteasome components, and ER-resident proteins, suggesting a role for Bag-1 also in ER-associated protein degradation (ERAD). Bag-1 pull-down from cells and tissues from breast cancer patients validated these interactions and showed cancer-related prominence. Using in silico predictions we detected hotspot residues of Bag-1. Mutations of these residues caused loss of binding to protein quality control elements and impaired proteasomal activity in MCF-7 cells. Following CD147 glycosylation pattern, we showed that Bag-1 downregulated VCP/p97-dependent ERAD. Overall, our data extends the interaction map of Bag-1, and broadens its role in protein homeostasis. Targeting the interaction surfaces revealed in this study might be an effective strategy in the treatment of cancer."

Finally, with the coefficient correlation, determine the agricultural commodity that has the strongest and positive relationship with the total agricultural exports value from Colombia to the European Union."
https://openalex.org/W3160937307,"Human learners are rarely the passive recipients of valuable social information. Rather, learners usually have to actively seek out information from a variety of potential others to determine who is in a position to provide useful information. Yet, the majority of developmental social learning paradigms do not address participants' ability to seek out information for themselves. To investigate age-related changes in children's ability to seek out appropriate social information, 3- to 8-year-olds (N = 218) were presented with a task requiring them to identify which of four possible demonstrators could provide critical information for unlocking a box. Appropriate information seeking improved significantly with age. The particularly high performance of 7- and 8-year-olds was consistent with the expectation that older children's increased metacognitive understanding would allow them to identify appropriate information sources. Appropriate social information seeking may have been overlooked as a significant cognitive challenge involved in fully benefiting from others' knowledge, potentially influencing understanding of the phylogenetic distribution of cumulative culture."
https://openalex.org/W3193609709,"Chinese children routinely outperform American peers in standardized tests of mathematics knowledge. To examine mediators of this effect, 95 Chinese and US 5-year-olds completed a test of overall symbolic arithmetic, an IQ subtest, and three tests each of symbolic and non-symbolic numerical magnitude knowledge (magnitude comparison, approximate addition, and number-line estimation). Overall Chinese children performed better in symbolic arithmetic than US children, and all measures of IQ and number knowledge predicted overall symbolic arithmetic. Chinese children were more accurate than US peers in symbolic numerical magnitude comparison, symbolic approximate addition, and both symbolic and non-symbolic number-line estimation; Chinese and U.S. children did not differ in IQ and non-symbolic magnitude comparison and approximate addition. A substantial amount of the nationality difference in overall symbolic arithmetic was mediated by performance on the symbolic and number-line tests."
https://openalex.org/W3193840810,"Prediction models should be externally validated to assess their performance before implementation. Several prediction models for coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) have been published. This observational cohort study aimed to validate published models of severity for hospitalized patients with COVID-19 using clinical and laboratory predictors.Prediction models fitting relevant inclusion criteria were chosen for validation. The outcome was either mortality or a composite outcome of mortality and ICU admission (severe disease). 1295 patients admitted with symptoms of COVID-19 at Kings Cross Hospital (KCH) in London, United Kingdom, and 307 patients at Oslo University Hospital (OUH) in Oslo, Norway were included. The performance of the models was assessed in terms of discrimination and calibration.We identified two models for prediction of mortality (referred to as Xie and Zhang1) and two models for prediction of severe disease (Allenbach and Zhang2). The performance of the models was variable. For prediction of mortality Xie had good discrimination at OUH with an area under the receiver-operating characteristic (AUROC) 0.87 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.79-0.95] and acceptable discrimination at KCH, AUROC 0.79 [0.76-0.82]. In prediction of severe disease, Allenbach had acceptable discrimination (OUH AUROC 0.81 [0.74-0.88] and KCH AUROC 0.72 [0.68-0.75]). The Zhang models had moderate to poor discrimination. Initial calibration was poor for all models but improved with recalibration.The performance of the four prediction models was variable. The Xie model had the best discrimination for mortality, while the Allenbach model had acceptable results for prediction of severe disease."
https://openalex.org/W3195598827,"Introduction A family-centered care model (FCCM) providing family-based HIV services, rather than separate adult/pediatric services, has been proposed to increase pediatric retention and treatment adherence. Materials and methods Eight health-care facilities in the Hhohho region of Eswatini were randomized to implement FCCM (n = 4) or continue standard-of-care (SOC) separate adult/pediatric clinics (n = 4). HIV-positive children and caregivers were enrolled; caregiver interview and child/caregiver chart abstraction were done at enrollment and every three months; pediatric viral load was evaluated at enrollment and every six months through 12 months. Because of study group differences in 12-month viral load data availability (89.4% FCCM and 72.0% SOC children had 12-month viral load), we used three separate analyses to evaluate the effects of FCCM on children’s viral suppression (&lt;1,000 copies/mL) and undetectable virus (&lt;400 copies/mL) at 12 months. In the first analysis, all children with missing viral outcome data were excluded from the analysis (modified intent to treat, mITT). The second analysis used inverse probability of missingness weighted logistic regression to estimate the effect of FCCM on 12-month viral outcomes compared to SOC (weighted mITT). For the third approach, missing virologic outcome data were imputed as virologic failure (imputed ITT). We also examined factors associated with viral suppression at 12 months using multivariable logistic regression. Results We enrolled 379 HIV-positive children and 363 caregivers. Among all children at enrollment, viral suppression and undetectability was 78.4% and 73.9%, respectively, improving to 90.2% and 87.3% at 12 months. In mITT and weighted mITT analyses, there was no significant difference in children’s 12-month viral suppression between FCCM and SOC groups (89.2% and 91.6%, respectively). Using imputed ITT, there was a modest increase in 12-month viral suppression in FCCM versus SOC children (79.7% and 69.8%, respectively, p = 0.051) and 12-month undetectability (78.7% and 65.7%, respectively, p = 0.015). Among the 255 children suppressed at enrollment, more FCCM versus SOC children (98.0% versus 95.3%) were suppressed at 12-months, but this was not statistically significant in mITT or weighted mITT analyses, with a marginally significant difference using imputed mITT analysis (p = 0.042). A higher proportion of children suppressed at enrollment had undetectable viral load at 12 months in FCCM versus SOC children (98.0% versus 92.5%), a statistically significant difference across analytical methods. Among the 61 children unsuppressed at enrollment, achieving suppression was higher among SOC versus FCCM children, but this difference was not statistically significant and included only 38 children; and there were no significant differences in detectable viral load at 12 months. There were no significant differences between study groups in retention or ART adherence at 12 months for children or caregivers. Factors associated with lack of viral suppression/detectability at 12 months included lack of viral suppression at enrollment and having a younger caregiver (age &lt;25 years). Conclusions FCCM in Eswatini was associated with a modest increase in viral suppression/undetectability at 12-months; 12-month retention and adherence did not differ by study group for children or caregivers. High levels of suppression and retention in both groups may have limited our ability to detect a difference. Trial registration NCT03397420 ; ClinicalTrials.gov."
https://openalex.org/W3195800248,"Human papillomavirus type 31, although detected less frequently than HPV types 16 and 18, is associated with head and neck squamous cell carcinomas. Previous studies suggest that polymorphisms in the long control region (LCR) may alter the oncogenic potential of the virus. This study reports the first complete genome of a South African HPV31 isolate from a laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma. Sequence variations relative to the HPV31 prototype sequence were identified. The pBlue-Topo® vector, a reporter gene system was used to investigate the possible influence of these variations on the LCR promoter activity in vitro . Using mutagenesis to create two different fragments, β-galactosidase assays were used to monitor the effect of nucleotide variations on the p97 promoter. Increased β-galactosidase expression was observed in mutants when compared to the South African HPV31 LCR isolate. Enhanced transcriptional activity was observed with the mutant that possessed a single nucleotide change within the YY1 transcription factor binding site. In conclusion, sequence variation within the LCR of HPV31 isolates may have a functional effect on viral p97 promoter activity."
https://openalex.org/W3193380226,"Introduction/background Dengue fever remains a public health threat despite being preventable. A solution to the constant problem of dengue infection will require active intervention and a paradigm shift. Assessing perceived risk and correlating it with the attitude and practice of the community will help in designing appropriate measures. However, possible instruments for these assessments come with limitations. Objective The aim is to develop and validate a new scoring-based questionnaire, using dual statistical approaches to measure risk perception, attitude, and practices (RPAP) related to dengue in the community. Methods The RPAP questionnaire was developed bilingually using the International Society for Pharmacoeconomics and Outcome Research (ISPOR) guidelines. Content analysis was reviewed scrupulously by four expert panels. The initial 35-item scale was tested among 253 Malaysian respondents recruited non-probabilistically via multiple online platforms. Two statistical methods were employed to measure the construct validity: Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA) as part of the Classical Test Theory (CTT) measurement, while Rasch Measurement Analysis (Rasch) was performed for the Item Response Theory (IRT) measurement. All results were cross-validated with their counterpart to ensure stability. Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA) was used to obtain a model fit index. Results 29 questions were retained after the final analysis. Both EFA and Rasch analysis detect multidimensionality. Nine latent factors were extracted from EFA, while only eight factors remained in the final model following CFA: 1) perceived susceptibility; 2) perceived severity; 3) perceived barrier; 4) perceived benefit; 5) cues to action; 6) self-efficacy; 7) attitude; and 8) practice. All items had adequate factor loadings and showed good internal consistency. The final model after CFA achieved a good fit with an RMSEA value of 0.061, SRMR of 0.068, PNFI of 0.649, and GFI of 0.996. Conclusion The RPAP questionnaire contains 29 items and is a reliable and accurate psychometric instrument for measuring the risk perception of dengue fever, attitude, and practice of the community in dengue prevention. The Rasch measurement provides additional rigour to complement the CTT analysis. This RPAP questionnaire is suitable for use in studies related to dengue prevention in the community."
https://openalex.org/W3194883979,"Wild animals infected with Paracoccidioides brasiliensis represent important indicators of this fungal agent presence in the environment. The detection of this pathogen in road-killed wild animals has shown to be a key strategy for eco-epidemiological surveillance of paracoccidioidomycosis (PCM), helping to map hot spots for human infection. Molecular detection of P. brasiliensis in wild animals from PCM outbreak areas has not been performed so far. The authors investigated the presence of P. brasiliensis through nested-PCR in tissue samples obtained from road-killed animals collected nearby a human PCM outbreak spot, Rio de Janeiro state, Brazil and border areas. Eighteen species of mammals were analyzed: Dasypus novemcinctus (nine-banded armadillo, n = 6), Cerdocyon thous (crab-eating fox, n = 4), Coendou spinosus (hairy dwarf porcupine, n = 2), Lontra longicaudis (Neotropical river otter, n = 1), Procyon cancrivorus (crab-eating raccoon, n = 1), Galactis cuja (lesser grison, n = 1), Tamandua tetradactyla (collared anteater, n = 1), Cuniculus paca (paca, n = 1), and Bradypus variegatus (brown-throated three-toed sloth, n = 1). Specific P. brasiliensis sequences were detected in the liver, spleen, and lymph node samples from 4/6 (66.7%) D. novemcinctus, reinforcing the importance of these animals on Paracoccidioides ecology. Moreover, lymph nodes samples from two C. thous, as well as lung samples from the C. paca were also positive. A literature review of Paracoccidioides spp. in vertebrates in Brazil indicates C. thous and C. paca as new hosts for the fungal pathogen P. brasiliensis."
https://openalex.org/W3195664355,"Woolly apple aphid (WAA), Eriosoma lanigerum (Hausmann), is an important global pest that feeds on Malus species. We studied the feeding preference of WAA on apple trees in the field for two consecutive years and in the laboratory we used electronic penetration graphs (EPG) to record the stylet penetration behavior of WAA on different parts of apple trees. We found that in the field WAA fed primarily on twigs and branches, not on leaves and fruits. Six EPG waveforms were produced during WAA probing on shoots, trunks and leaves of apple trees, including the non-penetration wave (np), the stylet pathway phase wave (C), the intracellular feeding wave (pd), the xylem feeding wave (G), waves indicative of release of saliva into the phloem (E1), and a wave indicative of ingestion from phloem (E2). In the laboratory, aphids only successfully fed on shoots, trunks and leaves, not on fruits. The EPG parameters on the phloem of shoots were significantly higher than those on trunks, indicating WAA prefer to feed on shoots. These laboratory findings explain the relative field feeding preference of WAA on different parts of apple trees, which occurs primarily on branches, barks, and young twigs in orchards, especially on young twigs."
https://openalex.org/W3195886007,"The influence maximization problem (IMP) as classically formulated is based on the strong assumption that ""chosen"" nodes always adopt the new product. In this paper we propose a new influence maximization problem, referred to as the ""Link-based Influence Maximization Problem"" (LIM), which differs from IMP in that the decision variable of the spreader has changed from choosing an optimal seed to selecting an optimal node to influence in order to maximize the spread. Based on our proof that LIM is NP-hard with a monotonic increasing and submodular target function, we propose a greedy algorithm, GLIM, for optimizing LIM and use numerical simulation to explore the performance in terms of spread and computation time in different network types. The results indicate that the performance of LIM varies across network types. We illustrate LIM by applying it in the context of a Dutch national health promotion program for prevention of youth obesity within a network of Dutch schools. GLIM is seen to outperform the other methods in all network types at the cost of a higher computation time. These results suggests that GLIM may be utilized to increase the effectiveness of health promotion programs."
https://openalex.org/W3195365217,"The social standing of an artist provides a reliable proxy for the value of the artist’s product and reduces uncertainty about the quality of the product. While there are several different types of social standing, we focus on reputation among professional artists within the same genre, as they are best able to identify the artistic value of a product within that genre. To reveal the underlying means of attaining high social standing within the professional group, we examined two quantifiable properties that are closely associated with social standing, musical identity and the social position of the artist. We analyzed the playlist data of electronic dance music DJ/producers, DJs who also compose their own music. We crawled 98,332 tracks from 3,164 playlists by 815 DJs, who played at nine notable international music festivals. Information from the DJs’ tracks, including genre, beats per minute, and musical keys, was used to quantify musical identity, and playlists were transformed into network data to measure social positions among the DJs. We found that DJs with a distinct genre identity as well as network positions combining brokerage and cohesion tend to place higher in success and social standing."
