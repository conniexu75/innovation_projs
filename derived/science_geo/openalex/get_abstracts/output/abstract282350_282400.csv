https://openalex.org/W2156751729,The increase in algal reproductive rates caused by nitrogen regeneration from herbivorous zooplankton approximately equaled the zooplankton-caused mortality. This result demonstrates that nutrient regeneration by herbivores is at least sometimes a strong indirect effect in natural communities.
https://openalex.org/W1972945499,"The walkingstick, Anisomorpha buprestoides, has two defensive glands in its thorax from which it ejects an aimed spray when disturbed. Contact stimulation is the usual trigger for the discharge, but birds may elicit the spray by merely approaching the insect. The secretion proved effectively deterrent to ants, predaceous beetles, mice, and blue jays, but not to an opossum."
https://openalex.org/W2044013084,"In the cockroach there are two distinct sets of photoreceptors-the compound eyes and the ocelli-which may function as a sensory input whereby circadian locomotor rhythms are entrained by environmental light cycles. Surgical removal of the ocelli did not interfere with normal entrainment, but covering over the compound eyes effected a loss of entrainment."
https://openalex.org/W1964786356,"New data show the geographical pattern of frequency of the melanic morph carbonaria of the peppered moth, Biston betularia, in 1983-84. These frequencies are compared with data from 1952 to 1970. After 20 years of smoke control, the area of high melanic frequency has contracted to the northeast. The change indicates a disadvantage to carbonaria of about 12 percent compared with 20 years ago. Computer simulations, which do not include the assumption of heterozygote advantage, provide a good match to the surface for the period 1952 to 1970, and also the 1983-84 surface. Experiments on visual predation have been criticized as giving unrepresentative estimates of selection but they permit satisfactory simulations to be made."
https://openalex.org/W2073876014,"Microscopic examination of granodiorite samples from the shock region around a nuclear explosion reveals sharply folded lens-shaped zones (kink-bands) in the mineral biotite. Fifty percent of these zones are oriented approximately 90 degrees to the direction of shock-wave propagation, but other zones are symmetrically concentrated at shear angles of 50 degrees and 70 degrees to the direction of shock-wave propagation."
https://openalex.org/W2011927072,"Microscopic observations of growth layers and etch pits on ammonium dihydrogen phosphate crystals reveal screw dislocations on the {100} face generating elliptical spirals that change rapidly but reversibly to rectangular shape when chromium-ion impurity is added. The effects of the impurity on crystal habit are judged to be secondary to changes in the morphology of the growth layers. No sources of growth are observed on the {101} faces; the layers spread inward from the edges and at times are mutually annihilating so that, temporarily, no steps are observed. Similar behavior is recorded for the {1011} faces of NaNO(3)."
https://openalex.org/W2073513769,"By means of a precession camera incorporating a diamond-anvil high-pressure cell, x-ray diffraction data can be obtained from single crystals of ice VI produced and maintained under high pressures. The cell constants for ice VI at room temperature and approximately 9 kilobars are: a = 8.38 A, b = 6.17 A, c = 8.90 A. The unit cell is orthogonal and the space-group aspect is compatible with P**a. These data for single crystals agree with previously reported unindexed data obtained for polycrystalline ice VI, within the limits of experimental error. The single crystals of ice VI were grown in a diamond-anvil pressure cell, distilled water and a metal gasket being used."
https://openalex.org/W2058096371,"Five casts of lungfish burrows have been found in a quarry near Grand Ledge, Michigan, in shale of the Saginaw group, Middle Pennsylvanian. The burrows contain no fish remains, but they closely resemble lungfish burrows from the Lower Permian of Texas which contain remains of the genus Gnathorhiza."
https://openalex.org/W2092118382,"The studies of the chemistry of free carbon atoms described here represent only a start toward understanding the properties of this intriguing species. Although many important aspects of its chemistry, such as the influence of its electronic-spin state, are still poorly understood, some generalizations may be made."
https://openalex.org/W2009872577,The photoreceptor cells of the tube-dwelling polychaete Branchiomma vesiculosum contain stacked disc-shaped membranous sacs which are the expanded and flattened outer membranes of cilia.
https://openalex.org/W1989835572,"Whereas most chondrites contain sodic plagioclase (or occasionally maskelynite, its glassy equivalent), a few are free of feldspar. Absence of plagioclase is correlated with the presence of calcium-poor clinopyroxene (pigeonite sensu lato) instead of orthopyroxene. Olivine in feldspar-free chondrites is frequently variable in composition; in feldspar-bearing chondrites this mineral has essentially uniform composition. It appears that the silicate material of most chondrites was initially an association of olivine and pigeonite (or perhaps olivine and glass), and recrystallization has produced the usual olivine-orthopyroxene-sodic plagioclase association."
https://openalex.org/W2031348663,"Subtraction from the new data, of a quadratic surface fitted to the taxonomic diversity data of recent planktonic foraminifera yields a residual surface closely related to ocean current systems. This technique could be applied to fossil materials to develop knowledge of ocean circulation patterns during glacial and interglacial climatic episodes."
https://openalex.org/W1984555621,"It will be apparent from this far-too-hasty view that, in the past, most knowledge of materials has been gained by the intelligent empiricist, and that the role of science has been to explain and to provide better control rather than to open up new areas. It may be that in complex fields this is inevitable, for science invokes subtle abstractions which are necessarily concerned sequentially with parts rather than simultaneously with a whole system. But how enormously better off we are now than we were in 1900, for we at least now understand the physical principles behind most of the properties of ceramics and metals, and more than one practical achievement stems directly from a scientist's suggestion. No practical man now understands metals better than the solid-state physicist; this was certainly not true even as little as 20 years ago. Yet the likelihood that pure science will lead directly to the discovery of really new materials will be only slightly greater in the future than it was in the past unless methods for handling wholes can be developed that are precise enough to be called scientific and communicable enough to be taught. This is a task that the scientist has in the past rightly and profitably refused to accept. We need a supergenius to develop some principles, not of simple particles and their interactions, but of extremely complex structures with parts interacting with other parts, on all levels, and with a hierarchy of interpenetrating substructures combining to form many levels of interpenetrating superstructure (21)."
https://openalex.org/W2004899788,"An area of some 18 square kilometers at the head of Wright Dry Valley displays an erosional terrain of unique characteristics-a labyrinthine complex of erratic, interconnecting channels cut to depths of more than 100 meters in bedrock. It is interpreted as a result of catastrophic fluvial erosion, probably analogous to that which produced the Channeled Scabland of eastern Washington, though on a greatly reduced areal scale."
https://openalex.org/W1998155812,"The term ""middle Miocene Caribbean province"" is used for a faunal province that embraced both western Atlantic and eastern Pacific waters. The percentage of endemic species in 13 local faunas in that province is tabulated. In general the largest faunas have the highest percentage of endemic species, but notable exceptions to that generalization are apparent. Many examples of discontinuous distribution of species and genera, which are not relicts, support the conclusion that much of the endemisim is apparent rather than real."
https://openalex.org/W2015421075,"At least some of the changes in the color of Mars at different seasons are caused by color centers produced by electromagnetic and corpuscular solar radiation in solids on the surface. Calculated radiation flux, at appropriate energies and known temperature variation, could account for seasonal formation of color centers and bleaching if a simple trap model is assumed. In certain kinds of rhyolite (SiO(2), NaAlSi(3)O(8)), which has been suggested as one of the possible constituents of the martian surface, color centers can be produced. No color centers are expected in limonite, Fe(2)O(3) . 3H(2)O, the other likely constituent."

Cesium-137 is an expected fission product, but the origin of the other two radionuclides is not certain."
https://openalex.org/W2023242579,A probe for measuring emission of gamma-rays in sediments in situ in water depths to about 35 meters was used to measure radioactivity in the Columbia River estuary and Oregon coastal areas. This technique offers some advantage over methods in which sediment samples are collected at sea and returned to the laboratory for radioanalysis.
