https://openalex.org/W3142311783,"SARS-CoV-2 is a rapidly spreading coronavirus responsible for the Covid-19 pandemic, which is characterized by severe respiratory infection. Many factors have been identified as risk factors for SARS-CoV-2, with much early attention being paid to body mass index (BMI), which is a well-known cardiometabolic risk factor.This study seeks to examine the impact of additional baseline cardiometabolic risk factors including high density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-C), low density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C), Apolipoprotein A-I (ApoA-I), Apolipoprotein B (ApoB), triglycerides, hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) and diabetes on the odds of testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 in UK Biobank (UKB) study participants.We examined the effect of BMI, lipid profiles, diabetes and alcohol intake on the odds of testing positive for SARS-Cov-2 among 9,005 UKB participants tested for SARS-CoV-2 from March 16 through July 14, 2020. Odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals were computed using logistic regression adjusted for age, sex and ancestry.Higher BMI, Type II diabetes and HbA1c were associated with increased SARS-CoV-2 odds (p < 0.05) while HDL-C and ApoA-I were associated with decreased odds (p < 0.001). Though the effect of BMI, Type II diabetes and HbA1c were eliminated when HDL-C was controlled, the effect of HDL-C remained significant when BMI was controlled for. LDL-C, ApoB and triglyceride levels were not found to be significantly associated with increased odds.Elevated HDL-C and ApoA-I levels were associated with reduced odds of testing positive for SARS-CoV-2, while higher BMI, type II diabetes and HbA1c were associated with increased odds. The effects of BMI, type II diabetes and HbA1c levels were no longer significant after controlling for HDL-C, suggesting that these effects may be mediated in part through regulation of HDL-C levels. In summary, our study suggests that baseline HDL-C level may be useful for stratifying SARS-CoV-2 infection risk and corroborates the emerging picture that HDL-C may confer protection against sepsis in general and SARS-CoV-2 in particular."
https://openalex.org/W3148846025,"Background Several research efforts have evaluated the impact of various factors including a) socio-demographics, (b) health indicators, (c) mobility trends, and (d) health care infrastructure attributes on COVID-19 transmission and mortality rate. However, earlier research focused only on a subset of variable groups (predominantly one or two) that can contribute to the COVID-19 transmission/mortality rate. The current study effort is designed to remedy this by analyzing COVID-19 transmission/mortality rates considering a comprehensive set of factors in a unified framework. Methods and findings We study two per capita dependent variables: (1) daily COVID-19 transmission rates and (2) total COVID-19 mortality rates. The first variable is modeled using a linear mixed model while the later dimension is analyzed using a linear regression approach. The model results are augmented with a sensitivity analysis to predict the impact of mobility restrictions at a county level. Several county level factors including proportion of African-Americans, income inequality, health indicators associated with Asthma, Cancer, HIV and heart disease, percentage of stay at home individuals, testing infrastructure and Intensive Care Unit capacity impact transmission and/or mortality rates. From the policy analysis, we find that enforcing a stay at home order that can ensure a 50% stay at home rate can result in a potential reduction of about 33% in daily cases. Conclusions The model framework developed can be employed by government agencies to evaluate the influence of reduced mobility on transmission rates at a county level while accommodating for various county specific factors. Based on our policy analysis, the study findings support a county level stay at home order for regions currently experiencing a surge in transmission. The model framework can also be employed to identify vulnerable counties that need to be prioritized based on health indicators for current support and/or preferential vaccination plans (when available)."
https://openalex.org/W3151254369,"Transcriptomes are known to organize themselves into gene co-expression clusters or modules where groups of genes display distinct patterns of coordinated or synchronous expression across independent biological samples. The functional significance of these co-expression clusters is suggested by the fact that highly coexpressed groups of genes tend to be enriched in genes involved in common functions and biological processes. While gene co-expression is widely assumed to reflect close regulatory proximity, the validity of this assumption remains unclear. Here we use a simple synthetic gene regulatory network (GRN) model and contrast the resulting co-expression structure produced by these networks with their known regulatory architecture and with the co-expression structure measured in available human expression data. Using randomization tests, we found that the levels of co-expression observed in simulated expression data were, just as with empirical data, significantly higher than expected by chance. When examining the source of correlated expression, we found that individual regulators, both in simulated and experimental data, fail, on average, to display correlated expression with their immediate targets. However, highly correlated gene pairs tend to share at least one common regulator, while most gene pairs sharing common regulators do not necessarily display correlated expression. Our results demonstrate that widespread co-expression naturally emerges in regulatory networks, and that it is a reliable and direct indicator of active co-regulation in a given cellular context."

https://openalex.org/W3140989604,"Background Common mental disorders in early life represent a major concern as they become more complex and intense with transition into adolescence. Despite global recognition of the significance of adolescent mental health, it remains a neglected area in research and health policy in Bangladesh. This study aimed to investigate the prevalence and factors associated with depression and anxiety among school going adolescents in Bangladesh. Methods A cross-sectional survey was conducted among 563 students aged 13–18 years at selected schools (secondary and higher secondary) in Dhaka City. After providing written informed consent, participants completed a survey examining socio-demographic variables, along with the PHQ-9 and GAD-7 scales. Logistic regression was used to examine associations between variables under examination. Results The prevalence rates of moderate to severe levels of depression and anxiety were 26.5% and 18.1%, respectively. Based on multivariable analyses, unsatisfactory sleep (AOR = 3.17; 95% CI = 1.81–5.53, p &lt; .001), cigarette smoking (AOR = 2.00; 95% CI = 1.01–3.97, p = .048), and anxiety (AOR = 10.47; 95% CI = 6.11–17.95, p &lt; .001) were associated with depression. Anxiety was associated with being 15–16 years (AOR = 2.66; 95% CI = 1.18–6.00, p = .018), not having good perceived relationships with friends (AOR = 2.10; 95% CI = 1.24–3.56, p = .006) and depression (AOR = 10.22; 95% CI = 6.01–17.38, p &lt; .001). Conclusions Depression and anxiety were prevalent among school going adolescents in Bangladesh. The findings suggest epidemiological data can direct policy-level decisions regarding evaluation, prevention, and intervention of mental health conditions among school going adolescents in Bangladesh."
https://openalex.org/W3141121992,"This study aims to document the dual mode of pharmacological action of moringa isothiocyanate-1 (MIC-1) derived from seeds of Moringa oleifera Lam. Oral administration of chemically stable MIC-1 (80 mg/kg) significantly reduced the expression of inflammatory markers (Tnf-α, Ifn-α, IL-1β, IL-6) in the liver, kidney, spleen, and colon and decreased spleen weight in the lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced sepsis / acute inflammation model in mice. Transcriptomic analysis of the effect of MIC-1 on the liver and in the LPS-induced RAW264.7 murine macrophage showed that MIC-1 decreases inflammation via inflammation, immunity, and oxidative stress pathways. These results are supported by the immunocytochemical observations that MIC-1 increased the nuclear accumulation of nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-like 2 (Nrf2) transcription factor and decreased the nuclear accumulation of nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-κB) in the LPS-induced macrophages. Transcriptional activation of antioxidant genes by MIC-1 translated into a reduction of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the cytoplasm, decrease of mitochondrial superoxide content, and restoration of the mitochondrial membrane potential in the LPS-induced macrophages. Our data indicate that MIC-1 affects inflammation and oxidative stress, two key processes involved in the etiology of many chronic diseases. These effects involve upstream regulation of two key transcriptional factors regulating responses to these processes at a gene expression level."
https://openalex.org/W3140703463,"The neural representation of a ‘biological self’ is linked theoretically to the control of bodily physiology. In an influential model, selfhood relates to internal agency and higher-order interoceptive representation, inferred from the predicted impact of efferent autonomic nervous activity on afferent viscerosensory feedback. Here we tested if an altered representation of physical self (illusory embodiment of an artificial hand) is accompanied by sustained shifts in autonomic activity. Participants (N = 37) underwent procedures for induction of the rubber hand illusion (synchronous stroking of own unseen hand and observed stroking of artificial hand) and a control condition (asychronous stroking). We recorded electrocardiography, electrodermal activity, and a non-invasive measure of multiunit skin sympathetic nerve activity (SKNA) from the chest. We compared these autonomic indices between task conditions, and between individuals who did and did not experience the illusion. Bayes factors quantified the strength of evidence for and against null hypotheses. Observed proprioceptive drift and subjective reports confirmed the efficacy of the synchronous (vs asynchronous) condition in inducing illusory hand ownership. Stringent discriminant analysis classified 24/37 individuals as experiencing the rubber hand illusion. Surprisingly, heart rate, heart rate variability, electrodermal activity, and SKNA measures revealed no autonomic differences between synchronous vs asynchronous conditions, nor between individuals who did or did not experience the rubber hand illusion. Bayes factors indicated substantial evidence for no physiological differences. In contrast to earlier reports, our autonomic data show the absence of a reliable change in physiological state during the rubber hand illusion. More encompassing perturbations of self-experience, for example in full body illusions, may nevertheless be coupled to, or facilitated by, changes in efferent autonomic activity and afferent viscerosensory feedback. Our findings suggest that such changes in bodily physiology are not sustained as an obligatory component of the rubber hand illusion."
https://openalex.org/W3149503875,"Objectives To characterize psychological distress and factors associated with distress in healthcare practitioners working during a stringent lockdown in a country (Jordan) that had exhibited one of the lowest incidence rates of Covid-19 globally at the time of the survey. Methods A cross-sectional online survey sent to healthcare practitioners working in various hospitals and community pharmacies. Demographic, professional and psychological characteristics (distress using Kessler-6 questionnaire, anxiety, depression, burnout, sleep issues, exhaustion) were measured as were sources of fear. Descriptive and multivariable statistics were performed using level of distress as the outcome. Results We surveyed 937 practitioners (56.1% females). Approximately 68%, 14%, and 18% were nurses/technicians, physicians, and pharmacists (respectively). 32% suffered from high distress while 20% suffered from severe distress. Exhaustion, anxiety, depression, and sleep disturbances were reported (in past seven days) by approximately 34%, 34%, 19%, and 29% of subjects (respectively). Being older or male, a positive perception of communications with peers, and being satisfied at work, were significantly associated with lower distress. Conversely, suffering burnout; reporting sleep-related functional problems; exhaustion; being a pharmacist (relative to a physician); working in a cancer center; harboring fear about virus spreading; fear that the virus threatened life; fear of alienation from family/friends; and fear of workload increases, were significantly associated with higher distress. Conclusion Despite low caseloads, Jordanian practitioners still experienced high levels of distress. Identified demographic, professional and psychological factors influencing distress should inform interventions to improve medical professionals’ resilience and distress likelihood, regardless of the variable Covid-19 situation."
https://openalex.org/W3149319341,"Background Evaluation of patients`satisfaction towards pharmacy services is of utmost importance to ensure the quality of care. It helps in identifying domains requiring improvements to provide high quality pharmacy services to ensure the provision of enhanced pharmaceutical care. The current study aims to ascertain the extent of satisfaction towards pharmacy services among patients attending outpatient pharmacies in Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. Methods A hospital-based cross-sectional study involving 746 patients attending outpatient pharmacies of various public hospitals was conducted from 01 January to 15 February 2020. Information on socio-demographic profile of the study subjects along with their satisfaction towards outpatient pharmacy was extracted by using a 23-items questionnaire. These questions were divided into two domains including 7 questions related to the pharmacy facilities (questions from 1F to 7F) and 8 questions for pharmacy services (questions from 1S to 8S), where F and S denotes facilities and services, respectively. The cumulative satisfaction score was estimated by a 5-item Likert scale with a maximum score of 5 for each item. The relationship between demographics and satisfaction scores was evaluated by using appropriate statistics. Results There were 746 patients with male preponderance (58.8%). The overall satisfaction score was 2.97 ± 0.65. Satisfaction towards pharmacy services scored lower (mean score: 3.91 ± 0.77) than pharmacy facilities (mean score: 4.03 ± 0.66). Items related to patient`s counseling (3F, 2S, 3S, 6S) scored least during the analysis. Older patients (p = 0.006), male gender (p&lt;0.001), Saudi nationality (0.035), patients attending primary care centers (p = 0.02), and patients with chronic illnesses were significantly associated with lower satisfaction score. Conclusion This study reported that the satisfaction level of patients attending outpatient pharmacies was low and differed among various socio-demographic groups. Approximately one-half of the patients were not satisfied with outpatient pharmacy services. These findings underscore the dire need for managerial interventions including the hiring of trained professionals, onsite training of pharmacy staff, initiation of clinical or patient centered pharmacy services, evaluation of patient`s response towards the services and appropriate controlling measures, irrespective to the type of hospitals."
https://openalex.org/W3013218750,"Cognitive behavioural correlates to bereavement-related mental health problems such a Prolonged Grief Disorder (PGD) and Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) are of theoretical and clinical importance.Individuals bereaved at least six months (N = 647) completed measures of loss-related cognitions and behaviours (i.e., loss-related memory characteristics, negative appraisals, coping strategies, grief resilience, and perceived social disconnection) and measures of PGD and PTSD symptoms. Individuals were assigned to one of four groups depending on probable clinical diagnoses (No-PGD/PTSD, PTSD, PGD, PGD+PTSD).Results indicated that higher loss-related memory characteristics and lower grief resilience increased the likelihood of a clinical problem. The PGD and PGD+PTSD groups reported significantly higher loss-related memory characteristics and appraisals compared to the PTSD group. Social disconnection increased the likelihood of comorbid PGD+PTSD in comparison to any other group.Results indicate cognitive differences between loss-related cognitions, memory characteristics and coping strategies between PGD and PTSD, and points to distinct cognitive correlates to psychopathology following loss."
https://openalex.org/W3142470195,"Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is defined as the condition of fat accumulation in the liver. This cross-sectional study aimed to investigate the relationship between body composition and fatty liver and determine of cut-off point for predicting NAFLD. Samples were selected from the nutrition clinic from 2016 to 2017 in Tehran, Iran. The liver steatosis was calculated using the CAP score through the FiroScan ™ and body composition was measured using the dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry scan method. A total of 2160 patients participated in this study, 745 (34.5%) subjects had NAFLD. We found that fat-free tissue was inversely and fat tissue was directly correlated with the risk of NAFLD in almost all factors and the risk of developing NAFLD increases if the total fat exceeds 32.23% and 26.73% in women and men and abdominal fat exceeds 21.42% and 13.76% in women and men, respectively. Finally, we realized that the total fat percent had the highest AUC (0.932 for men and 0.917 for women) to predict the risk of NAFLD. Overall, the likelihood of NAFLD development rose significantly with increasing the amount of total fat and abdominal fat from the cut-off point level."
https://openalex.org/W3140187804,"Background Fractures around the knee joint are inherently complex in terms of treatment; complication rates are high, and they are difficult to diagnose on a plain radiograph. An automated way of classifying radiographic images could improve diagnostic accuracy and would enable production of uniformly classified records of fractures to be used in researching treatment strategies for different fracture types. Recently deep learning, a form of artificial intelligence (AI), has shown promising results for interpreting radiographs. In this study, we aim to evaluate how well an AI can classify knee fractures according to the detailed 2018 AO-OTA fracture classification system. Methods We selected 6003 radiograph exams taken at Danderyd University Hospital between the years 2002–2016, and manually categorized them according to the AO/OTA classification system and by custom classifiers. We then trained a ResNet-based neural network on this data. We evaluated the performance against a test set of 600 exams. Two senior orthopedic surgeons had reviewed these exams independently where we settled exams with disagreement through a consensus session. Results We captured a total of 49 nested fracture classes. Weighted mean AUC was 0.87 for proximal tibia fractures, 0.89 for patella fractures and 0.89 for distal femur fractures. Almost ¾ of AUC estimates were above 0.8, out of which more than half reached an AUC of 0.9 or above indicating excellent performance. Conclusion Our study shows that neural networks can be used not only for fracture identification but also for more detailed classification of fractures around the knee joint."
https://openalex.org/W3143008270,"Market participation among beef cattle farmers is key to ensuring better income, food security, and sustainable beef supply. Farmers in the traditional beef cattle sector, nevertheless, are well known for their low market participation. This study, thus, sought to examine factors that influenced market participation among beef cattle farmers in the Meatu district of Simiyu region, Tanzania. The study randomly selected a sample size of 393 farmers. The cross-sectional data collected through interviews and questionnaires were analyzed using descriptive statistics and ordinary least squares (OLS) regression models. The descriptive analyses showed that the average age of the interviewees was 53.73 years with a family size of 13.11. On average, the respondents had about 24.14 years of farming experience. Most of the respondents (67.9%) had primary education. Among the respondents, about 61.3%, 4.6%, and 32.6% had access to market information, farm credits, and veterinary services, respectively. The average cattle herd size was 53.46 heads. About 90.1% of farmers had participated in the markets by selling an average of 5 heads each, per year. This study has revealed low volume of sales, low education levels, and poor access to credits and veterinary services as the major factors that limit market participation. Furthermore, econometric results show that the key factors that significantly influenced farmers to increase the volume of beef cattle sales in the market at P &lt; 0 . 05 included price, herd size, off-farm income, distance to market, age of the farmer, and cattle fattening. Moreover, membership in cooperatives, access to market information, and farming experience also had significant influence at P &lt; 0 . 05 . This study recommends establishment of strategic cooperatives to function not only as a communication channel for farm credits, price, market information, and training on commercial farming, but also to assist farmers in selection of profitable markets."
https://openalex.org/W3145212060,"We evaluated in this cohort study the predictive ability of 23 peripheral blood parameters and ratios for treatment outcomes after the 2-month intensive phase in patients with PTB. In 63 patients out of 90 that turned culture negative, a significant decrease in white blood cell count, neutrophils, monocyte, hemoglobin, platelet, plateletcrit, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, MLR, NLR, PLR and SII values after anti-TB therapy compared to pretreatment was observed (p &lt;0.001). Logistic regression analysis generated a model of predictors consisting of nine covariates. Spearman’s correlation analysis revealed significant positive correlations between NLR with NEU (r = 0.79, p&lt;0.01), SII with NEU (r = 0.846, p&lt;0.01), PLT with SII (r = 0.831, p&lt;0.01), PLT with PCT (r = 0.71, p&lt;0.01) and MPV with P-LCR (r = 0,897, p&lt;0.01) in 63 patients out of 90 that turned culture negative after 2 months of treatment. ROC curve analysis indicated that all areas under the curve (AUC) revealed no statistically significant results, except lymphocyte for culture conversion. In summary, here we observed a set of hematological parameters that declined significantly as the disease was treated in patients that turned culture negative. Despite some limitations, our findings are useful for further studies aiming to identify hematological profiles that could predict the treatment outcome."
https://openalex.org/W3149081938,"Background Women who have experienced adolescent pregnancy and early motherhood are disproportionately affected in terms of their health and parenting capabilities, as well as their offspring’s health. Guided by Stress Process and Social Determinants of Health (SDH) Frameworks, which posit that multiple sources of stressors and structural determinants of adolescent pregnancy influence adolescent mothers’ subsequent health and quality of parenting (Xavier et al 2018, McLoyd 1998, Conger et al 2010, Gipson et al 2008). These dynamics then further impact offspring’s outcomes. Using an Integrated Stress-SDH Process for Health Disparities model and we test on whether early motherhood is associated with and subsequent maternal and child health from two informal settlements in Nairobi. Methods A cross-sectional design with 394 mothers of 2–16 years old children who sought maternal and child health services at Kariobangi and Kangemi public health centers between October 2015 to April 2016 were recruited. Participating mothers were asked questions related to their adolescent pregnancy history, their current health, wellbeing, and parenting practices, and their child’s health. Structural equation modeling (SEM) was utilized to examine hypothesized mediational pathways that adolescent pregnancy history has negative influences on women’s health and parenting during adulthood, which also influence their child’s health and development. Results Our study supports that women with a history of adolescent motherhood have poor physical and mental health outcomes as adults after adjusting for demographic confounders. SEM results partially support the Stress-SDH Process model that history of adolescent pregnancy had negative consequences on women’s adulthood health, which also negatively impacted offspring’s physical and mental health. Conclusion Consistent with the Stress Process and SDH literature, we found consistent cross-cultural literature that adolescent pregnancy set the stage for, subsequent poor maternal health and child outcomes. Although history of adolescent pregnancy and motherhood was not necessarily associated with negative parenting, consistent with parenting literature, negative parenting was associated with poor child mental health. Findings suggest importance of providing integrated care that address health and parenting needs to optimize offspring’s development in instances of early motherhood."
https://openalex.org/W3148456652,"Introduction Preventing tuberculosis (TB) disease requires treatment of latent TB infection (LTBI) as well as prevention of person-to-person transmission. We estimated the LTBI prevalence for the entire United States and for each state by medical risk factors, age, and race/ethnicity, both in the total population and stratified by nativity. Methods We created a mathematical model using all incident TB disease cases during 2013–2017 reported to the National Tuberculosis Surveillance System that were classified using genotype-based methods or imputation as not attributed to recent TB transmission. Using the annual average number of TB cases among US-born and non-US-born persons by medical risk factor, age group, and race/ethnicity, we applied population-specific reactivation rates (and corresponding 95% confidence intervals [CI]) to back-calculate the estimated prevalence of untreated LTBI in each population for the United States and for each of the 50 states and the District of Columbia in 2015. Results We estimated that 2.7% (CI: 2.6%–2.8%) of the U.S. population, or 8.6 (CI: 8.3–8.8) million people, were living with LTBI in 2015. Estimated LTBI prevalence among US-born persons was 1.0% (CI: 1.0%–1.1%) and among non-US-born persons was 13.9% (CI: 13.5%–14.3%). Among US-born persons, the highest LTBI prevalence was in persons aged ≥65 years (2.1%) and in persons of non-Hispanic Black race/ethnicity (3.1%). Among non-US-born persons, the highest LTBI prevalence was estimated in persons aged 45–64 years (16.3%) and persons of Asian and other racial/ethnic groups (19.1%). Conclusions Our estimations of the prevalence of LTBI by medical risk factors and demographic characteristics for each state could facilitate planning for testing and treatment interventions to eliminate TB in the United States. Our back-calculation method feasibly estimates untreated LTBI prevalence and can be updated using future TB disease case counts at the state or national level."
https://openalex.org/W3150074571,"Animal symbolism is a prominent feature of many human societies globally. In some cases, these symbolic attributes manifest in the technological domain, influencing the decision to use the bones of certain animals and not others for tool manufacture. In southern Africa, animals feature prominently in the cosmogenic narratives of both hunter-gatherer and Bantu-speaking farmer groups. Whenever these two culturally distinct groups came into contact with each other there would be an assimilation of cosmogenic concepts of power and the adoption of certain symbolically important animals. In this paper, we report on which animals were selected to make bone tools during the first millennium AD contact period in KwaZulu-Natal Province, South Africa, and explore the extent to which this selection may have been influenced by the symbolic associations of specific animals. Our results show selective targeting of specific animals for tool manufacture at some sites, with a narrowing of the range of selected species during the first millennium AD contact period. Certain antelope tribes, such as Aepycerotini, Cephalophini and Antilopini, appear to have been deliberately avoided, thus arguing against opportunistic selection. Nor does the range of selected animals appear to show any obvious mechanical considerations, as has been noted in similar studies. We highlight the potential of ZooMS for understanding the dynamics of animal symbolism in the past."
https://openalex.org/W3142487599,"Background On January 30 th 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared a international health emergency due to the unprecedented phenomenon of COVID-19. After this declaration countries swiftly implemented a variety of health policies. In this work we examine how rapid countries responded to this pandemic using two events: the day in which the first case of COVID-19 was reported, and first day in which countries used school closure as one of the measures to avoid outbreaks. We also assessed how countries’ health systems, globalization, economic development, political systems, and economic integration to China, Republic of Korea and Italy increased the speed of adoption. Methods We compiled information from multiple sources, from December 31 st 2019 to June 1 st 2020, to trace when 172 countries reported their first COVID-19 case and implemented school closure to contain outbreaks. We applied cross-national Weibull survival analysis to evaluate the global speed of detection of first COVID-19 reported cases and school closure. Results Ten days after WHO declared COVID-19 to be an international emergency, relative to seven days from this declaration, countries were 28 (95% CI: 12–77) times more likely to report first COVID-19 cases and 42 (95% CI: 22–90) times more likely to close schools. One standard deviation increase in the epidemic security index rises the rate of report first cases by 37% (Hazard Ratio (HR) 1.37 (95% CI: 1.09–1.72) and delays the adoption for school closures by 36% (HR 0.64 (95% CI:0.50–0.82). One standard deviation increase in the globalization index augments the adoption for school closures by 74% (HR 1.74 (95% CI:1.34–2.24). Conclusion After the WHO declared a global emergency, countries were unprecedently acting very rapidly. While countries more globally integrated were swifter in closing schools, countries with better designed health systems to tackle epidemics were slower in adopting it. More studies are needed to assess how the speed of school closures and other policies will affect the development of the pandemic."
https://openalex.org/W3139772799,"Background The concept of ‘child marriage’ in global health distinguishes ostensibly harmful from healthy ages to marry at a universally-applied threshold of 18-years. With intensifying efforts to end child marriage, targeted communities are increasingly asked to change their perception of such marriages from relatively benign to profoundly problematic. The objective of this study is to understand how this shift in perception is navigated by adolescent girls and young women (AGYW). Methods Using qualitative data collected in 2019 from a semi-urban community in Tanzania where marriage under 18-years is common and campaigns to end child marriage ongoing, we contrast reports of lived experiences of marriage under 18-years among AGYW to views of child marriage as an abstract concept. Thirteen in-depth interviews with AGYW, as part of a wider qualitative study, were recorded, transcribed, and analyzed using a framework analysis approach. Results While many AGYW had heard of child marriage, the concept was routinely conflated with forced marriage, which is rare in the community, and non-marital teenage sex and pregnancy, which are common. As a likely consequence, participants disagreed on whether or not child marriage occurs locally. Furthermore, accounts of real-life marriages under 18 sometimes aligned with, but often departed from, common narratives about the purported causes and harmful consequences inherent to the global health concept of child marriage. Conclusions We argue that engaging with diverse local views and experiences of marrying young is essential to producing culturally-sensitive, effective initiatives addressing the vulnerabilities of female adolescence."
https://openalex.org/W3140429604,"Background Polyethylene covers are claimed to be useful in preventing ocular surface diseases (OSD); however, evidence of their clinical efficacy is limited. This clinical trial aimed to compare the use of polyethylene eye covers and artificial teardrops versus normal saline on the incidence and severity of OSD in comatose patients. Methods Of 90 eligible patients randomly assigned to three treatment groups, 79 patients completed the study, In group A, patients (n = 25) received artificial teardrops for left and normal saline for right eyes, in group B (n = 29) polyethylene covers for left and normal saline for right eyes, and in group C (n = 25) polyethylene covers for left and artificial teardrops for right eyes. As the patients were comatose, their blinding did not applicable, and a blinded observer evaluated the patients’ eyes based on the Corneal Fluorescein Staining Pattern. The blinded analyzer analyzed collected data by SPSS-16 software at a 95% confidential level. Results The OSDs were observed in 65 (41.14%) out of 158 eyes examined. The artificial teardrop was more effective than the normal saline in group A, polyethylene eye cover was more useful than the normal saline in group B, and polyethylene eye cover was more effective than the artificial teardrop in group C in reducing the incidence of OSD (p&lt; 0.01). Polyethylene eye covers had the most impact on reducing the severity of the OSD compared to the other interventions (p&lt; .001). Conclusions Polyethylene eye covers significantly reduced the incidence and severity of OSD. Using polyethylene cover is suggested as a safe, effective, and accessible eye care intervention for preventing OSD in comatose patients.

https://openalex.org/W3142359244,"Background The incidence of Acute Kidney Injury (AKI) and its human and economic cost is increasing steadily. One way to reduce the burden associated with AKI is to prevent the event altogether. An important step in prevention lies in AKI risk prediction. Due to the increasing number of available risk prediction models (RPMs) clinicians need to be able to rely on systematic reviews (SRs) to provide an objective assessment on which RPM can be used in a specific setting. Our aim was to assess the quality of SRs of RPMs in AKI. Methods The protocol for this overview was registered in PROSPERO. MEDLINE and Embase were searched for SRs of RPMs of AKI in any setting from 2003 till August 2020. We used the ROBIS tool to assess the methodological quality of the retrieved SRs. Results Eight SRs were retrieved. All studies were assessed as being at high risk for bias using the ROBIS tool. Eight reviews had a high risk of bias in study eligibility criteria (domain 1), five for study identification and selection (domain 2), seven for data collection and appraisal (domain 3) and seven for synthesis and findings (domain 4). Five reviews were scored at high risk of bias across all four domains. Risk of bias assessment with a formal risk of bias tool was only performed in five reviews. Primary studies were heterogeneous and used a wide range of AKI definitions. Only 19 unique RPM were externally validated, of which 11 had only 1 external validation report. Conclusion The methodological quality of SRs of RPMs of AKI is inconsistent. Most SRs lack a formal risk of bias assessment. SRs ought to adhere to certain standard quality criteria so that clinicians can rely on them to select a RPM for use in an individual patient.

https://openalex.org/W3142464929,"During the Covid-19 pandemic, the Vietnamese government has actively implemented various policies to achieve dual objectives: (i) to minimize the loss of life due to the infection; and (ii) to support economic growth. This paper is conducted to examine the effect of the government’s containment and closure policy on the stock market quality in Vietnam. Unlike other papers, we focus exclusively on market quality during the pandemic. We find that the policies appear to positively affect the market quality, except for closing-school policy (negative effect) and international travel (no effect). We argue that the government should sustain the policies until the wide availability of the vaccine to support the stock market quality in the near future."
https://openalex.org/W3143048176,"Severe ulcerative colitis (UC) is a potentially life-threatening disease with a potential colorectal cancer (CRC) risk. The aim of this study was to explore the relationship between transcriptomic and genome-wide DNA methylation profiles in a well-stratified, treatment-naïve severe UC patient population in order to define specific epigenetic changes that could be responsible for the grade of disease severity. Mucosal biopsies from treatment-naïve severe UC patients (n = 8), treatment-naïve mild UC (n = 8), and healthy controls (n = 8) underwent both whole transcriptome RNA-Seq and genome-wide DNA bisulfite- sequencing, and principal component analysis (PCA), cell deconvolutions and diverse statistical methods were applied to obtain a dataset of significantly differentially expressed genes (DEGs) with correlation to DNA methylation for severe UC. DNA hypo-methylation correlated with approximately 80% of all DEGs in severe UC when compared to mild UC. Enriched pathways of annotated hypo-methylated genes revealed neutrophil degranulation, and immuno-regulatory interactions of the lymphoid system. Specifically, hypo-methylated anti-inflammatory genes found for severe UC were IL10, SIGLEC5, CD86, CLMP and members of inflammasomes NLRP3 and NLRC4. Hypo-methylation of anti-inflammatory genes during severe UC implies an interplay between the epithelium and lamina propria in order to mitigate inflammation in the gut. The specifically DNA hypo-methylated genes found for severe UC can potentially be useful biomarkers for determining disease severity and in the development of new targeted treatment strategies for severe UC patients."
https://openalex.org/W3144856816,"Optimal vancomycin exposure is important to minimize treatment failure of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) bacteremia. We aimed to analyze the impact of initial vancomycin pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) parameters, including the initial vancomycin C trough and the area under the curve (AUC)/minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) on the outcomes of pediatric MRSA bacteremia. The study population consisted of hospitalized children aged between 2 months and 18 years with MRSA bacteremia, in whom C trough was measured at least one time within the time period of January 2010 to March 2018. Demographic profiles, underlying diseases, and clinical/microbiological outcomes were abstracted retrospectively. During the study period, 73 cases of MRSA bacteremia occurred in children with a median age of 12.4 months. Severe clinical outcomes leading to intensive care unit stay and/or use of mechanical ventilation occurred in 47.5% (35/73); all-cause 30-day mortality was 9.7% (7/72). The median dosage of vancomycin was 40.0 mg/kg/day. There was a weak linear relationship between C trough and the corresponding AUC/MIC ( r = 0.235). ROC curves for achieving an AUC/MIC of 300 suggested that the initial C trough at 10 μg/mL could be used as a cut-off value with a sensitivity of 90.5% and a specificity of 44%. Although persistent bacteremia at 48–72 hours after vancomycin administration was observed more frequently when the initial C trough was &lt; 10 μg/mL and initial AUC/MIC was &lt; 300, initial AUC/MIC &lt; 300 was the only risk factor associated with persistent bacteremia at 48–72 hours (adjusted OR 3.05; 95% CI, 1.07–8.68). Initial C trough and AUC/MIC were not associated with 30-day mortality. Although there was a weak relationship between C trough and AUC/MIC, initial AUC/MIC &lt; 300 could be used as a predictor of persistent MRSA bacteremia at 48–72 hours. Further prospective data on optimal vancomycin dosing are necessary to improve clinical and microbiological outcomes in pediatric MRSA bacteremia."
https://openalex.org/W3146182553,"International scientific collaborations have always been regarded as critical actions to address global pandemics, however, there was an obvious uncertainty between international collaboration and the COVID-19 control. We aim to combine digital data-based strategies to produce meaningful and advanced insights into the imbalance between COVID-19 and international collaboration, as well as reveal possible influencing factors, and ultimately enhance global collaboration. We conducted three retrospective cohort studies using respectively COVID-19 data from WHO, a complete dataset of scientific publications on coronavirus-related research from WoS, and daily data from Google Trends (GT). The results of geovisualization and spatiotemporal analysis revealed that the global COVID19 pandemic still remains serious. The global issue of imbalance between international collaborations and pandemic does exit, and the nations with good pandemic control had their own characteristics in above-mentioned correlation. Digital epidemiology provides, at least in part, evidence-based assessment and scientific advice to understand the imbalance between international collaborations and COVID-19. Our investigation demonstrates that transdisciplinary conversation through digital data-based strategies can help us fully understand the complex factors influencing the effectiveness of international scientific collaboration, thus facilitating the global response to COVID-19."
https://openalex.org/W3147401849,"Two experiments tested whether the Dutch possessive pronoun zijn ‘his’ gives rise to a gender inference and thus causes a male bias when used generically in sentences such as Everyone was putting on his shoes . Experiment 1 ( N = 120, 48 male) was a conceptual replication of a previous eye-tracking study that had not found evidence of a male bias. The results of the current eye-tracking experiment showed the generically-intended masculine pronoun to trigger a gender inference and cause a male bias, but for male participants and in stereotypically neutral stereotype contexts only. No evidence for a male bias was thus found in stereotypically female and male context nor for female participants altogether. Experiment 2 ( N = 80, 40 male) used the same stimuli as Experiment 1, but employed the sentence evaluation paradigm. No evidence of a male bias was found in Experiment 2. Taken together, the results suggest that the generically-intended masculine pronoun zijn ‘his’ can cause a male bias for male participants even when the referents are previously introduced by inclusive and grammatically gender-unmarked iedereen ‘everyone’. This male bias surfaces with eye-tracking, which taps directly into early language processing, but not in offline sentence evaluations. Furthermore, the results suggest that the intended generic reading of the masculine possessive pronoun zijn ‘his’ is more readily available for women than for men."
https://openalex.org/W3149113590,"Bacteria play an integral role in shaping plant growth and development. However, the genetic factors that facilitate plant-bacteria interactions remain largely unknown. Here, we demonstrated the importance of two bacterial genetic factors that facilitate the interactions between plant-growth-promoting (PGP) bacteria in the genus Caulobacter and the host plant Arabidopsis . Using homologous recombination, we disrupted the cytochrome ubiquinol oxidase ( cyo ) operon in both C . vibrioides CB13 and C . segnis TK0059 by knocking out the expression of cyoB (critical subunit of the cyo operon) and showed that the mutant strains were unable to enhance the growth of Arabidopsis . In addition, disruption of the cyo operon, metabolomic reconstructions, and pH measurements suggested that both elevated cyoB expression and acid production by strain CB13 contribute to the previously observed inhibition of Arabidopsis seed germination. We also showed that the crescent shape of the PGP bacterial strain C . crescentus CB15 contributes to its ability to enhance plant growth. Thus, we have identified specific genetic factors that explain how select Caulobacter strains interact with Arabidopsis plants."
https://openalex.org/W3142324626,"Given the solid evidence that prolonged strenuous exercise is a cause of metabolic stress, this study sought to determine whether a 12-h run would affect total oxidant status (TOS), total oxidant capacity (TOC), total antioxidant status (TAS), high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) and the biomarkers of intestinal permeability (protein fatty acid-binding proteins (I-FABP) and zonulin) in middle-aged male subjects. Ten amateur long-distance runners (aged 52.0 ± 6.2 years, body height 176.9 ± 4.9 cm, body mass 73.9 ± 6.0 kg) were enrolled in the study. The venous blood samples were collected 1 hour before and right after the run and were analyzed for the levels of TAS, TOS/TOC, hs-CRP, I-FABP and zonulin. The post-run concentrations of TOS/TOC were significantly elevated (p &lt; 0.001), but TAS changes were not significant. Pearson’s correlation coefficients calculated for the post run values of TAS and TOS/TOC were statistically significant and negative (r = -0.750, p &lt; 0.05). Significant increases in the concentrations of hs-CRP (p &lt; 0.001), I-FABP (p &lt; 0.05) and zonulin (p &lt; 0.01) were noted. The results indicate that a strenuous 12-h run disturbs the prooxidant-antioxidant balance in middle-aged men, as well as promoting inflammation and impairing intestinal permeability."
https://openalex.org/W3148524117,"Academic institutions need to maintain publication lists for thousands of faculty and other scholars. Automated tools are essential to minimize the need for direct feedback from the scholars themselves who are practically unable to commit necessary effort to keep the data accurate. In relying exclusively on clustering techniques, author disambiguation applications fail to satisfy key use cases of academic institutions. Algorithms can perfectly group together a set of publications authored by a common individual, but, for them to be useful to an academic institution, they need to programmatically and recurrently map articles to thousands of scholars of interest en masse . Consistent with a savvy librarian’s approach for generating a scholar’s list of publications, identity-driven authorship prediction is the process of using information about a scholar to quantify the likelihood that person wrote certain articles. ReCiter is an application that attempts to do exactly that. ReCiter uses institutionally-maintained identity data such as name of department and year of terminal degree to predict which articles a given scholar has authored. To compute the overall score for a given candidate article from PubMed (and, optionally, Scopus), ReCiter uses: up to 12 types of commonly available, identity data; whether other members of a cluster have been accepted or rejected by a user; and the average score of a cluster. In addition, ReCiter provides scoring and qualitative evidence supporting why particular articles are suggested. This context and confidence scoring allows curators to more accurately provide feedback on behalf of scholars. To help users to more efficiently curate publication lists, we used a support vector machine analysis to optimize the scoring of the ReCiter algorithm. In our analysis of a diverse test group of 500 scholars at an academic private medical center, ReCiter correctly predicted 98% of their publications in PubMed."
https://openalex.org/W3116044379,"Since ionizing radiation has showed the dramatic effect to kill the cancer cells through direct DNA damage as well as triggering anti-cancer immune responses including induction of NKG2D ligands, it has used for long time to treat many cancer patients. However, it has been known that radiotherapy might promote the remnant cancer cells to escape immune system and metastasis. One of the suggested ways of immune evasion is induction of a ligand for programmed death-1 (PD-L1) in head and neck cancer, bladder cancer and lung cancer cells which engages the receptor, programmed death-1 (PD-1) in immune cells. PD-1/PD-L1 axis transduces the inhibitory signal and suppresses the adaptive immunity. However, their role in innate immunity remains poorly understood. Therefore, we investigated whether ionizing radiation could change the expression of PD-L1 in malignant melanoma cells and the receptor, programmed death-1 (PD-1), in NK-92 cells. Surface PD-L1 levels on melanoma cells were increased by ionizing radiation in a dose-independent manner but the level of PD-L1 was not changed significantly in NK-92 cells. Radiation-induced PD-L1 suppressed the activity of the NK-92 cells against melanoma cells despite of upregulation of NKG2D ligands. Furthermore, activated NK cells had high level of PD-1 and could not kill PD-L1+ melanoma cells effectively. When we used PD-L1 inhibitor or silenced PD-L1 gene, inhibited PD-1/PD-L1 axis reversed the activity of the suppressed NK cells. Through these results, we supposed that PD-1/PD-L1 blockade could enhance the immune responses of NK cells against melanoma cells after radiotherapy and might overcome the PD-L1 mediated radioresistance of cancer cells."
https://openalex.org/W3143274718,"The isotopic composition of inorganic carbon in otoliths ( δ 13 C oto ) can be a useful tracer of metabolic rates and a method to study ecophysiology in wild fish. We evaluated environmental and physiological sources of δ 13 C oto variation in Icelandic and Northeast Arctic (NEA) cod ( Gadus morhua ) over the years 1914–2013. Individual annual growth increments of otoliths formed at age 3 and 8 were micromilled and measured by isotope-ratio mass spectrometry. Simultaneously, all annual increment widths of the otoliths were measured providing a proxy of fish somatic growth. We hypothesized that changes in the physiological state of the organism, reflected by the isotopic composition of otoliths, can affect the growth rate. Using univariate and multivariate mixed-effects models we estimated conditional correlations between carbon isotopic composition and growth of fish at different levels (within individuals, between individuals, and between years), controlling for intrinsic and extrinsic effects on both otolith measurements. δ 13 C oto was correlated with growth within individuals and between years, which was attributed to the intrinsic effects (fish age or total length). There was no significant correlation between δ 13 C oto and growth between individuals, which suggests that caution is needed when interpreting δ 13 C oto signals. We found a significant decrease in δ 13 C oto through the century which was explained by the oceanic Suess effect-admixture of isotopically light carbon from fossil fuel. We calculated the proportion of the respired carbon in otolith carbonate ( C resp ) using carbon isotopic composition in diet and dissolved inorganic carbon of the seawater. This approach allowed us to correct the values for each stock in relation to these two environmental baselines. C resp was on average 0.275 and 0.295 in Icelandic and NEA stock, respectively. Our results provide an insight into the physiological basis for differences in growth characteristics between these two cod stocks, and how that may vary over time."
https://openalex.org/W3145608172,"Persistent or recurrent renal hyperparathyroidism may occur after total parathyroidectomy and transcervical thymectomy with forearm autograft under continuous stimulation due to uremia. Parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels may reflect persistent or recurrent renal hyperparathyroidism because of the enlarged autografted parathyroid glands in the forearm or remnant parathyroid glands in the neck or mediastinum. Detailed imaging requires predictive localization of causative parathyroid glands. Casanova and simplified Casanova tests may be convenient. However, these methods require avascularization of the autografted forearm for &gt;10 min with a tourniquet or Esmarch. The heavy pressure during avascularization can be incredibly painful and result in nerve damage. An easier method that minimizes the burden on patients in addition to predicting the localization of causative parathyroid glands was developed in this study. Ninety patients who underwent successful re-parathyroidectomy for persistent or recurrent renal hyperparathyroidism after parathyroidectomy between January 2000 and July 2019 were classified according to the localization of causative parathyroid glands (63 and 27 patients in the autografted forearm and the neck or mediastinum groups, respectively). Preoperatively, intact PTH levels were measured from bilateral forearm blood samples following a 5-min avascularization of the autografted forearm. Cutoff values of the intact PTH ratio (intact PTH level obtained from the non-autografted forearm before re-parathyroidectomy/intact PTH level obtained from the autografted forearm before re-parathyroidectomy) were investigated with receiver operating characteristic curves to localize the causative parathyroid glands. Intact PTH ratios of &lt;0.310 with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.913 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.856–0.970; P &lt; 0.001) and &gt;0.859 with an AUC 0.744 (95% CI: 0.587–0.901; P = 0.013) could predict causative parathyroid glands in the autografted forearm and the neck or mediastinum with diagnostic accuracies of 81.1% and 83.3%, respectively. Therefore, we propose that the intact PTH ratio is useful for predicting the localization of causative parathyroid glands for re-parathyroidectomy."
https://openalex.org/W3147161883,"CD40 expressed on stimulatory dendritic cells (DC) provides an important accessory signal for induction of effector T cell responses. It is also expressed at lower levels on regulatory DC (DCreg), but there is little evidence that CD40 signaling contributes to the tolerogenic activity of these cells. Indeed, CD40 silencing within DCreg has been reported to induce T cell tolerance in multiple disease models, suggesting that CD40 is superfluous to DC-induced tolerance. We critically assessed whether CD40 does have a role in tolerance induced by IL-10-differentiated DC (DC10) by using DC10 generating from the bone marrow of wild-type (w.t.) or CD40 -/- donor mice, or IL-10-complemented CD40 -/- DC10 to treat asthmatic mice. Wild-type DC10 ablated the OVA-asthma phenotype via induction of Foxp3 + Treg responses, but CD40 -/- DC10 had no discernible effects on primary facets of the phenotype (e.g., IL-5, IL-9, IL-13 levels, IgE &amp; IgG1 antibodies; p&gt;0.05) and were ≤40% effective in reversal of others. Foxp3 + T cells from the lungs of CD40 -/- DC10-treated mice expressed reduced levels of a panel of six Treg-specific activation markers relative to Treg from w.t. DC10-treated mice. Coculture with effector T cells from asthmatic mice induced a marked upregulation of cell surface CD40 on w.t. DC10. While untreated CD40 -/- and w.t. DC10 secreted equally low levels of IL-10, stimulation of w.t. DC10 with anti-CD40 for 72 h increased their expression of IL-10 by ≈250%, with no parallel induction of IL-12. Complementing IL-10 expression in CD40 -/- DC10 by IL-10 mRNA transfection fully restored the cells’ abilities to suppress the asthma phenotype. In summary, CD40 signaling in DC10 contributes importantly to their expression of IL-10 and to a robust induction of tolerance, including activation of induced Treg."
https://openalex.org/W3147966394,"Rapid warming and sea-level rise are predicted to be major driving forces in shaping coastal ecosystems and their services in the next century. Though forecasts of the multiple and complex effects of temperature and sea-level rise on ecological interactions suggest negative impacts on parasite diversity, the effect of long term climate change on parasite dynamics is complex and unresolved. Digenean trematodes are complex life cycle parasites that can induce characteristic traces on their bivalve hosts and hold potential to infer parasite host-dynamics through time and space. Previous work has demonstrated a consistent association between sea level rise and increasing prevalence of trematode traces, but a number of fundamental questions remain unanswered about this paleoecological proxy. Here we examine the relationships of host size, shape, and functional morphology with parasite prevalence and abundance, how parasites are distributed across hosts, and how all of these relationships vary through time, using the bivalve Chamelea gallina from a Holocene shallow marine succession in the Po coastal plain. Trematode prevalence increased and decreased in association with the transition from a wave-influenced estuarine system to a wave-dominated deltaic setting. Prevalence and abundance of trematode pits are associated with large host body size, reflecting ontogenetic accumulation of parasites, but temporal trends in median host size do not explain prevalence trends. Ongoing work will test the roles of temperature, salinity, and nutrient availability on trematode parasitism. Parasitized bivalves in one sample were shallower burrowers than their non-parasitized counterparts, suggesting that hosts of trematodes can be more susceptible to their predators, though the effect is ephemeral. Like in living parasite-host systems, trematode-induced malformations are strongly aggregated among hosts, wherein most host individuals harbor very few parasites while a few hosts have many. We interpret trace aggregation to support the assumption that traces are a reliable proxy for trematode parasitism in the fossil record."

We identified how funding source, disorders studied, treatments studied, and trial design changed over the past decade in US pediatric mental health clinical trials. We identified all US pediatric interventional mental health trials submitted to ClinicalTrials.gov between October 1, 2007 and April 30, 2018 (n = 1,019) and manually characterized disorders and treatments studied. We assessed trial growth and design characteristics by funding source, treatments, and disorders. US pediatric mental health trials grew over the past decade (compound annual growth rate [CAGR] 4.1%). The number of studies funded by industry and US government remained unchanged, whereas studies funded by other sources (e.g., academic medical centers) grew (CAGR 11.3%). Neurodevelopmental disorders comprised the largest proportion of disorders studied, and Non- DSM-5 ( Diagnostic and Statistical Manual-5 ) conditions was the only disorder category to grow (14.5% to 24.6%; first half to second half of decade). There was significant growth of trials studying non-psycho/pharmacotherapy treatments (33.8% to 49.0%) and a decline in trials studying pharmacotherapies (31.7% to 20.6%), though these trends differed by funding source. There were also notable differences in funding sources and treatments studied within each disorder category. Trials using double blinding declined (26.2% to 18.0%). Limitations include that ClinicalTrials.gov is not an exhaustive list of US clinical trials, and trends identified may in part reflect changes in trial registration rather than changes in clinical research. Nevertheless, ClinicalTrials.gov is among the largest databases available for evaluating trends and patterns in pediatric mental health research that might otherwise remain unassessable. Understanding these trends can guide researchers and funding bodies when considering the trajectory of the field."

We calculated the benefit of the SI course using multiple linear regression to control for students’ level of high school physics and math preparation. We found that the SI course had a significant positive effect on student performance in E&amp;M, but that an SI course with a nearly identical format had no effect on student performance in mechanics. We explored several different potential explanations for why this might be the case and were unable to find any that could explain this difference.

https://openalex.org/W3146579724,"Background Isoniazid preventive therapy (IPT) against tuberculosis (TB) is a life-saving intervention for people living with HIV (PLHIV). In September 2017, Malawi began programmatic scale-up of IPT to eligible PLHIV in five districts with high HIV and TB burden. We measured the frequency and timeliness of early-phase IPT implementation to inform quality-improvement processes. Methods and findings We applied a two-stage cluster design with systematic, probability-proportional-to-size sampling of six U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)-affiliated antiretroviral therapy (ART) centers operating in the urban areas of Lilongwe and Blantyre, Malawi (November 2017). ART clinic patient volume determined cluster size. Within each cluster, we sequentially sampled approximately 50 PLHIV newly enrolled in ART care. We described a quality-of-care cascade for intensive TB case finding (ICF) and IPT in PLHIV. PLHIV newly enrolled in ART care were eligibility-screened for hepatitis and peripheral neuropathy, as well as for TB disease using a standardized four-symptom screening tool. Among eligible PLHIV, the overall weighted IPT initiation rate was 70% (95% CI: 46%–86%). Weighted IPT initiation among persons aged &lt;15 years (30% [95% CI: 12%–55%]) was significantly lower than among persons aged ≥15 years (72% [95% CI: 47%–89%]; Rao-Scott chi-square P = 0.03). HIV-positive children aged &lt;5 years had a weighted initiation rate of only 13% (95% CI: 1%–79%). For pregnant women, the weighted initiation rate was 67% (95% CI: 32%–90%), similar to non-pregnant women aged ≥15 years (72% [95% CI: 49%–87%]). Lastly, 95% (95% CI: 92%–97%) of eligible PLHIV started ART within one week of HIV diagnosis, and 92% (95% CI: 73%–98%) of patients receiving IPT began on the same day as ART. Conclusions Early-phase IPT uptake among adults at ART centers in Malawi was high. Child uptake needed improvement. National programs could adapt this framework to evaluate their ICF-IPT care cascades."

However, less is known about the moderating mechanisms underlying these associations. The present study tested whether the stress sensitization and stress inoculation hypotheses could be applied to the relationship between early adversity and personality in adulthood. Specifically, we tested the linear and curvilinear relations between early adversity (measured retrospectively) and adulthood personality traits, as well as the linear and curvilinear moderating effects of early adversity on the associations between adulthood stress and personality traits. Samples of older adults from the Health and Retirement Study (HRS; N = 6098) and middle-aged adults from the Midlife in the United States Survey (MIDUS; N = 6186) were used. Across the two samples, positive linear associations were found between retrospective early adversity and neuroticism. The results also suggested significant linear effects of early adversity on the association between ongoing chronic stressors and neuroticism such that individuals with moderate exposure to early adversity showed stronger associations between ongoing chronic stressors and neuroticism. Results from the current research were more in line with the stress sensitization model. No support was found for the stress inoculation effects on personality."

https://openalex.org/W3151564045,"Anterior temporal lobectomy (ATL) is the most common surgical treatment for drug-resistant temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE). Right ATL has been reported to reduce facial memory ability in patients with TLE, as indicated by poor performance on the Warrington Recognition Memory Test for Faces (RMF), which is commonly used to evaluate visual memory in these patients. However, little is known about whether patients with TLE exhibit difficulties in identifying faces in daily life after ATL. The aim of this study was to investigate facial memory ability and self-awareness of face identification difficulties in patients with TLE after ATL. Sixteen patients with TLE after right ATL, 14 patients with TLE after left ATL, and 29 healthy controls were enrolled in this study. We developed the multiview face recognition test (MFRT), which comprises a learning phase (one or three frontal face images without external facial feature information) and a recognition phase (frontal, oblique, or noise-masked face images). Facial memory abilities were examined in all participants using the MFRT and RMF, and self-awareness of difficulties in face identification was evaluated using the 20-item prosopagnosia index (PI20), which has been widely used to assess developmental prosopagnosia. The MFRT performance in patients with TLE after ATL was significantly worse than that in healthy controls regardless of the resected side, whereas the RMF scores in patients with TLE were significantly worse than those in healthy controls only after right ATL. The MFRT performance in patients with TLE after both left and right ATL was more influenced by working memory load than that in healthy controls. The PI20 scores revealed that patients with TLE after left ATL were aware of their difficulties in identifying faces. These findings suggest that patients with TLE not only after right ATL but also after left ATL might have difficulties in face identification."

Methods 120 eyes of 120 patients with ocular hypertension or primary open-angle glaucoma were selected from the Diagnostic Innovations in Glaucoma Study or the African Descent and Glaucoma Evaluation Study. Patients had 11 visits, separated by at least 3 months over 5 to 10 years. Each visit had rim area (RA) and mean sensitivity (MS) measurements taken within a 30-day period. The structure-function (SF) relationship was summarized using conventional and modified cross-correlation functions (CCFs), which identified the strongest absolute and positive correlation, respectively. Patients were categorized in one of the following three groups: RA and MS evolved simultaneously (lag = 0), RA preceded MS (lag&lt;0), and MS preceded RA (lag&gt;0). Lagging regression analysis was used to examine the variations of the SF relationship within groups. Results The number of participants, mean visit lag, and mean correlation (standard deviation) were, for the conventional and modified CCFs, respectively: lag = 0 [16, 0, 0.53 (0.10) and 16, 0, 0.46 (0.11)]; lag&lt;0 [50, −2.94, 0.51 (0.11) and 55, −3.45, 0.44 (0.12)], and lag&gt;0 [54, 3.35, 0.53 (0.13) and 49, 3.78, 0.45 (0.12)]. A significant difference of the visit lag relation within groups was identified using lagging regression analysis (p&lt;0.0001). Conclusions The strongest relationship between structure and function was obtained at different visit lags in different patients. This finding also suggests that the SF relationship should be addressed at the subject level when using both measurements jointly to model glaucoma progression."
https://openalex.org/W3139965494,"Aim To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of therapeutic strategies initiated at different stages of liver fibrosis using three direct-acting antivirals (DAAs), sofosbuvir-ledipasvir (SL), glecaprevir-pibrentasvir (GP), and elbasvir plus grazoprevir (E/G), for Japanese patients with chronic hepatitis C (CHC) genotype 1. Methods We created an analytical decision model reflecting the progression of liver fibrosis stages to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of alternative therapeutic strategies applied at different fibrosis stages. We compared six treatment strategies: treating all patients regardless of fibrosis stage (TA), treating individual patients with one of four treatments starting at four respective stages of liver fibrosis progression (F1S: withholding treatment at stage F0 and starting treatment from stage F1 or higher, and three successive options, F2S, F3S, and F4S), and administering no antiviral treatment (NoRx). We adopted a lifetime horizon and Japanese health insurance payers’ perspective. Results The base case analysis showed that the incremental quality-adjusted life years (QALY) gain of TA by SL, GP, and E/G compared with the strategies of starting treatments for patients with the advanced fibrosis stage, F2S, varied from 0.32 to 0.33, and the incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were US$24,320, US$18,160 and US$17,410 per QALY, respectively. On the cost-effectiveness acceptability curve, TA was most likely to be cost-effective, with the three DAAs at the willingness to pay thresholds of US$50,000. Conclusions Our results suggested that administration of DAA treatment for all Japanese patients with genotype 1 CHC regardless of their liver fibrosis stage would be cost-effective under ordinary conditions."
https://openalex.org/W3143225313,"Introduction The use of controlled hypotension during neuraxial anesthesia for joint arthroplasty is controversial. We conducted a large institutional database analysis to assess common in-hospital complications and mortality of patients undergoing primary total hip arthroplasty (THA) under controlled hypotension and neuraxial anesthesia. Methods We conducted a large retrospective case control study of 11,292 patients who underwent primary THA using neuraxial anesthesia between March 2016 and May 2019 in a single institution devoted to musculoskeletal care. The degree and duration of various mean arterial pressure (MAP) thresholds were analyzed for adjusted odds ratios with composite common severe complications (in-hospital myocardial infarction, stroke, and/or acute kidney injury) as the primary outcome. Results Sixty-eight patients developed common severe complications (0.60%). Patients with complications were older (median age 75.6 vs 64.0 years) and had a higher American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) classification (45.6% vs 17.6% ASA III). The duration of hypotension at various MAP thresholds (45 to 70 mm Hg) was not associated with increasing odds of common severe medical complications. Conclusions Controlled hypotension (ranging from 45 to 70 mmHg) for a moderate duration during neuraxial anesthesia was not associated with increased odds of common severe complications (myocardial infarction, stroke, and/or acute kidney injury) among patients receiving neuraxial anesthesia for elective THA."
https://openalex.org/W3143346170,"Diagnostic radiology is a leading cause of man-made radiation exposure to the population. It is an important factor in many epidemiological studies as variable of interest or as potential confounder. The effective dose as a risk related quantity is the most often stated patient dose. Nevertheless, there exists no comprehensive quantification model for retrospective analysis for this quantity. This paper gives a catalog of effective dose values for common and rare examinations and demonstrates how to modify the dose values to adapt them to different calendar years using a quantification concept already used for retrospective analysis of the red bone marrow dose. It covers the time period of 1946 to 1995 and allows considering technical development and different practical standards over time. For an individual dose assessment, if the dose area product is known, factors are given for most examinations to convert the dose area product into the effective dose. Additionally factors are stated for converting the effective dose into the red bone marrow dose or vice versa."
https://openalex.org/W3145392876,"Background Neurodegenerative diseases are sporadic hereditary conditions characterized by progressive dysfunction of the nervous system. Among the symptoms, vestibulopathy is one of the causes of discomfort and a decrease in quality of life. Hereditary spastic paraplegia is a heterogeneous group of hereditary degenerative diseases involving the disorder of a single gene and is characterized by the progressive retrograde degeneration of fibers in the spinal cord. Objective To determine the benefits of vestibular rehabilitation involving virtual reality by comparing pre intervention and post intervention assessments in individuals with hereditary spastic paraplegia. Methods In this randomized controlled clinical trial from the Rebec platform RBR-3jmx67 in which allocation concealment was performed and the evaluators be blinded will be included. The participants will include 40 patients diagnosed with hereditary spastic paraplegia. The interventions will include vestibular rehabilitation with virtual reality using the Wii ® console, Wii-Remote and Wii Balance Board (Nintendo), and the studies will include pre- and post intervention assessments. Group I will include twenty volunteers who performed balance games. Group II will include twenty volunteers who performed balance games and muscle strength games. The games lasted from 30 minutes to an hour, and the sessions were performed twice a week for 10 weeks (total: 20 sessions). Results This study provides a definitive assessment of the effectiveness of a virtual reality vestibular rehabilitation program in halting the progression of hereditary spastic paraplegia, and this treatment can be personalized and affordable. Conclusion The study will determine whether a vestibular rehabilitation program with the Nintendo Wii ® involving virtual reality can reduce the progressive effect of hereditary spastic paraplegia and serve as an alternative treatment option that is accessible and inexpensive. Rebec platform trial: RBR-3JMX67."
https://openalex.org/W3146414094,"Objectives To determine whether the generic and branded warfarins used as anticoagulants in Brazil are therapeutic equivalents based on their international normalized ratio (INR) results. Methods This crossover randomized controlled trial had four periods. We used the branded Marevan and two generic versions of warfarin sodium tablets, manufactured by União Química and Teuto laboratories, all purchased from retail drugstores. Eligible participants were outpatients from an anticoagulation clinic at a university hospital in São Paulo, Brazil. They had atrial fibrillation or flutter and had been using warfarin for at least 2 months with an INR therapeutic range of 2.0–3.0. Randomization was by numbered, opaque, sealed envelopes. Healthcare personnel and outcome assessors were blinded to treatments, but patients were not. The primary outcome was the variability in the INR (ΔINR) and secondary outcomes included mean INR. We accepted formulations as equivalent if the 95% confidence interval (CI) of the comparison of ΔINR between branded and generic formulations was within the limit of ±0.49. Results One hundred patients were recruited and randomized to six sequences of treatment (four sequences with n = 17 and two sequences with n = 16). União Química generic warfarin had equivalent variability in the INR to Marevan (ΔINR +0.09 [95% CI -0.29 to +0.46], n = 84). Comparison between Teuto generic warfarin and Marevan was inconclusive (ΔINR +0.29 [95% CI -0.09 to +0.68], n = 84). Conclusions Marevan and União Química warfarin had equivalent therapeutic effectiveness and both could be confidently used for anticoagulation. The comparison between Marevan and TW was inconclusive and does not warrant a statement of equivalence. Our methods are especially important for comparing generic and branded drugs that raise concerns and may be subject of future investigations by regulatory agents.

https://openalex.org/W3151239091,"People with chronic low back pain (LBP) exhibit changes in postural control. Stereotypical muscle activations resulting from external perturbations include anticipatory (APAs) and compensatory (CPAs) postural adjustments. The aim and objective of this study was to determine differences in postural control strategies (peak amplitude, APAs and CPAs) between symptomatic and asymptomatic adults with and without Lumbar Disc Degeneration (LDD) using surface electromyography during forward postural perturbation. Ninety-seven subjects participated in the study (mean age 50 years (SD 12)). 3T MRI was used to acquire T2 weighted images (L1-S1). LDD was determined using Pfirrmann grading. A bespoke translational platform was designed to deliver horizontal perturbations in sagittal and frontal planes. Electromyographic activity was analysed bilaterally from 8 trunk and lower limb muscles during four established APA and CPA epochs. A Kruskal-Wallis H test with Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons was conducted. Four groups were identified: no LDD no pain (n = 19), LDD no pain (n = 38), LDD pain (n = 35) and no LDD pain (n = 5). There were no significant differences in age or gender between groups. The most significant difference between groups was observed during forward perturbation. In the APA and CPA phases of predictable forward perturbation there were significant differences ankle strategy between groups (p = 0.007–0.008); lateral gastrocnemius and tibialis anterior activity was higher in the LDD pain than the LDD no pain group. There were no significant differences in the unpredictable condition (p&gt;0.05). These findings were different from the remaining groups, where significant differences in hip strategy were observed during both perturbation conditions (p = 0.004–0.006). Symptomatic LDD patients exhibit different electromyographic strategies to asymptomatic LDD controls. Future LBP electromyographic research should benefit from considering assessment of both lower limbs in addition to the spine. This approach could prevent underestimation of postural control deficits and guide targeted rehabilitation."
https://openalex.org/W3151376472,"Introduction Educational attainment and employment are essential for young people to develop the skills needed to participate in society and maintain a stable connection to the labour market in adult life. The objective of this study was to examine associations between engagement in society, measured by leisure time activities and part-time work in mid and late adolescence and educational attainment and employment in early adulthood. Method A cohort of Danish young people born in 1989 was followed in a prospective study with questionnaires in 2004 (n = 3,054) and 2007 (n = 2,400) where information on leisure time activities and part-time work was collected. Information on connection to education and work was collected from a register of social benefits when participants were 25–29 years old and divided into high and low connection. The associations were examined using logistic regression and stratified by gender and childhood socioeconomic groups. Results Part-time work was, both in mid (OR: 1.7 [95% CI 1.3; 2.2]) and late (1.9 [1.4;2.6]) adolescence, positively associated with connection to education and work. Leisure time activities in mid adolescence were associated with connection to education and work (OR:1.6 [1.2;2.1]). Among men engagement in society showed strongest associations with later connection to education or work in mid adolescence (ORs up to 2.2), whereas the associations for women seemed strongest in late adolescence (ORs up to 2.8). Conclusion The study showed that adolescent engagement in society had positive associations with later educational attainment and employment, with stronger impact of part-time work compared to leisure time activities. The study identified differences between genders and the timing of engagement. Associations were consistent across socioeconomic groups."
https://openalex.org/W3142335717,"Introduction As US Hispanic populations are at higher risk than non-Hispanics for cardiovascular disease and Type 2 diabetes targeted interventions are clearly needed. This paper presents the four years results of the Vida Sana Program (VSP), which was developed and is implemented by a small clinic serving mostly Spanish-speaking, limited literacy population. Methods The eight-week course of interactive two-hour sessions taught by Navegantes , bilingual/cultural community health workers, was delivered to participants with hypertension, or high lipids, BMI, waist circumference, glucose or hemoglobin A1C (A1C). Measures, collected by Navegantes and clinic nurses, included blood chemistries, blood pressure, anthropometry, and an assessment of healthy food knowledge. Results Most participants (67%) were female, Hispanic (95%), and all were 18 to 70 years of age. At baseline, close to half of participants were obese (48%), had high waist circumference (53%), or elevated A1C (52%), or fasting blood glucose (57%). About one third had high blood pressure (29%) or serum cholesterol (35%), and 22% scored low on the knowledge assessment. After the intervention, participants decreased in weight (-1.0 lb), BMI (-0.2 kg/m2), WC (-0.4 inches), and cholesterol (-3.5 mg/dl, all p&lt;0.001). Systolic blood pressure decreased (-1.7 mm Hg, p&lt;0.001), and the knowledge score increased (6.8 percent, p&lt;0.001). Discussion VSP shows promising improvements in metabolic outcomes, similar to other programs with longer duration or higher intensity interventions. VSP demonstrates an important model for successful community-connected interventions."
https://openalex.org/W3149341473,"This study aimed to analyze fracture strength in vitro by varying the axial height of the titanium insert and the labial height of the zirconia abutment in an internal connection implant to identify the titanium insert axial height with optimal mechanical stability. Sixty implants with an internal connection system were used. Two-piece zirconia abutments were used with the titanium inserts. Combinations of different titanium insert axial heights (mm) and zirconia abutment labial heights (mm) constituted five groups: Gr1 (1–3), Gr2 (3–3), Gr3 (3–5), Gr4 (5–3), and Gr5 (5–5). After thermocycling, a fracture load test was performed with a universal testing machine. The initial deformation load and the fracture load were measured and analyzed. The fractured surface and cross-section of the specimens were examined by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The groups of titanium inserts with axial heights of 3 mm and 5 mm showed significantly greater initial deformation load and fracture load than the group with an axial height of 1 mm ( p &lt; 0.05), but there was no significant difference between the two groups with axial heights of 3 mm and 5 mm. The labial height of the zirconia abutment had no significant influence on the initial deformation load and fracture load. In some specimens in Gr4 and Gr5, cracking or bending of the titanium insert and abutment screw was observed on SEM. The axial height of the titanium insert should be designed to not be less than 3 mm to increase the fracture strength and promote the long-term stability of implants."
