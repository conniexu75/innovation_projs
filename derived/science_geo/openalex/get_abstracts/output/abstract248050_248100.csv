Signals penetrate the polar layered deposits, probably imaging the base of the deposits. Data from the northern lowlands of Chryse Planitia have revealed a shallowly buried quasi-circular structure about 250 kilometers in diameter that is interpreted to be an impact basin. In addition, a planar reflector associated with the basin structure may indicate the presence of a low-loss deposit that is more than 1 kilometer thick."

Human beta-defensin-2 (hBD-2) is an antimicrobial peptide induced in various epithelia upon extracellular as well as intracellular bacterial challenge. Nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain protein 2 (NOD2/CARD15) is a cytosolic protein involved in intracellular recognition of microbes by sensing peptidoglycan fragments (e.g. muramyl dipeptide). We used luciferase as a reporter gene for a 2.3-kb hBD-2 promoter to test the hypothesis that NOD2 mediates the induction of hBD-2. Activation of NOD2 in NOD2-overexpressing human embryonic kidney 293 cells through its ligand muramyl dipeptide (MDP) induced hBD-2 expression. In contrast, overexpression of NOD2 containing the 3020insC frame-shift mutation, the most frequent NOD2 variant associated with Crohn disease, resulted in defective induction of hBD-2 through MDP. Luciferase gene reporter analyses and site-directed mutagenesis experiments demonstrated that functional binding sites for NF-κB and AP-1 in the hBD-2 promoter are required for NOD2-mediated induction of hBD-2 through MDP. Moreover, the NF-κB inhibitor Helenalin as well as a super-repressor form of the NF-κB inhibitor IκB strongly inhibited NOD2-mediated hBD-2 promoter activation. Expression of NOD2 was detected in primary keratinocytes, and stimulation of these cells with MDP induced hBD-2 peptide release. In contrast, small interference RNA-mediated down-regulation of NOD2 expression in primary keratinocytes resulted in a defective induction of hBD-2 upon MDP treatment. Together, these data suggest that NOD2 serves as an intracellular pattern recognition receptor to enhance host defense by inducing the production of antimicrobial peptides such as hBD-2.

Human epithelia are in permanent contact with various potential pathogenic microorganisms. To overcome these microbial threats, epithelia have developed a chemical defense system based on the production of various antimicrobial proteins (1Boman H.G. J. Intern.

Bartels J. Christophers E. Schroeder J.M. Nature. 1997; 387: 861Crossref PubMed Scopus (1182) Google Scholar). hBD-2 belongs to the beta-defensin family, a group of small (4–5 kDa), cationic antibiotic peptides first discovered in cattle (6Diamond G.

Following a bacterial infection, mice with hBD-2-bearing tumors bore fewer viable bacteria than controls (7Huang G.T. Zhang H.B. Kim D. Liu L. Ganz T. Hum. Gene Ther. 2002; 13: 2017-2025Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). In addition to its capacity to serve as an antibiotic peptide, hBD-2 may promote adaptive immune responses by recruiting dendritic and T cells to the site of microbial invasion through interaction with CCR6 (8Yang D. Chertov O. Bykovskaia S.N. Chen Q. Buffo M.J. Shogan J. Anderson M. Schroeder J.M. Wang J.M. Howard O.M. Oppenheim J.J. Science. 1999; 286: 525-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (1512) Google Scholar). Furthermore hBD-2 was found to be a specific chemoattractant for tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α)-treated human neutrophils (9Niyonsaba F. Ogawa H. Nagaoka I.

NOD2 was found to be expressed in antigen-presenting cells such as monocytes/macrophages, but more recent studies have also revealed abundant presence of NOD2 in epithelial Paneth cells of the small intestine as well as in other epithelial cells (28Ogura Y.

Our findings suggest that activation of NOD2 in epithelial cells may strengthen epithelial innate immunity through the induction of antimicrobial peptides.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCulture of Epithelial Cells—HEK293 cells and primary keratinocytes were cultured in 75-cm2 flasks (BD Biosciences) in a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO2. Standard medium for feeding of HEK293 cells consisted of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 10% fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 2 mm glutamine. Foreskin-derived primary keratinocytes were isolated from neonatal foreskins as described (38Wiedow O. Harder J. Bartels J. Streit V. Christophers E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 248: 904-909Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar) and cultured in Epilife medium (Sigma). For stimulation experiments cells were seeded in 12-well tissue culture plates (4 cm2/well; BD Biosciences) and used at 60–80% confluence.RNA Isolation and cDNA Synthesis—After treatment cells were washed twice with PBS and harvested using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) according to the supplier's protocol. RNA quality and quantity were determined by gel electrophoresis and photometry. Subsequently 1 μg of total RNA was reverse transcribed to cDNA with oligo(dT) primers and 200 units of Superscript II (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol.Real-time Reverse Transcription PCR—Real-time reverse transcription-PCR analyses were performed in a fluorescence temperature cycler (LightCycler; Roche Diagnostics) as described previously (12Harder J. Meyer-Hoffert U. Wehkamp K. Schwichtenberg L. Schroeder J.M. J. Investig. Dermatol. 2004; 123: 522-529Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). This technique continuously monitors the cycle-by-cycle accumulation of fluorescently labeled PCR product. Briefly, cDNA corresponding to 10 ng of RNA served as a template in a 10-μl reaction containing 4 mm MgCl2, 0.5 μm of each primer, and 1× LightCycler-FastStart DNA Master SYBR Green I mix (Roche Diagnostics). Samples were loaded into capillary tubes and incubated in the fluorescence thermocycler (LightCycler) for an initial denaturation at 95 °C for 10 min followed by 45 cycles, each cycle consisting of 95 °C for 15 s, 60 °C (touchdown of –1 °C/cycle from 66 to 60 °C) for 5 s and 72 °C for 10 s. At the end of each run melting curve profiles were produced by cooling the sample to 65 °C for 15 s and then heating slowly at 0.20 °C/s up to 95 °C with continuous measurement of fluorescence to confirm amplification of specific transcripts. Cycle-to-cycle fluorescence emission readings were monitored and analyzed using LightCycler software (Roche Diagnostics). The specificity of the amplification products was further verified by subjecting the amplification products to electrophoresis on a 2% agarose gel. The fragments were visualized by ethidium bromide staining, and the specificity of PCR products was verified by sequencing of representative samples. The following intron-spanning primers were used: hBD-2, 5′-ATCAGCCATGAGGGTCTTGT-3′ (forward primer) and 5′-GAGACCACAGGTGCCAATTT-3′ (reverse primer); NOD2, 5′-AGCCATTGTCAGGAGGCTC-3′ (forward primer) and 5′-CGTCTCTGCTCCATCATAGG-3′ (reverse primer); NOD1, 5′-CAACGATGAAGTGGCAGAGA-3′ (forward primer) and 5′-ACTTTGGCCTCCTCTGGTTT-3′ (reverse primer); glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, 5′-CCAGCCGAGCCACATCGCTC-3′ (forward primer) and 5′-ATGAGCCCCAGCCTTCTCCAT-3′. Standard curves were obtained for each primer set with serial dilutions of cDNA. All quantifications were normalized to the housekeeping gene glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. Relative expression is given as a ratio between target gene expression and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase expression.ELISA—For ELISA, 96-well immunoplates (MaxiSorp™; Nunc, Roskilde, Denmark) were coated at 4 °C for 20 h with 50 μl of goat anti-hBD-2 antibody (PeproTech, Rocky Hill, NJ) diluted 1:500 to 1 μg/ml in 0.05 m carbonate buffer, pH 9.6. Subsequently, wells were blocked with 200 μl of 1% bovine serum albumin in PBS for 10 min at room temperature. After washing three times with 200 μl of PBS + 0.1% Tween 20, 100 μl/well of cell culture supernatants and serial dilutions of natural skin-derived hBD-2 in cell culture medium were incubated for 30 min at room temperature. Plates were washed three times with PBS + 0.1% Tween 20, and wells were incubated for 30 min at room temperature with 50 μl of biotinylated goat anti-hBD-2 antibody (Cell Concepts) diluted 1:2500 to 0.2 μg/ml in PBS + 0.1% Tween 20. Plates were washed again three times with PBS + 0.1% Tween and filled with 50 μl/well of Streptavidin-POD (Roche Diagnostics; 1:10000 in PBS + 0.1% Tween 20). The plates were then incubated for 30 min at room temperature, washed three times as described above, and incubated with the development agent 2,2′-azino-bis-3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulfonic acid (ABTS; Roche Diagnostics) for 15 min at room temperature in the dark. Absorbance was measured at 405 nm with a multichannel photometer (Sunrise; Tecan, Crailsheim, Germany).NOD2 Expression Plasmid Construction—The complete cDNA of NOD2 was cloned into the expression vector pEF6/V5-His (Invitrogen). The resulting NOD2-overexpressing plasmid (NOD2-pEF6/V5-His) was verified by sequencing. The QuikChange™ XL site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) was used as indicated by the supplier for the introduction of the 3020InsC mutation in the NOD2 expression plasmid NOD2-pEF6/V5-His. The resulting plasmid carrying the NOD2 3020InsC mutation (NOD2–3020InsC-pEF6/V5-His) was verified by sequencing.Western Blot—HEK293 cells were harvested in lysis buffer (1% Triton X-100 in PBS + protease inhibitor mixture; Roche Diagnostics) and lysed by sonication. After centrifugation (10,000 × g, 15 min), the resulting supernatant was mixed with 4× NuPAGE LDS sample buffer (Invitrogen), and 30 μg of this cell extract was separated onto a NuPAGE 4–12% Bis-Tris gel (Invitrogen). To analyze NOD2 protein expression in primary keratinocytes, 2 × 106 cells were immunoprecipitated with 1 μl of NOD2-specific rabbit antiserum (Cayman Chemical, Ann Arbor, MI) (28Ogura Y. Inohara N. Benito A. Chen F.F. Yamaoka S. Nunez G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 4812-4818Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1159) Google Scholar) using the immunoprecipitation kit (Protein G; Roche Diagnostics) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Immunoprecipitated proteins were resolved in NuPAGE LDS sample buffer (Invitrogen) and separated onto a NuPAGE 4–12% Bis-Tris gel (Invitrogen). Proteins were transferred to a Protran-nitrocellulose membrane (Schleicher & Schuell BioScience), blocked for 1 h in blocking buffer (5% (w/v) nonfat powdered milk in PBS + 0.05% Tween), and then incubated for 18 h at 4 °C in 3% (w/v) nonfat powdered milk in PBS + 0.05% Tween containing 1:4000 NOD2-specific rabbit antiserum (Cayman, MI) (28Ogura Y. Inohara N. Benito A. Chen F.F. Yamaoka S. Nunez G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 4812-4818Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1159) Google Scholar). The membrane was washed with PBS + 0.05% Tween six times for 5 min each and then incubated for 1 h in 3% (w/v) nonfat powdered milk in PBS + 0.05% Tween containing 1:20,000 dilution of goat anti-rabbit IgG horseradish peroxidase conjugate (Dianova, Hamburg, Germany). After another six washes, the membrane was incubated for 5 min with chemiluminescent peroxidase substrate (Sigma) and visualized using a Diana III cooled CCD camera imaging system (Raytest, Straubenhardt, Germany).hBD-2 Reporter Plasmid Construction—A 2338-bp-containing fragment of the hBD-2 promoter was subcloned into the promoterless pGL3-basic firefly luciferase vector (Promega, Madison, WI) to generate reporter plasmid hBD-2–2338-luc as previously described (23Wehkamp J. Harder J. Wehkamp K. Wehkamp-von Meissner B. Schlee M. Enders C. Sonnenborn U. Nuding S. Bengmark S. Fellermann K. Schroeder J.M. Stange E.F. Infect. Immun. 2004; 72: 5750-5758Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar). Generation of mutations in the NF-κB and AP-1 binding sites of the hBD-2–2338-luc plasmid was described elsewhere (23Wehkamp J. Harder J. Wehkamp K. Wehkamp-von Meissner B. Schlee M. Enders C. Sonnenborn U. Nuding S. Bengmark S. Fellermann K. Schroeder J.M. Stange E.F. Infect. Immun. 2004; 72: 5750-5758Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar). The resulting hBD-2–2338-luc plasmids containing mutated NF-κB and AP-1 binding sites were termed NF-κB-mut1-luc (containing one mutated NF-κB binding site at position –205 to –186, Fig. 3a), NF-κB-mut2-luc (containing one mutated NF-κB binding site at position –596 to –572, Fig. 3a), NF-κB-mut1 + 2-luc (containing two mutated NF-κB binding sites, Fig. 3a), AP1-mut-luc (containing a mutated AP-1 binding site, Fig. 3a), and NF-κB-mut1 + 2 + AP-1-luc (containing two mutated NF-κB binding sites and a mutated AP-1 binding site, Fig. 3a).Transfection and Determination of hBD-2 Promoter and NF-κB Activation—HEK293 cells were transfected in 12-well plates (BD Biosciences) at 60–80% confluence. Luciferase-reporter plasmids for hBD-2 were generated as described above. To analyze activation of the transcription factor NF-κB the firefly luciferase reporter plasmid pNF-κB-Luc (Clontech, CA) was used. HEK293 cells were transfected for 24 h with 75 ng of the indicated reporter plasmids, 30 ng of the NOD2 expression plasmid, and 10 ng of an internal control Renilla luciferase expression plasmid (phRG-TK; Promega) using 1 μl of transfection reagent FuGENE 6 (Roche Diagnostics) according to the manufacturer's instructions. For stimulation with MDP, 1 μg of MDP (Bachem, Heidelberg, Germany) was added at the same time. 24 h after transfection cells were harvested with 500 μl of passive lysis buffer (Promega), and firefly luciferase activity from hBD-2-pGL3 reporter vector and Renilla luciferase activity were measured by the dual luciferase assay system (Promega) on a TD-20/20 luminometer (Turner Designs). Promoter activity was reported as the ratio between firefly and Renilla luciferase activities in each sample. In some experiments HEK293 cells were transfected for 16 h with 0.5 μg of a plasmid (CMV-IκB-DN) allowing overexpression of a mutated IκB variant (kindly provided by Dagmar Kulms, Münster, Germany) (39Kulms D. Poppelmann B. Schwarz T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15060-15066Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar).Small Interfering RNA (siRNA)—The following duplexed RNA oligonucleotides (Stealth RNAi) were synthesized by Invitrogen: NOD2-A, 5′-UAUUGUUAUCGCGCAAAUACAGAGC-3′; NOD2-B, 5′-UGCGAGAGAACAUACACCUUCAUCC-3′. As a control, we used Stealth RNAi negative control duplexes (Invitrogen). Primary keratinocytes were cultured in 12-well plates and used at 50–70% density the day of transfection. Cells were transfected with Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen): 1 μl of siRNA stock (20 μm) and 1 μl of Lipofectamine 2000 were each diluted with 250 μl of Epilife medium without supplements. After 5 min at room temperature, they were combined and incubated for 20 min. The reaction mixtures were overlaid on the cell culture for 5 h. The medium was then changed to fresh Epilife medium. After 20 h cells were treated with the NOD2 ligand muramyl dipeptide MDP-LD (or simply MDP, purchased from Bachem) or with the biologically inactive MDP isomer MDP-LL (Bachem), where the second amino acid, d-isoglutamine is replaced by the l-isoglutamine enantiomer (36Girardin S.E.

Delivery of MDP into the cells was accomplished using the protein transfection reagent ProteoJuice (Novagen): 0.6 μl of ProteoJuice was incubated for 20 min with 50 μl of Epilife medium containing different concentrations of MDP. Subsequently, the reaction mixture was diluted with 450 μl of Epilife medium and applied to the cells. After 2.5 h the medium was replaced by fresh Epilife medium containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin, and stimulation was carried out for 7 h. Following stimulation supernatants were used for hBD-2 ELISA, and cells were used for RNA isolation as described above.RESULTSFunctional Overexpression of NOD2 in HEK293 Cells—To confirm that transfection of HEK293 cells using our NOD2 plasmid constructs leads to consistent NOD2 protein expression, a NOD2 Western blot analysis was performed. HEK293 cells transfected with the NOD2 gene as well as with the mutated NOD2 gene (3020InsC) gave a strong signal in Western blot, confirming that transfection using the NOD2 plasmid constructs results in NOD2 protein expression (Fig. 1a).FIGURE 1Functional overexpression of NOD2 in HEK293 cells. a, NOD2 Western blot of HEK293 cells transfected with NOD2 expression vector (lane 1), NOD2 3020InsC expression vector (lane 2), or empty vector (lane 3). Note the lower molecular mass of the mutated NOD2 protein (3020InsC; lane 2), which is the result of the generation of a stop codon.

To verify the efficiency of our NOD2 plasmid constructs we used these constructs to transiently transfect HEK293 cells and analyzed NF-κB activation upon MDP treatment. HEK293 cells transfected with an empty control vector did not show any NF-κB activation upon MDP treatment (Fig. 1b). The reason for this may be that the HEK293 cells express only low, if any, levels of endogenous NOD2 that are not detectable in Western blot analyses (Fig. 1a, lane 3). As shown in Fig. 1b, stimulation of NOD2-transfected HEK293 cells with MDP strongly activates NF-κB. In contrast, HEK293 cells transfected with the NOD2 gene carrying the 3020InsC mutation (a frameshift mutation encoding a truncated MDP-nonresponsive NOD2 protein that is associated with Crohn disease) (36Girardin S.E.

In mucin-type O-linked glycosylation these changes can result in the production of mucins such as MUC1, carrying shorter sialylated O-glycans, and with different site occupancy. Of the tumor-associated sialylated O-glycans, the disaccharide, sialyl-Tn (sialic acid α2,6GalNAc), is expressed by 30% of breast carcinomas and is the most tumor-specific.

In breast carcinomas, however, a complete correlation between the expression of RNA-encoding ST6GalNAc-I and the expression of sialyl-Tn is evident, demonstrating that the expression of sialyl-Tn results from switching on expression of hST6GalNAc-I. Endogenous or exogenous expression of hST6GalNAc-I (but not ST6GalNAc-II) always results in the expression of sialyl-Tn. This ability to override core 1/core 2 pathways of O- linked glycosylation is explained by the localization of ST6GalNAc-I, which is found throughout the Golgi stacks. The development of a Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell line expressing MUC1 and ST6GalNAc-I allowed the large scale production of MUC1 carrying 83% sialyl-Tn O-glycans. The presence of ST6GalNAc-I in the CHO cells reduced the number of O-glycosylation sites occupied in MUC1, from an average of 4.3 to 3.8 per tandem repeat.

Post-translational modifications of proteins can strongly affect their function. In this context it is becoming clear that glycosylation plays an important role in eukaryotes, not merely in the stabilization of proteins in vivo, but in affecting cell-cell interactions and interactions with the matrix, as well as affecting the function of intracellular molecules such as transcription factors (1Lowe J.B.

In the development of malignancy, interactions of the cancer cell with other cells and matrices in different tissues are crucially important for survival and/or metastasis and interactions with immune effector cells can affect the immune response. In this context, cancer-associated changes in the glycosylation patterns of glycoproteins that transit the Golgi pathway and are either secreted or targeted to the membrane are of particular interest. In many carcinomas that express membrane and secreted mucins, changes in mucin-type O-glycosylation have been documented (4Hakomori S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Mucin type O-glycosylation is initiated by the addition of N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc) to serines and threonines, which generates the Tn antigen, and in the normal breast chains are extended by the addition of monosaccharides through the core 1/core 2 pathways. This results in the addition of linear and branched polylactosamine side chains to the core protein of MUC1 (see Fig. 1 and Ref. 8Hanisch F.G. Uhlenbruck G. Peter-Katalinic J. Egge H. Dabrowski J.

In breast cancers and breast cancer cell lines, there is a shift toward the addition of shorter O-glycans, the degree to which this change is seen being dependent, to some extent, on the level of expression of the core 2 synthesizing enzyme, which can be totally absent (6Lloyd K.O.

In human cells, the enzyme ST6GalNAc-I has been identified as a glycosyltransferase able to add sialic acid in α2,6 linkage to GalNAc linked to serine or threonine, thus creating the STn epitope (25Ikehara Y.

The mechanisms underlying the appearance of this O-glycan are not totally clear and may vary with the tissue. One obvious mechanism is an increase in the level of activity of the enzyme(s), which adds sialic acid to GalNAc. Studies in colon carcinoma have demonstrated that this is not the case in this malignancy (32Vazquez-Martin C. Cuevas E. Gil-Martin E. Fernandez-Briera A. Oncology. 2004; 67: 159-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), because the level of α2,6-sialyltransferase enzyme activity is similar in normal and cancerous colonic tissue, whereas STn is only detectable in the cancers. The difference in colon carcinoma appears to be due to a lack of detection of the STn on most normal tissue, because of a modification of the sialic acid resulting in it not being recognized by the STn-specific antibodies. However, as we report here, although the hST6GalNAc-I mRNA, which synthesizes STn, is found in normal tissues of the gastrointestinal tract, it is not present in the normal breast. Therefore there is a strong possibility that the expression of STn in breast cancer relates to the de novo expression of hST6GalNAc-I. Here we have examined this hypothesis and find a complete correlation between the expression of the STn epitope in breast cancers and the expression of hST6GalNAc-I mRNA. Significantly, there was no correlation of STn expression with expression of hST6GalNAc-II mRNA. Transfection studies show that expression of hST6GalNAc-I can override the core 1/core 2 pathway in breast cancer cell lines and that the enzyme appears to be found throughout the Golgi. Thus stable expression of the enzyme has allowed the production of large quantities of a MUC1 glycoform carrying STn as the dominant O-glycan. Cell Culture—The breast cancer cell line T47D was cultured in E4, 10% FCS, and the E2J cell line, derived from the transfection of T47D with C2GnT-1 (13Dalziel M. Whitehouse C. McFarlane I.

For large scale production, they were adapted to serum-free medium (see below). Cloning of hST6GalNAc-I by RT-PCR—Total cellular RNA was prepared form K562 cells using TRIzol (Invitrogen) as per the manufacturer's instructions. First strand cDNA synthesis was performed with oligo(dT) primers from 3 μg of RNA in a 20-μl reaction volume using a superscript pre-amplification system (Invitrogen). The amplification of cDNA was performed with the Expand Long template PCR system (Roche Applied Science) in a total volume of 50 μl containing 0.3 μm of a primer set, 5′-GCTAGCCGACCCACCACCATGAGG-3′ (corresponding to bp (-12 to -6) of the ST6GalNAcI sequence) and 5′-CTCGAGTCAATTACCAAGACGATTCATTTCAATATCAGTATAAAGTTGACGATTGGGCGGGTTCTTGGCTTTGGCAGTTC-3′ (corresponding to bp 1761-1800 of the ST6GalNAc-I sequence).

The sequence of the 5′-primer was taken from the genomic sequence, because use of the published 5′ cDNA sequence did not result in a product. The primers were designed to generate NheI and XhoI sites at the 5′- and 3′-ends, respectively. The 3′-oligonucleotide also generates a mutated stop codon in the ST6GalNAc-I sequence followed by 2 proline residues, the vsv-g tag sequence, and a TGA stop codon. PCR buffer 1 was used at a final MgCl2 concentration of 1.75 mm. After initial denaturation for 3 min at 94 °C, 30 cycles of PCR were performed, each cycle comprising 30 s at 94 °C, 30 s at 60 °C, and 2 min at 68 °C. The PCR product was cloned into pCR2.1 using the Original TA cloning kit (Invitrogen), sequenced and subcloned into pcDNA3.1-hygro (Invitrogen) using NheI/XhoI restriction sites. Cell Transfections—Cells were transiently transfected with 2 μg of ST6GalNAc-I-vsv or ST6GalNAc-II-FLAG expression plasmids using 10 μl of the Lipofectamine reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. T47D-ST3 (12Whitehouse C. Burchell J. Gschmeissner S. Brockhausen I. Lloyd K.O. Taylor-Papadimitriou J. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 1229-1241Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) and CHO MUC1 cells were stably transfected with 30 μg of ST6GalNAc-I-vsv-g pcDNA3.1hygro vector by electroporation using the following conditions: T47D-ST3, 250 V at 960 microfarads and CHO MUC1 450 V at 250 microfarads. Three days post-transfection, cells were split 1:10 into E4, 10% FCS with 500 μg/ml G418 and 300 μg/ml hygromycin (T47D-ST3-STn) and 1:20 into Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium, 10% FCS with 600 μg/ml hygromycin, and 600 μg/ml G418 (CHO MUC1 STn). Media was changed every 3 days until selection of clones was isolated and expanded. Immunofluorescence Staining of Cultured Cells—Cells on coverslips, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min at room temperature and permeabilized by 0.1% Triton-X for 5 min at room temperature, were washed and then incubated with the mouse monoclonal antibody TKH2 (reactive with STn) or with the anti-vsv-g antibody (P5D4) for 1 h at room temperature. Following three washes in phosphate-buffered saline, rabbit anti-mouse FITC (Dako) was added for 1 h at room temperature at a dilution of 1:40. For the detection of FLAG-tagged ST6GalNAc-II expression, cells were incubated with a FITC-labeled FLAG-M2 antibody (Sigma) for 1 h at room temperature. The cells were washed, mounted in CITIFLUOR and viewed on a fluorescence microscope. Flow Cytometric Analysis—Cells were stained with monoclonal antibody SM3 (MUC1) or TKH2, 30 min on ice, washed, and incubated with FITC-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse immunoglobulins (Dako) for 30 min on ice. When biotinylated antibodies were used, binding was detected with streptavidin-FITC (Dako). For internal staining of the vsv-g tag, cells were incubated on ice with the anti-vsv-g antibody (P5D4) in 0.1% saponin for 30 min followed by FITC-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse immunoglobulins (Dako) for 30 min on ice. Cells were stained with peanut agglutinin before and after sialidase treatment as previously described (17Mungul A. Cooper L. Brockhausen I. Ryder K. Mandel U. Clausen H. Rughetti A. Miles D.W. Taylor-Papadimitriou J. Burchell J.M. Int. J. Oncol. 2004; 25: 937-943PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were fixed in 1% formaldehyde and analyzed using an XL Flow Cytometer (Beckman-Coulter, High Wycombe, UK) and WinMDA software. Dead cells were excluded on the basis of forward and side light scatter. Immunoelectron Microscopy—Cells were fixed for 1 h at room temperature in 0.1% gluteraldehyde/4% paraformaldehyde before being scraped, spun down, and stored overnight in 2% paraformaldehyde at 4 °C. The grids were incubated overnight at 4 °C with 20 μg/ml P5D4 (reactive with the vsv-g tag), followed, after washing, with rabbit anti-mouse IgG1 for 30 min. After further washing, grids were incubated at room temperature for 30 min with protein A coupled to 10-nm gold particles. The grids were embedded in 1.8% methyl cellulose/0.4% uranyl acetate before examination using a Jeol 1010 transmission electron microscope with a Gatan 2K digital camera for image capture. RT-PCR of Glycosyltransferases—The generation of cDNA was performed as described above for K562 cells. The cDNA was amplified using 2.5 units of Taq polymerase in a total volume of 50 μl. The following oligonucleotides were used for each glycosyltransferase: Core 1, β1,3-galactosyltransferase-specific primers; 5′-ACAGAAATACACTTTCGGGAAATG-3′ and 5′-TCAAGGATTTCCTAACTTCACTTTT-3′. These primers generate the full-length cDNA resulting in the amplification of a 1112-bp fragment. The C2GnT-1-specific primers used were 5′-ATGCTGAGGACGTTGCTG-3′ and 5′-TCAGTGTTTTAATGTCTCCAA-3′. These primers generate the full-length C2GnT-1 cDNA, amplifying a 1286-bp fragment. ST6GalNAcI oligonucleotides used were 5′-AAAGGAGTGACCACAGCAG-3′ and 5′-TCAGTTCTTGGCTTTGGCAGTTC-3′. These primers generate a 1155-bp fragment, which represents the message for the active full-length form of ST6GalNAc-I. The MUC1-specific oligonucleotides used were 5′-CTTGCCAGCCATAGCACCAAG-3′ and 5′-CTCCACGTCGTGGACATTGATG-3′. These primers result in the amplification of a region between the end of exon 2 and the beginning of exon 4 and would result in the generation of a 341-bp fragment from RNA and a 590-bp fragment from genomic cDNA. PCR samples were run on an agarose gel containing 1 μg/ml ethidium bromide, and the gel was viewed under a long wave UV transilluminator. Northern Blotting—Total RNA of primary breast carcinoma tissue was generated using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions following mechanical disaggregation of samples using a dismembranator on dry ice. Northern blots were preformed as previously described (13Dalziel M. Whitehouse C. McFarlane I. Brockhausen I. Gschmeissner S. Schwientek T. Clausen H. Burchell J.M. Taylor-Papadimitriou J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11007-11015Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). ST6GalNAc-I mRNA was detected using a full-length probe, and ST6GalNAc-II mRNA was detected using a 1-kb HindIII-XbaI fragment. ST6GalNAc-I mRNA expression in normal human tissues was analyzed on a multiple tissue expression array (Clontech, Basingstoke, UK) containing normal human tissue poly(A)+ RNA, using the above full-length ST6GalNAc-I probe. Western Blotting—CHO MUC1 STn cell culture supernatants were collected for analysis of the secreted MUC1 protein. 20 μl of supernatant was separated on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and then blotted onto nitrocellulose membrane overnight. The blot was blocked overnight at 4 °C in phosphate-buffered saline, 0.2% Tween 20, 1% bovine serum albumin (PTB). For detection of the STn-carrying glycoprotein, the blot was incubated at room temperature for 1 h with biotinylated TKH2 (4 μg/ml) in PTB. Following three washes in PTB the blot was incubated at room temperature for 1 h with streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase (1/1500 dilution in PTB). For the detection of total MUC1-IgG in the supernatants, the blot was incubated directly with rabbit anti-mouse serum (1/1500 dilution in PTB). After three additional washes the bound antibody-streptavidin horseradish peroxidase complex was detected using enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) and light-sensitive film. Large Scale Production of MUC1-IgG-STn—CHO MUC1-ST6GalNAc-I cells were grown in suspension in the serum-free medium ProCHO4-CDM (BioWhittaker Europe). Continuous perfusion fermentations with cell retention by spin filtration were done in a standard stirred vessel bioreactor with a working volume of 1L (Applicon Biotek, Knuellwald, Germany) under controlled conditions as described elsewhere (37Link T. Backstrom M. Graham R. Essers R. Zorner K. Gatgens J. Burchell J. Taylor-Papadimitriou J. Hansson G.C. Noll T. J. Biotechnol. 2004; 110: 51-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Cells were removed from supernatant by filtration through a Sartobran 300 capsule with a 0.2-μm cut-off (Sartorius, Gottingen, Germany), and the cell-free supernatant was concentrated by ultrafiltration and rebuffered in 200 mm Tris/HCl buffer, pH 7.2, using an Ultrasette tangential flow device (Pall, Dreieich, Germany) with a 100-kDa cut-off. The whole downstream processing was done at a temperature of 0-4 °C. O-Glycan Structure and Site Occupancy Determination by Liquid Chromatography-Electrospray Ionization Mass Spectrometry—O-glycans from 20 μg of purified MUC1-IgG were released by reductive β-elimination and analyzed by LC-ESI MS (36Backstrom M. Link T. Olson F.J. Karlsson H. Graham R. Picco G. Burchell J. Taylor-Papadimitriou J. Noll T. Hansson G.C. Biochem. J. 2003; 376: 677-686Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The relative amounts of the different oligosaccharides were obtained from the integrated peak areas in the chromatogram corresponding to each of the molecular ions (Neu5Acα2-6)GalNAcol (m/z 513), Neu5Acα2-3Galβ1-3GalNAcol and Galβ1-3(Neu5Acα2-6)GalNAcol (m/z 675), and Neu5Acα2-3Galβ1-3(Neu5Acα2-6)GalNAcol (m/z 966 and 483). The occupancy of the O-glycosylation sites in MUC1 was determined as described previously (36Backstrom M. Link T. Olson F.J. Karlsson H. Graham R. Picco G. Burchell J. Taylor-Papadimitriou J. Noll T. Hansson G.C. Biochem. J. 2003; 376: 677-686Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), except that the treatment with Vibrio cholerae neuraminidase was performed at pH 4.5.-5.0 and the glycopeptides generated by Clostripain digestion were analyzed by nano-LC-ESI MS using a Finnegan LTQ mass spectrometer (Thermo Electron, Waltham, MA). Integration of peaks in mass chromatograms was performed using XCalibur software. Expression of the STn O-Glycan Correlates with Expression of hST6GalNAc-I but Not with hST6GalNAc-II in Primary Breast Cancer—Unlike the situation with cells of the normal gastrointestinal tract, mRNA coding for the hST6GalNAc-I enzyme is not expressed in the normal human mammary gland (Fig. 2, G9). To examine the correlation between STn expression and the expression of hST6GalNAc-I, we analyzed a series of 29 primary breast cancers for expression of hST6GalNAc-I mRNA and of STn. Immunohistochemical analysis of the breast cancers was previously performed using the monoclonal antibody TKH2, which recognizes single as well as clustered STn O-glycans (38Ogata S. Koganty R. Reddish M. Longenecker B.M. Chen A. Perez C. Itzkowitz S.H. Glycoconj. J. 1998; 15: 29-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Of the 29 breast carcinomas analyzed, 10 were found to express STn (Table 1). Six were highly positive while four cases showed weaker staining. Using Northern blot analysis and a full-length probe (Fig. 3a), it appeared that some of the tumors expressing STn did not express detectable hST6GalNAc-I message. These were tumors showing a weaker expression of STn (see Table 1), but by using RT-PCR, expression of the hST6GalNAc-I mRNA was detected (Fig. 3b, upper panel).TABLE 1Correlation between expression of STn and ST6GalNAc-I in primary breast cancersCase numberSTn statusST6GalNAc-I Northern analysisST6GalNAc-I RT-PCR analysis26+−+23+−+27+−+4+−+1++−+28++++NAaNA, tissue not available.29++++NA22+++++10+++++24+++++13, 3, 20, 2, 12, 14−−−21, 18, 7, 5, 19, 9, 8−−−15, 16, 6, 11, 17, 25−−−a NA, tissue not available.

https://openalex.org/W2136584723,"Sphingosine kinase 1 (SK1) phosphorylates sphingosine to form sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P), which has the ability to promote cell proliferation and survival and stimulate angiogenesis. The SK1/S1P pathway also plays a critical role in regulation of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), a well-established pathogenic factor in colon carcinogenesis. Therefore, we examined the expression of SK1 and COX-2 in rat colon tumors induced by azoxymethane (AOM) and the relationship of these two proteins in normal and malignant intestinal epithelial cells. Strongly positive SK1 staining was found in 21/28 (75%) of rat colon adenocarcinomas induced by AOM, whereas no positive SK1 staining was observed in normal mucosa. The increase in SK1 and COX-2 expression in AOM-induced rat colon adenocarcinoma was confirmed at the level of mRNA by real-time RT-PCR. In addition, it was found that 1) down-regulation of SK1 in HT-29 human colon cancer cells by small interfering RNA (siRNA) decreases COX-2 expression and PGE2 production; 2) overexpression of SK1 in RIE-1 rat intestinal epithelial cells induces COX-2 expression; and 3) S1P stimulates COX-2 expression and PGE2 production in HT-29 cells. These results suggest that the SK1/S1P pathway may play an important role in colon carcinogenesis, in part, by regulating COX-2 expression and PGE2 production."

A physiological role for Sep15 and SelM as thiol-disulfide oxidoreductases and their contribution to the quality control pathways of the endoplasmic reticulum are discussed. The formation of disulfide bonds is an essential step in the structural maturation of secretory and membrane proteins. All living organisms have evolved mechanistically related pathways to catalyze the formation of disulfide bonds (1Sevier C.S. Kaiser C.A. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 3: 836-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (567) Google Scholar). In eukaryotes, disulfide bonds are formed primarily within the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum. An intricate series of protein folding and quality control mechanisms localized to this organelle regulate the formation of disulfide bonds through thiol-disulfide exchange (2Ellgaard L. Helenius A. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 4: 181-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (1656) Google Scholar).Thiol-disulfide oxidoreductases catalyze thiol-disulfide exchange between proteins with free thiols and thiol-containing small molecules or proteins with disulfide bonds. The activities of these enzymes are dependent upon active-site cysteine residues that are arranged in a CXXC motif or CXXC-derived motifs, in which one of these cysteines may be replaced by selenocysteine, serine, or threonine (3Fomenko D.E. Gladyshev V.N. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 11214-11225Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Enzymatic activity and the direction of exchange (oxidation or reduction) depend upon redox potential, interactions with other redox proteins, and the availability of terminal electron donors and acceptors (4Ellgaard L. Ruddock L.W. EMBO Rep. 2005; 6: 28-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (620) Google Scholar).Selenium is an essential trace element that is incorporated into proteins as the 21st natural amino acid in the genetic code, selenocysteine. Selenoproteins are found throughout prokaryotic (5Kryukov G.V. Gladyshev V.N. EMBO Rep. 2004; 5: 538-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar) and eukaryotic proteomes (6Kryukov G.V.

Science. 2003; 300: 1439-1443Crossref PubMed Scopus (1809) Google Scholar), and most have orthologs in which selenocysteine is replaced with cysteine. The identity of the active-site redox motif residues (selenocysteine or cysteine) regulates the redox potential and catalytic efficiency of these enzymes (7Stadtman T.C. Annu. Rev.

Although selenoproteins appear to mediate these effects, physiological roles for most of these proteins are unknown. Two recently identified eukaryotic selenoproteins, Sep15 (15Gladyshev V.N.

Gladyshev V.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 1402-1411Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar), have selenocysteine-containing CXXC-like motifs, suggesting that they might function as redox proteins within the endoplasmic reticulum. Irrespective of this motif, these selenoproteins share no sequence similarities with known redox proteins. In an attempt to understand the physiological roles of these proteins, the solution NMR structures of fruit fly Sep15 and mouse SelM were determined. These structures identify a thioredoxin-like domain and the location of the active-site redox motif. Additional data demonstrate that these proteins undergo localized conformational changes centered on the active-site redox motif after thiol-disulfide exchange and suggest that they function as thiol-disulfide oxidoreductases that participate in the formation of disulfide bonds.MATERIALS AND METHODSProtein Expression and Purification—Because recombinant selenoproteins are difficult to prepare in heterologous expression systems, the single selenocysteine residue (U48) in SelM from Mus musculus was mutated to cysteine (48U→C) to facilitate these structural studies. In contrast, Sep15 from D. melanogaster does not contain a selenocysteine residue and, accordingly, is a natural cysteine-containing ortholog of Sep15. The coding regions of the mouse SelM gene and the fruit fly Sep15 gene were PCR-amplified from a cDNA clone and a cDNA library (Novagen) with the following primers: 5′-TCCAGCCACCCATATGACCAACTACCGACCGGATTGGAACC-3′ and 5′-GGTGGTGGTGCTCGAGGTCGTCGTGTTCTGAAGCTTCCTC-3′ (residues 25-145 of SelM-48U→C including an uncleaved C-terminal hexahistidine tag (designated as SelM)) (16Korotkov K.V. Novoselov S.V. Hatfield D.L. Gladyshev V.N. Mol. Cell.

PCR products were digested with NdeI/XhoI (SelM) or NheI/XhoI (Sep15), ligated into pET21a (SelM) or pET19b (Sep15), and verified by DNA sequencing.SelM and Sep15 were expressed in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) cells. Cell cultures were grown at 37 °C until the A600 reached 0.6. Protein expression was induced by adding 0.4 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalacto-side, and the cells were grown for 16 h at 30 °C. After induction, bacterial cells were harvested by centrifugation at 4700 × g for 15 min at 4 °C, and cell pellets were re-suspended in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100, 10 mg/liter lysozyme, 5 mg/liter DNase I, and EDTA-free Complete Protease Inhibitor Tablets (Roche Applied Science)) and lysed by sonication. Cell lysates were centrifuged at 40,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. Both proteins were purified by immobilized metal-chelate affinity, ion exchange, and gel filtration chromatography.NMR Spectroscopy—Proteins uniformly labeled with 15N or 13C,15N were produced by supplementing M9 media with 1 g/liter [15N]ammonium chloride, 3 g/liter d-[13C]glucose, 0.5 ml/liter 0.5% thiamine, 2 mm MgSO4, 0.1 mm CaCl2, 0.5 ml/liter 10 mg/ml biotin, and 100 μg/ml carbenicillin. All NMR experiments were acquired at 25 °C with Varian INOVA spectrometers operating at proton frequencies of 500 and 600 MHz using 1 mm protein samples dissolved in 50 mm sodium phosphate (pH 6.0) and 50 mm NaCl. NMR data were processed with NMRPipe (17Delaglio F. Grzesiek S. Vuister G.W. Zhu G. Pfeifer J. Bax A. J. Biomol.

Backbone and aliphatic side chain chemical shift assignments were obtained from standard triple resonance experiments: HNCO, HNCACB, CBCA(CO)NH, HNHA, C(CO)NH-two-dimensional total correlation spectroscopy (TOCSY), H(CCO)NH-TOCSY, and HCCH-TOCSY. Aromatic side chain chemical shifts were assigned with two-dimensional double quantum filtered correlation spectroscopy and NOESY 3The abbreviations used are: NOESY two-dimensional nuclear Overhauser (NOE) effect spectroscopy; HSQC, heteronuclear single quantum correlation; Bis-Tris, 2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]-2-(hydroxymethyl)propane-1,3-diol; siRNA, small interfering RNA; UGGT, UDP-glucose:glycoprotein glucosyltransferase. (τm = 100 ms) experiments using 15N-labeled protein samples in 99.9% D2O. Stereospecific chemical shift assignments for valine and leucine methyl groups were obtained with two constant time 1H, 13C HSQC experiments (28- and 43-ms delay) using 10% 13C uniformly labeled samples (19Neri D. Szyperski T. Otting G. Senn H. Wuthrich K. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 7510-7516Crossref PubMed Scopus (563) Google Scholar). Residual dipolar couplings were extracted from in-phase anti-phase experiments using 15N-labeled samples aligned in 5% polyacrylamide stretched gels (20Chou J.J. Gaemers S. Howder B. Louis J.M. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 2001; 21: 377-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar).Distance restraints were obtained from three-dimensional 15N-edited NOESY (τm = 100 ms) and 13C-edited NOESY (τm = 100 ms) spectra recorded from 15N- and 13C,15N-labeled proteins. Restraints for the dihedral backbone angles (ϕ,ψ) were derived from an analysis of 13Cα, 13Cβ, 13CO, and 15N chemical shifts using TALOS (21Cornilescu G. Delaglio F. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1999; 13: 289-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (2729) Google Scholar). Error bounds for these restraints were set to twice the S.D. of the predictions with a minimum bound of ±30°. Hydrogen bond restraints were established for those amide protons protected from D2O exchange in 1H,15N HSQC experiments.Structure calculations were performed with ARIA (22Habeck M. Rieping W. Linge J.P. Nilges M. Methods Mol. Biol. 2004; 278: 379-402PubMed Google Scholar). ARIA runs were initiated using a set of NOEs manually assigned from 15N-edited NOESY spectra. NOEs from 13C-edited NOESY spectra were introduced into the calculation once an initial ensemble of low energy structures was obtained. MOLMOL (23Koradi R. Billeter M. Wuthrich K. J. Mol. Graph. 1996; 14: 51-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (6469) Google Scholar) was used to assign carbonyl partners for amide protons that were protected from D2O exchange. Hydrogen bond restraints were set to 1.3 Å < dNH-O < 2.5 Å and 2.3 Å < dN-O < 3.5 Å, respectively. Protein alignment tensors calculated with PALES (24Zweckstetter M. Bax A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2000; 122: 3791-3792Crossref Scopus (592) Google Scholar) were used for structural refinement against residual dipolar coupling data. Structural coordinates have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank and have been assigned the accession codes 2A2P (SelM) and 2A4H (Sep15).Redox Potential—Analysis of the equilibrium redox potential of fruit fly Sep15 (residues 62-178) was performed as previously described (25Su D. Gladyshev V.N. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 12177-12188Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Sep15, contained in 100 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.0), 1 mm EDTA, and various concentrations of reduced and oxidized glutathione, was incubated at room temperature for 12 h. Protein samples were precipitated with cold 15% trichloroacetic acid for 15 min, centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 10 min, washed with cold acetone, and dried. Samples were re-suspended in buffer (100 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.0), 1 mm EDTA and 1% SDS) and alkylated with 15 mm 4-acetamido-4′-maleimidylstilbene-2,2′-disulfonic acid (Molecular Probes) for 2 h at 37°C. Alkylated samples were resolved by SDS-PAGE using NuPAGE Bis-Tris gels under reducing conditions followed by Western blotting using Sep15-specific antibodies. The redox potential was calculated using the Nernst equation as previously described (26Aslund F. Berndt K.D. Holmgren A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30780-30786Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar).RNA Interference, Overexpression, and Oxidative Stress—Four siRNA expression cassettes (designated S1-S4) targeted against different regions of mouse Sep15 mRNA were generated using the Silencer Express Kit (Ambion) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The following primers were used: S1, 5′-TGCCTACACAAAGCAAGAGCTGCAGAGCAAGCGGTGTTTCGTCCTTTCCACAAG-3′ and 5′-CGGCGAAGCTTTTTCCAAAAAACTTGCTCTGCAGCTCTTGCCTACACAAAGCAA-3′; S2, 5′-ATCCTACACAAAGATGGCTCCTGCATACAGCCGGTGTTTCGTCCTTTCCACAAG-3′ and 5′-CGGCGAAGCTTTTTCCAAAAAAGCTGTATGCAGGAGCCATCCTACACAAAGATG-3′; S3, 5′-GACCTACACAAAGTCTGAGCCTCGAACATACCGGTGTTTCGTCCTTTCCACAAG-3′ and 5′-CGGCGAAGCTTTTTCCAAAAAAGTATGTTCGAGGCTCAGACCTACACAAAGTCT-3′; S4, 5′-AGTCTACACAAAACTTCTCGCTCAGGAACTCCGGTGTTTCGTCCTTTCCACAAG-3′ and 5′-CGGCGAAGCTTTTTCCAAAAAAGAGTTCCTGAGCGAGAAGTCTACACAAAACTT-3′. PCR products were digested with EcoRI/HindIII, ligated into the pSEC-hygro vector, and verified by DNA sequencing.Mouse fibroblast NIH-3T3 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum to ∼80% confluence. Transfections were performed using Lipofectamine and PLUS reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. For each 60-mm plate, 2 μg of DNA, 8 μl of PLUS reagent, and 12 μl of Lipofectamine were used. Twenty-four hours after transfection cells stably expressing Sep15-specific siRNA were isolated by resistance to hygromycin B. Down-regulation of Sep15 mRNA expression was confirmed by Northern blotting using a Sep15-specific probe. To ensure equal loading of RNA, Northern blots were stripped and re-probed using a glycelaldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase-specific probe. Protein expression was assayed by Western blotting using Sep15-specific antibodies. Cells stably transfected with S4-siRNA were used to assess the sensitivity to oxidative stress.The coding region of the mouse Sep15 gene was PCR-amplified from a cDNA clone with the following primers: 5′-CATTAGTATCTAATCTCGAGGGCAGACCGCAGGGAT-3′ and 5′-CTCGAGGGATACTCTAGAGCG-3′. The PCR product was digested with XhoI/NotI and ligated into the pCI-neo vector (designated Sep15/pCI-neo). Mutagenesis of the mouse Sep15 gene was carried out using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). The following mutagenic primers were used to replace the selenocysteine residue: 5′-CTTGAAGTCTGCGGATGTAAATTGGGGAGGTTCC-3′ and 5′-GGAACCTCCCCAATTTACATCCGCAGACTTCAAG-3′. Expected sequence changes were verified by DNA sequencing (designated Sep15-U93C/pCI-neo). NIH-3T3 cells were transfected with these plasmids as described above. Stable transfectants were isolated by resistance to G418.The sensitivity of NIH-3T3 cells to oxidative stress was analyzed with the CellTiter 96 AQueous One Solution Cell Proliferation Assay (Promega). 5 × 103 of cells were seeded into each well of 96-well plates and grown overnight in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. Cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and incubated in serum/phenol red-free medium containing tert-butyl hydroperoxide and cumyl hydroperoxide for 1 h at 37 °C in a humidified 5% CO2 incubator. 20 μl of CellTiter 96 AQueous One Solution reagent was added to each well and incubated for an additional four hours. The A490 was recorded using an ELx808 Ultra microplate reader (Bio-Tek Instruments). Cell viability is expressed as the percentage of untreated controls.Expression Pattern Analysis—Four-month-old male BALB/c mice were maintained on a Torula yeast diet (Harland Teklad) supplemented with 0, 0.1, or 0.4 ppm selenium in the form of Na2SeO3 for 1 month. Tissues were homogenized in CelLytic-M lysis buffer (Sigma) containing EDTA-free Complete Protease Inhibitor Tablets by sonication and centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 20 min. The expression patterns of Sep15, glutathione peroxidase 1, and thioredoxin reductase 3 were analyzed by Western blotting using antibodies against these proteins.RESULTSStructure Determination—Although SelM and Sep15 are distant sequence homologs, they do share regions of significant sequence identity. Multiple sequence alignments were used to define the boundaries of a putative homologous domain that is shared between these proteins. Residues 1-23 of mouse SelM and residues 1-16 of fruit fly Sep15 form signal sequences that are cleaved during protein maturation. The chemical shift dispersion of the 1H,15N HSQC spectra of full-length SelM (residues 24-145) and full-length Sep15 (residues 17-178) revealed the presence of poorly ordered regions in Sep15. By comparing the 1H,15N HSQC spectra of Sep15 with different construct boundaries, we determined that the N terminus of Sep15 (residues 17-61) was disordered. The high resolution solution NMR structures of mouse SelM-48U→C (residues 25-145) and the homologous region of fruit fly Sep15 (residues 62-178) were determined under oxidizing conditions by standard double and triple resonance experiments using protein samples uniformly labeled with 15N or 13C,15N (Table 1). A combination of proton-proton distances, dihedral angles, hydrogen bonds, and residual dipolar couplings were used in the structural calculations (Fig. 1A).TABLE 1Structural statistics for the twenty lowest energy SelM and Sep 15 structuresList of restraintsSelMSep15NOE distance restraints27611904Unambiguous26651879Ambiguous9625Hydrogen bond restraints4736Dihedral angle (Φ Ψ) restraints from TALOS72511H, 15N residual dipolar couplings4019Structural analysisAverage number of NOE violations >0.5 Å0.35 ± 0.570.15 ± 0.36Average number of dihedral violations >5°2.9 ± 1.100.24 ± 0.43Ramachandran plotaCalculated with PROCHECK-NMR (55) using residues 36-44, 54-73, 80-85, 89-97, and 100-116 (SelM) and 71-80, 89-95, 98-119, 127-132, and 139-149 (Sep15).Most favored80.4%80.8%Additionally allowed19.6%19.2%Generously allowed0%0%Disallowed0%0%Deviations from idealized geometrybCalculated with ARIA.Bond, Å0.003 ± 0.00020.003 ± 0.0001Angels, °0.488 ± 0.0100.414 ± 0.013Impropers, °0.442 ± 0.0490.384 ± 0.024Deviations from experimental restraintsbCalculated with ARIA.Dihedral angles, °1.852 ± 0.1190.722 ± 0.136Residual dipolar couplings, Hz0.330 ± 0.0480.363 ± 0.201Deviations from average structureaCalculated with PROCHECK-NMR (55) using residues 36-44, 54-73, 80-85, 89-97, and 100-116 (SelM) and 71-80, 89-95, 98-119, 127-132, and 139-149 (Sep15).Backbone, Å0.28 ± 0.080.45 ± 0.11Heavy atoms, Å0.80 ± 0.200.83 ± 0.20a Calculated with PROCHECK-NMR (55Laskowski R.A.

Open table in a new tab Overall Description of the Structure—SelM and Sep15 contain a central α/β domain (22% sequence identity) that is composed of three α-helices (α1-α3) and a mixed parallel/anti-parallel four-stranded β-sheet (β1-β4) (Fig. 1, A and B). Conserved residues primarily form the internal core of this domain and delineate each of the secondary structural elements (Fig. 2). Structure-based multiple sequence alignments illustrate that SelM has a short N-terminal extension that precedes strand β1 and a flexible C-terminal extension after helix α3. In contrast, Sep15 has an elongated cysteine-rich N-terminal extension before strand β1 and a shorter C-terminal extension after helix α3 that does not adopt a regular secondary structure. The sequence of the N-terminal extension of Sep15 is highly conserved among Sep15 homologs and is conversely absent in sequence homologs of SelM (Fig. 2).FIGURE 2Structure-based multiple sequence alignment of SelM and Sep15 homologs. Assigned secondary structure elements for SelM and Sep15 are indicated above each sequence with α-helices colored blue and β-strands colored orange. Strictly conserved residues are shown in blue, and moderately conserved residues are shown in red. The active-site redox motif, including the selenocysteine residue (U), is colored green and is located between the C terminus of strand β1 and the N terminus of helix α1. The following accession numbers were used to generate this alignment: human SelM (27805722); mouse SelM (23956246); zebrafish SelM (29648551); human Sep15 (6094261); mouse Sep15 (20140242); zebrafish Sep15 (68053306); rat Sep15 (20139870); mosquito (18389881); fruit fly Sep15 (24666045).

A search of the DALI data base of protein structures (28Holm L. Sander C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 316-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (595) Google Scholar) identified members of the thioredoxin superfamily as the closest structural relatives for these proteins. The highest similarities were obtained for subunit B8 from human NADH ubiquinone oxidoreductase complex I (29Brockmann C. Diehl A. Rehbein K. Strauss H. Schmieder P. Korn B. Kuhne R. Oschkinat H.

Structure. 1996; 4: 735-751Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar) (Supplemental Tables 1 and 2).Proteins involved in the regulation of intracellular redox homeostasis and redox-sensitive protein folding pathways often contain thioredoxin-like domains. The classical thioredoxin fold is described as a three-layer α/β/α sandwich composed of a mixed five-stranded β-sheet and two pairs of α-helices that are found on either side of the β-sheet (32Martin J.L. Structure. 1995; 3: 245-250Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (685) Google Scholar) (Supplemental Fig. 1B). A recent comprehensive structural classification of the thioredoxin-like fold (33Qi Y. Grishin N.V. Proteins. 2005; 58: 376-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) describes it as a two-layer α/β sandwich composed of a mixed four-stranded β-sheet and a pair of α-helices that are packed against one side of the β-sheet. Although SelM and Sep15 share structural similarities with other proteins containing thioredoxin-like domains, these NMR structures represent the most basic thioredoxin-like fold, containing only the core secondary structure elements as defined by Qi and Grishin (33Qi Y. Grishin N.V. Proteins. 2005; 58: 376-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar).Sequence and structural motifs can be used to assign which family within the thioredoxin superfamily putative thiol-disulfide oxidoreductases may belong (33Qi Y. Grishin N.V. Proteins. 2005; 58: 376-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar); however, such comparisons do not provide direct evidence of biological function. Using the structural consensus of thioredoxin homologs and circular permutations of this fold (33Qi Y. Grishin N.V. Proteins. 2005; 58: 376-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), all structurally defined proteins containing thioredoxin-like domains have been grouped into eleven evolutionary families based on sequence, structural, and functional evidence. A manual structure-based alignment of SelM and Sep15 demonstrates that they are clearly members of the thioredoxin family; however, they do form a distinct subfamily within that family. As observed with other proteins with thioredoxin-like domains, the unusual active-site redox motifs of SelM (CGGU) and Sep15 (CGU) are located between the C terminus of strand β1 and the N terminus of helix α1 (Fig. 1B). The fold and location of these redox motifs suggest redox activity for Sep15 and SelM. However, the consensus sequences of the active-site motifs of thioredoxins (CGPC), protein disulfide isomerases (CGHC) and disulfide oxidases (CPHC) are different from those of SelM (CGGC) and Sep15 (CG/TC) (4Ellgaard L. Ruddock L.W. EMBO Rep. 2005; 6: 28-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (620) Google Scholar, 33Qi Y. Grishin N.V. Proteins. 2005; 58: 376-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Many structurally defined members of the thioredoxin superfamily have a conserved cis-proline residue placed near the N terminus of strand β3 (33Qi Y. Grishin N.V. Proteins. 2005; 58: 376-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Although SelM and Sep15 do indeed have prolines located at these positions, they are in the trans-conformation. However, a charge pair that is involved in the proton transfer reaction in thioredoxin (4Ellgaard L. Ruddock L.W. EMBO Rep. 2005; 6: 28-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (620) Google Scholar, 34Dyson H.J.

Biol. 2004; 335: 283-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) is not found in SelM and Sep15. Nevertheless, given the similarities to other characterized thiol-disulfide oxidoreductases (32Martin J.L. Structure. 1995; 3: 245-250Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (685) Google Scholar, 33Qi Y. Grishin N.V. Proteins. 2005; 58: 376-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), the surface accessibility and unusual composition of the active-site redox motif, the presence of residues known to influence the activity of other redox proteins suggests that SelM and Sep15 are thiol-disulfide oxidoreductases that are capable of forming reversible mixed selenenylsulfide bonds during the catalytic cycle of oxidation and reduction.Structural Effect of Active-site Disulfide Bond Reduction—The chemical shift dispersion of the 1H,15N HSQC spectra for the oxidized and reduced forms of SelM (Fig. 3A) and Sep15 (Fig. 3B) indicates that they remain folded in both oxidation states. Comparing the oxidized and reduced 1H, 15N HSQC spectra demonstrates that most of the backbone amide resonances are unchanged by the reduction of the active-site disulfide bond and that thiol-disulfide exchange is not accompanied by a large conformational change. However, significant changes in backbone amide resonances were observed for some residues. These differences are consistent with a localized structural rearrangement centered on the active-site redox motifs of SelM (Fig. 3A) and Sep15 (Fig. 3B). Comparison of the oxidized and reduced forms of thioredoxin also shows similar changes surrounding the active-site redox m"

By quantifying metabolic fluxes and global mRNA abundance, we investigated the genetic and metabolic mechanisms that underlie adaptive evolution of four metabolic gene deletion mutants of Escherichia coli (Δpgi, Δppc, Δpta, and Δtpi) in parallel evolution experiments of each mutant. The initial response to the gene deletions was flux rerouting through local bypass reactions or normally latent pathways. The principal effect of evolution was improved capacity of already active pathways, whereas new flux distributions were not observed. Combinatorial changes in capacity and pathway activation, however, led to different intracellular flux states that enabled evolution in three of the four parallel cases tested. The molecular bases of the evolved phenotypes were then elucidated by global mRNA transcript analyses. Activation of latent pathways and flux changes in the tricarboxylic acid cycle were found to correlate well with molecular changes at the transcriptional level. Flux alterations in other central metabolic pathways, in contrast, were apparently not connected to changes in the transcriptional network. These results give new insight into the dynamics of the evolutionary process by demonstrating the flexibility of the metabolic network of E. coli to compensate for genetic perturbations and the utility of combining multiple high throughput data sets to differentiate between causal and noncausal mechanistic changes.

All biological systems are capable of short term response to environmental changes and, on longer time scales, to evolutionary adaptation. Due to the high growth rates and large numbers of individuals, adaptive evolution of microbes under laboratory conditions rapidly leads to improved growth phenotypes. This principle is exploited for evolutionary engineering (1Sauer U. Adv. Biochem. Eng. Biotechnol. 2001; 73: 129-169PubMed Google Scholar, 2Zelder O. Hauer B. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 2000; 3: 248-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) and experimental testing of general evolutionary principles (3Fong S.S. Palsson B.O. Nat. Genet. 2004; 36: 1056-1058Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar, 4Cooper T.F. Rozen D.E. Lenski R.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Combining experimental evolution with targeted genetic perturbations then allows one to pose specific questions on robustness and adaptability of biological networks. In response to such externally introduced deletions, microorganisms can invoke a number of different strategies to adjust their functionality. For metabolic networks, these strategies can involve a local bypass of the deleted reaction, complete redirection of flux, reassignment of enzymes to catalyze the deleted reaction, activation of silent genes, or activation of otherwise down-regulated pathways. Whereas all of these mechanisms could potentially cope with genetic perturbations, the exact mechanisms utilized during evolution are poorly understood. Thus, a central question in adaptation and evolution is to determine whether evolving cells refine their existing pathway usage or whether they invoke major metabolic changes such as the activation of latent pathways. The molecular basis of such evolutionary processes is now experimentally traceable with the ability to rapidly improve microbial phenotypes using laboratory evolution (from weeks to a few months) (6Ibarra R.U. Edwards J.S. Palsson B.O. Nature. 2002; 420: 186-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (654) Google Scholar, 7Fong S.S. Marciniak J.Y. Palsson B.O. J.

Raghunathan A. Cantor C.R. Palsson B.O. van den Boom D. Genome Res. 2004; 14: 2495-2502Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). As a particularly popular tool, simultaneous transcript level monitoring of all genes within the genome by DNA microarray technology was used to identify altered gene expression in evolved Escherichia coli and Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains (4Cooper T.F. Rozen D.E. Lenski R.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 1072-1077Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar, 10Ferea T.L. Botstein D. Brown P.O. Rosenzweig R.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.

Microbiol. 2004; 70: 2307-2317Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Altered expression levels, however, do not distinguish between cause and effect and thus cannot directly reveal mechanistic links between altered expression and phenotype. In particular, when considering evolution of metabolic functions, more direct information on intracellular flux rerouting would be necessary to reveal the molecular mechanisms that cause a given improved phenotype. Such in vivo reaction rates are accessible through methods of 13C-based metabolic flux analysis (12Sauer U. Curr. Opin. Biotechnol. 2004; 15: 58-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar), which have been used successfully to identify functional flux states in various microbes (13Perrenoud A. Sauer U. J. Bacteriol. 2005; 187: 3171-3179Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar, 14Fischer E. Sauer U. Nat. Genet. 2005; 37: 636-640Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar, 15Blank L.M. Kuepfer L.

Mortensen U.H. Sosio M. Nielsen J. Mol. Microbiol. 2004; 52: 895-902Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Potentially, flux data can fill the gap between the intrinsically noisy and indirect transcriptome, proteome, or metabolome data and the actual phenotype (18Hellerstein M.K. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 2003; 23: 379-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 19Bailey J.E. Nat. Biotechnol. 1999; 17: 616-618Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Thus, the combination of transcript profiles and quantitative intracellular flux data can provide greater insight into biological processes at the molecular level by implicating gene expression changes to altered phenotypes through association with measured flux data. Beyond maximizing growth rates of wild-type strains on “exotic” substrates through adaptive evolution (6Ibarra R.U. Edwards J.S. Palsson B.O.

FEMS Yeast Res. 2005; 5: 925-934Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar), rapid recovery of high growth rates was demonstrated for metabolic gene deletion mutants of E. coli (3Fong S.S. Palsson B.O. Nat. Genet. 2004; 36: 1056-1058Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). Replicates of evolved mutants exhibited phenotypic characteristics that suggested the selection of different biochemical mechanisms during parallel evolution under identical conditions. The molecular bases, however, remained unknown because multiple flux scenarios could explain the improved growth phenotypes. Here we evolved four E. coli knock-out mutants affected in metabolic key branch points, phosphoglucose isomerase (pgi), phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase (ppc), phosphate transacetylase (pta), and triose-phosphate isomerase (tpi), for several hundred generations under exponential growth conditions on glucose. Since these lesions might be bypassed by at least two different routes, we used metabolic flux and global gene expression analysis to identify the metabolic mechanisms responsible for the improved phenotypes. Strain Construction—The ppc and tpi mutants of MG1655 were described previously (3Fong S.S. Palsson B.O. Nat. Genet. 2004; 36: 1056-1058Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar), and the pgi and pta mutants were constructed by in-frame gene deletions via homologous recombination facilitated by the λ red recombinase system (22Datsenko K.A. Wanner B.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 6640-6645Crossref PubMed Scopus (10838) Google Scholar) starting with the E. coli wild-type MG1655 (ATCC, Manassas, VA). The plasmids pKD46, pKD13, and pCP20 were used to introduce the recombinase gene, homologously recombine with the target gene, and remove antibiotic resistance markers, respectively. Each knock-out was confirmed by PCR with genomic DNA. Adaptive Evolution—Evolution of constructed deletion mutants of E. coli was conducted in 250 ml of M9 minimal medium supplemented with 2 g/liter of glucose in 500-ml Erlenmeyer flasks using magnetic stir bars for aeration at 37 °C. M9 medium contained (per liter of deionized water) 0.8 g of NH4Cl, 0.5 g of NaCl, 7.5 g of Na2HPO4·2H2O, and 3.0 g of KH2PO4. The following components were sterilized separately and then added (per liter final volume of medium): 2 ml of 1 m MgSO4, 1 ml of 0.1 m CaCl2, 0.3 ml of 1 mm filter-sterilized thiamine HCl, and 10 ml of a trace element solution containing (per liter) 1 g of FeCl3·6H2O, 0.18 g of ZnSO4·7H2O, 0.12 g of CuCl2·2H2O, 0.12 g of MnSO4·H2O, and 0.18 g of CoCl2·6H2O. At the start of evolution, initial precultures of each mutant were grown overnight in LB medium before being transferred to minimal medium for adaptive evolution. Duplicate evolution experiments were started from the same parental deletion mutant. In evolution cultures, cells were grown overnight and allowed to reach midexponential growth with an optical density at 600 nm (A600) below 0.5 before being diluted by passage into fresh medium. The dilution factor at each passage was adjusted daily to account for changes in growth rate. The optical density was typically at an A600 ≤ 2.4 × 10-6. This process of batch growth and serial passage was conducted for 30 days for the pta mutants (∼800 generations), 45 days for the ppc mutants (∼750 generations), and 50 days for the pgi (∼800 generations) and tpi (∼600 generations) mutants, where the ppc and tpi evolution experiments were reported previously (3Fong S.S. Palsson B.O. Nat. Genet. 2004; 36: 1056-1058Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). This process of evolution resulted in eight evolved mutants with end points designated as ptaE1, ptaE2, ppcE1, ppcE2, pgiE1, pgiE2, tpiE1, and tpiE2. The number of generations was estimated on a daily basis by calculating the starting optical density of each batch culture and determining how many doublings occurred during batch growth until being passed into fresh medium. Cultures were evolved until a stable growth rate was achieved for more than 5 days. This process of serial passage maintained a state of prolonged exponential growth so that no culture entered stationary phase. Duplicate cultures were evolved concurrently under identical conditions. 13C-Labeling Experiments—Frozen glycerol stock cultures were used to inoculate LB complex medium. After 8 h of incubation at 37 °C and constant shaking, LB precultures were used to inoculate M9 medium precultures that were grown overnight for inoculation of cultures for physiological or 13C-labeling experiments. Aerobic batch cultures containing 30 ml of M9 medium were inoculated (1:100–1:200) in 500-ml baffled shake flasks and incubated on a gyratory shaker at 250 rpm and 37 °C. For 13C-labeling experiments, glucose was added either entirely as the 1-13C-labeled isotope isomer (>99%; Euriso-top, GIF-sur-Yvette, France) or as a mixture of 20% (w/w) U-13C (>98%; Isotech, Miamisburg, OH) and 80% (w/w) natural glucose. Cell growth was monitored by following the A600. Glucose and acetate concentrations were determined enzymatically using commercial kits (Beckman-Coulter (Zurich, Switzerland) or Dispolab (Dielsdorf, Switzerland)). Other organic acids in culture supernatants were detected by high pressure liquid chromatography analysis (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) at a wavelength of 210 nm, using a Supelcogel C8 column (4.6 × 250 mm) at 30 °C and a mobile phase of 2% (v/v) sulfuric acid at a flow rate of 0.3 ml/min. The following physiological parameters were determined during the exponential growth phase as described previously (23Sauer U. Lasko D.R. Fiaux J. Hochuli M. Glaser R. Szyperski T. Wüthrich K. Bailey J.E. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 6679-6688Crossref PubMed Google Scholar): maximum growth rate, biomass yield on glucose, specific glucose consumption rate, and specific byproduct production rates, using a predetermined correlation factor of 0.44 g of cellular dry weight per liter and A600 unit. Metabolic Flux Ratio (METAFoR) 3The abbreviations used are: METAFoR, metabolic flux ratio; PEP, phosphoenolpyruvate; ED, Entner-Doudoroff; DHAP, dihydroxyacetone phosphate; MDV, mass distribution vector; EMP, Embden-Meyerhof-Parnas; PP, pentose phosphate. Analysis by Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry—Samples for gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis were prepared as described previously (24Fischer E. Sauer U. Eur. J. Biochem. 2003; 270: 880-891Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). Briefly, aliquots of 13C-labeled batch cultures were withdrawn during the midexponential growth phase (A600 = 0.8–1.2). Cell pellets were hydrolyzed in 6 m HCl at 105 °C for 24 h in sealed microtubes. The hydrolysates were dried under a stream of air at around 60 °C and then derivatized at 85 °C in 30 μl of dimethylformamide (Fluka, Buchs, Switzerland) and 30 μl of N-(tert-butyldimethylsilyl)-N-methyl-trifluoroacetamide with 1% (v/v) tert-butyldimethylchlorosilane (Fluka) for 60 min (25Fischer E. Zamboni N. Sauer U. Anal. Biochem. 2004; 325: 308-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). Derivatized amino acids were analyzed on a series 8000 GC, combined with an MD 800 mass spectrometer (Fisons Instruments, Beverly, MA). The gas chromatography-mass spectrometry-derived mass isotope distributions of proteinogenic amino acids were then corrected for naturally occurring isotopes (24Fischer E. Sauer U. Eur. J. Biochem. 2003; 270: 880-891Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). The corrected mass distributions were related to the in vivo metabolic activities with previously described algebraic equations and statistical data treatment, which quantified 12 largely independent ratios of fluxes through converging reactions and pathways to the synthesis of seven intracellular metabolites (24Fischer E. Sauer U. Eur. J. Biochem. 2003; 270: 880-891Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). In [1-13C]glucose experiments with tpi mutants, 13C label occurred in position 3 of pyruvate, but no position 3 13C label occurred in the upstream metabolites phosphoglycerate and phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP). The normal flux ratio definition of METAFoR analysis (24Fischer E. Sauer U. Eur. J. Biochem. 2003; 270: 880-891Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar) would relate this label to the Entner-Doudoroff (ED) pathway. This pathway, however, would introduce 13C label at the position 1 of pyruvate. The normally inactive methylglyoxal bypass, which channels dihydoxyacetone phosphate (DHAP) molecules to pyruvate, in contrast, would precisely introduce such 13C label at the position 3 of pyruvate (26Cooper R.A. Anderson A. FEBS Lett. 1970; 11: 273-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). To quantify the amount of pyruvate originating from DHAP through the methylglyoxal bypass (pyruvate through methylglyoxal bypass), we determined the mass isotopomer distribution vector (MDV) of glycerol, which is identical to the MDV of DHAP1–3 (1–3 indicates that carbon atoms 1–3 of DHAP are considered). The base fragment m0 = 377, which corresponds to a derivatized glycerol molecule (two tert-butyldimethylsilyl and one dimethylsilyl derivatization chain) was used. To assess the relative contribution of methylglyoxal bypass to pyruvate synthesis (f), the MDV of DHAP1–2, serine2–3, and pyruvate2–3 are used as follows. Pyruvate2-3=f·DHAP1-2+(1-f)·serine2-3(Eq. 1) The MDV of DHAP1–2 was not measured; however, the labeling enrichment for this fragment will be similar to the one of DHAP1–3, since position 1 of DHAP will be bearing the 13C-labeled atom. Hence, the MDV of DHAP1–2 can be calculated, and Equation 1 can be used to determine f. This approach neglects, however, the contribution of unlabeled two carbon molecules coming through the ED pathway. To take the ED pathway contribution into account, we applied an iterative process. The fraction of pyruvate molecules synthesized through the ED pathway was calculated from the previously determined methylglyoxylate flux ratio and the MDV of pyruvate1–3, DHAP1–3, serine1–3, and the MDV of a three-carbon unit with one labeled 13C atom as follows. Pyruvate1-3=f1·DHAP1-3+f2·MDV(C3-moleculewithone13Catom)+(1-f1-f2)·serine1-3(Eq. 2) where f1 represents the fraction of pyruvate molecules originating from DHAP, f2 represents one-half of the fraction derived through the ED pathway, and (1 - f1 - f2) represents the fraction derived through serine. Activity of the ED pathway introduces supplementary unlabeled pyruvate2–3 molecules. To account for these, the MDV of serine2–3 in Equation 1 was replaced by the MDV of a combination of unlabeled C2 molecules and serine2–3. The fraction of pyruvate2–3 molecules originating from DHAP1–2 was recalculated, and the whole process was repeated iteratively until stable values for both of the fractions of pyruvate2–3 molecules originating from DHAP1–2 and of pyruvate molecules derived through the ED pathway were obtained (around five iterations). The S.E. values for these two determined flux ratios were evaluated numerically. Indeed, since all individual components in the mass distribution vectors have an S.D. value (24Fischer E. Sauer U. Eur. J. Biochem. 2003; 270: 880-891Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar), normally distributed random values for these individual components were chosen using the MATLAB function normrnd (The Mathworks), with the constraint that the sum of the elements of a mass distribution is equal to 1. These new mass distribution vectors were used to determine the two ratios by repeating the process 1000 times in a MATLAB-based program. The mean values and the S.D. values for the two ratios were determined from these 1000 estimations. The mean values were within 1% of the calculated ratios, and the S.D. value was used as the error for the ratio. Moreover, in the absence of triose phosphate isomerase in the tpi mutants, the hypothesis used to calculate the flux ratios PEP through the pentose phosphate (PP) pathway and serine through Embden-Meyerhof-Parnas (EMP) pathway is not valid anymore. Therefore, a [1-13C]glucose experiment was used to determine the relative contribution of the EMP pathway to DHAP synthesis. In such a setup, all DHAP molecules derived through the EMP pathway contain a 13C atom at position 1, whereas the PP pathway will generate unlabeled DHAP molecules. Therefore, the relative contribution of the EMP pathway to DHAP can be determined as follows. DHAP1-3=f·(MDVofC3with one13C)+(1-f)·(MDV of labeledC3)(Eq. 3) where f represents the contribution of the EMP pathway to DHAP synthesis, and (1 - f) is the contribution of the oxidative branch of the PP pathway to DHAP synthesis. The error on this ratio was determined using error propagation (24Fischer E. Sauer U. Eur. J. Biochem. 2003; 270: 880-891Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). 13C-Constrained Net Flux Analysis—Intracellular net fluxes were estimated with a stoichiometric model that contained all major pathways of central carbon metabolism (25Fischer E. Zamboni N. Sauer U. Anal. Biochem. 2004; 325: 308-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). For the tpi mutants, the previously described stoichiometric model was augmented with the methylglyoxal bypass based on the METAFoR results. The network considered was similar to the one depicted in Fig. 1. For all mutant analyses, the deleted reactions were kept in the network to obtain independent evidence for their in vivo absence (or evidence for the takeover by another gene). Only for the ppc mutants was the reaction from 2-oxoglutarate to fumarate removed from the network, since METAFoR analysis demonstrated a complete absence of cyclic tricarboxylic acid cycle operation (see Supplemental Table 1). The reaction matrix consisted, for the different strains, of 25–29 unknown fluxes and 21–24 metabolite balances (including the three experimentally determined rates of glucose uptake, acetate, and biomass production). To solve this underdetermined system of equations with 4–5 degrees of freedom, the following seven calculated flux ratios were used as additional constraints, as was described previously (25Fischer E. Zamboni N. Sauer U. Anal. Biochem. 2004; 325: 308-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar): serine derived through the EMP pathway, pyruvate derived through the ED pathway, oxaloacetate originating from PEP, PEP originating from oxaloacetate, pyruvate originating from malate (upper and lower boundaries), and PEP derived through the PP pathway (upper boundary). The first four ratios were used as equality constraints, whereas the others were used only as boundary constraints. When active, based on the METAFoR data, the glyoxylate shunt was also considered in the network, and the ratio oxaloacetate originating from glyoxylate was implemented as an upper bound. 4A. Perrenoud, A. Schicker, and U. Sauer, submitted for publication. The ratios DHAP derived through the EMP pathway and pyruvate through the methylglyoxal bypass were used as equality constraints for the tpi mutants, using the following equations: the fraction of pyruvate derived through the methylglyoxal bypass. a=VDHAP→PYRVDHAP→PYR+VPEP→PYR+VMAL→PYR+V6PG→PYR(Eq. 4) and the fraction of DHAP derived through the EMP pathway. b=VF6P→GAP-DHAP-VP5P+E4P→F6P+GAP-VS7P+GAP→E4P+F6PVF6P→GAP+DHAP(Eq. 5) Fluxes into biomass were calculated from the known metabolite requirements for macromolecular compounds (28Neidhardt F.C. Ingraham J.L. Schaechter M. Physiology of the Bacterial Cell. Sinauer Associates, Inc., Sunderland, MA1990: 133-173Google Scholar) and the growth rate-dependent RNA and protein content (29Emmerling M. Dauner M. Ponti A. Fiaux J. Hochuli M. Szyperski T. Wüthrich K. Bailey J.E. Sauer U. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 152-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). The sum of the weighed square residuals of the constraints from both metabolite balances and flux ratios was minimized using the MATLAB function fmincon. The residuals were weighed by dividing through the experimental error (25Fischer E. Zamboni N. Sauer U. Anal. Biochem. 2004; 325: 308-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). The computation was repeated at least five times with randomly chosen initial flux distributions to ensure identification of the global minimum, and the system always converged to the same solution. An extended version of the software FiatFlux was used to calculate all metabolic flux ratios and net fluxes (30Zamboni N. Fischer E. Sauer U. BMC Bioinformatics. 2005; 6: 209Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). mRNA Transcriptional Profiling—Affymetrix (Santa Clara, CA) E. coli antisense genome arrays were used for all transcriptional analyses. Each experimental condition was tested in triplicate using independent cultures and processed following the manufacturer's recommended protocols. Six replicates of the wild-type strain grown on glucose were used for the reference point. Briefly, cultures were grown to midexponential growth phase (A600 ≈ 0.5). 3 ml of culture was added to 6 ml of RNAprotect (Qiagen, Valencia, CA), and RNA was isolated using RNeasy kits (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) following the manufacturer's instructions. Total RNA yields were measured using a spectrophotometer (A260), and quality was checked by visualization on agarose gels and by measuring the sample A260/A280 ratio. cDNA synthesis, fragmentation, and terminal labeling were conducted as recommended by Affymetrix. Raw .CEL files were analyzed using robust multiarray average (31Irizarry R.A. Hobbs B. Collin F. Beazer-Barclay Y.D. Antonellis K.J. Scherf U. Speed T.P. Biostatistics. 2003; 4: 249-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (8307) Google Scholar) for normalization and calculation of probe intensities. Expression values were then assessed for statistically significant differential expression using t tests. After conducting pairwise t test comparisons between evolved mutants and wild type, those genes meeting a 5% false discovery rate-adjusted p value cut-off were chosen as having statistically significant changes in gene expression. This resulted in selection of subsets of differentially expressed genes for each tested evolution mutant. These subsets of differentially expressed genes were then organized into known regulon structures (32Keseler I.M. Collado-Vides J. Gama-Castro S. Ingraham J. Paley S. Paulsen I.T. Peralta-Gil M. Karp P.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 2005; 33: D334-D337Crossref PubMed Scopus (558) Google Scholar) for further analysis. The probability (p value) of the observed regulon enrichment of differentially expressed genes was calculated using the hypergeometric distribution (33Cora D. Di Cunto F. Provero P. Silengo L. Caselle M. BMC Bioinformatics. 2004; 5: 57Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), p=1-∑i=0y-1ryN-rn-yNn(Eq. 6) where N (equal to 4345) represents the total number of E. coli genes listed on the Affymetrix GeneChip, r is the total number of genes that are a part of the regulon, n is the number of differentially expressed genes, and y is the number of genes that are differentially expressed and a member of the regulon. In Vitro Enzyme Activity—Crude cell extracts for in vitro enzyme assays were prepared from pellets of 45-ml culture aliquots. Pellets were resuspended in 4 ml of 0.9% (w/v) NaCl and 10 mm MgSO4, passed three times through a French pressure cell (1.2 × 108 pascals), and centrifuged at 11,000 × g. In vitro activity of the methylglyoxal bypass was determined by enzyme assays for methylglyoxal reductase and two coupled enzyme assays for methylglyoxal synthase-methylgloxal reductase and methylglyoxal synthase-glyoxalase. For methylglyoxal reductase, the assay of Saikusa et al. (34Saikusa T. Rhee H. Watanabe K. Murata K. Kimura A. Agric. Biol. Chem. 1987; 51: 1893-1899Google Scholar) was adapted: 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.125 mm NADPH, 10 mm methylglyoxal, and 100 μl of crude cell extract per ml of assay. The assay for methylglyoxal synthase-methylglyoxal reductase was similar to the previous one, with the sole difference being the use of 0.75 mm DHAP instead of methylglyoxal. For methylglyoxal synthase-glyoxalase, the assay of Hoper and Cooper (35Hopper D.J. Cooper R.A. Biochem. J. 1972; 128: 321-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) was adapted: 40 mm imidazole (pH 7.0), 1.65 mm glutathione (pH 7.0), 0.75 mm DHAP, and 100 μl of crude cell extract per ml of assay. For all three assays, the reaction was initiated by the addition of either methylglyoxal or DHAP and consumption of NADPH (at 340 nm), and formation of S-lactoylglutathione (240 nm) was detected in the two first and second assays, respectively. The extinction coefficients for NADPH and S-lactoylglutathione were 6.2 and 3.4 mm-1 cm-1, respectively. The protein content in crude cell extracts was determined with the biuret reaction. Physiological Characterization of Evolved Knock-out Mutants—To identify the metabolic routes chosen by adaptive evolution to cope with a gene knock-out, we selected four gene knock-outs that severely affect the flux distribution at key branch points of glucose catabolism: pgi, ppc, pta"
https://openalex.org/W2098744732,"Heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) is the rate limiting enzyme of heme catabolism whereas indoleamine 2,3 dioxygenase (IDO) catabolizes tryptophan through the kynurenine pathway. We analyzed the expression and biological effects of these enzymes in rat and human breast cancer cell lines. We show that rat (NMU and 13762) but not human cells (MCF-7 and T47D) express HO-1. When overexpressed, we found this enzyme to have anti-proliferative and proapoptotic effects by antioxidant mechanisms in these four cell lines. We show that IDO is expressed by rat and human breast cancer cells. IDO inhibition with 1-MT and siRNA leads to diminished proliferation in rat cells. In contrast, HO-1 negative human cell lines increase proliferation upon IDO inhibition. Since we also demonstrate that IDO inhibits the anti-proliferative HO-1, we propose that IDO has opposite effects on proliferation depending on the coexpression or not of HO-1. We also describe that HO-1 inhibits IDO at the post-translational level through heme starvation. In vivo, we show that rat normal breast expresses HO-1 and IDO. In contrast, N-nitrosomethylurea-induced breast adenocarcinomas only express IDO. In conclusion, we show that HO-1/IDO cross-regulation modulates apoptosis and proliferation in rat and human breast cancer cells."
https://openalex.org/W1966222469,"We recently reported that transforming growth factor (TGF)-β induced the neural crest stem cell line Monc-1 to differentiate into a spindle-like contractile smooth muscle cell (SMC) phenotype and that Smad signaling played an important role in this phenomenon. In addition to Smad signaling, other pathways such as mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), phosphoinositol-3 kinase, and RhoA have also been shown to mediate TGF-β actions. The objectives of this study were to examine whether these signaling pathways contribute to TGF-β-induced SMC development and to test whether Smad signaling cross-talks with other pathway(s) during SMC differentiation induced by TGF-β. We demonstrate here that RhoA signaling is critical to TGF-β-induced SMC differentiation. RhoA kinase (ROCK) inhibitor Y27632 significantly blocks the expression of multiple SMC markers such as smooth muscle α-actin, SM22α, and calponin in TGF-β-treated Monc-1 cells. In addition, Y27632 reversed the cell morphology and abolished the contractility of TGF-β-treated cells. RhoA signaling was activated as early as 5 min following TGF-β addition. Dominant negative RhoA blocked nuclear translocation of Smad2 and Smad3 because of the inhibition of phosphorylation of both Smads and inhibited Smad-dependent SBE promoter activity, whereas constitutively active RhoA significantly enhanced SBE promoter activity. Consistent with these results, C3 exotoxin, an inhibitor of RhoA activation, significantly attenuated SBE promoter activity and inhibited Smad nuclear translocation. Taken together, these data point to a new role for RhoA as a modulator of Smad activation while regulating TGF-β-induced SMC differentiation.

Vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) 3The abbreviations used are: VSMCvascular smooth muscle cellTGFtransforming growth factorMAPKmitogen-activated protein kinasePIphosphatidylinositolDNRhoAdominant negative RhoADAPI4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole. differentiation is an important process during vasculogenesis and angiogenesis. It is well known that alterations of VSMC phenotype play a role in the progression of several cardiovascular disorders including atherosclerosis, hypertension, and restenosis (1Kocher O. Gabbiani G. Hum. Pathol. 1986; 17: 875-880Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 2Ross R. Nature. 1993; 362: 801-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (10004) Google Scholar, 3Kocher O. Gabbiani F. Gabbiani G. Reidy M.A. Cokay M.S. Peters H. Huttner I. Lab. Investig. 1991; 65: 459-470PubMed Google Scholar). The developmental origins of VSMC are diverse, including both embryonic mesoderm precursors and the neural crest, an ectodermal cell population (4Hungerford J.E. Little C.D. J. Vasc. Res. 1999; 36: 2-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar, 5Christiansen J.H. Coles E.G. Wilkinson D.G. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 719-724Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). However, the molecular mechanisms controlling the differentiation and development of VSMC, including the intracellular signaling pathways and transcriptional regulation of VSMC-specific gene expression, are largely unknown. It is clear that the identification of these mechanisms may enhance our understanding of VSMC phenotypic regulation and further provide potential therapeutic or preventive targets for cardiovascular diseases. vascular smooth muscle cell transforming growth factor mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphatidylinositol dominant negative RhoA 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole. In vivo studies have shown that TGF-β signaling plays a vital role in VSMC function. TGF-β1, TGF-β receptors (including endoglin, TβR-II, TβR-I and Alk1), and signaling intermediates have all been identified by homologous recombination in the mouse as critical for embryonic angiogenesis. Loss of any of these components leads to defects in smooth muscle cell recruitment and/or differentiation during angiogenesis in the developing embryo and extraembryonic structures (6Goumans M.J. Mummery C. Int. J. Dev. Biol. 2000; 44: 253-265PubMed Google Scholar). In vitro studies have shown that TGF-β1 can induce differentiation of C3H10T1/2 mouse embryonic fibroblasts to a smooth muscle phenotype directly (7Hirschi K.K. Rohovsky S.A. D'Amore P.A. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 805-814Crossref PubMed Scopus (704) Google Scholar). We recently reported that TGF-β induced a contractile VSMC phenotype from neural crest stem cell line Monc-1 and that Smad proteins appeared to be critical in TGF-β-induced VSMC differentiation (8Chen S. Lechleider R.J. Circ. Res. 2004; 94: 1195-1202Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). TGF-β signaling is initiated by ligand binding to the transmembrane receptors, TβR-I and TβR-II, and transduced predominantly by phosphorylation of receptor-associated Smad proteins (R-Smads) (9Piek E. Heldin C.H. Ten Dijke P. FASEB J. 1999; 13: 2105-2124Crossref PubMed Scopus (749) Google Scholar, 10Massague J. Wotton D. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1745-1754Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). R-Smads combine with the common Smad, Smad4, and translocate into the nucleus where they function as transcription factors alone or in association with other DNA binding factors (10Massague J. Wotton D. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1745-1754Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We have demonstrated that Smads play a critical role in TGF-β-induced VSMC differentiation from neural crest cells in vitro (8Chen S. Lechleider R.J. Circ. Res. 2004; 94: 1195-1202Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Much work clearly demonstrates, however, that other pathways including those activated by MAP and JNK kinases, PI3 kinase and RhoA also mediate TGF-β signaling (11Mulder K.M. Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 2000; 11: 23-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar, 12Derynck R. Zhang Y.E. Nature. 2003; 425: 577-584Crossref PubMed Scopus (4324) Google Scholar). The small GTP-binding protein RhoA is expressed in VSMC. RhoA activation was observed in cultured VSMC cells with a contractile phenotype (13Worth N.F. Campbell G.R. Rolfe B.E. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 2001; 947: 316-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 14Bi D. Nishimura J. Niiro N. Hirano K. Kanaide H. Circ. Res. 2005; 96: 890-897Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Other studies have shown that signaling through RhoA controls VSMC function, at least in part, through modulating myocardin/SRF-dependent transcription of SMC marker genes (15Wamhoff B.R. Bowles D.K. McDonald O.G. Sinha S. Somlyo A.P. Somlyo A.V. Owens G.K. Circ. Res. 2004; 95: 406-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 16Mack C.P. Somlyo A.V. Hautmann M. Somlyo A.P. Owens G.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 341-347Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). Recent studies suggest that RhoA downstream target PKN interacts with p38 MAPK to regulate the SMC marker promoter activity in rat pulmonary arterial smooth muscle cell line (17Deaton R.A. Su C. Valencia T.G. Grant S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 31172-31181Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). It has been suggested also that the loss of RhoA expression observed in pulmonary arteries from rats with chronic pulmonary hypertension could be involved in pulmonary artery VSMC dedifferentiation and pulmonary artery remodeling (18Sauzeau V. Rolli-Derkinderen M. Lehoux S. Loirand G. Pacaud P. Circ. Res. 2003; 93: 630-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 19Lu J. Landerholm T.E. Wei J.S. Dong X.R. Wu S.P. Liu X. Nagata K. Inagaki M. Majesky M.W. Dev. Biol. 2001; 240: 404-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Similarly, coronary VSMC differentiation from proepicardial cells also requires RhoA-mediated actin reorganization and Rho kinase activity (19Lu J. Landerholm T.E. Wei J.S. Dong X.R. Wu S.P. Liu X. Nagata K. Inagaki M. Majesky M.W. Dev. Biol. 2001; 240: 404-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). However, It is not known whether RhoA cross-talks with Smad signaling in TGF-β-induced VSMC differentiation. In the present studies, we have evaluated the function of non-canonical pathways in the differentiation of TGF-β-treated Monc-1 cells. We demonstrate that RhoA signaling plays a critical role in TGF-β-induced VSMC differentiation. RhoA kinase (ROCK) inhibitor significantly blocked VSMC maker gene expression and abolished the contractility of VSMC induced by TGF-β. In addition, we demonstrate for the first time that RhoA signaling modulates Smad function during VSMC differentiation through enhancing Smad phosphorylation and regulating Smad-mediated gene transcription.

SBE promoter construct was a gift from Dr. Peter ten Dijke (Leiden University Medical Center, Leiden, The Netherlands). Cell Culture, Adenovirus Infection, and Transfection—Monc-1 and C3H10T1/2 cell culture were performed as previously described (8Chen S. Lechleider R.J. Circ. Res. 2004; 94: 1195-1202Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 22Chen S. Kulik M. Lechleider R.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 1302-1310Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Ligand-induced contractility of TGF-β-induced Monc-1 cells was monitored as follows: Monc-1 cells were treated under indicated conditions for 3 days, and then washed with phosphate-buffered saline, followed by stimulation with DM containing 1 mm carbachol for 1 min. Contractility of SMCs was observed with Nikon Microscope, and the same fields before and after carbachol treatment were imaged (8Chen S. Lechleider R.J. Circ. Res. 2004; 94: 1195-1202Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). DNRhoA, ACRhoA, or green fluorescent protein adenovirus infection was performed following published procedures (20Liu Y. Suzuki Y.J. Day R.M. Fanburg B.L. Circ. Res. 2004; 95: 579-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar, 21Desai L.P. Aryal A.M. Ceacareanu B. Hassid A. Waters C.M. Am. J. Physiol. 2004; 287: L1134-L1144Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Monc-1 cells were infected at 200 plaque-forming units/cell (23Klesse L.J. Parada L.F. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 10420-10428Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and C3H10T1/2 cells were infected at 100 plaque-forming units/cell. The infection was maintained for 48 h prior to TGF-β treatment. C3H10T1/2 cell transfection of SBE plasmid and luciferase assay were performed as previously described (22Chen S. Kulik M. Lechleider R.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 1302-1310Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). RhoA Activation Assay—RhoA activation was determined by affinity precipitation of the active GTP-bound RhoA using a glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion protein of the Rho-binding domain of the Rho effector rhotekin (GST-RBD) following the manufacturer's instruction as described in RhoA activation kit (Pierce). Detection of RhoA was performed by Western blot using anti-RhoA antibody. Immunocytofluorescence, Western Blot Analysis, and Reverse Transcription-PCR—All analyses were performed as previously described (8Chen S. Lechleider R.J. Circ. Res. 2004; 94: 1195-1202Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). PCR primer sequences for α-SMA, SM22α, and calponin have been previously published (8Chen S. Lechleider R.J. Circ. Res. 2004; 94: 1195-1202Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Statistics—All values are expressed as mean ± S.E. Data were analyzed using analysis of variance with pairwise comparisons between relevant groups. A level of p values < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. To study the molecular mechanism of VSMC differentiation, we previously developed an in vitro model showing that TGF-β induced the neural crest stem cell line Monc-1 to differentiate into VSMC (8Chen S. Lechleider R.J. Circ. Res. 2004; 94: 1195-1202Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Further experiments demonstrated that Smad signaling was essential for smooth muscle differentiation. In addition to Smads, other signaling pathways such as p38 MAPK, p42/44 MAPK, PI3 kinase, and RhoA have also been shown to mediate TGF-β function (11Mulder K.M. Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 2000; 11: 23-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar, 12Derynck R. Zhang Y.E. Nature. 2003; 425: 577-584Crossref PubMed Scopus (4324) Google Scholar). We sought to determine whether these pathways were important for TGF-β-induced VSMC differentiation. We used kinase inhibitors to individually block each signaling pathway in Monc-1 cells treated by TGF-β, and then examined the expression of VSMC-specific markers. p38 MAPK, p44/42 MAPK, and PI3 kinase inhibitors did not inhibit TGF-β induction of smooth muscle α-actin (α-SMA), suggesting that p38 MAPK, p44/42 MAPK (data not shown), or PI3 kinase signaling (Fig. 1A) are not important for VSMC differentiation from Monc-1 cells. The ROCK inhibitor Y27632, however, significantly blocked TGF-β-induced α-SMA expression (Fig. 1A). To determine the extent of this effect, reverse transcription-PCR analysis of additional markers was performed. We found that Y27632 inhibited the expression of VSMC markers α-SMA, SM22α and calponin (Fig. 1B). These results suggest that RhoA signaling plays an important role in TGF-β-induced VSMC differentiation. We and others previously reported that treatment of Monc-1 cells with serum also induced VSMC markers (8Chen S. Lechleider R.J. Circ. Res. 2004; 94: 1195-1202Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 24Jain M.K. Layne M.D. Watanabe M. Chin M.T. Feinberg M.W. Sibinga N.E. Hsieh C.M. Yet S.F. Stemple D.L. Lee M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5993-5996Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), although a contractile phenotype was not observed with serum treatment (8Chen S. Lechleider R.J. Circ. Res. 2004; 94: 1195-1202Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Similar to results obtained with TGF-β, VSMC marker expression induced by serum was also blocked following Y27632 treatment (Fig. 1A), suggesting that RhoA signaling plays a role in serum-induced VSMC differentiation also. To detect whether RhoA and TGF-β have a synergistic role in serum-induced SMC differentiation, we used Y27632 and TGF-β type I receptor Alk5 inhibitor, SB431542, to treat serum-induced Monc-1 cells individually or in combination. We found that the maker gene expression was significantly inhibited by Y27632 or SB431542. SB431542 had a much greater effect than Y27632 (Fig. 1C). In addition, the combinatorial use of two inhibitors completely blocked the marker gene expression (Fig. 1C), suggesting that both RhoA and TGF-β are critical and that they have a synergistic role in serum-induced SMC differentiation. Our previous studies showed that TGF-β induced a spindle-like contractile VSMC phenotype (8Chen S. Lechleider R.J. Circ. Res. 2004; 94: 1195-1202Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). To determine whether RhoA signaling is important in this phenotypic conversion, we performed carbachol-induced contraction assay in Monc-1 cells treated with or without TGF-β and Y27632. In this assay, cells were treated with carbachol, a muscarinic agonist, and imaged before and after treatment. Cells responsive to carbachol contract during the course of the assay (8Chen S. Lechleider R.J. Circ. Res. 2004; 94: 1195-1202Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). We found that RhoA inhibitor completely reversed TGF-β-induced spindle-like morphology of Monc-1 cells (Fig. 2E). Carbachol induced a contraction in cells treated with TGF-β (Fig. 2, compare C with D). The addition of Y27632, however, abolished the contractility (Fig. 2, compare E with F). These results suggest that RhoA signaling is necessary for TGF-β-induced contractility of the VSMC phenotype. To further investigate how RhoA signaling regulates TGF-β-induced VSMC differentiation, we first determined whether TGF-β indeed activates RhoA in Monc-1 cells. We performed RhoA activation assay by treating Monc-1 cells with TGF-β for various times, and measuring GTP-bound RhoA. As shown in Fig. 3A, GTP-RhoA can be detected as early as 5 min following TGF-β treatment. The activation can last up to 16 h, the longest time point measured. There was little change in the level of RhoA expression in TGF-β-treated cells (Fig. 3A). C3H10T1/2 cells have been used as an in vitro cell model to study VSMC differentiation (7Hirschi K.K. Rohovsky S.A. D'Amore P.A. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 805-814Crossref PubMed Scopus (704) Google Scholar, 25Bostrom K. Tintut Y. Kao S.C. Stanford W.P. Demer L.L. J. Cell. Biochem. 2000; 78: 210-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Our results showed that TGF-β also induced RhoA activation in C3H10T1/2 cells (Fig. 3B). Because both Smad and RhoA signals play important roles in TGF-β-induced VSMC differentiation, we sought to determine whether RhoA could cross-talk with Smad signals. We used ROCK inhibitor Y27632 to treat Monc-1 cells before, after, or at same time of TGF-β addition. We did not detect the alteration of Smad activation induced by TGF-β, although the expression of the SMC marker α-SMA was blocked (Fig. 4A). These results suggest that the ROCK may not affect Smad activation in our system. To test whether RhoA affects Smad signaling directly, we infected Monc-1 cells with an adenoviral vector expressing DNRhoA and treated the cells with TGF-β for short (30 min and 1 h) or longer (24 h) times and analyzed C-terminal phosphorylation by Western blot. We found that DNRhoA was expressed at a high level in adenovirus-infected cells (Fig. 4B). TGF-β induced phosphorylation of both Smad2 and Smad3 at 30 min after TGF-β addition (Fig. 4B). In DNRhoA-expressing cells, however, the phosphorylation of Smad2 and Smad3 was reduced significantly at 30 min or 1 h after TGF-β induction (Fig. 4B). There was no apparent difference in the level of phosphorylation at 24 h, but the phosphorylation of both Smad proteins was very low at this time even with TGF-β alone. Similar to the inhibition of VSMC marker expression by ROCK inhibitor Y27632 (Figs. 1A and 4A), DNRhoA also blocked SMC marker α-SMA expression while inhibiting Smad phosphorylation (Fig. 4B). These results demonstrated that RhoA is required for Smad phosphorylation during TGF-β-induced VSMC differentiation. To further determine the role of RhoA in Smad activation, we infected Monc-1 cells with DNRhoA adenovirus followed by TGF-β treatment. Immunocytofluorescence staining showed that both Smad2 and Smad3 were translocated into nuclei within 30 min after TGF-β treatment (Fig. 5). However, Smad2 and Smad3 nuclear translocation was significantly inhibited in most of the cells infected with DNRhoA adenovirus, suggesting a role of RhoA in regulating Smad location or function (Fig. 5). Following receptor association, Smad proteins are phosphorylated on C-terminal serine residues, and this phosphorylation is essential for nuclear translocation and transcriptional activity (12Derynck R. Zhang Y.E. Nature. 2003; 425: 577-584Crossref PubMed Scopus (4324) Google Scholar). To determine whether RhoA regulates Smad functional activity, we used transient transfection assays of a Smad-specific reporter SBE along with adenoviral expression of dominant negative and activating RhoA proteins in C3H10T1/2 cells. We could not use Monc-1 cells in this functional assay because we found that combination of transfection and virus infection in Monc-1 caused significant cell death. C3H10T1/2 cells have been shown to differentiate to SMCs with TGF-β (7Hirschi K.K. Rohovsky S.A. D'Amore P.A. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 805-814Crossref PubMed Scopus (704) Google Scholar), to activate RhoA with TGF-β stimulation as do Monc-1 cells (Fig. 3B), and to have a significantly higher transfection efficiency than Monc-1 cells. C3H10T1/2 cells were transfected with the reporter, infected with adenovirus expressing green fluorescent protein, dominant negative RhoA (DNRhoA) or constitutively activated RhoA (ACRhoA), and then treated with TGF-β or left untreated. Luciferase assays showed that DNRhoA significantly attenuated Smad-mediated promoter activation, whereas ACRhoA significantly enhanced Smad-mediated gene transcription (Fig. 6A). To confirm the role of RhoA in regulating functional activity of Smads, we transfected the SBE reporter into C3H10T1/2 cells, and the cells were then treated with a RhoA specific inhibitor C3 exotoxin followed by TGF-β induction (26Watts K.L. Spiteri M.A. Am. J. Physiol. 2004; 287: L1323-L1332Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Luciferase assay showed that C3 exotoxin also significantly inhibited TGF-β-induced SBE promoter activity (Fig. 6B). To test C3 exotoxin function on Smad activation, we treated Monc-1 cells with C3 exotoxin followed by TGF-β addition and performed immunostaining with Smad antibodies. We found that TGF-β induced Smad3 nuclear translocation, indicating Smad phosphorylation. C3 exotoxin treatment, however, significantly decreased the nuclear accumulation of Smad3 (Fig. 7), indicating that C3 exotoxin inhibited Smad3 phosphorylation. Similarly, C3 exotoxin also inhibited Smad2 phosphorylation (data not shown). Taken together, these results demonstrate that RhoA modulates Smad-mediated gene transcription through modifying Smad phosphorylation. Previous studies have shown that Rho signaling is important for the down-regulation of c-Myc protein and up-regulation of p21 protein in TGF-β-mediated growth inhibition of breast cancer cell MCF10CA1h (32Kamaraju A.K. Roberts A.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 1024-1036Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). To determine whether these cell cycle regulators are involved in TGF-β-induced SMC differentiation and whether they are regulated in a RhoA-dependent manner in our system, we overexpressed DNRhoA in Monc-1 cells with adenovirus infection and then treated the cells with TGF-β. Similar to the previous report (32Kamaraju A.K. Roberts A.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 1024-1036Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar), we found that TGF-β significantly up-regulated p21 but down-regulated c-Myc expression in Monc-1 cells. Overexpression of DNRhoA, however, blocked p21 but increased c-Myc protein expression (Fig. 8). These data suggest that as in other cell types (32Kamaraju A.K. Roberts A.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 1024-1036Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar), TGF-β regulates p21 and c-Myc and that these factors may play a role in TGF-β-induced SMC differentiation from neural crest cells. RhoA signaling plays an important role in regulating the expression of these cell cycle regulators. We previously developed an in vitro VSMC differentiation model for the study of TGF-β induction of a contractile VSMC phenotype (8Chen S. Lechleider R.J. Circ. Res. 2004; 94: 1195-1202Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). In this model, Monc-1 neural crest stem cells are treated with TGF-β, and a contractile SMC phenotype results. We further demonstrated that Smad signaling played an important role in this process (8Chen S. Lechleider R.J. Circ. Res. 2004; 94: 1195-1202Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Because recent studies suggest that other signaling pathways are important for TGF-β function also, the goal of this study was to identify other pathway(s) important for TGF-β-induced VSMC differentiation. To this end, our data demonstrated that in addition to Smads, RhoA signaling is another pathway critical to TGF-β induction of VSMC differentiation. The blockade of RhoA signaling with ROCK inhibitor Y27632 significantly inhibited expression of the VSMC markers α-SMA, SM22α, and calponin. ROCK inhibitor Y27632 also blocked serum-induced VSMC marker expression. We previously reported that TGF-β played a critical role in serum-induced VSMC differentiation, which was demonstrated by the blockade of serum effect with type I receptor Alk5-specific inhibitor as well as TGF-β-neutralizing antibodies (8Chen S. Lechleider R.J. Circ. Res. 2004; 94: 1195-1202Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). In the present studies, we further demonstrated that RhoA and TGF-β have a synergistic effect on serum-induced SMC differentiation. Contraction is a primary function of VSMC. VSMC induced from Monc-1 cells by TGF-β displayed contraction upon treatment with the muscarinic agonist carbachol. ROCK inhibitor Y27632 completely reversed the morphological change and abolished the carbachol-induced contraction, suggesting that RhoA plays an important role in the contractility of VSMC induced by TGF-β. This finding is consistent with the previous studies of RhoA activity on SMC function (14Bi D. Nishimura J. Niiro N. Hirano K. Kanaide H. Circ. Res. 2005; 96: 890-897Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 15Wamhoff B.R. Bowles D.K. McDonald O.G. Sinha S. Somlyo A.P. Somlyo A.V. Owens G.K. Circ. Res. 2004; 95: 406-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). RhoA has been shown to regulate coronary or cultured SMC differentiation via cytoskeleton reorganization or actin polymerization through SRF-dependent transcription (19Lu J. Landerholm T.E. Wei J.S. Dong X.R. Wu S.P. Liu X. Nagata K. Inagaki M. Majesky M.W. Dev. Biol. 2001; 240: 404-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). RhoA is also critical in the regulation of contractility of cultured SMC cells (14Bi D. Nishimura J. Niiro N. Hirano K. Kanaide H. Circ. Res. 2005; 96: 890-897Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Our results provide direct evidence for the role of RhoA signaling in differentiation and contraction of VSMC developed from neural crest stem cells. The Smad signaling pathway is the canonical transduction route downstream of TGF-β receptors. However, understanding cross-talk between Smad and other signaling pathways is necessary for determining how TGF-β regulates cellular function. Many studies have tried to link Smad signaling with RhoA activity, especially in TGF-β-induced cytoskeletal organization and epithelial mesenchymal transdifferentiation (EMT) (27Edlund S. Landstrom M. Heldin C.H. Aspenstrom P. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 902-914Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar, 28Nawshad A. LaGamba D. Hay E.D. Arch.

Chem. 2001; 276: 15362-15368Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Although most of the studies showed that actin reorganization and EMT were mediated through Smad-independent RhoA signaling, several evidences showed that Smad was involved in RhoA function. Shen et al. (33Shen X. Li J. Hu P.P. Waddell D. Zhang J. Wang X.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 15362-15368Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) reported that dominant negative Smad3 inhibited the induction of guanine exchange factor NET and the activation of Rho activity. Edlund et al. (29Edlund S. Landstrom M. Heldin C.H. Aspenstrom P. J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 1835-1847Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) found that Smad7 was required for activation of Cdc42, a small GTPase that plays a role in cytoskeleton rearrangement. It is possible that in our system Smad signaling also plays a role in regulating RhoA function. The rapid production of GTP-bound RhoA by TGF-β, however, suggests that the initial activation of RhoA is likely to be Smad-independent. Whether later RhoA-specific effects are dependent on Smad signaling remains to be determined. Other evidence suggests that the Rho pathway may also regulate Smad activation. Recent studies by Kamaraju et al. (32Kamaraju A.K. Roberts A.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 1024-1036Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar) revealed that the Rho/ROCK pathway affects the linker region phosphorylation of Smad2/3 in human breast carcinoma cells. The linker region of Smad2/3 was shown to contain phosphorylation sites for MAPK or Cdk2/4. However, C-terminal phosphorylation of Smad2 and Smad3 and Smad-mediated promoter activation were not altered by ROCK inhibitor in these cells (32Kamaraju A.K. Roberts A.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 1024-1036Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Smads are known to be activated by receptor kinases through C-terminal phosphorylation, followed by nuclear translocation and regulation of gene transcription (12Derynck R. Zhang Y.E. Nature. 2003; 425: 577-584Crossref PubMed Scopus (4324) Google Scholar). Our studies demonstrate for the first time that RhoA directly modulates Smad activity during TGF-β-induced VSMC differentiation. Dominant negative RhoA as well as RhoA inhibitor C3 exotoxin inhibited Smad2 and Smad3 C-terminal phosphorylation or nuclear translocation. DNRhoA and C3 exotoxin also significantly attenuated Smad-mediated gene activation. Furthermore, constitutively activated RhoA enhanced Smad-mediated promoter activity. Most importantly, VSMC marker expression was regulated simultaneously with the modulation of Smad activity, indicating that RhoA may regulate VSMC differentiation through altering Smad activation. Together, these data demonstrate that RhoA can influence Smad signaling either by modulating phosphorylation in the linker region (32Kamaraju A.K. Roberts A.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 1024-1036Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar) or in the C terminus. The effects may be cell type-specific and may serve to help RhoA signaling modulate TGF-β function. The fact that Smad and RhoA signals are both necessary for VSMC marker induction further suggests that both pathways must be activated for smooth muscle differentiation from neural crest cells (Fig. 9). RhoA function in VSMC contractility appears to be independent of its role in modulating Smad activity. This hypothesis is supported by our data showing that ROCK inhibitor Y37632 blocked SMC marker gene activation (Fig. 1) and abolished SMC contraction (Fig. 2) but did not affect Smad phosphorylation (Fig. 4A). In addition to Rho kinase ROCK, another key downstream target of RhoA is a member of the protein kinase PKN family (17Deaton R.A. Su C. Valencia T.G. Grant S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 31172-31181Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Because the affinity of Y27632 for ROCK is at least 20-30 times higher than that for PKN (34Ishizaki T. Uehata M. Tamechika I. Keel J. Nonomura K. Maekawa M. Narumiya S. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 57: 976-983PubMed Google Scholar), Y27632 likely has little effect on PKN while sufficiently blocking ROCK activity. ROCK appears to be important for SMC contraction (14Bi D. Nishimura J. Niiro N. Hirano K. Kanaide H. Circ. Res. 2005; 96: 890-897Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 15Wamhoff B.R. Bowles D.K. McDonald O.G. Sinha S. Somlyo A.P. Somlyo A.V. Owens G.K. Circ. Res. 2004; 95: 406-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar), whereas PKN could mediate RhoA function in modulating Smad activation. PKN has been found to play a role in TGF-β-induced promoter activities of SMC marker genes (17Deaton R.A. Su C. Valencia T.G. Grant S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 31172-31181Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). An alternative pathway for RhoA function is myocardin/SRF-dependent mechanism (15Wamhoff B.R. Bowles D.K. McDonald O.G. Sinha S. Somlyo A.P. Somlyo A.V. Owens G.K. Circ. Res. 2004; 95: 406-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). How RhoA, TGF-β, and myocardin pathways converge to regulate VSMC differentiation and contractility, and whether RhoA modulates Smad activity through PKN remains to be determined. Future work will be directed toward understanding the mechanism by which RhoA induces VSMC contraction and the role of RhoA in modulating Smad activity, especially how RhoA interacts with other components in the Smad signaling pathway. We thank Dr. Aviv Hassid for generously providing the adenovirus vector expressing activated RhoA, Dr. Tetsuaki Hirase for providing us with the dominant negative RhoA, and others as indicated in the text for sharing reagents."
https://openalex.org/W1974829480,"Engagement of the high affinity receptor for IgE (FcϵRI) on mast cells results in the production and secretion of sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P), a lipid metabolite present in the lungs of allergen-challenged asthmatics. Herein we report that two isoforms of sphingosine kinase (SphK1 and SphK2) are expressed and activated upon FcϵRI engagement of bone marrow-derived mast cells (BMMC). Fyn kinase is required for FcϵRI coupling to SphK1 and -2 and for subsequent S1P production. Normal activation of SphK1 and -2 was restored by expression of wild type Fyn but only partly with a kinase-defective Fyn, indicating that induction of SphK1 and SphK2 depended on both catalytic and noncatalytic properties of Fyn. Downstream of Fyn, the requirements for SphK1 activation differed from that of SphK2. Whereas SphK1 was considerably dependent on the adapter Grb2-associated binder 2 and phosphatidylinositol 3-OH kinase, SphK2 showed minimal dependence on these molecules. Fyn-deficient BMMC were defective in chemotaxis and, as previously reported, in degranulation. These functional responses were partly reconstituted by the addition of exogenous S1P to FcϵRI-stimulated cells. Taken together with our previous study, which demonstrated delayed SphK activation in Lyn-deficient BMMC, we propose a cooperative role between Fyn and Lyn kinases in the activation of SphKs, which contributes to mast cell responses.

Normal activation of SphK1 and -2 was restored by expression of wild type Fyn but only partly with a kinase-defective Fyn, indicating that induction of SphK1 and SphK2 depended on both catalytic and noncatalytic properties of Fyn. Downstream of Fyn, the requirements for SphK1 activation differed from that of SphK2. Whereas SphK1 was considerably dependent on the adapter Grb2-associated binder 2 and phosphatidylinositol 3-OH kinase, SphK2 showed minimal dependence on these molecules. Fyn-deficient BMMC were defective in chemotaxis and, as previously reported, in degranulation. These functional responses were partly reconstituted by the addition of exogenous S1P to FcϵRI-stimulated cells. Taken together with our previous study, which demonstrated delayed SphK activation in Lyn-deficient BMMC, we propose a cooperative role between Fyn and Lyn kinases in the activation of SphKs, which contributes to mast cell responses. Receptor stimulation of a variety of cell types induces the early activation of sphingosine kinase (SphK), 5The abbreviations used are: SphK, sphingosine kinase; S1P, sphingosine 1-phosphate; FcϵRI, high affinity receptor for IgE; Ag, antigen; PTK, protein-tyrosine kinase; HuMC, human mast cell(s); BMMC, bone marrow-derived mast cells; IL, interleukin; SCF, stem cell factor; WT, wild type; PI3K, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase; DMS, dimethylsphingosine. 5The abbreviations used are: SphK, sphingosine kinase; S1P, sphingosine 1-phosphate; FcϵRI, high affinity receptor for IgE; Ag, antigen; PTK, protein-tyrosine kinase; HuMC, human mast cell(s); BMMC, bone marrow-derived mast cells; IL, interleukin; SCF, stem cell factor; WT, wild type; PI3K, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase; DMS, dimethylsphingosine. a unique lipid kinase that generates the potent and versatile lipid mediator sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) (1Spiegel S.

Prostaglandins. 2001; 64: 123-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). S1P was demonstrated to function intracellularly, regulating cell survival, cell proliferation, and calcium fluxes (1Spiegel S. Milstien S. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell.

Chem. 2003; 278: 46452-46460Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). However, many of the effects of S1P can be attributed to its role as a ligand for a family of five G-protein-coupled receptors, named the endothelial differentiation gene or S1P receptors (S1P1–5) (4Sanchez T. Hla T. J. Cell. Biochem. 2004; 92: 913-922Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar, 5Spiegel S. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 2000; 905: 54-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). This receptor family, and predominantly the S1P1 subtype, is known to regulate diverse biological functions, including cytoskeletal changes, chemotaxis, vascular development, regulation of endothelial cell function, and lymphocyte recirculation (1Spiegel S.

Biochem. 2004; 92: 913-922Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar). Two distinct mammalian SphKs (SphK1 and SphK2) have been identified, and both kinases efficiently convert sphingosine to S1P (6Liu H. Sugiura M. Nava V.E. Edsall L.C. Kono K. Poulton S. Milstien S.

SphK1 is activated in response to multiple stimuli, whereas SphK2 activation was only recently demonstrated in response to epidermal growth factor (2Olivera A. Spiegel S. Prostaglandins. 2001; 64: 123-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 8Saba J.D. Hla T. Circ. Res. 2004; 94: 724-734Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar, 9Hait N.C. Sarkar S.

In mast cells, the high affinity receptor for IgE (FcϵRI)-mediated activation of SphK1 has been associated with calcium mobilization and degranulation (10Choi O.H. Kim J.-H. Kinet J.-P. Nature. 1996; 380: 634-636Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar, 11Melendez A.J. Khaw A.K. J. Biol.

Exp. Med. 2004; 199: 959-970Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). However, the intracellular role of S1P in modulating mast cell calcium responses remains uncertain, in part, due to the failure to identify the intracellular S1P receptors and the organelle(s) from which the calcium is mobilized. Interestingly, mast cells are one of the few cell types that can secrete substantial quantities of S1P upon stimulation, suggesting an important role for this metabolite in their function (13Olivera A. Rivera J. J. Immunol. 2005; 174: 1153-1158Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Studies on the mast cell tumor analog, RBL-2H3, showed that cell migration to an IgE/antigen (Ag) stimulus required transactivation of S1P1 receptors by endogenously generated S1P. Additionally, these studies demonstrated that S1P contributes to mast cell degranulation through a second receptor, S1P2 (12Jolly P.S. Bektas M. Olivera A. Gonzalez-Espinosa C. Proia R.L. Rivera J. Milstien S. Spiegel S. J. Exp. Med. 2004; 199: 959-970Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). Our more recent studies demonstrated that the Src protein-tyrosine kinase (Src PTK) Lyn is required for the early phase of SphK1 activation in mast cells (14Urtz N. Olivera A. Bofill-Cardona E. Csonga R. Billich A. Mechtcheriakova D. Bornancin F. Woisetschlager M. Rivera J. Baumruker T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 8765-8777Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). This is mediated through the interaction of SphK1 with Lyn, thus promoting SphK1 recruitment to FcϵRI. Nonetheless, because SphK1 activity is delayed but not ablated by Lyn deficiency, we investigated what additional signals might be required for SphK activation. Herein, we demonstrate that both isoforms, SphK1 and SphK2, which are expressed in murine and human mast cells (HuMC), are activated upon FcϵRI triggering. Fyn, a second Src PTK crucial for FcϵRI-mediated mast cell activation (15Parravicini V. Gadina M. Kovarova M. Odom S. Gonzalez-Espinosa C. Furumoto Y. Saitoh S. Samelson L.E. O'Shea J.J. Rivera J. Nat. Immunol. 2002; 3: 741-748Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar), interacted with SphK1 and SphK2 and was required for their activation and for production and secretion of S1P induced by IgE/Ag. Consistent with the previously demonstrated role of S1P in mast cell chemotaxis and degranulation (12Jolly P.S. Bektas M. Olivera A. Gonzalez-Espinosa C. Proia R.L. Rivera J. Milstien S. Spiegel S. J. Exp. Med. 2004; 199: 959-970Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar), Fyn-deficient BMMC failed to migrate toward an Ag gradient and showed defective degranulation. However, both of these responses were partially restored by the addition of exogenous S1P upon IgE/Ag stimulation. Antibodies and Reagents—Mouse monoclonal or rabbit polyclonal antibodies specific to the following proteins were used in this study: phospho-Akt (Cell Signaling Technologies), Akt (Pharmingen/BD Biosciences), anti-Myc (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., Lake Placid, NY), anti-FLAG (clone M2; Sigma), extracellular signal-regulated kinase, Src, Lyn, and Fyn (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA), and anti-V5 (Invitrogen). Antibodies to SphK2 were made by immunizing rabbits (Strategic Biosolutions) with affinity-purified glutathione S-transferase fusion proteins (glutathione S-transferase-SphK2 (Nt) and glutathione S-transferase-SphK2 (Ct)); IRDye™ 800- or Cy5.5-conjugated anti-rabbit and anti-mouse were from Rockland. S1P and sphingosine were from Biomol. Human myeloma IgE (Calbiochem) was biotinylated as described (16Ali K. Bilancio A. Thomas M. Pearce W. Gilfillan A.M. Tkaczyk C. Kuehn N. Gray A. Giddings J. Peskett E. Fox R. Bruce I. Walker C. Sawyer C. Okkenhaug K. Finan P. Vanhaesebroeck B. Nature. 2004; 431: 1007-1011Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). PP2 and LY294002 were from Calbiochem; human or mouse recombinant interleukin-3 (IL-3) and stem cell factor (SCF), and human recombinant interleukin 6 (IL-6) were from PeproTech. The Ag dinitrophenyl-human serum albumin and Streptavidin were from Sigma. RPMI, StemPro-34 culture media, and fetal bovine serum were from Invitrogen, and l-glutamine, penicillin, and streptomycin were from Biofluids. The TNT T7 quick-coupled transcription/translation system was obtained from Promega. Lipofectamine Plus was from Invitrogen. Disposable chemotaxis chambers were from NeuroProbe, Inc.; the Cyquant proliferation kit was from Molecular Probes, Inc. (Eugene, OR); TLC plates were from EMD Chemicals, Inc.; and [γ-32P]ATP and [35S]methionine were purchased from MP Biomedicals and Amersham Biosciences, respectively. Bone Marrow Isolation and BMMC Culture—Fyn–/– (SV129 × C57/BL6 (N4)), Gab2–/– (SV129 × C57/BL6 (N4) (17Gu H. Saito K. Klaman L.D. Shen J. Fleming T. Wang Y. Pratt J.C. Lin G. Lim B. Kinet J.P. Neel B.G. Nature. 2001; 412: 186-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar)), and wild type (WT) mice (SV129 × C57/BL6 (N4)) were maintained and used in accordance with National Institutes of Health (NIH) guidelines. SphK1–/– and the WT littermates were previously reported (18Allende M.L. Sasaki T. Kawai H. Olivera A. Mi Y. van Echten-Deckert G. Hajdu R. Rosenbach M. Keohane C.A. Mandala S. Spiegel S. Proia R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 52487-52492Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar) and maintained as above. Bone marrow was isolated from 5–6-week-old wild-type or gene-disrupted mice, and BMMC were cultured in RPMI medium supplemented with 20 ng/ml IL-3 and 20 ng/ml SCF as previously described (19Saitoh S. Arudchandran R. Manetz T.S. Zhang W. Sommers C.L. Love P.E. Rivera J. Samelson L.E. Immunity. 2000; 12: 525-535Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). Cells were generally grown for a minimum of 4 weeks and used when greater than 95% of the population expressed FcϵRI. HuMC Isolation and Culture—HuMCs were developed from CD34+ cells in StemPro-34 culture medium containing l-glutamine (2 mm), penicillin (100 units/ml), streptomycin (100 μg/ml), IL-6 (100 ng/ml), and stem cell factor (100 ng/ml), as described (20Kirshenbaum A.S. Goff J.P. Semere T. Foster B. Scott L.M. Metcalfe D.D. Blood. 1999; 94: 2333-2342Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). IL-3 (30 ng/ml) was included for the first week of culture. Experiments were conducted on these cells 8–10 weeks after the initiation of culture, at which point the population was greater than 99% mast cells. Transfection of Cells—HEK-293 cells were transfected with V5 or c-Myc-tagged mouse SphK1 or FLAG-tagged mouse SphK2 using Lipofectamine Plus as previously described (7Kohama T. Olivera A. Edsall L. Nagiec M.M. Dickson R. Spiegel S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23722-23728Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar). HEK-293 transfectants were harvested and lysed by freeze-thawing in Buffer A (50 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 100 mm KCl, 10% glycerol, 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 40 mm β-glycerophosphate, 15 mm NaF, 5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, aprotinin and pepstatin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0.5 mm 4-deoxypyridoxine). The cytosolic fraction obtained by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 60 min at 4 °C was used for the measurement of SphK activity or measurements of S1P and sphingosine levels in BMMC. For co-immunoprecipitation experiments, HEK-293 cells were co-transfected with V5-SphK1 or FLAG-SphK2 and murine Lyn, Fyn, or a catalytically inactive mutant (K296N) of Fyn. Forty-eight h after transfection, cells were lysed in Buffer B (borate-buffered saline containing 1% Triton X-100, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, leupeptin, and pepstatin, 5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 50 mm NaF, and 1 mm sodium orthovanadate), and the lysates were used for immunoprecipitation of the Src kinases. Ag Stimulation, Immunoblots, and Immunoprecipitations—HuMCs were sensitized overnight in Stem Pro-34 growth medium without IL-6 or SCF, containing biotinylated human IgE (100 ng/ml) and then triggered by the addition of streptavidin at a final concentration 100 ng/ml as described (16Ali K. Bilancio A. Thomas M. Pearce W. Gilfillan A.M. Tkaczyk C. Kuehn N. Gray A. Giddings J. Peskett E. Fox R. Bruce I. Walker C. Sawyer C. Okkenhaug K. Finan P. Vanhaesebroeck B. Nature. 2004; 431: 1007-1011Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). BMMC were washed and incubated in SCF-free medium for 20–24 h and then sensitized with 1 μg/ml anti-dinitrophenyl mouse IgE in IL-3-free medium containing 2% fetal bovine serum for an additional 3 h. BMMC were washed twice and resuspended in Tyrode's solution/bovine serum albumin buffer (37 °C, 20 mm HEPES buffer (pH 7.4), 135 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl, 5.6 mm glucose, and 0.05% bovine serum albumin). Cells were then stimulated with 100 ng/ml Ag unless otherwise indicated. In some experiments, cells were incubated with LY294002, an inhibitor of PI3K, for 20 min at 37 °C prior to Ag stimulation. Preparation of BMMC lysates, immunoprecipitations, and immunoblotting procedures were as previously described (15Parravicini V. Gadina M. Kovarova M. Odom S. Gonzalez-Espinosa C. Furumoto Y. Saitoh S. Samelson L.E. O'Shea J.J. Rivera J. Nat. Immunol. 2002; 3: 741-748Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar), except that the secondary antibodies used for protein detection were labeled with dyes sensitive to the infrared range and detected by an Odyssey infrared imaging system (LI-COR Biosciences). For immunoblots of cell membrane proteins, cells were resuspended in Buffer A and lysed by freeze-thawing. Cell debris and nuclei were removed by centrifugation at 800 × g for 10 min, and the clarified lysates were centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h. Pellets, containing cellular membranes, were washed twice with PBS and solubilized in SDS-PAGE sample buffer. For co-immunoprecipitations of Fyn and SphK2 from BMMC, cells (6 × 107/sample) were stimulated with Ag and subsequently lysed at 4 °C in Buffer B. In some experiments, BMMC lysates were mixed with lysates of HEK-293 cells transfected with murine FLAG-Sphk2 and incubated for 30 min at 4 °C with gentle agitation prior to immunoprecipitation. Cell lysates were incubated for 3.5 h with rabbit anti-Fyn prebound to protein A-Sepharose. The immunoprecipitated material was washed twice with Buffer B and twice with Buffer A without β-mercaptoethanol or KCl and assayed for the presence of SphK2 activity in Buffer A containing 200 mm KCl as described below. Alternatively, the immunoprecipitated material was resolved by SDS-PAGE and Fyn, and SphK2 was detected by Western blotting. Immunoprecipitations of proteins generated by in vitro transcription/translation were performed as described (14Urtz N. Olivera A. Bofill-Cardona E. Csonga R. Billich A. Mechtcheriakova D. Bornancin F. Woisetschlager M. Rivera J. Baumruker T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 8765-8777Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Briefly, purified human recombinant Fyn, Lyn, or Src proteins and in vitro transcribed/translated human [35S]methionine-labeled SphK1 or SphK2, were allowed to form complexes for 1 h at room temperature and then isolated with the corresponding antibodies prebound to protein G-Sepharose for 2 h at 4 °C. Immunoprecipitated proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE (4–20% Tris-glycine gels), and [35S]SphK1 or -2 was detected by autoradiography. Expression of Fyn Kinase in Fyn-deficient BMMC and Sphingosine Kinase Activity—Fyn-deficient BMMC were reconstituted with wild type or a catalytically inactive mutant (K296N) of murine Fyn using a lentiviral expression vector for transduction. 6Y. Furumoto and J. Rivera, manuscript in preparation. Briefly, cells were transduced with virus and incubated for 72 h prior to use. Transient expression (as determined by green fluorescent protein expression) was ∼70–80%. To determine SphK activity, IgE-sensitized BMMC were activated with 100 ng/ml Ag for the indicated time. Reactions were stopped by the addition of 3 ml of cold phosphate-buffered saline containing 100 μm sodium orthovanadate. Cells were pelleted, resuspended in Buffer A, and lysed by freeze-thawing. The resulting cell lysate was centrifuged at 21,000 × g for 30 min, and 20 μg of the soluble fraction (which also contains cellular membranes) was used to measure SphK activities. SphK activity was measured by incubating cell samples with 50 μm sphingosine and [γ-32P]ATP (0.5 μCi, 1 mm), containing MgCl2 (10 mm) in a final volume of 200 μl of buffer for 20 min at 37 °C (21Olivera A. Kohama T. Tu Z. Milstien S. Spiegel S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12576-12583Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). To preferentially measure SphK1 activity, sphingosine was prepared in mixed micelles with Triton X-100 (final concentration 0.25%), whereas for assaying SphK2 activity, sphingosine was prepared in bovine serum albumin complexes (final concentration 0.2 mg/ml), and KCl in Buffer A was used at a final concentration of 200 mm (6Liu H. Sugiura M. Nava V.E. Edsall L.C. Kono K. Poulton S. Milstien S. Kohama T. Spiegel S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19513-19520Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (563) Google Scholar). 32P-Labeled lipids were extracted and resolved by TLC, and the bands corresponding to [32P]S1P were quantified using an Amersham Biosciences Storm PhosphorImager (21Olivera A. Kohama T. Tu Z. Milstien S. Spiegel S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12576-12583Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Mass Measurement of S1P and Sphingosine—Following Ag stimulation of BMMC, cells (3 × 107 cells/sample) were centrifuged at 4 °C, and supernatants were recovered. The recovered supernatant (1 ml) was further cleared of cells by an additional centrifugation, and S1P in the supernatants was forced into the aqueous phase by the addition of 1 ml of chloroform/methanol (1:1) plus 100 μlof3 n NaOH. Cells were resuspended in 1 ml of 25 mm HCl/methanol, and lipids were extracted with 1 ml of chloroform, 1 ml of 1 m NaCl plus 100 μlof3 n NaOH. Aliquots from the organic phase were used to measure sphingosine levels as described below. The aqueous phase containing S1P was incubated with alkaline phosphatase to dephosphorylate S1P to sphingosine (22Edsall L. Vann L. Milstien S. Spiegel S. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 312: 9-16Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). After lipid extraction, mass levels of sphingosine derived from S1P were determined by a previously described enzymatic method (23Olivera A. Rosenthal J. Spiegel S. Anal. Biochem. 1994; 223: 306-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). In brief, lipids were dried under N2 stream, resuspended, and sonicated in Buffer A containing 0.25% Triton X-100 to form lipid micelles. To these micellar preparations, 5 μl of HEK293 lysates overexpressing c-Myc-tagged SphK1 and [γ-32P]ATP (0.5 μCi, 1 mm) containing MgCl2 (10 mm) were added, and the mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. After lipid extraction, the formed [32P]S1P was resolved by TLC and quantified using a PhosphorImager, and the values were converted into pmol of sphingosine using a standard curve generated with known concentrations of sphingosine (23Olivera A. Rosenthal J. Spiegel S. Anal. Biochem. 1994; 223: 306-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Total phospholipids in cellular lipid extracts were quantified by a colorimetric reaction with malachite green as described (22Edsall L. Vann L. Milstien S. Spiegel S. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 312: 9-16Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Mast Cell Degranulation and Chemotaxis—Sensitized cells were challenged with 25 ng/ml Ag for 10 min, and degranulation was determined by measuring the enzymatic activity of the granule marker, β-hexosaminidase, as previously described (19Saitoh S. Arudchandran R. Manetz T.S. Zhang W. Sommers C.L. Love P.E. Rivera J. Samelson L.E. Immunity. 2000; 12: 525-535Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). Chemotaxis was measured using a ChemoTx disposable chemotaxis system in a 96-well microplate format. Plates were not coated with fibronectin to avoid possible augmentation of chemotactic responses through integrin receptors. Chemoattractants were added to the lower wells, and 1.2 × 105 cells were added on top of the membrane above each well. After3hat37°C, cells on the upper membrane surface were wiped off, and the plates with membranes were centrifuged. Cells that migrated were lysed with CyQuant kit lysis buffer and stained with a green fluorescent dye (CyQuant GR dye), whose fluorescence increases when bound to nucleic acids. A linear standard curve with serial dilutions of the cells for each culture of BMMC (ranging from 100 to 5000 cells) was included to equate fluorescence intensity with cell number. Fluorescence was measured using a FluoroStar fluorescent plate reader. SphK1 and -2 Are Activated upon FcϵRI Triggering of BMMC and HuMC—Aggregation of the FcϵRI in murine BMMC, human BMMC, and RBL-2H3 has been reported to cause the activation of SphK1 (10Choi O.H. Kim J.-H. Kinet J.-P. Nature. 1996; 380: 634-636Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar, 11Melendez A.J. Khaw A.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 17255-17262Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 12Jolly P.S. Bektas M. Olivera A. Gonzalez-Espinosa C. Proia R.L. Rivera J. Milstien S. Spiegel S. J. Exp. Med. 2004; 199: 959-970Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). Another mammalian sphingosine kinase, SphK2, shows more abundant transcript expression in mast cells (12Jolly P.S. Bektas M. Olivera A. Gonzalez-Espinosa C. Proia R.L. Rivera J. Milstien S. Spiegel S. J. Exp. Med. 2004; 199: 959-970Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). Using conditions that differentiate between SphK1 and SphK2 activities (Fig. 1A), we found that SphK2 was a prominent SphK activity in wild type (WT) BMMC (Fig. 1B). To further verify that SphK2 activity can be measured independently of SphK1, we assayed both SphK1 and SphK2 activities in BMMC from SphK1-null mice. As shown in Fig. 1B, SphK1-deficient BMMC had similar levels of SphK2 activity when compared with WT cells. Some residual activity of SphK1 was observed, but this probably resulted from overlapping SphK2 activity, given the noted overlap of SphK1 activity in the SphK2 assay (see Fig. 1A). Human BMMC were reported to express exclusively SphK1 (11Melendez A.J. Khaw A.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 17255-17262Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Using two different antibodies, one raised to the NH2 terminus (amino acids 1–136; anti-SphK2 (Nt)) and the other to the COOH terminus (amino acids 291–618; anti-SphK2 (Ct)) of the murine protein, we detected SphK2 protein in peripheral blood-derived HuMC at levels comparable with BMMC (Fig. 1C, lane 3 versus lane 4, respectively). Anti-SphK2 (Ct) recognized the murine protein but showed poor reactivity to the protein in lysates from various human cell types when compared with anti-SphK2 (Nt) (Fig. 1C, upper panels, lanes 3 versus lanes 4, and data not shown). Nonetheless, a weak reactivity was consistently detected at the apparent molecular mass of 70 kDa. Ag stimulation of IgE-sensitized BMMC and HuMC resulted in rapid activation (with similar kinetics) of both SphK1 and SphK2 (Fig. 2, A–C). The activity of both enzymes in HuMC varied, with SphK2 activity ranging from 8 to 25 pmol/mg/min and SphK1 ranging from 6 to 24 pmol/mg/min (data not shown). As we previously reported for SphK1 (14Urtz N. Olivera A. Bofill-Cardona E. Csonga R. Billich A. Mechtcheriakova D. Bornancin F. Woisetschlager M. Rivera J. Baumruker T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 8765-8777Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), a biphasic induction of both SphK1 and SphK2 activity was found in BMMC, with the first peaking at 30 s to 3 min and the second more sustained phase occurring between 15 and 30 min. The Src Kinase Fyn Is Crucial for IgE-dependent Activation of SphKs and S1P Formation—Our previous study showed that Lyn-deficient BMMC were delayed in activating SphK1 and failed to efficiently translocate SphK1 to Ag-stimulated FcϵRI. This suggested that Lyn played an important regulatory role but also that other molecular events are involved in activation of SphKs. Pretreatment of IgE-sensitized BMMC with the Src PTK-selective inhibitor, PP2, prevented activation of both SphK1 and 2 by Ag (Fig. 2, A and B). In fact, pretreatment of Lyn-deficient BMMC with PP2 also ablated the delayed activation of SphK1 and SphK2 seen in these cells (data not shown). This suggested that a second Src PTK was involved in SphK activation. Thus, we explored whether another receptor-proximal Src PTK, Fyn (15Parravicini V. Gadina M. Kovarova M. Odom S.

BMMC from Fyn-deficient mice showed a severe defect in SphK1 activation and demonstrated complete ablation of SphK2 activation (Fig. 2, A and B). It is noteworthy that the basal activity of SphK1 was unchanged in Fyn-deficient BMMC (WT, 4.76 ± 0.59, n = 9; Fyn–/–, 4.95 ± 1.19, n = 9), but the basal SphK2 activity was significantly diminished (WT, 8.19 ± 1.19, n = 9; Fyn–/–, 3.80 ± 0.86, n = 8, p = 0.0085). This decline in activity was not due to reduced expression of SphK2, as demonstrated in Fig. 2D. Concurrent with IgE-dependent activation of SphKs, WT BMMC showed increased intracellular expression of the SphK product, S1P (Fig. 2E), with a rapid (1–3 min) and a more prolonged phase (20–90 min poststimulation). In agreement with a previous report (24Prieschl E.E. Csonga R. Novotny V. Kikuchi G.E. Baumruker T. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 190: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar), the intracellular levels of S1P progressively decreased between 30 and 120 min, whereas the amount of S1P secreted to the extracellular medium increased (Fig. 2F). Coinciding with early increases in S1P, there was a concomitant decrease in the levels of sphingosine, the substrate of SphKs (Fig. 2G). In contrast, Fyn-deficient BMMC failed to substantially increase the intracellular levels of S1P or secrete S1P following FcϵRI stimulation (Fig. 2, E and F). Likewise, the levels of sphingosine remained unchanged after activation (Fig. 2G). Sphingosine levels were generally lower in Fyn-deficient BMMC as compared with WT. However, the reduced amount of sphingosine was not the cause for the defective SphK activation, since preincubation of Fyn-deficient BMMC with 100 nm to 1 μm sphingosine (which is rapidly incorporated into cellular membranes) did not modify the response to Ag in these cells (data not shown). This was not unexpected, since the basal amount of sphingosine per nmol of total phospholipid (6–12 pmol/nmol phospholipids) in either WT or Fyn-deficient BMMC was much higher than that reported for other cell types (about 0.2 pmol/nmol phospholipids for HL-60, U937, Jurkat T cells, or Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts) (22Edsall L.

Kaufman R.J. Mutat. Res. 2005; 569: 29-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (1368) Google Scholar). Simultaneously, transcription factors are activated to induce the expression of ER-resident chaperones so as to deal with accumulated protein aggregates. In addition, the ER-specific protein-degrading apparatus also becomes activated and eliminates denatured proteins. Comprehensively, this ER response to stress is named unfolded protein response (UPR) (2Breckenridge D.G. Germain M. Mathai J.P. Nguyen M. Shore G.C. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 8608-8618Crossref PubMed Scopus (647) Google Scholar). When the accumulation of protein aggregates is overwhelming or their clean up is somehow hampered, the stress cannot be resolved, and the cell dies by apoptosis. In mammals, at least three ER transmembrane proteins (Ire1, ATF6, and PERK) respond to the accumulation of unfolded proteins in the lumen (2Breckenridge D.G. Germain M. Mathai J.P. Nguyen M. Shore G.C. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 8608-8618Crossref PubMed Scopus (647) Google Scholar). Each of these three proteins has been shown to trigger the expression of proapoptotic genes when a proper ER internal protein balance cannot be restored (3Patil C. Walter P. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 349-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (672) Google Scholar). For its part, Ire1 has been shown to trigger apoptosis via TRAF2-mediated induction of caspase 12 oligomerization and cleavage (4Yoneda T. Imaizumi K. Oono K. Yui D. Gomi F. Katayama T. Tohyama M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 13935-13940Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (683) Google Scholar). Caspases are cysteine-aspartate proteases responsible for the cleavage of cellular substrates in several apoptotic pathways (5Stennicke H.R. Salvesen G.S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1387: 17-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). They can be divided into two groups, initiator caspases and executioner caspases. The executioner caspases, caspase 3 being the best characterized and probably the most conserved and effective among them, respond to direct activation by the initiator caspases. One of the best defined pathways of caspase-dependent death is promoted by the mitochondrion, via release of cytochrome c into the cytosol (6Zou H. Henzel W.J. Liu X. Lutschg A. Wang X. Cell. 1997; 90: 405-413Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2726) Google Scholar, 7Cecconi F. Gruss P. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2001; 58: 1688-1697Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). When this release occurs, a multimolecular complex is formed between the adapter molecule Apaf1 and the initiator caspase 9, namely the apoptosome, a potent trigger of cell death (6Zou H. Henzel W.J. Liu X. Lutschg A. Wang X. Cell. 1997; 90: 405-413Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2726) Google Scholar, 8Salvesen G.S. Renatus M. Dev. Cell. 2002; 2: 256-257Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). In a model suggested by Nakamura et al. (9Nakamura K. Bossy-Wetzel E. Burns K. Fadel M.P. Lozyk M. Goping I.S. Opas M. Bleackley R.C. Green D.R. Michalak M. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 731-740Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar), mitochondria are highly sensitive to Ca2+ release from ER upon UPR, this being achieved by two well characterized types of channels, the inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate receptor and the Ryanodine receptor families (10Pozzan T. Rizzuto R. Volpe P. Meldolesi J. Physiol. Rev. 1994; 74: 595-636Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 11Berridge M.J. Lipp P. Bootman M.D. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2000; 1: 11-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (4372) Google Scholar). In this model, cytosolic Ca2+ would be released from ER and would lead to the activation of several transcription factors, which in turn would induce cytochrome c release from mitochondria and apoptosome formation. Alternatively, privileged transport of Ca2+ between juxtaposed ER and mitochondrial membranes may also sensitize mitochondria to the proapoptotic effects of Bcl2 family members. Caspase 12 has been proposed as an initiator caspase and also as the key molecule in the death-driving force in ER stress (12Rao R.V. Ellerby H.M. Bredesen D.E. Cell Death Differ. 2004; 11: 372-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (812) Google Scholar). In fact, caspase 12 has been suggested as a direct activator of caspase 9, independently of cytochrome c release from mitochondria and apoptosome formation (13Rao R.V. Castro-Obregon S. Frankowski H.

To analyze the possible involvement of the apoptosome-dependent pathway in these conditions, we used ETNA cells, a cellular model that we recently set up and that has the features of bona fide neural precursors (15Cozzolino M. Ferraro E. Ferri A. Rigamonti D. Quondamatteo F. Ding H. Xu Z.S. Ferrari F. Angelini D.F. Rotilio G. Cattaneo E. Carri M.T. Cecconi F. Cell Death Differ. 2004; 11: 1179-1191Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). These cells are derived from striatum primordia of wild-type (wt) or Apaf1-/- embryos (the latter are apoptosome-deficient (16Cecconi F. Alvarez-Bolado G. Meyer B.I. Roth K.A. Gruss P. Cell. 1998; 94: 727-737Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (815) Google Scholar, 17Yoshida H. Kong Y.Y. Yoshida R. Elia A.J. Hakem A. Hakem R. Penninger J.M. Mak T.W. Cell. 1998; 94: 739-750Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (994) Google Scholar)) and are named ETNA+/+ and ETNA-/-, respectively.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESPlasmid Construction—Apaf1 expression plasmid was created by cloning of Apaf1 cDNA under control of the strong promoter CAGGs (CMV/β-actin, a kind gift of Dr. Miyazaki, Osaka, Japan). C9DN and C9wt expression plasmids were created by cloning of caspase 9DN cDNA and caspase 9wt cDNA (see below) under control of the CMV promoter in the mammalian expression vector pcDNA3 (Invitrogen) by using the EcoRI site of the pcDNA3 multiple cloning site. The hairpin expression vector, capable of expressing functional double-stranded siRNAs following transfection into eucaryotic cells, is being described elsewhere. 5A. Di Penta, J. Mayer, T. Achsel, and T. Tuschl, unpublished data. To summarize, the BglII-XhoI fragment of the vector pcDNA3, which contains the CMV promoter, was replaced with a cassette that consists of a BglII-EcoRI fragment with the PolIII-specific promoter of the human H1 RNA gene (X16612) and an EcoRI-XhoI fragment with the stem-loop and a dT6 terminator. The presumed transcription start site is the first nucleotide after the EcoRI site. The stem-loops were always 23 bp in length and closed by an UUCG tetraloop. The 3′-part of the stem-loop was equal to the coding strand of the mRNA, and the 5′-part contained the respective antisense. The following regions of murine caspase 12 were selected: positions 1036–1058, 1071–1093, 1249–1271, and 1680–1702 (numbered as in GenBank™ entry Y13090). The corresponding EcoRI-XhoI fragments were synthesized chemically (MWG, Milan) and subcloned into the stem-loop expression vector. The sequences were verified by dideoxy sequencing (Seqlab, Göttingen).Caspase 9 Site-directed Mutagenesis—The caspase 9 dominant negative cDNA (C9DN) was created by site-directed mutagenesis of the caspase 9wt cDNA (C9wt) contained in the pDrive cloning vector (Qiagen) by PCR using the following mutated oligonucleotides, (hdnf) 5′-CTCTTCTTCATCCAAGCTTCCGGTGGTGAGCAGAAAG-3′ and (hdnr) 5′-CTTTCTGCTCACCACCGGAAGCTTGGATGAAGAAGAG3-′. The mutation of the selected nucleotide determines the substitution of the catalytic cysteine 325 (TGC) of the active site QACGG into a serine residue (TCC).Cell Culture and Treatment—ETNA+/+ and ETNA-/- (murine embryonic telencephalic naïve Apaf1+/+ and Apaf1-/-, respectively) cell lines were routinely cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 units/ml streptomycin and incubated at 33 °C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2 in air. For all experiments, cells were seeded into tissue culture plastics and allowed to attach 24 h before treatment. The seeding density varied according to the type of experiment. Transient expression of Apaf1, C9DN, and C9wt cDNAs (1.5 μg DNA/5–7 × 105 cells) was obtained with Lipofectamine Plus reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. For preparation of mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs), embryonic day 13.5 (e13.5) embryos from heterozygous Apaf1 pregnant females were sacrificed, the heads, viscera, and limbs were removed, and the rest of the bodies was treated as previously reported (16Cecconi F. Alvarez-Bolado G. Meyer B.I. Roth K.A. Gruss P. Cell. 1998; 94: 727-737Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (815) Google Scholar). For pure cortical primary culture, embryonic day 14 (e14) embryos from pregnant Apaf1+/- mice were sacrificed, the cortical hemispheres were removed, and neocortices were treated as previously reported (15Cozzolino M. Ferraro E. Ferri A. Rigamonti D. Quondamatteo F. Ding H. Xu Z.S. Ferrari F. Angelini D.F. Rotilio G. Cattaneo E. Carri M.T. Cecconi F. Cell Death Differ. 2004; 11: 1179-1191Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Tunicamycin, Brefeldin A, and Thapsigargin (Sigma) were added to cultures in Me2SO. Calpastatin, BAPTA, and dantrolen (Molecular Probes) were added 1 h before tunicamycin.Apoptosis Evaluation by Flow Cytometric Analysis—Apoptosis was monitored by evaluation of the pre-G1 cell population, after flow cytometric analysis. Cells were detached by trypsinization and centrifuged at 300 × g for 5 min. After washing in PBS, pellets were incubated with 100 μg/ml RNase (Roche Applied Science) for 20 min at room temperature and stained with propidium iodide (50 μg/ml) at 4 °C for 30 min before analysis. Propidium iodide-stained cells were analyzed using a FACScan Flow Cytometer (Becton Dickinson); fluorescence was measured between 565 and 605 nm.Gene Transfer for Stable RNA Interference of Caspase 12—The four hairpin expression vectors containing four different regions of murine caspase 12 for its RNA interference were introduced into cells by lipofection using Lipofectamine 2000 reagent. To summarize, ∼5 × 105 cells containing 2 ml of the appropriate complete growth medium were seeded in a 35-mm dish and incubated at 33 °C. The next day, 70–80% confluent cells were rinsed with serum-free and antibiotics-free OPTI-MEM (Invitrogen) and co-transfected with all four pcDNA3 hairpin expression vectors (1 μg of each plasmid) and with a plasmid carrying a gene for the hygromycin resistance (100 ng) using 5 μl of Lipofectamine. Cells were incubated at 33 °C and after 4 h were allowed to recover by adding serum to the medium. 48 h after lipofection cells were split into four 90-mm Petri dishes. After growth without selection for a further day, medium containing 200 μg/ml hygromycin to select the resistant clones was applied. After 2 weeks colonies were picked and expanded for the examination of caspase 12 expression by Western blotting.Immunocytochemistry—Cells were cultured in Petri dishes and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 15 min. After permeabilization with 0.4% Triton X-100 in PBS for 15 min, cells were blocked with 2% horse serum in PBS and incubated for 1 h at 37°C with primary antibodies. We used an anti-cytochrome c mouse monoclonal antibody (clone 6H2.B4, BD Pharmingen), an anti active-casp3 polyclonal antibody (Cell Signaling), and an anti-AIF rabbit polyclonal antibody (a generous gift of Guido Kroemer). Cells were then washed three times with blocking buffer and incubated for 1 h with labeled anti-mouse and anti-rabbit secondary antibodies (Alexa, Molecular Probes). After three washes in blocking buffer, cells nuclei were stained with 25 nm SYTOX (Molecular Probes) and examined under a Zeiss LSM 510 Confocal Microscope. Fluorescence images were adjusted for brightness, contrast and color balance by using Adobe Photoshop 7.0. The TUNEL assay was performed by means of the kit from Promega according to the manufacturer's instructions.Western Blot Analysis—Cells were washed twice with PBS and scraped into radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0,5% DOC, 0,1% SDS, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5) with freshly added protease inhibitors. After an incubation for 30 min on ice and a brief sonication, the lysate was centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C, to remove the insoluble cell debris. 25 μg of total protein were separated by electrophoresis through SDS-polyacrylamide gels and blotted onto nitrocellulose. GADD153 and Grp78 were detected with monoclonal mouse-anti-GADD153 or anti-Grp78 antibodies (Santa Cruz) diluted 1:1000 and visualized with an affinity-purified anti mouse peroxidase conjugated IgG (Jackson Laboratories) diluted 1:10,000. A monoclonal mouse anti-β-tubulin (Sigma) diluted 1:1000 was used as a loading control. Caspase 3, 7, 9, 12, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP), and cleaved PARP rabbit polyclonal antibodies (Cell Signaling) were used at 1:1000 dilution.RESULTSWe have previously analyzed ETNA cells in standard and neurodegenerative death conditions, observing a peculiar resistance to cell death caused by the absence of the apoptosome (15Cozzolino M. Ferraro E. Ferri A. Rigamonti D. Quondamatteo F. Ding H. Xu Z.S. Ferrari F. Angelini D.F. Rotilio G. Cattaneo E. Carri M.T. Cecconi F. Cell Death Differ. 2004; 11: 1179-1191Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). To cause ER stress, in the series of experiments we present here we applied three pharmacological agents to the ETNA cells, widely used death inducers that inhibit N-linked glycosylation (tunicamycin, TN), inhibit intracellular calcium pumps (thapsigargin), or block ER-to-Golgi transport (brefeldin A) (3Patil C. Walter P. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 349-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (672) Google Scholar). ETNA+/+ and ETNA-/- cells were cultured in the presence of increasing concentrations of TN (Fig. 1, a and b) and then analyzed by cytofluorometry. A defect of the apoptotic process was observed in the mutant line, when compared with the wt (Fig. 1, a and b). Incubation with TN led to a marked increase in apoptotic ETNA+/+ cells (46.4% at 5 μg/ml), whereas ETNA-/- cells were mostly resistant to this stimulus and showed only a very slight increase in apoptotic cells (4.8% at 5 μg/ml). Interestingly, the UPR induced by TN caused, as a first cellular response, the arrest of cell cycle progression in the G1 phase in cells that were induced to die but did not do so because of the apoptosome deficiency (also at low TN concentration; Fig. 1a, arrow, second panel from left). Similar results were obtained using the other agents, brefeldin A and thapsigargin (Fig. 1, c and d). As a result of apoptosis inhibition, only a few dying ETNA-/- cells could be revealed, during a time course spanning from 6 to 48 h of treatment (Fig. 2a), by the nuclear staining method after 48 h of treatment (Fig. 2b, upper panels), or by the TUNEL method in ETNA-/- cells in marked contrast with wt cells (Fig. 2c). To verify that this resistance to death is a phenomenon also present in vivo,we extended this study to differentiated cells, using primary neurons dissected from the cortical primordia of mouse embryos devoid of Apaf1 and the corresponding wt littermates. Indeed, apoptosis did not occur in primary neurons upon induction by ER stress when the Apaf1 gene was inactivated (Fig. 2b, lower panels). To confirm a key role for a functional apoptosome in ER-induced apoptosis, we transiently transfected a catalytic mutant form of caspase 9 (C9DN), which has previously been reported to act as a dominant negative, into ETNA+/+ cells. When compared with cells transfected with wt caspase 9, the C9DN mutant hampers apoptosis in ETNA+/+ cells, as shown by reduction of caspase 3 and PARP processing (Fig. 2d) and lack of TUNEL positivity (not shown), analogously to what we have shown within ETNA-/- cells with the same stimuli.FIGURE 2Visualization of apoptotic primary or cultured cells upon ER stress. a, cells were treated with TN 1.5 μg/ml for different times, stained with PI, and analyzed by flow cytometry; results are means ± S.D. of three independent determinations. b, SYTOX (green) and cytochrome c (red) staining of ETNA cells (upper panels) or primary cortical cells from wt and Apaf1-/- embryonic brains (lower panels) treated with TN (3 μg/ml) for 48h.

Harding H.P. Zhang Y. Jolicoeur E.M. Kuroda M. Ron D. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5708-5717Crossref PubMed Scopus (650) Google Scholar). Both factors were up-regulated, independently of the presence of the apoptosome, within a few hours from the application of the stimulus (Fig. 3).FIGURE 3Expression of ER-stress-activated genes. Western blot analysis of Grp78/Bip, GADD153/CHOP, and tubulin loading control expression in ETNA+/+ and ETNA-/- cells treated with 1.5 μg/ml TN for different times. Both hallmarks of UPR are strongly up-regulated a few hours after the treatment.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Following the road to death downstream of ER stress, we used immunofluorescence to analyze the occurrence of cytochrome c release from mitochondria and the subsequent activation of an executioner caspase such as caspase 3 in ETNA+/+ and ETNA-/- cells. Upon ER stress induced by TN, brefeldin A, or thapsigargin (Fig. 4a and data not shown, respectively) cytochrome c is released from mitochondria independently of apoptosome formation. In ETNA-/- cells, even if the signaling cascade is intact up to the release of cytochrome c, caspase 3 is not cleaved because of the absence of Apaf1 (Fig. 4a). This is similar to what we previously observed using other death stimuli such as staurosporine, serum starvation, actinomycin D, amyloid-β peptide (Aβ), or transfected mutant superoxide dismutase 1 (15Cozzolino M. Ferraro E. Ferri A. Rigamonti D. Quondamatteo F. Ding H. Xu Z.S. Ferrari F. Angelini D.F. Rotilio G. Cattaneo E. Carri M.T. Cecconi F. Cell Death Differ. 2004; 11: 1179-1191Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). To exclude the involvement of other gene(s) deficiency in this phenomenon, we transfected the ETNA-/- cells with the Apaf1 cDNA sequence controlled by a strong promoter (CAGGs: CMV/β-actin), and we were able to rescue the apoptotic pathway induced by TN in the system. As expected, this cell death coincided with nuclear pycnosis (Fig. 4b).FIGURE 4Molecular characterization of TN-induced apoptosis. a, double-labeling confocal immunofluorescence microscopy of cytochrome c (Cyt c, green) and cleaved caspase 3 (red) in ETNA+/+ and ETNA-/- cells treated for 48 h with TN (3 μg/ml).

Cells were immunostained with anti-cytochrome c (green) and with anti-AIF (red). White arrows point to cells with released cytochrome c. Scale bars: 20 μm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Our next step was to analyze the cascade of events leading to cytochrome c release in this cell system upon TN-mediated ER stress. It has been reported that an executioner caspase, namely caspase 7, can mediate the activation of a signal traveling from the ER to the mitochondria as a consequence of death-inducing UPR (19Rao R.V. Hermel E. Castro-Obregon S. del Rio G. Ellerby L.M. Ellerby H.M. Bredesen D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33869-33874Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (544) Google Scholar). In a first experiment we inhibited caspase activity with the pan-caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-fmk. In this condition, upon TN death induction, cytochrome c is normally released from mitochondria, independently of caspase activity (Fig. 4c, arrows). Furthermore, the proapoptotic flavoprotein apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF) is not released from mitochondria together with cytochrome c after induction of ER stress using 48 h TN (Fig. 4c), as we previously reported for other death stimuli (15Cozzolino M. Ferraro E. Ferri A. Rigamonti D. Quondamatteo F. Ding H. Xu Z.S. Ferrari F. Angelini D.F. Rotilio G. Cattaneo E. Carri M.T. Cecconi F. Cell Death Differ. 2004; 11: 1179-1191Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). This finding also supports a possible caspase-dependence of its nuclear translocation (20Arnoult D. Gaume B. Karbowski M. Sharpe J.C. Cecconi F. Youle R.J. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 4385-4399Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar, 21Arnoult D. Karbowski M. Youle R.J.

However, it should be mentioned that 72 h after the application of the stimulus, AIF disappears from some of the treated cells, probably because it is released in the cytosol and rapidly degraded. AIF release from mitochondria, however, does not always coincide with its translocation to the nucleus, it is not accompanied by an evident nuclear pycnosis nor an alternative cell death morphotype (Fig. 5).FIGURE 5Disappearance of AIF from mitochondria does not coincide with cell death morphotypes alternative to apoptosis.

Cell Calcium. 2002; 32: 235-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (776) Google Scholar), we decided to analyze the role of Ca2+ in ETNA cell death by means of inhibitors of Ca2+ translocation or Ca2+ chelators (Fig. 7a). We used dantrolen, which is a strong inhibitor of Ca2+ release from ER, and BAPTA, which is a powerful Ca2+ chelator within the cytosol. By means of both drugs, we registered a significant decrease of apoptosis when ER stress was induced by TN (Fig. 7a). As a consequence of these results, we can conclude that in our cell system ER-stress-induced apoptosis depends on Ca2+ release from ER during UPR, as well as on the cytosolic Ca2+ concentration.FIGURE 7Involvement of calcium homeostasis in TN-induced apoptosis. a, ETNA+/+ cells were treated with TN (3μg/ml) for 48 h in the absence or presence of dantrolen (Dant, 1 μm) or BAPTA (5 μm), stained with PI, and analyzed by flow cytometry.

https://openalex.org/W2119828989,"Although numerous studies have implicated the sphingolipid ceramide in the induction of cell death, a causative function of ceramide in caspase-dependent apoptosis remains a highly debated issue. Here, we show that ceramide is a key mediator of a distinct route to programmed cell death (PCD), i.e., caspase-independent PCD. Under conditions where apoptosis is either not initiated or actively inhibited, TNF induces caspase-independent PCD in L929 fibrosarcoma cells, NIH3T3 fibroblasts, human leukemic Jurkat T cells, and lung fibroblasts by increasing intracellular ceramide levels prior to the onset of cell death. Survival is significantly enhanced when ceramide accumulation is prevented, as demonstrated in fibroblasts genetically deficient for acid sphingomyelinase, in L929 cells overexpressing acid ceramidase, by pharmacological intervention, or by RNA interference. Jurkat cells deficient for receptor-interacting protein 1 (RIP1) do not accumulate ceramide and therefore are fully resistant to caspase-independent PCD whereas Jurkat cells overexpressing the mitochondrial protein Bcl-2 are partially protected, implicating RIP1 and mitochondria as components of the ceramide death pathway. Our data point to a role of caspases (but not cathepsins) in suppressing the ceramide death pathway under physiological conditions. Moreover, clonogenic survival of tumor cells is clearly reduced by induction of the ceramide death pathway, promising additional options for the development of novel tumor therapies."
https://openalex.org/W1979560148,"Epac-1 and -2 (exchange proteins directly activated by cyclic AMP) are guanine-nucleotide exchange factors for the GTPases Rap1 and -2. Epac2 but not Epac1 was found to possess a RA (Ras association) domain similar to that found in the Ras effector Ral-GDS. This domain specifically bound Ras-GTP, enabling oncogenic Ras to translocate Epac2 from the cytosol to the plasma membrane. Consequently, a small pool of plasma membrane-bound Rap1 was activated at the expense of bulk Rap1 located on intracellular organelles. Whereas translocation of Epac2 was not mimicked by challenge with epidermal growth factor alone, costimulation with forskolin, prostaglandin E2, or an Epac-selective cyclic AMP analog-induced rapid relocation of GFP-Epac2 but not -Epac1 to the plasma membrane in a Ras-dependent manner. Deletion of the cyclic AMP-binding domain overcame the need for nucleotide, suggesting that this domain normally masked the RA domain in the resting GEF. Thus, Epac2 can respond to costimulation by agonists that jointly elevate Ras-GTP and cyclic AMP levels, activating a specific pool of Rap1 at the plasma membrane. Therefore, despite its previous description as a Ras antagonist or independently functioning GTPase, Rap1/Krev-1 may additionally act downstream of Ras in cells that express the cyclic AMP-regulated GEF, Epac2.

Extracellular stimuli promote a large variety of biological events via Ras family proteins. In resting cells, Ras exists in an inactive GDP-bound conformation. Upon stimulation by extracellular ligands, guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) 5The abbreviations used are: GEF, guanine nucleotide exchange factor; DsRed, red fluorescent protein from Discosoma sp. reef coral; GFP, green fluorescent protein; GST, glutathione S-transferase; IBMX, isobutyl 3-methylxanthine; 8-Me-cAMP, 8-(4-chloro-phenylthio)-2′-O-methyladenosine-3′, 5′-cyclic monophosphate; RA, Ras association; PKA, protein kinase A; HA, hemagglutinin; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; EGF, epidermal growth factor; CMV, cytomegalovirus; GTPγS, guanosine 5′-3-O-(thio)triphosphate. are activated that promote the dissociation of GDP, enabling the more abundant GTP to bind. Association with GTP induces conformational changes enabling Ras to bind and activate downstream effectors such as Raf-1, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, or RalGDS, thus transducing cellular signals. The bound GTP is hydrolyzed back to GDP by the intrinsic GTPase activity of Ras to turn off the signal, a process that is greatly accelerated by GTPase-activating proteins (1Bos J.L.

Ras targets share a common Ras association (RA) domain that interacts with its effector-binding loop. The RA domain was first found in RalGDS, a GEF specific for the Ras protein Ral (3Spaargaren M.

The RA domain of RalGDS has similar structure to the Ras-binding domain of Raf-1 despite their low sequence similarity (9Huang L. Hofer F. Martin G.S. Kim S.H. Nat. Struct.

The interaction of activated Ras and RalGDS leads to activation of Ral, thus establishing a small GTPase cascade in which one Ras protein regulates another via the recruitment of a GEF for the downstream GTPase (11Kishida S. Koyama S. Matsubara K. Kishida M. Matsuura Y. Kikuchi A. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 2899-2907Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 12Urano T. Emkey R. Feig L.A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 810-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). The founding members of the Ras family, H-, K-, and N-Ras, are critical regulators of cell proliferation and differentiation (13Campbell S.L. Khosravi-Far R. Rossman K.L. Clark G.J. Der C.J. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 1395-1413Crossref PubMed Scopus (920) Google Scholar). Much less is known about the ∼25 Ras family members that include R-Ras, Ral, Rheb, Rit, and Rap proteins (2Quilliam L.A. Rebhun J.F. Castro A.F. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol. Biol. 2002; 71: 391-444Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Rap1A was described in 1989 as an antagonist of Ras (Krev-1) that, upon overexpression, could revert the transformed phenotype of cells harboring an oncogenic K-Ras mutation (14Kitayama H. Sugimoto Y. Matsuzaki T. Ikawa Y. Noda M. Cell. 1989; 56: 77-84Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (763) Google Scholar). This was thought to be because of its ability to compete with Ras effectors such as c-Raf1 (1Bos J.L. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6776-6782Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). Subsequently it was reported that Rap1A and -B might activate B-Raf, so mimicking Ras in other cell types (reviewed in Ref. 15Stork P.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2003; 28: 267-275Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). More recent studies have revealed that Rap1 also functions independently of Ras to regulate integrins and cell adhesion (reviewed in Refs. 16Bos J.L. de Rooij J. Reedquist K.A. Nat. Rev. Mol.

Ohba Y. Nagai T. Miyawaki A. Matsuda M. Nature. 2001; 411: 1065-1068Crossref PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar) suggested that Rap1 might migrate toward the plasma membrane upon activation, whereas others suggested that internalization of receptors is required for Rap1 regulation (21Wu C.

It is now evident that over 30 GEFs are responsible for activating various Ras family proteins and many of these activate Rap1 and -2 (2Quilliam L.A. Rebhun J.F. Castro A.F. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol. Biol. 2002; 71: 391-444Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These GEFs share a catalytic domain consisting of a CDC25 homology domain and a Ras exchange motif (see Fig. 1A). The diversity of additional regulatory domains results in many extracellular-generated signals converging on Rap1 activators. C3G, the first RapGEF identified, is regulated by interaction with Src homology 3 domain of the adapter protein Crk and is targeted to sites of protein-tyrosine kinase activity via the Crk Src homology 2 domain (2Quilliam L.A.

GRP2 and -3 are regulated by diacylglycerol and/or Ca2+ in a similar manner to protein kinase C (28Kawasaki H. Springett G.M. Mochizuki N. Toki S. Nakaya M. Matsuda M. Housman D.E. Graybiel A.M.

When we identified similar sequences in Epac1 and -2 we wished to determine which Ras protein(s) they bind and how this interaction might affect Rap1 activation. Here we report that Epac2 but not Epac1 binds specifically to H-, K-, and N-Ras-GTP through its RA domain. When co-expressed with constitutively active H-Ras, Epac2 translocates from cytosol to plasma membrane where Ras resides. Whereas this translocation reduces the total Rap1-GTP level in the cell, it activates a unique pool of Rap1 at the plasma membrane. Stimulation of cells with EGF alone did not induce Epac2 translocation but the GEF was rapidly recruited in the presence of growth factor plus cAMP in a Ras-dependent manner. Therefore Epac2 represents a node that assimilates inputs from both growth factor receptors that activate Ras and from G protein-coupled receptors that activate adenylyl cyclase to selectively activate a specific pool of Rap1 at the plasma membrane. Consequently, Rap1 can function as a downstream target of Ras as part of a novel GTPase cascade as well as its previously suggested roles as a Ras antagonist or independently functioning GTPase (1Bos J.L.

Cells were transfected using FuGENE 6 (Roche) as described by the manufacturer. H1299 cells stably expressing GFP-Epac2 were selected, ring-cloned, and maintained on 200μg/ml Geneticin (Invitrogen); cells were further selected and cloned on 100 μg/ml hygromycin B (Roche) for stable expression of pCGN-N-RasWT.

A blunted NheI-EcoRI fragment containing Epac1 was inserted into the blunted EcoRI site of pEGFP-c1 (Clontech). NotI or EcoRI fragments encoding full-length Epac2 were subcloned into pCMV2-FLAG (Sigma) or pEGFP-c1. PCR primers were used to delete residues 650–689 to generate pCMV2-FLAG-Epac2ΔRA, from which a SmaI fragment was inserted into the blunted EcoRI site of pEGFP-c1 to make pEGFP-Epac2ΔRA.

Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE (10% gels), transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore), blotted with M2 anti-FLAG antibody (Sigma), and detected with ECL reagents (Amersham Biosciences). Co-immunoprecipitation—COS cells were transfected with pCMV2-FLAG-Epac2 together with empty vector, or vector encoding HA-tagged Ras proteins. 24 h later, cells were serum starved overnight, and washed twice in ice-cold PBS.

The supernatant was precleared with 30 μl of protein A/G-agarose beads (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). 800 μg of cleared lysate was then tumbled with 10 μg of HA antibody (Covance) for 30 min at 4 °C. 40 μl of protein A/G-agarose beads were added for an additional 30 min. The beads were washed 4 times with 1 ml of Rlf buffer and proteins were detected as above using anti-FLAG antibody. 10 μl of lysates were blotted to confirm equal expression levels of proteins from transfected plasmids. Immunofluorescence—H1299 cells were seeded on glass coverslips and transfected with pEGFP-H-RasLeu-61 and/or pCMV2-FLAG-Epac2. 24 h later, cells were serum starved overnight, fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 10 min, and permeabilized in 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS for 5 min. After blocking in PBS containing 0.2% bovine serum albumin, 2 mm MgCl2, 10% goat serum, 50 mm NH4Cl, 25 mm glycine, and 25 mm lysine for 30 min, cells were washed twice in PBS containing 0.2% bovine serum albumin and 2 mm MgCl2, and incubated with M2 antibody for 1 h, followed by two washes and a 1-h incubation with Alexa Fluor 594-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Molecular Probes). After two final washes, coverslips were mounted onto slides using mounting medium with 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (Vector Laboratories). Confocal images were taken using a Zeiss LSM-510 confocal microscope equipped with laser lines at 364, 488, and 543 nm and PMT detectors. Images were transformed to tiff format and edited using Adobe Photoshop 5.5. For Fig. 5, H1299 cells were transfected with pEGFP-EPAC2 or -Epac2ΔRA and stable transfectants were selected on G418. Individual colonies were ring cloned and those with modest green fluorescent protein (GFP) expression chosen. These cells were plated on coverslips, transiently transfected with pDsRed-K-RasVal-12 or -N-RasAsp-12 (or pFlag-CMV2-M-RasLeu-71, Fig. 4, E and F), and processed as above.FIGURE 4H-RasLeu-61 targets Epac2 to the plasma membrane. H1299 cells were cultured on coverslips and transfected with plasmids encoding GFP-tagged H-RasLeu-61 and/or FLAG-Epac2. GFP was detected at 505–530 nm and the FLAG epitope was detected by indirect immunofluorescence using confocal microscopy. A, GFP-H-RasLeu-61, expressed alone was mostly localized to the plasma membrane. B, FLAG-Epac2 expressed alone resided in the cytosol. In panels C and D, cells were transfected with both constructs. Membrane localization of H-RasLeu-61 is shown in panel C and colocalization of Epac2 is shown in D. Panels E and F show failure of FLAG-M-RasLeu-71 (arrow) to translocate GFP-Epac2 to the plasma membrane. G, more Epac2 was found in the plasma membrane fraction upon coexpression with H-RasLeu-61. H1299 cells were transfected with empty pCMV2-FLAG vector or pCMV2-FLAG-Epac2 alone, or together with pCGN-H-RasLeu-61. A plasma membrane (PM) fraction was collected by sucrose gradient centrifugation and FLAG-Epac2 levels were compared with those in the total cell homogenate by immunoblotting. A nonspecific band migrated just below Epac2 in the homogenate. Data are representative of four experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Plasma Membrane Fractionation—Sucrose gradient ultracentrifugation was performed as described (45Elmendorf J.S. Methods Mol. Med. 2003; 83: 105-111PubMed Google Scholar) except 2.5 mm MgCl2 was included in buffers. Four confluent 100-mm plates of H1299 cells were used for each data point. Briefly, serum-starved cells were washed with ice-cold PBS, collected in 10 ml of 225 mm sucrose, 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 19 μg/ml aprotinin, and lysed by passing through a 26-gauge needle 10 times. The lysate was centrifuged twice at 10,000 × g at 4 °C for 10 min, and the pellet was resuspended in the above buffer and layered onto a 1.12 m sucrose cushion prior to ultracentrifugation, 100,000 × g at 4 °C for 10 min. The interface, or plasma membrane fraction, was pelleted and resuspended in Rlf buffer to solubilize membranes/Rap1 and 20 μg of plasma membrane fraction was tumbled at 4 °C for1hwith20 μgof GST-RalGDS-RA bound to glutathione-agarose beads. The beads were washed 4 times and bound FLAG-Rap1-GTP was eluted and visualized by immunoblotting with anti-FLAG M2 antibody. Plasma membranes were confirmed to be enriched in integrin VLA2 and to lack detectable Golgi marker GM130 by immunoblotting using antibodies from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. 6Y. Li and L. A. Quilliam, unpublished observation. Endosomal contamination was determined by blotting with anti-EEA1 antibody (Transduction Laboratories). Radioactive Assay to Measure Rap-GTP—Rap1-GTP levels were determined by 32Pi labeling of guanine nucleotide pools, immunoprecipitation of Rap1, thin layer chromatography of Rap1-bound GDP and GTP, and detected using an Ambis β scanner essentially as described previously (44Quilliam L.A. Rebhun J.F. Zong H. Castro A.F. Methods Enzymol. 2001; 333: 187-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Statistical significance was determined using an unpaired Student's t test. Ligand-stimulated GFP-Epac2 Translocation—H1299 cells stably expressing GFP-Epac2 alone, or in addition to N-RasWT were seeded on glass-bottomed culture dishes (MatTek, MA). 48 h later, cells were serum starved overnight. Before stimulation, 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, was added to maintain the pH of the media in air. Cells were kept at 37 °C using a stage warmer, and stimulated with 50 ng/ml EGF, 50 μm forskolin, 0.2 mm isobutyl 3-methylxanthine (IBMX), 100 μm 8CPT-2Me-cAMP (BIOLOG), or 10 μm prostaglandin E2, alone or in combination as described in the legend to Fig. 7. Green fluorescence images were taken before and after stimulation using a Zeiss LSM-510 confocal microscopy. For PKA inhibition, cells were preincubated with 20 μm H89 (Sigma) for 30 min prior to stimulation. Epac2 Specifically Binds to Activated H-Ras—RA domains in effector proteins are responsible for coupling them to upstream activation by their cognate GTPases (13Campbell S.L. Khosravi-Far R. Rossman K.L. Clark G.J. Der C.J. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 1395-1413Crossref PubMed Scopus (920) Google Scholar). We previously demonstrated that the Rapspecific exchange factor, MR-GEF, binds activated M-Ras through its RA domain and regulates Rap1 activity (41Rebhun J.F. Castro A.F. Quilliam L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 34901-34908Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Similarly PDZ-GEF1 binds activated Rap1 through a RA domain interaction (39Liao Y. Satoh T. Gao X. Jin T.G. Hu C.D. Kataoka T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 28478-28483Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 41Rebhun J.F. Castro A.F. Quilliam L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 34901-34908Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Because Ras also activates Ral by binding the RA domain of RalGDS (11Kishida S. Koyama S. Matsubara K. Kishida M. Matsuura Y. Kikuchi A. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 2899-2907Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 12Urano T. Emkey R. Feig L.A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 810-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar), we wished to address if Ras-mediated regulation of GEFs is a more global phenomenon. Putative RA domains were identified in Epac1 and -2 (Fig. 1) as well as several other Ras family GEFs that included phospholipase C-ϵ, Link II, and Grasp1 (2Quilliam L.A. Rebhun J.F. Castro A.F. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol. Biol. 2002; 71: 391-444Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Similarly to RalGDS family members, RA domains were located in the C termini of phospholipase C-ϵ and Grasp1 but are found immediately N-terminal to the CDC25 homology (catalytic) domain in Epacs, Link II, MR-, and PDZ-GEFs (Fig. 1A). To establish if the RA-like sequences in Epac1 and Epac2 were functional, and if so, which GTP-bound Ras protein they bound to, FLAG-tagged Epac1 or -2 were expressed in COS cells. Lysates from cells overexpressing these GEFs were incubated with glutathione-agarose beads coupled to GST-fused Ras proteins, as indicated in Fig. 2A, that had been preloaded with GTPγS, a non-hydrolyzable analog of GTP. Any GEF bound to the beads was detected by Western blot with FLAG antibody. As shown in Fig. 2A, Epac2 specifically bound GTPγS-loaded H-Ras. In contrast, Epac1 failed to associate with any of nine Ras family GTPases. The binding of Epac2 to Ras depended on the activation state of H-Ras in vitro because Epac2-containing lysates bound specifically to GTPγS-, but not GDP-loaded GST-H-Ras (Fig. 2B). Under these conditions Epac1 did not bind to either form of H-Ras. Having demonstrated that Epac2 specifically binds GTP-loaded H-Ras in vitro, we next addressed if this interaction also occurs in vivo and whether Epac2 also interacted with K- or N-Ras. Following coexpression of HA-tagged Ras mutants with Epac2, Ras proteins were immunoprecipitated with HA antibody, and Epac2 was found to co-precipitate with oncogenic Ras mutants, but not with the closely related M-RasLeu-71 that has an activating mutation equivalent to H-RasLeu-61 (Fig. 2C). Interestingly, K- and N-Ras bound more effectively to Epac2 than did H-Ras. Binding to activated H-Ras proteins containing Ser35, Gly37, or Cys40 mutations in their effector-binding loop was diminished (Fig. 2D). Collectively, these data suggested that Epac2 specifically interacts with activated H-, K-, and N-Ras in vivo through an interaction with its effector loop. Binding of Epac2 to Ras-GTP Is Dependent on the RA Domain of the GEF—To establish that association of Ras-GTP with Epac2 was mediated by the putative RA domain of the GEF rather than the Rap1-binding CDC25 homology domain, we deleted residues 650–689 that are predicted to form the Ras binding surface of the RA domain (9Huang L. Hofer F. Martin G.S. Kim S.H. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 422-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar), and examined the ability of this Epac2ΔRA mutant to bind activated H-Ras. GTPγS-loaded H-Ras failed to pull down Epac2ΔRA in vitro under conditions that supported an interaction with full-length Epac2 (Fig. 2B). Furthermore, no Epac2ΔRA was co-immunoprecipitated with the active mutant H-RasVal-12, despite efficient coprecipitation of wild type Epac2 in vivo (Fig. 3A), indicating that the RA domain is required for the binding of Epac2 to activated H-Ras. Epac2ΔRA retained its ability to activate Rap1 in vivo (Fig. 3B), demonstrating"

Recently, we have established that protein RPE65 is the isomerohydrolase catalyzing this reaction. The present study investigated if metal ions are required for the isomerohydrolase activity of RPE65. The conversion of all-trans-[3H]retinol to 11-cis-[3H]retinol was used as the measure for isomerohydrolase activity. Metal chelators 2,2′-bipyridine and 1,10-phenanthroline both showed dose-dependent inhibitions of the isomerohydrolase activity in bovine RPE microsomes, with IC50 values of 0.5 and 0.2 mm, respectively. In the same reaction systems, however, lecithin-retinol acyltransferase (LRAT) activity was not affected by these metal chelators. The isomerohydrolase activity inhibited by the metal chelators was restored by FeSO4 but not by CuSO4, ZnCl2, or MgCl2. Moreover, addition of Fe(III) citrate or FeCl3 did not restore the activity, indicating that Fe2+ is the metal ion essential for the isomerohydrolase activity. To confirm this result in recombinant RPE65, we expressed RPE65 in a 293A cell line stably expressing LRAT. In vitro activity assay showed that both metal chelators inhibited isomerohydrolase activity of recombinant RPE65. The addition of FeSO4 restored the enzymatic activity of the recombinant RPE65. Further, two specific iron-staining methods showed that purified RPE65 contains endogenous iron. Inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry measurements showed that bovine RPE65 binds iron ion with a stoichiometry of 0.8 ± 0.1.

These results indicate that RPE65 is an iron-dependent isomerohydrolase in the visual cycle Photon absorption by the visual pigments results in isomerization of 11-cis-retinal, the chromophore, to all-trans-retinal and, subsequently, triggers a phototransduction cascade (1McBee J.K. Palczewski K. Baehr W. Pepperberg D.R. Prog. Retin. Eye Res. 2001; 20: 469-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). Obviously, an efficient regeneration of 11-cis-retinal is necessary for the continuous phototransduction process and normal vision. 11-cis-Retinal is regenerated through a series of sequential reactions termed the visual cycle (2Rando R.R. Chem. Rev. 2001; 101: 1881-1896Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). The most critical step of the visual cycle is the isomerization of all-trans-retinol to 11-cis-retinol in the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE). 3The abbreviations used are: RPE, retinal pigment epithelium; CRALBP, cellular retinaldehyde-binding protein; DMF, dimethyl formamide; ICP-MS, inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry; LRAT, lecithin-retinol acyltransferase; Ad-RPE65, adenovirus-expressing RPE65; HPLC, high-performance liquid chromatography; BSA, bovine serum albumin; CHAPS, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid. It has been shown that all-trans-retinol must be first acylated by lecithin-retinol acyltransferase (LRAT), and the resultant retinyl ester serves as a substrate for the enzyme termed isomerohydrolase (3Moiseyev G.

Although the overall identity of RPE65 and carotenoid oxygenases is not high (37% for the mouse protein (17Redmond T.M. Gentleman S. Duncan T. Yu S. Wiggert B. Gantt E. Cunningham Jr., F.X. J. Biol.

Recently, it has been shown that the 4 conserved histidines are essential for the catalytic activity of β-carotene monooxygenases (20Poliakov E. Gentleman S. Cunningham Jr., F.X. Miller-Ihli N.J.

Mutations of these histidines impaired iron binding to β-carotene monooxygenase, and thus, it was concluded that these histidines coordinate iron required for its catalytic activity (20Poliakov E.

Recently, we and others have shown that recombinant RPE65 protein has the isomerohydrolase activity in vitro, indicating that RPE65 is the isomerohydrolase in the visual cycle (5Moiseyev G. Chen Y.

In the present study, we show that iron(II) is required for the isomerohydrolase activity of native RPE65 from RPE microsomes as well as RPE65 expressed in 293A cells. We have further demonstrated that purified RPE65 protein contains endogenous iron. Cell Culture—The QBI-293A cell line for the adenovirus packaging was purchased from Qbiogene (Irvine, CA). The QBI-293A cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified eagle medium (Invitrogen) containing 5% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen) supplemented with 100 units/ml penicillin G, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 250 ng/ml amphotericin. Adenoviral Vector Construction—Briefly, to construct an adenovirus expressing RPE65 (Ad-RPE65), a full-length human RPE65 cDNA was cloned into the pShuttle vector (Qbiogene, Canada). The purified plasmid DNA was digested with PmeI then co-transformed with pAdEasy-1 vector (Qbiogene) into BJ5183 competent cells. The recombinant Ad-RPE65 viral DNA was digested with PacI, purified, and transfected into QBI-293A cells to generate virus particles. The resulting virus (Ad-RPE65) was propagated in QBI-293A cells and purified by cesium chloride gradient centrifugation. Adenovirus infectious titer was determined by plaque formation assay as recommended by manufacturer and the virus titer expressed as plaque-forming units/ml. Co-expression of LRAT and RPE65—QBI-293A cells were cultured until 70-75% confluency (1.2-1.3 × 107 cells/15-cm dish). A human LRAT cDNA in the pcDNA6 (Invitrogen) plasmid was linearized and transfected into the cells. Colonies stably expressing LRAT were selected using a medium containing 10 μg/ml blasticidin (Invitrogen) as described previously (21Takahashi Y. Moiseyev G. Chen Y. Ma J.X. FEBS Lett. 2005; 579: 5414-5418Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The selected colonies were subcloned to generate a 293A cell line stably expressing LRAT (293A-LRAT). The 293A-LRAT cells were infected with Ad-RPE65 and cultured for another 24 h. The cells were harvested with a cell scraper (Sarstedt, Newton, NC) and rinsed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, then stored at -80 °C until used. Isomerohydrolase Activity Assay—Bovine RPE microsomes were prepared from fresh cow eyes as described previously (3Moiseyev G. Crouch R.K. Goletz P. Oatis Jr., J. Redmond T.M. Ma J.X. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 2229-2238Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). All-trans-[11,12-3H]retinol in ethanol (1 mCi/ml, 52 Ci/mmol, PerkinElmer Life Sciences) was dried under argon and re-suspended in the same volume of dimethyl formamide (DMF). For each reaction, 2 μl of the non-diluted all-trans-[11,12-3H]retinol in DMF and 10 μg of bovine RPE microsomes or 250 μg of 293A-LRAT cell homogenate expressing both LRAT and RPE65 were added into 200 μl of a reaction buffer (10 mm 1,3-bis[tris(hydroxymethyl)methylamino]propane, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl) containing 0.5% BSA and 25 μm cellular retinaldehyde-binding protein (CRALBP) (3Moiseyev G.

Biol. 1998; 89: 91-104PubMed Google Scholar). After 2-h incubation in the dark at 37 °C, retinoids generated were extracted by the addition of 300 μl of cold methanol and 300 μl of hexane. The upper organic phase was collected and analyzed by normal phase HPLC as described previously (3Moiseyev G. Crouch R.K. Goletz P. Oatis Jr., J. Redmond T.M. Ma J.X. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 2229-2238Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). The identity of each retinoid was based on comparison to retention times of known retinoid standards. Metal Chelation—The 1,10-phenanthroline and 2,2′-bipyridine solutions were prepared as stocks of 20-1000 mm in DMF and added into reaction together with 10 μg of bovine microsomal proteins or 250 μg of total homogenate of 293A-LRAT cells expressing both RPE65 and LRAT. The total volume of phenanthroline and 2,2′-bipyridine solutions added to the reaction did not exceed 2 μl to avoid the possible effect of DMF on isomerohydrolase activity. The total volume of the reaction was 200 μl, and the reaction conditions were the same as described above. For the control, the same volume of DMF was added without the chelators. Metal ions were added into the reaction 1 h after the addition of the metal chelators to regenerate the isomerohydrolase activity. Purification of Bovine RPE65—Bovine RPE microsomes were prepared as described (3Moiseyev G. Crouch R.K. Goletz P. Oatis Jr., J. Redmond T.M. Ma J.X. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 2229-2238Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). The microsomal protein was solubilized in 1% CHAPS, 20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0 and centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 30 min. The detergent-soluble fractions were passed through a DEAE-Sepharose anion exchange column (1 × 20 cm) equilibrated with a loading buffer. A NaCl gradient from 0 to 0.5 m in the same loading buffer was used for the elution of proteins from the column. Collected gradient fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting (3Moiseyev G. Crouch R.K. Goletz P. Oatis Jr., J. Redmond T.M. Ma J.X. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 2229-2238Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). The fractions that had the highest RPE65 protein as shown in Western blotting were combined and concentrated using a Centricon 10,000-kDa cut-off ultrafiltration device (Millipore, Billerica, MA). To confirm the purity of the purified RPE65, the purified protein was resolved on 10% polyacrylamide gels containing 0.5% SDS as described previously (24Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207192) Google Scholar). The SDS-PAGE gels were stained with 0.25% Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 in 40% methanol and 7% acetic acid, and destained using 7% acetic acid and 20% ethanol. Staining of Iron-containing Proteins in Native Polyacrylamide Gels— Native PAGE was performed as described by Laemmli (24Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207192) Google Scholar) except that SDS was omitted from the gels and buffers. Pre-cast native polyacrylamide gradient gels (4-20%) were purchased from Jule Inc. (Milford, CT). Two different methods were used for specific staining of iron bound to proteins loaded in the gel. The first method was based on the ability of iron to catalyze the oxidation of diaminobenzoate by H2O2 (25Kuo C.F. Fridovich I. Anal. Biochem. 1988; 170: 183-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). After electrophoresis, the gel was immersed in 50 mm sodium acetate at pH 5.0. Hydrogen peroxide was added to 40 mm, and diaminobenzoic acid dihydrochloride from freshly prepared 0.8 m stock solution was added to 80 mm. The gel was gently agitated until the colored bands appeared (usually about 1 h). The gel was rinsed in water and then placed in 7% acetic acid. The gels were analyzed by the imager Chemi Genius2 (Syngene, Frederick, MD) within several hours after staining. The second iron staining method is based on the reaction of potassium ferricyanide with iron(II) ions (26Leong L.M. Tan B.H. Ho K.K. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 207: 317-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) as shown in Reaction 1 as follows. Fe2+K3FE(CN)6→KFe[Fe(CN)6]+2K+(Eq. 1) Following electrophoresis, the gel was stained in the dark by freshly prepared 100 mm potassium ferricyanide in 50 mm Tris-HCl and 100 mm NaCl at pH 7.5 for 10 min. A solution consisting of 10% trichloroacetic acid and 10% methanol was prepared immediately prior to being used as the color development solution. The color development was carried out for 2 h. The development solution was changed at least two times to reduce the background. The gel was recorded and analyzed by the imager as described above. Measurements of Stoichiometry of Iron in RPE65 Using ICP-MS—The iron concentration measurements were performed by Elemental Analysis, Inc. (Lexington, KY). High resolution inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) was used to measure iron concentrations in RPE65 purified from bovine RPE. The RPE65 protein aliquot (50 μl) was weighed into a precleaned, preweighed trace metal-free polypropylene centrifuge tube. Concentrated nitric acid (HNO3, Fisher Brand Optima Grade, 250 μl) was added, and the tube was allowed to sit overnight. Hydrogen peroxide solution (30% H2O2, Fluka Trace-SelectUltra, 80 μl) was added, and the tube was capped. The sample was placed into an ultrasonic bath at 60 °C for 2 h. The clear digestate was then made up to a volume of ∼5 ml with water (ultrapure, 18.2 mΩ-cm deionized water). The tube was reweighed, and then a solution of internal standard (scandium) was added and weighed. Instrument calibration standards were prepared from a commercial High-Purity multielement stock solution. The scandium internal standard was added to the calibration standards at the same level as in the samples (20 ppb). Five standard points (0, 2, 5, 10, and 20 ppb) were used to generate a linear calibration curve. The correlation coefficient (R) of this curve was 0.99996. The instrument limit of detection was calculated as three times the standard deviation of ten measurements of iron in a blank solution. The limit of detection in sample is the product of the instrument limit of detection and the sample dilution factor. Inhibition of the Isomerohydrolase Activity in Bovine RPE by Metal Chelators—To determine if endogenous metal ions are necessary for the isomerohydrolase activity, we used two common metal chelating agents, 2,2′-bipyridine and 1,10-phenanthroline, in the isomerohydrolase activity assay. These chelating agents are lipophilic and can efficiently penetrate the cell membranes. As the isomerohydrolase activity is associated with the RPE microsomal membranes, we expected that these agents would be efficient in extracting metal ions from membrane-associated enzymes. Although all-trans-retinyl ester is known to be the substrate of the isomerohydrolase, the poor solubility of retinyl ester in the reaction system limits its use in this assay. Therefore, all-trans-[3H]retinol was used to generate retinyl esters by LRAT in the microsomes of the RPE; these esters were then isomerized/hydrolyzed to 11-cis-[3H]retinol. Incubation of the bovine RPE microsomes with all-trans-[3H]retinol resulted in the formation of retinyl esters and 11-cis-[3H]retinol as shown by the HPLC elution profile (Fig. 1A). As expected, the addition of 5 mm 1,10-phenanthroline or 2,2′-bipyridine to the RPE microsomes resulted in an almost complete inhibition of the 11-cis-[3H]retinol generation (Fig. 1, B and C), whereas the production of retinyl ester was not affected significantly, suggesting that LRAT activity is not affected by these metal chelators. The inhibition of isomerohydrolase activity appeared to be chelator concentration-dependent (Fig. 1, D and E). The apparent IC50 is 0.2 mm for phenanthroline and 0.5 mm for bipyridine. These results indicate that some endogenous metal ion is essential for the isomerohydrolase activity. Requirement of Ferrous Ion for Retinol Isomerohydrolase Activity—To determine which particular metal ion is required for the isomerohydrolase activity, we added back various metal ions individually into the isomerohydrolase assay mixture after inhibition of the enzymatic activity by 5 mm 1,10-phenanthroline. After bovine RPE microsomes were preincubated with all-trans-[3H]retinol and 5 mm of phenanthroline for 1 h, various metal ions were added separately into the reaction system and incubated for another 1 h. The isomerohydrolase activity was evaluated by the production of 11-cis-[3H]retinol. Of all the metal ions tested, only 6 mm FeSO4 (Fig. 2B) and 6 mm ferrous ammonium sulfate (data not shown) partially restored the isomerohydrolase activity. In contrast, the addition of the same concentrations of CuSO4, ZnCl2, or MgCl2 did not result in the formation of detectable 11-cis-[3H]retinol (Fig. 2, C-E), demonstrating that ferrous ion is specifically required for the isomerohydrolase activity. Moreover, the addition of 6 mm FeCl3 (data not shown) or ferric citrate (Fig. 2F) did not restore the isomerohydrolase activity, indicating that Fe2+ rather than Fe3+ is the active form of metal ion in the isomerohydrolase. Further, we examined if the restoration of the isomerohydrolase activity is dependent on the concentration of the Fe2+ added into the reaction. The results showed that generated 11-cis-retinol increased with FeSO4 concentrations within a range of 0-6 mm (Fig. 3). At concentrations higher than 6 mm, further increases of FeSO4 decreased the isomerohydrolase activity (Fig. 3). Isomerohydrolase Activity of Recombinant RPE65 Is Inhibited by Metal Chelators and Restored by Exogenous Fe(II)—Recently, we have shown that recombinant RPE65 expressed in the 293 cell line has robust isomerohydrolase activity (5Moiseyev G. Chen Y. Takahashi Y. Wu B.X. Ma J.X. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 12413-12418Crossref PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar). Here we have examined if the metal chelators inhibit the enzymatic activity of recombinant RPE65. The in vitro isomerohydrolase assay showed that recombinant RPE65, when co-expressed with LRAT, generated significant amount of 11-cis-retinol from all-trans-retinol in the absence of the chelators (Fig. 4, A and B). The addition of 1 mm of bipyridine significantly decreases the 11-cis-retinol generated by the recombinant RPE65 (Fig. 4C). Similar inhibition of the enzymatic activity was observed for another chelator 1,10-phenanthroline (data not shown). Consistent with the observation in bovine RPE microsomes, the 11-cis-retinol production was restored when 6 mm FeSO4 was added to the reaction 1 h after the metal chelating (Fig. 4D), demonstrating that iron(II) is essential for the isomerohydrolase activity of recombinant RPE65. Detection of Iron in Purified RPE65 Protein—As RPE65 was found to be the isomerohydrolase of the visual cycle (5Moiseyev G. Chen Y. Takahashi Y. Wu B.X. Ma J.X. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 12413-12418Crossref PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar, 6Jin M. Li S. Moghrabi W.N. Sun H. Travis G.H. Cell. 2005; 122: 449-459Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar) and it is homologous to the known iron-containing monooxygenases (17Redmond T.M. Gentleman S. Duncan T.

Palczewski K. Zack D.J. Genomics. 2001; 72: 193-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar), it was of interest to determine if RPE65 is an iron-containing protein. RPE65 was purified from the RPE microsomes as described under “Experimental Procedures.” SDS-PAGE demonstrated that the purified bovine RPE65 is electrophoretically homogeneous (Fig. 5A). The identity of the purified RPE65 was confirmed by Western blot analysis as described previously (5Moiseyev G. Chen Y. Takahashi Y. Wu B.X. Ma J.X. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 12413-12418Crossref PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar). We employed a sensitive assay for iron detection based on the ability of iron to catalyze the oxidation of diaminobenzoate by hydrogen peroxide (25Kuo C.F. Fridovich I. Anal. Biochem. 1988; 170: 183-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The diaminobenzoate is oxidized by H2O2 to a brown insoluble pigment that can visualize as little as 5 ng of protein-bound iron (25Kuo C.F. Fridovich I. Anal. Biochem. 1988; 170: 183-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Purified bovine RPE65 (50 μg, molecular mass of 61 kDa (27Ma J. Zhang J. Othersen K.L. Moiseyev G. Ablonczy Z. Redmond T.M. Chen Y. Crouch R.K. Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2001; 42: 1429-1435PubMed Google Scholar)) was loaded on a native polyacrylamide gel, side by side with a positive control, human transferrin (Sigma, 100 μg, molecular mass of 78 kDa), a well known iron-binding protein (28Baker H.M. Anderson B.F. Baker E.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 3579-3583Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar), and with bovine serum albumin (BSA, 100 μg) as negative control. As shown by the specific iron staining, both the purified RPE65 and transferrin showed intensive iron staining. It is noteworthy that the RPE65 band in the native gel appears to be smear, possibly due to partial precipitation of the protein and different secondary structures of the protein in the absence of detergents. As expected, BSA did not show any detectable iron staining, demonstrating the specificity of the staining. The dialysis of bovine RPE65 against 20 mm bipyridine in the activity measurement buffer results in the absence of iron staining. To further confirm that RPE65 is an iron-containing protein, we also used a second method for iron staining based on the well known reaction of potassium ferricyanide with protein-bound iron atoms to form royal blue complexes (26Leong L.M. Tan B.H. Ho K.K. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 207: 317-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Transferrin and BSA were again used as positive and negative controls, respectively. The result showed that RPE65 protein as well as transferrin was stained, whereas BSA was negative in staining (Fig. 5C). These iron-specific staining results demonstrated that RPE65 is bound by endogenous iron. The stoichiometry of iron binding in purified bovine RPE65 was determined using ICP-MS. We also used human transferrin and bovine serum albumin as positive and negative controls, respectively (Table 1). The protein concentrations for all samples were 4.4 μm. The iron concentration in bovine RPE65 was measured in duplicate. We obtained an iron stoichiometry of 0.8 ± 0.1 for bovine RPE65 (Table 1). The iron stoichiometry for human transferrin was calculated to be 1.9, which agrees well with documented data showing that each transferrin molecule contains 2 iron atoms (28Baker H.M. Anderson B.F. Baker E.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 3579-3583Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). As expected, the bovine serum albumin sample iron content was close to the level of detection.TABLE 1Iron analysis in purified protein by high resolution ICP-MSSample indentificationIronLODaLOD, limit of detection in sample.IronStoichiometrybStoichiometry represents the ratio of molar concentration of iron to molar concentration of the proteins in the samples (4.4 μm).ppbμmHuman transferrin4714.28.41.91Bovine RPE65 sample 1187223.30.75Bovine RPE65 sample 2213203.80.86Bovine serum albumin8.54.40.150.03a LOD, limit of detection in sample.b Stoichiometry represents the ratio of molar concentration of iron to molar concentration of the proteins in the samples (4.4 μm). Open table in a new tab Conversion of all-trans-retinyl ester to 11-cis-retinol catalyzed by the isomerohydrolase is a critical step in the regeneration of 11-cis-retinal in the visual cycle and thus, essential for normal vision. Although the isomerohydrolase activity has been known for almost 20 years, the enzyme that catalyzes this reaction has never been purified. Recently, we and others have established that RPE65 is the isomerohydrolase in the visual cycle (5Moiseyev G. Chen Y. Takahashi Y. Wu B.X. Ma J.X. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 12413-12418Crossref PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar, 6Jin M. Li S. Moghrabi W.N. Sun H. Travis G.H. Cell. 2005; 122: 449-459Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). In the present study, we provide the first direct evidence indicating that RPE65 is an iron-binding protein, and endogenous iron(II) is an essential co-factor for the isomerohydrolase. This finding provides new insights into the mechanism for the isomerohydrolase activity. The present study showed that deprivation of metal ions from the RPE microsomes by common metal chelators 1,10-phenathroline and 2,2′-bipyridine inhibits the isomerohydrolase activity, suggesting that some endogenous metal ion bound to the isomerohydrolase is required for its activity. Previous studies showed that the isomerohydrolase activity is associated with the microsomal membranes of the RPE (3Moiseyev G. Crouch R.K. Goletz P. Oatis Jr., J. Redmond T.M. Ma J.X. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 2229-2238Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 29Rando R.R. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 595-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 30Stecher H. Gelb M.H. Saari J.C. Palczewski K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8577-8585Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar), which is consistent with the finding of its hydrophobic substrate, all-trans-retinyl ester (3Moiseyev G. Crouch R.K. Goletz P. Oatis Jr., J. Redmond T.M. Ma J.X. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 2229-2238Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Therefore, we used hydrophobic metal chelators, 1,10-phenanthroline and 2,2′-bipyridine, to facilitate their penetration into the membrane. As a result of the metal chelating, the isomerohydrolase activity was abolished by these chelators. In the same reaction mixture, however, the LRAT activity is not inhibited by these chelators, indicating that LRAT does not require endogenous metal ions for its enzymatic activity. Furthermore, the inhibition of isomerohydrolase by these two metal chelators resulted in increased levels of retinyl ester, further supporting the previous finding that retinyl ester is the substrate of the isomerohydrolase (3Moiseyev G. Crouch R.K. Goletz P. Oatis Jr., J. Redmond T.M. Ma J.X. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 2229-2238Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). It is noteworthy that the IC50 values for both metal chelators used in the study are relatively high, consistent with the high concentrations of metal chelators required to inhibit β-carotene monooxygenase, a homologue of RPE65 (31Goodman D.S. Huang H.S. Kanai M. Shiratori T. J. Biol. Chem. 1967; 242: 3543-3554Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar, 32Lindqvist A. Andersson S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 23942-23948Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). One possible explanation for the high IC50 is that iron ions may be tightly bound to the isomerohydrolase and β-carotene monooxygenases. Another possible explanation is that the isomerohydrolase activity assay used bovine RPE microsomes, because purified RPE65 loses its enzymatic activity possibly due to the detergent used in the purification process. The microsomes may contain other metal binding proteins and have high levels of endogenous metal ions. To identify the metal ion required by the isomerohydrolase, we have tested several divalent ions that are likely cofactors of enzymes, including Fe2+, Mg2+, Zn2+, and Cu2+. After the near complete inhibition of the isomerohydrolase activity by 1,10-phenanthroline, the metal ions were added separately into the isomerohydrolase assay system. Among these metal ions tested, only Fe2+ restored isomerohydrolase activity in a concentration-dependent manner, whereas Mg2+, Zn2+, and Cu2+ did not. Interestingly, our results showed that the iron oxidation state is important, because Fe2+ but not Fe3+ ion restored the isomerohydrolase activity, suggesting the isomerohydrolase specifically requires Fe2+ for its enzymatic activity. After deprivation of endogenous metal ions, the addition of Fe2+ enhanced isomerohydrolase activity in a Fe2+ concentration-dependent manner within the range of 0-6 mm. When Fe2+ concentration is higher than 6 mm, the isomerohydrolase activity decreases with the increasing concentrations of Fe2+ in the reaction mixture. This decrease of the isomerohydrolase activity may be ascribed to the free radical generation caused by oxidation of ferrous ion to ferric ion (Fenton reaction) (33Petrat F. Paluch S. Dogruoz E. Dorfler P. Kirsch M. Korth H.G. Sustmann R. de Groot H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 46403-46413Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) and/or concomitant protein modification by these radicals, in the presence of high and possibly toxic concentrations of iron. Recently, we demonstrated that recombinant RPE65 expressed in four different cell lines has the isomerohydrolase activity (5Moiseyev G. Chen Y. Takahashi Y. Wu B.X. Ma J.X. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 12413-12418Crossref PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar). In this study we showed that deprivation of iron also inhibits the isomerohydrolase activity of recombinant RPE65 expressed in 293A-LRAT cells. Moreover, the isomerohydrolase activity of recombinant RPE65 can be restored by the addition of FeSO4 into the reaction. These results further confirm that the isomerohydrolase activity of RPE65 is dependent on iron(II). It should be noted that in Fig. 4A the recombinant RPE65 appears to migrate faster in SDS-PAGE than the native enzyme from bovine RPE. We have shown that the molecular mass of native bovine RPE65 has molecular mass higher than theoretical value by ∼1000 Da probably due to post-translational modifications (27Ma J. Zhang J. Othersen K.L. Moiseyev G. Ablonczy Z. Redmond T.M. Chen Y. Crouch R.K. Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2001; 42: 1429-1435PubMed Google Scholar). It is not known if the recombinant RPE65 has similar modifications. The enzymatic activity of RPE65 requires the presence of LRAT (5Moiseyev G. Chen Y. Takahashi Y. Wu B.X. Ma J.X. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 12413-12418Crossref PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar) and CRALBP (34Winston A. Rando R.R. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 2044-2050Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), suggesting isomerohydrolase may function as an enzymatic complex. To further determine if the iron required for the activity is bound in RPE65 itself or in its functional partners, we have detected iron in purified RPE65 protein. The iron in RPE65 was demonstrated qualitatively by specific iron-staining methods in a native polyacrylamide gel. The same batch of the purified RPE65 protein showed apparent homogeneity on SDS-PAGE, indicating that the smear band of RPE65 in the native gel is not a result of impurity of RPE65. The quantitative ICP-MS measurements showed that stoichiometry of iron in purified bovine RPE65 equals to 0.8 ± 0.1. Because a fraction of RPE65 could lose bound iron during purification process, the ICP-MS results suggest that the real stoichiometry for iron bound in bovine RPE65 is 1. RPE65 shares significant sequence homology with β-carotene monooxygenase, an enzyme belonging to the non-heme iron-containing oxygenases (18von Lintig J. Vogt K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11915-11920Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar). The recombinant human β-carotene monooxygenase was shown to be sensitive to the metal chelating agents such as o-phenanthroline and 2,2′-bipyridine (32Lindqvist A. Andersson S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 23942-23948Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). This inhibition was similar to that of the native enzyme and corroborated an earlier assumption that iron is the metal ligand in the active site of the enzyme (31Goodman D.S. Huang H.S. Kanai M. Shiratori T. J. Biol. Chem. 1967; 242: 3543-3554Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). The crystal structures of a number of oxygen-activating mononuclear non-heme iron-containing enzymes have displayed a common structural motif in which two histidines and one carboxylate occupy a face of the iron coordination sphere, termed the 2-His-1-carboxylate facial triad (35Lange S.J. Que Jr., L. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 1998; 2: 159-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Recently, the x-ray structure of the carotenoid oxygenase, the first member of the β-carotene monooxygenase family, has been solved (36Kloer D.P. Ruch S. Al-Babili S. Beyer P. Schulz G.E. Science. 2005; 308: 267-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). It was shown that the endogenous Fe2+ is bound to the enzyme, being coordinated by four conserved histidines (36Kloer D.P. Ruch S. Al-Babili S. Beyer P. Schulz G.E. Science. 2005; 308: 267-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). Recently, it was also reported that the substitution of any one of iron-coordinated histidines in β-carotene monooxygenase caused a complete loss of the enzyme activity (20Poliakov E. Gentleman S. Cunningham Jr., F.X. Miller-Ihli N.J. Redmond T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; (on line publication.)PubMed Google Scholar). The crystal structure of RPE65 has not yet been determined. However, recent studies demonstrated that mutations at the conserved histidine and glutamate residues in RPE65 abolish its isomerohydrolase activity, suggesting that these conserved histidine and aspartate/glutamate residues may be located in the iron-binding site in RPE65 (21Takahashi Y. Moiseyev G. Chen Y. Ma J.X. FEBS Lett. 2005; 579: 5414-5418Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 22Redmond T.M. Poliakov E. Yu S. Tsai J.Y. Lu Z. Gentleman S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 13658-13663Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). It is likely that Fe2+ bound to RPE65 has a similar coordination to its conserved histidines. The interesting feature of the substrate in the complex of carotenoid oxygenase is the trans-cis isomerization at the methyl substituted double bond of isoprenoid tail upon the binding to the enzyme (36Kloer D.P. Ruch S. Al-Babili S. Beyer P. Schulz G.E. Science. 2005; 308: 267-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). Based on this observation, we hypothesize that similar mechanism for retinoid isomerization may be used by RPE65 to convert all-trans-retinyl ester to 11-cis-retinol. Although the exact function of the iron bound to RPE65 remains to be investigated, our data demonstrate that iron(II) likely serves as a cofactor for the isomerohydrolase. It is also possible that the endogenous iron is important for the structure and stability of RPE65 protein. In summary, our data provide the first biochemical evidence showing that RPE65 is an iron-containing protein and iron bound to RPE65 is required for its isomerohydrolase activity.

Therefore, the control of the intracellular free Ca2+ concentration [Ca2+]i 3The abbreviations used are: [Ca2+]i, intracellular concentration of free Ca2+; 3GA, Cibacron blue; ADPR, ADP ribose; cADPR, cyclic ADP ribose; ConA, concanavalin A; ECS, extracellular solution; I-V relation, current voltage relation; InsP3, d-myo-inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate; NADase, NAD glycohydrolase; RyR, ryanodine receptor(s); shRNA, short hairpin RNA; TRP, transient receptor potential; PP2, 4-amino-5-(4-chlorophenyl)-7-(t-butyl)pyrazolo(3,4-d)pyrimidine; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography; TRPM, transient receptor potential-melastatin-like. is of crucial importance for the regulation of many cellular functions, including proliferation, contraction, fertilization, motility, apoptosis, and cell death (1Berridge M.E. Bootmann M.D. Roderick H.L. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 19: 517-529Crossref Scopus (4256) Google Scholar). Receptor-mediated Ca2+ influx from the extracellular space is one important mechanism to control [Ca2+]i in non-excitable cells, e.g. leukocytes (2Guse A.H. Crit. Rev. Immunol. 1998; 18: 419-448Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although the molecular machinery underlying Ca2+ entry is still poorly defined, cation channels of the transient receptor potential (TRP) family that includes several subfamilies (3Montell C. Birnbaumer L. Flockerzi V. Bindels R.J. Bruford E.A. Caterina M.J. Clapham D.E. Harteneck C. Heller S. Julius D. Kojima I. Mori Y. Penner R. Prawitt D. Scharenberg A.M. Schultz G. Shimizu N. Zhu M.X.

TRPM2 (formerly LTRPC2 and TRPC7) is a member of the TRPM subfamily. TRPM2 forms non-selective Ca2+-permeable cation channels and is mainly expressed in brain and in cells of the immune system (6Perraud A.L. Fleig A. Dunn C.A. Bagley L.A. Launay P. Schmitz C.

Whether NAD also activates TRPM2 currents is still controversial (6Perraud A.L. Fleig A. Dunn C.A. Bagley L.A. Launay P. Schmitz C. Stokes A.J. Zhu Q. Bessman M.J. Penner R. Kinet J.P.

The nudix box in the cytosolic C-terminal region of TRPM2, a conserved motif of enzymes with nucleotide pyrophosphatase activity, seems to be responsible for gating of TRPM2 by ADPR and possibly by NAD (6Perraud A.L. Fleig A. Dunn C.A. Bagley L.A. Launay P. Schmitz C. Stokes A.J. Zhu Q. Bessman M.J. Penner R. Kinet J.P. Scharenberg A.M.

An involvement of TRPM2 in cellular signaling processes has been proposed since the expression of TRPM2 confers susceptibility to oxidant-induced cell death (11Hara Y. Wakamori M. Ishii M. Maeno E.

Cell. 2002; 9: 163-173Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (696) Google Scholar). A key question in the field relates to the potential role of the NAD metabolite ADPR as a second messenger. A function of NAD or ADPR as the missing link between specific extracellular signals and Ca2+ influx mediated by TRPM2 has been hypothesized (8Perraud A.L. Schmitz C. Scharrenberg A.M. Cell Calcium. 2003; 33: 519-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 13Fonfria E. Marshall I.C. Benham C.D. Boyfield I. Brown J.D. Hill K. Hughes J.P. Skaper S.D. McNulty S. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2004; 143: 186-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar, 14Ayub K. Hallett M.B. FASEB J. 2004; 18: 1335-1338Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), but experimental proofs are missing so far. To test this hypothesis directly, we developed a method to measure intracellular levels of ADPR in Jurkat T cells (15Gasser A. Guse A.H. J. Chromatogr. B Analyt. Technol. Biomed. Life Sci. 2005; 821: 181-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). We report that cytosolic ADPR concentrations are raised in response to concanavalin A (ConA) and induce Ca2+ entry through TRPM2, thereby significantly increasing [Ca2+]i. Inhibition of intracellular ADPR formation or gene silencing of TRPM2 efficiently diminished receptor-mediated Ca2+ influx carried by TRPM2. Moreover, blockade of ADPR formation also efficiently blocked ConA-induced cell death. Electrophysiology—Membrane currents were recorded in the whole-cell configuration of the patch clamp technique (16Hamill O.P. Marty A. Neher E. Sakmann B. Sigworth F.J. Pfluegers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 1981; 391: 85-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (15175) Google Scholar) or the perforated-patch configuration with nystatin (17Horn R. Marty A. J. Gen. Physiol. 1988; 92: 145-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (1462) Google Scholar). An EPC9 patch clamp amplifier was used in conjunction with the PULSE stimulation and data acquisition software (HEKA Elektronik, Lamprecht, Germany). The patch electrodes were made from 1.5-mm diameter borosilicate glass capillaries and filled with intracellular solution. Data were low pass-filtered at 1 kHz and compensated for both fast and slow capacity transients. Series resistance was compensated by 50–90%. All experiments were performed at room temperature with T cells slightly attached for the perforated patch mode, as described for the microinjection experiments, and firmly attached to high molecular weight poly-l-lysin for the whole-cell mode, respectively. For the whole-cell configuration, the pipette solution contained 145 mm potassium glutamate, 8 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, and 10 mm EGTA, adjusted to pH 7.2 with KOH and to a free Ca2+ of 100 nm with CaCl2. The external solution contained 145 mm NaCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, 2.8 mm KCl, 10 mm HEPES, 10 mm glucose, adjusted to pH 7.2 with NaOH. The cells were held at –60 mV, and current-voltage (I-V) relations were obtained using 250-ms voltage ramps from –100 to +100 mV. For the perforated-patch configuration, the pipette solution contained 140 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, 2.5 mm EGTA, 10 mm HEPES and had a calculated free [Ca2+]of 66 nm. The pH was adjusted to 7.3 with KOH. The external solution contained 140 mm NaCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 2 mm CaCl2, 5 mm KCl, 10 mm HEPES, and 10 mm glucose, buffered to pH 7.3 with NaOH. To block the Ca2+-activated K+ channels present in T cells, charybdotoxin (100 nm final concentration) was added; unspecific adsorption of charybdotoxin was prevented by bovine serum albumin (0.1% w/v). Nystatin was dissolved in Me2SO. Its final concentration in the standard pipette solution was 0.2 mg/ml. Ca2+ and Mn2+ Influx Measurements—Jurkat cells (2.4 × 107) were washed with extracellular solution (ECS) containing 140 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1.35 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 10 mm glucose, 15 mm HEPES, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, pH 7.4, loaded with 4 μm fura-2/AM (Calbiochem) in ECS for 30 min at 37 °C in the dark, washed again, and resuspended at 2 × 106 cells/ml in ECS. Before each measurement, aliquots of 4 × 106 cells were centrifuged and resuspended in 2 ml of nominally Ca2+-free ECS. In some experiments, cells were incubated for 20 min in ECS in the presence of 100 μm Cibacron blue 3GA (Sigma) and for 30 min in ECS in the presence of 200 nm nicotinamide 2′-deoxy-2′-fluoroarabinoside adenine dinucleotide (18Muller-Steffner H.M. Malver O. Hosie L. Oppenheimer N.J. Schuber F. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9606-9611Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). 1 μm 4-amino-5-(4-chlorophenyl)-7-(t-butyl)pyrazolo(3, 4-d)pyrimidine (PP2; Calbiochem) was added to the cuvette 5 min before the start of the measurement. [Ca2+]i was monitored in a Hitachi F-2000 spectrofluorometer (emission 510 nm, alternating excitations 340/380 nm) at room temperature with continuous stirring. Ca2+ entry upon ConA (100 μg/ml) or thapsigargin (100 nm) was measured 400 s after stimulation by the readdition of 1.35 mm Ca2+. In some experiments, different concentrations of GdCl3 were added 100 s before the readdition of Ca2+. Calibration of [Ca2+]i was done using 0.1% Triton X-100 to obtain the maximal ratio and using 8 mm EGTA, 60 mm Tris/HCl for the minimal ratio. Differences in [Ca2+]i were calculated using the values before the readdition of Ca2+ and 600 s thereafter. Quenching of fura-2 fluorescence (emission 510 nm, excitation 360 nm) in Jurkat cells after the addition of 25 μm Mn2+ was normalized to the fluorescence at the time point of stimulation (F/F300 s at 360 nm), and exponential decay functions were fitted to Mn2+ addition. Analysis of TRPM2 Expression by Reverse Transcriptase-PCR, Western Blotting, and Immunostaining—Total RNA was isolated from Jurkat cells using the RNeasy kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) with QiaShredder columns (Qiagen) and on-column DNase digest. One step reverse transcriptase-PCR was performed using the Titan kit (Roche Applied Science) with 200 ng of total RNA per reaction. Sequences of the primers were: 5′-TCA GGT GCC CCT CAG TGC TGT (exon 5SSF in SSF-TRPM2 (short striatal form of TRPM2), see Ref. 19Uemura T. Kudoh J. Noda S. Kanba S. Shimizu N. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

For Western blot analysis of TRPM2 expression, membrane proteins from Jurkat cells (100,000 × g centrifugation pellet; Ref. 20Guse A.H. da Silva C.P. Berg I. Skapenko A.L. Weber K. Heyer P. Hohenegger M. Ashamu G.A. Schulze-Koops H. Potter B.V. Mayr G.W. Nature. 1999; 398: 70-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar) were separated by a 7% SDS-PAGE (90 μg/lane) and transferred by tank blotting onto a nitrocellulose membrane (Hybond ECL; Amersham Biosciences). The membrane was blocked with 5% dry milk protein in Tris-buffered saline. The primary antibody against TRPM2 (Abcam, Cambridge, UK, catalog number AB11167) was used at a concentration of 2 μg/ml for 2 h, and the secondary antibody was a goat anti-rabbit horse-radish peroxidase conjugate (Dianova, Hamburg, Germany) at 0.12 μg/ml for 1 h. The blocking peptide was incubated with the anti-TRPM2 monoclonal antibody at 5-fold excess at 4 °C overnight prior to addition to the blot membrane. Detection was done with Hyperfilm ECL and the ECL kit (Amersham Biosciences), according to the instructions of the manufacturer. For immunostaining of TRPM2, Jurkat cells were fixed and permeabilized with p-formaldehyde and methanol as described (21Kunerth S. Mayr G.W. Koch-Nolte F. Guse A.H. Cell. Signal. 2003; 15: 783-792Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The primary antibody against TRPM2 was used at 20 μg/ml for 1 h, and a fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibody (Abcam, catalog number AB7086) at 10 μg/ml (1 h of incubation) was used for detection. An Improvision imaging system (Improvision, Tübingen, Germany) was used at 100-fold magnification (Leica objective type HCX APO ×100/1.3 OIL U-V-I; numerical aperture 1.3), built around a fluorescence microscope (Leica DM IRE2). Images were taken at room temperature with a grayscale CCD camera (type C4742-95-12ER; Hamamatsu). Using a single stained cell, 125 images were recorded from bottom to top with a distance of 0.2 μm between each layer. Determination of Endogenous ADPR—Jurkat T cells were cultured as described (20Guse A.H. da Silva C.P. Berg I. Skapenko A.L. Weber K. Heyer P. Hohenegger M. Ashamu G.A. Schulze-Koops H. Potter B.V. Mayr G.W. Nature. 1999; 398: 70-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). 5 × 107 cells were incubated in extracellular buffer (22da Silva C.P. Potter B.V.L. Mayr G.W. Guse A.H. J. Chromatogr. B. 1998; 707: 43-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) for 30 min at 25 °C and stimulated for different periods of time with 100 μg/ml ConA Type IV (Sigma). In some experiments, the cells were incubated in the presence of 100 μm Cibacron blue 3GA (Sigma) in extracellular buffer for 20 min before ConA stimulation. Cellular amounts of ADPR were determined as described (15Gasser A. Guse A.H. J. Chromatogr. B Analyt. Technol. Biomed. Life Sci. 2005; 821: 181-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were lysed in trichloroacetic acid, and cell debris was removed. The samples were divided into identical halves, to one of which genuine ADPR (2.5 nmol) was added for determination of the recovery. Protein precipitates were removed, and the supernatants were neutralized by extraction with diethyl ether. The samples were then purified by solid phase extraction and analyzed by reversed-phase HPLC using a Multohyp BDS C18 column (250 × 4.6 mm, particle size 5 μm; Chromatographie Service, Langerwehe, Germany) as described (15Gasser A. Guse A.H. J. Chromatogr. B Analyt. Technol. Biomed. Life Sci. 2005; 821: 181-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The recoveries were calculated for each twin sample, and the amounts of ADPR were corrected for the respective recovery of each sample. Microinjection and Single Cell Ca2+ Imaging—Ratiometric Ca2+ imaging was performed as described (21Kunerth S. Mayr G.W. Koch-Nolte F. Guse A.H. Cell. Signal. 2003; 15: 783-792Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Briefly, glass coverslips coated with bovine serum albumin and poly-l-lysine (0.1 mg/ml) were mounted on the stage of the Leica microscope (Leica DM IRE2). An Improvision imaging system as described above for immunocytochemistry was used. Illumination at 340 and 380 nm was performed using a monochromator system (polychromator IV; TILL Photonics). Images were acquired using Openlab software (v3.09; Improvision). Raw data images were stored on hard disk, and ratio images (340/380 nm) were constructed pixel-by-pixel. Microinjection of ADPR into fura-2 loaded, slightly adhering Jurkat cells was performed as reported (23Guse A.H. Berg I. da Silva C.P. Potter B.V. Mayr G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8546-8550Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 24Kunerth S. Langhorst M.F. Schwarzmann N. Gu X. Huang L. Yang Z. Zhang L. Mills S.J. Zhang L.H.

Signal. 2004; 16: 1283-1289Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). An Eppendorf microinjection system (transjector type 5246, micromanipulator type 5171) equipped with Femtotips II as pipettes was used. The system was operated in the semiautomatic mode with the following instrumental settings: injection pressure, 60 hectopascals; compensatory pressure, 30 hectopascals; injection time, 0.3–0.5 s; and velocity of the pipette, 700 μm/s. ADPR and ryanodine were dissolved in intracellular buffer (110 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 5 mm KH2PO4, 10 mm NaCl, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.2) and filtered (0.2 μm) before use. The injection volume was ∼1–1.5% of the cell volume, resulting in a 50–100-fold dilution of the pipette solution after microinjection (23Guse A.H. Berg I. da Silva C.P. Potter B.V. Mayr G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8546-8550Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Gene Silencing of TRPM2—Inserts coding for short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) under control of the human U6 snRNA promoter were cloned into the vector pDsRed2-C1 (Clontech). One shRNA was targeted against the sequence 5′-CAG GCG CAT CCC ACT CTA T-3′ (positions 4450–4468 in TRPM2 cDNA, GenBank™ accession number NM_003307), the other was targeted against the sequence 5′-CAT CTG CAG GAA GAG CAT AAA-3′ (positions 4099–4119), and both contained the loop sequence 5′-TTC AAG AGA-3′. The vector pDsRed2-C1 without insert was used as control. Transfection was carried out using a Bio-Rad Genepulser (4-mm cuvettes, 2 × 107 cells in 400 μl, 200 V, 960 microfarads, 40 μg of plasmid DNA). Intact cells were purified from debris using a Ficoll gradient. Cells were analyzed for fluorescence 24, 48, and 72 h after transfection. Only cells showing a distinct DsRed2 fluorescence were selected for current recordings. Cell Death Assay—Jurkat cells were washed with RMPI 1640 and incubated at 106 cells/ml, either without or with different concentrations of 3GA (30–300 μm) for 30 min at 37 °C. Then, ConA (final concentration, 100 μg/ml) or a vehicle control was added. After a further 15-min incubation, 7.5% newborn calf serum was added. In some experiments, 1 mm EGTA was present in all solutions. The cells were incubated for 165 min at 37 °C and thoroughly resuspended, and cell numbers were determined using an automated cell counter (Casy 1 TT, Schärfe System, Reutlingen, Germany). Stimulation of intact Jurkat T cells by a high ConA concentration (100 μg/ml) resulted in a slowly developing, large inward current (Fig. 1A) characterized by an almost linear I-V relationship (Fig. 1B), as determined in the perforated-patch mode in the presence of charybdotoxin to block Ca2+-activated K+ channels (26Ghanshani S. Wulff H. Miller M.J. Rohm H. Neben A. Gutman G.A. Cahalan M.D. Chandy K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 37137-37149Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar). The classical inward current triggered by T cell activation via low concentrations of mitogenic lectins (<10 μg/ml) is ICRAC, which is characterized by high selectivity for Ca2+, very low unitary conductance, inward rectification, remarkable sensitivity toward Gd3+, and activation by store depletion, e.g. by thapsigargin (27Lewis R.S. Cahalan M.D. Cell Regul. 1989; 1: 99-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar, 28Zweifach A. Lewis R.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6295-6299Crossref PubMed Scopus (697) Google Scholar, 29Hoth M. Pfluegers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 1995; 430: 315-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Thus, the current observed here upon the addition of a high ConA concentration (100 μg/ml) is different from ICRAC in terms of conductance and I-V relationship. To further distinguish Ca2+ signals based on the novel current or ICRAC, the sensitivity of the sustained Ca2+ entry phase toward Gd3+ was analyzed upon activation by either thapsigargin or ConA. Thapsigargin-mediated Ca2+ entry was effectively inhibited by Gd3+ (Fig. 1C) with an IC50 of ∼0.1 μm and full inhibition at 1 μm (Fig. 1D) as described (30Ross P.E. Cahalan M.D. J. Gen. Physiol. 1995; 106: 415-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). In contrast, ConA-mediated sustained Ca2+ entry was unaffected at 0.1 μm Gd3+ (Fig. 1D), and the IC50 was about 1 order of magnitude higher as compared with activation by thapsigargin (Fig. 1D). The characteristics of the novel current, especially the linear I-V relationship, the high current amplitudes, and the reduced sensitivity to Gd3+, indicated that it may be carried by the cation channel TRPM2. Indeed, expression of TRPM2 in cells of the immune system has been published (7Sano Y. Inamura K. Miyake A. Mochizuki S. Yokoi H. Matsushime H. Furuichi K. Science. 2001; 293: 1327-1330Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). To confirm these published data, the expression and functional properties of TRPM2 were investigated in Jurkat T cells. Reverse transcriptase-PCR analysis confirmed the expression of TRPM2 in Jurkat T cells (data not shown). The use of different primer pairs revealed the expression of differentially spliced mRNAs: (i) an amplicon indicative of a TRPM2 isoform (termed SSF, see Ref. 19Uemura T. Kudoh J. Noda S. Kanba S. Shimizu N. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2005; 328: 1232-1243Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) significantly truncated in the N terminus; (ii) two amplicons indicative of the full-length mRNA; and (iii) an amplicon indicative of a TRPM2 isoform slightly truncated in the C terminus by deletion of exon 27 (see Ref. 10Wehage E. Eisfeld J. Heiner I. Jüngling E. Zitt C. Lückhoff A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 23150-23156Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). Western blot analysis resulted in a major band at ∼138 kDa and a faint band at 161 kDa (Fig. 1E). Comparison of the theoretically expected sizes deduced from the above mentioned mRNAs indicates that the 138-kDa protein represents the N-terminally truncated version (SSF), whereas the 161-kDa protein is full-length TRPM2. The specificity of the commercially available monoclonal antibody used was confirmed by blockade of specific staining of the 161- and 138-kDa bands by excess of the antigenic peptide used for monoclonal antibody preparation (Fig. 1E). Confocal immunostaining revealed localization of TRPM2 mainly on the cell surface; in the absence of primary antibody, only modest background staining was observed (Fig. 1F). The functional properties of TRPM2 in Jurkat T cells were analyzed by whole-cell mode patch clamp experiments. Upon intracellular application of ADPR, a slowly developing inward cation current was recorded at a membrane potential of –80 mV (Fig. 1G), whereas infusion of intracellular buffer did not induce any currents (Fig. 1G). The I-V relation of the current activated by ADPR was linear (Fig. 1H) and comparable with the current seen upon ConA stimulation in the perforated patch mode (Fig. 1, A and B). These data indicate that the large inward current observed upon ConA stimulation may be carried by the non-selective, non-rectifying cation channel TRPM2. Since TRPM2 is activated by ADPR (Fig. 1, G and H), an HPLC method for the quantification of cellular amounts of ADPR was developed (15Gasser A. Guse A.H. J. Chromatogr. B Analyt. Technol. Biomed. Life Sci. 2005; 821: 181-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Cellular ADPR levels were analyzed in Jurkat T cells either not stimulated or activated by ConA (Fig. 2A, upper versus lower panel). Under stimulation conditions, an increase in cellular ADPR concentrations was found consistently (Fig. 2A, lower panel). Time course analysis upon stimulation of Jurkat T cells with ConA revealed a statistically significant ∼1.5-fold increase (Fig. 2B). A plateau phase was reached after 1 min of stimulation and remained elevated for at least 15 min (Fig. 2B). The increase of [Ca2+]i upon ConA stimulation of these cells (Fig. 2B, solid line) tightly followed the rise of cellular ADPR levels (Fig. 2B, dashed line), indicating a causal relation between these two signaling events. Although ConA induced a significant Ca2+ entry (Fig. 1C), it was not clear whether TRPM2, as an unspecific cation channel supposed to mainly carry Na+ ions under physiological conditions, may contribute sufficiently to the ConA-induced Ca2+ signal. The currents shown in Fig. 1, A and G, likely mainly reflect the entry of Na+ through TRPM2 since upon replacement of extracellular Na+ by the non-permeant cation N-methyl-d-glucamine, hardly any currents were resolved (10Wehage E.

To investigate directly whether ADPR-induced openings of TRPM2 are sufficient to elevate [Ca2+]i by the entry of extracellular Ca2+, single cell Ca2+ imaging experiments were carried out using intact Jurkat T cells (20Guse A.H. da Silva C.P.

Upon microinjection of ADPR, a concentration-dependent increase of [Ca2+]i was observed, whereas injection of intracellular buffer did not induce Ca2+ signals (Fig. 3). The average tracings (Fig. 3, right panels) demonstrate that the velocity of the increase in [Ca2+]i, rather than the amplitude of the [Ca2+]i plateau, correlated with the ADPR concentration present in the pipette. It is important to note here that the actual intracellular concentrations of injected compounds are roughly 100-fold less as compared with the pipette concentration (which is given in Fig. 3); this is due to the fact that the injection volume is ∼1% of the cell volume (23Guse A.H. Berg I. da Silva C.P. Potter B.V. Mayr G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8546-8550Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Co-injection of ryanodine at a high concentration, known to block Ca2+ release from ryanodine receptor (RyR), did not significantly reduce the effect of ADPR (Fig. 3). Microinjection of ADPR in the absence of extracellular Ca2+ was almost without effect, confirming that Ca2+ entry is the major, if not the only, mechanism operated by intracellular ADPR (Fig. 3, lower panels). To further investigate the causal relationship between stimulation of cells, ADPR formation, and TRPM2 activation, two independent approaches were performed. First, expression of TRPM2 was suppressed by gene silencing using RNA interference. Jurkat T cells were transiently transfected with plasmids expressing two different shRNAs specifically targeted to TRPM2 mRNA. The usefulness of the selected shRNAs was initially analyzed by patch clamp recordings in the whole-cell mode. Fig. 4B demonstrates that 24 and 72 h after transfection, current densities observed upon intracellular infusion of ADPR were largely suppressed (Fig. 4, B and C), whereas in control cells, the ADPR-induced current was fully developed (Fig. 4, A and C). Similar results were obtained with a second shRNA construct (data not shown). Then, recordings in the perforated patch mode were conducted upon cell stimulation by ConA. Although ConA induced the typical slowly developing, large inward current in control cells, largely reduc"

Contributing to this uncertainty, the TP63 locus can express multiple gene products from two different promoters. Utilization of the upstream promoter results in expression of the TAp63 variant with an activation domain similar to p53. In contrast, the NH2-terminally deleted (ΔN) p63 variant, transcribed from a cryptic promoter in intron 3, lacks such an activation domain. Thus, the TAp63 and ΔNp63 variants possess a wide ranging ability to up-regulate p53 target genes. Consequentially, the disparity in transactivation potential between p63 variants has given rise to the hypothesis that the ΔNp63 variant can serve as oncoprotein by opposing the activity of the TAp63 variant and p53. However, recent studies have revealed a transcriptional activity for ΔNp63. This study was undertaken to address the transcriptional activity of the ΔNp63 variant. Here, we showed that all NH2-terminally deleted p63 isoforms retain a potential in transactivation and growth suppression. Interestingly, ΔNp63β possesses a remarkable ability to suppress cell proliferation and transactivate target genes, which is consistently higher than that seen with ΔNp63α. In contrast, ΔNp63γ has a weak or undetectable activity dependent upon the cell lines used. We also demonstrate that an intact DNA-binding domain is required for ΔNp63 function. In addition, we found that the novel activation domain for the ΔNp63 variant is composed of the 14 unique ΔN residues along with the adjacent region, including a PXXP motif. Finally, we demonstrated that a PPXY motif shared by ΔNp63α and ΔNp63β is required for optimal transactivation of target gene promoters, suggesting that the PPXY motif is requisite for ΔNp63 function. p63, a member of the p53 family of transcription factors, is known to be involved in epithelial development.

In response to DNA damage, oncogene activation, or other forms of cellular stress, p53 is stabilized by a complex series of post-translational modifications and protein-protein interactions that allow p53 to carry out its tumor suppression activity. Structurally, p53 is organized into several domains, each of which contributes to p53 transcriptional activity. p53 contains two amino-terminal activation domains, AD1 within residues 1–42 and AD2 within residues 43–92, including the proline-rich domain, which enable p53 to form direct associations with transcriptional coactivators. The DNA-binding domain allows for sequence-specific recognition of response elements in p53 target gene promoters. The tetramerization domain directs formation of the p53 tetramer required for DNA binding. Finally, the carboxyl-terminal basic domain has a regulatory function by controlling p53 stability and transcriptional activity (reviewed in Ref. 1Liu G. Xia T. Chen X. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 17557-17565Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). p63, a member of the p53 family of transcription factors, was identified in 1998 (2Osada M. Ohba M.

Like p53, p63 contains a proline-rich domain, a DNA-binding domain, and a tetramerization domain, all of which share strong sequence similarity with p53 (reviewed in Ref. 4Yang A. Kaghad M. Caput D. McKeon F. Trends Genet. 2002; 18: 90-95Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar). Accordingly, p63 is able to regulate many p53 target genes. However, due to two transcriptional start sites, the TP63 locus is capable of expressing two major variants, called TA 2The abbreviations used are: TA, transcriptional activation; ADULT, acro-dermato-ungual-lacrimal-tooth; EEC, ectrodactyly-ectodermal dysplasia-cleft lip/palate; ΔN, NH2-terminally deleted; AD, activation domain; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline. and ΔN, both of which have multiple isoforms as a result of alternative splicing at the COOH terminus. Transcribed from the upstream promoter, the TA variant contains an acidic, transcriptional activation domain (AD) similar to p53 and is able to transactivate p53 target genes as well as inhibit cell proliferation and induce apoptosis. In contrast, the ΔNp63 variant, transcribed from the cryptic promoter in intron 3, lacks the activation domain encoded by exons 2 and 3 but gains 14 unique residues in its NH2 terminus. Alternative splicing of p63 transcripts results in expression of at least three COOH-terminal isoforms, α, β, and γ. Thus, the TP63 gene is capable of producing at least six transcripts: p63α, p63β, p63γ, ΔNp63α, ΔNp63β, and ΔNp63γ (Fig. 1A). The discovery of p53 family members, p73 in 1997 (5Kaghad M. Bonnet H.

Although enthusiasm was initially tempered by findings that p63 and p73 do not function as classic tumor suppressors, recent evidence suggests that p63 might serve an important role in tumor suppression. Amplification and overexpression of p63 has been linked to increased survival rates in lung cancer patients (6Massion P.P. Taflan P.M. Jamshedur Rahman S.M. Yildiz P. Shyr Y. Edgerton M.E. Westfall M.D. Roberts J.R. Pietenpol J.A. Carbone D.P. Gonzalez A.L.

Breast Cancer. 2002; 9: 216-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Likewise, fibroblasts derived from p63 knock-out mice were shown to be defective in the p53-mediated apoptotic response (11Flores E.R. Tsai K.Y. Crowley D. Sengupta S. Yang A. McKeon F. Jacks T. Nature. 2002; 416: 560-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (725) Google Scholar). In addition, a follow up study has demonstrated that mice heterozygous for p63 developed an increased tumor burden and metastasis rate, which was compounded in mice harboring heterozygous alleles of p53 and/or p73 (12Flores E.R. Sengupta S. Miller J.B. Newman J.J. Bronson R. Crowley D. Yang A. McKeon F. Jacks T. Cancer Cell. 2005; 7: 363-373Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar). Among all p63 isoforms, ΔNp63α is the most predominantly expressed. Our laboratory and others have demonstrated that ΔNp63α retains transcriptional activity and is competent to induce growth suppression (13Dohn M. Zhang S. Chen X. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 3193-3205Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). When expressed in H1299 cells, ΔNp63α is able to inhibit cell proliferation, induce cell death, and up-regulate GADD45 (growth arrest and DNA damage-45) and p21. Importantly, these activities are dependent on the presence of the NH2 terminus, since the ΔΔNp63α construct lacking the first 26 amino acids was nonfunctional. These findings have forced the scientific community to reconsider the role of ΔNp63α in tumor formation and development. Evidence supporting a transcriptional activity for ΔNp63α has been demonstrated by others. For example, ΔNp63α was shown to function both as a positive regulator of p53-responsive promoters and as a negative regulator of maturation-specific genes during Ca2+-induced keratinocyte differentiation (14King K.E. Ponnamperuma R.M. Yamashita T. Tokino T. Lee L.A. Young M.F. Weinberg W.C. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 3635-3644Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Similarly, small interfering RNA knockdown of ΔNp63α in immortalized mammary epithelial cells revealed that ΔNp63α promotes transcription of PUMA and NOXA but negatively regulates the P21 and P53 promoters (15Harmes D.C. Bresnick E. Lubin E.A. Watson J.K. Heim K.E. Curtin J.C. Suskind A.M. Lamb J. DiRenzo J. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 7607-7616Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Finally, ΔNp63α activates the HSP70 promoter, as well as induces hsp70 protein expression (16Wu G. Osada M. Guo Z. Fomenkov A. Begum S. Zhao M. Upadhyay S. Xing M. Wu F. Moon C. Westra W.H. Koch W.M. Mantovani R. Califano J.A. Ratovitski E. Sidransky D. Trink B. Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 758-766PubMed Google Scholar). Whereas a tumor suppressor function has recently been ascribed to p63, previous studies have suggested that p63 might function as an oncogene. For example, ΔNp63α was characterized as transcriptionally incompetent and shown to be a dominant negative to TAp63 and p53 in luciferase reporter assays (3Yang A. Kaghad M. Wang Y. Gillett E. Fleming M.D. Dotsch V. Andrews N.C. Caput D. McKeon F. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 305-316Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1846) Google Scholar, 17Shimada A. Kato S. Enjo K. Osada M. Ikawa Y. Kohno K. Obinata M. Kanamaru R. Ikawa S. Ishioka C. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 2781-2786PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, loricrin promoter-driven expression of ΔNp63α in the epidermis of transgenic mice hindered apoptosis induced by UV-B but did not alter epithelial cell proliferation or stratification (18Liefer K.M. Koster M.I. Wang X.J. Yang A. McKeon F. Roop D.R. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 4016-4020PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, chromosomal arm 3q, which contains the TP63 locus, is amplified, and the ΔNp63α transcript is overexpressed in lung cancer and squamous cell carcinomas of the head and neck (19Hibi K. Trink B. Patturajan M. Westra W.H. Caballero O.L. Hill D.E. Ratovitski E.A. Jen J. Sidransky D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 5462-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar). Likewise, TAp63 isoforms are overexpressed in certain lymphomas (20Di Como C.J. Urist M.J. Babayan I. Drobnjak M. Hedvat C.V. Teruya-Feldstein J. Pohar K. Hoos A. Cordon-Cardo C. Clin. Cancer Res. 2002; 8: 494-501PubMed Google Scholar). Debate on the function of ΔNp63α will continue until regulation of p63-mediated target gene expression is elucidated. To gain a better understanding of the diverse activities found in the p63 isoforms, we mutated or deleted specific regions in p63. By comparing the transcriptional activity of wild-type and mutant p63 proteins in stable, inducible cell lines and in transient expression studies, we have characterized several functional domains that regulate ΔNp63 transactivation potential. Our results demonstrated that ΔNp63α and ΔNp63β are capable of inducing target gene expression and inhibiting cell proliferation. We showed that these activities are dependent upon DNA binding, since DNA-binding domain mutants were inactive. In addition, we have defined the activation domain in ΔNp63, which includes the 14 unique ΔN residues and the adjacent proline-rich domain. Finally, our results demonstrate that a PPXY motif, present in ΔNp63α and ΔNp63β, modulates ΔNp63 function.

SDS-PAGE and Western blots were carried out as previously described (27Zhu J. Jiang J. Zhou W. Chen X. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 5061-5065PubMed Google Scholar). Nitrocellulose membranes were blocked with 5% dry milk in PBS with 0.1% Tween 20 (PBST) for 30 min, incubated in primary antibody overnight at 4 °C or for 2 h at room temperature, and washed three times for 10 min in PBST, and then the membrane was incubated in horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody for 1 h at room temperature and washed four times in PBST. Blots were developed using Pierce Pico-West reagents, followed by exposure to x-ray film. All antibody dilutions were carried out with 2% dry milk in PBST. Northern Blot Analysis—Cells were plated at a density of 2.5 × 106 cells/10-cm dish and incubated for 24 h. Following induction, plates were washed with cold PBS (pH 7.4) and collected in 1.0 ml of Trizol reagent (Invitrogen). Total RNA was isolated following the manufacturer's instructions. Northern blots were prepared using 10 μg of total RNA. The P21, DKK1 (DICKKOPF-1), PIG3 (p53-induced gene-3), GADD45, FDXR, and GAPDH probes were prepared as previously described (27Zhu J. Jiang J. Zhou W. Chen X. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 5061-5065PubMed Google Scholar, 28Chen X. Liu G. Zhu J. Jiang J. Nozell S. Willis A. Cancer Biol. Ther. 2003; 2: 55-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Blots were exposed to x-ray film and quantified by densitometry. Luciferase Assays—Transient transfections were carried out using the calcium phosphate precipitation method (25Chen C. Okayama H. Mol. Cell Biol. 1987; 7: 2745-2752Crossref PubMed Scopus (4821) Google Scholar). Briefly, p53-null H1299 cells were plated at 5 × 104 cells/well in 12-well plates and allowed to recover overnight. Using the calcium phosphate method, cells were co-transfected with 100 ng of wild-type or mutant p63 construct in pcDNA3 and 100 ng of pGL2 reporter vector/well. As an internal control, 5 ng of pRL-CMV, a Renilla luciferase vector (Promega), was also co-transfected per well. 36 h post-transfection, cells were washed with cold PBS and lysed in 150 μl of passive lysis buffer. Luciferase activity was measured using the Promega dual luciferase kit and a Turner Designs luminometer. The -fold increase in relative luciferase activity was the product of the luciferase activity induced by pcDNA3 constructs expressing wild-type or mutant p63 divided by that induced by a pcDNA3 empty control vector. All ΔNp63 Isoforms Have the Potential to Inhibit Cell Proliferation—To determine the role of ΔNp63 isoforms in cell cycle progression and cell death, stable cell lines were created using the tetracycline-off system. H1299, a p53-null lung cancer cell line, was utilized to determine the p53-independent function of ΔNp63 isoforms. Previously published data from our laboratory demonstrate that tetracycline does not alter H1299 cell proliferation (29Zhu J. Jiang J. Zhou W. Zhu K. Chen X. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 2149-2155Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Multiple cell lines were generated, and two representative cell lines for each ΔNp63 isoform were selected for further study. As shown in Fig. 1B, these cell lines were able to inducibly express ΔNp63α, ΔNp63β, or ΔNp63γ. In addition, the protein level of each isoform was comparable (Fig. 1B). To determine the transcriptional activity of each isoform, we monitored the level of p21WAF1, a known p53 target gene. Similar to our previous finding (13Dohn M. Zhang S. Chen X. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 3193-3205Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar), ΔNp63α was able to induce a modest increase in p21 expression. Whereas p21 expression was weakly induced by ΔNp63γ, ΔNp63β was highly active in inducing this p53 target gene. To determine the ability of ΔNp63 isoforms to inhibit cell proliferation, growth rate analysis was performed (Fig. 1C). Consistent with our previous report, ΔNp63α reduced the proliferation potential of H1299 cells by day 3 (13Dohn M. Zhang S. Chen X. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 3193-3205Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). Furthermore, we showed that ΔNp63β and ΔNp63γ were capable of inhibiting cell proliferation, with ΔNp63β displaying the greatest ability to induce growth suppression, followed by ΔNp63α and then ΔNp63γ (Fig. 1C). To characterize the decreased proliferative potential of H1299 cells seen in our growth curve assay, trypan blue dye exclusion studies were performed as an indicator of cell viability (Fig. 1D). Following induction of ΔNp63β, we observed a significant increase in the number of trypan blue-positive, nonviable cells over that seen for uninduced controls. Likewise, we observed a moderate increase in nonviable cells upon induction of ΔNp63α. In contrast, there was no difference in the viability of control cells and those induced to express ΔNp63γ. In addition, DNA histogram analysis was performed to determine the cell cycle profile of these cells in the presence or absence of each ΔNp63 isoform (Fig. 1E). We found that sub-G1 accumulation, associated with apoptotic cell death, was increased upon induction of ΔNp63α and ΔNp63β. We also found that ΔNp63α and ΔNp63β induced cell cycle arrest, primarily in G1 phase. Upon induction of ΔNp63γ, cell cycle arrest in G1 phase, but not significant apoptosis, was detected in both ΔNp63γ-expressing cell lines. Taken together, these results demonstrate that ΔNp63α and ΔNp63β can induce cell death. To rule out the possibility that these ΔNp63 activities are cell type-specific, we used MCF-7 breast adenocarcinoma cells to produce additional stable cell lines. Unpublished results from our laboratory have demonstrated that tetracycline does not alter MCF-7 cell proliferation. Multiple cell lines inducibly expressing ΔNp63α, ΔNp63β, or ΔNp63γ were generated, and two representative clones were chosen for further studies. Western blot analysis was performed to determine the level of protein expressed (Fig. 2A). We found that these ΔNp63 isoforms were expressed at a comparable level and that p21 was up-regulated by ΔNp63β but not by ΔNp63α and ΔNp63γ. Similar to our results observed in H1299 cells, growth curve analysis demonstrated that ΔNp63α and ΔNp63β inhibited cell proliferation, whereas ΔNp63γ was almost inert (Fig. 2B). It is noteworthy that p21 induction was low in ΔNp63α, suggesting that a target gene other than p21 was responsible for mediating ΔNp63α-dependent growth suppression. To further demonstrate the transcriptional activity of p63 isoforms, Northern blot analysis was performed on MCF-7 cell lines induced to express TAp63α, ΔNp63α, TAp63γ, and ΔNp63γ for 1 and 7 days (Fig. 3). As expected, TAp63γ possessed the greatest potential to up-regulate PIG3, a proapoptotic gene, and P21, a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor, whereas TAp63α had reduced transactivation potential due to its inhibitory COOH terminus. In addition, ΔNp63α was able to induce expression of GADD45 in MCF-7 cells similar to our previously published results seen in H1299 cells (13Dohn M. Zhang S. Chen X. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 3193-3205Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). Interestingly, ΔNp63γ was able to induce DKK1, an inhibitor of Wnt signaling. These data effectively demonstrate the differential transcriptional activity of the p63 isoforms and highlight the need for additional studies involving isoform-specific gene activation. DNA Binding Is Essential for p63 Function—Most hotspot mutations found in TP53 are located in the DNA-binding domain. These mutations, characterized as either contact site or conformational mutants, are often associated with loss of tumor suppressor function. Similar mutations, associated with EEC syndrome (reviewed in Ref. 30Brunner H.G. Hamel B.C. Van Bokhoven H. J. Med. Genet. 2002; 39: 377-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (149)"
https://openalex.org/W1994941602,"β-Arrestins have been shown to inhibit competitively G proteindependent signaling and to mediate endocytosis for many of the hundreds of nonvisual rhodopsin family G protein-coupled receptors (GPCR). An open question of fundamental importance concerning the regulation of signal transduction of several hundred rhodopsin-like GPCRs is how these receptors of limited sequence homology, when considered in toto, can all recruit and activate the two highly conserved β-arrestin proteins as part of their signaling/desensitization process. Although the serine and threonine residues that form GPCR kinase phosphorylation sites are common β-arrestin-associated receptor determinants regulating receptor desensitization and internalization, the agonist-activated conformation of a GPCR probably reveals the most fundamental determinant mediating the GPCR and arrestin interaction. Here we identified a β-arrestin binding determinant common to the rhodopsin family GPCRs formed from the proximal 10 residues of the second intracellular loop. We demonstrated by both gain and loss of function studies for the serotonin 2C, β2-adrenergic, α2a-adrenergic, and neuropeptide Y type 2 receptorsthat the highly conserved amino acids, proline and alanine, naturally occurring in rhodopsin family receptors six residues distal to the highly conserved second loop DRY motif regulate β-arrestin binding and β-arrestin-mediated internalization. In particular, as demonstrated for the β2 AR, this occurs independently of changes in GPCR kinase phosphorylation. These results suggest that a GPCR conformation directed by the second intracellular loop, likely using the loop itself as a binding patch, may function as a switch for transitioning β-arrestin from its inactive form to its active receptor-binding state. β-Arrestins have been shown to inhibit competitively G proteindependent signaling and to mediate endocytosis for many of the hundreds of nonvisual rhodopsin family G protein-coupled receptors (GPCR).

In the eye the light-induced signaling mediated through the G protein transducin is competitively blocked by the binding of visual arrestin to rhodopsin. An analogous paradigm is repeated outside the visual system to terminate G protein-mediated signaling for rhodopsin family GPCRs 5The abbreviations used are: GPCR, G protein-coupled receptor; 5HT, 5-hydroxytryptamine;α2aAR,α2a-adrenergic receptor;β2AR,β2-adrenergic receptor; GFP, green fluorescent protein; GRK, G protein-coupled receptor kinase; NPY, neuropeptide Y; GTPγS, guanosine 5′-3-O-(thio) triphosphate; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. 5The abbreviations used are: GPCR, G protein-coupled receptor; 5HT, 5-hydroxytryptamine;α2aAR,α2a-adrenergic receptor;β2AR,β2-adrenergic receptor; GFP, green fluorescent protein; GRK, G protein-coupled receptor kinase; NPY, neuropeptide Y; GTPγS, guanosine 5′-3-O-(thio) triphosphate; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. except visual arrestin is replaced by β-arrestins. Variations inβ-arrestin affinity for individual receptors and between different GPCRs primarily rest on the following two factors: the agonist-induced conformation of the receptor, and the ability of G protein-coupled receptor kinases (GRK) to phosphorylate serine and threonine residues on the C-tail and third intracellular loop of a receptor (1Krupnick J.G.

Parkes J.H. Liebman P.A. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 5738-5749Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 7Kuhn H. Hall S.W. Wilden U.

More recently, the formation of stable β-arrestin complexes with agonist-activated GPCRs has been shown to require phosphorylation of serine and threonine clusters located in the C-terminal tails of the receptor (3Oakley R.H. Laporte S.A. Holt J.A. Barak L.S. Caron M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 19452-19460Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar). It has been proposed that in addition to phosphorylation, high affinity arrestin/receptor binding also requires receptor determinants that are exposed only in the active receptor conformation (9Gurevich V.V. Benovic J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11628-11638Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Gurevich V.V. Gurevich E.V. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2004; 25: 105-111Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). Supporting this alternative are observations that agonist-activated GPCRs bind β-arrestins even in the absence of GRK phosphorylation (2Gurevich V.V. Pals-Rylaarsdam R. Benovic J.L. Hosey M.M. Onorato J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28849-28852Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). This phosphorylation-independent binding suggests that determinants, resulting from conserved primary amino acid sequences or protein secondary structural motifs, exist in all GPCRs to regulate receptor/arrestin association. However, the receptor regions that would comprise these arrestin-binding motifs have not been thoroughly defined, perhaps as a result of the sequence variability occurring throughout the entire GPCR family and the absence of crystal structure data other than for rhodopsin.GPCRs are structurally similar in their seven transmembrane architecture and share behaviors that originate from commonly occurring stretches of amino acids. The (E/D) RY motif, one of the most conserved of these sequences in the large family of rhodopsin-like GPCRs, is found at the cytoplasmic/intracellular loop junction of transmembrane III. The DRY motif presumably mediates interactions with both G proteins and arrestins and serves to maintain the receptor transmembranes in an inactive conformation in the absence of ligand (11Barak L.S.

Scattered residues on the first two rhodopsin intracellular loops have been identified as contributing to visual arrestin binding exclusive of the phosphorylated rhodopsin C-tail (4Raman D. Osawa S.

In particular, a proline residue in the rhodopsin second intracellular loop distal to the ERY motif is involved (4Raman D. Osawa S. Gurevich V.V. Weiss E.R. J. Neurochem. 2003; 84: 1040-1050Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 17Raman D. Osawa S. Weiss E.R. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 5117-5123Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). In addition, computational modeling of molecular docking between rhodopsin and G proteins highlights that this proline and other residues of the second loop may directly engage transducin (18Filipek S.

Although many of the biochemical behaviors observed for rhodopsin in the visual system generalize to the larger subfamily of class I rhodopsin-like GPCRs, significant differences remain. For example, regulatory behavior in nonvisual cell systems that does not normally apply to rhodopsin includes β-arrestin, clathrin-mediated receptor endocytosis (19Luttrell L.M. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Cell. Sci. 2002; 115: 455-465Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 20Ferguson S.S. Pharmacol. Rev. 2001; 53: 1-24PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, in the absence of appropriate crystallographic data, the extent to which a rhodopsin paradigm applies to nonvisual GPCRs is unclear (21Demene H. Granier S. Muller D. Guillon G. Dufour M.N.

Our data combined with sequence analysis of over 175 human rhodopsin family GPCRs suggest that in these receptors a contiguous 10-amino acid region beginning with the DRY motif forms a phosphorylation-independent structural determinant for binding β-arrestin.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—[3H]Adenine for measurement of cAMP generation and 125I-cyanopindolol for receptor binding were purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences, and [3H]CGP-12177 was from Amersham Biosciences.

The second loop amino acids were then grouped according to their charge or hydrophobic potential.Fig. 1A shows these relative frequencies determined for receptors where the lead second loop residue is an aspartic acid. (Note, where the lead residue was glutamic acid, a similar frequency result was obtained (data not shown).) The Arg/Lys/His group is the most probable to occur in this loop region, particularly at positions 2 and 8.Fig. 1B presents a plot of the next most common group, the hydrophobic residues Iso/Leu/Val/Phe in red plotted among the basic group (blue). In Fig. 1B, the red and blue horizontal dashed lines show the frequency at which a member of the hydrophobic or basic group, respectively, would be expected to occur randomly. It is notable that the hydrophobic group members Iso/Leu/Val/Phe occur at position 6 98% of the time, a level comparable with the 99% occurrence of arginine at position 2. It is also apparent from Fig. 1A that at position 9 a proline (Pro-9) or alanine (Ala-9) occurs 90% of the time.Fig. 1C summarizes the position frequency analysis in terms of a composite of the most probable receptor sequence. Sub-sequences formed from the first 12 and 11 positions of the 23 positions match the mouse olfactory receptor Olfr843 and human prokineticin receptor 1 exactly, and the most probable match for the entire sequence occurs with the second loop of the human galanin receptor. In the composite second loop, the first 10 residues are highly conserved with positions 1-3 the DRY motif, positions 4-7 and 10 hydrophobic amino acids, position 8 a basic residue, and position 9 a proline/alanine combination. The second loops from position 11 onward show variability with a tendency toward basic residues.Mutagenesis in the Second Loop—Mutation of Arg-2 in the DRY motif has been shown to enhance β-arrestin binding, resulting in constitutively activated/desensitized receptors (24Barak L.S.

Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 11981-11989Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). However, the functional dependence on β-arrestin binding from point substitutions beyond the DRY motif in residues 4-10 has received scant attention, although alanine substitution for Pro-9 in rhodopsin was demonstrated to decrease visual arrestin binding (4Raman D. Osawa S. Gurevich V.V. Weiss E.R. J. Neurochem. 2003; 84: 1040-1050Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 17Raman D. Osawa S. Weiss E.R. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 5117-5123Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Because the crystal structure of rhodopsin in its inactive conformation is known, we computationally modeled through the ExPASy Proteomics Server software DeepView (28Guex N. Peitsch M. Schweve T. Diemand A. DeepView/Swiss-Pdb-Viewer. GlaxoSmithKline, Uxbridge, UK2001Google Scholar) if Ala-9 substitution could preserve a Pro-9 like conformation for the second loop. We used the recently published structure of rhodopsin (Protein Data Bank access code 1U19) (29Okada T. Sugihara M. Bondar A.N. Elstner M. Entel P. Buss V. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 342: 571-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (930) Google Scholar), which has a completely resolved polypeptide chain and is also in agreement with the model of the rhodopsin oligomer (30Filipek S.

Not only is the alanine-computed conformation of the second loop practically identical to the native one, perturbations in the bond angles quickly dampen within 1-2 residues of the proline (Fig. 2B). Moreover, this region formed with the side chains of residues 3-10 centered about Pro-9 (Fig. 2C) occupies the center of an accessible region at the lower intracellular face of rhodopsin that has been demonstrated as a docking determinant for the G protein transducin (18Filipek S.

Nature. 1997; 387: 303-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (853) Google Scholar). Editing affects the second intracellular loop region of the 5-HT2cR starting two residues distal to the DRY motif, resulting in at least 14 distinct isoforms with different degrees of constitutive activity (34Burns C.M. Chu H. Rueter S.M. Hutchinson L.K. Canton H. Sanders-Bush E. Emeson R.B. Nature. 1997; 387: 303-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (853) Google Scholar, 35Liu Y. Emeson R.B. Samuel C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18351-18358Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). RNA editing changes amino acids 6, 8, and 10 (Ile, Asn, and Ile) that surround the second loop Pro-9 and impairs the ability of 5-HT2cR isoforms to constitutively internalize in a β-arrestin-dependent manner (25Marion S. Weiner D.M. Caron M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 2945-2954Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). We therefore investigated whether Pro-9 in the 5HT2cR played an active role in this β-arrestin regulation by assessing the functional consequences of a Pro-9 to Ala-9 substitution. Additionally, introducing an Ala-9 was motivated by the fact that alanine is the most likely natural replacement residue to occur at this position in GPCRs (Fig. 1A).We first investigated whether substitution of Pro-9 in the most constitutively active 5HT2cR isoform (i.e. nonedited INI isoform) could affect the subcellular distribution of the receptor. Fig. 3A shows a typical intracellular vesicular pattern of the constitutively internalized GFP-tagged 5HT2cR in the absence of agonist, a pattern that is dependent on its interaction with β-arrestin (21Demene H. Granier S. Muller D. Guillon G. Dufour M.N. Delsuc M.A. Hibert M. Pascal R. Mendre C. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 8204-8213Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). By contrast, the Ala-9 5HT2cR has a much more pronounced plasma membrane presence. To quantify the extent to which the proline/alanine substitution modifies 5HT2cR distribution, we measured by ELISA the cell surface expression of the receptors in the presence of the inverse agonist SB206553 (Fig. 3B), which has been proven to disrupt β-arrestin/5HT2cR constitutive interaction (21Demene H. Granier S. Muller D. Guillon G. Dufour M.N. Delsuc M.A. Hibert M. Pascal R. Mendre C. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 8204-8213Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). 15 min of SB206553 treatment resulted in an absolute 26 ± 3% increase of Pro-9 5HT2cR expression at the cell surface. No significant variation of the Ala-9 5HT2cR was detected. After 30 min of inverse agonist treatment, 30 ± 3 and 8 ± 3% increases in cell surface expression were obtained for the Pro-9 and Ala-9 5HT2cRs, respectively, suggesting that in contrast to the 5HT2cR-INI a majority of the Ala-9 5HT2cRs already resides at the plasma membrane in the absence of agonist and therefore interacts much less well with β-arrestins.FIGURE 3Effects of proline substitution in the second intracellular loop of the constitutively active 5HT2cR.

Weiner D.M. Caron M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 2945-2954Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Therefore, by using a co-immunoprecipitation strategy, we tested whether the proline substitution affects this constitutive association (Fig. 3C). Under basal conditions an alanine substitution of Pro-9 led to a 4-fold decrease in the amount of β-arrestin2-GFP co-immunoprecipitated by the 5HT2cR (Fig. 3, D and C).It is well established that 5HT2c receptors interact with Gq to stimulate phospholipase C (36Chang M.S. Tam J.P. Sanders-Bush E. Sci. STKE 2000. 2000; : PL1Google Scholar, 37Price R.D. Weiner D.M. Chang M.S. Sanders-Bush E. J. Biol.

Consequently, we investigated by co-immunoprecipitation of the receptor with Gq (Fig. 3E) whether Pro-9 substitution would also affect Gq coupling to the constitutively active 5HT2cR. Under basal conditions and compared with the wild type, the Ala-9 5HT2cR produced a 4-fold decrease of co-immunoprecipitated Gq (Fig. 3F). Altogether these data provide strong evidence that the experimental substitution of Pro-9 as well as naturally occurring editing processes in positions 6, 8, and 10 regulate receptor coupling to the cognate G protein as well as β-arrestin interaction.Substitution of Proline 9 in β2-Adrenergic Receptor—We next evaluated whether the Pro-9 could modulate β-arrestin binding to a nonconstitutively active receptor. For this purpose we used the well characterized β2AR. We assessed ligand binding characteristics and G protein coupling for both wild type and mutant receptors (Table 1). The data presented in Table 1 are consistent with a relatively mild loss of G protein coupling for the Ala-9 β2AR. In order to assess in detail whether substitution of Pro-9 affects coupling between the receptor and its cognate G protein, the interaction between each receptor and the G protein was measured by receptor-stimulated binding of nonhydrolyzable GTP analogues (Fig. 4A). A 1 log decrease in affinity for the Ala-9 β2AR was observed (Table 1 and Fig. 4A).TABLE 1Binding characteristics of the Ala-9 and Pro-9 β2 ARsKD 125I-CypKhigh for isoR in high affinity statepmnm%Pro-9 β2AR61 ± 133.4 ± 1.539 ± 2Ala-9 β2AR26 ± 334 ± 1016 ± 1Maximum amount of GTPγS bindingGTPγS EC50Maximum amount of cAMPEC50 for cAMP productionnmnmPro-9 β2AR1.00 ± 0.057 ± 31.00 ± 0.054.9 ± 1Ala-9 β2AR0.83 ± 0.0481 ± 191.34 ± 0.074.4 ± 2 Open table in a new tab FIGURE 4Effects of proline substitution in the second intracellular loop of the β2AR.

A family of viral and cellular proteins, known as FLIP, plays an essential role in the regulation of death receptor signaling. Viral FLIP (v-FLIP) and short cellular FLIP (c-FLIPS) inhibit apoptosis by interfering with death receptor signaling. The structure and mechanisms of v-FLIP and c-FLIPS remain largely unknown. Here we report a high resolution crystal structure of MC159, a v-FLIP derived from the molluscum contagiosum virus, which is a member of the human poxvirus family. Unexpectedly, the two tandem death effector domains (DEDs) of MC159 rigidly associate with each other through a hydrophobic interface. Structure-based sequence analysis suggests that this interface is conserved in the tandem DEDs from other v-FLIP, c-FLIPS, and caspase-8 and -10. Strikingly, the overall packing arrangement between the two DEDs of MC159 resembles that between the caspase recruitment domains of Apaf-1 and caspase-9. In addition, each DED of MC159 contains a highly conserved binding motif on the surface, to which loss-of-function mutations in MC159 map. These observations, in conjunction with published evidence, reveal significant insights into the function of v-FLIP and suggest a mechanism by which v-FLIP and c-FLIPS inhibit death receptor signaling.

Immunol. 2000; 12: 719-724Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). The pathways of apoptosis are evolutionarily conserved, culminating in the activation of death proteases, known as caspases (named after cysteine protease with Asp substrate specificity) (11Riedl S.J. Shi Y. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 5: 897-907Crossref PubMed Scopus (1582) Google Scholar, 12Thornberry N.A. Lazebnik Y. Science. 1998; 281: 1312-1316Crossref PubMed Scopus (6178) Google Scholar). In mammalian cells, apoptosis manifests in two forms, intrinsic and extrinsic, which are triggered by cell death stimuli from intra- and extracellular environments, respectively. The extracellular death stimuli, such as the Fas/CD95 ligand, directly activate the death receptors through ligand-induced assembly of a death-inducing signaling complex (DISC) 2The abbreviations used are: DISC, death-inducing signaling complex; TNFR1, tumor necrosis factor receptor 1; TRAIL, TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand; DD, death domain; DED, death effector domain; CARD, caspase recruitment domain; SeMet, seleno-methionine; MAD, multiwavelength anomalous dispersion; r.m.s.d., root-mean-square deviation. at the plasma membrane (13Nagata S.

The assembly of DISC results in the activation of caspase-8, which subsequently activates the effector caspases, caspase-3 and -7 (11Riedl S.J. Shi Y. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 5: 897-907Crossref PubMed Scopus (1582) Google Scholar). The death receptor family comprises at least eight members, in which the TNFR1, Fas, and TRAIL receptors have been shown to activate apoptosis for immune system functions such as surveillance and elimination of virally infected or cancerous cells (15Ozoren N. El-Deiry W.S. Semin. Cancer Biol. 2003; 13: 135-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). The activated death ligands are homo-trimeric and thus induce oligomerization of the death receptors upon binding. The death receptors subsequently recruit the adaptor protein FADD (or TRADD for TNFR1) through direct interaction between a death domain (DD) present in both proteins (16Holler N. Tardivel A. Kovacsovics-Bankowski M. Hertig S. Gaide O. Martinon F. Tinel A. Deperthes D. Calderara S. Schulthess T. Engel J. Schneider P. Tschopp J. Mol. Cell.

FADD, in turn, uses its death effector domain (DED) to interact with the N-terminal tandem DEDs of procaspase-8 or procaspase-10, thereby linking these initiator caspases to the activated death receptors within the DISC (19Kischkel F.C.

Thus the assembly of DISC relies on homotypic DD and DED interactions and effectively facilitates the activation of initiator caspases. To evade the host immune response, a number of viruses express distinct families of inhibitory proteins to suppress apoptosis and to promote their replication and survival in host cells (22Thome M. Tschopp J. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2001; 1: 50-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). One important family of such proteins is the viral FLICE-inhibitory proteins (v-FLIPs), which were initially identified in molluscum contagiosum virus and in several γ-herpesviruses (22Thome M. Tschopp J. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2001; 1: 50-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). v-FLIPs have been shown to block the activation of the death receptors at the level of DISC assembly (22Thome M. Tschopp J. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2001; 1: 50-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). Some of the representative v-FLIP proteins include molluscum contagiosum virus MC159, equine herpesvirus-2 E8, herpesvirus saimiri ORF16, bovine herpesvirus-4 E2, and Kaposi's sarcoma associated herpesvirus (KSHV/HHV8) K13 (23Bertin J.

The hallmark of all v-FLIP proteins is two DED domains in tandem, which are also present in the prodomains of caspase-8 and caspase-10. The presence of DEDs in v-FLIP immediately suggests potential interaction with FADD and caspase-8. Indeed, the DEDs of MC159 and E8 have been shown to interact with the DED of FADD and the prodomain of caspase-8 (23Bertin J. Armstrong R.C. Ottilie S. Martin D.A. Wang Y. Banks S. Wang G.H.

Through homotypic DED interactions, the v-FLIPs are thought to hinder efficient recruitment and subsequent activation of caspase-8 at the death receptors. Long and short cellular homologues of the v-FLIP have also been identified as c-FLIPL and c-FLIPS, respectively (22Thome M. Tschopp J. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2001; 1: 50-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). In addition to the tandem DEDs, c-FLIPL contains a caspase-like domain. For both c-FLIPS and c-FLIPL, their tandem DEDs appear to antagonize death receptor signaling in the same manner when expressed at high levels (24Hu S. Vincenz C. Buller M. Dixit V.M. J. Biol.

Although the DED-containing proteins are known to control apoptosis from death receptors, the underlying mechanisms remain largely unknown. This is in part due to the technical difficulty in working with membrane-associated protein complexes. As a consequence, there is a lack of comprehensive structural information on the relevant proteins and protein complexes. At present, we only have limited structural information on the isolated DED of FADD (37Eberstadt M. Huang B. Chen Z. Meadows R.P. Ng S.-C. Zheng L. Lenardo M.J. Fesik S.W.

The preparation of the seleno-methionine (SeMet)-substituted MC159 (residues 1-183) was as described (44Li W. Srinivasula S.M. Chai J. Li P. Wu J.-W. Zhang Z. Alnemri E.S. Shi Y. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 436-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). Crystallization and Data Collection—Similar rod-shaped crystals of native and SeMet MC159 protein (residues 1-183) were grown overnight at room temperature using the hanging drop vapor diffusion method. The best SeMet crystals were generated by streak seeding under the condition of 0.2 m sodium acetate, 0.1 m Tris hydrochloride, pH 8.5, and 14% polyethylene glycol 3350, with 0.5 μl of 1 m ammonium sulfate additive. Data were collected at the X25 beam line of Brookhaven National Synchrotron Light Source. MAD data were collected at the Selenium K edge to a maximum resolution of 1.5 Å. A native data set was collected at 1.4 Å using a crystal grown at the same conditions as the SeMet crystals except 16% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 3350 was used. Both crystals were cryoprotected in a buffer containing 0.2 m sodium acetate, 0.1 m Tris hydrochloride, pH 8.5, 18% w/v polyethylene glycol 3350, 0.15 m ammonium acetate, and 10% glycerol. The crystals had a primitive orthorhombic space group with unit cell dimensions of a = 35 Å, b = 63 Å, c = 76 Å, and a = b = c = 90°. Unit cell dimensions were consistent with one molecule per asymmetric unit. Structure Determination—For the MAD experiments, data were processed using the HKL suite of programs (45Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38592) Google Scholar). Systematic absences for reflections of classes h00, 0k0, and 00l in both the SeMet and native data strongly indicated that the space group was P212121. The SHELX suite of programs (46Sheldrick G.M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1990; 46: 467-473Crossref Scopus (19249) Google Scholar) was used to extract experimental phase information. The MAD data were prepared for structure determination with SHELXC, and four out of five possible selenium atom sites were found by SHELXD. The contrast in the solvent-flattened electron density maps in SHELXE unambiguously distinguished between the correct and inverted heavy atom locations (contrast of 0.445 and 0.268, respectively). The electron density map, generated from SHELXE, was clearly interpretable, and given the high resolution of the MAD data, the structure was automatically build from solvent-flattened MAD phases calculated to 1.5-Å resolution using the program ARP/wARP (47Perrakis A. Morris R. Lamzin V.S. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 458-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (2563) Google Scholar). Further manual building using the program O (48Jones T.A. Zou J.-Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13014) Google Scholar) and refinement using the program CNS (49Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. Delano W.L. Gros P.

Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16978) Google Scholar) completed the structure. The final atomic model of MC159, refined to 1.4-Å resolution, contains residues 7-183. There is no electron density for residues 1-6, and we presume that these residues are flexible and disordered in the crystals. Overall Structure of the Tandem DEDs of MC159—The full-length MC159 protein (residues 1-241) consists of two tandem DEDs and a C-terminal extension. Both sequence analysis and limited proteolysis indicated that the C-terminal extension of MC159 is flexible and disordered in solution. Because flexible sequences may impede crystallization, we generated and purified a truncated version (residues 1-183) of MC159, which contains the two tandem DEDs but lacks the C-terminal extension. We crystallized the truncated MC159 and determined its structure using multiwavelength anomalous dispersion (MAD). The atomic model was refined to 1.4-Å resolution (Table 1).TABLE 1Statistics of crystallographic analysisSeMetData collectionNativePeakInflectionHigh remoteLow remoteWavelength (Å)0.97950.97900.97940.96410.9800Resolution (Å)50-1.450-1.7550-1.7550-1.7550-1.5Total observations153,552102,394102,687102,27796,746Unique reflections33,49517,76417,71717,70828,066R-sym (%)3.67.36.86.84.6Completeness (%)98.099.398.998.899.4RefinementResolution (Å)50-1.450-1.5Reflections (|F| > 0)31,04426267Completeness (%)91.293.4R-factor (%)20.619.5R-free (%)23.621.7No. atoms13761376No. waters174175r.m.s.d. bond lengths0.0140.014r.m.s.d. bond angles1.621.64r.m.s.d.

The two DED domains can be superimposed onto each other with a root-mean-squared deviation (r.m.s.d.) of 1.78 Å over 60 aligned Cα atoms (Fig. 1C). The first DED domain (DED1, residues 7-78) of MC159 only contains five α-helices and represents a departure from the canonical death motif fold (Fig. 1A). Consequently, DED1 of MC159 is superimposed with the DED of FADD (37Eberstadt M. Huang B. Chen Z. Meadows R.P. Ng S.-C. Zheng L. Lenardo M.J. Fesik S.W. Nature. 1998; 392: 941-945Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar) with an r.m.s.d. of 1.84 Å over only 45 aligned Cα atoms. These 45 aligned amino acids come from helices α1a, α2a, α5a, and α6a in DED1. Compared with the DED of FADD (37Eberstadt M. Huang B. Chen Z. Meadows R.P. Ng S.-C. Zheng L. Lenardo M.J. Fesik S.W. Nature. 1998; 392: 941-945Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar) and the second DED (DED2, residues 93-183) of MC159, the third α-helix is reduced to a rigid loop in DED1 of MC159. Sequence analysis suggests that this structural feature might be unique to MC159, because, compared with FADD and other proteins, MC159 lacks a few conserved residues in the region that corresponds to the α3a helix (Fig. 2). In contrast, the second DED domain (DED2, residues 93-183) of MC159 can be superimposed with the DED of FADD with an r.m.s.d. of 1.57 Å over 80 aligned Cα atoms, which cover all six α-helices and most of the intervening loop sequences (Fig. 1D).FIGURE 2Structure-based sequence alignment of the DED regions from v-FLIPs, c-FLIP, FADD, and caspase-8 and caspase-10. Secondary structural elements are indicated above the MC159 sequences. Conserved residues are highlighted in yellow. The conserved binding elements on the surface of DED1 and DED2 are indicated, with the residues under red background. Residues that contribute to the interactions between DED1 and DED2 are identified with blue triangles. The highly conserved residues that play important stabilizing roles at the DED interface are identified by black dots underneath the sequences. The effect of alanine-scanning mutagenesis is indicated by colored squares above the sequences: red, loss-of-function; yellow, partial loss-of-function; green, no effect (52Garvey T.L. Bertin J.

Unexpectedly, the two DED domains of MC159 rigidly associate with each other through a hydrophobic interface, involving ∼1450 Å 2The abbreviations used are: DISC, death-inducing signaling complex; TNFR1, tumor necrosis factor receptor 1; TRAIL, TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand; DD, death domain; DED, death effector domain; CARD, caspase recruitment domain; SeMet, seleno-methionine; MAD, multiwavelength anomalous dispersion; r.m.s.d., root-mean-square deviation. of buried surface area. The close stacking between the two DED domains of MC159 creates a deep surface groove that encircles the molecule (Fig. 1B). This surface groove is lined with a number of acidic amino acids that give rise to a highly negatively charged surface. In contrast, the two opposing ends of the MC159 structure are less charged and contain a number of hydrophobic residues. Conserved Interactions at the DED1-DED2 Interface—Of the three classes of signaling motifs in apoptosis, only DED is known to occur in tandem, and the tandem DEDs are present in all known v-FLIPs, c-FLIPL, c-FLIPS, caspase-8, and caspase-10 (Fig. 2). One important finding from the structure of MC159 is the unexpected revelation that the two tandem DED domains pack closely against each other through a large hydrophobic interface. At this interface, α2a in DED1 plays a dominant role by binding to α1b and α4b of DED2 (Figs. 2 and 3A). Another helix from DED1, α5a, also contributes to this interface by making additional interactions at the periphery (Fig. 3A). At the center of the interface, Phe-30 and Leu-31, both from α2a in DED1, make multiple van der Waals contacts to a complementary hydrophobic surface in DED2, formed by Val-101, Val-137, and Leu-141 and the aliphatic portion of side chains of Arg-97 and Lys-98 (Fig. 3A). At the periphery, Leu-27 and Val-66 in DED1 make additional interactions with hydrophobic residues in DED2. These hydrophobic interactions are further buttressed by five inter-domain hydrogen bonds (Fig. 3A). In particular, Asp-34 in DED1 accepts a pair of charge-stabilized hydrogen bonds from Arg-97 in DED2. Structural and sequence analysis indicates that the interactions at the DED1-DED2 interface are highly conserved among all proteins that contain tandem DED domains (Figs. 2 and 3A). Among the residues that mediate interactions at the center of the interface, Phe-30, Leu-31, Arg-97, Val-137, and Leu-141, are either preserved or replaced by similar residues in all proteins that contain tandem DED domains (Fig. 2). Moreover, the hydrogen bonds between Asp-34 and Arg-97 are also predicted to be conserved in a majority of these proteins (Fig. 2). This analysis strongly suggests that the rigid structure of MC159 and the interface determinants between the tandem DEDs are representative of v-FLIPs, c-FLIP, caspase-8, and caspase-10. Similarity with CARD-CARD Interactions—Because there is no prior structural information on any DED·DED complex or on any tandem DED-containing protein, we initially assumed that the packing arrangement between the two DED domains of MC159 might represent a novel arrangement. To confirm this assumption, we used the atomic coordinates of the MC159 protein to search the protein data base using the program DALI (50Holm L. Sander C. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 233: 123-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (3566) Google Scholar) as well as our own automated homology search program (P. D. J.). To our surprise, the packing interactions between the two DEDs of MC159 were found to be significantly homologous to those between the CARD domains of Apaf-1 and caspase-9 (51Qin H. Srinivasula S.M. Wu G. Fernandes-Alnemri T. Alnemri E.S. Shi Y. Nature. 1999; 399: 547-555Crossref Scopus (362) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3B), with an r.m.s.d. of 1.8 Å over 85 aligned Cα atoms in both domains. The relative domain orientation and the interface are both very similar. In both cases, the α2 helix in DED1 of MC159 or in Apaf-1 CARD plays a dominant role in binding to helices α1 and α4 in DED2 of MC159 or in caspase-9 CARD (51Qin H. Srinivasula S.M. Wu G. Fernandes-Alnemri T. Alnemri E.S. Shi Y. Nature. 1999; 399: 547-555Crossref Scopus (362) Google Scholar). The inter-domain hydrogen bonds from Asp-34 of DED1 to Arg-97 of DED2 (Fig. 3A) are also reminiscent of the CARD-CARD interactions, where acidic residues from Apaf-1 hydrogen bond to basic residues in caspase-9 (51Qin H. Srinivasula S.M. Wu G. Fernandes-Alnemri T. Alnemri E.S. Shi Y. Nature. 1999; 399: 547-555Crossref Scopus (362) Google Scholar). This analysis indicates that, despite a lack of apparent sequence homology, the DED1-DED2 interface observed in MC159 is very similar to the CARD-CARD interface between Apaf-1 and caspase-9. This observation further suggests that the tandem DED domains in FLIP and caspases might have arisen from gene transfer (from another interacting protein) rather than gene duplication (within the same protein). Classification of Mutations in MC159—As one of the first v-FLIP proteins to be identified, MC159 had been subjected to intense investigation. In particular, an extensive alanine-scanning mutagenesis was performed on MC159 to identify important amino acids that are critical for its anti-apoptotic function in vivo (52Garvey T.L. Bertin J. Siegel R.M. Wang G.H. Lenardo M.J. Cohen J.I. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 697-706Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). This effort led to the identification of a comprehensive set of amino acids in both DEDs that are required to protect HeLa and Jurkat cells from apoptosis induced by TNFR1, Fas, and TRAIL receptors (52Garvey T.L. Bertin J. Siegel R.M. Wang G.H. Lenardo M.J. Cohen J.I. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 697-706Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). In conjunction with the structure, the mutagenesis information gives us an unprecedented opportunity to map the critical residues onto the surface of MC159 and to further identify critical surface motifs necessary for the anti-apoptotic function of MC159. The mutations may disrupt the function of MC159 by two distinct possibilities: to destabilize the structure or to affect a functional surface that is required for binding to other protein(s). To differentiate between these two possibilities, we first examined the solvent accessibility of all residues that were targeted for alanine scanning mutagenesis (Fig. 2) and classified the mutations into two categories: structural or non-structural (Table 2). Then we correlated the classification with the in vivo phenotypes (Table 2) and mapped all mutations onto the surface of the MC159 structure (Fig. 4, A and B). As expected, some mutations affect residues that are deeply buried, such as mutant 5 (E62A), mutant 17 (F30A), mutant 21 (L72A/L73A), mutant 24 (L31A), and mutant 40 (L28A/L29A/L31) (Table 2). These mutations are likely to destabilize the structure of MC159, thus crippling its function. Interestingly, amo"

Nevertheless, the archaeal enzyme presents an unprecedented homotrimeric molecular arrangement both in solution, as determined by analytical ultracentrifugation, and in the crystal. The C-domains are not involved in intersubunit interactions of the trimeric molecule, thus allowing for movements, likely required for catalysis, across the narrow hinge that connects the N- and C-domains.

Comparison of bacterial and eukaryotic glycogen synthases, which use, respectively, ADP or UDP glucose as donor substrates, with the archaeal enzyme, which can utilize both molecules, allowed us to propose the residues that determine glucosyl donor specificity.

Glycogen (starch in plants) is a polymer of α-1,4- and α-1,6-linked glucose units that provides a readily available source of energy in living organisms of the three domains: archaea, bacteria, and eukarya. Polymerization is performed by specific glycosyltransferases (GT) 2The abbreviations used are: GT, glycosyltransferase; GS, glycogen synthase; PaGS, P. abyssi GS; AtGS, A. tumefaciens GS; r.m.s.d., root mean square deviation. 2The abbreviations used are: GT, glycosyltransferase; GS, glycogen synthase; PaGS, P. abyssi GS; AtGS, A. tumefaciens GS; r.m.s.d., root mean square deviation. of the GT-3 and GT-5 families, named glycogen (GS) or starch synthases, which catalyze the formation of α-1,4-glycosidic bonds using UDP- or ADP-glucose as the glucosyl donor. The α-1,6-linked branches are introduced in the synthetic direction and eliminated in the catabolic pathway by various transglycosidases of the GH-13 family. Glycogen can be degraded phosphorolytically by glycogen phosphorylases (GT-35) or hydrolytically by α-amylases (GH-13) (1Henrissat B. Deleury E. Coutinho P.M. Trends Genet. 2002; 18: 437-440Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Few organisms are devoid of glycogen-active enzymes, and in bacteria it has been suggested that the absence of glycogen metabolism is a marker of host-dependent (parasitic or symbiotic) behavior. Thus, the capacity to synthesize and utilize glycogen appears to be central for the survival of “free-living” bacteria (1Henrissat B. Deleury E. Coutinho P.M. Trends Genet. 2002; 18: 437-440Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). In higher eukaryotae, glycogen and glycogen-metabolizing enzymes are present in almost every cell type, again pointing to the crucial role of this metabolic pathway in the carbon/energy metabolism of the cell. Animal and fungal GS are grouped in family GT-3 on the basis of a high degree of sequence identity (45-50%) (2Campbell J.A. Davies G.J. Bulone V. Henrissat B. Biochem. J. 1997; 326: 929-939Crossref PubMed Scopus (625) Google Scholar, 3Coutinho, P. M., and Henrissat, B. (1999) http://afmb.cnrs-mrs.fr/CAZY/(Carbohydrate-Active Enzymes server)Google Scholar). GT-3 enzymes have two other characteristics in common: they use UDP glucose as the glucosyl donor, and they are tightly regulated by reversible phosphorylation and by allosteric effectors, mainly glucose-6-phosphate. The structural information available for these enzymes is limited (to date, no enzyme of the GT-3 family has been structurally solved) and conflicting with regard to their oligomerization state. Different studies conclude that mammalian GS can exist either as dimers, trimers, or tetramers (4Jett M.F. Soderling T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 6739-6745Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 5Takeda Y. Brewer Jr., H.B. Larner J. J. Biol.

Chem. 1977; 252: 7812-7817Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), while the fungal GS from Neurospora crassa has been reported to be a trimer (7Takahara H. Matsuda K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1978; 522: 363-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). In contrast to animal/fungal GS, bacterial GS and plant starch synthase, which are classified in the GT-5 family, are non-regulated enzymes and use ADP glucose exclusively as the source of glucose moieties. The first three-dimensional structure of an enzyme of this family has recently been reported (8Buschiazzo A. Ugalde J.E. Guerin M.E. Shepard W. Ugalde R.A. Alzari P.M. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 3196-3205Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). The bacterial GS from Agrobacterium tumefaciens (AtGS) is a homodimeric protein in which each subunit presents the characteristic GT-B fold, composed of two Rossmann fold domains (9Coutinho P.M. Deleury E. Davies G.J. Henrissat B. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 328: 307-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (920) Google Scholar). Although the primary sequence identity of archaeal and bacterial GS (20-40% similarity) has led to their classification in the GT-5 family, the archaeal enzymes share several structural features with their animal/fungal counterparts of the GT-3 family (10Cid E. Geremia R.A. Guinovart J.J. Ferrer J.C. FEBS Lett. 2002; 528: 5-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 11Cid E. Gomis R.R. Geremia R.A. Guinovart J.J. Ferrer J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 33614-33621Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Furthermore, archaeal GS use both ADP- and UDP-glucose as glucosyl donors with similar efficiency (12Gruyer S. Legin E. Bliard C. Ball S. Duchiron F. Curr.

These observations are not unexpected given the higher phylogenetic proximity of eukaryotic to archaeal enzymes in comparison with their bacterial counterparts (15Woese C.R. Kandler O. Wheelis M.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 4576-4579Crossref PubMed Scopus (4492) Google Scholar). Here we report the crystallographic structure of the archaeal GS from Pyrococcus abyssi, which is the smallest known enzyme of the glycogen/starch synthase superfamily (GT-3 and GT-5). Protein Expression, Crystallization, and Data Collection—A Histagged form of the full-length PaGS, which was expressed in Escherichia coli as inclusion bodies, was purified and refolded as described (14Horcajada C. Cid E. Guinovart J.J. Verdaguer N. Ferrer J.C. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2003; 59: 2322-2324Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Small needle-shaped crystals were obtained using the vapor diffusion method with 100 mm sodium citrate, pH 5.6, containing 20% polyethylene glycol 4000 and 20% dioxane. Microseeding was performed by crushing these crystals with the seed bead kit (Sigma) and adding them to new drops containing 15% polyethylene glycol 4000 and 20% dioxane. The larger needles produced were further enlarged by macroseeding in the same buffer until ∼0.01 × 0.01 × 1.0 mm3 in size. Finally, the crystals were frozen in liquid nitrogen in the presence of a cryoprotectant solution (the same mother liquor except for 20% glycerol). A complete x-ray diffraction data set was collected at 100 K (beamline ID14-EH2, European Synchrotron Radiation Facility, Grenoble) and processed using DENZO/SCALEPACK (16Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38526) Google Scholar) and TRUNCATE4.1 (17Collaborative Computational Project Number 4Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19748) Google Scholar). The cDNA encoding the C-domain of PaGS (amino acids Gly-218 to Ser-413) was amplified by PCR using specific primers and cloned into the plasmid pET28a+ (Novagen), which adds a His6 tag and a thrombin cleavage site at the N terminus. A culture of E. coli BL21-CodonPlus (DE3)-RIL (Stratagene) transformed with the constructed plasmid was grown in Luria Bertani medium supplemented with 34 μg ml-1 chlor amphenicol and 10 μgml-1 kanamycin. After 24 h at 37 °C, cells were harvested and resuspended in a buffer containing 500 mm NaCl, 10 mm imidazole, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 mm dithiothreitol in 20 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.4. After sonication, the suspension was centrifuged for 20 min at 10,000 × g and loaded onto a HisTrap nickel-chelating column (Amersham Biosciences). The recombinant protein was eluted with a linear gradient of 10-500 mm imidazole, the positive fractions were pooled, and the buffer was replaced by 10 mm CaCl2/50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8. The His tag was cleaved by incubating the sample with a thrombin-agarose suspension (Sigma) for 12 h at room temperature. To separate the cleaved and uncleaved portions, the solution was reloaded onto a new HisTrap nickel-chelating column, and the unbound fractions were collected. After loading onto a Superdex 200 HR10/30 gel filtration column (Amersham Biosciences), the protein was eluted with a buffer containing 500 mm NaCl and 1 mm dithiothreitol in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, as a single peak and was brought to a final concentration of 10 mg ml-1. The purified protein ran as a single band of ∼25 kDa on an SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Crystals were obtained using the sitting drop vapor diffusion method at 4 °C, with 19% polyethylene glycol 8000 and 50 mm Li2SO4 as precipitants, buffered in 100 mm sodium acetate, pH 4.6. The crystals, which grew to ∼0.1 × 0.1 × 0.1 mm3 in size in 3-4 days, had a cubic morphology and were monoclinic (space group P21). A complete x-ray diffraction data set was collected at 100 K from a single crystal that had been frozen in liquid nitrogen in a cryogenic solution (20% glycerol), (beamline BM16, European Synchrotron Radiation Facility). Data were processed and scaled using MOSFLM6.2.0 and SCALA2.7.5 (17Collaborative Computational Project Number 4Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol.

Structure Determination and Refinement—All attempts to determine the PaGS structure using heavy atom or SeMet derivatives were unsuccessful. After the AtGS structure became available (8Buschiazzo A. Ugalde J.E. Guerin M.E. Shepard W. Ugalde R.A. Alzari P.M. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 3196-3205Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar), molecular replacement trials were attempted that included the use of the locked rotation and locked translation functions (18Tong L. Rossmann M.G. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 594-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). Because this approach also failed, an alternative and cumbersome scheme that consisted of first solving one of the two PaGS domains was planned. For the crystals of the PaGS C-terminal domain, molecular replacement gave an unambiguous solution for a polyalanine model derived from the C-domain of AtGS, with one domain in the asymmetric unit. Phases of the initial solution were improved by rigid body refinement (REFMAC5) (17Collaborative Computational Project Number 4Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19748) Google Scholar) and density modification (17Collaborative Computational Project Number 4Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19748) Google Scholar). Model completion was achieved by alternating steps of automatic refinement and manual rebuilding, using the graphic program O (19Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13009) Google Scholar). Refinement was performed with all the diffraction data available (25-1.8 Å), except the 5% randomly selected data, to calculate the Rfree. B-factor restraints were gradually loosened as refinement progressed. Solvent positions were assigned using ARP/wARP (17Collaborative Computational Project Number 4Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19748) Google Scholar) and cross-checked manually. The density map also showed the presence of two acetate and four sulfate ions from the crystallization buffer. The stereochemical quality of the model, analyzed with PROCHECK (20Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar), indicated that the main chain conformational angles were all located within favored regions of the Ramachandran diagram. Molecular replacement with the full-length PaGS, using its C-domain as a starting partial model, was then attempted. A possible solution was obtained at 3.5 Å resolution, corresponding to three C-domains in the asymmetric unit. To complete each subunit of the trimer, a second search was performed using as a model the N-domain of AtGS with all the side chains converted to Ala. Graphic evaluation with the program O (19Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13009) Google Scholar) confirmed that the connectivity between domains and the global packing were correct. Initial rigid body refinement was performed with REFMAC5 (17Collaborative Computational Project Number 4Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19748) Google Scholar), assuming six rigid bodies (the N- and C-terminal domains of each monomer). Phases were improved by density modification using solvent flattening, histogram matching, and three-dimensional fold non-crystallographic symmetry averaging. Graphic model building was alternated with automatic refinement, excluding 5% of randomly selected data to calculate the Rfree. TLS refinement was performed assuming two rigid bodies (N- and C-domains)/monomer. The model showed good stereochemistry with only 1 residue (Asp-128) in a disallowed region of the Ramachandran plot.

Open table in a new tab Sedimentation Equilibrium Centrifugation—Sedimentation equilibrium experiments were performed using an Optima XL-A analytical ultracentrifuge (Beckman). Protein solutions (1, 0.5, 0.01 mg ml-1) were centrifuged at 10,000 × g at 10 °C until equilibrium was achieved. The molecular weight of PaGS was estimated by fitting a theoretical curve to the observed radial distribution of the protein concentration in the centrifugation cell, using the program Origin v6.1 (OriginLab). Transmission Electron Microscopy—Samples for transmission electron microscopy were prepared using the conventional negative staining procedure. A 20-μl drop of protein solution (0.2 mg ml-1) was adsorbed onto a glow-ionized carbon-coated copper grid, washed with two drops of deionized water, and stained with two drops of freshly prepared 2% uranyl acetate solution. Samples were imaged at room temperature using a Jeol JEM 1010 transmission electron microscope, working at 80 KV. Images were collected at a ×300,000 magnification. Sequence Alignments—Multiple sequence alignments of GT-3 and GT-5 enzymes were performed with the program CLUSTALW v1.83 (21Thompson J.D. Higgins D.G. Gibson T.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4673-4680Crossref PubMed Scopus (55629) Google Scholar). Combined structural and multiple sequence alignments were performed using the program ESPript (22Gouet P. Courcelle E. Stuart D.I. Metoz F. Bioinformatics. 1999; 15: 305-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (2523) Google Scholar). Monomer Folding—The crystal structure of P. abyssi GS (PaGS) has been determined and refined to a resolution of 2.8 Å. The crystal asymmetric unit contains three monomers, each comprising residues from Met-1-Leu-437. Because conventional methods to solve the whole protein proved unsuccessful, the structure of the isolated C-terminal domain was first determined by molecular replacement from the equivalent domain of the bacterial AtGS (8Buschiazzo A. Ugalde J.E. Guerin M.E. Shepard W. Ugalde R.A. Alzari P.M. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 3196-3205Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). The atomic coordinates of this fragment (residues Gly-218-Ser-413 plus an N-terminal extension of 3 residues), refined at 1.8 Å resolution, were then used to obtain a partial solution for the full-length protein. Structure determination was completed by taking advantage of the non-crystallographic 3-fold symmetry of the molecule (see below). Similar to what has been described for the bacterial AtGS (8Buschiazzo A. Ugalde J.E. Guerin M.E. Shepard W. Ugalde R.A. Alzari P.M. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 3196-3205Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar) and other enzymes of the GT-B fold superfamily (9Coutinho P.M. Deleury E. Davies G.J. Henrissat B. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 328: 307-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (920) Google Scholar), PaGS subunits fold into a pair of Rossmann fold domains separated by a deep cleft in which the catalytic center is located (Fig. 1A). The N-domain of PaGS (residues 1-217 and 414-437) presents a root mean square deviation (r.m.s.d.) of 2.4 Å for the Cα atoms of the 219 residues (79%) having equivalents in the AtGS structure. In the C-domain (residues 218-413), the r.m.s.d. for 183 structurally equivalent residues (86%) between PaGS and AtGS is 1.3 Å. Sequence identities between the two proteins are 21 and 22% for the N- and C-domains, respectively. The narrow hinge that connects the N- and C-terminal domains is formed by only two chain segments (Fig. 1A), which comprise highly conserved residues among the members of the GT-3 and GT-5 families (Fig. 2). In PaGS, these residues, which present extended conformations, correspond to Asn-217-Gly-218-Ile-219, connecting the N- and C-terminal domains, and Phe-412-Ser-413-Trp-414, between the terminal helices α17/α18, respectively.FIGURE 2Structurally weighted sequence alignment of GS from P. abyssi, A. tumefaciens, rabbit muscle and liver, Caenorhabditis elegans, N. crassa, and yeast Gsy2p. Structurally equivalent regions are boxed, invariant residues are shown in white letters on a red background, and conserved amino acids are shown in red. Secondary structural elements of PaGS (α-helices and β-strands) are shown above its sequence. Several amino acids are marked with triangles: catalytic site (red), charge-relay-like system (dark blue), trimerization hydrophobic tail (orange), and complementary cavity (green), segments connecting the N- and C-terminal domains (pink), residues that interact with glucose moieties in subsites +1 and +2 (light blue). The region responsible for the dimerization of AtGS is underlined in green.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The structure of the isolated C-domain of PaGS was essentially identical to that of the C-terminal domain in the full-length protein (r.m.s.d. of 0.71 Å) (Fig. 1B), with only three noticeable differences. The loop connecting the α16 and α17 helices and that between the β15 strand and the α12 helix (Fig. 2) show small differences that, in the latter case, are probably due to the presence of a buffer-derived acetate ion in the nucleotide binding site of the isolated C-terminal domain (not shown). This observation is in agreement with what has been described for AtGS, in which the equivalent loop slightly changes its main chain trace upon ADP binding (8Buschiazzo A. Ugalde J.E. Guerin M.E. Shepard W. Ugalde R.A. Alzari P.M. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 3196-3205Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Finally, Cys-221 and Cys-350 form a disulfide bridge in the full-length protein that is not observed in the structure of the isolated PaGS C-domain. Oligomeric Structure—Despite the structural similarities between the subunits of the archaeal and bacterial enzymes, PaGS presents a homotrimeric organization, whereas AtGS is a dimeric protein (8Buschiazzo A. Ugalde J.E. Guerin M.E. Shepard W. Ugalde R.A. Alzari P.M. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 3196-3205Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3A). In PaGS, the last α-helix of the C-domain (α17) undergoes a kink at position Ser-413, a common feature of GT-B enzymes, whereas the remaining residues (Trp-414-Thr-426) crossover to the N-domain and recover the α-helix structure for 12 more residues (α18). However, helix α18 of PaGS is continued by an extended and protruding tail, composed mostly by hydrophobic residues (Gly-427-Leu-437), which interacts with a hydrophobic pocket in the N-domain of a neighbor subunit. The total contact area between two subunits is 1410 Å 2The abbreviations used are: GT, glycosyltransferase; GS, glycogen synthase; PaGS, P. abyssi GS; AtGS, A. tumefaciens GS; r.m.s.d., root mean square deviation., of which ∼820 Å 2The abbreviations used are: GT, glycosyltransferase; GS, glycogen synthase; PaGS, P. abyssi GS; AtGS, A. tumefaciens GS; r.m.s.d., root mean square deviation. correspond to hydrophobic contacts. The main interactions are established with amino acids Lys-53-Ile-54-Arg-55, several residues from Arg-105 to Leu-115, and Tyr-141-Phe-142 (Figs. 2 and 3B), resulting in the three N-domains of the PaGS trimer being rigidly bound to each other. In contrast, the C-domains do not participate in intersubunit interactions (Fig. 3A), and consequently the trimeric organization of the PaGS molecule does not restrain movements across the hinge that connects the two domains (Fig. 1A). In fact, although two of the three N-domains are related by an accurate molecular 3-fold axis (the slight deviation of the third N-domain is attributed to crystallographic contacts), the C-domains present clear deviations from a 3-fold symmetry that result in variability in the aperture of the interdomain cleft among the three monomers of the molecule (Fig. 4 and Table 2). For a number of enzymes of the GT-B superfamily, it has been proposed that an inactive “open” state undergoes a substrate-triggered closure movement of the interdomain cleft, thereby bringing together the catalytic residues that make up a competent active center.FIGURE 4Stereographic drawing of the superimposition of the N-terminal domains from the three crystallographically independent PaGS subunits (yellow, green, and orange), showing that the corresponding C-domains do not occupy equivalent positions.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)TABLE 2Superposition of the N- and C-terminal domains of the PaGS subunitsN-terminal domainC-terminal domainSubunitsR.m.s.d.Angle XR.m.s.d.Angle XA-B0.26118.20.42113.7A-C0.27120.10.45121.9B-C0.25120.70.50124.4 Open table in a new tab The polar (directional) character of the molecular 3-fold symmetry of PaGS defines upper and lower sides that show a markedly asymmetric charge distribution: the upper face is mainly positively charged, whereas a large number of acidic residues are exposed on the lower face of the N-terminal domains (Fig. 5A). The arrangement of the subunits in the trimer, with the longest subunit axis almost perpendicular (∼110° for the more open upper face) to the molecular 3-fold axis, gives PaGS a conspicuous triangular shape with a side length of ∼130 Å and a thickness of 40 Å (Fig. 5A). The trimeric molecular organization found in the crystal structure of PaGS was fully supported both by sedimentation equilibrium ultracentrifugation, which provided a molecular mass of 158 kDa for the oligomer in solution (monomer MW, 51144 Da), and by negative staining electron microscopy (Fig. 5B). Oligomerization of Glycogen Synthases—The structural sequence alignment of AtGS and PaGS indicates that the striking differences in molecular organization arise from only a few very specific changes in their sequences (Fig. 2). In particular, with respect to PaGS, the C-domain of AtGS has an insertion of ∼10 residues (407-416) that dominates the interactions between the two AtGS subunits in the asymmetric unit. In turn, AtGS lacks the few hydrophobic residues at the C-terminal end that are critical for the trimeric oligomerization of PaGS (Fig. 3A). Sequence alignments (not shown) indicate that most bacterial GS possess the dimerization insertion and consequently are expected to be dimers. In contrast, this segment is absent in most (apparently all) archaeal GS, which instead have the hydrophobic tail, indicating they likely are organized as trimers. For the larger eukaryotic GS of the GT-3 family, the analysis is more complex. The dimerization helix of AtGS is present, at most, only partly in the eukaryotic enzymes and the amino acid sequence of this segment is not conserved. In contrast, these enzymes hold several structural features that could be indicative of a trimeric oligomerization, in particular the hydrophobic peptide equivalent to the C-terminal tail of PaGS. Although the amino acid identity in this region between the archaeal and the eukaryotic enzymes is not high, most of the changes are conservative (Fig. 2). The oligomerization status of GS from distinct sources is a longstanding debate that dates from the early 70s. Different authors have concluded that mammalian GS can exist either as dimers, trimers, or tetramers (4Jett M.F. Soderling T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 6739-6745Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 5Takeda Y. Brewer Jr., H.B. Larner J. J. Biol.

https://openalex.org/W2147043828,"We have previously identified a novel complex between the platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)? receptor and the sphingosine 1-phosphate receptor-1 (S1P1). The complex permits the utilization of active G-protein subunits (made available by constitutively active S1P1 receptor) by the PDGF? receptor kinase to transmit signals to p42/p44 MAPK in response to PDGF. Therefore, an inverse agonist of the S1P1 receptor is predicted to reduce signal transduction from PDGF? receptor tyrosine kinase by blocking the constitutive activity of the G-protein coupled receptor. SB649146 is a novel inverse agonist of the S1P1 receptor. First, SB649146 displaced the S1P1 receptor agonist dihydrosphingosine 1-phosphate from membranes expressing the recombinant S1P1 receptor. Second, SB649146 reduced basal recombinant S1P1 receptor-induced GTP?S binding and S1P-induced GTP?S binding in membranes. Third, SB649146 blocked the S1P-induced activation of p42/p44 MAPK in airway smooth muscle cells, a response that is mediated by the S1P1 receptor. We now report that inverse agonism of the S1P1 receptor with SB649146 reduced the endocytosis of the PDGF? receptor-S1P1 receptor complex and the stimulation of p42/p44 MAPK and cell migration in response to PDGF. These findings are the first to report that a GPCR inverse-agonist reduces growth factor-induced receptor tyrosine kinase signaling, fundamentally broadening their mechanism of action. The data obtained with SB649146 also suggest that the constitutively active endogenous S1P1 receptor enhances PDGF-induced cell migration."
https://openalex.org/W2069661924,"Prohibitin is a growth-suppressive protein that has multiple functions in the nucleus and the mitochondria. Our earlier studies had shown that prohibitin represses the activity of E2F transcription factors while enhancing p53-mediated transcription. At the same time, prohibitin has been implicated in mediating the proper folding of mitochondrial proteins. We had found that treatment of cells with camptothecin, a topoisomerase 1 inhibitor, led to the export of prohibitin and p53 from the nucleus to the mitochondria. Here we show that the camptothecin-induced export of prohibitin occurs preferentially in transformed cell lines, but not in untransformed or primary cells. Cells that did not display the translocation of prohibitin were refractive to the apoptotic effects of camptothecin. The translocation was mediated by a putative nuclear export signal at the C-terminal region of prohibitin; fusion of the nuclear export signal (NES) of prohibitin to green fluorescence protein led to its export from the nucleus. Leptomycin B could inhibit the nuclear export of prohibitin showing that it was a CRM-1-dependent event driven by Ran GTPase. Confirming this, prohibitin was found to physically interact with CRM-1, and this interaction was significantly higher in transformed cells. Delivery of a peptide corresponding to the NES of prohibitin prevented the export of prohibitin to cytoplasm and protected cells from apoptosis. These results suggest that the regulated translocation of prohibitin from the nucleus to the mitochondria facilitates its pleiotropic functions and might contribute to its anti-proliferative and tumor suppressive properties.

Oncogene. 2002; 21: 4539-4548Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) as well as growth factor withdrawal (25Vander Heiden M.G. Choy J.S. VanderWeele D.J. Brace J.L. Harris M.H. Bauer D.E.

Thus like Rb, prohibitin also possesses the ability to regulate cell proliferation as well as apoptosis. An additional insight into the modulation of apoptosis by prohibitin was provided by the finding that it could physically interact with the p53 tumor suppressor protein and enhance its transcriptional activity (26Fusaro G. Dasgupta P. Rastogi S. Joshi B. Chellappan S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 47853-47861Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). This transcriptional induction was mediated by enhanced recruitment of p53 to its target DNA binding sites, as seen by chromatin immunoprecipitation assays (26Fusaro G. Dasgupta P. Rastogi S. Joshi B. Chellappan S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 47853-47861Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). Prohibitin has been shown to contribute to the folding and transport of mitochondrial proteins, especially in yeast systems (27Berger K.H. Yaffe M.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 4043-4052Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 28Coates P.J. Jamieson D.J. Smart K. Prescott A.R. Hall P.A. Curr.

Further, fractionation studies on rat liver had shown the presence of prohibitin on the mitochondria, suggesting that it has a mitochondrial function in mammalian systems as well (30Santamaria E. Avila M.A. Latasa M.U. Rubio A. Martin-Duce A. Lu S.C. Mato J.M. Corrales F.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 3065-3070Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 31Matsuyama S. Kubo K.

Indeed, our earlier studies have shown that, although prohibitin is predominantly nuclear in human breast cancer cell lines like MCF-7 and T47D, it translocates to the cytoplasmic compartment upon camptothecin treatment and shows mitochondrial localization (26Fusaro G. Dasgupta P. Rastogi S. Joshi B. Chellappan S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 47853-47861Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). The translocation of prohibitin to the mitochondria occurred with a simultaneous translocation of the p53 protein; indeed, p53 has been shown to translocate to the mitochondria in response to apoptotic signals (33Chipuk J.E. Green D.R. Cell Cycle. 2004; 3: 429-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (1) Google Scholar, 34Mihara M. Erster S. Zaika A. Petrenko O. Chittenden T. Pancoska P. Moll U.M. Mol.

Biol. 2001; 21: 8521-8532Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). These studies show that prohibitin has both nuclear and mitochondrial functions, and the shuttling of prohibitin between nucleus and the mitochondria is probably a vital element in the regulation of cellular functions. The appropriate distribution of proteins between the nucleus and cytoplasm is maintained by a dynamic balance between nuclear import and nuclear export, mediated through nuclear pore complexes (37Fahrenkrog B. Aebi U. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 4: 757-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). Active nuclear export of proteins is mediated by short amino acid stretches termed nuclear export signals (NESs) (38Pemberton L.F. Paschal B.M. Traffic. 2005; 6: 187-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (560) Google Scholar, 39Yoneda Y. Hieda M. Nagoshi E. Miyamoto Y. Cell Struct. Funct. 1999; 24: 425-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The NESs identified to date are rich in hydrophobic amino acids such as leucine or isoleucine, and the leucine residues are critical for their activity (38Pemberton L.F. Paschal B.M. Traffic. 2005; 6: 187-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (560) Google Scholar, 40Bednenko J. Cingolani G. Gerace L. Traffic. 2003; 4: 127-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Leucine-rich NES containing proteins form a ternary complex with CRM-1/exportin 1 in conjunction with the GTP-bound form of Ran in the nucleus and exported as trimeric complex to the cytoplasm (39Yoneda Y. Hieda M. Nagoshi E. Miyamoto Y. Cell Struct. Funct. 1999; 24: 425-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 41Fornerod M. Ohno M. Yoshida M. Mattaj I.W.

In the present study, we demonstrate that prohibitin undergoes nuclear export upon camptothecin treatment mainly in cancer cells; normal cell lines appear to be resistant to this effect of camptothecin. Although the translocation of prohibitin occurred simultaneously with that of p53, prohibitin could translocate to the cytoplasmic compartment independent of p53. Furthermore, the export of prohibitin was inhibited by leptomycin B, which is an inhibitor of CRM-1-mediated export suggesting involvement of this member of importin-β family. This observation led to the identification of a putative NES in prohibitin, and deletion of this hydrophobic amino acid stretch caused inhibition of camptothecin-mediated export. Interestingly, cell lines that did not show the translocation of prohibitin were refractory to the apoptotic effects of camptothecin. Inhibition of the binding of prohibitin to CRM-1 by a peptide prevented the export of prohibitin and negatively impacted apoptosis. These results suggest that the nuclear export of prohibitin contributes to its multiple cellular functions. Cell Lines, Plasmids, and Transfections—Breast carcinoma cell lines MCF-7, T47D, and MDA-MB231, human primary fibroblast cell line HSF8, human embryonic lung fibroblast cell line WI-38, p53 negative osteosarcoma cell line Saos-2, and human non-small cell lung cancer cell line H1299 were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Immortalized but non-tumorigenic human breast epithelial cell line MCF-10A was cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F12K containing 5% horse serum, insulin, EGF, Cholera toxin, and hydrocortisone. SV40-transformed human lung fibroblast WI-38-VA13 was obtained from ATCC and cultured in Minimal essential medium eagle with Earle's salt and l-glutamine containing 10% fetal bovine serum, sodium pyruvate, and non-essential amino acids. Human aortic endothelial cells were grown in EGM bullet kit medium containing 5% fetal bovine serum from Clonetics. A forward primer carrying a MluI site and a reverse primer carrying EcoRI were used for preparing full-length Myc-tagged Phb by PCR; the fragment was subcloned into pBS-Myc-Mum1. N-terminal Myc-tagged prohibitin was released by EcoRI digestion and subcloned into the pCDNA3 mammalian expression vector. This plasmid was called Myc-Phb and was used for transient transfection experiments. To prepare NES-deleted Myc-tagged prohibitin (1-243), a reverse primer carrying termination codon was designed, and PCR was performed using T7 primer with Myc-phb as a template. PCR product was subcloned into pCDNA3 and named Myc-Phb-ΔNES. GFP-NES was prepared by a PCR-based overlap extension protocol. Appropriate primer sets were designed, and full-length GFP-NES was prepared, TA-cloned, and subcloned back into pCMS-EGFP, a commercially available vector from Clontech Laboratories. Fusion between the NES of prohibitin and GFP as well as the integrity of GFP sequence was verified by sequencing prior to use in transient transfection experiments. Transient transfections were performed with Lipofectamine reagent (Invitrogen) using 1 μg of DNA for each construct on MCF-7 cells cultured in 8-well chamber slides. Primer sequences are as follows: Phb-MluI-F (5′-TCA GTA ACG CGT ATG GCT GCC AAA GTG TT-3′), Phb-243-R (5′-TTA AGC TTC CAG CTT TCG CAG-3′), Phb-NES-F (5′-TAC AAG GCT GCT GAG GAC ATT GCT-3′), Phb-NES-R (5′-TGA TCA TTA CTG GGG GAG CTG GAG GAG CAC-3′), GFP-NES-F (5′-CTT GCC ACA ACC CGG GAT CCA C-3′), and GFP-NES-R (5′-CTC AGC AGC CTT GTA CAG CTC GTC CAT-3′). Drug Treatment, Antibodies, and Immunostaining—The prohibitin monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies were purchased from NeoMarkers, Inc. (Freemont, CA). The p53 polyclonal, CRM-1 polyclonal, Myc tag polyclonal, and hemagglutinin tag monoclonal antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Cells were plated onto poly-d-lysine (Sigma) coated 8-well glass chamber slides (10,000 cells per well) for immunostaining. Cells were either untreated or treated with either 30 μm camptothecin or the dose mentioned for 4 h (Sigma) in the presence or absence of 10 ng/ml leptomycin B. Cells were fixed in 3.5% paraformaldehyde for 25 min, permeabilized in 0.2% Triton X-100/phosphate-buffered saline for 5 min, and blocked in 5% normal goat serum in phosphate-buffered saline at room temperature for 1 h. Primary antibody incubations were performed overnight at 4 °C. After washing, secondary antibody incubation was performed with goat antimouse IgG Alexa Fluor-488 (green) and goat anti-rabbit IgG Alexa Fluor-546 (red) for 30 min at room temperature. DNA was labeled with Hoechst staining at a final concentration of 0.0025 mg/ml. Cells were visualized with a Zeiss LSM 510 (Zeiss, Thornwood, NY) confocal microscope, and areas of co-localization were determined using LSM 510 software (Zeiss). TUNEL Staining—MCF-7, MCF-10A, WI-38, and WI-38-VA13 cells were plated onto poly-d-lysine (Sigma) coated 8-well glass chamber slides (10,000 cells per well). The cells were either treated with varying concentrations of camptothecin, namely 15, 30, 60, and 120 μm, for 4 h or the cells were treated with 30 μm camptothecin for varying durations (2, 4, 8, or 16 h). The cells were fixed and stained according to manufacturer's instructions using Promega's DeadEnd Colorimetric TUNEL system. Immunoprecipitation and Immunoblotting—Cell lysates (50-200 μg) were treated with 1 μg of the appropriate primary antibody in a volume of 100 μl at 4 °C for 1 h. A 3-mg aliquot of protein G-Sepharose in a 100-μl volume was added to each sample and incubated for an additional hour. The binding was performed in a buffer containing 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 40 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EGTA, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm NaF, 0.1 mm Na3VO4, 0.5% Non-idet P-40, and 3 mg of bovine serum albumin per ml. The beads were washed six times with 600 μl of the same buffer, boiled in 20 μl of SDS sample buffer, and separated on 8 or 10% polyacrylamide gels. After semi-dry transfer to supported nitrocellulose membranes, the blots were probed with the appropriate antibody. The proteins were detected by using an enhanced chemiluminescence assay system from Amersham Biosciences. Delivery of Prohibitin NES to Cells—A peptide of the sequence ITYLPAGQSVLLQL corresponding to the NES of prohibitin was synthesized with a cysteine residue added at the C terminus for coupling to the carrier molecule, penetratin (44Derossi D. Joliot A.H. Chassaing G. Prochiantz A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10444-10450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). 10 mm Phb-NES peptide was conjugated to 1 mm penetratin (QBiogene) in the presence of 10 mm tris-(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine as described previously (44Derossi D. Joliot A.H. Chassaing G. Prochiantz A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10444-10450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The final conjugate was diluted to 150 μm and aliquoted and stored in -80 °C until further use. For competition assay, MCF-7 cells were plated on chamber slides as described earlier. The cells were treated with camptothecin (30 μm) for 4 h either in the presence of 10 μm Phb-NES peptide or a control peptide of the sequence FSGKNGFIC. A double immunofluorescence experiment was performed for prohibitin and p53 using monoclonal antibody for prohibitin and polyclonal antibody for p53. Secondary antibody incubation was performed with goat anti-mouse IgG Alexa Fluor-488 (green) and goat anti-rabbit IgG Alexa Fluor-546 (red) and after mounting cells, slide was observed by fluorescence microscopy using Leica DM LB2 microscope (40×/0.75 numerical aperture) with a Qimaging Retiga1300 camera. Subcellular Localization of Prohibitin and p53 Changes Preferentially upon Camptothecin Treatment—We had observed earlier that the subcellular localization of prohibitin and p53 changes in breast cancer cells upon treatment with camptothecin (26Fusaro G. Dasgupta P. Rastogi S. Joshi B. Chellappan S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 47853-47861Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). A double immunofluorescence experiment was conducted to examine whether this event was specific to camptothecin, or the translocation occurred when the cells were treated with other apoptotic agents as well. Human breast carcinoma cell lines MCF-7 and T47D were immunostained with a monoclonal antibody against prohibitin, and its presence was detected by secondary antibody labeled with Alexafluor-488, a green fluorochrome. At the same time, p53 was detected using a polyclonal antibody and a secondary antibody labeled with Alexafluor-546, a red fluorochrome. Cells were visualized by confocal microscopy. As shown in Fig. 1A, The majority of prohibitin (left panel) and p53 (middle panel) were found to be localized in the nucleus of MCF-7 cells; both the proteins were found to co-localize (right panel), indicating a physical interaction. As seen earlier, treatment of the cells with 30 μm camptothecin for 4 h led to the translocation of both proteins to the cytoplasmic compartment. Similar results were also obtained in T47D cells (Fig. 1B). Both the cell lines were also treated for 4 h with different apoptotic agents like tamoxifen (10 μm), which is a competitive antagonist for estrogen receptor; taxol (10 nm), which is a microtubule inhibitor; 5-fluorouracil (10 nm), an analog of uracil and thymine; doxorubicin (2 nm), which is a DNA-intercalating drug; etoposide (30 μm), a topoisomerase II inhibitor; and cisplatin (20 μm), which is a DNA cross-linker. As shown in Fig. 1, the apoptotic agents other than camptothecin were unable to induce the translocation of prohibitin and p53 to cytoplasm in either cell line. We conclude that the observed nuclear export of these proteins is a phenomenon associated with apoptosis induced by the topoisomerase 1 inhibitor, camptothecin. Nuclear Export of Prohibitin and p53 Does Not Occur in Untransformed Cells—The observation that prohibitin and p53 translocates to the cytoplasm in response to camptothecin was made in breast cancer cell lines. Experiments were designed to examine whether such an event took place in untransformed, immortalized cells as well as cultured primary human cells. Untransformed human diploid fibroblast cell lines, WI-38 and HSF8 (Fig. 2, A and B), untransformed mammary epithelial cell line MCF-10A (Fig. 2C), or cultured primary human aortic endothelial cells (HAECs, Fig. 2D) were treated with 30 μm camptothecin as described earlier, and the subcellular localization of prohibitin and p53 was ascertained by double immunofluorescence. As seen in Fig. 2, prohibitin and p53 were found to be co-localized in the nucleus in all the four primary cell lines. Interestingly, they did not translocate to the cytoplasm upon camptothecin treatment, as in several transformed cell lines (Figs. 1 and 4 and data not shown). This experiment suggests that the nuclear exit of prohibitin and p53 is an event that takes place preferentially in transformed cell lines derived from human cancer.FIGURE 4Nuclear export of prohibitin in transformed and primary cell lines correlates with susceptibility to apoptosis. A, MCF-7, MCF10A, WI-38, andWI-38-VA13 cells treated with camptothecin (30 μm) for 4 h, immunostained with an anti-prohibitin monoclonal antibody and an anti-p53 polyclonal antibody, and visualized by confocal microscopy.

Western blot for actin is shown as a loading control.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Apoptotic Response to Camptothecin Is Distinctive in Transformed and Untransformed Cell Lines—The apoptotic response to camptothecin treatment at different concentrations as well as for different durations was evaluated by TUNEL staining in the untransformed human diploid fibroblast cell line WI-38 and a WI-38 cell line transformed with SV40 large T-antigen (WI-38-VA13). Similarly, we compared the TUNEL staining in the breast epithelial MCF-10A cells and MCF-7 cells derived from breast cancer. The untransformed cell lines showed significant resistance to apoptosis when the duration of treatment with 30 μm camptothecin was extended to 16 h, as determined by TUNEL staining (Fig. 3A). Similarly, WI-38 and MCF-10A cell lines showed remarkably less TUNEL-positive cells in comparison to the transformed cell lines WI-38-VA13 and MCF-7 at all the treatment doses of camptothecin (Fig. 3B). These results suggest the inherent differences in the transformed and untransformed cell lines to camptothecin induced apoptosis. Because a dose of 30 μm camptothecin and treatment duration of 4 h led to 40-60% TUNEL-positive cells, we chose these conditions for our further experiments. Nuclear Export of Prohibitin and p53 in Transformed Cell Lines Correlates with Increased Apoptosis—The finding that prohibitin and p53 translocation occurs preferentially in transformed cells was further verified by using two pairs of closely related cell lines. MCF-10A is derived from normal mammary epithelial cells, whereas MCF-7 is derived from breast cancer. Similarly, we obtained a version of the WI-38 cell line that was transformed with SV40 large T-antigen (WI-38-VA13). Prohibitin and p53 were predominantly found in the nucleus of all the four cell lines. As shown in Fig. 4A, camptothecin treatment led to the nuclear export of prohibitin and p53 in the transformed MCF-7 cells as well as the WI-38-VA13 cells but not the normal MCF-10A or WI-38 cells. It thus appears that cellular transformation correlates with the nuclear export of prohibitin and p53. Attempts were then made to examine whether the changes in the localization of prohibitin and p53 correlated with induction of apoptosis by camptothecin. Toward this purpose, PARP cleavage, a measure of caspase activity, was assessed by Western blotting (45Duriez P.J. Shah G.M. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1997; 75: 337-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar) of lysates from MCF-7, MCF-10A, WI-38, and WI-38-VA13 cells treated with camptothecin for different periods (Fig. 4B). MCF-7 and WI-38-VA13 cells, which showed the nuclear export of prohibitin and p53, show significant amounts of PARP cleavage at 4 and 8 h after camptothecin treatment, as judged by the appearance of a lower 86-kDa band. At the same time, untransformed cell lines MCF-10A and WI-38 did not show cleavage of PARP suggesting that the translocation of p53 and prohibitin to the cytoplasm contributes to apoptosis induced by camptothecin. Nuclear Export of Prohibitin Does Not Require Functional p53—Our previous studies have shown that prohibitin co-localizes with p53 in the nucleus of breast cancer cell lines and treatment with camptothecin caused both the proteins to translocate to the cytoplasmic compartment and localize to the mitochondria. Studies from several other laboratories had shown that p53 translocates to the mitochondria in response to camptothecin (46Joseph T.W. Zaika A. Moll U.M.

https://openalex.org/W2057165036,"Defective L-type Ca2+ channel (I(CaL)) regulation is one major cause for contractile dysfunction in the heart. The I(CaL) is enhanced by sympathetic nervous stimulation: via the activation of beta-adrenergic receptors, PKA phosphorylates the alpha1C(Ca(V)1.2)- and beta2-channel subunits and ahnak, an associated 5643-amino acid (aa) protein. In this study, we examined the role of a naturally occurring, genetic variant Ile5236Thr-ahnak on I(CaL). Binding experiments with ahnak fragments (wild-type, Ile5236Thr mutated) and patch clamp recordings revealed that Ile5236Thr-ahnak critically affected both beta2 subunit interaction and I(CaL) regulation. Binding affinity between ahnak-C1 (aa 4646-5288) and beta2 subunit decreased by approximately 50% after PKA phosphorylation or in the presence of Ile5236Thr-ahnak peptide. On native cardiomyocytes, intracellular application of this mutated ahnak peptide mimicked the PKA-effects on I(CaL) increasing the amplitude by approximately 60% and slowing its inactivation together with a leftward shift of its voltage dependency. Both mutated Ile5236Thr-peptide and Ile5236Thr-fragment (aa 5215-5288) prevented specifically the further up-regulation of I(CaL) by isoprenaline. Hence, we suggest the ahnak-C1 domain serves as physiological brake on I(CaL). Relief from this inhibition is proposed as common pathway used by sympathetic signaling and Ile5236Thr-ahnak fragments to increase I(CaL). This genetic ahnak variant might cause individual differences in I(CaL) regulation upon physiological challenges or therapeutic interventions."
https://openalex.org/W2018816835,"2-Thioribothymidine (s2T) is a modified nucleoside of U, specifically found at position 54 of tRNAs from extreme thermophilic microorganisms. The function of the 2-thiocarbonyl group of s2T54 is thermostabilization of the three-dimensional structure of tRNA; however, its biosynthesis has not been clarified until now. Using an in vivo tRNA labeling experiment, we demonstrate that the sulfur atom of s2T in tRNA is derived from cysteine or sulfate. We attempted to reconstitute 2-thiolation of s2T in vitro, using a cell extract of Thermus thermophilus. Specific 2-thiolation of ribothymidine, at position 54, was observed in vitro, in the presence of ATP. Using this assay, we found a strong temperature dependence of the 2-thiolation reaction in vitro as well as expression of 2-thiolation enzymes in vivo. These results suggest that the variable content of s2T in vivo at different temperatures may be explained by the above characteristics of the enzymes responsible for the 2-thiolation reaction. Furthermore, we found that another posttranscriptionally modified nucleoside, 1-methyladenosine at position 58, is required for the efficient 2-thiolation of ribothymidine 54 both in vivo and in vitro. 2-Thioribothymidine (s2T) is a modified nucleoside of U, specifically found at position 54 of tRNAs from extreme thermophilic microorganisms.

Post-transcriptional modification is a characteristic feature of RNA molecules. In transfer RNA, post-transcriptional modification plays various roles that are required for the translation process, including fidelity control of codon recognition, reading frame maintenance, and stabilization of the tertiary tRNA structure (1Curran J.F. Grosjean H. Benne R. Modification and Editing of RNA. American Society for Microbiology Press, Washington, D.

Oshima T. Saneyoshi M. Nishimura S. FEBS Lett. 1974; 43: 59-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), and has been shown to stabilize tRNA structure in a high temperature environment (3Yokoyama S. Watanabe K. Miyazawa T. Adv.

Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 7869-7876Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar), the 2-thiolation level of rT54 in tRNA increases with cultivation temperature; the melting temperature (Tm) of the tRNA increases concomitantly with incremental increases in s2T content. These findings indicate that 2-thiolation of rT54 is responsible for the thermostability of thermophile tRNA at a variety of cultivation temperatures, thereby ensuring the adaptation of the protein synthesis machinery to specific thermal environments. However, the body of knowledge regarding s2T biosynthesis is limited. First, the enzymes responsible for the tRNA modification and the genes involved in the 2-thiolation reaction have not been identified to date. Previously, we demonstrated that the tRNA structural elements required for 2-thiolation are the conserved bases in the TψC loop and the structure created by those bases (6Shigi N. Suzuki T.

We also examined the 2-thiolation reaction in vitro, in order to characterize the temperature dependence of this reaction, and considered the contribution of neighboring nucleoside modifications to the efficiency of 2-thiolation of rT54, both in vivo and in vitro. Strains and Media—T. thermophilus HB8 was used as the wild-type strain throughout this study. Escherichia coli JM109 was used as the bacterial host for the genetic manipulation of plasmids. Other strains used in this study are listed in Table 1. Rich medium and minimal medium (MM) for T. thermophilus were used as described previously (9Takada T. Akanuma S. Kotsuka T. Tamakoshi M. Yamagishi A. Oshima T. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1993; 59: 2737-2739Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Both wild-type and mutant cells were cultivated in the rich medium without or with 30 μg/ml kanamycin, respectively, unless otherwise stated. For in vivo labeling of RNA, minimal medium without sulfur compounds (MM–S) was prepared. The salts used had chloride ions (Cl–) substituted for sulfate ions (SO2–4) as follows: (NH4)2SO4 to NH4Cl, ZnSO4-7H2O to ZnCl2, CuSO4-5H2O to CuCl2, and FeSO4-7H2O to FeCl3-6H2O. VOSO4-xH2O, biotin, and thiamine-HCl were not used as supplements in MM–S medium.TABLE 1Bacterial strains used in this studyStrainsRelevant characteristicsReference or sourceT. thermophilusHB8Wild typeRef. 7Oshima T.

Takeyoshi (unpublished) Open table in a new tab In Vivo Labeling of RNA—Cells were cultivated overnight in 10 ml of MM at 70 °C, centrifuged, and washed with MM–S medium. They were then incubated with shaking at 70 °C for 1 h in 10 ml of MM-S supplemented with 0.27 mCi of [35S]methionine, 0.41 mm cysteine, and 0.4 mm sodium sulfate for the methionine labeling; 0.27 mCi of [35S]cysteine, 0.33 mm methionine, and 0.4 mm sodium sulfate for the cysteine labeling; and 0.27 mCi of [35S]sodium sulfate, 0.33 mm methionine, and 0.41 mm cysteine for the sulfate labeling. 35S-Labeled compounds were purchased from American Radiolabeled Chemicals. Total RNA was extracted from the cells using ISOGEN (Wako). For alkaline treatment of tRNA, total RNA was incubated at 37 °C for 1 h in 100 mm HEPES-KOH (pH 9.0). Then total RNA was separated by 10% PAGE containing 7 m urea, and the gel was dried and exposed to an imaging plate, followed by analysis using a BAS5000 bioimaging analyzer (Fuji Photo Systems). 35S-Labeled Nucleoside Analysis by High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC)—35S-Labeled RNA was digested by Nuclease P1 (Yamasa) and bacterial alkaline phosphatase (Takara) in 20 mm HEPES-KOH (pH 7.5) for 10 h at 37 °C. The hydrolysate of RNA was analyzed by an l-7100 liquid chromatography system (Hitachi) with an ODS reversed-phased column (Inertsil ODS-3, 2.1 × 250 mm; GL Science), using the solvent system described previously (10Kaneko T. Suzuki T. Kapushoc S.T. Rubio M.A. Ghazvini J. Watanabe K. Simpson L. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 657-667Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Eluted fractions were collected every 30 s, UV absorbance at 254 nm was measured, and the radioactivity of each fraction was measured using an LSC6100 liquid scintillation counter (Aloka). Authentic 4-thiouridine (s4U) was purchased from Sigma. Authentic s2T was purified from the hydrolysate of total tRNA from T. thermophilus as described above, using a preparative column (Inertsil ODS-3, 10 × 250 mm; GL Science), and the molecular weight and UV spectra were confirmed using a mass spectrometer, LCQ-DUO (ThermoFinnigan), and a spectrometer, Gene Spec III (Hitachi), respectively. Construction of thiI, iscS, sufS, and trmI Mutant Strains—The target genes of T. thermophilus HB8 were disrupted by the insertion or the replacement of the highly thermostable kanamycin nucleotidyltransferase (htk) gene (11Hoseki J. Yano T. Koyama Y. Kuramitsu S. Kagamiyama H. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1999; 126: 951-956Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). To identify the candidate open reading frames, we made use of genome sequence data provided by the genome sequencing project of T. thermophilus HB8, which was in progress in Japan (now available on NCBI as an accession number of NC_006461). To obtain the thiI::km insertion strain (NS0801), we cloned an ∼3.2-kb region containing the thiI gene (TTHA1796) and flanking regions into a pT7Blue vector (Novagene), and the htk gene cassette was ligated into the NcoI site, located at the 16th amino acid of the thiI open reading frame. The htk gene cassette was amplified from pUC18-pJHK3 (11Hoseki J. Yano T. Koyama Y. Kuramitsu S. Kagamiyama H. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1999; 126: 951-956Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar) using primers containing NcoI sites. Pairs of oligonucleotide DNAs used are as follows: thiI-F/thiI-R and htk-NcoI-F/htk-NcoI-R. The sequences of oligonucleotide DNAs used in gene disruptions are listed in Table 2. For the iscS::km insertion strain (NS0821), we cloned a 1.6-kb region that included the iscS gene (TTHA0456) and flanking regions. The htk gene cassette was ligated into the BlnI site, located at the 122nd amino acid. Pairs of oligonucleotide DNAs used are as follows: iscS-F/iscS-R and htk-BlnI-F/htk-BlnI-R. To construct the sufS::km insertion strain (NS0822), we used a linear DNA fragment constructed using the PCR ligation. The 5′- and 3′-regions (0.5 kb) of sufS (TTHA1735) were amplified from the genome by PCR, and the htk cassette was amplified from pUC18-pJHK3 (11Hoseki J. Yano T. Koyama Y. Kuramitsu S. Kagamiyama H. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1999; 126: 951-956Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). The fragments had complementary sequence enabling the 5′-region, htk, and the 3′-region to be ligated by PCR. Pairs of oligonucleotide DNAs used are as follows: sufS-5′-F/sufS-5′-R, sufS-3′-F/sufS-3′-R, and sufS-htk-F/sufS-htk-R. To construct the trmI (TTHA0609) deletion strain (NS0802), we used a linear DNA fragment constructed by PCR ligation as above. For deletion of trmI, the 5′- and 3′-flanking regions of trmI were amplified, respectively. Pairs of oligonucleotide DNAs used are as follows: trmI-5′-F/trmI-5′-R, trmI-3′-F/trmI-3′-R, and trmI-htk-F/trmI-htk-R.TABLE 2Oligonucleotide DNAs used in gene disruptions in this studyPrimersSequencesAmplification regionsFor NS0801thil-F5′-ctttcgccgc ggtggggtct-3′thiI and flanking regionsthiI-R5′-ctcccgctcg gccacggcgt-3′thiI and flanking regionshtk-Ncol-F5′-atcgaCCATG Ggttgacggc ggatatggta c-3′htkhtk-Ncol-R5′-ttagcCCAT GGgttgacgt aaccaacatg attaac-3′htkFor NS0802trmI-5′-F5′-ccgaggtgctggagctcatc-3′5′-flanking region (0.8 kb) of trmItrmI-5′-R5′-gtaccatatc cgccgtcaac ctcgggaggc ctaaagggcc-3′5′-flanking region (0.8 kb) of trmItrmI-3′-F5′-gttaatcatg ttggttacgc ccacgccgtc ttgcgggagc-3′3′-flanking region (0.5 kb) of trmItrmI-3′-R5′-gggaggaggt cttcctcggc-3′3′-flanking region (0.5 kb) of trmItrmI-htk-F5′-ggccctttag gcctcccgag gttgacggcg gatatggtac-3′htkhtktrmI-htk-R5′-gctcccgcaa gacggcgtgg gcgtaaccaa catgattaac-3′htkFor NS0821iscS-F5′-tgcccctgaa ggaggtggcc-3′iscS and flanking regionsiscS-R5′-cttccgttcc gctcgggccc-3′iscS and flanking regionshtk-BlnI-F5′-atcgaCCTAG Gttgacggcg gatatggtac-3′htkhtk-BlnI-R5′-ttagcCCTAG Gttgacgtaa ccaacatgat taac-3′htkFor NS0822sufS-5′-F5′-taagcgccct gagggaggac-3′5′ region (0.5 kb) of sufSsufS-5′-R5′-gtaccatatc cgccgtcaac ggtggaccag ggagaccacc c-3′5′ region (0.5 kb) of sufSsufS-3′-F5′-gttaatcatg ttggttacgc ttgggggcgg tacgaggtcc-3′3′ region (0.5 kb) of sufSsufS-3′-R5′-caggcccggt acttggcctc-3′3′ region (0.5 kb) of sufSsufS-htk-F5′-gggtggtctc cctggtccac cgttgacggc ggatatggta c-3′htksufS-htk-R5′-ggacctcgta ccgcccccaa gcgtaaccaa catgattaac-3′htk Open table in a new tab Using the plasmids and fragments prepared as described above, T. thermophilus HB8 was transformed according to the literature (12Koyama Y. Hoshino T. Tomizuka N. Furukawa K. J. Bacteriol. 1986; 166: 338-340Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and then selected on a rich plate containing 300 μg/ml kanamycin at 70 °C. Site-specific homologous recombination of transformants was confirmed by PCR amplification, followed by restriction enzyme digestion or Southern hybridization. Modified Base Analysis of Total tRNA by LC/MS—Cells were cultivated at 70 °C up to late log phase. Total RNAs were extracted from cells using Isogen (Wako), and the tRNA fraction was further purified by 10% PAGE containing 7 m urea. Nucleoside analysis of total tRNA was performed by LC/MS as described previously (10Kaneko T. Suzuki T. Kapushoc S.T. Rubio M.A. Ghazvini J. Watanabe K. Simpson L. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 657-667Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). The s2T content was calculated from the area under the UV peak and normalized by the peak of pseudouridine (ψ) in each data set. In Vitro Thiolation Assay—s4U-deficient tRNAfMet (Kenjo Miyauchi, University of Tokyo) was prepared from the E. coli JD20605 strain (Dr. Miki Takeyoshi, Fukuoka Dental College). tRNAPhe from Saccharomyces cerevisiae was purchased from Sigma. tRNAfMet with 1-methyladenosine (m1A) 58 was prepared by recombinant T. thermophilus TrmI protein, which was expressed in the E. coli strain Rosetta (DE3) (Novagen), with plasmid pML24, and purified as described previously (13Droogmans L. Roovers M. Bujnicki J.M. Tricot C. Hartsch T. Stalon V. Grosjean H. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 2148-2156Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). tRNAfMet from the E. coli thiI mutant (8 μg) was methylated at 60 °C for 1 h in a reaction mixture containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 10 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 50 μm S-adenosylmethionine (Sigma), and 2 μg of TrmI. The reaction was stopped by phenol extraction, and the tRNA was ethanol-precipitated. Unmodified tRNAfMet (with a C1G mutation) and tRNAfMet (with C1G/U54A mutations) were prepared by in vitro transcription using T7 RNA polymerase (14Milligan J.F. Uhlenbeck O.C. Methods Enzymol. 1989; 180: 51-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (1022) Google Scholar). Template for in vitro transcription was constructed by PCR using synthetic oligonucleotide DNAs carrying the tRNA gene under the T7 promoter sequence (14Milligan J.F. Uhlenbeck O.C. Methods Enzymol. 1989; 180: 51-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (1022) Google Scholar). Oligonucleotide DNAs used for the construction of a plasmid-bearing gene for tRNAfMet are fMet-C1G-F (ggccGAATTC taatacgact cactataggc ggggtggagc agcctggtag ctcgtcgggc tcataacccg aagg) and fMet-C1G-R (cgcgcAAGCT Tggatggaag acctggttgc gggggccgga tttgaaccgg cgaccttcgg gttatgag). The PCR products were cloned into the EcoRI and HindIII sites of pUC19. For in vitro transcription, the pair of primers fMet-F (taatacgact cactataggc)/fMet-R (ttgcgggggc cggatttgaa c) or fMet-F/fMet-U54A-R (ttgcgggggc cggatttgaT ccggcgacct tc) was employed to PCR-amplify the template plasmid pUC19-tRNAfMetC1G, respectively. Transcripts of tRNA genes were prepared at 37 °C for 3 h in a reaction mixture containing 40 mm HEPES-KOH (pH 7.8), 5 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm spermidine, 8 mm MgCl2, 1 mm each NTPs, 5 mm GMP, 50 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 2 μg/ml template DNA, and T7 RNA polymerase (14Milligan J.F. Uhlenbeck O.C. Methods Enzymol. 1989; 180: 51-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (1022) Google Scholar). Then the reaction for CCA addition was performed as described (15Tomari Y. Suzuki T. Watanabe K. Ueda T. Genes Cells. 2000; 5: 689-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). tRNAs were dephosphorylated using bacterial alkaline phosphatase (Takara) and labeled at their 5′ termini with [γ-32P]ATP (110 TBq/mmol, Amersham Biosciences) and T4 polynucleotide kinase (Toyobo) and purified using denaturing 10% PAGE. Cell extract used for the in vitro assay was prepared from early log phase cells that had been cultivated at either 80 or 50 °C. Cells were resuspended with standard buffer containing 50 mm HEPES-KOH (pH 7.6), 100 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, and 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Resuspended cells were sonicated at 4 °C and then centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. The supernatant (S20) was used as “lysate.” Additionally, we performed a 100,000 × g centrifugation (S100) followed by gel filtration of the supernatant with a Nap5 column (Amersham Biosciences), to prepare the lysate for the m1A dependence assay (Fig. 5C). Standard reactions were performed with 5′-labeled tRNA (30,000–50,000 cpm), 5 mm ATP, and lysate (10–15 mg/ml) in 20 μl of standard buffer at 50 °C for 20 min, unless otherwise indicated. tRNA was recovered using Isogen (Wako), precipitated with ethanol, and then electrophoresed on [(N-acryloylamino)phenyl]mercuric chloride (APM) gels, which contained 100 μm APM as described previously (6Shigi N. Suzuki T. Tamakoshi M. Oshima T. Watanabe K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 39128-39135Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 16Igloi G.L. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 3842-3849Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). These were exposed to an imaging plate, followed by analysis using a BAS5000 bioimaging analyzer (Fuji Photo Systems). RNA Sequencing with APM—RNA sequencing (17Donis-Keller H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1980; 8: 3133-3142Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar) was performed as described previously (6Shigi N. Suzuki T. Tamakoshi M. Oshima T. Watanabe K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 39128-39135Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). RNA sequencing with APM was performed using standard methods, except for gels containing 100 μm APM. Quantification of the tRNAIle Thiolation Level—The tRNAIle in total RNA was specifically labeled with [α-32P]dCTP using splint labeling (18Hausner T.P. Giglio L.M. Weiner A.M. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 2146-2156Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 19Schneider A. McNally K.P. Agabian N. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 3699-3705Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Total RNA was heat-denatured and annealed with the oligonucleotide probe SP1 (complementary to region 59–76, with one dG overhanging: 5′-GTGGTGGGCGATGGTGGAC-3′) and a destabilizing probe DS1 (complementary to the D stem-loop: 5′-TAACCAGCTGAGCTAA-3′) in a splint buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 50 mm NaCl and 1 mm dithiothreitol) and then incubated with T7 Sequenase (Amersham Biosciences) and [α-32P]dCTP (110 TBq/mmol; Amersham Biosciences) at 37 °C for 30 min. The labeled tRNAIle was purified by 10% PAGE-containing 7 m urea, followed by limited digestion with RNase T1 (Sigma). Limited digestion was performed by incubation in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), containing 100 mm MgCl2 for 30 min at 4 °C. The resulting 3′-fragment was purified further by 10% PAGE containing 7 m urea. The recovered tRNAIle 3′-fragments were analyzed by APM-PAGE. Temperature Sensitivity Assay—Cells were cultivated overnight at 70 °C. Cultures diluted to 10–2, 10–3, or 10–4 were spotted onto rich plates and incubated for 32 h at 70 or 80 °C, respectively. Transfer RNA Melting Analysis—Melting curves for tRNAs were measured in 50 mm sodium cacodylate buffer, pH 7.5, in the presence of 10 mm MgCl2 and 200 mm NaCl. tRNA hyperchromicities at 260 nm were recorded using a spectrophotometer, RESPONSE II (Gilford). Cysteine and Sulfate Ion Are the Sulfur Donors for s2T Biosynthesis in Vivo—To identify the sulfur donor for s2T modification, we performed an in vivo labeling experiment. It is known that cysteine is a sulfur donor for tRNA modifications, such as 4-thiouridine (s4U), 5-methylaminomethyl-2-thiouridine (mnm5s2U), 6-isopentenyl-2-methylthioadenosine (ms2i6A), and 2-thiocytidine (s2C), in E. coli (20Lauhon C.T. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 6820-6829Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Also in Salmonella typhimurium, cysteine is a sulfur donor for tRNA modi-fications as above, and instead of ms2i6A, tRNA contains 6-(4-hydroxyisopentenyl)-2-methylthioadenosine (ms2io6A) (21Nilsson K. Lundgren H.K. Hagervall T.G. Bjork G.R. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 6830-6835Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). In light of this knowledge, we tested the possibility that cysteine and other sulfur compounds are incorporated into the s2Tof T. thermophilus tRNA. T. thermophilus were cultivated for 1 h in minimal medium containing 35S-labeled methionine, cysteine, or sodium sulfate. Total RNA was extracted from the cells and analyzed by denaturing PAGE. A [35S]methionine-labeled band appeared in one tRNA species, and the band disappeared with mild alkaline treatment of the sample (Fig. 1A, lanes 1 and 2). This indicates that the band was probably derived from [35S]methionylated tRNAMet. When grown in the presence of labeled cysteine or sulfate ions, bands corresponding to all of the tRNA species were uniformly labeled with 35S and were unaffected by mild alkaline treatment (Fig. 1A, lanes 3–6). These bands are believed to be derived from tRNAs modified with 35S. T. thermophilus tRNAs possess s4U at position 8, one of the major sulfur-modified nucleosides together with s2T54 (4Watanabe K. Shinma M. Oshima T. Nishimura S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1976; 72: 1137-1144Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Therefore, labeled RNA was digested into nucleosides and analyzed by an ODS reversedphase column, in order to confirm that the sulfur atom of cysteine and the sulfate ion were actually incorporated into s2T. Two major 35S-labeled peaks were detected in the RNA hydrolysate (Fig. 1B). These were identified as s4U and s2T by comparing their elution times with those of authentic nucleosides. The chromatogram pattern was essentially the same for both [35S]sulfate and [35S]cysteine labeling (data not shown). These results clearly demonstrate that the sulfur atoms from cysteine and the sulfate ion were incorporated into the s2T of tRNA in vivo. iscS and sufS Mutations Did Not Affect s2T Biosynthesis in T. thermophilus—IscS (iron sulfur cluster) is the cysteine desulfurase that is responsible for all of the thio-modifications in E. coli (20Lauhon C.T. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 6820-6829Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) and S. typhimurium (21Nilsson K. Lundgren H.K. Hagervall T.G. Bjork G.R. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 6830-6835Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). This enzyme catalyzes the initial sulfur transfer reaction from cysteine. It is believed that, in T. thermophilus (see above), the sulfur atom from cysteine is also incorporated into s2T, so that an IscS homologue in T. thermophilus may be a candidate enzyme for s2T biosynthesis. A genomic data base search of T. thermophilus HB8 revealed that there are two putative cysteine desulfurase-encoding genes. Alignment of the deduced sequence of these enzymes with the sequence of E. coli IscS and SufS (named after the mobilization of sulfur), strongly suggests that the two cysteine desulfurase-like proteins of T. thermophilus are IscS and SufS homologues (data not shown). The difference between the two enzymes is indicated by the motif around a conserved catalytic cysteine; a consensus sequence (SSGSACTS) around Cys328 of E. coli IscS can effectively distinguish this enzyme from SufS, which has a consensus sequence of RXGHHCA (22Mihara H. Esaki N. Appl. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 2002; 60: 12-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). Both IscS and SufS are known to be involved in Fe-S cluster assembly, together with other components of the ISC and SUF machinery (23Takahashi Y. Tokumoto U. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 28380-28383Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar, 24Outten F.W. Djaman O. Storz G. Mol. Microbiol. 2004; 52: 861-872Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). However, only IscS (not SufS) is involved in tRNA thiolation in E. coli (20Lauhon C.T. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 6820-6829Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). We constructed two mutant strains of iscS or sufS by homologous recombination and confirmed the genomic organization around the target genes by Southern hybridization or PCR (data not shown). Formation of s2T in tRNA was not affected in these mutant strains, as determined by nucleoside analyses of total tRNA with reversed-phase HPLC, coupled with a mass spectrometer. s2T was detected as the protonated form (m/z = 275) and protonated free-base form (m/z = 143). The s2T contents of iscS and sufS mutants were 1.2 and 0.9, when compared with that of the wild type (set at 1), respectively. These results suggest redundant roles for IscS and SufS in the synthesis of s2T. However, it is possible that another cysteine-utilizing enzyme, distinct from IscS and SufS, is present in T. thermophilus. Detection of 2-Thiolation Activity in a T. thermophilus Cell Extract— To characterize the 2-thiouridylation reaction in detail, we tried to detect its activity in vitro. We used the affinity electrophoresis method (APM gel electrophoresis) developed originally by Igloi (16Igloi G.L. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 3842-3849Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar), since we have succeeded previously in the detection of the 2-thiolation of U54 using this method (6Shigi N. Suzuki T. Tamakoshi M. Oshima T. Watanabe K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 39128-39135Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). First, we used tRNAfMet from the E. coli thiI mutant strain as the substrate, since the nucleotide sequence of the tRNA is almost identical to that of tRNAfMet from T. thermophilus.At the unmodified nucleoside level, the differences are that the U50 of E. coli tRNA is C50 in T. thermophilus (25Sprinzl M. Vassilenko K.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 2005; 33: D139-D140Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2A (a and b)) and that the tRNA from the thiI mutant has no s4U (26Mueller E.G. Buck C.J. Palenchar P.M. Barnhart L.E. Paulson J.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 2606-2610Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). s4U is known to be retarded greatly in APM gels (16Igloi G.L. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 3842-3849Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). In addition, we constructed an s4U-deficient strain of T. thermophilus (thiI mutant). The gene thiI encodes a thiotransferase that is required for s4U8 synthesis in E. coli (26Mueller E.G. Buck C.J. Palenchar P.M. Barnhart L.E. Paulson J.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 2606-2610Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). We constructed a thiI mutant of T. thermophilus (NS0801), and tRNA recovered from the mutant cells was analyzed by LC/MS. The tRNA modification of NS0801 was the same as wild type, with the exception of the complete loss of s4U (data not shown). This indicates that thiI of T. thermophilus encodes a genuine thiotransferase for s4U8 synthesis. Using the s4U-deficient, native tRNAfMet from E. coli as the substrate, ATP-dependent 2-thiouridylation was detected, suggesting the formation of s2T (Fig. 2B (a)). When the wild-type lysate was used, migrating bands corresponding to both 4-thiouridylated tRNA (greatly retarded) and 2-thiouridylated tRNA (slightly retarded) were detected (lane 3), but only a single retarded band, corresponding to 2-thiouridylated tRNA, was detected when lysate from the mutant NS0801 was used (lane 5). To confirm that the 2-thiouridylation occurred at position 54 in the tRNA, we performed the same experiment using tRNA transcripts (Fig. 2A (c)), in which C1 was substituted by G1, to obtain more efficient transcription in vitro (14Milligan J.F. Uhlenbeck O.C. Methods Enzymol. 1989; 180: 51-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (1022) Google Scholar). The tRNAs recovered from the reaction mixture were analyzed using APM gel electrophoresis, by which 2- and 4-thiouridylations of tRNAfMet transcript of the U54A mutant were examined as compared with those of the wild type (Fig. 2B (b)). The wild-type tRNA transcript was thiolated at a slightly lower level than the native tRNAfMet (compare lane 5 in Fig. 2B, a and b), and this may be caused by the presence of other modified nucleosides in the native tRNA. The U54A mutant was effectively 4-thiouridylated (Fig. 2B (b), lane 8) but not 2-thiouridylated (Fig. 2B (b), lane 10), suggesting that 2-thiouridylation occurred at position 54.

Because many adjuvant therapies seek to induce glioma apoptosis, strategies that lower thresholds for the induction of apoptosis may improve patient outcomes. Therefore, elucidation of the biological mechanisms that underlie resistance to current therapies is needed to develop new therapeutic strategies. Here we proposed a novel mechanism of proapoptotic effect induced by a pharmacological peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ (PPARγ) agonist, troglitazone, that facilitates caspase signaling in human glioma cells. Troglitazone activates protein-tyrosine phosphatase (PTP)-1B, which subsequently reduces phosphotyrosine 705 STAT3 (pY705-STAT3) via a PPARγ-independent pathway. Reduction of pY705-STAT3 in glioma cells caused down-regulation of FLIP (FADD-like IL-1β-converting enzyme-inhibitory protein) and Bcl-2. Furthermore, troglitazone induced Ser-392 phosphorylation of p53 via a PPARγ-dependent pathway and up-regulation of Bax in a p53 wild-type glioma. When given with tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand or caspase-dependent chemotherapeutic agents, such as etoposide and paclitaxel, troglitazone exhibited a synergistic effect by facilitating caspase-8/9 activities. A PPARγ antagonist, GW9662, did not block this effect, although a PTP inhibitor abrogated it. Knockdown of STAT3 by STAT3-small interfering RNA negated the inhibitory effect of PTP inhibitor on troglitazone, indicating that troglitazone uses a STAT3 inactivation mechanism that makes caspase-8/9 activities susceptible to cytotoxic agents in glioma cells and that PTP1B plays a critical role in the down-regulation of activated STAT3, as well as FLIP and Bcl-2. When taken with caspase-dependent anti-neoplastic agents, troglitazone may be a promising drug for use against malignant gliomas because it facilitates the caspase cascade, thereby lowering thresholds for the apoptosis induction of glioma cells.

Malignant gliomas adopt the ability to bypass or disrupt fail-safe mechanisms, such as programmed cell death and host immune defense (1Chakravarti A. Zhai G.G. Zhang M. Malhotra R. Latham D.E.

Because many adjuvant therapies for malignant tumors seek to induce tumor cell apoptosis, strategies that lower thresholds for the induction of apoptosis, which can then make other treatments more effective, may improve patient outcomes. Therefore, further understanding of the biological anti-apoptotic mechanisms that govern resistance to conventional glioma therapies is required in order to develop safer and more effective treatments.

Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 1162-1170PubMed Google Scholar). It has been known that TRAIL triggers caspase cascade through interaction with TRAIL-responsive death receptors (DR), such as DR4 and DR5, which induce cleavage of caspace-8 in the Fas-associated death domain protein-dependent mechanism (6Thomas L.R. Henson A. Reed J.C. Salsbury F.R. Thorburn A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 32780-32785Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). In this pathway, cleaved caspase-8 plays a significant role as an initiator that can process other members in the caspase cascade. Cleaved caspase-8 induces cleavage of Bid, which up-regulates mitochondrial cytochrome c (Cyt-c) release (7Kuwana T. Smith J.J. Muzio M. Dixit V. Newmeyer D.D. Kornbluth S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16589-16594Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). Cyt-c then cooperates with apoptotic protease-activating factor-1 to activate caspase-9 (8Li P. Nijhawan D. Budihardjo I. Srinivasula S.M. Ahmad M. Alnemri E.S. Wang X. Cell. 1997; 91: 479-489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6239) Google Scholar). After these activations, both caspase-8 and -9 activate caspase-3, which is the primary activator of apoptotic DNA fragmentation and leads to cancer cell apoptosis (9Wolf B.B. Schuler M. Echeverri F.

Despite the numerous reports describing the favorable anti-tumor activities of TRAIL, malignant gliomas exhibit considerable heterogeneity in their sensitivity to TRAIL, even among those expressing DR4 and DR5 (5Hao C. Beguinot F. Condorelli G. Trencia A. Van Meir E.G. Yong V.W. Parney I.F. Roa W.H. Petruk K.C. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 1162-1170PubMed Google Scholar, 10Knight M.J. Riffkin C.D. Muscat A.M. Ashley D.M.

In this regard, it has been reported recently that several cancers, including gliomas, constitutively express FLIP (Fas-associated death domain-like IL-1β-converting enzyme-inhibitory protein) (11Yoon G.

Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 7086-7091Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar), which is a cytoplasmic protein that inhibits the recruitment and processing of caspase-8 (12Krueger A. Baumann S. Krammer P.H. Kirchhoff S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 8247-8254Crossref PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar), and that the overexpression of FLIP induces cancer's resistance to DR-dependent apoptosis (14Rippo M.R. Moretti S. Vescovi S. Tomasetti M. Orecchia S. Amici G. Catalano A. Procopio A. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 7753-7760Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). In addition, it has also been found that Bcl-2 family proteins modulate caspase-9 activity by controlling the permeability of mitochondrial membranes and that dysregulation of these proteins in cancer cells correlates with their anti-apoptotic potential and progression (15Reed J.C. Curr. Opin. Oncol. 1999; 11: 68-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). Specifically, the anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family, including Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL, stabilizes the mitochondrial porin channel (voltage-dependent anion channel) and inhibits Cyt-c release (16Shimizu S. Narita M. Tsujimoto Y. Nature. 1999; 399: 483-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (1919) Google Scholar), whereas the pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 family, including Bax and Bad, antagonizes this process by competitive heterodimerization with anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 proteins (17Adams J.M. Cory S. Science. 1998; 281: 1322-1326Crossref PubMed Scopus (4811) Google Scholar). Although down-regulation of FLIP and/or anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins are therefore a therapeutic target for promotion of caspase cascade activity, the mechanism that regulates these proteins in glioma cells is not fully understood. In this report, we demonstrate that a peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ (PPARγ) agonist, troglitazone, facilitates caspase-8 and -9 actions by down-regulating FLIP and Bcl-2 in human glioma cells. Troglitazone induces inactivation of signal transducer and activator of transcription-3 (STAT3) and synergistically enhances the cytotoxic effects of TRAIL and other caspase-dependent chemotherapeutic drugs. This effect is exhibited through a PPARγ-independent mechanism, in which protein-tyrosine phosphatase 1B (PTP1B) plays a critical role in the down-regulation of activated STAT3, as well as FLIP and Bcl-2. Here we propose a novel mechanism to explain the pro-apoptotic effect induced by troglitazone in human glioma cells. Tumor Cells—A human primary cultured glioma (MG-328) was established from the surgical specimen of a patient with newly diagnosed glioblastoma at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center after Institutional Review Board-approved consent was obtained. MG-328 and human glioma cell lines, U-87MG (American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA) and LN-18 (provided by Dr. Erwin Van Meier, Emory University, GA), were maintained at 37 °C and 5% CO2 in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 2 mm glutamate, 10 mm HEPES, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Reagents—Recombinant human TRAIL was obtained from PeproTech (Rocky Hill, NJ). A PPARγ agonist, troglitazone (TG), was obtained from Biomol (Plymouth Meeting, PA). A PPARγ antagonist, GW9662 (GW), was obtained from Cayman Chemical (Ann Arbor, MI). PTPI, α-bromo-4-hydroxyacetophenone, and Src homology 2-containing PTP (SHP) inhibitor (SHPI), α-bromo-4-carboxymethoxyacetophenone, were obtained from Calbiochem. Etoposide (VP16) and paclitaxel (Taxol) were obtained from Sigma. TG, GW, PTPI, SHPI, VP16, and Taxol were dissolved in 100% Me2SO as 1000× stock solution and then diluted further in culture medium. Cells were treated with rTRAIL (17.5–300 ng/ml), TG (30 μm), GW (20 μm), PTPI (50 μm), SHPI (200 μm), VP16 (0.01–10 μm), and/or Taxol (0.005–5 μm). siRNA Design and Transfection—A double-stranded siRNA oligonucleotide against STAT3 was designed as follows and as described previously (18Konnikova L. Kotecki M. Kruger M.M. Cochran B.H. BMC Cancer. 2003; 10.1186/1471-2407-3-23PubMed Google Scholar): 5′-AAC AUC UGC CUA GAU CGG CUA dTdT-3′; 3′-dTdT GUA GAC GGA UCU AGG CGA U-5′(STAT3-siRNA; Dharmacon RNA Technologies, Lafayette, CO). siRNA for nonsilencing control (nonsilencing siRNA) is an irrelevant siRNA with random nucleotides and no known specificity. Sequences were synthesized and annealed by the manufacturer (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) as described previously (19Liu G. Ng H. Akasaki Y. Yuan X. Ehtesham M. Yin D. Black K.L. Yu J.S. Eur. J. Immunol. 2004; 34: 1680-1687Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). STAT3-siRNA (50–600 pmol) or nonsilencing siRNA (600 pmol) was transfected to glioma cells (1 × 106 cells) with Oligofectamine reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol, and the cells were used for experiments 24 h after transfection. RNA Isolation and cDNA Synthesis—Total RNA was extracted from glioma cells (1 × 106 cells) using the RNA4PCR kit (Ambion, Austin, TX) according to the manufacturer's protocol. For cDNA synthesis, 1 μg of total RNA was reverse-transcribed into cDNA using oligo(dT) primer and iScript™ cDNA synthesis kit reverse transcriptase. cDNA was stored at –20 °C for PCR. Real Time Quantitative Reverse Transcription-PCR—Gene expression was quantified by real time quantitative reverse transcription-PCR using QuantiTect SYBR Green dye (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). DNA amplification was performed using an Icycler (Bio-Rad), and the binding of the fluorescence dye SYBR Green I to double-stranded DNA was measured. The PCRs were set up in microtubes at a volume of 25 μl. Oligonucleotide primers were designed as follows: STAT3 forward, 5′-GCC AGA GAG CCA GGA GCA-3′, STAT3 reverse, 5′-ACA CAG ATA AAC TTG GTC TTC AGG TAT G-3′; and β-actin forward, 5′-TTC TAC AAT GAG CTG CGT GTG-3′, β-actin reverse, 5′-GGG GTG TTG AAG GTC TCA AA-3′. The reaction components were 2.0 μgof cDNA synthesized as above, 12.5 μl of 2× QuantiTect SYBR Green PCR Master Mix (Qiagen, Valencia, CA), and 0.4 μm each pair of oligonucleotide primers. The program was as follows: initial activation for 15 min at 95 °C, 50 cycles consisting of melting for 30 s at 95 °C, annealing for 25 s at 60 °C, and extension for 30 s at 72 °C. After cycling, relative quantification of target gene mRNA against an internal control, β-actin, was possible by the following a ΔCT method, and an amplification plot of fluorescence signal versus cycle number was drawn. The difference (ΔCT) between the mean values in duplicated samples of the target gene and those of β-actin was calculated using Microsoft Excel, and the relative quantification value was expressed as 2–CΔT. The relative expression of each sample in the figure was normalized by “no treatment” expression. Abs—Rabbit polyclonal Abs against DR4, DR5, and PPARγ were obtained from Cayman Chemical. Mouse monoclonal Abs against STAT3, phosphotyrosine 705 STAT3 (pY705-STAT3), which is an activated form of STAT3, Bax, and Bcl-2 were obtained from Pharmingen. Rabbit polyclonal Abs against p53 and phosphor-Ser-392-p53 (pS392-p53) were obtained from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA). Mouse monoclonal Abs against PTP1B (PTPase1B; AE4-2J) and Src homology 2-containing PTP-1 (SHP1; 1SH01) and rabbit polyclonal Ab against FLIP were obtained from Calbiochem. Mouse monoclonal Ab of β-tubulin was obtained from Sigma. Horseradish peroxidase-linked Abs of sheep anti-mouse IgG and donkey anti-rabbit IgG were obtained from Amersham Biosciences. Western Blot—Samples were extracted with buffer containing 1% Triton X-100, 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris (pH 7.5), and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (Roche Applied Science) and were subjected to SDS-PAGE with 30 μg of general protein loading into each lane on a 10% polyacrylamide gel. Electrophoretic transfer to nitrocellulose membranes (Amersham Biosciences) was followed by immunoblotting. The signal was detected by using an ECL detection system (Amersham Biosciences). Apoptosis Assay and Cell Viability Assay—Treatment of cells with TG, GW, PTPI, and/or SHPI for 24 h was followed by treatment with rTRAIL (VP16 or Taxol), and all the cells, including cells that had not adhered, were harvested after 24 h (48 h). An annexin V-fluorescein isothiocyanate apoptosis detection kit I (Pharmingen) was used for viability assay of the cells. Cells were stained with annexin V-fluorescein isothiocyanate (Ann) and propidium iodide (PI) according to the manufacturer's protocol and were analyzed by FACS (Pharmingen). Cells that stained negative for both Ann and PI were defined as viable cells for viability assay. Caspase Activity Assay—Activity of caspase-3, -8, and -9 was measured using caspase-3/CPP32, FLICE/caspase-8, and APOPCYTO/caspase-9 colorimetric assay kits, respectively, from Medical and Biological Laboratories Co. (Nagoya, Japan). Briefly, the treatment of cells with TG, GW, and/or PTPI for 24 h was followed by treatment with rTRAIL (VP16 or Taxol). After 2 h (24 h) of treatment, all the cells were harvested, and samples were extracted with Cell Lysis Buffer. Concurrently, a sample for a negative control was extracted from the cells without apoptosis induction. A standard curve using the absorbance of p-nitroanilide standards was constructed, and then the specific activities on each sample were calculated according to the manufacturer's protocol. Statistics—Student's t test was used for statistical comparison of results. The Role of STAT3 in Resistance to TRAIL-induced Apoptosis—To examine the mechanism that causes resistance to TRAIL, we used glioma cell lines that are partially resistant to TRAIL despite their expression of DR4 and/or DR5. Western blot was used to detect the expression levels of DR4 and DR5 in LN-18, U-87MG, and MG-328 (Fig. 1A). The cytotoxic activity of TRAIL (18.75–300 ng/ml) was examined in each glioma (Fig. 1, B and C). As shown in Fig. 1B, which is a representative result of FACS analysis using an annexin-V apoptosis detection kit on LN-18, treatment with TRAIL (300 ng/ml) increased the percentage of Ann(+)PI(–) cells, which indicates early stage of apoptosis, after 2 h of treatment (33.7%) and 24 h of treatment (60.1%) compared with no treatment control (2.2%). Treatment with 300 ng/ml of TRAIL induced 40–60% cell death after 24 h of treatment (Fig. 1C), although the viable cells maintained a proliferative ability after 72 h of cell culture with 300 ng/ml TRAIL (not shown). These findings indicate that these gliomas can acquire a resistance to TRAIL despite their expression of functionally intact DR4/5. After this observation, we sought to determine whether STAT3 contributes to the resistance of gliomas to TRAIL by using STAT3-specific small interference RNA (STAT3-siRNA) (18Konnikova L. Kotecki M. Kruger M.M. Cochran B.H. BMC Cancer. 2003; 10.1186/1471-2407-3-23PubMed Google Scholar). The specificity of STAT3 inhibition in LN-18 after transfection with STAT3-siRNA was investigated by real time quantitative PCR and Western blot analysis (Fig. 2, A and B). Although neither nonsilencing control nor vehicle control had any significant change in expressions of STAT3 mRNA or STAT3 protein compared with the no treatment control, STAT3-siRNA transfection in glioma cells decreased both STAT3 mRNA (Fig. 2A) and STAT3 protein (Fig. 2B) expressions in a dose-dependent manner. These findings indicate that the STAT3-siRNA used in this study exhibited a STAT3-specific silencing effect. As shown in Fig. 2, B and C, Western blot analysis detected high levels of STAT3, pY705-STAT3, FLIP, and Bcl-2 in the no treatment control, nonsilencing control, and vehicle control. The pY705-STAT3 was down-regulated concomitant with the decrease in STAT3 in STAT3-siRNA-transfected glioma cells (Fig. 2, B and C). In addition, FLIP and Bcl-2 expression levels decreased in the STAT3-siRNA groups (Fig. 2, B and C), suggesting that knockdown of STAT3 induces down-regulation of FLIP and Bcl-2 in glioma cells by inhibiting the transcriptional activity of STAT3. Bax expression levels, which is a pro-apoptotic protein induced by p53, were not altered by knockdown of STAT3 (Fig. 2, B and C). To confirm further the regulatory function of STAT3 on the DR-signaling pathway, the nonsilencing control, vehicle control, and STAT3-siRNA-transfected cells were treated with 100 ng/ml TRAIL, and then cell viability (Fig. 2D) and caspase activity assays (Fig. 2E) were performed. Transfection of STAT3-siRNA to glioma cells did not induce their apoptotic death, but it significantly enhanced the cytotoxic effect of TRAIL (Fig. 2D). The specific activities of caspases-3, -8, and -9 were also significantly increased in the siRNA-transfected group (Fig. 2E). In the assessment of the 72-h cell culture, TRAIL (100 ng/ml) killed more than 95% of the cells in the siRNA-transfected group of each glioma (not shown). These results indicate that STAT3 plays a critical role in the resistance of gliomas to TRAIL. Down-regulation of FLIP and Bcl-2 in the STAT3-siRNA-transfected group may have a particular relevance to the facilitation of the activity of caspase-3, -8, and -9. Troglitazone Activities via PPARγ-dependent and -independent Pathways—We sought to determine whether a PPARγ agonist would enhance TRAIL-induced apoptosis. Using a Western blot analysis, PPARγ expression was observed in LN-18 and U-87 but not in MG-328 (Fig. 3A). Treatment over 48 h with TG, which is a pharmacological PPARγ agonist, did not induce apoptotic death on glioma cells but did significantly enhance the cytotoxic activity of TRAIL not only in LN-18 and U-87MG but also in MG-328 (Fig. 3B). These results suggest the possibility that the synergistic effect of TG on TRAIL is controlled by a PPARγ-independent mechanism. Although TG had no effect on STAT3 expression levels, it induced down-regulation of pY705-STAT3 (Fig. 3C). In addition, TG diminished FLIP and Bcl-2 protein expression in these cells (Fig. 3C), which was probably caused by down-regulation of pY705-STAT3. TG treatment in U-87MG, of which p53 is a wild type (20Van Meir E.G. Kikuchi T. Tada M. Li H. Diserens A.C. Wojcik B.E. Huang H.J. Friedmann T. de Tribolet N. Cavenee W.K. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 649-652PubMed Google Scholar), increased Bax expression levels, although Bax levels were not altered in LN-18, which is a p53 mutant cell line (20Van Meir E.G. Kikuchi T. Tada M. Li H. Diserens A.C. Wojcik B.E. Huang H.J. Friedmann T. de Tribolet N. Cavenee W.K. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 649-652PubMed Google Scholar), or in MG-328 (Fig. 3C). Although we did not confirm the sequence of p53 in MG-328, this result may indicate that TG up-regulates a transcriptional activity of p53 via a PPARγ-dependent pathway, in which wild-type p53 should induce up-regulation of Bax. Next, we used a PPARγ antagonist, GW9662 (GW), to clarify the role of PPARγ in the effect of TG on these glioma cells. Similar to the effect of TG alone, down-regulation of pY705-STAT3 was observed on the cells treated with TG and GW (Fig. 4A), indicating that the inhibitory effect of TG on pY705-STAT3 is caused via a PPARγ-independent pathway. In a previous report, it was demonstrated that phosphorylation of p53 at Ser-392 (pS392-p53) influenced the growth suppressor function and transcriptional activation of p53 (21Kohn K.W. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 2703-2734Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar). Based on this report, we confirmed the expression levels of pS392-p53 as an index of the transcriptional activity of p53. As shown in Fig. 4A, GW abrogated the up-regulation of pS392-p53 induced by TG in LN-18 and U-87MG. GW also inhibited the up-regulation of Bax found in TG-treated U-87MG. There was no significant change in the expression levels of pS392-p53 or Bax in MG-328 in either setting (Fig. 4A). These results indicate that TG induces phosphorylation of p53 at Ser-392 via a PPARγ-dependent pathway and causes up-regulation of Bax in gliomas that have a wild-type p53. Although these results suggest that TG may have the potential to control caspase cascade signaling via both PPARγ-dependent and -independent pathways, the synergistic activity of TG in TRAIL-treated glioma cells was not blocked by a PPARγ antagonist even in U-87MG, as assessed by a cell viability assay (Fig. 4B). In addition, treatment with GW did not reduce the specific activities in any caspases that we observed (Fig. 4C), indicating that the synergism of TG in TRAIL-treated glioma cells occurs through a PPARγ-independent mechanism. Taken together, these results indicate that inactivation of STAT3 and the subsequent down-regulation of the downstream proteins, such as FLIP and Bcl-2, by TG may have a particular relevance to the mechanism by which TG synergistically enhances the pro-apoptotic effect of TRAIL. The Significance of PTP1B Activity in the Effect of TG—PTP1B negatively regulates tyrosine phosphorylation of JAK2 and STAT3 (22Zabolotny J.M. Bence-Hanulec K.K. Stricker-Krongrad A. Haj F. Wang Y.

In addition, SHP-1 negatively regulates STAT3 activity by facilitating tyrosine dephosphorylation of the upstream JAK2 (24Bousquet C. Susini C. Melmed S. J. Clin. Investig. 1999; 104: 1277-1285Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Based on these findings, we hypothesized that the inhibitory effect of TG on pY705-STAT3 may be caused by activation of these PTP proteins. To confirm the relationship between pY705-STAT3 and PTPs, protein samples extracted at different time points after treatment with TG were subjected to Western blot in which pY705-STAT3, PTP1B, and SHP-1 expression levels were analyzed (Fig. 5). In this assay, up-regulation of the activated form of PTP1B (42 kDa), which is induced by a proteolysis of 50-kDa PTP1B (25Frangioni J.V. Beahm P.H. Shifrin V. Jost C.A. Neel B.G.

On the other hand, down-regulation of pY705-STAT3 was noticeable at 8 h, and its expression continued to decrease after 8 h until 32 h. SHP-1 was constitutively and highly expressed in all of these gliomas, and TG had only a negligible effect on SHP-1 expression. To confirm the role of PTP activity in the mechanism controlling the synergistic effect of TG on TRAIL-treated glioma cells, we used α-bromo-4-hydroxyacetophenone (PTPI), which is an inhibitor for both PTP1B and SHP-1, and α-bromo-4-carboxymethoxyacetophenone (SHPI), which is a specific inhibitor for SHP-1 (27Arabaci G. Guo X.-C. Beebe K.D. Coggeshall K.M. Pei D. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1999; 121: 5085-5086Crossref Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Specifically, TG-treated glioma cells were co-treated with PTPI or SHPI and were then assessed by Western blot and by cell viability and caspase activity assays. In the Western blot analysis, PTPI abrogated the inhibitory effect of TG on pY705-STAT3 (Fig. 6A), whereas SHPI did not inhibit the down-regulation of pY705-STAT3 induced by TG (Fig. 6B). These findings indicate that activation of PTP1B, but not SHP-1, is involved in the inhibitory effect of TG on pY705-STAT3. PTPI did not inhibit the up-regulation of pS392-p53 in LN-18 and U-87MG caused by TG. Neither STAT3 nor p53 expression levels were altered in either setting (Fig. 6A). In the cell viability (not shown) and caspase activity assays (Fig. 6C), PTPI abrogated the synergistic effect of TG on TRAIL, although SHPI did not abrogate it (not shown). Thus, these results indicate that PTP1B plays a critical role in TG's effect that enhances the cytotoxic activity of TRAIL in glioma cells. Furthermore, we sought to determine whether STAT3 inactivation is a key target for PTP1B in this mechanism. To confirm this, STAT3-siRNA-transfected glioma cells were treated with TG, PTPI, and TRAIL and were then subjected to caspase activity assay. In this assessment, the inhibitory effect of PTPI on TG was negated in the STAT3-siRNA-transfected glioma cells (Fig. 6D). These results indicate that activation of PTP1B by means of proteolysis of 50-kDa PTP1B and the subsequent tyrosine dephosphorylation of pY705-STAT3 is a key mechanism in this effect.

In this study, we characterize the activation and functional role of SLK. SLK underwent dimerization via the C-terminal domain, and dimerization enhanced SLK activity. In contrast, the C-terminal domain of SLK did not dimerize with a related kinase, Mst1, and did not affect Mst1 activity. Phosphorylation/dephosphorylation of SLK were not associated with changes in kinase activity. SLK induced phosphorylation of apoptosis signal-regulating kinase-1 (ASK1) and increased ASK1 activity, indicating that ASK1 is a substrate of SLK. Moreover, SLK stimulated phosphorylation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase via ASK1, but not c-Jun N-terminal kinase nor extracellular signal-regulated kinase. Chemical anoxia and recovery during re-exposure to glucose (ischemia-reperfusion injury in cell culture) stimulated SLK activity. Overexpression of SLK enhanced anoxia/recovery-induced apoptosis, release of cytochrome c, and activities of caspase-8 and -9, and apoptosis was reduced significantly with p38 and caspase-9 inhibitors. Induction of the endoplasmic reticulum stress response by anoxia/recovery or tunicamycin (monitored by induction of Bip or Grp94 expression, phosphorylation of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2α subunit, expression of CHOP, and activation of caspase-12) was attenuated in cells that overexpress SLK. Thus, SLK is an anoxia/recovery-dependent kinase that is activated via homodimerization and that signals via ASK1 and p38 to promote apoptosis. Attenuation of the protective aspects of the endoplasmic reticulum stress response by SLK may contribute to its proapoptotic effect.

The mammalian germinal center kinases (GCKs) 3The abbreviations used are: GCK, germinal center kinase; ASK1, apoptosis signal-regulating kinase-1; ER, endoplasmic reticulum, ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; GEC, glomerular epithelial cell; GST, glutathione S-transferase; SLK, Ste20-like kinase; GST-SLK(CT), GST-SLK C-terminal domain fusion protein; HA, hemagglutinin antigen epitope tag; JNK, c-Jun N-terminal kinase; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; MDCK, Madin-Darby canine kidney. comprise a family of protein kinases that are homologous to Ste20 of S. cerevisiae (1Kyriakis J.M. Avruch J. BioEssays. 1996; 18: 567-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (661) Google Scholar, 2Kyriakis J.M. J. Biol.

Rev. 2001; 81: 807-869Crossref PubMed Scopus (2885) Google Scholar). All GCKs possess N-terminal kinase domains and C-terminal regulatory domains, some of which are extensive. Originally, the GCKs were divided into two groups. The group I GCKs interact with mitogenactivated protein kinase (MAPK) kinase kinase-1, and they activate the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) pathway but not extracellular signal-regulated (ERK) or p38 pathways. Several group I GCKs are activated by tumor necrosis factor, and their biology has been reviewed previously (2Kyriakis J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5259-5262Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). The original group II GCKs have been more recently subdivided into seven families (i.e. groups II–VIII) (3Dan I. Watanabe N.M. Kusumi A. Trends Cell Biol. 2001; 11: 220-230Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (509) Google Scholar). These GCKs are expressed ubiquitously, with the exception of lymphocyte-oriented kinase (5Kuramochi S. Moriguchi T. Kuida K. Endo J. Semba K. Nishida E. Karasuyama H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22679-22684Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), which is expressed in lymphocytes. Some of these GCKs can be activated in vivo by various stresses (e.g. heat-shock, arsenite, staurosporine, ischemic injury, or ATP depletion) (6Pombo C.M. Bonventre J.V. Molnar A. Kyriakis J. Force T. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4537-4546Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 7Pombo C.M. Tsujita T. Kyriakis J.M. Bonventre J.V. Force T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29372-29379Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Most of the group II–VIII GCKs do not fit into the well defined MAPK pathways. These kinases do not activate ERK, JNK, or p38 pathways, although there may be one or two exceptions (8Graves J.D. Gotoh Y. Draves K.E. Ambrose D. Han D.K. Wright M. Chernoff J. Clark E.A. Krebs E.G.

Seale P. Wagner J. Rudnicki M.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 684-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Kidney development is dependent on growth factors, activation of growth factor receptors, and interaction of cells with extracellular matrices (11Sorokin L. Ekblom P. Kidney Int. 1992; 41: 657-664Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). During development, there is proliferation of renal cells as well as apoptosis (12Koseki C. Herzlinger D. al-Awqati Q. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 1327-1333Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar, 13Savill J. Kidney Int. 1999; 56: 1216-1222Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), and tight control of cell growth and apoptosis is essential for formation of normal renal anatomy and cell differentiation. In the mature kidney, interruption of blood flow leads to ischemia, which is a major cause of acute renal failure (14Liu J. Takano T. Papillon J. Khadir A. Cybulsky A.V. Biochem. J. 2001; 353: 79-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 15Thadhani R. Pascual M. Bonventre J.V. N. Engl. J. Med. 1996; 334: 1448-1460Crossref PubMed Scopus (1513) Google Scholar). Ischemia typically injures renal tubular epithelial cells and also glomerular cells and is characterized by ATP depletion and other metabolic derangements. Reperfusion (upon restoration of blood flow) is associated with production of reactive oxygen species. Ischemia-reperfusion may lead to apoptosis or necrosis of kidney cells, but the cells that survive the insult may undergo a process resembling development, which includes dedifferentiation, re-entry into the cell cycle, and proliferation to replace the dead cells. In cultured cells, chemical anoxia and glucose re-exposure recapitulates the ATP depletion and production of reactive oxygen species seen during ischemia in vivo. During screening of rat fetal kidney mRNA for protein-tyrosine kinases, we discovered a mRNA consistent with the group V GCK, Ste20-like kinase (SLK, or SK2 in the rat). Expression of SLK mRNA and protein as well as kinase activity were increased in rat fetal kidney homogenates (embryonic days 17–21), as compared with adult control kidneys (16Cybulsky A.V. Takano T. Papillon J. Khadir A. Bijian K. Chien C.C. Alpers C.E. Rabb H. Am. J. Physiol. Renal Physiol. 2004; 286: F16-F25Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Moreover, in adult kidneys subjected to ischemia-reperfusion injury, SLK mRNA and protein expression and kinase activity were increased, as compared with untreated contralateral control kidneys. By immunohistochemistry, SLK expression was evident mainly in the cytoplasm of tubular epithelial cells in fetal and adult kidneys, and there was some expression in developing and mature glomerular epithelial cells (GECs, or podocytes). Thus, SLK is a renal epithelial protein kinase, whose expression and activity are increased during development as well as recovery from acute renal failure, where injured tubular epithelial cells may regenerate by recapitulating developmental processes. Localization in GECs also suggests a possible role in glomerulogenesis or glomerular injury. In cell culture, incubation of epithelial cells with serum or exposure to chemical anoxia, followed by re-exposure to glucose (in vitro ischemia-reperfusion), increased SLK activity. Overexpression of SLK in epithelial cells attenuated increases in cell number under normal culture conditions, probably at least in part due to apoptosis, and, in the setting of anoxia, exacerbated cell death. Thus, activation of SLK may attenuate cell proliferation during kidney development or recovery from ischemic injury. Furthermore, activation of SLK may actually exacerbate injury or delay recovery. In other cell lines, transient overexpression of SLK induced apoptosis (9Sabourin L.A. Rudnicki M.A. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 7566-7575Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 10Sabourin L.A. Tamai K. Seale P. Wagner J. Rudnicki M.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 684-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), and in these studies the authors were unable to generate stably transfected cell lines, since SLK overexpression appeared to be cytotoxic. Epidermal growth factor, anisomycin, and hyperosmolality did not stimulate SLK activity in transfected COS-7 cells, and transfection of constitutively active Ras, Rac, or cell division cycle-42 also did not enhance SLK activity (17Yamada E. Tsujikawa K. Itoh S. Kameda Y. Kohama Y. Yamamoto H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1495: 250-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). These characteristics are generally in keeping with other group II–VIII GCKs (2Kyriakis J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5259-5262Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). The regulation and signaling by group II–VIII GCKs is poorly understood (2Kyriakis J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5259-5262Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 3Dan I. Watanabe N.M. Kusumi A. Trends Cell Biol. 2001; 11: 220-230Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (509) Google Scholar). By analogy to some non-GCKs (18Buse P. Tran S.H. Luther E. Phu P.T. Aponte G.W. Firestone G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7253-7263Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 19Sivaraman V.S. Wang H. Nuovo G.J. Malbon C.C. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 1478-1483Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar), our results suggest that SLK may be, in part, regulated via changes in mRNA/protein expression (e.g. transcriptional or post-transcriptional regulation) (20Atwater J.A. Wisdom R. Verma I.M. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1990; 24: 519-541Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar, 21Bernstein P. Ross J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1989; 14: 373-377Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar, 22Shaw G. Kamen R. Cell. 1986; 46: 659-667Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3123) Google Scholar). Many protein kinases, including some GCKs, are believed to be regulated by phosphorylation. For example, in vitro, Mst1 can be activated by phosphatase 2A, whereas activities of SOK1 and SLK are reported to be dependent upon autophosphorylation (6Pombo C.M. Bonventre J.V. Molnar A. Kyriakis J. Force T. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4537-4546Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 9Sabourin L.A. Rudnicki M.A. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 7566-7575Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). GCKs may possess significant basal activity when immunoprecipitated from endogenous sources or when overexpressed (2Kyriakis J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5259-5262Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 17Yamada E. Tsujikawa K. Itoh S. Kameda Y. Kohama Y. Yamamoto H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1495: 250-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). SLK (and other GCKs) have a coiled-coil structure in their C-terminal domains, and certain proteins with the coiled-coil structure are known to oligomerize by means of this structure (23Lupas A. Van Dyke M. Stock J. Science. 1991; 252: 1162-1164Crossref PubMed Scopus (3471) Google Scholar). Thus, SOK1 and Mst1 spontaneously homodimerize in vivo. Since SLK shows some constitutive activity when overexpressed in COS-7 cells (17Yamada E. Tsujikawa K. Itoh S. Kameda Y. Kohama Y. Yamamoto H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1495: 250-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), it is reasonable to propose that increased expression of SLK in the developing kidney or after ischemic injury may facilitate interaction of SLK with itself or other coiled-coil proteins and enhance kinase activity. The present study demonstrates that SLK is an ischemia-reperfusion-dependent protein kinase that may be activated via homodimerization and that signals via apoptosis signal-regulating kinase-1 (ASK1) and p38 MAPK to promote apoptosis. Furthermore, SLK attenuates the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress response, which may contribute to its proapoptotic effect.

To construct Myc-His-tagged SLK, the cDNA of full-length SLK plus the 3′-untranslated region (kindly provided by Dr. T. Nagase, Kazusa DNA Research Institute, Japan) was subcloned into the expression vector pcDNA3.1/Myc-His(–). (This construct will express full-length SLK but not the Myc-His tag.) The portion of hSLK between a unique 3426-bp XhoI site and the 3′ NotI site in the vector was excised to remove the stop codon at 3970 bp (plus the 3′-untranslated region) and was replaced with a 484-bp PCR fragment (primers 5′-AGAGCTCGAGAAGCTGCAA and 3′-TGGTTGAGCATGCGGCCGCGAAACTGA) that excludes the stop codon and allows transcription of SLK tagged with Myc-His at the C terminus. Expression of Myc-His-SLK in transiently transfected COS-1 cells is presented in Fig. 1A. Cell Culture and Transfection—COS-1 cells were employed for studies involving transient transfection. For stable transfection of SLK, we employed Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells (a kidney tubule epithelial cell line) and rat GECs. Some studies were carried out in both MDCK cells and GECs (16Cybulsky A.V. Takano T. Papillon J. Khadir A. Bijian K. Chien C.C. Alpers C.E. Rabb H. Am. J. Physiol.

MDCK cells and COS cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium plus 10% fetal calf serum. GEC culture and characterization has been published previously (24Coers W. Reivinen J.

Stable transfection of MDCK cells with HA-SLK cDNA was performed using Fugene-6, according to the manufacturer's instructions. After primary selection with G418, stably transfected clones were selected by immunoblotting with anti-HA antibody. Stable transfection of MDCK cells with HA-SLK cDNA is shown in Fig. 1B. Immunoblotting with anti-HA antibody demonstrated that some but not all transfected clones stably overexpress HA-SLK (Fig. 1B). The amounts of overexpression were variable, and even the highest levels of overexpression were relatively low. Clone 11, which shows the highest level of overexpression (Fig. 1, B and C), was selected for further studies. Clones of GECs that stably express HA-SLK (Fig. 1C) were characterized previously (16Cybulsky A.V. Takano T. Papillon J. Khadir A. Bijian K. Chien C.C. Alpers C.E. Rabb H. Am. J. Physiol.

Proteins were immunoprecipitated with primary antibody IgG (2 h, 4 °C) or nonimmune IgG in controls (background), followed by absorption with agarose-coupled protein A (1 h, 4 °C). The immunoprecipitates were then mixed with 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.2, 20 mm β-glycerophosphate, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm Na3VO4, 0.5 mg/ml bovine brain myelin basic protein, and 20 μm [γ-32P]ATP (5 μCi). GST-SLK(CT) (0.2 μg) was added in some experiments. After a 5-min incubation at 30 °C, the reaction was terminated by the addition of Laemmli buffer, and the mixture was subjected to SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. Densitometry of immunoblots or autoradiograms was performed using NIH Image software. For immunoblotting, equal amounts of proteins were loaded into each lane of a gel. Preliminary studies demonstrated that there was a linear relationship between densitometric measurements and the amounts of protein loaded onto gels.

Changes in cell number were determined by trypsinization of adherent cells, followed by visual counting of cells in a hemacytometer (27Bijian K. Takano T. Papillon J. Khadir A. Cybulsky A.V. Am. J. Physiol. Renal Physiol. 2004; 286: F255-F266Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). To measure [3H]thymidine incorporation, cells were plated into 24-well plates at 5,000 cells/well. At 24 or 48 h, 0.5 μCi of [3H]thymidine was added to wells for 6 h. Cells were washed four times with phosphate-buffered saline and were solubilized with 0.1 m NaOH. Lysates were added to scintillation fluid, and radioactivity was quantified in a β-scintillation counter. For cell cycle analysis, cells were maintained at confluence for 5–7 days and were incubated in serum-poor medium (0.5% fetal calf serum) for the final 48 h. Cells were then replated in serum-replete medium and were trypsinized at 24 h. The cells were resuspended in 1.0 ml of phosphate-buffered saline and were added to 4.0 ml of 100% ethanol (–20 °C). Cells were centrifuged and resuspended in 0.125 ml of 1.12% sodium citrate, containing 2.5 μg of RNase A, and were incubated for 30 min at 37 °C. Then 0.375 ml of 1.12% sodium citrate containing 0.05 mg/ml propidium iodide was added for 30 min at 22 °C. DNA content was measured by fluorescence-activated cell sorting and was analyzed using the CellQuest program (BD Biosciences). Data are presented as the percentage of cells in G1 phase (2N DNA content), G2/M phase (4N DNA content), and apoptosis (<2N DNA content). Statistics—Data are presented as mean ± S.E. The t statistic was used to determine significant differences between two groups. One-way analysis of variance was used to determine significant differences among groups. Where significant differences were found, individual comparisons were made between groups using the t statistic and adjusting the critical value according to the Bonferroni method. Dimerization of the SLK C-terminal Domain Increases SLK Activity— The first series of experiments addressed the activation of SLK. Analysis of SLK using the SMART program (28Letunic I. Copley R.R. Schmidt S. Ciccarelli F.D. Doerks T. Schultz J. Ponting C.P. Bork P. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: D142-D144Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) shows an α-helical coiled-coil structure (23Lupas A. Van Dyke M. Stock J. Science. 1991; 252: 1162-1164Crossref PubMed Scopus (3471) Google Scholar) in the C-terminal domain. Certain proteins with coiled-coils are believed to dimerize/oligomerize via this structure. To address the potential role of homodimerization, homogenates of MDCK cells stably transfected with HA-SLK were incubated with GST-SLK(CT). Proteins were immunoprecipitated with anti-HA antibody or absorbed with glutathione-agarose and were then immunoblotted with anti-SLK antibody. Anti-HA immunoprecipitation specifically recovered GST-SLK(CT), implying dimerization of HA-SLK with GST-SLK(CT) (Fig. 2A, lane 1) and suggesting that full-length SLK can homodimerize via the C-terminal domain. We were not able to recover HA-SLK with glutathione-agarose (Fig. 2A, lane 3). This negative result was probably due to a relatively low SLK concentration in cell homogenates, reflecting the relatively low expression level of HA-SLK in MDCK cells (Fig. 1C). Higher levels of SLK overexpression could not be achieved even with transient transfection in COS cells, perhaps because of cytotoxicity (9Sabourin L.A. Rudnicki M.A. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 7566-7575Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 10Sabourin L.A. Tamai K. Seale P. Wagner J. Rudnicki M.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 684-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Alternatively, the experimental conditions may have favored homodimerization of GST-SLK(CT), and thus, the GST-SLK(CT)-HA-SLK interaction was below the level of detectability. To determine whether dimerization of SLK via the C-terminal region increases SLK activity, homogenates of MDCK cells stably transfected with HA-SLK were incubated with or without purified GST-SLK(CT). SLK activity was then assessed in an immune complex kinase assay (Fig. 2B). In the presence of GST-SLK(CT), SLK activity was increased by ∼2-fold. Together with the result in Fig. 2A, the result suggests that homodimerization of SLK via the C-terminal region increases kinase activity. A related member of the GCK family, Mst1 (group II GCK), is reported to undergo homodimerization via its C-terminal domain. Heterodimerization of Mst1 with SLK would raise the possibility of cross-talk between the two kinases, potentially allowing for signal amplification and increased diversity of downstream effectors. To determine if SLK could heterodimerize with Mst1, homogenates of COS cells transiently transfected with FLAG-Mst1 cDNA were incubated with GST-SLK(CT). Proteins were immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG antibody (Fig. 3A) or absorbed with glutathione-agarose (Fig. 3B) and were then immunoblotted with anti-SLK or anti-FLAG antibodies, respectively. GST-SLK(CT) did not appear to dimerize with Mst1, and moreover, GST-SLK(CT) did not affect Mst1 kinase activity (Fig. 3C). The next series of experiments addressed the role of phosphorylation in regulating SLK activity. Phosphorylation of SLK was induced by incubation of MDCK cells that overexpress HA-SLK with calyculin A, a serine/threonine protein phosphatase inhibitor (which inhibits phosphatases 1 and 2). Calyculin A was proapoptotic in MDCK cells, although at 20–50 nm, apoptosis was only 1.3–4.3%, whereas at 100 nm, apoptosis reached 94–100% (4 h of incubation). Calyculin A (50 nm) increased SLK phosphorylation, as compared with untreated cells (Fig. 2C). Subsequent treatment with calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase resulted in dephosphorylation of SLK (Fig. 2C). These changes in SLK phosphorylation/dephosphorylation did not, however, correlate with changes in SLK activity (Fig. 2D), indicating that SLK activity is not dependent on phosphor"
https://openalex.org/W2071720275,"Poly(A)-specific ribonuclease (PARN) is a cap-interacting and poly(A)-specific 3'-exoribonuclease. Here we have investigated how the cap binding complex (CBC) affects human PARN activity. We showed that CBC, via its 80-kDa subunit (CBP80), inhibited PARN, suggesting that CBC can regulate mRNA deadenylation. The CBC-mediated inhibition of PARN was cap-independent, and in keeping with this, the CBP80 subunit alone inhibited PARN. Our data suggested a new function for CBC, identified CBC as a potential regulator of PARN, and emphasized the importance of communication between the two extreme ends of the mRNA as a key strategy to regulate mRNA degradation. Based on our data, we have proposed a model for CBC-mediated regulation of PARN, which relies on an interaction between CBP80 and PARN. Association of CBC with PARN might have importance in the regulated recruitment of PARN to the nonsense-mediated decay pathway during the pioneer round of translation."
https://openalex.org/W2044290089,"Ribonucleotide reductase (RNR) is an essential enzyme that provides the cell with a balanced supply of deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates for DNA replication and repair. Mutations that affect the regulation of RNR in yeast and mammalian cells can lead to genetic abnormalities and cell death. We have expressed and purified the components of the RNR system in fission yeast, the large subunit Cdc22p, the small subunit Suc22p, and the replication inhibitor Spd1p. It was proposed (Liu, C., Powell, K. A., Mundt, K., Wu, L., Carr, A. M., and Caspari, T. (2003) Genes Dev. 17, 1130-1140) that Spd1 is an RNR inhibitor, acting by anchoring the Suc22p inside the nucleus during G1 phase. Using in vitro assays with highly purified proteins we have demonstrated that Spd1 indeed is a very efficient inhibitor of fission yeast RNR, but acting on Cdc22p. Furthermore, biosensor technique showed that Spd1p binds to the Cdc22p with a KD of 2.4 μm, whereas the affinity to Suc22p is negligible. Therefore, Spd1p inhibits fission yeast RNR activity by interacting with the Cdc22p. Similar to the situation in budding yeast, logarithmically growing fission yeast increases the dNTP pools 2-fold after 3 h of incubation in the UV mimetic 4-nitroquinoline-N-oxide. This increase is smaller than the increase observed in budding yeast but of the same order as the dNTP pool increase when synchronous Schizosaccharomyces pombe cdc10 cells are going from G1 to S-phase.

This increase is smaller than the increase observed in budding yeast but of the same order as the dNTP pool increase when synchronous Schizosaccharomyces pombe cdc10 cells are going from G1 to S-phase. Looking for novel fission yeast genes that cause cell cycle arrest when overexpressed, Woollard et al. (1Woollard A. Basi G. Nurse P. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4603-4612Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) cloned spd1 (for S-phase delayed). The encoded 14-kDa protein is cell cycle-regulated, and the levels decline during S-phase. Overexpression of spd1 inhibits G1/S progression downstream of Start, but it is not an essential gene. In a later publication, Borgne and Nurse (2Borgne A. Nurse P. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 4341-4350Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) demonstrated that overexpression of Spd1p blocks the onset of both S-phase and mitosis, and they suggested that the protein might act by interfering directly with DNA replication giving the same phenotype as that seen using the ribonucleotide reductase (RNR) 2The abbreviations used are: RNRribonucleotide reductasewtwild typeRUresonance unitHPLChigh pressure liquid chromatographyEPRelectron paramagnetic resonance4-NQO4-nitroquinoline-N-oxide. inhibitor hydroxyurea. ribonucleotide reductase wild type resonance unit high pressure liquid chromatography electron paramagnetic resonance 4-nitroquinoline-N-oxide. Null mutants of the fission yeast csn1-d and csn2-d signalosome subunits are slow growing and have a prolonged S-phase (3Mundt K.E. Porte J. Murray J.M. Brikos C. Christensen P.U. Caspari T. Hagan I.M. Millar J.B. Simanis V. Hofmann K. Carr A.M. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 1427-1430Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In a screen for multicopy suppressors of rad3-ts csn1-d lethality to identify the cause of the slow S-phase in signalosome mutants, Liu et al. (4Liu C. Powell K.A. Mundt K. Wu L. Carr A.M. Caspari T. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 1130-1140Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar) identified multiple independent clones of suc22 that rescued the growth defect. Suc22 encodes the small subunit of Schizosaccharomyces pombe RNR that together with the large subunit Cdc22p forms the active enzyme complex (5Fernandez-Sarabia M.J. McInerny C. Harris P. Gordon C. Fantes P. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1993; 238: 241-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Because the phenotype of spd1 overexpression resembled the phenotype of csn1-d or csn2-d mutants, Liu et al. combined the deletion of spd1 with either of the signalosome subunit mutants, and in both cases, loss of spd1 restored the normal cell cycle profile. They concluded from these experiments that Spd1p inhibits RNR activity and that the signalosome complex is required to release the inhibition during DNA replication or repair. Using indirect immunofluorescence microscopy, Liu et al. observed nuclear co-localization of Suc22p and Spd1p. Although no direct evidence was presented for interaction between the proteins, such an interaction was assumed in a model for the regulation of fission yeast RNR activity during S-phase and DNA repair. According to this model, Spd1p anchors the Suc22p inside the nucleus, thereby inhibiting RNR activity. To increase the supply of deoxyribonucleotides during DNA replication or repair, Spd1p is destroyed by the signalosome; this leads to a delocalization of the Suc22p from the nucleus to the cytoplasm where it combines with the Cdc22p to form active RNR. This model is cited in a number of publications and reviews (6Nielsen O. Curr. Biol. 2003; 13: R565-R567Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar, 7Bondar T. Ponomarev A.

In this report, we describe the expression and purification of the Cdc22p, Suc22p, and Spd1p and demonstrate by in vitro assays with highly purified recombinant proteins that Spd1p is a strong inhibitor of fission yeast RNR acting on Cdc22p. Furthermore, biosensor technique using chips with immobilized Spd1p shows that the inhibitor specifically binds to Cdc22p with a dissociation constant of 2.4 μm, whereas the affinity to Suc22p is negligible. Our data support a model where Spd1 regulates RNR activity by binding to the Cdc22p and not to the Suc22p. This mode of regulation is similar to the regulation of RNR activity in budding yeast, where binding of the low molecular weight inhibitor Sml1 to the Cdc22p homologue, the Rnr1p, controls RNR activity. Logarithmically growing budding yeast dramatically improves survival following DNA damage by increasing the deoxyribonucleotide pools to values much higher than in S-phase cells (10Chabes A. Georgieva B. Domkin V. Zhao X. Rothstein R. Thelander L. Cell. 2003; 112: 391-401Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar). We also observe an increase in deoxyribonucleotide pools in fission yeast after DNA damage. However, the increase is only 2-fold and of the same order as the increase in dNTP pools in synchronized, undamaged S-phase cells compared with G1 cells. Growth of Fission Yeast—Wt and the ts mutant strain cdc10-V50 were grown in YE medium. Synchronization of the cdc10 strain was accomplished by first growing the cells at 25 °C, shifting to 36 °C for 4 h, and then shifting back again to 25 °C (1Woollard A. Basi G. Nurse P. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4603-4612Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Flow cytometry was made according to Ref. 11Nilssen E.A. Synnes M. Kleckner N. Grallert B. Boye E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 10758-10763Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar using a Beckman Cytomics FC 500 machine. Protein Expression and Purification—Cdc22p, Suc22p, and Spd1p were expressed in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3)pLysS bacteria using the pET3a expression vector (Novagen). Plasmids containing the cdc22 and suc22 genes, pCDC22-1 and pSUC22-1, were gifts from Christopher J. McInerny, University of Glasgow, UK. A cDNA clone of spd1 (ARC 640:Spd1cDNA) in pREP41X was obtained from Paul Nurse. To remove the intron in cdc22, the AatII site in pET 3a was first destroyed by cutting, removing the protruding 3′-tail with T4 DNA polymerase, and religation. A synthetic linker encoding the first 9 amino acid residues in Cdc22p including an AatII site followed by an NsiI restriction site was cloned into the pET3a opened with NdeI and BamH1. A fragment lacking the intron but containing the major part of the Cdc22p coding sequence was prepared by digesting the pCDC22-1 with AatII and NsiI (cutting downstream of the stop codon) and ligating into the pET vector opened with the same restriction enzymes. The Cdc22p was expressed by growing the bacterial culture in TB medium plus 100 μg/ml of carbenicillin and 34 μg/ml of chloramphenicol at 30 °C to A600 = 2. Then the incubator was set at 15 °C, isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was added to a final concentration of 0.2 mm, and the culture was allowed to grow at 15 °C overnight. Cdc22p was purified by ammonium sulfate fractionation and affinity chromatography on dATP-Sepharose as described (12Davis R. Thelander M. Mann G.J. Behravan G. Soucy F. Beaulieu P. Lavallée P. Gräslund A. Thelander L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23171-23176Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Suc22p-expressing bacteria were grown in Luria Bertani medium containing the same antibiotics as above at 30 °C to an A600 = 0.7 when isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was added to a final concentration of 0.4 mm and the culture incubated for another 3 h at 30 °C. Suc22p was purified by streptomycin sulfate precipitation, ammonium sulfate precipitation to 50% saturation (0.295 g/ml), and chromatography on DEAE-Sepharose fast flow essentially as described earlier (13Rova U. Adrait A. Pötsch S. Gräslund A. Thelander L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23746-23751Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Instead of stepwise elution, the protein was eluted by a linear gradient of 0-500 mm NaCl in 10 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, where Suc22p eluted around 250 mm NaCl. The final Suc22p preparations contained 0.2-0.4 mol tyrosyl radical/mol of polypeptide chain. The Spd1p-expressing bacteria were grown the same way as the Suc22p-expressing bacteria but at 37 °C, and they were induced with isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside at a final concentration of 0.5 mm. After lysing the bacteria by freezing and thawing, the crude extract was centrifuged for 60 min at 45,000 rpm at 4 °C in a Beckman Ti-70 rotor, and the supernatant was discarded. The pellet was washed three times with 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, treated with DNase 1 (5 μg/ml), and dissolved in 0.1 m Tris-Cl, pH 8.5, 5 m urea. After incubation for 20 min on ice, the solution was centrifuged at 45,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C and the pellet discarded. Finally, the urea-solubilized Spd1p was refolded by instant 10× dilution in 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 100 mm potassium acetate; the remaining urea was removed by gel filtration on a Sephadex G50 column equilibrated with the same buffer. RNR Assay—Assay mixtures containing 20 mm Hepes-KOH (pH 7.3), 100 mm KOAc, 5 mm ATP, 20 mm Mg(OAc)2, 0.5 mm [3H]cytidine 5′-diphosphate (CDP; specific activity 22400 cpm/nmol), 20 μm FeCl3, 20 mm dithiothreitol, and RNR proteins in different combinations were incubated at 25 °C for 25 min in a final volume of 50 μl. After incubation, the samples were processed as described earlier to obtain the amount of dCDP formed (14Engström Y. Eriksson S. Thelander L. Åkerman M. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 2941-2948Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Molar concentrations of Cdc22p, Suc22p, and Spd1p are calculated using the monomer molecular weights of 92,000, 45,400, and 14,200, respectively. BIAcore Biosensor Analysis—The interaction between Spd1p and Cdc22p, Suc22p, budding yeast Rnr1p, Sml1p, and mouse R1 protein was studied by biosensor analysis using a BIAcore 2000 (Biacore International AB). The Spd1p was prepared in 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, at a concentration of 0.07 mg/ml; it was then immobilized on a CM5 sensor chip (BIAcore) as described earlier (15Rova U. Goodtzova K. Ingemarson R. Behravan G. Gräslund A. Thelander L. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 4267-4275Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Immobilization of the budding yeast Sml1p was made as in Ref. 16Chabes A. Domkin V. Thelander L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36679-36683Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar. All ligand proteins were equilibrated with running buffer (10 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.4, 200 mm KOAc, 1 mm EDTA, 5 mm MgOAc, and 0.005% Surfactant P 20 (BIAcore). The interactions were studied at a constant temperature of 20 °C and a constant flow of 70 μl/min. Kinetics for the interaction of Spd1p with Cdc22p was determined by allowing the immobilized Spd1p to interact with increasing concentrations of Cdc22p (17Ingemarson R. Thelander L. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 8603-8609Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Between each injection, bound protein was removed by washing with 5 μl of 5 mm NaOH. The resonance unit (RU) is proportional to the mass, and 1 RU corresponds to a surface concentration of 1 pg of protein/mm2 of the CM5 sensor chip (18Jönsson U. Fägerstam L. Ivarsson B. Johnsson B.

Determination of NTP and dNTP Pools by HPLC—Cells were harvested by filtration through 25-mm White AAWP nitrocellulose filters (0.8 μm; Millipore) that were immediately immersed in ice-cold extraction solution (10% w/v trichloroacetic acid, 15 mm MgCl2) (10Chabes A. Georgieva B. Domkin V. Zhao X. Rothstein R. Thelander L. Cell. 2003; 112: 391-401Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar). Separation and quantitation of dNTPs and NTPs using HPLC were carried out as described in Ref. 19Hofer A. Ekanem J.T. Thelander L. J. Biol.

To improve the sensitivity, we used a Poly WAX LP, 200 × 4.6 mm, 5-μm, 300-E column (PolyLC Inc.) instead of the Partisphere SAX-5 column. The column was run isocratically in 0.29 m potassium phosphate buffer, pH 5.0, 2% (v/v) acetonitrile at 1.0 ml/min. Expression and Purification of Recombinant S. pombe Cdc22p, Suc22p, and Spd1p—The results from an SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis of our highly purified recombinant S. pombe proteins are shown in Fig. 1. Unexpectedly, the 124-amino acid residue Spd1p formed almost exclusively inclusion bodies when expressed at 37 °C. Initially, we therefore grew the bacteria at 20 °C for 3 h after isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside induction, which resulted in soluble protein. However, the yield was much better and the purity of the final preparation higher when we expressed Spd1p as inclusion bodies followed by solubilization in urea and rapid dilution into urea-free buffer (Fig. 1). The soluble and the solubilized forms of Spd1p both showed the same capacity to inhibit the S. pombe RNR system in vitro (data not shown). The lack of cysteine residues in Spd1p may explain the stability of the protein. Properties of the S. pombe RNR System—Electron paramagnetic resonance analysis of the highly purified Suc22p showed that it contained a tyrosyl free radical giving a signal similar to the EPR signal of the mouse RNR R2 protein or the Rnr2p of Saccharomyces cerevisiae (data not shown). The specific activity of Cdc22p assayed at 25 °C in the presence of an excess of Suc22p was ∼10 nmol dCDP/mg of protein/min, and the specific activity of Suc22p assayed at 25 °C in the presence of an excess of Cdc22p was ∼400 nmol dCDP/mg of protein/min. These specific activities are closer to the values of the mouse RNR R1 and R2 proteins, 130 and 280, respectively, assayed at 37 °C (12Davis R. Thelander M. Mann G.J. Behravan G. Soucy F. Beaulieu P.

Thelander L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 2474-2479Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Like other class 1 RNRs, the S. pombe enzyme is feedback inhibited by dATP with a 50% inhibition of the 5-mm ATP-stimulated reaction at 40 μm dATP. Inhibition by Spd1p—Recombinant Cdc22p plus Suc22p was assayed for activity using the CDP reduction assay, with ATP as a positive effector in the presence of increasing amounts of Spd1 protein (Fig. 2). Under these conditions 50% inhibition was already observed at 1 μm concentration of Spd1p. The inhibition was highly specific for S. pombe RNR because very little inhibition was observed when Spd1p was added to an assay system containing Rnr1p plus Rnr2p/Rnr4p of S. cerevisiae or an assay system containing mouse R1 plus R2 proteins (data not shown). To differentiate between inhibition of Suc22p and Cdc22p activity by Spd1p, we took advantage of the observation that budding yeast Rnr1p forms an active RNR complex with fission yeast Suc22p, although the amino acid sequence identity is only 66% between Rnr1p and Cdc22p. Assaying recombinant budding yeast Rnr1p plus Suc22p for activity using the CDP reduction assay in the presence of increasing amounts of Spd1 protein showed very little inhibition compared with the results with Cdc22p and Suc22p (Fig. 2). Because Spd1 is a very weak inhibitor of the budding yeast RNR, these results strongly indicate that Spd1 inhibits the fission yeast RNR by specifically interacting with Cdc22p. To find out more about the inhibition mechanism, we prepared a series of assay tubes containing a fixed amount of Cdc22p (85 pmol) and increasing amounts of Suc22p with and without a constant amount of Spd1p (90 pmol) (Fig. 3A). In the absence of added Spd1p, the activity increased with increasing amounts of Suc22p up to 330 pmol, when a plateau was reached. Addition of Spd1 resulted in an almost constant inhibition in all tubes of ∼80%. We then prepared another series of assay tubes containing a fixed amount of Suc22p (10 pmol) and increasing amounts of Cdc22p with and without a constant amount of Spd1 (50 pmol) (Fig. 3B). The activity increased with increasing amounts of Cdc22p in the absence of Spd1 to reach a plateau at ∼300 pmol protein. In the presence of Spd1p, there was an initial inhibition of ∼50%, but this inhibition decreased to 10% on the addition of increasing amounts of Cdc22p. These results again supported that Spd1p mainly inhibits the Cdc22p activity and not the Suc22p activity. Kinetic Studies of the Interaction between the Cdc22p, Suc22p, and Spd1p Using a Biosensor Technique—To determine whether Spd1p interacts with Cdc22p, Suc22p, or both, we immobilized the Spd1 protein to a dextran layer on a sensor chip and then injected a series of solutions containing increasing concentrations of Cdc22p or Suc22p to the same sensor chip. The immobilization of Spd1p at a concentration of 0.07 mg/ml gave an increase of 200 RU, which corresponds to 200 pg/mm2. With a surface of 0.8 mm2, 200 RU corresponds to a total of 160 pg of bound Spd1p, which can be compared with the total injected amount of 210 ng. This low degree of attachment (only 0.08%) makes it unlikely that the Spd1p is attached to multiple binding sites. Injection of increasing concentrations of Cdc22p resulted in increasing equilibrium values (Fig. 4A). A Scatchard plot of the response at equilibrium of increasing concentrations of Cdc22p interacting with a constant amount of immobilized Spd1p gave an equilibrium dissociation constant KD of 2.4 μm and a maximal binding of 0.43 mol Cdc22p monomer/mol of immobilized Spd1p (data not shown). Injection of Suc22p resulted in very low binding; low binding was also observed after the injection of S. cerevisiae Rnr1p or mouse R1 protein (Fig. 4A). Injection of an equimolar solution of Cdc22p and Suc22p resulted in a small but reproducible decrease in equilibrium value compared with the injection of Cdc22p alone. Addition of 0.1 mm dTTP to the injection mixture, known to induce dimerization of the large subunit of mouse and budding yeast RNR (16Chabes A. Domkin V. Thelander L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36679-36683Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), had no major effect on the sensorgram. As a comparison we immobilized S. cerevisiae Sml1p to a sensor chip (Fig. 4B). Injection of S. cerevisiae Rnr1p resulted in an efficient binding, whereas injection of Cdc22p or Suc22p gave no significant binding. Changes in Deoxyribonucleoside Triphosphate Pools in Fission Yeast after DNA Damage and during the Cell Cycle—Budding yeast regulates RNR activity during DNA replication and repair by binding of the low molecular weight protein inhibitor Sml1p to Rnr1p (16Chabes A. Domkin V. Thelander L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36679-36683Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 23Zhao X. Muller E.G. Rothstein R. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 329-340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (601) Google Scholar). When budding yeast enters S-phase or after DNA damage, Sml1p is degraded, releasing RNR from inhibition and resulting in elevated dNTP pools (10Chabes A. Georgieva B. Domkin V. Zhao X. Rothstein R. Thelander L. Cell. 2003; 112: 391-401Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar, 23Zhao X. Muller E.G. Rothstein R. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 329-340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (601) Google Scholar, 24Zhao X. Chabes A. Domkin V. Thelander L. Rothstein R. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 3544-3553Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). It was reported that Ddb1/Csn1/Csn2/Cullin 4-mediated degradation of Spd1p is essential for DNA replication and repair in fission yeast and that deletion of Ddb1 led to decreased dNTP pools in undamaged cells (4Liu C. Powell K.A. Mundt K. Wu L. Carr A.M. Caspari T. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 1130-1140Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 8Holmberg C. Fleck O. Hansen H.A. Liu C. Slaaby R. Carr A.M. Nielsen O. Genes Dev. 2005; 19: 853-862Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Because Spd1p similar to Sml1p specifically inhibits RNR, we were interested to study whether and to what extent DNA damage affected the dNTP pools in logarithmically growing fission yeast. Like budding yeast (10Chabes A. Georgieva B. Domkin V. Zhao X. Rothstein R. Thelander L. Cell. 2003; 112: 391-401Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar), an increase in dNTP pools was already observed 1 h after the addition of 1 mg/liter of 4-nitroquinoline-N-oxide (4-NQO), a mutagen that acts as a UV mimetic (25Friedberg E.C. Walker G.C. Siede W. DNA Repair and Mutagenesis. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D.C.1995: 42Google Scholar), and after 3 h all four dNTP pools showed a 2-fold increase (Fig. 5B). Separate experiments using 0.2mg/liter of 4-NQO indicated that maximal pool increase was obtained at 1 mg/liter (data not shown). Flow cytometry of the culture before and 3 h after the addition of 4-NQO showed a small increase in G1 cells and a small decrease in the number of S-phase cells after drug addition (Fig. 5A). To be able to relate this DNA damage-induced dNTP pool increase to the dNTP levels in fission yeast during the cell cycle, we measured the pools in temperature-sensitive cdc10 mutant cells shifted to 25 °C after 4 h of synchronization at 36 °C. Cells were harvested for flow cytometry and dNTP pool determinations 0, 45, 60, 75, and 90 min after the downshift in incubation temperature. A 2-fold increase in all dNTP pools was observed when the 0-min sample was compared with the 90-min sample (Fig. 5D). Flow cytometry showed that the cells were blocked in G1 after 4 h at the restrictive temperature, proceeded into S-phase after 45 min at 25 °C, and after 90 min the majority of the cells had a DNA content >1C indicative of being in or just after S-phase (Fig. 5C). The dNTP pool increase observed in logarithmically growing wt cells after the addition of 4-NQO (Fig. 5B) was similar to the increase observed in 4-NQO-treated logarithmically growing cdc10 cells. We have demonstrated in in vitro assays using highly purified proteins that Spd1p is an efficient inhibitor of fission yeast ribonucleotide reductase. However, in strong contrast to the model proposed by Liu et al. (4Liu C. Powell K.A. Mundt K. Wu L. Carr A.M. Caspari T. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 1130-1140Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar), biosensor technique showed that Spd1p has no affinity for the Suc22p but instead binds the Cdc22p with a KD of 2.4 μm. The binding data are in full agreement with data from inhibition assays with the homologous Cdc22p/Suc22p system and the heterologous Rnr1p/Suc22p system where significant inhibition was only observed in the system containing Cdc22p. Therefore, it is highly unlikely that Spd1p acts by anchoring Suc22p inside the nucleus during the G1 phase of the cell cycle as was proposed. Instead, our results are in agreement with the demonstration by Borgne and Nurse (2Borgne A. Nurse P. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 4341-4350Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) that Spd1p is mainly localized in the cytoplasm where it can directly control RNR activity by binding to the Cdc22p. Liu et al. (4Liu C. Powell K.A. Mundt K. Wu L. Carr A.M. Caspari T. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 1130-1140Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar) observed that loss of spd1 phenocopied suc22 overexpression in csn1-d cells and interpreted their data to mean that Spd1p directly acted on Suc22p. However, as clearly seen in Fig. 3, the low affinity between the two subunits of fission yeast RNR, Cdc22p and Suc22p, similar to most type I RNRs, results in increased enzyme activity independent of which subunit is overexpressed when one subunit is present in low amounts. Our results emphasize the similarities between the RNR systems in fission and budding yeast in that both regulate RNR activity during DNA replication and repair by a low molecular weight protein inhibitor, Spd1p and Sml1p, respectively (4Liu C. Powell K.A. Mundt K. Wu L. Carr A.M. Caspari T. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 1130-1140Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 16Chabes A. Domkin V. Thelander L. J. Biol.

Cell. 1998; 2: 329-340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (601) Google Scholar). There is no sequence homology between the two inhibitors, and in the case of Sml1p, deletion of amino acid residues 2-50 from the total 104 amino acid residues had very little effect on the inhibition efficiency (26Zhao X. Georgieva B. Chabes A. Domkin V. Ippel J. Schleucher J. Wijmenga S. Thelander L. Rothstein R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 9076-9083Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). In contrast, deletion of the first 29 amino acid residues from the total 124 amino acid residues in Spd1p resulted in a protein much less effective in causing cell cycle arrest when overexpressed than the intact protein (1Woollard A. Basi G. Nurse P. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4603-4612Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Sml1p is a target of the Mec1/Rad 53 kinase cascade, and its degradation after DNA damage is initiated by phosphorylation by the Dun1 kinase at serine 56, serine 58, and serine 60 (24Zhao X. Chabes A. Domkin V. Thelander L. Rothstein R. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 3544-3553Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar, 27Uchiki T. Dice L.T. Hettich R.L. Dealwis C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 279: 11293-11303Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). In fission yeast, Ddb1, Cullin4, and the signalosome subunits Csn1 and Csn2 are required for the degradation of Spd1p (4Liu C. Powell K.A. Mundt K. Wu L. Carr A.M. Caspari T. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 1130-1140Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 8Holmberg C. Fleck O. Hansen H.A. Liu C. Slaaby R. Carr A.M. Nielsen O. Genes Dev. 2005; 19: 853-862Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 9Liu C. Poitelea M. Watson A. Yoshida S. Shimoda C. Holmberg C. Nielsen O. Carr A.M. EMBO J. 2005; (in press)Google Scholar), but up to now, no phosphorylation of Spd1p has been demonstrated. Inability to degrade Sml1p during S-phase or after DNA damage in budding yeast results in decreased dNTP levels, incomplete DNA replication, defective mitochondrial DNA propagation, and cell death (24Zhao X. Chabes A. Domkin V. Thelander L. Rothstein R. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 3544-3553Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). Likewise, the inability to degrade Spd1p in fission yeast results in decreased dNTP levels, increased mutation rate, slow S-phase progression, and inability to enter meiosis because of blocked premeiotic S-phase (1Woollard A. Basi G. Nurse P. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4603-4612Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 4Liu C. Powell K.A. Mundt K. Wu L. Carr A.M. Caspari T. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 1130-1140Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 8Holmberg C. Fleck O. Hansen H.A. Liu C. Slaaby R. Carr A.M. Nielsen O. Genes Dev. 2005; 19: 853-862Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The exact mechanism by which Spd1/Sml1 inhibits RNR activity is still unknown, but our results from in vitro assays indicate that there is no simple competition between Spd1/Sml1 and the small RNR subunit for binding to the large subunit (16Chabes A. Domkin V. Thelander L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36679-36683Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). In both budding and fission yeast, regulation of export of the small subunit from the nucleus to the cytoplasmatically localized large subunit was suggested to regulate RNR activity during S-phase and after DNA damage (4Liu C. Powell K.A. Mundt K. Wu L. Carr A.M. Caspari T. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 1130-1140Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 28Yao R. Zhang Z. An X. Bucci B. Perlstein D.L. Stubbe J. Huang M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 6628-6633Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). In mammalian cells, both RNR subunits were demonstrated to be localized to the cytoplasm during the cell cycle (29Engström Y. Rozell B. Hansson H.A. Stemme S. Thelander L. EMBO J. 1984; 3: 863-867Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 30Engström Y. Rozell B. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 1615-1620Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). In contrast, the p53-inducible small subunit homologue, p53R2, was translocated from the cytoplasm to the nucleus after DNA damage (31Tanaka H. Arakawa H. Yamaguchi T. Shiraishi K. Fukuda S. Matsui K. Takei Y. Nakamura Y. Nature. 2000; 404: 42-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (745) Google Scholar). Our present results do not exclude transport of the small RNR subunit from the nucleus to the cytoplasm as a mechanism to regulate RNR activity in yeast cells. In budding yeast, DNA damage was shown to increase the dNTP pools 6-8-fold, which resulted in dNTP levels 3-5-fold higher than the dNTP pools in untreated synchronized S-phase cells (10Chabes A. Georgieva B. Domkin V. Zhao X. Rothstein R. Thelander L. Cell. 2003; 112: 391-401Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar). This increase is possible because of a relaxed dATP feedback inhibition of budding yeast RNR. Even further increased pools strongly improved survival following DNA damage, but they also led to higher mutation rates. The fission yeast RNR shows a 50% feedback inhibition at 40 μm dATP compared with 10 and 80 μm for the mouse and budding yeast enzyme, respectively, all assayed in the presence of 5 mm ATP (10Chabes A. Georgieva B. Domkin V. Zhao X. Rothstein R. Thelander L. Cell. 2003; 112: 391-401Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar, 21Domkin V. Thelander L. Chabes A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 18574-18578Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). This relatively tight dATP feedback inhibition of the fission yeast RNR may be one explanation why the dNTP pools in logarithmically growing fission yeast only increased ∼2-fold after DNA damage. Also, the fluctuations during the cell cycle are much less pronounced in fission yeast than in budding yeast, an ∼2-fold increase for all dNTPs in fission yeast compared with a 6-fold increase in the purine dNTPs and a 3-fold increase in the pyrimidine dNTPs during S-phase in budding yeast (10Chabes A. Georgieva B. Domkin V. Zhao X. Rothstein R. Thelander L. Cell. 2003; 112: 391-401Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar, 32Koç A. Wheeler L.J. Mathews C.K. Merill G.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 9345-9352Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). How does the regulation of RNR activity in fission and budding yeast compare with the regulation in mammalian cells? Common for all three organisms is that a failure to provide sufficient and balanced dNTP pools can lead to misincorporation of dNTPs into DNA, resulting in genetic abnormalities and cell death. So far, no low molecular weight protein inhibitor of the mammalian RNR has been identified, but the small size and the very low amino acid sequence conservation between Spd1p and Sml1p make it difficult to identify such an inhibitor in mammalian genome sequences. There are conflicting results in the literature regarding the effects of DNA damage on dNTP pools in mammalian cells (33Kunz B.A. Kohalmi S.E. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1991; 25: 339-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). However, recent data from our laboratory show that mammalian cells do not increase their dNTP pools after DNA damage and still the dNTP pools in G1 cells are only 1/20 of the pools in S-phase cells, 3P. Håkansson, A. Hofer, and L. Thelander, manuscript in preparation. indicating a regulation different from the regulation in yeast. We thank Christopher J.

https://openalex.org/W2004477493,"The role of the presumptive phosphatidylserine receptor (PSR) in the recognition and engulfment of apoptotic cells, and the antiinflammatory response they exert, has been of great interest. Genetic deficiency of PSR in the mouse is lethal perinatally, and results to date have been ambiguous with regard to the phagocytic and inflammatory phenotypes associated with that deficiency. Recently, we found that the specific functional recognition of apoptotic cells is a ubiquitous property of virtually all cell types, including mouse embryo fibroblasts, and reflects an innate immunity that discriminates live from effete cells. Taking advantage of this property of fibroblasts, we generated, PSR+/+, PSR+/-, and PSR-/- fibroblast cell lines to examine definitively the involvement of PSR in apoptotic recognition and inflammatory modulation. Our data demonstrate that PSR-deficient cells are fully competent to recognize, engulf, and respond to apoptotic cells. Signal transduction in the responder cells, including the activation of Akt and Rac1, is unimpaired in the absence of PSR. We confirm as well that PSR is localized predominantly to the nucleus. However, it does not play a role in pro-inflammatory transcription or in the anti-inflammatory modulation of that transcriptional response triggered by apoptotic cells. We conclude that PSR is not involved generally in either specific innate recognition or engulfment of apoptotic cells.

We conclude that PSR is not involved generally in either specific innate recognition or engulfment of apoptotic cells. Physiological cell death is a process whose purpose is the elimination of functionally inappropriate cells in a manner that does not elicit inflammation. The ability of apoptotic corpses to be cleared in a noninflammatory manner by phagocytes is a consequence of their specific expression of determinants for recognition and modulation of pro-inflammatory responses. The acquisition of these apoptotic determinants is a gain-of-function common to all physiological cell deaths, without regard to suicidal stimulus, and conserved widely across species (1Cocco R.E. Ucker D.S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 919-930Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 2Cvetanovic M. Ucker D.S. J.

It still remains to be determined what specific molecular events are responsible for the recognition of the effete cell.The view that externalized PS serves as a ligand for macrophage recognition of apoptotic cells followed from studies demonstrating that similar changes target aged erythrocytes for clearance (6Schroit A.J. Madsen J.W. Tanaka Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 5131-5138Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7McEvoy L. Williamson P. Schlegel R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Bratton D.L. Rose D.M. Pearson A. Ezekowitz R.A.B. Henson P.M. Nature. 2000; 405: 85-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (1247) Google Scholar). The product of that screen, mAb 217, bound to cell surface determinants on macrophages and other cell types, notably excluding lymphoid cells. Significantly, mAb 217 triggered macrophages to release the anti-inflammatory cytokine TGFβ, further suggesting that mAb 217 engaged an apoptotic-like recognition mechanism (10Fadok V.A. Bratton D.L. Rose D.M. Pearson A. Ezekowitz R.A.B. Henson P.M. Nature. 2000; 405: 85-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (1247) Google Scholar).Controversy regarding this presumptive receptor arose, however, when PSR was observed to localize to the nucleus in mammalian cells (11Cui P. Qin B. Liu N. Pan G. Pei D. Exp. Cell Res. 2004; 293: 154-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) as well as in Hydra (12Cikala M. Alexandrova O. David C.N. Pröschel M. Stiening B. Cramer P. Böttger A. BMC Cell Biol. 2004; 5: 26Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The role of PSR has been further clouded by the disparate results of three groups of investigators who independently generated mice with targeted disruptions of the PSR locus (13Li M.O. Sarkisian M.R. Mehal W.Z. Rakic P. Flavell R.A. Science. 2003; 302: 1560-1563Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar, 14Kunisaki Y. Masuko S. Noda M. Inayoshi A. Sanui T. Harada M. Sasazuki T.

While homozygous PSR disruptions result in perinatal lethality in each case, different effects on the phagocytosis of apoptotic cells have been reported for the three PSR deficiencies.Li et al. (13Li M.O. Sarkisian M.R. Mehal W.Z. Rakic P. Flavell R.A. Science. 2003; 302: 1560-1563Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar) described a disruption beginning upstream of exon 1 (which includes the translational start site of the PSR gene product) and extending through exon 2, in a mixed 129 × C57BL/6 background, which leads to severe lung defects as well as less penetrant brain aberrations. Kunisaki et al. (14Kunisaki Y. Masuko S. Noda M. Inayoshi A. Sanui T. Harada M. Sasazuki T. Fukui Y. Blood. 2004; 103: 3362-3364Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) generated a disruption, also starting upstream of exon 1 and extending into exon 3, in a chimeric 129 × C57BL/6 background, which results in defective erythroid differentiation and severe anemia. The disruption generated by Böse et al. (15Böse J. Gruber A.D. Helming L. Schiebe S. Wegener I. Hafner M. Beales M. Köntgen F. Lengeling A. J. Biol. 2004; 3: 15.1-15.18Crossref Google Scholar) in a pure C57BL/6 background is limited to exons 1 and 2 and leads to growth retardation, defects in embryonic lung, kidney, gut, and erythroid development, and, at low frequency, aberrant eye and brain development. Hemizygous PSR deficiency has no phenotype in any of these cases.An increased number of apoptotic cells (with digested genomic DNA, identified by TUNEL (terminal deoxyribonucleotidyltransferase end labeling) staining) was observed by Li et al. (13Li M.O. Sarkisian M.R. Mehal W.Z. Rakic P. Flavell R.A.

Interestingly, Kunisaki et al. (14Kunisaki Y. Masuko S. Noda M. Inayoshi A. Sanui T. Harada M. Sasazuki T. Fukui Y.

Their data are confounded, however, by an apparent reduction in the number of tissue-resident macrophages (stained with F4/80 antibody; Ref. 16Austyn J.M. Gordon S. Eur. J. Immunol. 1981; 11: 805-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (1278) Google Scholar), hinting at another possible developmental impairment related to PSR deficiency. Li et al. (13Li M.O. Sarkisian M.R. Mehal W.Z. Rakic P. Flavell R.A. Science. 2003; 302: 1560-1563Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar) further explored engulfment in vitro with PSR-deficient macrophages generated by adoptive transfer of PSR-/- fetal liver into wild-type hosts. They reported a 50% overall reduction and a complete absence of PS-inhibitable engulfment by PSR-deficient elicited macrophages. In light of the observations of Kunisaki et al. (14Kunisaki Y. Masuko S. Noda M. Inayoshi A. Sanui T. Harada M. Sasazuki T. Fukui Y. Blood. 2004; 103: 3362-3364Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), it is important to note that the differentiation and activation states of these PSR-/- and PSR+/+ macrophages were not compared; previous work has suggested that PS-inhibitable engulfment pertains particularly to activated macrophages (8Pradhan D. Krahling S. Williamson P. Schlegel R.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 767-778Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 9Fadok V.A. Warner M.L. Bratton D.L. Henson P.M. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 6250-6257PubMed Google Scholar). In marked contrast to the results of Li et al. (13Li M.O. Sarkisian M.R. Mehal W.Z. Rakic P. Flavell R.A. Science. 2003; 302: 1560-1563Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar) and Kunisaki et al. (14Kunisaki Y. Masuko S. Noda M. Inayoshi A. Sanui T. Harada M. Sasazuki T. Fukui Y. Blood. 2004; 103: 3362-3364Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), extensive histological analysis of numerous tissues by Böse et al. (15Böse J. Gruber A.D. Helming L. Schiebe S. Wegener I. Hafner M. Beales M. Köntgen F. Lengeling A. J. Biol. 2004; 3: 15.1-15.18Crossref Google Scholar) revealed no defects in the phagocytosis of apoptotic (TUNEL+) cells. Their in vitro phagocytosis studies with fetal liver-derived macrophages (differentiated in culture) also showed no engulfment defect of PSR-deficient macrophages. Of great significance, Böse et al. (15Böse J. Gruber A.D. Helming L. Schiebe S. Wegener I. Hafner M. Beales M. Köntgen F. Lengeling A. J. Biol. 2004; 3: 15.1-15.18Crossref Google Scholar) reported that the ability of apoptotic cells to trigger an antiinflammatory response in engulfing macrophages (both the inhibition of secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as TNFα, and the induction of anti-inflammatory cytokines, such as TGFβ and IL-10) was unimpaired in the absence of PSR expression.Our studies of the process of apoptotic cell clearance have demonstrated that the ability of apoptotic corpses to be engulfed specifically and in a non-inflammatory manner by macrophages and other phagocytes is a consequence of a process of specific recognition and modulation of pro-inflammatory phagocyte responses (1Cocco R.E. Ucker D.S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 919-930Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). The modulatory effect of the apoptotic corpse is manifest as an immediate-early inhibition of pro-inflammatory cytokine gene transcription within the responding phagocyte with which it interacts, and is exerted upon binding, independent of subsequent engulfment or soluble factor involvement (2Cvetanovic M. Ucker D.S. J. Immunol. 2004; 172: 880-889Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Cells that die pathologically (that is, necrotic corpses) also are recognized by phagocytes but do not down-regulate inflammatory responses. The recognition of these two classes of native dying cells occurs via distinct and non-competing mechanisms (1Cocco R.E. Ucker D.S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 919-930Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar).Importantly, non-professional phagocytes are fully capable of noninflammatory recognition and clearance of apoptotic cells. 5M. Cvetanovic, J. E. Mitchell, V. Patel, B. S. Avner, Y. Su, P. T. van der Saag, P. L. Witte, S. Fiore, J. S. Levine, and D. S. Ucker, submitted for publication. 5M. Cvetanovic, J. E. Mitchell, V. Patel, B. S. Avner, Y. Su, P. T. van der Saag, P. L. Witte, S. Fiore, J. S. Levine, and D. S. Ucker, submitted for publication. Indeed, we have found that the specific functional recognition of apoptotic cells is a ubiquitous property of virtually all cell types, including non-phagocytic lymphocytes, and reflects an innate immunity that discriminates live from effete cells without regard to self (2Cvetanovic M. Ucker D.S. J. Immunol. 2004; 172: 880-889Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). 5M. Cvetanovic, J. E. Mitchell, V. Patel, B. S. Avner, Y. Su, P. T. van der Saag, P. L. Witte, S. Fiore, J. S. Levine, and D. S. Ucker, submitted for publication. In particular, the ability of fibroblastic cells to respond to apoptotic corpses permits mouse embryo fibroblasts established from animals with targeted disruptions of genes of interest (including essential genes) to be used in the evaluation of genetic contributions to apoptotic recognition and response without the generation or selection of particular cell populations.We have applied this analysis to embryo fibroblasts that harbor a disruption of the PSR locus. Our data, which demonstrate that PSR-deficient cells are fully competent to recognize apoptotic cells, definitively exclude a general role for PSR in apoptotic recognition and inflammatory modulation.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCells and Death Induction—Immortalized murine fibroblast cell lines were derived from mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEFs) following the 3T3 protocol of Todaro and Green (17Todaro G.J. Green H. J. Cell Biol. 1963; 17: 299-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (1993) Google Scholar). Briefly, MEFs were cultured at 37 °C in a humidified, 5% (v/v) CO2 atmosphere in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium with 4.5 g/liter glucose (Mediatech, Herndon, VA) supplemented with fetal bovine serum (10% v/v; HyClone Laboratories, Logan, UT), 2mml-glutamine, and 50 μm 2-mercaptoethanol, replating at 3 × 105/60-mm diameter dish every 3 days. Immortalized cell lines were established from cells that grew from cultures that had become senescent.NIH 3T3 cells were maintained similarly. 293T human transformed kidney epithelial cells were grown in the same medium without 2-mercaptoethanol, and DO11.10 murine T hybridoma and CEM human T lymphoblastoid cells were grown in RPMI 1640 medium (Mediatech) supplemented with heat inactivated fetal bovine serum (10% v/v), 2 mml-glutamine, and 50 μm 2-mercaptoethanol.Physiological cell death (apoptosis) was induced by treatment of target cells with the macromolecular synthesis inhibitor actinomycin D (200 ng/ml, 12 h; Ref. 18Chang S.H. Cvetanovic M. Harvey K.J. Komoriya A. Packard B.Z. Ucker D.S. Exp. Cell Res. 2002; 277: 15-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) or with UV-B irradiation (20 mJ/cm2). Cells were killed pathologically (necrotic death) by incubation at 55 °C for 20 min (until trypan blue uptake indicated compromise of membrane integrity; Ref. 1Cocco R.E. Ucker D.S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 919-930Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). In all cases, target cells (viable, apoptotic, and necrotic) were washed twice in PBS or complete medium before addition to experimental cultures.Reverse Transcriptase (RT)-PCR Analysis—PSR expression on the level of transcripts was evaluated by RT-PCR analysis. Total cellular RNA was isolated using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). cDNA synthesis and PCR were performed sequentially using the SuperScript One-Step RT-PCR with Platinum Taq kit (Invitrogen). For the PSR-specific reaction, the forward primer was 5′-CAAGACGGTAAGAGGGAGACC-3′ (nucleotides 1086-1106, within exon 4), and the reverse primer was 5′-GTCACCTGGAGGAGCTGCG-3′ (complementary to nucleotides 1402-1384, within exon 6), yielding a product of 276 bp. As a control for RNA integrity, transcripts of constitutively expressed glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase were assessed in parallel, using forward (5′-CCATGGAGAAGGCTGGGG-3′) and reverse (5′-CAAAGTTGTCATGGATGACC-3′) primers, generating a 188-bp product from 5′ end of the mRNA.Phagocytosis Assay—Phagocytosis by 3T3 fibroblasts was assessed as previously described for macrophages (2Cvetanovic M. Ucker D.S. J. Immunol. 2004; 172: 880-889Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Target cells were labeled green with 5 (and 6)-carboxyfluorescein diacetate succinimidyl ester (CFDA; 0.2 μm; Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) and were then induced to undergo cell death, killed by heat treatment, or left untreated. 3T3 cells were labeled red with 5 (and 6)-(((4-chloromethyl)benzoyl)amino)-tetramethylrhodamine (CMTMR; 10 μm; Molecular Probes). In all cases, cells were labeled on the day preceding the experiment and cultured in serum-containing medium overnight to eliminate unbound label. Labeled 3T3 cells were co-cultured with the apoptotic, necrotic, or viable target cells for 30 min at 37 °C. Cells were harvested with PBS supplemented with 0.4 mm Na2EDTA and analyzed cytofluorimetrically on a FacsCaliber instrument (BD Biosciences). Cells with 3T3-like scatter properties that were both CMTMR-positive (λEx = 488 nm, λEm = 610 nm ± 15 nm) and CFDA-positive (λEx = 488 nm; λEm = 530 ± 15 nm) represented 3T3 cells that had engulfed targets. Engulfment is calculated as the fraction of double-positive 3T3 fibroblasts (all CMTMR-positive cells that also are CFDA-positive). Targets that are bound but not engulfed are disrupted and do not remain adherent during the analysis.Phagocytosis by transfected 293T cells was assayed similarly, employing a green fluorescent protein (GFP) marker expressed from a bicistronic vector to label the phagocytes green in place of CFDA. 293T cells were transfected with pIRES-2-PSR, pCX-β5 (which includes the same cytomegalovirus promoter/internal ribosome entry site (IRES) structure), or empty pIRES-2 vector (19Albert M.L. Kim J.I. Birge R.B. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 899-905Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). Target cells were labeled red with PKH26-GL red fluorescent cell linker kit (Sigma). 48 h after transfection, the 293T cells were co-cultured with labeled apoptotic cells for 2 h at 37 °C and analyzed as above.Transfections and Luciferase Assays—Apoptoticmodulation of NFκB-dependent transcription was assessed using a dual luciferase strategy, as described previously (2Cvetanovic M. Ucker D.S. J. Immunol. 2004; 172: 880-889Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). We found that routine transfection protocols for 3T3 cells triggered high levels of cell death and NFκB activation (“transfection stress”). A transfection protocol that was reasonably efficient (∼40% viable cell transfection, as measured in parallel with farnesylated GFP as a transfection marker; Ref. 20Harvey K.J. Lukovic D. Ucker D.S. Cytometry. 2001; 43: 273-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) and minimally stressful (i.e. low spontaneous NFκB activation) was selected.3T3 cells were transfected using the MEF1 Nucleofector Kit (AMAXA Biosystems, Gaithersburg, MD), with “MEF Nucleofector Solution 1” and a machine setting of “A-23.” 2 × 106 3T3 fibroblasts were transfected with 4.5 μg of pNFκB-Luc, a plasmid containing the firefly (Photinus pyralis) luciferase gene, the expression of which is driven by a basal transcriptional promoter linked to four copies of the κB motif (Clontech Laboratories; Palo Alto, CA), together with 0.5 μg of pRL-SV40, a Renilla (sea pansy; Renilla reniformis) luciferase control vector, the constant expression of which is dependent on the SV40 early enhancer/promoter region (Promega, Madison, WI). Transfected cells were cultured overnight in 100-mm diameter dishes and replated the following day into 24-well plates at 1 × 105 cells/2 ml/well. After culturing a further 24 h, transfected cells were incubated without or with the indicated target cells (at a target cell:fibroblast ratio of 10:1) and/or IL-1β (5 ng/ml; R&D Systems; Minneapolis, MN) or TNFα (10 ng/ml; R&D Systems) for 12 h.Cell extracts were prepared, and luciferase activities were measured by the Dual Luciferase Reporter Assay System (Promega) in an FB12 Luminometer (Zylux, Oak Ridge, TN). Each condition was repeated in triplicate wells, and the luciferase activities in cells from each well were determined independently. The firefly luciferase activity in each sample was normalized with respect to the internal Renilla luciferase activity, and the relative level of normalized firefly luciferase activity compared with the activity in an untreated population was taken as a measure of NFκB-dependent transcriptional activity.For other studies involving transfection, routine methods were employed. NIH 3T3 cells were transfected with Lipofectamine 2000 Transfection Reagent (Qiagen, Valencia, CA), and 293T cells were transfected using Effectene Transfection Reagent (Qiagen).Intracellular Immunostaining—5 × 104 NIH 3T3 cells were plated on poly-d-lysine-coated cover slips and transfected with epitope-tagged PSR constructs (either N-terminal HA-PSR in pRK or C-terminal PSR-V5-His in pcDNA3.1). 24 h post-transfection, the cells were fixed with paraformaldehyde (5% in PBS). The cells then were permeabilized with Triton X-100 (0.1% in PBS) for 5 min and incubated for 1 h with anti-HA (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) or anti-V5 (Invitrogen) antibodies (diluted in PBS + 0.1% gelatin). After four washes (5 min each) in PBS + 0.1% gelatin, the cells were stained with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG antibody and rhodamine-conjugated phalloidin (Molecular Probes). After several further washes, the coverslips were dried and mounted with mounting medium (ProLong Antifade Kit; Molecular Probes). The cells were visualized by epifluorescence microscopy.Cellular Extract Preparation and Immunoblot Analysis—PSR expression was assessed in unmanipulated 3T3 cells by immunoblotting. Activation of Akt and inhibition of extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1 and 2 (ERK1/2) were assessed in 3T3 cells cultured overnight in serum-free medium and left unstimulated or stimulated for 15 min with a 5-fold excess of apoptotic DO11.10 cells (the apoptotic cells, which had been cultured under serum-free conditions, were centrifuged briefly onto the adherent 3T3 cells to initiate the interaction) and/or subsequent stimulation with epidermal growth factor (10 nm; Calbiochem). After washing, cell extracts were prepared from the adherent 3T3 cells. Cells were lysed in lysis buffer 1 (150 mm NaCl, 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 1.5 mm MgCl2,1mm EGTA, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 200 μm orthovanadate). Lysates were centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C and the supernatants stored at -70 °C.Protein samples (20 μg each, determined by the bicinchoninic acid protein assay; Pierce) were boiled in 5× sample buffer, run on 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore, Billerica, MA). Blots were blocked with 5% dry milk in PBS before probing with a phospho-Akt(Thr308)-specific rabbit antiserum (Cell Signaling, Beverly,MA), an affinity-Purified phospho-ERK1/2 (Thr183/Tyr185)-specific rabbit antibody (Promega), or an affininty-purified PSR-specific rabbit antibody (specific for amino acids 363-381; Abcam, Cambridge, MA). Following incubation with an anti-rabbit secondary antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase, immunoreactive bands were visualized by the luminol reaction (ECLplus; Amersham Biosciences). Equivalent loading of protein samples was monitored by Ponceau S staining (0.25% (w/v; Sigma) in 0.1% acetic acid; 5 min) of blotted proteins.Rac1 Pull-down Assay—The level of GTP-bound Rac1 was determined by the GST-PAK CRIB “pull-down” assay as described previously (21Akakura S. Singh S. Spataro M. Akakura R. Kim J.I. Albert M.L. Birge R.B. Exp. Cell Res. 2004; 292: 403-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). In brief, 5 × 105 3T3 fibroblasts were plated for 2 h on 60-mm diameter dishes that had been coated previously with MFG-E8 or bovine serum albumin (10 μg/ml). The cells then were lysed for 10 min in lysis buffer 2 (50 mm Tris (pH 7.2), 1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 0.5% (w/v) sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% (w/v) SDS, 500 mm NaCl, and 10 mm MgCl2, plus protease inhibitors). 500 μg of each cell lysate was incubated for 1 h with glutathione-agarose beads coated with a bacterially expressed fusion protein of glutathione S-transferase (GST) with the GTPase binding domain (CRIB domain; amino acid residue 56-272) of the human PAK kinase, a downstream effector molecule for Rac1, which specifically binds the activated, GTP-loaded form of Rac1. The beads then were washed four times in wash buffer (50 mm Tris (pH 7.2), 1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 150 mm NaCl, and 10 mm MgCl2, plus protease inhibitors). Active Rac1, precipitating with beads, and total Rac1, in the starting lysates, were quantified by densitometry following immunoblotting with a Rac1 antibody (Upstate Biotechnology, Waltham, MA).RESULTSImmortalized 3T3 Cell Lines from PSR+/+, PSR+/-, and PSR-/- Mouse Embryo Fibroblasts—The role of PSR in the non-inflammatory clearance of apoptotic cells remains unresolved. Taking advantage of the ability of non-professional phagocytes to recognize, engulf, and respond to apoptotic cells specifically, 5M. Cvetanovic, J. E. Mitchell, V. Patel, B. S. Avner, Y. Su, P. T. van der Saag, P. L. Witte, S. Fiore, J. S. Levine, and D. S. Ucker, submitted for publication. we established immortalized 3T3 fibroblast cells lines from PSR+/+, PSR+/-, and PSR-/- mouse embryo fibroblasts to test the role of PSR in these processes. The immortalized cell lines were derived from (129 × C57BL/6) embryo fibroblasts taken at day E14.5, prior to manifestations of lethality associated with PSR deficiency (13Li M.O. Sarkisian M.R. Mehal W.Z. Rakic P. Flavell R.A. Science. 2003; 302: 1560-1563Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar), following the 3T3 protocol of Todaro and Green (17Todaro G.J. Green H. J. Cell Biol. 1963; 17: 299-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (1993) Google Scholar). We chose to examine cells with the targeted PSR locus of Li et al. (Fig. 1A; Ref. 13Li M.O. Sarkisian M.R. Mehal W.Z. Rakic P. Flavell R.A. Science. 2003; 302: 1560-1563Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar), because the best genetic evidence implicating PSR in apoptotic clearance is derived from studies of mice harboring that disruption.PSR expression in these cells was evaluated by RT-PCR analysis of PSR transcripts (Fig. 1B) and by immunoblotting with a PSR-specific antibody (Fig. 1C). These tests confirmed both the presence of PSR expression in wild-type cells and in PSR+/- heterozygotes, at roughly equivalent levels, and its absence in PSR-/- fibroblasts. These results a"
https://openalex.org/W1970257904,"Mammalian profilins are abundantly expressed actin monomer-binding proteins, highly conserved with respect to their affinities for G-actin, poly-l-proline, and phosphoinositides. Profilins associate with a large number of proline-rich proteins; the physiological significance and regulation of which is poorly understood. Here we show that profilin 2 associates with dynamin 1 via the C-terminal proline-rich domain of dynamin and thereby competes with the binding of SH3 ligands such as endophilin, amphiphysin, and Grb2, thus interfering with the assembly of the endocytic machinery. We also present a novel role for the brain-specific mouse profilin 2 as a regulator of membrane trafficking. Overexpression of profilin 2 inhibits endocytosis, whereas lack of profilin 2 in neurons results in an increase in endocytosis and membrane recycling. Phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate releases profilin 2 from the profilin 2-dynamin 1 complex as well as from the profilin 2-actin complex, suggesting that profilin 2 is diverging the phosphoinositide signaling pathway to actin polymerization as well as endocytosis.

Profilin is a 15-kDa protein, abundantly expressed in all eukaryotic cells from yeast to mammals. Most organisms harbor more than one profilin gene, and in mouse and human four genes have been identified up to now (1Kwiatkowski D.J. Aklog L. Ledbetter D.H. Morton C.C. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1990; 46: 559-567PubMed Google Scholar, 2Honore B. Madsen P. Andersen A.H. Leffers H. FEBS Lett. 1993; 330: 151-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 3Hu E. Chen Z. Fredrickson T.

Reprod. 2005; 11: 53-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Profilin was first isolated in a 1:1 complex with monomeric actin, and extensive characterization of its effect on actin polymerization established its role as a key regulator of actin dynamics (for a review see Ref. 5Schluter K. Jockusch B.M. Rothkegel M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1359: 97-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). The interaction of profilin and actin is regulated by phosphoinositides (6Lassing I. Lindberg U. Nature. 1985; 314: 472-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (634) Google Scholar). Phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PtdInsP2) 2The abbreviations used are: PtdInsP2, phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate; VASP, vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein; GST, glutathione S-transferase; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; PRD, proline-rich domain; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; BSA, bovine serum albumin; GTPγS, guanosine 5′-3-O-(thio)triphosphate. 2The abbreviations used are: PtdInsP2, phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate; VASP, vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein; GST, glutathione S-transferase; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; PRD, proline-rich domain; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; BSA, bovine serum albumin; GTPγS, guanosine 5′-3-O-(thio)triphosphate. was shown to disrupt the “profilactin” complex, and it was suggested that this provides a mechanism to release ATP-charged actin monomers, which in turn could promote local actin polymerization (7Pollard T.D. Blanchoin L. Mullins R.D. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 2000; 29: 545-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (1147) Google Scholar). In addition to binding to actin, all profilins identified so far except for the profilin of Vaccinia virus (8Machesky L.M. Cole N.B. Moss B. Pollard T.D. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 10815-10824Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) and the mouse profilin IIB splice form (9Di Nardo A. Gareus R. Kwiatkowski D. Witke W. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 3795-3803Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) have been shown to bind to poly-l-proline, an ability of profilin proven to be essential in yeast (10Lu J. Pollard T.D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 1161-1175Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 11Ostrander D.B. Ernst E.G. Lavoie T.B. Gorman J.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 262: 26-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). However, the functional mechanisms and cellular pathways regulated by profilin-poly-l-proline interaction remain unclear. The first physiological ligand described to bind profilin via its poly-l-proline binding site was the focal-adhesion phosphoprotein VASP, which contains multiple proline-rich stretches (12Reinhard M. Giehl K. Abel K. Haffner C. Jarchau T. Hoppe V. Jockusch B.M. Walter U. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1583-1589Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar). Meanwhile, a continuously growing number of profilin ligands have been identified (13Witke W. Trends Cell Biol. 2004; 14: 461-469Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar). Neurons express profilin 1 as well as profilin 2, and a proteomics-based screen in mouse brain identified a number of novel profilin-ligand interactions (14Witke W. Podtelejnikov A.V. Di Nardo A. Sutherland J.D. Gurniak C.B. Dotti C. Mann M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 967-976Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). Profilin 2, in particular, interacts with ligands involved in signal transduction, membrane trafficking, and vesicle recycling such as ROCK2, synapsins, POP-130/CyFIP1, and dynamin 1. These findings suggest a not yet recognized additional role for profilin 2 in membrane trafficking. Here we address this hypothesis by examining the functional importance of the profilin 2-dynamin 1 interaction. Dynamin 1 is a neuron-specific GTPase, which assembles around the necks of budding vesicles and is thought to help in the membrane fission process. Early studies on various dynamin mutants have established the essential role of dynamin in endocytosis (15Herskovits J.S. Burgess C.C. Obar R.A. Vallee R.B. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 565-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar) and synaptic vesicle recycling. To assemble the endocytic machinery, which initiates changes in membrane curvature, dynamin 1 interacts with a number of effector molecules such as amphiphysin (16Takei K. Slepnev V.I. Haucke V. De Camilli P. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 33-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar) and endophilin (17Schmidt A. Wolde M. Thiele C. Fest W. Kratzin H. Podtelejnikov A.V. Witke W. Huttner W.B. Soling H.D. Nature. 1999; 401: 133-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar). Although the importance of these interactions is well established, the spatial and temporal regulation of this process has just begun to be unraveled (18Merrifield C.J. Feldman M.E. Wan L. Almers W. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 691-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (546) Google Scholar). Endocytosis and actin polymerization are tightly linked (19Engqvist-Goldstein A.E. Zhang C.X. Carreno S. Barroso C.

A number of recent reports support the intimate relation of dynamin and the actin cytoskeleton. So, dynamin has been shown to cause actin rearrangements at the immunological synapse in activated T-cells (21Gomez T.S. Hamann M.J. McCarney S. Savoy D.N. Lubking C.M. Heldebrant M.P. Labno C.M.

A. 2002; 99: 167-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). However, our understanding of the nature and regulation of the link of dynamin to the actin cytoskeleton is still far from complete. Here, we provide evidence that one function of profilin 2 is to control dynamin 1 activity by sequestering the binding site for SH3-containing ligands such as endophilin and amphiphysin. We also show that PtdInsP2 is a common signal to release profilin 2 from dynamin 1 as well as G-actin, providing a mechanism by which activation of the endocytic machinery and actin polymerization can be orchestrated at PtdInsP2-rich membrane domains. Antibodies—Anti-dynamin 1 antiserum KG-43 was generated by immunizing rabbits with full-length GST-dynamin 1 expressed in insect cells. The anti-amphiphysin antibody was provided by P. De Camilli. The anti-endophilin antibody was produced by immunizing rabbits with the full-length GST fusion protein expressed in Escherichia coli (expression vector was a generous gift from H. Söling). Antibodies against Mena and VASP were produced by immunizing rabbits with the respective His-tagged proteins purified from insect cells (baculovirus clones were obtained from F. Gertler). The anti-profilin 2 antibody “P2-T” was generated by immunizing rabbits with fragments produced by partial digest of mouse profilin 2 with V8 protease. Secondary antibodies were purchased from Pierce. Uptake of FM 1-43 into Cells and Quantitation by Fluorescence Scanning—For comparative kinetic studies, mouse cortical neurons of wild-type and profilin 2 knock-out mouse embryos (embryonic day 14) were prepared the same day under the same conditions. Cells were seeded at 5 × 105 per well into 24-well plates and allowed to grow and spread for 5-6 days. Uptake buffer was modified Tyrode's solution (150 mm NaCl, 4 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 2 mm CaCl2, 10 mm glucose, 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4). FM 1-43 was diluted in Tyrode's to a concentration of 10 μm, sonicated, spun for 10 min at 7000 rpm, and prewarmed to 37 °C. Before the experiment, cells were washed twice with Tyrode's solution, and the solution was aspirated. Uptakes were initiated by injecting 400 μlof10 μm FM 1-43 in Tyrode's solution into the wells in a fluorescent plate reader (Fluoroskan Ascent II, Labsystems), exciting FM 1-43 fluorescence at 485 nm and reading emission at 590 nm, measuring FM 1-43 in 3-s intervals. Kinetic data were analyzed with the GraFit program (Erithacus Software Ltd.). Cell numbers were accounted for by incubating the cells with Hoechst 33342 (10 mg/ml, Molecular Probes) 1:30,000 in PBS/0.1% Tween 20 for 20 min at room temperature and reading the fluorescence signal at 460 nm after washing three times with PBS and exciting at 355 nm, and by determining total protein content by Bradford assay. Isolation of Protein Complexes—Protein complex formation on beads was carried out as described previously (14Witke W. Podtelejnikov A.V. Di Nardo A. Sutherland J.D. Gurniak C.B. Dotti C. Mann M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 967-976Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). Characterization of Profilin 2 and Endophilin Binding Sites on Dynamin 1—To map the profilin 2 binding sites on the PRD of dynamin 1, 32 12-mer peptides covering the entire PRD of dynamin 1 were synthesized on a SPOT membrane. As a positive control for profilin binding, two peptides from VASP (see Table 1) known to bind profilin 2 were included (51Karakesisoglou I. Janssen K.P. Eichinger L. Noegel A.A. Schleicher M. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 167-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The membrane was blocked overnight in 5% milk powder, 0.15 m NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 0.5% Tween 20, 0.02% sodium azide, and then incubated for 4 h with 10 μg/ml profilin 2 or endophilin. After 4 washes, the membrane was successively incubated with the respective first polyclonal antibodies against profilin 2 or endophilin and the second horseradish peroxidase-labeled anti-rabbit antibody. The signal was developed using ECL reagent (Amersham Biosciences).TABLE 1PRD peptide array synthesized on the SPOT membrane and binding of profilin 2/endophilin Strong (++) and weak binding (+) was judged from the remaining signals after extensive wash of the blot.

Sedimentation velocity profiles were collected by monitoring the absorbance signal at 285 nm. To determine the sedimentation properties of profilin-dynamin complexes, profilin 2 and dynamin 1 were mixed at 25 times molar excess of profilin 2 in 20 mm phosphate, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, and 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol. Sedimentation coefficient and molecular weight distributions were analyzed by the C(s) method implemented in the Sedfit software package (27Schuck P. Biophys. J. 2000; 78: 1606-1619Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2978) Google Scholar). Uptake of FITC-transferrin into Cells—For microscopic analyses, HeLa cells expressing wild-type DsRed-profilin 2, or the DsRed-profilin 2 mutants S134Y and S138D, deficient for poly-l-proline binding, were seeded on coverslips in antibiotic and serum-free medium and starved for 16 h. Uptake was started by replacing the starving medium by serum-containing medium with 20 μg/ml FITC-transferrin (Molecular Probes). The uptake was stopped by dipping the coverslips into ice-cold PBS and transferring them to ice-cold 4% paraformaldehyde/PBS. Actin Polymerization Assays—Actin was purified from rabbit muscle as described (28Spudich J.A. Watt S. J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 4866-4871Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Actin polymerization was assayed in 100-μl reactions containing 5 μm actin (containing 5% pyrene-actin) plus the proteins of interest (profilin 2 at 5 μm and dynamin at 2 μm) in G buffer (2 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 0.2 mm CaCl2, 0.2 mm ATP). Reactions were started by adding 90 μl of premixed components into a well of a black 96-well plate (Greiner) containing 10 μl of 10× polymerization buffer (0.1 m imidazole, pH 7.2, 20 mm MgCl2, 10 mm EGTA). After brief mixing, the polymerization reaction was monitored at 25 °C with a fluorescent plate reader (Fluoroskan Ascent II, Labsystems) in 10-s intervals by exciting pyrene fluorescence at 342 nm and measuring fluorescence emission at 388 nm. The results were plotted as relative fluorescence versus time using the program GraFit (Erithacus Software Ltd.). Immunoprecipitation—For immunoprecipitations with rabbit polyclonal antisera, 30 μl of protein A-Sepharose-slurry (Amersham Biosciences) was washed with PBS and incubated with 25 μl of serum in 1 ml of PBS for 1-2 h at 4 °C on a rotating wheel. After three washes with lysis buffer, the beads were incubated with brain lysate for 2 h then washed 5 times with ice-cold lysis buffer, and the proteins were eluted by boiling in 1× SDS-sample buffer. Protein Purification—All recombinant profilin 2 used in the experiments was the mouse profilin 2a spliceform, the recombinant dynamin 1 the spliceform dynamin 1aa. Recombinant mouse profilin 2a was purified as described before (29Gieselmann R. Kwiatkowski D.J. Janmey P.A. Witke W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 229: 621-628Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recombinant dynamin 1aa was expressed as a GST fusion protein in Hi5 insect cells after infection with baculovirus and purified using glutathione beads. All assays were performed after cleavage and removal of the GST moiety. Grb2, Src-SH3, amphiphysin, and endophilin were expressed as GST fusion proteins in E. coli. Competition Binding Assays—Nunc Maxisorp ELISA plates were coated with 0.5 μg/ml GST-Grb2, GST-amphiphysin, GST-endophilin, and GST-Src-SH3-domain in 50 mm NaHCO3, pH 8.5/0.01% NaN3 overnight at 4 °C. The wells were washed 3 times with 100 μl of PBS/0.05% Tween 20 at room temperature. Unspecific binding sites were blocked with 1% BSA in PBS/0.05% Tween 20 for 2 h at room temperature. The wells were then incubated with an equal amount of recombinant dynamin 1 and increasing amounts of recombinant profilin 2a (or BSA as a control) in 1× profilin dialysis buffer (29Gieselmann R. Kwiatkowski D.J. Janmey P.A. Witke W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 229: 621-628Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) for 2 h at 4°C. Afterward, the wells were washed and incubated with anti-dynamin 1 antibody Hudy-1 1:500 in 1% BSA/PBS/0.05% Tween 20 for 1 h at room temperature. After washing, 100 μl of alkaline phosphatase coupled goat-anti-mouse antibody 1:1000 in 1% BSA/PBS/0.05% Tween was incubated for 1 h at room temperature. After five washes, the wells were incubated with 100 μl of a 1 mg/ml p-nitrophenyl phosphate (Pierce) solution in 5 mm MgCl2/1 m Na2CO3/NaHCO3, pH 9.5, until a discernable yellow signal appeared. The signal was quantitated in an ELISA plate reader at 405 nm. Preparation of PtdInsP2 Micelles—Phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (Sigma) was reconstituted in methanol/chloroform 1:1 to a final concentration of 3 mg/ml. For making micelles, an appropriate amount of stock solution was dried under nitrogen. The lipid film was rehydrated in 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.2/0.1 mm EDTA for at least 30 min at room temperature with occasional mixing to give a concentration of 3 mg/ml. Finally, the mixture was sonicated in a sonicating water bath for 15 min. Profilin 2 Is a Ligand of Dynamin 1—Dynamin 1 had been shown previously to be part of the profilin 2 complex isolated from mouse brain (14Witke W. Podtelejnikov A.V. Di Nardo A. Sutherland J.D. Gurniak C.B. Dotti C. Mann M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 967-976Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). This finding suggests that the actin-binding protein profilin 2 might play a role in regulating endocytosis. To address this hypothesis in more detail, we focused on the biochemical aspects of the profilin 2-dynamin 1 interaction. First, we showed that the association of dynamin 1 and profilin 2 occurs under physiological conditions. As shown in Fig. 1A, dynamin 1 can be co-immunoprecipitated with profilin 2 from brain lysates using a profilin 2-specific antibody. Association by co-immunoprecipitation could be due to direct binding, or be mediated by a third protein. To test for direct binding, we expressed and purified recombinant dynamin 1 and performed binding studies using beads loaded with profilin 1 and profilin 2 (Fig. 1B). In this two-component binding assay dynamin 1 binds efficiently to profilin 2, whereas binding to profilin 1 is an order of magnitude weaker. The binding of profilin 2 to dynamin 1 was independent of the salt concentration within the physiological range (50-250 mm) and largely independent of divalent ions such as Ca2+ and Mg2+. In addition, binding was not affected by ATP, GMP, or GTP and only slightly reduced in the presence of GTPγS (data not shown). From these results we concluded that dynamin 1 binds directly and specifically to profilin 2. We next asked which of the three functional domains of profilin 2, the actin binding site, the PtdInsP2 binding site, or the poly-l-proline binding domain, are employed for dynamin 1 binding. Our results show that the poly-l-proline binding site of profilin is required for dynamin 1 binding, because occupation of this site by a synthetic proline homopolymer abolishes dynamin 1 binding completely (Fig. 1C). Furthermore we generated two mutant forms of profilin 2, which bind actin, but lack poly-l-proline binding. The Ser-138 → Asp mutant mimics phosphorylation of Ser-138, which abolishes poly-l-proline binding. The second profilin 2 point mutation Ser-134 → Tyr replicates a mutation that has previously been shown to affect poly-l-proline binding in profilin 1 (30Bjorkegren C. Rozycki M. Schutt C.E. Lindberg U. Karlsson R. FEBS Lett. 1993; 333: 123-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1D both profilin 2 mutants bind actin comparably to wild-type profilin 2, whereas dynamin 1 binding is completely abrogated. These findings suggested that dynamin 1 most likely uses a proline-rich stretch of amino acids to bind to profilin 2. Dynamin 1 consists of an N-terminal domain harboring the GTPase activity, a central PH domain, and a coiled-coil stretch followed by a conspicuous proline-rich C-terminal domain (see Fig. 1F). To test if the PRD provides the profilin 2 binding site on dynamin 1, we chose to cleave the dynamin 1 molecule into different domains by partial proteolysis and then test the dynamin 1 fragments for profilin 2 binding. The protease subtilisin has been shown to produce a specific pattern of dynamin 1 fragments, in the process of which a 15-kDa C-terminal peptide containing the proline-arginine-rich domain is generated (31Sweitzer S.M. Hinshaw J.E. Cell. 1998; 93: 1021-1029Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (542) Google Scholar). We therefore cleaved recombinant dynamin 1 with limiting amounts of subtilisin and performed binding assays with the generated fragments using profilin 2 beads. The bound dynamin 1 fragments were then identified using the monoclonal antibody Hudy-1, which recognizes an epitope (amino acids 822-838) in the 15-kDa PRD (32Warnock D.E. Terlecky L.J. Schmid S.L. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1322-1328Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Fig. 1E shows that, with increasing amounts of protease, a stable C-terminal 15-kDa fragment is generated, which binds to profilin 2. Based on this we concluded that the PRD of dynamin mediates binding to profilin 2. The PRD of dynamin 1 comprises a number of putative profilin binding sites (Fig. 1F) (14Witke W. Podtelejnikov A.V. Di Nardo A. Sutherland J.D. Gurniak C.B. Dotti C. Mann M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 967-976Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). To identify the exact binding sites of profilin 2 within the PRD and to compare these with the docking sites of other known dynamin 1 ligands we made use of a SPOT peptide array covering the entire PRD. A total of 32 overlapping 12-mers staggered by 3 amino acids were synthesized on a membrane support and tested for binding of profilin 2 (see “Material and Methods”). As shown in Fig. 1F, five profilin 2 binding sites were identified within the PRD, and based on the recovery of signal after extensive washing we could distinguish three weaker and two stronger binding sites (see Table 1). Interestingly, the strong profilin 2 binding sites overlap with the docking sites for Grb2 and amphiphysin (33Okamoto P.M. Herskovits J.S. Vallee R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11629-11635Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 34Grabs D. Slepnev V.I. Songyang Z. David C. Lynch M. Cantley L.C. De Camilli P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13419-13425Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Endophilin, a recently described SH3 ligand of dynamin 1 is also thought to bind along the PRD (35Slepnev V.I. Ochoa G.C. Butler M.H. Grabs D. De Camilli P. Science. 1998; 281: 821-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). Using the same SPOT peptide array and recombinant endophilin we could identify one weak and two strong endophilin binding sites on the PRD. The strong endophilin binding sites stretch over a region of several peptides and overlap with the profilin 2 binding site as well as the Grb2 and amphiphysin docking site. Although we have identified several potential profilin 2 binding sites along the PRD, the question remains whether all these sites are occupied in the profilin 2-dynamin 1 complex. To determine the stoichiometry of the complex in vitro we performed velocity sedimentation using an analytical ultracentrifuge. As shown in Fig. 1G, a major component with molecular mass 15 kDa was identified, which corresponds to the excess monomeric profilin that was used to shift the equilibrium toward complex formation. Apart from monomeric profilin 2, complexes of 155-160 and 250 kDa and some higher molecular mass complexes were identified. The 250-kDa complex represents the GST-dynamin 1 dimer, and the higher molecular mass complexes correspond to oligomers of GST-dynamin 1, whereas the 155- to 160-kDa complex is in good agreement with a 2:1 complex of profilin 2 (15 kDa) and GST-dynamin 1 (126 kDa). These results show that, under the conditions used in the sedimentation experiment, the profilin 2-dynamin 1 complex exists at a 2:1 stoichiometry. Binding of Actin and Dynamin 1 to Profilin 2 Is Mutually Exclusive—How could the profilin 2-dynamin 1 complex link the actin cytoskeleton to the endocytic machinery? One possibility is a ternary complex of profilin 2, dynamin 1, and actin, which targets actin monomers to the site of endocytosis. We tested this hypothesis of a ternary complex using G-actin immobilized on DNase 1 beads. Profilin 2 alone binds to the G-actin-loaded beads and forms a profilin-actin complex as expected from previous results (e.g. Ref. 36Nyman T. Page R. Schutt C.E. Karlsson R. Lindberg U. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 15828-15833Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). However, no binding of the profilin 2-dynamin 1 complexes to G-actin-loaded beads was observed (Fig. 2A), suggesting that profilin 2 can either bind to actin or to dynamin 1 but not both concomitantly. In cells, ∼50% of profilin is normally found free of actin, and the other half is tightly bound in a stable G-actin-profilin complex. To exclude the possibility that lack of trimeric complex formation was due to the different history of complexes formed by dynamin 1, recombinant mouse profilin 2 and purified rabbit actin, versus dynamin 1 and the authentic “profilactin” found in cells (37Malm B. Larsson H. Lindberg U. J. Muscle Res. Cell Motil. 1983; 4: 569-588Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), we isolated native profilactin from mouse brain and repeated the binding assay with dynamin 1 and DNase 1 beads. This experiment confirmed again that dynamin 1 does not associate with actin-bound profilin 2 (Fig. 2A, last two lanes). On the contrary, G-actin tends to destabilize a preformed dynamin 1-profilin 2 complex as shown in Fig. 2B. When profilin 2 beads loaded with dynamin 1 were incubated in the presence of 50 μm G-actin, the dynamin 1-profilin 2 complex became instable and dynamin 1 was partially released (Fig. 2B). These binding assays do not exclude the possibility that the association of profilin 2 and dynamin 1 could still influence actin polymerization by an as yet unrecognized mechanism. We therefore performed actin polymerization studies using fluorescently labeled pyrene-actin in the presence of profilin 2 and dynamin 1. As shown in Fig. 2C, dynamin 1 alone did not have any significant effect on actin nucleation or filament elongation. Even at the highest dynamin 1 concentration used in the assay (2 μm dynamin, dynamin-actin ratio 1:2) polymerization kinetics were not affected, and steady-state levels of actin polymerization were comparable to control experiments. Profilin 2 on the other hand slowed down the nucleation and elongation step of actin polymerization, as shown before by others (38Jonc"
https://openalex.org/W2146528974,"Calponin 2 (h2 calponin, CNN2) is an actin-binding protein implicated in cytoskeletal organization. We have found that the expression of calponin 2 is relatively restricted to vasculature from 16 to 30 h post-fertilization during zebrafish (Danio rerio) development. Forty-eight hours after injecting antisense morpholino oligos against calponin 2 into embryos at the 1-4-cell stage, zebrafish demonstrated various cardiovascular defects, including sluggish axial and head circulation, absence of circulation in intersegmental vessels and in the dorsal longitudinal anastomotic vessel, enlarged cerebral ventricles, and pericardial edema, in addition to an excess bending, spiraling tail and twisting of the caudal fin. Knockdown of calponin 2 in the Tg(fli1:EGFP)y1 zebrafish line (in which a fli1 promoter drives vascular-specific enhanced green fluorescent protein expression) indicated that diminished calponin 2 expression blocked the proper migration of endothelial cells during formation of intersegmental vessels. In vitro studies showed that basic fibroblast growth factor-induced human umbilical vein endothelial cell migration was down-regulated by knockdown of calponin 2 expression using an antisense adenovirus, and overexpression of calponin 2 enhanced migration and hastened wound healing. These events were correlated with activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase; moreover, inhibition of this pathway blocked the promigratory effect of calponin 2. Collectively, these data suggest that calponin 2 plays an important role in the migration of endothelial cells both in vivo and in vitro and that its expression is critical for proper vascular development.

It binds to extracellular regulated Ser/Thr kinases (ERK1 and ERK2) (13Leinweber B.D. Leavis P.C. Grabarek Z. Wang C.L. Morgan K.G. Biochem.

Less is known about the function of calponin 2. Although the sequence conservation between calponin 2 and calponin 1 points to a similar function, they have diverged during vertebrate evolution, and the sequence diversity, especially in the carboxyl-terminal tail, suggests that they may have different functions. Calponin 2 has been shown to play a role in cytoskeletal organization (16Fukui Y. Masuda H. Takagi M. Takahashi K. Kiyokane K. J. Dermatol. Sci. 1997; 14: 29-36Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Overexpression of calponin 2 in a cell line of smooth muscle origin (SM3) lacking calponin 2 inhibits cell proliferation (17Hossain M.M. Hwang D.Y. Huang Q.Q. Sasaki Y. Jin J.P. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 284: C156-C167Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), likely mediated via the actin cytoskeleton. In a subcellular localization study, a green fluorescent calponin 2 fusion protein is shown to localize to the ends of stress fibers and in the protrusions of spreading cells (18Danninger C. Gimona M. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 3725-3736Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The zebrafish is a valuable model system for studying vascular development, a complex and tightly regulated process. Blood vessel formation and expression patterns of several genes of importance in zebrafish embryonic vessel formation are similar to those in other vertebrates (19Liang D. Xu X. Chin A.J.

This conservation points toward similar vasculogenic and angiogenic signaling pathways (22Roman B.L. Weinstein B.M. Bioessays. 2000; 22: 882-893Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Importantly, zebrafish embryos can survive without a functioning circulatory system during the first three days of development (23Ransom D.G. Haffter P. Odenthal J. Brownlie A. Vogelsang E. Kelsh R.N. Brand M. van Eeden F.J. Furutani-Seiki M. Granato M. Hammerschmidt M. Heisenberg C.P. Jiang Y.J. Kane D.A. Mullins M.C. Nusslein-Volhard C. Development (Camb.). 1996; 123: 311-319PubMed Google Scholar), during which organogenesis is occurring. Thus vascular effects can be studied in a relatively pristine fashion. Moreover, fluorescent imaging methods, such as confocal microangiography, have been used to image vascular patterning in the fish. Transgenic zebrafish with vessel-specific expression of enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) under the control of the fli1 promoter makes it possible to further visualize fine cellular features of vascular endothelial cells (ECs) (24Lawson N.D. Weinstein B.M. Dev. Biol. 2002; 248: 307-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (1603) Google Scholar). Finally, gene-specific “knockdown” through the use of antisense morpholino oligonucleotides (25Nasevicius A. Ekker S.C. Nat. Genet. 2000; 26: 216-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (2137) Google Scholar) provides a rapid way to ascertain in vivo function of a gene. Our strategy to identify novel genes relevant to vascular development was as follows. A whole mount in situ hybridization screen was performed using an adult zebrafish kidney cDNA library, and it identified 44 transcripts from 4000 with vessel-enriched expression during early zebrafish development. One of these transcripts (GA3396) encoded a possible calponin 2 orthologue and was found to be primarily expressed in vessels at 24 h post-fertilization (hpf). Morpholino oligonucleotides (MOs) specifically targeting zebrafish calponin 2 were then used to knock down calponin 2 expression. The observed vasculature defects were studied in detail using a combination of several techniques. Signaling pathways were further defined using human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) as a mammalian model in vitro. Isolation of Zebrafish cDNA—GA3396 (calponin 2) was identified by an in situ hybridization screen (26Galloway J.L. Wingert R.A. Thisse C. Thisse B. Zon L.I. Dev. Cell. 2005; 8: 109-116Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar) and was isolated from an adult zebrafish kidney cDNA library (Dr. J. Rast, Children's Hospital, St. Petersburg, FL). Animals—Zebrafish were maintained at 28.5 °C as described previously (27Westerfield M. The Zebrafish Book. A Guide for the Laboratory Use of Zebrafish (Danio rerio). 4th. University of Oregon Press, Eugene, OR2000Google Scholar). Developmental stages were determined by embryo morphology and hpf (28Kimmel C.B. Ballard W.W. Kimmel S.R. Ullmann B. Schilling T.F. Dev. Dyn. 1995; 203: 253-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (8862) Google Scholar). For in situ hybridization, embryos were incubated in 0.003% 1-phenyl-2-thiourea after 24 hpf to prevent pigment formation. Whole Mount RNA in Situ Hybridization—Whole mount RNA in situ hybridization was carried out as described previously (29Jowett T. Lettice L. Trends Genet. 1994; 10: 73-74Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar, 30Thisse B. Heyer V. Lux A. Alunni V. Degrave A. Seiliez I. Kirchner J. Parkhill J.P. Thisse C. Methods Cell Biol. 2004; 77: 505-519Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Full-length antisense and sense probes for zebrafish calponin 2 were synthesized. For histological analysis, specimens were fixed in 4% paraformal-dehyde overnight at 4 °C, dehydrated with ethanol, and embedded in JB-4 resin (Polysciences, Inc., Warrington, PA). Serial sections were examined with a Nikon Optiphot 2 Microscope. Antisense Morpholino Oligonucleotides: Sequence and Injection—MOs were designed and synthesized by GeneTools, LLC (Philomath, OR), to target the ATG site (MOATG) and the third exon-intron junction (MOs13589). MO sequences were: MOATG, 5′-GCCTCTGTTAAACTGCGAAGACATT-3′ (reverse complementary sequence of start codon is indicated as italic letters); MOs13589, 5′-AAGTTGCGCTCACCTGATGCCAGTT-3′; and 5-mispair control for MOs13589 (Mis13589), 5′-AAcTTGCcCTCAgCTGATcCCAcTT-3′ (mispairing bases are shown in lower case letters). MOs were initially dissolved in sterile water to a concentration of 4 mm. After dilution with injection buffer (100 mm NaCl, 50 mm KCl, 0.5 mm Hepes, pH 7.6) to the desired concentration, 1 nl of diluted MO solution was injected into the 1-4-cell embryos mounted in agarose slots. Digital Image Analysis—Similar digital image analysis was done as described by Lee et al. (31Lee P. Goishi K. Davidson A.J. Mannix R. Zon L. Klagsbrun M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 10470-10475Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Briefly, ∼100 sequential phase contrast images of the embryos were taken using 100× magnification on the microscope at ∼1 frame/s. Thereafter, a z projection of the standard deviation of the whole image sequence was constructed using ImageJ (47Abramoff M.D. Magelhaes P.J. Ram S.J. Biophotonics Int. 2004; 11: 36-42Google Scholar). The standard deviation measured the variance of the gray value from the mean at a given position caused by moving objects, in effect depicting the flow of erythrocytes in the embryos. Microangiography—Microangiography was performed as described previously (32Weinstein B.M. Stemple D.L. Driever W. Fishman M.C. Nat. Med. 1995; 1: 1143-1147Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar), except that 0.02-μm Fluorospheres® with red fluorescence (Molecular Probes) in 1% bovine serum albumin were used during the injection. RT-PCR and Sequencing—After injection of the MOs, embryos were collected at 48 hpf and stored in RNAlater® (Ambion) at -80 °C before extracting the total RNA with RNAqueous-4PCR kit (Ambion). Two μg of total RNAs were reverse-transcribed into cDNA using SUPER-SCRIPT II (Invitrogen) and amplified with the Advantage-GC 2 PCR Kit (BD Biosciences). The PCR products were then cloned into pCRII-TOPO® vector using the TOPO® cloning kit (Invitrogen). Eight clones were randomly picked and sequenced. Plasmid Construction—Full-length calponin 2 cDNA was PCR (Advantage-GC cDNA PCR kit from Clontech)-amplified from HUVEC RT product using forward primer 5′-ACCATGGGTAAGCCTATCCCTAACCCTCTCCTCGGTCTCGATTCTACGAGCTCCACGCAGTTCAACAAGG-3′ (containing the V5 tag) and reverse primer 5′-CAGATGGGAAGACGATGTGGGGAGAG-3′ and TA-cloned into the pCRII vector (Invitrogen). The insert was excised with EcoRI and ligated into the pCS2+ expression vector and confirmed by full-length sequencing. pShuttle-CMV Calponin 2 Plasmid Construction, Adenovirus Amplification, and HUVEC Infection—Full-length human calponin 2 cDNA with a V5 tag was PCR-amplified from the construct pCS2+ calponin 2 with forward primer 5′-TTTAGATCTACCATGGGTAAGCCTATCCCTAACCCTCTCCTCGGTCTCGATTCTACGAGCTCCACGCAGTTCAACAAGG-3′ and reverse primer 5′-TTTAAGCTTCAGATGGGAAGACGATGTGGGGAGAG-3′, digested with BglII and HindIII, and cloned into pShuttle-CMV vector. Antisense calponin 2 was PCR-amplified from the same construct with forward primer 5′-TTTAAGCTTACCATGAGCTCCACGCAGTTCAACA-3′ and reverse primer 5′-TTTAGATCTCAGATGGGAAGACGATGTGGGGAGAG-3′, digested with BglII and HindIII, and ligated into pShuttle-CMV. Recombinants were obtained using BJ 5183 AD-1 electrocompetent cells (Stratagene). Adenoviruses were amplified using QBI-HEK293 cells (Q Biogene, Inc., Irvine, CA). Amplification, CsCl purification and virus storage were done according to the protocol (48He T.C. Zhou S. da Costa L.T. Yu J. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2509-2514Crossref PubMed Scopus (3256) Google Scholar), and viral titers were determined using Adeno-X™ rapid titer kit (BD Biosciences). HUVECs (Cascade Biologics, Inc., Portland OR, passage number <5) cultured in 6-well tissue culture plates to 60% confluency were infected with different concentrations of adenoviruses for 6 h, at which point fresh EGM™-2 MV medium (Cambrex) was added and cells incubated for 24-48 h before further experiments. For the MEK-DD (constitutively active MEK construct, a gift from Dr. Eileen O'Leary, Harvard Institute of Medicine) rescue experiment, HUVECs were infected with empty or calponin 2 antisense adenoviruses for 6 h, changed to EGM™-2 MV medium for 20 h, and then infected with MEK-DD adenovirus at a multiplicity of infection of 350 in EBM™-2 (Cambrex) with 0.5% serum for 2 days. Western Blot Analysis—Protein concentration was measured using BCA protein assay reagents from Pierce. Proteins were loaded onto NuPAGE Novex 4-12% bis-Tris gel (Invitrogen) and transferred onto Polyscreen polyvinylidene difluoride transfer membrane (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The primary monoclonal antibody sources were as follows: calponin 1 (CP3), calponin 2 (CP21) (33Jin J.P. Wu D. Gao J. Nigam R. Kwong S. Protein Expression Purif. 2003; 31: 231-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (Chemicon International), phospho-ERK1/2, and total ERK1/2 polyclonal antibody (Cell Signaling Technology). The horseradish peroxidase-coupled secondary antibodies were from Amersham Biosciences, and SuperSignal chemiluminescent substrates (Pierce) were used for visualization. Migration Assay—Migration assay was done as previously described (34Seth P. Lin Y. Hanai J. Shivalingappa V. Duyao M.P. Sukhatme V.P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2005; 332: 533-541Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Wound-healing Assay—HUVECs infected with adenoviruses were grown on 6-well tissue culture plates, and wounds of defined size were made into the confluent cell layer. Phase contrast micrographs were used to assess wound closure. Quantification was done by dividing the cell number within the wounds by the area of the wounds and then normalizing to the control for each experiment. Luciferase Assay—Plasmids were transiently transfected into HUVECs using SuperFect transfection reagent (Qiagen). The cells were incubated for 20 h after transfection in EGM-2 MV medium, and cell lysates were collected with passive lysis buffer. The Dual Luciferase Reporter Assay System (Promega) was used to measure luciferase activities, determined using a luminometer normalized with sea pansy luciferase activity under the control of the thymidine kinase promoter. Cloning of Calponin 2 from Zebrafish—The zebrafish GA3396 cDNA consisted of 2213 nucleotides after it was fully sequenced (GenBank™ accession number DQ104245). The predicted protein contained 307 amino acids with ∼78% overall amino acid identities to pig, mouse, Xenopus, and human calponin 2 (Fig. 1, A and B). A phylogenetic tree indicates that zebrafish GA3396 evolved from the same ancestor as other calponin 2 genes (Fig. 1C). After the conserved Cys-273, the carboxyl-terminal tail of this zebrafish protein was composed of 35 amino acids and had a pI of 2.97, closer to human calponin 2 (35 amino acids and pI of 2.56) than to human calponin 1 (24 amino acids and pI of 5.60). Lys-151 is conserved in mammalian calponin 1 but is not present in human calponin 2 nor is it present in our zebrafish sequence (Fig. 1A). Ser-175 and Thr-184, the PKC and Ca2+/CaM kinase II phosphorylation sites in human calponin 1, which are conserved among all calponins, are also present in our zebrafish protein at residues 176 and 185. Together, these data suggest that the GA3396 clone is zebrafish calponin 2. After blast searching in the latest zebrafish whole genome shotgun assembly Zv5 (Sanger Institute), the zebrafish calponin 2 cDNA was found to correspond to a gene region on chromosome 2. This gene has 7 exons spanning over 6.1 kb of genomic DNA, whereas the 7 exons of the human calponin 2 distribute over 12.2 kb of genomic DNA. Expression Pattern of Calponin 2 in Early Zebrafish Development—Because clone GA3396 had been selected on the basis of its vascular expression in a whole mount in situ screen conducted at 9 hpf to 5 days post-fertilization. We proceeded to first analyze its expression in detail during early zebrafish development. No specific expression of calponin 2 could be detected until 16 hpf (data not shown). At 16 hpf, expression of calponin 2 was more restricted to the posterior midline in presumed angioblast cells known to form axial vessels (Fig. 2, A and B). From 24 to 30 hpf, expression was observed throughout the vasculature, including the aorta, the caudal and posterior cardinal vein, blood vessels in the head (middle cerebral blood vessel, eye blood vessel) (Fig. 2; C, D, G, and H), the duct of Cuvier (Fig. 2I, arrowhead), and intersegmental vessels (ISVs) (Fig. 2L). Staining was strong in the aortic wall, but the hypochord was not labeled (Fig. 2K). Labeling was also observed in the epidermis (mainly in the median fin fold), gut, dorsal spinal cord (Fig. 2, C and G), forebrain ventricular zone (Fig. 2I), and at rhombomere boundaries (Fig. 2J). Knockdown of Calponin 2 Expression by MOs Leads to Vascular Defects—MOs were designed to knock down calponin 2 expression. The translation blocker (MOATG) was found to be efficacious in an in vitro transcription and translation assay (data not shown). The second MO (MOs13589) targeted the third exon-intron junction. The advantage of using MOs13589 for the knockdown of calponin 2 expression was that we could confirm its effectiveness by RT-PCR. Subsequent sequencing of the PCR product derived from RNA collected from the injected fish showed that exon 2 was directly linked to exon 4 after blockage of the third donor splice site by MOs13589, resulting in a smaller mRNA, which had two stop codons at 184 and 193 nucleotides downstream of the ATG (Fig. 3, A-C). The predicted protein would comprise the first 60 of its 307 amino acids and lack most of its known functional domains. The phenotypes caused by different doses of MOATG, MOs13589, and Mis13589 were carefully evaluated and compared at 48 hpf (Table 1). Although 0.2 mm Mis13589 had no effect on the development of embryos, both MOATG- and MOs13589-injected embryos showed dramatic and identical changes in vascular development at 48 hpf. MOs13589 was approximately twice as potent as MOATG. MOs13589 at 0.2 mm gave very similar phenotypes to those obtained by 0.4 mm MOATG. Because 0.2 mm MOs13589 resulted in the absence of intersegmental circulation in almost every embryo without causing dramatic changes in overall morphology and massive death of embryos, this concentration was used in all of the subsequent experiments.TABLE IFrequencies (%) of calponin 2 morphant circulation defects at 48 hpf after injection of different doses of MOsCirculation phenotypeMis13589 (mM)MOATG (mM)MOs13589 (mM)0.20.050.10.20.40.050.10.20.4HeartbeatSlowaFrom 60 to 160 beats/min.02031711837469Barelyb<60 beats/min.001926195265189ErythrocytesReducedc20-80% of control embryos.02023451335433Occasionallyd<20% of control embryos.0019364510285789Axial CirculationSluggish02033501835513Absent001926405284989Intersegmental circulationSlow001030131300Absent05437798267810097Dead embryosePercentage of total dead embryos in total embryos.

Open table in a new tab After injecting 0.2 mm MOs13589, no obvious morphological alterations in MO-injected fish in comparison with wild type embryos could be observed prior to 18 hpf. At ∼27 hpf, circulating erythrocytes were present in control embryos but not in most of the morphants. In some of the morphants, pools of red blood cells could be found in the caudal vein. At 48 hpf, most of the morphants developed hindbrain ventricular edema and pericardial edema in addition to bending and spiraling of the tail and twisting of the caudal fin (Fig. 3, D and E). A digital motion analysis in control embryos showed vigorously circulating erythrocytes throughout the embryos, including axial vessels, ISVs, and head vessels. While in the morphants, we found a significantly reduced number of erythrocytes circulating sluggishly in the trunk vessels, no intersegmental circulation of blood cells, and weak and slowly pumping hearts (Fig. 3, F and G; Table 1). Knockdown of Calponin 2 Prevents the Proper Migration of ECs to Form the Dorsal Portion of ISVs—These results suggested that knockdown of calponin 2 could lead to multiple vascular defects in the zebrafish. We therefore carried out the knockdown experiments in the Tg(fli1:EGFP)y1 line, in which robust expression of EGFP in virtually all ECs and their angioblast precursors (24Lawson N.D. Weinstein B.M. Dev. Biol. 2002; 248: 307-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (1603) Google Scholar) would provide us a particularly powerful tool for dissecting the vascular anomalies noted. Vascular development was closely monitored with fluorescent microscopy after injection of MOs13589. Early vasculogenesis, the de novo formation of major trunk vessels by co-migration and coalescence of angioblast progenitor cells originating in the trunk lateral mesoderm (35Risau W. Flamme I. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1995; 11: 73-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (1362) Google Scholar), was largely unaffected in the morphants in comparison with that in wild types. Well formed axial vessels could be found in both controls and morphants at 22 hpf (Fig. 4, A and B), consistent with our fli1 in situ hybridization staining results (data not shown). Starting from 20 hpf, the ECs started to sprout and migrate to form the ISVs in control embryos, a phenomenon not observed in morphants until 22 hpf (Fig. 4, A and B). Strikingly, although all of the ECs in the control embryos migrated dorsally across the midline and further dorsally at ∼23 hpf, most of the ECs in the morphants did not migrate further after they reached the midline at ∼25 hpf. This resulted in a partial primary ISV network in the morphants (Fig. 4D) in contrast to the delicate EC network in control embryos (Fig. 4C) at 30 hpf. Even at 37 hpf, we could see bright green dots, the cell bodies of ECs in ISVs, still lined up at the embryo midline throughout the length of the fish in almost every morphant (Fig. 4, F and G). Thus, this difference between normal and morphant fish was unlikely to merely represent a delay in an otherwise normal developmental program. At 52 hpf, a small percentage of these ECs remained exactly as they were at 36 hpf; some of the ECs branched horizontally at the midline and connected to each other. Most of the ECs did sprout dorsally during this time period but followed crooked paths to form fragmentary dorsal longitudinal anastomotic vessels (Fig. 4, H and I). These ISVs and dorsal longitudinal anastomotic vessels were not functional for blood flow, as shown previously (Fig. 3, F and G), and were further confirmed by microangiography with 0.02-μm Fluorospheres (Fig. 4, J and K). The relatively high expression of calponin 2 in ECs and its important role in the proper formation of ISVs during zebrafish development prompted us to further study the function of calponin 2 in primary ECs in vitro and to probe signaling events. We focused on a study of endothelial cell migration, as this appeared to be the defect noted in vivo. EC Migration Is Augmented by Overexpressing Calponin 2 and Inhibited by Calponin 2 Antisense in Vitro—We generated adenoviral constructs of full-length calponin 2 and its antisense counterpart, and protein levels were checked 30 h after infection in HUVECs (Fig. 5A). The expression level of calponin 2 was ∼25-fold higher compared with that of endogenous calponin 2 in our empty virus control. The calponin 2 antisense virus knocked down endogenous calponin 2 expression in HUVECs to undetectable levels, whereas the expression of calponin 1 was unaffected. To investigate the functional effects of modulating calponin 2 levels, HUVEC migration assay was done, which showed increased cell migration by calponin 2 (≈7-fold) compared with base line in the empty virus control or in the antisense virus-infected cells (Fig. 5B). Because migration in vivo is often stimulated by gradients of a growth factor, we redid our experiments under stimulation of basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), a potent and well studied promigratory agent for ECs. In the migration assay with 20 ng/ml bFGF (Fig. 5C), calponin 2 augmented HUVEC migration by only 50%, suggesting that calponin 2-induced downstream signaling migh"
https://openalex.org/W2073081664,"Stathmin is a ubiquitous microtubule destabilizing protein that is believed to play an important role linking cell signaling to the regulation of microtubule dynamics. Here we show that stathmin strongly destabilizes microtubule minus ends in vitro at steady state, conditions in which the soluble tubulin and microtubule levels remain constant. Stathmin increased the minus end catastrophe frequency ∼13-fold at a stathmin:tubulin molar ratio of 1:5. Stathmin steady-state catastrophe-promoting activity was considerably stronger at the minus ends than at the plus ends. Consistent with its ability to destabilize minus ends, stathmin strongly increased the treadmilling rate of bovine brain microtubules. By immunofluorescence microscopy, we also found that stathmin binds to purified microtubules along their lengths in vitro. Co-sedimentation of purified microtubules polymerized in the presence of a 1:5 initial molar ratio of stathmin to tubulin yielded a binding stoichiometry of 1 mol of stathmin per ∼14.7 mol of tubulin in the microtubules. The results firmly establish that stathmin can increase the steady-state catastrophe frequency by a direct action on microtubules, and furthermore, they indicate that an important regulatory action of stathmin in cells may be to destabilize microtubule minus ends.

Its expression is also elevated in a number of leukemias and solid tumors, which has led to the suggestion that it may be involved in tumorigenesis (5Roos G. Brattsand G. Landberg G. Marklund U.

The extensive phosphorylation of stathmin by various kinases activated during cell proliferation and differentiation (6Schubart U.K. Xu J. Fan W. Cheng G. Goldstein H. Alpini G. Shafritz D.A.

The dynamic behaviors of microtubules play essential roles in their cellular functions (13Mitchison T.J. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1988; 4: 527-549Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14Gelfand V.I. Bershadsky A.D. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1991; 7: 93-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). In one form of dynamics, treadmilling, microtubules grow at their plus ends and shorten at their minus ends without changing lengths (15Margolis R.L. Wilson L. Nature. 1978; 293: 705-711Crossref Scopus (205) Google Scholar, 16Rodionov V.I. Borisy G.G. Science. 1997; 275: 215-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 17Panda D. Miller H.P. Wilson L.

It is hypothesized that the treadmilling rate is controlled by the tubulin dissociation rate constant at the minus ends (17Panda D. Miller H.P. Wilson L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 12459-12464Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). In the second form, dynamic instability, microtubule ends switch stochastically between periods of growth and shortening (19Mitchison T.J. Kirschner M.W. Nature. 1984; 312: 237-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (2339) Google Scholar). With purified microtubules, dynamic instability occurs at both the plus and minus ends, with dynamic instability at plus ends more robust than at the minus ends (20Walker R.A. O'Brien E.T. Pryer N.K.

In cells the minus ends of microtubules do not grow and, thus, do not undergo dynamic instability (22Rodionov V.I. Nadezhdina E.S. Borisy G.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 115-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 23Dammermann A. Desai A. Oegema K. Curr. Biol. 2003; 13: 614-624Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). They are either capped and stable or they shorten persistently (22Rodionov V.I. Nadezhdina E.S. Borisy G.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The mechanisms responsible for controlling microtubule dynamics in cells are not well understood. A number of plus end destabilizing proteins have been identified including XKCM1/MCAK and stathmin (8Belmont L.D. Mitchison T.J.

Cell. 1996; 84: 37-47Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar). Only a few proteins have been identified that destabilize microtubules at their minus ends. Among these are the KinI kinesin KLP10A, which has been shown to depolymerize the minus ends of spindle microtubules in Drosophila (28Rogers G.C. Rogers S.L. Schwimmer T.A. Ems-McClung S.C. walczak C.E. Vale R.D. Scholey J.M. Sharp D.J. Nature. 2004; 427: 364-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar), and XKCM1 and XKIF2, other members of the Kinesin 13 (Kin I) superfamily which have been shown to destabilize artificially stabilized minus ends in vitro (29Popov A.V. Severin F. Karsenti E. Curr. Biol. 2002; 12: 1326-1330Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Minus ends of microtubules tethered at centrosomes are thought to be blocked and not dynamic (22Rodionov V.I. Nadezhdina E.S. Borisy G.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 115-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 23Dammermann A. Desai A. Oegema K. Curr. Biol. 2003; 13: 614-624Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). However, the minus ends of non-attached microtubules can undergo shortening and sometimes can continuously depolymerize as their plus ends grow in a treadmilling fashion (30Keating T.J. Peloquin J.G. Rodionov V.I. Momcilovic D. Borisy G.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 5078-5083Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar, 31Shaw S.L. Kamyar R. Ehrhardt D.W. Science. 2003; 300: 1715-1718Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar). In addition, whereas the minus ends of spindle microtubules are tethered at the spindle poles, they are not blocked and continuously depolymerize. Coupled with growth at the plus ends of such microtubules, there is a pole-ward treadmilling-like flow of tubulin from the plus to minus ends (32Mitchison T.J. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 637-652Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar, 33Sawin K.E. Mitchison T.J. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 112: 941-954Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). The mechanisms responsible for controlling microtubule shortening at their minus ends are under intense study (28Rogers G.C. Rogers S.L. Schwimmer T.A. Ems-McClung S.C. walczak C.E. Vale R.D.

One possible regulator of minus end microtubule dynamics is the microtubule destabilizing protein, stathmin. Stathmin has been shown to increase the catastrophe frequency at the plus ends of purified microtubules (9Howell B. Larsson N. Gullberg M. Cassimeris L. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 105-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar), of microtubules in Xenopus cell extracts (8Belmont L.D. Mitchison T.J. Cell. 1996; 84: 623-631Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (589) Google Scholar), and of microtubules in living cells (34Marklund U. Larsson N. Gradin H.M. Brattsand G. Gullberg M. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5290-5298Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar, 35Howell B. Deacon H. Cassimeris L. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 3713-3722PubMed Google Scholar, 36Holmfeldt P. Larsson N. Segerman B. Howell B. Morabito J. Cassimeris L. Gullberg M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 73-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Evidence suggesting that stathmin might associate with the minus ends of microtubules was obtained in HeLa cells, where stathmin was shown by immunofluorescence microscopy to localize at the mitotic spindle poles (37Kuntziger T. Gavet O. Sobel A. Bornens M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 22979-22984Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The mechanisms by which stathmin destabilizes microtubules and increases the catastrophe frequency have been focus of much study. It is clear that sequestration of soluble tubulin by stathmin and the resulting reduction in the tubulin concentration can increase the catastrophe frequency (a switch from microtubule growth to shortening) and can also decrease the amount of microtubule polymer (9Howell B. Larsson N. Gullberg M. Cassimeris L. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 105-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 11Cassimeris L. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2002; 14: 18-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar, 38Curmi P.A. Andersen S.S. Lachkar S. Gavet O. Karsenti E. Knossow M. Sobel A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25029-25036Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Although direct evidence for the ability of stathmin to bind to microtubules has been lacking, it has been suggested that stathmin may increase the plus end catastrophe frequency by directly interacting with microtubules (9Howell B. Larsson N. Gullberg M. Cassimeris L. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 105-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 11Cassimeris L. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2002; 14: 18-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar). Specifically, Howell et al. (9Howell B. Larsson N. Gullberg M. Cassimeris L. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 105-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar) found that under net microtubule assembly conditions (presteady state), stathmin increased the plus end catastrophe frequency without reducing the microtubule growth rate, indicating that stathmin might act directly on the microtubules themselves. However, analysis of microtubule dynamics under presteadystate conditions, when the free tubulin concentration is higher than what it would be at steady state and the polymer mass is increasing, would not reveal the complete effects of stathmin because changes in the soluble tubulin concentration and polymer level could mask some of its direct actions on the microtubules. In the present work we analyzed the effects of stathmin on microtubule dynamic instability in vitro at both minus and plus ends at physiological pH, pH 7.2, and polymer mass steady state. At these conditions the soluble tubulin was maintained at the true steady-state critical concentration, and the microtubule level remained constant so that the direct actions of stathmin on the microtubules could be determined unambiguously. We found that stathmin strongly increases the steady-state catastrophe frequency at the minus ends and that its catastrophe-promoting activity is considerably stronger at minus ends than at plus ends. Consistent with its ability to destabilize microtubule minus ends, stathmin increased the treadmilling rate of microtubule-associated protein (MAP) 3The abbreviations used are: MAP, microtubule-associated protein; PIPES, piperazine-1,4-bis(2-ethanesulfonic acid); Mes, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid. -rich microtubules in vitro. As predicted from its action on dynamic instability and treadmilling at steady state, we also found that stathmin binds to microtubules in vitro. The results support the idea that stathmin might regulate microtubule dynamics in cells by directly interacting with microtubules and further indicate that an important action of stathmin in cells might be to destabilize microtubule minus ends. Tubulin and Stathmin—MAP-rich bovine brain microtubule protein (∼ 20% MAPs and 80% tubulin) and tubulin derived from the microtubule protein were purified as described previously (21Panda D. Jordan M.A. Chu K.C. Wilson L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29807-29812Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The cloning and expression of human recombinant stathmin has also been previously described (39Curmi P.A. Maucuer A. Asselin S. Lecourtois M. Chaffotte A. Schmitter J.M. Sobel A. Biochem. J. 1994; 300: 331-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The concentration of stathmin was determined by amino acid analysis. Video Microscopy—Purified tubulin (17 μm) was assembled onto the ends of sea urchin (Strongylocentrotus purpuratus) axoneme seeds at 30 °C in the presence and absence of stathmin in 87 mm Pipes, 36 mm Mes, 1.4 mm MgCl2, 1mm EGTA, pH 7.2 (PMME buffer) containing 2 mm GTP (20Walker R.A. O'Brien E.T. Pryer N.K. Soboeiro M.F. Voter W.A. Erickson H.P. Salmon E.D. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 107: 1437-1448Crossref PubMed Scopus (760) Google Scholar, 21Panda D. Jordan M.A. Chu K.C. Wilson L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29807-29812Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) and incubated at 30 °C for 40 min to achieve steady state. Attainment of true steady state of the seeded suspension was verified in the following way. Tubulin (17 μm) was added to a suspension of axoneme seeds at the same concentration used in the dynamic instability experiments, and the kinetics of microtubule assembly were determined both by light scattering at 350 nm and by sedimentation. The number concentration of axoneme seeds was ∼50 axonemes/μl, which by video microscopy resulted in 5–8 axonemes per field of view (300 μm2). There was a time-dependent increase in the microtubule polymer mass, with the plateau not reached until 35–40 min after initiation of assembly, after which the polymer level remained stable. We quantified the amount of soluble tubulin present once steady state had been achieved (40 min) after separating the pellet and supernatant by centrifugation and determined that the microtubule pellet contained 40% of the total tubulin. Thus, a large fraction of the initial soluble tubulin polymerized into microtubules in the seeded assembly system used for video analysis (data not shown). At steady state, the dynamics were significantly different from presteady-state conditions (supplemental data). The stathmin concentrations used were 1.7 and 3.4 μm, respectively. Time-lapse images of microtubule plus and minus ends were obtained at 30 °C by video-enhanced differential interference contrast microscopy. Growth rates, shortening rates, and transition frequencies were determined as previously described (21Panda D. Jordan M.A. Chu K.C. Wilson L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29807-29812Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Ends were designated as plus or minus on the basis of the growth rates, the number of microtubules that grew at opposite ends of the seeds, and the relative lengths of the microtubules (20Walker R.A. O'Brien E.T. Pryer N.K. Soboeiro M.F. Voter W.A. Erickson H.P. Salmon E.D. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 107: 1437-1448Crossref PubMed Scopus (760) Google Scholar, 21Panda D. Jordan M.A. Chu K.C. Wilson L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29807-29812Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). End designation was confirmed with Chlamydomonas flagella axonemes, which exhibit a bifurcation at their plus ends (40Gamblin T.C. Williams Jr., R.C. Anal. Biochem. 1995; 232: 43-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar) (data not shown). We considered microtubules to be growing if they increased in length >0.3 μm at a rate >0.3 μm/min. Shortening events were identified by a >1-μm length change at a rate >2 μm/min. Microtubules that changed <0.3 μm/min over a duration of 4 data points were considered to be in an attenuated state. Between 30 and 90 microtubules were analyzed for each condition. GTP Hydrolysis—Polymerization mixtures containing tubulin alone or a stathmin:tubulin molar ratio of 1: 5 were prepared exactly as in dynamic instability experiments. After 40 min of incubation at 30 °C, reactions were pulsed with [γ-32P]GTP. Samples were collected at 10-min intervals for 1 h and subjected to thin layer chromatography to separate [γ-32P]GTP from γ-32Pi. The amount of remaining [γ-32P]GTP was quantified by using a Bio-Rad Molceular Imager GS. Determination of the Critical Tubulin Subunit Concentration—Solutions of tubulin free of MAPs at either pH 6.8 or 7.2 at concentrations ranging from 2 to 20 μm containing either no stathmin (controls) or 2 μm stathmin in PMME buffer with 1.5 mm GTP were polymerized to steady state for 40 min at 37 °C. Polymerization was induced with 10% Me2SO. The microtubules were then sedimented by centrifugation at 150,000 × g at 35 °C for 1 h. Polymer pellets were re-suspended in ice-cold PMME buffer to depolymerize the microtubules. The amount of sedimented protein was determined and plotted against the initial tubulin concentration. The total soluble tubulin concentration for polymerization in the absence and presence of stathmin were determined from the x axis intercept of linear regression lines through each data set (41Panda D. Samuel S. Massie M. Feinstein S.C. Wilson L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 9548-9553Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). Stathmin Binding to Microtubules—We analyzed stathmin binding to microtubules by polymerizing purified tubulin (40 μm) with 4% glycerol seeds and stabilizing with 1 μm taxol. After 20 min, wild-type-stathmin (8 μm) or P16 stathmin was added to the preassembled microtubules, and incubation was continued for an additional 30 min. Microtubules were sedimented onto coverslips through 50% sucrose cushions containing 1 μm taxol. Coverslips were treated with a mixture of primary antibodies against α-tubulin (DM1A mouse monoclonal (1:500)) (Sigma) and stathmin (rabbit antiserum (1:200)) (Calbiochem) followed by the addition of secondary antibodies (donkey anti-mouse Cy3 and goat-anti-rabbit fluorescein). It was confirmed by Western blot analysis that the primary antibody against stathmin used in this experiment has similar affinity for both wild-type and P16 stathmin (not shown). Immunofluorescence images were obtained using Metamorph 4.6. For quantitation of stathmin binding to microtubules, tubulin (40 μm) and stathmin (8 μm) were assembled with 1% glycerol seeds in PMME buffer for 40 min at 37 °C. The microtubules were then sedimented through 30% sucrose cushions, and the pellets were resuspended and subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by Coomassie Blue staining. The amount of stathmin bound to the microtubules was determined by densitometric quantitative comparison with a known standard stathmin band by using EPI-CHMI darkroom scanner. The amount of protein in each pellet was determined before electrophoresis by a Bradford protein assay (42Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216357) Google Scholar), and the tubulin concentration was determined after subtraction of the quantity of bound stathmin. Control experiments with P16 stathmin (8 μm) were carried out in a similar manner. Treadmilling Rates—The treadmilling rate was determined by measuring the incorporation of [3H]GTP into MAP-rich microtubules at steady state using a glass fiber filter trapping assay (43Panda D. Chakrabarti G. Hudson J. Pigg K. Miller H.P. Wilson L. Himes R.H. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 5075-5081Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Microtubule protein (3 mg/ml) was polymerized to steady state for 30 min at 30 °C in 100 mm Pipes, 1 mm EGTA, and 1 mm MgS04, 0.02% sodium azide, pH 7.2 (PEM buffer) containing 0.1 mm GTP and a GTP regenerating system (10 mm acetyl phosphate and 1.5 unit/ml of acetate kinase). Incubations were carried out for an additional 25 min in the absence and presence of a 1:7 molar ratio of stathmin to tubulin. Then 600 μlofthe polymerized microtubule suspension was mixed with 15 μlof[3H]GTP (15 μCi). Portions of the suspension (40 μl each) were then removed over a 40-min time period and added to 4 ml of stabilizing buffer consisting of PEM containing 30% glycerol, 10% Me2SO, and 5.6 mm ATP to stabilize the microtubules. The stabilized microtubules were collected by filtration onto GF/F glass fiber filters, which were then washed and counted in a scintillation counter (“Experimental Procedures”). Samples were prepared for electron microscopy 25 min after the addition of stathmin to determine the microtubule mean lengths and the microtubule polymer mass. Samples for electron microscopy of the control were taken at the same time. Stathmin Increases the Steady-state Catastrophe Frequency Strongly and Preferentially at the Minus Ends at Physiological pH—We wanted to analyze the effects of stathmin on dynamic instability at physiological pH. We chose pH 7.2 because a sampling of published intracellular pH values ranged from a low of 7.0 (44Srivastava A. Krishnamoorthy G. Anal. Biochem. 1997; 249: 140-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) to a high of 7.4 (45Wong P. Kleemann H.W. Tannock I.F. Br. J. Cancer. 2002; 87: 238-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), and a comparison of reported pH values in 12 mammalian cell types yielded a mean pH of 7.20 ± 0.12 (44Srivastava A.

It has previously been shown that stathmin tubulin-sequestering activity decreases significantly as the pH is raised above pH 6.8 (38Curmi P.A. Andersen S.S. Lachkar S. Gavet O. Karsenti E.

To determine whether this occurs upon increasing the pH from 6.8 to 7.2 and how it affects the soluble tubulin concentration in the microtubule suspension, we assembled different concentrations of tubulin to polymer mass steady state in the absence and presence of 2 μm stathmin and determined the soluble tubulin concentration below which no microtubules could be detected (the tubulin subunit critical concentration, Cc). At pH 6.8 in the absence of stathmin, the soluble tubulin critical concentration was 2.07 μm. It has been shown that one molecule of stathmin can form a stable complex with two tubulin dimers in vitro, called a “T2S complex” (38Curmi P.A. Andersen S.S. Lachkar S. Gavet O. Karsenti E.

If stathmin can sequester tubulin efficiently under these conditions, the total soluble tubulin concentration should increase to 6 μm because 2 μm added stathmin would sequester 4 μm tubulin, preventing it from assembling into microtubules. As shown Fig. 1, at pH 6.8 the total soluble tubulin concentration did indeed increase by ∼4 μm (from 2.07 to 6 μm). Stathmin sequestered tubulin to a lesser degree at pH 7.2 than at pH 6.8. The total soluble tubulin concentration in the presence of 2 μm stathmin at pH 7.2 was increased by only ∼ 2.5 μm, from 2.61 to 5.09 μm (Fig. 1B), indicating that stathmin sequesters tubulin ∼40% less efficiently at"

We previously identified glycine hydrazide CFTR blockers that by electrophysiological studies appeared to block the CFTR anion pore at its lumen-facing surface. Here, we synthesize highly water-soluble, nonabsorbable malondihydrazides by coupling 2,4-disulfobenzaldehyde, 4-sulfophenylisothiocyante, and polyethylene glycol (PEG) moieties to 2-naphthalenylamino-[(3,5-dibromo-2,4-dihydroxyphenyl) methylene] propanedioic acid dihydrazide, and aminoacethydrazides by coupling PEG to [(N-2-naphthalenyl)-2-(2-hydroxyethyl)]-glycine-2-[(3,5-dibromo-2,4-dihydroxyphenyl) methylene] hydrazide. Compounds rapidly, fully and reversibly blocked CFTR-mediated chloride current with Ki of 2-8 microM when added to the apical surface of epithelial cell monolayers. Compounds did not pass across Caco-2 monolayers, and were absorbed by <2%/hr in mouse intestine. Luminally added compounds blocked by >90% cholera toxin-induced fluid secretion in mouse intestinal loops, without inhibiting intestinal fluid absorption. These orally administered, nonabsorbable, nontoxic CFTR inhibitors may reduce intestinal fluid losses in cholera."
https://openalex.org/W2011610125,"IκB kinase (IKK) catalytic subunits play a key role in cytokinemediated nuclear factor (NF)-κB signaling, and a loss of NF-κB function appears to inhibit inflammation and oncogenesis. Manumycin A is a potent and selective farnesyltransferase inhibitor with antitumor activity. We found that manumycin A caused a rapid and potent inhibition of IKK activity induced by tumor necrosis factor α in a number of cell types. Most unexpectedly, other classes of farnesyltransferase inhibitors had no inhibitory effect. To identify the molecular mechanisms of manumycin A action, cultured human HepG2 hepatoma cells were transiently transfected with various IKKα and IKKβ constructs, and a striking difference in manumycin A sensitivity was observed. Furthermore, cells expressing wild-type IKKβ and IKKβ mutated in the activation loop at Cys-179 exhibited covalent homotypic dimerization of IKKβ in response to manumycin A, whereas substitution of Cys-662 and -716 conferred protection against dimer formation. Direct inhibition of IKK activity and formation of stable IKKβ dimers were observed in the presence of manumycin A that could be blocked by dithiothreitol. IKK interaction with the adaptor protein IKKγ/NEMO was disrupted in manumycin A-treated cells. Most importantly, administration of manumycin A to mice xenografted with murine B16F10 tumors caused potent IKK-suppressive effects. Thus, manumycin A with its epoxyquinoid moieties plays an important regulatory function in IKK signaling through pathways distinct from its role as a protein farnesylation inhibitor."
https://openalex.org/W1983745167,"Expression of the δ-opioid receptor gene (dor) is tightly controlled during neuronal differentiation and developmental stages. Such distinct temporal and spatial expression of dor during development suggests a role for the δ-opioid receptor in early developmental events. However, little is known about intracellular signaling pathways that control dor expression. A well established cell line model for the study of gene expression during neuronal differentiation is the rat adrenal pheochromocytoma PC12 cell line. Here we found that the constitutively activated TrkA/phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt (protein kinase B)/NF-κB survival cascade mediates dor expression during nerve growth factor (NGF)-induced differentiation of PC12h cells. Biochemical experiments showed that constitutive phosphorylation of Akt and IκBα correlates with NGF-induced dor expression. Overexpression of the transcriptional activator NF-κB/p65 increased dor promoter activity. Overexpression of the NF-κB signaling super inhibitor mutant IκBα (S32A/S36A) abolished the effect of p65 and blocked NGF-induced activation of NF-κB signaling, resulting in a significant reduction in dor promoter activity. Treatment with SN50, an NF-κB-specific nuclear translocation peptide inhibitor, inhibited the translocation of NF-κB, resulting in a reduction of dor mRNA. The gel shift assay supported the fact that there exists an NF-κB-binding site on the dor promoter. RNA interference experiments using NF-κB/p65 small interfering RNA confirmed that NF-κB signaling is required for dor expression.

The opioid receptors belong to the rhodopsin family of the G protein-coupled receptor superfamily.

The δ-opioid receptor gene (dor) is temporally and spatially expressed in developmental stages (1Zhu Y. Hsu M.S. Pintar J.E. J.

Such distinct temporal and spatial patterns of dor expression during development suggest that DOR may have a role in early developmental events (1Zhu Y. Hsu M.S. Pintar J.E. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 2538-2549Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).A well established cell line model for the study of gene expression during neuronal development is the rat adrenal pheochromocytoma PC12 cell line (3Greene L.A. Tischler A.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1976; 73: 2424-2428Crossref PubMed Scopus (4826) Google Scholar). Nerve growth factor (NGF) could induce 10% of the total genes in PC12 cells (4Lee N.H. Weinstock K.G. Kirkness E.F. Earle-Hughes J.A. Fuldner R.A. Marmaros S. Glodek A. Gocayne J.D. Adams M.D. Kerlavage A.R. Fraser C.M. Venter J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8303-8307Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). NGF can significantly increase binding of the DOR agonist Met-enkephalin to the surface of PC12h (a PC12 subclone) cells in a time-dependent manner (5Inoue N. Hatanaka H. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 9238-9241Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Further studies indicated that NGF could enhance the dor mRNA level in PC12h cells (6Abood M.E. Tao Q. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1995; 274: 1566-1573PubMed Google Scholar). Despite the discovery of NGF induction of dor expression more than two decades ago, little is known about the intracellular signaling mechanism that mediates dor expression.NGF plays a critical role in the development and maintenance of the central nervous system and peripheral nervous system (7Sofroniew M.V. Howe C.L. Mobley W.C. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2001; 24: 1217-1281Crossref PubMed Scopus (1077) Google Scholar). During neuronal development, neurotrophins control the expression of many neuronal survival-associated genes, including the nuclear factor κB (NF-κB)-dependent bcl-xL gene (8Middleton G. Wyatt S. Ninkina N. Davies A.M. Development. 2001; 128: 447-457Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Such control is mainly mediated by activation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt (protein kinase B) signaling, which leads to the phosphorylation of downstream transcription factors, including NF-κB (9Brunet A. Datta S.R. Greenberg M.E. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2001; 11: 297-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (1003) Google Scholar, 10Yuan J. Yankner B.A. Nature. 2000; 407: 802-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (1594) Google Scholar). The DOR protein and its peptide agonists promote the survival of neurons in the central nervous system and the preserved peripheral organs (11Borlongan C.V. Wang Y. Su T.P. Front. Biosci. 2004; 9: 3392-3398Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Opioid ligands can activate PI3K/Akt survival signaling in the opioid receptor-transfected HEK293 cells (12Polakiewicz R.D.

Chem. 1998; 273: 23534-23541Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar), suggesting that the opioid survival effects may be attributable to activation of PI3K/Akt signaling. Moreover, the computer data base search indicated a putative NF-κB cis-element on the dor promoter (13Augustin L.B. Felsheim R.F. Min B.H. Fuchs S.M. Fuchs J.A. Loh H.H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 207: 111-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Taken together, we hypothesized that NGF-mediated PI3K/Akt signaling may be involved in the expression of the survival-associated dor gene during neuronal differentiation. As the first step of this investigation, we tested this hypothesis in the NGF-responsive PC12h cell model system.In this study, using specific signaling inhibitors and biological agents in combination with the small interfering RNA (siRNA) approach, we found that NGF receptor TrkA and the downstream PI3K/Akt signaling cascade, not the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), phospholipase Cγ, and protein kinase C signaling cascades, serves as the main pathway required for dor expression in the NGF-differentiated PC12h cell model. We further found that sustained activation of Akt and NF-κB is important for dor expression. Thus, this mechanism of NGF-induced dor expression may account in part for the temporal and spatial expression of dor during development.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCell Culture and Reagents—The PC12h cell line was a generous gift from Dr. Hiroshi Hatanaka. PC12h cells were grown and maintained in 1:1 Ham's F-12 medium/Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium plus 5% horse serum and 5% calf serum as described elsewhere (5Inoue N. Hatanaka H. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 9238-9241Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Nerve growth factor (2.5 S) was purchased from Harlan Bioproducts for Science, Inc. (Indianapolis, IN). LY294002, PD98059, K-252a, U-73122, bisindolylmaleimide I, and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) were purchased from Calbiochem (La Jolla, CA). Cell-permeable NF-κB inhibitory peptide SN50 and its mutant SN50M were purchased from both Biomol (Plymouth Meeting, PA) and Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). Anti-p50 (E-10), anti-p52 (C-5), and anti-p65 (F-6) monoclonal antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. Total RNA of the rat brain was purchased from Clontech (Palo Alto, CA).Plasmid Constructs—The dor promoter-containing reporter gene constructs pD1300 and pD262 were reported previously (14Liu H.C. Shen J.T. Augustin L.B. Ko J.L. Loh H.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23617-23626Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Multiple putative transcription initiation sites were located by RNase protection assay in a TATA-less G+C-rich sequence between 390 and 140 nucleotides upstream from the ATG translation start codon (13Augustin L.B. Felsheim R.F. Min B.H. Fuchs S.M. Fuchs J.A. Loh H.H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 207: 111-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The promoterless and enhancerless luciferase vector pGL3-basic was from Promega (Madison, WI). pNFKB-Luc is a reporter vector especially designed for monitoring activation of the NF-κB signaling pathway (Clontech). pNFKB-Luc contains multiple copies of the NF-κB consensus sequence (GGGAATTTCC) fused to a TATA-like promoter region from the Herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase promoter. The pCMV-IκBαM (IKBM) construct is an IκBα dominant-negative vector (Clontech). After IKBM is transfected into cells, expression of super inhibitor IκBα (S32A/S36A) mutant protein (IκBαM) results in specifically blocking NF-κB signaling in a particular cell line. Constructs pCMV4 and pCMV4/p65 are generous gifts from Dr. Warner C. Greene (University of California, San Francisco, CA).Transfection of PC12h Cells and Reporter Gene Assay—PC12h cells (8 × 105 cells/60-mm dish) were transiently cotransfected for 3 h with 2.5 pmol of individual DNA constructs and a 1:5 molar ratio of pCH110 plasmid (Amersham Biosciences) or 0.5 μgof Renilla luciferase expression vector pRL-TK (Promega) using SuperFect® or Effectene® transfection reagent (Qiagen) unless otherwise noted. The transfection was carried out according to the manufacturer's protocols. After transfection, the cells were cultured for 48 h in a Ham's F-12 medium/Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (1:1) containing 10 μg/ml of insulin, 6.7 ng/ml of selenium, and 5.5 ng/ml of transferrin with or without 50 ng/ml of NGF. The cells were harvested, lysed, and assayed for luciferase activities using a luciferase reporter assay system (Promega) according to the manufacturer's protocols. The net luciferase activity of each plasmid was obtained by subtraction of the activity of the empty vector pGL3-basic from the total activity of each plasmid. The differences in transfection efficiency from dish to dish were corrected by using Renilla luciferase orβ-galactosidase activities of each lysate sample. In addition, the protein concentration of each sample was determined by using a Pierce BCA protein assay kit. The relative luciferase activity was normalized to correct the difference in the amount of protein used for each assay.Western Blot Analysis of Phosphorylation of Akt and IκBα—The proteins from cell lysates were separated on 10% SDS-PAGE gels and blotted onto nitrocellular membranes according to the manufacturer's protocols (Cell Signaling, Beverly, MA). Phosphorylated Akt and IκBα as well as unphosphorylated Akt and IκBα on the membranes were then probed by anti-p-Akt (Ser473), anti-p-IκBα (Ser32), anti-Akt, and anti-IκBα according to the manufacturer's protocol (Cell Signaling), respectively. Identification and quantification of protein bands were as described previously (15Chen Y.L. Law P.Y. Loh H.H. Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 8723-8730Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) unless otherwise noted.Reverse Transcription (RT)-PCR of the Endogenous dor Gene—Total RNA was isolated from PC12h cells using a TRI Reagent® kit (Molecular Research Center, Cincinnati, OH). RT-PCR was performed on 4 μgof total RNA using a Qiagen One-step RT-PCR kit with specific primers. A primer set specifically for the dor gene was used to produce a 365-bp product as described previously (16Wittert G. Hope P. Pyle D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 218: 877-881Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). For the dor transcripts, semiquantitative RT-PCR was carried out by a standard protocol from the Qiagen kit: reverse transcription at 50 °C for 30 min; initial PCR activation at 95 °C for 15 min; 39–43 cycles at 94 °C for 0.5 min, 55 °C for 0.75 min, and 72 °C for 1 min; and finally 72 °C for 10 min. Because the glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) mRNA level did not change with NGF treatment (4Lee N.H. Weinstock K.G. Kirkness E.F. Earle-Hughes J.A. Fuldner R.A. Marmaros S. Glodek A. Gocayne J.D. Adams M.D. Kerlavage A.R. Fraser C.M. Venter J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8303-8307Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar), the GAPDH RT-PCR product served as an internal control for normalization. Equal aliquots of PCRs were analyzed on a 2% agarose gel and photographed by a Kodak Digital Science DC120 Zoom digital camera. Semi-quantitative analysis of the RT-PCR products was carried out by using ImageQuant software (Amersham Biosciences). The dor-specific signal was normalized to the GAPDH-specific signal in each reaction to obtain a value of relative fluorescence intensity.Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay—The recombinant transcription factor NF-κB (p50) protein and activating protein-1, NF-κB, and octamer transcription factor 1 consensus double-stranded oligonucleotides were purchased from Promega. Single-stranded oligonucleotides were synthesized by Integrated DNA Technologies, Inc. The probe used was a double-stranded oligonucleotide DorNFκB containing a putative NF-κB cis-element on the dor promoter. The probe was labeled at the 5′-end with 32P by the T4 DNA polynucleotide kinase using the labeling kit from Promega. The probe and other oligonucleotide sequences are listed in Table 1. Cells treated with NGF for different periods of time were harvested, and cytosolic proteins and nuclear proteins were extracted according to the modified protocol of Dignam and Roeder (17Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Chanda V.B. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. 2. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1993Google Scholar). The protein concentrations were determined by using the Pierce BCA protein assay kit. For each binding reaction, 70 fmol of the 32P-labeled probe (50,000–90,000 cpm) were incubated with 0.4 gel shift unit of NF-κB p50 protein or 10 μg of PC12h cytosolic or nuclear protein extracts at room temperature for 20 min (a gel shift unit was defined by Promega as the amount of p50 required to shift 0.38 pmol of the NF-κB oligonucleotide under the manufacturer's conditions). The binding buffer contained 4% glycerol, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 50 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl, and 0.05 mg/ml of poly(dI-dC)·poly(dI-dC) for nuclear extracts. When the recombinant NF-κB p50 was used, the binding buffer was 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.9) containing 50 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 2.5 mm dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol, and 0.05% Nonidet P-40. For the immunoshift experiment, 4 μgof mouse monoclonal antibodies (anti-p50, anti-p52, and anti-p65) against the NF-κB subunits p50, p52, and p65 were added, respectively, to the reaction for an additional 20 min.TABLE 1Sense sequences of the probes and competitorsProbe/competitorsSense sequenceAP-15′-CGCTTGATGACTCAGCCGGAADorNFκB5′-GCGGCTCGGGGCTCCCCGGGCT(-172 to -151)DorNFκBmt5′-GCGGCTCTGCTCTCCCCGGGCT(-172 to -151)NF-κB5′-AGTTGAGGGGACTTTCCCAGGCOCT-15′-TGTCGAATGCAAATCACTAGAA Open table in a new tab RNA Interference—PC12h cells in 60-mm dishes were transfected with NF-κB/p65 siRNAs (siRNA SMARTpool™ p65, MQ-080033-00, and SMARTselected duplexes, MQ-080033-00-0005; Dharmacon, Lafayette, CO) following the Lipofectamine 2000 protocol from the manufacturer (Invitrogen). A nonspecific siRNA control pool (D-001206-13-05; Dharmacon) was used as a negative control. The sequences of the four p65 SMARTselected duplexes are: UCAAGAGCAUCAUGAAGAAUU (S1), GCAGUUCGAUGCUGAUGAAUU (S2), GAAGAGUCCUUUCAAUGGAUU (S3), and GGAGUACCCUGAAGCUAUAUU (S4). Specific reduction of the targeted p65 expression level was confirmed by Western blot analysis using anti-p65 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology).Statistical Analysis—One-way analysis of variance was performed for statistical significance evaluation using the GraphPad Prism™ program. Either Dunnett's or Student's test was used to determine whether or not the sample was significantly different from the control. Statistically significant differences between samples and controls are indicated by single (p < 0.05), double (p < 0.01), and triple asterisks (p < 0.001).RESULTSTime-dependent Induction of dor Expression by NGF in PC12h Cells— To investigate the effect of NGF on the dor mRNA level, PC12h cells were treated with 100 ng/ml NGF for a time period of 48 h. RT-PCR analysis was carried out using the One-step RT-PCR kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's protocol under semi-quantitative experimental conditions as shown in Fig. 1 (A and B). NGF induced dor mRNA at about 4 h, and a significant increase in dor mRNA was observed at 24 h (Fig. 1C). At 48 h, NGF treatment of PC12h cells resulted in a 3.8-fold increase in the dor mRNA (Dunnett's test, p < 0.001) (Fig. 1D). This level of dor mRNA is comparable with that in the rat brain (Fig. 1D). NGF also induced expression of the dor gene in parental PC12 cells, although with a lower induction fold (data not shown). Thus, in this study only the subclone PC12h cells were used.Inhibition of TrkA/PI3K Signaling Resulted in Blockage of dor Expression—Both NGF receptors TrkA and p75ntr are expressed in PC12 cells, but TrkB and TrkC are not (18Ip N.Y. Stitt T.N. Tapley P. Klein R. Glass D.J. Fandl J. Greene L.A. Barbacid M. Yancopoulos G.D. Neuron. 1993; 10: 137-149Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar, 19Tsoulfas P. Soppet D. Escandon E. Tessarollo L. Mendoza-Ramirez J.L. Rosenthal A. Nikolics K. Parada L.F. Neuron. 1993; 10: 975-990Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). Generally, the high affinity NGF receptor TrkA is the main target of NGF in PC12 cells, although the low affinity NGF receptor p75ntr can also directly interact with NGF (20Chao M.V. Hempstead B.L. Trends Neurosci. 1995; 18: 321-326Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (771) Google Scholar). Hence, either of these neurotrophin receptors could be involved in NGF-induced up-regulation of dor mRNA. TrkA is a tyrosine receptor kinase that autophosphorylates itself upon activation by NGF, but p75ntr does not have such a kinase domain (20Chao M.V. Hempstead B.L. Trends Neurosci. 1995; 18: 321-326Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (771) Google Scholar). Treatment of the cells with 50 nm K-252a, a Trk-specific tyrosine kinase inhibitor that does not affect other growth factor-induced tyrosine kinase activities (21Tapley P. Lamballe F. Barbacid M. Oncogene. 1992; 7: 371-381PubMed Google Scholar), completely blocked NGF-induced up-regulation of both dor mRNA (Fig. 2A) and the activity of dor promoter-driven reporter pD1300, which contains the 5′-flanking sequence from –1.3K to +1 of the dor promoter (translational start site designated as +1) (14Liu H.C.

Furthermore, if NGF up-regulation of dor promoter activity had been mediated through direct activation of p75ntr, BDNF treatment might have had similar effect on promoter activity because both NGF and BDNF have similar binding affinities to p75ntr (20Chao M.V. Hempstead B.L. Trends Neurosci. 1995; 18: 321-326Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (771) Google Scholar). When PC12h cells were transfected with pD1300 and stimulated with BDNF for 48 h, the BDNF-induced dor promoter activity was not significant in comparison with the control (p > 0.05) (Fig. 2B). The BDNF result indicates that p75ntr is not directly involved in the activation of dor promoter activity. Thus, the K-252a and BDNF results together suggest that NGF acts via TrkA to up-regulate dor expression.FIGURE 2NGF induction of dor mRNA and promoter activity via TrkA/PI3K signaling.

Neurobiol. 2001; 11: 272-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (906) Google Scholar). Activation of PI3K/Akt survival signaling leads to phosphorylation of several important proteins in the regulation of cell survival in neurons (22Patapoutian A. Reichardt L.F. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2001; 11: 272-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (906) Google Scholar). One of them is IκB, which is the cytoplasmic inhibitor of NF-κB (23Baeuerle P.A. Baltimore D. Science. 1988; 242: 540-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (1678) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of IκB initiates proteasome-dependent protein degradation and allows NF-κB to enter the nucleus to regulate NF-κB-dependent gene expression (24Baeuerle P.A. Baltimore D. Cell. 1996; 87: 13-20Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2918) Google Scholar). We then asked which downstream effector(s) transmits NGF/TrkA signaling to the nucleus to activate dor expression. After surveying the effect of an array of kinase inhibitors on NGF-induced dor promoter activity, we were able to identify that the PI3K signaling pathway, not the phospholipase C and protein kinase C signaling pathways, is mainly responsible for NGF/TrkA signaling-dependent dor expression (Fig. 2C). As shown in Fig. 2C, treatment with PI3K inhibitor LY294002 (25Vlahos C.J. Matter W.F. Hui K.Y. Brown R.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5241-5248Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) resulted in a significant 72% reduction in dor promoter activity (p < 0.0001). PD98059 at 20μm, which is a MAPK kinase inhibitor (26Dudley D.T. Pang L. Decker S.J. Bridges A.J. Saltiel A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The result from analysis of the change in the dor mRNA level (Fig. 2D) is consistent with the results from the functional analysis of dor promoter activity (Fig. 2C).Fast Phosphorylation of Akt and IκBα and Slow Dephosphorylation of Phosphorylated Akt by NGF in PC12h Cells—To confirm that activation of PI3K signaling correlates with the PI3K signaling-dependent dor expression described above, we evaluated the phosphorylation status of PI3K downstream effectors Akt and IκBα in NGF-treated PC12h cells. NGF treatment resulted in an increase in phosphorylation of Akt at serine 473. The p-Akt peaked at 15–30 min, was slowly dephosphorylated, and sustained at a significant level for 48 h (p < 0.05; Fig. 3, A and B). We also observed that a transient decrease in the Akt protein level occurred after cells were treated with NGF for 30 min to 4 h (Fig. 3A). Meanwhile, phosphorylation of IκBα at Ser32 also peaked at 15 min, but the rate of dephosphorylation was quicker than that of p-Akt (Fig. 3, A and B). Subsequently, the decrease in IκBα occurred between 30 min and 4 h. Treatment with PI3K inhibitor LY294002 resulted in a significant reduction in p-Akt and its downstream effector p-IκBα at 48 h (p < 0.05; Fig. 3C), indicating that the constitutive phosphorylation of Akt and IκBα may play a critical role in NGF/PI3K signaling-dependent dor expression.FIGURE 3Western blot analysis of total and phosphorylated protein levels of Akt and IκBα in PC12h cells.

LY294002 treatment decreased the p-Akt (Ser473) level and p-IκBα (Ser32) level, suggesting that NF-κB signaling may be involved in NGF/PI3K/Akt-dependent dor expression. A previous computer data base search also indicated that a putative NF-κB-binding site was located in the 5′-flanking region (–172 to –151; see Table 1 for sequence) of the dor promoter (13Augustin L.B.

To test the involvement of NF-κB signaling in dor expression, we carried out a series of experiments as summarized in Fig. 4.

The initiation of eukaryotic DNA replication requires the activation of two Ser/Thr protein kinases, an S phase cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) 3The abbreviations used are: CDK, cyclin-dependent kinase; DDK, Dbf4-dependent kinase; SPM, sporulation medium; DAPI, 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindol; SPB, spindle pole body; PFGE, pulsed-field gel electrophoresis; FACS, fluorescence-activated cell sorter. and a Dbf4-dependent kinase (DDK), named Cdc7 in budding yeast (1Woo R.A. Poon R.Y. Cell Cycle. 2003; 2: 316-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). The Cdc7-Dbf4 kinase, which is conserved from yeast to human (2Masai H. Arai K. J. Cell. Physiol. 2002; 190: 287-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar), is responsible for a late step in replication origin firing, locally and throughout S phase (3Bousset K. Diffley J.F.

Cdc7-Dbf4 is also a target and transducer of the ATR-dependent S phase checkpoint in yeast and vertebrates (5Duncker B.P. Brown G.W. Mutat.

Besides its role in origin firing, Cdc7 has also been implicated in induced mutagenesis and meiotic recombination (2Masai H. Arai K. J. Cell. Physiol. 2002; 190: 287-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Dbf4 is the Cdc7 kinase regulatory subunit, an unstable protein that accumulates in late G1, binds to replication origins, and guides Cdc7 kinase activity toward specific subunits of the pre-initiation complex (7Dowell S.J. Romanowski P. Diffley J.F. Science. 1994; 265: 1243-1246Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar, 8Pasero P. Duncker B.P. Schwob E. Gasser S.M.

Despite its well characterized function for DNA replication in the mitotic cell cycle, little is known on the role of DDK during meiosis. Original experiments using a temperature-sensitive cdc7 allele concluded that it was essential neither for pre-meiotic DNA replication nor for ARS1 origin firing (11Schild D. Byers B. Chromosoma. 1978; 70: 109-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 12Hollingsworth Jr., R.E. Sclafani R.A. Chromosoma. 1993; 102: 415-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), leading to the idea that the mechanisms controlling DNA replication could be different in mitosis and meiosis. Hence several conserved initiation proteins (SpCdc18/Cdc6, Mcm2, and Mcm4) were found dispensable for pre-meiotic S phase in fission yeast (13Forsburg S.L. Hodson J.A. Nat. Genet. 2000; 25: 263-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), but more recent results using tighter mutants did not confirm this conclusion (14Murakami H. Nurse P. Nat.

Furthermore, the same replication origins are generally used in mitosis and meiosis and acted upon by the same CDK complex in both cell types (17Collins I. Newlon C.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 3524-3534Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 18Benjamin K.R. Zhang C. Shokat K.M. Herskowitz I.

In fact, Cdc7's dispensability for meiotic replication appeared as an exception and its precise function deserved further examination. In this paper we reinvestigate the role of Cdc7-Dbf4 during meiosis. Contrary to initial reports, we show that Dbf4 is essential for pre-meiotic DNA replication and that no DNA synthesis occurs in its absence, as observed in mitosis. Furthermore we provide evidence that in addition to its role in origin firing, Dbf4 is also required after S phase to complete the first meiotic division, thus uncovering a novel and unexpected function of DDK for chromosome segregation during meiosis.

Open table in a new tab Cells were grown in YEP medium (1% yeast extract, 2% bacto-peptone) supplemented with 50 mg of adenine per liter and 2% dextrose (YEPD). Sporulation was performed as described (22Cha R.S. Weiner B.M. Keeney S. Dekker J. Kleckner N. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 493-503PubMed Google Scholar). YPA was 1% yeast extract, 2% bacto-peptone, and 1% potassium acetate. Sporulation medium (SPM) contained 1% potassium acetate with the required amino acid. For synchronous liquid sporulation cells were grown at 30 °C in YEPD to late exponential stage (0.8-1.2 × 106 cells/ml) and transferred overnight (no more than 12 h) at 30 °C in pre-sporulation medium (YPA) to obtain a concentration of ∼2 × 107 cells/ml. Then cells were washed twice in water and incubated in SPM with vigorous shaking at 30 °C. For depletion experiments of Fig. 2, a low concentration of doxycycline (1 μg/ml) was added into pre-sporulation medium (YPA) to reduce the level of the expression of the Tet-DBF4 transcript to the wild-type level by the time cells were shifted to sporulation medium. The number of asci (tetrads and dyads) was measured by light microscopy 24 or 48 h after transfer in SPM; an average of 200 cells were counted for each experimental condition. Centrifugal Elutriation—Cells were grown as described above into one liter of YPA to a concentration of ∼2 × 107 cells/ml. Cells were then resuspended in 50 ml of YPA, sonicated, and pumped into a 40-ml elutriation chamber at about 50 ml/min with a rotor speed of 3000 rpm. Cells were kept at 25 °C during the centrifugation and eluted at constant flow decreasing gradually rotor speed. Elutriated G1 cells were collected, washed twice in water, and dissolved in SPM to a concentration of ∼3 × 107 cells/ml and incubated at 30 °C with vigorous shaking. Analysis of Gene and Protein Expression—Total RNA isolation and Northern analysis were performed as described (23Cross F.R. Tinkelenberg A.H. Cell. 1991; 65: 875-883Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar) with 20 μg of RNA per lane. RNAs were stained with SybrGold and visualized using an image plate scanner (Typhoon, Amersham Biosciences). DNA probes were prepared by random priming of open reading frame PCR products, amplified from genomic DNA, and labeled according to the NEBlot protocol (New England Biolabs). Protein extracts were prepared from trichloroacetic acid-fixed cells, and analyzed by Western blot as described previously (10Nougarède R. Della Seta F. Zarzov P. Schwob E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 3795-3806Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Fluorescence Microscopy—Cells were fixed 15 min at 25 °C in 4% paraformaldehyde added to the medium. Cells were washed twice with potassium phosphate buffer (KPO4) and resuspended in 100 μl of phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.5, containing 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindol (DAPI) and incubated for at least 30 min. Cells were subsequently washed in phosphate-buffered saline for microscopy. Epifluorescence microscopy was performed with a 63× objective on a Leica DMRA microscope equipped with a CoolSNAP HQ CCD camera (Roper Scientific). MetaMorph Imaging System v.4.5 (Universal Imaging Corp.) was used for image analysis. Pulsed-field Gel Electrophoresis and DNA Quantification—Yeast cells were embedded in low melting agarose plugs (5 × 107 cells/plug), and genomic DNA was extracted as described (24Lengronne A. Pasero P. Bensimon A. Schwob E. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 1433-1442Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Yeast chromosomes were separated by PFGE (Gene Navigator, AP Biotec). The gel was stained with SybrGold (1:10,000, Molecular Probes) and scanned with a FluorImager (Typhoon) and signals analyzed with ImageQuant (Amersham Biosciences). The amount of replicated DNA was estimated measuring the re-emergence from the gel wells of fully replicated chromosomes from nine representative chromosomal bands, and the average value was plotted on a graph considering the diploid DNA content as 100%. Dbf4 Is Required for Pre-meiotic DNA Replication—We inactivated Cdc7 during meiosis by depleting its unstable regulatory subunit, Dbf4, by shutting off its transcription from a repressible tetracycline promoter (pTET-off) (10Nougarède R. Della Seta F. Zarzov P. Schwob E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 3795-3806Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). By adding doxycycline to the medium at different times, it is possible to inactivate Cdc7 at different stages of meiotic progression (Fig. 1A). Because Dbf4 degradation is gradual after transcriptional shut-off, doxycycline was added 3 h before shifting the cells to sporulation medium, to achieve full Dbf4 depletion at the beginning of meiosis. Any potential detrimental effect of doxycycline was ruled out by showing that a wild-type strain progresses through meiosis and sporulates normally whether in the presence or absence of the drug (Fig. 1B). We first determined the effect of shutting off one DBF4 allele in a heterozygous DBF4/pTET-DBF4 strain (Fig. 1C, middle). Northern blot analysis confirmed that DBF4 expression was reduced compared with wild type. Despite this, the kinetics of pre-meiotic DNA replication and the induction of meiosis-specific genes were normal indicating that one copy of DBF4 is sufficient for pre-meiotic DNA replication. However, the percentage of mature tetrads was decreased from 74% in the control strain to only 28%, suggesting that decreased DBF4 dosage has a more pronounced effect on sporulation than on S phase. When both DBF4 alleles were shut off in a strain homozygous for the pTET-DBF4 construct, DBF4 mRNAs were no longer detectable, and importantly, no DNA synthesis was detected in these cells. This was not due to a failure to enter the meiotic program as early DMC1 transcripts accumulated at normal levels in these cells (Fig. 1C, right, and data not shown). However, middle and late transcripts did not build up and only 5% of asci were formed, suggesting a block in meiotic progression. These data demonstrate that DBF4 is required for pre-meiotic DNA replication. Although unlikely, it is conceivable that Dbf4 might function in premeiotic S phase independently of Cdc7. To verify that Cdc7 itself is necessary for this process, we sought for temperatures at which DNA replication would be affected in a homozygous cdc7-1ts strain but not in wild type. Hence we monitored DNA synthesis and sporulation efficiency at 25, 30, and 34 °C, using the SK1 genetic background that is less heat-sensitive for meiosis. At 30 °C, the cdc7-1 strain progressed more slowly through S phase compared with wild type, while at 34 °C premeiotic DNA replication was affected also in the wild-type strain (Fig. 2). This suggests that the cdc7-1 strain is defective for DNA replication but retains some activity at 30 °C. Again, sporulation was more affected than DNA replication, being completely defective at 30 °C in the cdc7-1ts strain. Thus both DBF4 and CDC7 seem necessary for DNA replication in meiosis, as during the vegetative cell cycle. Dbf4 Is Required for Completion of the First Meiotic Division—CDC7 was originally reported to be dispensable for pre-meiotic DNA replication but required for synaptonemal complex formation and commitment to recombination, possibly indicative of a role after S phase (11Schild D. Byers B. Chromosoma. 1978; 70: 109-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 25Simchen G. Genetics. 1974; 76: 745-753Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To see whether such a function could be detected for Dbf4, we took advantage of the pTET-DBF4 strain to deplete DBF4 at different times along meiotic progression, which we describe hereafter as delayed Dbf4 depletion (Fig. 1A). Because the kinetics of meiosis depend heavily on the history and environment of the cell, all following experiments started with the same preculture, which was split only at the time of meiotic induction. Hence the consequences of shutting off DBF4 expression by adding doxycycline at time T0, T2h, and T4h after shift to sporulation medium were compared with a culture expressing DBF4 constitutively (No Dox). Ectopic DBF4 expression did not significantly alter pre-meiotic DNA replication and sporulation by 24 h was quite efficient, giving rise to 94% mature asci (37% dyads + 57% tetrads). When doxycycline was added at T0 or later, Dbf4 levels decreased but remained high enough to sustain efficient DNA replication in all cultures (Fig. 3, A and C). Sporulation, however, was seriously affected when doxycycline was added at T0 but not at later times. Dbf4 became undetectable by 3 h, DNA replication was completed by 4 h, but 63% of the cells nevertheless failed to form mature spores. Fluorescence microscopy showed that most cells contained a single nuclear mass, indicative of an arrest before the first meiotic division (Fig. 3B). When doxycycline was added at T2h, Dbf4 levels decreased by 4 h, but this did not affect meiotic progression and sporulation. These results suggest that a critical level of Dbf4 is still required after pre-meiotic DNA replication to complete meiosis I but might not be required after this stage. Delayed Dbf4 Depletion Arrests Cells after Pachytene—To better characterize the arrest induced by delayed Dbf4 depletion, we used a strain that in addition to pTET-DBF4 expresses SPC42-GFP and TUB1-CFP enabling us to follow SPB separation and spindle morphology throughout meiosis. Doxycycline was added at T0, which allowed S phase to take place, albeit slightly slower than without depletion (Fig. 4A). As above, most cells arrested before meiosis I, and after 24 h in sporulation medium, only 18% of mature asci were scored (DBF4off) compared with 88% when Dbf4 was expressed (DBF4on). The remaining cells could be subdivided in five classes depending on the presence of one, two, or four nuclear masses and on the extent of SPB separation (Fig. 4B). In the control culture (DBF4on), 85% of the cells became tetranucleated (class V) indicating completion of the two meiotic divisions in most cells. Conversely 60% of the cells (classes II and III) failed to progress beyond anaphase I after Dbf4 depletion (DBF4off). Class II (24%) showed duplicated but coalescent Spc42-GFP spots, whereas class III (36%) exhibited separated SPBs with a short spindle characteristic of metaphase I. 16% of the cells (class I) showed a single nuclear mass with a single SPB, probably representing cells that did not replicate. Finally, only 24% of the cells reached the binucleated or tetranucleated stage (classes IV and V) presumably representing cells in which Dbf4 depletion occurred too late. Thus the majority of cells (60%) depleted of Dbf4 after DNA synthesis arrest with separated SPBs (class II and III). This corresponds to a post-pachytene stage as ndt80Δ mutants, which arrest at pachytene with duplicated but side-by-side spindle pole bodies (26Xu L. Ajimura M. Padmore R. Klein C. Kleckner N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6572-6581Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar), show only a single Spc42-GFP spot (data not shown). Arrest Is Not Due to Incomplete DNA Replication or Faulty Recombination—Partial or defective replication is detected during meiosis by a replication checkpoint that stops cell division (21Stuart D. Wittenberg C. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2698-2710Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Since S phase was slightly extended under conditions of delayed Dbf4 depletion, we envisaged the possibility that the meiosis I arrest was a consequence of activating the S phase or recombination checkpoints. Hence we tested whether this arrest was dependent on the DNA damage checkpoint genes RAD17, RAD24, and MEC1 (supplemental Fig. S1) or on the spindle checkpoint gene MAD2 (E2346, data not shown) and found that deletion of neither of these genes bypassed the arrest. To check that DNA replication went to completion, we quantified the amount of chromosomal DNA by fluorography using the more sensitive technique of pulse field gel electrophoresis (24Lengronne A. Pasero P. Bensimon A. Schwob E. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 1433-1442Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). By this approach, only fully replicated chromosomes migrate in the gel, while replication and recombination intermediates remain trapped in the well. To circumvent the recombination problem we used a strain deleted for SPO11, which encodes the trans-esterase required for double-strand break formation and recombination (27Keeney S. Curr. Top. Dev. Biol. 2001; 52: 1-53Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Chromosomes from spo11 mutants do not undergo meiotic recombination (28Klapholz S. Waddell C.S. Esposito R.E. Genetics. 1985; 110: 187-216Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), allowing their separation by PFGE. The quantification of individual chromosomes resolved in PFGE showed a precise doubling, indicating that S phase was completed after delayed Dbf4 depletion, albeit slightly later than in the control culture (supplemental Fig. S2). Furthermore, the deletion of SPO11 did not bypass the meiosis I arrest induced by Dbf4 depletion, indicating that it is also not caused by defective or delayed recombination or subsequent DNA repair (Fig. 4C, right). Delayed Dbf4 Depletion in the spo11Δ Strain Produces Viable Spores— Despite the lack of recombination, spo11 mutants are able to complete meiosis and produce tetrads, even though the spores are non-viable due to random segregation of homologues at the first division (28Klapholz S. Waddell C.S. Esposito R.E. Genetics. 1985; 110: 187-216Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 29Shonn M.A. McCarroll R. Murray A.W. Science. 2000; 289: 300-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Depletion of Dbf4 in spo11 mutants produced only 17% of dyads, but surprisingly 87% of spores from these dyads were viable (Fig. 3C, right). Remarkably these spores turned out to be MATa/MATα diploids, indicating that they were the product of an equational division. This result suggests that delayed Dbf4 depletion prevents mono-orientation of sister kinetochores at meiosis I, a phenotype reminiscent of that produced by the depletion of the polo-like kinase Cdc5 (30Clyne R.K. Katis V.L. Jessop L. Benjamin K.R. Herskowitz I. Lichten M. Nasmyth K. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 480-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar, 31Lee B.H. Amon A. Science. 2003; 300: 482-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Deletion of REC8 Suppresses DBF4-dependent Arrest—The absence of Cdc5, like that of Dbf4, leads to a normal progression of the early meiotic events but causes a failure at anaphase I. cdc5 mutants accumulate hypophosphorylated forms of the meiotic cohesin Rec8, which fails to be degraded (30Clyne R.K. Katis V.L. Jessop L. Benjamin K.R. Herskowitz I. Lichten M. Nasmyth K. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 480-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar, 31Lee B.H. Amon A. Science. 2003; 300: 482-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar) and prevents the proper resolution of chiasmata and the separation of homologues during meiosis I (32Buonomo S.B. Clyne R.K. Fuchs J. Loidl J. Uhlmann F. Nasmyth K. Cell. 2000; 103: 387-398Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar). In addition, Cdc5 depletion prevents the association of the monopolin Mam1 with kinetochores, causing an abnormal bi-orientation of sister chromatids at meiosis I. Considering the similar phenotypes induced by Cdc5 and Dbf4 depletion, we investigated whether a persistent cohesion could be responsible for the Dbf4-dependent arrest. If, as for Cdc5, loss of Dbf4 interfered with both cohesin cleavage and chromatid mono-orientation, we would expect chromosomes to fully segregate in Dbf4-depleted spo11 rec8 cells. Deletion of REC8 should allow cells to undergo a first division, but not efficient sporulation, as seen previously for rec8 mutants (33Klein F. Mahr P. Galova M. Buonomo S.B. Michaelis C. Nairz K. Nasmyth K. Cell. 1999; 98: 91-103Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (575) Google Scholar). This prediction was entirely satisfied by the experiment. The formation of bi-nucleated cells (meiosis I) in spo11Δ rec8Δ cells was no longer affected by the depletion of Dbf4 (Fig. 5A). This indicates that cells depleted for Dbf4 after S phase arrest before anaphase I mainly because they bi-orient their sister chromatids without being able to dissolve the cohesive links between them (Fig. 5B). The meiotic division is a differentiation program precisely controlled by the action of protein kinases (34Honigberg S.M. J. Cell. Biochem. 2004; 92: 1025-1033Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Regulatory circuits check the occurrence of the specific meiotic division (meiose I) that should be coordinated with DNA replication and recombination to produce the correct segregation of homologous chromosomes into the gametes (35Marston A.L. Amon A. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 5: 983-997Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). The present study demonstrates that Cdc7-Dbf4 is required during the early stages of meiosis to initiate DNA replication. These data contrast with earlier findings that suggested that CDC7 was not required for pre-meiotic DNA replication. This discrepancy could be due to the fact that initial investigations on meiotic functions of CDC7 used temperature-sensitive alleles (11Schild D. Byers B. Chromosoma. 1978; 70: 109-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). As meiosis itself is inhibited at elevated temperatures, the results obtained were likely to suffer a strong experimental bias. To avoid this caveat we inactivated Cdc7 by depleting its unstable regulatory subunit Dbf4. Using this approach we demonstrate that pre-meiotic DNA replication depends on Cdc7/Dbf4 activity (DDK). In budding yeast, pre-meiotic DNA replication is triggered by the same S phase CDKs that act in mitosis (18Benjamin K.R. Zhang C. Shokat K.M. Herskowitz I. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 1524-1539Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar, 20Dirick L. Goetsch L. Ammerer G. Byers B. Science. 1998; 281: 1854-1857Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 21Stuart D. Wittenberg C. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2698-2710Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). These data combined with our results strongly suggest that mitosis and meiosis share a common mechanism for the activation of the origins of DNA replication. In addition to the replication function, we show that Dbf4 has a second role during meiosis. Indeed, in the absence of Dbf4 cells arrest before the first meiotic division suggesting a possible role of Dbf4 in setting up the specific chromosome segregation during meiosis. Two experimental observations confirmed this hypothesis. First, although in the absence of Dbf4 most of the cells did not carry out anaphase, a few cells eventually divided their nuclei. However, they produced only two diploid spores instead of four haploid gametes. This indicated that an equational, instead of the normal reductional division, occurred. Second, deletion of Rec8 restored the nuclear division despite the absence of Dbf4, suggesting that the loss of Dbf4 may cause persistence of Rec8 cohesion. On the basis of these observations, we propose the following model (Fig. 5B). The absence of Dbf4 causes both kinetochore bipolar orientation and cohesion persistence between sister chromatides. Therefore, spindle fibers pull chromosomes to the opposite cell poles, while Rec8 cohesion persists, causing an arrest of chromosome separation. This arrest is bypassed by the deletion of REC8 that allows chromosomes to separate. This model can account for the arrest observed in the absence of Dbf4 and the failure of the subsequent anaphase. Our results thus give evidence that Dbf4 plays an unexpected but important role for the first meiotic division. This new meiotic function for Dbf4 is in agreement with literature reports as paralogs and orthologs of DBF4 and CDC7 have been reported to play distinct biological functions in other organisms. In fission yeast, a second Cdc7-Dbf4-related complex (Spo4-Spo6) is required for chromosome segregation during the second meiotic division but dispensable in mitosis (36Nakamura T. Nakamura-Kubo M. Shimoda C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 309-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). A role distinct to replication initiation has been ascribed to the fission yeast Cdc7 ortholog Hsk1, specifically for the formation of centromeric heterochromatin and sister chromatid cohesion (37Bailis J.M. Bernard P. Antonelli R. Allshire R.C. Forsburg S.L. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 1111-1116Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 38Snaith H.A. Brown G.W. Forsburg S.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 7922-7932Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). A Dbf4-related protein, Drf1, involved in the progression of both S and M phases as well as in checkpoint responses, was isolated in human cells (39Yoshizawa-Sugata N. Ishii A. Taniyama C. Matsui E.

Chem. 2003; 278: 41083-41092Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). It has also been proposed that the Xenopus homolog of Dbf4 is required for heart development independently of its function in DNA replication (42Brott B.K. Sokol S.Y. Dev. Cell. 2005; 8: 703-715Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). No Cdc7 or Dbf4 paralogs have been described in budding yeast so far, making plausible a dual role for Dbf4 in meiosis. The phenotypes that we described for the loss of Dbf4 function (i.e. persistent cohesion and kinetochore bi-orientation) show a strong resemblance with cdc5/polo mutant phenotypes during meiosis (30Clyne R.K. Katis V.L. Jessop L. Benjamin K.R. Herskowitz I. Lichten M. Nasmyth K. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 480-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar, 31Lee B.H. Amon A. Science. 2003; 300: 482-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). We propose that Dbf4 might be necessary for Cdc5/Polo function. Polo-like kinases are characterized by the presence of two phospho-dependent substrate-targeting modules, the polo boxes, in their non-catalytic C-terminal domain (43Elia A.E. Rellos P. Haire L.F. Chao J.W. Ivins F.J. Hoepker K. Mohammad D. Cantley L.C. Smerdon S.J. Yaffe M.B. Cell. 2003; 115: 83-95Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (611) Google Scholar). Polo boxes recognize S-[pS/pT]-P/X motifs in pre-phosphorylated substrates, and by doing so, both unmask the catalytic domain and recruit the kinase to specific subcellular structures. Thus the biological activity of polo kinases is believed to rely on “priming kinases” that pre-phosphorylate their substrates. The Cdc7 kinase is known to preferentially phosphorylate S-S/T-P motifs. Because the meiotic phenotypes of depleting Cdc5 and Dbf4 are so similar, it is tempting to speculate that Cdc7-Dbf4 may act as the priming kinase for Cdc5 providing a link between DNA replication and chromosome segregation during meiosis.

Many dynamic processes in cells are critically dependent on the microtubule-based cytoskeleton. The number, direction, and polarity of the microtubules are regulated by an organelle known as the microtubule-organizing center (MTOC) 4The abbreviations used are: MTOC, microtubule-organizing center; CRC-C, 77-residueC-terminal fragment of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii centrin; CRC-N, 94-residue N-terminal fragment of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii centrin; hCen2, human centrin iso-form-2; CaM, calmodulin; TnC, troponin C; cdc31p, the yeast homologue of centrin; K19, 19-residue cdc31p-binding domain of Kar1; HSQC, heteronuclear single quantum coherence; NOE, nuclear Overhauser effect. 4The abbreviations used are: MTOC, microtubule-organizing center; CRC-C, 77-residueC-terminal fragment of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii centrin; CRC-N, 94-residue N-terminal fragment of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii centrin; hCen2, human centrin iso-form-2; CaM, calmodulin; TnC, troponin C; cdc31p, the yeast homologue of centrin; K19, 19-residue cdc31p-binding domain of Kar1; HSQC, heteronuclear single quantum coherence; NOE, nuclear Overhauser effect.. In higher eukaryotes, such as humans, the centrosome functions as the MTOC. Lower organisms possess equivalent MTOCs, notably the basal body in algae and the spindle pole body in yeast. The composition of MTOCs is highly proteinaceous, and there exists significant structural heterogeneity between them in different eukaryotes. Despite this heterogeneity, MTOCs in all eukaryotes contain a number of conserved protein components.One of these proteins is centrin (also known as caltractin), an EF-hand calcium-binding protein that has been identified in organisms ranging from protozoa and yeast to plants and humans (1Schiebel E. Bornens M. Trends Cell Biol. 1995; 5: 197-201Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 2Salisbury J.L. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 39-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). Genetic studies show that centrin is essential to proper cellular division because it regulates the cell cycle-dependent duplication and segregation of the MTOCs (3Baum P. Furlong C. Byers B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 5512-5516Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar, 4Taillon B.E. Adler S.A. Suhan J.P. Jarvik J.W. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 1613-1624Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Other centrin functions include: (i) initiation of flagellar excision in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii through a fiber-based microtubule severing mechanism (5Sanders M.A. Salisbury J.L. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 795-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar), (ii) forming part of the human heterotrimeric DNA damage recognition complex required for global genome nucleotide excision repair (6Araki M. Masutani C. Takemura M. Uchida A. Sugasawa K. Kondoh J. Ohkuma Y. Hanaoka F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 18665-18672Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar), (iii) modulation of homologous recombination and nucleotide excision repair in Arabidopsis (7Molinier J. Ramos C. Fritsch O. Hohn B. Plant Cell. 2004; 16: 1633-1643Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), and (iv) involvement with nuclear mRNA export machinery in yeast (8Fischer T. Rodriguez-Navarro S. Pereira G. Racz A. Schiebel E. Hurt E. Nat. Cell Biol. 2004; 6: 840-848Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar).Centrin is closely related to the ubiquitous archetypal EF-hand calcium sensor protein calmodulin (CaM). Both proteins are composed of two structurally independent globular domains connected by a flexible linker. Each structural domain contains two helix-loop-helix “EF-hand” calcium-binding motifs (9Linse S. Helmersson A. Forsen S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 8050-8054Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Unlike CaM, centrin has a long (∼20 residue) positively charged N-terminal extension that is highly disordered in solution. This region has been shown to mediate calcium-dependent polymerization of human centrin2 (hCen2) in vitro (10Tourbez M. Firanescu C. Yang A. Unipan L. Duchambon P. Blouquit Y. Craescu C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 47672-47680Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar).Calcium-induced conformational change is central to the target activation mechanism of CaM and other EF-hand calcium sensor proteins (11Hoeflich K.P. Ikura M. Cell. 2002; 108: 739-742Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (579) Google Scholar). The mechanism for activation of CaM-like calcium sensors involves calcium-induced structural rearrangements within each domain, which lead to the formation of large hydrophobic cavities on the molecular surface that mediate the interaction with target proteins. The interactions of CaM with kinase targets were the first to be characterized structurally and these studies revealed binding through a wrap-around mode where both domains envelop a single helical moiety from the target (12Ikura M. Clore G.M. Gronenborn A.M. Zhu G. Klee C.B. Bax A. Science. 1992; 256: 632-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (1176) Google Scholar). As additional CaM targets were characterized, other binding mechanisms were observed including extended and dimerization modes (reviewed in Ref. 13Bhattacharya S. Bunick C.G. Chazin W.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1742: 69-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). In the case of centrin, there is mounting evidence that the extended binding mode may be more prominent (14Spang A. Courtney I. Grein K. Matzner M. Schiebel E. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 863-877Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 15Ivanovska I. Rose M.D. Genetics. 2001; 157: 503-518Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Hu H. Chazin W.J. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 330: 473-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 17Hu H. Sheehan J.H. Chazin W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 50895-50903Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), and this subject remains an area of intense investigation.Centrin and CaM have strikingly different calcium binding properties when measured in vitro. CaM has four high affinity calcium-binding sites (designated sites I-IV) with dissociation constants (Kd) in the range of 1-10 μm under physiological salt concentrations (9Linse S. Helmersson A. Forsen S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 8050-8054Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The relatively high affinity of CaM for calcium enables it to respond effectively to physiologically relevant increases in the intracellular concentration of free calcium, which typically rises into the range of 1-10 μm. Most centrins, in contrast, have different calcium binding properties, including one or more non-functional calcium binding sites. Two examples emphasize these distinct centrin calcium binding characteristics. 1) The yeast homologue of centrin (cdc31p) has two defective calcium binding sites (sites II and III) based on both mutational studies and primary sequence analysis of the residues comprising the EF-hand loops (15Ivanovska I. Rose M.D. Genetics. 2001; 157: 503-518Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Geier B.M. Wiech H. Schiebel E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28366-28374Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). 2) The C-terminal domain of C. reinhardtii centrin (CRC-C) has substantially lower affinity for calcium in vitro than that observed for typical EF-hand calcium sensors because of the substitution of a highly conserved glutamate with an aspartate at position 12 in site III (16Hu H. Chazin W.J. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 330: 473-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 19Veeraraghavan S. Fagan P.A. Hu H. Lee V. Harper J.F. Huang B. Chazin W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 28564-28571Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). In canonical EF-hand loops, the glutamate at position 12 provides important bidentate oxygen coordination of calcium. Nevertheless, despite reduced calcium binding affinity in site IV, CRC-C is able to mediate the interaction with Kar1 and the other target proteins reported for centrin (20Kilmartin J.V. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 162: 1211-1221Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 21Biggins S. Rose M.D. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 843-852Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 22Sullivan D.S.

Chem. 2003; 278: 40252-40261Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) using the fully functional site IV.A number of centrin-binding partners have been identified, and the majority of those studied appear to bind primarily via the C-terminal domain. Recently, a peptide corresponding to the cdc31p-binding region of Kar1 (K19) was shown to bind with high affinity only to the C-terminal domain of C. reinhardtii centrin in vitro (17Hu H. Sheehan J.H. Chazin W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 50895-50903Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The calcium affinity in the presence of the target was sufficiently high to warrant the notion that CRC-C is bound to Kar1 at the basal level of calcium in the cell. This observation implies that the N-terminal domain serves as the centrin calcium sensor.Sfi1 is another known centrin-binding partner, which, like centrin, is an essential component of the yeast MTOC (20Kilmartin J.V. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 162: 1211-1221Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Yeast Sfi1 contains 17 repeats of a centrin binding motif containing the consensus sequence AX7LLX3F/LX2WK/R. It has been shown that the interaction of Sfi1 with centrin is essential for mitosis (20Kilmartin J.V. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 162: 1211-1221Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). A model has been proposed for calcium/centrin-dependent contraction of the Sfi1 filament (43Salisbury J. Curr. Biol. 2004; 14: R27-R29Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), in which it is conceivable that both centrin domains are involved.We report here the three-dimensional structure of CRC-N in the presence of calcium, determined by solution NMR spectroscopy. The domain occupies an open conformation similar to EF-hand calcium sensor domains. A comparative analysis of the structure reveals why CRC interacts with Kar1 only via its C-terminal domain and identifies structural features that distinguish CRC from CaM and other typical EF-hand calcium sensor proteins. To test the proposal that it serves as a calcium sensor, titrations of CRC-N with the seventh centrin-binding repeat of Sfi1 were performed, using intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence and NMR spectroscopy to characterize the interaction.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESRecombinant C. reinhardtii centrin N-terminal domain was expressed and purified as described elsewhere (19Veeraraghavan S.

Small aliquots of appropriate dilutions of a 1 mmCRC-N stock solution containing 150 mm KCl and 25 mm Tris at pH 7.1 were added to a 5 μm (initial concentration) Sfi1 peptide solution under identical conditions, then incubated with 1 mm EDTA or 5 mm Ca2+. Corrections for background fluorescence were made by subtracting the spectra from identical solutions without peptide.NMR Spectroscopy—NMR data were acquired on five different samples15 of CRC-N with the following isotopic compositions: unlabeled; U-15N; U-13C; U-15-N,13C; and 10% 13C. Buffers contained either 10% or 100%2 H2O as appropriate. Each sample typically had a protein concentration of 1-2 mm in a buffer of 25 mm Tris-d11 and 5-10 mm CaCl2 at pH 7.0.All NMR data were recorded at 25 °C on Bruker DRX600 and DRX800 spectrometers equipped with triple-resonance probe heads and triple axis pulsed field gradient accessories. Backbone sequential assignments of CRC-N were achieved by the combined use of HNCA, CBCANH, CBCA(CO)NH, and HNCO experiments (NMR experiments reviewed in Ref. 25Cavanagh J. Fairbrother W.J. Palmer III, A.G. Skelton N.J. Protein NMR Spectroscopy: Principles and Practice. Academic Press Inc., New York1996Google Scholar). Aliphatic side chain resonance assignments were obtained from(H)CC(CO)NH, H(CCCO)NH, and HBHA-(CO)NH experiments. 1H chemical shift assignments of aromatic side chains were primarily based on a two-dimensional homonuclear two-quantum experiment. Stereospecific assignments of the valine and leucine methyl groups were achieved using the 10% 13C-enriched sample (26Neri D. Szyperski T. Otting G. Senn H. Wuthrich K. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 7510-7516Crossref PubMed Scopus (563) Google Scholar). To obtain NOE-based distance restraints, a two-dimensional homonuclear NOESY experiment was recorded on the unlabeled sample, a three-dimensional 15N NOESY-HSQC on the 15N-enriched sample, and three-dimensional 13C NOESY-HSQC and four-dimensional13C HMQC-NOESY-HMQC on the uniformly 13C-labeled sample. The mixing time used in all NOESY experiments was 100 ms. Standard 15N-1H HSQC spectra were acquired under identical conditions for calcium-loaded U-15N CRC-N the absence and presence of a 3-fold excess of Sfi1 peptide. Data were processed in FELIX (Version 2000; Accelrys, San Diego, CA).Structure Calculations—NOE assignments were made using FELIX and aided by the program SANE (27Duggan B.M. Legge G.B. Dyson H.J. Wright P.E. J. Biomol. NMR. 2001; 19: 321-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Initial analysis of the NOE data indicated that the first 23 residues (Gly(-2) through Gly21) of the 96-residue CRC-N construct were highly disordered. Consequently, the first 20 residues (Gly (-2) through Gly18) were excluded from the structure calculations. For residues Leu22 through Met94, a total of 1108 NOE-based distance restraints (462 intraresidue, 220 sequential, 208 medium range, and 218 long range) were derived from the suite of NOESY experiments noted above. These restraints were initially assigned conservative upper bounds based on calibration of the NOESY cross-peak intensities against NOE correlations corresponding to known proton-proton distances or distance ranges. They were subsequently fine-tuned through a series of test structure calculations. The final restraint list had upper bounds of 3.5, 4.5, and 6.0 Å for the three-dimensional 15N NOESY-HSQC, three-dimensional 13C NOESY-HSQC, and four-dimensional 13C HMQC-NOESY-HMQC data sets, and 4.5 and 6.0 Å for the two-dimensional NOESY experiment. In addition, 24 distance restraints were generated for 12 hydrogen bonds based on the observation of reduced amide exchange rates and characteristic NOEs (28Akke M. Skelton N.J. Kordel J. Palmer III, A.G. Chazin W.J. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 9832-9844Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar), and 116 backbone torsion angle restraints, each with an assigned minimum range of ±30°, were obtained from 1Hα, 13Cα, 13Cβ, 13C′, and 15N chemical shifts using the program TALOS (29Cornilescu G. Delaglio F. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1999; 13: 289-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (2729) Google Scholar).Initial structures of CRC-N were generated using DYANA (30Guntert P. Mumenthaler C. Wuthrich K. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 273: 283-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (2545) Google Scholar) and subsequently refined with the program AMBER (31Pearlman D.A. Case D.A. Caldwell J.W. Ross W.S. Cheatham III, T.E. DeBolt S. Ferguson D. Seibel G. Kollman P. Comput. Phys. Commun. 1995; 91: 1-41Crossref Scopus (2628) Google Scholar) (Version 7.0) using a 20-ps simulated annealing protocol described previously (16Hu H. Chazin W.J. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 330: 473-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Out of the 50 structures generated, 45 converged properly to a single fold. The program FINDFAM (32Smith J.A. Gomez-Paloma L. Case D.A. Chazin W.J. Magn. Reson. Chem. 1996; 34S: 147-155Crossref Google Scholar) was then used to establish that at least 20 structures were needed to adequately represent the ensemble. The final representative ensemble of 20 structures was selected on the basis of minimal constraint violation energies. All of these structures also had favorable (low) molecular energies in the AMBER force field.Structure Analysis—Graphical analysis of the structures was carried out using the program MOLMOL (33Koradi R. Billeter M. Wuthrich K. J. Mol. Graph. 1996; 14 (51-55): 29-32Crossref Scopus (6469) Google Scholar). The stereochemistry of the final family of structures was assessed using the software PROCHECK NMR (34Laskowski R.A. Rullmannn J.A. MacArthur M.W. Kaptein R. Thornton J.M. J. Biomol. NMR. 1996; 8: 477-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (4329) Google Scholar). Inter-helical angles were calculated using the program INTERHLX (Kyoko Yap, University of Toronto). ClustalW (35Thompson J.D. Higgins D.G. Gibson T.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4673-4680Crossref PubMed Scopus (55203) Google Scholar) was used for multiple-sequence alignments. Homology models were constructed using the SWISS-MODEL module at ExPASy (36Schwede T. Kopp J. Guex N. Peitsch M.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 3381-3385Crossref PubMed Scopus (4424) Google Scholar). Structures used in the comparative analyses2+ were obtained from the Protein Data Bank: apo CaM(1CFC), Ca2+-CaM (1CLL), Ca2+-CaM/R20 complex (1CDL), Ca2+-TnC (1TN4), and Ca2+-S100B (1MHO).Data Deposition—The 1H, 13C, and 15N chemical shift assignments have been deposited with the BioMagResBank under accession number 6918. The coordinates of the final family of 20 structures and the full list of NMR restraints used in the structure calculations have been deposited with the Protein Data Bank under accession code 2AMI.RESULTSThe high resolution three-dimensional structure of calcium-loaded CRC-N was determined by multidimensional heteronuclear NMR spectroscopy. The favorable line widths and excellent dispersion exhibited in the NMR spectra greatly facilitated the chemical shift assignments and NOE analysis. Nearly complete 1H, 13C, and 15N resonance assignments were obtained for CRC-N. A total of 1248 (>16/residue) experimentally derived NMR restraints (1108 NOE-based distance restraints, 24 hydrogen bond distance restraints, 116 backbone torsion angle restraints) were used in the structure calculations. The final representative ensemble of structures exhibits low constraint violation energies, with no distance violations >0.2 Å and no torsion angle violations >5°, and low molecular energies (-1072 ± 26 kcal-mol-1)in the AMBER force field. Analysis by PROCHECK NMR shows that 91.5% of all backbone torsion angles, excluding proline and glycine residues, fall within the most favored regions of the Ramachandran plot. The structural statistics for the final ensemble are summarized in Table 1.TABLE 1Statistics for the (Ca2+)2-CRC-N structural ensembleA.

Open table in a new tab A stereo view of the family of 20 conformers that represent the structure of (Ca2+)2-CRC-N is shown in Fig. 1. The secondary structure elements of CRC-N are defined to a high level of precision, whereas the two calcium-binding loops, the linker connecting the two EF-hands, and the two termini are less well defined (Table 1). Not surprisingly, the overall fold of CRC-N is very similar to other EF-hand proteins, with the two EF-hands packed against each other to form a single structural domain. This compact packing of the pair of EF-hands into a four-helix bundle is important for function (37Nelson M.R. Thulin E. Fagan P.A. Forsen S. Chazin W.J. Protein Sci. 2002; 11: 198-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar).One important means to classify EF-hand calcium binding proteins is via their inter-helical angles. To this end, inter-helical angles were calculated for calcium-loaded CRC-N and compared with CRC-C and the representative calcium sensors: CaM, TnC, and S100B (Table 2). The comparison of inter-helical angles shows that CRC-N occupies an open conformation more similar to CRC-C and the individual domains of calcium-bound CaM than those of apo-CaM and the alternate “S100-type” calcium sensor. This analysis confirms that CRC-N adopts an open conformation in the calcium-loaded state, consistent with calcium sensor activity.TABLE 2Comparison of inter-helical angles in CRC-N, CaM, TnC, and S100BaThe standard deviations in the inter-helical angles for the three NMR structure ensembles (2AMI, 1OQP, 1CFC) are all less than 8°.

https://openalex.org/W2060993096,"Group A streptococci (GAS) display receptors for the human zymogen plasminogen on the cell surface, one of which is the plasminogen-binding group A streptococcal M protein (PAM). Characterization of PAM genes from 12 GAS isolates showed significant variation within the plasminogen-binding repeat motifs (a1/a2) of this protein. To determine the impact of sequence variation on protein function, recombinant proteins representing five naturally occurring variants of PAM, together with a recombinant M1 protein, were expressed and purified. Equilibrium dissociation constants for the interaction of PAM variants with biotinylated Glu-plasminogen ranged from 1.58 to 4.99 nm. Effective concentrations of prototype PAM required for 50% inhibition of plasminogen binding to immobilized PAM variants ranged from 0.68 to 22.06 nm. These results suggest that although variation in the a1/a2 region of the PAM protein does affect the comparative affinity of PAM variants, the functional capacity to bind plasminogen is conserved. Additionally, a potential role for the a1 region of PAM in eliciting a protective immune response was investigated by using a mouse model for GAS infection. The a1 region of PAM was found to protect immunized mice challenged with a PAM-positive GAS strain. These data suggest a link between selective immune pressure against the plasminogen-binding repeats and the functional conservation of the binding domain in PAM variants."

Unlike the enzyme from microorganisms, plant TS is activated by S-adenosylmethionine (AdoMet). The mechanism of activation has remained unknown up to now. We report here the crystallographic structures of Arabidopsis thaliana TS in complex with PLP (aTS) and with PLP and AdoMet (aTS-AdoMet), which show with atomic detail how AdoMet activates TS. The aTS structure reveals a PLP orientation never previously observed for a type II PLP-dependent enzyme and explains the low activity of plant TS in the absence of its allosteric activator. The aTS-AdoMet structure shows that activation of the enzyme upon AdoMet binding triggers a large reorganization of active site loops in one monomer of the structural dimer and allows the displacement of PLP to its active conformation. Comparison with other TS structures shows that activation of the second monomer may be triggered by substrate binding. This structure also discloses a novel fold for two AdoMet binding sites located at the dimer interface, each site containing two AdoMet effectors bound in tandem.

Biochem. 2003; 270: 4615-4627Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), plant TS, which has a low basal activity rate, has acquired an allosteric activation by S-adenosylmethionine (AdoMet), the end product of the methionine pathway. Indeed, previous biochemical results showed that allosteric binding of AdoMet leads to an 8-fold increase in the rate of catalysis and to a 25-fold decrease in the Km value for OPH in the Arabidopsis thaliana enzyme (2Curien G. Job D. Douce R. Dumas R. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 13212-13221Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). This activation is correlated with conformational modifications of the PLP environment as demonstrated by fluorescence experiments (2Curien G. Job D. Douce R. Dumas R. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 13212-13221Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The structure of the apoform of A. thaliana TS (called apo-aTS hereafter) has been solved previously at 2.25 Å resolution (3Thomazeau K. Curien G. Dumas R. Biou V. Protein Sci. 2001; 10: 638-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). A. thaliana threonine synthase is a dimer with 486 amino acids/monomer. The structure of the apoenzyme shows a symmetric, compact dimer with four domains in each monomer: domain 1 (residues 1-130), domain 2 (residues 161-270), domain 3 (residues 131-160 and 271-460), and the C-terminal swap domain, thus called because it forms a structural domain with domain 2 of the other monomer (residues 461-486). The active site is located in a deep crevice at the interface of domains 2 and 3 of each monomer. PLP-dependent enzymes catalyze a large variety of reactions, mostly on amino acid substrates. TS belongs to the family of fold-type II PLP-dependent enzymes (4Schneider G. Käck H.Y.L. Structure (Camb.). 2000; 8: R1-R6Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). Comparison of the plant enzyme structure with the structures of the non-allosteric TS from Thermus thermophilus (5Omi R. Goto M. Miyahara I. Mizuguchi H. Hayashi H. Kagamiyama H. Hirotsu K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 46035-46045Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), Saccharomyces cerevisiae (6Garrido-Franco M. Ehlert S. Messerschmidt A. Marinkovic S. Huber R.

Gilliland G.L. Xiao G. Zondlo J. Fisher K.E. Chinchilla D. Eisenstein E. Structure (Camb.). 1998; 6: 465-475Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar), O-acetylserine sulfhydrylase (8Burkhard P. Rao G.S. Hohenester E. Schnackerz K.D. Cook P.F. Jansonius J.N. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 283: 121-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar), or tryptophan synthase (9Hyde C.C. Ahmed S.A. Padlan E.A. Miles E.W. Davies D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 17857-17871Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)) showed that all of these proteins share a common fold for domains 2 and 3, whereas domain 1 and the swap domain are specific to TS. However, the structure of the plant apo-aTS revealed an absence of electron density for PLP in the active site. In addition, several amino acids that interact with the PLP in enzymes belonging to the fold-type II family exhibit different orientations in the apo-aTS structure. Furthermore, a large loop that tops the active site and is ordered in all structures of fold-type II enzymes is disordered in the plant TS structure between residues 341 and 362. From these observations, the following three hypotheses were made. First, the apo-aTS structure previously determined might correspond to an inactive form that can only bind its PLP in a conformation unfavorable for catalysis. Second, the activator AdoMet should lead to a change in the PLP orientation to one similar to that observed in the fold-type II enzymes. Third, the above conformational modifications should promote the enzyme activation. To check these hypotheses, we have determined the crystallographic structures of the A. thaliana TS in the presence of PLP and with PLP and AdoMet. Along with the structure of holoenzyme TS-PLP (called aTS hereafter), we present here the first structure of a complex between an enzyme and AdoMet as an allosteric activator (hereafter called aTS-AdoMet). Purification and Crystallization—A. thaliana aTS was purified as described previously (10Curien G. Dumas R. Ravanel S. Douce R. FEBS Lett. 1996; 390: 85-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The purified protein was concentrated to 18 mg/ml in 20 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.5. To collect the aTS data set, TS was crystallized as described in Ref. 3Thomazeau K. Curien G. Dumas R. Biou V. Protein Sci. 2001; 10: 638-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, with reservoirs containing 1 m LiCl, 13% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 6000, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 m MES-KOH buffer at pH 6.5 and 6 mm PLP. 2 μl of protein at 10 mg/ml were mixed with 2 μl of reservoir solution. The crystals grew for 3 weeks before they reached a size of ∼500 μm. They were transferred into a solution containing 1 m LiCl, 20% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 6000, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 m MES-KOH, 10 mg/ml protein, and 6 mm PLP and incubated for 3 h before being transferred to a cryobuffer containing 10% glycerol, 1 m LiCl, 20% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 6000, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 6 mm PLP, and 0.1 m MES-KOH, pH 6.5. The crystals were flash-frozen in the cryostream. The crystals belong to the P1 space group, with unit cell dimensions of a = 57.57, b = 60.94, and c = 76.63 Å; α = 108.92°, β = 102.07°, γ = 107.30°. These crystals cracked upon soaking in a solution containing AdoMet. For aTS-AdoMet, new crystallization conditions were found using robotized screening. aTS-AdoMet was crystallized by the hanging drop vapor method at 4 °C, with reservoirs containing 10 mm CaCl2, 15% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 2000 monomethyl ether, 1 mm PLP, and 100 mm BisTris, pH 6.5, buffer. aTS (8 mg/ml) was incubated with 5 mm AdoMet, and then crystallization drops were set up by mixing 2 μl of protein/AdoMet and 2 μl of reservoir solution. Crystals grew within 3-5 days and were shock-cooled in liquid N2 in a cold room using a reservoir solution supplemented with 10% ethylene glycol a first time and 20% ethylene glycol a second time. This “progressive” method improved the diffraction. The crystals were monoclinic with a C2 symmetry. The unit cell was a = 191.9Å, b = 110.8Å, c = 152.7Å, α = γ = 90°, β = 89.8° with three dimers A-B, C-D, and E-F in the asymmetric unit and with pseudo-P3121 symmetry. Data Collection, Structure Determination, and Refinement—Data collection for aTS was performed on a lab source using a Marresearch imaging plate detector. Data were processed using XDS (11Kabsch W. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 795-800Crossref Scopus (3200) Google Scholar) and scaled using the SCALA program (12Evans P.R. Recent Advances in Phasing. Daresbury Laboratory, Warrington, UK1997: 97-102Google Scholar). X-ray data for aTS-AdoMet were collected at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility on beamline ID14 EH1 to 2.6 Å resolution using a Marresearch CCD detector. Data were processed and scaled using the programs MOSFLM (13Leslie A.G.W. Joint CCP4 and ESF-EAMCB Newsletter on Protein Crystallography. 1992; 26Google Scholar) and SCALA (12Evans P.R. Recent Advances in Phasing. Daresbury Laboratory, Warrington, UK1997: 97-102Google Scholar). The two structures were phased by molecular replacement with program MOLREP (14Vagin A. Teplyakov A. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1997; 30: 1022-1025Crossref Scopus (4098) Google Scholar) using the coordinates of apo-aTS (Protein Data Bank code 1E5X). For both structures, the refinement was performed using CNS, version 1.1 (15Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16919) Google Scholar) and the maximum likelihood target function. During the whole process, 5% of the reflections were kept apart for the Rfree calculation. Model modifications were performed with program O (16Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (12999) Google Scholar). The refinement of aTS was straightforward. The refinement of aTS-AdoMet was done as follows. After molecular replacement, the first steps of crystallographic refinement for aTS-AdoMet consisted of a rigid body refinement at a resolution of 3 Å, with one rigid block per monomer. The R-factor was 41.4%, and the Rfree was 41.8%. A simulated annealing refinement followed at a resolution of 2.6 Å. Harmonic non-crystallographic symmetry restraints were used with two non-crystallographic symmetry groups, each with three monomers (monomers A, C, and E in the first group and monomers B, D, and F in the second). An Fo - Fc map displayed six large density peaks per dimer, which were assigned to the co-factor PLP (one in each active site) and to four AdoMet molecules (at the dimer interface). A large loop, which was not ordered in the unligated TS structure, was built in monomers A, C, and E. Thereafter, atomic positions and grouped temperature factors were refined during several cycles to reach an R-factor of 30% and an Rfree of 35%. For the following refinement steps, individual temperature factors were introduced and an anisotropic global temperature factor and bulk solvent corrections were used. Water molecules were added at each cycle of refinement, using the WATERPICK routine in CNS. Final refinement was performed with Refmac5 (17Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1997; 53: 240-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (13712) Google Scholar) and TLS option using three regions per monomer for TLS calculations (18Winn M.D. Isupov M.N. Murshudov G.N. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 2001; 57: 122-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (1639) Google Scholar). Structure Comparisons—For structure comparisons, unless otherwise stated, residues 36-479 from both monomers were used to calculate the best superposition using the programs LSQKAB (19Kabsch W. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1976; 32: 922-923Crossref Scopus (2274) Google Scholar) or LSQ-MAN (20Kleywegt G.J. Alwyn Jones T. Carter Jr., C.W. Sweet R.M. Methods in Enzynology. Academic Press, 1997: 525-545Google Scholar) and superpose aTS-AdoMet and aTS dimers. The distances cited in the text correspond to the Cα-Cα distances based on this superposition. The model coordinates and structure factors were deposited at the Protein Data Bank under codes 2C2G (aTS) and 2C2B (aTS-AdoMet). Overall Structure of aTS Complex—The final model of the aTS complex contains one dimer (852 amino acid residues), two PLP molecules, and 138 water molecules and was refined to an R-factor of 18.5% at 2.6 Å resolution (Table 1). The overall structure is quite similar to that of apoTS; the r.m.s. deviation between the Cα atoms is 0.55 Å. Dimer subunits are related by a non-crystallographic 2-fold axis. The Cα atoms of the two subunits were superposed with an r.m.s. deviation of 0.48 Å and similar temperature factors, indicating that the two monomers have essentially the same structure. The model is of good quality with all of the residues falling in the most favorable (85.1%), additionally allowed (14.7%), and generously allowed (0.1%) regions of the Ramachandran plot, as assessed by the PROCHECK program (21Laskowski R. MacArthur M. Moss D. Thornton J. J. Appl.

Open table in a new tab The surface area of the dimer interface is 7448 Å2, which amounts to ∼19% of each subunit surface area. The electron density map of aTS discloses density for amino acid residues 65-68, which were missing from the apo-aTS structure. The last amino acid residue exhibiting density is Gly-480. Similarly to apo-aTS, the N terminus residues are only partly ordered; residues 11-21 and 29 onward in monomer A and residues 21-25 and 32 onward in monomer B could be traced. The Fo - Fc electron density map shows, inside the active site of each monomer, a PLP co-factor bound to Lys-163 via a Schiff base. The active site conformation of aTS is different compared with those observed in the structure of non-allosteric TS from T. thermophilus (5Omi R. Goto M. Miyahara I. Mizuguchi H. Hayashi H. Kagamiyama H. Hirotsu K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 46035-46045Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) or S. cerevisiae (6Garrido-Franco M. Ehlert S. Messerschmidt A. Marinkovic S. Huber R. Laber B. Bourenkov G.P. Clausen T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 12396-12405Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). In addition, the PLP orientation inside the aTS catalytic site is completely different compared with all other known enzyme structures belonging to the fold-type II PLP-dependent family. Also, loop 341-362 involved in the stabilization of PLP in TS from microorganisms is disordered in the aTS, as previously observed for the structure of apo-aTS. Overall Structure of aTS-AdoMet Complex—The final model of the aTS-AdoMet complex contains six monomers that clearly correspond to three functional dimers, with an interface involving the same residues as in apo-aTS. The model comprises 2598 amino acid residues, 6 PLPs, 12 AdoMets, and 383 water molecules in the asymmetric unit and was refined to an R-factor of 20.6% at 2.6 Å resolution (Table 1). The main chain atoms of the three dimers were superposed with an r.m.s. deviation of 0.15 Å, indicating that the three dimers have the same structure. The model of aTS-AdoMet is also of good quality, with all of the residues falling in the most favorable (87.2%), additionally allowed (12.3%), and generously allowed (0.4%) regions of the Ramachandran plot. Only two residues per dimer are in the disallowed region. These residues (47 and 48 in monomer A) are located in a tight loop and show a well defined density. The structure of aTS co-crystallized with PLP and its allosteric effector AdoMet revealed the presence of four AdoMet molecules located at the dimer interface (Fig. 1). The surface area of the dimer interface is 7006 Å2, which amounts to ∼18% of the subunit surface area. This value is similar to the one determined for aTS, indicating that AdoMet binding does not make a significant change to the surface involved in the dimer interface. However, superposition of the Cα atoms of the aTS-AdoMet and the aTS dimers give an overall r.m.s. deviation of 1.54 Å and a maximum deviation of 5.6 Å, indicating that important changes do occur upon AdoMet binding. Interestingly, the Cα atoms of monomers A and B of aTS-AdoMet were superposed with the corresponding monomers of aTS, with an r.m.s. deviation of 1.51 and 0.92 Å, respectively, showing that the dimer of the aTS-AdoMet is asymmetric and that monomer B is more similar to aTS than to monomer A. Therefore, AdoMet induces different conformational changes to monomers A and B. These important modifications upon AdoMet binding led to the reorganization of only one active site. Thus, aTS-AdoMet structure consists of an asymmetric dimer in which one PLP in monomer B has an orientation similar to that found in the aTS structure, whereas the one in monomer A has an orientation similar to that found in the crystal structure of TS from microorganisms and all other related structures. This difference is observed in all three dimers in the asymmetric unit, and the rest of the discussion will focus on the A-B dimer only. PLP Binding Site of aTS—PLP binding does not alter the main chain atoms of residues involved in the catalytic pocket in aTS as compared with apo-aTS. However, upon PLP binding, the side chain of Asn-296 moves away from the co-factor by 2.9 Å. Fig. 2A shows PLP interactions inside the catalytic pocket. The phosphate group of PLP interacts with Ser-191 and Thr-195 via two hydrogen bonds. The pyridine ring is sandwiched between Arg-267 and Asn-296. In addition, it is surrounded on the N1 side by Ser-261 and on the O3′-side by residues Lys-163 (with which it forms a Schiff base), Gln-271, and Asn-299. Both hydrophobic and polar contacts are formed. Residues that interact with the PLP in this new manner are not specific to plant sequences, but they are shared by other TS sequences, as well as by other fold-type II enzymes (see sequence alignment in supplemental Fig. 1). However, the orientation of the residues and position of PLP in the aTS structure is unique for an enzyme of the fold-type II PLP-dependent family. The Two PLP Binding Sites of aTS-AdoMet—Upon AdoMet binding, monomer A undergoes a large active site rearrangement, whereas the active site and PLP orientation of monomer B remains unchanged. The reorganization in monomer A consists of a PLP swing and a shift of loops 190-195, 260-264, and 294-299, with a maximum displacement of Thr-192 and Asn-296 by 2.53 and 3.05 Å, respectively (Fig. 2, compare A and B). In addition, the electron density becomes well defined for the large loop 341-362, which is stabilized and interacts with residues of the catalytic pocket. However, the PLP does not form any electrostatic interaction with residues from this loop (the closest residue is Ala-356, whose Cβ atom is 3.5 Å away from the PLP pyridine ring). The movement of the PLP involves a 150° rotation around the C5-C5A bond, leading to a conformation similar to that observed in the TS structures from microorganisms. As described in Fig. 2B and supplemental Fig. 2, most of the residues involved in the interaction of PLP in its new position for monomer A of aTS-AdoMet were also involved in the binding of PLP in aTS. However, the interaction pattern with these residues is completely reorganized. As observed for other fold-type II enzymes, the phosphate group makes four hydrogen bonds with the main chain nitrogens of the semicircular loop 295-299. In addition, Arg-267 and Gln-271 interact with the phosphate group via a water molecule. The pyridine ring is surrounded by loop 191-195 on the O3′-side and by residues 431-433 on the N1 side. Thus, Asp-194 and Thr-432 make hydrogen bonds with O3′ and N1, respectively. In addition, the pyridine ring is surrounded by Phe-162 and Ala-356. AdoMet Binding Sites—Fig. 3 shows details of the AdoMet binding sites. The crystal structure of aTS-AdoMet contains two activator binding sites (1 and 2) located at the dimer interface with two AdoMet molecules in each site. As shown in Fig. 1, we have called site 1 the one that holds AdoMet 1 and 2, whereas site 2 holds AdoMet 3 and 4 (Fig. 3A). AdoMet 1 and 3 are most deeply buried in the dimer interface, whereas AdoMet 2 and 4 are more exposed to the solvent (Fig. 1). Moreover, all atoms from AdoMet 1 show a well defined electron density, whereas a gap can be observed between the sulfonium and the adjacent carbon of the methionine moiety of AdoMet 2, 3, and 4 (Fig. 3C). In each binding site, the two AdoMet molecules are in close proximity to each other and have two different conformations, whereas a superposition of sites 1 and 2 shows that both corresponding AdoMets have similar conformations. Each AdoMet is stabilized by amino acids from both monomers. One side of each AdoMet binding site is made of loop 96-106 and region 120-130 belonging to domain 1 from one monomer, whereas the other side is formed by region 131-154 belonging to domain 3 from the other monomer. Thus AdoMet 1 and 2 make interactions with domain 1 of monomer A and with domain 3 of monomer B. Symmetrically, AdoMet 3 and 4 are stabilized by domain 1 of monomer B and domain 3 of monomer A (Fig. 3A). The main stabilizing interactions for AdoMet 1 and AdoMet 3 are hydrogen bonds formed by the adenosine and the ribose with residues from both monomers, whereas their methionine moiety is in close proximity to the Trp-150 side chain and to AdoMet 2 and AdoMet 4 ribose, respectively (the main chain moiety of AdoMet 1 is within 3.5 Å of distance from the AdoMet 2 ribose oxygen) (Fig. 3, B and D). AdoMet 2 and AdoMet 4 are mainly stabilized via interactions of their adenosine ring with two tryptophan side chains (Fig. 3, B and D). Trp-101 is stacked against the adenine ring, whereas Trp-150 is perpendicular to it, the closest atoms being 3.6 Å apart. Sites 1 and 2 present very similar interactions with AdoMet molecules. However, although AdoMet 2 and 4 have equivalent positions, their interactions with the protein are not identical. In particular, the AdoMet 2 methionine carboxyl makes an electrostatic interaction with Lys-141 and Asn-147 of monomer B (Fig. 3D), whereas the AdoMet 4 methionine moiety interacts only with Lys-141 of monomer A. AdoMet Induces Asymmetric Conformational Changes—Fig. 3A shows that AdoMet binding induces a sliding of both monomers along the dimer interface. In particular, loops 96-106 of both monomers come closer to each other. A global movement, corresponding to a rotation of domain 2 toward and of domain 3 away from the interface is a consequence of this interface sliding (see Fig. 5). Fig. 4 shows the displacements of the Cα atoms between aTS-AdoMet and aTS, as calculated by LSQKAB (19Kabsch W. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1976; 32: 922-923Crossref Scopus (2274) Google Scholar) for both monomers. As shown on this figure, AdoMet binding induces important asymmetric conformational modifications (illustrated by peaks in Fig. 4). Monomer A presents three main peaks for domain 2 and three main peaks for domain 3, whereas monomer B shows only one large peak located at the swap domain, which forms a structural unit with domain 2 of monomer A (Fig. 4). As shown on Figs. 5 and 6, these modifications consist of two large, asymmetric changes. The first one corresponds to the rotation of a β-sheet formed by strands β6, β7 of monomer A domain 2, and β13 of monomer B swap domain. This sheet, along with the associated loops (216-219 and 237-240) and helices α11 and α21, rotate by an angle of 16° around an axis passing through residues A210, A233, and B460 (Fig. 6A). The second asymmetric change is the stabilization of the large loop 341-362 in monomer A above the active site (Fig. 5). All movements described above contribute to a reorganization of the active site of monomer A only (see the animation in supplemental Fig. 3). As a consequence of AdoMet binding, the accessible surface area calculated using the program AREAIMOL (22Lee B. Richards F.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1971; 55: 379-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (5293) Google Scholar) of the active site of monomer A is reduced from 890 Å2 (aTS) to 514 Å2 for (aTS-AdoMet). The closure of the active site cleft induced by AdoMet is obvious on supplemental Fig. 4, which shows the comparison between the surface of monomers in aTS and aTS-AdoMet. The structure of aTS discloses a PLP bound in an inactive conformation. The structure of aTS-AdoMet shows that AdoMet binding triggers the rotation of one PLP to its active conformation along with the reorganization of the active site. The following discussion will focus on how TS is able to perform this task via plant-specific active site conformational changes and the AdoMet binding site. Active Site Comparison between A. thaliana and Other Threonine Synthases—T. thermophilus (tTS, Protein Data Bank code 1UIN (5Omi R. Goto M. Miyahara I. Mizuguchi H. Hayashi H. Kagamiyama H. Hirotsu K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 46035-46045Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar)) and S. cerevisiae (sTS, Protein Data Bank code 1KL7 (6Garrido-Franco M. Ehlert S.

Ahmed S.A. Padlan E.A. Miles E.W. Davies D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 17857-17871Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, the conformations of the active site residues of the plant apo-aTS or aTS are different from those structures. As a result, the cofactor in the structure of aTS cannot bind in the same orientation. In particular, in aTS, the position of loop 294-298 prevents the PLP phosphate group from binding in an orientation similar to that of other PLP enzymes. The comparison between aTS and tTS complexed with a substrate analogue, 2-amino-5-phosphopentanoic acid (AP5) (tTS-AP5, Protein Data Bank code 1V7C (5Omi R. Goto M. Miyahara I. Mizuguchi H.

In particular, the pyridine cycle of the PLP takes the place of the substrate phosphate. This unu"
https://openalex.org/W2006807693,"Abstract Sumoylation regulates the activities of several members of the ETS transcription factor family. To provide a molecular framework for understanding this regulation, we have characterized the conjugation of Ets-1 with SUMO-1. Ets-1 is modified in vivo predominantly at a consensus sumoylation motif containing Lys-15. This lysine is located within the unstructured N-terminal segment of Ets-1 preceding its PNT domain. Using NMR spectroscopy, we demonstrate that the Ets-1 sumoylation motif associates with the substrate binding site on the SUMO-conjugating enzyme UBC9 (Kd ∼400 μm) and that the PNT domain is not involved in this interaction. Ets-1 with Lys-15 mutated to an arginine still binds UBC9 with an affinity similar to the wild type protein, but is no longer sumoylated. NMR chemical shift and relaxation measurements reveal that the covalent attachment of mature SUMO-1, via its flexible C-terminal Gly-97, to Lys-15 of Ets-1 does not perturb the structure or dynamic properties of either protein. Therefore sumoylated Ets-1 behaves as “beads-on-a-string” with the two proteins tethered by flexible polypeptide segments containing the isopeptide linkage. Accordingly, SUMO-1 may mediate interactions of Ets-1 with signaling or transcriptional regulatory macromolecules by acting as a structurally independent docking module, rather than through the induction of a conformational change in either protein upon their covalent linkage. We also hypothesize that the flexibility of the linking polypeptide sequence may be a general feature contributing to the recognition of SUMO-modified proteins by their downstream effectors."
https://openalex.org/W2112731369,"Hereditary tyrosinemia type I (HTI) is the most severe disease of the tyrosine degradation pathway. HTI is caused by a deficiency of fumarylacetoacetate hydrolase (FAH), the enzyme responsible for the hydrolysis of fumarylacetoacetate (FAA). As a result, there is an accumulation of metabolites such as maleylacetoacetate, succinylacetone, and FAA. The latter was shown to display mutagenic, cytostatic, and apoptogenic activities and to cause chromosomal instability. Herein, we demonstrate that FAA also causes a cellular insult leading to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress signaling. Treatment of V79 Chinese hamster lung cells with an apoptogenic dose of FAA (100 μm) causes an early induction of the ER resident chaperone GRP78/BiP and a simultaneous phosphorylation of the eIF2α. FAA treatment also causes a subsequent induction of the proapoptotic CHOP (CEBP homologous protein) transcription factor as well as a late activation of caspase-12. Data obtained from fah–/– mice taken off the therapeutic 2-(2-nitro-4-trifluoromethylbenzoyl)-1,3 cyclohexanedione drug are similar. However, in this mouse model, there is also an increase in proteasome activity indicative of ER-associated degradation. This difference observed between the two models may be due to the fact that the murine model measures the effects of all metabolites accumulating in hereditary tyrosinemia type I as opposed to the cellular model that only measures the effects of exogenous FAA.

The disease is caused by a deficiency of the last enzyme involved in the metabolic breakdown of tyrosine, fumarylacetoacetate hydrolase (FAH) (1Berger R. Van Faassen H. Taanman J.W. De Vries H.

As a result, there is an accumulation of metabolites upstream of FAH, such as succinylacetone, maleylacetoacetate, and fumarylacetoacetate (FAA). Although the molecular basis of the disease has been extensively studied, much remains to be learned concerning the cellular events underlying the pathology of the disease (progressive liver damage, liver failure, cirrhosis, hepatocarcinoma, tubular renal dysfunction, and porphyria-like crisis). Several studies have shown that FAA is cytotoxic to cells. FAA is also shown to be mutagenic and to cause chromosomal instability as well as lead to cell cycle arrest and apoptosis (6Jorquera R. Tanguay R.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 232: 42-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 7Jorquera R. Tanguay R.M.

Jorquera R. Poudrier J. St-Louis M. Acta Biochim. Pol. 1996; 43: 209-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Jorquera and Tanguay (8Jorquera R. Tanguay R.M. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2001; 10: 1741-1752Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) recently observed a disruption of the Golgi apparatus following the treatment of mammalian cells with FAA. An increase in intracellular calcium levels of 60% was observed in HeLa human cells and a 25% increase was observed in V79 Chinese hamster lung cells treated with exogenous FAA (8Jorquera R. Tanguay R.M. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2001; 10: 1741-1752Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Because cellular calcium homeostasis is tightly regulated by the endoplasmic reticulum and this cellular compartment is closely related to another organelle of the secretory pathway, the Golgi apparatus, we decided to investigate the possibility that FAA also causes a deleterious effect on the endoplasmic reticulum function. The ER is involved in many essential cellular functions such as protein folding, modification, and assembly, as well as lipids and sterols synthesis. The ER is also a major signal-transducing organelle sensitive to changes in cell homeostasis (e.g. calcium levels) and cellular stresses, which include glucose deprivation, mutations in the genes of secreted proteins, viral infection, heme deficiency, and oxidative stress (reviewed in Ref.10Rutkowski D.T. Kaufman R.J. Trends Cell Biol. 2004; 14: 20-28Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1177) Google Scholar). The ER stress can also be induced by the cytotoxic agents that disrupt protein folding or calcium homeostasis. In response to the ER stress and protein misfolding, cells activate a signal-transducing pathway known as the unfolded protein response (UPR) in an effort to deal with the protein load in the organelle (reviewed in Ref. 11Zhang K. Kaufman R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 25935-25938Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar). This response is mediated by kinases IRE1 and PERK, and by the activating transcription factor 6, all of which are regulated by the ER resident GRP78/BiP chaperone levels. The ER stress leads to an induction of these transducers that will result in the translational attenuation through eIF2α phosphorylation by PERK kinase (12Harding H.P. Novoa I. Zhang Y. Zeng H. Wek R. Schapira M. Ron D. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 1099-1108Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2384) Google Scholar), transcriptional activation of protein chaperones and folding catalyst genes (13Lee A.H. Iwakoshi N.N. Glimcher L.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 7448-7459Crossref PubMed Scopus (1594) Google Scholar), and the ER-associated degradation (ERAD) of misfolded proteins by the proteasome (14Friedlander R. Jarosch E. Urban J. Volkwein C. Sommer T. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 379-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar). Sustained ER stress may cause cells to undergo apoptosis. An ER-specific caspase activated by prolonged ER stress is caspase-12. This caspase may be activated by two different means. First, Ca2+ release from the ER to the cytosol may activate calpain protease in the cytosol, which may cleave the procaspase-12 zymogen to produce its active form (15Nakagawa T. Yuan J. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 887-894Crossref PubMed Scopus (1032) Google Scholar). Activated caspase-12, in return, initiates a caspase cascade leading to caspase-3 activation (16Morishima N. Nakanishi K. Takenouchi H. Shibata T. Yasuhiko Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 34287-34294Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (797) Google Scholar, 17Rao R.V. Castro-Obregon S. Frankowski H. Schuler M.

Another means by which procaspase-12 may be activated is through the sequestration of tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 2 by IRE1 enabling the clustering of the procaspase (18Yoneda T. Imaizumi K. Oono K. Yui D. Gomi F. Katayama T. Tohyama M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 13935-13940Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (687) Google Scholar). Procaspase-12 may then be cleaved by caspase-7 (19Rao R.V. Hermel E. Castro-Obregon S. del Rio G. Ellerby L.M. Bredesen D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33869-33874Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (545) Google Scholar). It is noteworthy that the ER stress may trigger both the extrinsic and intrinsic pathways of apoptosis. In fact, Ca2+ released from the ER may be taken up by the mitochondria (20Filippin L. Magalhães P.J. Di Benedetto G. Colella M. Pozzan T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 39224-39234Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar), where it can cause loss of the membrane potential of the organelle. Herein, we show that exogenous FAA or conditions leading to the HTI phenotype in vivo cause a cellular insult that elicits the ER stress response as demonstrated by an early induction of GRP78/BiP and eIF2α phosphorylation, an increase in proteasome activity, and late activations of CHOP and caspase-12. We also show increased levels of stress-related proteins, heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), Hsp27, and Hsp70, in vitro and in a murine model of HTI. Cell Culture and Treatments—Chinese hamster V79 lung cells (from the American Type Culture Collection) were grown in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum (Medicorp) at 37 °C with 5% CO2. Cells were plated at a density of 2.5 × 104 cells/ml in 15-cm flasks the day before treatment or at 1 × 105 cells/ml in 35-mm culture dishes the day before transfection (luciferase assay). FAA, an accumulating metabolite in HTI, was synthesized as described by Edwards and Knox (21Edwards S.W. Knox W.E. Methods in Enzymology II.5th Ed. Academic Press, New York1955: 292-309Google Scholar) from a porcine homogentisate dioxygenase extract using homogentisic acid (Sigma) as a precursor substrate for the reaction. Cells were treated with FAA (100 or 200 μm) in Hanks’ balanced salt solution (HBSS, Invitrogen) for 2 h and then left to recover in fresh medium for the indicated time periods. Cell treatment with the N-linked glycosylation inhibitor, tunicamycin (5 μm, Sigma), was performed in regular culture medium for 1 or 16 h. Cells were washed once in an ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline-EDTA (1 mm) buffer and harvested in a lysis buffer or in passive lysis buffer (Promega; see luciferase activity assay) containing 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 10 mm sodium phosphate, 10% glycerol, 1 mm EDTA, 100 mm NaF, 20 mm β-glycerophosphate, and 1× protease mixture inhibitor (Sigma). After 10 min of incubation on ice, cell lysates were centrifuged for 15 min at 10,000 × g. Luciferase Activity Assay—Transfection of cells was carried out by the calcium phosphate method using the CalPhos mammalian transfection kit (Clontech, BD Biosciences). Briefly, V79 cells were transfected with 5 μg of firefly luciferase reporter plasmids pGL3-promoter vector (Promega) or pGL3-GRP78P(-132)-luc vector (kindly provided by K. Mori, Graduate School of Biostudies, Kyoto, Japan) carrying the ER stress response element (ERSE) and 100 ng of the reference vector pRL-CMV (Promega) carrying the Renilla luciferase gene in 35-mm culture dishes. Cells were then treated with FAA (200 μm) in HBSS for 1 h or with tunicamycin (5 μm) for 16 h in regular medium prior to harvest 48 h following the transfection. Cells were collected in 200 μl of Passive Lysis Buffer (Promega). Both firefly and Renilla luciferase (internal control) activities of cell lysates (40 μl) were measured using the dual luciferase reporter assay system (Promega) on a 1250 luminometer (LKB Wallac). The relative luciferase activity was defined as the ratio of firefly luciferase to Renilla luciferase activity following normalization of the experimental activity of the reporter with the internal control to minimize variability caused by transfection efficiency. Animal Maintenance and NTBC Treatment—The mice used in this study carried the FahΔexon5 deletion as described previously by Grompe et al. (22Grompe M. al-Dhalimy M. Finegold M. Ou C.N. Burlingame T. Kennaway N.G. Soriano P. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 2298-2307Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). FAH mutant mice were treated with 2-(2-nitro-4-trifluoromethylbenzoyl)-1,3 cyclohexanedione (NTBC) kindly provided by S. Lindsted (Gottenburg University, Sweden) at a concentration of 7.5 mg/liter in drinking water. Isolation of Liver Proteins—Frozen liver tissues of NTBC-treated and untreated mice were homogenized on ice in a phosphate-buffered saline solution (pH 7.3) containing 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride using a Teflon pestle. The homogenized extracts were centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. Protein concentrations of the collected supernatants were determined using the Bio-Rad protein assay according to the manufacturer’s recommendations. Western Blot Analysis—The protein extract samples were resolved by electrophoresis on a 12% SDS-PAGE gel, transferred onto a nitrocellulose blotting membrane (BioTrace NT, Pall Life Sciences) for Western blot analysis (23Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44724) Google Scholar), and visualized by the chemiluminescent detection method (Western lightning chemiluminescence reagent, PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Antibodies against KDEL peptide (see Fig. 2A), phosphospecific eIF2α, HO-1, and protein disulfide isomerase (PDI) were purchased from Stressgen. The monoclonal antibody raised against CHOP was obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnologies. The procaspase-12 and procaspase-7 antibodies were purchased from Calbiochem. The GRP78/BiP antibody (see Fig. 4A) was kindly provided by L. Hendershot (St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital), and the Hsp27 and HC8 antibodies were a gift from J. Landry (Hôtel-Dieu Research Center, CHUQ, Quebec). The Hsp70 antibody was described in Tanguay et al. (24Tanguay R.M. Wu Y. Khandjian E.W. Dev. Genet. 1993; 14: 112-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). The β-actin antibody was purchased from NeoMarkers.FIGURE 4Expression of the ER stress proteins in liver homogenates of fah–/– mice taken off NTBC. Livers from control mice (first lane) or fah–/– mice on NTBC treatment or withdrawn from NTBC treatment for a period of 1–5 weeks were collected and homogenized in a phosphate buffer. Liver proteins (20 μg) were loaded on a SDS-PAGE gel and immunoblotted with different antibodies specific to ER stress response proteins (A) or proteins involved in the apoptotic signaling following sustained ER stress (B).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Proteasome Activity Measurements—Frozen liver tissues of NTBC-treated and untreated mice were homogenized on ice in a Tris-HCl (0.1 mol/liter, pH 7.5) and sucrose (0.25 mol/liter), protease inhibitor-free buffer solution, using a Teflon pestle. The homogenized extracts were centrifuged at 10,000 × g for a period of 30 min at 4 °C. Protein concentrations of the collected supernatants were determined as described above. Assays were carried out using 50 μg of liver homogenate proteins diluted in a Tris-HCl buffer (0.1 mol/liter, pH 7.5) to a final volume of 100 μl, containing the succinyl-LLVY-7-amino-4-methylcoumarin amide fluorogenic substrate (40 μm) (Boston Biochem), which measures the chymotrypsin-like activity of the 20 S proteasome. Assays were performed at 37 °C with shaking. Fluorescence was measured at 1-min intervals at excitation and emission wavelengths of 390 and 460 nm, respectively, on an Ascent FL Fluoroskan (Thermo Labsystems). Lactacystin (Boston Biochem), an irreversible inhibitor of the chymotrypsin- and trypsin-like activities of the proteasome, was added at a concentration of 25 μm prior to the measurements. Statistical Analyses—Statistical analyses were carried out following the methods outlined in Ref. 25Zar J.H. Biostatistical Analysis.2nd Ed. Simon & Schuster Co., Englewood Cliffs, NJ1984: 122-149Google Scholar, except when otherwise mentioned. Homogeneity of variances was verified using an Fmax test (26Sokal R.R. Rohlf F.J. Biometry: The Principles and Practice of Statistics in Biological Research.3rd Ed. W. H. Freeman and Co., New York1995: 392-450Google Scholar). Accordingly, comparisons between the two samples were done using Student’s t test or its nonparametric equivalent. A p value comparison (a posteriori) was done using the Bonferroni sequential technique (27Rice W.R. Evolution. 1989; 43: 223-225Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Data are presented as mean ± S.D. p values less than 0.05 were deemed statistically significant. FAA Treatment of V79 Cells Induces the Transcriptional Activity of the ERSE—Previous work done in our laboratory showed that in addition to causing Golgi disruption, exogenous FAA (100 μm) also caused an increase in intracellular Ca 2+ levels in V79 Chinese hamster lung cells (8Jorquera R. Tanguay R.M. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2001; 10: 1741-1752Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). These observations prompted us to examine the effects of exogenous FAA on the ER function. Among the early events to occur upon the ER stress is the induction of the GRP78/BiP chaperone, the key regulator protein of the UPR of the ER stress, which is transcriptionally regulated. Transcriptional regulation of GRP78/BiP is mediated by the binding of transcription factors to the ERSE, a cis-acting element present in the promoter region of GRP78/BiP and other ER chaperones such as GRP94 and calreticulin (28Yoshida H. Haze K. Yanagi H. Yura T. Mori K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33741-33749Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1004) Google Scholar). To determine whether FAA induced an ER stress response in V79 cells, we measured the transcriptional activity of the ERSE in V79 cells transfected with a luciferase reporter vector carrying the ERSE upstream of the SV40 promoter following FAA treatment. As can be seen in Fig. 1, FAA (200 μm) treatment of V79-pGL3-GRP78P(-132)-luc vector-transfected cells causes an early (1 h) (∼ 2.1-fold) increase in relative luciferase activity compared with the control cells. Tunicamycin, an inhibitor of protein N-linked glycosylation that induces the UPR as a result of the ER stress, resulted in a ∼3.6-fold increase in relative luciferase activity compared with the control cells. These results show that FAA induces the ERSE transcriptional activity and the ER chaperone GRP78/BiP, which is the key regulator of the UPR pathway. Exogenous FAA Elicits the ER Stress Response Pathway in V79 Cells—Next, we examined the effects of exogenous FAA on the ER stress-regulated proteins (Fig. 2). V79 cells were treated for 2 h with FAA (100 μm) in HBSS and left to recover in fresh medium for the indicated time periods. Fig. 2A shows an early induction of GRP78/BiP (from 1 to 4 h following the treatment) accompanied by a simultaneous eIF2α phosphorylation which is at a maximum at 1 h post-treatment with an increase in its phosphorylation state compared to control cells (Fig. 2B). The expression of the oxidoreductase PDI was also analyzed. PDI is involved in the rearrangement of incorrect protein disulfides (reviewed in Refs. 29Tu B.P. Weissman J.S. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 164: 341-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (806) Google Scholar and 30Ellgaard L. Ruddock L.W. EMBO Rep. 2005; 6: 28-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (623) Google Scholar) and has been reported to be induced by the UPR. However, no induction of the PDI was observed (Fig. 2A). Likewise, there was no visible induction of the HC8 protein from the α-subunit of the 20 S proteasome suggestive of the ERAD. FAA treatment also resulted in late activation of the proapoptotic CHOP transcription factor (Fig. 2C) with peak expression levels at 10 and 22 h following the treatment. Another late event was the activation of the ER resident caspase-12 (Fig. 2C). At 22 h post-treatment, the level of uncleaved or inactive procaspase-12 was approximately one-third of the control, a level similar to that of the cells treated with tunicamycin, a potent inducer of the ER stress which also causes apoptosis (31Perez-Sala D. Mollinedo F. J. Cell. Physiol. 1995; 163: 523-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 32Chang J.Y. Korolev V.V. Exp. Neurol. 1996; 137: 201-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). There was no evidence of ER stress associated with HBSS alone for the recovery periods studied (data not shown). Taken together, these results indicate that V79 cells exposed to FAA respond by activating the ER stress response pathway leading to apoptosis signaling. A late caspase-3-dependent cell death of FAA-treated V79 cells was previously demonstrated (7Jorquera R. Tanguay R.M. FASEB J. 1999; 13: 2284-2298Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Because ER stress may be induced by different cellular stress stimuli including oxidative stress and previous studies suggested that oxidative stress may occur in HTI (33Dieter M.Z. Freshwater S.L. Miller M.L. Shertzer H.G. Dalton T.P. Nebert D.W. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2003; 35: 351-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 34Vogel A. van den Berg I.E. Al-Dhalimy M. Groopman J. Ou C.N. Ryabinina O. Iordanov M.S. Finegold M. Grompe M. Hepatology. 2004; 39: 433-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), we also examined the effects of FAA on other cellular stress proteins that may confer protection against the oxidative stress. FAA treatment of V79 cells caused a slight and late (10 and 22 h) induction of HO-1, a marker of oxidative stress (Fig. 3). Both the 70-kDa and 27-kDa heat shock proteins (Hsp70 and Hsp27, respectively) were also slightly induced following the FAA treatment. Their induction occurred late (10–22 h post-treatment) compared with the induction of the proximal ER stress proteins (1–4 h post-treatment) (Fig. 3). Retrieval from NTBC Treatment of fah–/– Mice Induces an ER Stress Response in Liver Cells—Because the assays described so far involved an in vitro cellular model using exogenous FAA as the sole metabolite tested, we next used a HTI murine model (22Grompe M. al-Dhalimy M. Finegold M. Ou C.N. Burlingame T. Kennaway N.G. Soriano P. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 2298-2307Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar) to investigate the implication of the ER stress response in vivo. To mimic the HTI phenotype, we used fah knock-out mice taken off the therapeutic NTBC drug used in human HTI patients. Homogenates of liver tissue obtained from mice taken off NTBC for up to 5 weeks were used to determine whether the ER stress response was elicited in vivo as well. Fig. 4A shows an induction of GRP78/BiP from 3 to 5 weeks following NTBC withdrawal. There was a slight elevation of the eIF2α phosphorylation in liver samples from mice recently taken off NTBC followed by a pronounced increase in phosphorylation at 5 weeks. In contrast to FAA-treated V79 cells, livers of mice taken off NTBC showed an induction of PDI after NTBC withdrawal. We next examined the expression levels of proapoptotic proteins induced by the ER stress. As shown in Fig. 4B, there is an induction of CHOP following NTBC withdrawal. Further evidence supporting the activation of apoptotic signaling in the liver of untreated fah–/– mice is the reduced levels of the uncleaved forms of procaspase-7 and -12 as early as 1 week (procaspase-7) or 2 weeks (procaspase-12) after discontinuing NTBC treatment (Fig. 4B). fah–/– Mice Taken Off NTBC Treatment Display Increased Levels of Proteasome Activity in Liver Cells—Because the results obtained from fah–/– mice taken off NTBC treatment suggested that hepatic cells from these mice were subjected to the ER stress and that the ER stress may lead to the ERAD, we measured the proteasome activity of liver homogenates from these mice. Data from Fig. 5A demonstrate that NTBC withdrawal caused an ∼2-fold increase in proteasome activity as compared with wild-type mice. Furthermore, the proteasome activity measured in wild-type mice was not significantly different from that measured in NTBC-treated fah–/– mice despite increased levels of HC8 expression in these mice (Fig. 5B). Lactacystin, an inhibitor of the chymotrypsin- and trypsin-like activities of the proteasome, was used as a control for activity measurements. Fig. 5B shows that the HC8 protein of the 20 S proteasome is only slightly induced in the liver of fah–/– mice taken off NTBC treatment. Interestingly, fah–/– mice treated with NTBC also showed some increase in the levels of HC8 expression although higher levels of HC8 expression were observed progressively from 3 to 5 weeks after NTBC treatment was discontinued. The origin of the minor band appearing below HC8 in fah–/– NTBC-off mice (Fig. 5B) is unknown. However, because the 20 S proteasome HC8 subunit is reported to possess two phosphorylation sites (35Castano J.G. Mahillo E. Arizti P. Arribas J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 3782-3789Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), the minor band below HC8 may represent its dephosphorylated form. Therefore, mice with the tyrosinemic phenotype seem to undergo ERAD as a result of the ER stress. NTBC Treatment Withdrawal in fah–/– Mice Induces Cell Stress Proteins in Liver Cells—Results from FAA-treated V79 cells showed that FAA induces different stress proteins such as HO-1, Hsp70, and Hsp27. This led us to examine if these proteins were also induced in fah–/– mice removed from NTBC treatment. Results shown in Fig. 6 demonstrate that there is an induction of Hsp27 in mice taken off NTBC for the period of 2 to 5 weeks following NTBC withdrawal. The 70-kDa heat shock protein is also induced in these mice with a maximum induction at 2 weeks. However, even fah–/– mice under NTBC treatment show a slight induction of Hsp70. HO-1 is also induced as soon as 1 week following NTBC withdrawal, implying that FAH deficiency may cause oxidative stress. We previously reported that FAA displayed mutagenic and apoptogenic activities in vitro (6Jorquera R. Tanguay R.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 232: 42-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 7Jorquera R. Tanguay R.M. FASEB J. 1999; 13: 2284-2298Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). In addition, FAA causes genetic instability and Golgi apparatus disruption (8Jorquera R. Tanguay R.M. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2001; 10: 1741-1752Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). We now report that FAA elicits an ER stress response. Results obtained from V79 cells treated with exogenous FAA support the hypothesis that FAA causes a disruption of the ER function. The first evidence of the ER stress in these cells is the early activation of GRP78/BiP, a proximal signaling protein, functioning as the key regulator of the three transducers of the UPR. Phosphorylation of eIF2α inhibits general protein synthesis by preventing the assembly of the 80 S ribosome. Since eIF2α is a direct substrate of the PERK transducer kinase, it is phosphorylated at an early stage of the ER stress response. eIF2α phosphorylation and translational repression were reported to occur as early as 30 min following exposure to a stress-inducing stimulus (36Novoa I. Zhang Y. Zeng H. Jungreis R. Harding H.P. Ron D. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 1180-1187Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). However, phosphorylation of eIF2α can be induced by many"
https://openalex.org/W2058655080,"A significant number of fatal diseases are classified as protein deposition disorders, in which a normally soluble protein is deposited in an insoluble amyloid form. It has been reported that tetracycline exhibits anti-amyloidogenic activity by inhibiting aggregate formation and disaggregating preformed fibrils. In this work, we examined the effect induced by the presence of tetracycline on the fibrillogenesis and cytotoxicity of the amyloid-forming apomyoglobin mutant W7FW14F. Like other amyloid-forming proteins, early prefibrillar aggregates formed by this protein are highly cytotoxic, whereas insoluble mature fibrils are not. The effect induced by tetracycline on the fibrillation process has been examined by atomic force microscopy, light scattering, DPH staining, and thioflavin T fluorescence. The cytotoxicity of the amyloid aggregates was estimated by measuring cell viability using MTT assay. The results show that tetracycline acts as anti-aggregating agent, which inhibits the fibril elongation process but not the early aggregation steps leading to the formation of soluble oligomeric aggregates. Thus, this inhibition keeps the W7FW14F mutant in a prefibrillar, highly cytotoxic state. In this respect, a careful usage of tetracycline as fibril inhibitor is indicated."
https://openalex.org/W1971374133,"The Arf1-directed GTPase-activating protein ArfGAP1 is a Golgi-localized protein that controls the dynamics of the COPI coat of carriers that mediate transport in the endoplasmic reticulum-Golgi shuttle. Previously the interaction of ArfGAP1 with the Golgi was allocated to a portion of the non-catalytic, carboxyl part of the protein, but the mechanism of this interaction has not been established. In this study we identify a short stretch in the non-catalytic part of ArfGAP1 (residues 204–214) in which several hydrophobic residues contribute to Golgi localization. Even single alanine replacement of two of these residues (Leu-207 and Trp-211) strongly diminished Golgi localization. Mutations in the hydrophobic residues also diminished the in vitro activity of ArfGAP1 on Arf1 bound to Golgi membranes. The stretch containing the hydrophobic residues was recently shown to mediate the binding of ArfGAP1 to loosely packed lipids of highly curved liposomes (Bigay, J., Casella, J. F., Drin, G., Mesmin, B., and Antonny, B. (2005) EMBO J. 24, 2244–2253). Whereas short fragments containing the hydrophobic stretch were not Golgi-localized, a proximal 10-residue in-frame insertion that is present in new ArfGAP1 isoforms that we identified in brain and heart tissues could confer Golgi localization on these fragments. This localization was abrogated by alanine replacement of residues Phe-240 or Trp-241 of the insertion sequence but not by their replacement with leucines. Our findings indicate that ArfGAP1 interacts with the Golgi through multiple hydrophobic motifs and that alternative modes of interaction may exist in tissue-specific ArfGAP1 isoforms.

The COPII system mediates the initial exit from the endoplasmic reticulum, whereas subsequent transport to the Golgi apparatus and retrograde Golgi to endoplasmic reticulum traffic involves COPI carriers. The COPI and COPII coats are composed of evolutionarily distinct sets of proteins yet follow similar pathways of coat assembly and disassembly (for recent reviews see Refs. 1.Bonifacino J.S.

Following activation by a guanine nucleotide exchange protein, the GTPase translocates from cytosol to the organelle membrane, where it initiates the process of coat formation by the direct binding of coat subunits (4.Barlowe C.

The coat in turn recruits cargo and polymerizes causing membrane deformation to form a bud. In the second phase of the GTPase cycle of Arf1 and Sar1, bound GTP is hydrolyzed with the aid of a GTPase-activating protein (GAP). The hydrolysis of GTP is a prerequisite for coat dissociation, and its inhibition leads to the accumulation of coated vesicles that are prevented from fusing with the target membrane (4.Barlowe C.

ArfGAPs constitute a large family of proteins containing a highly conserved catalytic domain of ∼130 residues with a characteristic zinc finger structure, whereas the non-catalytic parts are highly diverse (9.Randazzo P.A.

A unique feature of ArfGAP1 is its avid interaction with loosely packed lipids presented by liposomes containing diacylglycerols (22.Antonny B. Huber I. Paris S. Chabre M. Cassel D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30848-30851Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar) or by small liposomes where the high curvature of the bilayer creates open spaces between the phospholipid acyl chains (23.Bigay J.

EMBO J. 2005; 24: 2244-2253Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). The response of ArfGAP1 to membrane curvature was proposed to serve as a mechanism for the regulation of GTP hydrolysis during bud formation. Thus the positive curvature in the central region of the bud would cause ArfGAP1 recruitment and hence facilitate GTP hydrolysis on Arf1, whose presence may not be required following the polymerization of the coat, whereas the negative curvature in the bud rims would exclude ArfGAP1 from this region, allowing Arf1·GTP-dependent recruitment of new coat subunits (23.Bigay J.

Whereas the catalytic domain of ArfGAP1 contains the machinery required for the catalysis of GTP hydrolysis (17.Goldberg J.

Roth M.G. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 2559-2570Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The non-catalytic part mediates the interaction of ArfGAP1 with loosely packed lipids (24.Bigay J. Casella J.F. Drin G. Mesmin B. Antonny B. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 2244-2253Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar) and is also involved in protein-protein interactions, as demonstrated for the interaction of ArfGAP1 with the COPI cargo, the KDEL receptor (29.Aoe T.

Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20545-20549Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). However, a role of any of these interactions in the Golgi localization of ArfGAP1 has not been established. Here we report the identification of a short stretch within the non-catalytic part of ArfGAP1 containing hydrophobic residues that are necessary for Golgi localization. These residues closely match those recently reported to constitute a lipid-binding motif in ArfGAP1 (24.Bigay J. Casella J.F. Drin G. Mesmin B. Antonny B. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 2244-2253Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar), suggesting a role of lipid binding in ArfGAP1 targeting. We also describe new tissue-specific ArfGAP1 isoforms that contain a small in-frame insertion and deletion in proximity to the lipid-binding motif and provide evidence that these insertion and deletion regions function as Golgi localization determinants. DNA Constructs and Transfection—GFP fusion proteins were prepared by cloning PCR-amplified fragments of ArfGAP1 cDNA into the pEGFP-C2 vector (Clontech) using the EcoRI and BamHI sites. To facilitate the introduction of point mutations, silent mutations were introduced in the codons for amino acids 209–210 (from TCGGGC to TCCGGA) creating a BspEI site. Primers that included point mutations and a BspEI extension were used in PCR amplification of either amino- or carboxyl-terminal fragments, and the products were used to replace the corresponding fragment in the non-mutated GFP fusion plasmid. Plasmids encoding myc-tagged ArfGAP1 and its mutants were prepared by PCR amplification of the ArfGAP1 coding region in the corresponding GFP fusion constructs and cloning the products into the pCDNA3.1/myc-His(–)B vector (from Invitrogen) using the EcoRI and BamHI sites. Plasmids (0.2 μg) were transfected into cells grown on 13-mm glass coverslips in 24-well plates using 0.3 μl of FuGENE 6 (Roche Diagnostics) according to the manufacturer's instructions. GFP-fused constructs were transfected into HeLa cells, whereas myc-tagged constructs were transfected into HeLa cells stably expressing N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase-2 (GalNAc-T2) fused to GFP (31.Storrie B. White J. Rottger S. Stelzer E.H. Suganuma T. Nilsson T. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1505-1521Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). Cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde 20–24 h following transfection. Labeling with Antibodies and Fluorescence Microscopy—For immunostaining, coverslips were transferred into PSS (phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.05% saponin and 0.2% bovine serum albumin), and incubated with a monoclonal antibody against GM130 (from Transduction Laboratories, 1:500) or against the myc epitope (clone 9E10, from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, 1:100), followed by CY3-conjugated donkey anti-mouse IgG (ImmunoResearch Laboratories, 1:400). Coverslips were mounted on glass slides using Mowiol as glue and were visualized under a Leica DMIRE2 inverted fluorescent microscope at a 40× magnification. Preparation of Recombinant ArfGAP1 and Its Mutants—ArfGAP1 cDNA containing silent mutations avoiding rare codon usage (19.Lee S.Y. Yang J.S. Hong W. Premont R.T. Hsu V.W. J. Cell Biol. 2005; 168: 281-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) was subjected to PCR amplification with primers that included a 5′-XbaI site and a 3′-BamHI site, generating PCR products encoding residues 6–415. These were cloned into the T7 polymerase-driven pKM260 vector between the NheI and the BamHI sites. Mutations were introduced by two-stage PCR. Proteins were expressed in the BL21/DE3 Escherichia coli strain harboring pLysS by induction for 3 h at 30°C in the presence of 0.1 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside. Bacterial pellets were extracted with 6 m guanidine hydrochloride, and proteins were purified to near homogeneity by nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid chromatography followed by dialysis and Resource Q chromatography as previously described (27.Szafer E. Pick E. Rotman M. Zuck S. Huber I. Cassel D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23615-23619Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). GAP Activity Assays—Measurement of GAP activity on Golgi membranes was carried out as previously described (18.Szafer E. Rotman M. Cassel D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 47834-47839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Briefly, recombinant myristoylated Arf1 (32.Franco M. Chardin P. Chabre M. Paris S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24531-24534Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was loaded with [γ-32P]GTP onto rat liver Golgi membranes (33.Lanoix J. Ouwendijk J. Lin C.C. Stark A. Love H.D. Ostermann J. Nilsson T. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4935-4948Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar) using the guanine nucleotide exchange activity that is present in the membrane. The exchange activity was stopped by the addition of 0.3 mm brefeldin-A and was followed 1 min later (zero time) by the addition of GAP. Following different incubation times at 30 °C, samples were filtered through a nitrocellulose filter, and the amount of radioactivity remaining on the filter (representing Arf1-bound GTP) was determined. GAP activity on the Arf1 mutant lacking the first 17 residues (Δ17-Arf1, ref. 17.Goldberg J. Cell. 1999; 96: 893-902Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar) loaded with [γ-32P]GTP was measured in the absence of membranes as described (27.Szafer E. Pick E. Rotman M. Zuck S. Huber I. Cassel D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23615-23619Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) except that the assay buffer contained 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 25 mm MOPS, pH 7.5. Following incubation with GAP for different times at 30 °C, samples were transferred to a charcoal suspension, which was subjected to centrifugation, and the amount of radioactivity in the supernatant (representing 32Pi) was determined. Screening for ArfGAP1 Isoforms—cDNAs of various rat tissues were obtained from BD Biosciences (Rat MTC™ Panel I, catalog number K1429-1). These were subjected to PCR amplification using primers encompassing either the entire coding sequence (sense, GCCAGCCCAAGAACCAGAAA, antisense, GGCTCCTACCAGTTCTGGTTGTC) or a carboxyl-terminal fragment (sense, ATGACTTCCTCAACAGCGCCAT, antisense primer as above), and PCR products were cloned into the pDrive vector (Qiagen) and sequenced. Preparation of Antipeptide Antibodies That Specifically Recognize the ArfGAP1 Isoforms—Antibodies against the insertion peptide that is present in the brain/heart isoforms was prepared as follows. A peptide representing the insertion peptide with three residues on each side from the flanking ArfGAP1 sequence and amino-terminal cysteine residue, CSQKFWGYKQQSEPASE, was synthesized, conjugated to keyhole limpet hemocyanin, and injected into rabbits; the entire procedure was carried out by Sigma (Rehovot, Israel). Serum was prepared from the fourth and fifth boosts. Western Blot Analysis—Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE (10% gels) and transferred to nitrocellulose sheets, which were blocked in phosphate-buffered saline containing 5% defatted milk and 0.1% Tween 20. Blots were incubated with primary antibodies diluted in blocking buffer using the following antibodies/dilutions: polyclonal anti-Arf-GAP1 (11.Cukierman E. Huber I. Rotman M. Cassel D. Science. 1995; 270: 1999-2002Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar), 1:10,000; anti-ArfGAP1 isoform insertion peptide, 1:3000; anti-GFP (from Santa Cruz Biotechnology), 1:500. Blots were then incubated with horseradish peroxidase-coupled secondary antibodies and were developed by the enhanced chemiluminescence system. Identification of a Golgi Localization Determinant in the Non-catalytic Part of ArfGAP1—Previously, Yu and Roth (28.Yu S. Roth M.G. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 2559-2570Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) have demonstrated by the expression of GFP fusion constructs that the non-catalytic part of ArfGAP1 contains information for Golgi targeting, whereas the catalytic part alone is not Golgi localized. They further demonstrated that a fragment encompassing residues 203–334 still shows Golgi localization, whereas fragments starting at residue 252 or ending at residue 280 are not localized. We sought to further define the minimal Golgi localization domain by introducing small truncations at either side of the non-catalytic fragment. Determination of the carboxyl border of the localization domain was not straightforward, as we observed a gradual decrease in the percentage of cells with clear Golgi localization in a series of truncated mutants ending between residues 280 and 359. 4A. Parnis, M. Rawet, L. Regev, B. Barkan, M. Rotman, M. Gaitner, and D. Cassel, unpublished results. By contrast, a sharp border could be defined at the amino side (Fig. 1A). In these experiments, we tested the localization of GFP fusions of carboxyl-terminal fragments that contained a series of small truncations at the amino side of ArfGAP1 and extended to the last residue of the protein. In agreement with the findings of Yu and Roth (28.Yu S. Roth M.G. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 2559-2570Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), the 203–415 fragment showed good Golgi localization that coincided with the cis-Golgi marker GM130 and resembled that of the entire non-catalytic domain (residues 143–415). However, fragments with further truncations at the amino side (210–415 and 219–415) showed strongly diminished Golgi localization. Western blot analysis (Fig. 1B) showed that the different constructs gave rise to proteins of the expected size, indicating that the abrogated Golgi localization in the shorter constructs was not because of degradation. We next tested the role of individual residues within the region whose deletion abrogated Golgi localization (residues 204–215). To avoid any effects of the GFP linker that might be manifested in fusion constructs that start close to the mutated region, the mutations were introduced into the full non-catalytic fragment (residues 143–415). As shown in Fig. 2, single alanine replacements of several hydrophobic residues diminished Golgi localization of the ArfGAP1 non-catalytic fragment. This effect was most pronounced with residue Leu-207, where alanine replacement essentially abolished Golgi localization. A W211A mutation also strongly diminished Golgi localization, although weak Golgi fluorescence was still apparent in some cells (Fig. 2, arrowheads). In M204A and F214A mutants, Golgi localization was diminished but to a lesser extent, whereas replacement of M204 with aspartate abrogated Golgi localization, as did a double M204A/W211A mutation. In contrast to the effect of the W211A mutation, replacement of this residue with other hydrophobic residues (Leu or Phe) did not abrogate Golgi localization. Unlike the hydrophobic residues, alanine replacement of serine/threonine residues that are abundant in this region (residues 205/206, 212, and 215) did not diminish the Golgi localization of the non-catalytic fragment. Western blot analysis demonstrated that all mutants were expressed at the expected size (data not shown). To test whether the point mutations that abrogate Golgi localization affect the GAP function of ArfGAP1 in cells, we tested the effect of overexpression of full-length ArfGAP1 and its mutants on the Golgi apparatus. This assay is based on our previous finding (21.Huber I. Cukierman E. Rotman M. Aoe T. Hsu V.W. Cassel D. J. Biol.

As shown in Fig. 3A, the full-length GFP-ArfGAP1 was Golgi-localized in cells expressing low to moderate levels of the fusion protein, but not in mutants containing double alanine replacements of hydrophobic residues (M204A/L207A, M204A/W211A) or a single alanine replacement of Trp-211. Staining with antibodies directed against the Golgi marker GM130 revealed that the Golgi apparatus was dispersed in cells expressing high levels of wild-type GFP-ArfGAP1, but remained intact in cells expressing similar levels of the mutants. These findings suggest that the interaction of ArfGAP1 with the Golgi through the stretch of hydrophobic residues is necessary for the in vivo activity of the protein. The results reported thus far were obtained with GFP fusions of Arf-GAP1. Although GFP fusion proteins are commonly used to study the dynamics of proteins in cells, we sought to verify the results using a smaller tag. To this end, we expressed full-length ArfGAP1 constructs in the pCDNA3.1/myc-His vector encoding carboxyl-terminal additions of a myc epitope and a hexahistidine stretch. In these experiments the status of the Golgi apparatus was tracked by using HeLa cells stably expressing a GFP-fused Golgi enzyme, GalNAc-T2 (31.Storrie B. White J. Rottger S. Stelzer E.H. Suganuma T. Nilsson T. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1505-1521Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 3B, the results obtained with myc-tagged ArfGAP1 constructs were similar to those obtained with the corresponding GFP-fused constructs. Thus, at relatively low expression levels the wild-type protein was Golgi-localized, whereas mutants containing double alanine replacement of the hydrophobic residues showed cytosolic distribution. At high expression levels, the wild-type ArfGAP1 caused a dispersal of the Golgi, whereas the mutants had little effect. Effect of Mutations on GAP Activity at the Golgi Membrane—Bigay et al. (24.Bigay J. Casella J.F. Drin G. Mesmin B. Antonny B. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 2244-2253Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar) have recently demonstrated that mutations in the hydrophobic residues that were found in this study to be important for Golgi localization diminish the ability of ArfGAP1 to interact with tiny liposomes and to induce GTP hydrolysis on Arf1 bound to such liposomes. We sought to determine whether these mutations also affect ArfGAP1-induced GTP hydrolysis on Golgi membrane-bound Arf1. This was tested by using our previously described assay (18.Szafer E. Rotman M. Cassel D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 47834-47839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), where Arf1 is loaded with [γ-32P]GTP at the Golgi membrane by membrane-bound guanine nucleotide exchange proteins, and the effect of GAP is subsequently assayed as a decrease in the amount of membrane-bound radioactivity following the release of the radiolabeled phosphate from GTP. Full-length ArfGAP1 and its mutants were employed in these assays (Fig. 4A). Whereas wild-type ArfGAP1 caused a rapid decrease in membrane-bound radioactivity, double replacement of Met-204 and Leu-207 with alanines resulted in a strongly diminished activity. A mutant with triple alanine replacement of Met-204, Leu-207 and Trp-211 did not increase GTP hydrolysis above the basal level observed in the absence of added GAP. By contrast, as shown in Fig. 4B, ArfGAP1 and its mutants showed similar activity when assayed in the absence of membranes using a lipid-independent Arf1 mutant lacking the first 17 residues (17.Goldberg J. Cell. 1999; 96: 893-902Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar, 35.Paris S. Beraud-Dufour S. Robineau S. Bigay J. Antonny B. Chabre M. Chardin P. J. Biol.

ArfGAP1 Isoforms and Their Interaction with the Golgi—We previously isolated cDNA library clones that appeared to represent ArfGAP1 splice isoforms (11.Cukierman E. Huber I. Rotman M. Cassel D. Science. 1995; 270: 1999-2002Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar), 5Genomic data now reveal that some of the variants previously described probably represent misspliced RNA. and the possible existence of additional isoforms is suggested by multiple data bank sequences from several mammalian sources. In the present study we reinvestigated whether ArfGAP1 isoforms exist in different rat tissues and analyzed the interaction of new isoforms that we identified with the Golgi complex. The expression of ArfGAP1 isoforms was analyzed by subjecting cDNAs from several rat tissues to PCR amplification of the entire or the 3′-part of the ArfGAP1 coding region. Sequencing of multiple clones of PCR products from each tissue revealed the existence of two new isoforms containing small in-frame insertion/deletion (Fig. 5A). In heart tissue, we detected an isoform containing a 10-residue insertion following residue 239, whereas in brain tissue we observed an isoform containing the same insertion together with a proximal in-frame deletion of 22 residues (residues 259–280). Only the form originally identified in the liver (11.Cukierman E. Huber I. Rotman M. Cassel D. Science. 1995; 270: 1999-2002Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar) was detected in the other rat tissues examined; this form was also detected in PCR clones from heart and brain alongside with the variant forms. To determine the relative abundance of isoforms in heart and brain tissues, products of PCR amplification of a ∼500-bp fragment were subjected to restriction analysis using NaeI that cuts this fragment uniquely within the region encoding the 10-amino-acid insertion and BsaI that cuts uniquely within the region that is deleted in the brain isoform.

https://openalex.org/W2056875320,"From a neuronal cDNA library of the cockroach Periplaneta americana we isolated a 3585-bp cDNA sequence encoding Periplaneta transient receptor potential γ (pTRPγ), a protein of 1194 amino acids showing 65% identity to the orthologous Drosophila channel protein dTRPγ. Heterologous expression of pTRPγ in HEK293 cells produced a constitutively active, non-selective cation channel with a Ca2+:Na+ permeability ratio of 2. In contrast to dTRPγ-mediated currents, pTRPγ currents were partially inhibited by 8-bromo-cAMP, and this effect was not mediated by protein kinase A (PKA) activation. pTRPγb, a truncated pTRPγ splice variant missing most of the C terminus, was insensitive to 8-bromo-cAMP. Thus, the critical cAMP-binding site seems to be located in the C-terminal part of pTRPγ, although there is no common cAMP-binding consensus sequence. While dTRPγ is only expressed in the photoreceptors, pTRPγ is expressed throughout the nervous system. In particular it is expressed in dorsal unpaired median (DUM) neurons. In these octopamine-releasing, neurosecretory cells a Ca2+ background current contributing to pacemaker activity was found to be up-regulated by the reduction of cAMP level. In addition, the Ca2+ background current was inhibited by LOE-908, 2-APB, and La3+, which similarly affected the pTRPγ current. We thus propose that the pTRPγ protein is involved in forming the channel passing the Ca2+ pakemaking background current in DUM neurons.

(transient receptor potential) family form cation-selective and Ca2+-permeable ion channels with multiple functions (1Clapham D.E. Nature. 2003; 426: 517-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (2081) Google Scholar). The first TRP channel was described in Drosophila photoreceptors where mutants lacking this channel showed a transient receptor potential upon continuous light stimulation (2Minke B. Biophys. Struct. Mech. 1977; 3: 59-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). In the fly photoreceptors two further TRP proteins, TRPL and TRPγ (3Xu X.Z. Chien F. Butler A. Salkoff L. Montell C. Neuron. 2000; 26: 647-657Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar), contribute to visual transduction (4Clapham D.E. Montell C. Schultz G. Julius D. Pharmacol. Rev. 2003; 55: 591-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). TRP proteins have six transmembrane segments, and most of them probably assemble to homoor heterotetramers to form ion channels. The superfamily of TRP channels has been grouped into several subfamilies (1Clapham D.E. Nature. 2003; 426: 517-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (2081) Google Scholar, 5Montell C. Science's STKE 2005. 2005; : re3Google Scholar). Members of the mammalian TRPC (canonical TRP) family show the highest homology with the Drosophila TRP/TRPL/TRPγ variants. These channels appear to be receptor-operated in that they are activated by a variety of stimuli that lead to activation of phospholipase C (PLC). The modulation of pacemaker conductances is a basic principle to adjust the neuronal activity to the physiological requirements. Certain peptide hormones affect ion channels involved in the regulation of pacemaking. Previous investigations on identified insect neurosecretory neurons, namely efferent dorsal unpaired median (DUM) neurons in the cockroach Periplaneta americana, have shown that a voltage-independent Ca2+ background current providing for non-capacitative Ca2+ entry (NCCE) changes the spike frequency of these cells. For example, up-regulation of this current by the Periplaneta adipokinetic hormone AKH I (pAKH I: pQ-V-N-F-S-P-N-W·NH2, also named neurohormone D (6Baumann E. Penzlin H. Biomed. Biochim. Acta. 1984; 43: K13-K16PubMed Google Scholar)), accelerates spiking (7Wicher D. Walther C. Penzlin H. J. Comp. Physiol. A. 1994; 174: 507-515Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 8Wicher D. Messutat S. Lavialle C. Lapied B. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 50410-50419Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). A detailed analysis of the signal transduction mechanism, by which AKH I binding to the receptor leads to potentiation of Ca2+ background current, revealed a complex pattern of events including activation of PLC but no apparent contribution from intracellular Ca2+ stores (8Wicher D. Messutat S. Lavialle C. Lapied B. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 50410-50419Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The final event of the signal transduction cascade was the down-regulation of the cAMP level, which directly enhanced the background current. Up-regulation of the cAMP level in DUM neurons attenuates the Ca2+ background current and thus the spike frequency (9Achenbach H. Walther C. Wicher D. Neuroreport. 1997; 8: 3737-3741Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). We were interested in identifying the molecular basis for the Ca2+ background current in DUM neurons and thus looked for a channel that (i) may conduct a voltage-independent Ca2+ current and (ii) that is sensitive to cAMP. Since TRP channels are known to fulfill the first criterion, we screened a Periplaneta cDNA library for putative members of the TRPC family. We succeded in finding a Periplaneta homolog to the Drosophila TRPγ channel. In the present study, we report an unusual regulation of this TRP channel. We demonstrate that the Periplaneta but not the Drosophila TRPγ channel is downregulated by cAMP. Based on an analysis of the pharmacological profile of the Periplaneta TRPγ channel we propose that it is involved in forming the channel that conducts the Ca2+ background current in DUM neurons. Degenerated RT-PCR and RACE Protocols—RNA from isolated Periplaneta thoracic and abdominal ganglia were isolated using the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) and reverse-transcribed using Superscript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen, Karlsruhe, Germany). According to sequence homologies between the three Drosophila melanogaster TRP channels dTRP (GenBank™ accession number M34394), dTRPL (GenBank™ accession number M88185), and dTRPγ (GenBank™ accession number AJ277968) several degenerated primers were designed. Among these primers one pair (5′-tggtaygarggattgcc-3′ coding for WYEGLP; 5′-gghcccagrtgcggatt-3′ coding for NPHLGP) amplified a ∼650-bp fragment from the ganglial cDNA with strong homology to dTRPγ using AmpliTaq Gold polymerase (Applied Biosystems, Darmstadt, Germany). To obtain the full-length pTRPγ sequence we performed nested touch-down 5′- and 3′-RACE experiments as described previously (10Derst C. Messutat S. Walther C. Eckert M. Heinemann S.H. Wicher D. Eur. J. Neurosci. 2003; 17: 1197-1212Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) using pTRPγ-specific primers and a Periplaneta americana mixed tissue Marathon RACE library (RACE-F1, 5′-tgtacgtggcaaccgtggcact-3′; RACE-F2, 5′-gccgccaaggtgcaaacgtc-3′; RACE-B1, 5′-cgaaccactcgccgatcacaga-3′; RACE-B2, 5′-tgcgacgccaggatcagcag-3′). PCR and RACE products were either sequenced directly or cloned into pGEM-T (Promega, Mannheim, Germany) for sequencing. RT-PCR Analysis of Periplaneta Tissues—A nested RT-PCR approach was developed for testing ganglion-specific expression and single-cell analysis of isolated DUM neurons. The following intron-spanning PCR primers were designed: Sc-F1, 5′-cagaaagaacgtcggctcat-3′; Sc-F2, 5′-caactgcccactgtagcaga-3′; Sc-B1, 5′-gggactgttgctgtggctat-3′; Sc-B2, 5′-cagagtcttccgacctgctc-3′. For single-cell RT-PCR analysis of pTRPγ expression the cytosol of single DUM neurons was harvested with patch pipettes and directly transferred to the RT reaction mixture. RT reaction was performed with either Superscript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) and ganglion RNA or with Sensiscript reverse transcriptase (Qiagen) and isolated cytosol of single DUM neurons as described by the manufacturer, respectively. The two nested PCR reactions were performed with AmpliTaq Gold polymerase (Applied Biosystems) with initial 6 min at 94 °C enzyme activation followed by 40 cycles 30 s at 94 °C; 30 s at 55 °C; 1 min at 72 °C. PCR products of the second PCR reaction were visualized on a 2% agarose gel. As a positive control we amplified part of a ubiquitously expressed actin gene from P. americana. Construction of a pTRPγ pIRES2-EGFP Expression Vector (HEK293 Expression)—Full-length pTRPγ was amplified using Advantage TaqII DNA polymerase mixture (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA) and ganglion cDNA using the following three primers: FL-for 1, 5′-aaaggcctcgagatgagtgacaattatgacgtg-3′; FL-for 2, 5′-acagcatcctcgagatgatggaggaggagaacgtc-3′; and FL-rev, 5′-tctgcgctcgagttatagccagcctgctgacat-3′. PCR was performed for 35 cycles with 30 s at 94 °C, 1 min at 64 °C (or 58 °C during initial two cycles), and 12 min at 68 °C. Finally, PCR products were cloned into the pIRES2-EGFP vector using XhoI sites incorporated into primer sequences (shown in italics). Among these clones a novel splice variant pTRPγb was found, harboring a novel exon and introducing a stop codon resulting in a shorter C-terminaly truncated splice variant. Production and Specificity of pTRPγ Antibodies—Two pTRPγ antisera were raised in rabbits against the synthetic peptides (1Clapham D.E. Nature. 2003; 426: 517-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (2081) Google Scholar) QPVSGHNMSAGW and (2Minke B. Biophys. Struct. Mech. 1977; 3: 59-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) QNKSRNG representing two different C-terminal motifs. The peptides were cross-linked to keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH) by means of glutaraldehyde. The peptides, the peptide-KLH conjugates, and the antiserum (1Clapham D.E. Nature. 2003; 426: 517-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (2081) Google Scholar) were produced by Sigma Genosys (Cambridge, UK). The specificity of antiserum (1Clapham D.E. Nature. 2003; 426: 517-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (2081) Google Scholar) was tested by Western blot (Fig. 2B). For immunocytochemical control of antiserum (2Minke B. Biophys. Struct. Mech. 1977; 3: 59-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) we used the preimmune serum (Fig. 3, B and E), and we performed experiments without the primary antibody (data not shown). In both control experiments there was no staining.FIGURE 3Anti-pTRPγ immunofluorescence in the nervous system of adult Periplaneta. A–I, brain; J–L, sixth abdominal ganglion.

After electrophoretical separation of 20 μg protein per lane (SDS-PAGE) and blotting on polyvinylidene difluoride transfer membranes (Millipore), standard wash and detection procedures were used. Anti-pTRPγ antibody (1Clapham D.E. Nature. 2003; 426: 517-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (2081) Google Scholar) was 1:2000 diluted, and peroxidase-coupled secondary antibodies (anti-rabbit IgG or anti-mouse IgG) were applied in 1:10,000 dilution, followed by chemoluminescence detection with the ECL Plus kit (Amersham Biosciences). For control we used pTRPγ-transfected and mock-transfected HEK293 cells. 2 days after transfection about 1 × 105 cells were harvested and immediately lysed in 200 ml of lysis buffer, and 10 μl were used for SDS-PAGE. To exclude unspecific bands due to antibodies directed against KLH, control blots were performed with antiserum (5 μl) that was preincubated with 100 μg of KLH protein in 100 μl of phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4). This procedure prevented the Western blot detection of KLH protein by the serum but did not affect the 129 kDa signal in Periplanea tissues or in transfected HEK293 cells. Immunocytochemistry—Adult P. americana L. were taken from laboratory colonies at the University of Jena (maintained at 27 °C under a 12 h light/12 h dark regime). Animals were anesthetized by cooling under crushed ice and decapitated. Brains and the sixth abdominal ganglia were dissected from animals of both sexes under ice-chilled Tris-HCl saline and transferred into freshly prepared fixative: 4% formaldehyde in 0.1 m Millonigs buffer (pH = 7.3–7.4) overnight at room temperature. The preparations were washed in Tris-HCl buffer (146 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-OH, pH = 7.4, for 12 h at 4 °C on a shaker. 40-μm-thick sections of agar-embedded tissues were cut on a vibratome (Technical Products, St. Louis, MO). The washed free-floating vibratome sections were then incubated in rabbit anti-TRP polyclonal antibody (cf. above) diluted 1:1000 in a solution of Tris-HCl buffer containing 2% normal goat serum, 0.25% Triton-X, 3% skim milk powder, and 0.25% bovine serum albumin (MPB). Subsequently, the tissue was washed in MPB overnight and incubated in the Cy3-tagged secondary antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc., West Grove, PA) for 3 h at adilution of 1:800 in MPB. The vibratome sections were mounted and embedded in Mowiol. For the photographic documentation we used the bright-field optics on a Zeiss Axiophot microscope, a Hamamatsu digital camera C4742-95, and the software OpenLab (Improvision Ltd., Coventry, England). HEK293 cells growing on coverslips were treated as the vibratome sections. Electrophysiology—HEK293 cells were cultured at a density of ∼2 × 104 per 35-mm dish and transfected with 1 μg of pTRPγ/pIRES2-EGFP using SuperFect (Qiagen). For some experiments we transfected cells with pTRPγb/pIRES2-EGFP or with dTRPγ/pcDNA3 (a generous gift of Drs. C. Montell and L. Salkoff) and 0.8 μg pEGFP-C1 (Clontech). Ion currents in HEK293 cells and in DUM neurons (isolated according to Ref. 7Wicher D. Walther C. Penzlin H. J. Comp. Physiol. A. 1994; 174: 507-515Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) were measured at room temperature using whole-cell patch clamp with appropriate compensation of series resistance and of capacitive and leakage currents. Some experiments were performed in the inside-out configuration. Pipettes having resistances of 2–4 MΩ (HEK293 cells) or 0.5–0.8 MΩ (DUM neurons) were pulled from borosilicate capillaries. Current measurements and data acquisition were performed using an EPC9 patch clamp amplifier controlled by PULSE software (HEKA Elektronik, Lambrecht, Germany). HEK293 Cells—The pipette solution contained (in mm) 140 CsCl, 1 Mg-ATP, 10 EGTA, 10 HEPES (pH = 7.3), and the bath solution contained 140 CsCl, 15 glucose, 15 HEPES (pH = 7.4). For inside-out measurements the pipette contained the bath solution and the bath solution was exchanged by the pipette solution after establishing the seal. To evaluate the permeability of pTRPγ channel to Na+ and Ca2+ the bath solution contained 140 NaCl, 15 glucose, 15 HEPES, and 140 N-methyl-d-glucamine-Cl, 5 CaCl2, 10 glucose, 15 HEPES, respectively. The permeability ratios were calculated according to Equations 1 and 2.

Ion Channels of Excitable Membranes. Third Ed. Sinauer Associates, Sunderland, MA2001Google Scholar). To rule out an effect on endogenous HEK293 channels (12Bugaj V. Alexeenko V. Zubov A. Glushankova L. Nikolaev A. Wang Z. Kaznacheyeva E. Bezprozvanny I. Mozhayeva G.N. J. Biol.

In no case we found any significant effect indicating that all reported effects of the agents relied on the expressed TRPγ channels. On the other hand, it cannot be excluded that heterologous expression of TRP proteins in HEK293 cells may lead to the formation of new TRP heteromultimers including endogenous TRPCs (13Zagranichnaya T.K. Wu X. Villereal M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 29559-29569Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar) or to up-regulation of TRPC expression. As outlined under “Discussion,” this is rather unlikely in the case of the TRPγ proteins used in this study. DUM Neurons—The pipette solution contained (in mm) 100 choline methyl sulfate, 60 CsOH, 8 CsCl, 30 tetraethylammonium-Br, 2 Mg-ATP, 1 CaCl2, 3 EGTA, 10 HEPES, pH = 7.25. The bath solution contained 190 choline methyl sulfate, 2 CaCl2, 3 SrCl2, 10 HEPES, 0.5 μm tetrodotoxin, pH = 7.4. Background currents were measured 40 ms after stepping from holding potential of –50 mV, which corresponds to the resting potential of cells to –90 mV. Data Analysis—Results were given as means ± S.E. of mean (S.E.), n = number of cells. The evaluation of statistical significance of differences was performed with Student's t test. For data analysis the software IgorPro (WaveMetrics, Lake Oswego, OR) and Prism 4 (Graph Pad Software, San Diego, CA) were used. Sequence Analysis of P. americana TRPγ—Using a combined degenerated PCR and RACE protocol, we were able to isolate the full-length sequence of the P. americana pTRPγ channel. The 3585-bp cDNA sequence (GenBank™ accession number AY387857) is coding for a protein of 1154 amino acids showing all typical features of a TRP-like channel: four ankyrin-like repeats at the N terminus, a coiled-coil domain, six transmembrane regions, a TRP-pore sequence typical for a nonspecific cation channel, and a long C terminus harboring several conserved TRP-specific sequences. The pTRPγ sequence is 66% identical and 75% homologous to the orthologous D. melanogaster sequence (dTRPγ), whereas sequence similarity to paralogous Drosophila sequences (dTRP and dTRPL) is significantly lower and spans only the very conserved core region of ∼900 amino acids of the protein, with ∼50% identity and 65% similarity. An alignment of pTRPγ and dTRPγ indicating several conserved protein features is shown in Fig. 1. The C terminus is less conserved between Periplaneta and Drosophila TRPγ as seen in various gaps in the alignment and in a C-terminal extension of pTRPγ. A comparison with the Drosophila genomic sequence (3Xu X.Z. Chien F. Butler A. Salkoff L. Montell C. Neuron. 2000; 26: 647-657Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar) indicated that alternative splicing only in one case might be responsible for these variations, i.e. the pTRPγ sequence lacked one dTRPγ exon (indicated in Fig. 1). In addition, when amplifying the full-length pTRPγ sequence, a short alternatively spliced variant, pTRPγb, was discovered. This splice variant harbored the homologous dTRPγ exon missing in the full-length form, but it introduced a stop codon thereafter, resulting in a truncated pTRPγ version with only 791 amino acids, i.e. lacking most of the C-terminal sequence. In addition, a short variable region was identified in the C terminus, resulting in either deletion of a single amino acid (alanine 827) or in an expansion by four residues (GNTS) preceding alanine 827. The mechanism of this sequence variation is unclear but may represent alternative usage of exon-intron splice sites or polymorphisms. Expression Analysis of pTRPγ—The expression of pTRPγ channels in neuronal tissue was tested by a nested RT-PCR approach. An intron-spanning 355-bp PCR fragment was amplified from Periplaneta brain as well as from all thoracic and abdominal ganglia indicating a widespread expression in cockroach neuronal tissue. In addition, in four out of ten investigated DUM neurons a pTRPγ signal was found on single-cell level as well (Fig. 2A). A Western blot analysis of neuronal tissues showed a distinct band with the expected molecular mass of 129 kDa in abdominal and thoracic ganglia with very low background staining (Fig. 2B). A protein of the same size was detected by the same antiserum (1Clapham D.E. Nature. 2003; 426: 517-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (2081) Google Scholar) in transiently transfected HEK293 cells expressing pTRPγ but not in mock-transfected cells. Distribution of pTRPγ in the Nervous System—Control immunostainings were performed with both pTRPγ antibodies in HEK293 cells transfected with pTRPγ DNA. 24 h after transfection, HEK293 cells showed significant immunofluorescence (Fig. 2, C and E), which was missing in non-transfected cells (Fig. 2, D and F). Immunostainings within the Periplaneta nervous system revealed a frequent but distinct expression of pTRPγ both in brain (Fig. 3, A–H) and abdominal ganglia (Fig. 3, J–L). Both antibodies, which were designed to recognize different C-terminal pTRPγ motifs, were seen to stain the same structures (Fig. 3, A, C, D, and F). Generally less intense immunofluorescence was seen in neuronal somata ranging from virtually absent to clearly pronounced staining as shown in Fig. 3, J and K, for the DUM neurons. Within the brain, immunostaining was found in the protocerebrum, in the deutocerebrum, and in the optic lobes. In the protocerebrum longitudinal and commissural fibers are stained. Within the central complex there is strong immunoreactivity in fibers around the upper (Fig. 3, D and F) and the lower (Fig. 3D) part of central body. Interestingly, the arborization areas within the central body do not show any immunoreactivity. This might indicate that pTRPγ is expressed in fibers exept for their terminal branches including synaptic areas (Fig. 3, D and F). Similarly, there was clear staining around the olfactory glomeruli in the antennal lobe but not at all within the glomeruli where olfactory signals are processed via manifold synaptic contacts (Fig. 3G). The antennocerebral tract containing the projection neuron fibers was extensively stained (Fig. 3H). Besides the regions of olfactory information processing there is prominent staining in the optic lobes, particularly within the medulla (Fig. 3I). In the abdominal ganglia the somata of DUM neurons (Fig. 3, J and K) and those of a few smaller, not identified neurons (data not shown) appear stained. As in the brain, some fiber tracts are prominently stained while others such as the giant axons lack any staining (Fig. 3, J and L). cAMP Down-regulates pTRPγ but Not dTRPγ Currents—Expression of pTRPγ in HEK293 cells produced a constitutively active non-selective cation conductance, which was not found in mock-transfected cells. The pTRPγ current showed outward rectification, even with symmetrical ion concentrations (Fig. 4, A and B). The ratio of ion permeabilities was estimated from the dependence of the reversal potential on the composition of bath versus pipette solutions. With 5 mm Ca2+ and 140 mm Na+ in the bath versus 140 mm Cs+ in the pipette the reversal potential was –16.0 ± 0.9 mV (n = 5) and –0.4 ± 1.1 mV (n = 6), respectively. This yields, according to Equations 1 and 2, a permeability ratio of PNa:PCs:PCa = 1:1.01:2.05, which is very similar to the corresponding ratio reported for dTRPγ (3Xu X.Z. Chien F. Butler A. Salkoff L. Montell C. Neuron. 2000; 26: 647-657Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). HEK293 cells expressing pTRPγ were thus exposed to sustained influx of ions including Ca2+ and showed considerably shortened survival time in culture compared with mock-transfected cells. 24 h after transfection the ratio of green fluorescing cells to non-fluorescing cells was 0.19 ± 0.08 (n = 200). Among the cells expressing pTRPγ the morphology of 26 ± 7(n = 38) cells was typical for HEK293 cells; the remaining cells appeared spherical. 48 h after transfection only 9 ± 3% of cells (n = 200) showed green fluorescence, and all these cells were of spherical shape. With the given sustained Ca2+ permeability of pTRPγ in the heterologous expression system this channel meets one of the criteria for a channel involved in NCCE in DUM neurons. The most intriguing question was whether pTRPγ would be inhibited by cAMP. To test this we used symmetric Cs+ solution to avoid Ca2+ overload of cells. Application of the membrane-permeant cAMP analog 8-Br-cAMP (2 μm) caused a significant reduction of the pTRPγ current but no total block, since application of the TRP channel blocker 2-APB (100 μm) in the presence of 8-Br-cAMP blocked the remaining current nearly completely (Fig. 4, A and C). The fraction of current resistant to 8-Br-cAMP was 0.63 ± 0.06 at –100 mV and 0.67 ± 0.04 at +100 mV (n = 16), i.e. the 8-Br-cAMP effect was not apparently voltage-dependent. The 8-Br-cAMP-induced inhibition of the pTRPγ current started to develop within the first minute after application and saturated within a couple of minutes (Fig. 4B). After removal of 8-Br-cAMP the current recovered within 3–5 min (Fig. 6A). Taken together, 8-Br-cAMP seemed to act like a channel blocker. To support this more directly we performed experiments in the inside-out configuration. Bath application of cAMP again reduced the current, but even at a concentration of 1 mm more than 50% of current was resistant to cAMP (Fig. 4D). The dose-response curve of the cAMP effect shown in Fig. 4E is characterized by an IC50 of 74 nm and a Hill coefficient of 0.83. At ["

The interaction domains have been speculated to be the β-sheets, each of which is formed by two or more β-strands. βB2-crystallin consists of 16 β-strands, 8 in the N-terminal domain and 8 in the C-terminal domain. Domain interaction sites may be removed by destroying the β-strands, which can be done by site-specific mutations, substituting the β-formers (Val, Phe, Leu) with Glu or Asn, strong β-breakers. We have cloned the following β-strand-deleted mutants, I20E, L34E, V54E, V60E, V73E, L97E, I109E, I124E, V144E, V152E, L162E, L165E, and V187E and their corresponding X → Asn mutants. We also made two mutants, V46E and V129E, that were not on the β-strand as controls. Disruption of protein-protein interactions was screened by a mammalian two-hybrid system assay. Protein-protein interactions decreased for all β-strand-deleted mutants except I20E, L34E, and L162E mutants; this effect was not seen in the two mutant controls, V46E and V129E. The sequences around Val-54, Val-60, Val-73, and Leu-97 in the N-terminal region and Ile-109, Ile-124, Val-144, Val-152, Leu-165, and Val-187 in the C-terminal region that formed β-strands appear to be important in dimerization. Some selected mutant proteins that showed strong (V46E and V129E) and reduced (V60E, V144E, V60N, and V144N) interactions were expressed in bacterial culture and were studied with spectroscopy and chromatography. The V60E and V144E mutants were found to be partially unfolded and incapable of forming a complete dimer. βB2-crystallin, the major component of β-crystallin, is a dimer at low concentrations but can form oligomers under physiological conditions.

Ma Z. Shih M. Shearer T.R. Smith J.B. Smith D.L. David L.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2268-2275Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar, 2Fu L. Liang J.J. Mol.

At high concentrations or in the lens, βB2-crystallin forms hetero-oligomers with other β-crystallins. These oligomeric β-crystallins further participate in the formation of a supramolecular assembly that is important in lens function-lens transparency. A posttranslational or mutational modification in the interaction domain will disrupt the complex formation and the supramolecular assembly. Therefore, the determination of the interaction domains is essential for understanding crystallin functions. For a dimer or oligomeric proteins, the interaction sites or domains are usually β-sheets formed by two or more β-strands. βB2-crystallin was reported to have a high β-sheet content (2Fu L. Liang J.J. Mol. Vis. 2001; 7: 178-183PubMed Google Scholar). Based on the structure from x-ray refraction studies for homodimer βB2-crystallin (4Driessen H.P. Bax B. Slingsby C. Lindley P.F.

Mahadevan D. Blundell T.L. Slingsby C. Nature. 1990; 347: 776-780Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar), each subunit includes 16 β-strands. Table 1 gives the distribution of those 16 β-strands along with that predicted from the PHD method (6Rost B. Sander C. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 232: 584-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (2655) Google Scholar). The distribution for γB-crystallin is also included for comparison (7Kumaraswamy V.S. Lindley P.F. Slingsby C. Glover I.D. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1996; 52: 611-622Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Each subunit has four Greek key motifs, and each motif contains four β-strands. Using site-specific mutation and a two-hybrid system assay, one can determine which β-strands are involved in the dimerization. It has been reported, based on x-ray structures of 29 proteins (8Chou P.Y. Fasman G.D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1978; 47: 251-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (2339) Google Scholar, 9Chou P. Fasman G.D. Prediction of Protein Structure and the Principles of Protein Conformation. Plenum Press, New York1989: 549-586Crossref Google Scholar), that amino acids such as Val and Ile are strong β-formers and Leu and Phe are β-formers but that Glu and Pro are strong β-breakers and Asn, Lys, and Asp are β-breakers. Using site-specific mutation, one can eliminate the β-strands that are responsible for dimerization. We have prepared many X (Val or Ile or Leu) → Glu or Asn mutants for the two-hybrid system screening assays (Table 2) and found that most β-strand-deleted mutants, especially those in the C-terminal domain, have reduced protein interactions. The results are consistent with our recent study of the Q155* βB2-crystallin mutant (10Liu B.F. Liang J.J. Mol. Vis. 2005; 11: 321-327PubMed Google Scholar); the Q155* mutation decreased protein-protein interactions (dimerization), and the expressed mutant protein became partially unfolded. The truncation of 51 amino acid residues in the C-terminal region removes three β-strands that participate in intermolecular domain interactions. To study the effects of the β-strand-deleted mutations on biophysical properties, we cloned two such mutants (V60E or V60N and V144E or V144N) and two controls (V46E and V129E) and observed that β-strand-deleted mutant genes resulted in conformational change (partial unfolding) and inability to form complete dimers.TABLE 1Sequence alignment and distribution of β-strand of β B2- and γ B-crystallinN-terminal extension111βB2aThe prediction from PHD program by Rost and Sander (6) for the wild-type human lens βB2-crystallin.

The primers used were custom synthesized (Invitrogen) (Table 2). The corresponding mutants of X → Asn substitution were also prepared. Cotransfection and SEAP Assay—HeLa cells were used in the cell culture, and Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) was used in cotransfection as previously reported (10Liu B.F. Liang J.J. Mol. Vis. 2005; 11: 321-327PubMed Google Scholar, 11Fu L. Liang J.J. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2003; 44: 1155-1159Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 12Fu L. Liang J.J. J. Biol.

HeLa cells were grown at 37 °C with 5% CO2 with 10% serum and were seeded at 2 × 105 cells in 500 μl of medium/well in a 24-well plate. Plasmids pM-X (0.3 μg) and pVP16-Y (0.3 μg) and pG5SEAP reporter vector (0.3 μg) were added to the wells containing 2 μl of Lipofectamine 2000 reagent. SEAP activity was detected 48 h after transfection using the BD Great EscAPe SEAP fluorescence detection kit (Clontech). The detailed protocol for SEAP detection is provided in the kit and was used in our recently reported study (10Liu B.F. Liang J.J. Mol. Vis. 2005; 11: 321-327PubMed Google Scholar). The fluorescence substrate MUP (4-methylumbelliferyl phosphate) provides an easy assay of SEAP by reading fluorescence at 360/449 nm. A standard linear curve was obtained using the positive placental alkaline phosphatase. The expression of GAL4 DNA-BD/protein fusion was verified by Western blot with the GAL4 DNA-BD monoclonal antibody (11Fu L. Liang J.J. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis.

To see whether expression levels were a factor for different SEAP activities, protein concentrations in the soluble protein extracts were determined using the Pierce BCA assay. The results indicated that protein expression levels varied very little among the various culture cells. Expression of βB2-Crystallin Mutants—The use of the QIAexpression Type IV kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) in the cloning, expression, and purification of His6-tagged βB2-crystallin has been described elsewhere (10Liu B.F. Liang J.J. Mol. Vis. 2005; 11: 321-327PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, the βB2-crystallin mutant genes in pM plasmids (e.g. pM-βB2WT) were amplified by PCR using Pfu DNA polymerase (Stratagene) with the forward/reverse primers: CGGGGTACCCCGGCCTCAGATCACCAG/CCCAAGCTTGGGGTTGGAGGGGTGGAA. Two restriction sites, KpnI and HindIII, were included in the primers. The PCR products and pQE-30 vector were doubly digested by KpnI and HindIII. The digested genes and vector were then ligated by DNA ligase under standard conditions. The βB2 cDNA inserts were verified by sequencing analysis. The expression constructs containing various βB2-crystallin genes were transformed into Escherichia coli strain M15 (pREP4). Cell culture was performed to induce expression of various proteins by a standard protocol. The His6-tagged βB2-crystallins, either wild-type or mutant, were purified by nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid affinity chromatography. SDS-PAGE and Immunoblotting—SDS-PAGE was performed in a slab gel (15% acrylamide) under reducing conditions according to the method of Laemmli (13Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207516) Google Scholar). Western blotting was performed with polyclonal anti-β-crystallin antibodies (a gift from Sam Zigler of NEI/National Institutes of Health). Protein concentrations were determined by measuring absorption at 280 nm: A0.1% = 1.74 for both WT and mutant βB2-crystallins (14Mach H. Middaugh C.R. Lewis R.V. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 200: 74-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar). FPLC Gel Filtration—Size-exclusion chromatography was carried out in fast protein liquid chromatography (FPLC) with a Superose-12 column. Spectroscopic Studies—CD spectra were obtained with an Aviv circular dichroism spectrometer (model 60 DS; Aviv Associates, Lakewood, NJ). Five scans were recorded and averaged and followed by a polynomial-fitting program. The CD was expressed as deg-cm2-dmol-1. Fluorescence was measured with a Shimadzu spectrofluorometer (model RF-5301PC; Shimadzu Instruments, Columbia, MD). Trp emission was scanned with an excitation wavelength at 295 nm. Bis-ANS fluorescence emission spectra were scanned between 460 and 560 nm with an excitation wavelength of 395 nm. Protein-Protein Interactions Involving βB2-Crystallin Mutants—The SEAP activities as detected by 4-methylumbelliferyl phosphate fluorescence between βB2-crystallin mutants themselves are shown in Fig. 1. The majority of the mutations in the β-strands, including V54E, V60E, V73E, L97E, L109E, I124E, V144E, V152E, L165E, and V187E, decreased SEAP activities relative to the wild-type βB2-crystallin. The mutations that did not decrease SEAP activities included I20E, L34E, V46E, V129E, and L162E. In general, mutations in the C-terminal region reduced SEAP activity more than did those in the N-terminal region. The two control mutations, V46E and V129E, which are not in the β-strand, did not decrease the SEAP activity. These results indicated that disruption of particular β-strands that might participate in dimerization was responsible for the reduction of SEAP activity. Those mutations that resulted in low SEAP activities between themselves (e.g. V54E-V54E) also showed low SEAP activities with WT (e.g. V54E-WT) (Fig. 2).FIGURE 2The corresponding protein-protein interactions between β-strand-deleted βB2-crystallin mutants and WT βB2-crystallin: N-terminal region (A) and C-terminal region (B). Significant decreases were observed for the mutants from WT (*, p <0.05 in panel A and p <0.005 in panel B).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The corresponding SEAP activities for the mutants with an X → Asn substitution are shown in Fig. 3. The results are basically the same as those of mutants of X → Glu substitution, indicating that substitution of either the charged glutamic acid or the neutral asparagines yielded the same result. Biophysical Studies of βB2-Crystallin Mutants—Four βB2-crystallin mutants with a Val → Glu substitution (V46E, V54E, V129E, and V144E), two in the N- and two in the C-terminal region, as well as WT were prepared as His6-tagged proteins. The two mutants V46E and V129E did not involve destruction of β-strands, and the two mutants V54E and 144E did involve destruction of β-strands. The His6 tagging did not change protein conformation, as the His6-tagged WT βB2-crystallin did not show any difference in Trp fluorescence and CD from non-His-tagged WT βB2-crystallin (10Liu B.F. Liang J.J. Mol. Vis. 2005; 11: 321-327PubMed Google Scholar). For mutation of Val → Asn substitution, V60N and V144N mutants were prepared. SDS-PAGE, Western Blot, and FPLC Size-exclusion Chromatography—SDS-PAGE and Western blot are shown in Fig. 4. The His6-tagged βB2-crystallin is located at a higher molecular weight than the non-tagged βB2-crystallin. The elution profiles of the V46E and V129E mutants on FPLC are the same as that of the WT, but those of V60E and V144E mutants appeared to contain a mixture of dimers and monomers (Fig. 5). A rerun of collected fractions between 18 and 21 ml for V144E mutant showed the same profile. The corresponding mutants V60N and V144N did not show the effect. CD and Fluorescence—Both far-UV and near-UV CD changed greatly for the V60E and V144E mutants (Figs. 6 and 7), indicating an alteration occurs not only in the secondary structure but also the tertiary structure. The change is similar for the two mutants, but the other two control mutants, V46E and V129E, did not show these changes. The CD data indicate that the mutations (Val → Glu) involving the addition of charge change CD more than those mutations (Val → Asn) involving no change of charge.FIGURE 7Near-UV CD of β-strand-deleted βB2-crystallin mutants: V46E and V60E mutations in the N-terminal region (A), V129E and V144E mutations in the C-terminal region (B), and V60N and V144N mutations (C). WT βB2-crystallin is included for comparison. Protein concentrations are 0.5 mg/ml, and the cell path length is 10 mm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Trp and Bis-ANS Fluorescence—Trp fluorescence showed no shift in emission maximal wavelength and only a small change in intensity for V46E and V129E mutants but a large red shift (from 331 to 345 nm) for V60E and V144E or V60N and V144N mutants (Fig. 8), suggesting that Trp residues in these mutants are in a more hydrophilic environment than are those in V46E, V129E, and WT. In comparison with αA-crystallin, WT βB2-crystallin gave a relatively low bis-ANS fluorescence intensity (2Fu L. Liang J.J. Mol. Vis. 2001; 7: 178-183PubMed Google Scholar), but the intensity increased greatly for the V60E and V144E or V609N and V144N mutants (Fig. 9), indicating that the buried hydrophobic surfaces became accessible to the bis-ANS probe in these mutants. The crystallographic structure of βB2-crystallin has been determined for a homodimer of a fragment of a 181-amino acid sequence without the N- and C-terminal extensions (5Bax B. Lapatto R. Nalini V. Driessen H. Lindley P.F. Mahadevan D. Blundell T.L. Slingsby C. Nature. 1990; 347: 776-780Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar, 15Bax B. Slingsby C. J. Mol. Biol. 1989; 208: 715-717Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) and a tetrameric WT (16Nalini V. Bax B. Driessen H. Moss D.S. Lindley P.F. Slingsby C. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 236: 1250-1258Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The distribution of the β-strand in each subunit is different in dimers and tetramers. For the purpose of our study, the use of the crystallographic structure of homodimer βB2-crystallin should be adequate. Both the dimer and tetramer structures were determined with bovine lens βB2-crystallin. Because we used human lens βB2-crystallin, we used a PHD program to predict the secondary structure (6Rost B. Sander C. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 232: 584-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (2655) Google Scholar). The predicted secondary structure is in good agreement with that from crystallography (Table 1). It is reasonable to assume that the structure of human βB2-crystallin is similar to that of bovine βB2-crystallin, because they share a high sequence homology (91%). We also included the distribution of β-strands for γB-crystallin for comparison because the structures of βB2- and γB-crystallin are similar. Both βB2- and γB-crystallin structures are characterized by having four Greek key motifs: two (1 and 2) in the N-terminal domain and two (3 and 4) in the C-terminal domain (5Bax B. Lapatto R. Nalini V. Driessen H. Lindley P.F. Mahadevan D. Blundell T.L. Slingsby C. Nature. 1990; 347: 776-780Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar, 7Kumaraswamy V.S. Lindley P.F. Slingsby C. Glover I.D. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1996; 52: 611-622Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Each motif consists of four β-strands, and four motifs form four β-sheets. Each β-sheet contains four β-strands that do not correspond exactly to those in the particular motif. The β1-sheet consists of three β-strands in motif-1 (β1-, β2-, and β4-) and one β-strand in motif-2 (β7-). The corresponding β-strands in the other three β-sheets are: β2-sheet (β3-, β5-, β6-, and β8-), β3-sheet (β9-, β10-, β12-, and β15-), and β4-sheet (β11-, β13-, β14-, and β16-). In γB-crystallin, the two domains are connected by a flexible linker peptide and organized so that two β-sheets (sheet-1 and sheet-3) lie on the outside of the molecule and the other two (sheet-2 and sheet-4) are in partial contact (intramolecular domain association). βB2-crystallin has a structure similar to that of γ-crystallin except that the linker peptide is extended in a way favoring an intermolecular association; the two subunits associate in a dimer in a swap form such that the N-terminal domain of the first subunit is adjacent to the C-terminal domain of the second subunit. The other major difference is that βB2-crystallin contains an N-extension and a C-extension, reported to be responsible for preventing oligomerization (association of dimers) (17Trinkl S. Glockshuber R. Jaenicke R. Protein Sci. 1994; 3: 1392-1400Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 18Sergeev Y.V. Hejtmancik J.F. Wingfield P.T. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 415-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Domain interactions in the βB2-crystallin may be similar to those in the γB-crystallin, i.e. between sheet-2 of the first subunit and sheet-4 of the second subunit and between sheet-4 of the first subunit and sheet-2 of the second subunit. The sheet-2 consists of the β3-, β5-, β6-, and β8-strand in the N-terminal region of the first subunit, and the sheet-4 consists of the β11-, β13-, β14-, and β16-strand in the C-terminal region of the second subunit. The mutations in Val-60, Val-73, Leu-97 destroyed β5-, β6-, and β8-strands located in motif-2, and the mutations in Val-152, Leu-165, and Val-187 destroyed β13-, β14-, and β16-strands located in the motif-4. The destruction of β-strand was reflected in the large reduction in SEAP activity. The results of mutations at β2- and β4-sheets confirm that they play an important role in dimerization. However, the results of some mutations in β1- and β3-sheets were mixed: mutation in Val-54, Ile-109, Ile-124, and Val-144 decreased SEAP activities and in Ile-20 and Leu-34 did not decrease SEAP activities. The mutation sites of Val-46 and Val-129 are not in the β-strand, and the SEAP activities were not affected. Apparently, the association of the β2-sheet of the first subunit and the β4-sheet of the second subunit was not entirely responsible for the dimerization. The Val → Glu substitution introduced a negative charge; we made some Val → Asn substitutions to see whether the decrease of SEAP activity might be due to the introduction of the charge and found that the changes in SEAP activities were basically the same as that of mutants with the X → Glu substitution. The disruption of key β-strands is the critical mechanism for the decrease of SEAP activity. The observation that V60E (V60N) and V144E (V144N) mutations greatly reduced SEAP activity indicated that the β5- and β12-strands were two of the many dimerization sites, which was further confirmed by their inability to form complete dimers. The control mutants V46E and V129E, in which mutations were in the non-β-strand, did not show these effects. The partial unfolding in the V144E mutant was also seen in the V144N mutant, indicating that disruption of the β-strand by either a Val → Glu or a Val → Asn substitution gave the same result. As dimerization is the initial step in the formation of β-crystallin complexes seen in the human lens, to maintain the integrity of the subunit interaction domains is thus important in sustaining their stability. Any disruption of the domain structures by either posttranslational modification or mutation will disturb the complex formation that is critical for lens transparency. This was demonstrated in the congenital cataract CRYBB2 gene product Q155*, in which 51 amino acid residues were truncated, removing all β-strands in the motif-4 critical in dimerization and resulting in a partially unfolded and unstable protein (10Liu B.F. Liang J.J. Mol. Vis. 2005; 11: 321-327PubMed Google Scholar). We believe that these events are primary effects and that the secondary effect is an inability of the protein to participate in complex formation. The determination of the dimerization domain is thus important not only for βB2-crystallin but also for αA- and αB-crystallin, whose three-dimensional structures have not been established. It is possible to obtain data about dimerization domains similar to those of βB2-crystallin by extending the present study to α-crystallin, with its β-strand distribution predicted by the PHD program. The sites of both R116C αA-crystallin and R120G αB-crystallin mutations, associated with various autosomal dominant congenital cataracts, are located in the β7-strand and were found to change protein-protein interactions profoundly (11Fu L. Liang J.J. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2003; 44: 1155-1159Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), although the mechanism might not be related to disruption of the β-strand. Two recent studies reported the interaction domains for αB-crystallin, with their results not in complete agreement; one used a peptide scan (19Sreelakshmi Y. Santhoshkumar P. Bhattacharyya J. Sharma K.K. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 15785-15795Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), and the other used a protein pin array (20Ghosh J.G. Clark J.I. Protein Sci. 2005; 14: 684-695Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The latter report indicates that interaction domains are accessible to solvent and consist primarily of β-strands in the core region with a minor helical structure in the N-terminal region and a nonstructural sequence in the C-terminal region. An earlier study using site-directed spin labeling identified an interface consisting of two β-sheets of seven β-strands at α-crystallin domain that mediates the formation of dimeric αA-crystallin (21Koteiche H.A. McHaourab H.S. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 294: 561-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). The other relevant study was reported by J. King and coworkers (22Kosinski-Collins M.S. Flaugh S.L. King J. Protein Sci. 2004; 13: 2223-2235Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) on human γD-crystallin. Using site-specific mutagenesis on γD-crystallin and an unfolding-refolding study, they found that some hydrophobic residues (Phe-56, Ile-81, Val-132, and Leu-145) are important in the domain interactions and they are in the β-strands that contribute to intra-domain interactions. In summary, we have demonstrated that the two-hybrid system could be used to determine the subunit interaction domains for βB2-crystallin. Our studies confirm the key β-strands that play an important role in the dimerization."

Here, we have developed a series of analogues of the 27-amino acid hormone, secretin, that incorporate a fluorescent Alexa Fluor 488 into the amino terminus, the carboxyl terminus, and positions 13 and 22. Each probe bound with high affinity and was biologically active, stimulating full cAMP responses in receptor-bearing Chinese hamster ovary-SecR cells. Treatment with 10 μm guanosine 5′-(β,γ-imido)triphosphate (GppNHp) shifted the agonist-bound receptor into a G protein-uncoupled low affinity state. Fluorescence spectra for the probes in solution and bound to the receptor demonstrated maximal emission at 521 nm after excitation at 481 nm. Collisional quenching of fluorescence with potassium iodide revealed that Alexa at the amino terminus of secretin was more accessible than at the other three positions within the probes. Of note, quenching constants for each probe were higher when bound in the active state than in the G protein-uncoupled, low affinity state of the receptor, with the most marked changes occurring for the two midregion probes. Anisotropy values and fluorescence lifetimes confirmed this, with higher anisotropy and longer lifetimes observed for position 13 and 22 probes bound to the receptor in its uncoupled state than in its active state. These observations suggest that the amino terminus of secretin as docked to the receptor is most exposed to the hydrophilic aqueous milieu, and that the major changes in conformation and exposure to the medium occur in the midregion of secretin. Photoaffinity labeling studies have demonstrated approximation of each of these ligand residues with distinct receptor residues.

Understanding the molecular basis of ligand binding and receptor activation are critical to facilitate the design and development of drugs acting at these targets. Extensive studies have been performed to gain such insights for the largest family of G protein-coupled receptors, the A Family, which includes rhodopsin and the β-adrenergic receptor (1Palczewski K. Kumasaka T. Hori T. Behnke C.A. Motoshima H. Fox B.A. Le Trong I. Teller D.C. Okada T. Stenkamp R.E. Yamamoto M. Miyano M.

However, such insights are less well developed for the B Family of receptors within this superfamily. This group of receptors includes several potentially important drug targets, such as receptors for parathyroid hormone, calcitonin, glucagon, secretin, and vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (3Laburthe M.

The B Family of G protein-coupled receptors shares the general heptahelical transmembrane topology with Family A receptors, but lacks the typical sequence signatures of that group of receptors and possesses a characteristic long, disulfide-bonded amino-terminal region known to be critical for peptide ligand binding and activation (6Holtmann M.H.

Chem. 1996; 271: 14944-14949Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar).We are interested in studying the molecular basis of natural ligand binding to the secretin receptor, a prototypic member of the B Family of G protein-coupled receptors (7Donnelly D. FEBS Lett. 1997; 409: 431-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 8Ishihara T. Nakamura S. Kaziro Y. Takahashi T. Takahashi K. Nagata S. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 1635-1641Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar). The natural ligand for this receptor is a linear 27-amino acid peptide having a diffuse pharmacophoric domain. All the receptors in the B Family have similarly large natural peptide ligands. The secretin receptor has its major physiologic functions to stimulate bicarbonate-rich secretion from the biliary and pancreatic ductular tree and the inhibition of gastric emptying (4Dong M. Miller L.J. Recept. Channels. 2002; 8: 189-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 9Ulrich 2nd, C.D. Holtmann M. Miller L.J.

Of note, all but one of these probes covalently labeled residues within the critically important amino-terminal region of this receptor, with only the amino-terminal probe labeling the body of the receptor above transmembrane segment six. Using these constraints and those provided by three intradomain disulfide bonds in this region that have been established (17Asmann Y.W. Dong M. Ganguli S. Hadac E.M. Miller L.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 58: 911-919Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 18Lisenbee C.S. Dong M. Miller L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 12330-12338Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), we have been able to propose a preliminary molecular model for the secretin-bound receptor (12Dong M. Li Z. Zang M. Pinon D.I. Lybrand T.P. Miller L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 48300-48312Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar).In the current work, we have extended these insights by utilizing biophysical fluorescence techniques. These provide the opportunity to probe the environment of the receptor-bound peptide ligand while independently modifying the conformational state of the receptor. Unlike the static insights provided by affinity labeling using agonist probes, this provides insight into dynamic changes in receptor conformation associated with receptor activation. This approach has previously been applied to the Family A G protein-coupled receptors, including rhodopsin, the β-adrenergic receptor, and the cholecystokinin receptor (19Altenbach C.

Pharmacol. 2004; 65: 28-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), however, it has not yet been applied to any other member of the Family B receptors.For this work, we have developed a series of four fluorescent probes, representing analogues of natural secretin in which Alexa Fluor 488 was incorporated into the amino terminus, carboxyl terminus, and two positions within the midregion of the peptide (positions 13 and 22). The binding and biological activities of these probes were characterized in secretin receptor-expressing Chinese hamster ovary (CHO)-SecR cells. We measured the fluorescence emission spectra, potassium iodide quenching, anisotropy, and lifetimes of these probes bound to the secretin receptor in both active and G protein-uncoupled conformations, manipulated using GppNHp, a non-hydrolysable analogue of GTP.Indeed, all four probes were able to bind to the secretin receptor with high affinity and specificity, and they exhibited full agonist activity in stimulating cAMP responses. GppNHp was shown to effectively shift the agonist-bound active state of this receptor into its G protein-uncoupled low affinity state. Each the probes exhibited moderate anisotropy and rotational freedom of motion, which was temperature-dependent. The two probes in which Alexa was incorporated into positions Lys13 and Lys22 of secretin exhibited lower anisotropy and shorter average lifetimes with the receptor in its active conformation than in its G protein-uncoupled conformation. Consistent with these observations, the Alexa fluorescence of these probes was more easily quenched by potassium iodide with the receptor in the active conformation. Of interest, the environments of both the amino-terminal and carboxyl-terminal probes were less affected by shifting the conformation of the receptor, although the trends were similar to those of the midregion probes.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—Alexa Fluor 488-N-hydroxysuccinimide ester was from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). N-(9-Fluorenyl)-methoxycarbonyl (Fmoc)-amino acids were from Nova Biochem (San Diego, CA). Bacitracin, GppNHp, hexadimethrine bromide (Polybrene), and 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthanine were from Sigma. Fetal clone 2 medium additive was from Hyclone Laboratories (Logan, UT). Ham's F-12 medium was from Invitrogen.

Peptides were synthesized manually on solid-phase, as we previously described (22Ulrich 2nd, C.D. Pinon D.I. Hadac E.M. Holicky E.L. Chang-Miller A. Gates L.K. Miller L.J.

The fluorescent analogues were then prepared by derivatizing single free amino groups with an N-hydroxysuccinimide ester of Alexa Fluor 488 in solution. Probes were purified to homogeneity by reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography and had their identities confirmed by mass spectrometry, as we have previously described (9Ulrich 2nd, C.D.

This cell line was previously characterized as expressing receptor that binds secretin and elicits cAMP responses similar to wild type receptor expressed naturally (22Ulrich 2nd, C.D. Pinon D.I.

The cells were grown in tissue culture flasks containing Ham's F-12 medium supplemented with 5% fetal clone II in a temperature-controlled humidified incubator, maintained in an environment containing 5% CO2. The cells were passaged twice per week and dislodged mechanically to harvest for cell membrane preparation.Plasma Membrane Preparation—Receptor-enriched plasma membrane-containing fraction was isolated by discontinuous density gradient centrifugation, as described previously (24Harikumar K.G. Pinon D.I. Wessels W.S. Prendergast F.G. Miller L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 18552-18560Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). In short, the semiconfluent CHO-SecR cells were dislodged by mechanical means and harvested in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline containing 1.47 mm NaH2PO4, 8.2 mm Na2HPO4, pH 7.0, and 145 mm NaCl. After centrifugation, the cell pellet was suspended in 0.3 m sucrose containing 0.01% soybean trypsin inhibitor (w/v) and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and homogenized by sonication in a Sonifier Cell Distrupter (Heat Systems-Ultrasonics, Inc., Plainview, NY) for 10 s at a setting of 7. The sucrose concentration of the homogenate was adjusted to 1.3 m, placed at the bottom of a tube, and overlaid with 0.3 m sucrose before centrifugation at 225,000 × g for 1 h at 4°C.The receptor-containing fraction was harvested from the sucrose interface, diluted with ice-cold water, and concentrated in the pellet by centrifugation at 225,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. Pellets were then re-suspended in Krebs-Ringers-HEPES (KRH) buffer (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 104 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 2 mm CaCl2, 1mm KH2PO4, 1.2 mm MgSO4) containing 0.01% soybean trypsin inhibitor, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and were stored at–80 °C until ready for use.Receptor Binding Assays—The functional characteristics of each of the fluorescent probes were determined by performing radioligand competition-binding assays, as described previously (25Harikumar K.G. Clain J. Pinon D.I. Dong M. Miller L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 1044-1050Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). In short, membranes isolated from CHO-SecR cells (15–20 μg of membrane protein per tube) were mixed with 2–5 pm radioligand (∼20,000 cpm of [125I-Tyr10]secretin) in the absence or presence of increasing concentrations of non-radioactive fluorescent peptides in KRH buffer, pH 7.4, containing 0.2% bovine serum albumin (w/v), 0.01% soybean trypsin inhibitor (w/v), and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Tubes were then incubated at 25 °C for 1 h to achieve steady-state binding. The receptor-bound radioligand was separated from free radioligand using a Skatron cell harvester (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA) with 0.3% Polybrene-soaked receptor-binding filtermats. Bound radioactivity was quantified with a γ-spectrometer. Data were analyzed using the LIGAND program of Munson and Rodbard (26Munson P.J. Rodbard D. Anal. Biochem. 1980; 107: 220-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (7760) Google Scholar), and graphed using the nonlinear least-squares curve-fitting routine in the Prism program by GraphPad (San Diego, CA). Guanyl nucleotide sensitivity was measured by performing receptor binding assays in the absence and presence of 10 μm GppNHp, a non-hydrolyzable analogue of GTP.Studies of fluorescent ligand dissociation were performed in an analogous manner to that previously reported with radioiodinated receptor ligands (21Harikumar K.G. Pinon D.I. Wessels W.S. Dawson E.S. Lybrand T.P. Prendergast F.G. Miller L.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 2004; 65: 28-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Fluorescence intensities in membrane fractions were acquired using the SPEX Fluoromax-3 spectrofluorometer using constant wavelength analysis mode (excitation 481 nm, emission 521 nm) and integration time of 10 s. Non-saturable binding was determined by quantifying fluorescence intensities in the assay conditions when binding of the fluorescent ligand was performed in the presence of 1 μm secretin, with this representing less than 10% of total bound fluorescent ligand.Biological Activity Assays—Each of the fluorescent probes employed in this study was characterized by monitoring its ability to elicit cAMP responses in CHO-SecR cells. Cells that were 80–90% confluent (∼72 h after plating in a 24-well plate) were stimulated with either secretin or fluorescent probes. The cells were incubated with increasing concentrations of peptide (ranging from 10–11 to 10–6 m) diluted in KRH buffer containing 0.2% (w/v) bovine serum albumin, 0.01% (w/v) soybean trypsin inhibitor, 0.1% (w/v) bacitracin, and 1 mm 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine for 30 min at 37 °C. After the incubation, the cells were chilled and then lysed by vigorous shaking in ice-cold 6% perchloric acid. The lysates were neutralized with 30% (w/v) KHCO3 to pH 6.0 and assayed for the accumulation of cAMP using a competition-binding assay (Diagnostic Products Corp., Los Angles, CA). Bound [3H]cAMP was quantified in a Beckman LS 6000SC liquid scintillation counter.Fluorescence Spectroscopy—The fluorescence properties of the probes were determined while in solution and when bound to the secretin receptor in the absence or presence of 10 μm GppNHp. Receptor-bound samples were prepared by incubating 50 nm fluorescent probes with secretin receptor-bearing cell membranes (50 μg of membrane protein) at room temperature for 30 min in KRH buffer, pH 7.4. The membrane suspension was then cooled and the bound and free ligand was separated by centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. All the buffers were degassed by bubbling nitrogen to avoid fluorescence quenching by dissolved oxygen. Fluorescence measurements were performed with receptor-bound membrane suspension as rapidly as possible in a 1-ml quartz cuvette. Emission spectra were collected in the range between 500 and 600 nm.Fluorescence spectroscopy was performed in a SPEX Fluoromax-3 spectrofluorometer equipped with Datamax 2.2 software. The emission spectra were acquired by setting the excitation and emission band pass at 4.00 nm, and the collected final spectra represent an average of three spectral scans with an integration time of 0.5 s/nm. The experimental sample spectra were corrected by subtracting the corresponding background spectra.Fluorescence Quenching Experiments—Collisional quenching of the receptor-bound fluorescent probes with the hydrophilic quenching reagent, potassium iodide, was monitored as described earlier (24Harikumar K.G. Pinon D.I. Wessels W.S. Prendergast F.G. Miller L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 18552-18560Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). This was performed by constant wavelength analysis mode with two data acquisition trials with an integration time of 10 s. Receptor-bound probes were prepared as described earlier with 50 μg of membrane protein. Excitation and emission wavelengths were set at 481 and 521 nm, respectively. Fluorescence was measured after sequential additions of potassium iodide to the cuvette (1 m potassium iodide stock in 10 mm Na2S2O3 to prevent air-induced oxidation). The effects of dilution and ionic strength were calibrated by adding potassium chloride (1 m KCl) to the control sample and measuring the fluorescence. Background-corrected data were plotted according to the Stern-Volmer equation, Fo/F = 1 + KSV[Q], where Fo/F is the ratio of fluorescence intensity in the absence and presence of iodide. The Stern-Volmer quenching constant, KSV, was determined from the slope of Fo/F as a function of the iodide concentration [I–]. The bimolecular quenching constant (Kq) was determined by utilizing the value of mean fluorescence lifetime (<τ>, as described previously (25Harikumar K.G. Clain J. Pinon D.I. Dong M. Miller L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 1044-1050Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) (Kq (Kq = Ksv/<τ>).Fluorescence Anisotropy Measurements—Steady-state anisotropy measurements were recorded using a Fluoromax 3 spectrofluorophotometer equipped with an L-format single channel automatic polarizer and a thermostatically regulated cuvette holder. The polarizer was aligned with excitation at 0 ° and emission at 55°. Measurements were performed with constant optimal wavelengths for excitation and emission for the specific fluorophores, as noted above. The anisotropy measurements were carried out by Constant Wavelength Analysis mode with a 10-s integration time of two trial measurements. Emission intensities were measured with excitation-side polarizer in the vertical position (V) and emission-side polarizer in the horizontal (H) and vertical (V) positions. Excitation and emission wavelengths were fixed at 481 and 521 nm, respectively. The anisotropy and polarization measurements were performed at 4, 20, and 37 °C. Anisotropy was calculated according to the equation, A = (IVV– GIVH)/(IVV + 2GIVH), where IVV is the intensity measured with both the excitation side and emission side polarizers in the vertical positions, and IVH is the intensity measured with the excitation side polarizer in the vertical position and the emission side polarizer in the horizontal position. The value of G was calculated by the equation, G = IHH/IHV or (Sv/SH), with G representing the ratio of detection sensitivity of vertically and horizontally polarized light.Time-resolved Fluorescence Spectroscopy—The time-correlated single photon counting method was employed to measure the fluorescence lifetimes of probes that were free in solution or bound to receptor. Receptor-bound probes were analyzed in a cuvette with a path length of 1 cm. Samples were excited using a pulse-picked, frequency-doubled titanium-sapphire picosecond laser (Coherent Mira 900, Palo Alto, CA). Fluorescence emission was collected at 25 °C through interference filters having 6.8 nm bandwidth. The excitation wavelength was tunable with a pulse width of ∼2 ps full-width half-maximum. Data were collected in 1080 channels, with a width of 10.05 ps/channel. Fluorescence decay data were collected using modules for instrument control and time amplitude A/D conversion in the Ortec Maestro-32 software package. Fluorescence intensity decay analysis was performed using version 1.2 of the GLOBALS Unlimited program. Models of a single exponential and dual discrete exponential lifetime components were utilized and the average lifetime was calculated as described previously (24Harikumar K.G. Pinon D.I. Wessels W.S. Prendergast F.G. Miller L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 18552-18560Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The quality of fit was judged using Chi-squared (χ2) statistics.RESULTSCharacterization of Fluorescent Probes—Each of the four fluorescent probes, Alexa-secretin, (Lys13-Alexa)secretin, (Lys22-Alexa)secretin, and secretin-Gly28-(Cys29-Alexa), were synthesized and purified to homogeneity by reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography. Each had its structure verified by mass spectroscopy. Functional characterization of these probes was monitored by performing receptor-binding assays using plasma membranes isolated from receptor-expressing CHO-SecR cells, and cAMP stimulation assays in intact cells. Competition binding studies demonstrated that these fluorescent peptide probes were able to bind to the secretin receptor specifically, saturably, and with high affinity, although the probe with Alexa at the amino terminus had its affinity reduced by approximately 1 order of magnitude (Fig. 2A and Table 1). Whereas such a shift in affinity could affect the ability of such a probe to indicate the environment of the amino terminus of secretin, it continued to be a fully efficacious agonist (see below), supporting the value of this probe. The affinities of the other probes were not statistically different from that of natural secretin.FIGURE 2Binding characteristics of fluorescent probes. Shown are the curves reflecting the ability of Alexa Fluor 488-ligand probes to compete in a concentration-dependent manner for binding of a secretin radioligand, [125I-Tyr10]secretin, to CHO-SecR cell membranes (A). Shown are secretin competition-binding curves that demonstrate the ability of GppNHp to convert the receptor into its low affinity, G protein-uncoupled state (B).

Grossmann M. Ji I. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17299-17302Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (547) Google Scholar). Indeed, incubation with 10 μm GppNHp shifted the secretin receptor binding curve to the right compared with control, as shown in Fig. 2B, reflecting that the secretin receptor is converted by this manipulation into a low affinity state. This experimental manipulation was also directly studied with each of the fluorescent secretin probes (Fig. 3). Indeed, each probe had its apparent affinity shifted to the right in an analogous manner to natural secretin. The Ki values (nm) for these probes in the presence of GppNHp were 81.3 ± 12.8 for Alexa-secretin, 38.5 ± 9.1 for (Lys13-Alexa)secretin, 20.9 ± 5.1 for (Lys22-Alexa)secretin, and 14.4 ± 1.9 for secretin-Gly28-(Cys29-Alexa). We also directly examined the dissociation kinetics for each of these probes (Fig. 4).FIGURE 3Effect of GppNHp on the binding characteristics of fluorescent probes.

This interaction organizes junctional DHPRs into groups of four termed tetrads. In addition to the principle α1S subunit, the β1a subunit of the DHPR is also important for the interaction with RyR1. To probe this interaction, we measured fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) of β1a subunits labeled with cyan fluorescent protein (CFP) and/or yellow fluorescent protein (YFP). Expressed in dysgenic (α1S-null) myotubes, YFP-β1a-CFP and CFP-β1a-YFP were diffusely distributed in the cytoplasm and highly mobile as indicated by fluorescence recovery after photobleaching. Thus, β1a does not appear to bind to other cellular proteins in the absence of α1S. FRET efficiencies for these cytoplasmic β1a subunits were ∼6-7%, consistent with the idea that <10 nm separates the N and C termini. After coexpression with unlabeled α1S (in dysgenic or β1-null myotubes), both constructs produced discrete fluorescent puncta, which correspond to assembled DHPRs in junctions and that did not recover after photobleaching. In β1-null myotubes, FRET efficiencies of doubly labeled β1a in puncta were similar to those of the same constructs diffusely distributed in the cytoplasm and appeared to arise intramolecularly, since no FRET was measured when mixtures of singly labeled β1a (CFP or YFP at the N or C terminus) were expressed in β1-null myotubes. Thus, DHPRs in tetrads may be arranged such that the N and C termini of adjacent β1a subunits are located >10 nm from one another.

Excitation-contraction (EC) 2The abbreviations used are: EC, excitation-contraction; DHPR, dihydropyridine receptors; RyR, ryanodine receptor; FRET, fluorescence resonance energy transfer; CFP, cyan fluorescent protein; YFP, yellow fluorescent protein; GFP, green fluorescent protein; SR, sarcoplasmic reticulum. 2The abbreviations used are: EC, excitation-contraction; DHPR, dihydropyridine receptors; RyR, ryanodine receptor; FRET, fluorescence resonance energy transfer; CFP, cyan fluorescent protein; YFP, yellow fluorescent protein; GFP, green fluorescent protein; SR, sarcoplasmic reticulum. coupling in skeletal muscle involves conformational coupling between the dihydropyridine receptor (DHPR), a voltage-gated calcium channel present in the plasma membrane, and the type 1 ryanodine receptor (RyR1) in the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR). Specifically, the DHPR responds to membrane depolarization by inducing the opening of RyR1 and the release of Ca2+ from the SR. Although the DHPR can function as a calcium channel, skeletal type EC coupling does not require the entry of extracellular Ca2+, leading to the idea that DHPRs and RyR1 interact mechanically. Indeed, DHPRs in skeletal muscle are arranged in groups of four, termed tetrads, such that each DHPR within a tetrad is apposed to one of the four, identical subunits of RyR1 (1Block B.A. Imagawa T. Campbell K.P. Franzini-Armstrong C. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 107: 2587-2600Crossref PubMed Scopus (581) Google Scholar). The DHPR consists of a principal α1S subunit, which contains the ion-conducting pathway and voltage sensing structures, together with auxiliary β1a, α2δ-1, and γ1 subunits (for review, see Ref. 2Arikkath J. Campbell K.P. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2003; 13: 298-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar). A significant body of evidence indicates that the cytoplasmic loop connecting α1S homology repeats II and III (the II-III loop) plays an important role in conformational coupling between the DHPR and RyR1. The auxiliary β1a subunit appears to be similarly important. One essential function of all calcium channel β subunits (currently known to be encoded by four different genes) is that of facilitating trafficking to the plasma membrane, which occurs largely as a consequence of β binding to the α1 I-II loop. Consequently, knock-out of the gene encoding the predominant form in skeletal muscle (β1) causes a nearly complete absence of DHPRs in the plasma membrane (3Strube C. Beurg M. Powers P.A. Gregg R.G. Coronado R. Biophys. J. 1996; 71: 2531-2543Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) and a resultant loss of EC coupling (4Beurg M. Sukhareva M. Ahern C.A. Conklin M.W. Perez-Reyes E. Powers P.A. Gregg R.G. Coronado R. Biophys. J. 1999; 76: 1744-1756Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Significantly, truncating or altering the sequence of the β1a C-terminal preserves membrane expression but suppresses EC coupling (5Beurg M. Ahern C.A. Vallejo P. Conklin M.W. Powers P.A. Gregg R.G.

J. 2004; 87: 929-942Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), indicating that this region is important for communication between the DHPR and RyR1. All β subunits can be subdivided into five regions: highly variable N- and C-terminal regions flanking a core segment with three regions. Crystal structures have been recently reported for this core segment (7Opatowsky Y. Chen C.C. Campbell K.P. Hirsch J.A. Neuron. 2004; 42: 387-399Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar, 8Van Petegem F. Clark K.A. Chatelain F.C. Minor Jr., D.L.

Nature. 2004; 429: 675-680Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar), which confers the principal functional properties on full-length β subunits. Within the core segment, the first region is highly conserved among β subunits and is homologous to canonical Src homology 3 domains. The third region of the core segment is also highly conserved and is guanylate kinase-like. The Src homology 3- and guanylate kinase-like domains are linked by a more variable, flexible loop so that the core segment as a whole shares structural features with the membrane-associated guanylate kinases, a protein family that organizes signaling components near membranes (10Hanlon M.R. Berrow N.S. Dolphin A.C. Wallace B.A. FEBS Lett. 1999; 445: 366-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Based on sequence alignment of β1a with β2a (GenBank™ numbers: M25514 and M80545), and on the crystal structure of the β2a core segment, leucine 74 and threonine 463 of β1a are likely separated by 42 Å. However there is little basis for predicting the structure of the β1a segments N-terminal (73 residues) and C-terminal (61 residues) to the core. Thus, one goal of the present experiments was to obtain a rough idea about the separation of the N and C termini of β1a and about whether or not there were large changes in the relative arrangements of the N and C termini as a consequence of the binding of β1a to α1S. A second goal was to obtain information about the arrangement of β1a subunits within tetrads. Toward these ends, we measured fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) with cyan fluorescent protein (CFP) and yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) used as the donor and acceptor, respectively (11Siegel R.M. Chan F.K. Zacharias D.A. Swofford R. Holmes K.L. Tsien R.Y. Lenardo M.J. Science's STKE. 2000; 2000: PL1Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). The β1a subunits were singly labeled on either the N or C terminus with either CFP or YFP or doubly labeled with CFP on one terminal and YFP on the other. These fluorescently labeled β1a subunits were expressed in dysgenic (α1S-null) or β1-null myotubes. We found that the β1a subunit was incorporated into fluorescent puncta at the cell surface (indicative of junctional targeting) only when the α1S subunit was also present. Based on intramolecular FRET, it appears that the N and C termini of β1a are <10 nm apart. Additionally, the absence of intermolecular FRET between singly labeled subunits is consistent with the idea that the N and C termini of β1a subunits are directed away from the center of tetrads. Generation of the Constructs Expressed in Myotubes—Fig. 1 illustrates the β1a constructs that were used for this study. The coding sequence for rabbit skeletal muscle β1a (GenBank™ number M25514) was isolated by using PCR to introduce EcoRI and SalI sites immediately before the ATG start codon and immediately after the last codon, respectively. The EcoRI-SalI segment containing the β1a coding sequence was then ligated to EcoRI/SalI-digested pEYFP-C1, pEYFP-N1, pECFP-C1, or pECFP-N1 (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA) to obtain the constructs YFP-β1a, β1a-YFP, CFP-β1a, and β1a-CFP, respectively. To construct CFP-β1a-YFP, CFP-β1a and β1a-YFP were individually digested with MfeI, and the 5903-bp fragment obtained from CFP-β1a and the 1128-bp fragment from β1a-YFP were ligated together. For the YFP-β1a-CFP construct, YFP-β1a and β1a-CFP were individually digested with MfeI, and the 5903-bp fragment from YFP-β1a and the 1128-bp fragment from β1a-CFP were ligated together. Unlabeled β1a was obtained by digesting β1a-YFP with Acc651 and BsrGI, discarding the small fragment containing the YFP sequence, and re-ligating the large fragment containing the β1a coding sequence. Unlabeled α1S was obtained as described previously (12Papadopoulos S. Leuranguer V. Bannister R.A. Beam K.G. J. Biol.

Methods Cell Biol. 1997; 52: 283-306Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, myoblasts were plated into 35-mm culture dishes (MatTek, Ashland, MA) with glass coverslip bottoms that had been coated with ECL (Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY) and grown for 6-7 days in a humidified 37 °C incubator with 5% CO2. The culture medium, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 20% fetal bovine serum, was then replaced by differentiation medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 2% horse serum), and after 2-4 days single nuclei of myotubes were microinjected with a small amount of plasmid DNA in water. The DNA concentration in the injection solution was 10-20 ng/μl for both β1a constructs and 40 ng/μl for α1S. The ability of the α1S and β1a constructs to support EC coupling in dysgenic or β1-null myotubes, respectively, was assayed by the presence of spontaneous contractions and/or evoked contractions. To test for evoked contractions, the myotubes were placed in physiological saline (containing in mm: 140 NaCl, 1.5 KCl, 1 MgCl2, 2.5 CaCl2, 11 glucose, 10 HEPES, pH 7.4 with NaOH) and stimulated with 100-V, 15-30-ms pulses applied via a patch pipette that contained physiological saline and was positioned near the myotube. Images of these myotubes were acquired at a rate of ∼11 Hz. The contractions were quantified by measuring the movement of an identifiable portion of a myotube across the visual field. Measurement of Ionic Currents—Macroscopic Ca2+ currents were measured using the whole-cell patch clamp method. Patch pipettes of borosilicate glass had resistances of 1.8-2.2 MΩ when filled with an intracellular solution containing (mm): 110 CsCl, 3 MgCl2, 10 Cs2EGTA, 10 HEPES, 3 Mg-ATP, and 0.6 GTP, pH = 7.4 with CsOH. The external bath solution contained (mm): 10 CaCl2, 145 tetraethylammonium-Cl, 0.003 tetrodotoxin, 0.02 N-benzyl-p-toluene sulfonamide, and 10 HEPES, pH = 7.4 with tetraethylammonium-OH. To measure L-type current, myotubes were stepped from the holding potential (-80 mV) to -30 mV for 1 s (to inactivate endogenous T-type current), repolarized to -50 mV for 30-50 ms, depolarized to varying test potentials (Vtest) for 200 ms, and then returned to the holding potential. Cell capacitance was determined by integration of the capacity transient resulting from 30-mV hyperpolarizations from the holding potential and was used to normalize current amplitudes (pA/pF) obtained from different myotubes. Current-voltage curves were fitted using the Boltzmann expression: I = Gmax* (V - Vrev)/{1 + exp[- (V - V½)/kG]}, where I is the current for the test potential V, Vrev is the reversal potential, Gmax is the maximum Ca2+ channel conductance, V½ is the half-maximal activation potential and kG is the slope factor. Measurement of FRET and Fluorescence Recovery after Photobleaching—Measurement of FRET was as described previously (12Papadopoulos S. Leuranguer V. Bannister R.A. Beam K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 44046-44056Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Briefly, intact fluorescent myotubes were examined 48 h after cDNA microinjection using an LSM 510 META laser scanning confocal microscope (Zeiss, Thornwood, NY). In a typical experiment, an image of the cell region of interest was taken using standard spectroscopic settings: CFP and YFP were excited with separate sweeps of the 458 and 514 nm lines, respectively, of an argon laser (30 milliwatt maximum output, operated at 50% or 6.3 A) attenuated to 10 and 2%, respectively, and directed to the cell via a 458/514 nm dual dichroic mirror. The emitted fluorescence was split via a 515 nm dichroic mirror and for CFP was directed to a photomultiplier equipped with a 465-495 nm bandpass filter (Chroma, Rockingham, Vermont) and for YFP was directed to a photomultiplier equipped with a 530-nm-long pass filter. Confocal fluorescence intensity data (ICFPpre and IYFPpre) were recorded as the average of four line scans per pixel and digitized at 8 bits. Repeated scans (20-60) with unattenuated 514 nm illumination were used to photobleach YFP, which required ∼30-120 s at maximal scan rates. After completion of YFP bleaching, fluorescence intensity (ICFPpost and IYFPpost) was measured using the identical parameters as before bleaching. FRET efficiency (E) in percent was calculated as E = (ICFPpost - ICFPpre/ICFTpost) × 100%, where ICFPpre and ICFPpost are the background-corrected CFP fluorescence intensities before and after photobleaching YFP, respectively. Data are reported as mean ± S.D. Statistical significance was tested with an unpaired Student's t test. To measure the recovery of yellow fluorescence after photobleaching of YFP, myotubes were first imaged for cyan and yellow fluorescence as already described above. Within this image, a smaller region-of-interest was designated for photobleaching of YFP, which was accomplished with repeated scans of non-attenuated 514 nm excitation. Complete bleaching required about 70 s (similar sized regions of interest were used for all these experiments). Images of cyan and yellow fluorescence were then obtained as above every ∼30 s, beginning immediately after, and continuing until ∼400 s after, completion of the bleaching. β1a Subunit Constructs Are Targeted to the Membrane in the Presence of α1S and Restore EC Coupling and L-type Ca2+ Current—To analyze the arrangement of β1a subunits at plasma membrane/SR junctions, both singly labeled (CFP-β1a, YFP-β1a, β1a-CFP, and β1a-YFP) and doubly labeled (CFP-β1a-YFP and YFP-β1a-CFP) constructs were examined. Confocal microscopy and functional measurements were used to verify that these fusions of one or two fluorescent proteins to the β1a subunit did not affect targeting or the ability of the DHPR to function as a voltage sensor for EC coupling. Fig. 2 illustrates confocal fluorescence sections of myotubes expressing CFP-β1a-YFP. After expression in dysgenic myotubes (lacking α1S), CFP-β1a-YFP was diffusely distributed within the cytoplasm of the cell (Fig. 2a). When the same construct was coexpressed with unlabeled α1S in dysgenic myotubes, it was arranged in fluorescent puncta, many of which were close to the surface of the cell (Fig. 2b). Similar, fluorescent puncta were also observed when CFP-β1a-YFP was expressed in b1-null myotubes, which endogenously express α1S (Fig. 2c). Patterns of fluorescence like those illustrated for CFP-β1a-YFP in Fig. 2 were also seen for YFP-β1a-CFP (data not shown). The diffuse fluorescence of β1a in absence of α1S, and the punctate fluorescence in the presence of α1S, agrees with previous results with CFP-YFP-tagged β1a (12Papadopoulos S. Leuranguer V. Bannister R.A. Beam K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 44046-44056Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), as well as with results from GFP-tagged β1a (16Neuhuber B. Gerster U. Doring F. Glossmann H. Tanabe T. Flucher B.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 5015-5020Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Furthermore, in the latter study, the puncta of GFP fluorescence colocalized with puncta of α1S and RyR1 as revealed by immunolabeling. Thus, the diffuse fluorescence appears to represent the β1a subunit free in the myoplasm of the cell, whereas the fluorescent puncta appear to correspond to DHPRs inserted into junctional regions of the plasma membrane. All of the singly labeled β1a constructs had the same type of expression pattern as shown in Fig. 2 for doubly labeled β1a. Moreover, when mixes of singly labeled β1a constructs (CFP-β1a + β1a-YFP, CFP-β1a + YFP-β1a, or β1a-CFP + β1a-YFP) were expressed in β1-null cells, colocalized puncta of cyan and yellow fluorescence were observed (Fig. 3). Thus, the clusters of DHPRs, which produce the visible puncta, appeared to contain the CFP- and YFP-tagged β1a with approximately equal probability. Previously, we demonstrated that the presence of a CFP-YFP tandem on either the N or C terminus of β1a did not affect function of the DHPR as either a voltage sensor for EC coupling or as an L-type Ca2+ channel (12Papadopoulos S. Leuranguer V. Bannister R.A. Beam K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 44046-44056Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). To determine whether the addition of fluorescent proteins to both the N and C termini affected function of β1a, we measured evoked contractions and L-type Ca2+ currents in β1-null myotubes expressing CFP-β1a-YFP. Such myotubes produced robust contractions in response to focal extracellular stimulation (Fig. 4A and Table 1) and also produced large, whole-cell L-type Ca2+ currents (Fig. 4, B and C). Thus, the function of β1a did not appear to be altered by the attachment of fluorescent proteins.TABLE 1Restoration of evoked contractions in β1-null cellsConstructsRestoration of EC couplingCFP-β1a-YFP10/12YFP-β1a-CFP16/20YFP-β1a16/20β1a-YFP15/18 Open table in a new tab Photobleaching of Labeled β1a Subunits—To further compare labeled β1a subunits in the absence and presence of α1S, subregions of cells were subjected to intense illumination at 514 nm to bleach YFP. Fig. 5 illustrates this kind of experiment for YFP-β1a-CFP expressed in either a dysgenic myotube without α1S (A) or coexpressed in a dysgenic myotube together with unlabeled α1S (B). In the absence of α1S, both the yellow and cyan fluorescence had a diffuse appearance. The β1a subunits producing this diffuse pattern appeared to be freely mobile, since immediately after the bleaching episode (total duration of 70 s), there was a partial loss of yellow fluorescence outside the portion of the myotube exposed to bleaching illumination, and within the bleached region the intensity of yellow fluorescence gradually increased as the distance to the non-bleached portion of the myotube decreased (Fig. 5A, panel b). Moreover, by 400 s after the end of the bleaching episode, there was a restoration of uniform pattern of yellow fluorescence observed prior to bleaching (Fig. 5A, panel c). The time course of the yellow fluorescence intensity in Fig. 5C clearly shows recovery within the bleached region relative to the non-bleached region, while the cyan fluorescence remains relatively stable. Note the small increase in cyan fluorescence immediately after the bleaching of YFP, indicative of the FRET from CFP to YFP prior to bleaching. These results appear to indicate that there is negligible binding of the labeled β1a subunits to cellular structures. By contrast, the majority of β1a subunits in the presence of α1S appeared to be immobile because of anchoring within junctional membranes. Thus, there was a sharp demarcation in yellow fluorescence between bleached and non-bleached regions of the myotube and no loss of yellow fluorescence in the non-bleached regions (Fig. 5B, panel b). Furthermore, even 400 s after the completion of bleaching (Fig. 5B, panel c), there was essentially no recovery of yellow fluorescence within puncta inside the bleached region, although a small amount of diffuse fluorescence did recover within the bleached region. The corresponding time course of YFP fluorescence intensity within (YELLOW 2) as well as outside (YELLOW 1) the bleached area is shown in Fig. 5D. The small continuous decrease of YELLOW 1 can be attributed to bleaching due to repetitive scanning whereas the slow recovery of YELLOW 2 may reflect diffusional invasion of β1a subunits not associated with α1S subunits. Results similar to those illustrated in Fig. 5A were obtained from a total of 6 dysgenic myotubes without α1S and similar to those illustrated in Fig. 5B from a total of 3 dysgenic myotubes plus unlabeled α1S and a total of 2 β1-null myotubes. Measurement of Intra- and Intermolecular FRET—For doubly labeled β1a, FRET efficiencies were compared for subunits diffusely distributed in the cytoplasm with the efficiencies for subunits associated with α1S subunits in plasma membrane/SR junctions (Fig. 6). Diffuse cytoplasmic distribution was studied by expression in dysgenic myotubes without α1S (see Fig. 2a). For CFP-β1a-YFP and YFP-β1a-CFP in the cytoplasm, the FRET efficiencies were 6.9 ± 1.8 and 5.9 ± 1.9, respectively. For the doubly labeled subunits targeted to junctional membranes, the FRET efficiency varied depending on the conditions of expression. When coexpressed in dysgenic myotubes with unlabeled α1S (see Fig. 2b) the FRET efficiencies were reduced compared with those of the same constructs in the cytoplasm, being 3.4 ± 1.1 and 3.3 ± 1.6% for CFP-β1a-YFP and YFP-β1a-CFP, respectively. Two issues complicate the interpretation of this result. First, the measured FRET efficiency for doubly labeled β1a subunits in junctions could contain contributions from both intra- and intermolecular FRET. Second, dysgenic myotubes endogenously express β1a subunits, which could have reduced intermolecular FRET. To investigate the latter, the doubly labeled constructs were expressed in β1-null myotubes (see Fig. 2c). Under these conditions, the FRET efficiencies were 7 ± 2.8 and 5.6 ± 2.6% for CFP-β1a-YFP and YFP-β1a-CFP, respectively. Thus, FRET efficiencies for doubly labeled β1a in junctions were higher in β1-null myotubes (Fig. 6, iii) than in dysgenic myotubes (Fig. 6, ii). To confirm that this difference was a consequence of the presence of unlabeled β1a, FRET efficiencies were measured for the doubly labeled constructs coexpressed with unlabeled β1a in β1-null myotubes, which yielded FRET efficiencies of 3.1 ± 0.9% for CFP-β1a-YFP and 3.0 ± 1.9% for YFP-β1a-CFP (Fig. 6, iv). Thus, the presence of unlabeled β1a under two conditions (dysgenic myotubes + unlabeled α1S: Fig. 6, ii; and β1-null myotubes + unlabeled β1a: Fig. 6, iv) yielded FRET efficiencies about half those of the doubly labeled, junctionally targeted constructs in the absence of unlabeled β1a (Fig. 6, iii). One way to explain the results in Fig. 6 is to suppose that (i) intramolecular FRET is lower for doubly labeled β1a in junctions compared with that in cytoplasm and (ii) the measured FRET efficiency for doubly labeled β1a in junctions contains contributions from both intra- and intermolecular FRET. Accordingly, the presence of unlabeled β1a would reduce the contribution of the inter-molecular component. If this explanation were correct, one would expect to be able to measure intermolecular FRET with singly labeled constructs. This was tested by coexpression in β1-null myotubes of 1:1 mixtures of CFP-β1a + YFP-β1a, β1a-CFP + β1a-YFP, or CFP-β1a + β1a-YFP. For none of these mixtures was detectable FRET observed (Table 2), which argues against a contribution of intermolecular FRET for the doubly labeled β1a constructs in β1-null myotubes.TABLE 2FRET efficiency of the β1a subunit constructsCell typeConstructsFRET efficiency mean ± S.D.%DysgenicCFP-β1a-YFP6.9 ± 1.8 (8)YFP-β1a-CFP5.9 ± 1.9 (9)CFP-β1a-YFP + α1s3.4 ± 1.1 (6)YFP-β1a-CFP + α1s3.3 ± 1.6 (12)β1-nullCFP-β1a-YFP7 ± 2.8 (7)YFP-β1a-CFP5.6 ± 2.6 (12)CFP-β1a-YFP + β1a3.1 ± 0.9 (5)YFP-β1a-CFP + β1a3 ± 1.9 (6)CFP-β1a + YFP-β1a0 (4)β1a-CFP + β1a-YFP0 (5)CFP-β1a + β1a-YFP0 (6) Open table in a new tab The four major findings of the present work are as follows. First, the addition of fluorescent protein to the N terminus, C terminus, or both termini of β1a does not interfere with its targeting or function. In the presence of α1S (in β1-null myotubes or coexpressed with α1S in dysgenic myotubes), the β1a constructs are incorporated into DHPRs that are present in punctate regions of the plasma membrane that form junctions with the SR. The DHPRs containing these labeled β1a subunits retain the ability to mediate excitation-contraction coupling. Second, in the absence of α1S, there were no foci of β1a indicative of binding to other cellular structures and these β1a subunits appeared to be freely diffusible in the cytoplasm. Third, in the cytoplasm: the 6-7% intramolecular FRET efficiency of the doubly labeled constructs (CFP-β1a-YFP or YFP-β1a-CFP) expressed in dysgenic myotubes indicates that the N and C termini of cytoplasmic β1a subunits are likely separated by <10 nm. Fourth, within junctions: there was no measurable intermolecular FRET for 1:1 mixtures of CFP-β1a + YFP-β1a, β1a-CFP + β1a-YFP, or CFP-β1a + β1a-YFP expressed in β-null myotubes. This result is consistent with the idea that then N and C termini of adjacent β1a subunits are >10 nm apart, which would occur if they were oriented away from the center of tetrads. After expression in dysgenic myotubes lacking α1S, doubly labeled β1a was diffusely distributed (Figs. 2a and 5A). Such a diffuse distribution would seem to indicate that in the absence of α1S, the β1a subunits do not bind to immobile cellular structures. Consistent with this idea, yellow fluorescence at the ends of dysgenic myotubes showed substantial recovery within several minutes following the selective bleaching of YFP within YFP-β1a-CFP or CFP-β1a-YFP. The observation here that doubly labeled β1a is diffusely distributed in the absence of α1S is consistent with earlier results showing a diffuse distribution after expression in dysgenic myotubes of either β1a subunits tagged with a CFP-YFP tandem (12Papadopoulos S. Leuranguer V. Bannister R.A. Beam K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 44046-44056Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) or with GFP (16Neuhuber B. Gerster U. Doring F. Glossmann H. Tanabe T. Flucher B.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 5015-5020Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). However, small, weak puncta on a diffuse background were observed following immunostaining for endogenous β1a in dysgenic myotubes, from which it was concluded that the isolated β1a subunits could bind to some component of plasma membrane/SR junctions (14Gregg R.G. Messing A. Strube C. Beurg M. Moss R. Behan M. Sukhareva M. Haynes S. Powell J.A. Coronado R. Powers P.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 13961-13966Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). One possible explanation for the discrepancy between the results with immunostaining and expressed fluorescent protein-labeled β1a is that immunostaining puncta in dysgenic myotubes reflect nonspecific sites of anti-β1a antibody binding. Alternatively, the presence of fluorescent protein might interfere with the ability of isolated β1a to bind to other cellular proteins, although if this occurred it would be difficult to explain why fluorescent protein labeling had no observable effect on β1a function (12Papadopoulos S. Leuranguer V. Bannister R.A. Beam K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 44046-44056Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 16Neuhuber B. Gerster U. Doring F. Glossmann H. Tanabe T. Flucher B.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 5015-5020Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Within junctions, the FRET efficiency (E) for the doubly labeled β1a was 6-7% in β1-null myotubes (where no unlabeled β1a was present) and decreased to about 3% when unlabeled β1a was present (expression in dysgenic myotubes or expression together with unlabeled β1a in β1-null myotubes). The interpretation of this result requires one to consider the possibility that measured FRET efficiency within junctions (“jun”) contained contributions from both intra- and intermolecular FRET (Ejun = ajun + e), where a and e are the intra- and intermolecular FRET efficiencies, respectively). For doubly labeled β1a in the cytoplasm (“cyt”), only intramolecular FRET would occur (Ecyt = acyt). One could then imagine a number of possibilities for why the presence of unlabeled β1a would cause a decrease in E. One possibility is that the only effect of unlabeled β1a was to reduce the contribution of intermolecular FRET in junctions (because the unlabeled β1a reduced the number of adjacent doubly labeled β1a subunits within tetrads). If this were the case, one would have to conclude that e ≥4% and that ajun ≤ 3%, which is substantially less than acyt (6-7%). This change in intramolecular FRET could be a consequence of a conformational change in β1a that occurred upon binding to α1S (for example, an increase in separation between the N and C termini). However, x-ray crystallography demonstrates that the structure of the β subunit core is little affected by binding to the AID of the α1 I-II loop (9Chen Y.H. Li M.H. Zhang Y. He L.L. Yamada Y. Fitzmaurice A. Shen Y. Zhang H. Tong L. Yang J. Nature. 2004; 429: 675-680Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). Moreover, this interpretation suffers from the weakness that intermolecular FRET was not detected for combinations of singly labeled β1a subunits (Table 2). A second possibility is that e = 0 and that the conformation of the doubly labeled β1a subunit depends upon whether or not its neighboring β1a subunit had attached fluorescent proteins. Specifically, one could imagine that the presence of two fluorescent proteins on all four β1a subunits within a tetrad produces “molecular crowding” that results in a decreased distance between the N and C termini of each of the individual β1a subunits. The presence of one or more unlabeled β1a subunits could then allow a relaxation of the doubly labeled β1a subunits to the native conformation for β1a subunits bound to α1S. An argument against molecular crowding is that previous work has shown that addition of two fluorescent proteins per β1a subunit (tagging with CFP-YFP tandems) has no discernible affect on DHPR function as channel or voltage sensor for EC coupling (12Papadopoulos S. Leuranguer V. Bannister R.A. Beam K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 44046-44056Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). A third possibility is that e = 0, the observed FRET signal from puncta is entirely intramolecular, and the effect of unlabeled β1a can be attributed to errors in measurement of cyan intensity. In particular, the contrast between the cyan fluorescence signal and cellular autofluorescence can sometimes be low. The presence of unlabeled β1a within the puncta would decrease the cyan fluorescent signal and cause a further loss of contrast. Because the autofluorescence is unaffected by bleaching of YFP, its presence would cause an underestimate of FRET efficiency, which would become worse as the contrast between cyan fluorescence and autofluoresence decreased as a result of unlabeled β1a. Whatever the explanation for the effect of unlabeled β1a on the FRET signal produced by doubly labeled β1a, it remains the case that we were unable to measure directly any intermolecular FRET from N to N terminus, from C to C terminus or from N to C terminus of adjacent β1a subunits in tetrads. Taken together with the presence of N- to C-terminal intramolecular FRET for cytoplasmic and junctional β1a, our results are consistent with the model presented in Fig. 7. Individual, β1a subunits are sufficiently compact (<10 nm) that FRET occurs between fluorescent proteins on the N and C termini. In the absence of α1S, the β1a subunits do not appear to bind to other cellular structures and are randomly distributed in the cytoplasm at an average distance too large to allow intermolecular FRET (Fig. 7A). In the presence of α1S, the β1a subunits are assembled into DHPRs, which are organized into groups of four (tetrads), where each tetrad is associated with a single RyR1 (Fig. 7B). Within tetrads, intramolecular FRET occurs within individual doubly labeled β1a subunits, but adjacent subunits are separated by too great a distance to allow FRET. The specific model illustrated in Fig. 7B is based on the arrangement proposed by Wolf et al. (17Wolf M. Eberhart A. Glossmann H. Striessnig J. Grigorieff N. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 332: 171-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), but our data are also consistent with the tetradic arrangement of DHPRs suggested by Paolini et al. (18Paolini C. Protasi F. Franzini-Armstrong C. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 342: 145-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Independent of any particular arrangement of DHPRs into tetrads, our data are most easily explained by the hypothesis that the N and C termini of β1a lie outside a 10-nm diameter circle at the center of each tetrad. An important goal of future work will be to refine our knowledge of the spatial orientation of defined DHPR regions with respect to tetrads and with respect to defined regions of RyR1."

https://openalex.org/W2051607654,"Metabolic acidosis is partially compensated by a pronounced increase in renal catabolism of glutamine. This adaptive response is sustained, in part, through increased expression of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK). Previous inhibitor studies suggested that the pH-responsive increase in PEPCK mRNA in LLC-PK1-FBPase+ cells is mediated by a p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK). These cells express high levels of the upstream kinase MAPK kinase (MKK) 3 but relatively low levels of the alternative upstream kinase MKK6.

Western blot analyses confirmed that 0.5 μg/ml doxycycline was sufficient to block transcription and that removal of doxycycline led to pronounced and sustained expression of the caMKKs and dnMKKs. Expression of caMKK6 (but not caMKK3) caused an increase in phosphorylation of p38 MAPK and an increase in the level of PEPCK mRNA that closely mimicked the effect of treatment with acidic medium (pH 6.9, 10 mm HCO3−). Only caMKK6 activated transcription of a PEPCK-luciferase reporter construct. Co-expression of both dnMKKs blocked the increases in phosphorylation of p38 MAPK and PEPCK mRNA. The latter effect closely mimicked that of the p38 MAPK inhibitor SB203580. The expression of either dnMKK3 or dnMKK6 was less effective than co-expression of both dnMKKs.

Metabolic acidosis is produced in response to various conditions, including a high protein diet, prolonged starvation, or uncontrolled type I diabetes. It is characterized by an abnormal increase in H+ ions and a corresponding decrease in HCO3− ions in the blood. This condition is partially compensated by an increased renal catabolism of glutamine that is initiated by the mitochondrial glutaminase and glutamate dehydrogenase (1Taylor L. Curthoys N.P. Biochem. Educ. 2004; 32: 291-304Google Scholar). The resulting ammonium ions are largely secreted in the urine to facilitate the excretion of titratable acids (2Tannen R.L. Sahai A. Miner.

In rat kidney, this highly coordinated and essential adaptive response is sustained, in part, by a 6-fold increase in the cytosolic phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) 2The abbreviations used are: PEPCK, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; MKK, MAPK kinase; ATF-2, activating transcription factor-2; ca, constitutively active; dn, dominant negative; TBS, Tris-buffered saline; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; JNK, c-Jun N-terminal kinase; SAPK, stress-activated protein kinase. 2The abbreviations used are: PEPCK, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; MKK, MAPK kinase; ATF-2, activating transcription factor-2; ca, constitutively active; dn, dominant negative; TBS, Tris-buffered saline; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; JNK, c-Jun N-terminal kinase; SAPK, stress-activated protein kinase.

Physiol. 1994; 267: F400-F406PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the characterization of the signaling pathway that results in enhanced expression of the PCK1 gene provides an important paradigm to characterize the mechanism by which these cells sense very slight changes in pH and subsequently activate expression of specific genes (11Curthoys N.P. Gstraunthaler G. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 281: F381-F390Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).LLC-PK1-FBPase+ cells are a gluconeogenic line of porcine renal proximal tubule-like cells (12Gstraunthaler G. Handler J.S. Am. J. Physiol. 1987; 252: C232-C238Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). They exhibit an increased ammonia synthesis from glutamine and an adaptive increase in PEPCK mRNA and enzyme activity when incubated in acidic (pH 6.9, 10 mm HCO3−) medium (13Holcomb T. Curthoys N.P. Gstraunthaler G. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 268: C449-C457Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14Gstraunthaler G. Holcomb T. Feifel E. Liu W. Spitaler N. Curthoys N.P. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 278: F227-F237PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, they serve as an excellent model system for in vitro studies of the mechanisms that mediate the adaptive responses to metabolic acidosis (11Curthoys N.P. Gstraunthaler G. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 281: F381-F390Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) mediate the regulation of gene expression in response to various stresses (15Cowan K.J. Storey K.B. J. Exp. Biol. 2003; 206: 1107-1115Crossref PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar, 16Morrison D.K. Davis R.J. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2003; 19: 91-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (645) Google Scholar). The involvement of the known MAPK activities (ERK1/2, SAPK/JNK, p38) in the signal transduction pathway that mediates the adaptive response to acidosis was examined by determining the effects of activators and inhibitors of the specific MAPK pathways on the basal and acid-induced levels of PEPCK mRNA in LLC-PK1-FBPase+ cells (17Feifel E. Obexer P. Andratsch M. Euler S. Taylor L. Tang A. Wei Y. Schramek H. Curthoys N.P. Gstraunthaler G. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 283: F678-F688Google Scholar). The addition of anisomycin, a potent but nonspecific activator of the p38 MAPK, produced an increase in phosphorylation of p38 MAPK and ATF-2, a downstream transcription factor that binds to the cAMP-response element-1 and activates expression of the PCK1 gene (18Cheong J. Coligan J.E. Shuman J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22714-22718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The activator also produced an increase in PEPCK mRNA levels comparable with that observed following treatment with acidic medium. Further experiments demonstrated that SB203580, an inhibitor of the p38 MAPK, blocked the acid-induced increase in PEPCK mRNA levels, whereas selective inhibitors of the ERK1/2 and JNK pathways had no effect (17Feifel E. Obexer P. Andratsch M. Euler S. Taylor L. Tang A. Wei Y. Schramek H. Curthoys N.P. Gstraunthaler G. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 283: F678-F688Google Scholar). However, more recent studies suggest that SB203580 also acts as a non-competitive antagonist of the CCK1 receptor, a G-protein-coupled receptor that binds cholecystokinin (19Morel C. Ibarz G. Oiry C. Carnazzi E. Berge G. Gagne D. Galleyrand J.C. Martinez J. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 21384-21393Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Thus, SB203580 lacks absolute specificity for the p38 MAPK.MAPKs are phosphorylated and activated by highly selective MAPK kinases (MKKs) (16Morrison D.K. Davis R.J. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2003; 19: 91-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (645) Google Scholar, 20Johnson G.L. Lapadat R. Science. 2002; 298: 1911-1912Crossref PubMed Scopus (3440) Google Scholar). MKK3 and MKK6 mediate the activation of p38 MAPK, which then phosphorylates and activates a number of downstream kinases and transcription factors. To firmly establish the role of p38 MAPK in the pH-responsive increase in PEPCK mRNA, LLC-PK1-FBPase+ cells were stably transfected with plasmids that express constitutively active (ca) or dominant negative (dn) forms of MKK3, MKK6, or both kinases (MKK3/6) (21Raingeaud J. Whitmarsh A.J. Barrett T. Derijard B. Davis R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1247-1255Crossref PubMed Scopus (1139) Google Scholar) from a tetracycline-responsive promoter (22Loflin P.T. Chen C.Y. Xu N. Shyu A.B. Methods (Orlando). 1999; 17: 11-20Google Scholar). The constructs encode an N-terminal FLAG tag that was used to select clonal lines of cells that exhibit very low basal expression when grown in the presence of doxycycline and that produce a pronounced and sustained expression of the transgene upon removal of doxycycline. Western and Northern blots were then used to analyze the effects of the caMKKs and the dnMKKs on the pH-dependent phosphorylation of p38 MAPK and the increase in PEPCK mRNA. The resulting data firmly established that the pH-responsive increase in PEPCK mRNA in the kidney is mediated by the p38 MAPK signaling pathway and involves activation of MKK3 and/or MKK6.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—The pGP plasmid containing the entire 3′-untranslated region of the PEPCK cDNA was obtained from Dr. Yaacov Hod (Stony Brook Health Sciences Center). Constitutively active (ca) and dominant negative (dn) constructs of MKK3 and MKK6 were provided by Dr. Roger J. Davis (University of Massachusetts) (21Raingeaud J. Whitmarsh A.J. Barrett T. Derijard B. Davis R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1247-1255Crossref PubMed Scopus (1139) Google Scholar). Anti-phospho-MKK3/6, phospho-p38, phospho-ATF-2, MKK3, p38, and ATF-2 antibodies were purchased from Cell Signaling Technologies. The anti-MKK6 antibody was obtained from Upstate Biotechnology. The anti-FLAG antibody, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 base medium, doxycycline, and cloning rings were ordered from Sigma. All of the primary antibodies were rabbit polyclonal IgGs. A donkey anti-rabbit IgG horseradish peroxidase-linked antibody from GE Healthcare was used as the secondary antibody. SuperSignal West Dura from Pierce and ECL-Plus from Amersham Biosciences were used for Western blot analysis. The resulting signals were developed using Optimum Brand x-ray films from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. TRIzol® reagent was obtained from Invitrogen. Formazol was purchased from Molecular Research Center. [α-32P]dCTP (3,000 Ci/mmol) was purchased from MP Biomedicals. The oligo-labeling kit was from Ambion.

Handler J.S. Am. J. Physiol. 1987; 252: C232-C238Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) were grown in a 50:50 mixture of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's and Ham's F-12 medium containing 5 mm glucose, 25 mm NaHCO3, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 mg/ml streptomycin, and 10% fetal bovine serum at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere. The ca and dn constructs of MKK3 and MKK6 were cloned into pTRE2, a plasmid in which the promoter contains multiple tetracycline-responsive elements (TRE). The 8C line (23Hajarnis S. Schroeder J.M. Curthoys N.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 28272-28280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) of LLC-PK1-FBPase+ cells that expresses high levels of the tTA protein were co-transfected with 5 μg of the various pTRE constructs and 0.5 μg of pcDNA3.1/Hygro (Invitrogen) using a calcium phosphate protocol (24Chen C. Okayama H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2745-2752Crossref PubMed Scopus (4810) Google Scholar). The transfected cells were selected for growth in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 medium containing 0.2 mg/ml G418, 0.6 mg/ml hygromycin, and 0.5 μg/ml doxycycline. The G418 was necessary to maintain the plasmid that expresses the tTA protein, and the doxycycline was added to prevent expression of the caMKK or dnMKK proteins. The cells were allowed to select for approximately 3 weeks. The resulting colonies were separated with cloning rings, and the clonal lines were expanded in medium containing 0.2 mg/ml G418, 0.2 mg/ml hygromycin, and 50 ng/ml doxycycline.Preparation of Cell Lysates—Prior to harvesting, the medium was removed and the cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline. Cell extracts were prepared with ice-cold lysis buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm sodium chloride, 5 mm EDTA, 50 mm sodium fluoride, 40 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 200 μm sodium orthovanadate, and 10% (v/v) protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma). The cells were lysed on ice for 20 min. The lysates were then scraped and transferred to microcentrifuge tubes and centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. Aliquots of the supernatants were stored at -80 °C.Screening of Cell Lines by Western Blot Analysis—Western blots were performed using anti-FLAG antibodies to determine the basal and doxycycline-responsive expression of the caMKK and dnMKK proteins in the isolated cell lines. The clonal cells were grown for various times in the presence or absence of 0.5 μg/ml doxycycline and then harvested with lysis buffer. The protein concentrations of the lysates were determined (25Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin as the standard. Thereafter, 15 μg of each sample was separated on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. The samples were transferred to nitrocellulose, and the membrane was blocked for 2 h in 5% milk in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.1% Tween (TBS/Tween). The blot was incubated overnight at 4 °C with a 1:2000 dilution of the anti-FLAG antibody in 5% milk. The membrane was subsequently washed three times for 10 min with TBS/Tween and then incubated for 1 h at room temperature in a 1:10,000 dilution of the anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase secondary antibody. After washing three times for 10 min with TBS/Tween, the blot was developed with the ECL-Plus detection system. The cell lines that exhibited a low basal expression and large fold induction upon the removal of doxycycline were selected for further Western and Northern blot analyses.Western Blot Analyses of Cells Treated with Anisomycin or Acidic Medium—The cell lines that expressed the dnMKK constructs were grown to confluency in the presence or absence of 0.5 μg/ml doxycycline. About 24 h prior to harvest, the cells were incubated in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium to induce quiescence. The cells were then treated for 30 min with 5 μm anisomycin, a potent activator of the p38 MAPK pathway, to determine whether expression of the dnMKK construct was sufficient to block the anisomycin-mediated increase in phosphorylation of the p38 MAPK. Alternatively, the confluent cell cultures were treated for various times with acidic medium (pH 6.9) that contained 10 mm bicarbonate to determine when the maximal increase in phosphorylation of p38 MAPK occurred. The Western blots with the phospho-p38 and phospho-ATF-2 antibodies were performed using 60 μg of protein for each sample and polyvinylidene fluoride membranes. The two antibodies were diluted 1:500 in 5% bovine serum albumin in TBS/Tween. The blots were developed with the SuperSignal detection solution and exposed to x-ray films. The membranes were stripped by incubating at room temperature for 1-2 h in a solution containing 0.2 m glycine, 0.1% SDS, and 0.1% Tween. The stripped blots were reblocked in 5% milk in TBS/Tween solution for 2-3 h before reprobing with antibodies against total p38 and ATF-2. The p38 and ATF-2 antibodies were diluted 1:1000 in 5% bovine serum albumin in TBS/Tween solution. The total p38 and ATF-2 levels served as a control for protein loading. Western blots of the MKK3 and MKK6 proteins were also performed using antibodies that were diluted 1:1000 in 5% bovine serum albumin in TBS/Tween.Northern Blot Analyses—Cells were grown for 12 days in the presence and absence of 0.5 μg/ml doxycycline to ensure confluency. The cells were then maintained for 24 h in normal or acidic medium. Total cellular RNA was isolated using the TRIzol® reagent. The RNA concentration was determined by measuring the absorbance at A260. To probe for PEPCK mRNA, a 1.6-kb BglII fragment of pPCK-10 (26Yoo-Warren H. Monahan J.E. Short J. Short H. Bruzel A. Wynshaw-Boris A. Meisner H.M. Samols D. Hanson R.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 3656-3660Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar) was used. A 2.0-kb fragment of an 18 S ribosomal RNA cDNA was excised by restricting pAr2 (27D'Alessio J.M. Harris G.H. Perna P.J. Paule M.R. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 3822-3827Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) with HindIII and EcoRI. The fragments were separated on a 1% agarose gel, excised, and purified using a GENECLEAN kit (Bio101 Systems). The synthesis of oligolabeled cDNA probes and Northern analysis were performed as described previously (28Hansen W.R. Barsic-Tress N. Taylor L. Curthoys N.P. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: F126-F131PubMed Google Scholar). The blots were exposed to a PhosphorImager screen, and the intensities of the resulting bands were quantified using Molecular Dynamics Software. The level of the PEPCK mRNA was divided by the corresponding level of 18 S rRNA to correct for errors in sample loading. To compare the effectiveness of the dnMKK constructs, cells were grown in the presence of doxycycline and treated for 24 h with 10 μm SB203580, an inhibitor of p38 MAPK.Luciferase Assays—The various luciferase constructs were assembled in pGL3-Basic (Promega), which encodes the firefly luciferase gene. The PEPCK-490CAT plasmid (29Liu X. Curthoys N.P. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: F347-F355Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was restricted with BamHI and BglII to excise the -490 to +73-bp fragment of the rat PEPCK promoter. The purified fragment was then cloned into pGL3-Basic that had been restricted with BglII to produce p490Luc3. A 593-bp fragment that contained the 3′-untranslated region of the PEPCK cDNA (corresponding to nucleotides 2008-2595) was PCR-amplified from pGP using primers that created a 5′-NheI and a 3′-SpeI site. This fragment was cloned into the XbaI site of p490Luc3 to form p490Luc3-PCK3′. LLC-PK1-FBPase+ cells were grown for 7 days in 6-well plates to achieve confluence. The cells were transiently co-transfected with 0.6 μg of either p490Luc3 or p490Luc3-PCK3′ and 0.1 μg of pRL-null/well (Promega) by calcium phosphate precipitation (24Chen C. Okayama H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2745-2752Crossref PubMed Scopus (4810) Google Scholar). The experimental samples were also co-transfected with 0.6 μg/well of an expression vector that encodes the caMKK6 construct (21Raingeaud J. Whitmarsh A.J. Barrett T. Derijard B. Davis R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1247-1255Crossref PubMed Scopus (1139) Google Scholar). Approximately 24 h later, the cells were washed twice with 2 ml of phosphate-buffered saline, and then fresh medium was added. The cells were cultured for an additional 24 h and then washed twice with 2 ml of phosphate-buffered saline. Cell extracts were prepared and assayed using the reagents contained in the Dual Luciferase reporter assay. The firefly luciferase activities obtained from the various pLuc3 plasmids were divided by the corresponding Renilla luciferase activities to correct for differences in transfection efficiency. The mean of the ratio of luciferase activities measured with p490Luc3 was normalized to a value of 1.RESULTSEndogenous Levels and Phosphorylation of MKK3 and MKK6—Western blot analyses indicated that the non-gluconeogenic LLC-PK1 cells expressed high endogenous levels of both MKK3 and MKK6. By contrast, the derived LLC-PK1-FBPase+ cells maintained high levels of MKK3, but expressed relatively low levels of MKK6 (Fig. 1A). To determine in LLC-PK1-FBPase+ cells whether MKK3 and/or MKK6 function upstream of p38 MAKP and ATF-2, the cells were treated with serum-free medium for 24 h and then stimulated by the addition of 5 μm anisomycin (17Feifel E. Obexer P. Andratsch M. Euler S. Taylor L. Tang A. Wei Y. Schramek H. Curthoys N.P. Gstraunthaler G. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 283: F678-F688Google Scholar). This treatment produced a time-dependent increase in the phosphorylation of MKK3/6 and coordinate increases in phosphorylation of p38 MAPK and ATF-2 that reached a maximum within 30 min after stimulation (Fig. 1B). The changes in phosphorylation of MKK3/6, p38 MAPK, and ATF-2 occurred without changes in the levels of the p38 MAPK protein (Fig. 1B) or the MKK3, MKK6, and ATF-2 proteins (data not shown).Expression of caMKK6 or Treatment with Acidic Medium Produces a Similar Increase in Phosphorylation of p38 MAPK—Cells expressing either the caMKK3 or caMKK6 were cloned and then grown to confluency in the presence or absence of 0.5 μg/ml doxycycline. Western blot analysis using the anti-FLAG antibodies established that the addition of doxycycline effectively suppressed expression of the caMKK3 and the caMKK6 (Fig. 2A) and that removal of doxycycline led to a pronounced increase in the levels of the two FLAG-tagged proteins. However, when analyzed with protein-specific antibodies, only the MKK6 protein levels exhibited a pronounced increase upon removal of doxycycline. The inability to detect a similar increase in expression of the caMKK3 protein with the anti-MKK3-specific antibody is probably due to the high levels of the endogenous MKK3 protein. Cells that expressed the caMKK6 were grown in the presence of doxycycline and treated for various times with normal or acidic medium. Within 2 h after transfer to acidic medium, the cells exhibited an increase in phosphorylation of p38 MAPK that closely mimicked the increase caused by removal of doxycycline and expression of the caMKK6 (Fig. 2B). The observed changes in phosphorylation of p38 MAPK occurred without changes in the level of p38 MAPK. By contrast, removal of doxycycline from the cells that expressed the caMKK3 protein had no effect on the level of phosphorylation of the p38 MAPK.FIGURE 2Effect of expression of caMKK6 or caMKK3 on the phosphorylation of p38 MAPK. A, cells that express either caMKK6 or caMKK3 were grown in the presence (+) or absence (-) of 0.5 μg/ml doxycycline (dox). Cell extracts were separated by 10% SDS-PAGE and probed with antibodies that are specific for the FLAG tag and either MKK6 or MKK3. B, cells that express the caMKK6 or caMKK3 were grown to confluency in the presence (+) or absence (-) of doxycycline and where indicated, treated with acidic medium (pH 6.9) for 2 h. Extracts were separated by 10% SDS-PAGE and probed with antibodies that were specific for the phosphorylated p38 MAPK. The blot was stripped and reprobed with an anti-p38 MAPK antibody.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Expression of caMKK6 Increases PEPCK mRNA Levels—RNA was isolated from confluent cells carrying the caMKK6 transgene that had been grown in normal medium in the presence or absence of 0.5 μg/ml doxycycline and from cells grown in the presence of doxycycline but treated for 24 h with acidic medium. Northern blot analysis indicated that treatment with acidic medium produced a 3.5-fold increase in the level of PEPCK mRNA in cells that were maintained with doxycycline (Fig. 3). The expression of the caMKK6 construct by removal of doxycycline produced a 2.8-fold increase in PEPCK mRNA levels. By contrast, co-expression of the caMKK3 had no effect on the levels of PEPCK mRNA. Co-expression of caMKK6 also caused a 2.4-fold increase in the luciferase activity expressed from p490Luc3, a construct that contains the -490-bp segment of the rat PEPCK promoter (Fig. 4). However, co-expression of caMKK3 again had no effect on the luciferase activity of this reporter construct. The incorporation of the 3′-untranslated region of the rat PEPCK cDNA into the reporter construct resulted in a significant decrease in basal luciferase activity, consistent with the incorporation of the multiple mRNA instability elements that exist within this segment of the PEPCK mRNA (23Hajarnis S. Schroeder J.M. Curthoys N.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 28272-28280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Co-expression of caMKK6 with the 490Luc3-PCK3′ produced a similar fold stimulation as observed with p490Luc3. These data demonstrate that activation of the p38 MAPK signaling pathway by the caMKK6 enhances transcription of the PCK1 gene through elements that are contained in the -490-bp segment of the PEPCK promoter. In contrast, expression of the caMKK3 construct did not significantly affect the level of endogenous PEPCK mRNA and had no effect on the luciferase activity of either construct.FIGURE 3Comparison of the effects of the expression of either caMKK6 or caMKK3 and treatment with acidic medium on PEPCK mRNA levels. Cells that express either caMKK6 (A) or caMKK3 (B) were grown to confluency in the presence (+) or absence (-) of 0.5 μg/ml doxycycline. About 24 h prior to harvest, the indicated cells were treated with acidic medium (pH 6.9). RNA was isolated, and Northern blot analysis was performed to quantify the levels of PEPCK mRNA.
