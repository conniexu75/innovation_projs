https://openalex.org/W2069316372,"The in vitro destruction of tumor cells by specifically sensitized mouse lymphocytes was inhibited by adenosine; this inhibition was markedly potentiated by the presence of an inhibitor of adenosine deaminase. The inhibition of cytolysis by adenosine was accompanied by a rapid elevation in lymphocytic adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate (cyclic AMP) concentrations. Both the inhibition of cytolysis and the elevation of cyclic AMP were reversed by prolonged incubation of the lymphocytes in the presence of adenosine or, more rapidly, by removal of the adenosine. Low concentrations of adenosine also caused an elevation of cyclic AMP in human lymphocytes, and this effect of adenosine may contribute to the lack of immune response associated with adenosine deaminase deficiency."
https://openalex.org/W1488788730,"Addition of the polyamines spermidine, spermine, or putrescine to a fractionated mammalian cell-free protein-synthesis system programmed by a variety of mRNAs results in a 3- to 5-fold stimulation of amino acid incorporation over that found in the absence of added polyamine. The mRNAs used as template were adenovirus mRNA, globin 9s mRNA, and RNA from the bacteriophages R17, Qbeta, and MS2. The relative amounts of 10 adenovirus polypeptides synthesized in vitro are altered by the addition of polyamines to the translation system to reflect more closely the relative amounts of these polypeptides synthesized in vivo. This qualititive improvement in translation products on addition of polyamines allow the analysis of a number of products which are at best only marginally synthesized in the absence of added polyamines. The low level of synthesis due to endogenous mRNA is stimulated by spermidine and spermine but a lesser extent by putrescine."
https://openalex.org/W1544485440,"In vitro incubation of frog erythrocytes with (minus)-isoproterenol, 0.1 mM, at 23 degrees for 10 to 24 hours caused a 63% decline (rho less than 0.001) in the maximum (minus)-isoproterenol-stimulated adenylate cyclase activity in the erythrocyte membranes. Affinity for (minus)-isoproterenol as judged by the concentration which half-maximally stimulated the enzyme was not markedly altered. Basal enzyme activity and stimulation by fluoride or prostaglandin E1 remained unaltered. The number of beta-adrenergic receptor binding sites, assessed by binding studies with the beta-adrenergic antagonist (minus)-[3-H] alprenolol, declined by 50% (rho less than 0.005) in the (minus)-isoproterenol-treated cells. The binding affinity of the sites was not changed. Regulation of the concentration of functionally active beta-adrenergic receptors in membranes may be one of the mechanisms by which chronic exposure to catecholamines desensitizes tissues to beta-adrenergic stimulation."

https://openalex.org/W1970165486,"We describe a method for linking RNA and DNA covalently to finely divided cellulose through a diazotized aryl amine, which reacts primarily with guanine and uracil (thymine) residues of single strands. The high efficiency of coupling and high capacity of the cellulose for nucleic acid make possible a product with as much as 67 mug of nucleic acid per mg of cellulose. The product is especially suitable for hybridization experiments where very low backgrounds are important, and it is stable in 99% formamide at 80 degrees C so that hybridized nucleic acid can be recovered easily. Full length linear Simian Virus 40 (SV40) DNA, produced by cleavage of SV40(I) DNA with S1 nuclease, can be coupled to diazo cellulose with an efficiency of 80-90%, and is effective in hybridization experiments with SV40 DNA, complementary RNA synthesized in vitro from SV40(I) DNA with E. coli RNA polymerase, and the SV40-specific fraction of total RNA from SV40-infected and transformed cells. In these experiments an excess of cellulose-bound DNA was used, and the efficiency of hybridization was about 90% when ribonuclease treatment of the hybrids was omitted."
https://openalex.org/W1499246997,"Glucose elevates both cyclic adenosine 3:5-monophosphate (cyclic AMP) and insulin secretion rapidly and in a parallel dose-dependent fashion in perifused rat islets. Theophylline stimulates cyclic AMP much more than glucose, yet secretion is much less. When the two agents are combined, cyclic AMP is similar to theophylline alone yet secretion is augmented synergistically. Glucose-induced cyclic AMP generation and insulin secretion are dependent on extracellular calcium. Theophylline-induced insulin secretion is also extracellular calcium-dependent; however, theophylline-induced cyclic AMP elevation is independent of extracellular calcium. Thus, extracellular calcium has multiple effects on insulin secretion, some of which appear unrelated to a terminal secretory process. When glucose is combined with theophylline at physiologic levels of extracellular calcium, both the first and second phases of secretion are prominent. At extracellular calcium levels of 0.05 mM, only the second phase is prominent whereas at 10 nM extracellular calcium (ethylene glycol bis(beta-aminoethyl ether)-N,-tetraacetic acid) only the first phase is prominent. A divalent cation ionophore (a23187, Eli Lilly), which transports calcium and magnesium ions across biological membranes, was used to elucidate further the role of calcium and magnesium. If the ionophore (10 muM) is perifused for 5 min at low extracellular calcium and magnesium, and physiologic calcium is then added, a sudden spike of insulin release occurs in the absence of cyclic AMP generation. Similar results were obtained with magnesium. When the ionophore is perifused for 30 min at low calcium and magnesium, insulin secretion again occurs in the absence of cyclic AMP generation. Electron microscopic examination of the B cells following perifusion with the ionophore shows no specific alterations. These observations suggest that: (a) glucose elevates cyclic AMP, but the latter acts primarily as a positive feed-forward modulator of glucose-induced insulin release; and (b) extracellular calcium has multiple effects on insulin secretion both upon, and independent of, the cyclic AMP system."
https://openalex.org/W1486641162,"The capacity to effectively label tumor cell hostones using very short pulses of [3-H]acetate and [32-P]phosphate (1 to 10 min) has been developed. Four histone fractions F3, F2a1, F2a2, and F2b are extensively acetylated in short time periods. About 70% of the acetate accumulated on the histone during a short pulse is removed with a half-life of similar to 3 min. The rest of the metabolically active acetate is removed with a half-life of 30 to 40 min. Histones F2a1, F2a2, and F1 are acetylated at the NH2 terminus and this modification is metabolically stable. In short pulses, histones are labeled with 32-P in the order F2a2 greater than F1 greater than F3 greater than F2a1 greater than F2b. All fractions have a fairly rapid turnover time (t1/2 similar 20 to 40 min) except F1 phosphate which turns over some 5 times more slowly."
https://openalex.org/W1575068064,"Pyridoxal phosphate is a potent probe for exploring the of proteins in the membrane of the intact red blood cell. It reacts with amino groups with a high degree of specificity, forming a Schiff's base that can be fixed as an irreversible bond upon reduction with NaBH4; its binding site can be identified by use of [3-H]pyridoxal phosphate or NaB3-H4; it can be used as a surface probe under conditions of minimal penetration, or it can be used as a probe for proteins on the inside of the membrane under conditions of substantial uptake. Pyridoxal phosphate uptake involves a rapid and a slow component. The former represents the binding to the outer surface of the membrane; it is not substantially affected by pH and temperature, but is reduced considerably by pretreatment of cells by 4,4-diisothiocyano-2,2-stilbenedisulfonic acid, a specific inhibitor of anion transport. The slow component represents penetration into the cell; it is blocked by high pH, low temperature, or pretreatment with the disulfonic stilbene. Pyridoxal phosphate itself is also an effective and specific inhibitor of the permeation of other anions. Under conditions of minimal uptake, the only labeled proteins are three glycoproteins and a protein of apparent molecular weight 95,000. Under conditions of substantial uptake into the cell, the other major protein bands seen by staining on acrylamide gels after electrophoresis are labeled. It is concluded that virtually all of the major membrane proteins interact with pyridoxal phosphate from one side of the membrane or the other. The differences in labeling under conditions of minimal or maximal uptake can, therefore, be attributed to the sidedness in the distribution of the membrane proteins rather than to differences in their reactivity."

https://openalex.org/W1645822270,"The effects of epinephrine, glucagon, insulin and 1-methyl-3-isobutylxanthine on adenosine 3:5-monophosphate (cAMP)-dependent protein kinase activity were investigated in the perfused rat heart. The conditions for homogenization of heart tissue and assay of protein kinase are described. The activation state of the enzyme is expressed as the ratio of the rate of phosphorylation of histone in the absence to that in the presence of 2 mu-M cAMP. This activity ratio is stable in crude homogenates over 15 min of incubation; it is not affected by up to 30-fold dilution of the tissue volume. The ratio is elevated to a variable degree in hearts taken immediately from the animal but falls to a stable, basal level of 0.15 to 0.20 after 15 min of perfusion in vitro. An optimal concentration of epinephrine (10 mu-M) in the perfusate elevates cAMP from 0.5 to 1.3 nmol per g of tissue and increases the protein kinase activity ratio from 0.20 to 0.65. When hearts are perfused with a steady, submaximal concentration of epinephrine (0.4 mu-M), the level of cAMP and the protein kinase activity ratio rise in parallel within 15 s and remain elevated for at least 10 min. When epinephrine is removed from the perfusion medium, the level of cAMP and enzyme activity ratio decline rapidly to basal levels. Both glucagon and the phosphodiesterase inhibitor 1-methyl-3-isobutylxanthine also increase the cardiac cAMP levels and protein kinase activity ratio in a dose-dependent manner. Glucagon acts as rapidly as does epinephrine whereas 1-methyl-3-isobutylxanthine requires at least 30 s before any effect can be observed. Insulin by itself does not significantly affect the cyclic nucleotide level or enzyme activity. The hormone has not been observed to lower the cAMP level or protein kinase activity in the heart under any conditions tested. In concentrations of 10 microunits per ml or greater, it does, however, cause a slight rise in the tissue level of cAMP and the protein kinase activity when these have been elevated to intermediate levels by exposure to epinephrine. This effect could only be observed when hearts were treated with catecholamine and could not be detected with glucagon or 1-methyl-3-isobutylxanthine. In all cases tested, slight increases in the protein kinase activity ratio (from 0.2 to 0.3) were accompanied by much greater increases in the amount of phosphorylase in the a form (20% to 70%). It was observed that at perfusion times greater than 3 min, there was a significant reduction in phosphorylase activity even though both the cAMP level and protein kinase activity remained elevated. In these studies, changes in the protein kinase activity correlate well with the tissue cAMP levels under all conditions tested."
https://openalex.org/W1690297938,"DNA has been implicated as the nuclear acceptor for receptor-glucocorticoid complexes. The present study concerns the interaction of these complexes, isolated from cultured rat hepatoma cells, with purified DNA. This association is rapid, reaching a maximum within a few minutes at 0 degrees, whereas dissociation requires several hours. DNA binds neither free glucocorticoids nor those complexed with transcortin or cytosol proteins different from the receptor. Receptors which are not complexed by steroid have little or no affinity for DNA. Activation, necessary for the binding of receptor-steroid complexes to isolated nuclei, also enhances DNA binding. The capacity of DNA for binding receptor-steroid complexes is large; saturation was not observed at the complex concentrations studied, using either crude or partially purified receptor preparations. The association of complexes with DNA is inhibited by divalent cations, at increasing ionic strengths, and by mercurial reagents. Complexes bind equally well to bacterial, bacteriophage, or rat DNA; however, there was either no or substantially reduced binding by bacterial 23 S rRNA. The binding of complexes to native DNA is roughly 3-fold greater than to denatured DNA. These characteristics are consistent with the possibility that DNA is the nuclear acceptor for receptor-glucocorticoid complexes; however, the actual composition of the acceptor sites remains unknown."
https://openalex.org/W1506500848,"The effects of metabolic acidosis and of hormones on the activity, synthesis, and degradation of renal cytosolic P-enolpyruvate carboxykinase (GTP) (EC 4.1.1.32) were studied in the rat using isotopic -immunochemical procedures. At normal acid-base balance, the synthesis of the enzyme accounted for between 2 and 3.5% of the synthesis of all soluble protein in the kidney cortex. P-enolpyruvate carboxykinase synthesis was selectively stimulated in acute metabolic acidosis, so that the relative rate of synthesis of the enzyme was increased to 7% 13 hours after oral administration of ammonium chloride. The stimulation of P-enolpyruvate carboxykinase synthesis preceded any increase in the assayable activity of the enzyme. The administration of sodium bicarbonate to acutely acidotic rats returned the rate of enzyme synthesis to normal in 8 hours. The effect of acidosis on both the synthesis and the activity of P-enolpyruvate carboxykinase was prevented by actinomycin D, cordycepin, and cycloheximide. The degradation in vivo of pulse-labeled P-enolpyruvate carboxykinase was not affected by acidosis. Thus, the stimulation of P-enolpyruvate carboxykinase synthesis is the major mechanism for the increase in the level of the enzyme observed in metabolic acidosis. The administration of glucocorticoid triamcinolone resulted in an increase in the relative rate of P-enolpyruvate carboxykinase synthesis and a commensurate increase in the activity of the enzyme in the renal cortex. Both changes were abolished by actinomycin D. Fasting was characterized by a high enzyme activity and a rapid rate of enzyme synthesis in the kidney cortex. This high rate of synthesis was reduced after the administration of sodium bicarbonate, but not after glucose feeding. Moreover, the injection of insulin to diabetic rats did not repress P-enolpyruvate carboxykinase synthesis in the renal cortex. Theophylline plus N-6, 0-2'-dibutyryl adenosine 3':5'-monophosphate stimulated P-enolpyruvate carboxykinase synthesis in the kidney of intact rats. However, the latter effect was probably due to glucocorticoid secretion, since it did not occur in adrenalectomized animals. The administration of parathyroid extracts did not result in the induction of the enzyme. Thus, the hormonal regulation of cytosolic P-enolpyruvate carboxykinase synthesis in the kidney differs markedly from that in the liver."
https://openalex.org/W1832407324,"Cultures of the rat skeletal muscle myoblast cell line, L6, were treated with the mutagen ethylmethanesulfonate and grown in the presence of alpha-amanitin, an inhibitor of RNA polymerase II in vitro. One clonal cell line, Ama102, resistant tc the cytotoxic action of 2 mu-g/ml of alpha-amanitin was isolated and extensively characterized. Ama102 cells were about 30-fold more resistant to alpha-amanitin than their Ama+ parent cells based on a comparison of the concentration of alpha-amanitin required to reduce their plating efficiencies to similar extents. The RNA polymerase activities from Ama+ and Ama102 cells were solubilized and separated by DEAE-Sephadex chromatography. Whereas all of the Ama+ RNA polymerase II activity was inhibited by 0.1 mu-g/ml of alpha-amanitin, about 30% of the activity in the Ama102 RNA polymerase II peak was resistant to this concentration of alpha-amanitin and was inhibited only by much higher concentrations (25 mu-g/ml) of alpha-amanitin. This alpha-amanitin-resistant activity in Ama102 cells was identified as a bona fide RNA polymerase II by its chromatographic behavior on DEAE-Sephadex, salt optimum, preference for denatured DNA as template, insensitivity to inhibition by potassium phosphate, thermal inactivation kinetics, and inactivation by anti-RNA polymerase II antiserum. Both RNA polymerase IIa and IIb from Ama102 cells exhibited the partial alpha-amanitin resistance, as did this activity when purified further on phosphocellusose. Unlike the parental Ama+ cells, Ama102 cells neither fused at confluence nor showed an increase in the specific activity of creatine kinase. The altered sensitivity of the Ama102 RNA polymerase II to alpha-amanitin appears to account for the drug-resistant phenotype of these cells."
https://openalex.org/W1624330994,"Adenine, guanine, and hypoxanthine were rapidly incorporated into the acid-soluble nucleotide pool and nucleic acids by wild type Novikoff cells. Incorporation followed normal Michaelis-Menten kinetics, but the following evidence indicates that specific transport processes precede the phosphoribosyltransferase reactions and are the rate-limiting step in purine incorporation by whole cells. Cells of an azaguanine-resistant subline of Novikoff cells which lacked hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase activity and failed to incorporate guanine or hypoxanthine into the nucleotide pool, exhibited uptake of guanine and hypoxanthine by a saturable process. Similarly, wild type cells which had been preincubated in a glucose-free basal medium containing KCN and iodoacetate transported guanine and hypoxanthine normally, although a conversion of these purines to nucleotides did not occur in these cells. The mutant and KCN-iodoacetate treated wild type cells also exhibited countertransport of guanine and hypoxanthine when preloaded with various purines, uracil, and pyrimidine nucleosides. The cells also possess a saturable transport system for uracil although they lack phosphoribosyltransferase activity for uracil. In the absence of phosphoribosylation, none of the substrates was accumulated against a concentration gradient. Thus transport is by facilitated diffusion (nonconcentrative transport). Furthermore, the apparent Km values for purine uptake by untreated wild type and azaguanine-resistant cells were higher and the apparent Vmax values were lower than those for the corresponding phosphoribosyltransferases..."
https://openalex.org/W2001053593,"Fibrin overlay methods are described which can detect the plasminogen activator produced by single transformed cells or small colonies of transformed cells. These methods were applied to malignant cells derived from humans, mice, hamsters, rats, and chicks. The lysis observed was plasminogen dependent. Transformation of chicken cells by Rous sarcoma virus was detected 4 days after infection. The number of lysis zones produced was proportional to the virus inoculum and was identical to the number of morphologically determined foci. These methods may also have application in model systems for scoring transformation by chemicals. Transformed mouse and chicken cells were detected at the single cell level and the number of lysis zones produced was dependent on the number of cells present, the time of incubation, and the concentration of plasminogen."
https://openalex.org/W1555369835,"Incubation of liposomes prepared by sonication of egg lecithin with the amphipathic form of cytochrome b5 results in the binding of a maximum of 244 molecules of cytochrome b5 per liposomal vesicle. Interactions of the phospholipid with the hydrophobic segment of cytochrome b5 are involved in this binding which does not disrupt the liposome. When a small amount of NADH-cytochrome b5 reductase is bound liposomes simultaneously with cytochrome b5, the two proteins catalyze the reduction of cytochrome c by NADH. A qualitative kinetic analysis reveals that all of the cytochrome b5 interacts with reductase, a result consistent with these protein undergoing translational diffusion in the plane of the membrane. This system and the purified stearyl coenzyme A desaturase provide a model to study the dynamics of protein andlipid interactions in this membrane-bound oxidative sequence."
https://openalex.org/W1531885224,"The enthalpies of hydrolysis of acyclic, monocyclic, and glycoside cyclic phosphate diesters have been measured by flow microcalorimetry using a phosphohydrolase isolated from Enterobacter aerogenes as catalyst. The values so obtained (kilocalories per mol) (at 25 degrees) for sodium salts are: diethyl phosphate, minus 1.8 plus or minus 0.5; ethylene phosphate, minus 6.4 plus or minus 0.2; trimethylene phosphate, minus 3.0 plus or minus 0.2; tetramethylene phosphate, minus 2.2 plus or minus 0.1; methyl beta-D-ribofuranoside cyclic 3:5-phosphate, minus 11.1 plus or minus 0.2; methyl alpha-D-glucopyranoside cyclic 4:6-phosphate, minus 6.3 plus or minus 0.1; and cyclic adenosine 3:5-monophosphate (5-ester bond), minus 11.1 plus or minus 0.4 (10-minus 3 M Mg-2+). The enthalpy of hydrolysis of the 3-ester bond of cyclic adenosine 3:5-monophosphate (10-minus 3 M Mg-2+) has been revised to minus 11.1 plus or minus 0.2 kcal/mol from the value of minus 13.2 plus or minus 0.4 kcal/mol reported previously (greengard, p., rudolph, s.a., and sturtevant, j. m. (1969) j. biol. Chem. 244, 4798). All these values pertain to the hydrolysis of singly charged diesters to form singly charged monoesters. The data for the acyclic and monocyclic phosphodiesters are in qualitative agreement with their hydrolytic reactivities. The enthalpies measured for the hydrolysis of the glycoside cyclic phosphates cannot now be explained on the basis of their structures or reactivities; perhaps a contribution to the enthalpies by solvation or a previously unrecognized geometric strain effect may be responsible for the large exothermic enthalpies of these cyclic phosphate diesters. Changes in the heat capacity, increment Cp, for some of the hydrolytic reactions were also measured."
https://openalex.org/W162196402,"A fucolipid that carried human blood group Lea activity was isolated from human small intestine. It contianed fucose, galactose, N-acetyl glucosamine, glucose, and ceramide in a molar ratio of 1:2:1:1:1. After periodate oxidation only 1 molecule of galactose and the N-acetylglucosamine remained. Permethylation of the lipid gave derivatives of a terminal fucose and galactose residue together with 2,4,6-tri-O-methylgalactose and 2,3,6-tri-O-methylglucose. After removal of fucose the lipid could be converted to a ceramide trihexoside with beta-galactosidase, and this, in turn, to ceramide lactoside by the action of beta-N-acetylhexosaminidase. Both enzymes converted the defucosylated derivative to a ceramide monohexoside. The methylated and the methylated and reduced derivatives of the intact lipid gave ions in mass spectrometry for a terminal hexose and deoxyhexose, a terminal trisaccharide of hexose, deoxyhexose and N-acetylhexosamine, and terminal tetra-and pentasaccharides. Ceramide fragments characteristic of hydroxy fatty acids with 16, 22, 23, and 24 carbons were found together with those of phytospingosine as the major long chain base. On the basis of these results and the immunologic activity of the fucolipid, the following structure is proposed: betaGal (1 leads to 3)betaGlcNAc (1 leads to 3)betaGal (1 leads to 4)Glc-ceramide alphaFuc (1 leads to 4)."
https://openalex.org/W1484072283,"A solubilized preparation of cytochrome P-450, obtained by treatment of mitochondria from bovine corpora lutea with phospholipase A, contained all of the necessary components for the cholesterol side chain cleavage activity. The solubilized cytochrome -450 preparation could be isolated essentially free of endogenous cholesterol side chain cleavage activity by various fractionation techniques. A cholesterol side chain cleavage enzyme system was reconstituted using the isolated cytochrome P-450 preparation and purified adrenodoxin and adrenodoxin reductase (components of the enzyme system purified from the adrenal cortex). Protein kinase was partially purified from the cytosol fraction of bovine corpora lutea. It was purified 43-fold and the activity was highly dependent on cyclic adenosine 3:5-monophosphate (cyclic AMP). When ATP and this partially purified cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase were added to the reconstituted cholesterol side chain cleavage enzyme assay in which cytochrome P-450 was limiting, a stimulation (20 to 74%) of the conversion of cholesterol into pregnenolone was observed. This stimulation was statistically significant with p value less than 0.001. The stimulatory effect of the protein kinase appeared to be dependent on ATP and was not mimicked by bovine serum albumin, indicating that the effect was specific for protein kinase. Protein kinase caused a phosphorylation of the cytochrome P-450 preparation when large amounts of this preparation were used in the assay. It is concluded from these results that the direct activation of the cytochrome P-450 component of the cholesterol side chain cleavage by protein kinase may be one of the ways by which cyclic AMP mediates the effect of luteinizine."

The levels vary in a cyclic fashion and are higher during rapid eye movement sleep than during the waking state. The proteins represent a distinctive class of tissue protein and their changing levels appear to reflect an alteration in the protein content of the extracellular space of brain related to behavioral state."

https://openalex.org/W1588594446,"Specific receptors for glucocorticoids are present in liver cytosols of rat fetuses at least as early as the 18th day of gestation. The concentration of the receptor begins to decline after the 20th day reaching undetectable levels shortly before and after parturition. The receptor can be detected again 1 to 2 hours after birth, and its levels increase markedly to higher than adult values between the 2nd and 5th day. The reason for the failure to detect specific hormone binding near parturition appears to be due to occupation of binding sites by endogenous steroids rather than the absence of the receptor. This is indicated by the demonstration of both cytoplasmic and nuclear receptor sites in liver slices of newborn rats incubated with labeled dexamethasone at 37 degrees. The cytoplasmic receptors of fetal and adult liver differ in their relative affinity for cortisol and corticosterone. The fetal receptors have a higher affinity for corticosterone than cortisol while the reverse is true for the adult receptors. These observations suggest either the existence of dissimilar receptors in fetal and adult liver or the presence of more than one type of receptor sites. It is therefore possible that subtle differences in the nature of hepatic receptors may be partly responsible for the maturation-dependent qualitative differences in tissue responsiveness to glucocorticoids."
https://openalex.org/W1977699851,"We have examined the role of proteolytic activity in the genesis and maintenance of the transformed phenotype by growing cultures of chick embryo fibroblasts transfromed by Rous sarcoma virus either in medium containing plasminogen-free serum or in medium to which protease inhibitors were added. Alterations in morphology, adhesiveness, and hexose transport were used as markers for the transformed state. Addition of the trypsin inhibitors NPGB or Soy Bean Trypsin Inhibitor at concentrations which inhibited transformation-associated fibrinolysis restored adhesiveness and morphology to near normal, but did not affect the rate of hexose transport. Growth of Rous-infected cells in plasminogen-free medium blocked the appearance of morphological and adhesive alterations, but allowed the rate of hexose transport to increase to the transformed level. Thus we were able to separate the appearance of transformation-specific changes in morphology and adhesiveness (which apparently require fibrinolytic activity) from the increased rate of hexose transport (which is independent of fibrinolytic activity). Another trypsin inhibitor, TLCK, although it did not inhibit fibrinolysis, was very effective at restoring adhesiveness and morphology as well as hexose transport to normal. This raises the possibility that there is another, perhaps earlier, protease involved in the genesis of the transformed phenotype."

https://openalex.org/W1995791610,"Cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cyclic AMP) and 11 derivatives were applied to rat cerebellar Purkinje cells by iontophoresis. Cyclic AMP inhibited 63 percent of the cells, while the 8-parachlorophenylthio- and 8-benzylthio- analogs of cyclin AMP inhibited the spontaneous firing of 92 and 89 percent of cells, respectively. The ability of the 11 analogs to inhibit neuronal firing correlated ( r= + .78) with their reported potency in activating cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase. These results extend previous studies, pointing to the mediation by cyclic AMP of the noradrenergic inhibition of Purkinje neurons, and provide new physiological evidence that protein phosphorylation is a major step in the action of cyclic AMP."

https://openalex.org/W1539209087,"Avidin is a tetrametric protein (mass 68,000 daltons) that binds 4 molecules of vitamin biotin (1). The biotin binding sites, 1 per subunit, are grouped in two pairs at opposite ends of the avidin molecule (GREEN, N.M., KONIECZNY, L., TOMS, E.J., and VALENTINE, R.C. (1971) Biochem. J. 125, 781). We have studied the topography of the avidin binding sites with the aid of four spin-labeled analogs of biotin: 4-biotinamido-2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-1-piperidinyloxy (II), 3-biotinamido-2,2,5,5-tetramethyl-1-pyrrolidinyloxy (III), 3-biotinamidomethyl-2,2,5,5-tetramethyl-1-pyrrolidinyloxy (IV), 4-(biotinylglycyl)-amino-2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-1-piperidinyloxy (V). Fluorescence and optical absorption spectroscopy indicated that II to V occupied the same binding sites on avidin as did biotin. The electron spin resonance spectrum of the 4:1 complex between II and avidin contained broad line components characteristic of a highly immobilized spin label. Dipole-dipole interactions between spin labels bound to adjacent sites split each of the three major hyperfine lines into doublets with a separation of 13.8 G. The distance between adjacent bound nitroxide groups was calculated from this splitting to be 16 A. The dissociation of the 4:1 complex between II and avidin was biphasic with approximately half of the labels dissociating at a rate (kdiss equal to 2.51 times 10- minus 4 s- minus 1) that was much faster than the remainder (kdiss equal to 1.22 times 10- minus 5 s- minus 1). The electron spin resonance spectrum of the 2:1 complex between II and avidin clearly showed that, immediately after mixing, the spin labels were distributed in a random fashion among the available binding sites but that they slowly redistributed themselves so that each label bound to a site which was adjacent to an unoccupied site. The final time-independent electron spin resonance spectrum exhibited a splitting 69 G between the low and high field hyperfine lines which is characteristic of a highly immobilized, noninteracting spin label. Spin labels III and IV interacted with avidin in a similar fashion to that described for II with the exception that their dipolar splittings were 11.9 G and 14.2 G, respectively. From these splittings it was estimated that the distance between adjacent avidin-bound nitroxides was 16.7 A for labeled III and 15.7 A for label IV. The electron spin resonance spectrum of label V bound to avidin was characteristic of a noninteracting highly immobilized nitroxide with a maximum splitting of 62 G. The spectrum of V bound to avidin was independent of both time and the amount of bound label. The rate of dissociation of V from a 4:1 complex with avidin was monophasic. A model is proposed in which the recognition site for the heterocyclic ring system of biotin is represented as a cleft located within a hydrophobic depression in the surface of avidin."
https://openalex.org/W1553966090,"A phosphohydrolase from Enterobacter aerogenes which hydrolyzes phosphate mono- and diesters has been purified approximately 50-fold to apparent homoeneity and crystallized. The enzyme is produced when the bacteria utilize phosphate diesters as sole phosphorus source. From sedimentation equilibrium experiments the molecular weight of the native enzyme is 173,000; from sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis the subunit molecular weight is 29,000, indicating that the enzyme is hexameric. The hydrolytic activity of the enzyme using both mono- and diesters is maximal at pH 5; THE Km of the enzyme for bis-p-nitrophenyl phosphate is constant from pH 5 to 8.5 whereas that for p-nitrophenyl phosphate increases about 40-fold as the pH increases over the same range. The phosphodiesterase activity is not inhibited by chelating agents but is inhibited by several divalent metal ions. 31-P NMR spectroscopy was used to identify the hydrolysis products of glycoside cyclic phosphates. The enzyme-catalyzed hydrolysis of methyl beta-D-ribofuranoside cyclic 3:5-phosphate yields exclusively the 5-phosphate whereas that of adenosine 3:5-monophosphate yields a 4:1 mixture of 3- and 5- AMP."
https://openalex.org/W1495503112,"Protein kinase activity in homogenates of control thyroid slices and those incubated with thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) and prostaglandin EI was assayed and correlated with changes in cyclic adenosine 3':5'-monophosphate (cAMP) concentrations and binding of [3H]cAMP. Both TSH and prostaglandin E1 (25 mug/ml) increased protein kinase activity and the activity ratio (expressed as activity - cAMP to activity plus cAMP). It is unlikely that such activation reflects effects of the increased cAMP liberated at the time of homogenization. Hormone-induced activation of protein kinase persisted even after the homogenate had been diluted so that its cAMP concentration would be insufficient to achieve maximal activation of the enzyme. In contrast to the previous results of J. D. Corbin, T. R. Soderling, and C. R. Park ((1973 J. Biol. Chem. 248, 1813) using adipose tissue, homogenization of thyroid tissue in 0.5 M NaCl and chromatography using Sephadex G-100 did not seem to stabilize dissociation of protein kinase into its receptor and catalytic subunits. However, increasing amounts of NaCl in the homogenizing buffer were associated with an increase in the cAMP independence of enzyme activity. Dilution of the homogenate did not change the protein kinase activity ratio whether the homogenizing buffer contained NcCl or not. Increasing concentrations of NaF inhibited protein kinase activity. Within 1 to 3 min of incubation of thyroid slices with TSH, protein kinase activity and the activity ratio were increased significantly. This correlated quite well with increased cAMP concentrations in the slices and inhibition of [3H]cAMP binding to the homogenates. Maximal activation of the enzyme was achieved by 10 min which corresponds to the time of maximal effect on cAMP concentrations. Activation of protein kinase was achieved by 0.125 milliunit/ml of TSH and maximal effects with 0.5 to 1.25 milliunits/ml. These amounts agree well with those required for other effects of TSH. Although larger amounts of TSH produced even greater increases in cAMP concentrations this was not always associated with augmented inhibition of [3H]cAMP binding. These results are compatible with the concept that the TSH-mediated increase in cAMP is associated with activation of protein kinase in the intact cell. They also suggest that not all of the intracellular cAMP is available for activation of protein kinase."

https://openalex.org/W1500703233,"Synthesis and turnover of the main structural protein (P73) of intracisternal A-particles were studied in mouse neuroblastoma cells in tissue culture. Triton X-100:EDTA-insoluble pellets containing 95% of the A-particle antigen in the cells were prepared and analyzed by electrophoresis in Na dodecyl-SO4-minus polyacrylamide gels. A 73,000 molecular weight component was prominent in pellets from three lines of neuroblastoma which contain numerous A-particles and this component was identified as the A-particle structural protein P73. It was absent in pellets prepared from cells which do not contain A-particles. Incorporation of labeled amino acids into P73 represented approximately 1.2% of total cell incorporation and this proportion did not change when the cell growth changed from log phase to stationary phase. Label appeared P73 within 2 min after radioactive amino acids were added to the medium. Pulse-chase and inhibitor studies confirmed antigenic measurements in demonstrating that the pool of P73 not assembled into A-particles was small. Turnover studies showed that P73 gained and lost label more rapidly than the average cell protein. In one cell line which was thoroughly characterized, approximately 60% of the main A-particle protein was estimated to turn over in a 24-hour period. Although the cells released approximately 10% of the proteins synthesized into the culture fluid, A-particle protein did not appear to be released. Analysis of culture fluid failed to reveal A-particles, soluble A-particle proteins, or A-particle antigen. It appears, therefore, that the particles are relatively rapidly synthesized and degraded, and that turnover occurs entirely intracellularly."
https://openalex.org/W1967709520,"By use of an immunofluorescent cytochemical staining technique, adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate (cyclic AMP) has been localized in toad bladder epithelial cells. Within 2 minutes after addition of vasopressin, staining intensity increases in both mitochondria-rich and granular cells. This finding, taken together with the precise anatomical relation between these two epithelial cell types and the observation that after separation of the two cell types vasopressin stimulates cyclic AMP accumulation in only mitochondria-rich cells, suggests that cyclic AMP may be transferred from mitochrondria-rich to granular cells as part of the response of the toad urinary bladder to vasopressin."

https://openalex.org/W2007979206,"In this article, we describe two distinct effects of cycloheximide (CH), a potent inhibitior of protein synthesis, on the replication of polyoma virus (PV) DNA in an inducible line of PV-transformed rat cells (LPT cells). Exposure of LPT cells to CH causes up to an 8 fold increase in the cellular concentration of PV DNA determined by molecular hybridization. The same treatment inhibits cell division and chromosomal DNA replication. However, the amount of chromosomal DNA per cell is not affected by the drug. In LPT cells treated with mitomycin C (MMC), PV DNA replication is enhanced after 7 hr. During the period extending from 7 hr to 24 hr, the concentration of virus DNA increases at least 100 fold. CH added to the cells 0-7 hr after treatment with MMC inhibits the replication of PV DNA by 90-100%. The inhibition is less effective in cells exposed to CH from 7 hr and on. The inhibitory effect is reversible: virus DNA synthesis is resumed after removal of CH from the growth medium. Thus CH acts as an inducer of virus DNA synthesis in cells whose resident viral genome is repressed, but inhibits the autonomous replication of the activated genome following induction with MMC."
https://openalex.org/W1603557977,"We have perfused isolated rat livers with hypocalcemic (4.4 mg 100 ml) Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate albumin buffer. After 15 min of perfusion, a substance appeared in the perfusate which decreased rat renal adenylate cyclase activation by parathyroid hormone (PTH). The material in the perfusate was purified greater than 50,000-fold by Bio-Gel P-10 chromatography. The purified antagonist decreased the activation of rat renal cortical adenylate cyclase by PTH, glucagon, and epinephrine 75 to 100%. Concentration response curves for each of the hormones indicated a noncompetitive interaction of the inhibitor with the hormone. The inhibition was not species-specific, as the activation of the parathyroid hormone-responsive adenylate cyclase in cat renal cortex was also abolished by the inhibitor from the perfused rat liver. The inhibitor is a peptide, Mr equal to similar to 1000, which is heat-stable, acid-stable, alkai-labile, and is destroyed by trypsin, leucine aminopeptidase, and elastase. It is not destroyed by phosphodiesterase, 5'-nucleotidase, alkaline phosphatase, neuraminidase, RNase, or phospholipase A. The inhibitor is not produced by isolated rat livers perfused with normocalcemic perfusion media. It is unclear whether the peptide is synthesized by the liver or whether it is a breakdown product of a larger peptide or protein in the liver. This is the first reported peptide inhibitor of adenylate cyclase."

https://openalex.org/W1911139910,"The addition of saturating concentrations of NAD-+ and alcohol to liver alcohol dehydrogenase in a stopped flow fluorimeter results in a triphasic quenching of enzyme fluorescence. A rapid quenching occurs with a rate constant of 300 to 500 s-minus 1, followed by a slower reaction at 50 to 100 s-minus 1, and ultimately followed by a very slow reaction. The addition of NAD-+ to enzyme in the absence of substrate causes a rapid quenching of enzyme fluorescence at 300 to 500 s-minus 1, with the same amplitude as the rapid phase in the presence of substrate. These studies demonstrate that NAD-+ binding to liver alcohol dehydrogenase causes a conformational change at a rate compatible with the previously reported rate constant for proton release, indicating that proton release is probably coupled to the conformational change."

https://openalex.org/W1620813757,"Cultures of mutant cni-1, a chromosomal mutant of Neurospora crassa, undergo a marked change in respiratory properties as the age of the culture increases. Early log phase cultures have a high level of respiration that is insensitive to inhibition by cyanide or antimycin A. Late log and stationary phase cultures have reduced rates of respiration. A high percentage of this respiration is inhibited by cyanide. Mitochondria from early log phase cni-1 have an excess of cytochrome c and little or no detectable cytochrome aa3. Mitochondria from late log and stationary phase cultures have levels of c-, b-, and a-type cytochromes that are not significantly different in concentration from those found in wild type cells. The cytochrome aa3 content and the cytochrome oxidase activity of cni-1 mitochondria increase 5- to 10-fold as the age of the culture increases. Mitochondria from early log phase cells of cni-1 synthesize only polypeptides of apparent molecular weights 7,000 to 10,000 and donot synthesize any of the mitochondrial components of cytochrome oxidase. Mitochondria from late log and stationary phase cells synthesize the normal complement of mitochondrial translation products including the mitochondrial components of cytochrome oxidase. The assembly of cytochrome oxidase is likely due to the availability of the mitochondrially synthesized components of the enzyme. The regulation of mitochondrial translation in the cni-1 mutant is independent of the nutrient content of the growth medium and is due to the accumulation or depletion of some component within the cell."
