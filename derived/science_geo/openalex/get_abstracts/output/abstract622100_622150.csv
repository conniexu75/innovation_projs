https://openalex.org/W2898631010,"We report the first case series of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI)-associated colitis successfully treated with fecal microbiota transplantation, with reconstitution of the gut microbiome and a relative increase in the proportion of regulatory T-cells within the colonic mucosa. These preliminary data provide evidence that modulation of the gut microbiome may abrogate ICI-associated colitis."
https://openalex.org/W2898901335,"Multiple sclerosis (MS) is characterized by an immune system attack targeting myelin, which is produced by oligodendrocytes (OLs). We performed single-cell transcriptomic analysis of OL lineage cells from the spinal cord of mice induced with experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), which mimics several aspects of MS. We found unique OLs and OL precursor cells (OPCs) in EAE and uncovered several genes specifically alternatively spliced in these cells. Surprisingly, EAE-specific OL lineage populations expressed genes involved in antigen processing and presentation via major histocompatibility complex class I and II (MHC-I and -II), and in immunoprotection, suggesting alternative functions of these cells in a disease context. Importantly, we found that disease-specific oligodendroglia are also present in human MS brains and that a substantial number of genes known to be susceptibility genes for MS, so far mainly associated with immune cells, are expressed in the OL lineage cells. Finally, we demonstrate that OPCs can phagocytose and that MHC-II-expressing OPCs can activate memory and effector CD4-positive T cells. Our results suggest that OLs and OPCs are not passive targets but instead active immunomodulators in MS. The disease-specific OL lineage cells, for which we identify several biomarkers, may represent novel direct targets for immunomodulatory therapeutic approaches in MS."

The aim was to investigate the effect of fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) on gut microbiota and the symptoms in patients with IBS. Material and methods The study included 13 IBS patients according to Rome III criteria and 13 healthy donors. Freshly donated feces were administered to the descending part of the duodenum via a gastroscope. Feces were collected from donors and patients before FMT, and from the patients at 1, 3 and 12 weeks and donors and patients at 20/28 weeks after FMT. Microbiota analysis was performed using GA-map Dysbiosis test (Genetic Analysis AS, Oslo, Norway). The patients completed the following questionnaires before and at the aforementioned weeks after FMT: IBS Symptom Questionnaire (IBS-SQ), IBS-Symptom Severity Scoring system (IBS-SSS), Short Form of Nepean Dyspepsia Index (SF-NDI), Bristol stool form scale, the Eysenck Personality Questionnaire-Neuroticism and Hospital Anxiety and Depression. Results Donors and IBS patients had significantly different bacterial strain signals before FMT (Ruminococcus gnavus, Actinobacteria and Bifidobacteria) that became non-significant after 3 weeks following FMT. The changes in gut microbiota were similar between donors and patients at 20/28 weeks after FMT. Thus, patients’ microbiota profiles became more-or-less similar to donors. The scores of all the questionnaires were significantly improved at all time points following FMT. No reported adverse effects. Conclusions FMT was associated with a change in gut microbiota and improvement in IBS symptoms and quality of life lasting for up to 28 weeks. Trial registration ClinicalTrials.gov ID: NCT03333291"
https://openalex.org/W2803657551,"In this study, differences in the ruminal bacterial community between high-yield and low-yield lactating dairy cows under the same dietary conditions were investigated. Sixteen lactating dairy cows with similar parity and days in milk were divided into high-yield (HY) and low-yield (LY) groups based on their milk yield. On day 21, rumen content samples were collected, and their microbiota compositions were determined using high-throughput sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene by the Illumina MiSeq platform. During the study period, dry matter intake (DMI) and milk yield were measured daily, and milk composition was assessed 3 times per week. The results showed that the milk of the LY group tended to have higher fat (P = 0.08), protein (P = 0.01) and total solid contents (P = 0.04) than that of the HY group, while the HY group had higher ruminal propionate (P = 0.08) proportion and volatile fatty acid (VFA) (P = 0.02) concentrations. Principal coordinate analysis indicated significant differences in ruminal bacterial community compositions and structures between the HY group and LY group. The abundances of Ruminococcus 2, Lachnospiraceae and Eubacterium coprostanoligenes were significantly higher in the HY group than in the LY group. In addition, Bacteroides, Ruminococcus 2 and Candidatus-Saccharimonas were positively correlated with ruminal propionate proportion (r>0.4, P<0.05). These findings enhance the understanding of bacterial synthesis within the rumen and reveal an important mechanism underlying differences in milk production in dairy cows."
https://openalex.org/W2900954040,"Perilipin 2 (PLIN2) is a major lipid droplet (LD)-associated protein that regulates intracellular lipid homeostasis and LD formation. Under lipid-deprived conditions, the LD-unbound (free) form of PLIN2 is eliminated in the cytosol by an as yet unknown ubiquitin (Ub)-proteasome pathway that is associated with the N-terminal or near N-terminal residues of the protein. Here, using HeLa, HEK293T, and HepG2 human cell lines, cycloheximide chase, in vivo ubiquitylation, split-Ub yeast two-hybrid, and chemical cross-linking–based reciprocal co-immunoprecipitation assays, we found that TEB4 (MARCH6), an E3 Ub ligase and recognition component of the Ac/N-end rule pathway, directly targets the N-terminal acetyl moiety of Nα-terminally acetylated PLIN2 for its polyubiquitylation and degradation by the 26S proteasome. We also show that the TEB4-mediated Ac/N-end rule pathway reduces intracellular LD accumulation by degrading PLIN2. Collectively, these findings identify PLIN2 as a substrate of the Ac/N-end rule pathway and indicate a previously unappreciated role of the Ac/N-end rule pathway in LD metabolism.

https://openalex.org/W2901835569,"Background Live, attenuated viral vectors that express HIV-1 antigens are being investigated as an approach to generating durable immune responses against HIV-1 in humans. We recently developed a replication-competent, highly attenuated Ad26 vector that expresses mosaic HIV-1 Env (rcAd26.MOS1.HIV-Env, “rcAd26”). Here we present the results of a first-in-human, placebo-controlled clinical trial to test the safety, immunogenicity and mucosal shedding of rcAd26 given orally. Methods Healthy adults were randomly assigned to receive a single oral dose of vaccine or placebo at 5:1 ratio in a dosage escalation of 10^8 to 10^11 rcAd26 VP (nominal doses) at University of Rochester Medical Center, Rochester, NY, USA. Participants were isolated and monitored for reactogenicity for 10 days post-vaccination, and adverse events were recorded up to day 112. Rectal and oropharyngeal secretions were evaluated for shedding of the vaccine. Humoral and cellular immune responses were measured. Household contacts were monitored for secondary vaccine transmission. Results We enrolled 22 participants and 11 household contacts between February 7 and June 24, 2015. 18 participants received one dose of HIV-1 vaccine and 4 participants received placebo. The vaccine caused only mild to moderate adverse events. No vaccine-related SAEs were observed. No infectious rcAd26 viral particles were detected in rectal or oropharyngeal secretions from any participant. Env-specific ELISA and ELISPOT responses were undetectable. No household contacts developed vaccine-induced HIV-1 seropositivity or vaccine-associated illness. Conclusions The highly attenuated rcAd26.MOS1.HIV-Env vaccine was well tolerated up to 10^11 VP in healthy, HIV-1-uninfected adults, though the single dose was poorly immunogenic suggesting the replicative capacity of the vector was too attenuated. There was no evidence of shedding of infectious virus or secondary vaccine transmission following the isolation period. These data suggest the use of less attenuated viral vectors in future studies of live, oral HIV-1 vaccines. Trial registration ClinicalTrials.gov NCT02366013."
https://openalex.org/W2901257608,"Uncertainty in illness is regarded as a source of stress in many chronic diseases and is negatively related to health-related quality of life (HRQoL). However, studies on the relationship between uncertainty and HRQoL in patients with heart failure are limited. This study used Mishel's theory of uncertainty in illness to investigate the mediating role of uncertainty in illness and depressive symptoms between symptom distress and HRQoL in patients with heart failure. This study used a cross-sectional correlation design. Participants were recruited by convenience sampling from outpatient services and medical wards of cardiology departments of a medical center in northern Taiwan. Data were collected for uncertainty, depressive symptoms, symptoms distress of heart failure, and HRQoL using self-report questionnaires. Demographics and clinical characteristics were analyzed with descriptive statistics. The mutual effects of disease characteristics, symptom distress, uncertainty in illness, depressive symptoms and HRQoL, as well as the overall model fitness, were analyzed by with structural equation modeling. We collected 147 qualified questionnaires. The mean score for the Mishel Uncertainty in Illness Scale for patients with heart failure was 73.5 (SD = 18.55); 65.3% of participants had a score of ≧13 on the Beck Depressive Inventory-II, indicating mild depression. Uncertainty, depressive symptoms, and HRQoL were directly related to symptom distress. Symptom distress and depressive symptoms were both mediators between uncertainty and depressive symptoms. Depressive symptoms also mediated emotional support and HRQoL. Uncertainty and depressive symptoms were important factors in the pathway between symptom distress and HRQoL for heart failure patients. We suggest providing heart failure patients with tailored interventions for effective self-management of symptoms based on Mishel's theory of uncertainty in illness, which could help control disease symptoms, alleviate uncertainty and depression as well as improve HRQoL."
https://openalex.org/W2901789388,"Background The incidence of tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) varies significantly over time. To better understand the annual incidence of all TBE cases in Latvia we investigated the disease burden in the country from 1973–2016 using several available sources and case definitions. Methods We identified cases of TBE from an electronic database (maintained by the Centre for Disease Prevention and Control of Latvia [CDPC]) by the use of ICD-10 diagnosis codes for TBE (A84; A84.0; A84.1; A84.8; A84.9). In addition, previously unreported TBE cases were found by review of TBE diagnoses according to ICD-10 codes in four hospital databases. Results From 1973 to 2016 a total of 15,193 TBE cases were reported to the CDPC, 2,819 of which were reported from January 2007 through December 2016, additionally for this time period, 104 cases were identified via hospital survey. From all 2,923 reported cases (2007–2016), 1,973 met TBE case definition criteria and were included in the TBE study analysis. The highest average 10 year incidence was observed from 1990–1999 (27.9 cases per 100,000; range 4.6–53.0), however, the average 10-year incidence from 2007–2016 using officially adopted TBE case definition was 9.6 cases per 100,000 (range 5.8–14.6). For this 10-year time period most cases were adults (95.1%) and male (52.2%). The most common clinical form of TBE was meningitis (90.6%). A tick bite prior to TBE onset was reported in 60.6% of TBE cases and 98.2% of cases were not vaccinated against TBE. Conclusion The data demonstrate that the incidence of TBE varies by about one third based on the case definition used. TBE occurs almost entirely in the unvaccinated population. Regular TBE awareness campaigns could encourage the population in Latvia to use protective measures to further control TBE in the country, either via vaccination or tick avoidance."
https://openalex.org/W2901765154,"Human cytochrome P450 11B1 (CYP11B1) is responsible for the final step generating the steroid hormone cortisol, which controls stress and immune responses and glucose homeostasis. CYP11B1 is a promising drug target to manage Cushing’s disease, a disorder arising from excessive cortisol production. However, the design of selective inhibitors has been hampered because structural information for CYP11B1 is unavailable and the enzyme has high amino acid sequence identity (93%) to a closely related enzyme, the aldosterone-producing CYP11B2. Here we report the X-ray crystal structure of human CYP11B1 (at 2.1 Å resolution) in complex with fadrozole, a racemic compound normally used to treat breast cancer by inhibiting estrogen-producing CYP19A1. Comparison of fadrozole-bound CYP11B1 with fadrozole-bound CYP11B2 revealed that despite conservation of the active-site residues, the overall structures and active sites had structural rearrangements consistent with distinct protein functions and inhibition. Whereas fadrozole binds to both CYP11B enzymes by coordinating the heme iron, CYP11B2 binds to the R enantiomer of fadrozole, and CYP11B1 binds to the S enantiomer, each with distinct orientations and interactions. These results provide insights into the cross-reactivity of drugs across multiple steroidogenic cytochrome P450 enzymes, provide a structural basis for understanding human steroidogenesis, and pave the way for the design of more selective inhibitors of each human CYP11B enzyme.

https://openalex.org/W2900837118,"Riparian habitats have been frequently identified as priority areas for conservation under climate change because they span climatic gradients and have cool, moist microclimates relative to surrounding areas. They are therefore expected to act as dispersal corridors for climate-induced species range shifts and to provide microclimatic refugia from warming. Despite recognition of these values, rigorous methods to identify which riparian areas are most likely to facilitate range shifts and provide refugia are currently lacking. We completed a novel analysis across the Pacific Northwest, USA, that identifies potential riparian corridors featuring characteristics expected to enhance their ability to facilitate range shifts and provide refugia. These features include large temperature gradients, high canopy cover, large relative width, low exposure to solar radiation, and low levels of human modification. These variables were used to calculate a riparian climate-corridor index using a multi-scale approach that incorporates results ranging in scale from local watersheds to the entire Pacific Northwest. Resulting index values for potential riparian corridors in the Pacific Northwest were highest within mountainous areas and lowest within relatively flat, lowland regions. We also calculated index values within ecoregions, to better identify high-value riparian climate corridors within the relatively flat, degraded areas where they may most contribute to climate adaptation. We found that high-value riparian climate-corridors are least protected in flat, lowland areas, suggesting that such corridors should be high priorities for future conservation effort. Our analysis provides critical information on valuable riparian climate-corridors to guide climate adaptation efforts (and riparian management and restoration efforts) in the Pacific Northwest, while offering a novel approach that may be applied to similar efforts in other geographies."
https://openalex.org/W2901718336,"Inflammation and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress are hallmarks of metabolic syndrome. While these metabolic derangements have been well-investigated in white adipose tissue, their existence and etiology in brown adipose tissue (BAT) are poorly understood. Here, we aimed to investigate ER homeostasis and the inflammatory status and of BAT lacking uncoupling protein-1 (UCP1), a protein required for BAT thermogenesis. H&E staining illustrated lipid accumulation and crown-like structures surrounding adipocytes in BAT of UCP1-/- mice housed at room temperature compared to control mice. Further, immunohistological evaluation of F4/80 and gene expression studies demonstrated BAT macrophage infiltration and robust elevation of pro-inflammatory markers in UCP1-/- BAT. ER stress was also present in BAT of UCP1-/- mice, as evidenced by elevated gene expression and post-translational modifications of unfolded protein response components. After four weeks of thermoneutral housing, UCP1-/- mice did not exhibit elevated BAT inflammation and ER stress gene expression compared to WT mice, but depot expansion persisted. Collectively, we demonstrate that the effects of UCP1 deficiency in BAT are not restricted to mitochondrial uncoupling. We conclude that brown adipose tissue of UCP1-/- mice exhibits pro-inflammatory immune cell infiltration and perturbations in ER homeostasis and that this phenotype is driven by cold exposure rather than lipid accumulation."
https://openalex.org/W2900599466,"NADH–quinone oxidoreductase (respiratory complex I) couples NADH-to-quinone electron transfer to the translocation of protons across the membrane. Even though the architecture of the quinone-access channel in the enzyme has been modeled by X-ray crystallography and cryo-EM, conflicting findings raise the question whether the models fully reflect physiologically relevant states present throughout the catalytic cycle. To gain further insights into the structural features of the binding pocket for quinone/inhibitor, we performed chemical biology experiments using bovine heart sub-mitochondrial particles. We synthesized ubiquinones that are oversized (SF–UQs) or lipid-like (PC–UQs) and are highly unlikely to enter and transit the predicted narrow channel. We found that SF–UQs and PC–UQs can be catalytically reduced by complex I, albeit only at moderate or low rates. Moreover, quinone-site inhibitors completely blocked the catalytic reduction and the membrane potential formation coupled to this reduction. Photoaffinity-labeling experiments revealed that amiloride-type inhibitors bind to the interfacial domain of multiple core subunits (49 kDa, ND1, and PSST) and the 39-kDa supernumerary subunit, although the latter does not make up the channel cavity in the current models. The binding of amilorides to the multiple target subunits was remarkably suppressed by other quinone-site inhibitors and SF–UQs. Taken together, the present results are difficult to reconcile with the current channel models. On the basis of comprehensive interpretations of the present results and of previous findings, we discuss the physiological relevance of these models.

In this context, it is important to note that the channel in the static state was postulated to undergo structural rearrangement to allow UQs to move into and out of the channel because the planar quinone head-ring is wider (∼6 Å across) than the diameter of the entry point (5Baradaran R. Berrisford J.M. Minhas G.S. Sazanov L.A.

First, we examined whether complex I catalyzes the reduction of oversized or lipid-like UQs (SF–UQs and PC–UQs, respectively, Fig. 1), which are highly unlikely to enter and transit the predicted channel (∼30 Å long) due to extensive physical restrictions. Second, because the photoreactive amiloride PRA1 (Fig. 2) was shown to label a supernumerary subunit (not a core subunit) (17Murai M. Murakami S. Ito T. Miyoshi H. Amilorides bind to the quinone binding pocket of bovine mitochondrial complex I.Biochemistry. 2015; 54 (25849763): 2739-274610.1021/acs.biochem.5b00187Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), the binding positions of a series of amiloride-type inhibitors were further investigated by a photoaffinity labeling technique. The reasons why we selected these two subjects are as follows.Figure 2Structures of photoreactive amilorides synthesized in this study. PRA1 and PRA2 used in our previous work (17Murai M. Murakami S.

Given this convincing experiment to verify the physiological relevance of the models may prove that the enzyme is indeed unable to catalyze the reduction of UQs, which are incapable of reaching the reaction site for some physical reason. Therefore, to prevent the quinone head-ring from reaching the reaction site by physical factors, we synthesized two types of UQs: oversized UQs that have a bulky “block” in the terminus of the short side chain (SF–UQs, Fig. 1) and a hybrid of phosphatidylcholine (PC) and UQ (PC–UQs, Fig. 1), in which the UQ head-ring is attached to the terminus of the sn-2 acyl chain. Detailed design concepts for these UQs are described at the beginning of “Results.” Concerning the second subject, amiloride-type inhibitors were once considered to bind to any or all Na+/H+-antiporter–like subunits of complex I (i.e. the ND2, ND4, and ND5 subunits) (19Nakamaru-Ogiso E.

However, we previously demonstrated using a photoaffinity-labeling technique that amilorides do not bind to any of the antiporter-like subunits; they specifically bind to the interface of the hydrophilic and membrane arms (17Murai M.

Amilorides bind to the quinone binding pocket of bovine mitochondrial complex I.Biochemistry. 2015; 54 (25849763): 2739-274610.1021/acs.biochem.5b00187Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). To be more specific, the photoreactive amilorides PRA1 and PRA2 (Fig. 2), which are very similar in structure, but possess a photolabile azido (−N=N+=N−) group at the opposite ends of their molecules, are labeled the B14.5a supernumerary and 49-kDa core subunits, respectively. Because quinone-site inhibitors are considered to enter the channel irrespective of different chemical frameworks (5Baradaran R. Berrisford J.M. Minhas G.S. Sazanov L.A.

Because the entire structural model of mammalian complex I was unavailable when we published our previous study (17Murai M. Murakami S. Ito T. Miyoshi H. Amilorides bind to the quinone binding pocket of bovine mitochondrial complex I.Biochemistry. 2015; 54 (25849763): 2739-274610.1021/acs.biochem.5b00187Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), further intensive studies to characterize the unique action manner of amilorides are needed. On addressing this task, it should be mentioned that advances were achieved in the syntheses of amilorides after the publication of our previous study (17Murai M. Murakami S. Ito T. Miyoshi H. Amilorides bind to the quinone binding pocket of bovine mitochondrial complex I.Biochemistry. 2015; 54 (25849763): 2739-274610.1021/acs.biochem.5b00187Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). We succeeded in producing ∼10-fold more potent amilorides (amide-type) than PRA1 and PRA2 (guanidine-type) and establishing a synthetic procedure to incorporate radioactive 125I into amilorides as a detection tag. These advances together have ensured that the photoaffinity labeling experiments are conducted with the lowest possible concentrations of photoreactive amilorides (<10 nm), which are <1/100 of the concentrations of PRA1 and PRA2 used previously. This advantage must minimize the probability of nonspecific labeling, which is a primary cause of false-positive results. The first set of experiments conducted in this study revealed that oversized SF–UQs and lipid-like PC–UQs can accept electrons from the physiological reaction site of UQ. The second set of experiments showed that amilorides bind at the interfacial domain of multiple core subunits (49 kDa, ND1, and PSST) and the 39-kDa supernumerary subunit, although 39 kDa does not make up the channel cavity in the current models. These results are difficult to explain by the channel models. On the basis of the comprehensive interpretations of the present results and previous findings (15Masuya T. Murai M. Morisaka H.

Tobacco is a versatile model plant organism for studying RKNs-host interactions and a key plant material for molecular research. Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) play critical roles in post transcriptional and transcriptional regulation in a wide range of biological pathways, especially plant development and stress response. In the present study, we obtained 5,206 high-confidence lncRNAs based on RNA sequencing data. Gene Ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway analyses revealed that the target genes of these lncRNAs are mainly involved in plant biotic and abiotic stresses, plant hormone signal transduction, induced systemic resistance, plant-type hypersensitive response, plant-type cell wall organization or biogenesis. The 565 differentially expressed lncRNAs found to be involved in nematode stress response were validated by quantitative PCR using 15 randomly-selected lncRNA genes. Our study provides insights into the molecular mechanisms of RKNs-plant interactions that might help preventing nematode damages to crops."

In the sequence context of plant EPSPSs, alanine in place of glycine at the equivalent position interferes with the binding of both glyphosate and PEP. We show here that iterative optimization of maize EPSPS containing the G101A substitution yielded variants on par with CP4 in terms of catalytic activity in the presence of glyphosate. The improvement relative to G101A alone was entirely due to reduction in Km for PEP from 333 to 18 μm, versus 9.5 μm for native maize EPSPS. A large portion of the reduction in Km was conferred by two down-sizing substitutions (L97C and V332A) within 8 Å of glyphosate, which together reduced Km for PEP to 43 μm. Although the original optimization was conducted with maize EPSPS, contextually homologous substitutions conferred similar properties to the EPSPSs of other crops. We also discovered a variant having the known glyphosate-desensitizing substitution P106L plus three additional ones that reduced the Km for PEP from 47 μm, observed with P106L alone, to 10.3 μm.

https://openalex.org/W2900568384,"Biofilms are often observed at the solid-water interface. The leaves of many floating macrophytes have characteristics of both terrestrial plants and submerged macrophytes, because, in general, their upper and lower surfaces are exposed to air and water, respectively. However, little is known about the biofilms attached to floating plants. We investigated biofilms attached to the leaves, stems and roots of the floating plants Nymphoides peltata (in summer and winter) and Trapa natans (in summer) in the Gonghu Bay of Lake Taihu. Bacteria and algae were major components of the biofilm on the leaves of the two species of plants. In addition, 454 pyrosequencing analysis of bacterial 16S rRNA genes revealed that Proteobacteria was the dominant phylum, followed by Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes, Chloroflexi, Acidobacteria, and Verrucomicrobia. Cluster analysis showed that bacterial communities from the same plant source were clustered into the same group. A total of 677 genera were detected, and 47 genera were shared by all samples. Nitrifiers, including Nitrosomonas, Nitrosococcus and Nitrospira were detected in this study. Seven denitrifying genes (napA, napG, nirS, nirK, cnorB, qnorB and nosZ) were used to detect the abundance of denitrifiers. Genes nirK, nirS cnorB and nosZ were the four most abundant genes in all samples. Our results demonstrated that cultivation of floating plants in water column could enlarge the area for biofilm growth, and biofilms might play an important role in denitrification in eutrophic water."
https://openalex.org/W2901622578,"Teredinidae are a family of highly adapted wood-feeding and wood-boring bivalves, commonly known as shipworms, whose evolution is linked to the acquisition of cellulolytic gammaproteobacterial symbionts harbored in bacteriocytes within the gills. In the present work we applied metagenomics to characterize microbiomes of the gills and digestive tract of Neoteredo reynei, a mangrove-adapted shipworm species found over a large range of the Brazilian coast. Comparative metagenomics grouped the gill symbiont community of different N. reynei specimens, indicating closely related bacterial types are shared. Similarly, the intestine and digestive gland communities were related, yet were more diverse than and showed no overlap with the gill community. Annotation of assembled metagenomic contigs revealed that the gill symbiotic community of N. reynei encodes a plethora of plant cell wall polysaccharides degrading glycoside hydrolase encoding genes, and Biosynthetic Gene Clusters (BGCs). In contrast, the digestive tract microbiomes seem to play little role in wood digestion and secondary metabolites biosynthesis. Metagenome binning recovered the nearly complete genome sequences of two symbiotic Teredinibacter strains from the gills, a representative of Teredinibacter turnerae ""clade I"" strain, and a yet to be cultivated Teredinibacter sp. type. These Teredinibacter genomes, as well as un-binned gill-derived gammaproteobacteria contigs, also include an endo-β-1,4-xylanase/acetylxylan esterase multi-catalytic carbohydrate-active enzyme, and a trans-acyltransferase polyketide synthase (trans-AT PKS) gene cluster with the gene cassette for generating β-branching on complex polyketides. Finally, we use multivariate analyses to show that the secondary metabolome from the genomes of Teredinibacter representatives, including genomes binned from N. reynei gills' metagenomes presented herein, stands out within the Cellvibrionaceae family by size, and enrichments for polyketide, nonribosomal peptide and hybrid BGCs. Results presented here add to the growing characterization of shipworm symbiotic microbiomes and indicate that the N. reynei gill gammaproteobacterial community is a prolific source of biotechnologically relevant enzymes for wood-digestion and bioactive compounds production."

Recent studies have unraveled additional pivotal roles of the LBD protein family beyond defining lateral organ boundaries, such as pollen development and nitrogen metabolism. The structural basis for the molecular network of LBD-dependent processes remains to be deciphered. Here, we solved the first structure of the homodimeric LOB domain of Ramosa2 from wheat (TtRa2LD) to 1.9 Å resolution. Our crystal structure reveals structural features shared with other zinc-finger transcriptional factors, as well as some features unique to LBD proteins. Formation of the TtRa2LD homodimer relied on hydrophobic interactions of its coiled-coil motifs. Several specific motifs/domains of the LBD protein were also involved in maintaining its overall conformation. The intricate assembly within and between the monomers determined the precise spatial configuration of the two zinc fingers that recognize palindromic DNA sequences. Biochemical, molecular modeling, and small-angle X-ray scattering experiments indicated that dimerization is important for cooperative DNA binding and discrimination of palindromic DNA through a molecular calipers mechanism. Along with previously published data, this study enables us to establish an atomic-scale mechanistic model for LBD proteins as transcriptional regulators in plants.

LBD proteins are defined by a conserved Lateral Organ Boundaries (LOB) domain, which comprises a conserved CX2CX6CX3C motif (referred to as zinc finger). This domain is often followed by three conserved residues Gly–Ala–Ser (termed the GAS motif) harboring an invariant glycine residue and a C-terminal leucine zipper–like motif (LZLM). Although the zinc finger is assumed to be responsible for DNA binding, the LZLM is thought to be a protein dimerization domain because the C-terminal sequence includes five repetitions of hydrophobic amino acid residues, such as valine, isoleucine, and leucine, with six-residue intervals, and it has characteristics similar to a coiled-coil motif (20Shuai B.

To date, about 129,288 plant transcription factors from 83 species have been identified, which are classified into 58 families (31Jin J. Zhang H. Kong L. Gao G. Luo J.

However, the structure and mechanistic basis of regulation of the LBD family of transcription factors are still unsolved. In this study, we crystallized and determined the crystal structure of the LOB domain of an LBD protein from wheat. The structure mainly consists of a zinc finger, a GAS motif consisting of two α-helices, a highly conserved five-residue motif (Asp–Pro–Val–Tyr–Gly, referred to as DPVYG motif), and an amphipathic α-helix with the feature of leucine zipper–like coiled-coil element (Fig. 1). The intricate assembly within and between the monomers determines the exact spatial arrangement of the two zinc fingers through which the palindrome sequences are recognized and bound. These structural features were further confirmed by biochemical and biophysical studies. The structure, together with our molecular modeling and SAXS experiments, enables us to gain a deep insight into the structure-based mechanism for DNA-binding specificity in the LBD family of transcription factors. The LBD family proteins consist of an N-terminal LOB domain and a variable C-terminal region that regulates downstream gene expression (1Majer C. Hochholdinger F. Defining the boundaries: structure and function of LOB domain proteins.Trends Plant Sci. 2011; 16 (20961800): 47-5210.1016/j.tplants.2010.09.009Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Our phylogenetic analysis and multiple sequence alignment revealed that the LOB domain is highly conserved throughout the plant kingdom (Fig. S1). To gain insight into the structural and mechanistic basis of the functions of LBD transcription factors, we screened several LBD proteins from different species such as Arabidopsis, maize, rice, and wheat. Finally, the LOB domain of Ramosa2 from wheat (Triticum turgidum) (termed as TtRa2LD) harboring residues 17–147 was successfully expressed in Escherichia coli, purified to homogeneity, and crystallized. The structure of TtRa2LD was solved to 1.9 Å resolution by single-wavelength anomalous dispersion (SAD) using the natively-bound zinc ions (Table S1). The crystal structure shows that a dimeric TtRa2LD was crystallized in space group P21 21 21, which contains two subunits per asymmetric unit. The two identical subunits mainly fold into five α-helices, and each monomer is composed of five distinct modules as follows: a compact zinc-finger domain (residues 26–50); a GAS motif composed of two α-helices (α2 and α3, residues 51–76) that are perpendicular to each other; an α-helical coiled-coil leucine zipper element (α5, residues 102–132) that is connected to the GAS motif through α4 (residues 77–96); and the DPVYG motif (residues 97–101) (Fig. 1 and Fig. S1B). N- and C-terminal ends (residues 17–25 and 133–147, respectively) do not exhibit defined electron density, suggesting that they are disordered. Interestingly, the orientation of the α-helical dimerization element α5 is approximately perpendicular to α4, and thus the dimeric TtRa2LD globally takes a T-like form, which extends ∼72 Å in length and ∼49 Å in width (Fig. 1C). The two protein subunits of TtRa2LD dimer are related by a 2-fold noncrystallographic axis and are nearly identical with a root-mean-square deviation (r.m.s.d.) of 1.57 Å over all protein atoms (r.m.s.d. of 0.93 Å calculated over Cα atoms). At first glance, the global structure of TtRa2LD is similar to some previously solved three-dimensional structures of dimeric DNA-binding proteins, such as TFIIIA-like “zinc finger” or the steroid receptor-like DNA-binding module, but structural similarity searches with DALI (39Holm L.

Search of homologues of the separated GAS motif and zinc finger did not give significant results, indicating that the GAS motif and zinc finger folds with unique structural features. However, the coiled-coil dimerization domains are conserved and can be superimposed on the leucine zipper domains of GAL4 with an average r.m.s.d. on Cα of 1.0 Å. Superposition of TtRa2LD on the structure of GAL4 in complex with DNA (PDB code 1D66) reveals that the rest of TtRa2LD occupies the DNA position (Fig. 7A). Therefore, the structure of GAL4–DNA complex does not give clues that allow us to predict how TtRa2LD binds DNA. The zinc finger of TtRa2LD is composed of an α-helix (α1) with two extended random-coil segments at both ends (Fig. 1B). The conformation of the zinc finger is stabilized by tetrahedral coordination of a zinc ion with four conserved cysteine residues: Cys-28, Cys-31, Cys-38, and Cys-42 (Fig. 2A). As shown in the electron density map in Fig. 7B, the high resolution of 1.9 Å allows us to unambiguously identify the distances between the sulfhydryl atoms and the zinc ion: 2.41 Å (Zn-Sγ of Cys-28), 2.36 Å (Zn-Sγ of Cys-31), 2.40 Å (Zn-Sγ of Cys-38), and 2.36 Å (Zn-Sγ of Cys-42), with all the distances well within the ideal distances of zinc-binding sites in proteins (41Krishna S.S.

Superposition of TtRa2LD zinc finger on GAL4 zinc finger gives an r.m.s.d. of 1.44 Å over 16 Cα (Fig. 7C). The two zinc-finger motifs in the TtRa2LD dimer are congruent, and the distance between their centers is about 37.1 Å (Fig. 1C). To confirm the structure of the zinc finger and better understand its intrinsic properties, we quantified the Zn2+ content using 4-(2-pyridylazo)resorcinol (PAR) and the thiol group of untreated or Zn2+-extracted TtRa2LD using DTNB (48Ren H.

In addition, dialysis of TtRa2LD against DTT and EDTA removed ∼93% of the bound Zn2+ and uncovered additionally ∼4 solvent-accessible thiol groups, supporting the notion that the Zn2+-binding site is composed of ∼4 cysteines near the surface of TtRa2LD (Table 1). We next asked whether the presence of Zn2+ ion is necessary for the DNA-binding activity of TtRa2LD. We pre-incubated the protein with increasing concentrations of EDTA, and we then measured its DNA-binding activity under equilibrium conditions. The results show that the DNA-binding activity was seriously compromised at high EDTA concentrations (Fig. 2B). Furthermore, analysis of circular dichroism (CD) spectra of TtRa2LD in the far-UV region further revealed that the reduction of DNA-binding activity was accompanied by an alteration of the secondary structures with increasing EDTA concentrations (Fig. 2B), confirming that the Zn2+ ion is essential for keeping the zinc-finger configuration for efficient DNA binding. These biochemical data correlate well with the determined crystal structure of TtRa2LD.Table 1Bound Zn2+ and free thiol groups determined with TtRa2LDProtein[Protein][Zn2+]Thiolfree/proteinnmolnmolTtRa2LD0.700.68 (0.97:1)aRatio is between [Zn2+] and [protein].1.82Treated TtRa2LDbTtRa2LD protein was treated with EDTA/DTT.1.210.08 (0.07:1)5.90a Ratio is between [Zn2+] and [protein].b TtRa2LD protein was treated with EDTA/DTT.

The two α-helices are approximately perpendicular to each other and stabilized by a set of hydrophobic interactions implicated by Val-59 and His-60 of α2 and Asn-67 and Val-68 of α3, whereas Gly-64 is located at the central position of the hydrophobic core (Fig. 2C).

https://openalex.org/W2780490426,"Huntington disease (HD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease that initially affects the striatum and leads to changes in behavior and loss of motor coordination. It is caused by an expansion in the polyglutamine repeat at the N terminus of huntingtin (HTT) that leads to aggregation of mutant HTT. The loss of wild-type function, in combination with the toxic gain of function mutation, initiates various cell death pathways. Wild-type and mutant HTT are regulated by different posttranslational modifications that can positively or negatively regulate their function or toxicity. In particular, we have previously shown that caspase cleavage of mutant HTT at amino acid position aspartate 586 (D586) by caspase-6 is critical for the pathogenesis of the disease in an HD mouse model. Herein, we describe the identification of a new caspase cleavage site at position D572 that is mediated by caspase-1. Inhibition of caspase-1 also appeared to decrease proteolysis at D586, likely by blocking the downstream activation of caspase-6 through caspase-1. Inhibition of caspase cleavage at D572 significantly decreased mutant HTT aggregation and significantly increased the turnover of soluble mutant HTT. This suggests that caspase-1 may be a viable target to inhibit caspase cleavage of mutant HTT at both D572 and D586 to promote mutant HTT clearance.—Martin, D. D. O., Schmidt, M. E., Nguyen, Y.

https://openalex.org/W2901248663,"As divorce and cohabitation dissolution in the US have increased, partnering has expanded to the point that sociologists describe a merry-go-round of partners in American families. Could one driver of the increase in the number of partners be an intergenerational transmission of partnering? We discuss three theoretical perspectives on potential mechanisms that would underlie an intergenerational transmission of partnering: the transmission of economic hardship, the transmission of marriageable characteristics and relationship skills, and the transmission of relationship commitment. Using the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1979 Child and Young Adult study (NLSY79 CYA) and their mothers in the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1979 (NLSY79), we examined the intergenerational transmission of partnering, including both marital and cohabitating unions, using prospective measures of family and economic instability as well as exploiting sibling data to try to identify potential mechanisms. Even after controlling for maternal demographic characteristics and socioeconomic factors, the number of maternal partners was positively associated with offspring’s number of partners. Hybrid sibling Poisson regression models that examined sibling differential experiences of maternal partners indicated that there were no differences between siblings who witnessed more or fewer maternal partners. Overall, results suggested that the transmission of poor marriageable characteristics and relationship skills from mother to child may warrant additional attention as a potential mechanism through which the number of partners continues across generations."

Here, we describe an automated high-throughput light sheet fluorescence microscope in which specimens are positioned by and imaged within a fluidic system integrated with the sheet excitation and detection optics. We demonstrate the ability of the instrument to rapidly examine live specimens with minimal manual intervention by imaging fluorescent neutrophils over a nearly 0.3 mm3 volume in dozens of larval zebrafish. In addition to revealing considerable inter-individual variability in neutrophil number, known previously from labor-intensive methods, three-dimensional imaging allows assessment of the correlation between the bulk measure of total cellular fluorescence and the spatially resolved measure of actual neutrophil number per animal. We suggest that our simple experimental design should considerably expand the scope and impact of light sheet imaging in the life sciences."
https://openalex.org/W2900611959,"Maternal care behaviour is crucial for offspring quality and survival in pigs. Defining care is therefore essential for ensuring the welfare of pigs and sustainability of pig production. The aim of the present study was to investigate the relationship between sow nest building, communication with piglets (sniffing, nudging, grunting) during resting and activity, and piglet survival in three different sow breeds: a maternal line selected for high weaned pig production (Landrace), a paternal line selected for meat traits (Duroc), and a crossbred line (Landrace and Yorkshire). We predicted that a higher frequency of nest building and sow communication would have a positive impact on piglet survival. Secondly, we predicted that a high level of maternal care outside the time of nursing (nest building and communication) would increase the quality of the litter (weight at weaning). We also predicted that nest building activity and sow communication would be more pronounced in maternal sow lines selected for maternal traits than in a non-selected, paternal line, and that primiparous sows would perform more nest building behaviour and communicate more than multiparous sows due to high investment in their first litter. Finally, an impaired condition around farrowing (i.e. low body condition score and presence of shoulder lesions) was predicted to be negatively correlated to care behaviours. Data was collected on 38 sows with 511 born piglets. Sows with their litters, were loose-housed in individual farrowing pens until weaning. Nest building activity can be partly considered as maternal care behaviour as it prepares the sows for motherhood and is associated with a lower proportion of stillborn piglets (P < 0.001), starved piglets (P = 0.004), and overlaid piglets (P = 0.034). As predicted, sows that communicated more while being active had lower postnatal piglet mortality (starvation (P < 0.001), less overlying (P < 0.001), overlying with (P < 0.001), and without the milk in the stomach (P < 0.001) and fewer that died of other causes (P < 0.001), higher piglet survival (P < 0.001) and litter weight (P < 0.001) at weaning irrespective of the breed. A higher level of communication while active was associated with more pronounced shoulder lesions in sows (P = 0.010), suggesting a positive association between good maternal care and prevalence of shoulder lesions. We also found that resting sows that communicated more with piglets outside the time of nursing, had higher postnatal piglet mortality (P < 0.001) due to starvation (P < 0.001), overlying (P < 0.001), overlying with (P < 0.001), or without milk (P < 0.001). Communication during resting was more pronounced with increasing litter size at birth (P < 0.001), especially for thin sows (P < 0.001). Communication during resting was more pronounced in the non-selected Duroc line (P < 0.001). Our results suggest that sow communication while being active is a good predictor of good maternal care, piglet survival and litter quality in three different breeds of domestic pigs."
https://openalex.org/W2901039827,"The RNA-binding protein LIN28 is known to regulate cell fate, tissue growth, and pluripotency; however, a unified understanding of its role at the cellular level has not been achieved. Here, we address its developmental activity in mammalian postnatal neurogenesis. Constitutive expression of LIN28 in progenitor cells of the mouse subventricular zone (SVZ) caused several distinct effects: 1) the number of differentiated neurons in the olfactory bulb was dramatically reduced, whereas the relative abundance of 2 neuronal subtypes was significantly altered, 2) the population of proliferating neural progenitors in the SVZ was reduced, whereas the proportion of neuroblasts was increased, and 3) the number of astrocytes was reduced, occasionally causing them to appear early. Thus, LIN28 acts at a poststem cell/predifferentiation step, and its continuous expression caused a precocious phenotype unlike in other experimental systems. Furthermore, for the first time in a vertebrate system, we separate the majority of the biologic role of LIN28 from its known activity of blocking the microRNA let-7 by using a circular RNA sponge. We find that although LIN28 has a multifaceted role in the number and types of cells produced during postnatal neurogenesis, it appears that its action through let-7 is responsible for only a fraction of these effects.—Romer-Seibert, J.

In this study, we characterized protein N-myristoylation occurring on four human mitochondrial proteins, SAMM50, TOMM40, MIC19, and MIC25, three of which are components of the mitochondrial intermembrane space bridging (MIB) complex, which plays a critical role in the structure and function of mitochondria. In vitro and in vivo metabolic labeling experiments revealed that all four of these proteins were N-myristoylated. Analysis of intracellular localization of wild-type and non-myristoylated G2A mutants of these proteins by immunofluorescence microscopic analysis and subcellular fractionation analysis indicated that protein N-myristoylation plays a critical role in mitochondrial targeting and membrane binding of two MIB components, SAMM50 and MIC19, but not those of TOMM40 and MIC25. Immunoprecipitation experiments using specific antibodies revealed that MIC19, but not MIC25, was a major N-myristoylated binding partner of SAMM50. Immunoprecipitation experiments using a stable transformant of MIC19 confirmed that protein N-myristoylation of MIC19 is required for the interaction between MIC19 and SAMM50, as reported previously. Thus, protein N-myristoylation occurring on two mitochondrial MIB components, SAMM50 and MIC19, plays a critical role in the mitochondrial targeting and protein-protein interaction between these two MIB components."
https://openalex.org/W2900536643,"In breeding and insemination centres, significant variation in bull ejaculate quality is often observed between individuals and also within the same individual. Low-quality semen does not qualify for cryopreservation and is rejected, generating economic loss. The mechanisms underlying the formation of low-quality ejaculates are poorly understood; therefore, the aim of the present study was to investigate the proteomic differences and oxidative modifications (measured as changes in protein carbonylation level) of bull ejaculates of low and high quality. Flow cytometry and computer-assisted sperm analysis were used to assess differences in viability, reactive oxygen species (ROS) level, and sperm motility. To analyse changes in protein abundance, two-dimensional difference gel electrophoresis (2D-DIGE) was performed. Western blotting in conjunction with two-dimensional electrophoresis (2D-oxyblot) was used to quantitate carbonylated sperm proteins. Proteins were identified using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionisation time-of-flight/time-of-flight spectrometry. High quality ejaculates were characterised by higher sperm motility, viability, concentration, and a lower number of ROS-positive cells (ROS+). We found significant differences in the protein profile between high- and low-quality ejaculates, and identified 14 protein spots corresponding to 10 proteins with differences in abundance. The identified sperm proteins were mainly associated with energetic metabolism, capacitation, fertilisation, motility, and cellular detoxification. High-quality ejaculates were characterised by a high abundance of extracellular sperm surface proteins, likely due to more efficient secretion from accessory sex glands and/or epididymis, and a low abundance of intracellular proteins. Our results show that sperm proteins in low-quality ejaculates are characterised by a high carbonylation level. Moreover, we identified, for the first time, 14 protein spots corresponding to 12 proteins with differences in carbonylation level between low- and high-quality ejaculates. The carbonylated proteins were localised mainly in mitochondria or their immediate surroundings. Oxidative damage to proteins in low-quality semen may be associated with phosphorylation/dephosphorylation disturbances, mitochondrial dysfunction, and motility apparatus disorders. Our results contribute to research regarding the mechanism by which low- and high-quality ejaculates are formed and to the identification of sperm proteins that are particularly sensitive to oxidative damage."

Recently, CP was also found to function as an extracellular matrix (ECM) component in crayfish HPT (14Junkunlo K. Söderhäll K. Söderhäll I.

CP functions together with collagen, TGase, and the cytokine astakine 1 (Ast1) in the regulation of HPT progenitor cell behavior (14Junkunlo K. Söderhäll K. Söderhäll I. Clotting protein: An extracellular matrix (ECM) protein involved in crustacean hematopoiesis.Dev. Comp.

The important roles of TGase in hematopoietic regulation have been studied in detail in crayfish, and high extracellular TGase activity mediates the interaction of progenitor cells with the environment to maintain cells in an undifferentiated stage in crayfish HPT (15Junkunlo K.

Furthermore, the crayfish TGase regulatory promoter region contains GATA binding motifs, as also found in the human factor XIIIa gene (16Lin X. Söderhäll K. Söderhäll I. Transglutaminase activity in the hematopoietic tissue of a crustacean, Pacifastacus leniusculus, importance in hemocyte homeostasis.BMC Immunol. 2008; 9 (18840279): 5810.1186/1471-2172-9-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). GATA is a transcription factor that plays a crucial role during hematopoietic development. GATA family proteins function in lineage specification and differentiation of hematopoietic progenitor cells (17Gao J. Chen Y.H. Peterson L.C. GATA family transcriptional factors: Emerging suspects in hematologic disorders.Exp. Hematol. Oncol. 2015; 4 (26445707): 2810.1186/s40164-015-0024-zCrossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The presence of the GATA motif in crayfish TGase genes highlights the potential roles of TGase in hematopoietic regulation like that occurring in mammals (16Lin X. Söderhäll K. Söderhäll I. Transglutaminase activity in the hematopoietic tissue of a crustacean, Pacifastacus leniusculus, importance in hemocyte homeostasis.BMC Immunol. 2008; 9 (18840279): 5810.1186/1471-2172-9-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). In this study, we focused on the roles of the TGase enzyme in controlling hematopoiesis in the crayfish, P. leniusculus. Cystamine, a small disulfide-containing molecule, was used to inhibit TGase activity in both in vivo and in vitro experiments. To examine the important role of TGase activity on hematopoiesis, we used cystamine, a reversible TGase inhibitor, to inhibit TGase activity. First, we investigated whether cystamine could inhibit TGase enzyme activity from crayfish HPT lysate. Cystamine at different final concentrations of 10 μm, 100 μm, 1 mm, and 10 mm were tested. The inhibitory efficiency of cystamine on crayfish TGase was compared with the inhibition of a purified commercial guinea pig liver TGase (Fig. 1). By using a nonradioactive microtiter plate assay, which measured TGase-mediated BPHN2 incorporation, the highest concentration of cystamine at 10 mm significantly reduced (p < 0.001) TGase activity from guinea pig compared with control (without cystamine) (Fig. 1A). At the same concentration of cystamine (p < 0.001), the remaining activity was 10% for TGase from HPT compared with the control (Fig. 1B). The remaining activity of both TGase from guinea pig and TGase from HPT was decreased in a dose-dependent manner according to the concentration of cystamine (Fig. 1, A and B). These results indicate that cystamine is efficient in inactivating crayfish TGase as well as guinea pig TGase. To investigate whether cystamine could inhibit TGase activity in HPT tissue in vivo, TGase activity in HPT tissue at 3 h post-cystamine injection was determined (Fig. 2A). A significant decrease in TGase activity in the HPT was observed (p < 0.01) in animals injected with 150 μg cystamine/g crayfish compared with those injected with crayfish phosphate-buffered saline (CPBS) (Fig. 2A). However, cystamine at a concentration of 75 μg cystamine/g only slightly inhibited TGase activity when compared with CPBS-injected animals (Fig. 2A). It is known that cystamine may have multiple mechanisms and has been reported to increase GSH production and then reduce oxidative stress–induced cell death (18Siegel M. Khosla C. Transglutaminase 2 inhibitors and their therapeutic role in disease states.Pharmacol. Ther. 2007; 115 (17582505): 232-24510.1016/j.pharmthera.2007.05.003Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). We showed previously that low ROS level induced by N-acetylcysteine injection could prolong the decrease in hemocyte numbers by increasing extracellular TGase activity, thereby maintaining the cells inside the HPT (15Junkunlo K. Söderhäll K. Söderhäll I. Noonin C. Reactive oxygen species affect transglutaminase activity and regulate hematopoiesis in a crustacean.J. Biol. Chem. 2016; 291 (27339892): 17593-1760110.1074/jbc.M116.741348Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Therefore, we examined the effect of cystamine on ROS production after TGase inhibition by cystamine injection. However, cystamine injection had no effect on the ROS level at 1 or 3 h (Fig. 2B). Thus, it seems that cystamine has a direct effect on TGase activity without interfering with ROS production. A high level of extracellular TGase activity was found in less differentiated progenitor cells residing in the crayfish HPT compared with cells migrating out of the tissue (16Lin X. Söderhäll K. Söderhäll I. Transglutaminase activity in the hematopoietic tissue of a crustacean, Pacifastacus leniusculus, importance in hemocyte homeostasis.BMC Immunol. 2008; 9 (18840279): 5810.1186/1471-2172-9-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). These results suggest the involvement of TGase activity in the regulation of hematopoiesis. Because cystamine significantly reduced TGase activity, and to verify whether TGase inhibition caused by cystamine could affect new hemocyte production, the differential hemocyte number of granular cells (GC) and semigranular cells (SGC) was determined as well as the total number of circulating hemocyte cells (THC) after inhibition of TGase activity by cystamine injection. CPBS-injected animals served as controls (Fig. 3). Two different doses of cystamine were injected into crayfish (75 μg cystamine/g and 150 μg cystamine/g), and at the higher concentration of cystamine the hemocyte numbers increased significantly at 1 h (p < 0.05 for GC; p < 0.001 for SGC and THC). The hemocyte numbers, which increased gradually from 1 to 6 h, were restored to a normal level at 24 h (Fig. 3). Injection of cystamine at 75 μg cystamine/g similarly increased the circulating hemocyte number but to a lesser extent at later time points compared with cystamine at 150 μg cystamine/g. The hemocyte numbers (GC, SGC, and THC) increased significantly at 6 h (p < 0.01 for GC and SGC; p < 0.05 for THC) and were restored to normal levels after 24 h (Fig. 3). The inhibitory effect of cystamine on TGase activity in HPT was concentration-dependent. In addition, TGase activity in HPT was not significantly different when the number of circulating hemocytes was restored to normal level at 24 h (data not shown). The results of this experiment suggest that inhibition of TGase by cystamine may stimulate the differentiation of hematopoietic progenitor cells in the HPT and then promote the release of these cells into the peripheral circulation. The cross-linking function of TGase was shown to be essential in mediating the interaction between progenitor cells with ECM proteins such as collagen and CP in crayfish (14Junkunlo K. Söderhäll K.

To determine whether the inhibition of TGase activity has an effect on hematopoietic progenitor cell proliferation, 5-bromo-2′-deoxyuridine (BrdU) incorporation was performed in HPT after cystamine injection. However, there was no clear difference in BrdU-positive cell numbers in HPT after cystamine injection (data not shown), but the number of proliferating cells (BrdU-labeled cells) in hemolymph was significantly increased in the groups injected with 75 μg cystamine/g or 150 μg cystamine/g (Fig. 4). The presence of circulating BrdU-labeled cells may indicate that newly synthesized hemocytes are released into the circulation when TGase in the HPT is inhibited. Because we did not observe a notable increase of BrdU-positive cells in the HPT, our conclusion is that inhibition of TGase activity in HPT affected progenitor cell behavior by stimulating the release of new hemocytes into the hemolymph. Cystamine injection clearly suppressed the mobility of the crayfish (Figure 5, Figure 6). Normal or CPBS-injected crayfish usually exhibit aggressive behavior (Fig. 5). This aggressive behavior includes attacking, fighting over resources, raising the claw for grabbing, and/or holding the object (Fig. 6 and Movie S1). Injection at a concentration of 75 μg cystamine/g suppressed the frequency of movements and also induced a fear response (Fig. 6 and Movie S2). A fear response is defined as a nonfighting behavior during which the animal tries to escape from resources or objects. This behavior disappeared and returned to normal aggressive behavior after 24 h (Fig. 6 and Movie S4 and S5). Interestingly, cystamine at a concentration of 150 μg/g injection clearly induced a “nonmovement” behavior (Fig. 6 and Movie S3). Crayfish injected with 150 μg cystamine/g were completely motionless or moved very little with any part of the body (Figure 5, Figure 6, and Movie S3 and S6). This immobility behavior was observed at 1 to 24 h after injection of 150 μg cystamine/g, with restoration to normal active or aggressive behavior after 96 h (Fig. 6). The behavior that we observed corresponds to TGase activity inhibition and also to the increase in circulating hemocytes after cystamine injection.Figure 6The effect of cystamine on crayfish behavior. After injection, the behavior of the individual crayfish in each group was recorded in a 3-min video at 3, 6, 24, 48, and 96 h. The pictures show in still frames from a video used to determine the different activities of crayfish after cystamine injection. The activities of crayfish in each group were compared with CPBS injected crayfish as a control. The crayfish behavior was analyzed based on their mobility, immobility, aggressiveness, and activities. 20 crayfish were used in each of these experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The balance between self-renewal and differentiation of hematopoietic progenitor cells is tightly regulated by a variety of cells and signals, which include the microenvironment or niche (20Hoffman C.M.

In crayfish, the progenitor cells are located in packed lobules or between lobules, which are surrounded by connective tissue and ECM (21Chaga O. Söderhäll K. Lignell M. The haemopoietic cells of the freshwater crayfish, Pacifastacus leniusculus.Anim. Biol. 1995; 4: 50-70Google Scholar). TGase is an abundant protein in HPT and hemocytes, particularly in SGC (16Lin X.

Furthermore, the proliferating cells residing in crayfish HPT have a high extracellular TGase activity compared with differentiated cells or cells migrating out of the tissue (16Lin X. Söderhäll K.

These results suggest the involvement of TGase enzyme activity in hematopoietic regulation. A well-known TGase inhibitor, cystamine, was used to inhibit TGase activity in crayfish HPT. Cystamine inhibits TGase by forming a mixed disulfide with the active-site thiol through a thiol–disulfide interchange mechanism (22Lorand L. Conrad S.M. Transglutaminases.Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1984; 58 (6143256): 9-3510.1007/BF00240602Crossref PubMed Scopus (659) Google Scholar). The inhibitory effect of cystamine to TGase has been characterized in many species except crustaceans. In Drosophila, cystamine treatment prevents photoreceptor degeneration and enhances neurodegeneration in a spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA3) mutant (23Lin Y. He H. Luo Y. Zhu T. Duan R. Inhibition of transglutaminase exacerbates polyglutamine-induced neurotoxicity by increasing the aggregation of mutant ataxin-3 in an SCA3 Drosophila model.Neurotox. Res. 2015; 27 (25501875): 259-26710.1007/s12640-014-9506-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). In human WI-38 lung cells, a reduction in TGase activity has been observed in a dose-dependent manner by supplementing cystamine into the culture medium (24Birckbichler P.J. Orr G.R. Patterson Jr., M.K. Conway E. Carter H.A. Increase in proliferative markers after inhibition of transglutaminase.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

In addition, cystamine at a concentration of 10 mm completely reduces TGase activity in these cells (24Birckbichler P.J. Orr G.R. Patterson Jr., M.K. Conway E. Carter H.A. Increase in proliferative markers after inhibition of transglutaminase.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1981; 78 (6117852): 5005-500810.1073/pnas.78.8.5005Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). As in human WI-38 lung cells, the addition of cystamine completely reduced the TGase activity of commercially purified guinea pig liver TGase and decreased the activity of crayfish TGase from HPT tissue to 10% of the original activity. The inhibitory effect of cystamine on TGase activity was observed in a concentration-dependent manner. The importance of TGase in hematopoietic regulation was first studied in crayfish (16Lin X.

In black tiger shrimp, Penaeus monodon, the TGase isoform I (STG I) is expressed mainly in hematopoietic tissue (25Huang C.C. Sritunyalucksana K. Söderhäll K. Song Y.L.

In crayfish, the knockdown of TGase mRNA transcript promotes HPT cell spreading in vitro (16Lin X. Söderhäll K. Söderhäll I.

We therefore investigated the number of circulating hemocytes after inhibiting TGase activity by cystamine injection. Inhibition of TGase activity by injecting 150 μg cystamine/g resulted in a gradual increase in relative hemocyte numbers (GC, SGC, and THC) from 1 to 6 h, returning to normal levels after 24 h in the circulation. The transient effect of cystamine may be because the cystamine is metabolized after injection. Cystamine has been shown to be quickly metabolized into cysteamine and then converted to cysteine, hypotaurine, and taurine, which are endogenous cellular components commonly used as building blocks for several proteins (29Gibrat C.

We analyzed the prevalence of GERD and risk factors in an area of Indonesia with low prevalence of H. pylori infection. We recruited 104 dyspeptic patients who underwent endoscopy in Surabaya. Patients were diagnosed with GERD based on the Los Angeles classification. We evaluated gastric biopsy specimens and measured serum pepsinogen levels. Interleukin polymorphisms were evaluated by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism. Of 104 patients, 56 (53.8%) were endoscopically found to have GERD, with most categorized as grade A; 48 (46.2%) were classified as non-GERD. Higher economic status, smoking, and a history of proton-pump inhibitor use significantly increased the risk of GERD. GERD Questionnaire scores showed a positive correlation with GERD (P < 0.001). An association was found between antral atrophic gastritis and GERD (P = 0.030), and patients with GERD more frequently had severe antral atrophy than nonerosive reflux disease (P = 0.018). We found an association between pepsinogen I/II levels and GERD (P = 0.047), but with low accuracy. IL-1β -511 TT and CT were predominant among the IL-1β -511 genotypes, and IL-8–251 AT and TT were predominant among the IL-8–251 genotypes. In conclusion, we found a high prevalence of GERD in an area with low prevalence of H. pylori infection, which could be associated with acid reflux. Smoking, history of proton-pump inhibitor use, and higher economic group significantly increased the risk of GERD."

Reciprocally, diabetes induces iron loading, partially attributable to elevated intestinal iron export according to a recent report. Herein, we show that iron uptake and the mRNA expression of iron importer divalent metal transporter 1 (DMT1) were significantly increased in the duodenum of streptozotocin-induced diabetic mice. Immunofluorescence staining of human intestinal biopsies revealed increased brush border membrane (BBM) and decreased cytoplasmic DMT1 expression in patients with diabetes, suggesting translocation of DMT1. This pattern of DMT1 regulation was corroborated by immunoblotting results in diabetic mice showing that BBM DMT1 expression was increased by 210%, in contrast to a 60% increase in total DMT1. PKC mediates many diabetic complications, and PKCα activity was increased in diabetic mouse intestine. Intriguingly, diabetic mice with PKCα deficiency did not show increases in iron uptake and BBM DMT1 expression. High-glucose treatment increased plasma membrane DMT1 expression via the activation of PKCα in cultured IECs. Inhibition of PKCα potentiated the ubiquitination and degradation of DMT1 protein. We further showed that high glucose suppressed membrane DMT1 internalization. These findings demonstrate that PKCα promotes microvillus membrane DMT1 expression and intestinal iron uptake, contributing to diabetic iron loading.-Zhao, L., Bartnikas, T., Chu, X., Klein, J., Yun, C., Srinivasan, S., He, P.

https://openalex.org/W2901572252,"Despite extensive DNA sequencing data derived from natural microbial communities, it remains a major challenge to identify the key evolutionary and ecological forces that shape microbial populations. We have focused on the extensive microdiversity of the cyanobacterium Synechococcus sp., which is a dominant member of the dense phototrophic biofilms in the hot springs of Yellowstone National Park. From deep amplicon sequencing of many loci and statistical analyses of these data, we showed previously that the population has undergone an unexpectedly high degree of homologous recombination, unlinking synonymous SNP-pair correlations even on intragenic length scales. Here, we analyze the genic amino acid diversity, which provides new evidence of selection and insights into the evolutionary history of the population. Surprisingly, some features of the data, including the spectrum of distances between genic-alleles, appear consistent with primarily asexual neutral drift. Yet the non-synonymous site frequency spectrum has too large an excess of low-frequency polymorphisms to result from negative selection on deleterious mutations given the distribution of coalescent times that we infer. And our previous analyses showed that the population is not asexual. Taken together, these apparently contradictory data suggest that selection, epistasis, and hitchhiking all play essential roles in generating and stabilizing the diversity. We discuss these as well as potential roles of ecological niches at genomic and genic levels. From quantitative properties of the diversity and comparative genomic data, we infer aspects of the history and inter-spring dispersal of the meta-population since it was established in the Yellowstone Caldera. Our investigations illustrate the need for combining multiple types of sequencing data and quantitative statistical analyses to develop an understanding of microdiversity in natural microbial populations."

We therefore investigated whether CTO lesion length can significantly influence6-month angiographic and 2-year clinical outcomes following successful CTO PCI.A total of 235 consecutive patients who underwent successful CTO intervention were allocated into either the long or short CTO group according to CTO lesion length. Six-month angiographic and 2-year clinical outcomes were then compared between the 2groups. We found that baseline clinical characteristics were generally similar between the 2 groups. Exceptions were prior PCI, which was more frequent in the long CTO group, and bifurcation lesions, which were more frequent in the short CTO group. Apart from intimal dissection, which was more frequent in the long than short CTO group, in-hospital complications were also similarly frequent between the 2groups. Furthermore, both groups had similar angiographic outcomes at 6 months and clinical outcomes at 2 years.

Cross-sectional data from a sample of 2,233 participants aged 18 or above was collected from the first wave of the “Trends and Implications of Poverty and Social Disadvantages in Hong Kong” survey. Socio-demographic factors, lifestyle factors, and physical and mental health conditions associated with people who were unable to seek medical services due to lack of financial means in the past year were examined using forward stepwise logistic regression analyses. Of the 2,233 participants surveyed, 8.4% did not seek medical care due to lack of financial means during the past year. They were more likely to be income-poor. With respect to physical and mental health, despite having less likelihood to have multimorbidity, they tended to have higher levels of both anxiety and stress, poorer physical and mental health-related quality of life, and suffer from more severe disability and pain symptoms affecting their daily activities, when compared to the rest of the Hong Kong population. People who were denied of medical care due to financial barriers are generally sicker than people in the general Hong Kong population, implying that those with greater healthcare needs may have financial difficulties in receiving timely and appropriate medical care. Our findings suggest that inequity in healthcare utilization remains a critical issue in Hong Kong."
https://openalex.org/W2901431118,"Background In patients with reperfused ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) both invasive and non-invasive assessments of microvascular dysfunction, the index of microcirculatory resistance (IMR), and microvascular obstruction (MVO) by cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR), independently predict poor long-term outcomes. Aims The aims of this study were to investigate whether an invasive parameter (IMR), assessed at the time of primary percutaneous intervention (PPCI), could predict the extent of MVO in proportion to infarct size (MVO index). Methods 50 patients presenting with STEMI and TIMI flow ≤ I in the infarct related artery were prospectively recruited to the study, before undergoing PPCI. All patients underwent invasive IMR assessment at maximal hyperaemia using adenosine, and following stent insertion. CMR was performed on day 2 following STEMI, MVO was assessed both on first-pass rest perfusion (early MVO) and in the late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) images (late MVO) along with infarct size. The MVO index was calculated as the ratio of late MVO/infarct size. Differences between IMR quartiles and the MVO index were investigated. Results The median IMR was 38.5 (range 9 to 202). The median size of late MVO was 1.9% LV (range 0 to 21.0% LV). IMR predicted late MVO (p<0.01) and as IMR increased, the MVO index increased (r = 0.70, [95% CI 0.53, 0.82], p<0.001). An IMR cut-off of 40 significantly predicted the presence of late MVO on CMR (p<0.001). Conclusion IMR measured at the time of PPCI in acutely reperfused STEMI is associated with the presence and severity of infarct damage as measured by the MVO index.

https://openalex.org/W2901207933,"South American coralsnakes are characterized by inconspicuous and poorly known species, which are potentially very sensitive to climate change. Here, we assess the impact of future climate change on the distributions of the Micrurus lemniscatus species complex after addressing the Wallacean shortfalls and refining the knowledge about their current geographic distributions. We also evaluate the efficiency of the current reserve network to protect the species in the present and future. We applied ecological niche model tools through a carefully examined set of occurrence records to generate potential present distributions and to project these distributions into future scenarios of climate change. Specific thresholds based on occurrence records along with expert opinions were used to delineate the geographic distribution of each species. A hierarchical ANOVA was applied to evaluate the uncertainties in species distributions across niche modeling methods and climate models and nested into the time factor (present and future). Multiple regression models were used to infer the relative importance of the climatic variables to determine the species’ suitability. A gap analysis was performed to address the representativeness of species distributions into protected areas. Predicted geographic distributions were compatible with the known distributions and the expert opinions, except for M. l. carvalhoi. New areas for field research were identified. Variation in precipitation was the most important factor defining the habitat suitability for all species, except for M. diutius. All taxa (except M. l. lemniscatus) will shrink their distributions in the future; less than 50% of the present suitable areas are protected in reserve networks, and less than 40% of these areas will be held in reserves in the future. We found strong evidence that coralsnakes may be highly sensitive to the ongoing changes and must be protected."
https://openalex.org/W2951170265,"Endometriosis is a disorder in which endometrial tissue is found outside the uterus causing pain, infertility and stress. Finding effective, non-hormonal and long-term treatments for endometriosis still remains one of the most significant challenges in the field. Corticotropin releasing hormone (CRH) is one of the main signaling peptides within the hypothalamic pituitary adrenal (HPA) axis released in response to stress. CRH can affect nervous and visceral tissues such as the uterus and gut via activation of two types of CRH receptors: CRHR1 and CRHR2. Our aim was to determine if blocking CRHR1 with antalarmin will reduce endometriosis progression. In experiment 1 we induced endometriosis in female rats by suturing uterine horn tissue next to the intestinal mesentery and allowed to progress for 7 days. We determined that after 7 days, there was a significant increase in CRHR1 within endometriotic vesicles as compared to normal uterus. In Experiment 2, we induced endometriosis and administered either antalarmin (20 mg/kg, i.p.) or vehicle during the first 7 days after surgery. A separate group of sham surgery rats served as non-endometriosis controls. Endometriosis was allowed to progress until 60 days after surgery, at which time rats were tested for anxiety behaviors. At the time of sacrifice, endometriotic vesicles, uterus and blood were collected. Treatment with antalarmin significantly reduced the size (67% decrease) and number (30% decrease) of endometriotic vesicles. Antalarmin also prevented the increase in CRH and CRHR1 mRNA within endometriotic vesicles but not of glucocorticoid receptor. Endometriosis did not change anxiety behaviors in the open field and zero-maze tests and prior antalarmin administration did not modify this. Our data provides the first in-vivo demonstration for use of CRHR1 antagonist for the treatment of endometriosis opening the possibility for further exploring CRH signaling as a treatment target for this debilitating disease."
https://openalex.org/W2953181977,"The crustacean Daphnia magna is an important model in multi-disciplinary scientific fields such as genetics, evolutionary developmental biology, toxicology, and ecology. Recently, the draft genome sequence and transcriptome data became publicly available for this species. Genetic transformation has also been achieved via the introduction of plasmid DNA into the genome. The identification of a screenable marker gene and generation of mutant strains are essential to further advance D. magna functional genomics. Because crustaceans are closely related to insects, we hypothesized that, similar to Drosophila genetic studies, eye color-related genes can function as marker genes in Daphnia. We searched orthologs of Drosophila eye pigment transporters White, Scarlet, and Brown in the genome of D. magna. Amino acid sequence alignment and phylogenetic analysis suggested that D. magna has six white and one scarlet orthologs, but lacks the brown ortholog. Due to the multiplicity of white orthologs, we analyzed the function of the scarlet ortholog, DapmaSt, using RNA interference. DapmaSt RNAi embryos showed disappearance of black pigments both in the compound eye and in the ocellus, suggesting that DapmaSt is necessary for black pigmentation in Daphnia eyes. To disrupt DapmaSt using the Crispr/Cas9 system, we co-injected DapmaSt-targeting gRNAs with Cas9 mRNAs into eggs and established white-eyed DapmaSt mutant lines that lack eye pigments throughout their lifespan. Our results suggest that DapmaSt can be used as a transformation marker in D. magna and the DapmaSt mutants would be an important resource for genetic transformation of this species in the future."
https://openalex.org/W2952896106,"Hygienic behaviour is a social immune response in honey bees shown to help provide resistance to honey bee pests and diseases. A survey of hygienic behaviour and brood diseases was conducted on 649 colonies in eastern Australia to initiate a selective breeding program targeting disease resistance and provide a level of resistance to Varroa (Varroa destructor Anderson and Trueman and V. jacobsoni Oudemans) mites should they become established in Australia. The test population showed a remarkably high baseline level of hygienic behaviour with 17% of colonies meeting or exceeding breeding selection thresholds. Colonies belonging to a breeding program were 5.8 times more likely to be highly hygienic and colonies headed by queens raised from hygienic queen mothers were 2.2 times more likely. Nectar availability (nectar yielding flowering plants within honey bee forage range) influenced hygienic behaviour expression but was not a significant predictor of level of hygienic behaviour. Surprisingly, hygienic behaviour was not a significant predictor of the presence of infection of the honey bee brood disease chalkbrood (Ascosphaera apis) and was not influential in predicting severity of chalkbrood infection in surveyed honey bee colonies. This study, along with reports from commercial beekeepers that chalkbrood infection is on the rise, warrants a deeper exploration of the host-pathogen relationship between Apis mellifera and Ascosphaera apis in Australia."
https://openalex.org/W2900817313,"Religious beliefs and spiritual connections to biodiversity have the potential to reduce animosity towards wildlife that might otherwise present a real or perceived threat to local people. Understanding this social dynamic can therefore be important for formulating locally-appropriate species-specific conservation strategies. Using semi-structured interviews which incorporated human-tiger conflict scenarios, we investigated how beliefs towards tigers varied between ethnic groups living around a large protected area that is home to the largest tiger population in Sumatra. We gathered this information to determine the degree to which cultural tolerance may contribute to the survival of the tiger in the Kerinci Seblat landscape, Indonesia. From 154 interviewees, 133 respondents came from three main ethnic groups, Minangkabau, Kerincinese and Melayu. The majority (73.5%) of Minangkabau interviewees cited that their ethnic group had customary laws regarding tigers, as did 52% of Melayu and 44% of Kerincinese. Irrespective of ethnicity, most participants did not perceive there to be a connection between Islam and tigers. All participants acknowledged the existence of zoological tigers and two groups (Minangkabau and Kerincinese) held a strong common belief that different types of spirit tigers also existed. From presenting different human-tiger conflict scenarios, with varying levels of severity towards livestock or human life, an unprovoked tiger attack in the village elicited the most calls for the tiger to be killed. Yet, if a village or family member was killed by a tiger whilst hunting in the forest then most respondents across all ethnic groups said to do nothing. The frequency of this response increased if a tiger killed someone in the village who had committed adultery, reflecting beliefs associated with the role of the tiger as an enforcer of moral rule. Our study highlights the importance of consulting with local communities who live in close proximity to large and potentially dangerous carnivores when developing conflict mitigation strategies, which hitherto has not been the case in Sumatra."
https://openalex.org/W2900654128,"It is known that crowded molecular environment affects the structure, thermodynamics, and dynamics of macromolecules. Most of the previous works on molecular crowding have majorly focused on the behavior of the macromolecule with less emphasis on the behavior of the crowder and water molecules. In the current study, we have precisely focused on the behavior of the crowder, (ethylene glycol (EG)), salt ions, and water in the presence of a DNA with the increase of the EG concentration. We have probed the behavior of water and crowder using molecular dynamics (MD) simulation and by calculating localized thermodynamic properties. Our results show an interesting competition between EG and water molecules to make hydrogen bonds (H-bond) with DNA. Although the total number of H-bonds involving DNA with both EG and water remains essentially same irrespective of the increase in EG concentration, there is a proportional change in the H-bonding pattern between water-water, EG-EG, and EG-water near DNA and in bulk. At low concentrations of EG, the displacement of water molecules near DNA is relatively easy. However, the displacement of water becomes more difficult as the concentration of EG increases. The density of Na+ (Cl-) near DNA increases (decreases) as the concentration of EG is increased. The density of Cl- near Na+ increases with the increase in EG concentration. It was also found that the average free energy per water in the first solvation shell increases with the increase in EG concentration. Putting all these together, a microscopic picture of EG, water, salt interaction in the presence of DNA, as a function of EG concentration, has emerged."
https://openalex.org/W2767205915,"Online communities, which have become an integral part of the day-to-day life of people and organizations, exhibit much diversity in both size and activity level; some communities grow to a massive scale and thrive, whereas others remain small, and even wither. In spite of the important role of these proliferating communities, there is limited empirical evidence that identifies the dominant factors underlying their dynamics. Using data collected from seven large online platforms, we observe a relationship between online community size and its activity which generally repeats itself across platforms: First, in most platforms, three distinct activity regimes exist—one of low-activity and two of high-activity. Further, we find a sharp activity phase transition at a critical community size that marks the shift between the first and the second regime in six out of the seven online platforms. Essentially, we argue that it is around this critical size that sustainable interactive communities emerge. The third activity regime occurs above a higher characteristic size in which community activity reaches and remains at a constant and higher level. We find that there is variance in the steepness of the slope of the second regime, that leads to the third regime of saturation, but that the third regime is exhibited in six of the seven online platforms. We propose that the sharp activity phase transition and the regime structure stem from the branching property of online interactions."

This study, performed in Portugal, aims to describe and compare early childhood educators and parents regarding their collaborative and interactive behavior when working with children. For that purpose, 55 educators (of both genders) with a child from their class and 45 parents (of both genders) with their children, participated in an everyday-like quasi-experimental situation for 20 minutes. The participants were invited to build an object of their choice, using a range of available materials and tools. The children included 47 boys and 48 girls, between 3 and 5 year-old. In comparison with the parents, the educators encouraged the children more to explore and find their own solutions. Conversely, the parents helped their children by offering demonstrations and directions. When the educators and the parents were grouped by gender (“men” versus “women”), different opportunities were offered to boys and girls by male and female adults. Our study suggests that educators and parents serve as diverse, but complementary educational role models and provide different learning opportunities."
https://openalex.org/W2901944030,"Stress is known to cause corpus luteum (CL) dysfunction, and stress hormones play a critical role in this process. However, the mechanism remains unclear. In this study, weaned sows were injected with synthetic adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) for 7 d; whole-genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS) and RNA sequencing was used respectively to investigate the systematic association between ACTH administration and DNA methylation in CL and its relationship to gene expression. Results showed that ACTH treatment significantly increased the concentrations of Cortisol (P < 0.05). The genome-wide DNA methylation maps of CL were provided, and the global analysis showed the difference between the 2 groups exists in the chromosomes and feature regions of the genome. A total of 88,559 DMRs were identified and the most DMR-related genes were gathered in terms of metabolic biologic processes, and some DMR-related genes were involved in cellular differentiation. Nine differentially expressed genes were screened out of coexpressed genes and 4 DMR-associated genes that were also differentially expressed (P < 0.05). In summary, our study firstly provides insight into the regulation of ACTH administration on genomic DNA methylation and gene expression in CL. We revealed a remarkable alteration of DNA methylation in CL caused by ACTH treatment, and identified 4 DMR-related genes that may be involved in the CL function under stress conditions.—Zhao, F., Wu, W., Wei, Q., Shen, M., Li, B., Jiang, Y., Liu, K., Liu, H.

https://openalex.org/W2900903306,"Background Despite many previous studies, the optimal oxygen fraction during general anesthesia remains controversial. This study aimed to evaluate the effects of lowering intraoperative fraction of inspired oxygen on postoperative gas exchange in patients undergoing microvascular decompression (MVD). Methods We conducted a pre-post study to compare postoperative gas exchange with different intraoperative oxygen fractions. From April 2010 to June 2017, 1456 consecutive patients who underwent MVD were enrolled. Starting in January 2014, routine oxygen fraction was lowered from 1.0 to 0.3 during anesthetic induction/awakening and from 0.5 to 0.3 during anesthetic maintenance. Postoperative gas exchange, presented as the minimum value of PaO2/FIO2 ratio within 48 hours, were compared along with adverse events. Results Among 1456 patients, 623 (42.8%) patients were stratified into group H (high FIO2) and 833 (57.2%) patients into group L (low FIO2). Intraoperative positive end-expiratory pressure was used in 126 (15.1%) patients in group H and 90 (14.4%) patients in group L (p = 0.77).The minimum value of PaO2/ FIO2 ratio within 48 hours after surgery was significantly greater in the group L (226.13 vs. 323.12; p < 0.001) without increasing any adverse events. Conclusion In patients undergoing MVD, lowering routine FIO2 and avoiding 100% O2 improved postoperative gas exchange."
https://openalex.org/W2901273401,"This study aimed to investigate the feasibility and clinical applicability of Diffusion Spectrum Imaging (DSI) for quantitative detection of white matter microstructural integrity. Twenty-seven patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM; aged 60.6±7.6 years) and 21 healthy controls (HC; aged 56.1±7.8 years) underwent high-resolution T1-weighted imaging and DSI scanning. Cognitive function scores were obtained using such instruments as the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA). The fasting blood glucose, glycated hemoglobin, and total cholesterol (CHO) of T2DM were measured. The bilateral uncinate fasciculus and superior cingulum bundle were reconstructed by DSI tractography. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS 21.0 software and P<0.05 was considered significant. Generalized fractional anisotropy (GFA) values were significantly decreased in the left uncinate fasciculus (t = −2.915, p = 0.005) and right superior cingulum bundle (t = −2.604, p = 0.012) in T2DM patients compared with the healthy controls (p<0.05). The MoCA (t = −3.339, p = 0.002) and CDT (t = −3.039, p = 0.004) scores of T2DM were significantly lower than those of healthy controls. Meanwhile, the GFA value of the right superior cingulum bundle was negatively associated with VFT score (r = −0.475, p = 0.012), and that of the right superior cingulum bundle was negatively associated with blood CHO level (r = −0.458, p = 0.016). DSI tractography is capable of evaluating the microstructural integrity of the white matter bundle in T2DM and is related to clinical cognitive scores and related biochemical indices; therefore, it can help to predict early white matter abnormalities in T2DM."
https://openalex.org/W2900881086,"Song complexity and singing frequency in male birds are shaped by female choice; they signal male quality because song is costly to develop and produce. The timing of song learning and the development of the brain structures involved occur during a period when chicks are exposed to a number of potential stressors. The quality and quantity of song produced by adults may therefore reflect the level of stress experienced during early life, a theory known as the 'developmental stress hypothesis'. We tested this hypothesis using song recordings and life-history data from an individually marked, long-term study population of wild dippers (Cinclus cinclus). The extent to which early life conditions predict adult song traits was investigated using natal brood size as a measure of sibling competition; the rate of provisioning by parents as a proxy for nutritional stress; and residuals of the linear regression between body mass and tarsus length as a measure of nestling condition. The syllable diversity in the songs of adult males was positively correlated with their body condition as nestlings, but there was no significant correlation with either provisioning rate or brood size. Provisioning rate did, however, predict song rate; males in relatively poor condition as nestlings or those raised in smaller broods which were fed more frequently by their parents sang at a higher rate in adulthood. These results support the developmental stress hypothesis and provide some of the first evidence from a wild bird of how the conditions experienced during early life impact adult song. Song traits may therefore provide females with information regarding both the current condition and developmental history of males."

This study aims to understand the potential factors related to HCV through the experiences of women who have undergone a pregnancy termination due to fetal anomaly. Methods Qualitative interview was used to collect data in this case study. Forty-one pregnant women who decided to terminate their pregnancy due to fetal anomaly were recruited from four Chinese hospital facilities, including three general hospitals and one specialty hospital in Changsha, Hunan, China. In-depth interviews were conducted from May to September 2017. Content analysis was used to analyze the data. Results Several potential factors related to violence in healthcare facilities were identified, including preventive factors, which possibly relieve healthcare violence; and negative experiences, which potentially related to healthcare violence. Preventive factors include healthcare providers gaining patient trust with detailed observation, expressing patient-centered care through discreet behavior, and showing patience and professionalism. Factors related to violence include busy work schedules, hurried visits, mechanized process, patients’ scant medical knowledge and mental distress. Conclusions This study highlights potential factors related to healthcare violence. The results will be submitted to the Chinese government’s policy making department in order to improve the healthcare system. We also suggest several important strategies to prevent HCV in a healthcare setting, both in China and globally."
https://openalex.org/W2900654270,"This paper studies whether intentionality is more prevalent than fairness in social preferences. We do this by introducing a new three-player game in which the choices of neutral third-party arbiters are isolated from any monetary or strategic concerns. This allows us to study the normative preferences of subjects, and to compare the relative weight they give to intentions and inequality. The results show that arbiters are mainly concerned with inequality, while other’s (selfish) intentions seem to play a minor role in their preferences. This result is robust to a series of experimental designs, suggesting that the role of intentions in social preferences might be smaller than implied by the previous literature."
https://openalex.org/W2900911002,"Patients with surgically treated osteoarthritis of the hip have an increased risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality many years after the operation compared with controls. Our hypothesis is that this increased risk after total hip arthroplasty (THA) is mediated by development of periprosthetic osteolysis leading to aseptic loosening of the implant.We conducted a nation-wide, nested, case-control study consisting of patients receiving a cemented THA due to osteoarthritis between the years 1992 and 2005. Our study population included a total of 14,430 subjects identified in the Swedish hip arthroplasty register and linked to the Swedish National Patient Register. The case group consisted of patients (n = 2,886) who underwent reoperation of the treated hip due to osteolysis or aseptic loosening at any time within five years after the index surgery. Each case was matched with four controls (n = 11,544) who had not undergone reoperation. The main outcomes were cardiovascular events i.e. myocardial infarction, heart failure and cerebral infarction according to ICD-codes and time to the first cardiovascular event during the exposure period. Outcomes were subgrouped into cardiac and cerebral events. We used regression models to calculate the incidence rates and adjusted our results for confounders.Overall, 5.1% of patients had cardiac events, with slightly more overall cardiovascular events occurring in the control group (8.1% vs. 6.7%, odds ratio 0.8, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.7 to 1.0). After adjusting for confounders, the case group had an increased relative risk of 1.3 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.1 to 1.3) for total number of cardiovascular events. Similar effect sizes were observed for time to first event.Patients with osteoarthritis who received THA and subsequently underwent a revision operation due to loosening had a higher relative risk of developing cardiovascular events than controls. Thus there is an association which could be explained by a common inflammatory disease pathway that requires further experimental research."
