https://openalex.org/W2031485535,"Selection by consequences is a causal mode found only in living things, or in machines made by living things. It was first recognized in natural selection, but it also accounts for the shaping and maintenance of the behavior of the individual and the evolution of cultures. In al three of these fields, it replaces explanations based on the causal modes of classical mechanics. The replacement is strongly resisted. Natural selection has now made its case, but similar delays in recognizing the role of selection in the other fields could deprive us of valuable help in solving the problems which confront us."

https://openalex.org/W1562907760,"The interactions between proteins and solvent components have been investigated for the sucrose/water system. Thermodynamic and kinetic measurements of the thermal unfolding of alpha-chymotrypsin, chymotrypsinogen, and ribonuclease were performed as a function of sucrose concentration. The alteration in protein-solvent interactions in the presence of sucrose was also studied by density measurements and analyzed by multicomponent thermodynamic theory. Sucrose does not induce a conformational change in three proteins studied, although it does induce a small change in the circular dichroism spectrum of ribonuclease. The enthalpy of thermal unfolding shows little dependence on the concentration of sucrose, while the apparent activation energy of the unfolding process is increased by the addition of sucrose. The results from the protein-solvent interaction study indicate that sucrose is preferentially excluded from the protein domain, increasing the free energy of the system. Thermodynamically this leads to protein stabilization since the unfolded state of the protein becomes thermodynamically even less favorable in the presence of sucrose. The exclusion of sucrose from the protein domain seems to be related to the higher cohesive force of the sucrose water solvent system since all the experimental observations can be correlated with the effect of sucrose on the surface tension of water."
https://openalex.org/W191339276,"Although phosphatidylserine is the sole phospholipid effective for the activation of Ca2+-activated, phospholipid-dependent protein kinase in the presence of a small amount of unsaturated diacylglycerol and micromolar concentrations of Ca2+ (Takai, Y., Kishimoto, A., Kikkawa, U., Mori, T., and Nishizuka, Y. (1979) Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 91, 1218-1224), other species of phospholipids modulate the activation of enzyme considerably. When phosphatidylserine is supplemented with phosphatidylethanolamine, further enhancement of the enzymatic activity is observed. Inversely, the addition of phosphatidylcholine or sphingomyelin markedly diminishes the enzyme activation by phosphatidylserine. Phosphatidylinositol, which serves as the source of unsaturated diacylglycerol, and phosphatidic acid do not show significant effects. Kinetic analysis has indicated that phosphatidylethanolamine enhances the enzyme activation by marked increase in the affinity of enzyme for Ca2+ and also by slight increase in the affinity for phosphatidylserine as well as for unsaturated diacylglycerol without affecting the maximum reaction velocity. Phosphatidylcholine and sphingomyelin diminish the enzyme activation in an uncompetitive manner with respect to Ca2+ and in a competitive manner with respect to both phosphatidylserine and unsaturated diacylglycerol. These results suggest that each species of the various membrane phospholipids plays a specific role with positive or negative cooperativity in the activation of this unique protein kinase."
https://openalex.org/W1600324333,"The thermally induced in vitro self-assembly of collagen molecules to form active fibrils illustrates that collagen molecules themselves contain all of the structural information necessary for assembly. The molecule contains three structural domains, the NH2 and carboxyl-terminal extra helical regions (the telopeptides) and the major triple helical rod-like domain. Proteolytic removal of the short telopeptide domains drastically alters the in vitro self-assembly process. We have examined the specific contributions of each telopeptide to the initiation (nucleation) and growth stages of self-assembly in collagens modified by selective proteinase treatment and by isolating a peptide containing the amino telopeptide and adding this to both normal and proteinase-modified collagen self-assembly systems. Pronase-modified collagen, devoid of both telopeptides, initiated self-assembly very poorly. Addition of small amounts of intact collagen accelerated the rate of nucleation of pronase-modified collagen. Addition of carboxypeptidase-modified collagen also accelerated the nucleation of pronase-modified collagen, suggesting that the remaining amino telopeptide was involved in nucleation. This was confirmed by isolating the cyanogen bromide fragment of the alpha 1(I) subunit containing the amino telopeptide and finding that it specifically accelerated the nucleation of intact pepsin- and pronase-modified to collagens. The amino telopeptide appears to bind to a specific region within the collagen triple helical domain. The isolated peptide requires thermal pretreatment to be active; hence, this interaction must involve a unique telopeptide conformation. This behavior is compatible with the recent model (Helseth, D. L., Jr., Lechner, J. H., and Veis, A. (1979) Biopolymers 18, 3005-3014) proposed for the conformation of the amino telopeptide and its interaction with a helical receptor site as a step in nucleation. Comparison of the behavior of leucine aminopeptidase- and carboxypeptidase-modified collagens suggests that the carboxyl telopeptide has its major role in the growth stages of self-assembly."

An impaired humoral-mediated immune response (decreased numbers of antibody-producing cells) is observed in mice with severe as well as marginal copper deficiency. The magnitude of this impairment is highly correlated with the degree of functional copper deficiency (hypoceruloplasminemia)."

From the molecular dimensions of the largest permeants and smallest impermeants the permeation-limiting channel diameter was obtained: 16 to 20 angstroms for the mammalian cells and 20 to 30 angstroms for the insect cells."
https://openalex.org/W1996270249,"Female rats are masculinized in utero by male littermates sharing the same uterine horn. Increased anogenital distances in neonatal females and mounting behavior in adult females are related to the presence of males on the caudal side of the females in the uterine horn. Contrary to current beliefs, interamniotic diffusion may not be responsible for the exchange of masculinizing agents among fetuses. Since uterine blood flow in the rat is from the direction of the cervix toward the ovary, masculinizing hormones secreted by fetal males may be carried via the uterine vasculature to female littermates located further downstream."
https://openalex.org/W1516552294,Cultured macrophages were shown to synthesize and constitutively secrete a triglyceride lipase identified as lipoprotein lipase on the basis of the following criteria: 1) it required apolipoprotein C-II for optimal activity; 2) it exhibited maximal activity at pH 8.2; 3) it was inhibited by 1 M NaCl; 4) it bound tightly to a heparin-Sepharose affinity gel and was eluted with buffer containing 1.5 M NaCl; and 5) the quantity of enzyme released from macrophages was enhanced by heparin. Cycloheximide treatment of macrophage cultures blocked the spontaneous secretion of lipoprotein lipase. Macrophage secretion of lipoprotein lipase may be relevant to the role of this cell in atherogenesis.

https://openalex.org/W2037227901,"Hamsters deprived from birth of the neocortex developed normally and displayed the usual hamster-typical behavioral patterns. With the additional concurrent destruction of midline limbic convolutions (cingulate and underlying dorsal hippocampal), there were deficits in maternal behavior and a lack of development of play behavior. These findings demonstrate in a rodent (i) that the striatal complex and limbic system, along with the remaining neuraxis, are sufficient for giving expression to a wide range of unlearned forms of species-typical behavior and (ii) that midline limbic structures are required for the expression of play behavior and the integrated performance of maternal behavior."
https://openalex.org/W1480070904,"The phosphorylation state of myosin in intact platelets has been investigated with alkaline urea-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. In gels of control cells, a band was found that co-migrated with the dephosphorylated form of isolated platelet myosin 20,000-dalton light chain. Stimulation of the cells by thrombin produced a dose-dependent shift of this band to the same position as that of the phosphorylated light chain. Conversion to the phosphorylated position was both complete and saturable with respect to thrombin concentration. Two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was used to confirm the identity of this band as the 20,000-dalton myosin light chain. When (32P)PO4-labeled platelets were used, a direct correlation was found between the position of the light chain on the alkaline urea gel and the radioactivity. Our results demonstrate that in resting platelets myosin exists mainly in the dephosphorylated state and that stimulation by thrombin can produce a shift to the totally phosphorylated state."

https://openalex.org/W1569246539,"Alkaline phosphatase has been purified from microsomes of chicken epiphyseal cartilage by first selectively extracting certain adventitious proteins with 0.25 M trichloroacetate. The membrane-bound enzyme was then solubilized by 1% cholate in buffered 33% saturated ammonium sulfate and purified by column chromatography on Bio-Gel A-5m, extraction with 1-butanol, and ion exchange chromatography on DEAE-Bio-Gel A. The purified alkaline phosphatase from the cartilage membrane had a subunit molecular weight of 53,000 and a holoenzyme weight of 207,000-220,000, indicating a tetramer. The pH optima for p-nitrophenylphosphate, ATP, and pyrophosphate hydrolysis were 10.3, 9.0, and 8.5, respectively. Values of Vmax (in micromoles/min/mg) were 220, 3.1, and 0.8, respectively. Substrate inhibition was pronounced at values of pH below 8.5. Inhibition of p-nitrophenylphosphate hydrolysis at pH 10.3 showed that phosphate and arsenate were competitive inhibitors (KI = 1.88 and 0.15 mM, respectively) and levamisole was an uncompetitive inhibitor (KI = 0.32 mM), while L-phenylalanine and ZnCl2 were mixed inhibitors (KI = 15.8 and 0.02 mM, respectively). Inhibition by preincubation in 1 mM EDTA was reversible by readdition of 0.25 mM MgCl2 nd 20 microM ZnCl2. The data indicate that this membrane-bound alkaline phosphatase from chicken epiphyseal cartilage is a Zn2+ and possibly Mg2+-containing enzyme. While the subunit molecular weight and kinetic properties of the enzyme are quite typical of vertebrate alkaline phosphatases, the tightness of binding to the membrane lipids, the extreme sensitivity to substrate inhibition, and the tetrameric conformation of the holoenzyme are unusual."
https://openalex.org/W1502038587,"A cyclic-nucleotide independent heparin-sensitive nuclear protein kinase (NII) from the Morris hepatoma 3924A has been purified by a combination of ion exchange and affinity chromatographic procedures and velocity gradient centrifugation. The purified kinase had a molecular weight of 140,000 as determined by gel filtration. Two polypeptides (Mr = 42,000 and 25,600) were present in the purified preparation in approximately equimolar concentrations. The protein kinase employed Mg2+ and Co2+ as divalent ion and preferred the nonhistone proteins, casein or phosvitin, as protein acceptors. In the presence of Mg2+, it utilized both ATP and GTP as substrates and transferred the terminal nucleotide phosphate to serine and threonine residues of the protein acceptor. Phosphorylation of casein was stimulated by polyamines, particularly spermine. This polyamine preferentially enhanced phosphate transfer to threonine. The enzyme was inhibited by several compounds including heparin, the o-n-octyloxime of rifamycin (AF/013), 3'-dATP, o-phenanthroline, polynucleotides, and ADP. Of these inhibitors, heparin was the most potent and completely abolished kinase activity at a concentration of 0.1 micrograms/ml. The kinase could be autophosphorylated by incubation with Mg2+ and [gamma-32P]ATP; under these conditions phosphorylation was confined to the polypeptide of Mr = 24,600 and was completely inhibited by heparin. Based on the unique properties of NII protein kinase (ability to use GTP, stimulation by spermine, sensitivity to heparin), a selective assay was developed which could measure NII activity in the presence of other nuclear kinases. Under the optimal assay conditions, the nuclear extract of hepatoma 3924A was found to contain at least five times more NII kinase activity than that of normal adult liver. Analysis of extensively purified preparations from the two sources confirmed these results. After purification 11 times more NII protein kinase activity was obtained from hepatoma 3924A than from liver. Although hepatoma and liver protein kinases exhibited many common properties, they displayed distinct nucleotide saturation kinetics. The apparent Km for ATP was 10 microM for hepatoma protein kinase and 24 microM for the liver enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W2095353123,"Rats were trained to walk on a treadmill to avoid foot shock. The animals developed tolerance for ethanol if given subsequent practice while ethanol intoxicated. Rats given equivalent doses of ethanol after practice did not develop tolerance, nor did saline-treated controls. These results challenge the hypothesis that mere repeated doses of ethanol are sufficient to induce tolerance. It seems that tolerance does not develop unless the response used to measure tolerance is performed while the subject is intoxicated."

These three factors were not affected by adjustment for the potential confounding variables examined in this study."
https://openalex.org/W2168859550,"Long-term recording from single lumbar motoneurons of intact cats revealed activation patterns fundamentally different from those seen in decerebrate preparations. In intact cats, motoneuron bursts showed marked rate modulation without initial doublets. Each unit's frequencygram generally resembled the envelope of the gross electromyogram simultaneously recorded from the corresponding muscle. Average and peak discharge rates increased for faster gaits. These findings suggest that, in cat locomotion, rate modulation is a more important contributor to force regulation than was previously thought."
https://openalex.org/W2047882958,"Tumorous tobacco shoots have been derived from callus tissues produced by Agrobacterium tumefaciens-induced transformation of tobacco protoplasts and by fusion of normal protoplasts with those from crown gall tumors. The continued presence of T-DNA sequences in shoots is directly demonstrated by Southern blotting and is also revealed by the presence of the tumor markers octopine and nopaline. When grafted onto normal tobacco plants, both octopine- and nopaline-type shoots (including those from somatic hybrids) produced flowers and set seed. Germination of these seeds gave F1 progeny that showed retention of morphological markers of their parental shoots, and one seedling retained the ability to synthesize nopaline. The data demonstrate that T-DNA markers can be retained during meiosis and are expressed in F1 plants."
https://openalex.org/W2085631897,Infestations by the nematode Heligmosomoides polygyrus can prevent adult male mice from becoming behaviorally dominant. The effect is dose-dependent and is more likely to influence the development of dominance than to disrupt existing dominance relationships. Doses capable of exerting this effect are not lethal and do not affect weight.
https://openalex.org/W1597887900,"A hydrodynamic model of the high molecular weight platelet glycoprotein thrombospondin is formulated from physical solution measurements of molecular weight, partial specific volume, sedimentation coefficient, and intrinsic viscosity. Simultaneous sedimentation equilibrium analysis of thrombospondin in buffered saline prepared in H2O and D2O yielded values of 420,000 and 0.714 ml/g for the molecular weight and partial specific volume, respectively. A sedimentation coefficient of 8.6 S was found to be independent of the protein concentration over the range 0-6 mg/ml. The intrinsic viscosity was determined to be 40 ml/g at 20 degrees C for native thrombospondin and 52 ml/g for thrombospondin in the presence of 6 M guanidine-HCl. Based on these values thrombospondin is best described as a prolate ellipsoid with an axial ratio of 9.3. This model agrees well with the electron microscopic image of thrombospondin as a nodular rod (7 X 65 nm)-shaped molecule with an axial ratio of 10. Sedimentation equilibrium analysis and sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis indicated that thrombospondin is comprised of three 140,000-dalton polypeptide chains. The percentage of residues in alpha-helix was calculated to be only 3% from the circular dichroism spectrum."
https://openalex.org/W2020740498,"M-MuLV-specific DNA probes were used to establish the state of integration and amplification of recombinant proviral sequences in Moloney virus-induced tumors of Balb/Mo, Balb/c and 129 mice. The somatically acquired viral sequences contain both authentic M-MuLV genomes and recombinants of M-MuLV with endogenous viral sequences. All reintegrated genomes carry long terminal repeat (LTR) sequences at both termini of their genome. In the preleukemic stage a large population of cells exhibiting a random distribution of reintegrated M-MuLV genomes are seen, but during outgrowth of the tumor, selection of cells occurs leaving one or a few clonal descendants in the outgrown tumor. In this latter stage recombinant genomes can be detected. Although these recombinants constitute a heterogeneous group of proviruses, characteristic molecular markers are conserved among many individual proviral recombinants, lending credence to the notion that a certain recombinant structure is a prerequisite for the onset of neoplasia. The structure of these recombinants shows close structural similarities to the previously described mink cell focus-inducing (MCF)-type viruses."
https://openalex.org/W1986074632,"Incubation at 37 degrees C of excised rat prostate tissue results in massive proliferative assembly of new tight junction strands along the entire lengths of the lateral plasma membranes of the columnar epithelial cells. The new tight junction elements are assembled within 5 minutes and have an average length six times that of those present in the apical tight junction band. Massive assembly occurs in the presence of protein synthesis inhibitors (cycloheximide) or of metabolic uncouplers (dinitrophenol). Thus, proliferative assembly of tight junction strands involves molecular reorganization from a pool of preexisting, probably membrane-associated, components. The fascia occludens and some examples of experimentally induced tight junction proliferation may reflect the massive emergence of tight junction strands when tissue is subjected to diverse stressful conditions."

If one eye is lost at birth, this cell death is reduced in the remaining eye. This may account for the increased ipsilateral projection from this eye to the thalamus and midbrain observed in these animals."
https://openalex.org/W2093793653,"The proteins associated with poly(A) and other regions of mRNA and hnRNA molecules in mouse L cells were investigated with the aid of ultraviolet light-induced crosslinking of proteins to RNA. The poly(A)s of polyribosomal and free cytoplasmic mRNAs are associated with a protein, p78A. In contrast, the poly(A) of hnRNA is associated with a smaller protein, p60A, that differs from p78A in its partial peptide map. p78A occurs free in the cytoplasm, but p60A does not. There is a second 78 kd protein, p78X, associated with mRNA sequences other than poly(A). p78X differs from p78A in its partial peptide map. The total proteins crosslinked to polyribosomal and free cytoplasmic mRNAs are similar. However, the total proteins crosslinked to hnRNA are quite different from those crosslinked to mRNA. We suggest that newly synthesized mRNA molecules emerging from the nucleus into the cytoplasm shed the proteins with which they were associated in the nucleus and become associated with a new set of proteins derived from the cytosol. Furthermore, the cytoplasmic mRNA-associated proteins continue to exchange with free proteins."
https://openalex.org/W2079024990,"We have isolated the chicken beta-type globin genes from a library of chicken DNA--lambda Charon 4A recombinant bacteriophage. There are four beta-type genes within this segment of the genome; we believe this represents all of the beta-type genes of the chicken. The recombinant lambda C beta G1 contains the embryonic epsilon- and adult beta-globin genes. The hatching beta H- and embryonic rho-globin genes are found in the recombinant lambda C beta G2. Although lambda C beta G1 and lambda C beta G2 do not physically overlap, we present evidence that all four genes are closely linked and transcribed from the same DNA strand. These experiments demonstrate that the chromosomal regions represented by lambda C beta G1 and lambda C beta G2 lie approximately 1.6 kb apart in the chicken genome. A third recombinant lambda C beta G3 extends the genomic locus studied in the vicinity of the beta-type globin genes to approximately 39 kb. The physical order of the chicken beta-type globin genes within this segment of the chromosome is 5' ... rho--beta H--beta--epsilon ... 3'. This arrangement is unique among the vertebrate beta-type globin gene clusters thus far examined, in that embryonic genes are located at the 5' and 3' ends of the cluster while the hatching and adult genes occupy central positions."

Genes for the five proteins are clustered on a 9.0 kb segment of cloned DNA which is part of a homogeneous family of sequences containing 600–800 members per haploid genome. The 9.0 kb histone gene clusters are not adjacent in the genome, but are separated from neighboring clusters by up to 50 kb or more of cluster spacer sequences; some or all of these spacer sequences are members of a predominantly centromeric satellite DNA with a 225 bp repeating unit."
https://openalex.org/W1864176760,"Replenishment of uterine estrogen receptor was examined in immature rats following injection of 16 alpha-estradiol. 16 alpha-Estradiol is a short-acting estrogen that, after a single injection, stimulates early estrogenic responses (water imbibition, induced protein synthesis, etc.), but not long term responses (DNA synthesis). Replenishment after 16 alpha-estradiol injection was complete within 4 h. Furthermore, disappearance of receptor from the nucleus closely corresponded to a reappearance of receptor in the cytoplasm. In contrast to this, receptor replenishment following injection of 1 microgram of either diethylstilbesterol or 17 beta-estradiol was very slow and lagged behind the disappearance of nuclear receptor, leading to an apparent decrease in total receptor content. Half-lives for the clearance of nuclear estrogen-receptor complexes were estimated to be 30 min for 16 alpha-estradiol and 2 h for 17 beta-estradiol, respectively. Inhibition of protein synthesis by cycloheximide did not inhibit replenishment after 16 alpha-estradiol injection. Studies on replenishment after 17 beta-estradiol injection in the presence of cycloheximide could not be interpreted due to a decrease in total receptor content caused by long term cycloheximide treatment. Multiple injections of 17 alpha-estradiol did not lead to a lag in replenishment time or a decrease in total receptor content. This represents a case in which estrogen receptor replenishment appears to be due entirely to receptor recycling."
https://openalex.org/W2418440534,"These studies were done to characterize the rate of uptake of high (HDL) and low (LDL) density lipoprotein cholesterol by the adrenal gland of the rat under in vivo conditions. Animals were pretreated for 4 days with 4-aminopyrazolo[3,4-d]pyrimidine to essentially eliminate endogenous plasma lipoproteins and with aminoglutethimide for 1 h to block conversion of cholesterol to adrenal hormones. Such animals were then infused with varying amounts of HDL and LDL from both human and rat plasma, and this led to rapid accumulation of cholesterol, both free and esterified, in the adrenal glands over the subsequent 4-h period of observation. This uptake process was linear with respect to time and manifested saturation kinetics with respect to the steady state level of plasma lipoprotein cholesterol. When human lipoproteins were infused, the maximal rate of cholesterol uptake was approximately 0.45 mg/pair of adrenal glands/h for both HDL and LDL; however, the half-maximal rate of uptake (Km) was achieved at a plasma HDL cholesterol concentration of only 12 mg/dl while a concentration of 61 mg/dl was required to achieve the same velocity with LDL. When similar experiments were carried out with rat HDL, the Km equaled 7.2 mg/dl and a maximal rate of uptake of 0.32 mg/pair of adrenal glands/h was achieved. It was not possible to obtain complete kinetic curves using rat LDL, but at physiological plasma concentrations, there was no difference in the rate of cholesterol uptake from LDL of rat or human origin. When large amounts of both HDL (5.8 times Km) and LDL (3.1 times Km) were infused into the same animals, the rate of cholesterol uptake essentially equaled the sum of the maximal transport rates for the two lipoproteins. These data provide additional support for the concept that the adrenal gland (and ovary) of the rat can take up HDL and LDL cholesterol by separate mechanisms. However, from the quantitative data on the kinetics of these uptake processes, it is apparent that in this species HDL cholesterol must be the major substrate for the synthesis of adrenal hormones."
https://openalex.org/W2001400457,"The effects of amitriptyline, lithium, and electroconvulsive shock on cerebral permeability and blood flow were tested. These three treatments share in common (i) the ability to influence the functional activity of central adrenergic neurons by way of effects on the release, reuptake, or metabolism of norepinephrine and (ii) therapeutic efficacy in mood disturbances. Under control conditions, cerebral permeability increases linealy with increasing arterial partial pressure of carbon dioxide and hence cerebral blood flow. All three treatments altered this relationship in a manner consistent with their adrenergic effects. Amitriptyline potentiated this increase in cerebral permeability whereas lithium and electroconvulsive shock blunted this phenomenon. These results support the hypothesis that one function of central adrenergic neurons is regulation of the blood-brain barrier and raise the possibility that a related effect may underlie the clinical usefulness of such treatment."
https://openalex.org/W1540680204,"Troponin T kinase was purified from dog heart extracts to apparent homogeneity (specific activity, 0.8-1.1 mumol of P incorporated/mg of protein/min at 30 degrees C). Analysis of the purified enzyme by means of polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate showed two major protein bands corresponding to Mr = 37,000 and 28,000. The Mr = 28,000 band was found to be phosphorylated after incubation of the enzyme with [32P]ATP.Mg. The molecular weight of the enzyme was calculated to be approximately 125,000 from the results of gel filtration on Sephacryl S-300. It would appear that cardiac troponin T kinase is composed of two 37,000- and two 28,000-dalton subunits. The purified kinase was found to phosphorylate troponin T from cardiac or skeletal muscle even in the presence of other components of the troponin system. Phosvitin and casein were also phosphorylated by the enzyme. The Km for ATP was determined to be 7 microM; free Mg2+ was required for maximal activity. Calcium ions, either in the presence of absence of calmodulin, had only a slight inhibitory effect. Addition of fluoride ions (50 mM) and arginine-rich histone (1 mg/ml) to the reaction mixture resulted in a strong inhibition of the activity. Cyclic nucleotides did not affect the kinase activity."
https://openalex.org/W2001107208,Perinatal morbidity and mortality are associated with colonization of the chorionic surface of the placenta by Ureaplasma urealyticum or Mycoplasma hominis or both. These organisms are more strongly associated with unfavourable gestational outcome than group B streptococci. Chlamydia trachomatis does not appear to be important in the etiology of reproductive casualties. The mechanisms linking the mycoplasmas to perinatal disorders and death are not clear but merit investigation.
https://openalex.org/W1571128250,"Results are presented here which demonstrate that the rates of [14C]acetate incorporation into cholesterol and dolichol increased 4- to 5-fold as mouse spermatocytes matured from the preleptotene to prepuberal pachytene stages. The rate of acetate incorporation into cholesterol then decreased in late pachynema, remained low at all subsequent stages of meiosis, and was very low in mature sperm. In contrast, the rate of acetate incorporation into dolichol remained elevated in late pachytene spermatocytes and round spermatids, then decreased and remained low in mature sperm. The ratio of the rate of [14C]acetate incorporation into dolichol to the rate of incorporation into cholesterol increased during late meiotic prophase and remained high in round spermatids; this altered ratio is further evidence of independent regulation of dolichol and cholesterol synthesis in testes. It was shown previously that normal adult mouse testes incorporated acetate into dolichol at a much higher rate (1.8 to 2.4% of the rate of incorporation into cholesterol) than did testes from sterile W/Wv mice (0.02%) or X-irradiated mice (0.24%). This high rate of acetate incorporation into dolichol in adult testes is now attributed to differentiating spermatocytes, with particularly high rates being observed during pachynema."

https://openalex.org/W1540793347,"The energetics of flux through carbamyl phosphate synthetase and of citrulline formation from added ammonia, bicarbonate, and ornithine have been investigated in liver mitochondria from rats fed a high protein diet. In the presence of an oxidizable substrate, but in the absence of ornithine, carbamyl phosphate accumulated as a function of the medium phosphate concentration (K'm approximately 1.5 mM) up to values of 30 nmol/mg of protein. Upon addition of ornithine, citrulline was produced at the rate of 70 nmol/mg/min, and the carbamyl phosphate content fell to below 1 nmol/mg. The intramitochondrial ATP/ADP ratio decreased after ornithine addition, indicating that release of inhibition of carbamyl phosphate synthetase by carbamyl phosphate predominated over the expected inhibition due to the fall of the ATP/ADP ratio. Under partially uncoupled conditions in the presence of ornithine, citrulline formation decreased linearly with a fall of the calculated intramitochondrial MgATP/MgADP ratio. Changes of the thermodynamic parameters of mitochondrial phosphorylation potential, delta Gp(m), proton electrochemical gradient, delta mu H+, and oxidation-reduction potential difference between NAD+ and cytochrome c, delta Eh, were measured under conditions of enhanced respiration induced by citrulline synthesis and compared with ADP-stimulated respiration. Under both conditions, delta Gp(m) decreased and delta Eh also decreased due to a net oxidation of NADH and reduction of cytochrome c. However, delta mu H+ showed no change after citrulline addition although it decreased during ADP-stimulated respiration. The average H+/2e stoichiometry over the first two phosphorylation sites calculated from the delta Eh/delta mu H+ ratio ranged from 3.0 to 3.5, while the H+/ATP stoichiometry calculated from the delta Gp(m)/delta mu H+ ratio ranged from 2.0 to 2.5. The calculated ratios of H+/2e and H+/ATP both increased as delta mu H+ was lowered by addition of an uncoupling agent. The overall data are apparently not in accordance with the commonly held view that delta mu H+ is an obligatory intermediate between the oxidation-reduction pumps of the respiratory chain and ATP synthase."
https://openalex.org/W1544086962,"Abstract Fluorescence polarization of cis- and trans-parinaric acid and high angle x-ray diffraction are used to examine the physical effects of in vitro sterol depletion of LM cell plasma membranes. Measurements on lipids isolated from the normal plasma membrane show that most of the lipid is fluid between 5 and 45 degrees C. When no sterol is present, approximately 15% of the phospholipids undergo gel phase formation, detectable by x-ray measurements, in this temperature range. Partial sterol repletion of the isolated phospholipids serves to lower the onset temperature of the phase transition, as well as to decrease the fraction of lipid undergoing a transition. Intact plasma membranes are sterol depleted by in vitro incubation with egg phosphatidylcholine liposomes. This induces a phase transition with an onset temperature increasingly above the physiological temperature as more sterol is removed from the membranes. The transition can be suppressed by returning sterol to the membranes. These experiments extend earlier work (Rintoul, D. A., Chou, S.-M., and Silbert, D. F. (1979) J. Biol. Chem. 254, 10070-10077) on isolated plasma membrane lipids by showing that sterol suppresses a phase transition in intact membranes as well as in isolated lipids. The correlation between gel phase formation upon sterol loss at the physiological temperature and loss of membrane glucose transport function is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1568313811,"Fluorescent conjugates of beta A subunits and their respective heme-free derivatives have been prepared in which a 1,5-N-iodoacetylaminoethyl-5-naphthylamine-1-sulfonate probe has been specifically placed at the beta-93 or beta-112 cysteine. The fluorescence anisotropy decay and static fluorescence polarization of these conjugates have been examined. Fluorescence measurements have also been made using 1-anilino-8-naphthalenesulfonate complexes, as well as the intrinsic fluorescence of the tryptophan groups. For the cases of the beta-93 and beta-112 conjugates there is substantial evidence for internal rotational freedom of the subunits. The internal mobility of the polypeptide is especially pronounced for the beta-112 conjugate. In contrast, the 1-anilino-8-naphthalenesulfonate probe placed within the heme pocket shows no indication of any rotation, other than that associated with the entire beta-subunit. Tryptophan fluorescence has been measured for the apo-beta subunits and for the peptides beta (1-55) from hemoglobins A and S. Perrin-Weber plots show the presence of multiple rotational modes suggesting mobility of the tryptophan groups."
https://openalex.org/W1501138563,"Reconstitution of homogeneous bovine heart mitochondrial transhydrogenase into phosphatidylcholine liposomes results in a greater than 80% inhibition of NADPH leads to 3-acetylpyridine adenine dinucleotide (AcPyAD+) transhydrogenation. This coupled rate is stimulated 5-fold by addition of protonophore to the rate observed with unreconstituted enzyme. In the absence of uncoupler, addition of low concentrations (10 microM) of NADH promotes by about 3-fold the rate of reduction of AcPyAD+ in the presence of NADPH. In the absence of NADPH, no reduction of AcPyAD+ by NADH occurs. Addition of valinomycin to K+-loaded proteoliposomes stimulated NADPH leads to AcPyAD+ transhydrogenation to the uncoupled rate and allowed the uptake of protons from the medium. In the absence of valinomycin, the rapid reduction of AcPyAD+ seen on addition of NADH was not coupled to proton translocation. In the presence of valinomycin, NADH addition neither equilibrated protons across the liposomal membrane nor affected the stoichiometry of proton uptake to hydride ion transfer (H+:H- ratio). Addition of NADH to proteoliposomes in the presence of AcPyAD+ and NADPH resulted in an initial rapid formation of reduced 3-acetylpyridine adenine dinucleotide comparable to the amount of NADH added. Thereafter, the rate of AcPyAD+ reduction returned to that seen in the absence of NADH. These results suggest that the NADH requirement for AcPyAD+ reduction is stoichiometric rather than catalytic. Stereospecificity studies demonstrate that reconstituted transhydrogenase catalyzes a direct transfer of a hydride ion equivalent from the 4A locus of NADH to the 4A locus of the NADH product in the presence, but not in the absence, of NADPH. It is proposed that NADH leads to NAD+ transhydrogenation represents a partial reaction of NADPH leads to NAD+ transhydrogenation which involves the participation of a reduced-enzyme intermediate."
https://openalex.org/W1501981098,"The studies described herein entail the isolation and characterization of native mucin isolated in the absence of disulfide reducing agents. The rheological characteristics of mucin closely resemble those of whole sputum. The aggregation of mucin molecules is responsible for the high viscosity of concentrated mucin solutions such as sputum. Disulfide reducing agents reduce the viscosity of concentrated mucin solutions by dissociation of soluble mucin aggregates without affecting the insoluble aggregates. Detailed chemical analyses of the mucins have been carried out and indicate that the reduction of interchain disulfides is accompanied, not only by a reduction in mucin viscosity, but by the liberation of two small proteins from the large mucin molecule. Detailed analyses of the cysteine plus cystine content of native mucin indicate that none of the free cysteines are accessible to alkylation in the absence of denaturants. Approximately 80% of the cystine content of the molecule is accessible to disulfide reduction in the absence of denaturants. This finding accounts for the ability of disulfide reducing agents to reduce sputum viscosity under nondenaturing conditions."
https://openalex.org/W2047723691,"The nitrate balance of germfree and conventional rats was assessed to determine whether the intestinal flora produces nitrate in vivo. The results indicate that there can be excess nitrate in the urine of germfree as well as conventional rats. This nitrate is apparently of host origin, and the presence of intestinal flora decreases the output of nitrate in urine."
https://openalex.org/W2017195244,"Wild-type normal rat kidney fibroblasts infected with the Friend strain of murine leukemia virus (MuLV) contain two virus-encoded glycoproteins on the outer surfaces of their plasma membranes: an envelope glycoprotein with an apparent molecular weight of 70,000 (gp70), and a glycoprotein that reacts with antisera to the major virion internal core proteins p30, p15, p12 and p10 and has an apparent molecular weight of 93,000 (gp93gag). To analyze the functions of these glycoproteins and to develop a model system for studying genetics of membrane synthesis, we used an immunoselection method to isolate variant cell clones defective in processing these glycoproteins into their plasma membranes. Several lines of evidence, including complementation of glycoprotein processing defects by fusion with uninfected wild-type cells, indicate that the immunoselected variants have stably inherited membrane synthesis abnormalities that are encoded by cellular rather than by viral genes. The H-4 cell line, which was selected by use of antiserum to gp70, has metabolic defects that interfere with processing of both gp70 and gp93gag into its plasma membranes. Nevertheless, this cell line releases noninfectious MuLV. Furthermore, two cell lines (2 and 5), which were selected by use of antiserum to the virion core protein p30, specifically lack detectable cell surface or intracellular gp93gag but contain cell surface gp70 and release infectious MuLV. These results suggest that MuLV particles can bud efficiently from cells that lack known virus-encoded plasma membrane constituents."
https://openalex.org/W1491044277,"Squalene-enriched, trypsinized microsomes display no squalene epoxidase activity either as such or when combined with normal microsomes. On addition of microgram quantities of supernatant protein factor to the combined system, squalene epoxidation commences at once and continues at a rapid rate (Friedlander, E. J., Caras, I. W., Lin, L. F., and Bloch, K. (1980) J. Biol. Chem. 255, 8042-8045). When mixtures of trypsin-treated, [3H]squalene-containing microsomes and normal microsomes are subjected to isopycnic density gradient centrifugation, the two microsomal populations separate readily. Essentially all of the radioactive squalene remains associated with the lighter (trypsinized) fraction of microsomes. However, if the mixture of microsomes is initially incubated with supernatant protein factor and then centrifuged, a large fraction of labeled squalene sediments with the denser, normal microsomes. Thus, supernatant protein factor mediates the transfer of squalene from one microsome population to another. This conclusion had previously been reached on the basis of less direct experiments (Friedlander, E. J., Caras, I. W., Lin, L. F., and Bloch, K. (1980) J. Biol. Chem. 255, 8042-8045). Evidence is presented that the process of supernatant protein factor-mediated squalene transfer does not involve membrane fusion and proceeds also in the reverse direction."

https://openalex.org/W1583426391,"Studies have been undertaken to explain the observed variation of the apparent association constant for water-insoluble substrates, which were diluted in common organic solvents, as a direct function of the solvent/solute ratio. By the use of suitable equations, the solvents methanol, ethanol, propanol, and acetone are shown to interact with hydrocarbon substrates in a competitive manner in PB-treated male rats, with the solvent producing a type I spectral component. Such solvents are shown to elicit, in addition to the type I component, a modified type II component. In untreated rats, ethanol does not produce a type I component, and also does not affect the apparent association constant for the hydrocarbon substrates when used as a solvent for those substrates. All perturbations of the enzyme which cause a change in the apparent association constant of the substrate also cause a quantitatively similar change in the apparent association of the solvent for the enzyme. A sex difference, with respect to competitive solvent binding, is also observed. Cytochrome P-450 from untreated male rats is apparently unable to bind small polar solvent substrates at the hydrocarbon binding site, whereas untreated female rats possess such an ability. In PB-treated rats, solvent binding is found to be sex-dependent. With respect to PB induction in female rats, the binding affinity for ethanol in the PB-treated animals is significantly larger than that observed in untreated females."
https://openalex.org/W1535253876,"The nucleotide sequence of the cytoplasmic 5 S ribosomal RNA from Spinacia oleracea has been determined. A secondary structural model possessing four base-paired regions can be constructed from the primary structure. This RNA shows 90 to 93% nucleotide sequence homology with other higher plant cytoplasmic 5 S RNAs and 73% homology with that of the lower eukaryote Chlorella. The spinach 5 S RNA has the nucleotide sequence identical with that of Chlorella in two important single-stranded regions, the sequence C10 AUACC and the dodecanucleotide sequence at positions 33 to 44. A nucleotide sequence similar or identical with C10 AUACC is found in most other eukaryotic 5 S RNAs, including the 5 S RNA from human KB cells. In addition, a single-stranded loop of 12 residues corresponding to positions 33 to 44 in the spinach 5 S RNA sequence may be a general feature of eukaryotic cytoplasmic 5 S RNAs, while prokaryotic 5 S RNAs have a 13-member loop for the corresponding residues. Several other important homologies in primary and secondary structure have also been observed in comparing spinach 5 S RNA to other 5 S RNAs."
https://openalex.org/W1557050195,"[3H]2-Aminopurine deoxyribonucleoside triphosphate and [32P]dATP were added exogenously at equimolar concentrations to washed HeLa cell nuclei both in the presence and absence of cell cytoplasm. The observed ratio of 2-aminopurine/adenine deoxyribonucleotide incorporation into DNA was about 12%, which is consistent with 2-aminopurine misinsertion frequencies measured in cell-free assays, for various DNA polymerases including alpha-polymerase from calf thymus, Escherichia coli polymerase I, and several mutant and wild type bacteriophage T4 polymerases. Based on the 12% 2-aminopurine/adenine misincorporation ratio, we propose that proofreading of replicating DNA is not occurring in HeLa nuclei, and that discrimination against 2-aminopurine incorporation is governed primarily by a 1.1 kcal/mol difference in free energy between 2-aminopurine.thymine and adenine.thymine base pairs rather than by properties attributable to either the mammalian DNA polymerase or HeLa cell nuclear replication apparatus."

https://openalex.org/W1581191582,"The collagenase domain of bovine glomerular basement membrane was isolated in soluble form after limited digestion with pepsin. Gel filtration chromatography of the domain under denaturing conditions revealed that most of the polypeptide constituents exhibit apparent molecular weights greater than the type I collagen beta-chain, while approximately 15% are similar in size to that of alpha-chain. Carboxymethyl cellulose chromatography of the alpha-size region revealed that 70% of the protein was polypeptide XIV, as previously designated (West, T. W., Fox, J. W., Jodlowski, M., Freytag, J. W., and Hudson, B. G. (1980) J. Biol. Chem. 255, 10451-10459). This polypeptide exhibits an apparent molecular weight of 102,000 as determined by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. An absolute molecular weight value of 86,000 was determined by sedimentation equilibrium ultracentrifugation in 6 M guanidine hydrochloride. About 15% of the mass is carbohydrate which exists in the form of glucosylgalactosylhydroxylysine. Thus, the polypeptide backbone has a molecular weight of 73,000, a value which is considerably smaller than the alpha-chains of classical collagen. The amino acid and carbohydrate composition and cyanogen bromide patterns indicate that polypeptide XIV has a structure similar to that of C-chain or alpha 1 (IV) collagen which has been identified in other tissues. In addition, the cyanogen bromide pattern of the entire collagenous domain is similar to that of polypeptide XIV, suggesting that the latter is a structural segment of many of the higher molecular weight components."
