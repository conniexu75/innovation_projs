https://openalex.org/W1971706175,Heparin has been chemically combined with a number of plastic surfaces rendering them nonthrombogenic as judged by Lee-White coagulation tests in vitro with human blood. Addition of quaternary ammonium groups to the plastic permitted formation of insoluble complexes with heparin. These heparinized surfaces were essentially nonthrombogenic and adsorb blood proteins to a significantly smaller degree from dilute solution than do the unmodified plastic surfaces. The affinity of the formed blood elements for these modified surfaces is much less than for the unmodified surfaces.

From 128 pronuclear eggs, each injected with 180 or 770 cubic microns of bovine gamma globulin at a concentration of 25 milligrams per milliliter in citrate-Locke's solution and then transferred to the oviducts of pregnant foster mothers, 18 living fetuses developed; from 74 eggs, each injected with 2730 cubic microns, 5 fetuses survived. The living fetuses that developed from the injected eggs were smaller than normal in 6 of 23 surviving experimental fetuses as contrasted to only 1 of 19 control fetuses."

This heavy precipitate represents areas of high Na(+) concentration and may represent the site of a saturated, high-affinity Na(+) carrier. Significantly heavier precipitate occurs at the same site when ouabain is injected into the aqueous humor prior to fixation of the cornea."
https://openalex.org/W1595877015,"Abstract Certain purified antibodies can be distinguished from nonspecific γG-immunoglobulin by optical rotatory dispersion in the ultraviolet region. Thus, inert γG-globulin has troughs at 231 mµ ([R'] = -1320) and 224 mµ ([R') = -1240) while anti-2,4-dinitrophenyl (anti-DNP) antibody of high affinity for ligand has its major trough at 224 mµ ([R'] = -1650). The rotatory dispersion of high affinity anti-2,4,6-trinitrophenyl antibody resembles that of low affinity anti-DNP antibody ([R']224 = -1300). The characteristic optical rotation of anti-DNP antibody does not appear to be related to variation in allotypy or charge. Furthermore, it is not a consequence of the antibody purification procedure. The difference in optical rotation between anti-DNP antibody and inert γG-globulin is confined to Fab, the active fragment produced by papain digestion. The active fragments of both proteins have troughs at 224 mµ, but that of the antibody is deeper. In contrast, the crystallizable fragments, Fc, are virtually identical, with no trough at 224 but with well defined minima at 233 mµ. Despite differences in Cotton effects, inert γG-globulin and anti-DNP antibody, as well as the corresponding pieces obtained by digestion with papain, are very similar in their over-all conformation as shown by sedimentation and molecular weight studies. Therefore, the variation in optical rotation is probably related to very limited structural differences within the γG-immunoglobulins."
https://openalex.org/W1486301594,"Abstract The optical rotatory dispersion of a group of proteins having the Moffitt constant b0 near zero was studied in the far ultraviolet spectral zone. Sodium poly-α-l-glutamate, myoglobin, and serum albumin were used as reference substances. It was found that, in addition to the normal type of rotatory dispersion, as displayed, for example, by myoglobin, four other types of curves could be demonstrated. They are as follows. Type I is represented by phosvitin and the lysine- and proline-rich histone, which are flexible disordered macromolecules. The rotatory dispersion of these proteins is similar to that of disordered polyglutamate. The rotatory power of phosvitin and histone at 198 mµ is near zero. Type II is exemplified by oxidized serum albumin. These curves have two minima, one at 230 to 233 mµ and another at 210 to 215 mµ. The major conformation of oxidized serum albumin seems to be a disordered chain, with a small amount of α helix. Computed curves from data of helical and disordered polyglutamate yielded this type of curve when the helix content was about 25% or less. Type III is represented by chymotrypsinogen, trypsin, and thyrotropin. These proteins have curves with a minimum at 218 to 225 mµ, and they are weakly dextrorotatory at 195 to 200 mµ. It was concluded that these proteins are devoid of complete α-helical strands; instead, they are characterized by some other kind of ordered structures. Type IV curves are observed with serum γ-globulin, the myeloma protein, and Bence-Jones protein. These curves have a shallow minimum at 220 to 225 mµ, a positive maximum at 210 mµ, and a minimum at 198 to 200 mµ. Addition of the disordered polyglutamate or phosvitin to the solutions of the highly α-helical myoglobin or serum albumin did not produce a displacement of the negative minimum at 233 mµ, although the amplitude was diminished. If the ratio of the disordered polymer relative to myoglobin was high, type II curves were obtained. Treatment of chymotrypsinogen with decyl sodium sulfate caused a conformational transition resulting in some α helix formation. The type III curve of chymotrypsinogen was thereby transformed into the ordinary curve of the partially α-helical proteins; i.e. it then possessed a trough at 233 mµ and a peak at 198 mµ. The detergent had a similar effect on the rotatory dispersion of trypsin, Bence-Jones protein, and γ-globulin, but not on the highly charged phosvitin."

https://openalex.org/W1564334227,"Bovine serum albumin prevented the effects of pentachlorophenol, 2,4-dinitrophenol, and various other reagents upon oxidative phosphorylation, the orthophosphate-adenosine triphosphate exchange reaction, adenosine triphosphatase, and respiratory control of rat liver mitochondria. More significantly, albumin restored the capacity for oxidative phosphorylation and the ancillary reactions, including respiratory control, to mitochondria previously reacted with these compounds. Inhibition by gramicidin, oligomycin A, antimycin A, and rotenone was not counteracted by albumin. Oxidative phosphorylation of liver mitochondria uncoupled by the intraperitoneal injection of pentachlorophenol into rats was also restored by albumin. The circulating halophenol after injection was found associated with the albumin fraction of the plasma. The ability of albumin to prevent the deleterious action of the uncoupling reagents, and to restore function to mitochondria treated with them, resides in its capacity to bind these reagents and thereby remove them from the medium or from mitochondria. The beneficial effect is specific for serum albumin. Various other proteins and compounds were found to be ineffective. It was shown that 1 mole of bovine serum albumin can bind 5 moles of pentachlorophenol. Each of these 5 moles is not held with equal affinity, and reversible binding was readily demonstrated. Certain modified albumins, i.e. acetylated, or denatured by chemical or physical means, lost their capacity to bind pentachloro- or 2,4-dinitrophenol. Other modifications, such as blocking sulfhydryl or imidazole groups, did not alter the ability of albumin to bind pentachlorophenol. From these results, evidence is adduced that the native protein structure and especially free amino groups are involved in the protein-phenol interaction. A possible physiological role for the reversible binding of uncoupling reagents to proteins is discussed, as is the use of the phenomenon in studying mitochondrial function and structure."
https://openalex.org/W1540838458,"R. HONG AND A. NISONOFF~ From the Department of Microbiology, University of Illinois, Urbana, Illinois (Received for publication, May 7, 1965) A molecule of rabbit yG-globulin’ evidently consists of four polypeptide chains held together by interchain disulfide bonds and noncovalent interactions. Each molecule comprises a pair of similar or identical “light” chains having an approximate molecular weight of 20,000, and another pair of “heavy” chains of weight 50,000 to 55,000 (2-7). Each light chain is linked to a heavy chain and the two heavy chains are joined to one another (3, 8). The presence of 1 X-carboxymethylcysteine residue per light chain, isolated after reduction and alkylation with iodoace- tate, indicates that a single interchain disulfide bond joins each light chain to a heavy chain (3). Similarly, in a large part if not all of the molecules, reduction of a single disulfide bond is sufficient to permit separation at 10~ pH of half-molecules, each consisting of a light and a heavy chain (9, 10). This is evidently the same disulfide bond that links two “univalent” (Fab’ (1)) fragments after peptic digestion (11). To be consistent with the structural model of Fleischman, Porter, and Press (3), it was necessary to postulate that this bond joins two heavy chains (11). The present investigation provides direct evidence that this is the case. A study was also made of the relative labilities of the disulfide bonds linking light and heavy chains as compared with that of the bond joining half-molecules.2 Conditions for preferential reduction of the H-H disulfide bond, with minimal cleavage of L-H disulfide bonds, were defined. The extent of exchange of light and heavy chains, under the conditions used for separation and hybridization of half-molecules, was estimated. Also, it was found that after reduction of all interchain disulfide bonds, separation into half-molecule subunits occurs under milder conditions than are required for dissociation into separate light and heavy chains."

Stimulation induced a marked release of H(3)-norepinephrine with a threshold and a maximum repsonse. Release also occurred with increased concentrations of potassium, presumably due to neuronal depolarization. Inhibition of electrically induced release occurred with low calcium and with chlorpromazine and pentobarbital."

https://openalex.org/W1491096317,"Abstract Crystallized Fragment Fc of rabbit γG-globulin, prepared by digestion with papain in the presence of 0.05 m l-cysteine, dissociates into half-fragments in 0.05 m NaCl at pH 2.7. Dissociation is approximately half-complete at pH 3.1. The conditions are similar to those required for dissociation of γG-globulin into half-molecules, which supports other evidence that the noncovalent interactions between heavy chains are largely localized in Fragment Fc. Schlieren patterns, molecular weights, and results of gel filtration indicate that two subfractions, approximately equal in size, are liberated. At neutral pH, recombination of the half-fragments occurs spontaneously through noncovalent interaction. After proteolysis in the presence of a low concentration of reducing agent, the resulting crystallized Fc is largely undissociable at low pH but is rendered dissociable by further reduction and alkylation. If alkylation is omitted, after a 1-hour or 4-hour digestion with papain and cysteine, a large proportion of the Fc fragments become undissociable after removal of the reducing agent by dialysis, owing to re-formation of an interchain disulfide bond; dissociability is restored by a second reduction. Prolonged digestion with papain results in a decrease in the S-carboxymethylcysteine content of alkylated Fc fragments, and in loss of the capacity to reoxidize, if alkylation is omitted. A probable explanation is that the enzyme slowly attacks that region of Fragment Fc which contains the interchain disulfide bond."
https://openalex.org/W1986930274,"UP to the present, there has been little information available concerning the rate at which newly synthesized protein hormones may be secreted, following the stimulation of endocrine glands. In recent work on the synthesis of insulin within pancreas slices, in vitro, it became of interest to determine whether or not newly synthesized insulin may be released directly into the incubation medium, or alternatively whether or not release of insulin might be delayed following its accumulation within β-granules. It has already been suggested by Lacy1 that release of insulin from β-cells in response to glucose involves the movement of these granules to the cell surface, where they are released into blood vessels."
https://openalex.org/W1458822178,"Abstract Fatty acid oxidation was studied in the presence or absence of adenosine triphosphate with the use of sodium octanoate-1-14C as substrate. In the absence of ATP, fatty acid oxidation proceeded at a rate 5 to 30% of that obtained in the presence of optimal ATP. The rate of oxidation was partially inhibited by the uncoupling agents dinitrophenol, Dicumarol, or arsenate, completely inhibited by cyanide or antimycin A, and stimulated by oligomycin or azide. The dinitrophenol inhibition was not reversed by oligomycin, although the arsenate inhibition was reversed by oligomycin. Fatty acid oxidation was only slightly inhibited by arsenite, suggesting that substrate level phosphorylation makes only a small contribution to fatty acid activation. In the presence of ATP or ADP, fatty acid oxidation was inhibited both by uncoupling agents and by oligomycin. The oligomycin inhibition was reversed by increasing concentrations of ATP. After preincubation with glucose and hexokinase, the rate of fatty acid oxidation in the absence of ATP was only slightly reduced. Addition of oligomycin reversed this inhibition. Fluoride ion inhibited fatty acid oxidation in the presence of ATP or ADP but had no effect on the oxidative rate in the absence of nucleotides. These results indicate that fatty acids are activated in brain mitochondria by two different mechanisms: (a) an ATP-linked reaction which used primarily the ATP produced during respiration and (b) a system involving high energy intermediates of oxidative phosphorylation."
