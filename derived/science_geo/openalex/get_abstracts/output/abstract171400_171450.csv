In our assays, the activity of UBP43 toward Ub fusions was undetectable in vitro directing us to investigate the possibility of Ub-like proteins such as SUMO, Nedd8, and ISG15 as probable substrates. We consequently demonstrate that UBP43 can efficiently cleave only ISG15 fusions including native ISG15 conjugates linked via isopeptide bonds. In addition to commonly used methods we introduce a new experimental design featuring ISG15-UBP43 fusion self-processing. Deletion of the UBP43 gene in mouse leads to a massive increase of ISG15 conjugates in tissues indicating that UBP43 is a major ISG15-specific protease. UBP43 is the first bona fide ISG15-specific protease reported. Both ISG15 andUBP43 genes are known to be strongly induced by interferon, genotoxic stress, and viral infection. We postulate that UBP43 is necessary to maintain a critical cellular balance of ISG15-conjugated proteins in both healthy and stressed organisms.

Nature. 1979; 279: 523-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar) and later characterized by Knight and co-workers (6Blomstrom D.C. Fahey D. Kutny R. Korant B.D. Knight Jr., E. J. Biol.

Chem. 1988; 263: 4520-4522Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Subsequently, the sequence of ISG15 protein was noted to possess significant homology to a diubiquitin sequence, accounting for its cross-reactivity with affinity purified anti-ubiquitin antibodies (8Haas A.L. Ahrens P. Bright P.M. Ankel H. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 11315-11323Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Several reports demonstrate that ISG15 is released by various cell types and can act as cytokine leading to proliferation of NK cells (9Knight Jr., E. Cordova B. J. Immunol. 1991; 146: 2280-2284PubMed Google Scholar, 10D'Cunha J. Knight Jr., E. Haas A.L. Truitt R.L. Borden E.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Most remarkably, ISG15 was found to be conjugated to intracellular proteins via an isopeptide bond in a manner similar to ubiquitin (Ub), SUMO, and Nedd8 (12Loeb K.R. Haas A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 7806-7813Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Conjugation of ubiquitin-like proteins (Ubls) involves a three-step mechanism whereby specific enzymes (or enzyme complexes) activate and covalently link Ubls to their substrates (13Pickart C.M.

Chem. 1996; 271: 324-330Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar) demonstrated that ISG15 conjugation occurs via a similar but distinct pathway compared with Ub conjugation. Yuan and Krug (3Yuan W. Krug R.M. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 362-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar) discovered that an activating enzyme for ISG15 is UBE1L. Although the role of Ub, Nedd8, and SUMO conjugation has been assessed in numerous studies (16Hochstrasser M. Science. 2000; 289: 563-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 17Hochstrasser M.

Plant Biol. 2000; 3: 381-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar), the biological significance of ISG15 modification remains unknown and the proteins that are targeted by ISG15 have not been identified. It is unknown whether ISG15 conjugates can be targeted to proteasomes in a way similar to Ub conjugates. Alternatively, ISG15 conjugation might antagonize binding of Ub and save proteins from degradation or modify biological activities of targeted proteins as is the case with Nedd8 and SUMO modification (16Hochstrasser M. Science. 2000; 289: 563-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 18Yeh E.T. Gong L. Kamitani T. Gene (Amst.). 2000; 248: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar). Loeb and Haas (21Loeb K.R. Haas A.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 8408-8419Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) demonstrated that a substantial amount of ISG15 conjugates are co-localized with intermediate filaments of the cytoskeleton. It is therefore possible that one of the physiological roles of ISG15 modification is re-organization of the cytoskeleton after IFN stimulation. ISG15 sequences have been reported in fish, chick, and mammals. Despite the presence of Nedd8 and SUMO analogs in yeast, ISG15 is absent from this unicellular eukaryote and, therefore, the ISG15 regulatory pathway is suggested to be a relatively recent functional divergence (22Potter J.L. Narasimhan J. Mende-Mueller L. Haas A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25061-25068Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Our search of fully sequenced genomes of a nematode (Caenorabditis), a plant (Arabidopsis), and an insect (Drosophila) also did not reveal a candidate for an ISG15 ortholog. It is therefore possible that the ISG15-conjugation system is restricted to higher animals with evolved IFN signaling. UBP43 (USP18 in standard nomenclature proposed by Baker et al. (23Baker R.T. Wang X.W. Woollatt E. White J.A. Sutherland G.R. Genomics. 1999; 59: 264-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar)) was initially cloned in our laboratory (24Liu L.Q. Ilaria Jr., R.

Hetherington C.J. Zhang D.E. Genomics. 2000; 65: 44-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) and later, independently by three other groups; cDNA coding for porcine UBP43 was cloned in a differential screen from lung macrophages of virus-infected swine (26Zhang X. Shin J. Molitor T.W. Schook L.B. Rutherford M.S. Virology. 1999; 262: 152-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), Li et al. (27Li X.L. Blackford J.A. Judge C.S. Liu M. Xiao W. Kalvakolanu D.V. Hassel B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8880-8888Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) identified mRNA for human UBP43 in a screen for RNase L substrates, and Kang et al. (28Kang D. Jiang H. Wu Q. Pestka S. Fisher P.B. Gene (Amst.). 2001; 267: 233-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) cloned human UBP43 in a screen for genes induced by IFN in melanoma cell lines. Significant up-regulation of the UBP43 gene by viral infection (or double-stranded RNA), by IFN and lipopolysaccharide 2O. Malakhova, M. Malakhov, C. Hetherington, and D.-E. Zhang, submitted for publication. suggests that UBP43 might be involved in a number of processes including the control of cell proliferation, inflammation, stress, and immune response. Several regions in the UBP43 sequence exhibit homology to catalytic domains of Ub-specific proteases (USPs) which remove Ub from conjugated proteins. The USP family may include more than 100 proteins which differ in size and amino acid sequence, yet all share several highly homologous patches around the residues required for catalytic activity (29Wilkinson K.D. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 1245-1256Crossref PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar, 30Wilkinson K.D. Hochstrasser M. Peters J.M. Harris J.R. Finley D. Ubiquitin and the Biology of the Cell.

Falbel T.G. Durski A.M. Vierstra R.D. Plant Physiol. 2000; 124: 1828-1843Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Using a conventional assay that involves co-transformation of two plasmids into Escherichia coli(first coding for USP enzyme and the second for Ub-β-galactosidase fusion as a substrate), UBP43 was demonstrated to have proteolytic activity against Ub fusion, and was thought to work on Ub conjugates (24Liu L.Q. Ilaria Jr., R. Kingsley P.D. Iwama A. van Etten R.A. Palis J. Zhang D.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 3029-3038Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 25Schwer H. Liu L.Q. Zhou L. Little M.T. Pan Z. Hetherington C.J. Zhang D.E. Genomics. 2000; 65: 44-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). However, our subsequent experiments failed to detect activity of UBP43 toward Ub fusions in vitro. Similarity in the expression patterns of ISG15 and UBP43 genes lead us to hypothesize that ISG15 conjugates may be the preferred substrates for UBP43. We consequently investigated the ability of UBP43 to cleave ISG15 and other known Ub-like proteins (namely SUMO, Nedd8, and Ub) from artificial substrates. Here we demonstrate that UBP43, a member of the Ub-specific protease family, cleaves both artificial and native ISG15 conjugates. No other USPs were specific to ISG15. Therefore, UBP43 is the first ISG15-specific protease reported. Significantly, in vivomouse data also demonstrates that UBP43 is a major ISG15-specific protease and activity of this enzyme is crucial for proper cellular balance of ISG15-conjugated proteins. pcDNA6-UBP43 construct for expression UBP43-V5–6His fusion in mammalian cells has been previously described (25Schwer H. Liu L.Q. Zhou L. Little M.T. Pan Z. Hetherington C.J. Zhang D.E. Genomics. 2000; 65: 44-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Plasmids expressing the ubiquitin-specific proteases UBP41 (as GST fusion), UBP1 (33Tobias J.W. Varshavsky A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 12021-12028Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), Unp, and Unp(mut) (34Gilchrist C.A. Baker R.T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1481: 297-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) as well as pUb-GSTP1 (35Baker R.T. Smith S.A. Marano R. McKee J. Board P.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25381-25386Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) construct were provided by Dr. R. Baker (Australian National University, Canberra). pGEX-Nedd8-gsPESTc and pGEX-SUMO-gsPESTc plasmids were from Dr. K. Tanaka (The Tokyo Metropolitan Institute of Medical Science, Japan) (36Kawakami T. Suzuki T. Baek S.H. Chung C.H. Kawasaki H. Hirano H. Ichiyama A. Omata M. Tanaka K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1999; 126: 612-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). pGEX-ISG15-Rcap and pRSV-ISG17 plasmids were received from Dr. A. L. Haas (Medical Colledge of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, WI). To produce pGEX-ISG15-gsPESTc and pGEX-ISG17-gsPESTc expressing GST-ISG15-gsPESTc or GST-pro-ISG15-gsPESTc, respectively, the plasmid pGEX-Nedd8-gsPESTc was digested withBamHI and the excised Nedd8 was replaced withISG15 or ISG17 that had been PCR amplified from pGEX-ISG15-Rcap or pRSV-ISG17. To produce pET-Ub-gsPESTc plasmid expressing Ub-gsPESTc fusion the gsPESTc-coding sequence was excised from pGEX-Nedd8-gsPESTc using BamHI and EcoRI and cloned into pET-Ub-UBP43-H plasmid (see below) from which UBP43-H encoding sequence had been excised. Construction of pGEX-UBP43 (pGEX-4T-3-UBP43) has been previously described (24Liu L.Q. Ilaria Jr., R. Kingsley P.D. Iwama A. van Etten R.A. Palis J. Zhang D.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 3029-3038Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). pET-S-UBP43-H was produced by cloning of the full-length UBP43 gene into pET29a vector (Novagen, Madison, WI). To generate a construct expressing GST-UBP43–6His the pET-S-UBP43-H was digested withSacI and SmaI restriction endonucleases to excise part of UBP43 together with the fused His6 tag. The resulting SacI-SmaI fragment was cloned into pGEX-UBP43(mut) digested with SacI andNotI (blunted). pET-Ub-UBP43-H and pET-ISG15-UBP43-H constructs expressing the fusions of Ub or ISG15 with UBP43 were produced by replacing the S-tag part in pET-S-UBP43-H (digested with NdeI andEcoR V) with Ub or ISG15 genes that had been PCR amplified from pUb-GSTP1 or pGEX-ISG15-Rcap plasmids. Inactive form of UBP43 was obtained by conversion of a critical cysteine residue (Cys61) into serine by site-directed mutagenesis of pBK/CMV-UBP43 plasmid (previously described (24Liu L.Q. Ilaria Jr., R. Kingsley P.D. Iwama A. van Etten R.A. Palis J. Zhang D.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 3029-3038Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar)) using the QuikChange kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). To convert the constructs expressing the wild-type version of UBP43 into inactive forms, internal SacI-XbaI fragments of theUBP43 gene in the respective constructs were replaced withSacI-XbaI fragments of UBP43(mut) excised from pBK-CMV-UBP43(mut). All constructs generated in the course of this work were sequenced. The plasmids expressing Ubl-gsPESTc constructs were transformed into BL21(DE3) E. coli and the expression was induced with isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. GST-Nedd8-gsPESTc and GST-SUMO-gsPESTc fusions were purified on GSH-agarose (Sigma), digested with thrombin protease (Amersham Biosciences, Inc., Piscataway, NJ) while attached to GSH-agarose beads and the supernatants containing these Ubls-gsPESTc were directly used for labeling. GST-ISG15-gsPESTc fusion was purified on GSH-agarose and eluted with reduced glutathion. After dialysis GST-ISG15-gsPESTc was digested with thrombin protease and the solution containing both GST and ISG15-gsPESTc polypeptides used for labeling. Ub-gsPESTc fusion was purified by heat denaturation, (NH4)2SO4 precipitation and ion-exchange chromatography as described in Kawakami et al.(36Kawakami T. Suzuki T. Baek S.H. Chung C.H. Kawasaki H. Hirano H. Ichiyama A. Omata M. Tanaka K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1999; 126: 612-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The Ubl-gsPESTc fusions were radiolabeled with Na125I (ICN, Costa Mesa, CA) using IODO-BEADS (Pierce, Rockford, IL) for 5 min in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions. The labeling conditions used resulted in almost exclusive labeling of gsPESTc extension. Expression of UBP43 inE. coli as either GST-UBP43 or UBP43–6His fusions produced less than 30% of full-length UBP43. Therefore the UBP43gene was expressed as GST-UBP43–6His fusion (both wild-type and mutant versions). One liter of BL21 E. coli culture transformed with pGEX-UBP43-H plasmid was grown in LB broth toA 600 = 0.8 and protein expression was induced with isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. After 3 h of induction at 21 °C, cells were harvested by centrifugation, washed with PBS, and lysed by sonication in PBS adjusted to 10 mm imidazole, 300 mm NaCl, 2 mmβ-mercaptoethanol, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Lysate was cleared by 10 min centrifugation at 20,000 ×g and GST-UBP43–6His fusions were absorbed on 3 ml of Ni-NTA-agarose (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). After elution with PBS containing 300 mm NaCl, 250 mm imidazole, and 0.1% n-octyl β-d-glucopyranoside, the fusions were absorbed to 0.6 ml of GSH-agarose. The resin was washed with PBS, 0.1% n-octyl β-d-glucopyranoside, resuspended in 10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 30% glycerol and stored at −20 °C until use. All purification procedures were performed at +4 °C. 2 × 106 of 293T cells were seeded on 60-mm cell culture plates and transfected with pcDNA6-UBP43 plasmids using Polyfect reagent (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Thirty-six hours after transfection cells were washed with PBS and harvested into 1 ml of lysis buffer (PBS adjusted to 10 mm imidazole, 0.1% n-octyl β-d-glucopyranoside, 300 mm NaCl, 2 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 2 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 10 μg/ml leupeptin) and then lysed by a 5-s pulse of sonication. Lysate was cleared by a 5-min centrifugation at 16,000 × g and UBP43-V5–6His fusions were absorbed to 40 μl of Ni-NTA-agarose for 1 h. Beads were washed once with 1 ml of PBS adjusted to 300 mm NaCl, 20 mm imidazole, and 0.1% n-octyl β-d-glucopyranoside, twice with the same buffer containing 4 m urea, and twice with the buffer with no urea. Beads were resuspended in 80 μl of 10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 5 mm EDTA, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 20 mm imidazole, and 0.1% n-octyl β-d-glucopyranoside. The suspensions (15 μl per enzymatic reaction, 1 μg of total protein, and 0.1 μg of UBP43 fusion) were immediately used for enzymatic assay. Equal efficiency of expression, and purification between wild-type and mutant UBP43s was confirmed by Western blot with anti-V5 antibodies (Invitrogen). The peptide released from GST-proISG15-gsPESTc by UBP43 proteolytic activity was recovered in a trichloroacetic acid-soluble fraction as previously described (22Potter J.L. Narasimhan J. Mende-Mueller L. Haas A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25061-25068Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 37Woo S.K. Lee J.I. Park I.K. Yoo Y.J. Cho C.M. Kang M.S. Ha D.B. Tanaka K. Chung C.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18766-18773Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). To remove buffer components, which interfere with mass spectroscopic analysis, the peptide was purified on C18-reverse phase matrix (Zip-Tip; Millipore, Bedford, MA). Matrix was equilibrated and washed with 1% (v/v) acetic acid in water and the peptide was eluted into 10 μl of 0.1% (v/v) acetic acid, 75% (v/v) acetonitrile in water. Linear matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI TOF)-mass spectrometry was performed by the Mass Spectrometry Core Facility of The Scripps Research Institute on Voyager-DE work station (PerSeptive Biosystems, Foster City, CA). To assess the ability of Ub-UBP43 and ISG15-UBP43 fusions to undergo self-hydrolysis,E. coli were transformed with pET-Ub-UBP43-H and pET-ISG15-UBP43-H carrying wild-type or inactive versions ofUBP43. Production of UBP43 in E. coli grown in rich media, such as LB, resulted in high yield but massive (more than 70%) degradation of UBP43. On the contrary, growth of E. coli in nutrient-poor medium M9 and induction of expression at low temperature, resulted in production of small quantities of full-length UBP43. Therefore, in this experiment, E. coli cultures were grown in 5 ml of M9 minimal medium to A 600 = 0.8 and induced with isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 4 h at 21 °C. Cells were harvested, lysed by sonication, and after removal of insoluble material at 18,000 × gfor 5 min, supernatants were resolved on 10% SDS-PAGE, electroblotted, and then probed with antibodies against the NH2-terminal part of UBP43. Lungs were surgically removed from euthanized wild-type and UBP43−/−mice (3.5-week old) washed in cold PBS and kept on ice. For preparation of total protein extracts a pair of lungs was homogenized by sonication (four 8-s pulses) in 1 ml of 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma, product number P2714). Triton X-100 and β-mercaptoethanol were added to 1% and 2 mm, respectively, and suspensions were incubated on ice for 10 min. Particulate material was removed by centrifugation at 18,000 ×g for 5 min and supernatants were stored at −80 °C until use. For preparation of cytoskeleton-enriched fraction, lungs combined from three mice were homogenized using a tissue homogenizer in 5 ml of 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 2 mm EGTA, 100 mmNaCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 2 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 10 μg/ml leupeptin. Particulate was collected by centrifugation for 10 min at 16,000 ×g and thoroughly washed twice with 7 ml of the same buffer. The final pellet was then resuspended in 1 ml of 10 mmTris, pH 8.0, 5 mm EDTA, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 2 mm CaCl2, and 0.5% n-octyl β-d-glucopyranoside. The suspension was then briefly sonicated and any insoluble material removed by 10 min centrifugation at 15,000 × g. Supernatant designated as “cytoskeleton-enriched fraction” was stored at −80 °C. Rabbit polyclonal IgGs against human ISG15 were kindly provided by Dr. E. Borden (Cleveland Clinic Foundation, OH) and were used at a final concentration of 0.5 μg/ml (11D'Cunha J. Ramanujam S. Wagner R.J. Witt P.L. Knight Jr., E. Borden E.C. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 4100-4108PubMed Google Scholar). Rabbit anti-serum against Ub was purchased from Sigma and used at 1:300 dilution. For anti-UBP43 antibodies the NH2-terminal part (amino acids 1–120) of murine UBP43 was produced in E. coli as a GST fusion and purified on GSH-agarose. Immunization of rabbits with GST-UBP43(1–120) attached to GSH-agarose was performed at Charles River Pharmservices (Southbridge, MA). Total IgGs were purified on a protein A column (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.) and GST-specific antibodies were removed by passing the total IgG fraction through GST-agarose (Pierce). The resulting IgG fraction was subjected to purification of UBP43-specific antibodies on Affi-Gel resin (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) to which GST-UBP43 fusion protein was coupled. All chromatographic procedures were performed according to the instructions of the respective manufacturers. Proteins were electroblotted onto nitrocellulose membranes (Amersham Biosciences Inc.). Where indicated, membranes were stripped after the first blot in 50 mm Tris, pH 7.0, 2% SDS, and 50 mm dithiothreitol at 55 °C for 30 min. Chemiluminescence system was from PerkinElmer Life Sciences (Boston, MA). Despite significant homology of UBP43 to well characterized Ub-specific proteases and detection of activity in E. coli using Ub-β-galactosidase fusion protein (24Liu L.Q. Ilaria Jr., R. Kingsley P.D. Iwama A. van Etten R.A. Palis J. Zhang D.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 3029-3038Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar), we were not able to detect activity of UBP43 in vitro using a variety of Ub fusions. This fact prompted us to analyze activity of UBP43 toward other major Ubls, namely SUMO, Nedd8, and ISG15. A sensitive assay originally developed by Woo et al. (37Woo S.K. Lee J.I. Park I.K. Yoo Y.J. Cho C.M. Kang M.S. Ha D.B. Tanaka K. Chung C.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18766-18773Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) was selected for this purpose. Each Ubl produced in E. coli had a cleavable carboxyl-terminal extension of the following sequence GSMHISPPEPESEEEEEHYC (referred to as gsPESTc) (36Kawakami T. Suzuki T. Baek S.H. Chung C.H. Kawasaki H. Hirano H. Ichiyama A. Omata M. Tanaka K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1999; 126: 612-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). To avoid covalent modifications to the backbones of Ubls caused by 125I attachment and possible artifacts in the assay we used conditions under which 125I exclusively labels the tyrosine in gsPESTc extension. As a consequence, Ubl-gsPESTc fusion (detectable when intact) after hydrolysis loses the labeled gsPESTc extension and appears as unlabeled and therefore undetectable on autoradiograms. gsPESTc due to its low molecular mass could be detected on Tris-Tricine (38Schagger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10505) Google Scholar) but not on regular SDS-PAGE (39Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207538) Google Scholar). As evidenced by disappearance of the ISG15-gsPESTc band and appearance of the gsPESTc band, UBP43 hydrolyzed only ISG15-gsPESTc and not the Ub-, Nedd8-, or SUMO-gsPESTc fusions (Fig. 1 A). The mutant version of UBP43, in which the cysteine residue critical for activity is converted to serine, was inactive toward any substrate. To confirm this observation with mammalian-expressed UBP43 we transfected 293T cells with either wild-type or mutant His6-tagged UBP43. The wild-type version of UBP43-H purified on Ni-agarose efficiently digested ISG15-gsPESTc fusion while mutated UBP43-H did not (Fig.1 B). Members of USP family including pro-ISG15 processing enzyme (22Potter J.L. Narasimhan J. Mende-Mueller L. Haas A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25061-25068Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) perform cleavage of substrates immediately after LRLRGG motif (identical in Ub and ISG15) yielding functional carboxyl-terminal diglycine available for conjugation. To confirm that hydrolysis catalyzed by UBP43 occurs at the same site, a larger processing reaction similar to that of Fig. 1 B was carried out on unlabeled GST-pro-ISG15-gsPESTc. As evidenced by band shift (Fig.1 C, inset), the incubation of GST-pro-ISG15-gsPESTc with wild-type UBP43-H resulted in removal of the carboxyl-terminal octapeptide extension with gsPESTc peptide (GTEPGGRSGSMHISPPEPESEEEEEHYC) leaving mature ISG15. The released peptide was recovered from the reaction by selective precipitation with trichloroacetic acid (22Potter J.L. Narasimhan J. Mende-Mueller L. Haas A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25061-25068Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 37Woo S.K. Lee J.I. Park I.K. Yoo Y.J. Cho C.M. Kang M.S. Ha D.B. Tanaka K. Chung C.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18766-18773Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) and its exact molecular mass was determined by MALDI analysis. The molecular mass obtained in this experiment (3059 Da; Fig. 1 C) corresponded with the predicted mass (3058.17 Da) of the released peptide suggesting that UBP43 cleaves ISG15 at the expected site following diglycine. The use of ISG15-gsPESTc fusion has never been reported before and UBP43 is the first enzyme to hydrolyze ISG15-gsPESTc. Therefore, to eliminate a possibility of experimental artifacts we tested a yeast (UBP1) and two mammalian USPs (UBP41 and Unp) in an identical assay. None of these three USPs could hydrolyze ISG15-gsPESTc (nor could they hydrolyze Nedd8- or SUMO-gsPESTc, not shown) while, as expected, all three efficiently hydrolyzed Ub-gsPESTc (Fig.2). The results presented in Figs.1 and 2 strongly suggest that UBP43 is an ISG15-specific protease that exhibits no proteolytic activity toward other Ubls. Detection of Ub specific activity in E. colico-transformed with Ub-β-galactosidase and UBP43 expressing constructs contradicted the ISG15-specific activity presented in Fig.1. In a standard co-transformation assay, Ub-β-galactosidase is expressed from low-copy number pACYC plasmid, whereas USPs are expressed from high-copy number plasmids. Such a difference in expression is likely to generate significant excess of enzyme over the substrate which may permit proteolytic activity on Ub fusions even though they are not preferred substrates. We therefore redesigned theE. coli assay to allow one copy of UBP43 to be synthesized per one copy of Ub or ISG15 by making Ub-UBP43 and ISG15-UBP43 fusions. Only ISG15-UBP43(wt) fusion could be efficiently hydrolyzed while expressed in E. coli (Fig. 3). No hydrolysis could be observed when ISG15-UBP43(mut) was expressed and, consistent with in vitro experiments, no hydrolysis was observed when either wild-type or mutated versions of UBP43 were fused to Ub. Use of artificial substrates such as Ub fusions (Ub-carboxyl-terminal extension proteins) in vitro is a commonly used technique, yet, even when an excess of enzyme is used and incubation times are extended, not all USPs that are able to hydrolyze Ub fusions are able to cleave an isopeptide bond, i.e. the bond between the Ub and the sid"

Helicobacter pylori is a highly successful bacterial pathogen of the human stomach. Infection typically leads to a state of chronic inflammation that is frequently associated with diseases like chronic gastritis, peptic ulceration, and sometimes mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma and adenocarcinoma of the stomach (1Cover T.L. Blaser M.J. Gastroenterology. 1999; 117: 257-261Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Among several virulence determinants the H. pyloricytotoxin-associated pathogenicity island (cagPAI) 1cagPAIcytotoxin-associated pathogenicity islandGFPgreen fluorescent proteinPTKprotein-tyrosine kinaseEGFRepidermal growth factor receptor has gained special interest (2Montecucco C. Rappuoli R. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 2: 457-466Crossref Scopus (435) Google Scholar). Strains carrying cagPAI are generally more virulent than strains lacking the island, which often resemble commensal bacteria more than pathogens. Whereas the function of most of the cagPAI genes is unknown, some share significant homology to virB and virD genes known from other Gram-negative pathogens like Agrobacterium tumefaciens and Bordetella pertussis (3Covacci A. Telford J.L. Del Giudice G. Parsonnet J. Rappuoli R. Science. 1999; 284: 1328-1333Crossref PubMed Scopus (957) Google Scholar). These genes encode components of so-called type IV secretion systems that can be regarded as molecular syringes injecting bacterial effector molecules into the cytoplasm of host cells. H. pylori has been shown to possess a functional type IV secretion system that transfers the bacterial CagA protein into gastric epithelial cells where it becomes tyrosine-phosphorylated (4Segal E.D.

Xiang Z. Crabtree J.E. Ghiara P. Borodovsky M. Rappuoli R. Covacci A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 14648-14653Crossref PubMed Scopus (1659) Google Scholar, 10Crabtree J.E.

Microbiol. 2001; 42: 631-644Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). The relevance of CagA tyrosine phosphorylation has been explored by site-directed mutagenesis. Bacteria carrying acagA gene where tyrosine residue 972 (Tyr-972) of the C-terminal EPIYA repeat has been replaced by phenylalanine are unable to rearrange the host cell cytoskeleton (13Backert S. Moese S. Selbach M. Brinkmann V. Meyer T.F. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 42: 631-644Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). This indicated that phosphorylation of the CagA EPIYA motif might be critical for signaling to the actin cytoskeleton. Indeed, recent investigations have demonstrated that the cytoplasmic tyrosine phosphatase Shp-2 is specifically recruited to tyrosine-phosphorylated CagA and is involved in downstream signaling (14Higashi, H., Tsutsumi, R., Muto, S., Sugiyama, T., Azuma, T., Asaka, M., and Hatakeyama, M. (2001) Science10-1126/Science.106747Google Scholar). However, the eukaryotic tyrosine kinase that mediates the initial phosphorylation of CagA has remained enigmatic. Here we show that members of the Src family are cellular CagA kinases both in vitro and in vivo. Recombinant c-Src is able to phosphorylate CagA in vitro. Moreover, specific pharmacological inhibition as well as genetic deletion of Src kinases inhibit the tyrosine phosphorylation of CagA in human fibroblast cells, whereas re-expression of c-Src in a Src-deficient cell re-establishes CagA tyrosine phosphorylation. Sequence analysis suggests that during the co-evolution of humans andH. pylori the CagA protein has evolved as a specific Src kinase substrate. H. pyloristrain P1 is a clinical isolate, and an isogenic ΔcagAknockout mutant was constructed (8Backert S. Ziska E. Brinkmann V. Zimny-Arndt U. Fauconnier A. Jungblut P.R. Naumann M. Meyer T.F. Cell. Microbiol. 2000; 2: 155-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar). Cultivation of H. pylori was on horse serum agar plates under microairophilic conditions according to a standard procedure (8Backert S. Ziska E. Brinkmann V. Zimny-Arndt U. Fauconnier A. Jungblut P.R. Naumann M. Meyer T.F. Cell. Microbiol. 2000; 2: 155-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar). AGS cells (ATCC CRL 1739, a human gastric adenocarcinoma epithelial cell line) were cultivated in 6-well tissue culture dishes using RPMI 1640 medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen) for 2 days to reach monolayers of about 70% confluence. SYF cells were derived from c-src −/−, c-yes −/−, and c-fyn −/− triple knockout mouse embryos and SYF+c-src cells were obtained by stable transfection of SYF cells with mouse c-src (15Klinghoffer R.A. Sachsenmaier C. Cooper J.A. Soriano P. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2459-2471Crossref PubMed Scopus (647) Google Scholar). Both cell lines as well as NIH 3T3 cells were grown in tissue culture flasks in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (PAA Laboratories, Linz, Austria) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% non-essential amino acids. The tyrosine kinase inhibitors AG-370 (Biomol, Plymouth Meeting, PA), AG-1478, and PP2 (Calbiochem, San Diego, CA) were dissolved in Me2SO and added to the cells immediately before infection. Controls were performed with Me2SO alone. H. pylori were suspended in phosphate-buffered saline and added to AGS cells at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 100. After incubation for 5 h the cells were harvested in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline containing 1 mm Na3VO4 (Sigma-Aldrich). H. pylori(A 550 = 0.9) were harvested in ice-cold kinase buffer (25 mm Hepes pH 7.0, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 1% Nonidet P-40, 5 mmdithiothreitol, 1 mm Na3VO4, COMPLETE protease inhibitors (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Mannheim, Germany)) and lysed by 20 passages through a 20-gauche syringe. Five units of recombinant human c-Src (Upstate Technologies, Lake Placid, NY) and 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.) were mixed with 30 μl of the lysate and incubated for 30 min at 30 °C. In a similar experiment, 1 × 107 SYF cells or SYF+c-src cells, respectively, were lysed in 1 ml of ice-cold kinase buffer as described above. 25 μl of cell lysates were incubated with 25 μl of H. pylori lysate and 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP for 10 min. Reactions were stopped by addition of the appropriate amount of 4× reducing sample buffer (200 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 10% β-mercaptoethanol, 10% SDS, 0.4% bromphenol blue, 40% glycerol) and boiled for 5 min. A C-terminal cagA fragment encoding EPIYA motifs and the Y972F mutant was cloned into the pEGFP-N1 expression vector as an N-terminal fusion to GFP as described (13Backert S. Moese S. Selbach M. Brinkmann V. Meyer T.F. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 42: 631-644Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). This fragment corresponds to positions 872–1000 of CagA from the TIGR strain (www.tigr.org/tdb/). Mouse c-src and constitutively activesrc in the mammalian retroviral expression vector pNeoMSV (16Karn J. Watson J.V. Lowe A.D. Green S.M. Vedeckis W.

All constructs were transiently transfected into AGS, SYF, and SYF+c-src cells using LipofectAMINE 2000 according to the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen). Cells were incubated at 37 °C under 5% CO2 for 16 h and were harvested and subjected to SDS-PAGE. Western blots were probed with a monoclonal phosphotyrosine-specific antibody PY99 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), a monoclonal anti-Src antibody (18Lipsich L.A. Lewis A.J. Brugge J.S. J. Virol. 1983; 48: 352-360Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), anti-Src antibody GD11 (Upstate Technologies), or polyclonal anti-c-Yes and anti-c-Fyn antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). As a control, we used a monoclonal anti-α-tubulin antibody (Sigma-Aldrich). GFP expression was analyzed with a polyclonal anti-GFP antibody (MoBiTec, Göttingen, Germany). CagA was detected with a polyclonal rabbit anti-CagA antibody (6Stein M. Rappuoli R. Covacci A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 1263-1268Crossref PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar). Two bacterial virulence proteins, CagA and Tir from the human pathogen H. pylori and enteropathogenicEscherichia coli (EPEC), respectively, undergo tyrosine phosphorylation. Phosphorylation of both proteins interferes with host cell signaling events and induces rearrangements of the actin cytoskeleton (4Segal E.D. Cha J., Lo, J. Falkow S. Tompkins L.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 14559-14564Crossref PubMed Scopus (672) Google Scholar, 13Backert S. Moese S. Selbach M. Brinkmann V. Meyer T.F. Mol.

Although the initial tyrosine phosphorylation step is crucial, the eukaryotic kinases that phosphorylate both Tir and CagA have not yet been identified. Here, we have analyzed the phosphorylation of the H. pyloriCagA protein by a combination of in vivo and in vitro experiments, which show that Src is the kinase. In general, protein-tyrosine kinases (PTKs) are thought to bind and phosphorylate their substrates depending on the amino acid sequence surrounding the respective tyrosine residue (20Songyang Z. Carraway III K.L. Eck M.J. Harrison S.C. Feldman R.A. Mohammadi M. Schlessinger J. Hubbard S.R. Smith D.P. Eng C. Lorenzo M.J. Ponder B.A.J. Mayer B.J. Cantley L.C.

For example, receptor-tyrosine kinases prefer acidic amino acids at the −1 position and bulky lipophilic side chains at the +1 position. On the other hand, the Src family PTKs target tyrosines between an N-terminal lipophilic and a C-terminal small or acidic amino acid (20Songyang Z. Carraway III K.L. Eck M.J. Harrison S.C. Feldman R.A. Mohammadi M. Schlessinger J. Hubbard S.R. Smith D.P. Eng C. Lorenzo M.J. Ponder B.A.J. Mayer B.J. Cantley L.C. Nature. 1995; 373: 536-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (848) Google Scholar). We have previously reported that Tyr-972, but not Tyr-122, Tyr-899, or Tyr-918 of CagA from the TIGR H. pylori strain, is essential for phosphorylation (13Backert S. Moese S. Selbach M. Brinkmann V. Meyer T.F. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 42: 631-644Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Homology searches of this motif revealed that Tyr-972 is well conserved in so-called Glu-Pro-Ile-Tyr-Ala (EPIYA) sequence repeats that were first reported to be a major cause of CagA size variation (22Covacci A. Censini S. Bugnoli M. Petracca R. Burroni D. Macchia G. Massone A. Papini E. Xiang Z. Figura N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5791-5795Crossref PubMed Scopus (1121) Google Scholar). Among 27 CagA variants that were selected from the NCBI data base, EPIYA repeats were present in all proteins but at different numbers (Fig. 1 A). The majority of CagA sequences had at least three EPIYA motifs whereas some contained up to five repeats, indicating that this motif is probably of general importance. To reveal if this motif can be recognized by specific kinases, we aligned the EPIYA sequence with consensus target sequences of eukaryotic tyrosine kinases. The EPIYA motif has isoleucine at the −1 position and the small amino acid alanine at the +1 position, which is closely related to the Src phosphorylation consensus motif EEIY(G/E) (Fig. 1 B), suggesting that CagA may be a substrate for tyrosine kinases of the Src family. Interestingly, Asahi et al. (5Asahi M. Azuma T. Ito S. Ito Y. Suto H. Nagai Y. Tsubokawa M. Tohyama Y. Maeda S. Omata M. Suzuki T. Sasakawa C. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 191: 593-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar) reported that epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase can also phosphorylate CagA in vitro. However, the EPIYA motif shows only weak homology to the EGFR consensus sequence (Fig.1 B). To determine whether Src family PTKs are important for CagA phosphorylation, we infected AGS gastric epithelial cells in the presence of PP2, a Src-specific tyrosine kinase inhibitor (23Hanke J.H. Gardner J.P. Dow R.L. Changelian P.S. Brissette W.H. Weringer E.J. Pollok B.A. Connelly P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 695-701Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1790) Google Scholar). After 5 h, whole cell lysates were prepared and analyzed by anti-phosphotyrosine and anti-CagA immunoblotting. Treatment with PP2 reduced CagA phosphorylation in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 2 A, upper panel). Even at low concentration (1 μm) PP2 reduced CagA phosphorylation significantly, and CagA phosphorylation was not detectable at 100 μm PP2. Treatment of uninfected AGS cells did not significantly affect tyrosine phosphorylation of most host proteins, demonstrating that PP2 inhibits a specific subset of kinases rather than blocking tyrosine phosphorylation in general (Fig.2 A, upper panel). To demonstrate that equal amounts of CagA and host cell proteins are present, the blots were reprobed with an anti-CagA antibody (middle panel) or anti-α-tubulin antibody (lower panel), respectively. Furthermore, treatment of infected AGS cells with tyrphostins AG1478 (24Levitzky A. Gazit A. Science. 1995; 267: 1782-1788Crossref PubMed Scopus (1628) Google Scholar) or AG370 (25Levitzky A. Gilon C. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1991; 12: 171-174Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar) as specific inhibitors of EGFR and platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR) tyrosine kinases, respectively, had no effect on the phosphorylation of CagA during infection even at high doses (Fig. 2 B). Thus, CagA is phosphorylated in vivo by a PP2-sensitive host cell kinase that is different from EGFR and PDGFR. CagA tyrosine phosphorylation has been implicated in signaling events leading to the hummingbird phenotype in AGS cells (4Segal E.D. Cha J., Lo, J. Falkow S. Tompkins L.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 14559-14564Crossref PubMed Scopus (672) Google Scholar, 13Backert S. Moese S. Selbach M. Brinkmann V. Meyer T.F. Mol.

(2001) Science10-1126/Science.106747Google Scholar). Thus, we analyzed the effect of PP2 on the induction of phenotype changes in infected AGS cells. In the absence of inhibitor, more than 55% of the infected cells were significantly elongated and displayed a spindle-shaped morphology (Fig. 2 C). In the presence of 1 μm PP2 the appearance of this phenotypic alteration was reduced to 25% of the cell population. At 100 μm PP2, infected cells did not show the cellular phenotype, and the number of elongated cells dropped to less than 5% (Fig. 2 C). This result verifies very recent reports (13Backert S. Moese S. Selbach M. Brinkmann V. Meyer T.F. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 42: 631-644Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar, 14Higashi, H., Tsutsumi, R., Muto, S., Sugiyama, T., Azuma, T., Asaka, M., and Hatakeyama, M. (2001) Science10-1126/Science.106747Google Scholar) demonstrating that CagA tyrosine phosphorylation is necessary to induce downstream signaling leading to the hummingbird phenotype. In the micromolar range, PP2 is regarded as a specific Src family PTK inhibitor (23Hanke J.H. Gardner J.P. Dow R.L. Changelian P.S. Brissette W.H. Weringer E.J. Pollok B.A. Connelly P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 695-701Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1790) Google Scholar). However, the possibility that the inhibitory effect of PP2 on CagA phosphorylation in AGS cells may be due to a partial inhibition of other cellular tyrosine kinases cannot be excluded. To verify that Src PTK activity has an impact on CagA phosphorylation in AGS cells we transfected these cells with a c-Src construct, infected them with H. pylori, and analyzed CagA phosphorylation by immunoblotting (Fig.3 A, upper andmiddle panels). CagA phosphorylation in AGS cells overexpressing c-Src was substantially increased when compared with control AGS cells expressing only endogenous Src levels. An even stronger increase in CagA phosphorylation was obtained when AGS cells were transfected with constitutively active Src (data not shown). Therefore, increasing Src family PTK activity (Fig. 3 A,bottom) strongly enhances CagA phosphorylation in AGS cells, indicating that c-Src is an in vivo kinase of this protein. Interestingly, the ability of activated Src variants to induce changes in the cellular morphology has been well documented in other cell types such as fibroblasts (26Tian M. Martin G.S. Mol. Biol.

To confirm that CagA can function as a c-Src substrate we performedin vitro kinase assays using recombinant human c-Src incubated with lysates from wild-type and CagA-deficient H. pylori in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP. The lysates were resolved by SDS-PAGE, and CagA phosphorylation was detected by autoradiography (Fig. 3 B, upper panel). In a parallel experiment, these samples were blotted and probed with an anti-CagA antibody (Fig. 3 B, lower panel). Strong phosphorylation of CagA was detected when c-Src was co-incubated with lysate from wild-type H. pylori. Bacterial lysate without c-Src was unable to phosphorylate CagA. As expected, incubation of c-Src with an isogenic H. pylori ΔcagA knockout mutant did not result in CagA phosphorylation. These results demonstrate that CagA serves as a c-Src substrate in vitro. To further investigate the role of Src family PTKs for in vivo CagA phosphorylation we employed fibroblasts derived from c-src −/− ,c-yes −/−, and c-fyn −/− triple knockout mouse embryos (SYF cells) (15Klinghoffer R.A. Sachsenmaier C. Cooper J.A. Soriano P. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2459-2471Crossref PubMed Scopus (647) Google Scholar). As a control, SYF cells stably re-expressing c-Src were used (SYF+c-src) (Fig.4 A). Because H. pylori was unable to translocate CagA into these cells, we first prepared cell lysates and performed in vitro CagA phosphorylation assays as described above. Whereas SYF cell lysates did not support CagA phosphorylation, lysates prepared from SYF+c-src cells strongly induced CagA tyrosine phosphorylation (Fig. 4 B, arrowhead). Reprobing of the blot with an anti-CagA antibody showed identical CagA amounts present (data not shown). This result indicated that cellular Src family PTKs (in particular Src, Yes, or Fyn) are essential for CagA phosphorylation. To determine which of these Src family members are expressed in AGS gastric epithelial cells we probed whole cell lysates with antibodies to c-Src, c-Yes, and c-Fyn (Fig. 4 C). NIH 3T3 fibroblasts were used as a positive control (right lanes). We found that c-Src and c-Yes are strongly expressed in AGS cells whereas c-Fyn expression was very low (Fig. 4 C,arrowheads). This indicated that the Src family members c-Src and/or c-Yes might be major kinases of CagA in vivo. To prove that Src family kinases mediate CagA phosphorylation in vivo, we fused a 15-kDa C-terminal CagA fragment containing the EPIYA motifs to green fluorescent protein (EPIYA-GFP, see Fig.1 B). In addition, we generated a construct in which Tyr-972 of the C-terminal EPIYA repeat has been replaced by phenylalanine (EPIFA-GFP). These constructs were transiently expressed in SYF and SYF+c-src cells, and phosphorylation of the EPIYA/EPIFA-GFP fusion proteins was determined by immunoblotting (Fig.5, upper panel). Expression levels of the constructs were determined using an anti-GFP antibody (Fig. 5, middle panel). To assure that equal amounts of protein were present in each lane the blot was reprobed with an anti-α-tubulin antibody. Significantly, we observed a very faint band for phosphorylated wild-type EPIYA-GFP protein in SYF cells (only after long exposure times) and no signal for the EPIFA-GFP construct. However, SYF+c-src cells revealed strong phosphorylation of the wild-type EPIYA-GFP fusion construct and a faint band for the phosphorylated EPIFA-GFP protein. Densitometric analysis of CagA-GFP expression and tyrosine phosphorylation levels revealed that SYF+c-src cells induced more than 30-fold stronger phosphorylation of the CagA-GFP fusion protein than SYF cells. Thus, Src family kinases contribute to the majority of CagA phosphorylationin vivo, and c-Src re-expression in SYF cells is sufficient to mediate CagA tyrosine phosphorylation in vivo. Moreover, Tyr-972 of the distal EPIYA repeat of CagA from the TIGR strain appears to be the major Src kinase phosphorylation site within the CagA sequence. CagA is regarded as an important H. pylori virulence factor that induces a transformed phenotype upon translocation into gastric epithelial cells. A recent report has shown that the phosphatase Shp-2 binds CagA in a phosphotyrosine-dependent manner and plays a role in downstream signaling (14Higashi, H., Tsutsumi, R., Muto, S., Sugiyama, T., Azuma, T., Asaka, M., and Hatakeyama, M. (2001) Science10-1126/Science.106747Google Scholar). Here, we identify Src family kinases as additional host cell proteins that specifically interact with CagA. Inhibition of Src with the specific inhibitor PP2 prevents phosphorylation of CagA and CagA-dependent cytoskeletal rearrangements. As phosphorylation precedes virtually all effects induced by CagA, phosphorylation of CagA by Src-like PTKs is likely to be the initial event critically involved in CagA-induced host cell signaling. Furthermore, we identified a conserved EPIYA motif in CagA as a specific Src target site. CagA sequences from other H. pylori isolates contain varying numbers of EPIYA repeats that could allow for multiple phosphorylation events. Given that CagA phosphorylation is essential for modulating cellular functions,H. pylori would potentially be able to modify the effects of CagA by varying the number of EPIYA repeats. It is tempting to speculate that the number of phosphorylation sites present in CagA correlates with the degree of pathogenic effects induced during infection with H. pylori. We thank Julia Blass and Christian Sommer for excellent technical assistance. We thank Antonello Covacci and Stefano Censini (Chiron, Siena, Italy) for providing an anti-CagA antiserum, Tony Hunter (Salk Institute, La Jolla, CA) for the c-Src expression construct, and Phil Soriano (FHCRC, Seattle, WA) for the SYF cells."

https://openalex.org/W2057410086,"The integrin alpha(2)-subunit was ablated in mice by targeted deletion of the ITGA2 gene. alpha(2)-Deficient animals develop normally, are fertile, and reproduce. Surprisingly, no obvious anatomical or histological differences were observed in mutant mice. Besides its significance in tissue morphogenesis, integrin alpha(2)beta(1) has been reported to play a major role in hemostasis by mediating platelet adhesion and activation on subendothelial collagen. To define its role in hemostasis, alpha(2)-deficient platelets were analyzed for their capacity to adhere to and aggregate in response to fibrillar or soluble collagen type I. We show that aggregation of alpha(2)-deficient platelets to fibrillar collagen is delayed but not reduced, whereas aggregation to enzymatically digested soluble collagen is abolished. Furthermore, alpha(2)-deficient platelets normally adhere to fibrillar collagen. However, in the presence of an antibody against GPVI (activating platelet collagen receptor), adhesion of alpha(2)-deficient but not wild type platelets is abrogated. These results demonstrate that integrin alpha(2)beta(1) significantly contributes to platelet adhesion to (fibrillar) collagen, which is further confirmed by the abolished adhesion of alpha(2)-deficient platelets to soluble collagen. Thus, alpha(2)beta(1) plays a supportive rather than an essential role in platelet-collagen interactions. These results are in agreement with the observation that alpha(2)beta(1)-deficient animals suffer no bleeding anomalies."

There are nucleocytoplasmic enzymes for the attachment and removal ofO-GlcNAc. Here, we further characterize the recently cloned β-N-acetylglucosaminidase, O-GlcNAcase. Both recombinant and purified endogenous O-GlcNAcase rapidly release free GlcNAc from O-GlcNAc-modified peptide substrates. The recombinant enzyme functions as a monomer and has kinetic parameters (Km = 1.1 mm for paranitrophenyl-GlcNAc, kcat = 1 s−1) that are similar to those of lysosomal hexosaminidases. The endogenous O-GlcNAcase appears to be in a complex with other proteins and is predominantly localized to the cytosol. Overexpression of the enzyme in living cells results in decreased O-GlcNAc modification of nucleocytoplasmic proteins. Finally, we show that the enzyme is a substrate for caspase-3 but, suprisingly, the cleavage has no effect on in vitro O-GlcNAcase activity.

In each case studied, the glycan has a turnover rate that is much faster than that of the protein to which it is attached (4Chou C.F. Omary M.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4465-4472Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 5Roquemore E.P. Chevrier M.R. Cotter R.J. Hart G.W. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 3578-3586Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). The O-GlcNAc modification of certain proteins is modulated by various extracellular stimuli and growth conditions (6Kearse K.P. G. W. H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 1701-1705Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar, 7Griffith L.S. Schmitz B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 262: 824-832Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Thus, based on its dynamic and inducible nature, O-GlcNAc is most likely a regulatory modification, more similar to phosphorylation than to classical glycosylation (8Wells L. Vosseller K. Hart G.W. Science. 2001; 291: 2376-2378Crossref PubMed Scopus (803) Google Scholar). In further support of this hypothesis, there are nucleocytoplasmic enzymes for the attachment (O-GlcNAc transferase, OGT) and for the removal (O-GlcNAcase) of O-GlcNAc, analogous to the kinases and phosphatases for phosphate. The protein uridine diphospho-N-acetylglucosamine: polypeptide β-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase (OGT) has been cloned and characterized in our laboratory and others (10Kreppel L.K. Blomberg M.A. Hart G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9308-9315Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (604) Google Scholar, 11Lubas W.A. Frank D.W. Krause M. Hanover J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9316-9324Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar). OGT is highly conserved from Caenorhabditis elegans to humans and is essential for mouse embryonic stem cell viability (12Shafi R. Iyer S.P. Ellies L.G. O'Donnell N. Marek K.W. Chui D. Hart G.W. Marth J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 5735-5739Crossref PubMed Scopus (593) Google Scholar). OGT contains multiple tetratricopeptide repeats that appear to mediate the enzyme's trimerization, substrate recognition, and protein-protein interactions (13Kreppel L.K. Hart G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32015-32022Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar, 14Lubas W.A. Hanover J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10938-10943Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (255) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the enzyme is modified by tyrosine phosphorylation, as well as O-GlcNAc (10Kreppel L.K. Blomberg M.A. Hart G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9308-9315Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (604) Google Scholar). A variety of splice variants of this enzyme appear in the National Center for Biotechnology Information data base, but they have not been examined. The enzyme is also exquisitely responsive to the concentration of UDP-GlcNAc, the donor sugar nucleotide (13Kreppel L.K. Hart G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32015-32022Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). This multitude of protein-binding domains, post-translational modifications, splice variants, and substrate sensitivity could allow for an intricate and complex regulation of the transferase. Recently, we have cloned the nucleocytoplasmic β-N-acetylglucosaminidase, O-GlcNAcase (15Gao Y. Wells L. Comer F.I. Parker G.J. Hart G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 9838-9845Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar). This enzyme most likely represents the human hexosaminidase C observed by others (16Beutler E. Kuhl W. Ann. Hum. Genet. 1977; 41: 163-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar, 17Overdijk B. VanderKroef W.M. VanSteijn G.J. Lisman J.J. Biochim. Biophys.

Wells L. Comer F.I. Parker G.J. Hart G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 9838-9845Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar). In contrast, lysosomal hexosaminidases (A and B) have acidic pH optima, are localized to the lumen of the lysosome, and are inhibited by both GlcNAc and GalNAc (19Mahuran D. Novak A. Lowden J.A. Curr. Top. Biol. Med. Res. 1985; 12: 229-288PubMed Google Scholar). In this report, we further characterizeO-GlcNAcase in regard to its functional state, associations with other proteins, kinetic parameters, subcellular localization, and its cleavage by the apoptotic executioner protease, caspase-3. The human O-GlcNAcase cDNA was subcloned into the commercial expression bacterial expression vector PET32a (Novagen, Madison, WI), as was the shorter splice variant (MGEA5 s), to yield fusion proteins with thioredoxin. Both constructs were confirmed by sequencing. Recombinant enzyme was expressed and purified by nickel chromatography according to the manufacturer's protocol. To further purify the enzyme, the protein was purified over a PD-10 Mono-Q column using a linear salt gradient. Purification of endogenousO-GlcNAcase from bovine brain has been described previously (15Gao Y. Wells L. Comer F.I. Parker G.J. Hart G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 9838-9845Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar). A polyclonal antibody was generated for us by Spring Valley Labs (Woodbine, MD) using a peptide, SKLGCFFIAKMEGFPKDV, from the C terminus ofO-GlcNAcase. This antibody was antigen affinity-purified using the glutathione S-transferase-tagged C terminus ofO-GlcNAcase. Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and then transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride for immunoblotting. Primary antibodies, anti-O-GlcNAcase and the O-GlcNAc specific antibody 110.6 2Under a licensing agreement between Covance Research Products and The Johns Hopkins University, Dr. Hart receives a share of royalty received by the university on sales of the CTD 110.6 antibody.

Anal. Biochem. 2001; 293: 169-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar), were used at 1:3,000 dilution. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit (Amersham Biosciences) for anti-O-GlcNAcase, or horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgM (Sigma) for 110.6, were used as the secondary antibodies. Blots were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence according to the manufacturer's protocol (Amersham Biosciences). Gels were visualized by Coomassie Blue G-250 or silver staining as previously described (21Neuhoff V. Arold N. Taube D. Ehrhardt W. Electrophoresis. 1988; 9: 255-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (2350) Google Scholar, 22Blum Electrophoresis. 1987; 8: 93-99Crossref Scopus (3739) Google Scholar). Whole cell extracts and cell fractionation were performed exactly as previously described (15Gao Y. Wells L. Comer F.I. Parker G.J. Hart G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 9838-9845Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar). Protein content was determined using the Bio-Rad protein assay. Samples were injected onto a Superose 6 (0.5 × 30 cm) column equilibrated in 20 mmTris (pH 7.5), 1 mm dithiothreitol, 150 mm NaCl at a flow rate of 40 μl/min using a SMART system HPLC (Amersham Biosciences). Fractions were digested with modified trypsin (SEQZ, Worthington, Freehold, NJ). The digested fractions were acidified and analyzed by capillary reverse phase C18 high pressure liquid chromatography with in-line tandem MS/MS on a Finnigan LCQ ion-trap mass spectrometer. Proteins were identified using the TurboSEQUEST algorithm (Finnigan, Metuchen, NJ) with a minimum of four sequenced tryptic peptides for identification of each protein. O-GlcNAcase activity was measured directly using two different substrates. The glycopeptide A-S(-O-GlcNAc)-Y was synthesized using standardN-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl (FMOC) chemistry. The synthetic substrate PNP-GlcNAc was purchased (Sigma). For measuringO-GlcNAcase activity of purified and recombinantO-GlcNAcase with the peptide as the substrate, we measured the release of free GlcNAc using the Elson-Morgan assay (23Elson L.A. Morgan W.T.J. Biochem. J. 1933; 27: 1824-1829Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). FreeN-acetylglucosamine was used to generate a standard curve. For assays with PNP-GlcNAc, we used the established protocol previously described (15Gao Y. Wells L. Comer F.I. Parker G.J. Hart G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 9838-9845Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar). For kinetic measurements, the amount of PNP-GlcNAc was varied. 1 pmol of recombinant enzyme was used in each assay for kinetics (an amount that resulted in an absorbance within the linear range of the assay), and all assays were performed in quadruplicate. COS-7 cells were maintained and transiently transfected as previously described (15Gao Y. Wells L. Comer F.I. Parker G.J. Hart G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 9838-9845Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar). CHO-K1 cells were maintained in 10% fetal bovine serum in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium in 5% CO2 at 37 °C. 50–75% confluent CHO-K1 cells were fixed in 4% (v/v) formaldehyde, washed four times in phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.5 (PBS), and permeabilized in 0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS. Cells were washed in PBS, blocked with 3% (w/v) bovine serum albumin in PBS, and then incubated in primary antibody. After four PBS washes, the cells were incubated in secondary antibody and then washed and visualized. Secondary antibody (fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG from Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories) alone gave no signal. [35S]Met-labeled recombinant O-GlcNAcase was prepared by in vitrotranscription/translation (Promega). Labeled O-GlcNAcase was diluted with ICE assay buffer (10 mm Hepes KOH pH 7.4, 2 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, 5 mm dithiothreitol) and incubated with recombinant human caspase-3 (a kind gift of Nancy Thornberry, Merck Research Laboratories) in a final reaction volume of 25 μl for 60 min at 37 °C. Cleavage of [35S]Met-labeled poly(ADP-ribose)polymerase (PARP) was performed in parallel for comparison. Reactions were terminated by addition of SDS-PAGE sample buffer and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and fluorography. Values forkcat/Km were determined from densitometric scans of films based on a first-order rate equation. Recombinant O-GlcNAcase was cleaved in ICE assay buffer with 40 or 200 nm caspase-3 for varying amounts of time, and the reaction was terminated by the addition of SDS-PAGE sample buffer. The purification of nativeO-GlcNAcase from cow brain that has been previously described (15Gao Y. Wells L. Comer F.I. Parker G.J. Hart G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 9838-9845Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar) results in a complex of approximately 10 proteins (Fig.1A, lane 2). Identification and cloning of this enzyme allowed us to overexpress human O-GlcNAcase as a fusion protein with thioredoxin in anE. coli expression system. This recombinant protein was purified by nickel-affinity and ion-exchange chromatography to yield an enzyme preparation for subsequent experiments (Fig.1A, lane 2). To facilitate the study of this enzyme, we generated a rabbit polyclonal antibody to a C-terminal peptide of the enzyme. This antibody recognizes recombinant and endogenous O-GlcNAcase (Fig. 1B). To confirm that the recombinant enzyme is active, we incubated equal amounts of the enzyme preparations with the glycopeptide A-S(O-GlcNAc)-Y and measured the release of free GlcNAc via the Elson-Morgan method (see “Experimental Procedures”). Both endogenous and recombinant O-GlcNAcase preparations contained significant and similar levels of activity (Fig.1C). Most hexosaminidases characterized to date are multimeric (24Muzzarelli R.A. EXS. 1999; 87: 235-247PubMed Google Scholar). To investigate the state of active O-GlcNAcase, we estimated the size of recombinantO-GlcNAcase by native size exclusion chromatography (Fig.2A). The recombinant enzyme ran as a monomer with an estimated molecular mass of 140 kDa, in agreement with SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1, A and B), previous sedimentation studies by Dong and Hart (25Dong D.L. Hart G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19321-19330Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the predicted molecular weight of the fusion protein. Native O-GlcNAcase activity and protein, purified from cow brain, migrated in a complex of ∼600 kDa (Fig. 2, A andB) on the same size exclusion column. Several of the proteins in the cow brain preparation have previously been identified by MS/MS (15Gao Y. Wells L. Comer F.I. Parker G.J. Hart G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 9838-9845Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar). To further characterize this complex, we digested fractions 2 (which contained the most O-GlcNAcase activity and protein, Fig. 2) and 6 (which contained no significantO-GlcNAcase activity, but produced a second peak by 214 nm absorbance in the chromatogram, Fig. 2) from the size exclusion column with trypsin. The peptides in the digested mixture were subjected to capillary reverse phase C18 HPLC-nanospray-MS/MS and the proteins were identified using TurboSequest. As previously identified, O-GlcNAcase copurified with HSP110, HSC70, amphiphysin, and dihydropyriminidase-related protein-2 (DRP-2) (15Gao Y. Wells L. Comer F.I. Parker G.J. Hart G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 9838-9845Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar). We also identified calcineurin in fraction 2 (four sequenced peptides with a mass coverage of 9%, data not shown). In fraction 6, we identified TIP120, HSP110, cullin, and HSC70 but not O-GlcNAcase. This strongly suggests that O-GlcNAcase does not associate with TIP120 and cullin, two proteins that we had previously identified as copurifying with O-GlcNAcase (15Gao Y. Wells L. Comer F.I. Parker G.J. Hart G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 9838-9845Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar). Because recombinantO-GlcNAcase is monomeric (Fig. 2A), we believe that native O-GlcNAcase must be in a complex with some, if not all, of the proteins identified in fraction 2. We next wanted to determine the kinetic parameters for O-GlcNAcase. Because of the sensitivity of the Elson-Morgan assay, the amounts of glycopeptide and enzyme needed for complete characterization were not practical. We therefore used PNP-GlcNAc as an alternative substrate. This colorimetric compound and the related fluorescent compound MUG have been used extensively for the characterization of hexosaminidases (17Overdijk B. VanderKroef W.M. VanSteijn G.J. Lisman J.J.

Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 6219-6227Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Kinetic analysis of the recombinant enzyme established a Km of 1.1 mm for PNP-GlcNAc and a specific activity of 652 nmol/min/mg with a turnover rate of approximately once per second (Fig.3). These kinetic values are very comparable (within a factor of 3) to several characterized hexosaminidases (26Fernandes M.J.G. Yew S. Leclerc D. Henrissat B. Vorgias C.E. Gravel R.A. Hechtman P.

O-GlcNAcase protein levels were raised approximately an order of magnitude (Fig.4A) with an equivalent increase in activity, measured at pH 6.4 in the presence of 50 mm GalNAc to inhibit Hex A and Hex B (data not shown). Equivalent amounts of these same extracts were examined forO-GlcNAc levels by Western blotting with theO-GlcNAc specific antibody 110.6 (20Comer F.I. Vosseller K. Wells L. Accavitti M.A. Hart G.W.

O-GlcNAc levels were greatly reduced on proteins when O-GlcNAcase was overexpressed (Fig. 4B), supporting its proposed role inO-GlcNAc cycling (15Gao Y. Wells L. Comer F.I. Parker G.J. Hart G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 9838-9845Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar). The localization of endogenous O-GlcNAcase in CHO-K1 cells was investigated via indirect immunofluorescence with theO-GlcNAcase antibody. O-GlcNAcase exhibited a predominantly diffuse cytosolic localization with punctate staining in the nucleus (Fig. 5A). Biochemical fractionation of the CHO-K1 cells revealed that the majority of the total O-GlcNAcase activity (90%) was in the cytosol (Fig. 5B), and anti-O-GlcNAcase Western blotting gave similar findings (data not shown). We observed upon Western blotting with the O-GlcNAcase antibody that overexpression ofO-GlcNAcase in COS-7 cells resulted in the overexpression of a 65-kDa band in addition to the full-length O-GlcNAcase (Fig. 4A). Because this immunoreactive 65-kDa band was present endogenously as well as in cells overexpressing the enzyme, we concluded that it must be a proteolytic fragment or the protein resulting from an internal start site. Because there was no obvious internal start site that would result in a protein of the appropriate size, we tested a variety of proteases, including caspase-3, -6, -7, -8, -9 and granzyme-B, for their ability to cleave recombinantO-GlcNAcase (data not shown). We found that only caspase-3 efficiently cleaved O-GlcNAcase, generating a 65-kDa fragment upon anti-O-GlcNAcase Western blotting (Fig.6A). Because our antibody was raised to a C-terminal peptide, the fragment observed on the Western blot is the C terminus of O-GlcNAcase. To further examine the kinetics of this cleavage, [35S]Met-labeledO-GlcNAcase and poly(ADP-ribose)polymerase (PARP), an established caspase-3 substrate (28Grutter M.G. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2000; 10: 649-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar), were produced in a rabbit reticulocyte in vitro transcription/translation system and then digested with caspase-3. Catalytic efficiency (kcat/Km) was determined for both O-GlcNAcase and PARP and found to be 3.5 ± 0.7 × 103m−1s−1 and 5.0 ± 2.0 × 104m−1 s−1 respectively (data not shown and Ref. 43Casciola-Rosen L. Nicholson D.W. Chong T. Rowan K.R. Thornberry N.A. Miller D.K. Rosen A. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 183: 1957-1964Crossref PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar). We then tested the effect of caspase-3-dependent proteolysis on the activity of recombinant O-GlcNAcase. Remarkably, nearly complete cleavage of the recombinant O-GlcNAcase into roughly two equal halves had no effect on the in vitro activity ofO-GlcNAcase (Fig. 6B). Compared with phosphorylation, the role of O-GlcNAc is poorly understood. To investigate this modification, we and others have begun to characterize the enzymes responsible for the attachment and removal of this glycan (13Kreppel L.K. Hart G.W. J. Biol.

Biophys. 1999; 362: 38-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). In this study, we have focused on the recently cloned O-GlcNAcase (15Gao Y. Wells L. Comer F.I. Parker G.J. Hart G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 9838-9845Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar). All indications are that this enzyme is responsible for the previously described Hex C activity in higher eukaryotes (17Overdijk B. VanderKroef W.M. VanSteijn G.J. Lisman J.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1981; 659: 255-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The existing data that support this conclusion and show the differences with the classical hexosaminidases demonstrate that O-GlcNAcase and Hex C: (a) have been found to be in the cytosol, not the lysosome, (b) have a near neutral, not acidic, pH optimum, (c) do not bind to concanavalin A, and (d) are β-N-acetylglucosaminidases, not general hexosaminidases (15Gao Y.

Chem. 1994; 269: 19321-19330Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To facilitate our studies of this enzyme, we overexpressed the enzyme as a fusion protein with thioredoxin and epitope tags in an E. coli expression system (Fig. 1A). To facilitate characterization, we also generated a polyclonal antibody to a C-terminal peptide of O-GlcNAcase that recognized both recombinant as well as endogenous O-GlcNAcase (Figs.1B and 4A). Using a small syntheticO-GlcNAc-modified peptide as substrate, the recombinant enzyme appeared to be fully active as compared with purifiedO-GlcNAcase (Fig. 1C). Meese and colleagues (31Heckel D. Comtesse N. Brass N. Blin N. Zang K.D. Meese E. Hum. Mol. Gen. 1998; 7: 1859-1872Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), who originally identified theO-GlcNAcase primary sequence as an autoantigen in meningioma and as a putative hyaluronidase, also identified a splice variant ofO-GlcNAcase of 75 kDa, which results in a protein lacking the C-terminal one-third of the full-length protein (32Comtesse N. Maldener E. Meese E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Comm. 2001; 283: 634-640Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). We cloned this splice variant into epitope-tagged expression vectors and overexpressed it in both E. coli and COS-7 cells. In both cases, we were unable to detect any enzymatic activity in this variant (data not shown). This finding implicates the necessity of the C terminus for O-GlcNAcase activity. It is not clear what function this splice variant serves in a cellular context but many testable hypotheses can be generated, including competition with full-length active O-GlcNAcase for regulatory factors. To investigate whether or not O-GlcNAcase functions as a multimer like Hex A and Hex B, we performed size exclusion chromatography on the enzyme (Fig. 2A). We found that the recombinant enzyme migrated with an apparent molecular mass of 140 kDa, indicating that it is a monomer. In contrast, theO-GlcNAcase purified from cow brain migrated in a complex with several other proteins at a molecular mass of 600 kDa (Fig. 2). Our original cloning study had identified most of these proteins copurifiying with O-GlcNAcase (15Gao Y. Wells L. Comer F.I. Parker G.J. Hart G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 9838-9845Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar). Here, we were able to show that two of these previously identified proteins, TIP120 and cullin, are, in fact, not in a complex with O-GlcNAcase. The proteins that do appear to be associated with O-GlcNAcase include heat shock proteins (HSP110 and HSC70) and intracellular signal transducers (amphiphysin, DRP-2, and calcineurin). It is interesting to note that deregulation of amphiphysin, DRP-2, and calcineurin have all been associated with neurological diseases (33Antoine J.C. Absi L. Honnorat J. Boulestaix J.M. deBrouker T.

Also, severalO-GlcNAc-modified proteins, including neurofilaments, tau, and the β-amyloid protein, are implicated in neurological disorders (36Arnold C.S. Johnson G.V. Cole R.N. Dong D.L. Lee M.

Biochimie (Paris). 2001; 83: 583-590Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the gene for O-GlcNAcase maps to chromosomal location 10q24, which has been implicated in Alzheimer's disease and other neurological disorders (38Myers A. Holmans P. Marshall H. Kwon J.

It remains to be determined what proteins directly interact with O-GlcNAcase, what effect they have on the enzyme, and what, if any, roleO-GlcNAcase or O-GlcNAc play in neurodegenerative disease. As a first step toward understanding the mechanism ofO-GlcNAcase, we determined the kinetic parameters of the enzyme. To compare our results to other hexosaminidases, and because of the sensitivity of the Elson-Morgan method, we chose to use PNP-GlcNAc as the substrate. The recombinant human enzyme displayed classical Michaelis-Menten kinetics and had a Km of 1.1 mm and a Kcat of 1.1 s−1 (Fig. 3). This is in good agreement with studies that have measured the kinetics of enriched fractions ofO-GlcNAcase (from rat spleen, Km = 2.5 mm for PNP-GlcNAc, Ref. 25Dong D.L. Hart G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19321-19330Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and Hex C (from bovine brain, 0.5 mm for MUG, Ref. 17Overdijk B. VanderKroef W.M. VanSteijn G.J. Lisman J.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1981; 659: 255-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). In addition, theKm measured for O-GlcNAcase (1.1 mm) is similar to those calculated for Hex A (Km = 1.7 mm, transfected human neuroglial cells using MUGS as a substrate, Ref. 26Fernandes M.J.G.

Chem. 1997; 272: 814-820Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) and Hex B (Km = 0.7 mm, purified human from CHO cells using MUG as a substrate, Ref. 27Hou Y. Vocadlo D. Withers S. Mahuran D. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 6219-6227Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The turnover rate (1.1 s−1) calculated for O-GlcNAcase is in good agreement with that of Hex B (kcat = 0.7 s−1, Ref. 27Hou Y. Vocadlo D. Withers S. Mahuran D. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 6219-6227Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). To determine whether the cloned enzyme indeed is involved inO-GlcNAc cycling, we overexpressed O-GlcNAcase in mammalian cells. Overexpression of O-GlcNAcase in COS-7 cells resulted in a dramatic decrease in O-GlcNAc levels on endogenous proteins (Fig. 4). This method will serve as a valuable tool for future experiments to evaluate in vivo functions ofO-GlcNAc cycling. We and others have shown that inhibitors of O-GlcNAcase, such asO-(2-acetamido-2-deoxy-d-glucopyranosylidene)amino-N-phenylcarbamate (29Haltiwanger R.S. Grove K. Philipsberg G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3611-3617Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar, 41Dong D.L. Xu Z. Hart G.W. Cleveland D.W. J. Biol.

Physicians. 1998; 110: 422-432PubMed Google Scholar), are capable of elevating O-GlcNAc levels. We now have ways of directly raising and lowering O-GlcNAc levels in order to study the functional consequences of such procedures. Further, we have now shown that O-GlcNAcase can catalyze the hydrolysis of GlcNAc from a synthetic substrate (PNP-GlcNAc, Fig. 3 and Ref. 15Gao Y. Wells L. Comer F.I. Parker G.J. Hart G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 9838-9845Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar), from O-GlcNAc-modified synthetic peptides (Fig. 1 and Ref.15Gao Y. Wells L. Comer F.I. Parker G.J. Hart G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 9838-9845Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar), and from endogenous O-GlcNAc-modified proteins (Fig.4). Next, we examined the localization of endogenous O-GlcNAcase by indirect immunofluorescence and biochemical fractionation (Fig. 5). The majority of O-GlcNAcase is localized diffusely in the cytosol, whereas a small amount is in the nucleus where it is localized in a punctate pattern. This finding agrees with observations thatO-GlcNAc-modified proteins are more enriched in the nucleus than in the cytosol (44Comer F.I. Hart G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29179-29182Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). The reason for a condensed pattern in the nucleus is unclear at this time and under investigation. Finally, we wanted to determine what protease was responsible for the observed specific proteolytic fragment of O-GlcNAcase. This fragment of 65 kDa was seen in extracts of several cell lines (data not shown) and was also overexpressed when full-lengthO-GlcNAcase was transiently transfected into COS-7 cells (Fig. 4). An array of proteases was tested (data not shown) and caspase-3, an executioner caspase in apoptosis (45Wolf B.B. Green D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20049-20052Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (863) Google Scholar), was capable of efficiently cleaving the recombinant enzyme and producing a fragment of the appropriate molecular mass (Fig. 6). This resulting 65-kDa fragment represents the C-terminal portion of O-GlcNAcase, based on immunoblotting. At high concentrations of caspase-3, we also observed an immunoreactive fragment just below the uncleavedO-GlcNAcase, which may be the result of a second cleavage site. Suprisingly, caspase-3-dependent cleavage had no effect on in vitro assayed O-GlcNAcase activity (Fig. 6). Strikingly, calcineurin, which we showed to be in theO-GlcNAcase-containing complex (Fig. 2), is also a substrate for caspases, and its phosphatase activity is not reduced upon cleavage, rather the enzyme is no longer properly regulated (46Mukerjee N. McGinnis K.M. Gnegy M.E. Wang K.K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 285: 1192-1199Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). We examined the O-GlcNAcase primary sequence for the caspase-3 consensus motif DXXD (47Garcia-Calvo M. Peterson E.P. Leiting B. Ruel R. Nicholson D.W. Thornberry N.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17907-17911Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (844) Google Scholar). O-GlcNAcase has two such motifs, one (DDID) that would result in a predicted C-terminal fragment of 83 kDa and a second (DSED) that would result in a predicted C-terminal fragment of 63 kDa. The theoretical 63-kDa fragment is in close agreement with our observed 65-kDa cleavage product (Fig. 6). We are currently mapping the site of cleavage. Interestingly, several proteins that have been identified as substrates for caspases are autoantigens (48Rosen A. Casciola-Rosen L. J. Cell. Biochem. 1997; 64: 50-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Analogously, the O-GlcNAcase primary sequence was originally identified as a meningioma-expressed antigen (31Heckel D. Comtesse N. Brass N. Blin N. Zang K.D. Meese E. Hum. Mol. Gen. 1998; 7: 1859-1872Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). We are currently pursuing these exciting results and investigating the role of O-GlcNAcase cleavage andO-GlcNAc modification in apoptosis and autoimmunity. Overall, these studies have provided strong evidence that the clonedO-GlcNAcase is indeed an enzyme involved inO-GlcNAc cycling. Furthermore, the data suggest several potential modes for enzyme regulation, including subcellular localization, protein-protein associations, and proteolysis.

https://openalex.org/W2167388295,"Cisplatin is one of the most widely used agents in the treatment of solid tumors, but its clinical utility is limited by toxicity. The development of less toxic, liposomal formulations of cisplatin has been hampered by the low water solubility and low lipophilicity of cisplatin, resulting in very low encapsulation efficiencies. We describe a novel method allowing the efficient encapsulation of cisplatin in a lipid formulation; it is based on repeated freezing and thawing of a concentrated solution of cisplatin in the presence of negatively charged phospholipids. The method is unique in that it generates nanocapsules, which are small aggregates of cisplatin covered by a single lipid bilayer. The nanocapsules have an unprecedented drug-to-lipid ratio and an in vitro cytotoxicity up to 1000-fold higher than the free drug. Analysis of the mechanism of nanocapsule formation suggests that the method may be generalized to other drugs showing low water solubility and lipophilicity."

Two key translational regulators, p70 S6 kinase (p70S6K) and eukaryotic initiation factor 4E-binding protein (4E-BP1) lie downstream of (m)TOR in a cell signaling pathway responsive to AA supplementation (7Wang X.

The activation of p70S6K by phosphorylation enables it to phosphorylate its downstream target ribosomal protein S6 and increase translation of so-called 5′-terminal tract of pyrimidines mRNAs, which generally encode ribosomal proteins and elongation factors (2Shah O.J.

The activation of p70S6K is thought to lead to up-regulation of ribosome biosynthesis and thus increase the translational capacity of the cell. Phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 increases protein synthesis by releasing eukaryotic initiation factor 4E, which can then form the eukaryotic initiation factor 4F complex as a prerequisite for translation of the capped mRNAs (reviewed in Ref. 2Shah O.J.

Despite recent attention to the processes of nutrient-related signaling in animal cells (1van Sluijters D.A. Dubbelhuis P.F. Blommaart E.F. Meijer A.J. Biochem. J. 2000; 351: 545-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), a major unanswered question is how these nutrient stimuli are “sensed” by cells to initiate signaling. Does sensing of amino acids occur extracellularly, e.g. via a membrane bound receptor or amino acid transporter or intracellularly? This question has important implications for the way in which animal cells respond to changes in nutrient availability, because cytosolic and extracellular amino acid pools may be far from equilibrium. In an attempt to address these key questions, we have investigated AA sensing in the X. laevis oocyte. X. laevisoocytes are large single cells of up to 1 mm in diameter, which possess active translational and transcriptional machinery, and are suitable for microinjection of substances (e.g. of nutrients in solution) and overexpression of proteins (e.g. nutrient transporters). In comparison to typical mammalian cell culture systems, which are necessarily grown in nutrient-rich media making it more difficult to study AA-sensing mechanisms, stage VI oocytes can survive in nutrient-deprived media for several days if necessary and are arrested in meiotic prophase. Nevertheless, they receive a maternal nutrient supply in vivo and may be predicted to respond to nutrients including AAs in a manner similar to mammalian cells. Therefore, X. laevis oocytes represent a useful experimental system in which we could accurately manipulate intracellular as well as extracellular AA concentrations within physiologically relevant limits to study AA sensing mechanisms using p70S6K activity as a downstream reporter. The high sequence identity between X. laevis p70S6K and mammalian (rat) p70S6K(93%) plus conservation of all the phosphorylation sites and regulatory motifs present in the mammalian enzyme (15Schwab M.S.

These features of the Xenopus oocyte coupled with its relative impermeability to AAs (16Peter G.J. Davidson I.G. Ahmed A. McIlroy L. Forrester A.R. Taylor P.M. Biochem.

Unless otherwise specified, chemicals were obtained from Sigma. d-[3H]sucrose, [3H]tryptophan, [3H]glutamine, and [3H]phenylalanine were all purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Oocytes were isolated by collagenase treatment of ovarian tissue obtained from mature femaleX. laevis toads (South African Xenopus facility) using methods described previously (16Peter G.J. Davidson I.G. Ahmed A. McIlroy L. Forrester A.R. Taylor P.M. Biochem. J. 1996; 318: 915-922Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Defolliculated, stages V–VI (prophase-arrested) oocytes were selected and maintained at 18 °C in modified Barth's medium (MBM) containing (in mm) 88 NaCl, 1 KCl, 2.4 NaHCO3, 0.82 MgSO4·72O, 0.66 NaNO3, 0.75 CaCl2·2H2O, and 5.0 Hepes, pH 7.6 (adjusted with Tris base), and 10 mg/liter gentamycin sulfate. Solutions of specified composition (see Figs. Figure 1, Figure 2, Figure 3, Figure 4, Figure 5, Figure 6, Figure 7) were microinjected into the cytoplasm of individual oocytes (10–20 oocytes/condition).

In parallel, separate oocytes were injected with an identical volume of d-[3H]sucrose solution, and the retained injectate volume was calculated from measurement of oocyte radioactivity using methods described previously (16Peter G.J.

This volume was 27.4 ± 4.4 nl/oocyte (mean ± S.E., n = 9 separate typical experiments).

Open table in a new tab In experiments to determine effects of extracellular AAs, all oocyte incubations (10–20 oocytes/condition) were in MBM-based solutions at 18 °C for 30 min unless stated otherwise prior to cell lysis in extraction buffer as described above. In experiments in which the effects of rapamycin were investigated, cells were preincubated with 100 nm rapamycin (Calbiochem) in MBM for 15 min prior to oocyte microinjection or incubation. Rapamycin (100 nm) was also present during both post-injection and incubation periods. In certain experiments, oocytes were treated with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA, 1 μm) for 30 min to stimulate cell signaling pathways linked to phosphorylation of p70S6K. A 20× AA stock solution was prepared, which when diluted to 1× gave a composition that was comparable to the plasma concentrations found in X. laevis. Concentrations (1×) were (in μm) 38 Asp, 270 Thr, 243 Ser, 63 Asn, 667 Gln, 186 Pro, 76 Glu, 408 Gly, 471 Ala, 173 Val, 46 Met, 90 Ile, 161 Leu, 83 Tyr, 54 Phe, 418 Lys, 68 His, 132 Arg, 38 Cys, and 70 Trp (for review see Ref. 17Taylor P.M. Kaur S. Mackenzie B. Peter G.J. J. Exp. Biol. 1996; 199: 923-931PubMed Google Scholar and Table I). AA solutions (20×) used for intracellular microinjections were prepared in water, whereas extracellular incubation solutions (20, 5, and 1×) were prepared in MBM. Plasmids containing cDNA for the System L transporter subunits 4F2hc (kindly provided by Dr. L.C. Kuhn, Institute of Physiology, University of Zurich, Switzerland) and IU12 (kindly provided by Dr. Y-B Shi, NIH, Rockville, MD) were linearized prior to cRNA synthesis (mMessage mMachine, Ambion). Individual oocytes were co-injected with 4F2hc and IU12 cRNA (50 ng of each cRNA in 50 nl of injected cRNA/oocyte). Oocytes were incubated in MBM for 2–4 days to allow expression of injected cRNA before experimentation. AA transport in oocytes at 2–4 days post-injection was measured at 22 °C as influx of radiolabeled AA tracer. Experiments were carried out in MBM buffer, and uptake of3H-labeled Phe, Gln, or Trp was measured using a method described previously (19Peter G.J. Davies A. Watt P.W. Birrell J. Taylor P.M. Biochem. J. 1999; 343: 169-176Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Total oocyte lysates were centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 2 min, and the clear supernatant was retained (cleared lysate). The protein concentrations of cleared lysates were determined using the BCA method (Pierce). Proteins from cleared lysates (40 μg of protein/lane) were resolved by SDS-PAGE (20Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207856) Google Scholar) and transferred electrophoretically onto nitrocellulose membranes (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.) as described previously (21Hyde R. Christie G.R. Litherland G.J. Hajduch E. Taylor P.M. Hundal H.S. Biochem. J. 2001; 355: 563-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Membranes were probed using antibodies specific for p70S6K (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.), phosphorylated p70S6K (Thr-389, fromCell Signaling Technologies), phosphorylated p44/42 MAPK (Thr-202/Tyr-204, from Cell Signaling Technologies), and phosphorylated S6 ribosomal protein (Ser-235, kindly supplied by the Division of Signal Transduction Therapy, School of Life Sciences, University of Dundee) and were immunodetected by ECL (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.) using appropriate horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Diagnostics Scotland, Carluke, Lanarkshire, Scotland). Blots were quantified using a Bio-Rad GS-670 imaging densitometer. Microinjection of oocytes with 20× total AAs that raises intracellular AA concentrations by small but physiologically relevant amounts (see Table I), produced a mobility shift in p70S6K as detected by immunoblot analysis. This well characterized feature reflects phosphorylation of the p70S6K protein (Fig.1 A). This increase in p70S6K phosphorylation was an AA-specific event and not merely due to microinjection of cells or to osmotic effects of the injectate, because it was not observed in oocytes injected with either water or solutions of l-glucose at concentrations of up to 100 mm in the injectate (Fig. 1 A and Fig. 3). The intracellular AA-induced increase in p70S6Kphosphorylation was rapid, being detected within 20 min after injection (Fig. 1 B), and was sustained up to 3 h post-injection (Figs. 1, A and B). In contrast, the incubation of oocytes with excess extracellular total AAs (5× plasma concentration) for either 1 or 24 h resulted in no significant increase in phosphorylation of p70S6K, visualized by the lack of any significant mobility shift of p70S6K following immunoblot analysis (Fig. 1 C). Phosphorylation of p70S6K following microinjection of AAs was confirmed using a phospho-specific p70S6K antibody (Fig.2), and as an index of intracellular p70S6K activity, we studied the phosphorylation of its substrate S6 using an appropriate phospho-specific (Ser-235) antibody (Fig. 2). The phospho-specific p70S6K antibody we have used detects the phosphorylation of Thr-389, which has previously been demonstrated to be a rapamycin-sensitive/mTOR-dependent phosphorylation site (22Dennis P.B. Pullen N. Kozma S.C. Thomas G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6242-6251Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar, 23Weng Q.P. Kozlowski M. Belham C. Zhang A. Comb M.J. Avruch J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16621-16629Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). The incubation of oocytes with rapamycin prior to and following microinjection with AAs prevented the AA-induced mobility shift of the p70S6K protein. In line with this finding, rapamycin also prevented the AA-induced phosphorylation of p70S6K, detected using the phospho-specific antibody, and substantially reduced the concomitant phosphorylation of S6 (Fig. 2). Therefore, it appears that a direct increase in intracellular AA concentrations to ∼48% above that normally present within the oocyte (see Table I) results in a TOR-dependent increase in phosphorylation of p70S6K and that of its downstream target ribosomal protein S6, whereas exposure to relatively high concentrations of extracellular AAs (5× plasma levels) had no such effect on this pathway. The observation that the X. laevisoocyte is acutely sensitive to increases in internal but not external AA concentration suggests that this cell type possesses an intracellular AA sensor.Figure 3Effect of microinjection of AA, AA analogues, and l-glucose on phosphorylation of p70S6K inX. laevis oocytes. X. laevis oocytes were microinjected with solutions of indicated composition. Cell lysates were prepared 30 min post-injection and subjected to immunoblot analysis using an antibody specific for phosphorylated p70S6K (Thr-389). A, leucine (L-isomer and D-isomer) andl-leucinamide were all injected at 3.2 mm(equivalent to 20× Leu). B, all amino acids were injected at their respective 20× AA mix concentrations (3.2 mm Leu, 1.36 mm His, 3.72 mm Pro, 1.52 mm Glu in upper panel; 9.42 mmAla, 8.16 mm Gly, 13.34 mm Gln, 2.64 mm Arg, 8.36 mm Lys in lower panel.

Cell lysates were prepared 30 min post-injection and subjected to immunoblot analysis using antibodies specific for total p70S6K (top panel), phosphorylated p70S6K (Thr-389) (middle panel), or phosphorylated ribosomal protein S6 (Ser-235) (bottom panel). In top panel, upward bandshift (p70S6K (PP) shown byarrowheads) indicates phosphorylated forms of this protein.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Microinjection of l-Leu (20× plasma concentration) alone was sufficient to induce p70S6K phosphorylation and pathway activation over the same timescale (Fig. 2). l-Leucinamide was able to produce a similar effect to l-Leu, butd-Leu was ineffective (Fig.3 A). Certain otherl-AAs were able to significantly increase the phosphorylation of p70S6K when microinjected into X. laevis oocytes alone at 20× plasma concentration such as Trp (see below), Phe, Arg, Lys, and Gly but not Gln, Glu, Pro, or Ala (for example, see Fig. 3 B). As Leu by itself induced increased phosphorylation of p70S6K, we explored the dose dependence of these effects by microinjecting various concentrations of Leu (Fig.4). Relatively small increases in intracellular Leu concentration resulted in increased phosphorylation of p70S6K (e.g. injecting 1 mm Leu results in an ∼7% increase in intracellular Leu concentration and appears to induce nearly 50% maximal increase in p70S6Kphosphorylation, see Fig. 4 and Table I). The large size and low surface area/volume ratio of the X. laevis oocyte compared with mammalian cells in addition to a relatively low surface permeability to AAs means that intracellular AA concentrations rise relatively slowly as a result of any increase in extracellular AA concentrations (17Taylor P.M. Kaur S. Mackenzie B. Peter G.J. J. Exp. Biol. 1996; 199: 923-931PubMed Google Scholar). Overexpression of the System L AA transport system (24Christensen H.N. Physiol. Rev. 1990; 70: 43-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (965) Google Scholar) in the oocyte plasma membrane (25Ritchie J.W. Peter G.J. Shi Y.B. Taylor P.M. J. Endocrinol. 1999; 163: R5-R9Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) markedly increases surface permeability to many neutral AAs including Leu, Trp, and Phe, causing for example an 11× increase in [3H]Trp uptake (Fig.5 C) and a 16× increase in [3H]Phe uptake (results not shown) at 1× AA mix concentrations compared with control oocytes. For System L-overexpressing oocytes incubated in 1× AA mix, we estimate that this represents a potential to increase intraoocyte concentrations of AAs such as Phe by up to 75% after 30 min (values approaching those estimated for typical mammalian cells, for review see Ref. 26Taylor P.M. Rennie M.J. Low S.Y. Van Winkle L. Biomembrane Transport. Academic Press, San Diego, CA1999: 295-325Crossref Google Scholar). Thus, this possibility offers an opportunity to test further the idea that AA sensing is intracellular. When cells overexpressing System L were incubated for 30 min in either plasma AA mix (1 or 20×, Fig. 5,A and B) or 1× Leu (Fig. 5 D), there was now an increase in p70S6K phosphorylation that was not seen in similarly treated control cells or in System L-expressing cells incubated in MBM alone (Fig. 5, A and B). As observed for cells microinjected directly with AAs, this increase in p70S6K phosphorylation was also inhibited by rapamycin, again implicating TOR-dependent signaling in the AA-induced response (Fig. 5, A and D). Rapamycin (Fig.5 C) or Me2SO (vehicle for rapamycin stock, results not shown) had no significant effect upon Trp uptake by oocytes overexpressing System L. To confirm that the effects of overexpressed System L AA-dependent p70S6K phosphorylation were a response to cellular AA entry, oocytes were incubated with 1× plasma AAs plus 5 mm 2-amino-bicyclo[2,2,1]hepta-2-carboxylic acid (BCH), a specific inhibitor of System L-dependent transport (24Christensen H.N. Physiol. Rev. 1990; 70: 43-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (965) Google Scholar). 5 mm BCH almost completely inhibited the activity of overexpressed System L transport measured as uptake of [3H]Trp at physiological concentration (Fig.5 C). BCH abolished the ability of external AA to increase p70S6K phosphorylation (Fig. 5 B), presumably because it is blocking AA entry into the cells through System L (Fig.5 C) and preventing any subsequent sensing and signaling to TOR/p70S6K (Fig. 5 B). BCH microinjected into oocytes had no effect itself upon the phosphorylation of p70S6K (Fig.6 A). Yeast cells are believed to sense a decrease in intracellular AA concentration as a consequence of a decrease in tRNA charging (27Wek S.A. Zhu S. Wek R.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4497-4506Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 28Hinnebusch A.G. Microbiol. Rev. 1988; 52: 248-273Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 29Qiu H. Dong J. Hu C. Francklyn C.S. Hinnebusch A.G. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1425-1438Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). In this study, the injection of excess tRNA (460 ng/oocyte, type Y-SA from bakers' yeast in water) had no effect upon p70S6K phosphorylation (data not shown). To investigate further the possible involvement of tRNA aminoacylation in regulation of p70S6K, we microinjected three available AA alcohols (leucinol, tryptophanol, and alaninol) as competitive inhibitors of aminoacyl-tRNA charging by tRNA synthetases (30Vaughan M.H. Hansen B.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1973; 248: 7087-7096Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Surprisingly, increased intracellular concentrations of leucinol and tryptophanol resulted in increased phosphorylation of p70S6K, although their effects were less potent than those of the respective AAs (Fig.6 B). In contrast, alaninol like Ala itself was without effect (data not shown). As leucinamide proved an effective substitute for Leu as an activator of the p70S6K pathway in X. laevis oocytes (Fig.3 A), we also examined the effect of KIC, the natural aminotransferase product of Leu. Increasing the intracellular concentration of KIC by microinjection resulted in increased phosphorylation of p70S6K (Fig. 6 C). In an attempt to isolate any contribution of intracellular KIC-Leu interconversions to the observed response, the effects of microinjecting AOAA, an inhibitor of aminotransferases, were also investigated. Microinjection of AOAA alone (100 mm in injectate producing an estimated 3.6 mm final concentration in cytosol) had no effect on basal p70S6K phosphorylation, but it inhibited the stimulatory effects of co-injected KIC, Leu, or AA mix on p70S6K phosphorylation (Fig. 6 C). AOAA also unexpectedly blocked the stimulatory effects of injected leucinol and tryptophanol on p70S6K phosphorylation (Fig. 6,C and D). To exclude the possibility that AOAA was exerting a general toxic effect on oocytes, we demonstrated that the presence of AOAA had no effect on (a) activation of p70S6K by another stimulus (PMA, see Fig.7) or (b) activation of the p44/42 MAPK (Erk) pathway (Fig. 7). These results argue for a relatively specific effect of AOAA in our experiments and also show that Leu activation of p70S6K does not involve activation of the ERK pathway. Therefore, it is possible that the observed effects of AOAA result from it inhibiting the putative intracellular AA sensor rather than through inhibition of aminotransferases of which AA alcohols are not substrates to our knowledge. The data presented here show that the X. laevis oocyte is able to sense relatively small increases in intracellular AAs such as Leu, resulting in increased phosphorylation of both p70S6K and its physiological downstream target ribosomal protein S6. The activation of p70S6K is thought to up-regulate rapidly the translation of 5′-terminal tract of pyrimidines mRNAs encoding proteins involved in mRNA translation, thus increasing the overall capacity of the cell for protein synthesis in response to an increase in AA (substrate) availability. The ability of intracellular AA to activate p70S6K in oocytes is inhibited by rapamycin, indicating an important role for the TOR pathway in this response to AA as also reported for mammalian cells. In a number of mammalian cell types, (m)TOR has been demonstrated to play a pivotal role in AA-sensitive signaling responses, acting as a checkpoint for integration of detected changes in AA availability and signaling to proteins involved in regulation of mRNA translation such as 4E-BP1 and p70S6K (5Gingras A.C. Raught B. Sonenberg N. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 807-826Crossref PubMed Scopus (1193) Google Scholar, 6Rohde J. Heitman J. Cardenas M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 9583-9586Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). In X. laevis oocytes, it appears that intracellular rather than extracellular AA levels must increase to stimulate phosphorylation of p70S6K, implying the existence of an intracellular rather than extracellular AA-sensing mechanism. Oocytes became sensitive to elevated extracellular AA concentrations only when their surface permeability to AAs such as Leu was greatly increased by the overexpression of a System L transporter. It is the increased capacity to transport AAs into the cell via System L rather than the presence of the transporter protein itself that renders the cell more sensitive to extracellular AAs, because cells overexpressing the System L transport system incubated in MBM showed no detectable changes in p70S6K phosphorylation. Because of the low AA transport capacity in native X. laevis oocytes, extracellular AAs will enter the cell at a much slower rate than in cells overexpressing an AA transport system, or indeed cells in which AAs are microinjected directly into the cytoplasm. The increase in intracellular AA or Leu levels necessary to increase p70S6K phosphorylation in oocytes is relatively small, indicating that the sensing mechanism can detect small changes above basal values. Indeed, increasing intracellular Leu concentration by only ∼7% (Fig. 4) produces a detectable increase in the phosphorylation of p70S6K compared with uninjected cells or cells injected with water. Such increases in intracellular AA concentration are well within physiological limits. For example, in rats that have been fasted for 60 h, re-feeding with protein results in increases in muscle and liver Leu concentrations of 81 and 85%, respectively, within 1 h of the meal (26Taylor P.M. Rennie M.J. Low S.Y. Van Winkle L. Biomembrane Transport. Academic Press, San Diego, CA1999: 295-325Crossref Google Scholar). Our findings raise the question of the nature of the putative AA intracellular sensor(s). Are AAs detected directly by an AA “receptor,” or are indirect indices of AA concentration(e.g. transaminase activity, tRNA charging, see below) monitored by the systems triggering nutrient-sensitive signaling pathways? A transmembrane AA receptor (Ssy1p) has been characterized in yeast (31Forsberg H. Ljungdahl P.O. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 814-826Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar), but no structural homologue has been identified to date in higher organisms. In rat hepatocytes, however, Miotto et al. (32Miotto G. Venerando R. Marin O. Siliprandi N. Mortimore G.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25348-25353Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) have shown that the antigen peptide derivative Leu-8-multiple antigen peptide, which is not transported into hepatocytes, was as effective as Leu at suppressing macroautophagy and proteolysis. On this basis, they proposed site(s) on the plasma membrane that can generate intracellular signals in response to stimulation by extracellular Leu or Leu analogues (32Miotto G. Venerando R. Marin O. Siliprandi N. Mortimore G.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25348-25353Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). More recently, Conigrave et al. (33Conigrave A.D. Quinn S.J. Brown E.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 4814-4819Crossref PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar) have suggested that the functional properties of a Ca2+-receptor reveal a potential role as a sensor for AAs. However, the effects of Ca2+-receptor activation by AAs on downstream signaling targets (e.g. TOR, 4E-BP1, or p70S6K) have not been investigated (33Conigrave A.D. Quinn S.J. Brown E.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 4814-4819Crossref PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar). Ca2+-receptor was found to be more sensitive to aromatic AAs than branched chain AAs. Leu, for example, was found to be ineffective in activating this sensor. This observation contrasts with our results and those of others (7Wang X. Campbell L.E. Miller C.M. Proud C.G. Biochem. J. 1998; 334: 261-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar, 8Hara K. Yonezawa K. Weng Q.P. Kozlowski M.T. Belham C. Avruch J. J. Biol.

Our results are consistent with the presence of an intracellular mechanism that senses certain neutral and cationic AAs, also recognizing at least some of their respective AA alcohols, amides, and ketoacids, and activates the TOR pathway, resulting in downstream phosphorylation of p70S6K and S6. We were unable to exclude the possibility that the effects of the ketoacid KIC resulted from it being transaminated to Leu, because the transaminase inhibitor AOAA somehow appeared to inhibit the AA-sensing and/or signaling mechanism. This effect of AOAA was relatively specific to AAs and did not prevent the phorbol ester PMA from stimulating phosphorylation of p70S6K. We speculate that AOAA may act as a direct inhibitor of the AA sensor mechanism in oocytes, in line with previous work indicating that certain AA derivatives may block leucine-induced activation of p70S6K in H4IIE hepatoma cells (34Shigemitsu K. Tsujishita Y. Miyake H. Hidayat S. Tanaka N. Hara K. Yonezawa K. FEBS Lett. 1999; 447: 303-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The structural specificity of the sensor mechanism inXenopus oocytes appears broadly similar to that observed in mammalian cells (e.g. H4IIE hepatoma (34Shigemitsu K. Tsujishita Y. Miyake H. Hidayat S. Tanaka N. Hara K. Yonezawa K. FEBS Lett. 1999; 447: 303-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar)), favoring leucine over many other AAs and L-isomers over D-isomers, although it appears that the carboxylate group is not essential. Our data contrast with a previous study (9Iiboshi Y. Papst P.J. Kawasome H. Hosoi H. Abraham R.T. Houghton P.J. Terada N. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1092-1099Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar) where AA alcohols suppressed the activity of p70S6K in Jurkat cells. One possible explanation for this difference is that in the current study we are increasing intracellular AA alcohols directly by microinjection, whereas in previous studies, cells were incubated with high extracellular concentrations of AA alcohols (9Iiboshi Y.

Increased tRNA charging is most unlikely to be involved in the sensing mechanism because certain AA alcohols and leucinamide as well as AAs stimulated p70S6K. Other recent work (35Dennis P.B. Jaeschke A. Saitoh M. Fowler B. Kozma S.C. Thomas G. Science. 2001; 294: 1102-1105Crossref PubMed Scopus (813) Google Scholar) also indicates that AA pool size rather than the amount of aminoacylated tRNA is important for (m)TOR signaling, and furthermore it is reported (Jousse and Ron, quoted in (36Raught B. Gingras A-C Sonenberg N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 7037-7044Crossref PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar)) that the mammalian GCN2 kinase, which is believed to sense tRNA charging levels, is not required for nutrient-dependent activation of the (m)TOR pathway. The possibility that signaling is initiated in response to altered general AA metabolism, or resulting changes in cell energy status also seems very unlikely, because metabolically active AAs such as Ala or Gln were without any stimulatory effect. In conclusion, we present evidence that X. laevis oocytes possess an intracellular AA sensor that detects increased intracellular concentrations of AAs and modulates signaling through the TOR pathway. Using X. laevis oocytes, we have demonstrated that the selectivity of this putative intracellular sensor for AAs is similar to that observed in mammalian cells. Although overexpression of an AA transporter does not itself affect TOR signaling, this does allow extracellular AAs to stimulate p70S6K. The AA transporter thus acts as a conduit rather than a sensing or signaling element. The ability to detect and respond appropriately to small changes in AA availability well within physiological ranges should enable a cell to fine-tune the energy-expensive process of protein synthesis in relation to nutritional circumstances. Therefore, the X. laevisoocyte provides a useful model system for further investigating AA sensing and signaling pathways in vertebrate cells."

Here we show that Ser-73 is exclusively phosphorylated in vitro by p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase. In cells, Ser-73 phosphorylation occurs in association with p38 kinase activation and is inhibited by SB203580 but not by PD98059. Transfection of K8 Ser-73 → Ala or K8 Ser-73 → Asp with K18 generates normal-appearing filaments. In contrast, exposure to okadaic acid results in keratin filament destabilization in cells expressing wild-type or Ser-73 → Asp K8, whereas Ser-73 → Ala K8-expressing cells maintain relatively stable filaments. p38 kinase associates with K8/18 immunoprecipitates and binds selectively with K8 using an in vitro overlay assay. Given that K1 Leu-160 → Pro (157NQSLLQPL →157NQSPLQPL) leads to epidermolytic hyperkeratosis, we tested and showed that the analogous K8 Leu-71 → Pro leads to K8 hyperphosphorylation by p38 kinase in vitro and in transfected cells, likely due to Ser-70 neo-phosphorylation, in association with significant keratin filament collapse upon cell exposure to okadaic acid. Hence, K8 Ser-73 is a physiologic phosphorylation site for p38 kinase, and its phosphorylation plays an important role in keratin filament reorganization. The Ser-73 → Ala-associated filament reorganization defect is rescued by a Ser-73 → Asp mutation.

These mucosal keratins consist of a large family (at least 20 members termed K1 to K20) of cytoplasmic proteins that are divided into relatively acidic type I (K9 to K20, pI < 6) and relatively basic type II (K1 to K8, pI ≥ 6) keratins (1.Calnek D.

Epithelial cells generally express two or more keratin noncovalent heteropolymers in a 1:1 molar ratio of type I to II IFs, with an epithelial cell type-specific unique keratin complement. For example, single layered “simple type” epithelia express K8 and K18, with variable levels of K19 and K20 depending on the cell type, whereas keratinocytes express K5/14 or K1/10 basally and suprabasally, respectively. The prototype structure of all IF proteins, including keratins, consists of a central coiled-coil α-helix domain termed the “rod” that is flanked by non-α-helical N-terminal “head” and C-terminal “tail” domains (5.Herrmann H. Aebi U. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 79-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar, 6.Fuchs E. Weber K. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 345-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (1281) Google Scholar). Notably, the head and tail domains of keratins contain most of the structural heterogeneity among IF proteins and also include the domains that undergo phosphorylation. This distribution correlation and other accumulating data (7.Eriksson J.E. Opal P. Goldman R.D. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1992; 4: 99-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 8.Inagaki M.

Cell. 1992; 69: 899-902Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar), full appreciation of keratin and other IF protein function has been lagging. For some keratins, one clearly delineated function is to protect cells from mechanical and nonmechanical forms of injury, but how this occurs remains poorly understood (11.Coulombe P.A. Omary M.B. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2002; 14: 110-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (559) Google Scholar, 12.Omary M.B. Ku N.O. Hepatology. 1997; 25: 1043-1048Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 18.Marceau N.

Hepatology. 2002; 35: 251-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Regardless, an intact keratin filament network and how keratin filaments are organized appear to be important effectors of this ability to maintain cellular integrity. This is borne out by many in vitro studies that correlated the importance of various keratin domains to form typical-appearing filaments and by the phenotypes that have been observed in patients with keratin diseases and in animal models that express different keratin mutants (11.Coulombe P.A.

Although perturbations within the highly conserved proximal and distal ends of the rod domain (which harbor most of the described disease-causing keratin mutations but lack any evidence of phosphorylation (10.Omary M.B. Ku N.O. Liao J. Price D. Subcell. Biochem. 1998; 31: 105-140PubMed Google Scholar, 15.Irvine A.D. McLean W.H. Br. J. Dermatol. 1999; 140: 815-828Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar)) have significant effects on filament organization in vivo and in vitro, keratin phosphorylation within the head and tail domains also plays a significant role in filament organization in vitro (8.Inagaki M. Matsuoka Y. Tsujimura K. Ando S. Tokui T. Takahashi T. Inagaki N. Bioessays. 1996; 18: 481-487Crossref Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 21.Yano T. Tokui T. Nishi Y. Nishizawa K. Shibata M. Kikuchi K. Tsuiki S. Yamauchi T. Inagaki M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 197: 281-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) and in vivo (9.Ku N.O. Liao J. Chou C.F. Omary M.B. Cancer Metastasis Rev. 1996; 15: 429-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 10.Omary M.B. Ku N.O. Liao J. Price D. Subcell. Biochem. 1998; 31: 105-140PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, keratin mutations within the head domains, which may modulate keratin phosphorylation, have been described. For example, mutations have been described that either introduce a new potential phosphorylation site (e.g.K1 157NQSLLQP →157NQSPLQP which renders Ser-159 a potential proline-directed kinase phosphorylation site (22.Chipev C.C. Korge B.P. Markova N. Bale S.J. DiGiovanna J.J. Compton J.G. Steinert P.M. Cell. 1992; 70: 821-828Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar)) or remove possible phosphorylation sites (e.g. Ref. 23.Muller F.B. Kuster W. Bruckner-Tuderman L. Korge B.P. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1998; 111: 900-902Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Keratin phosphorylation has been most extensively studied in K8/18/19 (10.Omary M.B. Ku N.O. Liao J. Price D. Subcell. Biochem. 1998; 31: 105-140PubMed Google Scholar), due in part to the relative solubility of these keratins as compared with epidermal keratins (24.Chou C.F. Riopel C.L. Rott L.S. Omary M.B. J. Cell Sci. 1993; 105: 433-444Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These studies resulted in the identification of several phosphorylation-mediated K8/18 functions. For example, K18 Ser-33 phosphorylation regulates keratin binding to the 14-3-3 family of proteins during mitosis, which in turn plays a role in keratin filament organization and solubility (25.Liao J. Omary M.B. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 345-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar, 26.Ku N.O. Liao J. Omary M.B. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1892-1906Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). A direct role for keratin phosphorylation may also occur, as noted for K19, whereby mutation of its major phosphorylation site (Ser-35 → Ala) altered keratin filament organization in transiently transfected cells (27.Zhou X. Liao J. Hu L. Feng L. Omary M.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12861-12866Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). In addition, transgenic mouse studies showed that K18 Ser-52 phosphorylation facilitates a protective role against hepatotoxic injury (28.Ku N.O. Michie S.A. Soetikno R.M. Resurreccion E.Z. Broome R.L. Omary M.B. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 2023-2032Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), a finding that has provided direct evidence for a number of correlative data that document increased keratin phosphorylation in association with a variety of stresses in cultured cells and in intact animals (29.Ku N.O. Zhou X. Toivola D.M. Omary M.B. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: G1108-G1137PubMed Google Scholar). In the case of human K8, three major in vivophosphorylation sites have been identified: Ser-23, Ser-431, and Ser-73. Ser-23 is a highly conserved site among all type II keratins, which suggests a common keratin function for this modification, whereas Ser-431 is a basally phosphorylated site that increases its phosphorylation specific activity during mitosis and upon exposure to epidermal growth factor in association with filament reorganization (30.Ku N.O. Omary M.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7556-7564Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). In contrast K8 Ser-73 phosphorylation behaves like an on/off switch in cultured cells and in tissues, with phosphorylation being “on” during mitosis, a variety of cell stresses including heat and drug exposure, and during apoptosis (31.Liao J. Ku N.O. Omary M.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17565-17573Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Although the function of K8 Ser-73 phosphorylation was unknown, our hypothesis prior to embarking on this study was that its phosphorylation is likely to be important due to its on/off property and its association with important cell processes. Here we show that the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) p38 (reviewed in Refs.32.Davis R.J. Cell. 2000; 103: 239-252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3641) Google Scholar, 33.Kyriakis J.M. Avruch J. Physiol.

FASEB J. 1995; 9: 726-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (3203) Google Scholar) is a physiologic kinase for K8 Ser-73 phosphorylation, and we demonstrate that K8 Ser-73 phosphorylation plays a significant role in keratin filament reorganization in response to the phosphatase inhibitor okadaic acid. Since K8 Ser-73 is proximal to a human disease mutation site in epidermal K1 (NQSLLQPL → NQSPLQPL, Ref. 22.Chipev C.C. Korge B.P. Markova N. Bale S.J. DiGiovanna J.J. Compton J.G. Steinert P.M. Cell. 1992; 70: 821-828Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar; with K8 Ser-73 being part of the motif68NQSLLSPL of K8), we generated the equivalent K1 mutation in K8 (i.e. NQSLLSPL → NQSPLSPL) and showed that it increased K8 phosphorylation, as compared with wild-type K8. This skin disease-causing mutation also resulted in significant keratin filament collapse in the presence of okadaic acid. Therefore, K8 Ser-73 phosphorylation plays an important role in modulating keratin filament reorganization. In addition, this is the first demonstration that human keratin disease-causing mutations can indeed result in keratin hyperphosphorylation and that such hyperphosphorylation can affect keratin filament organization, which in turn may contribute to disease pathogenesis. The antibodies (Ab) used are as follows: L2A1 mouse monoclonal antibody (mAb) that recognizes human K18 (24.Chou C.F. Riopel C.L. Rott L.S. Omary M.B. J. Cell Sci. 1993; 105: 433-444Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); mAb LJ4 that recognizes K8 Ser(P)-73 (31.Liao J. Ku N.O. Omary M.B. J. Biol.

EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1892-1906Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar); rabbit Ab 3055 that recognizes K18 Ser(P)-52 (36.Liao J. Lowthert L.A. Ku N.O. Fernandez R. Omary M.B. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 1291-1301Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar); mAb M20 (NeoMarkers; Freemont, CA) that recognizes K8; and anti-FLAG antibody (Sigma). Other reagents used are as follows: anisomycin (An); Empigen BB (Emp); p42 kinase; c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK); p38 kinase (Calbiochem-Novabiochem); methyl methanesulfonate (MMS) (Aldrich); PD98059, anti-p38, and anti-phospho-p38 antibodies (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA); SB203580 (kindly provided by Dr. John Lee, SmithKline Beecham Pharmaceuticals, King of Prussia, PA); orthophosphate (32PO4); and [γ-32P]ATP (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). HT-29 (human colon), BHK (hamster kidney), and NIH-3T3 (mouse fibroblast) cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA) and cultured as recommended by the supplier. To activate p38 kinase, cells were incubated with An (10 μg/ml, 0–20 h) or with MMS (0.1 or 1 mg/ml, 0–24 h). Cells were then solubilized with 2% SDS-containing sample buffer (37.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207139) Google Scholar) followed by shearing of the DNA with a 27-gauge needle and then boiling for 2 min to generate a total cell lysate. Alternatively, cells were processed for immunoprecipitation as described below. For the kinase inhibitors SB203580 (p38 kinase) and PD98059 (MAPK kinase), cells were preincubated with these compounds (20 and 100 μm, respectively) for 1 h and then treated with An for 2 h. Transiently transfected cells were grown on coverslips and fixed 3 days after transfection, using 100% methanol (−20 °C) for 3 min. Staining was done as described (26.Ku N.O. Liao J. Omary M.B. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1892-1906Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). For okadaic acid (OA) treatment, OA (1 μg/ml) was added to the transfected cells for 2 h before fixation and processing. Fluorescence was analyzed using a Bio-Rad MRC1024 confocal laser scanning and a Nikon TE300 inverted microscope. Cells co-transfected with WT K18 and one of the four K8 constructs (WT, S73A, S73D, or L71P) were scored, after treatment with OA, based on their filament organization as follows: (i) cells with residual filaments, (ii) cells with fine dots but without any residual filaments, and (iii) cells with large dots. The K8 mutants K8 Ser-73 → Ala (S73A), S73D, and L71P were generated using a TransformerTM mutagenesis kit (CLONTECH Laboratories Inc., Palo Alto, CA) as recommended by the supplier. Wild-type (WT) K8, WT K18, or mutant K8 cDNAs were subcloned into the pMRB101 mammalian expression vector under control of the hCMV promoter. The FLAG-tagged α-isoform of WT p38 or p38 AF (kinase-inactive form due to double mutation at the phosphorylation sites, T180A and Y182F; Ref. 38.Han J. Lee J.D. Bibbs L. Ulevitch R.J. Science. 1994; 265: 808-811Crossref PubMed Scopus (2412) Google Scholar) were used to overexpress the p38 proteins in BHK cells with keratin constructs. Transient transfections into NIH-3T3 or BHK cells were done using LipofectAMINE as recommended by the supplier. The NIH-3T3 cells were used for immunofluorescence experiments because they provided a well formed keratin filament-staining pattern, whereas BHK cells were used to generate keratins for the biochemical experiments since they had a higher transfection efficiency. Immunoprecipitation was carried out by solubilizing cells with 1% Emp (1 h, 4 °C) in buffer A (phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) (pH 7.4) containing 5 mmEDTA, 0.1 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, 10 μm pepstatin, 10 μm leupeptin, 25 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1 μg/ml OA) or by solubilizing cells with 1% Nonidet P-40 in buffer A. After pelleting (15 min; 16,000 ×g), keratins were immunoprecipitated from the supernatant using Sepharose-conjugated L2A1 followed by washing, analysis by SDS-PAGE (37.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207139) Google Scholar), and then staining with Coomassie Blue. For immunoblotting, gels were transferred to membranes followed by blotting (39.Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44912) Google Scholar) with individual anti-keratin antibodies. Bound antibodies were visualized with peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies and enhanced chemiluminescence. Two-dimensional chymotryptic phosphopeptide mapping was carried out exactly as described (30.Ku N.O. Omary M.B. J. Biol.

The overlay assay was performed as described (41.Liao J. Lowthert L.A. Ghori N. Omary M.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 915-922Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Briefly, total lysate and K8/18 immunoprecipitates from HT-29 cells were analyzed using SDS-PAGE followed by transfer to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (4 °C). The membrane was blocked with 3% BSA in PBS for 2 days, followed by incubation with 1 μg/ml p38 kinase in PBS with 0.05% Tween and 0.1% BSA for 2 h (22 °C). After washing, the membrane was incubated with anti-p38 antibody for immunoblotting. In vitro kinase reactions were carried out using K8/18 immunoprecipitates. For each of the kinases used (p38, p42, and Jun kinases), the buffers provided by the supplier were used as recommended. Immunoprecipitates of K8/18 were washed two times with the respective kinase buffer (in addition to the routine washings as part of immunoprecipitation) and then incubated with 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP, the kinase, and 20 μm ATP (10 min in a total volume of 25 μl). The kinase reaction was quenched by adding 4 times the normal concentration of Laemmli sample buffer, followed by boiling for 90 s and then analysis by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. Metabolic labeling with [32P]orthophosphate was done by incubating cells (in 100-mm dishes) with 5 ml of phosphate-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% dialyzed fetal calf serum and 100 mm glutamine for 30 min followed by the addition of 50 μl of normal medium and 250 μCi/ml [32P]orthophosphate. After labeling for 5 h, keratins were immunoprecipitated from the detergent-solubilized cells using mAb L2A1 and then analyzed by preparative SDS-PAGE and Coomassie staining, followed by isolation of the individual keratin-stained bands for peptide mapping. We identified previously (31.Liao J. Ku N.O. Omary M.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17565-17573Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) K8 Ser-73 as a K8 phosphorylation site using what we termed a “reverse immunologic” approach. This was aided by an antibody termed LJ4, which was generated by immunizing mice with keratins that were purified from okadaic acid-treated HT-29 cells. As shown previously (31.Liao J. Ku N.O. Omary M.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17565-17573Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) and exemplified in Fig. 1A, mAb LJ4 selectively recognizes the hyperphosphorylated and slightly slower migrating K8 species termed HK8. The HK8 species are present in very small amounts in exponentially growing HT-29 cells as determined by immunoprecipitation with mAb L2A1, which recognizes the entire keratin pool (31.Liao J. Ku N.O. Omary M.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17565-17573Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), but become markedly enriched after immunoprecipitation with mAb LJ4. The LJ4 Ab recognizes HK8 exclusively (Fig. 1B, lane 1), and its reactivity is abolished if Ser-73 is mutated to an alanine (S73A) (Fig. 1B, lane 2). However, LJ4 does recognize K8 S73D weakly (Fig. 1B, lane 3), which migrates slightly faster than HK8 and a bit slower than K8, such that LJ4 has almost equal binding intensity to the barely visible Coomassie-stained HK8 as compared with the strongly staining K8 S73D species (Fig. 1B). We compared the in vitro phosphorylation of K8 by the proline-directed MAPKs p38 and p42, given the sequence context of K8 Ser-73 (71LLSPL) and the previous observation (31.Liao J. Ku N.O. Omary M.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17565-17573Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) that K8 Ser-73 becomes phosphorylated during heat stress and apoptosis. As shown in Fig. 1C, p38 kinase generates the radiolabeled HK8 species exclusively (a signature of Ser-73 phosphorylation), whereas p42 kinase generates phosphorylated K8 and HK8 (K8 > HK8; compare lanes 2 and 3). Mutation of the two major K8 phosphorylation sites, Ser-23 and Ser-431 (30.Ku N.O. Omary M.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7556-7564Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), did not affect formation of HK8 upon in vitro phosphorylation of K8/18 precipitates with p38 kinase (Fig. 2A, lanes 2 and 4). In contrast, mutation of K8 Ser-73 abolished formation of the HK8 species and resulted in barely detectable K8 phosphorylation (Fig. 2A, lane 3) that is likely due to Ser-431 phosphorylation (the only other K8 potential proline-directed kinase site, with the sequence 429LTSPG). The specificity of p38 kinase toward K8 Ser-73 is evident by the minimal formation of HK8 by p42 kinase (Fig. 2B) and the nearly equal generation of phospho-K8 and HK8 species by JNK (Fig. 2C). K8 Ser-23, which is a major basally phosphorylated K8 site (30.Ku N.O. Omary M.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7556-7564Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), is not phosphorylated in vitro by any of the three tested MAPKs, whereas K8 Ser-431 phosphorylation occurs by p42 and JNK but not by p38 kinase (Fig. 2). Hence, the in vitro kinase assays of WT and mutant K8 immunoprecipitates indicate that both JNK and p42 phosphorylate K8 Ser-431 and Ser-73 relatively promiscuously, albeit to varied levels, in marked contrast to the selectivity of p38 kinase to the K8 Ser-73 site. In addition, phosphorylation of K8 Ser-73 does not appear to impact on K8 Ser-431 phosphorylation and vice versa. Given the findings in Figs. 1 and 2, we explored the role of p38 kinase as a potential in vivo K8 kinase by utilizing known specific activators and inhibitors of p38 kinase and by comparing phosphopeptide maps of in vivo versus in vitro p38-phosphorylated K8. As shown in Fig. 3A, activation of p38 kinase in cultured HT-29 cells by An (42.Cano E. Doza Y.N. Ben-Levy R. Cohen P. Mahadevan L.C. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 805-812PubMed Google Scholar), as determined by p38 phosphorylation, is associated with rapid K8 Ser-73 phosphorylation. Similarly, the alkylating agent MMS, a known p38 kinase and JNK activator (43.Wilhelm D. Bender K. Knebel A. Angel P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4792-4800Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar), generates the HK8 species in a dose- and time-dependent fashion (Fig. 3B). Inhibition of An-induced p38 kinase activation with the specific inhibitor compound SB203580 abrogated K8 Ser-73 phosphorylation (Fig. 3C). In contrast, inhibition of ERK1/2 kinase activation with compound PD98059 did not significantly affect K8 Ser-73 phosphorylation but did inhibit K8 Ser-431 phosphorylation as determined by blotting with mAb 5B3 (Fig. 3D). A comparison of the chymotryptic phosphopeptide maps of K8 and HK8 that are isolated from in vivo phosphorylated cells shows that HK8 differs from K8 by the presence of peptides 2–5 and by the absence of the peptide highlighted by an unnumbered arrow (Fig. 4, a and b). Interestingly, the phosphopeptide profile of HK8 that is generated by in vitro phosphorylation of K8 with p38 kinase shows five major peptides (Fig. 4c) that co-migrate with peptides 1–5 that are isolated from in vivo labeled HK8. This is confirmed by mixing in vitro and in vivo labeled K8 (Fig. 4d) and by mixing in vivo labeled HK8 with p38-labeled K8 (not shown). The five peptides are generated by incomplete chymotryptic digestion (not shown). Taken together, these results suggest that a p38-like kinase is likely to be involved, in vivo, in K8 phosphorylation at Ser-73. We further substantiated in vivo p38 phosphorylation of K8 Ser-73 by comparing K8 Ser-73 phosphorylation in BHK cells transfected with FLAG-tagged human WT p38 or kinase-inactive p38 AF (Fig. 5A). The overexpressed p38α proteins are detected with anti-FLAG and anti-human p38 antibodies. As anticipated, p38 AF is not recognized by phospho-p38 antibody, and K8 Ser-73 phosphorylation increases in BHK cells that overexpress WT but not AF p38 (Fig. 5A, lanes 1–3). In addition, WT and AF p38 kinases co-immunoprecipitate with K8/18 in tr"

The amino acid sequence displayed 27% identity to that of human chondroitin synthase. The expression of a soluble form of the protein in COS-1 cells produced an active enzyme, which transferred β1,4-N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc) from UDP-[3H]GalNAc not only to a polymer chondroitin representing growing chondroitin chains (β-GalNAc transferase II activity) but also to GlcUAβ1–3Galβ1-O-C2H4NH-benzyloxycarbonyl, a synthetic substrate for β-GalNAc transferase I that transfers the first GalNAc to the core tetrasaccharide in the protein linkage region of chondroitin sulfate. Hence, the enzyme is involved in the biosynthetic initiation and elongation of chondroitin sulfate and is the key enzyme responsible for the selective chain assembly of chondroitin/dermatan sulfate on the linkage region tetrasaccharide common to various proteoglycans containing chondroitin/dermatan sulfate or heparin/heparan sulfate chains. The coding region of this enzyme was divided into seven discrete exons and localized to chromosome 8. Northern blot analysis revealed that the chondroitin GalNAc transferase gene exhibited a ubiquitous but markedly differential expression in human tissues and that the expression pattern was similar to that of chondroitin synthase.

The GAG chains exhibit tissue-specific and developmentally regulated expression and have been implicated in the regulation and maintenance of cell proliferation, cytodifferentiation, and tissue morphogenesis (for reviews, see Refs. 1Kjellén L. Lindahl U. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1991; 60: 443-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (1671) Google Scholar, 2Salmivirta M. Lidholt K. Lindahl U.

Recent studies of chondroitin/dermatan sulfate chains have indicated important roles in neural network formation in the developing mammalian brain, attracting much attention (for reviews, see Refs. 4Ohhira A. Matsui F. Tokita Y. Yamauchi S. Aono S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2000; 374: 24-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar and 5Sugahara K. Yamada S. Trends Glycosci. Glycotechnol. 2000; 12: 321-349Crossref Scopus (95) Google Scholar).Chondroitin/dermatan sulfate and heparin/heparan sulfate are produced on the so-called GAG-protein linkage region, GlcUAβ1–3Galβ1–3Galβ1–4Xylβ1-O-, attached to specific Ser residues of core proteins, which is common to the GAGs (for reviews, see Refs. 6Lindahl U. Rodén L. Gottschalk A. Glycoproteins. Elsevier, New York1972: 491-517Google Scholar and 7Rodén L. Lennarz W.J. The Biochemistry of Glycoproteins and Proteoglycans. Plenum Publishing, New York1980: 267-371Crossref Google Scholar). The synthesis of this region is initiated by the addition of Xyl to Ser followed by the addition of two Gal residues and is completed by the addition of GlcUA, with each reaction being catalyzed by the respective specific glycosyltransferase (6Lindahl U. Rodén L. Gottschalk A. Glycoproteins. Elsevier, New York1972: 491-517Google Scholar, 7Rodén L. Lennarz W.J. The Biochemistry of Glycoproteins and Proteoglycans. Plenum Publishing, New York1980: 267-371Crossref Google Scholar). The GAGs are built up on this linkage region tetrasaccharide by the alternate addition of N-acetylhexosamine and GlcUA residues. Chondroitin/dermatan sulfate is synthesized once GalNAc is transferred to the common linkage region, whereas heparin/heparan sulfate is formed if GlcNAc is added first. The first hexosamine transfer is therefore considered to be critical in determining whether chondroitin/dermatan sulfate or heparin/heparan sulfate chains are selectively assembled on the common linkage region. Although such mechanisms have long been proposed based on data from conventional structural and enzymological studies (7Rodén L. Lennarz W.J. The Biochemistry of Glycoproteins and Proteoglycans. Plenum Publishing, New York1980: 267-371Crossref Google Scholar), not all of the glycosyltransferases involved have been molecularly cloned. In particular, the molecular mechanisms underlying the biosynthetic selective chain assembly of different GAG chains have been a long-standing enigma, although the biosynthesis of heparin/heparan sulfate has recently been clarified by cDNA cloning of the responsible glycosyltransferases (for a review, see Ref. 8Sugahara K. Kitagawa H. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2000; 10: 518-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar).Recent cDNA cloning of the glycosyltransferases involved in the biosynthesis of heparin/heparan sulfate has revealed the biosynthesis to be associated with the EXT gene family, the hereditary multiple exostoses gene family of tumor suppressors (for a review, see Ref. 8Sugahara K. Kitagawa H. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2000; 10: 518-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). It has been demonstrated that human EXT1 and EXT2 are the heparan sulfate copolymerases that polymerize GlcUA and GlcNAc alternately (9Lind T. Tufaro F. McCormick C. Lindahl U. Lidholt K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26265-26268Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar, 10McCormick C. Duncan G. Goutsos K.T. Tufaro F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

EMBO Reports. 2000; 1: 282-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). The human EXTL1 protein is GlcNAc transferase II, which is involved in the chain elongation of heparan sulfate (12Kim B.-T. Kitagawa H. Tamura J. Saito T. Kusche-Gullberg M. Lindahl U. Sugahara K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 7176-7181Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar), the human EXTL2 protein is GlcNAc transferase I (13Kitagawa H. Shimakawa H. Sugahara K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13933-13937Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar), which determines and initiates the synthesis of heparan sulfate on the common GAG-protein linkage region (14Fritz T.A. Gabb M.M. Wei G. Esko J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28809-28814Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the human EXTL3 protein exhibits both GlcNAc transferase I and II activities (12Kim B.-T. Kitagawa H. Tamura J. Saito T. Kusche-Gullberg M. Lindahl U. Sugahara K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 7176-7181Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar).In contrast, the mechanisms of the chain assembly of chondroitin sulfate are not yet fully understood. We have recently cloned cDNA encoding a single large polypeptide, namely, chondroitin synthase, with the GlcUA transferase II (β1,3-glucuronyltransferase II) and GalNAc transferase II (GalNAcT-II) activities responsible for the biosynthesis of repeating disaccharide units of chondroitin sulfate (15Kitagawa H. Uyama T. Sugahara K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38721-38726Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). The feature of a single protein with dual glycosyltransferase activities is reminiscent of that of heparan sulfate copolymerases encoded by EXT1 and EXT2. However, characterization of the acceptor substrate specificity of the human recombinant chondroitin synthase revealed that the enzyme showed no GalNAcT-I activity, which determines and initiates the synthesis of chondroitin sulfate on the common GAG-protein linkage region (16Rohrmann K. Niemann R. Buddecke E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1985; 148: 463-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), indicating that at least one other gene encoding GalNAcT-I likely exists in the human genome. A data base search revealed two other human genes homologous to the chondroitin synthase gene. Here, we describe the identification of the gene product of one of the two genes in the novel gene family as the key enzyme (chondroitin GalNAcT) responsible for the selective chain assembly, i.e.initiation and elongation, in chondroitin/dermatan sulfate.DISCUSSIONWe have identified human chondroitin GalNAcT and demonstrated that the enzyme possessed both GalNAcT-I and -II activities responsible for chain initiation and elongation in chondroitin/dermatan sulfate. This enzyme is similar to a heparan sulfate GlcNAc transferase encoded by human EXTL3 or C. elegans rib-2, which has both GlcNAc transferase-I and -II activities responsible for chain initiation and elongation in heparin/heparan sulfate (12Kim B.-T. Kitagawa H. Tamura J. Saito T. Kusche-Gullberg M. Lindahl U. Sugahara K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 7176-7181Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 31Kitagawa H. Egusa N. Tamura J. Kusche-Gullberg M. Lindahl U. Sugahara K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 4834-4838Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Thus, in the synthesis of both chondroitin/dermatan sulfate and heparin/heparan sulfate, at least two kinds of enzymes, one for chain initiation and elongation (chondroitin GalNAcT and heparan sulfate GlcNAc transferase EXTL3, respectively) and the other for chain polymerization (chondroitin synthase and heparan sulfate copolymerases EXT1 and EXT2, respectively), are required. Intriguingly, these findings, taken together, suggest that although the chondroitin backbone is synthesized by the novel gene family proteins distinct from the EXT gene family proteins that assemble a heparan backbone, the assembly of the polysaccharide backbones of chondroitin sulfate and heparan sulfate shares a similar mechanism of chain construction.Until recently, little information was available about the role of GalNAcT-I in the assembly of chondroitin sulfate chains. It has been believed that GalNAcT-I exists in addition to GalNAcT-II, which synthesizes the repeating disaccharide region, since the pioneering work in 1985 of Rohrmann et al. (16Rohrmann K. Niemann R. Buddecke E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1985; 148: 463-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), who reported two distinct activities of β-GalNAc transferases I and II that are different in their thermostability. While GalNAcT-I was being studied, a unique α-GalNAc transferase, which shared similar thermostability with the previously reported GalNAcT-I (16Rohrmann K. Niemann R. Buddecke E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1985; 148: 463-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), was discovered in mammalian tissues and cells that transferred GalNAc from UDP-GalNAc to the linkage tetrasaccharide serine GlcUAβ1–3Galβ1–3Galβ1–4Xylβ1-O-Ser (20Kitagawa H.

Goto F. Ogawa T. Okabe H. Sugahara K. Glycobiology. 1999; 9: 703-967Crossref Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The amino acid sequencing of the enzyme purified from serum-free media of human sarcoma cells revealed it to be EXTL2 (13Kitagawa H. Shimakawa H. Sugahara K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13933-13937Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). To our surprise, the protein showed not only α-GalNAc transferase activity toward the linkage tetrasaccharide serine but also α-GlcNAc transferase activity toward GlcUAβ1–3Galβ1-naphthalenmethanol, which is an authentic acceptor for the previously reported GlcNAc transferase I (14Fritz T.A. Gabb M.M. Wei G. Esko J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28809-28814Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), indicating that EXTL2 is identical to GlcNAc transferase I, which selectively assembles a heparan sulfate chain in the common tetrasaccharide linkage region. Thus, the alleged GalNAcT-I, which is thermostable, appears to be identical to EXTL2 exhibiting GlcNAc transferase I activity for heparin/heparan sulfate chain assembly as well as α-GalNAc transferase, the physiological significance of which still remains to be established (13Kitagawa H. Shimakawa H. Sugahara K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13933-13937Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar).Genuine GalNAcT-I activity was detected for the first time in the spent medium of a human melanoma cell line when α-thrombomodulin was used as an acceptor substrate (24Nadanaka S. Kitagawa H. Goto F. Tamura J. Newmann K.W. Ogawa T. Sugahara K. Biochem. J. 1999; 340: 353-357PubMed Google Scholar). α-Thrombomodulin bears the truncated linkage region tetrasaccharide (GlcUAβ1–3Galβ1–3Galβ1–4Xylβ1-) (18Nadanaka S. Kitagawa H. Sugahara K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33728-33734Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) and accepted a β1,4-GalNAc residue at the reducing terminal, GlcUA, of the tetrasaccharide. The partially purified enzyme preparation also showed GalNAcT-II activity for chondroitin sulfate chain elongation. Interestingly, this activity was competitively inhibited by α-thrombomodulin, suggesting that both activities are catalyzed by a single GalNAcT (24Nadanaka S. Kitagawa H. Goto F. Tamura J. Newmann K.W. Ogawa T. Sugahara K. Biochem. J. 1999; 340: 353-357PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, both activities are greatly augmented by the α-thrombomodulin core protein, which appears to be recognized by the GalNAcT. In this context, the chondroitin GalNAcT identified in the present study also appears to recognize a specific peptide sequence in the core protein or an aglycone structure attached to the linkage region tetrasaccharide, as in the case of heparan sulfate GlcNAc transferases EXTL2 and EXTL3 (12Kim B.-T. Kitagawa H. Tamura J. Saito T. Kusche-Gullberg M. Lindahl U. Sugahara K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 7176-7181Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 13Kitagawa H. Shimakawa H. Sugahara K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13933-13937Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar), because the tetrasaccharide serine GlcUAβ1–3Galβ1–3Galβ1–4Xylβ1-O-Ser derived from the linkage region did not serve as an acceptor substrate (Table I). The aglycone of GlcUAβ1–3Galβ1-O-C2H4NHCbz probably mimicked the peptide sequence required, as observed for GlcNAc transferase I reactions catalyzed by EXTL2 and EXTL3, both of which also utilize GlcUAβ1–3Galβ1-O-C2H4NHCbz as acceptor (12Kim B.-T. Kitagawa H. Tamura J. Saito T. Kusche-Gullberg M. Lindahl U. Sugahara K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 7176-7181Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 13Kitagawa H. Shimakawa H. Sugahara K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13933-13937Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Thus, the chondroitin GalNAcT identified here seems to be similar or identical to the GalNAc transferase detected in the spent medium of a human melanoma cell line.As described previously (15Kitagawa H. Uyama T. Sugahara K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38721-38726Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar), a homologue of human chondroitin synthase is present in C. elegans as well as inDrosophila, consistent with the findings that chondroitin or chondroitin 4-sulfate is found in C. elegans andDrosophila, respectively (34Bulik D.A. Wei G. Toyoda H. Kinoshita-Toyoda A. Waldrip W.R. Esko J.D. Robbins P.W. Selleck S.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 10838-10843Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 35Yamada S.

Chem. 2000; 275: 2269-2275Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). Notably, however, a homologue of human chondroitin GalNAcT is absent in C. elegans but present in higher species such asDrosophila (data not shown). Based on these findings, we hypothesize that a single enzyme protein, chondroitin synthase, inC. elegans is responsible for all the transferase activities of GalNAcT-I and -II as well as β1,3-glucuronyltransferase II. It is likely that as in the biosynthesis of heparan sulfate (31Kitagawa H. Egusa N. Tamura J. Kusche-Gullberg M. Lindahl U. Sugahara K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 4834-4838Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), the biosynthetic mechanism for chondroitin sulfate in C. elegansis distinct from that in mammals. Characterization of chondroitin synthase in C. elegans is now in progress.The mechanism for the selective chain assembly of chondroitin/dermatan sulfate and heparin/heparan sulfate on the common linkage region tetrasaccharide has been an enigma since the discovery of the common linkage region tetrasaccharide in the mid-1960s (6Lindahl U. Rodén L. Gottschalk A. Glycoproteins. Elsevier, New York1972: 491-517Google Scholar, 7Rodén L. Lennarz W.J. The Biochemistry of Glycoproteins and Proteoglycans. Plenum Publishing, New York1980: 267-371Crossref Google Scholar). This was mainly because of a lack of cDNA cloning of the two key enzymes, GalNAcT-I and GlcNAc transferase I. As described here and previously (12Kim B.-T. Kitagawa H. Tamura J. Saito T. Kusche-Gullberg M. Lindahl U. Sugahara K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 7176-7181Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 13Kitagawa H. Shimakawa H. Sugahara K. J. Biol.

These cDNA probes will be useful for investigating the biological functions of chondroitin/dermatan sulfate as well as the mechanism of selective chain assembly of chondroitin/dermatan sulfate and heparin/heparan sulfate, both of which are ubiquitously expressed and play a variety of indispensable yet different biological roles in many tissues. Chondroitin/dermatan sulfate proteoglycans, consisting of a core protein with at least one covalently attached glycosaminoglycan (GAG)1 chain, are ubiquitous components of the extracellular matrix of connective tissues and are also found at the surface of many cell types and in intracellular secretory granules. The GAG chains exhibit tissue-specific and developmentally regulated expression and have been implicated in the regulation and maintenance of cell proliferation, cytodifferentiation, and tissue morphogenesis (for reviews, see Refs. 1Kjellén L. Lindahl U. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1991; 60: 443-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (1671) Google Scholar, 2Salmivirta M. Lidholt K. Lindahl U. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 1270-1279Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar, 3Perrimon N. Bernfield M. Nature. 2000; 404: 725-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (656) Google Scholar). Recent studies of chondroitin/dermatan sulfate chains have indicated important roles in neural network formation in the developing mammalian brain, attracting much attention (for reviews, see Refs. 4Ohhira A. Matsui F. Tokita Y. Yamauchi S. Aono S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2000; 374: 24-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar and 5Sugahara K. Yamada S. Trends Glycosci. Glycotechnol. 2000; 12: 321-349Crossref Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Chondroitin/dermatan sulfate and heparin/heparan sulfate are produced on the so-called GAG-protein linkage region, GlcUAβ1–3Galβ1–3Galβ1–4Xylβ1-O-, attached to specific Ser residues of core proteins, which is common to the GAGs (for reviews, see Refs. 6Lindahl U. Rodén L. Gottschalk A. Glycoproteins. Elsevier, New York1972: 491-517Google Scholar and 7Rodén L. Lennarz W.J. The Biochemistry of Glycoproteins and Proteoglycans. Plenum Publishing, New York1980: 267-371Crossref Google Scholar). The synthesis of this region is initiated by the addition of Xyl to Ser followed by the addition of two Gal residues and is completed by the addition of GlcUA, with each reaction being catalyzed by the respective specific glycosyltransferase (6Lindahl U. Rodén L. Gottschalk A. Glycoproteins. Elsevier, New York1972: 491-517Google Scholar, 7Rodén L. Lennarz W.J. The Biochemistry of Glycoproteins and Proteoglycans. Plenum Publishing, New York1980: 267-371Crossref Google Scholar). The GAGs are built up on this linkage region tetrasaccharide by the alternate addition of N-acetylhexosamine and GlcUA residues. Chondroitin/dermatan sulfate is synthesized once GalNAc is transferred to the common linkage region, whereas heparin/heparan sulfate is formed if GlcNAc is added first. The first hexosamine transfer is therefore considered to be critical in determining whether chondroitin/dermatan sulfate or heparin/heparan sulfate chains are selectively assembled on the common linkage region. Although such mechanisms have long been proposed based on data from conventional structural and enzymological studies (7Rodén L. Lennarz W.J. The Biochemistry of Glycoproteins and Proteoglycans. Plenum Publishing, New York1980: 267-371Crossref Google Scholar), not all of the glycosyltransferases involved have been molecularly cloned. In particular, the molecular mechanisms underlying the biosynthetic selective chain assembly of different GAG chains have been a long-standing enigma, although the biosynthesis of heparin/heparan sulfate has recently been clarified by cDNA cloning of the responsible glycosyltransferases (for a review, see Ref. 8Sugahara K. Kitagawa H. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2000; 10: 518-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). Recent cDNA cloning of the glycosyltransferases involved in the biosynthesis of heparin/heparan sulfate has revealed the biosynthesis to be associated with the EXT gene family, the hereditary multiple exostoses gene family of tumor suppressors (for a review, see Ref. 8Sugahara K. Kitagawa H. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2000; 10: 518-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). It has been demonstrated that human EXT1 and EXT2 are the heparan sulfate copolymerases that polymerize GlcUA and GlcNAc alternately (9Lind T. Tufaro F. McCormick C. Lindahl U. Lidholt K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26265-26268Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar, 10McCormick C. Duncan G. Goutsos K.T. Tufaro F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

EMBO Reports. 2000; 1: 282-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). The human EXTL1 protein is GlcNAc transferase II, which is involved in the chain elongation of heparan sulfate (12Kim B.-T. Kitagawa H. Tamura J. Saito T. Kusche-Gullberg M. Lindahl U. Sugahara K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 7176-7181Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar), the human EXTL2 protein is GlcNAc transferase I (13Kitagawa H. Shimakawa H. Sugahara K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13933-13937Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar), which determines and initiates the synthesis of heparan sulfate on the common GAG-protein linkage region (14Fritz T.A. Gabb M.M. Wei G. Esko J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28809-28814Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the human EXTL3 protein exhibits both GlcNAc transferase I and II activities (12Kim B.-T. Kitagawa H. Tamura J. Saito T. Kusche-Gullberg M. Lindahl U. Sugahara K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 7176-7181Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). In contrast, the mechanisms of the chain assembly of chondroitin sulfate are not yet fully understood. We have recently cloned cDNA encoding a single large polypeptide, namely, chondroitin synthase, with the GlcUA transferase II (β1,3-glucuronyltransferase II) and GalNAc transferase II (GalNAcT-II) activities responsible for the biosynthesis of repeating disaccharide units of chondroitin sulfate (15Kitagawa H. Uyama T. Sugahara K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38721-38726Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). The feature of a single protein with dual glycosyltransferase activities is reminiscent of that of heparan sulfate copolymerases encoded by EXT1 and EXT2. However, characterization of the acceptor substrate specificity of the human recombinant chondroitin synthase revealed that the enzyme showed no GalNAcT-I activity, which determines and initiates the synthesis of chondroitin sulfate on the common GAG-protein linkage region (16Rohrmann K. Niemann R. Buddecke E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1985; 148: 463-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), indicating that at least one other gene encoding GalNAcT-I likely exists in the human genome. A data base search revealed two other human genes homologous to the chondroitin synthase gene. Here, we describe the identification of the gene product of one of the two genes in the novel gene family as the key enzyme (chondroitin GalNAcT) responsible for the selective chain assembly, i.e.initiation and elongation, in chondroitin/dermatan sulfate. DISCUSSIONWe have identified human chondroitin GalNAcT and demonstrated that the enzyme possessed both GalNAcT-I and -II activities responsible for chain initiation and elongation in chondroitin/dermatan sulfate. This enzyme is similar to a heparan sulfate GlcNAc transferase encoded by human EXTL3 or C. elegans rib-2, which has both GlcNAc transferase-I and -II activities responsible for chain initiation and elongation in heparin/heparan sulfate (12Kim B.-T. Kitagawa H. Tamura J. Saito T. Kusche-Gullberg M. Lindahl U. Sugahara K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 7176-7181Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 31Kitagawa H. Egusa N. Tamura J. Kusche-Gullberg M. Lindahl U. Sugahara K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 4834-4838Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Thus, in the synthesis of both chondroitin/dermatan sulfate and heparin/heparan sulfate, at least two kinds of enzymes, one for chain initiation and elongation (chondroitin GalNAcT and heparan sulfate GlcNAc transferase EXTL3, respectively) and the other for chain polymerization (chondroitin synthase and heparan sulfate copolymerases EXT1 and EXT2, respectively), are required. Intriguingly, these findings, taken together, suggest that although the chondroitin backbone is synthesized by the novel gene family proteins distinct from the EXT gene family proteins that assemble a heparan backbone, the assembly of the polysaccharide backbones of chondroitin sulfate and heparan sulfate shares a similar mechanism of chain construction.Until recently, little information was available about the role of GalNAcT-I in the assembly of chondroitin sulfate chains. It has been believed that GalNAcT-I exists in addition to GalNAcT-II, which synthesizes the repeating disaccharide region, since the pioneering work in 1985 of Rohrmann et al. (16Rohrmann K. Niemann R. Buddecke E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1985; 148: 463-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), who reported two distinct activities of β-GalNAc transferases I and II that are different in their thermostability. While GalNAcT-I was being studied, a unique α-GalNAc transferase, which shared similar thermostability with the previously reported GalNAcT-I (16Rohrmann K. Niemann R. Buddecke E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1985; 148: 463-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), was discovered in mammalian tissues and cells that transferred GalNAc from UDP-GalNAc to the linkage tetrasaccharide serine GlcUAβ1–3Galβ1–3Galβ1–4Xylβ1-O-Ser (20Kitagawa H.

Fjelstad M. Lindahl U. Goto F. Ogawa T. Kitagawa H. Sugahara K. Glycoconj. J. 1997; 14: 737-742Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) through an α1,4-linkage (33Kitagawa H. Kano Y. Shimakawa H. Goto F. Ogawa T. Okabe H. Sugahara K. Glycobiology. 1999; 9: 703-967Crossref Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The amino acid sequencing of the enzyme purified from serum-free media of human sarcoma cells revealed it to be EXTL2 (13Kitagawa H. Shimakawa H. Sugahara K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13933-13937Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). To our surprise, the protein showed not only α-GalNAc transferase activity toward the linkage tetrasaccharide serine but also α-GlcNAc transferase activity toward GlcUAβ1–3Galβ1-naphthalenmethanol, which is an authentic acceptor for the previously reported GlcNAc transferase I (14Fritz T.A. Gabb M.M. Wei G. Esko J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28809-28814Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), indicating that EXTL2 is identical to GlcNAc transferase I, which selectively assembles a heparan sulfate chain in the common tetrasaccharide linkage region. Thus, the alleged GalNAcT-I, which is thermostable, appears to be identical to EXTL2 exhibiting GlcNAc transferase I activity for heparin/heparan sulfate chain assembly as well as α-GalNAc transferase, the physiological significance of which still remains to be established (13Kitagawa H. Shimakawa H. Sugahara K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13933-13937Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar).Genuine GalNAcT-I activity was detected for the first time in the spent medium of a human melanoma cell line when α-thrombomodulin was used as an acceptor substrate (24Nadanaka S. Kitagawa H. Goto F. Tamura J. Newmann K.W. Ogawa T. Sugahara K. Biochem. J. 1999; 340: 353-357PubMed Google Scholar). α-Thrombomodulin bears the truncated linkage region tetrasaccharide (GlcUAβ1–3Galβ1–3Galβ1–4Xylβ1-) (18Nadanaka S. Kitagawa H. Sugahara K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33728-33734Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) and accepted a β1,4-GalNAc residue at the reducing terminal, GlcUA, of the tetrasaccharide. The partially purified enzyme preparation also showed GalNAcT-II activity for chondroitin sulfate chain elongation. Interestingly, this activity was competitively inhibited by α-thrombomodulin, suggesting that both activities are catalyzed by a single GalNAcT (24Nadanaka S. Kitagawa H. Goto F. Tamura J. Newmann K.W. Ogawa T. Sugahara K. Biochem. J. 1999; 340: 353-357PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, both activities are greatly augmented by the α-thrombomodulin core protein, which appears to be recognized by the GalNAcT. In this context, the chondroitin GalNAcT identified in the present study also appears to recognize a specific peptide sequence in the core protein or an aglycone structure attached to the linkage region tetrasaccharide, as in the case of heparan sulfate GlcNAc transferases EXTL2 and EXTL3 (12Kim B.-T. Kitagawa H. Tamura J. Saito T. Kusche-Gullberg M. Lindahl U. Sugahara K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 7176-7181Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 13Kitagawa H. Shimakawa H. Sugahara K. J. Biol.

The aglycone of GlcUAβ1–3Galβ1-O-C2H4NHCbz probably mimicked the peptide sequence required, as observed for GlcNAc transferase I reactions catalyzed by EXTL2 and EXTL3, both of which also utilize GlcUAβ1–3Galβ1-O-C2H4NHCbz as acceptor (12Kim B.-T.

Sugahara K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13933-13937Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Thus, the chondroitin GalNAcT identified here seems to be similar or identical to the GalNAc transferase detected in the spent medium of a human melanoma cell line.As described previously (15Kitagawa H.

Chem. 2001; 276: 38721-38726Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar), a homologue of human chondroitin synthase is present in C. elegans as well as inDrosophila, consistent with the findings that chondroitin or chondroitin 4-sulfate is found in C. elegans andDrosophila, respectively (34Bulik D.A.

As described previously (15Kitagawa H. Uyama T. Sugahara K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38721-38726Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar), a homologue of human chondroitin synthase is present in C. elegans as well as inDrosophila, consistent with the findings that chondroitin or chondroitin 4-sulfate is found in C. elegans andDrosophila, respectively (34Bulik D.A. Wei G. Toyoda H. Kinoshita-Toyoda A. Waldrip W.R. Esko J.D. Robbins P.W. Selleck S.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 10838-10843Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 35Yamada S.

Notably, however, a homologue of human chondroitin GalNAcT is absent in C. elegans but present in higher species such asDrosophila (data not shown). Based on these findings, we hypothesize that a single enzyme protein, chondroitin synthase, inC. elegans is responsible for all the transferase activities of GalNAcT-I and -II as well as β1,3-glucuronyltransferase II. It is likely that as in the biosynthesis of heparan sulfate (31Kitagawa H. Egusa N. Tamura J. Kusche-Gullberg M. Lindahl U. Sugahara K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 4834-4838Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), the biosynthetic mechanism for chondroitin sulfate in C. elegansis distinct from that in mammals. Characterization of chondroitin synthase in C. elegans is now in progress. The mechanism for the selective chain assembly of chondroitin/dermatan sulfate and heparin/heparan sulfate on the common linkage region tetrasaccharide has been an enigma since the discovery of the common linkage region tetrasaccharide in the mid-1960s (6Lindahl U. Rodén L. Gottschalk A. Glycoproteins. Elsevier, New York1972: 491-517Google Scholar, 7Rodén L. Lennarz W.J. The Biochemistry of Glycoproteins and Proteoglycans. Plenum Publishing, New York1980: 267-371Crossref Google Scholar). This was mainly because of a lack of cDNA cloning of the two key enzymes, GalNAcT-I and GlcNAc transferase I. As described here and previously (12Kim B.-T. Kitagawa H. Tamura J. Saito T. Kusche-Gullberg M. Lindahl U. Sugahara K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

These cDNA probes will be useful for investigating the biological functions of chondroitin/dermatan sulfate as well as the mechanism of selective chain assembly of chondroitin/dermatan sulfate and heparin/heparan sulfate, both of which are ubiquitously expressed and play a variety of indispensable yet different biological roles in many tissues.

It inhibits tumor cell motility and angiogenesis, and although predominantly cytoplasmic, it is also localized to the cell surface. In this study we have investigated the use of the yeast two-hybrid interaction trap to identify novel maspin targets. A target human fibroblast cDNA library was screened, and the α-2 chain of type I collagen was identified as a potential interactant. Binding studies with isolated proteins showed interaction between recombinant maspin and types I and III collagen but not other collagen subtypes, a profile strikingly similar to mouse pigment epithelium-derived factor (caspin), which is similarly down-regulated in murine adenocarcinoma tumors and is a potent inhibitor of angiogenesis. Kinetic analysis using an IAsys resonant mirror biosensor determined the dissociation constant of maspin for collagen type I to be 0.63 μm. Further two-hybrid interactions with maspin truncation constructs suggest that collagen binding is localized to amino acids 84–112 of maspin, which aligns with the collagen-binding region of colligin. A direct interaction between exogenous or cell surface maspin and extracellular matrix collagen may contribute to a cell adhesion role in the prevention of tumor cell migration and angiogenesis.

A number of findings support its role as a tumor suppressor: levels of maspin expression show an inverse correlation with progression of breast cancer; mammary carcinoma cells transfected with maspin showed reduced tumor growth and metastasis in nude mice (1.Zou Z.

Pemberton P.A. Sager R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30988-30993Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); and more recently, maspin has been shown to inhibit angiogenesis by blocking in vitro migration of endothelial cells and by in vivoinhibition of rat cornea neovascularization (4.Zhang M. Volpert O Shi Y.H. Bouck N. Nat. Med. 2000; 6: 196-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar). mammary serine protease inhibitor recombinant serine proteases inhibitor plasminogen activator inhibitor types 1 and 2 pigment epithelium-derived factor urokinase-type plasminogen activator bovine serum albumin Maspin belongs to the serpin (serine proteasesinhibitor) superfamily of proteins and can be included in the ovalbumin subfamily, which appear to be mostly intracellular (5.Remold-O'Donnell E.

The maspin gene has been localized to chromosome 18q21.3 where it is clustered with PAI-2 and the squamous cell carcinoma antigens (7.Schneider S.S. Schick C. Fish K.E. Miller E. Pena J.C. Treter S.D. Hui S.M. Silverman G.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3147-3151Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). Initial studies suggested that maspin may be a non-inhibitory serpin (8.Pemberton P.A. Wong D.T. Gibson H.L. Kiefer M.C. Fitzpatrick P.A. Sager R. Barr P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15832-15837Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar), and although an unusual biphasic inhibitory and activatory effect with single chain tissue-type plasminogen activator has been reported (9.Sheng S. Truong B. Fredrickson D. Wu R. Pardee A.B. Sager R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 499-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar), this does not appear to be a target for maspin in mammary gland extracts (10.Zhang M. Magit D. Botteri F Shi H.Y. He K. Li M. Furth P. Sager R. Dev. Biol. 1999; 215: 278-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The predicted P1 residue of maspin is arginine, and trypsin cleavage of the reactive site loop demonstrated that the loop sequence was necessary for inhibition of cell invasion (3.Sheng S. Pemberton P.A. Sager R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30988-30993Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, inhibition of angiogenesis was found to be independent of reactive site loop integrity (4.Zhang M. Volpert O Shi Y.H. Bouck N. Nat. Med. 2000; 6: 196-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar). Tissue distribution studies have shown expression of maspin in other organs including placenta, prostate, and small intestine. Subcellular localization studies show maspin to be predominantly a soluble cytoplasmic protein (95%), but it is also associated with secretory vesicles and is present at the cell surface (11.Pemberton P.A. Tipton A.R. Pavloff N. Smith J. Erickson J.R. Mouchabeck Z.M. Kiefer M.C. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1997; 45: 1697-1706Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Functional studies suggest that this surface-bound maspin is responsible for inhibition of cell invasion (12.Sheng S. Carey J. Seftor E.A. Dias L. Hendrix M.J. Sager R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 11669-11674Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). The addition of rMaspin to MDA-MB-435 breast cancer cells was found to alter the integrin profile by inducing α5 and α3 integrins and down-regulating other integrins. This was accompanied by a decreased ability to migrate through a fibronectin matrix and may provide a mechanism whereby maspin can suppress the invasive phenotype of these cells (13.Seftor R.E.B. Seftor E.A. Sheng S. Pemberton P.A. Sager R. Hendrix M.J.C. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 5681-5685PubMed Google Scholar). More recently, studies of the human cornea suggest a role for maspin in regulation of stromal cell adhesion to the extracellular matrix. Late-passage stromal cells that had lost the ability to produce maspin responded to exogenous recombinant maspin as measured by increased cell adhesion to fibronectin, type I collagen, type IV collagen type 1, and laminin (14.Ngamkitidechakul C. Burke J.M. O'Brien W.J. Twining S.S. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2001; 42: 3135-3141PubMed Google Scholar). An increasing number of serpins have been found to bind ligands other than target proteases. Interaction with heparin resulting in enhanced serpin inhibitory activity has been well documented for antithrombin III and heparin cofactor II (15.Bourin M.C. Lindahl U. Biochem. J. 1993; 289: 313-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar). Inhibition of cell migration by PAI-1 is mediated by specific binding of vitronectin (16.De Declerck P.J. Mol M. Alessi M.C. Baudner S. Paques E.P. Preissner K.T. Muller-Berghaus G. Collen D. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 15454-15461Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which competes with vitronectin VNR αvβ3 receptor binding and blocks smooth muscle cell migration. This binding is independent of plasminogen activator inhibition, but formation of a complex with uPA decreases affinity for vitronectin and restores cell migration (17.Stefansson S. Lawrence D.A. Nature. 1996; 383: 441-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (607) Google Scholar). The dual localization of some partially secreted ovalbumin-type serpins such as PAI-2 and maspin suggests the possibility of more than one function or ligand. This is borne out in the case of PAI-2, which in addition to inhibiting uPA can protect cells against tumor necrosis factor-mediated apoptosis (18.Dickinson J.L. Bates E.J. Ferrante A. Antalis T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27894-27904Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar) and can also bind annexins via the C-D interhelical region (19.Jensen P.H. Jensen T.G. Laug W.E. Hager H. Gliemann J. Pepinsky B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26892-26899Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). In this report we have investigated the yeast two-hybrid LexA interaction trap (20.Gyuris J. Golemis E. Chertkov H. Brent R. Cell. 1993; 75: 791-803Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1327) Google Scholar) as a potential method for detecting novel serpin targets and have found an interaction between maspin and type I collagen. Verification with protein-protein interactions indicated that maspin preferentially binds collagen subtypes I and III. The similarity of this profile to that of the anti-angiogenic serpin, pigment epithelium-derived growth factor (PEDF) (21.Dawson D.W. Volpert O.V. Gillis P. Crawford S.E. Xu H-J. Benedict W. Bouck N.P. Science. 1999; 285: 245-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (1413) Google Scholar), the expression of which correlates inversely with metastatic potential in colon adenocarcinoma cells (22.Kozaki K.

Chem. 1998; 273: 15125-15130Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), suggests that collagen association may be a factor in serpin inhibition of angiogenesis. All components of the two-hybrid system including vectors pEG202 and pJG4–5, WI-38 fetal fibroblast cDNA “target” library in pJG4–5, Saccharomyces cerevisiaeEGY48, Escherichia coli strain KC8, and the polyclonal anti-LexA antibody were kindly donated by Luke O'Neill (Trinity College Dublin). E. coli strains XL-1 Blue and BL21(DE3) were obtained from Stratagene. The bacterial expression vector pRSETC was obtained from Invitrogen. Q-Sepharose, iminodiacetic acid (metal affinity matrix), collagen-agarose, collagen subtypes I, II, III, IV, and V, and horseradish peroxidase-linked goat anti-mouse IgM secondary antibody were purchased from Sigma. The IgM mouse monoclonal antibody to maspin was obtained from Transduction Laboratories. Immunoblots were developed by enhanced chemiluminescence (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). All oligonucleotide primers were obtained from Genosys (Cambridge, UK). Full-length human maspin cDNA was amplified by reverse transcription-PCR. Total RNA was isolated from HeLa cells using a phenol/guanidinium thiocyanate extraction method (23.Chomczynski P. BioTechniques. 1993; 15: 532-537PubMed Google Scholar), and first strand cDNA was synthesized from total RNA (1 μg) using Moloney murine leukemia virus-reverse transcriptase and random hexanucleotide primers. PCR amplification of first strand cDNA was performed with the following primer pair specific to the 5′ and 3′ ends of the maspin gene: primer A, 5′-GGGGAATTCATGGATGCCCTGCAACTA-3′ (sense oligonucleotide corresponding to nucleotides 1–18 of maspin coding sequence and incorporating an EcoRI restriction site) and primer B, 5′-AAAAGTCGACTGCCACTTAAGGAGAA-3′ (antisense oligonucleotide corresponding to nucleotides 1119–1128 of maspin coding sequence plus nucleotides 1–6 of the 3′ untranslated sequence and incorporating a SalI restriction site). Amplification was carried out with 1.5 mm MgCl2 for 35 cycles of 94 °C × 1 min, 45 °C × 1 min, and 72 °C × 2 min. The product was cloned into the yeast two-hybrid bait vector pEG202 using EcoRI and SalI restriction sites and propagated in E. coli XL-1 Blue cells. Dideoxy sequencing was performed to verify correct in-frame insertion. Yeast (S. cerevisiae EGY48) was transformed with the pEG202 plasmid containing maspin using a lithium acetate protocol (24.Schiestl R.H. Gietz R.D. Curr. Genet. 1989; 16: 339-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (1781) Google Scholar). Following overnight growth of transformants at 30 °C in complete minimal medium with supplemented amino acids, fresh cultures were inoculated at A600 of 0.15 and grown in enriched media YEPD (1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, and 2% dextrose) to an A600 of 0.6–1.0. Yeast total protein extract was prepared, and the expression of the maspin-LexA fusion protein was examined by immunoblotting using a mouse polyclonal antibody to LexA (1:1500) and a peroxidase-linked goat anti-mouse secondary antibody (1:2000). Maspin fused to the LexA-binding domain was used as a bait to screen a human fibroblast cell cDNA library fused to the activation domain of LexA. The bait-containing vector pEG202 and the library-containing target vector pJG4–5 were sequentially transformed into the two-hybrid yeast strain EGY48 and grown on medium lacking leucine to select for potential interactors. Approximately 2 × 106 clones representing one-third of the library equivalent were screened against the maspin bait. Transformants with the ability to grow on leucine-deficient media were subsequently screened for β-galactosidase reporter gene expression. Yeast colonies passing the dual selection screen were carried forward as potential interactor clones. Unique clones within this pool were detected by PCR amplification of the target inserts using the following primers to the vector arms of pJG4–5: (primer C, 5′-CCAGCCTCTTGCTGAGTGGAGATG-3′, and primer D, 5′-GACAAGCCGACAACCTTGATTGGAG-3′). Dideoxy sequencing was performed on products of unique insert size and/or restriction pattern to identify the target maspin interacting protein in each case. Plasmid DNA was prepared from the clone(s) of interest and transformed into E. coli KC8, a bacterial strain that is auxotrophic for tryptophan and therefore selectively propagates pJG4–5. Interaction studies of target and bait vectors against nonrecombinant pEG202 and pJG4–5 were conducted to eliminate false positives, which have an activator function (β-galactosidase activity) in the absence of an interacting partner. Full-length maspin cDNA was amplified by PCR from recombinant pEG202/maspin (described above) using the following primer pair: primer E, 5′-GGGGAATTCAATGGATGCCCTGCAAC-3′ (sense oligonucleotide containing nucleotides 1–16 of maspin coding sequence and incorporating an EcoRI restriction site), and primer F, 5′-AAAAAGCTTTTAAGGAGAACAGAATT-3′ (antisense oligonucleotide containing nucleotides 1112–1128 of maspin coding sequence and incorporating a HindIII restriction site). The PCR was carried out with 1.5 mm MgCl2 for 30 cycles of 94 °C × 1 min, 48 °C × 1 min, and 72 °C × 2 min. The amplified product was subsequently cloned into the expression vector pRSETC at the EcoRI and HindIII restriction sites. Recombinant maspin was overexpressed from pRSETC (Invitrogen) in E. coli. BL21(DE3), producing a recombinant fusion protein with a polyhistidine metal-binding tail at the N terminus. Cells grown to an A600 = 0.6 were induced with 1 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside and grown for another 5 h. Following harvesting by centrifugation (12,000 × g for 15 min), cells were resuspended and sonicated in 30 ml of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 50 mm NaCl, and 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol. The cell lysate was centrifuged at 19,000 × g for 20 min, and the soluble fraction was applied to a Q-Sepharose anion exchange column. Column elution was performed with a 50–200 mm NaCl gradient in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8. Maspin-containing fractions were further purified by immobilized metal affinity chromatography using a fast-flow chelating Sepharose column precharged with 5 mg/ml nickel chloride and equilibrated in 500 mm NaCl and 40 mm sodium phosphate, pH 8. Column elution was performed stepwise by decreasing pH, but maspin remained tightly bound to the column at pH 4.5 and was subsequently eluted with 50 mmEDTA in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8. Removal of the nickel and EDTA from the maspin fraction was achieved by ultrafiltration and dialysis. Type I collagen immobilized on agarose was equilibrated with 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, and 0.05% Brij35. rMaspin (0.1 mg/ml) was applied, and following extensive column washing with the above buffer, bound material was eluted with 125 mmTris-HCL, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, and 5% β-mercaptoethanol. Control experiments examining binding of rPAI-2 and rOvalbumin, which also contained polyhistidine N-terminal tags (25.McCarthy B.J. Worrall D.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 267: 561-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), were performed under identical conditions. Maspin (4 μg) was incubated with collagen type I (0.75–4 μg) for 30 min at 37 °C. The samples were electrophoresed on a 10% native gel in addition to a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Following transfer to nitrocellulose, membranes were incubated for 2 h with an IgM monoclonal antibody to human maspin (1:1000) followed by peroxidase-linked anti-IgM secondary antibody (1:2000). Membranes were developed by enhanced chemiluminescence and autoradiography. Collagen subtypes I, II, III, IV, and V, boiled collagen, and gelatin were applied at varying concentrations to a nitrocellulose membrane. Dot blots were blocked overnight at 4 °C with 4% BSA and then incubated for 2 h with a solution of recombinant maspin (20 μg/ml in 150 mm NaCl and 50 mm Tris, pH 7.6). Following stringent washing with 150 mm NaCl and 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.6, to remove unbound ligand, membranes were subsequently immunoblotted for maspin as described above. IAsys affinity sensor analysis experiments were conducted on the IAsys Plus apparatus (Affinity Sensors Ltd., Saxon Hill, Cambridge, UK). Binding reactions were carried out in an IAsys resonant mirror biosensor at 25 °C using planar aminosilane surfaces. Collagen type I was chemically immobilized to the surface according to the manufacturer's instructions. Collagen was made up in 10 mm sodium acetate, pH 5.0, and applied to the cuvette at 1 mg/ml, until saturation was achieved (∼300 arc s). Interaction analysis was conducted with varying concentrations of maspin ranging from 0.25–3 μm and made up in phosphate-buffered saline. In all experiments, BSA (30 μmin phosphate-buffered saline) was used as a control. Regeneration of the cuvette was achieved by repeated washes with 100 mmHCl. Results were analyzed with Fastfit software from IAsys. To identify the region of the maspin protein that interacts with collagen, truncated constructs of maspin cDNA were fused to LexA in pEG202 and tested for positive interaction against the collagen-containing pJG4–5 plasmid. In total, seven maspin cDNA fragments were amplified from recombinant pEG202/maspin. Four of these were amplified using a common forward oligonucleotide, primer A (described previously), in conjunction with each of the reverse primers G, H, I, and J (see Table I).Table IPrimer sequences and propertiesPrimer namePrimer sequencePrimer propertiesG5′-AAAGGATCCTCAGAT TGGAGAGAAGAGGAC-3′Antisense, maspin 82–101H5′-AAAGGATCCTTAGGG TCTCTTCGTAGAGCTG-3′Antisense, maspin 315–335I5′-AAAGGATCCTTAGTAGG CAGCATTAACCACAAGG-3′Antisense, maspin 477–499J5′-AAAGGATCCTCAATTG ATACTGTCAATGTTTCC-3′Antisense, maspin 619–641K5′-AAAGAATTCCTGTC ACTTGCTCAAGTGG-3′Sense, maspin 115–133L5′-AAAGAATTCTCACT GAAACTAATCAGCG-3′Sense, maspin 253–271M5′-AAAGAATTCGCAA AGGAATTGGAAACT-3′Sense, maspin 337–354 Open table in a new tab The remaining three maspin fragments were amplified using a common reverse oligonucleotide, primer J, in conjunction with each of the forward primers K, L, and M (see Table I). Reverse primers G, H, I, and J contain flanking BamHI restriction sites, and forward primers K, L, and M contain flanking EcoRI restriction sites. In addition, reverse primers G, H, I, and J contain reverse complimentary stop codons immediately preceding the BamHI restriction site. Amplification was carried out with 1.5 mm MgCl2 for 30 cycles of 94 °C × 1 min, 55 °C × 1 min, and 72 °C × 3 min. Amplified products were cloned by standard procedures into the EcoRI and BamHI restriction sites of pEG202. Recombinant pEG202 containing maspin truncations were each co-transformed with the collagen-containing pJG4–5 into S. cerevisiae EGY48. Collagen-maspin interactions were detected by both β-galactosidase and Leu-2 reporter gene expression. Expression of maspin cloned into the pEG202 vector was expected to yield a LexA fusion protein of 64 kDa. However, immunoblot analysis of transformed S. cerevisiae EGY48 cells with anti-LexA antibody indicated a fusion protein of ∼49 kDa (Fig. 1). Sequence analysis of the entire pEG202 insert ruled out the possibility of an incorporated stop codon during or subsequent to the initial PCR amplification step. The presence of protease inhibitors during preparation of yeast protein extracts also failed to produce full-length bait on immunoblots. This processing problem, which is most likely caused by intracellular proteolysis, was not resolved and would result in a fusion with 43% of the C terminus, including the reactive site loop, absent from the bait. However, additional work showing the expression of a fully intact LexA-PAI-2 fusion in S. cerevisiae EGY48 indicates that truncation of serpin baits within the LexA yeast two-hybrid system is not necessarily a general serpin phenomenon. Despite the apparent lack of full-length maspin protein, we proceeded with a yeast two-hybrid screen to detect possible interactants. Prior to screening, the truncated maspin bait was shown to be transcriptionally inert using the β-galactosidase assay (result not shown). A target human fibroblast cDNA library in the pJG4–5 plasmid was screened for expression of the Leu2 reporter gene and initially produced 50 positive interactor yeast clones. Of these, 10 failed to show transcription of the second reporter gene lacZ upon selection with 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactopyranoside (X-gal). The remaining positive clones were amplified from the target vector by PCR using primers specific to the vector arms. Four different sized inserts were selected, and dideoxy sequencing of the target plasmids was performed to identify the maspin interacting partner in each case (Fig. 2). The sequences identified were transketolase (U55017), metallothionein (BC008408), human elongation factor (BC018641), and type I collagen (Z74616). Of these, type I collagen was investigated further because collagen-binding serpins have been reported previously. The collagen insert in the target vector pJG4–5 consisted of 216 amino acids in the collagen α2(I) chain, and this was in the correct reading frame as a fusion with the transactivating domain of LexA. This sequence corresponds to bases 2261–2909 of prepro-α2(I) collagen (accession number Z74616), and the corresponding amino acids (708–923) are within the repetitive (Gly-X-Y)n sequence of the collagen chain. To further investigate the relevance of a collagen interaction with maspin, recombinant full-length maspin was produced for direct protein-protein interaction studies. Recombinant maspin produced in E. coli has been shown previously to retain its function as an inhibitor of tumor cell migration in vitro(3.Sheng S. Pemberton P.A. Sager R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30988-30993Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The maspin cDNA open reading frame sequence was cloned into the bacterial expression vector pRSETC, and the protein was subsequently produced in E. coli with an N-terminal polyhistidine tag. Maspin was purified by anion exchange and metal ion affinity chromatography (Fig. 3A). Binding of rMaspin to type I collagen immobilized to agarose was demonstrated (Fig. 3B). rMaspin bound to this affinity matrix in the presence of 150 mm NaCl, whereas recombinant PAI-2 produced in the same expression system (25.McCarthy B.J. Worrall D.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 267: 561-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) and also containing a polyhistidine tail did not bind under identical conditions (Fig. 3C). Recombinant ovalbumin produced similarly also failed to bind (results not shown). Native and SDS-polyacrylamide gels were performed following incubation of maspin with collagen type I. Immunoblot analysis showed a complex formation on native gels where maspin was significantly retarded in the presence of collagen (Fig. 4). No complexes were seen on SDS-PAGE analysis however, suggesting that the interaction is noncovalent. To investigate binding to other collagen subtypes, dot blots were performed by applying decreasing amounts of collagen subtypes I, II, III, IV, and V to nitrocellulose. The membrane was incubated with recombinant maspin at a concentration of 0.44 μm, and an anti-maspin IgM antibody was used to detect collagen-bound maspin. Collagen subtypes I and III were found to bind recombinant maspin, with 250 ng of each binding detectable amounts of maspin, whereas 2 μg of immobilized types II, IV, and V failed to bind maspin (Fig. 5). In addition, binding to thermally denatured collagen and gelatin (acid-denatured collagen) was examined, but in both cases maspin failed to bind (result not shown). The interaction between maspin and type I collagen was analyzed by fast association kinetics using IAsys affinity sensor technology. Collagen type I was coupled covalently to an aminosilane cuvette surface, and varying concentrations of recombinant maspin (0.25–3 μm) were applied. In a parallel control experiment, BSA (30 μm) was added to a collagen-coated aminosilane cuvette. All binding events were monitored in real time, and the rate of association of maspin to type I collagen increased with increasing maspin concentration (Fig. 6A). To determine a dissociation affinity constant (KD) for the maspin-collagen type I interaction, a plot of kon against ligand concentration was drawn (Fig. 6B). The slope of the line corresponds to the association rate constant ka (3.2 × 103m−1 s−1), and the y-intercept corresponds to the dissociation rate constant, kd(0.002 s−1). The KD is described by kd/ka and is calculated to be 0.63 × 10−6m. The specific protein region of maspin that interacts with collagen was investigated using yeast two-hybrid technology. A number of bait constructs were cloned in pEG202 to contain varying lengths of maspin cDNA, corresponding to amino acids 1–34, 1–112, 1–166, 1–214, 38–214, 84–214, and 112–214 of the maspin protein. Because the original screening bait appeared to be missing the C-terminal half of maspin, baits longer than 214 amino acids were not constructed. To perform one-on-one interactor analysis, the isolated collagen containing pJG4–5 plasmid was co-transformed with each of the maspin fragment pEG202 vectors into the two-hybrid yeast strain EGY48. The resulting transformants were subsequently assayed for β-galactosidase reporter gene expression to identify a maspin-collagen interaction. As expression of the collagen target from pJG4–5 is under the control of a Gal promotor, true interactor clones will form blue colonies when grown on galactose-containing medium and white colonies when grown on glucose-containing medium. In contrast, false positive interactor clones form blue colonies on glucose-containing media and denote a bait that can activate the reporter gene systems on its own. Results show that all maspin fragments except 112–214 interact with collagen (Fig. 7), and assays for the second reporter gene, Leu2, were in complete agreement (data not shown). However, the shortest maspin construct, 1–34, was found to be transcriptionally active in the absence of an interacting partner. Taken together, these results suggest that the interaction with collagen occurs within amino acids 84–112 of the maspin protein. The use of the yeast-two-hybrid protein interaction trap to identify serpin targets has not previously been reported, and the ability of the system to carry out post-translational modifications and correct folding of proteins such as serpins is uncertain. The LexA system gives relatively high expression of the binding domain fusion, allowing detection of bait fusion, and our results suggest that there may be a lack of expression of the full-length maspin. The product detected for the maspin construct indicates that the fusion protein lacks the C-terminal 43% of the serpin including the reactive loop, and if caused by proteolysis, this cleavage site would correspond to residues in the serpin structure lying between strands 1 and 2 of β-sheet B. However, PI-6 has been successfully expressed in an active form in Pichia pastoris (26.Sun J. Coughlin P. Salem H.H. Bird P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1252: 28-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), and these findings may be unique to the vector or the EGY48 yeast strain used in this study. Also, although no full-length product was detected on immunoblots, there may be a proportion of the entire fusion protein in vivo that could potentially pick up serpin reactive site loop interactions. Alternatively, the system may be useful for detecting novel protein interactions with serpin N-terminal sequences or other selected regions. The two-hybrid system has previously been used to successfully detect interactions between extracellular matrix components, demonstrating an association between collagen types IV and VI (27.Kuo H.J. Maslen C.L. Keene D.R. Glanville R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26522-26522.9Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). The positive result suggesting a potential interaction with collagen type I was further investigated in view of previous reports of other serpins binding to collagen. Colligin or heat shock protein 47 can bind procollagens 1 and IV and gelatin but not collagen type III (28.Jain N. Brickenden A. Lorimer I. Ball E.H. Sanwal B.D. Biochem. J. 1994; 304: 61-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 29.Ball E.H. Jain N. Sanwal B.D. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1997; 425: 239-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Colligin is localized to the endoplasmic reticulum and appears to act as a molecular chaperone in the protection of procollagen from intracellular degradation (30.Clarke E.P. Jain N. Brickenden A. Lorimer I.A. Sanwal B.D. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 193-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 31.Nagata K. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 22-26Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). Protease nexin-1 activity with thrombin is enhanced with binding of heparin sulfate glycoproteins, but its specificity is significantly altered by binding to collagen type IV, which decreases affinity for uPA and plasmin while leaving thrombin inhibition unaffected (32.Donovan F.M. Vaughan P.J. Cunningham D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17199-17205Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). More relevant is caspin (collagen associated serpin), which is identical to murine PEDF and can preferentially bind collagen types I and III (22.Kozaki K. Miyaishi O. Koiwai O. Yasui Y. Kashiwai A. Nishikawa Y. Shimizu S. Saga S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15125-15130Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). In mouse colon this protein is expressed at high levels in nonmetastatic clones and at low levels in high metastatic clones of adenocarcinoma cells, which is similar to the loss of maspin expression in mammary carcinoma. Human PEDF is a noninhibitory serpin with neurotrophic and neuronal survival activity (33.Steele F.R. Chader G.J. Johnson L.V. Tombran-Tink J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 1526-1530Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar, 34.Becerra S.P. Sagasti A. Spinella P. Notario V. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25992-25999Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar), which is independent of an intact reactive site loop. It can bind glycosaminoglycans (35.Alberdi E. Hyde C.C. Becerra S.P. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 10643-10652Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), and both recombinant and tissue-purified PEDF are potent inhibitors of angiogenesis (21.Dawson D.W. Volpert O.V. Gillis P. Crawford S.E. Xu H-J. Benedict W. Bouck N.P. Science. 1999; 285: 245-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (1413) Google Scholar). The yeast two-hybrid results were corroborated with protein-protein interactions with full-length maspin binding to type I collagen-agarose, whereas other similarly expressed recombinant serpins failed to do so. Most interestingly, binding studies with different collagen subtypes showed maspin-binding types I and III but not II, IV, and V, a profile identical to murine PEDF. Collagen types I and III are widely distributed, representing 70 and 25%, respectively, of total collagen content in normal breast tissue. They are abundant neomatrix components in invasive breast carcinomas (36.Wapnir I.L. Southard H. Chen G. Friedman J. Boyd C.D. Amenta P.S. Invasion Metastasis. 1996; 16: 308-316PubMed Google Scholar) and present a physical barrier to metastasizing cells. The physiological significance of this finding is further supported by findings that maspin is present at the cell surface of mammary myoepithelial cells (11.Pemberton P.A. Tipton A.R. Pavloff N. Smith J. Erickson J.R. Mouchabeck Z.M. Kiefer M.C. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1997; 45: 1697-1706Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar), a localization that would automatically facilitate a contact with these extracellular matrix components. The dissociation affinity constant of maspin for collagen type I was estimated in this study to be 0.63 μm, which is within the range (0.3–3 μm) used to show murine PEDF binding to collagen by surface plasmon resonance (22.Kozaki K. Miyaishi O. Koiwai O. Yasui Y. Kashiwai A. Nishikawa Y. Shimizu S. Saga S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15125-15130Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). It is also similar to the concentration of maspin (0.44 μm) used to alter the integrin profile of MDA-MB-435 cells (13.Seftor R.E.B. Seftor E.A. Sheng S. Pemberton P.A. Sager R. Hendrix M.J.C. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 5681-5685PubMed Google Scholar), to achieve inhibition of metastasis (0.17 μm) in in vitro invasion assays (3.Sheng S. Pemberton P.A. Sager R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30988-30993Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and to inhibit angiogenesis (0.2–0.3 μm) (4.Zhang M. Volpert O Shi Y.H. Bouck N. Nat. Med. 2000; 6: 196-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar). The fact that the interaction was detected in the intracellular yeast system indicates that glycosylation of maspin or collagen is not required for binding, in contrast to some serpin-glycosaminoglycan interactions. At this stage, using the two-hybrid system, we have narrowed down the collagen-binding region of maspin to amino acids 84–112. This corresponds with evidence that colligin binding is localized to amino acids 104–169 (29.Ball E.H. Jain N. Sanwal B.D. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1997; 425: 239-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar), which aligns with residues 65–116 of maspin and suggests the existence of a general collagen-binding motif in serpins that remains to be well defined. In contrast to cell migration effects, the inhibition of angiogenesis by maspin was found to be independent of the C-terminal sequence but appeared to require the N-terminal 139 amino acids, suggesting that this function may coincide with the collagen-binding site. The finding that maspin can alter the integrin profile of MDA-MB-435 cells provides evidence that maspin may prevent invasion by increasing the anchoring of cells to the extracellular matrix. This has been demonstrated more directly in corneal stromal cells where exogenous recombinant maspin has been found to restore cell adhesion in stromal cells as measured by increased adhesion to collagen type I and other extracellular matrix components (14.Ngamkitidechakul C. Burke J.M. O'Brien W.J. Twining S.S. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2001; 42: 3135-3141PubMed Google Scholar). A direct adherence to both collagen and an uncharacterized cell surface receptor for maspin may be an explanation for these findings. As found with other serpin-ligand interactions, it is possible that collagen binding may alter the structural conformation of maspin, being necessary for either stability or for receptor binding, or for active presentation of the maspin reactive site loop. In conclusion, using yeast two-hybrid technology, we provide evidence that the N-terminal region of maspin can bind collagen types I and III. This interaction may contribute to the function of maspin as a tumor suppressor and angiogenesis inhibitor either by direct adherence between cell surface maspin and extracellular matrix collagen or by altering the ability of maspin to interact with other proteins.

This heme differs from heme B (protoheme) at two carbon positions of the porphyrin ring. The synthesis of heme A begins with farnesylation of the vinyl group at carbon C-2 of heme B. The heme O product of this reaction is then converted to heme A by a further oxidation of a methyl to a formyl group on C-8. In a previous study (Barros, M. H., Carlson, C. G., Glerum, D. M., and Tzagoloff, A. (2001) FEBS Lett.492, 133–138) we proposed that the formyl group is formed by an initial hydroxylation of the C-8 methyl by a three-component monooxygenase consisting of Cox15p, ferredoxin, and ferredoxin reductase. In the present study three lines of evidence confirm a requirement of ferredoxin in heme A synthesis. 1) Temperature-conditional yah1 mutants grown under restrictive conditions display a decrease in heme A relative to heme B. 2) The incorporation of radioactive δ-aminolevulinic acid into heme A is reduced in yah1 ts but not in the wild type after the shift to the restrictive temperature; and 3) the overexpression of Cox15p in cytochrome oxidase mutants that accumulate heme O leads to an increased mitochondrial concentration of heme A. The increase in heme A is greater in mutants that overexpress Cox15p and ferredoxin. These results are consistent with a requirement of ferredoxin and indirectly of ferredoxin reductase in hydroxylation of heme O.

These results are consistent with a requirement of ferredoxin and indirectly of ferredoxin reductase in hydroxylation of heme O. cytochrome oxidase high pressure liquid chromatography Heme A is a prosthetic group confined exclusively to mitochondrial and some bacterial cytochrome oxidases. Heme A differs from heme B (protoheme) at the porphyrin carbons C-2, where a vinyl group is replaced by a farnesyl group, and at C-8, where there is a formyl instead of a methyl substituent (1Caughey W.S. Smythe G.A. O'Keeffe D.H. Maskasky J.E. Smith M.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 7602-7622Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The first step in heme A biosynthesis is a farnesylation of the vinyl at C-2 of heme B (2Saiki K. Mogi T. Ogura K. Anraku Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26041-26044Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). InSaccharomyces cerevisiae this reaction, resulting in heme O, is catalyzed by a mitochondrial farnesyl transferase encoded byCOX10 1 (3Nobrega M.P. Nobrega F.G. Tzagoloff A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 14220-14226Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 4Tzagoloff A. Nobrega M. Gorman N. Sinclair P. Biochem. Mol. Biol. Int. 1993; 31: 593-598PubMed Google Scholar). Heme O itself is a prosthetic group in some bacterial cytochrome oxidases (5Puustinen A. Wikstrom M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 6122-6126Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). The further conversion of heme O to heme A probably involves a monooxygenase-catalyzed hydroxylation of the methyl group at C-8. The resultant alcohol would then be further oxidized to the aldehyde. In a screen of cytochrome oxidase-deficient yeast strains for lesions in heme A biosynthesis, only cox15 mutants were found to have heme O but not heme A. This observation led us to propose that Cox15p catalyzes the hydroxylation of the C-8 methyl group (6Barros M.H. Carlson C.G. Glerum D.M. Tzagoloff A. FEBS Lett. 2001; 492: 133-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). According to this mechanism, oxidation of the methyl to the alcohol is catalyzed by a three-component monooxygenase that includes Cox15p, mitochondrial ferredoxin, and ferredoxin reductase, encoded byYAH1 and ARH1, respectively (7Barros M.H. Nobrega F.G. Gene (Amst.). 1999; 233: 197-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 8Manzella L. Barros M.H. Nobrega F.G. Yeast. 1998; 14: 839-846Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). In the present study we have further assessed the role of ferredoxin in heme A synthesis. Temperature-sensitive yah1 mutants have been used to measure heme A synthesis over a range of temperatures that elicit the increasing loss of ferredoxin activity. The ts mutants have also been used to measure the incorporation of δ-aminolevulinic acid into heme A following the shift to the non-permissive temperature. Finally, we have examined the effect of overexpression of ferredoxin and Cox15p singly or in combination on the heme composition of various yeast mutants. The results of these studies strongly support the involvement of ferredoxin and by inference of ferredoxin reductase in heme A synthesis.

Total heme was extracted from 2 mg of mitochondrial protein with 0.5 ml of acetone containing 2.5% HCl. The mixture was vortexed, clarified by centrifugation, and mixed with an equal volume of 50% acetonitrile. Insoluble material was removed by a second centrifugation. The extract was adjusted to approximately pH 3.5 with 1.65 m ammonium hydroxide, clarified by centrifugation, and applied to a 3.9 × 300 mm C18 Bondclone column (Phenomenex, Torrance, CA). Hemes were eluted at a flow rate of 1 ml/min using a 30–50% acetonitrile gradient over the first 5 ml, followed by a 50–75% linear acetonitrile gradient over the subsequent 35 ml. The acetonitrile solutions contained 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid. The elution of heme compounds was monitored at 400 nm. Fluorescent porphyrin compounds were monitored at an excitation wavelength of 400 nm and an emission wavelength of 600 nm. The elution times are affected by the pH of the sample applied to the column. The elution time of heme B was determined with a commercial preparation. The heme A standard was extracted from partially purified cytochrome oxidase, and heme O fromEscherichia coli.

The 1.475-kb product was digested with BamHI and HindIII and ligated to YIp351-GAL and YIplac204-GAL, yielding plasmids pGCOX15–1 and pGCOX15–3, respectively. The one-step gene insertion method (15Rothstein R.J.

Antibodies were obtained against Cox15p expressed from a trpE fusion gene. The 648-bp PstI-SacI fragment containing the region of COX15 coding for 216 carboxyl-terminal residues of Cox15p was fused in-frame to the amino-terminal half of trpE in pATH21 (16Koerner T.J.

E. coli transformed with this plasmid expresses a fusion protein of about 53 kDa, constituting most of the insoluble proteins of the cells. This fraction was dissolved in a 10 mm Tris-HCl, 1mm EDTA (pH 7.5) buffer containing 2% SDS, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 20 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and was further purified on a Bio-Gel A 0.5 column developed with a buffer containing 10 mm Tris-HCl, 0.1mm EDTA, and 5 mmβ-mercaptoethanol. Fractions enriched for the fusion protein were pooled, concentrated by acetone precipitation, and used to raise antibodies in rabbits. YAH1 temperature-sensitive mutants were obtained by PCR amplification of the wild type gene in pYAH/ST1 (7Barros M.H. Nobrega F.G. Gene (Amst.). 1999; 233: 197-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) under mutagenic conditions. The primers used for the synthesis were 5′-CCTATTTTTTCTCTGCAGCAATGC and 5′-AATCTTTCAAAGCTTGTAGCAGTT. Synthesis of the gene was carried out in four separate reactions containing 0.25 mm MnCl2, 1.5 mmMgCl2, and 0.2 mm dITP. In each reaction the concentration of one of the four deoxynucleotides was reduced from 0.2 to 0.02 mm. To construct the mutant library, the four 950-bp products were pooled and cloned in the centromeric plasmid YCp22 containing the TRP1 marker (14Gietz R.D. Sugino A. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 74: 527-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (2522) Google Scholar). This library was used to transform the diploid heterozygous mutant strain a/αW303ΔYAH1. Tryptophan-independent transformants obtained after several days of incubation of the selective plates at 30 °C were pooled and spread on potassium acetate sporulation medium. After 3 days, meiotic progeny issued from the diploid transformants were selected at 30 °C for both uracil (gene disruption marker) and tryptophan (plasmid marker) prototrophy. The Trp+ and Ura+ colonies were replicated on two YPD plates and incubated overnight at 30 °C and 37 °C. Two mutants (W303ΔYAH1/CR4, W303ΔYAH1/CR4) displaying lethality at 37 °C were purified, and their plasmids (pYAH1/CR4, pYAH1/CR5) were used to back-transform the original diploid mutant strain. The plasmid dependence of the ts phenotype in the second generation transformants was confirmed by segregation and tetrad analysis. The sequences of the yah1 genes in pYAH1/CR4 and pYAH1/CR5 were each found to have six different base substitutions leading to amino acid changes in ferredoxin. The protein encoded by pYAH1/CR4 had the following mutations: L39F, S71C, P122L, I146T, K150E, and P160L. The last three mutations were at conserved residues. The mutations in the protein encoded by pYAH1/CR5 were S15P, P57L, E59D, P120Q, G135W, and S172R. Only one mutation (G135W) was at a conserved residue. Previously identifiedcox15 mutants (47 independent strains) (9Tzagoloff A. Dieckmann C.L. Microbiol. Rev. 1990; 54: 211-225Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) were screened for temperature-sensitive revertants. Each strain was grown in YPD, and 107 cells were plated on YEPG. Spontaneous revertants were collected after up to 1 week of incubation of the YEPG plates at 30 °C. The revertants were purified and tested for temperature-sensitive growth on YEPG. From the 47 original mutants, 8 produced revertants of which 2 (C126/R and P147/R) exhibited slower growth at 37 °C. Standard procedures were used for the preparation and ligation of DNA fragments and for transformation and recovery of plasmid DNA from E. coli (17Maniatis T. Fritsch E.F. Sambrook J. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1982Google Scholar). Yeast was transformed by the method of Schiestl and Gietz (18Schiestl R.H. Gietz R.D. Curr. Genet. 1989; 16: 339-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (1773) Google Scholar). Total mitochondrial proteins were separated by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the buffer system of Laemmli (19Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207231) Google Scholar), and Western blots were treated with antibodies against the appropriate proteins followed by a second reaction with anti-mouse or anti-rabbit IgG conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Sigma). Cox15p was detected on Western blots with the antibody against the trpE fusion protein (see above), and Yah1p and Cox15p-Yah1p were detected with an antibody against a short synthetic peptide with a Yah1p sequence (7Barros M.H. Nobrega F.G. Gene (Amst.). 1999; 233: 197-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The antibody-antigen complexes were visualized by the SuperSignal chemiluminescent substrate kit (Pierce). Cytochrome oxidase mutants generally have greatly reduced concentrations of heme A and variably elevated amounts of heme O in their mitochondria. In contrast, cox15 mutants are not only deficient in heme A but also have the lowest concentration of heme O of all the mutants analyzed. The reason for the failure ofcox15 mutants to accumulate heme O is not clear but could signal the positive regulation of heme B farnesylation by heme A or the product of Cox15p. Alternatively, heme O could be less stable incox15 than in other cytochrome oxidase mutants. The accumulation of heme O in some cytochrome oxidase mutants made it possible to look at the effect of increased Cox15p, ferredoxin, or a combination of the two on in vivoconversion of this intermediate to heme A. To overexpress Cox15p, mutants were transformed with an integrative plasmid containingCOX15 under the control of the GAL10 promoter (GAL10-COX15 fusion). YAH1 coding for mitochondrial ferredoxin was introduced on a high copy episomal plasmid. To ensure retention of the YAH1-bearing plasmid, all the strains transformed with this gene had a null yah1allele in addition to the mutations in the cytochrome oxidase specific genes. The extent of the increase of Cox15p and ferredoxin in the mitochondria of strains transformed with these plasmids was estimated to be at least 20-fold (Fig. 1). Mitochondrial hemes of cells grown in YPGal were quantitated by HPLC. The results comparing the effect of Cox15p and ferredoxin alone or of the two together on the concentrations of heme A and heme O in acox11 mutant background are shown in Fig.2. The function of Cox11p in yeast is likely to be the same as in Rhodobacter where the homologous protein has been shown to be required for biogenesis of the CuB center in subunit 1 (20Di Hiser L. Valentin M. Hamer A.G. Hosler J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 619-623Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). The values for heme A are normalized to heme B, the concentration of which in different mutants is relatively constant. These results show that integration of theGAL10-COX15 fusion into the chromosomal DNA of the mutant elicits a 20-fold increase in heme A (Fig. 2 C). The heme A content was increased by another factor of four in cells overexpressing both Cox15p and ferredoxin (Fig. 2 D). No increase of heme A was observed in mutant cells transformed with the high copyYAH1 plasmid (Fig. 2 B). The ratio of heme O to heme B in these strains changed inversely to the heme A/heme B ratio.Figure 2Effect of overexpression of Cox15p and/or ferredoxin on the mitochondrial concentration of heme A and heme O in acox11 mutant.

Genet. 1988; 211: 492-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), and IMP2 codes for a subunit of the intermembrane protease that processes mitochondrial proteins, including the precursor form of subunit 2 of cytochrome oxidase (22Jan P.S. Esser K. Pratje E. Michaelis G. Mol. Gen. Genet. 2000; 263: 483-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The introduction of theGAL10-COX15 fusion alone increased the heme A concentration in these mutants as it did in the cox11 mutant, and when combined with the YAH1 the effect was even more pronounced (Fig. 3). This was especially evident in the imp2 mutant where overexpression of both proteins raised the heme A content to half of that seen in wild type yeast. Although the increase in heme A in the imp2 mutant was accompanied by a decrease in heme O, this was not true of the sco1 mutant in which both heme O and heme A were increased when the mutant was transformed with the two genes (data not shown). To facilitate further experiments on the role of ferredoxin in heme A synthesis, temperature-sensitive yah1 mutants were obtained by low stringency PCR amplification of the gene. The doubling times in the rich glucose medium of the wild type W303-1A and twoyah1 ts mutants, W303ΔYAH1/CR4 and W303ΔYAH1/CR5, were determined before and after the shift from 30 °C to 37 °C. Both mutants and the wild type had generation times of ∼2 h at 30 °C in this medium. The growth of W303ΔYAH1/CR5 was arrested completely 1.5 h after the shift to 37 °C (Fig.4 A). Although the generation time of W303ΔYAH1/CR4 was also affected at the restrictive temperature, the effect was not as pronounced. Growth of this mutant was six times slower 1.5 h after the shift to 37 °C. As expected, the wild type strain grew about two times slower at 37 °C. Similar growth kinetics were observed in rich YPGal. Growth of the cox15 revertant P146/R in liquid YEPG confirmed visual observations of its partial temperature sensitivity on solid medium. Although P146/R grew almost as well as the wild type at 30 °C, its growth was 3–4 times slower compared with the wild type at 37 °C (Fig. 4 B) The requirement of Cox15p and ferredoxin for heme A synthesis was examined by measuring the concentrations of heme A relative to heme B in the mitochondria of cells grown at different temperatures. Even though the doubling times of W303ΔYAH1/CR4 and W303ΔYAH1/CR5 are considerably longer at higher temperatures, enough cells can be obtained even at 34 °C for mitochondrial heme analyses. The wild type and the three ts mutants were grown at 27 °C, 32.5 °C, and 34 °C in a rich galactose medium. Mitochondria were prepared and their hemes separated by HLPC. The ratios of the heme A to heme B were determined for each strain grown at the three different temperatures. The results of these analyses, summarized in Fig.5, indicate that whereas the ratio of heme A to heme B in the wild type is constant over the temperature range examined, it decreases progressively as a function of increasing temperature in the mutants. It is noteworthy that the more severe the temperature sensitivity the lower the ratio at all temperatures measured, indicating partial loss of activity even at the permissive temperature. The lowest ratio was observed in W303ΔYAH1/CR5, the more stringent of the two yah1 mutants. The cox15mutant, the growth of which is least affected at the restrictive temperature, also shows the least decrease in the ratio of heme A to heme B. δ-Aminolevulinic acid is a specific precursor of heme (23Shemin D. Russel C.S. Abramsky T. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1953; 75: 4873-4875Crossref Scopus (141) Google Scholar). The incorporation of this precursor into heme A was compared at 30 and 37 °C in the wild type and the yah1mutants W303ΔYAH1/R4 and W303ΔYAH1/R5. Cells grown at 30 °C were transferred to medium containing radioactive δ-aminolevulinic and were further incubated at 30 and 37 °C. Hemes were extracted from zymolyase-treated cells or mitochondria and separated by reverse phase chromatography, and the radioactivity associated with heme B and heme A was determined. The results of one such experiment, illustrated in Fig.6, show the incorporation of the radioactive precursor into heme B and heme A at 30 and 37 °C in the wild type and the ts mutant W303ΔYAH1/R5. The ratio of counts in heme A to heme B was not much different at the two temperatures in the wild type, but was reduced at 37 °C in the mutant. Despite the poor labeling of heme probably as a result of inefficient uptake of δ-aminolevulinic in yeast, the results of several experiments indicated a consistent decrease of heme A labeling at 37 °C in bothyah1 ts mutants but not in the wild type (TableII). No radioactivity was detected in heme O at either temperature. This is probably due to the failure of mutants blocked in heme A synthesis to accumulate heme O.Table IIIncorporation of δ-[3H]aminolevulinic acid into heme A and heme B in wild type and yah1 ts mutantsW303ΔYAH/CR5ΔYAH/CR430°C37°C30°C37°C30°C37°CExp. 1Heme A (cpm)47311972004810130Heme B (cpm)242783481196270010341087A/B0.190.140.170.020.100.03Exp. 2Heme A (cpm)6185125276325Heme B (cpm)2263358786955581131A/B0.270.250.140.040.110.02Exp. 3Heme A (cpm)1101109815--Heme B (cpm)365306550350--A/B0.30.360.170.04--In experiment 1 (Exp. 1) hemes were extracted from zymolyase-treated cells.

In mammals, ferredoxin (adrenodoxin) together with ferredoxin reductase and cytochrome P450 have been shown to catalyze hydroxylation of cholesterol to pregnenolone (24Simpson E.R. Boyd G.S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1966; 24: 10-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). In contrast to cytochrome P450, which is detected only in the mitochondria of steroidogenic tissues, ferredoxin and ferredoxin reductase are found in the mitochondria of widely divergent sources (25Picado-Leonard J.

This suggestion is supported by recent evidence that in yeast, ferredoxin (27Lange H. Kaut A. Kispal G. Lill R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 1050-1055Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar, 28Lill R.E. Kispal G. Trends Biochem.

Chem. 2001; 276: 1503-1509Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar) play a role in the assembly of iron-sulfur clusters. Because iron-sulfur clusters are present not only in mitochondria but in many cytoplasmic proteins, ferredoxin and its reductase are essential for cell viability (7Barros M.H. Nobrega F.G. Gene (Amst.). 1999; 233: 197-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 8Manzella L. Barros M.H. Nobrega F.G. Yeast. 1998; 14: 839-846Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). In an earlier paper we proposed still another function for ferredoxin in heme A biosynthesis (6Barros M.H. Carlson C.G. Glerum D.M. Tzagoloff A. FEBS Lett. 2001; 492: 133-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). The conversion of heme O to heme A is likely to involve an initial hydroxylation of the C-8 methyl. This reaction is probably catalyzed by a three-component monooxygenase consisting of Cox15p, ferredoxin, and ferredoxin reductase (6Barros M.H. Carlson C.G. Glerum D.M. Tzagoloff A. FEBS Lett. 2001; 492: 133-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). The evidence for Cox15p as a component of the monooxygenase was based on the presence of heme O but not heme A incox15 mutants (6Barros M.H. Carlson C.G. Glerum D.M. Tzagoloff A. FEBS Lett. 2001; 492: 133-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Cox15p also shares weak sequence similarity to the bacterial CtaA protein that had been implicated to have a function in the synthesis of heme A from heme O (30Svensson B. Hederstedt L. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 6663-6671Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 31Svensson B. Lubben M. Hederstedt L. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 10: 193-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The presence of a single fusion gene composed ofCOX15 and YAH1 in Schizosaccharomyces pombe (GenBankTM accession no. Z70043) further suggested that the two proteins might be functionally related. This was consistent with the notion that the hydroxylation step may be catalyzed by a P450-like monooxygenase deriving electrons from NADPH or NADH through ferredoxin. The present studies were undertaken to obtain more direct evidence for the essentiality of ferredoxin in heme A synthesis. The synthesis of heme A relative to heme B in temperature-sensitive ferredoxin mutants is reduced as a function of increased temperature. Similarly, incorporation of the heme precursor, δ-aminolevulinic acid, is substantially less in the yah1mutants than in the wild type following the shift to the non-permissive temperature. Both observations are consistent with a role of ferredoxin in heme A synthesis. The partial temperature-sensitive cox15allele also caused a progressive decline in the heme A/heme B ratio in cells grown at increasingly higher temperatures. Mutations in a large number of genes affecting the expression of cytochrome oxidase produce a general phenotype, the features of which include the absence of cytochromes a anda 3 and greatly reduced steady state levels of the subunits constituting the catalytic core of the enzyme (10Glerum D.M.

Chem. 2000; 275: 14898-14902Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Such mutants are also severely deficient in heme A but not heme O, which accumulates to different extents depending on the mutant (6Barros M.H. Carlson C.G. Glerum D.M. Tzagoloff A. FEBS Lett. 2001; 492: 133-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). 2M. H. Barros, F. G. Nobrega, and A. Tzagoloff, unpublished observations. The increase of heme O in cytochrome oxidase mutants was taken advantage of to determine whether the heme A content could be raised by overexpression of Cox15 and/or ferredoxin. The concentration of heme A was not significantly affected by ferredoxin but in some cases could be increased by as much as 40-fold in mutants transformed withCOX15 (Fig. 3). Heme A was even higher in mutants transformed with both COX15 and YAH1. In addition to supporting the involvement of Cox15p and ferredoxin in heme A synthesis, these data suggest that normally Cox15p is more limiting than ferredoxin or the reductase in the hydroxylation of heme O. In mutants transformed with the GAL10-COX15 fusion gene, however, ferredoxin appears to be more limiting than Cox15p. Heme A is barely detectable in the imp2 mutant, and its concentration is raised to approximately half that of the wild type in cells overexpressing COX15 and YAH1. Even though the concentration of Cox15p in the mutant is not appreciably different from that in the wild type, it has 45 times more heme O than the wild type (data not shown). The low concentration of heme A, therefore, cannot be a consequence of the lower expression of COX15. The ability of such mutants to accumulate large amounts of heme O, the structure of which is closely related to heme A, also tends to argue against degradation as the cause of the heme A deficit. A more plausible explanation at present is that the pathway is down-regulated when assembly of the enzyme is blocked. The failure of cox15 mutants to accumulate heme O in amounts comparable with other cytochrome oxidase mutants (6Barros M.H. Carlson C.G. Glerum D.M. Tzagoloff A. FEBS Lett. 2001; 492: 133-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar) suggests that farnesylation of protoheme may also be regulated by a downstream product such as the hydroxylated intermediate or by heme A itself.

E2 early promoter activity is regulated by adenovirus E1A protein, which controls the activity of the E2F transcription factor by targeting the tumor suppressor protein pRB (7Kovesdi I. Reichel R.

In eukaryotes, increased expression of Y box proteins in somatic cells is associated with drug resistance and a malignant phenotype (15Bargou R.C. Jürchott K. Wagener C. Bergmann S. Metzner S. Bommert K. Mapara M.Y. Winzer K.J. Dietel M. Dörken B. Royer H.D. Nat. Med. 1997; 3: 447-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar), and it was discussed that Y box proteins are involved in activating certain genes that are expressed in the S phase of the cell cycle (16Swamynathan S.K. Nambiar A. Guntaka R.V. FASEB J. 1998; 12: 515-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Recently, it has been reported that a major protein in messenger ribonucleoprotein particles in somatic cells is a member of the Y box-binding transcription factor family that acts either as a repressor or an activator of protein synthesis (17Evdokimova V.M. Ovchinnikov L.P. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1999; 31: 139-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). YB-1 is also involved in regulating mRNA stability (18Chen C.Y. Gherzi R. Andersen J.S. Gaietta G. Jürchott K. Royer H.D. Mann M. Karin M. Genes Dev. 2000; 15: 1236-1248Google Scholar). In addition, it has been shown that YB-1 interacts with p53 (19Okamoto T. Izumi H. Imamura T. Takano H. Ise T. Uchiumi T. Kuwano M. Kohno K. Oncogene. 2000; 14: 6194-6202Crossref Scopus (134) Google Scholar), represses fas gene expression (20Lasham A. Lindridge E. Rudert F. Onrust R. Watson J. Gene (Amst.). 2000; 11: 1-13Crossref Scopus (113) Google Scholar), and promotes splicing of the adenoviral E1A pre-mRNA (21Chansky H.A. Hu M. Hickstein D.D. Yang L. Cancer Res. 2001; 6: 3586-3590Google Scholar). This suggests that YB-1 plays a significant role in the coordinated control of transcription, splicing, and translation in mammalian cells. Furthermore, Y box proteins are important host cell factors for several animal and human viruses. For example, it was shown that a Y box protein interacts specifically with the long terminal repeat of Rous sarcoma virus (22Faber M. Seally L. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 22243-22254Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, YB-1 is a transcriptional regulator of human polyomavirus JC (23Safak M. Gallia G.L. Ansari S.A. Khalili K. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 10146-10157Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (24Ansari S.A. Safak M. Gallia G.L. Sawaya B.E. Amini S Khalili K. J. Gen. Virol. 1999; 80: 2629-2638Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar).Here we report a novel function of E1B-55kDa in adenovirus replication. We show that E1B-55kDa facilitates nuclear accumulation of YB-1, which is associated with an induction of E2 gene transcription. We demonstrate a specific interaction of YB-1 with the promoter proximal Y box of the E2 late promoter and show that YB-1 controls E2 late promoter activity. Our data reveal that the viral E1B-55kDa protein and the host cell factor YB-1 act jointly to control E2 gene expression at later stages of infection.DISCUSSIONWe report here that the Y box protein YB-1 is a previously unrecognized cellular factor involved in controlling adenovirus replication. Our data indicate that YB-1 induces E2 gene transcription by activating the E2 late promoter thereby permitting adenovirus DNA replication to a level comparable with a wild type adenovirus. We investigated how E2 late promoter activation by YB-1 is brought about. We have shown that YB-1 interacts specifically with the promoter proximal Y box at position −72 in the E2 late promoter, and we demonstrated that a mutation of the promoter proximal Y box abolished activity of an E2 late minimal promoter fragment. We have thus identified YB-1 as transcriptional activator of the E2 genes. Future experiments will reveal whether the other two Y boxes of the E2 late promoter at positions −135 and −229 interact with YB-1 and whether these Y boxes contribute to E2 late promoter activity. In this context, it is interesting to note that an unidentified factor has been described which binds to all three Y boxes of the E2 late promoter (11Goding C.R. Temperley S.M. Fisher F. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 7761-7780Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar).We investigated whether YB-1 and E1B-55kDa interact with each otherin vivo and have addressed this question by immunoprecipitation studies. We were unable to detect any interactions by this method.2 Our data demonstrate that YB-1 relocates to the nucleus in adenovirus-infected cells in an E1B-55kDa-dependent manner. We have thus identified a previously unrecognized control function of E1B-55kDa. We think that targeting of YB-1 to the nucleus is required for Ad5 E2 late promoter activation in vivo. Our results with the transient reporter gene assays (Fig. 6) support this consideration strongly. Thus, E1B-55kDa is involved in controlling adenovirus DNA replication at later stages of infection. This is in contrast to the function of E1A which controls E2 gene expression early in infection through the E2 early promoter. It is well established that E1A is targeting the E2F transcription factor (7Kovesdi I. Reichel R. Nevins J.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 2180-2184Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 34Manohar C.F. Kratochvil J. Thimmapaya B. J. Virol. 1990; 64: 2457-2466Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which is also regulated by products of the adenovirus E4 genes (35Marton M.J. Baim S.B. Ornelles D.A. Shenk T. J. Virol. 1990; 64: 2345-2359Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 36Obert S. O'Connor R.J. Hearing P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1333-1346Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 37Reichel R. Neill S.D. Kovesdi I. Simon M.C. Raychaudhuri P. Nevins J.R. J. Virol. 1989; 63: 3643-3650Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Taken together the results from the literature and our results show that E1A and E1B act jointly in controlling timed E2 gene transcription during a lytic life cycle of an adenovirus.In Ad5-infected cells YB-1 is associated with nuclear viral inclusion bodies (Fig. 3). However, in Ad312-ı́nfected cells YB-1 was distributed diffusely in the nuclei (Fig. 2 B). Ad312 lacks the E1A gene, and it is thus tempting to speculate that E1A is required for the formation of viral inclusion bodies and for the association of E1B with these structures. This speculation is corroborated by the fact that the association of E1B-55kDa with viral nuclear inclusion bodies depends on the presence of adenovirus E4 gene products (32Ornelles D.A. Shenk T. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 424-429Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and it is known that E4 gene expression is controlled by E1A. We observed in preliminary experiments using an E1-minus virus expressing E1B-55kDa as a transgene (AdE1B55k) that that the sole expression of E1B-55kDa was not sufficient for nuclear YB-1 accumulation (unpublished data). In contrast, in 293 cells, which constitutively express E1A and E1B, YB-1 was diffusely distributed in the nuclei.2 These findings indicate that regulation of YB-1 intracellular movements in adenovirus-infected cells is apparently complex.Adenovirus Ad5 E1B-55kDa is a multifunctional protein. During the early phase of infection, E1B-55kDa counteracts E1A functions that would otherwise lead to the stabilization of p53 and the induction of apoptosis (38Chiou S.K. White E. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 3515-3525Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 39Debbas M. White E. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 546-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (831) Google Scholar, 40Lowe S.W. Ruley H.E.

In the late phase, E1B-55kDa functions in a complex with the E4orf6 gene product (42Sarnow P. Hearing P. Anderson C.W. Halbert D.N. Shenk T. Levine A.J. J. Virol. 1984; 49: 692-700Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 43Rubenwolf S. Schutt H. Nevels M. Wolf H. Dobner T. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 1115-1123Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) to stimulate accumulation and translation of the viral late mRNAs (25Pilder S. Moore M. Logan J. Shenk T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1986; 6: 470-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar, 44Halbert D.N. Cutt J.R. Shenk T. J. Virol. 1985; 56: 250-257Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 45Babiss L.E. Ginsberg H.S. J.

Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1995; 199: 139-171PubMed Google Scholar). This is accomplished by shutting off host mRNA nuclear export and host protein synthesis (48Babiss L.E. Ginsberg H.S. Darnell J.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1985; 5: 2552-2558Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar, 49Beltz G.A. Flint S.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 131: 353-373Crossref Scopus (123) Google Scholar). It was originally believed that targeting of p53 by E1B-55kDa is an important step in adenovirus replication (50Bischoff J.R. Kim D.H. Williams A. Heise C. Horn C. Muna M. Ng L. Nye J.A. Sampson-Johannes A. Fattaey A. McCormick F. Science. 1996; 274: 373-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (1558) Google Scholar). For example, Ad5 E1B-55kDa interacts with the cell cycle regulator p53, inhibits the transactivation domain of p53 (51Yew P. Berk A.J. Nature. 1992; 357: 82-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar), and relocalizes p53 to the cytoplasm (52van den Heuvel S.J. van Laar T. van der Eb A.J. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 5226-5234Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, several groups recently reported that adenovirus replication is independent of the status of p53 (53Harada J.N. Berk A.J. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 5333-5344Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 54Goodrum F.D. Ornelles D.A. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 9479-9490Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 55Turnell A.S. Grand R.J.A. Gallimore P.H. J.

Hengstermann A. Whitaker N.J. Scheffner M. zur Hausen H. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 9470-9478Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We have shown here that YB-1 facilitates adenovirus DNA replication by controlling E2 gene transcription via the E2 late promoter. It thus appears that targeting of YB-1 by E1B-55kDa is a crucial step in the process of viral DNA replication later in infection. In light of our findings and the results from the literature (53Harada J.N. Berk A.J. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 5333-5344Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 54Goodrum F.D. Ornelles D.A. J.

Virol. 1998; 72: 9470-9478Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), further work is needed to determine exactly the significance of p53 in the process of adenovirus DNA replication. It was reported that activation of the E2 early promoter is insufficient to promote the early to late phase transition during the life cycle of an adenovirus (58Hemström C. Virtanen A. Bridge E. Ketner G. Pettersson U. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 1440-1449Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We have identified here YB-1 as a cellular factor controlling the early to late phase transition during the life cycle of an adenovirus. Moreover YB-1 permits completion of a lytic viral life cycle. The E1-deleted AdYB-1 virus not only replicated its viral genome to almost the wild type level but also produced virus particles as was shown by electron microscopy (Fig. 8 A). We found that 20% of the AdYB-1-infected cells contained viral particles. Similar results were reported by Goodrum and Ornelles (59Goodrum F.D. Ornelles D.A. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 548-561Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) using an E1B-55kDa-deleted adenovirus. We determined that virus yield in AdYB-1-infected cells was about 2 orders of magnitude lower than in Ad5-infected cells (Fig.8 C). These differences in virus yield are most likely because the E1-minus AdYB-1 adenovirus vector does not contain E1B-55kDa protein and does not express E4 (data not shown), which is induced by E1A (26Nevins J.R. Cell. 1981; 26: 213-220Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). Proteins encoded by the E4 region and E1B-55kDa affect viral replication, viral and cellular RNA transport, and particle formation (44Halbert D.N. Cutt J.R. Shenk T. J. Virol. 1985; 56: 250-257Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 60Weinberg D.H. Ketner G. J. Virol. 1986; 57: 833-838Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 61Medghalchi S. Padmanabhan R. Ketner G. Virology. 1997; 236: 8-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 62Goodrum F.D. Ornelles D.A. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 7474-7488Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).E1B-55kDa mutant adenovirus vectors can function as oncolytic viruses in cancer therapy in cases where the host cell p53 gene is mutated or otherwise inactivated (50Bischoff J.R. Kim D.H. Williams A. Heise C. Horn C. Muna M. Ng L. Nye J.A. Sampson-Johannes A. Fattaey A. McCormick F. Science. 1996; 274: 373-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (1558) Google Scholar), and it was shown that these viruses do not replicate in normal tissues that express wild type p53 (63Heise C. Sampson J.A. Williams A. McCormick F. Von H.D. Kirn D.H. Nat. Med. 1997; 3: 639-645Crossref PubMed Scopus (827) Google Scholar). Moreover E1B-55kDa mutant adenoviruses replicate less efficiently than a wild type adenovirus. Our results provide an explanation to these findings. We think that E1B-55kDa mutant adenoviruses replicate poorly because of a failure to induce nuclear accumulation of YB-1 in vivo. The results with AdYB-1 demonstrate this convincingly. In AdYB-1-infected cells YB-1 accumulated in the nuclei, and this was associated with E1-independent AdYB-1 replication. We also have created a breast epithelial cell line with constitutive nuclear overexpression of YB-1 and demonstrated efficient replication of E1-minus adenovirus vectors in these cells.2 The role of YB-1 in adenovirus replication is further strongly supported by our finding that the E1-minus adenovirus vector replicated efficiently in several multidrug-resistant cell lines in which YB-1 is located in the nucleus.2 These results are in line with a recent report by Ganly et al. (64Ganly I. Kim Y.T. Hann B. Balmain A. Brown R. Gene Therapy. 2001; 8: 369-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), who showed that an E1B-55kDa-deleted adenovirus (ONYX-015) replicates with higher efficacy in cisplatin-resistant cell lines.Deregulated nuclear YB-1 expression occurs in certain human malignant diseases such as breast cancer (15Bargou R.C.

Metzner S. Bommert K. Mapara M.Y. Winzer K.J. Dietel M. Dörken B. Royer H.D. Nat. Med. 1997; 3: 447-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar, 69Koike K. Uschiumi T. Ohga T. Toh S. Wada M.

Chem. 2001; 276: 28562-28569Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar) cause nuclear accumulation of YB-1. In conclusion, we have identified YB-1 as an E1B-55kDa-dependent cellular factor that controls E2 late promoter activity and in consequence viral DNA replication at later stages of infection. Thus, our findings are fundamental for adenovirus biology and form a basis for the development of tumor selective adenovirus vectors for cancer gene therapy. Adenoviruses have developed efficient strategies to force infected cells into the S phase of the cell cycle (1Boulanger P.A. Blair G.E. Biochem. J. 1991; 275: 281-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). This process involves the adenoviral E1A and E1B proteins, which are the first viral proteins to be expressed after infection, and both are essential for viral replication (2Jones N. Shenk T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 3665-3669Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar, 3Berk A.J. Lee F. Harrison T. Williams J. Sharp P. Cell. 1979; 17: 935-944Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). Replication of adenovirus DNA depends directly on interactions between the host cell replication factors NFI, NFII, and NFIII (4De Jong R.N. van der Vliet P.C. Gene (Amst.). 1999; 5: 1-12Crossref Scopus (66) Google Scholar) and the three viral replication proteins encoded by the E2 region. The adenovirus E2 transcription unit consists of the E2A and E2B genes, which encode precursor terminal protein pTP, DNA polymerase, and DBP, a multifunctional DNA-binding protein (5van der Vliet P.C. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1995; 199: 1-30PubMed Google Scholar). E2 gene expression is driven from two promoters. At early times of infection, E2 gene transcription is under control of the E2 early promoter. At intermediate stages of infection, E2 gene expression is controlled by the E2 late promoter (6Swaminathan S. Thimmapaya B. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1995; 199: 177-194PubMed Google Scholar). E2 early promoter activity is regulated by adenovirus E1A protein, which controls the activity of the E2F transcription factor by targeting the tumor suppressor protein pRB (7Kovesdi I. Reichel R. Nevins J.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 2180-2184Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 8Whyte P. Buchkovish K.J. Horowitz J.M. Friend S.H. Raybuck M. Weinberg R.A. Harlow E. Nature. 1988; 334: 124-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (1033) Google Scholar). In contrast, activity of the E2 late promoter is repressed by E1A (9Guilfoyle R.A. Osheroff W.P. Rossini M. EMBO J. 1985; 4: 707-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The E2 late promoter is characterized by the presence of a TATA box, two SP1 recognition sites, and three CCAAT boxes. Two of the inverted CCAAT boxes are located at positions −72 and −135 relative to the E2 late cap site in a 157-bp sequence of the of the E2 late promoter, which is sufficient for efficient E2 gene transcription (10Bhat G. SivaRaman L. Murthy S. Dohmer P. Thimmappaya B. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 2045-2052Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar,11Goding C.R. Temperley S.M. Fisher F. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 7761-7780Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Inverted CCAAT boxes have been identified as sites for Y box proteins, which are highly conserved through evolution from prokaryotes to eukaryotes, and they can function as transcriptional, translational, and developmental regulators (12Ladomery M. Sommerville J. BioEssays. 1995; 17: 9-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 13Wolffe A.P. BioEssays. 1994; 16: 245-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar, 14Wolffe A.P. Trends Cell Biol. 1998; 8: 318-323Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). In eukaryotes, increased expression of Y box proteins in somatic cells is associated with drug resistance and a malignant phenotype (15Bargou R.C. Jürchott K. Wagener C. Bergmann S. Metzner S. Bommert K. Mapara M.Y. Winzer K.J. Dietel M. Dörken B. Royer H.D. Nat. Med. 1997; 3: 447-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar), and it was discussed that Y box proteins are involved in activating certain genes that are expressed in the S phase of the cell cycle (16Swamynathan S.K. Nambiar A. Guntaka R.V. FASEB J. 1998; 12: 515-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Recently, it has been reported that a major protein in messenger ribonucleoprotein particles in somatic cells is a member of the Y box-binding transcription factor family that acts either as a repressor or an activator of protein synthesis (17Evdokimova V.M. Ovchinnikov L.P. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1999; 31: 139-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). YB-1 is also involved in regulating mRNA stability (18Chen C.Y. Gherzi R. Andersen J.S. Gaietta G. Jürchott K. Royer H.D. Mann M. Karin M. Genes Dev. 2000; 15: 1236-1248Google Scholar). In addition, it has been shown that YB-1 interacts with p53 (19Okamoto T. Izumi H. Imamura T. Takano H. Ise T. Uchiumi T. Kuwano M. Kohno K. Oncogene. 2000; 14: 6194-6202Crossref Scopus (134) Google Scholar), represses fas gene expression (20Lasham A. Lindridge E. Rudert F. Onrust R. Watson J. Gene (Amst.). 2000; 11: 1-13Crossref Scopus (113) Google Scholar), and promotes splicing of the adenoviral E1A pre-mRNA (21Chansky H.A. Hu M. Hickstein D.D. Yang L. Cancer Res. 2001; 6: 3586-3590Google Scholar). This suggests that YB-1 plays a significant role in the coordinated control of transcription, splicing, and translation in mammalian cells. Furthermore, Y box proteins are important host cell factors for several animal and human viruses. For example, it was shown that a Y box protein interacts specifically with the long terminal repeat of Rous sarcoma virus (22Faber M. Seally L. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 22243-22254Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, YB-1 is a transcriptional regulator of human polyomavirus JC (23Safak M. Gallia G.L. Ansari S.A. Khalili K. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 10146-10157Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (24Ansari S.A. Safak M. Gallia G.L. Sawaya B.E. Amini S Khalili K. J. Gen. Virol. 1999; 80: 2629-2638Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Here we report a novel function of E1B-55kDa in adenovirus replication. We show that E1B-55kDa facilitates nuclear accumulation of YB-1, which is associated with an induction of E2 gene transcription. We demonstrate a specific interaction of YB-1 with the promoter proximal Y box of the E2 late promoter and show that YB-1 controls E2 late promoter activity. Our data reveal that the viral E1B-55kDa protein and the host cell factor YB-1 act jointly to control E2 gene expression at later stages of infection.

Because Q synthesis machinery in Saccharomyces cerevisiae is located in the mitochondria, the intracellular distribution of Q indicates the existence of intracellular Q transport. In this study, the uptake of exogenous Q6 by yeast and its transport from the plasma membrane to mitochondria was assessed in both wild-type and in Q-less coq7 mutants derived from four distinct laboratory yeast strains. Q6 supplementation of medium containing ethanol, a non-fermentable carbon source, rescued growth in only two of the four coq7 mutant strains. Following culture in medium containing dextrose, the added Q6 was detected in the plasma membrane of each of four coq7 mutants tested. This detection of Q6 in the plasma membrane was corroborated by measuring ascorbate stabilization activity, as catalyzed by NADH-ascorbate free radical reductase, a transmembrane redox activity that provides a functional assay of plasma membrane Q6. These assays indicate that each of the four coq7 mutant strains assimilate exogenous Q6 into the plasma membrane. The two coq7 mutant strains rescued by Q6 supplementation for growth on ethanol contained mitochondrial Q6 levels similar to wild type. However, the content of Q6 in mitochondria from the non-rescued strains was only 35 and 8%, respectively, of that present in the corresponding wild-type parental strains. In yeast strains rescued by exogenous Q6, succinate-cytochrome creductase activity was partially restored, whereas non-rescued strains contained very low levels of activity. There was a strong correlation between mitochondrial Q6 content, succinate-cytochrome c reductase activity, and steady state levels of the cytochrome c1 polypeptide. These studies show that transport of extracellular Q6 to the mitochondria operates in yeast but is strain-dependent. When Q biosynthesis is disrupted in yeast strains with defects in the intracellular transport of exogenous Q, the bc1complex is unstable. These results indicate that delivery of exogenous Q6 to mitochondria is required fore activity and stability of the bc1 complex in yeast coqmutants.

Coenzyme Q (ubiquinone or Q) is a lipophilic molecule bearing a fully substituted benzoquinone ring and a hydrophobic poly-isoprenoid tail that partitions the molecule to the membrane lipids. Q cycles between two different states, the oxidized ubiquinone state (Q) and the reduced ubiquinol state (QH2). In eukaryotes Q is required for mitochondrial electron transport where it acts as an electron shuttle from complex I (NADH dehydrogenase) or complex II (succinate dehydrogenase) to complex III (1.Dutton P.L. Ohnishi T. Darrouzet E. Leonard M.A. Sharp R.E. Gibney B.R. Daldal F. Moser C.C. Kagan V.E. Quinn P.J. Coenzyme Q: Molecular Mechanisms in Health and Disease. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL2000: 65-82Google Scholar). Other mitochondrial functions of Q have recently been elucidated, including its involvement as an essential cofactor in the proton pumping activity of uncoupling proteins (2.Echtay K.S. Winkler E. Klingenberg M. Nature. 2000; 408: 609-613Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar) and its action as an inhibitor of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore, which is involved in the initiation of apoptosis (3.Walter L.

Q is involved in respiratory electron transport in prokaryotic cells where it also serves as an acceptor of electrons in the introduction of disulfide bonds in periplasmic proteins (4.Bader M.W. Xie T. Yu C.A. Bardwell J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26082-26088Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Recently, the oxidation state of Q (Q/QH2 ratio) has been shown to be the signal that sets metabolism toward either fermentation or respiration, as sensed by the ArcB/ArcA two-component signal transduction system in Escherichia coli (5.Georgellis D. Kwon O. Lin E.C. Science. 2001; 292: 2314-2316Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar). In eukaryotic cells Q is present in a wide variety of other endomembranes (6.Kalen A. Norling B. Appelkvist E.L. Dallner G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 926: 70-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar), including Golgi and endoplasmic reticulum, where it functions as a chain-terminating antioxidant and also as a secondary co-antioxidant through the reduction of the α-tocopheryl radical to α-tocopherol (7.Kagan V.E. Nohl H. Quinn P.J. Cadenas E. Packer L. Handbook of Antioxidants. 1. Marcel Decker Inc., New York1996: 157-201Google Scholar). The redox chemistry of Q also plays a role in the electron transport chain present in the lysosomal membrane (8.Gille L. Nohl H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2000; 375: 347-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) and in the plasma membrane electron transport system of Saccharomyces cerevisiae (9.Santos-Ocaña C. Villalba J.M. Córdoba F.

Lindgren A. Löw H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 11126-11130Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). The subcellular location of Q biosynthesis is a topic currently under investigation. Studies carried out in mammalian cells (6.Kalen A. Norling B. Appelkvist E.L. Dallner G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 926: 70-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar) suggest that Q synthesis is located not only in the mitochondria but also in the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus. It was proposed that the high level of Q synthesis in Golgi apparatus serves as a reservoir for its subsequent distribution among membranes. However, studies in yeast indicate that synthesis of Q occurs on the matrix side of the mitochondrial inner membrane, as shown by the submitochondrial localization of several Coq polypeptides required for Q biosynthesis, including Coq2p, Coq3p, Coq4p, Coq5p, Coq7p, and Abc1p (11.Jonassen T.

This localization supports early biochemical studies identifying a mitochondrial site for Q biosynthesis within rat liver (26.Houser R.M Olson R.E. J. Biol.

The fact that Q is distributed differentially among intracellular membranes indicates the existence of a mechanism for delivery of Q from its site of mitochondrial biosynthesis to other cellular membranes. Evidence for Q uptake and transport to the mitochondria is provided by experiments with yeast coq mutants where growth on a non-fermentable carbon source is rescued by the addition of Q6 to the medium (11.Jonassen T.

This transport mechanism may participate in the normal distribution of Q among membranes, including Q uptake by cells that either do not produce or produce low levels of Q and the mobilization of Q in response to metabolic changes or stress situations that require the redox functions of Q. Several studies provide support for Q mobilization within the cell. HL-60 cells treated with ethidium bromide (resulting in a loss of mitochondrial DNA) and respiratory deficient yeast mutants contain increased amounts of CoQ at the plasma membrane (29.Gómez-Dı́az C.

The use of Q10 in these clinical settings would benefit from a better understanding of its mode of transport to organs and tissues and of the mechanisms responsible for Q uptake by cells and intracellular transport among cell membranes. Although phospholipid intracellular transport has been widely studied in S. cerevisiae (37.Daum G. Lees N.D. Bard M. Dickson R.

Bankaitis V.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1404: 85-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), the transport of Q6 has not been addressed. The aim of this study is to characterize the distribution of Q in the plasma membrane and mitochondria in yeast coq mutant strains with defects in Q6 biosynthesis. The culture of coq mutant strains in YPD (dextrose-containing) medium supplemented with Q6 provides an assay for the ability of exogenous Q6 to restore Q-dependent functions within distinct cell compartments, such as Q-dependent redox activities in the plasma membrane and succinate-cytochrome c reductase activity in the mitochondria. The data show that intracellular transport of Q6 is dependent on the genetic background of the yeast strain and that in the Q-less yeast the delivery of exogenous Q6 to mitochondria appears to be required to stabilize the cytochrome c1polypeptide and to maintain a productive complex III. The yeast strains used in this study are described in Table I. Yeast were grown in rich YPD medium (1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, and 2% dextrose) and in YPE (1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, and 2% ethanol) when growth rescue experiments were performed. Defined media contained 0.18% yeast nitrogen base without amino acids, 2% dextrose, 0.14% NaH2PO4, 0.5% (NH4)2SO4, and either a complete amino acid supplement (SDC) or the amino acid supplement minus one or more components (SD selective) (40.Barkovich R.J.

Cultures used in all experiments were tested to ascertain rho status. Aliquots of cultures were diluted and plated on YPD. After 4 days at 30 °C, 20 colonies were randomly selected and mated with a ρ0 tester strain (JM6 or JM8). Diploids were selected by transferring the cells to SD selective medium with glucose and respiratory competence assessed by transfer to YPG plates (glycerol). Subcellular fractionation experiments were completed and analyzed only after verifying that 100% of the colonies tested showed growth on the glycerol plate medium.

Methods Enzymol. 1988; 157: 533-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). This procedure requires two separate sucrose gradient separations and an alkaline protein extraction to remove extrinsic proteins and to open plasma membrane vesicles to release vesicles derived from other endomembranes. This method produces a low yield of plasma membrane but with a concomitant high purity. In brief, yeast cells were lysed by vortexing with glass beads and centrifuged (10 min at 700 × g) to remove debris. The supernatant was centrifuged (30 min at 20,000 ×g) to obtain a crude membrane pellet. Crude membranes were resuspended in sucrose buffer (20% w/w sucrose, 10 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.6, 1 mm EDTA, and 1 mmdithiothreitol) and applied to a sucrose step gradient of 4 ml (43%) (w/w) sucrose and 2 ml (53%) (w/w) sucrose in the same buffer. After centrifugation (4 h at 100,000 × g), plasma membranes were recovered at the 43/53 interphase and reapplied to a second sucrose step gradient as before. To remove non-intrinsic plasma membrane proteins, the samples were treated with 100 mmNa2CO3, pH 11.5 (42.Fujiki Y. Hubbard A.L. Fowler S. Lazarow P.B. J. Cell Biol. 1982; 93: 97-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (1385) Google Scholar), and suspended in the same buffer with 0.33 m sucrose. Yeast spheroplasts and subcellular fractions enriched in mitochondria were isolated by published procedures (43.Glick B.S. Pon L.A. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 260: 213-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). Mitochondria were purified using a Nycodenz gradient. Crude mitochondria were suspended in buffer A (0.6 m sorbitol, 5 mm K+MES, pH 6.0), layered on top of a discontinuous step Nycodenz gradient (5 ml (20%) and 5 ml (14.5%) in buffer A), and subjected to 1 h of centrifugation at 100,000 × g. Purified mitochondria were harvested from the interface, diluted 3-fold with buffer A, and centrifuged for 10 min at 12,000 × g. The pellet of purified mitochondria was washed once with buffer B (0.6m mannitol, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4) and suspended in a small volume of buffer B. The protein concentrations of plasma membrane and mitochondrial fractions were assayed by the bicinchoninic acid assay. Equal amounts of protein (25 μg) from both fractions were analyzed by electrophoresis on 12.5% Tris-glycine gels and subsequently transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. The incubation with the antibodies and the subsequent washes were performed with 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 5% skimmed milk, and 0.05% Tween 20. The primary antibodies were used at the following dilutions: 1:2,000 Pma1; 1:500–5,000 Sec62p; 1:10,000 porin; 1:5,000 OM45; 1:10,000 α-KDH, and 1:10,000 cytochrome c1. Horseradish peroxidase-linked secondary antibodies to rabbit and mouse IgG were used in a 1:10,000 dilution. Blots were washed free of all antibodies by incubating the nitrocellulose membranes 30 min at 55 °C in 60 mmTris-HCl (pH 6.8), 2% SDS, and 0.7% β-mercaptoethanol. Densitometry analysis was performed with the Alphaimager 3.3 software from Alpha Innotech (San Leandro, CA). Q9 (10 μl of a 2 mmstock) was added as an internal standard to aliquots of plasma membrane and mitochondria (500 μl, 0.5–1 mg of protein), and samples were incubated 20 min at room temperature. The samples were mixed with an equal volume of 2% SDS and vortexed 1 min. Two milliliters of 5% isopropyl alcohol in ethanol was added, and samples were vortexed again for 1 min. To recover CoQ, 5 ml of hexane were added, and the mixture was vortexed at top speed for 1 min and centrifuged at 1000 × g for 5 min. The upper phases recovered from three extractions were pooled and dried in a rotatory evaporator. Lipid extracts were suspended in 1 ml of 9:1 methanol/ethanol, dried in a speed-vac and kept at −20 °C. Samples were suspended in a suitable volume of 9:1 methanol/ethanol prior to HPLC injection. Q6 and Q9 were separated by reversed-phase high pressure liquid chromatography with a C18 column (Alltech Econosphere 5-μm, 4.6 × 250-mm column) and quantified with an ESA Coulochem II electrochemical detector and a 5010 analytical cell (E1, −450 mV; E2, 500 mV). A separate precolumn cell (ESA 5020) was set to an oxidizing mode (E, +450 mV) to convert all hydroquinones to quinones. The mobile phase was adjusted to a flow rate of 1 ml/min and was composed of methanol/ethanol/2-propanol (88/24/10) and 13.4 mm lithium perchlorate. Q6 and Q9were quantified from the electrochemical detector results with Q6 and Q9 as external standards. The use of Q9 as an internal standard indicated a recovery of 90–100% of total Q9 added to samples. The ascorbate stabilization assay was described previously (30.Santos-Ocaña C. Córdoba F. Crane F.L. Clarke C.F. Navas P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8099-8105Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Yeast cultures were harvested at mid-log phase (OD600 nm = 4) and washed twice in cold water. Cells were resuspended at 107 cells/ml in 0.1m Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.4) with 0.06 mmCuSO4. Ascorbate oxidation was followed by the direct reading of absorbance at 265 nm, with an extinction coefficient E265 nmM is 14.5 mm−1 cm−1 at pH 7.4 (44.Buettner G.R. J. Biochem. Biophys. Methods. 1988; 16: 27-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar). The addition of ascorbate (final concentration, 0.15 mm) to the cell suspension initiated the ascorbate oxidation caused by the presence of Cu2+. Cells were removed by centrifugation, and the supernatants were used to measure the ascorbate oxidation rates. Ascorbate stabilization is defined as the difference between the oxidation rate of ascorbate in the presence of cells and the oxidation rate without cells. Yeast cells were grown at 30 °C overnight in 10 ml of YPD with shaking at 200 rpm and were used to inoculate 200 ml of YPD to a density of 0.25 OD660 nm/ml. The cultures were incubated at 30 °C as before until cell density was 9–10 OD660 nm/ml, and then the cultures were divided in two flasks, one receiving 100 μl of 2 mm CoQ6 in ethanol and the other 100 μl of ethanol alone. Both cultures were incubated at 30 °C, 200 rpm for 48 h. Crude mitochondrial fractions were prepared as indicated above and were assayed directly without freezing. Succinate-cytochrome c reductase activity was measured in 40 mmsodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) containing 20 μm sodium succinate and 250 μm potassium cyanide. Samples of mitochondria (50 μg of protein) were incubated in the assay buffer without cytochrome c for 5 min. The reaction was initiated by the cytochrome c addition and was monitored at 550 nm minus 540 nm. The specific activity was determined with an E550M of 18,500m−1 cm−1 (45.Trumpower B.L. Edwards C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 8697-8706Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For assays in the presence of exogenous Q6 the assay buffer contained 10 μm Q6 or 1% ethanol. Cytochrome c oxidase activity was measured in 40 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) containing 25 μm reduced cytochrome c (45.Trumpower B.L. Edwards C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 8697-8706Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Horse heart cytochrome c was reduced with l-ascorbate until ratio A550/A565 was between 6 and 9. The reaction was started with the addition of 15–25 μg of mitochondrial samples, and the cytochrome coxidation was monitored measuring the decrease of A550 using an Aminco DB-3500 spectrophotometer. The specific activity was determined using an E550M of 18,500m−1 cm−1. Previous studies have shown that yeast coq3 and coq7 mutants with defects in Q biosynthesis are rescued for growth on non-fermentable carbon sources (such as ethanol) by the addition of exogenous Q6 (11.Jonassen T.

Jonassen T. Lee P.T. Clarke C.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 18161-18168Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). To test the generality of this rescue in coq7 mutants, four null coq7 mutants from distinct wild-type genetic backgrounds (W303.1B, CEN.PK2–1C, EG103, and FY250) were used (Table I). The strains were incubated in growth medium containing ethanol (YPE) in the presence or absence of 15 μm exogenous Q6 for 7 days. Growth was monitored by measuring the OD at 600 nm, and aliquots of cultures were transferred to YPD plate medium to verify the absence of contamination. In the absence of Q6supplementation the coq7 mutants were unable to grow on YPE medium (Fig. 1A). The addition of Q6 to YPE medium rescued the growth of CEN.MP3–1A and W303ΔCOQ7 strains (Fig. 1B). Growth was slower than in wild-type strains, although after 4 days the cultures reached a density similar to the parental strains. However, FY250 coq7 and EG103 coq7 strains showed no growth in the Q6-supplemented YPE medium after 7 days of culture. This lack of rescue by exogenous Q6 indicates a defect either in Q6 uptake or in a hypothetical Q6 transport system. The ability of CEN.MP3–1A and W303ΔCOQ7 yeast strains to grow with a non-fermentable carbon source in the presence of exogenous Q6 indicated that exogenous Q6 is transported to the mitochondria. The first barrier to a possible Q6 transport pathway is likely to be the plasma membrane; thus, insertion of Q6 into the cell plasma membrane may be a critical first step of Q6 uptake. To analyze this process we quantified the amounts of Q6 present in the plasma membrane and mitochondria of the eight strains (four wild-type and four coq7 mutants) cultured with or without exogenous Q6. YPD culture medium was used to allow for growth of the FY250 coq7 and EG103 coq7 mutant strains. Yeast were harvested at a cell density of OD660 nm = 10–14 representing post-diauxic shift in wild-type cells and increased reliance on the use of Q6 in respiratory energy metabolism. Yeast plasma membrane fractions were purified as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The quality of the plasma membrane samples was tested with several antibodies against endomembrane marker proteins that can co-purify with plasma membrane (Fig. 2A). Purified plasma membrane was compared with the starting materia"
https://openalex.org/W2050293304,"Ras-related proteins are small GTPases that are post-translationally modified with mevalonate-derived isoprenoids. Although the effects of inhibition of isoprenylation on protein function have been examined, the consequences of depletion of isoprenoid pools on regulation of expression of isoprenylated proteins have yet to be investigated. In these studies we have shown that depletion of mevalonate results in increased total levels of Ras, Rap1a, RhoA, and RhoB in K562 cells. Cycloheximide and [35S]methionine pulse/pulse-chase experiments reveal that mevalonate depletion increases the de novosynthesis of Ras and RhoA and decreases the degradation of existing Ras and RhoA protein. Pretreatment with actinomycin D completely prevents the induced up-regulation of RhoB and only partially prevents the up-regulation of Ras, Rap1a, and RhoA. Although depletion of mevalonate does not alter steady state levels of Ras mRNA, there is an increase in RhoB mRNA. Our results are the first to demonstrate that mevalonate depletion induces up-regulation of Ras and Ras-related proteins by discrete mechanisms that include modulation of transcriptional, translational, and post-translational processes."

In this study, we identified and characterized a new homologue of p125, KIAA0725p. KIAA0725p exhibited remarkable sequence similarity with p125 throughout the entire sequence determined but lacked an N-terminal proline-rich, Sec23p-interacting region. In vitro binding analysis showed that KIAA0725p does not bind to Sec23p. KIAA0725p possessed phospholipase A1 activity preferentially for phosphatidic acid. We examined the effects of overexpression of KIAA0725p on the morphology of organelles. Overexpression of KIAA0725p, like that of p125, caused dispersion of the endoplasmic reticulum-Golgi intermediate compartment and Golgi apparatus.

Recent elegant studies demonstrated that the conversion of lyso-PA, an inverted cone-shaped lipid, to PA, a cone-shaped lipid, induces fission of vesicles from the plasma membrane (15.Schmidt A.

In addition to this structural contribution, PA may play a regulatory role by interacting with proteins involved in vesicular transport processes. It binds to ADP-ribosylation factor, N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor, and kinesin (17.Manifava M. Thuring J.W.J.F. Lim Z.Y. Packman L. Holmes A.B. Ktistakis N.T. J. Biol.

Thus, the analysis of PA metabolism may provide insight into the mechanisms underlying vesicle-mediated transport and Golgi organization.We previously identified p125 as a protein that interacts with mammalian Sec23p via its N-terminal proline-rich region (18.Tani K.

Nagahama M. Hauri H.-P. Tagaya M. Tani K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 279: 144-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Sec23p is a component of the COPII coat that functions in the production of vesicles from the ER (20.Barlowe C. Orci L. Yeung T. Hosobuchi M. Hamamoto S. Salama N. Rexach M.F. Ravazzola M. Amherdt M. Schekman R. Cell. 1994; 77: 895-907Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1033) Google Scholar). p125 is localized in the ERGIC and/or cis-Golgi, and its overexpression causes the dispersion of these membrane compartments, suggesting its involvement in the early secretory pathway (18.Tani K. Mizoguchi T. Iwamatsu A. Hatsuzawa K. Tagaya M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20505-20512Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the central and C-terminal regions of p125 exhibit significant sequence homology with PA-PLA1. PA-PLA1 preferentially cleaves PA and is predominantly expressed in testis (21.Higgs H.N. Han M.H. Johnson G.E. Glomset J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5468-5477Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar).In the present study, we searched data bases using the amino acid sequence of p125 and identified a homologous protein that is encoded by human expressed sequence tag clone KIAA0725. This protein exhibits PLA1 activity preferentially for PA. Consistent with the fact that KIAA0725p does not possess an N-terminal proline-rich region, it does not bind to Sec23p. Overexpression of KIAA0725p affects the morphology of various organelles including the ER.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDUREScDNA Cloning of KIAA0725pThe KIAA0725 clone was obtained from the Kazusa DNA Research Institute, Japan. To amplify the region upstream of KIAA0725, 5′-RACE was carried out using a MarathonTM cDNA amplification kit (CLONTECH) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Marathon-ReadyTM cDNA from human placenta and a synthetic oligonucleotide (5′-CCTGCTCCATGGGTGTTGAACCCCA) were used as the template and antisense primer for PCR, respectively. The antisense primer was complementary to nucleotides 128–152 of the reported KIAA0725 sequence.To obtain the full-length cDNA of KIAA0725p, a DNA fragment comprising from the putative initiation codon to the SalI site of KIAA0725 was amplified by PCR, and the resultant fragment was replaced with the DNA fragment comprising from the 5′-end to the SalI site of the KIAA0725 clone.Northern Blot AnalysisThe cDNA fragment (the AflII-FbaI fragment) corresponding to amino acid residues 586–706 of KIAA0725p was used as a probe. Human multiple tissues blots of poly(A)+ RNA (CLONTECH) were incubated with the32P-labeled probe in an ExpressHyb hybridization solution (CLONTECH) overnight at 68 °C. The blots were washed for 40 min in 2× SSC containing 0.05% SDS at room temperature and then for 40 min in 0.1× SSC containing 0.1% SDS at 50 °C. Radioactivity was detected with a Fuji Bioimage analyzer BAS2000.AntibodiesThe full-length KIAA0725p with the N-terminal histidine tag was expressed in Escherichia coli cells using expression vector pQE30 (Qiagen). Since the expressed protein was located in insoluble inclusion bodies, it was isolated as follows. E. coli cells expressing the histidine-tagged KIAA0725p were suspended in phosphate-buffered saline containing protease inhibitors and then passed through a French pressure cell (Aminco, SLM Instruments Inc.) three times at 8,000 p.s.i. The resulting suspension was centrifuged at 27,000 × g for 10 min, and the insoluble fraction obtained was subjected to SDS-PAGE. After staining with 0.05% Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250, the portion of the gel corresponding to the histidine-tagged KIAA0725p band was excised. The gel fragment was homogenized in phosphate-buffered saline with a Teflon homogenizer and then directly injected into rabbits. The antibody was affinity-purified by using the antigen immobilized on nitrocellulose filters.The monoclonal anti-ERGIC53 antibody was a generous gift from Dr. H.-P. Hauri of the University of Basel. The polyclonal anti-β-COP antibody was prepared in this laboratory. The anti-FLAG antibody and anti-GST antibody were obtained from Sigma and Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA), respectively.Cell CultureVero cells and 293T cells (22.Tanaka M. Gupta R. Mayer B.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6829-6837Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar) were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 50 IU/ml penicillin, 50 μg/ml streptomycin, and 10% fetal calf serum.Plasmid Construction, Transfection, and in Vitro Binding AssayMammalian expression plasmid pFLAG-CMV-2 (Eastman Kodak Co.) was used to express proteins fused with the N-terminal FLAG epitope. The cDNA fragment encoding full-length KIAA0725p was inserted into pFLAG-CMV-2. Mammalian expression plasmids for GST-Sec23p and FLAG-tagged p125 were prepared as described previously (18.Tani K.

Chem. 1999; 274: 20505-20512Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar).For the expression of fusion proteins, 293T cells plated on 35-mm dishes were transfected with 1–2 μg of expression plasmids using the LipofectAMINE PLUS reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. At 24 h after transfection, the cells were lysed in lysis buffer (0.35 ml/dish) consisting of 25 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.2, 1% Triton X-100, 150 mmKCl, 0.5 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 μm pepstatin, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 2 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 mm dithiothreitol. The lysate was clarified by centrifugation for 10 min at 17,000 × g. The supernatant was used for the in vitro binding assay as described previously (18.Tani K. Mizoguchi T. Iwamatsu A. Hatsuzawa K. Tagaya M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20505-20512Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar).Site-directed MutagenesisThe PstI fragment encoding amino acid residues 286–470 of KIAA0725p was isolated from pFLAG-CMV-2 carrying KIAA0725p cDNA and then inserted into the PstI site of pKF19k DNA (TaKaRa). Oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis was carried out using Mutan-Super Express Km (TaKaRa) according to the manufacturer's instructions. For the replacement of Ser351 with alanine, a synthetic oligonucleotide, 5′-TGCGGTCATGCTTTAGGTTCG, was used. The replacement was confirmed by DNA sequencing. The PstI fragment carrying the mutation was replaced with the corresponding fragment of pFLAG-CMV-2 carrying KIAA0725p cDNA.Preparation of 14C-Labeled Substrates1-[1-14C]Palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-PC was prepared from 1-[1-14C]palmitoyl-lyso-PC as described previously (23.Arai H. Inoue K. Natori Y. Banno Y. Nozawa Y. Nojima S. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1985; 97: 1525-1532Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) with a slight modification. A solution comprising 0.18 μmol of 1-[1-14C]palmitoyl-lyso-PC (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and 0.27 μmol of oleic acid was dried by evaporation, and then the residual materials were suspended in 100 mmpotassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4. To this suspension were added 5 μmol of ATP, 5 μmol of MgCl2, 0.15 μmol of coenzyme A, and 100 μg of bovine liver microsomal proteins. The total reaction volume was 480 μl. After a 1-h incubation at 37 °C with shaking, lipids were extracted from the reaction mixture twice by the method of Bligh and Dyer (24.Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (42136) Google Scholar). The extract was spotted in a line onto a preparative thin layer chromatography plate, and then the plate was developed in 50:30:8:4 (v/v) chloroform/methanol/acetic acid/water. The14C-labeled PC band was scraped off from the plate, and 14C-labeled PC was extracted from the silica gels.1-[1-14C]Palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-PA, 1-[1-14C]palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-PS, and 1-[1-14C]palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-PE were prepared by transphosphatidylation catalyzed by Actinomaduraphospholipase D as described previously (25.Comfurius P. Zwaal R.F.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1977; 488: 36-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar, 26.Horigome K. Hayakawa M. Inoue K. Nojima S. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1987; 101: 53-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). For the preparation of PS or PA, 14C-labeled PC was suspended in 500 μl of diethylether, and then 500 μl of a solution comprising 100 mm sodium acetate, pH 5.5, 100 mmCaCl2, and 5 ml-Ser was added. The reaction was started by the addition of 2.5 units of Actinomadura phospholipase D (Meito Sangyo, Tokyo, Japan), and 2.5 units of phospholipase D was added every 15 min. After 1 h at 45 °C with vigorous stirring, the products were extracted twice by the method of Bligh and Dyer (24.Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (42136) Google Scholar). 14C-Labeled PS and PA were separated by thin layer chromatography in 65:25:8.9:1.1 (v/v/v/v) chloroform, methanol, formic acid, water. For the preparation of PE and PA, 14C-labeled PC was treated as described above except that the reaction mixture comprised 100 mm sodium acetate, pH 5.5, 100 mm CaCl2, and 200 mmethanolamine. 14C-Labeled PE and PA were separated by thin layer chromatography in 50:40:3:7 (v/v/v/v) chloroform, methanol, 25% ammonia, water.Preparation of Cell Lysates for the Phospholipase Activity Assay293T cells plated on 60-mm dishes were transfected with 3 μg of expression plasmids using the LipofectAMINE PLUS reagent. At 24 h after transfection, the cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, and then lysis buffer (200 μl) consisting of 25 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.2, 250 mm sucrose, 0.5 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 μm pepstatin, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 2 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 mm dithiothreitol was added to the plate. The cells were scraped off with a cell scraper, and the resulting suspension was collected. This procedure was repeated again, and the two suspensions were pooled. The cells were homogenized with 10 strokes in a stainless steel homogenizer. The homogenate was centrifuged at 1,000 ×g for 5 min to obtain a supernatant. The protein concentration was determined using the BCA protein assay reagent (Pierce). The final protein concentration of the samples was adjusted to 3 mg/ml with lysis buffer, and then the samples were used for the phospholipase A assay.Phospholipase A AssayPhospholipase A activity was measured as described previously (27.Nagai Y. Aoki J. Sato T. Amano K. Matsuda Y. Arai H. Inoue K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11053-11059Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 28.Dole V.P. Meinertz H. J. Biol. Chem. 1960; 235: 2595-2599Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). 14C-Labeled phospholipid was dried and suspended in water at a concentration of 200 μm. The assay was started by the addition of 50 μl of a lipid solution to 200 μl of assay buffer. The assay mixture comprised 40 μm phospholipid (2,000–10,000 cpm) and cell lysate (120 μg as protein) in 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and 1 mm EDTA (PA as substrate) or in 100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) and 4 mm CaCl2 (PS, PC, or PE as substrate). In some experiments, 330 μm Triton X-100 was included in the assay mixture. After 1 h at 37 °C, the reaction was stopped by the addition of 1.25 ml of Dole's reagent (78:20:2 (v/v/v) 2-propanol, n-heptane, 1 nH2SO4). The liberated fatty acid was extracted, and its radioactivity was measured with a scintillation counter.Lipase (Triacylglycerol Lipase) AssayLipase activity was measured by the method of Groener and Knauer (29.Groener J.E.M. Knauer T.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1981; 665: 306-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) with a slight modification. Briefly, 250 nmol of 14C-labeled triolein (trioleoyl glycerol) was dried under a gentle stream of nitrogen and then suspended with a probe-type sonicator in 100 μl of water containing 0.25 mg of gum arabic. The reaction was started by the addition of this solution to assay buffer containing an appropriate amount of enzyme. The assay mixture (250 μl) comprised 100 mm Tris-maleate, pH 8.5, 1% bovine serum albumin, and 1 mm triolein. The reaction was performed at 37 °C for 1 h and stopped by the addition of 1 ml of a solution (37:18:44 (v/v/v) benzene, chloroform, methanol) containing 0.1 mmoleic acid, followed by the addition of 125 μl of 0.6 nNaOH. The mixture was then vortexed vigorously for 4–5 min, and briefly centrifuged. The resulting upper phase was taken for the determination of released 14C-oleic acid with a scintillation counter.Immunofluorescence MicroscopyImmunofluorescence microscopy was performed as described previously (30.Tagaya M. Furuno A. Mizushima S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 466-470Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells plated on coverslips were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, followed by sequential incubation with primary antibodies and a fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated or Texas Red-conjugated secondary antibody. Confocal microscopic analysis was performed with an Olympus Fluoview 300 laser-scanning microscope.RESULTSIdentification of KIAA0725p Homologous to p125The expressed sequence tag data base was searched with the BLAST program using the amino acid sequence of p125. The search revealed the presence of a human expressed sequence tag clone, KIAA0725 (3,911 base pairs), that codes for a homologous protein (KIAA0725p). Clone KIAA0725 encodes 573 amino acid residues but appears to lack nucleotides corresponding to the N-terminal region. To determine the nucleotide sequence 5′-upstream of KIAA0725, the 5′-RACE method was used. We found in RACE products that a putative initiation codon resides 413 nucleotides upstream of the 5′-end of the reported sequence. Although the sequence surrounding this methionine codon did not match the Kozak consensus sequence, one stop codon was found 30 nucleotides upstream of this methionine codon. Therefore, we assumed that this codon is the initiation codon of KIAA0725p.By combining the sequence of the KIAA0725 clone with the 5′-upstream sequence obtained in the 5′-RACE experiments, we identified an open reading frame that encodes a protein of 711 amino acids with a calculated molecular weight of 81,003 (Fig. 1A). As shown in Fig. 1B, KIAA0725p exhibits strong sequence similarity with p125 throughout the entire sequence determined (52.6% identity in the 770-amino acid overlap). KIAA0725p is more similar to p125 than PA-PLA1. KIAA0725p has a consensus sequence for most lipases, Gly-X-Ser-X-Gly, where Xrepresents any amino acid (31.Hide W.A. Chan L. Li W.-H. J. Lipid Res. 1992; 33: 167-178Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Other than this consensus sequence, no significant homology was found with other phospholipases or triacylglycerol lipases. Therefore, it seemed that KIAA0725p is a new member of the PA-PLA1 protein family.KIAA0725p lacks a signal sequence or transmembrane domain, suggesting that it is a cytosolic or peripheral membrane protein. It is noteworthy that KIAA0725p, unlike p125, does not possess a proline-rich region. In addition, KIAA0725p does not have a coiled-coil region, which also exists in the C-terminal region of p125.Tissue and Subcellular Distribution of KIAA0725pAs shown in Fig. 2A, Northern blot analysis with the KIAA0725p probe revealed a 5.4-kb transcript in all tissues examined, suggesting the ubiquitous expression of KIAA0725p. A 2.8-kb transcript was also observed. At present, we do not know whether this smaller transcript is a degradation product derived from the larger one or an alternative splicing product.Figure 2Expression of KIAA0725p. A, Northern blot analysis. Poly(A)+ mRNA human multiple tissue blots were probed with 32P-labeled cDNA of KIAA0725p. B, distribution of KIAA0725p in rat tissues. C, subcellular localization of KIAA0725p. Homogenates of 293T cells were fractionated as described previously (18.Tani K. Mizoguchi T. Iwamatsu A. Hatsuzawa K. Tagaya M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20505-20512Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Proteins (50 μg) in each fraction were separated by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by immunoblotting with an anti-KIAA0725p antibody.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To examine the expression of KIAA0725p in cells, a rabbit polyclonal antibody against bacterially expressed KIAA0725p was prepared and affinity-purified. On immunoblot analysis of various tissue extracts, the affinity-purified antibody detected a protein of 90 kDa (Fig. 2B). This value is in fair agreement with the calculated mass of KIAA0725p. Indeed, this protein exhibited the same mobility on gels as an overexpressed protein in 293T cells that had been transfected with a plasmid encoding the full-length KIAA0725p (data not shown). In addition to this 90-kDa band, an 85-kDa band was observed on the blot. This might represent a degradation product derived from the 90-kDa protein or an alternative translation product in which Met-31 is used as the initiation codon.To clarify the subcellular localization of KIAA0725p, homogenates of 293T cells were fractionated by differential centrifugation. Centrifugation of homogenates at 1,000 × g for 5 min gave PNS and nuclear fractions. The PNS was then centrifuged at 9,000 × g for 10 min, giving rise to supernatant and mitochondrial fractions. From the supernatant fraction, microsomal and cytosolic fractions were obtained by centrifugation at 105,000 ×g for 1 h. The proteins in each fraction were separated by SDS-PAGE and then analyzed by immunoblotting with an anti-KIAA0725p antibody (Fig. 2C). The results showed that KIAA0725p is predominantly localized in the cytosolic fraction in 293T cells, but some was observed in the microsomal fraction. Essentially the same results were obtained for rat liver (data not shown).KIAA0725p Does Not Bind to Sec23pp125 interacts with mouse Sec23p via its N-terminal proline-rich region (18.Tani K. Mizoguchi T. Iwamatsu A. Hatsuzawa K. Tagaya M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20505-20512Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Despite its high sequence similarity with p125, KIAA0725p does not have such a proline-rich region. To determine whether or not KIAA0725p interacts with Sec23p, a pull-down assay was conducted. GST-Sec23p and FLAG-tagged KIAA0725p or FLAG-tagged p125 were transiently expressed in 293T cells. A cell lysate was prepared from each transfectant and then incubated with glutathione beads. The proteins bound to the beads were analyzed by immunoblotting with an anti-FLAG antibody. As shown in Fig. 3A, FLAG-tagged KIAA0725p was not pulled down with GST-Sec23p (lane 2). Under the same conditions, FLAG-tagged p125 was pulled down with GST-Sec23p (lane 1), as observed previously (18.Tani K. Mizoguchi T. Iwamatsu A. Hatsuzawa K. Tagaya M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20505-20512Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). These results suggest that KIAA0725p, unlike p125, does not bind to Sec23p. This observation is consistent with the finding that the proline-rich region, but not the phospholipase-like domain, of p125 interacts with Sec23p.Figure 3KIAA0725p does not bind to Sec23p. A, 293T cells were transfected with the plasmid for GST-Sec23p (lanes 1 and 2) or GST (lanes 3 and 4) in combination with the plasmid for FLAG-p125 (lanes 1 and 3) or FLAG-KIAA0725p (lanes 2 and 4). Lysates of the transfected cells were incubated with glutathione beads, and the bound proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by immunoblotting with an anti-FLAG antibody. B, for estimation of the amounts of expressed proteins in the lysates, 4% of the lysates were analyzed by immunoblotting with an antibody against FLAG (left panel) or GST (right panel). The positions of FLAG-p125, FLAG-KIAA0725p, GST-Sec23p, and GST are indicated.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)KIAA0725p Possesses PLA1 ActivityWe examined whether or not KIAA0725p possesses PLA1 activity. FLAG-tagged KIAA0725p was transiently expressed in 293T cells, and then PLA1 activity in the PNS of the transfected cells was measured essentially as described previously (27.Nagai Y. Aoki J. Sato T. Amano K. Matsuda Y. Arai H. Inoue K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11053-11059Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 4A, the PNS of KIAA0725p-expressed cells showed much higher PLA1 activity compared with the PNS of vector-transfected cells. Among the phospholipids examined, PA and PE were effectively hydrolyzed, whereas PS was weakly hydrolyzed and PC was very weakly hydrolyzed.Figure 4PLA1 activity of KIAA0725p. PLA1 activity in the lysates of cells transfected with the plasmid for FLAG (open bars), wild-type FLAG-KIAA0725p (closed bars), or a S351A mutant (hatched bars) was measured in the absence (A) or presence (B) of 330 μm Triton X-100 as described under “Experimental Procedures.” To confirm the expression of the proteins in cells, portions of cell lysates were separated by SDS-PAGE and then analyzed by immunoblotting with an anti-FLAG antibody.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)KIAA0725p has a stretch of sequence, Gly349-His-Ser-Leu-Gly353, that is common to most lipases including PA-PLA1 (Ser-His-Ser-Leu-Gly). The seryl residue in this sequence is known to be essential for lipase activity (32.Derewenda Z.S. Derewenda U. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1991; 69: 842-851Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). To determine whether or not Ser351 of KIAA0725p is also required for its PLA1 activity, we constructed a KIAA0725p mutant, S351A, in which Ser351 was replaced with alanine to eliminate the hydroxyl group.

Here, we report that protein inhibitor of activated Stat1 (PIAS1) interacts with the tetramerization and C-terminal regulatory domains of p53 in yeast two-hybrid analyses. Endogenous PIAS1 is also associated with endogenous p53 in mammalian cells. Ectopic expression of PIAS1 activates p53-mediated expression in mouse embryonic fibroblast cells (p53 −/−) as well as a variety of other cell lines. Furthermore, ectopic expression of PIAS1 induces p53-mediated expression of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21 and G1arrest of the cell cycle in H1299 cells. In addition, a PIAS1 mutant without the RING-finger domain required for sumoylation could still activate p53-mediated gene expression, indicating that activation of p53 by PIAS1 does not require the RING-finger domain. Taken together, our results suggest that PIAS1 is a novel activator of p53.

In response to damaged DNA, nucleotide depletion, hypoxia, oncogenes, and other genotoxic stresses, p53 accumulates dramatically in nucleus and functions as a transcriptional activator (1Prives C. Hall P.A. J. Pathol. 1999; 187: 112-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (1234) Google Scholar, 2Levine A.J. Cell. 1997; 88: 323-331Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6759) Google Scholar, 3Appella E. Anderson C.W. Eur. J.

Activation of p53 leads to cell cycle arrest or apoptosis by inducing a number of genes including cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21 and apoptotic genes such as Bax. Although the exact mechanisms by which some of these stress signals are transduced to p53 are not known, signaling to p53 is thought to be mediated by upstream p53 regulators in at least three distinguishable pathways (5Vogelstein B. Lane D. Levine A.J. Nature. 2000; 408: 307-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (5850) Google Scholar). The first pathway transduces signals of DNA damage induced by ionizing radiation, which activates ATM, Chk2, and subsequently p53. The second pathway is mediated by p14ARF-MDM2 interaction (6Sherr C.J. Weber J.D. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2000; 10: 94-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (572) Google Scholar), which is triggered by oncogenic signals such as Ras and Myc. The third pathway is turned on by a wide array of chemotherapeutic drugs, UV light, and protein kinase inhibitors, which requires kinases ATR and casein kinase II. There are additional proteins that can activate p53, but the significance of some of these interactions remains to be elucidated (1Prives C. Hall P.A. J. Pathol. 1999; 187: 112-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (1234) Google Scholar). The key negative regulator of the p53 network is MDM2. Transcription of MDM2 is itself activated by p53. However, MDM2 protein can both inhibit the transcriptional activity of p53 and target p53 for ubiquitin-mediated protein degradation (7Haupt Y. Maya R. Kazaz A. Oren M. Nature. 1997; 387: 296-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (3750) Google Scholar, 8Honda R. Tanaka H. Yasuda H. FEBS Lett. 1997; 420: 25-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (1604) Google Scholar, 9Kubbutat M.H. Jones S.N. Vousden K.H. Nature. 1997; 387: 299-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (2860) Google Scholar), forming a negative regulatory loop for p53 function. Interference of the p53 and MDM2 interaction appears to be a main convergent point for many of the stress signals, resulting in stabilization and activation of p53 (10Prives C. Cell. 1998; 95: 5-8Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (629) Google Scholar). The discovery of p63 and p73, the p53 family members, added a new level of complexity to understanding the p53 network (11Yang A. McKeon F. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 1: 199-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar). Bothp63 and p73 produce multiple transcripts, which could either activate or inhibit p53-mediated gene expression. In contrast to p53, p63 and p73 do not interact with most viral proteins and do not undergo MDM2-mediated degradation. Furthermore, mutations of p63 and p73 are rarely detected in cancers, whereas mutation of p53 is the most common defect in cancer cells (for a recent review see Ref.11Yang A. McKeon F. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 1: 199-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar). To identify novel upstream regulators of p53 and its relatives, we have undertaken a systematic two-hybrid screening of p53, p63, p73, and the known components of the p53 network. Here we report the identification of PIAS11 as a novel activator of p53. pcDNA3PIAS1-(c-Flag) and pcDNA3 PIAS1 deletions expressed PIAS1 and PIAS1 truncations that were Flag-tagged at their C termini. The following reagents were generous gifts: PG13-Luc, MG15-Luc, pcDNA-p53, WWP-Luc, and p53(R175H) (B. Vogelstein); p40 (D. Sidransky); Stat1 (J. Darnell); pCMV5-PIAS1 (J. Liao and K. Shui); Tera-1 cells (testicular carcinoma) (V. Jin); Primary mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFp53−/−, 3–4 passages; Pier Paolo Pandolfi). H1299 cells (human lung large cell carcinoma) were purchased from ATCC. Anti-PIAS1 antibody was produced by immunizing New Zealand White rabbits with GST-PIAS1 (residues 47–180) as described previously (12Xu C.W. Hines J.C. Engel M.L. Russell D.G. Ray D.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 564-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Other antibodies used were anti-p21 antibody (Upstate Biotechnology), anti-p53 DO-1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-Flag (M2), and anti-actin antibodies (Sigma). cDNA encoding p63/p40 was cloned at the BamHI and XhoI sites of pCWX200 for two-hybrid screening with a human HeLa cDNA library (13Xu C.W. Mendelsohn A.R. Brent R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 12473-12478Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). For mapping the interaction domains, deletions of p53 and PIAS1 were cloned into pEG202 and pJG4–5 or pJG4–5AAT, respectively (14Gyuris J. Golemis E. Chertkov H. Brent R. Cell. 1993; 75: 791-803Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1324) Google Scholar). p53 (residues 1–50) was not included. The interactions were scored by the expression of β-galactosidase in the two-hybrid mating assay (15Finley Jr., R.L. Brent R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12980-12984Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). MEFs and Tera-1 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's (high glucose) medium with 10% FBS, and H1299 cells were maintained in RPMI medium with 10% FBS (5% CO2 at 37 οC). Cell transfections were carried out with FuGene 6 according to the manufacturer's instruction (Roche). For luciferase assays, cells were plated at 2 × 105cell/60-mm dish and grown overnight before transfection. The total amount of DNA transfected was adjusted with pcDNA3. For cell cycle and Western blotting analyses, cells were plated at a lower density (4 × 105 cells/100-mm dish), and the total amount of DNA was adjusted with salmon sperm DNA (Sigma). Luciferase assays were performed according to the manufacturer's instruction (Tropix). Relative luciferase activity was normalized to protein concentration as determined by the Bradford method (Bio-Rad). Logarithmic Tera-1 cells were treated for 8 h with or without 10 μm etoposide. Cell pellets were rotated in 0.5 ml lysis buffer (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 350 mm NaCl, 1% Triton, 0.2% Sarcosyl, 0.5 mmdithiothreitol, 1 mm NaF, 1 mmNaVO3, 1 tablet of protease inhibitor with EDTA) for 30 min at 4 °C and were subsequently passed through a 26.5-gauge syringe six times to break nuclei. After centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C, aliquots (120 μl, 12 μg of protein) were incubated with protein G-beads (Pharmacia) coated with anti-PIAS1 or normal IgG antibodies for 1 h at 4 °C. Immunoprecipitates were washed four times with 400 μl of the lysis buffer and Western-blotted with anti-p53 DO-1 antibody. Transfected H1299 cells were washed with ice-cold PBS, detached with 5 mm EDTA in PBS, and collected by centrifugation at 4 °C. The cells were extracted in 250 μl of lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 2 mm EGTA, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 14 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 0.5% Triton X-100, and one protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Molecular Biochemicals)) for 30 min on ice, and kept at −80 °C until use. Soluble protein (60 μg) was used for Western blotting analysis. Transfected H1299 cells were washed with PBS, treated with trypsin-EDTA for 1 min at 37 οC, placed immediately on ice, and washed twice with 5 ml of ice-cold WB (10% FBS and 1% BSA in PBS). The cells were resuspended in 2 ml of ice-cold 75% methanol with simultaneous mixing and kept overnight or for several days at 4 °C. The cells were washed with WB, permeablized for 5 min in 1 ml of WB containing 0.25% Triton X-100, and subsequently washed with 5 ml of WB. For labeling, the cells were resuspended in 80 μl of WB and incubated for 60 min at 4οC with 20 μl of fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated anti-p53 antibody (B&D PharMingen). The cells were washed with 5 ml of WB and stained overnight with PBS containing 10 μg/ml propidium iodide (Sigma), 200 Kunitz units/ml RNase A (Sigma), and 0.1% Nonidet P-40. The dual labeled cells were analyzed with an automated bench top flow cytometer (FACSCalibur) equipped with CELLQuest software (Becton Dickinson). Cell cycle phases of FITC-positive cells were determined with MultiCycle software. Our original goal was to identify cellular proteins that discriminate the tumor suppressor protein p53 from its newly discovered relative p40 (16Trink B. Okami K. Wu L. Sriuranpong V. Jen J. Sidransky D. Nat. Med. 1998; 4: 747-748Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar), an alternative splice form of p63 (17Yang A. Kaghad M. Wang Y. Gillett E. Fleming M.D. Dotsch V. Andrews N.C. Caput D. McKeon F. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 305-316Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1851) Google Scholar). We performed a two-hybrid screening for p40 interacting proteins. About 140 positive clones were identified from 4 × 107 library transformants. One-third of the positive clones encoded the carboxyl half of the protein inhibitor of activated Stat1 (PIAS1) (18Liu B. Liao J. Rao X. Kushner S.A. Chung C.D. Chang D.D. Shuai K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 10626-10631Crossref PubMed Scopus (636) Google Scholar). Another third of the positive clones encoded UBC9. Among the rest of the positive clones was a cellular protein that specifically interacted with p40/p63 but not with p53 (data not shown). Both PIAS1 and UBC9 interacted with p53 in the yeast two-hybrid assay (data not shown). In this report, we have focused on the interaction between PIAS1 and p53. The tumor suppressor protein p53 comprises distinct functional domains (2Levine A.J. Cell. 1997; 88: 323-331Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6759) Google Scholar, 4Ryan K.M. Phillips A.C. Vousden K.H. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 332-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (583) Google Scholar, 19Ko L.J. Prives C. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1054-1072Crossref PubMed Scopus (2294) Google Scholar). They include the transcriptional activation domain (residues 1–100), the central DNA binding core domain (100–300), the linker sequence (301–320), the tetramerization domain (320–360) and the C-terminal regulatory domain (363–393). To map which p53 domains are involved in the interaction with the carboxyl and amino deletions of PIAS1, we employed a two-hybrid mating assay (15Finley Jr., R.L. Brent R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12980-12984Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). In this assay, yeast strains expressing PIAS1 or p53 were mated, and interacting domains were scored by the expression of β-galactosidase (Fig. 1). We found that PIAS1(full-length, residues 1–651), PIAS1-(10–651), PIAS1-(1–560), and PIAS1-(306–651) interacted with both p53 and p40/p63. However, neither PIAS1-(1–400) nor PIAS1-(1–480) interacted with p53-(50–393) and p40/p63. We further determined that the tetramerization and C-terminal regulatory domains of p53 were sufficient for PIAS1 interaction. Therefore, the carboxyl half of PIAS1 interacted with the tetramerization and the C-terminal regulatory domains of p53 (Fig. 1 B). To confirm the interaction between PIAS1 and p53, we tested whether endogenous PIAS1 was associated with endogenous p53 by co-immunoprecipitation. Using purified anti-PIAS1 antibodies raised against PIAS1-(47–180), we immunoprecipitated endogenous PIAS1 from extracts of testicular carcinoma cells (Tera-1) that express both endogenous p53 and endogenous PIAS1. The immunoprecipitates were subsequently washed under stringent conditions with a high concentration of NaCl and detergents. The presence of p53 was detected by Western blotting with the anti-p53 antibody DO-1 in the anti-PIAS1 precipitates but not in the normal IgG precipitates (Fig.1 C). We further demonstrated the association between endogenous PIAS1 and endogenous p53 in human hepatoma cells (HepG2) (data not shown). DNA damages and other stress signals lead to the increased levels and activation of p53. To address the question of whether endogenous PIAS1 was associated with endogenous activated p53 under these conditions, logarithmic Tera-1 cells were treated for 8 h with 10 μm etoposide, a DNA-damaging agent. Endogenous co-immunoprecipitation experiments were performed as described above. As shown in Fig. 1 C, PIAS1 interacted with p53 under the stress condition. These data indicate that PIAS1 interacts with p53 in the presence or absence of stress signals. p53 functions as a sequence-specific transcriptional activator. Because PIAS1 and p53 interacted with each other in vivo, we investigated the effects of PIAS1 on p53-mediated gene expression. The PIAS1-expressing vector pcDNA3PIAS1-(c-Flag), alone or in combination with a vector encoding p53 (pcDNA3-p53), was co-transfected into mouse embryonic fibroblast cells (MEF, p53 −/−) together with a reporter containing a synthetic p53 binding site placed upstream of the luciferase reporter gene (PG13-Luc). Ectopic expression of p53 produced a marked stimulation of transcription. A significant stimulation (2-fold) of the reporter above the levels observed with p53 alone was specifically induced by coexpression of PIAS1 in a dose-dependent manner (Fig.2 A). In contrast, ectopic expression of PIAS1 did not activate the expression of the luciferase reporter containing a synthetic mutant p53 binding site (MG15-Luc) in the same MEF cells (p53 −/− ) (Fig.2 A). We next evaluated the effects of PIAS1 on p53-dependent transcription in H1299 cells lacking endogenous p53. As shown in Fig. 2 B, ectopic expression of PIAS1 activated p53-mediated expression of PG13-Luc in a dose-dependent manner but did not stimulate the expression of MG15-Luc, again suggesting that PIAS1 could activate p53-mediated gene expression. Furthermore, ectopic expression of PIAS1 activated the expression of PG13-Luc in testicular carcinoma cells (Tera-1, wide type p53) (Fig. 2 C). In addition, ectopic expression of PIAS1-(10–651) activated p53-dependent transcription in additional cell lines such as U3A, Saos-2, and HeLa cells (data not shown), further suggesting that PIAS1 activates p53-mediated gene expression in a variety of cell types. p53 functions as a transcriptional activator that induces expression of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21 (5Vogelstein B. Lane D. Levine A.J. Nature. 2000; 408: 307-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (5850) Google Scholar). To test whether PIAS1 activates p53-dependent expression of p21, we transiently transfected a WWP luciferase construct containing the p21 promoter (WWP-Luc) and plasmids expressing PIAS1 or p53. As shown in Fig. 3 A, PIAS1 could only modestly activate p53-dependent expression of the reporter. We next examined whether PIAS1 could induce p53-dependent expression of endogenous p21 protein by transiently expressing PIAS1, wild-type p53, or mutant p53 (R175H) defective in the DNA binding in H1299 cells. Ectopic expression of PIAS1 stimulated a marked increase in the levels of endogenous p21 protein in the presence of wild-type p53 (Fig. 3 B). In contrast, PIAS1 alone or in combination with p53(R175H) had no effect on expression of the endogenous p21. In addition, ectopic expression of PIAS1 increased steady-state levels of p53 (Figs. 3 B and4 B). These data indicate that PIAS1 activates p53-dependent expression of the endogenous p21 protein.Figure 4PIAS1 -(400–651) lacking the RING-finger domain activates p53-mediated gene expression. A, PIAS1-(400–651) activates p53-dependent expression of PG13-Luc in H1299 cells. A luciferase assay was performed as described in the legend for Fig. 2 B except that 2 μg of PIAS1 constructs were used. B, PIAS1-(400–651) activates p53-dependent expression of endogenous p21 protein. The assay was as described in the legend for Fig. 3 B. PIAS1(full-length, 1–651), PIAS1-(1–480), and PIAS1-(400–651) were Flag-tagged Flag at the C terminus, but PIAS1-(10–651) was not tagged.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We next investigated whether PIAS1 could also induce p53-dependent cell cycle arrest. H1299 cells were transiently transfected with plasmids expressing PIAS1 and wild-type p53 or mutant p53(R175H). Small amounts (25 ng) of pcDNA-p53 or pcDNA3-p53(R175H) were used so that p53 alone would have a minimal effect on G1 arrest of the cell cycle (about 60%). A representative experiment indicated that ectopic expression of PIAS1 induced about 8.5% more G1 arrest in cells expressing wild-type p53 than those expressing p53(R175H) (Fig. 3 C). These observations were further validated in six additional independent experiments done in duplicate. It is also noted that PIAS1 could induce G1 arrest of the cell cycle in the presence of p53(R175H). Although PIAS1 might have other roles, our data clearly demonstrate that PIAS1 can stimulate p53-dependent G1arrest of the cell cycle. It has recently been discovered that PIAS1 functions as an E3 ligase for the covalent attachment of small ubiquitin-related modifier (SUMO-1) to p53 in vitro and in transfected cells (20Kahyo T. Nishida T. Yasuda H. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar). The RING-finger domain of PIAS1-(325–382) is essential for the interaction of PIAS1 with UBC9 and SUMO-1. Deletion of this domain abolishes PIAS1-mediated sumoylation of p53 (20Kahyo T. Nishida T. Yasuda H. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar). To examine whether the RING-finger domain is required for the activation of p53 by PIAS1, we used mutant PIAS1-(400–651), which lack the RING-finger domain but still interacted with p53. Plasmids expressing p53, PG13-Luc, and PIAS1-(400–651) were co-transfected to H1299 cells. As shown in Fig. 4 A, PIAS1-(400–651) activated p53-dependent expression of PG-13 even better than PIAS1(full-length, 1–651). Furthermore, PIAS1-(400–651) induced p53-dependent expression of endogenous p21 protein to the same extent as PIAS1 and other PIAS1 deletions. PIAS1 and PIAS1 deletions alone and in combination with p53(R175H) could not induce the expression of endogenous p21. These data clearly indicate that the RING-finger domain of PIAS1 is not essential for the activation of p53 by PIAS1. We have found that endogenous PIAS1 interacts with endogenous p53 in vivo in the presence and absence of stress signals, suggesting that PIAS1 is complexed with both latent and activated endogenous p53. Ectopic expression of PIAS1 activates p53-mediated expression of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21 and stimulates p53-dependent G1arrest of the cell cycle, suggesting that PIAS1 is a novel activator of p53. PIAS1 is a multifunctional protein that was first identified as a protein inhibitor of activated Stat1 (18Liu B. Liao J. Rao X. Kushner S.A. Chung C.D. Chang D.D. Shuai K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.

Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 1334-1348Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). PIAS1 is almost identical to RNA Gu helicase-binding protein except for the first nine amino acid residues (24Valdez B.C. Henning D. Perlaky L. Busch R.K. Busch H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 234: 335-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Furthermore, PIAS1 is a putative coactivator of androgen receptors in an androgen-dependent manner and co-activator of glucocorticoid receptor in the presence of dexamethasone (25Tan J. Hall S.H. Hamil K.G. Grossman G. Petrusz P. Liao J. Shuai K. French F.S. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 14: 14-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 26Gross M. Liu B. Tan J. French F.S. Carey M. Shuai K. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 3880-3887Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). In addition, PIAS1 induces apoptosis through c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK) (27Liu B. Shuai K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 36624-36631Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). It is not known whether the p53 network cross-talks through PIAS1 with pathways mediated by Stat1, androgen receptors, RNA helicase, or JNK. Because JNK is important for p53 stabilization and transcriptional activation (28Buschmann T. Potapova O. Bar-Shira A. Ivanov V.N. Fuchs S.Y. Henderson S. Fried V.A. Minamoto T. Alarcon-Vargas D. Pincus M.R. Gaarde W.A. Holbrook N.J. Shiloh Y. Ronai Z. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 2743-2754Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar) and PIAS1 activates p53 (this study), it is possible that PIAS1-induced apoptosis through JNK involves p53. During this project, PIAS1 was independently identified as an interactor of mutant p53 in a two-hybrid screening (29Gallagher W.M. Argentini M. Sierra V. Bracco L. Debussche L. Conseiller E. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 3608-3616Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). In addition, PIAS1 was identified as an E3 ligase for sumoylation of p53, which requires the RING-finger domain (residues 325–382) of PIAS1 (20Kahyo T. Nishida T. Yasuda H. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar). However, the functional role of PIAS1 in the activity of p53 has not been investigated in these studies (20Kahyo T. Nishida T. Yasuda H. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar, 29Gallagher W.M. Argentini M. Sierra V. Bracco L. Debussche L. Conseiller E. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 3608-3616Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). In our study, PIAS1-(400–651) lacking the RING-finger efficiently activated p53-mediated gene expression (Fig. 4), implying that p53 activation by PIAS1 is independent of PIAS1-mediated sumoylation of p53. Although earlier studies suggested that sumoylation activates p53 (30Rodriguez M.S. Desterro J.M. Lain S. Midgley C.A. Lane D.P. Hay R.T.

Derry J. Tyner A.L. Shen Z. Gudkov A.V. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 2587-2599Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 34Minty A. Dumont X. Kaghad M. Caput D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 36316-36323Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). We noted that PIAS1-(10–651) was much more potent in activating p53-mediated gene expression in a variety of cell lines than PIAS1(full-length, 1–651) (for example, Fig. 4). The marked difference between PIAS1 and PIAS1-(10–651) is also evident in their inhibition of activated Stat1. Unlike PIAS1, PIAS1-(10–651) does not inhibit activated Stat1 (27Liu B. Shuai K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 36624-36631Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Another PIAS1 mutant (1–480), which did not interact with p53 (Fig. 1 A), weakly activated the expression of p53-mediated PG13-Luc (Fig. 4 A) but strongly induced p53-dependent expression of endogenous p21 (Fig.4 B). The N-terminal half of PIAS1 is known to modulate the interaction between PIAS1 and activated Stat1 even though the N-terminal half of PIAS1 does not interact with Stat1 (21Liao J. Fu Y. Shuai K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 5267-5272Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). It remains to be determined whether PIAS1-(1–480) plays a role in activating p53-dependent gene expression by a similar indirect mechanism. The tetramerization and the C-terminal regulatory domains of p53 is involved in the interaction with PIAS1 (Fig. 1, A andB). These p53 domains are known to regulate stability, nuclear export control, and activation of p53 (3Appella E. Anderson C.W. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 2764-2772Crossref PubMed Scopus (916) Google Scholar, 4Ryan K.M. Phillips A.C. Vousden K.H. Curr. Opin.

We found that PIAS1 increased the steady-state levels of p53 (Fig.4 B) and the half-life of p53 (data not shown). It is currently under investigation as to whether PIAS1 activates the p53 function by modulating covalent and noncovalent states of p53 through the tetramerization and the C-terminal domains and/or by breaking the negative regulatory loop between MDM2 and p53. In summary, our present study suggests that PIAS1 is a novel activator of p53.

We have shown previously that the basic helix-loop-helix protein, BETA2/NeuroD, induces cell cycle withdrawal in addition to increasing secretin gene expression. A number of transcription factors important for differentiation are repressed by D cyclins. Repression by D cyclins appears to be independent of its effects on the cell cycle. We show that cyclin D1 represses BETA2/NeuroD-dependent transcription of the secretin gene. Examination of cyclin box mutants shows that repression is unrelated to Cdk4 activation. Although cyclin D1 and BETA2 associatein vivo, they do not directly interact. Cyclin D1 may be recruited to BETA2 by binding to the C-terminal domain of the p300 coactivator, downstream from the BETA2-binding site. In the small intestine, cyclin D1 expression occurs only in the actively proliferating crypts of Lieberkuhn but not in villi. Thus repression by cyclin D1 may serve to prevent secretin gene transcription from occurring in relatively immature epithelial progenitor cells.

Cellular proliferation is restricted to the crypt compartment where totipotent stem cells reside. As cells migrate up the crypt-villus axis, proliferating cells cease to divide and differentiate into each respective epithelial cell lineage. Secretin-expressing enteroendocrine cells represent a subpopulation of enteroendocrine cells found exclusively in the villus epithelium. Tritiated thymidine labeling studies showed that expression of the hormone secretin occurs only after cells cease dividing (1Inokuchi H. Fujimoto S. Hattori T. Kawai K. Gastroenterology. 1985; 89: 1014-1020Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). These characteristics suggest that factors involved in cell cycle regulation may also regulate the terminal differentiation program of the secretin cell.We have shown previously (2Naya F.J. Stellrecht C.M.M. Tsai M.-J. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1009-1019Crossref PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar) that BETA2/NeuroD, a basic helix-loop-helix protein, is essential for expression of the secretin gene. BETA2 null mice failed to develop secretin- and cholecystokinin-expressing cells, whereas the remaining enteroendocrine cell populations appeared relatively unaffected (3Naya F.J. Huang H. Qiu Y. Mutoh H. DeMayo F. Leiter A.B. Tsai M.-J. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2323-2334Crossref PubMed Scopus (844) Google Scholar). BETA2 binds to an E box sequence in the secretin gene heterodimerized with one of several ubiquitously expressed products of the E2A gene (4Mutoh H. Fung B. Naya F. Tsai M.-J. Nishitani J. Leiter A.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3560-3564Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar) and functionally associates with the p300/CREB-binding protein coactivators (5Mutoh H. Naya F.J. Tsai M.-J. Leiter A.B. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 820-830Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Overexpression of BETA2 in cell lines induces cell growth arrest. Observations in BETA2 null mice further support a role for BETA2 in inducing cell cycle arrest in endocrine cells in the small intestine. Normally quiescent cells stained for S phase markers indicating reentry into the cell cycle in the absence of a functional BETA2 gene (5Mutoh H. Naya F.J. Tsai M.-J. Leiter A.B. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 820-830Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Taken together, these findings suggest that BETA2 plays a key role in the coordination of terminal differentiation of secretin cells with their cell cycle withdrawal.The stratification of proliferation and differentiation along the crypt-villus axis of the intestine suggests a close relationship between execution of a terminal differentiation program and expression of proteins that regulate G1/S progression. The early G1 cyclins D1, D2, and D3 have a well established role in progression through the G1 phase of the cell cycle. D-type cyclins assemble with cyclin-dependent kinases (Cdks)1 to phosphorylate target proteins such as pRb. Cyclins have been identified as positive regulators of the cell cycle. In the murine small intestine, cyclin D1 expression has been studied in most detail and is limited to cells within the crypt compartment, whereas its partner, Cdk4, is more widely distributed in both the crypt and nonproliferating villus compartment (6Chandrasekaran C. Coopersmith C.M. Gordon J.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28414-28421Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). This observation suggests that the cyclin functions as the rate-limiting partner in the assembly of active kinase in the intestine as has been suggested for other tissues (7Zhang J.-M. Wei Q. Zhao X. Paterson B.M. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 926-933Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar).In addition to their established role in regulating the activity of Cdk4/6, D-type cyclins appear to modify the activity of transcription factors, a function that does not require an association with Cdks and therefore does not involve regulation of target protein phosphorylation. These functions may coordinate gene transcription with cell cycle activity. D cyclins increase the activity of the estrogen receptor, an activity that may help stimulate proliferation of breast tissue with estrogen-induced mammary differentiation (8Neuman E. Ladha M.H. Lin N. Upton T.M. Miller S.J. DiRenzo J. Pestell R.G. Hinds P.W. Dowdy S.F. Brown M. Ewen M.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5338-5347Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar, 9Zwijsen R.M.L.

More commonly, D-type cyclins appear to repress transcriptional activity of transcription factors important for inducing terminal differentiation. This repression does not appear to require catalytically active Cdk4. Examples include v-Myb (10Ganter B. Fu S.-L. Lipsick J.S. EMBO J. 1998; 14: 255-268Crossref Scopus (82) Google Scholar) and DMP1 (11Inoue K. Sherr C.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1590-1600Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar) as well as the myogenic bHLH proteins MyoD (12Rao S.S. Chu C. Kohtz D.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5259-5267Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 13Skapek S.X. Rhee J. Spicer D.B. Lassar A.B. Science. 1995; 267: 1022-1024Crossref PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar) and myogenin (14Skapek S.X. Rhee J. Kim P.S. Novitch B.G. Lassar A.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 7043-7053Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar).In the present work, we show that transcriptional activity of BETA2 is repressed by cyclin D1. Repression does not require association of cyclin D1 with Cdks. In addition, cyclin D1 does not appear to interact directly with BETA2 but instead associates with the C-terminal domain of the transcriptional coactivator p300, which functions as a scaffold to recruit cyclin D1 on BETA2-containing complexes. Repression of the secretin gene by cyclin D1 in small intestinal crypts may prevent secretin gene expression in immature proliferating progenitor cells.DISCUSSIOND cyclins have implicated as negative regulators of transcription for a number of proteins including the myogenic basic helix-loop-helix proteins, myogenin, and MyoD (14Skapek S.X. Rhee J. Kim P.S. Novitch B.G. Lassar A.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 7043-7053Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar); v-Myb (10Ganter B. Fu S.-L. Lipsick J.S. EMBO J. 1998; 14: 255-268Crossref Scopus (82) Google Scholar) (but not c-Myb); the Myb-like protein, DMP1 (11Inoue K. Sherr C.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1590-1600Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar); and Sp1 (24Adnane J. Shao Z. Robbins P.D. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 239-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). In the case of the estrogen receptor, D cyclins appear to activate transcription especially in the absence of ligand (8Neuman E. Ladha M.H. Lin N. Upton T.M. Miller S.J. DiRenzo J. Pestell R.G. Hinds P.W. Dowdy S.F. Brown M. Ewen M.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5338-5347Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar, 25Zwijsen R.M. Buckle R.S. Hijmans E.M. Loomans C.J. Bernards R. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3488-3498Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar).The present study shows that cyclin D1 functions as a transcriptional repressor of the basic helix-loop-helix protein, BETA2/NeuroD. The work described here adds to an increasing body of data indicating that D cyclins regulate transcription independently of their effects on the enzymatic activity of cyclin-dependent kinases. Transcriptional repression of BETA2 by cyclin D1 is notable in that unlike most other transcription factors, cyclin D1 does not directly interact with BETA2 but instead is recruited to BETA2-containing complexes through direct binding to p300.Initial observations showing that cyclin D1 repressed MyoD activity suggested that phosphorylation of MyoD or other proteins by activated Cdk4 might represent the mechanism of repression. Indeed, earlier observations (13Skapek S.X. Rhee J. Spicer D.B. Lassar A.B. Science. 1995; 267: 1022-1024Crossref PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar) showed that overexpression of p21 overcame repression of MyoD by cyclin D1 and were consistent with the hypothesized phosphorylation as was the identification of phosphorylated forms of MyoD. Like MyoD, myogenin is inhibited by cyclin D1. However, overexpression of cyclin D1 failed to alter significantly the phosphorylation of either MyoD or myogenin (14Skapek S.X. Rhee J. Kim P.S. Novitch B.G. Lassar A.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 7043-7053Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Furthermore, a mutant, fully active myogenin with alanine residues replacing the two phosphorylated serine residues, was inhibited comparably to the wild type myogenin (14Skapek S.X. Rhee J. Kim P.S. Novitch B.G. Lassar A.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 7043-7053Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Thus it appears unlikely that transcriptional repression of myogenic bHLH proteins by cyclin D1 results from their phosphorylation by cyclin D1-dependent kinases (7Zhang J.-M. Wei Q. Zhao X. Paterson B.M. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 926-933Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar).In the case of other transcription factors, including BETA2 described here, v-Myb, the estrogen receptor, and DMP1, cyclin D1 mutants that cannot interact with Cdk4/6 retain their ability to regulate transcriptional activity. In all cases where examined, Cdk4 does not reproduce or enhance the effects of D cyclins, further indicating that the transcriptional changes induced by D cyclins represent an activity distinct from the regulation of Cdks.Generally, overexpression of Cdk4 does not reproduce the effects of cyclin D1. In the case of the ER, cotransfection of Cdk4 with cyclin D1 reversed the effect of D1 suggesting that only “free” D1 not associated with Cdk4 functioned as a transcriptional modifier (9Zwijsen R.M.L. Wientjens E. Klompmaker R. van der Sman J. Bernards R. Michalides R.J.A.M. Cell. 1997; 88: 405-415Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (615) Google Scholar). Likewise, Cdk4 reduces the level of association between TAF(II)250 and cyclin D1 required for Sp1 repression as does an excess of transfected pRb (24Adnane J. Shao Z. Robbins P.D. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 239-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). It is not known whether activation of Cdk4 is involved in the effects of cyclin D1 on Sp1 although reversal of repression by Cdk4 argues against this possibility. The failure to identify any Cdk 4/6 activity in BETA2 immunoprecipitates containing cyclin D1 may indicate that only free D1 is available for transcriptional regulation. However, the failure to overcome repression with Cdk4 suggests that BETA2/p300 and Cdk4 do not directly compete for limiting amounts of cyclin D1.Of the three D-type cyclins, D1 appears to be the strongest repressor of BETA2. The observed potency of D1 has been noted in several other cases as well. In one case, the activation of the estrogen receptor was highly specific for cyclin D1 (9Zwijsen R.M.L. Wientjens E. Klompmaker R. van der Sman J. Bernards R. Michalides R.J.A.M. Cell. 1997; 88: 405-415Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (615) Google Scholar), whereas in a second report, D1 was the most potent activator of the ER with less activation seen with D2 and D3 (8Neuman E. Ladha M.H. Lin N. Upton T.M. Miller S.J. DiRenzo J. Pestell R.G. Hinds P.W. Dowdy S.F. Brown M. Ewen M.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5338-5347Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). Cyclins D1 and D2 were capable of inhibiting MyoD, whereas D3 showed little effect (13Skapek S.X. Rhee J. Spicer D.B. Lassar A.B. Science. 1995; 267: 1022-1024Crossref PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar). In the case of v-Myb, all three D cyclins were inhibitory with D1 > D2 > D3. All three D cyclins functioned as equipotent inhibitors of DMP1 (11Inoue K. Sherr C.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1590-1600Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar).The relative potency of cyclin D1 versus D2 and D3 as transcriptional modifiers was not anticipated given the homology of D2 and D3 with D1 (71 and 63% similar, respectively). Of note the central region, including the cyclin box, is highly conserved among the three. However, this region appears to be dispensable for transcriptional repression. With the exception of the LXCXE motif at the N terminus, the N- and C-terminal domains of cyclins D2 and D3 are much less highly conserved with D1. The N terminus of cyclin D1 (amino acids 1–100) appears to be sufficient for its association with TAF(II)250 in order to repress Sp1 (24Adnane J. Shao Z. Robbins P.D. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 239-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The region of cyclin D1 required for repression has been examined for MyoD as well. Similar to the present work, mutations in the N-terminal pRb binding consensus sequence in cyclin D1 did not affect transcriptional repression. However, a C-terminal truncation mutant containing only the first 202 amino acids of cyclin D1 did not repress MyoD (12Rao S.S. Chu C. Kohtz D.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5259-5267Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar).There is no single mechanism to account for how cyclins regulate transcription, although most evidence indicates that activation of cyclin-dependent kinases is not critical. In the present work, we found that transcriptional repression of BETA2 by cyclin D1 is indirect, unlike most other transcription factors studied that directly interact with cyclin D1. Instead, cyclin D1 appears to target p300 by associating with the C-terminal third of the protein thus representing a new pathway for transcriptional regulation by cyclin D1. Although we showed weak binding of cyclin D1 in vitro to other regions of p300, it does not appear that these potential interactions contribute to repression. Thus cyclin D1 does not appear to target an intrinsic activation domain in the N terminus of p300 nor the central region that contains histone acetyltransferase (HAT) activity.The intrinsic transcriptional activating activity in the C-terminal third of p300 appears to be repressed by cyclin D1. This region of p300 contains the binding sites for pCAF, E1A, and BETA2. However, the strongest cyclin D1 binding activity was localized about 200 residues further toward the C terminus of p300, making it unlikely that there is direct competition with BETA2 or pCAF. Thus p300 appears to function as a scaffold to recruit cyclin D1 to BETA2-containing complexes. Repression of RelA activity by cyclin E similarly does not involve a direct interaction. Cyclin E binds to the C terminus of p300, a site that is distinct from the RelA-binding site at the N terminus of the coactivator (26Perkins N.D. Felzien L.K. Betts J.C. Leung K. Beach D.H. Nabel G.J. Nature. 1997; 275: 523-527Google Scholar). The effects of cyclin D1 on Sp1 also appear to be indirect, mediated through association with TAF(II)250. Cyclin D1 may displace pRb from TAF(II)250, thereby disrupting interaction with Sp1-TAF(II)110 with TAF(II)250 (24Adnane J. Shao Z. Robbins P.D. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 239-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar).Other transcription factors appear to be regulated differently by D cyclins. Direct association of D cyclins with DMP1 appears to inhibit transcription by disrupting the formation of DMP1-DNA complexes (11Inoue K. Sherr C.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1590-1600Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). However, we observed no reduction in the ability to form BETA-DNA complexes in electrophoretic mobility shift assays in the presence of added cyclin D1. Similarly, cyclin D1 had no effect on the ability of v-Myb, MyoD, myogenin, and the estrogen receptor to bind to DNA.It has been suggested that the mechanism for cyclin D1 repression of MyoD involves cyclin D1-mediated nuclear translocation of Cdk4, allowing Cdk4 to bind to a 15-amino acid motif in the C terminus of MyoD (7Zhang J.-M. Wei Q. Zhao X. Paterson B.M. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 926-933Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 27Zhang J. Zhao X. Wei Q. Paterson B.M. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6983-6993Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Cdk4-associated MyoD appears to be unable to bind to DNA with its dimerization partner E12. In contrast, myogenin and BETA2 both lack the Cdk4-binding site and are not repressed by Cdk4. The failure to increase repression in cells cotransfected with both Cdk4 and cyclin D1 as well as the potency of the cyclin D1-KE mutant also argue against a similar mechanism for BETA2. Thus cyclin D1-directed nuclear translocation of Cdk4 might represent a specific mechanism for inhibition of MyoD not applicable to other bHLH proteins.Activation of the estrogen receptor by cyclin D1 appears to occur through a mechanism that is distinct from transcriptional inhibition. Cyclin D appears to function as a bridging molecule to assemble ternary complexes with the ER. In one case, pCAF may be recruited to the ER by cyclin D1 to potentiate the effects of cyclin D1 (28McMahon C. Suthiphongchai T. DiRenzo J. Ewen M.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 5382-5387Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). In addition, leucine-rich motifs in the C-terminal third of cyclin D1 directly bind to the steroid hormone coactivator, SRC1. Ternary complexes of ER, D1, and SRC1 allow the ER to bind to DNA in the absence of ligand and to activate transcription (25Zwijsen R.M. Buckle R.S. Hijmans E.M. Loomans C.J. Bernards R. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3488-3498Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). It would appear unlikely that recruitment of SRC1 is involved in repression of BETA2 as SRC1 has no effect on BETA2-dependent transcription. It is notable that the region of p300 we identified that binds to cyclin D1 may overlap the region known to associate with SRC1.Cyclin D1 repression of BETA2 may contribute to the temporal and spatial differentiation of secretin-expressing enteroendocrine cells in the intestine. Each of the four major epithelial cell lineages in the intestine, including enteroendocrine cells, arises from a common totipotent stem cell in the intestinal crypts. Cells migrate in vertical sheets up the crypt-villus axis into the villus compartment where they stop dividing and terminally differentiate. Cyclin D1 expression is restricted to proliferating cells in the intestinal crypts and disappears in the villi. Secretin-expressing enteroendocrine cells are found only in the villi and never stain for markers of S phase. Thus, expression of cyclin D1 in the intestinal crypts may play a role in delaying expression of the secretin gene in immature progenitor cells until they further differentiate and enter the villus compartment. The importance of transcriptional repression by cyclin D1 in preventing premature differentiation of other epithelial lineages in the proliferating crypt compartment has not been studied. A number of transcription factors implicated in enterocyte differentiation, including GATA-4, -5,-6, and GKLF, are not appreciably expressed in the lower crypt and are unlikely to be repressed by cyclin D1 (29Gao X. Sedgwick T. Shi Y.-B. Evans T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2901-2911Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar, 30Shields J.M. Christy R.J. Yang V.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20009-20017Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (561) Google Scholar). However, HNF-1α, Cdx-1, and Cdx-2 are expressed in the lower crypt and are candidates for repression by cyclin D1 (31Serfas M.S. Tyner A.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 265: G506-G513PubMed Google Scholar, 32Silberg D. Swain G.P. Suh E.R. Traber P.G. Gastroenterology. 2000; 119: 961-971Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar). Such a role for cyclin D1 remains entirely speculative at this time. The mammalian small intestinal epithelium undergoes continuous self-renewal and differentiation along the crypt-villus axis. Cellular proliferation is restricted to the crypt compartment where totipotent stem cells reside. As cells migrate up the crypt-villus axis, proliferating cells cease to divide and differentiate into each respective epithelial cell lineage. Secretin-expressing enteroendocrine cells represent a subpopulation of enteroendocrine cells found exclusively in the villus epithelium. Tritiated thymidine labeling studies showed that expression of the hormone secretin occurs only after cells cease dividing (1Inokuchi H. Fujimoto S. Hattori T. Kawai K. Gastroenterology. 1985; 89: 1014-1020Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). These characteristics suggest that factors involved in cell cycle regulation may also regulate the terminal differentiation program of the secretin cell. We have shown previously (2Naya F.J. Stellrecht C.M.M. Tsai M.-J. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1009-1019Crossref PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar) that BETA2/NeuroD, a basic helix-loop-helix protein, is essential for expression of the secretin gene. BETA2 null mice failed to develop secretin- and cholecystokinin-expressing cells, whereas the remaining enteroendocrine cell populations appeared relatively unaffected (3Naya F.J. Huang H. Qiu Y. Mutoh H. DeMayo F. Leiter A.B. Tsai M.-J. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2323-2334Crossref PubMed Scopus (844) Google Scholar). BETA2 binds to an E box sequence in the secretin gene heterodimerized with one of several ubiquitously expressed products of the E2A gene (4Mutoh H. Fung B. Naya F. Tsai M.-J. Nishitani J. Leiter A.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3560-3564Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar) and functionally associates with the p300/CREB-binding protein coactivators (5Mutoh H. Naya F.J. Tsai M.-J. Leiter A.B. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 820-830Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Overexpression of BETA2 in cell lines induces cell growth arrest. Observations in BETA2 null mice further support a role for BETA2 in inducing cell cycle arrest in endocrine cells in the small intestine. Normally quiescent cells stained for S phase markers indicating reentry into the cell cycle in the absence of a functional BETA2 gene (5Mutoh H. Naya F.J. Tsai M.-J. Leiter A.B. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 820-830Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Taken together, these findings suggest that BETA2 plays a key role in the coordination of terminal differentiation of secretin cells with their cell cycle withdrawal. The stratification of proliferation and differentiation along the crypt-villus axis of the intestine suggests a close relationship between execution of a terminal differentiation program and expression of proteins that regulate G1/S progression. The early G1 cyclins D1, D2, and D3 have a well established role in progression through the G1 phase of the cell cycle. D-type cyclins assemble with cyclin-dependent kinases (Cdks)1 to phosphorylate target proteins such as pRb. Cyclins have been identified as positive regulators of the cell cycle. In the murine small intestine, cyclin D1 expression has been studied in most detail and is limited to cells within the crypt compartment, whereas its partner, Cdk4, is more widely distributed in both the crypt and nonproliferating villus compartment (6Chandrasekaran C. Coopersmith C.M. Gordon J.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28414-28421Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). This observation suggests that the cyclin functions as the rate-limiting partner in the assembly of active kinase in the intestine as has been suggested for other tissues (7Zhang J.-M. Wei Q. Zhao X. Paterson B.M. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 926-933Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). In addition to their established role in regulating the activity of Cdk4/6, D-type cyclins appear to modify the activity of transcription factors, a function that does not require an association with Cdks and therefore does not involve regulation of target protein phosphorylation. These functions may coordinate gene transcription with cell cycle activity. D cyclins increase the activity of the estrogen receptor, an activity that may help stimulate proliferation of breast tissue with estrogen-induced mammary differentiation (8Neuman E. Ladha M.H. Lin N. Upton T.M. Miller S.J. DiRenzo J. Pestell R.G. Hinds P.W. Dowdy S.F. Brown M. Ewen M.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5338-5347Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar, 9Zwijsen R.M.L.

More commonly, D-type cyclins appear to repress transcriptional activity of transcription factors important for inducing terminal differentiation. This repression does not appear to require catalytically active Cdk4. Examples include v-Myb (10Ganter B. Fu S.-L. Lipsick J.S. EMBO J. 1998; 14: 255-268Crossref Scopus (82) Google Scholar) and DMP1 (11Inoue K. Sherr C.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1590-1600Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar) as well as the myogenic bHLH proteins MyoD (12Rao S.S. Chu C. Kohtz D.S. Mol. Cell.

Biol. 1996; 16: 7043-7053Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). In the present work, we show that transcriptional activity of BETA2 is repressed by cyclin D1. Repression does not require association of cyclin D1 with Cdks. In addition, cyclin D1 does not appear to interact directly with BETA2 but instead associates with the C-terminal domain of the transcriptional coactivator p300, which functions as a scaffold to recruit cyclin D1 on BETA2-containing complexes. Repression of the secretin gene by cyclin D1 in small intestinal crypts may prevent secretin gene expression in immature proliferating progenitor cells. DISCUSSIOND cyclins have implicated as negative regulators of transcription for a number of proteins including the myogenic basic helix-loop-helix proteins, myogenin, and MyoD (14Skapek S.X. Rhee J. Kim P.S. Novitch B.G. Lassar A.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 7043-7053Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar); v-Myb (10Ganter B. Fu S.-L. Lipsick J.S.

In the case of the estrogen receptor, D cyclins appear to activate transcription especially in the absence of ligand (8Neuman E. Ladha M.H. Lin N. Upton T.M. Miller S.J. DiRenzo J. Pestell R.G.

In response to uni-axial cyclic stretch, NF-kappaB was found to be translocated into the nucleus. The NF-kappaB was first detectable 2 min after the onset of stretch and then peaked at 4 min and returned to the basal level within 10 min. To investigate whether NF-kappaB is activated following the translocation into the nucleus, we measured the luciferase activity in the cells transfected with pNF-kappaB-luciferase. The activity of luciferase increased 4 min after the initiation of cyclic stretch, peaked at 15 min (6.4-fold increase), and decreased gradually. We examined the involvement of the stretch-activated (SA) channel in the stretch-induced NF-kappaB activation. The application of Gd3+, a blocker of the SA channel, or the removal of extracellular Ca2+ inhibited both the translocation into the nucleus and the activation of NF-kB, which suggests that NF-kappaB is activated by uni-axial cyclic stretch via SA channel activation in human lung fibroblasts."
https://openalex.org/W2075121435,"Human papillomavirus (HPV) is an important etiological agent in the genesis of cervical cancer. HPV-positive cervical tumors and human papillomavirus-positive cell lines display increased epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) expression, which is associated with increased cell proliferation. ECE16-1 cells are an HPV-immortalized human ectocervical epithelial cell line that is a model of HPV-associated cervical neoplasia and displays elevated EGFR levels. In the present study, we evaluated the effects of receptor-selective retinoid ligands on EGFR-associated signal transduction. We show that retinoic acid receptor (RAR)-selective ligands reduce EGFR level and the magnitude and duration of EGFR activation in EGF-stimulated cells. These effects are reversed by cotreatment with an RAR antagonist. To identify the mechanism, we examined the effects of retinoid treatments on EGF-dependent signaling. Stimulation with EGF causes a biphasic activation of the ERK1/2 MAPK. The first peak of activation is present at 20 min, and the second is present at 36 h. This activation subsequently leads to an increase in the cyclin D1 level and increased cell proliferation. Simultaneous treatment with EGF and a RAR-selective retinoid inhibits both phases of ERK1/2 activation, completely eliminates the cyclin D1 induction, and suppresses EGF-dependent cell proliferation. This effect is specific as retinoid treatment does not alter the level or activity of other EGFR-regulated kinases, including AKT and the MAPKs p38 and JNK. Retinoid X receptor-selective ligands, in contrast, did not regulate these responses.

HPV encodes two oncogenes, E6 and E7, which immortalize cervical cells in culture, and are believed to play a key causal role, along with chemical mutagens, in the genesis of cervical cancer (10Munger K.

Retinoid regulation of cervical cell function has been studied in both normal and HPV16-immortalized human cervical epithelial cells. These studies show that, at physiological levels, retinoids do not affect the growth of normal human ectocervical cells but markedly suppress the growth of HPV16-immortalized cells. Moreover, cell proliferation can be inhibited under conditions where E6 and E7 expression is not reduced (2Sizemore N. Kasturi L. Gorodeski G. Eckert R.L. Jetten A.M. Rorke E.A.

These products interact with and activate retinoid nuclear receptors that act to regulate transcription (15Mangelsdorf D.J. Kliewer S.A. Kakizuka A. Umesono K. Evans R.M. Recent Prog. Horm. Res. 1993; 48: 99-121Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). There are two retinoid receptor families, RAR and RXR, and each family includes α, β, and γ members (16De Luca L.M. FASEB J. 1991; 5: 2924-2933Crossref PubMed Scopus (816) Google Scholar). The RARs bind preferentially to all-trans-retinoic acid, while the RXRs bind to a stereoisomer, 9-cis-retinoic acid (17Allegretto E.A. McClurg M.R. Lazarchik S.B. Clemm D.L. Kerner S.A. Elgort M.G.

These receptors frequently exist as RAR/RXR heterodimers, although RXR homodimers may also form (18Chen Z.P. Iyer J. Bourguet W. Held P. Mioskowski C. Lebeau L. Noy N. Chambon P. Gronemeyer H. J.

Although retinoic acid has been shown to be a potent antineoplastic agent, side effects have limited its clinical usefulness. For this reason there is substantial interest in designing retinoids that have a better therapeutic index and in understanding how receptor-selective ligands influence cancer cell function. EGFR is an important regulator of cell proliferation that is expressed in many cell types (21Carpenter G. Cohen S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1979; 48: 193-216Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22Earp H.S.

Moreover, altered EGFR expression and function have been noted during initiation and progression in several cancer models (25DiGiovanni J. Rho O. Xian W. Beltran L. Prog. Clin. Biol. Res. 1994; 387: 113-138PubMed Google Scholar, 26Rusch V. Klimstra D. Linkov I. Dmitrovsky E. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 1365-1372PubMed Google Scholar, 27Voldborg B.R. Damstrup L. Spang-Thomsen M. Poulsen H.S. Ann. Oncol. 1997; 8: 1197-1206Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). For example, EGFR levels are increased in the majority of lung, vulval, and cervical carcinomas (28Gullick W.J. Marsden J.J. Whittle N. Ward B. Bobrow L. Waterfield M.D. Cancer Res. 1986; 46: 285-292PubMed Google Scholar). Based on these observations, inhibition of the activity of the EGFR and the downstream targets of EGFR is a major goal of anticancer therapy. Several anticancer drugs have been designed based on this principle (29Levitzki A. Gazit A. Science. 1995; 267: 1782-1788Crossref PubMed Scopus (1620) Google Scholar). Our previous studies show that EGFR levels are increased in cervical cells following human papillomavirus-dependent immortalization (12Sizemore N. Rorke E.A. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 4511-4517PubMed Google Scholar). This increase is associated with enhanced proliferation. Importantly EGFR levels can be returned to normal levels by retinoid treatment, and this reduction is correlated with reduced cell proliferation. Two questions are particularly important. First, which retinoid receptor subtype mediates the retinoid-dependent reduction in EGFR level. This information would be helpful for the design of the optimal therapeutic retinoid. In the present manuscript, we describe experiments that identify the RAR-selective retinoids as the most efficient regulators of EGFR level. Second, the mechanism responsible for the retinoid-dependent suppression of EGFR function is fundamentally important. We show here that RAR-specific retinoids selectively influence EGFR-dependent ERK1/2 activation but do not influence AKT, p38, or JNK activity. ECE16-1 cells are an immortalized line of human ectocervical epithelial cells derived by stable transfection with a plasmid encoding the complete HPV16 genome (12Sizemore N. Rorke E.A.

ECE16-1 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium:Ham's F-12 (3:1) supplemented as described previously (2Sizemore N. Kasturi L. Gorodeski G. Eckert R.L. Jetten A.M. Rorke E.A. Differentiation. 1993; 54: 219-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Briefly, the medium was supplemented with 4% fetal calf serum, 5 μg/ml insulin, 5 μg/ml transferrin, 1 nm T3, 10 ng/ml EGF, 0.18 nmadenine, nonessential amino acids, l-glutamine, and antibiotics (100 units/ml penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin). Retinoids were dissolved in Me2SO as 1000-fold concentrates and stored at −20 °C. For cell proliferation experiments, ECE16-1 cells were plated in 24-well plates at 10,000 cells/well in growth medium. Two days after plating, fresh medium was added in which the fetal calf serum was replaced with 0.4% delipidized fetal calf serum and the appropriate retinoid. EGF was always present unless stated otherwise. Fresh retinoid-containing medium was added on alternate days. Cells were harvested in triplicate with trypsin at the indicated times for counting using a Coulter counter. The ECE16-1 cells were treated with retinoids as described above. In the presence of the EGF ligand, the EGF receptor is activated, endocytosed, and finally degraded. Therefore, prior to measurement of EGFR level, cells were transferred to EGF-free medium (retinoids or vehicle were included) for 12–18 h to facilitate receptor measurement. To measure EGF binding,125I-EGF labeled by the chloramine-T method was added to 0.5 ml of treatment medium. After 3 h at 4 °C, the cells were washed with Hank's balanced salt solution and solubilized in 0.2n NaOH. The cell-associated radioactivity was counted in a γ counter. Nonspecific binding was determined from incubations in which a 1000-fold excess of unlabeled EGF was present. Nonspecific binding never exceeded 5% of total binding. ECE16-1 cells were plated in 12-well cluster dishes at 40,000 cells/well in growth medium and allowed to attach for 24 h. The cells were then transferred to a defined medium (DM) supplemented with 20 ng/ml EGF. DM is comprised of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium:Ham's F-12 (3:1) supplemented with 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, nonessential amino acids,l-glutamine, 5 μg/ml transferrin, 1 nmT3, 0.18 nm adenine, 50 μg/ml ascorbic acid, and antibiotics. After 24 h the cells were treated with the indicated retinoid or vehicle (0.1% Me2SO) for 48 h. Prior to measuring EGFR levels or activation, treatment was continued overnight in the absence of EGF. The cells were subsequently stimulated with 5 ng/ml EGF at 37 °C to activate EGFR for various lengths of time as indicated in the figure legends followed by lysis in Laemmli sample buffer at 106 cells/ml. Duplicate wells were used to estimate cell number. For all such experiments a control set of cells was included that underwent treatment in identical fashion with the exception of stimulation with EGF. Cell extracts were electrophoresed at 10,000 cell equivalents/lane on denaturing acrylamide gels. The separated proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes and incubated with primary antibody as recommended by the supplier. Binding of the primary antibody was detected using the appropriate horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody and chemiluminescent substrate (West Pico, Pierce). Densitometric analysis was performed using a Bio-Rad FluorS. ECE16-1 cells were plated at 5 × 105 cells/100-mm dish. After 24 h the cells were shifted to EGF-supplemented DM and treated with vehicle (Me2SO) or retinoid. Cells were subsequently harvested, washed in phosphate-buffered saline, and suspended in lysis buffer at 2 × 106 cells/ml (20 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 2.5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm sodium vanadate, 1 μg of leupeptin, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Phosphorylated ERK1/2 was immunoprecipitated from 200 μg of cell lysate with agarose bead-conjugated anti-phospho-ERK1/2. The beads were washed and then incubated in 50 μl of kinase buffer (25 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 5 mm β-glycerophosphate, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm sodium vanadate, and 10 mm MgCl2) supplemented with 200 μm ATP and 2 μg of ELK-1 fusion protein for 30 min at 30 °C. The reaction mixture was then electrophoresed on a denaturing polyacrylamide gel, transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, and probed with anti-phospho-ELK-1. We began by examining the effect of various receptor-selective retinoids on ECE16-1 cell proliferation. As shown in Fig.1 A, the natural pan-agonist t-RA and the RAR-selective ligands AGN190168 and TTNPB suppress ECE16-1 proliferation in a concentration-dependent fashion. In contrast, the RAR antagonist AGN193109 and the RXR-selective ligand SR11217 do not regulate cell proliferation. Further, as apparent from Fig. 1 B, the RAR-selective ligand-associated reduction in cell proliferation is associated with a concomitant reduction in125I-EGF binding. SR11217, the RXR-selective ligand, which does not affect cell proliferation, had no effect on125I-EGF binding. AGN193109, a retinoid inverse agonist, is known to reverse retinoid action in some cell types, including ECE16-1 (30Agarwal C. Chandraratna R.A. Johnson A.T. Rorke E.A. Eckert R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12209-12212Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 31Klein E.S. Pino M.E. Johnson A.T. Davies P.J. Nagpal S. Thacher S.M. Krasinski G. Chandraratna R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22692-22696Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). To further assess retinoid specificity, we compared the effect of treatment with increasing concentrations of the RAR-selective antagonist AGN193109 and the RXR agonist SR11217 on TTNPB-dependent responses. Fig. 1 C shows that treatment with 100 nm TTNPB suppresses cell proliferation and that AGN193109 causes a dose-dependent reversal of the TTNPB-mediated effect. Further, the AGN193109-dependent reversal of the TTNPB-dependent growth suppression is accompanied by restoration of 125I-EGF binding (Fig.1 D). As shown in Fig. 1 E, ECE16-1 cells treated with varying concentrations of TTNPB show a dose dependent inhibition of 125I-EGF binding, and this response is not reversed by treatment with 1000 nm SR11217. The reduction in 125I-EGF binding subsequent to treatment with RAR-specific ligands may be due either to a reduction in EGFR expression or a modification of the affinity of the receptor for ligand. The analysis presented in Fig.2 A shows that125I-EGF binding is directly related to the level of EGFR detected by immunoblot. The EGFR level is reduced by t-RA and the RAR-selective ligand TTNPB. In contrast, neither the RXR-selective ligand SR11217 nor the RAR antagonist AGN193109 influence EGFR levels. However, co-administration of the RAR antagonist with TTNPB at a concentration approaching the ED50 partially restores EGFR expression. SR11217, the RXR-selective agent, does not inhibit the TTNPB-dependent reduction in EGFR level. Upon activation, EGFR is autophosphorylated at specific tyrosine residues. To determine whether the change in receptor level is correlated with reduced receptor activation, lysates prepared from cells exposed to EGF for 5 min were probed with antibodies specific for phosphorylated EGFR or phosphorylated tyrosine. In both cases, a phosphorylated 170-kDa band corresponding to the activated form of EGFR was detected (Fig.2 B). The intensity of this band is markedly reduced when ECE16-1 cells are cotreated with t-RA or TTNPB. However, SR11217 and AGN193109 do not cause reduced phosphorylation. Densitometric analysis reveals that the decreased level of phosphorylated receptor parallels the decreased total cellular level of EGFR. Moreover, Fig.2 C shows that the reduction in EGFR function is associated with reduced cell proliferation. The MAPK and AKT signaling cascades are downstream targets of EGFR. Prior to evaluating the effects of EGF and retinoid treatment on these downstream effectors, we determined whether retinoid treatment influences their endogenous expression. As shown in Fig. 2 D, retinoids do not influence total ERK, AKT, p38, or SAPK/JNK levels. We next examined the effect of retinoid treatment on the EGFR-associated activation of ERK1/2, JNK, AKT, and p38 in ECE16-1 cells. Fig. 3 shows the effects of RAR treatment of ECE16-1 cells in the absence (Fig. 3 A) or presence (Fig. 3 B) of EGF. An examination of all the blots that make up Fig. 3 A reveals no effect of retinoid treatment on MAPK activity in the absence of EGF. That is, baseline MAPK cascade activity is not influenced by retinoid treatment. As shown in Fig. 3 B, stimulation with EGF causes an increase in the level of phosphorylated (activated) ERK, p38, JNK, and AKT (compare control lane in Fig. 3 B withcontrol lane in Fig. 3 A). The RAR-selective ligands (t-RA and TTNPB) inhibit the activation of ERK1/2 by 50%, but SR11217 and AGN193109 do not reduce the EGF-dependent activation. However, AGN193109 does block the inhibitory effect of TTNPB on EGF-dependent ERK activation. Thus, retinoids produce parallel changes in EGFR and ERK. None of the retinoids influenced the EGF-dependent AKT, p38, or SAPK/JNK activation. Further examination of the effect of retinoids on EGF-dependent ERK1/2 activity was performed using a kinase assay. Fig. 4 A shows that although total ERK1/2 levels are not bx;1affected, ERK1/2 activity, as measured by its ability to phosphorylate ELK-1, is reduced by treatment with t-RA or TTNPB. The RXR-specific ligand is without effect, and the antagonist AGN193109, when administered with TTNPB, restores ERK1/2 kinase activity. As shown in Fig. 4 B, the reduced ERK1/2 activity is directly reflected in reduced cell proliferation. The duration of the ERK activation is thought to play a pivotal role in regulating cell proliferation. Sustained ERK activation is part of the required response for G1 phase progression (32Roovers K. Assoian R.K. Bioessays. 2000; 22: 818-826Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar). We therefore monitored the level of activated EGFR and ERK with time. In these experiments, EGF was removed from the medium for 12 h prior to assay to permit receptor levels to stabilize. Fig.5 A shows that EGFR, as measured by formation of P-EGFR, remains activated for 8 h after EGF treatment in the absence of retinoid treatment (Fig.5 A, Control). However, the magnitude and duration of the EGF-dependent activity is reduced by t-RA or TTNBP treatment. The level of activity is reduced by 50%, and the response terminates 4 h earlier. This change is reflected at the level of ERK activation. In the presence of t-RA or TTNPB, maximal ERK1/2 activation is one-half that observed in control cells (Fig.5 A, P-ERK1/2). Moreover, the second peak of ERK activity, observed at 36 h, is absent in the retinoid-treated cells. Sustained ERK activation results in increased cyclin D1 expression, which contributes to G1 phase progression and cell proliferation. To determine whether retinoids influence the EGF-dependent increase in cyclin D1, we measured cyclin D1 levels in EGF-treated cells in the presence or absence of retinoid treatment. In the absence of retinoid treatment, cyclin D1 levels were markedly increased at 24 and 36 h after EGF treatment (Fig.5 B). However, the presence of t-RA or TTNBP markedly attenuated this response. Further, neither t-RA- nor TTNPB-treated cells show a change in cell number during the first 24 h after EGF stimulation. During the same time period, control cell number increased by 22% (Fig. 5 C). This represents a substantial increase considering the brief time period. The importance of the EGFR-dependent ERK activation was further examined by comparing the effects of retinoids, inhibitors of the EGF receptor kinase, and inhibitors of MEK1/2 on cell proliferation and ERK1/2 activity. AG1478, a specific inhibitor of the EGFR tyrosine kinase, and U0126, a specific inhibitor of MEK1/2 kinase, were used. As is evident in Fig. 6 A, both AG1478 and U0126 suppress cell proliferation within 24 h (the earliest time point examined), suggesting that ECE16-1 cells require EGFR-dependent ERK activation to proliferate. Consistent with this observation is the fact that ECE16-1 cells do not proliferate when EGF is withdrawn from the medium (DM). t-RA and the RAR-selective ligand TTNPB also inhibit cell proliferation. However, the onset of growth inhibition is delayed. This time difference is most likely due to mechanistic differences; unlike the kinase inhibitors that immediately bind to and inactivate either EGFR or MEK1/2, retinoids act through the reduction of EGFR protein levels. We also cultured ECE16-1 cells in the absence of EGF to provide a measure of ERK1/2 activity in resting, growth-arrested cells (Fig.6 B, DM). ECE16-1 cells grown under these conditions display detectable ERK1/2 activity. This activity is increased 2.5-fold in the presence of EGF (Fig. 6 B). ERK activation in cells treated in the presence of EGF plus either retinoids or the MEK1/2 inhibitor U0126 was significantly less that that found in EGF treated cells but higher than in growth arrested cells. Only AG1478 inhibited ERK1/2 activation below the level observed in nonproliferating cells. These alterations represent real changes in activity as total ERK1/2 levels were not altered (Fig. 6 B,ERK1/2). As a final experiment to show that the retinoid regulation of ERK1/2 activity requires EGF, we grew cells in the absence of EGF and monitored cell number, EGFR level, EGFR activity, and ERK1/2 activity. The results shown in Fig. 6 C indicate that the cells do not proliferate in the absence of EGF nor is cell number suppressed by retinoid treatment of EGF-free cultures. Fig. 6 D shows that retinoid treatment of EGF-free cultures lowers EGFR level as observed in EGF-treated cultures. However, because no EGF is present, no active EGFR (Fig. 6 D, P-EGFR) is detected. This absence of activated EGFR is associated with an absence of retinoid regulation of ERK1/2 (Fig. 6 D,P-ERK1/2) by retinoids. EGFR overexpression and activation is observed in many epithelial cancers, including cervical cancer (25DiGiovanni J. Rho O. Xian W. Beltran L. Prog. Clin. Biol. Res. 1994; 387: 113-138PubMed Google Scholar, 26Rusch V. Klimstra D. Linkov I. Dmitrovsky E. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 1365-1372PubMed Google Scholar, 27Voldborg B.R. Damstrup L. Spang-Thomsen M. Poulsen H.S. Ann. Oncol. 1997; 8: 1197-1206Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). This increased EGFR expression is not due to gene amplification (33Merlino G.T. Xu Y.H. Ishii S. Clark A.J. Semba K. Toyoshima K. Yamamoto T. Pastan I. Science. 1984; 224: 417-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). In disease, EGFR levels are regulated by a number of factors, including viral oncogenes. For example, expression of the HPV16 E6/E7 oncoproteins in ECE16-1 cells results in a 3–5-fold increase in EGFR level (12Sizemore N. Rorke E.A. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 4511-4517PubMed Google Scholar). This increased EGFR is associated with enhanced cell proliferation. Conversely treatment of E6/E7-positive cell lines from established cervical tumors with E6/E7 antisense leads to diminished EGFR expression and reduced cell proliferation (for a review, see Ref. 34Rorke E.A. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1997; 89: 1243-1246Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). In the present study, we used ECE16-1, an established HPV16-immortalized cell line, to study the role of retinoids as regulators of EGFR-dependent signaling and cell proliferation. These cells are known to overexpress EGFR (12Sizemore N. Rorke E.A. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 4511-4517PubMed Google Scholar). Retinoids are a family of ligands that produce changes in cell function via interaction with ligand-activated nuclear receptors (35Chambon P. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 940-954Crossref PubMed Scopus (2604) Google Scholar). These receptors belong to two classes, the RARs and RXRs. Each receptor class includes an α, β, and γ isoform (16De Luca L.M. FASEB J. 1991; 5: 2924-2933Crossref PubMed Scopus (816) Google Scholar). An important goal is the identification of receptor-selective ligands that interact with specific members of these families for use in cancer treatment. Thus, it is important to identify the retinoid receptor subtype that is important for clinical response (36Nagpal S. Chandraratna R.A. Curr. Pharm. Des. 2000; 6: 919-931Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Clinically retinoids promote cervical tumor regression when administered in combination with interferon α (37Lippman S.M. Glisson B.S. Kavanagh J.J. Lotan R. Hong W.K. Paredes-Espinoza M. Hittelman W.N. Holdener E.E. Krakoff I.H. Eur. J. Cancer. 1993; 29A: S9-S13Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). However, it is not known whether ligands that interact selectively with the RAR or RXR or with specific subtypes within these families are more efficacious. Our previous studies show that naturally occurring retinoids, including all-trans-retinoic acid, suppress the growth of immortalized and transformed cervical cells, including ECE16-1 cells, while having no effect on normal cervical cell growth (2Sizemore N. Kasturi L. Gorodeski G. Eckert R.L. Jetten A.M. Rorke E.A. Differentiation. 1993; 54: 219-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 12Sizemore N. Rorke E.A. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 4511-4517PubMed Google Scholar, 38Agarwal C. Chandraratna R.A. Teng M. Nagpal S. Rorke E.A. Eckert R.L. Cell Growth Differ. 1996; 7: 521-530PubMed Google Scholar, 39Gorodeski G.I. Eckert R.L. Utian W.H. Sheean L. Rorke E.A. Differentiation. 1989; 42: 75-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Moreover, in some HPV-immortalized cells, t-RA inhibition of cell growth is associated with reduced HPV E6/E7 levels (40Pirisi L. Batova A. Jenkins G.R. Hodam J.R. Creek K.E. Cancer Res. 1992; 52: 187-193PubMed Google Scholar). However, E6/E7 oncogene expression is not altered by retinoid treatment of ECE16-1 cells (11Agarwal C. Hembree J.R. Rorke E.A. Eckert R.L. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 2108-2112PubMed Google Scholar). Instead retinoid-dependent ECE16-1 growth inhibition is associated with a reduction in EGFR level (12Sizemore N. Rorke E.A. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 4511-4517PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting the involvement of EGFR in this process. ECE16-1 cells express the RARα and RXRα receptors and, to a lesser extent, RARγ receptors (41Darwiche N. Celli G. De Luca L.M. Endocrinology. 1994; 134: 2018-2025Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), and RARβ expression is increased by retinoid treatment (38Agarwal C. Chandraratna R.A. Teng M. Nagpal S. Rorke E.A. Eckert R.L. Cell Growth Differ. 1996; 7: 521-530PubMed Google Scholar). However, although our previous studies demonstrate that retinoid receptor pan-agonists, agents that interact with both RAR and RXR subclasses, suppress EGFR function, we do not know which receptor class is responsible for this regulation. Thus, our present studies have compared the effects of RAR- and RXR-selective ligands on EGFR function, EGFR-dependent signal transduction, and cell proliferation. Our present studies show that the reduction in cell proliferation and the reduction in EGFR level and activation are mediated by RAR-selective ligands. Additional evidence indicates that an RAR antagonist, AGN193109, reverses the RAR ligand-dependent suppression of EGFR level. The RAR-selective ligands tested include a pan-RAR pan-agonist, TTNBP, and an RARα, β-selective agonist, AGN190168 (31Klein E.S. Pino M.E. Johnson A.T. Davies P.J. Nagpal S. Thacher S.M. Krasinski G. Chandraratna R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22692-22696Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). The fact that AGN190168 is active suggests that the RARα and RARβ receptors are sufficient for growth inhibition and reduced EGFR expression. In contrast, the RXR ligands do not appear to effect EGFR expression or cell proliferation. RXR ligands can, however, antagonize RAR activity, and this effect is thought to occur when RXRs form homodimers, limiting the RXR available to form RAR/RXR heterodimers (18Chen Z.P. Iyer J. Bourguet W. Held P. Mioskowski C. Lebeau L. Noy N. Chambon P. Gronemeyer H. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 275: 55-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 19Kersten S. Gronemeyer H. Noy N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12771-12777Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 20Laudet V. J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 19: 207-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar). Such an effect is observed in ECE16-1 cells for regulation of insulin-like growth factor binding protein-3 expression (42Hembree J.R. Agarwal C. Beard R.L. Chandraratna R.A. Eckert R. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 1794-1799PubMed Google Scholar); however, in the present experiments no RXR-selective ligand-dependent inhibition of the RAR activity is observed for EGFR-mediated events. This appears to rule out an independent role for RXRs in the regulation of EGFR function. Previous characterization of the ECE16-1 cell response to retinoids reveals a loss of EGF cell surface-localized binding in the absence of changes in receptor affinity or internalization (12Sizemore N. Rorke E.A. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 4511-4517PubMed Google Scholar). This suggests that the growth inhibition induced by retinoids is not due to changes in EGFR affinity, altered endocytosis, or altered subcellular localization. This leaves altered downstream signaling as a possible mechanism to explain the response. The MAPK and AKT cascades are major routes for EGF-dependent intracellular signal transfer (43Carpenter G. Bioessays. 2000; 22: 697-707Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar, 44Yarden Y. Eur. J. Cancer. 2001; 37: 3-8Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The MAPK cascades include ERK1/2, JNK/SAPK, and p38. We therefore examined how the retinoid-dependent reduction in EGFR level influences these downstream events. Our results indicate that the retinoid-dependent reduction in EGFR level and activity is associated with selective changes in cell signaling pathways. For example, p38, JNK, and AKT activity is not altered by retinoid treatment. EGF produces a significant increase in the activity of these kinases, but this activation is not influenced by co-administration of retinoids. Our studies show that EGF markedly increases ERK1/2 activity and that this increase is inhibited by RAR-selective retinoids. Thus, the RAR-selective ligand TTNPB inhibits this activation. AGN193109, a RAR-selective antagonist, inhibits the retinoid-dependent suppression. This result and the absence of regulation by the RXR-selective retinoids supports the hypothesis that EGF-dependent cervical cell proliferation is mediated by RAR-selective ligands. Biphasic ERK activation is abolished in RAR-selective ligand-treated cells as is cyclin D1 induction. The absence of the cyclin D1 induction is particularly interesting as sustained ERK activation is thought to be necessary for induction of cyclin D1 levels, and increased cyclin D1 expression is, in turn, required for cell proliferation (45Cowley S. Paterson H. Kemp P. Marshall C.J. Cell. 1994; 77: 841-852Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1853) Google Scholar). A biphasic pattern of ERK activation was initially described in fibroblasts where it was demonstrated that activation at later times correlated with enhanced mitogenic capacity (46Meloche S. Seuwen K. Pages G. Pouyssegur J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1992; 6: 845-854Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This later phase of ERK signaling, which is absent in retinoid-treated ECE16-1 cells, may be required for cyclin D1 induction that leads to increased cdk4/6 activation and G1 progression (32Roovers K. Assoian R.K. Bioessays. 2000; 22: 818-826Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar). Therefore, the retinoid-dependent reduction in EGFR expression and ERK1/2 activation may be sufficient to attenuate the ability of EGF to stimulate ECE16-1 cell proliferation. Induction of apoptosis could play a role in the decreased proliferation of ECE16-1 cells in response to retinoids as downstream effectors of the EGFR signaling have been implicated in apoptosis (47Peus D. Vasa R.A. Meves A. Beyerle A. Pittelkow M.R. Photochem. Photobiol. 2000; 72: 135-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The proapoptotic responses appear to be mediated via SAPK/JNK and p38 (48Xia Z. Dickens M. Raingeaud J. Davis R.J. Greenberg M.E. Science. 1995; 270: 1326-1331Crossref PubMed Scopus (5036) Google Scholar), while activated AKT is antiapoptotic (49Wang X. McCullough K.D. Franke T.F. Holbrook N.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14624-14631Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar). Moreover, AKT may cooperate with phospho-ERK to negate the proapoptotic effect of activated JNK and p38. Flow cytometric analysis reveals no significant retinoid-dependent apoptosis in ECE16-1 cells (data not shown), a finding that is consistent with an absence of retinoid-dependent effects on AKT, JNK, and p38 activity. In summary, we hypothesize that the RAR ligand-selective activation of RAR inhibits EGF-dependent ECE16-1 proliferation via a mechanism that involves reduced EGFR expression/activity. This, in turn, results in a reduced activation of ERK1/2 kinase and reduced cyclin D1 expression."
https://openalex.org/W2105771297,"In the first-trimester mammalian fetus, skin wounds heal with perfect reconstitution of the dermal architecture without scar formation. Understanding environmental molecular regulation in fetal wound healing may reveal scar-limiting therapeutical strategies for the prevention of postnatal scarring wound repair. Therefore, we performed studies on fetal skin oxygenation and skin and wound expression of hypoxia-inducible factor 1alpha (HIF-1alpha) in the sheep model in vivo and performed studies on the potential relevance of HIF-1alpha during wound healing in vitro. Skin oxygen partial pressure levels were hypoxic throughout normal development. In nonscarring fetal skin at gestation day (GD)60, HIF-1alpha could be detected neither in healthy nor in wounded tissue. At GD100, in wounds with minimal scar formation, HIF-1alpha was expressed in fibroblasts and was markedly up-regulated at the wound edge. In scarring fetal wounds at GD120, HIF-1alpha was predominantly expressed in inflammatory cells. Expression of transforming growth factor beta3 (TGF-beta3), a potent antiscarring cytokine, overlapped with HIF-1a expression at GD100. HIF-1alpha-deficient mouse embryonic fibroblasts showed impaired migratory capabilities and demonstrated that TGF-beta3, but not proscarring TGF-beta1, manifests hypoxia- and HIF-1alpha-dependent regulation. In conclusion, HIF-1alpha-dependent regulation of a potent antiscarring cytokine may provide new strategies for antiscarring manipulation of wound healing."

Provided to neurons by neighboring astrocytes, these amino acids are internalized by classical system A amino acid carriers. In particular, System A transporter (SAT1) is a highly efficient glutamine transporter, whereas SAT2 exhibits broad specificity for neutral amino acids with a preference for alanine. We investigated the localization and the functional relevance of SAT1 and SAT2 in primary cultures of hippocampal neurons. Both carriers have been expressed since early developmental stages and are uniformly distributed throughout all neuronal processes. However, whereas SAT1 is present in axonal growth cones and can be detected at later developmental stages at the sites of synaptic contacts, SAT2 does not appear to be significantly expressed in these compartments. The non-metabolizable amino acid analogue α-(methylamino)-isobutyric acid, a competitive inhibitor of system A carriers, significantly reduced miniature excitatory postsynaptic current amplitude in neurons growing on top of astrocytes, being ineffective in pure neuronal cultures. α-(Methylamino)-isobutyric acid did not alter neuronal responsitivity to glutamate, thus excluding a postsynaptic effect. These data indicate that system A carriers are expressed with a different subcellular distribution in hippocampal neurons and play a crucial role in controlling the astrocyte-mediated supply of glutamatergic neurons with neurotransmitter precursors.

Nutr. 1995; 15: 133-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (509) Google Scholar) are collectively referred to as “the glutamate-glutamine cycle.” The recent identification of SAT1 as the first member of the system A family of neutral amino acid transporters, specifically localized on neuronal cells and endowed with a high efficiency in glutamine transport, has provided a missing link in the glutamate-glutamine cycle (18Varoqui H. Zhu H. Yao D. Ming H. Erickson J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4049-4054Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). The supply of α-ketoglutarate and alanine from glial cells also contributes to the neurotransmitter synthesis through the conversion to glutamate via an aminooxyacetic acid-inhibitable transamination reaction (11Kihara M. Kubo T. J. Neurochem. 1988; 52: 1127-1134Crossref Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 12Yu A.C.H. Drejer J. Hertz L. Schousboe A. J. Neurochem. 1983; 41: 1484-1487Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). The expression of a second member of the system A family, SAT2, in neurons has revealed a second possible gateway for astrocyte-derived glutamate precursors (21Yao D. Mackenzie B. Ming H. Varoqui H. Zhu H. Hediger M.A. Erickson J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 22790-22797Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar).We have investigated the expression, subcellular distribution, and functional role of SAT1 and SAT2 in cultured hippocampal neurons. Our results indicated a neuron-specific expression of these carriers from early developmental stages. In both developing and mature neurons, SAT1 and SAT2 were present in all neuronal compartments including axons. However, whereas SAT2 staining was uniformly distributed in neuronal processes, SAT1 immunoreactivity had a slightly clustered appearance as described previously for the glutamate transporter excitatory amino acid carrier 1 (28Coco S. Verderio C. Trotti D. Rothstein J.D. Volterra A. Matteoli M. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1997; 9: 1902-1910Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). SAT1-positive hotspots may represent surface clusters of transporters and/or intracellular pools of the protein. The existence of intracellular pools of carriers that has been previously demonstrated for other neurotransmitter transporters (28Coco S. Verderio C. Trotti D. Rothstein J.D. Volterra A. Matteoli M. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1997; 9: 1902-1910Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar,39Buckley K.M. Melikian H.E. Provoda C.J. Waring M.T. J J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2000; 525: 11-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 40Blakely R.D. Bauman A.L. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2000; 10: 328-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar) might open the possibility of a regulated recruitment of these carriers to the neuronal surface. Interestingly, only SAT1 was found to be present in the leading edge of axonal growth cones and at later developmental stages could be detected at the sites of synaptic contacts. In this respect, SAT2 and even more prominently SAT1 differ from the neuronal glutamate carrier excitatory amino acid carrier 1, which is excluded from the axon since early stages of neuronal development and is restricted to the dendritic shaft and spine neck in fully differentiated neurons (28Coco S. Verderio C. Trotti D. Rothstein J.D. Volterra A. Matteoli M. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1997; 9: 1902-1910Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). No significant difference in the carriers' distribution was detected in neurons growing in contact with astrocytes when compared with neurons growing in astrocyte-conditioned medium.The presence of system A carriers in glutamatergic neurons and in particular the localization of SAT1 at sites of synaptic contacts provide a strategic anatomical basis for a functional role of these transporters in synaptic function. In agreement with this possibility, the specific inhibitor of neutral amino acid transport system A, MeAIB, was found to reduce mEPSC amplitude in hippocampal neurons growing on top of astrocytes. Because no difference in receptor responsivity to glutamate was detected in the presence of MeAIB, we propose that the MeAIB-mediated reduction in mEPSC amplitude is consequent to a diminished amount of glutamate in synaptic vesicles produced by the inhibition of the astrocyte-mediated feeding of glutamine and/or alanine. Accordingly with this possibility, mEPSC amplitude was significantly higher in neurons growing on top of glial cells as compared with pure neuronal cultures. Furthermore, MeAIB specifically reduced mEPSC amplitude in neurons growing on top of astrocytes, being ineffective in neurons devoid of glial cells. Although MeAIB treatment does not allow evaluation of the relative contribution of SAT1 and SAT2, the synaptic localization of SAT1 might suggest a more prominent relevance of this transporter. In support of this possibility, it has been shown in hippocampal preparations, glutamate derived from glutamine is preferentially secreted at glutamatergic synapses (41Bradford H.F. Ward H.K. Thomas A.J. Brain Res. 1976; 110: 115-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 42Hamberger A.C. Han Chiang G. Nylen E.S. Scheff S.W. Cotman C.W.

Liss, New York1983: 219-227Google Scholar), and the relative affinity of SAT1 for glutamine is higher than that for SAT2 (18Varoqui H. Zhu H. Yao D. Ming H. Erickson J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4049-4054Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar, 21Yao D. Mackenzie B. Ming H. Varoqui H. Zhu H. Hediger M.A. Erickson J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 22790-22797Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). In addition, intracellular perfusion with glutamine of single neurons growing in microislands but not of neurons in multineuronal networks led to a significant enhancement in mEPSC amplitude. 2S. Armano and M. Matteoli, unpublished observation. A reduction of glutamate content in synaptic vesicles has been shown to decrease not only the amplitude but also the frequency of mEPSCs (32Zhou Q. Petersen C.C.H. Nicoll R.A. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2000; 525: 195-206Crossref Scopus (179) Google Scholar). In apparent contrast, MeAIB treatment induced an increase in mEPSC frequency both in pure neuronal cultures and in neurons growing on top of glial cells. Because MeAIB is co-transported with Na+ions, we hypothesize that the resulting Na+ load could drive Ca2+ influx through the Na+/Ca2+ exchanger. A similar process has been shown to occur during recovery from intracellular acidification when the activity of the Na+/H+ exchanger rises the intracellular Na+ concentration and leads to enhanced neurotransmitter release consequent to the Ca2+ influx driven by the Na+/Ca2+ exchanger (33Trudeau L.E. Parpura V. Haydon P.G. J. Neurophysiol. 1999; 81: 2627-2635Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Our data support this possibility as the Na+/Ca2+exchanger inhibitor dimethylbenzamil prevented the increase in mEPSC frequency in pure neuronal cultures. Interestingly, when the astrocyte-neuron co-cultures were pre-incubated with the Na+/Ca2+ exchanger inhibitor, a clear effect of MeAIB in reducing mEPSC frequency was unmasked, thus indicating that the block of glutamine transport in neurons associated with glial cells diminishes both mEPSC frequency and amplitude. These observations raise the possibility that during intense neuronal activity, the symport of Na+ ions together with glutamine and/or alanine through SAT1 or SAT2 transporters may directly contribute in driving the Ca2+ influx leading to an increase in mEPSC frequency.Our data reveal a novel mechanism by which astrocytes may influence glutamatergic function. It is now widely established that astrocytes profoundly affect neuronal and synaptic function. Glial cells increase the number of mature functional synapses in central nervous system neurons (30Ullian E.M. Sapperstein S.K. Christopherson K.S. Barres B.A. Science. 2001; 291: 657-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (1042) Google Scholar) and also enhance synaptic efficacy by both postsynaptic and presynaptic mechanisms (44Pfrieger F.W. Barres B.A. Science. 1997; 277: 1684-1687Crossref PubMed Scopus (604) Google Scholar). Although astrocytes may directly influence the clustering and/or the functionality of glutamate receptors or even modulate the extent of vesicle recycling at the presynaptic terminal, our data indicate that the enhancement of synaptic efficacy may be at least partially achieved through the replenishment of glutamate into synaptic vesicles. Interestingly, it has been shown recently that reducing the glutamate content of synaptic vesicles results in the formation of partially filled vesicles, which undergo release with normal probability (32Zhou Q. Petersen C.C.H. Nicoll R.A. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2000; 525: 195-206Crossref Scopus (179) Google Scholar). These data have led to the conclusion that the mechanisms involved in controlling the release of synaptic vesicles are not dependent on the state of filling of synaptic vesicles themselves. The role of glial cells to directly influence the amount of presynaptic neurotransmitter glutamate is therefore of significant interest in normal and pathophysiological synaptic transmission in the central nervous system. Under this respect, it is notable that the frequency of spontaneous epileptiform discharges, induced in hippocampal slices by γ-aminobutyric acid antagonists, are strongly reduced by the block of glutamine and alanine uptake in neurons. 3A. Bacci, G. Sancini, S. Armano, C. Verderio, S. Franceschetti, and M. Matteoli, unpublished results. Therefore, the neuron-astrocyte coupling could mediate through the restoration of the presynaptic glutamate pool a plastic form of bidirectional communication, eventually leading to an enhancement of synaptic transmission in the long term range. Glial cells, which represent a large percentage of the cell population in the brain, are intimately juxtaposed to neurons throughout the nervous system. Once considered as a purely structurally supportive element for neurons, astrocytes are now recognized as active neuronal partners, which participate in the formation of the synapse and dynamically control neuronal activity and synaptic transmission (1Pfrieger F.W.

To evaluate the roles SAT1 and SAT2 play as molecular gateways to provide precursors for the synthesis of glutamate in neuronal cells, we have investigated their distribution and function in primary cultures of developing hippocampal neurons, a widely used model for the study of glutamatergic transmission. DISCUSSIONThe metabolic dependence of glutamatergic neurons upon glia via glutamine and alanine supply to provide the precursor for the neurotransmitter glutamate is widely established.

Nutr. 1995; 15: 133-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (509) Google Scholar) are collectively referred to as “the glutamate-glutamine cycle.” The recent identification of SAT1 as the first member of the system A family of neutral amino acid transporters, specifically localized on neuronal cells and endowed with a high efficiency in glutamine transport, has provided a missing link in the glutamate-glutamine cycle (18Varoqui H. Zhu H. Yao D. Ming H. Erickson J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4049-4054Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). The supply of α-ketoglutarate and alanine from glial cells also contributes to the neurotransmitter synthesis through the conversion to glutamate via an aminooxyacetic acid-inhibitable transamination reaction (11Kihara M. Kubo T. J. Neurochem. 1988; 52: 1127-1134Crossref Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 12Yu A.C.H. Drejer J. Hertz L. Schousboe A. J. Neurochem. 1983; 41: 1484-1487Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). The expression of a second member of the system A family, SAT2, in neurons has revealed a second possible gateway for astrocyte-derived glutamate precursors (21Yao D. Mackenzie B. Ming H. Varoqui H. Zhu H. Hediger M.A. Erickson J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 22790-22797Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar).We have investigated the expression, subcellular distribution, and functional role of SAT1 and SAT2 in cultured hippocampal neurons. Our results indicated a neuron-specific expression of these carriers from early developmental stages. In both developing and mature neurons, SAT1 and SAT2 were present in all neuronal compartments including axons. However, whereas SAT2 staining was uniformly distributed in neuronal processes, SAT1 immunoreactivity had a slightly clustered appearance as described previously for the glutamate transporter excitatory amino acid carrier 1 (28Coco S. Verderio C. Trotti D. Rothstein J.D. Volterra A. Matteoli M. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1997; 9: 1902-1910Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). SAT1-positive hotspots may represent surface clusters of transporters and/or intracellular pools of the protein. The existence of intracellular pools of carriers that has been previously demonstrated for other neurotransmitter transporters (28Coco S. Verderio C. Trotti D. Rothstein J.D. Volterra A. Matteoli M. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1997; 9: 1902-1910Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar,39Buckley K.M. Melikian H.E. Provoda C.J. Waring M.T. J J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2000; 525: 11-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 40Blakely R.D. Bauman A.L. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2000; 10: 328-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar) might open the possibility of a regulated recruitment of these carriers to the neuronal surface. Interestingly, only SAT1 was found to be present in the leading edge of axonal growth cones and at later developmental stages could be detected at the sites of synaptic contacts. In this respect, SAT2 and even more prominently SAT1 differ from the neuronal glutamate carrier excitatory amino acid carrier 1, which is excluded from the axon since early stages of neuronal development and is restricted to the dendritic shaft and spine neck in fully differentiated neurons (28Coco S. Verderio C. Trotti D. Rothstein J.D. Volterra A. Matteoli M. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1997; 9: 1902-1910Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). No significant difference in the carriers' distribution was detected in neurons growing in contact with astrocytes when compared with neurons growing in astrocyte-conditioned medium.The presence of system A carriers in glutamatergic neurons and in particular the localization of SAT1 at sites of synaptic contacts provide a strategic anatomical basis for a functional role of these transporters in synaptic function. In agreement with this possibility, the specific inhibitor of neutral amino acid transport system A, MeAIB, was found to reduce mEPSC amplitude in hippocampal neurons growing on top of astrocytes. Because no difference in receptor responsivity to glutamate was detected in the presence of MeAIB, we propose that the MeAIB-mediated reduction in mEPSC amplitude is consequent to a diminished amount of glutamate in synaptic vesicles produced by the inhibition of the astrocyte-mediated feeding of glutamine and/or alanine. Accordingly with this possibility, mEPSC amplitude was significantly higher in neurons growing on top of glial cells as compared with pure neuronal cultures. Furthermore, MeAIB specifically reduced mEPSC amplitude in neurons growing on top of astrocytes, being ineffective in neurons devoid of glial cells. Although MeAIB treatment does not allow evaluation of the relative contribution of SAT1 and SAT2, the synaptic localization of SAT1 might suggest a more prominent relevance of this transporter. In support of this possibility, it has been shown in hippocampal preparations, glutamate derived from glutamine is preferentially secreted at glutamatergic synapses (41Bradford H.F. Ward H.K. Thomas A.J. Brain Res. 1976; 110: 115-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 42Hamberger A.C. Han Chiang G. Nylen E.S. Scheff S.W. Cotman C.W.

Liss, New York1983: 219-227Google Scholar), and the relative affinity of SAT1 for glutamine is higher than that for SAT2 (18Varoqui H. Zhu H. Yao D. Ming H. Erickson J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4049-4054Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar, 21Yao D. Mackenzie B. Ming H. Varoqui H. Zhu H. Hediger M.A. Erickson J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 22790-22797Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). In addition, intracellular perfusion with glutamine of single neurons growing in microislands but not of neurons in multineuronal networks led to a significant enhancement in mEPSC amplitude. 2S. Armano and M. Matteoli, unpublished observation. A reduction of glutamate content in synaptic vesicles has been shown to decrease not only the amplitude but also the frequency of mEPSCs (32Zhou Q. Petersen C.C.H. Nicoll R.A. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2000; 525: 195-206Crossref Scopus (179) Google Scholar). In apparent contrast, MeAIB treatment induced an increase in mEPSC frequency both in pure neuronal cultures and in neurons growing on top of glial cells. Because MeAIB is co-transported with Na+ions, we hypothesize that the resulting Na+ load could drive Ca2+ influx through the Na+/Ca2+ exchanger. A similar process has been shown to occur during recovery from intracellular acidification when the activity of the Na+/H+ exchanger rises the intracellular Na+ concentration and leads to enhanced neurotransmitter release consequent to the Ca2+ influx driven by the Na+/Ca2+ exchanger (33Trudeau L.E. Parpura V. Haydon P.G. J. Neurophysiol. 1999; 81: 2627-2635Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Our data support this possibility as the Na+/Ca2+exchanger inhibitor dimethylbenzamil prevented the increase in mEPSC frequency in pure neuronal cultures. Interestingly, when the astrocyte-neuron co-cultures were pre-incubated with the Na+/Ca2+ exchanger inhibitor, a clear effect of MeAIB in reducing mEPSC frequency was unmasked, thus indicating that the block of glutamine transport in neurons associated with glial cells diminishes both mEPSC frequency and amplitude. These observations raise the possibility that during intense neuronal activity, the symport of Na+ ions together with glutamine and/or alanine through SAT1 or SAT2 transporters may directly contribute in driving the Ca2+ influx leading to an increase in mEPSC frequency.Our data reveal a novel mechanism by which astrocytes may influence glutamatergic function. It is now widely established that astrocytes profoundly affect neuronal and synaptic function. Glial cells increase the number of mature functional synapses in central nervous system neurons (30Ullian E.M. Sapperstein S.K. Christopherson K.S. Barres B.A. Science. 2001; 291: 657-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (1042) Google Scholar) and also enhance synaptic efficacy by both postsynaptic and presynaptic mechanisms (44Pfrieger F.W. Barres B.A. Science. 1997; 277: 1684-1687Crossref PubMed Scopus (604) Google Scholar). Although astrocytes may directly influence the clustering and/or the functionality of glutamate receptors or even modulate the extent of vesicle recycling at the presynaptic terminal, our data indicate that the enhancement of synaptic efficacy may be at least partially achieved through the replenishment of glutamate into synaptic vesicles. Interestingly, it has been shown recently that reducing the glutamate content of synaptic vesicles results in the formation of partially filled vesicles, which undergo release with normal probability (32Zhou Q. Petersen C.C.H. Nicoll R.A. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2000; 525: 195-206Crossref Scopus (179) Google Scholar). These data have led to the conclusion that the mechanisms involved in controlling the release of synaptic vesicles are not dependent on the state of filling of synaptic vesicles themselves. The role of glial cells to directly influence the amount of presynaptic neurotransmitter glutamate is therefore of significant interest in normal and pathophysiological synaptic transmission in the central nervous system. Under this respect, it is notable that the frequency of spontaneous epileptiform discharges, induced in hippocampal slices by γ-aminobutyric acid antagonists, are strongly reduced by the block of glutamine and alanine uptake in neurons. 3A. Bacci, G. Sancini, S. Armano, C. Verderio, S. Franceschetti, and M. Matteoli, unpublished results. Therefore, the neuron-astrocyte coupling could mediate through the restoration of the presynaptic glutamate pool a plastic form of bidirectional communication, eventually leading to an enhancement of synaptic transmission in the long term range.

Hepatitis B virus (HBV)1 is a hepatotropic virus containing a partially double-stranded circular DNA genome that causes both acute and chronic hepatic injuries. Persistent HBV infection is strongly associated with the development of hepatocellular carcinoma (1Ganem D. Varmus H.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1987; 56: 651-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (813) Google Scholar). The compact 3.2-kbp genome contains enhancers and multiple promoters that are regulated by the cellular transcription machinery. HBV encodes a single known regulatory polypeptide, called pX (or HBx). pX is likely to be an important regulatory protein since its sequence is conserved among the mammalian hepadnaviridae members. A debate exists regarding the role of this protein in the HBV life-cycle, however, it is evident that at least, in woodchucks, pX plays an essential role in woodchuck HBV infection (2Chen H.S.

In addition, pX activates transcription through NF-κB (5Faktor O. Shaul Y. Oncogene. 1990; 5: 867-872PubMed Google Scholar, 9Twu J.S. Chu K. Robinson W.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Virol. 1992; 66: 983-991Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). pX also interacts with the general transcription factors (12Haviv I. Vaizel D. Shaul Y. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3413-3420Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), consistent with its transcription coactivation function (13Haviv I. Vaizel D. Shaul Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1079-1085Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Interaction of pX with TFIIH was reported by a number of groups (12Haviv I. Vaizel D. Shaul Y. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3413-3420Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 14Wang X.W. Forrester K. Yeh H. Feitelson M.A. Gu J.R. Harris C.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

A. 1996; 93: 10578-10583Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). This interaction may be relevant not only to the role of pX in transcription but also in DNA repair. Significantly, pX interacts simultaneously with TFIIB and RNA-polymerase II possibly to facilitate polymerase recruitment to promoters (16Lin Y. Nomura T. Cheong J. Dorjsuren D. Iida K. Murakami S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7132-7139Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 17Haviv I. Shamay M. Doitsh G. Shaul Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1562-1569Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar).In addition to the transcription activators and general transcription factors a third group of proteins is needed to support transcription, collectively called coactivators or mediators. TBP-associated factors (TAFs) belong to this group of proteins. Interestingly, pX supports transcription in the absence of TAFs (12Haviv I. Vaizel D. Shaul Y. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3413-3420Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). In vitro studies on naked DNA templates revealed that pX functions in a TAF independent manner. In vivo, pX rescues the temperature-sensitive phenotype of the ts13 cell line which exhibits growth arrest at restrictive temperature due to a mutation in TAFII250. In addition, TBP mutants lacking TAF binding that poorly respond to activators exhibit wild type activity in the presence of pX, in vivo (18Haviv I. Matza Y. Shaul Y. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1217-1226Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Thus, pX can support transcription on chromatinized template in the absence of some of the transcription coactivators/mediators. While pX may be capable of alone coactivating transcription, it also may act by recruiting specific cellular coactivators. The latter possibility was addressed in this study by identifying pX-associated cellular proteins.The two-hybrid screen is a promising experimental approach to identifying additional pX interacting proteins. The conventional screen, although very powerful, is based on a transcriptional readout, and may provide spurious data when attempting to identify proteins that interact with general transcription factors, as pX does. Recently, a two-hybrid screen which relies on a cytoplasmic signaling event was described called the Sos Recruitment System (SRS). We utilized this system and isolated two clones that specifically and repeatedly interacted with pX in our screen. One of the isolated clones is the Tat-binding protein 1 that is described elsewhere (19Barak O. Aronheim A. Shaul Y. Virology. 2001; 283: 110-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Tat-binding protein-1 and its homologues, such as Sug1, are components of the proteasome 19S regulatory cap particle. These proteins have also been identified as transcription mediators. The second clone is a novel gene which we designated HBXAP (hepatitis B virus X-associated protein). HBXAP is a nucleoprotein of 240 kDa in size that contains a PHD/leukemia-associated protein finger, a motif shared by a variety of chromatin-associated proteins (20Aasland R. Gibson T.J. Stewart A.F. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 56-59Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (747) Google Scholar). We show that pX interacts with HBXAP both in vitro and in vivo and that this interaction potentiates the ability of HBXAP to coactivate NF-κB.DISCUSSIONBoth viral and cellular regulatory proteins participate in multiple protein-protein interactions. In contrast to other viruses, such as HIV, which encode many regulatory proteins, only a few proteins control the HBV life cycle. Yet, it has an outstanding capacity to infect and propagate with an efficiency that by far exceeds that of HIV as calculated by particle number per ml of serum. Although many factors might be responsible for this efficacy, we may assume that it is in part due to pX, the HBV regulatory protein, which has an extraordinary capacity to perform multiple functions. In this report we provide evidence for a physical and functional interaction between pX and HBXAP, a novel cellular nuclear protein with the attributes of a transcription coactivator. pX, like many other viral regulators, interacts with cellular proteins to recruit the machinery needed to support viral propagation and to counteract the cellular defense systems. A favorable approach to investigate the molecular mechanisms of HBV-host cell interaction is the characterization of pX target cellular proteins. Previous biochemical experiments have revealed a number of pX-interacting cellular proteins that are components of the transcription machinery. However, none of the pX-interacting proteins isolated by the two-hybrid screen (26Cong Y.S. Yao Y.L. Yang W.M. Kuzhandaivelu N. Seto E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16482-16489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 27Huang J. Kwong J. Sun E.C. Liang T.J. J.

Virol. 1998; 72: 1737-1743Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), are known components of this machinery. We hypothesized that the conventional two-hybrid screen that is based on a transcriptional readout may not be suitable for identifying transcriptional activators and effectors because the system may be compromised by pX activity. Given this rationale we utilized the SRS two-hybrid screen (31Aronheim A. Zandi E. Hennemann H. Elledge S.J. Karin M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3094-3102Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar) that acts outside the nucleus at the plasma membrane. Two proteins were isolated, both are nuclear and have the characteristics of transcription coactivators, one is the Tat-binding protein 1 (TBP-1) that is described elsewhere (19Barak O. Aronheim A. Shaul Y. Virology. 2001; 283: 110-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) and the other HBXAP. Notably, recently we have identified three HBXAP isoforms designated α, β, and γ. In this study we used the HBXAPγ isoform that in comparison to α is N-terminal truncated (32Shamay M. Barak O. Shaul Y. GENOMICS. 2001; (in press)Google Scholar). Although the number of interactions in which pX is engaged is unexpectedly large, these multiple interactions appear to be a hallmark of viral regulatory proteins.Experiments were conducted to show that HBXAP is a genuine pX target. HBXAP physical interaction with pX was demonstrated in vitroand in vivo. We found that recombinant HBXAP is preferentially retained on the GST-pX column in a series of pull down experiments, suggesting that these proteins directly interact. The observed interaction must be specific and with relatively high affinity as HBXAP that is expressed in transfected cells is selectively retained by a GST-pX column. Furthermore, these proteins, when expressed in cells by co-transfection experiments are coimmunoprecipitated. HA-tagged HBXAP that is immunoprecipitated by anti-HA is associated with GFP-pX. Collectively, these data suggest that pX and HBXAP are in physical and direct contact.We provide evidence in support of the possibility that HBXAP and pX physical interaction has a functional significance. We show that HBXAP collaborates with HBV genome-encoded pX, to support HBV transcription. Co-transfection of HBV DNA with HBXAP expression vector resulted in an elevation in the level of the HBV transcripts. As this effect was not observed in the context of an HBV mutant that does not express pX, we assumed that pX is required for this process. This possibility was further supported by the fact that HBXAP activity was recapitulated by a co-transfected pX expressor plasmid. To gain mechanistic insight on the functional interaction between these proteins we employed reporter assays. Interestingly, functional collaboration between HBXAP and pX was observed in the context of HBV and NFκB-derived enhancers.To date several mechanisms were reported to explain the pX role in activating NF-κB (33Weil R. Sirma H. Giannini C. Kremsdorf D. Bessia C. Dargemont C. Brechot C. Israel A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 6345-6354Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 34Purcell N.H. Yu C. He D. Xiang J. Paran N. DiDonato J.A. Yamaoka S. Shaul Y. Lin A. Am. J. Physiol. Gastrointest. Liver Physiol. 2001; 280: G669-G677Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 35Waris G. Huh K.W. Siddiqui A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 7721-7730Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). Here we provide evidence for the nuclear pX role in NF-κB coactivation. Previously it has been reported that at least a fraction of pX is localized in the nucleus (17Haviv I. Shamay M. Doitsh G. Shaul Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1562-1569Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar) and that pX directly interacts with IκBα, which is able to transport it to the nucleus by a piggyback mechanism (33Weil R. Sirma H. Giannini C. Kremsdorf D. Bessia C. Dargemont C. Brechot C. Israel A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 6345-6354Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We took this event a step further to show that in the nucleus coactivation of NF-κB by pX is modulated by a novel transcription coactivator, HBXAP. We have performed a set of experiments to localize pX function along the NF-κB activation pathway. Given the fact that pX-HBXAP stimulate NF-κB activity in the presence of TNF-α, where the majority of NF-κB is nuclear, it is reasonable to localize the effect of this complex downstream to nuclear translocation of NF-κB. Thus, pX-HBXAP effect is restricted to the DNA-bound NF-κB, and therefore displays the attributes of transcription coactivators.The finding that HBXAP blocks TNF-α-induced NF-κB activation is rather interesting given the fact that some of the well described members of the PHD family, including Trithorax, ALL-1, TIF1, CBP, and p300, are transcription coactivators. However, a number of studies indicate that the PHD finger might be involved in transcription repression. The PHD and bromo-domain of KAP-1 form a cooperative unit with silencing activity. In that case KAP-1, mediated silencing requires association with NuRD and HDAC activity (36Schultz D.C. Friedman J.R. Rauscher F.J. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 428-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the PHD finger in context with the bromo-domain of KAP-1 are sufficient to represses transcription when artificially recruited to DNA via GAL4-DBD (36Schultz D.C. Friedman J.R. Rauscher F.J. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 428-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar). Mi-2β, a PHD finger protein was also reported to interact with HDAC1, and its two PHD fingers are essential but not sufficient for the interaction (23Zhang Y. LeRoy G. Seelig H.P. Lane W.S. Reinberg D. Cell. 1998; 95: 279-289Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (680) Google Scholar). In addition, it was reported that the PHD-like motif in the DNA methyltransferase Dnmt3a, represses transcription via the recruitment of HDAC-1 (37Fuks F. Burgers W.A. Godin N. Kasai M. Kouzarides T. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2536-2544Crossref PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar). Collectively, it appears that a number of PHD proteins are active in transcription silencing and that the PHD finger via interaction with HDAC is at least partially responsible for this function. Likewise, when we recruited HBXAP to DNA via GAL4-DBD it represses transcription. Furthermore, the PHD finger of HBXAP as an independent structural unit has very strong repression activity (32Shamay M. Barak O. Shaul Y. GENOMICS. 2001; (in press)Google Scholar). The fact that pX interacts with HBXAP in a region containing this domain might be significant. pX by binding the PHD finger may displace the associated HDAC corepressor to permit transcription activation, a switching that we have observed in the context of TNF-α-induced NF-κB activation.PHD containing proteins are often associated with cancer. Their chromosomal locations are amplified and rearranged in many tumors, including MOZ in leukemia (38Aguiar R.C. Chase A. Coulthard S. Macdonald D.H. Carapeti M. Reiter A. Sohal J. Lennard A. Goldman J.M. Cross N.C. Blood. 1997; 90: 3130-3135Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 39Carapeti M. Aguiar R.C. Goldman J.M. Cross N.C. Blood. 1998; 91: 3127-3133Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), CBP in acute myologenous leukemia (40Giles R.H. Dauwerse J.G. Higgins C. Petrij F. Wessels J.W. Beverstock G.C. Dohner H. Jotterand-Bellomo M. Falkenburg J.H. Slater R.M. van Ommen G.J. Hagemeijer A. van der Reijden B.A. Breuning M.H. Leukemia. 1997; 11: 2087-2096Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), and ALL-1 in acute lymphocytic leukemia (41Gu Y. Nakamura T. Alder H. Prasad R. Canaani O. Cimino G. Croce C.M. Canaani E. Cell. 1992; 71: 701-708Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (789) Google Scholar). At the moment it is too early to conclude whether HBXAP is associated with cancer, but there is evidence in support of this possibility. The region 11q13.4–14.1, where the hbxap gene is located was reported to be amplified in 7–10% of breast cancer (42Szepetowski P. Ollendorff V. Grosgeorge J. Courseaux A. Birnbaum D. Theillet C. Gaudray P. Oncogene. 1992; 7: 2513-2517PubMed Google Scholar), amplified, and rearranged in multiple endocrine neoplasia type I syndrome (MEN1) (43Larsson C. Skogseid B. Oberg K. Nakamura Y. Nordenskjold M. Nature. 1988; 332: 85-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (896) Google Scholar), and B-cells malignancies. We have found the amplification of thehbxap gene in a few cases of breast cancers that we have analyzed (data not shown). However, since pX is the putative HBV oncogene, the behavior of this genomic locus in hepatocellular carcinomas is of particular interest. Therefore, we found it rather remarkable that 11q13 is amplified in 15% of HBV-positive tumors, but only a rare event in HCV-positive cases (44Kusano N. Shiraishi K. Kubo K. Oga A. Okita K. Sasaki K. Hepatology. 1999; 29: 1858-1862Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that this amplification is related to the progression of HBV-infected HCCs. Interestingly, we have identified in one of the HCC cell lines an HBV integrant containing a functional enhancer at this chromosomal locus (45Shamay M. Agami R. Shaul Y. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 6811-6819Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The possibility that the hbxap gene is indeed amplified in these HCCs or activated by the integrated HBV sequences is of highest interest and may shed new light on the mechanism of oncogenic function of HBV. Study of the interactions of the virus with the host cell is a promising approach to understand, at the molecular level, how the virus evades the defense strategies of the cells they infect. Hepatitis B virus (HBV)1 is a hepatotropic virus containing a partially double-stranded circular DNA genome that causes both acute and chronic hepatic injuries. Persistent HBV infection is strongly associated with the development of hepatocellular carcinoma (1Ganem D. Varmus H.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1987; 56: 651-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (813) Google Scholar). The compact 3.2-kbp genome contains enhancers and multiple promoters that are regulated by the cellular transcription machinery. HBV encodes a single known regulatory polypeptide, called pX (or HBx). pX is likely to be an important regulatory protein since its sequence is conserved among the mammalian hepadnaviridae members. A debate exists regarding the role of this protein in the HBV life-cycle, however, it is evident that at least, in woodchucks, pX plays an essential role in woodchuck HBV infection (2Chen H.S. Kaneko S. Girones R. Anderson R.W. Hornbuckle W.E. Tennant B.C. Cote P.J. Gerin J.L. Purcell R.H. Miller R.H. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 1218-1226Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,3Zoulim F. Saputelli J. Seeger C. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 2026-2030Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). At the cellular level pX supports transcription and signaling (for review, see Ref. 4Murakami S. J. Gastroenterol. 2001; 36: 651-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). pX increases HBV transcription by trans-activating the viral enhancer-I via the sequence named the E-element (5Faktor O. Shaul Y. Oncogene. 1990; 5: 867-872PubMed Google Scholar). This element binds a number of bZip cellular transcription activators including cAMP-response element-binding protein (CREB) and activating transcription factor (ATF) whose binding is potentiated by the presence of pX (6Faktor O.

The lung has the largest epithelial surface area of the body in order to facilitate air exchange. The structure of alveoli is protected by surfactant membrane. Pulmonary surfactant is a complex mixture of lipids and proteins that form an insoluble film to reduce surface tension at the air/liquid interface in the alveoli. The reduction of surface tension at the alveolar surface promotes lung expansion on inspiration and prevents lung collapse on expiration. Deficiency of pulmonary surfactant is responsible for increased surface tension along the alveolar epithelium and brings about alveolar collapse and epithelial cell lysis, resulting in respiratory distress syndrome, a major cause of morbidity and mortality in preterm infants. Pulmonary surfactant is composed of 90–95% lipids and 5–10% proteins. Among surfactant proteins, SP-B 1The abbreviations used are: SP-Bsurfactant protein BRAretinoic acidRAREretinoic acid responsive elementRARretinoid nuclear receptorACTRactivator of thyroid and retinoic acid receptorADactivation domainBDbinding domainCREBcAMP-response element-binding proteinCBPCREB-binding proteinILinterleukinJAKJanus family tyrosine kinaseSTATsignal transducers and activators of transcriptionTTF-1thyroid transcription factor 1hhuman 1The abbreviations used are: SP-Bsurfactant protein BRAretinoic acidRAREretinoic acid responsive elementRARretinoid nuclear receptorACTRactivator of thyroid and retinoic acid receptorADactivation domainBDbinding domainCREBcAMP-response element-binding proteinCBPCREB-binding proteinILinterleukinJAKJanus family tyrosine kinaseSTATsignal transducers and activators of transcriptionTTF-1thyroid transcription factor 1hhuman is a 79-amino acid amphipathic peptide produced by the proteolytic cleavage of proSP-B in alveolar type II and Clara epithelial cells. The SP-B peptide is stored in lamellar bodies and secreted with phospholipids into the airway lumen. It facilitates the stability and rapid spreading of surfactant phospholipids during respiratory cycles (1.Whitsett J.A. Nogee L.M. Weaver T.E. Horowitz A.D. Physiol. Rev. 1995; 75: 749-757Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). SP-B plays a critical role in postnatal lung function. Null mutations in the SP-B gene cause lethal respiratory distress in newborn infants and in SP-B-deficient mice produced by gene targeting (2.Clark J.C. Wert S.E. Bachurski C.J. Stahlman M.T.

Innate defenses and the acquired immune system protect the lung from microorganisms in part mediated and regulated by the production of proinflammatory cytokines, chemokines, and growth factors (4.Zhang P. Summer W.R. Bagby G.J. Nelson S. Immunol. Rev. 2000; 173: 39-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). Airway macrophages and epithelial cells express numerous pleiotropic cytokines that play a pivotal role in inflammatory remodeling responses and the pathogenesis of airway disorders (5.Holgate S.T. Clin. Exp. Allergy. 2000; 30 Suppl. 1: 37-41Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6.Takizawa H. Int. J. Mol. Med. 1998; 1: 367-378PubMed Google Scholar). It is poorly understood how homeostasis of surfactant proteins is affected by cytokines and their downstream signaling molecules during pulmonary inflammation.The JAKs/STATs pathway was originally discovered through the study of interferon-induced intracellular signal transduction (7.Yan C. Tamm I. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 20188-20194Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8.Darnell Jr., J.E. Kerr I.M. Stark G.R.

A. 1992; 89: 7840-7843Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar). Subsequent studies showed that they are activated in response to many different cytokines and growth factors (10.Leonard W.J. O'Shea J.J. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1998; 16: 293-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (1460) Google Scholar). Upon ligand binding, JAKs activate members of the STAT family through phosphorylation of a single tyrosine. Activated STATs form dimers, translocate to the nucleus, and bind to specific response elements in promoters of target genes. Four mammalian JAK members (JAK1, JAK2, JAK3, and TYK2) and seven STAT members (STAT1, STAT2, STAT3, STAT4, STAT5a, STAT5b, and STAT6) have been identified to date. A given JAK or STAT family member is only activated by specific cytokines (10.Leonard W.J. O'Shea J.J. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1998; 16: 293-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (1460) Google Scholar, 11.Ihle J.N. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 211-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (585) Google Scholar). In the lung, the functions of JAKs and STATs on lung development and surfactant protein gene expression remain unclear.Expression of the SP-B gene is highly tissue-specific, restricted to respiratory alveolar type II epithelial cells and non-ciliated bronchiolar epithelial cells (Clara cells). In vitro, expression of the SP-B gene is also highly cell line-specific. Many non-lung cell lines do not support SP-Bgene expression, including HeLa cells (12.Di Bohinski R.J. Lauro R. Whitsett J.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5671-5681Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar). Human pulmonary adenocarcinoma H441 cells have been used extensively in the characterization of SP-B gene regulation (12.Di Bohinski R.J. Lauro R. Whitsett J.A. Mol. Cell.

There are two regions (−33 to −150 and −331 to −500) highly conserved in the promoters of both human and mouse SP-B genes (18.Bruno M.A. Bohinski R.J. Carter J.E. Foss K.A. Whitsett J.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 268: L381-L390PubMed Google Scholar). The region located between −150 and −33 bp contains functional binding sites for thyroid transcription factor 1 (TTF-1) and hepatocyte nuclear factor 3 (HNF3) (12.Di Bohinski R.J. Lauro R. Whitsett J.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5671-5681Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar). The region located between −500 and −331 bp contains TTF-1 and retinoic acid response element (RARE) sites mediating retinoic acid (RA) action (15.Naltner A. Ghaffari M. Whitsett J.A. Yan C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 56-62Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 19.Naltner A. Wert S. Whitsett J.A. Yan C. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: L1066-L1074Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). RA receptors (RARs) and nuclear receptor co-activators (including p160 co-activators and CBP/p300) strongly stimulated expression of the hSP-B 500 luciferase reporter gene through RARE in the −500 to −331 bp region (15.Naltner A. Ghaffari M. Whitsett J.A. Yan C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 56-62Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 19.Naltner A. Wert S. Whitsett J.A. Yan C. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: L1066-L1074Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). More importantly, RARE sites are overlapping with clustered TTF-1 binding sites. Mutations at clustered TTF-1 DNA binding sites abolished the RAR/nuclear receptor co-activator-mediated RA action (15.Naltner A. Ghaffari M. Whitsett J.A. Yan C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 56-62Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). TTF-1 is a homeodomain containing a tissue-specific transcription factor of Nkx2 family members that strongly stimulated hSP-B transcription (12.Di Bohinski R.J. Lauro R. Whitsett J.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5671-5681Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar, 13.Yan C. Sever Z. Whitsett J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24852-24857Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). TTF-1 was only expressed in the lung, thyroid, and part of forebrain (20.Lazzaro D. Price M. de Felice M. Di Lauro R. Development. 1991; 113: 1093-1104Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 21.Kimura S. Hara Y. Pineau T. Fernandez-Salguero P. Fox C.H. Ward J.M. Gonzalez F.J.. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 60-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (989) Google Scholar). In the lung, TTF-1 was present at the earliest stages of differentiation of epithelium and was later confined to conducting airway epithelial cells and type II epithelial cells in alveoli (19.Naltner A. Wert S. Whitsett J.A. Yan C. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: L1066-L1074Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,20.Lazzaro D. Price M. de Felice M. Di Lauro R.

Studies of the mammalian two-hybrid and glutathione S-transferase pull-down systems indicated a direct interaction between RAR and TTF-1 (17.Yan C. Naltner A. Conkright J. Ghaffari M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 21686-21691Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Together, RAR, TTF-1, and nuclear receptor co-activators (p160 co-activators and CBP/p300) formed an enhanceosome in the hSP-B −500 to −331 bp region (15.Naltner A. Ghaffari M. Whitsett J.A. Yan C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 56-62Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 17.Yan C. Naltner A. Conkright J. Ghaffari M. J. Biol.

Physiol. 2000; 279: L1066-L1074Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).In this report, stimulation of hSP-B 500 transcription by JAK1 and STAT3 and their upstream stimuli, interleukin 6 (IL-6) and interleukin 11 (IL-11), was observed. In addition, a synergistic stimulatory effect between RA and IL-6/IL-11 was observed in H441 cells. This was mediated at least by interaction between STAT3 and hSP-B enhanceosome proteins, including TTF-1, RARα, and ACTR (activator of thyroid and retinoic acid receptor).MATERIALS AND METHODSConstruction of PlasmidsThe plasmid constructs of hSP-B 500 bp, pG5LUC, pM RARα BD, and pVP16 TTF-1 AD were made previously (15.Naltner A. Ghaffari M. Whitsett J.A. Yan C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 56-62Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 17.Yan C. Naltner A. Conkright J. Ghaffari M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 21686-21691Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). pM STAT3 BD was made by subcloning the STAT3 cDNA into the pM BD vector (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA) at the EcoRI/XbaI sites following a procedure as described previously (15.Naltner A. Ghaffari M. Whitsett J.A. Yan C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 56-62Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). pVP16 STAT3 AD was made by subcloning STAT3 cDNA into the pVP-16 vector (CLONTECH) at the EcoRI/XbaI sites. Plasmid pM-53 BD and pVP16-CP AD were purchased from CLONTECH..Cell CultureHuman pulmonary adenocarcinoma cells (H441) were cultured in RPMI supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, glutamine, and penicillin/streptomycin. Cells were maintained and passaged weekly at 37 °C in 5% CO2/air.Transfection and Reporter Gene AssaysH441 cells were seeded at densities of 2 × 105 cells per well in 6-well plates. The hSP-B 500 luciferase reporter construct (0.25 μg) or the hSP-B (−500/−331)/SV40 promoter luciferase reporter construct (0.25 μg) and pCMV-βgal plasmid (0.5 μg) were transfected with various concentrations of JAKs, STATs, IL-6 receptor subunits, and IL-11 receptor subunits into H441 cells by FuGENE 6 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) as specified in the figure legends. Treatment of H441 cells with IL-6, IL-11 (Sigma), and/or all -trans RA (CalBiochem) was on the following day. After 2 days of incubation, cells were lysed, and luciferase activities were performed using the luciferase assay system (Promega). The light units were assayed by luminometry (Monolight 3010, Analytical Luminescence Laboratory, San Diego, CA). In each transfection, β-galactosidase activities were determined for normalization of transfection efficiency.Mammalian Two-hybrid System AssayTransient transfections of the mammalian two-hybrid constructs were performed as described previously (15.Naltner A. Ghaffari M. Whitsett J.A. Yan C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 56-62Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 17.Yan C. Naltner A. Conkright J. Ghaffari M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 21686-21691Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). H441 cells were seeded at a density of 3 × 105 cells per well in a 6-well plate. The paired AD/BD constructs were transfected along with the pCMV/β-gal vector (0.5 μg) and the pG5Luciferase reporter vector (0.5 μg) (15)using FuGENE 6 (Roche/Roche Molecular Biochemicals) as specified in the figure legends. The cells were harvested 48 h after transfection and assayed by luminometry. β-Galactosidase activities were determined for normalization.ImmunohistochemistryThe lung from a wild type FVB/N adult mouse was infused with a fixative solution (4% paraformaldehyde, 1 × phosphate-buffered saline) and was dissected out and stored in fixative at 4 °C for ∼24 h. After fixation and embedding in paraffin, lung tissue sections were cut to 5 μm thick. The adult lung slides were baked at 60 °C for 2 h and washed in a series of xylene and ethanol to remove paraffin from the tissues followed by antigen retrieval procedure. Endogenous peroxidase activity was removed from the adult mouse lung tissues by incubating the tissue slides in methanol and hydrogen peroxide for 15 min. Tissue slides were incubated overnight at 4 °C with primary JAK1 (1:500, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), STAT3 (1:1,000, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), or TTF-1 (1:10,000) antibodies. No primary antibody was added in the negative control. The tissues were washed and treated with secondary conjugated antibodies 24 h later. The interactions were amplified with Vectastain's Elite ABC kit to visualize the signals.Purification of mRNA and Reverse Transcription-PCRFor the in vivo assay, 8-week-old Swiss black mice received 600 units of IL-6 or 0.3 μg of IL-11. The control animals received phosphate-buffered saline. After 24 h, whole lungs were dissected out from animals and were placed on dry ice immediately. Total RNAs were purified, and RNA concentrations were determined. One μg of total RNA from each sample was subject to reverse transcription-PCR assay using a pair of primers corresponding to the SP-B coding regions described previously (16.Yan C. Ghaffari M. Whitsett J.A. Zeng X. Sever Z. Lin S. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: L239-L246Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). After gel electrophoresis, DNAs were transferred onto a nitrocellular membrane and were hybridized with the radiolabeled SP-B cDNA probe to confirm authentic PCR bands.RESULTSJAK and STAT Stimulation of hSP-B TranscriptionTo understand the mechanism whereby cytokines regulate SP-B gene expression in lung epithelial cells, the human SP-B 500 luciferase reporter gene vector was co-transfected with various JAK and STAT family members into H441 cells. In a dose-dependent study of JAK family members, only JAK1 modestly stimulated expression of the hSP-B 500 luciferase reporter gene (Fig. 1A). JAK2 and JAK3 showed a small inhibitory effect. The effect is statistically significant by an ANOVA (analysis of variance) analysis (p < 0.05). In another dose-dependent study of STAT family members, only STAT3 stimulated expression of the hSP-B 500 luciferase reporter gene (Fig. 1B). These studies demonstrated that the hSP-B 500 promoter was selectively activated by JAK1 and STAT3, implying that only a subset of cytokines may influence h SP-B gene expression through the hSP-B −500 to +41 bp region in respiratory epithelial cells.STAT3C Stimulation and STAT3β Suppression of hSP-B TranscriptionIt has been reported previously (24.Bromberg J.F. Wrzeszczynska M.H. Devgan G. Zhao Y. Pestell R.G. Albanese C. Darnell Jr., J.E. Cell. 1999; 98: 295-303Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2472) Google Scholar) that substitution of two cysteine residues within the C-terminal loop of the SH2 domain of STAT3 resulted in a constitutively active form, STAT3C. STAT3C dimerized spontaneously to bind to DNA and activated transcription (24.Bromberg J.F. Wrzeszczynska M.H. Devgan G. Zhao Y. Pestell R.G. Albanese C. Darnell Jr., J.E. Cell. 1999; 98: 295-303Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2472) Google Scholar). When STAT3C was co-transfected with the hSP-B 500 luciferase reporter gene into H441 cells, it was a much more potent stimulator to the hSP-B promoter than wild type STAT3 in a dose-dependent study (Fig. 2A). On the other hand, a dominant negative form, STAT3β, was also identified (31.Caldenhoven E. van Dijk T.B. Solari R. Armstrong J. Raaijmakers J.A. Lammers J.W. Koenderman L. de Groot R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13221-13227Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). Co-transfection of STAT3β significantly suppressed hSP-B500 luciferase reporter gene activity in a dose-dependent study (Fig. 2B). These results further support the functional role of STAT3 in hSP-B transcription.Figure 2Transcriptional regulation of hSP-B 500 by STAT3C and STAT3β in H441 cells. Various concentrations of STAT3C (A) and STAT3β (B) expression vectors were co-transfected with the hSP-B 500 bp luciferase reporter gene vector (0.25 μg) and with 0.5 μg of pCMV-βgal vector into H441 cells. After 2 days of incubation, cells were lysed, and luciferase activities were performed using the luciferase assay system (Promega). The light units were assayed by luminometry. In each transfection, β-galactosidase activities were determined for normalization of transfection efficiency.

TTF-1 was used as a positive control in this study, which was expressed restrictively in respiratory epithelial cells. Similar to TTF-1, immunohistochemical staining detected expression of STAT3 in alveolar type II epithelial cells where SP-B is synthesized and processed (Fig. 3A). On the other hand, JAK1 expression was detected in more cell types. In addition, both JAK1 and STAT3 were detected in epithelial cells of conducting airways (Fig. 3B). No staining was observed in a negative control. Expression of STAT3 in the lung was also observed by Northern blot analysis (25.Akira S. Nishio Y. Inoue M. Wang X.J. Wei S. Matsusaka T. Yoshida K. Sudo T. Naruto M. Kishimoto T. Cell. 1994; 77: 63-71Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (864) Google Scholar). Taken together, JAK1 and STAT3 were co-localized with SP-B, TTF-1, RAR, and nuclear receptor co-activators in the same respiratory epithelial cells of the lung (15.Naltner A. Ghaffari M. Whitsett J.A. Yan C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 56-62Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 19.Naltner A. Wert S. Whitsett J.A. Yan C. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: L1066-L1074Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Figure 3JAK1 and STAT3 expression in lung epithelial cells. The adult mouse lung was stained with TTF-1, JAK1, and STAT3 antibodies as described under “Materials and Methods.” Original magnification was at ×460.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)IL-6 and IL-11 Stimulation of hSP-B Transcription in H441 CellsSTAT3 is known to be activated by IL-6 family cytokines (26.Zhong Z. Wen Z. Darnell Jr., J.E. Science. 1994; 264: 95-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (1693) Google Scholar, 27.Taga T. Kishimoto T. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1997; 15: 797-819Crossref PubMed Scopus (1286) Google Scholar). Since STAT3 stimulated transcription of the hSP-Bpromoter, stimulation of the hSP-B 500 luciferase reporter gene by IL-6 and IL-11 was assessed. The hSP-B 500 luciferase reporter gene vector was co-transfected with IL-6 receptor (IL-6R/gp130) or IL-11 receptor (IL-11R/gp130) subunit expression vectors into H441 cells. Cells were then treated with 5 units/ml IL-6 or 5 ng/ml IL-11. Without receptor co-transfection, the hSP-B 500 luciferase reporter gene did not respond to the stimulation of IL-6 or IL-11 treatment, indicating that H441 cells did not have enough receptors to mediate IL-6 or IL-11 signaling. With cotransfection of IL-6R/gp130 subunits or IL-11R/gp130 subunits, significant stimulation (∼4-fold) of the hSP-B 500 luciferase reporter gene was observed (Fig. 4, A and B). This is probably due to the effect of pre-existing cytokines in tissue culture medium. Treatment of IL-6 or IL-11 in the presence of receptors further stimulated expression of the hSP-B 500 luciferase reporter gene to 8–10-fold (Fig. 4, A and B).Figure 4Transcriptional activation of hSP-B 500 by IL-6 and IL-11 in H441 cells and in the mouse lung. In one group, the hSP-B 500 bp luciferase reporter gene vector (0.25 μg) and 0.5 μg of the pCMV-βgal vector were transfected into cells (A). In a second group, IL-6R (1.0 μg) and hgp130 (1.0 μg) subunit expression vectors were co-transfected with the hSP-B 500 bp luciferase reporter gene vector (0.25 μg) and with the pCMV-βgal vector (0.5 μg) into H441 cells. On the next day, both groups of cells were treated with 5 units/ml of IL-6 (Sigma). In controls, no cytokine was added. After 2 days of incubation, cells were lysed, and luciferase activities were performed using the luciferase assay system (Promega). In each transfection, β-galactosidase activities were determined for normalization of transfection efficiency. Values are means +S.D., n = 3. In panel B, the experiment was performed essentially the same as outlined in panel A except that IL-11R (1.0 μg) and hgp130 (1.0 μg) subunit expression vectors were used for co-transfection and treated with 5 ng/ml of IL-11.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)SP-B mRNA Elevation by IL-6 and IL-11 in MiceThe in vivo effect of IL-6 and IL-11 on SP-B gene expression was also assessed in mice. Adult Swiss black mice were intratracheally administered IL-6 (600 units/mouse) or IL-11 (0.3 μg/mouse). After 24 h, lungs were dissected out, and total mRNAs were purified. Semiquantitative reverse transcription-PCR was used to study regulation of SP-B mRNA expression by IL-6 and IL-11. SP-B mRNAs in IL-6- and IL-11-treated adult animal lungs were significantly elevated in comparison with control (Fig. 5). This seems to indicate that Clara cells or alveolar type II epithelial cells express IL-6 or IL-11 receptors to mediate SP-B expression in vivo.Figure 5Increase of SP-B mRNA by IL-6 and IL-11 treatment in mice. Lungs from phosphate-buffered saline-, IL-6- (600 units/animal), or IL-11- (0.3 μg/animal) treated animals were dissected out, and total mRNAs were purified. SP-B mRNA was semiquantitatively determined by reverse transcription-PCR using a pair of primers corresponding to the SP-B coding regions. No significant change of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase mRNAs was observed in IL-6- or IL-11-treated animals (data not shown).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Synergistic Stimulation between IL-6/IL-11 and RA on the hSP-B (−500/−331)/SV40 Promoter Luciferase Reporter GeneSince both RA and IL-6 or IL-11 stimulated the hSP-B 500 luciferase reporter gene, interactions between the two signaling pathways were investigated. H441 cells were co-transfected with IL-6R/gp130 or IL-11R/gp130 subunits and the hSP-B (−500/−331)/SV40 promoter luciferase reporter gene that contains hSP-B −500 to −331 bp region and mediates RA/RAR and nuclear receptor co-activator stimulation. H441 cells were treated with all-trans RA, IL-6, or IL-11. RA, IL-6, and IL-11 stimulated expression of the chimeric reporter gene individually (Fig. 6). When H441 cells were co-treated with RA and IL-6 (or IL-11), a synergistic stimulation was observed (Fig. 6), suggesting that RA and IL-6 (or IL-11) signaling pathways can cross-talk in the hSP-B −500 to −331 bp region. No stimulation was observed when the SV40 promoter luciferase reporter gene vector was used in a similar study (data not shown). It is noticed that, unlike the hSP-B 500 luciferase reporter gene, the hSP-B(−500/−331)/SV40 promoter luciferase reporter gene was not stimulated by IL-6R/gp130 or IL-11R/gp130 subunit transfection in the absence of IL-6 or IL-11, implying that other cis-elements outside the hSP-B −500 to −331 bp region may also play a role in mediating the stimulatory effect of IL-6 family cytokines.Figure 6Interaction between RA and IL-6 family cytokines in H441 cells. IL-6R/gp130 subunit expression vectors or IL-11/gp130 subunit expression vectors were co-transfected with the hSP-B (−500/−331)/SV40 promoter luciferase reporter construct (0.25 μg) and with 0.5 μg of the pCMV-βgal vector into H441 cells. On the next day, H441 cells were treated with all-trans RA (10−5m), 5 units/ml of IL-6, 5 ng/ml of IL-11, a combination of RA/IL-6, or a combination of RA/IL-11. After 2 days of incubation, cells were lysed, and luciferase activities were performed using the luciferase assay system (Promega).

Purified N15 protelomerase TelN is the only protein required to convert circular DNA substrates to the linear form with hairpin termini. Within the center of the telomerase occupancy site tos, the target for TelN is the 56-bp telRL consisting of the central 22-bp palindrome telO and two 14-bp flanking inverted sequence repetitions. DNase I footprinting of TelN-telRL complexes shows a segment of ∼50 bp protected by TelN. Surface plasmon resonance studies demonstrate that this extended footprint is caused by two TelN molecules bound to telRL. Stable TelN-target DNA complexes are achieved with telRL; however, the additional sequences of tos stabilize the TelN-target complexes.TelO alone is not sufficient for specific stable complex formation. However, processing can occur, i.e. generation of the linear covalently closed DNA. Within the context oftelRL, sequences of telO are involved in specific TelN-telRL complex formation, in processing itself, and/or in recognition of the processing site. The sequence of the central (CG)3 within telO that is part of a 14-bp stretch proposed to have Z-DNA conformation is essential for processing but not for formation of specific TelN-telRLcomplexes. The concerted action of both TelN molecules at the target site is the basis for telomere resolution.

Capturing of reaction intermediates demonstrates that TelN binds covalently to the 3′-phosphoryl of the cleaved strands. resonance units N15 is a lambdoid, temperate Escherichia coli phage that has double-stranded DNA with cohesive ends packaged in the virion (1Rybchin V.N. Svarchevsky A.N. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 33: 895-903Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The complete nucleotide sequence of the 46-kb genome is known (2Ravin V. Ravin N. Casjens S. Ford M.E. Hatfull G.F. Hendrix R.W. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 299: 53-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Upon infection of E. coli, the DNA circularizes via thecos ends. In contrast to other temperate phages, N15 does not integrate into the host genome. Lysogeny is established by processing the telomere resolution site telRL to form a linear genome with covalently closed, hairpin-like ends telLand telR (see “Discussion”). The proposed telomerase occupancy site tos (1Rybchin V.N. Svarchevsky A.N. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 33: 895-903Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) contains a series of inverted repeats centered on the 56-bp palindromic telRL. This palindrome or part of it could form a potential cruciform structure that may function as the real substrate of the telomerase TelN. In vivoreplication of linear N15 plasmids requires three N15-derived components as follows: the origin of replication ori, the replication initiation protein RepA, and TelN protein for resolution of the replicated telomeres (3Ravin N. Strakhova T. Kuprianov V. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 312: 899-906Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Ori probably is located immediately upstream of repA. repA is essential in N15 lytic replication and for maintenance of the linear prophage. Both lytic and lysogenic replication is independent of at least dnaA,dnaJ, dnaK, grpE, and recA(1Rybchin V.N. Svarchevsky A.N. Mol.

For telomere resolution, in vitro purified TelN and a telRL substrate are sufficient (6Deneke J. Ziegelin G. Lurz R. Lanka E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 7721-7726Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). In contrast to eukaryotic telomerases, TelN seems to be purely proteinaceous, lacking DNA synthesizing activity. The cleaving-joining activity of TelN resembles a specialized type of integrase that uses the same DNA molecule as donor and as acceptor. Phage N15 belongs to the small group of systems known to replicate as linear DNA with hairpin ends. Such linear genomes are generally of eukaryotic origin, but a few from eubacteria are known:Yersinia bacteriophage PY54 1S. Hertwig, I. Klein, R. Lurz, E. Lanka, and B.

However, several models for replication of linear DNA with hairpin ends exist (18Casjens S. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 1999; 2: 529-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). In one group, initiation of replication occurs at the hairpin ends by site-specific cleavage of one strand within the hairpin ends. The 3′-hydroxyls are then used as primers for strand displacement DNA synthesis. The other group contains an internal ori where θ-type replication initiates bidirectionally resulting in circular head-to-head and tail-to-tail dimers. These intermediates would then be processed by a cleaving-joining reaction, the telomere resolution, to regenerate covalently closed hairpin ends in the progeny molecules. Recently, telomere resolution was demonstrated in vivo for the linear Borrelia burgdorferi plasmid lp17 using telomere substrates (19Chaconas G. Stewart P.E. Tilly K. Bono J.L. Rosa P. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 3229-3237Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). For phage N15, even in vivocircular dimeric replication intermediates, resolution of these molecules via TelN telomerase activity was described (3Ravin N. Strakhova T. Kuprianov V. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 312: 899-906Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). This demonstrates that one completed round of replication results in two progeny molecules as is the case for most replication mechanisms except the rolling circle type. N15 serves as a model system to study replication of linear DNA with hairpin ends that allows the use of E. coli extracts circumventing pathogenic organisms or cells that are difficult to grow. This is the first report describing the architecture of the complex of a telomere resolvase with the cognate telomere resolution site, the nucleotide sequence requirements for target recognition and processing, and the properties of a captured reaction intermediate. We unravel binding of the protelomerase TelN to the target using fragment retention on gels and DNase I footprinting combined with surface plasmon resonance and mutagenesis studies. E. coliSCS1 (recA1, endA1, gyrA96, thi-1, hsdR17(r K− m K+), supE44, relA1, Stratagene) was used as the host for the telN overexpression plasmids and thetelRL target structures (6Deneke J.

Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual.2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The nucleotide sequence of recombinant DNA was verified by the dideoxynucleotide chain termination method (22Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The oligonucleotides were annealed to form thetelRL region with the desired mutation or deletion andHindIII and BamHI restriction sites at the fragment ends. The resulting double-stranded fragment was inserted asHindIII-BamHI fragment into pBR329 that had been prepared accordingly (6Deneke J. Ziegelin G. Lurz R. Lanka E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Open table in a new tab For mapping the binding sites of TelN by electron microscopy, the plasmids containing various TelN targets, pJD104 (harboring tos), pJD105 (telRL), or pJD106 (telO) (6Deneke J. Ziegelin G. Lurz R. Lanka E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 7721-7726Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), were linearized with either AatII or AseI. In the case of pJD104SphI was used instead of AseI. The linearized DNA was purified by electrophoresis on 0.7% agarose gels and subsequent gel extraction. 0.1 pmol of the plasmid was then incubated with 1–3 pmol of TelN Y424F protein in 10 μl of buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 25 mm potassium glutamate, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol for 30 min at 30 °C. For direct adsorption to mica (24Spiess E. Lurz R. Methods Microbiol. 1988; 20: 293-323Crossref Scopus (64) Google Scholar), the complexes were cross-linked for 10 min with 0.2% glutaraldehyde. 1 μl was diluted 30-fold in 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 10 mm MgCl2. Micrographs were taken with a Philips EM400. DNA molecules with protein bound were traced on 16-fold enlarged negatives on a LM4 digitizer (Brühl, Nürnberg, Germany). The protein binding positions were determined as described (25Lurz R. Heisig A. Velleman M. Dobrinski B. Schuster H. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 16575-16579Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The sources for the TelN target fragments were plasmids pJD104, pJD105, pJD105 A20TT21A, pJD106, and pBR329Δ1. The latter served as a control. Plasmids except pJD104 were digested with the restriction endonucleasesDraI and AccI. pJD104 was digested byDraI, BamHI, and SphI. From each of the plasmids except pJD104 five fragments were obtained. The fragment labeled D in Fig. 3 A contained the TelN targettelRL. pJD104 yielded seven fragments, with fragment D (Fig.3 A) carrying tos. The fragments obtained were treated with shrimp alkaline phosphatase and 5′-labeled using T4 polynucleotide kinase and [γ-32P]ATP as described (21Sambrook J. Fritsch E.T. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual.2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Fragments for DNase I footprint analyses were prepared by PCR amplification of fragments containing telRL. To achieve selective labeling of only one strand, one of the two primers (TableII) was 32P-5′-labeled. Plasmids pJD105 or pJD105A20TT21A (Table I) served as templates for generating a 159-bp fragment (pJD105 base pairs 212–370) that carry the wild type telRL sequence or telRL A20TT21A, respectively. Reaction mixtures for PCR contained 50 pmol of each the labeled and the unlabeled primers (TableII), 0.05 pmol of template, and 2 units of Deep Vent polymerase. The PCR fragments were purified by phenol extraction and ethanol precipitation. In 20 μl of buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 0.05 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 5 mm MgCl2, 2–5 nm DNA fragments were incubated at 37 °C for 30 min with 0–5 μm TelN Y424F. The reaction products were analyzed by electrophoresis on a 3.5% non-denaturing polyacrylamide gel as described previously (26Ziegelin G. Scherzinger E. Lurz R. Lanka E. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3703-3708Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The gel was autoradiographed using the phosphor storage technology (27Johnston R.F. Pickett S.C. Barker D.L. Electrophoresis. 1990; 11: 355-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar). The resulting image was documented using an Amersham Biosciences Storm PhosphorImager 820 and quantified by the use of the ImageQuant software version 5.0 (Amersham Biosciences). In 10 μl of buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 0.05 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 80 μm spermine, 5 mm CaCl2, 25 mm potassium glutamate, 0.1 mm EDTA, and 1 mm dithiothreitol, 5 pmol of PCR fragment was incubated with 0–50 pmol of TelN protein for 30 min at 30 °C. DNase I cleavage reactions were performed essentially as described (28Galas D.J. Schmitz A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1978; 5: 3157-3170Crossref PubMed Scopus (1340) Google Scholar, 29Ziegelin G. Fürste J.P. Lanka E. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 11989-11994Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). 1.5 μl of DNase I (0.0015 units, RNase-free, Roche Molecular Biochemicals) was added to the TelN-DNA complexes. Following 10 min at 37 °C, the DNase I was inactivated by adding 50 μl of a mixture of 1% SDS, 200 mm NaCl, 20 mm EDTA (pH 8.0), 25 ng/μl salmon sperm DNA. The reaction products were phenol-extracted and precipitated with ethanol containing 100 μg/ml glycogen. The pellet was dissolved in 5 μl of buffer (40 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.8), 2 mm EDTA), mixed with 2 μl of formamide/dye solution, heated for 3 min at 95 °C, and loaded onto a 6% (w/v) polyacrylamide-urea sequencing gel (30Garoff H. Ansorge W. Anal. Biochem. 1981; 115: 450-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). The cleavage pattern was visualized by autoradiography as described for the fragment retention assay. To generate a fragment pattern for the nucleotide sequence, dideoxy cycle sequencing was performed using the same conditions, templates, and radiolabeled primers as for the generation of the PCR fragments, except that Vent (exo−) polymerase was applied as described (31Sears L.E. Moran L.S. Kissinger C. Creasey T. Perry-O'Keefe H. Roskey M. Sutherland E. Slatko B.E. BioTechniques. 1992; 13: 626-633PubMed Google Scholar). Surface plasmon resonance was determined using a Biacore 2000 instrument (Biacore AB). Two DNA fragments were formed using synthetic oligonucleotides (Table II). One fragment consists of telRL within the original N15 nucleotide context, whereas the sequence of the other one was random. To differentiate between target-specific and nonspecific binding of TelN, 173 RU2 of each fragment biotinylated at one end was immobilized at the streptavidin matrix in separate chambers of an SA sensor chip according to the manufacturer's recommendations. 250 μl of TelN Y424F in various concentrations in buffer consisting of 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 5 mm MgCl2, 50 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 0.005% P20 surfactant (Biacore) with or without calf thymus DNA were injected for 375 s over the immobilized DNA. Then the complexes formed were washed with 120 μl of the same buffer for 180 s to allow for dissociation. The flow rate always was 40 μl/min. All runs were performed at 25 °C. Changes in plasmon resonance correspond to a change in mass bound to the chip and are measured in resonance units (1 RU corresponds to 1 ng/mm2for proteins). Resonance response for protein is higher than that observed for DNA (32Fischer P. Leu S.J.C. Yang Y.Y. Chen P.P. BioTechniques. 1994; 16: 828PubMed Google Scholar). For double-stranded DNA it was reported that RUprotein = 0.73 RUdsDNA (33Speck C. Weigel C. Messer W. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6169-6176Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Therefore, the values measured were corrected using this factor. Data were evaluated according to Ref. 33Speck C. Weigel C. Messer W. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6169-6176Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar using the BIAevaluate software version 3.0 (Biacore AB). Telomere resolution requires recognition and binding to the target DNA by TelN before processing via transesterification could take place. To study the recognition and binding step separated from telomere resolution, it was necessary to uncouple binding and transesterification. Hence, if not otherwise stated, for all protein-DNA binding studies a mutant TelN protein was used, in which the proposed active site Tyr-424 was replaced by a phenylalanine (6Deneke J. Ziegelin G. Lurz R. Lanka E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 7721-7726Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). TelNY424F has lost its transesterification activity but retained its specific DNA binding ability. To locate the binding site of TelN on the DNA, complex formation with three substrates, tos, telRL, andtelO, was followed by electron microscopy. Tos(telomerase occupancy site) has a size of 310 bp and is defined by the inverted sequence repetitions R1/L1 and R2/L2 flanking telRL (1Rybchin V.N. Svarchevsky A.N. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 33: 895-903Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The repeats R3/L3 enclose the palindromic telomere resolution sitetelO forming telRL (56 bp). The tossubstrate used here consists of 563 bp including neighboring N15-derived base pairs (6Deneke J. Ziegelin G. Lurz R. Lanka E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 7721-7726Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) (Table I). Knobs on the DNA indicate likely representative examples of complexes of TelN with tos (Fig. 1). Plotting the positions of the knobs versus the contour length of the DNA yielded histograms demonstrating the specificity of binding. As indicated by the peak positions in the histograms, site-specific complex formation was detected with tos andtelRL only (Fig. 2,A and B). The positions of the dots in TelN-telO complexes were scattered randomly along the DNA and did not map preferentially to a unique region showing that these complexes arose from non-sequence specific binding (Fig.2 C). From these data we conclude that tos has a unique binding site for TelN. Because telRL (56 bp) alone is sufficient for binding and the positions of the peaks on tosand telRL match perfectly, this binding site is telRL. TelRL consists of two inverted sequence repetitions, R3 and L3 (14 bp each), and the central palindrome telO (22 bp). The data on TelN-telRL (Fig. 2 B) and TelN-telO(Fig. 2 C) complexes show in addition that the sequences R3 and L3 are essential for specific complex formation, becausetelO alone failed to yield specific complexes. To learn more on the specificity of binding, the complex formation was studied by fragment retention in gel electrophoresis.Figure 2The binding site of TelN withintos is telRL. Each of th"

The cyclooxygenase inhibitor indomethacin (indo) eliminates UTP-promoted cAMP formation (i.e. via P2Y2 receptors) but only partially blocks ATP-promoted cAMP formation. The latter response is completely blocked by the nonselective P2Y receptor antagonist suramin. We have sought to identify the mechanism for this P2Y receptor-mediated, indo-resistant cAMP formation. The agonist rank order potencies for cAMP formation were: ADPβS ≥ MT-ADP > 2-MT-ATP > ADP, ATP, ATPγS > UTP, AMP, adenosine. We found a similar rank order in MDCK-D1 cells overexpressing cloned green fluorescent protein-tagged P2Y11 receptors, but the potency of the agonists was enhanced, consistent with a P2Y11 receptor-mediated effect. cAMP generation by the P2Y1 and P2Y11 receptor agonist ADPβS was not inhibited by several P2Y1-selective antagonists (PPADS, A2P5P, and MRS 2179). Forskolin synergistically enhanced cAMP generation in response to ADPβS or PGE2, implying that, like PGE2, ADPβS activates adenylyl cyclase via Gs, a conclusion supported by results showing ADPβS and MT-ADP promoted activation of adenylyl cyclase activity in MDCK-D1 membranes. We conclude that nucleotide-promoted, indo-resistant cAMP formation in MDCK-D1 cells occurs via Gs-linked P2Y11 receptors.

This can be a particularly vexing problem if subtype-selective agonists and antagonists are not available. One such example is P2Y receptors, which respond to ATP and other nucleotides, are expressed in a variety of tissues and cell types, and for which few subtype-selective antagonists exist (2Ralevic V.

Cyclooxygenase (COX) inhibitors, such as indomethacin (indo), have proven useful for studying P2Y receptors in MDCK-D1 cells (1Post S.R. Rump L.C. Zambon A. Hughes R.J. Buda M.D. Jacobson J.P.

Agonist-stimulated cAMP accumulation in MDCK-D1cells occurs via both indo-sensitive and -insensitive pathways. Response to the P2Y2 agonist UTP is entirely indo-sensitive, whereas response to ATP is partially sensitive and to 2-methylthio-ATP (MT-ATP) is insensitive (1Post S.R. Rump L.C. Zambon A. Hughes R.J.

These findings suggest that UTP, and ATP in part, stimulate P2Y2 receptors to cause COX-mediated (perhaps by both COX1 and COX2, see Ref. 15Ostrom R.S. Gregorian C. Drenan R.M. Gabot K. Rana B.K.

The present studies were designed to characterize more fully the nature of the latter pathway. Our working hypothesis, based in part on initial results obtained with MDCK-D1 cells (12Post S.R. Jacobson J.P. Insel P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2029-2032Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), was that the indo-resistant response might represent a P2Y1 receptor effect. The current data show results not consistent with this hypothesis but instead suggest a key role for another receptor, the P2Y11 receptor, in indo-resistant cAMP formation. The findings directly document a role for P2Y11 receptors in stimulation of adenylyl cyclase activity and in potentially contributing to autocrine-paracrine regulation by nucleotides. MDCK-D1 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% mixed serum (85% horse serum, 15% fetal bovine serum). Cells were used in assays at 60–80% confluency. GFP-tagged cP2Y11 receptor-overexpressing MDCK-D1 cells were cultured from the stable cell line prepared by Zambon et al. (14Zambon A.C. Brunton L.L. Barrett K.E. Hughes R.J. Torres B. Insel P.A. Mol. Pharmacol. 2001; 60: 26-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Prior to the treatment of the cells, the growth medium was removed, and cells were equilibrated for 30 min at 37 °C in serum-free 20 mm HEPES-buffered Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEH, pH 7.4). Subsequently, cells were incubated in fresh DMEH and various agents as shown in the figures. Incubations with the agonists ADPβS, MT-ADP, ATPγS, ATP, MT-ATP, ADP, AMP, adenosine, UTP, PGE2, and forskolin and the antagonists PPADS, A2P5P, and MRS 2179 were conducted for 7 min at 37 °C in the presence of 200 μm IBMX, a phosphodiesterase inhibitor, and terminated by placing on ice and replacing the medium with 7.5% trichloroacetic acid. Trichloroacetic acid extracts were frozen (−20 °C) until assay. Intracellular cAMP levels were determined by radioimmunoassay (Calbiochem) of trichloroacetic acid extracts following acetylation according to the manufacturer's protocol. Production of cAMP was normalized to the amount of acid-insoluble protein (Lowry and Bradford methods). Membranes were prepared from MDCK-D1 cells as follows: cells were grown to confluency on 15-cm plates and washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, the second wash containing 0 .01% EDTA. Cells were then incubated for 15 min at 37 °C in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.01% EDTA. Detached cells were centrifuged at 1,000 rpm, and the resulting pellet was suspended in 10 ml of 4 °C lysis buffer (20 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.4, 10 mm MgCl2, 2 mmEDTA, 2 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol) containing protease inhibitors (10 μm leupeptin, 500 nm pepstatin, 200 μm benzamidine, 200 μm 4-(2-aminoethyl) benzenesulfonylfluoride-HCl (AEBSF). Suspended cells were then placed under 450 p.s.i for 10 min to lyse the cells. The resulting lysed cell mixture was centrifuged at 2,000 rpm for 15 min at 4 °C to remove cell nuclei. The supernatant was separated from the nuclear pellet and centrifuged for 90 min at 15,000 rpm at 4 °C. The resulting pellet was suspended in buffer A (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 5 mmMgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mmdithiothreitol), which included protease inhibitors as indicated previously. A protein assay (Bio-Rad) was run to determine membrane protein concentration. Membranes were stored at −80 °C. 75 μg of membrane were placed in 1.5-ml Eppendorf tubes on ice. The volume was brought up to 250 μl using substrate (30 μm AMP-PNP), agonist, and buffer B (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm IBMX, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10 μm GTP, and protease inhibitors). Reaction tubes were then incubated in a 37 °C water bath for 30 min. The reaction was stopped by boiling for 1 min, and samples were then centrifuged for 10 min at 4 °C at 13,000 rpm. Supernatant cAMP levels were then determined using the radioimmunoassay protocol described above. Forskolin, PGE2, AMP-PNP, PPADS, and anti-cAMP antibody were purchased from Calbiochem.125I-cAMP was purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. ADPβS, ATPγS, MT-ADP, MT-ATP, ATP, ADP, AMP, adenosine, UTP, PGE2, A2P5P, IBMX, and indomethacin were purchased from Sigma. MRS 2179 was generously provided by Dr. Kenneth Jacobson, National Institutes of Health. Data shown generally represent mean ± S.E. of multiple determinations. Curves shown in Figs. 1 and 3 were obtained using the sigmoidal dose response function of Graph Pad Prizm (Graphpad Software Inc., San Diego, CA); analysis using this program yielded EC50 values shown in text and tables.Figure 3Overexpression of the P2Y11receptor in native MDCK cells enhances indo-resistant cAMP accumulation. Native MDCK cells (top panel) or MDCK cells overexpressing P2Y11-GFP receptors (bottom panel) were treated as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Cells were incubated for 30 min with indo (1 μm) and then for 7 min with IBMX (200 μm) and the indicated agonist.

Stimulation of cells with UTP was maximally able to increase cAMP levels ∼3-fold over basal levels, but consistent with previous results (1Post S.R. Rump L.C. Zambon A. Hughes R.J.

Treatment of cells with indo also partially decreased ATP-stimulated cAMP accumulation but was less effective than the inhibition of the response to UTP, particularly at higher concentrations of ATP (Fig. 1 B). The methylthio- derivative of ATP, MT-ATP, produced a largely indo-resistant increase in cAMP levels (Fig. 1 C). ATP can be sequentially dephosphorylated to ADP, AMP, and adenosine by ecto-ATPases and nucleotidases (16Chen B.C. Lin W.W. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 233: 442-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 17Zimmermann H. Naunyn-Schmiedeberg's Arch. Pharmacol. 2000; 362: 299-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (806) Google Scholar). To assess whether ATP was responsible for the observed increase in cAMP levels or whether an ATP metabolite might be responsible, we treated cells with an ATPase-resistant form of ATP, ATPγS (16Chen B.C. Lin W.W. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 233: 442-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), and obtained results comparable with those observed with ATP (Fig. 1 D), suggesting that ATP need not be metabolized to raise cAMP levels. Like ATP, ADP elevated indo-resistant cAMP levels in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 1 E). ADPβS, a nonhydrolyzable analog of ADP, and MT-ADP both increased indo-resistant cAMP levels as much or more than did ADP, ATP, or ATPγS (Fig. 1, F and G). The ADPβS-stimulated cAMP increase was entirely indo-resistant. Stimulation of MDCK-D1 cells with AMP and adenosine, both metabolic breakdown products of ADP, did not elevate cAMP (Ref. 12Post S.R. Jacobson J.P. Insel P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2029-2032Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar and data not shown). The observed pattern of response for the different agonists, in particular with reference to ATP, ADP, ADPβS, and MT-ATP, suggested that indo-resistant cAMP accumulation might be the result of an action at the P2Y1 receptor (2Ralevic V. Burnstock G. Pharmacol. Rev. 1998; 50: 413-492PubMed Google Scholar, 3Nicholas R.A. Mol. Pharmacol. 2001; 60: 416-420PubMed Google Scholar, 4von Kugelgen I. Wetter A. Naunyn-Schmiedeberg's Arch.

The P2Y-nonselective antagonist suramin blocked this response to 10 μm ADPβS in MDCK-D1 cells (Fig. 2), but several other putative P2Y1-selective antagonists proved ineffective, including PPADS and A2P5P (2Ralevic V.

Additionally, the highly selective P2Y1 antagonist MRS 2179 failed to inhibit indo-resistant cAMP accumulation in MDCK-D1 cells even though in parallel control studies MRS 2179 inhibited canine P2Y1-mediated inositol trisphosphate formation in P2Y1-transfected 1231N1 cells (Ref. 20Nandanan E.

These findings suggested that the receptor responsible for the indo-insensitive effect is not the P2Y1 receptor but instead is another receptor, perhaps the P2Y11receptor, which in MDCK-D1 cells also responds to adenine bisphosphates (14Zambon A.C.

Investigation into whether the P2Y11 receptor can cause indo-resistant cAMP elevation in MDCK-D1 cells is hampered by the lack of antagonists to this receptor. Therefore, as an alternative strategy, we used P2Y11 receptors that we had cloned from MDCK-D1 cells expressed as P2Y11-GFP receptors in MDCK-D1 cells (14Zambon A.C. Brunton L.L. Barrett K.E. Hughes R.J. Torres B. Insel P.A. Mol. Pharmacol. 2001; 60: 26-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) and assessed cAMP accumulation. In the cells overexpressing P2Y11-GFP receptors, we found a 5- to 10-fold increase in sensitivity of indo-resistant cAMP formation in response to several nucleotides, compared with responses observed with native MDCK-D1 cells (Table I and Fig. 3). The relative potency of the different nucleotides in P2Y11-GFP-overexpressing MDCK-D1 cells was similar to that for native MDCK-D1 cells, although compared with other agonists, ADP had a somewhat greater enhancement in apparent potency in the P2Y11-overexpressing cells (Table I). UTP treatment gave no response; thus overexpression of P2Y11 receptors did not alter P2Y2 response (data not shown). Taken together with data in the native cells (Figs. 1 and 2), this enhancement of the indo-resistant cAMP formation in P2Y11-overexpressing MDCK-D1 cells is consistent with the notion that P2Y11, and not P2Y1, receptors mediate this response.Table IRank order potency of various adenine nucleotides as agonists of cAMP production in native and P2Y11 receptor-transfected MDCK-D1 cellsEC50 (MDCK)EC50 (P2Y11-GFP MDCK)ADPβS1.430.15MT-ATP7.761.30ADP9.190.73MT-ADP10.91.90ATP66.47.94Data are expressed as EC50 values in μm, are mean of triplicate determinations, and are representative of results from at least two experiments. Open table in a new tab Data are expressed as EC50 values in μm, are mean of triplicate determinations, and are representative of results from at least two experiments. To define the molecular mechanism underlying the indo-resistant cAMP elevation in MDCK-D1 cells, we assessed whether this response results from the coupling of a P2Y receptor, presumably the P2Y11 receptor, to an increase in adenylyl cyclase activity. In previous studies it has been difficult to ascertain whether P2Y11 receptors increase cAMP via a receptor/Gs-mediated activation of adenylyl cyclase activity or indirectly via alterations in calcium or other regulators of cAMP formation (14Zambon A.C.

Pharmacol. 2001; 132: 318-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). We used two approaches to assess this possibility. The diterpene forskolin enhances coupling of Gs-linked receptors to adenylyl cyclase, thereby enhancing the ability of Gs receptors to raise cellular cAMP levels (12Post S.R. Jacobson J.P. Insel P.A.

Co-incubation of indo-pretreated MDCK-D1cells with 10 μm ADPβS and 0.1 μmforskolin led to a cAMP elevation that was greater than the sum of the individual responses for forskolin and ADPβS. Co-incubation of forskolin and PGE2, a known Gs activator in MDCK-D1 cells (12Post S.R. Jacobson J.P. Insel P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2029-2032Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), showed an even greater enhancement of cAMP levels than was caused by co-incubation with ADPβS and forskolin (Fig. 4). Nevertheless, the synergistic effect obtained with forskolin and agonists, when expressed as -fold increase over the sum of separate forskolin- and agonist-stimulated cAMP accumulations, was similar or even greater for ADPβS-stimulated cAMP generation than for PGE2 response (Fig. 4,inset). These results suggest that ADPβS, like PGE2, activates Gs to promote cAMP formation in MDCK-D1 cells. As a more direct test for the ability of a P2Y receptor to couple to an increase in adenylyl cyclase activity, we sought to assay enzyme activity, but we reasoned that such an assay would require use of a nucleotide as a substrate, which unlike ATP was not active at the P2Y receptors that increase cAMP levels in MDCK-D1 cells. We chose as an alternate substrate AMP-PNP, which has previously been used as a substrate for adenylyl cyclase assays (28Rodbell M. Birnbaumer L. Pohl S.L. Krans H.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 1877-1882Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and which we found in preliminary studies did not promote indo-resistant cAMP accumulation (following 30 min of treatment of cells with 30 μmAMP-PNP, data not shown). We also found that AMP-PNP yielded linear time- and protein-dependent cAMP generation in MDCK-D1 membranes, whereas MT-ADP and ADPβS, nucleotides that promoted cAMP accumulation in intact cells, did not (data not shown). MT-ADP, ADPβS, and PGE2 all elevated cAMP levels in the presence of AMP-PNP, whereas UTP had no effect (Fig.5). Thus, while MT-ADP and ADPβS lack the ability to serve as substrates for adenylyl cyclase, in combination with AMP-PNP they, like PGE2, are agonists that can increase adenylyl cyclase activity, consistent with activation of P2Y11 receptors linked to Gs. In contrast, UTP, which stimulates Gq-coupled P2Y2 receptors (2Ralevic V. Burnstock G. Pharmacol. Rev. 1998; 50: 413-492PubMed Google Scholar,3Nicholas R.A. Mol.

Taken together with other data shown here, these findings provide direct evidence for P2Y11 receptor-mediated activation of adenylyl cyclase activity. P2Y receptors are increasingly recognized as providing an important means by which extracellular nucleotides regulate a wide variety of cell types (2Ralevic V. Burnstock G. Pharmacol.

Certain of the receptors (e.g.P2Y12, P2Y13) are known to utilize Gi-dependent mechanisms to inhibit cAMP formation (29Communi D. Suarez Gonzalez N. Detheux M. Brezillon S. Lannoy V. Parmentier M.

Early work on MDCK-D1 cells, prior to the molecular cloning and precise identification of the different P2Y receptor subtypes, emphasized the ability of added nucleotides to alter membrane potential, ion flux, or short circuit current (7Lang F.

Insel P.A. Am. J. Physiol. Renal Physiol. 2000; 279: F1045-F1052Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Several lines of evidence from the current studies, designed to identify alternative mechanisms by which ATP might increase cellular cAMP levels, are consistent with the conclusion that MDCK-D1 P2Y11 receptors are responsible for the COX-independent (indo-resistant) increases in cAMP formation promoted by ATP and other nucleotides: 1) the rank order of potency of agonists in promoting this response; 2) the insensitivity to blockade by several P2Y1-selective antagonists; 3) the increased potency of several agonists in P2Y11-overexpressing MDCK-D1 cells; 4) the synergistic enhancement in response by co-incubation of cells with nucleotides plus forskolin; and 5) the ability of two P2Y11 agonists, MT-ADP and ADPβS, to enhance adenylyl cyclase activity in MDCK-D1 cell membranes. Taken together, we believe these results provide strong evidence for P2Y11 receptor-promoted stimulation of adenylyl cyclase activity, presumably secondary to enhanced enzyme activity by receptor-mediated activation of Gs. This is the first data of which we are aware to document that P2Y11 receptors directly activate adenylyl cyclase activity. At the time of the initial cloning of P2Y11receptors, Communi et al. (22Communi D. Govaerts C. Parmentier M. Boeynaems J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31969-31973Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar, 23Communi D. Robaye B. Boeynaems J.M. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1999; 128: 1199-1206Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar) utilized two different cell types to heterologously express the cloned P2Y11 receptors and to conclude that these receptors couple to both Gs and Gq. However, this conclusion was open to alternative interpretations, given the use of different cell types to assess receptor coupling to the different pathways. Data by those workers and others who have reported on the ability of P2Y11 receptors to stimulate cAMP formation (e.g. 24, 34) have involved studies with intact cells, for which the possibility of system-dependent influences has been noted (35Kenakin T. Pharmacol. Rev. 1996; 48: 413-463PubMed Google Scholar, 36Windh R.T. Manning D.R. Methods Enzymol. 2002; 344: 3-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). A number of factors can influence cAMP formation, degradation, or export from cells. Some of those factors are likely to be altered by activation of the Gq-linked pathways, such as [Ca2+], activity of protein kinase C and other downstream kinases (e.g. MAP kinase), and phosphodiesterase activity, etc. Our results that show activation of adenylyl cyclase activity in MDCK-D1 cell membranes provide definitive evidence for the notion that P2Y11 receptors stimulate adenylyl cyclase activity, presumably by direct activation of Gs. The method that we used to draw this conclusion, involving use of AMP-PNP as the substrate for adenylyl cyclase assays, may prove useful to others interested in assessing effects of P2Y11 receptors on adenylyl cyclase activity. Overall, our results provide evidence that ATP and ADP, two physiologic nucleotides that can exist in the extracellular space, are able to raise cAMP levels in native cells via activation of P2Y11 receptors. As such, these results provide a mechanism, in addition to activation of P2Y2 or adenosine receptors, by which exogenous or endogenously released nucleotides can increase cellular levels of this important cyclic nucleotide. Given the evidence that MDCK-D1 and a number of types of cells both release ATP and possess P2Y11 receptors, nucleotide-mediated activation of P2Y11 receptors provides a means for autocrine-paracrine regulation of epithelial and other cell types.

It has also been shown that for full activation, the PH domain of Btk must interact with the lipid product of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (12Salim K.

It has been hypothesized that the function of this interaction is to recruit Btk from the cytosol to the plasma membrane, where it can be subsequently activated by Src family kinases.

For the initiation of arrest of bleeding and subsequent vascular repair, the ability of platelets to adhere to subendothelial structures is critical. Collagen and von Willebrand factor (vWF) form the two most important structures to which platelets adhere through several surface glycoprotein (GP) receptors. These two adhesion molecules induce signaling events in platelets primarily through GP VI and GP Ib-V-IX, respectively. The initial interaction between platelets and vWF occurs via the platelet glycoprotein receptor complex GP Ib-V-IX (GP Ib). vWF supports not only the initial transient phase of platelet adhesion through GP Ib but also mediates integrin αIIbβ3-based cell arrest (17Savage B. Shattil S.J. Ruggeri Z.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 11300-11306Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The signaling pathways induced by GP Ib and GP VI share a number of similarities including constitutive association with and tyrosine phosphorylation of Fc receptor γ chain and recruitment of multiple components of a tyrosine phosphorylation-dependent signaling pathway. These components include Src family kinases, Syk, and phospholipase Cγ2 (18Wu Y. Suzuki-Inoue K. Satoh K. Asazuma N. Yatomi Y. Berndt M.C. Ozaki Y.

In this report, combined activation of GP Ib and GP VI is achieved using the snake venom component alboaggregin A (19Falati S. Edmead C.E. Poole A.W.

It is clear that many aspects of platelet activation are regulated by combined serine/threonine and tyrosine phosphorylation. We were interested in investigating points of cross-talk between these two signaling pathways. Here we have investigated the interaction between a member of the novel PKC isoforms, PKCθ, and Btk and show a role for this interaction in terms of functional feedback between the two kinases. Trimeresurus albolabris venom was a kind gift from Professor R. D. G. Theakston (Liverpool, U. K.). Anti-phosphotyrosine monoclonal antibody 4G10 was from Upstate Biotechnology Inc (TCS Biologicals Ltd., Bucks, U. K.). All anti-PKC antibodies and anti-phosphothreonine were from Transduction Laboratories (Affiniti Research Products, Exeter, U. K.). Anti-Btk antibody was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Src family kinase inhibitor PP1 was from Alexis Corp (Nottingham, U. K.). PKC inhibitor bisindolylmaleimide I (BIM) was from Tocris (Bristol, U. K.). Btk-PH domain construct was from Dr. C. I. E. Smith (Stockholm, Sweden). LFM-A13 and Raytide were from Calbiochem (La Jolla, CA). Plasma vWF was a kind gift from Prof. J. J. Sixma and Dr. T. Vink (Utrecht, The Netherlands). All other reagents were analytical grade. Human blood was drawn from healthy, drug-free volunteers on the day of the experiment. Acid citrate dextrose (120 mm sodium citrate, 110 mm glucose, 80 mm citric acid, used at 1:7 v/v) was used as an anticoagulant. Platelet-rich plasma was prepared by centrifugation at 200 × g for 20 min. Platelets were then isolated by centrifugation of platelet-rich plasma for 10 min at 1,000 × g, in the presence of 40 ng/ml prostaglandin E1. The pellet was resuspended to a density of 4.108 platelets/ml in a modified Tyrode's-HEPES buffer (145 mm NaCl, 2.9 mm KCl, 10 mmHEPES, 1 mm MgCl2, 5 mm glucose, pH 7.3). To this platelet suspension, 10 μm indomethacin was added, and a 30-min resting period was allowed before stimulation. Stimulation of platelets was performed in an aggregometer at 37 °C, with continuous stirring at 800 rpm. Unless otherwise specified, all platelet stimulation occurred in the presence of 1 mm EGTA. Alboaggregin A was prepared from crude T. albolabris venom as described previously (28Peng M. Lu W. Kirby E.P. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 11529-11536Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 29Peng M. Lu W. Kirby E.P. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1992; 67: 702-707Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) by ion exchange chromatography. Alboaggregin A was used at 3.5 μg/ml, a concentration previously determined to be the EC50 value for induction of 5-HT release (19Falati S. Edmead C.E. Poole A.W. Blood. 1999; 94: 1648-1656Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Plasma vWF was used at a concentration of 10 μg/ml (previously shown to give a near maximal aggregatory response), in the presence of 1 mg/ml ristocetin. Reactions were stopped by lysis of platelets with an equal volume of either 2× Nonidet P-40 extraction buffer (1% Nonidet P40, 300 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 mm EDTA, 2 mmNa3VO4, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, pH 7.3), or 2× radioimmune precipitation assay (RIPA) buffer (2% Triton X-100, 2% sodium deoxycholate, 0.2% SDS, 300 mm NaCl, 20 mmTris, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 mmEDTA, 2 mm Na3VO4, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, pH 7.3). Nonidet P-40 was used to preserve protein-protein interaction, and RIPA buffer was used to abolish immunoprecipitation of associated proteins. Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation (13,000 ×g, 5 min). Supernatants were then precleared by incubation with protein A-Sepharose for immunoprecipitations, or glutathione agarose for GST precipitations, for 1 h at 4 °C. For immunoprecipitations, lysates were incubated with protein A-Sepharose plus 1–2 μg of immunoprecipitating antibody for 2 h at 4 °C. For GST precipitations, lysates were incubated with glutathione-agarose beads coupled to GST-Btk-PH for 2 h at 4 °C. Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE on 5–15% gradient slab gels and were then transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane for immunoblotting and detection by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL). Btk or PKCθ was immunoprecipitated from platelets lysed into Nonidet P-40 buffer. Immunoprecipitated proteins were suspended in 20 μl of kinase assay buffer (5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm MnCl2, 100 mm NaCl, 10 μm ATP, 2 mmNa3VO4, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.2), and the reaction was started by the addition of 250 μCi/ml [γ-32P]ATP. After incubation for 10 min at room temperature, the reaction was terminated by the addition of 0.5 ml of ice-cold 100 mm EDTA. Immunoprecipitated proteins were then washed in RIPA buffer before separation by SDS-PAGE and detection of phosphorylated proteins by autoradiography. In addition to autophosphorylation, activity of PKCθ was assayed using MBP as an exogenous substrate. The reaction was carried out as for autophosphorylation but in the presence of 2 μg of MBP/sample. MBP bands were cut out, and the incorporation of 32P was quantified by liquid scintillation counting. Btk activity was also assayed using Raytide as an exogenous substrate. Immunoprecipitated Btk was resuspended in 20 μl of kinase assay buffer, and 10 μg of Raytide was added to each sample. The reaction was started by the addition of 10 μl of ATP buffer (0.15 mm ATP, 30 mmMgCl2, and 200 μCi/ml [γ-32P]ATP in kinase assay buffer). After incubation at 30 °C for 30 min the reaction was terminated by the addition of 10% phosphoric acid. Samples were applied to 2 × 2-cm squares of P81 ion exchange chromatography paper, washed extensively in 0.5% phosphoric acid followed by a wash in acetone. Papers were then dried, and labeled Raytide was quantified by liquid scintillation counting. This was performed as described previously (25Poole A.W. Watson S.P. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1995; 115: 101-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Briefly, 3 μm Fura 2-AM was added to platelet-rich plasma and incubated at 30 °C for 45 min in the presence of 10 μmindomethacin. Platelets were isolated as described above. Platelets were stimulated at room temperature in the absence of EGTA. Fluorescence excitation was made at 340 and 380 nm, and emission at 510 nm was measured using a PerkinElmer Life Sciences LS5 spectrofluorometer. Data are presented as the excitation fluorescence ratio (340:380 nm). Platelets were loaded by incubation of platelet-rich plasma with 0.2 μCi/ml 5-[3H]HT for 1 h at 37 °C. Platelets were preincubated with 1 mm EGTA before stimulation to prevent aggregation. Reactions were terminated by brief microcentrifugation, and 5-[3H]HT released into the supernatant was determined by liquid scintillation counting and expressed as a percentage of the total tissue content, as described previously (30Poole A. Gibbins J.M. Turner M. van Vugt M.J. van de Winkel J.G. Saito T. Tybulewicz V.L. Watson S.P. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2333-2341Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar). Previous studies have shown that collagen and collagen-related peptides acting through GP VI induce tyrosine phosphorylation and activation of Btk (6Oda A. Ikeda Y. Ochs H.D. Druker B.J. Ozaki K. Handa M. Ariga T. Sakiyama Y. Witte O.N. Wahl M.I. Blood. 2000; 95: 1663-1670PubMed Google Scholar, 7Quek L.S. Bolen J. Watson S.P. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 1137-1140Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Fig.1 shows that upon combined stimulation of GP VI and GP Ib with alboaggregin A, Btk became rapidly tyrosine-phosphorylated and associated with a number of tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins when platelets were lysed into Nonidet P-40 (1%). In contrast, these associated proteins were lost when platelets were lysed in the more stringent RIPA lysis buffer. Fig.1 B shows that upon stimulation of platelets with alboaggregin A, one of the Btk-associated proteins was the Fc receptor γ chain, an accessory signaling molecule that has been shown to associate with both GP VI and GP Ib (19Falati S. Edmead C.E. Poole A.W. Blood. 1999; 94: 1648-1656Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 31Gibbins J.M. Okuma M. Farndale R. Barnes M. Watson S.P. FEBS Lett. 1997; 413: 255-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). The Src family kinases Fyn and Lyn have been shown to associate with the GP Ib receptor complex and to be essential for signaling downstream of the receptor (19Falati S. Edmead C.E. Poole A.W. Blood. 1999; 94: 1648-1656Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The Src family kinase inhibitor PP1 is shown in Fig.2 to inhibit tyrosine phosphorylation of Btk dose dependently, with maximal inhibition by 20 μm. The appearance of tyrosine-phosphorylated associated proteins was also markedly reduced by PP1. Fig. 2 also shows that tyrosine phosphorylation of Btk is receptor-specific; stimulation of platelets with plasma vWF and ristocetin also induces tyrosine phosphorylation of Btk in contrast to a lack of response to the G protein-coupled receptor agonist thrombin. Btk has been shown to be activated in platelets after stimulation with collagen and CD32 cross-linking (6Oda A. Ikeda Y. Ochs H.D. Druker B.J. Ozaki K. Handa M. Ariga T. Sakiyama Y. Witte O.N. Wahl M.I. Blood. 2000; 95: 1663-1670PubMed Google Scholar, 7Quek L.S. Bolen J. Watson S.P. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 1137-1140Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Here, Btk activity was assayed in vitro either as autophosphorylation (Fig.3 A) or by phosphorylation of an exogenous peptide substrate, Raytide (Fig. 3 B). Fig.3 A shows that there is kinase activity in samples containing Btk immunoprecipitated from alboaggregin A-stimulated platelets, and a number of proteins became phosphorylated in vitro. After transfer of these proteins to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane and Western blotting, one of these proteins was identified as Btk. Fig. 3,A(iii) and B, shows that activation of platelets with alboaggregin A induces a marked increase in Btk activity, as assayed by phosphorylation of the tyrosine kinase substrate Raytide. The Btk inhibitor LFM-A13 (40 μm) abolished Btk activity when preincubated with platelets before stimulation. Also, preincubation of platelets with the PKC inhibitor BIM caused ablation of Btk activity. Addition of the Src family kinase inhibitor PP1 to the kinase assay buffer caused no change in the measured activity (data not shown), but addition of LFM-A13 to the kinase assay buffer caused ablation of activity, showing that the tyrosine kinase activity measured was the activity of Btk. It has been reported recently that in both platelets and B cells there is a pathway of Ca2+ entry which involves phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate and Btk but is independent of phospholipase C activity (2Fluckiger A.C. Li Z. Kato R.M. Wahl M.I. Ochs H.D. Longnecker R. Kinet J.P. Witte O.N. Scharenberg A.M. Rawlings D.J. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1973-1985Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar, 3Pasquet J.M. Quek L.

Stimulation of platelets with alboaggregin A causes a rise in cytosolic calcium ([Ca2+]i) which is achieved by release of stored calcium and by influx of calcium from the extracellular medium. Fig. 4 i shows that upon incubation of platelets with 40 μm LFM-A13, the profile of the [Ca2+]i rise induced by alboaggregin A stimulation was altered markedly. Although the rapid rise in [Ca2+]i was similar to controls, in LFM-A13-treated platelets the [Ca2+]ideclined from a peak more rapidly than control platelets. In the presence of 1 mm EGTA to chelate extracellular calcium, LFM-A13 had no effect on alboaggregin A-induced calcium response (Fig.4 ii), supporting the hypothesis that Btk regulated calcium entry. LFM-A13 had no effect on the calcium response to thrombin stimulation (Fig. 4 iii). Fig. 4 iv shows the secretion of stored 5-HT in response to alboaggregin A stimulation. 5-HT release was increased by preincubation of platelets with the Btk inhibitor LFM-A13 (40 μm) and was decreased by preincubation with the PKC inhibitor BIM (20 μm). In the presence of both inhibitors, secretion was enhanced relative to control samples but less than that in the presence of LFM-A13 alone. Fig.5 A shows that in addition to tyrosine phosphorylation, alboaggregin A stimulation of platelets induces rapid threonine phosphorylation of Btk, with phosphorylation occurring by 15 s of stimulation and furthermore that this phosphorylation is ablated by preincubating platelets with 20 μm BIM before stimulation. Preincubation of platelets with BIM had no effect on the tyrosine phosphorylation of Btk (data not shown). An association between Btk and PKC has been demonstrated in mast cells (13Yao L. Kawakami Y. Kawakami T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 9175-9179Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar), with the α, β1, β2, ε, and ζ isoforms able to bind to Btk in vitro and the β1 isoform associatingin vivo. In vivo associations between Btk and PKCs ε, ζ, and μ have also been demonstrated in B cells (14Yao L. Suzuki H. Ozawa K. Deng J. Lehel C. Fukamachi H. Anderson W.B. Kawakami Y. Kawakami T. J. Biol.

Using immunoblotting we examined platelet expression of PKC isoforms α, β, γ, δ, ι, ζ, ε, μ, and θ, and in Fig. 5 Bwe demonstrate the presence of all isoforms except ζ. Fig.5 B also examines association between Btk and PKC isoforms and shows that only PKCθ associates with Btk, in an alboaggregin A stimulation-dependent manner. Fig. 5 C shows that PKC θ coprecipitates with Btk from alboaggregin A-stimulated platelets lysed in Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer but not with those lysed in RIPA buffer. RIPA buffer has therefore been used in this study to demonstrate definitively PKCθ phosphorylation in gels where Btk has not been coprecipitated. Fig.6 A shows a time course of stimulation-dependent association between Btk and PKCθ, with association occurring by 15 s stimulation and becoming maximal by 30 s. This association is also induced by stimulation of platelet GP Ib-V-IX with vWF/ristocetin in the presence of 1 mm EGTA to block activation of integrin αIIbβ3.Figure 6Alboaggregin A induces time-dependent association between Btk and PKC θ; association occurs via the PH domain of Btk. Panel A(i), Btk was immunoprecipitated from Nonidet P-40 lysates of basal platelets or platelets stimulated with 3.5 μg/ml alboaggregin A for various time periods as indicated.Panel A(ii), Btk was immunoprecipitated from Nonidet P-40 lysates of basal platelets (WCL), platelets stimulated with alboaggregin A for 60 s, or platelets stimulated with 10 μg/ml plasma vWF and 1 mg/ml ristocetin for 180 s. Samples were Western blotted with anti-PKCθ antibody. Panel B, Nonidet P-40 lysates were prepared from basal platelets or platelets stimulated with 3.5 μg/ml alboaggregin A for various time periods as indicated. GST-Btk-PH coupled to glutathione-agarose beads was used to precipitate associating proteins. Samples, including a whole cell lysate, were Western blotted with anti-PKCθ antibody. Results shown are representative of three independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) It has been shown previously that Btk/PKC association is mediated by interaction between the N-terminal PH domain of Btk and the C1 domain of PKC in mast cell lysates (13Yao L. Kawakami Y. Kawakami T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 9175-9179Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). Fig. 6 B shows that PKCθ associates with the GST-Btk PH domain under basal conditions, and association increases in an alboaggregin A stimulation-dependent manner. Activation of T lymphocytes through the T cell receptor leads to rapid tyrosine phosphorylation of PKCθ (32Liu Y. Witte S. Liu Y.C. Doyle M. Elly C. Altman A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 3603-3609Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Consequently, it was decided to investigate the state of tyrosine phosphorylation of PKCθ in platelets, before and after stimulation with alboaggregin A. As can be seen in Fig. 7 A, PKCθ is not tyrosine-phosphorylated under basal conditions but becomes so upon platelet activation by alboaggregin A by 15 s. As with Btk, the Src family kinase inhibitor PP1 was found to inhibit tyrosine phosphorylation of PKCθ dose-dependently (Fig.7 B). vWF/ristocetin (in the presence of 1 mmEGTA to prevent binding to αIIbβ3) also induced phosphorylation of PKCθ (Fig. 7 B). In addition to Src family kinase inhibition, Btk inhibition with LFM-A13 was also shown to reduce PKCθ tyrosine phosphorylation dose-dependently (Fig. 7 C). PKCθ activity was assayed either as autophosphorylation (Fig.8 A) or as the phosphorylation of MBP, an exogenous PKC substrate (Fig. 8 B). Western blotting revealed that this latter procedure induced no tyrosine phosphorylation of MBP (data not shown), i.e. the activity measured in Fig. 8 B is a serine/threonine kinase. Using either method, stimulation of platelets with alboaggregin A is shown to induce activation of PKCθ. Addition of 20 μm BIM to the kinase assay buffer caused ablation of the measured activity. However, preincubation of platelets with either BIM or LFM-A13 before stimulation with alboaggregin A caused a marked potentiation of PKCθ activity assayed in vitro. Binding of vWF to the GP Ib-V-IX receptor complex and of collagen to GP VI induces a signaling cascade in platelets involving many divergent and convergent pathways including events such as a transient rise in cytosolic calcium levels, hydrolysis of phosphoinositides, synthesis of thromboxane A2, activation of PKC, cytoskeletal reorganization, and the activation of the binding function of integrin αIIbβ3 (22Chow T.W.

https://openalex.org/W1991373413,"Oncogenic Ras and activated forms of the Ras-related protein TC21/R-Ras2 share similar abilities to alter cell proliferation. However, in contrast to Ras, we found previously that TC21 fails to activate the Raf-1 serine/threonine kinase. Thus, TC21 must utilize non-Raf effectors to regulate cell function. In this study, we determined that TC21 interacts strongly with some (RalGDS, RGL, RGL2/Rlf, AF6, and the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) catalytic subunit p110δ), and weakly with other Ras·GTP-binding proteins. In addition, library screening identified novel TC21-interacting proteins. We also determined that TC21, similar to Ras, mediates activation of phospholipase Ce. We then examined if RalGDS, a RalA guanine nucleotide exchange factor, or PI3K are effectors for TC21-mediated signaling and cell proliferation in murine fibroblasts. We found that overexpression of full-length RalGDS reduced the focus forming activity of activated TC21. Furthermore, expression of activated Ras, but not TC21, enhanced GTP loading on RalA. In fact, TC21 attenuated insulin-stimulated RalA·GTP formation. In contrast, like Ras, expression of activated TC21 resulted in membrane translocation and an increase in the PI3K-dependent phosphorylation of Akt, and inhibition of PI3K activity interfered with TC21 focus formation. Finally, unlike Ras, TC21 did not activate the Rac small GTPase, indicating that Ras may not activate Rac by PI3K. Taken together, these results suggest that PI3K, but not RalGDS, is an important mediator of cell proliferation by TC21."

G6PD deficiency is one of the most common mutations in humans and is known to cause health problems for hundreds of millions worldwide. Although it is known that decreased G6PD functionality can result in increased susceptibility to oxidative stress, the molecular targets of this stress are not known. Using a Chinese hamster ovary G6PD-null mutant, we previously demonstrated that exposure to a thiol-specific oxidant, hydroxyethyldisulfide, caused enhanced radiation sensitivity and an inability to repair DNA double strand breaks. We now demonstrate a molecular mechanism for these observations: the direct inhibition of DNA end binding activity of the Ku heterodimer, a DNA repair protein, by oxidation of its cysteine residues. Inhibition of Ku DNA end binding was found to be reversible by treatment of the nuclear extract with dithiothreitol, suggesting that the homeostatic regulation of reduced cysteine residues in Ku is a critical function of G6PD and the oxidative pentose cycle. In summary, we have discovered a new layer of DNA damage repair, that of the functional maintenance of repair proteins themselves. In view of the rapidly escalating number of roles ascribed to Ku, these results may have widespread ramifications.

Genetic defects in G6PD, an X-linked gene, are extremely common, occurring in more than 400 million people throughout the world (11Ruwende C. Hill A.J. Mol.

These G6PD genetic deficiencies result in an impaired ability to deal with oxidative stress and can cause various health problems such as cancer, aging related diseases, etc. (14Cocco P. Todde P.

The best known example for the immediate effect is hemolytic anemia caused by treatment of G6PD-deficient patients with antimalarial drugs (17Baker M.A. Bosia A. Pescarmona G. Turrini F. Arese P. Toxicol. Path. 1984; 12: 331-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). In addition, several studies using cells from G6PD-deficient patients have demonstrated an increased sensitivity of these cells to oxidants, toxins, and oxidative stress (17Baker M.A. Bosia A. Pescarmona G. Turrini F. Arese P. Toxicol. Path. 1984; 12: 331-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The effects of these agents are presumed to be due to the interaction of ROS with macromolecular targets such as DNA, lipid, and protein, but the precise molecular targets are not well defined (17Baker M.A. Bosia A. Pescarmona G. Turrini F. Arese P. Toxicol. Path. 1984; 12: 331-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 18Efferth T. Fabry U. Glatte P. Osieka R. J. Mol.

A recent study has demonstrated that the majority of patients with acute non-lymphocytic leukemia have decreased G6PD levels (16Devi G.S. Prasad M.H. Reddy P.P. Rao D.N. Indian J. Exp. Biol. 1997; 35: 155-158PubMed Google Scholar). This study also reported the association of a high percentage of chromosomal abnormalities, lower survival, and higher remission rates in patients having decreased G6PD activity versus normal, respectively. Although some studies have indicated that there was no difference in cancer risk among G6PD-deficient versus G6PD-normal subjects, this study showed a significant increase in mortality from non-Hodgkin's lymphoma in G6PD-deficient subjects (14Cocco P. Todde P. Fornera S. Manca M.B. Manca P. Sias A.R. Blood. 1998; 91: 706-709Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In a related animal study, Wells et al. (15Wells P.G. Kim P.M. Laposa R.R. Nicol C.J. Parman T. Winn L.M. Mutat. Res. 1997; 396: 65-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar) demonstrated that G6PD-deficient mice had enhanced embryopathies, indicating a teratological role for endogenous oxidative stress caused by the absence of G6PD. In their review, Martini and Ursini (20Martini G. Ursini M.V. Bioessays. 1996; 18: 631-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) have suggested that the high prevalence of G6PD deficiency in various ethnic populations may allow the putative role of G6PD deficiency in carcinogenesis and aging to be ascertained. We have recently demonstrated that the Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) G6PD-null mutant has enhanced radiation sensitivity and an inability to repair DNA double strand breaks (DSBs) after oxidative stress induced by hydroxyethyldisulfide (HEDS), a thiol-specific oxidant (21Ayene I.S. Koch C.J. Tuttle S.W. Stamato T.D. Perez M.L. Biaglow J.E. Int. J. Radiat. Biol. 2000; 76: 1523-1531Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Here we demonstrate that a reasonable molecular mechanism for its defective DNA DSB repair is the inhibition of the DNA end binding activity of the Ku heterodimer, a DNA repair protein, due to the oxidation of its cysteine residues. Our reason for investigating the Ku protein is that it plays a central role in DNA damage recognition and non-homologous DNA end joining by binding to DNA ends in mammalian cells (22Featherstone C. Jackson S.P. Mutat. Res. 1999; 434: 3-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar, 23Manis J.P. Gu Y. Lansford R. Sonoda E. Ferrini R. Davidson L. Rajewsky K. Alt F.W.J. J. Exp.

Ku is also believed to be involved in the regulation of apoptosis and telomere fusion (25Ajmani A.K. Satoh M. Reap E. Cohen P.L. Reeves W.H. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 181: 2049-2058Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 26Hsu H.L. Gilley D. Galande S.A. Hande M.P. Allen B. Kim S.H. Li G.C. Campisi J. Kohwi-Shigematsu T. Chen D.J. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2807-2812Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). Our present results demonstrate that G6PD deficiencies cause not only susceptibility to oxidative damage in general but also the specific oxidation of proteins critical for maintaining proper cellular functions, such as DNA repair. The cell lines were derived from the K1 clone of CHO cells as described previously (27Tuttle S.W. Stamato T. Perez M.L. Biaglow J.E. Radiat. Res. 2000; 153: 781-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Briefly, G6PD-null mutants of CHO cells were isolated after mutagenesis with a minimally toxic concentration of ethylmethanesulfonate by means of the selection technique coupled with histochemical staining for enzyme activity. Cell transfections to reintroduce the G6PD gene were carried out by the electroporation of G6PD-null mutant cells with hamster G6PD-cDNA (GenBankTM accession number AF044676) inserted into pcDNA3.1 constructs and selected in G418 medium. Target clones were identified by histochemical staining for G6PD activity and Northern analysis using G6PD-cDNA (25Ajmani A.K. Satoh M. Reap E. Cohen P.L. Reeves W.H. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 181: 2049-2058Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The A1A cells are stably transfected with a vector resistant to G418. We have also selected several clones with differing and similar G6PD activity to normal cells (27Tuttle S.W. Stamato T. Perez M.L. Biaglow J.E. Radiat. Res. 2000; 153: 781-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Cells (0.8 × 106) in 4 ml of medium were plated in 60-mm dishes on the day before treatment with HEDS. HEDS exposure was effected by replenishing the cells with 1 ml of fresh medium plus 50 μl of 0.1 m HEDS. The dishes were swirled every 5 min during the 1-h incubation time at 37 °C in a humidified 5% CO2 incubator as described previously (21Ayene I.S. Koch C.J. Tuttle S.W. Stamato T.D. Perez M.L. Biaglow J.E. Int. J. Radiat. Biol. 2000; 76: 1523-1531Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Cells looked morphologically normal after HEDS treatment. The cells were harvested using a Teflon cell scraper after rinsing three times with 3 ml of ice-cold PBS. They were then centrifuged, resuspended, and washed twice with 4 ml of ice-cold PBS. The washed cells were resuspended gently by flicking the sample tubes in 400 μl of cold hypotonic lysis buffer (pH 7.9) containing 10 mm Hepes, 1.5 mmMgCl2, 10 mm KCl, leupeptin (2.5 μg/ml), 0.2 mm PMSF, and pepstatin (1 μg/ml) and incubated on ice for 10 min. Cells swollen by this procedure were vortexed (10 s) and then centrifuged at 14,000 rpm in a microcentrifuge for 10 s. The nuclear pellet was resuspended in 30 μl of high salt extraction buffer (pH 7.9) containing 20 mm Hepes, 25% glycerol, 420 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, leupeptin (2.5 μg/ml), 0.2 mm PMSF, and pepstatin (1 μg/ml) and incubated on ice for 20 min. Cellular debris was removed by centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 2 min at 4 °C. Our method involves an extraction of pyridine nucleotides by 70% methanol directly added to the cells after two rinses with ice-cold PBS. Reduced pyridine nucleotides were quantified by a modified method of Noack et al. (28Noack H. Kunz W.S. Augustin W. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 202: 162-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) using an HPLC with fluorescence detection (Waters 474) at an excitation and emission wavelength of 340 and 455 nm, respectively. NADPH and NADH were eluted with 0.1 m KH2PO4 (pH 6.1) using a step gradient of methanol; 5 min, 0% CH3OH; 6 min, 4% CH3OH; 5 min, 12% CH3OH; 14 min, 40% CH3OH. The data were collected and analyzed using Jasco Borwin software. Concentrations of the intracellular and extracellular thiols, glutathione, and mercaptoethanol were quantified by an HPLC with electrochemical detection (21Ayene I.S. Koch C.J. Tuttle S.W. Stamato T.D. Perez M.L. Biaglow J.E. Int. J. Radiat. Biol. 2000; 76: 1523-1531Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The mobile phase was 100 mm phosphate (pH 2.0) with 15% methanol in a reversed phase C-18 column (Alltech Altima). To quantify extracellular thiols, 0.5 ml of the extracellular medium from the dish was transferred to a microcentrifuge tube containing an equal volume of sulfosalicyclic acid (SSA) lysis buffer (100 mm SSA, 0.1 mmdiethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid, 0.1 mmdiethyldithiocarbamic acid, and 0.1 mm EDTA). After decanting the remaining medium, the cells were rinsed three times with ice-cold PBS. To quantify intracellular thiols, attached cells were lysed with 0.5 ml of ice-cold SSA lysis buffer and 0.5 ml of water. After 15 min on ice, the cells were scraped with a Teflon spatula. Both the extracellular and intracellular extracts were transferred to microcentrifuge tubes and centrifuged at high speed in a Fisher 59A microcentrifuge followed by analysis of the supernatant. Cells attached to the dishes were incubated with HEDS for the desired time. These cells were then washed three times with ice-cold PBS and then treated with SSA as above. This treatment precipitates cellular macromolecules in place without loss of protein. The acid was removed, and dishes were washed two more times with 5 ml of SSA, which was removed by aspiration. Under these experimental conditions, only non-protein sulfhydryl groups were washed off the cells. Acid-fixed cells were then incubated with 1 ml of 100 mm phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) containing 1.5 mm 5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) for 15 min at 37 °C, and the absorbance was read at 412 nm. Protein thiols were then estimated using an absorption coefficient for reduced 5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) of 13,600 at 412 nm. The protein thiol level in untreated cells was 0.040 ± 0.002 pmol/cell. A 144-base pair probe was prepared from a pUC18 plasmid using PvuII and EcoRI digestion and purified by 10% preparative gel electrophoresis (29Getts R.C. Stamato T.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15981-15984Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The appropriate 144-base pair fragment was excised and eluted from the gel into 100 mm NaCl in TE buffer (10 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 0.1 mm EDTA). The eluted DNA was extracted with phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1), ethanol-precipitated, and resuspended in TE buffer. The 144-bp fragment was labeled with [α-32P]dATP (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) using the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I. Unincorporated nucleotide was removed by chromatography on Sephadex G-50 spin columns. Mobility shift mixtures containing 2 μg of nuclear protein, 1 ng of32P-labeled 144-bp probe, and 1 μg of pUC18 (nonspecific DNA competitor) in a final volume of 20 μl of binding buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 0.1 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm PMSF, leupeptin (2.5 μg/ml) and pepstatin (1 μg/ml), and 10% v/v glycerol) were incubated for 15 min at room temperature (29Getts R.C. Stamato T.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15981-15984Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For mobility supershift assays, a Ku70 antibody (29Getts R.C. Stamato T.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15981-15984Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was incubated with the nuclear extract for 30 min at the desired concentration after the 15-min incubation with the radioactive probe and pUC18. The mixtures were electrophoresed on a 6% polyacrylamide gel at 20–25 mA in TBE buffer (45 mmTris-HCl (pH 8.0), 45 mm boric acid, 1 mmEDTA), and the gel was dried and subjected to autoradiography or phosphorimaging and NIH image analysis for quantitation (Bio-Rad). A total cellular Ku70 protein was quantified using Western blot and NIH image analysis. Cells were rinsed with PBS three times and mixed with 200 μl of room temperature-cooled, preboiled (2 min) Laemmli buffer containing 10 mm dithiothreitol (DTT). Cells in Laemmli buffer were removed using a Teflon scraper and transferred to an Eppendorf tube using a micropipette. The cells were homogenized using a 1-ml syringe (18-gauge needle), and samples were stored at −80 °C. Protein extracts (15 μg/ml) in sample buffer were electrophoresed on a 7.5% precast gel from Bio-Rad at 150 V for 75 min in TBE buffer (45 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.8), 45 mm boric acid, 1 mm EDTA). The proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose by electrophoresis at 100 V for 60 min. The nitrocellulose paper was incubated in 10 ml of blocking buffer for 1.5 h at room temperature on a rocker and stored in the cold room overnight. The nitrocellulose paper was washed five times with TBST (20 mm Tris base (pH 7.6), 137 mm NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20) and incubated with 38 μl of primary Ku (p70) antibody (Ab-4, clone N3H10, Neomarkers) in 15 ml of blocking buffer for 2 h at room temperature. The nitrocellulose paper was washed 4 times with TBST before incubation with the secondary antibody for 1 h per the manufacturer's instruction (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.). The bands were detected and quantified using a standard ECL kit and NIH image analysis, respectively. The NADPH value for untreated G6PD-null mutant E89 cells (∼60 pmol/106 cells) was about 40% lower than that of wild-type K1 (∼90 pmol/106 cells) and transfectant A1A (∼100 pmol/106 cells) cells (Fig.1). NADH values (∼800 pmol/106 cells) were the same in all three cell lines (Fig.2). Incubation of these cells with 5 mm HEDS for 1 h caused a 5-fold decrease in NADH in E89 cells with little change for K1 and A1A cells (Fig. 2). This treatment almost completely eliminated the NADPH levels in E89 cells (Fig. 1) and decreased that of K1 and A1A cells by 90% (Fig. 1).Figure 2Estimation of intracellular NADH in K1 (wild-type), E89 (G6PD-null mutant), and A1A (G6PD-transfected E89) cells incubated for 1 h in the presence and absence of 5 mm HEDS at 37 °C. The NADH values per million cells are similar for untreated K1 (836 pmol), E89 (721 pmol), and A1A (827 pmol) cells. The NADH values for K1, E89, and A1A cells after a 1-h incubation with 5 mm HEDS changed to 782, 146, and 1080 pmol, respectively. Each experiment was repeated at least three times with errors as shown, and the values represent units per million cells.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To measure bioreductive capacity, we quantified the extracellular mercaptoethanol produced by cells treated with 5 mm HEDS immediately after a 1-h incubation (Fig.3). The wild-type K1 cells released 522 nmol of ME into the extracellular medium. G6PD-deficient E89 cells released 53 nmol of ME, which is a 10-fold decrease in bioreductive capacity compared with K1 cells. The G6PD-transfected A1A cells released 815 nmol of ME, indicating the recovery of bioreductive capacity due to the transfection of the wild-type G6PD gene into the null mutant cells. The intracellular GSH level was almost the same in untreated wild-type (13 nmol), null mutant (18 nmol), and transfectant (16 nmol) cells (Fig. 4). The incubation of HEDS for 1 h did not significantly affect the GSH levels in wild-type (12 nmol) or transfectant (17 nmol) cells. However, the GSH levels in G6PD-null mutant cells decreased from 18 to 2.0 nmol (9-fold decrease) after a 1-h incubation with HEDS. The effect of HEDS on protein thiols was measured by using Ellman's reagent (Fig.5). All three untreated cell lines had similar amounts of intracellular PSH (∼42 nmol/106cells). G6PD-null mutants treated with 5 mm HEDS showed a significant decrease (30%) in PSH compared with untreated E89 cells. However, wild-type K1 and A1A transfectants showed an insignificant decrease (7%) in protein thiols after HEDS treatment (Fig. 5).Figure 4Estimation of intracellular GSH in K1(wild-type), E89 (G6PD-null mutant), and A1A (G6PD-transfected E89) cells incubated for 1 h in the presence and absence of 5 mm HEDS at 37 °C.

Stamato T.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15981-15984Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This assay contains a32P-labeled 144-bp DNA probe, a nuclear extract, and an excess of circular plasmid DNA. Under these assay conditions, proteins that bind to internal DNA sequences will be bound by the excess unlabeled plasmid DNA that does not contain ends. Thus, only proteins that specifically bind to DNA ends will bind to the labeled probe. DTT, a strong reducing agent, is normally added to protein extracts to protect against spontaneous oxidation. To measure the effect of oxidation on end binding activity in vivo, it was necessary to determine whether DTT could be eliminated from the assay because its presence would be likely to reverse such oxidation. Therefore, we compared DNA end binding activity with and without DTT for nuclear proteins extracted from wild-type (K1) cells, G6PD-null mutant (E89) cells, and G6PD-null mutant cells stably transfected with a cDNA encoding the wild-type hamster G6PD (A1A). The NIH image analysis of labeled bands (Fig. 6, plots 2–7) shows that similar amounts of DNA end binding activity (Ku-DNA complex) were observed in nuclear extracts isolated from cells in the presence or absence of DTT. Authentication of Ku as the DNA end binding species was made by demonstrating a supershift of the bound probe upon addition of the anti-Ku70 antibody to the reaction mixture (Fig. 6, lanes 8–10). Having demonstrated that Ku binding was not affected by the absence of DTT in this assay, we examined the effect of HEDS treatment on Ku binding in the same three cell lines. HEDS treatment inhibited Ku DNA end binding activity by 70% in the G6PD-null mutant E89 cells (Fig.7, lane 5). In contrast, HEDS had no effect on Ku DNA end binding activity in the wild-type cell line K1 or the G6PD+ transfectant A1A (Fig. 7, lanes 3 and 7). To ensure that the inhibition of Ku DNA end binding observed in HEDS-treated cells was not due to a decrease in the Ku protein, we measured the amount of Ku70 by Western blot analysis using a monoclonal anti-Ku70 antibody. A single ∼70-kDa immunoreactive band of equal intensity was observed in total cell lysates extracted from all three cell lines treated with and without HEDS (Fig.8). This indicates that treatment with 5 mm HEDS had no measurable effect on the amount of Ku70 in any of the CHO cell lines. These results support the hypothesis that HEDS-induced oxidation of Ku leading to reduced end binding activity was responsible for the previously observed increase in radiation sensitivity and reduction in DSB repair in G6PD-null mutant cells (21Ayene I.S. Koch C.J. Tuttle S.W. Stamato T.D. Perez M.L. Biaglow J.E. Int. J. Radiat. Biol. 2000; 76: 1523-1531Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). To determine whether the effect of HEDS on Ku extracted from G6PD-null mutant cells was a direct consequence of thiol oxidation, we treated the nuclear extract with the thiol-specific reductant, DTT. Ku DNA end binding activity was fully restored by treating the lysates from HEDS-treated G6PD-null mutant cells with 5 mm DTT for 10 min (Fig. 9, lane 5). Ku DNA end binding activity in lysates from G6PD-null mutant cells that had not been exposed to HEDS was not affected by DTT. Taken together, the results indicate that HEDS blocks Ku DNA end binding activity in vivo through the oxidation of cysteine residues in the Ku heterodimer without affecting the protein level because this oxidation can be reversed by reduction of cysteine residues by DTT. The fact that Ku was not affected by HEDS treatment in G6PD-proficient cells suggests that homeostatic regulation of cysteine residues in Ku is a critical function of G6PD and the oxidative pentose cycle. A major biochemical function of G6PD is that it acts as the rate-limiting enzyme of the oxidative pentose phosphate cycle. The enzymes of the OPPC are highly conserved and ubiquitously expressed in prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells, indicating the importance of this pathway for cell growth and function (5Spolarics Z. J.

We found that ATRA induced the 4-fold elevation of acid sphingomyelinase (ASMase) activity 24 h after treatment in NB4 cells, but not in NB4/RA cells. ATRA did not affect neutral sphingomyelinase activity in either NB4 or NB4/RA. Upon treatment with ATRA, ceramide, the product of an ASMase reaction, accumulated in NB4 cells. Northern blot analysis showed a marked elevation of the ASMase mRNA 8 h after ATRA treatment, reaching a plateau at 24 h. Regulation ofASMase gene expression was studied by a promoter analysis using luciferase reporter assay. The 5′-upstream flanking region of human ASMase gene (−519/+300) conjugated with theluciferase gene was introduced into COS-7 cells. Luciferase activity in transformed cells markedly increased in response to ATRA stimulation when the wild type RARα or the PML/RARα hybrid protein was co-expressed. Deletion experiments revealed that a short sequence at the 5′-end (−519/−485) was indispensable for the ATRA response. Within this short region, two retinoic acid-responsive element-like motifs (TGCCCG and TCTCCT) and one AP2-like motif (CCCTTCCC) were identified. Deletion and base-substitution experiments showed that all three motifs are required for the full expression induced by ATRA. Electrophoresis mobility shift assays with the nuclear extract of ATRA-treated NB4 cells showed that proteins were bound specifically to the probe being mediated by all three motifs in the promoter sequence.

Regulation ofASMase gene expression was studied by a promoter analysis using luciferase reporter assay. The 5′-upstream flanking region of human ASMase gene (−519/+300) conjugated with theluciferase gene was introduced into COS-7 cells. Luciferase activity in transformed cells markedly increased in response to ATRA stimulation when the wild type RARα or the PML/RARα hybrid protein was co-expressed. Deletion experiments revealed that a short sequence at the 5′-end (−519/−485) was indispensable for the ATRA response. Within this short region, two retinoic acid-responsive element-like motifs (TGCCCG and TCTCCT) and one AP2-like motif (CCCTTCCC) were identified. Deletion and base-substitution experiments showed that all three motifs are required for the full expression induced by ATRA. Electrophoresis mobility shift assays with the nuclear extract of ATRA-treated NB4 cells showed that proteins were bound specifically to the probe being mediated by all three motifs in the promoter sequence. acid sphingomyelinase neutral sphingomyelinase acute promyelocytic leukemia all-trans-retinoic acid 9-cis-retinoic acid 13-cis-retinoic acid 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate 1α,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 retinoic acid receptor retinoid X receptor retinoic acid responsible element electrophoresis mobility shift assay nitro blue tetrazolium activation function acute promyelocytic leukemia Extensive reports have suggested the significance of sphingomyelin metabolism in the intracellular signal transduction that leads cells to apoptosis, differentiation, or proliferation (1Kolesnick R.

Buechler C. Ries S. Schaeffler A. Aslanidis C. Schuierer M. Weiler M. Sandhoff K. de Jong P.J. Schmitz G. J.

J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15399-15402Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The pleiotropic effects of retinoids are mediated through two classes of receptors, retinoic acid receptor (RAR) and retinoid X receptor (RXR) which belong to the superfamily of ligand-inducible transcription factors including steroid hormone, thyroid hormone and vitamin D3 receptors (12Umesono K. Murakami K.K. Thompson C.C. Evans R.M. Cell. 1991; 65: 1255-1266Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1488) Google Scholar). The RAR receptors (RARα, -β, -γ, and their isoforms) are activated by both all-trans(ATRA)-and 9-cis (9-cis-RA)-retinoic acids, whereas RXR receptors (RXRα, -β, -γ) are activated exclusively by 9-cis-RA (13Chambon P. Gene (Amst.). 1993; 135: 223-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). RAR and RXR contain two regions of transcriptional activation functions (AFs) located in the N-terminal A/B region (AF1) and in the C-terminal ligand-binding E region (AF2), which may synergistically, and to some extent differentially, activate various retinoic acid-responsive promoters (13Chambon P. Gene (Amst.). 1993; 135: 223-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The activation of retinoic acid-responsive promoters most likely occurs through RAR/RXR heterodimers rather than through each homodimer. The heterodimer activated by ATRA or 9-cis-RA, specifically binds to retinoic acid-responsive elements (RARE) in the 5′-promoter regions of targeting genes, and activates the promoters' activity (14Nagpal S. Friant S. Nakshatri H. Chambon P. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2349-2360Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar, 15Naar A.M. Boutin J.M. Lipkin S.M. Yu V.C. Holloway J.M. Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Cell. 1991; 65: 1267-1279Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar).Acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) is characterized by a reciprocal chromosomal translocation, t(15:17) that fuses the PML gene with the RARα gene and generates a chimericPML-RARα (16Melnick A. Licht J.D. Blood. 1999; 93: 3167-3215Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The fusion protein carries the functional domains of RARα including both DNA- and ligand-binding domains, and retains the ability to respond to ATRA (16Melnick A. Licht J.D. Blood. 1999; 93: 3167-3215Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) that has been known to bring remission in APL patients by inducing the differentiation of leukemic cells (17Fenaux P. Degos L. N. Engl. J. Med. 1997; 337: 1076-1077Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Elucidation of the molecular mechanism of ATRA-induced APL cell differentiation is thus important for developing a differentiation chemotherapy. There are several useful cell lines for analysis of the molecular mechanism of ATRA-induced APL cell differentiation (18Lanotte M. Martin-Thouvenin V. Najman S. Balerini P. Valensi F. Berger R. Blood. 1991; 77: 1080-1086Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19Kizaki M. Matsushita H. Takayama N. Muto A. Ueno H. Awaya N. Kawai Y. Asou H. Kamada N. Ikeda Y. Blood. 1996; 88: 1824-1833Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). NB4 is a cell line derived from an APL patient and its myeloid differentiation is induced by ATRA. The ATRA-resistant NB4 subclone NB4/RA has a Pro(CCG) to Leu(CTG) substitution at codon 900 (type L) in the AF2 domain of RARα (20Kitamura K. Kiyoi H. Yoshida H. Saito H. Ohno R. Naoe T. Leukemia. 1997; 11: 1950-1956Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The resulting PML-RARα fusion of NB4/RA protein no longer retains ATRA-binding capacity.In the present study, we found the ATRA-dependent elevation of ASMase activity in NB4 accompanied by an increase in intracellular ceramide. Analyses of the 5′-promoter region of the ASMasegene revealed the presence of functional ATRA responsive motifs and AP2-like sequence. Although one of the important roles of ATRA is well known to be the induction of differentiation in a variety of tumor cell lines (21Smith M.A. Parkinson D.R. Cheson B.D. Friedman M.A. J. Clin. Oncol. 1992; 10: 839-864Crossref PubMed Scopus (527) Google Scholar), less information is available on the involvement of ASMase or ceramide in ATRA-induced cell differentiation. This report describes the molecular mechanism of the ATRA-dependent induction of ASMase and suggests the possible involvement of ASMase in ATRA-induced APL cell differentiation.DISCUSSIONIn 1989, Okazaki et al. (29Okazaki T. Bell R.M. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 19076-19080Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) first proposed a novel signaling pathway, termed the sphingomyelin cycle which is induced by Vit D3 in HL-60 cells. Ceramide produced by NSMase activated by Vit D3 functions as a lipid mediator/second messenger in HL-60 cell differentiation (30Okazaki T. Bielawska A. Bell R.M. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 15823-15831Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Since then, numerous works have demonstrated the key role of ceramide in signal transduction, which leads cells to proliferation, differentiation, cell cycle arrest, or apoptotic death (1Kolesnick R. Hannun Y.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 224-225Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar, 2Riboni L. Viani P. Bassi R. Prinetti A. Tettamanti G. Prog. Lipid Res. 1997; 36: 153-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 3Huwilera A. Kolterb T. Pfeilschiftera J. Sandhoff K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1485: 63-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar). Besides Vit D3, a variety of other agents such as tumor necrosis factor α, nerve growth factor, interleukin-1, and progesterone have been proposed as inducers of cell differentiation as well as stimulators of ceramide production through activation of sphingomyelin hydrolysis (4Levade T. Jaffrezou J.P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1438: 1-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar).Some reports suggested ceramide to be the functional molecule in ATRA-inducible cell differentiation (31Bertolaso L. Gibellini D. Secchiero P. Previati M. Falgione D. Visani G. Rizzoli R. Capitani S. Zauli G. Br. J. Haematol. 1998; 100: 541-549Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 32Riboni L. Prinetti A. Bassi R.

Rizzoli R. Capitani S. Zauli G. Br. J. Haematol. 1998; 100: 541-549Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) showed that the accumulation of both ceramide and catalytically active protein kinase C-ζ in nuclei plays a key role in the induction of granulocytic differentiation of HL-60 by ATRA. Riboniet al. (32Riboni L. Prinetti A. Bassi R. Caminiti A. Tettamanti G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26868-26875Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar) reported the important contribution of two metabolic pathways, de novo ceramide biosynthesis and sphingomyelin degradation by NSMase in the differentiation of neuroblastoma Neuro2A cells by ATRA. In the present study, we investigated the relationship between ATRA-induced myeloid differentiation of APL cells and the function of ASMase in terms of gene transcription, ASMase activity, and the increase in intracellular ceramide content, using two cell lines, ATRA-responsive NB4 and its mutant, ATRA-resistant NB4/RA.NB4 has a chromosomal translocation, t(15;17) and generates the PML-RARα fusion protein. PML-RARα retains an active ligand-receptor domain (AF2) for ATRA (11Gudas L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15399-15402Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Under the pharmacological concentration of ATRA, NB4 differentiates toward myeloid-like cells at 70% efficiency 5 days after ATRA treatment (Fig. 1 A). On the other hand, NB4 subclone NB4/RA did not show ATRA-dependent differentiation as reported by Kitamura et al. (20Kitamura K. Kiyoi H. Yoshida H. Saito H. Ohno R. Naoe T. Leukemia. 1997; 11: 1950-1956Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1 B). ASMase activity of NB4 began to increases 8 h after ATRA treatment and reached a plateau at 24 h, (but not of NB4/RA) (Fig. 2). 9-cis-RA, which activates RARα and induces myeloid differentiation of NB4 at the same efficiency as ATRA (20Kitamura K. Kiyoi H. Yoshida H. Saito H. Ohno R. Naoe T. Leukemia. 1997; 11: 1950-1956Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), also increased the ASMase activity of NB4 but not of NB4/RA (Fig. 3). Interestingly, TPA increased the ASMase activities of both NB4 and NB/RA (Fig. 3). These results suggest that the ASMase induction in ATRA-treated NB4 depends on an ATRA receptor, RARα which is activated either by binding of ATRA or by 9-cis-RA, and that TPA induces ASMase activity through any RARα- independent pathway in either NB4 or NB4/RA, as reported by Langmann et al.(10Langmann T. Buechler C. Ries S. Schaeffler A. Aslanidis C. Schuierer M. Weiler M. Sandhoff K. de Jong P.J. Schmitz G. J. Lipid Res. 1999; 40: 870-880Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).We also found an ATRA-dependent increase ofASMase mRNA in NB4 by Northern blot analysis (Fig. 5), suggesting the existence of RARE site(s) in the putative 5′-promoter region of the ASMase gene. Luciferase reporter assay showed the existence of a RARE site in the 5′-region, −519 to −411 of theASMase gene (Fig. 7). By a homology search of the DNA sequence of −519 to −411, we found RARE-like sites, TGCCCG (A motif) (−513 to −508) and TCTCCT (B motif) (−499 to −494) which closely resembled the core motifs of new RAREs reported by Panariello et al. (28Panariello L. Quadro L. Trematerra S. Colantuoni V. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25524-25532Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) and Naltner et al. (26Naltner A. Ghaffari M. Whitsett J.A. Yan C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 56-62Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Luciferase reporter assay as well as EMSA showed the involvement of A and B sites in the activation of the ASMase gene promoter (Figs. 8 and 9). Furthermore, the additional involvement of AP2-like motif (−488 to −481, CCCTTCCC) was suggested (Figs. 8 B and 10), just like the thyroid transcription factor-1 site which is a tissue-specific factor and stimulates human surfactant protein B promoter with the clustered RAREs, TGCCCT, and TGTCCT (26Naltner A. Ghaffari M. Whitsett J.A. Yan C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 56-62Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Interestingly, AP2 is also reported to be a retinoic acid-inducible and cell-type specific transcription factor (35Williams T. Admon A. Luscher B. Tjian R. Genes Dev. 1988; 2: 1557-1569Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar, 36Williams T. Tjian R. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 670-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar).Which proteins bind to RARE sites of ASMase 5′-promoter region remains to be determined. Besides its basic function as a transcription factor, RARα may function as a tethering protein,i.e. recruiting nuclear receptor co-activators in the presence of ATRA. DRIP/TRAP, which is a large macromolecular complex containing at least 15 nuclear receptor coactivators, depends on ATRA in binding to the retinoid receptor of NB4 (37Shao W. Rosenauer A. Mann K. Chang C.P. Rachez C. Freedman L.P. Miller W.H. Blood. 2000; 96: 2233-2239Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, it is feasible that a DRIP/TRAP-like large co-activator complex is recruited by ATRA-activated RARα, and that it binds to the 5′-promoter region of the ASMase gene. In accord with this hypothesis, we found that at least three elements (A, B and AP2 motifs) are responsible for the transcriptional activation of the ASMase gene. According to this scenario, anti-RARα antibody could inhibit the complex formation (Fig. 9 C) either by inhibiting the DNA binding activity of RARα, or by blocking the interaction sites of RARα with the co-activators.In the present study, the participation of RXR and PML in theASMase gene expression remains unknown. Activation of ATRA-responsive promoters most likely occurs through RAR/RXR heterodimers rather than through RAR or RXR homodimers (14Nagpal S. Friant S. Nakshatri H. Chambon P. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2349-2360Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar, 15Naar A.M. Boutin J.M. Lipkin S.M. Yu V.C. Holloway J.M. Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Cell. 1991; 65: 1267-1279Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar). In a transient transfection assay, we used either one of two plasmids,RARα or RARα/PML, as a receptor source. Although cells may show ectopic expression of homodimers, luciferase activity is increased by the addition of ATRA. It is uncertain whether the endogenous RXR in COS-7 combines with the transfected RARα or PML/RARα to induce luciferase activation, or whether RARα homodimer induces it.In 99% of APL, RARα is fused to the PML leading to the production of a PML-RARα chimeric protein (38de The H. Chomienne C. Lanotte M. Degos L. Dejean A. Nature. 1990; 347: 558-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (1184) Google Scholar). We showed that the transfection of the RARα gene as well as PML/RARα gene to COS-7 induced the activation of luciferase reporter gene by an ATRA addition (Fig. 6). We have also observed the ATRA-induced elevation of ASMase activity in the human hepatoma cell line, Hep G2, under a low concentration of fetal calf serum (data not shown). These results suggest that the ATRA-dependent activation of the ASMase gene transcription might be due to RARα, and that PML may not be responsible for the ASMase induction.It is of great interest to know whether ATRA-induced ASMase is directly involved in the myeloid differentiation process. Sphingoid molecules have been known to modulate the expression of various genes such as c-myc, c-jun, c-fos, andbcl-2 during the fundamental cellular processes of cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis (2Riboni L. Viani P. Bassi R. Prinetti A. Tettamanti G. Prog. Lipid Res. 1997; 36: 153-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). In a model membrane system, ceramide showed a unique capacity to spontaneously self-aggregate into a microdomain such as a caveolae or raft (39Veiga M.P. Arrondo J.L. Goni F.M. Alonso A. Biophys. J. 1999; 76: 342-350Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). In addition, in model membranes ceramide-rich microdomains tend to fuse rafts to form larger platforms (40Holopainen J.M. Subramanian M. Kinnunen P.K. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 17562-17570Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). This raises the possibility that the increase in cellular ceramide in ATRA-treated NB4 cells might induce the reorganization of a signaling structure in the microdomain. We propose that ASMase induction and the resultant ceramide production play a key role in the differentiation process of the NB4 cell line. Extensive reports have suggested the significance of sphingomyelin metabolism in the intracellular signal transduction that leads cells to apoptosis, differentiation, or proliferation (1Kolesnick R. Hannun Y.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 224-225Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar, 2Riboni L. Viani P. Bassi R. Prinetti A. Tettamanti G. Prog.

Acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) is characterized by a reciprocal chromosomal translocation, t(15:17) that fuses the PML gene with the RARα gene and generates a chimericPML-RARα (16Melnick A. Licht J.D. Blood. 1999; 93: 3167-3215Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The fusion protein carries the functional domains of RARα including both DNA- and ligand-binding domains, and retains the ability to respond to ATRA (16Melnick A. Licht J.D. Blood. 1999; 93: 3167-3215Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) that has been known to bring remission in APL patients by inducing the differentiation of leukemic cells (17Fenaux P. Degos L. N. Engl. J. Med. 1997; 337: 1076-1077Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Elucidation of the molecular mechanism of ATRA-induced APL cell differentiation is thus important for developing a differentiation chemotherapy. There are several useful cell lines for analysis of the molecular mechanism of ATRA-induced APL cell differentiation (18Lanotte M. Martin-Thouvenin V. Najman S. Balerini P. Valensi F. Berger R. Blood. 1991; 77: 1080-1086Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19Kizaki M. Matsushita H. Takayama N. Muto A. Ueno H. Awaya N. Kawai Y. Asou H. Kamada N. Ikeda Y. Blood. 1996; 88: 1824-1833Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). NB4 is a cell line derived from an APL patient and its myeloid differentiation is induced by ATRA. The ATRA-resistant NB4 subclone NB4/RA has a Pro(CCG) to Leu(CTG) substitution at codon 900 (type L) in the AF2 domain of RARα (20Kitamura K. Kiyoi H. Yoshida H. Saito H. Ohno R. Naoe T. Leukemia. 1997; 11: 1950-1956Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The resulting PML-RARα fusion of NB4/RA protein no longer retains ATRA-binding capacity. In the present study, we found the ATRA-dependent elevation of ASMase activity in NB4 accompanied by an increase in intracellular ceramide. Analyses of the 5′-promoter region of the ASMasegene revealed the presence of functional ATRA responsive motifs and AP2-like sequence. Although one of the important roles of ATRA is well known to be the induction o"
https://openalex.org/W2056332226,"DREAM, an EF-hand protein, associates with and modulates the activity of presenilins and Kv4 potassium channels in neural and cardiac tissues and represses prodynorphin and c-fos gene expression by binding to DNA response elements in these genes. Information concerning the metal-binding properties of DREAM and the consequences of metal binding on protein structure are important in understanding how this protein functions in cells. We now show that DREAM binds 1 mol of calcium/mol of protein with relatively high affinity and another 3 mol of calcium with lower affinity. DREAM binds 1 mol of magnesium/mol of protein. DREAM, pre-loaded with 1 mol of calcium, binds 1 mol of magnesium, thus demonstrating that the magnesium-binding site is distinct from the high affinity calcium-binding site. Analysis of metal binding to mutant DREAM protein constructs localizes the high affinity calcium-binding site and the magnesium-binding site to EF-hands 3 or 4. Binding of calcium but not magnesium changes the conformation, stability, and α-helical content of DREAM. Calcium, but not magnesium, reduces the affinity of apo-DREAM for specific DNA response elements in the prodynorphin and c-fos genes. We conclude that DREAM binds calcium and magnesium and that calcium, but not magnesium, modulates DREAM structure and function.

DREAM (downstream regulatoryelement antagonist modulator, also known as calsenilin or KChIP3) is an EF-hand protein, which binds to the carboxyl-terminal portion of presenilin 2 and the amino-terminal portion of Kv4 potassium channels and thereby modulates the activities of these proteins (1.Carrión A.M.

DREAM also is a member of a family of proteins that interact with the amino terminus of calcium-activated Kv4 potassium channels (8.An W.F. Bowlby M.R. Betty M. Cao J. Ling H.P. Mendoza G. Hinson J.W. Mattsson K.I. Strassle B.W. Trimmer J.S. Rhodes K.J. Nature. 2000; 403: 553-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (832) Google Scholar). These channels form fast-inactivating outward currents in neurons and transient outward currents in the heart, which are critical for normal function in these cells. In its metal-free form (henceforth referred to as the apo-form), DREAM acts as a direct transcriptional repressor of the prodynorphin and c-fos genes (1.Carrión A.M. Link W.A. Ledo F. Mellström B. Naranjo J.R. Nature. 1999; 398: 80-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar, 25.Mellström B. Naranjo J.R. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2001; 11: 312-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). In the presence of calcium, DREAM dissociates from the DNA response element, thus allowing the activity of these genes to increase (1.Carrión A.M. Link W.A. Ledo F. Mellström B. Naranjo J.R. Nature. 1999; 398: 80-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar). Caffeine, via calcium-dependent signaling pathways, relieves DREAM-mediated repression of the prodynorphin and c-fos for promoters in cells maintained in culture (1.Carrión A.M. Link W.A. Ledo F. Mellström B. Naranjo J.R. Nature. 1999; 398: 80-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar). presenilin dithiothreitol matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-mass spectrometry membrane preconcentration-capillary liquid chromatography microelectrospray ionization mass spectrometry 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid short full-length presenilin dithiothreitol matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-mass spectrometry membrane preconcentration-capillary liquid chromatography microelectrospray ionization mass spectrometry 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid short full-length DREAM has four EF-hand motifs with unknown metal-binding properties. It is not known if the protein binds calcium in all four EF-hands or whether it binds metals other than calcium. Mandel and Goodman (5.Mandel G. Goodman R.H. Nature. 1999; 398: 29-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) have suggested that the presence of an aspartate residue instead of a glutamate residue at the −Z position of the second EF-hand might allow the protein to bind magnesium. Knowledge of the metal-binding properties of DREAM and how such binding affects DREAM structure and function might be important to our understanding of the pathogenesis of some forms of Alzheimer's disease and in understanding of the modulation of potassium channel function in neural and cardiac tissues. We show for the first time that both calcium and magnesium are bound by DREAM at different sites and that the binding of calcium, but not magnesium, to the protein is associated with distinct structural changes in the protein that affect the affinity of the protein for DNA. Protein amino acid composition, protein amino-terminal and carboxyl-terminal sequencing, and DNA sequencing were carried out as described (26.Bidlingmeyer B.A. Cohen S.A. Tarvin T.L. J.

Soc. 1981; 103: 3185-3191Crossref Scopus (794) Google Scholar) was performed using an Applied Biosystems DNA/oligonucleotide synthesizer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). UV spectra of proteins and nucleic acids were recorded using a model DU-70 or DU-640 Beckman spectrophotometer (Beckman Instruments, Fullerton, CA). Protein concentrations were determined by amino acid analysis, by the Bradford method (30.Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (211983) Google Scholar), or by measuring UV absorbance using the molar absorptivity of DREAM at 281 nm of 29.6 ± 0.3 mm−1cm−1 obtained by quantitative determination of nitrogen by the indophenol blue method (31.Jaenicke L. Anal. Biochem. 1974; 61: 623-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Spectra were corrected for turbidity. SDS and non-denaturing PAGE was carried out using a PhastGel apparatus (Amersham Biosciences) and pre-cast gels. We synthesized the following DREAM proteins by methods detailed below for the full-length DREAM protein. The DREAM protein constructs prepared are as follows: full-length DREAM (amino acid residues 1–256, see Fig. 1, A and B); short full-length or sFL DREAM (amino acid residues 95–256, lacking the first 94 residues of the full-length protein); Δ1 DREAM (amino acid residues 114–256, lacking EF-hand 1); Δ4 DREAM (amino acid residues, 95–196, lacking EF-hand 4); Δ1,2 DREAM (amino acid residues 154–256, lacking EF-hands 1 and 2); Δ3,4 DREAM (amino acid residues 95–173, lacking EF-hands 3 and 4); and Δ1–4 (amino acid residues 1–101, lacking all 4 EF-hands). Full-length DREAM and mutant DREAM proteins were biosynthesized in Escherichia coli BL21 cells, transformed with pGEX-6P-1 plasmid (Amersham Biosciences) containing the DREAM complementary DNA sequence (GenBankTM accession number AJ131730) using procedures described previously (32.Craig T.A.

The primers shown in Scheme I were used to reverse-transcribe and amplify DREAM mRNA from human brain total RNA (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA) using the Titan One Tube Reverse Transcriptase-PCR System (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) by PCR methods (35.Innis M.A. Gelfand D.H.

The underlinedsequences in the forward and reverse primer (shown in Scheme FS1) represent BglII site and XhoI sites, respectively. The cDNA product was purified and ligated into the TA-cloning site of pCR 2.1 (Invitrogen); the chimeric DREAM pCR 2.1 plasmid was amplified in TOP 10 E. coli cells. The full-length DREAM cDNA served as the template for amplification of appropriate cDNAs for mutant forms of DREAM. The forward and reverse oligonucleotide primers (the underlined sequences in the forward and reverse primer represents BglII sites and XhoI sites, respectively) used in each case are shown in Table I.Table IForward and reverse oligonucleotide primers Open table in a new tab BglII and XhoI enzymes were used to excise the insert DREAM cDNA from DREAM pCR 2.1. The purified insert was ligated into BamHI- and XhoI-treated plasmid pGEX-6P-1. Chimeric DREAM pGEX-6P-1 plasmid was used to transform E. coli BL21 cells. Transformed cells were grown in 2× YT medium at 37 °C to an A600 of 1.0 absorbance units. Protein expression was induced with 1.0 mm isopropylthiogalactoside at 20 °C. After 7 h the cells were collected by centrifugation at 2,000 × g and lysed using 0.1-mm glass beads and a Bead Beater (Biospec Products, Bartlesville, OK). The clarified lysate was applied to a column of glutathione-Sepharose resin (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA). The fusion GST-DREAM protein was eluted in glutathione elution buffer containing 1.5 mm EDTA (30.Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (211983) Google Scholar) and treated with PreScission protease (Amersham Biosciences) at 4 °C. The protease-treated protein was concentrated, dialyzed against Mono-Q start buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 1.5 mm EDTA, 10 mm dithiothreitol (DTT)), and purified by chromatography on a Mono-Q HR10/10 column (Amersham Biosciences). A NaCl gradient (0–1 m in Mono-Q start buffer) was developed over 1 h. Fractions containing DREAM were pooled and dialyzed against buffer (50 mm Tris, 5 mm DTT, 1.5 mm EDTA, pH 7.5). For the Δ3,4 DREAM construct and the 1–101 DREAM construct on-column PreScission Protease treatment was carried out, and pure proteins obtained in this manner were used for analysis. DREAM protein sequence was verified by tryptic digestion of the intact protein, followed by mapping of the resulting tryptic peptides by MALDI-MS. MALDI-MS data was obtained on a Voyager DE-STR system (PE Biosystems, Framingham, MA) using the reflector mode over mass range 400–4,500 Da with 20-kV accelerating voltage. Sequence information was obtained from the identified peptides using on-line mPC-LC-MS/MS performed with a Micromass Q-Tof II mass spectrometer (Micromass, Danvers, MA) equipped with a modified Micromass nano-ESI interface (37.Yang Q. Tomlinson A.J. Naylor S. Anal. Chem. 1999; 71: 183-189Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Membrane PC-LC-MS spectra were recorded over mass range 300–1900 every 2 s. Mass resolution was 8000–10,000. The mass axis was calibrated over the range of 172.88 to 1821.72 with NaI. Precursor ions were automatically chosen from MS survey scans over mass range 375–1500. Collision energy values were automatically chosen as a function of precursor ion charge state and m/z value. Argon was used as the collision gas, at collision energies varying from 15 to 50 eV. μESI-MS analyses were carried out on a Finnigan MAT 900 double focusing mass spectrometer (MAT, Bremen, Germany) of E (electrostatic analyzer)-B (magnet) geometry. Analyses of DREAM and the metal ion titration experiments were performed in positive ion mode, using a modified μESI source introduction interface described previously (38.Johnson K.L. Veenstra T.D. Tomlinson A.J. Kumar R. Naylor S. Rapid Commun. Mass Spectrom. 1997; 11: 939-942Crossref Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Measurements were carried out in the presence of SF6. The mass spectra were scanned from mass to charge (m/z) 1000–6000, at a scan speed of 10 s per decade and instrument resolution of 2000. Ions were detected at the position and time resolved ion counter (PATRIC), using a channel plate voltage of 850 V, and raw data were transformed using Finnigan MAT software. Working solutions of 10 or 24 μm of DREAM were prepared in ∼25 μm EDTA, pH 7.8. Metal ion titration experiments were carried out by incubating DREAM with appropriate concentrations of metal salts for 30 min. Samples were analyzed directly or put through a cation ion exchange cartridge (Opti-Guard Guard Column, SIS, Inc., Ringoes, NY) prior to MS analysis. Fluorescence measurements of apo-DREAM (5–10 μm) were performed in 60 mm MOPS, 2 mm EGTA, 0.5 mm DTT, pH 7.0, buffer before and after the addition of CaCl2 or MgCl2. The entire corrected fluorescence emission spectrum from 300 to 450 nm was measured using a SPEX 1680 spectrofluorimeter (SPEX, Edison, NJ). Final values were corrected for dilution and normalized. CD spectra of DREAM (10–20 μm) in 60 mmMOPS, 2 mm EGTA, 0.5 mm DTT, pH 7.0, were collected on a J-715 spectropolarimeter (JASCO, Japan). Spectral and temperature-dependent measurements were performed at a bandwidth of 2 nm using a U-type quartz cell of path length 0.233 mm (for far-UV measurements, 188–250 nm) and with a rectangular 1-cm cell (for near-UV measurements, 245–320 nm) in a thermostated cell holder. CD spectra were recorded at 10 °C using 5 accumulations, each at scan speed of 20 nm/min and response time of 2 s. The continuous temperature dependence of ellipticity at 222 nm was measured using a scan rate of 50 °C/h and a response time of 8 s. Solvent evaporation was prevented by placing a drop of oil on the sample in the cell. CD spectra were smoothed using a Jasco noise reduction routine. CD data are presented in units of molar ellipticity per residue. Secondary structure determinations were carried out as described (39.Sreerama N. Woody R.W. Anal.

Electrophoretic mobility shift assays were carried out using DREAM apoprotein and oligonucleotides containing response elements for DREAM: prodynorphin oligonucleotide, 5′ GAAGCCGGAGTCAAGGAGGCCCCTG 3′; mutant prodynorphin oligonucleotide, 5′ GAAGCCGTAACGCTTAAGGCCCCTG 3′; c-fos oligonucleotide, 5′ CTGCAGCGAGCAACTGAGAATCCAAGAC 3′; mutant c-fosoligonucleotide, 5′ CTGCAGCGAGCAACAAAGAATCCAAGAC 3′. Double-stranded DNAs were prepared by annealing complementary DNA strands to the above noted oligonucleotides. Interaction of DREAM protein with DNA was carried out in 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 0.5 mm DTT, 0.15 μg/ml poly(dI-dC)·poly(dI-dC), 50 μm EDTA, 10% glycerol with appropriate amounts of Ca2+ acetate or Mg2+ acetate. In some instances, buffer containing 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.8, 10% glycerol, 0.1 mm EDTA, 8 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT, 0.15 μg/ml poly(dI-dC)·poly(dI-dC) was used. Supershift analysis was carried out by adding a specific anti-DREAM antibody raised in rabbits against biosynthetic full-length DREAM (Cocalico Biologicals, Reamstown, PA). The Kd values for calcium in DREAM were determined by adding increasing amounts of 45Ca to 100 pmol of purified DREAM in 1 ml of 0.1 m Tris, pH 7.5, and incubating the reaction mixture for 90 min at 37 °C. 100 μl of anti-DREAM polyclonal antibody (1:50 dilution) were added to the mixture, and the reaction was allowed to proceed overnight at 4 °C. 100 μl of a 10% suspension of IgSorb protein A in 0.1 mTris, pH 7.5 (Enzyme Center, Bedford, MA), was added to each tube, and the mixture was vortexed. After 2 min the tubes were centrifuged at 1,000 × g, and radioactivity in the pellet was determined by scintillation spectrometry. Nonspecific binding of 45Ca to DREAM was determined by measurement of binding in the presence of 0.1 m CaCl2. The Kd values for the protein were determined using established methods for fitting equilibrium binding data (47.Knott G. A Mathematical Modeling Laboratory, MLAB Applications Manual. Civilized Software, Inc., Bethesda1996: 48-75Google Scholar). Microliter additions of full-length DREAM (970 μm) in 0.5 mm DTT were combined with EDTA (sodium salt, 0.5m, pH 8.0 stock) and 100 mm Tris, pH 7.6, with or without either or both calcium acetate and magnesium acetate to give ∼1:1 or ∼8:1 metal/protein ratios. The final concentrations are as follows: 200 μm DREAM, 60 mm Tris, 80 μm EDTA. Bovine serum albumin was run in one lane of gel. Amino acid composition and amino-terminal and carboxyl-terminal sequencing afforded data consistent with the predicted sequences of all constructs (Fig. 1, A and B). Analysis of full-length DREAM by μESI-MS afforded a multiply charged ion series, which on transformation revealed a relative molecular mass of 29,643 Da (expected 29,641 Da, Fig. 2A and Table II). This experimental value is well within the 0.01% accuracy for such measurements. Tryptic peptides derived from DREAM were analyzed directly by MALDI-MS. A tryptic peptide map was obtained covering ∼75% of the expected protein sequence. The tryptic peptide mixture was analyzed by mPC-LC-MS/MS, and a total of eight peptides were subjected to collision-induced dissociation, and the resulting product ion spectra were submitted to the Sequest program (48.Link A.J.

All eight peptides were identified as being derived from human DREAM protein. One of these peptides (MH+ = 985.5) had the sequence GPLGSMQPAK, identifying it as the amino terminus of the protein. The first five amino acids are derived from the PreScission Protease cleavage site and the linker region. Thus, the biosynthetic protein was unambiguously characterized as human DREAM. Subsequently, all mutant DREAM proteins were subjected to μESI-MS.

Furthermore, using this approach, it is possible to determine exact stoichiometries of metal ion binding to the protein, because uptake of specific metal ions does not significantly alter protein ionization efficiencies (49.Veenstra T.D.

To investigate the metal-binding properties of DREAM, we analyzed both apo-DREAM and metal ion-titrated DREAM solutions in positive ion μESI-MS. In all cases, we carried out systematic titration studies adding to ∼25 μm DREAM, containing 25 μm EDTA, metal ions to concentrations of 10, 20, 50, 100, 125, 150, 175, 200, 300, and 500 μm. As noted above, mass spectral analysis of apo-DREAM revealed a mass of 29,643 Da (Fig. 2A). This corresponds to monomeric DREAM; there was no detectable evidence for the presence of dimeric or other multimeric forms of the protein. However, as increasing amounts of calcium are added to the protein solution, a significant change in the μESI spectrum is noted. For example, addition of calcium to 125 μm results in the uptake of 4 eq of Ca2+ ions/mol of DREAM (Fig. 2B). Uptake of 1 Ca2+ ion (peak ion abundance 100%) and 2 Ca2+ ions (peak ion abundance ∼80%) are the predominant ion species. However, there is also clear evidence for uptake of an additional 3 Ca2+ ions (∼60% peak ion abundance) and 4 Ca2+ ions (∼30% peak ion abundance) (Fig. 2B), indicating that all four EF-hands bind Ca2+ ions. When the amount of calcium added to apo-DREAM reaches or exceeds 175 μm, additional binding of small amounts of calcium occur, up to 6 mol eq/mol of protein. This observation was highly reproducible, but increasing the μESI source voltages that affect skimmer collision-induced dissociation results in facile loss of these additional Ca2+ ions, indicating that they were nonspecifically bound metal ion-protein adducts (51.Veenstra T.D.

After heterologous overexpression, all three gene products have been characterized and shown to be Rieske proteins as typified by sequence analysis and EPR spectroscopy. Two of the overproduced proteins contained already incorporated iron-sulfur clusters, whereas the third one formed unstable aggregates, in which the FeS cluster had to be reconstituted after refolding of the denatured protein. Although EPR spectroscopy showed typical FeS signals for all Rieske proteins, an unusual low midpoint potential was revealed for PetC3 by EPR redox titration. Detailed characterization of Synechocystismembranes indicated that all three Rieske proteins are expressed under physiological conditions. Both for PetC1 and PetC3 the association with the thylakoid membrane was shown, and both could be identified, although in different amounts, in the isolated cytochrome b6 f complex. The considerably lower redox potential determined for PetC3 indicates heterogeneous cytochrome b6 f complexes in Synechocystis and suggests still to be established alternative electron transport routes."
https://openalex.org/W2090329708,"Nicotinamide/nicotinate mononucleotide (NMN/ NaMN)adenylyltransferase (NMNAT) is an indispensable enzyme in the biosynthesis of NAD+ and NADP+. Human NMNAT displays unique dual substrate specificity toward both NMN and NaMN, thus flexible in participating in both de novo and salvage pathways of NAD synthesis. Human NMNAT also catalyzes the rate-limiting step of the metabolic conversion of the anticancer agent tiazofurin to its active form tiazofurin adenine dinucleotide (TAD). The tiazofurin resistance is mainly associated with the low NMNAT activity in the cell. We have solved the crystal structures of human NMNAT in complex with NAD, deamido-NAD, and a non-hydrolyzable TAD analogue β-CH2-TAD. These complex structures delineate the broad substrate specificity of the enzyme toward both NMN and NaMN and reveal the structural mechanism for adenylation of tiazofurin nucleotide. The crystal structure of human NMNAT also shows that it forms a barrel-like hexamer with the predicted nuclear localization signal sequence located on the outside surface of the barrel, supporting its functional role of interacting with the nuclear transporting proteins. The results from the analytical ultracentrifugation studies are consistent with the formation of a hexamer in solution under certain conditions."

The signaling mechanisms, which may determine cytokine specificity and redundancy, are not well understood. IRS proteins are tyrosine-phosphorylated following IL-9 and IL-4 stimulation, a process in part mediated by JAK tyrosine kinases (Yin, T. G., Keller, S. R., Quelle, F. W., Witthuhn, B. A., Tsang, M.

In the present study, we used 32D cells stably transfected with insulin receptor (32DIR), which do not express any IRS proteins, as a model system to study the requirement of different structural domains of IRS proteins in IL-9- and IL-4-mediated functions. Overexpression of IRS-1 and IRS-2, but not IRS-4, induced proliferation of 32DIR cells in response to IL-9. The pleckstrin homology (PH) domain of IRS proteins is required for IRS-mediated proliferation stimulated by IL-9. The phosphotyrosine binding and Shc and IRS-1 NPXY binding domains are interchangeable for IRS to transduce the proliferative effect of IL-4. Therefore, the PH domain plays different roles in coupling IRS proteins to activated IL-9 and IL-4 receptors. The role of IRS proteins in determining cytokine specificity was corroborated by their ability to interact with different downstream signaling molecules.

Upon ligand binding, IL-9- and IL-4-specific receptor α chains heterodimerize with the IL-2Rγ chain, leading to the activation of Jak1 and Jak3. Despite activating the same Janus kinases, IL-9 and IL-4 elicit common and distinct signaling pathways in hematopoietic cells. Both cytokines stimulate phosphorylation of signal transducers and activators of transcription (STATs) and insulin receptor substrate (IRS) proteins (14Yin T.G. Tsang M.L. Yang Y.C. J. Biol.

IL-9 and IL-4 activate STAT3 and STAT6, respectively, which may in part be responsible for the expression of different primary response genes. IRS proteins (IRS-1 through -4) with a highly conserved N terminus and divergent C terminus are involved in many physiological functions, such as cell growth, insulin response and reproduction in vivo (16Withers D.J.

The N terminus, consisting of pleckstrin homology (PH), phosphotyrosine binding (PTB), and Shc and IRS-1 NPXY binding (SAIN) domains, has been proposed to couple IRS proteins to activated receptors and mediate subsequent tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS proteins. After tyrosine phosphorylation at the C terminus, which contains about twenty potential tyrosine phosphorylation sites, IRS proteins interact with SH2-containing signaling proteins, such as the p85 regulatory subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3′-kinase (PI3K), Grb-2, Shp-2, Nck, and PLCγ. The PH domain is present in over 120 proteins, including serine/threonine kinases, tyrosine kinases, phospholipases and cytoskeletal proteins (18Musacchio A. Gibson T. Rice P. Thompson J. Saraste M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1993; 18: 343-348Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar). The PTB domain was originally identified in Shc as a phosphotyrosine-binding motif (NPXY binding motif) different from the SH2 domain and has been characterized in many molecules, including IRS proteins (19Kavanaugh W.M.

Cell. 1994; 76: 811-820Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). Although primary sequences do not reveal any homology, PH and PTB domains have similar three-dimensional structures, consisting of seven anti-parallel β-sheets, a C-terminal α-helix, plus an α-helix in one of the surface loops (21Ferguson K.M. Lemmon M.A. Schlessinger J. Sigler P. Cell. 1994; 79: 199-209Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). They are electrostatically polarized and contain a pocket capable of binding to the ligand. The SAIN domain (amino acids 313–462) was identified as the minimum region essential for IRS-1 interaction with the insulin receptor (IR) in yeast two-hybrid studies, and this region shows a high degree of similarity with the Shc PTB domain (amino acids 42–200) (22Craparo A.

Overexpression of the SAIN domain of IRS-1 abrogates tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1 and Shc following stimulation by insulin (24Sharma P.M. Egawa K. Gustafson T.A. Martin J.L. Olefsky J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 7386-7397Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), probably through competitive binding to the juxtamembrane region of IR, indicating a role for the SAIN domain in mediating IRS-1 interaction with IR. The PH domain is often involved in the attachment of proteins to membranes, either by direct binding to phospholipids and/or by protein-protein interactions. Interaction of PH domain with the kinase domain of Bruton's tyrosine kinase regulates its kinase activity (25Saito K. Scharenberg A.M. Kinet J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 16201-16206Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). The PH domain of IRS proteins binds to phospholipids and proteins, whereas the PTB domain binds to NPXY motifs in the IR and insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor (26Farooq A. Plotnikova O. Zeng L. Zhou M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6114-6121Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Besides growth factors like insulin and insulin-like growth factor-1, IRS proteins are tyrosine-phosphorylated following stimulation of cells by cytokines, such as IL-2, IL-4, IL-9, interferons, oncostatin M, and leukemia inhibitory factor (27Johnston J.A. Wang L.M. Hanson E.P. Sun X.J. White M.F. Oakes S.A. Pierce J.H. O'Shea J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28527-28530Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 28Burfoot M.S.

Among these cytokine receptors, only the IL-4 receptor α chain contains NPXY motifs. To elucidate the mechanisms by which IRS proteins integrate into different cytokine signaling, we used IL-4 and IL-9 as models to explore the functional roles of IRS N-terminal domains in coupling IRS proteins to cytokine receptors with and without NPXY. Through examining the tyrosine phosphorylation and growth-promoting ability of N-terminal deletion mutants of IRS-1/2 in IL-9- and IL-4-stimulated cells, we found that the PH domain is essential for the activation of IRS signaling induced by IL-9, but not IL-4. These results suggest the important role of the PH domain in mediating IRS coupling to non-NPXY motif-containing cytokine receptors. In addition, tyrosine-phosphorylated IRS proteins in IL-4- and IL-9-stimulated cells recruited different SH2-containing molecules, further suggesting IRS-mediated signaling specificity between these two cytokines.

IRS-1ΔSAIN was constructed byXbaI digestion of pcDNA3 containing the full-length of IRS-1 cDNA to remove amino acids 248–582 that is required for the functions of the SAIN domain (31Zhou M.M.

The remaining IRS-1 was religated in-frame to pcDNA3. IRS-1Δ(SAIN+PH+PTB) was generated by BamHI and EcoRV digestion to delete amino acids 1–859 that contain the PH, PTB, and SAIN domains. TheBamHI-EcoRV fragment (amino acids 860–1231) was subcloned into pcDNA-FLAG at the BglII andEcoRV sites. All plasmid constructs were confirmed by DNA sequencing and protein expression in COS-1 cells and TS1 T lymphocytes. IRS-1 constructs used to generate 32DIR transfectants have been described previously (32Yenush L. Makati K.J. Smith-Hall J. Ishibashi O. Myers Jr M.G. White M.F. J. Biol.

For IRS-1/2 transfectants, 5 mm histidinol was included in the medium. TS1 cells were maintained in Click's medium (Irvine Scientific, Santa Ana, CA) supplemented with murine IL-9 (0.1 ng/ml). Electroporation was performed to transfect IRS-1 mutants into TS1 cells as described previously (33Zhu Y.X. Sun H.B. Tsang M.L. McMahel J. Grigsby S. Yin T.G. Yang Y.C. J. Biol.

Briefly, 10 μg of IRS-1 mutant constructs was transfected into TS1 cells by a single 250-V/960-microfarad (μF) pulse in a Bio-Rad Gene Pulser. After selection in G418 (0.6 mg/ml) for 10–14 days, resistant cells were further cloned by limiting dilution. The dominant negative Akt mutant (34Kohn A.D. Takeuchi F. Roth R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21920-21926Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar) was cotransfected with pBabe-puro (35Morgenstern J.P. Land H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 3587-3596Crossref PubMed Scopus (1886) Google Scholar) (DNA ratio 10:1) into 32DIR/IRS-1 cells by a single 250-V/500-μF pulse. Following transfection, cells were plated into 96-well plates and selected with 1.5 μg/ml of puromycin for 10 days. For each construct, at least 24 clones were picked and analyzed for expression of IRS-1 or dominant negative Akt by immunoblotting. Three independent clones from each of the constructs were used for further experiments. 32DIR cells were starved in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium medium without serum and WEHI-conditioned medium for 4 h, while TS1 cells were starved in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium without serum and IL-9 for 7 h. Following starvation, cells (2 × 107/ml) were stimulated with IL-9 and IL-4 (100 ng/ml) at 37 °C for 5 min. Cells were collected by centrifugation and lysed in 1 ml of TNE lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 5% glycerol, 5 mm EDTA, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 2 mm sodium vanadate) containing 1% Nonidet P-40 for immunoprecipitation or 0.5% Nonidet P-40 for coimmunoprecipitation. Solubilized proteins were collected for immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting. Immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting were performed as described previously (36Yin T.G. Keller S.R. Quelle F.W.

IL-9- and IL-4-stimulated [3H]thymidine incorporation in 32DIR cell lines was assayed as described previously (33Zhu Y.X. Sun H.B. Tsang M.L. McMahel J. Grigsby S. Yin T.G. Yang Y.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21334-21340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Briefly, 32DIR cells were washed and seeded into 96-well plates at 2 × 105/ml in RPMI with 10% fetal bovine serum alone or containing various concentrations of IL-9 and IL-4, or 5% IL-3 containing WEHI-conditioned medium, followed by incubation at 37 °C for 48 h. [3H]Thymidine (Amersham Biosciences, Inc., specific activity 5 Ci/mmol) was added at a concentration of 2 μCi/ml for the final 4 h. Cells were collected onto glass microfiber filters and counted in scintillation fluid using a liquid scintillation counter (Beckman Instruments, LS6000IC). We have previously shown that IRS-1 and IRS-2 are tyrosine-phosphorylated by Janus kinases following IL-9 and IL-4 stimulation (33Zhu Y.X. Sun H.B. Tsang M.L. McMahel J. Grigsby S. Yin T.G. Yang Y.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21334-21340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 36Yin T.G. Keller S.R. Quelle F.W. Witthuhn B.A. Tsang M.L. Lienhard G.E. Ihle J.N. Yang Y.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20497-20502Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The mechanisms involved in tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS proteins by Janus kinases and other receptor tyrosine kinases are unclear. The NPXY (Tyr-497) motif within the human IL-4 receptor is critical for the activation of the IRS pathway (20Keegan A.D. Neims K. White M.F. Wang L.M. Pierce J.H. Paul W.E. Cell. 1994; 76: 811-820Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). We found that Box1 and a downstream region (amino acids 338–422) within the human IL-9 receptor, which do not contain NPXY motifs, are necessary for IRS-2 tyrosine phosphorylation (33Zhu Y.X. Sun H.B. Tsang M.L. McMahel J. Grigsby S. Yin T.G. Yang Y.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21334-21340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). It is possible that IL-9 and IL-4 receptors may use different mechanisms to recruit IRS proteins following ligand binding. To explore such mechanisms, we examined the functional roles of the structural domains of IRS-1 in TS1 cells following stimulation with IL-4 or IL-9. A series of N-terminal deletion mutants of IRS-1 (Fig.1 A) were stably transfected into TS1 cells. The expression levels of these IRS-1 mutants were relatively equal as determined by Western blot analysis (Fig.1 B). We analyzed different domains in coupling IRS-1 to activated receptors by examining the tyrosine phosphorylation of these deletion mutants after cytokine stimulation. As shown in Fig.1 C, following IL-9 stimulation, wild type IRS-1 and the IRS-1ΔSAIN deletion mutant were tyrosine-phosphorylated, suggesting that the SAIN domain is not necessary for IL-9-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1. However, the IRS-1ΔPHmutant lacking half of the PH domain was not tyrosine-phosphorylated, indicating that the PH domain is required for IL-9-induced tyrosine phosphorylation. IRS-1Δ(PH+PTB) and IRS-1Δ(PH+PTB+SAIN) mutants, which lack PH domain, were not tyrosine-phosphorylated, further demonstrating the essential role of the PH domain in IL-9-induced IRS-1 tyrosine phosphorylation. In contrast, IL-4 was able to stimulate tyrosine phosphorylation of all of the IRS-1 deletion mutants tested except IRS-1Δ(PH+PTB+SAIN), suggesting that the PH, PTB, or SAIN domains are sufficient to mediate IRS-1 tyrosine phosphorylation induced by IL-4. These data demonstrate that the PH domain plays different roles in coupling IRS-1 to IL-9 and IL-4 receptors. We have previously shown that overexpression of IRS-1 in TS1 cells, which express IRS-2 constitutively, enhanced the sensitivity of TS1 cells to IL-9 (36Yin T.G. Keller S.R. Quelle F.W. Witthuhn B.A. Tsang M.L. Lienhard G.E. Ihle J.N. Yang Y.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20497-20502Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), suggesting a possible role for IRS proteins in IL-9-mediated proliferation. In this study, we used myeloid progenitor 32D cells, which do not express any IRS proteins, as a model system to explore the functions of IRS proteins and the roles of N-terminal domains in mediating the proliferative effects of IL-9 and IL-4. We transfected 32DIR cells with wild type and deletion mutants of IRS-1/2 (Fig. 2 A(32Yenush L. Makati K.J. Smith-Hall J. Ishibashi O. Myers Jr M.G. White M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24300-24306Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar)). 32DIR cells transfected with these mutants expressed comparable levels of the IRS proteins (32Yenush L. Makati K.J. Smith-Hall J. Ishibashi O. Myers Jr M.G. White M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24300-24306Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). As in TS1 cells, deletion of the PH domain, but not the PTB domain, abrogated tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1 induced by IL-9 but not IL-4 (Fig.2 B). These consistent data, based on results using two independent PH deletion mutants characterized in two different cell lines, suggest that the PH domain is necessary for coupling IRS-1 to activated IL-9 but not IL-4 receptor. Despite high homology between IRS-1 and IRS-2, different mechanisms are involved in the binding of IRS-1/2 to the insulin receptor. Although IRS-1 binds to the phosphorylated NPXY (Tyr-960) motif of the insulin receptor juxtamembrane region, mainly through the PTB domain (23Gustafson T.A. He W. Craparo A. Schaub C.D. O'Neill T.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2500-2508Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar), IRS-2 can also bind to insulin receptor through the 591–786 region, which is absent in IRS-1 (38Sawka-Verhelle D. Tartare-Deckert S. White M.F. van Obberghen E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5980-5983Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). To test whether the functions of the PH, PTB, and SAIN domains of IRS-2 are different from those of IRS-1 in IL-9 and IL-4 signaling, we examined tyrosine phosphorylation of wild type and serial deletion mutants of IRS-2 in 32DIR cells following immunoprecipitation with anti-IRS-2. As shown in Fig. 2 C, 32DIR cell lines overexpressing IRS-2 deletion mutants yielded results similar to those obtained with IRS-1. This suggests that similar mechanisms are utilized to couple IRS-1 and IRS-2 to activated IL-9 and IL-4 receptors. To determine the physiological effects of IRS-1/2 deletion mutants, we measured the proliferation of 32DIR cell lines by [3H]thymidine incorporation. First, we investigated the ability of wild type IRS proteins to mediate the proliferative effects of IL-9 and IL-4 in 32DIR cells. As shown in Fig.3 A, IRS-1/2 enhanced IL-9- and IL-4-induced 32DIR cell proliferation. IRS-4 only promoted cell proliferation induced by IL-4, but not IL-9, suggesting that IRS-4 plays different roles in IL-9 and IL-4 signaling. Further studies on IRS-1/2 deletion mutants demonstrated that growth promotion mediated by IRS-1/2 mutants correlates with their tyrosine phosphorylation status in 32DIR cells (Fig. 3 B). The mechanisms involved in IRS-1/2 tyrosine phosphorylation may vary depending on cytokines studied. We hypothesized that these differences affect the ability of phosphorylated IRS proteins to interact with downstream signaling molecules. To test this possibility, we examined interaction of PI3K, Grb-2, and Shp-2 with IRS proteins activated by IL-4 and IL-9. As shown in Fig.4, in TS1/IRS-1 and 32DIR/IRS-1/2 cells, tyrosine-phosphorylated IRS-1 stimulated by IL-9 and IL-4 recruited the p85 regulatory subunit of PI3K and Grb-2. We detected Shp-2 binding to IRS-1 in TS1/IRS-1 cells following stimulation by IL-4 but not IL-9. Although Shp-2 association with IRS-1/2 was not detectable in 32DIR/IRS-1/2 cells following stimulation with IL-9 or IL-4 (Fig. 4), Shp-2 tyrosine phosphorylation was IRS-1/2-dependent and only induced by IL-4 but not IL-9 (Fig. 5).Figure 5Tyrosine phosphorylation of Shp-2 stimulated by IL-9 and IL-4 in different 32DIR cell lines. 4 × 107 cells were starved for 4 h prior to stimulation for 10 min by IL-9 or IL-4. Cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with 5 μl of anti-Shp-2. Protein samples were separated by 10% SDS-PAGE and transferred onto a PVDF membrane. The membrane was probed with anti-phosphotyrosine, anti-Shp-2, and anti-IRS-1, respectively. The same results were obtained from three independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To explore the role of PI3K in IRS protein-mediated cell proliferation, we examined whether PI3K inhibitors, wortmannin and LY294002, could inhibit proliferation stimulated by IL-9 and IL-4 in TS1/IRS-1 and 32DIR/IRS-1 cells. As shown in Fig.6 A, wortmannin and LY294002 inhibited cell proliferation induced by IL-9 and IL-4, suggesting that PI3K plays an essential role in IRS-1-mediated cell proliferation stimulated by both cytokines. Although PI3K could be recruited to IRS, the downstream signaling events mediated by PI3K might be different following IL-9 and IL-4 stimulation. Previous studies have shown that the Akt threonine/serine kinase is a downstream target for activated PI3K. Thus we tested whether Akt can be activated by IL-9. As shown in Fig. 6 B, although Akt was phosphorylated at Thr-308 site in response to IL-4 stimulation in 32DIR/IRS-1 cells, we could not detect Akt phosphorylation after IL-9 stimulation. To further address whether Akt plays a specific role in IL-4- and IL-9-induced cell proliferation, we established 32DIR/IRS-1 cell lines that express dominant negative Akt. As shown in Fig.7 A, IL-4-induced cell proliferation was attenuated in three independent dominant negative Akt-expressing clones. Furthermore, the activation of p70 S6 kinase, which was inhibited in the presence of PI3K inhibitor, was reduced by the expression of dominant negative Akt in IL-4-stimulated cells (Fig.7 B), demonstrating that PI3K-dependent activation of Akt and p70 S6 kinase is important for IL-4 signaling. In contrast, dominant negative Akt did not attenuate IL-9-stimulated cell proliferation in 32DIR/IRS-1 cells (Fig. 7 A) and p70 S6 kinase activation was not detected in IL-9-stimulated 32DIR/IRS-1 cells (Fig. 7 B). IL-9 and IL-4 promote the growth of T lymphoma cells in vitro, but the mechanism by which the proliferative signals are transduced is not well understood. Activation of Jak/STAT and IRS-1 pathways has been shown to be important for IL-4- and IL-9-stimulated proliferation and anti-apoptosis in hematopoietic cells (39Demoulin J.B. Uyttenhove C.

In this study, we showed that IRS-1/2, but not IRS-4, enhances proliferation in response to IL-9. Thus IRS family members play different physiological functions in cytokine signaling. Many multimodular molecules engage signaling pathways through various structural domains or different interface of the same domain to interact with diverse proteins. Shc associates with the IR through the PTB domain binding to the NPXY motifs, but primarily uses an SH2 domain to interact with activated epidermal growth factor receptor (41Sasaoka T. Draznin B. Leitner J.W. Langlois W.J. Olefsky J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10734-10738Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In insulin signaling, both the PH and PTB domains of IRS-1, as well as the KRLP domain of IRS-2 are important in mediating insulin-induced IRS activation (38Sawka-Verhelle D. Tartare-Deckert S.

Previous studies demonstrated that the NPAY motif in the IL-4 receptor is required for IRS tyrosine phosphorylation stimulated by IL-4, and the PTB domain can directly bind to this motif in vitro, suggesting the important role for the PTB domain in IL-4 signaling (20Keegan A.D. Neims K. White M.F. Wang L.M. Pierce J.H. Paul W.E. Cell. 1994; 76: 811-820Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). In this study, we showed that none of the N-terminal domains is absolutely essential for the activation of the IRS pathway by IL-4, and the SAIN domain appears to be sufficient to couple IRS proteins to the IL-4 receptor. Considering the structural and functional similarities between the PTB and SAIN domains, we propose that the PTB and/or SAIN domains could be the major adaptors for coupling IRS proteins to cytokine receptors containing the NPXY or NPXY-like motifs. Our data also suggest that the PH domain, but not PTB or SAIN domains, is essential for coupling IRS proteins to IL-9 receptor. This PH domain-coupling model in IL-9 signaling may be widely employed by other cytokine receptors that do not contain the NPXY motifs, such as interferon, IL-2, and IL-7 receptors. The PH domain may interact with phospholipids or membrane proteins to localize IRS proteins to the plasma membrane to facilitate interactions with the IL-9 receptor or bind with the IL-9 receptor-associated proteins. Because the PH domain plays different roles in IL-9 and IL-4 signaling, the mechanisms involved in IRS activation could be due to specific interactions with IL-9 receptor-associated proteins. So far, many proteins have been shown to interact with the PH domain of IRS proteins, such as PHIP (PH domain-interacting protein), acidic proteins as well as 14-3-3 (44Farhang-Fallah J. Yin X.

Interestingly, 14-3-3 also interacts with integrin and cytokine receptors, raising the possibility that 14-3-3 may function as a bridge between the receptors and other signaling molecules (47Kimura M.T.

Blood. 1999; 94: 1933-1942Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, x-ray structure study provides evidence that 14-3-3 dimer forms two large acidic grooves that can associate with two different molecules. We have shown that 14-3-3 interacts with the IL-9 but not IL-4 receptor α chain (51Sliva D. Gu M.Y. Zhu Y.X. Chen J. Tsai S. Du X.P. Yang Y.C. Biochem. J. 2000; 345: 741-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), further suggesting that 14-3-3 may link IRS proteins to the IL-9 receptor. We also investigated the role of signaling molecules, such as PI3K, Grb-2, and Shp-2, in cell proliferation mediated by IL-9 and IL-4. By using PI3K inhibitors and dominant negative Akt, we have confirmed that the PI3K-Akt pathway is necessary for IRS protein-mediated cell proliferation in IL-4 signaling. Although PI3K activity is required for cell proliferation stimulated by IL-9 in 32D cells (Fig.6 A), we and others have failed to detect Akt activation in this cell line (52Demoulin J.P. Grasso L. Atkins J.M. Stevens M. Louahed J. Levitt R.C. Nicolaides N.C. Renauld J.C. FEBS Lett. 2000; 482: 200-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). In addition, p70 S6 kinase, one of the downstream substrates of PI3K, is not activated by IL-9 stimulation, indicating there might be other pathways activated by PI3K that mediate the proliferative effect of IL-9. Although Grb-2 can activate MAPK upon binding to IRS-1 following insulin stimulation, Grb-2/Sos binding to IRS-1 does not result in MAPK activation by IL-4 (37Pruett W. Yuan Y. Rose E. Batzer A.G. Harrada N. Skolnik E.Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1778-1785Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) or IL-9 (data not shown). Therefore, Grb-2 may bind other unknown proline-rich proteins through the SH3 domains to transduce IRS-dependent signals following IL-9 and IL-4 stimulation. Thus, PI3K, but not MAPK, is likely to be an important downstream signaling molecule in IRS-mediated cell proliferation in IL-9- and IL-4-stimulated cells. Divergent signaling pathways downstream of PI3K most likely further contribute to the signaling and functional specificity of these two cytokines. We also found that Shp-2, an SH2-containing tyrosine phosphatase, physically associates with tyrosine-phosphorylated IRS-1 induced by IL-4 but not by IL-9. Shp-2 recruited by IRS proteins may mediate downstream signaling in the IL-4-induced IRS signaling pathway. However, in the present study, we could not detect IRS protein-dependent MAPK activation in IL-4 signaling (data not shown), suggesting that other uncharacterized pathways may be activated by IRS/Shp-2 in IL-4 signaling. These data support the hypothesis that different tyrosine motifs within the C terminus of IRS proteins are phosphorylated to transduce specific functions of different stimuli. In summary, our attempts to explore the roles of different N-terminal domains in coupling IRS proteins to IL-9 and IL-4 receptors reveal that different structural domains are utilized to couple different cytokine receptors. The PTB and/or SAIN domains may anchor IRS proteins to receptors with the NPXY or NPXY-like motifs, whereas the PH domain is essential for IRS association with receptors without the NPXY motifs. Our data also demonstrate that the specific physiological functions of IL-9 and IL-4 might be mediated by IRS through the recruitment of different SH2-containing molecules. Furthermore, PI3K-dependent, but Akt/p70 S6 kinase-independent, pathways may play an important role in transducing the proliferative effect of IL-9. We thank Dr. Richard A. Roth for generously providing dominant negative Akt mutant and Dr. David Donner for reading the manuscript and helpful discussions."

Crystal structures of related NBDs suggest a structural model with an important signaling role for a γ-phosphate linker peptide that couples bound nucleotide to movement of an α-helical subdomain. We mutated two residues in CFTR that the structural model predicts will uncouple effects of nucleotide binding from movement of the α-helical subdomain.

In NBD1, Q493A reduced the frequency of channel opening, suggesting a role for this residue in coupling ATP binding to channel opening. In contrast, N505C increased the frequency of channel opening, consistent with a role for Asn-505 in stabilizing the inactive state of the NBD. In NBD2, Q1291A decreased the effects of pyrophosphate without altering other functions.

The conserved features of this family are two membrane-spanning domains and two cytoplasmic nucleotide-binding domains (NBD). CFTR also contains a unique regulatory (R) domain. The membrane-spanning domains of CFTR show topological similarity to those of other ABC transporters, but there is little sequence similarity. In contrast, the NBDs show significant sequence conservation throughout the family. In CFTR, the membrane-spanning domains form an anion-selective pore (4Dawson D.C. Smith S.S. Mansoura M.K. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: S47-S75Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar), and the activity of the cytoplasmic domains controls channel opening and closing (5Gadsby D.C. Nairn A.C. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: S77-S107Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar, 6Sheppard D.N. Welsh M.J. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: S23-S45Crossref PubMed Scopus (758) Google Scholar). Channel activity requires phosphorylation of the R domain. Then ATP binding and hydrolysis by the two NBDs determine gating. Previous studies have probed the structure and function of the CFTR NBDs by examining the functional consequences of applying nucleotide analogs and introducing site-directed mutations. Those studies have revealed different roles for NBD1 and NBD2 in channel gating. Several studies have also highlighted the role of ATP binding and hydrolysis in CFTR gating (for reviews, see Refs. 5Gadsby D.C. Nairn A.C. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: S77-S107Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar and 6Sheppard D.N. Welsh M.J. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: S23-S45Crossref PubMed Scopus (758) Google Scholar). Mutations of the conserved Walker A lysines (Lys-464 in NBD1 and Lys-1250 in NBD2) inhibit ATPase activity (7Ramjeesingh M. Li C. Garami E. Huan L.J. Galley K. Wang Y. Bear C.E.

However, the effects of mutations in the two NBDs are not symmetrical; the K1250A mutation dramatically prolongs the burst duration, whereas the K464A mutation reduces the frequency of channel opening but does not change burst duration. More recent studies have suggested that ATP binding without hydrolysis may be sufficient to open the channel (11Reddy M.M. Quinton P.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: C35-C42Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12Schultz B.D. Bridges R.J. Frizzell R.A. J. Membr. Biol. 1996; 151: 63-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 13Ikuma M. Welsh M.J.

Thus, the molecular mechanisms by which the ATP- and ADP-bound states of each of the two NBDs affect channel gating are not well understood. Recent work has described the three-dimensional crystal structures for the isolated NBDs of ABC transporters in the presence of ATP (15Hung L.W. Wang I.X. Nikaido K. Liu P.Q. Ames G.F.L. Kim S.H.

These structures provide us with the opportunity to model the amino acid contacts between the CFTR NBDs and nucleotide and to evaluate structural models for channel gating. In this study, we have tested specific predictions of such models using site-directed mutagenesis to alter key residues and patch-clamp electrophysiology to examine the functional consequences. The catalytic subunit of cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) was purchased from Promega. Lipofectin was obtained from Invitrogen. All other reagents were obtained from Sigma. CFTR mutants were prepared in the pTM1-CFTR4 plasmid (20Kunkel T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 488-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (4842) Google Scholar) (or QuikChange™, Stratagene). Mutations were verified by sequencing around the site of mutation. Wild type and mutant CFTR proteins were transiently expressed in HeLa cells using the vaccinia virus/T7 expression system as described previously (21Anderson M.P. Rich D.P. Gregory R.J. Cheng S. Smith A.E. Welsh M.J. Papa S. Azzi A. Tager J.M. Adenine Nucleotides in Cellular Energy Transfer and Signal Transduction. Birkhauser Verlag, Basel, Switzerland1992: 399-413Crossref Google Scholar). Cells were studied 6–24 h after transfection, depending on the level of expression desired. Methods for excised, inside-out patch-clamp recording were as described previously (22Carson M.R. Travis S.M. Welsh M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1711-1717Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar), except that experiments were performed at room temperature (21–23 °C). The pipette (extracellular) solution contained (in mm): 140N-methyl-d-glucamine, 100 aspartic acid, 35.5 HCl, 5 CaCl2, 2 MgCl2, 10 Tricine, pH 7.3 with 1 n HCl. The bath (intracellular) solution contained (in mm): 140 N-methyl-d-glucamine, 135.5 HCl, 3 MgCl2, 10 Tricine, 4 Cs(OH)2, 1 EGTA, 1 Na2ATP, pH 7.3 with 1 n HCl. Data were collected at −40 or −80 mV, filtered at 1 kHz using a variable eight-pole Bessel filter (Frequency Devices Inc., Haverhill, MA), and digitized at 5 kHz. Open state probability was determined from patches containing one to three channels. Single-channel data were analyzed with a burst delimiter of 20 ms. Data analysis was done using the pClamp 6.0 software package (Axon Instruments Inc., Foster City, CA). Data are shown as means ± S.E. Statistical significance was determined as indicated in the figure legends. p values of < 0.05 were considered statistically significant. The apparent EC50 for ATP-stimulated CFTR activity was determined by fitting data to the equation A=M·[ATP]/(EC50 +[ATP]) where A is the ATP-induced Cl− current and M is the fitted value for the current at saturating ATP concentrations. Fitting was done using a least squares method with IgorPro 2.04 software (WaveMetrics, Inc., Lake Oswego, OR). Karpowich et al. (17Karpowich N. Martsinkevich O. Millen L. Yuan Y. Dai P.L. MacVey K.

Chem. 2001; 276: 32313-32321Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). In the ATP-bound state, a conserved Gln (Gln-100 in HisP) contacts the γ-phosphate of ATP (Fig.1). Gln-100 lies at the amino-terminal end of a short segment of amino acids called the γ-phosphate linker. With ATP present, the γ-phosphate linker of the NBD stabilizes an α-helical subdomain in a fixed relationship to the ATP-binding core subdomain. In contrast, in the absence of nucleotides or with ADP bound (for example in LivG), the loss of contact with the γ-phosphate allows a conformational change to occur in the γ-phosphate linker, which facilitates outward rotation of the α-helical subdomain away from the ATP-binding core subdomain. Thus the presence or absence of the ATP γ-phosphate determines the position of the conserved Gln and hence the position of the α-helical subdomain via the γ-phosphate linker. As we note below, other structural interactions may also influence the position of the γ-phosphate linker. Based on this model, we examined the effect of two sets of mutations in CFTR (Gln and Asn) that we predicted would have different effects on the γ-phosphate linker and hence the position of the α-helical subdomain. We mutated the conserved Gln (Gln-493 in NBD1 and Gln-1291 in NBD2) that connects the γ-phosphate linker to the γ-phosphate of ATP (Fig. 1). We hypothesized that these mutations should destabilize the ATP-bound conformation of the NBD. They might alter the affinity of ATP binding, thereby reducing channel activity. The mutations might disrupt ATP hydrolysis, thereby altering durations of the open and closed states. Or by interfering with the ability to “sense” the ATP γ-phosphate, they might disrupt ATP-dependent movement of the γ-phosphate linker and the α-helical subdomain, thereby uncoupling the structural consequences of ATP binding and hydrolysis. We also mutated a highly conserved Asn (Asn-505 in NBD1 and Asn-1303 in NBD2 of CFTR). These align with Asn-102 of LivG, which mediates a set of hydrogen bonds with conserved residues in each conformation of the γ-phosphate linker. In the ATP-bound state, this conserved Asn (Asn-113 in HisP) connects via hydrogen bonds to the γ-phosphate linker. However, with ADP bound, hydrogen bond contacts with the γ-phosphate linker are disrupted, and hydrogen bonds form between a conserved Arg (Arg-166 in LivG) and the side chain of the Asn (Asn-102 in LivG) (17Karpowich N. Martsinkevich O. Millen L. Yuan Y. Dai P.L. MacVey K. Thomas P.J. Hunt J.F. Structure. 2001; 9: 571-586Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). These putative changes in bonding may favor an ADP-bound conformation in which the γ-phosphate linker is withdrawn from the nucleotide binding site (Fig. 1). We hypothesized that mutation of this conserved Asn would be more destabilizing to the ADP conformation and therefore favor the ATP conformation. In this case, the Asn mutations would be expected to reduce the rate of entry into the ADP conformation and subsequent nucleotide dissociation. Thus, whereas the Gln and Asn mutations would not have precisely opposite effects on the structure, these mutations might affect the γ-phosphate linker position in different ways. We introduced the mutations at the indicated sites, expressed the variant CFTR in HeLa cells, and examined CFTR channel activity in excised, inside-out patches of membrane. Because the two NBDs have different functions in CFTR gating (reviewed in Refs. 5Gadsby D.C. Nairn A.C. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: S77-S107Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar and 6Sheppard D.N. Welsh M.J. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: S23-S45Crossref PubMed Scopus (758) Google Scholar), we first show the effect of these mutations at NBD1 and then NBD2. Earlier models have suggested that ATP binding and/or hydrolysis at NBD1 are important for initiating channel activation and that ATP binding and hydrolysis at NBD2 are important in the opening and closing in a normal gating cycle. A trace of wild type CFTR reveals characteristic bursts of activity separated by closed interburst intervals (Fig. 2). In contrast, the Q493A variant exhibited a substantially reduced Po because of a prolonged interburst interval with little change in the burst duration (Fig. 2). This result is consistent with the hypothesis that removal of the conserved Gln reduces either its affinity for ATP or its ability to induce the conformational change in the γ-phosphate linker required for channel activation, resulting in a lower frequency of channel opening. It could also be explained by a reduced rate of ATP hydrolysis (see “Discussion”). In both HisP and Rad50, the conserved Gln side chain contacts the γ-phosphate of the bound nucleotide through a water molecule (15Hung L.W. Wang I.X. Nikaido K. Liu P.Q. Ames G.F.L. Kim S.H. Nature. 1998; 396: 703-707Crossref PubMed Scopus (601) Google Scholar,23Hopfner K.P. Karcher A. Shin D.S. Craig L. Arthur L.M. Carney J.P. Tainer J.A. Cell. 2000; 101: 789-800Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (783) Google Scholar). This arrangement suggested that mutating Gln might impair ATP binding. Because ATP binding may open the CFTR Cl−channel (13Ikuma M. Welsh M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 8675-8680Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 14Aleksandrov A.A. Chang X. Aleksandrov L. Riordan J.R. J. Physiol. 2000; 528: 259-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), thereby reducing the interburst interval, we asked if the prolonged interburst interval in Q493A was consistent with attenuated binding. To test this, we examined the effect of varying the ATP concentration. Wild type CFTR and CFTR-Q493A had the same apparent EC50 for ATP (Fig. 3). These data suggest that the conserved Gln is not critical for ATP binding. The Gln side chain also contacts Mg2+ in Rad50 (23Hopfner K.P. Karcher A. Shin D.S. Craig L. Arthur L.M. Carney J.P. Tainer J.A. Cell. 2000; 101: 789-800Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (783) Google Scholar). In HisP, which was crystallized in the absence of Mg2+, the Gln side chain contacts a H2O molecule that was assumed to take the place of Mg2+ (15Hung L.W. Wang I.X. Nikaido K. Liu P.Q. Ames G.F.L. Kim S.H. Nature. 1998; 396: 703-707Crossref PubMed Scopus (601) Google Scholar). If the conserved Gln in CFTR is a critical contact for the divalent cation, we expected that a Gln mutation would alter the functional consequences of changing the divalent cation. In wild type CFTR, the relative order of current stimulation is CaATP > MgATP > Na2ATP (13Ikuma M. Welsh M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 8675-8680Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 24Harrington M.A. Gunderson K.L. Kopito R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27536-27544Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Moreover, mutation of the NBD2 Walker B Asp, which also contacts the Mg2+, abolishes differential effects of Mg2+and Ca2+ compared with ATP alone (13Ikuma M. Welsh M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 8675-8680Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Fig.4 shows that varying the divalent cation generated similar effects for wild type CFTR and the Q493A variant. These results suggest that contact between the conserved Gln and the divalent cation is not critical to this function. ADP inhibits and pyrophosphate (PPi) stimulates CFTR Cl− current (9Gunderson K.L. Kopito R.R. Cell. 1995; 82: 231-239Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar, 21Anderson M.P.

Physiol. 1995; 105: 329-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). These effects appear to be mediated predominantly through an interaction at NBD2. The Q493A mutation did not alter the response to either agent (Figs.5 and6). The N505C mutation had an effect opposite to that of Q493A; it reduced the interburst interval and increased Po (Fig.7). As with Q493A, burst duration did not change. CFTR-N505A had gating kinetics similar to those of wild type; presumably the introduced Ala did not disrupt the structure to the same extent as when Cys was substituted for Asn. The effect of the Cys mutation can be explained by destabilization of the ADP conformation of the loop promoting faster entry into the channel-activating ATP conformation. Inhibition by ADP, stimulation by PPi, and the EC50 for ATP stimulation were not altered by the N505C or N505A mutations (data not shown). The opposite effects of the Q493A and N505C mutations on gating are consistent with the expectation that these mutations might have different effects on the γ-phosphate linker. In contrast to the NBD1 Gln mutant, the NBD2 Gln variant Q1291A showed gating much like wild type (Fig. 2). These results indicate that the two NBDs in CFTR do not have equivalent functions in controlling gating; this conclusion is consistent with that drawn from earlier studies (9Gunderson K.L. Kopito R.R. Cell. 1995; 82: 231-239Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar, 10Zeltwanger S. Wang F. Wang G.T. Gillis K.D. Hwang T.C. J. Gen.

Chem. 1995; 270: 1711-1717Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). Previous studies have also suggested that termination of an open burst depends upon ATP binding and hydrolysis at NBD2. For example, the CFTR-K1250A mutant markedly prolongs burst duration (9Gunderson K.L. Kopito R.R. Cell. 1995; 82: 231-239Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar, 10Zeltwanger S.

Chem. 1995; 270: 1711-1717Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). Thus the normal burst duration in Q1291A suggests that mutation of the conserved Gln did not disrupt hydrolysis. Wild type CFTR and CFTR-Q1291A had the same apparent EC50for ATP (Fig. 3) and the same response to variation of the divalent cation (Fig. 4). These results suggest that Gln-1291 is not a key factor in ATP binding or hydrolysis. In the ADP-bound state, the conserved Gln of LivG MJ1267 (Gln-89), LolD MJ0796 (Gln-90), and TAP1 (Gln-586) does not have the opportunity to contact a γ-phosphate and makes no direct contacts with the β-phosphate of ADP (17Karpowich N.

In CFTR, ADP inhibits channel activity, at least in part by competitively inhibiting ATP binding (27Schultz B.D. Venglarik C.J. Bridges R.J. Frizzell R.A. J. Gen. Physiol. 1995; 105: 329-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 28Winter M.C. Sheppard D.N. Carson M.R. Welsh M.J. Biophys.

This effect is abolished by some NBD2 mutations (21Anderson M.P. Rich D.P. Gregory R.J. Cheng S. Smith A.E. Welsh M.J. Papa S. Azzi A. Tager J.M. Adenine Nucleotides in Cellular Energy Transfer and Signal Transduction. Birkhauser Verlag, Basel, Switzerland1992: 399-413Crossref Google Scholar). The fact that the Gln does not interact with ADP bound to the model bacterial NBDs, coupled with our finding that the Gln mutations did not appear to inhibit ATP binding, predicted that the Gln mutations would not alter ADP-dependent inhibition of current. Fig. 5 shows that this was the case. PPi and AMP-PNP applied with ATP lock channels open by prolonging the burst duration (22Carson M.R. Travis S.M. Welsh M.J. J. Biol.

It is thought that PPi and AMP-PNP bind tightly in an open-channel configuration and that the channel closes with dissociation of PPi or the non-hydrolyzable nucleotide. Several NBD2 mutations, but not equivalent NBD1 mutations, abolish PPistimulation (9Gunderson K.L. Kopito R.R. Cell. 1995; 82: 231-239Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). 2M. R. Carson, A. L. Berger, and M. J. Welsh, unpublished results. This effect may be mediated at NBD2, although a recent report showed that the nucleotide base of AMP-PNP interacts with NBD1, suggesting more complicated explanations (33Aleksandrov L. Mengos A. Chang X. Aleksandrov A. Riordan J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12918-12923Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Despite the lack of effect of the Q1291A mutation on other aspects of gating, it dramatically reduced PPi stimulation (Fig. 6). This result suggests that an interaction with the conserved NBD2 Gln is critical to either stabilizing the bound polyphosphate or transducing the signal generated by its binding. In addition to its role in determining structure, we were interested in Asn-1303 mutations because they are associated with CF (34Osborne L. Santis G. Schwarz M. Klinger K. Dork T. McIntosh I. Schwartz M. Nunes V. Macek Jr., M. Reiss J. et al.Hum. Genet. 1992; 89: 653-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The single-channel gating of CFTR-N1303K, a relatively frequent CF-associated mutation, showed a long burst duration and a long interburst interval (Fig.8). We observed similar kinetic effects when Asn-1303 was changed to another CF-associated mutation (N1303H), a sequenced mutation with undetermined clinical consequences (N1303I), and an Ala (N1303A) (Fig. 8). These functional consequences are similar to those observed with mutations of Lys-1250, which disrupt ATP hydrolysis and probably binding (7Ramjeesingh M. Li C. Garami E. Huan L.J. Galley K. Wang Y.

To further examine similarities between CFTR-N1303K and CFTR-K1250A, we examined the effect of PPiand ADP. The N1303K mutation prevented PPi-dependent stimulation of current and eliminated ADP-dependent current inhibition (Fig.9). Pyrophosphate caused only a 26.9 ± 18.6% (n = 4) increase in current for the CFTR-N1303K channel, and ADP caused only a 3.2 ± 6.8% (n = 3) inhibition in current. However, in contrast to the reduced EC50 for ATP observed for mutations at Lys-1250 (21Anderson M.P. Rich D.P. Gregory R.J. Cheng S. Smith A.E. Welsh M.J. Papa S. Azzi A. Tager J.M. Adenine Nucleotides in Cellular Energy Transfer and Signal Transduction. Birkhauser Verlag, Basel, Switzerland1992: 399-413Crossref Google Scholar), the apparent EC50 for CFTR-N1303A (253 ± 62 μm, n = 5) was not different from that of wild type CFTR (176 ± 67 μm, n = 5). We hypothesized that amino acid contacts with the NBD γ-phosphate linker are an important determinant of NBD function. By combining knowledge of the structure of related NBDs with measurements of CFTR gating, our results provide insight into the relationship between structure and function of CFTR and other ABC transporters in the region of the γ-phosphate linker. Mutations of the conserved Gln and Asn did not alter the EC50 for ATP-dependent current stimulation. These results suggest that disrupting the interaction of the γ-phosphate linker with ATP is not critical for ATP binding. Whether the Gln and Asn mutations disrupt hydrolysis by CFTR NBDs is not known. We can, however, compare the gating of the Gln and Asn mutants with the behavior of channels with Walker A lysine mutations, which are known to disrupt hydrolysis (7Ramjeesingh M. Li C. Garami E. Huan L.J. Galley K. Wang Y. Bear C.E. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 1463-1468Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). The Asn-1303 mutations prolonged the burst duration and increased the interburst interval, gating changes similar to mutations of the NBD2 Walker A lysine (9Gunderson K.L. Kopito R.R. Cell. 1995; 82: 231-239Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar, 10Zeltwanger S. Wang F. Wang G.T. Gillis K.D. Hwang T.C. J. Gen.

Pulmonol. 1995; 12: 10.7Google Scholar). The Gln-493 mutation increased the interburst interval without affecting the burst duration, similar to the behavior of channels with mutation of the NBD1 Walker A lysine (9Gunderson K.L. Kopito R.R. Cell. 1995; 82: 231-239Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar, 10Zeltwanger S. Wang F. Wang G.T. Gillis K.D. Hwang T.C. J. Gen.

Pulmonol. 1995; 12: 10.7Google Scholar). However, mutations of Asn-505 and Gln-1291 were not consistent with the gating effects expected of mutations that disrupt hydrolysis. Therefore, we surmise that the Gln and Asn mutations probably have, at most, modest effects on hydrolysis. The conclusions that the Gln and Asn mutations did not inhibit ATP binding or abolish hydrolysis are consistent with other studies. In HisP, the Q100L mutation showed normal ATP binding although the rate of histidine transport was reduced (36Shyamala V. Baichwal V. Beall E. Ames G.F.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 18714-18719Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In P-glycoprotein (Pgp), mutation of the conserved glutamine in either NBD1 or NBD2 caused no change in the apparent affinity for ATP, the Mg2+ requirement, or transition state trapping. Moreover, these mutations only modestly reduced the ATPase rate (37Urbatsch I.L. Gimi K. Wilke-Mounts S. Senior A.E. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 11921-11927Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). In LivG, mutation of the equivalent Gln residue did not change the Km for ATP and decreased hydrolysis only modestly. 3L. Millen, J. F. Hunt, and P. J. Thomas, manuscript in preparation. Thus, the γ-phosphate linker is probably not critical for either ATP binding or hydrolysis. An ATP-induced change in the position of the γ-phosphate linker may be a key event, or one of several key events, that couples ATP binding and hydrolysis to gating of the channel. This mechanism has been proposed for Pgp, for which the conserved Gln residue coupled ATP binding and hydrolysis to transmembrane transport (37Urbatsch I.L. Gimi K. Wilke-Mounts S. Senior A.E. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 11921-11927Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). In CFTR, the requirement for Gln-1291 to mediate the effects of an activating polyphosphate supports this hypothesis. We hypothesize that the γ-phosphate of ATP contacts the side chain of Gln-1291 (possibly through a water molecule), influencing the position of the γ-phosphate linker and α-helical subdomain, and thereby maintaining the channel in an open state. Our finding that mutation of equivalent residues in the two NBDs produced different gating patterns is consistent with earlier work indicating that the two NBDs have different functions in gating CFTR (9Gunderson K.L. Kopito R.R. Cell. 1995; 82: 231-239Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar, 10Zeltwanger S. Wang F. Wang G.T. Gillis K.D. Hwang T.C. J. Gen.

A. 1999; 96: 1268-1272Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 39Lapinski P.E. Neubig R.R. Raghavan M. J. Biol.

Chem. 2001; 276: 11653-11661Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). For example, in CFTR movement of the γ-phosphate linker in NBD1 may be part of an “activating” mechanism that allows NBD2 to play the predominant role in gating the channel (13Ikuma M. Welsh M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 8675-8680Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Although the details of how conformational changes in the NBDs cause opening and closing of the channel remain untested, the very recent crystal structure of the Escherichia coli MsbA transporter indicates that the NBDs are likely to transmit a conformational signal to the membrane-spanning domains, and are unlikely to interact directly with the channel pore (41Chang G. Roth C.B. Science. 2001; 293: 1793-1800Crossref PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar). Based on the structural differences in ATP-bound, ADP-bound, and nucleotide-free NBDs, Karpowich et al. (17Karpowich N. Martsinkevich O. Millen L. Yuan Y. Dai P.L. MacVey K. Thomas P.J. Hunt J.F. Structure. 2001; 9: 571-586Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar) proposed that an ATP-induced alteration in the affinity between the two NBDs controls their interaction, thereby converting chemical into mechanical energy. Their analysis suggested that the position of the α-helical subdomain contributes to NBD-NBD interactions and hence the activity of the transporter. Specifically, when ATP is bound, inward rotation of the α-helical subdomain may promote NBD-NBD interactions that activate the transporter. Such a model is also consistent with a structural relationship between the transmembrane domain and NBD of MsbA (41Chang G. Roth C.B. Science. 2001; 293: 1793-1800Crossref PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar). Some of the mutations we studied have been observed in patients with CF. N1303K is a frequent CF-associated mutation that has been shown to affect channel processing (42Gregory R.J. Rich D.P. Cheng S.H. Souza D.W. Paul S. Manavalan P. Anderson M.P. Welsh M.J. Smith A.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 3886-3893Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Our data indicate that this mutation also affects channel gating and reduces Po. N1303H and N1303I also alter channel gating although their effect on Po was minor. Because these are rare variations, it is not clear whether or not they cause CF. Two relatively uncommon missense mutations have been described at Gln-1291, Q1291H and Q1291R (43Jones C.T. McIntosh I. Keston M. Ferguson A. Brock D.J. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1992; 1: 11-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), 4www.genet.sickkids.on.ca. and a single chromosome was reported to encode a variation at Gln-493, Q493R.4 The relatively mild gating abnormalities we observed for these variants suggest that if they cause CF, altered processing or some other abnormality may be the cause for the loss of CFTR function.

The functions associated with ICP34.5 suggest that ICP34.5 should be present in different parts of the infected cell. Proliferating cell nuclear antigen is located in the nucleus (reviewed in Ref. 24.Warbrick E. BioEssays. 2000; 22: 997-1006Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar), whereas PP1 is present in the nucleus (25.Allen P.B. Kwon Y.G. Nairn A.C. Greengard P. J. Biol.

Interestingly, protein kinase R is also present in both the cytoplasm and the nucleus, where it is specifically localized to the nucleolus in association with ribosomes (28.Raine D.A. Jeffrey I.W.

A previous study using immunofluorescence microscopy suggested that ICP34.5 is present only in the cytoplasm of infected cells (30.McKie E.A. Hope R.G. Brown S.M. MacLean A.R. J. Gen. Virol. 1994; 75: 733-741Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), but in other studies, ICP34.5 was associated with cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions of infected cells (17.He B. Chou J.

In this study, the influence of the N-terminal arginine-rich region and the PAT repeat region of ICP34.5 on the cellular localization of ICP34.5 was evaluated by comparing the properties of natural variants of ICP34.5 from two families of HSV-1 strains. Although the protein sequence of the C-terminal region of ICP34.5 and most of the rest of the protein is highly conserved, a major difference between these strains is the number of PAT repeats in the middle region and the number of arginines at the N terminus of ICP34.5 (Fig. 1) (13.Bower J.R.

KOS321 is highly passaged and completely attenuated for disease (13.Bower J.R. Mao H. Durishin C. Rozenbom E. Detwiler M. Rempinski D. Karban T.L. Rosenthal K.S. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 3843-3853Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and KOS79 is a low passage strain that can cause neuroinvasive disease (38.Dix R.D. McKendall R.R. Baringer J.R. Infect. Immun. 1983; 40: 103-112Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Due to the low expression of the ICP34.5 protein in the natural HSV-1 infection and the difficulty in the development of effective and specific antibodies against ICP34.5 (30.McKie E.A. Hope R.G. Brown S.M. MacLean A.R. J. Gen. Virol. 1994; 75: 733-741Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 37.McKay E.M. McVey B. Marsden H.S. Brown S.M. MacLean A.R. J. Gen. Virol. 1993; 74: 2493-2497Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), an alternative approach was taken. The natural variants of the ICP34.5 gene from SP7, LP5, KOS321, and KOS79 were amplified by PCR and cloned into mammalian expression vectors to generate fusion proteins with a reporter peptide (c-Myc or hrGFP) at the C terminus. Studies of the expression and cell distribution of these recombinant proteins upon transfection into Vero cells and SK-N-SH neuroblastoma cells demonstrated that the N-terminal Arg-rich cluster was necessary and sufficient for determining ICP34.5 localization in the cell; however, the length of the PAT repeats in the middle region of the ICP34.5 variants is the ultimate determinant of the cellular location of the protein. In addition, PP1 colocalized with the ICP34.5 variant in the cells expressing ICP34.5. These studies show that the peptide sequence-determined cellular localization of ICP34.5 is a determinant in the function of the protein and hence may influence the tissue culture behavior and the virulence of HSV-1. Vero cells were grown in medium 199 supplemented with 5% fetal calf serum, penicillin (100 IU/ml), streptomycin (100 μg/ml), and 2.25 mm NaHCO3 at 37 °C. SK-N-SH cells were grown in Eagle's minimal essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 1.0 mm sodium pyruvate, and the same amount of antibiotics and NaHCO3 as described for Vero cells. The isolation and characteristics of the clinical strains, SP7 and LP5 (13.Bower J.R. Mao H. Durishin C. Rozenbom E. Detwiler M. Rempinski D. Karban T.L. Rosenthal K.S. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 3843-3853Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and KOS79 (38.Dix R.D. McKendall R.R. Baringer J.R. Infect. Immun. 1983; 40: 103-112Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) have been described. KOS321 is a plaque-purified and highly passaged strain provided by T. Holland (Wayne State University School of Medicine) (39.Holland T.C. Marlin S.D. Levine M. Glorioso J. J. Virol. 1983; 45: 672-682Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The ICP34.5 deletion mutant (d34.5) and the parental McKrae strain were provided by G. C. Perng (Cedars Sinai Medical Center) (40.Perng G.C. Thompson R.L. Sawtell N.M. Taylor W.E. Slanina S.M. Ghiasi H. Kaiwar R. Nesburn A.B. Wechsler S.L. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 3033-3041Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). HSV-1 uses the latter of two start codons (ATG) as its start codon (15.Chou J. Roizman B. J. Virol. 1990; 64: 1014-1020Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To truly express the ICP34.5 gene in fusion with c-Myc and His6, two PCR primers were synthesized in which the first start codon (ATG) and the stop codon (TAA) of the ICP34.5 gene were mutated, respectively, as indicated by the underlines: MU34 (5′-CTGCACGCACTTGCTTGCCT-3′) and 34MU (5′-CTCGGGTGTAACGATAGACC-3′) (Sigma, Genosys). PCR amplification was performed using DNA purified from SP7-, LP5-, KOS79-, and KOS321-infected cells (Wizard Genomic DNA purification kit; Promega). Due to the high guanosine/cytosine content of the sequence, PCR was performed using the MasterAmpTM PCR optimization kit (premixture KN; Epicentre) and tfl polymerase (Epicentre) as previously described (13.Bower J.R. Mao H. Durishin C. Rozenbom E. Detwiler M. Rempinski D. Karban T.L. Rosenthal K.S. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 3843-3853Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The PCR-amplified products were ligated into the PCRTM2.1 vector (Invitrogen) with T4 DNA ligase (Promega). Each of the insertions was examined by restriction digestion and sequencing (M. Detweiler, Roswell Park Cancer Institute, University of Buffalo) to check on the fidelity of the PCR and cloning amplification procedures. The cloned PCR DNA fragment was cleaved from the PCRTM2.1 vector with EcoRI and ligated into the pcDNA3.1 myc-His B(−) vector (Invitrogen), which was linearized with EcoRI. The purified recombinant DNAs were named kos321m, sp7a, lp5a, and kos79a, representing the ICP34.5 variants cloned from the respective HSV-1 strains. These recombinant DNAs were sequenced to make sure that the genes encoding the myc-His6 epitopes are in the reading frame with the inserted ICP34.5. PCR-amplified ICP34.5 variants cloned into the PCRTM2.1 vector were cut with BamHI and XhoI. The small DNA fragment, including the ICP34.5 gene, was purified and ligated with the hrGFP fragment cleaved from the hrGFP vector (VitalityTM, Stratagene) by the same enzymes. The recombinant DNAs were confirmed by sequencing. A new PCR primer (T34, 5′-CCATGGGCGCGGTCCCAACC-3′) was synthesized to initiate the sequence downstream of the N-terminal Arg-rich cluster from a new start codon (underlined in the T34 sequence). Truncated ICP34.5 genes were amplified by PCR using the new T34 primer and the 34MU primer (described above) and cloned into the pcDNA3.1myc-His vector. The truncated genes derived from kos321m and sp7a are named tkos321 and tsp7, respectively. The mutant ICP34.5-myc gene was confirmed by sequencing. PCR was performed using two new primers (AR5, 5′-TGTGCTGGATATCTGCAGAATTCGGCT-3′; ar3, AGGCCTCGAGCTGTGCGGTTGGGACCG-3′), which incorporate restriction enzyme sites for EcoRI and XhoI, respectively. Plasmid DNA variants including kos321m, sp7a, and kos79a were used as templates. The amplified products encompassed a 5′ noncoding region and a leading sequence encoding the ICP34.5 N-terminal Arg-rich cluster. The products were cut with EcoRI and XhoI and ligated with an hrGFP fragment cleaved from the hrGFP vector with the same enzymes. The recombinant DNAs were named for the ICP34.5 variants, which provided the Arg-rich cluster and were sequenced to make sure that the insertion was present and in the reading frame with hrGFP. Recombinant DNAs kos321m and sp7a were cut with NotI to produce two fragments. The small fragment, which includes the N-terminal Arg-rich cluster from one plasmid, was ligated with the large fragment containing the remaining segment of the ICP34.5 gene from the other plasmid to generate hybrid recombinant ICP34.5 DNA. The 7nKb has the first 44 amino acids from SP7 and a KOS321-like backbone, whereas the Kn7b has the first 43 amino acids from KOS321 and an SP7-like backbone. The new constructs were also sequenced. Recombinant DNA was transfected into Vero cells or SK-N-SH cells using LipofectAMINE PLUS (Invitrogen). After 2 days, cells were either lysed and analyzed by Western blot or processed for immunocytochemistry. SK-N-SH cells were transfected with the ICP34.5-Myc DNA variants. After the cells reached confluence (3–4 days), the cells were grown with M199 containing 0.5% fetal calf serum for another 2–3 days and then infected by a null ICP34.5 mutant of HSV-1 (d34.5) (40.Perng G.C. Thompson R.L. Sawtell N.M. Taylor W.E. Slanina S.M. Ghiasi H. Kaiwar R. Nesburn A.B. Wechsler S.L. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 3033-3041Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) at a multiplicity of infection of 2. After 2 days, the supernatant and the infected cells were collected separately after centrifugation (12,000 × g, 2 min). After freeze, thaw, and sonication, viral plaque assays were performed on Vero cells. A specific antibody to ICP34.5 was developed against a peptide (AQSQVTSTPNSEPVVC) near the N terminus of the ICP34.5 protein (QCB, Hopkinton, MA). The peptide was attached to keyhole limpet hemocyanin, ovalbumin, and then tetanus toxoid, and rabbits were immunized four times with each immunogen. Sera were collected after each procedure. The antisera were purified by affinity chromatography on a peptide-agarose column. Monoclonal anti-Myc, anti-Myc-horseradish peroxidase (HRP), and goat anti-mouse TRITC (TRITC-GAM) antiserum were purchased from Invitrogen. The polyclonal anti-PP1 (FL-18) antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) used in this study was generated to a peptide present in most forms of PP1. Cells were lysed by radioimmune precipitation assay lysis buffer (100 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 1% Triton X-100, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS) in the presence of a protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma) and DNase I (100 μg/ml; Sigma) at 48 h after transfection. Samples were mixed with an SDS-PAGE gel loading buffer (2% SDS, 80 mm Tris, pH 6.8, 32% glycerol, 0.001% bromphenol blue, 5% β-mercaptoethanol) and boiled. The lysates were separated by electrophoresis on 10–20% SDS-PAGE gels and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. The membranes were blotted with anti-Myc-HRP or anti-peptide antibody followed by goat anti-rabbit conjugated with HRP. The signals were examined by chemiluminescence using ECL (Amersham Biosciences), and the x-ray films were digitized with an HP scanner to produce the final images. Vero cells, transfected with the ICP34.5 expression vector, were seeded onto coverslips and cultured overnight. These cells were then fixed with cold acetone for 10 min. After the samples dried, they were blocked by normal mouse serum and then incubated with anti-Myc-HRP for 1 h at 37 °C. After washing with PBS, these cells were stained by immersing in the disclosing reaction mixture, including diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride and hydrogen peroxide, for 7 min. Samples were further dehydrated by immersing sequentially in a series of graded alcohols (70, 95, and 100%) and then in xylene and mounted with Permount. Photomicrographs were obtained using an Olympus B-max 60. Transfected cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 min and permeabilized in 0.2% Triton X-100 for 5 min. After incubation with 0.1 m glycine and 1% bovine serum albumin, the cells were incubated with anti-Myc monoclonal antibody (Invitrogen) in the presence of 1% bovine serum albumin for 1 h. After washing, these fixed cells were incubated with FITC-GAM or TRITC-GAM for another 1 h. The cells were then treated with equilibration buffer and mounted using the SlowFade-light antifade kit (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR) and viewed by fluorescence microscopy (Olympus AX70) or confocal microscopy (Olympus IX70). The digital images were obtained and analyzed by Spot Advance software (Diagnostic instruments, Inc.). For colocalization studies, organelle-specific dyes such as propidium iodide for the nucleus, or DiOC6(3) for the ER (41.Terasaki M. Song J. Wong J.R. Weiss M.J. Chen L.B. Cell. 1984; 38: 101-108Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar) were used at concentrations of 5 μg/ml and 2.5 μg/ml, respectively, during the incubation with the secondary antibodies. DNA encoding ICP34.5 was obtained from each of the HSV-1 strains by PCR amplification using primers from the ends of the coding sequence. The PCR products from each variant were sequenced, and the DNA sequences were aligned and converted to peptide sequences using the multiple alignment program and six frame translation programs (Sequence Launcher, BCM) (42.Smith R.F. Wiese B.A. Wojzynski M.K. Davison D.B. Worley K.C. Genome Res. 1996; 6: 454-462Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The ICP34.5 genes from SP7, LP5, KOS79, and KOS321 strains had extensive homology except for major sequence differences in the number of repeats of CCC GCG ACC, encoding PAT, in the middle region of the gene and the CGC repeats at the N terminus encoding a string of Arg (e.g. RRRRHRGPRRPR for LP5) (Fig. 1) (13.Bower J.R. Mao H. Durishin C. Rozenbom E. Detwiler M. Rempinski D. Karban T.L. Rosenthal K.S. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 3843-3853Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15.Chou J. Roizman B. J. Virol. 1990; 64: 1014-1020Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The sequence of the SP7 ICP34.5 used in this and subsequent studies differs from that reported in Bower et al. (13.Bower J.R. Mao H. Durishin C. Rozenbom E. Detwiler M. Rempinski D. Karban T.L. Rosenthal K.S. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 3843-3853Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) in that the Gly-Glu-Gly-Ala (GEGA) at positions 153–156 (with respect to the LP5 sequence) is present. As a result, the only difference between the SP7 and the LP5 ICP34.5 is the number of the PAT repeats, with 18 and 22, respectively. The numbers of PAT repeats in the ICP34.5 from LP5 and SP7 are larger than for other HSV-1 strains that have been reported (15.Chou J. Roizman B. J. Virol. 1990; 64: 1014-1020Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 37.McKay E.M. McVey B. Marsden H.S. Brown S.M. MacLean A.R. J. Gen. Virol. 1993; 74: 2493-2497Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The ICP34.5 from LP5 and SP7 have 8 Arg residues in the N-terminal Arg cluster. The ICP34.5 protein from KOS79, another low passage strain, has 11 PAT repeats and nine Arg residues, while the KOS321 ICP34.5 has only three PAT repeats and seven Arg residues. Single amino acid polymorphisms are noted between SP7, LP5, and KOS321 at positions 140, 158, and 227, with respect to the LP5 sequence (13.Bower J.R. Mao H. Durishin C. Rozenbom E. Detwiler M. Rempinski D. Karban T.L. Rosenthal K.S. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 3843-3853Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The KOS79 ICP34.5 has the following residues: Ala140, Glu158, and Ala227. In addition, the KOS79 ICP34.5 has Gly instead of Ser at position 54, Glu instead of Ala at position 161, insertion of Asp between positions 81 and 82, and deletion of Leu and Arg between positions 148 and 149. The C-terminal GADD34-like sequence is identical for all of the HSV-1 strains. The PCR products of the ICP34.5 variants were cloned into the pcDNA3.1 myc-His expression vector (Invitrogen) with c-myc and His6 at the C terminus. Each of the new vectors was sequenced to confirm the insertion of the proper sequences. Vero cells were transfected with the same amount of recombinant DNA for each of the variants, and after 2 days, protein samples were obtained from the same number of cells and analyzed by Western blot. Polypeptides with the same mobility were detected from cells transfected with ICP34.5-myc DNA variants with either an anti-Myc monoclonal antibody or a polyclonal antibody developed against a peptide (AQSQVTSTPNSEPVVC) near the N terminus of the ICP34.5 protein. Detection of identical polypeptides for the fusion protein with antibodies raised against epitopes at the N and C termini (c-Myc epitope) indicate that the complete recombinant proteins were expressed (Fig. 2). Although useful, the anti-peptide antibody was too weak for use in subsequent studies. The expressed ICP34.5-Myc variants differed in mobility with apparent molecular masses ranging from 40 to 60 kDa. The ICP34.5 from the LP5 and KOS321 strains were the largest and smallest, respectively, while the ICP34.5 from SP7 was slightly smaller than from LP5. The KOS79 ICP34.5 had a medium size in comparison with the proteins from LP5 and KOS321. Minor bands with faster mobility, which may correspond to degradation prod"

C., and Zanetta, J. P. (2001) J. Biol. Chem. 276, 5685–5691). Using high affinity oligosaccharide ligands, it is demonstrated that this lectin activity is responsible for the early dephosphorylation of tyrosine residues found on specific proteins induced by interleukin 6 in human resting lymphocytes. The gp130 glycoprotein, the signal-transducing molecule of the IL-6 pathway, is itself a molecule possessing the HNK-1 epitope. This indicates that IL-6 is a bi-functional molecule able to extracellularly associate its α-receptor with the gp130 surface complex. Computational modeling indicates that the lower energy conformers of the high affinity ligands of IL-6 have a common structure. Docking experiments of these conformers suggest that the carbohydrate recognition domain of IL-6 is localized in the domain previously identified as site 3 of IL-6 (Somers, W., Stahl, M., and Seehra, J. S. (1997) EMBO J. 16, 989–997), already known to be involved in interactions with gp130.

Indeed, in resting human T cells, IL-2 recognizes with a high affinity oligomannosidic N-glycans with 5 and 6 mannose residues found on one N-glycosylated form of CD3. The IL-2 signaling (tyrosine phosphorylation of IL-2Rβby p56lck) is entirely dependent upon this specific lectin/carbohydrate interaction, and interference with oligomannosides of pathogens could be responsible for severe immunodeficiencies (19.Zanetta J.P.

Maes E. Strecker G. Carbohydr. Res. 1997; 302: 179-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). One of these compounds showed a very strong inhibitory property of the binding of IL-6 to the glycoprotein HNK-1 epitope, suggesting that it was a much higher affinity ligand than the glycoprotein HNK-1 epitope. However, other compounds having the glucuronic acid 3-sulfate group were extremely low affinity ligands, suggesting that they did not possess either conformations or additional groups necessary for the binding to IL-6. By using this IL-6 high affinity ligand in cultures of resting human lymphocytes, it is demonstrated that the lectin activity of IL-6 is responsible for the IL-6-induced dephosphorylations of tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins. One major glycoprotein ligand of IL-6 having the HNK-1 epitope is gp130 itself. Docking experiments of the lower affinity conformers (determined by computational calculations) of the identified oligosaccharide ligands of IL-6 suggest that the CRD of IL-6 overlaps with site 3 of IL-6, previously identified as a site implicated in the association with gp130. These data propose new concepts for the interactions between the IL-6 receptor and its signal-transducing molecule gp130. The recombinant human IL-6 (produced in bacteria) and its polyclonal rabbit antibody were from Chemicon International Inc. (Temecula, CA). The monoclonal mouse anti-phosphotyrosine antibody was from Upstate Biotechnology (Lake Placid, NY). Anti-phosphoserine, anti-phosphothreonine, alkaline phosphatase-labeled anti-rabbit and anti-mouse IgG, normal goat serum, bovine serum albumin (BSA), RPMI 1640 culture medium, Brij97 detergent, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, p-tosyl-arginine methyl ester, nitro blue tetrazolium, 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate, α2-microglobulin, and leupeptin were from Sigma. The serum from the patient with IgM paraproteinemia was kindly provided by Dr. N. Baumann (Laboratoire de Neurobiologie, Hôpital de la Salpétrière, Paris). MAG was purified from adult rat brain myelin (46.Norton W.T. Poduslo S.E. J. Neurochem. 1973; 21: 749-757Crossref PubMed Scopus (1268) Google Scholar) according to Quarles and Pasnak (47.Quarles R.H. Pasnak C. Biochem. J. 1977; 163: 635-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The P0 glycoprotein was prepared from rat sciatic nerve myelin according to Kitamura et al. (48.Kitamura K. Suzuki M. Uyemura K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1976; 455: 806-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). The HNK-1 oligosaccharide alditol ligands of IL-6 were obtained from the mucins of the eggs of R. temporaria (45.Florea D. Maes E. Strecker G. Carbohydr. Res. 1997; 302: 179-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) as their homologues (49.Coppin A. Maes E. Flahaut C. Coddeville B. Strecker G. Eur. J.

Nitrocellulose (0.45 μm pore size) was from Schleicher & Schuell (Dassel, Germany). Periodate-treated BSA was obtained according to Glass et al. (Ref. 51.Glass II, W.F. Briggs R.C. Hnilica L.S. Anal. Biochem. 1981; 115: 219-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar; this treatment allows the elimination of interferences due to the presence of glycoconjugates in commercially available BSA preparations). Peripheral blood lymphocytes of normal individuals were isolated by Ficoll-Paque centrifugation. After elimination of adherent cells on plastic for 30 min in RPMI 1640 containing 10% fetal calf serum, cells (2 × 107 cells) were maintained at 37 °C in a water-saturated atmosphere containing 5% CO2 before treatment. These cells were treated as follows. (i) For testing the effects of IL-6 and of IL-6 and its R. temporaria ligand on phosphorylations, cells were washed three times in serum-free RPMI 1640 and supplemented or not with IL-6 (20 ng/ml) or IL-6 plus its ligand (1 nm). After 15 min at 37 °C, cells were harvested in ice-cooled phosphate-buffered saline, washed twice in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, boiled for 5 min in the Laemmli dissociating buffer (52.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207159) Google Scholar), and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. After transfer onto nitrocellulose (53.Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44915) Google Scholar), the blots were revealed using anti-phosphotyrosine, anti-phosphoserine, or anti-phosphothreonine monoclonal antibodies, followed by AKP-labeled rabbit anti-mouse IgG and nitro blue tetrazolium/5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate staining (54.Leary J.J. Brigati D.J. Ward D.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 4045-4049Crossref PubMed Scopus (904) Google Scholar). (ii) For testing the presence of HNK-1 epitope on gp130, 107 cells were washed in phosphate-buffered saline and lysed at 4 °C in 750 μl of 10 mm Tris-HCl buffer at pH 7.4 containing 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 50 μg/ml periodate-treated BSA, and 1% (v/v) Brij97 (55.Hatakeyama M. Kono T. Kobayashi N. Kawahara A. Levin S.D. Perlmutter R.M. Taniguchi T. Science. 1991; 252: 1523-1528Crossref PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar) supplemented with protease inhibitors (10 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 mm p-tosyl-arginine methyl ester, 20 μg/ml microglobulin, and 10 μm leupeptin). After elimination of the nuclei by centrifugation (12,500 × g for 15 min at 4 °C), the supernatants were diluted once with an equal volume of 10 mm Tris-HCl buffer containing 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, and 1% deoxycholate and immunoprecipitated by addition of a 1/1000 dilution of the serum of a patient with paraproteinemia (overnight at 4 °C). After centrifugation, the pellet was centrifuged and washed ten times by centrifugation (10 min at 12,000 rpm) with the immunoprecipitation buffer and finally with phosphate-buffered saline. The final pellet was boiled in the Laemmli dissociating buffer and submitted to 10% SDS-PAGE, followed by blotting on nitrocellulose. Blots were revealed using the mouse monoclonal anti-gp130 antibody, followed by an AKP-labeled anti-mouse IgG antibody. Controls were performed using normal human serum instead of the pathological serum. In another series of experiments, resting human lymphocytes and HepG2 cells were lysed as above and immunoprecipitated using the serum of the patient with IgM paraproteinemia. After extensive washing in the lysis buffer, the immunoprecipitates were submitted to SDS-PAGE and silver stained. The conformations of two different oligosaccharide ligands of IL-6 were studied (see “Results”): the N-glycan glycoprotein ligand found on P0 and MAG and the higher affinity ligand of the eggs of R. temporaria oligosaccharide alditol. For these two molecules, the random search technique was used as implemented in the Sybyl version 6.6 software to sample the conformational space (Tripos, Inc., St. Louis, MO (www.tripos.com)). The OPLS All-Atom Force Field (56.Damm W.A. Frontera A. Tirado-Rives J. Jorgensen W.L. J. Comp. Chem. 1997; 18: 1955-1970Crossref Scopus (614) Google Scholar) was used except for the sulfated monosaccharide (3-sulfated GlcA) for which a charge determination was performed using quantum chemical procedures available in the Jaguar software (Jaguar Version 4.0; Schrödinger, Inc., Portland, OR 97204 (www.schrodinger.com)). The Density Functional Theory was used with the B3LYP hybrid method and the 6-31G basis set. The molecular electrostatic potential was computed on a spherical grid and fit to a set of point charges located at the atomic centers. The fit was constrained to also reproduce the dipole moment. Fourteen torsional angles of rotatable bonds were changed for the glycoprotein ligand (compound IV in Fig. 1B), 14 and 17 for compounds I and II, respectively, which consist of the glycosidic linkages and the CH2OH, NHCOCH3, COOH, and SO3 groups. In both cases, 20,000,000 configurations were examined using the bump checking (with a Van der Waals scaling factor of 0.7) and energy as criteria. For compound IV, 40311 conformers were found, among which the 10 of lowest energy (in a 6 kcal/mol range) were retained for docking with human IL-6). For compound II only 149 conformers were found due to its low flexibility as compared with compound IV. Again the 10 lowest in energy were kept for docking (in a 10 kcal/mol range). The docking with IL-6 was performed using the SO42− sulfate group found in the crystal as a template (9.Somers W. Stahl M. Seehra J.S. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 989-997Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). A random search was performed after replacing the corresponding sulfate in the IL-6 crystal by the oligosaccharide-bound sulfate group. No new conformers were found. To examine the function of the lectin activity of IL-6 for glycans having the HNK-1 epitope, a population of quiescent human lymphocyte was incubated with IL-6 for 15 min at 37 °C, and the phosphorylation pattern was analyzed using anti-phosphotyrosine, anti-phosphoserine, and anti-phosphothreonine monoclonal antibodies. As shown in Fig. 1A, lane 2, the IL-6-treated material showed a significant decrease of phosphotyrosine residues of tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins of Mr 77,000, 73,000, 69,000, 60,000, and 56,000, respectively, whereas not significant variations were observed using the two other antibodies (not shown). When the samples containing IL-6 were co-incubated with IL-6 ligands isolated from the mucins of the eggs of R. temporaria (Fig. 1B), the decrease in tyrosine phosphorylation was suppressed, and the profile of the tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins was identical to the profiles of untreated cells (Fig. 1A, lanes 3 and 4). This indicated that, at low concentrations (1 ng/ml for compound II, i.e. ∼1 nm and 0.8 μg/ml, i.e. ∼1 μm for compoundI), the IL-6 oligosaccharide ligands were able to inhibit the earliest dephosphorylations already observed (57.Zafriri D. Argaman M. Canaani E. Kimchi A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 477-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar) in the IL-6-dependent signaling. In contrast, compoundIII was ineffective at the concentration of 10 μm. The previous data suggested that the lectin activity of IL-6 was of fundamental importance for the IL-6-dependent association between IL-6Rα and its signal-transducing molecule gp130. Therefore it was necessary to determine whether the HNK-1 epitope was present in molecules of the gp130 surface complex, especially on gp130. This point was analyzed in the following way. Resting human lymphocytes (not supplemented with IL-6) were lysed in a mild detergent (55.Hatakeyama M. Kono T. Kobayashi N. Kawahara A. Levin S.D. Perlmutter R.M. Taniguchi T. Science. 1991; 252: 1523-1528Crossref PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar), supplemented with a stronger detergent mixture (known to dissociate surface molecular complexes (55.Hatakeyama M. Kono T. Kobayashi N. Kawahara A. Levin S.D. Perlmutter R.M. Taniguchi T. Science. 1991; 252: 1523-1528Crossref PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar)), and then immunoprecipitated using a serum from a human patient with IgM paraproteinemia (43.Fredman P. Lycke J. Andersen O. Vrethem M. Ernerudh J. Svennerholm L. J. Neurol. 1993; 240: 381-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The immunoprecipitated material was submitted to SDS-PAGE, blotted on nitrocellulose, and the blots were revealed using a mouse monoclonal anti-gp130 antibody followed by an AKP-labeled anti-mouse IgG antibody. As shown in Fig. 2B, the anti-HNK-1 immunoprecipitate actually contained a high Mr band of 131,000 specifically revealed using the anti-gp130 antibody. This demonstrated that at least one of the molecules bearing the HNK-1 epitope in the gp130 molecular complex was gp130 itself. In fact, silver staining of the SDS gels performed in reducing conditions of the immunoprecipitated material indicated that the number of subunits (besides heavy and light chains of IgM) was extremely reduced. Indeed, four protein bands were detected with Mr of 57,000 63,000, 85,000 and 130,000, respectively (Fig. 2D). The latter, migrating as gp130, was the more abundant of the subunits immunoprecipitated using the patient serum. These data were totally different from those obtained with the HepG2 cell line (Fig. 2C), in which more than 20 protein subunits were immunoprecipitated, all being expressed at a higher level when expressed per mg of total cell protein. The previous experiments demonstrated that: (i) the lectin activity of IL-6 was essential for its biological function; (ii) this function was the extracellular association between the IL-6Rα complex and the gp130-containing complex, HNK-1-containing glycan being present on gp130 itself. Therefore, it was of interest to make a theoretical model of the interaction between IL-6 and its ligands. The compound II isolated from R. temporaria egg mucins was the higher affinity ligand so far identified. Consequently, it was considered as the reference structure for the determination of the conformation of IL-6 oligosaccharide ligands. Because IL-6 bound to the P0 and MAG glycoproteins possessing the HNK-1 epitope on specific N-glycans of known structures (24.Voshol H. Vanzuylen W.E.M. Orberger G. Vliegenthart J.F.G. Schachner M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22957-22960Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar), the extended HNK-1 part of this compound (compound IV in Fig. 1B) was taken as the putative endogenous glycoprotein ligand of IL-6. Based on studies (17.Cebo C. Dambrouck T. Maes E. Laden C. Strecker G. Michalski J.C. Zanetta J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 5685-5691Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) of different O-glycans isolated from the eggs of Rana arvalis (49.Coppin A. Maes E. Flahaut C. Coddeville B. Strecker G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 266: 370-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) and of R. temporaria (45.Florea D. Maes E. Strecker G. Carbohydr. Res. 1997; 302: 179-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), it was clear that the 3-O-SO3H group on GlcA was a fundamental determinant of the interaction between IL-6 and its ligand. The presence of an additional residue (Gal and/or more complex sequences) on the Galβ1,4 of compound II (compoundIII in Fig. 1B) strongly suppressed the affinity for IL-6. The same was observed when the Galβ1,4 of compoundII was replaced by a Galβ1,3. The absence of the Fucα1,2 residue linked to the Galβ1,3 of compound II (compoundI) decreased the affinity by a factor of about 103. Therefore, it was suggested that these two compounds possessed in common a special conformation allowing the specific interaction with a domain of IL-6. One possibility was that, beside the common nonreducing carbohydrate sequence SO3H-3-GlcAβ1,3Galβ1-, these compounds had a hydrophobic residue (methyl group of Fuc and acetamido group of GlcNAc, respectively) increasing the affinity for IL-6. Consequently, two key structures were chosen for computational conformational analysis: compound II and the compound IV reduced to the Manα1,6 branch (Fig. 1B). The representations of the lower energy conformations of the R. temporaria ligand, compound II (Fig. 3), showed that they corresponded to very rigid structures. The conformation shown in Fig. 3A was significantly different from all other conformations, since its energy was 7 kCal/mol lower than the other lower energy conformation shown in Fig. 3B. It presented a very rigid and compact tripod-like structure, contrasting with the other low energy conformation showing a more extended structure. The glucuronic acid 3-sulfate motif was rotated by about 90° relative to the previous compound, whereas the acetamido group of GalNAc-ol was rotated by 180° relative to the previous compound. The two lowest energy conformations of the glycoprotein HNK-1 epitope (portion of compound IV) were found to be very similar (Fig. 3, C and D) and presented very close energetic levels. These two structures presented a great similarity with the lowest energy conformer of R. temporaria for the motif SO3H-3-GlcAβ1,3Galβ1-. This was evidenced in Fig. 4, where these groups were placed in similar positions. Interestingly, in all these compounds, the methyl groups were in opposition to the sulfate group and at different distances from the sulfate group in the R. temporaria and in the glycoprotein ligand of IL-6. This suggested that the hydrophobic residues were not involved directly in the binding to IL-6. Rather, these experiments suggested that the important domain for the interaction with IL-6 was the conformation of the SO3H-3-GlcAβ1,3Galβ1 motif. This was perfectly compatible with the fact that the addition of a residue of Galβ on the hydroxyl in position 4 of Gal inhibited the interaction with IL-6. It might be also understood why that the absence of the Fuc residue in compound II (compound I) dramatically decreased the binding of IL-6, modifying the conformation of the SO3H-3-GlcAβ1,3Galβ1 motif of interaction with IL-6. Indeed, the lower energy conformers of compound I showed different conformations as compared with those of compoundsII and IV. Especially, the Gal residue vic"

In particular, it is not clear whether delivery of membrane proteins to the secretory lysosome requires lysosomal, secretory granule, or some novel targeting determinants. Heterologous expression of P-selectin has established that this membrane protein contains targeting signals for both secretory granules and lysosomes. P-selectin is therefore an ideal probe with which to determine the signals required for targeting to secretory lysosomes. We have exploited subcellular fractionation and immunofluorescence microscopy to monitor targeting of transiently expressed wild-type and mutant horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-P-selectin chimeras to secretory lysosomes of Rbl-2H3 cells. The exposure of the HRP chimeras to intracellular proteolysis was also determined as a third monitor of secretory lysosome targeting.

Not only does this organelle serve as the final degradative compartment of the cell, but it also stores secretory molecules that are released in response to an extracellular trigger. This exocytic capacity clearly marks them from conventional lysosomes. Although conventional lysosomes can also fuse with the plasma membrane and release their soluble contents following stimulation (1Andrews N. Trends Cell Biol. 2000; 10: 316-321Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar), the extent of Ca2+-triggered secretion of lysosomal enzymes from cells such as fibroblasts and epithelial cells tends to be only 10–20% (2Rodriguez A. Webster P. Ortego J. Andrews N. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 93-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar). In comparison, up to 80% of lysosomal markers are released upon a physiological trigger from cells that possess secretory lysosomes. Cells such as cytotoxic T lymphocytes, neutrophils, melanocytes, mast cells, and basophils use their secretory lysosomes to store specialized components such as granzymes, melanin, histamine, and serotonin, in addition to their usual lysosomal content (3Dell'Angelica E.C. Mullins C. Caplan S. Bonifacino J.S. FASEB J. 2000; 14: 1265-1278Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 4Stinchcombe J.C. Griffiths G.M. J.

Rbl-2H3 is a basophilic leukemia cell line that has been extensively used in studies of regulated exocytosis. Morphological and biochemical studies have revealed that Rbl-2H3 secretory granules possess an acidic pH, contain mature lysosomal enzymes, and are accessible to endocytic markers, all hallmarks of lysosomes, but they also contain secretory markers such as serotonin. Both “lysosomal” and “granule” markers can be released upon stimulation of the cells by aggregation of FcεRI (6Dragonetti A. Baldassarre M. Castino R. Demoz M. Luini A. Buccione R. Isidoro C. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 3289-3298Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7Xu K. Williams R.M. Holowka D. Baird B. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 2385-2396Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus the endocytic and exocytic apparatus are linked such that the lysosome has been modified to become the regulated secretory organelle of these cells. Given the hybrid nature of the secretory lysosome, an interesting question is which cytoplasmic targeting signals (in this paper we define a targeting signal as a peptide sequence that is required for the accumulation of a protein within an organelle) direct membrane proteins to this organelle. The simplest possibility is that lysosomal targeting sequences operate to direct both lysosomal and secretory membrane proteins to the modified lysosome (3Dell'Angelica E.C. Mullins C. Caplan S. Bonifacino J.S. FASEB J. 2000; 14: 1265-1278Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Alternatively, secretory granule or entirely novel targeting signals that are specific to secretory lysosomes might be used. When tyrosinase, the resident membrane protein of melanosomes is heterologously expressed in HeLa and Madin-Darby canine kidney cells, it localizes to lysosomes in a di-leucine signal-dependent manner (8Calvo P.A. Frank D.W. Bieler B.M. Berson J.F. Marks M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12780-12789Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 9Simmen T. Schmidt A. Hunziker W. Beermann F. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 45-53PubMed Google Scholar). In addition this di-leucine signal mediates targeting of tyrosinase to synaptic like microvesicles (SLMV)1 from the endocytic pathway of PC12 cells (10Blagoveshchenskaya A.D. Hewitt E.W. Cutler D.F.

Thus tyrosinase appears to possess the necessary sorting information for its localization to secretory lysosomes, conventional lysosomes, and SLMV. In contrast, it has been suggested that Fas ligand is sorted to the secretory lysosome of cytotoxic T lymphocytes using novel signals in its cytoplasmic tail, specific to this class of organelle, because when heterologously expressed, Fas ligand localizes only to secretory lysosomes (Rbl-2H3 cells) but not to conventional lysosomes (HeLa cells) (11Bossi G. Griffiths G.M. Nat. Med. 1999; 5: 90-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). P-selectin resides in the membranes of α and δ granules of platelets (12Berman C.L. Yeo E.L. Wencel-Drake J.D.

The short, 35-amino acid cytoplasmic tail of P-selectin is necessary for targeting to WPB, but surprisingly, deletion of this region does not affect sorting to the secretory lysosomal α granules of platelets (18Hartwell D.W. Mayadas T.N. Berger G. Frenette P.S. Rayburn H. Hynes R.O. Wagner D.D. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1129-1141Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Importantly, heterologous expression of P-selectin has allowed for the definition of both granule and lysosomal targeting signals, as well as those for delivery to SLMV, in a variety of cell types (Fig.1). It is therefore an ideal candidate to investigate the following two questions: first, is the cytoplasmic tail of P-selectin sufficient for delivery to secretory lysosomes of Rbl-2H3 cells, and second, if so, then does delivery rely on granule, lysosomal, or novel targeting signals? We have combined subcellular fractionation coupled to transient transfection of HRP-P-selectin chimeras in Rbl-2H3 cells to answer these questions. Micro-BCA Protein Assay Reagent kit was used according to the manufacturer's instructions (Pierce). [3H]Serotonin (hydroxytryptamine binoxylate-5), specific activity 28 Ci/mm, was purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences.125I-Diferric transferrin (human), specific activity 60 Ci/mm, was purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. TSA Fluorescence Systems (cyanine 3) was purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. All chemicals were purchased from Sigma, unless otherwise stated. HRP-P-selectin is a chimera comprising the human growth hormone signal sequence, followed by horseradish peroxidase (HRP) and the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains of P-selectin in pRK34 (18Hartwell D.W.

Rbl-2H3 cells (kind gift from Mark Marsh, MRC Unit, LMCB, University College London) were grown as an adherent monolayer in DMEM (Life Technologies, Inc.), supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 50 μg/ml Gentamicin (Life Technologies, Inc.), at 37 °C, 5% CO2. For transient transfection studies, ∼4 × 107 cells were electroporated (three pulses) at 125 microfarads, 250 V, infinity ohms. For wt, YGVF,DPSPHRP-P-selectin constructs, 10 μg of DNA was used for transfection, whereas 3 μg of DNA was used for KCPL,763HRP-P-selectin constructs to obtain similar levels of expression. Cells were replated in their usual growth medium and analyzed 3 days post-transfection. Cells were primed overnight (day 2 post-transfection) with 0.5 μg/ml anti-2,4-dinitrophenol IgE (monoclonal, SPE-7, Sigma) and also incubated with 0.2 μCi/ml [3H]serotonin (hydroxytryptamine binoxylate-5, PerkinElmer Life Sciences) in growth medium prior to stimulation the following day. Cells were rinsed twice and cultured for 1 h in normal media. Stimulation was induced by the addition of 50 ng/ml human serum albumin/2,4-dinitrophenol to cross-link the IgE bound to FcεRI on the cell surface for 25 min at 37 °C. This took place in DMEM (without serum, 10 mm HEPES, 2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin) with no phenol red (to prevent interference of absorbance assays for β-hexosaminidase). Cells were then placed on ice, and the stimulation medium was removed and kept for analysis. Three days post-transfection, cells were serum-starved (DMEM, 10 mmHEPES, 2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin) for 1 h and incubated with 0.6 μCi/ml 125I-transferrin for 1 h. Cells were then rinsed three times in cold DMEM. To locate the plasma membrane, cell surface 125I-transferrin was stripped by the following method. Following loading with 125I-transferrin, cells were transferred to ice, rinsed, and incubated for 15 min in 20 mm sodium acetate, pH 5, 2 mmCaCl2, 150 mm NaCl, and 50 μmdeferoxamine mesylate. This was replaced with PBS+ (PBS, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm CaCl2) and then further rinsed and incubated for 20 min with PBS+ and 50 μm deferoxamine mesylate. Single sucrose gradient subcellular fractionation was performed according to a procedure modified from that published by Baram et al. (27Baram D. Adachi R. Medalia O. Tuvim M. Dickey B.F. Mekori Y.A. Sagi-Eisenberg R. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 189: 1649-1657Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Cells were placed on ice and rinsed twice with homogenization buffer (HB, pH 7.3, 0.25 m sucrose, 1 mm MgCl2, 10 mm HEPES). Samples were scraped (4 × 107) in 1.5-ml volume of HB (plus 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and protease inhibitor mixture). The cell suspension was homogenized by five passages through a ball bearing homogenizer with 0.009 mm clearance (EMBL, Heidelberg, Germany). The nuclear fraction was spun down at 170 × g for 10 min at 4 °C and 800 units/ml DNase (type IV) added to the post-nuclear supernatant (PNS). The PNS was loaded onto a preformed continuous sucrose gradient as described (27Baram D. Adachi R. Medalia O. Tuvim M. Dickey B.F. Mekori Y.A. Sagi-Eisenberg R. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 189: 1649-1657Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Gradients were collected in 25 fractions of 500 μl from the top of the tube using an Autodensi-Flow IIC (Buchler Instruments, Kansas City, MO) and analyzed when necessary for [3H]serotonin, 125I-transferrin, β-hexosaminidase, and HRP activities across the gradient. Recovery of β-hexosaminidase and HRP activities on the primary gradient was ∼50% of total activity (homogenate + medium) in resting cells; however, for stimulated cells, recovery was reduced to around 40% of total activity. For experiments that required a further secondary gradient, fractions 14–20 were analyzed and the remainder pooled to 4 ml at 1.1 m sucrose. The pooled fractions were layered onto a preformed continuous sucrose gradient of 1.3–2.0 msucrose (8 ml). This gradient was then run, fractionated, and analyzed as with the first gradient. [3H]Serotonin incorporation was monitored by tritium radioactivity using liquid scintillation spectrometry. 125I-Transferrin loading was monitored by gamma counting using a Packard Cobra II auto-gamma counter. β-Hexosaminidase activity was determined using an absorbance assay in a microplate reader as follows. 50 μl of sample was mixed with 20 μl of subcellular fractionation buffer (1 mmNaHCO3, 1 mm EDTA, 0.01% Triton X-100). This was then incubated with 100 μl of substrate solution consisting of 4 mg/mlp-nitrophenyl-N-acetyl-β-d-glucosaminide in 0.1 m sodium citrate buffer, (pH 4.5, 0.2% Triton X-100) for 30 min at 37 °C in the dark. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 150 μl of pre-warmed (37 °C) stop buffer (0.25m glycine, 0.2 m NaCl, 4% SDS, pH 12.5). The samples were read at 405 nm in a Molecular Devices Thermo.max microplate reader. HRP activities were determined from aliquots of 75 μl as described previously (28Blagoveshchenskaya A.D. Cutler D.F. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 327: 45-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Transfected cells on glass coverslips 1 day post-transfection were paraformaldehyde (3%)-fixed, quenched with 50 mm NH4Cl, and rinsed with PBS. Coverslips were then placed in cyanine 3-tyramide signal amplification (TSA) reagent for 10 min. The reaction was stopped with 8 washes in PBS plus azide (0.2%). Samples were permeabilized in 0.2% saponin and then transferred to PBS plus 0.02% saponin and 0.2% gelatin for subsequent antibody incubations. Cells were incubated with mouse monoclonal anti-serotonin (Biogenesis, Poole, UK), followed by goat anti-mouse fluorescein isothiocyanate (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, West Grove, PA). After staining, cells were mounted in Mowiol and analyzed with the use of an Optiphot-2 microscope (Nikon, Tokyo, Japan) equipped with an MRC Bio-Rad 1024 confocal laser scanning system. Images were transferred to Adobe Photoshop (Adobe Systems, Mountain View, CA). The partitioning of membrane-associated HRP and soluble (clipped) HRP (28Blagoveshchenskaya A.D. Cutler D.F. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 327: 45-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar) was established using the Triton X-114 assay (29Masterton W.J. Magee A.I. Magee A.I. Wileman T. Protein Targeting, A Practical Approach. Oxford University Press, New York1992: 242Google Scholar) with the addition of a protease inhibitor mixture upon cell lysis. Transfected and mock-transfected cells were separated into upper and lower phases, and HRP assays were carried out in triplicate. To normalize for differential cell number between samples, the protein concentration (Micro BCA Protein Assay Reagent kit, Pierce) of each phase was determined. For transfected and mock-transfected cells, the HRP activity in each phase (upper or lower) was calculated per μg of total protein (upper plus lower). Levels of HRP activity/μg of protein in the two phases of mock-transfected cells was used to subtract background levels of endogenous peroxidase activity away from transfected cells. The extent of proteolysis of HRP from its P-selectin membrane-bound anchor was established by calculating the percentage of soluble (clipped) HRP in the upper phase to the total of both phases. To determine which targeting signals are required by HRP-P-selectin for accumulation within Rbl-2H3 secretory lysosomes, we combined transient expression with subcellular fractionation, a strategy that has proved highly successful in previous analyses of targeting (21Norcott J.P.

Because morphological co-localization of Rbl-2H3 endogenous markers such as the granule membrane protein 5G10 (30Bonifacino J.S. Yuan L. Sandoval I.V. J. Cell Sci. 1989; 92: 701-712PubMed Google Scholar), serotonin, lgp120, and β-hexosaminidase has been reported within a single population of organelles (6Dragonetti A. Baldassarre M. Castino R.

Cell. 2001; 106: 395-398Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), we expected to find a single peak containing these markers by fractionation. We have chosen two markers for the secretory lysosome, the lysosomal enzyme β-hexosaminidase and the secretory monoamine serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine), to reflect the twin characteristics of the organelle. We assayed for endogenous activity of β-hexosaminidase and labeled cells with [3H]serotonin. We first established that the uptake of [3H]serotonin was specific by using reserpine, which blocks the vesicular uptake of catecholamines and serotonin (data not shown). Fig.2 A shows the subcellular distribution of the secretory lysosome marker β-hexosaminidase across a single sucrose gradient following centrifugation of the PNS from resting and cells stimulated by cross-linking the IgE receptor (FcεRI) for 25 min. The lysosomal enzyme β-hexosaminidase distributes as a single peak of activity, highlighted in gray (fractions 14–20), and activity falls from this peak by 45% upon stimulation. This fractionation scheme was adapted from the work of Baram et al. (27Baram D. Adachi R. Medalia O. Tuvim M. Dickey B.F. Mekori Y.A. Sagi-Eisenberg R. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 189: 1649-1657Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), who enriched for secretory lysosomes from Rbl cells using this single sucrose gradient. We have observed the secretory marker [3H]serotonin to always co-distribute with β-hexosaminidase across the gradient in resting cells and to respond to stimulation in the same way as β-hexosaminidase in all experiments carried out to date. [3H]Serotonin, however, was not monitored at this early stage to retain material for subsequent analysis. These same resting and stimulated cells had been transiently transfected 3 days prior with wt HRP-P-selectin (21Norcott J.P. Solari R. Cutler D.F. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 1229-1240Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) to determine whether the cytoplasmic domain of P-selectin has the necessary sorting information required to direct it to the secretory lysosome of these cells. Fig. 2 Bshows that wt HRP-P-selectin peaks in the same fractions (15Bonfanti R. Furie B.C. Furie B. Wagner D.D. Blood. 1989; 73: 1109-1112Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16McEver R.P. Beckstead J.H.

Thus HRP-P-selectin is targeted to the functionally active secretory lysosome. A more detailed stimulation profile was carried out by inducing exocytosis for 5 and 10 min to ascertain whether a significant proportion of HRP-P-selectin would shift out of the secretory lysosome peak into other organellar fractions, such as the plasma membrane, upon degranulation of the cells. HRP activity does appear as a shoulder to the main secretory lysosome peak from fractions 9–14, within which the HRP activity increases sequentially as we increase the stimulation period. However, the secretory lysosome peak remains the main peak of HRP activity. Following 5 min of stimulation, 29% HRP activity is lost from the secretory lysosome fractions (14Israels S.J. Gerrard Y.V.

J. 1998; 336: 153-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar); 10 min of stimulation results in a 35% fall, and after 25 min of stimulation there is a 38% fall in HRP activity from the secretory lysosome. This sequential loss of activity from the peak of the secretory lysosome upon stimulation coincides with the sequential increase in activity in fractions 9–14. Following the full 25-min stimulation period, we only observe a 38% fall in HRP activity within the secretory lysosome, whereas the extent of release of β-hexosaminidase following the same period was 45%. To investigate the residual HRP activity within the secretory lysosome peak, we pooled fractions 14–20 (highlighted) and layered them onto a more shallow secondary sucrose gradient (1.3–2.0 m). Fig.2 C shows the distribution of β-hexosaminidase and [3H]serotonin from the pooled fractions of Fig.2 A. The profile of the two markers in resting cells reveals two peaks, the lighter one distributing between fractions 9 and 10 and the denser one between fractions 17 and 20, both of which are responsive when the cells are induced to exocytose for 25 min. Hence both peaks are secretory lysosomes. The traces for resting and stimulated [3H]serotonin show a significant number of counts in the load of the gradient (fractions 1–5) which probably reflect leakage of this tracer molecule from vesicular structures. This is also observed when [3H]serotonin is monitored on the primary gradient (data not shown). Fig. 2 D shows that the resting peaks of HRP-P-selectin activity co-distribute with those for the secretory lysosome markers (2C) and that they also both respond to stimulation for 25 min, HRP activity falling from the secretory lysosome peaks and redistributing to a new lighter peak at fraction 8. This peak is not observed upon stimulation for the secretory lysosome markers β-hexosaminidase and [3H]serotonin (Fig.2 C). The clear fall in activity from both peaks of the secretory lysosome markers upon stimulation (2C) is not as obvious as the fall in HRP activity, because of the overlap of the peak at fraction 8 with the lighter one of the two secretory lysosome peaks (9Simmen T. Schmidt A. Hunziker W. Beermann F. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 45-53PubMed Google Scholar, 10Blagoveshchenskaya A.D. Hewitt E.W. Cutler D.F. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 3979-3990Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The shift of activity to fraction 8 is consecutive over time, HRP activity peaking at fraction 10 for resting and 5 min of stimulation, fraction 9 following 10 min and then to fraction 8 after 25 min of stimulation. This secondary gradient reveals that a large proportion of the residual HRP activity retained in the secretory lysosome peak following 25 min of stimulation in Fig. 2 B has moved to a separate compartment from the markers β-hexosaminidase and [3H]serotonin. In parallel, we quantified release of β-hexosaminidase and [3H]serotonin into the bathing medium. Fig. 2 Eshows that only 3.5% of both β-hexosaminidase and [3H]serotonin is constitutively secreted from resting cells, whereas 47% is released upon 25 min of stimulation. This 47% release is in good agreement with the 45% fall in β-hexosaminidase activity from the subcellular profile of the secretory lysosome in Fig.2 A. We compared the targeting of wt HRP-P-selectin to secretory lysosomes with that of tetra-alanine mutant chimeras of the cytoplasmic sequences KCPL, YGVF, and DPSP and of the deletion mutant 763HRP-P-selectin, which lacks all three motifs (Fig. 3). These three motifs have been implicated in lysosomal, secretory granule, and SLMV targeting (Fig. 1). Rbl cells were transiently transfected with wt,KCPL,YGVF,DPSP, 763HRP-P-selectin and cultured for 3 days. Fractionation was then carried out, and the subcellular profile across the primary sucrose gradient for each chimera is shown in Fig. 4 A.

However, much lower levels of HRP activity within the secretory lysosome peak are found with the mutants KCPL and 763HRP-P-selectin, which coincide with a significant accumulation of HRP activity elsewhere on the gradient. The profiles for 763HRP-P-selectin andKCPLHRP-P-selectin differ in that there is a significant shoulder to the major peak for 763HRP-P-selectin such that it covers fractions 6–15, whereas the peak forKCPLHRP-P-selectin is sharper (fractions 10–15). Mutating the sequence KCPL, which is implicated in lysosomal targeting (Fig. 1), to tetra-alanine has a similar effect on targeting to the secretory lysosome as the complete removal of the last 27 residues of the cytoplasmic domain.

Integration in this system is dependent upon the mini donor DNA having IN recognition sequences at both ends and the reaction products have all of the features associated with integration of viral DNA in vivo. Using this system, we explored the relationship between the HIV-1 U3 and U5 IN recognition sequences by analyzing substrates that contain either two U3 or two U5 terminal sequences. Both substrates caused severe defects to integration but with different effects on the mechanism indicating that the U3 and the U5 sequences are both required for concerted DNA integration. We have also used the reconstituted system to compare the mechanism of integration catalyzed by HIV-1 to that of avian sarcoma virus by analyzing the effect of defined mutations introduced into U3 or U5 ends of the respective wild type DNA substrates. Despite sequence differences between avian sarcoma virus and HIV-1 IN and their recognition sequences, the consequences of analogous base pair substitutions at the same relative positions of the respective IN recognition sequences were very similar.

Leis J. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1999; 63: 836-843Crossref PubMed Google Scholar for a review). Cell proteins belonging to the HMG-I(Y) family stimulate the reaction (2.Farnet C.M. Bushman F.D.

Virol. 1999; 73: 2994-3003Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The sites of integration are widely distributed in the target DNA. Short duplications of the cell DNA are introduced at the insertion site, the size of which is dictated by IN. For HIV-1 and ASV the size of the duplications are five and six base pairs, respectively.

These viral DNA end sequences correspond to the nearly perfect inverted repeats that define the relationships between the U3 and U5 RNA ends. The inverted repeat for RSV is 12 of 15, while that for HIV-1 is 12 of 20. A comparison of the RSV and HIV-1 IN recognition sequences indicates that they are unique. The only common feature is the presence of a conserved CA dinucleotide at positions 3 and 4 from the terminus. Short oligodeoxynucleotide duplexes representing the ends of HIV-1 U5 LTR are more efficient substrates for IN processing (12.Bushman F.D. Craigie R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

In the case of ASV IN, the U3 LTR end is preferred over the U5 LTR end (7.Fitzgerald M.L. Vora A.C. Zeh W.G. Grandgenett D.P. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 6257-6263Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9.Vora A.C.

Biochem. 1991; 196: 19-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). It has also been observed that mutations at the viral U3 LTR end have different effects than those at the U5 end. U3 mutations in ASV reduce integration rate to a greater extent than comparable mutations in U5 (5.Hindmarsh P. Johnson M. Reeves R. Leis J. J.

Also, regions critical for integration are very close to the ends of the LTRs, adjacent to and including the conserved CA dinucleotide (5.Hindmarsh P. Johnson M. Reeves R. Leis J. J.

Alteration of these sequences results in retroviral strains deficient in integration. Assays that utilize oligodeoxynucleotide duplexes that represent either U3 or U5 HIV-1 LTR ends have also demonstrated the importance of positions 3–6 to the efficiency of the processing reaction (14.Sherman P.A. Dickson M.L. Fyfe J.A. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 3593-3601Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19.Esposito D. Craigie R. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5832-5843Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). While an individual LTR end serves as an IN substrate, interactions between IN and both LTR ends determines the mechanism and efficiency of integration in vivo. Therefore, it is important to analyze the effect of mutations in the IN recognition sequences using substrates that contain both LTR termini and are capable of concerted DNA integration. We have used the HIV-1 reconstituted integration system to analyze donor DNAs that contain only U5 or only U3 LTR IN recognition sequences at both ends. Both substrates caused severe defects to integration but with different effects on the mechanism. In addition, a series of mutations were introduced either into the U5 or the U3 HIV-1 IN recognition sequence into and adjacent to the conserved CA dinucleotide of wild type donors. Taken together, these analyses indicated that IN-catalyzed concerted DNA integration requires both U3 and U5 IN recognition sequences in a donor. [α-32P]dCTP (3000 Ci/mmol) was purchased from Amersham Biosciences, Inc. Proteinase K (30 units/mg) and glycogen were from Roche Molecular Biochemicals (Indianapolis, IN). HMG-I(Y) was purified as described by Nissen et al. (21.Nissen M.S. Langan T.A. Reeves R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19945-19952Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Vent DNA polymerase (2 units/μl) was from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA). Oligodeoxyribonucleotides were purchased from Operon (Alameda, CA) and purified by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under denaturing conditions. The following oligodeoxyribonucleotides were used in this study: U5(WT), 5′-ACTGCTAGAGATTTTCCACACTGGGCGGAGCCTATG-3′; U5 5GA6, 5′-ACTGGAAGAGATTTTCCACACTGGGCGGAGCCTATG-3′; U5 4CGAT7, 5′-ACTCGATGAGATTTTCCACACTGGGCGGAGCCTATG-3′; U5 3AC4, 5′-ACCCCTAGAGATTTTCCACACTGGGCGGAGCCTATG-3′; U5 del, 5′-CTCATGCACTGCGCGTACACCTGGGCGGAGCCTATG-3′; U5 for U3, 5′-ACTGCTAGAGATTTTCCACACGTTGCCCGGATCCGG-3′; U3(WT), 5′-ACTGGAAGGGCTAATTCACTCGTTGCCCGGATCCGG-3′; U3 5CT6, 5′-ACTGCTAGGGCTAATTCACTCGTTGCCCGGATCCGG-3′; U3 4CCTT7, 5′-ACTCCTTGGGCTAATTCACTCGTTGCCCGGATCCGG-3′; U3 3AC4, 5′-ACACGAAGGGCTAATTCACTCGTTGCCCGGATCCGG-3′; U3 del, 5′-CTCATGCACTGCGCGTACACCGTTGCCCGGATCCGG-3′; U3 for U5, 5′-ACTGGAAGGGCTAATTCACTCTGGGCGGAGCCTATG-3′; U5seq, 5′-AGAATTCGGCGTTGCTGGCGTTTTTCCATA-3′; U3seq, 5′-CTGCCGTCATCGACTTCGAAGGTTCGAATC-3′. The U5 3AC4, U5 5GA6, U5 4CGAT7, and U3 for U5 oligodeoxyribonucleotides were used to prepare HIV-1 donor-concerted DNA integration substrates with mutations in the U5 terminus sequence. In each case, the sequence refers to the 3′-cleaved strand of the U5 LTR IN recognition sequence. The U3 5CT6, 3AC4, 4CCTT7, and U5 for U3 oligodeoxynucleotides were used to prepare comparable donor DNAs with mutations in the U3 IN recognition sequence. The U5seq and U3seq oligodeoxyribonucleotides were used as sequencing primers. The U3seq primer is complementary to plasmid πvx nucleotides 180–151, and the U5seq primer is complementary to plasmid πvx nucleotides 312–341. Escherichia coli DH5α (Invitrogen) and MC1061/P3 (Invitrogen) strains were used for these studies. MC1061/P3 is a derivative of MC1061 containing the male episome, P3, which can be selected for the presence of an encoded Kanr gene. In addition, P3 possesses amp (Am) and tet (f Am) genes, the expression of which can be rescued by the supF amber suppressor tRNA. Under these conditions, MC1061/P3 can be selected for ampicillin, tetracycline, and kanamycin resistance. Plasmid pHHIV2 was used in this study as a template to amplify donor DNA and is a variation of pBCSK+ in which a wild type HIV-1 donor DNA PCR product was inserted into pBCSK+ catalyzed by IN, resulting in the loss of two base pairs from the LTR ends. This plasmid was propagated in E. coli MC1061/P3 under the conditions described above. The integration acceptor was plasmid pBCSK+ (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA), which was propagated in E. coli DH5α. Plasmids were purified with Qiaprep columns (Qiagen, Chatsworth, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The growth of DH5α containing pBCSK+ was selected for by addition of chloramphenicol (35 μg/ml). Integration donors were amplified by using thermostable Vent DNA polymerase and the primers listed above. Twenty-five pmol of each primer and 50 ng of pHHIV2 DNA, as the template, were used for each PCR reaction. Vent DNA polymerase was used according to the manufacturer's instructions. A total of 20 rounds of amplification were performed in each reaction. The amplification conditions were 94 °C for 2 min, 50 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 1 min for three rounds. This was followed by amplification conditions that used 94 °C for 2 min, 57 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 45 s for 17 additional rounds. The resultant product donor DNA was isolated after electrophoresis through 2% agarose gels equilibrated with 0.5× Tris borate-EDTA (3.Hindmarsh P. Ridky T. Reeves R. Andrake M. Skalka A.M. Leis J. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 2994-3003Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The purified DNA (600 ng) was recovered using QIAquick gel extraction kit (Qiagen). The integration donors were ∼300 base pairs in length and were internally labeled during the PCR by the inclusion of [α-32P]dCTP (3000 Ci/mmol, 10 mCi/ml). The final concentrations of deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates during amplification reactions were 0.25 mm each of unlabeled dATP, dGTP, and dTTP. The final dCTP concentration was 0.0502 mm (12 Ci/mmol, 0.6 mCi/ml). The concerted integration reaction conditions were similar to those described by Hindmarsh et al. (3.Hindmarsh P. Ridky T. Reeves R. Andrake M. Skalka A.M. Leis J. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 2994-3003Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, 15 ng (0.15 pmol of ends) of donor DNA was mixed with 50 ng of acceptor DNA (0.02 pmol) and 80 ng of HIV-1 IN (1.25 pmol) in a 8.5-μl preincubation reaction mixture containing, at final concentrations, 25 mm MOPS, pH 7.2, 23 mm NaCl, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 5% polyethylene glycol 8000, 10% dimethyl sulfoxide, 0.05% Nonidet P-40, 1% glycerol, 1.6 mm HEPES, pH 8.0, and 3.3 mmEDTA. The IN was diluted in a buffer containing 30% glycerol, 0.5m NaCl, 50 mm HEPES, pH 8.0, 1 mmdithiothreitol, and 0.1 mm EDTA. Where specified 100 ng of HMG-I(Y) was added to the reaction mixtures. The preincubation reaction mixtures were placed on ice overnight. The volume of each preincubation mixture was then increased to 10 μl with the addition of MgCl2 to a final concentration of 7.5 mm, and the integration assay mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 2 h. The reactions were stopped by increasing the volume to 150 μl by the addition of EDTA (final concentration of 4.25 mm), sodium dodecyl sulfate (final concentration of 0.44%), and proteinase K (final concentration of 0.06 mg/ml). After digestion for 60 min at 37 °C, the reaction mixtures were extracted with phenol followed by phenol-chloroform-isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1 mixture). Fifteen μl of 3m sodium acetate, pH 5.2, was added along with 1 μl of glycogen (10 mg/ml stock solution). The reaction products were precipitated by the addition of 450 μl of 100% ethanol and washed twice with 70% ethanol prior to electrophoresis and autoradiography. The reaction products were separated on a 1% agarose gel run in 0.5× Tris borate, EDTA, and ethidium bromide at 10 V/cm for 2 h. Following electrophoresis, gels were submerged in 5% trichloroacetic acid for 20 min or until the bromphenol blue dye turned bright yellow. After being washed with water, the gels were dried on DE-81 paper (Whatman) in a Bio-Rad slab gel dryer at 80 °C for ∼2 h under a vacuum. Quantitation of reaction products was carried out using a phosphorimaging device and ImageQuant 5.0 software. Experiments with wild-type donor integrants always accompanied experiments with mutant donor integrants as controls. All experiments were repeated at least two times. In all experiments, integration products were used directly for transformation of bacteria. The integration products were introduced into E. coliMCI061/P3 by electroporation, using a Bio-Rad electroporator with 0.1-cm electroporation cuvettes, 1.8-kV voltage, 25-μF capacitance, and 200-ohm resistance. The P3 episome is maintained at a low copy number. Therefore, only 40 μg/ml ampicillin, 15 μg/ml kanamycin, or 10 μg/ml tetracycline were required for selection. Under these conditions, we detected no colonies after supF selection when the donor, acceptor, or donor and acceptor were electroporated into cells in the absence of IN. Plasmid DNAs were recovered from individual clones, and integration junctions were sequenced by using primers U3seq (for sequencing the U3 junction) and U5seq (for sequencing the U5 junction). Sequencing was performed using the Thermo-Sequenase kit (U.S. Biochemical, Cleveland, Ohio). We used chi-square test to examine statistical significance of the difference between numbers of non-concerted events for different integration reactions. A binomial probability was used to determine significance of integration events into the same site in the target DNA. Since the total number of sequenced concerted integrants was 203 and the target plasmid length is 3400 base pairs, the formula used for calculations was the following:p = 203!/(x!(203-x)!)x(1–1/3400)(203-x), where x is a number of integration events into the same site. For calculation of probability of integration into a region we divided 3400 by the number of base pairs in the region. In the present study, we have used a reconstituted HIV-1 concerted DNA integration system that employs a specially designed mini donor DNA with HIV-1 U3 and U5 IN recognition sequences flanking a supF transcription unit (Fig. 1A), a supercoiled plasmid acceptor, purified bacterial-derived HIV-1 IN, and host HMG-I(Y) protein. The DNA integration products resulting from in vitro reactions have the characteristics associated with viral DNA integrated in vivo (3.Hindmarsh P. Ridky T. Reeves R. Andrake M. Skalka A.M. Leis J. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 2994-3003Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). When the products are analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis, integration is detected by the insertion of the small donor into the larger acceptor DNA (see Fig. 1B). As much as 15% of the wild type donor DNA was converted to RFII products so that the molar amount of integrated donor DNA is half that of the target DNA in the reaction. The integration intermediates that are present in the different bands are diagrammatically represented to the right of the gel. RFIII products form via a nucleophilic attack of two one-ended integration events into the same site on the target plasmid. Thereby the amount of RFIII product is dependent on the donor DNA efficiency as an integrase substrate. If the U5 end, which is more active in one-ended events, is changed to be a less efficient substrate for integrase, the amount of RFIII product would decrease parallel to that of RFII product. Among the RFII-like products are integration intermediates that represent one-ended and two-ended donor insertions into the acceptor. The presence of one-ended versus two-ended donor insertions can be distinguished when the products of a reaction are introduced into bacteria (see Fig. 1C). One-ended donor integration products are not maintained and are thereby lost. Two-ended DNA integration products can be recovered from individual colonies and sequenced to establish the junctions between donor and target DNA. Examination of these junction sequences distinguishes whether the two-ended insertion products were derived by a concerted or a non-concerted mechanism. For instance, for a wild type donor, ∼93% of the two-ended insertion events have characteristics associated with a concerted DNA integration mechanism (Table I). This includes the loss of two base pairs from the ends of the LTRs, wide distribution of insertion sites of the donor into acceptor DNAs, and five base pair duplications introduced at the site of insertion. Only a small percentage of the two-ended integrants occurred by a non-concerted mechanism detected by deletions rather than five base pair duplications introduced into the acceptor (Table I).Table ISites of DNA integration of a wild type donor DNA into an acceptorDNA integration products from the HIV-1 reconstituted integration system were introduced into bacteria, and individual clones were isolated and sequenced as described under “Experimental Procedures.”a.

We reexamined the effect of removing one of the two IN recognition sequences from the ends of the HIV-1 donor DNA. When the U5 IN recognition sequence was replaced by random sequence, the RFII-like product detected by gel electrophoresis decreased 89% compared with wild type (Fig. 2A, lanes 1 and 2). When the U3 IN recognition sequence was replaced by random sequence, the RFII-like product decreased only 10% compared with wild type (Fig. 3A, lane 3). As a control, when both IN recognition sequences were deleted, no integration into the acceptor DNA was detected on the gels (Fig. 3A, lane 2). When the products from the ΔU3 or ΔU5 reaction were introduced into bacteria, no colonies above the background level were obtained indicating that the removal of either of these IN recognition sequences resulted in the loss of two-ended DNA integration products (data not shown). The finding that there was very little decrease in the RFII-like products observed with the ΔU3 donor DNA indicates that the U5 IN recognition sequence efficiently promotes one-ended insertion events in the absence of a U3 IN recognition sequence.Figure 3Effect of substitutions in the HIV-1 U3 IN recognition sequence on integration in vitro.

We also analyzed the effect of substitution of the conserved CA dinucleotide at positions 3–4 (TAGCAGT → TAGGGGT). Integration reactions were carried out as described under “Experimental Procedures”, and products were analyzed first by agarose gel electrophoresis. Base pair substitutions introduced at positions 5–6 into the U5 LTR IN recognition sequence caused more than a 2-fold decrease of integration efficiency compared with wild type (Fig. 2A, lane 3). Substitutions at positions 4–7 and 3–4 resulted in more dramatic decreases of integration efficiency (Fig. 2A, lanes 4 and 5). Biological selection of integration products after their introduction in bacteria showed that when substitutions were made at positions 5–6 the number of two-ended integrants (judged by the number of recovered colonies) decreased to 40% that of a wild type donor (Fig. 2B). The number of selected double-ended integrants that resulted from reactions with donors containing substitutions at positions 4–7 and 3–4 was 5.7 and 3%, respectively, that of wild type (Fig. 2B). These decreases followed the percentage loss of integrants detected by the gel electrophoresis analysis (Fig. 2B). We further analyzed the products recovered from bacteria by sequencing individual integrants. In comparison to wild type, a donor with base pair inversions at positions 5–6 caused a 3-fold increase in non-concerted integration events, which introduced deletions rather than small duplications into the acceptor DNA (Table II). This is a statistically significant result as the probability of its happening is p = 0.04. Interestingly, the larger base pair inversions at positions 4–7, which includes positions 5–6, resembled wild type in that most integrants arose by a concerted mechanism (Fig. 2C, Table III).Table IISites of DNA integration of a HIV-1 donor DNA with base pair substitutions at U5–5GA6 positionsDNA integration products from the HIV-1 reconstituted integration system were introduced into bacteria, and individual clones were isolated and sequenced as described under “Experimental Procedures.”a.
