https://openalex.org/W2066180106,"The protein product of the human Duchenne muscular dystrophy locus (DMD) and its mouse homolog (mDMD) have been identified by using polyclonal antibodies directed against fusion proteins containing two distinct regions of the mDMD cDNA. The DMD protein is shown to be approximately 400 kd and to represent approximately 0.002% of total striated muscle protein. This protein is also detected in smooth muscle (stomach). Muscle tissue isolated from both DMD-affected boys and mdx mice contained no detectable DMD protein, suggesting that these genetic disorders are homologous. Since mdx mice present no obvious clinical abnormalities, the identification of the mdx mouse as an animal model for DMD has important implications with regard to the etiology of the lethal DMD phenotype. We have named the protein dystrophin because of its identification via the isolation of the Duchenne muscular dystrophy locus."

https://openalex.org/W2089126365,"Transcription factor Sp1 is a protein present in mammalian cells that binds to GC box promoter elements and selectively activates mRNA synthesis from genes that contain functional recognition sites. We have isolated a cDNA that encodes the 696 C-terminal amino acid residues of human Sp1. By expression of truncated fragments of Sp1 in E. coli, we have localized the DNA binding activity to the C-terminal 168 amino acid residues. In this region, Sp1 has three contiguous Zn(II) finger motifs, which are believed to be metalloprotein structures that interact with DNA. We have found that purified Sp1 requires Zn(II) for sequence-specific binding to DNA. Thus, it is likely that Sp1 interacts with DNA by binding of the Zn(II) fingers. To facilitate the identification of mutant variants of Sp1 that are defective in DNA binding, we have also devised a bacterial colony assay for detection of Sp1 binding to DNA."
https://openalex.org/W2058197513,"We have analyzed the de novo telomere synthesis catalyzed by the enzyme telomere terminal transferase (telomerase) from Tetrahymena. Oligonucleotides representing the G-rich strand of telomeric sequences from five different organisms specifically primed the addition of TTGGGG repeats in vitro, suggesting that primer recognition may involve a DNA structure unique to these oligonucleotides. The sequence at the 3' end of the oligonucleotide primer specified the first nucleotide added in the reaction. Furthermore, the telomerase was shown to be a ribonucleoprotein complex whose RNA and protein components were both essential for activity. After extensive purification of the enzyme by a series of five different chromatographic steps, a few small low abundance RNAs copurified with the activity."

https://openalex.org/W1996808398,"Chloroquine-resistant Plasmodium falciparum accumulate significantly less chloroquine than susceptible parasites, and this is thought to be the basis of their resistance. However, the reason for the lower accumulation of chloroquine was unknown. The resistant parasite has now been found to release chloroquine 40 to 50 times more rapidly than the susceptible parasite, although their initial rates of chloroquine accumulation are the same. Verapamil and two other calcium channel blockers, as well as vinblastine and daunomycin, each slowed the release and increased the accumulation of chloroquine by resistant (but not susceptible) Plasmodium falciparum. These results suggest that a higher rate of chloroquine release explains the lower chloroquine accumulation, and thus the resistance observed in resistant Plasmodium falciparum."

https://openalex.org/W1639259334,"The Saccharomyces cerevisiae gene PDR1, responsible for pleiotropic drug resistance, was isolated from a genomic DNA cosmid library by hybridization to the flanking LEU1 gene, followed by subcloning the drug-sensitive phenotype into the transformed pdr1-1, pdr1-2, and pdr1-3 drug-resistant mutants. A RNA molecule of 3.5 kilobases was identified as the PDR1 transcript. The nucleotide sequence of the complementing DNA fragment contained a 3192-nucleotide open reading frame. Disruption of the pdr1 and PDR1 genes restored or increased drug sensitivity. Analysis of the PDR1 deduced amino acid sequence revealed several homologies to four different regulatory proteins involved in the control of gene expression, including a cysteine-rich motif suggested to be a metal-binding domain for DNA recognition. A model is proposed of a general transcriptional control by PDR1 of several target genes encoding proteins from plasma, mitochondria, and possibly other permeability barriers."

https://openalex.org/W1608807138,"Peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase was extracted from pig kidney cortex and partially purified. Enzyme activity was monitored against the cis-trans isomerization of succinyl-Ala-Ala-Pro-Phe-methylcoumaryl amide by means of a two-step process using chymotrypsin as the trans cleaving activity. The in vitro refolding of denatured type III collagen, which is rate-limited by the cis-trans isomerization of peptide bonds, was studied in the presence of peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase by optical rotatory dispersion and by resistance to tryptic digestion. A 3-fold increase in the initial rate of folding was observed compared to the uncatalyzed refolding. This rate increase is comparable to the rate increase found for the CT-phase in the refolding of urea-denatured ribonuclease A, but it is smaller than the increase in the rate of isomerization of succinyl-Ala-Ala-Pro-Phe-methylcoumarylamide."

https://openalex.org/W1535209874,"DNA polymerase III holoenzyme was assembled from pure proteins onto a primer template scaffold. The assembly process could be divided into two stages. In the time-consuming first stage, beta subunit and gamma.delta subunit were required in forming a tightly bound ATP-activated complex with a single-stranded DNA bacteriophage circle uniquely primed with a synthetic pentadecadeoxyribonucleotide. This finding substantiates an earlier study using crude protein preparations in a homopolymer system lacking Escherichia coli single-stranded DNA binding protein (Wickner, S. (1976) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 73, 3511-3515). In the second stage, the polymerase III core and the tau subunit rapidly seek out and bind the preinitiation to form DNA polymerase III holoenzyme capable of rapid and entirely processive replication of the circular DNA. ATP is not required beyond formation of the preinitiation complex. It is remarkable that the fully assembled DNA polymerase III holoenzyme is so stably bound to the primed DNA circle (4-min half-time of dissociation), yet upon completing a round of synthesis the polymerase cycles within 10 s to a new preinitiation on a challenge primed DNA circle. Efficient polymerase cycling only occurred when challenge primed DNA was endowed with a preinitiation implying that cycling is mediated by a polymerase subassembly which dissociates from its accessory proteins and associates with a new preinitiation complex. These subunit dynamics suggest mechanisms for polymerase cycling on the lagging strand of replication forks in a growing chromosome."

https://openalex.org/W1554766158,"The ligand binding domain of the low density lipoprotein receptor consists of seven cysteine-rich repeats of approximately 40 amino acids each. These repeats, which are located at the NH2 terminus of the protein, are homologous to sequences in complement components C8 and C9. To determine the role of the first repeat (amino acids 2-42), we prepared two plasmids containing expressible low density lipoprotein receptor cDNAs. The first plasmid, p delta R1, lacks only the nucleotides encoding the first repeat. It produced a receptor that bound and internalized lipoproteins and recycled to the cell surface with the same efficiency as the normal receptor. This deleted receptor failed to bind two monoclonal antibodies, IgG-C7 and IgG-15C8, which were shown previously to react with the ligand-binding domain. The second plasmid, pR1, encodes a markedly truncated protein whose extracellular domain consists of the first repeat joined to the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains. This protein bound the two monoclonal antibodies with the same affinity as the normal receptor, but failed to bind lipoproteins. Binding of IgG-15C8 to the normal receptor and the pR1-encoded protein was Ca2+-dependent, indicating that the first repeat binds Ca2+. We conclude that repeats 2-6 in the ligand-binding domain are sufficient for binding lipoproteins and that the first repeat is highly immunogenic, but is not required for lipoprotein binding."
https://openalex.org/W2001244706,"The role of DNA topology in holding sister chromatids together before anaphase was investigated by analyzing the structure of a small circular minichromosome in cell cycle (cdc) mutants of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. In the majority of cells arrested after S phase but before anaphase, sister minichromosome molecules are not topologically interlocked with each other. The analysis of the ploidy of minichromosomes in cells that are released from arrest demonstrates that the sister molecules are properly segregated when the cell cycle block is removed. Therefore, sister minichromosome molecules need not remain topologically interlocked until anaphase in order to be properly segregated, and topological interlocking of sister DNA molecules apparently is not the primary force holding sister chromatids together."
https://openalex.org/W1606310877,"Secretory granule-enriched fractions prepared from isolated rat islets of Langerhans, previously labeled in culture for 18 h with [3H]leucine, have been lysed and separated into pH 5.4 soluble and insoluble fractions by zonal sucrose gradient centrifugation. A high proportion of both labeled and immunoreactive rat insulins I and II were recovered in the insoluble granule core fraction in the expected ratio of approximately 60/40, respectively. Essentially equivalent amounts of the rat C-peptides on a molar basis were recovered in the granule supernatant fractions. The proportion of labeled proinsulin in the granule core fraction was less than 2% relative to insulin, while the soluble fraction contained about 8%, which probably arose mainly from disrupted proinsulin-rich noncrystalline prosecretory vesicles. Electron microscopic examination of the granule core fraction revealed large numbers of well preserved crystalline cores exhibiting typical dimensions and regular internal spacings of normal mature rat beta-granule inclusions. These results provide direct biochemical evidence that the beta-granules are nonuniform in composition with the insulin contained mainly in a crystalline state in the electron-dense central inclusions while the C-peptide is dissolved in the fluid bathing the crystalline hormone. The significance of this structural organization of the beta-granule is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1562187797,"Saccharomyces cerevisiae contains two genes, SAM1 and SAM2, encoding functional S-adenosylmethionine synthetases. The gene SAM1 was isolated by functional complementation of a double mutant of S. cerevisiae, and its identity was confirmed by gene disruption. The cloned gene was used to probe wild type chromosomal DNA, and two regions hybridizing with SAM1 were found, one of which is the SAM1 region. The DNA sequence of SAM1 is reported. The translation product shows a high homology with the one deduced from the sequence of the MetK gene encoding the SAM synthetase of Escherichia coli."
https://openalex.org/W1514099227,"Plastocyanin is synthesized in the cytoplasm as a larger precursor and transported across three membranes into the chloroplast thylakoid lumen. Processing to the mature size involves successive cleavages by a stromal and a thylakoidal peptidase. In this report we describe the partial purification and characterization of the thylakoidal peptidase involved. The enzyme has been purified 36-fold from Pisum sativum thylakoids after solubilization using Triton X-100. The peptidase processes the plastocyanin import intermediate to the mature size, but no further, and is capable of processing pre-plastocyanin to the mature size but at a lower rate. No detectable activity is displayed against non-chloroplast proteins or precursors of stromal proteins. The enzyme has a pH optimum of 6.5-7 and is activated by chelating agents such as EDTA and EGTA. No inhibitors of the peptidase have been found to date."
https://openalex.org/W1595848030,"Intact cultured human fibroblasts reduced [1-14C]palmitate to radioactive hexadecanol in a concentration-dependent manner. In the presence of 30 microM radioactive palmitate, cellular levels of labeled hexadecanol increased over time and reached a steady state corresponding to at least 0.1% of cell-associated radioactive palmitate. These levels of [14C]hexadecanol were increased up to 10-fold when exogenous nonradioactive hexadecanol was present, suggesting that radioactive hexadecanol was actively metabolized. Cells incubated in acid-free medium with [1-14C]hexadecanol rapidly oxidized it to palmitic acid; less than 2% of the hexadecanol taken up by the cells was incorporated into the ether linkage of phosphatidylethanolamine, and no incorporation into wax esters was detected. Double-label experiments involving incubation of intact fibroblast with [3H]palmitate and [14C]hexadecanol demonstrated simultaneous synthesis of hexadecanol from palmitate and oxidation of hexadecanol to palmitate. Addition of exogenous palmitate to the medium of intact cells inhibited the oxidation of hexadecanol to acid in a concentration-dependent fashion. This was associated with an increase in the fibroblast content of hexadecanol and loss of hexadecanol into the medium. Activity of alcohol:NAD+ oxidoreductase, which catalyzes the oxidation of hexadecanol to palmitic acid, was inhibited by palmitoyl-CoA and NADH, but not by palmitic acid. These results are consistent with the presence of a fatty alcohol cycle in which hexadecanol is synthesized from palmitate via acyl-CoA and simultaneously oxidized back to free acid. Fatty acyl-CoA, which is the primary substrate for alcohol synthesis, may also regulate the intracellular level of alcohol by inhibiting its oxidation."
https://openalex.org/W51657100,"Previous studies with livers from fed rats perfused in the single-pass mode have shown that regulatory amino acids (Leu, Tyr, Gln, Pro, Met, His, and Trp) as a group as well as leucine alone inhibit deprivation-induced protein degradation optimally at 0.5 and 4 times (X) normal plasma amino acid concentrations. However, they lose inhibitory effectiveness almost completely within a narrow zone centered at normal (1 X) levels (Poso, A. R., Wert, J. J., Jr., and Mortimore, G.E. (1982) J. Biol. Chem. 257, 12114-12120; Poso, A. R., and Mortimore, G. E. (1984) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 81, 4270-4274). We now report similar effects for tyrosine and glutamine and suggest that this multiphasic dose response is a general feature of the regulatory group. Insulin (2.4 micrograms h-1) selectively modulated the response by abolishing the zonal loss, whereas glucagon (10 micrograms h-1) blocked the initial inhibition (0.5 X); proteolytic suppression was restored at 4 X normal plasma levels. Although the zonal loss of inhibition at 1 X was associated with a near maximal increase in the volume density of macroautophagy, the vacuoles differed from those induced by stringent amino acid deprivation in containing 4.5-fold more smooth than rough endoplasmic reticulum and thus represented a separate population. Surprisingly, the leucine analog, L-alpha-hydroxyisocaproate, elicited multiphasic responses identical to those of L-leucine, including inhibition at 0.1 mM (equivalent to 0.5 X Leu). Inasmuch as alpha-ketoisocaproate is not effective at this concentration, the initial suppression of protein degradation could be mediated from a site that recognizes structural features common to leucine and its hydroxyl analog."
https://openalex.org/W1551407530,"The mechanism of melibiose symport by the melibiose permease of Escherichia coli was studied by looking at the modifications of the facilitated diffusion properties of the permease which arise upon substitution of the coupled cations (H+, Na+, or Li+). Kinetic analysis of melibiose influx and efflux down a concentration gradient, exchange at equilibrium, and counterflow were examined in de-energized membrane vesicles resuspended in media allowing melibiose to be co-transported with either H+, Na+, or Li+. The data show that the maximal rates of melibiose efflux coupled to either H+, Na+, or Li+ are between 10 and 40 times faster than the corresponding influxes. This suggests that the permease functions asymmetrically. Cross-comparison between the rates of net [3H]melibiose entry during the influx reactions coupled to either cation and corresponding unidirectional sugar inflow during exchange and counterflow reactions leads to the conclusions that: 1) the step involving release of the co-substrates from the permease on the inner surface of the membrane is sequenced (sugar first and then coupled cation); 2) this step is rate determining for cycling of the permease. The Na+-melibiose passive flux data indicate in particular that release of Na+ ions rather than release of sugar into the intravesicular space is the slowest step during permease cycling. This property would hamper net passive Na+-melibiose influx but should allow exchange of sugar without concomitant exchange of the coupled cation. Finally, evidence is provided suggesting that the relative rates of release of the two co-substrates from the permease on the inner membrane surface varied considerably in relation to the identity of the coupled cation."
https://openalex.org/W2067247162,"The major coat protein of bacteriophage M13 is synthesized as a precursor, the procoat, with a typical leader (signal) sequence of 23 residues at its NH2-terminus. A fusion protein that contains the NH2-terminal 141 residues of cytoplasmic ribulokinase and all but the first ten residues of M13 procoat was made. The fusion protein inserts into the plasma membrane of Escherichia coli and is processed by leader peptidase to give rise to a leader peptide of 155 residues and the mature coat protein of 50 residues. The NH2-terminus of the leader peptide remains in the cytoplasm and is protected from protease added to the medium outside of the cell. This indicates that M13 procoat inserts into the membrane as a loop structure and that the NH2-terminus of a leader peptide remains within the cytoplasm during membrane insertion."

https://openalex.org/W1510252630,"A cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) of apparent Mr 74,000 has recently been purified from human plasma. Cholesteryl ester transfer activity was found to accumulate in the medium of cultured Hep G2 cells. The transfer activity was removed by immunoprecipitation with specific antibodies to the plasma CETP. Sodium dodecyl sulfate gel electrophoresis of immunoprecipitates prepared from the medium of cells pulsed with [35S]methionine revealed a broad specific band of protein of Mr 72,000 to 76,000; by contrast, immunoprecipitates of cellular homogenates showed a sharp specific band of Mr 58,000. The Mr 72,000 to 76,000 band disappears, concomitant with the appearance of lower Mr products, upon neuraminidase or glycopeptidase F treatment of medium immunoprecipitates or of purified CETP. The results indicate that liver cells have the capacity to synthesize and secrete CETP. The CETP peptide acquires asparagine-linked carbohydrate and sialic acid during intracellular processing."
https://openalex.org/W1507928574,"The dissociation of the purified human placental alpha 2 beta 2 heterotetrameric insulin receptor complex into an alpha beta heterodimeric state was found to occur in a pH- and dithiothreitol (DTT)-dependent manner. Formation of the alpha beta heterodimeric complex, under conditions which preserved tracer insulin binding and protein kinase activities (pH 8.75 for 25 min followed by 2.0 mM DTT for 5 min) occurred with an approximate 50% efficiency. The resulting nondissociated alpha 2 beta 2 heterotetrameric complexes could then be separated effectively by Bio-Gel A-1.5m gel filtration chromatography at neutral pH. The isolated DTT-treated but nondissociated alpha 2 beta 2 heterotetrameric complex was resistant to any further dissociation by a second round of DTT and alkaline pH treatment, whereas the isolated alpha beta heterodimeric complex was stable to spontaneous reassociation for at least 72 h at pH 7.60. Kinetic analyses of the insulin receptor protein kinase activity demonstrated that the insulin stimulation of glutamic acid:tyrosine (4:1) synthetic polymer phosphorylation for both the alpha 2 beta 2 heterotetrameric and alpha beta heterodimeric complexes occurred via an increase in Vmax without any significant change in Km. Examination of beta subunit autophosphorylation of the alpha beta heterodimeric complex, in the presence but not in the absence of insulin, demonstrated the appearance of the covalent 32P-labeled alpha 2 beta 2 heterotetrameric complex. Further, the initial rate of insulin-stimulated beta subunit autophosphorylation in the isolated alpha beta heterodimeric complex occurred in a dilution-dependent (intermolecular) manner. These data demonstrate that the isolated alpha beta heterodimeric insulin receptor complex is fully capable of expressing insulin-dependent activation of the beta subunit protein kinase domain with the covalent reassociation of the alpha beta heterodimeric complex into an alpha 2 beta 2 heterotetrameric disulfide-linked state."
https://openalex.org/W1538933035,"A sulfated glycoprotein was isolated from the culture media of Drosophila Kc cells and named papilin. Affinity purified antibodies against this protein localized it primarily to the basement membranes of embryos. The antibodies cross-reacted with another material which was not sulfated and appeared to be the core protein of papilin, which is proteoglycan-like. After reduction, papilin electrophoresed in sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis as a broad band of about 900,000 apparent molecular weight and the core protein as a narrow band of approximately 400,000. The core protein was formed by some cell lines and by other cells on incubation with 1 mM 4-methylumbelliferyl xyloside, which inhibited formation of the proteoglycan-like form. The buoyant density of papilin in CsCl/4 M guanidine hydrochloride is 1.4 g/ml, that of the core protein is much less. Papilin forms oligomers linked by disulfide bridges, as shown by sodium dodecyl sulfate-agarose gel electrophoresis and electron microscopy. The protomer is a 225 +/- 15-nm thread which is disulfide-linked into a loop with fine, protruding thread ends. Oligomers form clover-leaf-like structures. The protein contains 22% combined serine and threonine residues and 25% combined aspartic and glutamic residues. 10 g of polypeptide has attached 6.4 g of glucosamine, 3.1 g of galactosamine, 6.1 g of uronic acid, and 2.7 g of neutral sugars. There are about 80 O-linked carbohydrate chains/core protein molecule. Sulfate is attached to these chains. The O-linkage is through an unidentified neutral sugar. Papilin is largely resistant to common glycosidases and several proteases. The degree of sulfation varies with the sulfate concentration of the incubation medium. This proteoglycan-like glycoprotein differs substantially from corresponding proteoglycans found in vertebrate basement membranes, in contrast to Drosophila basement membrane laminin and collagen IV which have been conserved evolutionarily."

https://openalex.org/W2292066179,"We have previously demonstrated that iron plays an important regulatory role in the biosynthesis of manganese-containing superoxide dismutase in Escherichia coli (Moody, C.S., and Hassan, H.M. (1984) J. Biol. Chem. 259, 12821-12825). In this study, we demonstrated that the effect of iron is at the transcriptional/translational level, whereas the effect of manganese is at the post-translational level. The anaerobic additions of nitrate or nitrate plus paraquat caused a positive change in the redox potential of the growth medium and concomitant induction of the manganese-superoxide dismutase in the cells. By using 59Fe, we were able to identify two unique proteins that were constitutively made, but contained iron only under conditions where the synthesis of manganese-superoxide dismutase was fully repressed. The presence of a multicopy plasmid carrying the manganese-superoxide dismutase gene resulted in the anaerobic expression of the gene presumably by neutralizing the limited number of repressor molecules found in the cells. In toto, the data support our previously proposed model for a negatively controlled operon where the repressor molecule is envisioned as an allosteric redox sensing protein. Conditions known to oxidize or to deplete the iron are also found to cause induction of the manganese-superoxide dismutase albeit the absence of dioxygen."
https://openalex.org/W1497728911,"The relationship between the structure of the A subunit of pertussis toxin and its function was analyzed. Limited tryptic digestion of the A subunit converted the protein to two stable fragments (Mr = 20,000 and 18,000). Antibodies raised to synthetic peptides homologous to regions in the A subunit were used to map these fragments. Both fragments were shown to contain the NH2-terminal portion but not the COOH-terminal portion of the A subunit. While these fragments exhibited NAD glycohydrolase activity, they were unable to reassociate with the B oligomer of the toxin. Thus the COOH-terminal portion of the A subunit does not contain the residues which are required for the NAD glycohydrolase activity of the toxin. However, this region of the molecule may be important for maintaining the oligomeric structure of the toxin. These results suggest that the A subunit of pertussis toxin is similar in structure to the A subunit of cholera toxin. In addition, antibodies raised to a synthetic peptide identical to residues 6-17 of the A subunit of pertussis toxin will bind to the A subunit of cholera toxin."

W., and Roseman, S. (1987) J. Biol. Chem. 262, 16254-16260) show that inducer exclusion in intact cells of Escherichia coli is regulated by IIIGlc, a protein encoded by the crr gene of the phosphoenolpyruvate:glycose phosphotransferase system (PTS). The present studies attempt to show a direct effect of IIIGlc on non-PTS transport systems. Inner membrane vesicles prepared from a wild type strain of Salmonella typhimurium (pts+), carrying the E. coli lactose operon on an episome, showed respiration-dependent accumulation of methyl-beta-D-thiogalactopyranoside (TMG) via the lactose permease. In the presence of methyl-alpha-D-glucopyranoside or other PTS sugars, TMG uptake was reduced by an amount which was dependent on the relative concentrations of IIIGlc and lactose permease in the vesicles. The endogenous IIIGlc concentration in these vesicles was in the range 5-10 microM, similar to that found in whole cells. Methyl-alpha-glucoside had no effect on lactose permease activity in vesicles prepared from a deletion mutant strain lacking the soluble PTS proteins Enzyme I, HPr, and IIIGlc. One or more of the pure proteins could be inserted into the mutant vesicles; when one of the two electrophoretically distinguishable forms of the phosphocarrier protein, IIIGlc Slow, was inserted, both the initial rate and steady state level of TMG accumulation were reduced by up to 40%. The second electrophoretic form, IIIGlc Fast, had much less effect. A direct relationship was observed between the intravesicular concentration of IIIGlc Slow and the extent of inhibition of the lactose permease. No inhibition was observed when IIIGlc Slow was added to the outside of the vesicles, indicating that the site of interaction with the lactose permease is accessible only from the inner face of the membrane. In addition to the lactose permease, IIIGlc Slow was found to inhibit both the galactose and the melibiose permeases. Uptake of proline, on the other hand, was unaffected. The results are therefore consistent with an hypothesis that dephosphorylated IIIGlc Slow is an inhibitor of certain non-PTS permeases."
https://openalex.org/W1654020694,"Two different types of oligosaccharides, designated type 1 and 2 carbohydrate residues, are present on the contact site A molecule, an 80-kDa glycoprotein involved in the formation of EDTA-stable cell adhesion during cell aggregation in Dictyostelium discoideum. The first precursor detected by pulse-chase labeling with [35S]methionine was a 68-kDa glycoprotein carrying type 1 carbohydrate. Conversion of the precursor into the 80-kDa form occurred simultaneously with the addition of type 2 carbohydrate. Tunicamycin inhibited type 1 glycosylation more efficiently than type 2 glycosylation. The first precursor detected in tunicamycin-treated cells by pulse-chase labeling was a 53-kDa protein lacking both carbohydrates, which was converted through addition of type 2 carbohydrate into a 66-kDa final product. Labeling of intact cells indicated that this 66-kDa glycoprotein is transported to the cell surface. Prolonged treatment with tunicamycin resulted in the accumulation within the cells of the 53-kDa precursor with no detectable exposure of this protein on the cell surface. It is concluded that type 1 carbohydrate, which is cotranslationally added in N-glycosidic linkages, is neither required for transport of the protein to the Golgi apparatus nor for type 2 glycosylation or protection of the protein against proteolytic degradation. Incapability of tunicamycin-treated cells of forming EDTA-stable cell contacts suggests a role for type 1 carbohydrate in cell adhesion. Type 2 carbohydrate is added posttranslationally. It is required in the absence of type 1 glycosylation for transport of the protein to the cell surface."
https://openalex.org/W1517665044,"In vitro synthesis of Escherichia coli manganese-containing superoxide dismutase, directed by the plasmid pDT1-5, has been achieved. The Mn superoxide dismutase polypeptide was identified by electrophoresis on polyacrylamide gels, immunoprecipitation, and the competitive immunoprecipitation effect of pure, active E. coli Mn superoxide dismutase. Dithiothreitol and glutathione, but not cysteine, suppressed in vitro synthesis of Mn superoxide dismutase. The parallel syntheses of beta-lactamase and of another unidentified polypeptide were not suppressed by thiols. In vitro transcription of the E. coli Mn superoxide dismutase gene was similarly suppressed by glutathione, dithiothreitol, and beta-mercaptoethanol; but not by L-cysteine or thioglycolate. Compounds, such as diamide, 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene, potassium ferricyanide, and methylene blue, which are expected to deplete intracellular glutathione, caused the induction of Mn superoxide dismutase in anaerobic E. coli."
https://openalex.org/W1512441345,"The two principal protein components of human high density lipoprotein particles, apoA-I and apoA-II, are initially synthesized as prepropolypeptides. The function of their NH2-terminal prosegments is not known. We have previously shown that deletion of the pentapeptide prosegment (Ala-Leu-Val-Arg-Arg) from human preproapoA-II redirects signal peptidase cleavage to a site located between the second and third residues of the mature protein (Folz, R. J., and Gordon, J. I. (1986) J. Biol. Chem. 261, 14752-14759). The hexapeptide prosegment of human preproapoA-I differs from other NH2-terminal propeptides in that it terminates with paired glutamine residues (Arg-His-Phe-Trp-Gln-Gln). To examine its role in the early events of protein export, we isolated a full-length human preproapoA-I cDNA and deleted its propeptide coding region by oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis. The effects of this deletion on co-translational translocation and signal peptidase processing were assessed using an in vitro transcription/translation/microsomal membrane processing system. Propeptide deletion reduces the efficiency of co-translational translocation/processing in both reticulocyte and wheat germ lysates but does not affect the fidelity of signal peptidase cleavage. This reduced efficiency does not appear to reflect differences in signal recognition particle-nascent protein interaction as measured by a translational arrest assay. However, differences in translocation/processing rates were noted in a postinitiation translocation/cleavage assay. This assay employed the initiation inhibitor edeine to generate nascent wild type and mutant proteins of increasing chain length which were subsequently presented to canine pancreatic membranes. Unlike preproapoA-I, pre(delta pro)apoA-I retained its ability to undergo translocation and proteolytic processing even after the entire protein was synthesized. These data suggest that the propeptide in human preproapoA-I may play a role in promoting an optimal structure for co-translational translocation and processing."

https://openalex.org/W2088981838,"Murine tumor cells were induced to phagocytize either Candida albicans or group A streptococcal cells. The presence of microbial particles within the tumor cell cytoplasm had no effect on in vitro tumor cell growth. However, when Candida albicans-infected tumor cells were injected into syngeneic mice, they formed tumors that grew faster, invaded the surrounding normal tissue more rapidly and metastasized more rapidly than control tumor cells. Tumor cells infected with group A streptococcal particles did not grow faster or show increased malignant behavior. These data indicate that the in vivo behavior of malignant tumor cells can be modulated by microbial particles, which are often present in the microenvironment of the growing tumor."
https://openalex.org/W1607327958,"Hydrogenases catalyze the reversible activation of dihydrogen. We have previously demonstrated that the purified hydrogenase from the nitrogen-fixing microorganism Azotobacter vinelandii is an alpha beta dimer (98,000 Da) with subunits of 67,000 (alpha) and 31,000 (beta) daltons and that this enzyme contains iron and nickel. The enzyme can be purified anaerobically in the presence of dithionite in a fully active state that is irreversibly inactivated by exposure to O2. Analysis of this hydrogenase by sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) following boiling in SDS yields two protein staining bands corresponding to the alpha and beta subunits. However, when this enzyme was treated with SDS (25-65 degrees C) for up to 30 min under anaerobic/reductive conditions and then analyzed by anaerobic SDS-PAGE, a protein staining band corresponding to an apparent molecular mass of 58,000 Da was observed that stained for hydrogenase activity. Analysis of the 58,000-Da activity staining band by a Western immunoblot or a second aerobic SDS-polyacrylamide gel revealed that this protein actually consisted of both the alpha and beta subunits. Thus, the activity staining band (apparent 58,000 Da) represents the 98,000-Da dimer migrating abnormally on SDS-PAGE. Treatment of the anaerobically purified hydrogenase with SDS under aerobic conditions or under anaerobic conditions with electron acceptors prior to electrophoresis resulted in no activity staining band and the separated alpha and beta subunits. A. vinelandii hydrogenase was also purified under aerobic conditions in an inactive O2 stable form that can be activated by removal of oxygen followed by addition of reductant. This enzyme (as isolated), the activated form, and the reoxidized form were analyzed for their stability toward denaturation by SDS. We conclude that the dissociation of the A. vinelandii hydrogenase subunits in SDS is controlled by the redox state of the enzyme suggesting an important role of one or more redox sites in controlling the structure of this enzyme."

https://openalex.org/W1602485785,Clathrin cages were isolated from rat erythrocytes. These structures exist in the intact cell as demonstrated by immunofluorescence and were not formed during the isolation procedure. The cages were largely devoid of membrane but contained the assembly protein complex and both the 50-kDa kinase (pp50) and casein kinase II activities found previously in clathrin-coated vesicles.
