https://openalex.org/W2890105461,"Dissecting the gut-brain axis It is generally believed that cells in the gut transduce sensory information through the paracrine action of hormones. Kaelberer et al. found that, in addition to the well-described classical paracrine transduction, enteroendocrine cells also form fast, excitatory synapses with vagal afferents (see the Perspective by Hoffman and Lumpkin). This more direct circuit for gut-brain signaling uses glutamate as a neurotransmitter. Thus, sensory cues that stimulate the gut could potentially be manipulated to influence specific brain functions and behavior, including those linked to food choices.

Jalal et al. analyzed nearly 600,000 unintentional drug overdoses over a 38-year period. Although the overall mortality rate closely followed an exponential growth curve, the pattern itself is a composite of several underlying subepidemics of different drugs. Geographic hotspots have developed over time, as well as drug-specific demographic differences. Science , this issue p. eaau1184"

Small changes to temperature and concentration can have a big influence over product yield. Bédard et al. present a flow-based reaction platform that carries out this laborious task automatically. By using feedback from integrated analytics, the system converges on optimal conditions that can then be applied with high precision afterward. A series of modules with heating, cooling, mixing, and photochemical capabilities could be configured for a broad range of reactions. These include homogeneous and heterogeneous palladium-catalyzed cross-coupling, reductive amination, and the generation of sensitive intermediates under an inert atmosphere.

Yamashiro et al. went a step closer to generating mature gametes by culturing hPSCs with mouse embryonic ovarian somatic cells in xenogeneic reconstituted ovaries (see the Perspective by Gill and Peters). Over a period of 4 months, hPGCLCs underwent hallmark epigenetic reprogramming and differentiated progressively into cells closely resembling human oogonia, an immediate embryonic precursor for human oocytes.

https://openalex.org/W2891173296,"Confirming the identity of early animals The first complex organisms emerged during the Ediacaran period, around 600 million years ago. The taxonomic affiliation of many of these organisms has been difficult to discern. Fossils of Dickinsonia , bilaterally symmetrical oval organisms, have been particularly difficult to classify. Bobrovskiy et al. conducted an analysis using lipid biomarkers obtained from Dickinsonia fossils and found that the fossils contained almost exclusively cholesteroids, a marker found only in animals (see the Perspective by Summons and Erwin). Thus, Dickinsonia were basal animals. This supports the idea that the Ediacaran biota may have been a precursor to the explosion of animal forms later observed in the Cambrian, about 500 million years ago.

https://openalex.org/W2889957841,"Despite the enormous potential for the use of stereospecific cross-coupling reactions to rationally manipulate the three-dimensional structure of organic molecules, the factors that control the transfer of stereochemistry in these reactions remain poorly understood. Here we report a mechanistic and synthetic investigation into the use of enantioenriched alkylboron nucleophiles in stereospecific Pd-catalyzed Suzuki cross-coupling reactions. By developing a suite of molecular descriptors of phosphine ligands, we could apply predictive statistical models to select or design distinct ligands that respectively promoted stereoinvertive and stereoretentive cross-coupling reactions. Stereodefined branched structures were thereby accessed through the predictable manipulation of absolute stereochemistry, and a general model for the mechanism of alkylboron transmetallation was proposed."
https://openalex.org/W2891145874,"Here we report an anomalous porous molecular crystal built of C-H···N-bonded double-layered roof-floor components and wall components of a segregatively interdigitated architecture. This complicated porous structure consists of only one type of fully aromatic multijoint molecule carrying three identical dipyridylphenyl wedges. Despite its high symmetry, this molecule accomplishes difficult tasks by using two of its three wedges for roof-floor formation and using its other wedge for wall formation. Although a C-H···N bond is extremely labile, the porous crystal maintains its porosity until thermal breakdown of the C-H···N bonds at 202°C occurs, affording a nonporous polymorph. Though this nonporous crystal survives even at 325°C, it can retrieve the parent porosity under acetonitrile vapor. These findings show how one can translate simplicity into ultrahigh complexity."

We report the measurement of latitudinal differential rotation in the convection zones of 40 Sun-like stars using asteroseismology. For the most significant detections, the stars' equators rotate approximately twice as fast as their mid-latitudes. The latitudinal shear inferred from asteroseismology is much larger than predictions from numerical simulations."

One of the unique features underlying this diversity is variability of the spine, which facilitates everything from flexibility for speedy running and support for upright walking.

These regions then differentiated further, leading to the highly varied mammalian forms we see today. Science , this issue p. 1249"
https://openalex.org/W2890938599,"Increasing evidence suggests that an enriched environment (EE) ameliorates cognitive impairment by promoting repair of brain damage. However, the mechanisms by which this occurs have not been determined. To address this issue, we investigated whether an EE enhanced the capability of endogenous bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem/stromal cells (BM-MSCs) to prevent hippocampal damage due to diabetes by focusing on miRNA carried in BM-MSC-derived exosomes. In diabetic streptozotocin (STZ) rats housed in an EE (STZ/EE), cognitive impairment was significantly reduced, and both neuronal and astroglial damage in the hippocampus was alleviated compared with STZ rats housed in conventional cages (STZ/CC). BM-MSCs isolated from STZ/CC rats had functional and morphological abnormalities that were not detected in STZ/EE BM-MSCs. The miR-146a levels in exosomes in conditioned medium of cultured BM-MSCs and serum from STZ/CC rats were decreased compared with non-diabetic rats, and the level was restored in STZ/EE rats. Thus, the data suggest that increased levels of miR-146a in sera were derived from endogenous BM-MSCs in STZ/EE rats. To examine the possibility that increased miR-146a in serum may exert anti-inflammatory effects on astrocytes in diabetic rats, astrocytes transfected with miR-146a were stimulated with advanced glycation end products (AGEs) to mimic diabetic conditions. The expression of IRAK1, NF-κB, and tumor necrosis factor-α was significantly higher in AGE-stimulated astrocytes, and these factors were decreased in miR-146a-transfected astrocytes. These results suggested that EEs stimulate up-regulation of exosomal miR-146a secretion by endogenous BM-MSCs, which exerts anti-inflammatory effects on damaged astrocytes and prevents diabetes-induced cognitive impairment."
https://openalex.org/W2890711678,"The periodic stripes and spots that often adorn animals' coats have been largely viewed as self-organizing patterns, forming through dynamics such as Turing's reaction-diffusion within the developing skin. Whether preexisting positional information also contributes to the periodicity and orientation of these patterns has, however, remained unclear. We used natural variation in colored stripes of juvenile galliform birds to show that stripes form in a two-step process. Autonomous signaling from the somite sets stripe position by forming a composite prepattern marked by the expression profile of agouti Subsequently, agouti regulates stripe width through dose-dependent control of local pigment production. These results reveal that early developmental landmarks can shape periodic patterns upstream of late local dynamics, and thus constrain their evolution."
https://openalex.org/W2890349859,"Autophagy plays many physiological and pathophysiological roles. However, the roles and the regulatory mechanisms of autophagy in response to viral infections are poorly defined in teleost fish, such as grass carp (Ctenopharyngodon idella), which is one of the most important aquaculture species in China. In this study, we found that both grass carp reovirus (GCRV) infection and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) treatment induced the accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in C. idella kidney cells and stimulate autophagy. Suppressing ROS accumulation with N-acetyl-l-cysteine significantly inhibited GCRV-induced autophagy activation and enhanced GCRV replication. Although ROS-induced autophagy, in turn, restricted GCRV replication, further investigation revealed that the multifunctional cellular protein high-mobility group box 1b (HMGB1b) serves as a heat shock protein 70 (HSP70)–dependent, pro-autophagic protein in grass carp. Upon H2O2 treatment, cytoplasmic HSP70 translocated to the nucleus, where it interacted with HMGB1b and promoted cytoplasmic translocation of HMGB1b. Overexpression and siRNA-mediated knockdown assays indicated that HSP70 and HMGB1b synergistically enhance ROS-induced autophagic activation in the cytoplasm. Moreover, HSP70 reinforced an association of HMGB1b with the C. idella ortholog of Beclin 1 (a mammalian ortholog of the autophagy-associated yeast protein ATG6) by directly interacting with C. idella Beclin 1. In summary, this study highlights the antiviral function of ROS-induced autophagy in response to GCRV infection and reveals the positive role of HSP70 in HMGB1b-mediated autophagy initiation in teleost fish."
https://openalex.org/W2889582481,"We apply standard demographic principles of inflows and outflows to estimate the number of undocumented immigrants in the United States, using the best available data, including some that have only recently become available. Our analysis covers the years 1990 to 2016. We develop an estimate of the number of undocumented immigrants based on parameter values that tend to underestimate undocumented immigrant inflows and overstate outflows; we also show the probability distribution for the number of undocumented immigrants based on simulating our model over parameter value ranges. Our conservative estimate is 16.7 million for 2016, nearly fifty percent higher than the most prominent current estimate of 11.3 million, which is based on survey data and thus different sources and methods. The mean estimate based on our simulation analysis is 22.1 million, essentially double the current widely accepted estimate. Our model predicts a similar trajectory of growth in the number of undocumented immigrants over the years of our analysis, but at a higher level. While our analysis delivers different results, we note that it is based on many assumptions. The most critical of these concern border apprehension rates and voluntary emigration rates of undocumented immigrants in the U.S. These rates are uncertain, especially in the 1990's and early 2000's, which is when-both based on our modeling and the very different survey data approach-the number of undocumented immigrants increases most significantly. Our results, while based on a number of assumptions and uncertainties, could help frame debates about policies whose consequences depend on the number of undocumented immigrants in the United States."
https://openalex.org/W2891631068,"Rising river temperatures in western North America have increased the energetic costs of migration and the risk of premature mortality in many Pacific salmon (Oncorhynchus spp.) populations. Predicting and managing risks for these populations requires data on acute and cumulative thermal exposure, the spatio-temporal distribution of adverse conditions, and the potentially mitigating effects of cool-water refuges. In this study, we paired radiotelemetry with archival temperature loggers to construct continuous, spatially-explicit thermal histories for 212 adult Chinook salmon (O. tshawytscha) and 200 adult steelhead (O. mykiss). The fish amassed ~500,000 temperature records (30-min intervals) while migrating through 470 kilometers of the Columbia and Snake rivers en route to spawning sites in Idaho, Oregon, and Washington. Spring- and most summer-run Chinook salmon migrated before river temperatures reached annual highs; their body temperatures closely matched ambient temperatures and most had thermal maxima in the lower Snake River. In contrast, many individual fall-run Chinook salmon and most steelhead had maxima near thermal tolerance limits (20–22 °C) in the lower Columbia River. High temperatures elicited extensive use of thermal refuges near tributary confluences, where body temperatures were ~2–10 °C cooler than the adjacent migration corridor. Many steelhead used refuges for weeks or more whereas salmon use was typically hours to days, reflecting differences in spawn timing. Almost no refuge use was detected in a ~260-km reach where a thermal migration barrier may more frequently develop in future warmer years. Within population, cumulative thermal exposure was strongly positively correlated (0.88 ≤ r ≤ 0.98) with migration duration and inconsistently associated (-0.28 ≤ r ≤ 0.09) with migration date. All four populations have likely experienced historically high mean and maximum temperatures in recent years. Expected responses include population-specific shifts in migration phenology, increased reliance on patchily-distributed thermal refuges, and natural selection favoring temperature-tolerant phenotypes."
https://openalex.org/W2890955417,"The reduction of chemical fungicides in agriculture has led to the use of microorganisms as biocontrol agents. Starmerella bacillaris is a non-Saccharomyces yeast associated with overripe and botrytized grape berries microbiota. Its use has been proposed for wine fermentation because of yeast fructophilic character and high glycerol production. Recently, S. bacillaris has been demonstrated to possess antifungal activity against Botrytis cinerea on the grape. Penicillium expansum is the pathogen responsible for the blue mold rot, the most important postharvest disease of apples. These fruits are the raw material of the cider, an alcoholic beverage commonly produced using S. cerevisiae starter cultures. In this study 14 S. bacillaris strains have been studied to evaluate their postharvest antifungal activity against P. expansum on apples. Moreover, the fermentation performances in apple juice of these non-Saccharomyces strains were tested, both in single-strain fermentation and in sequential fermentation, together with S. cerevisiae. Four S. bacillaris strains, able to significantly decrease blue mold rot symptoms and to increase glycerol content during fermentation have been selected to improve apple and cider quality."
https://openalex.org/W2890916326,"Ocean acidification has the potential to significantly impact both aquaculture and wild-caught mollusk fisheries around the world. In this work, we build upon a previously published integrated assessment model of the US Atlantic Sea Scallop (Placopecten magellanicus) fishery to determine the possible future of the fishery under a suite of climate, economic, biological, and management scenarios. We developed a 4x4x4x4 hypercube scenario framework that resulted in 256 possible combinations of future scenarios. The study highlights the potential impacts of ocean acidification and management for a subset of future climate scenarios, with a high CO2 emissions case (RCP8.5) and lower CO2 emissions and climate mitigation case (RCP4.5). Under RCP4.5 and the highest impact and management scenario, ocean acidification has the potential to reduce sea scallop biomass by approximately 13% by the end of century; however, the lesser impact scenarios cause very little change. Under RCP8.5, sea scallop biomass may decline by more than 50% by the end of century, leading to subsequent declines in industry landings and revenue. Management-set catch limits improve the outcomes of the fishery under both climate scenarios, and the addition of a 10% area closure increases future biomass by more than 25% under the highest ocean acidification impacts. However, increased management still does not stop the projected long-term decline of the fishery under ocean acidification scenarios. Given our incomplete understanding of acidification impacts on P. magellanicus, these declines, along with the high value of the industry, suggest population-level effects of acidification should be a clear research priority. Projections described in this manuscript illustrate both the potential impacts of ocean acidification under a business-as-usual and a moderately strong climate-policy scenario. We also illustrate the importance of fisheries management targets in improving the long-term outcome of the P. magellanicus fishery under potential global change."

https://openalex.org/W2952911902,"Due to limited fish meal and fish oil resources and their high costs for the aquaculture industry, it is necessary to find alternative sustainable sources of protein and lipids. Therefore, seven different diets were formulated with different levels of animal by-products, vegetable proteins, fish oil and rapeseed oil, to feed farmed Atlantic salmon, and their effects on growth performance, muscle lipid class, and fatty acid composition were examined. Protein sources included anchovy, poultry, feather, blood, corn, soy and wheat. Growth performance indicated that the diet with the lowest fish meal and fish oil content resulted in the lowest weight gain and final weight, followed by the diet containing the highest level of animal by-products. The lipid class analysis showed no statistical difference in the muscle total lipid content using different diets. However, significant statistical differences were observed among the main lipid classes; triacylglycerols, phospholipids, and sterols. The diet containing 1.4% omega-3 long-chain fatty acids resulted in the highest content of triacylglycerols and phospholipids. Diets containing medium and low levels of fish oil and fish meal, respectively, led to as high a level of ω3 fatty acids in muscle as when fish were fed diets with high levels of fish meal and fish oil. The results of this study suggest that feeding a diet containing low levels of fish meal and moderate levels of fish oil does not significantly affect ω3 fatty acid composition in muscle. Fish meal could be reduced to 5% without affecting growth as long as there was a minimum of 5% fish oil, and animal by-products did not exceed 26% of the diet."
https://openalex.org/W2890578454,"Unsafe abortion is still a leading cause of maternal death in most Sub-Saharan African countries. Post-abortion care (PAC) aims to minimize morbidity and mortality following unsafe abortion, addressing incomplete abortion by treating complications, and reducing possible future unwanted pregnancies by providing contraceptive advice. In this article, we draw on data from PAC service providers and patients in Kenya to illustrate how the quality of PAC in healthcare facilities is impacted by law and government policy.A cross-sectional design was used for this study, with in-depth interviews conducted to collect qualitative data from PAC service providers and seekers in healthcare facilities. Data were analyzed both deductively and inductively, with diverse sub-themes related to specific components of PAC quality.The provision of quality PAC in healthcare facilities in Kenya is still low, with access hindered by restrictions on abortion. Negative attitudes towards abortion result in the continued undirected self-administration of abortifacients. Intermittent service interruptions through industrial strikes and inequitable access to care also drive unsafe terminations. Poor PAC service availability and lack of capacity to manage complications in primary care facilities result in multiple referrals and delays in care following abortion, leading to further complications. Inefficient infection control exposes patients and caregivers to unrelated infections within facilities, and the adequate provision of contraception is a continued challenge.Legal, policy and cultural restrictions to access PAC increase the level of complications. In Kenya, there is limited policy focus on PAC, especially at primary care level, and no guidelines for health providers to provide legal, safe abortion. Discrimination at the point of care discourages women from presenting for care, and discourages providers from freely offering post-abortion contraceptive guidance and services. Poor communication between facilities and communities continues to result in delayed care and access-related discrimination.Greater emphasis should be placed on the prevention of unsafe abortion and improved access to post-abortion care services in healthcare facilities. There is a definite need for service guidelines for this to occur."
https://openalex.org/W2892024408,"DNA mismatch repair (MMR) corrects mispaired DNA bases and small insertion/deletion loops generated by DNA replication errors. After binding a mispair, the eukaryotic mispair recognition complex Msh2–Msh6 binds ATP in both of its nucleotide-binding sites, which induces a conformational change resulting in the formation of an Msh2–Msh6 sliding clamp that releases from the mispair and slides freely along the DNA. However, the roles that Msh2–Msh6 sliding clamps play in MMR remain poorly understood. Here, using Saccharomyces cerevisiae, we created Msh2 and Msh6 Walker A nucleotide–binding site mutants that have defects in ATP binding in one or both nucleotide-binding sites of the Msh2–Msh6 heterodimer. We found that these mutations cause a complete MMR defect in vivo. The mutant Msh2–Msh6 complexes exhibited normal mispair recognition and were proficient at recruiting the MMR endonuclease Mlh1–Pms1 to mispaired DNA. At physiological (2.5 mm) ATP concentration, the mutant complexes displayed modest partial defects in supporting MMR in reconstituted Mlh1–Pms1-independent and Mlh1–Pms1-dependent MMR reactions in vitro and in activation of the Mlh1–Pms1 endonuclease and showed a more severe defect at low (0.1 mm) ATP concentration. In contrast, five of the mutants were completely defective and one was mostly defective for sliding clamp formation at high and low ATP concentrations. These findings suggest that mispair-dependent sliding clamp formation triggers binding of additional Msh2–Msh6 complexes and that further recruitment of additional downstream MMR proteins is required for signal amplification of mispair binding during MMR.

In both human and Saccharomyces cerevisiae Msh2–Msh6, the Msh2 subunit controls the cycle of ATP processing. After Msh2–Msh6 binds mispaired DNA, release of Mg2+ from the Msh2 nucleotide-binding site causes release of ADP from Msh2, which then allows Msh6 to bind ATP (23Gradia S. Acharya S. Fishel R.

Msh2–Msh6 binding to mispaired DNA also results in a reduction of the ATPase activity of Msh6 (26Antony E. Hingorani M.M.

When Msh2–Msh6 and other members of the MutS family of MMR proteins bind to mispaired bases, they form a ring around the DNA with the mispair recognition domain of Msh6 (or Msh3 or the mispair-binding subunit of MutS) making contacts with both the mispair and adjacent sites on the DNA; these contacts also result in bending of the DNA (13Obmolova G.

https://openalex.org/W2890611412,"Background High altitude associated hypobaric hypoxia is one of the cellular and environmental perturbation that alters proteostasis network and push the healthy cell towards loss of muscle mass. The present study has elucidated the robust proteostasis network and signaling mechanism for skeletal muscle atrophy under chronic hypobaric hypoxia (CHH). Methods Male Sprague Dawley rats were exposed to simulated hypoxia equivalent to a pressure of 282 torr for different durations (1, 3, 7 and 14 days). After CHH exposure, skeletal muscle tissue was excised from the hind limb of rats for biochemical analysis. Results Chronic hypobaric hypoxia caused a substantial increase in protein oxidation and exhibited a greater activation of ER chaperones, glucose-regulated protein-78 (GRP-78) and protein disulphide isomerase (PDI) till 14d of CHH. Presence of oxidized proteins triggered the proteolytic systems, 20S proteasome and calpain pathway which were accompanied by a marked increase in [Ca2+]. Upregulated Akt pathway was observed upto 07d of CHH which was also linked with enhanced glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSk-3β) expression, a negative regulator of Akt. Muscle-derived cytokines, tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interferon-ϒ (IFN-©) and interleukin-1β (IL-1β) levels significantly increased from 07d onwards. CHH exposure also upregulated the expression of nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-κB) and E3 ligase, muscle atrophy F-box-1 (Mafbx-1/Atrogin-1) and MuRF-1 (muscle ring finger-1) on 07d and 14d. Further, severe hypoxia also lead to increase expression of ER-associated degradation (ERAD) CHOP/ GADD153, Ub-proteasome and apoptosis pathway. Conclusions The disrupted proteostasis network was tightly coupled to degradative pathways, altered anabolic signaling, inflammation, and apoptosis under chronic hypoxia. Severe and prolonged hypoxia exposure affected the protein homeostasis which overwhelms the muscular system and tends towards skeletal muscle atrophy."
https://openalex.org/W2890988972,"New rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) for screening human African trypanosomiasis (HAT) have been introduced as alternatives to the card agglutination test for trypanosomiasis (CATT). One brand of RDT, the SD BIOLINE HAT RDT has been shown to have lower specificity but higher sensitivity than CATT, so to make a rational choice between screening strategies, a cost-effectiveness analysis is a key element. In this paper we estimate the relative cost-effectiveness of CATT and the RDT when implemented in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). Data on the epidemiological parameters and costs were collected as part of a larger study. These data were used to model three different diagnostic algorithms in mobile teams and fixed health facilities, and the relative cost-effectiveness was measured as the average cost per case diagnosed. In both fixed facilities and mobile teams, screening of participants using the SD BIOLINE HAT RDT followed by parasitological confirmation had a lower cost-effectiveness ratio than in algorithms using CATT. Algorithms using the RDT were cheaper by 112.54 (33.2%) and 88.54 (32.92%) US dollars per case diagnosed in mobile teams and fixed health facilities respectively, when compared with algorithms using CATT. Sensitivity analysis demonstrated that these conclusions were robust to a number of assumptions, and that the results can be scaled to smaller or larger facilities, and a range of prevalences. The RDT was the most cost-effective screening test in all realistic scenarios and detected more cases than CATT. Thus, on this basis, the SD BIOLINE HAT RDT could be considered as the most cost-effective option for use in routine screening for HAT in the DRC."

In shallow marine environments, daily light integrals (DLI) can vary several-fold in response to water clarity and clouds. This laboratory study investigated the responses of two coral species to fluctuations in DLI. Corals were exposed to four contrasting DLI treatments: 'high-light' (potentially photoinhibiting conditions, 32 mol photons m-2 d-1), 'low-light' (potentially light-limiting conditions, 6 mol photons m-2 d-1), and two 'variable light' treatments that alternated between high and low conditions every 5 days. In the variable treatments, the shade-tolerant coral Pachyseris speciosa displayed cycles of rapid declines in maximum quantum yield during high-light and subsequent recoveries during low-light, showing photoacclimation at a time scale of 3-5 days. In contrast, the shallow-water coral Acropora millepora showed slow (>20 days) photoacclimation, and minimal changes in photosynthetic yields despite contrasting light exposure. However, growth (change in buoyant weight) in A. millepora was significantly slower under variable light, and even more so under low-light conditions, compared with high-light conditions. The responses of yields in P. speciosa match their preference for low-light environments, but suggest a vulnerability to even short periods of high-light exposure. In contrast, A. millepora had better tolerance of high-light conditions, however its slow photoacclimatory responses limit its growth under low and variable conditions. The study shows contrasting photoacclimatory responses in variable light environments, which is important to identify and understand as many coastal and midshelf reefs are becoming increasingly more turbid, and may experience higher variability in light availability."

Parameters were estimated using a maximum likelihood method for the entire outbreak as well as for two phases defined by the daily number of newly detected HPAI-positive premises. The results indicate both a strong dependence of the likelihood of transmission on distance and a significant distance-independent component of outbreak spread for the overall outbreak. The results further suggest that HPAI spread differed during the later phase of the outbreak. The estimated spatial transmission kernel was used to compare the Minnesota outbreak with previous HPAI outbreaks in the Netherlands and Italy to contextualize the Minnesota transmission kernel results and make additional inferences about HPAI transmission during the Minnesota outbreak. Lastly, the spatial transmission kernel was used to identify high risk areas for HPAI spread in Minnesota. Risk maps were also used to evaluate the potential impact of an early marketing strategy implemented by poultry producers in a county in Minnesota during the outbreak, with results providing evidence that the strategy was successful in reducing the potential for HPAI spread."

https://openalex.org/W2902060873,"Oxidative stress is believed to be a major driver of inflammation in smoking asthmatics. The U-BIOPRED project recruited a cohort of Severe Asthma smokers/ex-smokers (SAs/ex) and non-smokers (SAn) with extensive clinical and biomarker information enabling characterization of these subjects. We investigated oxidative stress in severe asthma subjects by analysing urinary 8-iso-PGF2α and the mRNA-expression of the main pro-oxidant (NOX2; NOSs) and anti-oxidant (SODs; CAT; GPX1) enzymes in the airways of SAs/ex and SAn. All the severe asthma U-BIOPRED subjects were further divided into current smokers with severe asthma (CSA), ex-smokers with severe asthma (ESA) and non-smokers with severe asthma (NSA) to deepen the effect of active smoking. Clinical data, urine and sputum were obtained from severe asthma subjects. A bronchoscopy to obtain bronchial biopsy and brushing was performed in a subset of subjects. The main clinical data were analysed for each subset of subjects (urine-8-iso-PGF2α; IS-transcriptomics; BB-transcriptomics; BBr-transcriptomics). Urinary 8-iso-PGF2α was quantified using mass spectrometry. Sputum, bronchial biopsy and bronchial brushing were processed for mRNA expression microarray analysis. Urinary 8-iso-PGF2α was increased in SAs/ex, median (IQR) = 31.7 (24.5–44.7) ng/mmol creatinine, compared to SAn, median (IQR) = 26.6 (19.6–36.6) ng/mmol creatinine (p< 0.001), and in CSA, median (IQR) = 34.25 (24.4–47.7), vs. ESA, median (IQR) = 29.4 (22.3–40.5), and NSA, median (IQR) = 26.5 (19.6–16.6) ng/mmol creatinine (p = 0.004). Sputum mRNA expression of NOX2 was increased in SAs/ex compared to SAn (probe sets 203922_PM_s_at fold-change = 1.05 p = 0.006; 203923_PM_s_at fold-change = 1.06, p = 0.003; 233538_PM_s_at fold-change = 1.06, p = 0.014). The mRNA expression of antioxidant enzymes were similar between the two severe asthma cohorts in all airway samples. NOS2 mRNA expression was decreased in bronchial brushing of SAs/ex compared to SAn (fold-change = -1.10; p = 0.029). NOS2 mRNA expression in bronchial brushing correlated with FeNO (Kendal’s Tau = 0.535; p< 0.001). From clinical and inflammatory analysis, FeNO was lower in CSA than in ESA in all the analysed subject subsets (p< 0.01) indicating an effect of active smoking. Results about FeNO suggest its clinical limitation, as inflammation biomarker, in severe asthma active smokers. These data provide evidence of greater systemic oxidative stress in severe asthma smokers as reflected by a significant changes of NOX2 mRNA expression in the airways, together with elevated urinary 8-iso-PGF2α in the smokers/ex-smokers group.

https://openalex.org/W2889681457,"As a traditional Chinese medicine, Ganoderma lingzhi has attracted increasing attention for both scientific research and medical application. In this work, in order to improve the production of polysaccharides from an original wide-type (WT) strain (named ""RWY-0"") of Ganoderma lingzhi, we applied atmospheric-pressure dielectric barrier discharge (DBD) nonthermal plasma to the protoplasts of RWY-0 for mutagenesis treatment. Through a randomly amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) assay, at least 10 mutagenic strains were confirmed. They also showed different mycelium characteristics in terms of shape, color, size and biomass in liquid fermentation. The mutant strains were examined by infrared spectroscopy, and based on the established near-infrared (NIR) quantification model, the polysaccharide contents in these mutants were quantitatively evaluated. As a result, we found that the Ganoderma polysaccharide contents in some of the mutant strains were significantly changed compared with that of the original WT strain. The polysaccharide content of RWY-1 G. lingzhi was considerably higher than that of the WT strain, with an increase of 25.6%. Thus, this preliminary work demonstrates the extension of the plasma mutagenesis application in acquiring polysaccharide-enhanced Ganoderma lingzhi mutants and shows the usefulness of NIR spectroscopy in the rapid screening of mutagenic strains for other important ingredients."

https://openalex.org/W2890079584,"Elucidation of mechanisms underlying the increased androgen receptor (AR) activity and subsequent development of aggressive prostate cancer (PrCa) is pivotal in developing new therapies. Using a systems biology approach, we interrogated the AR-regulated proteome and identified PDZ binding kinase (PBK) as a novel AR-regulated protein that regulates full-length AR and AR variants (ARVs) activity in PrCa. PBK overexpression in aggressive PrCa is associated with early biochemical relapse and poor clinical outcome. In addition to its carboxy terminus ligand-binding domain, PBK directly interacts with the amino terminus transactivation domain of the AR to stabilise it thereby leading to increased AR protein expression observed in PrCa. Transcriptome sequencing revealed that PBK is a mediator of global AR signalling with key roles in regulating tumour invasion and metastasis. PBK inhibition decreased growth of PrCa cell lines and clinical specimen cultured ex vivo. We uncovered a novel interplay between AR and PBK that results in increased AR and ARVs expression that executes AR-mediated growth and progression of PrCa, with implications for the development of PBK inhibitors for the treatment of aggressive PrCa."
https://openalex.org/W2890571171,"Discovery of unidentified protein functions is of biological importance because it often provides new paradigms for many research areas. Mammalian heme oxygenase (HO) enzyme catalyzes the O2-dependent degradation of heme into carbon monoxide (CO), iron, and biliverdin through numerous reaction intermediates. Here, we report that H2S, a gaseous signaling molecule, is part of a novel reaction pathway that drastically alters HO's products, reaction mechanism, and catalytic properties. Our prediction of this interplay is based on the unique reactivity of H2S with one of the HO intermediates. We found that in the presence of H2S, HO produces new linear tetrapyrroles, which we identified as isomers of sulfur-containing biliverdin (SBV), and that only H2S, but not GSH, cysteine, and polysulfides, induces SBV formation. As BV is converted to bilirubin (BR), SBV is enzymatically reduced to sulfur-containing bilirubin (SBR), which shares similar properties such as antioxidative effects with normal BR. SBR was detected in culture media of mouse macrophages, confirming the existence of this H2S-induced reaction in mammalian cells. H2S reacted specifically with a ferric verdoheme intermediate of HO, and verdoheme cleavage proceeded through an O2-independent hydrolysis-like mechanism. This change in activation mode diminished O2 dependence of the overall HO activity, circumventing the rate-limiting O2 activation of HO. We propose that H2S could largely affect O2 sensing by mammalian HO, which is supposed to relay hypoxic signals by decreasing CO output to regulate cellular functions.

https://openalex.org/W2890281644,"Lethal collisions with ships are limiting the recovery of several at-risk whale species worldwide. In the St. Lawrence Estuary (Quebec, Canada), the endangered blue whale and of special concern fin whale are among the migratory species subject to collisions with large ships. In 2011, a working group composed of representatives from the maritime industry, the government, non-governmental organizations, and academia was created to explore solutions to mitigate ship-whale collisions in the St. Lawrence Estuary. Adopting an adaptive risk management framework, the working group took advantage of the best available scientific data and tools to co-construct realistic collision mitigation options and evaluate their likely benefits for whale conservation and costs for the industry. In 2013, the working group recommended the implementation of voluntary measures to mitigate collision risks, consisting of a slow-down area, a no-go area, and a caution area; a recommended route was added in 2014. Along with the voluntary framework, the working group agreed to continuously monitor compliance with and assess effectiveness of these mitigation measures. After the fourth year of implementation, voluntary measures showed encouraging results, with a reduction of up to 40% of lethal collision risks with fin whales in the highest density area. This reduction in risk is mainly related to ship speed reduction in the slow-down area from 14.1 ± 2.6 knots in 2012 to 11.3 ± 1.7 knots since 2014. The presence of a mandatory pilotage area overlapping with the slow-down area was instrumental to facilitate communication about the mitigation measures, with the pilotage corporation sitting as a regular member of the working group. This resulted in significantly slower speeds in the slow-down area for ships with a pilot from the pilotage corporation onboard compared to those without (-0.8 knots, p-value < 0.001). It is also likely to explain the weaker compliance of the maritime industry with the no-go area located outside of the mandatory pilotage area. Other factors of success include: the continuous dedication of the government to a voluntary and transparent participatory process; the use of available data, tools and institutions; the presence of an environmental certification program representative in the working group; and the adoption by consensus of an adaptive risk management approach. The traditional regulatory approach to conservation is often blamed for its focus on deterring negative behaviors, doing nothing to encourage and reward positive ones. In agreement with other case studies, the benefits of the voluntary measures implemented in the St. Lawrence Estuary include the pro-active commitment from the industry (which is likely to reduce conflicts with regulators), the greater flexibility and freedom that allowed to come up with cost-effective and tailored-made mitigation measures, and the fast achievement of conservation gains. More importantly perhaps, the human and working capital built throughout the concertation process have the potential to be a fundamental cornerstone in dealing with more complex issues such as the chronically increasing level of underwater noise in whale habitats."
https://openalex.org/W2891662805,"Introduction Reliable and timely immunization data is vital at all levels of health care to inform decisions and improve program performance. Inadequate data quality may impair our understanding of the true vaccination coverage and also hinder our capability to meet the program objectives. It’s therefore important to regularly assess immunization data quality to ensure good performance, sound decision making and efficient use of resources. Methods We conducted an immunization data quality audit between July and August 2016. The verification factor was estimated by dividing the recounted diphtheria, pertussis and tetanus third dose vaccination for children under 1 year (DPT3<1 year) by reported DPT3<1 year. The quality of data collection processes was measured using quality indices for the 3 different components: recording practices, storage/reporting, monitoring and evaluation. These indices were applied to the different levels of the health care service delivery system. Quality index score was estimated by dividing the total question or observation correctly answered by the total number of answers/ observations for a particular component. Results The mean health center verification factor was 87%. Sixty five percent (32/49) of the health centers had consistent data, 27% (13/49) over reported and 4% (2/49) under-reported. Health center 11s and 111s contributed to over-reporting and under-reporting. All the health centers’ reports were complete and timely between January and June and from November to December. The mean quality indices for the 3 different componets assessed were; recording practices 66%, storing/reporting 75%, monitoring and evaluation 43%. There was a weak positive correlation between the health center verifaction factor and quality index though this was not statistically significant (r = 0.014; p = 0.92). Conclusion Lower level health centers contributed significantly to the inconsistencies in immunization data; there were wide variation between the quality indices of recording practices, storage/reporting, monitoring and evaluation. We recommended that District Local Governments and Ministry of Health focus on improving data quality at lower levels of health service delivery."

Chicken primordial germ cells (cPGCs), a germinal pluripotent avian cell type, present the ability of self-renewal, an anchorage-independent cell growth and the ability to be genetically modified. This cell type could be an interesting bioreactor system for industrial purposes. This study sought to establish an expandable culture system with defined components for three-dimensional (3D) culture of cPGCs. cPGCs were cultured in medium supplemented with the functional polymer FP003. Viscoelasticity was low in this medium but cPGCs did not sediment in culture and efficiencies of space and nutrient utilization were thus enhanced and consequently their expansion was improved. The total number of cPGCs increased by 17-fold after 1 week of culture in 3D-FAot medium, an aseric defined medium containing FP003 polymer, FGF2 and Activin A as growth factors and Ovotransferrin as protein. Moreover, cPGC cell lines stably expressed the germline-specific reporter VASA:tdTOMATO, as well as other markers of cPGCs, for more than 1 month upon culture in 3D-FAot medium, indicating that the characteristics of these cells are maintained. In summary, this novel 3D culture system can be used to efficiently expand cPGCs in suspension without mechanical stirring, which is available for long-term culture and no loss of cellular properties was found. This system provides a platform for large-scale culture of cPGCs."
https://openalex.org/W2889652505,"In humans, transport of food-derived cobalamin (vitamin B12) from the digestive system into the bloodstream involves three paralogous proteins: transcobalamin (TC), haptocorrin (HC), and intrinsic factor (IF). Each of these proteins contains two domains, an α-domain and a β-domain, which together form a cleft in which cobalamin binds. Zebrafish (Danio rerio) are thought to possess only a single cobalamin transport protein, referred to as Tcn2, which is a transcobalamin homolog. Here, we used CRISPR/Cas9 mutagenesis to create null alleles of tcn2 in zebrafish. Fish homozygous for tcn2-null alleles were viable and exhibited no obvious developmentally or behaviorally abnormal phenotypes. For this reason, we hypothesized that previously unidentified cobalamin-carrier proteins encoded in the zebrafish genome may provide an additional pathway for cobalamin transport. We identified genes predicted to code for two such proteins, Tcn-beta-a (Tcnba) and Tcn-beta-b (Tcnbb), which differ from all previously characterized cobalamin transport proteins as they lack the α-domain. These β-domain–only proteins are representative of an undescribed class of cobalamin-carrier proteins that are highly conserved throughout the ray-finned fishes. We observed that the genes encoding the three cobalamin transport homologs, tcn2, tcnba, and tcnbb, are expressed in unique spatial and temporal patterns in the developing zebrafish. Moreover, exogenously expressed recombinant Tcnba and Tcnbb bound cobalamin with high affinity, comparable with binding by full-length Tcn2. Taken together, our results suggest that this noncanonical protein structure has evolved to fully function as a cobalamin-carrier protein, thereby allowing for a compensatory cobalamin transport mechanism in the tcn2−/− zebrafish. In humans, transport of food-derived cobalamin (vitamin B12) from the digestive system into the bloodstream involves three paralogous proteins: transcobalamin (TC), haptocorrin (HC), and intrinsic factor (IF). Each of these proteins contains two domains, an α-domain and a β-domain, which together form a cleft in which cobalamin binds. Zebrafish (Danio rerio) are thought to possess only a single cobalamin transport protein, referred to as Tcn2, which is a transcobalamin homolog. Here, we used CRISPR/Cas9 mutagenesis to create null alleles of tcn2 in zebrafish. Fish homozygous for tcn2-null alleles were viable and exhibited no obvious developmentally or behaviorally abnormal phenotypes. For this reason, we hypothesized that previously unidentified cobalamin-carrier proteins encoded in the zebrafish genome may provide an additional pathway for cobalamin transport. We identified genes predicted to code for two such proteins, Tcn-beta-a (Tcnba) and Tcn-beta-b (Tcnbb), which differ from all previously characterized cobalamin transport proteins as they lack the α-domain.

Vitamin B12, also referred to as cobalamin, is a micronutrient that acts as a cofactor for two enzymes: methionine synthase, which is involved in the one-carbon metabolism pathway, and methylmalonyl-CoA mutase, which is involved in the catabolism of amino acids and odd-chain fatty acids. As only bacteria and archaea are capable of cobalamin synthesis, animals must obtain vitamin B12 from their diet where it is generally found as a trace component or from their gastrointestinal microbiome. In humans, vitamin B12 deficiency can be caused by a variety of factors; these include increased demand (as is the case during pregnancy), decreased absorption and/or increased excretion (often observed in the elderly and those suffering from diseases involving malabsorption and renal dysfunction), low dietary intake, and inborn errors of the cobalamin transport and absorption pathways (1Green R.

In humans, the path of cobalamin transport through the digestive system, bloodstream, and into the cell requires a host of support proteins required for uptake, transport, and chemical modification.

Although these proteins share similar domain structures, each has distinct roles in cobalamin transport. HC, produced in the saliva, is responsible for the transport of cobalamin through the upper digestive tract. HC is degraded in the duodenum, allowing IF to bind cobalamin. IF is responsible for carrying cobalamin through the remainder of the digestive tract to the terminal ileum, where receptor-mediated endocytosis moves the vitamin into epithelial cells before secreting it into the bloodstream. Both HC and TC bind cobalamin in the blood; however, only TC-bound cobalamin is available to most cells for uptake via the transcobalamin receptor CD320. HC is also present in the blood, where it carries ∼80% of the total cobalamin in plasma and is theorized to act as a scavenger for clearing cobalamin analogues from the bloodstream (15Nielsen M.J.

Furthermore, it has been theorized that one of the two paralogs resulting from 2R was then lost in the teleost lineage (infraclass of the ray-finned fish Actinopterygii), whereas a tandem duplication further expanded that gene into HC and IF in the ancestor of Sarcopterygii (the lobe-finned fish, which are ancestral to Tetrapoda and therefore all land-dwelling vertebrates) (18Lopes-Marques M.

Zebrafish (Danio rerio) are a potentially powerful model system with which to study vitamin B12 metabolism and biology. Zebrafish produce large numbers of offspring, are easily housed, and are amenable to genetic manipulation. Fish develop from fertilized eggs to free-swimming larva in less than a week. During the majority of this time, the embryos are transparent, allowing development to be monitored in real time. To date, only a single cobalamin-carrier protein has been described in zebrafish (20Greibe E. Fedosov S. Nexo E. The cobalamin-binding protein in zebrafish is an intermediate between the three cobalamin-binding proteins in human.PLoS One. 2012; 7 (22532867)e3566010.1371/journal.pone.0035660Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Although it shares marginally higher amino acid similarity to tetrapod transcobalamin, it also displays properties that are characteristic of both HC and IF. For this reason, the protein was originally referred to as HIT (abbreviation of Haptocorrin, Intrinsic Factor, and Transcobalamin) and was thought to be more functionally similar to the ancestral carrier protein that duplicated and subfunctionalized into TC, HC, and IF (20Greibe E. Fedosov S. Nexo E. The cobalamin-binding protein in zebrafish is an intermediate between the three cobalamin-binding proteins in human.PLoS One. 2012; 7 (22532867)e3566010.1371/journal.pone.0035660Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). More recently, the gene that codes for this protein in zebrafish has been officially renamed tcn2 (Gene ID: 407646; NP_001116703) (18Lopes-Marques M. Ruivo R. Delgado I. Wilson J.M. Aluru N. Castro L.F.C. Basal gnathostomes provide unique insights into the evolution of vitamin B12 binders.Genome Biol.

To develop a zebrafish model of vitamin B12 deficiency, we created two lines of zebrafish carrying homozygous tcn2 knockout mutations. These tcn2−/− fish demonstrate no obvious developmental or behavioral phenotypes, which is inconsistent with models of vitamin B12 deficiency in mammals (as reviewed in Ref. 22Peng L. Dreumont N. Coelho D. Gueant J.L. Arnold C. Genetic animal models to decipher the pathogenic effects of vitamin B12 and folate deficiency.Biochimie. 2016; 126 (27178438): 43-5110.1016/j.biochi.2016.05.007Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) (24Yamada K.

New B vitamin recommendations in fish when fed plant-based diets.Aquaculture Nutr. 2015; 21: 507-52710.1111/anu.12342Crossref Scopus (35) Google Scholar), the benign effects of tcn2 knockout strongly suggests a compensatory, as yet undescribed, system of cobalamin transport in zebrafish. We have identified two putative proteins, Tcn-beta-a (Tcnba) (NP_001122207) and Tcn-beta-b (Tcnbb) (NP_001239578), that may be involved in such a compensatory system. Although homologous to Tcn2, these proteins are missing the α-domain associated with all other known cobalamin-carrier proteins; therefore, the bona fide nature of Tcnba and Tcnbb and their ability to bind cobalamin has been questioned without direct investigation by previous studies (18Lopes-Marques M. Ruivo R. Delgado I. Wilson J.M. Aluru N. Castro L.F.C. Basal gnathostomes provide unique insights into the evolution of vitamin B12 binders.Genome Biol.

In this study, we characterize the molecular and biochemical properties of zebrafish Tcnba and Tcnbb, demonstrating that they are able to bind cobalamin and are likely to provide a supporting role as cobalamin-carrier proteins. Despite the lack of an α-domain, these proteins bind cobalamin with an affinity approaching that of zebrafish Tcn2. Our findings shed light on the evolution of cobalamin-carrier proteins in nonmammalian species and demonstrate that the α-domain is not necessarily required for the ability to bind cobalamin. Single-guide RNAs (sgRNAs) were designed to target either the second or third exon of zebrafish tcn2 and injected into the yolk of fertilized eggs at the one-cell stage (Fig. S1A). Founder fish (F0) were outbred to WT fish and the resulting F1 progeny were inbred, 30 of which were screened for out-of-frame alleles. The founder fish chosen for the tcn2 exon 2 KO line possessed a 43-bp deletion/2-bp insertion overlapping the exon-intron boundary for exon 2. The resulting transcript is missing exon 2 (verified by RT-PCR and subsequent sequencing), which results in the presence of an early stop codon in the beginning of the fourth exon (Fig. S1B). The founder fish chosen for the tcn2 exon 3 KO line possessed a 51-bp deletion/4-bp insertion in exon 3, which results in the presence of an early stop codon at the end of the third exon (Fig. S1C). Both lines were bred to homozygosity and observed for developmental and behavioral phenotypes. For each of these characteristics, the homozygous null animals did not differ from each other and were indistinguishable from the WT fish. Genes encoding transcobalamin-like proteins in zebrafish, tcnba (also known as tcn1; Gene ID: 566714; NM_001128735) and tcnbb (also known as si:ch211-117m20.5; Gene ID: 566658; NM_001252649), have been identified by previous studies but have not been extensively characterized (18Lopes-Marques M.

Both of these genes are composed of four exons, and they are adjacent to one another on chromosome 5, separated by ∼2 kb of intergenic sequence. At the amino acid level, Tcnba and Tcnbb share 53% sequence identity and 68% sequence similarity, as measured by a Smith-Waterman local protein alignment. On an exon by exon basis, translated exons 2–4 in both zebrafish tcnba and tcnbb correspond to translated human TCN1 (gene encoding HC) exons 7, 8, and 9, respectively (Fig. 1), and the first exon from each of these genes encodes a predicted signal peptide for extracellular secretion. Exons 7–9 in human HC encode the β-domain (13Furger E. Frei D.C. Schibli R. Fischer E. Prota A.E.

To investigate the prevalence of β-domain–only cobalamin-carrier homologs, we queried the RefSeq database using PSI-BLAST for the human HC α- and β-domains separately, restricting our results to vertebrate sequences. Any proteins which contained an α-domain were filtered from the results, leaving 48 β-domain–only homologs representing 29 species (Table S1). Only 4 of the β-domain–only homologs belonged to species not within Actinopterygii, confirming that the α-domain has been widely conserved outside these ray-finned fish. The β-domains of all 430 sequences identified in the initial PSI-BLAST search were used to calculate a multiple sequence alignment, from which a maximum-likelihood phylogeny was inferred (Fig. 2). All of the β-domain–only Actinopterygii sequences formed a monophyletic clade separate from vertebrate TC, HC, and IF, indicating that these proteins (including zebrafish Tcnba and Tcnbb) represent a novel class of putative cobalamin-binding proteins; for this reason, we have elected to update the original gene names (tcn1 and si:ch211-117m20.5) to ensure that an orthologous relationship is not inferred between zebrafish tcn1 and human TCN1. We will refer to the genes in this orthogroup collectively as tcn-beta, or tcnb. The proteins encoded by the genes in this orthogroup span 26 ray-finned fish species in both the Holostei (spotted gar) and Teleostei lineages. Whereas the majority of tcnb sequences were found to encode a protein consisting of a single β-domain, seven sequences were identified as encoding a protein that consists of two fused β-domains. Five of the seven were identified in Protacanthopterygii (comprising both Salmoniformes and Esociformes); the remaining two were identified in Clupea harengus (Atlantic herring). Syntenic analyses suggest that tandem duplication may have played a role in the evolutionary development of these unique proteins. Four additional β-domain–only homologs were identified in select reptilian species, all of which grouped with vertebrate HC. Further exploration of these genes was outside of the scope of this study, however, because their phylogenetic placement clearly indicates that they are not members of the tcnbb orthogroup. The developmental expression patterns of zebrafish tcn2, tcnba, and tcnbb were analyzed using the Zebrafish ESTs track in the UCSC Genome Browser (31Kent W.J. Sugnet C.W. Furey T.S. Roskin K.M. Pringle T.H. Zahler A.M. Haussler D. The human genome browser at UCSC.Genome Res. 2002; 12 (12045153): 996-100610.1101/gr.229102Crossref PubMed Scopus (6721) Google Scholar). RNA-Seq libraries were found to contain abundant transcripts from these loci at multiple developmental stages. Time-course RNA-Seq data were obtained from the Expression Atlas server (32Petryszak R.

Collins J.E. Sealy I.M. Wali N. Dooley C.M. Digby Z. Stemple D.L. Murphy D.N. Billis K. Hourlier T. Fullgrabe A. Davis M.P. Enright A.J. Busch-Nentwich E.M.

The maternal to zygotic transition (MZT) occurs during the blastula period; therefore, any transcript present in the developing embryo prior to this stage is considered to be maternally loaded (34Tadros W. Lipshitz H.D. The maternal-to-zygotic transition: A play in two acts.Development. 2009; 136 (19700615): 3033-304210.1242/dev.033183Crossref PubMed Scopus (767) Google Scholar). These data demonstrated that tcn2 is a maternally loaded transcript, whereas tcnba and tcnbb are products of embryonic transcription. tcnbb is produced by the embryo at the onset of somitogenesis and tcnba is detectable by 3 dpf (Fig. 3A). RT-PCR was used to confirm the RNA-Seq results, using cDNA from WT TAB5 zebrafish embryos collected at various developmental stages ranging from four cells to 5 dpf (Fig. 3B). We then used whole-mount in situ hybridizations using embryos at 3 dpf and 5 dpf to determine spatial expression patterns of these transcripts (Fig. 4, A–I). At 3 dpf, tcn2 localized to the yolk syncytial layer, indicating a possible role in nutrient transport in the developing larva (Fig. 4A). At 5 dpf, expression of tcn2 was found to be concen"
https://openalex.org/W2889893053,"Age and cortical structure are both associated with cognition, but characterizing this relationship remains a challenge. A popular approach is to use functional network organization of the cortex as an organizing principle for post-hoc interpretations of structural results. In the current study, we introduce two complimentary approaches to structural analyses that are guided by a-priori functional network maps. Specifically, we systematically investigated the relationship of cortical structure (thickness and surface area) of distinct functional networks to two cognitive domains sensitive to age-related decline thought to rely on both common and distinct processes (executive function and episodic memory) in older adults. We quantified the cortical structure of individual functional network’s predictive ability and spatial extent (i.e., number of significant regions) with cognition and its mediating role in the age-cognition relationship. We found that cortical thickness, rather than surface area, predicted cognition across the majority of functional networks. The default mode and somatomotor network emerged as particularly important as they appeared to be the only two networks to mediate the age-cognition relationship for both cognitive domains. In contrast, thickness of the salience network predicted executive function and mediated the age-cognition relationship for executive function. These relationships remained significant even after accounting for global cortical thickness. Quantifying the number of regions related to cognition and mediating the age-cognition relationship yielded similar patterns of results. This study provides a potential approach to organize and describe the apparent widespread regional cortical structural relationships with cognition and age in older adults."

https://openalex.org/W2891099839,"Pseudomonas aeruginosa is an opportunistic human pathogen that causes nosocomial infections. The P. aeruginosa outer membrane contains specific porins that enable substrate uptake, with the outer membrane protein OprG facilitating transport of small, uncharged amino acids. However, the pore size of an eight-stranded β-barrel monomer of OprG is too narrow to accommodate even the smallest transported amino acid, glycine, raising the question of how OprG facilitates amino acid uptake. Pro-92 of OprG is critically important for amino acid transport, with a P92A substitution inhibiting transport and the NMR structure of this variant revealing that this substitution produces structural changes in the barrel rim and restricts loop motions. OprG may assemble into oligomers in the outer membrane (OM) whose subunit interfaces could form a transport channel. Here, we explored the contributions of the oligomeric state and the extracellular loops to OprG’s function. Using chemical cross-linking to determine the oligomeric structures of both WT and P92A OprG in native outer membranes and atomic force microscopy, and single-molecule fluorescence of the purified proteins reconstituted into lipid bilayers, we found that both protein variants form oligomers, supporting the notion that subunit interfaces in the oligomer could provide a pathway for amino acid transport. Furthermore, performing transport assays with loop-deleted OprG variants, we found that these variants also can transport small amino acids, indicating that the loops are not solely responsible for substrate transport. We propose that OprG functions as an oligomer and that conformational changes in the barrel–loop region might be crucial for its activity.

https://openalex.org/W2891462236,"Jatropha curcas is an oil-rich seed crop with huge potentials for bioenergy production. The inflorescence carries a number of processes that are likely to affect the overall yield potentials; floral development, male-to-female flower ratio, floral abscission and fruit set. In this study, a weighted gene co-expression network analysis which integrates the transcriptome, physical and simple sugar data of J. curcas inflorescence was performed and nine modules were identified by means of hierarchical clustering. Among them, four modules (green4, antiquewhite2, brown2 and lightskyblue4) showed significant correlation to yield factors at p≤0.01. The four modules are categorized into two clusters; cluster 1 of green4 and antiquewhite2 modules correspond to number of flowers/inflorescence, total seed weight/plant, number of seeds/plant, and number of fruits/plant, whereas cluster 2 of brown2 and lightskyblue4 modules correspond to glucose and fructose. Descriptive characterizations of cluster 1 show putative involvement in gibberellin signaling and responses, whereas cluster 2 may have been involved in sugar signaling, signal transductions and regulation of flowerings. Our findings present a list of hub genes for J. curcas yield improvement and reproductive biology enhancement strategies."

https://openalex.org/W2891769209,"Patients with chronic heart failure have alteration in body composition as a reduction in fat mass, lean body mass and bone mass. However, body wasting in valvular heart disease and the impact of corrective valvular surgery on body composition has not been investigated.We hypothesized that body wasting in severe mitral valve (MV) diseases is reversible through MV surgery.Forty eight patients who were scheduled to undergo MV surgery were consecutively enrolled after excluding patients with combined valvular heart disease, ischemic heart disease, cardiomyopathies, and diseases or who were taking medications that could affect metabolism. All patients were subjected to simplified nutritional assessment questionnaire (SNAQ) for appetite, laboratory tests, echocardiography, and dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) before and one year after MV surgery.One year after MV surgery, the patients showed increased appetite and improved laboratory data as well as hemodynamic improvement.When we classified the patients according to the primary MV lesion, no changes in body weight were observed in both patients with mitral regurgitation (MR) and mitral stenosis (MS). However, significant increase in bone mineral density and body fat percentage were observed in patients with MR and not in patients with MS. In patients with MR, patients with Δfat ≥ 2% showed significantly higher pre-operative estimated right ventricular systolic pressure (eRVSP) level and greater decrease in eRVSP after surgery than those with Δfat < 2% and both ΔSNAQ and Δfat showed significant negative relationship with ΔeRVSP, respectively.In patients with severe MV disease, corrective MV surgery led to favorable outcomes in wasting process as well as hemodynamic improvement. Particularly, right ventricular pressure overload showed a close association with the changes in appetite and body fat percentage in patients with MR."
https://openalex.org/W2890720686,"It has recently been demonstrated that moderate adult onset caloric restriction (e.g. calorie restriction; CR) has a positive impact on female fertility in aged mice, due in large to preventing the age-associated decline in the quality of oocytes available for fertilization. The impact of CR on oocyte quality has been attributed, at least in part, to mitochondrial functions. In mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) mutator mice (PolgD257A/D257A), which harbor a mutation in the proofreading mtDNA polymerase-gamma (POLG), mitochondrial mutations rapidly accumulate, resulting in a premature aging phenotype and female infertility. As CR has been shown to extend both lifespan and 'healthspan' as well as improve oocyte quality in aged mice, we investigated whether adult onset CR could improve oocyte quality in the POLG mouse. Female PolgD257A/D257A mice exhibited infertility based on an inability to produce litters through natural mating. Analysis of oocytes from 8-9-month-old PolgD257A/D257A mice on CR following hormone stimulation revealed no improvement in the number of oocytes ovulated. Furthermore, CR did not result in a greater percentage of metaphase II oocytes, with the majority of the oocytes prematurely arrested at the germinal vesicle stage. Finally, CR did not improve the abnormal mitochondrial distribution or pronounced defects in meiotic spindle assembly and chromosomal distribution observed in the ad libitum fed PolgD257A/D257A. Taken together, these data suggest that although CR benefits oocyte quality and fertility outcomes in naturally aged female mice, it does not sufficiently improve oocyte quality in PolgD257A/D257A."
