https://openalex.org/W2904803926,"Neoantigens, which are derived from tumour-specific protein-coding mutations, are exempt from central tolerance, can generate robust immune responses1,2 and can function as bona fide antigens that facilitate tumour rejection3. Here we demonstrate that a strategy that uses multi-epitope, personalized neoantigen vaccination, which has previously been tested in patients with high-risk melanoma4–6, is feasible for tumours such as glioblastoma, which typically have a relatively low mutation load1,7 and an immunologically ‘cold’ tumour microenvironment8. We used personalized neoantigen-targeting vaccines to immunize patients newly diagnosed with glioblastoma following surgical resection and conventional radiotherapy in a phase I/Ib study. Patients who did not receive dexamethasone—a highly potent corticosteroid that is frequently prescribed to treat cerebral oedema in patients with glioblastoma—generated circulating polyfunctional neoantigen-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses that were enriched in a memory phenotype and showed an increase in the number of tumour-infiltrating T cells. Using single-cell T cell receptor analysis, we provide evidence that neoantigen-specific T cells from the peripheral blood can migrate into an intracranial glioblastoma tumour. Neoantigen-targeting vaccines thus have the potential to favourably alter the immune milieu of glioblastoma. Neoantigen-targeting vaccines are a feasible therapy for tumours with a low mutation burden and immunologically ‘cold’ tumour microenvironment, as neoantigen-specific T cells from the peripheral blood migrate into intracranial glioblastoma, thereby altering the immune milieu of the glioblastoma."
https://openalex.org/W2904210127,"Patients with glioblastoma currently do not sufficiently benefit from recent breakthroughs in cancer treatment that use checkpoint inhibitors1,2. For treatments using checkpoint inhibitors to be successful, a high mutational load and responses to neoepitopes are thought to be essential3. There is limited intratumoural infiltration of immune cells4 in glioblastoma and these tumours contain only 30–50 non-synonymous mutations5. Exploitation of the full repertoire of tumour antigens—that is, both unmutated antigens and neoepitopes—may offer more effective immunotherapies, especially for tumours with a low mutational load. Here, in the phase I trial GAPVAC-101 of the Glioma Actively Personalized Vaccine Consortium (GAPVAC), we integrated highly individualized vaccinations with both types of tumour antigens into standard care to optimally exploit the limited target space for patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma. Fifteen patients with glioblastomas positive for human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-A*02:01 or HLA-A*24:02 were treated with a vaccine (APVAC1) derived from a premanufactured library of unmutated antigens followed by treatment with APVAC2, which preferentially targeted neoepitopes. Personalization was based on mutations and analyses of the transcriptomes and immunopeptidomes of the individual tumours. The GAPVAC approach was feasible and vaccines that had poly-ICLC (polyriboinosinic-polyribocytidylic acid-poly-l-lysine carboxymethylcellulose) and granulocyte–macrophage colony-stimulating factor as adjuvants displayed favourable safety and strong immunogenicity. Unmutated APVAC1 antigens elicited sustained responses of central memory CD8+ T cells. APVAC2 induced predominantly CD4+ T cell responses of T helper 1 type against predicted neoepitopes. In a phase I trial, highly individualized peptide vaccines against unmutated tumour antigens and neoepitopes elicited sustained responses in CD8+ and CD4+ T cells, respectively, in patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma."

https://openalex.org/W2905500176,"Although abundant in organic molecules, carbon–hydrogen (C–H) bonds are typically considered unreactive and unavailable for chemical manipulation. Recent advances in C–H functionalization technology have begun to transform this logic, while emphasizing the importance of and challenges associated with selective alkylation at a sp3 carbon1,2. Here we describe iron-based catalysts for the enantio-, regio- and chemoselective intermolecular alkylation of sp3 C–H bonds through carbene C–H insertion. The catalysts, derived from a cytochrome P450 enzyme in which the native cysteine axial ligand has been substituted for serine (cytochrome P411), are fully genetically encoded and produced in bacteria, where they can be tuned by directed evolution for activity and selectivity. That these proteins activate iron, the most abundant transition metal, to perform this chemistry provides a desirable alternative to noble-metal catalysts, which have dominated the field of C–H functionalization1,2. The laboratory-evolved enzymes functionalize diverse substrates containing benzylic, allylic or α-amino C–H bonds with high turnover and excellent selectivity. Furthermore, they have enabled the development of concise routes to several natural products. The use of the native iron-haem cofactor of these enzymes to mediate sp3 C–H alkylation suggests that diverse haem proteins could serve as potential catalysts for this abiological transformation, and will facilitate the development of new enzymatic C–H functionalization reactions for applications in chemistry and synthetic biology. Evolved iron-containing enzymes based on cytochrome P450 achieve selective intermolecular alkylation of sp3 C–H bonds through a carbene C–H insertion strategy."
https://openalex.org/W2904334411,"Environmental cues profoundly affect cellular plasticity in multicellular organisms. For instance, exercise promotes a glycolytic-to-oxidative fibre-type switch in skeletal muscle, and cold acclimation induces beige adipocyte biogenesis in adipose tissue. However, the molecular mechanisms by which physiological or pathological cues evoke developmental plasticity remain incompletely understood. Here we report a type of beige adipocyte that has a critical role in chronic cold adaptation in the absence of β-adrenergic receptor signalling. This beige fat is distinct from conventional beige fat with respect to developmental origin and regulation, and displays enhanced glucose oxidation. We therefore refer to it as glycolytic beige fat. Mechanistically, we identify GA-binding protein α as a regulator of glycolytic beige adipocyte differentiation through a myogenic intermediate. Our study reveals a non-canonical adaptive mechanism by which thermal stress induces progenitor cell plasticity and recruits a distinct form of thermogenic cell that is required for energy homeostasis and survival. The mouse develops a developmentally and functionally distinct, non-canonical beige fat cell type as an adaptation to cold ambient temperature."
https://openalex.org/W3102263861,"It is predicted that the spectrum of radio emission from the whole sky should show a dip arising from the action of the light from the first stars on the hydrogen atoms in the surrounding gas, which causes the 21-cm line to appear in absorption against the cosmic microwave background. Bowman et al. 2018 identified a broad flat-bottomed absorption profile centred at 78 MHz, which could be this feature, although the depth of the profile is much larger than expected. We have examined the modelling process they used and find that their data implies unphysical parameters for the foreground emission and also that their solution is not unique in the sense that we found other simple formulations for the signal that are different in shape but that also fit their data. We argue that this calls into question the interpretation of these data as an unambiguous detection of the cosmological 21-cm absorption signature."
https://openalex.org/W2904947448,"Specificity of interactions between two DNA strands, or between protein and DNA, is often achieved by varying bases or side chains coming off the DNA or protein backbone—for example, the bases participating in Watson–Crick pairing in the double helix, or the side chains contacting DNA in TALEN–DNA complexes. By contrast, specificity of protein–protein interactions usually involves backbone shape complementarity1, which is less modular and hence harder to generalize. Coiled-coil heterodimers are an exception, but the restricted geometry of interactions across the heterodimer interface (primarily at the heptad a and d positions2) limits the number of orthogonal pairs that can be created simply by varying side-chain interactions3,4. Here we show that protein–protein interaction specificity can be achieved using extensive and modular side-chain hydrogen-bond networks. We used the Crick generating equations5 to produce millions of four-helix backbones with varying degrees of supercoiling around a central axis, identified those accommodating extensive hydrogen-bond networks, and used Rosetta to connect pairs of helices with short loops and to optimize the remainder of the sequence. Of 97 such designs expressed in Escherichia coli, 65 formed constitutive heterodimers, and the crystal structures of four designs were in close agreement with the computational models and confirmed the designed hydrogen-bond networks. In cells, six heterodimers were fully orthogonal, and in vitro—following mixing of 32 chains from 16 heterodimer designs, denaturation in 5 M guanidine hydrochloride and reannealing—almost all of the interactions observed by native mass spectrometry were between the designed cognate pairs. The ability to design orthogonal protein heterodimers should enable sophisticated protein-based control logic for synthetic biology, and illustrates that nature has not fully explored the possibilities for programmable biomolecular interaction modalities. Computational design incorporating modular buried hydrogen networks produces highly orthogonal protein heterodimers."
https://openalex.org/W2905426112,"A defining feature of adaptive immunity is the development of long-lived memory T cells to curtail infection. Recent studies have identified a unique stem-like T-cell subset amongst exhausted CD8-positive T cells in chronic infection1-3, but it remains unclear whether CD4-positive T-cell subsets with similar features exist in chronic inflammatory conditions. Amongst helper T cells, TH17 cells have prominent roles in autoimmunity and tissue inflammation and are characterized by inherent plasticity4-7, although how such plasticity is regulated is poorly understood. Here we demonstrate that TH17 cells in a mouse model of autoimmune disease are functionally and metabolically heterogeneous; they contain a subset with stemness-associated features but lower anabolic metabolism, and a reciprocal subset with higher metabolic activity that supports transdifferentiation into TH1-like cells. These two TH17-cell subsets are defined by selective expression of the transcription factors TCF-1 and T-bet, and by discrete levels of CD27 expression. We also identify signalling via the kinase complex mTORC1 as a central regulator of TH17-cell fate decisions by coordinating metabolic and transcriptional programmes. TH17 cells with disrupted mTORC1 signalling or anabolic metabolism fail to induce autoimmune neuroinflammation or to develop into TH1-like cells, but instead upregulate TCF-1 expression and acquire stemness-associated features. Single-cell RNA sequencing and experimental validation reveal heterogeneity in fate-mapped TH17 cells, and a developmental arrest in the TH1 transdifferentiation trajectory upon loss of mTORC1 activity or metabolic perturbation. Our results establish that the dichotomy of stemness and effector function underlies the heterogeneous TH17 responses and autoimmune pathogenesis, and point to previously unappreciated metabolic control of plasticity in helper T cells."

https://openalex.org/W2904841654,"Soil erosion is a multifactor threat to crop production and the environment. Most studies on soil erosion characterization have not focused on soil nutrient loss associated with erosion. The aim of this study was therefore to quantify the magnitude of nutrient loss through soil erosion under different cropping systems and amendments to inform agronomic practices in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). A field experiment was carried out on runoff plots with different cropping systems (sole maize, sole cowpea, sole maize and maize intercropped with soybean) as main plots and soil amendments (biochar, NPK (Nitrogen +Phosphorus +Potassium) fertilizer, NPK + biochar and a control (no amendment)) constituting the subplots in a randomized complete block design. For each block, a bare plot was included to assess the efficiency of the different crop and soil management practices on soil erosion. The study was carried out in three consecutive cropping seasons in the semi-deciduous forest zone of Ghana. The bare plots had the highest amounts of nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and potassium (K) eroded: 33.88, 12.35 and 12.75 kg ha-1 respectively followed by the control plots with magnitude of 20.43, 8.42 and 7.87 kg ha-1 respectively for N, P and K. Sole maize had the highest amounts of nutrient loss: 19.71, 8.12 and 7.27 for N, P and K respectively compared to all the other cropping systems where the losses varied respectively from 12.38 to 17.12, 6.67 to 7.49 and 5.81 to 6.75 kg ha-1 The legume-based cropping systems under inorganic fertilizer and biochar management effectively reduced nutrient loss more than all other treatment combinations. The off-site effect of soil erosion expressed as enrichment ratio (ER) was higher for all plots, which received inorganic fertilizer inputs varying from 1.93 to 3.06 while the other treatments had ERs of 1.51 to 2.03. The ERs of fine soil particles were greater than 1 (ranging from 1.14 to 3.6) being relatively higher than that of coarse particles (sand) with values below 1 (ranging from 0.62 to 0.88). The least cumulative monetary value of nutrient loss (30.82 US$ ha-1) was observed under cowpea cropping system which received NPK + BC treatment. Soil erosion affected directly soil nutrient depletion through nutrient loss; however, integrated soil fertility management associated with legume-based cropping systems can be alternative options to reducing its effects on croplands in SSA."

https://openalex.org/W2904099822,"Alternative splicing is dysregulated in cancer cells, driving the production of isoforms that allow tumor cells to survive and continuously proliferate. Part of the reactivation of telomerase involves the splicing of hTERT transcripts to produce full-length (FL) TERT. Very few splicing factors to date have been described to interact with hTERT and promote the production of FL TERT. We recently described one such splicing factor, NOVA1, that acts as an enhancer of FL hTERT splicing, increases telomerase activity, and promotes telomere maintenance in cancer cells. NOVA1 is expressed primarily in neurons and is involved in neurogenesis. In the present studies, we describe that polypyrimidine-tract binding proteins (PTBPs), which are also typically involved in neurogenesis, are also participating in the splicing of hTERT to FL in cancer. Knockdown experiments of PTBP1 in cancer cells indicate that PTBP1 reduces hTERT FL splicing and telomerase activity. Stable knockdown of PTBP1 results in progressively shortened telomere length in H1299 and H920 lung cancer cells. RNA pulldown experiments reveal that PTBP1 interacts with hTERT pre-mRNA in a NOVA1 dependent fashion. Knockdown of PTBP1 increases the expression of PTBP2 which also interacts with NOVA1, potentially preventing the association of NOVA1 with hTERT pre-mRNA. These new data highlight that splicing in cancer cells is regulated by competition for splice sites and that combinations of splicing factors interact at cis regulatory sites on pre-mRNA transcripts. By employing hTERT as a model gene, we show the coordination of the splicing factors NOVA1 and PTBP1 in cancer by regulating telomerase that is expressed in the vast majority of cancer cell types."
https://openalex.org/W2903695230,"Identifying the causes of historical trends in relative sea level-the height of the sea surface relative to Earth's crust-is a prerequisite for predicting future changes. Rates of change along the eastern coast of the USA (the US East Coast) during the past century were spatially variable, and relative sea level rose faster along the Mid-Atlantic Bight than along the South Atlantic Bight and the Gulf of Maine. Past studies suggest that Earth's ongoing response to the last deglaciation1-5, surface redistribution of ice and water5-9 and changes in ocean circulation9-13 contributed considerably to this large-scale spatial pattern. Here we analyse instrumental data14,15 and proxy reconstructions4,12 using probabilistic methods16-18 to show that vertical motions of Earth's crust exerted the dominant control on regional spatial differences in relative sea-level trends along the US East Coast during 1900-2017, explaining most of the large-scale spatial variance. Rates of coastal subsidence caused by ongoing relaxation of the peripheral forebulge associated with the last deglaciation are strongest near North Carolina, Maryland and Virginia. Such structure indicates that Earth's elastic lithosphere is thicker than has been assumed in other models19-22. We also find a substantial coastal gradient in relative sea-level trends over this period that is unrelated to deglaciation and suggests contributions from twentieth-century redistribution of ice and water. Our results indicate that the majority of large-scale spatial variation in long-term rates of relative sea-level rise on the US East Coast is due to geological processes that will persist at similar rates for centuries."

https://openalex.org/W2903875928,"Interactions between secreted immune proteins called chemokines and their cognate G protein–coupled receptors regulate the trafficking of leukocytes in inflammatory responses. The two-site, two-step model describes these interactions. It involves initial binding of the chemokine N-loop/β3 region to the receptor's N-terminal region and subsequent insertion of the chemokine N-terminal region into the transmembrane helical bundle of the receptor concurrent with receptor activation. Here, we test aspects of this model with C-C motif chemokine receptor 1 (CCR1) and several chemokine ligands. First, we compared the chemokine-binding affinities of CCR1 with those of peptides corresponding to the CCR1 N-terminal region. Relatively low affinities of the peptides and poor correlations between CCR1 and peptide affinities indicated that other regions of the receptor may contribute to binding affinity. Second, we evaluated the contributions of the two CCR1-interacting regions of the cognate chemokine ligand CCL7 (formerly monocyte chemoattractant protein-3 (MCP-3)) using chimeras between CCL7 and the non-cognate ligand CCL2 (formerly MCP-1). The results revealed that the chemokine N-terminal region contributes significantly to binding affinity but that differences in binding affinity do not completely account for differences in receptor activation. On the basis of these observations, we propose an elaboration of the two-site, two-step model—the “three-step” model—in which initial interactions of the first site result in low-affinity, nonspecific binding; rate-limiting engagement of the second site enables high-affinity, specific binding; and subsequent conformational rearrangement gives rise to receptor activation.

https://openalex.org/W2905945365,"Antiviral drug development against respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is urgently needed due to the public health significance of the viral infection. Here, we report the anti-RSV activity of a small molecule, (1S,3R,4R,5R)-3,4- bis{[(E)-3-(3,4-dihydroxyphenyl)prop-2-enoyl]oxy}-1,5-dihydroxycyclohexane-1-carboxylic methyl ester (3,4-DCQAME) or 3,4- O-Dicaffeoylquinic acid methyl ester, which can be isolated from several plants of traditional Chinese medicine. We showed for the first time that compound 3,4-DCQAME potently inhibits RSV entry and infection. In vitro, 3,4-DCQAME can interact with F(ecto), the ectodomain of RSV fusion (F) protein. In cultured cells, the compound can block the interaction of F(ecto) protein with the cellular membrane and inhibit viral fusion during RSV entry, leading to inhibition of viral gene expression and infection. In RSV-infected mice that were treated with 3,4-DCQAME, we observed a reduction of RSV-induced pathologic changes and substantial inhibition of viral infection and growth in the lung tissues. Our results provide the first direct evidence of the anti-RSV activity of 3,4-DCQAME. Furthermore, these results suggest that 3,4-DCQAME represents a promising lead compound for anti-RSV therapeutic development.-Tang, W., Li, M., Liu, Y., Liang, N., Yang, Z., Zhao, Y., Wu, S., Lu, S., Li, Y., Liu, F.

https://openalex.org/W2903672000,"Identifying patients with rare diseases associated with common symptoms is challenging. Hunter syndrome, or Mucopolysaccharidosis type II is a progressive rare disease caused by a deficiency in the activity of the lysosomal enzyme, iduronate 2-sulphatase. It is inherited in an X-linked manner resulting in males being significantly affected. Expression in females varies with the majority being unaffected although symptoms may emerge over time. We developed a Naïve Bayes classification (NBC) algorithm utilizing the clinical diagnosis and symptoms of patients contained within their de-identified and unstructured electronic medical records (EMR) extracted by the Canadian Primary Care Sentinel Surveillance Network (CPCSSN). To do so, we created a training dataset using published results in the scientific literature and from all MPS II symptoms and applied the training dataset and its independent features to compute the conditional posterior probabilities of having MPS II disease as a categorical dependent variable for 506497 male patients. The classifier identified 125 patients with the highest likelihood for having the disease and 18 features were selected to be necessary for forecasting. Next, a Recursive Backward Feature Elimination algorithm was employed, for optimal input features of the NBC model, using a k-fold Cross-Validation with 3 replicates. The accuracy of the final model was estimated by the Validation Set Approach technique and the bootstrap resampling. We also investigated that whether the NBC is as accurate as three other Bayesian networks. The Naïve Bayes Classifier appears to be an efficient algorithm in assisting physicians with the diagnosis of Hunter syndrome allowing optimal patient management."

Method This cross-sectional study included 15 piano students. The research tools included 3D motion capture, anthropometric measurements, and questionnaires for obtaining data about MSD, psychological, and personal factors. Results The piano students recruited for this study experienced a variety of MSD during the past 12 months, with a particularly high prevalence of neck pain (80%). Extreme wrist extension and/or elbow flexion while playing the piano also correlated with MSD. Additionally, this study identified correlations between MSD and hand span (r = -.69, p≤.004) and number of playing hours per week (r = .58, p≤.024). Conclusions Anthropometric factors and playing patterns should be considered together with well-known MSD risk factors, like extreme and repetitive movements. However, considering each joint singularly might not be sufficient to prevent the development of MSD when instructing the piano player; accordingly, joint synchronization should also be considered."

We assessed the current status of PAH in the Korean population. The Health Insurance Review and Assessment Service (HIRA) claim database, which comprises nationwide medical insurance data of Koreans from 2008-2016, was assessed to determine the current status of PAH. Overall, 1,307 patients were newly diagnosed with PAH from 2008-2016 (0.0005%, annual incidence: 4.84 patients/1 million people/year). The mean age at diagnosis was 44±13 years (range 18-65) and patients were mostly women (n = 906, 69.3%). Cases of idiopathic PAH (51.6%) accounted for the largest proportion, followed by acquired PAH (APAH) associated with congenital heart disease (25.8%) and APAH with connective tissue disease (17.2%). Overall, 807 (61.7%) patients received a single PAH-specific treatment based on their last prescription, of which bosentan (50.6%) was the most frequently used. Only 240 (18.4%) patients received combination therapy, with the bosentan-beraprost combination (32.9%) being the most common. During the mean follow-up of 1.9 years, the 1-, 2-, 3-, and 5-year estimated survival rates were 85%, 62%, 54%, and 46%, respectively. The prevalence and incidence of PAH in the Korean population is currently comparable with that in previous registries. The 5-year survival rate was slightly higher in the Korean population than previously reported."
https://openalex.org/W2904325568,"The heat shock response (HSR) pathway is a highly conserved cellular stress response and mediated by its master regulator HSF1. Activation of the pathway results in the expression of chaperone proteins (heat shock proteins; HSP) to maintain protein homeostasis. One of the genes strongest upregulated upon stress is HSPA1A (HSP72). Heavy metals are highly toxic to living organisms and known as environmental contaminants, due to industrialisation. Furthermore, many of them are well-described inducers of the HSR pathway. Here we compare the effect of different heavy metals, concerning their potential to activate HSF1 with a sensitive artificial heat shock reporter cell line, consisting of heat shock elements (HSE). In general the responses of the artificial promoter to heavy metal stress were in good agreement with those of well-established HSF1 target genes, like HSPA1A. Nevertheless, differences were observable when effects of heat and heavy metal stress were compared. Whereas heat stress preferentially activated the HSE promoter, heavy metals more strongly induced the HSPA1A promoter. We therefore analysed the HSPA1A promoter in more detail, by isolating and mutating the HSEs. The results indicate that the importance of the individual binding sites for HSF1 is determined by their sequence similarity to the consensus sequence and their position relative to the transcription start site, but they were not differentially affected by heat or heavy metal stress. In contrast, we found that other parts of the HSPA1A promoter have different impact on the response under different stress conditions. In this work we provide deeper insights into the regulation of HSP72 expression as a well as a method to quantitatively and sensitively evaluate different stressor on their potential to activate HSF1."
https://openalex.org/W2903944587,"Social networks have become ubiquitous in modern society, which makes social network monitoring a research area of significant practical importance. Social network data consist of social interactions between pairs of individuals that are temporally aggregated over a certain interval of time, and the level of such temporal aggregation can have substantial impact on social network monitoring. There have been several studies on the effect of temporal aggregation in the process monitoring literature, but no studies on the effect of temporal aggregation in social network monitoring. We use the degree corrected stochastic block model (DCSBM) to simulate social networks and network anomalies and analyze these networks in the context of both count and binary network data. In conjunction with this model, we use the Priebe scan method as the monitoring method. We demonstrate that temporal aggregation at high levels leads to a considerable decrease in the ability to detect an anomaly within a specified time period. Moreover, converting social network communication data from counts to binary indicators can result in a significant loss of information, hindering detection performance. Aggregation at an appropriate level with count data, however, can amplify the anomalous signal generated by network anomalies and improve detection performance. Our results provide both insights on the practical effects of temporal aggregation and a framework for the study of other combinations of network models, surveillance methods, and types of anomalies."
https://openalex.org/W2905506504,"Background Quality Improvement (QI) approaches are increasingly used to bridge the quality gap in maternal and newborn care (MNC) in Sub Saharan Africa. Health workers typically serve as both recipients and implementers of QI activities; their understanding, motivation, and level of involvement largely determining the potential effect. In support of efforts to harmonise and integrate the various QI approaches implemented in parallel in Tanzanian health facilities, our objective was to investigate how different components of a collaborative QI intervention were understood and experienced by health workers, and therefore contributed positively to its mechanisms of effect. Materials and methods A qualitative process evaluation of a collaborative QI intervention for MNC in rural Tanzania was carried out. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 16 health workers in 13 purposively sampled health facilities. A deductive theory-driven qualitative content analysis was employed using the integrated Promoting Action on Research Implementation in Health services (i-PARIHS) framework as a lens with its four constructs innovation, recipients, facilitation, and context as guiding themes. Results Health workers valued the high degree of fit between QI topics and their everyday practice and appreciated the intervention’s comprehensive approach. The use of run-charts to monitor progress was well understood and experienced as motivating. The importance and positive experience of on-site mentoring and coaching visits to individual health facilities was expressed by the majority of health workers. Many described the parallel implementation of various health programs as a challenge. Conclusion Components of QI approaches that are well understood and experienced as supportive by health workers in everyday practice may enhance mechanisms of effect and result in more significant change. A focus on such components may also guide harmonisation, to avoid duplication and the implementation of parallel programs, and country ownership of QI approaches in resource limited settings."

High levels of ZIKV RNA were, however, also detected in mice and non-human primates in organs other than the brain, such as the liver. As ZIKV is a flavivirus closely related to the dengue and yellow fever virus, which are known to cause hepatitis, we here examined whether human hepatocytes are susceptible to ZIKV infection. We demonstrated that both human pluripotent stem cell (hPSC)-derived hepatocyte-like cells (HLCs) and the Huh7 hepatoma cell line support the complete ZIKV replication cycle. Of three antiviral molecules that inhibit ZIKV infection in Vero cells, only 7-deaza-2'-C-methyladenosine (7DMA) inhibited ZIKV replication in hPSC-HLCs, while all drugs inhibited ZIKV infection in Huh7 cells. ZIKV-infected hPSC-HLCs but not Huh7 cells mounted an innate immune and NFκβ response, which may explain the more extensive cytopathic effect observed in Huh7 cells. In conclusion, ZIKV productively infects human hepatocytes in vitro. However, significant differences in the innate immune response against ZIKV and antiviral drug sensitivity were observed when comparing hPSC-HLCs and hepatoma cells, highlighting the need to assess ZIKV infection as well as antiviral activity not only in hepatoma cells, but also in more physiologically relevant systems."
https://openalex.org/W2903924764,"Nuclear receptor tyrosine kinases (nRTKs) are aberrantly upregulated in many types of cancers, but the regulation of nRTK remains unclear. We previously showed androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) induces nMET in castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) specimens. Through gene expression microarray profiles reanalysis, we identified that nMET signaling requires ARF for CRPC growth in Pten/Trp53 conditional knockout mouse model. Accordingly, aberrant MET/nMET elevation correlates with ARF in human prostate cancer (PCa) specimens. Mechanistically, ARF elevates nMET through binding to MET cytoplasmic domain to stabilize MET. Furthermore, carbon nanodots resensitize cancer cells to MET inhibitors through DNA damage response. The inhibition of phosphorylation by carbon nanodots was identified through binding to phosphate group of phospho-tyrosine via computational calculation and experimental assay. Thus, nMET is essential to precision therapy of MET inhibitor. Our findings reveal for the first time that targeting nMET axis by carbon nanodots can be a novel avenue for overcoming drug resistance in cancers especially prostate cancer."

Very few studies, however, have investigated for volumetric abnormalities in the thalamus in patients with PD. Furthermore, to the best of our knowledge, no previous study has investigated for shape abnormalities in the thalamus in patients with PD. Twenty-five patients with PD and 25 HC participants (all female) were recruited for the study. A voxel-wise volume comparison analysis and a vertex-wise shape analysis were conducted to evaluate structural abnormalities in the PD patients compared to HC. The patients with PD demonstrated significant gray matter volume reductions in the thalamus bilaterally, relative to the HC.

However, the signaling pathways underlying benzene-induced hematotoxicity remain to be defined. Here, we investigated the role of protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) in the regulation of benzene-induced hematotoxicity in a murine model. Male mice with a hepatocyte-specific homozygous deletion of the Ppp2r1a gene (encoding PP2A Aα subunit) (HO) and matched wildtype (WT) mice were exposed to benzene via inhalation at doses of 1, 10, and 100 ppm for 28 days. Peripheral white blood cell counts and activation of bone marrow progenitors were attenuated in the HO mice, indicating that Ppp2r1a deletion protects against benzene-induced hematotoxicity. Moreover, elevation of urinary S-phenyl mercapturic acid, a benzene metabolite, was much greater in WT mice than in HO mice. Real-time exhalation analysis revealed more exhaled benzene but fewer benzene metabolites in HO mice than in WT mice, possibly because of the down-regulation of Cyp2e1, encoding cytochrome P4502E1, in hepatocytes of the HO mice. Loss-of-function screening disclosed that PP2A complexes containing the B56α subunit participate in regulating Cyp2e1 expression. Notably, PP2A–B56α suppression in HepG2 cells resulted in persistent β-catenin phosphorylation at Ser33-Ser37-Thr41 in response to CYP2E1 agonists. In parallel, nuclear translocation of β-catenin was inhibited, concomitant with a remarkable decrease of Cyp2e1 expression. These findings support the notion that a regulatory cascade comprising PP2A–B56α, β-catenin, and Cyp2e1 is involved in benzene-induced hematotoxicity, providing critical insight into the role of PP2A in responses to the environmental chemicals.

https://openalex.org/W2903634840,"The ability to persist in the absence of growth triggered by low oxygen levels is a critical process for the survival of mycobacterial species in many environmental niches. MSMEG_5243 (fsq), a gene of unknown function in Mycobacterium smegmatis, is up-regulated in response to hypoxia and regulated by DosRDosS/DosT, an oxygen- and redox-sensing two-component system that is highly conserved in mycobacteria. In this communication, we demonstrate that MSMEG_5243 is a flavin-sequestering protein and henceforth refer to it as Fsq. Using an array of biochemical and structural analyses, we show that Fsq is a member of the diverse superfamily of flavin- and deazaflavin-dependent oxidoreductases (FDORs) and is widely distributed in mycobacterial species. We created a markerless deletion mutant of fsq and demonstrate that fsq is required for cell survival during hypoxia. Using fsq deletion and overexpression, we found that fsq enhances cellular resistance to hydrogen peroxide treatment. The X-ray crystal structure of Fsq, solved to 2.7 Å, revealed a homodimeric organization with FAD bound noncovalently. The Fsq structure also uncovered no potential substrate-binding cavities, as the FAD is fully enclosed, and electrochemical studies indicated that the Fsq:FAD complex is relatively inert and does not share common properties with electron-transfer proteins. Taken together, our results suggest that Fsq reduces the formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) by sequestering free FAD during recovery from hypoxia, thereby protecting the cofactor from undergoing autoxidation to produce ROS.

Mycobacteria are obligately aerobic bacteria that are able to survive prolonged periods of hypoxia and nutrient limitation. One of the key challenges for mycobacterial persistence during hypoxia is combating the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) 4The abbreviations used are: ROSreactive oxygen speciesFDORflavin/deazaflavin oxidoreductaseSSNsequence similarity networkqPCRquantitative PCRVCvector controlFMNflavin mononucleotideLBTlysogeny broth with 0.05% Tween 80HdBHartmans de BontTEVtobacco etch virusSECsize-exclusion chromatography. during re-entry into aerobic conditions and ensuing growth. The majority of ROS production in mycobacterial cells is generated through the autoxidation of molecules with sufficient electrochemical potential to form superoxide (1Miller D.M. Buettner G.R.

In mycobacteria, autoxidation of flavins generates superoxide, which is subsequently converted into hydrogen peroxide by superoxide dismutase.

In the fast-growing soil bacterium Mycobacterium smegmatis, the dos system controls 11 operons and 49 genes in response to oxygen deprivation (13Berney M. Greening C. Conrad R. Jacobs Jr., W.R. Cook G.M. An obligately aerobic soil bacterium activates fermentative hydrogen production to survive reductive stress during hypoxia.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Fsq is among the mycobacterial proteins of the dos regulon and is highly up-regulated under hypoxia (13Berney M. Greening C. Conrad R. Jacobs Jr., W.R. Cook G.M. An obligately aerobic soil bacterium activates fermentative hydrogen production to survive reductive stress during hypoxia.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Fsq has recently been identified as belonging to a diverse and largely uncharacterized superfamily of flavin/deazaflavin oxidoreductases (FDORs) that are abundant in mycobacteria and other Actinobacteria (14Ahmed F.H.

This superfamily is characterized by a split β barrel structural fold that generally binds flavin/deazaflavin cofactors. The FDOR superfamily can be further split into two families: the FDOR-A family in which each has F420 as a cofactor and the more diverse FDOR-B family that can bind F420, FAD, or FMN as cofactors, or heme as a substrate. The FDOR-B family exhibits diverse functions, including pyridoxine 5′-phosphate oxidases (PnPOxs), biliverdin reductases, and heme oxygenases (14Ahmed F.H. Carr P.D. Lee B.M. Afriat-Jurnou L.

Understanding of physiological roles of the uncharacterized genes of the dos regulon remains an important goal as they may provide insight into the unique mechanisms of adaptation these bacteria have evolved to survive both the stress of entry into hypoxia and re-entry into aerobic growth conditions during their normal life cycle. In this communication, we determined the role of Fsq in adaptation to hypoxia through a combination of bioinformatic, genetic, biochemical, and physiological approaches. A previous bioinformatics analysis of the diverse superfamily of FDORs placed Fsq within a discrete FAD-binding subfamily alongside MSMEG_6368 and rv3129 from Mycobacterium tuberculosis (14Ahmed F.H. Carr P.D. Lee B.M. Afriat-Jurnou L. Mohamed A.E. Hong N.S. Flanagan J. Taylor M.C. Greening C. Jackson C.J. Sequence-structure-function classification of a catalytically diverse oxidoreductase superfamily in mycobacteria.J. Mol.

We compared the genetic organization, expression levels, and primary sequences of Fsq and MSMEG_6368 to gain insight into their possible cellular roles. Based on pairwise alignment, Fsq shares 64% amino acid identity with rv3129 and 54% identity with MSMEG_6368. The fsq and rv3129 genes are both part of the dosR regulon and share similar genomic contexts, with both being in the same region as dosR (Fig. 1a). Conversely, MSMEG_6368 is not part of the dosR regulon and does not share the same genomic context as fsq (13Berney M. Greening C. Conrad R. Jacobs Jr., W.R. Cook G.M. An obligately aerobic soil bacterium activates fermentative hydrogen production to survive reductive stress during hypoxia.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2014; 111 (25049411): 11479-1148410.1073/pnas.1407034111Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Quantitative RT-PCR confirmed that fsq, but not MSMEG_6368, is up-regulated by 4.7-fold under hypoxia (p = 0.003) (Fig. 1b). The tgs1 gene encoding the TAG synthase 1, a gene known to be controlled by DosR, was up-regulated 2.3-fold under hypoxia (Fig. 1b). A sequence similarity network (SSN) was used to examine the FAD-binding subfamily that includes Fsq and MSMEG_6368 in greater detail than in our previous study (14Ahmed F.H. Carr P.D. Lee B.M. Afriat-Jurnou L. Mohamed A.E. Hong N.S. Flanagan J. Taylor M.C. Greening C. Jackson C.J. Sequence-structure-function classification of a catalytically diverse oxidoreductase superfamily in mycobacteria.J. Mol. Biol. 2015; 427 (26434506): 3554-357110.1016/j.jmb.2015.09.021Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). We initially truncated the dataset such that sequences with less than 70% coverage and less than 30% identity to Fsq were excluded from analysis. This gave an initial network of 1124 nodes, which formed a large group without application of a logE filter (Fig. 1c). Several small groups (primarily consisting of sequences from orders other than Corynebacteriales and Micrococcales) separate out when only edge scores with logE <−36 were considered (Fig. 1d). The main cluster contained nodes including FSQ, MSMEG_6368, and rv3129. When edges were further filtered to logE <−53, a large cluster containing only sequences from Corynebacteriales becomes apparent (Fig. 1e). The mycobacterial sequences represented include slow-growing pathogenic species such as M. tuberculosis, Mycobacterium kansasii, and Mycobacterium canettii, as well as fast-growing species such as Mycobacterium wolinskyi, Mycobacterium phlei, and Mycobacterium fortuitum, suggesting that Fsq homologs are highly conserved throughout mycobacterial species. Finally, when edge scores with logE <−67 were considered, a cluster containing MSMEG_6368 separates from Fsq and rv3129. The high level of sequence conservation among this final group of homologs, across such a large number of mycobacterial species, suggests that Fsq and rv3129 are under strong selective pressure to maintain a physiological function (Fig. 1f), and therefore are proposed to be flavin-sequestering family proteins (FSFP). In contrast, MSMEG_6368 appears to be less conserved among mycobacteria. To determine the function of fsq, we constructed a markerless deletion mutant strain Δfsq (Fig. 2a) (Table S1). The Δfsq deletion mutant was confirmed by PCR and whole genome sequencing. Strain Δfsq and the isogenic WT parent strain were grown under aerobic conditions on a range of different carbon sources (fermentable and nonfermentable) and no differences in growth rate or final cell yield were observed between the strains (Fig. S1). However, when strains were grown in sealed serum vials that became hypoxic as cells grew (∼37 h), we observed a difference in the final optical density (600 nm) between the Δfsq mutant and the WT (Fig. 2b). To investigate this effect in more detail, we compared the cell viability of the Δfsq mutant to the isogenic WT and a ΔdosR mutant during prolonged incubation under hypoxia (Fig. 2c). The Δfsq mutant exhibited a survival defect compared with WT strain from day 10 post inoculation onwards, with the maximum difference observed being a 2-log difference at 22 days post inoculation (Fig. 2c). Consistent with previous findings (13Berney M. Greening C. Conrad R. Jacobs Jr., W.R. Cook G.M. An obligately aerobic soil bacterium activates fermentative hydrogen production to survive reductive stress during hypoxia.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2014; 111 (25049411): 11479-1148410.1073/pnas.1407034111Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), the ΔdosR mutant showed a 3-log decrease in viability after 10 days compared with WT. We were able to complement the Δfsq defect under hypoxia using complementing vector (pLH2, fsq+) induced with 20 ng/ml tetracycline (Fig. 2d). After 18 days, there was 0.24% survival for the WT with an empty vector, 0.22% survival for complemented Δfsq, and 0.02% survival for Δfsq mutant with an empty vector (Fig. 2d). The loss of viability observed for Δfsq mutant cells was initially hypothesized to be caused by Fsq playing a role in the complete activation of DosR given the two genes are in close proximity (Fig. 1a). To address this hypothesis, we determined the effect of the Δfsq mutation on the expression of a dos-regulated gene (hyd3-lacZ) in M. smegmatis (16Berney M. Greening C. Hards K. Collins D. Cook G.M. Three different [NiFe] hydrogenases confer metabolic flexibility in the obligate aerobe Mycobacterium smegmatis.Environ. Microbiol. 2014; 16 (24536093): 318-33010.1111/1462-2920.12320Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). When the expression of hyd3-lacZ was measured in the WT background, hyd3-lacZ was up-regulated in response to hypoxia (Fig. 2e). No up-regulation of hyd3-lacZ was observed in the ΔdosR mutant, but WT levels of hyd3-lacZ expression were observed in the Δfsq mutant, confirming that fsq did not play a role in DosR activation. MSMEG_6368 shares 54% identity with Fsq but is not part of the dosR regulon, suggesting a distinct functional role. To investigate the functional role of MSMEG_6368 and rule out MSMEG_6368 compensating for the loss of fsq in the Δfsq mutant, we created a markerless deletion mutant of MSMEG_6368 (strain Δ6368) (Table S1). We then grew the Δ6368 mutant and the isogenic WT strain on a range of carbon sources (fermentable and nonfermentable) under aerobic conditions and found that there was no detectable difference in the growth rate or final cell yield (Fig. S2, a and b). No phenotypic differences in growth or cell viability between the Δ6368 mutant and the isogenic WT strain were observed under hypoxia (Fig. S2, c and d). We then used qPCR to monitor the expression of MSMEG_6368 in the WT and Δfsq mutant (Fig. S2e). During hypoxia, the expression of MSMEG_6368 was not different in the Δfsq mutant compared with the WT. These data suggest that MSMEG_6368 does not provide compensation for fsq in the Δfsq mutant during hypoxia. To determine the biochemical function of Fsq, we expressed Fsq in Escherichia coli and purified the protein to homogeneity. Fsq had previously been demonstrated to preferentially bind to FAD over other structurally similar cofactors FMN and F420, with a Kd value of 3.6 μm (14Ahmed F.H. Carr P.D. Lee B.M. Afriat-Jurnou L.

We set about testing whether Fsq could function as a flavin-sequestering protein by solving and analyzing its X-ray crystal structure and testing its electrochemical properties. Fsq heterologously produced in E. coli co-purified with a cofactor that has a UV-visible absorbance spectrum with peaks at 374 nm and 456 nm, which is consistent with FAD (Fig. 3a). To confirm the identity of this cofactor, we crystallized the purified protein (Fig. 3b), obtaining 2.7 Å resolution diffraction (Table 1). The crystal contained 20 molecules in the asymmetric unit, arranged as homodimers (Fig. 3c). Omit electron density (mFo − DFc) consistent with FAD was observed at the dimer interfaces/cofactor-binding sites for 17 of these chains (Fig. 4, a and b). The remaining three chains had no FAD bound at this site, although they were part of dimers in which the other monomer was bound to FAD. There was no electron density to support covalent attachment of FAD to the protein, which is consistent with previous work showing that bound FAD can be readily removed from Fsq through partial unfolding-refolding (14Ahmed F.H.

Most notably, a loop region in the apo-protein forms α-helix-6 in the holo-protein, which interacts with the phosphate groups of FAD (Fig. 4, c and d). Although the apo-protein contains both α-helix-9 and α-helix-10, the position of α-helix-9 is shifted in the holo-protein, causing α-helix-10 to unravel. This lengthens loop-a between α-helix-9 and β-sheet-7, allowing it to accommodate the isoalloxazine group of FAD (Fig. 4, b and d). This substantial change upon cofactor binding is unusual for proteins of the FDOR family, as structurally characterized FMN- and F420-binding proteins show only slight topological differences between their apo- and holo- forms (Fig. S3) (14Ahmed F.H.

This structural rearrangement results in essentially complete enclosure of the cofactor within the interior of the protein. From the pairwise alignment of Fsq and rv3129 we found that the majority of the key residues were maintained except for a proline 45 and leucine 30, which were deleted in rv3129. Flavin/deazaflavin-binding proteins can typically carry out three broad roles: enzymes that catalyze chemical reactions (19Walsh C.

In FDORs with known enzymatic activity, catalysis occurs on the Re-face of the isoalloxazine rings of their flavin cofactors, which is solvent accessible to allow substrate binding (15Ahmed F.H. Mohamed A.E. Carr P.D. Lee B.M. Condic-Jurkic K. O'Mara M.L. Jackson C.J. Rv2074 is a novel F420 H2-dependent biliverdin reductase in Mycobacterium tuberculosis.Protein Sci. 2016; 25 (27364382): 1692-170910.1002/pro.2975Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 17Mashalidis E.H.

In contrast, for Fsq, we found that the isoalloxazine ring of FAD is fully enclosed by the protein, making the Re-face completely inaccessible as a substrate-binding site (Fig. 4e). This is achieved by an offset parallel stacking interaction between the xylene and pyrazine rings of the isoalloxazine and Phe-136 of the secondary chain in the dimer, and loop-a (which undergoes a conformational change upon FAD binding) covers the pyrimidine ring with hydrophobic interactions from Trp-115 from the primary chain (Fig. 4f). The lack of any substrate-binding site will prevent binding or catalysis of small molecule substrates, making it unlikely that Fsq is an enzyme. Protein film voltammetry was employed to determine the effect of Fsq on the electrochemical properties of the cofactor, which could also provide insight into its physiological role. Both Fsq and FAD displayed a single reversible redox peak at all pH values that we tested, with no evidence of one-electron reductions (Fig. 5a), as is seen in some flavin-dependent enzymes such as fumarate reductase (24Jeuken L.J.C. Jones A.K. Chapman S.K. Cecchini G. Armstrong F.A. Electron-transfer mechanisms through biological redox chains in multicenter enzymes.J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2002; 124 (12010043): 5702-571310.1021/ja012638wCrossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). At pH 7.3, the redox potential of FAD was found to be −260 ± 3 mV (versus normal hydrogen electrode), whereas that of Fsq:FAD was −246 ± 9 mV (Fig. 5a). Thus, the redox potential of FAD is not substantially changed by Fsq. This is in contrast to many enzymes and electron-transfer proteins that can alter the redox potentials more than 100 mV in either direction to carry out catalysis (25Segal H.M. Spatzal T. Hill M.G. Udit A.K. Rees D.C. Electrochemical and structural characterization of Azotobacter vinelandii flavodoxin II.Protein Sci. 2017; 26 (28710816): 1984-199310.1002/pro.3236Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 26Heuts D.P.

There was relatively little difference in the effect of pH on the redox potential of free and complexed FAD (−45 mV/pH unit and −39 mV/pH unit, respectively) with no redox-linked pKa observed in the range of 3.6–7.3. This contrasts again with electron-transfer proteins, such as flavodoxins, that have a redox-linked pKa between pH 4.6 and 6.8 (25Segal H.M. Spatzal T. Hill M.G. Udit A.K. Rees D.C. Electrochemical and structural characterization of Azotobacter vinelandii flavodoxin II.Protein Sci. 2017; 26 (28710816): 1984-199310.1002/pro.3236Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 27Heering H.A.

The values for free FAD are consistent with previous studies of free FAD on carbon nanotube–modified electrodes (28Goran J.M. Stevenson K.J. Electrochemical behavior of flavin adenine dinucleotide adsorbed onto carbon nanotube and nitrogen-doped carbon nanotube electrodes.Langmuir. 2013; 29 (24156654): 13605-1361310.1021/la403020yCrossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). In summary, FAD appears to be relatively stable and unreactive when bound to Fsq, making it unlikely that this protein:flavin complex is involved in catalysis or electron-transfer reactions, leaving the possibility that it is involved in FAD sequestration. Based on the structural and biochemical data that suggest Fsq is unlikely to have either a catalytic or electron-transfer role in mycobacterial physiology, and the reduced fitness of the Δfsq strain in hypoxic conditions, we hypothesized one benefit of FAD sequestration by Fsq could be the prevention of FAD autoxidation to avert superoxide formation and cellular damage. One of the key challenges that mycobacterial species must overcome to survive hypoxia is mitigating oxidative damage upon entry to and re-aeration from hypoxia. To test this hypothesis, we challenged the Δfsq mutant and isogenic WT grown in either hypoxia (inducing conditions) or aerobic conditions (noninducing) with hydrogen peroxide (Fig. 6). Under aerobic conditions, there was no significant difference in cell viability between the WT and Δfsq mutant in response to hydrogen peroxide challenge (Fig. 6a). However, under hypoxic conditions, the Δfsq mutant was significantly (p = 0.0082) more sensitive to hydrogen peroxide challenge compared with the WT (Fig. 6b). When fsq was overexpressed in cells using the tetracycline-inducible vector pLH2 (fsq+), we could protect cells from killing by hydrogen peroxide stress compared with the empty vector control (VC) (Fig. 6c). These results establish the molecular process by which Fsq confers a fitness advantage to M. smegmatis during recovery from hypoxia. However, they do not explain the fitness advantage of Fsq to M. smegmatis during long-term hypoxic growth. Thus, although at least one physiological function of Fsq is now defined, other specific functions related to hypoxic survival could also exist. Having confirmed that Fsq protects M. smegmatis against oxidative damage when emerging from hypoxic conditions by sequestering free FAD, we examined whether other examples of mycobacterial cofactor-sequestering proteins have been reported in the literature. M. tuberculosis and M. smegmatis have both been shown to harbor a nonfunctional nitroreductase designated Acg that has been shown to function as a flavin mononucleotide (FMN) storage protein or used to sequester FMN from other biochemical pathways (29Chauviac F.X. Bommer M. Yan J. Parkin G. Daviter T. Lowden P. Raven E.L. Thalassinos K. Keep N.H. Crystal structure of reduced MsAcg, a putative nitroreductase from Mycobacterium smegmatis and a close homologue of Mycobacterium tuberculosis Acg.J. Biol.

However, as we have observed with Fsq, the Acg structure encloses (“caps”) FMN in a way to sterically prevent reactivity with NAD(P)H. Thus, like Fsq, Acg also appears to have evolved from a superfamily in which most proteins are enzymes and, under selective pressure, have lost the ability to bind substrate to develop a cofactor-sequestration function. Notably, the acg gene is also regulated as part of the dosR regulon (29Chauviac F.X. Bommer M. Yan J. Parkin G. Daviter T. Lowden P. Raven E.L. Thalassinos K. Keep N.H. Crystal structure of reduced MsAcg, a putative nitroreductase from Mycobacterium smegmatis and a close homologue of Mycobacterium tuberculosis Acg.J. Biol.

The observation that mycobacteria has evolved two different proteins that each sequester flavin cofactors to prevent deleterious interactions, both of which are under control of the DosR regulon, highlights the biochemical challenges imposed by the descent into, and emergence from, hypoxia. These examples provide us with deeper understanding of the mechanisms that mycobacteria have evolved to adapt to the pressures associated with hypoxic conditions. Mycobacteria utilize a diverse array of flavins in a wide variety of essential electron-transfer reactions, including FAD, FMN, and F420 (30Macheroux P. Kappes B. Ealick S.E. Flavogenomics—a genomic and structural view of flavin-dependent proteins.FEBS J. 2011; 278 (21635694): 2625-263410.1111/j.1742-4658.2011.08202.xCrossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Previously, it has been shown that mycobacteria possess proteins such as Acg to sequester FMN in hypoxic conditions. In this study we infer, using a combination of biochemical, structural, and electrochemical data, that Fsq from M. smegmatis functions to sequester FAD under hypoxia. The expression of fsq is controlled by DosR and mutants defective in fsq are hypersensitive to oxidative stress when recovering from hypoxia. These data suggest that the ability of Fsq to sequester FAD protects it from autoxidation and the production of ROS under hypoxia."

Peak workload and peak heart rate (HR) were assessed by a maximal cycle exercise test. Cardiac function including stroke volume (SV) and vascular stiffness were evaluated by ultrasound at rest. Handgrip strength, body composition, haemoglobin level and self-reported physical activity were assessed.Peak workload (221±60, 185±59, 150±54 W for controls, CKD 2-3 and CKD 4-5 respectively), peak HR (177±11, 161±24, 144±31 beats/min) and haemoglobin level (14.2±1.2, 13.5±1.4, 12.2±1.3 g/dL) were all three significantly lower in CKD 2-3 than in controls, (p = 0.001, 0.001 and 0.03 respectively) and were even lower in stages 4-5 CKD than in CKD 2-3 (p = 0.01, 0.001 and <0.001 respectively). Resting SV and lean body mass did not differ between groups and handgrip strength was significantly lower only in CKD 4-5 compared to controls (p = 0.02). Peak workload was strongly associated with the systemic oxygen delivery factors: SV, peak HR and haemoglobin level. These three factors along with age, sex and height2 explained 82% of variation in peak workload. Peak HR contributed most to the variation; the peripheral variables handgrip strength and vascular stiffness did not improve the explanatory value in regression analysis.In this cross-sectional study of CKD patients not on dialysis, aerobic ExCap decreased gradually with disease severity. ExCap was associated mainly with systemic oxygen delivery factors, in particular peak HR. Neither muscle function and mass, nor vascular stiffness were independent determinants of aerobic ExCap in this group of CKD patients."

However, the direct binding partner and underlying interactions mediating the Tat-SF1–U2 snRNP association remain unknown. Here, we identified SF3b1 as a Tat-SF1–interacting subunit of the U2 snRNP. Our 1.1 A resolution crystal structure revealed that Tat-SF1 contains a U2AF homology motif (UHM) protein–protein interaction module. We demonstrated that Tat-SF1 preferentially and directly binds the SF3b1 subunit compared with other U2AF ligand motif (ULM)-containing splicing factors, and further established that SF3b1 association depends on the integrity of the Tat-SF1 UHM. We next compared the Tat-SF1–binding affinities for each of the five known SF3b1 ULMs and then determined the structures of representative high- and low-affinity SF3b1 ULM complexes with the Tat-SF1 UHM at 1.9 A and 2.1 A resolutions, respectively. These structures revealed a canonical UHM–ULM interface, comprising a Tat-SF1 binding pocket for a ULM tryptophan (SF3b1 Trp338) and electrostatic interactions with a basic ULM tail. Importantly, we found that SF3b1 regulates Tat-SF1 levels and that these two factors influence expression of overlapping representative transcripts, consistent with a functional partnership of Tat-SF1 and SF3b1. Altogether, these results define a new molecular interface of the Tat-SF1–U2 snRNP complex for gene regulation."
https://openalex.org/W2904760141,"The p63 transcription factor, a p53 family protein, regulates genes involved in various cellular processes, including cell growth and differentiation. We previously showed that RNA-binding motif protein (Rbm38) is a p63 target and, in turn, regulates p63α mRNA stability by binding to the AU/U-rich element in its 3′UTR. Interestingly, Rbm38 can be phosphorylated at serine 195, altering its ability to regulate mRNA translation. However, whether the Ser-195 phosphorylation affects Rbm38’s ability to destabilize p63 mRNA remains unclear.

We also found that upon activation of glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK3β), phosphorylation of Rbm38 at Ser-195 is increased, enhancing p63α expression in an Rbm38-dependent manner. To confirm this, we generated mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEFs) in which Ser-193 in mouse Rbm38 (equivalent to Ser-195 in human Rbm38) was substituted with aspartic acid (Rbm38S193D/S193D) or alanine (Rbm38S193A/S193A). We observed that the p63 transcript level was increased in Rbm38S193D/S193D MEFs, but decreased in Rbm38S193A/S193A MEFs. Mechanistically, we found that WT Rbm38, but not Rbm38-S195D, is required for p63 mRNA degradation mediated by microRNA 203 (miR203). Furthermore, we noted that Argonaute 2 (Ago2), a key regulator in microRNA-mediated mRNA decay, associates with WT Rbm38, and this association was reduced by Ser-195 phosphorylation.

Because of the usage of two distinct promoters, p63 is expressed as two major isoforms, called TAp63 and ΔNp63, both of which have multiple variants through alternative splicing at the C terminus (2Yang A. Kaghad M. Wang Y. Gillett E. Fleming M.D. Dötsch V. Andrews N.C. Caput D.

Like p53, p63 functions as a transcription factor and induces many targets involved in various cellular processes, including cell proliferation, differentiation, epithelial development, and cellular senescence (4Koster M.I.

Interestingly, although p63 shares many functional properties with p53, p63 is not a classic tumor suppressor as p63 is rarely mutated in human cancers. Indeed, p63 exhibits unique functions in the regulation of differentiation and development (6Yang A. Schweitzer R. Sun D. Kaghad M. Walker N. Bronson R.T. Tabin C. Sharpe A. Caput D. Crum C. McKeon F. p63 is essential for regenerative proliferation in limb, craniofacial and epithelial development.Nature. 1999; 398 (10227294): 714-71810.1038/19539Crossref PubMed Scopus (1908) Google Scholar). Consistently, p63-deficient mice exhibit severe developmental defects in limb, skin, hair, teeth, and mammary and salivary glands (5Mills A.A. Zheng B. Wang X.J. Vogel H. Roop D.R.

Thus, exploring how p63 is regulated is critical for understanding the biological function of p63. The RNA-binding protein Rbm38, also called RNPC1, is a target of the p53 family, including p63, as well as E2F1 (7Feldstein O. Ben-Hamo R. Bashari D. Efroni S. Ginsberg D. RBM38 is a direct transcriptional target of E2F1 that limits E2F1-induced proliferation.Mol.

Rbm38 is found to regulate expression of genes necessary for several cellular processes, including cell growth and differentiation. For example, Rbm38 is found to regulate Mdm2, p21, p73, and Pten mRNA stability through binding to the AU/U-rich elements in their 3′UTRs (8Shu L. Yan W. Chen X.

We also found that Rbm38 decreases p63α/β mRNA stability by binding to AU/U-rich elements in their 3′UTR (12Jiang Y. Xu E. Zhang J. Chen M. Flores E. Chen X. The Rbm38-p63 feedback loop is critical for tumor suppression and longevity.Oncogene. 2018; 37 (29520104): 2863-287210.1038/s41388-018-0176-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 13Zhang J.

By contrast, Rbm38 enhances p63γ mRNA stability by binding to a GU-rich element in p63γ 3′UTR, which has a sequence different from that in p63α/β 3′UTR (14Yan W. Zhang Y. Chen X. TAp63γ and ΔNp63γ are regulated by RBM38 via mRNA stability and have an opposing function in growth suppression.Oncotarget. 2017; 8 (29108232): 78327-7833910.18632/oncotarget.18463Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). In addition, we found that Rbm38 interacts with p53 mRNA and represses p53 translation (15Zhang J. Cho S.J. Shu L. Yan W. Guerrero T. Kent M. Skorupski K. Chen H. Chen X. Translational repression of p53 by RNPC1, a p53 target overexpressed in lymphomas.Genes Dev. 2011; 25 (21764855): 1528-154310.1101/gad.2069311Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Moreover, Rbm38 is capable of regulating gene expression by modulating miRNA 2The abbreviations used are: miRNAmicroRNAMEFmouse embryo fibroblastDRB5,6-dichlorobenzimidazole-β-d-ribofuranosideGSK3βglycogen synthase kinase-3βPI3Kphosphatidylinositol 3-kinaseAktprotein kinase BsgRNAsingle-guide RNAgRNAguide RNAIPimmunoprecipitationntnucleotide. activity (16Léveillé N.

Previous studies showed that GSK3β can phosphorylate β-catenin and promotes its degradation (18Daugherty R.L. Gottardi C.J. Phospho-regulation of β-catenin adhesion and signaling functions.Physiology. 2007; 22 (17928543): 303-30910.1152/physiol.00020.2007Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar, 19Liu C. Li Y.

Our group also showed that Rbm38 can be phosphorylated by GSK3β at Ser-195, and Ser-195 phosphorylation converts Rbm38 from a repressor to an activator of p53 mRNA translation via altered interaction with eIF4E (20Zhang M. Zhang J. Chen X. Cho S.J. Chen X. Glycogen synthase kinase 3 promotes p53 mRNA translation via phosphorylation of RNPC1.Genes Dev. 2013; 27 (24142875): 2246-225810.1101/gad.221739.113Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The unique function of Ser-195 phosphorylation in Rbm38 let us postulate whether Ser-195 phosphorylation alters the ability of Rbm38 to regulate p63 mRNA stability. Indeed, we found that Ser-195 phosphorylation abrogates the ability of Rbm38 to decrease p63α expression. Furthermore, we showed that WT Rbm38, but not phosphomimetic Rbm38-S195D, physically associates with Ago2, which is required for miR203 to target p63α mRNA for degradation. Together, we uncovered a novel mechanism by which Ser-195 phosphorylation in Rbm38 increases p63 expression by attenuating the association of Rbm38 with the Ago2–miR203 complex. Previously, we found that Rbm38 negatively regulates p63α mRNA stability through binding to the AU/U-rich elements in p63 3′UTR (12Jiang Y. Xu E. Zhang J. Chen M. Flores E. Chen X. The Rbm38-p63 feedback loop is critical for tumor suppression and longevity.Oncogene. 2018; 37 (29520104): 2863-287210.1038/s41388-018-0176-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 13Zhang J.

We also found that phosphorylation of Ser-195 in Rbm38 alters the ability of Rbm38 from a repressor to an activator of p53 mRNA translation (20Zhang M. Zhang J. Chen X. Cho S.J. Chen X. Glycogen synthase kinase 3 promotes p53 mRNA translation via phosphorylation of RNPC1.Genes Dev. 2013; 27 (24142875): 2246-225810.1101/gad.221739.113Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Thus, we wanted to determine whether Ser-195 phosphorylation alters the ability of Rbm38 to regulate p63 mRNA stability. To test this, p63 expression was examined in multiple cell lines that inducibly express HA-tagged WT Rbm38, nonphosphorylatable Rbm38-S195A, or phosphomimetic Rbm38-S195D. We would like to mention that Rbm38 protein is expressed as two bands in the SDS-polyacrylamide gel: the upper (slow-migrating) band representing Ser-195–phosphorylated Rbm38; the lower (fast-migrating) band representing unphosphorylated Rbm38 (8Shu L.

Consistently, we found that upon induction, Rbm38 protein was expressed as two bands in cell lines that inducibly express HA-tagged WT Rbm38 (Fig. 1, A and C, lanes 1 and 2), whereas Rbm38-S195A protein was expressed as the fast-migrating nonphosphorylatable band (Fig. 1, A and C, lanes 3 and 4). In contrast, Rbm38-S195D protein was expressed as the slow-migrating Ser-195 phosphomimetic Rbm38 (Fig. 1, A and C, lanes 5 and 6). Interestingly, we found that both WT Rbm38 and S195A were capable of suppressing ΔNp63α expression in MCF7 and HaCaT cells (Fig. 1, A and C, lanes 1–4). In contrast, Rbm38-S195D did not suppress ΔNp63α expression in MCF7 cells (Fig. 1A, lanes 5 and 6) and even slightly increased ΔNp63α expression in HaCaT cells (Fig. 1C, lanes 5 and 6). Similar results were observed in ME180 and MIA-PaCa2 cells transiently transfected with a control vector or a vector expressing HA-tagged WT Rbm38, S195A, or S195D (Fig. S1). Consistent with this, we found that the level of p63α transcript was decreased by WT Rbm38 and S195A in MCF7 (Fig. 1B) and HaCaT cells (Fig. 1D). In contrast, upon expression of Rbm38-S195D, the level of p63α transcript was increased highly in HaCaT cells (Fig. 1D) and slightly in MCF7 cells (Fig. 1B). To rule out potential nonphysiological artifacts of ectopic expression above, we generated Rbm38-KI mice in which Ser-193 (equivalent to Ser-195 in human Rbm38) is substituted with alanine (S193A) or aspartic acid (S193D). Next, these mice were used to generate a set of Rbm38S193A/S193A (A/A) and Rbm38S193D/S193D (D/D) MEFs along with WT and Rbm38−/− MEFs as a control. As shown in Fig. 1E, Rbm38 was detected in WT but not Rbm38−/− MEFs. We also showed that S193A and S193D proteins were expressed as two polypeptides with similar migration patterns as WT Rbm38 (Fig. 1E), suggesting that the slower migrating band of S193A and S193D proteins may be subjected to phosphorylation at other serine/threonine residues. Nevertheless, we found that loss of Rbm38 led to increased expression of p63 mRNA in Rbm38−/− MEFs as compared with that in WT MEFs (Fig. 1F, lanes 1 and 2), which is consistent with a previous report (12Jiang Y. Xu E. Zhang J. Chen M. Flores E. Chen X. The Rbm38-p63 feedback loop is critical for tumor suppression and longevity.Oncogene. 2018; 37 (29520104): 2863-287210.1038/s41388-018-0176-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Interestingly, we found that the level of p63 transcript was deceased in A/A MEFs but increased in D/D MEFs (Fig. 1F). These data indicate that the effect of ectopic Rbm38-S195A or Rbm38-S195D on p63 expression in MCF7 and HaCaT cells is recapitulated by endogenous knockin Rbm38-S193A and Rbm38-S193D in MEFs. To determine whether the increased expression of p63 transcript by Rbm38-S193D is due to increased p63 mRNA stability, the half-life of p63 mRNA was determined in WT and D/D MEFs treated with 5,6-dichlorobenzimidazole-β-d-ribofuranoside (DRB; 100 μm) for various times. We found that the half-life of p63 mRNA was increased from 4.44 h in WT MEFs to 7.06 h in D/D MEFs (Fig. 1G). These data suggest that phosphomimetic S195D abrogates the ability of Rbm38 to decrease p63 mRNA stability. Glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK3β), a Ser/Thr kinase, is a master regulator for many cellular activities, including gene expression, cell cycle, and apoptosis (21Kockeritz L. Doble B. Patel S. Woodgett J.R. Glycogen synthase kinase-3–an overview of an over-achieving protein kinase.Curr. Drug Targets. 2006; 7 (17100578): 1377-138810.2174/1389450110607011377Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). It is well known that Akt kinase phosphorylates GSK3β at Ser-9 and then inhibits GSK3β activity (22Cross D.A. Alessi D.R. Cohen P. Andjelkovich M. Hemmings B.A. Inhibition of glycogen synthase kinase-3 by insulin mediated by protein kinase B.Nature. 1995; 378 (8524413): 785-78910.1038/378785a0Crossref PubMed Scopus (4364) Google Scholar). Previously, we found that upon inhibition of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)–protein kinase B (Akt) pathway, GSK3β is activated and then phosphorylates Rbm38 at Ser-195, leading to increased p53 expression (20Zhang M. Zhang J. Chen X. Cho S.J. Chen X. Glycogen synthase kinase 3 promotes p53 mRNA translation via phosphorylation of RNPC1.Genes Dev. 2013; 27 (24142875): 2246-225810.1101/gad.221739.113Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Because Ser-195 phosphorylation alters the ability of Rbm38 to regulate p53 expression, we sought to determine whether p63 expression is regulated by the Akt–GSK3 pathway via Rbm38. To test this, MCF7 and ME180 cells were treated with MK2206, a potent inhibitor of Akt kinase (23Hirai H. Sootome H. Nakatsuru Y. Miyama K. Taguchi S. Tsujioka K. Ueno Y. Hatch H. Majumder P.K. Pan B.S. Kotani H. MK-2206, an allosteric Akt inhibitor, enhances antitumor efficacy by standard chemotherapeutic agents or molecular targeted drugs in vitro and in vivo.Mol. Cancer Ther. 2010; 9 (20571069): 1956-196710.1158/1535-7163.MCT-09-1012Crossref PubMed Scopus (697) Google Scholar). We showed that upon treatment with MK2206, the level of Ser-9–phosphorylated GSK3β, but not total GSK3β, was decreased in MCF7 and ME180 cells (Fig. 2, A and C, p-GSK3β and GSK3β panels), concomitantly with an increase in phosphorylated Rbm38 as detected by a specific antibody against Ser-195–phosphorylated Rbm38 (Fig. 2, A and C, p-Rbm38 panels). Importantly, we found that the levels of p63 protein and transcript were highly increased in MCF7 cells (Fig. 2, A and B) and ME180 cells (Fig. 2, C and D) by MK2206 in a dose-dependent manner. To confirm that Rbm38 is necessary for enhanced p63 expression by the Akt inhibitor, Rbm38-knockdown MCF7 cells were treated with or without MK2206. We showed that the levels of p63 protein and transcript were increased in MCF7 cells upon treatment with MK2206 in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 2, E and F, compare lanes 1 with 2 and 3). However, upon knockdown of Rbm38, MK2206 had little if any effect on the levels of p63 protein and transcript (Fig. 2, E and F, compare lanes 4 with 5 and 6). Additionally, we would like to note that the levels of p63 protein and transcript were increased in MCF7 cells upon knockdown of Rbm38 (Fig. 2, E and F, ΔNp63 panels), consistent with our previous study (13Zhang J. Jun Cho S. Chen X. RNPC1, an RNA-binding protein and a target of the p53 family, regulates p63 expression through mRNA stability.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2010; 107 (20457941): 9614-961910.1073/pnas.0912594107Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). These results suggest that p63 expression is increased by Ser-195 phosphorylation of Rbm38 via the Akt–GSK3 pathway. Previously, we reported that endogenous Rbm38 destabilizes p63 mRNA through binding to an AU/U-rich element in p63 3′UTR (13Zhang J. Jun Cho S. Chen X. RNPC1, an RNA-binding protein and a target of the p53 family, regulates p63 expression through mRNA stability.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2010; 107 (20457941): 9614-961910.1073/pnas.0912594107Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). To determine whether p63 3′UTR is recognized by S193D to regulate p63 expression, RNA ChIP assay was performed with anti-Rbm38 antibody using extracts from WT, A/A (Rbm38S193A/S193A) and D/D (Rbm38S193D/S193D) MEFs, followed by RT-PCR. IgG was used as an isotype control, and actin mRNA was measured as a negative control. We found that p63 mRNA was present in Rbm38/S193A/S193D, but not in control IgG, immunocomplexes (Fig. 3, A and B, p63 panels, compare lanes 3 and 4 with 5 and 6, respectively). These data suggest that like Rbm38, S193A and S193D are capable of binding to p63 mRNA. As a control, we found that actin mRNA was not detected in Rbm38, S193A, and S193D immunocomplexes (Fig. 3, A and B, Actin panel, compare lanes 3 and 4 with 5 and 6, respectively). Next, to determine the Rbm38-binding site in p63α 3′UTR, multiple reporters were generated (Fig. 3C). First, a reporter carrying the GFP-coding region plus p63 5′UTR (Fig. 3, D and E) was transfected into MCF7 cells together with an empty vector or a vector expressing HA-tagged Rbm38 or Rbm38-S195D. We found that both Rbm38 and S195D had no effect on the level of GFP from a reporter that carries the GFP-coding region plus p63 5′UTR (Fig. 3, D and E, GFP panel, compare lanes 1 and 2). Next, a reporter that carries the p63-coding region alone or together with p63 3′UTR was used. We found that neither Rbm38 nor S195D had an effect on the p63 expression from a p63 reporter that carries only the p63-coding region (Fig. 3F). Interestingly, we found that the level of p63 protein was repressed by Rbm38, but increased by S195D, from the reporter that carries the p63-coding region plus p63 3′UTR (Fig. 3G, compare lane 1 with 2 and 3, respectively). To verify this, we generated a reporter, which carries HA-tagged mutant p53-R175H along with p63 3′UTR (Fig. 3C). Consistently, we found that the level of p53-R175H was decreased by Rbm38 but increased by S195D (Fig. 3H). Rbm38 is known to bind to p63 mRNA via a poly(U)-rich element (13Zhang J. Jun Cho S. Chen X. RNPC1, an RNA-binding protein and a target of the p53 family, regulates p63 expression through mRNA stability.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Thus, we generated another reporter, which carries HA-tagged mutant p53-R175H along with poly(U)-deleted p63 3′UTR (lacking nt 4071–4098) (Fig. 3C). We found that upon deletion of the poly(U)-rich element both Rbm38 and S195D were unable to regulate p53-R175H expression (Fig. 3I). These data suggest that the poly(U)-rich element in p63 3′UTR is necessary for Rbm38 and S195D to regulate p63 mRNA stability. miRNAs are known to regulate RNA stability by binding to the 3′UTR of a target mRNA (24Bagga S.

Interestingly, the binding site for miR203 in p63 3′UTR is adjacent to the one for Rbm38. Because Rbm38 is known to modulate the access of miRNAs to its targets (16Léveillé N. Elkon R. Davalos V.

Commun. 2011; 2 (22027593): 51310.1038/ncomms1519Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), we wanted to determine whether miR203 is involved in the differential regulation of p63 mRNA stability by Rbm38 and S195D. To test this, multiple cell lines were used and transfected with a control miRNA or miR203 mimic. miR203 mimic is a small, chemically modified dsRNA that mimics endogenous miR203. We showed that the levels of p63 protein and transcript were decreased by miR203 in MCF7 cells (Fig. 4A, top and bottom panels) and ME180 and Mia-PaCa2 cells (Fig. S2, A and B), consistent with the previous study (28Yi R.

Next, to determine whether Rbm38 is involved in miR203-mediated p63 expression, we generated the Rbm38-KO MCF7 cell line by using CRISPR/Cas9 technology. We showed that in the absence of Rbm38, miR203 had very little effect on p63 expression (Fig. 4B, p63 panel, compare lanes 1 and 2). Upon ectopic expression of HA-tagged Rbm38, p63 expression was markedly inhibited by Rbm38 (Fig. 4B, p63 panel, compare lanes 1 and 3), which was further inhibited by co-expression of miR203 (Fig. 4B, p63 panel, compared lane 3 with 4; also compare lanes 1 and 4). These data suggest that the ability of miR203 to suppress p63 expression is Rbm38-dependent. In contrast, p63 expression was increase"

https://openalex.org/W2906129150,"Small heat shock proteins (sHSPs) delay protein aggregation in an ATP-independent manner by interacting with client proteins that are in states susceptible to aggregation, including destabilized states related to cellular stress. Up-regulation of sHSPs under stress conditions supports their critical role in cellular viability. Widespread distribution of sHSPs in most organisms implies conservation of function, but it remains unclear whether sHSPs implement common or distinct mechanisms to delay protein aggregation. Comparisons among various studies are confounded by the use of different model client proteins, different assays for both aggregation and sHSP/client interactions, and variable experimental conditions used to mimic cellular stress. To further define sHSP/client interactions and their relevance to sHSP chaperone function, we implemented multiple strategies to characterize sHSP interactions with α-lactalbumin, a model client whose aggregation pathway is well defined. We compared the chaperone activity of human αB-crystallin (HSPB5) with HSPB5 variants that mimic states that arise under conditions of cellular stress or disease. The results show that these closely related sHSPs vary not only in their activity under identical conditions but also in their interactions with clients. Importantly, under nonstress conditions, WT HSPB5 delays client aggregation solely through transient interactions early in the aggregation pathway, whereas HSPB5 mutants that mimic stress-activated conditions can also intervene at later stages of the aggregation pathway to further delay client protein aggregation."
https://openalex.org/W2904565944,"The specific role of polyamines in the testis physiology is not fully understood. Antizymes (OAZs) and antizyme inhibitors (AZINs) are modulators of ornithine decarboxylase (ODC), a key enzyme in polyamine biosynthesis and polyamine uptake. Although the three known OAZs are expressed in the testis, only OAZ3 is testis specific and has been proven to have an essential role in male fertility. Regarding the two existing AZINs, AZIN2 is the most abundantly expressed member in this gonad. Whereas previous studies suggested that AZIN2 might participate in mouse spermatogenesis, immunohistological analysis of human testicular sections revealed that AZIN2 is also detected in the steroidogenic Leydig cells but not in the germinal epithelium. In the present study, we found a close ontogenic similarity in the mRNA levels of OAZs and AZINs between mice and rats, but an opposite expression pattern of ODC activity. Further analysis of AZIN2 and OAZ3 in the testis of mice with different alterations in spermatogenesis and fertility, induced either genetically or pharmacologically, corroborated that both AZIN2 and OAZ3 are mainly expressed in the haploid germinal cells. Finally, by using transgenic mice with a truncated Azin2 gene fused to the bacterial lacZ gene, we studied the expression of Azin2 in testes, epididymides and spermatozoa. AZIN2 was detected in spermatids and spermatozoa, as well as in Leydig cells, and in epithelial epidydimal cells. Azin2 knock-out male mice were fertile; however, they showed marked decreases in testicular putrescine and plasma and testicular testosterone levels, and a dramatic reduction in the sperm motility. These results suggest an important role for AZIN2 in testicular cells by modulating polyamine concentrations, testosterone synthesis and sperm function. Overall, our data corroborate the relevance of polyamine regulation in testis functions, where both AZIN2 and OAZ3 play fundamental roles."

Methods A population-based survey was conducted simultaneously in the cities of Kumba and Buea, located in the Southwest region of Cameroon. Data were collected from September to October 2016 by trained interviewers who administered questionnaires to eligible and consenting unmarried adults aged 21–35 years. Data were weighted and logistic regression analyses performed to identify significant predictors. The level of statistical significance was set at p< = 0.05. Results A total of 1,406 respondents (767 in Kumba and 639 in Buea) participated in the study. In the pooled sample, the median age of respondents was 26 years (IQR = 23–29) and over half (54.8%) were males. Over 90% of respondents in both cities indicated their willingness to accept pre-marital HIV testing. Respondents who had previously tested for HIV in Kumba (AOR = 7.87; 95%CI, 4.02–15.44) were significantly more likely to accept premarital HIV testing than those who had never tested for HIV. In Kumba, older age (AOR = 0.42; 95%CI, 0.18–0.96) and those unemployed (AOR = 0.22; 95% CI, 0.06–0.76) were significantly less likely to accept pre-marital HIV testing. In Buea males (AOR = 0.64 95% CI, 0.45–0.89) who would test HIV negative would be significantly less likely to accept to marry an HIV positive partner. In Buea, respondents who indicated a moderate risk of contracting HIV (AOR = 1.71; 95%CI, 1.09–2.66, p = 0.018) were significantly more likely to accept to marry an HIV positive partner. The major limitation of the study was that a hypothetical situation was used to ask respondents about their willingness to accept pre-marital HIV testing rather than actual HIV test acceptance. Conclusions Most respondents expressed their willingness to undergo pre-marital HIV testing. However, majority of respondents who would test HIV negative would refuse to marry their partner who tests HIV positive. These findings suggest that interventions to reduce HIV infection and fight against stigma and discrimination should be reinforced at community level."
https://openalex.org/W2905395437,"The shift of the Noncommunicable Diseases (NCDs) epidemic, including cardiovascular disease, from developed to Low and Middle Income Countries (LMIC), creates new challenges in contexts where there is poor information on healthcare costs. Clearly this information is essential for planning, and its relevance is even more valuable as a driver for prevention and control of NCDs. This paper begins to address that handicap by estimating the healthcare cost of Cardiovascular Disease (Coronary Heart Disease and Stroke) in Colombia, using a person-based approach. Results show that the annual healthcare cost of a person with Coronary Heart Disease is between INT$ 4,277 and INT$ 4,846, while the cost for a person with Stroke varies between INT$5,816 and INT$6,616. The expansion of the NCDs epidemic combined with such high costs threatens the financial sustainability of health systems; primary prevention and policies targeting structural and intermediate determinants of health are a promising way to make health systems financially sustainable."
https://openalex.org/W2904633429,"Broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs) are rarely elicited by current human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) vaccine designs, but the presence of bNAbs in naturally infected individuals may be associated with high plasma viral loads, suggesting that the magnitude, duration, and diversity of viral exposure may contribute to the development of bNAbs. Here, we report the isolation and characterization of a panel of human monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) from two subjects who developed broadly neutralizing autologous antibody responses during HIV-1 infection. In both subjects, we identified collections of mAbs that exhibited specificity only to a few autologous envelopes (Envs), with some mAbs exhibiting specificity only to a subset of Envs within the quasispecies of a particular sample at one time point. Neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) isolated from these subjects mapped mostly to epitopes in the Env V3 loop region and the CD4 binding site. None of the individual neutralizing mAbs recovered exhibited the cumulative breadth of neutralization present in the serum of the subjects. Surprisingly, however, the activity of polyclonal mixtures comprising individual mAbs that each possessed limited neutralizing activity, could achieve increased breadth of neutralizing activity against autologous isolates. While a single broadly neutralizing antibody targeting one epitope can mediate neutralization breadth, the findings presented here suggest that a cooperative polyclonal process mediated by diverse antibodies with more limited breadth targeting multiple epitopes also can achieve neutralization breadth against HIV-1."
https://openalex.org/W2905243777,"This study examined how classroom peer relations can be described in terms of the network of help relations among students, and the positions students take up in this help network, and whether the structure of adolescent classroom help networks and individual network positions were associated with academic achievement. Help networks were based on the peer nomination question ""Who helps you with problems?"" Building on previous studies on classroom climate and individual network position, higher academic achievement was expected in classrooms with: a dense help network; no or a few network isolates (referring to students that did not give or receive help at all); less segmentation in help relations; equally distributed help nominations. In addition, higher achievement was expected for individuals with more helpers and a more central position in the help network. Using the Dutch SNARE data (54 classrooms; 1,144 students), the multilevel models suggested that lower achievement was related to an unequal distribution of help relations in a classroom. Moreover, the centrality of individuals in the help network was linked to higher achievement. Classrooms varied strongly on network dimensions, and networks that would theoretically be expected to be most beneficial for achievement (with high density, a few isolates, low segmentation, and high equality) turned out to be highly uncommon. The findings demonstrated that subtle network processes were relevant for academic success, and that classroom network characteristics are associated with classroom-level variation in academic achievement. Descriptive results underlined the complexity of the social context of classrooms, and the absence of 'beneficial' classrooms suggests that researchers should adjust their notion of what is a beneficial or detrimental classroom environment for adolescents."
https://openalex.org/W2905409196,"This study was performed to evaluate the reliability and agreement of the IsoKai isokinetic lift test as it is currently administered in admission to the Swedish Armed Forces. The study included an intrarater (n = 534) and interrater reliability sample (n = 137), of Swedish male conscripts who performed the test on two test occasions about two hours apart. Two-to-four lifts were performed at each occasion, and the highest mean (IsoKaiMF) and peak force (IsoKaiPF) produced (N) were used for evaluation. All intraclass coefficients showed excellent reliability. The interrater analyses resulted in intraclass coefficients of 0.942 (95% CI; 0.920–0.959) and 0.858 (95% CI; 0.806–0.896) for the IsoKaiMF and IsoKaiPF, respectively, while the corresponding coefficients for the intrarater analyses were 0.935 (95% CI; 0.923–0.946) and 0.865 (95% CI; 0.842–0.886). Agreement, the capability of a test to detect changes, was assessed by the standard error of measurement (SEM/SEM%) and the smallest real difference (SRD/SRD%). These estimate indicated that it is possible to achieve measurements relevant to use in real practice with the IsoKai isokinetic lift test. Bland and Altman analyses revealed no systematic errors in either sample. Based on these findings, the IsoKai isokinetic lift test is suggested to be a highly reliable test for maximal dynamic muscular strength. The test could be of use in selection procedures in order to accurately evaluate maximal dynamic muscular strength, and for evaluating longitudinal changes in strength."
https://openalex.org/W2905188555,"Background Voluntary medical male circumcision has been promoted in high HIV prevalence settings to prevent HIV acquisition in males. However, the uptake of circumcision in many sub-Saharan African settings remains low. While many studies have measured circumcision prevalence, understanding circumcision incidence and its predictors is vital to achieving ambitious circumcision prevalence targets. Setting Rural KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. Methods We measured circumcision incidence over the period 2009–2014 in a longitudinal population-based cohort with high HIV prevalence and low circumcision prevalence. Multivariable survival models with Weibull distributions were used to assess socio-demographic, behavioral and biological predictors of circumcision incidence. Results Between 2009 and 2014, circumcision prevalence among males 15–49 years in the cohort increased from 3% to 24%. Among 6,203 males 15–49 years, 873 new circumcisions occurred over 13,678 person-years (incidence rate: 6.4/100 person-years, 95% CI 6.0–6.8). Circumcision incidence was substantially higher amongst young males: 15–19 year olds were twice as likely to circumcise as older males. In the survival model, shorter household distance to the nearest healthcare facility, knowledge of HIV status and biological HIV-negative status were associated with an increased likelihood of circumcision incidence. Conclusions Circumcision prevalence among males in rural KwaZulu-Natal remains well below South Africa’s national 80% coverage target across age groups. In this population, distance to the nearest healthcare facility and knowledge of HIV status were important independent predictors of circumcision incidence. Mobile circumcision clinics and innovative HIV testing services may be important tools to help achieve circumcision targets."
https://openalex.org/W2904299747,"If homonymous hemianopia develops in childhood it is frequently accompanied by strabismus. In some of these cases the strabismus increases the size of the binocular visual field. We determined how prevalent visual-field-expanding strabismus is in children who have homonymous hemianopia. Medical records were examined from 103 hemianopic patients with exotropia (XT) or esotropia (ET). For each participant, we determined whether their strabismus was in a direction that resulted in visual field expansion (i.e. left exotropia with left homonymous hemianopia). Ages at which hemianopia and strabismus were first noted were compared to determine which developed first. The prevalence of XT (24%) and ET (9%) with homonymous hemianopia were both much higher than in the general population (1.5% and 5%, respectively). More strabismic eyes pointed to the blind than seeing side (62 vs 41, 60% vs. 40%, p = 0.02). Exotropic eyes were five times more likely to point to the blind side than esotropic eyes (85% vs 15%). Strabismus, especially exotropia, is much more common in pediatric homonymous hemianopia than in the general population. The strabismus is significantly more often in a visual field-expanding direction. These results support an adaptive role for the strabismus. Patients with HH and exotropia or esotropia should be aware that their visual field could be reduced by strabismus surgery."
