https://openalex.org/W1981700549,"The traveling salesman problem is one of a class of difficult problems in combinatorial optimization that is representative of a large number of important scientific and engineering problems. A survey is given of recent applications and methods for solving large problems. In addition, an algorithm for the exact solution of the asymmetric traveling salesman problem is presented along with computational results for several classes of problems. The results show that the algorithm performs remarkably well for some classes of problems, determining an optimal solution even for problems with large numbers of cities, yet for other classes, even small problems thwart determination of a provably optimal solution."
https://openalex.org/W2085939458,"In the past decade there has been a gradual, but substantial change in our understanding of the physical nature of (2060) Chiron. Once thought to be the first known member of a population of asteroids orbiting between Saturn and Uranus, Chiron is now generally regarded as the largest known comet. The detection of CN emission in the spectrum of Chiron is reported. Not only do these observations underscore the cometary nature of Chiron, but, at a heliocentric distance exceeding 11 astronomical units, represent the most distant detection yet of a neutral gas species common in comets. These results are consistent with the outgassing from Chiron being primarily driven by isolated outbursts of CO(2) from a very small fraction of Chiron's surface. These may be indicative of primordial inhomogeneities."

https://openalex.org/W2018252538,"Asteroid 2060 Chiron is the largest known object exhibiting cometary activity. Radiometric observations made in 1983 from a ground-based telescope and the Infrared Astronomical Satellite are used to examine the limits on Chiron's diameter and albedo. It is argued that Chiron's surface temperature distribution at that time is best described by an ""isothermal latitude"" or ""rapid-rotator"" model. Consequently, Chiron has a maximum diameter of 372 kilometers and a minimum geometric albedo of 2.7%. This is much bigger and darker than previous estimates, and suggests that gravity may play a significant role in the evolution of gas and dust emissions. It is also found that for large obliquities, surface temperatures can vary dramatically on time scales of a decade, and that such geometry may play a critical role in explaining Chiron's observed photometric behavior since its discovery in 1977."
