https://openalex.org/W2156052062,"Objective A diagnosis of an autism spectrum disorders is usually associated with substantial lifetime costs to an individual, their family and the community. However, there remains an elusive factor in any cost-benefit analysis of ASD diagnosis, namely the cost of not obtaining a diagnosis. Given the infeasibility of estimating the costs of a population that, by its nature, is inaccessible, the current study compares expenses between families whose children received a formal ASD diagnosis immediately upon suspecting developmental atypicality and seeking advice, with families that experienced a delay between first suspicion and formal diagnosis. Design A register based questionnaire study covering all families with a child with ASD in Western Australia. Participants Families with one or more children diagnosed with an ASD, totalling 521 children diagnosed with an ASD; 317 records were able to be included in the final analysis. Results The median family cost of ASD was estimated to be AUD $34,900 per annum with almost 90% of the sum ($29,200) due to loss of income from employment. For each additional symptom reported, approximately $1,400 cost for the family per annum was added. While there was little direct influence on costs associated with a delay in the diagnosis, the delay was associated with a modest increase in the number of ASD symptoms, indirectly impacting the cost of ASD. Conclusions A delay in diagnosis was associated with an indirect increased financial burden to families. Early and appropriate access to early intervention is known to improve a child's long-term outcomes and reduce lifetime costs to the individual, family and society. Consequently, a per symptom dollar value may assist in allocation of individualised funding amounts for interventions rather than a nominal amount allocated to all children below a certain age, regardless of symptom presentation, as is the case in Western Australia."

Zhou et al. have determined the structure of a bacterial ribosome caught in the act of decoding an mRNA. Transfer RNAs (tRNAs) decipher the genetic code in the mRNA to ensure that the ribosome uses the correct amino acids. The structure shows tRNAs in the process of being moved between successive protein-building binding pockets as the ribosome reads the mRNA like a piece of old-fashion computer tape.

Tam et al. now show that complement C3, a protein that binds to pathogens in the blood, can enter target cells together with the pathogen. Once inside the cell, the presence of C3 triggers both immune signaling and degradation of the internalized pathogen. The discovery of this pathway reveals that cells possess an early warning system of invasion that works against a diverse array of pathogens and does not require recognition of any specific pathogen molecules.

https://openalex.org/W2092013755,"Similar to other complex systems in nature (e.g., a hunting pack, flocks of birds), sports teams have been modeled as social neurobiological systems in which interpersonal coordination tendencies of agents underpin team swarming behaviors. Swarming is seen as the result of agent co-adaptation to ecological constraints of performance environments by collectively perceiving specific possibilities for action (affordances for self and shared affordances). A major principle of invasion team sports assumed to promote effective performance is to outnumber the opposition (creation of numerical overloads) during different performance phases (attack and defense) in spatial regions adjacent to the ball. Such performance principles are assimilated by system agents through manipulation of numerical relations between teams during training in order to create artificially asymmetrical performance contexts to simulate overloaded and underloaded situations. Here we evaluated effects of different numerical relations differentiated by agent skill level, examining emergent inter-individual, intra- and inter-team coordination. Groups of association football players (national – NLP and regional-level – RLP) participated in small-sided and conditioned games in which numerical relations between system agents were manipulated (5v5, 5v4 and 5v3). Typical grouping tendencies in sports teams (major ranges, stretch indices, distances of team centers to goals and distances between the teams' opposing line-forces in specific team sectors) were recorded by plotting positional coordinates of individual agents through continuous GPS tracking. Results showed that creation of numerical asymmetries during training constrained agents' individual dominant regions, the underloaded teams' compactness and each team's relative position on-field, as well as distances between specific team sectors. We also observed how skill level impacted individual and team coordination tendencies. Data revealed emergence of co-adaptive behaviors between interacting neurobiological social system agents in the context of sport performance. Such observations have broader implications for training design involving manipulations of numerical relations between interacting members of social collectives."
https://openalex.org/W1991226287,"Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the FK506 binding protein 5 (FKBP5) gene combine with traumatic events to increase risk for post-traumatic stress and major depressive disorders (PTSD and MDD). These SNPs increase FKBP51 protein expression through a mechanism involving demethylation of the gene and altered glucocorticoid signaling. Aged animals also display elevated FKBP51 levels, which contribute to impaired resiliency to depressive-like behaviors through impaired glucocorticoid signaling, a phenotype that is abrogated in FKBP5-/- mice. But the age of onset and progressive stability of these phenotypes remain unknown. Moreover, it is unclear how FKBP5 deletion affects other glucocorticoid-dependent processes or if age-associated increases in FKBP51 expression are mediated through a similar epigenetic process caused by SNPs in the FKBP5 gene. Here, we show that FKBP51-mediated impairment in stress resiliency and glucocorticoid signaling occurs by 10 months of age and this increased over their lifespan. Surprisingly, despite these progressive changes in glucocorticoid responsiveness, FKBP5-/- mice displayed normal longevity, glucose tolerance, blood composition and cytokine profiles across lifespan, phenotypes normally associated with glucocorticoid signaling. We also found that methylation of Fkbp5 decreased with age in mice, a process that likely explains the age-associated increases in FKBP51 levels. Thus, epigenetic upregulation of FKBP51 with age can selectively impair psychological stress-resiliency, but does not affect other glucocorticoid-mediated physiological processes. This makes FKBP51 a unique and attractive therapeutic target to treat PTSD and MDD. In addition, aged wild-type mice may be a useful model for investigating the mechanisms of FKBP5 SNPs associated with these disorders."

Methods Using sensitive quantitative Real Time RT-PCR and sequencing, we detected novel HIV-derived miRNAs in the sera of HIV+ persons, and associated with exosomes. Release of TNFα by macrophages challenged with HIV miRNAs was measured by ELISA. Results HIV infection of primary alveolar macrophages produced elevated levels of viral microRNAs vmiR88, vmiR99 and vmiR-TAR in cell extracts and in exosome preparations from conditioned medium. Furthermore, these miRNAs were also detected in exosome fraction of sera from HIV-infected persons. Importantly, vmiR88 and vmiR99 (but not vmiR-TAR) stimulated human macrophage TNFα release, which is dependent on macrophage TLR8 expression. These data support a potential role for HIV-derived vmiRNAs released from infected macrophages as contributing to chronic immune activation in HIV-infected persons, and may represent a novel therapeutic target to limit AIDS pathogenesis. Conclusion Novel HIV vmiR88 and vmiR99 are present in the systemic circulation of HIV+ persons and could exhibit biological function (independent of gene silencing) as ligands for TLR8 signaling that promote macrophage TNFα release, and may contribute to chronic immune activation. Targeting novel HIV-derived miRNAs may represent a therapeutic strategy to limit chronic immune activation and AIDS progression."
https://openalex.org/W2108455760,"It is well known that atherosclerosis occurs geographically at branch points where disturbed flow predisposes to the development of plaque via triggering of oxidative stress and inflammatory reactions. In this study, we found that disturbed flow activated anti-oxidative reactions via up-regulating heme oxygenase 1 (HO-1) in an X-box-binding protein 1 (XBP1) and histone deacetylase 3 (HDAC3)-dependent manner. Disturbed flow concomitantly up-regulated the unspliced XBP1 (XBP1u) and HDAC3 in a VEGF receptor and PI3K/Akt-dependent manner. The presence of XBP1 was essential for the up-regulation of HDAC3 protein. Overexpression of XBP1u and/or HDAC3 activated Akt1 phosphorylation, Nrf2 protein stabilization and nuclear translocation, and HO-1 expression. Knockdown of XBP1u decreased the basal level and disturbed flow-induced Akt1 phosphorylation, Nrf2 stabilization, and HO-1 expression. Knockdown of HDAC3 ablated XBP1u-mediated effects. The mammalian target of rapamycin complex 2 (mTORC2) inhibitor, AZD2014, ablated XBP1u or HDAC3 or disturbed flow-mediated Akt1 phosphorylation, Nrf2 nuclear translocation, and HO-1 expression. Neither actinomycin D nor cycloheximide affected disturbed flow-induced up-regulation of Nrf2 protein. Knockdown of Nrf2 abolished XBP1u or HDAC3 or disturbed flow-induced HO-1 up-regulation. Co-immunoprecipitation assays demonstrated that XBP1u physically bound to HDAC3 and Akt1. The region of amino acids 201 to 323 of the HDAC3 protein was responsible for the binding to XBP1u. Double immunofluorescence staining revealed that the interactions between Akt1 and mTORC2, Akt1 and HDAC3, Akt1 and XBP1u, HDAC3, and XBP1u occurred in the cytosol. Thus, we demonstrate that XBP1u and HDAC3 exert a protective effect on disturbed flow-induced oxidative stress via up-regulation of mTORC2-dependent Akt1 phosphorylation and Nrf2-mediated HO-1 expression.

Under physiological conditions, cells can naturally establish homeostasis in response to different stimuli. Theoretically, the activation of oxidative stress under disturbed flow should be accompanied by the up-regulation of anti-oxidative mechanisms to maintain homeostasis within ECs. This may be a mechanism through which vascular integrity is maintained. The development of atherosclerosis could be a consequence of the disruption of the homeostasis by the intervention of other risk factors such as hyperlipidemia, diabetes, hypertension, smoking, and etc. (2Davies P.F.

Heme oxygenase 1 (HO-1) is an inducible isoform of the heme oxygenase family, which catalyzes the degradation of heme, producing biliverdin, iron, and carbon monoxide (4Kikuchi G. Yoshida T. Noguchi M. Heme oxygenase and heme degradation.Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2005; 338: 558-567Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). HO-1 was originally identified as a 32-kDa stress responsive protein to UV-irradiation, hydrogen peroxide, and sodium arsenite (5Keyse S.M. Tyrrell R.M. Heme oxygenase is the major 32-kDa stress protein induced in human skin fibroblasts by UVA radiation, hydrogen peroxide, and sodium arsenite.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1989; 86: 99-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (1108) Google Scholar). HO-1 is induced ubiquitously in cells in response to oxidative stress, hypoxia, heavy metal ions, cytokines, glutathione depletion, and etc. (6Siow R.C. Ishii T. Sato H. Taketani S. Leake D.S.

The induction of HO-1 and the derived carbon monoxide plays a protective role against cell apoptosis (7Brouard S. Berberat P.O. Tobiasch E. Seldon M.P. Bach F.H. Soares M.P.

Disruption of the HO-1gene (HMOX-1) does not affect mouse survival but increases end-organ damage and mortality during endotoxemia due to increased oxidative stress (8Wiesel P. Patel A.P. DiFonzo N.

In EC, HO-1 can be induced by both laminar flow and disturbed flow through oxidative stress and Nrf2 (NF-E2-related factor 2) activation (9Warabi E. Takabe W. Minami T. Inoue K. Itoh K. Yamamoto M.

The X-box binding protein 1 (XBP1) is also a stress responsive gene. In contrast to most stress responsive genes, XBP1 mRNA undergoes alternative splicing via inositol-requiring enzyme 1 α (IRE1α). This occurs in response to endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, resulting in an open reading frameshift (10Yoshida H. Matsui T. Yamamoto A. Okada T. Mori K.

XBP1 protein exists as 29-kDa unspliced (XBP1u) and 56-kDa spliced (XBP1s) isoforms. Both isoforms have an identical N-terminal dimerization domain and internal DNA binding domain but differ in the C terminus. XBP1s contains a transcriptional activation domain in the C terminus and functions as an intact transcription factor (10Yoshida H. Matsui T. Yamamoto A. Okada T. Mori K.

The majority of the previously described XBP1 functions are assigned to XBP1s. Our previous studies have demonstrated that XBP1s plays multiple roles in EC proliferation, autophagy response, and apoptosis (12Zeng L. Xiao Q. Chen M. Margariti A. Martin D. Ivetic A. Xu H.

The C terminus of XBP1u contains a signal for proteasome-mediated degradation, negatively regulating XBP1s function (15Yoshida H. Oku M. Suzuki M.

Cell Biol. 2006; 172: 565-575Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). There remains very little investigation into the role of XBP1u compared with XBP1s. Histone deacetylase 3 (HDAC3) is a class I HDAC (16de Ruijter A.J. van Gennip A.H. Caron H.N. Kemp S. van Kuilenburg A.B.

In this study, we found that HDAC3 cooperated with XBP1u to modulate HO-1 expression in response to disturbed flow. To scrutinize the molecular mechanisms of this process, the present study aims to clarify the role of XBP1 interaction with the partners in maintaining endothelial functions. We demonstrated that an interaction between XBP1 and HADC3 resulted in PI3K/Akt1 activation and HO-1 expression. This process is crucial for endothelial survival in response to oxidative stress.

Briefly, the disturbed flow was created by placing the flask on a platform shaker (Labnet, model Rocker 25) with parameters of 2.0-mm culture medium depth, 10-cm length flask, ± 7° rotating angle and frequency of 0.5 Hz (i.e. 2 s per cycle), respectively. Unshaken cells were kept for same duration as static control. For inhibitor assays, the inhibitors were included in culture medium for 1 h prior to flow and maintained during the flow process. HUVECs were challenged with 50 µmol/liter H2O2 for 24 h after 24 h post-infection with Ad-null or Ad-XBP1u virus at 10 MOI or with 20 µmol/liter H2O2 for 24 h after 72 h post-infection with non-target shRNA or XBP1 shRNA lentivirus at 10 MOI, followed by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide cell proliferation assay with the CellTiter 96 Aqueous One Solution Cell Proliferation assay kit according to the protocol provided (Promega). Briefly, 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide reagent was diluted at 1:4 with M199 containing 2% FBS, applied to HUVECs at 300 µl/well in 24-well plate and incubated at 37 °C for 30 min to 2 h. 300 µl/well of 0.2% SDS was then added to stop the reaction. The absorbance at A490 nm was measured with a laminator luminometer. The relative cell survival was defined as the ratio of A490 nm of the test group to that of control group with that of control group set as 1.0. Mouse embryonic fibroblasts were challenged with 50 µmol/liter H2O2 for 24 h, followed by apoptosis analysis using the Apo-Direct flow cytometry kit (Chemicon) with protocol provided. PBS was included as control. Briefly, the treated cells were detached with trypsin and fixed in solution with 1% paraformaldehyde on ice for 1 h and washed three times with PBS. The cell pellet was resuspended in 50 µl of staining solution (TdT reaction buffer, TdT enzyme, fluorescein-dUTP) and incubated for 60 min at 37 °C, with shaking every 15 min. The reaction was stopped through the addition of 1 ml of rinse buffer and washed three times with the rinse buffer. The cell pellet was resuspended in 500 µl of propidium iodide/RNase A solution and incubated in the dark at room temperature for 30 min, followed by flow cytometry analysis of fluorescence at 520 nm with a 488-nm Argon laser.

The segments were incubated with 0.5 ml of M199 medium plus 15% FBS containing no virus (control), empty virus (Ad-null), or Ad-XBP1u virus at 1 × 106 plaque-forming unit/ml in 24-well plate for 6 h. Three segments were included in each group. The virus solutions were then removed, and 1 ml of fresh medium was added to each well. Twenty-four hour post infection, the segments were treated with PBS or 50 µmol/liter H2O2 for 24 h. The segments were fixed with 4% formaldehyde and 1% glutaraldehyde in PBS for 5 min, followed by X-gal staining overnight (24Hu Y. Davison F. Zhang Z. Xu Q. Endothelial replacement and angiogenesis in arteriosclerotic lesions of allografts are contributed by circulating progenitor cells.Circulation. 2003; 108: 3122-3127Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). The segments were mounted on slide with vessel lumen face up. Images were assessed by Zeiss Axioplan 2 Imaging microscope with Plan-NEOPLUAR 20×/0.5 objective lenses, AxioCam camera and Axiovision software at room temperature and were processed by Adobe Photoshop software. Cell numbers were counted under the microscope. The relative cell number was defined as the ratio of cell numbers/mm2 of virus-infected group to that of uninfected control group with that of control set as 1.0.

HUVECs were seeded in 12-well plates at 5 × 104 cells/well 24 h prior to transfection. HDAC3-Luc (0.1 µg/well) vector was co-transfected with 0.1 µg/well pShuttle2-FLAG-XBP1s or -XBP1u expression vector into HUVECs with FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science). pGL3-Luc basic vector and grp78-luc vector were included as negative and positive luciferase vector control, respectively. pShuttle2-lacZ vector was used as an empty vector control. Renilla-Luc (0.05 µg/well) was included as an internal control. Forty-eight hours later, firefly and Renilla luciferase activity was assessed with respective assay kit (Promega). The relative luciferase activity was defined as the ratio of readout for firefly luciferase to that for Renilla luciferase with that of control group set as 1.0. Total cellular RNA was extracted using Qiagen RNeasy kit according to the protocol provided. Two microgram RNA was transcribed into cDNA using Improm-II reverse transcription system (Promega). Twenty nanogram cDNA (relative to RNA amount) was amplified by PCR with cyber green solution (Applied Biosystems) in a Sequence Detection System 7000 (Applied Biosystems). The primers were as follows: XBP1, 5′-agcactcagactacgtgcacct-3′ and 5′-tgcccaacag gatatcagactc-3′; HDAC3, 5′-catctctgctggtagaagagg-3′ and 5′-catcatagaactcattgggtg-3′; HMOX-1, 5′-gccagcaacaaagtgcaagatt-3′ and 5′-tgagtgtaaggacccatcggag-3′; Nrf2, 5′-cagtggatctgccaactactc-3′ and 5′-tggagaggatgctgctgaagg-3′; and 18s, 5′-cccagtaagtgcgggtcataa-3′ and 5′-ccgagggcctcactaaacc-3′. For adenoviral infection, HUVECs were incubated with Ad-null, Ad-HDAC3, or Ad-XBP1u virus at 10 MOI for 6 h and then cultured in fresh complete growth medium for time duration indicated in figure legends. For shRNA lentiviral infection, HUVECs were incubated with 100 transduction unit/cell of non-target shRNA or XBP1 shRNA or IRE1α shRNA or HDAC3 shRNA lentiviruses in the presence of 10 mg/ml polybrene for 16 h, followed by culture in fresh complete growth medium for 72 h, and subjected to further treatments. Human Nrf2 siRNA (sc-37030) was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology and reconstituted accordingly. For siRNA transfection assay, HUVECs in 75-ml flasks were transfected with 50 µl of 10 µmol/liter control siRNA or Nrf2 siRNA together with 50 µl of Lipofectamine RNAimax (Invitrogen) according to protocol provided. For virus infection assays, 48 h post-transfection, the cells were infected with 10 MOI Ad-null, Ad-XBP1u or Ad-HDAC3 viruses and incubated for 24 h, followed by Western blot analysis. For shear stress assays, 72 h post-transfection, the cells were subjected to disturbed flow for 4 h, followed by Western blot analysis. Immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting were performed according to standard procedures described elsewhere. One milligram lysate was used for immunoprecipitation, whereas 25 µg was used for input or direct immunoblotting. For unconjugated antibody, 2 µg of antibody and 10 µl of protein G beads (Sigma) were used for one immunoprecipitation assay. For agarose-conjugated antibody, 10 µl of such beads were directly used for each immunoprecipitation assay. Immunofluorescence staining was performed using standard procedures. Briefly, adenovirus-infected or uninfected HUVECs were seeded on 0.04% gelatin-coated glass slides with or without flow treatment. The cells were fixed with methanol and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100, blocked with 5% normal swine serum, incubated with primary antibodies, followed by incubation with Alexa Fluor 488- or 594-labeled secondary antibodies and counterstaining with DAPI. Images were taken by using SP5 confocal microscope (Leica) and were processed by Adobe Photoshop software. Magnification was indicated in figures. HUVECs were infected with Ad-null, Ad-XBP1u, or Ad-HDAC3 at 10 MOI for 6 h and incubated for another 18 h. Fresh medium containing DMSO or 5 µmol/liter AZD2014 were added and incubated for 24 h. The cytosol and nuclear extracts were harvested with procedures described previously (12Zeng L. Xiao Q. Chen M. Margariti A. Martin D. Ivetic A. Xu H. Mason J. Wang W. Cockerill G. Mori K. Li J.Y.

Chromatin immunoprecipitation was performed with ChIP assay kit (17-295, Millipore) according to the protocol provided. Briefly, HUVECs were subjected to disturbed flow for 2 h, followed by the ChIP assay. Rabbit anti-XBP1u and anti-XBP1s were used, and normal rabbit IgG was included as negative control. Six sets of primer pairs were used to cover the 1.5-kb HDAC3 promoter region (GenBankTM accession no. AB457579.1). The sequences include the following: position +1 ∼ −276, 5′-ccacggtcttggccatggtgc-3′ versus 5′-tcggcttcccgaggatctgac-3′; position −276 ∼ −520, 5′-tcagatcctcgggaagccgag-3′ versus 5′-gtttgggtccgggtaggggac-3′; position −520 ∼ −720, 5′-cccctacccggacccaaactc-3′ versus 5′-gctgagagcggtggcaggctc-3′; position −720 ∼ −960, 5′-gagcctgccaccgctctcagc-3′ versus 5′-ttctcccaccctgaccacctg-3′; position −960 ∼ −1195, 5′-gccaggtggtcagggtgggag-3′ versus 5′-agctctctaccacgaccatgg-3′; position −1195 ∼ −1467, 5′-accatggtcgtggtagagagc-3′ versus 5′-aagagcatatatagcccatgttgg-3′. Routine PCR was performed using these primer sets to amplified XBP1u- or XBP1s-bound DNA fragment.

https://openalex.org/W1984066790,"Histone H3K4 methylation has been linked to transcriptional activation. KDM5A (also known as RBP2 or JARID1A), a member of the KDM5 protein family, is an H3K4 demethylase, previously implicated in the regulation of transcription and differentiation. Here, we show that KDM5A is physically and functionally associated with two histone deacetylase complexes. Immunoaffinity purification of KDM5A confirmed a previously described association with the SIN3B-containing histone deacetylase complex and revealed an association with the nucleosome remodeling and deacetylase (NuRD) complex. Sucrose density gradient and sequential immunoprecipitation analyses further confirmed the stable association of KDM5A with these two histone deacetylase complexes. KDM5A depletion led to changes in the expression of hundreds of genes, two-thirds of which were also controlled by CHD4, the NuRD catalytic subunit. Gene ontology analysis confirmed that the genes commonly regulated by both KDM5A and CHD4 were categorized as developmentally regulated genes. ChIP analyses suggested that CHD4 modulates H3K4 methylation levels at the promoter and coding regions of target genes. We further demonstrated that the Caenorhabditis elegans homologues of KDM5 and CHD4 function in the same pathway during vulva development. These results suggest that KDM5A and the NuRD complex cooperatively function to control developmentally regulated genes."

Casz1 is required for Xenopus heart ventral midline progenitor cell differentiation. Whether Casz1 plays a role during mammalian heart development is unknown. Our aim is to determine 1p36 gene CASZ1 function at regulating heart development in mammals. We generated a Casz1 knock-out mouse using Casz1-trapped embryonic stem cells. Casz1 deletion in mice resulted in abnormal heart development including hypoplasia of myocardium, ventricular septal defect, and disorganized morphology. Hypoplasia of myocardium was caused by decreased cardiomyocyte proliferation. Comparative genome-wide RNA transcriptome analysis of Casz1 depleted embryonic hearts identifies abnormal expression of genes that are critical for muscular system development and function, such as muscle contraction genes TNNI2, TNNT1, and CKM; contractile fiber gene ACTA1; and cardiac arrhythmia associated ion channel coding genes ABCC9 and CACNA1D. The transcriptional regulation of some of these genes by Casz1 was also found in cellular models. Our results showed that loss of Casz1 during mouse development led to heart defect including cardiac noncompaction and ventricular septal defect, which phenocopies 1p36 deletion syndrome related CHD.

Here we report that Casz1 is critical for murine heart development. We find that Casz1 deletion leads to abnormal cardiac gene expression and causes reduced cardiomyocyte proliferation, a ventricular septal defect and defective cardiac morphogenesis that ultimately led to heart failure and embryonic lethality. Our results demonstrate that Casz1 is required for normal mammalian heart development and function. The 129 OLA Casz1 trapped murine embryonic stem cells (Sanger CJ0565) were used to establish Casz1 knock-out mouse. The Casz1 gene trap inserted a βgeo reporter after Casz1 exon 9 and was sequence verified. The embryonic stem cells were injected into C57BL6 blastocysts, and the chimeras were bred to C57BL6 wild type to generate mixed 129/C57BL6 mice as described previously (19.Reid S.W. Tessarollo L. Isolation, microinjection and transfer of mouse blastocysts.Methods Mol. Biol. 2009; 530: 269-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The characterization of Casz1 mutant mice was performed by PCR using genomic DNA as template or reverse transcriptase PCR using cDNA as template. The primer sequences were listed in Table 1.

In brief, to extract protein from heart, whole hearts were dissected from E14.5 embryos and dissolved in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer. Protein was extracted using Bioruptor sonicator with protein extraction beads at high power for 10 cycles (30 s on and 30 s off). Proteins were electrophoresed in a 4–20% polyacrylamide gel (Bio-Rad) and transferred electrophoretically to nitrocellulose membranes (Schleicher & Schuell). Rabbit anti-GAPDH (Santa Cruz, 1:4000) and rabbit anti-Casz1 (Rockland, 1:1000) were used to detect GAPDH and Casz1 protein level in heart. To extract protein from human cardiac fibroblasts, cells were lysed in Laemmli buffer 5 days after CASZ1b transfection. Forty micrograms of protein lysate was loaded onto gels to assess CASZ1 protein levels. Membrane has been probed with CASZ1 antibody (polyclonal, 1:500 Santa Cruz) and α-tubulin antibody (monoclonal, 1:4000 Cell Signaling). Total RNA was extracted from Casz1+/+ and Casz1βgeo/βgeo hearts at E12.5, or human cardiac fibroblast cells, or mouse HL-1 cardiomyocytes using the RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen) as per the manufacturer's protocol.

Open table in a new tab Affymetrix Mouse MO gene 2.0 ST arrays were used to determine genes regulated by Casz1 in embryonic murine hearts. Total RNA was extracted from three Casz1+/+ and three Casz1βgeo/βgeo hearts at E12.5. Among these hearts, one Casz1+/+ heart and one Casz1βgeo/βgeo heart were from the same litter as a pair, and hearts from three different litters were used as biological replicates. Array hybridization, chemiluminescence detection, and image acquisition were performed by Laboratory of Molecular Technology of NCI-Frederick core facility. Raw CEL files were uploaded onto Partek Genomics Suite v6.6 for data analysis. A Fisher's test was applied to identify differently expressed features by comparing Casz1βgeo/βgeo and Casz1+/+ samples. The filter thresholds for a p value of <0.05 and an absolute fold change of 1.5 were imposed to retrieve a list of significantly differentially expressed genes. The differentially expressed genes were uploaded onto ingenuity pathway analysis (IPA) for further data analysis. Statistical analyses of the data were performed using a t test or CHITEST with p < 0.05 considered significant. The values in the graphs are expressed as means ± S.D. or S.E. The statistical tests were two-sided. Casz1 gene encodes two major isoforms: full-length Casz1a and a shorter isoform Casz1b, with both isoforms sharing the same 5′-proximal “promoter” region and the first 16 exons. In the Casz1 knock-out mouse, the Casz1 gene trap inserts a βgeo reporter after Casz1 exon 9 (Fig. 1A), resulting in a truncated Casz1 allele in which 10 of the 11 zinc fingers of full-length Casz1 are lost. The zinc fingers are critical domains for Casz1 function (14.Virden R.A. Thiele C.J. Liu Z. Characterization of critical domains within the tumor suppressor CASZ1 required for transcriptional regulation and growth suppression.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2012; 32: 1518-1528Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Using primers specific for the WT (Casz1+/+) allele and the trapped allele, we found that Casz1+/+ mice only have the unaltered Casz1 allele, whereas Casz1 heterozygous (Casz1+/βgeo) mice have both the WT allele and the trapped allele (Fig. 1B). Among 183 progeny of male Casz1+/βgeo and female Casz1+/βgeo mice, 63 (35.4%) mice are WT (Casz1+/+) and 120 (64.6%) mice are heterozygous (Casz1+/βgeo), but none are homozygous (Casz1βgeo/βgeo). This indicates that Casz1 mutation in both alleles results in embryonic lethality. Timed mating results showed that the embryonic lethality occurred at E17.5; no live Casz1βgeo/βgeo embryos were observed after E17.5. To determine the role of Casz1 during embryogenesis, we first investigated the expression pattern of Casz1 during embryonic development. In Casz1 trapped embryos, the βgeo reporter was under the control of endogenous Casz1, and therefore X-gal staining or anti-β-galactosidase staining could be used to characterize the pattern of Casz1 expression during embryonic development. Whole mount X-gal staining of E9.5 embryos showed that Casz1 was expressed in the neural tube and heart (Fig. 1C, left panel), which was consistent with previously reported in situ hybridization analysis results (10.Vacalla C.M. Theil T. Cst, a novel mouse gene related to Drosophila Castor, exhibits dynamic expression patterns during neurogenesis and heart development.Mech. Dev. 2002; 118: 265-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Transverse sectioning showed that Casz1 was expressed in the hindbrain and dorsal aspect of the spinal cord, as well as in cardiomyocytes of the heart (Fig. 1C, right panel). Whole mount X-gal staining of E12.5 embryos showed that Casz1 was expressed in the eye, dorsomedial telencephalon, cranial ganglia, nasal placode, somite, neural tube, and heart (Fig. 1, D and E). To confirm the expression of Casz1 in the heart, total RNA was extracted from the entire heart of E12.5 embryos, and real time PCR was performed using primers that only recognize the wild type allele but not the trapped allele. Consistent with X-gal staining, real time PCR results showed that Casz1 mRNA was expressed in the heart (Fig. 1F). Endogenous Casz1 mRNA was detected in the heart of Casz1+/+ embryos, a half amount of Casz1 mRNA level was detected in the heart of the Casz1+/βgeo embryo, and the Casz1 mRNA level was undetectable in the heart of the Casz1βgeo/βgeo embryo. Gata4, an early cardiac marker, was expressed at similar levels in these hearts (Fig. 1F). Western blot analysis of E14.5 hearts using an anti-Casz1 antibody demonstrated the protein expression of both Casz1a and Casz1b isoforms in WT hearts but not in Casz1βgeo/βgeo heart, confirming the deficiency of Casz1 in the knock-out mouse (Fig. 1G).

The correct assembly, stability, and mechanical properties of this matrix, which are crucial for successful ovulation, transport of the COC to the oviduct, and its fertilization, depend on the interaction between HA and specific HA-organizing proteins. Although the proteins inter-α-inhibitor (IαI), pentraxin 3 (PTX3), and TNF-stimulated gene-6 (TSG-6) have been identified as being critical for COC matrix formation, its supramolecular organization and the molecular mechanism of COC matrix stabilization remain unknown. Here we used films of end-grafted HA as a model system to investigate the molecular interactions involved in the formation and stabilization of HA matrices containing TSG-6, IαI, and PTX3. We found that PTX3 binds neither to HA alone nor to HA films containing TSG-6. This long pentraxin also failed to bind to products of the interaction between IαI, TSG-6, and HA, among which are the covalent heavy chain (HC)·HA and HC·TSG-6 complexes, despite the fact that both IαI and TSG-6 are ligands of PTX3. Interestingly, prior encounter with IαI was required for effective incorporation of PTX3 into TSG-6-loaded HA films. Moreover, we demonstrated that this ternary protein mixture made of IαI, PTX3, and TSG-6 is sufficient to promote formation of a stable (i.e. cross-linked) yet highly hydrated HA matrix. We propose that this mechanism is essential for correct assembly of the COC matrix and may also have general implications in other inflammatory processes that are associated with HA cross-linking.

This paper investigates psycho-social correlates of extra mitigation behavior in response to climate change, while also testing for potential (unobserved) heterogeneity in European citizens' decision-making. A person's extra mitigation behavior in response to climate change is conceptualized—and differentiated from common mitigation behavior—as some people's broader and greater levels of behavioral engagement (compared to others) across specific self-reported mitigation actions and behavioral domains. Regression analyses highlight the importance of environmental psychographics (i.e., attitudes, motivations, and knowledge about climate change) and socio-demographics (especially country-level variables) in understanding extra mitigation behavior. By looking at the data through the lens of segmentation, significant heterogeneity is uncovered in the associations of attitudes and knowledge about climate change—but not in motivational or socio-demographic links—with extra mitigation behavior in response to climate change, across two groups of environmentally active respondents. The study has implications for promoting more ambitious behavioral responses to climate change, both at the individual level and across countries."
https://openalex.org/W2038435685,"Rapid, flexible reconfiguration of connections across brain regions is thought to underlie successful cognitive control. Two intrinsic networks in particular, the cingulo-opercular (CO) and fronto-parietal (FP), are thought to underlie two operations critical for cognitive control: task-set maintenance/tonic alertness and adaptive, trial-by-trial updating. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging, we directly tested whether the functional connectivity of the CO and FP networks was related to cognitive demands and behavior. We focused on working memory because of evidence that during working memory tasks the entire brain becomes more integrated. When specifically probing the CO and FP cognitive control networks, we found that individual regions of both intrinsic networks were active during working memory and, as expected, integration across the two networks increased during task blocks that required cognitive control. Crucially, increased integration between each of the cognitive control networks and a task-related, non-cognitive control network (the hand somatosensory-motor network; SM) was related to increased accuracy. This implies that dynamic reconfiguration of the CO and FP networks so as to increase their inter-network communication underlies successful working memory."
https://openalex.org/W1966454287,"Late-stage or post-market identification of adverse drug reactions (ADRs) is a significant public health issue and a source of major economic liability for drug development. Thus, reliable in silico screening of drug candidates for possible ADRs would be advantageous. In this work, we introduce a computational approach that predicts ADRs by combining the results of molecular docking and leverages known ADR information from DrugBank and SIDER. We employed a recently parallelized version of AutoDock Vina (VinaLC) to dock 906 small molecule drugs to a virtual panel of 409 DrugBank protein targets. L1-regularized logistic regression models were trained on the resulting docking scores of a 560 compound subset from the initial 906 compounds to predict 85 side effects, grouped into 10 ADR phenotype groups. Only 21% (87 out of 409) of the drug-protein binding features involve known targets of the drug subset, providing a significant probe of off-target effects. As a control, associations of this drug subset with the 555 annotated targets of these compounds, as reported in DrugBank, were used as features to train a separate group of models. The Vina off-target models and the DrugBank on-target models yielded comparable median area-under-the-receiver-operating-characteristic-curves (AUCs) during 10-fold cross-validation (0.60-0.69 and 0.61-0.74, respectively). Evidence was found in the PubMed literature to support several putative ADR-protein associations identified by our analysis. Among them, several associations between neoplasm-related ADRs and known tumor suppressor and tumor invasiveness marker proteins were found. A dual role for interstitial collagenase in both neoplasms and aneurysm formation was also identified. These associations all involve off-target proteins and could not have been found using available drug/on-target interaction data. This study illustrates a path forward to comprehensive ADR virtual screening that can potentially scale with increasing number of CPUs to tens of thousands of protein targets and millions of potential drug candidates."
https://openalex.org/W2003900223,"Background Prostaglandins (PGs) mediate insect immune responses to infections and invasions. Although the presence of PGs has been confirmed in several insect species, their biosynthesis in insects remains a conundrum because orthologs of the mammalian cyclooxygenases (COXs) have not been found in the known insect genomes. PG-mediated immune reactions have been documented in the beet armyworm, Spodoptera exigua. The purpose of this research is to identify the source of PGs in S. exigua. Principal Findings Peroxidases (POXs) are a sister group of COX genes. Ten putative POXs (SePOX-A ∼ SePOX-J) were expressed in S. exigua. Expressions of SePOX-F and -H were induced by bacterial challenge and expressed in the hemocytes and the fat body. RNAi of each POX was performed by hemocoelic injection of their specific double-stranded RNAs. dsPOX-F or, separately, dsPOX-H, but not the other eight dsRNA constructs, specifically suppressed hemocyte-spreading behavior and nodule formation; these two reactions were also inhibited by aspirin, a COX inhibitor. PGE2, but not arachidonic acid, treatment rescued the immunosuppression. Sequence analysis indicated that both POX genes were clustered with peroxinectin (Pxt) and their cognate proteins shared some conserved domains corresponding to the Pxt of Drosophila melanogaster. Conclusions SePOX-F and -H are Pxt-like genes associated with PG biosynthesis in S. exigua."
https://openalex.org/W2051655725,"Chimpanzees confer benefits on group members, both in the wild and in captive populations. Experimental studies of how animals allocate resources can provide useful insights about the motivations underlying prosocial behavior, and understanding the relationship between task design and prosocial behavior provides an important foundation for future research exploring these animals' social preferences. A number of studies have been designed to assess chimpanzees' preferences for outcomes that benefit others (prosocial preferences), but these studies vary greatly in both the results obtained and the methods used, and in most cases employ procedures that reduce critical features of naturalistic social interactions, such as partner choice. The focus of the current study is on understanding the link between experimental methodology and prosocial behavior in captive chimpanzees, rather than on describing these animals' social motivations themselves. We introduce a task design that avoids isolating subjects and allows them to freely decide whether to participate in the experiment. We explore key elements of the methods utilized in previous experiments in an effort to evaluate two possibilities that have been offered to explain why different experimental designs produce different results: (a) chimpanzees are less likely to deliver food to others when they obtain food for themselves, and (b) evidence of prosociality may be obscured by more “complex” experimental apparatuses (e.g., those including more components or alternative choices). Our results suggest that the complexity of laboratory tasks may generate observed variation in prosocial behavior in laboratory experiments, and highlights the need for more naturalistic research designs while also providing one example of such a paradigm."
https://openalex.org/W2327641451,"Background and Objectives Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) are important regulators of insulin secretion, and their functional loss is an early characteristic of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Pharmacological levels of GLP-1, but not GIP, can overcome this loss. GLP-1 and GIP exert their insulinotropic effects through their respective receptors expressed on pancreatic β-cells. Both the GLP-1 receptor (GLP-1R) and the GIP receptor (GIPR) are members of the secretin family of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) and couple positively to adenylate cyclase. We compared the signalling properties of these two receptors to gain further insight into why GLP-1, but not GIP, remains insulinotropic in T2DM patients. Methods GLP-1R and GIPR were transiently expressed in HEK-293 cells, and basal and ligand-induced cAMP production were investigated using a cAMP-responsive luciferase reporter gene assay. Arrestin3 (Arr3) recruitment to the two receptors was investigated using enzyme fragment complementation, confocal microscopy and fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET). Results GIPR displayed significantly higher (P<0.05) ligand-independent activity than GLP-1R. Arr3 displayed a robust translocation to agonist-stimulated GLP-1R but not to GIPR. These observations were confirmed in FRET experiments, in which GLP-1 stimulated the recruitment of both GPCR kinase 2 (GRK2) and Arr3 to GLP-1R. These interactions were not reversed upon agonist washout. In contrast, GIP did not stimulate recruitment of either GRK2 or Arr3 to its receptor. Interestingly, arrestin remained at the plasma membrane even after prolonged (30 min) stimulation with GLP-1. Although the GLP-1R/arrestin interaction could not be reversed by agonist washout, GLP-1R and arrestin did not co-internalise, suggesting that GLP-1R is a class A receptor with regard to arrestin binding. Conclusions GIPR displays higher basal activity than GLP-1R but does not effectively recruit GRK2 or Arr3."
https://openalex.org/W2097114050,"Objective Previous studies have suggested that C-reactive protein (CRP) was associated with risk of stroke. There were few studies in Asian population, or on stroke subtypes other than ischemic stroke. We thus investigated the relationship between CRP and the risks of all stroke and its subtypes in a Chinese adult population. Methods In the current study, we included 90,517 Chinese adults free of stroke and myocardial infarction at baseline (June 2006 to October 2007) in analyses. Strokes were classified as ischemic stroke (IS), intracranial heamorrhage (ICH) and subarachnoid heamorrhage (SAH). High-sensitivity CRP (hs-CRP) were categorized into three groups: <1 mg/L, 1 to 3 mg/L, and >3 mg/L. Cox proportional hazards regression was used to calculate the association between hs-CRP concentrations and all stroke, as well as its subtypes. Results During a median follow-up time of 49 months, we documented 1,472 incident stroke cases. Of which 1,049 (71.3%) were IS, 383 (26.0%) were ICH, and 40 (2.7%) were SAH. After multivariate adjustment, hs-CRP concentrations ≥1 mg/L were associated with increased risks of all stroke (hs-CRP 1–3 mg/L: hazard ratio (HR) 1.17, 95% confidential interval (CI) 1.03–1.33; hs-CRP>3 mg/L: HR 1.25, 95% CI 1.07–1.46) and IS (hs-CRP 1–3 mg/L: HR 1.17, 95% CI 1.01–1.36; hs-CRP>3 mg/L: HR 1.33, 95% CI 1.11–1.60), but not with ICH and SAH. Subgroup analyses showed that higher hs-CRP concentration was more prone to be a risk factor for all stroke and IS in non-fatal stroke, male and hypertensive participants. Conclusion We found that higher hs-CRP concentrations were associated with a higher risk of IS, particularly for non-fatal stroke, male and hypertensive subjects. In contrast, we did not observe significant associations between hs-CRP and ICH/SAH."
https://openalex.org/W2165799666,"Proximal spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is an early onset, autosomal recessive motor neuron disease caused by loss of or mutation in SMN1 (survival motor neuron 1). Despite understanding the genetic basis underlying this disease, it is still not known why motor neurons (MNs) are selectively affected by the loss of the ubiquitously expressed SMN protein. Using a mouse embryonic stem cell (mESC) model for severe SMA, the RNA transcript profiles (transcriptomes) between control and severe SMA (SMN2+/+;mSmn-/-) mESC-derived MNs were compared in this study using massively parallel RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq). The MN differentiation efficiencies between control and severe SMA mESCs were similar. RNA-Seq analysis identified 3,094 upregulated and 6,964 downregulated transcripts in SMA mESC-derived MNs when compared against control cells. Pathway and network analysis of the differentially expressed RNA transcripts showed that pluripotency and cell proliferation transcripts were significantly increased in SMA MNs while transcripts related to neuronal development and activity were reduced. The differential expression of selected transcripts such as Crabp1, Crabp2 and Nkx2.2 was validated in a second mESC model for SMA as well as in the spinal cords of low copy SMN2 severe SMA mice. Furthermore, the levels of these selected transcripts were restored in high copy SMN2 rescue mouse spinal cords when compared against low copy SMN2 severe SMA mice. These findings suggest that SMN deficiency affects processes critical for normal development and maintenance of MNs."
https://openalex.org/W2090447313,"Patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models generated from surgical specimens are gaining popularity as preclinical models of cancer. However, establishment of PDX lines from small cell lung cancer (SCLC) patients is difficult due to very limited amount of available biopsy material. We asked whether SCLC cells obtained from endobronchial ultrasound-guided transbronchial needle aspiration (EBUS-TBNA) could generate PDX lines that maintained the phenotypic and genetic characteristics of the primary tumor. Following successful EBUS-TBNA sampling for diagnostic purposes, we obtained an extra sample for cytologic analysis and implantation into the flanks of immunodeficient mice. Animals were monitored for engraftment for up to 6 months. Histopathologic and immunohistochemical analysis, and targeted next-generation re-sequencing, were then performed in both the primary sample and the derivative PDX line. A total of 12 patients were enrolled in the study. EBUS-TBNA aspirates yielded large numbers of viable tumor cells sufficient to inject between 18,750 and 1,487,000 cells per flank, and to yield microgram quantities of high-quality DNA. Of these, samples from 10 patients generated xenografts (engraftment rate 83%) with a mean latency of 104 days (range 63–188). All but one maintained a typical SCLC phenotype that closely matched the original sample. Identical mutations that are characteristic of SCLC were identified in both the primary sample and xenograft line. EBUS-TBNA has the potential to be a powerful tool in the development of new targeting strategies for SCLC patients by providing large numbers of viable tumor cells suitable for both xenografting and complex genomic analysis."
https://openalex.org/W1968827373,"The CFTR channel is an essential mediator of electrolyte transport across epithelial tissues. CFTR opening is promoted by ATP binding and dimerization of its two nucleotide binding domains (NBDs). Phosphorylation of its R domain (e.g. by PKA) is also required for channel activity. The CFTR structure is unsolved but homology models of the CFTR closed and open states have been produced based on the crystal structures of evolutionarily related ABC transporters. These models predict the formation of a tetrahelix bundle of intracellular loops (ICLs) during channel opening. Here we provide evidence that residues E267 in ICL2 and K1060 in ICL4 electrostatically interact at the interface of this predicted bundle to promote CFTR opening. Mutations or a thiol modifier that introduced like charges at these two positions substantially inhibited ATP-dependent channel opening. ATP-dependent activity was rescued by introducing a second site gain of function (GOF) mutation that was previously shown to promote ATP-dependent and ATP-independent opening (K978C). Conversely, the ATP-independent activity of the K978C GOF mutant was inhibited by charge- reversal mutations at positions 267 or 1060 either in the presence or absence of NBD2. The latter result indicates that this electrostatic interaction also promotes unliganded channel opening in the absence of ATP binding and NBD dimerization. Charge-reversal mutations at either position markedly reduced the PKA sensitivity of channel activation implying strong allosteric coupling between bundle formation and R domain phosphorylation. These findings support important roles of the tetrahelix bundle and the E267-K1060 electrostatic interaction in phosphorylation-dependent CFTR gating."
https://openalex.org/W2086971948,"Synapses, the basic units of communication in the brain, require complex molecular machinery for neurotransmitter release and reception. Whereas numerous components of excitatory postsynaptic sites have been identified, relatively few proteins are known that function at inhibitory postsynaptic sites. One such component is neuroligin-2 (NL2), an inhibitory synapse-specific cell surface protein that functions in cell adhesion and synaptic organization via binding to neurexins. In this study, we used a transgenic tandem affinity purification and mass spectrometry strategy to isolate and characterize NL2-associated complexes. Complexes purified from brains of transgenic His6-FLAG-YFP-NL2 mice showed enrichment in the Gene Ontology terms cell-cell signaling and synaptic transmission relative to complexes purified from wild type mice as a negative control. In addition to expected components including GABA receptor subunits and gephyrin, several novel proteins were isolated in association with NL2. Based on the presence of multiple components involved in trafficking and endocytosis, we showed that NL2 undergoes dynamin-dependent endocytosis in response to soluble ligand and colocalizes with VPS35 retromer in endosomes. Inhibitory synapses in brain also present a particular challenge for imaging. Whereas excitatory synapses on spines can be imaged with a fluorescent cell fill, inhibitory synapses require a molecular tag. We find the His6-FLAG-YFP-NL2 to be a suitable tag, with the unamplified YFP signal localizing appropriately to inhibitory synapses in multiple brain regions including cortex, hippocampus, thalamus, and basal ganglia. Altogether, we characterize NL2-associated complexes, demonstrate regulated trafficking of NL2, and provide tools for further proteomic and imaging studies of inhibitory synapses."
https://openalex.org/W2135628847,"Background Inadequate water and sanitation during childbirth are likely to lead to poor maternal and newborn outcomes. This paper uses existing data sources to assess the water and sanitation (WATSAN) environment surrounding births in Tanzania in order to interrogate whether such estimates could be useful for guiding research, policy and monitoring initiatives. Methods We used the most recent Tanzania Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) to characterise the delivery location of births occurring between 2005 and 2010. Births occurring in domestic environments were characterised as WATSAN-safe if the home fulfilled international definitions of improved water and improved sanitation access. We used the 2006 Service Provision Assessment survey to characterise the WATSAN environment of facilities that conduct deliveries. We combined estimates from both surveys to describe the proportion of all births occurring in WATSAN-safe environments and conducted an equity analysis based on DHS wealth quintiles and eight geographic zones. Results 42.9% (95% confidence interval: 41.6%–44.2%) of all births occurred in the woman's home. Among these, only 1.5% (95% confidence interval: 1.2%–2.0%) were estimated to have taken place in WATSAN-safe conditions. 74% of all health facilities conducted deliveries. Among these, only 44% of facilities overall and 24% of facility delivery rooms were WATSAN-safe. Combining the estimates, we showed that 30.5% of all births in Tanzania took place in a WATSAN-safe environment (range of uncertainty 25%–42%). Large wealth-based inequalities existed in the proportion of births occurring in domestic environments based on wealth quintile and geographical zone. Conclusion Existing data sources can be useful in national monitoring and prioritisation of interventions to improve poor WATSAN environments during childbirth. However, a better conceptual understanding of potentially harmful exposures and better data are needed in order to devise and apply more empirical definitions of WATSAN-safe environments, both at home and in facilities."

In endothelial cells, histamine induces Ca2+ mobilization by releasing Ca2+ from the endoplasmic reticulum and eliciting Ca2+ entry across the plasma membrane.

RNA interference against STIM1 or Orai1, the activating subunit and the pore-forming subunit of CRAC channels, respectively, abolishes this histamine-evoked Ca2+ entry. Furthermore, overexpression of dominant-negative CRAC channel subunits inhibits while co-expression of both STIM1 and Orai1 enhances histamine-induced Ca2+ influx. Interestingly, gene silencing of STIM1 or Orai1 also interrupts the activation of calcineurin/nuclear factor of activated T-cells (NFAT) pathway and the production of interleukin 8 triggered by histamine in HUVECs. Collectively, these results suggest a central role of STIM1 and Orai1 in mediating Ca2+ mobilization linked to inflammatory signaling of endothelial cells upon histamine stimulation.

https://openalex.org/W1966528949,"Dysregulation of lipid homeostasis is a common feature of several major human diseases, including type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease. However, because of the complex nature of lipid metabolism, the regulatory mechanisms remain poorly defined at the molecular level. As the key transcriptional activators of lipogenic genes, such as fatty acid synthase (FAS), sterol regulatory element-binding proteins (SREBPs) play a pivotal role in stimulating lipid biosynthesis. Several studies have shown that SREBPs are regulated by the NAD(+)-dependent histone deacetylase SIRT1, which forms a complex with the lysine-specific histone demethylase LSD1. Here, we show that LSD1 plays a role in regulating SREBP1-mediated gene expression. Multiple lines of evidence suggest that LSD1 is required for SREBP1-dependent activation of the FAS promoter in mammalian cells. LSD1 knockdown decreases SREBP-1a at the transcription level. Although LSD1 affects nuclear SREBP-1 abundance indirectly through SIRT1, it is also required for SREBP1 binding to the FAS promoter. As a result, LSD1 knockdown decreases triglyceride levels in hepatocytes. Taken together, these results show that LSD1 plays a role in regulating lipogenic gene expression, suggesting LSD1 as a potential target for treating dysregulation of lipid metabolism."
https://openalex.org/W2049516644,"Yersinia adhesin A (YadA) belongs to a class of bacterial adhesins that form trimeric structures. Their mature form contains a passenger domain and a C-terminal β-domain that anchors the protein in the outer membrane (OM). Little is known about how precursors of such proteins cross the periplasm and assemble into the OM. In the present study we took advantage of the evolutionary conservation in the biogenesis of β-barrel proteins between bacteria and mitochondria. We previously observed that upon expression in yeast cells, bacterial β-barrel proteins including the transmembrane domain of YadA assemble into the mitochondrial OM. In the current study we found that when expressed in yeast cells both the monomeric and trimeric forms of full-length YadA were detected in mitochondria but only the trimeric species was fully integrated into the OM. The oligomeric form was exposed on the surface of the organelle in its native conformation and maintained its capacity to adhere to host cells. The co-expression of YadA with a mitochondria-targeted form of the bacterial periplasmic chaperone Skp, but not with SurA or SecB, resulted in enhanced levels of both forms of YadA. Taken together, these results indicate that the proper assembly of trimeric autotransporter can occur also in a system lacking the lipoproteins of the BAM machinery and is specifically enhanced by the chaperone Skp."
https://openalex.org/W2065745631,"Background and Objectives Elevated levels of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-9 have been associated with the metabolic syndrome (MetS) and cardiovascular events. The MMP-9 −1562 C/T polymorphism has furthermore been shown as a risk factor for coronary artery disease (CAD). The non-favourable cardiometabolic state in MetS may increase the risk. We aimed to investigate the influence of MMP-9 −1562 C/T polymorphism in subjects with CAD and MetS. Methods Patients (n = 1000) with verified CAD stratified in Mets +/− (n = 244/756), were analyzed for the MMP-9 −1562 C/T polymorphism and related to clinical events after 2 years follow-up. Serum levels of total MMP-9 and tissue inhibitor of matrix metalloproteinases (TIMP)-1were analyzed in all, whereas MMP-9 activity, extracellular matrix metalloproteinase inducer (EMMPRIN), and expression of the two genes were analyzed in a subset of 240 randomly selected patients. Results Totally, 106 clinical endpoints were recorded. In MetS; the T-allele associated with 5.5 fold increase in event rate (p<0.0001), increased with number of MetS components, a 117% increase in total MMP-9 levels (TT homozygous, p = 0.05), significantly higher total- and endogenous active MMP-9 and TIMP-1 levels (p<0.01 all), and EMMPRIN was inversely correlated with pro- and endogenous active MMP-9 (p<0.05, both). In non-MetS; the T-allele was not associated with new events, nor higher MMP-9 levels. EMMPRIN was significantly correlated with total MMP-9 and TIMP-1 (p<0.01, both) and the two genes were inter-correlated (p<0.001). Conclusion In CAD patients with MetS, the MMP-9 T-allele increased the risk of clinical events, probably mediated through elevated MMP-9 levels and altered MMP-9 regulation."
https://openalex.org/W1990758318,"Purpose To investigate the prognostic significance of squamous and/or glandular differentiation in urothelial carcinoma (UC). Materials and Methods Among 800 consecutive patients who underwent radical cystectomy or nephroureterectomy at our institution from January 1990 to December 2010, 696 patients were included for the analysis. Clinicopathologic variables were compared according to the presence of squamous and/or glandular differentiation and the tumor location. Results A total of 51 (7.3%) patients had squamous and/or glandular differentiation. Patients with squamous and/or glandular differentiation had higher pathological T stage (p<0.001) and grade (p<0.001) than those with pure form of UC. After the median follow-up of 55.2 months, 84 (24.6%) and 82 (23.1%) died of upper urinary tract UC and UC of bladder, respectively. Patients with squamous and/or glandular differentiation in upper urinary tract UC showed poorer cancer-specific survival (CSS) (p<0.001) and overall survival (OS) (p<0.001) than those with pure form in upper urinary tract UC (p<0.001), but not in UC of bladder (p = 0.178 for CSS and p = 0.172 for OS). On multivariate Cox regression analysis, squamous and/or glandular differentiation was an independent predictor of CSS (hazard ratio [HR] 1.76; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.08–2.85, p = 0.023), but it was not associated with OS (HR 1.52; 95% CI 1.00–2.32, p = 0.051). Conclusions The presence of variant histology could be associated with poorer survival outcome in patients with UC. Squamous and/or glandular differentiation is associated with features of biologically aggressive disease and an independent predictor of CSS."
https://openalex.org/W2026213073,"Dipeptidyl peptidase-like protein 6 (DPP6) is an auxiliary subunit of the Kv4 family of voltage-gated K(+) channels known to enhance channel surface expression and potently accelerate their kinetics. DPP6 is a single transmembrane protein, which is structurally remarkable for its large extracellular domain. Included in this domain is a cysteine-rich motif, the function of which is unknown. Here we show that this cysteine-rich domain of DPP6 is required for its export from the ER and expression on the cell surface. Disulfide bridges formed at C349/C356 and C465/C468 of the cysteine-rich domain are necessary for the enhancement of Kv4.2 channel surface expression but not its interaction with Kv4.2 subunits. The short intracellular N-terminal and transmembrane domains of DPP6 associates with and accelerates the recovery from inactivation of Kv4.2, but the entire extracellular domain is necessary to enhance Kv4.2 surface expression and stabilization. Our findings show that the cysteine-rich domain of DPP6 plays an important role in protein folding of DPP6 that is required for transport of DPP6/Kv4.2 complexes out of the ER."

Ten single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) were genotyped in 1200 participants (352 Crohn's disease, 400 ulcerative colitis, and 448 healthy controls) using Sequenom MassARRAY iPLEX. Disease associations were evaluated for each of the ten SNPs.Thirty one mutations were identified in the IRGM gene, of which two had not hitherto been reported (150226250- ss947429272 & 150227858- ss947429273). Ten SNPs (6 from the above and 4 from the literature) were evaluated. Significant associations with Crohn's disease were noted with the T allele of rs1000113 (OR 1.46, 95% CI 1.12-1.90), T allele of rs9637876 (OR 1.25, 95% CI 1.005-1.561) and C allele of rs 13361189 (OR 1.33, 95% CI 1.07-1.669). Two SNPs--rs11747270 and rs180802994--did not exhibit Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium but were associated with both Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis in this population. The remaining SNPs did not show significant associations with either Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis.Association of IRGM gene SNPs with Crohn's disease is reported for the first time in Indian patients. We also report, for the first time, an association of rs 9637876 in the IRGM gene with Crohn's disease."

Restitution of interhemispheric balance is thought to contribute to post-stroke recovery. Longitudinal measurements of cerebral blood flow (CBF) changes might act as surrogate marker for this process.To quantify longitudinal CBF changes using arterial spin labeling MRI (ASL) and interhemispheric balance within the cortical sensorimotor network and to assess their relationship with motor hand function recovery.Longitudinal CBF data were acquired in 23 patients at 3 and 9 months after cortical sensorimotor stroke and in 20 healthy controls using pulsed ASL. Recovery of grip force and manual dexterity was assessed with tasks requiring power and precision grips. Voxel-based analysis was performed to identify areas of significant CBF change. Region-of-interest analyses were used to quantify the interhemispheric balance across nodes of the cortical sensorimotor network.Dexterity was more affected, and recovered at a slower pace than grip force. In patients with successful recovery of dexterous hand function, CBF decreased over time in the contralesional supplementary motor area, paralimbic anterior cingulate cortex and superior precuneus, and interhemispheric balance returned to healthy control levels. In contrast, patients with poor recovery presented with sustained hypoperfusion in the sensorimotor cortices encompassing the ischemic tissue, and CBF remained lateralized to the contralesional hemisphere.Sustained perfusion imbalance within the cortical sensorimotor network, as measured with task-unrelated ASL, is associated with poor recovery of dexterous hand function after stroke. CBF at rest might be used to monitor recovery and gain prognostic information."

MCR-subtypes have been detected in cartilage and bone and mediate an increasing number of effects in diathrodial joints. This study aims to determine the role of MC1-receptors (MC1) in joint physiology and pathogenesis of osteoarthritis (OA) using MC1-signaling deficient mice (Mc1re/e). OA was surgically induced in Mc1re/e and wild-type (WT) mice by transection of the medial meniscotibial ligament. Histomorphometry of Safranin O stained articular cartilage was performed with non-operated controls (11 weeks and 6 months) and 4/8 weeks past surgery. µCT–analysis for assessing epiphyseal bone architecture was performed as a longitudinal study at 4/8 weeks after OA-induction. Collagen II, ICAM-1 and MC1 expression was analysed by immunohistochemistry. Mc1re/e mice display less Safranin O and collagen II stained articular cartilage area compared to WT prior to OA-induction without signs of spontaneous cartilage surface erosion. This MC1-signaling deficiency related cartilage phenotype persisted in 6 month animals. At 4/8 weeks after OA-induction cartilage erosions were increased in Mc1re/e knees paralleled by weaker collagen II staining. Prior to OA-induction, Mc1re/e mice do not differ from WT with respect to bone parameters. During OA, Mc1re/e mice developed more osteophytes and had higher epiphyseal bone density and mass. Trabecular thickness was increased while concomitantly trabecular separation was decreased in Mc1re/e mice. Numbers of ICAM-positive chondrocytes were equal in non-operated 11 weeks Mc1re/e and WT whereas number of positive chondrocytes decreased during OA-progression. Unchallenged Mc1re/e mice display smaller articular cartilage covered area without OA-related surface erosions indicating that MC1-signaling is critical for proper cartilage matrix integrity and formation. When challenged with OA, Mc1re/e mice develop a more severe OA-pathology. Our data suggest that MC1-signaling protects against cartilage degradation and subchondral bone sclerosis in OA indicating a beneficial role of the POMC system in joint pathophysiology."
https://openalex.org/W2029990247,"Gradual depletion of the world petroleum reserves and the impact of environmental pollution highlight the importance of developing alternative energy resources such as plant biomass. To address these issues, intensive research has focused on the plant Jatropha curcas, which serves as a rich source of biodiesel because of its high seed oil content. However, producing biodiesel from Jatropha generates large amounts of biomass waste that are difficult to use. Therefore, the objective of our research was to analyze the effects of different conditions of torrefaction on Jatropha biomass. Six different types of Jatropha tissues (seed coat, kernel, stem, xylem, bark, and leaf) were torrefied at four different temperature conditions (200°C, 250°C, 300°C, and 350°C), and changes in the metabolite composition of the torrefied products were determined by Fourier transform-infrared spectroscopy and nuclear magnetic resonance analyses. Cellulose was gradually converted to oligosaccharides in the temperature range of 200°C–300°C and completely degraded at 350°C. Hemicellulose residues showed different degradation patterns depending on the tissue, whereas glucuronoxylan efficiently decomposed between 300°C and 350°C. Heat-induced depolymerization of starch to maltodextrin started between 200°C and 250°C, and oligomer sugar structure degradation occurred at higher temperatures. Lignin degraded at each temperature, e.g., syringyl (S) degraded at lower temperatures than guaiacyl (G). Finally, the toxic compound phorbol ester degraded gradually starting at 235°C and efficiently just below 300°C. These results suggest that torrefaction is a feasible treatment for further processing of residual biomass to biorefinery stock or fertilizer."

PPARγ plays an important role in the differentiation of adipocytes as well as in energy metabolism (11.Spiegelman B.M. Puigserver P. Wu Z.

PPARγ coactivator 1α (PGC-1α), although originally discovered as a cold-inducible protein in brown adipose tissue, functions as a master regulator of mitochondrial biogenesis in different tissues including skeletal muscle and fat (12.Puigserver P.

When ectopically produced in white adipocytes, it increases the number of mitochondria and activates the expression of some brown fat-specific genes (13.Puigserver P. Wu Z. Park C.W. Graves R.

Conversely, adipocyte-specific ablation of the PGC-1α gene renders the mice insulin-resistant accompanied by a reduction in the expression of genes involved in thermogenesis and mitochondrial biogenesis (15.Kleiner S.

Acetylation of PGC-1α inhibits its transcriptional activity, and Sirt1 is a protein lysine deacetylase responsible for removing acetyl groups from PGC-1α, thereby activating the protein (16.Rodgers J.T. Lerin C. Haas W. Gygi S.P. Spiegelman B.M. Puigserver P. Nutrient control of glucose homeostasis through a complex of PGC-1α and SIRT1.Nature. 2005; 434: 113-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (2563) Google Scholar). Because Sirt1 functions in an NAD+-dependent manner, it acts as a sensor for the cellular redox balance of NAD+ and NADH+, which closely correlates with metabolic fluxes (17.Yang T. Fu M. Pestell R.

Sirtuins as regulators of metabolism and healthspan.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2012; 13: 225-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar). Therefore, the regulation of PGC-1α activity by Sirt1 directly connects metabolic perturbations with transcriptional events that impact mitochondrial biogenesis. Moreover, the PGC-1α gene is known to be positively auto-regulated such that Sirt1-mediated posttranslational activation of PGC-1α could lead to an elevation of PGC-1α transcription (19.Handschin C. Rhee J. Lin J. Tarr P.T. Spiegelman B.M. An autoregulatory loop controls peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ coactivator 1α expression in muscle.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2003; 100: 7111-7116Crossref PubMed Scopus (583) Google Scholar). Additional transcription factors have also been implicated in the regulation of energy metabolism. For example, the four Id proteins, which contain the helix-loop-helix motif and inhibit the function of E protein transcription factors (20.Sun X.H. Multitasking of helix-loop-helix proteins in lymphopoiesis.Adv. Immunol. 2004; 84: 43-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 21.Kee B.L. E and ID proteins branch out.Nat. Rev.

Although Id proteins are typically thought to play an inhibitory role in differentiation, studies have interestingly suggested that Id2 and Id4 have a role in promoting adipogenesis. In vitro induction of adipogenesis in preadipocytes with the standard adipogenic mixture of dexamethasone, 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine, and insulin rapidly but transiently induces the expression of Id2 and Id4 (23.Park K.W.

This is accompanied by a reduction in PPARγ and adipocyte protein 2 expression and, in Id4−/− mice, a significant reduction in fat mass compared with littermate controls (23.Park K.W. Waki H.

Id3, on the other hand, has been shown to inhibit the transcription of the adiponectin gene, which encodes an adipocyte specific hormone whose levels are inversely correlated with obesity and insulin resistance and has protective effects against metabolic disorders (26.Doran A.C. Meller N. Cutchins A. Deliri H. Slayton R.P. Oldham S.N. Kim J.B. Keller S.R. McNamara C.A. The helix-loop-helix factors Id3 and E47 are novel regulators of adiponectin.Circ. Res. 2008; 103: 624-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Id3 also promotes adipose tissue growth by facilitating angiogenesis through VEGF factor A expression (27.Cutchins A. Harmon D.B. Kirby J.L. Doran A.C. Oldham S.N. Skaflen M. Klibanov A.L. Meller N. Keller S.R. Garmey J. McNamara C.A. Inhibitor of differentiation-3 mediates high fat diet-induced visceral fat expansion.Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2012; 32: 317-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Id1−/− mice have also been shown to have decreased body weight and fat mass (22.Satyanarayana A. Klarmann K.D. Gavrilova O. Keller J.R. Ablation of the transcriptional regulator Id1 enhances energy expenditure, increases insulin sensitivity, and protects against age- and diet-induced insulin resistance, and hepatosteatosis.FASEB J. 2012; 26: 309-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). These mice maintained insulin sensitivity after a high fat diet (HFD) treatment and had increased oxygen consumption and expression of thermogenic markers such as UCP1 and PGC1α in brown fat (22.Satyanarayana A. Klarmann K.D. Gavrilova O. Keller J.R.

This suggests that the difference in fat mass was due to an increase in energy expenditure and thermogenesis. Intriguingly, Akerfeldt and Laybutt (28.Akerfeldt M.C. Laybutt D.R. Inhibition of Id1 augments insulin secretion and protects against high-fat diet-induced glucose intolerance.Diabetes. 2011; 60: 2506-2514Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) reported that Id1 deficiency resulted in augmented insulin secretion and protection against HFD-induced glucose intolerance without observing any difference between wild type and Id1−/− mice in weight gain due to a high fat diet. One possible explanation of the discrepancy between these two reports is the mixed genetic background of Id1−/− mice used in both studies, which could result in variations in different mouse colonies. We have now examined the role of Id1 in energy metabolism by using a different strain of Id1 deficient mice on C57/BL6 background. More importantly, we have investigated the underlying molecular mechanisms. Here we report that Id1 deficiency renders the animals resistant to diet- and age-induced obesity and glucose intolerance. One of the remarkable phenotypes of the Id1−/− mice is the smaller size of visceral white adipocytes compared with wild type controls after feeding with a high fat diet. This was correlated with a significant difference in the expression of genes involved in energy metabolism such as Sirt1 and PGC-1α. Furthermore, by expressing an E protein gain-of-function mutant in adipocytes, we obtained evidence to suggest that elevation of E protein function in adipocytes due to loss of Id1 contributes to the resistance to diet-induced obesity. C57BL/6J mice were originally purchased from The Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME). Generation of the enhanced GFP knockin Id1 knock-out mice (Id1−/−) and ROSA26-ET2 mice and their backcrossing onto the C57BL/6J background were previously described (29.Cochrane S.W. Zhao Y.

Fabp4-cre mice were originally generated by the laboratory of Dr. R. Evans (Salk Institute) (31.He W. Barak Y. Hevener A. Olson P. Liao D. Le J. Nelson M. Ong E. Olefsky J.M. Evans R.M.

Mice were handled and experiments were conducted in accordance with pre-approved protocols by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee and maintained in the Laboratory Animal Research Center at the Oklahoma Medical Research Foundation. Mice were maintained on standard chow diet (PicoLab Rodent Diet 20, Labdiet, St. Louis, MO). Mice placed on a high or low fat diet (60% kcal fat; D12492 or 10% kcal fat, D12450B, Research Diets, New Brunswick, NJ) were switched from a regular diet at 8 weeks of age and maintained on that diet for up to 4 months for Id1−/− mice and 2 months for Fabp4/ET2 mice. Food was given ad libitum for all mice, and weight was measured weekly. Mice were switched to a HFD at the age of 8 weeks, and 2 weeks later their drinking water was replaced with a 0.5 mg/ml BrdU plus 1% sucrose solution in water. White adipose tissue was collected after 6 weeks of BrdU labeling and fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin. Tissues were embedded in paraffin and sectioned at 8 µm. Sections were incubated with primary mouse anti-BrdU antibody (BD Pharmingen) and secondary peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch) followed by development with a DAB kit (Vector Laboratories) and counterstained with hematoxylin. Brown preadipocytes were isolated from 1-day-old pups adapted from a protocol of the Kahn and co-workers (32.Fasshauer M. Klein J. Ueki K. Kriauciunas K.M. Benito M. White M.F. Kahn C.R.

Briefly, the interscapular brown fat pad was dissected out and minced with a razor blade in 500 µl of sterile PBS. The tissue pieces were digested with 1.5 mg of collagenase type I in 1 ml of isolation buffer (0.123 m NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1.3 mm CaCl2, 5 mm glucose, 100 mm HEPES, and 4% BSA) while shaking at 300 cycles/min at 37 °C and vortexed for 10 s every 5 min for 30 min. The solution was filtered through an 80-µm nylon mesh to remove large undigested tissue, and the cells were washed with culture medium to remove the collagenase. Cells were cultured overnight at 500,000 cells/ml in a 37 °C incubator with 5% CO2. The following day the adherent cells were gently washed once with DMEM and continued to culture for an additional 2 days. The cells were then trypsinized and plated at 200,000 cells/ml and allowed to reach 100% confluency. Cells were held at this state for 2 days then induced with the standard adipogenic differentiation mixture consisting of 5 µg/ml insulin, 0.25 mm dexamethasone, and 0.5 mm 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (IBMX) in culture medium. Two days later the differentiation medium was removed, and culture medium with 5 µg/ml insulin was added. Cells were cultured for a total of 8–10 days to allow complete differentiation. The cells were stained with Oil Red O. Cohorts of wild type and Id1-deficient mice at different ages on chow or a high fat diet were fasted for 16 h and then weighed. Base-line blood glucose was measured by tail vein bleeding using a OneTouch glucose meter. A single dose of glucose (0.8 g/kg body weight) was administered intraperitoneally, which was followed by sampling blood at different time points to measure blood glucose. Blood was collected from cohorts of mice of different genotypes after a 16-h fasting. Insulin levels were measured using a rat/mouse insulin ELISA kit (catalogue #EZRMI-13K, Millipore, Billerica, MA) according to the manufacturer's instruction. Tissues were homogenized in TRIzol (Invitrogen), and cDNA was synthesized with the Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). RT-PCR was performed on the ABI Prism 7500 (Applied Biosystems). Relative mRNA expression was determined using the −ΔΔCT method with β-actin as an internal control.

Open table in a new tab Mice were weighed immediately before the scan, and total body fat content was measured under anesthesia using a dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry system (Lunar PIXImus2, GE Lunar Corp., Madison, WI). This system uses software that has been reported to require additional modification to improve the accuracy of fat content quantification (20.Sun X.H. Multitasking of helix-loop-helix proteins in lymphopoiesis.Adv. Immunol. 2004; 84: 43-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), which was included in the current analysis. Percent body fat was measured as body fat content, excluding the head, divided by total body mass. Energy expenditure was measured by indirect calorimetry in WT and Id1−/− mice fed either a chow diet or a HFD. Animals were acclimated to the testing cages and metabolic cabinet for 48 h before data collection with ad libitum access to food and water. After acclimation, oxygen consumption and carbon dioxide production were measured using a multiple animal respirometry system (MARS) (Sable Systems, Las Vegas, NV). 10-min/animal averages were collected hourly over a continuous 20-h period. The respiratory exchange ratio was calculated as the ratio of the average carbon dioxide produced to oxygen consumed over this time period. Energy expenditure was calculated as described by Tschöp et al. (34.Tschöp M. Smiley D.L. Heiman M.L. Ghrelin induces adiposity in rodents.Nature. 2000; 407: 908-913Crossref PubMed Scopus (3383) Google Scholar) using the caloric equivalent of oxygen. Data were initially subdivided into the light or dark phase time periods to evaluate potential differences in metabolic responses associated with different activity levels. Light and dark phase values were then averaged to report results. Rates of energy expenditure were normalized to either total body mass or lean body mass as determined by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry analysis. Magnetic resonance images were acquired on a 7-tesla, 30-cm horizontal bore USR Bruker system equipped with an AVANCE I console. A quadrature coil of 150-mm inner diameter and 266 mm in length matched and tuned to 300 MHz was used for pulse transmission and signal detection. A RARE (rapid acquisition with relaxation enhancement) image sequence was used with a repetition time of 1300 ms, an echo time of 15 ms, 25 contiguous horizontal slices of 1 mm thickness, a 70 × 40-mm field of view, and a 384 × 256 image matrix. Scans were acquired yielding a water-suppressed image that provided contrast between adipose tissue regions and regions having a typically low fat content as previously described (35.Garteiser P. Doblas S. Towner R.A. Griffin T.M.

A Mathematica (Version 6.0; Wolfram Research, Champaign, IL) notebook was developed to calculate the percent body fat/mouse body volume (35.Garteiser P. Doblas S. Towner R.A. Griffin T.M.

Average values are presented as the mean ± S.D., and a Student's t test (two-tail) was used to establish significance if the p value was <0.05. We previously generated an Id1 knock-out mouse strain in which the Id1 gene was disrupted by the insertion of the GFP coding sequence and backcrossed it onto the C57BL/6 background (30.Perry S.S. Zhao Y. Nie L. Cochrane S.W. Huang Z. Sun X.H. Id1, but not Id3, directs long-term repopulating hematopoietic stem-cell maintenance.Blood. 2007; 110: 2351-2360Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). We noticed that these mice were slightly smaller than their wild type littermates and followed up by monitoring the weight gain after feeding cohorts of mice a diet with 60% of the calories derived from fat. Two-month-old mice were maintained on this diet and weighed weekly for 8 weeks (Fig. 1A). Wild type mice gained weight at a significantly faster pace than Id1−/− mice. Although wild type mice were 15% heavier than Id1-deficient mice at the beginning of the treatment, they weighed ∼30% more 8 weeks later. In contrast, when the mice were put on a diet with 10% of calories generated from fat, no significant difference in weight gain between wild type and Id1−/− mice was observed (Fig. 1B). Examination of these mice on HFD using magnetic resonance imaging revealed a significantly higher fat content in wild type mice compared with Id1-deficient mice (Fig. 1C). Lean body mass and whole body adiposity were also determined by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry before and after being fed a HFD (Fig. 1D). Before a HF diet we did not observe any differences in lean body mass or percent body fat. In contrast, after HFD feeding, both lean body mass and percent body fat were lower in Id1−/− mice compared with wild type controls (Fig. 1D). The difference in body mass between wild type mice and Id1−/− mice was primarily due to differences in body fat content rather than lean body mass. We next determined the effect of Id1 deficiency"
https://openalex.org/W1975570568,"Established linguistic theoretical frameworks propose that alphabetic language speakers use phonemes as phonological encoding units during speech production whereas Mandarin Chinese speakers use syllables. This framework was challenged by recent neural evidence of facilitation induced by overlapping initial phonemes, raising the possibility that phonemes also contribute to the phonological encoding process in Chinese. However, there is no evidence of non-initial phoneme involvement in Chinese phonological encoding among representative Chinese speakers, rendering the functional role of phonemes in spoken Chinese controversial. Here, we addressed this issue by systematically investigating the word-initial and non-initial phoneme repetition effect on the electrophysiological signal using a picture-naming priming task in which native Chinese speakers produced disyllabic word pairs. We found that overlapping phonemes in both the initial and non-initial position evoked more positive ERPs in the 180- to 300-ms interval, indicating position-invariant repetition facilitation effect during phonological encoding. Our findings thus revealed the fundamental role of phonemes as independent phonological encoding units in Mandarin Chinese."
https://openalex.org/W2001654518,"The present article reports the development of soft nanohybrids comprising of single walled carbon nanotube (SWCNT) included silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) having superior antibacterial property. In this regard aqueous dispersing agent of carbon nanotube (CNT) containing a silver ion reducing unit was synthesised by the inclusion of tryptophan and tyrosine within the backbone of the amphiphile. The dispersions were characterized spectroscopically and microscopically using TEM, AFM and Raman spectroscopy. The nanotube-nanoparticle conjugates were prepared by the in situ photoreduction of AgNO3. The phenolate residue and the indole moieties of tyrosine and tryptophan, respectively reduces the sliver ion as well as acts as stabilizing agents for the synthesized AgNPs. The nanohybrids were characterized using TEM and AFM. The antibacterial activity of the nanohybrids was studied against Gram-positive (Bacillus subtilis and Micrococcus luteus) and Gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli and Klebsiella aerogenes). The SWCNT dispersions showed moderate killing ability (40–60%) against Gram-positive bacteria however no antibacterial activity was observed against the Gram negative ones. Interestingly, the developed SWCNT-amphiphile-AgNP nanohybrids exhibited significant killing ability (∼90%) against all bacteria. Importantly, the cell viability of these newly developed self-assemblies was checked towards chinese hamster ovarian cells and high cell viability was observed after 24 h of incubation. This specific killing of bacterial cells may have been achieved due to the presence of higher –SH containing proteins in the cell walls of the bacteria. The developed nanohybrids were subsequently infused into tissue engineering scaffold agar-gelatin films and the films similarly showed bactericidal activity towards both kinds of bacterial strains while allowing normal growth of eukaryotic cells on the surface of the films."
https://openalex.org/W2027930539,"The Drosophila and plant (maize) functional counterparts of the abundant vertebrate chromosomal protein HMGB1 (HMG-D and ZmHMGB1, respectively) differ from HMGB1 in having a single HMG box, as well as basic and acidic flanking regions that vary greatly in length and charge. We show that despite these variations, HMG-D and ZmHMGB1 exist in dynamic assemblies in which the basic HMG boxes and linkers associate with their intrinsically disordered, predominantly acidic, tails in a manner analogous to that observed previously for HMGB1. The DNA-binding surfaces of the boxes and linkers are occluded in ""auto-inhibited"" forms of the protein, which are in equilibrium with transient, more open structures that are ""binding-competent."" This strongly suggests that the mechanism of auto-inhibition may be a general one. HMG-D and ZmHMGB1 differ from HMGB1 in having phosphorylation sites in their tail and linker regions. In both cases, in vitro phosphorylation of serine residues within the acidic tail stabilizes the assembled form, suggesting another level of regulation for interaction with DNA, chromatin, and other proteins that is not possible for the uniformly acidic (hence unphosphorylatable) tail of HMGB1."
https://openalex.org/W2017569297,"Footpad infection of C3HeB/FeJ mice with Leishmania amazonensis leads to chronic lesions accompanied by large parasite loads. Co-infecting these animals with L. major leads to induction of an effective Th1 immune response that can resolve these lesions. This cross-protection can be recapitulated in vitro by using immune cells from L. major-infected animals to effectively activate L. amazonensis-infected macrophages to kill the parasite. We have shown previously that the B cell population and their IgG2a antibodies are required for effective cross-protection. Here we demonstrate that, in contrast to L. major, killing L. amazonensis parasites is dependent upon FcRγ common-chain and NADPH oxidase-generated superoxide from infected macrophages. Superoxide production coincided with killing of L. amazonensis at five days post-activation, suggesting that opsonization of the parasites was not a likely mechanism of the antibody response. Therefore we tested the hypothesis that non-specific immune complexes could provide a mechanism of FcRγ common-chain/NADPH oxidase dependent parasite killing. Macrophage activation in response to soluble IgG2a immune complexes, IFN-γ and parasite antigen was effective in significantly reducing the percentage of macrophages infected with L. amazonensis. These results define a host protection mechanism effective during Leishmania infection and demonstrate for the first time a novel means by which IgG antibodies can enhance killing of an intracellular pathogen."
https://openalex.org/W2041572739,"Ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament of the cervical spine (OPLL) is characterized by the replacement of ligament tissues with ectopic bone formation, and this result is strongly affected by genetic and local factors. Two single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of rs2273073 (T/G) and rs235768 (A/T) of bone morphogenetic protein 2 (BMP2) gene which are associated with OPLL have been reported in our previous report. In this study, we confirmed the connection in 18 case samples analysis of BMP2 gene in OPLL patients; additionally, it was also shown from the OPLL patients with ligament tissues that enchondral ossification and expression of BMP2 were significantly higher compared with the non-OPLL patients by histological examination, immunohistochemistry and Western blotting analysis. To investigate the underlying mechanism, we studied the effect of SNPs in cell model. The C3H10T1/2 cells with different BMP2 gene variants were constructed and then subjected to uniaxial cyclic stretch (0.5 Hz, 10% stretch). In the presence of mechanical stress, the expression of BMP2 protein in C3H10T1/2 cells transfected by BMP2 (rs2273073 (T/G)) and BMP2 (rs2273073 (T/G), rs235768 (A/T)) were significantly higher than the corresponding static groups (P<0.05). In conclusion, these results suggested that BMP2 gene variant of rs2273073 (T/G) could not only increase cell susceptibility to bone transformation similar to pre-OPLL change, but also increase the sensibility to mechanical stress which might play an important role during the progression of OPLL."
https://openalex.org/W1973737654,"Tolerance is a well described component of alcohol abuse and addiction. The large conductance voltage- and Ca(2+)-gated potassium channel (BK) has been very useful for studying molecular tolerance. The influence of association with the β4 subunit can be observed at the level of individual channels, action potentials in brain slices, and finally, drinking behavior in the mouse. Previously, we showed that 50 mm alcohol increases both α and αβ4 BK channel open probability, but only α BK develops acute tolerance to this effect. Currently, we explore the possibility that the influence of the β4 subunit on tolerance may result from a striking effect of β4 on kinase modulation of the BK channel. We examine the influence of the β4 subunit on PKA, CaMKII, and phosphatase modulation of channel activity, and on molecular tolerance to alcohol. We record from human BK channels heterologously expressed in HEK 293 cells composed of its core subunit, α alone (Insertless), or co-expressed with the β4 BK auxiliary subunit, as well as, acutely dissociated nucleus accumbens neurons using the cell-attached patch clamp configuration. Our results indicate that BK channels are strongly modulated by activation of specific kinases (PKA and CaMKII) and phosphatases. The presence of the β4 subunit greatly influences this modulation, allowing a variety of outcomes for BK channel activity in response to acute alcohol."
https://openalex.org/W1992358610,"One of the main culprits in modern drug discovery is apparent cardiotoxicity of many lead-candidates via inadvertent pharmacologic blockade of K+, Ca2+ and Na+ currents. Many drugs inadvertently block hERG1 leading to an acquired form of the Long QT syndrome and potentially lethal polymorphic ventricular tachycardia. An emerging strategy is to rely on interventions with a drug that may proactively activate hERG1 channels reducing cardiovascular risks. Small molecules-activators have a great potential for co-therapies where the risk of hERG-related QT prolongation is significant and rehabilitation of the drug is impractical. Although a number of hERG1 activators have been identified in the last decade, their binding sites, functional moieties responsible for channel activation and thus mechanism of action, have yet to be established. Here, we present a proof-of-principle study that combines de-novo drug design, molecular modeling, chemical synthesis with whole cell electrophysiology and Action Potential (AP) recordings in fetal mouse ventricular myocytes to establish basic chemical principles required for efficient activator of hERG1 channel. In order to minimize the likelihood that these molecules would also block the hERG1 channel they were computationally engineered to minimize interactions with known intra-cavitary drug binding sites. The combination of experimental and theoretical studies led to identification of functional elements (functional groups, flexibility) underlying efficiency of hERG1 activators targeting binding pocket located in the S4–S5 linker, as well as identified potential side-effects in this promising line of drugs, which was associated with multi-channel targeting of the developed drugs."
https://openalex.org/W1976340053,"Dendritic cells (DCs) are major antigen-presenting cells that play a key role in initiating and regulating innate and adaptive immune responses. DCs are critical mediators of tolerance and immunity. The functional properties of DCs decline with age. The purpose of this study was to define the age-associated molecular changes in DCs by gene array analysis using Affymatrix GeneChips. The expression levels of a total of 260 genes (1.8%) were significantly different (144 down-regulated and 116 upregulated) in monocyte-derived DCs (MoDCs) from aged compared to young human donors. Of the 260 differentially expressed genes, 24% were down-regulated by more than 3-fold, suggesting that a large reduction in expression occurred for a notable number of genes in the aged. Our results suggest that the genes involved in immune response to pathogens, cell migration and T cell priming display significant age-related changes. Furthermore, downregulated genes involved in cell cycle arrest and DNA replication may play a critical role in aging-associated genetic instability. These changes in gene expression provide molecular based evidence for age-associated functional abnormalities in human DCs that may be responsible for the defects in adaptive immunity observed in the elderly."
https://openalex.org/W2111209807,"We have studied the differential effects of phospholamban (PLB) phosphorylation states on the activity of the sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca-ATPase (SERCA). It has been shown that unphosphorylated PLB (U-PLB) inhibits SERCA and that phosphorylation of PLB at Ser-16 or Thr-17 relieves this inhibition in cardiac sarcoplasmic reticulum. However, the levels of the four phosphorylation states of PLB (U-PLB, P16-PLB, P17-PLB, and doubly phosphorylated 2P-PLB) have not been measured quantitatively in cardiac tissue, and their functional effects on SERCA have not been determined directly. We have solved both problems through the chemical synthesis of all four PLB species. We first used the synthetic PLB as standards for a quantitative immunoblot assay, to determine the concentrations of all four PLB phosphorylation states in pig cardiac tissue, with and without left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) induced by aortic banding. In both LVH and sham hearts, all phosphorylation states were significantly populated, but LVH hearts showed a significant decrease in U-PLB, with a corresponding increase in the ratio of total phosphorylated PLB to U-PLB. To determine directly the functional effects of each PLB species, we co-reconstituted each of the synthetic peptides in phospholipid membranes with SERCA and measured calcium-dependent ATPase activity. SERCA inhibition was maximally relieved by P16-PLB (the most highly populated PLB state in cardiac tissue homogenates), followed by 2P-PLB, then P17-PLB. These results show that each PLB phosphorylation state uniquely alters Ca(2+) homeostasis, with important implications for cardiac health, disease, and therapy."
https://openalex.org/W1974258783,"Development of the mammalian face requires a large number of genes that are expressed with spatio-temporal specificity, and transcriptional regulation mediated by enhancers plays a key role in the precise control of gene expression. Using chromatin immunoprecipitation for a histone marker of active enhancers, we generated a genome-wide map of candidate enhancers from the maxillary arch (primordium for the upper jaw) of mouse embryos. Furthermore, we confirmed multiple novel craniofacial enhancers near the genes implicated in human palate defects through functional assays. We characterized in detail one of the enhancers (Lhx8_enh1) located upstream of Lhx8, a key regulatory gene for craniofacial development. Lhx8_enh1 contained an evolutionarily conserved binding site for lymphoid enhancer factor/T-cell factor family proteins, which mediate the transcriptional regulation by the WNT/β-catenin signaling pathway. We demonstrated in vitro that WNT/β-catenin signaling was indeed essential for the expression of Lhx8 in the maxillary arch cells and that Lhx8_enh1 was a direct target of the WNT/β-catenin pathway. Together, we uncovered a molecular mechanism for the regulation of Lhx8, and we provided valuable resources for further investigation into the gene regulatory network of craniofacial development."
https://openalex.org/W2050172116,"Esophageal carcinoma is one of the world's deadliest cancers. Esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) is more frequent than adenocarcenoma (AC) in China. Platinum-based chemotherapy with surgical resection is a common treatment approach for ESCC; however, the treatment response is uncertain. Evidence suggests polymorphisms in genes encoding excision repair cross-complementing group 1 (ERCC1), a protein involved in nuclear excision repair (NER), may help predict response to cisplatin and other platinum-based chemotherapeutics. Multiple ERCC1 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) have been associated with platinum chemotherapy response. Two common SNPs occur at the C8092A and C118T loci. Our study aimed to determine if 1) an association exists between ERCC1 tumor expression and patient survival, 2) whether adjuvant therapy influence on survival is related to histological ERCC1 presence in tumor cell nuclei, and 3) whether other clinicopathological characteristics in a cohort of patients following surgery for various stages of ESCC are associated with tumor ERCC1 expression. One hundred eight patients were included in the study, and tumor biopsy was collected for genotyping and immunohistochemical analysis of ERCC1. Sixty-seven patients (62%) received no adjuvant therapy, and the rest had either platinum-based chemotherapy (28.5%), radiotherapy (6.5%) or both treatments (2.8%). Log-rank analysis revealed no significant connection between tumor ERCC1 expression (P = 0.12) or adjuvant therapy (P = 0.56) on patient survival. Also, non-parametric Mann-Whitney analysis showed no significant link between tumor size or nodus tumor formation and ERCC1 presence in patients in the study. Interestingly, C8092A SNP showed significant association with patient survival (P = 0.01), with patients homozygous for the mutant allele showing the most significantly reduced survival (P = 0.04) compared to those homozygous for the dominant allele (CC). Our results provide novel insight into the genotypic variation of patients from Quanzhou, Fujian province China."
https://openalex.org/W2052531270,"Processes underlying mechanotransduction and its regulation are poorly understood. Inhibitors of Ca2+-activated K+ channels cause a dramatic increase in afferent output from stretched muscle spindles. We used immunocytochemistry to test for the presence and location of small conductance Ca2+-activated K+ channels (SK1-3) in primary endings of muscle spindles and lanceolate endings of hair follicles in the rat. Tissue sections were double immunolabelled with antibodies to one of the SK channel isoforms and to either synaptophysin (SYN, as a marker of synaptic like vesicles (SLV), present in many mechanosensitive endings) or S100 (a Ca2+-binding protein present in glial cells). SK channel immunoreactivity was also compared to immunolabelling for the Na+ ion channel ASIC2, previously reported in both spindle primary and lanceolate endings. SK1 was not detected in sensory terminals of either muscle spindles or lanceolate endings. SK2 was found in the terminals of both muscle spindles and lanceolate endings, where it colocalised with the SLV marker SYN (spindles and lanceolates) and the satellite glial cell (SGC) marker S100 (lanceolates). SK3 was not detected in muscle spindles; by contrast it was present in hair follicle endings, expressed predominantly in SGCs but perhaps also in the SGC: terminal interface, as judged by colocalisation statistical analysis of SYN and S100 immunoreactivity. The possibility that all three isoforms might be expressed in pre-terminal axons, especially at heminodes, cannot be ruled out. Differential distribution of SK channels is likely to be important in their function of responding to changes in intracellular [Ca2+] thereby modulating mechanosensory transduction by regulating the excitability of the sensory terminals. In particular, the presence of SK2 throughout the sensory terminals of both kinds of mechanoreceptor indicates an important role for an outward Ca2+-activated K+ current in the formation of the receptor potential in both types of ending."
https://openalex.org/W1992259691,"Selenocysteine (Sec), the 21(st) amino acid, is synthesized from a serine precursor in a series of reactions that require selenocysteine tRNA (tRNA(Sec)). In archaea and eukaryotes, O-phosphoseryl-tRNA(Sec):selenocysteinyl-tRNA(Sec) synthase (SepSecS) catalyzes the terminal synthetic reaction during which the phosphoseryl intermediate is converted into the selenocysteinyl moiety while being attached to tRNA(Sec). We have previously shown that only the SepSecS tetramer is capable of binding to and recognizing the distinct fold of tRNA(Sec). Because only two of the four tRNA-binding sites were occupied in the crystal form, a question was raised regarding whether the observed arrangement and architecture faithfully recapitulated the physiologically relevant ribonucleoprotein complex important for selenoprotein formation. Herein, we determined the stoichiometry of the human terminal synthetic complex of selenocysteine by using small angle x-ray scattering, multi-angle light scattering, and analytical ultracentrifugation. In addition, we provided the first estimate of the ratio between SepSecS and tRNA(Sec) in vivo. We show that SepSecS preferentially binds one or two tRNA(Sec) molecules at a time and that the enzyme is present in large molar excess over the substrate tRNA in vivo. Moreover, we show that in a complex between SepSecS and two tRNAs, one enzyme homodimer plays a role of the noncatalytic unit that positions CCA ends of two tRNA(Sec) molecules into the active site grooves of the other, catalytic, homodimer. Finally, our results demonstrate that the previously determined crystal structure represents the physiologically and catalytically relevant complex and suggest that allosteric regulation of SepSecS might play an important role in regulation of selenocysteine and selenoprotein synthesis."
https://openalex.org/W2012995256,"The agouti viable (Avy) locus is considered a model to understand how retroelements function as controlling elements in mammals. Epigenetic factors, principally CpG methylation, are widely held to play a dominant regulatory role in controlling the locus' activity. The purpose of this study was to examine its behavior in ES cells and determine if this locus could be exploited for use in screen-based investigations. We have derived multiple Avy ES cell lines from the C57BL/6 strain and generated a cell line carrying a GFP-reporter gene (Avy/AGFP). Use of the DNA demethylating drug 5-azacitidine on various ES cell lines does not induce either agouti or GFP expression. Methylation analysis reveals that although most lines display normal methylation at IAP elements in general, the Avy IAP element is essentially unmethylated. In addition, we find that different repeat compartments are epigenetically unstable in a number of derived cell lines."
