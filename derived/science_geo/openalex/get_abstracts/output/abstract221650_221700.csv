https://openalex.org/W2093057648,"Pentose phosphate pathway and isocitrate dehydrogenase are generally considered to be the major sources of the anabolic reductant NADPH. As one of very few microbes, Escherichia coli contains two transhydrogenase isoforms with unknown physiological function that could potentially transfer electrons directly from NADH to NADP+ and vice versa. Using defined mutants and metabolic flux analysis, we identified the proton-translocating transhydrogenase PntAB as a major source of NADPH in E. coli. During standard aerobic batch growth on glucose, 35–45% of the NADPH that is required for biosynthesis was produced via PntAB, whereas pentose phosphate pathway and isocitrate dehydrogenase contributed 35–45% and 20–25%, respectively. The energy-independent transhydrogenase UdhA, in contrast, was essential for growth under metabolic conditions with excess NADPH formation, i.e. growth on acetate or in a phosphoglucose isomerase mutant that catabolized glucose through the pentose phosphate pathway. Thus, both isoforms have divergent physiological functions: energy-dependent reduction of NADP+ with NADH by PntAB and reoxidation of NADPH by UdhA. Expression appeared to be modulated by the redox state of cellular metabolism, because genetic and environmental manipulations that increased or decreased NADPH formation down-regulated pntA or udhA transcription, respectively. The two transhydrogenase isoforms provide E. coli primary metabolism with an extraordinary flexibility to cope with varying catabolic and anabolic demands, which raises two general questions: why do only a few bacteria contain both isoforms, and how do other organisms manage NADPH metabolism? Pentose phosphate pathway and isocitrate dehydrogenase are generally considered to be the major sources of the anabolic reductant NADPH. As one of very few microbes, Escherichia coli contains two transhydrogenase isoforms with unknown physiological function that could potentially transfer electrons directly from NADH to NADP+ and vice versa.

The two transhydrogenase isoforms provide E. coli primary metabolism with an extraordinary flexibility to cope with varying catabolic and anabolic demands, which raises two general questions: why do only a few bacteria contain both isoforms, and how do other organisms manage NADPH metabolism? About 1,000 anabolic reactions synthesize the macromolecular components that make up functional cells (1Edwards J.S. Palsson B.O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 5528-5533Crossref PubMed Scopus (746) Google Scholar, 2Förster J. Famili I. Fu P. Palsson B.O. Nielsen J. Genome Res. 2003; 13: 244-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (867) Google Scholar), but only 11 intermediates of central carbon metabolism and the cofactors ATP, NADH, and NADPH constitute the core of this intricate biochemical network (3Neidhardt F.C. Ingraham J.L. Schaechter M. Physiology of the Bacterial Cell: a Molecular Approach. Sinauer Associates, Inc., Sunderland, Mass1990Google Scholar, 4Gottschalk G. Bacterial Metabolism. Springer-Verlag, New York, NY1986Crossref Google Scholar). These intermediates and cofactors must be supplied through the catabolism of different substrates at appropriate rates and stoichiometries for balanced growth; hence, anabolism and catabolism are delicately balanced and regulated to enable growth under fluctuating environmental conditions. Although chemically very similar, the redox cofactors NADH and NADPH serve distinct biochemical functions and participate in more than 100 enzymatic reactions (5Ouzonis C.A. Karp P.D. Genome Res. 2000; 10: 568-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The electrons of the main respiratory cofactor NADH are transferred primarily to oxygen, thereby driving oxidative phosphorylation of ADP to ATP (3Neidhardt F.C. Ingraham J.L. Schaechter M.

Springer-Verlag, New York, NY1986Crossref Google Scholar, 6Russell J.B. Cook G.M. Microbiol. Rev. 1995; 59: 48-62Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). NADPH, in contrast, exclusively drives anabolic reduction reactions. Despite the important role in linking the fundamental processes of catabolism and anabolism, however, even a qualitative understanding of NADPH metabolism is still missing for most organisms. The primary NADPH-generating reactions are considered to be the oxidative pentose phosphate (PP) 1The abbreviations used are: PP pathway, pentose phosphate pathway; TCA cycle, tricarboxylic acid cycle; GC-MS, gas chromatography-mass spectrometry; ED pathway, Entner-Doudoroff pathway; PEP, phosphoenolpyruvate; Pgi, phosphoglucose isomerase; UdhA, energy-independent, soluble transhydrogenase; PntAB, energy-dependent, membrane-bound transhydrogenase; Zwf, glucose-6P dehydrogenase. pathway and the NADPH-dependent isocitrate dehydrogenase in the TCA cycle (Fig. 1; Refs. 4Gottschalk G.

Additionally, nicotinamide nucleotide transhydrogenases may be involved, but ever since their discovery, their physiological role has been a source of speculation and often a matter of controversy (9Hoek J.B. Rydström J. Biochem. J. 1988; 254: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar, 10Harold F. The Vital Force: A Study of Bioenergetics.

The transhydrogenase reaction [NADPH] + [NAD+] + [H+in] 〈-〉 [NADP+] + [NADH] + [H+out] may be catalyzed by either a membrane-bound, proton-translocating or a soluble, energy-independent isoform (9Hoek J.B. Rydström J. Biochem. J. 1988; 254: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar, 12Bizouarn T. Althage M. Pedersen A. Tigerstrom A. Karlsson J. Johansson C. Rydström J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1555: 122-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Microbes often contain one isoform or none, with the Enterobacteriaceae as the only known exception that contain both isoforms encoded by the pntAB (13Clarke D.M. Loo T.W. Gillam S. Bragg P.D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1986; 158: 647-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) and udhA (14Boonstra B. French C.E. Wainwright I. Bruce N.C. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 1030-1034Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) genes, respectively. In eukaryotes, the proton-translocating transhydrogenase seems to have a flexible function as a buffer against dissipation of either the mitochondrial redox potential or energy supply (9Hoek J.B. Rydström J. Biochem. J. 1988; 254: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). In prokaryotes, however, the physiological role of the two isoforms remains an exciting matter of debate, and several potential functions were put forward (8Csonka L.N. Fraenkel D.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 3382-3391Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Hoek J.B. Rydström J. Biochem. J. 1988; 254: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar, 15Voordouw G. van der Vies S.M.

Based on the isoform distribution in different organisms and the generally more reduced state of the NADP(H) pool compared with the NAD(H) pool (10Harold F. The Vital Force: A Study of Bioenergetics. Freeman and Company, New York, NY1986Google Scholar), it has been hypothesized (15Voordouw G. van der Vies S.M. Themmen A.P.N. Eur. J. Biochem. 1983; 131: 527-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) that the physiological function of membrane-bound and soluble transhydrogenases in microbes might be generation and reoxidation of NADPH, respectively. Indeed, organisms lacking transhydrogenases, such as the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, cannot tolerate imbalances between catabolic NADPH production and anabolic NADPH consumption (18Boles E. Lehnert W. Zimmermann F.K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 217: 469-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 19Nissen T.L. Anderlund M. Nielsen J. Villadsen J. Kielland-Brandt M.C. Yeast. 2001; 18: 19-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), unless a soluble isoform is expressed (19Nissen T.L. Anderlund M. Nielsen J. Villadsen J. Kielland-Brandt M.C. Yeast. 2001; 18: 19-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 20Fiaux J. Çakar Z.P. Sonderegger M. Wüthrich K. Szyperski T. Sauer U. Euk. Cell. 2003; 2: 170-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Further means of NADPH reoxidation must exist, however, because isotopic tracer-based carbon flux analysis revealed that at least some bacteria without transhydrogenase homologues exhibit a similar uncoupling (21Wittmann C. Heinzle E. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2002; 68: 5843-5859Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 22Dauner M. Bailey J.E. Sauer U. Biotechnol.

Biotechnol. 2003; 104: 185-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). In Escherichia coli, overexpression of the soluble transhydrogenase UdhA was shown to partially restore the growth phenotype of a phosphoglucose isomerase mutant with impaired NADPH metabolism (26Canonaco F. Hess T.A. Heri S. Wang T. Szyperski T. Sauer U. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 2001; 204: 247-252Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), but its physiological role in wild-type E. coli remains obscure. Whether or not the membrane-bound isoform actually contributes to the formation of NADPH in E. coli is unclear at present, but isotopic tracer experiments indicated that it is not an important source of NADPH during growth on glucose (8Csonka L.N. Fraenkel D.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 3382-3391Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 27Emmerling M. Dauner M. Ponti A. Fiaux J. Hochuli M. Szyperski T. Wüthrich K. Bailey J.E. Sauer U. J.

Gosset G. Flores N. de Graaf A.A. Bolivar F. Metabolic Eng. 2002; 4: 124-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Here we elucidate the physiological roles of the two transhydrogenase isoforms in E. coli. More generally, we attempt to quantify the extent to which catabolism is coupled to anabolism via NADPH. The experimental strategy was to perturb NADPH metabolism with defined mutations and system response monitoring using metabolic flux analysis based on 13C-labeling experiments. This approach is at present the exclusive methodology for the quantification of NADPH formation in metabolic networks (27Emmerling M. Dauner M. Ponti A. Fiaux J. Hochuli M. Szyperski T. Wüthrich K.

Strains and Growth Conditions—Wild-type E. coli MG1655 and mutants derived thereof were used in all physiological experiments (Table I). All physiological experiments were conducted in M9 minimal medium (33Emmerling M. Bailey J.E. Sauer U. Metabolic Eng. 1999; 1: 117-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), supplemented with 5.0 g/liter of either glucose, acetate, glycerol, or gluconate as the sole carbon source. Unless indicated otherwise, batch cultures were grown in 500-ml baffled shake flasks with maximally 50 ml of medium at 37 °C on a gyratory shaker at 200 rpm. Where necessary, 50 mg/liter ampicillin, 50 mg/liter kanamycin, or 25 mg/liter chloramphenicol were added.Table IConstructed E. coli mutants and their maximum specific growth rate during exponential growth on glucoseStrainKnown genetic markersaCorrect deletion was verified by PCR with genomic DNA and by in vitro enzyme assays.

After inoculation with maximally 1% (v/v) of an M9 preculture and strictly exponential growth at the maximum rate up to an optical density at 600 nm (A600) of 1.0–1.5, culture aliquots were harvested, centrifuged at 2,500 × g and 4 °C for 8 min, washed with 10 mm MgSO4 and 9 g/liter NaCl, and stored at -20 °C. Genetic Methods—All recombinant DNA techniques followed standard protocols (34Sambrook J. Russell D.W. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, 3rd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2001Google Scholar). For colony PCR, part of a colony from a LB plate was dissolved into 50 μlofddH2O and incubated at 99 °C for 10 min. 0.5–2.0 μl of the lysate were then used as the template for PCR. Knockout mutants were generated by marker-free deletion of genes from start to stop codon (35Datsenko K.A. Wanner B.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 6640-6645Crossref PubMed Scopus (11304) Google Scholar). Briefly, PCR-fragments of the Flp recognition target-flanked kanamycin gene from plasmid pKD13 were amplified with primers that contained sequence extension that match the flanking regions of target genes or operons. Correct plasmid integration and excision were verified in all mutants by colony PCR. Total RNA for semi-quantitative RT-PCR was purified from 1-ml aliquots of batch cultures with an A600 of about unity using the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen). The RNA solution was frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -70 °C for further use. RNA quantification and purity were controlled in agarose gels with formaldehyde (34Sambrook J. Russell D.W. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, 3rd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2001Google Scholar). For RT-PCR, we used the OneStep RT-PCR kit (Qiagen) with 100 ng of total RNA and 0.6 μm of gene-specific primers. Reverse transcription was allowed to proceed for 30 min at 50 °C, and the cDNA was then amplified by cycles of 30 s at 94 °C, 30 s at 55 °C, and 1 min/kb at 72 °C, using the following primers: for udhA 5′-AAAATGTTGGCGGCGGTTGC-3′ and 5′-CATCGTCGGGTAGTTAAAGGTGGTGTT-3′; for pntA, 5′-CCAAGAGAACGGTTAACCAATGAAA-3′ and 5′-ATAAGCACCGCGATAAAACTAAGGAA-3′; for the rpoD gene that encodes the RNA polymerase subunit σ70, 5′-GATCAACGACATGGGCATTCAGGTG-3′ and 5′-CTTCTTCCAGCGTGTAGTCGGTGTTCATA-3′. To identify the exponential amplification phase, 10, 15, 20, 25, and 30 amplification cycles were tested. Because 20 cycles gave the best tradeoff between PCR-product yield and quantification, all other RT-PCR experiments were done with 20 cycles. Total RNA samples were routinely tested for the absence of chromosomal DNA contaminations by using control primers that hybridize outside the open reading frame. Aliquots were analyzed on agarose gels, quantified by visual inspection, and the results were normalized to the amplification product obtained with rpoD-specific primers as an internal standard. Metabolic Flux Ratio Analysis by GC-MS—Direct analytical interpretation of GC-MS-derived 13C-labeling pattern in proteinogenic amino acids was used to quantify independent flux partitioning ratios (36Fischer E. Sauer U. Eur. J. Biochem. 2003; 270: 880-891Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar, 37Fischer E. Sauer U. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 46446-46451Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Biomass pellets harvested from 13C-labeling experiments were resuspended and hydrolyzed in 1.5 ml of 6 m HCl at 105 °C for 24 h in sealed 2.2-ml Eppendorf tubes. After drying in a vacuum centrifuge at room temperature, hydrolysates were derivatized at 85 °C in 50 μl of dimethylformamide (Fluka) and 50 μl of N-(tert-butyldimethylsilyl)-N-methyl-trifluoroacetamide (Fluka) for 60 min. The mass isotope distribution in the derivatized amino acids was then analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS), and the GC-MS-derived mass distributions of proteinogenic amino acids were corrected for naturally occurring isotopes (36Fischer E. Sauer U. Eur. J. Biochem. 2003; 270: 880-891Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). The corrected mass distributions were related to in vivo metabolic activities using algebraic equations and statistical data treatment which quantified 14 ratios of fluxes through converging reactions and pathways to the synthesis of eight intracellular metabolites from [1-13C]glucose and [U-13C]glucose experiments (36Fischer E. Sauer U. Eur. J. Biochem. 2003; 270: 880-891Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). Metabolic Net Flux Analysis—Intracellular net carbon fluxes were estimated from the physiological data with a stoichiometric matrix containing 24 intracellular fluxes, 3 extracellular fluxes, and 22 metabolite balances (partly shown in Fig. 1). Fluxes into biomass were calculated from the known metabolite requirements for macromolecular compounds (3Neidhardt F.C. Ingraham J.L. Schaechter M. Physiology of the Bacterial Cell: a Molecular Approach. Sinauer Associates, Inc., Sunderland, Mass1990Google Scholar) and the growth rate-dependent RNA and protein content of E. coli (27Emmerling M. Dauner M. Ponti A. Fiaux J. Hochuli M. Szyperski T. Wüthrich K. Bailey J.E. Sauer U. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 152-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar, 38Pramanik J. Keasling J.D. Biotechnol. Bioeng. 1997; 56: 398-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). The system of linear equations was solved uniquely with constraints obtained from six of the above calculated flux ratios (i.e. serine through glycolysis, pyruvate through Entner-Doudoroff pathway (ED pathway), oxaloacetate from phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP), PEP from oxaloacetate, pyruvate from malate, and PEP through PP pathway) that were formulated as linearly independent equations as described previously (23Sauer U. Hatzimanikatis V. Bailey J.E. Hochuli M. Szyperski T. Wüthrich K. Nature Biotechnol. 1997; 15: 448-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar, 39Fischer E. Zamboni N. Sauer U. Anal. Biochem. 2004; 10.1016/j.ab.2003.10.036PubMed Google Scholar, 40Zamboni N. Sauer U. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 2003; 226: 121-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Briefly, the sum of the weighed square residuals of the constraints from both metabolite balances and flux ratios was minimized by using the MATLAB function fmincon, and the residuals were weighed by dividing through the experimental error (39Fischer E. Zamboni N. Sauer U. Anal. Biochem. 2004; 10.1016/j.ab.2003.10.036PubMed Google Scholar). The computation was repeated at least five times with randomly chosen initial flux distributions to ensure identification of the global minimum. Determination of Physiological Parameters—Glucose, acetate, and protein concentrations were determined enzymatically using commercial kits. The exponential growth phase was identified by log-linear regression of the optical density at 600 nm (A600) versus time, with maximal growth rate (μmax) as the regression coefficient. To obtain specific production rates, A600 values were converted to cellular dry weight using a predetermined correlation factor of 0.51 g/liter cellular dry weight per A600 unit. The specific substrate uptake and product formation rates were calculated by log-linear regression of substrate/product versus biomass concentration, dividing the regression coefficient by the maximal growth rate. Errors are calculated as standard deviations or as average error of the mean, in which case the error was calculated as for a general function f(x,y). In Vitro Enzyme Activities—Crude cell extracts were prepared from M9 batch cultures that were harvested at A600 of around unity. Cell pellets were washed once with 9 g/liter NaCl and 10 mm MgSO4 and disrupted by sonication at 100 W on ice for 2 min. Phosphoglucose isomerase and ED pathway activities were determined in supernatants of crude cell extracts after centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 30 min as described previously (41Fraenkel D.G. Levisohn S.R. J. Bacteriol. 1967; 93: 1571-1578Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Because one isoform is membrane-bound, transhydrogenase activity was determined in cell extracts without centrifugation (42Park S.M. Sinskey A.J. Stephanopoulos G. Biotechnol. Bioeng. 1997; 55: 864-879Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Briefly, the change in absorbance at 375 nm was monitored at 25 °C in a mixture containing 50 mm Tris·HCl (pH 7.6), 2 mm MgCl2, 500 μm NADPH, 1 mm 3-acetylpyridine adenine dinucleotide, and 10–100 μl crude cell extract. The specific activity was then obtained by dividing the measured slope by the protein concentration. Physiological and Biochemical Characterization of Transhydrogenase Mutants—To elucidate the function of the soluble and the membrane-bound transhydrogenase, marker-free deletion mutants of the udhA and pntAB genes were constructed in E. coli wild-type MG1655. The mutants grew without any apparent phenotype on LB medium, and successful deletion was verified by the absence of the corresponding mRNA in the mutants with RT-PCR. As expected, in vitro reduction of NAD+ from NADPH was abolished in cell extracts obtained from the UdhA-PntAB double mutant during growth on glucose, but some activity was retained in the UdhA and PntAB mutants (Fig. 2). Thus, both isoforms appear to be present during growth on glucose, with the membrane-bound transhydrogenase PntAB as the major one. The isoenzyme proportion of PntAB may be even higher because activities of soluble proteins are typically better determined with in vitro assays than the activities of membrane-bound enzymes. The maximum growth rate of the UdhA mutant on glucose was indistinguishable from that of the parent, but was significantly reduced for the PntAB and UdhA-PntAB mutants (Table I). To elucidate the intracellular carbon flux response, we used metabolic flux ratio analysis by GC-MS (36Fischer E. Sauer U. Eur. J. Biochem. 2003; 270: 880-891Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). By comparing 13C-labeling pattern in proteinogenic amino acids, this strictly local analysis quantifies ratios of converging fluxes at the junction of two or more pathways or reactions (43Sauer U. Lasko D.R. Fiaux J. Hochuli M. Glaser R. Szyperski T. Wüthrich K. Bailey J.E. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 6679-6688Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 44Szyperski T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 232: 433-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). Different from global data fitting in the net flux analysis described below, this approach yields ratios of fluxes that are independent of each other (23Sauer U. Hatzimanikatis V. Bailey J.E. Hochuli M. Szyperski T. Wüthrich K. Nature Biotechnol. 1997; 15: 448-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar, 27Emmerling M. Dauner M. Ponti A. Fiaux J. Hochuli M. Szyperski T. Wüthrich K.

Bioeng. 2003; 84: 129-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). In separate batch cultures that were grown either on 100% [1-13C]glucose or on a mixture of 20% [U-13C]glucose and 80% unlabeled glucose, the overall flux profiles were very similar in the UdhA mutant and the wild type (Fig. 3). Deletion of the membrane-bound transhydrogenase in the PntAB and UdhA-PntAB mutants, in contrast, resulted in a significantly higher fraction of PEP generated through the PP pathway and a concomitantly lower fraction of 3P-glycerate generated through glycolysis. This provides strong evidence for a flux rerouting from glycolysis to the NADPH-producing PP pathway. The PntAB mutant secreted several metabolites, which may explain its unusually high fraction of oxaloacetate molecules originating from PEP that indicates high anaplerotic PEP carboxylase and low respiratory TCA cycle activity. NADPH Metabolism in Transhydrogenase Mutants—Metabolism-wide NADPH production and consumption in the mutants was then assessed by quantifying absolute intracellular carbon fluxes from the extracellular fluxes in and out of the cells, based on quantitative physiological data and the flux ratios of Fig. 3 (39Fischer E.

In contrast to previous isotopomer-based net flux analysis in E. coli (27Emmerling M. Dauner M. Ponti A. Fiaux J. Hochuli M. Szyperski T. Wüthrich K. Bailey J.E. Sauer U. J.

Biotechnol. 2003; 101: 101-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar), we have sufficient data from separate [1-13C]glucose and [U-13C]glucose experiments to resolve the fluxes through both the ED pathway and the glyoxylate shunt. For wild-type E. coli, the molar flux estimates revealed that about 25% of glucose catabolism proceeds by means of the PP pathway and about 2% by means of the ED pathway (Fig. 4). Only a relatively small fraction of the consumed glucose was oxidized to CO2 within the TCA cycle, as was described previously for batch cultures of the same strain using a comprehensive isotopomer model (37Fischer E. Sauer U. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 46446-46451Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Consistent with the flux ratios (Fig. 3), the absolute in vivo fluxes were very similar in wild-type and UdhA mutant (data not shown). The PntAB and UdhA-PntAB mutants, however, channeled significantly more carbon flux through the oxidative PP pathway (Fig. 4). The in vivo production rate of NADPH was then estimated by summing up carbon fluxes through the NADPH-producing catabolic reactions (Fig. 5). Because the two isoforms of malic enzyme exhibit diffe"

Here we present the first detailed analysis of the distribution and expression of cytoglobin. Northern and Western blotting experiments show the presence of cytoglobin mRNA and protein in a broad range of tissues. Quantitative PCR demonstrates an up-regulation of cytoglobin mRNA levels in rat heart and liver under hypoxic conditions (22 and 44 h of 9% oxygen). Immunofluorescence studies with three antibodies directed against different epitopes of the protein consistently show cytoglobin in connective tissue fibroblasts as well as in hepatic stellate cells. Cytoglobin is also present in chondroblasts and osteoblasts and shows a decreased level of expression upon differentiation to chondrocytes and osteocytes. Cytoglobin is located in the cytoplasm of these cell types. Evidence against an exclusively nuclear localization of cytoglobin, as recently proposed, is also provided by transfection assays with green fluorescent protein fusion constructs, which demonstrates the absence of an active nuclear import. The differential expression of cytoglobin argues against a general respiratory function of this molecule, but rather indicates a connective tissue-specific function. We hypothesize that cytoglobin may be involved in collagen synthesis. Cytoglobin expression was also observed in some neuronal subpopulations of the central and the peripheral nervous systems. Surprisingly, cytoglobin is localized in both the cytoplasm and nucleus of neurons, indicating a possible additional role of this protein in neuronal tissues.

Globins are small heme-containing proteins that have the ability to bind O2 and other gaseous ligands (1Dickerson R.E. Geis I. Hemoglobin: Structure, Function, Evolution, and Pathology. Benjamin/Cummings, Menlo Park, CA1983Google Scholar). Most globins efficiently capture and deliver O2, thus sustaining the aerobic metabolism of the respiratory chain (2Hardison R.C. Proc. Natl.

Some globins may also act as enzymes utilizing molecular O2 in oxidation reactions (7Minning D.M. Gow A.J. Bonaventura J. Braun R. Dewhirst M. Goldberg D.E. Stamler J.S.

The heterotetrameric hemoglobin facilitates the transport of O2 in the red blood cells of the circulatory system (1Dickerson R.E. Geis I. Hemoglobin: Structure, Function, Evolution, and Pathology. Benjamin/Cummings, Menlo Park, CA1983Google Scholar). The myocytes of the cardiac and striated muscles contain myoglobin, a monomeric protein that enhances O2 diffusion to the mitochondria of this metabolically highly active tissue and acts as a temporal O2 store (4Merx M.W.

Myoglobin may also act as an NO dioxygenase (8Flögel U. Merx M.W. Gödecke A. Decking U.K. Schrader J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 735-740Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar). A respiratory function has also been attributed to neuroglobin (Ngb), 1The abbreviations used are: Ngb, neuroglobin; Cygb, cytoglobin; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; GFP, green fluorescent protein; HSCs, hepatic stellate cells; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; ROS, reactive oxygen species; RT, reverse transcription; EST, expressed sequence tag. a recently described vertebrate monomeric globin (9Burmester T.

Neuroscience. 2002; 115: 645-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar), and a particularly high Ngb concentration was observed in the mammalian retina (12Schmidt M. Gieβl A. Laufs T. Hankeln T. Wolfrum U. Burmester T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 1932-1935Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). Most recently, cytoglobin (Cygb) has been identified as the fourth member of the vertebrate globin family. Cygb has been identified in the expressed sequence tag (EST) databases from mouse, man, and zebrafish and was found to be expressed in a broad range of mammalian tissues (13Burmester T. Ebner B.

Trent III, J.T. Hargrove M.S. Biophys. J. 2003; 84: 3931-3940Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), recombinant Cygb displays a hexacoordinated hemochrome structure of the Fe2+ in the deoxy form (14Trent III, J.T.

Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 51713-51721Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). Mammalian Cygb has the highest degree of sequence conservation observed among the vertebrate globins, with mouse and human Cygb differing in only 4.7% of the amino acids (13Burmester T. Ebner B. Weich B. Hankeln T. Mol. Biol. Evol. 2002; 19: 416-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar). Phylogenetic analyses suggest that Cygb and myoglobin form a common clade, which is distinct from neuroglobin and hemoglobin and originated from a globin common ancestor more than 450 million years ago (13Burmester T. Ebner B. Weich B. Hankeln T. Mol. Biol. Evol. 2002; 19: 416-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar, 20Pesce A. Bolognesi M. Ascenzi P. Bocedi A. Dewilde S. Moens L. Hankeln T. Burmester T. EMBO Rep. 2002; 3: 1146-1151Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). Mammalian Cygb is longer than most globins and covers 190 amino acids instead of the typical 140-150 amino acids. This is due to two ∼20 amino acid extensions at both the N and the C terminus. Nevertheless, the globin fold consisting of eight α-helices, and important globin-specific residues involved in O2 binding are conserved in the Cygb protein (20Pesce A. Bolognesi M. Ascenzi P. Bocedi A. Dewilde S. Moens L. Hankeln T. Burmester T. EMBO Rep. 2002; 3: 1146-1151Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar, 21de Sanctis D. Dewilde S. Pesce A. Ascenzi P. Burmester T. Hankeln T. Moens L. Bolognesi M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 2003; 59: 1285-1287Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). In addition to the globin-typical introns at positions B12.2 (i.e. between codon positions 2 and 3 of the 12th amino acid of the B-helix) and G7.0, the mammalian Cygb genes contain an intron downstream of the H helix (HC11.2), close to the 3′-end of the coding region. This 3′ exon is absent in fish and may have been acquired later in tetrapod evolution (13Burmester T. Ebner B. Weich B. Hankeln T. Mol. Biol. Evol. 2002; 19: 416-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar). The role of Cygb in the vertebrate metabolism is essentially unknown, although several putative functions have been proposed (13Burmester T. Ebner B. Weich B. Hankeln T. Mol. Biol. Evol. 2002; 19: 416-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar, 14Trent III, J.T. Hargrove M.S. J. Biol.

Chem. 2003; 278: 30417-30420Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Similar to myoglobin in the muscle, Cygb may facilitate O2 diffusion to the mitochondria. Cygb may also act as a regulatory protein that senses changes in O2 concentration, protects cells from reactive oxygen species, or, like some other globins, carries out enzymatic functions such as NADH oxidase, NO dioxygenase, or catalase (20Pesce A. Bolognesi M. Ascenzi P. Bocedi A. Dewilde S. Moens L. Hankeln T. Burmester T. EMBO Rep. 2002; 3: 1146-1151Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). In view of these speculations, the understanding of Cygb function requires a detailed knowledge of its localization in different organs and cells. However, the available data are conflicting in terms of cellular and subcellular Cygb distribution (15Kawada N. Kristensen D.B. Asahina K. Nakatani K. Minamiyama Y. Seki S. Yoshizato K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 25318-25323Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar, 16Asahina K. Kawada N. Kristensen D.B. Nakatani K. Seki S. Shiokawa M. Tateno C. Obara M. Yoshizato K.

Chem. 2003; 278: 30417-30420Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). We therefore conducted a detailed study on Cygb localization and its regulation by hypoxia. Animals—Adult mice (Balb/C) used in this study were maintained under constant conditions (light:dark cycle 12:12 h, room temperature 21 ± 1 °C) with food and water ad libitum. Animal handling and experiments were conducted according to a protocol that was approved by the county government office (Bezirksregierung Rheinhessen-Pfalz, Az 177-07/961-30). The mice were anesthetized with tribromoethanol (0.3 g/kg body weight) and were transcardially perfused with 100 ml of 0.1 m phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) at room temperature, with 15,000 IU of heparin/liter added. Perfusion-fixation was carried out at a constant rate of 10 ml/min with 200-300 ml of ice-cold 4% paraformaldehyde, 1.37% l-lysine, 0.21% sodium periodate in PBS (23McLean I.W. Nakane P.K. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1974; 22: 1077-1083Crossref PubMed Scopus (3198) Google Scholar). The right atrium was opened to enable venous outflow. Selected tissues and organs were immediately removed, postfixed for 1 h in the same fixative, and stored at 4 °C in phosphate-buffered 30% sucrose. Bones were decalcified in 12.5% EDTA (Mallinckrodt, Hennef, Germany) in distilled water (pH 7.2-7.4) for several days at room temperature with gentle agitation. White rats (Rattus norvegicus) with a weight of ∼150 g were kept in individual cages under controlled temperature conditions of 22-24 °C. Hypoxia was achieved by incubating the rats for 22 or 44 h in a sealed chamber (70/70/50 cm), which was constantly flushed at 3.5 liters/min with a premixed gas containing 9% oxygen. The rats were killed by intramuscular injection of Imalgene 100 (100 mg/kg of body weight; Rhone-Merieux, France). Heart and liver tissues were immediately taken and frozen in liquid nitrogen. Antibody Preparation—Polyclonal antibodies were raised in rabbits against synthetic peptides that had been designed according to conserved regions of human and mouse Cygb (Fig. 1A). The antibodies are directed against the amino acid positions 2-16 of the N terminus (αCygb1: H2N-EKVPGEMEIERRERS-CONH2), 66-80 (αCygb2: H2N-MEDPLEMERSPQLRK-CONH2), or 92-106 (αCygb3: H2N-VVENL-HDPDKVSSVL-CONH2) of the middle region, or 175-190 of the C terminus (αCygb4: H2N-PNATTPPATLPSSGP-CONH2). Each of the antibodies was purified from the serum using the appropriate synthetic peptide coupled to a SulfoLink column (Pierce), following the manufacturer's instructions, and stored at 4 °C in 50 mm Tris, 100 mm glycine, pH ∼7.4, supplemented with 0.1% NaN3. ELISA (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay)—ELISA plates were coated by 2 h of incubation with 50 ng of Cygb in PBS. The plates were blocked for 1 h with 1% bovine serum albumin in PBS and subsequently washed three times with PBST (PBS supplemented with 0.05% Tween 20). Antibody incubation was carried out overnight at 4 °C. The plates were washed three times with PBST, and incubated for 90 min at 37 °C with a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibody (Dianova), diluted 1:10,000 in PBS. After additional washings, the bound antibody was quantified by staining in 1 mg/ml o-phenylenediamine dissolved in phosphate-citrate buffer, pH 5.0, 0.05% H2O2. After 30 min, the reaction was stopped by addition of 25 μlof4.5 m H2SO4 per well, and the absorption was read at 492 nm. Western Blotting—Selected tissues were homogenized in PBS and supplemented with an equal volume of sample buffer (65 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 1% SDS, 5% β-mercaptoethanol, 10% glycerol). After heat denaturation at 95 °C for 5 min, the protein samples (50 μg of total protein) were loaded to a 14% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Antibody detection was carried out on protein samples transferred to nitrocellulose for 2 h at 0.8 mA/cm2. Nonspecific binding sites were blocked by incubation for 2 h with 2% nonfat dry milk in TBST (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 140 mm NaCl, 0.3% Tween-20). The membranes were incubated overnight with anti-Cygb antibodies, diluted 1:1000 in 2% milk/TBST. The membranes were washed four times for 10 min in TBST and incubated with the goat anti-rabbit antibody coupled with alkaline phosphatase (Dianova) (1:10,000 in TBST). The filters were washed in TBST as above, and detection was carried out with nitroblue-tetrazolium and 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-phosphate as substrates. Immunohistochemistry—Cryosections (14-μm thick) of perfusion-fixed organs were placed on glass slides coated with gelatin or poly-l-lysine. Nonspecific binding sides were blocked at room temperature for 1 h with 1% bovine serum albumin in PBS. The sections were incubated with anti-Cygb antibodies (1:500 to 1:1000 in PBS) in the blocking solution overnight at 4 °C. The sections were washed 3 × 8 min in PBS and incubated for 90 min at room temperature in the dark with the secondary antibody (goat anti-rabbit IgG coupled to Cy3, Dianova), diluted 1:100 in blocking solution. The sections were washed as described above and embedded in Elvanol polyvinyl alcohol (Mowiol, Calbiochem). In some experiments, the Hoechst dye 33342 (Hoechst, Warrington, PA) was added to the Elvanol to stain the nuclei. The sections were analyzed using an Olympus BX51 research microscope equipped with a digital camera. Images were combined using the Adobe Photoshop 7.0 program, which was also used to adjust image contrast and brightness and to add labels. Northern Blotting—A commercial Northern blot (Biocat, Heidelberg, Germany) containing normalized amounts of human mRNA was hybridized under standard conditions with a human Cygb cDNA probe, labeled radioactively by random-priming (Roche Applied Science, Mannheim, Germany). Final washing conditions were 65 °C at 0.1× standard saline citrate (SSC). The blot filter was exposed for 24 h using an intensifying screen and Kodak XROmat film. Transfection of Cygb-GFP Fusion Constructs—For construction of fusions between Cygb and the green fluorescent protein (GFP) gene, the complete human Cygb coding region was first PCR-amplified using primers with restriction enzyme recognition sites attached to their 5′-ends (XhoI and KpnI for the N-terminal Cygb-GFP constructs and XhoI and XbaI for the C-terminal GFP-Cygb constructs). The PCR amplificates were then cut with the appropriate enzymes (New England Biolabs, Frankfurt/M, Germany) and directionally ligated into double-restricted pEGFP-N1 and pEGFP-C1 vectors (Clontech, Heidelberg, Germany), which contain the gene for enhanced green fluorescent protein. We constructed four different gene fusions: CyGB-EGFP-N1 and CyGB-EGFP-C1, in which the gene sequences are directly adjacent to each other, and two constructs containing an additional 6-amino acid spacer (AGC ACC TGG AGC TGC ACC) inserted between the two genes (CyGB-EGFP-N1+spacer and CyGB-EGFP-C1 +spacer) to possibly facilitate an easier folding of the smaller globin protein part. All CyGB-EGFP fusion vectors were transformed into Escherichia coli RR1 ΔM15 and verified by DNA sequencing. Plasmid DNA purified using the E.Z.N.A. Plasmid Miniprep Kit I (Peqlab, Erlangen, Germany) was of sufficient quality for successful transfection. Vero cells (ATCC CCL81) and Hela cells (ATCC CCL2) were routinely cultured in MEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 IU of penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin at 37 °C in a humidified 5% CO2 incubator. The day prior to transfection cells were plated into 35-mm glass-bottomed dishes (MatTek Corp.) at a density of 20%. On the day of transfection, 1 μg of each DNA was used with 3 μl of FuGENE6 (Roche Applied Science, Mannheim) to transfect the cells according to the manufacturer's instruction. GFP fluorescence was detected and analyzed at the Advanced Light Microscopy Facility at EMBL, Heidelberg. Cells were imaged 18 h after transfection in carbonate-free culture medium equilibrated with 10 mm HEPES pH 7.4 (24Shima D.T. Scales S.J. Kreis T.E. Pepperkok R. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 821-824Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) on a Leica DM/IRBE microscope with a ×63 NA 1.4PL Apo objective. Confocal images were taken using an UltraView real-time confocal system (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) consisting of a Nikon Eclipse TE200 microscope equipped with a 1.3 NA PlanFluar ×100 objective. Images were processed using NIH ImageJ software (Bethesda, MD). RNA Isolation and Real-time RT-PCR—Total RNA from rat was isolated using the “tri-reagent” kit (Molecular Research Center, Cincinnati, OH), and concentrations were measured using an Amersham Biosciences GeneQuant photometer. The 22-h hypoxic and the normoxic RNA samples represented a pool of four animals each. The 44-h hypoxic sample was a pool of two animals. The RT-PCR experiment was performed twice, with internal duplicate or triplicate reactions (see below). For reverse transcription (RT) we used Superscript II RNase H- reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen, Karlsruhe, Germany) and an oligo(dT15) primer. We adjusted the amount of total RNA to exactly 1 μg per 20 μl of RT reaction. Cygb expression was investigated by a TaqMan assay using primers and a MGB (Minor Groove Binder; Applied Biosystems, Darmstadt, Germany) probe designed by the Primer Express Software (Applied Biosystems, Darmstadt, Germany). The primers we used were QPCR-Cygb-For: 5′-CCA ACT GCG AGG ACG TGG-3′ and QPCR-Cygb-Rev: 5′-ACT GGC TGA AGT ACT GCT TGG C-3′. The MGB probe was VIC-labeled at the 5′-end and non-fluorescent quencher (NFQ) was attached to the 3′-end of the probe (QPCR-Cygb-Probe: VIC-5′-CTG GTG AGG TTC TTT GTG-3′-NFQ). To verify the results obtained by the TaqMan method we also used the For and Rev oligonucleotide primers in a SYBR Green assay. For real-time RT-PCR experiments, carried out on an ABI PRISM 7000 SDS, we always used 2 μl of the undiluted cDNA synthesis reaction in a 20-μl volume. Normalization was to rRNA (quantified before by optical density) since >95% of total RNA consists of rRNA. In each PCR we thus used the amount of cDNA that is equivalent to 100 ng of total RNA. Amplification of Cygb was performed using the Quantitect Probe PCR Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). The final primer concentration during PCR was 0.19 μm (for both TaqMan and SYBR Green assay), the TaqMan probe concentration was 0.2 μm. The cycling protocol was 95 °C for 15 min for the activation of the polymerase, followed by 94 °C for 15 s and 60 °C for 1 min (40 repetitions). The amplification reaction was performed in a regular three-step protocol: 94 °C for 15 s, 60 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 30 s, measuring the fluorescence during the last step of each cycle. SYBR Green analyses were followed by dissociation curves in a temperature range from 60 to 92 °C to analyze the specificity of the amplification reactions. Quantification was performed by dividing the mean value of expression of the hypoxic sample through that of the normoxic sample. This quotient represents the factor of higher or lower expression in hypoxic versus normoxic sample. Statistical evaluation was performed by calculating the mean value of the factors of regulation and their standard deviation. The significance of the data was assessed by the two-tailed Student's t test. Antibodies Against Cygb—Four polyclonal antibodies that are directed against different synthetic Cygb peptides (Fig. 1A) were raised in rabbits. After purification by affinity chromatography, the antibodies (αCygb1-4) showed strong positive reaction with recombinant Cygb in Western blotting and in ELISA (see Supplemental Data, Fig. S1). The reaction was inhibited by preadsorption of the antibodies with a 100-fold molar excess of purified recombinant Cygb, demonstrating a specific interaction with the antigen. Three of the antibodies (αCygb1-3) gave essentially identical results in immunofluorescence experiments, while no specific immunostaining was observed with the fourth antibody (αCygb4) (see Supplemental Data Fig. S2). The antibodies were further tested on various tissues by Western blotting. Only antibodies αCygb2 and αCygb3 showed the expected bands of 21 kDa in various tissues, which is about the same size as the recombinant protein (Fig. 1B). The antibodies are directed against peptides from the globin D-helix, and the EF-region, respectively (Fig. 1A). The additional bands observed in the Western blot at various positions in some tissues represent nonspecific cross-reactions and do not disappear by preadsorption of the antibody with recombinant Cygb (see Supplemental Data Fig. S3). By contrast, the staining of the Cygb band is specific and was blocked by preadsorption. Antibodies αCygb1 and αCygb4, directed against the N or C terminus, respectively, showed only weak reactions in Western blot experiments. Detection of Cygb mRNA and Protein in Mammalian Tissues—The presence of Cygb mRNA in a broad range of tissues was confirmed by Northern blotting (Fig. 2). Using a radioactively labeled cDNA probe, we detected Cygb at different levels in all organs tested. The Cygb mRNA forms a single band of about 2 kb, which agrees well with the size predicted from EST data (accession numbers BC018822 and NM_134268). Examination of various organs with antibodies αCygb1-3 showed Cygb protein to be present in distinct cell populations (Fig. 3). In the liver, strong staining was observed in the small hepatic stellate cells (HSCs), which are scattered between the large hepatocytes (Fig. 3, A and C). In addition, fibroblasts forming the connective tissue in the vicinity of blood vessels are decorated with the antibodies. Immunostaining was inhibited after preadsorption of the antibodies with the recombinant antigen (Fig. 3B). No reaction was observed in hepatocytes, endothelial, as well as sinusoidal and red blood cells. Cygb was found in the cytoplasm of the HSCs, while there was no detectable labeling of the nuclei (Fig. 3C). The fibroblasts were decorated with the Cygb antibodies in heart, muscle, colon, kidney, and tendon (Fig. 3, D-G). Particularly strong immunofluorescence was observed in the connective tissue of the Lamina propria mucosae that supports the gut epithelium of the colon (Fig. 3E). In the cartilage of the tracheal wall, about 10% of the chondral cells were found to be stained, which we suspect to be the active chondroblasts, while in the mature chondrocytes no Cygb was detected (Fig. 3H). In the tendon, the matrix fibroblasts were strongly labeled, while less intense staining was present in fibroblasts of the adjacent muscle (Fig. 3I). Cytoglobin expression was also observed in skin fibroblasts (data not shown). The osteoblasts and the osteocytes of the bones were both stained with the antibodies, with the osteocytes showing a weak labeling (Fig. 3J). As in the HSCs (Fig. 3C), anti-Cygb labeling in the fibroblasts, chondroblasts, osteoblasts, and osteocytes was apparently restricted to and uniformly distributed within the cytoplasm, and was also present in cytoplasmic extensions (Fig. 3, D, E, and G-J). No staining of the extracellular matrix or the nuclei of these cells was detected with any of the antibodies. Most other cell types of these organs, such as the endothelial cells in the kidney and the colon (Fig. 3, E and G), the goblet cells of the colon mucosa, and the muscle cells in the heart (Fig. 3D) or the skeletal muscle (Fig. 3I) did not show any signal that was considered to be above background. Furthermore, we found the neurons of the myenteric plexus in the colon to expres"
https://openalex.org/W2082625926,"Abstract How different extracellular stimuli can evoke different spatiotemporal Ca2+ signals is uncertain. We have elucidated a novel paradigm whereby different agonists use different Ca2+-storing organelles (“organelle selection”) to evoke unique responses. Some agonists select the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), and others select lysosome-related (acidic) organelles, evoking spatial Ca2+ responses that mirror the organellar distribution. In pancreatic acinar cells, acetylcholine and bombesin exclusively select the ER Ca2+ store, whereas cholecystokinin additionally recruits a lysosome-related organelle. Similarly, in a pancreatic β cell line MIN6, acetylcholine selects only the ER, whereas glucose mobilizes Ca2+ from a lysosome-related organelle. We also show that the key to organelle selection is the agonist-specific coupling messenger(s) such that the ER is selected by recruitment of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (or cADP-ribose), whereas lysosome-related organelles are selected by NAADP."

We have identified a novel cytochrome P450, CYP2U1, which may play an important role in modulating the arachidonic acid signaling pathway. Northern blot and real-time PCR analysis demonstrated that CYP2U1 transcripts were most abundant in the thymus and the brain (cerebellum), indicating a specific physiological role for CYP2U1 in these tissues. Recombinant human CYP2U1 protein, expressed in baculovirus-infected Sf9 insect cells, was found to metabolize arachidonic acid exclusively to two region-specific products as determined by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. These metabolites were identified as 19- and 20-hydroxy-modified arachidonic acids by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry analysis. In addition to ω/ω-1 hydroxylation of arachidonic acid, CYP2U1 protein also catalyzed the hydroxylation of structurally related long chain fatty acid (docosahexaenoic acid) but not fatty acids such as lauric acid or linoleic acid. This is the first report of the cloning and functional expression of a new human member of P450 family 2, CYP2U1, which metabolizes long chain fatty acids. Based on the ability of CYP2U1 to generate bioactive eicosanoid derivatives, we postulate that CYP2U1 plays an important physiological role in fatty acid signaling processes in both cerebellum and thymus.

Falck J.R. Harris R.C. J. Lipid Res. 2000; 41: 163-181Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This diverse group of substrates is composed of prostaglandins, thromboxanes, lipoxins, leukotrienes, as well as epoxy- and hydroxy-modified arachidonic acids (EETs and HETEs, respectively) and is involved in regulation of local blood flow (2Capdevila J.H.

The identification and characterization of the enzymatic processes involved in generating and metabolizing these important signaling molecules are critical for understanding the role of these molecules in health and disease. Arachidonic acid is an abundant component of cell membrane phospholipids and is released by phospholipase A2 in response to extracellular signals (12Bazan N.G. Tu B. Rodriguez de Turco E.B. Prog. Brain Res. 2002; 135: 175-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). All mammalian cells except erythrocytes convert AA into bioactive eicosanoids (13Funk C.D. Science. 2001; 294: 1871-1875Crossref PubMed Scopus (3070) Google Scholar) using some or all of the following three enzymatic pathways: 1) the cyclooxygenase pathway that leads to the synthesis of numerous prostaglandins, prostacyclins, and thromboxanes (14Imig J.D.

Res. 2002; 25: 747-758Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar); 3) the AA monooxygenase pathway that creates EETs and HETEs and consists of P450s possessing epoxygenase, lipoxygenase-like, or ω/ω-1 hydroxylase activity (16Capdevila J.H. Harris R.C. Falck J.R. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2002; 59: 780-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The first two enzymatic cascades involve multiple P450s responsible for the synthesis of secondary eicosanoids. Cytochrome P450 epoxygenases synthesize four regio-epoxy isomers 5, 6-EET, 8, 9-EET, 11,12-EET and 14,15-EET (16Capdevila J.H. Harris R.C. Falck J.R. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2002; 59: 780-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), which can be further converted by epoxide hydrolases to corresponding dihydroxyeicosatrienoic acids (17Fang X. Kaduce T.L. Weintraub N.L. Harmon S. Teesch L.M. Morisseau C. Thompson D.A. Hammock B.D. Spector A.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 14867-14874Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Lipoxygenase-like P450s create 5-HETE, 8-HETE, 9-HETE, 11-HETE, 12-HETE, or 15-HETE (16Capdevila J.H. Harris R.C. Falck J.R. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2002; 59: 780-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). ω/ω-1-Hydroxylase converts AA into 20-HETE, 19-HETE, 18-HETE, 17-HETE, or 16-HETE (18Oliw E.H. Prog. Lipid Res. 1994; 33: 329-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). All of the above products can be modified further into additional eicosanoids. Arachidonic acid monooxygenase activity was first characterized in microsomal fractions obtained from kidney and liver (18Oliw E.H. Prog. Lipid Res. 1994; 33: 329-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). More recently, numerous tissue-specific AA-metabolizing P450s have been identified in human and animal tissues. For example, human hepatic CYP1A2 (19Rifkind A.B. Lee C. Chang T.K. Waxman D.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 320: 380-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar, 20Bylund J. Kunz T. Valmsen K.

Human CYP2J2 activity results in the accumulation of all four EETs (22Wu S. Moomaw C.R. Tomer K.B. Falck J.R. Zeldin D.C. J. Biol.

Tissue- and substrate-specific P450 monooxygenases have gained attention as essential control points in AA signal transduction pathways. In this paper, we report the cloning of a novel human P450, CYP2U1, which is expressed predominantly in thymus and cerebellum. We have determined that CYP2U1 metabolizes AA, docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), and other long chain fatty acids to a series of oxygenated products and might play a significant role in brain and immune functions. Materials—[α-32P]dATP was purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. 20-Hydroxy-AA was purchased from Cayman Chemical (Ann Arbor). [1-14C]Arachidonic, docosahexaenoic, linolenic, eicosapentaenoic (EPA), docosatraenoic (DTA), and eicosatrienoic (ETA) acids and all other chemicals were purchased from Sigma unless specified. Full-length cDNA Cloning and Sequencing—Human EST, genomic and High Throughput Genomic Sequence data bases (NCBI, Bethesda, MD) were searched using TBLASTN, BLASTN, and BLASTX algorithms. EST clone AI216236 and genomic clone AC000016 were identified and purchased from Research Genetics (Birmingham, AL). Custom oligonucleotide synthesis and DNA sequencing were performed by Cortec (Kingston, ON, Canada). A human thymus 5′-STRETCH Plus cDNA library (Clontech) was screened according to the manufacturer's instructions. A [α-32P]dATP-radiolabeled probe was prepared by random priming using as template a purified 380-bp fragment of EST clone AI216236 corresponding to nucleotides 1400-1779 (accession no. AY343323). One clone was identified, and based on the sequence data this clone lacked the 5′- and 3′-ends. To obtain the full-length cDNA sequence of CYP2U1, the 5′- and 3′-ends were amplified using the SMART RACE cDNA amplification kit (as per the manufacturer's instructions, Clontech) and thymus cDNA as template. CYP2U1 specific primers 5′-GTT GCT TGG ATT CAC TGT CCT T-3′, 5′-GGT TTC TCC CAA ATG GCT GGG TCT CT-3′, and 5′-CCA CAG TTA GCC TCT GCA CTT CC-3′ were synthesized and used with the primers provided in the amplification kit. Unique PCR products were then cloned into a pTAdv vector (Clontech) and sequenced. The full-length clone of CYP2U1 (accession no. AY343323) was assembled from the various fragments using a homologous recombination kit (Pangene, Fremont CA) as per the manufacturer's instructions. Phylogenetic Analyses—For multiple alignment of P450 sequences, the ClustalV method described by Higgins and Sharp (25Higgins D.G. Sharp P.M. Comput. Appl. Biosci. 1989; 5: 151-153PubMed Google Scholar) was used with a gap penalty and a gap length penalty of 10 and PAM250 residue weight table. Real-time PCR Analysis of CYP2U1 Expression in Human Tissues—A cDNA panel from 24 different human tissues was purchased from Origene Technologies Inc. (Rockville, MD). Human thymus and cerebellum poly(A) RNA samples were obtained from Clontech, and human kidney poly(A)+ RNA was obtained from Ambion (Austin, TX). Aliquots of the RNAs were reverse transcribed using random hexamers and Thermoscript reverse transcriptase according to the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen). Primers for human CYP2U1 were designed to ensure specific amplification of a 194-bp fragment of the cDNA. The sequences of these primers were as follows: forward, 5′-GCA TCG AGC AGA ACA TTC GCG CCA-3′; and reverse, 5′-CTG GTG CCT GCT GTA TAT GCT GCT G-3′. Quantitative real-time PCR was performed using SYBR Green PCR Master Mix according to the manufacturer's instructions (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) with minor revisions. Briefly, PCR amplifications were conducted in 25-μl reactions using 60 cycles. Each cDNA sample was tested in triplicate. Real-time PCR was performed on an ABI Prism 7000 sequence detection system (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). After amplification, a dissociation curve was performed on all PCR products to ensure that specific PCR products were generated. The real-time PCR results were analyzed using the sequence detection system software V1.0 (Applied Biosystems). The CYP2U1 expression levels were calculated using the comparative CT method and normalized to β-actin (cDNA panel) or glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (mRNA) expression levels. Heterologous Expression of Recombinant CYP2U1 in Insect Cells— PCR-generated cDNA coding region of CYP2U1 (pVL-CYP2U1) and His6-tagged CYP2U1 (pVL-CYP2U1-His6) were subcloned into pVL1392 baculovirus transfer vector (BD Biosciences). Full-length human cytochrome b5 (hb5) and cytochrome P450-NADPH reductase (hOR) cDNAs were isolated from thymus total RNA by reverse transcription-PCR with specific primers. The forward primers, 5′-ATC CCG GGA TGG CAG AGC AGT CGG ACG AG-3′ and 5′-ATA GAT CTG AAA TGG GAG ACT CCC TGG AC-3′, and the reverse primers, 5′-ATG GAT CCT CAG TCC TCT GCC ATG TAT AGG-3′ and 5′-ATG AAT TCC TAG CTC CAC ACG TCC AGG G-3′, were used for PCR amplification of hb5 and hOR, respectively. Both cDNAs were then subcloned together into a pAcDB3 transfer vector (BD Biosciences). Cultured Sf9 insect cells were cotransfected with each of the expression vectors using the Baculo-Gold baculovirus expression system according to manufacturer's instructions (BD Biosciences). As a control, the linearized wild-type Baculo-Gold viral DNA was used. Recombinant viruses were purified, and the presence of CYP2U1, hb5 cDNA, and hOR cDNAs was confirmed by PCR analysis. Cultured Sf9 insect cells were grown in Spinner flasks in TNM-FH medium. Cultures were supplemented with hemin, δ-aminolevulinic acid, and ferric citrate (final concentration 2 μg/ml, 100 μm, and 100 μm, respectively) just prior to infection with recombinant baculovirus. Seventy-two hours later, transfected cells were harvested, and crude microsomal preparations were prepared as described by Zeldin et al. (26Zeldin D.C. DuBois R.N. Falck J.R. Capdevila J.H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 322: 76-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Total protein concentration was estimated by the bicinchoninic acid method. Microsomal preparations were stored in small aliquots in liquid nitrogen. The presence of a functional CYP2U1 protein in the microsomal preparation was confirmed by reduced carbon monoxide difference spectroscopic analysis. Immunoblot Analysis of CYP2U1 Expression—Polyclonal rabbit antibodies were raised against keyhole limpet hemocyanin-conjugated oligopeptide IKDHQESLDRENPQD corresponding to amino acids 302-316 of the CYP2U1 protein. Peptide synthesis and immunizations were conducted by Research Genetics (Huntsville, AL). Sf9 insect cells and CYP2U1-transfected Sf9 cells were lysed and analyzed in 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels (under reducing conditions). Western blots were performed according to the manufacturer's chemiluminescence detection system instructions (Amersham Biosciences) and hybridized with rabbit anti-CYP2U1 polyclonal antibody or anti-His6 monoclonal antibody (Invitrogen). Metabolism of Fatty Acids and Product Characterization—Sf9 cell microsomal preparations (0.1-1 mg of protein/ml final concentration) were diluted in assay buffer (0.1 m potassium phosphate, pH 7.4, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA). When necessary, exogenous substrate (up to 100 μm final concentration) was added in ethanol solution. The mixture was preincubated at 37 °C for 5 min in a water bath under constant mixing. The reactions were started by the addition of NADPH-regenerating mix (1 mm NADPH, 1 unit/ml glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, 2 mm glucose 6-phosphate, final concentration) and carried out for 5-60 min at 37 °C. Aliquots were taken and stopped with acetic acid. An internal standard (100 ng of myristic acid) was added to each reaction, and the samples were extracted twice with acidified ethyl acetate. The metabolites were analyzed by LC-MS. Inhibition studies were conducted as described above in the presence of 0.1-50 μm ketoconazole or 17-octodecynoic acid (17-ODYA). HPLC and MS Analysis—LC-MS was performed using a Micromass Quattro Ultima triple-stage quadrupole mass spectrometer (Manchester, UK) connected to a Waters Alliance 2969 HPLC system equipped with a photodiode array UV (200-400 nm) detector (Milford, MA). The analytical column was a Zorbax C18 Eclipse XDB 150 × 2.1 mm (inner diameter) (5-μm particle size) (Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, CA) and maintained at 25 °C. Fast separation was achieved using a 30-min HPLC linear gradient at a flow rate of 0.2 ml/min. The mobile phase consisted of water (solvent A), acetonitrile (solvent B), and 10% glacial acetic acid (solvent C). The initial mobile phase conditions were set at 39.5% A, 59.5% B, and 1% C. Solvent B was then increased to 99% with a constant flow of 1% C. The mobile phase was then held isocratically for 10 min at 99% B and 1% C before returning to the initial conditions. For better separation of metabolites, the following HPLC linear gradient at a flow rate of 0.2 ml/min was used. Initial mobile phase conditions were set at 54% A, 45% B, and 1% C for 1 min. Solvent B was increased to 55% B with a constant flow of 1% C at 30 min. The mobile phase was then held isocratically for 10 min at a composition of 44% A, 55% B, and 1% C. Solvent B was increased to 99% in 5 min while maintaining C at 1%. The mobile phase was held isocratically for 15 min before returning to the initial conditions over 5 min and equilibrating for 5 min. The mass spectrometer was operated in negative electrospray mode with a -2.86-kV capillary voltage and -16-V cone voltage. Nitrogen was used as a drying gas. Solvent flow rate was fixed at 200 μl/min with a cone gas flow of 112 liters/h, desolvation gas flow of 778 liters/h, a source temperature of 149 °C, and a desolvation temperature of 200 °C. For tandem MS experiments, argon was used as a collision gas at a pressure of 2.3 × 10-3 torr with collision energy of 22 V. The quadrupole mass resolution settings were fixed at 15.0, and the multiplier voltage was 650 V. The ion source and the mass spectrometer parameters were optimized by infusion of 10 μl/min AA standard solution into the HPLC eluent (75% acetonitrile, 24% water, and 1% of 10% glacial acetic acid) flowing at 200 μl/min. The mass spectrometer was operated in a full mass scan (m/z 150-500) and product ion scan mode. Metabolites of AA were characterized by performing product ion scans of the molecular ion. Competition Assay—Microsomes isolated from CYP2U1-transfected Sf9 cells were incubated as described above with 2.5 μm [1-14C]AA and 0-25 μm unlabeled fatty acids. In these experiments, AA metabolism was measured for each concentration of EPA, DHA, DTA, ETA, and linolenic acid and plotted on a graph to determine whether these compounds compete with AA for the substrate binding site. Molecular Cloning of CYP2U1 cDNA—In an effort to discover novel human P450s, we searched the human EST data base using TBLASTN with a consensus sequence for the P450 heme binding domain PF(G/S)XGX(A/R/H)XCXG. One of the identified sequences (accession no. AI216236) closely matched a partial genomic sequence (accession no. AC00016) that was selected in a similar search of the human genomic data base. To identify which tissue RNA should be used for the full-length cloning of this novel human P450, we screened a human RNA dot blot containing poly(A)+ RNA samples from a variety of tissues and cell lines using a 381-bp probe from the EST clone AI216236. A strong hybridization signal was detected on dot blots loaded with mRNA from adult and fetal thymus tissue (data not shown). Subsequently, we screened a human thymus cDNA library that resulted in an assembly of full-length cDNA (3,544 nucleotides) encoding 544 amino acids (Fig. 1). The predicted amino acid sequence contains many of the hallmark features of cytochrome P450s (27Werck-Reichhart D. Feyereisen R. Genome. Biol. 2000; 1 (REVIEWS3003)Crossref PubMed Google Scholar): heme binding domain PFGIGKRVCMGA (underlined are the amino acids from position 482 to 492 which are conserved in the heme binding domain (with the axial Cys ligand in bold to the heme)); PERF domain (PNRF position 464 to 467) which forms an ERR triad (28Zheng Y.M. Fisher M.B. Yokotani N. Fujii-Kuriyama Y. Rettie A.E. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 12847-12851Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), using Glu and Arg from the K-helix domain and Arg from the PERF domain; ETLR domain (EVQR) conserved sequence was also found 50 amino acids upstream the PERF domain. The CYP2U1 designation for this gene was approved by the Cytochrome P450 Nomenclature Committee (Dr. David Nelson Web Page: www.drnelson.utmem.edu/CytochromeP450.html). CYP2U1 gene has five exons (Fig. 1) and therefore differs from most of the CYP2 family members, which have nine exons. In the CYP2U1 gene, the position of introns 1, 2, and 4 is conserved with other members of the CYP2 family; however, the third intron position is different. The alignment analysis of CYP2U1 amino acid sequence reveals that it has the highest percentages of identity to fish AA epoxygenases, CYP2N1 and CYP2N2, with 39.6 and 38.4% identity, respectively (29Oleksiak M.F.

A phylogenetic comparison of amino acid sequence with other human CYPs showed that CYP2U1 is most closely related to CYP2J2 (30Zeldin D.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 36059-36062Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (547) Google Scholar), an AA epoxygenase gene, and CYP2R1, a microsomal vitamin D 25-hydroxylase (31Cheng J.B. Motola D.L. Mangelsdorf D.J. Russell D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 38084-38093Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar) with 36 and 37.1% amino acid sequence identity, respectively (Fig. 2). Tissue Distribution of CYP2U1 mRNA—The expression of CYP2U1 mRNA was determined in the human by real-time PCR (Fig. 3). These experiments revealed that CYP2U1 mRNA was most abundant in the thymus and cerebellum and present at lower levels in numerous other tissues. The quantitative analysis showed that CYP2U1 expression in thymus is ∼3-fold higher than in the cerebellum and about 200 magnitudes higher compared with other tissues. Recombinant Expression of CYP2U1 in Sf9 Insect Cells—To characterize the substrate and enzymatic activity of CYP2U1, we used baculovirus to express CYP2U1 protein. A recombinant CYP2U1-His6 protein was coexpressed with hOR and hb5 in Sf9 insect cells. The protein expression was verified by Western blot and spectral analysis. The anti-His6 antibody cross-reacted with a ∼55-60-kDa protein present in the microsomal fraction of infected Sf9 cells (Fig. 4A). In addition, anti-CYP2U1 antibody confirmed the presence of CYP2U1 protein (Fig. 4B). Spectral analysis using microsomal fraction from Sf9 cells infected with CYP2U1 baculovirus showed a characteristic carbon monoxide/reduced 450 nm absorption peak (Fig. 4C). From these data, we estimated the presence of 0.5 nmol of recombinant CYP2U1 protein per mg of total protein in microsomal fractions. Metabolism of Arachidonic Acid by CYP2U1—Sequence similarities between CYP2U1 and others CYP2 family members prompted us to study the potential role of CYP2U1 in fatty acid metabolism. Microsomal fractions containing recombinant CYP2U1 protein were incubated in the presence of 10 μm exogenous AA and analyzed by LC-MS at different time intervals. Arachidonic acid was metabolized by CYP2U1 in a time-dependent manner and with an apparent Km value of 2.7 μm. LC-MS chromatograms revealed the presence of two more polar, water-soluble metabolites of AA as indicated in Fig. 5 as peak 1 and peak 2. These compounds were identified based on MS data. The negative electrospray mode mass spectrum of the two products is shown in Fig. 6. The [M-H]- ion at m/z 319 corresponds to a single carboxylate anion of oxygenated derivatives of AA (HETE). The product ion spectrum of the two oxygenated derivatives is shown in Fig. 6, A and B. For peak 1, the product ion spectrum yielded fragment ions at m/z 301, 275, 259, 231, 203, 177, 135, 121, and 107. The fragment at m/z 231 probably arises from the combined loss of CO2 and CH2OH (see inset of Fig. 6A). The product ion spectrum of peak 1 yields characteristic fragment ions at m/z 275 and 231, which were reported previously by Bylund and coauthors (21Bylund J. Ericsson J. Oliw E.H. Anal. Biochem. 1998; 265: 55-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar) to be characteristic fragments for 19-HETE.Fig. 6CYP2U1 metabolizes AA to 19- and 20-HETE.

Drawings represent predicted 19- and 20-HETE fragmentation scenarios, respectively.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The product ion spectrum of the second metabolite (peak 2) yielded fragment ions at m/z 301, 289, 275, 257, 245, 109, 107, and 97, with two characteristic signals at m/z 289 and 245 (21Bylund J. Ericsson J. Oliw E.H. Anal. Biochem. 1998; 265: 55-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). The fragment at m/z 245 might be the result of the combined loss of CO2 and CH2O (see inset, Fig. 6B). The retention time and product ion spectrum of this metabolite (peak 2) were consistent with the formation of 20-HETE. Moreover, the use of a reference confirmed the identity of peak 2 as 20-HETE (data not shown). From these observations, it was confirmed that CYP2U1 converts AA into two bioactive derivatives, 19- and 20-HETE. CYP2U1 Substrate Specificity—To assess the substrate binding properties of different fatty acids to CYP2U1, competition experiments using 2.5 μm [1-14C]AA and different concentrations (up to 25 μm) of unlabeled fatty acids were conducted. In these experiments, we measured a concentration-dependent decrease in AA metabolism when linolenic acid, EPA, DHA, and ETA were added to the incubation, confirming their ability to compete with AA for the binding site of CYP2U1 (data not shown). To characterize further the substrate specificity of CYP2U1, incubations of fatty acids with different chain lengths or degrees of saturation were conducted. HPLC analysis demonstrated that linolenic acid, EPA, ETA, and DHA are substrates of recombinant CYP2U1 (Figs. 7 and 8 and Table I). In the case of DHA, Fig. 7 shows the LC-MS chromatogram of more polar metabolites generated by CYP2U1. The two metabolites have a retention time in our HPLC conditions of 26.9 and 37 min, for peak A and B, respectively. In contrast to the mass to charge ratio of the deprotonated DHA ([M-H]- = 327), the [M-H]- for these two metabolites is equal to 343, which could correspond to the addition of one molecular oxygen ([M-H]- + 16). Based on this observation, we postulate that the metabolites formed correspond to a ω- and (ω-1)-hydroxylated DHA or to an epoxy-DHA such as 19,20-epoxydocosapentaenoic acid. Because of the absence of available reference compounds, the identification of metabolites formed could not be established. Moreover, CYP2U1 did not show an"

Mutational inactivation in the tumor suppressor adenomatous polyposis coli (APC), as well as activation of β-catenin, causes the accumulation of β-catenin, which in turn associates with the T cell factor/lymphoid enhancer factor (TCF/LEF) family of transcription factors and activates transcription of their target genes. Here we show that β-catenin activates transcription of the BMP and activin membrane-bound inhibitor (BAMBI)/NMA gene. The expression level of BAMBI was found to be aberrantly elevated in most colorectal and hepatocellular carcinomas relative to the corresponding non-cancerous tissues. Expression of BAMBI in colorectal tumor cell lines was repressed by a dominant-negative mutant of TCF-4 or by an inhibitor of β-catenin-TCF interaction, suggesting that β-catenin is responsible for the aberrant expression of BAMBI in colorectal tumor cells. Furthermore, overexpression of BAMBI inhibited the response of tumor cells to transforming growth factor-β signaling. These results suggest that β-catenin interferes with transforming growth factor-β-mediated growth arrest by inducing the expression of BAMBI, and this may contribute to colorectal and hepatocellular tumorigenesis.

By recruiting β-catenin into this multi-protein complex, APC promotes its proteasome-mediated degradation, hence mutations in APC or β-catenin result in the accumulation of β-catenin in colorectal tumor cells (31Aberle H.

Mutations in β-catenin and Axin have also been identified in many other types of tumors, including hepatocellular carcinoma, ovarian cancer, and endometrial cancer (33Munemitsu S. Albert I.

Thus, constitutive activation of β-catenin-TCF-mediated transcription is believed to be a critical step in the tumorigenesis of various types of tumors. The transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) pathway inhibits the growth of multiple epithelial cell types, and loss of this negative regulation is believed to contribute to tumor development, including colorectal tumorigenesis. Indeed, inactivating mutations in the type II receptor (TβRII), SMAD2, and SMAD4 have been reported to occur during colorectal tumorigenesis. In addition, it has been reported that the TGF-β receptor is often down-regulated in tumor cells, or otherwise unavailable at the cell surface, thus allowing tumor cells to escape the growth inhibitory activities of TGF-β (36Derynck R. Akhurst R.J. Balmain A. Nat. Genet. 2001; 29: 117-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (1963) Google Scholar, 37Massague J. Blain S.W. Lo R.S. Cell. 2000; 103: 295-309Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2078) Google Scholar). TGF-β signals through a heteromeric cell-surface complex of two types of transmembrane serine/threonine kinases, the type I (TβRI) and type II receptors. TβRII activates TβRI, which, in turn, propagates the TGF-β signal by phosphorylating the Smads, Smad2 and Smad3 (38Massague J. Chen Y.G. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 627-644Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 39Miyazono K. ten Dijke P. Heldin C.H. Adv. Immunol. 2000; 75: 115-157Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Receptor-mediated phosphorylation of Smads induces their association with Smad4, followed by translocation into the nucleus, where these complexes activate transcription of target genes, including cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors p15INK4B and p21CIP1 (40Hannon G.J.

Inhibitor of β-catenin-TCF (ICAT) is a β-catenin-interacting protein that interferes with the interaction between β-catenin and TCF and inhibits the proliferation of colorectal tumor cells containing mutations in APC or β-catenin and hepatocellular carcinoma cells containing mutations in Axin (42Tago K.

In the present study, we examined the effects of ICAT on gene expression in the human colorectal tumor cell line SW48, in which β-catenin-TCF4-mediated transcription is aberrantly activated because of a mutation in β-catenin. We found that ICAT suppresses expression of the BAMBI (BMP and activin membrane-bound inhibitor). Furthermore, we found that β-catenin activates transcription of BAMBI and that BAMBI expression is aberrantly elevated in most colorectal and hepatocellular carcinomas, compared with the corresponding non-cancerous tissues. The product of the BAMBI gene is a transmembrane protein that lacks an intracellular kinase domain but has sequence similarity to the extracellular domain of TβRI and thereby inhibits TGF-β signaling by forming a heterodimer with TβRII (46Onichtchouk D. Chen Y.G. Dosch R. Gawantka V. Delius H. Massague J. Niehrs C. Nature. 1999; 401: 480-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (565) Google Scholar). Our data suggest that β-catenin-mediated overexpression of BAMBI may be one of the strategies by which tumor cells escape the growth inhibitory activities of TGF-β. Construction of Plasmids and Recombinant Viruses—For construction of the BAMBI-luciferase reporter plasmids, a human bacterial artificial chromosome clone RP13-43N24, which contains the entire promoter region and several exons and introns, was purchased from BACPAC Resources. The longest construct (7.1 kb) and deletion constructs were generated by cloning each sequence into the appropriate enzyme site in the pGL3-basic vector (Promega). Site-directed mutagenesis of each TCF/LEF binding element was created by standard PCR techniques using Pyrobest DNA polymerase (TAKARA), with the following primers (substituted nucleotides are written in boldface); for TBE1, 5′-GCTGCAGAGGATTGATTAGCGGTAG-3′ and 5′-CTACCGCTAATCAATCCTCTGCAGC-3′; for TBE2, 5′-CTCTGTGTCTAGTTAAATGTATCTCTG-3′ and 5′-CAGAGATACATTTAACTAGACACAGAG-3′; for TBE3, 5′-CTCTAAGTGTAGTTATATCTCTGAATG-3′ and 5′-CATTCAGAGATATAACTACACTTAGAG-3′; for TBE4, 5′-CTGGAAATATAGAAAGCGGGCAGAAC-3′ and 5′-GTTCTGCCCGCTTTCTATATTTCCAG-3′; for TBE5, 5′-CTAAAAGTTCATGCAGTTAAATTTGGG-3′ and 5′-CCCAAATTTAACTGCATGAACTTTTAG-3′, for TBE1′, 5′-CCGTGCTGCTCGCCAAATGTGGGTGCC-3′ and 5′-GGCACCCACATTTGGCGAGCAGCACGG-3′, for TBE2′, 5′-CGCCGCGGGGATTTGGCGCCGGCTGC-3′ and 5′-GCAGCCGGCGCCAAATCCCCGCGGCG-3′, for TBE3′, 5′-GTTGCTGTGTTATTAGCAGTCGCGGCG-3′ and 5′-CGCCGCGACTGCTAATAACTCTGCAAC-3′, for TBE4′, 5′-CGGACTCCGAGCTAATGGCAGGCGCTG-3′ and 5′-CAGCGCCTGCCATTAGCTCGGAGTCCG-3′. pTOP-tk-luciferase and pFOP-tk-luciferase were kindly provided by V. Korinek and H. Clevers (University Medical Center, Utrecht, The Netherlands). The adenoviruses encoding myc-ICAT and LacZ were generated as described previously (43Sekiya T. Nakamura T. Kazuki Y. Oshimura M. Kohu K. Tago K. Ohwada S. Akiyama T. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 3322-3326PubMed Google Scholar). Ad-FLAG-β-catenin S33Y was constructed using the pAdenoX™ Expression system (Clontech) according to the manufacturer's directions. For BAMBI expression plasmids, the full-length BAMBI-GFP fusion expression vector pEGFP-N3-hBAMBI was constructed by cloning RT-PCR products into the pEGFP-N3 vector (Clontech). A variant of this vector, containing BAMBI but lacking amino acids 20-131 (BAMBIΔN), was constructed similarly. Cells and Clinical Materials—All cells were cultured as monolayers in appropriate media: Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (NISSUI) for COS-1 and DU145 cells; Leibovit's L-15 (Sigma) for SW48 and SW480 cells; and McCoy's 5A (Sigma) for HCT116 cells, supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (JCS). All cells were maintained at 37 °C in an atmosphere of humidified air with 5% CO2. Cancerous tissues and corresponding noncancerous tissue samples were excised during surgery at the Gunma University Hospital, after informed consent had been obtained. Northern Blotting—Total RNA was extracted using NucleoSpin (Macherey-Nagel GmbH and Co.). Total RNA (20 μg per lane) was electrophoresed on a formaldehyde-containing 1% agarose gel, transferred onto a Hybond-N+ (Amersham Biosciences), hybridized with 32P-labeled cDNA probe specific for indicated genes, and examined by means of a BAS1500 Phosphorimaging System (Fuji Film). Antibodies—Antibodies to the amino- and carboxyl-terminal regions of BAMBI were prepared by immunizing rabbits with bacterially expressed, glutathione S-transferase fusion proteins containing human BAMBI amino acids 45-147 and 177-241, respectively. Rabbit polyclonal antibody to ICAT was prepared as described (42Tago K. Nakamura T. Nishita M. Hyodo J. Nagai S. Murata Y. Adachi S. Ohwada S. Morishita Y. Shibuya H. Akiyama T. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1741-1749PubMed Google Scholar). Mouse monoclonal antibody to α-tubulin was purchased from Oncogene™. Mouse monoclonal antibody to FLAG (M2) and β-galactosidase (Ab-1) were purchased from Sigma and Calbiochem, respectively. Immunoblotting was performed as described previously (11Matsumine A. Ogai A. Senda T. Okumura N. Satoh K. Baeg G.H. Kawahara T. Kobayashi S. Okada M. Toyoshima K. Akiyama T. Science. 1996; 272: 1020-1023Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar). Luciferase Reporter Assays—Cells were plated in 12-well dishes 18 h prior to transfection. Transfections were performed with LipofectAMINE Plus (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Luciferase assays were performed using the Dual-Luciferase Reporter assay system (Promega) following the manufacturer's protocol. Semi-quantitative RT-PCR Assay—Total RNA was extracted from cancerous and corresponding noncancerous tissues, using NucleoSpin (Macherey-Nagel Gmbh and Co.). First-strand cDNA was synthesized by using random hexamers and Superscript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). 1 μl of cDNA from each sample was used for PCR with the PTC-2000 Peltier thermal cycler (MJ Research, Inc.). All of the reactions were performed in 25-μl volumes and amplified for 3 min at 94 °C for initial denaturation, followed by appropriate cycles at 94 °C for 30 s, 62 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 1 min. The PCR products were electrophoresed on a 1% agarose gel and detected by EtBr staining. Immunohistochemical Analysis—Immunostaining of paraffin-embedded tissue sections was performed according to standard procedures. In brief, sections were deparaffinized in xylene, and then rehydrated into distilled water using graded ethanols. Antigens were retrieved by microwaving the slides in citrate buffer (pH 6.0) for 15 min. Sections were incubated with the indicated antibodies overnight at 4 °C. Staining patterns obtained with the antibodies to β-catenin and BAMBI were visualized with rhodamine isothiocyanate-labeled antimouse antibody and fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled anti-rabbit antibodies, respectively. The sections were visualized and photographed with a confocal microscope. In Fig. 2C (insets, right), COS-1 cells were transfected with FLAG-tagged TCF4-ΔC and stained with ant-FLAG antibody followed by fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled anti-rabbit secondary antibody. The nucleus was stained with TOTO-3 (Molecular Probes). Colony Formation Assay—One day before seeding, DU145 cells were transfected with the indicated plasmids, using LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Cells (5 × 105 cells) were seeded in each 10-cm dish and cultured in the presence or absence of 1 ng/ml TGF-β1 (R & D Systems), under selection with 400 μg/ml G418 (Invitrogen). Change of medium and TGF-β1 stimulation were performed every 5 days. Three weeks after seeding, colonies were either stained with methylene blue or isolated for further experiments. Using a cDNA microarray approach, we examined the effects of ICAT on gene expression in SW48 cells. Infection of SW48 cells with a recombinant adenovirus encoding ICAT (Ad-ICAT) induced changes in the expression levels of a number of genes, including c-MYC, AXIN2, and BCL-XL. We found that one of the genes repressed by Ad-ICAT is BAMBI. To confirm that BAMBI expression is indeed repressed by ICAT, we examined BAMBI expression in SW48 cells infected with Ad-ICAT by RT-PCR analysis (Fig. 1A, left). We found that BAMBI was expressed in SW48 cells and repressed significantly after Ad-ICAT infection, similar to the known β-catenin target gene, AXIN2. In these experiments, expression of adenovirus-transduced genes, ICAT, TCF-4-ΔN (see below), and β-galactosidase, was confirmed by immunoblotting analysis (Fig. 1A, right). We also examined expression of BAMBI protein using antibodies directed against the amino-terminal and carboxyl-terminal regions of human BAMBI, i.e. anti-BAMBI-N-ter and anti-BAMBI-C-ter, respectively. Immunoblotting analysis of the lysates from SW48 cells infected with Ad-ICAT revealed that BAMBI protein expression was also repressed by ICAT (Fig. 1B). These results suggest that the expression of BAMBI is regulated by β-catenin. Therefore, we examined the effect of an active mutant of β-catenin, β-catenin-S33Y, on the expression of BAMBI. β-catenin-S33Y is a mutant that was initially identified in human colorectal tumors, and contains a tyrosine in place of the normal serine at residue 33 (S33Y), a change that renders the protein resistant to APC-mediated degradation (34Morin P.J. Sparks A.B. Korinek V. Barker N. Clevers H. Vogelstein B. Kinzler K.W. Science. 1997; 275: 1787-1790Crossref PubMed Scopus (3505) Google Scholar). Northern blot analysis of RNA isolated from COS-1 cells showed that BAMBI expression is increased after infection with an adenovirus encoding β-catenin-S33Y (Fig. 1C). Immunoblot analysis demonstrated a similar increase in BAMBI protein expression by expression of β-catenin-S33Y (Fig. 1B). Induction of BAMBI was evident within 6 h after Ad-β-catenin-S33Y infection and an ∼5-fold increase was observed at 24 h after infection. To further confirm that expression of BAMBI in SW48 cells is induced by β-catenin-TCF4-mediated transactivation, we examined the effect of a dominant-negative mutant of TCF-4, TCF-4-ΔN, which lacks the amino-terminal β-catenin-binding domain but contains the carboxyl-terminal DNA-binding domain. Expression of BAMBI at both the mRNA and protein levels in SW48 cells was found to be repressed by expression of TCF-4-ΔN (Fig. 1, A and B). These results suggest that expression of BAMBI is regulated by β-catenin-TCF4-mediated transactivation and that the expression of BAMBI in SW48 cells is induced by mutated β-catenin. Next we investigated whether transcription of BAMBI is directly regulated by β-catenin. We isolated a BlnI(-3384)-NcoI(+3866) genomic fragment encompassing the upstream and downstream regions of the transcription start site (Fig. 2A) and examined whether the BAMBI promoter is contained within this fragment. When a XhoI(-586)-NheI(+82) fragment was inserted upstream of a luciferase reporter gene in the sense and antisense orientations and transfected into COS-1 cells, the sense construct exhibited about 170-fold higher luciferase activity than the antisense construct or empty vector (Fig. 2B). Thus, the BAMBI promoter is presumably contained within this fragment. However, the activity of the reporter containing this BAMBI promoter region (Fig. 2A, -586+82-luc) was not enhanced by cotransfection with β-catenin-S33Y (Fig. 2A). Similarly, β-catenin-S33Y did not stimulate the activity of a reporter construct that contains the further upstream regions containing at least three consensus sites for TCF-binding (Fig. 2A, -3384+82-luc). Therefore, we examined the β-catenin responsiveness of the region downstream of the BAMBI promoter (SacI(+421)-SacI(+3806) fragment). We inserted this fragment upstream of the SV40 minimal promoter in a luciferase reporter vector (Fig. 2A, Int1-luc) and examined the construct for responsiveness to β-catenin. When transfected into COS-1 cells, activity of this reporter was found to be enhanced significantly by β-catenin-S33Y (Fig. 2A). These results suggest that this region, which encompasses intron 1, is responsible for β-catenin-mediated transactivation. Intron 1 contains at least five consensus sites for TCF-binding, and synthetic oligonucleotides containing each of these sites demonstrated specific binding to the DNA-binding region of TCF-4, fused to glutathione S-transferase, in an electrophoretic mobility-shift assay (data not shown). Next we examined whether transcription of BAMBI is activated by the endogenous β-catenin-TCF complexes using the colorectal tumor cell lines SW480, HCT116, and SW48. SW480 contains mutated APC and wild-type β-catenin, whereas HCT116 and SW48 possess wild-type APC and mutated β-catenin. The activity of Int1-luc but not -586+82-luc was repressed in a dose-dependent manner in SW480, HCT116, and SW48 cells by a dominant-negative mutant of TCF-4, TCF-4-ΔC, which contains the amino-terminal β-catenin-binding domain but lacks the carboxyl-terminal DNA-binding domain (Fig. 2C). This mutant was constructed as a fusion to the nuclear localization signal of SV40 and was found to localize efficiently to the nucleus (Fig. 2D). Under these experimental conditions, TCF-ΔC also repressed the activity of pTOP-tk-luciferase, which contains optimal TCF-binding sites upstream of a luciferase reporter gene, in these cell lines. These results imply that BAMBI is a direct target for β-catenin-TCF-mediated transactivation. However, we noticed that even when all five consensus TCF-binding sites in Int1-luc were mutated, some β-catenin responsiveness remained (Fig. 2A, Int1-mut1-5-luc). In addition to these five sites, we also mutated four sites in Int1-luc, which diverge one nucleotide from the TCF-binding consensus sequence. This construct (Fig. 2A, Int1-mut-All-luc) exhibited slightly lower activity than Int1-mut-5-luc, suggesting that these sites contribute only a little to β-catenin-mediated transactivation. Furthermore, the β-catenin-mediated transactivation of Int1-luc was only weakly inhibited by TCF-4-ΔN, whereas it was significantly inhibited by ICAT as well as TCF-4-ΔC (Fig. 2D). The weak effect of TCF-4-ΔN is not due to low levels of expression, because immunoblotting analysis revealed that TCF-4-ΔN and TCF-4-ΔC were expressed at similar levels in these experiments. On the other hand, TCF-4-ΔN as well as TCF-4-ΔC and ICAT exhibited significant inhibitory effects on the β-catenin-mediated transactivation of pTOP-tk-luciferase. TCF-4-ΔN differs from TCF-4-ΔC in that the former blocks TCF-binding to DNA, whereas TCF-4-ΔC is able to inhibit the interaction of a number of proteins, including β-catenin. These results suggest that BAMBI may be transcriptionally regulated not only by β-catenin-TCF complexes, but also by β-catenin complexed to other proteins. This finding is consistent with recent reports showing that complexes of β-catenin with partners other than TCF can also transactivate target genes (47Tice D.A. Szeto W. Soloviev I. Rubinfeld B.

Northern blotting analysis revealed that BAMBI is expressed at very low levels in human colon, small intestine, thymus, and peripheral bloods, at moderate levels in brain, skeletal muscle, liver, and lung, and at high levels in heart, spleen, kidney, and placenta (data not shown). Because β-catenin accumulates in most human colorectal tumors due to mutations in APC or β-catenin, we expected BAMBI expression to be up-regulated in colorectal tumors. We examined BAMBI expression in 18 paired colorectal tumors and adjacent non-cancerous tissues by semi-quantitative RT-PCR analysis. In 13 of 18 (72%) cases, the expression level of BAMBI was very high in colorectal tumors but was very low in the corresponding non-cancerous tissues (Fig. 3A). In the other five cases, BAMBI expression was almost equal to or lower than that of the non-cancerous tissues. Immunostaining experiments also demonstrated that BAMBI is expressed at high levels in colorectal tumors but at very low levels in non-cancerous tissues (Fig. 3B). Furthermore, we found that BAMBI expression is higher in hepatocellular carcinomas than in adjacent normal tissues in three of five cases, consistent with the fact that AXIN1 as well as β-catenin is mutated in a certain subset of hepatocellular carcinomas (35Satoh S. Daigo Y. Furukawa Y. Kato T. Miwa N. Nishiwaki T. Kawasoe T. Ishiguro H. Fujita M. Tokino T. Sasaki Y. Imaoka S. Murata M. Shimano T. Yamaoka Y. Nakamura Y. Nat.

Consistent with the fact that expression of AXIN2 is activated by β-catenin and up-regulated in colorectal tumors (25Yan D. Wiesmann M. Rohan M. Chan V. Jefferson A.B. Guo L. Sakamoto D.

Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 1184-1193Crossref PubMed Scopus (839) Google Scholar), we observed that the expression patterns of BAMBI and AXIN2 were similar in most tumors examined. Because BAMBI has been shown to act as an antagonist of TGF-β signaling (46Onichtchouk D. Chen Y.G. Dosch R. Gawantka V. Delius H. Massague J. Niehrs C. Nature. 1999; 401: 480-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (565) Google Scholar, 52Tsang M. Kim R. de Caestecker M.P. Kudoh T. Roberts A.B. Dawid I.B. Genesis. 2000; 28: 47-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), we examined the effect of overexpression of BAMBI on the growth of tumor cells in the presence of TGF-β. In these experiments, we used the prostate tumor cell line DU145, because it responds to TGF-β and does not exhibit aberrant β-catenin-mediated transactivation (data not shown), suggesting that it does not possess mutations in APC, β-catenin, or AXIN. We transfected BAMBI into DU145 cells and performed a colony formation assay in the presence or absence of TGF-β. TGF-β strongly inhibited colony formation among DU145 cells that were transfected with GFP or mutant BAMBI-GFP lacking the amino-terminal extracellular domain (BAMBIΔN-GFP). In contrast, BAMBI-GFP-transfected cells were resistant to the growth inhibitory effects of TGF-β (Fig. 4A). Immunoblotting analysis of BAMBI-GFP-transfected cells propagated from TGF-β-resistant colonies revealed that BAMBI-GFP is indeed expressed in these cells (Fig. 4B). We also examined the effect of BAMBI-GFP on TGF-β-mediated transactivation in DU145 cells using the reporter p3TP-lux, which contains a TGF-β-responsive element from the PAI-1 promoter placed upstream of a luciferase reporter gene. Luciferase assay revealed that TGF-β-mediated transactivation is repressed by exogenously expressed BAMBI-GFP (Fig. 4C). These results imply that BAMBI has the potential to inhibit TGF-β-mediated transactivation and cell growth inhibition. Loss of TGF-β responsiveness provides an advantage for developing tumors (36Derynck R. Akhurst R.J. Balmain A. Nat. Genet. 2001; 29: 117-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (1963) Google Scholar, 37Massague J. Blain S.W. Lo R.S. Cell. 2000; 103: 295-309Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2078) Google Scholar). Most colorectal tumors possess mutations in a component of the TGF-β signaling pathway such as TβRII, SMAD2, or SMAD4. Our results show that, in addition, an inhibitor of TGF-β signaling, BAMBI, is induced by β-catenin and overexpressed in colorectal and hepatocellular carcinoma cells. In the multistep progression into cancer, mutations in the Wnt signaling pathway generally precede those in other tumor suppressor genes and oncogenes (1Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Cell. 1996; 87: 159-170Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4274) Google Scholar, 20Polakis P. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1837-1851Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, it is interesting to speculate that overexpression of BAMBI may allow adenomas and tumor cells to escape the growth inhibitory activities of TGF-β until a component of TGF-β signaling is mutated. BAMBI also interferes with signaling pathways other than that mediated by the SMADs; thus, its overexpression may be more advantageous to oncogenic transformation than mutation of the SMADs alone. It is also possible that β-catenin-induced BAMBI expression plays a role in embryogenesis. These possibilities could be examined using Bambi knockout mice, as well as Apc and Bambi double-knockout mice. Furthermore, our findings suggest that BAMBI may have the potential as a target for therapy using monoclonal antibodies (53Carter P. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2001; 1: 118-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (725) Google Scholar). Development of monoclonal antibodies to BAMBI as anti-tumor reagents is currently under way in our laboratory. We thank I. Saito and Y. Kanegae for helping us to prepare the recombinant adenoviruses, K. Miyazono for p3TP-lux, and M. Lamphier and T. Okabe for reading the manuscript."

It is not clear whether the concept of endosomal signaling could be generally applied to the other receptor tyrosine kinases. For example, platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR) is very similar to EGFR in terms of both signaling and trafficking; however, little is known about the endosomal signaling of PDGFR. In this research, we applied the same approaches from our recent studies regarding EGFR endosomal signaling to investigate the endosomal signaling of PDGFR. We showed in this communication that we are able to establish a system that allows the specific activation of endosome-associated PDGFR without the activation of the plasma membrane-associated PDGFR and without disrupting the overall endocytosis pathway. By using this system, we showed that endosomal activation of PDGFR recruits various signaling proteins including Grb2, SHC, phospholipase C-γ1, and the p85α subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase into endosomes and forms signaling complexes with PDGFR. We also showed that endosomal PDGFR signaling is sufficient to activate the major signaling pathways implicated in cell proliferation and survival.

The formation of receptor-signaling protein complexes then initiates the activation of various signaling pathways including the Ras-ERK pathway, the PI3K-Akt pathway, the PLC-γ1 pathway, and the Src pathway. The activation of these pathways eventually leads to cell proliferation and survival. Concomitantly, these ligand-receptor complexes cluster into clathrin-coated pits, internalize into early endosomes, and eventually traffic to lysosomes for degradation (20Rosenfeld M.E.

Although endocytosis has traditionally been considered a deactivation mechanism for RTKs, accumulated evidence is unveiling a positive signaling role for endosomally localized RTKs (25Wang Y. Pennock S. Chen X. Wang Z. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 7279-7290Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). It is known that certain RTKs remain autophosphorylated and catalytically active following ligand-induced endocytosis (26Cohen S. Fava R.A. J. Biol.

At the endosomal location, EGF·EGFR complexes remain associated with signaling effectors such as Grb2, SHC, p85, and PLC-γ1 (25Wang Y. Pennock S. Chen X. Wang Z. Mol. Cell.

More evidence supporting endosomal signaling comes from endocytosis blocking experiments. Inhibition of EGFR endocytosis modulates EGF-stimulated activation of signaling proteins, especially inhibition of ERK activation (35Jones S.M. Klinghoffer R. Prestwich G.D. Toker A. Kazlauskas A.

Biol. 1986; 6: 1917-1925Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Moreover, ligand-activated EGFR spends more of its lifetime internally than on the cell surface, which further suggests the importance of endosomal signaling of EGFR. Recently, we established a system to specifically activate endosome-associated EGFR in the absence of any plasma membrane activation (25Wang Y. Pennock S. Chen X. Wang Z. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 7279-7290Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). By using this system, we examined the effects of endosomal EGFR signaling on the two major physiological outcomes of EGFR activation, cell survival, and proliferation. We showed that endosomal EGFR signaling is sufficient to elicit cell survival through generation of anti-apoptotic signals in response to serum withdrawal (25Wang Y. Pennock S. Chen X. Wang Z. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 7279-7290Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). We further showed that endosomal EGFR signaling is sufficient to stimulate cell proliferation (54Pennock S. Wang Z. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 5803-5815Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). This demonstrated that endosomal EGFR signaling is sufficient to generate physiological outcome. However, nothing is known about the endosomal signaling of PDGFR. It is not known whether PDGFR can signal from endosomes and whether the endosomal signaling of PDGFR, if it exists, can produce any physiological outcomes. Based on the similarity between PDGFR and EGFR in their trafficking and signaling, it is possible that, like EGFR, PDGFR also signals from endosomes. To test this possibility, we applied the same approaches from our EGFR study (25Wang Y. Pennock S. Chen X. Wang Z. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 7279-7290Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar, 39Wang Y. Pennock S. Chen X. Wang Z. Sci. STKE. 2002; 2002: L17Google Scholar, 54Pennock S. Wang Z. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 5803-5815Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) to investigate the endosomal signaling of PDGFR. We showed in this communication that we are able to establish a system that allows the specific activation of endosome-associated PDGFR without the activation of the plasma membrane-associated PDGFR and without disrupting the overall endocytosis pathway. We treated cells with EGF in the presence of AG1296, a specific PDGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor (40Lipson K.E. Pang L. Huber L.J. Chen H. Tsai J.M. Hirth P. Gazit A. Levitzki A. McMahon G. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1998; 285: 844-852PubMed Google Scholar), and monensin, which blocks recycling of many receptors. This treatment led to the internalization of nonactivated PDGF-PDGFR complex into endosomes. The endosome-associated PDGFR was then activated by removing AG1296 and monensin. During this procedure we did not observe any detectable surface PDGFR phosphorylation. By using this system, we provided original evidence demonstrating that 1) endosomal activation of PDGFR recruits various signaling proteins including Grb2, SHC, PI3K, and PLC-γ1 into endosomes and forms signaling complexes with PDGFR; 2) endosomal PDGFR signaling is sufficient to activate the major signaling pathways implicated in cell proliferation and survival; and 3) endosomal PDGFR signaling is sufficient to generate physiological output including cell proliferation and cell survival. Antibodies and Chemicals—Mouse anti-phosphotyrosine (py99), anti-phospho-PLC-γ1 (Tyr783), rabbit anti-PDGFR, anti-phosphor-PDGFR, anti-ERK, anti-Grb2, anti-Raf, and anti-SHC antibodies were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Rabbit anti-p85 and mouse anti-Ras antibodies were from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. (Lake Placid, NY). Rabbit anti-phospho-Akt (Ser473) antibody was from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA). Glutathione cross-linked to 4% agarose was from Sigma. Protein A-Sepharose 6MB was from Amersham Biosciences. AG1296 and monensin were from Calbiochem (La Jolla, CA). PDGF-B was from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. Unless otherwise specified, all of the chemicals were purchased from Sigma. Cell Culture and Treatment—HepG cells (human hepatocellular carcinoma) stably transfected with PDGF-β receptor and F442 cells (mouse adipocytes) were grown at 37 °C in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum and were maintained in a 5% CO2 atmosphere. For HepG cells, 100 μm nonessential amino acids (Invitrogen) were added. To specifically activate PDGFR after its endocytosis into endosomes, HepG and F442 cells were serum-starved for 24 h. After the cells were pretreated with 0.05 μm AG1296 for 15 min, monensin and PDGF were added to final concentrations of 100 μm and 10 ng/ml, respectively. After a 30-min treatment, the cells were washed with PBS for three times and then maintained in the serum-free medium for the indicated time. U0126, an inhibitor of MEK activation, was added to the medium to a final concentration of 10 μm for 1 h. For the depletion of Raf, 10 μm Radicicol was added to the medium, and the cells were cultured for a further period of 40 h. To inhibit PI3K, 100 nm wortmannin was added to the medium for 30 min. Subcellular Fractionation and Total Cell Lysates—Isolation of plasma membrane, endosomal, and cytosolic fractions was carried out by our previously described method (51Wang Z. Zhang L. Yeung T.K. Chen X. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 1621-1636Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Briefly, following treatment the cells were scraped into homogenization buffer (0.25 m sucrose, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7, 1 mm MgCl2, 4 mm NaF, 0.5 mm Na3VO4, 0.02% NaN3, 0.1 mm 4-(2-aminoethyl)-benzenesulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μm pepstatin A) and homogenized. The homogenates were centrifuged at 200 × g for 5 min to remove cell debris and nuclei (p1). The post nuclear supernatant (S1) was then centrifuged at 1500 × g for 10 min to yield a supernatant (S2) and a pellet (P2). Next, P2 was resuspended in homogenization buffer (0.25 m sucrose), overlaid upon an equal volume of 1.42 m sucrose buffer, and centrifuged at 82,000 × g for 1 h. The pellicle at the 0.25–1.42 m interface was collected as the plasma membrane fraction. The S2 fraction was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 30 min to yield the soluble cytosolic fraction and a microsomal pellet. This pellet was resuspended in 0.25 m sucrose buffer and overlaid upon a discontinuous sucrose gradient containing equal volumes of homogenization buffer at 1.00 and 1.15 m sucrose. The resuspension was centrifuged at 200,000 × g for 1.5 h to obtain the purified endosomal fraction at the 0.25–1.00 m interface. Indirect Immunofluorescence—Indirect immunofluorescence was performed as described previously (51Wang Z. Zhang L. Yeung T.K. Chen X. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 1621-1636Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Briefly, the cells were grown on glass coverslips and serum-starved for 24 h. After treatment, the cells were fixed by ice-cold methanol and permeabilized with 0.02% Triton X-100. Next, the cells were incubated with indicated primary antibodies at room temperature for 1 h followed by fluorescence-labeled secondary antibodies for 1 h. Immunoprecipitation and Immunoblotting—Immunoprecipitation experiments were carried out as described previously (51Wang Z. Zhang L. Yeung T.K. Chen X. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 1621-1636Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). The cells were lysed with immunoprecipitation buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% sodium deoxycholate, 100 mm NaF, 0.5 mm Na3VO4, 0.02% NaN3, 0.1 mm 4-(2-aminoethyl)-benzenesulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μm pepstatin A) overnight at 4 °C. The cell lysates were then centrifuged at 21,000 × g for 30 min to remove debris. The supernatants, containing 1 mg of total protein, were used to incubate with 1 μg of rabbit anti-PDGFR antibody to immunoprecipitate PDGFR from HepG and F442 cells. Rabbit anti-SHC antibody was used to immunoprecipitate Shc because the size of Shc is similar to that of IgG. Ras Activation Assay—Ras activation was assayed by the method described by Herrmann et al. (52Herrmann C. Martin G.A. Wittinghofer A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2901-2905Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). Briefly, HepG or F442 cells that had been treated as required were lysed and scraped into 0.5 ml of BOS buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 200 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, 10 mm NaF, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA) and then centrifuged at 21,000 × g at 4 °C for 30 min. GST fusion Raf RBD domain (GST-RBD), precoupled to glutathione-agarose beads in BOS buffer, was added, and the lysates were incubated at 4 °C for 1 h. The beads were collected by centrifugation and washed three times with BOS buffer, and then loading buffer was added. Ras was detected using the monoclonal anti-Ras antibody, followed by horseradish peroxidase-coupled anti-mouse antibody. Anti-GST blot was used as a loading control. Immunoblotting—Immunoblotting was performed as described previously (53Wang Z. Moran M.F. Science. 1996; 272: 1935-1939Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). For the detection of PDGFR, phosphor-PDGFR, phospho-ERK, ERK, phospho-Akt, Akt, phospho-PLC-γ1, and PLC-γ1 in total lysates of HepG and F442 cells, aliquots containing 20 μg of protein from each cell lysate were used. For the detection of PDGFR, Grb2, PLC-γ1 and the p85α subunit of PI3K in the anti-PDGFR immunoprecipitates, PDGFR, and Shc in the anti-SHC immunoprecipitates, one-tenth of the immunoprecipitate from each lysate was used. To examine PDGFR in each subcellular fraction of HepG and F442 cells, aliquots containing 10% of the protein from each fraction were used. The protein samples were separated by electrophoresis through 10% polyacrylamide SDS-containing gels and electrophoretically transferred onto nitrocellulose filter paper. The filters were then probed with the respective primary antibody. The primary antibodies were detected with a polyclonal goat anti-rabbit IgG coupled to horseradish peroxidase or a polyclonal goat anti-mouse IgG coupled to horseradish peroxidase followed by enhanced chemiluminescence development (Pierce) and light detection with Fuji Super RX Film (Tokyo, Japan). Quantification of the results was achieved by using a FluorChem digital imaging system (Alpha Innotech Corporation). DNA Synthesis Assay—DNA synthesis was assayed by bromode-oxyuridine (BrdUrd) incorporation. The cells (HepG or F442) were plated at 10,000 cells/glass coverslip and serum-starved by incubation in serum-free medium for 24 h. The cells were then treated as necessary in the presence of 25 μm BrdUrd. For discontinuous treatment, BrdUrd was added back after each subsequent pulse or chase. After 16–18 h, the cells were washed and fixed. Following the denature of DNA with 2 n HCl for 30 min at room temperature, the cells were incubated with mouse anti-BrdUrd antibody for 1 h before addition of fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-mouse IgG for (for detection of BrdUrd) and 50 μg/ml propidium iodide (to stain for total DNA). The cell nuclei were visualized in the red and green channels, and digital images were quantitated for BrdUrd incorporation. The percentage of DNA synthesis was calculated as the number of BrdUrd positive cells/total number of cells analyzed × 100. For each experimental treatment, a minimum of 500 cells was counted. TUNEL Assay—HepG and F442 cells (10,000/coverslip) were serum-starved for 24 h to initiate a significant level of apoptosis. Some of the serum-starved cells were treated with AG1296 for 15 min and then with addition of PDGF (20 ng/ml) and monensin for 30 min followed by washing with PBS and incubation with serum-free medium for 12 h. For controls, some of the serum-starved cells were stimulated with PDGF for 30 min followed by incubation with serum-free medium for 12 h. Apoptosis was assayed by TUNEL assay using an apoptosis detection system kit (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The percentage of apoptotic cells was calculated as the number of apoptotic nuclei/total nuclei analyzed × 100. For each experimental treatment, a minimum of 250 cells was counted. Selective Activation of PDGFRs Following Their Endocytosis into Endosomes—We recently established a system to selectively activate endosomal EGFR without the activation of the plasma membrane-associated EGFR (25Wang Y. Pennock S. Chen X. Wang Z. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 7279-7290Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar, 39Wang Y. Pennock S. Chen X. Wang Z. Sci. STKE. 2002; 2002: L17Google Scholar). Here we apply the same approach to PDGFR. F442 cells and HepG cells that stably express human PDGFR were treated with AG1296 for 15 min and then stimulated with PDGF in the presence of monensin. After 30 min of incubation with PDGF and monensin, the majority of PDGFR was internalized into endosomes (Fig. 1). There is no overlap between PDGFR and Tyr(P) immunostains, indicating that the endosome-associated PDGFRs were not phosphorylated upon internalization (Fig. 1). For control cells treated only with PDGF, PDGFRs were phosphorylated and internalized into endosomes as expected. To more specifically determine the phosphorylation status of endosome-associated PDGFR, F442 and HepG cells were double stained with anti-PDGFR and anti-phospho-PDGFR (p-PDGFR) antibodies following the treatment described above. Our results confirmed that treatment of F442 and HepG cells with AG1296, PDGF, and monensin induced internalization of nonphosphorylated PDGFR into endosomes (Fig. 1). To determine whether endosome-associated nonphosphorylated PDGFR could be activated, F442 and HepG cells were washed with medium. The endosome-associated PDGFR was significantly activated 30 min following wash (Fig. 1). We did not observe any phosphorylation of plasma membrane-associated PDGFR (Fig. 1). These results suggest that we can specifically activate endosome-associated PDGFR. These observations were further confirmed by subcellular fractionation experiments (Fig. 2). It is well established that in the absence of ligand, PDGFR is localized on the plasma membrane where it is not phosphorylated; after induction by PDGF for 30 min, the vast majority of PDGFRs is phosphorylated and enriched in endosome fractions. PDGFR itself can therefore be used as a marker for plasma membrane and endosomes. Indeed, our results showed that, for both F442 and HepG cells, in the absence of PDGF PDGFR is primarily localized at the plasma membrane fraction and not phosphorylated, whereas PDGFR was primarily present in the endosome fraction and phosphorylated following standard PDGF stimulation (Fig. 2). Additionally, early endosome autoantigen 1, a marker for endosomes, is highly enriched in our endosome fractions. Treatment with AG1296, monensin, and PDGF resulted in the internalization of nonphosphorylated PDGFR into endosomes, and the endosome-associated PDGFR was phosphorylated following washing and incubation in medium (Fig. 2). Washing to remove AG1296 and monensin did not result in the increase of plasma membrane-associated PDGFR (Fig. 2), which suggests there is no detectable recycling of PDGFR to the plasma membrane following the removal of monensin. More importantly, only very little phosphorylated PDGFR was detected at the plasma membrane (Fig. 2). Together, these results suggest that we have established a system to specifically activate PDGFR in endosomes without meaningful PDGFR activation at the plasma membrane. The Level and Duration of PDGFR Activation in Our Established System—We next determined the level and duration of PDGFR activity in our system. HepG and F442 cells were treated with AG1296, PDGF, and monensin as described above. Immunoblotting with anti-PDGFR and anti-p-PDGFR antibodies showed that before washing, no PDGFR was phosphorylated (Fig. 3). Washing and incubation gradually induced the phosphorylation of PDGFR. After washing for 30 min, phosphorylation of PDGFR reached the maximum that is 50% of the level following standard PDGF stimulation for 30 min. After washing for 2 h, the level of phosphorylated PDGFR was undetectable (Fig. 3). This pattern of receptor dephosphorylation is similar to that following standard PDGF stimulation (data not shown). Recruitment of Signaling Proteins into Endosomes by Activation of Endosome-associated PDGFR—We next used this system to specifically study PDGFR-mediated signal transduction from endosomes. First we examined whether activation of endosome-associated PDGFR is able to interact with various signaling proteins and form the signaling complex in endosomes. HepG and F442 cells were treated with AG1296 and then PDGF and monensin as described above. The cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-PDGFR antibody, and the immunoprecipitates were immunoblotted with antibodies to various signaling proteins. As shown in Fig. 4, specific activation of endosome-associated PDGFR resulted in the association of PDGFR with Grb2, PLC-γ1, and the p85α subunit of PI3K. However, we cannot clearly show the SHC bands in the immunoblot. This may be partially due to the similar molecular weight between IgG and SHC and partially due to the poor co-immunoprecipitation or SHC by anti-PDGFR antibody. To further test the interaction between SHC and PDGFR, we immunoprecipitated the total lysates with anti-SHC antibody. Immunoblotting the immunoprecipitates with anti-PDGFR antibody showed the association between PDGFR and SHC following the specific activation of endosome-associated PDGFR (Fig. 4B). The above results indicate that direct activation of endosome-associated PDGFR is sufficient to recruit the major signaling proteins to endosomes to form the signaling complexes with PDGFR. Stimulation of Various Signaling"
https://openalex.org/W2091358183,"MTM1, the gene encoding myotubularin (MTM1), is mutated in the X-linked myotubular myopathy (XLMTM), a severe genetic muscular disorder. MTM1 is a phosphoinositide phosphatase hydrolyzing phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate (PtdIns(3)P) in yeast and in vitro. Because this lipid is implicated in the regulation of vesicular trafficking, we used established cell lines from XLMTM patients to evaluate whether the lack of endogenous MTM1 expression could affect PtdIns(3)P labeling patterns. Our results showed that the vesicular trafficking related to early endosomes was not significantly affected in the XLMTM cell lines compared with control cells. However, in addition to PtdIns(3)P, we found that MTM1 can hydrolyze phosphatidylinositol 3,5-bisphosphate both in vitro and in mammalian cells. Using a mass assay, we demonstrated that the product generated is phosphatidylinositol 5-phosphate (PtdIns(5)P), a recently discovered phosphoinositide, the function of which is still unknown. In L6 myotubes overexpressing MTM1, hyperosmotic shock induced an increase in the mass level of PtdIns(5)P that was reduced by 50% upon overexpression of the MTM1 inactive mutant D278A. These data demonstrate for the first time a role for MTM1 in the production of PtdIns(5)P in mammalian cells, suggesting that the lack of transformation of phosphatidylinositol 3,5-bisphosphate into PtdIns(5)P might be an important component in the etiology of myotubular myopathy.

The disease, which affects 1 of 50,000 newborn males, is characterized by muscle weakness and hypotonia at birth. In the most severe cases, it leads to the death in the first weeks of life because of respiratory failure. More than 198 different mutations have been found in the MTM1 gene, mainly leading to the absence or the expression of a truncated version of the protein (1Biancalana V. Caron O. Gallati S. Baas F. Kress W. Novelli G. D'Apice M.R. Lagier-Tourenne C. Buj-Bello A. Romero N.B. Mandel J.-L. Hum. Genet. 2003; 112: 135-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). The gene encoding MTM1 was cloned in 1996 (2Laporte J. Hu L.J. Kretz C. Mandel J.-L. Kioschis P. Coy J.F. Klauck S.M. Poustka A. Dahl N. Nat. Genet. 1996; 13: 175-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar), and its sequence shows the presence of the HCSDGWDRT motif, which fits the conserved consensus sequence CX5R of the dual specificity phosphatase/phosphotyrosine phosphatase (DSP/PTP) family. However, studies on MTM1 activity showed that its preferred substrate is not a tyrosine-phosphorylated protein but the phosphoinositide PtdIns(3)P (3Blondeau F. Laporte J. Bodin S. Superti-Furga G. Payrastre B. Mandel J.-L. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2000; 9: 2223-2229Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar, 4Taylor G.S. Maehama T. Dixon J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 8910-8915Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar), thereby identifying MTM1 as a lipid phosphatase. Thus, MTM1 is a 3-phosphatase but exhibits a different substrate specificity compared with the tumor suppressor PTEN that hydrolyzes preferentially PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 (5Maehama T. Dixon J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13375-13378Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2552) Google Scholar). MTM1 could therefore act as a regulator of the highly active phosphoinositide (PI) metabolism in cells (6Tronchère H. Buj-Bello A. Mandel J.-L. Payrastre B. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2003; 60: 2084-2099Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), where interconversions of the eight PIs described so far is controlled by a set of specific kinases and phosphatases (7Payrastre B. Missy K. Giuriato S. Bodin S. Plantavid M. Gratacap M. Cell. Signal. 2001; 13: 377-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). PIs are minor phospholipids of the cell membrane; however, they play a major role of second messengers in diverse cellular functions such as proliferation, apoptosis, cytoskeletal remodeling, and vesicular trafficking (7Payrastre B. Missy K. Giuriato S. Bodin S. Plantavid M. Gratacap M. Cell. Signal. 2001; 13: 377-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar, 8Toker A. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2002; 59: 761-779Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). The way PIs act is via targeting of proteins to specific membrane locations by binding to specific protein domains such as the pleckstrin homology, phox, Fab1p/YOTB/Vac1p/EEA1 (FYVE), epsin N-terminal homology, and band 4.1/ezrin/radixin/moesin domains. MTM1 is highly conserved during evolution and is the founding member of the myotubularin-related proteins (MTMRs) family, which today counts 14 members. In addition to MTM1, other members of the family are linked to genetic diseases. MTMR1 is a target for aberrant splicing in the congenital myotonic dystrophy, cDM1 (9Buj-Bello A. Furling D. Tronchère H. Laporte J. Lerouge T. Buttler-Browne G.S. Mandel J.-L. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2002; 11: 2297-2307Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), and mutations in MTMR2 have been associated to the Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 4B1 (CMT4B1), a demyelinating neuropathy (10Bolino A. Muglia M. Conforti F.L. LeGuern E. Salih M.A. Georgiou D.M. Christodoulou K. Hausmanowa-Petrusewicz I. Mandich P. Schenone A. Gambardella A. Bono F. Quattrone A. Devoto M. Monaco A.P. Nat. Genet. 2000; 25: 17-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar). Two members of the phosphatase-dead MTMR subgroup have also been implicated in defects or disease, respectively. MTMR5/SBF1 was shown to play a role in spermatogenesis in mice (11Firestein R. Nagy P.L. Daly M. Huie P. Conti M. Cleary M.L. J. Clin. Investig. 2002; 109: 1165-1172Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), and MTMR13/SBF2 was recently found mutated in the CMT4B2, another type of Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (12Senderek J. Bergmann C. Weber S. Ketelsen U.-P. Schorle H. Rudnik-Schöneborn S. Buttner R. Buchheim E. Zerres K. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2003; 12: 349-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar, 13Azzedine H.

Genet. 2003; 72: 1141-1153Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). Thus, although the cellular function of the MTM family members appears essential, it still remains elusive. Recent studies (14Buj-Bello A. Laugel V. Messaddeq N. Zahreddine H. Laporte J. Pellissier J.F. Mandel J.-L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 15060-15065Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar) on the knock-out MTM1 mice proposed a role for the phosphatase in the maintenance of muscle fiber state rather than in myogenesis to explain the physiopathological mechanism of the XLMTM. As a 3-phosphatase hydrolyzing PtdIns(3)P, MTM1 was proposed to play a regulatory role in vesicular trafficking, and in some cases, overexpression of the phosphatase indeed leads to the disappearance of PtdIns(3)P endosomal punctate labeling (15Kim S.-A. Taylor G.S. Torgersen K.M. Dixon J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 4526-4531Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). However, more studies are necessary to definitely link MTM1 to a physiological role in vesicular trafficking. To address this point, we investigated whether endogenous MTM1 could affect the pool of PtdIns(3)P in early endosomes by studying established cell lines from patients suffering from myotubular myopathy. Surprisingly, our results show that in the XLMTM cell lines, EEA1, a marker for early endosome, and PtdIns(3)P labeling patterns are not significantly affected compared with normal cell lines. Therefore, we then further investigated MTM1 cellular function and specificity toward other PIs. It has been shown recently that two members of the MTM family, namely MTMR3 overexpressed in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae and the mouse MTMR2 in an in vitro assay, can use PtdIns(3,5)P2 as a substrate in addition to PtdIns(3)P, leading to the production of PtdIns(5)P (16Walker D.M.

Suter U. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2002; 11: 1569-1579Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar), a newly described PI (18Rameh L.E. Tolias K.F. Duckworth B.C. Cantley L.C. Nature. 1997; 390: 192-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar). Here we show that both MTM1 and MTMR1 are also able to hydrolyze PtdIns(3,5)P2 in vitro, in addition to PtdIns(3)P. Moreover, we demonstrate that MTM1 is a source of PtdIns(5)P in vitro and in vivo, pointing to a role for the phosphatase in the production of this recently described PI in mammalian cells. Altogether, our data suggest that MTM1 could affect a minor pool of PtdIns(3)P and that the production of PtdIns(5)P, through its action as a PtdIns(3,5)P2 phosphatase, might be essential to its cellular function. Cloning, Antibodies, and Proteins Expressions—FLAG-MTM1 construct was obtained by PCR amplification of human MTM1 cDNA and subcloned into a pcDNA3-modified vector with an N-terminal FLAG tag. All the other constructs were already described (9Buj-Bello A. Furling D. Tronchère H. Laporte J. Lerouge T. Buttler-Browne G.S. Mandel J.-L. Hum. Mol.

Commun. 2002; 291: 305-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The 1G6 monoclonal antibody was raised against an N-terminal peptide (amino acids 13-32) of human MTM1 (20Laporte J. Blondeau F. Gansmuller A. Lutz Y. Vonesch J.L. Mandel J.-L. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 3105-3117Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and the EEA1 mouse antibody (clone 14) was purchased from BD Biosciences. The cDNA for the GST-2XFYVE probe interacting with PtdIns(3)P was a gift of Dr. H. Stenmark, Institute for Cancer Research, Oslo, Norway (21Gillooly D.J. Morrow I.C. Lindsay M. Gould R. Bryant N.J. Gaullier J.M. Parton R.G. Stenmark H. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 4577-4588Crossref PubMed Scopus (837) Google Scholar). The recombinant GST-2XFYVE protein was expressed in DH5α Escherichia coli strain, bound to a glutathione-agarose affinity column and eluted in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, with 25 mm reduced glutathione. The GST-2XFYVE fusion protein was then biotinylated using the biotin tag micro-biotinylation kit (Sigma) following the manufacturer's conditions, and the unreacted biotin was removed with Centricon YM10 (Millipore, Bedford, MA). PGEX-PtdIns(5)P 4-kinase type IIα was provided by Dr. N. Divecha (The Netherlands Cancer Institute, Amsterdam, The Netherlands). The recombinant GST-PtdIns(5)P 4-kinase type IIα was expressed in the BL21-CodonPlus E. coli strain (Stratagene) and purified on glutathione-agarose beads (Amersham Biosciences). Recombinant adenoviral genomes carrying the wild type human hMTM1 or the substrate trap hMTM1-D278A cDNAs were generated by homologous recombination as described in Chaussade et al. (22Chaussade C. Pirola L. Bonnafous S. Blondeau F. Brenz-Verca S. Tronchère H. Portis F. Rusconi S. Payrastre B. Laporte J. Van Obberghen E. Mol. Endocrinol. 2003; 17: 2448-2460Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Cell Culture, Transfections, and Viral Infections—COS-7, HEK293, and L6 myoblasts cells were maintained at 37 °C with 5% (v/v) CO2 in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) containing 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (Invitrogen). L6 differentiation to myotubes was induced by culturing cells for over 5 days in DMEM containing 2% (v/v) fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin before adenovirus infection. Adenoviruses were stored in PBS, 10% (v/v) glycerol at -20 °C, and viral titer of stocks was >108 plaque-forming units/ml. Infections of the L6 myotubes were performed at a multiplicity of infection of 10. After 16-20 h of incubation in the presence of viral particles, the medium was changed, and cells were cultured for 24-72 h. Hyperosmotic shock was performed by incubating the cells in medium containing 0.9 m NaCl for 10 min at 37 °C. For transfection experiments, COS-7 or HEK293 cells were seeded in 6-well plates and were transfected using Effectene (Qiagen) with 0.3 μg of plasmid DNA according to the manufacturer's instructions. 24 h after transfection, cells were washed once in PBS and used for immunoprecipitation experiments. Jurkat cells were cultivated in RPMI plus 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum and transferred into 12-well plates after nucleofection of 1 μg of plasmid DNA/106 cells using AMAXA nucleofector kit V (Amaxa Biosystems). 24 h after nucleofection, cells were washed once in PBS and used for PtdIns(5)P mass measurement assay. Established cell lines from XLMTM patients were already described elsewhere (23Laporte J. Kress W. Mandel J.-L. Ann. Neurol. 2001; 50: 42-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) and were provided by O. Bartsch (H31), W. Kress (G95-320), H. Moirot (CQ85), O. Dorchies (MHN), E. Janssen (NL15), L. Bason (EG84), and N. Piquion (DM92). In Vitro Phosphatase Activity—Cells were lysed in buffer A (20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 4 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100 plus protease inhibitor mixture). Lysates were incubated with anti-FLAG M2 antibody (Sigma) or 1G6 MTM1-specific antibody plus protein A-coated agarose beads (Amersham Biosciences) for 3 h at 4 °C. The immunocomplex was washed several times in buffer A and then in 50 mm ammonium acetate, pH 6.0, and assayed for phosphatase activity in 50 mm ammonium acetate plus 2 mm DTT, pH 6.0, with either di-C8-NBD or di-C16-NBD fluorescent phosphoinositides (Echelon Research Laboratories) according to Taylor and Dixon (24Taylor G.S. Dixon J.E. Anal. Biochem. 2001; 295: 122-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Lipids were extracted according to Blight and Dyer (25Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-918Crossref PubMed Scopus (41848) Google Scholar) with addition of HCl to a final concentration of 0.4 n, separated on Silica Gel G60 TLC, and visualized under UV light. Phosphatase activity was also quantified by release of free phosphate using the Biomol Green (Biomol, Plymouth Meeting, PA) malachite green binding assay adapted for 96 wells according to the manufacturer's protocol. PtdIns(5)P Mass Measurement—Total lipids were extracted according to Blight and Dyer (25Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-918Crossref PubMed Scopus (41848) Google Scholar) in the presence of HCl to a final concentration of 0.4 n and separated on Silica gel G60 TLC plate in the CH3Cl/CH3OH/NH3 (9:7:2) solvent system. Monophosphorylated PIs were scraped, eluted from the silica, and assayed for PtdIns(4,5)P2 formation in vitro using the recombinant-specific PtdIns(5)P 4-kinase type IIα and [γ-32P]ATP as described by Morris et al. (26Morris J.B. Hinchliffe K.A. Ciruela A. Letcher A.J. Irvine R.F. FEBS Lett. 2000; 475: 57-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Generated [γ-32P]PtdIns(4,5)P2 was separated by TLC and detected by a PhosphorImager system, and the associated radioactivity was counted with a β scintillation counter. Quantification of the mass amount of generated PtdIns(5)P was performed as published previously (26Morris J.B. Hinchliffe K.A. Ciruela A. Letcher A.J. Irvine R.F. FEBS Lett. 2000; 475: 57-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 27Niebuhr K. Giuriato S. Pedron T. Philpott D.J. Gaits F. Sable J. Sheetz M.P. Parsot C. Sansonetti P.J. Payrastre B.

Phosphoinositides Analysis—L6 differentiated myotubes were incubated overnight with 1 μCi of [32P]orthophosphate in phosphate-free DMEM. Lipids were extracted according to Blight and Dyer (25Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-918Crossref PubMed Scopus (41848) Google Scholar) with addition of 0.4 n HCl (final concentration) and resolved on Silica G60 TLC in CH3Cl/CH3COCH3/CH3OH/CH3COOH/H2O (80:30:26:24:14, v/v). The relevant lipids were scraped off, deacylated, and analyzed by HPLC on a Partisphere 5 SAX column (Whatman) and quantified on a continuous flow in-line scintillation detector (Beckman Instruments) as described previously (7Payrastre B. Missy K. Giuriato S. Bodin S. Plantavid M. Gratacap M. Cell. Signal. 2001; 13: 377-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar, 27Niebuhr K. Giuriato S. Pedron T. Philpott D.J. Gaits F. Sable J. Sheetz M.P. Parsot C. Sansonetti P.J. Payrastre B. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 5069-5078Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). The elution positions were determined by using appropriate standards. Immunofluorescence Microscopy—Fibroblasts and myoblasts were grown on glass coverslips in DMEM + 10% fetal calf serum and minimum Eagle's medium + 25% 199 medium + 20% fetal calf serum, respectively. The protocol used for biotinylated GST-2XFYVE as a probe for PtdIns(3)P is a modification of the original protocol described by Gillooly et al. (21Gillooly D.J. Morrow I.C. Lindsay M. Gould R. Bryant N.J. Gaullier J.M. Parton R.G. Stenmark H. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 4577-4588Crossref PubMed Scopus (837) Google Scholar) that was described in Kim et al. (15Kim S.-A. Taylor G.S. Torgersen K.M. Dixon J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 4526-4531Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Briefly, after washing in PBS, cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde overnight at 4 °C, which permeabilizes most of the cells. All incubations and washes were then done in PBS at room temperature. The cells were washed and the free aldehyde groups were quenched for 15 min with 50 mm NH4Cl, and fixed cells were blocked in PBS + 5% bovine serum albumin for an hour. Cover glasses were then incubated with mouse anti-EEA1 antibody (1:100) and biotinylated GST-2XFYVE recombinant protein (40 μg/ml) for 1 h. After washing, coverslips were incubated for 1 h with Alexa fluor 488 goat anti-mouse and Alexa fluor 594 streptavidin (Molecular Probes). The slides were washed three times and mounted in anti-fading solution (5% propyl galate and 80% glycerol in PBS), and the signals were analyzed by fluorescence microscopy. Localization of PtdIns(3)P and EEA1 in Cell Lines from XLMTM Patients—We and others have shown previously that MTM1 hydrolyzes PtdIns(3)P in vitro and in yeast (3Blondeau F. Laporte J. Bodin S. Superti-Furga G. Payrastre B. Mandel J.-L. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2000; 9: 2223-2229Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar, 4Taylor G.S. Maehama T. Dixon J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 8910-8915Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar) and that its activity is specific for the 3-O-phosphate position of monophosphoinositides in vitro (19Laporte J. Liaubet L. Blondeau F. Tronchère H. Mandel J.L. Payrastre B. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 291: 305-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). PtdIns(3)P was implicated in intravesicular trafficking regulation in yeast and in mammalian cells (21Gillooly D.J. Morrow I.C. Lindsay M. Gould R. Bryant N.J. Gaullier J.M. Parton R.G. Stenmark H. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 4577-4588Crossref PubMed Scopus (837) Google Scholar). Therefore, we addressed the physiological role of MTM1 in the regulation of the PtdIns(3)P levels by comparing its localization in normal and XLMTM patients cell lines. In the control cell line, there is a good colocalization of PtdIns(3)P detected by the biotinylated 2X-FYVE probe, with one of its target, the early endosome marker EEA1, labeled by a specific antibody (Fig. 1, A-C). A similar PtdIns(3)P labeling pattern was observed in the H31 fibroblasts cell line deleted for the entire MTM1 gene, as well as in fibroblasts cell lines G95-320 and CQ85 established from two patients affected during infancy by a myopathy resembling XLMTM but with no mutations in the MTM1 gene and by a centronuclear myopathy, respectively. Centronuclear myopathies are histopathologically related myopathies with a later onset and an autosomal inheritance. In the 3 cell lines expressing normal levels of MTM1 (control, G95-320, and CQ85) and in the MTM1-deleted cell line H31 (23Laporte J. Kress W. Mandel J.-L. Ann. Neurol. 2001; 50: 42-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), there is no modification of PtdIns(3)P labeling pattern (Fig. 1, A, D, G, and J), which still largely colocalizes with the EEA1 marker (Fig. 1, C, F, I, and L). We also monitored PtdIns(3)P pools in established myoblasts cell lines from XLMTM patients (Fig. 2), a cell system more relevant to the severe muscular phenotype usually observed in XLMTM patients. In those cell lines, a decrease in MTM1 level compared with normal myoblasts (23Laporte J. Kress W. Mandel J.-L. Ann. Neurol. 2001; 50: 42-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), and two of them were derived from patients presenting severe phenotypes (EG84 and DM92), has been observed by immunoprecipitation using the 1G6 antibody. Our results show the colocalization of PtdIns(3)P with the EEA1 marker in the 3 myoblast cell lines from XLMTM patients (Fig. 2, F, I, and L) and the control myoblasts (Fig. 2C). As a control, Fig. 2, M-O, shows the delocalization of PtdIns(3)P by wortmannin treatment in normal myoblasts. Altogether, these data suggest that the lack of expression of endogenous MTM1 in fibroblasts or myoblasts does not significantly affect the pool of PtdIns(3)P on EEA1-decorated membranes.Fig. 2EEA1 and PtdIns(3)P colocalization in human normal and XLMTM myoblasts. Normal human myoblasts and myoblasts from patients were grown on coverslips and treated for immunofluorescence studies as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The cell lines used are as follows: normal human myoblasts (A-C); XLMTM patients: NL15, missense mutation R241C (D-F); EG84, truncating mutation, frameshift after amino acid 238 (G-I); DM92: truncating mutation, R474X (J-L). PtdIns(3)P is detected with the biotinylated 2X-FYVE probe (A, D, G, J, and M) and endogenous EEA1 with an anti-EEA1 antibody (B, E, H, K, and N). In the merge images (C, F, I, L, and O), the yellow color indicates colocalization of the 2X-FYVE probe with the early endosome marker. Normal muscle cells were treated with 500 nm wortmannin for 30 min (M-O). In the merge images (C, F, I, L, and O), the yellow color indicates colocalization of the 2X-FYVE probe with the early endosome marker.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) MTM1 Is a PtdIns(3)P and PtdIns(3,5)P2 3-Phosphatase in Vitro—The observations from XLMTM patient cell lines suggested that endogenous MTM1 may act on a discrete pool of PtdIns(3)P. This seems reasonable because the decrease in PtdIns(3)P levels upon MTM1 overexpression never exceeded more than 10-15% 2B. Payrastre and H. Tronchère, unpublished observations. in the different cell lines that we have tested (COS-7, HEK 293, L6, C2C12, and Jurkat). This value is in agreement with the results reported by Taylor et al. (4Taylor G.S. Maehama T. Dixon J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 8910-8915Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar) and suggests other possible functions for MTM1. As shown recently that MTMR2 and the mouse homologue of MTMR3 can also hydrolyze PtdIns(3,5)P2, we addressed this possibility for MTM1. We thus proceeded with the in vitro characterization of MTM1 phosphatase lipid substrate specificity using short side acyl chains (C6), fluorescent PIs, and immunoprecipitated MTM1 (or its close homologue MTMR1) overexpressed in mammalian cells. In addition, human MTMR2 and MTMR3 were used as controls. Fig. 3A shows that all four MTM family members can use PtdIns(3,5)P2 as a substrate, in addition to PtdIns(3)P. None of the 5 other PIs tested are substrates for the phosphatases. MTM1 and MTMR1 seem as potent as MTMR2 and MTMR3 to hydrolyze PtdIns(3,5)P2 and PtdIns(3)P, leading to the complete hydrolysis of the substrates after 30 min of incubation at 30 °C (Fig. 3A). In order to show that the 3-phosphatase activity of MTM1 measured in vitro is specific, we used a phosphatase-inactive MTM1 mutant, where the cysteine residue in the phosphatase catalytic center has been mutated into serine (C375S). Fig. 3B shows that the hydrolysis of PtdIns(3)P and PtdIns(3,5)P2 is specific for MTM1 intrinsic phosphatase activity. We next measured the hydrolysis efficiency in function of fluorescent lipid concentration in the in vitro phosphatase assay using MTM1 and MTMR2. We show that the phosphatase reaction reached saturation at 1 μg of fluorescent PtdIns(3)P or PtdIns(3,5)P2 in 8 min at 30 °C for both MTM1 and MTMR2 (Fig. 3C). Because naturally occurring PIs in cell membranes are long acyl chains species, the use of C6 side chains PIs in our assays might be of concern. To clarify this point, we performed in vitro experiments using C16-PIs. The results presented in Fig. 4A show that the specificity of MTM1 is kept independently of the acyl chain length. Moreover, by using a malachite green assay to quantify the amount of free phosphate released during MTM1 assay, we found that both C16-PtdIns(3)P and C16-PtdIns(3,5)P2 were hydrolyzed in a comparable manner (Fig. 4B). MTM1 Produces PtdIns(5)P in Vitro—We next checked whether dephosphorylation of PtdIns(3,5)P2 by MTM1 and family members generates PtdIns(5)P. We took advantage of the use of the PtdIns(5)P 4-kinase type IIα, which phosphorylates PtdIns(5)P on position 4 of the inositol ring, to produce PtdIns(4,5)P2 (26Morris J.B. Hinchliffe K.A. Ciruela A. Letcher A.J. Irvine R.F. FEBS Lett. 2000; 475: 57-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). First, the specific substrate selectivity of PtdIns(5)P 4-kinase type IIα toward PtdIns(5)P was verified by using other possible substrates like PtdIns(3)P and PtdIns(4)P. Fig. 5A demonstrates the strong specificity of the kinase for PtdIns(5)P. The PtdInsP2 formed in this reaction was identified as being exclusively PtdIns(4,5)P2 by HPLC analysis (data not shown). MTM1, MTMR2, and MTMR3 immunoprecipitated from overexpressed COS-7 cells where first tested for their 3-phosphatase activity by using C16-NBD-PtdIns(3,5)P2 (Fig. 5B). The PtdInsPs generated were scraped off, recovered from silica, and used as substrate for the recombinant PtdIns(5)P 4-kinase type IIα in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP. Fig. 5B shows that the product generated by MTM1 and MTMRs from PtdIns(3,5)P2 is indeed PtdIns(5)P, as reflected by the generation of [γ-32P]PtdIns(4,5)P2 in the kinase assay. Overall, these results demonstrate that MTM1 overexpressed in mammalian cells can transform PtdIns(3,5)P2 into PtdIns(5)P when tested in vitro. MTM1 Produces PtdIns(5)P in Vivo—We then checked whether MTM1 could increase PtdIns(5)P mass levels in vivo when expressed in mammalian cells. Jurkat cells were used because they have a relatively high basal amount of PtdIns(3,5)P2. 3B. Payrastre, u"
https://openalex.org/W2048245383,"Queuosine (Q) is a hypermodified 7-deazaguanosine nucleoside located in the anticodon wobble position of four amino acid-specific tRNAs. In bacteria, Q is produced de novo from GTP via the 7-deazaguanosine precursor preQ1 (7-aminoethyl 7-deazaguanine) by an uncharacterized pathway. PreQ1 is subsequently transferred to its specific tRNA by a tRNA-guanine transglycosylase (TGT) and then further modified in situ to produce Q. Here we use comparative genomics to implicate four gene families (best exemplified by the B. subtilis operon ykvJKLM) as candidates in the preQ1 biosynthetic pathway. Deletions were constructed in genes for each of the four orthologs in Acinetobacter. High pressure liquid chromatography analysis showed the Q nucleoside was absent from the tRNAs of each of four deletion strains. Electrospray ionization mass spectrometry confirmed the absence of Q in each mutant strain. Finally, introduction of the Bacillus subtilis ykvJKLM operon in trans complemented the Q deficiency of the two deletion mutants that were tested. Thus, the products of these four genes (named queC, -D, -E, and -F) are essential for the Q biosynthetic pathway.

Nucleoside modification typically occurs in ∼10% of the nucleosides of a particular tRNA but can involve as many as 25% of the nucleosides for a specific tRNA (1Björk G.R. RajBhandary U.L. tRNA: Structure, Biosynthesis, and Function. ASM Press, Washington, D. C.1995: 165-206Google Scholar). Over 80 modified nucleosides have been characterized (1Björk G.R. RajBhandary U.L. tRNA: Structure, Biosynthesis, and Function. ASM Press, Washington, D. C.1995: 165-206Google Scholar), many of which are phylogenetically conserved. The nature of nucleoside modification varies from simple methylation of the base or ribose ring to extensive “hypermodification” of the canonical bases. The latter involves multiple enzymatic steps and can result in substantive structural changes (2Garcia G.A. Goodenough-Lashua D.M. Benne R. Modification and Editing of RNA. ASM Press, Washington, D. C.1998Google Scholar). Queuosine (Q) 1The abbreviations used are: Q, queuosine; preQ0, 7-cyano-7-deazaguanosine; preQ1, 7-aminoethyl 7-deazaguanine; TGT, tRNA-guanine transglycosylase; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography; ESIMS, electrospray ionization mass spectrometry; COG, clusters of orthologous groups. is an example of a highly modified nucleoside located in the anticodon wobble position 34 of tRNAs specific for Tyr, His, Asp, and Asn (3Harada F. Nishimura S. Biochemistry. 1972; 11: 301-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). With few exceptions (such as yeast and mycoplasma), it is widely distributed in most prokaryotic and eukaryotic phyla (4Katze J.R. Basile B. McCloskey J.A. Science. 1982; 216: 55-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Q is based on a very unusual 7-deazaguanosine core, which is further modified by addition of a cyclopentendiol ring (5Kasai H. Oashi Z. Harada F. Nishimura S. Oppenheimer N.J. Biochemistry. 1975; 14: 4198-4208Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar, 6Yokoyama S. Miyazawa T. Iitaka Y. Yamaizumi Z. Kasai H. Nishimura S. Nature. 1979; 282: 107-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The Q modification has long been known and has been implicated in a number of disparate physiological phenomena, such as eukaryotic cell proliferation and differentiation (7Kersten H. Kersten W. Kuo K.C.T. Chromatography and Modification of Nucleosides, Part B. Elsevier, Amsterdam, The Netherlands1990: 69-108Google Scholar, 8Okada N. Shindo-Okada N. Sato S. Itoh Y.H. Oda K. Nishimura S.

Sasakawa C. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 4627-4634Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, despite the presence of Q in the tRNA anticodon loop, no definitive role for Q in translation has been established (13Morris R.C. Elliott M.S. Mol. Genet. Metab. 2001; 74: 147-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Unlike eukaryotes that import the queuine base, bacteria synthesize Q modification de novo from a GTP starting block (14Kuchino Y. Kasai H. Nihei K. Nishimura S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1976; 3: 393-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The first stage of synthesis gives 7-cyano-7-deazaguanosine (preQ0) that is then further modified into 7-aminoethyl 7-deazaguanine (preQ1) (Fig. 1). The preQ1 base is subsequently transferred to the appropriate tRNA in a guanine-exchange reaction catalyzed by a tRNA-guanine transglycosylase (TGT) (15Okada N. Noguchi S. Kasai H. Shindo-Okada N. Ohgi T. Goto T. Nishimura S. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 3067-3073Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It is then further modified in situ to give Q (16Reuter K. Slany R. Ulrich F. Kersten H. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 2256-2264Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A second 7-deazaguanosine tRNA modification, archaeosine, is found in all archaeal tRNAs at position 15 of the d-loop (17Edmonds C.G. Crain P.F. Gupta R. Hashizume T. Hocart C.H. Kowalak J.A. Pomerantz S.C. Stetter K.O. McCloskey J.A. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 3138-3148Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Archaeosine is also synthesized via preQ0, the substrate for the archaea, TGT enzyme (18Watanabe M. Matsuo M. Tanaka S. Akimoto H. Asahi S. Nishimura S. Katze J.R. Hashizume T. Crain P.F. McCloskey J.A. Okada N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20146-20151Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Although the TGT-dependent guanine exchange reactions are well characterized for both Q and archaeosine biosynthesis, little is known about the enzymes and intermediates involved in carbon atom replacement of N-7 of the purine ring to produce 7-deazaguanosine bases preQ0 and preQ1. Elucidation of genes involved in 7-deazaguanosine biosynthesis could potentially lead to the discovery of novel metabolites and enzyme activities. We report here the identification of four new genes involved in the biosynthesis of the 7-deazaguanosine bases in bacteria. No definitive phenotype or genetic selection exists for the Q modification. Therefore, comparative genomics was used to identify candidate genes. Three criteria were used: phylogenetic distribution of tRNA modification activities, clustering of tRNA modification genes, and prediction of catalytic mechanism. This approach has been successful in finding other tRNA modification genes such as those encoding the tRNA dihydrouridine synthase that produces 5,6-dihydrouridine (19Bishop A.C. Xu J. Johnson R.C. Schimmel P. de Crecy-Lagard V. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 25090-25095Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Once promising gene candidates had been identified, we took advantage of an efficient gene deletion strategy that makes use of the competence properties of Acinetobacter calcoaceticus. 2D. Metzgar, V. Pezo, J. Reader, V. Döring, P. Schimmel, P. Marlière, and V. de Crécy-Lagard, manuscript in preparation. This organism is naturally competent and is efficient at homologous recombination (20Kok R.G. D'Argenio D.A. Ornston L.N. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 4270-4276Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 21Young D.M. Kok R.G. Ornston L.N. Methods Mol. Biol. 2002; 182: 103-115PubMed Google Scholar), thus allowing rapid construction of mutant alleles. The candidate 7-deazaguanine biosynthesis genes were independently deleted from the Acinetobacter genome, and the bulk tRNA extracted from these deletion strains was examined for the loss of Q. Two of the deletion mutants were then tested for complementation of Q deficiency by the introduction of the orthologous B. subtilis ykvJKLM operon. Strains and Growth Conditions—All genetic manipulations of Acinetobacter strains were performed at 30 °C in LB liquid media or on LB-agar plates supplemented, when appropriate, with 25 μg/ml kanamycin. Growth of constructed bacterial strains for bulk tRNA purification was performed at 37 °C in LB liquid media with 50 μg/ml kanamycin. Strain Construction—Table I lists all mutant strains made in this study. To generate chromosomal gene deletions in the wild-type Acinetobacter strain ADP1 (22Juni E. Janik A. J. Bacteriol. 1969; 98: 281-288Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), a positive/negative selection cassette was constructed as described elsewhere in detail.2 (Methods and tools are available upon request from [email protected]). DNA fragments encoding the ykvJKLM homologs in Acinetobacter were identified by BLAST (23Madden T.L. Tatusov R.L. Zhang J. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 266: 131-141Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and used to design primers (see Supplemental Material, Table II) that allowed the precise replacement of the four open reading frames by either a Km/tdk or a Km/SacB cassette. For each mutant, three independent PCR fragments were amplified and spliced together: one covered a 1000-base region upstream of the target gene, one covered the selective marker cassette, and one covered a 1000-base region downstream of the target gene. The PCR oligonucleotides were designed so that the three fragments could be spliced together (24Murphy K.C. Campellone K.G. Poteete A.R. Gene. 2000; 246: 321-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar) in a PCR. The DNA product of this PCR was used directly to transform Acinetobacter by recombination (21Young D.M. Kok R.G. Ornston L.N. Methods Mol. Biol. 2002; 182: 103-115PubMed Google Scholar). All potential recombinant deletion mutants were screened by PCR (using the outside flanking primers) to generate the correctly sized recombination inserts.Table IAcinetobacter strains generated in this studyStrainDescriptionReference or sourceADP1Juni, E., & Janik, A.

By using the appropriate oligonucleotides (see Supplemental Material, Table II), a three-way PCR product was produced and used to transform strain PS6434. The transformed cells were then plated on LB plates (without NaCl) supplemented with 6% sucrose at 30 °C. The sucrose resistant transformants were screened for the loss of spectomycin resistance. The sucrose-resistant spectinomycin sensitive colonies were analyzed by PCR to check for correct integration of the ykvJKLM operon to give strain PS6437. The ykvJ::Km and ykvL::Km alleles were then introduced into strain PS6437 by transformation with the appropriate amplified deletion-cassette PCR products (used previously to produce strain PS6381 (ykvJ::Km) and strain PS6378 (ykvL::Km)) to give strains PS6447 and PS6449, respectively. Purification of Bulk tRNA and Enzymatic Digestions—Each deletion strain (4 liters) was grown overnight at 37 °C in 6-liter flasks of LB media supplemented with kanamycin (50 μg/ml), harvested, and then stored at -20 °C. The cell pellets were defrosted and resuspended in 20 ml of resuspension buffer (0.3 ○ NaOAc, 10 m○ EDTA, pH 4.3) and extracted with buffer-saturated phenol, pH 4.3 (Sigma). The aqueous layer was collected, and the RNA was precipitated with ethanol. The bulk tRNA was then purified on Nucleobond AX-500 columns (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA) (according to the manufacturer's protocol) and precipitated with isopropanol. HPLC and Electrospray Mass Spectrometry Analysis of Digested Bulk tRNA—To compare the nucleoside constituents of the bulk tRNA purified from wild-type strain ADP1, single-gene-deletion strains, and complemented deletion strains, samples of each purified bulk tRNA (1 mg) were enzymatically hydrolyzed (25Crain P.F. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 193: 782-790Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar) and the digestion products were used directly for HPLC analysis (26Pomerantz S.C. McCloskey J.A. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 193: 796-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). HPLC was performed (typically with 200 μg of tRNA nucleoside per run) with a flow rate of 1.5 ml/min with 5 m○ NH4Oac, pH 6.0, for 60 min and a gradient of 0-20% (40:60, v/v) ACN/H2O on a Supelco C18 reverse-phase analytical column (Sigma). HPLC chromatograms of the bulk tRNA's nucleoside constituents from single-gene-deletion strains and ykvJKLM-complemented strains were then compared with constituents from the wild-type strain. Fractions were collected in a region of the HPLC chromatogram with retention times of 22-28 min and then lyophilized. These fractions were resuspended in H2O, pooled, and again lyophilized to remove any further salt. The samples were then resuspended in methanol or methanol/water mixes and analyzed by ESI-MS. Identifying preQ1 Biosynthesis Gene Candidates by Comparative Genomics—Phylogenetic occurrence was the first criterion used to identify potential preQ1 biosynthesis gene candidates. To generate an occurrence profile in a given organism, the combined presence of both tgt and queA (the only other known gene in the Q biosynthesis pathway) in the genome was used as a marker of the Q biosynthesis pathway. The two organisms (S. cerevisiae and Mycoplasma) whose tRNAs lack the Q modification did not contain tgt ((clusters of orthologous groups (COG)-0343) and queA (COG0809) in their genomes. Interestingly, tgt and queA homologs were also absent from Mycobacterial species and Treponema pallidum, suggesting that Q is absent from these organisms. The second stage was to use the predicted catalytic mechanism of the preQ1 biosynthetic gene products to guide a COG data base search. Early labeling studies showed that GTP is the precursor of preQ1 (14Kuchino Y. Kasai H. Nihei K. Nishimura S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1976; 3: 393-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). An uncharacterized GTP cyclohydrolase was proposed to catalyze the first step in the Q biosynthesis pathway (13Morris R.C. Elliott M.S. Mol. Genet. Metab. 2001; 74: 147-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). A search of the COG data base for GTP cyclohydrolases identified the two known GTP cyclohydrolase families involved in riboflavin (ribA) and tetrahydrofolate synthesis (folE). It also extracted COG0780, annotated as an “enzyme related to GTP cyclohydrolase I.” Importantly, no orthologs were found in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Mycoplasma Mycobacterium, and T. pallidum. Therefore, the COG0780 family met our phylogenetic criteria. Several critical residues for the GTP cyclohydrolase I (CYH) family members have been identified (27Auerbach G. Nar H. Biol. Chem. 1997; 378: 185-192PubMed Google Scholar). Cys 110, His 113, and Cys 181 are zinc-binding residues that are strictly conserved. His 179 has been implicated in enzymatic events occurring after ring opening (28Bracher A. Fischer M. Eisenreich W. Ritz H. Schramek N. Boyle P. Gentili P. Huber R. Nar H. Auerbach G. Bacher A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16727-16735Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). However, only Cys 110 is conserved in the COG0780 family, suggesting that, although both families share a common ancestor, the reaction catalyzed by this enzyme family might differ from that of the CYH family. Genes encoding enzymes of the same pathway have a probability higher than random chance of being physically linked (29Overbeek R. Fonstein M. D'Souza M. Pusch G.D. Maltsev N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 2896-2901Crossref PubMed Scopus (997) Google Scholar). Analysis of the neighboring regions of the COG0780 members in many organisms revealed that the COG0780 member ykvM was the last gene of the ykvJKLM operon in B. subtilis (Fig. 2a). The remaining three genes (ykvJ, K, and L) were absent in S. cerevisiae, Mycoplasma and Mycobacterium, thus fulfilling the occurrence criteria. In addition, in 80% of the organisms whose genomes are completely sequenced, two or three of these four genes are clustered together in different combinations in operons (Fig. 2b). This observation suggested that all four families were involved in the same pathway. The ykvL COG0602 has been annotated as nrdG. However, this COG is divided into two subfamilies: one containing nrdG homologs that encode the anaerobic class III ribonucleotide reductase, and the other containing the ykvL subclass that is clearly distinct from nrdG. All genes in the two subfamilies have been identified as part of the SAM superfamily of genes that encode proteins that generate radical species of S-adenosylmethionine through unusual Fe-S centers. They also catalyze diverse reactions such as methylation, isomerizations, sulfur insertions, ring formation, anaerobic oxidations, and protein radical formation (30Frey P.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 121-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Interestingly, an iron-dependent enzyme is known to be present on the Q biosynthesis pathway (31Kersten H. Biofactors. 1988; 1: 27-29PubMed Google Scholar). The ykvK COG0720 has been annotated as 6-pyruvoyl-tetrahydropterin synthase, an enzyme involved in tetrahydropterin (BH4) biosynthesis in higher animals (27Auerbach G. Nar H. Biol. Chem. 1997; 378: 185-192PubMed Google Scholar). Because BH4 is not found in most bacteria, the function of members of this family in Escherichia coli or B. subtilis is not clear. Recently, the ykvK homolog in E. coli (ygcM) was cloned and expressed and showed to have some 6-pyruvoyl-tetrahydropterin synthase activity (8.7% of the mammal counterpart; Ref. 32Woo H.J. Hwang Y.K. Kim Y.J. Kang J.Y. Choi Y.K. Kim C.G. Park Y.S. FEBS Lett. 2002; 523: 234-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The gene product of the E. coli ygcM gene can also convert sepiaterin to 7,8-dihydropterin without any cofactor, thus showing a new activity of sepiapterin C6 side chain cleavage. (Because sepiaterin is also not present in E. coli, the physiological substrate and true in vivo activity of this enzyme are unknown.) The ykvJ COG0603 has been annotated as an ATPase aluminum-resistance gene. To date, no biochemical studies have validated this assignment. Analysis of Single-gene-deletion Strains Show Lack of Q Modification in tRNA—To test whether each of the four different gene families identified by comparative genomics were Q biosynthesis genes, single-deletion strains for each of the Acinetobacter homologous genes were generated (PS6334, PS6338, PS6378, and PS6381; see “Experimental Procedures”). All four strains had growth rates similar to that of the wild-type and Δtgt::Km strains. In parallel, two additional single-gene deletions were also generated as controls. First, tgt was deleted from the Acinetobacter genome. This deletion prevented transfer of preQ1 to tRNA and hence the formation of Q (15Okada N. Noguchi S. Kasai H. Shindo-Okada N. Ohgi T. Goto T. Nishimura S. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 3067-3073Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Second, a gene not implicated in the preQ1 biosynthesis was deleted as a control for any effects of the presence of the Km cassette (results not shown). Enzymatically digested bulk tRNAs from all six deletion strains were then compared (by HPLC) with the wild-type ADP1 strain for the presence or absence of Q. For enzymatically digested bulk tRNA, Q is known to elute on the Superlco reverse phase column between guanosine and adenosine (Fig. 3; Ref. 26Pomerantz S.C. McCloskey J.A. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 193: 796-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). The HPLC profile was studied in detail between those two peaks, using tRNAs from each of the six single-gene-deletion strains and from the wild-type ADP1 strain (Fig. 4). The HPLC chromatogram for digests of tRNA isolated from the wild-type strain showed a small but pronounced peak with an average elution time of 26.8 min. This peak was absent from tRNAs of the Δtgt::Km strain and was, therefore, assigned to Q. Examination of bulk tRNA extracted from strains deleted in any of the ykvJ, K, L, and M genes showed HPLC patterns in the 22- to 28-min region identical to the chromatogram of the tRNA extracted from the Δtgt::Km strain (absence of the queuosine nucleotide peak). The ΔyadB::Km control for the influence of the Km cassette showed an HPLC profile of isolated tRNA digests that was indistinguishable from that of the wild-type strain (data not shown).Fig. 4Comparison of HPLC chromatograms of enzymatically digested bulk tRNA from wild-type Acinetobacter and from strains harboring single deletions of potential Q biosynthetic genes. HPLC profiles of bulk tRNA nucleoside digests from wild-type, Δtgt, and single-gene-deletion strains (ΔykvJ, ΔykvK, ΔykvL, and ΔykvM) were performed as detailed under “Experimental Procedures.” Chromatograms show peaks with retention times in the 22- to 30-min region, with the peak for Q labeled in the wild-type sample. For clarity, small run-to-run variations in peak retention times were normalized to the average retention time of the adenosine reference peak.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To confirm that the single ykvJ, K, L, and M deletion strains lacked the Q modification in their bulk tRNAs, elution fractions were collected in the 22- to 28-min region of each HPLC profile, lyophilized, and then examined by ESI-MS (Fig. 5). The results showed an m/z = 410 Da (equivalent to that of protonated Q) in digests of tRNAs from the wild-type and ΔyadB::Km strain. No such mass was present in digests of tRNA from the Δtgt::Km strain or in any of the four ykvJ, K, L, and M single-genedeletion strains. Thus, like the tgt strain, the deletion strains did not contain Q in their tRNA. These data strongly support the hypothesis that the ykvJKLM cluster encodes proteins involved in the biosynthesis of Q. The B. subtilis ykvJKLM Operon Complements Single-genedeletion Strains Defective in Q Modification—To eliminate the possibility of polar effects, the whole B. subtilis ykvJKLM operon was introduced ectopically under the PlipA promoter and combined with the ΔykvJ or ΔykvL deletions to give strains PS6447 and PS6449, respectively. Nucleoside constituents of bulk tRNA samples from the complemented strains were checked by HPLC (Fig. 6). The single ΔykvJ::Km and ΔykvL:: Km deletion strains complemented by the B. subtilis operon showed a nucleoside peak with a retention time similar to that of the ADP1 strain. Nucleoside constituents from tRNAs isolated from each of the two complemented strains showed ESI-MS peaks of 410 Da, equivalent to protonated Q (data not shown). Thus, successful complementation demonstrated that loss of Q in the single ΔykvJ::Km and ΔykvL::Km deletion strains is not a result of an artifact of the deletion procedure but is rather due to the removal of genes involved in Q biosynthesis. The other single-gene-deletion strains were not tested. After consultation with K. E. Rudd of the Ecogene data base (University of Miami, Miami, FL) and M. Berlyn of the E. coli Genetic Stock Center data base (Yale University, New Haven, CT), the ykvJ, ykvK, ykvL, and ykvM (B. subtilis) genes identified here have been renamed queC, queD, queE, and queF, respectively. Although the Q hypermodification was discovered early and proved to be one of the most complex tRNA modifications, only two of the enzymes involved in its biosynthesis had been elucidated. This situation was primarily due to the lack of a selectable phenotype linked to this nucleoside. Comparative genomics enabled us to overcome the inherent difficulty of identifying gene families involved in Q biosynthesis. The identification of four gene families underlines the relatively complex chemistry required to produce hypermodified 7-deazaguanine nucleoside from the simple starting block of a purine ring. The proposed biosynthetic pathway in Fig. 1 flags a number of unknown steps. If the pathway is correct, then the four gene products of queC, -D, -E, and -F could potentially be used to find key intermediates and activities on the Q biosynthetic pathway by employing standard molecular cloning and biochemical approaches. Because preQ0 is known to be an intermediate in the formation of the ubiquitous archaeal tRNA-modified nucleoside archaeosine (18Watanabe M. Matsuo M. Tanaka S. Akimoto H. Asahi S. Nishimura S. Katze J.R. Hashizume T. Crain P.F. McCloskey J.A. Okada N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20146-20151Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), Q and archaeosine may share a common 7-deazaguanosine biosynthesis pathway. Examination of the genomes of archae indicates that these organisms contain the ykvJ, K, and L homologs but are missing the ykvM homolog (except in Aeropyrum pernix) that is believed to be a GTP cyclohydrolase homolog (see above). In this scenario, the ykvM gene product is most likely involved in one of the steps converting GTP to preQ0. Two explanations for the phylogenetic distribution of ykvM are possible. First, the ykvM gene product could be involved in the preQ0 biosynthesis in bacteria and has been displaced by another enzyme in archaea. (For example, archaea have a third class of GTP cyclohydrolases that could be involved in archaeosine biosynthesis; Ref. 33Graupner M. Xu H. White R.H. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 1952-1957Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar.) Second, the ykvM gene product, although sharing significant homology with GTP cyclohydrolases, might instead encode an enzyme in bacteria involved in converting preQ0 to preQ1, a reaction that does not occur in archae. However, to satisfy the latter hypothesis, an existing bacterial GTP cyclohydrolase would be needed to catalyze the first predicted step in Q biosynthesis. Further studies are underway to discriminate between these two hypotheses. The genome sequencing efforts of the last decade have revealed how little is known about the relationship between DNA sequences and biological functions. In the best genetically characterized organisms, a third of the genes have no assigned function. Analysis of the literature reveals many known enzymatic activities or pathways for which the cognate genes remain unknown. The tentative identification of these “missing” genes by comparative genomics may turn out to be a general approach to link genes to function (34Osterman A. Overbeek R. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 2003; 7: 238-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar), once confirmation is obtained by the kind of genetic and biochemical analysis described here. We thank H. Grosjean and D.

Full-length CA XIV is a transmembrane protein composed of an extracellular catalytic domain, a single transmembrane helix, and a short intracellular polypeptide segment. The amino acid sequence identity of human CA XIV relative to the other membrane-associated isozymes (CA IV, CA IX, and CA XII) is 34-46%. We report here the expression and purification of both the full-length enzyme and a truncated, secretory form of murine CA XIV. Both forms of this isozyme are highly active, and both show an abrogation of activity in the presence of 0.2% SDS, in contrast to the behavior of murine CA IV. We also report the crystal structure of the extracellular domain of murine CA XIV at 2.8 Å resolution and of an enzyme-acetazolamide complex at 2.9 Å resolution. The structure shows a monomeric glycoprotein with a topology similar to that of other mammalian CA isozymes. Based on the x-ray crystallographic results, we compare and contrast known structures of membrane-associated CA isozymes to rationalize the structural elements responsible for the SDS resistance of CA IV and to discuss prospects for the design of selective inhibitors of membrane-associated CA isozymes.

Carbonic anhydrases (CAs) 1The abbreviation used is: CA, carbonic anhydrase. are zinc-containing enzymes that catalyze the reversible hydration of carbon dioxide (CO2+H2O⇔HCO3-+H+). This simple chemical reaction has important implications for pH homeostasis, carbon dioxide and ion transport, respiration, and many other critical processes in living systems (1Parkkila S. Chegwidden W.R. Carter N.D. Edwards Y.H. The Carbonic Anhydrases: New Horizons. Birkhaüser Verlag, Basel, Switzerland2000: 79-93Crossref Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The CAs fall into three distinct classes (α, β, and γ) on the basis of sequence and structural similarity (2Hewett-Emmett D. Chegwidden W.R. Carter N.D. Edwards Y.H. The Carbonic Anhydrases: New Horizons. Birkhaüser Verlag, Basel, Switzerland2000: 29-76Crossref Scopus (105) Google Scholar). All mammalian CAs belong to the α class, of which there are at least 11 enzymatically active isozymes. Additional CA-related proteins lacking intact zinc-binding sites have been identified based on amino acid sequence identity to active isozymes (3Tashian R.E. Hewett-Emmett D. Carter N. Bergenhem N.C.H. Chegwidden W.R. Carter N.D. Edwards Y.H. The Carbonic Anhydrases: New Horizons. Birkhäuser Verlag, Basel, Switzerland2000: 105-120Crossref Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The CAs are ubiquitous in mammalian tissues, but individual isozymes display tissue-specific distributions (1Parkkila S. Chegwidden W.R. Carter N.D. Edwards Y.H. The Carbonic Anhydrases: New Horizons. Birkhaüser Verlag, Basel, Switzerland2000: 79-93Crossref Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Further distinctions in isozyme localization are due to the cytosolic, membrane-associated, or secretory nature of specific CAs. The varying tissue distributions have been exploited for the development of CA inhibitors targeted to specific regions of the body, the most notable example being topically applied compounds such as dorzolamide and brinzolamide for the treatment of glaucoma (4Sugrue M.F. Prog. Retinal Eye Res. 2000; 19: 87-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). Subtle structural differences among the CA isozymes also hold promise for the development of isozyme-specific inhibitors, certain examples of which have been demonstrated (5Supuran C.T. Scozzafava A. Casini A. Med. Res. Rev. 2003; 23: 146-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (1165) Google Scholar). The most recently identified mammalian CA isozyme is CA XIV. Through the use of Northern blotting and reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction techniques, CA XIV mRNA has been demonstrated in kidney, liver, brain, skeletal muscle, heart, and lung (6Mori K.

CA XIV is a bitopic membrane protein with an extracellular N-terminal catalytic domain, a single membrane-spanning segment, and a small intracellular C-terminal polypeptide containing potential phosphorylation sites (6Mori K. Ogawa Y. Ebihara K. Tamura N. Tashiro K. Kuwahara T. Mukoyama M. Sugawara A. Ozaki S. Tanaka I. Nakao K. J. Biol.

Genomics. 1999; 61: 74-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). The first 15 amino acids are hydrophobic and constitute a signal sequence, and the catalytic domain contains one putative N-glycosylation site (6Mori K. Ogawa Y. Ebihara K. Tamura N. Tashiro K.

Nishimori I. Taguchi T. Onishi S. Genomics. 1999; 61: 74-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). This topology is similar to that of the other transmembrane isozymes, CA IX and CA XII. A fourth isozyme, CA IV, is also membrane-associated, but the post-translational attachment of a glycosylphosphatidylinositol group to the C terminus of CA IV serves as the membrane anchor rather than the polypeptide itself (11Zhu X.L. Sly W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 8795-8801Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The amino acid sequence identity of human CA XIV relative to the other three membrane-bound CA isozymes is 34-46%. CA XIV also shares 38% sequence identity with CA VI, an extracellular, secreted isozyme found in saliva. Despite similarities in amino acid sequences and overall topology, the membrane-associated CAs differ in tissue distribution. CA XIV is found in regions of liver cells distinct from the location of CA IV (10Parkkila S. Kivelä A.J. Kaunisto K. Parkkila A.-K. Hakkola J. Rajaniemi H. Waheed A. Sly W.S. BMC Gastroenterol. 2002; 2: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), although certain regions of the kidney show positive immunostaining for both of these isozymes, suggesting redundant function (8Kaunisto K. Parkkila S. Rajaniemi H. Waheed A. Grubb J. Sly W.S. Kidney Int. 2002; 61: 2111-2118Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Intriguingly, the presence of an extracellular carbonic anhydrase has long been suspected in mammalian brain (12Walz W. Can. J. Physiol. Pharmacol. 1989; 67: 577-581Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 13Chen J.C.T. Chesler M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 7786-7790Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Known CA inhibitors, including compounds that are impermeable to cells, were shown to enhance the extracellular alkaline shift observed in slices of hippocampus after synaptic transmission (12Walz W. Can. J. Physiol. Pharmacol. 1989; 67: 577-581Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 13Chen J.C.T. Chesler M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Recent immunostaining results identify CA XIV on neurons and axons in both mouse and human brain, suggesting that this isozyme is responsible for modulating pH shifts during excitatory synaptic transmission (9Parkkila S. Parkkila A.-K. Rajaniemi H. Shah G.N. Grubb J.H. Waheed A. Sly W.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 1918-1923Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). The other two transmembrane isozymes, CA IX and CA XII, show a varied tissue distribution, but both are overexpressed in certain cancers, and their transcription is regulated by the von Hippel-Landau tumor suppressor (15McKiernan J.M.

We report here the expression, purification, and assay of the soluble, extracellular domain of murine CA XIV and its structure determination by x-ray crystallographic methods. The x-ray structure confirms that CA XIV is a glycoprotein and helps define its quaternary structure relative to its solution behavior and its similarity to the related CA XII isozyme. The structure of murine CA XIV complexed with acetazolamide is also presented. Based on the structures of CAs IV, XII, and XIV, we rationalize the structural elements responsible for the unique SDS resistance of CA IV. This resistance allowed CA IV to be solubilized from tissues by SDS and purified in the presence of SDS, conditions under which other known CAs were inactive (11Zhu X.L. Sly W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 8795-8801Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); subsequently, resistance to SDS became a practical means of determining the contribution of CA IV to total activity in tissues. Finally, prospects for the design of inhibitors selective for the extracellular CA isozymes are discussed based on the structural data. Expression and Purification—The cDNA was cloned by PCR using mRNA from C57BL6 mouse kidney using primers designed by Mori et al. (6Mori K. Ogawa Y. Ebihara K. Tamura N. Tashiro K. Kuwahara T.

The sequence 2In this work, the CA XIV sequence was numbered based on alignment with human CA II (see Fig. 3). Inserted residues are numbered by the point of insertion with a letter appended (e.g. 11A, 11B, etc.). differs from that reported for CA XIV from BalbC (6Mori K. Ogawa Y. Ebihara K. Tamura N.

Mammalian expression vectors containing the cDNA of the wild-type, full-length membrane form and secretory form (I261X) of murine CA XIV were constructed as described (9Parkkila S. Parkkila A.-K.

Stable Chinese hamster ovary clones expressing the secretory or the full-length membrane form of murine CA XIV were isolated and characterized by CA activity following established procedures (23Ulmasov B. Waheed A. Shah G.N. Grubb J.H. Sly W.S. Tu C. Silverman D.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 14212-14217Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). A full-length, membrane form of murine CA XII cDNA was subcloned into the mammalian expression vector pCXN (24Niwa H. Yamamura K.-I. Miyazaki J.-I. Gene (Amst.). 1991; 108: 193-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (4617) Google Scholar) and transiently expressed in COS-7 cells (19Türeci O. Sahin U. Vollmar E. Siemer S. Göttert E. Seitz G. Parkkila A.-K.

The enzyme expression was analyzed by CA activity measurements (25Sundaram V. Rumbolo P. Grubb J.H. Strisciuglio P. Sly W.S. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1986; 38: 125-136PubMed Google Scholar). The I261X secretory form of murine CA XIV, designated CA14x, was purified from secretion medium using CA inhibitor affinity chromatography (11Zhu X.L. Sly W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 8795-8801Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The secretion medium was applied to a CA inhibitor affinity column equilibrated with 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.5). The unbound protein was removed by washing with equilibration buffer containing 0 mm and then 150 mm NaCl. The bound enzyme was eluted with 0.1 m sodium acetate containing 0.5 m sodium perchlorate (pH 5.5). The eluted enzyme was concentrated and dialyzed against 10 mm Tris-SO4 (pH 7.5). The homogeneity of the enzyme was assessed by size exclusion chromatography using Sephacryl S-300, SDS-PAGE, and specific activity (25Sundaram V. Rumbolo P. Grubb J.H. Strisciuglio P. Sly W.S. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1986; 38: 125-136PubMed Google Scholar). Activity Assays—CA activity was measured by the procedure of Maren (26Maren T.H. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1960; 130: 26-29PubMed Google Scholar), as described (25Sundaram V. Rumbolo P. Grubb J.H. Strisciuglio P. Sly W.S. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1986; 38: 125-136PubMed Google Scholar). SDS-resistant CA activity was determined on affinity pure CA samples or membrane-bound CA samples preincubated with 0.2% SDS at room temperature for 30 min prior to activity measurements. The protein concentration was determined by the micro Lowry procedure (27Peterson G.L. Anal. Biochem. 1979; 100: 201-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (886) Google Scholar). CA activity is expressed in enzyme units/mg of cell protein for unpurified enzyme or in enzyme units/mg of affinity pure CA. Crystallization and Data Collection—The CA14x protein was crystallized at room temperature by the hanging drop vapor diffusion method. Drops containing 1.8 μl of 7 mg/ml enzyme in 20 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.2) and 150 mm NaCl were mixed with 1.8 μl of precipitant buffer (5.5% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 4000, 0.1 m sodium acetate, pH 4.8, 20 mm NaCl) and equilibrated over a well containing 1.0 ml of precipitant buffer. Crystals appeared in the drops within 48 h and grew as long, thin rods to maximum dimensions of 0.7 × 0.03 × 0.03 mm3. For data collection, a microspatula was used to break the rods into shorter pieces that were subsequently harvested into a stabilizing buffer containing 10% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 4000, 0.1 m sodium acetate (pH 4.8), 20 mm NaCl, and 10% (v/v) glycerol. After sequential transfers to stabilizing solutions containing 15 and 25% (v/v) glycerol, the crystals were flash cooled in liquid nitrogen. Diffraction data to 2.8 Å resolution were collected from a single CA14x crystal at beamline X25 of the National Synchrotron Light Source at the Brookhaven National Laboratories. The data were processed with the HKL suite (28Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38617) Google Scholar) and TRUNCATE (29Collaborative Computational Project No 4Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19797) Google Scholar). The crystals belonged to space group P21 with unit cell dimensions a = 59.0 Å, b = 75.6 Å, c = 73.2 Å, and β = 98.9°; with two molecules in the asymmetric unit, the Matthew's coefficient VM = 2.65 Å3/Da (53% solvent content). For preparation of the CA14x-acetazolamide complex, the crystals were soaked in a stabilizing solution containing 10% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 4000, 22% (v/v) glycerol, 0.1 m sodium acetate (pH 5.5), 20 mm NaCl, and 5 mm acetazolamide for 90 h prior to flash cooling in liquid nitrogen.

Rotation searches using diffraction data from 15-3.5 Å resolution yielded two clear solutions, as ranked by correlation coefficient. Subsequent translation searches placed two molecules in the asymmetric unit, and rigid body refinement lowered the R factor to 0.453. Model building was performed with the program O (32Jones T.A. Zou J.-Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect.

Strict noncrystallographic symmetry constraints were applied during initial refinement cycles and were subsequently released into heavily weighted restraints (ω = 300 kcal/mol Å2) for all atoms except those that displayed obvious differences between the two molecules, e.g. due to crystal lattice contacts. The data were refined against a maximum likelihood target function as implemented in CNS, and a bulk solvent correction was employed (ksol = 0.35 e Å-3 was defined) (34Fokine A. Urzhumstev A.

Solvent molecules were built into the model at positions where the Fo-Fc maps contained peaks of ≥3.0 σ that displayed appropriate hydrogen bonding interactions. The final model had Rcryst = 0.234 (Rfree = 0.274) and included two copies of the CA14x polypeptide, two zinc ions, two acetate ions, four N-acetylglucosamine rings, one mannose ring, and 90 solvent molecules. Geometric parameters were analyzed with PROCHECK (35Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl.

The structure of the CA14x-acetazolamide complex was solved using the difference Fourier method starting from the wild-type CA14x structure less all zinc ions, acetate ions, solvent molecules, and sugar moieties. Rigid body, positional, and grouped temperature factor refinements in CNS resulted in a final model having Rcryst = 0.207 (Rfree = 0.253). The refinement protocol was the same as that used for the native CA14x structure, except that an initial B factor correction was applied to the data. The final model contained two CA14x polypeptide chains, two zinc ions, two acetazolamide molecules, four N-acetylglucosamine rings, two mannose rings, and 32 water molecules. The data refinement statistics for both structures are recorded in Table I. Molecular Characterization and Enzyme Activity—Affinity-purified CA14x migrates as a 44-kDa polypeptide on SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1). However, the calculated molecular mass of CA14x deduced from its amino acid sequence is 29.5 kDa. Therefore, the increase in apparent molecular mass of CA14x and the presence of one consensus sequence for N-glycosylation suggest that murine CA XIV is a glycoprotein. Accordingly, the affinity-purified mouse CA14x produced in the glycosylation-defective Lec-1 cell line shows a slightly smaller apparent molecular mass on SDS-PAGE (data not shown). Moreover, CA14x eluted as single peak of 120-kDa mass during size exclusion chromatography on Sephacryl S-300. Because the mass of the monomeric glycopeptide estimated by SDS-PAGE was 44 kDa, these results suggest either that native CA14x exists as a multimer in solution or that its migration on an S-300 column deviates from that of an ideal globular protein. X-ray crystallographic results support the latter explanation (see below). The specific activity of pure recombinant glycosylated CA14x produced in Chinese hamster ovary cells was compared with unglycosylated murine CA II and glycosylated murine CAs IV and XII. The results are presented in Table II. The specific activity of CA XIV (3284 enzyme units/mg) is higher than any of the other isozymes investigated, including CA II. Unlike murine CA IV, CA14x and the secretory form of CA XII were SDS-sensitive. Membrane-associated CA XII and CA XIV were also SDS-sensitive, indicating that CA IV is more stable than even the wild-type transmembrane isozymes. Because CA IV, CA XII, and CA XIV share a common disulfide bond between Cys-23 and Cys-203, the increased stability of CA IV must be ascribed to the additional disulfide bond between Cys-6 and Cys-13 of this isozyme.Table IISpecific activity and SDS resistance of murine carbonic anhydrase isozymesSDS sensitivityaAffinity pure carbonic anhydrase equivalent to 1 enzyme unit, or cell membrane suspension equivalent to 0.5 enzyme unit, was exposed to 0.2% SDS at room temperature for 30 min before activity assay.IsozymeEnzyme units/mg pure CASecretory formMembrane formCA II2500SensitiveCA IVbMurine CA IV has lower activity than murine CA II, as shown, although human CA IV and CA II both have comparable, high level activity (51).436ResistantResistantCA XII155SensitiveSensitiveCA XIV3284SensitiveSensitivea Affinity pure carbonic anhydrase equivalent to 1 enzyme unit, or cell membrane suspension equivalent to 0.5 enzyme unit, was exposed to 0.2% SDS at room temperature for 30 min before activity assay.b Murine CA IV has lower activity than murine CA II, as shown, although human CA IV and CA II both have comparable, high level activity (51Tamai S.

Open table in a new tab Overall Structure of Murine CA XIV—The structure of the extracellular catalytic domain of murine CA XIV reveals a polypeptide fold characteristic of the α-CA isozymes in which a 10-stranded β-sheet forms the core of the molecule (Fig. 2). A single disulfide linkage is present between residues Cys-23 and Cys-203 that is identical to disulfide bonds found in the membrane-associated isozymes CA IV and CA XII. This disulfide bond helps to stabilize a polypeptide loop in the active site containing Thr-199, a residue that promotes efficient catalysis by orienting the nucleophilic zinc-bound solvent molecule through a hydrogen bonding interaction (36Merz Jr., K.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 214: 799-802Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 37Xue Y. Liljas A. Jonsson B.-H. Lindskog S. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 1993; 17: 93-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Additionally, because CA14x was produced in Chinese hamster ovary cells, the molecule is glycosylated. Both molecules in the asymmetric unit exhibit electron density consistent with N-glycosylation of Asn-195. The CA14x-acetazolamide structure exhibits the highest quality electron density for the carbohydrate. In molecule B, four of the sugar rings that form the core pentasaccharide commonly found in N-glycosylation are visible: two N-acetylglucosamine and two mannose moieties. Molecule A exhibits electron density for only the two N-acetylglucosamines. The catalytic domain of CA XIV exhibits only minor differences compared with the structure of CA XII (31Whittington D.A. Waheed A. Ulmasov B. Shah G.N. Grubb J.H. Sly W.S. Christianson D.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 9545-9550Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar), the most closely related transmembrane isozyme. Two loop regions vary between these isozymes; CA XIV has an insert in the Gly-151-Glu-153 loop and a deletion in the Thr-233-Pro-240 loop relative to CA XII. A structure-based sequence alignment is presented in Fig. 3. The catalytic domains of CA XII and CA XIV contain N-glycosylation sites at differing locations in their sequence, but the protein backbones still superimpose well (root mean square deviation = 1.1 Å for 255 Cα atoms). The most striking difference between CA XII and CA XIV is quaternary structure; CA XII is a dimer with 2200 Å2 buried surface area between monomers, whereas CA XIV appears monomeric. The largest surface area buried between adjacent CA XIV molecules in the crystal lattice is 730 Å2 (365 Å2/monomer), which includes the surface area of the carbohydrate, whereas statistical analyses of the buried surface between a large sampling of biological dimers suggests a minimum buried surface area of 1700 Å2 (860 Å2/monomer) (38Ponstingl H. Henrick K. Thornton J.M. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 2000; 41: 47-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). The packing of these two CA14x molecules also occludes the active site of one, further arguing against the existence of a functional CA XIV dimer, and the majority of amino acids present in the human CA XII dimer interface are not conserved in human or murine CA XIV.

The GAT (GGA and Tom1) domains of GGAs have previously been shown to interact with GTP-bound ARF and to be crucial for membrane recruitment of GGAs. Here we show that the C-terminal subdomain of the GAT domain, which is distinct from the N-terminal GAT subdomain responsible for ARF binding, can bind ubiquitin. The binding is mediated by interactions between residues on one side of the α3 helix of the GAT domain and those on the so-called Ile-44 surface patch of ubiquitin. The binding of the GAT domain to ubiquitin can be enhanced by the presence of a GTP-bound form of ARF. Furthermore, GGA itself is ubiquitinated in a manner dependent on the GAT-ubiquitin interaction. These results delineate the molecular basis for the interaction between ubiquitin and GAT and suggest that GGA-mediated trafficking is regulated by the ubiquitin system as endosomal trafficking mediated by other ubiquitin-binding proteins.

In mammalian cells, ubiquitin-dependent transport to the MVB/lysosome has so far been demonstrated only along the endocytic pathway, such as that of the epidermal growth factor receptor. Cells transmit the ubiquitination signals through proteins containing conserved ubiquitin-binding modules including the UBA (ubiquitin-associated domain), CUE (coupling of ubiquitin to endoplasmic reticulum degradation domain), UIM (ubiquitin-interacting motif), UEV (ubiquitin E2 variant domain), and NZF (Npl4 zinc finger domain) (see Ref. 4Schnell J.D. Hicke L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 35857-35860Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar and references therein). One or combinations of these domains are often found in proteins implicated in endocytic processes, such as MVB pathway. GGAs (Golgi-localizing, γ-adaptin ear domain homology, ARF-binding proteins) are a family of monomeric adaptor proteins that regulates clathrin-mediated trafficking of cargo proteins from the trans-Golgi network (TGN) to endosomes (5Boman A.L.

EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1371-1380Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Although Tom1 also contains the VHS domain (12Dell'Angelica E.C. Puertollano R. Mullins C. Aguliar R.C. Vargas J.D.

Takatsu and K. Nakayama, unpublished results. In the course of searching for binding partners of Tom1, we have found that the GAT domains interact with ubiquitin. We here show that the GGA-GAT domain binds ARF and ubiquitin through distinct subdomains and its binding to active ARF enhances the efficiency of the ubiquitin binding. Furthermore, we show that GGA itself is ubiquitinated in a manner dependent on the GAT-ubiquitin interaction. Our results suggest that GGA might regulate membrane trafficking in a ubiquitin-dependent manner. Plasmid Construction—Vectors for domains of human GGA1 (VHS+GAT (residues 1-327); VHS-(1-147); GAT-(141-327); and C-terminal region (residues 306-639) and GGA2 (GAT-(157-342)) and GGA3L (VHS+GAT-(1-320); VHS-(1-146); GAT-(139-320); and C-terminal region (residues 320-723)) were constructed as described previously (10Takatsu H.

Deletions of the GGA3-GAT domain (C-GAT-(209-320); α2+α3-(236-320); and Δα3-(139-275)) were constructed by a PCR-based strategy (see Fig. 1). For expression in mammalian cells, the entire coding region or a domain fragment of the GGA cDNA was subcloned into pcDNA3 with an N-terminal HA- or His6+FLAG tag sequence (16Shin H.-W. Shinotsuka C. Torii S. Murakami K. Nakayama K. J. Biochem. 1997; 122: 525-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar).

Pull-down Assays—GST fusion proteins (50 pmol) of GGA domains purified from Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) were incubated with Ub- (15 μl) or protein A-agarose (30 μl) beads (Sigma) for 1 h at room temperature in buffer A (25 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 125 mm KOAc, 2.5 mm MgOAc, 5 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol) containing 0.1% bovine serum albumen and 0.1% Triton X-100. The beads were then pelleted and washed three times with buffer A. Proteins associated with the beads were subjected to immunoblotting with anti-GST antibody (Sigma). Lysates from E. coli cells expressing His6+T7-tagged GGA3-GAT were pulled down with GST-Ub as above and detected by anti-T7 tag antibody (Novagen). To examine GAT interaction with ubiquitinated proteins, rat liver cytosol (containing 2-mg protein) was incubated with GST fusion proteins (∼20 μg) of the GGA domain pre-bound to glutathione-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences) for 2 h at 4 °C in buffer A containing a protease inhibitor mixture (Complete™ EDTA-free, Roche Diagnostics). Proteins associated with the beads were subjected to immunoblotting with mouse monoclonal antibody to ubiquitin-conjugated protein FK2 (Affiniti Research Products). To examine ubiquitin interaction with endogenous GGA3, a cytosol or membrane fraction of HeLa cells (containing 350-μg protein) was incubated with GST-Ub pre-bound to glutathione-Sepharose at 4 °C for 2 h in buffer A containing Complete EDTA-free. The proteins associated with the beads were subjected to immunoblotting with anti-GGA3 antibody (BD Biosciences). The effect of ARF on the GAT-ubiquitin interaction was examined as follows. A mixture of multi-ubiquitin chain (2 μg; Affiniti Research Products) and varying amounts of purified recombinant ARF1ΔN17 (14Takatsu H. Yoshino K. Toda K. Nakayama K. Biochem. J. 2002; 365: 369-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) was incubated at room temperature for 30 min in 200 μl of buffer B (25 mm Hepes, pH 7.0, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 2 mm EDTA, 0.1% Nonidet P-40) containing 25 μg/ml bovine serum albumen and 200 μm GDP or GTPγS, and MgCl2 was added to the incubation mixture to a final concentration of 7 mm to stop nucleotide exchange. After the addition of 1 μg of recombinant GST-GGA3-VHS+GAT, the mixture was incubated at room temperature for 30 min and further incubated for 30 min after the addition of 20 μl of glutathione-Sepharose beads. The beads were then pelleted and washed three times with buffer B containing 7 mm MgCl2 and 10 μm GDP or GTPγS. Proteins associated with the beads were subjected to immunoblotting with monoclonal anti-ubiquitin antibody P4D1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Immunofluorescence Analyses—HeLa cells grown in 8-well Lab Tek-II chamber slides (Nunc) were transfected with an HA-GGA vector using FuGENE 6 transfection reagent (Roche Diagnostics) and incubated for 15-20 h. The cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100, double-stained with monoclonal rat anti-HA antibody 3F10 (Roche Diagnostics) and the FK2 antibody as described previously (10Takatsu H.

In Vivo Ubiquitination Analyses—Human embryonic kidney 293 cells grown on a 10-cm dish were transfected with expression vectors for His6+FLAG-tagged GGA3 and HA-tagged ubiquitin (a kind gift from Dirk Bohmann, EMBL) (19Treler M. Staszewski L.M. Bohmann D. Cell. 1994; 78: 787-798Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (845) Google Scholar) and incubated for 15-20 h. His6+FLAG-GGA3 was purified by the method of Treler et al. (19Treler M. Staszewski L.M. Bohmann D. Cell. 1994; 78: 787-798Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (845) Google Scholar) with a small modification. Denatured cell lysates (1 ml) were incubated with 50 μl of Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (Qiagen) for 3 h at room temperature, washed, and eluted with 100 μl of buffer containing 300 mm imidazole. The eluate was subjected to 7.5-20 or 7.5% SDS-PAGE, electroblotted onto Immobilon-P membrane (Millipore), and detected with the anti-HA 3F10 antibody (10Takatsu H. Katoh Y. Shiba Y. Nakayama K. J.

GAT Domains Interact with Ubiquitin—A two-hybrid screening of a human brain cDNA library using the VHS+GAT domain of human Tom1 as bait yielded 44 positive clones. Among them, six encoded ubiquitin precursors containing one to six tandem ubiquitin units. Subsequent two-hybrid and pull-down analyses revealed that the GAT domain is responsible for the interaction with ubiquitin. 3Y. Katoh, Y. Shiba, H. Takatsu, and K. Nakayama, submitted for publication. To examine whether the ubiquitin binding is a general feature of the GAT domains, we performed a similar experiment with GGAs. As shown in Fig. 2A, GST fusion proteins containing but not lacking the GAT domain of GGA1 was bound to Ub-agarose beads. As shown in Fig. 2B, the GAT domains of GGA1 and GGA3, but not that of GGA2, was bound to Ub-agarose beads. These data demonstrate that the GAT domains of GGA1 and GGA3 directly interact with ubiquitin. Because the GGA3-GAT binding to ubiquitin was relatively efficient among the GGA-GAT domains examined, we thereafter focused mainly on the GGA3-GAT domain. We then examined the binding ability of the GAT domains to ubiquitinated proteins. Rat liver cytosol was pulled down with the GST-GAT domains pre-bound to glutathione-Sepharose beads and subjected to immunoblotting using the monoclonal antibody FK2, which recognizes monoubiquitinated and polyubiquitinated proteins but not free ubiquitin (20Fujimuro M. Sawada H. Yokosawa H. FEBS Lett. 1994; 349: 173-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar, 21Takada K. Nasu H. Tsukada Y. Ohkawa K. Fujimuro M. Sawada H. Yokosawa H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 233: 42-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2C, the GAT domains of GGA1 (lane 9) and GGA3 (lane 5) but not that of GGA2 (lane 10) could bind ubiquitinated proteins, being in line with the data in Fig. 2B. The VHS domain (lane 4) or the C-terminal region (lane 3) did not bind ubiquitinated proteins. It is notable that compared with the band pattern of ubiquitinated proteins in the original cytosol (lane 11), the GAT domains appeared to bind selected ubiquitin-conjugated proteins (lanes 5 and 9). In a reciprocal experiment, GST-Ub could pull down endogenous GGA3 from both cytosolic and membrane-bound fractions (Fig. 2D). In addition, the expression of GGA3 at moderate to high levels in cells caused accumulation of ubiquitinated proteins detected with the FK2 antibody in the Golgi region (Fig. 2E, a and a′), indicating that GGA3 binds ubiquitinated proteins in the cell. The accumulation of ubiquitinated proteins was specific for GGA3, because such accumulation was not observed in cells expressing GGA2 at high levels (data not shown). The GAT-ubiquitin interaction contributed significantly to the GGA3-dependent accumulation of ubiquitinated proteins because 60% of GGA3-overexpressing cells (n = 50) accumulated ubiquitinated proteins, whereas 34% of cells (n = 50) overexpressing a GGA3 mutant (see below) with a GAT domain defective in ubiquitin binding had accumulated (b and b′). ARF and Ubiquitin Bind Distinct GAT Subdomains—We next attempted to delineate the region of the GGA3-GAT domain required for ubiquitin binding. Recent x-ray crystallographic studies of the GGA1-GAT domain from our and other laboratories have revealed that it possesses an α-helical fold comprising two subdomains (see Fig. 3, A and D) (22Collins B.M.

Surprisingly, the deletion of the N-GAT subdomain significantly enhanced the binding efficiency to ubiquitinated proteins (compare lane 5 for GAT with lane 7 for C-GAT in Fig. 2C). Deletion of the entire α1-helix abolished the binding to ubiquitinated proteins (lane 8), which presumably makes the three-helix bundle unstable. In addition, deletion of the entire α3-helix abolished the binding (lane 6). These data indicate that the C-GAT subdomain comprising a three-helix bundle is responsible for the ubiquitin binding and more importantly that ARF and ubiquitin bind distinct subdomains N-GAT and C-GAT, respectively (Fig. 3D). To further define the interface of the GAT domain with ubiquitin, we subjected the C-GAT subdomain to a reverse two-hybrid screening with ubiquitin to identify C-GAT mutants defective in ubiquitin binding. The screening identified six missense mutants (L247P, L262S, L276S, L280R, D284G, and Y293H) (Fig. 3A). Among these mutations, L247P, L262S, and Y293H seemed to disrupt the packing of the helix bundle deduced from the structure of the GGA1-GAT domain (data not shown). On the other hand, the side chains of Leu-276, Leu-280, and Asp-284 appeared exposed on one side of α3 and could be responsible for protein-protein interactions (see Fig. 3B). The two-hybrid data were confirmed by a pull-down experiment. None of the L276S, L280R, and D284G mutants was not pulled down with Ub-agarose (Fig. 4A). Moreover, unlike wild type full-length GGA3, its L280R mutant overexpressed in the cell did not cause accumulation of ubiquitinated proteins in the Golgi region (Fig. 2E, b and b′). Ubiquitin Binds GAT through Its Ile-44 Patch—On ubiquitin, two surface patches have been shown to participate in binding to the proteasome, UIM, UBA, and CUE domains and in intracellular trafficking, one patch including Ile-44 and the other including Phe-4 (1Hicke L.

To examine which patch is responsible for the GAT binding, His6+T7-tagged GGA3-GAT was incubated with wild type Ub, Ub(F4A), or Ub(I44A) fused to GST, pulled down with glutathione-Sepharose, and subjected to immunoblotting with anti-T7 tag antibody. The experiment revealed that the GAT-ubiquitin interaction requires Ile-44 but not Phe-4 on the ubiquitin surface (Fig. 4B). Mode of GAT-Ubiquitin Interaction—On the basis of the above mutational data and three-dimensional structures of GGA1-GAT and ubiquitin, we constructed the most plausible model for the interaction between GGA3-GAT and ubiquitin (Fig. 3, B and C). In this model, Asp-284 interacts with Arg-42U (the superscript U denotes a residue of ubiquitin), Leu-276 with both Leu-8U and Val-70U, and Leu-280 with both Ile-44U and Val-70U. To address this model, we constructed additional ubiquitin mutants and examined their interactions with GGA3-GAT. As expected, L8A, R42A, and V70A mutations of ubiquitin abolished the GAT binding (Fig. 4B). These data make it most likely that the GAT domain interacts with ubiquitin in a manner presented in this model (Fig. 3, B and C). ARF Binding to GAT Affects Ubiquitin Binding—The data presented here along with the previous data (13Puertollano R. Randazzo P.A. Presley J.F. Hartnell L.M. Bonifacino J.S. Cell. 2001; 105: 93-102Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar, 14Takatsu H. Yoshino K. Toda K. Nakayama K. Biochem. J. 2002; 365: 369-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) show that the GAT domain can interact with ARF and ubiquitin through distinct subdomains, N-GAT and C-GAT, respectively. The interface between GAT and ARF and that between GAT and ubiquitin are sterically separated (Fig. 3D). Furthermore, GGA3-GAT mutants defective in ubiquitin binding can bind ARF-GTPγS and a GGA1-GAT mutant defective in ARF binding can bind ubiquitin (data not shown). However, the enhancement of ubiquitin binding by deleting the N-GAT subdomain (compare lanes 5 and 7 in Fig. 2C) suggests a possibility that some conformational change in the N-GAT subdomain may affect ubiquitin binding to the C-GAT subdomain. To address this possibility, multi-ubiquitin chains were pulled down with the GGA3 VHS+GAT domain in the presence of increasing concentrations of purified ARF1-GDP or ARF1-GTPγS (in this experiment, we used VHS+GAT in place of GAT because the former bound ARF more strongly than the latter) and subjected to immunoblotting using the monoclonal anti-ubiquitin antibody P4D1. As shown in Fig. 5, more ubiquitin chain was pulled down with the GGA3-VHS+GAT domain as the increasing concentration of ARF in the presence of GTPγS. In contrast, the ARF-dependent increase in the ubiquitin binding was marginal in the presence of GDP. The results suggest that the binding of ARF to the N-GAT subdomain might allosterically affect the ubiquitin binding to the C-GAT subdomain. GGA Ubiquitination Depends on GAT-Ubiquitin Interaction—A number of, albeit not all, proteins that bind ubiquitin have been reported to undergo monoubiquitination (30Polo S. Sigismund S. Faretta M.

Chem. 2003; 278: 19826-19833Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), although the regulatory mechanism underlying the coupling of ubiquitin binding and ubiquitination is currently uncertain. To examine whether this was also the case with GGA, lysates from cells transfected with expression vectors for various His6+FLAG-tagged GGA3 constructs together with that for HA-ubiquitin were precipitated with Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose beads under denaturing conditions and subjected to immunoblotting with anti-HA antibody to detect ubiquitinated GGA3 or with anti-FLAG antibody to confirm the efficiencies of protein expression and precipitation. As shown in Fig. 6A, full-length GGA3 and constructs containing the GAT domain were efficiently ubiquitinated in the cells. The results indicate that the ubiquitination occurs within the GAT domain. In addition, the difference between the bands detected with anti-FLAG and anti-HA antibodies in size (∼8 kDa) indicates monoubiquitination at least in the cases of the GAT and VHS+GAT constructs, although faint bands suggesting diubiquitination or triubiquitination are also detectable. The VHS domain was slightly ubiquitinated, although we did not address its significance further. The C-terminal construct that includes the hinge region and the γ-adaptin ear homology domain was not ubiquitinated at all. We then examined whether the GAT-ubiquitin interaction is prerequisite for ubiquitination. Unlike wild type full-length GGA3, ubiquitination of the L280R and D284G mutants was extremely reduced in the transfected cells (Fig. 6, B and C), demonstrating that prior ubiquitin binding to the GAT domain makes a major contribution to the GGA ubiquitination. The GAT domain has attracted our attention by its role in ARF binding and concomitant recruitment onto TGN membranes of GGAs. In this study, we have found that the GAT domains can interact with ubiquitin through the C-GAT subdomain, which is distinct from the N-GAT subdomain responsible for ARF binding. However, the GAT-ubiquitin interaction can be enhanced by ARF-GTP. Furthermore, ubiquitination of GGA3 occurs in a manner dependent on the GAT-ubiquitin interaction. The N-GAT subdomain is a helix-loop-helix structure (22Collins B.M. Watson P.J. Owen D.J. Dev. Cell. 2003; 4: 321-332Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 24Shiba T.

EMBO J. 2003; 22: 78-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). By analogy with SNARE-motif binding sites of the syntaxin N-terminal domains, a hydrophobic patch formed by residues of helices α2 and α3 of GAT was proposed to constitute a protein-protein interaction site (23Suer S. Misra S. Saidi L.F. Hurley J.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 4451-4456Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). We have shown that together with Asp-284, the hydrophobic patch of GGA3-GAT indeed participates in ubiquitin binding. On the other hand, we have also delineated the GAT-binding interface of ubiquitin by mutational experiments, although our attempts to make a co-crystal of GAT and ubiquitin have been unsuccessful so far. Similar to interactions with other ubiquitin-binding modules, the Ile-44 surface patch of ubiquitin including Leu-8, Ile-44, Arg-42, and Val-70 mediates the GAT interaction. While this study was in progress, NMR and x-ray analyses revealed structural bases for ubiquitin interactions with CUE, NZF, and UIM (36Kang R.S. Daniels C.M. Francis S.A. Shih S.C. Salerno W.J.

EMBO J. 2003; 22: 4597-4606Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). All of the studies pointed to the importance of the Ile-44 hydrophobic patch in these interactions. The engagement of the overlapping ubiquitin surface by multiple ubiquitin-binding modules including CUE, UIM, NZF, and GAT has important implications in membrane trafficking. For example, these ubiquitin-binding proteins might sequentially interact with the same ubiquitinated cargo protein along the transport pathway. Ubiquitination of these ubiquitin-binding proteins themselves might contribute to the sequential interactions. In contrast to the GAT domains of GGA1, GGA3, and Tom1, we failed to show ubiquitin binding of GGA2-GAT. In the case of other ubiquitin-binding modules, all of the family members cannot interact with ubiquitin (31Shih S.C. Prag G. Francis S.A. Sutanto M.A. Hurley J.H. Hicke L. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 1273-1281Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). However, the residues that we have shown to be essential for ubiquitin binding are identical in all human GGAs. One possible explanation for the apparent discrepancy is that residues other than those we have determined in GGA3-GAT are also essential for ubiquitin interaction but are different from corresponding residues of GGA2-GAT. Alternatively, the GAT domain of GGA2 might be somewhat different from those of GGA3 and GGA1 in the overall structure and might be unable to accept ubiquitin. Structural determination of GGA2-GAT and a complex between GGA3-GAT and ubiquitin will help to discriminate between these possibilities. Another key finding in this study is that ubiquitinated proteins accumulate in the Golgi region in GGA3-overexpressing cells, suggesting an implication of the ubiquitin system in the biosynthetic pathway. In mammalian cells, there has been no evidence for the existence of biosynthetic pathway regulated by the ubiquitin system in contrast to the endocytic pathway, whereas in yeast, some biosynthetic cargos are sorted into MVB luminal vesicles in a ubiquitin-dependent manner (reviewed in Ref. 2Katzmann D.J.

Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 649-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). In the endocytic pathway, many ubiquitinated transmembrane proteins have been reported to be endocytosed and delivered to MVB luminal vesicles for degradation in lysosomes in both yeast and mammalian cells (1Hicke L. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 2: 195-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (974) Google Scholar, 2Katzmann D.J. Odorizzi G. Emr S.D. Nat. Rev. Mol.

The endocytic pathway also involves many cytosolic adaptor proteins that often undergo ubiquitination. It is interesting to know what ubiquitinated proteins the GAT domain bind. The first possibility is that GGA might bind ubiquitinated transmembrane cargo proteins on TGN membranes and regulate their transport processes. In line with this possibility, the GAT-ubiquitin interaction is enhanced by ARF-GTP, which recruits GGAs onto membranes. Secondly, GGA might interact with another adaptor protein with ubiquitin modification to cooperate in trafficking processes. A third possibility is associated with our finding that, like other ubiquitin-binding proteins (30Polo S. Sigismund S. Faretta M. Guidi M. Capua M.R. Bossi G. Chen H. De Camilli P. Di Fiore P.P.

Because the GAT domain probably does not possess a ubiquitin-ligase (E3) activity, it might recruit a ubiquitin-E2 or ubiquitin-E3 intermediate. It is possible that the ubiquitin moiety appended to GGAs is recognized by another protein containing a ubiquitin-binding module. Our attempts to explore the physiological relevance of the GAT-ubiquitin interaction have been unsuccessful so far. For example, overexpression of GGA3 mutants defective in ubiquitin binding did not affect internalization or degradation of epidermal growth factor receptor, which is internalized and degraded in lysosomes in a ubiquitin-dependent manner (1Hicke L. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 2: 195-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (974) Google Scholar, 3Di Fiore P.P. Polo S. Hofmann K. Nat. Rev. Mol.

Loss of C/EBPα functions have been linked to leukemogenesis, suggesting an important role for C/EBPα as a tumor suppressor (22Gombart A.F. Hofmann W.-K. Kawano S. Takeuchi S. Krug U. Kwok S.H.

Different models involving both transcriptional and non-transcriptional mechanisms have been proposed to explain how C/EBPα causes arrest of the cell cycle. Initially, C/EBPα was found to enhance the expression and protein stability of the cyclin-dependent kinase (cdk) inhibitor p21 (20Timchenko N.A. Harris T.E. Wilde M. Bilyeu T.A. Burgess-Beusse B.L. Finegold M.J. Darlington G.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 7353-7361Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 27Timchenko N.A. Wilde M. Nakanishi M. Smith J.R. Darlington G.J. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 804-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). Furthermore, C/EBPα was suggested to directly inhibit the activity of cdks through interaction with p21 (12Harris T.E. Albrecht J.H. Nakanishi M. Darlington G.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 29200-29209Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). However, C/EBPα also causes proliferation arrest in p21-deficient fibroblasts (16Müller C. Alunni-Fabbroni M. Kowenz-Leutz E. Mo X. Tommasino M. Leutz A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 7276-7281Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), demanding additional mechanisms of proliferation inhibition. These may include the association of C/EBPα with cdk2 and cdk4 independently of p21 and the enhancement of proteolytic turnover of the cdks (28Wang H. Goode T. Iakova P. Albrecht J.H. Timchenko N.A. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 930-941Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 29Wang H. Iakova P. Wilde M. Welm A. Goode T. Roesler W.J. Timchenko N.A. Mol.

An alternative explanation for C/EBPα-mediated proliferation arrest proposes that C/EBPα counteracts the activation of E2F-dependent genes (14Johansen L.M. Iwama I. Lodie T.A. Sasaki K. Felsher D.W. Golub T.R. Tenen D.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 3789-3806Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar, 17Porse B.T. Pedersen T.A. Xu X. Lindberg B. Wewer U.M. Friis-Hansen L. Nerlov C.

Cell. 2003; 113: 495-506Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). This mechanism is particular attractive, as it was shown that both terminal differentiation and cell cycle arrest depend on E2F repression (17Porse B.T. Pedersen T.A. Xu X. Lindberg B. Wewer U.M. Friis-Hansen L. Nerlov C. Cell. 2001; 107: 247-258Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar), linking both events to one factor. Iakova et al. have recently suggested that C/EBPα-induced cell cycle arrest is caused by two different and competitive mechanisms that might change with age. In liver cells of young rodents, C/EBPα was found to be associated with cdk complexes, whereas in older animals a complex containing E2F4, the retinoblastoma protein (Rb) and the ATPase Brahma (Brm) prevailed as C/EBPα binding partners (30Iakova P. Awad S.S. Timchenko N.A. Cell. 2003; 113: 495-506Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Although this model combines different mechanisms of C/EBPα-induced proliferation arrest, it involves the tumor suppressor Rb that was previously shown to be dispensable for the proliferation inhibitory activity of C/EBPα (13Hendricks-Taylor L.R.

We have shown previously that the functional interaction between C/EBPα and the SWI/SNF chromatin-remodeling complex is essential for the activation of a set of myeloid and adipogenic genes and for cell differentiation (31Pedersen T.A. Kowenz-Leutz E. Leutz A. Nerlov C. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 3208-3216Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). The ATPases hBrm and Brg1, which are essential components of the mammalian SWI/SNF core complex, are also involved in cell cycle regulation (32Dunaief J.L. Strober B.E. Guha S. Khavari P.A. Alin K.

Here, we report that C/EBPα fails to induce cell cycle arrest in SWI/SNF-deficient cells. Proliferation arrest by C/EBPα, however, is re-established once a functional SWI/SNF complex is restored. Thus, our data suggest that C/EBPα-mediated proliferation arrest critically depends on a functional SWI/SNF complex. Plasmid Constructs—Rat C/EBPα constructs were cloned into pCDNA3 (Invitrogen). The generation of Δ126-200, Δ126-200 + CR1, and p30 have been described (31Pedersen T.A. Kowenz-Leutz E. Leutz A. Nerlov C.

An EcoRI fragment containing the rat C/EBPαER (21Umek R.M. Friedman A.D. McKnight S.L. Science. 1991; 251: 288-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar) was cloned into the pBABEpuro vector (42Morgenstern J.P. Land H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 3587-3596Crossref PubMed Scopus (1895) Google Scholar). EcoRI fragments of wild type or the ATP-binding site mutant of h-Brm (HA-tagged) (43Muchardt C. Yaniv M. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4279-4290Crossref PubMed Scopus (522) Google Scholar) were cloned into the pCDNA3 and pBABEpuro vectors. The Brahma and Ini1-specific small interfering RNA (siRNA) oligonucleotides were designed as described in (44Brummelkamp T.R. Bernards R. Agami R. Science. 2002; 296: 550-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (3949) Google Scholar) and are as follows: Brahma upper strand, 5′-GAT CCC CAA AGG ACC TTG CCT GGC ATT TCA AGA GAA TGC CAG GCA AGG TCC TTT TTT TTG AAA-3′, and Brahma lower strand, 5′-AGC TTT TCC AAA AAA AAG GAC CTT GCC TGG CAT TCT CTT GAA ATG CCA GGC AAG GTC CTT TGG G-3′); Ini1 upper strand, 5′-GAT CCC CCA CGG CCC CGG CCT GGT AAT TCA AGA GAT TAC CAG GCC GGG GCC GTG TTT TTG GAA A-3′, and Ini1 lower strand, 5′-AGC TTT TCC AAA AAC ACG GCC CCG GCC TGG TAA TCT CTT GAA TTA CCA GGC CGG GGC CGT GGG G-3′. The double-stranded oligonucleotides were cloned into BglII- and HindIII-digested pSUPER vector (44Brummelkamp T.R. Bernards R. Agami R. Science. 2002; 296: 550-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (3949) Google Scholar). Cell Culture—Cells were incubated in 5% CO2 at 37 °C. NIH3T3 (American Type Culture Collection), C33A, SW13, and Phoenix A cells in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Invitrogen) and BCER (BALB/c mouse fibroblasts expressing the C/EBPαER fusion protein) as described earlier (16Müller C. Alunni-Fabbroni M. Kowenz-Leutz E. Mo X. Tommasino M. Leutz A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 7276-7281Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Transfected or retrovirally infected cells were cultivated with puromycin (2 μg/ml) or G-418 (0.8 mg/ml). Transfection Methods and Colony Staining—For stable expression, cells (5 × 104) were transfected with 5 μg of DNA using calcium phosphate. Antibiotic-resistant colonies were pooled for protein expression analysis or fixed with 4% para-formaldehyde for 1 h and stained with Diff-Quick (Merz und Dade AG) to determine colony numbers. Gene Porter transfection reagent (Gene Therapy Systems) was used with 1 × 105 BCER cells and 10 μg of pSUPER-based vector plus 1 μg pBABEpuro in siRNA experiments. After 1-2 weeks of puromycin selection, single clones were isolated and analyzed for Brahma or Ini1 expression by Western blotting. For transient expression, 1 × 106 cells were transfected using calcium phosphate. 34-38 h later, cells were harvested. Reporter Assay—1 × 106 cells from C33A clones retrovirally infected with C/EBPαER-pBABEpuro or with the empty pBABEpuro were transfected with 1 μg of the C/EBP-responsive M82-luciferase construct as described earlier (45Sterneck E. Müller C. Katz S. Leutz A. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 115-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Transfection of each clone was done in parallel with four plates, two of which received β-estradiol (1 μm), whereas the other two received the solvent only. 36 h after transfection, cells were harvested for luciferase assay (45Sterneck E. Müller C. Katz S. Leutz A. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 115-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Retroviral Infection—Phoenix A cells were transiently transfected using calcium phosphate. 48 h after transfection, 5 × 105 target cells were infected and selected as described (46Pear W.S. Nolan G.P. Scott M.L. Baltimore D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8392-8396Crossref PubMed Scopus (2291) Google Scholar). Growth Curves—Cells (1 × 104 cells per well) were seeded in phenol red-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, and either β-estradiol (1 μm) or solvent was added. Every 24 h cells were harvested, and the number of living cells was determined by trypan blue exclusion. Western Blotting—Proteins were separated on 12, 10, or 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and blotted on polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Immobilon-P, Millipore). Proteins were detected using antibodies against C/EBPα (14AA), Brm (N-19 and C-20), Ini1 (H-300), and α-Tubulin (TU-02) (0.5 μg/ml each, all from Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc.), anti-HA (1:1000, Babco), and appropriate horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (anti-rabbit, 1:5000 and anti-mouse, 1:5000, both from Amersham Biosciences, and anti-goat, 1:2000, from Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc.) and detected by chemiluminescence (ECL, Amersham Biosciences). Alternatively, fluorochrome-conjugated secondary antibodies were used (goat anti-mouse IgG (H+L) and goat anti-rabbit IgG (H+L), both from Alexa Fluor, each in a dilution of 1:5000), and the blots were analyzed with the Odyssey-Imager (Li-COR). The anti-proliferative activity of C/EBPα and various C/EBPα mutants (Fig. 1A) was determined in a colony assay using mouse NIH3T3 fibroblasts and the SWI/SNF-defective human cell lines C33A and SW13 (43Muchardt C. Yaniv M. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4279-4290Crossref PubMed Scopus (522) Google Scholar). As shown in Table I, full-length C/EBPα (C/EBPα FL) inhibits colony formation in NIH3T3 but not in SWI/SNF-defective cells. Removal of the SWI/SNF interaction domain in the center of C/EBPα (C/EBPα Δ126-200) (31Pedersen T.A. Kowenz-Leutz E. Leutz A. Nerlov C. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 3208-3216Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar) largely abrogates the inhibitory effect on colony formation, suggesting a general contribution of SWI/SNF in C/EBPα-mediated proliferation arrest. Notably, when SWI/SNF recruitment of the internal deletion mutant was restored by adding the heterologous SWI/SNF recruiting domain of C/EBPβ (Δ126-200+CR1; CR1 was derived from the C/EBPβ N terminus; Refs. 31Pedersen T.A. Kowenz-Leutz E. Leutz A. Nerlov C. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 3208-3216Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar and 47Kowenz-Leutz E. Leutz A. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 735-743Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar), the ability to suppress colony formation in NIH3T3 cells was also restored. In SWI/SNF-defective cells the same chimeric C/EBP protein, like the full-length C/EBPα, fails to suppress proliferation. The C/EBPα p30 isoform, which lacks the major N-terminal transactivation function, has been shown previously to be defective in the activation of genes and the suppression of proliferation (17Porse B.T.

In a control experiment, C/EBPα p30 was expressed and found to be unable to inhibit proliferation in both NIH3T3- and SWI/SNF-defective cells (Table I).Table ISuppression of colony formation by C/EBP α depends on SWI/SNFNIH3T3C33ASW13Empty vector71.0 ± 3.6143.3 ± 9.3131.3 ± 8.2C/EBP α FL24.3 ± 4.9124 ± 7112.7 ± 8Δ 126-20053.3 ± 5130.6 ± 15.9NDΔ 126-200 + CR124.7 ± 2.1133.3 ± 11.9NDC/EBP α p3075.3 ± 7.7127.3 ± 6.8105 ± 12.2 Open table in a new tab A comparison of C/EBPα protein expression levels after transient and stable transfection in NIH3T3 fibroblasts and SWI/SNF-defective cells further supports the idea that C/EBPα-induced proliferation arrest depends on interaction with SWI/SNF. As shown in Fig. 1B, C/EBPα proteins are expressed at equal levels in NIH3T3 cells shortly after transfection (2 days). After 2 weeks, however, only traces of full-length C/EBPα or C/EBPα Δ126-200 + CR1 were found in NIH3T3 cells, suggesting counter selection, whereas expression of C/EBPα Δ126-200 and p30 remained high. In contrast, expression from all constructs was maintained in the SWI/SNF-defective C33A cells (Fig. 1B) or SW13 cells (data not shown), indicating that, in the absence of SWI/SNF, C/EBPα expression does not restrain proliferation. These results show that the SWI/SNF interaction domain of C/EBPα and a functional SWI/SNF complex are required for efficient induction of proliferation arrest. Furthermore, SWI/SNF-defective cells are the first cells identified that tolerate high levels of C/EBPα expression during proliferation. In addition to the SWI/SNF defect, C33A and SW13 cells might have accumulated other mutations that may help to overcome C/EBPα-induced proliferation arrest. To examine this possibility, SWI/SNF-defective cells were reconstituted with intact hBrm and with a conditional version of C/EBPα (16Müller C. Alunni-Fabbroni M. Kowenz-Leutz E. Mo X. Tommasino M. Leutz A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 7276-7281Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 21Umek R.M. Friedman A.D. McKnight S.L. Science. 1991; 251: 288-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar). First, the hormone-inducible C/EBPα estrogen receptor fusion protein, C/EBPαER, was introduced by retroviral gene transfer into C33A cells. After confirming the expression and transcriptional function of the C/EBPαER fusion protein by Western blotting and reporter assay (see “Experimental Procedures” for details) (45Sterneck E. Müller C. Katz S. Leutz A. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 115-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), proliferation was found to be insensitive to estrogen (data not shown). Stable expression of hBrm, however, rendered these cells sensitive to estrogen-induced proliferation arrest as shown in Fig. 2A (left panel). In contrast, expression of a dominant negative hBrm mutant (defective in its ATPase function; Refs. 43Muchardt C. Yaniv M. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4279-4290Crossref PubMed Scopus (522) Google Scholar and 49Khavari P.A. Pedersen C.L. Tamkun J.W. Mendel D.B. Crabtree G.R. Nature. 1993; 366: 170-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (533) Google Scholar) instead of wild type hBrm was unable to restore the anti-proliferative C/EBPα activity (Fig. 2A, right panel). Fig. 2B shows that C33A cells expressing hBrm in the absence of conditional C/EBPα are also not estrogen-sensitive, ruling out the possibility that hBrm mediates estrogen sensitivity independently of the C/EBPαER construct. Thus, failure of C/EBPα to arrest proliferation of C33A cells is due to the lack of the functional SWI/SNF ATPase Brm. Interestingly, C33A cells are also defective in the tumor suppressor Rb (50Scheffner M. Munger K. Byrne J.C. Howley P.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

BALB/c mouse fibroblasts that stably express the C/EBPαER protein were previously shown to respond to estrogen with proliferation arrest (BCER cells; Ref. 16Müller C. Alunni-Fabbroni M. Kowenz-Leutz E. Mo X. Tommasino M. Leutz A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 7276-7281Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). These cells were employed to independently assess the dependence on Brm and SWI/SNF for proliferation arrest in a different cell type. As shown in Fig. 3, expression of the dominant negative hBrm mutant abrogates estrogen-induced proliferation arrest in BCER cells. Thus, functional Brm, in conjunction with C/EBPα, is also required in BALB/c fibroblasts to inhibit proliferation. Similar results were obtained when Brm protein expression was knocked down by RNA interference in BCER cells, as shown in Fig. 4. A Brm-specific siRNA expressed from the pSUPER vector (44Brummelkamp T.R. Bernards R. Agami R. Science. 2002; 296: 550-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (3949) Google Scholar) diminished the Brm protein level and rendered BCER cells unresponsive to estrogen (Fig. 4A). Interestingly, knock-down of Brm was transient, and the protein reappeared after 3-5 weeks, probably because the interfering RNA, expressed from a non-selectable plasmid, was lost upon prolonged cultivation. As shown in Fig. 4B, the recurrence of endogenous Brm expression coincided with the restoration of C/EBPα-mediated proliferation arrest after estrogen induction. These results show that the transient down-regulation of Brm expression resulted in the reversible abrogation of C/EBPα-induced proliferation arrest. Brm is an essential component of a subgroup of SWI/SNF complexes, but it might also display proliferation control activity independently of the complex. To determine whether the SWI/SNF complex is required for C/EBPα-induced proliferation arrest, we knocked down expression of Ini1/SNF5, another essential SWI/SNF component (51Geng F. Cao Y. Laurent B.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 4311-4320Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 52Phelan M.L. Sif S. Narlikar G.J. Kingston R.E. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 247-253Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar), by RNA interference. Initially, 12 BCER clones were isolated that expressed reduced Ini1 protein levels, as examined by Western blotting (data not shown, and Fig. 5). Notably, all Ini1/SNF5 knock-down clones displayed significantly prolonged doubling times that might be due to enhancement of apoptosis in the absence of Ini1 (53Roberts C.W. Leroux M.M. Fleming M.D. Orkin S.H. Cancer Cell. 2002; 2: 415-425Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, the three clones that were further examined displayed strongly reduced to undetectable Ini1/SNF5 expression (a representative example is shown in Fig. 5) and also failed to respond to estrogen-induced proliferation arrest, whereas controls remained estrogen-sensitive (Fig. 5A). These results suggest that a functional SWI/SNF complex is required for C/EBPα to suppress proliferation. The full-length isoform of the transcription factor C/EBPα inhibits proliferation of many cell types, including cells that are defective in cell cycle control genes such as p53, Rb and related pocket proteins, or p21 (11Freytag S.O.

Genetic defects on both alleles that interfere with the expression of the full-length C/EBPα isoform were observed in a substantial fraction of patients with acute myeloid leukemia, suggesting a tumor suppressor function for C/EBPα (22Gombart A.F. Hofmann W.-K. Kawano S. Takeuchi S. Krug U. Kwok S.H. Larsen R.J. Asou H. Miller C.W. Hoelzer D. Koeffler H.P. Blood. 2002; 99: 1332-1340Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar, 24Pabst T.

Various mechanisms that are difficult to reconcile have been proposed to explain how C/EBPα inhibits proliferation (see the Introduction). We have therefore carried out a functional analysis to examine the essential requirements for C/EBPα-mediated proliferation arrest. We find that, in the absence of a functional SWI/SNF complex, C/EBPα no longer suppresses proliferation. Consequently, the Brm-deficient C33A and SW13 tumor cells (43Muchardt C. Yaniv M. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4279-4290Crossref PubMed Scopus (522) Google Scholar) are the first cell lines identified that tolerate stable expression of high levels of C/EBPα during replication. Importantly, we could restore the anti-proliferative C/EBPα function in C33A cells by ectopic expression of hBrm. This ruled out the possibility that other defects that might have accumulated in the tumor cell line contributed to the loss of the anti-proliferative activity of C/EBPα. The strict SWI/SNF dependence of C/EBPα-mediated proliferation arrest was also found in BALB/c mouse fibroblasts. Reducing functional Brm levels by RNA interference or through competitive ectopic expression of a dominant negative Brm mutant resulted in loss of C/EBPα-mediated proliferation arrest. Because the knock-down of Brm by siRNA in BALB/c cells was only transient, we also obtained a rigorous and conditional control that linked C/EBPα-mediated proliferation arrest to endogenous Brm expression. Furthermore, we did not detect any residual anti-proliferative activity of C/EBPα in the investigated cells in the absence of Brm/SWI/SNF. Hence, our data imply that Brm and/or SWI/SNF is involved in all the mechanisms proposed to mediate C/EBPα-induced proliferation arrest. In addition to its function in the SWI/SNF complex, Brm might also be involved in the regulation of the cell cycle through other mechanisms. Although we can not rule out the possibility that multiple Brm-based mechanisms are simultaneously involved in C/EBPα-mediated cell cycle arrest, it is intriguing that elimination of Ini1/SNF5, another essential component of the SWI/SNF complex (51Geng F. Cao Y. Laurent B.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 4311-4320Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 52Phelan M.L. Sif S. Narlikar G.J. Kingston R.E. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 247-253Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar), also abrogated the anti-proliferative C/EBPα activity. The data therefore suggest that a Brm-based SWI/SNF complex is involved in C/EBPα-induced proliferation arrest. In a subset of mammalian SWI/SNF complexes, Brg1 is the ATPase subunit instead of Brm (49Khavari P.A. Pedersen C.L. Tamkun J.W. Mendel D.B. Crabtree G.R. Nature. 1993; 366: 170-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (533) Google Scholar, 54Chiba H. Muramatsu M. Nomoto A. Kato H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 1815-1820Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). Brm and Brg1 are highly homologous proteins and were found to be at least partially redundant in the regulation of the cell cycle in several studies in cell culture (32Dunaief J.L. Strober B.E.

However, the knock-out of Brg1 or Brm in mice produce different phenotypes that indicate differences in their function (33Reyes J.C. Barra J. Muchardt C. Camus A. Babinet C. Yaniv M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6979-6991Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar, 38Bultman S. Gebuhr T. Yee D. La Manita C. Nicholson J. Gilliam A. Randazzo F. Metzger D. Chambon P. Crabtree G.R. Magnuson T. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 1287-1295Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (666) Google Scholar). We and others have observed that C/EBPs may interact with both Brm- and Brg1-based SWI/SNF complexes to activate differentiation-specific genes (31Pedersen T.A. Kowenz-Leutz E. Leutz A. Nerlov C. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 3208-3216Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 47Kowenz-Leutz E. Leutz A. Mol.

Cell. 2003; 11: 377-389Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). This raises the question of whether Brg1 is also able to cooperate with C/EBPα for its proliferation-suppressing function. In the present study, the down-regulation of Brm in BALB/c fibroblasts was sufficient to abrogate C/EBPα-mediated cell cycle arrest, although the expression of Brg1 was not affected by the Brm-specific siRNA (data not shown). This suggests that Brg1 can not substitute for Brm in the anti-proliferative C/EBPα-SWI/SNF complex, pointing at a Brm-specific role in proliferation arrest. Experiments designed to address a role of Brg1 directly, however, failed because C33A cells that stably express Brg1 could not be obtained, probably because of cell toxicity, as was also observed by others (32Dunaief J.L. Strober B.E. Guha S. Khavari P.A. Alin K. Luban J. Begemann M. Crabtree G.R. Goff S.P. Cell. 1994; 79: 119-130Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (551) Google Scholar). The possible existence of SWI/SNF complexes with different compositions that interact with C/EBPα brings up the question of whether differentiation and proliferation are controlled by the same or by different C/EBPα-SWI/SNF complexes. Of note in this context are data from our previous study showing that C/EBPα-induced proliferation arrest and differentiation can be uncoupled from each other by human papilloma virus E7 oncoproteins from the high malignancy strains HPV16 and HPV18 (16Müller C. Alunni-Fabbroni M. Kowenz-Leutz E. Mo X. Tommasino M. Leutz A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 7276-7281Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). These oncogenes are also the only ones identified to date that overcome C/EBPα-mediated proliferation arrest, and they do so in a Rb/pocket protein-independent fashion. Furthermore, we observed that abrogation of C/EBPα-mediated proliferation arrest by HPV16E7 simultaneously enhanced C/EBPα-induced differentiation (16Müller C. Alunni-Fabbroni M. Kowenz-Leutz E. Mo X. Tommasino M. Leutz A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 7276-7281Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). A tempting hypothesis, therefore, is that E7 interferes with the function of a “proliferation control SWI/SNF complex” to the benefit of a “differentiation control SWI/SNF complex.” Brm as well as Brg1 interact with the tumor suppressor Rb, and both are involved in Rb-mediated proliferation arrest (32Dunaief J.L.

Cell. 2000; 101: 79-89Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (539) Google Scholar). C/EBPα can also interact with Rb (59Chen P.-L. Riley D.J. Chen Y. Lee W.-H. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2794-2804Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar), and a complex comprising C/EBPα, Rb, E2F4, and Brm was suggested to repress E2F target genes (30Iakova P. Awad S.S. Timchenko N.A. Cell. 2003; 113: 495-506Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). However, a C/EBPα mutant that lacks its Rb interaction domain is still proliferation inhibitory (17Porse B.T. Pedersen T.A. Xu X. Lindberg B. Wewer U.M. Friis-Hansen L. Nerlov C. Cell. 2001; 107: 247-258Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). Furthermore, C/EBPα efficiently induces proliferation arrest also in Rb-deficient cells (13Hendricks-Taylor L.R. Darlington G.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 4726-4733Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 14Johansen L.M. Iwama I. Lodie T.A. Sasaki K. Felsher D.W. Golub T.R. Tenen D.G. Mol. Cell.

Biol. 2000; 20: 5986-5997Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). We could restore the anti-proliferative potential of C/EBPα in C33A cells that lack functional Rb solely through ectopic expression of Brm. Therefore, our data support the view that Rb is not an essential requirement for C/EBPα-mediated proliferation arrest. A particularity of C/EBPα is that full-length and truncated (p30) isoforms are expressed through differential translation initiation (41Calkhoven C.F. Müller C. Leutz A. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1920-1932PubMed Google Scholar, 60Ossipow V. Descombes P. Schibler U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8219-8223Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). Several studies have demonstrated that the C/EBPα p30 isoform, which lacks the major transactivation domain, fails to suppress proliferation (17Porse B.T. Pedersen T.A. Xu X. Lindberg B. Wewer U.M. Friis-Hansen L. Nerlov C. Cell. 2001; 107: 247-258Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar, 41Calkhoven C.F. Müller C. Leutz A.

Nevertheless, the C/EBPα p30 isoform can still interact with SWI/SNF (31Pedersen T.A. Kowenz-Leutz E. Leutz A. Nerlov C. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 3208-3216Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Therefore, a supplementary transcriptional activity may be required for effective induction of proliferation arrest by the full-length C/EBPα. Alternatively, additional functions, such as inhibition of E2F-mediated transcription (17Porse B.T. Pedersen T.A. Xu X. Lindberg B. Wewer U.M. Friis-Hansen L. Nerlov C. Cell. 2001; 107: 247-258Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar), may reside in the transactivation domain that still have to be explored in greater detail. In summary, data presented here and elsewhere suggest that both proliferation and differentiation control by C/EBPα are tightly associated with SWI/SNF functions.

In this study, the mechanism(s) by which deoxycholic acid (DCA) activates the JNK pathway were examined. FAS receptor (FAS-R) and acidic sphingomyelinase (ASM)-deficient hepatocytes were resistant to DCA-induced activation of the JNK pathway. Activation of the JNK pathway (2-3-fold) in response to tumor necrosis factor-α was similar in both wild-type and FAS-R-/- hepatocytes. In wild-type and FAS-R-/- hepatocytes, ceramide elevation was detected as early as 2 min and peaked at 10 min after DCA treatment. In contrast, ASM-/- hepatocytes were defective in DCA-induced ceramide generation. Treatment with DCA resulted in movement of FAS-R to the cell surface, which was blocked upon treatment with brefeldin A. However, brefeldin A failed to block DCA-mediated JNK activation in wild-type hepatocytes. DCA-induced JNK activation was independent of either the epidermal growth factor receptor activation or free radical generation. Addition of ASM to rat hepatocytes activated JNK and down-regulated CYP7A1 mRNA levels. In conclusion, these results show that DCA activates JNK and represses CYP7A1 mRNA levels in primary hepatocytes via an ASM/FAS-R-dependent mechanism that is independent of either the epidermal growth factor receptor or free radical generation.

Bile acids are steroid molecules that are synthesized from cholesterol in the liver. They function as important regulators of cholesterol metabolism in the hepatocyte by modulating the expression of genes encoding cholesterol-degrading enzymes (bile acid biosynthetic enzymes) as well as cholesterol and phospholipid transport proteins (1Vlahcevic Z.R.

Studies from our laboratories have demonstrated that activation of the JNK pathway by bile acids plays a pivotal role in regulating cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase (CYP7A1) gene expression, the rate-limiting enzyme in the neutral pathway of bile acid biosynthesis (17Gupta S. Stravitz R.T. Dent P. Hylemon P.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 15816-15822Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). We have shown that activation of this pathway leads to induction of the repressor protein SHP (small heterodimer partner), which interacts with the transcription factor liver receptor homolog 1, a known positive regulator of CYP7A1, and represses its transcriptional activity. A similar network of nuclear receptor interactions for feedback repression of CYP7A1 has also been described for the bile acid receptor, farnesoid X receptor (22Lu T.T. Makishima M. Repa J.J.

Cell. 2000; 6: 517-526Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1453) Google Scholar). Recent studies show that cholic acid feeding in both wild-type and SHP knock-out mice increases the levels of the active, phosphorylated JNK in vivo (19Wang L. Lee Y.K. Bundman D. Han Y. Thevananther S. Kim C.S. Chua S.S. Wei P. Heyman R.A. Karin M. Moore D.D. Dev. Cell. 2002; 2: 721-731Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar). Furthermore, it was shown that treatment of primary hepatocytes from wild-type and SHP-/- mice with the JNK inhibitor, SP600125, increases the basal expression levels of CYP7A1. However, additional studies in SHP knock-out mice also demonstrate the existence of other JNK-dependent but SHP-independent pathways regulating CYP7A1. It has been reported that bile acids can also feedback-regulate CYP7A1 transcription through the nuclear receptor hepatocyte nuclear factor-4α (18De Fabiani E. Mitro N. Anzulovich A.C. Pinelli A. Galli G. Crestani M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30708-30716Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Activation of the MEKK1/JNK pathway by bile acids has been shown to decrease the trans-activation potential of hepatocyte nuclear factor-4α, thereby down-regulating CYP7A1 transcription. Bile acids have also been shown to be able to activate liver macrophage cytokine production that can then initiate a cascade that activates JNK in the hepatocyte, a process that decreases the transcriptional activation of CYP7A1 (24Miyake J.H. Wang S.L. Davis R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21805-21808Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). More recently, the nuclear bile acid receptor farnesoid X receptor was shown to regulate directly the expression of fibroblast growth factor-19, a secreted growth factor that signals through the receptor tyrosine kinase, fibroblast growth factor receptor-4 (25Holt J.A. Luo G. Billin A.N. Bisi J. McNeill Y.Y. Kozarsky K.F. Donahee M. Wang D.Y. Mansfield T.A. Kliewer S.A. Goodwin B. Jones S.A. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 1581-1591Crossref PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar). In turn, activated fibroblast growth factor receptor-4 repressed CYP7A1 gene expression via a JNK-dependent pathway. Collectively, the above studies clearly underscore the importance of the JNK signaling pathway in regulation of CYP7A1 gene expression by bile acids. However, the molecular events by which bile acids activate this pathway in hepatocytes have not yet been fully elucidated. In other studies, we have shown that low concentrations of DCA cause activation of the Raf-1/MEK/ERK signaling cascade via activation of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) (10Qiao L. Studer E. Leach K. McKinstry R. Gupta S. Decker R. Kukreja R. Valerie K. Nagarkatti P. El Deiry W. Molkentin J. Schmidt-Ullrich R. Fisher P.B. Grant S. Hylemon P.B. Dent P. Mol. Biol.

Hepatology. 2002; 35: 307-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Activation of this pathway was found to be a protective response of primary hepatocytes to DCA, as a blockade of DCA-induced ERK1/2 activation dramatically increased apoptosis ∼8-fold within 6 h of exposure. Apoptosis was dependent on bile acid-induced, ligand-independent activation of the FAS death receptor (FAS-R; CD95). Studies by other groups (7Graf D. Kurz A.K. Fischer R. Reinehr R. Haussinger D. Gastroenterology. 2002; 122: 1411-1427Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 8Faubion W.A. Guicciardi M.E. Miyoshi H. Bronk S. Roberts P.J. Svingen P.A. Kaufmann S.H.

Physiol. 2000; 278: G992-G999Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) indicate that toxic bile acids can activate FAS-R by directly increasing its cell surface density via induction of FAS-R trafficking to the plasma membrane. The increased density of cell surface FAS-R likely promotes its oligomerization, formation of a death-inducing signal complex, and subsequent induction of apoptosis. Both PKC and JNK have been implicated in FAS-R trafficking to the plasma membrane (7Graf D. Kurz A.K. Fischer R. Reinehr R. Haussinger D. Gastroenterology. 2002; 122: 1411-1427Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 9Sodeman T. Bronk S.F. Roberts P.J. Miyoshi H. Gores G.J. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 278: G992-G999Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, PKC and JNK may have multiple targets in the apoptotic cascade. More recent studies (26Brenner D.A. Hepatology. 1998; 13: S93-S95Google Scholar, 27Liedtke C. Plumpe J. Kubicka S. Bradham C.A. Manns M.P. Brenner D.A. Trautwein C.

Chem. 1998; 273: 10232-10239Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar) have suggested that JNK signaling may have both pro- and anti-apoptosis signaling effects in hepatocytes. Indeed, studies from our laboratory demonstrate that bile acid-induced activation of the FAS receptor can generate opposing signals, receptor-induced JNK1 activation, resulting in cell death, and receptor-induced JNK2 activation, resulting in protection and metabolism regulation (12Qiao L. Song I.H. Youwen F. Park J.S. Gupta S. Gilfor D. Amorino G. Valerie K. Sealy L. Engelhardt J.F. Grant S. Hylemon P.B. Dent P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 3052-3066Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Hence, depending upon the concentration, structure, and conjugation state of the bile acid being presented to the hepatocyte, it can either initiate an apoptotic response or promote cell survival via an interaction of multiple signaling pathways and transcription factors. Clustering or aggregation of cell surface receptor molecules upon ligand binding has been reported for a variety of receptors, including tumor necrosis factor (29Natoli G. Costanzo A. Guido F.

Graf G.A. McNiven M.A. Sessa W.C. Engelman J.A. Scherer P.E. Okamoto T. Lisanti M.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7289-7304Crossref PubMed Scopus (917) Google Scholar). Evidence suggests that membrane rafts are the specific sites for ceramide generation in response to various agonists and stress signals (42Cremesti A.E. Goni F.M. Kolesnick R. FEBS Lett. 2002; 531: 47-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). Cellular ceramide is generated either by hydrolysis of sphingomyelin or by de novo biosynthesis (43Kolesnick R.N. Kronke M. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1998; 60: 643-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (722) Google Scholar). Sphingomyelin hydrolysis can be catalyzed by at least three different sphingomyelinases: acid (ASM), neutral (NSM), and alkaline sphingomyelinases. The current model of FAS-R signaling suggests that engagement of FAS-R by its ligand or anti-Fas antibody results in translocation of ASM from an intracellular pool to the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane to hydrolyze sphingomyelin and release ceramide in membrane rafts (32Grassme H. Jekle A. Riehle A. Schwarz H. Berger J. Sandhoff K. Kolesnick R. Gulbins E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 20589-20596Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar, 34Grassme H. Cremesti A. Kolesnick R. Gulbins E. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 5457-5470Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). Local release of ceramide in these rafts results in the reorganization of rafts into larger platforms within which FAS-R aggregates and clusters. Clustering of FAS-R appears to facilitate oligomerization of downstream FAS effectors, bringing it in close contact with other signaling molecules and/or excluding inhibitory signaling mechanisms, all of which promote FAS-mediated signaling. Modification of rafts by ceramide, generated via activation of ASM, has also been shown to play an important role in non-apoptotic signaling pathways that require clustering of specific receptors (44Gulbins E. Kolesnick R. Quinn P.J. Kagan V.E. Subcellular Biochemistry: Phospholipid Metabolism in Apoptosis. Vol. 36. Kluwer Academic/Plenum Publishers, New York2002: 229-244Google Scholar). Furthermore, rafts altered by ASM activation may be involved in non-receptor-mediated signaling. Activation of the FAS and TNF receptor by stress stimuli (irradiation, heat shock, or UV light) has been observed to occur independently of the FAS ligand or TNF, respectively (44Gulbins E. Kolesnick R. Quinn P.J. Kagan V.E. Subcellular Biochemistry: Phospholipid Metabolism in Apoptosis. Vol. 36. Kluwer Academic/Plenum Publishers, New York2002: 229-244Google Scholar, 45Rehemtulla A.

Res. 2003; 47: 393-399Crossref Scopus (132) Google Scholar). It has been proposed that some stress stimuli might alter the conformation of FAS-R or change the composition of rafts permitting trapping of unliganded FAS-R molecules. This may result in low level receptor activation sufficient to initiate intracellular signaling. In the present studies, we show that expression of the FAS receptor in primary hepatocytes is critically involved in activation of the JNK pathway by bile acids. Moreover, ceramide generated by ASM seems to be a key player in JNK activation in hepatocytes. These data provide a mechanistic basis for the activation of the JNK pathway by physiologic concentrations of bile acids via activation of ASM and generation of ceramide.

N-Octyl-β-d-glucopyranoside and [γ-32P]ATP were supplied by ICN Biomedicals Inc. (Costa Mesa, CA). Primary Hepatocyte Cultures—Primary rat hepatocyte monolayer cultures were prepared from male Harlan Sprague-Dawley rats (200-300 g) using the collagenase-perfusion technique of Bissell and Guzelian (48Bissell D.M. Guzelian P.S. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1980; 349: 85-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). Hepatocytes were plated on collagen-coated culture dishes in serum-free William's E medium containing penicillin (100 units/ml), dexamethasone (0.1 μm), and thyroxine (1 μm). Before plating, cells were judged to be greater than 90% viable using trypan blue exclusion. Cells were routinely incubated for 22 h at 37 °C in humidified 5% CO2. Mouse hepatocytes were isolated from lymphoproliferative (lpr; FAS-/-) (a gift from Dr. Prakash Nagarkatti, Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology, Virginia Commonwealth University, Richmond, VA) and wild-type (C57BL/6) male mice or from male ASM knock-out mice (a gift from Dr. Richard Kolesnick, Laboratory of Signal Transduction, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York), maintained in an sv129 × C57BL/6 background, propagated using heterozygous breeding pairs, and genotyped as described previously (49Paris F.

Experimental mice were 8-12-weeks-old when sacrificed. JNK Activity Assay—After treatments, hepatocytes (8.5 × 105 cells/35-mm dish) were washed with ice-cold PBS followed by homogenization in cold lysis buffer (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 5 mm EDTA, 5 mm EGTA, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 0.05% SDS, 0.05% sodium deoxycholate, 1% Triton X-100, 5 mm NaF, 0.1% 2-mercaptoethanol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μm microcystin-LR, and 40 μg/ml each of pepstatin A, aprotinin, and leupeptin). Cell supernatants (400 μg) were incubated with 1 μg of anti-JNK1 antibody at 4 °C for 2-3 h. The immune complexes were isolated by the addition of protein A-agarose beads. The immunoprecipitates were recovered by centrifugation and washed (10 min) sequentially with lysis buffer, PBS, and kinase assay buffer (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 15 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm Na3VO4, and 0.1% (v/v) 2-mercaptoethanol). JNK activity was determined by incubating the washed immunoprecipitates in a reaction mixture containing 40 μl of kinase assay buffer, 0.1 mm ATP, 1 μm microcystin-LR, 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP, and 10 μg of recombinant GST-c-Jun (amino acids 1-169) for 20 min at 37 °C. Reactions were terminated by adding 5× SDS-PAGE sample buffer and boiling for 5 min. Phosphorylated GST-c-Jun was resolved in 10% SDS-PAGE and the gels dried and autoradiographed, and the radioactivity incorporated in GST-c-Jun was determined by laser scanning the autoradiograms. Measurement of JNK activity upon addition of either DCA or TNF-α in primary cultures of rat or mouse hepatocytes revealed a species-specific difference in JNK response, with primary rat hepatocytes showing a more robust activation of JNK as compared with primary mouse hepatocytes (Table I).Table IJNK activity in primary rat and mouse hepatocytesTreatmentaPrimary hepatocytes were treated with DCA (50 μm; 60 min) or TNF-α (10 ng/ml; 20 min), and JNK activity was determined as described under “Experimental Procedures.”JNK activity% controlbValues are mean ± S.E., n = 3-4.

Spiegel S. Glycoconj. J. 1992; 9: 110-117PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, hepatocytes were washed with PBS and scraped into 1 ml of cold methanol containing 2.5 μl of concentrated HCl. Lipids were extracted by adding 2 ml of chloroform, 1 m NaCl (1:1, v/v), and phases were separated. An aliquot (100 μl) of the chloroform phase was dried under nitrogen gas. Bovine brain type III ceramide was used as a standard. The enzymatic reaction was started by the addition of 100 μl of 50 mm imidazole, 1 mm diethylenetriaminepenta acetic acid, 12.5 mm MgCl2, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm EGTA, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm ATP, 1.5% N-octyl-β-d-glucopyranoside, 1 mm cardiolipin, DAG kinase (0.01 unit), and [γ-32P]ATP (1 μCi). After incubation at 37 °C for 35 min with 15 min of sonication at room temperature in between, lipids were extracted by the addition of 500 μl of chloroform:methanol:HCl (100:100:1) and 100 μl of 1 m NaCl. Labeled ceramide 1-phosphate and phosphatidic acid (50-μl organic layer) were resolved by TLC with chloroform:acetone:methanol:acetic acid:water (10:4:3:2:1). Bands corresponding to ceramide were quantified with a Bio-Rad PhosphorImager.

After treatment, the cells were washed with PBS and fixed in cold methanol:acetone (1:1) for 10 min at -20 °C. After washing three times in PBS for 5 min each, the cells were blocked in 0.5% bovine serum albumin in PBS for 30 min at room temperature and incubated with the primary antibody, Jo2, diluted in PBS, 0.5% bovine serum albumin (1:500) overnight at 4 °C.

https://openalex.org/W2118625310,"The cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) protein is a cAMP-regulated Cl- channel expressed at the apical plasma membrane. It has been proposed that the C-terminal PDZ binding motif of CFTR is required for its apical membrane targeting and that PDZ-domain interactions may tether CFTR to the actin cytoskeleton via soluble proteins including EBP50/NHERF1 and ezrin. We measured the diffusional mobility of human CFTR in the plasma membrane of Madin-Darby canine kidney cells by photobleaching of green fluorescent protein (GFP)-CFTR chimeras. After bleaching by a focused laser beam, GFP-CFTR fluorescence in the bleached membrane region recovered to approximately 90% of its initial level, indicating that nearly all of the CFTR was mobile. The GFP-CFTR diffusion coefficient (D) was 0.99 +/- 0.09 x 10(-10) cm2/s at 37 degrees C, similar to that of other membrane proteins. GFP-CFTR diffusion was not altered by protein kinase A or C activators but was blocked by paraformaldehyde and filipin. CFTR mutants lacking functional PDZ-binding domains (GFPCFTR-DeltaTRL and GFP-CFTR-DeltaTRA) were also mobile with D significantly increased by approximately 60% compared with GFP-CFTR. However, GFP-CFTR, GFP-CFTR-Delta TRL, and GFP-CFTR-DeltaTRA had similar mobilities (D approximately 12 x 10(-10) cm2/s) at the endoplasmic reticulum in brefeldin A-treated cells. Agents that modulate the actin cytoskeleton (cytochalasin D and jasplakinolide) altered the plasma membrane mobility of CFTR but not CFTR- DeltaTRL. EBP50 (NHERF1), a PDZ domain-containing protein that interacts with the C terminus of CFTR, diffused freely in the cytoplasm with a diffusion coefficient of 0.9 +/- 0.1 x 10(-7) cm2/s. EBP50 diffusion increased by approximately 2-fold after deletion of its ezrin-binding domain. These results indicate that wild-type CFTR is not tethered statically at the plasma membrane but that its diffusion is dependent on PDZ-domain interactions and an intact actin skeleton. PDZ-domain interactions of CFTR are thus dynamic and occur on a time scale of seconds or faster."
https://openalex.org/W2005218056,"Insig-1 is an intrinsic protein of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) that regulates the proteolytic processing of membrane-bound sterol regulatory element-binding proteins (SREBPs), transcription factors that activate the synthesis of cholesterol and fatty acids in mammalian cells. When cellular levels of sterols rise, Insig-1 binds to the membranous sterol-sensing domain of SREBP cleavage-activating protein (SCAP), retaining the SCAP/SREBP complex in the ER and preventing it from moving to the Golgi for proteolytic processing. Under conditions of sterol excess, Insig-1 also binds to the ER enzyme 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG CoA) reductase, facilitating its ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation. Here, we use protease protection, glycosylation site mapping, and cysteine derivitization to define the topology of the 277-amino acid human Insig-1. The data indicate that short segments at the N and C termini of Insig-1 face the cytosol. Most of the protein is buried within the membrane, forming six transmembrane segments separated by five short luminal and cytosolic loops that range from ∼5 to 16 amino acids. The membranous nature of Insig-1 is consistent with its sterol-dependent binding to hydrophobic sterol-sensing domains in SCAP and HMG CoA reductase. Insig-1 is an intrinsic protein of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) that regulates the proteolytic processing of membrane-bound sterol regulatory element-binding proteins (SREBPs), transcription factors that activate the synthesis of cholesterol and fatty acids in mammalian cells. When cellular levels of sterols rise, Insig-1 binds to the membranous sterol-sensing domain of SREBP cleavage-activating protein (SCAP), retaining the SCAP/SREBP complex in the ER and preventing it from moving to the Golgi for proteolytic processing. Under conditions of sterol excess, Insig-1 also binds to the ER enzyme 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG CoA) reductase, facilitating its ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation. Here, we use protease protection, glycosylation site mapping, and cysteine derivitization to define the topology of the 277-amino acid human Insig-1. The data indicate that short segments at the N and C termini of Insig-1 face the cytosol. Most of the protein is buried within the membrane, forming six transmembrane segments separated by five short luminal and cytosolic loops that range from ∼5 to 16 amino acids. The membranous nature of Insig-1 is consistent with its sterol-dependent binding to hydrophobic sterol-sensing domains in SCAP and HMG CoA reductase. Insig-1 and Insig-2 were recently identified as membrane proteins that reside in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) 1The abbreviations used are: ER, endoplasmic reticulum; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; CMV, cytomegalovirus; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; endo H, endoglycosidase H; HEK, human embryonic fibroblasts; MTSET, 2-(trimethylammonium)ethyl methanethiosulfonate bromide; PNGase F, peptide N-glycosidase F; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; SCAP, SREBP cleavage-activating protein; SREBP, sterol regulatory element-binding protein; TK, thymidine kinase. 1The abbreviations used are: ER, endoplasmic reticulum; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; CMV, cytomegalovirus; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; endo H, endoglycosidase H; HEK, human embryonic fibroblasts; MTSET, 2-(trimethylammonium)ethyl methanethiosulfonate bromide; PNGase F, peptide N-glycosidase F; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; SCAP, SREBP cleavage-activating protein; SREBP, sterol regulatory element-binding protein; TK, thymidine kinase. and play a central role in the regulation of cholesterol and fatty acid synthesis (1Yang T.

When cellular cholesterol levels are elevated, Insigs bind to SCAP and 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase (HMG CoA reductase) through interactions with the sequence-related sterol-sensing domains in the membrane-spanning regions of each protein. In the case of SCAP, Insig binding prevents movement of the SREBP/SCAP complex from the ER to the Golgi, thus blocking proteolytic cleavage and transcriptional activation of SREBP (1Yang T.

In the case of HMG CoA reductase, Insig binding promotes ubiquitination and degradation, thus slowing the rate-limiting enzymatic reaction in cholesterol synthesis (3Sever N. Song B.-L. Yabe D.

Goldstein J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 11041-11048Crossref PubMed Scopus (1093) Google Scholar). The C terminus of SREBP binds to the C terminus of SCAP, the protein that transports SREBPs from the ER to the Golgi when cells are depleted of sterols. Within the Golgi, two resident proteases cleave SREBP through regulated intramembrane proteolysis (Rip), releasing the N terminus of SREBP from the membrane and allowing it to translocate to the nucleus and activate transcription of target genes (6Brown M.S. Ye J. Rawson R.B. Goldstein J.L. Cell. 2000; 100: 391-398Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1141) Google Scholar).In the presence of sterols, SCAP undergoes a conformational change, causing the SCAP/SREBP complex to be retained in the ER and thus abrogating SREBP-dependent transcription. Insig proteins have been found to facilitate both the ER retention of the SCAP/SREBP complex (1Yang T. Espenshade P.J. Wright M.E. Yabe D. Gong Y. Aebersold R. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S.

A. 2003; 100: 10647-10652Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). These activities of Insig occur via an interaction with the sterol-sensing domain of SCAP, which comprises transmembrane segments 2-6. The sterol-dependent interaction between SCAP and Insig is abolished by point mutations in the membranous portion of SCAP (1Yang T. Espenshade P.J. Wright M.E. Yabe D. Gong Y. Aebersold R.

Brown M.S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2002; 397: 139-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar).Insig proteins also regulate the ER enzyme HMG CoA reductase, which produces mevalonate, the precursor of cholesterol and nonsterol isoprenoids (9Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Nature. 1990; 343: 425-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (4500) Google Scholar). Overexpression of the sterol-sensing domain of SCAP prevents the sterol-accelerated, Insig-mediated degradation of HMG CoA reductase (4Sever N. Yang T. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. DeBose-Boyd R.A. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 25-33Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar), suggesting that the two proteins bind to the same site on Insigs. The sterol-stimulated binding of HMG CoA reductase to Insig is required for sterol-dependent degradation of the enzyme, as evidenced by the failure of this regulatory process in cells that have been treated with RNAi that target Insig-1 plus Insig-2 (3Sever N.

They demonstrate an amino acid identity of 59%, the differences confined mostly to the hydrophilic N- and C-terminal regions. Insig-2 lacks the N-terminal 50 amino acids of Insig-1. These structural differences are highly conserved across species. Insig-1 and Insig-2 are functionally similar in that both can cause the ER retention of the SCAP/SREBP complex (1Yang T.

Insig-1 expression is positively controlled by nuclear SREBPs, while Insig-2 expression is negatively regulated by insulin (10Yabe D. Komuro R. Liang G. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Sequence inspection suggests that Insig proteins are polytopic membrane-spanning proteins with a high proportion of hydrophobic residues. They are believed to interact with SCAP and HMG CoA reductase through binding to the polytopic membrane-spanning segments of these proteins. Transmembrane segments 2-6 of HMG CoA reductase show clear sequence identities to the sterol-sensing domain of SCAP (3Sever N. Song B.-L. Yabe D. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. DeBose-Boyd R.A. J. Biol.

The data are consistent with a model in which Insig-1 contains six membrane-spanning helices separated by very short hydrophilic loops and flanked by short hydrophilic N- and C-terminal extensions that protrude into the cytosol.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—We obtained (2Yabe D.

Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 12753-12758Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar).pCMV-MycX3-Insig-1 encodes a fusion protein consisting of an initiator methionine, three tandem copies of the c-Myc epitope tag, and amino acids 2-277 of human Insig-1 under control of the CMV promoter. To generate this plasmid, a fragment encoding a BspDI restriction site, amino acids 2-277 of human Insig-1, a stop codon (TGA), and a NotI restriction site was amplified by PCR using pCMV-Insig-1-MycX6 (2Yabe D. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 12753-12758Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar) as a template, and digested with BspDI and NotI. Forward and reverse primers used for PCR were as follows: 5′-ATGGTATCGATCCCAGATTGCACGACCACTTCTGG-3′ and 5′-TTGCTCAGAGCGGCCGCCTCAATCACTATGGGGCTTTTCAGGAAC-3′ (underlines denote BspDI and NotI sites, respectively). The resulting BspDI-NotI fragment was introduced into pcDNA3 vector between HindIII and NotI sites with a fragment encoding a HindIII restriction site, three tandem copies of the c-Myc epitope tag, and a BspDI restriction site.pCMV-Insig-1-MycX3 encodes a fusion protein consisting of amino acids 1-277 of human Insig-1, followed by three copies of the c-Myc epitope tag under control of the CMV promoter. To generate this plasmid, a BamHI-NotI fragment containing the coding region of human Insig-1 (amino acids 1-277) was released from pCMV-Insig-1-MycX6 (2Yabe D. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 12753-12758Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar). The resulting BamHI-NotI fragment was introduced into pcDNA3 vector between the BamHI and NotI sites. Then, a fragment encoding a NotI site, three tandem copies of the c-Myc epitope tag, a stop codon (TGA), and a XbaI site were introduced between the NotI and XbaI sites of the newly created plasmid.FLAG versions A-D of pCMV-Insig-1-MycX3 encode proteins similar to wild type, except that two tandem copies of a FLAG epitope tag (DYKDDDDK), flanking a potential glycosylation site (NGT) were introduced between the following two amino acids of human Insig-1: FLAG A, 112 and 113; FLAG B, 61 and 62; FLAG C, 151 and 152; FLAG D, 237 and 238. To generate these plasmids, AgeI sites were first introduced into the corresponding positions of the human Insig-1 coding region by in vitro site-directed mutagenesis using QuickChange XL site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) with pCMV-Insig-1-MycX3 as a template and the following primers: FLAG A, 5′-CAGAGGAATGTCACCGGTCTCTTCCCCGAG-3′ and 5′-CTCGGGGAAGAGACCGGTGACATTCCTCTG-3′; FLAG B, 5′-GACCCCGCGCCCAGGACCGGTCGCAGTGCTGCG-3′ and 5′-CGCAGCACTGCGACCGGTCCTGGGCGCGGGGTC-3′; FLAG C, 5′-GACAGTCACCTCACCGGTGAACCCCACAAA-3′ and 5′-TTTGTGGGGTTCACCGGTGAGGTGACTGTC-3′; FLAG D, 5′-GTCTATCAGTATACCGGTTCCCCAGATTTC-3′ and 5′-GAAATCTGGGGAACCGGTATACTGATAGAC-3′ (underlines denote AgeI sites).Mutagenesis was confirmed by sequencing. The BamHI-NotI fragment was released from the mutated plasmids and used to replace the corresponding fragment in pCMV-Insig-1-MycX3. The resulting plasmids were digested with AgeI, and a fragment encoding two copies of FLAG epitope tag flanking a potential glycosylation site was introduced into AgeI sites of these plasmids.pCMV-Insig-1-Myc, encoding wild-type human Insig-1 followed by six tandem copies of a c-Myc epitope tag under control of the CMV promoter was used as the template for the generation of all constructs used in cysteine derivitization studies. Briefly, site-directed mutagenesis (Stratagene QuikChange XL), performed according to the manufacturer's suggestions, was used to change all endogenous cysteine residues in Insig-1 to serine (amino acid positions 11, 13, 132, 133, 146, 167, 250). Next, the resultant cysteine-null pCMV-Insig-1-Myc plasmid was subjected to site-directed mutagenesis to introduce individual cysteines at single amino acid positions (S74C, S88C, S93C, V111C, S124C, A184C, T203C, S207C, G212C, V233C, S254C, A267C). All plasmids were sequenced in their entirety prior to use in transfection experiments.Cell Culture—Cells were grown in monolayer at 37 °C in an atmosphere of 8-9% CO2. Human embryonic kidney (HEK)-293 cells were maintained in medium A (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) (low glucose) containing 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin sulfate). SRD-13A cells are previously described cholesterol and unsaturated fatty acid auxotrophs derived from γ-irradiated Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells (15Rawson R.B. DeBose-Boyd R.A. Goldstein J.L.

On day 2, the cells were transfected with 4 μg of DNA per dish using a ratio of 12 μl of FuGENE 6 reagent (Roche Applied Science) to 4 μg of DNA in DMEM (without antibiotics) in a final volume of 0.4 ml as follows: FuGENE 6 was diluted in DMEM (without antibiotics), incubated for 5 min at room temperature, and mixed with DNA. This mixture was then further incubated for 15 min at room temperature. Cells were refed with 8 ml of fresh medium A, treated with 0.4 ml of the FuGENE 6/DNA mixture, and incubated at 37 °C for 16-24 h. On day 3, the cells were harvested for cell fractionation.SRD-13A cells were set up on day 0 in medium B at 7 × 105 cells per 60-mm dish. On day 1, the cells were transfected with 4 μg of DNA per dish by using FuGENE 6 reagent as described (15Rawson R.B. DeBose-Boyd R.A. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. J. Biol.

On day 3, the cells were washed once with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), switched to medium C (a 1:1 mixture of Ham's F-12 medium and DMEM containing 5% newborn calf lipoprotein-deficient serum, 50 μm sodium compactin, and 50 μm sodium mevalonate) containing 1% (w/v) hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin. After incubation at 37 °C for 1 h, cells were washed twice with PBS and switched to medium C in the absence or presence of sterols (10 μg/ml cholesterol plus 1 μg/ml 25-hydroxycholesterol added in ethanol (final concentration, 0.5% (v/v)). After incubation for 5 h, cells were harvested for cell fractionation. The total amount of DNA in each transfection was adjusted to 4 μg per dish by addition of pTK mock vector and/or pcDNA3 mock vector.Cell Fractionation—SRD-13A cells were fractionated as described (18DeBose-Boyd R.A.

The 1000 × g pellets were resuspended in 0.1 ml of buffer B (20 mm Hepes-KOH (pH 7.6), 25% (v/v) glycerol, 0.42 m NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm sodium EDTA, 5 mm sodium EGTA), rotated at 4 °C for 1 h, and centrifuged at 105 × g for 30 min at 4 °C in a Beckman TLA 100.2 rotor. The supernatant from this centrifugation was designated the nuclear extract. The supernatant from the original 1000 × g spin was used to prepare the membrane fraction by centrifugation at 105 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The resulting membrane pellets were resuspended in buffer D (10 mm Tris-HC1 (pH 7.4), 100 mm NaC1, 1% (w/v) SDS).HEK-293 cells were fractionated by the same procedure as SRD-13A cells. To determine the subcellular distribution of Insig-1, the supernatant from the original 1000 × g spin was subjected to centrifugation at 105 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The supernatant and pellet of this centrifugation was designated the 105 × g supernatant and 105 × g pellet, respectively. To prepare membranes for differential solubilization, protease treatment, glycosidase treatment, and cysteine derivitization, the supernatant from the original 1000 × g spin was subjected to centrifugation at 2 × 104 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. The resulting pellets were resuspended in buffer C (buffer A containing 100 mm NaCl) and designated as the membrane fraction. All the buffers used in the cell fractionation contained protease inhibitors (10 μg/ml leupeptin, 5 μg/ml pepstatin A, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 25 μg/ml N-acetyl-leucinal-leucinal-norleucinal) except when the membrane fraction was prepared for protease treatment. Protein concentration of the nuclear extracts and membrane fractions was determined using the BCA Kit (Pierce) according to the manufacturer's instructions.Protease Treatment—Trypsin treatment of the membrane fraction was carried out as described (19Nohturfft A. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17243-17250Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Briefly, aliquots of membranes (75-100 μg of protein) were treated with the indicated amount of trypsin in the absence or presence of 1% (v/v) Triton X-100 in a total volume of 58 μl of buffer C for 30 min at 30 °C. The reactions were then stopped by addition of 2 μl of soybean trypsin inhibitor (400 units), mixed with 5× SDS loading buffer (150 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 15% SDS, 25% glycerol, 0.02% (w/v) bromphenol blue, 12.5% (v/v) 2-mercaptoethanol), and boiled for 5 min. Proteinase K treatment of the membrane fraction was performed as follows: Aliquots of membranes (100 μg of protein) were treated with the indicated final concentration of proteinase K in the absence or presence of 1% Triton X-100 in a total volume of 58 μl of buffer C for 40 min at 30 °C. The reactions were stopped by addition of 2 μl of phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride at a final concentration of 5 mm. The samples were then mixed with 5× SDS loading buffer and boiled for 5 min. All the samples were subjected to SDS/PAGE and immunoblot analysis.Glycosidase Treatment—Glycosidase treatment of the membrane fraction was carried out as described (14Nohturfft A. DeBose-Boyd R.A.

For treatment with endoglycosidase (endo H) and peptide N-glycosidase F (PNGase F), aliquots of the membranes (60 μg of protein) in 60 μl of buffer C received 10 μl of solution containing 3.5% SDS and 7% 2-mercaptoethanol. After boiling for 10 min, each sample received sequential additions as follows: endo H treatment; 9 μl of 0.5 m sodium citrate (pH 5.5), 5 μl of water, followed by 1 μl of endo H (0.05 units); and PNGase F treatment; 7 μl of 0.5 m sodium phosphate (pH 7.5), 7 μl of 10% (v/v) Nonidet P-40 in water, followed by 1 μl of PNGase F (7.7 × 10-3 units). All reactions were carried out overnight at 37 °C and stopped by addition of 20 μl of 5× SDS loading buffer. The mixtures were then boiled for 5 min and subjected to SDS/PAGE and immunoblot analysis.Cysteine Derivitization—Aliquots of HEK-293 cell membrane fraction (100 μg of protein) were resuspended in 95 μl of buffer C with or without 5 mm (2-(trimethylammonium)ethyl) methanethiosulfonate bromide (MTSET). (A 100 mm stock solution of MTSET was prepared fresh in water.) After incubation for 30 min at room temperature, the membranes were spun twice at 2 × 104 × g for 15 min at 4 °C, washed in 200 μl of buffer C, resuspended in 90 μl of buffer C containing 100 μm biotin maleimide, and incubated for 20 min at room temperature. (A 24 mm stock solution of biotin maleimide was prepared in dimethyl formamide and stored at -20 °C.) At the end of the incubation, the reaction was quenched with 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol (final concentration), the cell membranes were collected by centrifugation, and the pellet was resuspended in 500 μl of buffer E (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 1.5% (w/v) Nonidet P-40, 0.1% (w/v) SDS) containing protease inhibitors as described above. Each sample then received a 35-μl aliquot of Immobilized Neutravidin Biotin Binding Protein (washed once in buffer E), after which the samples were incubated overnight under rotation at 4 °C and then centrifuged for 3 min at 200 × g to obtain a supernatant fraction for immunoblot analysis (see below). After removal of the supernatant, the pelleted beads were washed four times in buffer E, resuspended in 100 μl of SDS-containing buffer D, boiled for 5 min, and centrifuged for 30 s at 200 × g to separate the eluted pellet fraction from the beads. Both the supernatant and the eluted pellet fractions were then subjected to SDS/PAGE and immunoblot analysis.Immunoblot Analysis—Samples were subjected to SDS/PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose filters, and subjected to immunoblot analysis with various antibodies. Gels were calibrated with prestained broad range protein markers (New England BioLabs), and antibodies were used at the following concentrations: anti-Myc IgG-9E10, 1 μg/ml; anti-HSV tag antibody, 0.67 μg/ml; anti-SCAP IgG-9D5, 5 μg/ml; anti-KDEL antibody (StressGen Biotechnologies), 3 μg/ml; anti-transferrin receptor (Zymed Laboratories Inc.), 0.5 μg/ml; anti-FLAG M2 antibody, 1 μg/ml; and anti-mouse IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch), 0.2 μl/ml. Bound antibodies were visualized by chemiluminescence using the Supersignal Substrate System (Pierce) according to manufacturer's instructions. Filters were exposed to Kodak X-Omat Blue XB-1 films at room temperature for various times as indicated in legends.RESULTSFig, 1A shows a hydropathy plot of the amino acid sequence of human Insig-1. Based on this plot, Insig-1 is predicted to contain approximately six transmembrane segments, depicted by peak regions of hydrophobicity. Based on data from experiments described below, we suggest a membrane topology for human Insig-1 that is shown in Fig. 1B. The membrane-spanning segments correspond to hydrophobic sequences 1-6 in the hydropathy plot. The hydrophilic N-terminal and C-terminal ends are proposed to extend into the cytosol with the remaining portion, containing six membrane-spanning helices, embedded in the membrane.As a first step in these studies, we documented the membrane association of Insig-1 by transfecting human embryonic kidney-293 (HEK-293) cells with pCMV-Insig-1-MycX6, which encodes human Insig-1 with six copies of a c-Myc epitope tag at its C terminus (Fig. 2). Previous studies demonstrated that this epitope-tagged version of Insig-1 has wild-type activity in its ability to bind SCAP in a sterol-dependent fashion and"

The photoautotrophic and heterotrophic growth rate of the two mutants in copper-free and copper-supplemented medium as well as their photosystem I reduction kinetics in vivo were compared with those of wild-type cells. The two mutant strains grow at equivalent rates and show similar in vivo photosystem I reduction kinetics as wild-type cells when cultured in media that allow the expression of just one of the two electron donor proteins, but their ability to grow and reduce photosystem I is much lower when neither cytochrome c6 nor plastocyanin is expressed. These findings indicate that the normal functioning of the cyanobacterial photosynthetic and respiratory chains obligatorily depends on the presence of either cytochrome c6 or plastocyanin.

These findings indicate that the normal functioning of the cyanobacterial photosynthetic and respiratory chains obligatorily depends on the presence of either cytochrome c6 or plastocyanin. In eukaryotic organisms, the components of the photosynthetic and respiratory electron transfer chains are well identified and located in chloroplasts and mitochondria, respectively, but in cyanobacteria, the two redox pathways occur in the same membrane and share a number of components such as the plastoquinone pool and cytochrome b6f (1Schmetterer G.

Because respiratory cytochrome c is lacking in cyanobacteria, it has been proposed that these organisms use the same c-type cytochrome, in particular cytochrome c6 (Cyt), 1The abbreviations used are: Cyt, cytochrome c6; kF and kS, observed rate constants for the fast and slower phases, respectively, of biphasic kinetics; kM, observed rate constant for monophasic kinetics; Pc, plastocyanin; PSI, photosystem I; PSII, photosystem II; WT, wild-type; Tricine, N-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine. 1The abbreviations used are: Cyt, cytochrome c6; kF and kS, observed rate constants for the fast and slower phases, respectively, of biphasic kinetics; kM, observed rate constant for monophasic kinetics; Pc, plastocyanin; PSI, photosystem I; PSII, photosystem II; WT, wild-type; Tricine, N-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine. to serve both in photosynthesis and respiration (3Binder A. Hauser R. Krogmann D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1984; 765: 241-246Crossref Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Cyt is a well known electron carrier between cytochrome b6f and photosystem I (PSI) in cyanobacteria and some algae, but it can be replaced by plastocyanin (Pc) when the cells are grown in the presence of copper (cf. Ref. 4Hervás M. Navarro J.A. De la Rosa M.A. Accounts Chem. Res. 2003; 36: 798-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar for a recent review). In those species that are able to synthesize either Cyt or Pc, the expression level of the corresponding genes is controlled by the copper concentration in the growth medium (5Zhang L. McSpadden B. Pakrasi H.B. Whitmarsh J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 19054-19059Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Malakhov M.P. Malakhova O.A. Murata N. FEBS Lett. 1999; 444: 281-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Despite their intrinsic different conformations, Cyt and Pc share a number of similar physicochemical and structural features that allow them to interact with the same redox partners with equivalent kinetic efficiency and replace each other inside the cells (7Hervás M. Navarro J.A. Díaz A. Bottín H. De la Rosa M.A. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 11321-11326Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 8Molina-Heredia F.P. Hervás M. Navarro J.A. De la Rosa M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 601-605Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The two metalloproteins are thus presented as an excellent case study of biological evolution, which is not only convergent (two structures playing the same role) but also parallel (two proteins varying in a concerted way from one organism to another) (9De la Rosa M.A. Navarro J.A. Díaz-Quintana A. De la Cerda B. Molina-Heredia F.P. Balme A. Murdoch P.S. Díaz-Moreno I. Durán R.V. Hervás M. Bioelectrochemistry. 2002; 55: 41-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Such a interchangeability between Cyt and Pc in photosynthesis has also been proposed for the respiratory chain in which the two metalloproteins could act as alternative donors of electrons to cytochrome c oxidase (1Schmetterer G. Bryant D.G. The Molecular Biology of Cyanobacteria. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Norwell, MA1994: 409-435Crossref Google Scholar, 10Pils D. Gregor W. Schmetterer G. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1997; 152: 83-88Crossref Google Scholar). The observations by Zhang et al. (11Zhang L. Pakrasi H.B. Whitmarsh J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5036-5042Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with Cyt- or Pc-deficient mutant strains of the cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 led these authors to conclude that electrons can be transferred from the cytochrome b6f complex to PSI in the absence of both Cyt and Pc and that Cyt is not obligatorily required for respiratory electron transport. Metzger et al. (12Metzger S.U. Pakrasi H.B. Whitmarsh J. Mathis P. Photosynthesis: From Light to Biosphere. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Norwell, MA1995: 823-826Google Scholar) indeed proposed the presence of a third electron carrier as the mutant strains of Synechocystis were able to grow photoautotrophically and sustain normal rates of oxygen evolution and dark respiration in the absence of both Cyt and Pc. These authors also measured the kinetics of in vivo PSI reduction and found that the electron transfer rates only occurred 4-6 times slower in the mutants than in the wild-type (WT) cells. The challenge is thus to understand how photosynthetic and respiratory electron transport chains operate in cyanobacterial cells in the absence of both Cyt and Pc. To answer this question, we herein report the construction of mutant strains of Synechocystis cells that lack either Cyt or Pc to further analyze their photoautotrophic and heterotrophic growth along with their in vivo PSI reduction kinetics. In contrast to previous proposals, our findings allow us to conclude that the normal functioning of the cyanobacterial photosynthetic and respiratory chains obligatorily depends on the presence of one of these proteins, thus discarding the existence of any third efficient electron carrier. Strains and Culture Conditions—Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 was grown photoautotrophically in liquid or solid mineral BG-11 medium (13Rippka R. Deruelles J. Waterbury J.B. Herman M. Stanier R.Y. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1979; 111: 1-61Crossref Google Scholar) either in the presence or absence of copper under continuous white fluorescent illumination (50 microeinsteins m-2 s-1) at 30 °C. Liquid cultures were bubbled with air supplemented with 1% (v/v) CO2. When necessary, copper was added at 1 μm, whereas copper-depleted medium (BG-11-C) was supplemented with 300 μm bathocuproinedisulfonic acid as a chelating agent to eliminate any traces of copper (14Tottey S. Rich P.R. Rondet S.A.M. Robinson N.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 19999-20004Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Cell cultures with or without copper were pre-adapted to the new conditions by repeated incubation cycles, and cell growth was monitored by spectrophotometrically measuring the chlorophyll content (15Arnon D.I. Plant Physiol. 1949; 24: 1-15Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Total protein concentration was determined as described elsewhere (16Markwell M.A.K. Haas S.M. Bieber L.L. Tolbert N.E. Anal. Biochem. 1978; 87: 206-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (5326) Google Scholar). Light-activated heterotrophic growth experiments were carried out by adding 10 mm glucose to the standard BG-11 or BG-11-C solid medium. Cell cultures were incubated in darkness with 5-min pulses of white light (50 microeinsteins m-2 s-1) every 24 h (17Anderson S.L. McIntosh L. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 2761-2767Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Other conditions were as for the photoautotrophic growth. Escherichia coli DH5α was grown in Luria-Bertani liquid or solid medium (18Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) supplemented, when required, with kanamycin (50 μg ml-1), spectinomycin (100 μg ml-1), or ampicillin (100 μg ml-1). Cloning and Deletional Inactivation of petE and petJ Genes—To amplify the petE gene (coding for Pc) and its flanking regions by PCR, the following two oligonucleotides were designed from the genomic sequence of Synechocystis (19Kaneko T. Sato S. Kotani H. Tanaka A. Asamizu E. Nakamura Y. Miyajima N. Hirosawa M. Sugiura M. Sasamoto S. Kimura T. Hosouchi T. Matsuno A. Muraki A. Nakazaki N. Naruo K. Okumura S. Shimpo S. Takeuchi C. Wada T. Watanabe A. Yamada M. Yasuda M. Tabata S. DNA Res. 1996; 3: 109-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (2121) Google Scholar) (NCBI accession number NC_000911): RPC001A (attggcacggcccatcttcccta) as the direct primer and RPC001B (atcgcccctccgttggcggtgtct) as the reverse primer. Genomic DNA from Synechocystis was used as a template (Fig. 1) (20Cai Y. Wolk C.P. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 3138-3145Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar). A 2.6-kb band resulting from PCR was purified by electrophoresis in 1% agarose gel and cloned into the pGEMT commercial vector (Promega) to obtain the pPlaF plasmid. The SmaI-CelII fragment from pPlaF was replaced by a C.K1 kanamycin resistance cassette from pRL161 plasmid (21Elhai J. Wolk C.P. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 68: 119-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar). A 5.2-kb band was obtained after pPlaF digestion with SmaI and CelII, and its ends were blunted with Klenow polymerase and ligated with a 1.3-kb fragment obtained after pRL161 digestion with HinCII. The resulting pPlaFΔCK1 plasmid was tested by restriction analysis. Synechocystis WT cells were transformed with this plasmid by standard procedures (22Williams J.G.K. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 167: 766-778Crossref Scopus (851) Google Scholar), and the transformants were selected and segregated in solid medium with increasing amounts of kanamycin from 50 to 500 μg ml-1. The correct integration and segregation of the deleted copies was tested by Southern blot as follows. Genomic DNA of isolated mutants were digested with XmnI and separated in 0.7% agarose electrophoretic gels. DNA was then transferred to Z-probe nylon membranes (Bio-Rad). As a probe, the NheI-SmaI fragment from pPlaF was radioactively labeled with 32P using the commercial kit Ready-to-Go (Amersham Biosciences). In a XmnI digestion of the genomic DNA, this probe hybridized with a 2,125-bp band in the case of WT and with a 3,073-bp band in the case of deletion mutant. Similarly, the RCYT001A (atggtgtggcggaaggtcgcaataa) and RCYT001B (tagccaatagctctggccctgccgat) oligonucleotides were designed as direct and reverse primers, respectively, for PCR amplification of the open reading frame corresponding to the petJ gene (coding for Cyt) and its flanking regions (Fig. 1). A 2.4-kb band was purified and cloned into pGEMT to generate the pCytF plasmid. The fragment NheI-EcoRV from pCytF was replaced by the Ω fragment from the pRL-SPE plasmid, which contains the aadA gene that confers spectinomycin resistance as follows. pCytF was digested with NheI and EcoRV, and the resulting 5.0-kb band was isolated by 1% agarose gel electrophoresis. The ends of this band were blunted with Klenow polymerase. The PvuII fragment from pRL-SPE corresponding to the Ω cassette was ligated to the 5.0-kb NheI-EcoRV fragment from pCytF, and the resulting pCytFΔSPE plasmid was tested by restriction analysis. The transformants were segregated and tested as for petE inactivation but using spectinomycin and streptomycin as selective antibiotics at concentrations ranging from 2.5 to 20 μg ml-1. For the Southern blot analysis, genomic DNA was digested with BstEII using the ClaI-EcoRV fragment from pCytF as probe. In a BstEII digestion of the genomic DNA, this probe hybridized with a 2,904-bp band in the case of WT and with a 1,680-bp band in the case of deletion mutant. SDS-PAGE and Immunoblotting—Proteins from Synechocystis WT cells and from the mutant strains were isolated and separated by 15% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis using standard protocols (23Schägger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10475) Google Scholar). 100 μg of total protein were charged in each case. After separation, proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride Immobilon-PSQ membranes (Millipore) and immunodetected with polyclonal antibodies raised against Synechocystis Pc or Cyt. Antibodies were obtained by inoculating purified proteins (24Hervás M. Navarro F. Navarro J.A. Chávez S. Díaz A. Florencio F.J. De la Rosa M.A. FEBS Lett. 1993; 319: 257-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 25De la Cerda B. Díaz-Quintana A. Navarro J.A. Hervás M. De la Rosa M.A. J. Biol.

Binding of antibodies was visualized with peroxidase-conjugated antibodies and the commercial ECL-Plus kit (Amersham Biosciences). Kinetics Analysis of in Vivo PSI Reduction—WT and mutant cells of Synechocystis were harvested by centrifugation at different growing phases and suspended in 20 mm Tricine-KOH buffer, pH 7.0, supplemented with 10% (w/v) Ficoll to avoid cell aggregation. The in vivo kinetics for electron transfer from either Pc (in copper-supplemented cultures) or Cyt (in copper-depleted cultures) to PSI were followed by laser flash absorption spectroscopy as previously described (26Hervás M. Myshkin E. Vintonenko N. De la Rosa M.A. Bullerjahn G.S. Navarro J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 8179-8183Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). The reaction cell (optical path length, 1 mm) contained whole Synechocystis cells at 150-300 μg ml-1 chlorophyll concentration and 1 mm ascorbate. The kinetics were recorded after excitation by laser flash both in the absence and presence of 20 μm phenazine methasulfate, which is a well known efficient donor of electrons to PSI. Interferences arising from photosystem II (PSII) were avoided by pre-illumination of the samples with white light in the presence of 10 μm DCMU (3-(3′,4′-dichlorophenyl)-1,1-dimethylurea) and 10 mm hydroxylamine (27Soriano G.M. Ponomarev M.V. Tae G.S. Cramer W.A. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 14590-14598Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Deletion of the petE and petJ Genes in Synechocystis Cells—The cyanobacterial cells were transformed with the pPlaFΔCK1 or pCytFΔSPE plasmids, and the resulting ΔpetE and ΔpetJ strains were selected as transformants corresponding to petE and petJ null mutants, respectively. ΔpetE was selected in BG-11-C medium with 300 μm bathocuproinedisulfonic acid to ensure the complete removal of copper and kanamycin (500 μg ml-1). ΔpetJ was selected in BG-11 medium supplemented with 1 μm copper in the presence of both spectinomycin and streptomycin (20 μg ml-1 each). The correct integration and segregation of both mutants were checked by Southern blot (Fig. 2) with the length of resulting bands and the absence of other bands being as expected for completely segregated mutants (see “Experimental Procedures”). Several attempts to segregate the double mutant were unsuccessful. In agreement with the copper-dependent regulation of Pc and Cyt expression levels (see Introduction), WT Synechocystis cells synthesize either Pc or Cyt when cultured in the presence or absence of copper, respectively (Fig. 3). Accordingly, the ΔpetE strain produces Cyt when growing in copper-depleted medium but is completely unable to synthesize even traces of Cyt and/or Pc when the medium is supplemented with this metal. In a similar way, the ΔpetJ strain forms Pc in copper-supplemented medium but no detectable levels of Cyt and/or Pc were yielded in cells cultured in the absence of copper (Fig. 3). Photoautotrophic Growth of WT and Mutant Strains—The ability of the ΔpetE and ΔpetJ mutants to grow under photoautotrophic conditions was determined in cultures with and without copper. As previous studies in the absence of a copper-chelating agent had led to controversial results (28Ardelean I. Matthijs H.C.P. Havaux M. Joset F. Jeanjean R. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 2002; 213: 113-119Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and we had observed by Western blot analysis that residual copper levels (nanomolar range) in the culture medium were enough to induce Pc expression (data not shown), the copper-chelating agent bathocuproinedisulfonic acid was added to the cell cultures to completely remove metal traces and abolish residual Pc expression. Growth curves show not only that the WT strain similarly grows either with or without added copper but also that the two deletion mutants grow at rates equivalent to that of WT when cultured in media that allow them to express one of the two electron donor proteins (Fig. 4). In fact, ΔpetE is only able to grow at a standard rate in the absence of copper, i.e. when Cyt is produced, whereas ΔpetJ grows normally when Pc is synthesized because of copper induction. When the ΔpetE and ΔpetJ strains are under conditions at which the expression levels of both Pc and Cyt are not detectable, their respective growth rate is much lower than that of WT cells. In contrast to such a drastic decrease in the growth rates of the two mutant strains, Zhang et al. (11Zhang L. Pakrasi H.B. Whitmarsh J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5036-5042Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) reported a slightly diminished growth rate and a normal steady-state photosynthetic electron transport for their Pc- and Cyt-deficient mutants under similar photoautotrophic conditions. In view of these discrepancies, the kinetics for PSI reduction in whole cells of ΔpetE and ΔpetJ were analyzed by laser flash absorption spectroscopy. In Vivo Reduction of PSI in WT, ΔpetE, and ΔpetJ Cells—In vitro PSI reduction by Cyt and Pc has been extensively investigated in a wide variety of photosynthetic organisms such as cyanobacteria (including Synechocystis), green algae, and plants (7Hervás M. Navarro J.A. Díaz A. Bottín H. De la Rosa M.A. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 11321-11326Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 25De la Cerda B. Díaz-Quintana A. Navarro J.A. Hervás M.

Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1184: 235-241Crossref Scopus (64) Google Scholar). However, little is known on the kinetic behavior of the two metalloproteins serving as electron donors to PSI in vivo (30Baymann F. Rappaport F. Joliot P. Kallas T. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 10570-10577Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). In this work, the kinetics of in vivo PSI reduction by Cyt or Pc in Synechocystis were analyzed in whole cells by following the absorbance changes at 820 nm after flash-induced P700 photoxidation. From the resulting kinetics, the values for the observed rate constants of PSI reduction by either Pc or Cyt were estimated. In WT Synechocystis cells growing in culture media supplemented with copper, PSI reduction was only ascribed to Pc because Cyt synthesis was repressed and the kinetics were well fitted to monoexponential curves (Fig. 5). The value for the observed rate constant of such a monophasic kinetic (kM) was ∼2,700 s-1 (t1/2, 250 μs) (Table I). In WT Synechocystis cells growing in copper-depleted cultures in which Pc synthesis was repressed, Cyt-dependent PSI reduction followed a biphasic kinetic (Fig. 5): the first, fast phase yielded a rate constant (kF) of ∼45,000 s-1 (t1/2, 16 μs), and the second, slower phase exhibited a rate constant (kS) of ∼2,000 s-1 (t1/2, 350 μs) (Table I). The fast and slow phases accounted for 37 and 63%, respectively, of the total signal amplitude. These values for kM, kF, and kS remained constant at the different culture stages but significantly increase when phenazine methasulfate, a well known artificial electron donor to PSI, was added to the reaction cell (not shown).Table IObserved rate constants for in vivo PSI reduction of WT, ΔpetE, and ΔpetJ Synechocystis cells+Cu−CukM × 10−3kF × 10−4kS × 10−3s-1WT2.7 ± 0.24.5 ± 0.62.0 ± 0.2ΔpetE<0.014.0 ± 0.33.1 ± 0.2ΔpetJ3.6 ± 0.2ND<0.01 Open table in a new tab In vivo PSI reduction in both ΔpetE and ΔpetJ cells growing under conditions that allow the expression of one of the two electron donor proteins follows kinetics similar to those observed in the WT strain (Fig. 5). In fact, the kinetics with the ΔpetE mutant in the absence of copper and with the ΔpetJ mutant in the presence of copper were, respectively, biphasic and monophasic and their observed rate constants were equivalent to those attained with the WT cells (Table I), but no PSI reduction was detected in mutant cells in which neither Pc nor Cyt was expressed (Fig. 5). These data not only explain our experimental observations on the photoautotrophic growth of WT and mutant Synechocystis strains (see above) but also suggest that either Cyt or Pc is obligatorily required for the efficient reduction of PSI. In contrast, Metzger et al. (12Metzger S.U. Pakrasi H.B. Whitmarsh J. Mathis P. Photosynthesis: From Light to Biosphere. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Norwell, MA1995: 823-826Google Scholar) observed in vivo PSI reduction even in the absence of Pc or Cyt, a finding that can be ascribed to one (or both) of the following facts: (i) optical interferences derived from PSII excitation, or (ii) Pc expression because of residual copper levels. To avoid these difficulties and assure that the observed kinetic signals can only be assigned to changes in the oxidation state of PSI, we have used a 694-nm laser flash to specifically favor the excitation of PSI over PSII, have added DCMU-hydroxylamine to the reaction cell to block electron transfer from PSII, have confirmed that the kinetic signals are ascribed to PSI by adding phenazine methasulfate, and have completely removed copper from copper-free culture media by adding an efficient chelating agent. Light-activated Heterotrophic Growth of WT and Mutant Cells—Taking into account that the cyanobacterial respiratory and photosynthetic electron transfer chains share a number of redox components like Cyt and Pc (1Schmetterer G.

Lett. 1997; 152: 83-88Crossref Google Scholar), the ability of the WT, ΔpetE, and ΔpetJ strains to grow in glucose-supplemented culture media was investigated. Under such heterotrophic conditions, glucose was used as an organic carbon source (17Anderson S.L. McIntosh L. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 2761-2767Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and the electrons were transported from the sugar molecule to dioxygen throughout the respiratory pathway. Fig. 6 shows that none of the cell strains (including the WT) can grow in copper-free medium. This is as expected from the specific requirement for copper of cytochrome c oxidase to be correctly assembled and able to function (10Pils D. Gregor W. Schmetterer G. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1997; 152: 83-88Crossref Google Scholar). However, in copper-containing media, the WT and ΔpetJ strains synthesized Pc and showed a normal growth level but the ΔpetE strain produced neither Cyt nor Pc and was thus unable to grow because of the absence of a donor of electrons to cytochrome c oxidase. Taken together, all of these data indicate that there is no any other alternative redox mediator as efficient as Cyt and Pc in the photosynthetic and respiratory electron transport chains and therefore Synechocystis cells strictly depend on the synthesis of either Cyt or Pc to grow not only photoautotrophically but also heterotrophically.

Differentiated R28 rat retinal neuronal cells were used as an experimental model. Cells were maintained in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium supplemented with 10% newborn calf serum, and during the period of experimentation were exposed either to the absence or presence of 10 nm insulin. Insulin treatment induced p70S6K, mTOR, and Akt phosphorylation, effects that were completely prevented by the PI3K inhibitor, LY294002. Insulin-induced phosphorylation of p70S6K and mTOR was prevented by the mTOR inhibitor, rapamycin. Apoptosis, induced by serum deprivation and evaluated by Hoechst staining, was inhibited by insulin treatment in R28 cells, but not in L6 muscle cells. This effect of insulin was also largely prevented by rapamycin. Inhibition of p70S6K activity by exogenous expression of a dominant negative mutant of p70S6K prevented insulin-induced cell survival, whereas, overexpression of wild type p70S6K or expression of a rapamycin resistant form of the kinase enhanced the effect of insulin on survival. Enhanced cell survival under the latter condition was accompanied by increased p70S6K activity and phosphorylation. Rapamycin did not inhibit insulin induced p70S6K phosphorylation and activity in cells transfected with the rapamycin-resistant mutant. Together, these results suggest that p70S6K plays a key role in insulin stimulated retinal neuronal cell survival.

Several studies have identified activation of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) 1The abbreviations used are: PI3K, phosphoinositide 3-kinase; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; HA, hemagglutinin. as a necessary step in the cell survival pathway that is stimulated by a number of growth factors and insulin (3Barber A.J.

Science. 2002; 296: 1655-1657Crossref PubMed Scopus (4681) Google Scholar). Akt/PKB, a protein kinase that functions downstream of PI3K in the insulin signal transduction pathway, is also involved in the regulation of cell survival (6Franke T.F. Kaplan D.R. Cantley L.C. Cell. 1997; 88: 435-437Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1528) Google Scholar). Evidence for a role of Akt in IGF-1-mediated cell survival was provided by Dudek et al. (7Dudek H. Datta S.R. Franke T.F. Birnbaum M.J. Yao R. Cooper G.M. Segal R.A. Kaplan D.R. Greenberg M.E. Science. 1997; 275: 661-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (2222) Google Scholar) showing that overexpression of Akt prevents apoptosis in primary cultures of cerebellar neurons induced by survival factor withdrawal or chemical inhibition of PI3K. The expression of dominant-negative forms of Akt interferes with growth factor-mediated survival in these cells, indicating that Akt is necessary and sufficient for neuronal survival. We have also shown that both IGF-I and insulin can rescue retinal neuronal cells from apoptosis through a PI3-kinase/Akt mediated mechanism (3Barber A.J. Nakamura M. Wolpert E.B. Reiter C.E.

It is now believed that there are five domains in the primary structure of S6K1. Beginning with the N terminus, they are: acidic, catalytic, linker, autoinhibitory, and the C-terminal domain (14Pullen N. Thomas G.

Many growth factors, including insulin, activate p70S6K in a PI3K-dependent manner. In addition, amino acids can activate S6K1 in a PI3K-independent manner. Compared with the upstream effectors, the only known downstream effector of S6K1 is the 40 S ribosomal S6 protein. Phosphorylation of S6 allows translational up-regulation of mRNAs containing 5′-tracts of pyrimidines (TOP), which encode for components of the translational apparatus (37Jefferies H.B. Fumagalli S.

Nature. 1995; 377: 358-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Most studies of S6K1 including ours have to date focused on its role in protein synthesis and cell cycle regulation. In those studies, we reported that insulin controls protein synthesis in skeletal muscle through activation of p70S6K (41Kimball S.R. Farrell P.A. Jefferson L.S. J. Appl. Physiol. 2002; 93: 1168-1180Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar, 42Anthony J.C. Lang C.H. Crozier S.J. Anthony T.G. MacLean D.A. Kimball S.R. Jefferson L.S. Am. J. Physiol. Endocrinol. Metab. 2002; 282: E1092-E1101Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). However, a number of recent studies have suggested that S6K1 may be intimately involved in mediating cell survival. Wan and Helman (43Wan X. Helman L.J. Neoplasia. 2002; 4: 400-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) found that inhibition of the p70S6K pathway may enhance chemotherapy-induced apoptosis in the treatment of IGF-II-overexpressing tumors. Agents that cause apoptosis inactivate mTOR signaling as a common early response prior to caspase activation (44Tee A.R. Proud C.G. Cell Death Differ. 2001; 8: 841-849Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Rapamycin, a macrolide immunosuppressant that is a specific inhibitor of mTOR, represses p70S6K, prevents phosphorylation of Ser136 on BAD, and blocks cell survival induced by IGF-I. IGF-I-induced phosphorylation of BAD Ser136 is abolished in p70S6K-deficient cells (45Harada H. Andersen J.S. Mann M. Terada N. Korsmeyer S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 9666-9670Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar). In addition, rapamycin induces apoptosis in different cell types (46Koh J.S. Lieberthal W. Heydrick S. Levine J.S. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 102: 716-727Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 47Lieberthal W. Fuhro R. Andry C.C. Rennke H. Abernathy V.E. Koh J.S. Valeri R. Levine J.S. Am. J. Physiol.

Blood. 2001; 98: 174-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Overall, the results of these studies strongly support a role for p70S6K in promoting cell survival. Based on the results of the studies described above, we hypothesize that insulin promotes retinal neuronal cell survival in a p70S6K-dependent manner. In the present study, the rat retinal neuronal cell line R28 was used as an in vitro model to examine this hypothesis. We found that insulin promotes phosphorylation and activation of p70S6K and exogenous expression of wild type S6K1 decreased pyknotic cell numbers in serum-starved cells and insulin further decreased apoptosis in such cells. Rapamycin did not block the insulin cell survival effect in R28 cells expressing a rapamycin-resistant p70S6K, indicating that insulin promotes R28 cell survival in a p70S6K-dependent manner. These data suggest that p70S6K phosphorylation and activity may contribute to retinal cell survival in vivo. Plasmids—S6K1 constructs were a kind gift from Dr. John Blenis (Department of Cell Biology, Harvard Medical School, Boston) (50Martin K.A. Schalm S.S. Richardson C. Romanelli A. Keon K.L. Blenis J.

The constructs include control vector pRK7, wild type construct HA-p70S6K1/pRK7, kinase inactive construct HA-p70S6K1-F5A, and C-terminal truncated construct HA-p70S6K1-E389-ΔCT. Detailed primary sequence alignment has been previously reported (52Gout I. Minami T. Hara K. Tsujishita Y. Filonenko V. Waterfield M.D. Yonezawa K. J. Biol.

Cell Culture—R28 cells were a generous gift from Dr. Gail M. Seigel, State University of New York, Buffalo (53Seigel G.M. Chiu L. Paxhia A. Mol. Vis. 2000; 6: 157-163PubMed Google Scholar). They were grown in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM) containing 5 mm glucose supplemented with 10% newborn calf serum (Hyclone). The cells were differentiated to neurons on laminin-coated plates or coverslips with addition of 25 mm cell-permeable cAMP (Sigma) 24 h prior to experiments, as described previously (3Barber A.J.

Cells were seeded at 5 × 105/60-mm dish or 3 × 105/well in 6-well plates with coverslips 24 h prior to transfection or treatments. Cells were then placed in serum-free DMEM for 24 h prior to stimulation and lysis. L6 muscle cells were purchased from ATCC and were also cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% newborn bovine serum. Transfection—R28 cells were seeded 24 h before transfection at 3 × 105 (6-well plates) or 5 × 105 (60-mm plates). PLUS™ reagent (Invitrogen Life Technologies, Inc.) was mixed with serum-free DMEM and incubated with 3 μg/well (6-well plates) or 6 μg/dish (60-mm dishes) of DNA for 15 min to form the PLUS™-DNA complex. LipofectAMINE was then added to the above mixture and incubation was continued for another 15 min. During the incubation, fresh serum-free medium was applied to R28 cells. LipofectAMINE-PLUS-DNA complex was added, and cells were incubated at 37 °C, 5% CO2 for 3 h. After 3 h of transfection, fresh medium with 10% NCS was added. This method routinely yields 30–40% transfection efficiency in R28 cells. Cells were incubated for another 24 h (for apoptosis studies) or 36 h (for kinase assay and Western blot). Immunocytochemistry and Hoechst Staining—Transfected R28 cells were deprived of serum, pretreated with or without rapamycin (10 nm), and treated for 24 h with or without 10 nm insulin. The cells were fixed in 1% paraformaldehyde and blocked at room temperature for 1 h in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1% Triton (PBST) and 10% donkey serum. They were then incubated at room temperature for 1 h in PBST with rabbit anti-HA polyclonal antibody (1:200, Clontech, Palo Alto, CA). The cells were washed and incubated at room temperature for 1 h with rhodamine red X-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgG (1: 2000, Jackson Immunologicals, West Grove, PA). Cells were simultaneously stained with the nuclear dye bisbenzimide (Hoechst dye 33258, 0.5 μg/ml, Sigma). For all other experiments in which R28 cells were stained with Hoechst, they were incubated in Hoechst (1:2000) for 1 h at room temperature, and mounted to slides with Aqua mount. Apoptosis Quantification—(A) For cells stained only with bisbenzimide Hoechst 33258 (0.5 μg/ml; Sigma), five fields were randomly sampled from each coverslip by fluorescence microscopy, and all the cells stained with Hoechst dye in each field were counted. The number of pyknotic cells with condensed or fragmented nuclei was summated in the five sampled regions. The percentage of pyknotic cells per coverslip was then calculated as described previously (3Barber A.J. Nakamura M. Wolpert E.B. Reiter C.E. Seigel G.M. Antonetti D.A. Gardner T.W. J. Biol.

(B) For R28 cells transfected with S6K1 constructs, at least 100 HA-positive cells were counted per coverslip. Pyknotic cell numbers were also measured for HA-positive cells. Protein Extraction and Protein Assay—R28 cells were harvested as described previously (54Antonetti D.A. Barber A.J. Hollinger L.A. Wolpert E.B. Gardner T.W. J. Biol.

Protein was extracted by incubating samples at 4 °C for 15 min followed by 10min centrifugation at 14,000 × g. Protein concentration was determined by using Bio-Rad DC reagent compared with bovine serum albumin standard. S6 Kinase Assay—S6 kinase assay kit was from Upstate Biotechnology. Manufacturer’s instructions were followed in performing the assay. Immunoprecipitation of p70 S6 kinase: 2 μg of anti-p70 S6 kinase or anti-HA antibody were prebound to 100 μl of a 50% protein A-agarose slurry that had been washed in PBS for 1h at 4 °C. The supernatant was removed and the protein A-agarose was washed twice with Buffer A. The washed beads were resuspended in 200 μl of Buffer A, and cell lysates containing 200 μg of protein were then immunoprecipitated using the prepared beads for 2 h at 4 °C. Protein A-agarose/enzyme immunocomplex was sequentially washed in 500 μl of Buffer A containing 0.5 m NaCl, Buffer A alone, and ADBI. Kinase Assay with Protein A Enzyme Immunocomplex—10 μl of ADBI, inhibitor mixture, substrate mixture, and [γ-32P]ATP mixture were added to the microcentrifuge tube containing the protein A enzyme immunocomplex and incubated for 10 min at 30 °C. 25-μl aliquots were then transferred toa2cm × 2 cm P81 paper, and the squares were washed three times with 0.75% phosphoric acid for 5 min per wash, and once with acetone for 5 min. The P81 squares were transferred to a scintillation vial and 5 ml of scintillation mixture were added. Incorporation of 32P into substrate was measured by scintillation spectrometry and calculated as the difference in CPM incorporated into substrate in assays containing and assays lacking sample (background control). Antibodies and Immunoblotting—Anti-p70S6 kinase SC-18 was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Anti-phospho-p70S6K (Thr389), anti-Akt/phospho-Akt (Ser473), and anti-mTOR/phospho-mTOR(Ser2448) were from Cell Signaling Technologies. Anti-phospho-p70S6 kinase (Thr229) was from R&D System and anti-HA-Tag was from Clontech (BD Biosciences). Proteins were separated on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Membranes were blocked using 5% nonfat milk (TBST) for 1 h at room temperature with rocking. Primary antibody (1:1000) incubations were carried out in 5% nonfat milk-TBST (total antibodies) or 5% bovine serum albumin-TBST (phosphospecific antibodies) overnight at 4 °C. Membranes were washed in TBST three times for 10 min. Membranes were then incubated in donkey-anti-rabbit IgG-HRP (1:5000) for 1 h at room temperature followed by another three washes in TBST. Proteins were visualized using LumiGlo chemiluminescence reagent (Cell Signaling Technologies), using a Genome bioimaging system and analyzed using GeneTool software (Syngene). Statistic Analysis—The minimum level of statistical significance was set at α = 0.05. Statistical comparisons were made by Student’s t test or analysis of variance. Insulin Induces Phosphorylation/Activation of p70S6 Kinase in a Time-dependent Manner in R28 Rat Retinal Neuronal Cells—Insulin induction of P70S6K phosphorylation has been demonstrated in several types of cells and tissues, but the response has not been previously studied in retinal cells.

Chem. 2001; 276: 32814-32821Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar) showed that insulin induces phosphorylation of Akt in R28 cells through PI3K-mediated signaling, and that 10 nm insulin activates the insulin receptor but not the IGF-I receptor. Because p70S6K acts downstream of PI3K, we asked if p70S6K is phosphorylated in response to insulin in R28 cells. To this end, we first sought to demonstrate an effect of insulin on p70S6K. Serum-deprived cells were incubated in medium containing 10 nm insulin for time periods ranging from 15 min to 24 h. The results show that insulin induced phosphorylation of p70S6K within 15 min, and the effect was maintained for at least 4 h (Fig. 1A). A similar time course for changes in phosphorylation was also observed for Akt (Fig. 1A). After 24 h, both Akt and p70S6K phosphorylation returned to basal values. Insulin also stimulated S6 kinase activity by ∼3-fold (p < 0.01) within 15 min as measured in extracts of insulin-treated compare with control cells (Fig. 1D). These data indicate that insulin can induce phosphorylation and activation of p70S6K in rat retinal neuronal cells, as has been observed for other types of cells. Insulin Induces Phosphorylation of p70S6K through the PI3K/Akt/mTOR Pathway in R28 Cells—We next asked if the activation of p70S6K by insulin occurs through the PI3K/Akt pathway, so the PI3K inhibitor LY294002 and the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin were employed. As shown in Fig. 2, both LY294002 and rapamycin completely inhibited insulin-induced p70S6K phosphorylation. In contrast, LY294002 inhibited insulin-induced phosphorylation of Akt, but rapamycin did not (Fig. 2). To determine if insulin induces mTOR phosphorylation in R28 cells, cells were treated with either the PI3K inhibitor LY294002 or the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin prior to analysis of mTOR phosphorylation on Ser2448. As shown in Fig. 3, insulin increased mTOR phosphorylation by 2.5-fold (p < 0.01) in R28 cells, and both LY294002 and rapamycin completely inhibited insulin-induced mTOR phosphorylation. Together, these data suggest that insulin induces phosphorylation of mTOR through the PI3K pathway, and that insulin activates p70S6K via PI3K/Akt/mTOR in retinal neurons.Fig. 3Insulin induces phosphorylation of mTOR through the PI3K pathway in R28 cells. R28 cells were seeded as described under “Experimental Procedures.” After 2 h of serum starvation, cells were treated with or without 50 μm PI3K inhibitor LY294002 or 10 nm mTOR inhibitor rapamycin for 1 h, followed by 15 min insulin treatment.

As a downstream effector of Akt, p70S6K may be involved in the cell survival effect of insulin. This idea is supported by the results of several studies showing that rapamycin is a proapoptotic agent (39Hosoi H. Dilling M.B. Shikata T. Liu L.N. Shu L. Ashmun R.A. Germain G.S. Abraham R.T.

Blood. 2001; 98: 174-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar), but its role in retinal cells is unknown. Here we investigated whether or not rapamycin affects the ability of insulin to promote cell survival in R28 cells. Differentiated R28 cells were incubated in serum free medium in the presence or absence of insulin (10 nm) or rapamycin for 24 h. R28 cells were maintained in serum-containing medium supplemented with or without rapamycin served as controls. Cells were then fixed in 1% paraformaldehyde and stained with Hoechst dye. Consistent with the previous studies, insulin significantly (p < 0.01) reduced the number of pyknotic cells in serum-starved R28 cells. Rapamycin alone had no effect on the number of pyknotic cells in the presence of serum but completely inhibited the cell survival effect of insulin on serum-starved cells (Fig. 4, A and B). This observation implies that components of serum other than insulin act through a rapamycin-independent mechanism to promote cell survival in R28 cells, and insulin acts via rapamycin dependent pathways. However, in cultures of L6 myoblasts, insulin rescued cells to the same extent as for R28 cells, but rapamycin had no effect on either insulin- or serum-induced cell survival (Fig. 4, C and D). Thus, the rapamycin effect is cell type-specific, and neurons may be more susceptible than muscle cells to effects of p70S6K inhibition. Insulin Promotes R28 Cell Survival in a p70S6K-dependent Manner—Recent evidence suggests p70S6K is involved in suppressing apoptosis in various cell types (39Hosoi H. Dilling M.B. Shikata T. Liu L.N.

To address this question, variants of p70S6K were introduced into R28 cells by cDNA transfection. The cDNA used encoded the wild type enzyme HA-p70S6K1, a kinase-inactive variant HA-p70S6K1-F5/A, a C-terminally truncated variant HA-p70S6K1-E389-ΔCT, which is rapamyc"

We have identified specific serines within the Arm repeat domain that, when mutated to alanine, promote p120ctn association with interphase microtubules, leading to microtubule reorganization and stabilization. The mutant p120ctn also localized to the mitotic spindle and centrosomes. In contrast to wild-type p120ctn, the microtubule-associated p120ctn mutant did not activate Rac1 and did not induce a dendritic morphology. In addition, we show that a basic motif within the p120ctn Arm repeat domain known to be required for the inhibition of RhoA is also required for binding to microtubules. We therefore propose that binding of p120ctn to microtubules is inversely related to its ability to regulate Rho GTPases. p120 catenin (p120ctn), an armadillo protein and component of the cadherin adhesion complex, has been found recently to induce a dendritic morphology by regulating Rho family GTPases.

In epithelial cells p120ctn localizes to adherens junctions by binding to the juxtamembrane domain of E-cadherin (2Staddon J.M. Smales C. Schulze C. Esch F.S. Rubin L.L. J.

In contrast to β- and γ-catenin, which act via α-catenin to link the E-cadherin complex to actin filaments, p120ctn does not appear to be involved in anchoring the E-cadherin complex to the actin cytoskeleton. Recently, p120ctn has been shown to have a supporting (7Myster S.H. Cavallo R. Anderson C.T. Fox D.T. Peifer M. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 160: 433-449Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar) but not essential role in Drosophila E-cadherin-mediated adhesion (7Myster S.H. Cavallo R. Anderson C.T. Fox D.T. Peifer M.

It is nevertheless believed that p120ctn is important for proper E-cadherin-mediated adhesion in mammalian cells, although whether it acts positively (9Yap A.S. Niessen C.M. Gumbiner B.M. J.

Nakagawa S. Reynolds A.B. Takeichi M. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 551-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar) to regulate E-cadherin clustering is not clear. p120ctn-binding may also have a stabilizing effect on the E-cadherin protein (13Ireton R.C. Davis M.A. van Hengel J. Mariner D.J. Barnes K. Thoreson M.A. Anastasiadis P.Z. Matrisian L. Bundy L.M. Sealy L. Gilbert B. van Roy F. Reynolds A.B. J.

Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 222-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (689) Google Scholar). p120ctn was originally identified as an Src tyrosine kinase substrate (15Reynolds A.B. Kanner S.B. Wang H.C. Parsons J.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 3951-3958Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar), and the Src phosphorylation sites have been mapped recently (16Mariner D.J. Anastasiadis P. Keilhack H. Bohmer F.D. Wang J. Reynolds A.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 28006-28013Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Tyrosine phosphorylation has been suggested to increase the affinity of p120ctn for cadherins (17Calautti E. Cabodi S. Stein P.L. Hatzfeld M. Kedersha N. Paolo Dotto G. J.

Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 461-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar), but the exact influence of tyrosine phosphorylation on p120ctn is unknown. p120ctn is also phosphorylated on a number of serine/threonine residues (12Aono S. Nakagawa S. Reynolds A.B. Takeichi M. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 551-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar, 19Downing J.R. Reynolds A.B.

The serine/threonine phosphorylation state of p120ctn correlates with its intracellular localization. Membrane-associated, E-cadherin-bound p120ctn is highly phosphorylated, whereas cytoplasmic p120ctn shows much reduced phosphorylation levels (10Thoreson M.A. Anastasiadis P.Z. Daniel J.M. Ireton R.C. Wheelock M.J. Johnson K.R. Hummingbird D.K. Reynolds A.B. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 189-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar), suggesting that p120ctn is phosphorylated by membrane-associated kinases. Serine phosphorylation events within the N terminus of p120ctn have been suggested to regulate E-cadherin clustering (12Aono S. Nakagawa S. Reynolds A.B. Takeichi M. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 551-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). In E-cadherin-deficient cancer cell lines, p120ctn is frequently observed in the nucleus (23van Hengel J. Vanhoenacker P. Staes K. van Roy F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 7980-7985Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar) where it may interact with the transcription factor Kaiso (24Daniel J.M. Reynolds A.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 3614-3623Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). Matrilysin/MMP7, a matrix metalloproteinase, has been implicated as a target gene for Kaiso (25Daniel J.M. Spring C.M. Crawford H.C. Reynolds A.B. Baig A. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 2911-2919Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar), but the significance of the p120ctn/Kaiso interaction remains to be established. In addition to its role in cadherin-mediated adhesion, p120ctn has recently been found to be a regulator of Rho family GTPases (26Anastasiadis P.Z. Reynolds A.B. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 604-610Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar), key players in coordinating a variety of cellular processes, including cell polarity, cell migration, and cell adhesion (27Ridley A.J. Trends Cell Biol. 2001; 11: 471-477Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (644) Google Scholar). Overexpression of p120ctn in fibroblasts induces a so-called “dendritic morphology,” characterized by the extension of branching dendrite-like protrusions (5Reynolds A.B. Daniel J.M. Mo Y.Y. Wu J. Zhang Z. Exp. Cell Res. 1996; 225: 328-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). The induction of a dendritic morphology by p120ctn involves inhibition of RhoA (28Anastasiadis P.Z. Moon S.Y. Thoreson M.A. Mariner D.J. Crawford H.C. Zheng Y. Reynolds A.B. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 637-644Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar) and activation of Rac and Cdc42 (29Grosheva I. Shtutman M. Elbaum M. Bershadsky A.D. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 695-707Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 30Noren N.K. Liu B.P. Burridge K. Kreft B. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 567-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar). p120ctn might inhibit RhoA via a direct interaction (28Anastasiadis P.Z. Moon S.Y. Thoreson M.A. Mariner D.J. Crawford H.C. Zheng Y. Reynolds A.B. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 637-644Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar), whereas the activation of Rac and Cdc42 has been suggested to occur via binding of the guanine nucleotide exchange factor Vav2 (30Noren N.K. Liu B.P. Burridge K. Kreft B. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 567-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar). The Arm repeat domain of p120ctn is required for the interaction with E-cadherin (4Daniel J.M. Reynolds A.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4819-4824Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). There is evidence that the Arm repeat domain is also involved in the inhibition of RhoA (28Anastasiadis P.Z. Moon S.Y. Thoreson M.A. Mariner D.J. Crawford H.C. Zheng Y. Reynolds A.B. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 637-644Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar), and cadherin-binding and Rho GTPase regulation have been proposed to be mutually exclusive events (30Noren N.K. Liu B.P. Burridge K. Kreft B. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 567-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar). We report here that p120ctn can associate with microtubules and that this requires a basic motif in the Arm repeat domain. Our results with different p120ctn mutants suggest that binding of p120ctn to microtubules is inversely related to its ability to regulate Rho GTPases. Cell Culture—MDA-MB-231 and COS-7 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% bovine fetal calf serum, penicillin (100 IU/ml), and streptomycin (100 μg/ml). For NIH 3T3 fibroblasts, fetal calf serum was substituted with donor calf serum. Cells were grown in a humidified atmosphere containing 10% CO2 (COS-7, NIH 3T3) or 5% CO2 (MDA-MB-231) and passaged every 3–4 days or before reaching confluency. Antibodies—The following antibodies were used: mouse anti-VSV glycoprotein clone P5D4, mouse monoclonal anti-β-tubulin TUB 2.1, mouse monoclonal anti-acetylated tubulin clone 6-11B-1, rabbit polyclonal anti-γ-tubulin (all Sigma), mouse monoclonal anti-p120ctn (Transduction Laboratories), rabbit anti-Rac1 (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.), fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated donkey anti-mouse IgG, Cy5-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (both Jackson ImmunoResearch), TRITC-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Southern Biotechnology Associates), and sheep horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (Amersham Biosciences). Transfection—For electroporation, COS-7 cells were grown in 15-cm tissue culture dishes to 95% confluency and split 1:2 the day before transfection. Plasmid DNA (10 μg) was electroporated into 2 × 107 cells in electroporation buffer (120 mm KCl, 10 mm K2PO4/KH2PO4, pH 7.6, 2 mm MgCl2, 25 mm Hepes, pH 7.6, 0.5% Ficoll 400) using a Bio-Rad Genepulser at 250 V, 960 millifarads. Subsequently, cells were diluted 1:100 in growth medium, and 0.5 ml of this dilution was added per 13-mm coverslip. For LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen) transfections, 5 × 104 MDA-MB-231 cells were seeded per coverslip in 4-well plates the day before transfection, and transfections were carried out according to the manufacturer's protocol. Polyfect (Qiagen) was used to transfect NIH 3T3 cells. Cells were seeded at 2–4 × 104 cells per coverslip in 4-well plates the day before transfection, and the transfection was performed following the manufacturer's instructions. Cells were left to express for 16 to 24 h before being lysed or fixed. Plasmid Construction—To introduce a VSV tag at the C terminus of p120ctn, p120ctn-GFP (30Noren N.K. Liu B.P. Burridge K. Kreft B. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 567-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar) was digested with BsmBI and EcoRI to yield a 2.4-kb fragment. Using primers p120VSVF (5′-CGC-TGA-GAA-CTTAGA-AGC-TGC-3′) and p120VSVR (5′-GCT-AGC-TAG-CAA-TCT-TCTGCA-TCA-AGG-GTG-CTC-C-3′), the C-terminal end of p120ctn was amplified, and the KpnI restriction site was replaced with an NheI site by PCR and then digested with BsmBI and NheI to produce a fragment containing the last 424 bases of p120ctn-1A, followed by the NheI site. The EcoRI/BsmBI and BsmBI/NheI fragments of p120ctn were then ligated in tandem into EcoRI/NheI-digested pW5 (pcDNA3, into which a VSV tag, preceded by an NheI site, had been incorporated, kindly provided by Dr. G. Cory). Changes of p120ctn amino acids 538/539 and 587 and deletion of amino acids 622–628 were performed using the QuickChange Site-directed Mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). The correct sequence of all constructs was verified by sequencing. Rac Pulldown Assay—NIH 3T3 cells were seeded at 5 × 105 cells in 10-cm tissue culture plates. After 24 h cells were transfected with pcDNA3 vector (control), p120ctn-VSV, or 538/539/587AAA-p120ctn-VSV using Polyfect transfection reagent. After expression for 24 h, cells were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), lysed in 0.5 ml of 1× Rac pulldown buffer ((RPB) 25 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 2% glycerol, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 mm NaF, 1 mm Na3VO4) and immediately centrifuged for 3 min at 13,000 × g. Soluble supernatant (50 μl) was kept to determine total Rac levels in the cell lysate; the rest of the supernatant was incubated with 10 μl of PAK-1-PBD-agarose beads (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.) for 1 h. For in vitro GTPγS/GDP loading of lysates as positive and negative controls, 20 μlof0.5 m EDTA, pH 8.8, and either GTPγS (final concentration 100 μm) or GDP (final concentration 1 mm) was added to 0.5 ml of lysate. After loading for 15 min at 30 °C, nucleotide exchange was stopped by adding MgCl2 to a final concentration of 60 mm, and Rac-GTP was precipitated by incubation of the loaded lysates with 10 μl of PAK-1-PBD-agarose beads at 4 °C for 30 min. All beads were washed 3 times in RBP and resuspended in SDS sample buffer. Protein concentrations of the lysates were determined by Bradford protein assay, and volumes containing equal amounts of proteins were loaded onto 10% polyacrylamide gels. Following SDS-PAGE and Western blotting, pulldown samples and lysate samples were probed with antibodies against Rac1. Membranes carrying the lysate samples were stripped and reprobed with antibodies to the VSV epitope to determine expression levels of the transfected p120ctn. Band intensities were quantitated using Quantity One software from Bio-Rad. Immunohistochemistry and Image Collection—Cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde/PBS for 20 min and permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100/PBS for 5 min. The cells were subsequently incubated for 1 h with primary antibodies (anti-VSV 1:1000, anti-β-tubulin 1:200, and anti-γ-tubulin 1:200, diluted in 0.5% bovine serum albumin/PBS) followed by incubation with secondary antibodies (fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-mouse 1:100, TRITC-conjugated anti-rabbit 1:100, and Cy5-conjugated anti-mouse 1:250) or with 1 μg/ml TRITC-phalloidin for 45 min and finally mounted in Mowiol (Calbiochem). Confocal laser-scanning microscopy was carried out with an LSM 510 (Zeiss, Welwyn Garden City, UK) mounted over an affinity-corrected Axioplan microscope (Zeiss) using a ×40 1.3 NA oil immersion objective. Specific Serine to Alanine Point Mutations in the Arm Domain Promote Association of p120ctn with Interphase Microtubules—We have recently identified several novel serine phosphorylation sites in p120ctn (32Thompson A.J. Hart S.R. Franz C. Barnouin K. Ridley A. Cramer R. Anal. Chem. 2003; 75: 3232-3243Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). As part of these studies, a number of candidate serine residues in the N and C terminus and in the Arm repeat domain of p120ctn were mutated to alanine residues. We did not detect any serine phosphorylation sites within the Arm repeat domain of p120ctn. However, expression of the constructs in COS-7 cells showed that two p120ctn mutants carrying serine to alanine mutations within the Arm repeat domains 4 and 5 (S538A/S539A and S587A) localized along interphase microtubules in ∼20% of transfected cells, whereas wild-type p120ctn did not localize to microtubules in these cells (Fig. 1, A and C). When the two mutations (S538A/S539A and S587A) were combined in one protein (S538A/S539A/S587A or AAA-p120ctn), the percentage of transfected COS-7 cells showing p120ctn/microtubule colocalization increased to ∼30% (Fig. 1, A and C). Proteins containing the single mutations S538A or S539A only rarely localized along microtubules (data not shown). Localization of AAA-p120ctn, but not wild-type p120ctn, along microtubules was also observed in the fibroblast cell lines, Swiss 3T3 cells (data not shown), and NIH 3T3 cells (see Fig. 4A). In these cells, AAA-p120ctn was associated with microtubules in more than 80% of transfected cells. The association of p120ctn with microtubules did not appear to depend primarily on the expression levels of the mutants. Cells expressing similar amounts of AAA-p120ctn (as judged by comparing fluorescence intensities of neighboring cells) showed either near-complete p120ctn/microtubule colocalization or diffuse cytoplasmic and sometimes nuclear distribution of p120ctn. In some COS-7 cells showing a low level of AAA-p120ctn expression, the staining for p120ctn along microtubules was not evenly distributed but was concentrated in distinctive puncta (Fig. 1B). The association of AAA-p120ctn with microtubules is likely to be indirect, as it did not coimmunoprecipitate with α- or β-tubulin nor was it enriched in a detergent-insoluble microtubule-containing cell fraction (data not shown).Fig. 4AAA-p120ctn does not cause branching in NIH 3T3 cells. A, NIH 3T3 cells were seeded at 2.5 × 104 cells per coverslip, grown for 24 h, and then transfected with 0.8 μg of wild-type (WT) p120ctn-VSV or AAA-p120ctn-VSV. Cells were fixed after 16 h and stained with anti-VSV antibodies. Representative images of cells expressing wild-type (WT) or AAA-p120ctn (AAA) are shown. Bar, 20 μm. B, to quantitate p120ctn-induced branching, images of at least 10 random fields of view per coverslip were collected. Transfected cells were counted as showing branching if they showed two or more cellular extensions each at least three times the diameter of the nucleus. Results are the average (±S.D.) of three independent experiments (p < 0.001).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) AAA-p120ctn and Endogenous p120ctn Localize to Centrosomes and the Mitotic Spindle during Mitosis—Association of AAA-p120ctn with tubulin-containing structures was not restricted to interphase microtubules. In COS-7 cells, AAA-p120ctn localized to both the mitotic spindle and to centrosomes during mitosis (Fig. 2A). Most of the exogenous p120ctn appeared to be associated with the mitotic spindle, but a fraction of mutant p120ctn showed a punctate localization around the circumference of the cell. In contrast to the clear localization to the two mitotic centrosomes, AAA-p120ctn could never be detected at the single interphase centrosome, suggesting that the association of p120ctn with centrosomes occurs exclusively during mitosis. Consistent with this observation, a fraction of endogenous p120ctn was detected at centrosomes or the pericentrosomal region in the breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-231 cells during mitosis (Fig. 2B). The recruitment of endogenous p120ctn to the centrosomes in these cells suggests a physiological role for the interaction of p120ctn with tubulin-containing structures during cell division. During interphase, no clearly defined centrosomes could be identified in these cells by γ-tubulin staining. It was therefore not possible to establish whether the p120ctn/centrosome association also occurs in interphase. Localization of endogenous p120ctn to centrosomes was not observed in COS-7 or NIH 3T3 cells, possibly because the expression level of p120ctn in these cells is too low to allow detection of a centrosome-associated pool. Association of p120ctn with Microtubules Leads to Their Stabilization—p120ctn association with microtubules changed their morphology; they formed long, thick, and curly bundles and were in some cases arranged in circles around the nucleus (Fig. 1A). This is in contrast with typical interphase microtubules in fibroblasts, which originate from the microtubule-organizing center and extend their (+) ends toward the plasma membrane. Microtubule bundling into large multifilament structures has been linked to microtubule stabilization (33Lee G. Rook S.L. J. Cell Sci. 1992; 102: 227-237Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). During their maturation from unstable, highly dynamic to stabilized microtubules, the α-tubulin subunit of the tubulin dimer undergoes a series of modifications (34Webster D.R. Borisy G.G. J. Cell Sci. 1989; 92: 57-65Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 35Webster D.R. Gundersen G.G. Bulinski J.C. Borisy G.G. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 265-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), such as acetylation of a C-terminal lysine. An anti-acetylated α-tubulin antibody was used to confirm that p120ctn binding to microtubules had a strong stabilizing effect on microtubules in MDAMB-231 cells (Fig. 3). Only a low level of acetylated tubulin was detected in untransfected cells or in cells transfected with GFP alone (Fig. 3A′), whereas the thick microtubule cables in the AAA-p120ctn-GFP expressing cells stained very strongly for acetylated tubulin (Fig. 3B′). Expression of wild-type p120ctn did not increase the level of acetylated α-tubulin in the body of the cell. Microtubules within the p120ctn-driven cellular extensions, however, showed strong staining for acetylated tubulin (Fig. 3C′), suggesting that wild-type p120ctn may stabilize microtubules exclusively in these extensions. AAA-p120ctn Does Not Induce a Dendritic Morphology or Activate Rac1—Overexpression of wild-type p120ctn is known to induce extension of protrusions (dendritic morphology) (5Reynolds A.B. Daniel J.M. Mo Y.Y. Wu J. Zhang Z. Exp. Cell Res. 1996; 225: 328-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). In contrast, AAA-p120ctn did not stimulate branching in COS-7 cells (Fig. 1A). Rather, cells expressing AAA-p120ctn appeared to be more spread than untransfected cells. The p120ctn-induced dendritic morphology is especially prominent in NIH 3T3 fibroblasts (5Reynolds A.B. Daniel J.M. Mo Y.Y. Wu J. Zhang Z. Exp. Cell Res. 1996; 225: 328-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar), and this cell line was therefore chosen to quantitate the ability of wild-type and AAA-p120ctn to induce dendritic extensions. In preliminary experiments, VSV-tagged p120ctn was found to be more potent in eliciting a dendritic morphology than p120ctn-GFP, although p120ctn-VSV and p120ctn-GFP showed the same intracellular distribution (data not shown). Consequently, wild-type p120ctn-VSV and AAA-p120ctn-VSV constructs were used to quantitate morphological responses. Overexpression of wild-type p120ctn-VSV induced a dendritic morphology in more than 70% of transfected cells (Fig. 4B). The cell body was highly constricted around the nucleus, and cells showed a number of long protrusions, some of which extended for more than 20 times the cell body. The ends of the extensions often showed extensive arborization reminiscent of dendritic spines. In contrast, AAA-p120ctn-VSV caused branching in less than 10% of transfected cells (Fig. 4B); those extensions that formed were short, and the cells appeared spread out (Fig. 4A). Overexpression of p120ctn in fibroblasts activates Rac and Cdc42 (29Grosheva I. Shtutman M. Elbaum M. Bershadsky A.D. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 695-707Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 30Noren N.K. Liu B.P. Burridge K. Kreft B. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 567-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar). Active Rac1 and Cdc42 are required for the p120ctn-induced branching; coexpressing dominant-negative versions of Rac1 or Cdc42 with p120ctn efficiently blocks branching (29Grosheva I. Shtutman M. Elbaum M. Bershadsky A.D. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 695-707Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 30Noren N.K. Liu B.P. Burridge K. Kreft B. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 567-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar). To determine whether the reason for the failure of AAA-p120ctn to induce branching is the loss of its ability to activate Rac1, Rac pulldown experiments were performed (36Sander E.E. van Delft S. ten Klooster J.P. Reid T. van der Kammen R.A. Michiels F. Collard J.G. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1385-1398Crossref PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar). NIH 3T3 cells were transiently transfected with either wild-type p120ctn-VSV, AAA-p120ctn-VSV, or with empty vector as a control. In a parallel transfection of p120ctn-GFP, the transfection efficiency was estimated to be between 50 and 70%. The pulldown experiments showed that wild-type p120ctn increased the levels of active Rac1 in the cells more than 2-fold (Fig. 5, A and B). AAA-p120ctn, however, did not raise active Rac1 levels significantly above the levels obtained when vector alone was transfected. Because of the level of transfection efficiency, the true level of Rac1 activation in response to wild-type p120ctn expression is underestimated in the pulldown experiments, which measure active Rac1 levels averaged over both transfected and untransfected cells. However, the difference in Rac1 activity between wild-type p120ctn and AAA-p120ctn-transfected cells was statistically highly significant (p < 0.01). These results suggest that mutant, microtubule-associated p120ctn fails to induce branching because it is unable to activate Rac1. Deletion of a Basic Motif in the Arm Repeat Domain of AAA-p120ctn Prevents Microtubule Association and Induction of the Dendritic Morphology—Association of AAA-p120ctn with microtubules coincided with the inability of this mutant to induce a dendritic morphology. To clarify further the relationship between microtubule binding and the dendritic morphology, we attempted to identify a region in p120ctn required for both functions. A cluster of lysines between p120ctn amino acids 622–628 (KKGKGKK), situated on a looped-out structure within Arm repeat 6 (1Anastasiadis P.Z. Reynolds A.B. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 1319-1334Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), has been shown to be required for p120ctn to induce a dendritic morphology in NIH 3T3 cells (28Anastasiadis P.Z. Moon S.Y. Thoreson M.A. Mariner D.J. Crawford H.C. Zheng Y. Reynolds A.B. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 637-644Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar). In agreement with this finding, wild-type p120ctn-GFP missing the basic motif between amino acids 622 and 628 (ΔK-p120ctn-GFP) did not induce a dendritic morphology in COS-7 cells (Fig. 6). To test if this basic motif is also involved in microtubule binding, amino acids 622–628 were deleted in the microtubule-targeted protein AAA-p120ctn-GFP (ΔK-AAA-p120ctn-GFP). Deletion of the basic motif completely prevented localization of AAA-p120ctn to microtubules in COS-7 cells (Fig. 6). Substitution of lysines 622/623 with isoleucines also blocked microtubule association, whereas p120ctn carrying isoleucines at positions 627/628 associated with microtubules to the same degree as AAA-p120ctn, showing that lysines 627/628 are not required for microtubule binding (data not shown). Therefore, parts of the basic motif are involved in both the interaction of p120ctn with microtubules and the induction of the Rho GTPase-dependent dendritic morphology. p120ctn is known to associate with adherens junctions, regulate the activity of Rho GTPases, and under some conditions translocate to the nucleus, but its association with microtubules has not been reported previously. We report here that p120ctn localization to microtubules is promoted by mutating three serines to alanines in the Arm repeat domain and is also dependent on a lysine-rich motif. Binding of p120ctn to microtubules and its ability to activate Rac and induce a dendritic morphology are mutually exclusive. The serines 538/539 and 587 mutated to alanines in AAA-p120ctn are highly conserved in p120ctn family members. In other Arm repeats of p120ctn, the consensus residue at the equivalent position is either serine or alanine (1Anastasiadis P.Z. Reynolds A.B. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 1319-1334Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), indicating that alanine residues at these positions are compatible with Ar"
https://openalex.org/W1984198277,"The N-terminal SH4 domain of Src family kinases is responsible for promoting membrane binding and plasma membrane targeting. Most Src family kinases contain an N-terminal Met-Gly-Cys consensus sequence that undergoes dual acylation with myristate and palmitate after removal of methionine. Previous studies of Src family kinase fatty acylation have relied on radiolabeling of cells with radioactive fatty acids. Although this method is useful for verifying that a given fatty acid is attached to a protein, it does not reveal whether other fatty acids or other modifying groups are attached to the protein. Here we use matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry to identify fatty acylated species of the Src family kinase Fyn. Our results reveal that Fyn is efficiently myristoylated and that some of the myristoylated proteins are also heterogeneously S-acylated with palmitate, palmitoleate, stearate, or oleate. Furthermore, we show for the first time that Fyn is trimethylated at lysine residues 7 and/or 9 within its N-terminal region. Both myristoylation and palmitoylation were required for methylation of Fyn. However, a general methylation inhibitor had no inhibitory effect on myristoylation and palmitoylation of Fyn, suggesting that methylation occurs after myristoylation and palmitoylation. Lysine mutants of Fyn that could not be methylated failed to promote cell adhesion and spreading, suggesting that methylation is important for Fyn function.

Nearly all Src family kinases (SFKs) 1The abbreviations used are: SFK, Src family kinase; IC13, 13-iodotridecanoic acid; IC16, 16-iodohexadecanoic acid; NMT, N-myristoyltransferase; MTA, 5′-deoxy-5′-methylthioadenosine; Tev, tobacco etch virus; MALDI-TOF, matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight; Ni-NTA, nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid; GFP, green fluorescent protein; EGFP, enhanced GFP; RIPA, radioimmune precipitation buffer; FBS, fetal bovine serum; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. contain an N-terminal Met-Gly-Cys consensus sequence that promotes dual fatty acylation with myristate and palmitate. After removal of Met, myristate is co-translationally attached to the N-terminal Gly-2 via amide linkage, whereas palmitoylation of Cys-3 occurs post-translationally via a thioester linkage (1Alland L.

To date, studies of acylation of SFKs have been based solely on incorporation of radioactive myristate or palmitate. No study has directly examined the nature of the attached fatty acids in vivo. We recently exploited mass spectrometry to identify S-acylated species of the palmitoylated protein neuromodulin (GAP43) (3Liang X. Lu Y. Neubert T.A. Resh M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 33032-33040Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Here we extend this approach to study the modifications on dually myristoylated and palmitoylated proteins, such as SFKs. Our results indicate that the SFK Fyn is efficiently myristoylated and that some of the myristoylated Fyn is also heterogeneously S-acylated with different dietary fatty acids. During the course of this study, we identified an additional modification on Fyn: trimethylation of a lysine residue(s). Protein methylation involves transfer of a methyl group from S-adenosylmethionine to arginine, lysine, histidine, or carboxyl groups on proteins. Recently, protein methylation has emerged as an intensively studied regulatory modification of proteins. For example, carboxyl methylation of Ras is important for plasma membrane localization of Ras proteins (4Bergo M.O. Leung G.K. Ambroziak P. Otto J.C. Casey P.J. Young S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17605-17610Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Most heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins contain multiple arginineglycine repeats and are methylated by protein arginine methyltransferases. Methylation of heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins is essential for proper localization and function in RNA transport (5Shen E.C. Henry M.F. Weiss V.H. Valentini S.R. Silver P.A. Lee M.S.

A number of proteins have been shown to be methylated at lysine residues, including histones, ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (8Klein R.R. Houtz R.L. Plant Mol.

Heard E. Spector D.L. Chinault A.C. Allis C.D. Nat. Genet. 2002; 30: 73-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar, 16Noma K Allis C.D. Grewal S.I. Science. 2001; 293: 1150-1155Crossref PubMed Scopus (605) Google Scholar). Most of the SFKs contain multiple lysine residues near their N termini. In the context of Src, these lysines are part of a basic patch that promotes electrostatic interactions with acidic phospholipids in the membrane bilayer (17Sigal C.T. Zhou W. Buser C.A.

Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 13093-13101Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). However, point mutations of individual lysines have revealed an additional role in myristoylation. For example, mutation of Lys-7 in v-Src greatly reduces myristoylation, membrane association, and transforming activity (19Kaplan J.M. Mardon G. Bishop J.M. Varmus H.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 2435-2441Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Studies from our laboratory have showed that mutation of Lys-7 and Lys-9 of Fyn reduced myristoylation and membrane association of Fyn (20van't Hof W. Resh M.D. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 377-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). These defects could be rescued by co-expression of exogenous N-myristoyltransferase (NMT). In this study, we demonstrate that the Src family kinase Fyn is methylated at lysine residues within its N-terminal region. Myristoylation and palmitoylation of Fyn are required for methylation. In contrast, treatment of cells with a general methylation inhibitor did not inhibit myristoylation and palmitoylation, suggesting that methylation of Fyn occurs after myristoylation and palmitoylation. Furthermore, we show that expression of EGFP fusion proteins containing wild type Fyn, but not the non-methylated mutants, promotes cell adhesion and spreading, suggesting that methylation of Fyn is essential for its proper localization and function. Materials—The following reagents were purchased as indicated: Tev protease (Invitrogen); Ni-NTA-agarose (Qiagen, Valencia, CA); defatted bovine serum albumin (Sigma); Na125I, l-[35S]methionine, l-[methyl-3H]methionine, and S-adenosyl-l-[methyl-3H]methionine (PerkinElmer Life Sciences); 5′-deoxy-5′-methylthioadenosine (MTA), and fibronectin (Calbiochem); and pEGFP-N1 (Clontech). Synthesis and radioiodination of the IC13 (13-iodotridecanoic acid) and IC16 (16-iodohexadecanoic acid) fatty acid analogs were performed as described previously (2Liang X. Nazarian A. Erdjument-Bromage H. Bornmann W. Tempst P. Resh M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30987-30994Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Mouse anti-Fyn antibody was obtained from BD Biosciences. Mouse anti-GFP antibody was purchased from Roche Applied Science. Texas Red-X phalloidin and Prolong mounting medium were purchased from Molecular Probes. The rabbit polyclonal antiserum to Fyn used for immunoprecipitation was described previously (21Wolven A. Okamura H. Rosenblatt Y. Resh M.D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 1159-1173Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Western blots were detected with ECL reagents (Amersham Biosciences). Plasmids—The Fyn16TevEGFPHis6 chimeric construct was prepared by fusing the sequences encoding the first 16 amino acids of Fyn to the 7-amino-acid (Glu-Asn-Leu-Tyr-Phe-Gln-Gly) cleavage site for Tev protease followed by EGFP. A hexa-his tag was then attached to the C terminus of Fyn16TevEGFP to facilitate protein purification. Full-length wild type Fyn and G2A, C3S,C6S, K7A, K9A, or K7A,K9A mutant Fyn were prepared as described previously (2Liang X. Nazarian A. Erdjument-Bromage H. Bornmann W. Tempst P. Resh M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30987-30994Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar, 20van't Hof W. Resh M.D. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 377-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). To prepare full-length FynEGFP fusion constructs, PCR products of wild type Fyn and G2A, C3S,C6S, K7A, K9A, or K7A,K9A mutants with the stop codon of Fyn deleted were inserted in-frame into EcoRI/BamHI-cut pEGFP-N1. All mutations were verified by DNA sequencing. Purification of Fyn Chimeric Proteins—Ten plates of COS-1 cells, maintained in DMEM medium supplemented with 10% FBS, were co-transfected with human NMT and Fyn16TevEGFPHis6 cDNAs at a 3:1 ratio using LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen). Two days after transfection, the cells were lysed in hypotonic buffer containing 20 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 0.2 mm MgCl2, and protease inhibitors. Pellets were harvested by centrifugation and extracted with RIPA buffer containing 20 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 500 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% deoxycholate, and 0.1% SDS (buffer A). After clarification by centrifugation, the detergent-insoluble pellets were further extracted with buffer A containing 8 m urea (buffer B). After centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 15 min, the supernatant was collected, diluted 4-fold with 20 mm Tris (pH 7.4), and loaded onto a 1-ml Ni-NTA column equilibrated previously with 4-fold diluted buffer B. After extensive washing, the column was eluted with 20 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 200 mm imidazole, 8 m urea. The protein was concentrated to ∼5–10 mg/ml with an Amicon concentrator, diluted 10-fold with 20 mm Tris buffer (pH 7.4), and digested with Tev protease. Protein purification and digestion were monitored by Western blotting. Mass Spectrometry—Molecular masses of digested peptides were determined at the New York University Protein Analysis Facility. The digestion mixture (0.5 μl) was mixed with 0.5 μl of 10 mg/ml cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid (Sigma) in 50% acetonitrile and 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, air-dried, and analyzed on a Micromass TofSpec-2E (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometer in reflectron mode using standard instrument settings. Internal and/or external calibration was carried out using angiotensin I (monoisotopic mass 1295.68 Da), a synthetic peptide of monoisotopic mass 2749.65 Da, and insulin (5732.61 Da). For post-source decay experiments, data were acquired over 12 equal segments of m/z values between 0 and 1120, with reflectron voltages varying between 1098 V (segment 12) to 26000 V (segment 1) using adrenocorticotropic hormone fragments 18–39 as external calibration standard. The post-source decay spectra were manually interpreted with the help of MassLynx software. Cell Adhesion, Spreading, and Immunofluorescence—COS-1 cells transfected with wild type and mutant full-length FynEGFP constructs were trypsinized and maintained in suspension for 1 h in DMEM medium containing 0.5% FBS. To measure cell adhesion, cells were counted, and aliquots were plated on fibronectin-coated dishes. After the indicated times, unattached cells were removed. The attached cells were then resuspended, harvested, and counted. The percentage of green cells in the original cell suspension and after resuspension of the attached cells was determined by fluorescence-activated cell sorter. These percentages were used to calculate the number of green cells in each sample. The percentage of cells attached to the dishes was then calculated by dividing the number of green cells attached to the dishes by the number of green cells in the original starting cell suspension. To examine cell spreading, cells were fixed for 15 min in 3.7% formaldehyde and permeabilized for 5 min in 0.2% Triton X-100. Actin filaments were labeled with Texas Red-X phalloidin, and nuclei were labeled with Hoechst. The cells were viewed using a Zeiss LSM510 confocal microscope. Cell Fractionation—Cells were resuspended in hypotonic buffer, lysed by homogenization with 30 strokes of a Dounce homogenizer, and centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h to obtain a cytosolic fraction (S100) and a membrane fraction (P100) as described (20van't Hof W.

Cell. 1997; 8: 1159-1173Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Cell Labeling—Cell labeling with IC13 and IC16 fatty acid analogs was carried out as described (21Wolven A. Okamura H. Rosenblatt Y. Resh M.D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 1159-1173Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 22van't Hof W. Resh M.D. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 1023-1035Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells expressing wild type full-length Fyn were incubated with Me2SO or 0.3 mm MTA for 30 min and then labeled for 2 h at 37 °C with 25–50 μCi/ml IC13 or IC16 in DMEM containing 2% dialyzed FBS and 0.5% defatted bovine serum albumin in the presence or absence of MTA. Cells were lysed in RIPA buffer. Rabbit anti-Fyn antibody was added to cell lysates, and immunocomplexes were analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by phosphorimaging (Amersham Biosciences) or Western blotting with mouse anti-Fyn antibody. Quantitation of the data from PhosphorImager screens was performed with ImageQuant software (Amersham Biosciences). Western blots were exposed to BioMax MR film (Eastman Kodak Co.), scanned with an Epson scanner, and quantitated with MacBAS software. Methylation labeling was carried out as described (23Liu Q. Dreyfuss G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2800-2808Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). COS-1 cells expressing wild type or mutant full-length Fyn were incubated with cycloheximide (100 μg/ml) and chloramphenicol (40 μg/ml) in growth medium for 30 min. The cells were washed once with DMEM medium without methionine and cysteine (DMEM-Met/Cys) and then labeled with 10 μCi/ml l-[methyl-3H]methionine for 3 h in DMEM-Met/Cys, containing cycloheximide (100 μg/ml), chloramphenicol (40 μg/ml), and 10% FBS. For some experiments, Me2SO or 0.3 mm MTA was added along with the protein synthesis inhibitors. Fluorograms were scanned and quantitated as described above. To test the effect of protein synthesis inhibitors, one 60-mm plate of COS-1 cells expressing full-length Fyn was incubated with DMEM containing cycloheximide (100 μg/ml) and chloramphenicol (40 μg/ml) for 30 min and then labeled for 3 h with 10 μCi/ml l-[35S]methionine in DMEM-Met/Cys with protein synthesis inhibitors. Another plate of cells with equal cell density was labeled with 10 μCi/ml l-[35S]methionine in the absence of protein synthesis inhibitors. Cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with rabbit anti-Fyn antibody and analyzed as described above. N-terminal Fatty Acylation of the Src Family Kinase Fyn— Mass spectrometry was used to examine the molecular identity of the fatty acid(s) attached to the N-terminal region of the Src family kinase Fyn. To minimize interference from internal proteolytic peptides, a chimeric GFP construct, Fyn16TevEGFP, was designed by inserting a specific Tev protease cleavage site after the N-terminal 16 residues of Fyn. A hexa-histidine tag was added at the C terminus to facilitate protein purification (Fig. 1A). Fyn16TevEGFPHis6 was coexpressed in COS-1 cells with human NMT to ensure that the amount of endogenous NMT would not be limiting. Cells were then lysed in hypotonic buffer. As expected, nearly all of Fyn16TevEGFPHis6 protein was present in the pellet. Interestingly, addition of RIPA buffer plus 8 m urea was required to completely solubilize the protein. When the pellet was extracted with RIPA buffer (pH 7.4), only 10% of the total Fyn16TevEGFPHis6 protein was solubilized as compared with the amount extracted with RIPA plus urea (Fig. 1B). The solubilized Fyn16TevEGFPHis6 protein was purified through a Ni-NTA-agarose affinity column with an 80% yield (Fig. 1B). The purified protein was concentrated and digested with Tev protease. Approximately 90% of the protein was cleaved based on the mobility shift observed by Western blotting with anti-GFP antibody (Fig. 1C). Analysis of the digestion mixture by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry revealed that Fyn16TevEGFPHis6 was efficiently myristoylated at the N-terminal glycine (Fig. 2). The calculated monoisotopic m/z of the protonated myristoylated Fyn N-terminal peptide with a disulfide bond (i.e. m/z of M+ H+) is 2655.34. A peak at m/z 2655.31 was observed, consistent with this peptide with an intramolecular disulfide between Cys-3 and Cys-6 (Fig. 2). The identity of the myristoylated peptide was confirmed by MALDI-TOF post-source decay sequence analysis (data not shown). The calculated monoisotopic mass of a protonated peptide that is both myristoylated and palmitoylated is 2895.58. As depicted in Fig. 2, a peak consistent with this peptide at m/z = 2895.55 was clearly observed. Interestingly, a peptide of m/z = 2893.58 was also apparent, which is exactly 2 Da less than the palmitoylated peptide, suggesting that Fyn16TevEGFPHis6 was heterogeneously acylated by palmitoleate or palmitate. A peak at m/z = 2923.55 was also detected, which is 28 Da larger than the palmitoylated peptide, suggesting that a small percentage of myristoylated Fyn peptides was acylated by stearate instead of palmitate. Close examination of the spectrum revealed the presence of a peptide of m/z 2921.52, consistent with the Fyn peptide modified by myristate and oleate. This agrees with our previous studies with radiolabeled fatty acids, which revealed that heterogeneous fatty acylation of Fyn (2Liang X. Nazarian A. Erdjument-Bromage H. Bornmann W. Tempst P. Resh M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30987-30994Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar) as well as GAP43 can occur (3Liang X. Lu Y. Neubert T.A. Resh M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 33032-33040Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). In addition, a small peak at m/z 3133.64 was also detectable, which corresponds to a peptide modified by one myristate and two palmitates. No peaks corresponding to the calculated m/z (2447.15) of unmodified Fyn N-terminal peptides were observed. Fyn16TevEGFPHis6 and Wild Type Full-length Fyn Are Methylated at Internal Lysine Residues—Most of the Src family tyrosine kinases contain multiple lysine residues within their N-terminal regions. Close examination of the mass spectra of the acylated peptides of Fyn16TevEGFPHis6 revealed several peaks that were 43 Da larger than the myristoylated or dually acylated peptides. The 43-Da increase in mass is consistent with trimethylation of a lysine residue(s) on the peptide. The peak at m/z = 2700.30 corresponds to a myristoylated and trimethylated peptide, whereas the peak at m/z = 2938.54 corresponds to a peptide modified by myristoyl, palmitoyl, and trimethyl groups. A small peak at m/z = 2743.37 was also detected, which is 43 Da more than the singly trimethylated peptide at 2700.30, suggesting that at least two lysines within the Fyn N-terminal region are trimethylated. We next performed an in vivo methylation assay to confirm Fyn methylation. This method is based on the fact that the methyl group donor S-adenosylmethionine is derived from free methionine in vivo. COS-1 cells expressing wild type or mutant full-length Fyn were incubated with l-[methyl-3H]methionine in the presence of protein synthesis inhibitors. Full-length Fyn proteins were immunoprecipitated, and the immunocomplexes were analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by Western blotting with mouse anti-Fyn antibody or fluorography to detect methylated Fyn proteins. As depicted in Fig. 3A, wild type full-length Fyn was found to be methylated in vivo under these conditions. To verify that the labeling was due to post-translational methylation, and not translational incorporation of l-[methyl-3H]methionine, cells were incubated with l-[35S]methionine in the absence or in the presence of protein synthesis inhibitors. As depicted in Fig. 3B, the inhibitors completely prevented incorporation of the 35S-Met label, indicating that protein synthesis was essentially blocked. Thus, [methyl-3H] radiolabel incorporation most likely represents Fyn protein modified by methylation, not newly synthesized protein. Interestingly, when the N-terminal Gly of full-length Fyn was mutated to Ala, which abolishes both myristoylation and palmitoylation, no tritium label was incorporated into G2AFyn. These results suggest that both myristoylation and palmitoylation are required for efficient methylation of Fyn, consistent with our observation that a trimethylated peptide without myristate or palmitate was not detected in the mass spectrum of Fyn. The C3S,C6S Fyn mutant, which is myristoylated but not palmitoylated, did not incorporate the [3H]methyl label. However, we did observe a myristoylated, trimethylated peptide (i.e. lacking palmitate) in Fig. 2. The reason for this discrepancy is not known but may be due to loss of palmitate during mass spectrometry analysis, a reduced level of [3H]methyl incorporation into C3S,C6S Fyn that is below the limits of detection by fluorography, or a requirement for the presence of cysteine residues at positions 3 and 6 for methylation. To identify which lysine residue(s) of full-length Fyn is methylated, lysines 7 and 9 were mutated to alanine, either separately or together, to generate (K7A)Fyn, (K9A)Fyn, and (K7A,K9A)Fyn mutants. As depicted in Fig. 3A, when Lys-7 or Lys-9 was mutated, methylation of Fyn was reduced to levels of 50 and 25%, respectively, as compared with wild type Fyn. When both Lys-7 and Lys-9 were mutated to Ala, methylation of Fyn was nearly completely inhibited, suggesting that lysine residues at positions 7 and/or 9 are the preferred sites for methylation of Fyn. These results are consistent with the observations from the mass spectrometric analysis. Methylation Is Not Required for Myristoylation and Palmitoylation of Fyn—We next tested whether MTA, a general inhibitor of protein methyl transferases (24Williams-Ashman H.G. Seidenfeld J. Galletti P. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1982; 31: 277-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar, 25Maher P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4244-4249Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), could inhibit methylation of wild type full-length Fyn. Cells were incubated with protein synthesis inhibitors in the presence or absence of MTA. As depicted in Fig. 4, MTA inhibited incorporation of the [3H]methyl radiolabel into Fyn by >50% based on quantitation of the scanned fluorogram. To determine whether methylation of Fyn affects myristoylation and/or palmitoylation, cells expressing wild type full-length Fyn were preincubated with MTA for 30 min and were then labeled with a myristate analog ([125I[IC13) or palmitate analog ([125I[IC16) for 2 h in the presence or absence of MTA. As depicted in Fig. 4, treatment of MTA had no apparent effect on incorporation of the labeled myristate (IC13) or palmitate (IC16) analog, implying that methylation occurs after myristoylation and palmitoylation. Since MTA only partially inhibited Fyn methylation, it remained possible that methylation of Fyn lysine(s) was important for fatty acylation of Fyn. We therefore directly examined the extent of myristoylation and palmitoylation of lysine mutants of Fyn. The (K7A,K9A)FynEGFP Mutant Is Efficiently Myristoylated and Palmitoylated when Coexpressed with NMT—NMT prefers substrates with lysine at position 7 in its substrates (26Maurer-Stroh S. Eisenhaber B. Eisenhaber F. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 317: 523-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar), and mutation of Lys-7 greatly reduces myristoylation of Src or Fyn (19Kaplan J.M. Mardon G. Bishop J.M. Varmus H.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 2435-2441Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 20van't Hof W. Resh M.D. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 377-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). This defect can be rescued by co-expression of exogenous NMT. We used this information to separate the role of Lys-7 in myristoylation from its role in methylation. Full-length wild type and (K7A,K9A)Fyn mutants fused to EGFP were generated, and the amounts of [125I[IC13 and [35S]methionine incorporation into each protein were compared. In the absence of exogenous NMT, (K7A,K9A)FynEGFP exhibited myristoylation levels that were 40–50% those of wild type FynEGFP. Co-expression of NMT dramatically increased myristoylation of (K7A,K9A)FynEGFP to 85% (±2%) that of wild type FynEGFP. Because myristoylation is required for palmitoylation of Fyn, we also assessed levels of [125I[IC16 incorporation. The (K7A,K9A)FynEGFP mutant, when co-expressed with NMT, exhibited IC16 incorporation levels that were 74% (±8%) of wild type FynEGFP. Despite the fact that (K7A,K9A)FynEGFP had nearly wild type levels of myristoylation and palmitoylation, membrane binding of this mutant was reduced as compared with that of wild type protein. In the presence of NMT, >95% of FynEGFP fractionated in the 100,000 × g P100 membrane pellet, whereas only 40% of the (K7A,K9A)FynEGFP mutant was in the P100 (Fig. 5A). Confocal imaging of cells expressing FynEGFP proteins revealed plasma membrane localization for both wild type and mutant constructs (Fig. 5B). However, there was also significant cytosolic staining evident in cells expressing K7A and K7A,K9A FynEGFP, consistent with the biochemical fractionation data. Taken together, these data suggest that methylation of lysines 7 and/or 9 is required, in addition to myristoylation and palmitoylation, for proper membrane targeting of FynEGFP. Lysine Mutants of FynEGFP Are Defective in Cell Adhesion and Spreading—A cell adhesion assay was employed to explore the function of Fyn methylation. COS-1 cells were co-transfected with NMT and wild type or lysine mutants of FynEGFP. Transfected cells were trypsinized, counted, and replated on fibronectin-coated dishes for various times. The unattached cells were then removed, and the attached cells were harvested and counted. The percentage of green cells in the original cell suspension and after resuspension of the attached cells was determined by fluorescence-activated cell sorter and used to determine the total number of green cells in each population. The percentage of cells attached was calculated by dividing the number of green cells attached to the dishes by the number of green cells in the original cell suspension. As depicted in Fig. 6A, expression of wild type FynEGFP promoted cell adhesion as compared with the GFP control. Mutation of lysine 7 or double mutation on lysines 7 and 9 greatly reduced the effect of FynEGFP-mediated cell adhesion, suggesting that methylation of FynEGFP is essential for its function in cell adhesion. It is not clear why the rates and extent of cell adhesion for the lysine mutants were lower than the control EGFP. One possibility is that these mutants function as dominant negative inhibitors of endogenous Fyn protein. To further characterize the function of Fyn in cell spreading, cells expressing wild type and mutant FynEGFP were replated on coverslips for 1 h. Cells were fixed and permeabilized, and the actin filaments were labeled with Texas Red-X phalloidin. Cells were visualized by fluorescence microscopy. As depicted in Fig. 6B, cells expressing GFP had few ruffles or other protrusions but exhibited stress fibers across the cell body. Cells expressing wild type FynEGFP had extensive lamellipodia and filopodia around the periphery of the cell but were nearly devoid of stress fibers. Furthermore, FynEGFP significantly overlapped with actin filaments at the leading edge of spreading cells, suggesting that Fyn is capable of rearranging the actin cytoskeleton. In contrast, the K7A and K7A,K9A mutant proteins were localized in the cytosol or intracellular membrane compartments. Cells expressing these mutants were significantly less able to extend membrane protrusions at the edge of spreading cells but were able to form stress fibers around the FynEGFP mutant proteins. These data suggest that lysines in the Fyn SH4 domain are essential for efficient plasma membrane targeting of Fyn as well as the function of Fyn in promoting formation of lamellipodia and filopodia. In summary, we have identified methylation as yet another modification within the N-terminal SH4 domain of Fyn. Myristoylation and palmitoylation were required for methylation of Fyn, suggesting that the Fyn methyltransferase is membrane-bound. It is interesting to compare the modifications in the N-terminal region of Fyn with those in the C-terminal region of Ras GTPases. Ras proteins are prenylated at the cysteine residue within the C-terminal CAAX box. The prenyl-CAAX motif is proteolytically cleaved, exposing the prenylcysteine as the new C terminus. This modified cysteine is then recognized by a prenylcysteine carboxyl methyltransferase that methylates the α-carboxyl group. Methylation of Ras is important for directing it to the plasma membrane, a finding analogous to our results with Fyn. However, it is likely that methylation may play a role beyond that of membrane targeting. Although the (K7A,K9A)FynEGFP mutant was myristoylated and palmitoylated to nearly wild type levels and exhibited significant plasma membrane localization (Fig. 5), this mutant was still severely impaired in its ability to promote cell adhesion. The defective functioning of the (K7A,K9A)FynEGFP mutant could be due to: decreased plasma membrane association, loss of the lysine residue(s) per se, loss of the positive charge imparted by the lysine residue(s), and/or loss of methylation. At the present time, the identity of the methyltransferase that methylates Fyn is not known, so it is not possible to specifically inhibit methylation of wild type Fyn. Substitution of lysine residues with arginine would not be useful, as arginines can also be methylated. Thus, it is not possible to definitely rule out a role for SH4 lysine residues per se. However, the experiments presented in this study identify methylation as a novel modification within the SH4 domain of Fyn and strongly suggest that methylation of Fyn may be important for both membrane targeting as well as Fyn function in cell adhesion and spreading."

Knopf J.L. Wozney J.M. Sultzman L.A. Buecker J.L. Pittman D.D. Kaufman R.J. Brown E. Shoemaker C. Orr E.C. Nature. 1984; 312: 342-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (665) Google Scholar, 2Vehar G.A. Keyt B.

The fVIII A domains share homology with the copper-binding protein ceruloplasmin (3Kane W.H. Davie E.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Zaitsev V. Card G. Moshkov K. Bax B. Ralph A. Lindley P. J. Biol. Inorg. Chem. 1996; 1: 15-23Crossref Scopus (354) Google Scholar). Before cell secretion, fVIII is cleaved at the B/ap-A3 domain junction into A1-A2-B (heavy chain) and ap-A3-C1-C2 (light chain) subunits. fVIII circulates in the plasma as an inactive heavy chain/light chain heterodimeric procofactor that is non-covalently bound to von Willebrand factor. Proteolytic activation of fVIII by thrombin results from cleavages at Arg-372 between the A1 and A2 domains, Arg-740 between the A2 and B domains, and Arg-1689 between the ap and A3 domains. During this process, the covalent linkage between the A1 and A2 domains is lost, and the B domain and 41-residue ap are released, producing a heterotrimeric, A1/A2/A3-C1-C2 subunit structure (6Lollar P. Parker C.G. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 666-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Genetic mutations leading to insufficient or defective fVIII are responsible for the sex-linked bleeding disorder hemophilia A, which affects 1 in 5,000–10,000 males worldwide. Hemophilia A treatment consists of intravenous administration of plasma-derived or recombinant fVIII protein, the cost of which can exceed $100,000 per patient-year (7Bohn R.L. Avorn J. Glynn R.J. Choodnovskiy I. Haschemeyer R. Aledort L.M. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1998; 79: 932-937Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The expense of recombinant fVIII products is partly due to manufacturing costs associated with inefficient production of fVIII in mammalian cell culture (8Garber K. Nat. Biotechnol. 2000; 18: 1133Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Extensive research has been conducted on the genetic and biochemical regulation of fVIII biosynthesis (for a review see Kaufman et al. (9Kaufman R.J. Pipe S.W. Tagliavacca L. Swaroop M. Moussalli M. Blood Coagul. Fibrinolysis. 1997; 8: 3-14PubMed Google Scholar)). Low level expression of endogenous fVIII has complicated the study of the regulation of fVIII expression in vivo. Consequently, most studies of fVIII biosynthesis have been performed in heterologous mammalian cell culture systems. Several factors have been proposed to limit fVIII expression, including transcriptional inhibition (10Koeberl D.D. Halbert C.L. Krumm A. Miller A.D. Hum.

Generation of Hybrid fVIII cDNAs—The synthesis of B domain-deleted human, porcine, and murine cDNA constructs, designated rhfVIII, rp-fVIII, and rm-fVIII, in the mammalian expression vector Re-Neo has been described previously (19Doering C.B.

These constructs contain a nucleotide sequence between the A2 and ap-A3 domains encoding a linker region of human, porcine, or murine origin (designated SQ, OL, or SQ, respectively), which includes the Arg-His-Gln-Arg recognition sequence for PACE/furin processing (24Seidah N.G.

Pease L.R. Biotechniques. 1990; 8: 528-535PubMed Google Scholar) using previously published procedures (27Healey J.F. Lubin I.M. Nakai H. Saenko E.L. Hoyer L.W. Scandella D. Lollar P. J. Biol.

SQ or OL linker sequences were added to previously described HP fVIII cDNA constructs (28Healey J.F. Barrow R.T. Tamim H.M. Lubin I.M. Shima M. Scandella D. Lollar P.

HP1 and HP22 contain the SQ sequence, whereas HP18 and HP30 contain the OL sequence. fVIII Expression—Transient expression of the fVIII constructs from COS-7 cells and stable expression from baby hamster kidney-derived (BHK-M) cells was performed as described previously (19Doering C.B. Healey J.F. Parker E.T. Barrow R.T. Lollar P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 38345-38349Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Briefly, COS-7 cells were grown to 70–80% confluence in 2-cm2 wells containing 1 ml of DMEM/F-12 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Cells were transfected using LipofectAMINE and a 2000:1 mass ratio of fVIII construct:luciferase plasmid DNA. Twenty-four hours after transfection the cells were rinsed twice with DPBS, and 0.5 ml of AIM V serum-free medium was added to each well. Transfection of BHK-M cells was performed using Lipofectin according to the manufacturer's instructions. Transfected cells were cultured for 10 days in the presence of DMEM/F-12 containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 500 μg/ml Geneticin. Geneticin-resistant clones were screened for fVIII production, seeded onto 2-cm2 wells, and grown to 80–90% confluence before being switched to 1 ml of AIM V serum-free medium. COS-7 or BHK-M cells were cultured in serum-free medium for 24 h before measurement of secreted fVIII coagulant activity as described below. Expression of fVIII from COS-7 cells was normalized to expression of luciferase activity, which was measured using a TD 20/20 luminometer (Turner Designs, Sunnyvale, CA). Factor VIII Assays—Measurements of fVIII activity were made by one-stage and two-stage coagulation assays in a ST art Coagulation Instrument (Diagnostica Stago, Asnieres, France) using human fVIII-deficient plasma as substrate as described previously (23Doering C.B. Parker E.T. Healey J.F. Craddock H.N. Barrow R.T. Lollar P. Thromb. Haemostasis. 2002; 88: 450-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The activation quotient is defined as the activity in the two-stage assay divided by the activity in the one-stage assay. fVIII mRNA Analysis—Measurement of steady-state fVIII RNA levels was performed by real-time reverse transcription (RT)-PCR analysis using the ABI 7000 Sequence Detection System and the ABI SYBR Green RT-PCR kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) as described previously (19Doering C.B. Healey J.F. Parker E.T. Barrow R.T. Lollar P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 38345-38349Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Briefly, reaction mixtures containing 1× SYBR Green PCR master mix, 300 μm forward and reverse oligonucleotide primers, 6.25 units of Multi-Scribe reverse transcriptase, and 5 ng of sample total RNA were incubated at 48 °C for 30 min followed by incubation at 95 °C for 10 min and 40 amplification cycles of 95 °C for 15 s and 60 °C for 1 min. Post-reaction dissociation curve analysis was performed to confirm correct target amplification. Absolute quantitation was achieved by linear regression and comparison to a standard curve generated using known quantities of in vitro transcribed human fVIII RNA. The number of fVIII transcripts per cell was calculated using a value of 35 μg of total RNA per 106 BHK-M cells. Metabolic Radiolabeling and fVIII Immunoprecipitation—BHK-M cells stably expressing rh-fVIII or HP47 were seeded onto 35-mm dishes and grown to 80–90% confluence at which point there were ∼8.5 × 105 cells/dish. Before radiolabeling the cells were incubated in methionine-free DMEM for 15 min. For radiolabeling, cells were incubated in methionine-free DMEM supplemented with 100 μCi/ml [35S]methionine (>1000 Ci/mmol), 25 mm HEPES, 110 μg/ml sodium pyruvate, and 2 mm glutamax for 20 min. Where indicated the cells were rinsed twice and incubated for 4 h in 1 ml of DMEM containing 15 μg/ml (100-fold excess) unlabeled methionine (chase period). Cell lysates were prepared by rinsing the cells twice in DPBS followed by the addition of 1 ml of M-PER protein extraction reagent containing Halt protease inhibitor mixture at the concentration specified by the manufacturer. Whole cell lysates were subjected to centrifugation at 12,000 × g. The resulting supernatants were used immediately in immunoprecipitation reactions or stored at -70 °C until use. After the 4-h chase period, conditioned medium was collected and subjected to centrifugation at 1000 × g for 15 min for removal of cell debris. Halt protease inhibitor mixture was added immediately to supernatants at the concentration specified by the manufacturer. Before immunoprecipitation, cell lysate and conditioned medium samples were pre-cleared by the addition of 25 μl of protein G-agarose and incubation at 4 °C for 1 h with gentle rocking. The protein G-agarose was removed by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 3 min. Next, 5 μg of ESH-8 or 4C7–1B murine monoclonal anti-human fVIII IgG was added to the supernatants followed by incubation at 4 °C for 1 h with gentle rocking. fVIII-containing immune complexes were precipitated by incubation with 50 μg of protein G-agarose at 4 °C overnight with gentle rocking. Protein G-agarose-immune complexes were collected by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 3 min followed by three consecutive washes with 1 ml of 1, 0.1, and 0.05% Triton X-100 in DPBS. Where indicated the final protein G-agarose pellets were re-suspended in 20 mm HEPES, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm CaCl2, 0.01% Tween 80, pH 7.4, before the addition of 10 units/ml porcine thrombin and incubation at 37 °C for 1 h. Bound proteins were eluted from protein G-agarose by the addition of 25 μl of SDS sample buffer and incubation at 95 °C for 10 min. Immunoprecipitated proteins were reduced and separated by SDS-PAGE, vacuum-dried to chromatography paper, and visualized by autoradiography using Kodak BioMax MR film. Quantitation of autoradiograph band intensities was performed using Un-Scan It software (Silk Scientific, Orem, UT). Purification and Characterization of HP47—HP47 was purified using a two-step ion-exchange chromatography procedure as described previously for the purification of rh-fVIII and rp-fVIII (19Doering C.B. Healey J.F. Parker E.T. Barrow R.T. Lollar P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 38345-38349Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) with the following modifications. Conditioned medium containing HP47 was loaded onto a 2.5 × 19.5-cm SP-Sepharose Fast Flow column equilibrated at 25 °C in 0.18 m NaCl, 20 mm HEPES, 5 mm CaCl2, 0.01% Tween 80, pH 7.4. HP47 was eluted using a linear 0.18–0.7 m NaCl gradient in the same buffer. fVIII-containing fractions were identified as described above by one-stage and two-stage activation quotient coagulation assays and SDS-PAGE. The specific activity of HP47 was calculated using a molar extinction coefficient determined from the absorbance at 280 nm and the predicted tyrosine, tryptophan, and cysteine content (31Pace C.N. Vajdos F. Fee L. Grimsley G. Gray T. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 2411-2423Crossref PubMed Scopus (3488) Google Scholar). The specific activity of the final material was defined as the weighted number average of the specific activities of the fVIII peak fractions excluding any fractions demonstrating an absorbance at 280 nm less than 0.08 or an activation quotient less than 20. Expression of HP fVIII Constructs—We previously found that a B domain-deleted porcine fVIII construct designated rp-fVIII was expressed at significantly higher levels than a B domain-deleted human fVIII designated rh-fVIII in COS-7 cells and BHK-M cells (19Doering C.B. Healey J.F. Parker E.T. Barrow R.T. Lollar P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 38345-38349Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). To identify the porcine fVIII domains that confer high level expression, we generated a panel of HP fVIII constructs (Fig. 1) and compared their heterologous expression capabilities in transiently transfected COS-7 cells and stably transfected BHK-M cells (Fig. 2, A and B, respectively). In COS-7 cells expression of rp-fVIII was 4.6 ± 1.2-fold higher than rh-fVIII (mean ± 1 S.D.). Expression of HP44, a construct containing the porcine A1, A2, and ap-A3 domain sequences, was 6.9 ± 1.2-fold higher than rh-fVIII and was slightly higher than expression of rp-fVIII (p = 0.03, Student's t test). In contrast, HP57, which contains the porcine C1 and C2 domain sequences, expressed similarly to rh-fVIII. Thus, the porcine A domains, but not the C domains, are responsible for the high level expression associated with porcine fVIII. Expression of HP47, which contains the porcine A1 and ap-A3 domain sequences, was 5.3 ± 0.75-fold greater than rh-fVIII and was not significantly different from rp-fVIII. HP46, a construct containing the porcine A1 domain sequence, expressed at a level intermediate between rh-fVIII and rp-fVIII. In contrast, HP1 and HP30, which contain the porcine A2 and ap-A3 domain sequences, respectively, expressed similarly to rh-fVIII. HP45, which contains the porcine A2 and ap-A3 domain sequences, expressed at a level intermediate between rh-fVIII and rp-fVIII. Results in BHK-M cells were largely consistent with the results in COS-7 cells. Average expression levels of rp-fVIII, HP44, and HP47 individual clonal cell lines were similar and were significantly higher than rh-fVIII (p < 0.001, p = 0.003 and p = 0.006, respectively, Mann-Whitney U test). In contrast, expression of HP46 was not significantly different from rh-fVIII expression (p = 0.34), although expression from the top-producing clone was ∼2-fold greater than the top-producing rh-fVIII clone (17 units/106 cells/24 h versus 9 units/106 cells/24 h). HP1 and HP30 expressed similarly to rh-fVIII. Taken together the results in COS-7 and BHK-M cells indicate that the porcine A1 and ap-A3 domains in HP fVIII cDNAs are necessary and sufficient to produce expression levels equivalent to rp-fVIII. Expression of MP fVIII Constructs—We previously showed that a recombinant B domain-deleted murine fVIII designated rm-fVIII expresses at lower levels than rh-fVIII in BHK-M cells (23Doering C.B. Parker E.T. Healey J.F. Craddock H.N. Barrow R.T. Lollar P. Thromb. Haemostasis. 2002; 88: 450-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Because the porcine A1 and ap-A3 domains confer high level expression in human/porcine fVIII hybrids, we wanted to address whether they increase expression when substituted into murine fVIII. A MP fVIII cDNA containing the porcine A1 and ap-A3 domains, MP6, was constructed, and its expression was compared with rm-fVIII in stably transfected BHK-M cells (Fig. 3). Expression of fVIII from the MP6 clones was significantly greater than from the corresponding rm-fVIII clones (p = 0.001, Mann-Whitney U test). Peak expression for the top-producing MP6 clone was 23 units/106 cells/24 h, compared with 0.5 units/106 cells/24 h for the top-producing rm-fVIII clone. Relative Expression Efficiency of Human, Porcine, and HP fVIII—Increased expression of porcine and HP fVIII constructs could be occurring through a differential at the mRNA, translational, or secretory level. Steady-state fVIII mRNA levels in the top expressing clonal cell lines were measured using quantitative real-time RT-PCR (Fig. 4). No correlation between fVIII activity and fVIII transcripts was observed. Further studies designed to uncover the mechanism driving the expression differential were performed using the stably transfected BHKM/rh-fVIII clone C7 and the BHK-M/HP47 clone F5. fVIII activity measurements and real-time RT-PCR analysis of the steady-state fVIII mRNA levels demonstrated that HP47 clone F5 expressed at a level 9-fold greater than rh-fVIII clone C7 despite the fact that HP47 clone F5 contained 0.7-fold the level of fVIII transcripts (Fig. 5A). Relative translational and secretory efficiencies of rh-fVIII and HP47 were determined by pulse-labeling cells for 20 min in medium containing [35S]methionine followed by a 4-h chase incubation in medium containing excess unlabeled methionine and immunoprecipitation using either anti-human fVIII heavy chain (4C7–1B)- or light chain (ESH-8)-specific murine monoclonal antibodies (Fig. 5, B and C). A band consistent with unprocessed, single chain fVIII was recovered from cell lysates after the pulse-labeling period. This band was not detected in the non-transfected, parental BHK-M cell line (data not shown). Quantitation of the single chain bands revealed rh-fVIII/HP47 ratios of 0.83 and 1.15 when either 4C7–1B or ESH-8, respectively, was used in the immunoprecipitation reaction (Fig. 5D). In both cases the differential was not statistically significant. After the chase period significantly less single chain HP47 material remained in the cell lysates (p = 0.005 and 0.04, for the 4C7–1B and ESH-8 immunoprecipitations, respectively). In contrast, the differentials between pulse and chase rh-fVIII levels were not significant (p = 0.55 and 0.1, for the 4C7–1B and ESH-8 immunoprecipitations, respectively). In addition to single chain fVIII, bands consistent with heavy and light chain fVIII were observed in the chase cell lysates (Fig. 5B). The identity of these bands was confirmed by subsequent thrombin proteolysis (data not shown). Interestingly, rh-fVIII light chain, but not HP47 light chain, was recovered from the 4C7–1B-immunoprecipitated samples despite the presence of 2.7-fold more HP47 heavy chain material. Additionally, rh-fVIII heavy chain, but not HP47 heavy chain, was recovered from the ESH-8-immunoprecipitated samples. In contrast to the 4C7–1B results, excess free light chain was not observed in the HP47 samples compared with the rh-fVIII samples. Consistent with the observed differential in intracellular single chain fVIII material recovered after the pulse and chase periods, immunoprecipitation of the conditioned medium with 4C7–1B and ESH-8 revealed the presence of 3.8- and 3.9-fold more HP47 than rhfVIII, respectively (Fig. 5, C and D). Rh-fVIII- and HP47-conditioned medium samples immunoprecipitated with 4C7–1B contained similar amounts of heavy and light chain, whereas identical samples immunoprecipitated with ESH-8 contained significantly more light chain than heavy chain material (p = 0.004 and 0.004, respectively).Fig. 5Characterization of fVIII biosynthesis in rh-fVIII- and HP47-expressing BHK-M cell lines. A, total RNA and conditioned medium from quadruplicate 35-mm culture dishes containing BHK-M/rh-fVIII clone C7 (solid bars) or BHK-M/HP47 clone F5 (hatched bars) were harvested and analyzed for fVIII mRNA and fVIII activity levels, respectively, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Data are expressed relative to BHK-M/rh-fVIII clone C7. B, BHK-M/rh-fVIII clone C7 (lanes 1–6) and BHK-M/HP47 clone F5 (lanes 7–12) cell lines were metabolically labeled with [35S]methionine for 20 min. Post-radiolabeling, cells in triplicate 35-mm culture dishes were harvested immediately (lanes 1–3 and 7–9) or switched to medium containing excess unlabeled methionine and incubated for 4 h (lanes 4–6 and 10–12). fVIII was immunoprecipitated from cell lysates using an anti-human fVIII heavy chain (top panel, 4C7–1B)- or light chain (bottom panel, ESH-8)-specific antibody. Proteins were resolved by reducing 7.5% SDS-PAGE as described under “Experimental Procedures,” Single chain (SC), heavy chain (HC), and light chain (LC) polypeptides are labeled. C, Rh-fVIII (lanes 1–3) and HP47 (lanes 4–6) were immunoprecipitated from conditioned medium after the 4-h chase incubation and resolved as described above. D, cell lysate pulse and chase single chain or secreted summed single/heavy/light chain autoradiograph band intensities for rh-fVIII (solid bars) and HP47 (hatched bars) are presented as the mean ± 1 S.D. relative to the mean value obtained for pulse-labeled rh-fVIII.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) It is possible that the mechanism governing the expression differential between BHK-M/rh-fVIII clone C6 and BHK-M/HP47 clone F5 results from genetic alterations that accumulated during the generation of these highly selected clonal cell lines. This possibility was addressed by repeating the radiolabeling experiments described above using mixed populations of 50–100 clonal cell lines stably transfected with the rh-fVIII or HP47 constructs and performing immunoprecipitations with 4C7–1B (Fig. 6). Rh-fVIII and HP47 were expressed from these cell populations at rates of 0.48 ± 0.12 and 2.37 ± 0.25 units/106 cells/24 h, respectively.

https://openalex.org/W2102601404,"Three variants of human β2-microglobulin (β2-m) were compared with wild-type protein. For two variants, namely the mutant R3Aβ2-m and the form devoid of the N-terminal tripeptide (ΔN3β2-m), a reduced unfolding free energy was measured compared with wild-type β2-m, whereas an increased stability was observed for the mutant H31Yβ2-m. The solution structure could be determined by 1H NMR spectroscopy and restrained modeling only for R3Aβ2-m that showed the same conformation as the parent species, except for deviations at the interstrand loops. Analogous conclusions were reached for H31Yβ2-m and ΔN3β2-m. Precipitation and unfolding were observed over time periods shorter than 4–6 weeks with all the variants and, sometimes, with wild-type protein. The rate of structured protein loss from solution as a result of precipitation and unfolding always showed pseudo-zeroth order kinetics. This and the failure to observe an unfolded species without precipitation suggest that a nucleated conformational conversion scheme should apply for β2-m fibrillogenesis. The mechanism is consistent with the previous and present results on β2-m amyloid transition, provided a nucleated oligomeric species be considered the stable intermediate of fibrillogenesis, the monomeric intermediate being the necessary transition step along the pathway from the native protein to the nucleated oligomer.

Over the last several years, an overwhelming number of reports have addressed the phenomenon of amyloidogenesis. The interest in the subject stems not only from the social relevance of amyloid pathologies such as Alzheimer's disease, or spongiform encephalopathy, or the various systemic amyloidoses, but also from the general implications in the issue of protein folding. Amyloidoses have been recognized as conformational diseases that arise from the conversion of globular proteins into insoluble fibrillar aggregates (1Merlini G. Bellotti V. N. Engl. J. Med. 2003; 349: 583-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (1448) Google Scholar). Despite the diversity of the involved proteins, amyloid fibrils exhibit a common structure known as cross-β structure, which appears to be a particularly stable, generic protein fold, accessible to many polypeptide chains under specific conditions in vitro and in vivo (2Dobson C.M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 329-332Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1701) Google Scholar). The amyloid deposition of β2-microglobulin (β2-m), 1The abbreviations used are: β2-m, β2-microglobulin; ΔN3β2-m, β2-microglobulin 4–99 fragment; ΔN6β2-m, β2-microglobulin 7–99 fragment; GdmCl, guanidinium chloride; MD, molecular dynamics; MHC-I, class I major histocompatibility complex; NCC, nucleated conformational conversion; NOESY, nuclear Overhauser spectroscopy; ppm, parts per million; r.m.s.d., root mean square deviation; TOCSY, total correlation spectroscopy; UHBD, University of Houston Brownian Dynamics; HLA, human leukocyte antigen. the nonpolymorphic light chain of the class I major histocompatibility complex (MHC-I), is associated to dialysis-related amyloidosis (3Gejyo F. Yamada T. Odani S. Nakagawa Y. Arakawa M. Kunitomo T. Kataoka H. Suzuki M. Hirasawa Y. Shirahama T. Cohen A.S. Schmid K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1985; 129: 701-706Crossref PubMed Scopus (867) Google Scholar). The disease is the result of long term hemodialysis in individuals with chronic renal failure, a widespread pathology with high social costs that are further increased by the inevitable dialysis-related amyloidosis complication. Recently ankylosing spondylitis has also been proposed to originate from β2-m deposition (4Uchanska-Ziegler B. Ziegler A. Trends Immunol. 2003; 24: 73-76Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). We determined the solution structure of isolated β2-m by NMR spectroscopy (5Verdone G. Corazza A. Viglino P. Pettirossi F. Giorgetti S. Mangione P. Andreola A. Stoppini M. Bellotti V. Esposito G. Protein Sci. 2002; 11: 487-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar) and showed that the most important rearrangements of the protein, with respect to its structure in MHC-I, were observed for strands D and E, interstrand loop D-E, and strand A, including the N-terminal segment. We stated that these modifications can be considered as the prodromes of the amyloid transition that starts at sheet 1 with the rupture of strand A pairing, and leads to polymerization, through intermolecular pairing at strand D and probably strand C, and precipitation into fibrils, i.e. according to the scheme we had proposed earlier from a comparative investigation on the full-length protein and the form devoid of the six N-terminal residues (ΔN6β2-m) (6Esposito G. Michelutti R. Verdone G. Viglino P. Hernández H. Robinson C.V. Amoresano A. Dal Piaz F. Monti M. Pucci P. Mangione P. Asti L. Stoppini M. Merlini G. Ferri G. Bellotti V. Protein Sci. 2000; 9: 831-845Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). This latter species, which accounts for ∼30% of β2-m content in ex vivo fibrils, had been shown to possess a higher tendency to self-aggregate than the full-length protein and to fail reaching a fully folded native state at the end of the refolding procedure (7Bellotti V. Stoppini M. Mangione P. Sunde M. Robinson C.V. Asti L. Brancaccio D. Ferri G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 258: 61-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Successive works reporting 1H-15N NMR studies of pH and urea-driven denaturation experiments (8McParland V.J. Kalverda A.P. Homans S.W. Radford S.E. Nat. Struct Biol. 2002; 9: 326-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar) and deuterium exchange of backbone amides (9Hoshino M. Katou H. Hagihara Y. Hasegawa K. Naiki H. Goto Y. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 332-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar) confirmed the amyloid pairing pattern of β2-m that was inferred from our former results (6Esposito G. Michelutti R. Verdone G. Viglino P. Hernández H. Robinson C.V. Amoresano A. Dal Piaz F. Monti M. Pucci P. Mangione P. Asti L. Stoppini M. Merlini G. Ferri G. Bellotti V. Protein Sci. 2000; 9: 831-845Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). Moreover, in analogy with the solution structure, even the crystal structure of isolated human β2-m has been claimed to reveal the clues to its amyloidogenic properties (10Trinh C.H. Smith D.P. Kalverda A.P. Phillips S.E. Radford S.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 9771-9776Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). However, the revelations that are disclosed by the crystal structure appear quite different from the elements of the solution structure that were recognized to forerun the amyloid transformation of β2-m and hence considered as prodromes of the process (5Verdone G. Corazza A. Viglino P. Pettirossi F. Giorgetti S. Mangione P. Andreola A. Stoppini M. Bellotti V. Esposito G. Protein Sci. 2002; 11: 487-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). To confirm and reinforce our model, we present here the results of the characterization by classical biochemical methods and 1H NMR of three variants of human β2-m, namely the truncated form ΔN3β2-m and the mutants R3Aβ2-m and H31Yβ2-m. These species were designed to test the role of some structural elements affecting the stability of the isolated wild-type protein in solution (5Verdone G. Corazza A. Viglino P. Pettirossi F.

Hernández H. Robinson C.V. Amoresano A. Dal Piaz F. Monti M. Pucci P. Mangione P. Asti L. Stoppini M. Merlini G. Ferri G. Bellotti V. Protein Sci. 2000; 9: 831-845Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). The truncated form corresponds to the wild-type protein devoid of the three N-terminal residues. In the mutants, the wild-type sequence residues in position 3 and 31, i.e. an arginyl and a histidyl residue, respectively, are replaced with an alanyl and a tyrosyl residue, respectively. Preparation of Recombinant Protein Samples—Expression and purification of recombinant proteins was carried out as previously reported for β2-m and ΔN6β2-m (6Esposito G. Michelutti R. Verdone G. Viglino P. Hernández H. Robinson C.V. Amoresano A. Dal Piaz F. Monti M. Pucci P. Mangione P. Asti L. Stoppini M. Merlini G. Ferri G. Bellotti V. Protein Sci. 2000; 9: 831-845Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). cDNA corresponding to the truncated species of β2-m lacking the first three (ΔN3β2-m) residues was accomplished by PCR amplification of the full length cDNA with the primers 5′-CGCACATATGACTCCAAAGATTCAGG and 3′-GCCGGATCCTTACATGTCTCGATCCCAC. Mutagenesis of His-31 into Tyr and Ser, and of Arg-3 into Ala were performed by using the QuikChange™ site-directed mutagenesis kit supplied by Stratagene (La Jolla, CA). The following primers were used: for H31Y, 5′-GCTATGTGTCTGGGTTTTATCCATCCGACATTGAAG and 3′-CTTCAATGTCGGATGGATAAAACCCAGACACATAGC; for H31S, 5′-GCTATGTGTCTGGGTTTTCTCCATCCGACATTGAAG and 3′-CTTCAATGTCGGATGGAGAAAACCCAGACACATAGC; for R3A, 5′-CGCACATATGATCCAGGCTACTCCAAAGATTCAGG and 3′-CCTTGAATCTTTGGAGTAGCCTGGATCATATGTGCG. The constructs were always introduced in the same BL21 Escherichia coli strain. A methionine residue was present at the N-terminal position of all recombinant products that will be referred to as Met-0. All the recombinant proteins gave a single species when assayed by electrospray-ionization mass spectrometry performed with ∼20 μm samples. The concentration of the protein samples was determined spectrophotometrically at 280 nm: A1 %1 cm = 16.17(β2-m), 16.29 (R3Aβ2-m), 16.24 (H31Sβ2-m), 17.21 (H31Yβ2-m), 16.73 (ΔN3β2-m), and 17.22 (ΔN6β2-m). Determination of Folding Stability—The thermodynamic stability was determined by monitoring the dependence of intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence on guanidinium chloride (GdmCl) concentration. Excitation was at 295 nm and emission monitored in the range 300–500 nm (11Tsunenaga M. Goto Y. Kawata Y. Hamaguchi K. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 6044-6051Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) using slit widths of 5 nm. The protein concentration of all samples was 25 μgml-1 in 20 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.3, with GdmCl concentrations ranging from 0 to 4 m. The protein/denaturant solutions were pre-equilibrated at 293 K for 20 min. Fluorescence spectra were obtained with a PerkinElmer LS50B spectrofluorimeter (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Experimental data were converted to the unfolded fraction using fU = (y - yN)/(yU - yN), where y is the value of the spectroscopic parameter observed at a given denaturant concentration, and yN and yU are the values of the native and unfolded protein, respectively, extrapolated from the pre- and post-transition base lines defined by a nonlinear least square fitting procedure (12Santoro M.M. Bolen D.W. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 8063-8068Crossref PubMed Scopus (1606) Google Scholar). The free energy of unfolding in the absence of the denaturant, ΔG°(H2O), and the denaturant concentration at the midpoint of the unfolding transition, Cm, were calculated according to the linear extrapolation model (13Pace C.N. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 131: 266-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (2420) Google Scholar) assuming a two-state transition. Kinetics Determinations—Folding and unfolding kinetics were monitored for β2m-wild type and mutants on a Bio-Logic SFM-300 stopped flow fluorimeter, by using an excitation wavelength of 295 nm and monitoring the total fluorescence emission change at 320 nm (14Chiti F. Mangione P. Andreola A. Giorgetti S. Stefani M. Dobson C.M. Bellotti V. Taddei N. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 307: 379-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 15Chiti F. De Lorenzi E. Grossi S.

All the experiments were performed at 303 K in 10 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, at a 0.02 mg ml-1 final protein concentration. The unfolding reactions were performed by a 10-fold dilution of a denaturant-free solution of each protein at 0.2 mg ml-1 with solutions containing various concentrations of GdmCl to obtain a final GdmCl molarity ranging from 2 to 5.4 m. The refolding experiments were performed by a 25-fold dilution of protein samples at 0.5 mg ml-1, unfolded in 4 m GdmCl, into final solutions containing denaturant concentrations from 0 to 1 m. Slow changes of fluorescence during folding were followed at 303 K by a PerkinElmer LS50B fluorimeter using excitation and emission wavelengths of 295 and 340 nm, respectively, with a 10-mm pathlength cell. For each protein, one volume of 0.2 mg ml-1 solution, denatured at equilibrium in 4 m GdmCl, was mixed with nine volumes of 10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.4. All the kinetic traces were fitted as previously described (14Chiti F. Mangione P. Andreola A. Giorgetti S. Stefani M. Dobson C.M. Bellotti V. Taddei N. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 307: 379-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 15Chiti F. De Lorenzi E. Grossi S. Mangione P. Giorgetti S. Caccialanza G. Dobson C.M. Merlini G. Ramponi G. Bellotti V. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 46714-46721Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). NMR Spectroscopy—NMR spectra were obtained at 500.13 MHz with a Bruker Avance spectrometer on 0.4–0.9 mm protein samples dissolved in H2O/D2O 90/10 and 95/5 or 99.9% D2O with 50–70 mm phosphate buffer, 50–100 mm NaCl, and pH* in the range 6.2–6.7 (pH* is the pH meter reading without isotope effect correction). When necessary, samples were centrifuged and/or filtered using filters with a threshold of 0.22 μm (Millipore, Bedford, MA). The studies were carried out at 310 K, with only a few experiments obtained at 298, 303, or 307 K with H31Yβ2-m for assignment controls. A number of two-dimensional TOCSY (16Braunschweiler L. Ernst R.R. J. Magn. Reson. 1983; 53: 521-528Crossref Scopus (3108) Google Scholar), double quantum-filtered correlation spectroscopy (17Piantini U. Sørensen O.W. Ernst R.R. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1982; 104: 6800-6801Crossref Scopus (1887) Google Scholar) and NOESY (18Jeener J. Meier B.H. Bachmann P. Ernst R.R. J. Chem. Phys. 1979; 71: 286-292Crossref Scopus (4838) Google Scholar) spectra were acquired. The adopted experimental schemes included solvent suppression by presaturation, or WATER-GATE (19Piotto M. Saudek V. Sklenar V. J. Biomol. NMR. 1992; 2: 661-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (3526) Google Scholar) and excitation sculpting (20Hwang T.L. Shaka A.J. J. Magn. Reson. 1995; 112: 275-279Crossref Scopus (1564) Google Scholar), 1–1.5-s steady state recovery time, mixing times (tm) of 13–50 ms for TOCSY and 50–150 ms for NOESY, t1 quadrature detection by time proportional phase incrementation (21Marion D. Wüthrich K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1983; 113: 967-974Crossref PubMed Scopus (3524) Google Scholar), or States method (22States D.J. Haberkorn R.A. Ruben D.J. J. Magn. Reson. 1982; 48: 286-292Google Scholar), or gradient-assisted coherence selection (echo-antiecho) (23Keeler J. Clowes R.T. Davis A.L. Laue E.D. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 239: 145-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). The spin-lock mixing of the TOCSY experiment was obtained with MLEV17 (24Bax A. Davis D.G. J. Magn. Reson. 1985; 65: 355-360Google Scholar) or DIPSI-2 (25Shaka A.J. Lee C.J. Pines A. J. Magn. Reson. 1988; 77: 274-293Google Scholar) pulse trains at γB2/2π = 7–10 kHz. The acquisitions were performed over a spectral width of 7002.801 Hz in both dimensions (or, sometimes, 8012.820 Hz), with matrix size of 1024–2048 points in t2 and 256–600 points in t1, and 32–128 scans each t1 FID. For the observation of very rapidly relaxing spin systems, the acquisition time was reduced in both dimensions by collecting data matrices of smaller size (512–1024 points in t2 and 128–256 points in t1). Precipitation was followed by collecting series of one-dimensional spectra, and sometimes also two-dimensional TOCSY, at regular time intervals over periods of 7–20 days. Acquisition conditions for two-dimensional data were the same as above reported, whereas for one-dimensional data time domains were set at 4096–8192 points, with relaxation delays of 1.1 or 10 s, depending on whether a steady or an equilibrium state integral was needed. Refolding of the wild-type protein was also followed by one-dimensional NMR measurements. After incubating at ambient temperature, for approximately 1 h, 1 mg of protein in 100 μl of 3.0 m GdmCl in D2O, the solution was transferred into the NMR tube and diluted 20-fold with the renaturing buffer (70 mm phosphate, 100 mm NaCl, in D2O, pH* = 7.5). The sample was then put into the magnet and, after quick equilibration and spectrometer adjustments, one-dimensional spectra were collected at regular intervals (1.5 min), at 298 K, using excitation sculpting (20Hwang T.L. Shaka A.J. J. Magn. Reson. 1995; 112: 275-279Crossref Scopus (1564) Google Scholar) to suppress the residual HOD peak, 2048 time-domain data points, 64 scans/experiment, and 8 dummy scans. The first acquisition was completed at 6.5 min from dilution, and, overall, the refolding kinetics was monitored by this real-time NMR approach for approximately 90 min. The achievement of a steady state was checked by recording spectra at higher intervals (>24 h) on the sample left in the magnet at the same initial conditions. Data processing and analysis were performed using Felix (Accelrys Inc., San Diego, CA) software with shifted (60–90°) square sinebell apodization, zero filling (up to 2048 × 2048 real points) and polynomial base-line correction for NOESY data. All ΔN3β2-m and R3Aβ2-m spectra were referenced on the Leu-23 CδH3 resonance at -0.58 ppm as previously reported (6Esposito G. Michelutti R. Verdone G. Viglino P. Hernández H. Robinson C.V. Amoresano A. Dal Piaz F. Monti M. Pucci P. Mangione P. Asti L. Stoppini M. Merlini G. Ferri G. Bellotti V. Protein Sci. 2000; 9: 831-845Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). For H31Yβ2-m spectra were referenced using the Leu-23 CδH3 resonance peak (–0.566 ppm at 310 K), whose chemical shift was determined at varying temperature with respect to internal dioxane (always at 3.750 ppm). Internuclear distances were quantified only for R3Aβ2-m from the NOESY cross-peak volumes of Trp-95, as previously reported (5Verdone G. Corazza A. Viglino P. Pettirossi F. Giorgetti S. Mangione P. Andreola A. Stoppini M. Bellotti V. Esposito G. Protein Sci. 2002; 11: 487-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Tethered molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were performed by using the Discover software (Accelrys Inc., San Diego, CA) and following the default protocol for simulated annealing (8.6-ps MD, 500 conjugate-gradient minimization steps) (26Dayringer H.E. Tramontano A. Sprang S.R. Fletterick R.J. J. Mol. Graphics. 1986; 6: 82-87Crossref Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Molecular structures were generated with InsightII (Accelrys Inc., San Diego, CA), MOLMOL (27Koradi R. Billeter M. Wüthrich K. J. Mol. Graphics. 1996; 14: 51-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (6489) Google Scholar), and Swiss-PdbViewer (www.expasy.ch/spdbv/mainpage.html). pKa and Free Energy Calculations—The electrostatic contributions to free energy were computed with the UHBD (University of Houston Brownian Dynamics) program, which is capable of solving the linearized Poisson-Boltzmann equation using a finite-difference method (28Madura J.D. Briggs J.M. Wade R.C. Davis M.E. Luty B.A. Ilin A. Antosiewicz J. Gilson M.K. Bagheri B. Scott L.R. McCammon J.A. Computer Phys. Commun. 1995; 91: 57-95Crossref Scopus (592) Google Scholar) in a continuum solvent model. The pKa values for the ionizable residues of the protein and the related electrostatic free energy contributions (ΔGel) were calculated according the methodology of Antosiewicz (29Antosiewicz J. McCammon J.A. Gilson M.K. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 238: 415-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (759) Google Scholar, 30Fogolari F. Ragona L. Licciardi S. Romagnoli S. Michelutti R. Ugolini R. Molinari H. Proteins. 2000; 39: 317-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The solvation contribution to the free energy of protein folding (ΔGsol) was calculated according to Eisenberg et al. (31Eisenberg D. McLachlan A.D. Nature. 1986; 319: 199-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (1700) Google Scholar) with a routine implemented in the program Tinker (J. W. Ponder, Washington University School of Medicine, Saint Louis, MO). The method is semiempirical and calculates, for every atom i, the free energy of transfer, ΔGi, from the environment of the protein interior to solution, according to ΔGi = ΔσiAi, where Δσi is the atomic solvation parameter (31Eisenberg D. McLachlan A.D. Nature. 1986; 319: 199-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (1700) Google Scholar) and Ai is the accessible surface area of the atom. The total ΔGsol for the protein is obtained by summing over all protein atoms. GdmCl Denaturation—The denaturation of wild-type and variant β2-m species was measured from the changes in fluorescence upon addition of GdmCl, and the results are presented in Table I and Fig. 1. ΔN6β2-m appears to be the least stable species followed by ΔN3β2-m and R3Aβ2-m, which show intermediate ΔG° and Cm values between wild type and ΔN6β2-m. The alanyl substitution for arginyl in position 3 destabilizes the molecule by 0.4 kcal mol-1, whereas the truncation at the same location destabilizes by 1.9 kcal mol-1. On the other hand, the presence of a tyrosyl residue in position 31 stabilizes β2-m by 1.5 kcal mol-1, in qualitative agreement with the result obtained for the β2-m His-31 → Phe mutant (2.6 kcal mol-1 stabilization under different conditions (Ref. 32Eakin C.M. Knight J.D. Morgan C.J. Gelfand M.A. Miranker A.D. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 10646-11065Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar)), whereas the introduction of a serine in the same position results in a reduced stabilization (6.9 kcal mol-1).Table IThemodynamic stability parameters obtained for wild-type β2-m and variantsb2-m variantCmaColumn shows denaturant concentration at the midpoint of the unfolding transition[GdmCl]ΔG°(H2O)bColumn shows free energy of unfolding in the absence of denaturant at 293 K and pH = 7.3kcal mol-1Wild-type β2-m2.36.3 ± 0.2H31Yβ2-m2.97.8 ± 0.4H31Sβ2-m2.56.9 ± 0.3R3Aβ2-m2.25.9 ± 0.2ΔN3β2-m1.94.4 ± 0.2ΔN6β2-m1.653.78 ± 0.09a Column shows denaturant concentration at the midpoint of the unfolding transitionb Column shows free energy of unfolding in the absence of denaturant at 293 K and pH = 7.3 Open table in a new tab Unfolding/Refolding Kinetics—In wild-type β2-m, the refolding pathway is characterized by three phases, the slowest of which has a rate constant of 0.0032 ± 0.0005 s-1 (14Chiti F. Mangione P. Andreola A. Giorgetti S. Stefani M. Dobson C.M. Bellotti V. Taddei N. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 307: 379-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). This slow refolding phase of β2-m was also investigated by real-time NMR. The spectra collected within the first 30 min from dilution with phosphate buffer of the GdmCl solution exhibited progressive changes toward the typical resonance pattern of the folded protein. A few resolved peaks appear to evolve in the upfield and aromatic regions (Fig. 2). In particular, the Ile-35 δ-methyl signal and the upfield-shifted Hβ resonance of Leu-23 slowly grow up to the final intensity, whereas the γ-methyls of Val-37 seem to increase at the expense of another pair of signals that, most likely, arise from the methyls of the same residue in a different geometry within a transient conformer of the molecule. Simultaneous changes observed in the aromatic region involve the ring resonances of Tyr-66, Phe-30 and Phe-70, and Trp-95, i.e. the aromatic groups that are largely responsible for the upfield shifts of Val-37, Ile-35, and Leu-23, respectively. Overall, the NMR pattern suggests that a rearrangement of the hydrophobic core takes place throughout the slow refolding phase of β2-m, consistently with the corresponding increase of 8-anilino-1-naphthalene sulfonic acid binding and changes in fluorescence and circular dichroism pattern, previously observed during the same refolding phase (14Chiti F. Mangione P. Andreola A. Giorgetti S. Stefani M. Dobson C.M. Bellotti V. Taddei N. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 307: 379-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Based on the NMR data, the rearrangement process involves a transient conformer that slowly converts into the stable, native form of the protein, with no evidence in favor of an equilibrium between the two species (15Chiti F. De Lorenzi E. Grossi S. Mangione P. Giorgetti S. Caccialanza G. Dobson C.M. Merlini G. Ramponi G. Bellotti V. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 46714-46721Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). The persistence of some 14 ± 8% of total protein in the refolding intermediate conformation (I2) (15Chiti F. De Lorenzi E. Grossi S. Mangione P. Giorgetti S. Caccialanza G. Dobson C.M. Merlini G. Ramponi G. Bellotti V. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 46714-46721Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar) could not be confirmed, although the occurrence of smaller amounts of the same species, i.e. below 2–3%, cannot be ruled out in principle because such small quantities would be hardly detectable by NMR. Likewise, we cannot exclude possible equilibria involving spectroscopically silent species (14Chiti F. Mangione P. Andreola A. Giorgetti S. Stefani M. Dobson C.M. Bellotti V. Taddei N. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 307: 379-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar), which for NMR would be either species with unresolved signals buried under the main envelope, or large aggregates with very broad linewidths, in any case other than the slowly converting form observed during refolding. As for the mutants, the increased folding stability of H31Yβ2-m and H31Sβ2-m prompted us to investigate the effect of the mutation on unfolding/refolding kinetics. Although the H31Yβ2-m very fast and fast folding kinetics phases are comparable with those of wild-type β2-m, a remarkable difference was appreciated for the slow phase that displays a rate constant of 0.031 s-1 for H31Yβ2-m (Fig. 3), i.e. 10 times faster than the value reported for the wild-type species (14Chiti F. Mangione P. Andreola A. Giorgetti S. Stefani M. Dobson C.M. Bellotti V. Taddei N. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 307: 379-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Preliminary results show that the slow folding phase of the H31S mutant exhibits a rate constant of 0.0043 ± 0.0006 very close to that of the wild type protein. A lower unfolding rate constant for H31Yβ2-m (6.9 ± 1.2 × 10-5 s-1) with respect to the wild-type protein (4.9 ± 1.8 10-4 s-1) is in perfect agreement with the increased stability of the mutant at equilibrium. NMR Characterization—The detailed interpretation of the 1H NMR spectra of the mutants and fragments of β2-m, based on the parent spectrum of the wild-type species, is far from being trivial. As already observed with ΔN6β2-m (6Esposito G. Michelutti R. Verdone G. Viglino P. Hernández H. Robinson C.V. Amoresano A. Dal Piaz F. Monti M. Pucci P. Mangione P. Asti L. Stoppini M. Merlini G. Ferri G. Bellotti V. Protein Sci. 2000; 9: 831-845Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar), the task requires checking and redetermining most of the resonance assignments of the variant under investigation according to the standard methodology, i.e. going through scalar and dipolar connectivity pattern for each amino acid residue (33Wüthrich K. NMR Spectroscopy of Proteins and Nucleic Acids. Wiley & Sons, New York1986Google Scholar). This work was performed entirely for the truncated fragment ΔN3β2-m and the two mutants R3Aβ2-m and H31Yβ2-m. The corresponding assignment lists are available at the BioMagRes data bank (entry points 5782, 5783, and 5784). The relevant differences of Hα chemical shifts (ΔδHα) with respect to the corresponding values of wild-type protein are shown in Fig. 4. For the sake of comparison, the ΔN3β2-m and R3Aβ2-m data (Fig. 4A) are not plotted in the same panel as those of H31Yβ2-m (Fig. 4B) because of the gaps in the assignment list of the latter mutant. The backbone resonances within fragments 29–34, 57–58, and 60–62 of H31Yβ2-m could not be observed in the NMR spectrum (either totally or partially for residues 58 and 62) because of exchange broadening."

Genetic manipulation of LPL may be beneficial in the treatment of hypertriglyceridemias, but it is unknown whether increased LPL activity may be effective in lowering plasma cholesterol and improving insulin resistance in familial hypercholesterolemic patients. To test the hypothesis that stimulation of LPL expression may be used as an adjunctive therapy for treatment of homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia, we have generated transgenic (Tg) Watanabe heritable hyperlipidemic (WHHL) rabbits that overexpress the human LPL transgene and compared their plasma lipid levels, glucose metabolism, and body fat accumulation with those of non-Tg WHHL rabbits. Overexpression of LPL dramatically ameliorated hypertriglyceridemia in Tg WHHL rabbits. Furthermore, increased LPL activity in male Tg WHHL rabbits also corrected hypercholesterolemia (544 ± 52 in non-Tg versus 227 ± 29 mg/dl in Tg, p < 0.01) and reduced body fat accumulation by 61% (323 ± 27 in non-Tg versus 125 ± 21ginTg, p < 0.01), suggesting that LPL plays an important role in mediating plasma cholesterol homeostasis and adipose accumulation. In addition, overexpression of LPL significantly suppressed high fat diet-induced obesity and insulin resistance in Tg WHHL rabbits. These results imply that systemic elevation of LPL expression may be potentially useful for the treatment of hyperlipidemias, obesity, and insulin resistance.

Through the hydrolysis of TG in these particles, LPL converts these lipoproteins to small, dense particles and results in the generation of surface remnants, which give rise to high density lipoproteins (HDL). This process also generates free fatty acids (FFA), which are taken up and used for metabolic energy in peripheral tissues such as muscle or reesterified into TG and stored in adipose tissue. Therefore, LPL is an important mediator for maintaining whole body energy homeostasis and fat accumulation in adipose tissue (4Zechner R. Curr. Opin.

LPL is mainly produced by mesenchymal cells such as adipose and muscle cells and then transported to the luminal surface of the vascular endothelium, where it is bound to heparan sulfate proteoglycans. In addition, small amounts of LPL are secreted from other tissues such as adrenals, kidneys, pancreatic islet cells, and macrophages (4Zechner R. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 1997; 8: 77-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). In humans, patients who are homozygous or heterozygous for LPL gene mutations show elevated plasma TG and reduced HDL levels (2Brunzell J. Scriver C. Beaudet A. Sly W. Valle D. The Metabolic and Molecular Basis of Inherited Diseases. McGraw-Hill, New York1995: 1913-1932Google Scholar), which in some cases are associated with premature atherosclerosis (6Benlian P.

Similarly, administration of drugs (NO-1886 or fenofibrate) that enhance the action of LPL resulted in lowering plasma TG levels, improved the capacity to handle fat load, and increased HDL-cholesterol (HDL-C) levels in rats and rabbits (11Tsutsumi K.

Patients deficient in LPL have hypertriglyceridemia and high levels of plasma FFA, which may cause insulin resistance and diabetes and can be ameliorated through lowering of TG (17Mingrone G. Henriksen F.L. Greco A.V. Krogh L.N. Capristo E. Gastaldelli A. Castagneto M. Ferrannini E. Gasbarrini G. Beck-Nielsen H. Diabetes. 1999; 48: 1258-1263Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Despite these beneficial effects on hyperlipidemias, tissue-specific dysfunction of LPL expression has been implicated in the pathogenesis of myopathies and obesity (4Zechner R. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 1997; 8: 77-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 5Zechner R. Strauss J. Frank S. Wagner E. Hofmann W. Kratky D. Hiden M. Levak-Frank S. Int. J. Obes. Relat. Metab.

Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 976-986Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). For example, increased LPL in muscle and liver in Tg mice may lead to the over-production of FFA, accumulation of TG, and subsequent impairment of the insulin signaling, resulting in a state of insulin resistance (19Kim J.K. Fillmore J.J. Chen Y. Yu C. Moore I.K. Pypaert M. Lutz E.P. Kako Y. Velez-Carrasco W. Goldberg I.J. Breslow J.L. Shulman G.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 7522-7527Crossref PubMed Scopus (589) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is still controversial, when LPL is within the physiological range, whether “the higher, the better or the lower, the better” holds in terms of systemic LPL activity in glucose metabolism and adipose accumulation. In addition, it remains unclear whether elevation of LPL can be used as a therapeutic method to treat hyperlipidemias, diabetes, and obesity or whether it is safe to use LPL-raising agents in hyperlipidemic patients with insulin resistance or diabetes. To investigate the physiological functions of LPL in vivo, we generated Tg rabbits expressing human LPL (hLPL) and reported that overexpression of LPL has multiple effects on atherosclerosis and hyperlipidemias (14Fan J. Unoki H. Kojima N. Sun H. Shimoyamada H. Deng H. Okazaki M. Shikama H. Yamada N. Watanabe T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 40071-40079Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Recently, we found that overexpression of LPL inhibited obesity in high fat diet-fed rabbits. 2S. Kitajima, M. Morimoto, T. Koike, and J. Fan, unpublished observations. Based on these observations, we proposed that increased LPL activity may increase insulin sensitivity and subsequently improve insulin resistance in hyperlipidemic and diabetic states. In this study, we cross-bred hLPL Tg rabbits with LDL receptor-deficient Watanabe heritable hyperlipidemic (WHHL) rabbits, a model of human familial hypercholesterolemia (20Watanabe Y. Atherosclerosis. 1980; 36: 261-268Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar). WHHL rabbits developed spontaneous hypertriglyceridemia, hypercholesterolemia, atherosclerosis, and myocardial infarction accompanied by hyperinsulinemia (21Zhang B. Saku K. Hirata K. Liu R. Tateishi K. Yamamoto K. Arakawa K. Atherosclerosis. 1991; 91: 277-278Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 22Shiomi M. Ito T. Yamada S. Kawashima S. Fan J. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2003; 23: 1239-1244Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar), which may mimic the features of metabolic syndrome in humans. We hypothesized that overexpression of LPL may improve hyperlipidemia and insulin resistance in WHHL rabbits. The current study using LPL Tg WHHL rabbits was designed with two goals in mind: (i) to study the effects of increased LPL activity on both hypertriglyceridemia and hypercholesterolemia and (ii) to determine whether high LPL would influence insulin sensitivity and adiposity in the absence of LDL receptor functions. We found that increased LPL activity essentially corrected hypertriglyceridemias in WHHL rabbits but had a gender-dependent effect on cholesterol metabolism and fat accumulation. Generation of Human LPL Transgenic WHHL Rabbits—The generation of Tg rabbits expressing hLPL under the control of the chicken β-actin promoter has been described previously (14Fan J. Unoki H. Kojima N. Sun H. Shimoyamada H. Deng H. Okazaki M. Shikama H. Yamada N. Watanabe T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 40071-40079Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). In this study, hemizygous LPL Tg rabbits were cross-bred with the same colony of homozygous WHHL rabbits used in the previous study (23Fan J. Challah M. Shimoyamada H. Shiomi M. Marcovina S. Watanabe T. J. Lipid Res. 2000; 41: 1004-1012Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). By serial breeding, we obtained two groups of Tg WHHL rabbits differing in their LDL receptor (LDLr) status: heterozygous Tg WHHL rabbits (hLPL/LDLr+/–) and homozygous Tg WHHL rabbits (hLPL/LDLr–/–). LDLr genotype status was examined by the PCR method developed by Brousseau et al. (24Brousseau M. Wang J. Demonsky Jr., S.J. Vaisman B.L. Talley G.D. Santamarina-Fojo S. Brewer Jr., H.B. Hoeg J.M. J. Lipid Res. 1998; 39: 1558-1567Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The presence of the hLPL transgene was confirmed by PCR analysis using the primers 5′-CAT TGC AGG TCT AGC C-3′ and 5′-GGA TTC CAA TGC TTC GAC C-3′. All animal experiments were performed with the approval and according to the guidelines of the Animal Research Committee of the University of Tsukuba. Northern Blot Analysis—Total RNA was isolated from adipose tissues and skeletal muscles of Tg and non-Tg WHHL rabbits. Ten micrograms of RNA was denatured in the presence of dimethyl sulfoxide and glyoxal and was then subjected to electrophoresis in a 1.2% agarose gel and transferred to a Nytran nylon membrane (Schleicher & Schuell). The membrane was hybridized in turn with the 32P-labeled hLPL, rabbit LPL, rat PPAR-γ2 and -δ, and hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL) cDNA probes (14Fan J. Unoki H. Kojima N. Sun H. Shimoyamada H. Deng H. Okazaki M. Shikama H. Yamada N. Watanabe T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 40071-40079Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The blots were scanned using an imaging densitometer (GS-710, Bio-Rad). Analysis of LPL Protein and Enzymatic Activity—Post-heparin plasma was prepared from a blood sample taken 10 min after a bolus injection of heparin at a dose of 30 units/kg of body weight. The amount of LPL protein mass was determined using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (25Ikeda Y. Takagi A. Ohkaru Y. Nogi K. Iwanaga T. Kurooka S. Yamamoto A. J. Lipid Res. 1990; 31: 1911-1924Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The enzymatic activity of LPL was determined using a 14C-labeled triolein emulsion substrate as described (14Fan J. Unoki H. Kojima N. Sun H. Shimoyamada H. Deng H. Okazaki M. Shikama H. Yamada N. Watanabe T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 40071-40079Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Plasma Lipid and Lipoprotein Analysis—The plasma lipid and lipoprotein profiles of Tg WHHL rabbits were compared with those of age- and sex-matched littermates. Blood was collected from rabbits after 16 h of food deprivation. Plasma total cholesterol (TC), TG, HDL-C, and FFA were determined using Wako assay kits (26Fan J. Shimoyamada H. Sun H. Honda K. Marcovina S. Watanabe T. Arterioscl. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2001; 21: 88-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Analysis of Glucose Metabolism and Insulin Sensitivity—To evaluate the effect of LPL on glucose metabolism, rabbits were subjected to fasting overnight and then, the intravenous glucose tolerance test (IVGTT) and intravenous insulin tolerance test (IVITT) were performed using the method developed by Zhang et al. (27Zhang B. Fan P. Tanaka H. Saku K. Br. J. Biomed. Sci. 2001; 58: 217-225PubMed Google Scholar). For IVGTT experiments, rabbits were intravenously injected with glucose solution (0.6 g/kg of body weight), and then blood samples were drawn at 5, 10, 15, 20, 30, 45, 60, 75, and 120 min. The glucose clearance rate, insulin secretion, and FFA levels were measured using glucose and FFA assay kits (Wako) and an insulin enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit (Shibayagi Co., Gunma, Japan). For IVITT experiments, blood was collected at 15, 30, 45, 60, 90, and 120 min after intravenous injection of insulin (Shimizu Pharmaceutical Co., Shizuoka, Japan) (1 unit/kg of body weight). Quantitative Analysis of Adipose Tissue—Rabbits at 11 months of age were sacrificed, and adipose tissues from the subcutaneous (inguinal and interscapular adipose) and visceral areas (abdominal cavity, mesenterium, and retroperitoneal adipose) were collected and their wet weight measured. The data were expressed as total body fat weight (g) and percentage of body weight. In addition, we fixed adipose tissue in 10% neutral-buffered formalin, postfixed it in 1% osmium tetraoxide, and observed it under a scanning electron microscope (SEM) (JEOL, JSM-6320F, Tokyo, Japan). Random areas of each part of the adipose tissues was observed under 200-fold magnification and photographed, and then the diameter of the adipocytes was determined by the method developed by Sugihara et al. (28Sugihara H. Toda S. Yonemitsu N. Mitsumoto T. Nippon Rinsho. 2001; 59: 477-482PubMed Google Scholar). High Fat Diet Experiment—To investigate the role of LPL on the high fat diet (HFD)-induced obesity and concurrent insulin resistance, 6 Tg heterozygous WHHL and 5 non-Tg littermates aged 6 months were fed a diet containing 10% fat (6.7% corn oil and 3.3% lard) for 14 weeks. IVGTT was performed at the start and the end of the experiment. Body weight gain was measured biweekly after HFD feeding. The amount of HFD food consumed by each rabbit per day was monitored from 5 to 13 weeks every 2 weeks. Rabbits were sacrificed at 14 weeks of HFD, and adipose tissues were collected and measured as described above. For the evaluation of adipocyte size, the adipose tissues were fixed in 10% neutral-buffered formalin and observed by SEM as described above. Estrogen Studies—To elucidate the possible mechanism giving rise to the gender-related phenotypes observed in Tg WHHL rabbits (see “Results”), the effect of sex hormones on plasma lipids and LPL activity was investigated in both male and female LPL Tg rabbits. For the experiment using male rabbits, 3 male LPL Tg wild-type rabbits and 3 age-matched non-Tg littermates at 6 months of age were injected intramuscularly with 17α-ethinyl estradiol (Sigma) at a dose of 100 μg/kg/day for 10 days (29Ma P.T. Yamamoto T. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 792-796Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). After 0, 5, and 10 days of estrogen treatment, pre-heparin plasma was collected for plasma lipid analysis. Post-heparin plasma for determination of LPL activity was collected 10 min after a bolus injection of heparin at a dose of 30 units/kg of body weight at 0 and 10 days of estrogen treatment. For the experiment with female rabbits, 3 Tg wild-type rabbits and 3 heterozygous Tg WHHL rabbits along with their age-matched non-Tg littermates underwent a bilateral ovariectomy at 6 months (30Haarbo J. Leth-Espensen P. Stender S. Christiansen C. J. Clin. Invest. 1991; 87: 1274-1279Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). LPL activity and the mass of post-heparin plasma were determined at 0 and 10 days after surgery. Statistical Analysis—All values were expressed as mean ± S.E., and statistical significance was determined using Student's t test, Welch's t test, or Mann-Whitney's U test for nonparametric analysis. In all cases, statistical significance was set at p < 0.05. Successful cross-breeding between hLPL Tg rabbits and WHHL rabbits was confirmed by the PCR analysis shown in Fig. 1A. Northern blot analysis revealed that high levels of hLPL expression were detected in muscles and adipose tissues of Tg WHHL rabbits, whereas rabbit endogenous LPL was mainly found in adipose tissues of both Tg and non-Tg WHHL rabbits (Fig. 1B). Overexpression of hLPL transgene in Tg WHHL rabbits resulted in a 3-fold (male) and 2-fold (female) increase of post-heparin plasma LPL activity compared with that in non-Tg WHHL rabbits (Table I). LPL activity in pre-heparin plasma of Tg WHHL rabbits was also increased (Table I), which is possibly caused by the presence of small amounts of unbound hLPL protein in the circulation.Table ILPL protein contents and enzymatic activity in pre- and post-heparin plasma of Tg and non-Tg WHHL rabbitshLPL massLPL activityng/mlnmol/ml/minMalePre-heparinNon-Tg WHHL (n = 5)NAaNA, not applicable.5 ± 1Tg WHHL (n = 5)968 ± 16827 ± 6*Post-heparinNon-Tg WHHL (n = 5)NA173 ± 23Tg WHHL (n = 5)3409 ± 480542 ± 44**FemalePre-heparinNon-Tg WHHL (n = 8)NA8 ± 1Tg WHHL (n = 6)489 ± 13427 ± 5*Post-heparinNon-Tg WHHL (n = 7)NA248 ± 19Tg WHHL (n = 6)1721 ± 283458 ± 15**a NA, not applicable. Open table in a new tab Effect of Increased LPL Expression on Plasma Lipids and Lipoprotein Composition—As summarized Table II, male Tg WHHL rabbits showed a marked reduction of plasma lipids (58 and 86% reductions of plasma TC and TG compared with those of non-Tg WHHL littermates at 9 months of age, respectively). Their TG levels were close to the mean TG levels of normal Japanese white rabbits in our facility. In female Tg WHHL rabbits, plasma TG levels were decreased by 56%; however, the TC levels remained unchanged compared with those in non-Tg WHHL rabbits (Table II). HDL-C levels were slightly elevated in both male and female Tg WHHL rabbits. FFA contents were lower in Tg WHHL rabbits than non-Tg WHHL rabbits, but fasting glucose and insulin levels were not changed.Table IIPlasma lipids, glucose, and insulin in Tg and non-Tg WHHL rabbitsTCTGHDL-CFFAGlucoseInsulinmg/dlmg/dlmg/dlmEq/litermg/dlpg/mlMaleNon-Tg WHHL (n = 11)544 ± 52175 ± 167.7 ± 1.31.26 ± 0.18115 ± 1427 ± 66Tg WHHL (n = 5)227 ± 29**24 ± 2**12.2 ± 2.70.79 ± 0.12118 ± 4457 ± 13FemaleNon-Tg WHHL (n = 14)470 ± 35178 ± 168.5 ± 2.01.00 ± 0.09119 ± 2425 ± 58Tg WHHL (n = 6)591 ± 6378 ± 5**13.8 ± 3.80.88 ± 0.13116 ± 4388 ± 20 Open table in a new tab Plasma lipoproteins from male Tg WHHL and non-Tg WHHL rabbits were separated by sequential density gradient ultracentrifugation and analyzed as previously described (14Fan J. Unoki H. Kojima N. Sun H. Shimoyamada H. Deng H. Okazaki M. Shikama H. Yamada N. Watanabe T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 40071-40079Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The major changes in the lipoprotein profiles of Tg WHHL rabbits included remarkably low levels of VLDL (d < 1.006 g/ml) and intermediate density lipoproteins (IDL) (d = 1.006–1.02 g/ml) associated with a relative increase of the LDL cholesterol level (data not shown). Effect of Increased LPL Activity on Insulin Resistance—To investigate the effect of LPL on insulin sensitivity, 9-month-old rabbits were subjected to fasting overnight and intravenously injected with glucose for IVGTT. As shown in Fig. 2, there was no significant difference between male and female Tg WHHL rabbits in terms of the clearance rate of glucose and secretion of insulin compared with their non-Tg WHHL rabbits. The clearance rate of FFA was, however, enhanced in both sexes of Tg WHHL rabbits as their FFA levels were constantly and significantly lower than those of non-Tg WHHL rabbits (Fig. 2, A and B). In addition, we analyzed the insulin resistance (IR) index using a modified method developed by Mukherjee et al. (31Mukherjee R. Davies P.J. Crombie D.L. Bischoff E.D. Cesario R.M. Jow L. Hamann L.G. Boehm M.F. Mondon C.E. Nadzan A.M. Paterniti Jr., J.R. Heyman R.A. Nature. 1997; 386: 407-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (576) Google Scholar), which reflects the amount of glucose and insulin levels under the conditions of the glucose tolerance test. We found that there was no difference between Tg and non-Tg WHHL rabbits (Fig. 2, A and B). Furthermore, we performed IVITT to examine the direct response to insulin in LPL Tg WHHL rabbits. However, we did not find any differences between the two groups (Fig. 2C). Taken together, these results indicate that systemic overexpression of LPL activity did not alter insulin sensitivity in Tg WHHL rabbits fed a chow diet. Increased LPL Activity Reduced the Fat Tissue—At 11 months of age, all rabbits were sacrificed for analyses of body adipose tissues. For determination of body fat, subcutaneous and visceral fat were carefully collected and weighed while wet. As shown in Fig. 3A, male Tg WHHL rabbits had a significantly lower amount of subcutaneous and visceral adipose tissues than non-Tg WHHL littermates, whereas body weights were similar. Total amounts of adipose tissue in male Tg WHHL rabbits were reduced by 61% compared with those in non-Tg WHHL rabbits. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) examination of male Tg WHHL rabbits aged 6 weeks also revealed that these rabbits had less visceral adipose tissue than non-Tg littermates (Fig. 3C). In female Tg WHHL rabbits, overexpression of LPL led to a slight reduction of body adipose (12% less than control) but it did not reach the level of statistical significance (Fig. 3B). To determine the changes in adipocytes of male Tg rabbits, we examined cellular morphology using SEM and determined cellular size and distribution. As shown in Fig. 4 (A and B), both subcutaneous and visceral adipocytes of Tg WHHL rabbits were predominantly composed of small-sized adipocytes and their average diameter was much smaller than that in non-Tg WHHL rabbits: 101.4 ± 2.7 non-Tg versus 81.5 ± 2.1 Tg (p < 0.01), in subcutaneous adipose and 82.1 ± 1.9 non-Tg versus 70.4 ± 1.1 μm Tg (p < 0.01); in visceral adipose tissue, respectively. These data indicate that the reduction of adipose tissue in Tg WHHL rabbits was associated with both reduction of the total number of adipocytes and of the cellular size. To explore the possible mechanism of the reduced adipose accumulation in Tg WHHL rabbits, we examined the expression of PPAR-γ2, a transcription factor for lipogenesis; PPAR-δ, a transcription factor for lipolysis (β-oxidation of FFA); and HSL, an enzyme for hydrolysis of TG in adipose tissue using Northern blots. As shown in Fig. 5, the expression of these genes was not altered in the adipose tissue of Tg WHHL rabbits, suggesting that these factors are not responsible for the leanness seen in Tg WHHL rabbits.Fig. 4Scanning electron microscopic observation of adipocytes (A) and cellular distribution (B). Subcutaneous and visceral adipose tissues from male Tg and non-Tg littermates were observed using SEM, and representative micrographs are shown (A). The size of at least 100 cells from each sample was calculated, and the cellular size distribution was determined using a Macscope image analysis system (B) (scale bar, 100 μm).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Fig. 5Northern blot analysis of lipogenesisand lipolysis-associated gene expression in adipose tissues of male Tg WHHL rabbits on a chow diet.

As shown in Fig. 6A, Tg WHHL rabbits had a similar BW to non-Tg WHHL rabbits on a chow diet, but constantly gained less BW than did non-Tg WHHL rabbits fed HFD. We excluded the possibility that the lower BW gain in Tg WHHL rabbits was caused by less food consumption. The total daily amounts of HFD consumed by Tg WHHL rabbits were basically"

Tmod1-(1–344), lacking the C-terminal 15 residues, did not nucleate polymerization but blocked the pointed end with all three tropomyosin isoforms as does a shorter fragment, Tmod1-(1–92), lacking the C-terminal “capping” domain though higher concentrations were required. An even shorter fragment, Tmod1-(1–48), bound tropomyosin but did not influence actin filament elongation. Tropomyosin-Tmod may function to locally regulate cytoskeletal dynamics in cells by stabilizing actin filaments. Actin filaments participate in many biological functions, including muscle contraction, cell migration, cell division, and organelle transport. A dynamic actin cytoskeleton allows the cell to respond rapidly to intracellular and extracellular signals by interacting with proteins that spatially and temporally influence the nucleation and kinetics of actin polymerization as well as the stability and state of assembly of the actin filament (1Pollard T.D. Borisy G.G. Cell. 2003; 112: 453-465Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3269) Google Scholar, 2Pollard T.D. J. Cell Biochem. 1986; 31: 87-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Research in recent years has given insight into the mechanisms of assembly and disassembly of actin filaments and their regulation by cell signaling pathways. Now attention is turning to mechanisms that stabilize actin filaments within cells for participation in myosin-dependent contraction and structural functions. Actin filaments are polar with “barbed” and “pointed” ends. The polarity, originally described by the arrowhead appearance of negatively stained filaments when myosin binds (3Huxley H.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1963; 7: 281-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (1022) Google Scholar), is also evidenced by differences in critical concentration and affinity for specific binding proteins (4Pollard T.D. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 103: 2747-2754Crossref PubMed Scopus (596) Google Scholar, 5dos Remedios C.G. Chhabra D. Kekic M. Dedova I.V. Tsubakihara M. Berry D.A. Nosworthy N.J. Physiol. Rev. 2003; 83: 433-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (763) Google Scholar). In cells, rapid growth of actin filaments occurs by addition of actin monomer at free barbed ends, which in turn may be stabilized by the rapid binding of a capping protein. The fate of a filament then depends on the dynamics of the pointed end and the lability of the filament to severing proteins. The focus of the present work is to learn how two proteins, tropomyosin and tropomodulin, regulate the dynamics of the pointed ends of actin filaments. Tropomyosins are a family of coiled coil proteins that bind head-to-tail along the sides of the helical actin filament (6Perry S.V. J. Muscle Res. Cell Motil. 2001; 22: 5-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar). Best known for its function in cooperative regulation of actinmyosin interaction (7Geeves M.A. Lehrer S.S. Results Probl.

Tropomyosin isoforms differ in actin affinity and regulatory function and exhibit developmentally regulated and tissue-specific expression patterns (6Perry S.V. J. Muscle Res. Cell Motil. 2001; 22: 5-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar) as well as different localizations within cells (21Percival J.M. Thomas G. Cock T.A. Gardiner E.M. Jeffrey P.L. Lin J.J.

The two major classes of tropomyosin, short (∼247 amino acids) and long (∼284 amino acids), differ in sequence and structure at the N terminus (22Lin J.J. Warren K.S. Wamboldt D.D. Wang T. Lin J.L.

Chem. 1987; 262: 12792-12800Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), is a family of widely expressed proteins that bind to tropomyosin and actin, capping the pointed end of actin filaments (26Fowler V.M. Soc. Gen. Physiol. Ser. 1997; 52: 79-89PubMed Google Scholar). Erythrocyte tropomodulin (Tmod1) 1The abbreviations used are: TmodtropomodulinTMtropomyosinstTMstriated muscle α-TM.1The abbreviations used are: TmodtropomodulinTMtropomyosinstTMstriated muscle α-TM. binds weakly to actin alone (Kd ∼0.3–0.4 mm) but much stronger in the presence of tropomyosin (Kd ∼50 pm) (27Weber A. Pennise C.R. Fowler V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34637-34645Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Analysis of tropomodulin fragments and antibodies to specific domains has identified the actin and tropomyosin binding domains to be the C- and N-terminal parts of the molecule, respectively (28Babcock G.G.

Nature. 1995; 377: 83-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). The atomic structure of the C-terminal domain is a right-handed super-helix composed of alternating α-helices and β-strands (30Krieger I. Kostyukova A. Yamashita A. Nitanai Y. Maeda Y. Biophys.

Mutations in the homologous region of a short tropomyosin also resulted in the loss of tropomodulin binding (34Vera C. Sood A. Gao K.M. Yee L.J. Lin J.J. Sung L.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2000; 378: 16-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Here we have investigated regulation of the dynamics of the pointed end of the actin filament by different tropomyosin isoforms alone and in concert with Tmod1 and its fragments. Constructions of Expression Vectors of Tropomodulin N-terminal Fragments—The expression plasmids for the N-terminal fragments of chicken E-tropomodulin (Tmod1), named pET(His)Tmod1-(1–92) and pET(His)Tmod1-(1–48), were constructed using a QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The plasmids were amplified by PCR using PfuTurbo DNA polymerase with the tropomodulin expression plasmid pET(His)Tmod(N39) (38Kostyukova A. Yamauchi E. Maeda K. Krieger I. Maeda Y. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 6470-6475Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) as the template using two complementary sets of oligonucleotides. For Tmod1-(1–92) the oligonucleotides were 5′-GCCTTTCACTGGTGAAAAGTGATGACGTCCTTGGATCCCCAAGCAGAAGCC-3′, and 5′-GGCTTCTGCTTGGGGATCCAAGGACGTCATCACTTTTCAC-CAGTGAAAGGC-3′. For Tmod1-(1–48) the oligonucleotides were 5′-GCCAGCAGGGCTCTGATAGAGACGTCAGACGCAAAAGC-3′ and 5′-GCTTTTGCGTCTGACGTCTCTATCAGAGCCCTGCTGGC-3′. The oligonucleotides contained two stop codons (in bold) and an AatII site (underlined). The original plasmid was digested using DpnI, and the mixture was used to transform Escherichia coli (DH5α). After plasmid purification, the presence of the mutations was confirmed by restriction enzyme mapping and sequencing of the full tropomodulin fragment. Synthesis of all oligonucleotides and sequence determination were done at the UMDNJ DNA Synthesis and Sequencing Facility (Robert Wood Johnson Medical School, Piscataway, NJ). Sequence analysis of pET(His)Tmod1-(1–92) showed there was just one stop codon, not two as designed. Instead of the first stop codon TGA (as in the oligonucleotide), the sequence was CGA. This did not change the amino acid sequence from the original tropomodulin (Arg in both cases) but made the fragment length 92 (instead of 91) amino acids plus a His tag and Met at the N terminus. Protein Expression and Purification—Tropomodulin and its fragments, Tmod1-(1–344), lacking the last 15 amino acids (previously named Tmod(N39)), Tmod1-(1–92), and Tmod1-(1–48) were overexpressed in E. coli strain BL21(DE3)pLysE and purified according to the method described for tropomodulin and Tmod1-(1–344) (38Kostyukova A. Yamauchi E. Maeda K. Krieger I. Maeda Y. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 6470-6475Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The N-terminal fragments Tmod1-(1–92) and Tmod1-(1–48) were further purified by reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography using a Vydac C18 column (Hesperia, CA). The fragments eluted at ∼42% acetonitrile and were lyophilized. The molecular masses of these fragments, determined by electrospray mass spectroscopy (Keck Biotechnology Resource Laboratory, Yale University, New Haven, CT), were 11,804.0 and 6,573 Da found versus 11,804.2 and 6,573.3 expected. Chicken pectoral muscle skeletal actin was purified from acetone powder as described (39Spudich J.A. Watt S. J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 4866-4871Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). G-actin was purified on a Sephacryl S-300 column (40MacLean-Fletcher S. Pollard T.D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1980; 96: 18-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar) and was stored in liquid nitrogen. Actin was labeled with pyrenyl-iodoacetamide, and the labeling ratios were calculated according to Refs. 41Kouyama T. Mihashi K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1981; 114: 33-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (719) Google Scholar and 42Cooper J.A. Walker S.B. Pollard T.D. J. Muscle Res. Cell Motil. 1983; 4: 253-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar. The degree of the labeling was 80–99%. Before experiments, G-actin (labeled or unlabeled) was defrosted in a 37 °C-water bath and then centrifuged at 100,000 rpm (TLA-100, Beckman) for 30 min at 4 °C. N-acetylated striated muscle α-tropomyosin, stTM was purified from chicken pectoral muscle according to Ref. 43Hitchcock-DeGregori S.E. Lewis S.F. Chou T.M. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 3305-3314Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, and rat recombinant α-tropomyosins TM2 and TM5a were expressed in E. coli and purified as previously described (37Moraczewska J. Nicholson-Flynn K. Hitchcock-DeGregori S.E. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 15885-15892Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). AcTM1bZip is a designed chimeric protein that contains 19 residues of short rat α-tropomyosin encoded by exon 1b and the 18 C-terminal residues of the GCN4 leucine zipper domain (24Greenfield N.J. Huang Y.J. Palm T. Swapna G.V. Monleon D. Montelione G.T. Hitchcock-DeGregori S.E. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 312: 833-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). It was synthesized by SynPep (Dublin, CA). Protein purity was evaluated using SDS-PAGE (44Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207012) Google Scholar). Native gel electrophoresis was done in 9% polyacrylamide gels that were polymerized in the presence of 10% glycerol without SDS. The actin concentrations were calculated from the UV spectrum using an extinction coefficient of 11.0 (1% at 280 nm). Concentrations of other proteins were determined by measuring their difference spectra in 6 m guanidine-HCl between pH 12.5 and 6.0 (45Edelhoch H. Biochemistry. 1967; 6: 1948-1954Crossref PubMed Scopus (3003) Google Scholar) using for calculations the extinction coefficients of 2357 for tyrosine and 830 for tryptophan (46Fasman G.D. Practical Handbook of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1989: 84Google Scholar). Recombinant human gelsolin was a generous gift from Dr. Philip G. Allen. Fluorescence Measurements—The rates of actin polymerization and depolymerization were measured using the change in pyrene-actin fluorescence (41Kouyama T. Mihashi K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1981; 114: 33-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (719) Google Scholar) using a PTI fluorimeter (Lawrenceville, NJ) (excitation, 366 nm, and emission, 387 nm, with a 2-nm slit). To measure polymerization of actin at the pointed end, short filaments capped at the barbed ends with gelsolin were prepared by polymerization of 6 μm G-actin in the presence of 28 nm gelsolin. The G-actin cation used for polymerization was changed from Ca2+ to Mg2+ by incubation with 50 μm MgCl2 and 0.2 mm EGTA for 10 min before the experiment. Polymerization was monitored by the increase in fluorescence when the filaments were diluted 5-fold with G-actin (10% pyrenylactin) in F-buffer (100 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.2 mm ATP, 0.2 mm CaCl2, 1 mm NaN3, 10 mm imidazole, pH 7.0) containing tropomyosin and/or tropomodulin fragments. The final concentrations of F- and G-actin were 1.2 and 1.5 μm, respectively. For depolymerization experiments, gelsolin-capped filaments were prepared by polymerization of 3 μm G-actin (10% pyrenylactin) in the presence of 11.2 nm gelsolin. Depolymerization was monitored by the decreasing fluorescence of filaments diluted 5-fold into F-buffer. Tropomyosin and/or tropomodulin were added 15 min before dilution. Gelsolin-capped filaments were prepared in sets of four, and fluorescence measurements were carried out in parallel in a 4-cuvette holder with actin as a control in each set. Exponential curves were fit to the polymerization or depolymerization data using SigmaPlot, and initial rates were calculated as the first derivatives at time 0. The S.D. for the initial rates calculated for actin polymerization at the pointed end with seeds prepared separately was 15–20% of the value of average initial rate, whereas it was just 1–2% in experiments when the seeds were from the same set. S.D. of the final fluorescence in both cases were 6 and 4%, respectively. Therefore the large error in initial rate determination depends on errors in gelsolin concentration (concentration of pointed ends), not the actin concentration. Sedimentation Experiments—Binding of tropomyosin to actin was measured by cosedimentation according to Refs. 47Hammell R.L. Hitchcock-DeGregori S.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4236-4242Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar and 48Heald R.W. Hitchcock-DeGregori S.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 5254-5259Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, with modifications. Actin filaments polymerized in the presence of tropomyosin and/or tropomodulin were pelleted at 60,000 rpm, 20 min at 20 °C, and twice washed with F-buffer. The pellet and supernatant compositions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE, Coomassie blue (R250) stained gels were scanned using an Amersham Biosciences model 300A computing densitometer (Sunnyvale, CA), and the tropomyosin:actin ratio was calculated for each sample. Circular Dichroism Measurements—CD measurements were done using an Aviv model 62 spectropolarimeter (Lakewood, NJ) as previously described (23Greenfield N.J. Montelione G.T. Farid R.S. Hitchcock-DeGregori S.E. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 7834-7843Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 36Greenfield N.J. Hitchcock-DeGregori S.E. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 16797-16805Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The protein concentrations were 10 μm AcTM1bZip, 10 μm Tmod1-(1–92), and 10 μm Tmod1-(1–48) in 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 6.5. Binding constants were calculated according to Ref. 32Greenfield N.J. Fowler V.M. Biophys. J. 2002; 82: 2580-2591Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar. The CD measurements also were performed for Tmod1-(1–92) at pH 7.2, and the calculated binding constant was within the experimental error of the value obtained at pH 6.5. Our aims were 1) to determine the structural requirements and isoform specificity of the regulation by tropomyosin of actin polymerization and depolymerization from the pointed end of the actin filament, 2) to understand whether the structural requirements for tropomodulin binding to tropomyosin model peptides are the same as for blocking the pointed end of filaments, and 3) to define the tropomodulin subdomains required for regulation of pointed end polymerization and depolymerization with tropomyosin. We studied tropomyosins with three different N-terminal structures: recombinant TM5a, a short α-tropomyosin where the N terminus is encoded by exon 1b, and recombinant TM2 and striated muscle stTM, long α-tropomyosins where the N terminus is encoded by exon 1a. TM2 is unacetylated because it is expressed in E. coli, whereas stTM, isolated from chicken muscle, is N-acetylated. The C termini of TM2 and TM5a are identical (encoded by exon 9d) but different from stTM (encoded by exon 9a). Actin Polymerization in the Presence of Different Tropomyosin Isoforms—Actin filament dynamics at the pointed end were investigated in short actin filaments capped at the barbed end with gelsolin. Tropomyosin binding to gelsolin-capped actin filaments has been reported to remove gelsolin from the barbed end and then anneal filaments (49Ishikawa R. Yamashiro S. Matsumura F. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 16764-16770Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 50Nyakern-Meazza M. Narayan K. Schutt C.E. Lindberg U. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 28774-28779Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Care was taken to minimize these processes that are proportional to the actin and tropomyosin concentrations and inversely proportional to filament length (50Nyakern-Meazza M. Narayan K. Schutt C.E. Lindberg U. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 28774-28779Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 51Andrianantoandro E. Blanchoin L. Sept D. McCammon J.A. Pollard T.D. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 312: 721-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The gelsolin-actin seeds were prepared in the absence of tropomyosin at 1:210 and 1:270 gelsolin:actin molar ratios for polymerization and depolymerization, respectively, long enough for cooperative tropomyosin binding (the length of 15–22 tropomyosin molecules) and to reduce the rate of annealing. The actin and tropomyosin concentrations were lower than those in published reports to further minimize rapid annealing. Tropomyosin and tropomodulin were mixed with G-actin, 20× F-buffer was added, and this mixture was immediately added to seeds polymerized in cuvettes. The rates of polymerization reported are calculated initial rates. Because the rate of annealing of actin filaments increases with tropomyosin concentration (50Nyakern-Meazza M. Narayan K. Schutt C.E. Lindberg U. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 28774-28779Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), we determined the minimum concentration of each tropomyosin isoform sufficient for saturation of gelsolin-capped actin filaments. Following polymerization (after one hour) in the presence of different concentrations of tropomyosin, 0.2–3 μm, the actin (2.7 μm) was sedimented and the bound tropomyosin was analyzed using SDS-PAGE. The pellets contained gelsolin, suggesting that detectable amounts remained bound to the filaments and that the filaments did not anneal (data not shown). In further polymerization experiments the concentrations of TM5a, stTM, and TM2 were 0.5, 1, and 2 μm, respectively, concentrations where the F-actin was saturated with tropomyosin. No gelsolin was added with the pyrene-G-actin so as to maintain a constant number of pointed ends and to reduce spontaneous nucleation of actin filaments in the course of the experiment. Fig. 1 compares the rates of pointed end elongation in the presence of three tropomyosin isoforms. The gelsolin-actin seeds contained unlabeled actin, and the polymerization rate was measured using the increase in fluorescence during polymerization of pyrene-actin. In the absence of tropomodulin, tropomyosins had little effect on the initial rate of polymerization. Addition of TM5a, stTM, and TM2 in excess of saturation (1.5, 2, and 3 μm, respectively) to polymerized pyrenylactin did not change the final fluorescence, suggesting they had no large effect on the overall critical concentration of F-actin, consistent with previous results (52Hitchcock-DeGregori S.E. Sampath P. Pollard T.D. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 9182-9185Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), and that the binding of tropomyosin did not enhance or quench the pyrene fluorescence. The small effect on the rate of pointed end elongation by the tropomyosins is inconsistent with annealing. Tropomodulin Capping Activity Depends on the Tropomyosin N-terminal Sequence and Structure—Full-length Tmod1 has a small nucleating effect on actin polymerization (53Fowler V.M. Greenfield N.J. Moyer J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 14: 14Google Scholar), (Fig. 2). To simplify the interpretation of our assays, we used a truncated form of Tmod1 that lacks the C-terminal 15 amino acids, Tmod1-(1–344) (38Kostyukova A. Yamauchi E. Maeda K. Krieger I. Maeda Y. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 6470-6475Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) and does not nucleate actin polymerization (Fig. 2). Tmod1-(1–344) alone slightly inhibited the rate of elongation (Fig. 1D). The results suggest that the proposed second actin binding site (53Fowler V.M. Greenfield N.J. Moyer J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 14: 14Google Scholar) is located at the extreme C terminus of Tmod1. All Tmod1 forms in this study had a six-residue His tag at the N terminus. The His tag does not influence the rate of polymerization of G-actin because addition of an equimolar concentration of a six-residue His tag cleaved from a recombinant protein had no effect on the rate or final level of polymerization of 1 μm pyrene actin (results not shown). In the presence of tropomyosin, Tmod1–(1-344) had the same capping activity as full-length tropomodulin (results not shown). Tmod1-(1–344) inhibited the rate of pointed end elongation with all three tropomyosin isoforms (Fig. 1), but the effectiveness depended on the structure of the N terminus (Fig. 1D). TM5a and stTM are much more effective than TM2, nearly completely inhibiting polymerization at 20 nm Tmod1-(1–344). The difference in elongation rates with TM5a and stTM is consistent with the higher affinity of Tmod1 for short non-muscle tropomyosin than for long isoforms in full-length tropomyosins, as well as in model peptides (32Greenfield N.J.

Biochem. 1992; 205: 355-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). However, whereas recombinant TM2, with an unacetylated N terminus, had no detectable affinity for either Tmod1 or Tmod4 (32Greenfield N.J. Fowler V.M. Biophys. J. 2002; 82: 2580-2591Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), when bound to actin with Tmod1-(1–344) TM2 inhibited elongation though higher tropomodulin concentrations were required. N-acetylation of long α-tropomyosins increases the stability of the N-terminal domain (36Greenfield N.J. Hitchcock-DeGregori S.E. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 16797-16805Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) and is required for the extreme N terminus to assume a coiled coil structure in model peptides (23Greenfield N.J.

Hitchcock-DeGregori S.E. Cohen C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 8496-8501Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). Our present results suggest that the binding of recombinant TM2 to the actin filament with Tmod1 partially overcomes the lack of N-acetylation and may induce coiled coil formation of the N terminus, allowing it to bind to Tmod1. The relatively normal regulatory function of unacetylated stTM when it binds to F-actin in the presence of troponin is another example of the same phenomenon (48Heald R.W. Hitchcock-DeGregori S.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 5254-5259Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The sequence of the tropomyosin C terminus appears not to influence pointed end dynamics in the presence or absence of Tmod1. TM5a and TM2 have the same C terminus and are identical except for the first 43 amino acids, yet they differ in function. Effect of Short N-terminal Tropomodulin Fragments Tmod1-(1–92) and Tmod1-(1–48) on Tropomyosin Binding and Actin Polymerization—Analysis of Tmod1 fragments has identified two pointed end capping domains: a C-terminal capping domain (residues 160–359) that is independent of tropomyosin and a N-terminal capping domain (residues 1–130) that depends on and binds to the N terminus of tropomyosin (32Greenfield N.J.

The tropomyosin binding domain has been further localized to residues 1–92 (38Kostyukova A. Yamauchi E. Maeda K. Krieger I. Maeda Y. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 6470-6475Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) and in the present work to residues 1–48 (Figs. 3 and 4). Tmod1-(1–92) also reduced the rate of pointed end elongation in the presence of all tropomyosins, though higher concentrations were required than with Tmod1-(1–344). Nearly full inhibition was obtained only with TM5a (Fig. 1). The results show that at least part of the N-terminal capping domain resides in Tmod1-(1–92).Fig. 4Complex formation between tropomodulin N-terminal fragments Tmod1-(1–92) and Tmod1-(1–48) and tropomyosin N-terminal chimeric peptide AcTM1bZip monitored by non-denaturing gel electrophoresis.Lane 1, Tmod1-(1–48); lane 2, Tmod1-(1–48) and AcTM1bZip; lane 3, Tmod1-(1–92); lane 4, Tmod1-(1–92) and AcTM1bZip.

J. 2002; 82: 2580-2591Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). A plasmid was constructed to express a fragment with the N-terminal α-helix, Tmod1-(1–48). Analysis of binding using circular dichroism spectroscopy showed that both Tmod1-(1–92) (Fig. 3A) and Tmod1-(1–48) (Fig. 3B) formed complexes with AcTM1bZip, a model peptide with the same N-terminal sequence as TM5a, used in previous studies (32Greenfield N.J. Fowler V.M. Biophys. J. 2002; 82: 2580-2591Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The ellipticity and stability of the mixtures were increased relative to that of fragments. The binding constants estimated from the changes in ellipticity were 0.22 ± 0.10 μm and 0.14 ± 0.11 for the binding of Tmod1-(1–92) and Tmod1-(1–48), respectively, also similar to that reported for Tmod1-(1–130) (0.23 ± 0.15) in Ref. 32Greenfield N.J. Fowler V.M. Biophys. J. 2002; 82: 2580-2591Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar. Binding to AcTM1bZip was directly analyzed using native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (Fig. 4). Additional bands corresponding to complexes between each tropomodulin fragment and AcTM1bZip appeared when they were combined. The tropomyosin binding domain of Tmod1 is therefore localized to residues 1–48. The capping activity, however, is not present because Tmod1-(1–48) had no effect on filament elongation in the presence of TM5a even at a concentration four times higher than that used for Tmod1-(1–92) (results not shown). Influence of Tropomyosin Isoforms and Tropomodulin Fragments on Actin Depolymerization—Tropomodulin blocks the pointed end of actin filaments by inhibiting depolymerization as well as polymerization. To measure depolymerization, pyrene-labeled actin filaments with gelsolin at the barbed end were diluted to the critical concentration of the pointed end (4Pollard T.D. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 103: 2747-2754Crossref PubMed Scopus (596) Google Scholar), and the rate of loss of fluorescence was measured. In the absence of Tmod1-(1–344), saturating amounts of TM5a inhibited the rate of pointed end depolymerization by 50%. StTM and TM2 were much less effective (Fig. 5D), consistent with previous work (19Broschat K.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 21323-21329Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, when gelsolin-blocked actin filaments were preincubated with saturating amounts of tropomyosin and then diluted to 0.6 μm actin without added tropomyosin, resulting in subsaturating concentrations, the inhibition was similar (Fig. 5, A–C). In the experiments in Fig. 5, the actin filaments were incubated with saturating concentrations of tropomyosin for 15 min before dilution to ensure proper head-to-tail alignment on the filament. We were concerned that inhibition of the rate of depolymerization by TM5a may reflect annealing, resulting in a reduced concentration of ends and hence a slower rate. When gelsolin-actin filaments were incubated with TM5a for 15 or 60 min prior to dilution, the initial rate of depolymerization was about 52 ± 14 and 57 ± 12% of the control (no TM5a), compared with 70 ± 9% of the control when added immediately prior to dilution (Fig. 6). The time of incubation with TM5a before dilution did not change the number of ends because the fluorescence after three hours was similar. The small difference in the initial rate could reflect a small amount of annealing or, more likely, the time it takes for tropomyosin to align properly with respect to the ends. In the presence of Tmod1-(1–344), all three tropomyosin isoforms blocked depolymerization, though TM2 was least effective (Fig. 5D). Tmod1-(1–344) alone had almost no effect on the rate of depolymerization. Tmod1-(1–92) also inhibited the rate of depolymerization with tropomyosin, though the effect was much less than on polymerization. The part of Tmod1-(1–92) with capping activity (versus the tropomyosin binding site) may physically inhibit monomer addition at the pointed end even though it is too short to prevent depolymerization. Another possibility is that the C-terminal part of Tmod1-(1–92) binds actin, causing conformational changes in the actin molecule that prevent monomer addition without influencing depolymerization. The complete blocking of depolymerization by subsaturating concentrations of tropomyosin in the presence of Tmod1 surprised us. Because troponin (48Heald R.W. Hitchcock-DeGregori S.E. J. Biol.

Neither full-length Tmod1 nor Tmod1-(1–344) increased or decreased tropomyosin binding to actin. We suggest that a Tmod1-tropomyosin complex selectively binds with high affinity at the pointed end without influencing cooperative binding along the length of the filament. We have defined the regions of Tmod1 and the N-terminal structural requirements of tropomyosin needed for capping of the pointed end of actin filaments blocked at the barbed end with gelsolin. In Tmod1, a 359-residue protein, only residues 1–48 are needed for high affinity tropomyosin binding. The first 92 residues are sufficient for blocking elongation, but complete capping of depolymerization requires additional regions of the molecule. Removal of the C-terminal 15 amino acids of Tmod1 destroys the nucleating activity of Tmod1 in the absence of tropomyosin and gelsolin, but all tropomyosin-dependent activities are intact."

The diverse roles of the ion are made possible by the complex temporal and spatial patterns of the Ca2+ signal (1Berridge M.J. Lipp P. Bootman M.D. Nat. Rev. Mol.

Physiol. 2001; 91: 1438-1449Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Sarcolemma depolarization opens voltage-gated Ca2+ channels to generate either transient or maintained increases in [Ca2+]c (e.g. Ref. 6Bradley K.N. Flynn E.R.M. Muir T.C. McCarron J.G. J. Physiol. 2002; 538: 465-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), whereas sarcolemma acting agonists, which generate InsP3, evoke complex spatial Ca2+ signaling patterns (7Wier W.G. Morgan K.G. Rev. Physiol. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2003; 150: 91-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). InsP3-sensitive Ca2+ release occurs at discrete sites on the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR). These sites consist of a few tens of receptors, from which periodic local increases in [Ca2+]c, termed Ca2+ “puffs,” are generated. These puffs are the elementary components of the global cellular Ca2+ response to InsP3 (8Parker I. Yao Y. J. Physiol. 1996; 491: 663-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 9Bootman M.D. Berridge M.J. Lipp P. Cell. 1997; 91: 367-373Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). Under certain, as yet unspecified, conditions, Ca2+ puffs interact with one another and coalesce so that the cytoplasm becomes excitable and generates repetitive Ca2+ transients called “oscillations.” These oscillations, in turn, may propagate as traveling spatial Ca2+ gradients (Ca2+ waves), at frequencies related to the agonist concentration, to spread information between and within cells (9Bootman M.D. Berridge M.J.

Ca2+ waves have been widely observed in many cell types, but the mechanisms underlying their propagation remain unclear. Several proposals have been made of which two have been prominent; both involve those receptors on the SR that govern Ca2+ release, i.e. ryanodine receptors (RyR) and InsP3 receptors. The first proposal (14Goldbeter A. Dupont G. Berridge M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 1461-1465Crossref PubMed Scopus (545) Google Scholar, 15Boittin F-X. Macrez N Halet G.

Bonev A.D. Santana L.F. Nelson M.T. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 283: H2169-H2176Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) implicated mainly RyR as the major channel for the generation of the upstroke of Ca2+ waves. Following InsP3-generating agonist activity at the sarcolemma, InsP3 acts as a primer to mediate Ca2+ release at InsP3 receptors. The Ca2+ released then initiates Ca2+ induced Ca2+ release (CICR) at RyR. Thereafter, the wave proceeds independently of InsP3 by CICR acting at RyR. The second proposed mechanism of Ca2+ wave progression relies exclusively on Ca2+-dependent feedback processes at the InsP3 receptor (18Wakui M. Potter B.V.L. Petersen O.H. Nature. 1989; 339: 317-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar, 19Hajnoczky G. Thomas A.P. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3533-3543Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). After a priming release of Ca2+ by InsP3, the InsP3 receptor may also serve as a site for CICR being opened by released Ca2+ in a positive feedback process (9Bootman M.D. Berridge M.J. Lipp P. Cell. 1997; 91: 367-373Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar, 20Meyer T. Holowka D. Stryer L.

EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1674-1680Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). In this proposal the rapid upstroke of the Ca2+ wave (the leading edge) is mediated by Ca2+ acting in a positive feedback manner on InsP3 receptors, with each Ca2+ release event activating the next adjacent InsP3 receptor(s) to maintain progression (9Bootman M.D. Berridge M.J. Lipp P. Cell. 1997; 91: 367-373Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). Following the upstroke, Ca2+ release is reduced, even though the stimulus, InsP3, presumably persists. This reduction, manifested as a decline in [Ca2+]c, accounts for the back of the wave and occurs while the wave front progresses. Why then does release stop? Clues as to how this may occur have been derived from consideration of the structural organization of the SR. In one set of proposals the SR may be compartmentalized, comprising a series of separate but related subunits, its lumen discontinuous (25Oldershaw K.A. Nunn D.L. Taylor C.W. Biochem. J. 1991; 278: 705-708Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 26Takei K. Stukenbrok H. Metcalf A. Mignery G.A. Sudhof T.C. Volpe P. De Camilli P. J.

Each subunit may release its limited measure of Ca2+ and be depleted in sequence, thus accounting for both wave progression and the fall of [Ca2+]c at the back of the wave. Alternatively, the SR may not comprise a series of separate subunits but may exist in luminal continuity, with much greater Ca2+ reserves available to each stimulus. Release may stop because, after releasing Ca2+, the InsP3R or RyR close and become refractory even in the presence of InsP3 and Ca2+. Several mechanisms could contribute to the refractoriness. For example, a lowered SR luminal [Ca2+] or an increased [Ca2+]c could deactivate the receptors, or InsP3 itself could desensitize its own receptors (29Fabiato A. J. Gen. Physiol. 1985; 85: 247-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (685) Google Scholar, 30Parker I. Ivorra I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The diversity of explanations for both the rise in [Ca2+]c at the front of the wave and its decline at the back, makes it difficult to unravel the role of the InsP3 receptors per se, their Ca2+ requirement, and their interaction with RyR in wave generation and hence in signaling pathways. Much of our current understanding of the Ca2+ release process in wave generation has been inferred either indirectly from pharmacological approaches, where poor drug specificity could have led to ambiguous results, or from studies using broken cell systems in which the spatial organization of Ca2+ signals may have been disrupted. The method of localized photolysis of caged compounds that is presently used has enabled rapid and reproducible increases in InsP3 and Ca2+ in subcellular compartments to be made and has permitted a more direct evaluation of the role of InsP3 receptors in Ca2+ wave generation in intact smooth muscle cells. This study has shown that Ca2+ waves progress by sequential release of Ca2+ from the InsP3 receptor triggered by Ca2+ itself and that RyR do not play a significant role in this process. The InsP3-sensitive SR store is not composed of a series of separate subunits but appears to be functionally compartmentalized in that InsP3-mediated release of Ca2+ from one region of the SR renders that region, but only that region, refractory to InsP3. In neighboring regions not previously exposed to InsP3, the phosphoinositide remains effective in releasing Ca2+. The functional compartmentalization arises from localized feedback deactivation of the InsP3 receptor and accounts for the back of the wave. The feedback deactivation occurs from a persistent [Ca2+]c-dependent process on the InsP3 receptors, which makes them refractory and incapable of further Ca2+ release. In contrast to the complexity of the signaling pattern generated by agonists, depolarization produced a uniform increase in Ca2+ throughout the cytoplasm. From male guinea pigs (500-700 g), humanely killed by cervical dislocation followed by immediate exsanguination in accordance with the guidelines of the Animal (Scientific Procedures) Act UK 1986, a segment of intact distal colon (∼5 cm) was transferred to an oxygenated (95% O2, 5% CO2) physiological saline solution of the following composition (mm): NaCl 118.4, NaHCO3 25, KCl 4.7, NaH2PO4 1.13, MgCl2 1.3, CaCl2 2.7, and glucose 11 (pH 7.4). From this tissue, following removal of the mucosa, single smooth muscle cells were enzymatically dissociated (39McCarron J.G. Muir T.C. J. Physiol. 1999; 516: 149-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). All experiments were carried out at room temperature (20 ± 2 °C). Electrophysiology—Membrane currents were measured using conventional tight seal whole-cell recording methods. The extracellular solution contained (mm): sodium glutamate 80, NaCl 40, tetraethylammonium chloride 20, MgCl2 1.1, CaCl2 3, Hepes 10, and glucose 30 (pH 7.4 with NaOH). The pipette solution contained (mm): Cs2SO4 85, CsCl 20, MgCl2 1, Hepes 30, MgATP 3, pyruvic acid 2.5, malic acid 2.5, NaH2PO4 1, creatine phosphate 5, guanosine phosphate 0.5, and caged inositol trisphosphate (InsP3) trisodium salt 0.025. Where spontaneous transient outward currents (STOCs) were measured, the extracellular NaCl concentration was increased to 60 mm, KCl (4.7 mm) added and tetraethylammonium chloride (which blocks K+ currents) omitted, the other constituents remained the same. In the pipette solution, Cs2SO4 and CsCl were replaced by KCl 105 mm. Whole-cell currents were measured using an Axopatch 200B (Axon Instruments, Union City, CA), low-pass filtered at 500 Hz (8-pole Bessel filter; Frequency Devices, Haverhill, MA), digitally sampled at 1.5 kHz using a Digidata interface and pClamp (version 8, Axon Instruments), and stored for analysis. Imaging—Cells were loaded with Fluo-3 AM (10 μm) and wortmannin (10 μm; to prevent contraction) for at least 30 min prior to the beginning of the experiment. Qualitatively identical results were obtained in the absence of wortmannin. Two-dimensional [Ca2+]c images were obtained using a wide-field digital imaging system. Single cells were illuminated at 488 nm (bandpass 14 nm) from a monochromator (Polychrome IV, TILL Photonics, Martinsried, Germany) and imaged through an oil immersion objective (×40 UV 1.3 NA; Nikon UK, Surrey, UK). Excitation light was passed via a fiber optic guide through a 485 bandpass filter (bandpass, 15 nm) and a field stop diaphragm and reflected off of a 505-nm long-pass dichroic mirror. Emitted light was guided through a 535-nm barrier filter (bandpass, 45 nm) to an intensified, cooled, frame transfer CCD camera (Pentamax Gen IV, Roper Scientific, Trenton, NJ) operating in “virtual chip” mode with Win-View32 (Roper Scientific). Full-frame images (150 × 150 pixels) with a pixel size of 563 nm at the cell were acquired at 100 frames/s unless otherwise indicated. The Ca2+ imaging data was recorded on a personal computer. The electrophysiological measurements and imaging data were synchronized by recording, on pClamp, a transistor-transistor logic (TTL) output from the CCD camera, which reported its readout status together with the electrophysiological information. Localized Flash Photolysis—The output of a xenon flash lamp (Rapp Optoelecktronic, Hamburg, Germany), used to uncage InsP3, was passed though a UG-5 filter to select ultraviolet light, and merged into the excitation light path via a fiber optic bundle and long-pass dichroic mirror at the lens part of the epi-illumination attachment of the microscope. The fiber optic diameter together with the lens magnification determined the area (spot size, ∼10 μm) of InsP3 photolysis. Data Analysis—Images were analyzed using the program Metamorph 5.1 (Universal Imaging, Downingtown PA). [Ca2+]c measurements were made at 10- or 20-μm intervals throughout the cell from the fluorescence changes occurring in single lines, 1 pixel wide (563 nm), drawn across the width of the cell. Fluorescence signals were expressed as ratios (F/F0 or ΔF/F0) of fluorescence counts (F) relative to base line (control) values (taken as 1) before stimulation (F0). Original fluorescence recordings were not filtered, smoothed, or averaged. Summarized results are expressed as means ± S.E. of n cells. A paired or unpaired Student's t test was applied to the raw data as appropriate; p < 0.05 was considered significant. Drugs and Chemicals—Drugs were applied by either pressure ejection or addition to the extracellular solution as stated in the text. Concentrations in the text refer to the salts where appropriate. Fluo-3 AM ester and tetramethylrhodamine ethyl ester perchlorate were purchased from Molecular Probes, Inc. (Cambridge Bioscience, Cambridge, UK) and caged Ins(1,4,5)P3-trisodium salt and Fluo-3 pentaammonium salt from Calbiochem-Novabiochem. All other reagents were obtained from Sigma. Depolarization and Carbachol (CCh)-induced [Ca2+]c Changes—Depolarization (-70 to +10 mV) activated membrane currents and increased [Ca2+]c uniformly and simultaneously throughout the cell (Fig. 1). Thus the time course of the rise, the peak amplitude, and the rate of recovery of [Ca2+]c to base-line values after the end of depolarization did not differ significantly in different regions of the cell (n = 6). The depolarization-evoked rise in [Ca2+]c occurred by Ca2+ entry via voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels with no contribution from CICR (6Bradley K.N. Flynn E.R.M. Muir T.C. McCarron J.G. J. Physiol. 2002; 538: 465-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 40McCarron J.G. Flynn E.R. Bradley K.N. Muir T.C. J. Physiol. 2000; 525: 113-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Thus depletion of the SR by the Ca2+ pump inhibitors thapsigargin or cyclopiazonic acid or by rendering the SR “leaky” by ryanodine and caffeine did not reduce the amplitude of the depolarization-evoked Ca2+ transients (6Bradley K.N. Flynn E.R.M. Muir T.C. McCarron J.G. J. Physiol. 2002; 538: 465-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). In contrast to these uniform [Ca2+]c increases, the atropine-sensitive (41McCarron J.G. Craig J.W. Bradley K.N. Muir T.C. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 2207-2218PubMed Google Scholar) changes evoked by the InsP3-generating muscarinic agonist CCh (100 μm by pressure ejection) did not occur simultaneously at different regions throughout the cell. They began usually in one region of the cell and progressed from it by an active process as a traveling spatial [Ca2+]c gradient (i.e. a Ca2+ wave; Fig. 2). In support of the active nature of its propagation, the peak [Ca2+]c amplitudes and the velocities of movement at and away from the release site (35 ± 6 μm s-1; n = 6) were undiminished as the wave progressed.Fig. 2Carbachol increased [Ca2+]c in myocytes. CCh (black bar) increased [Ca2+]c as represented by the color changes in the frames (ii) and fluorescence transients (F/F0; iii, 1-7). In contrast to those produced by depolarization, [Ca2+]c increases in response to CCh began in one part of the cell and progressed right to left (ii, B-F) throughout. The time points from which the [Ca2+]c images were obtained (ii) are indicated by the corresponding letters above the Ca2+ transients in iii. The fluorescence ratio (F/F0) changes plotted against time (iii) come from 1-pixel-wide lines (536 nm) across the cell at 20-μm intervals. (The positions of the lines are indicated in i, right-hand panel; drawn at 2 pixel widths to facilitate visualization.)

Dupont G. Berridge M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 1461-1465Crossref PubMed Scopus (545) Google Scholar). To determine whether this proposal applied to events in this smooth muscle, InsP3 was photolyzed at a small region within the cell (VM -70 mV; mean bulk average [Ca2+]c, 99 ± 21 nm, n = 7). If RyR were indeed responsible for wave propagation, then [Ca2+]c increases in response to photolysis of caged InsP3 should evoke a propagating wave at RyR by CICR. This was not observed (Fig. 3). The peak amplitude and velocity of the [Ca2+]c movement (n = 5) declined from the release site (measured at 10-μm intervals), suggesting that Ca2+ was diffusing rather than being actively propagated from the site of release. These results brought into question the importance of RyR in InsP3-initated Ca2+ wave propagation. However, at normal resting potentials (-70 mV), bulk average [Ca2+]c and hence SR luminal [Ca2+] may be low, which may in turn deactivate RyR (33Gyorke S. Fill M. Science. 1993; 260: 807-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar, 42Cheng H. Lederer M.R. Lederer W.J. Cannell M.B. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: C148-C159Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To examine further the possible contribution of RyR to wave propagation, RyR were activated, as confirmed by the emergence of STOCs (41McCarron J.G. Craig J.W. Bradley K.N. Muir T.C. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 2207-2218PubMed Google Scholar), by depolarizing the cell membrane to -20 mV (bulk [Ca2+]c, 276 ± 32 nm, n = 7). STOCs are an electrical manifestation at the sarcolemma of RyR activity (41McCarron J.G. Craig J.W. Bradley K.N. Muir T.C. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 2207-2218PubMed Google Scholar, 43Benham C.D. Bolton T.B. J. Physiol. 1986; 381: 385-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). At -20 mV, at which RyR were active, focal release of InsP3 did not evoke a propagated [Ca2+] wave; peak amplitude and velocity of [Ca2+]c movement declined from the release site, again suggesting the involvement of a diffusional rather than an active process (Fig. 3; n = 5). Clearly, wave propagation did not occur by CICR at the RyR alone, despite these receptors having been already implicated in Ca2+ wave progression in other tissues (15Boittin F-X. Macrez N Halet G. Mironneau J. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: C139-C151Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). One reason for the failure to evoke a propagating Ca2+ wave by the local release of InsP3 may have been that waves are initiated at a particular site within the cell (44Rooney T.A. Sass E.J. Thomas A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 10792-10796Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To explore this possibility, release was evoked at different sites within the same cell. However, no significant differences in the characteristics of the decline in peak amplitude of [Ca2+]c were seen at different sites in the cell (Fig. 4). These results again suggest that under normal conditions, Ca2+ released at InsP3R does not evoke propagating waves by CICR acting at RyR. Contribution of CCh and InsP3to Wave Propagation—Although local photolyzed increases in InsP3 failed to produce propagated Ca2+ waves, the InsP3-producing agonist CCh was always effective. Failure could have been due to the photolyzed increases in InsP3 being restricted to local areas within the cell, whereas wave generation required a global elevation in either InsP3 or in other agonist-induced second messengers. The question of whether a localized intracellular increase in InsP3 can evoke a Ca2+ wave was next addressed by focally releasing InsP3 in the presence of low concentrations of CCh, which, by themselves, did not evoke Ca2+ release. Low concentrations of CCh were achieved by withdrawing the ejection pipette from the cell, thus increasing the diffusion pathway and effectively reducing the concentration of CCh reaching the cell. Under these circumstances a localized increase in InsP3 successfully generated a propagating [Ca2+]c wave (Fig. 5A). To confirm the necessity of a global rather than a localized InsP3 increase in wave propagation, cells were dialyzed with InsP3 (10 μm; introduced via the patch pipette) to provide a global background of increased phosphoinositide. As expected under these conditions subsequent, focally released InsP3 evoked Ca2+ waves. At the site of photolysis, the peak [Ca2+]c increase was greater than that which occurred subsequently during passage of the wave, presumably because of the greater InsP3 concentration present after photolysis. The [Ca2+]c peak and the wave velocity thereafter remained relatively constant throughout the cell (Fig. 5B). In addition to InsP3, other agonist-activated second messengers, e.g. protein kinase C or diacylglycerol may have been necessary for wave generation (45Bird G.S.J. Rossier M.F. Obie J.F. Putney J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8425-8428Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To investigate this possibility, the effect of focally released InsP3 was examined after protein kinase C activation using indolactam or the diacylglycerol analogue, dioctanolglycerol. Neither drug enabled InsP3 to generate Ca2+ waves. For example, in controls, the Ca2+ transient amplitude declined from 3.5 ± 0.4 to 1.3 ± 0.2 F/F0 (n = 3), 50 μm from the release site. In the same cells, after protein kinase C activation with indolactam (10 μm (41McCarron J.G. Craig J.W. Bradley K.N. Muir T.C. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 2207-2218PubMed Google Scholar)), the mean Ca2+ transient amplitude declined from 2.8 ± 0.4 to 1.2 ± 0.1 F/F0, 50 μm from the release site (p > 0.5, n = 3). After dioctanolglycerol (50 μm) the decline in the peak amplitude of Ca2+ transient, with distance from the release site, was not significantly different (p > 0.05 in each) from controls. In these experiments, under control conditions the amplitude fell from 2.5 ± 0.5 at the release site to 1.6 ± 0.2 F/F0 (n = 3) 50 μm away, and in the same cells in dioctanolglycerol from 2.6 ± 0.5 to 1.3 ± 0.1 F/F0 (n = 3) 50 μm from the release site. Taken together these results show that propagation of the rising phase of the wave (the leading edge) arises from InsP3R activity and that a global elevation in InsP3 is necessary for propagation. Characteristics of the Declining Phase of the Wave—Waves progress via CICR at InsP3R; cessation of this process accounts for their decline. Either of two features of the SR could account for this decline. First, the store may not exhibit luminal continuity (thus preventing free diffusion of Ca2+ throughout) but comprise a series of separate compartments each containing a limited measure of Ca2+ and being depleted in turn as the wave progresses. Alternatively, the store may exist as one continuous compartment containing abundant Ca2+, with release being terminated by deactivation of the InsP3R, either by Ca2+ or InsP3 itself. To investigate these alternatives, caged InsP3 was photolyzed first at the same site in same cell on two consecutive occasions and, secondly, at two different sites consecutively in the same cell. In each case, the times separating the first and second photolysis were approximately the same (∼12 s). When photolysis was carried out twice at the same site, the second Ca2+ transient was reduced by about 50% overall (but on occasion it reached 80%; Fig. 6) compared with the first (Fig. 6B, i; 2.8 ± 0.5 F/F0 after the first photolysis and 1.4 ± 0.7 F/F0 after the second; n = 6; p < 0.05). This reduction is likely to have been due to a failure of the store to respond to InsP3 rather than to an absence of InsP3 in the region because of exhaustion of the caged compound by previous photolysis. There was a constant supply of InsP3 from the patch pipette available to the cell, and assuming the diffusion coefficient (D) of caged InsP3 is similar to that of InsP3 (estimated as 2 × 10-6 μm2/s), InsP3 would have"
https://openalex.org/W2032117718,"Bacterial resistance to the third-generation cephalosporins is an issue of great concern in current antibiotic therapeutics. An important source of this resistance is from production of extended-spectrum (ES) β-lactamases by bacteria. The Enterobacter cloacae GC1 enzyme is an example of a class C ES β-lactamase. Unlike wild-type (WT) forms, such as the E. cloacae P99 and Citrobacter freundii enzymes, the ES GC1 β-lactamase is able to rapidly hydrolyze third-generation cephalosporins such as cefotaxime and ceftazidime. To understand the basis for this ES activity, m-nitrophenyl 2-(2-aminothiazol-4-yl)-2-[(Z)-methoxyimino]acetylaminomethyl phosphonate has been synthesized and characterized. This phosphonate was designed to generate a transition state analog for turnover of cefotaxime. The crystal structures of complexes of the phosphonate with both ES GC1 and WT C. freundii GN346 β-lactamases have been determined to high resolution (1.4–1.5 Å). The serine-bound analog of the tetrahedral transition state for deacylation exhibits a very different binding geometry in each enzyme. In the WT β-lactamase the cefotaxime-like side chain is crowded against the Ω loop and must protrude from the binding site with its methyloxime branch exposed. In the ES enzyme, a mutated Ω loop adopts an alternate conformation allowing the side chain to be much more buried. During the binding and turnover of the cefotaxime substrate by this ES enzyme, it is proposed that ligand-protein contacts and intra-ligand contacts are considerably relieved relative to WT, facilitating positioning and activation of the hydrolytic water molecule. The ES β-lactamase is thus able to efficiently inactivate third-generation cephalosporins.

The ES β-lactamase is thus able to efficiently inactivate third-generation cephalosporins. β-Lactam antibiotics are widely used because of their effectiveness and safety. However, β-lactam-resistant bacteria have become widespread. The main cause of this resistance is the production of β-lactamases, which hydrolyze the amide bond in the β-lactam ring. β-Lactamases are grouped into four classes, A–D, on the basis of amino acid sequence. Although class B β-lactamases are metallo-β-lactamases, class A, C, and D β-lactamases are serine-reactive hydrolases that function by acylation and deacylation steps employing tetrahedral intermediates (1Matagne A. Dubus A. Galleni M. Frere J.-M. Nat. Prod. Rep. 1999; 16: 1-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar, 2Kotra L.P. Samama J.-P. Mobashery S. Lewis K. Salyers A.A. Taber H.W. Wax R.G. Bacterial Resistance to Antimicrobials. Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York2001: 123-159Google Scholar) (see Reaction 1). To overcome β-lactam resistance, third-generation cephalosporins such as cefotaxime (1), ceftazidime (2), and ceftriaxon have been employed since the 1980s because of their relative stability to serine β-lactamases and their broad antibacterial spectrum. Third-generation cephalosporins typically contain a bulky group such as a 2-(2-aminothiazole-4-yl)-2-oxyimino substituent (R1) at position C7 of the cephalosporin nucleus. From the kinetic perspective, third-generation cephalosporins show high Km and low kcat values for class A and D β-lactamases, and low Km(Ki) and low kcat values for class C enzymes. This behavior suggests that these cephalosporins cannot effectively bind to the active site of wild-type (WT) 1The abbreviations used are: WT, wild-type, non-ES; EDC, 1-[3-(dimethylamino)propyl]-3-ethylcarbodiimide hydrochloride; ES, extended spectrum; MPD, 2-methyl-2,4-pentanediol; PEG, polyethylene glycol; r.m.s.d., root-mean-squared deviation; MS, mass spectrometry; ESI, electrospray ionization. class A β-lactamases and acylate them but can bind to and rapidly acylate class C enzymes to form stable acyl intermediates. Extensive use of third-generation cephalosporins has provided selective pressure leading to the appearance of extended-spectrum (ES) β-lactamases (3Petrosino J. Cantu C. Palzkill T. Trends Microbiol. 1998; 6: 323-327Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). These ES β-lactamases are able to hydrolyze third-generation cephalosporins as a result of mutations in a parental β-lactamase. Most ES β-lactamases belong to class A and are plasmid-mediated, such as those in the TEM and SHV families (4Knox J.R. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1995; 39: 2593-2601Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). 2G. Jacoby and K. Bush, see www.lahey.org/studies/webt.stm for a listing of ES β-lactamases. In 1995, the first class C chromosomal ES β-lactamase was discovered in Enterobacter cloacae GC1 (6Nukaga M. Haruta S. Tanimoto K. Kogure K. Taniguchi K. Tamaki M. Sawai T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5729-5735Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Kinetic and mutagenesis experiments with the ES GC1 enzyme revealed an improved deacylation activity that is somehow due to a unique three-residue repeat insertion (7Nukaga M. Taniguchi K. Washio Y. Sawai T. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 10461-10468Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The crystal structure of the ES GC1 enzyme shows the insertion makes the Ω loop at the bottom of the binding site more flexible compared with the parental WT E. cloacae P99 enzyme (8Crichlow G.V. Kuzin A.P. Nukaga M. Sawai T. Knox J.R. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 10256-10261Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). It was suggested that a conformational change in ES GC1 permits the enzyme to accommodate cephalosporins with large R1 side chains and allows more conformational freedom for the acyl intermediate. However, although structural information is available for cephalosporins and monobactams bound to WT class C β-lactamases (9Oefner C. D'Arcy A. Daly J.J. Gubernator K. Charnas R.L. Heinze I.

Structure. 2002; 10: 413-424Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), no information is available for a β-lactam bound to an ES β-lactamase. Because the ES GC1 β-lactamase can effectively hydrolyze cefotaxime (1) and ceftazidime (2), its intermediates with these important β-lactams are difficult to visualize by x-ray crystallography. For this study, phosphonate 4 was designed to produce a tetrahedral transition state analog for cefotaxime hydrolysis. We report two crystal structures of the phosphonate complexed with both ES and WT β-lactamases from E. cloacae GC1 and Citrobacter freundii GN346, respectively. Large differences in the binding of the analog and in the conformation of the Ω loop of the enzymes are revealed, which provide better understanding of the hydrolysis of third-generation cephalosporins by ES class C β-lactamases (see Structures 1–7). The substrate cephalothin 3 was a gift from Eli Lilly and Co. The phosphonate 5 and the depsipeptides 6 and 7 were available from previous studies (12Rahil J. Pratt R.F. J. Chem. Soc. Perkin Trans.

A., Nukaga, M., and Pratt, R. F. (2004) Biochemistry, in press. Synthetic Methods—m-Nitrophenyl 2-(2-aminothiazol-4-yl)-2-[(Z)-methoxyimino]acetylaminomethyl phosphonate (4) was synthesized. This compound was prepared by the Scheme 1 reaction sequence (outlined in Structures 8–10). First, the hydroxysuccinimide ester of 2-(2-aminothiazol-4-yl)-2-(Z)-methoxyiminoacetic acid (8) was prepared as described previously. 3Kumar, S., Adediran, S. A., Nukaga, M., and Pratt, R. F. (2004) Biochemistry, in press. It was then condensed with aminomethylphosphonic acid to afford 2-(2-aminothiazol-4-yl)-2-[(Z)-methoxyimino-]acetylaminomethylphosphonic acid (9). Thus, to a solution of aminomethylphosphonic acid (2.5 g, 22.5 mmol) in water (37 ml) was added sodium hydrogen carbonate (6.25 g, 74.4 mmol) and potassium carbonate (13.7 g, 99.4 mmol), and the mixture was stirred at room temperature until all components were dissolved. To this was added 7 (8.06 g, 27 mmol), and the reaction mixture was stirred at room temperature for 26 h. After quenching the reaction by the addition of water (37 ml), the resulting mixture was filtered and the filtrate was acidified to pH 3.2 using concentrated hydrochloric acid. This solution was extracted with ethyl acetate (3 × 100 ml), and the aqueous layer was freeze-dried. The excess salt was removed using an ion retardation (Bio-Rad AG 11 A8) column. The resulting crude product was redissolved in the minimum amount of hot water (12 ml) on a steam bath, and the pH was bought to 3. Crystallization from the chilled saturated solution, facilitated by slow addition of acetone (total 8.5 ml) over 2 days, yielded pure product 9 in 12% yield (0.810 g). 1H NMR spectrum (2H2O): δ 3.60 (d, J = 12 Hz, 2H, PCH2), 4.02 (s, 3H, OCH3), and 7.17 (s, 1H, thiazole-4H) (Structures 8–10). The m-nitrophenyl ester 10 was then prepared as follows. To a solution of well dried 9 (0.316 g, 1.14 mmol) in pyridine (6 ml), freshly distilled from barium oxide, was added dry m-nitrophenol (0.190 g, 1.36 mmol). After the mixture had been stirred for 15 min at room temperature under nitrogen, trichloroacetonitrile (1.9 ml, 18.9 mmol) was added, and the reaction mixture was stirred at 80 °C for 6.5 h. Pyridine was removed by evaporation at room temperature with an oil pump overnight, and the dark brown crude material was taken into saturated sodium hydrogen carbonate (13 ml) and extracted with ethyl acetate (7 × 20 ml). The residue from the organic layer after solvent evaporation was stirred under a nitrogen atmosphere with 100 ml of a water chloroform (1:1) mixture at room temperature. The crude product (10) partitioned into the aqueous layer and was purified by passage, in water, through a Sephadex G-10 column. 1H NMR spectrum (2H2O): δ 3.81 (d, J = 12 Hz, 2H, PCH2), 3.99 (s, 3H, OCH3), and 7.42–8.10 (m, 5H, ArH, thiazole-4H); MS (ESI): 558.5. After unsuccessful attempts to remove the N-trichloroacetyl group from 10 with lithium hydroxide and sodium borohydride, the following procedure was adopted. The N-acylated compound 10 (0.132 g, 0.236 mmol) was stirred with 8.25 ml of 1 m hydroxylamine hydrochloride buffer (pH 6.0) for 22 h, and the progress of the reaction was monitored by high-performance liquid chromatography. When the reaction was complete, the mixture was freeze-dried. Purification as the sodium salt was achieved by Sephadex G-10 column chromatography to give the product 4 in 32% (0.035 g) yield. 1H NMR spectrum (2H2O): δ 3.79 (d, J = 12 Hz, 2H, PCH2), 3.94 (s, 3H, OCH3), 6.92 (s, 1H, thiazole-4H), and 7.52–8.1 (m, 4H, ArH); MS (ESI): 414.3. Subcloning and Protein Purification—Plasmid pCFC-plac-1, a derivative of pCFC-1, was used as the source of the C. freundii GN346 β-lactamase (GenBank™ accession number X51632). In pCFC-plac-1, expression of β-lactamase is controlled by the lac promoter of pHSG398. Plasmid pCS101, a derivative of pTTQ18, was used for E. cloacae GC1 as described previously (8Crichlow G.V. Kuzin A.P. Nukaga M. Sawai T. Knox J.R. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 10256-10261Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 15Nukaga M. KiKuo T. Yamaguchi H. Sawai T. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1994; 38: 1374-1377Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Escherichia coli AS226–51, an ampD mutant of C600 and also a deletion mutant of ampC, was used as host for β-lactamase expression. E. coli carrying pCFC-plac-1 or pCS101 were grown at 37 °C in Terrific broth containing a sub-lethal concentration of kanamycin (30 μg/ml). In mid-logarithmic phase, 0.5 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was added, and the culture was continued for 12 h. Crude β-lactamase was obtained by disrupting the cells with a French press in 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7, followed by centrifugation for 1 h at 40,000 × g and 4 °C. β-Lactamase was applied to a CM-Sephadex C-50 (Amersham Biosciences) column in 10 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7, and eluted with a 0–0.5 m linear NaCl gradient. Active fractions were further purified with an m-aminophenyl boronic acid affinity column using Affi-Gel-10 (Bio-Rad) with a 0–0.5 m linear borate gradient, followed by G-75 (Amersham Biosciences) gel filtration in 100 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7, to remove borate. The E. cloacae P99 β-lactamase was purchased from the Centre for Applied Microbiology and Research (Porton Down, Wiltshire, UK). Kinetic Methods—The inactivation rate constants (ki) for essentially irreversible inhibition of the enzymes by 4 and 5 were obtained by incubating the inhibitor (1–20 μm) with enzyme (0.25 μm) in 20 mm MOPS buffer, pH 7.5, at 25 °C. Suitable aliquots were withdrawn from the incubation mixtures with time, and the activity of the enzyme was measured by diluting the incubation mixture into the assay solution of the substrate cephalothin 3 (200 μm). The initial rate of hydrolysis of the substrate was then monitored spectrophotometrically at 278 nm. Pseudo-first order inactivation rate constants were obtained by fitting the initial rates to an exponential function in time. Second order rate constants (ki) were determined by dividing the pseudo-first order rate constant by the inhibitor concentration. Crystallographic Methods—Crystals were grown by the vapor diffusion method at room temperature. The WT GN346 β-lactamase was co-crystallized with the phosphonate 4. The protein drop containing 7.5 mg/ml protein, 8% PEG (Mr 8000), 4% MPD, 0.01 m urea, 0.2 mm4, and 0.04 m HEPES, pH 7.5, was placed over a reservoir of 20% PEG, 10% MPD, and 0.1 m HEPES, pH 7.5. Crystals appeared in 10–20 days. Macroseeding was necessary to get larger crystals of average size 0.3 × 0.3 × 0.5 mm. They have space group P212121 with one monomer of 39.1 kDa in the asymmetric unit. Apo-ES GC1 β-lactamase was crystallized from a protein drop containing 10 mg/ml protein, 10% PEG, and 50 mm HEPES, pH 7, placed over a reservoir of 20% PEG in 0.1 m HEPES, pH 7 (8Crichlow G.V. Kuzin A.P. Nukaga M. Sawai T. Knox J.R. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 10256-10261Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Thin plate-like crystals with average size 0.05 × 0.2 × 0.8 mm appeared in 10–20 days in P21212 with one monomer of 39.4 kDa in the asymmetric unit. Data for ES GC1 and WT GN346 crystals were collected at 100 K at MacCHESS station A1 at Cornell University or the JASRI/SPring8 beamline BL40B2 in Hyogo, Japan, respectively. A GC1 crystal was placed in a solution of 2 mm phosphonate 4, 25% PEG, and 0.1 m HEPES, pH 7, for 90 min before mounting. After soaking, the crystal was briefly dipped into a PEG solution containing 20% glycerol to prevent ice crystal formation upon cryocooling. A GN346 crystal, cocrystallized with 4 and the cryoprotectant MPD, was directly mounted from the drop and flash cooled. Intensities were indexed and scaled using the HKL package (16Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38617) Google Scholar).

Inactivation Kinetics—Phosphonate monoesters such as 5, bearing a classic penicillin side chain, have been shown to inactivate WT class C β-lactamases by covalent modification of the active site serine residue (17Rahil J. Pratt R.F. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 5869-5878Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 18Lobkovsky E. Billings E.M. Moews P.C. Rahil J. Pratt R.F. Knox J.R. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 6762-6772Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Incorporation of a third-generation cephalosporin side chain leads to 4, which also inactivates these enzymes. Relevant inactivation rate constants are shown in Table II. The new phosphonate 4 is some 10-fold less reactive than 5 with a WT enzyme (P99). This presumably reflects the effect of the bulkier side chain of 4. This difference between the ki values of 4 and 5 is reduced to less than 3-fold in the case of the ES enzyme (GC1). This change may result from the somewhat easier fit of the rather congested penta-coordinated intermediate/transition state (17Rahil J. Pratt R.F. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 5869-5878Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), also bearing the bulky oxyimino side chain, into the ES GC1 active site than into that of the P99 enzyme. The phosphonate 4 is somewhat more reactive with the WT C. freundii enzyme than with the WT E. cloacae P99 enzyme; this may reflect the Glu/Gln amino acid difference at position 219 (19Tsukamoto K. Ohno R. Nukaga M. Sawai T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 207: 1123-1127Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar).Table IIKinetic parameters for reaction of class C β-lactamases with phosphonates and depsipeptidesEnzymePhosphonatekiDepsipeptidekcat/Km × 10-5kcats-1 m-1s-1 m-1s-1WT P995227075.4125420263.3130WT GN3464760ES GC1519071.95949062.446 Open table in a new tab Although we anticipated that the adduct formed between the phosphonates and these β-lactamases would mimic the tetrahedral intermediates/transition states of β-lactam turnover in several essential details, they would, of course, more directly resemble transient species in the hydrolysis of the depsipeptides 6 and 7, and, in particular, the deacylation tetrahedral intermediates 11 (Structure 11). The data of Table II show that 6 and 7 are turned over by a WT and an ES class C β-lactamase with similar facility; the bulky side chain of 6 seems to have little effect. This situation contrasts sharply with the relative turnover rates of cephalosporins 1 and 3 where that of the former is greatly impeded.3 Apparently the resistance of third-generation cephalosporins to hydrolysis by WT class C β-lactamases requires the presence of both the oxyimino side chain and the dihydothiazine ring, as previously suggested by Powers et al. on structural grounds (20Powers R.A. Blazquez J. Weston G.S. Morosini M.-I. Baquero F. Shoichet B.K. Protein Sci. 1999; 8: 2330-2337Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). One solution to the problem to WT enzymes posed by third-generation cephalosporins, which is found in the ES GC1 enzyme, is revealed by the crystal structures described below for complexes formed between the phosphonate 4 and WT (C. freundii GN346) and ES (E. cloacae GC1) enzymes. Structure Determination and Refinement—Molecular replacement and rigid-body refinement using the unliganded ES GC1 (Protein Data Bank entry 1GCE) and WT GN346 (1FR1) β-lactamases was done at 2 Å with CNS (21Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clove G.M. Delano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.-S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16979) Google Scholar). R-factors were 35–38% for the unsolvated apo-protein models. Because the models were being optimized by simulated annealing (22Brunger A.T. Nature. 1992; 355: 472-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (3872) Google Scholar), a Ser-64-bound moiety was evident in the high resolution difference density of both complexes. Based on previous work (18Lobkovsky E. Billings E.M. Moews P.C. Rahil J. Pratt R.F. Knox J.R. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 6762-6772Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar), phosphonate 4, devoid of the m-nitrophenol leaving group, was added to each model. XtalView (23McRee D.E. J. Struct. Biol. 1999; 125: 156-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (2022) Google Scholar) was employed for mapping and manipulation of the structures. The last stage of the higher resolution refinement of ES GC1 was performed with SHELX (24Sheldrick G.M. Schneider T.R. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 277: 319-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (1892) Google Scholar) using all F > 0σ(F) data (Table III). At 1.38-Å resolution, anisotropic B-factor refinement reduced the R and Rfree values by 4 and 1%, respectively, to 15.0% and 21.1%. Riding hydrogen atoms were later added in calculated positions. The Ω loop (generally residues 200–226) in the ES GC1 complex was observed to have two conformations from 219 to 225, and this part was modeled with unequal occupancies (0.75/0.25). As described below, an “open” Ω conformer has the higher occupancy here and is thought to occur only in a complex, whereas the lower occupancy “closed” conformer can exist in either the ligand-free or complexed enzyme (8Crichlow G.V. Kuzin A.P. Nukaga M. Sawai T. Knox J.R. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 10256-10261Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 25Nukaga M. Abe T. Venkatesan A.M. Mansour T.S. Bonomo R.A. Knox J.R. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 13152-13159Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Likewise, two sets of water molecules were modeled in the complexed and apo binding sites with 0.75 and 0.25 occupancies, respectively. Only the closed conformer was seen for the Ω loop in the WT GN346 enzyme. Ramachandran analysis of the final ES GC1 and WT GN346 models showed 92.2% and 93.8% of backbone angles, respectively, fall in most favored regions, and none fall in disallowed regions. Final R/Rfree values for the ES GC1 and WT GN346 complexes are 13.9/19.5% and 19.5/21.7%, respectively.Table IIICrystallographic refinementsβ-LactamaseES GC1WT GN346Program used for final refinementSHELXCNSResolution range (Å)20-1.3820-1.52No. of reflections used [F > 0σ(F)]64,64856,236Rwork/Rfree (%)13.9/19.519.5/21.7Rtotal14.219.7Residues in Ramachandran zones (%)Favored/allowed92.2/7.893.8/6.2Disallowed00r.m.s.d. values from idealityBond lengths (Å)0.0170.006Bond angles (Å/deg.)0.0331.4Chiral volumes (Å3)/improper (deg.)0.0620.83Mean B-factorsProtein (no.)15.8 (2875)17.7 (2878)Inhibitor (occupancy/no.)28.1 (0.75/17)19.9 (1.0/17)Glycerol/MPD (no.)29.1 (12)36.5 (8)Water molecules (no.)31.2 (399)29.0 (414)All atoms (no.)17.8 (3303)19.1 (3309) Open table in a new tab Phosphonate Binding—The electron density of the irreversibly bound (17Rahil J. Pratt R.F. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 5869-5878Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) phosphonate in each complex is shown in Fig. 1. In the WT GN346 complex, the density of the terminal methyl group of the oxime is rather weak. The entire ligand, however, has a reasonable B-factor (20 Å2) about 35% lower than that for the ligand in the ES GC1 complex. In this ES complex, the phosphonate was modeled with a partial occupancy (0.75) that matches the occupancy of one of the two Ω-loop conformations. Fig. 2 shows the binding site in the mixed α-β tertiary structure of the WT class C GN346 β-lactamase. Except in the Ω loop, the ES GC1 molecule is folded similarly. The phosphonate lies between two domains, an all-α-helical domain and an α/β domain containing a 5-stranded antiparallel β-sheet surrounded by α-helices.Fig. 2Stereoview of the tertiary structure of the class C WT GN346 β-lactamase with the acyl-phosphonate.

The terminal P-O1 group displaces a water molecule from the oxyanion hole formed by the backbone amide groups of Ser-64 and Ser-318/321 (using numbering for the WT GN346 and ES GC1 β-lactamases, respectively). The oxygen atom is asymmetrically hydrogen-bonded to the amides, with the stronger and more linear hydrogen bond to the NH on the B3 β-strand (distances E and F, Table IV and Fig. 3). The remaining P-O2 group is exposed. It hydrogen bonds to the hydroxyl group of Tyr-150 and to a water molecule bridging to Thr-316/319 on the B3 strand (distances C and D, Table IV). Each complex has a similar conformation in the Ser-64-Oγ-P linkage, as described by the dihedral angles.Table IVConformations and distances in the phosphorylated β-lactamases Distances are rounded to the nearest 0.05 Å.Dihedral angle (°)ES GC1WT GN346SerCα-Cβ-Oγ-P115106SerCβ-Oγ-P-CH2–164–162SerOγ-P-CH2-NH81142P-CH2-NH-CO–128155NH-CO-C-C75–102Distance (Å, Fig. 3)A2.802.80B3.102.90C3.003.10D3.202.80E2.902.75F2.702.65G3.003.10H3.403.00I5.752.80 Open table in a new tab Differences in Phosphonate Binding in WT and ES Enzymes— The orientation and conformation of the cefotaxime-like side chain of the phosphonate is markedly different in the two complexes (Fig. 4a). In the WT GN346 binding site, the oxyimino branch is solvent-exposed, but in the ES GC1 complex the oxyimino branch is quite buried. The two methyloxime positions are ∼10 Å apart as a result of large rotations, including an almost 180° flip about the CO–C bond (Table IV). Because the acylamide linkages have different spatial positions, the two aminothiazole rings lie in approximately the same position, however. In each complex a hydrogen bond exists between the NH group of the acylamide and the backbone CO group of Ser-318/321 (distance G). Binding by the CO group of the acylamides, potentially by means of hydrogen bonding to the NH2 groups of the Gln-120 and Asn-152 side chains (distances H and I) (10Powers R.A. Caselli E. Focia P.J. Prati F. Shoichet B.K. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 9207-9214Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 18Lobkovsky E. Billings E.M. Moews P.C. Rahil J. Pratt R.F. Knox J.R. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 6762-6772Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar), differs considerably in the two structures and is essentially absent in the ES complex, because the CO group of the phosphonate has shifted inward by 2.5 Å. It is notable that neither the oxyimino group nor the aminothiazole group engages either β-lactamase in direct hydrogen bonding. The apparently looser binding of the phosphonate side chain within the less-restricted binding site of the ES enzyme, evidenced by the larger B-factor of the ligand, may provide the extra motion or conformational freedom necessary for a more facile hydrolysis of cefotaxime by this extended-spectrum β-lactamase. Structural Factors Influencing Binding—The primary structural determinant of the large difference in phosphonate orientation in the two complexes is the Ω loop at the bottom of the binding site (Figs. 2 and 4b). In the WT complex, the aminothiazole ring has its edge only 3.5 Å from the ring of Tyr-221, forming a perpendicular quadrupolar interaction. This contact with the Ω loop causes the phosphonate to tilt out of the WT binding site, exposing the methyl end of the oxyimino branch. In the ES complex, a quite different orientation is found because the Ω loop of the enzyme, longer by a 3-residue insertion, can adopt an alternative folding. This conformational change in the Ω loop is presumably initiated by contact between Tyr-221 (numbered 224 in GC1) and an early reaction intermediate, as seen in other GC1 complexes (25Nukaga M. Abe T. Venkatesan A.M. Mansour T.S. Bonomo R.A. Knox J.R. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 13152-13159Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 26Crichlow G.V. Nukaga M. Doppalapudi V.R. Buynak J.D. Knox J.R. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 6233-6239Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The expanded Ω loop refolds to a more open conformation so that Tyr-224 moves as much as 10 Å from its WT position, a position now occupied by the methyl group of the oxyimino branch. The cefotaxime-like side chain of the phosphonate is therefore more buried in the ES GC1 complex than in the WT complex. This new binding mode in the ES enzyme is facilitated by the absence of two hydrogen bonds to Gln-120 and Asn-152, present in WT, and by the formation of weak hydrophobic interactions, which pull the intermediate deeper into the binding pocket. Refolding of the Ω loop in the ES β-lactamase to make more space for the side chain (Fig. 4b) does not explain the large rotation, relative to WT, about the CO–C bond of the phosphonate. It is likely that hydrophobic or polar interactions determine which rotamer is stabilized. It seems that the methyl group of the oxime, rather than the more polar aminothiazole ring, better replaces the (shifted) Tyr-224 on the flexible Ω loop of the ES enzyme. But in the WT enzyme, the other phosphonate rotamer is found, because the aminothiazole ring can form a quadrupole-quadrupole interaction with the (immovable) ring of Tyr-221 on the more rigid Ω loop. Comparison with Related Complexes—No crystal structure is available of cefotaxime (1) bound to a β-lactamase. A structure is known of the acyl complex of cefotaxime with an ancestrally related penicillin-binding protein, the Streptomyces R61 d-alanyl-d-alanine-peptidase (27Kuzin A.P. Liu H. Kelly J.A. Knox J.R. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 9532-9540Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 28Knox J.R. Moews P.C. Frere J.-M. Chem. & Biol. 1996; 3: 937-947Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). The R1 side chain of 1 is found with the same rotameric conformation seen in the ES β-lactamase, but steric contacts push the cefotaxime outward, as in the WT β-lactamase analog. Thus, the peptidase and WT β-lactamase, each poor deacylators of the acyl intermediate of cefotaxime, are unable to bury the intermediate and, therefore, unable to access the resultant binding energy for catalysis as well as the ES β-lactamase can. Structures of the acyl-enzyme derived from ceftazidime (2) and its boronic acid tetrahedral analog with the WT AmpC β-lactamase are known (10Powers R.A. Caselli E. Focia P.J. Prati F. Shoichet B.K. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 9207-9214Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). The aminothiazole-oxyimino groups of the boronic acid and phosphonate analogs superpose very closely (Fig. 5a, 0.7 Å r.m.s.d. for common atoms). Further, the R1 side chain of the ceftazidime complex is similarly oriented with these analogs (Fig. 5b), supporting the assumption that studies of tetrahedral analogs can provide information about the binding and turnover of third-generation cephalosporins. Crowding and Hydrolysis—The inability of the wild-type class C β-lactamases to effectively hydrolyze some third-generation cephalosporins has been addressed in structural terms (10Powers R.A. Caselli E. Focia P.J. Prati F. Shoichet B.K. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 9207-9214Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 11Beadle B.M. Trehan I. Shoichet B.K.

Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 6233-6239Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Not only ligand-protein contacts but also intra-ligand contacts can reduce the conformational freedom of the acyl intermediate prior to deacylation. Specifically, contact of the branched aminothiazole-oxime side chain with the closed conformer of the Ω loop (contact A, Fig. 6a) results in a close approach of this side chain to the tethered dihydrothiazine ring (contact B). This intra-ligand crowding is likely to hamper deacylation, either by impeding the movement of catalytic residues or of the dihydrothiazine ring if substrate assistance plays a role. Any restraint of ring movement would mean that the ring nitrogen atom and/or the C4 carboxyl group could not position or activate the attacking water molecule. An examination of the WT binding site shows that contacts A and B cannot be easily relieved, because they are opposed by a third close contact against the 290s loop at the top of the binding site (contact C). Interestingly, this loop is disordered in one of the two molecules in the WT AmpC ceftazidime complex (10Powers R.A. Caselli E. Focia P.J. Prati F. Shoichet B.K. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 9207-9214Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar) (Fig. 6b). But no disorder was reported in the 290s loop in the smaller boronic acid analog, which lacks the thiazine ring, and we see no disorder in WT GN346 with the similarly sized phosphonate analog. Further evidence for the importance of contacts B and C in deacylation is seen in the depsipeptide results of Table II, where it is clear that, in the absence of the thiazine ring, rapid and unencumbered hydrolysis occurs. We note that forced mutagenesis of class C β-lactamases using branched cephalosporins has produced many mutations that are localized in the 290s loop (29Siemers N.O. Yelton D.E. Bajorath J.

In the ES GC1 variant, with the flexible, multiconformation Ω loop at the bottom of the binding site, no mutations exist in the 290s loop. Nor is structural disorder in the 290s loop expected, and none has been observed to date (25Nukaga M. Abe T. Venkatesan A.M. Mansour T.S. Bonomo R.A. Knox J.R. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 13152-13159Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 26Crichlow G.V. Nukaga M. Doppalapudi V.R. Buynak J.D. Knox J.R. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 6233-6239Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The open conformer of the mobile Ω loop of the extended spectrum GC1 β-lactamase permits burial of the third-generation side chain of cefotaxime into the class C β-lactamase active site. The additional binding energy thus obtained and the minimal steric disruption of the active site allow the ES enzyme to efficiently catalyze hydrolysis of branched cephalosporins; bacterial resistance to these antibiotics is thus achieved. Should the ES GC1 β-lactamase become a more widespread clinical problem, new cephalosporin derivatives bearing even larger oxyimino branches might be explored. X-ray data for ES GC1 were obtained at the Cornell High Energy Synchrotron Source (CHESS, supported by National Science Foundation award DMR-9311772), using the Macromolecular Diffraction facility (MacCHESS, supported by National Institutes of Health award RR-01646).

All experiments were performed using monolayers of T84 colonic epithelial cells grown on permeable supports. Protein phosphorylation and protein-protein interactions were analyzed by immunoprecipitation and Western blotting. Cl- secretion was measured as changes in short-circuit current (ΔIsc) across voltage-clamped T84 cells. The GsPCR agonist, vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP; 100 n○), rapidly stimulated EGFr phosphorylation in T84 cells. This effect was mimicked by a cell-permeant analog of cAMP, Bt2cAMP/AM (3 μ○), and was attenuated by the protein kinase A (PKA) inhibitor, H-89 (20 μ○). The EGFr inhibitor, tyrphostin AG1478 (1 μ○), inhibited both Bt2cAMP/AM-stimulated EGFr phosphorylation and Isc responses. VIP and Bt2cAMP/AM both stimulated ERK MAPK phosphorylation and recruitment of the p85 subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) to the EGFr in a tyrphostin AG1478-sensitive manner. The PI3K inhibitor, wortmannin (50 n○), but not the ERK inhibitor, PD 98059 (20 μ○), attenuated Bt2cAMP/AM-stimulated secretory responses. We conclude that GsPCR agonists rapidly transactivate the EGFr in T84 cells by a signaling pathway involving cAMP and PKA. Through a mechanism that likely involves PI3K, transactivation of the EGFr is required for the full expression of cAMP-dependent Cl- secretory responses. We have previously shown that Gq protein-coupled receptor (GqPCR) agonists stimulate epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFr) transactivation and activation of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) in colonic epithelial cells. This constitutes a mechanism by which Cl- secretory responses to GqPCR agonists are limited. In the present study we examined a possible role for the EGFr in regulating Cl- secretion stimulated by agonists that act through GsPCRs. All experiments were performed using monolayers of T84 colonic epithelial cells grown on permeable supports. Protein phosphorylation and protein-protein interactions were analyzed by immunoprecipitation and Western blotting. Cl- secretion was measured as changes in short-circuit current (ΔIsc) across voltage-clamped T84 cells.

The PI3K inhibitor, wortmannin (50 n○), but not the ERK inhibitor, PD 98059 (20 μ○), attenuated Bt2cAMP/AM-stimulated secretory responses. We conclude that GsPCR agonists rapidly transactivate the EGFr in T84 cells by a signaling pathway involving cAMP and PKA. Through a mechanism that likely involves PI3K, transactivation of the EGFr is required for the full expression of cAMP-dependent Cl- secretory responses. The transport of fluid across the intestinal epithelium is a passive process that is driven by the active transport of ions. Under normal circumstances, net absorption of ions and fluid predominates, which prevents excessive loss of water from the body along with the feces. However, some conditions, for example, the presence of food or bacterial-derived antigens in the lumen, can trigger rapid conversion of the intestine from its normally absorptive to a secretory phenotype. Under normal circumstances it is thought that this process is protective in that it constitutes an innate defense mechanism by which toxic substances are flushed from the intestine before they gain access to the systemic circulation. However, in addition to inhibiting absorptive processes, certain pathological conditions can induce overexpression of this defense mechanism resulting in excessive and prolonged secretion of Cl- by the epithelium. Since Cl- secretion is the predominant driving force for fluid secretion in the intestine, this can lead to the clinical manifestation of diarrhea, a prominent and disabling symptom of several intestinal disorders, including inflammatory bowel diseases and enteric bacterial infections (1Powell D.W. Yamada T. Textbook of Gastroenterology. Lippincott-Williams-Wilkins, Philadelphia1999: 858-909Google Scholar). The molecular mechanisms by which epithelial Cl- secretion is regulated are only partly understood. Typically, Cl- secretion is promoted by neuroimmune mediators that bind to specific G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) 1The abbreviations used are: GPCR, G protein-coupled receptor; Bt2cAMP/AM, dibutyryl cyclic AMP/acetoxymethyl ester; CFTR, cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator; EGF, epidermal growth factor; EGFr, EGF receptor; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase; GqPCR, Gq protein-coupled receptor; Isc, short circuit current; ΔIsc, change in short circuit current; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; PI3K, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase; PKA, protein kinase A; VIP, vasoactive intestinal polypeptide; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; FSK, forskolin. on the cell surface to elevate intracellular levels of second messengers. GqPCR agonists elevate intracellular levels of Ca2+, whereas GsPCR agonists activate adenylate cyclase and stimulate accumulation of cAMP. In turn, elevations in the levels of intracellular messengers bring about alterations in the activity of the ion transport proteins that constitute the epithelial secretory machinery. Transepithelial Cl- secretion is followed by passive, paracellular movement of cations, particularly Na+, and the net accumulation of salt in the intestinal lumen creates an osmotic driving force for fluid secretion to occur (2Barrett K.E. Keely S.J. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2000; 62: 535-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar). Although neuroimmune agonists that activate either Gq or GsPCRs both promote intestinal Cl- secretion, they do so with distinctive kinetics. Although GsPCR-induced secretory responses are typically slow in onset and sustained, those induced by activation of GqPCRs and elevations in intracellular Ca2+ are rapid in onset and transient, even in the continued presence of agonist. These observations previously led us to speculate that inhibitory signaling mechanisms may exist within epithelial cells that serve to limit the extent and duration of Ca 2+-dependent secretory responses. In this regard, our previous studies have shown that, at the same time they stimulate Cl- secretion, Ca2+-dependent GqPCR agonists, typified by the muscarinic agonist carbachol, stimulate transactivation of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFr) with subsequent activation of the ERK and p38 isoforms of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) (3Keely S.J.

This signaling pathway appears to limit the extent of Ca+-dependent secretory responses, and we proposed that it may act as a physiological braking mechanism to prevent excessive Cl- and, consequently, fluid loss from the body in conditions where neuroimmune mediators that act through GqPCRs are increased within the intestinal mucosa. Indeed, the role that the EGFr plays in modulating epithelial responses to various physiological and pathophysiological stimuli has been the subject of much research interest in recent years (6Liebmann C.

However, as yet, there is little information regarding the role of EGFr-dependent signaling mechanisms in regulating cellular responses to agonists that bind to GsPCRs thereby eliciting elevations in intracellular cAMP. Data that do exist in this regard are conflicting. Although studies in COS-7 and neuronal PC12 cells indicate that cAMP-dependent agonists have the capability to induce EGFr transactivation (18Maudsley S. Pierce K.L. Zamah A.M. Miller W.E. Ahn S.

Thus, it seems likely that heterogeneity exists in the role that EGFr-dependent signaling mechanisms play in modulating GsPCR-induced responses in different systems. In the present study we have investigated a potential role for transactivation of the EGFr in regulating Cl- secretory responses to neuroimmune agonists that activate GsPCRs in intestinal epithelial cells. The data we present indicate a novel role for the EGFr in mediating the full expression of cAMP-dependent epithelial secretory responses. Materials—Dibutyryl cyclic AMP, acetoxymethyl ester (Bt2cAMP/AM) was obtained from Molecular Probes Inc. (Eugene, OR). Vasoactive intestinal polypeptide and forskolin were obtained from Sigma Chemical Co. (St. Louis, MO). Tyrphostin AG1478, PP2, PD 98059, wortmannin, LY 290042, and PD 153035 were from Calbiochem (San Diego, CA). Antiphosphotyrosine (PY20; monoclonal IgG2bk) was obtained from BD Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY). Anti-p85 PI3K (rabbit IgG) and anti-human EGF receptor (mouse IgG) were from Upstate Biotechnology Inc. (Lake Placid, NY). Antiphospho-ERK antibodies were from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA). Enhanced chemiluminescence detection kits were from Amersham Biosciences (Piscataway, NJ). Cell Culture—The colonic epithelial cell line, T84, was cultured in tissue culture dishes in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/Hams' F-12 medium (1:1) (JRH, Lenexa, KS) supplemented with 5% newborn calf serum (HyClone, Logan, UT). HT-29 (clone 19A) colonic epithelial cells were cultured in McCoy's 5A medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. Cells were cultured in an atmosphere of 95% O2/5% CO2 at 37 °C with medium changes every 3-4 days. For Ussing chamber/voltage clamp studies, ∼5 × 105 cells were seeded onto 12-mm Millicel-HA Transwells (Millipore, Bedford, MA). For experiments involving immunoprecipitation and Western blotting, ∼106 cells were seeded onto 30-mm Millicel-HA Transwells. Transepithelial resistance was routinely monitored using the EVOM apparatus (World Precision Instruments, Sarasota, FL), and cells seeded onto filters were cultured for 10-15 days prior to use. Under these conditions, T84 cells develop the polarized phenotype of native intestinal epithelial cells (23Dharmsathaphorn K. McRoberts J.A. Mandel K.G. Tisdale L.D. Masui H. Am. J. Physiol. 1984; 246: G204-G208Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and transepithelial resistance at the time of experimentation was typically in the range of 1000-2000 Ω.cm2. Immunoprecipitation and Western Blotting—T84 cell monolayers were washed (×3) in Ringer's solution and allowed to equilibrate for 30 min at 37 °C. Cells were then treated with agonists (with or without inhibitors) as appropriate. Incubations were stopped by washing (×2) with ice-cold PBS. Ice-cold lysis buffer (500 μl) was added (consisting of 1% Triton X-100, 1 m○ NaVO4, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, 1 μg/ml antipain, 1 m○ NaF, 1 m○ EDTA, and 100 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride in PBS), and the cells were incubated at 4 °C for 45 min. Cells were then scraped into microcentrifuge tubes and then centrifuged at 12,000 rpm for 10 min, and the pellet was discarded. An aliquot was removed from each sample to determine protein content, and samples were adjusted so that they contained equal amounts of protein. For immunoprecipitation studies, monoclonal EGFr antibody (5 μg) was added to each sample and allowed to incubate at 4 °C for 60 min, followed by addition of 40 μl of Protein A-Sepharose, and an additional overnight incubation at 4 °C. Following centrifugation, pellets were washed once with ice-cold lysis buffer, twice with ice-cold PBS, and then resuspended in gel loading buffer (50 m○ Tris, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 100 m○ dithiothreitol, 0.2% bromphenol blue, 20% glycerol). The samples were boiled for 3 min, and proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE. Separated proteins were transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) overnight at 4 °C. The membrane was washed in 1% blocking buffer for 30 min, followed by incubation of the membrane with the appropriate dilution of primary antibody in 1% blocking buffer for 60 min. This was followed by washing (5×) in Tris-buffered saline with 1% Tween (TBST). Following washes, horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (BD Transduction Laboratories, Lexington, KY) were added to the membrane in 1% blocking buffer and allowed to incubate for an additional 30 min. This was followed by further washing (5×) in TBST. Immunoreactive proteins were detected using an enhanced chemiluminescence detection kit and exposure of the membrane to x-ray film. Quantitation of protein phosphorylation was determined by densitometry using Scion image software. Measurement of Ion Transport across T84 Colonic Epithelial Cells— T84 cells were grown as monolayers on permeable filter supports as described above. After 10-15 days in culture, monolayers were mounted in Ussing chambers (aperture = 0.6 cm2), voltage-clamped to zero potential difference, and monitored for changes in Isc (ΔIsc) using a DVC-1000 Dual Voltage Clamp (World Precision Instruments, Sarasota, FL). In T84 cells it has been shown that increases in Isc are wholly reflective of increases in electrogenic Cl- secretion (24Cartwright C.A. McRoberts J.A. Mandel K.G. Dharmsathaphorn K. J. Clin. Invest. 1985; 76: 1837-1842Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Isc measurements were carried out in Ringer's solution containing (in m○): 140 Na+, 5.2 K+, 1.2 Ca2+, 0.8 Mg2+, 119.8 Cl-,25HCO3-, 2.4 H2PO42-, and 10 glucose. Results were normalized and expressed as ΔIsc (μA/cm2). Statistical Analysis—All data are expressed as mean ± S.E. for a series of n experiments. Student's t tests were used to compare paired data. One-way analysis of variance with the Student Neuman-Keuls post-test was used when three or more groups of data were compared. p values < 0.05 were considered to be statistically significant. VIP Stimulates Tyrosine Phosphorylation of the EGFr in T84 Cells—Using vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP) as a prototypical agonist, we first set out to determine if GsPCR agonists induce transactivation of the EGFr in T84 cells. Monolayers of T84 cells were stimulated with VIP (100 n○) for various times (0.5-30 min) before lysis. At this concentration VIP is known to maximally induce epithelial secretory responses (25Dharmsathaphorn K. Mandel K.G. Masui H. McRoberts J.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1985; 75: 462-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Cell lysates were then immunoprecipitated with anti-EGFr antibodies, and immunoprecipitates were Western-blotted with antiphosphotyrosine. As shown in Fig. 1, basolateral addition of VIP stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of the EGFr in a time-dependent fashion. The effects of VIP were rapid in onset with maximal EGFr phosphorylation occurring within 0.5 min after addition of the peptide. A less prominent effect of VIP on EGFr phosphorylation was observed after ∼15 min, but this did not achieve statistical significance. Fig. 1B, which depicts densitometric analysis of the time course over which VIP stimulates EGFr phosphorylation in comparison to that of its effects on Cl- secretion, shows that peak EGFr phosphorylation occurs prior to the onset of VIP-stimulated secretory responses. VIP Stimulates EGFr Phosphorylation through Elevations in Intracellular cAMP and Activation of Protein Kinase A—In intestinal epithelial cells VIP is known to exert its prosecretory effects by elevating intracellular levels of cAMP and activation of protein kinase A (PKA). We were therefore interested in determining if the effects of VIP on EGFr phosphorylation were also mediated by this signaling pathway. We found that, similar to VIP, a cell-permeant analog of cAMP, Bt2cAMP/AM (3 μ○), also stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of the EGFr (Fig. 2A). At this concentration Bt2cAMP/AM is maximally effective in stimulating Cl- secretory responses (26Schultz C. Vajanaphanich M. Genieser H.G. Jarstorff B. Barrett K.E. Tsien R.Y. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 46: 702-708PubMed Google Scholar). The kinetics of EGFr phosphorylation in response to Bt2cAMP/AM were similar to those of VIP, with a maximal response occurring within 0.5 min after addition of the agonist. Further experiments were carried out to examine the role for PKA in mediating VIP-stimulated EGFr phosphorylation. In these experiments cells were pretreated with H-89 (10 μ○), a specific inhibitor of PKA, before stimulation with Bt2cAMP/AM (3 μ○). We found that in H-89-pretreated cells, the ability of Bt2cAMP/AM to stimulate EGFr phosphorylation was significantly diminished. H-89 did not alter EGFr phosphorylation in response to EGF (100 ng/ml) itself (Fig. 2, C and D). Inhibition of the EGFr Attenuates cAMP-dependent Chloride Secretion in Colonic Epithelial Cells—Next, to determine if transactivation of the EGFr plays a role in regulation of cAMP-dependent Cl- secretion, we examined the effects of an EGFr inhibitor, tyrphostin AG1478, on Isc responses to Bt2cAMP/AM across voltage-clamped monolayers of T84 cells. Pretreatment of T84 cells with tyrphostin AG1478 (1 μ○), which reduced Bt2cAMP/AM-stimulated EGFr phosphorylation by 78.5 ± 8.7% (n = 3; p < 0.01) (Fig. 3A), significantly attenuated subsequent Isc responses to Bt2cAMP/AM (3 μ○) (Fig. 3B). Control responses to Bt2cAMP/AM were 40.8 ± 5.5 μA/cm2 compared with 21.3 ± 4.5 μA/cm2 in tyrphostin-pretreated cells (n = 6; p < 0.01). In similar experiments secretory responses to VIP in T84 cells were also attenuated, albeit to a lesser extent, by tyrphostin AG1478 (1 μ○). Control responses to VIP were 51.3 ± 7.3 μA/cm2 compared with 43.2 ± 6.5 μA/cm2 in tyrphostin AG1478-pretreated cells (n = 6; p < 0.01). To confirm these findings we examined the effects of another inhibitor of the EGFr, PD 153035, on Isc responses to VIP. In this case, responses to VIP in PD 153035 (1 μ○)-pretreated cells were 34.3 ± 4.3 μA/cm2 compared with 46.3 ± 5.1 μA/cm2 in control cells (n = 10; p < 0.01). cAMP-dependent Agonists Stimulate ERK MAPK Phosphorylation in T84 Cells via Transactivation of the EGFr—Because we have previously shown that transactivation of the EGFr in response to GqPCR agonists leads to subsequent activation of the ERK isoforms of MAPK, we next set out to determine if ERK may also be activated as a consequence of GsPCR-induced EGFr transactivation. We found that stimulation of cells with basolateral VIP (100 n○) resulted in phosphorylation of both the 42- and 44-kDa isoforms of ERK (Fig. 4, A and C). The kinetics of VIP-stimulated ERK phosphorylation lagged some-what behind those of VIP-stimulated EGFr phosphorylation with significant phosphorylation of ERK not being observed until 5-15 min after addition of the peptide (compare with Fig. 2). Similarly, Bt2cAMP/AM (3 μ○) also stimulated phosphorylation of ERK MAPK. In this case, ERK phosphorylation was maximal 5 min after the addition of agonist (Fig. 4, B and C). Furthermore, we found that when cells were pretreated with the EGFr inhibitor, tyrphostin AG1478 (1 μ○), Bt2cAMP/AM-stimulated ERK phosphorylation was reduced by 73.7 ± 10.5%, (n = 5, p < 0.001) indicating this response is likely due to activation of the EGFr (Fig. 4D). cAMP-dependent Agonists Stimulate Recruitment of the p85 Subunit of PI3K to the EGFr—Because, similar to ERK, PI3K has also been implicated in mediating the downstream effects of EGFr activation in a variety of cell types, we also examined the possibility that activation of the EGFr in response to cAMP-dependent agonists in T84 cells may also lead to PI3K activation. Treatment of T84 cells with basolateral VIP (100 n○) resulted in recruitment of the p85 subunit of PI3K to the EGFr (Fig. 5, A and C). The kinetics with which VIP stimulated p85 recruitment to the EGFr closely followed those for VIP-stimulated EGFr phosphorylation (compare with Fig. 2) with a peak response occurring 1 min after addition of the agonist. VIP-stimulated recruitment of the p85 subunit of PI3K was accompanied by phosphorylation of a downstream substrate of PI3K, AKT. After 1 min stimulation with VIP, AKT phosphorylation was increased 3.6 ± 0.3-fold over control, unstimulated cells (n = 5; p < 0.01). This effect was blocked by the PI3K inhibitor, LY 290042 (20 μ○) (data not shown). Further experiments revealed that Bt2cAMP/AM (3 μ○) also stimulated p85 recruitment to the EGFr (Fig. 5, B and C). Similar to its effects on ERK phosphorylation, pretreatment of T84 cells with tyrphostin AG1478 (1 μ○) inhibited Bt2cAMP/AM-stimulated p85 recruitment to the EGFr, implying this response is mediated by activation of the EGFr (Fig. 5D). Inhibition of PI3K, but Not ERK, Attenuates cAMP-dependent Cl- Secretion in T84 Cells—Finally, we examined a possible role for ERK and PI3K in regulation of cAMP-dependent epithelial Cl- secretion. First we examined the effects of the ERK inhibitor, PD 98059, on Isc responses to Bt2cAMP/AM across voltage-clamped monolayers of T84 cells. As shown in the inset to Fig. 6A, PD 98059 (20 μ○) inhibited ERK phosphorylation in response to Bt2cAMP/AM (3 μ○) by 63.7 ± 9.2% (n = 5, p < 0.01). However, pretreatment of voltage-clamped T84 cells with PD 98059 did not alter subsequent Isc responses to Bt2cAMP/AM (Fig. 6A) or to VIP (data not shown). In contrast, pretreatment of voltage-clamped T84 cells with the PI3K inhibitor, wortmannin (50 n○), significantly reduced subsequent Isc responses to Bt2cAMP/AM (3 μ○) (Fig. 6B). Maximal responses to Bt2cAMP/AM were 41.7 ± 6.7 μA/cm2 in controls and 15.7 ± 2.6 μA/cm2 in cells pretreated with wortmannin (n = 5, p < 0.01). Wortmannin (50 n○) also reduced Isc responses to VIP. Responses to VIP in control cells were 51.0 ± 3.6 μA/cm2 compared with 41.1 ± 1.3 μA/cm2 in wortmannin-pretreated cells (n = 5; p < 0.01). In addition, secretory responses to VIP, Bt2cAMP/AM, and the adenylate cyclase activator, forskolin (FSK) were also attenuated by another inhibitor of PI3K, LY 290042. Responses to VIP (100 n○), Bt2cAMP/AM (3 μ○), and FSK (10 μ○), in the presence of LY 290042 (20 μ○), were 75.2 ± 5.6% (n = 5; p < 0.05), 65.1 ± 5.1% (n = 11; p < 0.001), and 79.6 ± 5.3% (n = 12; p < 0.01) of those in control cells, respectively. Finally, to confirm the role of PI3K in regulating cAMP-dependent intestinal Cl- secretion, we also analyzed the effects of LY 290042 on Isc responses to FSK in another colonic epithelial cell line, HT-29 (clone 19A) cells. Similar to its effects in T84 cells, LY 290042 reduced responses to FSK in HT-29 cells. Responses to FSK in control cells were 74.5 ± 8.8 μA/cm2 compared with 55.8 ± 12.1 μA/cm2 in LY 290042-pretreated cells (n = 4; p < 0.05). Together, these data imply that PI3K, but not ERK, is involved in mediating the full expression of cAMP-dependent Cl- secretory responses in T84 cells. It is becoming increasingly apparent that, in addition to its classic role as a growth factor receptor, the EGFr also serves as an important signaling intermediate in regulation of cellular responses induced by GPCR agonists in epithelial cells. Although our previous studies have shown that recruitment of the EGFr by GqPCR agonists serves as an inhibitory mechanism to limit the extent and duration of secretory responses to such agonists (3Keely S.J. Uribe J.M. Barrett K.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27111-27117Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar), in the present study we present data that are consistent with a contrasting role for the EGFr in mediating the full expression of GsPCR-stimulated Cl- secretion. First, we found that treatment of intestinal epithelial cells with VIP rapidly stimulates tyrosine phosphorylation of the EGFr. Because it has been shown that both epithelial receptors for VIP are coupled to Gs proteins, stimulation of adenylate cyclase, and production of cAMP (27Ulrich C.D. Holtmann M. Miller L.J. Gastroenterology. 1998; 114: 382-397Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar), we examined if elevations in intracellular cAMP alone were sufficient to stimulate phosphorylation of the EGFr. We found that a cell-permeant analog of cAMP, Bt2cAMP/AM, which stimulates qualitatively similar Cl- secretory responses to VIP, also mimicked the effects of the peptide on EGFr phosphorylation, implying these effects are mediated by elevations in intracellular cAMP. Furthermore, the observation that cAMP-induced phosphorylation of the EGFr is attenuated by the PKA inhibitor, H-89, suggests that PKA is also likely to be a component of the signaling pathway linking GsPCRs to the EGFr. In other systems where EGFr transactivation has been demonstrated to occur in response to cAMP-dependent agonists, PKA has also been implicated in this process (18Maudsley S. Pierce K.L. Zamah A.M.

Indeed, in COS-7 cells, it has been proposed that β2-adrenergic agonists stimulate phosphorylation of the EGFr by an indirect mechanism involving a PKA-induced switch of coupling by the normally Gs protein-coupled β2-adrenoreceptor to a Gi protein. This brings about activation of Src family kinases, which, in turn, activate the EGFr (18Maudsley S. Pierce K.L. Zamah A.M. Miller W.E. Ahn S. Daaka Y. Lefkowitz R.J. Luttrell L.M. J. Biol.

Whether such a mechanism underlies the effects of GsPCR-induced transactivation of the EGFr in intestinal epithelial cells is currently under investigation. Similarly, whether matrix metalloproteinases and extracellular shedding of EGFr ligands are involved in mediating GsPCR-induced EGFr transactivation, as they in mediating transactivation of the EGFr in response to GqPCR agonists (7Gschwind A.

https://openalex.org/W2011462118,"Astrocytes regulate the integrity of the blood-brain barrier and influence inflammatory processes in the central nervous system. The pro-inflammatory chemokine monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), which is both released by and stimulates astrocytes, is thought to play a crucial role in both these activities. Because astrocytes have been shown to possess caveolae, vesicular structures that participate in intracellular transport and signal transduction events, we reasoned that expression of the major structural protein of these organelles, caveolin-1, might feature critically in the cellular responses to MCP-1. To test this hypothesis, caveolin-1 level was “knocked down” in human astrocyte cultures by using a small interfering RNA approach. This method resulted in efficient (>90% loss) and specific knockdown of caveolin-1 expression while sparring glial fibrillary acidic protein as well as several other proteins involved in endocytosis. Astrocytes suffering caveolin-1 loss showed diminished ability to down-modulate and internalize the MCP-1 receptor (CCR2) in response to exposure to this chemokine and also demonstrated significantly reduced capacity to undergo chemotaxis and calcium flux when MCP-1-stimulated. The results highlight a potentially prominent role for caveolae and/or caveolin-1 in mediating astrocyte responses to MCP-1, a feature that might significantly dictate the progression of inflammatory events at the blood-brain barrier.

Once considered largely the province of the immune system, the chemokine network, which is largely responsible for directing the migration of leukocytes out of the vasculature and into tissue recesses, is now generally recognized to also have a functional foothold in the central nervous system. Indeed, a panoply of chemokines and their cognate receptors is expressed within the central nervous system by all the parenchymal cell types (1Bajetto A. Bonavia R. Barbero S. Schettini G. J.

Astrocytes, in particular, have garnered significant attention as the major central nervous system sources of chemokines in a variety of neuropathological states associated with inflammation, e.g. demyelinating diseases, viral encephalotides, ischemia, and trauma (4Ranssohoff R.M.

Neurosci. 1999; 22: 11-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (845) Google Scholar), it may be logically construed that the release of chemokines by these cells is pivotal to the location and scope of central nervous system inflammatory processes (12Huang D.

This laboratory first described the existence of saturable, high affinity binding sites for MCP-1 on cultured human astrocytes and supported this finding by immunocytochemical detection of CCR2, the major recognized receptor for this chemokine (23Andjelkovic A.V. Kerkovich D. Shanley J. Pulliam L. Pachter J.S. Glia. 1999; 28: 225-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar).

Neuroimmunol. 2002; 128: 49-57Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) sources. Most recently we have extended our findings to demonstrate that the CCR2 expressed by astrocytes is a functional receptor whose engagement by MCP-1 leads to receptor internalization and down-modulation from the cell surface as well as chemotaxis and calcium flux by these cells (24Andjelkovic A.V. Song L. Dzenko K.A. Cong H. Pachter J.S. J. Neurosci. Res. 2002; 70: 219-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Because these responses are typical of the repertoire displayed by both leukocytes and other CCR2-bearing cells after MCP-1 stimulation, it may be concluded that the CCR2 expressed by astrocytes is, in fact, bona fide in nature. Somewhat surprisingly, astrocyte internalization of MCP-1/CCR2 was determined to occur at least partly via caveolae, flask-shaped membrane invaginations considered to possibly represent a specialized type of lipid raft (31Kensworthy A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2002; 27: 435-437Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 32Lai E.C. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 162: 365-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). To gauge caveolae participation, these organelles were disrupted by treatment with the cholesterol sequestering agent filipin, which prevented MCP-1-induced, down-modulation of cell-surface CCR2 expression. This observation of possible caveolae involvement differs from those noted by others, who described chemokine-induced receptor internalization to be achieved by the more commonly acknowledged clathrincoated pit pathway (33Aramori I. Zhang J. Ferguson S.S. Bieniasz P.D. Cullen B.R. Caron M.G. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4606-4616Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar, 34Solari R. Offord R.E. Remy S. Aubry J.-P. Wells T.N.C.

Chem. 1999; 274: 111328-111333Google Scholar). Insofar as caveolae and their main structural protein, caveolin-1, both of which are expressed by astrocytes (36Teixeira A. Chaverot N. Schroder C. Strosberg A.D. Couraud P.O. Cazaubon S. J. Neurochem. 1999; 72: 120-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 37Megias L. Guerri C. Fornas E. Azorin I. Bendala E. Sancho-Tello M. Durna J.M. Tomas M. Gomez-Lechon M.J. Renaus-Piqueras J. Int. J. Dev. Biol. 2000; 44: 209-221PubMed Google Scholar), have been implicated in regulating signal transduction events as well as subserving endocytosis and transcytosis (38Couet J. Belanger M.M. Roussel E. Drolet M.C. Adv. Drug Deliv. Rev. 2001; 49: 223-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), caveolin-1-bearing membrane domains may be critical in mediating one or more of the responses of astrocytes to stimulation by MCP-1. To test this possibility and mindful of the prospect that filipin could potentially exert broad-ranging effects unrelated to caveolae, we chose to use a small interfering RNA (siRNA) approach to transiently and specifically knockdown expression of caveolin-1 in cultured, human astrocytes. Findings indicate that ablation of caveolin-1 expression results in significantly diminished ability of MCP-1 to induce down-modulation of MCP-1 surface binding as well as promote chemotaxis and calcium flux in these cells. These observations suggest that caveolae and/or caveolin-1 might have a considerably broader role in chemokine activities than previously anticipated. Reagents and Chemicals—All reagents were purchased from Sigma unless specified otherwise. Primary Human Astrocyte Culture—Human fetal astrocytes were derived brain tissue obtained from second-trimester aborted fetuses, the gestational ages of which ranged from 19 to 22 weeks. Informed consent was obtained from all participants who, at the time of elective termination of pregnancy, indicated no risk factors for human immunodeficiency virus-1 infection. Astrocytes cultures were prepared as previously described (24Andjelkovic A.V. Song L. Dzenko K.A. Cong H. Pachter J.S. J. Neurosci. Res. 2002; 70: 219-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Briefly, cerebral tissue was thoroughly washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), separated from meninges, and minced into small blocks. The minced tissue was then incubated in Hanks' balanced salt solution (HBSS; Invitrogen) containing 0.25% trypsin and 40 μg/ml DNase I and gently shaken at 37 °C for 30 min. During and after enzyme treatment the tissue was mildly triturated to produce a single cell suspension, and the dissociated cells were plated at a density of 2 × 107 in 12 ml in T75 flasks. Cultures were maintained up to 2 weeks in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM; Invitrogen) containing 10% fetal calf serum with 1% antibiotic/antimycotic (Invitrogen) in a humidified atmosphere (5% CO2) at 37 °C. Then cultures were shaken at 200 rpm for 2 h at 4 °C to dislodge weakly adherent microglia. Cultures were then shaken for an additional 18 h at 37 °C to remove the neuronal population. The remaining enriched astrocyte population was further purified by trypsinization and replating. Cell purity was determined by immunocytochemistry using a monoclonal anti-human glial fibrillary acid protein (GFAP, Sigma) antibody, and cultures were assessed to ∼99% astrocytes (GFAP-positive). Culture medium was changed twice a week. Estimation of Caveolin-1 Protein Half-life—Astrocytes (1× 105) were seeded onto 12-well tissue culture plates (BD Biosciences). After 24 h the cells were incubated with 10 μg/ml cycloheximide for 0, 1, 3, 6, 12, 18, and 24 h. After these respective times, astrocytes were harvested and lysed with radioimmune precipitation lysis buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 0.14 m NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1% deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, and protease inhibitors (20 μg/ml aprotinin, 20 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). To account for the effects of cycloheximide on cell growth, astrocytes plated in parallel wells were counted, and volumes of cell extracts containing approximately equal numbers of cells were separated by 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and subject to Western blotting with antibody to caveolin-1. Caveolin-1 T7 siRNA Synthesis—T7 siRNA was designed according to the methods described by Donze and Didear (39Donze O. Didear P. Nucleic Acid Res. 2002; 30: 46-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). The sequence (GATCGACCTGGTCAACCGC) was selected as the target region and corresponds to nucleotides 422–440 uniquely present in the human caveolin-1 coding region (GenBank™ accession number NM 001753). To generate the siRNA, the following DNA oligonucleotides were synthesized by Invitrogen: 5′-TAATACGACTCACTATAG-3′ (T7 promoter); 5′-TCGCGGTTGACCAGGTCGATCTATAGTGAGTCGTATTA-3′ (sense); 5′-GAGATCGACCTGGTCAACCGCTATAGTGAGTCGTATTA-3′ (antisense). The same nucleotides used to generate the siRNA probe were used in scrambled sequence to generate a disordered siRNA (dsiRNA). This served as a control for nonspecific effects due to transfection of duplex RNA. Specifically, the sequences of the control oligonucleotides employed were 5′-CTGGGGGGGTTTTACCACCACTATAGTGAGTCGTATTA-3′ (sense) and 5′-TCGTGGTGGTAAAACCCCCCCTATAGTGAGTCGTATTA-3′ (antisense). For in vitro transcription 38-nucleotide DNA template oligonucleotides were designed to produce 19-nucleotide siRNA, utilizing T7 RNA polymerase as described (39Donze O. Didear P. Nucleic Acid Res. 2002; 30: 46-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar, 40Yu J.-Y. DeRuzter S.L. Turner D.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 6047-6052Crossref PubMed Scopus (958) Google Scholar, 41Milligan J.F. Uhlenbeck O.C. Methods Enzymol. 1989; 180: 51-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (1017) Google Scholar). Briefly, one nmol of T7 promoter and sense or antisense oligonucleotides were mixed and annealed in 50 μlof TE buffer (10 mm Tris-HCI, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA) at 95 °C for 5 min, then cooled slowly to room temperature. In vitro transcription was performed using the AmpliScribe™ T7 High Yield transcription kit (Epicenter Technologies, Madison, WI). One μg of annealed DNA template was incubated in a 20 μl of transcription reaction overnight at 37 °C. After that, 1 unit of RNase free-DNase I (Epicenter Technologies) was added at 37 °C for 15 min. For generation of siRNA duplexes, sense and antisense siRNA strands were mixed and heated at 95 °C for 5 min, then cooled slowly to room temperature. The duplex siRNA was further purified by ethanol precipitation. After centrifugation, the resulting pellet was rinsed with 70% ethanol, air-dried, resuspended in RNase-free water, and stored at –20 °C. The concentration of siRNA was estimated by ethidium staining. Transfection of siRNA—Astrocytes were seeded onto 6-well tissue culture plates at 60–80% confluency and in the absence of antibiotic ∼18 h before transfection. Just before the transfection protocol, culture medium was removed, and the cells were washed once with PBS and then transfected with siRNA (0.2 μg/well) using Oligofectamine (2 μg/well) in Opti-MEM I medium (both from Invitrogen). After 4 h an equal volume fresh media containing 20% serum was added. A second transfection was performed 24 h after the initial transfection, following an identical protocol. After an additional period of 24 h (i.e. 48 h after the first transfection) cells were utilized for analysis or experimentation. Immunocytochemistry—For immunocytochemical verification of caveolin-1 knockdown, astrocytes (2 × 104) were plated on poly-lysine-coated Falcon Culture Slides (BD Biosciences). After allowing 24 h for adherence/growth, cells were transfected with siRNA as described above. After the transfection protocol astrocytes were fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde in PBS for 20 min at room temperature and then incubated in blocking buffer (HBSS containing 5% goat normal serum and 0.2% Tween 20) at 4 °C overnight to reduce nonspecific antibody binding. To detect phosphorylated caveolin-1, astrocytes were plated and processed in the same manner but were not subjected to transfection. After the blocking step cells were incubated with either rabbit polyclonal anti-caveolin-1 (1:2000 dilution; Transduction Laboratories, San Diego, CA), mouse monoclonal phospho-caveolin-1 (Tyr-14) antibody (1:100 dilution; Transduction Laboratories), mouse monoclonal anti-GFAP (1:200 dilution; Sigma), or mouse monoclonal anti-clathrin (1:200 dilution; Transduction Laboratories). Next, cells were washed with PBS followed by incubation with the following, respective secondary antibodies, each at 1:200 dilution for 1 h at room temperature: fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Vector Labs, Burlingame, CA); rhodamine-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Roche Applied Science); 7-amino-4-methylcoumarin-3-acetic acid-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). All primary and secondary antibodies were diluted in blocking buffer. After staining with secondary antibodies, samples were washed again with PBS and then mounted in Vectashield mounting medium (Vector Laboratories). Controls for the immunostaining procedure were prepared similarly but with the omission of primary antibody. Samples were viewed and photographed under an Olympus IX70 microscope (20×/0.40 NA objective, Olympus America Inc., Melville, NY) equipped with epifluorescence optics and a Hammamatsu ORCA-ER camera. Western Blot Analysis—Astrocytes were washed with cold PBS and then scraped into lysis buffer containing 10 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 0.14 m NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1% deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, and protease inhibitors (20 μg/ml aprotinin, 20 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and placed on ice for 10 min. The cell extracts were homogenized with 10 strokes in a Dounce glass homogenizer and then clarified by centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C. Extract protein concentration was determined by MicroBCA protein assay (Pierce), and for assessment of both the efficiency/specificity of caveolin-1 knockdown and extent of caveolin-1 phosphorylation equal amounts of protein were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by transfer onto nitrocellulose membranes (Bio-Rad). The following percentages of acrylamide were used for resolution of the respective proteins: 6% (clathrin and EEA1), 7.5% (adaptins-α and -β), 10% (GFAP and flotillins 1 and 2), or 12% (caveolin-1, phospho-caveolin-1). Nonspecific protein binding was blocked by the incubation of the membranes in 5% nonfat milk (Bio-Rad). Immunodetection was performed with primary antibodies to GFAP (1:1000 dilution, Sigma), caveolin-1 (1:10,000 dilution, Transduction Laboratories), flotillin-1 and -2 (1:5000 dilution, Transduction Laboratories), clathrin, adaptins-α and -β, and EEA1 (all at 1:1000 dilution and all from Transduction Laboratories), and anti-rabbit or anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (1:10,000 dilution; Cappel, Aurora, Ohio). Blots were developed with an enhanced chemiluminescence kit (SuperSignal West Femto Maximum Sensitivity; Pierce) according to the manufacturer's instructions. A digitized image of each blot film was obtained using a flatbed scanner. Relative quantification of proteins was performed by determining the mean pixel intensity associated with individual bands (of constant pixel size) on scanned autoradiographs using Adobe PhotoShop 6.0 software. To obtain a mean pixel intensity value corresponding solely to specific protein immunoreactivity, a background noise value (of pixel size equal to that used to outline protein bands and selected from an irrelevant area of the autoradiograph) was subtracted from each protein value. Corrected mean pixel intensity values were typically graphed as relative protein amount along the ordinate, except in the case of caveolin-1 t½ determination, where values were expressed as percent caveolin-1 immunoreactivity present at time 0. Measurement of Calcium Flux—Measurement of calcium flux was performed as previously detailed (24Andjelkovic A.V. Song L. Dzenko K.A. Cong H. Pachter J.S. J. Neurosci. Res. 2002; 70: 219-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). In short, astrocytes were plated on Delta T dishes (0.15-mm thickness, black-slide; Bioptechs Inc., Butler, PA) and transfected with siRNA as described above. At 24 h after the double transfection the cells were loaded with 2 μm Fura Red and 2 μm Flou-3 (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) in loading buffer (HBSS with 0.1% bovine serum albumin, 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4) and incubated at 37 °C in 5% CO2 for 45 min. After this period the cells were washed twice and incubated in a fresh loading buffer for another 30 min at 37 °C. Scanning confocal imaging was performed with a Zeiss LSM 510 confocal microscope (Zeiss, Jena, Germany) and 63×/1.25 NA oil objective after adding recombinant human (rh) MCP-1 (Peprotech Inc, Rocky Hill, NJ) directly to the cells. Samples were excited with an argon laser at 488 nm, and the emitted fluorescence was detected with green (Fluo-3, 515 nm) or red (Fura Red, 610 nm) filters. Ratiometric images were obtained using MetaMorph version 4.6 software (Universal Imaging Corp., Downington, PA). Chemotaxis Assay—Cell migration was performed using 96-well microchemotaxis filter chambers (pore size, 12 μm; Neuro Probe, Inc. Bethesda, MA) that were coated with 50 μg/ml poly-lysine and air-dried before experimentation. Astrocytes transfected with siRNA were trypsinized, washed, and allowed to recover surface protein expression by incubation in DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum for 90 min at 37 °C in 5% CO2. After that cells were washed twice with PBS and resuspended in serum-free DMEM containing 1% bovine serum albumin, and 50 μl of suspension (2 × 105 cells) was added to the upper well of the chemotaxis chamber. A volume of 30 μl containing varied concentrations of rhMCP-1 was placed in the lower chamber to induce chemotaxis, and the entire chemotaxis chamber was placed for 12 h at 37 °C in 5% CO2. After chemotaxis was complete the upper surface of the filter was thoroughly swiped with a cotton swab to remove the surface-bound, nonmigrating cells. This swiping process is critical to accurately resolve and quantify those cells that have actually migrated into the filter from ones only adherent to the filter surface. After swiping filters were fixed and stained with Diff-Quick (Dade Diagnostics, Aguada, PR), and the number of migrating cells was counted under a light microscope at 40× magnification. A chemotactic index for each condition was calculated as number of cells migrating in response to MCP-1/number of cells migrating in the absence of MCP-1. MCP-1 Binding Assay—MCP-1 binding to astrocytes was performed essentially as described previously (23Andjelkovic A.V. Kerkovich D. Shanley J. Pulliam L. Pachter J.S. Glia. 1999; 28: 225-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 24Andjelkovic A.V. Song L. Dzenko K.A. Cong H. Pachter J.S. J. Neurosci.

Briefly, cells were first reacted with biotinylated-rhMCP-1; MCP-1 Fluorokine kit, R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) at 50 nm for 1 h at 4 °C. The cells were incubated with fluorescein-conjugated avidin (R&D Systems) for an additional 30 min at 4 °C. All samples were viewed with a Zeiss LSM 510 microscope using an Fluar 40×/1.3 NA oil objective, and images obtained were processed with Adobe PhotoShop 6.0. Quantification of MCP-1 binding was accomplished in the manner previously detailed (23Andjelkovic A.V. Kerkovich D. Shanley J. Pulliam L. Pachter J.S. Glia. 1999; 28: 225-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 24Andjelkovic A.V. Song L. Dzenko K.A. Cong H. Pachter J.S. J. Neurosci. Res. 2002; 70: 219-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). In short, we recorded mean pixel intensity values from a total of 10 randomly chosen areas (512 × 512 pixels) containing at least 10 cells each that were generated from triplicate samples for each condition assayed. Mean pixel intensity values were obtained using Adobe PhotoShop 6.0 and averaged for the respective conditions. To obtain values specifically due to MCP-1 binding background noise was negated from each sample by subtracting fluorescence values obtained using an irrelevant protein, biotinylated soybean trypsin inhibitor (negative control), in place of labeled MCP-1. During this procedure constant conditions of aperture, pinhole, detector gain, amplitude offset, amplitude gain, brightness, and contrast were maintained. The adjusted mean pixel intensities were graphed as relative MCP-1 binding ±S.E. Down-modulation of MCP-1 Binding Sites—Astrocytes (±siRNA treatment) were preincubated with 50 nm unlabeled rhMCP-1 at 37 °C for 2 h, conditions previously determined to enable CCR2 receptor internalization (24Andjelkovic A.V. Song L. Dzenko K.A. Cong H. Pachter J.S. J. Neurosci. Res. 2002; 70: 219-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Subsequently, cells were washed several times with HBSS to remove the unbound, unlabeled chemokine and then subject to the biot-rhMCP-1 binding assay at 4 °C. Phosphorylation of Caveolin-1—Astrocytes (1 × 105) were seeded in growth media onto 12-well plates. After attachment overnight cells were serum-starved for 12 h and then preincubated with 100 μg/ml orthovanadate in serum-free DMEM for 20 min. After this treatment, astrocytes were rinsed with DMEM and incubated with MCP-1 (10 nm) for 10 min in serum-free DMEM. Cells were then either harvested in radioimmune precipitation lysis buffer for Western blotting or fixed for immunocytochemistry. Statistics—Differences in protein expression and biologic activity between control astrocytes and those subject to siRNA-mediated caveolin-1 knockdown were assessed by Student's t test. p < 0.05 was considered significant. To first gauge the possible sensitivity of astrocytes to caveolin-1 knockdown by siRNA, a rough approximation of the half-life (t½) of this protein was determined. The rationale for such determination was that, if caveolin-1 ha"

The human Spt16 and SSRP1 proteins constitute an abundant, nuclear, and heterodimeric complex called FACT. FACT was initially discovered as a chromatin-specific elongation factor that facilitates transcription of chromatin templates in vitro (1Orphanides G. LeRoy G. Chang C.H. Luse D.S. Reinberg D. Cell. 1998; 92: 105-116Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar, 2LeRoy G. Orphanides G. Lane W.S. Reinberg D. Science. 1998; 282: 1900-1904Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). The exact mechanism by which FACT aids the movement of RNA polymerase II along nucleosomal DNA is not known. By interacting with histone H2A/H2B dimers, FACT has been postulated to render intranucleosomal histone connections more flexible (3Orphanides G. Wu W.H. Lane W.S. Hampsey M. Reinberg D. Nature. 1999; 400: 284-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar). The genes that encode these two FACT polypeptides and, more significantly, the existence of such stable heterodimeric factors are highly conserved among eukaryotes. Homologous heterodimers have been purified and identified from yeast and frog cells. The Xenopus DNA unwinding factor (DUF) 1The abbreviations used are: DUF, DNA unwinding factor; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; DAPI, 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole; BrdUrd, bromodeoxyuridine; ds, double-stranded; FACS, fluorescence-activated cell sorting; mAb, monoclonal antibody.1The abbreviations used are: DUF, DNA unwinding factor; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; DAPI, 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole; BrdUrd, bromodeoxyuridine; ds, double-stranded; FACS, fluorescence-activated cell sorting; mAb, monoclonal antibody. complex is also composed of Spt16 and SSRP1 homologs (4Okuhara K.

Unlike the mammalian counterpart, DUF was directly implicated in DNA replication, as immunodepletion of this complex led to a reduced ability to replicate exogenously added sperm nuclei or plasmid DNA. However, its ability to alter nucleosomal DNA structure is conserved (5Seo H. Okuhara K. Kurumizaka H. Yamada T. Shibata T. Ohta K. Akiyama T. Murofushi H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 303: 8-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Studies on the corresponding Spt16-Pob3 heterodimer in yeast have provided the most extensive up-to-date evidence on the pleiotropic nature of this heterodimer as well as its role as a chromatin structure modulator.

Consistently, genetic and physical interactions were observed between Spt16-Pob3 and a myriad of transcription or replication proteins, such as transcription elongator Paf1 complex (12Squazzo S.L.

Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 8961-8971Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Collectively, this assortment of observations directly links FACT/DUF/Spt16-Pob3 to replication and transcription and, more specifically, to the structural regulation of chromatin, as such an entity serves as template for both processes. The existing evidence is consistent with the notion that FACT and homologous complexes possess a single central activity that is required for the progression of replication and transcription. However, their roles at multiple steps within these two processes may be mediated by differential coordination with various factors. The potential existence of such an interaction network is substantiated by the aforementioned group of ySpt16-Pob3-interacting proteins. Hence, to further delineate the role of human FACT in chromatin-related cellular processes, our research efforts have been focused on the identification and functional characterization of its interacting proteins. By generating monoclonal antibodies directed against SSRP1, and subsequently performing antibody affinity purification, we were able to isolate FACT-associated protein complexes from HeLa nuclear extracts. One of the polypeptides identified in such search is the Nek9 protein. Nek9 (previously termed Nek8) was originally identified as a β-casein kinase that associates with a putative substrate Bicd2 (19Holland P.M. Milne A. Garka K. Johnson R.S. Willis C. Sims J.E. Rauch C.T. Bird T.A. Virca G.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 16229-16240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). It was independently identified as a Nek6- and Ran GTPase-binding protein under a different name, Nercc1 (20Roig J. Mikhailov A. Belham C. Avruch J. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 1640-1658Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Based on kinase domain sequence similarity, Nek9 was a recent addition to the NIMA-like kinase (Nek) family, whose dozen or so members have diverse but relatively unknown functions. In addition to the N-terminal catalytic domain, Nek9 contains a central, RCC1-like, seven-repeats region, followed by a coiled-coil domain. Despite the presence of a nuclear localization signal, previous publications have reported a cytoplasmic localization of this kinase. Furthermore, Nek9 is putatively involved in the microtubule dynamics and has been implicated in the regulation of mitotic progression (20Roig J. Mikhailov A. Belham C. Avruch J. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 1640-1658Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Experimental results presented in this report confirm the presence of a nuclear form of Nek9. One of the major supporting factors is the in vivo interaction between Nek9 and FACT, the characterization of which was done using biochemical and immunocytochemical methods. A better mechanistic understanding of Nek9 was achieved by the discovery that the activation loop residue Thr210 was phosphorylated by in vitro autoactivation of Nek9. We also demonstrated the novel existence of an endogenous phospho-Nek9-FACT complex, whose formation seems to rise during interphase. Interestingly, cells stably harboring the Nek9-targeting small interfering RNA exhibited markedly slower progression of G1 and S phases. Thus, our data collectively suggest that Nek9, by virtue of forming an active kinase complex with FACT, may be involved in FACT-mediated functional pathways, the compromise of which would ultimately lead to impeded interphase progression. Molecular Cloning of the Nek9 cDNA—cDNA library was synthesized from poly(A)+ RNA of HeLa cells. The complete open reading frame containing cDNAs were obtained from this library by PCR using LA Taq DNA polymerase (Takara) with synthetic primers 5′-CCGCCATGTCGGTGCTGGGCGAGTACGA-3′ (nek9-forward) and 5′-TGGGAACAGACTCCTGTAGACCCAGCCTC-3′ (nek9-reverse, without the stop codon). The ∼3-kbp fragment was subsequently subcloned into TOPO-TA plasmid (PCR II, Invitrogen) for sequence verification and further cloning. C-terminally FLAG-tagged Nek9 was produced by inserting a NotI-SalI fragment from the above Nek9-TA plasmid into the pCMV-Tag4A mammalian expression vector (Stratagene). C-terminal FLAG-tagged Nek9 was also subcloned into a baculovirus expression vector pVL1393 (Pharmingen). For bacterial expression of recombinant Nek9, two partial coding sequences (NotI-EcoRI and BamHI-EcoRI corresponding to amino acids 1–266 and 291–559, respectively) were ligated to pET-32 prokaryotic expression plasmid (Novagen). Preparation of Recombinant Proteins and Antibodies—The expression plasmids pVL-Nek9-FLAG, pVL-Nek9-Myc, pVL-His6-SSRP1, and pVL-FLAG-FACT140 were introduced into Sf9 insect cells using a BaculoGold transfection kit (Pharmingen). The recombinant baculoviruses were produced and harvested according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The Nek9-FLAG protein was purified by anti-FLAG (M2) immunoaffinity column and eluted with synthetic FLAG peptide (0.5 mg/ml). His-tagged Nek9s (amino acids 1–266 and 291–559), His-SSRP1, and His-FACT140 were expressed in BL21 (Lys) cells and purified from the clarified lysates on nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Monoclonal antibodies against SSRP1 (2B12, 3E4, 7F8, and 10D1) and FACT140 (8D2) were produced in mice using the respective recombinant proteins. Anti-Nek9 rabbit antisera, termed αNek9-N and αNek9-M, were raised by independent injections with His-Nek9-(1–266) and His-Nek9-(291–559), respectively, and subsequently affinity-purified through Nek9-FLAG column. Antisera against phosphorylated Nek9 activation loop peptide were generated in rabbits using keyhole limpet hemocyanin-conjugated phosphorylated peptides (Nek9-(206–216), SMAET* LVGTPY, phosphorylated at Thr-210). The antisera from immunized rabbits were affinity-purified successively with bacterial His-Nek9-conjugated and -phosphorylated peptide columns. Both anti-Nek9 and Thr210-Nek9 phospho-specific rabbit antibodies were produced by Dagene (Taiwan). Immunoprecipitation and Western Blot Analysis—Cells were rinsed with PBS. Whole cell extracts were obtained using a buffer containing 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 0.2 m NaCl, 0.5% Triton X-100, 5% glycerol, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 10 mm β-glycerophosphate, 2 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm NaF, 1 mm dithiothreitol, plus protease inhibitors. Protein concentration was determined by the Bradford reagent (Bio-Rad). Immunoprecipitations were done with the indicated antibodies prebound to protein G-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) and washed in the cell lysis buffer containing 0.3 m NaCl. Similar conditions apply to the in vitro pull-down assay, in which lysates of Nek9-Myc were independently incubated with M2 (Sigma) and nickel (nickel-nitrilotriacetic acidagarose, Qiagen)-agarose beads pre-bound with FLAG-FACT140 and His6-SSRP1, respectively. Western blot analysis was performed after electrophoretic separation of polypeptides by 7.5 or 10% SDS-PAGE and transfer to Hybond-C membranes. Blots were probed with the indicated primary and appropriate secondary antibodies and detected by ECL chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences). Band signals on x-ray films were quantitatively analyzed by a Fujifilm Luminescent Image Analyzer LAS-1000plus and the software Image Gauge. Gel Filtration Fractionation—HeLa nuclei were isolated and lysed in nuclear extraction buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 10 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm EGTA, 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.4 m NaCl, 10% glycerol, and protease inhibitors). Nuclear extracts in the amount of 40 mg in a volume of 5 ml were loaded onto a precalibrated Sephacryl S-400 HR column with a bed volume of 135 ml (Amersham Biosciences). Gel filtration was done in the same buffer at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. Ninety fractions were collected at 1.5-ml intervals. Upon fractionation, proteins present in each fraction were precipitated by adding 1/10 volumes of ice-cold 100% trichloroacetic acid. Recovered samples were run on SDS-PAGE and analyzed by Western blotting using the indicated antibodies. For detection of FACT-associated complexes, immunoprecipitation was carried out with 10D1 on equal amounts of the selected fractions. Precipitated polypeptides were electrophoretically separated and analyzed by Western blotting. Indirect Immunofluorescence and Confocal Microscopy—All steps of the immunostaining procedure were done at room temperature. HeLa cells were first washed with PBS twice followed by fixation with fresh 2% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 15 min. After a brief rinse in PBS, cells were permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS, blocked with 1% bovine serum albumin in PBS, and probed with the indicated primary antibodies. Secondary antibody incubation was done for 1 h using Alexa 488-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG and Alexa Fluor 594-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Molecular Probes, Inc). To visualize DNA, cells were counter-stained with DAPI. For detection of DNA replication sites, HeLa cells on coverslips were pulse-labeled with 10 μm BrdUrd at 37 °C for 30 min. Upon fixation and permeabilization, cells were subjected sequentially to acid treatment and trypsin enzymatic digestion before being stained (mouse anti-BrdUrd, Sigma). Stained cells were analyzed with the Zeiss LSM-510 inverted confocal laser-scanning microscope, using a 63×/NA 1.4 oil immersion objective lens. Cell Culture, Transfection, and Cell Cycle Synchronization—All HeLa cells were maintained in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 100 units/ml penicillin and streptomycin. Cells were transfected using LipofectAMINE (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. To establish a plasmid-based dsRNAi system targeting endogenous Nek9, annealed oligonucleotides corresponding to partial Nek9 sequence were designed and ligated to the pSilencer 1.0-U6 vector (Ambion) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The cDNA sequence of the targeted Nek9 mRNA region is 5′-GACCATCCGTTCCAATAGC-3′ (nucleotides 2193–2211). The same sequence in the inverted orientation was used as the nonspecific dsRNAi control. Generation of cell lines stably harboring dsRNAi was done by first co-transfecting HeLa cells with pcDNA3 plasmid (bearing the neomycin selection gene) and the ligated pSilencer 1.0-U6 vectors. Positive clones were selected subsequent to a 14-day culturing in the presence of 1 mg/ml G418 and eventually maintained with 0.2 mg/ml G418. For M phase synchronization, subconfluent cells were treated with 200 ng/ml nocodazole for 10 h. Mitotic cells were harvested through detachment by mitotic shake-off. Cells remaining on the flasks after shake-off were harvested by trypsinization and regarded as G2 cells. Cells were synchronized at the G1/S boundary by double thymidine block. Subconfluent culture was blocked with 2 mm thymidine (final) and incubated for 19 h. Cells were washed three times with PBS and then incubated with fresh serum-rich medium for 10 h. Subsequently, the second block with 2 mm thymidine lasted for 15 h, after which the cells were released by extensive washes with PBS. For determination of active DNA replication, immediately before harvest at each time point, cells were pulse-labeled with 10 μm BrdUTP for 15 min. After harvest by trypsinization, cells were fixed with ethanol (70% final), denatured in 2 n HCl for 30 min at 37 °C, and subsequently enzymatically treated with trypsin for 30 min at 37 °C. Cell cycle profiles and degree of BrdUrd labeling were monitored by FACS. Colony Formation Assay—Different clones of both the wild-type and Nek9RNAi cells were seeded into 6-cm diameter tissue culture dishes at 600 or 1200 cells per dish, in triplicate, and grown in the presence of 100 μg/ml G418. Dishes were incubated for 10–12 days in a humidified incubator at 37 °C. Colonies were subsequently fixed with methanol and stained with 1% crystal violet. Fluorescence-activated Cell Sorting (FACS) Analysis—Control and Nek9RNAi cells, after being released from the double thymidine block or mitotic shake-off, were collected by trypsinization at the indicated time points. Cells were washed and then fixed with 70% ethanol for ≥2 h on ice. Cells were stained with DNA-staining solution (100 μg/ml propidium iodine, 100 μg/ml RNase A, and 0.5% Nonidet P-40 in PBS) at room temperature for 30 min. DNA content was analyzed, based on emissions recorded in the FL-2 channel, from 10,000 cells (events) within the fluorescence gate, using a BD Biosciences flow cytometer in conjunction with the Cellquest software. To detect cells actively undergoing DNA replication, BrdUrd incorporation was identified using anti-BrdUrd mAb, followed by Alexa 488-conjugated secondary antibodies, with emissions recorded in the FL-1 channel. The labeling index was determined by calculating the ratio of the gated BrdUrd-positive cells relative to the total events. Immunocomplex Kinase Assay—Whole cell extracts were subjected to immunoprecipitation as described above with the indicated antibodies. Immunocomplexes were washed extensively with lysis buffer (0.3 m NaCl) and equilibrated with the kinase buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm MnCl2, and 1 mm dithiothreitol). For autoactivation, immobilized Nek9 or associated complexes were incubated in kinase buffer supplemented with 100 μm ATP at 25 °C for 20 min. Activation was stopped by either adding electrophoresis sample buffer, where appropriate, or by washing the beads in kinase buffer. Subsequently, activity was assayed by incubation at 30 °C in kinase buffer plus 5 μm ATP, 100 μCi/ml [γ-32P]ATP (Amersham Biosciences), and 1 μg of histone H1. Reactions were terminated by adding 4× Laemmli SDS sample buffer and boiling. Denatured samples were resolved by SDS-PAGE. Peptide Identification by Mass Spectrometry and Bioinformatics Analysis—The gel piece containing selected polypeptides was first reduced and pyridylethylated as described previously (21Tsay Y.G. Wang Y.H. Chiu C.M. Shen B.J. Lee S.C. Anal. Biochem. 2000; 287: 55-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Up to 0.2 μgof the enzyme trypsin (Promega) was added to the dried gel. After overnight incubation, the supernatant was removed, and the gel was extracted twice with adequate amounts of 0.1% formic acid. The supernatant and the extracts were combined together, dried in a Speed-Vac, and resuspended in 0.1% formic acid immediately before use. Electrospray mass spectrometry was performed using a Finnigan Mat LCQ ion trap mass spectrometer interfaced with an ABI 140D high pressure liquid chromatograph (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). A 150 × 0.5-mm PE Brownlee C18 column (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) (5-mm particle diameter, 300-Å pore size) with mobile phases of A (0.1% formic acid in water) and B (0.085% formic acid in acetonitrile) were used. The peptides were eluted using the acetonitrile gradient and analyzed by “triple-play” experiment as described (21Tsay Y.G. Wang Y.H. Chiu C.M. Shen B.J. Lee S.C. Anal. Biochem. 2000; 287: 55-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Data interpretation as well as correlation between the spectra and amino acid sequences within a human EST data base were done by the SEQUEST Browser software package from Finnigan Corp. Identification of Nek9 as a Novel Associated Protein of FACT—To identify key binding partners for the hSpt16-SSRP1 complex, we undertook the immunoaffinity purification scheme to isolate SSRP1-containing protein complexes from the cell nuclei. Nuclear extracts were subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-SSRP1 monoclonal antibodies (clone 10D1). As shown in Fig. 1A, the major protein bands of 140 and 90 kDa correspond to hSpt16 and SSRP1, respectively, as confirmed by Western blot and mass spectrometric analyses (data not shown). Such affinity purification also recovers a 120-kDa polypeptide, which associates with the FACT heterodimer with a molar ratio of ∼1–5. Subsequent spectrometric analysis of this band revealed a sequence match of the identified spectra to the coding sequence of the human Nek9 protein. To further characterize this protein, we generated and affinity-purified polyclonal antibodies against different parts of Nek9, termed αNek9-M (spanning amino acids 291–559) and αNek9-N (spanning amino acids 1–291). Both antibodies specifically recognize a 120-kDa polypeptide in the HeLa cell extracts as well as in the monoclonal antibody 10D1-targeted immunocomplex (Fig. 1B and data not shown). Other anti-SSRP1 monoclonal antibodies, whose approximate epitope regions have been mapped by using deletion constructs of SSRP1 (Fig. 1B, lower panel), were subjected to immunoprecipitation experiments as well. Nek9 was also detected in the immunoprecipitates pulled down by 7F8 but not in those targeted by 3E4 and 2B12, thus indicating its specific association with distinct FACT complexes (Fig. 1B). Additionally, because 10D1 and 7F8 did not crossreact toward Nek9 immunochemically (Fig. 1, B and F, and data not shown), we excluded the possibility here that the co-immunoprecipitated Nek9 arose from nonspecific antibodyepitope binding. While performing a reciprocal co-immunoprecipitation experiment using the anti-Nek9 antibodies, we were able to identify FACT heterodimers in the αNek9-N immunocomplex (Fig. 1C). Immunoprecipitates targeted by αNek9-M, on the other hand, did not contain FACT (Fig. 4A and data not shown). Such observation suggests that αNek9-M targets a fraction of Nek9 that does not associate with FACT in the cells. Altogether, these immunoprecipitation results demonstrate the unique presence of a FACT/Nek9 protein complex in vivo.Fig. 4Phospho-Nek9 associates with FACT in a cell cycle-dependent manner.A, HeLa cells were immunoprecipitated (IP) with the indicated antibodies: control antibody (lane 2), αSSRP1 mAb 10D1 (lane 3), rabbit pre-immune (PI) sera (lane 4), and αNek9-M antibody (lane 5) (cell extract input is shown in lane 1). The presence of Nek9, FACT heterodimers, and phospho-Nek9 was detected by Western blot (WB) analysis using αNek9-M antibody (top), αFACT140 and αSSRP1 antibodies (middle), and α-phospho-Thr210 antibody (bottom), respectively. Position of the upshifted, phosphorylated Nek9 is indicated by the upper arrow, and the lower arrow points to the presumed usual location of Nek9. B, FACT-associated immunocomplex was isolated by αSSRP1 mAb 10D1 from HeLa cells at different cell cycle stages: exponentially growing (lanes 1 and 5), G1/S phase (lane 2), S phase at 1 h after double-thymidine block (lane 3), S phase at 3 h (lane 4), M phase (lane 6), and G2 (lane 7). The presence of Nek9, FACT heterodimers, and phospho-Nek9 was detected by αNek9-M antibody (top), αFACT140 and αSSRP1 antibodies (bottom), and α-phospho-Thr210 antibody (middle), respectively. The arrowhead designates the location of the Thr210-phosphorylated form of Nek9. The graph at the bottom illustrates the changes in the degree of Thr210 phosphorylation (on FACT-associated Nek9) across different phases. The degree of phosphorylation, expressed as a ratio in band intensity of phospho-Nek9 to total Nek9, was normalized to the asynchronous group.

Myc-tagged Nek9 was found to bind immobilized FLAG-FACT140 (lane 2) and His6-SSRP1 (lane 4), whereas no interaction between Myc-Nek9 and other similarly tagged proteins was observed (lanes 5 and 6). Interaction of Nek9 with SSRP1 was also verified through co-infection of respective recombinant baculoviruses followed by co-immunoprecipitation analyses using the M2 antibody (Fig. 1E). Next, in a gel filtration chromatography (using Sephacryl S-400) of the HeLa nuclear extracts, Nek9 elutes with a molecular mass of ∼600 kDa, which is consistent with previous observations (20Roig J. Mikhailov A. Belham C. Avruch J. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 1640-1658Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1F). FACT has overlapping but broader distributions in fractions and appears to exist in higher molecular size protein complexes. To further establish the co-elution of the FACT and Nek9 polypeptides, antibody 10D1 was used to carry out immunoprecipitation on selected fractions. Nek9 was found in the FACT-containing complexes isolated from fractions 20–28, coinciding with the elution profile of endogenous Nek9. Similar co-elution profile was also observed with the 7F8 antibody (data not shown). Taken together, these results validate the stable association of Nek9 with a distinct FACT complex in vivo, whose size is around 600 kDa. However, we cannot presently rule out the possibility of the presence of additional factors in the FACT-Nek9 complexes due to the larger-than-expected molecular mass for the heterotrimer. Nek9 and FACT Partially Co-localize in the Interphase Nucleus and Are Similarly Free from Condensed Chromatin but Dissociate from Each Other during Chromatin Decondensation—The subcellular localization of the endogenous Nek9 protein was determined by indirect immunofluorescence by using the polyclonal antisera directed against Nek9. Results of confocal microscopic analysis indicate that, consistent with the above biochemical evidence, Nek9 exhibits a nuclear distribution in HeLa cells (Fig. 2A, a and b). On the other"

We hypothesized that AdE4+ modulates EC survival through activation of the vascular endothelial (VE)-cadherin/Akt pathway. Here, we showed that AdE4+, but not AdE4- vectors, selectively stimulated phosphorylation of both Akt at Ser473 and Src kinase in ECs. The phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) inhibitors LY294002 and wortmannin abrogated AdE4+ induction of both phospho-Akt expression and prolonged EC survival. Regulation of phospho-Akt was found to be under the control of various factors, namely VE-cadherin activation, Src kinase, tyrosine kinase, extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK). Downstream targets of Akt signaling resulted in glycogen synthase kinase-3α/β phosphorylation, β-catenin up-regulation, and caspase-3 suppression, all of which led to AdE4+-mediated EC survival. Furthermore, infection with AdE4+ vectors increased the angiogenic potential of ECs by promoting EC migration and capillary tube formation in Matrigel plugs. This selective AdE4+-mediated enhanced motility of ECs was also blocked by PI3K inhibitors.

ECs are important target cells for gene therapy because they are readily accessible to Ad vectors via the circulation and play a critical role in the progression of physiological and pathophysiological processes, including wound healing, apoptosis, inflammation, tissue revascularization, and tumor angiogenesis. We and other groups demonstrated previously that infection of ECs with first-generation AdE4+ vectors, but not AdE4- vectors, selectively modulates the angiogenic potential of ECs by altering apoptosis and the inflammatory status of ECs (1Leppard K.N.

Remarkably, infection with AdE4+ vectors resulted in the generation of a unique “suspended animation” state where the cells remain viable without requiring stimulation with serum or growth factors for several months. However, the mechanisms by which AdE4+ promotes long-term survival of ECs have yet to be clarified. The phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt signal cascade is involved in the regulation of apoptosis, survival, and proliferation of a wide variety of cell types (5Romashkova J.A. Makarov S.S. Nature. 1999; 401: 86-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (1665) Google Scholar), including ECs (6Ma H. Calderon T.M. Fallon J.T. Berman J.W. Atherosclerosis. 2002; 164: 79-87Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). PI3K activates the Akt serine/threonine kinase by generating specific inositol phospholipids that recruit Akt to the cell membrane and enable its activation. PI3K/Akt signaling is activated by various growth factors, including VEGF-A, FGF-2, and platelet-derived growth factor (7Datta S.R. Brunet A. Greenberg M.E. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2905-2927Crossref PubMed Scopus (3717) Google Scholar, 8Gerber H.P. McMurtrey A. Kowalski J. Yan M. Keyt B.A. Dixit V. Ferrara N. J. Biol.

Lampugnani M.G. Moons L. Breviario F. Compernolle V. Bono F. Balconi G. Spagnuolo R. Oostuyse B. Dewerchin M. Zanetti A. Angellilo A. Mattot V. Nuyens D. Lutgens E. Clotman F. de Ruiter M.C.

PI3K is activated by binding to phosphorylated receptors, and the resulting phosphoinositides recruit the kinases Akt and 3-phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase-1 via pleckstrin homology domains (10Hemmings B.A. Science. 1997; 275: 628-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar). VE-cadherin is a member of the cadherin superfamily that is specifically expressed at EC junctions (11Carmeliet P. Collen D. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 2000; 902: 249-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). Its extracellular adhesive domain interacts via its cytoplasmic tail with the armadillo family proteins β-catenin, plakoglobin, and α-catenin (12Lampugnani M.G. Corada M. Caveda L. Breviario F. Ayalon O. Geiger B. Dejana E. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 203-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar), which couple the cadherin-catenin complex to the actin cytoskeleton. This complex is known to be involved in controlling endothelial survival and motility. We hypothesized that the Akt signaling pathway, through activation of the VE-cadherin, plays an important role in AdE4+ promotion of EC survival and that the VE-cadherin/Akt signaling pathway can regulate the AdE4+ pro-survival effects on EC. Here, we demonstrate that AdE4+ significantly protected ECs against apoptosis through the recruitment of the VE-cadherin/Akt-signaling cascade. Moreover, this AdE4+ effect is associated with alterations of EC migration and vessel-like tube formation, suggesting that AdE4+-mediated activation of this pathway also regulates the angiogenic potential of ECs. Cell Culture—Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) and human umbilical smooth muscle cells were isolated as described (13Zhang F. Hackett N.R. Lam G. Cheng J. Pergolizzi R. Luo L. Shmelkov S.V. Edelberg J. Crystal R.G. Rafii S. Blood. 2003; 102: 2115-2121Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) and cultured in EC medium (M199 medium containing 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum, 20 μg/ml EC growth factor, 20 units/ml heparin, 100 μg/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin) in a humidified incubator at 37 °C with 95% air/5% CO2. HUVEC monolayers between passages 2 to 4 were used in these studies. A549 (human lung carcinoma cells), HL60 (leukemic cell lines), HeLa (human cervix carcinoma cells), and primary human foreskin fibroblast cells (HFF) were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Manassas, VA); human pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells, human liver endothelial cells, and human vein endothelial cells were obtained from Clonetics. Cell viability was assayed by the trypan blue exclusion method, which indicated that <5% of the cells took up the dye both before and after the infection of Ad vectors. Construction of Ad Vectors—The Ad vectors used in this study included the following: AdNull (E1-, E3-, E4+, and cytomegalovirus early-immediate promoter/enhancer; no transgene in the expression cassette) (14Hersh J. Crystal R.G. Bewig B. Gene Ther. 1995; 2: 124-131PubMed Google Scholar); AdLacZ(E4+) (E1-, E3-, E4+; cytomegalovirus promoter driving the β-galactosidase (β-gal) gene); AdGFP (identical to E1-E3-E4+ AdLacZ, but with a modified form of the Aeguorea victoria green fluorescent protein (GFP) cDNA in place of β-gal); adenoviral luciferase (AdLuc) (E1-, E3-, E4+; cytomegalovirus promoter driving the luciferase gene); AdLacZ(E4-) (same as AdLacZ, but with a complete deletion of the E4 gene by using the β-gal gene as a spacer in the E4 region); and AdE4 open reading frame (ORF) 6 (E1-E3- expresses only E4 ORF 6 from the E4 promoter, and all other E4 ORFs were deleted). A second generation AdE4+ (E1-, E2b-, E3-, and E4+) vector was constructed as described previously (15Amalfitano A. Hauser M.A. Hu H. Serra D. Begy C.R. Chamberlain J.S. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 926-933Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Ad vectors were amplified in 293 cells and purified by cesium chloride centrifugation and dialysis as described previously (16Crystal R.G. McElvaney N.G. Rosenfeld M.A. Chu C.S. Mastrangeli A. Hay J.G. Brody S.L. Jaffe H.A. Eissa N.T. Danel C. Nat. Genet. 1994; 8: 42-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (791) Google Scholar). All Ad vectors had a particle/plaque-forming unit ratio of ∼100. Western Blot Analysis—Cells were lysed in radioimmune precipitation buffer (50 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate, and 10 μg/ml aprotinin). Insoluble debris was pelleted, and the protein concentration of the supernatant was determined with a DC protein assay kit (Bio-Rad). Fifty micrograms of each protein sample were separated on 10% SDS-PAGE gels. The protein samples were then transferred to nitrocellulose membrane. Protein expression was confirmed by immunoblotting with the following antibodies: Ser473-phospho-Akt, Tyr308-phospho-Akt, Akt, phospho-GSK-3α/β, and cleaved caspase-3 (Cell Signaling); Tyr416-phospho-Src (Upstate Cell Signaling Solutions); β-catenin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology); and VE-cadherin (BV9; Imclone Systems). After incubation with the appropriate primary and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies, the membranes were developed with enhanced chemiluminescence reagent (Amersham Biosciences). Terminal Deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated dUTP Nick-end Labeling (TUNEL) Assay—The TUNEL assay was performed by using the in situ cell detection kit (fluorescein isothiocyanate) following the manufacturer's instructions (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). In brief, cells grown on gelatin-pretreated glass coverslips were fixed by a freshly prepared 4% paraformaldehyde solution (in PBS, pH 7.4) for 1 h at room temperature. Coverslips were then washed with PBS and incubated in permeabilization solution (0.1% Triton X-100 and 0.1% sodium citrate) for 2 min on ice. Then, 50 μl of TUNEL reaction mixture was added on coverslips and incubated in a humidified chamber for 1 h at 37 °C in the dark. Finally, cells were mounted and analyzed by fluorescence microscopy. Determination of the Caspase-3 Activity—The activity of caspase-3 in EC lysates (2 × 105 cells/sample) was determined using the caspase-3 colorimetric assay kit according to the manufacturer's instructions (R&D Systems). 150 μg of protein were used per reaction and incubated for 2 h at 37 °C. The colorimetric reaction products were determined at 505 nm. Migration Assays—Migration assays were performed by a modification of the procedure described previously using a Boyden chamber (17Witzenbichler B. Kureishi Y. Luo Z. Le Roux A. Branellec D. Walsh K. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 104: 1469-1480Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). HUVECs were infected with or without Ad vectors overnight in serum-free media (X-vivo medium). Transduced cells were suspended with 1% collagenase and washed with phosphate-buffered saline. Cells were resuspended in serum-free medium and put into the coated fibronectin chamber (3-μm pores size; BD Biosciences). VEGF-A (10 ng/ml) and FGF-2 (10 ng/ml) in 5% fetal bovine serum X-vivo medium were put into the lower chamber. The chamber was incubated for 22 h at 37 °C. The filter was carefully removed, and cells attached on the upper side were wiped off. HUVECs migrating through the filter and appearing on the lower side were fixed by careful immersion of the filter into 70% ethanol for 15 min followed by crystal violet staining at 25 °C for 1 h, and the HUVECs were counted in 10 random fields per side of chamber. Each experiment was repeated three times to achieve statistical significance. Tube Formation Assay—The formation of vascular-like structures by HUVECs on Matrigel (Becton Dickinson) was semi-quantified by phase-contrast microscopy. Twenty-four-well culture plates were coated with Matrigel according to the manufacturer's instructions. HUVECs were infected with or without adenovirus and then seeded on coated plates at 5 × 104 cell/well in serum-free medium and incubated at 37 °C for 8 h. HUVECs were seeded on coated plate in serum-free medium containing VEGF-A, 10 ng/ml, and FGF-2, 10 ng/ml, as positive control. AdE4+ Vectors Selectively Prolong Survival of ECs by Preventing Apoptosis—Infection of HUVEC with E4+, but not E4-, adenoviral vectors supports survival of these cells in serum- and growth factor-free culture conditions. Remarkably, HUVEC monolayers infected with AdE4+ vectors show no decrease in cell number for at least 10 days (Fig. 1, A and B). In contrast, HUVEC monolayers infected with either control or E4-deficient Ad (AdE4-) vectors, including AdE4-LacZ and AdE4 ORF 6, do not survive in serum- or growth factor-free conditions by day 10. The infection of HUVEC with adenovirus vectors is highly efficient, and virtually all of the HUVEC express β-gal after infection with AdE4+LacZ or AdE4-LacZ (Fig. 1C). Second generation Ad vectors containing E4 with deletions of E1, E3, and, additionally, E2b genes are associated with decreased risk of adenovirus-derived gene expression and, thus, are less likely to induce immune responses or to be cleared via cell-mediated immune responses (15Amalfitano A. Hauser M.A. Hu H. Serra D. Begy C.R. Chamberlain J.S. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 926-933Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Harris J.D. Graham I.R. Schepelmann S. Stannard A.K. Roberts M.L. Hodges B.L. Hill V. Amalfitano A. Hassall D.G. Owen J.S. Dickson G. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2002; 11: 43-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). HUVECs infected with a second generation AdE4+ vector survive at rates similar to those treated with first generation AdE4+ (Fig. 2A). Microvascular ECs from each organ have unique physiological attributes. Therefore, we investigated the effects of AdE4+ infection on survival in various organ-specific ECs, namely human pulmonary endothelial cells, human liver endothelial cells, and human vein endothelial cells. AdE4+ infection of these various ECs also resulted in survival effects similar to those observed in HUVECs under serum- and growth factor-free conditions (Fig. 2B). To assess whether AdE4+ pro-survival effect is restricted to human ECs, we evaluated the effect of AdE4+ in non-ECs, including A549 (lung carcinoma), HL60 (leukemic cell lines), HeLa (cervical carcinoma), HFF cells, and human umbilical smooth muscle cells. Remarkably, in contrast to ECs, there were no alterations in the apoptotic or survival state of these other non-EC cell types after infection with AdE4+ vectors (data not shown) as assessed by TUNEL assay or cell number. These findings indicate that the pro-survival effects of AdE4+ are primarily specific for EC type. To examine the effect of AdE4+ on the apoptosis of ECs, both TUNEL assay and caspase-3 activity were employed to evaluate the extent to which the AdE4+ gene suppressed EC apoptosis. After 48 h of serum and growth factor starvation, HUVEC monolayers began to apoptose, as evidenced by the TUNEL assay (Fig. 3A). In contrast, AdE4+-treated HUVECs remained robust and showed no indication of apoptosis. Caspase-3 activation was also measured as an indicator of apoptosis induction, because different upstream pathways that lead to apoptosis depend on caspase-3 induction for final apoptotic execution. Fig. 3B shows that AdE4+, but not AdE4-, markedly suppressed caspase-3 activity in ECs, even under serum- and growth factor-free conditions. In addition, EC monolayers cultured in the presence of serum and growth factors were also treated with calcium ionophore A23187, which directly increases the concentration of intracellular Ca2+ and induces cell apoptosis. Remarkably, AdE4+ effectively blocked the onset of apoptosis induced by A23187 (Fig. 3C). These data suggest that AdE4+ infection can also protect ECs from Ca2+ influx-induced cell apoptosis. AdE4+ Inhibition of EC Apoptosis Is Mediated via Activation of the PI3K/Akt Pathway—Because the protein kinase Akt is an important survival factor that suppresses EC apoptosis (7Datta S.R. Brunet A. Greenberg M.E. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2905-2927Crossref PubMed Scopus (3717) Google Scholar), we examined whether AdE4+ regulates the PI3K/Akt signaling cascade. Treatment of EC cultures with two selective and structurally unrelated PI3K inhibitors, LY294002 (10 μm) or wortmannin (500 nm), abolished the ability of AdE4+ to rescue EC from apoptosis following growth factor withdrawal (Fig. 4A). LY294002 and wortmannin also reverted the inhibition of caspase-3 activation by AdE4+ (data not shown). Because Akt activation is a critical downstream effector of PI3K, we initially tested whether AdE4+ infection of EC is associated with Akt phosphorylation. Akt phosphorylation was assessed by immunoblot analysis in EC using a phospho-specific anti-Akt antibody. Immunoblot analysis of EC infected with AdE4+ vector in serum- and growth factor-free conditions revealed significant up-regulation of the expression of Akt phosphorylated at Ser473 at a maximum of 48 h by AdE4+, but not AdE4- infection, and remained constant until at least 72 h (Fig. 4B). Total Akt levels remained unchanged, and Akt phosphorylated at Thr308 expression was not detectable (data not shown). In addition, AdE4+ induced phosphorylation of Src kinase, which is an upstream activator of PI3K/Akt (Fig. 4B). However, AdE4+ did not significantly alter the expression of phospho-Akt in non-EC lines, including the A549 cell line or primary HFF cells (Fig. 4C). These data suggest that AdE4+ promotes survival specifically in EC via the Akt phosphorylation pathway. AdE4+ Directly Induces Akt Phosphorylation via Tyrosine Kinase, ERK, and JNK Pathways—To determine whether AdE4+ activates signals leading to phosphorylation of Akt or inhibits the dephosphorylation of Akt, HUVECs were infected with AdE4+ in the presence of PI3K inhibitors LY294002, wortmannin, or Src kinase inhibitor PP2. As shown in Fig. 5A, AdE4+-mediated induction of phospho-Akt expression was blocked by LY294002 or wortmannin. The Src kinase inhibitor PP2, but not the inactive tyrosine kinase inhibitor PP3 (data not shown), also partly suppressed AdE4+-mediated induction of phospho-Akt expression (Fig. 5A); however, PP2 did not significantly alter the AdE4+-prolonged EC survival (Fig. 5C). These data suggest that the AdE4+ effect is mediated by phosphorylation of Akt in ECs. Both receptor tyrosine kinase and nonreceptor tyrosine kinase are involved upstream of PI3K/Akt (19Davis M.E. Cai H. Drummond G.R. Harrison D.G. Circ. Res. 2001; 89: 1073-1080Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar, 20Mineo C. Yuhanna I.S. Quon M.J. Shaul P.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 9142-9149Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). To dissect the pathway mediating phospho-Akt activation, we examined the effects of genistein, a widely used inhibitor of tyrosine kinase activity, on AdE4+-promoted EC survival. Fig. 5C shows that survival of EC by AdE4+ was significantly inhibited by treatment with 50 μm genistein. Also, pretreatment with genistein abolished AdE4+-induced phoshpo-Akt expression (Fig. 5B). As MAPKs have been implicated in the regulation of phosphorylation of Akt, we also assessed the role of MAPKs in the regulation of phospho-Akt in EC after AdE4+ infection. As shown in Fig. 5D, AdE4+-induced activation of phospho-Akt was inhibited by pretreatment with PD98059 (a selective inhibitor of ERK) or SP600125 (a selective inhibitor of JNK), but not by SB203580 (a selective inhibitor of p38-MAPK). These data indicate that ERK and JNK are the upstream activators of PI3K in the signaling pathways activated by AdE4+. Selective Activation of EC-specific VE-cadherin by AdE4+ Vectors—VE-cadherin and the intracellular β-catenin binding region of VE-cadherin have been shown to play an important role in Akt activation and EC survival (9Carmeliet P.

To assess the effect of AdE4+ on VE-cadherin and β-catenin levels, EC lysates from control and AdE4- and AdE4+ cell cultures were analyzed by Western blot using specific anti-VE-cadherin and anti-β-catenin antibodies. As shown in Fig. 6A, VE-cadherin and β-catenin protein levels were increased after infection with AdE4+. Because the anti-VE-cadherin antibody can directly inhibit VE-cadherin function in ECs (21Corada M. Zanetta L. Orsenigo F. Breviario F. Lampugnani M.G. Bernasconi S. Liao F. Hicklin D.J. Bohlen P. Dejana E. Blood. 2002; 100: 905-911Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar), we then used neutralizing monoclonal antibody (BV9) to VE-cadherin in cell cultures infected with AdE4+. BV9 significantly suppressed AdE4+-promoted EC survival (Fig. 6B) and blocked AdE4+-induced phospho-Akt in ECs (Fig. 6C). These data suggest that VE-cadherin and β-catenin participate as activators of the PI3K signaling pathway in AdE4+-mediated survival of ECs. As VE-cadherin is only expressed on the ECs but not on the other cell types, this may explain why AdE4+-mediated induction of EC survival is restricted to ECs. It is conceivable that AdE4+ gene products specifically recruit VE-cadherin. AdE4+ Increased GSK3 α/β Phosphorylation and Decreased Caspase-3 Activation—GSK3α/β and caspase-3 are downstream targets of Akt signaling; both phosphorylation of GSK3α/β and suppression of activation of caspase-3 block the pathways leading to EC apoptosis. As shown by Western blot analysis in Fig. 7, AdE4+, but not AdE4-, stimulated GSK3α/β phosphorylation in a time-dependent manner with maximal expression occurring within 48 h and sustained phosphorylation lasting for at least 4 days. At the same time, activation of caspase-3 was suppressed by AdE4+, suggesting that phosphorylation of GSK3α/β and reduction of caspase-3 activity are involved in the AdE4+ survival effect. AdE4+ Promotes EC Migration and Tube Formation in ECs—Migration and tube formation are important angiogenic functions of ECs essential for the assembly of functional neo-vessels. To examine whether AdE4+ also affects the angiogenic potential of EC, the migration of AdE4+-infected ECs was assessed in a modified Boyden chamber. AdE4+, but not AdE4-, increased EC migration in response to VEGF-A by 3-fold, whereas AdE4- infection resulted in a statistically insignificant rate of migration (Fig. 8). This response was blocked by prior administration of the PI3K inhibitor LY294002 (10 μm). A Matrigel tube formation assay was also employed to test the effect of AdE4+ on the angiogenic potential of ECs. Infection of AdE4+ vectors, but not AdE4- vectors, induced the assembly of typical sprouting and tube-like structures that are reminiscent of vessels typically formed in vivo (Fig. 8B). This angiogenic effect is similar to that of VEGF-A treatment, which induces EC tube formation in Matrigel. These results indicate that AdE4+-infected ECs maintain their angiogenic potential in the absence of growth factors. Therefore, the overall effect of AdE4+ gene products is not only to increase survival but also to maintain the pro-angiogenic properties of ECs. Dissecting the mechanism by which E4+ adenoviral vectors modulate angiogenesis is important to diminish the toxicities associated with adenoviral gene therapy. The importance of VE-cadherin/Akt signaling in the selective modulation of EC survival (9Carmeliet P. Lampugnani M.G. Moons L. Breviario F. Compernolle V. Bono F. Balconi G. Spagnuolo R. Oostuyse B. Dewerchin M. Zanetti A. Angellilo A. Mattot V. Nuyens D. Lutgens E. Clotman F. de Ruiter M.C. Gittenberger-de Groot A. Poelmann R. Lupu F. Herbert J.M. Collen D. Dejana E. Cell. 1999; 98: 147-157Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1054) Google Scholar) offers a new perspective for discerning the mechanism whereby E4 gene products specifically support EC survival. In the present study, our results provide further evidence that AdE4+ vectors selectively protect ECs from apoptosis and maintain their angiogenic potential through recruitment of the VE-cadherin/Akt signaling pathway. Our data show that protein tyrosine kinases, such as Src family kinases, are involved in AdE4+-mediated PI3K/Akt activation and EC survival. AdE4+ activation of Src or other receptor tyrosine kinase ligands is the key mediator of activation of Akt. Src kinase has been implicated in the control of cell division, the production of autocrine growth factors, and the cell's survival response (22Courtneidge S.A. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2002; 30: 11-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The inhibitory effect of the Src inhibitor PP2 and tyrosine kinase inhibitor genistein suggests that the Src family or some other tyrosine kinase is a crucial upstream activator of the PI3K/Akt pathway that is activated by the AdE4+ vectors. AdE4+-induced Akt phosphorylation promotes survival of ECs by modulating downstream targets of this kinase. These include caspase-3, GSK-3α/β, Bad, and Bcl2. GSK-3α/β is a serine-threonine kinase that is involved in multiple cellular signaling pathways. It is inhibited upon Ser9 phosphorylation by growth factor receptor-induced activation of Akt and has been shown to participate in apoptosis in several cell types and induce caspase-3 activation (23King T.D. Bijur G.N. Jope R.S. Brain Res. 2001; 919: 106-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Increased phosphorylation of GSK-3α/β inhibits activity of GSK-3α/β, whereas lithium chloride, a GSK-3α/β inhibitor, induced GSK-3α/β N-terminal phosphorylation through direct inhibition of GSK-3α/β (24Zhang F. Phiel C.J. Spece L. Gurvich N. Klein P.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 33067-33077Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar). AdE4+-induced GSK-3α/β phosphorylation may thus regulate β-catenin accumulation and protect against EC apoptosis (25Tepera S.B. McCrea P.D. Rosen J.M. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 1137-1149Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Moreover, it has been demonstrated that angiogenesis is inhibited by GSK-3α/β activation in an in vivo Matrigel plug assay, whereas the inhibition of GSK-3α/β signaling enhances capillary formation (26Kim H.S. Skurk C. Thomas S.R. Bialik A. Suhara T. Kureishi Y. Birnbaum M. Keaney Jr., J.F. Walsh K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 41888-41896Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). In addition, it has been shown that FGF, insulin, and epidermal growth factor can inhibit GSK-3α/β activation through increased Ser9 phosphorylation to promote cell survival (27Hashimoto M. Sagara Y. Langford D. Everall I.P. Mallory M. Everson A. Digicaylioglu M. Masliah E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 32985-32991Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Enhancement in Akt and GSK-3α/β phosphorylation could be due to increase in glucose uptake, glycolysis, and glucose transporter expression, which have been shown to inhibit cytochrome c release and prevent apoptosis (28Loberg R.D. Vesely E. Brosius III, F.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 41667-41673Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). We showed that the infection of ECs with AdE4+ vectors resulted in GSK-3α/β phosphorylation, which may contribute to AdE4+-induced prolongation of EC survival. The ability of EC to migrate in response to VEGF-A was significantly increased by the infection of AdE4+ vectors in the Matrigel and migration assays. Inhibition of PI3K by LY294002 suppressed this effect, suggesting that PI3K is central to the angiogenic pathway. Previous studies have shown that the anti-VE-cadherin antibody is able to block tube formation in a fibrin gel (29Bach T.L. Barsigian C. Yaen C.H. Martinez J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30719-30728Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 30Bach T.L. Barsigian C. Chalupowicz D.G. Busler D. Yaen C.H. Grant D.S. Martinez J. Exp. Cell Res. 1998; 238: 324-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Taken together, these results indicate that the VE-cadherin/Akt pathway is a critical intracellular signaling step for angiogenesis in ECs. Remarkably, the effect of the AdE4+ vector on protective apoptosis and maintaining migration in ECs is similar to that of classic angiogenic factors, including FGF-2, VEGF-A, or platelet-derived growth factor. Inhibition of VE-cadherin did not completely block the pro-survival effect of AdE4+ vectors, suggesting that VE-cadherin-independent signaling pathways may also be involved in AdE4+ pro-survival effects. Alternatively, up-regulation of FGF-2, which activates additional survival pathways, may contribute to AdE4+-mediated survival of ECs. Both VEGF-A and FGF-2 have been shown to differentially activate Raf, resulting in protection from distinct pathways of EC apoptosis (31Alavi A. Hood J.D. Frausto R. Stupack D.G. Cheresh D.A. Science. 2003; 301: 94-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). In agreement with this finding, we showed that neutralizing monoclonal antibodies to VE-cadherin did not suppress FGF-2-mediated survival of ECs. First generation E1-E3- Ad vectors are not completely replication defective, whereas the E2, E3, and E4 promoters may be still active and allow viral replication and late gene expression to proceed at high titers of Ad vectors (32Nevins J.R. Cell. 1981; 26: 213-220Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). The resulting replication-competent adenoviral vector (RCA) may affect EC survival. However, new Ad vectors with deletions of the E1, E3, and E2b genes decrease the risk for RCA and late gene expression and have undetectable levels of RCA (15Amalfitano A. Hauser M.A. Hu H. Serra D. Begy C.R. Chamberlain J.S. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 926-933Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Harris J.D. Graham I.R. Schepelmann S. Stannard A.K. Roberts M.L. Hodges B.L. Hill V. Amalfitano A.

Virol. 1996; 70: 4173-4178Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Our results demonstrated that a recombinant adenovirus vector with E1, E2a, and E3 deletions has a similar effect with the first generation Ad vector to promote EC survival (Fig. 2A), which further indicated that AdE4+ gene products contribute to EC survival. In summary, the present study demonstrated that AdE4+, but not AdE4-, induced VE-cadherin/Akt activation in ECs. Phospho-Akt activation by AdE4+ is mediated by VE-cadherin, tyrosine kinase, and the MAPK of ERK and JNK. Our results suggest that the AdE4+-mediated VE-cadherin/Akt pathway ultimately effects EC survival and angiogenesis. E4 region of Ad vectors contains at least six ORFs that confer a variety of regulatory functions. The precise identity of E4 ORF proteins that induce activation of Akt/VE-cadherin is not known and is the subject of ongoing studies."
https://openalex.org/W2009197621,"Frontotemporal dementia and Parkinsonism linked to chromosome 17 (FTDP-17) is an autosomal dominant neurodegenerative disorder caused by mutations in the gene that encodes for tau, a microtubule-binding protein. Neuropathologically the disease is characterized by extensive neuronal loss in the frontal and temporal lobes and the filamentous accumulation of hyperphosphorylated tau. The R406W missense mutation was originally described in an American and a Dutch family. Although R406W tau is hyperphosphorylated in FTDP-17 cases, R406W tau expressed in cell model systems has not shown increased phosphorylation. The purpose of this study was to establish a neuronal model system in which the phosphorylation of R406W tau is increased and thus more representative of the in vivo situation. To accomplish this goal immortalized mouse cortical cells that express low levels of endogenous tau were stably transfected with human wild type or R406W tau. In this neuronal model R406W tau was more highly phosphorylated at numerous epitopes and showed decreased microtubule binding compared with wild type tau, an effect that could be reversed by dephosphorylation. In addition the expression of R406W tau in the cortical cells resulted in increased cell death as compared with wild type tau-expressing cells when the cells were exposed to an apoptotic stressor. These results indicate that in an appropriate cellular context R406W tau is hyperphosphorylated, which leads to decreased microtubule binding. Furthermore, expression of R406W tau sensitized cells to apoptotic stress, which may contribute to the neuronal cell loss that occurs in this FTDP-17 tauopathy."
https://openalex.org/W2053380205,"Phosphatidylserine (PtdSer) is transported from its site of synthesis in the endoplasmic retiuculum to the locus of PtdSer decarboxylase 2 (Psd2p) in the Golgi/vacuole and decarboxylated to form phosphatidylethanolamine. Recent biochemical and genetic evidence has implicated the C2 domain of Psd2p and a membrane-bound form of the phosphatidylinositol binding/transfer protein, PstB2p, as essential for this transport process. We devised a reconstituted system in which chemically defined donor membranes function to transfer PtdSer to the biological acceptor membranes containing Psd2p. The transfer of PtdSer is poor when the donor membranes have a high degree of curvature but markedly enhanced when the membranes are relatively planar (≥400-nm diameter). PtdSer transfer is also dependent upon both the bulk and the surface concentrations of the lipid, with pure PtdSer vesicles acting as the most efficient donors at all concentrations. The lipid transfer from donor membranes containing either 100% PtdSer or 50% PtdSer at a fixed concentration (e.g. 250 μm PtdSer) differs by a factor of 20. Surface dilution of PtdSer by choline, ethanolamine, glycerol, and inositol phospholipids markedly inhibits PtdSer transfer, whereas phosphatidic acid (PtdOH) stimulates the transfer. Most importantly, the transfer of PtdSer from liposomes to Psd2p fails to occur in acceptor membranes from strains lacking PstB2p or the C2 domain of Psd2p.

These screens and assays follow the synthesis of PtdSer in donor membranes and its subsequent decarboxylation to form phosphatidylethanolamine (PtdEtn) in acceptor membranes. The formation of this PtdEtn provides a distinct biochemical marker for the transfer reaction. In yeast, there are two PtdSer decarboxylases, Psd1p and Psd2p, that are located in the mitochondria and the Golgi/vacuole, respectively (17Trotter P.J. Pedretti J. Voelker D.R. J. Biol.

Combined genetic and biochemical experiments have thus far implicated one protein in transport of PtdSer between a subfraction of the endoplasmic reticulum (known as the mitochondria-associated membrane) and mitochondria (21Schumacher M.M.

Choi J.Y. Voelker D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 51033-51042Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Thus far, three proteins have been implicated in the transfer of PtdSer to the locus of Psd2p. One of these proteins is the phosphatidylinositol-4-kinase, Stt4p (24Trotter P.J. Wu W.I. Pedretti J.

Chem. 1994; 269: 1166-1171Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A second protein is a phosphatidylinositol (PtdIns) transfer/binding protein, PstB2p (7Wu W.I. Routt S. Bankaitis V.A. Voelker D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14446-14456Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The third protein motif is the C2 domain of the Psd2p (26Kitamura H. Wu W.I. Voelker D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 33720-33726Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Our previous data provide some support for a model in which docking reactions occur between donor/acceptor pairs of membranes that enable lipid transport to occur between them (16Voelker D.R. J. Lipid Res. 2003; 44: 441-449Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). These docking reactions may require protein modification (e.g. protein ubiquitination), lipid modification (e.g. phosphorylation of PtdIns), and specific lipid binding reactions, by the actions of PstB2p and the C2 domain of Psd2p and/or other proteins. One current hypothesis is that macromolecular assemblies form on and between both the donor and acceptor membranes to create zones of adhesion, within which specific proteins function to transport phospholipids (16Voelker D.R. J. Lipid Res. 2003; 44: 441-449Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar).Previous studies have established conditions for the transport of nascent PtdSer from its site of synthesis to the locus of Psd2p in intact cells, permeabilized cells, and isolated membranes (7Wu W.I.

In all cases, the transport of PtdSer required the presence of the PstB2p and the C2 domain of Psd2p on the acceptor membrane. In an effort to further deconstruct and reconstitute the transport reaction, we have now addressed the problem of defining the basic molecular requirement for producing competent donor membranes. These studies focused upon defining 1) the minimal physical requirements, 2) the lipid compositional requirements, 3) the ionic requirements, and 4) the fidelity of defined donors in the PtdSer transport reaction. Our results demonstrate that planar PtdSer-rich domains function optimally in the transport reaction with the same genetic and molecular constraints observed for the process in vivo.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESChemicals—Simple salts, buffers, and amino acids were from Fisher and Sigma.

Acceptor membranes lacking PstB2p were derived from WWY66 (MATα ura3 his3 lys2 leu2 trp1 suc2 psd1-Δ1::TRP1 pstB2::HIS3). Acceptor membranes containing Psd2p lacking a C2 domain were derived from PTY44 (MATα ura3 his3 lys2 leu2 trp1 psd1-Δ1::TRP1 psd2-Δ1::HIS3) harboring a YEp352-PSD2/C2Δ plasmid. The PTY44 strain was also used for plasmid-based expression of Psd2p from YEp 352-PSD2. The yeast strains were routinely grown in Complete medium containing (per liter) 1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, 2% glucose, 20 mg/ml each adenine and uracil, and 2 mm ethanolamine as required (YPDAUE medium). The final pH of the medium was adjusted to 6.9. The PTY44 strain harboring YEp352-PSD2 or YEp352-PSD2/C2Δ was grown in the absence of uracil on synthetic complete medium with 2% glucose and supplemented with 2 mm ethanolamine.Preparation of Membranes—Yeasts in 1-liter cultures were grown to an A660 = 1.8 and harvested by centrifugation at 5000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C.

The resultant pellet was resuspended at 0.5 g, wet weight, in 1 ml of buffer (100 mm Tris-sulfate, pH 9.4, and 10 mm dithiothreitol) and incubated at 37 °C for 10 min. Next the cells were centrifuged at 1000 × g for 5 min at ambient temperature. The cell pellet was resuspended in 50 ml of 1.2 m sorbitol and recentrifuged. The resultant pellet was resuspended at 0.15 g, wet weight, in 1 ml of spheroplasting buffer, containing 1.2 m sorbitol, 1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, and 0.5% glucose. Zymolyase was added at 5 mg of enzyme/g, wet weight, of cells for the purpose of degrading the yeast cell wall. The cell suspension was incubated a 30 °C with gentle agitation for 45 min. At the end of the incubation, the spheroplasts were harvested by centrifugation at 2000 × g for 5 min. The spheroplasts were washed in 50 ml of 1.2 m sorbitol and recovered by centrifugation. The final spheroplast pellet was resuspended in 100 ml of regeneration buffer, containing 0.7 m sorbitol, 0.75% yeast extract, 1.5% peptone, and 1% glucose. This spheroplast suspension was incubated at 30 °C for 20 min with shaking at 120 rpm to allow the cells to physiologically recover from the spheroplasting procedure. After regeneration, the cells were washed in 50 ml of 1.2 m sorbitol and collected by centrifugation. The pellet was resuspended in 5 ml of cold homogenization buffer containing 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0; 0.5 mm EDTA; 0.3 m sucrose; 1 mm 2-mercaptoethanol; 10 μg/ml antipain, leupeptin, and aprotinin; 1 μg/ml pepstatin A; and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The cells were homogenized using 15 strokes with the B pestle of a Dounce homogenizer (Kontes). The homogenate was centrifuged at 1500 × g for 5 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant was saved. The pellet derived from the first centrifugation was again homogenized and centrifuged in the same manner to yield a second supernatant, which was combined with the first supernatant. The supernatants were centrifuged at 30,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. The new supernatant was harvested and centrifuged at 4 × 105 × g for 1 h. The membrane pellet was resuspended in 3 ml of homogenization buffer and homogenized using a motor-driven pestle in a glass tube. The final membrane suspension was adjusted to 3.5 ml/liter of starting culture and stored at –80 °C in 200-μl aliquots. These membranes remain competent to act as acceptors for lipid transport for at least 6 months.Preparation of Liposomes—All lipids were obtained from Avanti Polar Lipids. Multilamellar liposomes were prepared by first removing organic solvents from the stock lipid solutions using nitrogen evaporation. The dried lipid films were hydrated in 10 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.0, 0.1 m KCl at 30 °C, for 1 h. The lipid suspension was subjected to vortex mixing for 5 min at room temperature to create multilamellar liposomes. Unilamellar liposomes were prepared either by sonication or membrane extrusion. For sonication, the multilamellar liposomes were placed in glass tubes and probe-sonicated on ice for 30 s followed by cooling for 30 s. The sonication-cooling cycle was performed three times. The sonicated liposome suspension was briefly centrifuged at 1000 × g for 3 min to remove titanium particles shed from the probe. For membrane extrusion, we used an Avestin Liposofast apparatus. The multilamellar liposome suspensions were converted to unilamellar vesicles of defined size, using 25 passes through polycarbonate filters of either 50-, 100-, 200-, 400-, or 1000-nm diameter, as specified in individual experiments.Enzyme Assays—The transport-coupled decarboxylation assay was performed in a volume of 40 μl containing 25 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.0, 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 150 mm KCl, and substrates ranging from 50 to 500 μm total lipid. Membranes containing Psd2p and 60 μg of total protein were added to the incubations containing the liposome substrates. The specific radioactivity of the Ptd[1′-14C]Ser substrate added to the reactions was 0.9 μCi/μmol of total lipid. The reactions were performed in gas-tight tubes with an insert well for trapping CO2 on 2 m KOH-impregnated filter paper. Reactions were performed at 30 °C for 20 min and terminated by the addition of 50 μl of 0.25 m H2SO4 introduced with a syringe and needle through a septum. The evolved 14CO2 was collected at 30 °C for 1 h. The filter paper was recovered from each reaction tube and radioactivity quantified by liquid scintillation spectrometry. Psd2p activity that is independent of transport processes was measured using NBD-[Ptd1′-14C]Ser as described previously (8Wu W.I. Voelker D.R. J. Biol.

Chem. 1995; 270: 6062-6070Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Measurement of catalytic activity with Ptd[1′-14C]Ser in the presence of detergents routinely gave very low activity, presumably due to detergent-mediated inactivation of the enzyme. The use of a membrane-partitioning substrate, NBD-Ptd[1′-14C]Ser, provided a means to measure Psd2p activity in the absence of detergents (19Trotter P.J. Pedretti J. Yates R. Voelker D.R. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 6390-6398Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Sonicated preparations of Ptd[1′-14C]Ser liposomes routinely proved to be very poor or inactive substrate donors for Psd2p, although biological membranes harboring Ptd[1′-14C]Ser functioned as reasonably good substrates (7Wu W.I.

Chem. 2002; 277: 33720-33726Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). In addition, liposomes prepared from biological membranes that functioned as substrates were also poor substrate donors for the enzyme. We initially sought to understand the discrepancies between biological membranes and liposomes as substrate donors. In preliminary studies, we discovered that large, multilamellar Ptd[1′-14C]Ser liposomes could function as reliable substrates for the enzyme, whereas the activity from small unilamellar Ptd[1′-14C]Ser liposomes was nearly undetectable. From these initial observations, we refined the biochemical assay using Ptd[1′-14C]Ser liposomes of defined size, prepared by the polycarbonate filter extrusion method. Following the refinements of the assay, we returned to the initial comparisons between small unilamellar and large multilamellar vesicles assayed under optimal conditions. These results are presented in Fig. 1 and demonstrate that at a fixed concentration of 0.2 mm PtdSer, there is a 3-fold difference in the activity of the enzyme measured with the multilamellar liposomes, compared with the unilamellar liposomes. This magnitude of difference is likely to be an underestimate, because the multilamellar vesicles have only their outermost lamellar layer of PtdSer available for transfer to the enzyme, whereas the small unilamellar vesicles contain only one phospholipid bilayer. Thus, with the smaller vesicles, there is far more PtdSer available to interact with the acceptor membranes. A direct comparison of unilamellar liposomes of defined diameter, as substrates for the transport reaction, is shown in Fig. 2. These data demonstrate that donor activity varies with vesicle diameter and concentration and that the most efficient substrate donors are liposomes ≥400 nm in size. These findings indicate that membranes with a high degree of curvature are relatively poor substrate donors, whereas relatively planar membranes function more efficiently as substrate donors for Psd2p. This observation is intriguing, since zones of apposition between donor and acceptor membranes observed in micrographs have relatively planar character (13Pichler H. Gaigg B. Hrastnik C.

Unilamellar vesicles of defined size (50–1000 nm) containing Ptd[1′-14C]Ser were prepared using a Liposofast apparatus. The liposomes at 0.1 or 0.2 mm concentration were incubated with acceptor membranes for 20 min at 30 °C and the 14CO2 generated was quantified. Values are means ± S.E. for three experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)PtdSer-rich Membranes Are the Most Efficient Substrate Donors for Psd2p—We next sought to determine whether the surface concentration of PtdSer played an important role in the interaction of the donor and acceptor membranes. Large unilamellar liposomes of 400-nm diameter were prepared from Ptd[1′-14C]Ser and varying amounts of PtdCho ranging from 0 to 50 mol %. These liposomes were incubated with membranes containing Psd2p, and the transport-dependent decarboxylation of PtdSer was measured. From the data in Fig. 3A, it is apparent that the rate of the coupled transport/decarboxylation reaction is dependent upon the concentration of the added lipid. With pure 100 mol % PtdSer liposomes, the rate appears saturable with increasing substrate concentration and gives a hyperbolic initial velocity versus substrate concentration curve. The addition of PtdCho has a dramatic effect upon the initial rate of the reaction. The introduction of 15 mol % PtdCho reduces the initial reaction rate by more than 50%. Further increases in the mol % of PtdCho also appear to have a disproportionate effect upon the function of the donor membranes. Data provided below demonstrate that this is not an inhibitory effect of PtdCho upon the Psd2p but rather appears to be a direct effect on the efficiency of the PtdSer transported to the enzyme. The data shown in Fig. 3B is a replot of the data in Fig. 3A, in which the reaction rate is expressed as a function of the concentration of PtdSer added to the reaction. This form of the data is especially revealing, since it allows for simple comparison of rates among donor liposomes of differing composition but at fixed PtdSer concentration. For example, at 250 μm PtdSer, the difference in rate between liposomes of 100 mol % PtdSer and 50 mol % PtdSer varies by a factor of 20. These data demonstrate that PtdSer transfer to Psd2p occurs at a much higher rate from planar membranes highly enriched in PtdSer when compared with membranes with lower PtdSer content. Fig. 3C is another replot of the data that expresses the transport-dependent decarboxylation of PtdSer as a function of the surface concentration of PtdCho. This analysis of the data demonstrates the differences in rates with respect to the surface concentration of PtdCho and PtdSer at different bulk concentrations of total lipid. The striking decline in transport activity occurs in an exponential manner with respect to the reduction in surface concentration of the PtdSer and corresponding increase in PtdCho. The exponential decline in activity occurs systematically and in parallel for all of the concentrations of total lipid examined in the reaction. These data indicate that the surface concentration of PtdSer is a critical parameter in regulating the transport of this lipid to the locus of Psd2p. In Fig. 3D, the data from Fig. 3B are shown as a double reciprocal plot. This latter treatment of the data demonstrates that the apparent Vmax for the transport-coupled reaction is dramatically affected by reduction in the surface concentration of PtdSer, but the apparent Km of the process is not significantly altered (see inset in Fig. 3D). These kinetic parameters are consistent with the Psd2p being substrate-limited as a consequence of reduced PtdSer transport to the enzyme. Collectively, the information in Fig. 3 supports a mechanism in which PtdSer domains in the donor membrane are recognized by proteins present in the acceptor membrane that transport the substrate to Psd2p.Fig. 3The transport-dependent decarboxylation of PtdSer requires donor membranes containing high concentrations of PtdSer. Unilamellar vesicles of 400-nm diameter were used as substrates for transport-coupled decarboxylation. A shows the rate of PtdSer decarboxylation plotted as a function of total lipid concentration at different mol % composition of liposomes (PtdSer/PtdCho) as indicated. B shows the rate of decarboxylation plotted as a function of PtdSer concentration at different mol % composition of the liposomes (PtdSer/PtdCho) as indicated. C shows the rate of decarboxylation plotted as a function of mol % PtdCho at different total lipid concentrations ranging from 50 to 500 μm. D shows a double reciprocal plot of the data from B for liposomes containing between 60 and 100 mol % PtdSer. Values are means ± S.E. for four experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)PtdSer Transport to Psd2p Is Not Generally Enhanced by Anionic Phospholipids—The preceding data demonstrate that donor membranes highly enriched in PtdSer, efficiently transfer this lipid to Psd2p. We next sought to determine whether this was a general property of anionic lipids or if it was specific only for PtdSer. We utilized liposomes containing 70 mol % PtdSer and 30 mol % of other phospholipids and compared the transport activity with that of 100 mol % PtdSer liposomes. The results of these studies are shown in Fig. 4. As described above, optimal transport-dependent decarboxylation occurred with 100 mol % PtdSer liposomes, and this activity was markedly diminished (∼75%) with liposomes containing 30 mol % PtdCho. Substitution of PtdEtn, phosphatidylglycerol (PtdGro), PtdIns, PtdIns-4-phosphate, and PtdIns-4,5-P2 for PtdCho failed to restore the transport activity to the level of 100 mol % PtdSer. However, there were some modest, reproducible increases in the transport, relative to PtdCho addition, when the added lipid was PtdGro or PtdIns 4-phosphate. When the data are expressed as a percentage of the activity obtained with pure PtdSer vesicles, the added lipids and their corresponding activities are as follows: PtdSer, 100"

We have generated three mutants of ficolin α in which the N-terminal cysteines were substituted by serines (Cys4, Cys24, and Cys4/Cys24). The N-terminal cysteine mutants were produced in a mammalian cell expression system, purified by affinity chromatography, and analyzed under nondenaturing conditions to resolve the multimer structure of the native protein and under denaturing conditions to resolve the disulfide-linked structure. Glycerol gradient sedimentation and electron microscopy in nondenaturing conditions showed that plasma and recombinant wild-type protein formed 12-mers. The Cys4 mutant also formed 12-mers, but Cys24 and Cys4/Cys24 mutants formed only trimers. This means that protein interfaces containing Cys4 are stable as noncovalent protein-protein interactions and do not require disulfides, whereas those containing Cys24-Cys24 require the disulfides for stability. Proteins were also analyzed by nonreducing SDS-PAGE to show the covalent structure under denaturing conditions. Wild-type ficolin was covalently linked into 12-mers, whereas elimination of either Cys4 or Cys24 gave dimers and monomers. We present a model in which symmetric Cys24-Cys24 disulfide bonds between trimers are the basis for multimerization. The model may also be relevant to collectin multimers.

The primary difference between ficolins and collectins is that the C-terminal globular domain of ficolin is a fibrinogen-like (fbg) domain, whereas that of collectins is a carbohydrate recognition domain (12Holmskov U.L. APMIS Suppl. 2000; 100: 1-59PubMed Google Scholar, 13Lu J. Teh C. Kishore U. Reid K.B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1572: 387-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar, 14Crouch E. Wright J.R.

In addition, collectin family proteins have a short α-helical neck region between the collagen and C-terminal domains, whereas ficolins lack this region. The α-helical neck regions of collectins seem to be important for trimerization (27Hakansson K. Lim N.K. Hoppe H.J. Reid K.B. Struct.

Both families of proteins form trimer-based multimers; CL-43 and MBP-C form trimers as the native form, whereas ficolins, conglutinin, MBP-A, and SP-D form tetratrimers (12-mers), and SP-A and C1q form hexatrimers (18-mers) (19Crouch E.

In some cases, larger multimers have been found for ficolin (26Ohashi T. Erickson H.P. J. Biol.

Collectin trimers are linked to each other by disulfide bonds in the N-terminal domain (32Wallis R. Drickamer K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3580-3589Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 33Brown-Augsburger P. Hartshorn K. Chang D. Rust K. Fliszar C. Welgus H.G. Crouch E.C. J. Biol.

Although there is no obvious sequence similarity between the N termini of collectins and ficolins, ficolins also have cysteines that appear to mediate multimerization by disulfide bonding. It is generally accepted that the cysteines in the N-terminal domain mediate multimerization, but the connectivity pattern has not been completely determined for either collectins or ficolins. In the present study, we have used site-directed mutagenesis to determine how the two cysteine residues in the N terminus of ficolin α, Cys4 and Cys24, contribute to multimerization. The pattern of connectivity we determined may be relevant to collectins as well as to ficolins. Mammalian Cell Expression Protein—Ficolin α cDNA (pSVFCα) (1Ichijo H. Hellman U. Wernstedt C.

Chem. 1993; 268: 14505-14513Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), kindly provided by Hidenori Ichijo (Cancer Institute, Japan), was used as template for site-directed mutagenesis (Stratagene). Two sets of oligonucleotides (5′-CCCTCGACACCTCTCCAGAGGTCAAG-3′ and 5′-CCATCCTCCGAGGCTCCCCGGGGCTGCCTGG-3′ and their reverse complements) were designed for generating the Cys4, Cys24, and Cys4/Cys24 double mutants. The mutated cDNAs were cloned into the pEE14 expression vector with the glutamine synthetase gene as a selectable marker (35Bebbington C.R. Hentschel C.C.G. Glover D.M. DNA Cloning. III. IRL Press, Oxford1987: 163-188Google Scholar). The expression vector was transfected into Chinese hamster ovary K1 cells, using Lipofectamine (Invitrogen). The transfected cells were cultured with α-minimal essential medium without glutamine (BioWhittaker) containing 10% dialyzed fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen) and selected in the presence of a glutamine synthetase inhibitor, l-methionine sulfoximine (Sigma). The highest expressing clones were identified by Western blot. The conditioned media from the clones were collected, passed through a GlcNAc-agarose column (Sigma), and eluted with 150 mm GlcNAc in 20 mm Tris buffer containing 150 mm NaCl, pH 8.0 (TBS). However, some mutants did not bind to the GlcNAc column. These inactive mutants were purified with an antibody affinity column as reported previously (26Ohashi T. Erickson H.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14220-14226Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). SDS-PAGE was carried out using standard techniques. Western Blots—Proteins were transferred from the SDS gel to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore) using a semidry electroblotter (Multiphor II; Amersham Biosciences). The membrane was incubated with the polyclonal antibody Ficα4325 (26Ohashi T. Erickson H.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14220-14226Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) at a dilution of 1:2,000 and then with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody at a dilution of 1:1,000 (BIOSOURCE) and stained with diaminobenzidine, H2O2, and NiCl2. Estimation of Sedimentation Coefficient and Electron Microscopy— Sedimentation coefficients were estimated by glycerol gradient sedimentation. The samples were sedimented at 20 °C on 15–40% glycerol gradients in 0.2 m ammonium bicarbonate at 38,000 rpm for 16 h in a Beckman SW-55.1 rotor. The glycerol gradients were calibrated with standard proteins of known s values (catalase, 11.3 S; aldolase, 7.3 S; bovine serum albumin, 4.6 S; chymotrypsinogen, 2.6 S). For rotary shadowing, purified ficolin from a glycerol gradient was sprayed onto freshly cleaved mica, dried under vacuum, and rotary-shadowed with platinum (36Fowler W.E. Erickson H.P. J. Mol. Biol. 1979; 134: 241-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Reduction, Reoxidation, and Trypsin Treatment—Recombinant wild-type ficolin at 0.5 mg/ml was reduced with 50 mm dithiothreitol (DTT) for1hat room temperature. For reoxidation, the reduced proteins were dialyzed against TBS containing 1 mm reduced glutathione and 0.3 mm oxidized glutathione for 24–36 h at room temperature. In order to block free cysteine, some reduced samples were dialyzed against TBS containing 10 mm iodoacetamide for 24–36 h at room temperature. Samples were further dialyzed against TBS for 24–36 h at room temperature to remove reagents. For estimation of the sedimentation coefficient of the reduced ficolin, 1 mm DTT was added to the glycerol gradient to prevent reoxidation. Recombinant wild-type ficolin at 0.5 mg/ml was digested with trypsin at 0.1 mg/ml for2hat room temperature, and the digestion was quenched with 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Protease digestion is often used to evaluate the stability of a collagen triple-helical structure (37Olsen D.R. Leigh S.D. Chang R. McMullin H. Ong W. Tai E. Chisholm G. Birk D.E. Berg R.A. Hitzeman R.A. Toman P.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 24038-24043Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The recombinant wild-type ficolin was purified by GlcNAc affinity chromatography (Fig. 1A). Less than 10% of the ficolin in the conditioned medium bound to the GlcNAc column, so this purification selected for the small fraction of active protein. Unlike in plasma ficolin purification (26Ohashi T. Erickson H.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14220-14226Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), no obvious contaminating protein was detected in this one-step preparation. We did not detect any ficolin in fetal bovine serum by GlcNAc affinity chromatography and Western blot prior to this study, suggesting that the fetal serum may have low levels of ficolin. The recombinant ficolin always showed doublets in SDS-PAGE and on Western blots. Treatment with N-glycosidase indicated that the upper band was N-glycosylated, whereas the lower band was not (Fig. 1B). The Cys4 mutants were also purified with a GlcNAc column. However, Cys24 and Cys4/Cys24 mutants did not bind to the GlcNAc column. They were purified by antibody affinity chromatography as reported previously (26Ohashi T. Erickson H.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14220-14226Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Fig. 2 shows purified ficolin on a Western blot under nonreducing conditions. The plasma and recombinant wild-type ficolin migrated mainly as monomers and 12-mers with a small fraction migrating as tetramers, hexamers, and 8-mers (Fig. 2, lanes 1 and 2). This demonstrates that the recombinant wild-type ficolin is covalently cross-linked by disulfide bonds, but the presence of smaller multimers suggests that some of the interchain disulfide linkages are not formed, as found previously for plasma ficolin (26Ohashi T. Erickson H.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14220-14226Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). A small fraction of protein migrated above 12-mers, suggesting that ficolin is able to form covalently linked larger multimers. The Cys4 mutant migrated primarily as monomers and dimers, with a small and decreasing fraction of higher multimers, up to some 12-mers (Fig. 2, lane 3). Some of the intermediate multimers ran in different positions from those of the wild-type protein. The Cys24 mutants showed monomeric and dimeric forms and a small fraction of tetramers (Fig. 2, lane 4). The Cys4/Cys24 mutant showed a similar pattern but with an apparently much larger monomeric pool (Fig. 2, lane 5). Note that the minor bands described here are mostly invisible on Coomassie Blue-stained SDS gels. Because only 10% of the recombinant wild-type ficolin bound to the GlcNAc column, we were concerned that this column might be selecting for disulfide-bonded multimers. We therefore checked the disulfide bonding pattern of protein in conditioned media by Western blotting (Fig. 2D). For both the wild-type and mutant proteins, the pattern was identical to that of the proteins purified by GlcNAc or antibody affinity chromatography. This suggests that the lack of GlcNAc binding of the recombinant wild-type ficolin is not due to incomplete disulfide bond multimerization. Samples were analyzed by glycerol gradient sedimentation to determine the sedimentation coefficients. Results for all proteins are given in Table I, and individual examples are shown in Fig. 3. Purified recombinant wild-type ficolin sedimented as a sharp peak at 11.7 S (Fig. 3A) the same as plasma ficolin 12-mers (note that the majority of plasma ficolin forms 24-mers and sediments at 19.5 S) (26Ohashi T. Erickson H.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14220-14226Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The Cys4 mutant showed a similar s value of 11.3, suggesting that it forms 12-mers despite the altered disulfide bond formation (Fig. 2). On the other hand, the Cys24 mutant sedimented at 4.5 S, suggesting that it forms only trimers. The Cys4/Cys24 mutant sedimented at 4.7 S, essentially the same as Cys24 (Fig. 3B). In Table I, we have calculated an smax/s for each protein based on the above size estimate. They all have the same value of about 1.7, characteristic of a moderately elongated protein (38Schürmann G. Haspel J. Grumet M. Erickson H.P. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 1765-1773Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar).Table IEstimated molecular masses for recombinant ficolinsProteinMolecular massssmax/saThe ratio of maximum sedimentation coefficient, calculated for an unhydrated sphere of protein of the same mass, to the measured sedimentation coefficientkDaNative ficolinbThe molecular weight for native ficolin has been reported previously (26)420 (12-mer)121.7Recombinant ficolin420 (12-mer)11.71.7Cys4-substituted mutant420 (12-mer)11.31.8Cys24-substituted mutant105 (trimer)4.51.8Cys4/Cys24-substituted mutant105 (trimer)4.71.7Reduced ficolin105 (trimer)4.61.7Reoxidized ficolin420 (12-mer)11.31.8Trypsin-digested ficolin420 (12-mer)11.71.7a The ratio of maximum sedimentation coefficient, calculated for an unhydrated sphere of protein of the same mass, to the measured sedimentation coefficientb The molecular weight for native ficolin has been reported previously (26Ohashi T.

Reduced ficolin sedimented at 4.6 S (Fig. 4A). Samples from the gradient ran as monomers on nonreducing SDS-PAGE, which was expected, since the gradient contained DTT. To determine the extent of reduction, we treated a sample with iodoacetamide and dialyzed away the DTT. This sample migrated as monomers on SDS-PAGE (data not shown), indicating that the intersubunit disulfides were fully reduced. The multimeric structure could be fully restored by reoxidizing the reduced ficolin with a mixture of reduced and oxidized glutathione. The reoxidized ficolin sedimented at 11.3 S and migrated as 12-mers and monomers in SDS-PAGE under nonreducing conditions (Fig. 4B), the same as wild-type ficolin (Fig. 4C). We also examined the effect of mild trypsin digestion on ficolin structure. The trypsin-digested ficolin sedimented at 11.7 S and migrated as monomers and dimers in SDS-PAGE (Fig. 4D). This is the same as the Cys4 mutants (Fig. 2 and Table I), which suggests that trypsin digestion eliminates the Cys4-mediated disulfide linkages. Trypsin probably digests the carboxyl side of Lys8, because the digestion produced no obvious molecular weight shift in SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions (data not shown). Electron microscopy of rotary-shadowed recombinant wild-type ficolin showed parachute-like structures (Fig. 5A), the same as plasma ficolin 12-mers reported previously (26Ohashi T. Erickson H.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14220-14226Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The small glob at the bottom of the parachute consists of the associated N-terminal domains, and the parachute itself contains the four trimers of the C-terminal fbg domains. The thin, elongated collagen domains between the N- and C-terminal domains are mostly invisible in rotary-shadowed images. Approximately 9% of molecules (35 of 396) showed disrupted parachute-like structures (Fig. 5F). Larger multimers that seemed linked at the N terminus were infrequently seen (<1%), and some showed bouquet-like structures (Fig. 5G). These larger multimers linked at the N terminus had not been seen in plasma ficolin (26Ohashi T. Erickson H.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14220-14226Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), suggesting that it may be due to the overexpression of ficolin in the mammalian cell expression system. On the contrary, 24-mers linked at the C-terminal domains, which were seen in plasma ficolin (26Ohashi T. Erickson H.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14220-14226Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), were rarely observed in the recombinant protein (Fig. 5H). This result is consistent with the estimated sedimentation coefficients (Table I). The Cys4 mutant showed parachute-like structures identical to wild-type ficolin (Fig. 5B), confirming the suggestion from sedimentation that it forms normal 12-mers. The Cys4/Cys24 mutant showed lollipop-like structures (Fig. 5C), consistent with individual trimers. In these trimeric forms, the collagen domains are clearly seen. The N-terminal globs are almost invisible, although in some cases they appear as tiny globs (Fig. 5I). We were unable to visualize the Cys24 mutant by EM, due to the low concentration of purified protein. These EM images agree with the multimeric structures estimated in Table I. Electron microscopy of the reduced ficolin showed dumbbell-like or V-shaped structures (Fig. 5D), which we interpret as being two trimers connected at their N-terminal domains. Some proteins also revealed trimeric lollipop-like structures similar to the Cys4/Cys24 mutants. Interestingly, the estimated sedimentation coefficient 4.6 S of the reduced ficolin is identical to that of the Cys4/Cys24 substitute mutants that showed a trimeric form in EM. We suggest that the reduced ficolin shows a weak tendency to associate at the N-terminal domain but that this is blocked by the hydrostatic pressure during sedimentation. When the pressure is reduced following sedimentation, the trimers reassociate. This effect has been reported in gradient sedimentation of tubulin (39Erickson H.P. J. Supramol. Struct. 1974; 2: 393-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) and FtsZ (40Lu C.L. Reedy M. Erickson H.P. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 164-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). The reoxidized and trypsin-digested ficolin showed parachute-like structures (Fig. 5E), the same as recombinant wild-type ficolin (Fig. 5, A and B). We also attempted to measure the number of free sulfhydryls in the recombinant wild-type ficolin by DTNB assay (41Ellman G.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1959; 82: 70-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (21618) Google Scholar). Free cysteine and fibronectin type III domains 7–10 (FN7–10) (42Aukhil I. Joshi P. Yan Y. Erickson H.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2542-2553Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) were used as positive controls. FN7–10 has a single sulfhydryl, which was detectable in the presence of urea or guanidine HCl, as reported previously (43Mosher D.F. Johnson R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 6595-6601Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). On the other hand, we did not detect any free sulfhydryl in the recombinant wild-type ficolin, even in the presence of urea or guanidine HCl (data not shown). These measurements were able to detect sulfhydryls at a concentration of 2–3 μm, so at the protein concentrations we had available we could detect one free sulfhydryl per subunit, but we would not have detected ∼2–4 free sulfhydryls per 12-mer. A small fraction of recombinant wild-type and Cys4 mutant ficolin bound the GlcNAc column, but the Cys24 and Cys4/Cys24 mutants did not bind at all. Since the inactive mutants are trimers, it seems that efficient binding to the GlcNAc column may require assembly into the 12-mer. The simplest explanation might be that binding GlcNAc is very weak, and binding to the column requires multivalent attachment. However, this is contradicted by the observation that individual fbg domains, expressed in bacteria and renatured, showed some binding (16Teh C. Le Y. Lee S.H. Lu J. Immunology. 2000; 101: 225-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). 2T. Ohashi and H. P. Erickson, unpublished observation. In addition, we are unable to explain why the majority of recombinant wild-type ficolin did not bind the GlcNAc column. The GlcNAc binding activity may involve a conformational change of the fbg domain that is not well controlled in our system. The Cys4/Cys24-substituted mutants showed a small amount of dimeric and tetrameric forms on nonreducing gels, suggesting that two more cysteine residues are able to form interchain disulfide bonds. The Cys4/Cys24-substituted mutants still have six cysteine residues in the C-terminal fbg domain. Presumably, Cys89, Cys117, Cys241, and Cys254 form intrachain disulfide bonds, because they are well conserved in all fbg modules. The DTNB assay showed no exposed sulfhydryls, suggesting that the two other cysteines (Cys82 and Cys110) are either buried or form a disulfide bond. The atomic structures of fibrinogen γ and tachylectin 5A (44Yee V.C. Pratt K.P. Côté H.C.F. Le Trong I. Chung D.W. Davie E.W. Stenkamp R.E. Teller D.C. Structure. 1997; 5: 125-138Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar, 45Kairies N. Beisel H.G. Fuentes-Prior P. Tsuda R. Muta T. Iwanaga S. Bode W. Huber R. Kawabata S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 13519-13524Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar) show that the positions of residues 82 and 110 may be close enough to form intrachain disulfide bonds, although fibrinogen γ and tachylectin 5A do not have cysteine residues at these positions. If the six cysteine residues are all engaged in intrachain disulfides, the observation of a small fraction of dimers and tetramers may be due to disulfide exchange. Since the majority of Cys4/Cys24 protein ran as monomers on nonreducing gels, we conclude that disulfide bonding between fbg domains contributes very little to the covalent structure of ficolin. Hence, the cysteine residues in the N-terminal domain appear to be the major players in intermolecular disulfide bonds in ficolin. This is consistent with collectin multimerization in which all interchain disulfide bonds are formed in the N-terminal domains (32Wallis R. Drickamer K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3580-3589Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 33Brown-Augsburger P. Hartshorn K. Chang D. Rust K. Fliszar C. Welgus H.G. Crouch E.C. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 7018-7025Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). When SP-A was reduced in nondenaturing conditions, it separated into trimers, and these did not reassociate when reoxidized (46Haas C. Voss T. Engel J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 197: 799-803Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). When ficolin was reduced, it also separated into trimers and hexamers as shown in Fig. 5D. When the reduced ficolin was reoxidized, however, it was able to reform 12-mers. This demonstrates that at least some disulfide bonds between trimers are essential for stabilizing the 12-mer structure. Our mutant analysis suggests that Cys24 is essential for 12-mer formation but that Cys4 is dispensable, since the Cys4 mutant and trypsin-digested ficolin showed the 12-mer structure. It is important to note that this 12-mer structure refers to that in solution, under nondenaturing conditions, where noncovalent protein-protein interactions may suffice to hold subunits together. The interfaces that contain Cys24-Cys24 contacts apparently require the disulfide linkages to be stable. However, the subunit interfaces containing the Cys4-Cys4 and Cys4-Cys24 disulfides are apparently stable as noncovalent protein-protein bonds and do not require the disulfides. A model for the disulfide linkages in ficolin multimers is suggested in Fig. 6. We suggest that two of the Cys24 residues in each trimer form disulfide bonds to Cys24 in adjacent trimers. These bonds would link four trimers with 4-fold symmetry (Fig. 6B). We postulate that the third Cys24 forms a bond to a Cys4 within the trimer. If the remaining two Cys4 residues form a disulfide bond within the trimer, the 12 subunits would all be covalently connected. Note that if one bond were missing, there would still be a linear 12-mer, but if two or more were missing, the multimers would be smaller. The high fraction of 12-mers seen in nonreducing SDS-PAGE of plasma or recombinant ficolin suggests that most disulfides are efficiently formed. This model is also consistent with the nonreducing gel results for our mutants (Fig. 2). If one eliminates Cys4 in the model, the remaining Cys24-Cys24 links will give only dimers, and one-third of the chains will be left as monomers. The nonreducing gel (Fig. 2) shows primarily dimer and monomer, with approximately twice as much protein in the dimer band. The model explains a similar pattern for the Cys24 mutant. Again, the nonreducing gel shows almost exclusively dimer and monomer, although there appears to be an excess of monomer. This may mean that in the Cys24 mutant, some of the Cys4-Cys4 bonds are not formed. This speculation may be extended to the wild-type protein, to explain the rather abundant monomers. These monomers must be subunits that have formed no disulfide. We suggest that a fraction of subunits fail to form a disulfide with Cys24 and that this may block disulfide bonding of Cys4 of the same subunit. The lack of symmetry in disulfide bonding within the trimer has a well established precedent in CL-43 and MBP-C. These collectins form trimers but not higher multimers, and the two cysteines in each chain are fully engaged in disulfide bonds. In CL-43, there were three different disulfide links: Cys15-Cys15, Cys15-Cys20, and Cys20-Cys20 (47Rothmann A.B. Mortensen H.D. Holmskov U. Hojrup P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 243: 630-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Wallis and Drickamer (31Wallis R. Drickamer K. Biochem. J. 1997; 325: 391-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) deduced a similar asymmetric linkage for MBP-C (Cys11-Cys11, Cys16-Cys16, and Cys11-Cys16) and presented the important argument that one should not expect a symmetric arrangement, because the molecule does not have 3-fold symmetry. The collagen molecule has a 3-fold screw axis, in which the three chains are staggered. It is therefore not surprising to find an asymmetric bonding pattern in the N-terminal domain of collectins and ficolins, since the collagen imposes a break from rotational symmetry. MBP-A has three cysteines in its N-terminal domain. Two of these (Cys13 and Cys18) are involved in forming cross-links within a trimer, and Cys6 mediates association of trimers into multimers of 1–4 trimers (32Wallis R. Drickamer K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3580-3589Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). MBP-A Cys6 is thus similar to Cys24 of ficolin. Only one or two of the three Cys6 residues per trimer could participate in bonding between trimers. Since no free cysteine was detected, the remaining Cys6 is probably bonded internally to Cys13 or Cys18. SP-A has only a single universal cysteine (Cys6) in its N-terminal domain, although about 20% of the chains have an N-terminal extension with an additional cysteine at position -1. Elhalwagi et al. (34Elhalwagi B.M. Damodarasamy M. McCormack F.X. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 7018-7025Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) have proposed that Cys6 forms disulfide bonds both within and between trimers. In their model, two of the three cysteines formed disulfides within the trimer. However, this would leave only one cysteine to form disulfide bonds between trimers, which would not form multimers larger than dimers of trimers. We would suggest that Cys6 is primarily involved in symmetric bonding between trimers, similar to Cys24 in our model for ficolin. This would leave one chain in each trimer without a disulfide bond, which is consistent with the published gel results (34Elhalwagi B.M. Damodarasamy M. McCormack F.X. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 7018-7025Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The collectins and ficolins thus seem to have in common the use of a single cysteine in the N-terminal domain to cross-link the trimers into multimers. In a closed circular structure, these disulfides between trimers utilize two of the three cysteines, with the third one either unbonded or bonding to another cysteine within the trimer. In addition, most of these molecules have a second cysteine that forms disulfides within each trimer. A remarkable feature of the ficolin multimerization is that it can be reversibly altered by reducing and reoxidizing the disulfide bonds. Whereas the structure of the trimer is maintained by the noncovalent bonding within the collagen helix, association between trimers is highly dependent on disulfide bonds. The assembly of subunits first into trimers, followed by association into multimers, which are finally stabilized by disulfides, is probably the pathway of assembly in the rough endoplasmic reticulum."
https://openalex.org/W2051697670,"The metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs) are G-protein-coupled receptors involved in the regulation of glutamatergic synapses. Surprisingly, the evolution-arily distant Drosophila mGluR shares a very similar pharmacological profile with its mammalian orthologues (mGlu2R and mGlu3R). Such a conservation in ligand recognition indicates a strong selective pressure during evolution to maintain the ligand recognition selectivity of mGluRs and suggests that structural constraints within the ligand binding pocket (LBP) would hinder divergent evolution. Here we report the identification of a new receptor homologous to mGluRs found in Anopheles gambiae, Apis mellifera, and Drosophila melanogaster genomes and called AmXR, HBmXR, and DmXR, respectively (the mXRs group). Sequence comparison associated with three-dimensional modeling of the LBP revealed that the residues contacting the amino acid moiety of glutamate (the α-COO- and NH3+ groups) were conserved in mXRs, whereas the residues interacting with the γ-carboxylic group were not. This suggested that the mXRs evolved to recognize an amino acid different from glutamate. The Drosophila cDNA encoding DmXR was isolated and found to be insensitive to glutamate or any other standard amino acid.

We found that the DmX receptor was activated by a ligand containing an amino group, which was extracted from Drosophila head and from other insects (Anopheles and Schistocerca).

Sensory and intercellular communications in the animal kingdom are often mediated by seven transmembrane G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) 1The abbreviations used are: GPCRs, G-protein-coupled receptors; mGluR, metabotropic glutamate receptor; DmGluAR, Drosophila metabotropic glutamate receptor A; LBP, ligand binding pocket; VFTM, Venus Flytrap module; mXR, metabotropic X receptor; AmXR, Anopheles mXR; HBmXR, Apis mXR; DmXR, Drosophila mXR; HEK, human embryonic kidney; IP, inositol trisphosphate; V1ahR, Vasopressine1a human receptor; GABAB receptor, γ-aminobutyric acid type B receptor; AVP, arginine vasopressin; RT, reverse transcriptase; HA, hemagglutinin. and their ligands. GPCRs are activated by a wide variety of ligands (light, ions, neurotransmitters, odors, and hormones) and have evolved as one of the largest gene superfamilies (1Bockaert J. Pin J.-P. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1723-1729Crossref PubMed Scopus (1233) Google Scholar). Pharmacological characterization of GPCRs phylogenetically related shows that the ligand recognition site has diverged during evolution. Generally, related receptors from different species recognize the same endogenous ligands but have different pharmacological profiles when one is considering synthetic ligands. In some cases, the divergence is so important that related receptors recognize different endogenous ligands (2Broeck J.V. Arch. Insect Biochem. Physiol. 2001; 48: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). However, such pharmacological divergences, as far as currently known, did not occur in the metabotropic glutamate receptor (mGluRs) subclass of GPCRs. The eight mammalian mGluRs (mGlu1R to mGlu8R) are involved in the regulation of many glutamatergic excitatory synapses (3Conn P. Pin J.-P. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1997; 37: 205-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (2736) Google Scholar, 4Schoepp D.D. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2001; 299: 12-20PubMed Google Scholar). They are classified into three groups based on their sequence homology, ligand recognition selectivity, and transduction pathway. Sequence analysis of the Caenorhabditis elegans genome revealed the presence of one homologue for each group (5Pin J.-P. Acher F. Curr. Drug Targets CNS Neurol. Disord. 2002; 1: 297-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar), indicating that the three groups of mGluRs were already present in the common ancestor of nematodes and vertebrates. Functional data were obtained with the Drosophila melanogaster metabotropic glutamate receptor (DmGluAR) (6Parmentier M.L. Pin J.P. Bockaert J. Grau Y. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 6687-6694Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Surprisingly its pharmacological profile was conserved, DmGluAR being activated or inhibited by the same natural and synthetic ligands as its mammalian mGluR orthologues (the group II mGluRs, mGlu2R and mGlu3R) (7Parmentier M.L. Joly C. Restituito S. Bockaert J. Grau Y. Pin J.P. Mol. Pharmacol. 1998; 53: 778-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Such a conservation in the ligand recognition between invertebrates and mammalians mGluRs, for the endogenous ligand and for different synthetic ligands, suggests the existence of structural constraints within the ligand binding pocket (LBP) or even in the whole ligand binding domain, called the Venus Flytrap module (VFTM) in mGluRs (8Abele R. Svergun D. Keinanen K. Koch M.H. Madden D.R. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 10949-10957Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). These constraints would hinder further divergent evolution of the LBP. Here we show that a strong divergence of the LBP and of the endogenous ligand has occurred during evolution. Indeed, we describe the identification of a new receptor belonging to the mGluR subclass. This receptor was found in the Anopheles, Apis, and Drosophila genomes and was called mXR (AmXR, HBmXR (for honeybee), and DmXR, respectively). We isolated the Drosophila cDNA encoding DmXR. Comparison between the LBP sequence of mGluRs and mXRs associated with three-dimensional modeling of the LBP revealed that only part of the residues involved in the binding of glutamate was conserved, suggesting that these receptors evolved to recognize an amino acid different from glutamate. We demonstrate that the DmXR could not be activated by glutamate but was activated by a compound with a primary amino group, found in extracts from Drosophila heads and from others insects (Anopheles gambiae and Schistocerca gregaria). No orthologue of this new receptor could be found in C. elegans and mammalian genomes. Our data show that the existence of receptor ligand-specific constraints cannot be generalized to the entire subclass of mGluRs. Moreover, in at least some insects, one mGluR has diverged to be activated by a new endogenous ligand. Materials—All l-amino acids and d-aspartate, d-glutamate, d-serine, d-alanine, taurine, carnosine, and trichloroacetic acid were purchased from Sigma. l-Quisqualate, γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA), N-acetylaspartylglutamate, l-cysteinesulfonic acid, α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid, kainate, N-methyl-d-aspartate, and l-2-amino-4-phosphonobutyric acid were purchased from Tocris Neuramin (Bristol, UK). Glutamate pyruvate transaminase was from Roche Applied Science. Fetal bovine serum, culture medium, and other solutions used for cell culture were from Invitrogen. [3H]Myoinositol was purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Cloning of the DmX Receptor and in Vitro Mutagenesis—DmXR cDNAs with incomplete 5′ end were obtained after screening a Drosophila wild-type Oregon R head library as in Ref. 6Parmentier M.L. Pin J.P. Bockaert J. Grau Y. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 6687-6694Crossref PubMed Google Scholar. These cDNAs were first called DmGluBR (corresponding to CG30361, Flybase) (9Consortium Flybase Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 106-108Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). All the cDNAs had the same sequence corresponding to nucleotides coding for residue 336 to the last residue in Fig. 1A followed by a 265-bp 3′-untranslated sequence. The missing N-terminal part of the DmXR was cloned by RT-PCR from Drosophila Oregon R heads using the sense primer BC522 (5′-ACAACATGAACCTAATGCTGCC-3′) and the antisense primer 6V (5′-CACTGAAAGTGATCCTCC-3′). Several independent clones were sequenced in their entire length in order to verify the correctness of the amplification by comparison to the DmXR genomic sequence. The full-length coding sequence was assembled in pBS plasmid (Stratagene), and the sequence was verified by sequencing. The entire coding sequence was subcloned in the mammalian expression vector pRK5 and tagged N-terminally with the hemagglutinin epitope (HA-DmXR/pRK5) as in Ref. 10Ango F. Albani-Torregrossa S.

The chimeric receptor that contains the extracellular domain of DmGluAR and the 7TM and C-terminal regions of DmXR was constructed with the PCR overlap extension method using DmGluRA and DmXR as template. The choice of the limits of the different domains was done as in Ref. 7Parmentier M.L. Joly C. Restituito S. Bockaert J. Grau Y. Pin J.P. Mol. Pharmacol. 1998; 53: 778-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar. For all constructs, the sequences were verified using the appropriate primers and the “dNA sequencer, Long Readir 4200 LiCOR” from Sciencetec. For the construction of the mutant receptors, amino acid changes in the DmXR LBP were introduced using the PCR overlap extension method as described previously (11Pin J.-P. Joly C. Heinemann S.F. Bockaert J. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 342-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar) for the tagged HA-DmXR/pRK5 plasmid. The presence of each mutation of interest and the absence of undesired ones were confirmed by sequencing. The resulting expression constructs were used for transient expression in human embryonic kidney (HEK 293) cells. Cell Culture, Transfection, and Inositol Phosphate (IP) Assay—HEK 293 cells were cultured as described in Ref. 12Bessis A.-S. Rondard P. Gaven F. Brabet I. Triballeau N. Prézeau L. Acher F. Pin J.-P.

Determination of IP accumulation in transfected cells was performed after labeling the cells overnight with [3H]myoinositol (23.4Ci/mol) as described previously (15Kniazeff J. Galvez T. Labesse G. Pin J.-P. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 7352-7361Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Imunocytochemistry—HEK 293 cells were grown on 8-well glass slides coated with poly-d-lysine and transfected (2 μg of HA-DmX/pRK5 or 2 μg of HA mutant DmXR/pRK5). The immunocytochemistry was performed as described previously (13Conklin B.R. Farfel Z. Lustig K.D. Julius D. Bourne H.R. Nature. 1993; 363: 274-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (615) Google Scholar). Cell-surface receptor expression was assayed by labeling with anti-HA monoclonal mouse 12CA5 antibody for 2 h at 1.3 μg/ml in phosphate-buffered saline/gelatin (0.2%), as described previously (15Kniazeff J. Galvez T. Labesse G. Pin J.-P. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 7352-7361Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). RT-PCR Experiments—Drosophila poly(A)+ mRNA was used with the One-step RT-PCR PLATINIUM Taq kit (Invitrogen). DmXR sense primer was XRY2 (5′-TGT ATT GCC ATC AAG GAG AAG-3′) and antisense primer was 6V. PCR products of the expected size (380 bp) were sequenced. Positive control reactions were set up in parallel using phosphoglycerate kinase sense primer 5′-GGC CAA GAA GAA TAA CGT GCA GTT GC-3′ and phosphoglycerate kinase antisense primer 5′-CGC TGG TCA ATG CAC GCA CGC-3′ that amplified a fragment of 430 bp (16Roselli-Rehfuss L. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1992; 235: 213-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Protocol of Amino Acid Extraction—We harvested Drosophila heads or others tissues frozen in liquid nitrogen. The tissues were weighed, ground, and sonicated. To separate DNA and membranes from small molecules, a first centrifugation was performed 15 min at 10,000 × g. Proteins precipitation was then performed by treating the supernatant with 10% trichloroacetic acid, to a final concentration of 5% for at least 2 h at 4 °C (17Miks B. Folia Histochem. Cytochem. 1975; 13: 77-84PubMed Google Scholar). The extracts were then submitted to a 30-min centrifugation at 38,000 × g. The supernatant was recovered, evaporated, and dissolved in HEPES saline buffer. The pH was adjusted to 7.4 by adding NaOH. The final concentration was about 40 μg of tissues/μl. In the pharmacological assays, 1× corresponds to the amount obtained with 2 mg of tissues. Sequences Analysis and Molecular Modeling—The sequence alignment between the rat mGlu1R, the Drosophila DmGluAR, and the three mXRs was produced using ClustalW and the default parameters (18Thompson J.D. Higgins D.G. Gibson T.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4673-4680Crossref PubMed Scopus (56002) Google Scholar). The inferred amino acid sequences of class III GPCRs from rat, Drosophila, and Anopheles were obtained from Swiss Protein, Flybase, and NCBI data banks, respectively. The AmXR sequence (AAAB01008900) was deduced from Anopheles gambiae genome using TblastN (19Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schaffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (60233) Google Scholar) and the DmXR sequence. The HBmXR sequence was deduced from Apis mellifera genome sequence (Baylor College of Medicine) using TblastN (19Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schaffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (60233) Google Scholar) and the DmXR sequence. The phylogenetic tree was constructed using an exhaustive number of class III GPCR sequences from various species retrieved from data banks using TblastN searches (see Fig. 2). Sequences were aligned using the default parameters of ClustalW (protein weight matrix, Blosum30; Gap open penalty, 10.0; Gap extension penalty, 0.1). The resulting multialignment was then used for construction of an evolutionary tree using the Neighbor Joining method (20Saitou N. Nei M. Mol. Biol. Evol. 1987; 4: 406-425PubMed Google Scholar), and the positions with gaps were excluded. Bootstrap values were calculated using 1000 trials and a seed number of 111. The unrooted tree was then drawn from the .phb file using TreeView (21Page R.D.M. Comput. Appl. Biosci. 1996; 12: 357-358PubMed Google Scholar). A homology model of the closed form of the VFTM of DmXR was generated using the x-ray crystal structure of the VFTM of rat mGlu1R as a template (Protein Data Bank accession number 1EWKA). The three-dimensional model was built by using Modeler 5 (22Sali A. Blundell T.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 234: 779-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (10636) Google Scholar) in the Insight-II environment (Accelrys, San Diego) as described previously (23Galvez T. Prézeau L. Milioti G. Franek M. Joly C.

Chem. 2000; 275: 41166-41174Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar), based on the alignment shown in Fig. 1. The Verify3D plots (24Eisenberg D. Luthy R. Bowie J.U. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 277: 396-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (1679) Google Scholar) were generated using Profile3D in the Insight-II environment. Anopheles, Apis, and Drosophila mX Receptors Are New Homologues of mGluRs with a Divergent LBP—We identified a new receptor homologous to mGluRs, called mXR, in genomic sequences from A. gambiae, A. mellifera, and D. melanogaster using TblastN searches against all genomic sequences available at NCBI, with the complete sequence of mammalian mGluRs as a probe. In order to make sure that these sequences were actually transcribed, we cloned the cDNA encoding the Drosophila receptor (DmXR), as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The DmXR sequence is shown in Fig. 1 as well as the sequence of the Anopheles (AmXR) and Apis (HBmXR) receptors deduced from the genome sequence. The mXRs (AmXR, HBmXR, and DmXR) displayed about 75% sequence identity between themselves, indicating that they encode orthologous insect receptors. A direct comparison between amino acid sequences of the mXRs and members of the mGluRs subclass (DmGluAR and mGlu1bR in Fig. 1) revealed that all the structural features characteristic of mGluRs were conserved. The mGluRs share sequence similarity with the GABAB receptors, the calcium-sensing receptor, some taste receptors, and a class of mammalian putative pheromone receptors and constitute the class III within the large GPCR family (1Bockaert J. Pin J.-P. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1723-1729Crossref PubMed Scopus (1233) Google Scholar). The sequence of the seven-transmembrane domain of mXRs displayed 32–40% overall amino acid identity with the mGluRs and only 17–25% with the other members of the class III receptors, suggesting that the mXRs are part of the mGluR subclass. To further analyze this, a multialignment of mXRs and many other members of the class III GPCRs from various species was generated and used to generate a phylogenetic tree (Fig. 2). This analysis was restricted to members of the class III GPCRs containing both the ligand binding domain and the seven-transmembrane domain. This analysis clearly revealed three main subclasses of ligand binding domain-containing class III GPCRs, as indicated with bootstrap values for the branches defining these groups of 1000, 988, and 1000 (Fig. 2). These subclasses correspond to the mGlu receptors, the sensory receptors, and the GABAB receptor subunits, respectively. The DmXR, AmXR, and HBmXR sequences are clearly part of the mGlu receptors subclass but define a group different from the group I, II, and III mGluRs, and each of these groups was defined by bootstrap values of 1000 (887 for the group II if the DmGluAR sequence is included). The same conclusion was obtained when the phylogenetic tree was calculated without excluding positions with gaps or when only the sequences of the 7TM domain of all class III GPCRs (even those not containing a known ligand binding domain) were used for the analysis. Taken together these observations demonstrate the mXRs derive from an ancestral mGlu receptor. However, all three identified mXR sequences differed from all other mGluRs at the level of some key residues involved in glutamate binding, suggesting that they are not activated by this acidic amino acid. Previous mutagenesis and modeling studies as well as data obtained from the crystallization of the mGlu1R VFTM identified several key residues involved in the binding of glutamate (25O’Hara P.J. Sheppard P.O. Thøgersen H. Venezia D. Haldeman B.A. McGrane V. Houamed K.M. Thomsen C. Gilbert T.L. Mulvihill E.R.

Nature. 2000; 407: 971-977Crossref PubMed Scopus (1118) Google Scholar). All these are conserved among all mGluRs, including the Drosophila receptor DmGluAR (Fig. 1) and the C. elegans mGluR homologues (5Pin J.-P. Acher F. Curr. Drug Targets CNS Neurol. Disord. 2002; 1: 297-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar), except mXRs. In mGlu1R, Ser-165 and Thr-188 on one hand and Asp-208, Tyr-236, and Asp-318 on the other hand are involved in the binding of the α-carboxylic and α-amino groups of glutamate, respectively. In addition Arg-78 and Lys-409 (in mGlu1R) are involved in the binding of the γ-carboxylic group of glutamate (Fig. 1 and Fig. 3). In mXRs, the residues that directly contact the α-carboxylic (Ser-153 and Thr-176 in DmXR) and the α-amino groups (Asp-196, Tyr-224, and Asp-308 in DmXR) of glutamate were all conserved (Fig. 1 and Fig. 3). However, the residues interacting with the γ-carboxylic group of glutamate (Arg-78 and Lys-409 in mGlu1R) were not conserved in the mXRs. The homologous residues in mXRs were Ala (77 in DmXR) and Gln (401 in DmXR), respectively (Figs. 1 and 3). Previous mutagenesis experiments have shown that Arg-78 is required for a high affinity binding of glutamate to mGlu1R (27Jensen A.A. Sheppard P.O. O’Hara P.J. Krogsgaard-Larsen P. Bräuner-Osborne H. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 2000; 397: 247-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Therefore, the replacement of an Arg residue by Ala in mXRs suggested that these receptors were not glutamate receptors. The Venus Flytrap Module of DmXR Can Adopt the Same Structure as the Venus Flytrap Module of mGlu1R—In order to verify the hypothesis that these new receptors could not bind glutamate, we tested whether the VFTM of DmXR could lead to a three-dimensional structure similar to the mGlu1R VFTM, with the residues involved in the binding of the α-amino and α-carboxylic groups of amino acids in a correct position. A three-dimensional model of the VFTM of DmXR was generated using the coordinates of the mGlu1R VFTM structure as template (1ewk:A) (26Kunishima N. Shimada Y. Tsuji Y. Sato T. Yamamoto M. Kumasaka T. Nakanishi S. Jingami H. Morikawa K. Nature. 2000; 407: 971-977Crossref PubMed Scopus (1118) Google Scholar). Our model (Fig. 4A) presented Verify3D scores similar to those determined with the mGlu1R VFTM structure (Fig. 4B), indicating that the extracellular domain of DmXR very likely folds like that of mGlu1R. In this model, Ser-153 and Thr-176 (and Asp-196, Tyr-224, and Asp-308, not shown) are in such a position that they can bind the α-amino acid function (Fig. 4D compared with mGlu1R in Fig. 4C). However, changes in the residues that lined the other side of the binding pocket (Arg to Ala and Lys to Gln) in DmXR prevented the binding of the γ-carboxylic group of glutamate (Fig. 4D compared with mGlu1R in Fig. 4C). Moreover, there was no other obvious residue in the LBP that could replace the role of Arg and Lys in the binding of the γ-carboxylic group of glutamate. This further suggested that glutamate could not bind in this binding site and that DmXR might be activated by another amino acid. We also noticed the presence of a phenylalanine (Phe-174) side chain inside the binding pocket of DmXR (Fig. 4D) replacing a Ser or an Ala for the mGluRs. This Phe was also found in the AmXR and in HBmXR LBPs. DmXR Is Not a Glutamate Receptor—In order to test the hypothesis that DmXR might not be activated by glutamate, we expressed an N-terminal tagged version of this receptor (see “Experimental Procedures”) in HEK cells cotransfected with different G-protein α-subunits. The DmXR transduction pathway was analyzed by testing its coupling to wild-type Gαq and to chimeric G-protein αi/o-subunits (Gαqi9 and Gαqo5). These chimeric G-proteins allow many Gi/o-coupled receptors negatively coupled to adenylate cyclase to activate phospholipase C (13Conklin B.R. Farfel Z. Lustig K.D. Julius D. Bourne H.R. Nature. 1993; 363: 274-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (615) Google Scholar). We did not get any stimulation of DmXR with 1–10 mm glutamate (Fig. 5A), although this receptor was properly addressed at the plasma membrane (see Fig. 7A). In contrast, glutamate elicited a 3-fold stimulation of the IP production in cells expressing DmGluAR and Gαqi9 (Fig. 5A). We then verified whether DmXR could couple to G-proteins. In mGluRs, the heptahelical and intracellular domain are involved in the coupling to G-proteins (28Francesconi A. Duvoisin R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5615-5624Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). A chimeric receptor composed of the extracellular domain of DmGluAR, which contains the glutamate VFTM, and the heptahelical and intracellular domain of DmXR was constructed (see “Experimental Procedures”). After application of 1 mm glutamate, this chimeric receptor induced a 150% IP stimulation above control when cotransfected with Gαqi9 (chimera in Fig. 5A) and Gαqo5 (not shown) but not with Gαq (not shown). These results indicated that the DmXR was coupled in HEK cells to Gαi and Gαo like group II and III mGluRs (7Parmentier M.L. Joly C. Restituito S. Bockaert J. Grau Y. Pin J.P. Mol. Pharmacol. 1998; 53: 778-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). This also indicated that the lack of glutamate stimulation obtained with DmXR was not due to the inability of this receptor to activate these mammalian G-proteins. We then examined whether other ionotropic and metabotropic glutamate receptors agonists (α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid, kainate, N-methyl-d-aspartate, quisqualate, and l-2-amino-4-phosphonobutyric acid) could activate DmXR cotransfected with Gαqi9, but none of these compounds displayed any significant activity (not shown). Finally, because the α-amino acid-binding motif was conserved in mXRs, the agonist activity of all other standard and some unusual amino acids (see legend of Fig. 5A) were also examined. None of these molecules induced any detectable activation of the receptor. We thus decided to probe the activity of the DmXR with tissue extracts that should contain the natural ligand of this receptor.Fig. 7Targeting and site-directed mutagenesis of DmXR.A, expression and surface targeting of the T176A DmX mutant (panel 1) and the wild-type (panel 2) receptor.

We performed RT-PCR experiments on brain or abdomen RNA extracts of adult flies and could amplify DmXR messenger RNA in female and male brain but not in the abdomen (Fig. 5B). These results suggested that the ligand of DmXR should also be found in the brain. A Drosophila Endogenous Compound with a Primary Amino Group Activates DmXR—Drosophila head extracts enriched in small hydrophilic molecules were prepared after removal of proteins with 10% trichloroacetic acid and assayed on HEK cells coexpressing DmXR and Gαqi9. As shown in Fig. 6A, 2 mg (1×) of fresh head extracts activated DmXR. Increasing the concentration of head extract leads to increased DmXR-triggered response (Fig. 6A). The same head extract also stimulated DmGluAR (Fig. 6A). This last result indicated that glutamate (and likely other amino acids) was indeed present in the extract. To determine whether the active molecule present in the Drosophila head extract possessed a primary amino group, we treated the extract with formaldehyde which should mask this amino group (29Aurelio L. Brownlee R.T. Hughes A.B. Org. Lett. 2002; 4: 3767-3769Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) (Fig. 6B). As shown in Fig. 6C, the treated Drosophila head extract was unable to activate DmXR and DmGluAR. As expected, 1 mm glutamate treated with formaldehyde was also unable to activate DmGluAR. We verified that the effect of formaldehyde at the used concentration was not due to a toxic action on the HEK cells because the IP production of the control HEK cells in the presence of formaldehyde was not modified (Fig. 6C). However, our amino acid extraction protocol did not allow the removal of small peptides. We therefore wanted to determine whether the active molecule in the extract had a peptide bond. To answer this question, we hydrolyzed the extract with hydrochloric acid 6 n at 120 °C for 24 h, a procedure that should disrupt all peptide bonds. As control for this reaction, the nonapeptide arginine vasopressin (AVP), an agonist of the human vasopressin V1a receptor (14Mouillac B. Chini B. Balestre M.N. Jard S. Barberis C. Manning M. Tribollet E. Trumpp-Kallmeyer S. Hoflack J. Elands J. Hibert M. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1995; 395: 301-310PubMed Google Scholar), was hydrolyzed in the same way. As shown in Fig. 6D, the hydrolyzed Drosophila head extract still activated both the DmXR and the DmGluAR. In contrast, the hydrolyzed AVP was unable to activate the V1ah receptor, as opposed to the untreated AVP (Fig. 6D). This showed that the active molecule in the extract did not require any peptide bond to activate the receptor. Taken together, these results were in accordance with our hypothesis that the DmXR endogenous agonist might be an α-amino acid-like molecule. The Endogenous Ligand Acts into the LBP—Because the majority of the residues involved in the binding of glutamate in the mGluRs were conserved in DmXR and were in a correct position to interact with the ligand according to our three-dimensional model, we asked whether this conserved part of the LBP was also involved in the binding of the DmXR ligand. To this aim we constructed a mutant receptor containing an alanine substitution of Thr-176, the DmXR homologue of the crucial residue Thr-188 (in mGlu1R). The mutation of this residue is known to completely inactivate the glutamate-induced response of mGlu1R (30Sato T. Shimada Y. Nagasawa N. Nakanishi S. Jingami H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 4314-4321Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) and other mGluRs (31Malherbe P. Knoflach F. Broger C. Ohresser S. Kratzeisen C. Adam G. Stadler H. Kemp J.A. Mutel V. Mol. Pharmacol. 2001; 60: 944-954Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 32Hampson D.R. Huang X.P. Pekhletski R. Peltekova V. Hornby G. Thomsen C. Thogersen H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33488-33495Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The DmXR mutant was well expressed in HEK cells and was addressed at the plasma membrane of these cells (Fig. 7A). As shown in Fig. 7B, the mutated receptor was no longer stimulated by the extract, indicating that the Thr residue was also essential for the activation of DmXR by the endogenous compound in the extract. We then tested the role of the new residues Ala (77 in DmXR) and Gln (401 in DmXR) found in the mXRs LBP as well as the role of the phenylalanine side chain that was found inside the ligand pocket according to the three-dimensional model of the DmXR LBP (Phe-174). These three residues were mutated to Arg, Lys, and Ala, respectively. This triple mutant could still be activated by the Drosophila head extracts (Fig. 7B), indicating that these residues played no major role in the binding of the endogenous ligand. This is also consistent with these three residues not being important for the correct folding of the DmXR, in agreement with our three-dimensional model. Although the LBP of the triple DmXR mutant contained all key residues directly contacting glutamate in all other mGluRs, glutamate was still unable to stimulate this receptor (Fig. 7B). This suggests that more general changes than the substitution of two residues had occurred in the structure of the DmXR LBP. DmXR Is Activated by Other Insect Extracts—Because mXR-like sequences were not found in C. elegans nor in the mouse and human genome sequences, we examined the effect of extracts from C. elegans or mouse brain on DmXR. Transfected HEK cells did not respond to the addition of these extracts (Fig. 8), whereas the positive control DmGluAR was already fully activated with 5 times less concentrated extracts (Fig. 8). These results suggested that the DmXR ligand was either not present or present at a very low concentrations in these extracts. However, extracts from two other insects, S. gregaria brain and Anopheles, were also able to induce a clear response (Fig. 8). Our data show that a strong divergence in the LBP and in the endogenous ligand of the mGluRs can occur during evolution, leading to a new group of mGluR-like protein called mXR. The new LBP has evolved so divergently that the receptor lost its ability to be activated by glutamate. Furthermore, our results indicate that the mXRs are activated by a new natural ligand, not identified yet. Indeed a large range of amino acids, GABA, and calcium that would activate other class III receptors were inactive on DmXR. It appears that the structural changes in the new LBP have occurred mostly in the γ-carboxylic binding part of the pocket, whereas the α-amino acid binding part was conserved. This suggests that the mXRs natural ligand might be an amino acid-like molecule. Our DmXR triple mutagenesis shows that the mXR new residues found instead of the glutamate binding consensus are not critical for the activation on the one hand, whereas on the other hand the triple mutant with the rebuilt glutamate binding consensus is still not activated by glutamate. These results suggest that the chemical environment of the γ-carboxylic binding part of the pocket has been strongly modified during divergent evolution. The availability of the whole genome sequences enables exhaustive comparisons of a protein family between different model organisms. There are three mGlu-like receptors in the C. elegans genome, and the comparisons of the LBP sequences of these evolutionary distant receptors show that each C. elegans receptor can be assigned to an mGluR group (5Pin J.-P. Acher F. Curr. Drug Targets CNS Neurol. Disord. 2002; 1: 297-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). This clearly indicates that a receptor for each group existed in the common ancestor of the nematodes and the vertebrates. We found only two mGluR homologues in insects like Anopheles 2C. Mitri, M.-L. Parmentier, J.-P. Pin, J. Bockaert, and Y. Grau, unpublished observations. and Drosophila, mGluAR and mXR. Two evolutionary scenarios can be hypothesized to explain this situation. In the first scenario, the mXR has diverged from a group III receptor that is also coupled to Gαi/o proteins. The group I receptor, which is coupled to Gαq protein, would have disappeared either before or after this divergence. In the second scenario, the group II receptor gene would have been duplicated so that one of the two genes could have evolved divergently, and the group I and group III receptors would have disappeared either before or after these duplication and divergence events. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that the mXR belonged to the branch leading to the group II and III receptors. However, we could not assign the mXR to either group II or III receptors with a sufficiently good bootstrap score. Thus, to date we are still unable to choose between one of the two scenarios presented. This new metabotropic non-glutamate receptor was not found in C. elegans nor in mammalian genomic sequences. Furthermore, only extracts from insects have been able to stimulate DmXR. Taken together, these observations suggest that the mXR would be specific to insects and the cognate mX ligand would also be specific to insects. We show that DmXR is expressed in the adult brain of Drosophila. Whether the function of mXR in the insect central nervous system is completely new or whether it takes the place of glutamatergic neurotransmission remains to be determined.

https://openalex.org/W1974956364,"Post-translational modification of Ras proteins includes prenylcysteine-directed carboxyl methylation. Because Ras participates in Erk activation by epidermal growth factor (EGF), we tested whether Ras methylation regulates Erk activation. EGF stimulation of Erk was inhibited by AFC (N-acetyl-S-farnesyl-l-cysteine), an inhibitor of methylation, but not AGC (N-acetyl-S-geranyl-l-cysteine), an inactive analog of AFC. AFC inhibited Ras methylation as well as the activation of pathway enzymes between Ras and Erk but did not inhibit EGF receptor phosphorylation, confirming action at the level of Ras. Transient transfection of human prenylcysteine-directed carboxyl methyltransferase increased EGF-stimulated Erk activation. AFC but not AGC inhibited movement of transiently transfected green fluorescent protein-Ras from the cytosol to the plasma membrane of COS-1 cells and depleted green fluorescent protein-Ras from the plasma membrane in stably transfected Madin-Darby canine kidney cells, suggesting that methylation regulates Erk by ensuring proper membrane localization of Ras. However, when COS-1 cells were transfected with Ras complexed to CD8, plasma membrane localization of Ras was unaffected by AFC, yet EGF-stimulated Erk activation was inhibited by AFC. Thus, Ras methylation appears to regulate Erk activation both through the localization of Ras as well as the propagation of Ras-dependent signals.

Thus, Ras methylation appears to regulate Erk activation both through the localization of Ras as well as the propagation of Ras-dependent signals. Ras proteins are GTPases that regulate a wide variety of cellular functions, including growth and differentiation. Ras proteins must associate with cellular membranes to be biologically active (1Willumsen B.M. Christensen A. Hubbert N.L. Papageorge A.G. Lowy D.R.

Synthesized on free polysomes as a hydrophilic protein, Ras associates secondarily with membranes as a consequence of a series of post-translational modifications of its carboxyl terminus (4Clarke S.

Ras is a member of a large class of proteins that terminate in a CAAX motif (C, cysteine; A, usually aliphatic; X, any amino acid) that serves as a signal for modification. First the CAAX cysteine is farnesylated by addition of a 15-carbon polyisoprene lipid via a stable thioether linkage. The nascent farnesylated protein has affinity for the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) 1The abbreviations used are: ER, endoplasmic reticulum; pcCMT, prenylcysteine-directed carboxyl methyltransferase; PM, plasma membrane; CS, cytosol; AFC, N-acetyl-S-farnesyl-l-cysteine; AGC, N-acetyl- S-geranyl-l-cysteine; EGF, epidermal growth factor; EGFR, EGF receptor; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; MBP, myelin basic protein; MDCK, Madin-Darby canine kidney; GFP, green fluorescent protein; FTS, farnesyl thiosalicylate.

The newly exposed carboxyl-terminal farnesyl cysteine then becomes a substrate for prenylcysteine carboxyl methyltransferase (pcCMT) that methylesterifies the carboxyl group. Like Rce1, pcCMT is restricted to the ER (12Dai Q. Choy E. Chiu V. Romano J. Slivka S.R. Steitz S.A. Michaelis S. Philips M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15030-15034Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). The net effect of these modifications is to remodel the hydrophilic carboxyl terminus of Ras into a hydrophobic domain that presumably interacts with the phospholipid bilayer. Ras isoform-specific differences have emerged for trafficking events following CAAX processing. For N-Ras and H-Ras, transport from the endomembrane to the plasma membrane (PM) proceeds via vesicular transport (9Choy E. Chiu V.K. Silletti J. Feoktistov M. Morimoto T. Michaelson D. Ivanov I.E. Philips M.R. Cell. 1999; 98: 69-80Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (620) Google Scholar) and is absolutely dependent on palmitoylation of cysteines immediately upstream of the processed CAAX motif (9Choy E.

Biol. 2000; 20: 2475-2487Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). K-Ras lacks palmitoylation sites and traffics to the PM by an as yet uncharacterized pathway that depends on a polylysine region adjacent to the CAAX sequence (14Apolloni A. Prior I.A. Lindsay M. Parton R.G. Hancock J.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 2475-2487Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). The development of farnesyltransferase inhibitors has validated the Ras membrane trafficking pathway as a target for anti-cancer drug development (15Gibbs J.B. Oliff A. Ann. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1997; 37: 143-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). Accordingly, much attention has been focused on the modifications that follow farnesylation. Although farnesylation of Ras clearly affords affinity for membranes (16Silvius J.R. l'Heureux F. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 3014-3022Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar), the precise role of carboxyl methylation remains uncertain. Although methylesterification contributes to hydrophobicity by neutralizing the negative charge of the carboxyl terminal carboxyl group, the net additional hydrophobicity is small relative to that imparted by farnesylation, suggesting that this modification may play a role beyond nonspecific membrane affinity. Indeed, as the only modification of the CAAX sequence reversible at physiologic pH, carboxyl methylation has been postulated to modulate signaling events by regulating protein-protein interactions in much the same way as protein phosphorylation (17Philips M.R. Pillinger M.H. Staud R. Volker C. Rosenfeld M.G. Weissmann G. Stock J.B. Science. 1993; 259: 977-980Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Although mutation of the CAAX cysteine blocks all processing steps and renders Ras molecules inactive, carboxyl methylation cannot be specifically blocked by modification of the substrate because the only absolute requirement for pcCMT is the farnesylcysteine itself (18Tan E.W.

Spontaneously immortalized murine embryonic fibroblasts from pcCMT-/- embryos have been generated. Ras proteins are mislocalized to the cytosol (CS) of these cells (23Bergo M.O. Leung G.K.

Although these cells grow more slowly than those derived from wild-type littermates (22Bergo M.O. Leung G.K. Ambroziak P. Otto J.C. Casey P.J. Gomes A.Q. Seabra M.C. Young S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 5841-5845Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar), studies of the Ras signaling pathway have proven inconclusive because of the high background activity attributed to the spontaneous immortalization. An alternative approach to elucidating the role of carboxyl methylation in Ras signaling is to use pharmacologic inhibitors. In this study we have utilized N-acetyl-S-farnesyl-l-cysteine (AFC), a well established inhibitor of pcCMT (21Pillinger M.H. Volker C. Stock J.B. Weissmann G. Philips M.R. J. Biol.

We have chosen to analyze the Ras/mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway downstream of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) because it is the most completely understood of the pathways regulated by Ras. Our results reveal that methylation mediates Ras signaling by two mechanisms. The first is to regulate membrane trafficking. The second is to mediate a trafficking-independent process likely to involve protein-protein interactions. Materials—Unless otherwise stated, all materials were from Sigma. Myelin basic protein (MBP), penicillin/streptomycin (10,000 units/ml penicillin G and 10,000 μg/ml streptomycin), and fetal bovine serum were from Invitrogen. Antisera and monoclonal antibodies were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology unless otherwise specified. [γ-32P]ATP was from Amersham Biosciences for most assays and from PerkinElmer Life Sciences for the Raf-1 kinase assay. Tris-glycine polyacrylamide gels were from Novex. Phosphocellulose circles (P81 filter paper) were from Whatman. Easy Tag™ [35S]methionine/cysteine was from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. [3H]methyl methionine was from Amersham Biosciences. Raf-1 immunoprecipitation kinase cascade assay kit (catalogue number 17-173) was from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and 2.5% trypsin were from BioWhittaker. SuperFect™ transfection kit was from Qiagen. AFC and N-acetyl-S-geranyl-l-cysteine (AGC) were from Biomol and were resuspended in dimethyl sulfoxide before use. Because AFC demonstrated as much as 40% variability in potency and toxicity between lots, all new lots of AFC were tested for toxicity and the maximum non-toxic concentration was normalized to a concentration of 150 μm. Cell Culture and Transfection—COS-1 cells and MDKC cells, obtained from the American Type Culture Collection, were cultured in 6-well plates according to the instructions of the supplier. For most experiments (see below), cells were grown to near confluency, followed by serum starvation for 24-48 h prior to stimulation and/or other treatment. Cell toxicity of AFC was determined as lactate dehydrogenase release, measured by colorimetric LD-L 10 assay, according to the instructions of the manufacturer. For assays of cell proliferation, COS-1 cells were plated at dilutions sufficient to accomplish ∼30% confluency. Cells were cultured overnight in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/10% fetal bovine serum/penicillin/streptomycin, followed by replacement of the medium with identical medium containing AFC or AGC, and grown for 40 h. The cells were removed from the plate by trypsinization, diluted in Hank's balanced saline solution, and counted manually using a hemocytometer. Results of counting were expressed as cells/well × 104. For transfection experiments, COS-1 cells were seeded at a density of 1.32 × 105 cells/well into 6-well plates and cultured overnight in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/10% fetal bovine serum/penicillin/streptomycin. Cells were washed once with Hank's balanced saline solution followed by transfection of plasmids using the SuperFect™ system according to the manufacturer's instructions. As an approximate measure of transfection efficiency in pcCMT transfection experiments, COS-1 cells were transfected with vector/green fluorescent protein (GFP)-pcCMT and transfection efficiency scored by the presence of green fluorescence. In these experiments, transfection efficiency ranged from 16-21%. Stable MDCK cell lines containing GFP-H Ras, GFP-N Ras, and GFP-K Ras were as described previously (9Choy E. Chiu V.K. Silletti J.

Erk and Mek Phosphorylation and Erk Kinase Activity—The phosphoactivation states of Erk and Mek were determined by subjecting experimental lysates to SDS-PAGE analysis, electrophoretic transfer to nitrocellulose and immunoblotting for the phosphorylated, active forms of Erk and Mek, respectively, as previously described (25Pillinger M.H.

Duplicate samples were similarly treated and immunoblotted for total levels of Erk and Mek, and Erk and Mek phosphorylation measurements were normalized to the total levels of these proteins. To directly determine the kinase activity of Erk, COS-1 cells were prepared, treated, and lysed as described under “Results.” Lysates were centrifuged (3000 × g × 10 min), the supernatants were immunoprecipitated for Erk 1 and 2, and the immunoprecipitants were assayed for their ability to phosphorylate MBP as previously described (26Capodici C. Pillinger M.H. Han G. Philips M.R. Weissmann G. J. Clin. Investig. 1998; 102: 165-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Duplicate assays in the absence of MBP were performed to determine background, non-MBP-directed kinase activities and subtracted from the measured MBP kinase activity. Raf-1 Activity Assay—COS-1 cells were grown to near confluence in 75-cm3 flasks, serum-starved for 24-48 h, incubated with AFC (150 μm) or AGC (150 μm) for 16 h, and stimulated in the absence or presence of EGF (20 ng/ml) for 10 min, all at 37 °C. Cells were lysed and centrifuged, and equivalent amounts (∼2 mg/experiment) of supernatant protein from each condition were assayed for Raf-1 kinase activity according to the directions of the assay kit manufacturer. Ras Methylation Assay—COS-1 cells grown in 6-well plates were serum-starved for 4 h and then transferred to serum-free, methionine/cysteine-free medium for 30 min at 37 °C. The cells were incubated for an additional 30 min at 37 °C in 25 μCi of Easy Tag™ [35S]methionine/cysteine (to label protein backbones) and 200 μCi of [3H]methyl methionine (to label S-adenosyl methionine) (17Philips M.R. Pillinger M.H. Staud R. Volker C. Rosenfeld M.G. Weissmann G. Stock J.B. Science. 1993; 259: 977-980Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar) in the absence or presence of 150 μm of AFC or AGC (19Volker C. Lane P. Kwee C. Johnson M. Stock J.B.

The cells were lysed with radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (20 min at 4 °C) and the lysates immunoprecipitated overnight using pan-Ras antibody Y13-259, followed by 1 h of incubation at room temperature with protein A-Sepharose. The pellets were recovered (centrifugation at 1000 × g for 5 min) and analyzed by SDS-PAGE on 14% Tris-glycine gels followed by drying, autoradiography, and phosphorimaging. Visualized 35S bands representing Ras on autoradiography were employed to localize Ras proteins on the original gels from which they were excised. Carboxyl terminal methylation of Ras in the excised gel fragments was then quantitated as previously described (20Volker C. Miller R.A. Stock J.B. Methods Companion Methods Enzymol. 1990; 1: 283-287Crossref Scopus (24) Google Scholar) and normalized to total Ras based on quantitation of 35S Ras. EGFR Phosphorylation—COS-1 cells grown to near confluence in 75-cm3 flasks were serum-starved for 24 h, incubated with AFC (150 μm) or AGC (150 μm) for 16 h, and stimulated for 10 min with EGF (20 ng/ml). Cells were lysed and centrifuged, and 1 mg of each supernatant was immunoprecipitated overnight with agarose bead-conjugated anti-EGFR antibodies (50 μl of a 50% bead slurry) or protein A-conjugated agarose beads as controls. The samples were washed three times in phosphate-buffered saline, incubated with 25 μl of sample buffer for 4 min at 100 °C, and analyzed by 8-16% gradient Tris-glycine SDS-PAGE, transfer to nitrocellulose, immunoblotting using antiphosphotyrosine antibodies and 125I-protein A, and visualization and quantitation by phosphorimaging. Duplicate supernatants were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting for total EGFR, and the amount of phosphotyrosinolated EGFR was normalized to total quantities. Plasmids—GFP-H Ras, GFP-N Ras, and GFP-K Ras were generated as described previously (9Choy E. Chiu V.K. Silletti J. Feoktistov M. Morimoto T. Michaelson D. Ivanov I.E. Philips M.R. Cell. 1999; 98: 69-80Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (620) Google Scholar). Myc-tagged and GFP-tagged pcCMT were also described previously (12Dai Q. Choy E. Chiu V. Romano J.

For CD8-Ras constructs, the coding region of CD8 was amplified by polymerase chain reaction from cDNA using 5′-AGGCGGATCCGCCACCATGGCCTTACCAGTGACC forward and 5′-AGGCGAATTCCGACGTATCTCGCCGAAAG reverse primers and inserted in-frame into BamHI and EcoRI sites in the multiple cloning region of both pCDNA3.1/Hras and pCDNA3.1/Hras C184S described previously (9Choy E.

All constructs were verified by sequencing. Inhibition of pcCMT Inhibits Erk Activation in COS-1 Cells—To determine the effects of inhibition of methylation on Erk activation, COS-1 cells were incubated for 18 h in the absence or presence of varying concentrations of AFC or the control compound AGC, followed by stimulation for 30 min with EGF (20 ng/ml), lysis, and determination of the phosphorylation state of Erk. EGF stimulation resulted in increased Erk phosphorylation (Fig. 1, A (top panel) and B). Although both p44Erk1 and p42Erk2 were observed to undergo phosphorylation, p42Erk2 was the predominant isoform present in these cells. Preincubation with AFC resulted in dose-dependent inhibition of EGF-stimulated Erk activity. Maximum Erk inhibition was observed at concentrations of 150 μm concordant with our previous reports that AFC inhibits methylation of Ras-related proteins with maximal efficacy at that concentration (21Pillinger M.H. Volker C. Stock J.B. Weissmann G. Philips M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1486-1492Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Volker C. Miller R.A. McCleary W.R. Rao A. Poenie M. Backer J.M. Stock J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 21515-21522Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). AFC had little or no effect on the total amount of Erk present (Fig. 1A, bottom panel). AGC, a prenylcysteine analog that does not inhibit pcCMT activity (21Pillinger M.H. Volker C. Stock J.B. Weissmann G. Philips M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1486-1492Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Volker C. Miller R.A. McCleary W.R. Rao A. Poenie M. Backer J.M. Stock J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 21515-21522Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), had no effect on Erk phosphorylation in response to EGF. Concentrations of AFC ≤ 150 μm had no effect on COS-1 cell viability as measured by lactate dehydrogenase release, although concentrations of >150 mm resulted in increasing amounts of lactate dehydrogenase release (Fig. 1C). Accordingly, subsequent experiments were performed with AFC concentrations ≤ 150 μm. Although incubation of COS-1 cells for 12-24 h with 150 μm AFC inhibited EGF stimulation of Erk, incubation for brief periods (≤2 h) had no effect (Fig. 1D). To confirm that the ability of AFC to inhibit Erk phosphorylation reflected inhibition of Erk kinase activity per se, we measured the ability of Erk to phosphorylate MBP in vitro. As shown in Fig. 1E, stimulation of COS-1 cells with EGF resulted in up-regulation of Erk kinase activity that was inhibited by preincubation of cells with AFC (150 μm); thus, phosphoErk reporting was consistent with direct Erk activity assays. Consistent with its effects on a pathway implicated in the regulation of cell growth, preincubation of sparsely plated COS-1 cells with AFC resulted in retardation of cell proliferation (Fig. 1F). AFC Inhibition of Erk Signaling Occurs at the Level of Ras—To confirm that the effects of AFC on Erk activation were a consequence of its effects on Ras, we tested the ability of AFC to inhibit Erk signaling pathway elements proximal and distal to Ras. To confirm that AFC did not have a direct inhibitory effect on Erk activity, lysates of EGF-stimulated COS-1 cells were immunoprecipitated for total (phosphorylated and unphosphorylated) Erk 1 and 2 and the immunoprecipitates analyzed for their ability to phosphorylate MBP in the presence or absence of AFC. As shown in Fig. 1E, concentrations of AFC as high as 150 mm had no direct effect on Erk activity. As shown in Fig. 2A, EGF stimulated Mek activation and AFC inhibited the activation of Mek by EGF. Concentrations of AFC required for Mek inhibition were similar to those required for inhibition of Erk, and AGC had no effect on Mek. AFC had little or no effect on total Mek levels in COS-1 cells. As in the case of Erk, the exposure time required for AFC to inhibit Mek activation was on the order of 12-18 h (Fig. 2B). As shown in Fig. 2C, 16 h of exposure of COS-1 cells to 150 μm AFC also inhibited Raf-1 activation. In contrast, AGC had no effect on Raf-1 activation. These data establish that AFC inhibition of EGF-stimulated Erk activation occurs at or above the level of Ras. To confirm that AFC inhibited Ras methylation, COS-1 cells were dual-labeled with [3H]methyl methionine (17Philips M.R. Pillinger M.H. Staud R. Volker C. Rosenfeld M.G. Weissmann G. Stock J.B. Science. 1993; 259: 977-980Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar) and [35S]methionine/cysteine in the presence or absence of 150 μm AFC or AGC. Ras methylation was measured as alkaline-labile [3H]methyl ester formation, normalized to total Ras synthesis measured as 35S incorporation as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Preincubation of COS-1 cells with AFC but not AGC markedly inhibited the methylation of Ras (Fig. 2D). In contrast to inhibition of Erk, inhibition of methylation of nascent Ras by AFC was observable as early as 30 min after AFC exposure. The delay between the inhibition of methylation (30 min) and inhibition of Erk activation (12-24 h) suggested that AFC affects maturation and/or trafficking of Ras rather than its function as a GTPase. The ability of AFC to inhibit Ras methylation did not formally exclude the possibility that AFC might also inhibit an upstream element of Ras in the Erk signaling pathway. Engagement of EGFR by EGF is the first step in the Erk signaling pathway and results in EGFR tyrosine phosphorylation and activation. As shown in Fig. 2E, stimulation of cells with EGF resulted in marked increases in tyrosine phosphorylation of EGFR. Preincubation with AFC for 18 h prior to EGF stimulation had no effect on the phosphorylation state of EGFR. Thus, AFC does not appear to affect signaling upstream of Ras. Overexpression of pcCMT Enhances EGF-stimulated Erk Activation—The ability of AFC to inhibit Erk activation suggested that Ras methylation is requisite for Erk activation to proceed. We therefore tested whether increases in pcCMT activity result in increases in Erk activation. We have previously determined that transfection of the pcCMT into COS-1 cells results in increased membrane-associated methyltransferase activity directed toward Ras-related proteins (12Dai Q. Choy E. Chiu V. Romano J. Slivka S.R. Steitz S.A. Michaelis S. Philips M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15030-15034Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 3, transfection of cells with pcCMT resulted in no statistically significant increases in resting Erk activity compared with vector-transfected controls. However, pcCMT-transfected cells stimulated with EGF demonstrated increased Erk activity as compared with EGF-stimulated vector controls. Thus, pcCMT activity appears to be necessary but not sufficient for Ras-mediated Erk activation. Inhibition of Methylation Blocks Progression of Nascent Ras to PM and Depletes Ras from the PM—The requirement for long AFC exposures to inhibit Erk activation, in contrast to the short exposures needed to inhibit methylation of nascent Ras, suggested that Ras methylation is unlikely to participate in rapid signaling but might rather represent a necessary prior alteration of Ras in order for signaling to proceed. We have previously reported that pre-exposure of COS-1 cells to AFC for 24 h resulted in diminished accumulation of GFP-NRas and GFP-KRas4B constructs at the PM and increased accumulation of the same constructs in the CS (9Choy E. Chiu V.K. Silletti J. Feoktistov M. Morimoto T. Michaelson D. Ivanov I.E. Philips M.R. Cell. 1999; 98: 69-80Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (620) Google Scholar). To confirm the ability of AFC to block the movement of Ras proteins to the PM, we transiently transfected COS-1 cells with GFP-Ras (GFP H-Ras, N-Ras, and K-Ras) followed by the addition of 150 μm AFC or AGC, incubation for 18 h, and fluorescence microscopic examination. As shown in Fig. 4A, transfection of COS-1 cells with each GFP-Ras isoform in the presence of AGC resulted in the appearance of GFP-Ras at the PM. In contrast, incubation of cells expressing each isoform in the presence of AFC resulted in increased accumulation of Ras in the CS and diminished accumulation at the PM. Thus, AFC has the capacity to block the movement of nascent Ras to the PM. To confirm that blockade of Ras localization results in depletion of Ras already at the membrane, we tested the effects of AFC or AGC on MDCK cells stably transfected with GFP-tagged H-Ras, N-Ras, or K-Ras. As shown in Fig. 4B, MDCK cells stably transfected with each isoform of GFP-Ras and incubated with AGC for 18 h demonstrated fluorescence at the PM. In untreated cells PM fluorescence was also seen and remained stable throughout the observation period, confirming a steady-state distribution of PM GFP-Ras (not shown). In contrast, exposure to AFC for prolonged (18 h) but not brief (2 h) periods resulted in a marked depletion of GFP-Ras at the PM. These data confirm that inhibition of Ras methylation by AFC results in impaired movement of Ras to the PM and demonstrate for the first time that such impairment leads to the depletion of Ras at the PM. Moreover, although AFC inhibition of Ras methylation occurs rapidly after exposure, the time required to deplete PM Ras is much longer and is concordant with the kinetics of AFC inhibition of Erk activation.

Here we cloned the iGDase gene and determined the crystal structures of iGDase of the unliganded form and the complex with acarbose at 2.42-Å resolution. The structure of iGDase is composed of four domains N, A, B, and C.

The structure of iGDase complexed with acarbose revealed that the positions and orientations of the residues at subsites -1 and +1 are nearly identical between iGDase and GA; however, the residues corresponding to subsite 3, which form the entrance of the substrate binding pocket, and the position of the open space and constriction of iGDase are different from those of GAs. On the other hand, domains B and C are not found in the bacterial GAs.

Glucodextranase (EC 3.2.1.70, GDase) 1The abbreviations used are: GDase, glucodextranase; iGDase, A. globiformis I42 glucodextranase; tGDase, A. globiformis T-3044 glucodextranase; GA, glucoamylase; SLH, surface layer homology; GH, glycoside hydrolase. hydrolyzes α-1,6-glucosidic linkages of dextran to release β-d-glucose from the non-reducing end via an inverting reaction mechanism (1Sawai T. Yamaki T. Ohya T. Argic. Biol. Chem. 1976; 40: 1293-1299Google Scholar). Arthrobacter globiformis I42, a Gram-positive bacterium, produces a glucodextranase (iGDase) as an exocellular enzyme (1Sawai T. Yamaki T. Ohya T. Argic. Biol. Chem. 1976; 40: 1293-1299Google Scholar). Although this enzyme hydrolyzes the α-1,4-glucosidic linkages of starch to produce β-d-glucose, its activity for the α-1,4-glucosidic linkages is much less efficient than that for the α-1,6-glucosidic linkages of dextran and isomaltooligosaccharides (2Okada G. Unno T. Agric. Biol. Chem. 1989; 53: 223-228Google Scholar, 3Uotsu-Tomita R. Tonozuka T. Sakai H. Sakano Y. Appl. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 2001; 56: 465-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Oguma et al. (4Oguma T. Kurokawa T. Tobe K. Kitao S. Kobayashi M. J. Appl. Glycosci. 1996; 43: 73-78Google Scholar) isolated a GDase from a different Arthrobacter strain, A. globiformis T-3044 (tGDase), for use in industrial production of cyclodextrans (cycloisomaltooligosaccharides) (4Oguma T. Kurokawa T. Tobe K. Kitao S. Kobayashi M. J. Appl. Glycosci. 1996; 43: 73-78Google Scholar). The gene encoding tGDase has been cloned (it gives rise to a polypeptide consisting of 1023 amino acid residues in the mature form) (5Oguma T. Kurokawa T. Tobe K. Kitao S. Kobayashi M. Biosci. Biotechnol. Biochem. 1999; 63: 2174-2182Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), and the N-terminal portion of the primary structure of tGDase (residues 1-700) has been shown to have 38% identity to a glucoamylase (GA) from Clostridium sp. G0005. We also found that the C-terminal portion of tGDase (residues 700-1023) is weakly homologous with a surface layer homology (SLH) domain conserved in pullulanase from Thermococcus hydrothermalis EM1 (6Erra-Pujada M. Debeire P. Duchiron F. O'Donohue M.J. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 3284-3287Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and amylopullulanase from Pyrococcus abyssi. 2R. Heilig, submitted to the EMBL/GenBank™/DDBJ databases. It is considered that the bacterial SLH domain mediates the binding between exocellular proteins and the cell surface. In the classification of glycoside hydrolase (GH) family members based on the amino acid sequences (8Henrissat B. Biochem. J. 1991; 280: 309-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (2651) Google Scholar, 9Henrissat B. Bairoch A. Biochem. J. 1993; 293: 781-788Crossref PubMed Scopus (1778) Google Scholar, 10Henrissat B. Bairoch A. Biochem. J. 1996; 316: 695-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (1195) Google Scholar), GDase is classified into GH family 15, whose major members are GAs (EC 3.2.1.3). GA hydrolyzes α-1,4-glucosidic linkages of starch, glycogen, and maltooligosaccharides to release β-d-glucose from the non-reducing end. Although GDase and GA cleave different types of glucosidic linkages, both enzymes invert the anomeric form of the substrate and liberate β-d-glucose with exo-type splitting. Other than GDase, an isomaltodextranase from A. globiformis T6 (11Sawai T. Toriyama K. Yano K. J. Biochem. 1974; 75: 105-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) and a dextran 1,6-α-isomaltotriosidase from Brevibacterum fuscum var. dextranlyticum (12Yamaguchi T. Gocho S.G. Agric. Biol. Chem. 1973; 37: 2527-2533Crossref Scopus (12) Google Scholar) have been reported as exo-type dextranases. These exodextranases have, however, entirely different primary structures from iGDase and are categorized into GH families 27 and 49, respectively. Recently, x-ray structures of fungal and bacterial GAs have been reported. The fungal GAs possess a starch-binding domain connected at either the N (13Janecek S. Sevcik J. FEBS Lett. 1999; 456: 119-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) or C termini (14Ashikari T. Nakamura N. Tanaka Y. Kiuchi N. Shibano Y. Tanaka T. Amachi T. Yoshizumi H. Agric. Biol. Chem. 1986; 50: 957-964Crossref Scopus (99) Google Scholar) of the catalytic domain, whereas the bacterial GAs do not have the starch-binding domain but have an extra domain at their N-terminal regions. In a bacterial GA from Thermoanaerobacterium thermosaccharolyticum, the catalytic domain is formed by an (α/α)6-barrel structure, and an extra domain of the N-terminal region is constructed of antiparallel β-sheets (15Aleshin A.E. Feng P.H. Honzatko R.B. Reilly P.J. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 327: 61-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). To clarify the molecular differences between GA and GDase, and to predict the function of the SLH domain of GDase, we cloned the gene for iGDase, which we describe here. We also crystallized iGDase using the native enzyme purified from the culture of A. globiformis I42, and present here the three-dimensional structure of iGDase at 2.42-Å resolution. To our knowledge, this is the first time that the three-dimensional structure of a full-length polypeptide containing the SLH domain has been analyzed. The structure of iGDase complexed with a pseudotetrasaccharide inhibitor, acarbose, has also been determined at 2.42-Å resolution. Molecular Cloning and DNA Sequencing—The methods of molecular cloning and gene manipulations were based on those of Sambrook et al. (16Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual.2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, New York1989Google Scholar). N-terminal and some internal amino acid sequences of iGDase were determined, and oligonucleotides encoding these sequences were prepared. PCR amplifications were carried out using several combinations of these oligonucleotides, but no positive clone was obtained, probably due to the high GC content of A. globiformis I42 genomic DNA (data not shown). While the procedure mentioned above was being carried out, the nucleotide sequence of the tGDase gene was reported. Part of the deduced amino acid sequence of tGDase, ADGSPWDGTS-VSRLW, contains a partial amino acid sequence of iGDase, ADGSPXD, and accordingly an oligonucleotide of the corresponding sequence of tGDase, 5′-CCA AAG CCG TCC AAC GCC GGT GCC GTC CCA CGG CGA ACC GTC NGC-3′, was synthesized and radiolabeled. SphI digests of A. globiformis I42 genomic DNA were ligated into pUC119, and the radiolabeled oligonucleotide described above was hybridized with the resultant genomic DNA library. A plasmid containing a fragment (4.1 kb), which encodes the N-terminal part of iGDase, was obtained and designated pG1D13. Gene walking was further carried out with a genomic DNA library constructed using SacI digests of A. globiformis I42 genomic DNA and pUC119. A fragment (4.5 kb), which encodes the C-terminal part of iGDase, was obtained, and the plasmid containing it was designated pG1D9. The nucleotide sequence of iGDase has been submitted to the DDBJ/EMBL/GenBank™ databases (accession number AB033333). Purification, Crystallization, and Data Collection—Because the level of production of the recombinant iGDase in Escherichia coli was extremely low, iGDase was produced in the original strain A. globiformis I42 and purified as described (17Okada G. Unno T. Sawai T. Agric. Biol. Chem. 1988; 52: 2169-2176Google Scholar). The crystals were grown at 20 °C using the hanging drop, vapor diffusion method, where 1.5 μl of an 8 mg/ml iGDase solution in 20 mm sodium acetate buffer (pH 6.0) containing 5 mm calcium acetate was mixed with an equal volume of a crystallization reservoir solution containing 3.0% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 8000, 80 mm potassium dihydrogen phosphate in 50 mm sodium acetate buffer (pH 5.1). To perform data collection at cryogenic temperatures, the crystals were immersed in a cryo-protectant solution consisting of the well solution with the addition of 30% (w/v) glycerol. The crystal of the complex of iGDase with the inhibitor was obtained by soaking with the same cryo-protectant solution containing 1.0 mm acarbose (Bayer AG, Germany). The diffraction data of unliganded iGDase and iGDase-inhibitor complex were collected at the beam line of BL38B1 of Spring8 and NW-12 of PF-AR, respectively. All data were processed and scaled using HKL2000 (18Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38617) Google Scholar).

Teplyakov A. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1997; 30: 1022-1025Crossref Scopus (4175) Google Scholar) and program CNS (20Brünger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16979) Google Scholar), and the structure of T. thermosaccharolyticum GA (PDB entry 1LF6) (13Janecek S. Sevcik J. FEBS Lett. 1999; 456: 119-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) was used as a search model. Although the whole structure of T. thermosaccharolyticum GA was initially used as the search model, reasonable phases were not obtained. Therefore, the structure of T. thermosaccharolyticum GA was divided into two models, namely, the parts containing domains N and A (residues 25-279, and 292-684), respectively, and these two models were used independently as the starting models (the detailed description of each domain is given under “Results”). After placement of domain A of the T. thermosaccharolyticum GA structure calculated with CNS, clear 2Fo - Fc electron density was observed. This structure was fixed and placement of domain N of the T. thermosaccharolyticum GA structure was further performed using program MOL-REP of CCP4. Several programs were tested for placing the search models, and the combination of programs described above gave the best results. All refinement cycles of the structure were carried out using the protocols of simulated annealing and minimization of coordinates and individual thermal parameters of the CNS program. After the initial refinement of the structure of domains N and A, the density modification protocol of CNS was applied, and adequate phases to all domains (N, A, B, and C) were clearly obtained. The chain trace toward the 2Fo - Fc electron density corresponding to domains B and C of iGDase, which were not found in T. thermosaccharolyticum GA, was implemented using the program ARP/wARP (21Perrakis A. Morris R. Lamzin V.S. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 458-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (2565) Google Scholar). Manual adjustment and rebuilding of the model were carried out with the program Xfit in the XtalView system (22McRee D. J. Mol. Graph. 1992; 10: 44-47Crossref Google Scholar). Solvent molecules were gradually introduced if the peaks above 4.0 σ in the Fo - Fc electron density map were in the range of a hydrogen bond. To avoid overfitting of the diffraction data, a free R-factor with 10% of the test set excluded from refinement was monitored (23Brünger A.T. Nature. 1992; 355: 472-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (3872) Google Scholar). Refinements of the final structure were converged at an R-factor of 0.193 (Rfree = 0.227). The structure of the iGDase-acarbose complex was solved by molecular replacement using the unliganded iGDase as the starting model. After simulated annealing refinement using CNS, difference Fourier maps clearly revealed density corresponding to three saccharide units. An acarbose molecule was identified with the valienamine ring in a 2H3 half-chair conformation and the other two sugar rings in the 4C1 chair form. Topology and parameter files for acarbose were gained from the HIC-Up data base (24Kleywegt G.J. Jones T.A. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 1119-1131Crossref PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar). The structure of the iGDase-acarbose complex was finally refined with CNS (R-factor 0.196, Rfree 0.238). The figures were prepared using XtalView, PyMOL, Raster3D (25Merritt E.A. Murphy M.E.P. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 869-873Crossref PubMed Scopus (2859) Google Scholar), or MolScript (26Kraulis P.J. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1991; 24: 946-950Crossref Google Scholar). Protein Data Bank Accession Number—The atomic coordinates and structure factors of unliganded iGDase (code 1UG9) and acarbose complex (code 1ULV) have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank. Comparison of the Primary Structures of iGDase and Related Enzymes—The iGDase gene was cloned, and the primary structure was deduced. A homology search of iGDase with other proteins was implemented in the DDBJ data base using the BLAST program. A GDase from A. globiformis T-3044 (tGDase), a different strain from A. globiformis I42, was the most homologous protein (80% similarity) over their entire primary structures. Apart from the homology to the GDase, the N-terminal and C-terminal parts of iGDase are individually homologous with different kinds of proteins. The primary structure of iGDase is divided into two regions based on the similarity of the primary structure; these regions are designated the N region (residues 1-689) and C region (residues 690-1020) (Fig. 1). The N region shows high similarity to bacterial GAs from organisms such as T. thermosaccharolyticum (27Ducki A. Grundmann O. Konermann L. Mayer F. Hoppert M. J. Gen. Appl. Microbiol. 1998; 44: 327-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) (36% identify and 52% similarity) and Clostridium sp. G0005 (28Ohnishi H. Kitamura H. Minowa T. Sakai H. Ohta T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 207: 413-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) (36% identify and 52% similarity). Although the similarity to eukaryotic GAs, for example GAs from Aspergillus awamori var. X-100 3I. Diagne, V. T. Pechexonov, S. A. Bulat, and L. M. Firsov, submitted to the EMBL/GenBank™/DDBJ databases. and Saccharomycopsis fibuligera (30Itoh T. Ohtsuki I. Yamashita I. Fukui S. J. Bacteriol. 1987; 169: 4171-4176Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), was low (less than 10%), both iGDase and eukaryotic GAs share the five conserved regions proposed for GA (31Coutinho P.M. Reilly P.J. Protein Eng. 1994; 7: 393-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the C region shows 29% identity to the S-layer homology (SLH) domain of the T. hydrothermalis pullulanase (6Erra-Pujada M. Debeire P. Duchiron F. O'Donohue M.J. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 3284-3287Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The SLH domain has been reported to serve as a cell wall anchor, and has also been found in several other exocellular proteins (32Lupas A. Engelhardt H. Peters J. Santarius U. Volker S. Baumeister W. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 1224-1233Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Overall Structure of iGDase—The crystal structures of unliganded iGDase and its complex with acarbose have been determined. Both crystals belonged to space group C2 and contained one molecule in an asymmetric unit. In the final 2Fo - Fc electron density map of both structures (1 σ contoured), all amino acid residues were visible except for the N-terminal glutamic acid residue, although the N-terminal amino acid residue was determined to be glutamic acid using a protein sequencer, and 584 solvent water molecules and 6 calcium ions were well fitted. Ramachandran plots (33Ramachandran G.N. Sasisekharan V. Adv. Protein Chem. 1968; 23: 283-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (2770) Google Scholar) calculated with the program PROCHECK (34Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. PROCHECK v. 2: programs to Check the Stereochemical Quality of Protein Structures. Oxford Molecular Ltd, Oxford, UK1992Google Scholar) revealed that only one residue (Ala-838) was found in the disallowed region, yet electron density for this residue was well defined. The whole structure of iGDase is shown in Fig. 2. iGDase is composed of four domains, N, A, B, and C. Domain N (residues 1-274), uniquely found in bacterial and archaeal glucoamylases and glucodextranases, is composed of 17 antiparallel β-strands. These β-strands are divided into two β-sheets, and one of the β-sheets is wrapped by an extended polypeptide that consists of the first 20 residues, which appear to stabilize domain N. Domain A (residues 275-685) is an (α/α)6-barrel structure that is common among the GH15 family enzymes, and two α-helices connect domains N and A by forming a linker region. Domain B (residues 686-773) consists of antiparallel eight-strand β-sheets. Domain C (residues 774-1020) is composed of 17 antiparallel β-strands forming three typical β-sheets, and from the first to the last strand in each sheet, the direction rotates by over 90°. The topology of the secondary structure elements of iGDase is described in Fig. 3. Six calcium atoms are found per iGDase molecule. Two, one, and three calcium ion-binding sites are located at domains N, A, and C, respectively.Fig. 3Topology of secondary structure elements of iGDase. α-Helices are signified by black boxes, and β-strands are surrounded by white boxes.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Although many interactions are observed between domains N and A, domains B and C are relatively isolated, and a significant curvature is located between domains A and B (Fig. 2c). A short linker, consisting of nine amino acid residues (residues 685-693, AGTPLSSPE), connects an α-helix (AH13) in domain A and a β-strand (BS1) in domain B, and contains two proline and one glycine residues. The hydrophobic interactions among Ala-468 at AH7, Ala-755 at BS7, and Val-765 at BS8 are also involved in maintaining the curvature of iGDase. The sequence from Pro-688 to Pro-692 appears to be inflexible and to fix the peptide chain, whereas Gly-686 may provide rotational flexibility as a hinge. From the analysis of the primary structure and the x-ray crystallographic study, the function of iGDase protein seems to be divided into two parts for the N region (domains N and A) and C region (domains B and C). Structural homology searches for domains B and C were carried out separately using the DALI server (35Holm L. Sander C. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 233: 123-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (3566) Google Scholar) to predict the function of these two domains. Numerous homologous proteins were found (193 and 61 proteins and fragments were listed in the DALI results for domains B and C, respectively), but their specific functions have not been identified. Domain B shows remarkable homology with proteins containing the immunoglobulin-like fold, chitinase (PDB 1CTN) (36Perrakis A. Tews I. Dauter Z. Oppenheim A.B. Chet I. Wilson K.S. Vorgias C.E. Structure. 1994; 2: 1169-1180Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar) and fibronectin fragment (PDB 1FNH) (37Sharma A. Askari J.A. Humphries M.J. Jones E.Y. Stuart D.I. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1468-1479Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Domain C shows homology with the carbohydrate-binding unit of some glycosidases, endo-1,4-β-xylanase (PDB 1I82) (38Notenboom V. Boraston A.B. Kilburn D.G. Rose D.R. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 6248-6256Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) and exo-1,4-β-d-glycanase (PDB 1EXG) (39Xu G.Y. Ong E. Gilkes N.R. Kilburn D.G. Muhandiram D.R. Harris-Brandts M. Carver J.P. Kay L.E. Harvey T.S. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 6993-7009Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Although structures homologous to domains B and C were found within a single protein, β-galactosidase from Escherichia coli (PDB 1BGL) (40Jacobson R.H. Zhang X.J. DuBose R.F. Matthews B.W. Nature. 1994; 369: 761-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (555) Google Scholar), the homology score was low. β-Galactosidase (1023 residues) folds into five sequential domains, 1-5, and domains 4 and 5 are homologous to domains B and C of iGDase. Both homologous domains of the two enzymes are located in the C-terminal region, but the configurations of the two domains are markedly different in each enzyme. Thus, distinct proteins homologous to domains B and C were found independently; however, no protein homologous to the sequential unit composed of domains B and C was observed. Acarbose-complexed Structure—Acarbose is a pseudotetrasaccharide inhibitor that possesses the acarviosine unit at the non-reducing end. This inhibitor is an α-1,4-glucan mimic, although it was observed to bind iGDase. To facilitate description of the complex, the four saccharide units are numbered as A-D, and the corresponding substrate binding sites are labeled as subsites -1 to +3 (41Davies G.J. Wilson K.S. Henrissat B. Biochem. J. 1997; 321: 557-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (852) Google Scholar) (Fig. 4a). The subsites are numbered from the non-reducing end of acarbose. After the initial refinement of the protein structure, the difference Fourier map indicated a clear continuous electron density for trisaccharide at the active site (Fig. 4b). The O6 hydroxyl groups were seen on the first and third saccharide units from the bottom of the substrate binding pocket, and not seen on the second unit. This finding suggests that the observed trisaccharide corresponds to units A-C of acarbose and the positions of subsites -1 to +2 at the active site of iGDase were assigned. The electron density for unit D of acarbose was not identified in the difference Fourier map. The active site of iGDase is constructed of a shallow wide trough with a narrow hole at the bottom. The acarbose was taken up into the active site so as to protrude from the substrate binding pocket. The A and B units are located deep in the bottom of the pocket and bound with multiple hydrogen bonds, as mentioned below (Fig. 4c). In contrast, unit C is slightly outside of the pocket and interacts with only one residue (Gln-370). The average B-factor of unit C was 38.4 Å2, higher than that of unit A (26.5 Å2) and unit B (27.0 Å2). The electron density of unit D linked to a region further outside of unit C was disordered. The overall conformation of iGDase complexed with acarbose was essentially identical with that of unliganded enzyme, although slight deviations were observed around the loop (residues 620-652) near the catalytic site. The substrate binding pocket seemed to be roughly divided into two parts (Fig. 4b). One side, which mainly consists of Arg-332, Gln-370, Gln-380, and a catalytic residue, Glu-430, participates in the hydrophilic interaction between the enzyme and acarbose. The other side, containing the other catalytic residue, Glu-628, is composed of four aromatic amino acid residues, Tyr-326, Tyr-573, Trp-655, and Trp-582, which appear to contribute to the formation of a large hydrophobic wall. The schematic binding model of iGDase with acarbose is shown in Fig. 4c. Unit A (valienamine moiety) is tightly bound to the enzyme by multiple hydrogen bonds. The O4 and O6 hydroxyl groups form hydrogen bonds with Asp-333 at distances of 2.7 and 2.9 Å, respectively. The O4 hydroxyl group also makes a hydrogen bond with Arg-332 at a distance of 2.8 Å, and the O3 hydroxyl group interacts with the side chain of Arg-332. Unit B (6-deoxyglucoside moiety) makes a stacking interaction with the aromatic ring of Tyr-573, which is further stabilized by hydrogen bonds between the O2 and O3 hydroxyl groups with Glu-431 and Arg-567 at distances of 2.6 Å and 2.4 Å, respectively. At unit C (glucose moiety), only one residue, the O6 hydroxyl group, makes a weak hydrogen bond with Gln-370 at a distance of 3.1 Å. Comparison of Glucoamylase and iGDase—Unlike GDase, GA scarcely hydrolyzes dextran. However, structural similarity between GDase and GA has been found, and both enzymes belong to GH family 15, and thus the structure/function relationship of these enzymes is intriguing. Several crystal structures of GAs complexed with acarbose have already been reported. The structure of iGDase was superimposed on those of a prokaryotic GA from T. thermosaccharolyticum (13Janecek S. Sevcik J. FEBS Lett. 1999; 456: 119-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) and a eukaryotic GA from A. awamori var. X-100 (42Aleshin A.E. Firsov L.M. Honzatko R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15631-15639Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) in this study (Fig. 5). The overall structures of domain A, where acarbose binds, of these three enzymes closely resemble each other. Also, the amino acid residues involved in subsites -1 and +1 are highly conserved among these three enzymes. Molecular surface models of the substrate binding pocket of the enzymes were compared (Fig. 6). At subsites -1 and +1, the amino acid residues of iGDase adopt similar side-chain conformations to those of T. thermosaccharolyticum and A. awamori GAs. Unit A of acarbose and catalytic water fit into the bottom of the substrate binding pocket, and essentially no additional empty space is found in subsite -1, whereas the substrate binding pocket at subsite +1 has a comparatively wider space for binding the substrates. In contrast to subsites -1 and +1, the amino acid residues at subsite +2 are relatively poorly conserved. The residues in the vicinity of subsite +2 form an entrance for the substrate binding pocket. Two residues located at this entrance, the positions equivalent to Gln-380 and Trp-582 of iGDase, are strikingly different among these three enzymes. Gln-380 of iGDase does not directly interact with acarbose (Figs. 4c and 6a), which gives a wide and shallow substrate binding pocket to iGDase, and this wide and shallow pocket may be favorable for accommodating the α-1,6-glucosidic linkage of dextran. In T. thermosaccharolyticum GA, Trp-390 is the counterpart of Gln-380 of iGDase, which contributes to forming subsite +2 and interacts with unit C of acarbose (Fig. 6b). In A. awamori GA, an extended loop consisting of five amino acid residues (TGSWG) is observed in this region, and the sequence of the extended loop is also found in other eukaryotic GAs (Fig. 7). This loop protrudes from the entrance of the substrate binding pocket, and is bound to units C and D of acarbose (Fig. 6c). It was reported that the mutational studies of Trp-120 of A. awamori GA located in this extended loop influenced the affinity for isomaltose (43Sierks M.R. Ford C. Reilly P.J. Svensson B. Protein Eng. 1989; 2: 621-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The residues at the position comparable to Trp-582 of iGD-ase, located at the opposite side of this entrance to Gln-380, are also not conserved among the above three enzymes. The plane of the side chain of Trp-582 is nearly perpendicular to the ring of unit C of acarbose. The distance between the CH3 atom of Trp-582 of iGDase and the O3 hydroxyl group of unit C is 3.0 Å. This bulky side chain of Trp-582 makes a constriction at the entrance of the substrate binding pocket (Fig. 6a), which might well influence the uptake of the substrate into this pocket. On the other hand, Tyr-590 of T. thermosaccharolyticum GA is identified as the corresponding residue of Trp-582 of iGDase. Because the side chain of the tyrosine residue is smaller (Fig. 6b), no interaction between this residue and acarbose is found, and the constriction of the substrate binding pocket is also small. In A. awamori GA, the corresponding region around Trp-582 of iGDase is completely lacking (Figs. 6c and 7). These observations show that, in iGDase, the region in the vicinity of Gln-380 is wide open, whereas in T. thermosaccharolyticum and A. awamori GAs, the opposite side to this region of the entrance of the substrate binding pocket is wide open. It is likely that the differences of these regions are responsible for the determination of the substrate specificities of these enzymes. The enzymatic properties of some bacterial and fungal GAs and iGDase have been reported. Their specificities for large polysaccharides, starch and dextran, are strict, and essentially, bacterial and fungal GAs do not hydrolyze dextran while iGDase does not hydrolyze starch. However, bacterial GAs and iGDase have the ability to hydrolyze both α-1,4- and α-1,6-glucosidic linkages of small oligosaccharides like maltose and isomaltose, whereas fungal GAs scarcely hydrolyze isomaltose. The activity for isomaltose of T. thermosaccharolyticum GA was measured as 25% of that for maltose (44Ganghofner D. Kellermann J. Staudenbauer W.L. Bronnenmeier K. Biosci. Biotechnol. Biochem. 1998; 62: 302-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). In iGDase, the activity for maltose was estimated to be 10% of that for isomaltose (3Uotsu-Tomita R. Tonozuka T. Sakai H. Sakano Y. Appl. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 2001; 56: 465-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Also, in a bacterial GA derived from Clostridium sp. G0005, whose primary structure shows 95% homology with T. thermosaccharolyticum GA, the Km value for isomaltose was more than 20 times higher than those of fungal GAs (28Ohnishi H. Kitamura H. Minowa T. Sakai H. Ohta T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 207: 413-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Because the structures of subsites -1 and +1 located near the catalytic residues of bacterial and fungal GAs and iGDase are strikingly identical, one of the possible bases of the differences of their substrate specificities is the differences of the positions of the open space and the constrictions around subsite +2 in their substrate binding pocket, which are organized by the corresponding residues in the vicinity of Gln-380 and Trp-582 of iGDase. Functions of Domains B and C—Although the biochemical properties of domains B and C were not tested, we considered as one of the possibilities that these domains serve as cell wall anchors, because the primary structure of domain C is homologous to those of SLH domains derived from T. hydrothermalis EM1 pullulanase (6Erra-Pujada M. Debeire P. Duchiron F. O'Donohue M.J. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 3284-3287Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and from Pyrococcus abyssi amylopullulanase (7Sleytr U.B. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 1997; 20: 5-12Crossref Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Other exocellular carbohydrate polymer-metabolizing enzymes such as Clostridium thermocellum xylanase (GenBank™ accession number M67438), Bacillus sp. strain KSM-635 alkaline cellulose (M27420) (45Ozaki K. Shikata S. Kawai S. Ito S. Okamoto K. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1990; 136: 1327-1334Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), Thermoanaerobacter saccharolyticum endoxylanase (M97882) (46Lee Y.E. Lowe S.E. Zeikus J.G. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1993; 59: 3134-3137Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), Bacillus sp. strain XAL601 α-amylase-pullulanase (D28467) (47Lee S.P. Morikawa M. Takagi M. Imanaka T. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1994; 60: 3764-3773Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and Thermoanaerobacterium thermosulfurigenes EM1 pullulanase (48Matuschek M. Burchhardt G. Sahm K. Bahl H. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 3295-3302Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) also possess SLH domains. The composition of the domains of the enzymes mentioned above is, however, different from that of iGDase. Except for iGDase, these enzymes each have two or three SLH domains. Brechtel and Bahl (49Brechtel E. Bahl H. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 5017-5023Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) constructed a series of C-terminally truncated forms of T. thermosulfurigenes EM1 xylanase by removing the gene region encoding the SLH domains and showed that multiple SLH domains are necessary for the attachment of the xylanase to the cell wall of T. thermosulfurigenes EM1. In contrast, iGDase has a single SLH domain (i.e. domain C) and also a single domain B, instead of multiple copies of SLH domains. It is likely that the function of the combination of single domains B and C in iGDase is equivalent to that of multiple SLH domains. What might be the role of domain B? The cell surface of Gram-positive bacteria is composed of the underlying peptidoglycan layer and the overlying S-layer. The S-layer has reported to be a regular array of proteins or glycoproteins forming two-dimensional lattices with hexagonal or tetragonal symmetry (50Messner P. Sleytr U.B. Adv. Microb. Physiol. 1991; 33: 213-275Crossref Google Scholar), so that the hydrophobicity of these S-layer proteins is generally high (∼40-60 mol%) (7Sleytr U.B. FEMS Microbiol.

These observations led us to conclude that domain B interacts with the S-layer by hydrophobic interactions. Domain B is buried in the S-layer, and the flexible linker located between domains A and B confers motion to the catalytic unit composed of domains N and A, which is capable of efficient hydrolysis of the substrates located close to the cell surface.

Recent work has demonstrated direct interaction of Homer proteins with type 1 and type 2 ryanodine receptor (RyR) isoforms. Moreover, Homer proteins have been shown to modulate RyR-dependent Ca2+ release in isolated channels as well as in whole cell preparations. We now show that long and short forms of Homer H1 (H1c and H1-EVH1) are potent activators of Ca2+ release via RyR in skeletal muscle fibers (e.g. Ca2+ sparks) and potent modulators of ryanodine binding to membranes enriched with RyR, with H1c being significantly more potent than H1-EVH1. Homer did not significantly alter the spatio-temporal properties of the sparks, demonstrating that Homer increases the rate of opening of RyRs, with no change in the overall RyR channel open time and amount of Ca2+ released during a spark. No changes in Ca2+ spark frequency or properties were observed using a full-length H1c with mutation in the EVH1 binding domain (H1c-G89N). One novel finding with each Homer agonist (H1c and H1-EVH1) was that in combination their actions on [3H]ryanodine binding was additive, an effect also observed for these Homer agonists in the Ca2+ spark studies. Finally, in Ca2+ spark studies, excess H1c-G89N prevented the effects of H1c in a dominant negative manner. Taken together our results suggest that the EVH1 domain is critical for the agonist behavior on Ca2+ sparks and ryanodine binding, and that the coiled-coil domain, present in long but not short form Homer, confers an increase in agonist potential apparently through the multimeric association of Homer ligand.

While the functional significance of Homer is yet to be elucidated, an attractive hypothesis is that Homer proteins functionally couple cell surface receptors and intracellular Ca2+ release channels into junctional signaling complexes in neurons (3Xiao B.

Recent results demonstrating that Homer-mediated coupling between mGluRs and InsP3Rs is modulated by neuronal activity (1Beneken J. Tu J.C. Xiao B. Nuriya M. Yuan J.P. Worley P.F. Leahy D.J.

This modulation of Homer-mediated coupling is thought to occur via a competitive inhibition of the binding of Homer long form (Homer 1c; H1c) as a direct consequence of expression of the immediate early gene product Homer 1 “short form” (H1a). The H1a short form is composed of an identical EVH1 binding domain as H1c long form, but lacks the CC and leucine zipper region making self-multimerization unlikely (1Beneken J. Tu J.C. Xiao B.

Cell Calcium. 2003; 34: 261-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) leading to the hypothesis that Homer may play a functional role in Ca2+ signaling in striated muscle. Ca2+ sparks arise from the opening of small groups of RyRs in muscle (12Schneider M.F. Ward C.W. Front. Biosci. 2002; 7: d1212-d1222Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As such, sparks can provide insight into the function of native RyR Ca2+ release channels within an intact triadic structure and while associated with regulatory proteins, possibly distinct from isolated RyR in artifical membranes. In this investigation, we evaluate whether exogenously applied long and short forms of Homer 1, H1c and H1a, can exert a direct effect on RyR Ca2+ release channels within skeletal muscle fibers by monitoring Ca2+ sparks. We demonstrate that long and short forms of Homer H1 (H1c and H1-EVH1) are potent activators of initiation of Ca2+ release via RyR in skeletal muscle fibers (e.g. Ca2+ sparks) and potent modulators of ryanodine binding to membranes enriched with RyR, with H1c being significantly more potent than the same concentration of H1-EVH1 both for Ca2+ sparks and Ry binding. The changes in Ca2+ sparks occurred without any significant alteration in the spatio-temporal properties of the sparks, demonstrating that Homer increases the rate of opening of RyRs, with no change in the overall RyR channel open time and amount of Ca2+ released during a spark. Finally, in Ca2+ spark studies, excess H1c-G89N prevented the effects of H1c in a dominant negative manner. Taken together our results suggest that the EVH1 domain is critical for the agonist behavior on Ca2+ sparks and ryanodine binding and that the CC domain confers an increase in agonist potential apparently through the multimeric association of Homer ligand. Expression, Purification, and Verification of Homer Constructs—GST fusion constructs were made by PCR amplifying Homer-H1c ORF and 1–360-bp fragment with in-frame primers with SalI and NotI sites, and inserting the PCR products into pGEX4T-2 (Amersham Biosciences). Homer1c and H1-G89N mutants were made with the QuickChange Site-directed Mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). Mena EVH1 GST was a gift from Dr. Leahy (Johns Hopkins University). GST fusion plasmids of H1c, H1-EVH1, H1c-G89N, and Mena were transformed into BL21 cells and positive clones expanded. Cells were lysed by sonication, and the lysate was added to 1 ml of glutathione-agarose (Sigma) and sequentially washed twice with 12 ml of phosphate-buffered saline/1% Triton, two times with phosphate-buffered saline, and once with elution buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0). GST fusion Homer proteins then were eluted with 10 mm glutathione (Sigma) in 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0 buffer, and eluted GST-Homer fusion proteins were dialyzed against phosphate-buffered saline at 4 °C overnight. Homer proteins were verified for sequence by tandem mass spectroscopy at the Molecular Structure Facility, University of California, Davis. Imaging Local Ca2+ Release in Permeabilized Muscle Fibers—Experimental procedures and data analysis were performed as previously described by this group (13Shtifman A. Ward C.W. Yamamoto T. Wang J.

In brief, cut segments of single fibers were isolated from ileofibularis muscle of frogs (Rana pipiens). Muscles were harvested from animals following a cold induced torpor (ice slurry), rapid decapitation, and spinal cord destruction, protocols approved by the University of Maryland Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Single fiber segments (3–5 mm) were manually dissected in the relaxing solution containing (mm): 120, potassium glutamate; 2, MgCl2; 0.1, EGTA; 5, sodium Tris maleate; pH 7.00. Cut fiber segments were mounted under stretch in a custom chamber (14Shtifman A. Ward C.W. Wang J. Valdivia H.H. Schneider M.F. Biophys. J. 2000; 79: 814-827Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) and exposed to saponin (12 μg/ml ∼30 s.) in a standard relaxing solution Fibers were then bathed in internal solution (mm; 95, cesium glutamate; 20, creatine phosphate; 4.5, sodium Tris maleate; 13.2, cesium Tris maleate; 5, glucose; 0.1, EGTA; 1, dithiothreitol; 5, total NaATP; 0.65, free Mg2+ containing 0.05 fluo-3 pentapotassium salt). Estimated [Ca2+]free was 0.1 μm. To avoid the osmotic effects of chemical permeabilization 8% dextran (41,000) was added to the solution (15Tsuchiya T. Biophys.

Fibers were imaged for spontaneous Ca2+ release events on an Olympus IX-70 microscope (×60–1.4 NA oil or ×60–1.3 NA water objective) coupled to a Bio-Rad MRC-600 laser scanning confocal system (488 nm excitation) operated in line scan mode (1 s acquisition time; 2 ms/line, 768 pixels/line). Line scan images were computer processed to automatically identify and store spark locations using a relative threshold algorithm as described by Cheng et al. (16Cheng H. Song L.S. Shirokova N.

Faseb J. 2003; 17: 1517-1519Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Identified Ca2+ sparks were analyzed for frequency of occurrence (events·sarcomere-1·sec-1), and for the following spatio-temporal properties: rise time (10–90% ΔF/F; ms), full-duration at half-maximal ΔF/F (FDHM; ms), full-width at half-maximal ΔF/F (FWHM; μm) and amplitude (peak ΔF/F). A sequence of 30–50 line scan images were collected 5 min after application of the control solution (internal solution) and subsequently 5 min after exchange of internal solution containing H1c, H1-EVH1, H1c point mutant G89N, or MENA (singly or in combination as described in the figure legends), or a solution change to another control internal solution (i.e. Sham condition). Spark morphometric parameters were compared using non-parametric analysis (Mann-Whitney Test on Ranks) with significance set at p < 0.05. Frequency responses between conditions were evaluated with analysis of variance with significance set at p < 0.05. Ryanodine Binding to Junctional Sarcoplasmic Reticulum—Junctional sarcoplasmic reticulum (JSR) membranes enriched in RyR1 were prepared from skeletal muscle of New Zealand White rabbits according to the method of Saito (18Saito A. Seiler S. Chu A. Fleischer S. J. Cell Biol. 1984; 99: 875-885Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar). The preparations were stored in 10% sucrose, 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4 at -80 °C until needed. Equilibrium measurement of specific high affinity [3H]ryanodine ([3H]Ry) binding was determined according to the method of Pessah et al. (19Pessah I.N. Anderson K.W. Casida J.E. Biochem. Biophys.

SR vesicles (50 μg of protein/ml) were incubated with or without Homer protein in assay buffer containing HEPES (20 mm) pH 7.1, KCl (250 mm), NaCl (15 mm), varied CaCl2, and [3H]Ry for 3 h at 37 °C. The reactions were quenched by filtration through GF/B glass-fiber filters and washed twice with ice-cold harvest buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, 250 mm KCl, 15 mm NaCl, 50 μm CaCl2, pH 7.1). Nonspecific binding was determined by incubating SR vesicles with 1000-fold excess unlabeled ryanodine. Long Form H1c Increases the Frequency of Occurrence of Spontaneous Ca2+ Sparks—The frequency of occurrence of Ca2+ sparks provides a measure of the rate of opening of the RyR Ca2+ release channel or channels that initiate the Ca2+ spark. Application of long form H1c to permeabilized frog skeletal muscle fibers induced a dramatic rise in the frequency of occurrence of spontaneous Ca2+ sparks, indicating an increased rate of RyR activation. Fig. 1A shows 4 successive 1-s line scan images, first in a control condition and subsequently (∼5 min) following application of 6.25 nm of H1c. In a group of fibers (n = 4) application of 6.25 nm H1c increased Ca2+ spark frequency from 0.023 ± 0.01 to 0.078 ± 0.01 events·sarc-1· sec-1 (p < 0.05). This represents a 3.4-fold increase above the baseline frequency determined within the same fibers (Fig. 2A). An ensemble average of single identified sparks and pseudo-color surface projection for sparks recorded in control and 25 mm H1C is presented in Fig. 1B. Events were superimposed with alignment at the midpoint of the rising phase, and averaged to obtain an image representing the population average. The average sparks were essentially the same in the presence and absence of H1c. Because of the ∼ 14-fold increase in Ca2+ spark frequency in the presence of H1c compared with the control condition, the vast majority of events contributing to increased spark frequency observed are likely the direct result of H1c. Furthermore, H1c-modified fibers exhibit spark events that maintain similar spatio-temporal characteristics to those of control fibers (see Fig. 2C, below).Fig. 2Homer H1c and H1-EVH1 increases the frequency of Ca2+ spark occurrence without altering the spatio-temporal properties of Ca2+ sparks.A, concentration dependence of long form H1c effect on Ca2+ spark frequency at 0, 6.25, 25, and 50 nm Homer H1c.

Mean values (control, H1c, H1-EVH1) for the population were: Amplitude (ΔF/F): 1.06 ± 0.02, 1.03 ± 0.02, 1.05 ± 0.04, RiseTime (ms):5.79 ± 0.11, 6.24 ± 0.10, 5.95 ± 0.24, FWHM (μm):1.86 ± 0.02, 2.03 ± 0.02, 1.97 ± 0.04, FDHM (ms): 12.3 ± 0.2, 12.4 ± 0.13, 12.45 ± 0.37.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The concentration dependence of the H1c effect on Ca2+ spark occurrence is shown in Fig. 2A. Application of 5–50 nm H1c revealed a linear rise in the frequency of Ca2+ spark occurrence with concentration, indicating that 50 nm is well below the dissociation constant of the RyR for H1c and that the maximal effect of H1c on spark frequency is likely to be much greater than shown in Fig. 2A. Further increasing H1c concentration (≥100 nm) resulted in a higher level of Ca2+ spark activity and increase in non-spark fluorescence making the detection and analysis of Ca2+ spark properties unreliable at these high concentrations of H1c (data not shown). A “sham” condition (n = 3) consisting of a solution change to an identical internal solution (0 nm H1c), resulted in a small, non-significant increase in Ca2+ spark frequency thus demonstrating that any mechanical disturbance due to changing experimental conditions had a negligible effect. The spatio-temporal properties of a spark reflect the overall duration and amount of Ca2+ released by the channels that generate that Ca2+ spark (22Schneider M.F. J. Gen. Physiol. 1999; 113: 365-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The effect of H1c on the spatio-temporal parameters for Ca2+ sparks is evaluated between the control and 6.25 nm H1c conditions within the same fibers (n = 4) in Fig. 2C. Despite the robust increase in Ca2+ spark frequency, no significant differences in mean values for spark amplitude (0.99 ± 0.1 versus 1.14 ± 0.1 ΔF/F), rise-time (6.2 ± 0.1 versus 5.8 ± 0.2 ms), spatial width (FWHM; 2.0 ± 0.1 versus 1.9 ± 0.1 μm) or temporal duration (FDHM; 12.4 ± 0.2 versus 12.3 ± 0.2ms) was seen between the control and H1c, respectively. Thus, although H1c does markedly increase the rate of opening of the RyR channels that initiate the sparks (i.e. frequency of Ca2+ sparks), the overall duration and amount of Ca2+ released in a spark does not appear to be significantly altered by the Homer protein. Specificity and Effectiveness of Long versus Short Form Homer 1 on Eliciting Spontaneous Ca2+ Spark Frequency—As reported above, the application of 5–50 nm H1c induced a robust increase in the frequency of occurrence of spontaneous Ca2+ sparks. To evaluate the specificity of H1c effects on spark activity, a point mutation of H1c (H1c-G89N) with impaired ability to bind Homer ligand, but with maintained ability to multimerize, was tested (1Beneken J. Tu J.C. Xiao B. Nuriya M. Yuan J.P. Worley P.F. Leahy D.J. Neuron. 2000; 26: 143-154Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). This mutant exhibits negligible binding to the Homer ligand domain (1Beneken J. Tu J.C. Xiao B. Nuriya M. Yuan J.P. Worley P.F. Leahy D.J. Neuron. 2000; 26: 143-154Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 23Yuan J.P. Kiselyov K. Shin D.M. Chen J. Shcheynikov N. Kang S.H. Dehoff M.H. Schwarz M.K. Seeburg P.H. Muallem S. Worley P.F. Cell. 2003; 114: 777-789Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar). When applied at a 10-fold higher concentration than that of H1c, H1c-G89N failed to significantly alter Ca2+ spark frequency (Fig. 3A). These results suggest that enhanced Ca2+ spark activity is mediated by the interaction between the EVH1 domain of H1c and the Homer ligand domain of RyRs. The specificity of the H1c effect toward RyR shown above was further tested by preincubation of muscle fibers with the InsP3R inhibitor heparin (50 μg/ml). The H1c effect in heparin-treated fibers (n = 2) was similar to that of control fibers (n = 2; data not shown). Application of heparin in the absence of Homer protein also had no effect on spark frequency or properties (n = 2; data not shown) indicating that InsP3R's are not responsible for the Ca2+ sparks seen in frog skeletal muscle, either in the presence or absence of exogenously applied H1c. Short form H1a is an alternatively spliced version of H1c protein composed only of the H1-EVH1 binding domain and lacking the CC domain necessary for self-multimerization. Permeabilized muscle fibers challenged either with 30 nm (n = 7), 50 nm (n = 2), or 150 nm (n = 2) recombinant H1-EVH1 exhibited a significant concentration-dependent increase in spontaneous Ca2+ spark frequency (Fig 2B). However, 30–150 nm H1-EVH1 was less effective in inducing an increase in spontaneous spark activation than 5–50 nm H1c. H1-EVH1 required ∼5-fold higher concentration than H1c to elicit similar increases in Ca2+ spark occurrence, and was unable to induce the highest level of activation seen with H1c in this preparation (Fig. 2B). The spatio-temporal properties of the events measured in the presence of H1-EVH1 were not significantly different from those seen in control and H1c-treated muscle fibers (Fig. 2C). The protein Mena-EVH1 (MENA; murine Ena homologue) was used to test the specificity of H1a effects reported above. Mena-EVH1 lacks a CC domain and is structurally similar to Homer EVH1, yet it binds to a distinct proline-rich sequence independent of the Homer ligand site (1Beneken J. Tu J.C. Xiao B. Nuriya M.

This protein at 50 nm had no effect on the frequency of occurrence of Ca2+ sparks (Fig. 3). The Potential Role of the Homer Multimerization via the CC Domain in Ca2+ Spark Activation—The current results indicate that the activity of Homer 1 toward enhancing the frequency of RyR-mediated spark activity is specific to the EVH1 domain and does not require the CC domain. However the presence of the CC domain of H1c does increase effectiveness of a given concentration of Homer by ∼5-fold (H1c versus H1-EVH1). One possible mechanism responsible for the greater activity of H1c compared with H1a could involve the multimeric nature of H1c via the CC domain. To evaluate this possibility, H1c (6.25 nm) was allowed to equilibrate (∼30 min) in solution together with 10-fold excess of the non-binding point mutant H1c-G89N (above) before challenging the fiber. We predict that pre-equilibration of H1c with excess H1c-G89N should promote the formation of homodimers of H1c-G89N, heterodimers of H1c/H1c-G89N and an insignificant fraction of H1c homodimers based on the stoichiometry at equilibrium (∼83, 16, and 1% respectively). This stoichiometry, we hypothesize, should result in a diminution in the relative efficacy of H1c if multimerization through the CC domain is essential for high efficacy. The results summarized in Fig. 4 show that 6.25 nm H1c, which forms homodimers, promoted the most robust elevation in Ca2+ spark frequency. By comparison, preincubated samples containing 6.25 nm H1c + excess H1c-G89N (in which H1c homodimers constitute ∼1%) applied to fibers greatly blunted the response expected for 6.25 nm H1c alone to a level no different than the control condition, The suppression of the H1c response by excess H1c-G89N cannot be ascribed to simple competitive inhibition at the RyR Homer ligand site since H1c-G89N is a non-binding mutant (1Beneken J.

The subsequent addition of excess H1c (50 nm) to the fibers did promote a drastic increase in Ca2+ spark activation (data not shown), verifying that the spark activating potential remained. To further evaluate this hypothesis, 30 nm H1-EVH1 was preincubated with excess (210 nm) H1c-G89N and subsequently applied to a permeabilized fiber. The activity of this mixture toward enhancing Ca2+ spark activity was slightly but significantly lower than that seen with an equivalent concentration of H1a alone (Fig. 4). However, H1c-G89N is clearly not as effective in suppressing the enhanced Ca2+ spark frequency elicited by H1-EVH1 short-form when compared with the suppression observed with H1c-G89N + H1c. Taken together these results support a role for the CC domain in the enhanced effectiveness of a given concentration of H1c compared with H1-EVH1 toward activating Ca2+ sparks in this system. In order to further test this hypothesis, 6.25 nm H1c (long form) was pre-equilibrated with 30 nm H1-EVH1 (short form), and the fiber was challenged with the mixture. This condition resulted in an additive effect between long and short forms toward enhancing Ca2+ spark frequency (∼6-fold over control levels; Fig. 4). This level of activation is consistent with a purely additive action between H1c (∼3.5-fold) and H1-EVH1 (∼2.5-fold) when presented individually. This is consistent with each of the individual proteins being within the linear concentration range for spark activation and with no interaction between H1c and H1-EVH1 proteins.

To clarify this issue, we have examined the functional interaction between BRCA1 and ZBRK1, a BRCA1-dependent KRAB eight zinc finger transcriptional repressor. We report here the identification and molecular characterization of a portable BRCA1-dependent transcriptional repression domain within ZBRK1 composed of zinc fingers 5-8 along with sequences in the unique ZBRK1 C terminus. This C-terminal repression domain functions in a BRCA1-, histone deacetylase-, and promoter-specific manner and is thus functionally distinguishable from the N-terminal KRAB repression domain in ZBRK1, which exhibits no BRCA1 dependence and broad promoter specificity. Significantly, we also find that the BRCA1-dependent transcriptional repression domain on ZBRK1 includes elements that modulate its sequence-specific DNA binding activity. These findings thus reveal the presence within ZBRK1 of functionally bipartite zinc fingers with dual roles in sequence-specific DNA-binding and BRCA1-dependent transcriptional repression.

Several potentially overlapping cellular activities have been ascribed to BRCA1, each of which could underlie its ability to control signal output.

The extent to which these pleiotropic activities contribute to the caretaker function of BRCA1 is presently unknown; however, the fact that each of these BRCA1-associated activities are similarly abrogated by cancer-predisposing BRCA1 missense mutations suggests a strong correlative link between their discharge and BRCA1-mediated tumor suppression.With respect to its role in transcription control, BRCA1 has been implicated in both activation and repression of genes linked to a variety of biological processes, including cell growth control and DNA replication and repair (21Harkin D.P.

Thus, by virtue of its transcriptional regulatory activity, BRCA1 could influence cellular responses downstream of DNA damage signals, and this activity could contribute to its caretaker function.The precise role of BRCA1 in gene-specific transcription control has yet to be definitively established. Because it exhibits no sequence-specific DNA binding activity, it seems likely that BRCA1 is targeted to specific genes through its functional interaction with sequence-specific DNA-binding transcription factors. Direct evidence to support this hypothesis has come from the identification of multiple DNA-binding transcription factors with which BRCA1 has been shown to physically interact and functionally synergize, including p53, c-Myc, estrogen receptor α, androgen receptor, OCT-1, NF-YA, and ZBRK1 (32Fan W.

However, the underlying mechanism by which BRCA1 mediates the transcriptional stimulatory or repressive effects of these regulatory proteins has not been established.We have been studying the functional interaction between BRCA1 and the transcriptional repressor ZBRK1 as a model system to understand the mechanistic basis by which BRCA1 mediates sequence-specific transcription control. Initially identified by virtue of its physical interaction with BRCA1, ZBRK1 (Zinc finger and BRCA1-interacting protein with a KRAB domain 1) is a member of the Kruppel-associated box-zinc finger protein (KRAB-ZFP) family of transcriptional repressors (39Zheng L.

Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 3609-3615Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). Typically, KRAB-ZFPs bind to their corresponding target genes through tandem C-terminal C2H2 zinc fingers and repress transcription through an N-terminal KRAB domain, which silences gene expression through the indirect recruitment of histone deacetylases, histone methyltransferases, and heterochromatin proteins (41Collins T.

Like other KRAB-ZFPs, ZBRK1 harbors an N-terminal KRAB domain. However, ZBRK1 is atypical among KRAB-ZFPs due to the fact that it harbors 8 central C2H2 zinc fingers and a unique C terminus that is absent among the larger family of KRAB-ZFPs.Through its 8 central zinc fingers, ZBRK1 binds to a compositionally flexible 15-bp DNA sequence, GGGxxxCAGxxxTTT (where x is any nucleotide) (39Zheng L.

A search for potential ZBRK1 DNA-binding sites in existing genes led to intron 3 of GADD45a, a functionally important DNA damage-response effector known to be regulated transcriptionally by BRCA1 (21Harkin D.P.

Functional analysis revealed that ZBRK1 represses GADD45a gene transcription through its intron 3 DNA-binding site in a BRCA1-dependent manner, thus revealing BRCA1 to be a ZBRK1 co-repressor (39Zheng L.

Significantly, familial breast cancer-derived mutants of BRCA1 that disrupt its interaction with ZBRK1 abrogate its co-repressor activity, suggesting that its co-repressor function may be important for the tumor suppressor properties of BRCA1 (39Zheng L.

The regulation of GADD45a gene transcription is likely to be complex and controlled coordinately by ZBRK1 and BRCA1 in concert with other transacting factors, including p53, OCT1, and NF-YA, that function through cis-acting sequences present in the GADD45a promoter and intron 3 regions (21Harkin D.P.

This observation suggests a potentially broader role for BRCA1 and ZBRK1 in the coordinate transcriptional regulation of diverse DNA damage-response genes. To begin to explore the mechanism by which BRCA1 mediates sequence-specific transcriptional repression through ZBRK1, we have pursued in greater depth the physical and functional interaction between these two proteins. We report here the identification and molecular characterization of a portable BRCA1-dependent transcriptional repression domain within ZBRK1 composed of zinc fingers 5-8 along with sequences in the unique ZBRK1 C terminus. This C-terminal repression domain functions in a BRCA1-, histone deacetylase (HDAC)-, 1The abbreviations used are: HDAC, histone deacetylase; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay; MEFs, mouse embryo fibroblasts; aa, amino acids; MBP, maltose-binding protein; PMSF, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride; TSA, trichostatin A; ZRE, ZBRK1-response element; BF, broken finger; TK, thymidine kinase; WT, wild type; Mut., mutant; HSV, herpes simplex virus. 1The abbreviations used are: HDAC, histone deacetylase; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay; MEFs, mouse embryo fibroblasts; aa, amino acids; MBP, maltose-binding protein; PMSF, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride; TSA, trichostatin A; ZRE, ZBRK1-response element; BF, broken finger; TK, thymidine kinase; WT, wild type; Mut., mutant; HSV, herpes simplex virus. and promoter-specific manner and is thus functionally distinguishable from the N-terminal KRAB repression domain in ZBRK1, which exhibits no BRCA1 dependence and broad promoter specificity. Significantly, we also find that the BRCA1-dependent C-terminal transcriptional repression domain within ZBRK1 is composed of elements that modulate sequence-specific DNA-binding by zinc fingers 1-4. These findings thus reveal an unanticipated dual function for the ZBRK1 zinc fingers in DNA binding and transcriptional repression, and further shed new light on the mechanistic role of BRCA1 in sequence-specific transcriptional control.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESPlasmid Construction and MutagenesisExpression Plasmids—pMAL-C2-TEV-ZBRK1 ΔK for expressing MBP-ZBRK1 ΔK in Escherichia coli was derived from pGEPK3-ZBRK1 ΔK, which is a derivative of pCNF-ZBRK1 ΔK (39Zheng L.

Briefly, a BamHI-XhoI fragment carrying ZBRK1 cDNA sequences encoding ZBRK1 amino acids 144-532 (lacking the N-terminal KRAB domain) was subcloned into the BamHI and XhoI sites of pMAL-C2-TEV (provided by Dr. P. Renee Yew), thereby generating a translational fusion of MBP and ZBRK1 ΔK. C-terminal truncation mutants of MBP-ZBRK1 ΔK bearing stepwise deletions of individual ZBRK1 zinc fingers were expressed from pMAL-C2-TEV-ZBRK1 ΔK deletion derivatives, each of which was constructed by PCR-based subcloning. Briefly, sequences encoding ZBRK1 ΔK within pMAL-C2-TEV-ZBRK1 ΔK were liberated as a BamHI-HindIII fragment and replaced with corresponding PCR-generated ZBRK1 deletion fragments using a common upstream primer corresponding to MBP sequences and unique downstream primers within the C terminus of each zinc finger (defined here as the seventh amino acid residue C-terminal to the last histidine residue of each C2H2 zinc finger). Individual MBP-ZBRK1 ΔK deletion derivatives encode the following ZBRK1 amino acids (aa): MBP-ZBRK1 ΔK 8ZF (aa 144-431); 7ZF (aa 144-403); 6ZF (aa 144-377); 5ZF (aa 144-347); 4ZF (aa 144-319); 3ZF (aa 144-291); 2ZF (aa 144-263); and 1ZF (aa 144-235). Individual MBP-ZBRK1 ΔK broken finger (BF) mutants were generated by PCR-based site-directed mutagenesis of pMAL-C2-TEV-ZBRK1 ΔK using the QuickChange II site-directed mutagenesis kit following the manufacturer's recommendations (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Each broken finger mutant bears a histidine (CAT codon) to asparagine (aaT codon) substitution mutation at the first of the two conserved histidine residues within the targeted C2H2 zinc finger.ZBRK1 5ZFC was expressed as a GAL4 DNA-binding domain fusion in mammalian cells from the plasmid GAL4-ZBRK1 5ZFC, constructed by subcloning a PCR-amplified ZBRK1 cDNA fragment encoding amino acids 319-532 (encompassing zinc finger 5 through the C terminus) into the SalI and HindIII sites of pM (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA). N- and C-terminal truncation derivatives of GAL4-ZBRK1 5ZFC bearing stepwise deletions of individual zinc fingers and C-terminal sequences, respectively, were generated by PCR-based subcloning. Briefly, the SalI-HindIII fragment within GAL4-ZBRK1 5ZFC encoding ZBRK1 5ZFC was replaced with corresponding PCR-generated ZBRK1 deletion fragments. Individual GAL4-ZBRK1 5ZFC deletion derivatives encode the following ZBRK1 amino acids (aa): GAL4-ZBRK1 6ZFC (aa 347-532); 7ZFC (aa 375-532); 8ZFC (aa 403-532); C (aa 431-532); GAL4-ZBRK1 5ZFC Δ1 (aa 319-523); 5ZFC Δ2 (aa 319-503); and 5ZFC Δ3 (aa 319-483). Broken finger derivatives of GAL4-ZBRK1 5ZFC were generated by PCR amplification of ZBRK1 sequences encoding amino acids 319-532 from individual pMAL-C2-TEV ZBRK1 ΔK BF mutants and subsequent replacement of the SalI-HindIII wild-type ZBRK1 fragment in GAL4-ZBRK1 5ZFC.ZBRK1 5ZFC and its truncation and broken finger derivatives were expressed in yeast as GAL4 activation domain fusions using pGADT7 (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA). Briefly, ZBRK1 5ZFC and its truncation (6ZFC, 7ZFC, 8ZFC, 0ZFC, 5ZFC Δ1, 5ZFC Δ2, and 5ZFC Δ3) and broken finger (BF5, BF6, BF7, and BF8) derivatives were excised as BamHI-blunted SalI fragments from GAL4-ZBRK1 5ZFC and its corresponding derivative plasmids, and subcloned into the BamHI and blunted XhoI sites in pGADT7. A BRCA1 cDNA fragment (encoding amino acids 341-748) encompassing the ZBRK1-binding domain (39Zheng L. Pan H. Li S. Flesken-Nikitin A. Chen P.L. Boyer T.G. Lee W.H. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 757-768Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar) was PCR-amplified and subcloned into the EcoRI and SalI sites of pGBKT7, thereby generating a translational fusion of the GAL4 DNA-binding domain with BRCA1 amino acids 341-748 in the plasmid pGBKT7-BRCA1.The ZBRK1 KRAB domain was expressed as a GAL4 DNA-binding domain fusion in mammalian cells from GAL4-ZBRK1 KRAB, constructed by subcloning a PCR-amplified ZBRK1 cDNA fragment encoding amino acids 1-85 into the BamHI and blunted XbaI sites of pM2 (50Sadowski I. Bell B. Broad P. Hollis M. Gene (Amst.). 1992; 118: 137-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). All PCR-based subcloning was performed using Pfu DNA polymerase (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA), and the integrity of individual deletion and substitution mutations was confirmed by DNA sequence analysis.Reporter Plasmids—pG5TK-Luc carrying five copies of the GAL4 DNA-binding site upstream of the herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase (TK) promoter (sequences corresponding to -105 to +51, where +1 is the transcription start site) driving expression of the gene encoding firefly luciferase was constructed by replacing a HindIII-BglII fragment from pSBS-GAL-TK-Luc (provided by Dr. Tony Ip) with a HindIII-BglII fragment from pG5TK-CAT (provided by Dr. P. Renee Yew), thus positioning five copies of the GAL4 DNA-binding site and the TK promoter upstream of the firefly luciferase gene. pG5SV40-Luc carrying five GAL4 DNA-binding sites upstream of the SV40 promoter driving expression of the firefly luciferase gene has been described previously (39Zheng L.

Wade) carries five GAL4 DNA-binding sites upstream of the human small nuclear ribonucleoprotein N promoter driving expression of the firefly luciferase gene (51Fujita N. Jaye D.L. Kajita M.

Briefly, cells were grown at 37 °C to an A600 of 0.6. Isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was added to a final concentration 0.3 mm, and the cells were transferred to 25 °C for another 3.5 h. Cells were pelleted, washed once with phosphate-buffered saline, and then resuspended in MBP binding buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5; 1 mm EDTA; 200 mm NaCl; 20 μm ZnCl2; and 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol) supplemented with protease inhibitors (aprotinin 0.4 μg/ml; chymostatin 0.5 μg/ml; leupeptin 0.5 μg/ml; pepstatin 0.5 μg/ml; PMSF 0.5 mm; and benzamidine-HCl 0.5 mm). Resuspended cells were frozen and thawed one time, followed by sonication (3 times for 1 min) and clarification by centrifugation at 30,000 × g for 30 min. MBP-ZBRK1 fusion proteins were purified from clarified lysates by affinity chromatography on amylose resin (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA). Briefly, clarified lysates were incubated with amylose resin in batch for 1 h at 4 °C, washed 3 times with MBP binding buffer, and then eluted with MBP binding buffer containing 0.5% maltose for 30 min at 4 °C. Purified proteins (estimated to be >95% homogeneous by SDS-PAGE and subsequent visualization by Coomassie Blue staining) were dialyzed for 1 h at 4 °C against EMSA storage buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5; 100 mm NaCl; 20 μm ZnCl2; 10% glycerol; 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol; and 0.5 mm PMSF) before long term storage at -80 °C.Electrophretic Mobility Shift Assay (EMSA)For EMSA, the ZRE probe was obtained by annealing two complementary oligonucleotides corresponding in sequence to the consensus ZBRK1 DNA-binding site: 5′-GATCCACGGGACGCAGGTGTTTTGTGCCG-3′ and 5′-GATCCGGCACAAAACACCTGCGTCCCGTG-3′ (39Zheng L.

Each of these double-stranded probes carried overhanging ends, which were filled in with [α-32P]dCTP by Klenow enzyme. In each reaction, purified MBP-ZBRK1 fusion proteins (50 ng) were incubated with 6000 cpm of a 32P-labeled double-stranded oligonucleotide probe in 30 μl of EMSA binding buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl pH 7.5; 20 μm ZnCl2; 12.5% glycerol; 0.5 mm PMSF; and a variable concentration of NaCl as indicated). Following 30 min of incubation at room temperature, reaction mixtures were loaded onto a 5% non-denaturing polyacrylamide gel and electrophoresed at 200 V for 2 h at 4 °C in 0.5× TBE. Dried gels were subjected to PhosphorImager analysis (Amersham Biosciences).Cell Culture, Transfections, and Reporter AssaysBrca1-/-, p53-/- (Brca1-/-), and p53-/- (Brca1+/+) mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEFs) (39Zheng L.

https://openalex.org/W2082554751,"Bioactivation of prohormones occurs in the granules of the regulated secretory pathway of endocrine cells, which release hormones in response to external stimulation. How secretory granules are formed and how the cargo is selected is still unclear, but it has been shown for several prohormones and processing enzymes that domains within the prohormone structure can act as “sorting signals” for this pathway. The domains mediate interactions with other proteins or with the membrane or facilitate aggregation of the (pro)peptides. We have now searched for domains in progastrin that are active in sorting the prohormone into secretory granules. Truncation studies showed that the N-terminal 30 residues of progastrin are dispensable, whereas the last 49 residues are sufficient for correct biosynthesis of bioactive gastrin. Thus, further N-terminal truncation abolished gastrin expression. C-terminal truncation of 8 residues resulted in an increase in basal secretion as did point mutations in the dibasic processing sites of progastrin. These mutants, however, still responded to secretagogues, suggesting a residual sorting capacity to the regulated pathway. Amino acid substitutions in an acidic, polyglutamate motif within gastrin-17, the main bioactive, cellular gastrin form, did not alter secretion per se, but when these residues were substituted in C-terminally truncated mutants, double mutants increased in basal secretion and did not respond to secretagogue stimulation. This implies that the mutants are constitutively secreted. Our data suggest that the dibasic processing sites constitute the most important sorting domain of progastrin, and these sites act in synergy with the acidic domain.

Our data suggest that the dibasic processing sites constitute the most important sorting domain of progastrin, and these sites act in synergy with the acidic domain. Peptide hormones are potent signaling molecules that regulate biological key functions. Accordingly, active peptides are primarily synthesized as inactive precursors, and later, after processing to the bioactive peptides, stored in specialized granules to be secreted only after appropriate external stimuli. In the granules belonging to the regulated secretory pathway (1Kelly R.B. Science. 1985; 230: 25-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (760) Google Scholar), prohormones are activated by sequential enzymatic reactions including specific endoproteolysis by specific prohormone convertases (2Seidah N.G. Chretien M. Brain Res. 1999; 848: 45-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (689) Google Scholar, 3Zhou A. Webb G. Zhu X. Steiner D.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20745-20748Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar). Thus, the correct sorting of prohormones into the granules is a prerequisite for both activation and timing of hormonal signaling. The mechanism behind the sorting of prohormones to secretory granules has been debated extensively in recent years (for reviews, see Refs. 4Arvan P. Castle D. Biochem. J. 1998; 332: 593-610Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar, 5Thiele C. Gerdes H.H. Huttner W.B. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: R496-R500Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Dannies P.S. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 2001; 177: 87-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 7Gorr S.U. Jain R.K.

Acta. 1998; 1404: 231-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Basically, two models exist for the sorting of cargo to the secretory granules, the “sorting for entry” and the “sorting by retention” models (4Arvan P. Castle D. Biochem. J. 1998; 332: 593-610Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar). With the former model, entry to the immature secretory granules is the main point of sorting, whereas the latter model proposes that peptides for regulated secretion are retained in immature secretory granules from which other proteins and peptides are removed and constitutively secreted. Several different sorting mechanisms exist that can be utilized differently depending on the cell type and protein to be sorted (7Gorr S.U. Jain R.K. Kuehn U. Joyce P.B. Cowley D.J. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 2001; 172: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Calcium-mediated aggregation of proteins is important for sorting proinsulin, proatrial natriuretic factor, and chromogranin A to the regulated pathway (9Kuliawat R. Prabakaran D. Arvan P. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 1959-1972Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 10Kuliawat R. Arvan P. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 118: 521-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 11Shields P.P. Sprenkle A.B.

Chem. 2000; 275: 7743-7748Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). However, aggregation is not the only factor in cargo selection and regulation of protein sorting (6Dannies P.S. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 2001; 177: 87-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 7Gorr S.U. Jain R.K. Kuehn U. Joyce P.B. Cowley D.J. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 2001; 172: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). A “sorting receptor” that recognizes specific domains of cargo proteins and selects these for secretory granules has also been proposed. One candidate for such a receptor, carboxypeptidase E, has been proposed to be involved in the sorting of proopiomelanocortin, proenkephalin, and proinsulin to the regulated pathway (13Cool D.R. Normant E. Shen F. Chen H.C. Pannell L. Zhang Y. Loh Y.P. Cell. 1997; 88: 73-83Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar, 14Cool D.R. Loh Y.P. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1998; 139: 7-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Proopiomelanocortin contains a hydrophobic, disulfide loop that is thought to interact with specific residues of carboxypeptidase E (15Zhang C.F. Snell C.R. Loh Y.P. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 13: 527-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), and sorting is then mediated by membrane attachment of carboxypeptidase E (16Dhanvantari S. Loh Y.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29887-29893Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 17Dhanvantari S. Arnaoutova I. Snell C.R. Steinbach P.J. Hammond K. Caputo G.A. London E. Loh Y.P. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 52-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). In chromogranin A and B, similar loops mediate sorting via membrane binding and not by binding carboxypeptidase E (18Yoo S.H. Lewis M.S. FEBS Lett. 1998; 427: 55-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 19Glombik M.M. Kromer A. Salm T. Huttner W.B. Gerdes H.H. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1059-1070Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). This is also the case in the sorting of two enzymes localized in regulatory granules, the prohormone convertases 1/3 and 2 (20Jutras I. Seidah N.G. Reudelhuber T.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40337-40343Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 21Blazquez M. Thiele C. Huttner W.B. Docherty K. Shennan K.I. Biochem. J. 2000; 349: 843-852Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Recent evidence, however, suggests that at least one additional sorting determinant is present in chromogranin A and that protein folding may be important for sorting (22Taupenot L. Harper K.L. Mahapatra N.R. Parmer R.J. Mahata S.K. O'Connor D.T. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 4827-4841Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Also, sorting determinants of other proteins have been described without the identification of binding receptors, e.g. proneuropeptide Y and proneurotensin that both require basic residues for sorting (23Brakch N. Allemandou F. Cavadas C. Grouzmann E. Brunner H.R. J. Neurochem. 2002; 81: 1166-1175Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 24Feliciangeli S. Kitabgi P. Bidard J.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 6140-6150Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The hormone gastrin is a major regulator of gastric acid secretion and gastric mucosal growth (25Dockray G.J. Varro A. Dimaline R. Wang T. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2001; 63: 119-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). Human progastrin is an 80-residue polypeptide that is cleaved by the prohormone convertases 1/3 and 2 and then C-terminally trimmed by carboxypeptidase E. Subsequent α-amidation by the amidation enzyme complex, peptidylglycine α-amidating monooxygenase, generates the acid stimulatory gastrins, gastrin-17 and gastrin-34 (see Fig. 1). We have previously established a model system to study human gastrin biosynthesis using mutagenesis (26Bundgaard J.R. Cowland J.B. Vuust J. Rehfeld J.F. DNA Cell Biol. 1996; 15: 147-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar, 27Bundgaard J.R. Vuust J. Rehfeld J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21700-21705Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). In the present study, we have analyzed the features of progastrin that are involved in sorting to the regulated secretory pathway. Using N- and C-terminal truncations and amino acid substitutions, we have found that two domains are implicated in progastrin sorting. Either one is by itself sufficient to sort progastrin to secretory granules responding to the secretagogue, 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (IBMX), 1The abbreviation used is: ! IBMX3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine.1The abbreviation used is: ! IBMX3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine. whereas double mutations abolished responsiveness to IBMX. 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine. 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine. Materials—Culture media and supplements for cell culture were obtained from Invitrogen. Enzymes and materials for PCR and molecular cloning were obtained from Roche Applied Science, New England Biolabs, or Promega. HIT-T15 cells were obtained from ATCC (Manassas, VA). Expression Vector Constructions and Mutagenesis—The expression vectors in this study were based on two different gastrin expression vectors with similar expression levels. The first utilizes the human UbB promoter to express the human gastrin gene (26Bundgaard J.R. Cowland J.B. Vuust J. Rehfeld J.F. DNA Cell Biol. 1996; 15: 147-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar), and the second expresses gastrin cDNA cloned as a PCR fragment in pcDNA3.1/Zeo (Invitrogen) from the cytomegalovirus promoter. Mutations in the human gastrin gene or cDNA were made by PCR, either by using nucleotide substitutions in primers followed by direct cloning or by using overlap PCR followed by cloning. All molecular biology methods and enzymatic treatment were conducted according to the supplier's suggestions and general molecular biology protocols. Cell Culture and Transfection—The Syrian hamster β-cell line HIT-T15 was cultured and transfected as described previously (28Bundgaard J.R. Methods Mol. Biol. 2002; 194: 291-299PubMed Google Scholar). Basically, 2 × 106 cells were seeded in 10-cm Petri dishes and transfected the following day. Media were changed the following day, and the cells were allowed 2 days for expression before harvesting. Stimulation experiments were initiated 1 day after transfection by the addition of 0.5 mm IBMX (Sigma) and incubated for peptide expression for 24 h, when cells and culture media were harvested. At harvest, culture media were recovered and, cells were removed by the addition of phosphate-buffered saline added to 2 g/liters EDTA, pelleted, and kept at -20 °C until peptide extraction. At the time of harvest, each dish contained about 2 × 107 cells. All transfection series were repeated, and data presented are from parallel transfections of four dishes. Radioimmunoassay—Cells were resuspended in 1 ml of boiling water, and culture media were extracted by boiling at neutral pH for 20 min. Cell debris was removed by centrifugation. Extracts were analyzed by radioimmunoassays using antisera 2604, which is specific for carboxyamidated gastrin, and antisera 2609, which recognizes both carboxyamidated gastrin and cholecystokinin and is less sensitive toward amino acid substitutions in the gastrin-17 sequence (29Rehfeld J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 4016-4021Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, radioimmunoassay using antibody 2609 is highly specific and has been used in previous mutational analysis of gastrin biosynthesis, including mutations closer to the 6-7 C-terminal residues of gastrin-17, which constitutes the bioactive site (27Bundgaard J.R. Vuust J. Rehfeld J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21700-21705Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). N-terminal progastrin fragments were measured using antibody 88235, which recognizes the N terminus of human gastrin-52 but cross-reacts with the N-terminally extended forms (30Rehfeld J.F. Johnsen A.H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 223: 765-773Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Radioimmunoassays were performed as described in Ref 30Rehfeld J.F. Johnsen A.H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 223: 765-773Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar. Nomenclature—The nomenclature used in this study is as follows (see Fig. 1 for residue numbering and progastrin fragment references). Any carboxyamidated fragment is denoted as gastrin and numbered after the length of the peptide fragment, e.g. gastrin-34. Other fragments are denoted after the numbering in residues. A construct is named after the structure of the unprocessed precursor. Thus, the truncated progastrin obtained after deletion of the C-terminal flanking peptide is referred to as progastrin-(1-72). Mutated progastrins are named after the structure, e.g. progastrin-(1-74)SAQNQN denotes a mutant having a wild type progastrin fragment of the first 74 residues followed by the sequence SAQNQN. Mutations in dibasic cleavage motifs are denoted with the exact amino acid substitutions. Lastly, mutations in the polyglutamate region of the gastrin-17 fragment are named after the structure of the polyglutamate stretch. Hence, progastrin-(1-72)-SSEES denotes a mutant having the five glutamates (EEEEE, see Fig. 2) substituted with SSEES and having a deletion of the C-terminal flanking peptide. The N-terminal Part of Progastrin Is Not Necessary for Sorting to the Regulated Secretory Pathway—In several prohormones, sorting domains necessary for intracellular localization to the regulated secretory pathway are localized in the N-terminal region of the prohormones. As part of the N-terminal end of progastrin is well conserved during evolution, we did N-terminal truncations to analyze whether this region is necessary for sorting to the regulated secretory pathway. We performed sequential N-terminal truncations of 10 residues of progastrin (Fig. 1), with the exception of the very N-terminal seryl residue of progastrin, which was kept intact to ensure correct removal of the signal peptide. The constructs were then transiently transfected into the Syrian hamster β-cell line, HIT-T15, and cells and media were analyzed for gastrin expression using a sequence specific gastrin radioimmunoassay. We analyzed the formation of the bioactive carboxyamidated gastrins and the ability to secrete these peptides in response to external stimuli, two hallmarks of the regulated secretory granules. To analyze regulated secretion, we used IBMX because this had proved to be the most potent secretagogue in previous experiments with HIT-T15 cells (28Bundgaard J.R. Methods Mol. Biol. 2002; 194: 291-299PubMed Google Scholar). Table I shows that truncation of the 30 most N-terminal residues of progastrin had little effect on the formation of carboxyamidated gastrin and the ability to increase secretion of amidated gastrin in response to IBMX stimulation. In contrast, removal of an additional 10 N-terminal residues severely reduced expression of carboxyamidated gastrins. These data show, on the one hand, that the N-terminal region is not necessary for formation of gastrin, and on the other hand, that the 49 most C-terminal residues are sufficient to express the active peptide and to confer responsiveness to external stimuli. We therefore concluded that the 49 C-terminal residues contain the motifs for sorting to the regulated pathway. Fig. 2 shows the structure of this 49-amino-acid human progastrin fragment aligned to the corresponding sequences of other mammalian gastrins. The fragment consists of the gastrin-34 sequence flanked by N- and C-terminal sequences, and the alignment shows that this progastrin fragment is evolutionarily well conserved. Conservation of the bioactive gastrin-17 is expected, but because the C-terminal flanking peptide is also well conserved, we performed C-terminal truncation studies to examine contributions to the intracellular sorting of this region.Table IExpression of human progastrin mutants having sequential N-terminal truncations of 10 residues (seeFig. 1) HIT-T15 was transfected in parallel and cells and culture media were analyzed for amidated gastrins (mean ± S.E., n = 4).

The construct was then expressed in HIT-T15 cells, and cellular and culture media concentrations of gastrin were analyzed. The secretion ratio of wild type gastrin and the truncated progastrin-(1-72) was calculated as the media-to-cell-content ratio. Truncation of the 8 most C-terminal residues (progastrin-(1-72)) resulted in an increase in the basal secretion ratio of gastrin, suggesting constitutive-like secretion (Fig. 3). This again suggests that the C-terminal flanking peptide contains an active sorting domain. Inspection of the 8 residues disclosed, apart from the dibasic proteolytic cleavage site, an evolutionary conserved motif of acidic residues (Fig. 2). These were point-mutated in progastrin to give progastrin-(1-74)-SAQNQN, which substitutes the acidic residues with neutral residues but still has 8 C-terminal residues in the C-terminal flanking peptide. The secretion ratios of these mutants were similar to that of the wild type, suggesting that these residues are not involved in prohormone sorting. If just the last 6 residues were truncated, leaving the dibasic motif at the C terminus, this construct, progastrin-(1-74), showed a secretion ratio similar to that of wild type gastrin (Fig. 3). This suggests that the basic residues of the C-terminal proteolytic processing site serve as a sorting domain in progastrin. Dibasic Processing Sites Are Mediating Progastrin Sorting— Finding effects of the sorting of the dibasic motif of the C-terminal flanking peptide prompted us to examine the effects of all three dibasic cleavage sites of progastrin (Fig. 1). First, we did point mutations of the dibasic cleavage sites at Arg-36-Arg-37 and Lys-53-Lys-54 to Asn-36-Asn-37 and Gln-53-Ser-54, respectively, and expressed this construct in HIT-T15 cells. The secretion ratio of amidated gastrins from this construct is shown in Fig. 4A. Basal secretion ratios of gastrins are affected by the double mutations by 2-fold, but mutant gastrins are still responsive to external stimuli, although the response is weaker. To examine the effect of all three dibasic cleavage sites, we simultaneously mutated all 3 basic residues by mutating Arg-73-Arg-74 to Asn-73-Asn-74 in addition to the two N-terminal dibasic cleavage sites. This construct was expressed and analyzed using a different assay than the gastrin assay because the mutant is incapable of processing progastrin to carboxyamidated gastrins. This assay utilizes an antiserum that recognizes the N terminus of gastrin-52, a fragment released by cleavage at Arg-19 of progastrin, but which crossreacts with progastrins unprocessed at this site. Thus, this assay would monitor the smallest mutant derivative of the progastrin mutant, progastrin (Asn-36-Asn-37,Gln-53-Ser-54,Asn-73-Asn-74). The secretion ratio of this construct is shown in Fig. 4B. Basal secretion ratios of the triple mutant showed a further increase when compared with the mutant lacking the two N-terminal processing sites and a 5-fold increase when compared with wild type gastrins. However, the fragments still responded to IBMX stimulation, suggesting that mutant peptide is still at least partially sorted to the regulated secretory pathway. The Influence of Mutations in the Polyglutamate Motif of Gastrin-17 on Prohormone Sorting—Protein aggregation is a common theme in the sorting of peptide hormones and their precursors to secretory granules. A recent report has shown that a motif within a polyglutamate stretch of gastrin-17 (Glu-61-Glu-65) binds divalent cations (31Pannequin J. Barnham K.J. Hollande F. Shulkes A. Norton R.S. Baldwin G.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 48602-48609Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). We wondered whether this sequence could mediate aggregation and thereby improve sorting to the regulated pathway. We therefore mutated the polyglutamate stretch and analyzed the expression of these constructs in HIT-T15 cells (Fig. 5A). Mutants, named after mutations in the 5 glutamate residues, showed that the basal secretion ratios of the mutants were similar to that of wild type progastrin. To further analyze any effect, we made two double mutants with mutations within the polyglutamates and truncations of the C-terminal flanking peptide. One double mutant, progastrin-(1-72)-SSESS, had 4 polyglutamates substituted with seryl residues, whereas the other, progastrin-(1-72)-SSEES, had 3 gultamates substituted. We also performed parallel transfections of single and double mutants with and without stimulation (Fig. 5B). Secretion ratios of both stimulated and unstimulated progastrin-SSESS and progastrin-SSEES were identical to those of wild type progastrin. However, when both mutants were C-terminally truncated, the basal secretion was highly increased, and the progastin-(1-72)-SSESS mutant did not repond to IBMX. Similarly, progastrin-(1-72)-SSEES only showed a weak response to secretagogue. Thus, neither of the double mutants are correctly sorted to the regulated secretory pathway, but are constitutively secreted. To mature and be secreted in response to appropriate external stimuli, prohormones need to be sorted to the regulated secretory pathway. The mechanism of this sorting event is not completely understood because different prohormones use different sorting mechanisms and because different cell lines may have different machinery for sorting into the regulated secretory pathway (7Gorr S.U. Jain R.K. Kuehn U. Joyce P.B. Cowley D.J. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 2001; 172: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). In this study, we provide evidence that human progastrin have sorting domains localized in the C-terminal region of the prohormone. Moreover, our study indicates that more than one domain is active in sorting so that progastrin can be sorted by synergistic mechanisms. N-terminal deletions showed that a signal peptide in combination with the 49 C-terminal residues is sufficient to direct progastrin to the regulated secretory pathway. Additional truncation of progastrin abolishes gastrin synthesis, suggesting that the peptides are degraded rather than sorted to the regulated pathway. A general feature of prohormones is that the precursors are considerably larger than the active hormones. It has been speculated that long polypeptides are necessary to direct the prohormones through the secretory pathway (32Docherty K. Steiner D.F. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1982; 44: 625-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar), and our studies suggest that the prohormones indeed require a length of 40-50 residues to prevent degradation in the secretory pathway. Generally, prohormones are larger than this size. The smallest prohormone we are aware of is proneuromedin B, which is 52 residues in size (33Krane I.M. Naylor S.L. Helin-Davis D. Chin W.W. Spindel E.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 13317-13323Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Together, these data suggest that the minimal size of a secreted peptide in endocrine cells will be about 50 residues. Further analysis of progastrin sorting was carried out by C-terminal deletions and specific point mutations. To assay the sorting of the peptides, we measured the intracellular concentration and related that to the media concentrations of transfected cells. This ratio is the sorting index of the mutants. Moreover, as a characteristic of the regulated granules, we examined the ability to respond to external stimuli, in this case the secretagogue IBMX. Because our experiments were carried out as steady state experiments, the sorting ratio is a relative index, and in order for these results to be constitutively secreted, we expected secretion to be independent of IBMX stimulation. To get an idea of the sorting ratio in constitutive secretion, we expressed progastrin in Chinese hamster ovary and COS cells, which lack a regulated secretory pathway, and found the secretion ratio of unprocessed progastrin in these cell lines to be 10-15 (data not shown). This ratio may, however, vary between different cell lines. C-terminal deletions and point mutations showed that the 2 basic residues located in the C-terminal flanking peptide in particular affected the secretion ratio. Similarly, we found that substitutions in the dibasic cleavage sites, Arg-36-Arg-37 and Lys-53-Lys-54,influence secretion ratios. However, although basal secretion ratios were increased when all three dibasic sites were substituted, we still observed a response to secretagogue stimulation, suggesting residual sorting to regulated granules. We therefore analyzed the influence of a motif of 5 glutamic acid residues within the gastrin-17 sequence and found no effect of these residues per se. However, when substitutions in the acidic motif were combined with C-terminal truncations, the mutant peptide was missorted to the constitutive secretory pathway. The synergistic effects of the two types of domains suggest that they contribute to sorting through different mechanisms. One mechanism depends on basic residues for sorting. Several prohormones and proteins have recently been shown to use dibasic sites as sorting domains. Examples are prosomatostatin (34Brakch N. Cohen P. Boileau G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 205: 221-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), prorenin (35Brechler V. Chu W.N. Baxter J.D. Thibault G. Reudelhuber T.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20636-20640Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), proneurotensin (24Feliciangeli S. Kitabgi P. Bidard J.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 6140-6150Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), proneuropeptide Y (23Brakch N. Allemandou F. Cavadas C. Grouzmann E. Brunner H.R. J. Neurochem. 2002; 81: 1166-1175Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), and prohormone convertase 1/3 (36Bernard N. Kitabgi P. Rovere-Jovene C. J. Neurochem. 2003; 85: 1592-1603Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The exact mechanism behind sorting mediated by basic residue is unknown, but it is noteworthy that interactions between propeptides and their processing enzymes may by themselves mediate sorting to the regulated pathway. Such a mechanism has already been proposed for the sorting of proopiomelanocortin by carboxypeptidase E (13Cool D.R. Normant E. Shen F. Chen H.C. Pannell L. Zhang Y. Loh Y.P. Cell. 1997; 88: 73-83Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar). In that case, however, contact is apparently independent of both the catalytic site of the enzyme and the target residues of the substrate (15Zhang C.F. Snell C.R. Loh Y.P. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 13: 527-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Alternatively, basic residues could interact with acidic groups of the phospholipids of the membrane (37Ben Tal N. Honig B. Peitzsch R.M. Denisov G. McLaughlin S. Biophys. J. 1996; 71: 561-575Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar) or lipid rafts, as recently suggested (36Bernard N. Kitabgi P. Rovere-Jovene C. J. Neurochem. 2003; 85: 1592-1603Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Considering the growing number of propeptides that get sorted by basic residue motifs, these possibilities will be subject for future studies. The other mechanism by which progastrin can get sorted depends on a specific domain of acidic residues that is located within the gastrin-17 sequence. This region is highly conserved in mammalian gastrins, but the only known function of the stretch of 5 glutamates is influencing tyrosine sulfation of progastrin (27Bundgaard J.R. Vuust J. Rehfeld J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21700-21705Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Tyrosine sulfation is not necessary for biological activity, but it does increase the degree of proteolytic processing at Lys-53-Lys-54 by PC2 (38Bundgaard J.R. Vuust J. Rehfeld J.F. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3073-3079Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 39Rehfeld J.F. Lindberg I. Friis-Hansen L. FEBS Lett. 2002; 510: 89-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). However, previous studies have shown that dramatic substitutions can be made in this region without affecting sulfation, suggesting that conservation of this domain is independent of tyrosine sulfation requirements (27Bundgaard J.R. Vuust J. Rehfeld J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21700-21705Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Instead, it has recently been shown that the acidic residues are implicated in binding divalent cations such as ferric ions (31Pannequin J. Barnham K.J. Hollande F. Shulkes A. Norton R.S. Baldwin G.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 48602-48609Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Thus, two ferric ions are bound by Glu-62 and Glu-63-Glu-64, respectively. In relation to our mutants, this implies that progastrin-SSEES can bind a single ferric ion, whereas progastrin-SSESS is incapable of binding ferric ions. When expressed as double mutants lacking the C-terminal flanking peptide, the former mutant is a weak responder to secretagogue and the latter does not respond, suggesting that ion binding indeed may play a role in progastrin sorting. This finding is potentially important for understanding of another well described mechanism of sorting propeptides to the regulated pathway, protein aggregation. It is well known that binding of zinc ions is important for storage of insulin in pancreatic secretory granules (40Emdin S.O. Dodson G.G. Cutfield J.M. Cutfield S.M. Diabetologia. 1980; 19: 174-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar), and calcium ions are important for aggregation of members of the granin family (41Chanat E. Huttner W.B. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 1505-1519Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar, 42Gerdes H.H. Rosa P. Phillips E. Baeuerle P.A. Frank R. Argos P. Huttner W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 12009-12015Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 43Gorr S.U. Shioi J. Cohn D.V. Am. J. Physiol. 1989; 257: E247-E254PubMed Google Scholar). We therefore suggest that the stretch of 5 glutamates in progastrin may contribute in a similar manner to the aggregation of progastrin. A similar mechanism was described in the sorting of atrial natriuretic peptide to secretory granules. In this case, sorting is mediated by aggregation that requires a diacidic motif in the proregion of the propeptide (44Canaff L. Brechler V. Reudelhuber T.L. Thibault G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 9483-9487Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Two models exist to describe the mechanism behind sorting to the regulated secretory pathway, the sorting for entry and the sorting by retention models (4Arvan P. Castle D. Biochem. J. 1998; 332: 593-610Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar). Although we describe elements mediating the sorting of progastrin, the identification of these sorting signals does not support or exclude either model. It is, however, striking that we identify two signals with unequal potency as sorting signals that act in synergy. This might suggest two steps of sorting that are temporally and/or spatially separated, and that both are active in HIT-T15 cells. In conclusion, these results suggest that the dibasic processing sites constitute the primary sorting domains of progastrin as mutations in these sites directly affect basal secretion of gastrin. In addition, progastrin may be sorted by an acidic motif that we propose is involved in aggregation. The two types of domains act in synergy to sort progastrin to the regulated secretory pathway.

The macromolecular substrate starch most probably also interacts with distinct areas outside the cleft as suggested by oligosaccharide occupation at so-called surface or secondary sites in several structures from GH-H (10Kadziola A.

This additional substrate binding is only proven, however, for starch binding domains of family 20 (afmb.cnrs-mrs.fr/CAZY/) found in ∼10% of the GH13 members (32Janecek S. Svensson B. MacGregor E.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 2003; 270: 635-645Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Barley α-amylase 1 (AMY1) and AMY2 are among the most thoroughly described α-amylases. The isozymes are synthesized in the seed aleurone layer during germination (33Rogers J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3731-3738Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). They share 80% sequence identity and differ in activity, stability, and natural abundance (6MacGregor A.W. Morgan J.E. MacGregor E.A. Carbohydr.

The subsite map of both isozymes contains 10 consecutive subsites of varying affinity, i.e. subsites –6 through –1 from the catalytic site toward the non-reducing and subsites +1 through +4 toward the reducing end of the substrate (5Ajandouz E.H. Abe J. Svensson B. Marchis-Mouren G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1159: 193-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Consistent with this subsite organization barley α-amylases release mainly oligosaccharides of DP 6–8 from starch (5Ajandouz E.H. Abe J. Svensson B. Marchis-Mouren G. Biochim. Biophys.

Few studies address GH-H substrate-subsite interactions far from the catalytic site (16Uitdehaag J.C. van der Veen B.A. Dijkhuizen L. Elber R. Dijkstra B.W.

Subsite –6 in CGTase, however, was shown to control transglycosylation through induced fit at the catalytic site leading to formation of cyclodextrins by cyclization of the substrate glycone moiety (16Uitdehaag J.C. van der Veen B.A. Dijkhuizen L.

The purpose of the present site-directed mutagenesis in AMY1 is to describe functional roles of the outermost subsites. A maltodecaose complex was computed earlier by stepwise addition of glucosyl residues extending the acarbose molecule bound in AMY2 (10Kadziola A. Søgaard M. Svensson B. Haser R. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 278: 205-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar) beyond subsites –1 and +2. This complex revealed that Tyr104AMY2 and Tyr211AMY2 delimit the binding groove at subsites –6 and +4 (5Ajandouz E.H. Abe J. Svensson B. Marchis-Mouren G. Biochim. Biophys.

The present incorporation and removal of aromatic residues at these positions in AMY1 thus manipulate common features in protein-carbohydrate interactions, i.e. stacking of aromatic side chains on carbohydrate rings and hydrogen bonding by the tyrosine γOH or tryptophan ∈NH to carbohydrate OH groups (26Vyas N.K.

Biochem. 2000; 267: 6903-6913PubMed Google Scholar). The enzymatic activities on starch, a short-chain amylose DP17, and various oligosaccharides of the eight mutants of AMY1 residues Tyr105 and Thr212 at subsites –6 and +4, including the AMY2 mimic [T212Y]AMY1, were interpreted using structural models established by AMY1/maltododecaose docking. Protein engineering at outer subsites turned out to have a great potential for manipulation of substrate and product specificities. Escherichia coli DH5α (Invitrogen) was used for standard cloning and Pichia pastoris GS115, pPIC3K, and pHIL-D2 (Invitrogen) for AMY1 expression; pHIL-D2α1 harboring AMY1 cDNA was an in-house stock (54Juge N. Andersen J.S. Tull D. Roepstorff P. Svensson B. Protein Expr. Purif. 1996; 8: 204-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). AMY1 cDNA clone E (38Rogers J.C. Milliman C. J. Biol.

Bio/Technology. 1993; 11: 1162-1165Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) was a gift from John C. Rogers (Washington State University, Pullman). AMY1 cDNA is subcloned from pHIL-D2α1 at EcoRI sites into the pALTER-1 mutagenesis vector (Promega) to give pALTER-α1. The EcoRI sites were used to subclone mutant AMY1 cDNA into p9000, a pPIC3K P. pastoris expression vector with bp 943–958 deleted upstream of the multiple cloning site to get AMY1 in-frame. p9000α1 containing wild-type AMY1 cDNA was constructed using the EcoRI sites. Three mutagenic primers (mutations in bold) 5′-TAGCCGCGGCATCTTCTGCATCTTCGAGGGC-3′ (Y105F), 5′-GGACAATATGGCCCCCGGCGGCGACGGCAAG-3′ (T212P), and 5′-GGACAATATGGCCTGGGGCGGCGACGGCAAG-3′ (T212W) were used (Altered Sites II System, Promega). Other mutants were made by megaprimer PCR (56Landt O. Grunert H.P. Hahn U. Gene (Amst.). 1990; 96: 125-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (639) Google Scholar) (DNA Engine Thermocycler, MJ Research). An upstream BamHI site (underlined) in the coding strand primer 5′-TTTGGATCCATGGGGAAGAACGGC-3′, and a downstream EcoRI site (underlined) in the template strand primer 5′-TTTGAATTCAGTGCAGACTTCAGCTCC-3′ were used to subclone AMY1 cDNA into pPIC3K to get pPIC3Kα1. Mutant cDNA fragments were made using internal primers 5′-TAGCCGCGCATCGCCTGCATCTTCGAGGGC-3′ (Y105A), 5′-TAGCCGCGGCATCTGGTGCATCTTCGAGGGC-3′ (Y105W), and 5′-GGACAATATGGCCTACGGCGGCGACGGCAAG-3′ (T212Y). Double mutants were constructed by subcloning a DNA fragment encoding Y105A into the T212(Y/W) expression vectors. Standard recombinant DNA techniques were used (57Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual.2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar), and sequences were confirmed by chain terminator sequencing (58Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52770) Google Scholar) using a 377-DNA Sequenator or ABI PRISM 310 Genetic analyzer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Mutated pPIC3Kα1 or p9000α1 (∼40 μg) was linearized by BglII (Promega) prior to electroporation of P. pastoris followed by plate screening on MD (minimal dextrose; 1.34% YNB, 2% glucose, 0.4 μg × ml–1 d-biotin, 1.5% agar) for His+ phenotype, MM (as MD, but with 0.5% glucose replacing methanol) for Muts (methanol slow utilization) phenotype, indicating integration of the expression cassette into the AOX1 locus, and MM, 2% soluble potato starch, to detect secretion of active α-amylase (39Mori H.

Transformants were grown (600 ml of BMGY: 0.1 m potassium phosphate, pH 6.0, 0.67% YNB, 0.4 μg × ml–1 d-biotin, 1% glycerol, 1% yeast extract, 2% peptone) in 5-liter flasks with shaking (30 °C, 225 rpm, 2 days) to OD600 ≈20. Cells were harvested (20 °C, 1500 rpm, 8 min, Beckman J6-MC centrifuge), resuspended for induction (300 ml of BMMY, as BMGY but with 0.5% methanol replacing glycerol), and grown (24 h). α-Amylase activity (Phadebas test; Amersham Biosciences) and AMY1 amounts (estimated from silver-stained SDS-PAGE using purified AMY1 as standard) were monitored in supernatants (54Juge N. Andersen J.S. Tull D. Roepstorff P. Svensson B. Protein Expr. Purif. 1996; 8: 204-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). P. pastoris secreted 6–85 mg × liter–1 AMY1 mutants and wild type. Cell harvest and induction were repeated up to three times. The combined supernatants were added 5% (w/v) (NH4)2SO4, 0.02% NaN3, applied to β-cyclodextrin-Sepharose (diameter 2.6 cm; 20 mm sodium acetate, pH 5.5, 25 mm CaCl2; 1 ml resin per mg AMY1) (37Søgaard M.

Fractions with activity were pooled, concentrated to 2 mg × ml–1 (Centriprep, 10 kDa cut-off, Millipore), dialyzed (10 mm MES, pH 6.7, 25 mm CaCl2), added 0.02% NaN3, and stored at 4 °C. SDS-PAGE (10–15%) and IEF (pH 4–6.5) (Phast-System, Amersham Biosciences) of 0.2–0.5 μg of protein were silver stained (39Mori H. Bak-Jensen K.S. Gottschalk T.E. Motawia M.S. Damager I. Moller B.L.

Gene. 1990; 94: 173-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). AMY1 mutants and wild type migrated as single bands of Mr ∼45,000 (SDS-PAGE) but gave three major bands of pI 4.7–5.1 in IEF. This pattern always recurs for recombinant AMY1 due to inactivating glutathionylation of C95 and C-terminal trimming (39Mori H. Bak-Jensen K.S. Gottschalk T.E. Motawia M.S. Damager I. Moller B.L.

https://openalex.org/W2101003419,"Rescue of embryonic lethality in MDM4-/- mice through concomitant loss of p53 has revealed a functional partnership between the two proteins. Biochemical studies have suggested that MDM4 may act as a negative regulator of p53 levels and activity. On the other hand, MDM4 overexpression has been reported to stabilize p53 levels and to counteract MDM2-degradative activity. We have investigated the functional role of MDM4 overexpression on cell behavior. In both established and primary cells cultured under stress conditions, overexpression of MDM4 significantly increased p53-dependent cell death, in correlation with enhanced induction of the endogenous p53 protein levels. This phenomenon was associated with induced p53 transcriptional activity and increased levels of the proapoptotic protein, Bax. Further, p53 stabilization was accompanied by decreased association of the protein to its negative regulator, MDM2. These findings reveal a novel role for MDM4 by demonstrating that in non-tumor cells under stress conditions it may act as a positive regulator of p53 activity, mainly by controlling p53 levels. They also indicate a major distinction between the biological consequences of MDM4 and MDM2 overexpression.

Following different stress conditions, the p53 protein is stabilized and functionally activated, resulting in two main outcomes: cell cycle arrest or apoptosis (1Levine A.J. Cell. 1997; 88: 323-331Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6759) Google Scholar). To ensure a proper cell growth under physiological conditions, p53 function is tightly controlled by maintaining the protein at low levels and partially inactive (1Levine A.J.

The cross-talk between MDM4 and p53 has been established by the analysis of knock-out mice; the MDM4-/- mouse is characterized by embryonic lethality, whereas the double knock-out p53-/-MDM4-/- mouse is alive and develops normally (6Parant J.

The comparison of MDM4-/- and MDM2-/- mice, both characterized by embryonic lethality and rescued by simultaneous knock-out of the p53 gene, has revealed a main difference in the determinants of lethality; MDM4-/- embryos do not develop beyond 7–11 days due to loss of cell proliferation, whereas MDM2-/- embryos die by massive apoptosis at the blastula stage (6Parant J.

These results, while confirming a role for MDM4 and MDM2 as major regulators of p53 activity, suggest that the two proteins act in nonoverlapping pathways, regulating p53 function in different ways.

However, a recent report demonstrated that in the absence of MDM4, MDM2 degrades p53 less efficiently (13Gu J. Kawai H. Nie L. Kitao H. Wiederschain D. Yuan Z.M. J. Biol.

Biochemical studies based on transient overexpression of MDM4 in different cell types, have revealed two distinct activities of the protein toward p53: (i) inhibition of p53 transacting activity (5Shvarts A.

The apparent contradiction between the latter effect and the hypothesis that MDM4 is a negative regulator of p53 levels has been partially solved by Gu et al. (13Gu J. Kawai H. Nie L. Kitao H.

Chem. 2002; 31: 19251-19254Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (212) Google Scholar), who have shown that the effects on p53 levels depend on the relative ratio of MDM4 and MDM2. Antagonism of p53 degradation prevails when MDM4 levels largely exceed those of MDM2, whereas in all of the other conditions, the two proteins cooperate in the degradation of p53 (13Gu J. Kawai H.

Since MDM2 levels vary within the cell depending upon stress signals of different intensity (20Latonen L. Taya Y. Laiho M.

The negative regulation of p53 transactivating properties appears to depend on the presence of MDM2 (13Gu J. Kawai H. Nie L. Kitao H. Wiederschain D. Yuan Z.M. J. Biol.

In turn, stress conditions as well as p53 activation induce nuclear translocation of overexpressed MDM4 (26Li C. Chen L. Chen J. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 22: 7562-7571Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). However, the effects of MDM4 on p53 transactivating function under these conditions have not been examined. In order to investigate the biological consequences of MDM4 on p53 function, we overexpressed MDM4 cDNA in different cells expressing endogenous wild-type (WT) 1The abbreviations used are: WT, wild-type; HF, human fibroblast(s); HEK, human embryonic kidney cell(s); MEF, mouse embryo fibroblast(s); Dox, doxycycline; Ab, antibody; Adr, adriamycin; hMDM4, human MDM4; CREB, cAMP-response element-binding protein; TUNEL, terminal dUTP nick end labeling. p53 and normal levels of MDM2. Our results show that in NIH3T3 cells, stable overexpression of MDM4 per se does not alter p53 basal levels; nor does it confer a proliferative advantage or increase colony-forming ability. On the contrary, under stress conditions, MDM4 overexpression enhances cell death, a phenomenon that correlates with increased p53 protein levels and transcriptional activity and with increased dissociation of p53 from its negative regulator MDM2. Similarly, overexpression of human MDM4 in human primary cells (human fibroblasts (HF) and human embryo kidney (HEK) cells) causes significant decrease of cell viability correlated with enhanced p53 induction and activity following adriamycin treatment, whereas no effects were observed in MEF p53-/-. These results provide evidence for a potential new role for MDM4 as a positive regulator of p53 function under stress conditions and indicate a major distinction between MDM4 and MDM2 activities. Cell Culture, Plasmids, and Transfections—Mouse NIH3T3 fibroblasts were cultured at 37 °C in F15 medium (minimum essential medium with 26 mm NaHCO3, 2 mg/liter biotin, 10 mm glucose, 4 mm glutamine, essential amino acids (50×; Invitrogen) nonessential amino acids (100×; Invitrogen), BME vitamin solution (100×; Invitrogen)) supplemented with 8% TET system-approved fetal bovine serum (Clontech). MEF p53-/- (Dr. S. Soddu (CRS-IRE, Rome)) and HF, derived from a foreskin human explant, were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium high glucose supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone). All experiments were done between passages 8 and 10. HEK cells (27Stewart N. Bacchetti S. Virology. 1991; 180: 49-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar) were cultured in α-minimum essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen) and used between passages 3 and 5. NIH3T3 cells stably transfected with MDM4, MDM2, or pTRE were maintained in medium containing 400 μg/ml G418 (23Gentiletti F. Mancini F. D'Angelo M. Sacchi A. Pontecorvi A. Jochemsen A.G. Moretti F. Oncogene. 2002; 31: 867-877Crossref Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Transient transfections were performed by the calcium phosphate precipitation technique or LipofectAMINE for full-length human MDM4 (hMDM4) and p54. Briefly, in 60-mm plates, a fixed number of cells were transfected with 8 μg of hMDM4 or p54 or pCMVβgal or pcDNA3.1 plus 0.8 μg of pEGFP plasmid (Invitrogen), as internal control of transfection efficiency. For transcriptional assays, cells were transfected with 0.5 μg of Bax-Luc (28Miyashita T. Reed J.C. Cell. 1995; 80: 293-299Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar) or 800 ng of p21-Luc plasmids plus 0.25 μg of cytomegalovirus β-galactosidase plasmid, as internal control of transfection efficiency. Cells were harvested 48 h after transfection, and Luc activity was assayed on whole cell extracts. Clonogenicity Assay—Different cell numbers (102, 2 × 102, and 5 × 102) were plated in quadruplicate in 6-cm dishes in the presence or absence of 10 μm doxycycline (Dox). Every 3 days, medium was changed, and the Dox dose was renewed. 10 days after plating, dishes were stained by crystal violet (0.25% in methanol) for 10 min and air-dried, and colonies (≥1-mm diameter) were counted. Proliferation Rate and Cell Cycle Analysis—Cell proliferation rate was assessed by determining cell number in a Thomas's hemocytometer, using trypan blue exclusion as a cell viability test. Cell proliferation under growth factor deprivation was determined by plating 105 cells in 6-cm dishes; after cell adhesion, culture medium was replaced with medium containing 0.25% fetal calf serum. After 48 h, 10 μm Dox was added. As control, the same cells were grown in the absence of Dox. Cell cycle profiles were evaluated by fixing 2 × 105 cells in cold ethanol (70%) overnight and staining DNA for 30 min at room temperature with 50 μg/ml propidium iodide in phosphate-buffered saline containing 1 mg/ml RNase A. Percentages of cells in the different phases of the cycle were measured by flow cytometric analysis of propidium iodide-stained nuclei using CELLQUEST software FACScalibur (BD Biosciences). TUNEL Assay—Cells were fixed in paraformaldehyde solution (4% in phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4) for 30 min at room temperature and permeabilized in 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.1% sodium citrate for 2 min on ice. Apoptotic nuclei were detected using a TUNEL labeling reaction according to the manufacturer's instructions (Roche Applied Science). TUNEL labeling and phase contrast images were analyzed by the AXIO VISION version 3.0 program. Immunoprecipitation and Western Blot Analysis—For immunoprecipitation experiments, cells were lysed in Giordano's buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.25 m NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100, 5 mm EDTA) containing a mixture of protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science), and whole cell extracts were centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 30 min to remove cell debris. Protein concentration was determined by a colorimetric assay (Bio-Rad). Immunoprecipitations were performed by incubating whole cell extracts with the indicated antibody, preincubated with protein G-Sepharose (Pierce), under gentle rocking at 4 °C overnight. Immunoprecipitates were washed three times with Giordano's buffer supplemented with protease inhibitors, resuspended in 40 μlof2× SDS Laemmli sample buffer, and then resolved by SDS-PAGE. For Western blot analysis, cells were lysed in radioimmune precipitation buffer (50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 1 mm EDTA) supplemented with a mixture of protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science). Whole lysates were resolved by SDS-PAGE and subsequently transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore). Before immunoblotting, membranes were stained with Ponceau Red to ensure equal protein loading. After blocking, membranes were incubated for 2 h using the following primary antibody: anti-MDM4 monoclonal antibody (6B1A, 114FD, and 12G11G), anti-p54 rat polyclonal antibody (raised against full-length p54, according to Candi et al. (29Candi E. Oddi S. Paradisi A. Terrinoni A. Ranalli M. Teofoli P. Citro G. Scarpato S. Puddu P. Melino G. J. Invest.

Schneider), anti-p21 F5 monoclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA), anti-p53 polyclonal antibody FL393 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-p53 polyclonal antibody Ab 7 (Oncogene Science), anti-Bax polyclonal antibody, N-20 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-MDM2 monoclonal antibody 2A10, anti-α-tubulin monoclonal antibody, DM1A (Sigma), and anti-Hsp70 mouse monoclonal antibody SPA-820. Membranes were developed using ECL (Amersham Biosciences). Formaldehyde Cross-linking and Immunoprecipitation of Chromatin—Cells grown as previously described were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and cross-linked as described in Boyd et al. (30Boyd K.E. Wells J. Gutman J. Bartely S.M. Farnham P.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13887-13892Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). The chromatin solution was precleared by the addition of Protein G (Pierce) for1hat4 °C and incubated with 2 μgof α-p53 (Ab 7), anti-IgG, or no antibody overnight at 4 °C with mild shaking. Before use, Protein G was blocked with 1 μg/μl sonicated salmon sperm DNA and 1 μg/μl bovine serum albumin for 2 h at 4 °C. Chromatin immunoprecipitation, washing, and elution of immune complexes were carried out as previously described (30Boyd K.E. Wells J. Gutman J. Bartely S.M. Farnham P.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13887-13892Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). DNA fragments were recovered by centrifugation and resuspended in 30 μl of double-distilled H2O and analyzed by PCR. Total input sample was resuspended in 100 μl of double-distilled H2O and then diluted 1:100 before PCR. Each reaction mixture contained 0.5–1 μl of immunoprecipitated chromatin, 70 ng of each primer, 250 μm deoxynucleoside triphosphates (Roche Applied Science), 2 mm MgCl2, 1× Taq reaction buffer, and 1.25 units of Taq polymerase (ABgene House, Epsom, UK) in a final volume of 30 μl. After 32–35 cycles of amplification, PCR products were run on a 2% agarose gel and analyzed by ethidium bromide staining. For PCR analysis of the p21 and bax promoters, the following oligonucleotides spanning the p53 binding elements (31Bouvard V. Zaitchouk T. Vacher M. Duthu A. Canivet M. Choisy-Rossi C. Nieruchalski M. May E. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 649-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar) were used: p21-up, 5′-GAG TTT GTG TGG AGG TGA CTT CTT C-3′; p21-down, 5′-CTG GTA GTT GGG TAT CAT CAG GTC T-3′; bax-up, 5′-CTG TCC TTG AAC TCA GAG AGA TGG-3′; bax-down, 5′-GGC TAT CCT GGA ACTCAC TTT TGA-3′. For PCR analysis of the tubulin gene, the following oligonucleotides were used: tub-up, 5′-GCA CTC TGA TTG TGC CTT CA-3′; tub-down, 5′-AGC AGG CAT TGG TGA TCT CT-3′. The linearity of the PCRs was verified by analyzing (i) a 10-fold dilution of the DNA samples and (ii) PCR products obtained from increasing amplification cycles. Adenovirus Generation and Infection—The strategy to create recombinant adenovirus was as previously described by He et al. (32He T.C. Zhou S. da Costa L.T. Yu J. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2509-2514Crossref PubMed Scopus (3256) Google Scholar). The BamHI fragment of cDNA coding for mouse MDM4 (nucleotides 171–1645) was cloned into the pAdShuttle-CMV (Stratagene). The resulting construct and the control construct (pAdTrack-CMV-ATCC, carrying the cDNA sequence of the green fluorescent protein gene) were linearized with PmeI and transfected by electroporation, together with pAdEasy1 vector (Stratagene) in electrocompetent E. coli BJ5183 cells (Stratagene). Recombinant colonies were selected with kanamycin and screened by restriction endonuclease digestion. The resulting recombinant adenoviral constructs were digested by PacI and transfected into the packaging cell line 293A (Invitrogen) using the LipofectAMINE Plus protocol (Invitrogen). Transfected cells were collected 10–12 days after transfection, and the viral lysates were obtained as previously described (32He T.C. Zhou S. da Costa L.T. Yu J. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2509-2514Crossref PubMed Scopus (3256) Google Scholar). To generate high titer viral stocks, the packaging cells 293A (Invitrogen) were infected, and viral titers were determined as plaque-forming units/ml by a plaque test assay as previously described (33Graham F. Prevec L. Methods Mol. Biol. 1991; 7: 109-128PubMed Google Scholar). Adenoviral infections were carried out on cell monolayers (in 60-mm Petri dishes) at the indicated multiplicities of infection by 1-h incubation at 37 °C in the presence of 1 ml of medium. Fresh culture medium was then added, and cells were subjected to the treatments as indicated in Fig. 7. Stable MDM4 Overexpression Does Not Affect p53 Levels or Change the Proliferative Capability of NIH3T3 Cells—In order to analyze the functional effects of MDM4 overexpression, we used immortalized NIH3T3 mouse fibroblasts, expressing WT p53, stably transfected with MDM4 cDNA under control of a tetracycline-inducible promoter (Tet-ON). Following 24-h treatment with 10 μm Dox, several clones were isolated and screened for MDM4 expression (NIH-MDM4), as previously reported (23Gentiletti F. Mancini F. D'Angelo M. Sacchi A. Pontecorvi A. Jochemsen A.G. Moretti F. Oncogene. 2002; 31: 867-877Crossref Scopus (35) Google Scholar). As a control, a mixed population of NIH3T3 cells stably transfected with the pTet-ON coding plasmid and the pTRE empty vector, was used (NIHpTRE) (23Gentiletti F. Mancini F. D'Angelo M. Sacchi A. Pontecorvi A. Jochemsen A.G. Moretti F. Oncogene. 2002; 31: 867-877Crossref Scopus (35) Google Scholar). First, we investigated the effects of stable MDM4 overexpression on the endogenous p53 levels. Analysis of p53 protein in NIH-MDM4 clones (MX-18 and MX-24) at different time points following Dox addition did not show changes in p53 levels during cell growth or differences in comparison with NIHpTRE cells (Fig. 1A), indicating that MDM4 overexpression does not alter p53 basal levels in NIH3T3. We had previously shown that under normal growth conditions, MDM4 inhibits p53 transcriptional activity in this system (23Gentiletti F. Mancini F. D'Angelo M. Sacchi A. Pontecorvi A. Jochemsen A.G. Moretti F. Oncogene. 2002; 31: 867-877Crossref Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Accordingly, it has been proposed that MDM4 could be a negative regulator of p53 function (7Finch R.A. Donoviel D.B.

Bradley A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 14106-14111Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), the growth of MDM4-expressing clones was compared with that of NIHpTRE control cells. In the presence of Dox, all cells had a similar proliferation rate (Fig. 1B) and fraction of viable cells (data not shown), indicating that overexpression of MDM4 does not alter these parameters. At confluence, whereas NIHpTRE cells remained viable, the NIH-MDM4 clones (MX-18 and MX-24) exhibited a reproducible reduction of viability, a phenomenon not observed in the absence of Dox (Fig. 1, compare B with C). It has also been reported that p53 inactivation correlates with increased ability of cells to survive and proliferate when plated at low densities (37Harvey M. Sands A.T. Weiss R.S. Hegi M.E. Wiseman R.W. Pantazis P. Giovanella B.G. Tainsky M.A. Bradley A. Donehower L.A. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 2457-2467PubMed Google Scholar, 38Jones S.N. Sands A.T. Hancock A.R. Vogel H. Donehower L.A.

Therefore, a colony-forming assay with different NIH-MDM4 clones was performed. Cells at different densities were plated and, every 3 days, refed with fresh medium with Dox. Surprisingly, at the lowest density (100 cells/6-cm dish), MDM4 overexpression significantly reduced colony formation in comparison with NIHpTRE control cells (Fig. 1D). All of these data show that MDM4 overexpression per se does not alter the growth properties of NIH3T3 cells or affect endogenous p53 protein basal levels and rather suggest that it might increase cell susceptibility to stress conditions. MDM4 Overexpression Stabilizes Transcriptionally Active p53—To ascertain whether MDM4 does indeed affect cell viability under stress conditions, we analyzed the cell response following treatment with Adriamycin (Adr), a DNA damage-inducing drug that activates the tumor suppressor p53 (39Kastan M.B. Onyekwere O. Sindransky D. Vogelstein B. Craig R.W. Cancer Res. 1991; 51: 6304-6311PubMed Google Scholar) and arrests NIH3T3 cells in the G1/G2 phase of cell cycle (23Gentiletti F. Mancini F. D'Angelo M. Sacchi A. Pontecorvi A. Jochemsen A.G. Moretti F. Oncogene. 2002; 31: 867-877Crossref Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Since enhancement of p53 levels is a common finding following Adr stimulus (39Kastan M.B. Onyekwere O. Sindransky D. Vogelstein B. Craig R.W. Cancer Res. 1991; 51: 6304-6311PubMed Google Scholar), we first tested the effects of MDM4 overexpression on p53 levels. Adr (0.9 μm) was added 16 h after induction of MDM4 by Dox, and p53 protein levels were evaluated. Indeed, Adr treatment increased p53 levels in both NIHpTRE and MX-18 cells (Fig. 2A), but more substantially and for a longer period of time in the latter, indicating that MDM4 overexpression enhances p53 levels under these conditions. We then tested whether the induced p53 protein retained transcription activating competence. We performed transient transfection assays using the p53-responsive promoters of the bax and p21 genes. MDM4 expression was induced 8 h before transfection, cells were then transfected and treated with adriamycin for 24 h before lysis. In all NIH-MDM4 clones, the addition of doxycycline caused a reproducible increase of p21 and more strongly of bax promoter activity (Fig. 2B), whereas in NIHpTRE control cells, it did not cause further induction of either promoter.

https://openalex.org/W2106176387,"Integrin alpha(1)beta(1) is one of four collagen-binding integrins in humans. Collagens bind to the alphaI domain and in the case of alpha(2)I collagen binding is competitively inhibited by peptides containing the sequence and derived from the metalloproteinase jararhagin of snake venom from Bothrops jararaca. In alpha(2)I, these peptides bind near the metal ion-dependent adhesion site (MIDAS), where a collagen (I)-like peptide is known to bind; magnesium is required for binding. Published structures of the ligand-bound open conformation of alpha(2)I differs significantly from the closed conformation seen in the structure of apo-alpha(2)I near MIDAS. Here we show that two peptides, CTRKKHDC and CARKKHDC, derived from jararhagin also bind to alpha(1)I and competitively inhibit collagen I binding. Furthermore, calorimetric and fluorimetric measurements show that the structure of the complex of alpha(1)I with Mg(2+) and CTRKKHDC differs from structure in the absence of peptide. A comparison of the x-ray structure of apo-alpha(1)I (closed conformation) and a model structure of the alpha(1)I (open conformation) based on the closely related structure of alpha(2)I reveals that the binding site is partially blocked to ligands by Glu(255) and Tyr(285) in the closed structure, whereas in the open structure helix C is unwound and these residues are shifted, and the RKKH peptides fit well when docked. The open conformation of alpha(2)I resulting from binding a collagen (I)-like peptide leads to exposure of hydrophobic surface, also seen in the model of alpha(1)I and shown experimentally for alpha(1)I using a fluorescent hydrophobic probe."
https://openalex.org/W2107752085,"Glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored proteins are synthesized as precursor proteins that are processed in the endoplasmic reticulum by GPI transamidase (GPIT). Human GPIT is a multisubunit membrane-bound protein complex consisting of Gaa1, Gpi8, phosphatidylinositol glycan (PIG)-S, PIG-T, and PIG-U. The enzyme recognizes a C-terminal signal sequence in the proprotein and replaces it with a preformed GPI lipid. The nature of the functional interaction of the GPIT subunits with each other and with the proprotein and GPI substrates is largely unknown. We recently analyzed the GPIT subunit Gaa1, a polytopic protein with seven transmembrane (TM) spans, to identify sequence determinants in the protein that are required for its interaction with other subunits and for function (Vainauskas, S., Maeda, Y., Kurniawan, H., Kinoshita, T., and Menon, A. K. (2002) J. Biol. Chem. 277, 30535–30542). We showed that elimination of the C-terminal TM segment of Gaa1 allows the protein to interact with Gpi8, PIG-S, and PIG-T but renders the resulting GPIT complex nonfunctional. We now show that GPIT complexes containing C-terminally truncated Gaa1 possess a full complement of subunits and are able to interact with a proprotein substrate but cannot co-immunoprecipitate GPI. We go on to show that mutation of a conserved proline residue centrally located within the C-terminal TM span of Gaa1 is sufficient to abrogate the ability of the resulting GPIT complex to co-immunoprecipitate GPI. We suggest that the putative dynamic hinge created by the proline residue provides a structural basis for the interaction of GPI with GPIT.

Mammalian GPIT consists of at least five components: Gaa1, Gpi8, PIG-S, PIG-T, and PIG-U (4Yu J. Nagarajan S. Knez J.J. Udenfriend S. Chen R. Medof M.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Gpi8 is the likely enzymatic component of the GPIT complex, since it shares sequence homology with a family of plant vacuolar endopeptidases and possesses a critical sulfhydryl residue that is probably involved in catalysis (3Benghezal M. Benachour A. Rusconi S. Aebi M. Conzelman A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6575-6583Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 6Ohishi K. Inoue N. Maeda Y. Takeda J. Riezman H. Kinoshita T. Mol. Biol.

Furthermore, chemical and site-specific photocross-linking studies show that Gpi8 can be cross-linked to proproteins, indicating that it is in physical proximity to at least one of the substrates of GPIT (16Vidugiriene J. Vainauskas S. Johnson A.E. Menon A.K. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 2290-2300Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 17Spurway T.D. Dalley J.A. High S. Bulleid N.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 15975-15982Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). PIG-U contains a sequence motif found in yeast and mammalian fatty acid elongases. This motif is important for PIG-U function, and it has been suggested to play a role in recognizing long chain fatty acids in GPI (9Hong Y. Ohishi K. Kang J.Y. Tanaka S. Inoue N. Nishimura J. Maeda Y. Kinoshita T. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 1780-1789Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Unlike Gpi8 and PIG-U, the other subunits (Gaa1, PIG-S, and PIG-T) share essentially no homology with any proteins of known function, and their functional role in GPIT action is unclear. As part of our overall objective to determine the physical and functional architecture of GPIT and to understand the role of the various subunits in GPIT action, we recently identified sequence determinants in Gaa1 that are required for its interaction with other GPIT subunits and for function (18Vainauskas S. Maeda Y. Kurniawan H. Kinoshita T. Menon A.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 30535-30542Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Gaa1 is a polytopic membrane protein with seven transmembrane (TM) spans and a large, N-glycosylated luminal loop between the first two TM spans (Fig. 1). The luminal loop is required for Gaa1 to interact with Gpi8, PIG-S, and PIG-T. However, the entire protein appears to be required for function, since removal of the last TM segment yields GPIT complexes that are nonfunctional (18Vainauskas S. Maeda Y. Kurniawan H. Kinoshita T. Menon A.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 30535-30542Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). In this study, we analyzed why deletion of the last TM segment of Gaa1 renders the protein nonfunctional. We considered three possibilities: (i) Gaa1 is involved in binding PIG-U (this was not tested in our previous work, since PIG-U was discovered only subsequently); (ii) Gaa1 participates in recognition of the proprotein; and (iii) Gaa1 is needed for recognition/presentation of GPI. We speculated that removal of the last TM segment of Gaa1 could conceivably affect any or all of these possible interactions with other subunits or GPIT substrates. To investigate these possibilities, we prepared different epitope-tagged variants of Gaa1 (Fig. 1) and tested the ability of these constructs to interact with PIG-U, proprotein, and GPI substrates. We used transient transfection to introduce the proteins into HeLa cells and immunoprecipitation to probe interactions with other components. Our results show that deletion of the last TM segment of Gaa1 does not affect recruitment of PIG-U or proprotein to the GPIT complex but abrogates GPI binding. Further analyses indicate that a putative hinge created by a proline residue centrally located within the last TM segment may provide a structural basis for the interaction of GPIT with GPI. These results provide the first experimental data on how GPIs are associated with the GPIT protein complex. Antibodies—Mouse monoclonal antibodies against the FLAG peptide epitope and HA epitope were purchased from Sigma. Rat monoclonal antibodies against mouse Thy-1 (clone G7) were obtained from BD Biosciences Pharmingen. Mouse monoclonal antibody against the V5 peptide epitope was obtained from Invitrogen. Rabbit polyclonal anti-V5 antibodies were kindly provided by Dr. Karen Colley (University of Illinois at Chicago). Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit and anti-mouse IgG were from Promega (Madison, WI). Construction of Mammalian Expression Vectors—N-terminally FLAG-tagged human Gaa1 constructs D1, D2, D4, and D5 were generated as described previously (18Vainauskas S. Maeda Y. Kurniawan H.

The Gaa1 D1 P609L and W611L mutants were generated using PCR-mediated megaprimer mutagenesis. GPI-HA cDNA, coding the ectodomain of influenza hemagglutinin (HA) fused to the C-terminal GPI attachment signal sequence of decay-accelerating factor protein (a gift from Dr. Judith White, University of Virginia Health System), was PCR-amplified using sense HA-GPI5 (5′-cggcggatccgccatggagaccatcattgctttgagc-3′) and antisense HA-GPI3 (5′-cggctctagactaagtcagcaagcccatggt-3′) from the plasmid pTM1/GPI-HA. The PCR-amplified product was digested with BamHI/XbaI and ligated into BamHI/XbaI-digested mammalian expression vector pEF6 (Invitrogen). The resulting plasmid was named pEF/HA-GPI. Human PIG-U cDNA was obtained by PCR amplification from HeLa First Strand cDNA (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) with a sense primer PU5 (5′-cgggatccgccatggcggctcccttggtcctg-3′) and an antisense primer 3U2 (5′-cacgagcatggcctctgtgccatc-3′). The PCR-amplified product was ligated into mammalian expression vector pEF6/V5-His-TOPO (Invitrogen). The resulting pEF/PIG-U-V5 construct encodes PIG-U with C-terminal V5 and His6 epitope tags. All constructs were verified by sequencing of the plasmids. Cell Culture and Transfection—HeLa cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum. The cells were maintained in a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere at 37 °C and transfected by electroporation as described previously (18Vainauskas S. Maeda Y. Kurniawan H. Kinoshita T. Menon A.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 30535-30542Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitations and Immunoblots—Transfected HeLa cells (1–2 × 107 cells) were scraped off the culture dish 48 h post-transfection, washed once with PBS, resuspended in 1 ml of MSB buffer (20 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.6, 200 mm NaCl, 1% (w/v) digitonin or Nonidet P-40, and 1× protease inhibitor mixture (Calbiochem)) and incubated on ice for 60 min. The cell lysate was clarified by medium speed centrifugation (20 min, 10,000 × g, 4 °C), and the resulting supernatant was ultra-centrifuged (45 min, 100,000 × g, 4 °C) to generate a clear detergent extract. Extracts were treated with 30 μl of anti-FLAG M2 or anti-V5 agarose slurry (both from Sigma) at 4 °C for 4 h with gentle agitation. The beads were pelleted by centrifugation for 15 s at 10,000 × g, and washed four times for 5 min each in 1.5 ml of MSB buffer. Bound antigen was released from the beads by incubating with FLAG or V5 peptide (200 μg/ml) in MSB buffer. Immunoprecipitated fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE, followed by immunoblotting using chemiluminescence reagents (Pierce). [3H]Mannose Labeling: GPI Extraction and Analysis—HeLa cells were transiently transfected with different FLAG-Gaa1 constructs or FLAG-PIG-A. Two days later, the transfected cells (∼1 × 107) were preincubated for 1 h at 37 °C in 10 ml of glucose-free RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 5 μg/ml tunicamycin and 10% (v/v) dialyzed fetal bovine serum. The medium was then replaced with 3 ml of fresh glucose-free RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% (v/v) dialyzed fetal bovine serum and 50–70 μCi/ml d-[2-3H]mannose (American Radiolabeled Chemicals, Inc.), and the cells were incubated for 2 h at 37 °C. After labeling, the cells were washed twice with PBS, scraped off the culture dish, resuspended in 1 ml of MSB buffer with 1% (w/v) digitonin, and solubilized on ice for 60 min. The cell lysate was clarified by centrifugation and subjected to immunoprecipitation using anti-FLAG M2-agarose beads as described under “Immunoprecipitation and Immunoblots.” The bead-bound immunoprecipitates were washed three times in 1 ml of MSB buffer and then aliquoted for immunoblotting and GPI extraction. The postimmunoprecipitation supernatant was also subjected to GPI extraction. The samples were treated with chloroform/methanol/water (10:10:3 by volume) to extract polar GPIs as described previously (19Vidugiriene J. Menon A.K. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 250: 513-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Chloroform/methanol/water extracts were dried, and labeled lipids were desalted by partitioning between n-butyl alcohol-saturated water and water-saturated n-butyl alcohol. The n-butyl alcohol phases were chromatographed on glass-backed silica gel 60 TLC plates (Merck) using chloroform/methanol/water (10:10:3 by volume) as the developing solvent. The chromatograms were visualized by scanning using a TLC scanner (Berthold LB2842 Automatic TLC Linear Analyzer). Radiolabeled GPIs were identified by their sensitivity to GPI-specific phospholipase D and by co-migration with previously characterized GPIs. Endoglycosidase H (Endo H) and Peptide:N-Glycosidase F (PNGase F) Treatment—Endo H and PNGase F (New England Biolabs) were used for digestion of protein N-linked glycans. Protein samples were denatured by adding 0.1 volume of 10× denaturation buffer (5% SDS, 10% β-mercaptoethanol), followed by incubation for 5 min at 100 °C. Then, 0.1 volume of 10× Endo H reaction buffer (0.5 m sodium citrate, pH 5.5, at 25 °C) or 10× PNGase F reaction buffer (0.5 m sodium phosphate, pH 7.5, at 25 °C, 10% Nonidet P-40) was added to the denatured sample, followed by incubation with 0.5 μl of 500 units/μl Endo H or PNGase F for1hat37 °C. Glycosidase-treated samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. Flow Cytometry—Mouse GAA1-knockout F9 cells were a generous gift from Dr. Taroh Kinoshita (Osaka University). The cells (1 × 107) were suspended in 400 μl of culture medium (high glucose Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum) and electroporated with 25 μg each of plasmids at 500 microfarads and 250 V using Gene Pulser Xcell (Bio-Rad). Two days after electroporation, an aliquot of the sample was taken for immunoblotting analysis of the expressed proteins as described under “Immunoprecipitation and Immunoblots,” whereas the remaining cells were stained with rat anti-Thy-1 antibody followed by fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-rat IgG and analyzed by FACScan (Becton Dickinson). Phosphatidylinositol-specific Phospholipase C (PI-PLC) Treatment— HeLa cells were transiently transfected with HA-GPI cDNA. Two days post-transfection, cells (∼1 × 107) were washed twice with PBS and incubated in 1 ml of PBS with Staphylococcus aureus PI-PLC (a gift from Vicky Stevens, Emory University) for 30 min at 37 °C. After treatment, the incubation buffer was collected, and the cells were scraped off the culture dish, resuspended in 1 ml of MSB buffer with 1% (w/v) Nonidet P-40, and solubilized on ice for 60 min. Both the incubation buffer and the cell lysate were clarified by centrifugation and subjected to immunoblotting analysis as described under “Immunoprecipitation and Immunoblots.” The constructs used in this paper are illustrated schematically in Fig. 1. PIG-U Is Present in GPIT Complexes Containing C-terminally Truncated Gaa1—Previous analyses of a series of C-terminal truncation variants of Gaa1 led us to the conclusion that the large luminal loop between the first and second TM spans of Gaa1 is responsible for bringing Gaa1 into a complex with Gpi8, PIG-S, and PIG-T, whereas the last TM segment is necessary for generating a functional GPIT complex (18Vainauskas S. Maeda Y. Kurniawan H. Kinoshita T. Menon A.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 30535-30542Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). We specifically showed that the D2 construct that lacks the last TM segment of Gaa1 formed a nonfunctional, ER-localized GPIT complex with Gpi8, PIG-S, and PIG-T. We speculated that the last TM segment of Gaa1 is required for substrate binding or possibly for mediating the interaction of Gaa1 with yet other, hitherto unidentified, subunits of the GPIT complex. Kinoshita and colleagues (9Hong Y. Ohishi K. Kang J.Y. Tanaka S. Inoue N. Nishimura J. Maeda Y. Kinoshita T. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 1780-1789Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) recently identified PIG-U, a highly hydrophobic, polytopic membrane protein, as a fifth subunit of GPIT. We considered the possibility that the last TM segment of Gaa1 is involved in recruiting PIG-U to GPIT complexes and that D2-containing GPIT complexes are nonfunctional because they lack PIG-U. To test this idea, we co-transfected HeLa cells with cDNAs corresponding to PIG-U-V5 and either D1, D2, or FLAG-PIG-A (an irrelevant FLAG-tagged membrane protein). Two days after transfection, the cells were lysed and treated with immobilized anti-V5 antibodies to immunoprecipitate PIG-U-V5 and any associated proteins. The immunoprecipitated (IP) samples and post-IP supernatants (material not bound to the anti-V5 beads) were analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-V5 antibodies (to reveal PIG-U) and anti-FLAG antibodies (to reveal D1, D2, or PIG-A). Both D1 and D2 were co-immunoprecipitated with PIG-U (Fig. 2, lower panel, lanes 1 and 3), whereas FLAG-PIG-A was not (Fig. 2, lower panel, lane 5). The significant amount of D1 and D2 remaining in the post-IP supernatant (Fig. 2, lower panel, lanes 2 and 4), despite quantitative immunoprecipitation of PIGU-V5 (Fig. 2, upper panel), is a result of protein overexpression and a presumed shortage of the endogenously expressed Gpi8, PIG-S, and PIG-T subunits. These results, together with our previous data, indicate that D2-containing GPIT complexes possess a full complement of known transamidase subunits and that the nonfunctionality of these complexes is probably due to defects in substrate recognition or catalysis. The ability of the full-length and truncated Gaa1 variants to co-precipitate PIG-U was significantly reduced when lysates were prepared in the presence of 1% Nonidet P-40, compared with 1% digitonin (data not shown). Since Nonidet P-40 had no effect on the co-precipitation of the other GPIT components with Gaa1, it is possible that Gaa1, Gpi8, PIG-S, and PIG-T form a tightly associated core with which PIG-U is only weakly associated. GPIT Complexes Containing C-terminally Truncated Gaa1 Are Able to Interact with a Proprotein Substrate of the Enzyme—We next set out to test whether D2-containing GPIT complexes are able to interact with proproteins destined for GPI anchor attachment. Instead of relying on endogenously expressed proprotein precursors of GPI-anchored proteins, we used HA-GPI for our experiments. HA-GPI is a modified form of influenza hemagglutinin that contains the GPI attachment signal sequence of decay-accelerating factor fused to its C terminus (20Kemble G.W. Danieli T. White J.M. Cell. 1994; 76: 383-391Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar). When expressed in HeLa cells, HA-GPI is expressed at the cell surface as a GPI-anchored protein. We demonstrated this by showing that treatment of HA-GPI-expressing cells with phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C results in the release of a large fraction of HA-GPI into the extracellular medium, whereas mock treatment has no effect (Fig. 3A). The HA released into the medium has a higher apparent molecular weight than the HA associated with the cells, in part because the released material corresponds predominantly to Golgi-processed HA with complex N-glycans (see below) and also because of the aberrant mobility shift that accompanies removal of the hydrophobic portion of the GPI anchor. Incomplete release of HA upon PI-PLC treatment is probably due to the presence of intracellular pools of the protein en route to the cell surface as well as to the frequently noted inefficiency of PI-PLC-mediated release of cell surface GPI-anchored proteins. HeLa cells were co-transfected with cDNAs corresponding to HA-GPI and PIG-U-V5, together with cDNAs corresponding to the FLAG-tagged Gaa1 variants D1, D2, or D4. Digitonin extracts of the transfected cells were subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-FLAG beads, and the IP fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. Fig. 3B shows that immunoprecipitates of D1, D2, and D4 contain both GPI-HA and PIG-U, whereas the control FLAG-PIG-A immunoprecipitate does not. These results suggest that despite the truncation of one or three C-terminal TM segments (constructs D2 and D4, respectively), Gaa1 is able to assemble into PIG-U-containing GPIT complexes that are capable of interacting with a proprotein substrate. Similar results (data not shown) were obtained with D5, a Gaa1 construct truncated after the first three TM spans (Fig. 1). Co-immunoprecipitation of HA-GPI with epitope-tagged Gaa1-containing GPIT complexes was significantly less efficient in lysates prepared using Nonidet P-40 rather than digitonin. The detergent sensitivity of the association suggests that the HA-GPI·GPIT complex is noncovalent and that it does not represent the enzyme-substrate complex predicted to be an intermediate in the transamidase reaction. The HA-GPI molecules that co-precipitate with GPIT in our analyses could be either proproteins with an intact GPI signal sequence or GPI-anchored proteins that have yet to exit the ER (see below). Although this is a point that remains to be explored in future work, it does not affect the conclusions presented here. We henceforth refer to GPIT-associated HA-GPI as a proprotein. The association of substrate protein with GPIT has been reported previously (10Ohishi K. Nagamune K. Maeda Y. Kinoshita T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 13959-13967Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 16Vidugiriene J. Vainauskas S. Johnson A.E. Menon A.K. Eur. J.

Biochem. 2003; 88: 1025-1037Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) in studies utilizing an in vitro translation system and model proproteins with altered C-terminal GPI attachment signal sequences, or utilizing inactive GPIT complexes for co-precipitation of proprotein substrate. Our results indicate that the interaction between GPIT and the proprotein is experimentally detectable even without recourse to mutant GPIT complexes or modified proproteins. Fig. 3B shows that HA-GPI recovered in the post-IP supernatant migrates more slowly than HA-GPI that is immunoprecipitated with D1, D2, or D4. This suggests that HA-GPI in the IP fraction has N-glycans characteristic of the ER, whereas HA-GPI in the post-IP supernatants possesses higher molecular mass, Golgi-modified N-glycans. To verify this, we prepared cell lysates and anti-FLAG immunoprecipitates from HeLa cells co-transfected with cDNAs corresponding to D1 and HAGPI and analyzed the samples by glycosidase treatment, SDS-PAGE, and immunoblotting. When the crude lysate was treated with Endo H or PNGase F, both Endo H-sensitive and -resistant forms of HA-GPI were observed (Fig. 3C). However, only the Endo H-sensitive form of HA-GPI was found co-immunoprecipitated with D1, indicating a specific interaction of the ER-localized HA-GPI protein precursor with GPIT. D2-containing GPIT Complexes Do Not Interact with GPI— Since D2-containing GPIT complexes comprise all five known transamidase subunits and retain the ability to interact with the proprotein substrate of the enzyme, we considered the possibility that the nonfunctionality of these complexes is due to their inability to interact with GPI. To test this, we transfected HeLa cells with D1, D2, or FLAG-PIG-A (control) and metabolically labeled the cells with [2-3H]mannose to generate radiolabeled GPI lipids in situ. Digitonin extracts of the cells were incubated with anti-FLAG beads, and the IP material and post-IP supernatants were extracted with chloroform/methanol/water (10:10:3 by volume). The organic extracts were dried, partitioned between n-butyl alcohol and water, and the n-butyl alcohol phases were analyzed by TLC (Fig. 4). The TLC profile of radiolabeled lipids (visualized using a radioactivity scanner) in the post-IP supernatants from all transfectants displayed strong peaks corresponding to the phosphoethanolamine-containing GPI H8 (Fig. 1) and its lysoderivative as well as a collection of fast migrating peaks that have been previously noted and remain to be characterized. The extent of radioactivity recovered in the lipid extract of all three post-IP supernatants was comparable. However, only the D1 IP sample contained H8, whereas IP material from D2 and FLAG-PIG-A did not contain detectable amounts of the lipid (Fig. 4). All three constructs were similarly expressed and recovered in the IP (Fig. 4, immunoblot), indicating that the variation in GPI recovery was not due to expression level. H8 was not recovered in the D1 IP when cells were extracted with Nonidet P-40 rather than digitonin, indicating that the interaction between GPI and GPIT is relatively weak. Furthermore, lyso-H8 was not recovered to the same extent as H8, suggestive of a weaker binding interaction. We confirmed that the interaction we observed was between H8- and D1-containing GPIT complexes rather than between H8- and “free” overexpressed D1 by demonstrating that H8 could be co-precipitated with FLAG-Gpi8 (Fig. 5), PIG-T-V5, and PIG-U-V5 (data for the latter constructs are not shown). The cumulative data show that H8 can be recovered in association with functional GPIT complexes in digitonin extracts of cells but not with D2-containing GPIT complexes under the same conditions. These results offer an explanation for the nonfunctionality of D2 and point to a role for the last TM segment of Gaa1 in GPI recognition by GPIT. A Proline Residue in the Center of the Last TM Segment of Gaa1 Is Required for GPI Recognition by GPIT—The nonfunctional D2 mutant lacks the last 56 amino acids of Gaa1 that form part of the connecting loop between last two TM domains, the last TM segment itself, and a short luminally exposed C terminus (Fig. 1). ClustalW multiple sequence alignment (22Combet C. Blanchet C. Geourjon C. Deléage G. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 147-150Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1458) Google Scholar) of the Gaa1 orthologs revealed no significant homology in the loop region and limited, although important, homology in the last TM segment. As seen in Fig. 6, two highly conserved residues (proline and tryptophan) are located near the center of the last TM segment. The conserved proline residue is of particular interest. Although proline occurs frequently at either end of TM α-helices, there is a significant occurrence of this “helix-breaking” residue within the transbilayer region (23Cordes F.S. Bright J.N. Sansom M.S.P. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 323: 951-960Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar, 24Reiersen H. Rees A.R. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 679-684Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Prolines within a GXXPorGXP motif located in the middle of a TM α-helix have been shown, via structural analyses and molecular dynamics simulations, to behave as a molecular hinge capable of dynamically kinking and swiveling the helix (23Cordes F.S. Bright J.N. Sansom M.S.P. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 323: 951-960Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar, 25Tieleman D.P. Shrivastava I.H. Ulmschneider M.R. Sansom M.S.P. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 2001; 44: 63-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Fig. 6 shows that the last TM span of mammalian (mouse, rat, and human), Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Candida albicans, and Caenorhabditis elegans Gaa1 contains a GX(X)P motif. To investigate whether the conserved proline and tryptophan residues (Pro609 and Trp611 in human Gaa1) are important for recognition of GPI, we replaced them individually with leucine. We confirmed that both the P609L and the W611L mutants of D1 were incorporated into GPIT complexes by demonstrating that they could be co-precipitated with the other GPIT subunits (not shown). To determine whether these mutations affected the ability of GPIT complexes to bind H8, HeLa cells were separately transfected with cDNAs corresponding to P609L and W611L, metabolically labeled with [2-3H]mannose 2 days post-transfection, lysed in digitonin, and treated with anti-FLAG beads to immunoprecipitate GPIT complexes containing the mutant proteins. The IP material and post-IP supernatants were subjected to lipid extraction followed by TLC analysis. Fig. 7A shows that despite similar levels of protein expression and GPI radiolabeling, P609L-containing GPIT complexes did not bind H8 under our IP conditions, whereas W611L-containing complexes did. However, P609L-containing GPIT complexes could co-immunoprecipitate HA-GPI, indicating that the defect specifically concerned recognition of the GPI substrate (Fig. 7B). To assay the functional capability of the mutants, we separately transfected mouse GAA1 knockout F9 cells with cDNAs corresponding to D1, P609L, and W611L. F9 cells are unable to express cell surface GPI-anchored Thy-1, and we hypothesized that expression of D1 or W611L in the cells would rescue cell surface Thy-1 expression, whereas expression of P609L would not. Transfection of F9 cells with D1 or W611L cDNA rescued Thy-1 expression as seen by fluorescence-activated cell sorting, whereas transfection with P609L cDNA or a vector control did not (data not shown). However, immunoblotting of the same samples showed that whereas D1 and D1 W611L were expressed well, expression of P609L was very poor (data not shown). For reasons that are unclear, the expression level of P609L in F9 cells in several independent attempts was more than 10-fold lower than that of either D1 or W611L, despite all three proteins being comparably expressed in HeLa cells. Thus, whereas we can conclude that both D1 and W611L are functional, the experiments with P609L in F9 cells were uninformative. Conclusion—The results described in this paper point to a critical role for the Gaa1 subunit in GPI recognition by GPIT. Elimination of the last TM segment of Gaa1 or mutation of a centrally located, conserved proline residue within the last TM segment of Gaa1 abrogates the ability of GPIT to co-immunoprecipitate GPI without affecting the ability of the enzyme to bind its other substrate, the proprotein. The functional importance of the proline residue may be due to its ability to kink and swivel the predicted α-helical structure of the last TM span, forming a dynamic hinge. Proline-induced hinges have been postulated to play a role in the insertion of antimicrobial peptides into membranes and in the gating of ion channels (24Reiersen H. Rees A.R. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 679-684Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 25Tieleman D.P. Shrivastava I.H. Ulmschneider M.R. Sansom M.S.P. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 2001; 44: 63-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 26Brandl C.J. Deber C.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 917-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). In the case of GPIT, we suggest that a proline hinge in Gaa1 could provide a flexible structural accommodation for the GPI moiety, possibly in concert with PIG-U, a protein that has been proposed to be involved in recognizing long fatty acyl chains of GPIs by virtue of its functionally critical fatty acid elongase sequence motif. The precise role of Gaa1 and/or PIG-U in GPI binding remains to be determined. These subunits may function to present GPI to Gpi8, influence GPI binding to Gpi8, or contribute a GPI-binding activator site that communicates allosterically with another GPI binding site in Gpi8. Udenfriend and colleagues (27Kodukula K. Amthauer R. Cines D. Yeh E.T.H. Brink L. Thomas L.J. Udenfriend S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 4982-4985Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) have shown that GPI is an obligatory co-substrate for GPIT even when another nucleophile is present to attack the activated carbonyl intermediate formed in the first step of the transamidase reaction. These results support the possibility that Gaa1 and/or PIG-U may represent a regulatory binding site for GPI within GPIT. Evidence of two lipid binding sites has been recently presented for oligosaccharyltransferase, a multisubunit, membrane-bound ER enzyme that, like GPIT, handles both protein and lipid substrates (28Karaoglu D. Kelleher D.J. Gilmore R. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 12193-12206Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). More work needs to be done to investigate these possibilities.

https://openalex.org/W2022664595,"By using transient elevations of cytosolic free calcium levels triggered by integrin antibody or laminin (Kwon, M. S., Park, C.

Cell 11, 1433-1443), we have demonstrated that protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) is implicated in the regulation of reversible phosphorylation of integrin. In E63 skeletal myoblasts, the treatment of PP2A inhibitors such as okadaic acid and endothall induces an increase of phosphorylation of integrin β1A and thereby inhibits integrin-induced elevation of cytosolic calcium level and formation of focal adhesions. None of these effects were in differentiated myotubes expressing the alternate β1D isoform. In the presence of okadaic acid, PP2A in association with integrin β1A was reduced on myoblasts, whereas β1D on myotubes remained bound with PP2A. Both co-immunoprecipitation and in vitro phosphatase assays revealed that dephosphorylation of residues Thr788-Thr789 in the integrin β1A cytoplasmic domain is dependent upon PP2A activity. Mutational analysis of the cytoplasmic domain and confocal microscopy experiments indicated that substitution of Thr788-Thr789 with Asn788—Asn789 is of critical importance for regulating the function of integrin β1. These results suggest that PP2A may be a primary regulator of threonine phosphorylation of integrin β1A and subsequent activation of downstream signaling molecules. Taken together, we propose that dephosphorylation of residues Thr788-Thr789 in the cytoplasmic domain of integrin β1A may contribute to the linkage of integrins to focal adhesion sites and induce the association with cytoskeleton proteins. The switch of integrin β1A to β1D isoform in myotubes therefore may be a mechanism to escape from phospho-regulation by PP2A and promotes a more stable association of the cytoskeleton with the extracellular matrix.

The specificity of ligand binding by integrins is conferred by the particular combination of the cytoplasmic domains of α and β subunits (2Hynes R.O. Cell. 1992; 69: 11-25Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (8963) Google Scholar). The sequences of the cytoplasmic domains of α and β subunits are quite divergent from one another. Alternative forms of cytoplasmic domains that arise from alternate splicing have been found in the integrin β1, β3, β4, α3, α6, and α7 cytoplasmic domains (3Albelda S.M. Buck C.A.

Presumably, these diversities within the cytoplasmic domains modulate the capacity of integrins to mediate the transduction of ECM-mediated signals as well as signals arising within the cell that are directed outward via activation of integrins (2Hynes R.O.

The cytoplasmic domains of the integrin β1, in particular, have been demonstrated to play central roles in many aspects of integrin function such as cell adhesion, cell migration, control of cell differentiation, proliferation, and programmed cell death. In recent studies (10Green L.J. Mould P. Humphries M.J. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1998; 30: 179-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 11Lewis J.M. Schwartz M.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 151-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar), more cellular proteins have been reported to directly or indirectly interact with the cytoplasmic domain of integrin β1. Cytoskeletal proteins such as α-actinin, F-actin, skelemin, talin, vinculin, filamin, and tensin are known to bind the integrin β1 cytoplasmic domain (12Pfaff M. Liu S. Erle D.J. Ginsberg M.H. J.

Phosphorylated integrin β1 in src-transformed fibroblasts does not localize to focal contacts (16Sakai T. Jove R. Fassler R. Mosher D.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 3808-3813Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Increased phosphorylation of integrin β3 on Thr residues by addition of calyculin A decreased platelet adhesion and spreading on fibrinogen (34Lerea K.M. Cordero K.P. Sakariassen K.S. Kirk R.I. Fried V.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1914-1919Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Mutational analysis of amino acid residues of the β1 cytoplasmic domain has shown that integrin activity is functionally related to the potential phosphorylation sites of the β1 cytoplasmic domain. One of the potential sites is composed of two NPXY motifs in the cytoplasmic domains of integrin β1A, β1D, β2, β3, β5, β6, and β7 (35O'Toole T.E. Ylanne J. Culley B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8553-8558Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 36Filardo E.J. Brooks P.C. Deming S.L. Damsky C. Cheresh D.A. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 441-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Upon phosphorylation of the NPXY motifs by tyrosine kinase(s), the integrin loses its affinity for both extracellular ligand and cytoplasmic components of the focal contacts and exits to focal contact. Mutagenesis of Asn or Pro residues of the NPXY motifs causes the loss of β subunits from focal contacts. Tyr783 mutation of the NPXY motif of the β1 cytoplasmic domain completely inhibits binding of PAC1 that recognizes integrins in the activated state (37Barreuther M.F. Grabel L.B. Exp. Cell Res. 1996; 222: 10-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar).In particular, S785D, Y783A, and Y795A resulted in an inability to localize to focal adhesion sites (38Rezka A.A. Hayashi Y. Horwitz A. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 117: 1321-1330Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). Conversion of the unphosphorylated and phosphorylated state of integrins takes place during cell differentiation. Undifferentiated F9 cells are phosphorylated on the serine residue of the cytoplasmic domain of the β1 chain and dephosphorylated during differentiation (37Barreuther M.F. Grabel L.B. Exp. Cell Res. 1996; 222: 10-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). During muscle cell differentiation, the integrin β1 undergoes isoform switch from β1A to β1D (39Belkin A.M. Zhidkova N.I. Balzac F. Altruda F. Tomatis D. Maier A. Tarone G. Koteliansky V.E. Burridge K. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 211-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 40Belkin A.M. Retta S.F. Pletjushkina O.Y. Silengo L. Fassler R. Koteliansky V.E. Burridge K. Tarone G. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 1583-1595Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the Thr788-Thr789 residues, potential phosphorylation sites in the integrin β1A cytoplasmic domain, are substituted with Asn788-Asn789 in the β1D splice variant.Although a number of studies have suggested that phosphorylation of β1 integrin cytoplasmic domains alters their functions, there are still numerous conflicting reports regarding the modulation of integrin function. Moreover, relatively little is known about the potential role of Thr phosphorylation (788-789) of the integrin β1 cytoplasmic domain and the coordinated activity of protein kinases and phosphatases that regulate threonine phosphorylation in modulating the function of the integrin β1 cytoplasmic domain.Recently, it was shown that binding of integrin antibodies or laminin (LN) to integrin induces extracellular Ca2+ influx through L-type Ca2+ channels (1Kwon M.S. Park C.S. Choi K. Park C.-S. Ahnn J. Kim J.I. Eom S.H. Kaufman S.J. Song W.K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 1433-1443Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) and increases the cytosolic free calcium concentration ([Ca2+]i), which can be used as an indicator of integrin activation (1Kwon M.S. Park C.S. Choi K. Park C.-S. Ahnn J. Kim J.I. Eom S.H. Kaufman S.J. Song W.K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 1433-1443Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 41Richardson A. Parsons J.T. BioEssays. 1995; 17: 229-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). In this study, we showed that treatment with PP2A inhibitors such as okadaic acid and endothall inhibits the elevation of [Ca2+]i and the formation of focal adhesion complex in E63 myoblasts. Also, we demonstrated that PP2A in association with integrin β1 mediates dephosphorylation of residues Thr788-Thr789 on integrin β1A and thereby induces an increase of integrin association with cytoskeleton. In particular, the isoform switch of β1A to βD may be a mechanism to escape from phosphoregulation by PP2A during skeletal muscle differentiation. The dephosphorylated β1D is likely to provide high tensile strength in association with cytoskeletal proteins for muscle function.MATERIALS AND METHODSAntibodies and Reagents—Rabbit anti-integrin β1A and β1D antibodies were generated as described previously (42Kim Y.Y. Lim C.S. Song Y.H. Ahnn J. Park D. Song W.K. Cell Adhes. Commun. 1999; 7: 85-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar).

Ser/Thr phosphatase assay system was from Promega (Madison, WI). Fluo-3/AM was from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR).Mutation of Integrin β1A—Mutant integrin β1A constructs were generated from pHSX-β1X encoding full-length human β1A integrin subunit (56Retta S.F. Balzac F. Ferraris P. Belkin A.M. Fassler R. Humphries M.J. Leo G.D. Silengo L. Tarone G. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 715-731Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The integrin β1A was cloned into pDsRed1-N1 (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA) by the unique XhoI and BamHI restriction sites. Mutants were generated by oligonucleotide-primed DNA synthesis using the QuickChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The following mutants were constructed by PCR: T788N using the forward primer 5′-ATAAGAGTGCCGTAAACACTGTGGTCAATCCG and the reverse primer 5′-CCGATTGACCACAGTGTTTACGGCACTCTTAT; T789N using the forward primer 5′-AGAGTGCCGTAACAAATGTGGTCAATCCGAAG and the reverse primer 5′-CTTCGGATTGACCACATTTGTTACGGCACTCT; T788N/T789N using the forward primer 5′-ATAAGAGTGCCGTAAACAATGTGGTCAATCCGAAG and reverse primer 5′-CTTCGGATTGACCACATTGTTTACGGCACTCTTAT. Plasmids were sequenced to confirm the integrity of the newly constructed mutants.Cell Culture and Transfections—E63 cells, a myogenic clone of L8 rat skeletal myoblasts, were grown in DMEM supplemented with 10% HS, 100 units/ml penicillin G, 100 μg/ml streptomycin sulfate, and 250 μg/ml amphotericin in a humidified atmosphere of 90% air, 5% CO2 at 37 °C as described previously (43Kaufman S.J. Parks C.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 3888-3892Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). At confluence, differentiation medium (2% HS) was added to induce myotube formation. The expression vectors were transiently introduced into the cells using the LipofectAMINE PLUS reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions.Intracellular Calcium Measurement using Confocal Microscopy—Measurement of [Ca2+]i by confocal microscopy was performed according to the methods of Kwon et al. (1Kwon M.S. Park C.S. Choi K. Park C.-S. Ahnn J. Kim J.I. Eom S.H. Kaufman S.J. Song W.K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 1433-1443Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Cells cultured on 0.2% (w/v) gelatin-coated coverslips were rinsed twice with bath solution (140 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 0.5 mm MgCl2, 20 mm glucose, 2.5 mm CaCl2, 5.5 mm HEPES, pH 7.4) and then incubated in the dark for 1 h at 25 °C in bath solution containing 5 μm fluo-3/AM. Ca2+ measurements in single cells were made using a Leica (Nussloch, Germany) TCS 4D laser scanning microscope equipped with an argon/krypton laser to excite the dye at 488 nm. Elevation of [Ca2+]i was initiated by adding the appropriate anti-integrin α7 antibodies (15 μg/ml) to the tissue chamber. Images (512 × 512 pixels) were obtained at a rate of 1 image/3 s. In order to quantify fluorescence, pixel intensities within the selected single cell areas of interest were measured and averaged. The acquired data were analyzed using Microsoft Excel version 4.0 (Redmond, WA). Mean intensity (Imean) was defined as an average of fluorescence intensity obtained from each pixel in the selected area, whereas average Imean was calculated from Imean. Independent experiments were repeated at least five times with the same gain. Cells exhibiting a calcium influx following treatment with the ionophore A23187 (Sigma) were regarded as viable cells.Immunoprecipitation and Immunoblotting—E63 cells were washed three times in cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and then lysed with extraction buffer containing 200 mm n-octyl-β-d-glucopyranoside (Sigma), 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 2 mm PMSF, 20 μg/ml aprotinin, and 12.5 μg/ml leupeptin for 1 h at 4 °C. The cell lysate was centrifuged for 10 min at 12,000 × g, and protein concentrations were determined using BCA-based assay (Bio-Rad). Lysates were either analyzed directly by immunoblotting or used for immunoprecipitation. For immunoprecipitation, 1 mg of total protein was incubated overnight at 4 °C with 20 μg/ml anti-integrin β1A antibody (42Kim Y.Y. Lim C.S. Song Y.H. Ahnn J. Park D. Song W.K. Cell Adhes. Commun. 1999; 7: 85-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) or 20 μg/ml anti-integrin β1D antibody (42Kim Y.Y. Lim C.S. Song Y.H. Ahnn J. Park D. Song W.K. Cell Adhes. Commun. 1999; 7: 85-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) followed by incubation with protein G-Sepharose beads or protein A-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences) for 4 h at 4 °C with constant agitation. Immune complexes were treated with SDS sample buffer (5% glycerol, 100 mm dithiothreitol, 2% SDS, 0.01% bromphenol blue, and 125 mm Tris, pH 6.8) and subjected to SDS-PAGE. Following electrophoresis, proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, and the membranes was blocked for 1 h at room temperature with TBS containing 0.1% Tween 20 (TBST) and 5% dry milk or 5% bovine serum albumin. The blots were incubated for 1 h at room temperature with indicated antibodies, diluted TBST. The blots were then washed three times in TBST and incubated an additional hour with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit or anti-mouse immunoglobulin. The proteins were detected using ECL according to the manufacturer's protocol. In some cases, the membranes were then stripping buffer (100 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 2% SDS, and 62.5 mm Tris, pH 6.7) and reprobed.To determine the association between PP2A and integrin β1A or β1D in the presence of OA, cells were incubated with 100 nm OA for 2 h at 37 °C. To examine the change in phosphorylation level in the presence of OA, cells were added with 100 nm OA and maintained at 37 °C in serum-free DMEM.In Vitro Phosphatase Assay—The 4-day-old cultured cells were collected and homogenized in 1 ml of storage buffer (50 mm imidazole, 0.2 mm EGTA, and 0.02% β-mercaptoethanol) containing 1% Triton X-100, 2 mm PMSF, 20 μg/ml aprotinin, and 12.5 μg/ml leupeptin. The lysate was centrifuged for 1 h at 100,000 × g, and the supernatant was passed through a Sephadex G-25 column. The supernatants were centrifuged at 600 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. The supernatant (crude PP2A) was used in an in vitro phosphatase assay.The 4-day-old cultured cells were washed three times in cold PBS and then lysed with RIPA buffer containing 1% Triton X-100, 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 2 mm PMSF, 20 μg/ml aprotinin, and 12.5 μg/ml leupeptin for 1 h at 4 °C. Cell lysate was centrifuged for 10 min at 12,000 × g, and protein concentrations were determined using BCA-based assay. 1 mg of lysates was incubated overnight at 4 °C with anti-B regulatory subunit antibody, followed by incubation with protein G-Sepharose beads or protein A-Sepharose beads for 4 h at 4 °C. Immune complexes were treated with storage buffer and subjected to an in vitro phosphatase assay.Reaction components (50 μl) including 200 μm substrate (synthetic phosphopeptides; β1A (KWDpTGENPIYKpSAVpTpTVV), β1A1 (KWDpTGEN), β1A2 (IYKpSAVT), β1A3 (SAVpTTVV), β1A4 (AVTpTVVN), β1D1 (KWDpTQEN), and β1D2 (IYKSpPIN)), PP2A reaction buffer (50 mm imidazole, pH 7.2), 0.2 mm EGTA, 0.02% β-mercaptoethanol, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and inhibitors (1 mm vanadate, 50 nm or 1 μm OA) were incubated for 5 min at room temperature followed by incubation for 30 min with crude PP2A or purified PP2A (AC dimer; core enzyme, Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., Lake Placid, NY). After the reaction, 50 μl of molybdate dye was added to stop the phosphatase reaction. The color reaction was analyzed in an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay reader (BioTek Instrument, Inc., Winooski, VT) with a 600 nm filter. This experiment was repeated at least five times.Immunofluorescence Microscopy—E63 cells cultured on 0.2% gelatin-coated coverslips were washed twice with PBS and fixed for 10 min at room temperature in 2% paraformaldehyde solution. The cells were then washed with PBS. Cells were permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 and washed again. Cells were washed and incubated for 60 min with anti-vinculin antibody or anti-paxillin antibody, washed three times for 10 min, and incubated for 60 min with TRITC-conjugated donkey anti-mouse immunoglobulin. Cells were mounted with 90% glycerol and 0.1% o-phenylenediamine in PBS. Immunofluorescence was analyzed using a Leica DMRBE microscope equipped with a ×63 objective lens and filters for epifluorescence. Images were captured using a CoolSNAP digital camera (RP Photometrics, Tucson, AZ) with and analyzed by Meta Imaging Series™ software (version 5.0) from Universal Imaging Corp. (West Chester, PA).RESULTSPP2A Inhibitors Block the Elevation of [Ca2+]i in E63 Myoblasts—Integrin ligation has been shown to result in activation of a variety of cellular signaling pathways (8Ginsberg M.H.

In skeletal muscle cells, we demonstrated previously (1Kwon M.S. Park C.S. Choi K. Park C.-S. Ahnn J. Kim J.I. Eom S.H. Kaufman S.J. Song W.K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 1433-1443Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) that binding of integrin α7 antibody or LN to integrin induced both Ca2+ release from inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate-sensitive SR Ca2+ stores and extracellular Ca2+ influx through L-type Ca2+ channels. Changes in the cytosolic free calcium concentration ([Ca2+]i) mediated by integrin have been reported in a variety of cell types and can be used as an indicator of integrin activation (1Kwon M.S. Park C.S. Choi K. Park C.-S. Ahnn J. Kim J.I. Eom S.H. Kaufman S.J. Song W.K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 1433-1443Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 41Richardson A. Parsons J.T. BioEssays. 1995; 17: 229-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). By utilizing integrin antibody-/LN-induced changes of [Ca2+]i, we investigated the relationship between integrin activation and the relative state of phosphorylation of the integrin cytoplasmic domain. E63 myogenic cells elicited the elevation of [Ca2+]i by the addition of integrin α7 antibody (O26, 15 μg/ml) (1Kwon M.S. Park C.S. Choi K. Park C.-S. Ahnn J. Kim J.I. Eom S.H. Kaufman S.J. Song W.K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 1433-1443Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), which specifically binds to the extracellular domain of the integrin α7 subunit, or by the addition of LN (100 μg/ml). The elevation of [Ca2+]i in undifferentiated myoblasts (4-day-old culture, Fig. 1, A and B) was completely blocked by pretreatment with OA (100 nm) or ETL (100 μm), Ser/Thr-phosphatase inhibitors (46Millward T.A. Zolnierowicz S. Hemmings B.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 186-191Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (702) Google Scholar, 47Mumby M.C. Walter G. Physiol. Rev. 1993; 73: 673-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (623) Google Scholar). In contrast, the pretreatment with OA or ETL on differentiated myotubes (8-day culture) did not inhibit the integrin-mediated [Ca2+]i elevation (Fig. 1, A and B). The inhibitory effect of OA or ETL evident in these experiment, therefore, indicates that integrin activation is closely related to its phosphorylation status (48Davare M.A. Horne M.C. Hell J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 39710-39717Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar), and the differential sensitivity of myoblasts and myotubes to these phosphatase inhibitors may be due to the different regulatory mechanisms controlling phosphorylation and/or due to the presence of different integrin isoforms.Okadaic Acid Increases the Level of Phosphorylation of Integrin β1A—The integrin β1 undergoes an isoform switch from β1A to β1D during myogenesis. The integrin β1A isoform is expressed on myoblasts, and the β1D isoform is predominantly expressed on myotubes (Fig. 2A, 49de Melker A.A. Sonnenberg A.

https://openalex.org/W2050179344,"Cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) is a member of the ABC protein superfamily. Phosphorylation of a regulatory domain of this protein is a prerequisite for activity. We analyzed the effect of protein kinase A (PKA) phosphorylation on the structure of purified and reconstituted CFTR protein. 1H/2H exchange monitored by attenuated total reflection Fourier transform IR spectroscopy demonstrates that CFTR is highly accessible to aqueous medium. Phosphorylation of the regulatory (R) domain by PKA further increases this accessibility. More specifically, fluorescence quenching of cytosolic tryptophan residues revealed that the accessibility of the cytoplasmic part of the protein is modified by phosphorylation. Moreover, the combination of polarized IR spectroscopy with 1H/2H exchange suggested an increase of the accessibility of the transmembrane domains of CFTR. This suggests that CFTR phosphorylation can induce a large conformational change that could correspond either to a displacement of the R domain or to long range conformational changes transmitted from the phosphorylation sites to the nucleotide binding domains and the transmembrane segments. Such structural changes may provide better access for the solutes to the nucleotide binding domains and the ion binding site.

CFTR is a member of the ABC superfamily. As the other members of this family, CFTR contains two transmembrane domains and two nucleotide binding domains (NBD) responsible for ATP hydrolysis. In addition to the common ABC structure, CFTR possesses an R domain (regulatory domain) that contains several consensus phosphorylation sites. Phosphorylation of this domain followed by ATP binding and hydrolysis by the NBDs is necessary to induce chloride permeability (2Li C. Ramjeesingh M. Wang W. Garami E. Hewryk M. Lee D. Rommens J.M.

Moreover, overexpression or addition of the unphosphorylated R domain, encompassing residues 590-858, inhibits chloride transport (9Ma J. Tasch J.E. Tao T. Zhao J. Xie J. Drumm M.L. Davis P.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7351-7356Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). PKA phosphorylation relieves this inhibition. On the other hand, it has been shown that exogenous phosphorylated R domain (either residues 590-858, 645-834, or 708-831) increases the open probability of a CFTR channel construct missing residues 708-835 from the R domain (7Ma J.

Effectively, it has been shown that PKA phosphorylates the R domain with a stoichiometry of 5 mol/mol in vitro. Site-directed mutagenesis and tryptic phosphopeptide mapping showed the phosphorylation of 5 serines in vivo (Ser-660, Ser-700, Ser-737, Ser-795, and Ser-813) (12Cheng S.H. Rich D.P. Marshall J.

Mass spectrometry allows the detection of 8 phosphorylated serines (the same sites, plus Ser-712, Ser-768, and Ser-753) (14Neville D.C. Rozanas C.R. Price E.M. Gruis D.B. Verkman A.S. Townsend R.R.

Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 1865-1873Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, the mutation of all these serines as well as the mutation of the 10 dibasic consensus sites, did not prevent PKA-dependent opening of the channel (16Chang X.B. Tabcharani J.A. Hou Y.X.

Chem. 1993; 268: 11304-11311Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that phosphorylation of monobasic and low affinity phosphorylation sites can relieve, partly at least, the inhibitory effect of the R domain. Furthermore, the substitution of serines by negatively charged aspartates relieves R domain inhibition (17Rich D.P. Berger H.A. Cheng S.H. Travis S.M. Saxena M. Smith A.E. Welsh M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20259-20267Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that the negative charges of the phosphate groups play a major role in this process. Even though the role of phosphorylation on CFTR activity has been widely studied, the only structural information regarding CFTR phosphorylation that has been obtained so far concerned soluble R domains (11Ostedgaard L.S.

Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 4072-4079Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). In the present study, we reconstituted active CFTR in proteoliposomes and analyzed the effect of PKA phosphorylation both on the entire protein and on specific regions of CFTR distinct from the R domain. 1H/2H exchange combined with polarized and unpolarized ATR-FTIR spectroscopy, as well as tryptophan fluorescence quenching by acrylamide were used to detect modifications of solvent accessibility occurring specifically in the transmembrane or cytosolic domains of CFTR upon PKA phosphorylation of the R domain. Materials—D2O was from Merck, nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid resin was from Qiagen, m3a7 CFTR primary antibody and anti-mouse secondary antibody were from Chemicon, ECL+ Western blot detection kit was from Amersham Biosciences, pentadecafluorooctanoic acid (PFO) was from Fluorochem, SM2 Bio-Beads were from Bio-Rad, bovine c-AMP-dependant protein kinase A catalytic domain was from Promega, and bovine alkaline phosphatase was from Sigma. All other reagents were from Merck and Sigma. Homemade software programs necessary for the analysis of IR spectra were written in Matlab (The Mathworks). Production and Purification of CFTR-His Proteins—Procedures describing production and purification of CFTR-His proteins were published previously (19Ramjeesingh M. Li C. Garami E. Huan L.J. Hewryk M. Wang Y. Galley K. Bear C.E. Biochem. J. 1997; 327: 17-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 20Ramjeesingh M. Garami E. Galley K. Li C. Wang Y. Bear C.E. Methods Enzymol. 1999; 294: 227-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Briefly, Sf9-baculovirus expression system was used for large scale production of wild type CFTR. Crude plasma membranes from frozen Sf9 cell pellets expressing recombinant CFTR-His proteins were solubilized in 8% PFO, 25 mm phosphate, pH 8.0. Purification of CFTR-His protein was performed using nickel affinity chromatography. The solubilized sample was applied to a freshly generated nickel column at a rate of 1 ml/min. A pH gradient of 8.0-6.0 was then applied to the column using a liquid chromatography pump and gradient former from Bio-Rad. 5-ml fractions were collected. Dot blot was used for CFTR detection in the fractions eluted from the column. Immunopositive fractions were selected and further analyzed by silver-stained 6% SDS/polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and Western blotting. Fractions of high purity were then concentrated in a Centricon YM-100 concentrator from Millipore. Reconstitution of CFTR-His Proteins—A film of asolectin was formed by evaporation of chloroform under a stream of N2, followed by overnight drying under vacuum. Liposomes were prepared by sonication of the lipid film (7 min, on a 250-watt Vibra Cell Sonifier) in 6.5 ml of reconstitution buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, 75 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm EDTA, and 1 mm dithiothreitol, pH 7.2). The sonicated phospholipid solution containing 1 mg of lipids was mixed with 50 μl of PFO 3%. The mixture was stirred continuously for 20 min at room temperature. Purified protein, dissolved in 4% PFO, was added to lipid/detergent-mixed micelles, at a 1/20 (w/w) protein/lipid ratio, and the volume was adjusted to 1 ml with reconstitution buffer. The detergent/protein/phospholipid mixture was stirred for 30 min at room temperature, and the detergent was removed by six incubations with SM2 Bio-Beads (previously washed with methanol and MilliQ water) at 4 °C. The supernatant collected from SM2 Bio-Beads was mixed with an equal volume of 80% sucrose and overlaid with a 30 to 10% sucrose linear gradient. After an overnight centrifugation at 120,000 × g in a Beckman L7 ultracentrifuge, the gradient was fractionated from the bottom of the tube. The phospholipids and protein distribution were measured, respectively, by the enzymatic colorimetric assay for phosphatidylcholine (Roche Applied Science) and by tryptophan fluorescence (excitation = 290 nm, and emission = 330 nm). Phosphorylation and Dephosphorylation of CFTR-His Proteins—Half of the reconstituted CFTR protein batch was phosphorylated by the catalytic subunit of PKA for 1 h at room temperature (20Ramjeesingh M. Garami E. Galley K. Li C. Wang Y. Bear C.E. Methods Enzymol. 1999; 294: 227-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation reaction mixture contained 250 nm catalytic subunit of PKA, 1 mm MgCl2, and 500 μm ATP in 50 mm Tris-HCl, 50 mm NaCl, pH 7.5. The other half of the reconstituted protein was dephosphorylated in the same reaction mixture with alkaline phosphatase in place of PKA. PKA and alkaline phosphatase were removed by ultracentrifugation at 180,000 × g for 2 h. The pellets containing the proteoliposomes were resuspended in 2 mm Hepes, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.2, and the absence of residual kinase and phosphatase was assessed by 6% SDS/polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Uptake of Chloride by Proteoliposomes—A concentrative tracer uptake assay, described previously (20Ramjeesingh M. Garami E. Galley K. Li C. Wang Y. Bear C.E. Methods Enzymol. 1999; 294: 227-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), was used to measure 36Cl- flux into proteoliposomes containing purified and reconstituted CFTR protein. Intravesicular 36Cl- was assayed after incubation of proteoliposomes at 33 °C for 60 min, in the presence of MgATP, for phosphorylated and dephosphorylated samples. Attenuated Total Reflection Fourier Transform IR Spectroscopy— ATR-FTIR spectra were recorded, at room temperature, on a Bruker IFS55 FTIR spectrophotometer equipped with a liquid nitrogen-cooled mercury-cadmium-telluride detector at a nominal resolution of 2 cm-1 and encoded every 1 cm-1. The spectrophotometer was continuously purged with air dried on a FTIR purge gas generator (75-62 Balston, Maidstone, UK). The internal reflection element (ATR) was a germanium plate (50 × 20 × 2 mm) with an aperture angle of 45°, yielding 25 internal reflections (21Goormaghtigh E. Raussens V. Ruysschaert J.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1422: 105-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar). Sample Preparation—Thin films of oriented multilayers were obtained by slowly evaporating the sample on one side of the ATR plate under a stream of nitrogen (22Fringeli U.P. Gunthard H.H. Mol. Biol. Biochem. Biophys. 1981; 31: 270-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). The ATR plate was then sealed in a universal sample holder. The sample contained 20 μg of reconstituted phosphorylated or dephosphorylated CFTR. Secondary Structure Analysis—512 scans were averaged for each measurement. The spectra were corrected for atmospheric water absorption as described previously (23Goormaghtigh E. de Jongh H.H. Ruysschaert J.M. Appl. Spectrosc. 1996; 50: 1519-1527Crossref Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 24Grimard V. Vigano C. Margolles A. Wattiez R. van Veen H.W. Konings W.N. Ruysschaert J.M. Goormaghtigh E. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 11876-11886Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Secondary structure content was determined by comparison with the spectra of 50 proteins from a reference data base. For all spectra, a baseline was subtracted between 1700, 1600, and 1500 cm-1, and the spectra were normalized between 1700 and 1500 cm-1. A linear model containing two wavenumbers was constructed from the reference data base for each secondary structure and applied to the CFTR spectra. Both the protein data base and the mathematical model have been described previously in the case of circular dichroism (25Raussens V. Ruysschaert J.M. Goormaghtigh E. Anal. Biochem. 2003; 319: 114-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Kinetics of Deuteration—Films containing 20 μg of reconstituted phosphorylated or dephosphorylated CFTR were prepared on a germanium plate as described above. Before starting the deuteration, 10 spectra of the sample were recorded to test the stability of the measurements and the reproducibility of the area determination. At zero time, a 2H2O-saturated N2 flux, at a flow rate of 100 ml/min (controlled by a Brooks flow meter), was applied to the sample. For each kinetic time point, 24 spectra were recorded and averaged at a resolution of 2 cm-1. The resulting spectra were corrected for atmospheric water absorption and side-chain contribution as described previously (23Goormaghtigh E. de Jongh H.H. Ruysschaert J.M. Appl. Spectrosc. 1996; 50: 1519-1527Crossref Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 24Grimard V. Vigano C. Margolles A. Wattiez R. van Veen H.W. Konings W.N. Ruysschaert J.M. Goormaghtigh E. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 11876-11886Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The area of Amide II, characteristic of the δ(N-H) vibration, was obtained by integration between 1575 and 1505 cm-1. For each spectrum, the area of Amide II was divided by the area of the lipid ester vibration band integrated between 1780 and 1700 cm-1, to correct for any change in total intensity of the spectra during the deuteration process. This ratio, expressed as a percentage was plotted versus deuteration time. The 100% value is defined by the Amide II/lipid ratio obtained before deuteration. The 0% value corresponds to a zero absorption in the Amide II region, observed for the full deuteration of a protein (27Goormaghtigh E. Cabiaux V. Ruysschaert J.M. Subcell. Biochem. 1994; 23: 363-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Polarized ATR-FTIR Spectroscopy—Films containing 20 μg of reconstituted phosphorylated or dephosphorylated CFTR were prepared on a germanium plate as described above. Spectra were recorded with the incident light polarized parallel and perpendicular with respect to the incidence plane before and after 12-h deuteration. For each spectrum, 512 scans were recorded and averaged, and the resulting spectra were corrected for atmospheric water absorption (23Goormaghtigh E. de Jongh H.H. Ruysschaert J.M. Appl. Spectrosc. 1996; 50: 1519-1527Crossref Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 24Grimard V. Vigano C. Margolles A. Wattiez R. van Veen H.W. Konings W.N. Ruysschaert J.M. Goormaghtigh E. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 11876-11886Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Dichroism spectra were computed by subtracting the perpendicular polarized spectrum from the parallel polarized spectrum. The subtraction coefficient was chosen so that the area of the lipid ester band equals zero on the dichroism spectrum, to take into account the difference in the relative power of the evanescent field for each polarization as described before (29Bechinger B. Ruysschaert J.M. Goormaghtigh E. Biophys. J. 1999; 76: 552-563Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Fluorescence Quenching Experiments—Acrylamide quenching experiments were carried out on a SLM Aminco 8000 fluorometer at an excitation wavelength of 290 nm to reduce the absorbance of acrylamide. Acrylamide aliquots were added from a 3 m solution to the proteoliposome suspension containing 5 μg of reconstituted phosphorylated or dephosphorylated CFTR. Fluorescence intensities were measured at 330 nm after each addition of quencher. All measurements were carried out at 25 °C. Acrylamide quenching data were analyzed according to the Stern-Volmer equation for collisional quenching (30Lehrer S.S. Biochemistry. 1971; 10: 3254-3263Crossref PubMed Scopus (1654) Google Scholar). Purification and Active Reconstitution of CFTR—The use of biophysical techniques such as ATR-FTIR and fluorescence spectroscopy requires purified and reconstituted proteoliposomes with a relatively high protein to lipid ratio (21Goormaghtigh E. Raussens V. Ruysschaert J.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1422: 105-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar, 30Lehrer S.S. Biochemistry. 1971; 10: 3254-3263Crossref PubMed Scopus (1654) Google Scholar). Purification of His-tagged CFTR was performed as previously described (19Ramjeesingh M. Li C. Garami E. Huan L.J. Hewryk M. Wang Y. Galley K. Bear C.E. Biochem. J. 1997; 327: 17-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) and yielded a well purified protein as shown on a silver-stained polyacrylamide gel and by Western blot (see Fig. 1). The diffuse band is due to the variation of glycosylation considering the expression in Sf9 insect cells (31Kartner N. Hanrahan J.W. Jensen T.J. Naismith A.L. Sun S.Z. Ackerley A.A. Reyes E.F. Tsui L.C. Rommens J.M. Bear C.E. Riordan J.R. Cell. 1991; 64: 681-691Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar). To reconstitute CFTR, Bio-Beads were used to remove the detergent (32Rigaud J.L. Pitard B. Levy D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1231: 223-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar). After several incubations with the Bio-Beads, the sample was applied to a sucrose gradient (Fig. 2). A homogeneous population of proteoliposomes migrated at a density of 1.10 g/cm3. No protein was observed elsewhere in the gradient. The diameter of these proteoliposomes evaluated by photon correlation spectroscopy was found to be 148.0 ± 0.8 nm (results not shown). These proteoliposomes appeared to be suitable for spectroscopic purposes, with a protein to lipid ratio of 1/30 (w/w).Fig. 2Sucrose gradient profile of actively reconstituted CFTR. After centrifugation, fractions were collected from the bottom to the top of the gradient and measured for protein (solid line) and lipid (dashed line) content as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The y-axis represents the percentage of proteins or lipids in a fraction relative to the total amount.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Extensive phosphorylation by PKA or dephosphorylation by alkaline phosphatase was performed as previously described (20Ramjeesingh M. Garami E. Galley K. Li C. Wang Y. Bear C.E. Methods Enzymol. 1999; 294: 227-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The chloride channel activity of this sample was evaluated by monitoring the uptake of radioactive chloride ions. Fig. 3 shows that phosphorylated CFTR was effectively able to transport chloride ions at a rate of 145 nmol/μg of protein per hour. When CFTR was dephosphorylated, the chloride flux drops significantly to a rate of 80 nmol/μg of protein. Phosphorylation-induced Conformational Changes—The reconstituted sample was used for ATR-FTIR experiments. The IR spectrum of a protein is mainly characterized by two bands, the Amide I and Amide II, due mainly to the absorption of the amide ν(C=O) and δ(N-H) vibrations, respectively (21Goormaghtigh E. Raussens V. Ruysschaert J.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1422: 105-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar). The Amide I is located between 1700 and 1600 cm-1, and its shape is particularly sensitive to the secondary structure (33Goormaghtigh E. Cabiaux V. Ruysschaert J.M. Subcell. Biochem. 1994; 23: 405-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). The comparison of the Amide I shape of phosphorylated and dephosphorylated CFTR shown in Fig. 4 reveals no significant change. Secondary structure content was further determined for the two samples (Table I) by comparison with the spectra of a 50-protein data base (25Raussens V. Ruysschaert J.M. Goormaghtigh E. Anal. Biochem. 2003; 319: 114-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Due to the proximity of β-strands and random coil absorption in the Amide 1 band (33Goormaghtigh E. Cabiaux V. Ruysschaert J.M. Subcell. Biochem. 1994; 23: 405-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar), a small underestimation of the β-strands content is possible. However, we can see that no significant change of secondary structure occurs upon CFTR phosphorylation.Table ISecondary structure of CFTR Secondary structures were determined as described under “Experimental Procedures” for dephosphorylated (CFTR-dP) and phosphorylated (CFTR-P) CFTR. Numbers are given in percentages. Values are the mean of three experiments and are given with indication of the standard deviation.α-Helicesβ-Strandsβ-TurnsRandom coilCFTR-dP45 ± 41 ± 117 ± 237 ± 3CFTR-P47 ± 22 ± 216 ± 235 ± 2 Open table in a new tab Because the tertiary structure could change in the absence of significant secondary structure modification, we monitored 1H/2H exchange kinetics for the phosphorylated and the dephosphorylated samples. After exposure to 2H2O, the labile hydrogens from the amide bonds are exchanged by deuterium. This results in the decrease of the area of the Amide II band located between 1575 and 1505 cm-1. This decrease can be related to the solvent accessibility and the secondary structures stability (Fig. 5) (27Goormaghtigh E. Cabiaux V. Ruysschaert J.M. Subcell. Biochem. 1994; 23: 363-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). The exchange observed here is fast in comparison with other proteins, because 70% of the amide hydrogens are already exchanged after 20 min. The phosphorylation induces an increase of the 1H/2H exchange, giving rise to 90% of exchange in the same time interval (Fig. 6). These exchange curves can be fitted by a multiexponential decay corresponding to the different groups of amide protons exchanging at various rates (27Goormaghtigh E. Cabiaux V. Ruysschaert J.M. Subcell. Biochem. 1994; 23: 363-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Table II shows that the population of the fast exchanging protons is enhanced by 32% upon phosphorylation. A corresponding decrease is observed in the two others proton populations.Fig. 6Exchange curves for actively reconstituted CFTR.

The first one takes advantage of the intrinsic fluorescence of tryptophan residues. Tryptophan residues give rise to a fluorescence emission with a maximum wavelength at 330 nm. The aqueous quencher acrylamide induces a decrease of the fluorescence, which depends on the accessibility of the cytosolic tryptophans to the quencher (34Eftink M.R. Ghiron C.A. Biochemistry. 1976; 15: 672-680Crossref PubMed Scopus (986) Google Scholar). Because no tryptophans are located in the R domain, the measure will reflect changes occurring outside this domain. Quenching was observed for the phosphorylated as well as for the dephosphorylated samples, but the intensity of the effect was more pronounced for the phosphorylated CFTR, demonstrating that the tryptophans are more accessible to acrylamide in this conformational state (Fig. 7). The second method was developed previously in our laboratory (24Grimard V. Vigano C. Margolles A. Wattiez R. van Veen H.W. Konings W.N. Ruysschaert J.M. Goormaghtigh E.

Because full-length RAG proteins are insoluble under physiologic conditions, most previous analyses of RAG activity in vitro have used truncated core RAG-1 and RAG-2 fragments. These studies identified an intermediate in V(D)J recombination, the signal end complex (SEC), in which core RAG proteins remain associated with recombination signal sequences at the cleaved signal ends. From transfected cells expressing affinity-tagged RAG proteins, we have isolated in vivo assembled SECs containing full-length RAG proteins and cleaved recombination substrates. SEC formation in vivo did not require the repair proteins DNA-dependent protein kinase, Ku80, or XRCC4. In the presence of full-length RAG-2, SEC formation in vivo was cell cycle-regulated and restricted to the G0/G1 phases. In contrast, complexes accumulated throughout cell cycle in cells expressing a RAG-2 CDK2 phosphorylation site mutant. Both core and full-length SECs supported transposition in vitro with similar efficiencies. Intracellular SECs, which are likely to persist in the absence of coding ends, represent potential donors whose transposition is not suppressed by the non-core regions of the RAG proteins.

Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2002; 71: 101-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (608) Google Scholar). The coding and signal ends generated by RAG-mediated DNA cleavage are resolved discordantly in vivo (5Roth D.B. Nakajima P.B. Menetski J.P. Bosma M.J. Gellert M. Cell. 1992; 69: 41-53Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 6Ramsden D.A. Gellert M.

Although coding ends are repaired quickly, signal ends are relatively long-lived. Whereas genetic approaches have proven powerful in identifying proteins that participate in the joining phase of V(D)J recombination, the precise molecular mechanism remains obscure. RAG-1 and RAG-2 are 1040 and 527 amino acid residues long, respectively. Core fragments comprising residues 384-1008 of RAG-1 and 1-387 of RAG-2 support recombination of extrachromosomal substrates and are more readily isolated than the full-length proteins (8Sadofsky M.J. Hesse J.E. Gellert M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 1805-1809Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 9Cuomo C.A. Oettinger M.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 1810-1814Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). For this reason, studies of V(D)J recombination in vitro have largely employed these forms (4McBlane J.F. van Gent D.C. Ramsden D.A. Romeo C. Cuomo C.A. Gellert M.

Cell. 1996; 85: 107-113Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). Nonetheless, the RAG-1 and RAG-2 non-core regions are conserved phylogenetically and regulatory functions have been ascribed to them. The non-core region of RAG-2, for example, couples V(D)J recombination to the cell cycle by supporting the periodic destruction of RAG-2 protein, which accumulates preferentially in G0/G1 cells and is degraded at the G1-S transition in dividing cells (12Li Z. Dordai D.I. Lee J. Desiderio S. Immunity. 1996; 5: 575-589Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 13Lin W.C. Desiderio S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The degradation signal overlaps an importin 5 (karyopherin β 3) binding site required for efficient nuclear uptake of RAG-2 in dividing cells (15Ross A.E. Vuica M. Desiderio S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 5308-5319Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Removal of the non-core region has been reported to reduce the efficiency of recombination within extrachromosomal substrates (8Sadofsky M.J. Hesse J.E. Gellert M.

After DNA cleavage in vitro, the core RAG-1 and RAG-2 proteins remain associated stably with the cleaved RSSs (23Agrawal A. Schatz D.G. Cell. 1997; 89: 43-53Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar, 24Jones J.M. Gellert M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 12926-12931Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). In this signal end complex (SEC), the DNA ends are sequestered from the NHEJ apparatus (24Jones J.M. Gellert M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 12926-12931Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). In vitro, the SEC is able to support the integration of signal ends into a recipient DNA molecule, but it remains an open question whether this is a significant source of genomic instability in vivo. At concentrations that mimic intracellular conditions, Mg2+ and GTP suppress RAG-mediated transposition in vitro (25Melek M. Gellert M. Cell. 2000; 101: 625-633Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 26Tsai C.L. Schatz D.G. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 1922-1930Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Mg2+ promotes the reversal of the transposition reaction in a process termed disintegration (25Melek M. Gellert M. Cell. 2000; 101: 625-633Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). GTP selectively suppresses RAG-mediated transposition by inhibiting target capture while sparing DNA cleavage by the RAG complex (26Tsai C.L. Schatz D.G. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 1922-1930Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Either of these mechanisms may act to suppress RAG-mediated transposition in vivo. A third potential mechanism of suppression was suggested by the ability of the RAG non-core regions to inhibit hybrid joint formation in vivo (20Sekiguchi J.A. Whitlow S. Alt F.W. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 1383-1390Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), the chemistry of which resembles that of transposition. Correspondingly, two recent studies have suggested that the full-length RAG proteins carry out transposition with reduced efficiency relative to the core proteins (26Tsai C.L. Schatz D.G. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 1922-1930Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 27Elkin S.K. Matthews A.G. Oettinger M.A. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 1931-1938Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). In this communication, we describe the isolation of intracellular postcleavage complexes containing excised recombination signal ends and the full-length RAG proteins. Similar to SECs formed in vitro with core RAG proteins, the SECs obtained from transfected cells expressing full-length RAG proteins are stable and resistant to exonucleolytic attack. The formation of SECs in vivo is independent of an intact NHEJ machinery. Intracellular accumulation of SECs containing full-length RAG-1 and RAG-2 is coordinated with the cell cycle, in contrast to SECs containing a mutant RAG-2 defective in regulated degradation. We observed no significant difference in the efficiency of transposition supported by SECs formed in vivo with full-length or core RAG proteins. Failure of the RAG non-core regions to suppress transposition in this setting indicates that intracellular SECs are potential sources of genomic instability. If RAG-mediated transposition is inhibited in vivo, the presence of the non-core regions does not seem likely to account for this suppression. Cell Lines—NIH3T3 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% calf serum. CHO-K1 cells or their NHEJ-deficient derivatives xrs-5 (Ku80-deficient), XR-1 (XRCC4-deficient), and V3 (DNA-PKcs-deficient) were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. DNA Constructs—The extrachromosomal recombination substrates pJH200, pJH290, and pDVG42 have been described previously (11van Gent D.C. Ramsden D.A. Gellert M. Cell. 1996; 85: 107-113Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar, 28Hesse J.E. Lieber M.R. Gellert M. Mizuuchi K.

Cell. 1988; 55: 7-16Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). Plasmids pMR1 and pMR2 encoding maltose-binding protein (MBP) fusions to core RAG-1 (residues 384-1008) or core RAG-2 (residues 1-387), tagged at the carboxyl terminus with a Myc epitope and polyhistidine, have been described previously (30Li W. Chang F.C. Desiderio S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 3935-3946Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Plasmids pMFR1 and pMFR2 encoding MBP fusions to full-length RAG-1 or RAG-2, respectively, were generated by PCR-based subcloning. First, an AscI site was introduced at the 3′ end of the MBP cassette and an FseI or EcoRI site was introduced at the 5′ end of the Myc epitope cassette by PCR amplification of plasmid pMR2. A PCR product containing full-length RAG-1 cDNA flanked by AscI and FseI sites or one containing full-length RAG-2 cDNA flanked by AscI and EcoRI sites was then ligated between cognate sites in the appropriate MBP fusion vector. Plasmid pcDNA-MBP expressing MBP alone was created by subcloning an MBP cDNA flanked by BamHI and EcoRI sites into pcDNA1. Plasmids pR1 and pR2 expressing Myc epitope-tagged core RAG-1 or core RAG-2 were generated by PCR subcloning of the corresponding cDNAs from the appropriate MBP fusion vectors using primers directed to the 5′ ends of core RAG-1 or RAG-2 (generating a BamHI site) and to the 3′ end of the Myc epitope (generating a NotI site). The amplified products were subcloned into pcDNA1. All of the DNA constructs were confirmed by nucleotide sequence analysis. Isolation of SECs from Transfected Cells—NIH3T3 or CHO-K1 cell lines were grown to 70% confluency and then cotransfected with plasmids encoding core MBP-RAG-1 and MBP-RAG-2 chimeras (pMR1and pMR2), full-length MBP-RAG-1, and MBP-RAG-2 chimeras (pMFR1 and pMFR2) or combinations of full-length and core proteins as indicated. Cells were cotransfected with an extrachromosomal recombination substrate (pJH200 or pJH290) and pRSVT. Transfections were performed using LipofectAMINE (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. At 36-48 h after transfection, cells were harvested by scraping and the cell pellets were resuspended to ∼108 cells/ml in RSB (10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 10 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 5 μg/ml pepstatin A). Cells were allowed to swell for 5 min at 4 °C. 1.5 volumes of lysis buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 200 mm NaCl, 0.2 mm MgCl2, 0.2% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 5 μg/ml pepstatin A) were then added, and cells were lysed while rocking at 4 °C for 40 min. Cell lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 50 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant was then loaded under gravity onto an equilibrated amylose column (bed volume 1 ml/108 lysed cells). The first flow-through was reloaded. The column was then washed with 10 column volumes of wash buffer (10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.4, 200 mm NaCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 5 μg/ml pepstatin A) containing 0.5% Nonidet P-40 and then with 20 column volumes of wash buffer without Nonidet P-40. SECs were eluted in wash buffer containing 10 mm maltose at a volume of 3 ml/108 lysed cells. Throughout the loading, wash, and elution steps, 1-ml fractions were collected. To prepare fractions for assay of signal ends, 200-μl aliquots were deproteinized by incubating with 500 μg/ml proteinase K in 0.5% SDS, 20 mm Tris, and10 mm EDTA for 1 h at 37 °C followed by phenol-chloroform extraction and precipitation with ethanol. The resuspended DNA was subjected to a ligation-mediated PCR (LM-PCR) assay for signal ends. For detection of RAG fusion proteins, 20-μl samples of appropriate fractions were boiled for 5 min in SDS-PAGE loading buffer and fractionated by electrophoresis through a 4-12% SDS-PAGE gel. Fusion proteins were detected by immunoblotting using the anti-Myc antibody 9e10. Signal End Detection—LM-PCR assays for signal ends were modified from published methods (10van Gent D.C. McBlane J.F. Ramsden D.A. Sadofsky M.J. Hesse J.E. Gellert M. Cell. 1995; 81: 925-934Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar) as follows. Signal ends were first ligated to a linker composed of annealed primers, FM25 (5′-GCGGTGACCGGGAGATCTGAAGTG-3′) and FM11 (5′-CACTTCAGATC-3′). After inactivating DNA ligase by heating to 65 °C for 20 min, PCR was performed using primer FM25 and either OHJ004 (5′-GCTGCTTGCTGTTCTTGAATGG-3′) for RAG complexes formed with pJH290 or NEB1233 (5′-GCGGATAACAATTTCACACAGGA-3′) for RAG complexes formed with pJH200. Following denaturation for 5 min at 94 °C, 28 cycles of amplification were performed, each consisting of 20 s at 94 °C, 30 s at 60 °C, and 20 s at 72 °C. Finally, samples were subjected to extension for 5 min at 72 °C. Products were fractionated by electrophoresis through a 6% polyacrylamide gel and detected by staining with ethidium bromide. Competition Assays—Blunt-ended, RSS-flanked competitor DNA was derived by PCR amplification from pDVG42 using primers OHJ042 (5′-CACAGTGCTACAGACTGGAACAAAAACC-3′) and OHJ043 (5′-CACAGTGGTAGTACTCCACTGTCTGG-3′), which anneal to the heptamers of the 12 and 23 RSSs, respectively. The PCR product was purified by gel electrophoresis and phosphorylated at its 5′ ends using polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs). Competitor was added to the lysis buffer before cell lysis. Lysates were then subjected to amylose chromatography as described above. Cell Cycle Analysis—NIH3T3 cells were transfected with plasmids pMFR1 and either pMFR2 or pMFR2(T490A). Cells were cotransfected with pJH290. At 10 h after transfection, cells were subjected to serum starvation by incubation in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 0.5% calf serum. After 48 h, the concentration of serum was restored to 20% and cells were collected at various times thereafter. For flow cytometric analysis of DNA content, aliquots of cells were fixed overnight at 4 °C in 50% ethanol and then stained at room temperature for 30 min in phosphate-buffered saline containing 100 μg/ml propidium iodide and 10 μg/ml RNase A. Samples were analyzed using a Coulter EPICS 752 flow cytometer. The remaining cells (107) were assayed for SEC formation by amylose affinity chromatography as described above. Transposition Assays—Eluates containing SECs were concentrated from an initial volume of 3 ml to 50 μl by Microcon YM-100 filtration (Millipore). Aliquots (5 μl) were frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80 °C. Transposition reactions (final volume 20 μl) were carried out in a buffer containing 25 mm MOPS, pH 7.0, 100 ng/μl bovine serum albumin, 10% glycerol, 2 mm MgCl2, 60 mm potassium glutamate, and 2 mm dithiothreitol. To some reactions, HMG-1 (100 ng) was added. For each transposition reaction, 5 μl of thawed SEC was incubated with 650 ng of the recipient plasmid pBluescript or pOT2A at 37 °C for 1 h. DNA was then deproteinized by phenol-chloroform extraction, precipitated in ethanol, and resuspended in 30 μl of 10 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.6. A 10-μl sample of eluted DNA was used as template in a PCR reaction using primers OHJ004 and OHJ006 (5′-CTCATCGATGAGAGGATCCCGAG-3′), which anneal within the pJH290 donor. Reactions were supplemented with 1 μCi of [α-32P]dCTP. After denaturation for 5 min at 94 °C, 30 cycles of amplification were performed, each consisting of 30 s at 94 °C, 30 s at 60 °C, and 1 min at 72 °C. Samples were subjected to extension for 15 min at 72 °C after the last cycle. Products were purified using the QIAquick kit (Qiagen), fractionated by electrophoresis through a 4-20% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel or a 1% agarose gel, and visualized using a PhosphorImager. To identify target site duplications, transposition reactions were fractionated on a 1% agarose gel and transposition products were excised. DNA was purified using the QIAquick gel extraction kit and cloned into the pCR2.1 vector (Invitrogen). DNA sequence was determined using M13 forward and reverse primers. Isolation of SECs Containing Full-length RAG Proteins from Transfected Cells—Following DNA cleavage by the RAG proteins in vitro, a stable postcleavage complex between the RAG proteins and signal ends is formed (23Agrawal A. Schatz D.G. Cell. 1997; 89: 43-53Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar, 24Jones J.M. Gellert M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 12926-12931Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). We wished to detect the formation of such complexes in vivo and to isolate them for further study. Plasmids encoding full-length or core RAG proteins fused to MBP at the amino termini and to a c-Myc epitope at the carboxyl termini were cotransfected with an extrachromosomal recombination substrate into NIH3T3 cells. At 48 h after transfection, cell lysates were prepared and fractionated by amylose affinity chromatography. The bound fraction was expected to contain free RAG-1 and RAG-2 as well as any RAG proteins that remained stably associated with DNA, in particular SECs. After loading, the column was washed and the bound RAG proteins were eluted with maltose. Fractions were assayed for the presence of unrecombined substrate and signal joints by conventional PCR and for signal ends by LM-PCR. The presence of RAG-1 and RAG-2 was monitored by immunoblotting (Fig. 1A). The presence of cleaved 12-spacer signal ends (Fig. 1A, middle panel), in contrast to that of unrecombined plasmid (Fig. 1A, upper panel) or signal joints (data not shown), was strongly correlated with the amount of RAG-1 and RAG-2 in each fraction (Fig. 1A, lower panel, and data not shown), which decreased during the wash phase and increased sharply upon elution with maltose. This behavior was consistent with the persistent association of signal ends with the RAG proteins following DNA cleavage. Complexes were detected in lysates of cells expressing any pairwise combination of full-length and core RAG-MBP fusion proteins (Fig. 1C, lanes 6, 9, 12, and 15). The differences in relative yields of SECs were not consistent, and this may reflect the variability inherent in the assay, which couples isolation of small quantities of intermediates with amplification by the PCR. Similar results were obtained using an LM-PCR assay specific for 23-spacer signal ends (data not shown). The recombination substrates pJH200 and pJH290 contain identical RSSs and behaved equivalently in the assay for complex formation. Subsequent experiments therefore employed either pJH200 or pJH290 as indicated. RAG proteins and signal ends could also be released from the column by proteolytic separation of the MBP moiety from the RAG fusion proteins after the binding and wash steps (Fig. 1B). To more rigorously exclude a contribution of the MBP moiety to the binding of cleaved signal ends, MBP was coexpressed with the unfused core RAG proteins in the presence of the extrachromosomal substrate. In this instance, signal ends were detectable in the flow-through fraction but not in the eluate (Fig 1C, lanes 1-3). It has been suggested (23Agrawal A. Schatz D.G. Cell. 1997; 89: 43-53Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar) that SECs formed in vitro in the presence of cell-free extracts may be associated with components of the NHEJ machinery. Although immunoblotting failed to detect Ku80 or XRCC4 in SECs isolated from wild-type CHO-K1 cells (data not shown), we asked whether intact NHEJ might have been required at some previous stage for the formation of the complexes we detected in lysates of transfected cells. To this end, we assayed the formation of SECs in wild-type CHO-K1 cells and in their derivative, the xrs-5 cell line, in which NHEJ is defective because of a lack of functional Ku80 (31Kemp L.M. Sedgwick S.G. Jeggo P.A. Mutat. Res. 1984; 132: 189-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). SECs were detected in lysates of the wild-type and mutant cell lines (Fig. 2A, lanes 3 and 6). SECs were also recovered from mutant CHO cells deficient in DNA-PKCS and its wild-type progenitor (Fig. 2A, lanes 9 and 12) as well as from cells deficient in the NHEJ component XRCC4 (Fig. 2A, lane 15). Although these results do not rule out an effect of NHEJ deficiency on the absolute yield of SECs, they do show that NHEJ is not essential for SEC formation. In vitro, the core RAG proteins form a stable postcleavage complex in which signal ends are protected from exonuclease digestion (24Jones J.M. Gellert M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 12926-12931Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Signal ends are similarly sequestered in the full-length SECs that we isolated from transfected cells. Treatment of these complexes with λ exonuclease did not reduce the amount of signal ends detectable by LM-PCR (Fig. 2B, compare lanes 1 and 2). In contrast, heat denaturation of the complex by incubation for 15 min at 70 °C prior to exonuclease treatment resulted in the complete disappearance of signal ends (Fig. 2B, compare lanes 3 and 4). The resistance of the undenatured SECs to λ exonuclease treatment indicates that the amount of free signal ends present in fractions containing purified SECs must be small. SECs Isolated from Transfected Cells Originate in Vivo—Whereas these results demonstrated an association between RAG proteins and signal ends, it remained possible that some or all of these complexes were formed by the binding of RAG proteins to signal ends after cell lysis rather than within the cell. Additionally, the RAG proteins might have cleaved unrecombined plasmid and become bound to its signal ends after cell lysis. To exclude these possibilities, we performed two competition assays. To rule out binding of RAGs to free signal ends, a linear competitor was derived from the extrachromosomal substrate pDVG42, terminating in 5′-phosphorylated signal ends identical to those of pJH200 or pJH290. We had previously determined using the same experimental system as described above for pJH200 and pJH290 that complexes between the RAG proteins and cleaved pDVG42 can be detected in lysates of transfected cells (data not shown). To assay formation of new complexes from unrecombined substrate, intact pDVG42 was used as a competitor. Cells were transfected with vectors encoding the MBP-RAG fusion proteins and with pJH290. At 48 h after transfection, immediately before lysis, the pDVG42-derived competitor fragment (Fig. 3, A and B) or intact pDVG42 plasmid (Fig. 3, C and D) was added at increasing concentrations. The amounts of linear competitor added were estimated by a preliminary experiment (data not shown) to represent a 10-, 100-, or 1000-fold excess over pJH290 signal ends. The amounts of circular competitor added were set similarly, relative to unrecombined pJH290. Lysates were fractionated by amylose affinity chromatography, and pJH290 signal ends were detected in serially diluted fractions by LM-PCR. The recovery of pJH290 signal ends in the eluate was not significantly diminished, even at a 1000-fold excess of competitor (Fig. 3, A and C, bottom panels, compare lanes 1-3 with lanes 10-12). Moreover, pDVG42 signal ends were not retained on the amylose column in the presence of either competitor (Fig. 3, B and D). Thus, neither the exchange of RAG proteins among signal ends nor the de novo formation of stable RAG-signal end complexes is detectable in vitro under the conditions employed here. These observations strongly support the interpretation that the complexes detected in lysates of transfected cells were formed in vivo. We cannot formally rule out the possibility that these SECs are formed after cell lysis by coupled cleavage within a preexisting paired complex, but this possibility seems unlikely given our observation that the RAG proteins do not maintain stable interactions with intact plasmid DNA under the experimental conditions employed here. SEC Accumulation in the G0and G1Cell Cycle Phases—RAG-2 protein accumulates periodically in dividing cells, accumulating in the G1 cell cycle phase and undergoing rapid degradation at the G1-to-S transition (12Li Z.

https://openalex.org/W2093175008,"The transcriptional activation of the prostaglandin G/H synthase-2 (PGHS-2) gene in granulosa cells is required for ovulation. To directly study the ability of upstream stimulatory factor 1 (USF1) and USF2 to trans-activate the bovine PGHS-2 promoter in granulosa cells, USF1 or USF2 expression vectors were cotransfected with the PGHS-2/luciferase (LUC) chimeric construct, -149/-2PGHS-2.LUC. Results revealed that overexpression of USF1 or USF2 caused a marked and significant increase in basal and forskolin-inducible promoter activities (p < 0.05), and these effects were dependent on the presence of a consensus E-box cis-element within the promoter fragment. Co-transfections with different N- and C-terminal truncated USF mutants led to significant reductions in promoter activation, as compared with full-length constructs (p < 0.05), thus allowing identification of putative bovine USF functional domains. Overexpression of a USF2 truncated mutant lacking the first 220 residues (U2Δ1-220) acted as a dominant negative mutant and blocked endogenous and USF-stimulated PGHS-2 promoter activation. Interestingly, transfections with U2Δ1-220 blocked the forskolin-dependent induction of PGHS-2 mRNA in granulosa cells, whereas transfections with full-length USF2 increased PGHS-2 transcript levels. Immunoblot analyses confirmed overexpression of full-length and truncated USF proteins, and electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs) and supershift EMSAs established that the observed effects were dependent on specific interactions between USF proteins and the consensus E-box cis-element. Stimulation of cells with forskolin increased, whereas treatment of extracts with phosphatase decreased USF binding activities to the E-box. Thus, this study presents for the first time direct evidence for a role of USF proteins in the regulation of the PGHS-2 promoter in preovulatory granulosa cells. The transcriptional activation of the prostaglandin G/H synthase-2 (PGHS-2) gene in granulosa cells is required for ovulation. To directly study the ability of upstream stimulatory factor 1 (USF1) and USF2 to trans-activate the bovine PGHS-2 promoter in granulosa cells, USF1 or USF2 expression vectors were cotransfected with the PGHS-2/luciferase (LUC) chimeric construct, -149/-2PGHS-2.LUC. Results revealed that overexpression of USF1 or USF2 caused a marked and significant increase in basal and forskolin-inducible promoter activities (p < 0.05), and these effects were dependent on the presence of a consensus E-box cis-element within the promoter fragment.

Thus, this study presents for the first time direct evidence for a role of USF proteins in the regulation of the PGHS-2 promoter in preovulatory granulosa cells. Prostaglandins are key mediators of inflammation, and the process of ovulation shares numerous signs of an acute inflammatory reaction, including hyperemia, edema, emigration of leukocytes, and induction of proteolytic and collagenolytic activities (1Espey L.L.

Prostaglandin G/H synthase (PGHS, also known as COX) is the first rate-limiting enzyme in the biosynthesis of all prostaglandins from arachidonic acid, and two PGHS isoforms derived from distinct genes located on separate chromosomes have been characterized, and are referred to as PGHS-1 and PGHS-2 (7Vane J.R.

The obligatory role of PGHS-2 induction during ovulation was underscored in genetic studies in which ovulatory failure proved to be a common phenotype in PGHS-2-deficient female mice (16Lim H.

Alternative USF1 and USF2 splicing variants have also been identified, but their biological significance remains incomplete (22Viollet B. Lefrançois-Martinez A.M. Henrion A. Khan A. Raymondjean M.

The C terminus B-HLH-LZ domains of USF1 and USF2 are highly conserved, and direct the formation of USF homodimers or heterodimers that interact with DNA with similar specificities (19Sirito M.

The cognate DNA binding cis-element for USF proteins, the E-box, contains the core nucleotide sequence CANNTG (18Gregor P.D. Sawadogo M. Roeder R.G.

Another very well conserved domain between USF1 and USF2 is a small domain termed USF-specific region (USR) that is located immediately upstream of the basic region and involved in nuclear localization and context-dependent transcriptional activation (25Luo X. Sawadogo M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1367-1375Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). In contrast, the N-terminal regions of USF1 and USF2 are much more divergent, but were shown to contain additional trans-activation domains (25Luo X. Sawadogo M. Mol. Cell.

DeWitt D.L. Smith W.L. Richards J.S. Mol. Endocrinol. 1989; 3: 1714-1723Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Initial studies on the regulation of the rat and bovine PGHS-2 promoter in granulosa cells revealed that the proximal 150-200 bp immediately upstream of the transcriptional start site were sufficient to confer basal and forskolin/gonadotropin inducible activities (37Sirois J.

Different cis-elements were identified in this region, including a C/EBP, an ATF/CRE and an E-box element. However, site-directed mutagenesis studies showed that only the E-box played a central role in the regulation of the PGHS-2 promoter in granulosa cells (38Liu J. Antaya M. Boerboom D. Lussier J.G.

Endogenous USF proteins were detected in rat and bovine granulosa cells, and potential interactions with the E-box element were suggested from electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs) (38Liu J.

However, there has been no direct evidence demonstrating the capacity of USFs to trans-activate the PGHS-2 promoter in granulosa cells in any species. Therefore, the specific objectives of the present study were to clone and characterize the primary structure of bovine USF1 and USF2, and to provide direct evidence that USF proteins regulate PGHS-2 expression in preovulatory granulosa cells.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—The QuikHyb hybridization solution and the ExAssist/SOLR system were purchased from Stratagene Cloning Systems (La Jolla, CA). The bovine genomic library was obtained from Clontech (Bio/Can Scientific, Ontario, Canada). [α-32P]dCTP was purchased from PerkinElmer Canada Inc. (Woodbridge, Ontario, Canada). LipofectAMINE PLUS reagent, TRIzol total RNA isolation reagent, avian myeloblastosis virus-modified reverse transcriptase, 1-kb DNA ladder, synthetic oligonucleotides, pcDNA 3.1(+), 5′ RACE system version 2.0, and culture media were obtained from Invitrogen. Fetal bovine serum was purchased from HyClone Laboratories (Logan, Utah). Prime-a-Gene labeling system, Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay, RT-PCR Access kit, and plasmids pGEM-Teasy, pGL3-Basic, and pRL-SV40 were obtained from Promega (Madison, WI). Polyclonal antibodies against USF1 and USF2 were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). Hybond-P polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membranes, Rainbow molecular weight markers, ECL plus, horseradish peroxidase linked donkey anti-rabbit secondary antibody, and restriction enzymes were obtained from Amersham Biosciences. Expand High Fidelity DNA Polymerase was obtained from Roche Diagnostics (Laval, Québec, Canada). Phosphatase type VII-S was purchased from Sigma.Isolation of Bovine USF1 and USF2 cDNAs—The cloning and characterization of full-length bovine USF cDNAs required four strategies, including cDNA library screening, 5′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends (5′-RACE), a three-step nested PCR approach and genomic screening (Fig. 1). A bovine cDNA library prepared from mRNA isolated from a preovulatory follicle (41Liu J. Antaya M. Goff A.K. Boerboom D. Silversides D.W. Lussier J.G. Sirois J. Biol. Reprod. 2001; 64: 983-991Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) was initially screened with human USF1 (18Gregor P.D. Sawadogo M. Roeder R.G. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 1730-1740Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar) and mouse USF2 (25Luo X. Sawadogo M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1367-1375Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar) cDNA probes labeled with [α-32P]dCTP using the Prime-a-Gene labeling system (Promega). Positive clones were purified, and pBluescript phagemids containing cloned DNA inserts were excised in vivo with the Ex-Assist/SOLR system (Stratagene). DNA sequencing was performed commercially (Université Laval, Québec, Canada), and revealed that the longest USF1 clone was lacking sequences corresponding to the first 31 amino acid residues (93 bp; Fig. 1A, a) of human USF1, whereas the longest USF2 clone was missing the region corresponding to the first 175 amino acid residues (525 bp; Fig. 1B, a) of human USF2.Attempts to obtain the missing 5′-coding region of bovine USF1 by 5′-RACE were unsuccessful. The 93-bp region was characterized through partial sequencing of an overlapping genomic fragment isolated by genomic library screening with a bovine USF1 cDNA probe, as described (38Liu J. Antaya M. Boerboom D. Lussier J.G. Silversides D.W. Sirois J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35037-35045Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1A, b). The full-length USF1 coding region was isolated by RT-PCR using 0.5 μg of preovulatory follicle RNA and sense primer 1 and antisense primer 2 (Fig. 1A, c).To obtain additional sequences at the 5′-end of bovine USF2, the 5′-RACE system version 2.0 (Invitrogen) was used according to the manufacturer's instructions. Reverse transcription was performed as directed using antisense primer 13 (Fig. 1B, b and C) and 5 μg of RNA from a preovulatory follicle. The first 5′-RACE/PCR reaction was performed with sense abridged anchor primer 14 (Invitrogen) and antisense primer 15, whereas the second 5′-RACE/PCR reaction employed the sense abridged universal amplification primer 16 (Invitrogen) and antisense primer 17 (Fig. 1B, b and C). PCR reactions consisted of 35 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 56 °C for 60 s, and 72 °C for 1 min, and products were subcloned into pGEM-Teasy. This approach provided only 157 bp of new 5′-USF2 sequences (Fig. 1B, b). To provide more upstream USF2 cDNA sequences, a three-step nested PCR approach was performed under conditions previously described (42Filion F. Bouchard N. Goff A.K. Lussier J.G. Sirois J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 34323-34330Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), using the bovine follicular cDNA library (41Liu J. Antaya M. Goff A.K. Boerboom D. Silversides D.W. Lussier J.G. Sirois J. Biol. Reprod. 2001; 64: 983-991Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), two sense primers specific for sequences located near the multiple cloning site of the pBluescript vector (primers 18 and 19) and three antisense primers derived from bovine USF2 (primers 13, 20 and 21; Fig. 1B, c and C). The first PCR amplification employed sense primer 18 and antisense primer 13, whereas the second and third PCR used primer pairs 19 and 20, and 19 and 21, respectively. The product of the third PCR was subcloned into pGEM-Teasy, sequenced and shown to miss only the first 18 bp of the USF2 open reading frame (ORF) (Fig. 1B, c). The complete USF2 coding region was isolated by RT-PCR using 0.5 μg of preovulatory follicle RNA and sense primer 7 (designed from the highly conserved 5′-end of human and mouse USF2 ORF) and antisense primer 8 (Fig. 1B, d).Bovine USF1 and USF2 cDNA and PGHS-2 Promoter Constructs— Expression constructs containing full-length USFs, referred to as wild type USF1 (U1wt) and USF2 (U2wt), were produced by subcloning into pcDNA 3.1(+) (Invitrogen). Constructs expressing N terminus truncated forms of USF1 were produced by PCR using U1wt as template and sense primers 3, 4, or 5 and common antisense primer 2 to generate mutants lacking residues 1-57 (U1Δ1-57), 1-129 (U1Δ1-129), or 1-186 (U1Δ1-186), whereas a C terminus-truncated USF1 lacking residues 249-310 (U1Δ249-310) was produced with sense primer 1 and antisense primer 6 (Fig. 1A, c). Constructs expressing N terminus truncated forms of USF2 were produced by PCR using U2wt as template and sense primers 9, 10, or 11 and common antisense primer 8 to generate mutants lacking residues 1-149 (U2Δ1-149), 1-182 (U2Δ1-182), or 1-220 (U2Δ1-220), whereas C terminus truncated USF2 lacking residues 299-346 (U1Δ299-346) was produced with sense primer 7 and antisense primer 12 (Fig. 1B, e). All constructs were sequenced to confirm their identity.The production of bovine PGHS-2 promoter-firefly luciferase chimeric constructs, -149/-2PGHS-2.LUC and -149/-2PGHS-2ΔE-box. LUC, has been previously described (38Liu J. Antaya M. Boerboom D. Lussier J.G. Silversides D.W. Sirois J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35037-35045Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The -149/-2PGHS-2.LUC was produced by subcloning the PGHS-2 promoter fragment -149/-2 (where +1 = transcription start site) upstream of the firefly luciferase reporter gene in the vector pGL3.Basic (Promega), whereas the -149/-2PGHS-2ΔE-box.LUC construct was designed to contain a mutated E-box element in the context of the -149/-2PGHS-2 promoter fragment (38Liu J.

Antaya M. Boerboom D. Lussier J.G. Silversides D.W. Sirois J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35037-35045Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were seeded in 24-well plates at a density of 1-2 × 105 cells/0.5 ml of minimal essential medium (MEM) supplemented with l-glutamine, non-essential amino acids, 2% fetal bovine serum, insulin (1 μg/ml), transferrin (5 μg/ml), and penicillin (100 units/ml)/streptomycin (100 μg/ml), and incubated at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2. Cultures were transiently transfected with 90 fmol/well of -149/-2PGHS.LUC or -149/-2PGHS-2ΔE-box.LUC in the absence or presence of various USF expression constructs (1-50 fmol/well) using 2 μg of LipofectAMINE PLUS (Invitrogen) in 0.3 ml of MEM, in accordance with the manufacturer's protocol. Co-transfection with the SV40 Renilla luciferase control vector (pRL.SV40; Promega) was performed to normalize results. Three hours after transfection, cells were incubated in fresh culture media for 36 h in the absence or presence of forskolin (10 μm). At the end of the culture period, cell lysates were prepared, and firefly and Renilla luciferase activities were determined using Promega's Dual Luciferase Assay System and a Lumat LB 9507 luminometer (Berthold Technologies).Cell Extracts and Immunoblot Analysis—Cell extracts were prepared as described (12Sirois J. Endocrinology. 1994; 135: 841-848Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar), and protein concentrations were determined by the method of Bradford (43Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (213347) Google Scholar) (Bio-Rad Protein Assay). Samples (25-50 μg of proteins) were resolved by one-dimensional SDS-PAGE, and electrophoretically transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (38Liu J. Antaya M. Boerboom D. Lussier J.G.

Briefly, extracts of nuclear proteins (0.5 μg/reaction) were incubated with 40,000 cpm of end-labeled -149/-2 PGHS-2 promoter fragment and 1 μg of poly(dI/dC) (Amersham Biosciences) in a final volume of 20 μl of binding buffer containing 15 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 1 mm EDTA, 100 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2,5mm dithiothreitol, and 12% (v/v) glycerol. In some experiments aimed at studying the effect of protein dephosphorylation on binding activity, extracts were preincubated for 10 min with phosphatase type VII-S (0.5-1 IU; Sigma) prior to the addition of other reagents. When antibodies were used in supershift EMSAs, the nuclear extract was first incubated for 20 min with the antiserum prior to the addition of other reagents. Binding complexes were resolved by 5% acrylamide, 0.5× TBE gel electrophoresis.RNA Extraction and RT-PCR Analysis—Total RNA was extracted from granulosa cells cultured under various experimental conditions using TRIzol (Invitrogen). The Access RT-PCR System (Promega) was used to characterize expression of PGHS-2 and GAPDH transcripts. Reactions were performed with sense and antisense primers specific for PGHS-2 (5′-CACAGTGCACTACATACTTACCC-3′ and 5′-GTCTGGAACAACTGCTCATC GC-3′; generates a 735-bp fragment) and GAPDH (5′-TGTTCCAGTATGATCCACCC-3′ and 5′-TCCACCACCCTGTTGCTGTA-3′; 850-bp fragment). Each reaction was performed using 100 ng of total RNA, and cycling conditions were one cycle of 48 °C for 45 min and 94 °C for 2 min, followed by 35 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 59 °C for 1 min and 68 °C for 2 min. Following PCR amplification, samples were electrophoresed on 1% Tris acetate/EDTA-agarose gels.Statistical Analyses—One-way ANOVA was used to test the effect of different treatments and constructs on reporter gene activity. When ANOVAs indicated significant differences (p < 0.05), Dunnett's test was used for multiple comparisons of means. Statistical analyses were performed using JMP software (SAS Institute, Inc., Carry, NC).RESULTSCharacterization of Bovine USF1 and USF2—The isolated bovine USF1 cDNA was composed of an ORF of 933 bp (including the stop codon) and a 3′-untranslated region of 301 bp (Fig. 2A). Its coding region encodes a 310-amino acid protein, which is identical in length to other known mammalian USF1 proteins (18Gregor P.D. Sawadogo M. Roeder R.G.

https://openalex.org/W1968263808,"Abstract Amphiphysins are SH3 domain-containing proteins thought to function in clathrin-mediated endocytosis. To investigate the potential role of amphiphysin II in cellular trafficking of G protein-coupled somatostatin (SRIF) receptors, we generated an AtT-20 cell line stably overexpressing amphiphysin IIb, a splice variant that does not bind clathrin. Endocytosis of 125I-[d-Trp8]SRIF was not affected by amphiphysin IIb overexpression. However, the maximal binding capacity (Bmax) of the ligand on intact cells was significantly lower in amphiphysin IIb overexpressing than in non-transfected cells. This difference was no longer apparent when the experiments were performed on crude cell homogenates, suggesting that amphiphysin IIb overexpression interferes with SRIF receptor targeting to the cell surface and not with receptor synthesis. Accordingly, immunofluorescence experiments demonstrated that, in amphiphysin overexpressing cells, sst2A and sst5 receptors were segregated in a juxtanuclear compartment identified as the trans-Golgi network. Amphiphysin IIb overexpression had no effect on corticotrophin-releasing factor 41-stimulated adrenocorticotropic hormone secretion, suggesting that it is not involved in the regulated secretory pathway. Taken together, these results suggest that amphiphysin II is not necessary for SRIF receptor endocytosis but is critical for its constitutive targeting to the plasma membrane. Therefore, amphiphysin IIb may be an important component of the constitutive secretory pathway."

Two post-polyketide methylations take place during mithramycin biosynthesis. One of these methylations has been shown to be very relevant for biological activity, that is the introduction of a methyl group at aromatic C-7. We have purified to 282- fold the MtmMII methyltransferase involved in this reaction. The protein is a monomer, and results from kinetic studies were consistent with a model for the enzyme acting via a compulsory order mechanism. The enzyme showed high substrate specificity and was unable to operate on structurally closely related molecules. Structural predictions suggest that the molecule is integrated by two domains, an essentially all α-amino domain and an α/β-carboxyl domain displaying a variation of a Rossmann-fold containing the cofactor binding site. Although 7-demethyl-mithramycin did not show any biological activity, it was able to reach the nucleus of eukaryotic cells, with subsequent binding to DNA. Mithramycin and 7-demethylmithramycin were able to form similar complexes with Mg2+, although their respective DNA binding isotherms were very different. The dinucleotide binding model fit well the isotherms recorded for both compounds, predicting that the C-7 methyl group was essential for high affinity binding to specific GC and CG sequences. Considering previous structural studies, we propose that this effect is performed by positioning the group in the floor of the minor groove, allowing the interaction with the third sugar moiety of the trisaccharide, d-mycarose, which is involved in sequence selectivity.

Polyketides comprise a family of compounds synthesized via linear poly-β-ketones by repetitive head-to-tail additions of acyl units. These compounds may undergo a variety of further reactions, including cyclizations, methylations, hydroxylations, glycosylations, oxidations, and reductions. The result is an extremely diverse family of natural products, many of which display useful biological activities with clinical (antibiotics, antifungal, antitumor drugs, antiparasitic, and immunosuppressive agents) or agricultural (insecticides, herbicides) applications. The aureolic acid group of antitumor drugs comprise mithramycin (MTM), 1The abbreviations used are: MTM, mithramycin; MtmMII, mithramycin methyltransferase; PMA3, premithramycin A3; 9-DMPA3, 9-demethyl-premithramycin A3; 7-DMTM, 7-demethyl-mithramycin; PMA1, premithramycin A1; PMC, premithramycinone; AdoMet, S-adenosylmethionine; SAH, S-adenosylhomocysteine; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; TSB, Tripticasein soy broth; DTT, dithiothreitol; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid. chromomycins, olivomycins, chromocyclomycin, durhamycin, and UCH9 (1Rohr J. Méndez C. Salas J.A. Bioorg. Chem. 1998; 27: 41-54Crossref Scopus (59) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). All of these compounds belong to the large and important family of aromatic polyketides. Their structures consist of a tricyclic chromophore that is glycosylated at two different positions of the aglycon with saccharides of various chain lengths (1Rohr J. Méndez C. Salas J.A. Bioorg. Chem. 1998; 27: 41-54Crossref Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The only exception is chromocyclomycin, which possesses a tetracyclic chromophore. The polyketide aglycon of these compounds is derived from the condensation of ten acetates in a series of reactions catalyzed by a type II polyketide synthase (2Lombó F. Blanco G. Fernández E. Méndez C. Salas J.A. Gene (Amst.). 1996; 172: 87-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). These compounds are active against Gram-positive bacteria but not against Gram-negative because of a permeability barrier. While these compounds are too toxic to be used as antibiotics, they show good antitumor activity and some of them are in clinical use. They interact with GC-rich regions of DNA in a non-intercalative way in the presence of Mg2+ ions, which are essential for activity, forming 2:1 antibiotic-Mg2+ complexes and inhibiting replication and transcription (3Sastry M. Patel D.J. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 6588-6604Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). MTM is produced by Streptomyces argillaceus as well as other streptomycetes. It has been clinically used for the treatment of testicular carcinoma, Paget's bone disease, and other bone growth disorders and is also used for control of hypercalcemia in patients with malignant disease (4Dewick P.M. Medicinal Natural Products: A Biosynthetic Approach. John Wiley & Sons, Chichester, NY1997: 85Google Scholar).

Although MTM is a tricyclic aromatic polyketide with a side chain, its biosynthesis proceeds through tetracyclic tetracycline-like intermediates (6Rohr J. Weiβbach U. Beninga C. Künzel E. Siems K. Bindseil K. Prado L. Lombó F. Braña A.F. Méndez C. Salas J.A. Chem. Commun. 1998; : 437-438Crossref Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The MTM polyketide skeleton derives from one acetyl-CoA and nine malonyl-CoA units and, through condensation reactions, gives rise to a decaketide (5Blanco G. Fu H. Méndez C. Khosla C. Salas J.A. Chem. Biol. 1996; 3: 193-196Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). This molecule is a substrate for several aromatizations and cyclizations to produce 4-demethyl-premithramycinone (the first biosynthetic intermediate so far isolated) and, after an O-methylation step, it renders premithramycinone (2Lombó F. Blanco G. Fernández E. Méndez C. Salas J.A. Gene (Amst.). 1996; 172: 87-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 6Rohr J. Weiβbach U. Beninga C. Künzel E. Siems K. Bindseil K. Prado L. Lombó F. Braña A.F. Méndez C. Salas J.A. Chem. Commun. 1998; : 437-438Crossref Scopus (30) Google Scholar). This tetracyclic intermediate is then glycosylated through a series of biosynthetic intermediates with the addition of d-olivose, d-oliose, and d-mycarose sugar moieties finally making a trisaccharide chain, and generating 9-demethyl-premithramycin A3 (9-DMPA3). This intermediate is then C-methylated to premithramycin A3 (PMA3) (11Fernández Lozano Ma J. Remsing L.L. Quirós L.M. Braña A.F. Fernández E. Sánchez C. Méndez C. Rohr J. Salas J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 3065-3074Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) prior to the addition of a disaccharide of d-olivose-d-olivose to form premithramycin B (9Prado L.

All of these biosynthetic intermediates have been isolated from mutants blocked at different steps in biosynthesis and share a common feature, which is the presence of a tetracyclic aglycon. The final tricyclic structure of MTM is obtained after the oxidative cleavage of the fourth ring of premithramycin B, in a reaction catalyzed by a monooxygenase and followed by the ketoreduction of the 4′-position of the generated aliphatic chain (9Prado L.

Quirós L.M. Braña A.F. Salas J.A. J. Bacteriol. 2003; 185: 3962-3965Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). This renders the fully biologically active compound. None of the other biosynthetic intermediates obtained by insertional inactivation shows any biological activity. One outstanding case is 7-DMTM, a product accumulated by a mutant lacking the mtmMII methyltransferase gene, whose structure resembles that of MTM, varying only in the absence of the C-7 methyl group (11Fernández Lozano Ma J. Remsing L.L. Quirós L.M. Braña A.F. Fernández E. Sánchez C. Méndez C. Rohr J. Salas J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 3065-3074Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Interestingly, 7-DMTM displays no activity over several tumoral cell lines (13Rohr, J., Remsing, L. L., Salas, J. A., Méndez, C., Braña, A., and González A. M. (2002) Provisional Patent Application No. P200032Google Scholar). Biological methylations have been found to play a crucial role in drug metabolism and biosynthesis. In secondary metabolic pathways, S-adenosyl-methionine (AdoMet) is commonly utilized as a ubiquitous methyl donor, while folate-dependent methylations are mainly found in primary metabolism in different organisms, including mammals (14Zhou Z.S. Zhao G. Wan W. Zhen H. Ming G. Reiner J. Frontiers of Biotechnology & Pharmaceuticals. 2. Science Press, New York2001: 199-217Google Scholar). Substrates of AdoMet-dependent methyltransferases include lipids, proteins, polynucleotides, polysaccharides, and small molecules as polyketides. The methylated functional groups include carboxyl, phenol, and hydroxyl groups (oxygen atoms), aliphatic and aromatic amines (nitrogen atoms), thiols and sulfides (sulfur atoms), olefins and ring carbons (carbon atoms), halides and metal ions (14Zhou Z.S. Zhao G. Wan W. Zhen H. Ming G. Reiner J. Frontiers of Biotechnology & Pharmaceuticals. 2. Science Press, New York2001: 199-217Google Scholar). The structure of MTM contains nine methyl groups. Six of them are part of the sugar moieties, because each deoxysugar unit contains a C-6 methyl group derived from the dehydration step affecting C-4 and C-6 during its biosynthesis; another methyl side chain is attached at C-3 of the d-mycarose moiety, the third sugar of the trisaccharide chain. The remaining three methyl groups are part of the aglycon: C-5′ is derived from the acetate starter unit, mean-while methyl groups at C-1′ and C-7 are transferred by methyltransferases coded by the mtmMI and mtmMII genes, respectively (11Fernández Lozano Ma J. Remsing L.L. Quirós L.M. Braña A.F. Fernández E. Sánchez C. Méndez C. Rohr J. Salas J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 3065-3074Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). In this report, we have purified the MtmMII methyltransferase and characterized the methylation step occurring at the aromatic C-9 of the aglycon of 9-DMPA3. A conformational model for the protein based on structural predictions is also presented. Finally, we analyze the relevance of the methylation to the biological activity of the drug and propose a model to explain drug-DNA interaction and its structural basis. Reagents—Phenyl Sepharose High Performance, Sephacryl S-200 HR, Superdex 200, and S-adenosyl-l-[methyl-3H]methionine (specific activity 2.92 TBq/mmol) were purchased from Amersham Biosciences. DTT and alkaline phosphatase were from Roche Diagnostics Gmh. Ethylene glycol, octanol, olivomycin, AdoMet, and SAH were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Acrylamide and bisacrylamide were from Bio-Rad, EDTA and ammonium sulfate from Merck, and Tris from USB. Calf thymus DNA was purchased from Fluka & Riedel; phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) from Oxoid and Daunorubicin from Farmitalia Carlo Erba S.A. Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and fetal calf serum were obtained from Invitrogen Life Technologies, Inc. Tripticasein soy broth (TSB) was from Oxoid. Purification Procedure—For the purification of the methyltransferase coded by the mtmMII gene, S. argillaceus ΔAH, a mithramycin overproducing strain, 2M. J. Fernández Lozano, unpublished results. was grown in 2-liter Erlenmeyer flasks containing 500 ml of TSB liquid medium in the presence of 5 μg ml-1 thiostrepton. The cultures were inoculated with 25 μl of a dense spore suspension and, after incubation for 48 h at 30 °C on an orbital shaker incubator (200 rpm), the mycelia was collected by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 10 min. The mycelial paste was washed twice with buffer A (50 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.0,1 mm EDTA, and 1 mm DTT) and then was disrupted by two passes through a French Press at a pressure of 1,500 psi. DNA was broken by ultrasound (3 pulses of 15 s each with intermittent cooling on ice water) in a MSE ultrasonic disintegrator at 150 watts and 20 kHz. Unbroken cells and debris were removed by centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 30 min. Nucleic acids were precipitated with streptomycin sulfate (1% final concentration), and the supernatant fractionated by precipitation with ammonium sulfate. Fractions precipitating between 25 and 50% saturation were recovered and extensively dialyzed against buffer A containing 1.3 m ammonium sulfate. This fraction was applied to a phenyl-Sepharose High Performance column (15-ml volume) at a flow rate of 3 ml min-1; the column was eluted using a decreasing linear gradient from 1.3 to 0 m (NH4)2SO4 in 10 column volumes, followed by 10 column volumes of buffer A and, finally, 5 volumes of buffer A containing 30% v/v ethylene glycol. Active fractions were concentrated by ammonium sulfate precipitation (80% saturation) and, after centrifugation, the precipitates were resuspended in 3 ml of buffer B (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, and 150 mm NaCl). The sample was then applied to a Sephacryl S-200 column (2.6 × 90 cm) at a flow rate of 0.3 ml min-1. Active fractions were extensively dialyzed against buffer C (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm DTT, and 20% glycerol) and then applied to an adenosine-agarose column (2 ml), previously prepared as described (15James F. Nolte K.D. Hanson A.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22344-22350Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The column was eluted at a flow rate of 0.5 ml·min-1. Elution was carried out in two steps: first, buffer C including 0.2 m NaCl is applied until no protein eluting from the column can be detected; second, the enzyme is eluted using buffer C containing 0.6 m NaCl. Enzyme Assays—Methylation reactions consisted of the following components (50-μl final volume): 1 μl of S-adenosyl-l-[methyl-3H]methionine (0.1 μCi/ml), 1 μl of the correspondent acceptor molecule (100 μm final concentration) and a variable volume of enzyme and buffer (total 50 μl) depending on the protein concentration. After incubation at 30 °C for 0.5 h, the reactions were stopped by adding one-tenth of their volume of 0.2 n HCl and extracted twice with 50 μl of ethyl acetate. After phase separation, the organic phase was recovered, the solvent evaporated, and the residue was suspended in 100 μl of methanol. After addition of scintillation mixture, the radioactivity in the samples was determined. Polyacrylamide Gel Electrophoresis and Protein Analysis—Analysis of the samples during protein purification was performed using SDS-PAGE (16Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1971; 227: 680-685Crossref Scopus (207537) Google Scholar).

Steady State Kinetics—Initial velocity assays were carried out using the radiolabeled assay as described above. The concentration of one substrate was varied while the concentration of the second substrate was held at a nonsaturating concentration. After stopping the reaction, the amount of methylated molecule was estimated. The experimental data reported here were all carried out at least in duplicate. Data were analyzed by linear and nonlinear regression using the program Statistica for Windows (Statsoft, Inc.). Measure of Isotopic Exchange Reactions Catalyzed by MtmMII—The exchange reactions between [3H]AdoMet and [3H]PMA3 were assayed by measuring the formation of [3H]PMA3 from [3H]AdoMet and 9-DMPA3. Assays were performed as described under “Steady State Kinetics,” except that the concentrations of unlabeled reactants and products were adjusted to the equilibrium conditions at the beginning of the experiment. The concentrations for the unchanged pair were 1.12 and 10 μm, and the concentrations of the changed pair were varied from 1 to 75 times the concentration of the other pair depending on the assay. After addition of enzyme, the reaction mixture was incubated at 35 °C for 20 min. A small concentration (119 nm) of S-adenosyl-l-[methyl-3H]methionine was added subsequently; samples were taken at different times, processed as described (18Quirós L.M. Salas J.A. J. Biol.

Fluorescence Microscopy—HeLa cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 100 IU·ml-1 penicillin, and 100 μg·ml-1 streptomycin in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2. For fluorescence experiments, cells were subcultured on microscope slides by incubation at 37 °C for 2 min with 0.0125% trypsin in 0.002% EDTA, followed by the addition of complete medium, washing, and resuspension in fresh medium. After growth, slides were washed with PBS, and MTM or 7-DMTM were added at 1 mm in the same buffer. After 30 min at 37 °C in 5% CO2, cells were washed with PBS and intrinsic fluorescence was observed in a Leica DMR-XA microscope using a filter L5 Blue BP 480/40 BP 527/530. Determination of Physico-chemical Parameters— MTM and 7-DMTM hydrophobicities were determined measuring their partition coefficients (KD) between water and octanol. 1-ml aliquots of both molecules (30 μm) dissolved in Tris-HCl buffer 50 mm pH 2.6 at 30 °C were extracted by addition of 1 ml of octanol followed by vigorous shaking. The final concentrations in both solvents were determined spectrophotometrically at 280 nm. For the determination of the pKa of the molecules, the compounds were dissolved at a final concentration of 30 μm in a wide range three-component buffer (acetic acid, MES, Tris), and then extracted using 1 ml of octanol. The final concentrations were measured spectrophotometrically. Graphic representation of the results gave rise to sigmoid plots from which the apparent pKa was estimated. Absorbance and Fluorescence Measurements—Absorption and fluorescence spectra were recorded with a Kontron 930 (Uvikon Instruments) spectrophotometer and a PerkinElmer LS50B luminescence spectrometer, respectively. All fluorescence measurements for MTM and 7-DMTM and their complexes with Mg2+ were carried out at an excitation wavelength of 470 nm to avoid time-dependent decrease of the fluorescence emission produced by photodegradation of the molecules (25Aich P. Dasgupta D. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 1376-1385Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), and an emission wavelength of 540 nm. No correction for optical filtering effects was made, because the absorbance of the samples did not exceed 0.05. Scattering effects were eliminated by subtraction of the values measured for control solutions. Binding Experiments—All binding experiments were carried out at 30 °C in 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.0. Formation of the complex antibiotic-Mg2+ was followed measuring fluorescence quenching induced by addition of different concentrations of MgCl2 to MTM or 7-DMTM. Samples were allowed to equilibrate over 1 h at 30 °C. To carry out binding experiments involving antibiotic-Mg2+ complexes and calf thymus DNA, the correspondent molecule (3 μm) was preincubated with Mg2+ (10 mm) to ensure the complete formation of the complex. Small aliquots of DNA were then added, and fluorescence values were taken when no further changes in the measurements were observed. During the titration, the total dilution was restricted to 5% of the initial volume, and the appropriate correction was incorporated in the calculation. Analysis of Binding Data—Results from fluorimetric titrations were evaluated by linear and nonlinear regressions using the program Statistica for Windows.

Characterization of the MtmMII C-Methyltransferase—MtmMII was purified ∼282-fold with a 19% recovery in a four-step purification procedure with a purity of more than 90%. The first stage in the purification was the fractionation of the cell-free extract by ammonium sulfate precipitation, followed by three chromatographic steps using hydrophobic interaction (phenyl-Sepharose), gel filtration (Sephacryl S-200), and affinity (adenosine-agarose) (Fig. 2, A, B, and C). A summary of the procedure is shown in Table I and Fig. 2D. The purified protein showed a molecular mass of ∼36.5 kDa as deduced from SDS-PAGE gels (Fig. 2D) and 36.1 kDa as calculated by gel filtration on a Superdex 75 column in the presence of 0.15 m NaCl at a flow rate of 0.1 ml/min (data not shown). Keeping in mind that the molecular weight deduced from the primary structure of the protein is 35529.5 (11Fernández Lozano Ma J. Remsing L.L. Quirós L.M. Braña A.F. Fernández E. Sánchez C.

Enzyme activity was shown to be unaffected by the addition of different mono or divalent cations, and was stable for at least several months when kept at -70 °C in 20% glycerol. Analysis of the optimal pH of the reaction showed the typical bell-shaped curve with an optimum at slightly alkaline pH, between 8 and 8.5.Table IPurification of the MtmMII methyltransferasePurification stepTotal proteinTotal activitySpecific activityRecoveryPurificationmgpmol min-1pmol min-1 mg of protein-1%-foldCell free extract1477,54151.31001(NH2)SO4804,61857.7611.1Pheny-Sepharose HP103,205320.5426.2Sephacryl S-2000.81,7172,146.22342Adenosine-agarose0.11,43714,37019281.7 Open table in a new tab Steady State Initial Velocity Studies—When the initial velocity was measured varying the concentration of 9-DMPA3 at different fixed concentrations of AdoMet, a set of intersecting lines was obtained by regression analysis of the data at each AdoMet concentration (Fig. 3).

Equilibrium Constant—The equilibrium constant for the MtmMII-catalyzed methylation might be expected to be pH-independent as no net production or uptake of protons occurs during the course of the reaction. The time taken to reach equilibrium was first established by measurement of the change in the concentration of PMA3 with time after addition of the enzyme to solutions similar to those described below. Reaction was always completed in less than 5 h. K was measured by fixing the ratio of [AdoMet][PMA3] at 1 and varying the ratio of [SAH]/[9-DMPA3] from 20 to 200.

We showed previously that geldanamycin inhibits maturation and transport of the epidermal growth factor receptor in addition to accelerating its degradation (Supino-Rosin, L., Yoshimura, A., Yarden, Y., Elazar, Z., and Neumann, D. (2000) J. Biol. Chem. 275, 21850-21855). Here we demonstrate that the additional activities of geldanamycin on intracellular transport and protein maturation are related to its supply source. By combining chemical separation of Streptomyces hygroscopicus var. geldanus extracts and biological screens, we show that the geldanamycin-associated effects on intracellular transport and protein maturation are not mediated by geldanamycin itself but are due to the presence of an additional component(s). Chromatography of S. hygroscopicus var. geldanus extracts on a silica-gel column allowed separation between the inhibition of intracellular trafficking and geldanamycin-mediated degradation. One fraction that was devoid of geldanamycin blocked secretion of a soluble form of the erythropoietin receptor, retarded maturation of the epidermal growth factor receptor without enhancing its degradation, and blocked anterograde transport of a temperature-sensitive mutant of the vesicular stomatitis virus G protein (VSVGtsO45) from the early Golgi cisternae. This fraction was enriched (>95%) in 17-demethylgeldanamycin. However, as synthetically derived 17-demethylgeldanamycin did not inhibit intracellular trafficking, we concluded that 17-demethylgeldanamycin is not the active component. We thus propose that a compound(s) that co-purifies with benzoquinone ansamycins inhibits intracellular transport. Taken together, our data demonstrate that the inhibitory effects on protein maturation and intracellular trafficking, previously attributed to geldanamycin, are mediated by another distinct moiety."

The role of the propeptides has been studied extensively; however, the role of the Gla domain in substrate binding is less well understood. We used kinetic and fluorescence techniques to investigate the interactions of the carboxylase with a substrate containing the propeptide and Gla domain of factor IX (FIXproGla41). In addition, we characterized the effect of the Gla domain and carboxylation on propeptide and substrate binding. For the propeptide of factor IX (proFIX18), FIXproGla41, and carboxylated FIXproGla41, the Kd values were 50, 2.5, and 19.7 nm and the koff values were 273 × 10-5,9 × 10-5, and 37 × 10-5 s-1, respectively. The koff of proFIX18 is reduced 3-fold by FLEEL and 9-fold by the Gla domain (residues 1-46) of FIX. The pre-steady state rate constants for carboxylation of FIXproGla41 was 0.02 s-1 in enzyme excess and 0.016 s-1 in substrate excess. The steady state rate in substrate excess is 4.5 × 10-4s-1. These results demonstrate the following. 1) The pre-steady state carboxylation rate constant of FIXproGla41 is significantly slower than that of FLEEL. 2) The Gla domain plays an allosteric role in substrate-enzyme interactions. 3) Carboxylation reduces the allosteric effect. 4) The similarity between the steady state carboxylation rate constant and product dissociation rate constant suggests that product release is rate-limiting. 5) The increased dissociation rate after carboxylation contributes to the release of product.

The existence of these multiple γ-carboxylglutamic acid residues allows the Gla domain to form the calcium-dependent conformation required for the activity of these vitamin K-dependent proteins (4Nelsestuen G.L.

Acta. 1998; 1376: 433-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). Under-carboxylated vitamin K-dependent proteins cannot form this calcium-dependent structure and, as a result, possess poor affinities for phospholipid surfaces, endothelial cells, or activated platelets (6Esmon C.T. Sadowski J.A. Suttie J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 4744-4748Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7Bovill E.G. Mann K.G. Adv. Exp. Med.

Chem. 1985; 260: 279-287Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Previous studies indicate that all or nearly all of the Glu residues to be carboxylated are modified during a single substrate binding event (9Stenina O. Pudota B.N. McNally B.A. Hommema E.L. Berkner K.L. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 10301-10309Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 10Morris D.P. Stevens R.D. Wright D.J. Stafford D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30491-30498Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The loss of as few as three carboxylations can markedly decrease the activities of vitamin K-dependent proteins (8Malhotra O.P. Nesheim M.E. Mann K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 279-287Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, because the most frequently used anticoagulant, warfarin, causes under-carboxylation by reducing vitamin K concentration, understanding the mechanism by which processivity yields functional enzymes is important.A tethered model has been proposed to account for how carboxylase accomplishes full carboxylation of pro-factor IX (9Stenina O. Pudota B.N. McNally B.A. Hommema E.L. Berkner K.L. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 10301-10309Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 11Stanley T.B. Wu S.M. Houben R.J. Mutucumarana V.P. Stafford D.W. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 13262-13268Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). In this hypothesis, the primary interaction between carboxylase and its substrates is mediated by a propeptide sequence of 18 amino acids. Presumably, the propeptide anchors the Gla domain of the substrate near the carboxylase active site for a time sufficient for modification of all or most of the Glu residues of the Gla domain.Several lines of evidence are consistent with the idea that full carboxylation is the result of a stochastic, processive mechanism, i.e. the degree of carboxylation is controlled by the balance between the carboxylation rate of the substrate and the dissociation rate of the product. First, bone Gla protein, whose propeptide has an extremely low affinity (Ki > 500 μm) for the carboxylase and therefore a rapid dissociation rate (12Houben R.J. Jin D. Stafford D.W. Proost P. Ebberink R.H. Vermeer C. Soute B.A. Biochem. J. 1999; 341: 265-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 13Houben R.J. Rijkers D.T. Stanley T.B. Acher F. Azerad R. Kakonen S.M. Vermeer C. Soute B.A. Biochem. J. 2002; 364: 323-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), is routinely under-carboxylated in the general population. However, diets supplemented with vitamin K, which should increase the rate of carboxylation, resulted in full carboxylation of bone Gla protein in the individuals studied (14Binkley N.C. Krueger D.C. Engelke J.A. Foley A.L. Suttie J.W. Am. J. Clin. Nutr. 2000; 72: 1523-1528Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 15Binkley N.C. Krueger D.C. Kawahara T.N. Engelke J.A. Chappell R.J. Suttie J.W. Am. J. Clin. Nutr. 2002; 76: 1055-1060Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Second, individuals with mutations in the FIX propeptide (A-10T, A-10V, and N-9K) were identified because warfarin therapy affected the activity of factor IX much more than expected (16Chu K. Wu S.M. Stanley T. Stafford D.W. High K.A. J. Clin. Investig. 1996; 98: 1619-1625Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 17Oldenburg J. Quenzel E.M. Harbrecht U. Fregin A. Kress W. Muller C.R. Hertfelder H.J. Schwaab R. Brackmann H.H. Hanfland P. Br. J. Haematol. 1997; 98: 240-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). These mutations also reduce the affinity of the propeptide for the carboxylase 10-600-fold. The extent of the warfarin effect correlates with both the affinity of the mutant propeptide for the carboxylase and the concentration of vitamin K. Finally, about 70% of factor X is uncarboxylated when expressed in cell culture. The propeptide of factor X binds tighter to the carboxylase than the propeptide of any other coagulation protein. Thus, when factor X was overexpressed in cell culture (substrate excess), we predicted that product release would be rate-limiting, and a large fraction of the factor X would be secreted having by-passed the carboxylase. We predicted that changing the propeptide to one with lower affinity (but not so low as to lead to premature dissociation) would increase the turnover rate and result in increased carboxylation. This prediction was realized as decreasing the affinity of the propeptide from ∼2.6 to ∼277 nm resulted in the percentage of fully carboxylated factor X increasing from about 32% to about 85% (18Camire R.M. Larson P.J. Stafford D.W. High K.A. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 14322-14329Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). All these examples can be explained by a balance between the rate of carboxylation and the rate of product dissociation, i.e. either reducing the rate of carboxylation or increasing the rate of dissociation would lead to increased amounts of undercarboxylated clotting proteins.In contrast to the clear role of the propeptide in carboxylation, the contribution of the Gla domain to binding has not been well defined. Price et al. (19Price P.A. Fraser J.D. Metz-Virca G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 8335-8339Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar) proposed that a conserved sequence within the Gla domains of vitamin K-dependent proteins E(XC)XX(EREXC) is important for substrate-carboxylase interaction. In a typical Gla domain, the two cysteines in this motif form a disulfide bond. In support of this hypothesis, mutating either of the two conserved cysteines in the Gla domain of protein C results in under-carboxylated protein C (20Zhang L. Castellino F.J. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 6696-6704Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Furie et al. (21Furie B.C. Ratcliffe J.V. Tward J. Jorgensen M.J. Blaszkowsky L.S. DiMichele D. Furie B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28258-28262Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), however, report that mutation of either of the equivalent cysteines in the Gla domain of prothrombin does not affect carboxylation.Both in vitro and in vivo experiments suggest that the propeptide is sufficient for carboxylation of a Glu-containing non-Gla domain substrate. Bovill et al. (7Bovill E.G. Mann K.G. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1987; 214: 17-46PubMed Google Scholar) made a substrate consisting of the propeptide of prothrombin attached to a random portion of its catalytic domain. This construct was fully carboxylated in cell culture. We joined a random sequence containing five glutamic acid residues to the propeptide of factor IX, and we examined its carboxylation in vitro. Our results indicate that the major product of the reaction was carboxylated at least four times in a processive manner (11Stanley T.B. Wu S.M. Houben R.J. Mutucumarana V.P. Stafford D.W. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 13262-13268Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The substrate was probably fully carboxylated as it has since been shown that Gla moieties are preferentially ejected during mass spectrometry (22Kelleher N.L. Zubarev R.A. Bush K. Furie B. Furie B.C. McLafferty F.W. Walsh C.T. Anal. Chem. 1999; 71: 4250-4253Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar).Although the contribution of a specific Gla domain sequence is still in question, evidence clearly suggests that substrates affect the binding of the propeptide of FIX to carboxylase, increasing its affinity about 3-fold. Presnell et al. (23Presnell S.R. Tripathy A. Lentz B.R. Jin D.Y. Stafford D.W. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 11723-11733Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) propose a working model to explain the effect of Glu residues on the carboxylase-substrate interaction. In this model, the binding energy necessary for full carboxylation of vitamin K-dependent proteins is conferred by the propeptide of the substrate; the affinity of the propeptide is in turn regulated by the occupancy of Glu at the carboxylase active site.We have demonstrated previously (24Stanley T.B. Jin D.Y. Lin P.J. Stafford D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16940-16944Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) that the propeptides of the vitamin K-dependent proteins have very different affinities for the carboxylase. However, the affinity for a propeptide-containing substrate has not been reported previously. To test the contribution of the Gla domain in the interaction of carboxylase and its substrate, we have measured the affinities of the propeptide of factor IX covalently attached to the first 41 residues of the Gla domain of factor IX (FIXproGla41). Our results show that the affinity for carboxylase increases by a factor of 20 when the propeptide is covalently attached to a Gla domain. In addition, we measured the koff of propeptide, FIXproGla41, and carboxylated FIXproGla41. We also measured the rate of carboxylation of a carboxylase-bound FIXproGla41 under conditions of excess enzyme. Our studies indicate that a linkage exists between the active site and the propeptide-binding site and that this linkage effect may be important for the processivity of carboxylase. Furthermore, the koff of a fully carboxylated substrate FIXproGla41 is about three times faster than its non-carboxylated counterpart. This difference in dissociation rate may be significant for product release.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterialsAll chemicals were reagent grade.

Fluorescein-labeled and unlabeled peptides, based on the human FIX propeptide, proFIX18, or based on human pro-factor IX sequence-18-41, FIXproGla41 (and its fully carboxylated counterpart), were chemically synthesized, purified, and verified by ion spray mass spectrometry by Chiron Mimotopes (Clayton Victoria, Australia) or by Genemed Synthesis (South San Francisco, CA). For synthesis of the fluorescein-labeled propeptides, 5(6)-carboxyfluorescein was conjugated to the amino terminus of the propeptide. All peptides were ∼95% pure as determined by mass spectrometry and high pressure liquid chromatography. Labeling of the peptide with fluorescein was found to have no significant effect on carboxylase-propeptide interaction (23Presnell S.R. Tripathy A. Lentz B.R. Jin D.Y. Stafford D.W.

Before analysis, enzymes and peptides were pre-incubated for 1 h in buffer A, containing 50 mm MOPS (pH 7.5), 500 mm NaCl, 5% glycerol, 6.3 mm dithiothreitol, 66 μm EDTA, 0.16% 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine, 0.16% CHAPS, and 0.2% bovine serum albumin. The excitation and emission wave-lengths were 490 and 525 nm, respectively. Anisotropy was measured with an OLIS modified T-format SLM spectrofluorimeter (On-Line Instruments, Bogart, GA) essentially as described (23Presnell S.R. Tripathy A. Lentz B.R. Jin D.Y. Stafford D.W.

No significant loss of carboxylase activity at 17 °C was detected within 2 h in the absence of substrate or within 24 h in the presence of saturating substrate. The fraction of bound fluorescein-labeled peptide and the Kd values were determined from anisotropy, as described previously (23Presnell S.R. Tripathy A. Lentz B.R. Jin D.Y. Stafford D.W.

Reactions were initiated by the addition of 120 μm vitamin K hydroquinone and 10 μCi of NaH14CO3 (specific activity 55 mCi/mmol). Control experiments included 800 nm proFIX18 added after the 1-h incubation to determine whether reassociation of any released partially carboxylated product occurred during the reaction. At each time interval, we removed 100 μl of the sample from the 1.5-ml reaction mixture and determined the incorporation of 14CO2 as described previously (25Morris D.P. Soute B.A. Vermeer C. Stafford D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8735-8742Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Backgrounds were determined from reactions that omitted FIXproGla41. Both [14C]alanine (93 mCi/mmol) and a 14C standard purchased from Amersham Biosciences were used to determine the molar concentration of 14CO2 incorporated into product. We also used a molar extinction coefficient of 1520 to calculate the concentration of the substrate (27Mach H. Middaugh C.R. Lewis R.V. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 200: 74-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar).For substrate excess studies, 1500 nm FIXproGla41 and 25 nm active carboxylase were pre-incubated in buffer A at 17 °C for 1 h, and the assay was performed as described above for the enzyme excess experiments. The turnover rate constant of FIXproGla41 molecule during the steady state was determined by dividing the 14CO2 incorporation rate during the post-burst, slower linear part of the curve in Fig. 2b by 305.6, the y intercept of the steady state curve in Fig. 2b. This burst size represents the concentration of 14CO2 incorporated into 25 nm FIXproGla41 in one round of reaction (10Morris D.P. Stevens R.D. Wright D.J. Stafford D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30491-30498Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The kinetic studies of FLEEL, EEL, and t-butoxycarbonyl-Glu-t-butyl ester carboxylation were performed in buffer A using 25 nm active carboxylase at 17 °C for 30 min as described previously (23Presnell S.R.

We pre-incubated 20 nm fluorescein-labeled peptide with 100 nm carboxylase in buffer A at 17 °C for 1 h to allow the mixture to come to equilibrium and then added a 200-fold excess of unlabeled peptide (4 μm) at time 0. To determine the effects of Glu-containing substrates on the dissociation rate of f-proFIX18, 4.8 mm FLEEL or 250 μm FIXGla1-46 were pre-incubated with 20 nm fluorescein-labeled peptide and 100 nm carboxylase in buffer A. We took anisotropy measurements at 20-s intervals and calculated the fraction bound of fluorescein-labeled peptide at each data point as described previously. We conducted all off-rate experiments at 17 °C and determined the rate constants as described previously (26Lin P.J. Jin D.Y. Tie J.K. Presnell S.R. Straight D.L. Stafford D.W. J. Biol.

In addition to the FDDL control, a second control included heat-inactivated carboxylase instead of active enzyme. The fluorescence intensity of carboxylase bound fluorescein-labeled proFIX18 was determined as described previously (23Presnell S.R. Tripathy A. Lentz B.R. Jin D.Y. Stafford D.W. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 11723-11733Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar).RESULTSKd Values of ProFIX18, FIXProGla41, and Fully Carboxylated FIXProGla41 for Carboxylase—The contribution of the Gla domain to the affinity of the substrate was determined by measuring the changes in anisotropy caused by adding increasing concentrations of carboxylase to fixed concentrations of f-proFIX18, f-FIXproGla41, or f-carboxylated FIXproGla41. The Kd values at 17 °C are 50.0 ± 1.7 nm for f-proFIX18, 2.5 ± 0.1 nm for f-FIXproGla41, and 19.7 ± 2.0 nm for f-carboxylated FIXproGla41 (Fig. 1).Fig. 1Determination of the affinities of fluorescently labeled proFIX18, FIXproGla41, or carboxylated FIXproGla41. The points represent samples containing varying concentrations of purified carboxylase and 10 nm proFIX18 (triangle), 10 nm FIXproGla41 (circle), or 10 nm carboxylated FIXproGla41 (squares). The concentration of peptide bound was calculated from fluorescence anisotropy changes. The Kd values were obtained by fitting the titration data to the appropriate quadratic equation. The Kd values of carboxylase for proFIX18, FIXproGla41, and carboxylated FIXproGla41 were 50 ± 1.7, 2.5 ± 0.1, and 19.7 ± 2.0 nm, respectively. The inset represents the full titration curve of proFIX18 against carboxylase.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Kinetics of FIXproGla41 Carboxylation with Enzyme in Excess of Substrate—The time course for carboxylation of FIXpro-Gla41 in the presence of excess carboxylase appears in Fig. 2a. The conditions of the experiments ensure that more than 99% of the substrate is bound to the carboxylase at the beginning of the reaction. There was no appreciable dissociation and reassociation during the reaction because control experiments that included 800 nm proFIX18, a competitive inhibitor of FIX-proGla41 carboxylation with a Kd 50 nm, added at time 0 did not significantly affect carboxylation of carboxylase-bound FIX-proGla41 (Fig. 2a). The observed carboxylation rate constant for CO2 incorporation, determined from the linear portion of the curve in Fig. 2a, is 0.020 ± 0.003 s-1. In addition, at the completion of the reaction, the amount of radioactivity incorporated corresponds to 11.5 of the 12 Glu residues being carboxylated.Kinetics of FIXproGla41 Carboxylation with Substrate Excess Over Enzyme—Fig. 2b shows that the time course of carboxylation of 1500 nm FIXproGla41 by 25 nm carboxylase consists of a burst phase followed by a long steady state rate. The burst phase represents the accumulation of enzyme-product complex during the carboxylation of the first 12 glutamic acid residues. The rate determined from the burst phase of Fig. 2b, 0.016 s-1, agrees, as it should, with the value (0.02 s-1) determined from the enzyme excess experiments Fig. 2a. The agreement of these two values testifies to their accuracy. In addition, the y intercept of the slower steady state phase is 305 nm which, when divided by the number of Gla residues modified during one round of carboxylation, 12, estimates that the concentration of active enzyme is 25.4 nm. We estimated that our enzyme concentration was 25 nm by titration with a tight binding propeptide (23Presnell S.R. Tripathy A. Lentz B.R. Jin D.Y. Stafford D.W. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 11723-11733Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Again, the agreement between these two values emphasizes the accuracy of our method for determining the concentration of active enzyme.The slower linear rate shown in Fig. 2b depicts the steady state rate of FIXproGla41 carboxylation. The steady state rate constant, 4.5 × 10-4 s-1, was determined by dividing the slope by the enzyme concentration and the number of Glu residues, 12, expected to be modified.Koff Values for f-proFIX18, f-FIXproGla41, and Carboxylated f-FIXproGla41—Because the balance between the rate of carboxylation and the rate of substrate release influences full carboxylation, we measured the dissociation rates of these peptides from carboxylase by using the same conditions that we routinely use for determining in vitro rates of carboxylation. Figs. 3 and 4 show that a single exponential decay curve satisfactorily fits the time for dissociation of a carboxylase-substrate complex, allowing us to determine the koff. The rate constants for f-proFIX18, f-FIXproGla41, and carboxylated f-FIXproGla41 are shown in Table I. It is significant that the rate of dissociation (3.7 × 10-4 s-1) is so similar to the steady state rate constant (4.5 × 10-4 s-1) measured above.Fig. 3Dissociation time course from carboxylase of f-FIXpro-Gla41 (circles) and carboxylated f-FIXproGla41 (triangles). Experiments were done at 17 °C using 20 nm f-peptide and 100 nm carboxylase as described under “Experimental Procedures.” 4 μm unlabeled peptide was used at time 0 to minimize the re-association of f-peptide to carboxylase. Rate constants were determined by fitting data to the equation for single exponential decay.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Fig. 4The effects of Glu-containing peptides on the dissociation rate of proFIX18."
https://openalex.org/W2045420237,"Abstract The redistribution of two electrons in the four redox centers of cytochrome c oxidase following photodissociation of CO from the CO-bound mixed valence species has been examined by resonance Raman spectroscopy. To account for both the kinetic data, obtained from 5 μs to 2 ms, and the equilibrium results, a model is proposed in which the electron redistribution is modulated by a protein conformation transition from a nascent P1 state to a relaxed P2 state in a time window longer than 2 ms. In this model, all six possible two-electron reduced species are considered. The high population of species with a one-electron reduced binuclear center, in which the spectrum of heme a3 is perturbed by the redox state of CuB, accounts for the significant residuals in the fitting of the kinetic data with four standard spectra derived from redox species with either zero or two electrons in the binuclear center. Under equilibrium conditions, the conformational change to the P2 state destabilizes the redox states with only one electron in the binuclear center with respect to those with either zero or two electrons. As a result, the redox equilibrium is perturbed, and the electrons are redistributed. A simulation based on the new kinetics scheme, in which the electron redistribution is modulated by the protein conformation, gives reasonable agreement with both the equilibrium and the kinetic data, demonstrating the validity of this model."
