https://openalex.org/W2092398899,"Membrane channel proteins of the aquaporin family are highly selective for permeation of specific small molecules, with absolute exclusion of ions and charged solutes and without dissipation of the electrochemical potential across the cell membrane. We report the crystal structure of the Escherichia coli glycerol facilitator (GlpF) with its primary permeant substrate glycerol at 2.2 angstrom resolution. Glycerol molecules line up in an amphipathic channel in single file. In the narrow selectivity filter of the channel the glycerol alkyl backbone is wedged against a hydrophobic corner, and successive hydroxyl groups form hydrogen bonds with a pair of acceptor, and donor atoms. Two conserved aspartic acid-proline-alanine motifs form a key interface between two gene-duplicated segments that each encode three-and-one-half membrane-spanning helices around the channel. This structure elucidates the mechanism of selective permeability for linear carbohydrates and suggests how ions and water are excluded."

Here, we report the protective efficacy of vaccine-elicited immune responses against a pathogenic SHIV-89.6P challenge in rhesus monkeys. Immune responses were elicited by DNA vaccines expressing SIVmac239 Gag and HIV-1 89.6P Env, augmented by the administration of the purified fusion protein IL-2/Ig, consisting of interleukin-2 (IL-2) and the Fc portion of immunoglobulin G (IgG), or a plasmid encoding IL-2/Ig. After SHIV-89.6P infection, sham-vaccinated monkeys developed weak CTL responses, rapid loss of CD4+ T cells, no virus-specific CD4+ T cell responses, high setpoint viral loads, significant clinical disease progression, and death in half of the animals by day 140 after challenge. In contrast, all monkeys that received the DNA vaccines augmented with IL-2/Ig were infected, but demonstrated potent secondary CTL responses, stable CD4+ T cell counts, preserved virus-specific CD4+ T cell responses, low to undetectable setpoint viral loads, and no evidence of clinical disease or mortality by day 140 after challenge."

Although this process of ecological speciation is known to have occurred over millennia or centuries, nothing is known about how quickly reproductive isolation actually evolves when new environments are first colonized. Using DNA microsatellites, population-specific natural tags, and phenotypic variation, we tested for reproductive isolation between two adjacent salmon populations of a common ancestry that colonized divergent reproductive environments (a river and a lake beach). We found evidence for the evolution of reproductive isolation after fewer than 13 generations."

A controllable decoherence is imposed on the states by passing the photons through thick, adjustable birefringent elements. When the system is subject to collective decoherence, one particular entangled state is seen to be decoherence-free, as predicted by theory. Such decoherence-free systems may have an important role for the future of quantum computation and information processing."

Experimental landslides triggered by rising pore water pressure moved at sharply contrasting rates due to small differences in initial porosity. Wet sandy soil with porosity of about 0.5 contracted during slope failure, partially liquefied, and accelerated within 1 second to speeds over 1 meter per second. The same soil with porosity of about 0.4 dilated during failure and slipped episodically at rates averaging 0.002 meter per second. Repeated slip episodes were induced by gradually rising pore water pressure and were arrested by pore dilation and attendant pore pressure decline."
https://openalex.org/W2025012159,"We present the first experimental observation of modulation instability of partially spatially incoherent light beams in non-instantaneous nonlinear media. We show that even in such a nonlinear partially coherent system (of weakly-correlated particles) patterns can form spontaneously. Incoherent MI occurs above a specific threshold that depends on the beams' coherence properties (correlation distance), and leads to a periodic train of one-dimensional (1D) filaments. At a higher value of nonlinearity, incoherent MI displays a two-dimensional (2D) instability and leads to self-ordered arrays of light spots."
https://openalex.org/W2121707672,"Natural selection on mate recognition may often contribute to speciation, resulting in reproductive character displacement. Field populations of Drosophila serrata display reproductive character displacement in cuticular hydrocarbons when sympatric with Drosophila birchii. We exposed field sympatric and allopatric populations of D. serrata to experimental sympatry with D. birchii for nine generations. Cuticular hydrocarbons of field allopatric D. serrata populations evolved to resemble the field sympatric populations, whereas field sympatric D. serrata populations remained unchanged. Our experiment indicates that natural selection on mate recognition resulted in the field pattern of reproductive character displacement."
https://openalex.org/W2007853906,"Ectodysplasin, a member of the tumor necrosis factor family, is encoded by the anhidrotic ectodermal dysplasia (EDA) gene. Mutations in EDA give rise to a clinical syndrome characterized by loss of hair, sweat glands, and teeth. EDA-A1 and EDA-A2 are two isoforms of ectodysplasin that differ only by an insertion of two amino acids. This insertion functions to determine receptor binding specificity, such that EDA-A1 binds only the receptor EDAR, whereas EDA-A2 binds only the related, but distinct, X-linked ectodysplasin-A2 receptor (XEDAR). In situ binding and organ culture studies indicate that EDA-A1 and EDA-A2 are differentially expressed and play a role in epidermal morphogenesis."

Here, we show that P. aeruginosa infection induces apoptosis of lung epithelial cells by activation of the endogenous CD95/CD95 ligand system. Deficiency of CD95 or CD95 ligand on epithelial cells prevented apoptosis of lung epithelial cells in vivo as well as in vitro. The importance of CD95/CD95 ligand-mediated lung epithelial cell apoptosis was demonstrated by the rapid development of sepsis in CD95- or CD95 ligand-deficient mice, but not in normal mice, after P. aeruginosa infection."
https://openalex.org/W1970526884,We report on imaging of three-dimensional precessional orbits of the magnetization vector in a magnetic field by means of a time-resolved vectorial Kerr experiment that measures all three components of the magnetization vector with picosecond resolution. Images of the precessional mode taken with submicrometer spatial resolution reveal that the dynamical excitation in this time regime roughly mirrors the symmetry of the underlying equilibrium spin configuration and that its propagation has a non-wavelike character. These results should form the basis for realistic models of the magnetization dynamics in a largely unexplored but technologically increasingly relevant time scale.
https://openalex.org/W2012821943,"Triplex-forming oligonucleotides (TFOs) recognize and bind to specific duplex DNA sequences and have been used extensively to modify gene function in cells. Although germ line mutations can be incorporated by means of embryonic stem cell technology, little progress has been made toward introducing mutations in somatic cells of living organisms. Here we demonstrate that TFOs can induce mutations at specific genomic sites in somatic cells of adult mice. Mutation detection was facilitated by the use of transgenic mice bearing chromosomal copies of the supF and cII reporter genes. Mice treated with a supF -targeted TFO displayed about fivefold greater mutation frequencies in the supF gene compared with mice treated with a scrambled sequence control oligomer. No mutagenesis was detected in the control gene ( cII ) with either oligonucleotide. These results demonstrate that site-specific, TFO-directed genome modification can be accomplished in intact animals."

The membrane protein complement was resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and subjected to a hierarchical approach using delayed extraction matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization mass spectrometry characterization by peptide mass fingerprinting, tandem mass spectrometry to generate sequence tags, and Edman sequencing of proteins.

Arch. Ital. Biol. 1898; 30: 60-71Google Scholar). A cell-free transport assay designed to reconstitute transport of secretory cargo through the organelle has been instrumental in uncovering a dynamic coat complex (via ARF/COPI coatomer) (2Waters M.G. Serafini T. Rothman J.E. Nature. 1991; 349: 248-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar) and a membrane fusion machinery (via NSF/SNAPs/SNAREs) (3Söllner T. Whiteheart S.W. Brunner M. Erdjument-Bromage H. Geromanos S. Tempst P. Rothman J.E. Nature. 1993; 362: 318-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (2603) Google Scholar). These constituents have been proposed to regulate cargo selection, membrane budding, vesicular formation, and membrane fusion to effect the anterograde delivery of newly synthesized secretory proteins between adjacent Golgi-flattened cisternae (4Rothman J.E. Nature. 1994; 372: 55-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (1995) Google Scholar). Although recent studies have challenged this view (5Lin C.-C. Love H.D. Gushue J.N. Bergeron J.J.M. Ostermann J. J.

Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 673-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), the relevance of the above molecular machinery to the regulation of membrane trafficking in the early secretory pathway remains unquestioned. Parallel progress in understanding membrane traffic in the synaptic terminal has been largely a consequence of a systematic analysis of the major proteins identified therein largely as a consequence of the cloning of their cDNAs. This has led to considerable insight into the mechanisms of membrane targeting, fusion, budding, and vesiculation at the synaptic terminal with several of the same proteins that were identified via the Golgi cell-free transport assay (8Sudhof T.C. Nature. 1995; 375: 645-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (1760) Google Scholar, 9Bajjalieh S.M. Scheller R.H. J. Biol.

Signal. 1999; 11: 229-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar).Recent innovations in the use of mass spectrometry to characterize proteins enable a rapid assignment of major proteins to cellular structures, bypassing the requirement for protein characterization via cDNA cloning. Hence, mass spectrometry-based protein assignments to centrosomes (11Wigge P.A. Jensen O.N. Holmes S. Souès S. Mann M. Kilmartin J.V. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 967-977Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar) and the nuclear pore (12Rout M.P. Aitchison J.D. Suprapto A. Hjertaas K. Zhao Y. Chait B.T. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 635-652Crossref PubMed Scopus (1143) Google Scholar) have led to new views on the function of these structures.Edman degradation has been used previously to identify low molecular weight integral membrane proteins of a highly purified hepatic Golgi fraction. This led to the uncovering of four distinct members of the p24 family of integral membrane proteins located largely in the cis Golgi network and probably forming an intermolecular complex (13Dominguez M. Dejgaard K. Füllekrug J. Dahan S. Fazel A. Paccaud J.P. Thomas D.Y. Bergeron J.J.M. Nilsson T. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 751-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). This approach has now been extended to the use of mass spectrometry complemented by Edman degradation to identify all bands visualized by one-dimensional SDS-PAGE1 of Golgi proteins partitioning into Triton X-114 and therefore expected to be membrane proteins (14Bordier C. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 1604-1607Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The approach unambiguously identified 81 proteins. A combination of electron microscope (EM) immunolabeling and analytical centrifugation was used to visualize the subcellular distribution of selected proteins identified by mass spectrometry and Edman sequencing. Most abundant were Golgi resident enzymes and membrane trafficking proteins including Rabs and SNAREs. A novel peripheral membrane protein of 34 kDa was uncovered by this approach and localized to the isolated Golgi apparatus by cryoimmune labeling and to whole cells by confocal immunofluorescence. By systematically defining the protein composition or proteome of each organelle of the eukaryotic cell, a functional protein map of the cell may be realized.DISCUSSIONThe elucidation of the membrane protein complement of an organelle, i.e. the Golgi complex, was attempted by organelle isolation, phase partitioning to extract the integral membrane proteins, and protein characterization from one-dimensional SDS-PAGE by Edman degradation and mass spectrometry. Although two-dimensional gels are the preferred approach for proteomics, there remains an unresolved experimental difficulty in the solubility of membrane proteins during isoelectric focusing (74Santoni V. Molloy M. Rabilloud T. Electrophoresis. 2000; 21: 1054-1070Crossref PubMed Scopus (827) Google Scholar).In the present study, the identified proteins were further characterized for their location by immunolabeling and analytical fractionation. Indeed, for the SCAMP proteins, the Golgi SNARE GS28, and the apoptosis-related protein BAP31, this study represents their first characterization by these approaches.The methodology identified 81 proteins. These represented only the most abundant membrane proteins, and further refined analysis suggests a far greater complement in this Golgi fraction. 2W. P. Blackstock and J. J. M. Bergeron, unpublished observations. Of the 81 proteins characterized, 49 were considered as integral membrane proteins on the basis of having one or more predicted transmembrane domains (Table I). In addition to the transmembrane proteins are those proteins predicted to have covalent lipid modification motifs for insertion into the membrane by lipid tails (about 12). Of all proteins identified, 45 were considered to be in whole or in part Golgi-located. These included 17 resident membrane proteins and 28 trafficking proteins. Contaminants mainly from the ER and mitochondria were readily identifiable and represented 24 proteins. In addition, 40 sequence tags representing between 10 and 40 different novel proteins were elucidated. The single full-length novel protein GPP34 identified by gene building of mammalian EST sequences (Fig. 3) revealed deduced sequence information from human to yeast. Although the full-length cDNA cloning of this gene has not been reported, the gene has already been shown to be nonessential for viability of S. cerevisiae (40Winzeler E.A. Shoemaker D.D. Astromoff A. Liang H. et al.Science. 1999; 285: 901-906Crossref PubMed Scopus (3157) Google Scholar), which does not exclude a regulatory role for GPP34 in Golgi trafficking.GPP34 revealed no targeting motifs, which might predict a Golgi localization. Comparison of its distribution between membranes and cytosol revealed it to be membrane-associated as well as cytosolic, as deduced from subcellular fractionation (data not shown). Cryosections were used to ensure maximum availability of potential antigenic epitopes to the applied antibody. By the criterion of localization of antigenicity on cryosections of the Golgi fraction, GPP34 was deduced to be Golgi-localized. Furthermore, by confocal fluorescence microscopy GPP34 was found in hippocampal neurons and fibroblasts to be concentrated in regions overlapping that of the Golgi marker MG160. The EST-derived primary sequence revealed no potential signal sequence or transmembrane domain. Hence, the protein is most likely synthesized on cytoplasmic ribosomes. Analytical subcellular fractionation revealed a distribution and median density to slightly lower densities than that of the two Golgi markers employed (galactosyl transferase and mannosidase II). Most recently, Lin et al. (5Lin C.-C. Love H.D. Gushue J.N. Bergeron J.J.M. Ostermann J. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 1457-1472Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) have identified a recycling pathway for Golgi enzymes from Golgi cisternae to the p24-containing cis Golgi compartment. The higher density tail in analytical gradients of galactosyl transferase and mannosidase II (ρ1.12–1.19) could well correspond to a compartment harboring recycling Golgi proteins, i.e. the cis Golgi network. The peripheral membrane protein GPP34 appears to be absent from this latter compartment. GPP34 antigenicity at the top of the gradient may represent protein that dissociated from Golgi membranes during centrifugation. These explanations may account for the slightly lower median density of GPP34 than that of the Golgi markers. Two other novel proteins (i.e. 25DX and GS3786) were identified by Edman degradation. These integral membrane proteins have both been cDNA-cloned; their function remains largely unknown, and their sequences appear to be restricted to mammals. No information on their cellular localization is known.The choice of Golgi fraction analyzed, i.e. the WNG fraction, was a consideration of its prior characterization (7Dominguez M. Fazel A. Dahan S. Lovell J. Hermo L. Claude A. Melançon P. Bergeron J.J.M. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 673-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). In our study, cargo was not depleted from the Golgi apparatus by agents such as cycloheximide, in order not to compromise the distribution of any membrane protein whose Golgi location may depend on cargo. Indeed, continued protein synthesis is required for the localization of membrane proteins such as BAP31 in post-ER compartments (68Annaert W.G. Becker B. Kistner U. Reth M. Jahn R. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 1397-1410Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Independently of its effect on protein synthesis, cycloheximide also affects the secretory pathway directly, and this could also affect the protein distribution in the Golgi (75Amshoff C. Jack H.M. Haas I.G. Biol. Chem. 1999; 380: 669-677Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). The problem of increased cargo in the fraction was readily accommodated because few were expected to be recovered in the detergent phase following extraction with Triton X-114. A total of 10 candidate cargo proteins were identified by Edman degradation or mass spectrometry, all of which were either amphipathic or integral membrane proteins. However, whether endosomal proteins,i.e. p76 and “similar to Emp70,” are cargo or contaminants requires further analysis.It is noteworthy that by N-terminal Edman degradation, a different cohort of integral membrane proteins was identified from that found by mass spectrometry. N-terminal Edman degradation was superior for identifying multipass integral membrane proteins. Hence, the two KDEL receptors (i.e. Elp-1a and Elp-1b) and the two EMP70 homologues were identified by N-terminal sequencing but not by mass spectrometry. Multiple transmembrane-containing proteins, such as Elp-1a, Elp-1b, p76, and “similar to EMP70,” may not be efficiently in-gel-digested, and/or the tryptic peptides may not be efficiently extracted after digestion for mass spectrometry. Indeed, none of the tryptic fragments of any of the transmembrane proteins identified by mass spectrometry (Fig. 1, right side) covered hydrophobic transmembrane domains.Implications for Membrane Trafficking ModelsThe prominence of SCAMPs was unexpected. Although they have been implicated in endocytosis and exocytosis (76Singleton D.R. Wu T.T. Castle J.D. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 2099-2107Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), no clear function is known for these tetra span membrane proteins. The localization of SCAMP1 to Golgi components predicts a role in membrane trafficking. Indeed, this is the only speculative function for this family of membrane proteins,i.e. in trans Golgi cycling compartments (76Singleton D.R. Wu T.T. Castle J.D. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 2099-2107Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Remarkably, both SCAMPs showed a different intra-Golgi distribution by electron microscopy (Fig. 6, C and D), whereas analytical fractionation (Fig. 7 A) revealed a similar distribution for both and similar to that of the Golgi marker enzyme galactosyl transferase.The Golgi complex is exquisitely sensitive to the drug brefeldin A, with the action of this drug on Golgi structure and the inhibition of secretion (77Lippincott-Schwartz J. Cole N.B. Donaldson J.G. Histochem. Cell Biol. 1998; 109: 449-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 78Klausner R.D. Donaldson J.G. Lippincott-Schwartz J. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 116: 1071-1080Crossref PubMed Scopus (1537) Google Scholar) a consequence of the interaction of brefeldin A with an ARF-GEF (50Jackson C.L. Casanova J.E. Trends Cell Biol. 2000; 10: 60-67Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar, 79Helms J.B. Rothman J.E. Nature. 1992; 360: 352-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (573) Google Scholar). Two mammalian ARF-GEFs of 200 kDa with a Sec7 domain have been characterized to date (48Mansour S.J. Herbrick J.A. Scherer S.W. Melançon P. Genomics. 1998; 54: 323-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 49Claude A. Zhao B.-P. Kuziemsky C.E. Dahan S. Berger S.J. Yan J.-P. Armold A.D. Sullivan E.M. Melançon P. J.

Only one of these, GBF1 (48Mansour S.J. Herbrick J.A. Scherer S.W. Melançon P. Genomics. 1998; 54: 323-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), was identified here as partitioning into Triton X-114. Whether the other (BIG1) is also present requires further evaluation. Interestingly, the majority of GBF1 was localized to elements apposed to either side of the stacked Golgi cisternae (Fig. 6). Previous EM studies have shown a cis Golgi location in flattened cisternae by cryosectioning of intact liver (49Claude A. Zhao B.-P. Kuziemsky C.E. Dahan S. Berger S.J. Yan J.-P. Armold A.D. Sullivan E.M. Melançon P. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 71-84Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Efforts at more precisely localizing GBF1 within the Golgi complex are underway. Also found in domains apposed to one pole of the Golgi stack was α2p24, a membrane protein previously identified in the cis Golgi network and involved in ER to Golgi recycling mechanisms and in COPI binding (5Lin C.-C. Love H.D. Gushue J.N. Bergeron J.J.M. Ostermann J. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 1457-1472Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 13Dominguez M. Dejgaard K. Füllekrug J. Dahan S. Fazel A.

Bergeron J.J.M. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 285-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The limited number of SNAREs, single ARF-GEF partitioning into Triton X-114, and recycling membrane proteins from the Golgi to ER (two Elps, p58, p24 family members) as prominent constituents are unexpected. Indeed, the coincident distribuition of the apoptosis-related protein BAP31 (69Ng F.W. Nguyen M. Kwan T. Branton P.E. Nicholson D.W. Cromlish J.A. Shore G.C. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 327-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar) with the cis Golgi marker α2p24 implicates the former in an ER to Golgi recycling pathway. Characterization of the full-length sequences corresponding to the 40 sequence tags with no corresponding sequences yet found in current data bases may extend considerably the molecular machineries regulating the function of the Golgi complex in vivo. The molecular mechanisms by which newly synthesized secretory cargo is transported across the Golgi complex have remained elusive since the discovery of the organelle (1Golgi C. Arch. Ital.

Edman degradation has been used previously to identify low molecular weight integral membrane proteins of a highly purified hepatic Golgi fraction. This led to the uncovering of four distinct members of the p24 family of integral membrane proteins located largely in the cis Golgi network and probably forming an intermolecular complex (13Dominguez M. Dejgaard K. Füllekrug J. Dahan S. Fazel A. Paccaud J.P. Thomas D.Y. Bergeron J.J.M. Nilsson T. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 751-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). This approach has now been extended to the use of mass spectrometry complemented by Edman degradation to identify all bands visualized by one-dimensional SDS-PAGE1 of Golgi proteins partitioning into Triton X-114 and therefore expected to be membrane proteins (14Bordier C. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 1604-1607Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The approach unambiguously identified 81 proteins. A combination of electron microscope (EM) immunolabeling and analytical centrifugation was used to visualize the subcellular distribution of selected proteins identified by mass spectrometry and Edman sequencing. Most abundant were Golgi resident enzymes and membrane trafficking proteins including Rabs and SNAREs. A novel peripheral membrane protein of 34 kDa was uncovered by this approach and localized to the isolated Golgi apparatus by cryoimmune labeling and to whole cells by confocal immunofluorescence. By systematically defining the protein composition or proteome of each organelle of the eukaryotic cell, a functional protein map of the cell may be realized. DISCUSSIONThe elucidation of the membrane protein complement of an organelle, i.e. the Golgi complex, was attempted by organelle isolation, phase partitioning to extract the integral membrane proteins, and protein characterization from one-dimensional SDS-PAGE by Edman degradation and mass spectrometry. Although two-dimensional gels are the preferred approach for proteomics, there remains an unresolved experimental difficulty in the solubility of membrane proteins during isoelectric focusing (74Santoni V. Molloy M. Rabilloud T. Electrophoresis. 2000; 21: 1054-1070Crossref PubMed Scopus (827) Google Scholar).In the present study, the identified proteins were further characterized for their location by immunolabeling and analytical fractionation. Indeed, for the SCAMP proteins, the Golgi SNARE GS28, and the apoptosis-related protein BAP31, this study represents their first characterization by these approaches.The methodology identified 81 proteins. These represented only the most abundant membrane proteins, and further refined analysis suggests a far greater complement in this Golgi fraction. 2W. P. Blackstock and J. J. M. Bergeron, unpublished observations. Of the 81 proteins characterized, 49 were considered as integral membrane proteins on the basis of having one or more predicted transmembrane domains (Table I). In addition to the transmembrane proteins are those proteins predicted to have covalent lipid modification motifs for insertion into the membrane by lipid tails (about 12). Of all proteins identified, 45 were considered to be in whole or in part Golgi-located. These included 17 resident membrane proteins and 28 trafficking proteins. Contaminants mainly from the ER and mitochondria were readily identifiable and represented 24 proteins. In addition, 40 sequence tags representing between 10 and 40 different novel proteins were elucidated. The single full-length novel protein GPP34 identified by gene building of mammalian EST sequences (Fig. 3) revealed deduced sequence information from human to yeast. Although the full-length cDNA cloning of this gene has not been reported, the gene has already been shown to be nonessential for viability of S. cerevisiae (40Winzeler E.A. Shoemaker D.D. Astromoff A. Liang H. et al.Science. 1999; 285: 901-906Crossref PubMed Scopus (3157) Google Scholar), which does not exclude a regulatory role for GPP34 in Golgi trafficking.GPP34 revealed no targeting motifs, which might predict a Golgi localization. Comparison of its distribution between membranes and cytosol revealed it to be membrane-associated as well as cytosolic, as deduced from subcellular fractionation (data not shown). Cryosections were used to ensure maximum availability of potential antigenic epitopes to the applied antibody. By the criterion of localization of antigenicity on cryosections of the Golgi fraction, GPP34 was deduced to be Golgi-localized. Furthermore, by confocal fluorescence microscopy GPP34 was found in hippocampal neurons and fibroblasts to be concentrated in regions overlapping that of the Golgi marker MG160. The EST-derived primary sequence revealed no potential signal sequence or transmembrane domain. Hence, the protein is most likely synthesized on cytoplasmic ribosomes. Analytical subcellular fractionation revealed a distribution and median density to slightly lower densities than that of the two Golgi markers employed (galactosyl transferase and mannosidase II). Most recently, Lin et al. (5Lin C.-C. Love H.D. Gushue J.N. Bergeron J.J.M. Ostermann J. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 1457-1472Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) have identified a recycling pathway for Golgi enzymes from Golgi cisternae to the p24-containing cis Golgi compartment. The higher density tail in analytical gradients of galactosyl transferase and mannosidase II (ρ1.12–1.19) could well correspond to a compartment harboring recycling Golgi proteins, i.e. the cis Golgi network. The peripheral membrane protein GPP34 appears to be absent from this latter compartment. GPP34 antigenicity at the top of the gradient may represent protein that dissociated from Golgi membranes during centrifugation. These explanations may account for the slightly lower median density of GPP34 than that of the Golgi markers. Two other novel proteins (i.e. 25DX and GS3786) were identified by Edman degradation. These integral membrane proteins have both been cDNA-cloned; their function remains largely unknown, and their sequences appear to be restricted to mammals. No information on their cellular localization is known.The choice of Golgi fraction analyzed, i.e. the WNG fraction, was a consideration of its prior characterization (7Dominguez M. Fazel A. Dahan S. Lovell J. Hermo L. Claude A. Melançon P. Bergeron J.J.M. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 673-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). In our study, cargo was not depleted from the Golgi apparatus by agents such as cycloheximide, in order not to compromise the distribution of any membrane protein whose Golgi location may depend on cargo. Indeed, continued protein synthesis is required for the localization of membrane proteins such as BAP31 in post-ER compartments (68Annaert W.G. Becker B. Kistner U. Reth M. Jahn R. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 1397-1410Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Independently of its effect on protein synthesis, cycloheximide also affects the secretory pathway directly, and this could also affect the protein distribution in the Golgi (75Amshoff C. Jack H.M. Haas I.G. Biol. Chem. 1999; 380: 669-677Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). The problem of increased cargo in the fraction was readily accommodated because few were expected to be recovered in the detergent phase following extraction with Triton X-114. A total"

Pores in the epidermis, called stomata, allow atmospheric CO2 to enter the plant for photosynthesis. By providing an access to the outer atmosphere, they also allow transpiration, i.e. controlled diffusion of H2O vapor from the plant into the atmosphere, which is a driving force for the ascent of crude sap from the roots to the shoots. Regulation of the stomatal aperture allows the plant to tune and optimize uptake of CO2 and transpiration under diverse environmental conditions. Stomatal movements result from changes in turgor of the two guard cells surrounding the pore, an increase in turgor resulting in increased opening of the stomatal pore. The changes in turgor involve ion transport from and into the guard cells through K+ and anion channels. These channels are the targets of complex transduction pathways that allow the plant to regulate stomatal opening (1MacRobbie E.A.C. Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 1998; 353: 1475-1488Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). In this context, the molecular identification of guard cell ion channels was an early challenge when plant channels began to be cloned. By chance, one of the first cloned plant K+channels, KAT1 (2Anderson J.A. Huprikar S.S. Kochian L.V. Lucas W.J. Gaber R.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 3736-3740Crossref PubMed Scopus (550) Google Scholar), was rapidly demonstrated to be endowed with functional properties compatible with a role in mediating K+ influx (3Schachtman D.P. Schroeder J.I. Lucas W.J. Anderson J.A. Gaber R.F. Science. 1992; 258: 1654-1658Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar) and to be expressed in guard cells (4Nakamura R.L. McKendree Jr., W.L. Hirsch R.E. Sedbrook J.C. Gaber R.F. Sussman M.R. Plant Physiol. 1995; 109: 371-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar), opening the way to molecular approaches. By expressing a KAT1 Cs+-resistant mutant channel in transgenicArabidopsis, evidence has been obtained that this channel functions as an inward channel (Kinchannel)1 in the guard cell plasma membrane and plays a role in stomatal opening (5Ichida A.M. Pei Z.M. Baizabal-Aguirre V.M. Turner K.J. Schroeder J.I. Plant Cell. 1997; 9: 1843-1857PubMed Google Scholar). Biochemical approaches have revealed that Ca2+-dependent protein kinases phosphorylate the KAT1 protein (6Li J. Lee Y.R. Assmann S.M. Plant Physiol. 1998; 116: 785-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). A homolog of the animal K+ channel regulatory β-subunits has been identified and shown to interact with KAT1 (7Tang H. Vasconcelos A.C. Berkowitz G.A. Plant Cell. 1996; 8: 1545-1553PubMed Google Scholar). On the other hand, two reports (5Ichida A.M. Pei Z.M. Baizabal-Aguirre V.M. Turner K.J. Schroeder J.I. Plant Cell. 1997; 9: 1843-1857PubMed Google Scholar, 8Brüggemann L. Dietrich P. Dreyer I. Hedrich R. Planta. 1999; 207: 370-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) pointed out differences in sensitivity to external pH and to the channel blocker Cs+between the current mediated by KAT1 after heterologous expression and the current in situ. Two nonexclusive hypotheses can be put forward to explain these differences. First, the differences could be due to the fact that information obtained with heterologous systems gives a distorted view of the functional properties in planta because of, for example, lack of interactions with endogenous proteins and/or artifactual interactions with host cell proteins (9Véry A.A. Bosseux C. Gaymard F. Sentenac H. Thibaud J.-B. Pfluegers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 1994; 428: 422-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 10Dreyer I. Antunes S. Hoshi T. Müller-Röber B.

Rodriguez-Navarro A. Schachtman D.P. Spalding E.P. Sentenac H. Gaber R.F. J. Exp. Bot. 1999; 50: 1073-1087Google Scholar). The second hypothesis is that another channel is expressed in guard cells and contributes per se to the inward current by forming homomeric channels and/or in interaction with KAT1 by forming heteromeric channels. We have now identified a second gene expressed in guard cells,KAT2, for which a partial cDNA had been previously cloned (12Butt A.D. Blatt M.R. Ainsworth C.C. J. Plant Physiol. 1997; 150: 652-660Crossref Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Electrophysiological characterization of KAT2 current inXenopus oocytes revealed basic properties very similar to those of the inward current in guard cells. Regarding the sensitivity to external pH and Cs+, KAT2 is more reminiscent of the guard cell Kin channels than KAT1. Like their animal counterparts, plant Shaker channels are tetrameric proteins (13Daram P. Urbach S. Gaymard F. Sentenac H. Chérel I. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3455-3463Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Here we also bring evidence that KAT1 and KAT2 polypeptides can assemble in heterotetramers. The results provide evidence that KAT2 is a major determinant of the inward K+ current through the guard cell membrane, a fact that should stimulate research on stomatal opening mechanisms and their regulation. The 5′-region of KAT2 cDNA (see Fig. 1 C; GenBankTM/EBI accession number AJ288900) was determined by RACE-PCR on poly(A)+ mRNA isolated from 14-day-old plantlet leaves. Amplified fragments corresponding to the 5′-end ofKAT2 cDNA were cloned and sequenced. The full-length KAT2 open reading frame was then isolated by reverse transcription-PCR on poly(A)+ mRNA using a primer hybridizing at the ATG codon and containing a Spe I site (5′-ACTAGTATGTTGAAGAGAAAGCACCTCAACAC-3′) and a reverse primer hybridizing at the stop codon and containing a Not I site (5′-GCGGCCGCTTAAGAGTTTTCATTGATGAGAATATACAAATG-3′). The amplified fragment (2.1 kilobases) was cloned at the Eco RV site of pBluescript and sequenced. Plants were grown in vitro in magenta boxes as described previously (14Gaymard F. Pilot G.

Total RNA extraction and Northern blotting were performed as described previously (15Lobréaux S. Massenet O. Briat J.F. Plant Mol. Biol. 1992; 19: 563-575Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Specific probes corresponding to KAT1 and KAT2 and used in Northern blot experiments were generated by PCR (cDNA fragments encoding sequences 511–587 and 524–608 of KAT1 and KAT2, respectively). Reverse transcription and PCR were performed with Superscript II (Life Technologies, Inc.) and Extra-Pol I (Eurobio), respectively, following the manufacturers' recommendations. The KAT2 promoter region was isolated from genomic DNA (ecotype Columbia) by PCR walking (16Devic M. Albert S. Delseny M. Roscoe T.J. Plant Physiol. Biochem. 1997; 35: 331-339Google Scholar) with a reverse primer introducing a unique Nco I site just upstream from the ATG codon (5′-CCATGGGGTTAGTTATAAATATAGTGATGAAACTTGTG-3′). A 1.8-kilobase fragment was isolated, cloned into pBluescript, and sequenced. The construct was digested by Bam HI andNco I and introduced into pBI320.X (from Dr. R. Derose; this plasmid bears a unique Nco I site at the initiation codon of the promoterless GUS 3′-nopaline synthase gene), leading to a translational fusion between the KAT2 promoter region and the GUS coding sequence. This construct was digested byBam HI and Sac I and introduced into the pMOG402 binary vector (from Dr. H. Hoekema). The resulting plasmid was introduced into Agrobacterium tumefaciens MP90 (17Höfgen R. Willmitzer L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 20: 9877Crossref Scopus (838) Google Scholar).Arabidopsis thaliana (ecotype Columbia) was transformed with agrobacteria using the floral dip method (18Clough S.J. Bent A.F. Plant J. 1998; 16: 735-743Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Selection of T1 seedlings was performed in vitro on the half-strength medium described by Murashige and Skoog (19Murashige T. Skoog F. Physiol. Plant. 1962; 15: 473-497Crossref Scopus (52752) Google Scholar) supplemented with 1% sucrose, 0.7% agar, and 50 μg·ml−1 kanamycin under the following conditions: 21/18 °C day/night temperature, 16-h photoperiod, and 150 microeinsteins·m−2·s−1. For GUS assay, plants were either grown in vitro on the same medium and under the same conditions as described above or grown in a greenhouse on attapulgite-peat compost (14Gaymard F. Pilot G.

GUS histochemical staining was performed as described previously (20Lagarde D. Basset M. Lepetit M. Conejero G. Gaymard F. Astruc S. Grignon C. Plant J. 1996; 9: 195-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). Cross-sections of GUS-stained material were prepared on hydroxyethyl methacrylate (Technovit 7100, Heraus-Kulzer GmBH, Wehrheim, Germany)-embedded tissues with an Amersham Pharmacia Biotech microtome and were counterstained in purple by periodic acid-Schiff staining. KAT1 and KAT2 cDNAs were introduced into the pCi plasmid (Promega) under the control of the cytomegalovirus promoter. The resulting plasmids, pCi-KAT1 and pCi-KAT2, were injected into Xenopus oocytes (purchased from Centre de Recherches de Biochimie Macromoléculaire, CNRS, Montpellier, France) using a 10–15-μm tip diameter micropipette and a pneumatic injector (10 nl of 1 μg·μl−1plasmid solution/oocyte). Control oocytes were injected with 10 nl of empty plasmid solution. Whole-cell currents were recorded as described previously (21Lacombe B. Thibaud J.-B. J. Membr. Biol. 1998; 166: 91-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) using the two-electrode voltage-clamp technique, 3–7 days after injection, on oocytes continuously perfused with bath solution (see figure legends). Quantitative analyses of macroscopic current that yielded the gating parameters given in Table I were performed as described previously (21Lacombe B. Thibaud J.-B. J. Membr.

Voltage-pulse protocol application, data acquisition, and data analyses were performed using pClamp (Axon Instruments, Inc., Foster City, CA), Winascd (Dr. G. Droogmans, University of Leuven, Leuven, Belgium), and Sigmaplot (Jandel Scientific, Erkrath, Germany) software. Plasmid vectors pGBT9 (23Bartel P.L. Fields S. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 254: 241-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar) and pACTII (kindly provided by S. Elledge, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX) were used for the generation of fusion proteins with the DNA-binding domain and the activator domain of Gal4, respectively. In-frame fusions were made with the C-terminal cytoplasmic regions from KAT1 and KAT2. For KAT1, a Nco I site was created at the end of the S6 segment coding sequence by site-directed mutagenesis (24Kunkel T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 488-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (4880) Google Scholar), the GTCGTTCATTGGACT sequence from KAT1 being replaced by GTCGTCCATGGGACT. The KAT2 insert was obtained by digestion with Bsr I and blunt-ending with mung bean nuclease, thus allowing the polypeptide sequence to be synthesized from Arg316. Yeast cell transformations and the assay for reporter gene expression (usingo-nitrophenyl-β-d-galactopyranoside as substrate) were performed as described previously (23Bartel P.L. Fields S. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 254: 241-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar, 25Gietz D. St. Jean A. Woods R.A. Schiestl R.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 1425Crossref PubMed Scopus (2863) Google Scholar). A partial KAT2 cDNA sequence has been reported (GenBankTM/EBI accession number U25694) (12Butt A.D. Blatt M.R. Ainsworth C.C. J. Plant Physiol. 1997; 150: 652-660Crossref Scopus (17) Google Scholar). A complete KAT2 cDNA (GenBankTM/EBI accession number AJ288900) was isolated by 5′-RACE, and the promoter region was isolated by PCR walking. The sequence of a bacterial artificial chromosome containing theKAT2 gene then became available (BAC T9A21; GenBankTM/EBI accession number AL021713). Comparison of the PCR-amplified fragments (KAT2 cDNA and promoter) with that of this bacterial artificial chromosome indicated that the PCR steps had introduced no mutation. Sequence analysis of the deduced KAT2 polypeptide identified the three domains exhibited by all plant Shaker-like channels (see “Discussion”) cloned up to now (Fig.1 A): from the N to C terminus, (i) the hydrophobic core with the typical six transmembrane segments (S1–S6) and the pore-forming domain (called the P domain, between S5 and S6), (ii) the putative cyclic nucleotide-binding domain, and (iii) the so-called KHA domain, rich in hydrophobic and acidic residues and thought to play a role in channel tetramerization (13Daram P. Urbach S. Gaymard F. Sentenac H. Chérel I. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3455-3463Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar) and/or channel clustering in the membrane (26Ehrhardt T. Zimmermann S. Müller-Röber B. FEBS Lett. 1997; 409: 166-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Within theArabidopsis Shaker-like family, the strongest similarities are found to KAT1. The similarities of KAT2 to KAT1 are detected all along the polypeptide (∼85% identity from the first residue to the end of the putative cyclic nucleotide-binding domain; ∼65% identity in the KHA domain), except in the region lying between the putative cyclic nucleotide-binding domain and the KHA domain (residues 509–610 in KAT1 and residues 520–639 in KAT2) (Fig. 1 A). The P domain of KAT2 differs from that of KAT1 by a single residue (Fig. 1 B), and the S4 segments (with a role in voltage sensing) are identical. Comparison of the 5′-untranslated region sequence with the sequence of the genomic clone (Fig. 1 C and BAC T9A21, respectively) revealed a typical TATA box ∼40 base pairs upstream from the first nucleotide of the KAT2 cDNA we have cloned, supporting the hypothesis that this cDNA could be full-length. The KAT2 5′-untranslated region is unusually long (at least 455 base pairs) compared with otherArabidopsis genes (27Joshi C.P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 6643-6653Crossref PubMed Scopus (676) Google Scholar). Furthermore, it contains four ATG codons defining four small upstream open reading frames (open reading frames upstream from the main one). Such features strongly suggest a role of the transcript leader in regulation of expression (28Damiani Jr., R.D. Wessler S.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8244-8248Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 29Michelet B. Lukaszewicz M. Dupriez V. Boutry M.

Northern blot experiments detectedKAT2 mRNA in aerial organs and not in roots (Fig.2 A). Reverse transcription-PCR experiments failed to detect KAT2 transcripts in roots (data not shown), indicating that expression of KAT2 is restricted to aerial organs. Localization of expression was further investigated using transgenic plants carrying the Escherichia coliβ-glucuronidase gene (GUS) under the control of theKAT2 promoter region (1.8 kilobases). Reporter gene activity was analyzed on the F1 and F2 progeny of 10 independent transgenic plants. GUS activity was never detected in roots. In developing leaves, GUS staining was present in all cells (Fig. 2 B). In mature leaves, the activity was mainly detected in guard cells and in minor veins (Fig. 2, C and D). Mature leaf cross-sections revealed that GUS staining in minor veins was present in phloem and not in xylem parenchyma (Fig. 2 E). In hypocotyls, stems (Fig. 2 F), and petioles, GUS activity was present only in guard cells. In parallel experiments on transgenicArabidopsis expressing GUS under the control of the KAT1 promoter region (stock CS3763,Arabidopsis Biological Resource Center), stem guard cells never displayed GUS staining (data not shown), in accordance with the lack of expression of the reporter gene in these cells (4Nakamura R.L. McKendree Jr., W.L. Hirsch R.E. Sedbrook J.C. Gaber R.F. Sussman M.R. Plant Physiol. 1995; 109: 371-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). The data suggest that guard cells in the stem express KAT2, but not KAT1, whereas guard cells in petioles and leaves express both channels. InXenopus oocytes injected with the pCi-KAT2 plasmid, hyperpolarization of the membrane beyond −100 mV elicited an inward current (Fig. 3) that was not recorded in control oocytes injected with empty pCi (data not shown). The exogenous macroscopic current displayed slow activation and deactivation kinetics (Fig. 3 A) with voltage-dependent time constants (Table I). No inactivation could be seen even during hyperpolarizing pulses lasting 50 s (data not shown). The steady-state current-voltage plots (Fig. 3 B) show a strong inward rectification with a threshold potential of about −100 mV irrespective of external K+ concentration. The reversal potential of the KAT2 current was determined at different external K+ concentrations. Following a change in the external K+ concentration from 10 to 100 mm, the reversal potential shifted by 57 ± 2 mV (n = 5), remaining close to the K+ equilibrium potential (Fig.3 B, inset), thus indicating that the inward current mediated by KAT2 was mainly carried by K+ ions. Determination of reversal potential under pseudo bi-ionic conditions (data not shown) allowed the determination of relative permeability ratios. KAT2 displays the following permeability sequence (Eisenman's series IV): K+ > Rb+ >≫ Na+ ≈ Li+ (Table I). Under our experimental conditions (expression level, size of patch), macroscopic KAT2 currents mimicking whole-oocyte currents could be recorded in the cell-attached patch-clamp configuration (Fig.3 C, trace c.a.). Upon patch excision, however, the KAT2 current decreased rapidly (inside-out configuration) (Fig.3 C, traces i.o.1 and i.o.2). In this configuration, unitary currents could be resolved, which are shown in Fig. 3 D. KAT2 rundown could be overcome and the initial current partly restored by cramming the patch back into the oocyte (Fig. 3 C, trace p.c.). This suggested that KAT2 required intracellular factors, available in the oocyte cytoplasm, to open. From the single-channel recordings obtained in the inside-out configuration at different potentials, we were able to determine the single-channel slope conductance of KAT2: 6.7 picosiemens in symmetrical 100 mm K+ solution (Fig.3 D), a value quite similar to that reported for KAT1 (31Hedrich R. Moran O. Conti F. Busch H. Becker D. Gambale F. Dreyer I. Küch A. Neuwinger K. Palme K. Eur. Biophys. J. 1995; 24: 107-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar,32Hoshi T. J. Gen. Physiol. 1995; 105: 309-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). As native guard cell inwardly rectifying K+ channels are known to be stimulated upon external acidification (33Brüggemann L. Dietrich P. Becker D. Dreyer I. Palme K. Hedrich R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 3298-3302Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 34Roelfsema M.R.G. Prins H.B.A. Planta. 1998; 205: 100-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), we compared the sensitivity of KAT1 and KAT2 to external pH in parallel experiments carried out on oocytes from the same batch (Fig.4). The activation potential of KAT2 was shifted positively when the pH was decreased from 7.5 to 6.0 (Fig.4 B), leading to an increase in current amplitude at a given potential. Analyses of the correspondingG/G max versus potential curves (data not shown) showed that the G maxvalue was not changed and yielded the gating parameters (Table I). Although the apparent gating charge (z g) was not changed, the half-activation potential (E a50) was indeed shifted by approximately +15 mV when the pH was decreased from 7.5 to 6.0. By contrast, and as previously reported (35Véry A.A. Gaymard F. Bosseux C. Sentenac H. Thibaud J.-B. Plant J. 1995; 7: 321-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar), KAT1 gating parameters were left unchanged by the pH drop (Fig. 4 A), an increase in macroscopic conductance (G max) being responsible for the increase in current (Table I). Block by external Cs+ is a classical feature of plant and animal K+ channels that is believed to involve the binding of Cs+ to some site within the pore. Pore penetration by Cs+ often results in some voltage dependence of the K+ channel block (36Hille B. Ionic Channels of Excitable Membranes. Sinauer Associates, Inc., Sunderland, MA1992: 272-302Google Scholar). As previously reported (9Véry A.A. Bosseux C. Gaymard F. Sentenac H. Thibaud J.-B. Pfluegers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 1994; 428: 422-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 31Hedrich R. Moran O. Conti F. Busch H. Becker D. Gambale F. Dreyer I. Küch A. Neuwinger K. Palme K. Eur. Biophys. J. 1995; 24: 107-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), addition of 0.5 mm Cs+ to the external medium resulted in a voltage-dependent block of the KAT1 current (Table I). In parallel experiments on the same batch of oocytes, addition of Cs+ resulted in a voltage-independent block of KAT2 inward currents (Fig. 5,A and B; and Table I). The inhibition constant of this block, estimated from the data shown in Fig. 5 B, is 2.5 mm. It is worth noting that the sequences of the pore domains of KAT1 and KAT2 differ by a single amino acid, Phe266 in KAT1 corresponding to Leu in KAT2 (Fig.1 B). In this context, a KAT1-F266L mutant channel (a gift from R. Hedrich, University of Würzburg, Würzburg, Germany), i.e. a KAT1 mutant with the pore sequence of KAT2, was studied. The Cs+ sensitivity of the mutant channel is clearly voltage-dependent and reminiscent of that of KAT1 (Fig. 5 C). Therefore, the pore domain sequence is not the only determinant of KAT1 and KAT2 sensitivity to Cs+. Further pharmacological characterization revealed that KAT2 has a lower sensitivity to external Ba2+than KAT1 and a sensitivity to external tetraethylammonium similar to that of KAT1 (Table I). Single-point mutations in the KAT1 P domain have been recently reported to yield dominant-negative mutants (37Baizabal-Aguirre V.M. Clemens S. Uozumi N. Schroeder J.I. J. Membr. Biol. 1999; 167: 119-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). We introduced a mutation in KAT1 (W253G) that produced electrically silent channels in Xenopus oocytes. Coexpression of this mutant with the wild-type KAT1 channel inXenopus oocytes resulted in a lower inward current than did the expression of the wild-type channel alone (Fig.6 A). Such an effect indicates that the KAT1-W253G mutant has a dominant-negative capability,i.e. that it can interact with the wild-type polypeptide, leading to formation of channels that are not functional or not targeted to the membrane. Interestingly, coexpression of the KAT1-W253G mutant with KAT2 decreased the inward current as well (Fig.6 A), providing evidence that the polypeptides encoded byKAT1 and KAT2 can interact and form heterotetrameric channels. Plant K+ channels have been shown to form tetramers through interactions involving the cytoplasmic C-terminal domain (13Daram P. Urbach S. Gaymard F. Sentenac H. Chérel I. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3455-3463Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). We therefore investigated the possibility of interactions between the C-terminal domains of KAT1 and KAT2 using the two-hybrid system in yeast (38Fields S. Song O. Nature. 1989; 340: 245-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (4799) Google Scholar) and obtained positive results (Fig. 6 B). Coexpression of the wild-type KAT1 and KAT2 polypeptides in oocytes resulted in an inward current that activated at a threshold potential between those of KAT1 and KAT2. We failed to find any typical feature of this current (i.e. a feature that would not be reminiscent of KAT1 or KAT2 properties). Interestingly, however, the current monitored in control oocytes injected with 10 ng of either KAT1 or KAT2 plasmid was significantly smaller than that monitored in oocytes coinjected with 5 ng of each plasmid, suggesting some synergy. The physiological significance of this effect cannot be assessed at the present time. However, in the animal field, similar observations due to interaction between channel subunits have been shown to play a rolein situ in the organism (39Krapivinsky G. Gordon E.A. Wickman K.

When stably transfected into the LPA-unresponsive cell line RH7777 (RatHepatoma), Edg-2 mediates inhibition of cAMP accumulation, whereas Edg-4 and Edg-7 mediate calcium mobilization (22Im D.-S.

Because only the inhibition of cAMP accumulation is pertussis toxin-sensitive, this suggests that, in this system, Edg-2 is Gi-linked, whereas Edg-4 and -7 are Gq-linked. However, in Jurkat T cells (31An S. Bleu T. Zheng Y. Goetzl E.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 1998; 54: 881-888Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar) or rat oligodendrocytes (32Moller T. Musante D.B.

Pharmacol. 1998; 54: 881-888Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar) Edg-2 mediates calcium mobilization via Gαi, while Edg-4 utilizes Gαi and Gαq. Thus, LPA receptor coupling may be dependent on the system of expression. The cloning of specific receptors for LPA represents a major advancement in the study of LPA signaling and the physiologic significance of receptor activation; however, endogenous cellular responses to LPA have not yet been mapped to specific endogenous receptors due to a lack of selective ligands. Van Corven and colleagues first described a pertussis toxin-sensitive mitogenic response to LPA in Rat 1 cells (8van Corven E.J. Groenink A. Jalink K. Eichholtz T. Moolenaar W.H. Cell. 1989; 59: 45-54Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (680) Google Scholar). In contrast to LPA's effects on calcium mobilization, cAMP accumulation, and cytoskeletal rearrangement, the mitogenic response has a half-maximal concentration in the mid-micromolar range in fibroblasts, ovarian cancer cell lines, and cultured vascular smooth muscle cells (7Tokumura A. Iimori M. Nishioka Y. Kitahara M. Sakashita M. Tanaka S. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 267: C204-C210Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8van Corven E.J. Groenink A. Jalink K. Eichholtz T. Moolenaar W.H.

This discrepancy has been suggested to reflect degradation over the long time course of the mitogenesis experiments (24 h or more) as compared with the assays for higher potency responses (seconds to minutes). LPA also has micromolar EC50 with respect to platelet aggregation, although this response is measured in an assay of only a few minutes duration and is therefore presumably not greatly affected by degradation (34Simon M.-F.

The degradation of LPA may be attributed to the activity of integral membrane enzymes lipid phosphoric acid phosphatases (LPPs) (also named type 2 phosphatidic acid phosphatases (PAP2)) (reviews: Refs. 37Brindley D.N.

Zhang Q.-X. Pilquil C. Singh I. Xu J. Dewald J. Dillon D.A. Berthaume L.G. Carman G.M. Waggoner D.W. Brindley D.N. Biochem. J. 1999; 349: 677-686Crossref Google Scholar), suggesting a potential role in the regulation of LPA signaling by degrading LPA at the cell surface. The K m for LPP-mediated hydrolysis of LPA is several orders of magnitude higher concentration than that required for most LPA-signaling responses (40Hooks S.B. Ragan S.P. Lynch K.R. FEBS Lett. 1998; 427: 188-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) (see Fig. 5 A). Therefore, it is not clear if the activity of the LPPs has a physiologically significant effect on the activity of LPA at its receptors, because LPA is maximally efficacious at concentrations well below the affinity of the phosphatases for LPA. However, the phosphatases may significantly affect LPA receptor activation despite their lower affinity, if the concentration of phosphatase is much higher than the receptor concentration. Furthermore, the high K m of the phosphatases suggests that they will exhibit first order reaction kinetics under physiologic concentrations of LPA. This study was initiated with the goal of determining the role of the phosphatases in the regulation of LPA signaling; specifically, we wanted to test the hypothesis that the markedly lower potency of LPA with respect to mitogenesis was simply a result of LPP-mediated hydrolysis. Brindley has previously reported that in one-point assays the mitogenicity of LPA is diminished in LPP1-overexpressing fibroblasts (44Jasinska R. Zhang Q.-X. Pilquil C. Singh I. Xu J. Dewald J. Dillon D.A. Berthaume L.G. Carman G.M. Waggoner D.W. Brindley D.N. Biochem. J. 1999; 349: 677-686Crossref Google Scholar). We wanted to characterize this interaction further and demonstrate that LPP1 lowers the potency of LPA by hydrolyzing the phosphoester bond and thus destroying the ligand for LPA receptors. To this end, we synthesized two LPA analogs with phosphonate head groups, which should render them resistant to hydrolysis by the LPPs. If our hypothesis is true, then the potency of the phosphonate compounds relative to LPA should be greater in mitogenic assays than in assays with a shorter incubation period. Also, increases in the activity of LPP enzymes should diminish the activity of LPA but have no effect on the potency of the phosphonates. In the course of testing this hypothesis, we discovered a striking difference in the ligand selectivity of the mitogenic response as compared with that of the three cloned LPA receptors. The mitogenic response to LPA and LPA analogs is consistent with the platelet aggregation response but inconsistent with activation of Edg-2, -4, or -7. The synthesis of the α-hydroxy and α-keto propanolamide phosphonic acids will be described in detail in a manuscript currently being prepared on a series of phosphonate compounds. 2W. L. Santos, J. A. Rossi, S. B. Hooks, K. R. Lynch, T. L. MacDonald, in preparation. Briefly, oleoyl chloride was acylated using 1-aminopropanol and pyridine followed by Dess-Martin oxidation. The resulting aldehyde was reacted with di-t-butylphosphonate in the presence of NaOH to generate the protected α-hydroxy derivative. Treatment with trifluoroacetic acid provided WLS31, whereas oxidation with pyridinium chlorochromate followed by trifluoroacetic acid deprotection provided WLS60. Plasmid DNA was transfected into HEK 293 T cells using a calcium phosphate transfection protocol (45Wigler M. Silverstein S. Lee L.S. Pellicer A. Cheng Y.C. Axel R. Cell. 1977; 11: 223-232Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (845) Google Scholar). Briefly, a DNA mixture containing 25 μg of DNA and 0.25 m CaCl was added to HEPES-buffered 2 mm Na2HPO4. Subconfluent monolayers of HEK 293 T cells were poisoned with 25 mm chloroquine, and the DNA precipitate was then applied to the cells. After 4 h, the monolayers were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and refed media (90% 1:1 Dulbecco's modified essential media (DMEM):F-12 + 10% fetal bovine serum). The cells were harvested 48–72 h after addition of the DNA by scraping in HME buffer (in mm: 20 HEPES, 5 MgCl2, 1 EDTA, pH 7.4) containing 10% sucrose on ice, and disrupted using a Dounce homogenizer. After centrifugation at 800 × g, the supernatant was diluted with HME without sucrose and centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h. The resulting pellet was rehomogenized and centrifuged a second hour at 100,000 × g. This crude membrane pellet was resuspended in HME with sucrose, aliquoted, and snap-frozen by immersion in liquid nitrogen. The membranes were stored at −70 °C. Protein concentration was determined spectroscopically by Bradford protein assay. Phosphorus-32-labeled lysophosphatidic acid was prepared by reacting monoolein (NuChek Prep) with [γ-32P]ATP in the presence of diacylglycerol kinase (Sigma) as described by Walsh et al. (46Walsh J.P. Fahrner L. Bell R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 4374-4381Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The method used here differs from the published protocol in that the reaction size was increased 10-fold, and the reaction was allowed to proceed for 18 h. The labeled products were purified by normal-phase high pressure liquid chromatography. Using a Varian Microsorb MV, 4.6 mm x 250 mm, 5-μm silica column, lipids were eluted using the following gradient profile: isocratic solvent A (HCCl3/MeOH/H2O/NH4OH: 77/21.65/.85/.5) from 0 to 5 min, linear transition from solvent A to solvent B (HCCl3/MeOH/H2O/NH4OH: 59/34.5/6/.5) from 5 to 15 min, and isocratic solvent B from 15 min onward. The collected fractions were then washed with 0.1% HCl and MeOH, and the organic phase was retained and dried. Assays for phosphatase activity were carried out according to the protocol described by Kanohet al. (42Kai M. Wada I. Imai S. Sakane F. Kanoh H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24572-24578Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar), using a constant Triton X-100:labeled lipid ratio of 50:1. The final specific activity of the lipids was adjusted to 10–50 Ci/mol. Briefly, 10 μg of membrane protein was prewarmed to 37 °C in a reaction mixture containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 1 mm EDTA, and 1 mg/ml fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin. Reactions were started by the addition of the radiolabeled lipid-Triton X-100 mixture, incubated at 37 °C for 5 min, and stopped by the addition of 100 μl of 0.1 n HCl in methanol. 200 μl of CHCl3 and 200 μl of 1m MgCl2 were then added, and the reactions were vortexed and centrifuged briefly, and a fraction of the aqueous layer was added to scintillation fluid for counting. The ectophosphatase activity of LPP-overexpressing cells was determined with an assay derived from the assay described above. HEK 293 cells were suspended (via trypsinization) in HKRB (in mm: 20 HEPES, 103 NaCl, 4.8 KCl, 0.5 CaCl2, 1.2 MgSO4, 1.2 KH2PO4, 25 NaHCO3, 15 glucose, pH 7.4) at a concentration of 106 cells/ml. LPA was added to each 50-μl reaction in 0.1% fatty acid free bovine serum albumin. The reactions were allowed to proceed for 10 min at 37 °C and stopped with the addition of acidified methanol. The reactions were spun at 12,000 × g for 5 min to remove any cell debris. The supernatant was extracted with chloroform, and the radioactivity in the aqueous phase was determined with scintillation counting. Calcium mobilization assays were performed as described previously by us (13Lynch K.R. Hopper D.W. Carlisle S.J. Catalano J.G. Zhang M. Macdonald T.L. Mol. Pharmacol. 1997; 52: 75-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Briefly, intercellular calcium fluxes were measured on cell populations (2–4 × 106 cells) that had been loaded with the calcium-sensitive fluorophore, INDO-1. Responses, which were measured in a temperature-controlled fluorimeter (Aminco SLM 8000C, SLM Instruments, Urbana, IL), are reported as the fraction of the maximal response (i.e. response to 75 μm digitonin). Calcium mobilization assays were performed in HKRB. GTPγS binding experiments were performed as described earlier (22Im D.-S. Heise C.E. Harding M.A. George S.R. O'Dowd B.F. Theodorescu D. Lynch K.R. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 57: 753-759Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Ligand-mediated GTPγS binding to G-proteins was measured in GTP binding buffer (in mm: 50 HEPES, 100 NaCl, 10 MgCl2, pH 7.5) using 25 μg of a membrane preparation from HEK 293 T cells transiently transfected with DNAs encoding Gαi2 C351F (this mutant G-protein is resistant to pertussis toxin inactivation), Gβ1, and Gγ2 along with the receptor being tested. Ligand was added to membranes in the presence of 10 μm GDP and 0.1 nm [35S]GTPγS (1200 Ci/mmol) and incubated at 30 °C for 30 min. Bound GTPγS was separated from unbound using the Brandel harvester (Gaithersburg, MD) and counted with a liquid scintillation counter. Mitogenesis was estimated by measuring DNA synthesis using a tritiated thymidine incorporation assay. Nearly (70%) confluent monolayers were grown in multiwell plates (48 and 96 wells) in DMEM-F12 (HEK 293 cells), DMEM (MDA-MB231 cells), or MEM supplemented with pyruvate and glutamine (RH7777 cells) plus 10% fetal bovine serum. Cell lines stably transfected with LPP1 or Edg receptor were grown in the appropriate media plus 800 μg/ml G418. Cells were deprived of serum for 30 h, and then treated with drug or vehicle for 22 h. 1 μCi/ml of [3H]thymidine was added 4 h before harvest. Incorporated thymidine was harvested by first fixing the cells in cold methanol, washing with phosphate-buffered saline, and precipitating DNA with cold 10% trichloroacetic acid. Precipitated material was either counted directly by adding scintillant and counting in a Packard Top counter (for 96-well plates) or solubilized with 0.2 n NaOH, 0.1% SDS, neutralized with HCl, and added to scintillant in scintillation vials for counting (for 48-well plates). Platelets were isolated from fresh human blood from donors (47Murayama T. Kajiyama Y. Nomura Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 4290-4295Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, blood was added to acid-citrate-dextrose to prevent coagulation, and centrifuged at low speed to prepare platelet-rich plasma. Indomethacin and apyrase were added to the platelet-rich plasma, and this preparation was centrifuged at high speed to sediment platelets. Platelets were resuspended in buffer (in mm: 140 NaCl, 0.34 Na2HPO4, 2.9 KCl, 10 HEPES, 12 NaHCO3, 5 glucose, 2 MgCl2) and their aggregation was measured in a Lumi-aggregometer (Chrono-Log, Havertown, PA). Prior to addition of LPA and analogs, 0.16 μm ADP was added. To examine the effect of LPP hydrolysis on LPA's potency in mitogenesis, we developed two LPP-resistant LPA analogs by mimicking the phosphate group with an α-substituted phosphonate (Fig.1). The direct carbon-to-phosphorous bond should render phosphonates resistant to degradation by the phosphatases. In fact, the α-hydroxy (wls-31) and α-keto (wls-60) phosphonates were not only resistant to LPP-mediated hydrolysis, they also acted as inhibitors of LPP activity. When added to a reaction of LPP enzyme and LPA substrate, the phosphonates significantly blocked the activity of each of the three LPP isoforms. Preincubation of the phosphonates with the enzyme preparation for 30 min before addition of substrate did not diminish the inhibitory effect, confirming that the compounds are not substrates for the enzyme simply acting as competitive inhibitors (Fig.2 A). The K mvalues were determined for each LPP isoform using radiolabeled LPA as substrate in the presence and absence of the phosphonates and used to calculate K i values (Fig. 2 B). This analysis revealed that both of the phosphonates are competitive inhibitors of each of the three LPP isoforms with mid-micromolar affinities (Fig. 2 C). There is a significant difference in the affinity of the phosphonates for the different LPP isoforms: LPP3 > LPP1 > LPP2. It is also noteworthy that theK i values for the ketone compound (wls-60) are very nearly half the values for the hydroxy compound (wls-31) at each isoform. This may reflect the fact that the ketone is a discrete molecule, whereas the hydroxyl compound is racemic. If only one enantiomer of the hydroxyl compound is active, it would be equipotent with the ketone compound. Alternatively, the charge on the head group of the ketone compound may be more consistent with that of LPA than the hydroxy compound, as the pK a of the second dissociable proton of the ketone compound is closer to that of LPA.Figure 2The phosphonates are subtype-specific inhibitors of LPP activity. A, LPP activity in membrane preparations from cells overexpressing each of the LPP isoforms was assayed using 200 nm labeled LPA as substrate. 500 μm wls-31 (α-hydroxy phosphonate) was added as a 50:1 Triton X-100:phosphonate mixture, either simultaneously with the labeled substrate or 30 min prior to the start of the reaction. Control reactions received vehicle (Triton X-100) alone. Each data point was measured in triplicate and is representative of at least three separate experiments; error bars reflect standard error.B, reaction velocities were determined for each LPP isozyme using a range of LPA concentrations in the presence or absence of 500 μm each phosphonate inhibitor. C,K i values were determined from the kinetics curves using the following equation.Km(app)=KmKi[I]+KmView Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Unfortunately, these phosphonate compounds cannot be used in the most obvious experiment, blocking the LPP activity with the phosphonates and determining if there is an effect of LPA potency, because both wls-31 and wls-60 are themselves potent agonists at the LPA receptors. To compare the potency of these compounds with that of LPA at the three cloned LPA receptors, we used a GTPγS binding assay (22Im D.-S. Heise C.E. Harding M.A. George S.R. O'Dowd B.F. Theodorescu D. Lynch K.R. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 57: 753-759Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Membranes from cells overexpressing the three heterotrimeric G-protein subunits along with a receptor are incubated with ligand, GDP, and [35S]GTPγS. The amount of GTPγS bound to the G-proteins is determined by filtering and liquid scintillation counting (see “Experimental Procedures” for details). These assays measure G-protein activation directly, and do not reflect multiple levels of amplification, as do many measures of receptor activation. Therefore, the dose-response curves determined by this assay are often right-shifted with respect to assays of more downstream events (e.g. calcium mobilization). GTPγS binding dose-response curves show that wls-31 and wls-60 are one to two log orders less potent than LPA at Edg-2 and Edg-4 and have negligible activity at Edg-7 at concentrations up to 10 μm (Fig.3). wls-60 is more potent than wls-31 at both Edg-2 and Edg-4. The activity seen with wls-60 at Edg-7 is consistent with the amount of activity in untransfected cells (data not shown); however, all dose-response curves, including LPA, are strongly right-shifted at Edg-7 (2"

As an initial approach to define the role of AGS3 in mammalian signal processing, we defined the AGS3 subdomains involved in G-protein interaction, its selectivity for G-proteins, and its influence on the activation state of G-protein. Immunoblot analysis with AGS3 antisera indicated expression in rat brain, the neuronal-like cell lines PC12 and NG108-15, as well as the smooth muscle cell line DDT1-MF2. Immunofluorescence studies and confocal imaging indicated that AGS3 was predominantly cytoplasmic and enriched in microdomains of the cell. AGS3 coimmunoprecipitated with Gαi3 from cell and tissue lysates, indicating that a subpopulation of AGS3 and Gαi exist as a complex in the cell. The coimmunoprecipitation of AGS3 and Gαi was dependent upon the conformation of Gαi3 (GDP ≫ GTPγS (guanosine 5′-3-O-(thio)triphosphate)). The regions of AGS3 that bound Gαi were localized to four amino acid repeats (G-protein regulatory motif (GPR)) in the carboxyl terminus (Pro463–Ser650), each of which were capable of binding Gαi. AGS3-GPR domains selectively interacted with Gαi in tissue and cell lysates and with purified Gαi/Gαt. Subsequent experiments with purified Gαi2 and Gαi3 indicated that the carboxyl-terminal region containing the four GPR motifs actually bound more than one Gαi subunit at the same time. The AGS3-GPR domains effectively competed with Gβγ for binding to Gαt(GDP) and blocked GTPγS binding to Gαi1.

Conformational changes in receptor subdomains then transfer this signal to a G-protein, promoting exchange of GTP for GDP and subunit dissociation with both the Gα and Gβγ subunits regulating effector molecules. These events are tightly regulated to maximize signal efficiency, optimize signal specificity, and integrate cellular responses to diverse stimuli. Regulatory mechanisms include the segregation of specific signaling molecules in cell microdomains, receptor phosphorylation and internalization, cross-talk between signaling pathways, and proteins that regulate the basal activation state of G-proteins independently of the receptor. We partially purified a direct G-protein activator from NG108-15 cells (1Sato M. Kataoka R. Dingus J. Wilcox M. Hildebrandt J. Lanier S.M. J. Biol.

The identification of such proteins raises many interesting and unexpected questions relative to signal processing by heterotrimeric G-proteins. As an initial approach to address these issues, we focused on the biochemical and functional characterization of AGS1 proteins, and this report deals specifically with AGS3 (AF107723, calculated molecular weight 72,049). AGS3, isolated from a rat brain cDNA library, contains seven tetratricopeptide repeats (TPRs) and four GPR (G-protein-regulatory) motifs separated by a linker in the middle of the protein (4Takesono A. Cismowski M.J. Ribas C. Bernard M. Chung P. Hazard III, S. Duzic E. Lanier S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33202-33205Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar) 2The GPR motif was also termed the GoLoco motif (6Siderovski D.P. Diverse-Pierlussi M.A. De Vries L. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 340-341Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). (Fig.1). AGS3 is one member of a larger protein family defined by a two-domain structure (Fig. 1). In rodents and humans, this family is defined by rat AGS3 and human LGN (U54999), which was isolated in a yeast two-hybrid screen using Gαi2 as bait (8Mochizuki N. Cho G. Wen B. Insel P.A. Gene (Amst.). 1996; 181: 39-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). A single AGS3-related protein is found in Caenorhabditis elegans (AAA81387) and Drosophila melanogaster (AF36967). Analysis of genome and expressed sequence tag data bases indicated that in addition to human LGN cDNAs, there are partial human cDNAs exhibiting higher homology to AGS3 versus LGN (e.g. AL117478 (360 amino acids), 95% sequence similarity to AGS3 and 57% sequence similarity to LGN;AI272212 (190 amino acids), 93% sequence similarity to AGS3 and 57% sequence similarity to LGN). Likewise, analysis of mouse/rat genome and expressed sequence tag data bases indicate that in addition to AGS3 cDNAs (e.g. L23316) there are mouse cDNAs (e.g. AA543923, AA166402, and AW539573) exhibiting higher sequence homology to human LGN versus AGS3. Thus, AGS3 and LGN are distinct proteins, and perhaps there are additional related proteins in the primate genome yet to be identified. The first insight as to the functional role of LGN and AGS3 in signal processing was their identification as a Gαi-binding protein (8Mochizuki N. Cho G. Wen B. Insel P.A. Gene (Amst.). 1996; 181: 39-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) and isolation as a receptor-independent G-protein activator (4Takesono A. Cismowski M.J. Ribas C. Bernard M. Chung P.

Additional insight was provided by recent studies in D. melanogaster, where the AGS3/LGN homolog PINS (Partner of Inscuteable) is required for events involved in the asymmetric cell division of neuroblasts in the early stages of development (9Yu F.W. Morin X. Cai Y. Yang X.H. Chia W. Cell. 2000; 100: 399-409Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar, 10Schaefer M. Schevchenko A. Schevchenko A. Knoblich J.A. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 353-362Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). PINS is part of a multiprotein complex that is translocated from the cytosol to one pole of the dividing neuroblast. In this article, we report the existence of an AGS3-Gαi complex within the cell, define the Gα-interacting domains of AGS3, and determine the selectivity of AGS3 for different Gα subunits. AGS3, which preferentially binds to GαGDP, can bind multiple Gα subunits and hence may function as a scaffolding protein to provide spatially and temporally discrete signaling events. AGS3 and Gβγ actually competed with each other for interaction with Gαt(GDP), and AGS3 inhibited guanine nucleotide exchange on Gαi1. The properties of the AGS3-Gα interactions add unexpected dimensions to signal processing by G-protein-regulated signaling systems.

AGS3 subdomains were generated as glutathione fusion proteins by polymerase chain reaction using the full-length cDNA of AGS3 as a template. Primers were designed to add BamHI and EcoRI sites to the 5′ and 3′ ends, respectively, of AGS3 subdomains to fuse the AGS3 open reading frame with the reading frame of glutathione S-transferase contained in the pGEX4T1 vector. The polymerase chain reactions were generally performed using 250 nm primers and 125 pm template DNA in a total volume of 50 μl. Cycles were 1 × 3 min at 94 °C; 30 × 1.5 min at 94 °C, 1 min at 60 °C, and 2 min at 72 °C; and 1 × 10 min at 72 °C. Primers used to generate specific constructs were as follows.

Caco-2 cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection and cultured in Eagle's minimum essential medium supplemented with 1% minimum essential medium nonessential amino acids. CHO cells were grown on Falcon tissue culture dishes at 37 °C (5% CO2) in Ham's F-12 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum plus penicillin (100 units/ml), streptomycin (100 μg/ml), and fungizone (0.25 μg/ml) (19Wu G.

Rat brain was homogenized in 3 ml of buffer/g of tissue of lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40). Confluent 100-mm dishes of cells were washed with cell washing solution (137 mm NaCl, 2.6 mm KCl, 1.8 mmKH2PO4, 10 mmNa2HPO4) and resuspended in 1 ml of lysis buffer/dish by homogenization. Following a 1-h incubation on ice at 4 °C, the cell homogenate was centrifuged at 27,000 ×g for 30 min. Supernatants were collected and spun at 100,000 × g for 1 h to generate a detergent-soluble fraction. The supernatant was immediately processed for immunoblotting or immunoprecipitation. In some experiments, cells and tissue were also fractionated to generate a crude membrane pellet and a 100,000 × g supernatant containing cytosol. Tissues were homogenized in 5 mm Tris, 5 mmEDTA, 5 mm EGTA, pH 7.4, and centrifuged at 100,000 ×g for 30 min at 4 °C and washed at least three times by homogenization in membrane buffer. For preparation of cell homogenates, 12 confluent 100-mm dishes were lysed in 3 ml of 5 mm Tris, 5 mm EDTA, 5 mm EGTA, pH 7.4, and centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. Cell membrane pellets were washed three times with intervening homogenization and pelleting at 100,000 × g. The washed membrane pellets were resuspended in 250 μl of membrane buffer (50 mmTris, 0.6 mm EDTA, 5 mm MgCl2, pH 7.4) by homogenization. Protein concentrations were determined by a Bio-Rad protein assay. The interaction of AGS3 with G-proteins was assessed by both coimmunoprecipitation and protein interaction experiments using tissue/cell lysates or purified G-proteins. Protein concentrations in the lysates were determined by a Bio-Rad protein assay. For immunoprecipitation from mammalian cells, cell/tissue lysates (1–3 mg of protein in 0.5–1 ml) were pre-cleared by rotating incubation with Gammabind G-Sepharose (12.5 μl of packed resin equilibrated in lysis buffer) for 30 min at 4 °C. Following centrifugation, Gαi3 antisera (1:250 dilution) was added to pre-cleared lysates and incubation continued overnight at 4 °C. Protein complexes were captured by adding Gammabind G-Sepharose (12.5 μl packed volume) and continuing the incubation for 30 min at 4 °C. The mixture was then microcentrifuged at 4 °C and the pellets washed (3× 500 μl of incubation buffer) and resuspended in 2× Laemmli buffer. Resuspended samples were placed in a boiling water bath for 5 min and microcentrifuged for 10 min prior to loading on denaturing 10% polyacrylamide gels. Proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes for immunoblotting. For analysis of the interaction of AGS3-GPR with multiple G-protein subunits, Gαi2 (200 nm) was incubated with Gαi3 (50 nm) in the presence or absence of the AGS3-GPR GST fusion protein (250 nm) in 250 μl of buffer A (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 70 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.6 mm EDTA, 0.01% Thesit) for 1 h at 4 °C. Gαi3 antisera (1: 500) was added, and the incubation was continued for 3 h at 4 °C. Protein complexes were isolated and evaluated by immunoblotting as described above. Protein interaction assays using purified G-protein subunits were conducted as described previously (4Takesono A. Cismowski M.J. Ribas C. Bernard M. Chung P. Hazard III, S. Duzic E. Lanier S.M. J.

Unless indicated otherwise, all G-protein interaction assays contained 10 μm GDP. The AGS3-GST fusion proteins were expressed in and purified from bacteria using a glutathione affinity matrix. The AGS3-GST fusion proteins were eluted from the matrix with glutathione and desalted by centrifugation (Centricon YM-3; Millipore, Bedford, MA). For interaction assays with cell/tissue lysates, the AGS3-GST fusion protein (100–300 nm) was incubated with purified G-protein (50–100 nm) or cell/tissue lysate (∼4 mg of protein/ml) for 1 h at 24 °C in a total volume of 250 μl. 12.5 μl of packed glutathione-Sepharose slurry was added and the mixture rotated at 4 °C for 20 min, after which the affinity matrix was pelleted and washed three times with 500 μl of incubation buffer. Proteins retained on the matrix were solubilized in 2× Laemmli loading buffer and separated by electrophoresis on denaturing 10% polyacrylamide gels. Proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes for immunoblotting. Each blot was checked by Amido Black staining to verify equal loading of fusion proteins. DDT1-MF2 control cells and DDT1-MF2 cells stably transfected with AGS3 were plated onto coverslips (18-mm round no. 1) precoated with 0.01% polylysine and allowed to grow to 60% confluence. Coverslips were then rinsed with 3 × 2 ml of cell washing solution (CWS) (137 mmNaCl, 2.6 mm KCl, 1.8 mmKH2PO4, 10 mmNa2HPO4) and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min, followed by two 5-min incubations in CWS containing 0.1m glycine (3 ml/coverslip). Coverslips were then incubated in 0.01% Triton X-100 for 10 min, followed by three 5-min incubations (3 ml/coverslip) with CWS. Fixed cells were then incubated in 10% goat serum for 1 h and washed once with CWS. AGS3 antibody was diluted into CWS containing 2% goat serum and 1% fetal bovine serum and then centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min prior to use. Coverslips were incubated with 75 μl of AGS3 antibody (0.01 mg/ml) for 1 h by placing the coverslips (cell side down) on parafilm in a humidified chamber. Following incubation with AGS3 antibody, coverslips were washed three times (3 ml/coverslip) with CWS and then incubated with goat anti-rabbit biotin conjugate (1:800) for 40 min. The fixed cells were washed three times in CWS and incubated in Extravidin fluorescein isothiocyanate (1:500) for 40 min, followed by three 10 min incubations with CWS. Washed coverslips were mounted in Immuno Fluore, sealed with nail polish, and stored at 4 °C until evaluated by fluorescent microscopy. All incubations were carried out at 24 °C. Mounted slips were evaluated on a Leica DMLB fluorescent microscope and by confocal microscopy using a Bio-Rad MRC-100 laser scanning confocal imaging system. The cell nucleus was identified by propidium iodide staining. Multiple series of experiments were performed to determine the optimal conditions for signal detection and to verify the specificity of observed signals. These experiments included different methods of fixation and permeabilization as well as a matrix with serial dilutions of primary antibodies and secondary conjugates. We chose to generate stable transfectants to minimize any artifacts introduced by transient transfection. Only very weak immunofluorescence signals were detected in nontransfected DDT1-MF2 cells as expected from the relative strengths of the signals for control and AGS3-transfected cells observed by immunoblotting. No immunofluorescent signal was detected in control or AGS3 transfectants in the absence of any primary antibody. Nucleotide binding assays were conducted by a modification of a described previously techniques (2Sato M. Ribas C. Hildebrandt J.D. Lanier S.M. J. Biol.

G-proteins (100 nm) were preincubated with varying amounts of AGS3 subdomain proteins or GST controls for 15 min at 24 °C (binding buffer = 50 mm Hepes-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 50 μm adenosine triphosphate, 10 μg/ml bovine serum albumin) prior to addition of 0.5–1 μm GTPγS (4.0 × 104 dpm/pmol); the final incubation volume was 50 μl. Samples were incubated with GTPγS at 24 °C for 30 min. Incubated reactions were terminated by rapid filtration through nitrocellulose filters (Schleicher & Schuell BA85) with four 4-ml washes of stop buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.4, 4 °C). Radioactivity bound to the filters was determined by liquid scintillation counting. DDT1-MF2 cells were stably transfected with pcDNA3.AGS3 by DNA/calcium phosphate coprecipitation (21Duzic E. Lanier S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 24045-24052Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For antipeptide antisera, AGS3 peptides (P-32 Thr306–Ile436 and P-22 Asp528–Gly550) were synthesized and conjugated for generation of rabbit polyclonal antisera using the Peptide Synthesis and Antibody Production Facility at the Medical University of South Carolina. Each of the three antisera specifically recognized GST-AGS3 at reasonable dilutions of serum and were affinity-purified. Denaturing gel electrophoresis and immunoblotting were performed as described previously (18Wu G. Hildebrandt J. Benovic J.L. Lanier S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7197-7200Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). For reprobing of membrane transfers , the membrane transfers were washed with buffer A containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 140 mm NaCl, 0.2% Tween each and then incubated with pre-heated stripping buffer (62.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 100 mmβ-mercaptoethanol) for 20 min in a 55 °C water bath with gentle shaking. The membrane was then washed with buffer A and processed for immunoblotting. For Coomassie Blue staining of proteins, gels were incubated in 100 ml of staining buffer (0.25% Coomassie Blue in 45% methanol, 45% H2O, 10% glacial acetic acid) for 30 min at room temperature. Stained gels were then washed in 100 ml of destain solution (45% methanol, 45% H2O, 10% glacial acetic acid) and incubated for 30 min. Gels were then washed in fresh destain solution every 30 min until protein bands were visible. Immunoblots with AGS3 antipeptide antibodies indicated expression of AGS3 (Mr ∼ 74,000) in rat brain, the neuroblastoma-glioma cell hybrid NG108-15 (rat/murine) the rat pheochromocytoma cell line PC12, and the DDT1-MF2 smooth muscle cell line derived from hamster vas deferens (Fig.2). Immunoreactive species with an apparent Mr of ∼74,000 were not detected in rat liver, rat kidney, Caco-2 cells, CHO cells, HEK cells, or NIH-3T3 fibroblasts (Fig. 2). 3M. L. Bernard and S. M. Lanier, unpublished observations. The same immunoreactive Mr ∼74,000 species was observed with two different antibodies (P-32, P-22) generated against peptides derived from different regions of the protein (Fig. 2). Fractionation of tissues/cells expressing AGS3 indicated that AGS3 is enriched in the 100,000 × g supernatant consistent with a major distribution of AGS3 in the cytosol (Fig.3 A). A similar fractionation of AGS3 was observed in DDT1-MF2 cells stably transfected with AGS3 (Fig. 3 A). The subcellular localization of AGS3 was also addressed by immunofluorescence analysis following stable expression of AGS3 in the DDT1-MF2 cell line (Fig.3 B). Confocal microscopy was used to generate an image approximately through the middle plane of the cell. The immunofluorescent image indicates that AGS3 is predominantly cytosolic (Fig. 3 B), as suggested by immunoblot analysis of the 100,000 × g supernatant from cell lysates illustrated in Fig. 3 A. Within the cell, the AGS3 signal is often punctate and occasionally enriched in microdomains of the cell.Figure 3Subcellular distribution of AGS3. A, tissues or confluent dishes of cell lines were fractionated into a 100,000 × g supernatant (S) and 100,000 × g pellet (P) as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Membrane transfers were immunoblotted with AGS3 antisera P-32. The immunoblot is representative of results obtained in three different experiments. The lines to the right of the blot indicated the migration of size standards (low molecular weight; Bio-Rad) × 10−3. The arrows to the left of the immunoblot indicate the migration of AGS3. Each lane contains 100 μg of protein. DDT, DDT1-MF2 cells; DDT-AGS3, DDT1-MF2 cells stably transfected with rat AGS3. B, immunofluorescent analysis of AGS3 distribution in DDT1-MF2 cells stably transfected with AGS3. Cells were fixed and processed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Confocal microscopy was used to evaluate images through different planes of the cells, and the micrograph shown is the image taken from approximately the middle plane of the cells. The large rounded area in the middle of the cell devoid of signal corresponds to the cell nucleus as defined by propidium iodide staining. This image was generated with a Bio-Rad MRC-100 laser scanning confocal imaging system (magnification, ×63; 30% laser power; gain, 1250; IRS, 0.7). This figure is representative of five to seven images obtained by different fixation methods and using different antibody concentrations. Only very weak immunofluorescence signals were detected in nontransfected DDT1-MF2 cells as expected from the relative strengths of the signals for control and AGS3-transfected cells observed by immunoblotting in A. No immunofluorescent signal was detected in control or AGS3 transfectants in the absence of any primary antibody.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We previously reported that the carboxyl-terminal 74 amino acids of AGS3 were active in the yeast functional screen and that this peptide fragment directly bound to Gαi (4Takesono A.

We thus asked if full-length AGS3 was complexed with Gαi3 in lysates of rat brain or DDT1-MF2 cells stably transfected with AGS3. As AGS3 preferentially regulated Gαi2 and Gαi3 in the yeast functional assay (4Takesono A. Cismowski M.J. Ribas C. Bernard M. Chung P. Hazard III, S. Duzic E. Lanier S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33202-33205Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar), we first approached this issue by immunoprecipitation of Gαi3. Approximately 30% of brain lysate Gαi3 was immunoprecipated with a Gαi3 carboxyl terminus antibody. Immunoblots of membrane transfers containing Gαi3immunoprecipitates indicated that AGS3 coimmunoprecipitated with Gαi in a nucleotide-dependent manner (Fig.4). The absence of Gβ in the GTPγS-treated samples provided internal controls for G-protein activation and subunit dissociation by added GTPγS/Mg2+. Immunoprecipitation experiments were also conducted with the AGS3 antisera P-32. Although AGS3 was effectively immunoprecipitated by the P-32 antisera in each cell/tissue extract, coimmunoprecipitation of Gαi3 was variab"

Angeli's salt (Na2N2O3; AS) is a NO− donor that has been shown to exert marked cytotoxicity. However, its decomposition intermediates have not been well characterized. In this study, the chemical reactivity of AS was examined and compared with that of peroxynitrite (ONOO−) and NO/N2O3. Under aerobic conditions, AS and ONOO− exhibited similar and considerably higher affinities for dihydrorhodamine (DHR) than NO/N2O3. Quenching of DHR oxidation by azide and nitrosation of diaminonaphthalene were exclusively observed with NO/N2O3. Additional comparison of ONOO− and AS chemistry demonstrated that ONOO− was a far more potent one-electron oxidant and nitrating agent of hydroxyphenylacetic acid than was AS. However, AS was more effective at hydroxylating benzoic acid than was ONOO−. Taken together, these data indicate that neither NO/N2O3 nor ONOO− is an intermediate of AS decomposition. Evaluation of the stoichiometry of AS decomposition and O2 consumption revealed a 1:1 molar ratio. Indeed, oxidation of DHR mediated by AS proved to be oxygen-dependent. Analysis of the end products of AS decomposition demonstrated formation of NO2− and NO3− in approximately stoichiometric ratios. Several mechanisms are proposed for O2 adduct formation followed by decomposition to NO3− or by oxidation of an HN2O3−molecule to form NO2−. Given that the cytotoxicity of AS is far greater than that of either NO/N2O3 or NO + O⨪2, this study provides important new insights into the implications of the potential endogenous formation of NO− under inflammatory conditionsin vivo.

Mitchell J.B. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1998; 25: 434-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (1290) Google Scholar). Although NO is a radical, it is relatively unreactive toward other biomolecules including thiols and amines. However, a variety of redox reactions can convert NO into reactive nitrogen oxide species (RNOS)1 that have a myriad of effects in biological systems. For example, N2O3 and peroxynitrite (ONOO−), which are produced by the reaction of NO with O2 or superoxide (O⨪2), respectively, can lead to oxidation, hydroxylation, nitration, and nitrosation of biomolecules (1Wink D.A. Mitchell J.B. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1998; 25: 434-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (1290) Google Scholar). Although a substantial literature exists on the putative biological effects of other RNOS, few studies have focused on nitroxyl (NO−), the one electron reduction product of NO. Several reports suggest that NO− (or its conjugate acid, HNO) can be generated from chemical reactions that occur in vivo (2Fukuto J.M. Hobbs A.J. Ignarro L.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Nitrosation. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, UK1988: 179Google Scholar). Taken together, these studies indicate that the chemistry of NO− is an essential component of the redox chemistry of NO in biological systems. Angeli's salt (AS) is the most commonly used synthetic donor in the study of NO− effects under biological conditions (9Feelisch M. Stamler J.S. Feelisch M. Stamler J. Methods in Nitric Oxide Research. John Wiley & Sons, New York1996: 71-115Google Scholar). At physiological pH and temperature, AS spontaneously decomposes to HNO and nitrite with a half-life of 2.5 min,N2O32−+H+→HNO+NO2−Equation 1 The cytotoxic effects of AS are several orders of magnitude greater than those of other RNOS and are comparable to alkylhydroperoxides (10Wink D.A. Feelisch M. Fukuto J. Chistodoulou D. Jourd'heuil D. Grisham M.B. Vodovotz Y. Cook J.A. Krishna M. DeGraff W.G. Kim S. Gamson J. Mitchell J.B. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1998; 351: 66-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar), suggesting that NO− formationin vivo could have deleterious consequences. In a myocardial ischemia-reperfusion model, treatment with AS markedly increased infarct area (11Ma X.L. Gao F. Liu G.-L. Lopez B.L. Christopher T.A. Fukuto J.M. Wink D.A. Feelisch M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 14617-14622Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). In contrast, NO, either from a donor or from oxidation of NO− in the presence of an electron acceptor, afforded protection in the same model. In the present report, the chemistry of AS is compared with that of ONOO− and NO/N2O3 to gain insight into the biological mechanisms in which the chemistry of NO− could be involved. Angeli's salt (Na2N2O3) was synthesized as described previously (10Wink D.A. Feelisch M. Fukuto J. Chistodoulou D. Jourd'heuil D. Grisham M.B. Vodovotz Y. Cook J.A. Krishna M. DeGraff W.G. Kim S.

The NONOate, DEA/NO (NaEt2NN(O)NO), was a generous gift from Dr. Joseph Saavedra (National Cancer Institute, Frederick, MD). Stock solutions (∼10 mm) of AS and DEA/NO were prepared in 10 mm NaOH and stored at −20 °C (12Maragos C.M. Morley D. Wink D.A. Dunams T.M. Saavedra J.E. Hoffman A. Bove A.A. Isaac L. Hrabie J.A. Keefer L.K. J. Med. Chem. 1991; 34: 3242-3247Crossref PubMed Scopus (698) Google Scholar). Peroxynitrite was synthesized by mixing solutions of 0.5 mNO2− in 0.5 m HCl and 0.5m hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) followed by rapid quenching in 1 m NaOH, as described previously (13Beckman J.S.

The resulting basic solution was exposed to MnO2 to remove excess H2O2, which was reduced to <1% per mol of ONOO−. After filtering, aliquots were stored at −20 °C for less than 2 weeks. Directly prior to use, the concentrations of these RNOS donors in 10 mm NaOH were determined from the absorbance values at 250 nm for AS and DEA/NO (ε = 8000 m−1 cm−1 (12Maragos C.M. Morley D.

Chem. 1991; 34: 3242-3247Crossref PubMed Scopus (698) Google Scholar)) and 302 nm for ONOO− (ε = 1670m−1 cm−1 (14Hughes, M. N., and Nicklin, H. G. (1968) J. Chem. Soc. A451Google Scholar)). Sodium azide, sodium bicarbonate, hydroxylamine (NH2OH), glutathione (GSH), methionine, uric acid, ascorbic acid, horseradish peroxidase, manganese(IV) oxide, DTPA, and dimethylformamide (DMF) were purchased from Sigma while sodium iodide, sodium nitrite, sodium nitrate, and vanadium(III) chloride were obtained from Aldrich. Stock solutions were prepared fresh daily at 100× in Milli-Q filtered H2O unless otherwise noted. The assay buffer contained the metal chelator DTPA (50 μm) in calcium and magnesium-free Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.4) ±10 mmHEPES as indicated. All experiments were performed in triplicate at 37 °C except those involving ONOO−, which were carried out at room temperature. Data reported in text and tables are mean values from n = 2–4 individual experiments. Figures are either representative data sets or mean values, if error bars are shown, from n = 2–4 individual experiments. UV-visible spectroscopy was performed with a Hewlett-Packard 8452A diode-array spectrophotometer. Fluorescence measurements were acquired on a PerkinElmer Life Sciences LS50B fluorometer using 2.5-mm slit widths unless otherwise stated. Oxygen consumption was determined using a Medical Systems LiCOX instrument with a Revoxode oxygen catheter-microprobe electrode (Harvard Apparatus, Holliston, MA). Chemiluminescent detection of NO was accomplished with a Sievers NO analyzer (Boulder, CO). Oxidation chemistry mediated by RNOS was evaluated by formation of the fluorescent dye rhodamine 123 (RH) from dihydrorhodamine 123 (DHR) (15Miles A.M. Bohle D.S. Glassbrenner P.A. Hansert B. Wink D.A. Grisham M.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 40-47Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). Stock solutions of 50 mmDHR (10 mg; Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) were prepared in DMF (0.6 ml) immediately prior to use. Further dilutions in DMF were prepared such that the amount of DMF added to the assay buffer was minimized (≤10 μl). Typically, addition of DHR to 1 ml of assay buffer, containing 100× quenching agent as appropriate, was followed by RNOS donor compound (50–200×). After a 30-min incubation for AS or DEA/NO at 37 °C or 5 min at room temperature for ONOO−, 1 ml of H2O was added, and the fluorescence was measured at 570 nm with excitation at 500 nm. Since DHR slowly autoxidizes to RH, background fluorescence in assay buffer alone was subtracted from the measured values with RNOS donors. Standard curves were obtained using authentic RH (Molecular Probes). The O2 dependence of DHR oxidation by AS was examined in a similar manner except that the buffer was purged with argon and transferred by syringe to a septum-capped, argon-flushed cuvette prior to AS addition. One-electron oxidation ofp-hydroxyphenylacetic acid (HPA; Aldrich) was measured as previously reported (16Ischiropoulos H. Nelson J. Duran D. Al-Mehdi A. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1996; 20: 373-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Stock solutions of 100 mm HPA in H2O were diluted in assay buffer as appropriate. The procedure is similar to that described above for DHR oxidation except that fluorescent product formation was monitored at 400 nm with 326 nm excitation. Nitration of HPA was also accomplished in an analogous manner to DHR oxidation except that following decomposition of the RNOS donor, the reaction solution was diluted in 10 mm NaOH, and the yellow product was quantified from the absorption at 430 nm (ε = 4400 m−1 cm−1 (17Briviba K.

Chen J. Harrison J. Martin J.C. Tsai M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1992; 298: 438-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (730) Google Scholar)). Hydroxylation of benzoic acid (BA; Aldrich; 100 mm in 100 mm NaOH) was measured under similar conditions as described for DHR oxidation except that an appropriate amount of 1 m HCl was used to neutralize added NaOH. The fluorescent product was detected at 410 nm with excitation at 290 nm and slit widths of 5.0 mm (15Miles A.M. Bohle D.S. Glassbrenner P.A. Hansert B. Wink D.A. Grisham M.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 40-47Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). Formation of N2O3 was monitored indirectly byN-nitrosation of 2,3-diaminonaphthalene (DAN; Sigma), which yields the fluorescent product 2,3-naphthotriazole (19Jourd'heuil D. Miranda K.M. Kim S.M. Espey M.G. Vodovotz Y. Laroux S. Mai C.T. Miles A.M. Grisham M.B. Wink D.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1999; 365: 92-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Stock solutions of DAN (100 mm) were prepared in DMF. After incubation with RNOS donor and dilution with 1 ml of 10 mmNaOH, fluorescence was measured at 450 nm with excitation at 375 nm. The amount of O2 consumed by 1.7 ml of assay buffer + 10 mm HEPES containing 10–60 μm AS was determined from the amplitude of the signal decay at 37 °C assuming that 1 mm Hg corresponds to 1.4 μm O2 (20Forstner H. Gnaiger E. Gnaiger E. Forstner H. Polarographic Oxygen Sensors. Springer-Verlag, Berlin1983: 321Crossref Google Scholar). The effects of various compounds on consumption of O2 by 60 μm AS were also examined. The concentrations of both NO2− and NO3− after complete decomposition of RNOS in assay buffer donor were determined by chemiluminscence. Sample aliquots were injected into an anaerobic (argon-purged) reaction vessel containing either NaI/glacial acetic acid (NO2− reduction) or hot VCl3, 1 m HCl (95 °C; NO2− and NO3− reduction). The resulting NO was drawn by vacuum into the detector where it reacted with O3. The chemiluminescent reaction was quantified and integrated with a photomultiplier tube/computer system. Nitrite values were validated using the Griess reaction and were found to correspond within ±5%. Formation of H2O2 was measured using a fluorescence method described previously (21Hyslop P.A. Sklar L.A. Anal. Biochem. 1984; 141: 280-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar, 22Wink D.A. Cook J.A. Pacelli R. DeGraff W. Gamson J. Liebmann J. Krishna M.C. Mitchell J.B. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 331: 241-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). After decomposition of the RNOS donor in 1 ml of assay buffer, 100 μl of analyte solution (3 parts of 10 mg/ml HPA in H2O to 1 part of 10 mg/ml horseradish peroxidase in H2O) and 1 ml of buffer were added. The resulting fluorescence was monitored at 400 with 326 nm emission. Conversion of DHR into the fluorescent dye RH has been used as an in vitro dosimeter for two-electron oxidation reactions mediated by species such as ONOO− and Fe/H2O2 (23Crow J.P. Nitric Oxide. 1997; 1: 145-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (549) Google Scholar). When increasing concentrations of AS (5–100 μm) were exposed to buffer solutions containing 50 μm DHR, corresponding increases in RH production were observed (data not shown). Analogously, varying the DHR concentration (5–100 μm) in the presence of 10 μm AS resulted in a concentration-dependent increase in the observed fluorescence. The double-reciprocal plot of RH concentration versus DHR concentration is linear with − Xint−1 (defined asX m ) of 3.5 ± 0.5 μm and Yint−1 of 5.5 ± 1 μm (Fig. 1). These values represent the concentration of DHR that leads to 50% maximal RH production and the maximal yield of RH at infinite concentration of DHR for X m and Yint−1, respectively. When DHR (10–100 μm) was exposed to 10 μm AS in argon-purged assay buffer + 10 mm HEPES, oxidation decreased by 85% compared with incubations carried out under aerobic conditions, indicating that O2 is required for NO−-mediated DHR oxidation (Fig.2).Figure 2Effect of O2 on AS-mediated DHR oxidation. 10 μm AS was exposed to DHR (10–100 μm) in aerated (black bars) or argon-purged (hatched bars) assay buffer + 10 mm HEPES.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) As this O2 dependence could be explained by reaction between NO− and O2 to yield ONOO−, the oxidative properties of ONOO− were examined. In the presence of 10 μm ONOO−, increased DHR concentration resulted in a concentration-dependent increase in fluorescence, analogously to AS. The linear double-reciprocal plot exhibits anX m of 3.5 ± 0.5 μm and an Yint−1 of 2.5 ± 0.5 μm (Fig. 1). The similar affinities of the oxidants produced from ONOO− and AS for DHR under similar reaction conditions further suggested that ONOO− might be an intermediate in the chemistry of AS. Since CO2 can affect the chemistry of ONOO−(24Lymar S.V. Hurst J.K. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1995; 117: 8867-8868Crossref Scopus (491) Google Scholar), DHR oxidation was investigated in the presence of 25 mm HCO3−. Under these conditions, increasing DHR concentration resulted in increased fluorescence by both 10 μm AS and 10 μmONOO− (data not shown). The X m values with HCO3− are 4.0 ± 1 and 11 ± 3 μm, respectively, whereas the Yint−1 values were largely unchanged by HCO3−. Although the affinity for DHR was not altered in HCO3− buffer, synthetic ONOO−-mediated DHR oxidation was quenched by CO2. Interestingly, DHR oxidation due to simultaneous exposure to xanthine oxidase (an O⨪2 generator) and NONOates in the presence of HEPES has previously been shown to be unaffected by CO2 (19Jourd'heuil D. Miranda K.M. Kim S.M. Espey M.G. Vodovotz Y. Laroux S. Mai C.T. Miles A.M. Grisham M.B. Wink D.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1999; 365: 92-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The effect of the NO donor DEA/NO on DHR oxidation was examined to determine whether a RNOS derived from NO, such as N2O3, was a potential oxidative intermediate from AS decomposition. DEA/NO (5 μm; 2 mol of NO are produced per mol of DEA/NO) increased fluorescence intensity in a DHR concentration-dependent manner with X m of 100 ± 25 μm and Yint−1 of 1 ± 0.5 μm (Fig. 1). The high X m value for DEA/NO as compared with AS and ONOO− indicates that the species generated in the autoxidation of NO has a lower affinity for DHR. Since the reaction in question is oxidation of DHR, the highX m value for DEA/NO further suggests that the reactive intermediate has a lower relative oxidation potential than those species formed from the other two RNOS donors. Further elucidation of the chemical nature of the oxidizing species derived from AS was accomplished through the use of selective scavengers. Although 10 mm HEPES inhibits DHR oxidation, the effect is minimized at higher concentrations of DHR (i.e. 50 μm; data not shown). Therefore, for these assays, HEPES was included to provide further buffering capacity over phosphate-buffered saline alone. Azide (N3−), which is a good scavenger of NO+ donors such as N2O3, did not significantly affect the oxidation of 50 μm DHR mediated by either 10 μm AS or ONOO− (data not shown). In contrast, DHR oxidation by DEA/NO was completely quenched by 1 mm N3− under the same conditions. Moreover, although DAN was readily nitrosated by DEA/NO, neither AS nor ONOO− produced significant fluorescent product (data not shown). These data indicate that NO+donating intermediates like N2O3 can be eliminated as possible candidates in AS chemistry. Additionally, both N3− and DAN were shown to provide excellent tools to distinguish N2O3-mediated modifications from those by AS or ONOO−. Hydroxylamine reacts with HNO to form N2 and 2 H2O (25Bonner F.T. Stedman G. Feelisch M. Stamler J. Methods in Nitric Oxide Research. John Wiley & Sons, New York1996: 3-18Google Scholar). When 10 μm AS was exposed to solutions containing varying amounts of NH2OH (0.05–2 mm), oxidation of 50 μm DHR was quenched such that the reciprocal plot of RH concentration versusNH2OH concentration is linear with an −X int (defined as X i ) of 130 ± 10 μm NH2OH (data not shown). Conversely, oxidation by ONOO− was not substantially affected by NH2OH. Numerous compounds, including GSH, methionine, urate, and ascorbate react with ONOO− (26Koppenol W.H. Moreno J.J. Pryor W.A. Ischiropoulos H. Beckman J.S. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1992; 5: 834-842Crossref PubMed Scopus (1269) Google Scholar, 27Kooy N.W. Royall J.A. Ischiropoulos H. Beckman J.S. Free Radic. Biol.

A. 1994; 91: 11173-11177Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). Oxidation by ONOO−was quenched proportionally with increasing GSH (0.1–2 mm) such that 50% quenching occurred at 0.7 ± 0.1 mm GSH (Fig. 3 A). Nearly stoichiometric quenching was observed for AS which suggests anX i of <10 μm. In the presence of 2–20 mm methionine, AS and ONOO−-mediated DHR oxidation were similarly impeded with X i of 2.9 ± 0.6 and 4.7 ± 0.4 mm, respectively (Fig.3 B). In the presence of increasing concentrations (0.05–1 mm) of urate (dissolved in 100 mm NaOH) or ascorbate, DHR oxidation mediated by both AS and ONOO− was quenched dramatically (X i < 100 μm; data not shown). The chemistry associated with reactive oxygen species and RNOS can be examined using HPA. In the presence of powerful oxidants such as those formed from peroxidases and H2O2, HPA is converted into a fluorescent dimer through an initial one-electron oxidation (16Ischiropoulos H. Nelson J. Duran D. Al-Mehdi A. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1996; 20: 373-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The extent of nitration can also be evaluated through modification of HPA to the yellow product, 3-nitro-HPA (17Briviba K. Tamler R. Klotz L.-O. Engman L. Cotgreave I.A. Sies H. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1998; 55: 817-823Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 18Beckman J.S. Ischiropoulos H. Zhu L. van der Woerd M. Smith C. Chen J. Harrison J. Martin J.C. Tsai M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1992; 298: 438-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (730) Google Scholar). Exposure of ONOO− (50–500 μm) to solutions containing 1 mm HPA resulted in a concentration-dependent increase in fluorescence (Fig.4). However, AS did not appreciably oxidize HPA under the same conditions. Chromophore bleaching by AS (0.1 and 1 mm) of HPA solutions previously exposed to ONOO− to produce the fluorescent dimer was not observed (data not shown). This suggests that AS per se did not interfere with the fluorescent product. These results show that ONOO− readily mediates one-electron oxidation while AS does not. Previous studies demonstrated that CO2 enhances nitration (29Gow A. Duran D. Thom S.R. Ischiropoulos H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 333: 42-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar, 30Lemercier J.-N. Padmaja S. Cueto R. Squadrito G.L. Uppu R.M. Pryor W.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 345: 160-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 31Lymar S.V. Jiang Q. Hurst J.K. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 7855-7861Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). High concentrations of ONOO− (>100 μm) readily nitrated 1 mm HPA, and in the presence of 25 mm HCO3−considerably more nitration product was observed (data not shown). Conversely, when HPA was exposed to AS, a peak at 430 nm was not detected in the presence or absence of HCO3−. This is consistent with a report that suggests that free tyrosine is nitrated by ONOO− but not by AS (32Ohshima H. Celan I. Chazotte L. Pignatelli B. Mower H.F. Nitric Oxide. 1999; 3: 132-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Indeed, high performance liquid chromatography analysis indicated that at 5 mm RNOS donor, with or without HCO3−, significant formation of 3-nitrotyrosine occurred with ONOO− and SIN-1, which cogenerates NO and O⨪2, but not with AS (data not shown). Modification of BA to the fluorescent compound 2-hydroxybenzoic acid (2-OHBA) was used to assess hydroxylating capacity. Exposure of 1 mm BA to increasing concentrations of ONOO− or AS (0.05–1 mm) resulted in a concentration-dependent increase in fluorescence (Fig. 5 A). Double-reciprocal plots of fluorescence intensity versus BA concentration (0.5–10 mm), as a result of exposure to 500 μm RNOS donor, are linear with X m of 1.2 ± 0.5 and 1.8 ± 0.5 mm and Yint−1 of 1055 ± 100 and 100 ± 20 for AS and ONOO−, respectively (Fig.5 B). Under anaerobic conditions DHR oxidation by AS was considerably lower than in the presence of O2 (Fig. 2). To gain insight into the nature of the intermediate involved, the amount of O2 consumed by AS (10–60 μm) in assay buffer + 10 mm HEPES was measured electrochemically. The O2 concentration decreased with a half-life similar to that observed for decomposition of AS and with an approximate 1:1 stoichiometric ratio between AS (and thus NO−) and O2 (Fig.6). Further measurements were performed to indicate whether O2is required for reaction of AS with various compounds (Fig. 6). Addition of GSH markedly inhibited O2 consumption, suggesting that NO−/HNO reacts directly with this nucleophile. Ascorbate and NH2OH also reduced O2 consumption by AS, although to a lesser degree. Conversely, DHR, methionine, urate, and BA did not substantially alter the amount of O2 consumed, indicating that these compounds either do not react directly with NO− or that the reaction rate of NO− with O2 is faster than with these compounds. These observations show that the chemistry of AS occurs through both O2-dependent and independent mechanisms. Chemiluminescent analysis of the nitrogenous end products from the decomposition of AS under aerobic conditions provided further information as to the chemical nature of the intermediate. Significantly more NO2− than NO3− was detected. However, since AS decomposes to equimolar amounts of NO2−and NO− (Equation 1), at least 50% of the NO2− formed is not due to the chemistry of NO−. Subtracting the AS concentration from the total NO2− concentration results in approximately stoichiometric yields of NO2− and NO3− formed from NO−chemistry alone (data not shown). The NO3− values are subject to significant error particularly at the lower concentrations due to signal to noise restraints and the differential calculation involved ([NO3−] = ([NOx−] as determined from VCl3 reduction) − (total [NO2−] as determined from NaI reduction − [AS]). The product yields varied with AS concentration due to the spontaneous dimerization of HNO, which competes with the reaction of NO− and O2, 2HNO→N2O+H2OEquation 2 Hydrogen peroxide and O⨪2 have been proposed as products of AS decomposition in aerated solution (2Fukuto J.M. Hobbs A.J. Ignarro L.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 196: 707-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Following AS (5–100 μm) decomposition in assay buffer, the samples were assayed for peroxide by the peroxidase/HPA assay (21Hyslop P.A. Sklar L.A. Anal. Biochem. 1984; 141: 280-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar, 22Wink D.A. Cook J.A. Pacelli R. DeGraff W. Gamson J. Liebmann J. Krishna M.C. Mitchell J.B. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 331: 241-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Formation of H2O2 was dependent upon HEPES in a dose-dependent manner (<1% without HEPES, 10–25% with HEPES; data not shown). In comparison, decomposition of ONOO− produced 2–3-fold less H2O2under identical conditions. As the metal chelator DTPA was always present in the assay buffer, the measured chemistry was not a result of Fenton reactions with contaminating metals. Nitroxyl can be formed from various reactions and has been proposed to be an important intermediate in the in vivometabolism of NO (10Wink D.A. Feelisch M. Fukuto J. Chistodoulou D. Jourd'heuil D.

However, the role of this RNOS in biological systems is not clear, partly due to the lack of understanding of its chemical properties. Several studies have suggested that NO−/HNO is a product of NOS (4Hobbs A.J. Fukuto J.M. Ignarro L.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Although controversial, this possibility cannot as yet be discounted. Additional sources of NO− may be the decomposition ofS-nitrosothiols (7Arnelle D.R. Stamler J.S. Arch. Biochem.

Our early approach using Southern hybridization failed to detect the existence of β3Gal-T1 homologous genes. However, recent accumulation of nucleotide sequence information on human cDNAs and genes such as expressed sequence tags (ESTs) enabled us to search homologous genes that do not have high similarity as detected by hybridization, but show significant similarity. A homology search based on the nucleotide or amino acid sequence of β3Gal-T1 led to the isolation of β3Gal-T2, -T3, and -T4, indicating that β3Gal-Ts form a family (1Sasaki, K., Sasaki, E., Kawashima, K., Hanai, N., Nishi, T., and Hasegawa, M.

The activity of β3Gal-T3 has not been detected, whereas the corresponding mouse enzyme exhibits weak β3Gal-T activity for both GlcNAc and GalNAc (5Hennet T. Dinter A. Kuhnert P. Mattu T.S. Rudd M.P.

On the other hand, β3Gal-T4 transfers galactose to the GalNAc residue of asialo-GM2 or GM2 to catalyze the formation of asialo-GM1 or GM1, respectively (3Amado K. Almeida R. Carneiro F. Leverly S.B.

Togayachi A. Kudo T. Nishihara S. Watanabe M. Kubota T. Kitajima M. Shiraishi N. Sasaki K. Andoh T. Narimatsu H. J. Biol.

Dinter A. Gutierrez Gallego R. Kamerling J.P. Vliegenthart J.F. Berger E.G. Hennet T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 406-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). β3Gn-T1 shows significant overall similarity to β3Gal-Ts (15–19%) and shares motifs conserved among the β3Gal-Ts, but is structurally distinct from another type of β1,3-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase (iGnT) that was isolated by expression cloning using an anti-i-antigen antibody (8Sasaki K. Kurata-Miura K. Ujita M. Angata K. Nakagawa S. Sekine S. Nishi T. Fukuda M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 14294-14299Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). β3Gn-T1 exhibits β1,3-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase activity instead of β1,3-galactosyltransferase activity. This result provides an exception that a glycosyltransferase structurally related to the β3Gal-T family uses distinct donor (GlcNAc versus Gal) and acceptor (Gal versus GlcNAc) substrates, maintaining the same linkage specificity (β1,3-linkage).During the course of study to isolate β3Gal-T1 homologs, we have identified three additional types of putative members of the β3Gal-T family. In this study, we show additional examples that glycosyltransferases structurally related to the β3Gal-T family exhibit β1,3-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase activity, but not β1,3-galactosyltransferase activity. These results indicate that β1,3-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferases (β3Gn-Ts) form a family having structural similarity to the β3Gal-T family. Alignment of primary sequences of all members of the β3Gn-T and β3Gal-T families revealed that the members are clustered into four subgroups, probably reflecting enzymatic activity and substrate specificity. Transfection experiments and in vitro enzymatic analysis have demonstrated that β3Gn-T2, -T3, and -T4 are able to catalyze the initiation and elongation of poly-N-acetyllactosamine sugar chains; however, they exhibit different substrate specificity. These results, taken together with the different distributions of these enzymes, indicate that β3Gn-T2, -T3, and -T4 each exert distinct roles in physiological and pathological processes.DISCUSSIONIn this study, we identified three novel β1,3-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferases (β3Gn-T2, -T3, and -T4) that show structural similarity to β3Gn-T1 as well as the β3Gal-T family, including five members (β3Gal-T1, -T2, -T3, -T4, and T5), demonstrating the existence of a β3Gn-T family now consisting of four members (β3Gn-T1, -T2, -T3, and -T4). The existence of the multiple enzymes showing similar activity is a common feature of glycosyltransferases, which was demonstrated for Gal α2,3-sialyltransferases I–VI (9Sasaki K. Watanabe E.

Discovery of the β3Gn-T family in this study has clearly demonstrated a new feature of glycosyltransferases, that the β3Gn-T and β3Gal-T families show structural similarity despite of differences in both the transfer sugar (GlcNAc versus Gal) and the acceptor sugar (Galversus GlcNAc).We constructed the secreted recombinant proteins for β3Gn-T2, -T3, and -T4 fused to the FLAG peptide. Western blot analysis using anti-FLAG antibody revealed that the secreted enzymes were successfully produced by insect cells and were readily recovered by anti-FLAG M1 antibody resin. The FLAG-fused proteins adsorbed to the resin were eluted under mild conditions using buffer containing 2 mmEDTA. Since the eluted proteins showed activity comparative to that of the adsorbed proteins, it was confirmed that EDTA treatment did not damage the enzymes (data not shown). The molecular masses of the recovered proteins were equal to or larger than the predicted ones for their polypeptides, indicating some glycosylation and no significant degradation of the recovered proteins.All of the recombinant proteins showed Gal β1,3-N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase activity for common oligosaccharides, whereas their substrate preference was significantly different. Since the amount of the recombinant proteins used in this study was not enough for determination of the protein concentration, we could not precisely compare the relative activities of the enzymes. However, the relative activities of β3Gn-T2 for LNnT, lactose, Galβ1–4GlcNAc, and p-LNnH seemed to be higher than those of other enzymes (Tables III and IV). Considering the variety of acceptor substrates and the different reactivities of the transfected cells to anti-i-antigen antibody or PWM and LEA lectins, the higher activity of β3Gn-T2 for these oligosaccharides may reflect substrate specificity.To date, β3Gn-T activities have been detected in several tissues, cells, and sera, some of which were characterized using partially purified enzymes (19Holmes E.H.

Based on the substrate specificity, β3Gn-T1, but not β3Gn-T2, -T3, and -T4, may correspond to a β3Gn-T partially purified from calf serum. β3Gn-T2 and -T4 showed more preferential activity for LNnT than for LNT, which was similar to the nature of the calf serum enzyme as well as β3Gn-T1 and iGnT (7Zhou D.

Considering the substrate specificity and expression in colon tissues and Colo205 cells, β3Gn-T3 is likely to be the most probable candidate involved in the biosynthesis of the backbone structure of dimeric Lea (Galβ1–3GlcNAcβ1–3Galβ1–3GlcNAc). On the other hand, it is difficult to ascribe the β3Gn-T activities detected in crude samples to the isolated β3Gn-Ts (β3Gn-T1, -T2, -T3, and -T4 or iGnT) because of the following reasons: differences in experimental conditions such as substrates used, the possibility of the existence of multiple β3Gn-Ts in the crude samples, and the possibility of the existence of additional unidentified β3Gn-Ts.Analysis of substrate specificity revealed that β3Gn-T2, -T3, and -T4 each could be involved in the initiation and elongation of poly-N-acetyllactosamine synthesis by itself, which was demonstrated by increased expression of poly-N-acetyllactosamines in the transfected cells. The different reactivities of the respective transfectants to the anti-i-antigen antibody or LEA and PWM lectins may reflect the preference of the antibody and lectins as well as substrate specificity of these enzymes. On the other hand, expression of two or more β3Gn-Ts in the same cell, which was clearly demonstrated for Colo205 cells, indicates that poly-N-acetyllactosamine sugar chains might be synthesized by the concerted action of multiple β3Gn-Ts. Since Namalwa KJM-1 cells express endogenous β3Gn-T2, at least two β3Gn-Ts may be involved in the biosynthesis of poly-N-acetyllactosamines in the β3Gn-T3 or β3Gn-T4 transfectants.The phylogenetic analysis using the amino acid sequences of the putative catalytic domains indicated that the members of the β3Gal-T and β3Gn-T families are clustered into the following four subgroups: β3Gal-T1, -T2, -T3, and -T5; β3Gn-T2, -T3, and -T4; β3Gal-T4; and β3Gn-T1 (Fig. 1 b). Whereas β3Gal-T1, -T2, -T3, and -T5 catalyze the formation of the Galβ1–3GlcNAc structure, β3Gal-T4 forms the Galβ1–3GalNAc structure, indicating that enzymatic activity may reflect structural similarity. β3Gn-T1 was reported to have β3Gn-T activity (7Zhou D. Dinter A. Gutierrez Gallego R. Kamerling J.P. Vliegenthart J.F. Berger E.G. Hennet T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 406-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar); however, β3Gn-T2, -T3, and -T4 resemble the β3Gal-T family rather than β3Gn-T1. In addition, β3Gn-T1 is structurally distinct from the other members of the β3Gn-T and β3Gal-T families because it does not have 2 of the 3 cysteine residues conserved by all the other members. There was no direct relationship between the subgroups and chromosomal localizations of the genes (Fig. 1 B). β3Gn-T1, -T2, -T3, and -T4 exhibited no structural similarity to another type of β3Gn-T (named iGnT) that was isolated by expression cloning using the anti-i-antigen antibody, suggesting that the in vivo substrate specificity of iGnT might be quite different from that of other β3Gn-Ts.In this study, we isolated three types of novel β3Gn-T genes, which enabled us to discriminate the respective enzymes at the molecular level. Considering the enzymatic activities in vitro andin vivo as well as the expression patterns of the β3Gn-Ts, the respective enzymes are likely to play different roles. The poly-N-acetyllactosamine or GlcNAcβ1–3Gal structure appears in glycolipids, keratan sulfate proteoglycans, and human milk oligosaccharides, in addition to N- and O-glycans of glycoproteins. Therefore, the existence of multiple β3Gn-Ts is not strange. It remains to be determined which β3Gn-T make"

These anti-proliferative and differentiation promoting effects of the ECM are attributable both to its composition and three-dimensional spatial organization, as well as the presence of soluble growth inhibitors, such as TGF-β (1Boudreau N.

Compelling evidence for these effects also comes from transgenic animal studies in which altered ECM expression or organization, disruption of ECM attachments, or proteolytic modification of ECM integrity results in altered developmental and disease-related phenotypes (5Vu T.H.

The matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are a major determinant of ECM turnover in tissue morphogenesis. Altered expression of MMP activity is associated with a variety of pathologic conditions, including tumor progression and cancer invasion (5Vu T.H. Shipley J.M. Bergers G. Berger J.E. Helms J.A.

Cell. 1997; 91: 439-442Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1131) Google Scholar). In addition to disrupting the structural organization of the ECM, MMP proteolysis of ECM can result in release and/or activation of sequestered growth factors (1Boudreau N. Werb Z. Bissell M.J. Proc.

Trends Cell Biol. 1998; 8: 437-441Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar). In addition, MMP activity may expose cryptic sites in the ECM or directly modify cell surface receptors or ligands involved in both cell-matrix, as well as cell-cell adhesion (1Boudreau N. Werb Z.

The endogenous metalloproteinase inhibitors, tissue inhibitors of MMPs (TIMPs), negatively regulate the proteolytic activity of MMPs during ECM turnover. Reduction or ablation of TIMP gene expression results in enhanced ECM proteolysis concomitant with up-regulation of cell invasive activity of nontransformed differentiated cells (10Khokha R. Waterhouse P. Yagel S. Lala P.K. Overall C.M. Norton G. Denhardt D.T. Science. 1989; 243: 947-950Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar, 11Alexander C.M. Werb Z. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 118: 727-739Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). In comparison, TIMP overexpression results in decreased invasion of endothelial and tumor cells both in vitro and in vivo (12Albini A. Melchiori A. Santi L. Liotta L.A. Brown P.D. Stetler-Stevenson W.G. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1991; 83: 775-779Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar, 13DeClerck Y.A. Perez N. Shimada H. Boone T.C. Langley K.E. Taylor S.M. Cancer Res. 1992; 52: 701-708PubMed Google Scholar). Recent transgenic animal studies have demonstrated that alteration of the MMP/TIMP balance in vivo in favor of TIMP-1 activity can block neoplastic proliferation in the SV40 T antigen-induced model of murine hepatocellular carcinoma (14Martin D.C. Sanchez-Sweatman O.H. Ho A.T.V. Inderdeo D.S. Tsao M.S. Khokha R. Lab. Invest. 1999; 79: 225-234PubMed Google Scholar). The mechanism of this TIMP-1 effect was mediated by direct inhibition of MMP processing of insulin-like growth factor-binding protein-3 (IGFBP-3), thereby preventing the release of insulin-like growth factor II and thus suppressing mitogenic activity. These and other studies demonstrate that, through inhibition of MMP activity and prevention of ECM turnover, TIMPs can suppress cell proliferation, invasion and reduce metastasis formation, i.e. TIMPs act as tumor suppressors. As a result of such studies, targeting MMP activity with synthetic MMP inhibitors has become an attractive strategy for therapeutic intervention in cancer progression (15Gibbs J.B. Science. 2000; 287: 1969-1973Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar). However, recent studies suggest that TIMPs may also directly modulate cell growth in an MMP-independent fashion, although many of these studies lack detailed mechanistic insight (16Guedez L.

FEBS Lett. 1996; 396: 103-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Thus, in addition to their action as inhibitors of metalloproteinases, it is important to investigate whether TIMPs function to directly modulate cell growth and the potential mechanisms for these effects. Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is highly expressed in human cancers and is detectable at low levels in many normal tissues (21Caraglia M. Tagliaferri P. Correale P. Genua G. Pinto A. Del Vecchio S. Esposito G. Bianco A.R. Cancer Immunol. Immunother. 1993; 37: 150-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Overexpression of EGFR has been observed in a variety of human tumors, and EGF-related growth factors play a role in human cancer growth through autocrine and paracrine mechanisms (22Aaronson S. Science. 1991; 254: 1146-1153Crossref PubMed Scopus (1154) Google Scholar). Overexpression of EGFR (23DiFiore P.P. Pierce J.H. Kraus M.H. Segatto O,. King C.R. Aaronson S.A. Science. 1987; 237: 178-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (866) Google Scholar) or structural alterations in the receptor protein, such as truncation of the cytoplasmic domain, may elicit ligand-independent signaling and autonomous cell growth (24Fedi P. Tronick S.R. Aaronson S.A. Holland J.F. Bast R.C. Morton D.L. Frei E. Kufe D.W. Weichselbaum R.R. Cancer Medicine. Williams and Wilkins, Baltimore1997: 41-64Google Scholar). Ligand binding to EGFR initiates receptor dimerization, autophosphorylation of tyrosyl residues on the cytoplasmic domain of EGFR, and subsequently Src-mediated activation of the extracellular signal-regulated kinase mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase pathway (25Weiss A. Schlessinger J. Cell. 1998; 94: 277-280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar). Mitogenic signaling of the EGFR seems to critically depend on activation of the extracellular signal-regulated kinase/mitogen-activated kinase cascade. Here we study the role of TIMP-2 in the regulation of cell growth in response to tyrosine kinase-type receptor (TKR) growth factor stimulation. In addition to soluble ligand binding, membrane-anchored ligands can also stimulate TKR-mediated mitogenic responses at high cell densities or following proteolytic processing from the cell surface. Examples are the membrane-anchored EGFR ligands, which include heparin-bound epidermal growth factor, amphiregulin, transforming growth factor-α (TGF-α), and betacellulin, which are shed from the plasma membrane by proteolytic cleavage resulting in autocrine activation of the receptor (26Dong J. Opresko L.K. Dempsey P.J. Lauffenburger D.A. Coffey R.J. Wiley H.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 6235-6240Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar, 27Prenzel N. Zwick E. Daub H. Leserer M. Abraham R. Wallasch C. Ullrich A. Nature. 1999; 402: 884-888Crossref PubMed Scopus (1493) Google Scholar). Synthetic metalloproteinase inhibitors, such as BB-94 (Batimastat), reduce cell proliferation in the human mammary epithelial cell line 184A1 by blocking TGF-α release (26Dong J. Opresko L.K. Dempsey P.J. Lauffenburger D.A. Coffey R.J. Wiley H.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 6235-6240Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). BB94 also inhibits EGFR trans-activation by G-protein-coupled receptors that occurs via a metalloproteinase directed cleavage of pro-heparin-bound EGF (27Prenzel N. Zwick E. Daub H. Leserer M. Abraham R. Wallasch C. Ullrich A. Nature. 1999; 402: 884-888Crossref PubMed Scopus (1493) Google Scholar). These findings suggest that the metalloproteinase inhibitors prevent the release of membrane-anchored EGFR ligands (e.g. TGF-α, pro-heparin-bound EGF), thereby inhibiting autocrine activation of the receptor protein (26Dong J. Opresko L.K. Dempsey P.J. Lauffenburger D.A. Coffey R.J. Wiley H.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 6235-6240Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). However, if soluble ligands that do not require metalloproteinase processing (e.g. EGF) are present, BB-94 did not inhibit the mitogenic response in these experiments (26Dong J. Opresko L.K. Dempsey P.J. Lauffenburger D.A. Coffey R.J. Wiley H.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 6235-6240Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Thus we have focused our experiments on TIMP inhibition of cellular responses to soluble mitogenic factors, in particular EGF. We have examined the direct modulation of TKR growth factor-stimulated proliferation of human, A549 lung carcinoma, MCF7 mammary carcinoma, HT1080 fibrosarcoma, and Hs68 dermal fibroblast cells using both wild type TIMP-2 (wt-TIMP-2) and a null-inhibitor form of TIMP-2, Ala+TIMP-2. Both forms of TIMP-2 abrogate the TKR-mediated mitogenic responses in these cells. We also investigated the mechanism of the diminished mitogenic response following TIMP-2 pretreatment prior to growth factor stimulation. The results demonstrate that these suppressive effects are mediated by disruption of TKR activation proximal to the extracellular signal-regulated kinase pathway. To our knowledge this is the first demonstration that TIMP-2 can directly suppress activation of a mitogenic response through suppression of TKR activation in an MMP-independent fashion. Recombinant human EGF, PDGF, and bFGF were obtained from R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN. The following commercially available antibodies were obtained: human anti-EGFR, clone 528, mouse, monoclonal IgG2a (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA); human anti-phosphotyrosine, clone PY-20, mouse IgG2b, monoclonal, (Transduction Labs, Lexington, KY); human anti-MT-1-MMP, clone 113-5B7 or 114-6G6 (catalytic), mouse, monoclonal (Chemicon International, Temecula, CA), human anti-Grb2, clone C-23, rabbit, polyclonal, (Santa Cruz, Santa Cruz, CA); human anti-SH-PTP1, clone C-19, rabbit, polyclonal (Santa Cruz Biotechnology); human anti-SH-PTP2, clone C-18, rabbit, polyclonal (Santa Cruz Biotechnology); mouse and rabbit IgG-horseradish peroxidase conjugate, (Santa Cruz); and goat anti-mouse IgG (H+L) (Kirkegaard & Perry, Gaithersburg, MD). MMP synthetic hydroxamate inhibitor, BB-94, was a gift from British Biotechnology, Ltd. (Oxford, United Kingdom). Adenylate cyclase inhibitor, SQ22536, and PKA inhibitor, H89 were purchased from Calbiochem (La Jolla, CA). The recombinant MT-1-MMP catalytic domain (150 units/mg) was purchased from Chemicon International and metalloproteinase activity was determined by the thiopeptolide assay as described previously (28Wingfield P.T.

RIPA buffer consists of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, and 0.1% SDS. The rTIMP-2 protein was expressed using a vaccinia virus expression system and purified as described (29Fridman R. Fuerst T.R. Bird R.E. Hoyhtya M. Oelkuct M. Kraus S. Komarek D. Liotta L.A.

TIMP-2 and Ala+TIMP-2 were purified by gel filtration in 4 m guanidine HCl, folded, and oxidized, and then purified by gel filtration under native conditions. Recombinant TIMP-1 was isolated from the conditioned medium of EPA-transfected Chinese hamster ovary cells (8/8 2G EPA2) (Genetics Institute, Cambridge, MA) as described (30Welgus H.G. Jeffery J.J. Stricklin G.P. Eisen A.Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 11534-11539Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and then purified by high performance liquid chromatography gel permeation chromatography using 50 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.5. All TIMP preparations were endotoxin tested using the Limulus amoebocyte lysis assay and found to contain less than 2 EU/mg of protein. Human lung adenocarcinoma cells (A549; ATCC CCL 185), human fibrosarcoma cells (HT1080; ATCC CCL 121), human breast adenocarcinoma (MCF7; ATCC HTB 22), and human dermal fibroblasts (Hs68; ATCC CRL 1635) were obtained from American Tissue Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). Cells were grown to 80% confluence in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's media (DMEM; Life Technologies Inc.) containing 4500 mg/liter of d-glucose,d-glutamine, sodium pyruvate, 100 units/ml penicillin-G, 100 μg/ml streptomycin sulfate, and 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, unless otherwise indicated. Cells were trypsinized using trypsin-EDTA (Life Technologies, Inc., Bethesda, MD). A549, Hs68, HT1080, and MCF7 cells were plated at 5 × 105 cells/well on a 96-well Costar plate for 18 h in DMEM with 10% fetal bovine serum. The cells were then starved for 18 h in DMEM without serum to synchronize cells in G1 (or G0) phase of the cell cycle. Fresh serum-free DMEM was added to the wells prior to treatment with TIMP-2. Cells were routinely incubated with TIMP-2 at the indicated concentrations for 30 min, followed by incubation in DMEM with or without EGF (100 ng/ml, R & D Systems), bFGF (50 ng/ml, R & D Systems), or PDGF (50 ng/ml, R & D Systems) and incubated for 24 h. TIMP-2 pretreatment could be reduced to 1 min prior to addition of growth factor without loss of an effect on growth factor stimulation. Following growth factor stimulation, the cells were incubated for 1 h with the CellTiter 96TM AQueous One Solution reagent (Promega, Madison, WI) containing 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfo-phenyl)-2H-tetrazolium, inner salt, and phenazine ethosulfate. The quantity of formazan product was determined by the 490 nm absorbance, and was directly proportional to the number of living cells in culture. The mean and S.D. for triplicate determinations were recorded for all incubation conditions. Alternatively, the mitogenic response to growth factor stimulation with and without TIMP-2 pretreatment was quantitated by [3H]thymidine incorporation assays. Cells were synchronized in serum-free conditions and treated with TIMP-2 and growth factors as described above. Following growth factor treatment [3H]thymidine (0.1 μCi/ml; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was added and incubated for 2 h at 37 °C. The percentage of thymidine incorporated in a 2-h pulse correlated in a linear fashion with the cell number. The culture medium was subsequently discarded, the wells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and the cells were fixed in methanol:glacial acetic acid (3:1). The incorporated [3H]thymidine was extracted as described previously and quantitated by liquid scintillation counting (31Murphy A.N. Unsworth E.J. Stetler-Stevenson W.G. J. Cell. Physiol. 1993; 157: 351-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). The mean and S.D. of triplicate assays were determined for all incubation conditions. SQ22536 or 9-(tetrahydro-2-furyl)adenine (Calbiochem/Novabiochem) was solubilized in sterile deionized H2O and added to cells at a final concentration of 100 μm (32Fabbri E. Brighenti L. Ottolenghi C. J. Enzym. Inhib. 1991; 5: 87-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). H-89 was dissolved in sterile, deionized H2O and added to give a final concentration of 0.1 μm (33Chijiwa T. Mishima A. Hagiwara M. Sano M. Hayashi K. Inoue T. Naito K. Toshioka T. Hidaka H. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 5267-5272Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The results of the growth assays are presented as the percentage of maximal growth factor response for the mitogen being tested after correcting for nonstimulated growth in basal medium. This allows comparison of the effects of TIMP-2 or Ala+TIMP-2 on the mitogenic response to various growth factors, as well as between cell lines. HT1080, Hs68, A549, or MCF7 cells were grown in a 6-well Costar plate, pretreated with TIMP-2 or Ala+TIMP, followed by growth factors (described above). Following incubation with growth factor for 5 min, 37 °C, cells were washed with PBS and treated for 10 min at 4 °C with RIPA lysis buffer containing freshly added protease inhibitors (10 μg/ml aprotinin, 30 μg/ml 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride, and 100 μm sodium orthovanadate). Cells were disrupted by repeated aspiration through a 21-gauge needle. Cell lysates were pre-cleared with normal mouse-IgG and Protein A/G (Pierce, Rockford, IL), and the supernatants were then incubated with anti-EGFR monoclonal antibodies (clone LA22, Upstate Biotech, Lake Placid, New York) at 4 °C, 1 h. Immune complexes were precipitated with Protein A/G-agarose and washed extensively with RIPA buffer, 4 °C. Immunoprecipitated EGFR was resolved by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (NOVEX, San Diego, CA) using a blotting apparatus (Bio-Rad). Tyrosine phosphorylation of the EGFR was visualized by incubating the membrane with anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies (primary), followed by anti-mouse IgG horseradish peroxidase antibodies (secondary), and detection using the ECL system (DuPont Renaissance, PerkinElmer Life Science, Boston, MA). Total EGFR (loading control) or Grb2 was visualized by incubating the membrane with stripping buffer (2% SDS, 62.5 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.4, 100 mm β-mercaptoethanol) for 2 h, 23 °C, followed by extensive washing (0.05% Tween 20 in PBS) and blocking (0.25% nonfat milk, 0.12% Tween 20, SSC). The membrane was incubated with anti-EGFR (primary), or anti-GRB-2 (primary) antibody, followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody and ECL development, as above. A549 cell monolayers were washed with PBS, trypsinized off the tissue culture, and resuspended in DMEM to give a suspension of 1 × 106cells/ml. Cells were equilibrated in DMEM containing 10% fetal calf serum for 1 h, 23 °C, followed by washing with PBS (3 times). TIMP-2, Ala+TIMP-2 ± EGF (unlabeled) was added to cell suspensions, in binding buffer (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), followed by addition of 125I-EGF (100 μCi/ml, >75 Ci/mmol, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and incubated for 3 h, 4 °C. The cells were diluted in ice-cold binding buffer, collected by gentle centrifugation (<1000 × g), and washed three times with cold PBS. EGF bound to the A549 cells was determined by γ counting (cpm) on a Packard, Cobra auto-γ-counter (Canberra Co., Downes Grove, IL). TIMP-2 and Ala+TIMP-2 were labeled with BODIPY-Fl by addition of three molar equivalents (total) of BODIPY-Fl (Molecular Probes) in three batches over 2 h, 23 °C. This labeling reaction was protected from light by covering the reaction vessel with aluminum foil. The reaction was quenched by addition of 1.5 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, to give a final concentration of 50 mm Tris-HCl. The crude reaction mixture was then passed over a Superose 6 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) gel filtration column using 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl as eluate. The BODIPY-labeled TIMP-2 or Ala+TIMP-2 containing peaks were collected and the degree of labeling was calculated by determining the ratio of absorbance at 450 nm/280 nm. An optimum value between 0.3 and 0.7 was obtained for these labeling reactions. Binding assays of BODIPY-labeled TIMP-2 to A549 and MCF7 cells were performed in triplicate as follows. Cells were grown to 80% confluence in DMEM containing 10% fetal calf serum, in white-walled, clear-bottom 96-well Costar plates. Cells were washed with PBS and pretreated to dissociate preformed ligand-receptor complexes with 3 mglycine buffer in 0.9% saline, pH 3.0, for 3 min. The cells were again washed in PBS prior to addition of TIMP-2-BODIPY in PBS containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin for 1 h, 37 °C. The supernatant was removed from cells and placed into empty wells for determination of unbound TIMP-2-BODIPY. Cell monolayers were washed three times with ice-cold (4 °C) PBS containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin. Amounts of bound TIMP-2-BODIPY were analyzed using a plate reader (PerkinElmer Life Sciences HTS7000), and measuring fluorescence from each well (λ excitation = 494 nm and λ emission = 520 nm). Specific binding was calculated as the difference between bound BODIPY-TIMP-2 in the presence or absence of excess (100-fold) unlabeled ligand. Scatchard analysis of TIMP-2 binding was performed as previously reported (35Emmert-Buck M.R. Emonard H.P. Corcoran M.L. Krutzsch H.C. Foidart J.M. Stetler-Stevenson W.G. FEBS Lett. 1995; 364: 28-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). A549 and MCF7 cells were plated at a range of 1–3 × 105 cells/ml in a Lab-Tek chambered glass slide (Nalgene). The growth medium was discarded and cells were washed with PBS. Nonspecific binding was blocked using 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin (fatty acid-free), for 1 h. Cell were washed with PBS 3 times and incubated with BODIPY-labeled TIMP-2 or Ala+TIMP-2, for 30 min, 37 °C. Following incubation with BODIPY-labeled TIMP-2, the cells were washed with PBS 5 times and fixed in paraformaldehyde. For double staining experiments cells were first incubated with BODIPY-labeled TIMP-2, washed, and fixed as described above. These cells were then incubated with the appropriate primary antibody for 1 h, followed by washing with PBS, prior to incubation with secondary rhodamine-conjugated antibody for 45 min, 23 °C. Following this secondary antibody incubation the cells were washed three times with PBS and fixed as before. Two drops of Vectashield Mounting Medium (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) containing DAPI (for nuclear counter staining) were added prior to coverslipping. Cell associated BODIPY-labeled TIMP-2 or Ala+TIMP-2, as well as anti-MT-1-MMP antibody staining was localized using confocal laser microscopy. All preparations were examined with a Leica confocal microscope, model TCS4D/DMIRBE, equipped with argon and argon-krypton lasers. Cells were originally photographed at × 80 magnification. Protein-tyrosine phosphatase activities were assayed following immunoprecipitation of either SHP-1 (clone C-19, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or SHP-2 (clone N-16, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) utilizing selective antibodies. Phosphotyrosine phosphatase activity of the immunoprecipitates was measured as the amount of phosphotyrosine content remaining after addition of known amounts of phosphotyrosine-containing peptide substrates, (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Hs68 or A549 cells were plated on 75-cm2 Nunc flasks (2 × 106/flask). Cells were preincubated with TIMP-2, followed by stimulation with growth factor (described above). Cells were harvested in lysis buffer containing 10 mm MOPS, pH 6, 5 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, 10 mmNaF, 25 mm glycerol phosphate, 10 μg/ml 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride, and 30 μg/ml aprotinin at 4 °C for 10 min. The relative protein concentrations were determined using the BCA assay (Pierce). Equal amount of protein (200 μg) were immunoprecipitated with anti-SHP-1 or SHP-2 antibodies (Transduction Labs) at 4 °C for 1 h, followed by incubation with anti-mouse agarose beads (Cappel) for 1 h. The beads were subsequently washed 3 times with lysis buffer (without orthovanadate), and 3 times with phosphatase assay buffer. The immunoprecipitates were resuspended in assay buffer and the reaction initiated by addition of phosphotyrosine peptides (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The optical densities were measured at 405 nm. Data was normalized to blank assay values and plotted as relative OD units of phosphotyrosine. Enhanced phosphatase activity is represented by a decrease in phosphotyrosine levels. Previous reports have shown that TIMP-2 and Ala+TIMP-2 can stimulate the growth of quiescent (serum starved) cells in culture (28Wingfield P.T. Sa"
https://openalex.org/W1985800571,"5-Lipoxygenase is the key enzyme in the formation of leukotrienes, which are potent lipid mediators of asthma pathophysiology. This enzyme translocates to the nuclear envelope in a calcium-dependent manner for leukotriene biosynthesis. Eight green fluorescent protein (GFP)-lipoxygenase constructs, representing the major human and mouse enzymes within this family, were constructed and their cDNAs transfected into human embryonic kidney 293 cells. Of these eight lipoxygenases, only the 5-lipoxygenase was clearly nuclear localized and translocated to the nuclear envelope upon stimulation with the calcium ionophore A23187. The N-terminal ""β -barrel"" domain of 5-lipoxygenase, but not the catalytic domain, was necessary and sufficient for nuclear envelope translocation. The GFP-N-terminal 5-lipoxygenase domain translocated faster than GFP-5-lipoxygenase. β-Barrel/catalytic domain chimeras with 12- and 15-lipoxygenase indicated that only the N-terminal domain of 5-lipoxygenase could carry out this translocation function. Mutations of iron atom binding ligands (His550 or deletion of C-terminal isoleucine) that disrupt nuclear localization do not alter translocation capacity indicating distinct determinants of nuclear localization and translocation. Moreover, data show that GFP-5-lipoxygenase β-barrel containing constructs can translocate to the nuclear membrane whether cytoplasmic or nuclear localized. Thus, the predicted β-barrel domain of 5-lipoxygenase may function like the C2 domain within protein kinase C and cytosolic phospholipase A<sub>2</sub> with unique determinants that direct its localization to the nuclear envelope."
https://openalex.org/W1995806196,"The MAPK cascades regulate a wide variety of cellular functions, including cell proliferation, differentiation, and stress responses. Here we have identified a novel MAP kinase kinase kinase (MAPKKK), termed MLTK (for MLK-like mitogen-activated protein triple kinase), whose expression is increased by activation of the ERK/MAPK pathway. There are two alternatively spliced forms of MLTK, MLTKα and MLTKβ. When overexpressed in cells, both MLTKα and MLTKβ are able to activate the ERK, JNK/SAPK, p38, and ERK5 pathways. Moreover, both MLTKα and MLTKβ are activated in response to osmotic shock with hyperosmolar media through autophosphorylation. Remarkably, expression of MLTKα, but not MLTKβ, in Swiss 3T3 cells results in the disruption of actin stress fibers and dramatic morphological changes. A kinase-dead form of MLTKα does not cause these phenomena. Inhibition of the p38 pathway significantly blocks MLTKα-induced stress fiber disruption and morphological changes. These results suggest that MLTK is a stress-activated MAPKKK that may be involved in the regulation of actin organization.

So far, at least four independent MAPK pathways have been identified. They include the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) pathway, the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK)/stress-activated protein kinase (SAPK) pathway, the p38 pathway, and the ERK5/Big MAPK1 (BMK1) pathway. The ERK pathway regulates cell proliferation, cell differentiation, and developmental processes (3Treisman R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 205-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (1165) Google Scholar, 6Nishida E. Gotoh Y. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1993; 18: 128-131Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (964) Google Scholar). The JNK/SAPK and p38 pathways are involved in cellular stress responses and apoptosis (7Kyriakis J.M. Avruch J. Bioessays. 1996; 18: 567-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (661) Google Scholar, 8Robinson M.J. Cobb M.H. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 180-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (2286) Google Scholar). The ERK5/BMK1 pathway has been reported to participate in EGF (epidermal growthfactor)-stimulated growth control (9Kato Y. Tapping R.I. Huang S. Watson M.H. Ulevitch R.J. Lee J.D. Nature. 1998; 395: 713-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar, 10Kamakura S. Moriguchi T. Nishida E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26563-26571Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar). These MAPKs are activated through phosphorylation of threonine and tyrosine residues by MAPK kinases (MAPKKs or MAPK/ERK kinases (MEKs)), which include MAPKK1/MEK1 and MAPKK2/MEK2 as ERK activators, SEK1/MKK4 and MKK7 as JNK/SAPK activators, MKK3 and MKK6 as p38 activators, and MEK5 as an ERK5 activator (8Robinson M.J. Cobb M.H. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 180-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (2286) Google Scholar, 11Schaeffer H.J. Weber M.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 2435-2444Crossref PubMed Scopus (1407) Google Scholar). The substrate specificity of MAPKKs for MAPKs is relatively strict, and these MAPKK/MAPK cascades function as independent signaling units. MAPKK kinases (MAPKKKs) are a family of serine/threonine protein kinases that can activate one or several of the MAPKK/MAPK cascades (8Robinson M.J. Cobb M.H. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 180-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (2286) Google Scholar). MAPKKKs phosphorylate two serine/threonine residues in the activation phosphorylation sites of MAPKKs. The identified MAPKKKs include the Raf family, the MEK kinase (MEKK) family, and the mixed-lineage kinase (MLK) family. The Raf family kinases selectively activate the ERK pathway. On the other hand, MEKK1, MEKK2, and MEKK3 activate both the ERK pathway and the JNK/SAPK pathway (12Schlesinger T.K. Fanger G.R. Yujiri T. Johnson G.L. Front. Biosci. 1998; 3: D1181-D1186Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). MLK3, MUK, TAK1, and ASK1 activate the JNK/SAPK and p38 pathways (8Robinson M.J. Cobb M.H. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 180-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (2286) Google Scholar). Recently, Cot/Tpl-2 was reported to activate all known MAPK pathways: the ERK, JNK/SAPK, p38 (p38γ isoform), and ERK5/BMK1 pathways (13Chiariello M. Marinissen M.J. Gutkind J.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1747-1758Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Some of the MAPKKKs were shown to be activated by particular extracellular stimuli. For example, Raf-1 is activated by mitogens and phorbol esters, TAK1 by transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) and cytokines (14Yamaguchi K. Shirakabe K. Shibuya H. Irie K. Oishi I. Ueno N. Taniguchi T. Nishida E. Matsumoto K. Science. 1995; 270: 2008-2011Crossref PubMed Scopus (1178) Google Scholar, 15Shirakabe K. Yamaguchi K. Shibuya H. Irie K. Matsuda S. Moriguchi T. Gotoh Y. Matsumoto K. Nishida E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8141-8144Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar), and ASK1 by tumor necrosis factor-α (TNFα) (16Ichijo H. Nishida E. Irie K. ten Dijke P. Saitoh M. Moriguchi T. Takagi M. Matsumoto K. Miyazono K. Gotoh Y. Science. 1997; 275: 90-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (2037) Google Scholar). Thus, various MAPKKKs appear to respond to a variety of extracellular stimuli and activate a limited number of the MAPKK/MAPK cascades. Actin reorganization underlies changes in cell morphology and is essential for cell migration and motility. The Rho family GTPases are known to regulate particular types of actin reorganization (17Van Aelst L. D'Souza-Schorey C. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2295-2322Crossref PubMed Scopus (2101) Google Scholar, 18Hall A. Science. 1998; 279: 509-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (5230) Google Scholar). Rho and Rac promote stress fiber formation and membrane ruffling, respectively (19Ridley A.J. Hall A. Cell. 1992; 70: 389-399Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3843) Google Scholar, 20Ridley A.J. Paterson H.F. Johnston C.L. Diekmann D. Hall A. Cell. 1992; 70: 401-410Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3084) Google Scholar). Their effects on the actin cytoskeleton are at least partially mediated by protein kinases such as p160 Rho kinase and p21-activated protein kinase (17Van Aelst L. D'Souza-Schorey C. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2295-2322Crossref PubMed Scopus (2101) Google Scholar), which are reported to affect actin dynamics through regulation of the phosphorylation state of myosin light chain. However, there is no MAPKKK that has been shown to participate in actin reorganization. In this study, we have identified a novel MAPKKK, designated MLTK forMLK-like mitogen-activated proteintriple kinase, whose expression is up-regulated by activation of the ERK pathway in Swiss 3T3 cells. We show that MLTK can be activated by osmotic shock with hyperosmolar media and induce the disruption of actin stress fibers and dramatic changes in cell morphology. Swiss 3T3 cells were stably transfected, first with p3′SS (Stratagene) and then with HA-LASDSE MEK1 (21Fukuda M. Gotoh I. Adachi M. Gotoh Y. Nishida E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32642-32648Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar) subcloned into pOPI3 (Stratagene). Clones were selected using hygromycin B (200 μg/ml; Life Technologies, Inc.) and Geneticin (400 μg/ml; Life Technologies, Inc.) as the selection drugs. A clone (3L-9) that showed a high inducibility of MEK1 was obtained and used for the experiment. 5 mm IPTG was added to the medium to induce MEK1 expression (LacSwich system, Stratagene). cDNA subtraction was performed using a PCR-Selected cDNA Subtraction kit (CLONTECH). The mRNA from untreated 3L-9 was used as the “driver.” The mRNA from 3L-9 cultured for 6 h after the addition of IPTG and that from 3L-9 cultured for 18 h were mixed, and the mixture was used as the “tester.” The subtractive screening was carried out according to the manufacturer's instructions. A 1022-base pair fragment of MLTK was obtained as a candidate positive cDNA clone. 5′- and 3′-RACE analyses for the cDNA fragment obtained were performed using mouse heart Marathon Ready cDNA (CLONTECH) as a template. The internal primers used were 5′-GTCCTGTGATATCCATTTGGCTC-3′ (antisense for 5′-RACE) and 5′-CGGGAGAGACGTCTCAAGATGTGGG-3′ (sense for 3′-RACE). Each RACE product was cloned into pCR2.1-TOPO (Invitrogen) and sequenced with an ABI 377 sequencer. Full-length mouse MLTKα and MLTKβ were obtained by PCR using mouse heart Marathon Ready cDNA (CLONTECH) as a template. Full-length mouse MLTKα and MLTKβ with Bam HI sites at both ends of the cDNA were cloned into pSRα-HA. For human MLTKs, a human expressed sequence tag data base was searched using the mouse MLTK sequence obtained in the subtraction. Based on the corresponding human sequence, RACE analyses and full-length cloning were done using a Superscript human fetal brain cDNA library (Life Technologies, Inc.) as a template for PCR. A kinase-negative form of MLTK was produced using a QuickChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) with the mutagenic primers 5′-GGACAAGGAGGTGGCTGTAATGAAGTTACTCAAAATAGAG-3′ (sense) and 5′-CTCTATTTTGAGTAACTTCATTACAGCCACCTCCTTGTCC-3′ (antisense) (the mutated bases are underlined) by PCR and cloned into pSRα-HA and pSRα-Myc. Expression vectors of the dominant-negative form of MAPKKs are described elsewhere (MEK1-SASA (22Adachi M. Fukuda M. Nishida E.

Expression vectors of HA-ASK1 and HA-ΔN-TAK1 are described previously (14Yamaguchi K. Shirakabe K. Shibuya H. Irie K. Oishi I. Ueno N. Taniguchi T. Nishida E. Matsumoto K.

COS-7 and Swiss 3T3 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and antibiotics (100 units/ml penicillin and 0.2 mg/ml kanamycin). Transfection of the expression vectors was performed using LipofectAMINE and LipofectAMINE PLUS (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Transfected COS-7 cells were lysed in extraction buffer (20 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 1% Triton X-100, 5 mm EGTA, 12 mm β-glycerophosphate, 5 mm NaF, 1 mm sodium PPi, 1 mm Na2VO3, 2 mmdithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0.5% aprotinin). Cell lysates were subjected to immunoblotting using mouse monoclonal anti-HA antibody (12CA5), rabbit anti-HA antibody (Y-11, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), mouse monoclonal anti-Myc antibody (9E10, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), rabbit anti-Myc antibody (A-14, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), mouse anti-phosphorylated ERK antibody (E10, New England Biolabs Inc.), rabbit anti-phosphorylated JNK antibody (New England Biolabs Inc.), and rabbit anti-phosphorylated p38 antibody (New England Biolabs Inc.) as the primary antibodies. The reacted antibodies were detected by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies, followed by visualization using an ECL chemiluminescence kit (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). COS-7 cells transfected with HA-MLTKα or HA-MLTKβ were exposed to the various stimuli for 10 min. Cells were lysed, and HA-MLTKs were immunoprecipitated by anti-HA antibody 12CA5 (3 μg/300 μl of lysate) at 4 °C for 2 h. The precipitates were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.4) containing 0.05% Tween 20 and added to 15 μl of kinase reaction buffer (20 mmTris (pH 7.5), 10 mm MgCl2, 100 μm ATP, and 2 μCi [γ-32P]ATP) containing 5 μg of His-tagged MKK6 generated in Escherichia coli. The mixtures were incubated at 25 °C for 5 min and stopped by adding SDS sample buffer. Samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE, and 32P incorporated into His-MKK6 was detected by autoradiography. A portion of each precipitate was subjected to immunoblotting using anti-HA antibody. For the coupled kinase assay, the immunoprecipitates were first incubated with His-MEK1, His-SEK1, or His-MKK6 recombinant protein (0.2 μg each/reaction) (26Gotoh Y. Matsuda S. Takenaka K. Hattori S. Iwamatsu A. Ishikawa M. Kosako H. Nishida E. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 1891-1898PubMed Google Scholar) at 30 °C for 15 min in kinase reaction buffer without the radiolabeled ATP. The reactions were then added with the kinase-negative form of GST-ERK, GST-SAPK, or GST-p38 (27Moriguchi T. Kawasaki H. Matsuda S. Gotoh Y. Nishida E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12969-12972Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar) together with 2 μCi of [γ-32P] ATP and further incubated at 30 °C for 7 min. The reactions were stopped by adding SDS sample buffer, and 32P incorporated into each MAPK protein was detected by autoradiography. Coimmunoprecipitation assay for detecting dimerization of MLTK was performed essentially as described (28Leung I.W. Lassam N. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32408-32415Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar) using lysis buffer containing 50 mm Hepes (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 10% glycerol, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 10 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm NaF, 1 mm Na2VO3, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1% aprotinin. Cells were fixed and permeabilized as described previously (22Adachi M. Fukuda M. Nishida E. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5347-5358Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). HA-tagged proteins were detected with anti-HA antibody 12CA5. Actin filaments were visualized using tetramethylrhodamine B isothiocyanate (TRITC)- or fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-labeled phalloidin. Fluorescence images were observed using a Zeiss Axiophoto or a confocal microscope (Bio-Rad). To isolate genes whose expression is increased after activation of the ERK/MAPK pathway, we established a stable Swiss 3T3 cell line in which expression of an active MEK1 mutant, LASDSE MEK1 (21Fukuda M. Gotoh I. Adachi M. Gotoh Y. Nishida E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32642-32648Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar), was induced by the addition of IPTG to the culture medium (Fig.1 A, upper). In one such cell line (clone 3L-9), expression of LASDSE MEK1 induced by IPTG treatment caused morphological transformation of the cells (Fig.1 A, lower). We performed a subtractive cDNA screening using mRNAs from untreated and IPTG-treated 3L-9 cells. Among the isolated cDNA clones, we found a cDNA fragment that encodes a novel protein kinase that appears to be a member of the MAPKKK family. RT-PCR analysis revealed that the corresponding mRNA existed in unstimulated cells and was being up-regulated at least 18 h after the induction of active MEK1 (Fig. 1 B). Northern blot analysis of the cDNA fragment obtained showed that the transcript (∼7.7 kilobases) was expressed ubiquitously, with higher expression levels in heart and skeletal muscle (Fig.2 D). There were two minor bands of ∼3.3 and 1.6 kilobases in human heart and skeletal muscle (Fig. 2 D).Figure 2Cloning of MLTK. A, sequences of mouse MLTKα and MLTKβ. The cDNA sequences of MLTKα and MLTKβ and the predicted amino acid sequences are shown. Nucleotides 1–1025 of MLTKα are identical to those of MLTKβ. The fragment obtained in the subtraction corresponds to nucleotides 2–1023.

The kinase domain shows the highest homology to that of MLK2 with 44.7% identity and is 32.7% identical to that of TAK1 (Fig. 2 C). Thus, we termed this kinase MLTK for MLK-like mitogen-activated protein triple kinase. The two isoforms, designated MLTKα and MLTKβ, respectively, may be alternatively spliced forms. The C-terminal region of MLTKβ (residues 268–395) shows homology to the C-terminal region of TAK1 (42.5% identity). The C-terminal region of MLTKα has a sterile α-motif that has been shown to be involved in the protein-protein interactions and dimer formation of several signaling molecules and transcription regulators (29Ponting C.P. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 1928-1930Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). The calculated molecular masses of MLTKα and MLTKβ are 91.7 and 51.3 kDa, respectively. Each MLTK contains two putative nuclear export signal (NES)-like sequences, which are characterized by four hydrophobic residues with appropriate spacing (Fig. 2 E, upper). We expressed HA-tagged MLTKα and MLTKβ in COS-7 cells and determined their subcellular localization. Both HA-MLTKα and HA-MLTKβ were present mainly in the cytoplasm (Fig. 2 E, lower). When the cells were treated with leptomycin B, which inhibits the function of CRM1, an NES receptor, HA-MLTKβ accumulated in the nuclei (Fig. 2 E, lower). HA-MLTKα also tended to appear in the nucleus after leptomycin B treatment, but nuclear accumulation of HA-MLTKα was observed in ∼10% of the expressing cells (Fig. 2 E, lower). These results suggest that the cytoplasmic localization of both MLTKα and MLTKβ may be maintained by their NESs and that both molecules may be shuttling between the nucleus and the cytoplasm. However, we could not detect significant changes in the subcellular distribution of MLTKα or MLTKβ after activation of these kinases by stimulation with osmotic shock (data not shown; see below). We examined whether MLTKα and MLTKβ could activate the MAPK pathways in cotransfection assays in COS-7 cells. Both MLTKα and MLTKβ activated any of the four coexpressed MAPKs: ERK2, JNK/SAPK (SAPKα), p38 (p38α), and ERK5/BMK1 (Fig.3 A). When MAPKKs were cotransfected with MLTKs, MEK1, SEK1, MKK7, MKK3, and MKK6 were activated markedly by either of the MLTKs (Fig. 3 B and data not shown). In in vitro coupled kinase assays, both MLTKα and MLTKβ activated MEK1, SEK1, and MKK6 directly, although MLTKα was slightly stronger than MLTKβ in activating SEK1 and MKK6 (Fig.3 C). These results suggest that both MLTKs can activate all known MAPK pathways by phosphorylating and activating the respective MAPKKs. Thus, both MLTKα and MLTKβ are members of the MAPKKK family. We then examined whether the activity of MLTK was up-regulated by extracellular stimuli. COS-7 cells were transfected with HA-MLTKα and exposed to various stimuli for 10 min. HA-MLTKα was then immunoprecipitated and subjected to the in vitro kinase assay using His-MKK6 as an exogenous substrate. MLTKα had a relatively high activity when overexpressed in the cells (Fig.4 A). Treatment with fetal calf serum (15%), insulin (5 μg/ml), TGF-β (20 ng/ml), 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (100 ng/ml), lysophosphatidic acid (100 ng/ml), UV (80 J/m2), and anisomycin (100 μg/ml) did not activate MLTKα (Fig. 4 A) or MLTKβ (data not shown). On the other hand, treatment with NaCl (0.5 m) significantly activated MLTKα (Fig. 4,A and B) and MLTKβ (data not shown). The NaCl treatment caused a slight mobility retardation of MLTKα in SDS-PAGE (Fig. 4 A). Treatment with sorbitol (0.5 m) or KCl (0.5 m) as well as NaCl (0.5 m) also caused a mobility shift of MLTKα and MLTKβ (Fig. 4 B,lower) and induced an increase in their kinase activity (the activity of MLTKα for MKK6 and the autophosphorylation activity of MLTKβ) (Fig. 4 B, upper). The in vitro treatment of immunoprecipitated HA-MLTKα with calf intestine alkaline phosphatase increased its mobility in SDS-PAGE and decreased its kinase activity (Fig. 4 C). Thus, the mobility retardation correlates with the kinase activity of MLTK. We then produced and expressed kinase-negative mutants of MLTK, MLTKα-KM and MLTKβ-KM, in which Lys45 was replaced by Met. COS-7 cells were transfected with each HA-tagged form of the MLTKs and either left untreated or stimulated by osmotic shock (0.5m NaCl). No kinase activity for MKK6 was detected in MLTKα-KM and MLTKβ-KM. Moreover, although a clear mobility shift in SDS-PAGE was seen in wild-type MLTKα and wild-type MLTKβ in response to osmotic shock, no mobility shift took place in the case of MLTKα-KM and MLTKβ-KM (Fig. 4 B, left), indicating that the stimulus-dependent mobility shift of MLTK is caused by autophosphorylation. It was confirmed that MLTKα-KM and MLTKβ-KM cannot activate any of the coexpressed MAPKs (Fig.4 D, right; and data not shown). Taken together, these results suggest that both MLTKα and MLTKβ are activated through autophosphorylation in response to osmotic stress with hyperosmolar media. It has been reported that autophosphorylation of MEKK1, TAK1, or Ssk2 is achieved through an intramolecular reaction (30Deak J.C. Templeton D.J. Biochem. J. 1997; 322: 185-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 31Kishimoto K. Matsumoto K. Ninomiya-Tsuji J. J. Biol.

To examine whether the autophosphorylation of MLTK occurs through an inter- or intramolecular reaction, we tested if the autophosphorylation occurs between two isoforms of MLTK. COS-7 cells were transfected with HA-tagged MLTKs and either left untreated or stimulated by osmotic shock (0.5 m NaCl). Both wild-type MLTKα and wild-type MLTKβ showed a mobility shift in SDS-PAGE in response to osmotic shock (Fig. 5, first throughsixth lanes), whereas MLTKα-KM and MLTKβ-KM did not (eleventh and twelfth lanes). When MLTKα-KM was coexpressed with wild-type MLTKβ, however, MLTKα-KM showed a relatively weak but significant mobility shift in response to osmotic shock (Fig. 5, ninth and tenth lanes). In contrast, MLTKβ-KM did not show a mobility shift in response to osmotic shock when coexpressed with wild-type MLTKα (Fig. 5,seventh and eighth lanes). Therefore, part of the autophosphorylation of MLTKα, but not MLTKβ, may be achieved through an intermolecular reaction. The stimulus-dependent mobility shift of kinase-negative MLTKα seems not to be complete compared with wild-type MLTKα, suggesting that both inter- and intramolecular reactions contribute to the full autophosphorylation of MLTKα in response to osmotic shock. The autophosphorylation of MLTKβ may occur through an intramolecular reaction. We examined the effect of MLTK expression on cell morphology and the cytoskeleton. HA-MLTKα or HA-MLTKβ was expressed in Swiss 3T3 cells, and actin filaments were"

The activity of the single channels in excised patches could be modulated by Ca2+, Mg2+, and pH. The maximal activation of these channels by divalent cation-free conditions occurred independently of depletion of intracellular Ca2+stores, whether in excised patches or in whole cell mode. Yet, a number of points of evidence establish these single-channel openings as amplified store-operated channel events. Specifically, (i) the single channels are exquisitely sensitive to inhibition by intracellular Ca2+, and (ii) both the store-operated current and the single-channel openings are completely blocked by the capacitative calcium entry blocker, 2-aminoethoxydiphenyl borane. In addition, in Jurkat T cells single-channel openings with lower open probability have been observed in the whole cell mode with intracellular Mg2+ present (Kerschbaum, H. H., and Cahalan, M. D.

Receptor-mediated release of Ca2+ from IP31-sensitive intracellular stores triggers an influx of Ca2+ into the cell via store-operated channels (SOCs) in the plasma membrane, a process termed “capacitative calcium entry” (1Putney Jr., J.W. Cell Calcium. 1986; 7: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (2109) Google Scholar, 2Putney Jr., J.W. Capacitative Calcium Entry. Landes Biomedical Publishing, Austin, TX1997Crossref Google Scholar). The resulting increase in intracellular Ca2+ concentration regulates important processes, ranging from cell growth and differentiation to apoptosis and cell death. Molecular candidates for SOCs are the mammalian homologues of the Drosophila TRP (transient receptor potential) protein (3Birnbaumer L. Zhu X. Jiang M. Boulay G. Peyton M. Vannier B. Brown D. Platano D. Sadeghi H. Stefani E. Birnbaumer M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 15195-15202Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar). Expression of the related genes, however, has resulted in varying patterns of response, including constitutive activity, augmentation of capacitative calcium entry, apparent direct activation by IP3, and activation by diacylglycerol (4Putney Jr., J.W. McKay R.R. Bioessays. 1999; 21: 38-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar). Therefore, the mechanism by which emptying of intracellular Ca2+ stores activates SOCs remains elusive. Recent findings have favored a “direct coupling” model, whereby IP3 receptors in the store membranes sense the Ca2+-filling status of the stores and transfer this information via direct coupling to subunits of SOCs in the plasma membrane (5Irvine R.F.

Cell. 1999; 99: 5-8Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). For the present, the best knowledge of SOCs comes from electrophysiological studies of a specific current associated with SOCs, known as the Ca2+ release-activated calcium current (Icrac) (9Hoth M. Penner R. Nature. 1992; 355: 353-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (1491) Google Scholar). Despite extensive characterization of the macroscopic CRAC currents, the single-channel signature is poorly understood. This is because the channels are presumed to have a minute single-channel conductance, too low to be resolved at the single-channel level (10Zweifach A. Lewis R.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6295-6299Crossref PubMed Scopus (695) Google Scholar). During whole cell measurements in Jurkat T-lymphocytes, recently, Kerschbaum and Cahalan (11Kerschbaum H.H. Cahalan M.D. Science. 1999; 283: 836-839Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar) were able to detect for the first time single-channel events which they attributed to CRAC channels. Their approach was to measure currents in the complete absence of intra- and extracellular divalent cations. They reasoned that under these conditions CRAC channels, like voltage-gated Ca2+ channels should pass monovalent cations indiscriminately and with enhanced single-channel conductance (12Hoth M. Penner R. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1993; 465: 359-386Crossref Scopus (661) Google Scholar, 13Lepple-Wienhues A. Cahalan M.D. Biophys. J. 1996; 71: 787-794Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 14Kerschbaum H.H. Cahalan M.D. J. Gen. Physiol. 1998; 111: 521-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Indeed, in the absence of divalent cations large nonselective cation currents were observed, and during the initial stage of activation, single-channel conductances of 36 to 40 pS were measured in whole cell mode (11Kerschbaum H.H. Cahalan M.D. Science. 1999; 283: 836-839Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). However, the relationship of these large nonselective cation currents to the process of store depletion, and thus their identity as CRAC channels, has not been definitively established. Here we report similar single-channel activities measured for the first time in excised plasma membrane patches, using a mast cell line (RBL-2H3 m1) and divalent cation-free solutions. Our whole cell data are similar in some respects to those from Jurkat T-lymphocytes. In addition, because of direct access to the cytoplasmic surface of the channels, we have elucidated kinetic and regulatory properties of the channels. In particular, we have sought to determine whether or not these cation channels truly represent CRAC channels. In divalent cation-free solutions excised channels of 25 to 39 pS conductance showed stable activation, independent of IP3 or IP3 receptors, and were blocked by 2-APB, a relatively specific inhibitor of SOC activation (15Maruyama T. Kanaji T. Nakade S. Kanno T. Mikoshiba K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1997; 122: 498-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (774) Google Scholar, 16Ma H.-T. Patterson R.L. van Rossum D.B. Birnbaumer L. Mikoshiba K. Gill D.L. Science. 2000; 287: 1647-1651Crossref PubMed Scopus (533) Google Scholar). The effects of 2-APB, as well as the modulation of channel activity by Ca2+ provide evidence that the Na+-conducting channels are in fact single CRAC channels. Hence, this report offers new insight into the possible regulation mechanism of native SOCs and provides a novel approach to investigate these channels under low divalent conditions. Rat basophilic leukemia cells (RBL-2H3 m1), an immortalized mucosal mast cell line expressing m1 muscarinic receptors, were obtained from Dr. M. Beaven, National Institutes of Health (17Choi O.H. Lee J.H. Kassessinoff T. Cunha-Melo J.R. Jones S.V. Beaven M.A. J. Immunol. 1993; 151: 5586-5595PubMed Google Scholar). The cells were cultured in Earle's minimal essential medium with Earle's salts, 10% fetal bovine serum, 4 mm l-glutamine, 50 units/ml penicillin, and 50 mg/ml streptomycin (37 °C, 5% CO2). For experiments, cells were plated onto glass coverslips and used 12–36 h there after. Patch clamp experiments were performed at 20–22 °C in the tight-seal whole cell, cell-attached and inside-out configurations (18Hamill O.P. Marty A. Neher E. Sakmann B. Sigworth F.J. Pflügers Arch. 1981; 391: 85-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (15145) Google Scholar). Patch pipettes were pulled from borosilicate glass (Corning glass, 7052) and fire polished. Membrane currents, filtered at 1–2 kHz, were recorded using an Axopatch-200B amplifier (Axon Instruments, Burlingame, CA). Voltage clamp protocols were implemented and data acquisition performed with pCLAMP 7.0 Software (Axon Instruments). Solution changes were accomplished by bath perfusion. The time required for a complete change was around 2 s. All voltages were corrected for a liquid junction potential. For whole cell experiments with Ca2+ as charge carrier, unless stated otherwise, the patch pipette (2–5 megaohm) solutions had the following composition (in mm): 140 Cs+-aspartate, 2 MgCl2, 1 MgATP, 10 Cs+-BAPTA (with free calcium set to 100 nm, calculated using MaxChelator software, version 6.60), 10 HEPES (pH 7.2 with CsOH). The bath solutions contained (in mm) 140 NaCl, 4.7 KCl, 10 CsCl, 1,13 MgCl2, 10 glucose, 10 CaCl2, 10 HEPES (pH 7.2 with NaOH). Divalent free whole cell measurements, with Na+ as charge carrier, were done with pipettes containing (in mm) 128 Cs+-aspartate, 12 Cs+-BAPTA, 0.9 CaCl2 (free Ca2+ ∼5 nm), 10 HEPES (pH 7.2 with CsOH), and bath solutions containing (in mm) 150 Na+ methane sulfonate, 2 EDTA, 10 HEPES (pH 7.2 with NaOH). CRAC channels were opened by passive store-depletion with high BAPTA (12 mm) in the pipette solution, or by addition of ionomycin or thapsigargin to the bath. Cells were held at a potential of 0 mV. Every 1, 2, or 5 s either voltage ramps from −100 to +60 mV or voltage steps from 0 to −100 mV were delivered for 200 ms. Currents were sampled at 5 kHz during voltage ramps and 25 kHz during voltage steps. All whole cell data were corrected for leak currents. Leak current was collected in response to voltage ramps or steps immediately after establishing the whole cell configuration. During cell-attached and inside-out recordings data were collected from 10-s records at the given membrane potential, digitized at 5 or 10 kHz and filtered digitally for analysis and presentation. The pipette (5–10 megaohm) solutions contained (in mm) 150 NaCl, 2 EDTA, 10 HEPES (pH 7.2 with NaOH). In cell-attached experiments the bath solution contained (in mm) 145 KCl, 5 NaCl, 10 MgCl2, 10 HEPES (pH 7.2 with KOH) to nullify the cell's resting potential. 90 s before excision of the patch, the bath was perfused with intracellular solution, which contained (in mm) 145 K+-glutamate, 5 NaCl, 2 EDTA, 10 HEPES (pH 7.2 with KOH). Single-channel analysis was performed with the pCLAMP 6 software. po values were calculated for consecutive 1-s periods. Ca2+ release-activated Ca2+currents can be activated by a variety of procedures that share the common property of emptying intracellular IP3-sensitive stores. Stores can be depleted actively by exposure to receptor agonists that elevate IP3 levels, external application of Ca2+-ionophores like ionomycin, or the presence of IP3 in the patch pipette solution (19Parekh A.B. Penner R. Physiol. Rev. 1997; 77: 901-930Crossref PubMed Scopus (1291) Google Scholar). Passive methods for store depletion rely on a constitutive and ill-defined leak of Ca2+ from stores. If store refilling is prevented by inhibition of SERCA pumps or by high concentrations of cytoplasmic Ca2+ chelators, the stores gradually lose their Ca2+. In the whole cell measurements shown in Fig.1, we used the latter method and activated CRAC channels by breaking into the cell, while including high concentrations of the Ca2+-chelator, BAPTA (12 mm), in the pipette solution. With external Ca2+ present (Fig. 1 a), Ca2+ ions permeate through the open CRAC channels and the Ca2+-influx during progressive channel activation could be monitored as a developing small inward current, of 30 to 60 pA (2–3 pA/pF) (n = 5). Single-channel currents underlying the macroscopic Ca2+ currents were too small to be resolved, even at −120 mV membrane potential. With divalent free solutions and Na+ as the permeant ion, however, single-channel events have been observed during whole cell measurements in Jurkat T-lymphocytes (11Kerschbaum H.H. Cahalan M.D. Science. 1999; 283: 836-839Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). We first sought to determine whether similar currents could be observed with rat basophilic leukemia (RBL-2H3 m1) cells. The current development in Fig. 1 billustrates activation of a large inward current under divalent cation-free conditions (n = 6). The latency for current activation after break in, and the development time to reach the peak macroscopic current, were characteristically 1.5 to 2 times longer for the current in divalent-free solutions, than for Icrac in Ca2+-containing solutions. In the absence of divalent cations, dialysis of the cell with the pipette solution typically activated macroscopic currents up to 2000 pA (∼130 pA/pF), or ∼40-fold greater than Icrac. The current-voltage relationship of the fully developed current showed a modest inward rectification. External addition of 10 μm Mg2+ inhibited the monovalent currents in a voltage-dependent manner (data not shown). During the initial activation of the large cation current (see Fig.1 b), we were able to detect single-channel openings in RBL-2H3 m1 cells (Fig. 1 c). We recorded single-channel inward currents of 3.3 to 4 pA, during voltage steps to −100 mV, giving conductances of 33 to 40 pS (n = 6, assuming a reversible potential of 0 mV, see below). Based on the whole cell current amplitudes and the unitary current of the single-channels, we calculated the number of channels per cell to be 260 to 500 channels (n = 6). This suggests an average surface density of ∼0.22 channels per μm2. To gain access to the cytoplasmic surface of the channels, and to limit the number of investigated channels, we attempted to record the activity of individual channels in excised plasma membrane patches. Sodium ions (150 mm) were used as the primary charge carriers. Starting from cell-attached patches with no channel activity, we excised the patches into divalent cation-free solutions, while clamping the cell's membrane potential to −73 mV. In 65 out of 95 inside-out patches this procedure induced a channel activity, with an average conductance of 31 pS (25 pS to 39 pS) (Fig.2, a and b). We conclude that the channel activity seen after excision corresponds to the channels underlying the macroscopic current activated by divalent cation-free solutions; the single-channel conductance found in excised patches was similar to the conductance recorded in the whole cell mode (Fig. 1 c), the channels appear to have similar lack of selectivity, and the channels have similar, high open probability under total divalent cation-free conditions. When patches were excised into divalent-free media, the channels apparently needed no additional factors to be activated, such as IP3 or exogenously added IP3 receptors (7Zubov A.I. Kaznacheeva E.V.

Mozhayeva G.N. Pflügers Arch. 1999; 437: 305-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). However, if fragments of endoplasmic reticulum stores were still attached to the patches, the absence of ATP, Ca2+, and Mg2+ from the intracellular solutions could have induced store depletion, and thus caused or contributed to channel activation. Continuous channel activity began an average of 70 to 80 s after excision (Fig. 2 c) and was stable during recording time for at least 20 min, even after extensive washing. In 32% of the experiments the progressive opening of 6 and more channels in a patch could be observed, which may suggest clustering of CRAC channels in specific membrane domains. We examined the single-channel properties of channels in inside-out patches, in divalent cation-free solutions. Fig. 3 a shows recordings of 2 active channels in an excised inside-out patch, at different membrane potentials. The channels had a high open probability (0.94 ± 0.03 at −113 mV, n = 5). The duration of the closures from the open state decreased with hyperpolarization, from τ = 1.19 ± 0.13 (± S.E.) ms at −73 mV to τ = 0.50 ± 0.06 (± S.E.) ms at −113 mV (n = 7 cells). From traces such as those shown in Fig. 3 a, current amplitudes were measured manually or determined from all points amplitude histograms (Fig. 3 b), over a voltage range from −113 to +67 mV. The resulting current-voltage relationships (Fig.3 c) gave an average single-channel conductance of 31 pS (25 to 39 pS). Moreover, the IV-relationship was linear with a reversal potential close to 0 mV. As the major cation in the intracellular solution was K+, while that in the pipette was Na+, this is indicative of a channel that passes monovalent cations indiscriminately (12Hoth M. Penner R. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1993; 465: 359-386Crossref Scopus (661) Google Scholar). The IV-relationship is similar to that for the whole cell current, except the latter is slightly inwardly rectifying, due to a small effect of voltage on open probability (not shown). Another specific channel feature, the mean open time, was calculated to be 14.9 ± 1.2 (± S.E.) ms (n = 7) (Fig. 3 d). The results in Fig. 1 show that the activation of the large cation current by divalent cation-free solutions was considerably slower than the activation of Icrac, despite the expectation that passive store emptying by BAPTA should occur at a similar rate in the two conditions. This would indicate that the activation of cation channels by divalent cation-free solutions involves a mechanism other than, or in addition to store depletion. Alternatively, it is possible that the absence of divalent cations slows the mechanism for coupling store depletion to channel activation. To address these possibilities, we carried out experiments in which Ca2+-stores were emptied and CRAC channels thus activated prior to going whole cell or excision into divalent cation-free media. Before sealing on the cells, we applied either 1 μm of the SERCA inhibitor, thapsigargin plus 500 nm of the ionophore ionomycin, or 500 nm ionomycin alone. The incubation time with these drugs was minimally 5 min, by which time stores should be completely depleted and the currents should have fully developed (21Huang Y. Putney Jr., J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19554-19559Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Subsequently, we patched the cells, and established either the whole cell configuration with either Ca2+ or Na+ as charge carriers, or excised the patch (inside-out mode) at −73 mV V m into divalent-free solutions. In the whole cell experiments, the pipette solutions included high concentrations of BAPTA to passively deplete stores in the control cells. Prior depletion of Ca2+-stores resulted in preactivation of Icrac with about 2 pA/pF (7/7) when measured with Ca2+ as the charge carrier (Fig.4, a and b, inset). However, directly after switching to Na+ in divalent free solutions, the current only increased 4-fold (Fig. 4 b, inset), corresponding to about 10% of activation compared with the peak macroscopic divalent free currents (Fig. 4 b). This 4-fold activation may correspond to the current seen in Jurkat cells by Kerschbaum and Cahalan (11Kerschbaum H.H. Cahalan M.D. Science. 1999; 283: 836-839Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar) in the absence of external divalent cations, but with Mg2+ present in the cytoplasm. However, in the RBL-2H3 cells no larger, transient inward current was observed. Similar kinetics for RBL-1 cells have been reported by Fiero et al. (22Fierro L. Lund P.-E. Parekh A.B. Pflügers Arch. 2000; 440: 580-587PubMed Google Scholar). Following this 4-fold jump, which was only seen in the preactivated cells, a slower activation to the full, maximally conducting state was observed, and the kinetics of this process were similar in control and preactivated cells. Likewise, the appearance of single-channel openings following excision into divalent cation-free solutions occurred with a similar delay when stores were previously emptied (Fig. 4 c). Taken together, these results demonstrate that the delay time for whole cell current activation by divalent cation-free solutions, as well as the delay time for channel activation following excision into divalent cation-free solutions does not appear to depend on depletion of Ca2+-stores. However, they do not rule out a requirement for initial store depletion, followed by a subsequent amplification step, which is rate-limiting. Nonetheless, the mechanism by which observable single-channel activation occurs appears to be at least somewhat distinct from the mechanism of activation of Icrac by store depletion. Note, however, that activation of an intermediate activity state of the channels, similar to that seen with low divalent cations outside and with Mg2+ inside (11Kerschbaum H.H. Cahalan M.D. Science. 1999; 283: 836-839Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 22Fierro L. Lund P.-E. Parekh A.B. Pflügers Arch. 2000; 440: 580-587PubMed Google Scholar), did appear to be hastened by prior depletion of Ca2+-stores. The significance of this observation will be considered subsequently under “Discussion.” To further address the issue of whether the channels activated by divalent cation-free solutions represent CRAC channels, we next examined the modulation of these channels by internal divalent cations and by pH to compare their behavior which was shown previously for CRAC channels. Krause et al. (23Krause E. Schmid A. Gonzalez A. Schulz I. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36957-36962Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) reported from whole cell studies in RBL-1 cells, that Icrac activation changed from spontaneous to storeoperated mode, if the cytosolic [Ca2+] is elevated to more than 50 nm. The spontaneous Icrac was inactivated at a resting cytosolic [Ca2+] of 105 nm. On the basis of their finding, after reaching full channel activity in the inside-out mode, we perfused the bath with intracellular solution containing 100 nm free Ca2+ (Fig.5 a). This concentration completely inhibited channel activity in 50.5 ± 9.5 s in 4 patches, while in 3 other patches channel activity was unaffected. In the 4 patches in which channel activity was inhibited, restoration of low Ca2+ conditions reversed the inhibition in only 1 of the 4 experiments. The inhibitory effect of Ca2+ was rather specific and not due to inhibition of monovalent currents by divalent ions per se, because similarly low concentrations of free Mg2+ failed to inhibit. However, if 100 μmMg2+ or more was added to the inner surface of the active channels, inhibition developed in 13.4 ± 3.1 s (12 out of 12 patches) (Fig. 5 b). The activity was restored by divalent free buffers (not shown). In both cases, as the inhibition developed, single channel conductance was unaffected indicating that the divalent cations suppress open probability. In the whole cell mode in Jurkat T-lymphocytes, the inactivation of Na+ current by intracellular Mg2+ could be reduced by increasing the intracellular pH (14Kerschbaum H.H. Cahalan M.D. J. Gen. Physiol. 1998; 111: 521-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The experiment in Fig.5 c demonstrates a similar effect of increasing pH for the channels in excised patches. After inhibition by 100 μmMg2+ (pH 7.2), channel activity could be rescued by increasing the pH in the perfusion solution to pH 8.2 (4 out of 7 cells). The time needed for complete reversal in the cells that responded to the pH change was 42 ± 10 s. We also carried out experiments similar to those described by Kerschbaum and Cahalan (14Kerschbaum H.H. Cahalan M.D. J. Gen. Physiol. 1998; 111: 521-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) in which the channels were inhibited by addition of a much higher concentration of Mg2+ (2.4 mm). Channel activity was blocked in 7 of 7 experiments, but in three attempts there was no recovery on shifting to pH 8.0 (not shown). From the experiments depicted in Fig. 5, some interesting observations can be made. First, the results provide evidence that the single-channels are the channels underlying the large whole cell current in divalent cation-free solutions. Second, the inhibition of the channels with Ca2+ and Mg2+ concentrations in the physiological range explains the inability to detect the same channels in the cell-attached mode. In the cell-attached mode, neither addition of 1 μm thapsigargin (n = 14) nor addition of 500 nm ionomycin (n = 13) evoked detectable single-channel activity. Note that under these conditions, whole cell currents (Icrac, pA magnitude) can be seen indicating that single channels must be opening; but these channels are not detectable because in the presence of Ca2+ or Mg2+ the single channel conductance and/or frequency of opening is below the level of detection. Third, the ability of low, physiological concentrations of Ca2+ to inhibit the channels is consistent with their identity as CRAC channels. Recent reports have supported a conformational coupling model for SOC activation, whereby IP3 receptors in the endoplasmic reticulum sense the Ca2+ filling status of the stores and transfer this information via direct coupling to SOCs in the plasma membrane (5Irvine R.F.

Science. 2000; 287: 1647-1651Crossref PubMed Scopus (533) Google Scholar) concluded from their studies, using the membrane permeant IP3 receptor inhibitor 2-APB that IP3 receptors are essential not only for opening of SOCs, but also for maintaining their activation. On this basis, we examined the effects of 2-APB on macroscopic currents, and on channel activity in excised patches. The results shown before in Fig. 2 demonstrate that no added IP3 or added IP3 receptors are necessary to maintain activity of CRAC channels in excised patches under divalent cation-free conditions. This is in contrast to previous reports demonstrating that Trp-3 channel activity (24Kiselyov K. Xu X. Mozhayeva G. Kuo T. Pessah I. Mignery G. Zhu X. Birnbaumer L. Muallem S. Nature. 1998; 396: 478-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (561) Google Scholar) and store-operated channel activity in A431 cells (7Zubov A.I. Kaznacheeva E.V. Alexeeno V.A. Kiselyov K. Muallem S. Mozhayeva G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25983-25985Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) were rapidly lost in the absence of added IP3 and IP3 receptors. This may indicate that once activated under divalent-free conditions, CRAC channel activity is independent of Ca2+-store depletion and coupling to IP3 receptors (although we cannot unequivocally rule out the stable retention of fragments of endoplasmic reticulum and IP3 receptors). Thus, we were initially not surprised to find that addition of 100 μm 2-APB to the medium surrounding activated channels in excised patches in most instances failed to inhibit channel activity (for example, Fig.6 d). However, with this protocol 2-APB is added to the cytoplasmic side of the plasma membrane, while in previous studies of Ma et al. (16Ma H.-T. Patterson R.L. van Rossum D.B. Birnbaumer L. Mikoshiba K. Gill D.L. Science. 2000; 287: 1647-1651Crossref PubMed Scopus (533) Google Scholar), the drug was always added to the outside. Experiments illustrated in Fig. 6,a and b, show that in the whole cell configuration, with either Ca2+ or Na+ as charge carrier, 2-APB blocked the current completely when applied externally, but had significantly less effect when applied in the pipette. Finally, although 2-APB blocked channel activity when applied to the cytoplasmic side of excised patches in only 2 of 11 experiments (Fig. 6 d), if included in the patch pipette, channel activation did not occur in any of 10 separate experiments (Fig.6 c). These results suggest that 2-APB may be acting as a direct blocker of SOCs, rather than as an IP3 receptor antagonist as supposed in earlier studies. However, because of the protocols used, we considered the possibility that once the channels were activated by divalent cation-free solutions, they would lose their sensitivity to the effects of"

A prominent feature of CD19 signaling is the binding and activation of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (P13K), which accounts for the majority of PI3K activity induced by BCR ligation. Recent findings have implicated activation of the serine/threonine kinase Akt as imparting survival signals in a PI3K-dependent fashion. Using CD19-deficient B-lymphoma cells and mouse splenic B-cells, we show that CD19 is necessary for efficient activation of Akt following cross-linking of surface immunoglobulin or Igβ. In the absence of CD19, Akt kinase activity is reduced and transient. In addition, coligation of CD19 with surface immunoglobulin leads to augmented Akt activity in a dose-dependent manner. Thus, CD19 is a key regulator of Akt activity in B-cells; as such it may contribute to pre-BCR or BCR-mediated cell survival in vivo.

https://openalex.org/W2083833577,"G-protein-coupled receptor kinases (GRKs) are important regulators of G-protein-coupled receptor function. Two members of this family L, GRK2 and GRK5 L, have been shown to be substrates for protein kinase C (PKC). Whereas PKC-mediated phosphorylation results in inhibition of GRK5, it increases the activity of GRK2 toward its substrates probably through increased affinity for receptor-containing membranes. We show here that this increase in activity may be caused by relieving a tonic inhibition of GRK2 by calmodulin. In vitro, GRK2 was preferentially phosphorylated by PKC isoforms α, γ, and δ. Two-dimensional peptide mapping of PKCα-phosphorylated GRK2 showed a single site of phosphorylation, which was identified as serine 29 by HPLC-MS. A S29A mutant of GRK2 was not phosphorylated by PKC in vitro and showed no phorbol ester-stimulated phosphorylation when transfected into human embryonic kidney (HEK)293 cells. Serine 29 is located in the calmodulin-binding region of GRK2, and binding of calmodulin to GRK2 results in inhibition of kinase activity. This inhibition was almost completely abolished in vitro when GRK2 was phosphorylated by PKC. These data suggest that calmodulin may be an inhibitor of GRK2 whose effects can be abolished with PKC-mediated phosphorylation of GRK2. G-protein-coupled receptor kinases (GRKs) are important regulators of G-protein-coupled receptor function. Two members of this family L, GRK2 and GRK5 L, have been shown to be substrates for protein kinase C (PKC). Whereas PKC-mediated phosphorylation results in inhibition of GRK5, it increases the activity of GRK2 toward its substrates probably through increased affinity for receptor-containing membranes. We show here that this increase in activity may be caused by relieving a tonic inhibition of GRK2 by calmodulin. In vitro, GRK2 was preferentially phosphorylated by PKC isoforms α, γ, and δ. Two-dimensional peptide mapping of PKCα-phosphorylated GRK2 showed a single site of phosphorylation, which was identified as serine 29 by HPLC-MS. A S29A mutant of GRK2 was not phosphorylated by PKC in vitro and showed no phorbol ester-stimulated phosphorylation when transfected into human embryonic kidney (HEK)293 cells. Serine 29 is located in the calmodulin-binding region of GRK2, and binding of calmodulin to GRK2 results in inhibition of kinase activity. This inhibition was almost completely abolished in vitro when GRK2 was phosphorylated by PKC. These data suggest that calmodulin may be an inhibitor of GRK2 whose effects can be abolished with PKC-mediated phosphorylation of GRK2. G-protein-coupled receptor G-protein-coupled receptor kinase protein kinase C high performance liquid chromatography mass spectrometry phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate glutathione S-transferase human embryonic kidney cell Signaling via G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs)1 is subject to a variety of regulatory processes. One of the key regulatory mechanisms is the control of receptor function by G-protein-coupled receptor kinases (GRKs). These kinases phosphorylate the agonist-bound state of GPCRs, and this phosphorylation is often the initial step in homologous receptor desensitization, the loss of receptor responsiveness upon repeated or prolonged receptor stimulation (1Lohse M.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1179: 171-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar, 2Krupnick J.G. Benovic J.L. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1998; 38: 289-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (857) Google Scholar). To date, six members of the GRK family are known (3Lohse M.J. Krasel C. Winstel R. Mayor Jr., F. Kidney Int. 1996; 49: 1047-1052Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 4Pitcher J.A. Freedman N.J. Lefkowitz R.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 653-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (1061) Google Scholar). Of these, GRK2 (previously called β-adrenergic receptor kinase-1) as well as GRK3, GRK5, and GRK6 are widely expressed throughout the mammalian body whereas GRK1 (also known as rhodopsin kinase) and GRK4 have been found only in specific tissues. All GRKs have a similar molecular architecture. A central catalytic domain is flanked by an N- and C-terminal domain. The function of the latter is to provide a membrane anchor, which seems to be essential for receptor phosphorylation (5Pitcher J.A. Inglese J. Higgins J.B. Arriza J.L. Casey P.J. Kim C. Benovic J.L. Kwatra M.M. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Science. 1992; 257: 1264-1267Crossref PubMed Scopus (567) Google Scholar). The C terminus of GRK1 is farnesylated, whereas GRK2 and GRK3 possess a pleckstrin homology domain implicated in phosphatidylinositol bisphosphate and G-protein βγ-subunit binding. GRK4 and GRK6 are palmitoylated, and GRK5 binds phospholipids through a poorly defined polybasic domain (3Lohse M.J. Krasel C. Winstel R. Mayor Jr., F. Kidney Int. 1996; 49: 1047-1052Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 4Pitcher J.A. Freedman N.J. Lefkowitz R.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 653-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (1061) Google Scholar). The function of the N terminus is less clear. It has been shown for GRK1 that antibodies against an epitope in the N terminus prevent phosphorylation of light-activated rhodopsin but not of a peptide substrate (6Palczewski K. Buczylko J. Lebioda L. Crabb J.W. Polans A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 6004-6013Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, the epitope against which the antibodies were directed is poorly conserved in the GRK family. Recent results have indicated that the N terminus of GRK2 and GRK3 contains an RGS (regulator of G-protein signaling) domain that specifically binds to and activates Gαq (7Carman C.V. Parent J.-L. Day P.W. Pronin A.N. Sternweis P.M. Wedegaertner P.B. Gilman A.G. Benovic J.L. Kozasa T. J. Biol.

Pharmacol. 2000; 57: 826-831Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). In addition, the extreme N terminus of GRK2 and GRK5 contains a binding site for Ca2+/calmodulin. Binding of Ca2+/calmodulin to this site causes an inhibition of GRK activity, and this may represent a mechanism for the regulation of GRKs (9Chuang T.T. Paolucci L. De Blasi A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28691-28696Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 10Pronin A.N. Satpaev D.K. Slepak V.Z. Benovic J.L. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 13650-13659Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). In addition to GRKs, other kinases have been found to phosphorylate GPCRs. The most prominent kinases capable of phosphorylating receptors are the protein kinases A and C (PKC), which are activated by the second messengers generated after stimulation of these receptors. Recent studies have identified cross-talk between PKC and GRKs, which may provide another level of regulation of GRKs. PKC has been shown to phosphorylate GRK2 (12Chuang T.T. LeVine III H. De Blasi A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18660-18665Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 13Winstel R. Freund S. Krasel C. Hoppe E. Lohse M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 2105-2109Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar) and GRK5 (14Pronin A.N. Benovic J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3806-3812Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Whereas phosphorylation of GRK5 by PKC attenuated its activity (14Pronin A.N. Benovic J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3806-3812Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 15Winstel R. Dicker F. Lohse M.J. Naunyn-Schmiedeberg's Arch. Pharmacol. 1997; 355: R50Google Scholar), PKC-phosphorylated GRK2 caused significantly enhanced receptor phosphorylation and desensitization (12Chuang T.T. LeVine III H. De Blasi A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18660-18665Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 13Winstel R. Freund S. Krasel C. Hoppe E. Lohse M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 2105-2109Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). This enhancement was at least partially caused by a PKC-mediated stimulation of GRK2 translocation from the cytosol to the plasma membrane where the substrate receptors are located (13Winstel R. Freund S. Krasel C. Hoppe E. Lohse M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 2105-2109Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). The molecular mechanisms of this activation have, however, not been resolved. Hence, we have investigated the exact nature of the phosphorylation and regulation of GRK2 by PKC. We report here that phosphorylation of GRK2 by PKC occurs in the N terminus and that this phosphorylation abolishes the inhibitory effect of Ca2+/calmodulin on GRK2 activity. Crude phosphatidylcholine (type II-S from soybean) and calmodulin (from bovine testes, activity at least 40,000 units/mg protein) were from Sigma. The GRK2 antiserum has been described previously (13Winstel R. Freund S. Krasel C. Hoppe E. Lohse M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 2105-2109Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and antibiotics in a humidified incubator with 7% CO2. HEK293 cells were transfected with a modified calcium phosphate method (16Chen C. Okayama H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2745-2752Crossref PubMed Scopus (4815) Google Scholar). COS cells were transfected using DEAE-dextran (17Cullen B.R. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 152: 687-704Google Scholar). Transiently transfected cells were analyzed ∼48 h after transfection. The construction of the cDNA coding for GST fused to human GRK2-(552–689) has already been described (13Winstel R. Freund S. Krasel C. Hoppe E. Lohse M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 2105-2109Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). cDNAs coding for the N terminus (amino acids 1–185) or the pleckstrin homology domain (amino acids 552–656) of human GRK2 were amplified from the full-length cDNA by PCR with Pfu polymerase (Stratagene) and cloned into the vector pGEX1λT (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for expression as GST fusion proteins (18Krasel C. Winstel R. Lohse M.J. Naunyn-Schmiedeberg's Arch. Pharmacol. 1999; 359: R19Google Scholar). Point mutations on human GRK2 were introduced by the method of Kunkel (19Kunkel T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 488-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (4894) Google Scholar). All constructs were verified by automated sequencing. G-protein βγ-subunits were purified from bovine brain according to Sternweis and Robishaw (20Sternweis P.C. Robishaw J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 13806-13813Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). GST fusion proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 and purified by affinity chromatography as described previously (13Winstel R. Freund S. Krasel C. Hoppe E. Lohse M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 2105-2109Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Human and bovine GRK2 were expressed in baculovirus-infected Sf9 cells and purified according to Kim et al. (21Kim C.M. Dion S.B. Onorato J.J. Benovic J.L. Receptor. 1993; 3: 39-55PubMed Google Scholar). PKC isozymes were purified from baculovirus-infected Sf9 cells as described previously (22Kazanietz M.G. Areces L.B. Bahador A. Mischak H. Goodnight J. Mushiniski J.F. Blumberg P.M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1993; 44: 298-307PubMed Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were determined according to Bradford (23Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (214351) Google Scholar). PKC activity was determined using a soluble peptide substrate, [Ser25]PKCα-(19–31) as described previously (22Kazanietz M.G. Areces L.B. Bahador A. Mischak H. Goodnight J. Mushiniski J.F. Blumberg P.M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1993; 44: 298-307PubMed Google Scholar). GRK2 activity was usually measured by using urea-treated rod outer segments (50 pmol of rhodopsin) as the substrate in the presence of 50 nm purified G-protein βγ-subunits as described previously (24Söhlemann P. Hekman M. Elce J.S Buchen C. Lohse M.J. FEBS Lett. 1993; 324: 59-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Incubation was carried out at 30 °C for 8 min.32P incorporation into rhodopsin was determined by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of the reaction mixture, excision of the rhodopsin band, and Cerenkov counting or quantification with a phosphorimager. To assess phosphorylation of soluble substrates by GRKs, 16 pmol of a GST fusion protein of the C terminus of the parathyroid hormone receptor were incubated with GRK2 for 30 min at 30 °C. For investigation of the effects of calmodulin and/or PKC on GRK2 activity, GRK2 was preincubated with 70 units of calmodulin and/or 25 pmol of PKC for 30 min at 30 °C in the dark before adding rod outer segments. PKC was activated with 10 μm PMA. Approximately 3 pmol of purified PKC were incubated with the indicated amounts of recombinant proteins (GRK2 or GRK2 fragments) in the presence of 4 μg of crude phosphatidylcholine vesicles in 20 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.2, 2 mm EDTA, 8 mm MgCl2, 50 μmCaCl2, 1 μm PMA, 100 μm[γ-32P]ATP (∼500 cpm/pmol) for 45 min at 30 °C. Proteins were resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and visualized by autoradiography. 200 ng of purified GRK2 were phosphorylated with 10 ng of recombinant PKCα in the presence of 20 μm [γ-32P]ATP (1 Ci/mmol). The mix was separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and the phosphorylated band was identified using autoradiography. It was then excised from the gel and digested with endopeptidase LysC, and the peptide mixture was separated by reverse-phase HPLC coupled to a radiodetector and an API 100 quadrupole mass spectrometer as described previously (25Janosch P. Schellerer M. Seitz T. Reim P. Eulitz M. Brielmayr M. Kolch W. Sedivy J.M. Mischak H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13868-13874Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). GRK2 was phosphorylated and digested as above. Labeled peptides were analyzed by two-dimensional phosphopeptide mapping as described (26Mischak H. Seitz T. Janosch P. Eulitz M. Steen H. Schellerer M. Philipp A. Kolch W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5409-5418Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). The experiment was also performed with a synthetic peptide comprising residues 7–34 of GRK2 with identical results. It has been previously shown that crude preparations of PKC purified from rat or bovine brain are capable of phosphorylating GRK2 and GRK5 (12Chuang T.T. LeVine III H. De Blasi A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18660-18665Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 13Winstel R. Freund S. Krasel C. Hoppe E. Lohse M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 2105-2109Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 14Pronin A.N. Benovic J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3806-3812Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). To examine which of the PKC isoforms were responsible for phosphorylation of GRKs, we analyzed PKC preparations from baculovirus-infected Sf9 cells for their ability to phosphorylate GRK2 and GRK5. The activity of these fractions was calibrated with histone H1 as a substrate. Equal amounts of the various PKC isoforms were then used to phosphorylate purified GRK2 and GRK5 (Fig.1). Whereas GRK5 was quite a good substrate for all PKC isoforms tested except for PKCε, GRK2 was only significantly phosphorylated by PKCs α, γ, and δ. The radioactivity incorporated into GRKs in the absence of PKC (Fig. 1,A and B, right lanes) is caused by autophosphorylation. Because GRK2 is selectively phosphorylated by only certain PKC isoforms, whereas, with the exception of PKCε, GRK5 serves as substrate for all PKCs, these data suggest that the two types of phosphorylation might be different. Because of their higher activity toward GRK2, all subsequent experiments were done with recombinant PKCα or PKCδ. We had shown previously that GRK2 could be phosphorylated by rat brain PKC preparations to a stoichiometry of about one, suggesting a single phosphorylation site on GRK2. To verify the existence of a single phosphorylation site, we performed two-dimensional phosphopeptide mapping of GRK2. GRK2 was phosphorylated in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP with PKCα, digested with endopeptidase LysC, and the peptides resolved by two-dimensional electrophoresis. Only a single radiolabeled spot derived from GRK2 was identified, indicating the presence of a single phosphorylation site (Fig.2). To map this phosphorylation site, we performed HPLC-MS analysis of the LysC-digested peptides. The peptide containing the transferred phosphate was detected online with a radiodetector, and its mass was directly analyzed by electrospray-MS (Fig.3). The major peak of radioactivity was identified as (AT)PAARASK based on the mass of the peptide and the fragmentation spectrum. This region corresponds to residues 22–30 of human GRK2 and identifies Ser29 as the single phosphorylation site for PKC in GRK2. To confirm this finding, a synthetic peptide comprising residues 7–34 of human GRK2 was synthesized, phosphorylated with PKCα, digested with endopeptidase LysC, and subjected to two-dimensional peptide mapping as described above. The resulting phosphopeptide pattern was identical to the one obtained with full-length GRK2, as shown in separate or overlay analyses (Fig. 4). These data corroborate the correct identification of the phosphorylation site. To verify that Ser29 is indeed the site phosphorylated by PKC, we constructed a mutant of human GRK2 in which this residue was replaced with alanine (S29A). This mutant was expressed in Sf9 cells using the baculovirus system and purified in a way identical to the wild-type protein. Purified S29A GRK2 was able to phosphorylate rhodopsin in a manner similar to the wild-type protein although its specific activity was lower (data not shown). As expected, PKCδ was unable to phosphorylate the S29A GRK2, in contrast to wild-type GRK2 (Fig. 5). These data confirm that Ser29 is indeed the only phosphorylation site for PKC in GRK2. We and others have shown previously that phosphorylation of GRK2 with PKC purified from bovine or rat brain leads to increased GRK2 activity on rhodopsin (12Chuang T.T. LeVine III H. De Blasi A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18660-18665Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 13Winstel R. Freund S. Krasel C. Hoppe E. Lohse M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 2105-2109Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, when we tried to reproduce these findings with PKCα or PKCδ purified from Sf9 cells, we obtained no stimulation. Instead, we observed a slight nonsignificant reduction of GRK2 activity after PKC phosphorylation (Fig. 6,left). This discrepancy between our data suggests that the brain PKC preparations might have contained additional proteins that influence the activity of GRK2. One such protein might be calmodulin. Calmodulin has been shown to attenuate GRK2 activity, and the calmodulin binding site encompasses Ser29 of GRK2 (11Levay K. Satpaev D.K. Pronin A.N. Benovic J.L. Slepak V.Z. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 13650-13659Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). To investigate whether calmodulin could in fact be the postulated “missing protein,” we examined the influence of calmodulin on GRK2 activity. Calmodulin inhibited the activity of bovine GRK2 by more than 75% as measured by the GRK2-mediated phosphorylation of light-activated rhodopsin (Fig. 6, right). This inhibition was completely reversed when active PKC was present in the assay (Fig. 6,right). These data show that PKC activates GRK2 by relieving the Ca2+/calmodulin-mediated inhibition. Finally we wanted to verify that Ser29 represents the functionally relevant PKC phosphorylation site in intact cells. To achieve this, HEK293 cells were transiently transfected with wild-type or S29A mutant GRK2. When the cells were stimulated with PMA, cells transfected with wild-type GRK2 showed a roughly 2-fold increase in cytoplasmic GRK activity (Fig.7, left). In the case of the S29A mutant, this stimulation of GRK activity by PMA was almost completely abolished (Fig. 7, right). The residual effects of PMA seen under these conditions are probably caused by endogenous wild-type GRK2. These results indicate that PKC-mediated phosphorylation of GRK2 at Ser29 does indeed cause its activation in intact cells by relieving a constitutive inhibition through calmodulin or a related protein. The function and activity of G-protein-coupled receptors is controlled by several classes of proteins via a multitude of mechanisms. A general feature of these mechanisms is that they are interrelated and that they appear to be controlled at several different levels. A particularly intriguing example of this complex control is the inhibition of receptor activity by GRKs, which is itself subject to control by PKC. Whereas GRK5 activity toward receptors was decreased following phosphorylation by PKC (14Pronin A.N. Benovic J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3806-3812Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar), GRK2 activity toward small soluble receptor substrates was also decreased by PKC, but its activityversus membrane-bound receptors was increased (12Chuang T.T. LeVine III H. De Blasi A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18660-18665Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 13Winstel R. Freund S. Krasel C. Hoppe E. Lohse M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 2105-2109Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). These data suggested that PKC might activate GRK2 by increasing its association with membrane-bound receptors (13Winstel R. Freund S. Krasel C. Hoppe E. Lohse M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 2105-2109Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). PKC phosphorylation studies utilizing a protein comprised of the C terminus of GRK2 fused to GST had initially suggested the presence of a C-terminal phosphorylation site in GRK2 (13Winstel R. Freund S. Krasel C. Hoppe E. Lohse M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 2105-2109Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). In the present study, using intact GRK2 and purified recombinant PKC isozymes, we have mapped the PKC phosphorylation site in GRK2 unequivocally to serine 29 in the N terminus, and we can exclude phosphorylation of the GRK2 C terminus by PKC. We have further shown that PKC phosphorylation of GRK2 does not directly stimulate the activity of the isolated GRK2 in vitro. On the other hand, our previous experiments clearly indicated that phosphorylation of GRK2 with PKC preparations obtained from bovine brain caused an ∼2.5-fold increase in the incorporation of phosphate into rhodopsin (13Winstel R. Freund S. Krasel C. Hoppe E. Lohse M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 2105-2109Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Similarly, Chuang et al. (12Chuang T.T. LeVine III H. De Blasi A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18660-18665Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar) also observed activation of GRK2 after phosphorylation with a PKC preparation purified from bovine brain. As shown here, we were unable to reproduce these results using PKC isozymes purified from baculovirus-infected Sf9 cells. These discrepancies raised the possibility that the GRK2 activation observed after phosphorylation with PKC might be the result of additional protein(s) present in the brain PKC preparations, but not in the PKCs purified from Sf9 cells. One candidate for such a protein was calmodulin, which has previously been shown to inhibit GRK2 activity (10Pronin A.N. Satpaev D.K. Slepak V.Z. Benovic J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18273-18280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 11Levay K. Satpaev D.K. Pronin A.N. Benovic J.L. Slepak V.Z. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 13650-13659Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Indeed, purified recombinant GRK2 was inhibited by calmodulin, and this inhibition could be fully reversed when GRK2 was phosphorylated by PKC. We and others have previously reported that PKC activation of GRK2 also occurs in intact cells (12Chuang T.T. LeVine III H. De Blasi A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18660-18665Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 13Winstel R. Freund S. Krasel C. Hoppe E. Lohse M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 2105-2109Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Here, we show that removal of the PKC phosphorylation site on GRK2 also abolishes GRK2 activation through PKC. This indicates that a pool of GRK2 in the cell may be tonically inhibited by forming a complex with calmodulin or a related protein from which it is released through PKC phosphorylation. Whereas our experiments offer a mechanistic explanation for the phenomenon of GRK2 activation by PKC, they also raise several questions. First, how does calmodulin inhibit GRK2, and how is this inhibition altered following phosphorylation of GRK2 by PKC? It is conceivable that calmodulin competes with the agonist-activated receptor for GRK2. This suggestion is supported by findings obtained with GRK1 (rhodopsin kinase) and rhodopsin. An antiserum directed against amino acids 17–34 of GRK1 was able to inhibit phosphorylation of light-activated rhodopsin but not of a peptide substrate (6Palczewski K. Buczylko J. Lebioda L. Crabb J.W. Polans A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 6004-6013Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, this region of GRK1 is also able to bind rhodopsin, as is the corresponding region of GRK5 (11Levay K. Satpaev D.K. Pronin A.N. Benovic J.L. Slepak V.Z. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 13650-13659Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Furthermore, N-terminal truncation of GRKs 2 and 5 impairs their ability to phosphorylate rhodopsin (27Yu Q.-M. Cheng Z.-J. Gan X.-Q. Bao G.-B. Li L. Pei G. J. Neurochem. 1999; 73: 1222-1227Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). These data indicate that the N terminus of GRKs might be involved in binding to the receptor substrates. The sequence homology of the calmodulin-binding sites in GRK2 and GRK5 is, however, quite low. The proximal C terminus of GRK2 (residues 457–546 of 689) has been implicated in receptor binding as well (28Gan X.-Q. Wang J.-Y. Yang Q.-H. Li Z. Liu F. Pei G. Li L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8469-8474Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). This suggests that both C- and N-terminal regions of GRK are involved in receptor association. The C terminus has been shown to interact with light-activated rhodopsin by itself, suggesting that it may be sensitive to the conformational changes occurring in G-protein-coupled receptors upon activation (28Gan X.-Q. Wang J.-Y. Yang Q.-H. Li Z. Liu F. Pei G. Li L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8469-8474Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). In contrast, truncation of the N terminus does not abolish the ability of GRKs to be activated by agonist-occupied receptors (27Yu Q.-M. Cheng Z.-J. Gan X.-Q. Bao G.-B. Li L. Pei G. J. Neurochem. 1999; 73: 1222-1227Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). It therefore appears that the N terminus is not involved in sensing the activated state of the receptor but may contribute some weak interaction that is required for efficient substrate recognition. Evidently, additional experiments are necessary to prove this hypothesis. Another question is how phosphorylation of GRK2 by PKC affects its regulation by Ca2+/calmodulin. Such inhibition might be because of a reduction in direct binding affinity (measured to be around 40 nm, see Ref. 11Levay K. Satpaev D.K. Pronin A.N. Benovic J.L. Slepak V.Z. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 13650-13659Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), but it might also be more complex and involve other regions of the GRKs. (A second calmodulin binding domain has been mapped to residues 466–689 of GRK2, Ref. 11Levay K. Satpaev D.K. Pronin A.N. Benovic J.L. Slepak V.Z. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 13650-13659Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar.) Such a more complex interaction is suggested by the fact that phosphorylation of GRK2 by PKC (as well as of GRK5) has a direct inhibitory effect on the activity of the catalytic core region of GRKs if, instead of a membrane-bound receptor, a soluble substrate was phosphorylated. This was either a peptide (13Winstel R. Freund S. Krasel C. Hoppe E. Lohse M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 2105-2109Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 14Pronin A.N. Benovic J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3806-3812Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) or the soluble C terminus of the parathyroid hormone receptor (data not shown). It is remarkable that GRK2 seems to possess a special versatility for regulating the activity of Gq-coupled receptors. It is inhibited by Ca2+/calmodulin and thereby regulated by Gq-mediated alterations in intracellular free Ca2+-levels. This inhibition is released through PKC activity, which can also be controlled via Gq. In addition, GRK2 contains an RGS domain, which leads to fairly selective inhibition of Gq-mediated signal transduction pathways (7Carman C.V. Parent J.-L. Day P.W. Pronin A.N. Sternweis P.M.

Iacovelli L. De Blasi A. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 57: 826-831Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). The reasons for this specialization of GRK2 are at the moment completely unclear, in particular because GRK2 was initially thought to be particularly active toward the Gs-coupled β-adrenergic receptors. Taken together, our data delineate a previously unknown mechanism of regulation of G-protein-coupled receptors, which is exerted by an interplay of PKC and Ca2+/calmodulin in regulating the activity of GRK2. These observations are a further step in the complex machinery regulating the function of these receptors. We thank Frank Dicker for the plasmid encoding the GST fusion protein of the parathyroid hormone receptor C terminus and Christian Dees for purification of GRK2."

It is known that mammalian eIF3, like eIF4A, interacts with the central domain of mammalian eIF4G, but eIF3 appears to have a separate binding site from eIF4A (32Lamphear B.J. Kirchweger R. Skern T.

The interaction of mammalian eIF3 with eIF4G could play a role in positioning the mRNA and associated initiation factors on the 40 S ribosome at the initiation codon (35Preiss T. Hentze M.W. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1999; 9: 515-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Mammalian eIF4B, another mRNA-associated initiation factor, was shown also to interact with mammalian eIF3 (36Methot N. Song M.S. Sonenberg N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5328-5334Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Interestingly, a similar interaction of S. cerevisiae eIF4B and S. cerevisiae eIF3 could not be demonstrated, suggesting that there may be some fundamental differences in the way eIF3 functions in different organisms (25Vornlocher H.P.

The expression patterns of some of the subunits of wheat eIF3 indicated differential regulation and expression during seed development and germination and following heat shock (38Gallie D.R. Le H. Tanguay R.L. Browning K.S. Plant J. 1998; 14: 715-722Crossref Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Extensive biochemical analysis of the wheat eIF3 complex showed that certain subunits of the complex were protected from trypsin digestion (39Lauer S.J. Burks E.A. Ravel J.M. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 2924-2928Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar), alkylation (40Heufler C. Browning K.S. Ravel J.M. Biochim. Biophys.

Acta. 1988; 951: 182-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). These results suggest that these subunits may be integral to the structure and therefore less solvent-accessible. Furthermore, a group of subunits was found to be resistant to dissociation by mild urea treatment, suggesting that these subunits are more tightly associated with each other within the complex (40Heufler C. Browning K.S. Ravel J.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 951: 182-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Based on the various studies of the interactions of eIF3 subunits, a model for the interaction of some of the subunits of eIF3 has been proposed (16Asano K. Phan L. Anderson J. Hinnebusch A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18573-18585Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 35Preiss T. Hentze M.W. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1999; 9: 515-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). This preliminary model suggests that the five subunits shared in common between S. cerevisiae and mammalian eIF3 may have a similar architecture. Although mammalian and S. cerevisiae eIF3 complexes have some subunits in common, they each have subunits that are unique to their respective complexes. It is important to know whether eIF3s from other eukaryotes will follow a similar pattern of containing a few common subunits but have other subunits that are unique. Higher plants represent a distinct evolutionary path from mammals and fungi. The composition of plant eIF3 should therefore give a good indication of whether eIF3 complexes from eukaryotes will have substantial differences in subunit composition. We report in this paper that the plant eIF3 subunit composition closely resembles that of mammalian eIF3, sharing 10 out of 11 subunits. The plant eIF3 complex contains a unique subunit that is not present in mammalian or S. cerevisiae eIF3. These findings suggest that the eIF3 complexes from most eukaryotes will probably have a subunit composition that is similar to the plant and mammalian complexes and that the subunit composition of the S. cerevisiae complex most likely represents a divergent evolutionary path. Wheat germ used for preparation of eIF3 and other initiation factors was purchased from Bob's Red Mill (Milwaukie, OR). Wheat eIF3 was prepared as described previously (37Lax S.R. Lauer S.J. Browning K.S. Ravel J.M.

Lauer S.J. Browning K.S. Ravel J.M. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 118: 109-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Purified wheat eIF3 was separated on a 10 × 15-cm-long, 1.0-mm-thick, 15% Laemmli SDS gel (15% acrylamide, 0.55% bisacrylamide) and blotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membrane and stained with Ponceau S. The membrane was sent to Dr. John Leszyk (Protein Microsequencing Laboratory, University of Massachusetts Medical School, Worcester, MA) for trypsin digestion and peptide sequence analysis. Suspension cultures of A. thaliana (Columbia University) were obtained from Dr. A. N. S. Reddy (Colorado State University) and maintained on Murashige and Skoog (MS) medium containing, per liter, 4.3 g of MS basal salts (Sigma), 30 g of sucrose (Sigma), 1.0 ml of 1000× MS vitamins (Sigma), and 0.5 mg of 2,4-diphenoxyacetic acid (Sigma). The medium was adjusted with KOH to a pH of 5.7 before autoclaving. Suspension cultures were maintained by transferring every 7 days 1 part of stationary stage culture to 4 parts fresh MS medium in an Erlenmeyer flask that was 2.5–5 times larger than the final volume. The flasks were rotated at 115 rpm on a gyratory shaker at 26 °C in the dark. Cells from 7-day suspension cultures were harvested by pouring cultures through eight layers of cheesecloth. The cells were rinsed with buffer containing 20 mm Hepes·KOH, pH 7.6, 14 mmMg(OAc)2, 0.1 m KOAc, and 3% sucrose. Excess liquid was squeezed from the cells by hand and transferred to dry cheesecloth as necessary. The wet weight of the cells was determined, and the cells were placed in a blender with a volume of extraction buffer (10 mm Tris·OAc, pH 8.2, 14 mmMg(OAc)2, 60 mm KOAc, 1 mmdithiothreitol, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) 2 times the wet weight of the cells. The cells and buffer were processed for ∼2 min or until smooth. The cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 30,000 × g for 40 min at 4 °C. The supernatant (S-30) was flash frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C. The supernatant was thawed and centrifuged at 150,000 × g for 3 h at 4 °C to remove ribosomes. The resulting supernatant (S-150) was flash frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C. The S150 from ∼200 g of cells was made to 40% saturation with solid ammonium sulfate, and the precipitate was collected by centrifugation at 30,000 ×g for 15 min at 4 °C. The protein pellets were resuspended in 13 ml of buffer N1 (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.6, 10% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 EDTA) containing 0.08 m KCl and dialyzed overnight against 2 liters of the same buffer. The dialyzed sample was clarified by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The dialyzed sample (∼200 mg of protein) was made 15% in glycerol and applied to a 20-ml column of Whatman DE-52 cellulose equilibrated in buffer N15 (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.6, 15% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 EDTA) containing 0.08m KCl. The column was washed with buffer N15containing 0.08 KCl until the A 280 was less than 0.1. The protein was eluted with a 5× linear gradient from 0.08m KCl to 0.4 m KCl in N15 buffer. The resulting fractions were assayed in a wheat germ translation system (37Lax S.R. Lauer S.J. Browning K.S. Ravel J.M. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 118: 109-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The eIF3 activity eluted from the column between 0.15 and 0.25m KCl. The pooled DEAE material was adjusted to 0.08 m KCl with N15 buffer containing no KCl and loaded onto a 0.5-ml column of SP-Sepharose equilibrated in the same buffer. After loading the sample, the column was washed with N15 containing 0.08 KCl, and the eIF3 was eluted with N15 containing 0.2m KCl. Fractions with maximum specific activity were pooled. A. thaliana eIF-3 from two SP-Sepharose columns, ∼1.3 mg of protein, were pooled and concentrated 3-fold in a Centricon 10 microconcentrator (Amicon) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The concentrated sample, ∼400 μl, was applied to a 13.2-ml 15–40% glycerol gradient in 20 mm Hepes·KOH, pH 7.6, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1.0 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.2 m KCl. A sample of 0.74 mg in 400 μl of purified wheat eIF3 was applied to a second gradient. The gradients were centrifuged at 21,000 × g at 4 °C in a Beckman SW 41 Ti rotor for 18 h. Fractions of 0.3 ml were collected and assayed for eIF3 activity and protein concentration by the method of Bradford (41Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (211983) Google Scholar). About 50 μg of A. thaliana eIF3 or wheat eIF3 from the glycerol gradients were precipitated with methanol and chloroform to remove the glycerol and salts (42Wessel D. Fluegge U.I. Anal. Biochem. 1984; 138: 141-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (3108) Google Scholar). The precipitates were collected in a microcentrifuge tube and air-dried. The resulting pellets were dissolved in 40 μl of 1× Laemmli SDS gel loading buffer and applied to a 10 × 15-cm-long, 1.0-mm-thick, 15% Laemmli SDS gel containing 14.45% acrylamide and 0.55% bisacrylamide (43Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205531) Google Scholar). The gel was electrophoresed at a constant current of 20 mA until the bromphenol blue tracking dye ran off the bottom. The gel was stained in 45% methanol, 10% acetic acid with 0.25% Coomassie Brilliant Blue R dye and destained. The individual bands of A. thaliana were cut from the gel and digested with trypsin prior to analysis by mass spectroscopy (44Takada Y. Nakayama K. Yoshida M. Sakairi M. Rapid Commun. Mass Spectrom. 1994; 8: 695-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The peptides were separated by HPLC on a Varian 9000 using a 10-cm, 1-mm (inner diameter) C18 column. The mass spectrometry was carried out on a Finnegan MAT LCQ mass spectrometer in the mass spectrometry facility of the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, University of Texas at Austin (Dr. Mehdy Moini, Director). To determine which of the wheat eIF3 subunits correlated with the mammalian or S. cerevisiae eIF3 subunits, it was necessary to obtain protein sequence information. Tryptic peptides were prepared from a highly purified preparation of wheat eIF3 separated by SDS-PAGE. The peptide sequences obtained for each subunit of wheat eIF3 are shown in Table I. The peptide sequences were compared with GenBankTM to find potential matches. The p41 subunit of wheat eIF3 gave three peptides that corresponded to two different human eIF3 subunits, indicating that two polypeptides of different sequences migrate with the same mobility on SDS-PAGE. Previous work from this laboratory showed that the wheat p41 subunit separated into two distinct isoelectric species of pH 5.3 and 7.2 (40Heufler C. Browning K.S. Ravel J.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 951: 182-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). The combination of peptide analysis and two-dimensional gel data shows that wheat p41 is really two distinct polypeptides with the same SDS-PAGE mobility. Further, quantitation of the band intensities of the wheat eIF3 subunits shown in Fig. 3 suggests that there are two proteins at this position relative to the other subunits. Except for wheat eIF3-p56, matches to mammalian and/or S. cerevisiaeeIF3 subunits were found using wheat peptides. The correlation of wheat subunits to mammalian subunits is shown in Table I. A nomenclature is proposed based upon the mammalian eIF3 subunits and gives a letter designation, rather than a molecular weight designation (see TableII). The proposed nomenclature is flexible enough to allow for the differences in subunit composition and to accommodate any additions as more is learned about the subunits and associated proteins from different organisms.Table ISequence of tryptic peptides of wheat eIF3 subunitsWheat eIF3 subunitSequence of tryptic peptideCorresponding mammalian eIF3 subunitp116DLYNLMEHEFLPLDLp170p107MMMHDELHASWDQPTp110p87VTFDEPNPFASENEEAAPVCYRp66p83VPDEWAPAEIKPYTPGENLLKp116AGTFTEVYWNDARp56DTPWPSAEAVAPYCDGDHVFLLLYRNone foundFDDEAYAAYDELFSYACPKp45LAAEILMQNWDVAQEELNRp48p41aSVDLAIGDHLAVITTDSFMp36p41bLSWVDIFEEIPIKp40SFLQAMSTVTEEAAVPLRp36WGELEEDDGGDLDFLLPPRp44p34EVQSPIHLTYDTGFTMGEASIKp47p28ALMAMPAPDEFSLCLEFLIPEHVQMEEp28FMEYHAANSGWVIEK Open table in a new tab The plantA. thaliana genome and expressed sequence tag (EST) projects have provided a wealth of easily obtained sequence information.

A full-length A. thaliana EST for the p56 subunit (eIF3l) is currently not available. A partial gene sequence is located on a bacterial artificial chromosome derived fromA. thaliana chromosome 5, but a bacterial artificial chromosome with the complete gene sequence for this novel subunit has not been deposited in the data base. A complete rice gene was identified using the wheat peptides and used for sequence comparison purposes in this report (see below). The ESTs for eIF3a, eIF3d, eIF3e, eIF3g, eIF3h, and eIF3k were obtained from the Arabidopsis Biological Resource Center (Ohio State University) and completely sequenced.

https://openalex.org/W2013469964,"Optimal production of red cells in vivo requires collaboration between c-Kit, erythropoietin receptor (Epo-R), and GATA-1. However, the mechanism(s) of collaboration remain unclear. Utilizing an embryonic stem cell-derived erythroid progenitor cell line from mice deficient in GATA-1, we have examined the role of c-Kit and Epo-R in erythroid cell proliferation, survival, and differentiation. In the absence of GATA-1, we demonstrate an essential role for c-Kit in survival and proliferation of erythroid progenitors via the regulation of Bcl-2 expression. In addition, we demonstrate that Epo-R and Stat5 are regulated by a second, novel mechanism. We demonstrate that c-Kit stimulation by stem cell factor is essential for the maintenance of Epo-R and Stat5 protein expression, which results in significantly enhanced Bcl-xL induction and survival of erythroid progenitors in response to Epo stimulation. Restoration of GATA-1 function results in terminal erythroid maturation and up-regulation of Epo-R and Bcl-xL expression, leading also to significantly enhanced survival of terminally differentiating erythroid progenitors in the presence of only Epo. These results demonstrate that c-Kit and Epo-R have unique role(s) during distinct phases of erythroid maturation, and both stem cell factor and Epo contribute to the regulation of the Epo-R-Stat5-Bcl-xL pathway to ensure optimal survival, proliferation, and differentiation of erythroid progenitors."

Upon phosphorylation by its type I receptor, Smad2 or Smad3 forms a complex with Smad4 and translocates to the nucleus where the complex activates target gene transcription. In the present study, we report that Smad3 binds directly to the osteopontin (OPN) promoter and that Smad4 interacts with the Hox protein and displaces it from its cognate DNA binding site in response to TGF-β stimulation. In gel shift assays, the glutathione S-transferase-Smad3 fusion protein was found to bind to a 50-base pair DNA element (−179 to −229) from the OPN promoter. Also, we found that both Hoxc-8 and Hoxa-9 bound to a Hox binding site adjacent to Smad3 binding sequence. Interestingly, Smad4, the common partner for both bone morphogenic protein and TGF-β signaling pathways, inhibited the binding of Hox protein to DNA. FLAG-tagged Smad4 coimmunoprecipitated with HA-tagged Hoxa-9 from cotransfected COS-1 cells, demonstrating an interaction between Smad4 and Hoxa-9. Transfection studies showed that Hoxa-9 is a strong transcriptional repressor; it suppresses the transcription of the luciferase reporter gene driven by a 124-base pair OPN promoter fragment containing both Smad3 and Hox binding sites. Taken together, these data demonstrate a unique TGF-β-induced transcription mechanism. Smad3 and Smad4 exhibit different functions in activation of OPN transcription.

TGF-β is also one of the most abundant of the known growth factors stored within the bone matrix. When bone is resorbed during remodeling, TGF-β is released and stimulates the proliferation of precursor cells of osteoblast lineage, which induces new bone formation (1Noda M. Camilliere J.J.

Here we show evidence that the DNA-binding protein Hoxa-9 interacts with Smad4, but not with Smad3 (which binds to OPN promoter), and the interaction between Smad4 and Hoxa-9 results in the transcriptional activation of OPN in response to TGF-β stimulation. Also, unlike most DNA-binding proteins interacting with Smads that are transcriptional activators, Hoxa-9 functions as a strong transcriptional repressor, similar to Hoxc-8.

A BamHI and an XbaI restriction site (bold) was added to the upstream and downstream primers, respectively. The polymerase chain reaction product was cut with XbaI and inserted between the EcoRI (blunted with S1 nuclease) and XbaI sites of the PcDNA3-HA-Hoxc-8 (40Shi X.M. Yang X. Chen D. Chang Z. Cao X. J.

BL21 bacterial cells were transformed with the GST fusion constructs described above, and the fusion proteins were purified by glutathione-agarose 4B (Sigma) following induction with isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside as described previously (41Shi X.M.

A 50-bp SBE (Smad binding element) corresponding to nucleotides − 179 to −229, and a 25-bp Smad binding element (used in Fig. 4) corresponding to nucleotides −203 to −228 of the OPN promoter region were generated by annealing pairs of oligonucleotides (sense strands are shown). 5′-CTAAATGCAGTCTATAAATGAAAAGGGTAGTTAATGACATCGTTCATCAG-3′ for SBE (underlined sequences were changed to ACCCTT and GCGC, respectively, in mutant probe m-SBE), and 5′-CTAAATGCAGTCTATAAATGAAAAG-3′ for Smad binding element. The probe OPN5 used in Fig. 5 was described previously (40Shi X.M. Yang X. Chen D. Chang Z. Cao X. J. Biol.

The subsequent experiment was performed as described previously (41Shi X.M. Blair H.C. Yang X. McDonald J.M. Cao X. J. Cell. Biochem. 2000; 76: 518-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). For supershift assays, anti-FLAG M2 antibody (Eastman Kodak Co.) was added to the binding reaction and incubated for an additional 10 min at room temperature.Figure 5Smad4, but not Smad2 or Smad3, inhibits Hoxa-9 binding to DNA.

Twenty-four hours post-transfection, the cells were switched to Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 0.2% fetal bovine serum for 12 h and then treated with 10 ng/ml TGF-β1 (R & D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) for 30 min where appropriate. The cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-HA polyclonal antiserum (Babco, Berkeley, CA) and immunoblotted with anti-FLAG M2 monoclonal antibody (Kodak) as described previously (41Shi X.M. Blair H.C. Yang X. McDonald J.M. Cao X. J. Cell. Biochem. 2000; 76: 518-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). For the gel shift assay (see Fig. 4), the cells were treated with 10 ng/ml TGF-β1 for 12 h before cells were lysed. Mv1Lu cells were transiently transfected with the constructs indicated in Fig. 1 using a mixture of cationic and neutral lipids (Tfx-50, Promega) as described previously (41Shi X.M. Blair H.C. Yang X. McDonald J.M. Cao X. J. Cell. Biochem. 2000; 76: 518-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). When increasing amounts of expression vectors were transfected, total DNA was kept constant by addition of PcDNA3 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). An internal control plasmid pRL-SV40 was cotransfected to monitor the transfection efficiency. Luciferase activities were assayed 48 h post-transfection with separate substrates to detect the luciferase (firefly) in the promoter-luciferase reporter plasmid and to the second luciferase (Renilla), encoded by the pRL-SV40 vector (dual luciferase assay kit, Promega) according to the manufacturer's directions. Values were normalized to the renilla luciferase activity expressed from the pRL-SV40 reporter plasmid. Luciferase values shown in the figures are representative of transfection experiments performed in triplicate in at least three independent experiments. To investigate the molecular basis of TGF-β-induced OPN expression, the effect of TGF-β on OPN promoter activity was tested. Hox-pGL3 (Fig.1 A), a previously characterized OPN promoter-luciferase reporter (40Shi X.M. Yang X. Chen D. Chang Z. Cao X. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13711-13717Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar), was used. Hox-pGL3 contains a 124-bp OPN promoter fragment (nucleotides −166 to −290) inserted upstream of SV40 promoter in the pGL3-control vector. This 124-bp fragment contains a SBE (nucleotides −217 to −222) and a well characterized Hox binding site (TAAT, nucleotides −195 to −198) separated by 20 base pairs. Mv1Lu cells, a TGF-β-responsive cell line, were transiently transfected with Hox-pGL3 reporter construct. The transfected cells were then incubated in the presence or absence of 5 ng/ml TGF-β for 48 h before the luciferase activity was assayed. As shown in Fig. 1 B, treatment of transfected cells with TGF-β stimulated OPN promoter-reporter activity more than 5-fold. To verify whether SBE is involved in the TGF-β-induced transcriptional activity, a shorter, mutant version of OPN promoter-luciferase reporter was constructed (nucleotides −168 to −229) in pGL3-control vector (Fig. 1 A). This 61-bp OPN promoter reporter construct (mSBE-pGL3) bears four nucleotide alterations in the Smad binding sequence (CAGTCT to CCATGG). Transfection study showed that mutation of the Smad binding site greatly reduced the basal and TGF-β-induced reporter activity. These results suggested that the TGF-β-induced OPN gene transcription is mediated via the SBE and that the direct binding of Smad3 to OPN promoter might be required for its gene activation. Previous studies showed that Hoxc-8 inhibits OPN gene transcription in BMP signaling pathway through a functional Hox binding site adjacent to the SBE (40Shi X.M. Yang X. Chen D. Chang Z. Cao X. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13711-13717Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Therefore, we examined whether this Hox binding element is also involved in TGF-β signaling. A Hoxa-9 expression vector (HA-Hoxa-9) was cotransfected with Hox-pGL3, mSBE-pGL3, or mHox-pGL3 reporter construct. As shown in Fig. 1 B, coexpression of a small amount of Hoxa-9 (50 ng of HA-Hoxa-9 plasmid DNA) significantly inhibited the promoter reporter activities of both wild-type (Hox-pGL3) and SBE mutated (mSBE-pGL3) constructs in the presence or absence of TGF-β treatment. However, Hoxa-9 was unable to inhibit TGF-β-induced reporter activity when hox binding site was mutated (mHox-pGL3, Fig. 1 C). These results indicate that Hoxa-9 negatively regulates TGF-β-induced OPN gene transcription via this hox site. Binding of Hoxa-9 to this Hox binding element was examined in gel shift assays. As shown in Fig. 2, GST-Hoxa-9 bound to this DNA element (lane 3). The specificity of the binding was demonstrated by competition shift assays using unlabeled specific probe (lanes 4–6), as well as nonspecific probe (lanes 7–9). The GST itself did not bind to this probe (lane 2). Lane 1 is the probe with no added protein. These results suggest that the inhibitory effect of Hoxa-9 on the OPN promoter is mediated via the Hox binding site. We then investigated if the direct binding of Smad2 or Smad3 to OPN promoter is required. Gel shift assays were performed using affinity-purified GST-Smad2 or GST-Smad3 fusion protein and a 50-bp DNA fragment containing SBE (−179 to −229). Fig. 3 A shows that GST-Smad3 effectively bound to SBE (lane 3), while GST-Smad2 bound weakly (data not shown). Thus, we focused attention on Smad3. The specificity of Smad3 binding was shown in a competition shift assay. Unlabeled SBE dose-dependently competed for Smad3 binding (lanes 4–6), and a 100-fold excess of it completely competed off Smad3 binding (lane 6). In contrast, an equal molar amount of a nonspecific probe did not show such an effect (lanes 7–9). GST-Smad4, the common partner for all pathway-specific Smads, did not bind to SBE (lane 10), nor did it affect Smad3 binding activity (lanes 11–13). To validate the DNA sequence in the SBE that confers the binding of Smad3, the core sequences CAGTCT for SBE and TAAT for Hox protein binding sites were mutated to ACCCTT and GCCG, respectively. As shown in Fig.3 B, mutations of SBE abolished binding of Smad3 (Fig.3 B, compare lane 7 to wild-type probe, lane 3). Studies have shown that the MH1 domain, but not the full length of Smad3, is able to bind DNA (41Shi X.M. Blair H.C. Yang X. McDonald J.M. Cao X. J. Cell. Biochem. 2000; 76: 518-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 42Dennler S. Itoh S. Vivien D. Ten D.P. Huet S. Gauthier J.M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3091-3100Crossref PubMed Scopus (1588) Google Scholar). Under our experimental conditions, however, full-length GST-Smad3 was found to bind to OPN promoter effectively (Fig. 3). To confirm that the full length of mammalian cell-expressed Smad3 also bound to the SBE, COS-1 cells were transfected with Smad3-FLAG expression vector. The transfected cells were treated with or without TGF-β (10 ng/ml) for 12 h before lysates were prepared, then gel shift assays were performed using the SBE probe. Western blot demonstrated that Smad3 was only expressed in the cells transfected with the Smad expression plasmid (Fig.4 B). As shown in Fig.4 A, a shifted band is seen from both TGF-β-treated and untreated lysates of Smad3-FLAG transfected cells (lanes 4and 5). In contrast, the lysates from control cells did not yield such a band (lanes 2 and 3). To verify the presence of FLAG-tagged Smad3 in this new complex, anti-FLAG M2 antibody was added to the binding reaction. The addition of antibodies disrupted the newly formed DNA-protein complex (lanes 8 and 9), indicating that the complex contained FLAG-tagged Smad3.Lane 1 contained no protein, demonstrating the quality of the probe. Previously we have shown that Smad1 interacts with Hoxc-8 in response to BMP stimulation (40Shi X.M. Yang X. Chen D. Chang Z. Cao X. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13711-13717Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). To test whether TGF-β regulatory Smads interact with Hoxa-9 in a way similar to the interaction between Smad1 and Hoxc-8 in regulation of gene expression, GST-Smad2, -Smad3, or -Smad4 was coincubated with GST-Hoxa-9 in the binding reaction for gel shift assays. Neither GST-Smad2 nor GST-Smad3 interacted with GST-Hoxa-9 (Fig.5, lanes 4 and 5). GST-Smad4, which did not bind to SBE, inhibited Hoxa-9 binding (Fig. 5,lane 6; Fig. 2, lanes 10–13). Addition of Smad2 or Smad3 did not enhance the inhibitory effect of Smad4 on Hoxa-9 binding (Fig. 5, lanes 7 and 8). Furthermore, the interaction of TGF-β regulatory Smads with Hoxa-9 was examined in mammalian cells. The carboxyl-terminally FLAG-tagged Smad3/Smad4 (Smad3/Smad4-FLAG) and amino-terminally HA-tagged Hoxa-9 (HA-Hoxa-9) were coexpressed in COS-1 cells in the presence or absence of TGF-β (10 ng/ml) stimulation. Whole cell extract immunoprecipitations were performed using anti-HA antibodies followed by Western blot with anti-FLAG M2 antibodies. In the presence of coexpressed Hoxa-9, Smad4 was coimmunoprecipitated (Fig. 6,lanes 5–8, top). In contrast, Smad3 did not interact with Hoxa-9 (lanes 3 and 4), which is consistent with gel shift assay results (Fig. 5). TGF-β stimulation neither enhanced the interaction between Smad4 and Hoxa-9 (compare lane 5 with lane 6), nor did it induce the formation of Hoxa-9-Smad3/4 complex (compare lane 7 with lane 8). These results are also in agreement with the observations in the gel shift assays that Smad4, but not Smad3 or Smad2, interacts with Hoxa-9 (Fig. 5). Since Smad3 and Smad4 are known to form a heteromeric complex and translocate to the nucleus in response to TGF-β stimulation (36Hua X. Liu X. Ansari D. Lodish H.F. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3084-3095Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar, 42Dennler S. Itoh S. Vivien D. Ten D.P. Huet S. Gauthier J.M.

EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5353-5362Crossref PubMed Scopus (916) Google Scholar), it seems that both Smad3 and Hoxa-9 would compete for binding to Smad4. However, in the presence of Hoxa-9, the association of Smad3 with Smad4 was not seen (Fig. 6, lanes 7 and 8). Apparently, Smad4 prefers to interact with Hoxa-9. This could be due to a higher affinity between Smad4 and Hoxa-9 or another specific mechanism. Nevertheless, release of Smad3 as a result of Smad4/Hoxa-9 interaction allows Smad3 to bind OPN promoter as a part of the transcription mechanism. In summary, we have located a 50-bp DNA fragment (−179 to −229) in the OPN promoter to be responsible for mediating TGF-β-induced OPN gene transcription. It is interesting to note that this 50-bp fragment contains a functional Smad3 and a Hox binding sites. Mutations of these two sites abolished both Smad3 and Hoxa-9 binding activities (Fig.3 B). Disruption of the Smad binding site reduced basal promoter activity significantly, but did not abolish the TGF-β-induced OPN gene transcription (Fig. 1). This is likely due to the interactions of endogenous Smad4 with Hox proteins, since the endogenous Smad2 and -3 will associate with Smad4 and take it into the nucleus upon TGF-β stimulation where Smad4, in turn, interacts with and dislodges Hox proteins from their cognate binding sites. As shown in our previous studies, mutation of the Hox binding site in Hox-pGL3 reporter construct elevates the basal promoter activity and de-represses the inhibitory effects of Hox proteins on this promoter-luciferase reporter (40Shi X.M. Yang X. Chen D. Chang Z. Cao X. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13711-13717Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Our previous studies have shown that Hoxc-8 is the downstream transcription factor of the BMP signaling pathway and that BMP-2 activates OPN gene transcription through an interaction between Smad1 and Hoxc-8. The results of this study show that Hox binding element is also involved in the TGF-β-induced OPN gene transcription via an interaction between Hoxa-9 and Smad4 and that Smad3 directly binds to the OPN promoter in response to TGF-β. It is well established that phosphorylated Smad3 associates with Smad4 and translocates to nucleus as a complex. Smad4 is not required for nuclear accumulation but for the formation of functional complexes. However, it is not clear whether Smad4 and Smad3 still remain as complex in participating transcription after translocation to nucleus. Our data indicate that Smad4 and Smad3 can function separately in activation of OPN gene transcription. While Smad4 displaces transcriptional repressor, Hoxa-9, from its binding site, Smad3 directly binds to OPN promoter as a sequence specific activator. We are grateful to C. Largman for kindly providing the Hoxa-9 cDNA clone and to Rik Derynck for the Smad2, -3, and -4 expression vectors."

It is one of the major tyrosine-phosphorylated molecules in v-Src-transformed cells. Dok consists of an amino-terminal Pleckstrin homology domain, a putative phosphotyrosine binding domain, and a carboxyl-terminal tail containing multiple tyrosine phosphorylation sites. The importance and function of these sequences in Dok signaling remain largely unknown. We have demonstrated here that the expression of Dok can inhibit cellular transformation by the Src tyrosine kinase. Both the phosphotyrosine binding domain and the carboxyl-terminal tail of Dok (in particular residues 336–363) are necessary for such activity. Using a combinatorial peptide library approach, we have shown that the Dok phosphotyrosine binding domain binds phosphopeptides with the consensus motif of Y/MXXNXL-phosphotyrosine. Furthermore, Dok can homodimerize through its phosphotyrosine binding domain and Tyr146 at the amino-terminal region. Mutations of this domain or Tyr146 that block homodimerization significantly reduce the ability of Dok to inhibit Src transformation. Our results suggest that Dok oligomerization through its multiple domains plays a critical role in Dok signaling in response to tyrosine kinase activation. p62Dok, the rasGAP-binding protein, is a common target of protein-tyrosine kinases.

Dok consists of an amino-terminal Pleckstrin homology (PH) domain, a putative phosphotyrosine binding (PTB) domain, and a carboxyl-terminal tail harboring at least seven potential tyrosine phosphorylation sites (4Yamanashi Y.

The PH domain is likely to be necessary for targeting Dok to the membrane, because PH domains preferentially bind phospholipids (7Harlan J.E. Hajduk P.J. Yoon H.S. Fesik S.W. Nature. 1994; 371: 168-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (673) Google Scholar). The putative PTB domain is most homologous to the IRS-1 and FRS2/SNT-1 PTB domains, which recognize phosphotyrosine (pY)-containing sequences (8Wolf G. Trub T. Ottinger E. Groninga L. Lynch A.

Gotoh N. Schlessinger J. Lax I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 979-989Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). It remains to be determined whether the Dok PTB domain can bind phosphopeptides and, if it does, whether it recognizes sequences distinct from those recognized by the IRS-1 and SNT-1 PTB domains. The multiple tyrosine residues in the Dok carboxyl-terminal tail are candidate sites for tyrosine kinases. When phosphorylated, they become potential docking sites for Src homology 2-containing proteins such as p120 rasGAP and Nck (5Holland S.J. Gale N.W. Gish G.D. Roth R.A. Songyang Z. Cantley L.C.

Therefore, the carboxyl-terminal tail of Dok likely functions as a molecular platform for signal complex assembly induced by activated PTKs. However, the functional significance of the Dok PTB domain and the carboxyl-terminal tail has yet to be addressed. Additional Dok homologues such as Dok-L (or Dok-3) and Dok-R (or Dok-2 and FRIP) have been identified recently (14Nelms K. Snow A.L. Hu-Li J. Paul W.E.

Biol. 2000; 20: 2743-2754Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar), indicating that Dok and its homologues may constitute a growing family of proteins involved in a range of signaling pathways downstream of PTKs. However, the physiological roles of Dok and its homologues remain to be elucidated. Despite their structural similarities to the IRS-1 family molecules, Dok family proteins have different PTB domains and carboxyl-terminal tails that potentially mediate different signal responses by recruiting distinct sets of Src homology 2-containing signaling molecules. The mechanism by which Dok is phosphorylated and primed to form specific signaling complexes thus becomes a key issue in understanding Dok signaling. We have demonstrated here that the Dok PTB domain is a functional phosphotyrosine binding module that facilitates tyrosine phosphorylation and rasGAP binding of Dok. We have also found that Dok can inhibit Src-induced cellular transformation. This inhibitory effect depends on both the PTB domain and the carboxyl-terminal tail of Dok. Furthermore, we have shown that Dok can oligomerize via its PTB domain and Tyr146. This oligomerization appears critical for the inhibition of v-Src-induced transformation. These results suggest that the multiple domains of Dok are required for Dok signaling. NIH3T3 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's media containing 10% calf serum (Hyclone).

Anti-Ras monoclonal antibody was from Upstate Biotechnology. The coding region of the murine Dok cDNA (4Yamanashi Y. Baltimore D. Cell. 1997; 88: 205-211Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar) tagged with the HA epitope was cloned into the HpaI site of the murine stem cell retroviral vector MSCVpuro (19Hawley R.G. Lieu F.H. Fong A.Z. Hawley T.S. Gene Ther. 1994; 1: 136-138PubMed Google Scholar). The HA epitope was joined to the 5′ end of Dok cDNA by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using the pfu polymerase (4Yamanashi Y. Baltimore D. Cell. 1997; 88: 205-211Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). The carboxyl-terminal truncated forms of Dok were similarly cloned. The Dok 277, 313, 336, and 363 constructs encode amino acids 1–277, 313, 336, and 363, respectively. The PTB domain mutant Dok-AA (Arg207 and Arg208 to Ala) and the Y146F mutants (DokN-Y146F, Dok313-Y146F, and Dok363-Y146F) were generated by site-directed mutagenesis using PCR with the pfu polymerase. All constructs were confirmed by DNA sequencing. Sequences encoding wild-type (chicken c-Src) or activated (Src527F) Src were cloned into the MSCV-neo vector as described previously (20Alexandropoulos K. Baltimore D. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1341-1355Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). The MSCV-based constructs encoding Src and HA-Dok and their variants were transfected into the retrovirus packaging cell line BOSC23 (21Pear W.S. Nolan G.P. Scott M.L. Baltimore D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8392-8396Crossref PubMed Scopus (2298) Google Scholar). Retroviruses were harvested 2 days after transfection and used to infect dividing NIH3T3 cells. Two days after infection, Dok- or Src-expressing cells were selected in puromycin- or G418-containing media. Cells that coexpressed Dok and Src were generated by infecting Dok-expressing cells again with Src viruses followed by selection in G418-containing media. The ability of Src to induce cellular transformation was scored by the focus formation assay in NIH3T3 cells. Parental and Dok variant-expressing cells were infected by low titer (1 × 104/ml) MSCV-c-Src or MSCV-Src527F viruses. These cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's media containing 10% calf serum for 7–10 days for focus formation. The number of foci were then quantitated to determine transformation activities. Three replicate dishes were plated for each sample, and each experiment was repeated three times. To generate the glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion protein construct containing only the amino-terminal PH and PTB domains of Dok (GST-DokN), the DNA fragment encompassing residues 1–277 of murine Dok was PCR-amplified and cloned into the SmaI site of the pGEX4T-1 vector (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Similarly, to generate the GST-PTB and GST-PTB-AA constructs, the DNA fragment encoding residues 125–264 was PCR-amplified using wild-type Dok or Dok-AA as a template. These fragments were subsequently cloned into theBamHI site of pGEX4T-1. These constructs were used to transform Escherichia coli to produce GST fusion proteins that were purified using glutathione-agarose beads. To study the binding specificity of the Dok PTB domain, 100–200 μg of fusion proteins that were immobilized on glutathione-agarose beads were incubated with 1 mg of peptide library. The peptide library had a sequence of MAXXNXXpYXAKKK, whereX indicates any amino acid except Cys and Trp. This particular library was designed to examine PTB domain specificities, because PTB domains prefer turn-forming sequences near pY and hydrophobic residues at 5–8 positions amino-terminal to pY (22Songyang Z. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 1999; 71: 359-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The mixture of peptides bound to the fusion proteins was eluted with acid after washing. This peptide mixture was then sequenced on an ABI477 machine. The specificity of binding was then determined by comparing the sequence of bound mixture with that of the mock experiment using GST alone (12Songyang Z. Shoelson S.E. Chaudhuri M. Gish G. Pawson T. Haser W.G. King F. Roberts T. Ratnofsky S. Lechleider R.J. Neel B.G., R.B.B. Fajardo J.E. Chou M.M. Hanafusa H. Schaffhausen B. Cantley L.C. Cell. 1993; 72: 767-778Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2381) Google Scholar). To generate poly-His-tagged Dok (His-DokN) fusion proteins, sequences encoding residues 1–264 of Dok were PCR-amplified and cloned into theBamHI site of the pRSET vector (Invitrogen). His-DokN-Y146F was constructed in the same manner, except that Tyr146 was mutated to Phe. His-tagged proteins were purified from BL21 cells using nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (Qiagen) and eluted with immidazole. To phosphorylate these fusion proteins, they were incubated with 2 μg of purified recombinant c-Src (a generous gift from Dr. Wenqing Xu, University of Washington) in the presence of 1 mm ATP and 20 mm MgCl2 for 1 h at 30 °C. Cells were washed once with PBS, lysed in the lysis buffer (20 mmTris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm phenlymethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μm pepstatin A, 1 μm aprotinin, 1 μm leupeptin, 2 mm β-glyerolphosphate, 500 μm sodium vanadate, and 1 mmdithiothreitol), and centrifuged at 10,000 × g at 4 °C. The supernatants were subsequently collected for immunobloting and immunoprecipitation. For immunobloting, 110 of the supernatants was mixed with SDS-loading buffer, boiled, and analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. For immunoprecipitation, the supernatants were incubated with antibodies at 4 °C for 90 min. Protein A/G-agarose beads were then added, and the mixture was incubated at 4 °C for another 90 min. The beads were subsequently washed four times with lysis buffer, resuspended in SDS-loading buffer, and boiled, and the eluents were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and Western blot analyses were performed as described previously (4Yamanashi Y. Baltimore D. Cell. 1997; 88: 205-211Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). For analyzing the effect of Dok expression on Ras GTP loading in Src-transformed cells, GST-Raf Ras binding domain-agarose beads (Ras Activation Assay kit, Upstate Biotechnology) were used to precipitate GTP-bound Ras as described in the manufacturer's manual. A monoclonal antibody against Ras was also supplied in the kit and used to probe for endogenous Ras. Although tyrosine phosphorylation of Dok occurs concurrently with PTK activation, the exact role of Dok in cell signaling remains ambiguous. To address the question of whether Dok facilitates or inhibits Src transformation, we examined the effect of Dok expression on Src-induced transformation in NIH3T3 cells. Dok and Src retroviruses (see “Experimental Procedures”) were used to infect NIH3T3 cells. As shown in Fig. 1, A andB, expression of c-Src or activated Src (Src527F) readily induced focus formation within 1 week. However, coexpression of Dok and Src strongly inhibited focus formation induced by Src. Although Dok is commonly phosphorylated by oncogenic tyrosine kinases, this result indicates that the physiological effect of DOK is to inhibit cellular transformation by the Src-tyrosine kinase. Because Dok consists of multiple domains, we went on to map the functional domains in Dok that are responsible for its inhibitory effects. Mutant Dok molecules that were HA epitope-tagged were generated and coexpressed with Src in NIH3T3 cells. We postulated that the multiple potential tyrosine phosphorylation sites within the Dok carboxyl terminus might contribute to Dok inhibition of Src transformation. Consistent with this notion, deletion of the carboxyl-terminal tail (Dok277) abolished the inhibitory activity of Dok (Fig. 1 B). Using a panel of carboxyl-terminal deletion constructs, we further defined the regions within the Dok carboxyl terminus necessary for transformation inhibition. Although Dok363 still blocked Src transformation, Dok313 and Dok336 no longer retained the inhibitory abilities (Fig.1 B). These data indicate that the residues between 336 and 363 constitute a functional domain for the inhibitory action of Dok. To determine the role of the amino-terminal portion, mutations were made in the putative PTB domain of Dok. On the basis of sequence homology with the IRS-1 PTB domain (4Yamanashi Y. Baltimore D. Cell. 1997; 88: 205-211Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar), amino acids Arg207and Arg222 of Dok are predicted to coordinate phosphotyrosine binding. We therefore reasoned that mutation of Arg207 might block phosphotyrosine binding and thereby affect Dok function. Supporting our hypothesis, mutation of Arg207 and Arg208 to Ala residues (Dok-AA) eliminated the inhibitory function of Dok (Fig. 1 B). These results strongly suggest that the Dok amino-terminal PTB domain represents a distinct regulatory domain of Dok that may associate with tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins. Because tyrosine phosphorylation of Dok may be critical for its in vivo activities, we examined tyrosine phosphorylation of various HA-tagged Dok mutants in Src527F-transformed NIH3T3 fibroblasts. The different Dok proteins including the PTB domain mutant (Dok-AA) and all carboxyl-terminal deletion mutants (Dok277, -313, -336, and -363) were expressed (Fig. 2, A andB). Western blots of whole cell lysates indicated that they were all tyrosine-phosphorylated (data not shown). Surprisingly, Western blots of anti-HA immunoprecipitates that were probed with anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies showed that even Dok277 (which lacks the carboxyl-terminal region with its multiple potential phosphorylation sites) was still tyrosine-phosphorylated (Fig.2 B), suggesting that a major tyrosine phosphorylation site is located in the amino-terminal domain of Dok. Therefore, changes in the gross tyrosine phosphorylation levels of various Dok mutants induced by the Src PTK may not account for the differences in their inhibitory abilities. However, phosphorylation of specific tyrosine sites on Dok may be necessary for inhibition of Src-mediated transfromation. We have shown here that the Dok PTB domain (residues 125–264) is functional and necessary for Dok to inhibit Src-induced transformation, possibly through its interaction with phosphotyrosine-containing proteins. However, whether the Dok PTB domain does indeed bind specific phosphotyrosine-containing sequences remains to be determined. To this end, we used a combinatorial peptide library approach (see “Experimental Procedures”). Briefly, GST fusion proteins containing either the Dok amino-terminal PH and PTB domains (GST-DokN) or the Dok PTB domain alone (GST-PTB) were purified and captured on GSH beads. The beads were then incubated with a soluble degenerate phosphopeptide library mixture to select for specific peptides that would bind to the PTB domains. The peptide library used had a sequence of MAXXNXXpYXAKKK. The amino acid at position −3 to the phosphotyrosine was fixed (Asn), because PTB domains prefer turn-forming sequences (9Shoelson S.E. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 1997; 1: 227-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 22Songyang Z. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 1999; 71: 359-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The phosphopeptide mixtures that bound specifically to the Dok PTB domain were then isolated and sequenced by Edman degradation. A comparison of these sequences to those obtained using GST alone revealed that the Dok PTB domain recognizes phosphopeptides with the unique motif of Y/MXXNXLpY (Fig.3). At position pY-1, Leu was exclusively selected, indicating the importance of this residue. At position pY-6, hydrophobic amino acids Tyr, Met, and Phe were strongly selected. Similar preferences for hydrophobic residues at positions pY-5 to pY-8 have been reported for other PTB domains as well (8Wolf G. Trub T. Ottinger E. Groninga L. Lynch A. White M.F. Miyazaki M. Lee J. Shoelson S.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27407-27410Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar, 22Songyang Z. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 1999; 71: 359-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). A region within the Dok PTB domain (amino acids 204–232) is 41 and 52% identical to those of IRS-1 and SNT-1, respectively. The latter two PTB domains bind phosphopeptides with the consensus motif of NPXpY (8Wolf G. Trub T. Ottinger E. Groninga L. Lynch A. White M.F. Miyazaki M. Lee J. Shoelson S.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27407-27410Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar, 9Shoelson S.E. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 1997; 1: 227-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 10Kouhara H. Hadari Y.R. Spivak-Kroizman T. Schilling J. Bar-Sagi D. Lax I. Schlessinger J. Cell. 1997; 89: 693-702Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (724) Google Scholar, 11Ong S.H. Guy G.R. Hadari Y.R. Laks S. Gotoh N. Schlessinger J. Lax I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 979-989Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). Importantly, two critical Arg residues (Arg207 and Arg222) that are known to mediate phosphotyrosine recognition in the IRS-1 PTB domain are conserved in the Dok PTB domain as well (Arg207 and Arg222). To test whether Arg207 also mediates the interaction between the Dok PTB domain and the phosphotyrosine moiety, we examined the Dok-AA mutant in which Arg207 was replaced with Ala. As predicted, this mutation eliminated the ability of the Dok PTB domain to bind phosphopeptides (data not shown). Combined with the observation that Dok-AA could no longer inhibit Src transformation, these data support the model that Dok function depends on the PTB domain. Furthermore, despite their similarities in the structural basis for phosphotyrosine recognition, the Dok PTB domain recognizes distinct sequences (NXLpY) compared with the IRS-1 PTB domain (NPXpY). Therefore, the Dok PTB domain may associatein vivo with a set of tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins distinct from that bound by IRS-1. We have shown that the PTB domain recognizes specific tyrosine-phosphorylated sequences and is required for the inhibitory activity of Dok. It is likely that Dok may exert its inhibitory function by binding to specific phosphoproteins through the PTB domain. To further investigate the phosphoproteins that might associate with the PTB domain and the mechanism by which the PTB domain might regulate Dok function, the GST-DokN fusion protein containing both PH and PTB domains was used to precipitate proteins from Src-transformed cells. As shown in Fig.4 A, multiple tyrosine-phosphorylated bands were specifically copurified with the Dok amino-terminal domain, including major proteins at ∼60 kDa, which is similar to the molecular mass of Dok. We therefore speculated that some of these proteins might be Dok family members. To test this idea, GST-DokN fusion proteins were incubated with cell lysates from Src-transformed cells that also expressed various Dok mutants. Although GST alone did not precipitate any Dok molecules, GST-DokN bound specifically to HA-tagged, wild-type Dok and various mutant Dok proteins (Fig. 4 B). The carboxyl-terminal tail of Dok is not required for this interaction, because Dok277 appeared to bind GST-DokN with the same efficiency as wild-type Dok. In addition, the GST-PTB domain alone was able to associate with HA-tagged Dok277, indicating that the PTB domain may mediate homotypic interactions of Dok (Fig.4 C). On the basis of our combinatorial peptide library mapping of the consensus substrate motif (Y/MXXNXLpY) of the Dok PTB domain, sequences surrounding residue Tyr146(LEMLENSLYS) on Dok constitute a perfect binding site for the Dok PTB domain when this tyrosine is phosphorylated. Tyr146, located between the Dok PH and PTB domains, is also a potential tyrosine phosphorylation site for the Src family PTKs (24Songyang Z. Carraway K.L. Eck M.J. Harrison S.C. Feldman R.A. Mohammadi M. Schlessinger J. Hubbard S.R. Smith D.P. Eng C. et al.Nature. 1995; 373: 536-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (844) Google Scholar). We hypothesized that Tyr146 might be necessary for the homotypic interactions mediated by the Dok PTB domain. Consistent with our hypothesis, the HA-tagged Dok mutant with its Tyr146mutated to Phe (Dok313-Y146F) failed to copurify with the GST-PTB domain, even though the GST-PTB domain fusion proteins were able to pull down the Dok amino-terminal region (Fig. 4 C). These data strongly indicate a PTB domain-mediated, direct interaction between Dok molecules. PTB domains have been shown to mediate both phosphotyrosinedependent and -independent interactions. To confirm that Dok-Dok interactions through the PTB domain were direct and tyrosine phosphorylation-dependent, we generated the His-tagged Dok amino-terminal domain (His-DokN) and His-DokN with the Y146F mutation (His-DokN-Y146F) in E. coli. These fusion proteins were in vitro-phosphorylated using recombinant c-Src and incubated with GST-Dok PTB. As shown in Fig. 4 D, only His-DokN was able to bind GST-Dok PTB, although His-DokN and His-DokN-Y146F were equally phosphorylated by c-Src. In addition, the GST-PTB domain failed to bind His-DokN in the absence of c-Src. These data demonstrate that the Dok PTB domain mediates phosphotyrosine-dependent homotypic interactions through residue Tyr146. We showed that Dok363 was the shortest mutant to still retain the inhibitory activity (Fig. 1). To determine the role of Tyr146 on Dok function, Dok363 with the Tyr146to Phe mutation (Dok363-Y146F) was generated and compared with Dok363 for its effect on Src-induced transformation in NIH3T3 cells. Notably, the Y146F mutation significantly reduced the inhibitory activity of Dok363 (Fig. 5). Therefore, mutations (in either the PTB domain or Tyr146) that prevent Dok oligomerization also abrogated its inhibitory activity. These results indicate that the homotypic interaction through Tyr146 and the Dok PTB domain is necessary for Dok function. Src is known to activate the Ras pathway, and Dok is a rasGAP-binding protein. We therefore reasoned that Dok might inhibit Src transformation by recruiting rasGAP, thereby regulating Ras activity in the cell. V12Ras (activated Ras) is locked in the GTP-bound state and therefore should be unaffected by rasGAP activity (25Khosravi-Far R. Campbell S. Rossman K.L. Der C.J. Adv. Cancer Res. 1998; 72: 57-107Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We first tested how Dok might affect V12Ras-mediated transformation in NIH3T3 cells. Consistent with its rasGAP binding ability, Dok expression did not affect focus formation induced by activated V12-K-Ras (Fig.6 A), suggesting that Dok likely acts upstream of Ras to block Ras activation. We postulated that Dok might function by increasing the local concentration of rasGAP. To test this hypothesis, anti-HA immunoprecipitates from Src-transformed cells that also expressed full-length HA-tagged Dok, Dok363, Dok336, Dok277, or Dok-AA were probed with anti-rasGAP antibodies (Fig. 6 B). Full-length Dok and Dok363 were able to associate with rasGAP; however, Dok336, Dok277, and the PTB domain mutant Dok-AA were impaired in their abilities to bind rasGAP. The inability to bind rasGAP may explain the failure of Dok336, Dok277, and Dok-AA to inhibit Src transformation (Fig. 1 B). These results further imply that the PTB domain together with the carboxyl-terminal region of Dok may function in clustering and recruiting rasGAP to the site of action. We further speculated that the recruitment of rasGap by Dok may lead to inhibition of Ras GTP loading. Consistent with this idea, the amount of Ras GTP (active Ras) was found to be significantly reduced in Src-transformed cells coexpressing Dok compared with Src-transformed cells (Fig.6 C). We have shown that expression of Dok can block c-Src-induced transformation in NIH3T3 fibroblasts, indicating that Dok may negatively regulate signal pathways that are activated by PTKs. It is possible that Dok functions to recruit negative regulators of PTK cascades. For example, Csk family kinases are known to down-regulate c-Src activity by phosphorylating Tyr527 on c-Src (26Okada M. Nada S. Yamanashi Y. Yamamoto T. Nakagawa H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 24249-24252Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 27Chow L.M. Veillette A. Semin. Immunol. 1995; 7: 207-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Furthermore, Dok family proteins have been reported to associate directly with Csk (18Lemay S. Davidson D. Latour S. Veillette A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 2743-2754Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 28Darby C. Geahlen R.L. Schreiber A.D. J. Immunol. 1994; 152: 5429-5437PubMed Google Scholar, 29Neet K. Hunter T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4908-4920Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). These data suggest that Dok may attenuate Src signaling by regulating Csk. However, this model was ruled out because Dok also inhibits transformation by activated Src (527F). Alternatively, Dok may exert its inhibitory effects via the GTPase-activating protein rasGAP. Several lines of evidence support this hypothesis. First, Dok is a rasGAP-binding protein. Association of Dok with rasGAP can be readily detected during activation of PTKs such as Src, Abl, and the Eph receptor kinase (1Ellis C. Liu X.Q. Anderson D. Abraham N. Veillette A. Pawson T. Oncogene. 1991; 6: 895-901PubMed Google Scholar, 2Koch C.A. Moran M.F. Anderson D. Liu X.Q. Mbamalu G. Pawson T. Mol. Cell.

Pawson T. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3877-3888Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). Among the seven potential tyrosine phosphorylation sites of Dok, five are predicted docking sites for the Src homology 2 domains of rasGAP (4Yamanashi Y. Baltimore D. Cell. 1997; 88: 205-211Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar, 5Holland S.J. Gale N.W. Gish G.D. Roth R.A. Songyang Z. Cantley L.C. Henkemeyer M. Yancopoulos G.D. Pawson T. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3877-3888Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). The presence of multiple rasGAP binding sites on Dok suggests that Dok may provide the molecular platform necessary for high local rasGAP activity. In addition, the Ras pathway is activated by Src and required for Src transformation of fibroblast cells (30Nori M. Vogel U.S. Gibbs J.B. Weber M.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 2812-2818Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 31DeClue J.E. Zhang K. Redford P. Vass W.C. Lowy D.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 2819-2825Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Dok may block Src transforming activity by interfering with Ras GTP loading and mitogen-activated protein kinase activation. Consistent with this model, we showed that Dok reduced Ras GTP loading and did not affect cellular transformation triggered by V12Ras, which is resistant to rasGAP activity. Furthermore, in correlation with their inability to inhibit Src-mediated transformation, Dok336, Dok277, and Dok-AA mutants failed to associate with rasGAP in Src527F-transformed cells. These observations suggest that one major function of Dok is to cluster rasGAP and thereby negatively regulate the Ras signal pathways. Increased PTK activity can result in hyperphosphorylation of Dok. In turn, more negative regulators such as rasGAP are recruited to the site of PTK activation to prevent Ras activation. Consistent with this model, it was demonstrated that Dok inhibits Ras activity in 293 cells (32Yoshida K. Yamashita Y. Miyazato A. Ohya K. Kitanaka A. Ikeda U. Shimada K. Yamanaka T. Ozawa K. Mano H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24945-24952Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). However, this model may not be universal, because Dok could inhibit rather than enhance rasGAP activity in some cells (33Kashige N. Carpino N. Kobayashi R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 2093-2098Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). One potential target of Dok is the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway. We have shown recently that mitogen-activated protein kinase activity is up-regulated in B lymphocytes from Dok−/− mice (34Yamanashi Y. Tamura T. Kanamori T. Yamane H. Nariuchi H. Yamamoto T. Baltimore D. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 11-16PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, Dok is required to mediate the inhibitory effect of FcγRIIB on Erk activation (35Tamir I. Stolpa J.C. Helgason C.D. Nakamura K. Bruhns P. Daeron M. Cambier J.C. Immunity. 2000; 12: 347-358Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). Furthermore, recent evidence has indicated that the Dok homologues Dok-R and Dok-L inhibit mitogen-activated protein kinase activation induced by the epidermal growth factor receptor and v-Abl (17Cong F. Yuan B. Goff S.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 8314-8325Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 36Jones N. Dumont D.J. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 1057-1060Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Our results have indicated that there are at least two independent functional domains in Dok, the carboxyl-terminal tail and the amino-terminal PH and PTB domains. We have shown that the carboxyl-terminal tail of Dok is necessary for Dok in vivoactivity. Dok relies on its carboxyl-terminal tail to recruit Src homology 2-containing molecules such rasGAP and Nck (5Holland S.J. Gale N.W. Gish G.D. Roth R.A. Songyang Z. Cantley L.C. Henkemeyer M. Yancopoulos G.D. Pawson T. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3877-3888Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar, 12Songyang Z. Shoelson S.E. Chaudhuri M. Gish G. Pawson T. Haser W.G. King F. Roberts T.

Deletion of residues 278–481, which encompass the cluster of potential tyrosine phosphorylation sites, was found to impair the inhibitory ability of Dok. Deletional analysis has located a minimum region (residues 336–363) on Dok that is essential for its function. Interestingly, the sequence DPIY361DEPE within this region is conserved among the Dok family proteins. Furthermore, Tyr361 is also the major docking site for Nck and rasGAP (4Yamanashi Y. Baltimore D. Cell. 1997; 88: 205-211Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar, 13Noguchi T. Matozaki T. Inagaki K. Tsuda M. Fukunaga K. Kitamura Y. Kitamura T. Shii K. Yamanashi Y. Kasuga M. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1748-1760Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). A recent study has demonstrated that Tyr361 plays a central role in Dok-mediated cell migration on insulin stimulation (13Noguchi T. Matozaki T. Inagaki K. Tsuda M. Fukunaga K. Kitamura Y. Kitamura T. Shii K. Yamanashi Y. Kasuga M. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1748-1760Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). It is therefore possible that Tyr361 is important for the inhibitory activity of Dok. How does the amino-terminal domain of Dok modulate Dok activities? The PTB and PH domains of Dok-R were shown to be necessary for Dok-R phosphorylation by the epidermal growth factor receptor (36Jones N. Dumont D.J. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 1057-1060Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Therefore, the amino-terminal PH and PTB domains may be important for efficient phosphorylation by protein-tyrosine kinases. In addition, phosphorylated Dok-AA proteins had significantly decreased binding with endogenous rasGAP, suggesting that an intact PTB domain may be required to phosphorylate the rasGAP binding sites on Dok or to recruit Dok to where rasGAP is localized. Importantly, the amino-terminal region of Dok may be needed for oligomerization of Dok and may recruit other signaling proteins. Our data on the Dok PTB domain and Tyr146 support this model. We have shown that the Dok PTB domain is capable of binding to phosphotyrosine-containing sequences. Such binding is required for Dok function, because the Dok PTB domain mutant that failed to bind phosphopeptides also lost its ability to inhibit Src-mediated transformation. Furthermore, we have demonstrated that the PTB domain also mediates Dok oligomerization by binding to the phosphorylated Tyr146 site (located between the PH and PTB domains). The Dok homotypic interaction may cluster Dok molecules at sites of PTK activation. Consistent with the importance of oligomerization, the Y146F mutation significantly decreased Dok inhibitory activity. Alternatively, the Dok PTB domain may bind negative regulators such as phosphatase SHIP1 (23Dunant N.M. Wisniewski D. Strife A. Clarkson B. Resh M.D. Cell Signal. 2000; 12: 317-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Therefore, the Dok amino-terminal domain may not only facilitate tyrosine phosphorylation of Dok but also cluster Dok and its associated proteins at the location for negative signaling. We thank Drs.

https://openalex.org/W2029224565,"Certain strains of Escherichia coliand Salmonella contain lipopolysaccharide (LPS) modified with a phosphoethanolamine (pEtN) group at position 7 of the outer 3-deoxy-d-manno-octulosonic acid (Kdo) residue. Using the heptose-deficient E. coli mutant WBB06 (Brabetz, W., Muller-Loennies, S., Holst, O., and Brade, H. (1997) Eur. J. Biochem. 247, 716–724), we now demonstrate that the critical parameter determining the presence or absence of pEtN is the concentration of CaCl2 in the medium.

(eds) (1999) Endotoxin in Health and Disease, Marcel Dekker, Inc., New YorkGoogle Scholar). LPS consists of three covalently linked domains. These are: 1) the lipid A moiety, a glucosamine-based phospholipid that serves as the hydrophobic membrane anchor of LPS; 2) the core region, a nonrepeating oligosaccharide decorated with several phosphate-containing substituents; and 3) the O-antigen, a distal repeating oligosaccharide (Fig. 1). The lipid A and the 3-deoxy-d-manno-octulosonic acid (Kdo) portions of the LPS core are essential for the growth of Escherichia coli and most other Gram-negative bacteria (1Raetz C.R.H. Annu. Rev.

Mutants lacking LPS sugars distal to Kdo are usually viable, but often show reduced virulence and sensitivity to killing by serum (5Brade, H., Opal, S. M., Vogel, S. N., and Morrison, D. C. (eds) (1999) Endotoxin in Health and Disease, Marcel Dekker, Inc., New YorkGoogle Scholar). The inner core of E. coli K-12 LPS consists of two Kdo residues and two (or three)l-glycero-d-manno-heptose moieties (Fig. 1) (2Raetz C.R.H. Neidhardt F.C.

The latter are usually derivatized with phosphate and ethanolamine pyrophosphate groups (Fig. 1) (5Brade, H., Opal, S. M., Vogel, S. N., and Morrison, D. C. (eds) (1999) Endotoxin in Health and Disease, Marcel Dekker, Inc., New YorkGoogle Scholar). Mutations in the biosynthesis or incorporation of heptose, including ones that eliminate the phosphate-containing substituents, reduce the stability of the outer membrane (2Raetz C.R.H.

The resulting “deep rough” phenotype includes hypersensitivity to certain antibiotics, decreased levels of outer membrane proteins, and resistance to bacteriophages that utilize LPS core sugars as receptors (2Raetz C.R.H.

Chem. 1998; 273: 26310-26316Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Recently, Brabetz and co-workers (9Brabetz W. Muller-Loennies S. Holst O. Brade H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 247: 716-724Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) constructed an E. colideletion mutant (WBB06) that lack both heptosyltransferase I (WaaC/RfaC) and heptosyltransferase II (WaaF/RfaF), resulting in the production of a truncated LPS missing all sugars distal to Kdo (Fig.1). Intriguingly, the authors noted that deletion of both heptosyltransferases was associated with the formation of an unusual LPS structural variant in WBB06 (Fig. 1), characterized by a high degree of pEtN substitution at position 7 of the outer Kdo residue (9Brabetz W. Muller-Loennies S. Holst O. Brade H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 247: 716-724Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Modification of Kdo with pEtN had not been observed in earlier studies of similarly truncated LPS molecules (10Qureshi N. Takayama K. Mascagni P. Honovich J. Wong R. Cotter R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263 (1976) (1): 11971Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), isolated from heptosyltransferase-deficient point mutants of E. coli. We therefore re-examined the structure of intact LPS from WBB06, using newer purification and MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry methods (11Zhou Z. Lin S. Cotter R.J. Raetz C.R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18503-18514Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). We found no evidence for a pEtN substituent on this LPS when the cells were grown in standard LB broth (12Miller J.R. Experiments in Molecular Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1972Google Scholar). However, supplementation of the medium with high concentrations of CaCl2 (5–50 mm) resulted in the appearance of a Kdo-linked pEtN moiety, as reported by Brabetz et al. (9Brabetz W. Muller-Loennies S. Holst O. Brade H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 247: 716-724Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar), who had routinely included 5 mm CaCl2 in their media to increase the growth rate of WBB06. We have now discovered a novel CaCl2-induced enzyme that modifies the outer Kdo moiety of E. coli LPS with a pEtN group. We have developed an assay for this enzyme using membranes from cells grown in the presence of 5–50 mm CaCl2. The LPS precursor, Kdo2-[4′-32P]lipid IVA (13Brozek K.A. Hosaka K. Robertson A.D. Raetz C.R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 6956-6966Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), functions as an acceptor of the pEtN moiety in our in vitro system (Fig. 2). The conditions that induce the pEtN transferase share some similarities with the treatments that make E. coli cells competent for DNA-mediated transformation (14Bergmans H.E. van Die I.M. Hoekstra W.P. J. Bacteriol. 1981; 146: 564-570Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15Ausubel, F. M., Brent, R., Kingston, R. E., Moore, D. D., Seidman, J. G., Smith, J. A., and Struhl, K. (eds) (1989) Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, John Wiley & Sons, New YorkGoogle Scholar). The mechanism of pEtN transferase induction by CaCl2 may provide new insights into the functions of the LPS core. We are not aware of any previous reports of CaCl2-induced enzymes in E. coli. [γ-32P]ATP was purchased from Perkin Elmer Life Science. Kdo, Hepes, CaCl2, and phospholipids were obtained from Sigma. Triton X-100 was purchased from Pierce. Yeast extract and tryptone were obtained from Difco. The Silica Gel 60 thin layer chromatography plates were from Merck. Pyridine, chloroform, and methanol were of reagent grade and were purchased from VWR. The E. coli deep rough mutant strain WBB06, harboring a deletion that removes portions of both the waaC and waaF genes, was kindly provided by Dr. Werner Brabetz (9Brabetz W. Muller-Loennies S. Holst O. Brade H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 247: 716-724Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). E. colistrains W3110 and W3899 were obtained from the E. coliGenetic Stock Center, Yale University. Strains were generally grown in LB broth (10 g of NaCl, 10 g of tryptone, and 5 g of yeast extract per liter) (12Miller J.R. Experiments in Molecular Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1972Google Scholar). When necessary, the cultures were supplemented with tetracycline (12 μg/ml). In some experiments, CaCl2was added to the medium at final concentrations ranging from 5 μm to 50 mm, as indicated. E. colistrain AD90 was obtained from Dr. William Dowhan at the University of Texas, Houston (16DeChavigny A. Heacock P.N. Dowhan W. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 5323-5332Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). AD90 harbors an insertion mutation in the pss gene, but is able to grow without the pss + covering plasmid when 20–50 mmMgCl2 or CaCl2 is added to the medium. Under these conditions, the membranes of AD90 lack detectable phosphatidylethanolamine. Typically, cell-free extracts were prepared by growing a 100-ml LB broth culture, supplemented with or without various divalent cations, at 37 °C to A600 = 1.7. Cells were harvested by centrifugation at 4,000 × g for 10 min. Cells were resuspended in 4 ml of 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, and broken by a single passage through a French pressure cell at 18,000 psi. Cellular debris was removed by centrifugation at 4000 × g for 15 min. Membranes were prepared by ultracentrifugation at 100,000 × g for 60 min. The membranes were resuspended in 8 ml of Hepes, pH 7.5, and the ultracentrifugation was repeated a second time at 100,000 × g to remove any contaminating cytosol. The final membrane pellet was resuspended in 1 ml 50 mmHepes, pH 7.5, and stored at −80 °C until further use. Protein concentrations were determined by the bicinchoninic acid method (Pierce) (17Smith P.K. Krohn R.I. Hermanson G.T. Mallia A.K. Gartner F.H. Provenzano M.D. Fujimoto E.K. Goeke N.M. Olson B.J. Klenk D.C. Anal. Biochem. 1985; 150: 76-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (18514) Google Scholar). The calcium-induced phosphoethanolamine transferase was assayed in cell-free extracts or membrane preparations using the LPS precursor, Kdo2-[4′-32P]lipid IVA, which was prepared enzymatically and purified as described previously (13Brozek K.A. Hosaka K. Robertson A.D. Raetz C.R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 6956-6966Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Basu S.S. York J.D. Raetz C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11139-11149Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The radiolabeled substrate was stored at −20 °C as a frozen aqueous dispersion at ∼60,000 cpm/μl in 10 mm Tris HCl, pH 7.9, with 1 mm EDTA and 1 mm EGTA. Prior to each use, the radiolabeled substrate was subjected to ultrasonic irradiation in a water bath sonicator for 1 min. The pEtN transferase was assayed in a reaction mixture (10 μl final volume) containing 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 0.1% Triton X-100, 1.25 mm dithiothreitol, and 2.5 μmKdo2-[4′-32P]lipid IVA(∼250,000 cpm/nmol). The reactions were started by addition of enzyme, and were incubated for the indicated time periods at 30 °C. The reactions were stopped by application of 4-μl samples directly onto a silica gel TLC plate. After drying at room temperature, the plate was developed in the solvent chloroform, pyridine, 88% formic acid, water (30:70:16:10, v/v). After drying, the plate was analyzed and the percent conversion to product quantified using a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager (STORM 840), equipped with ImageQuant software. Two 10-μl reaction tubes were prepared containing 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 0.1% Triton X-100, 2.5 μmKdo2-[4′-32P]lipid IVA (8,000 cpm/tube) or 2.5 μmpEtN-Kdo2-[4′-32P]lipid IVA(8,000 cpm/tube). The pEtN-Kdo2-[4′-32P]lipid IVA sample was generated using the standard pEtN transferase assay conditions, described above, and was purified by thin layer chromatography, as reported for the substrate Kdo2-[4′-32P]lipid IVA (13Brozek K.A. Hosaka K. Robertson A.D. Raetz C.R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 6956-6966Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Basu S.S. York J.D. Raetz C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11139-11149Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Next, 4 μl of 10% SDS and 26 μl of 50 mm sodium acetate, pH 4.5, were added to each tube. The tubes were then incubated in a boiling water bath. At various times, 4-μl samples were withdrawn and spotted onto a silica TLC plate. The plate was developed in the solvent chloroform, pyridine, 88% formic acid, water (30:70:16:10, v/v), and analyzed with a PhosphorImager, as described above for the assay. To determine what fraction of the LPS molecules in WBB06 are covalently modified with pEtN, 100 ml of LB broth cultures of WBB06 were grown in the presence or absence of 5 mmCaCl2 to A600 = 1.7. Cells were harvested by centrifugation at 4,000 × g for 10 min and washed once with 40 ml of phosphate-buffered saline (19Dulbecco R. Vogt M. J. Exp. Med. 1954; 99: 167-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (1993) Google Scholar). The final cell pellets were resuspended in 40 ml of phosphate-buffered saline. Glycerophospholipids and LPS were extracted for 1 h at room temperature with a single phase Bligh/Dyer mixture (20Bligh E.G. Dyer J.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-918Crossref PubMed Scopus (42411) Google Scholar), generated by adding 100 ml of methanol and 50 ml of chloroform to the cell suspension. This method is applicable to truncated “Re” LPS (2Raetz C.R.H. Neidhardt F.C. Escherichia coli and Salmonella: Cellular and Molecular Biology. 1. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1996: 1035-1063Google Scholar) made by mutants defective in heptose biosynthesis, which is soluble in this mixture, but not to more extensively glycosylated LPS molecules. The precipitated proteins and nucleic acids were removed by centrifugation at 4,000 × g for 15 min. The supernatant was converted to a two-phase Bligh/Dyer system, which consists of chloroform/methanol/water (2:2:1.8, v/v), by adding appropriate volumes of chloroform and water. The phases were separated by centrifugation at 4,000 × g for 15 min. The lower phase was dried by rotary evaporation, re-dissolved in 5 ml of chloroform/methanol/water (2:3:1, v/v), and applied to a 1-ml DEAE cellulose column (acetate form) equilibrated with the same solvent mixture (11Zhou Z. Lin S. Cotter R.J. Raetz C.R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18503-18514Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar, 21Raetz C.R.H. Kennedy E.P. J. Biol.

Chem. 1985; 260: 16080-16088Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Following sample loading, the column was washed with 10 column volumes of chloroform/methanol/water (2:3:1, v/v). The bound phospholipids and LPS were eluted with 5-ml steps of chloroform/methanol/aqueous ammonium acetate (2:3:1, v/v), with ammonium acetate concentrations of 60, 120, 240, and 480 mmsuccessively in the aqueous component. For each step elution, 1-ml fractions were collected. The appearance of the phospholipids and the LPS was determined by spotting 10-μl portions of each fraction onto a silica TLC plate. The plate was developed in the solvent chloroform, pyridine, 88% formic acid, water (30:70:16:10, v/v). After drying, the substances were visualized by spraying the plate with 10% sulfuric acid in ethanol and charring on a hot plate. The Re LPS emerged at the very end of the chloroform, methanol, 240 mm aqueous ammonium acetate wash and at the beginning of the chloroform, methanol, 480 mm aqueous ammonium acetate step. All fractions containing LPS were pooled and converted to a two-phase Bligh/Dyer mixture by addition of appropriate amounts of chloroform and water. The lower phase was dried under a stream of N2 and stored at −20 °C. Spectra were acquired in either the positive-ion or the negative-ion mode on a Kratos Analytical (Manchester, United Kingdom) time of flight matrix-assisted laser desorption-ionization (MALDI) mass spectrometer, equipped with a 337-nm nitrogen laser, a 20 kV extraction voltage, and time-delayed extraction (11Zhou Z. Lin S. Cotter R.J. Raetz C.R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18503-18514Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Each spectrum was the average of 50 shots. The matrix was a mixture of saturated 6-aza-2-thiothymine in 50% aqueous acetonitrile and 10% tribasic ammonium citrate (9:1, v/v) for the negative mode. WBB06 LPS samples were first dissolved in a mixture of chloroform/methanol (4:1, v/v) before being mixed with the matrix (1:1, v/v) on a slide (0.6 μl final volume). The sample/matrix mixture was allowed to dry at room temperature prior to mass analysis. Hexa-acylated lipid A 1,4′-bis-phosphate from E. coli, used to calibrate the spectrometer, was purchased from Sigma. Re LPS from WBB06, a heptose-deficient E. colimutant with a deletion that inactivates the adjacent waaC(rfaC) and the waaF(rfaF) genes, was previously reported to contain a pEtN substituent attached to its outer Kdo residue (9Brabetz W. Muller-Loennies S. Holst O. Brade H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 247: 716-724Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). However, in our initial experiments, MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry of LPS isolated from WBB06 cells grown on LB broth did not detect any pEtN-containing species (Fig. 3,panel A). The negative mode spectrum showed major ions at m/z 2317.2, 2237.8, 1876.2, and 1796.8 atomic mass units. The signal at m/z 2317.2 can be attributed to [M-H]− of a hexa-acylated (Kdo)2-lipid A variant with a 1-pyrophosphate substituent (Fig. 3, panel A,inset) (11Zhou Z. Lin S. Cotter R.J. Raetz C.R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18503-18514Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar, 23Strain S.M. Fesik S.W. Armitage I.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 13466-13477Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The signal at m/z 2237.8 atomic mass units is interpreted as [M-H]− of the predominant hexa-acylated (Kdo)2-lipid A 1,4′-bis-phosphate molecule (Fig. 3, panel A), characteristic of E. coli K-12. The peak at m/z 1876.2 atomic mass units could arise by loss of the Kdo disaccharide during mass spectrometry from the 1-pyrophosphate variant, while the peak at m/z1796.8 atomic mass units is explained by loss of the Kdo disaccharide from the 1,4′-bis-phosphate species. There is no evidence for peaks indicative of LPS molecules derivatized with an additional pEtN moiety on their outer Kdo moiety (or elsewhere), as would be expected around 2360 or 2440 atomic mass units for the bis-phosphate and the 1-pyrophosphate variant, respectively. The absence of a molecular species with a pEtN substituent in the spectrum of Fig. 3,panel A, was explained by the unanticipated effect of CaCl2 on the structure of E. coli LPS. Brabetz et al. (9Brabetz W. Muller-Loennies S. Holst O. Brade H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 247: 716-724Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) had noted that the growth rate of WBB06 was increased to that of wild type E. coli by the inclusion of 5 mm CaCl2 in the medium. Therefore, their experiments were carried out with LPS isolated from calcium-supplemented cells. When we grew WBB06 in LB broth in the presence of 5 mm added CaCl2, MALDI-TOF analyses revealed that a pEtN unit was indeed present in about half of the LPS molecules (Fig. 3, panel B). The proposed structure of this pEtN-(Kdo)2-lipid A 1,4′-bis-phosphate species is shown in Fig. 3 B, inset. The negative mode spectrum showed major ions at m/z 2359.6, 2237.3, and 1797.4 atomic mass units. The peaks at m/z 2359.6 and 2237.3 atomic mass units are attributed to [M-H]− of pEtN-(Kdo)2-lipid A and (Kdo)2-lipid A, respectively, both in the form of the 1,4′-bis–phosphate species (Fig. 3, panel B). (The 1-pyrophosphate variant of lipid A seen in Fig. 3, panel A, is apparently suppressed by the inclusion of 5 mm CaCl2 in the growth medium.) The peak at m/z 1797.4 could arise during mass spectrometry by cleavage of the inner Kdo-lipid A linkage of either the m/z 2359.6 or the m/z 2237.3 species. Whether the pEtN is attached to the outer or the inner Kdo residue cannot be determined from the results shown in Fig. 3. However, the spectra demonstrate unequivocally that the addition of the pEtN moiety to the Kdo region of Re LPS is absolutely dependent upon the presence of CaCl2 in the growth medium. Addition of the pEtN substituent to the lipid A moiety is excluded by the absence of a significant peak at m/z 1920 atomic mass units (Fig. 3,panel B) (11Zhou Z. Lin S. Cotter R.J. Raetz C.R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18503-18514Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Almost all of the minor peaks in Fig. 3 (not labeled) are explained by the presence of a small amounts of penta-acylated lipid A species in this particular LPS preparation (i.e. missing the myristoyl chain that is incorporated by MsbB) (24Somerville Jr., J.E.

Washed membranes, obtained from WBB06 or wild-type W3110 grown with or without 5 mm CaCl2, were assayed for pEtN transferase using Kdo2-[4′-32P]lipid IVA as the acceptor substrate. The addition of a pEtN unit to Kdo2-[4′-32P]lipid IVA generates a more hydrophilic lipid product that migrates slower than Kdo2-[4′-32P]lipid IVA. As shown in Fig.4, membranes of E. coliW3110 and WBB06 that had been grown in 5 mmCaCl2 (lanes 3 and 4) supported the conversion of Kdo2-[4′-32P]lipid IVA to a new polar product with the expected Rf. However, membranes from the same strains grown in the absence of added CaCl2 did not (Fig. 4, lanes 1 and 2). All subsequent enzymatic experiments were done using membranes from strain WBB06 grown in the presence of CaCl2,since membranes of this strain displayed somewhat higher pEtN transferase activity than membranes of W3110 (Fig. 4, lanes 4 and 3, respectively). A quantitative assay was developed for the calcium-induced pEtN transferase using Kdo2-[4′-32P]lipid IVA as substrate (Fig. 2). As expected for an enzyme that modifies the Kdo region, [4′-32P]lipid IVAdoes not serve as a substrate (not shown). The reaction has a pH optimum around 7.5 and is dependent upon the presence of the non-ionic detergent Triton X-100 (0.05–0.1%). Dithiothreitol (1.25 mm) is slightly stimulatory (not shown). EDTA added to the assay at 1 mm is strongly inhibitory (not shown), but this inhibition is reversed by inclusion of 1–2 mmMgCl2 or CaCl2. In the absence of added EDTA, however, supplementation of the assay mixture with 1–10 mmMgCl2 or CaCl2 is not stimulatory (not shown), suggesting that relatively low concentrations of these divalent cations are sufficient. The final optimized reaction mixture consisted of 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 0.1% Triton X-100, 1.25 mmdithiothreitol, and 2.5 μmKdo2-[4′-32P]lipid IVA. Product formation was proportional to time and protein concentration (Fig.5, panels A and B). The calculated specific activity of the pEtN transferase in WBB06 membranes assayed at 1.25 mg/ml was about 8 pmol/min/mg. No activity was present in a membrane-free high-speed supernatant. E. coli mutant WBB06 was grown on LB broth in the presence of supplemental concentrations of CaCl2 ranging from 5 μm to 50 mm. Transferase activity was the highest when the membranes were obtained from cells grown in 50 mmCaCl2 (Fig. 6, lane 7). No activity was observed in membranes from cells grown with 0.5 mm supplemental CaCl2 or less (Fig. 6). WBB06 was also grown in the presence of other divalent cations to determine whether or not the induction effect is specific for calcium. Membranes were isolated from WBB06 cells grown with supplemental 5 mm MgCl2, BaCl2, or ZnCl2, and were assayed for transferase activity. None of these alternative divalent cations could substitute for CaCl2 (Fig. 7).Figure 7No effect of divalent cations other than Ca2+ on the expression of the pEtN transferase. Washed membranes were obtained from WBB06 cells grown on LB broth in the presence of various supplemental divalent cations.

Hydrolysis at pH 4.5 under these conditions cleaves only those glycosidic linkages involving the anomeric carbons of Kdo, thereby randomly splitting off the outer and the inner Kdo moieties of pEtN-Kdo2-[4′-32P]lipid IVA at comparable rates (26Caroff M. Tacken A. Szabó L. Carbohydr. Res. 1988; 175: 273-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar, 27Kadrmas J.L. Raetz C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2799-2807Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Following prolonged incubation of the substrate Kdo2-[4′-32P]lipid IVA at 100 °C, [4′-32P]lipid IVA eventually emerges as the sole hydrolysis product (Fig.8, panel A), but with transient appearance of equivalent amounts of Kdo-[4′-32P]lipid IVA and [4′-32P]lipid IVA at early time points. Hydrolysis of the putative pEtN-Kdo2-[4′-32P]lipid IVA (Fig.8, panel B) shows the same time course and pattern of product formation. If the hydrophilic pEtN substituent were attached to the inner Kdo residue, a different pattern of radioactive lipids would have been observed, since release of the outer Kdo residue would have yielded an intermediate lipid species containing a single Kdo still derivatized with the pEtN moiety (27Kadrmas J.L. Raetz C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2799-2807Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The latter hydrolysis intermediate would have migrated more slowly on silica TLC than the intermediate Kdo-[4′-32P]lipid IVA (27Kadrmas J.L. Raetz C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2799-2807Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The nearly identical time courses and patterns of fragments obtained with Kdo2-[4′-32P]lipid IVA and pEtN-Kdo2-[4′-32P]lipid IVA under these hydrolysis conditions reveal that the calcium-induced pEtN transferase modifies the outer Kdo residue. E. coli cells with a null mutation in the pss gene, which encodes phosphatidylserine synthase, are unable to generate phosphatidylethanolamine (16DeChavigny A. Heacock P.N. Dowhan W. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 5323-5332Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Such mutants are able to grow slowly in the presence of 50 mmCaCl2. Membranes of the pss null mutants AD90 grown with 50 mm CaCl2 were prepared and assayed for pEtN transferase activity with Kdo2-[4′-32P]lipid IVA as the acceptor. As shown in Fig. 9 (panel A, lane 3), the absence of phosphatidylethanolamine in E. coli membranes completely abolishes transferase activity. However, membranes from the calcium-induced parental wild-type strain W3899 from which AD90 was derived (16DeChavigny A. Heacock P.N. Dowhan W. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 5323-5332Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) possess robust pEtN transferase activity (Fig. 9, panel A, lane 2). The results strongly suggest that phosphatidylethanolamine is the donor substrate for the transferase. To confirm this conclusion, various commercially available phospholipid preparations were added back to the membranes of the phosphatidylethanolamine-deficient strain AD90 in an attempt to reconstitute pEtN transferase activity. As shown in Fig. 9 A,lane 4, only phosphatidylethanolamine (1-oleoyl,2-palmitoyl) resulted in partial restoration of enzymatic activity, whereas phosphatidylglycerol and phosphatidylcholine with the same fatty acid distributions (Fig. 9 A, lanes 5 and 6) did not. Phosphatidylethanolamine isolated from E. coli was the most effective (Fig. 9 B, lane 7), although dilauroyl phosphatidylethanolamine (Fig. 9 B, lane 3) and various unsaturated phosphatidylethanolamine preparations (Fig. 9 B, lanes 8 and 9) were also very effective. Interestingly, both dipalmitoyl and distearoyl phosphatidylethanolamine were completely inactive (Fig. 9 B, lanes 5 and 6). Taken together, these findings strongly support the view that phosphatidylethanolamine is the physiologically relevant pEtN donor in our enzymatic system. Brabetz et al. (9Brabetz W. Muller-Loennies S. Holst O. Brade H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 247: 716-724Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) recently reported that the E. coli mutant WBB06, which harbors a deletion spanning the waaC(rfaC) and waaF(rfaF) genes, contains Re LPS that is decorated with a pEtN moiety at position 7 of the outer Kdo sugar. Previous investigators, using Re LPS isolated from E. coli strains harboring waaC point mutations (10Qureshi N. Takayama K. Mascagni P. Honovich J. Wong R. Cotter R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263 (1976) (1): 11971Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), had not observed this modification. We have now resolved this discrepancy by demonstrating that this particular modification of LPS with pEtN in living cells is the consequence of growth in the presence of 5–50 mm CaCl2 (Fig.3), and is unrelated to the deletion of the heptosyltransferase genes in WBB06. The earlier studies with point mutants had been carried out with cells grown in the absence of CaCl2, whereas Brabetz et al. (9Brabetz W. Muller-Loennies S. Holst O. Brade H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 247: 716-724Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) included 5 mm CaCl2 in their media to enhance the growth rate of their mutant strain. We have found for the first time conditions for assaying an E. coli enzyme that modifies the outer Kdo sugar of the LPS core with a pEtN moiety. Membranes from wild-type W3110 and mutant WBB06 grown in the presence of 5–50 mm CaCl2 (Figs. 4 and 6) both contain a novel activity that utilizes the intermediate Kdo2-[4′-32P]lipid IVA as an acceptor substrate. The enzyme is not detected in membranes from cells grown with other divalent cations (Fig. 7). We suggest that the enzyme modifies the outer Kdo sugar with pEtN (Fig. 2) based on the following lines of evidence. First, the in vitro activity that we detect in membranes from E. coli cells grown in the presence of 5–50 mm CaCl2 parallels the in vivo modification of LPS with pEtN (Figs. 3 and 4). Second, the results from the pH 4.5 hydrolysis of the pEtN-Kdo2-[4′-32P]lipid IVAproduct generated in vitro show that the modification is indeed located on the outer Kdo residue (Fig. 8). Third, the calcium-induced pEtN transferase is not seen in membranes of an E. coli pss null mutant (16DeChavigny A. Heacock P.N. Dowhan W. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 5323-5332Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which is completely deficient in the biosynthesis of phosphatidylethanolamine, strongly suggesting that phosphatidylethanolamine is the donor substrate for the pEtN moiety (Figs. 2 and 9). In fact, reconstitution of the assay system with 1 mm phosphatidylethanolamine, but not phosphatidylglycerol or phosphatidylcholine, partially restores enzymatic activity (Fig. 9). The exact location of the pEtN substituent on the outer Kdo residue of our in vitro product remains to be established. The regulatory mechanisms that high calcium concentrations induce to bring about the modification of the outer Kdo sugar with pEtN are uncertain. In some Gram-negative bacteria, the signal transduction system, PhoP/PhoQ, is activated by low concentrations of Mg2+ or Ca2+ (10 μm) (28Groisman E.A. Chiao E. Lipps C.J. Heffron F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 7077-7081Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). The PhoP/PhoQ system regulates the expression of at least 40 genes, some of which encode enzymes that modify lipid A (29Guo L. Lim K.B. Gunn J.S. Bainbridge B. Darveau R.P. Hackett M. Miller S.I. Science. 1997; 276: 250-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar). In the presence of high concentrations of Mg2+ or Ca2+ (10 mm), the PhoP/PhoQ system is shut off (30Groisman E.A. Kayser J. Soncini F.C. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 7040-7045Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar, 31Groisman E.A. BioEssays. 1998; 20: 96-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Since pEtN transferase activity is observed only when cells are grown in 5–50 mm CaCl2 (Figs. 6 and 7), expression of the enzyme is not likely to be regulated by PhoP/PhoQ, which in contrast to our system, senses both Mg2+ and Ca2+. It will be interesting to determine the regulatory mechanism by which high CaCl2 concentrations induce the pEtN transferase. We consider a transcriptional effect the most likely possibility, but we are not aware of other E. coli enzymes or proteins that are induced by high Ca2+, perhaps only because this phenomenon has received so little attention. Previous studies have shown that the inner heptose residue of E. coli LPS (Fig. 1) is modified in a constitutive manner with an ethanolamine pyrophosphate group (8Yethon J.A. Heinrichs D.E. Monteiro M.A. Perry M.B. Whitfield C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26310-26316Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 32Schnaitman C.A. Klena J.D. Microbiol. Rev. 1993; 57: 655-682Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Based on radioactive labeling studies with living cells, phosphatidylethanolamine is thought to be the precursor of the ethanolamine phosphate portion of the ethanolamine pyrophosphate moiety on heptose (33Hasin M. Kennedy E.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 12475-12477Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, in vitrosystems have not been reported for ethanolamine pyrophosphate biosynthesis. It is unlikely that our calcium-induced pEtN transferase plays a role in modification of the heptose region, since the latter is independent of calcium (5Brade, H., Opal, S. M., Vogel, S. N., and Morrison, D. C. (eds) (1999) Endotoxin in Health and Disease, Marcel Dekker, Inc., New YorkGoogle Scholar, 8Yethon J.A. Heinrichs D.E. Monteiro M.A. Perry M.B. Whitfield C. J. Biol.

Bacterial Endotoxic Lipopolysaccharides, Vol. I: Molecular Biochemistry and Cellular Biology. CRC Press, Boca Raton1992: 135-170Google Scholar). However, the pEtN transferases that modify the Kdo and heptose regions might display sequence or structural homology to each other. Unfortunately, the relevant genes encoding these enzymes are not yet known. The function of our calcium-induced pEtN transferase is uncertain. It might play a role in rendering cells competent for DNA-mediated transformation, given that the conditions used to make cells competent involve exposure to high levels of CaCl2(14Bergmans H.E. van Die I.M. Hoekstra W.P. J. Bacteriol. 1981; 146: 564-570Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15Ausubel, F. M., Brent, R., Kingston, R. E., Moore, D. D., Seidman, J. G., Smith, J. A., and Struhl, K. (eds) (1989) Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, John Wiley & Sons, New YorkGoogle Scholar), similar to what we use to induce the pEtN transferase. Alternatively, the presence of the pEtN moiety on the outer Kdo sugar might ensure resistance of the outer membrane to environmental stresses, such as exposure to certain detergents, antibiotics, or serum. The latter contains about 1 mm Ca2+, which might be sufficient to trigger induction. Future studies will be aimed at cloning the gene encoding the calcium-induced pEtN transferase, since the characterization of a null mutant should reveal the function of this unusual enzyme."

K. (1999) J. Biol. Chem. 274, 34669–34675). To identify upstream signaling molecules, we transfected human endothelial cells with dominant negative and active mutants of Ras and evaluated their effects on eNOS promoter activity. Neither mutant altered the basal or LPC-induced eNOS promoter function. By contrast, a dominant negative mutant of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase γ (PI-3Kγ) blocked the promoter activity induced by LPC. Wortmannin and LY 294002 had a similar effect. AG-490, a selective inhibitor of Janus kinase 2 (Jak2), also reduced the LPC-induced Sp1 binding and eNOS promoter activity to the basal level. LPC induced Jak2 phosphorylation, which was abolished by LY 294002 and the dominant negative mutant of PI-3Kγ. LY 294002 and AG-490 abrogated MEK-1 phosphorylation induced by LPC but had no effect on Raf-1. These results indicate that PI-3Kγ and Jak2 are essential for LPC-induced eNOS promoter activity. This signaling pathway was sensitive to pertussis toxin, suggesting the involvement of a Gi protein in PI-3Kγ activation.

That LPC is capable of up-regulating the expression of vasoprotective eNOS is intriguing, because LPC has emerged as an important mediator of vascular injury, inflammation, and atherosclerosis (7Witztum J.

Despite these reports, the signaling pathways that lead to transcriptional up-regulation of these proinflammatory and growth factor genes remain unclear. By contrast, the transcriptional regulation of eNOS is more extensively investigated. The basal eNOS promoter activity depends on binding of Sp1 to an Sp1 cognate site (−90 to −104) on the human eNOS 5′-flanking promoter region (27Zhang R. Min W. Sessa W.C. J. Biol.

In our previous study, we have shown that LPC up-regulates eNOS promoter activity by augmenting specifically the Sp1 binding activity (29Cieslik K. Zembowicz A. Tang J.-L. Wu K.K. J. Biol.

We have further shown that LPC selectively activates extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) via mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase 1 (MEK-1), and PD98059 (2′-amino-3′-methoxyflavaone), a selective inhibitor of MEK-1, abrogated the Sp1-dependent eNOS promoter up-regulation, consistent with an essential role of MEK-1 and ERK1/2 in LPC-induced promoter activity (30Cieslik K. Lee C.-M. Tang J.-L. Wu K.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34669-34675Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The signaling pathway upstream of MEK-1 has not been reported. In this study, we searched for upstream signaling kinases by using dominant negative mutants or selective pharmacological inhibitors, or both. Here, we report identification of PI-3Kγ as an essential signaling molecule in MEK-1 activation with subsequent Sp1-dependent eNOS promoter up-regulation by LPC. Our results further show that PI-3Kγ activates a downstream Janus kinase 2 (Jak2), which in turn activates MEK-1. Neither Ras nor Raf-1 activation is required for eNOS promoter activation by LPC. Two human endothelial cell lines, ECV304 and EAhy926 cells, were used in our experiments, which yielded similar results. ECV304 cells were cultured in Medium 199 (Life Technologies, Inc.) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS). EAhy926 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies) with high glucose and l-glutamine, containing 10% FBS and HAT supplement (10 μm hypoxanthine and 1.6 μm thymidine) (Life Technologies). Unless otherwise indicated, both types of cells were incubated in medium containing 0.5% FBS for 16 h before experiments. A 5′-flanking fragment of the eNOS promoter at nucleotide positions from −1322 to +22 was obtained by polymerase chain reaction, using genomic DNA as a template and synthetic oligomers as primers: EN1322G (5′-AAAGATCTTCCATCTCCCTCCTCCTG-3′) and EN3H (5′-GGGAAGCTTGTTACTGTGCGTCCACTCTG-3′). The polymerase chain reaction product purified from an agarose gel was digested with BglII-HindIII and cloned into a promoterless luciferase expression vector, pGL3. Two dominant negative PI-3K constructs, Δp85 and Δ110γ, were cloned into a promoterless vector, pCMV5, as described previously (31Ma A. Abrams C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28730-28735Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 32Ma A. Metjian A. Bagrodia S. Taylor S.A. Abrams C.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 4744-4751Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The Δp85 construct lacks amino acid residues 478–513 of the p85 subunit and functions as a dominant negative mutant for PI-3Kα, -β, and -δ. The Δ110γ construct lacks amino acids 948–981 and functions as a dominant negative mutant of PI-3Kγ. Dominant negative Ras (S17N) and dominant active Ras (Q61L) mutants and the control vector pUSEamp (+) were obtained from Upstate Biotechnology. To evaluate the effects of mutant constructs on eNOS promoter activity, cells grown in 35-mm wells at ∼50% confluence were incubated with 2 μg eNOS promoter construct at 37 °C for 30 min followed by addition of 2 μg Ras or PI-3K mutant constructs with 10 μl Lipofectin for 5 h. Medium was removed and replaced with complete medium for 24 h. Cells were washed, incubated in medium containing 0.5% FBS for 16 h, and then incubated in fresh medium containing 5% FBS in the presence or absence of 100 μm LPC for 5 h. Cells were harvested, and the promoter activity was measured. For Sp1 binding experiments, cells grown in 100-mm dishes to ∼50% confluence were treated with 16 μg of mutant constructs and 80 μl Lipofectin for 5 h. Cells were washed and incubated in complete medium for 24 h, and then the medium was removed and replaced with fresh medium containing 0.5% FBS for 15 h. Cells were again washed and incubated in fresh medium containing 5% FBS with or without 100 μm LPC for 3 h. Cells were harvested, nuclear extracts were prepared, and the gel shift assay was performed as described below. eNOS promoter activity was determined by a procedure described previously (28Tang J.-l. Zembowicz A. Xu X.-M. Wu K.K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 213: 673-680Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). In brief, cells were incubated in serum-free medium containing a mixture of 10 μl Lipofectin and 2 μg eNOS promoter-luciferase construct at 37 °C for 5 h. Medium was removed, and cells were washed and incubated with fresh complete medium for 24 h. The medium was removed and replaced with fresh medium containing 0.5% FBS. Cells were washed and incubated in fresh medium containing 5% FBS with or without the pharmacological inhibitor to be investigated for 1 h before addition of 100 μm LPC for 5 h at 37 °C. For the pertussis toxin (PTX) experiment, the medium was removed and replaced with fresh medium containing 0.5% FBS with or without PTX for 16 h. The medium was replaced with fresh medium containing 5% FBS to which 100 μm LPC was added. The cells were incubated for an additional 5 h at 37 °C. The cells were harvested, and the expressed luciferase activity was measured in a luminometer (Bioscan). The results were expressed as a relative light units/μg protein. Genistein, wortmannin, LY 294002 (2-(4-morpholinyl)-8-phenyl-4 H-1-benzopyran-4-one), AG-490 (α-cyano-(3,4-dihydroxy)-N-benzylcinnamide), and PTX were purchased from Calbiochem, and LPC was purchased from Avanti. The gel shift assay was performed as described previously (29Cieslik K. Zembowicz A. Tang J.-L. Wu K.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14885-14890Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Endothelial cells were washed and incubated for 1 h in fresh medium containing 5% FBS in the presence or absence of a pharmacological inhibitor followed by addition of LPC for 3 h. 10 μg of nuclear extracts from these treated cells were incubated in a binding buffer containing 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 50 mm KCl, 10% glycerol, 50 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 6.0 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm ZnCl2, 1.5 μg poly(dI-dC), and 0.03% Nonidet P-40 at room temperature for 15 min. A [γ32P]ATP-labeled Sp1 oligonucleotide probe (29Cieslik K. Zembowicz A. Tang J.-L. Wu K.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14885-14890Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) was added and incubated at room temperature for 15 min. The mixture was electrophoresed at 12.5 V/cm on a 5% polyacrylamide gel with a buffer containing 0.5× Tris borate-EDTA and 0.5% Nonidet P-40. The gel was vacuum dried and autoradiographed. We have previously demonstrated that nuclear extracts prepared from ECV304 or EAhy926 cells form two retarded bands with a labeled probe containing the canonical Sp1 motif (29Cieslik K. Zembowicz A. Tang J.-L. Wu K.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14885-14890Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). These two bands were competed out by a 100-fold molar excess of unlabeled probe but not by Sp1-mutated probe. Our previous experiments also demonstrated that LPC treatment invariably enhanced Sp1 binding by ∼2-fold (29Cieslik K. Zembowicz A. Tang J.-L. Wu K.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14885-14890Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), and the augmented Sp1 binding was responsible for a concordant increase in the eNOS promoter activity. These results have been highly reproducible. Only the two shifted bands of Sp1-DNA complexes are shown in the figures. The denser band was subject to densitometry in all experiments. The Jak2 activity was assayed by its autophosphorylation (33Storz P. Doppler H. Pfizenmaier K. Muller G. FEBS Lett. 1999; 464: 159-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Cells were incubated in fresh medium containing 5% FBS in the presence or absence of an inhibitor for 1 h before addition of LPC for 15 min. Cells were then washed twice with ice-cold buffered saline containing 0.5 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5 mmNa3VO4, and 0.05 m NaF and then lysed in a Triton X-100 lysis buffer containing 1% Triton X-100, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 137 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 2 mm EDTA, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0.05 m NaF for 1 h at 4 °C with mild agitation. Detergent-insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 4 °C for 15 min at 12,000 rpm. Protein concentration was determined using a bicinchoninic acid protein assay (Pierce). 500 μg of the cell lysate proteins were immunoprecipitated with an anti-Jak2 antibody (Santa Cruz) overnight in immunoprecipitation buffer containing PBS, pH 7.4, 0.5 mmEDTA, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 μg/ml leupeptin. Protein G Plus agarose (Santa Cruz) was added to absorb immune complexes, and after washing twice with immunoprecipitation buffer and once with Jak2 kinase buffer (0.02 m1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid, 3 mmMnCl2, and 1 μg/ml leupeptin), the immune complexes were resuspended in 50 μl of Jak2 kinase buffer containing 10 μCi [γ32P]ATP for 30 min at 30 °C. The reaction was stopped by addition of 2× Laemmlli buffer. Proteins were boiled for 5 min and subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and autoradiography. The Western blot analysis was performed by a procedure described previously (17Zembowicz A. Jones S.L. Wu K.K. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 1688-1692Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Cells were incubated for 1 h in medium containing 5% FBS with or without an inhibitor followed by incubation with LPC for 15 min. 20 μg of cell lysate proteins were loaded to each lane of a 10% SDS gel. Anti-MEK-1 antibodies were purchased from Upstate Biotechnology. An antibody to phosphorylated Raf-1 was obtained from New England Biolabs. An anti-Jak2 antibody was obtained from Santa Cruz, and an antibody to phosphorylated MEK-1 was from Calbiochem. An antibody to human eNOS was obtained from Transduction Laboratories. The secondary goat anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibody was obtained from Pierce. The blots were detected by an enhanced chemiluminescence system (Pierce). Results from our previous report (30Cieslik K. Lee C.-M. Tang J.-L. Wu K.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34669-34675Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) indicate that LPC selectively activates MEK-1 and ERK1/2 via which Sp1 binding activity was increased and eNOS promoter activity was augmented. To determine whether LPC-induced eNOS expression depends on activation of upstream Ras, we transfected ECV304 cells or EAhy926 cells with a Ras dominant negative mutant, a constitutively active Ras mutant, or an empty vector and determined the basal and LPC-induced eNOS promoter activity by cotransfecting the cells with the luciferase expression vectors. Basal and LPC-induced eNOS promoter activities (Fig.1 A) in cells transfected with the control vector pUSE were comparable with those in native cells as previously reported (29Cieslik K. Zembowicz A. Tang J.-L. Wu K.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14885-14890Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Neither the dominant active nor the dominant negative mutants significantly altered the basal or LPC-induced activities (Fig. 1 A). In accord with this, neither mutant had a significant effect on Sp1 binding activity (Fig. 1, Band C). It has been previously reported that transforming growth factor β1 (TGFβ1) activates the Ras→MEK-1 signaling pathway in several types of cells including endothelial cells (34Santibáñez J.F. Iglesias M. Frontelo P. Martinez J. Quintanilla M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 273: 521-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 35Yamamoto H. Atsuchi N. Tanaka H. Ogawa W. Abe M.

Counter C. Wang X.-F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35381-35387Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 37Inoue N. Venema R.C. Sayegh H.S. Ohara Y. Murphy T.J. Harrison D.G. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1995; 15: 1255-1261Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). We therefore evaluated the effect of the dominant negative mutant of Ras on TGFβ1-induced MEK-1 activation measured as phosphorylated MEK-1 on immunoblots. Our results confirmed that TGFβ1 (5 ng/ml) activated MEK-1, which was abrogated by the dominant negative mutant of Ras but not by the control vector (Fig.1, D and E). Taken together, these results indicate that the signaling pathway by which LPC induced eNOS promoter activity bypasses Ras as contrasted to the requirement of Ras for the TGFβ1 signaling in endothelial cells. To search for an upstream kinase that transmits signals to augment the eNOS promoter activity via the MEK-1/ERK1/2 pathway, we evaluated the effects of selective PI-3K inhibitors on eNOS promoter activity and Sp1 binding activity. Neither wortmannin (50 nm) nor LY 294002 (50 μm) inhibited basal Sp1 binding activity (Fig. 2, Aand B) or eNOS promoter activity (Fig. 2 C) but reduced the LPC-induced Sp1 binding activity (Fig. 2, A and B) and eNOS promoter activity (Fig. 2 C) to the basal level. Because neither wortmannin nor LY 294002 is a selective inhibitor of PI-3K isoforms, we used Δp110γ and Δp85 to identify the isoform of PI-3K that is involved in LPC-induced eNOS transcription. LPC-induced eNOS promoter activity was blocked by Δp110γ transfection but not by Δp85 transfection (Fig.3). Neither mutant reduced the basal activity, and the control vector had no effect on LPC-induced or basal promoter activity (Fig. 3). Thus, LPC-induced eNOS promoter function depends on activation of PI-3Kγ. PI-3Kγ activation has been reported to be linked to an upstream Gi activation, when Giβγ is dissociated from Giαand interacts with PI-3Kγ (38Lopez-Ilasaca M. Crespo P. Pellici G. Gutkind J.S. Wetzker R. Science. 1997; 275: 394-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (629) Google Scholar). We therefore determined whether the LPC-induced eNOS promoter function was PTX sensitive. The eNOS promoter activity induced by LPC was abrogated by PTX treatment (Fig.4 A). This was confirmed by a reduction of the Sp1 binding activity to the basal level by PTX (100 ng/ml; Fig. 4, B and C). Neither the basal eNOS promoter activity nor the basal Sp1 binding activity was perturbed by PTX. These results suggest that the action of LPC on eNOS promoter activity is mediated by PTX-sensitive, Gi-coupled activation of PI-3Kγ.Figure 3Dominant negative mutant of PI-3K γ (Δp110γ) but not Δp85 suppressed LPC-induced eNOS promoter activity.

The eNOS promoter activity was also inhibited by genistein at 50 μm (Fig.5 C). Because receptor tyrosine kinase is reported to be inhibited by genistein at a 5 μm concentration (IC50 = 2.6 μm; Ref. 39Akiyama T. Ishida J. Nakagawa S. Ogawara H. Watanabe S. Itoh N. Shibuya M. Fukami Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 5592-5597Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), whereas cytosolic tyrosine kinase is inhibited by higher genistein concentrations, our results suggest the involvement of a cytosolic tyrosine kinase in eNOS promoter activity. AG-490, a selective inhibitor of a cytosolic tyrosine kinase, Jak2, reduced the Sp1 binding to the basal level (Fig.6, A and B) with a concordant suppression of eNOS promoter activity (Fig. 6 C). LPC-induced Jak2 phosphorylation was blocked by AG-490 (50 μm; Fig. 7 A). The Jak2 level was, on the other hand, unchanged (Fig. 7 B). Interestingly, Jak2 phosphorylation was abolished by treatment with LY 294002 (50 μm) or PTX (100 ng/ml; Fig. 7 A), suggesting that Jak2 activation is downstream of PI-3Kγ activation. This was supported by the results demonstrating that Jak2 phosphorylation was abolished in cells transfected with Δp110γ but not with Δp85 (Fig. 7 C).Figure 6Suppression of Sp1 binding and eNOS promoter activity by a selective Jak2 inhibitor, AG-490 (AG; 50 μ CM;1M).

We measured the levels of phosphorylated MEK-1 and Raf-1-P, because phosphorylation of these two signaling molecules correlate with their activation. Raf-1-P was detected in unstimulated cells, which was not enhanced by LPC (Fig. 8 A). AG-490 (50 μm), LY 294002 (50 μm), and PTX (100 ng/ml) had no effect on Raf-1-P levels (Fig. 8 A). The Raf-1 protein levels were also unaffected by any of the treatments (data not shown). By contrast, the phosphorylated MEK-1 level was increased by ∼2-fold in response to LPC stimulation, and this increase was blocked by AG-490 (50 μm), as well as by LY 294002 (50 μm) and PTX (100 ng/ml; Fig. 8, Band C). The MEK-1 protein level was unaltered (Fig.8 D). These results are consistent with MEK-1 as the target of the PI-3Kγ/Jak2 signaling pathway. The results so far indicate that LPC increased Sp1-mediated eNOS promoter activity via the Gi-coupled PI-3Kγ→Jak2→MEK-1 pathway. To confirm that this pathway is involved in eNOS protein expression, we evaluated the effects of several inhibitors on eNOS protein levels. LPC increased eNOS protein over the basal level by ∼2-fold, which is in agreement with the extent of increase in eNOS promoter activity. The eNOS protein increase was reduced to the basal level by PTX, AG-490, and LY 294002 (Fig.9, A and B). Several laboratories including ours have reported that LPC activates MEK-1, which in turn activates ERK1/2 (21Wong J.T. Tran K. Pierce G.N. Chan A.C., O, K. Choy P.C. J. Biol.

A 10-amino acid residue motif within the GHR cytosolic tail (the ubiquitin-dependent endocytosis motif) is involved in both GHR ubiquitination and endocytosis. As shown previously, ubiquitination of the receptor itself is not required. In this paper ubiquitination of the GHR was used as a tool to address the question of at which stage the ubiquitin conjugation system acts in the process of GHR endocytosis. If potassium depletion was used to interfere with early stages of coated pit formation, both GHR endocytosis and ubiquitination were inhibited. Treatment of cells with methyl-β-cyclodextrin inhibited endocytosis at the stage of coated vesicle formation. Growth hormone addition to methyl-β-cyclodextrin-treated cells resulted in an accumulation of ubiquitinated GHR at the cell surface. Using immunoelectron microscopy, the GHR was localized in flattened clathrin-coated membranes. In addition, when clathrin-mediated endocytosis was inhibited in HeLa cells expressing a temperature-sensitive dynamin mutant, ubiquitinated GHR accumulated at the cell surface. Together, these data show that the GHR is ubiquitinated at the plasma membrane, before endocytosis occurs, and indicate that the resident time of the GHR at the cell surface is regulated by the ubiquitin conjugation system together with the endocytic machinery.

Recruitment of membrane proteins into clathrin-coated pits is mediated by specific amino acid sequences within their cytoplasmic domain (for review, see Refs. 1Mellman I. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1996; 12: 575-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (1336) Google Scholar, 2Schmid S.L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 511-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (673) Google Scholar). The best-defined coated pit localization signals are the tyrosine-based motifs NPX Y as described for,e.g. the low-density lipoprotein receptor (3Chen W.-J. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 3116-3123Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and YXXΦ (where Φ is an amino acid with a bulky hydrophobic group) found in, e.g. the transferrin receptor (4Collawn J.F.

Alternatively, internalization of the insulin and β2-adrenergic receptor is mediated by a dileucine-containing motif (5Haft C.R. Klausner R.D. Taylor S.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26286-26294Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Gabilondo A.M. Hegler J. Krasel C. Boivinjahns V. Hein L. Lohse M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 12285-12290Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Many receptors, including the low-density lipoprotein receptor and the transferrin receptor, are clustered in coated pits and internalized constitutively, independent of ligand occupancy. The heterotetrameric adaptor complex AP-2 binds directly to the tyrosine-based motif and nucleates assembly of clathrin triskelions onto the plasma membrane (for review, see Ref. 7Kirchhausen T. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 15: 705-732Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar). Invagination of the plasma membrane results in the formation of constricted coated pits, followed by the dynamin-dependent detachment of coated vesicles from the plasma membrane. More complex situations exist when plasma membrane proteins enter cells on stimuli such as hormone binding or specific signal transduction events. In this case the internalization signal is only recognized on ligand binding, or the stimulus induces the addition of a signal, which results in the subsequent recruitment of the receptor into the coated pit. The agonist-induced phosphorylation of the β2-adrenergic receptor resulting in the binding of β-arrestin, a specialized adaptor that binds to clathrin, is an example of a protein modification that regulates internalization (8Goodman O.B.

Recently, it was shown that the attachment of ubiquitin moieties is involved in the internalization of several plasma membrane proteins (for review, see Refs. 9Strous G.J. Govers R. J.

In mammalian cells, the ubiquitin conjugation system regulates the endocytosis of the epithelial sodium channel (11Staub O. Gautschi I. Ishikawa T. Breitschopf K. Ciechanover A. Schild L. Rotin D.

In particular, a 10-amino acid motif within the GHR cytosolic tail (the ubiquitin-dependent endocytosis motif, DSWVEFIELD) is involved in both receptor ubiquitination and endocytosis (15Govers R. ten Broeke T. van Kerkhof P. Schwartz A.L. Strous G.J. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 28-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). We have recently shown that the proteasome is also involved in GHR internalization (16van Kerkhof P. Govers R. Alves Dos Santos C.M. Strous G.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1575-1580Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Ligand-induced internalization of the GHR is blocked in the presence of specific proteasomal inhibitors such as carbobenzoxy-l-leucyl-l-leucyl-l-leucinal and β-lactone, the more membrane-permeable analogue of lactacystin. Disruption of clathrin-mediated endocytosis by cellular potassium depletion (17Larkin J.M. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Anderson R.G.W.

Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 679-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar) inhibits internalization and ubiquitination of the GHR (14Govers R. van Kerkhof P. Schwartz A.L. Strous G.J. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4851-4858Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Although ubiquitination of the GHR itself is not required for endocytosis (15Govers R. ten Broeke T. van Kerkhof P. Schwartz A.L. Strous G.J. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 28-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar), GHR internalization requires the activity of the ubiquitin conjugation system, which acts together with the endocytic machinery in targeting the receptor into the coated pit. In this study the question was addressed of at which stage the ubiquitin conjugation system acts in the process of GHR endocytosis. GHR ubiquitination was taken as a biochemical marker for the location of the activity of the ubiquitin conjugation system. Conditions in which coated pit formation was prevented were compared with conditions that allowed coated pit formation but prevented coated vesicle formation. Antibody mAb5 recognizing the lumenal part of the GHR was from AGEN Inc. (Parsippany, NJ). Polyclonal antibodies against amino acid residues 271–318 of the cytosolic tail of the GHR (Anti-T; Ref. 16van Kerkhof P. Govers R. Alves Dos Santos C.M. Strous G.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1575-1580Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar) and against human growth hormone (GH) were raised in rabbits. Antiserum specific for protein-ubiquitin conjugates was a generous gift from Dr. A. Ciechanover (Technion-Israel Institute of Technology, Haifa, Israel). Antibody 4G10 (anti-pY), recognizing phosphotyrosine residues, was obtained from Upstate Biotechnologies Inc. (Lake Placid, NY). Anti-biotin was from Rockland (Gilbertsville, PA); monoclonal anti-clathrin was from Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, NY); anti-mouse IgG was from Nordic Immunological Laboratories (Tilburg, The Netherlands); and monoclonal anti-hemagglutinin (HA) antibody 12CA5 was from Babco (Richmond, CA). Human GH was a kind gift from Lilly; methyl-β-cyclodextrin (MβCD) was from Sigma; LipofectAMINE was from Life Technologies, Inc.; and carbobenzoxy-l-leucyl-l-leucyl-l-leucinal was from Calbiochem. Wild-type rabbit GHR cDNA was cloned into the cytomegalovirus-Neo expression plasmid pcDNA3.1 (Invitrogen BV/Novex) and used for transient transfections. The internalization-deficient mutant GHR(F327A) was constructed by site-directed mutagenesis and cloned into pcDNA3.1 as described (20Strous G.J. van Kerkhof P. Govers R. Rotwein P. Schwartz A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 40-43Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The Chinese hamster cell line ts20, stably transfected with a pCB6 construct containing the rabbit GHR cDNA sequence, was used in this study (12Strous G.J. van Kerkhof P. Govers R. Ciechanover A. Schwartz A.L. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3806-3812Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). Cells were grown at 30 °C in MEMα supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 4.5 g/l glucose, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 0.45 mg/ml geneticin. For experiments cells were grown on 35- or 60-mm dishes in the absence of geneticin to ∼75% confluence, and 10 mmsodium butyrate was added overnight to increase GHR expression (12Strous G.J. van Kerkhof P. Govers R. Ciechanover A. Schwartz A.L. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3806-3812Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). tTA-HeLa cell lines stably transfected with the HA-tagged temperature-sensitive mutant of dynamin (dynTS) or wild-type dynamin (wtdyn) were kindly provided by Dr. S. Schmid (The Scripps Research Institute, La Jolla, CA). DynTS carries a mutation of the glycine at position 273 to aspartic acid. Cells were cultured at 37 °C in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 0.4 mg/ml geneticin, 2 μg/ml tetracycline, and 200 ng/ml puromycin. For transfection experiments subconfluent cultures of tTA-HeLa cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), detached with trypsin-EDTA, plated on 60-mm dishes, and incubated at the permissive temperature of 32 °C in the absence of tetracycline for 24 h. Cells were 30–40% confluent when transfected with 1 μg cDNA/dish, using LipofectAMINE according to the manufacturer's protocol. After 24 h, cells were washed with medium free of tetracycline. Cells were used for experiments 48 h after transfection and 72 h after removal of tetracycline. 125I-Human GH was prepared using chloramine T (12Strous G.J. van Kerkhof P. Govers R. Ciechanover A. Schwartz A.L. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3806-3812Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). For internalization studies, cells were grown in 12-well cluster plates, washed with MEMα supplemented with 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, and 0.1% bovine serum albumin (BSA), and incubated in a water bath. 125I-GH (8 nm) was bound on ice for 2 h, and the cells were washed free of unbound GH and incubated for 0–30 min at 30 °C. Membrane-associated GH was removed by acid wash (0.15 mNaCl, 50 mm glycine, 0.1% BSA, pH 2.5) on ice. Internalized GH was determined by measuring the radioactivity after solubilization of the acid-treated cells in 1 m NaOH using an LKB gamma counter. Cells were grown in 60-mm dishes and incubated in methionine- and cysteine-free MEM. Then 3.7 MBq/ml [35S]methionine (Tran35S Label,40 TBq/mmol; ICN, Costa Mesa, CA) was added, and the incubation was continued at 30 °C in a CO2 incubator. The radioactivity was replaced with medium containing 100 μm unlabeled methionine, 0.1% BSA, and 8 nm GH and chased for 0–60 min. Cells were lysed, and samples were immunoprecipitated (see below). Radioactivity was determined using a Storm imaging system (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA) and quantified with Molecular Dynamics Image Quant software, version 4.2a. Immunoprecipitations were performed as described previously (12Strous G.J. van Kerkhof P. Govers R. Ciechanover A. Schwartz A.L. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3806-3812Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). For GHR immunoprecipitations, cells were lysed on ice in 0.3 ml of lysis mix containing 1% Triton X-100, 1 mmEDTA, 50 mm NaF, 1 mmNa3VO4, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 μmcarbobenzoxy-l-leucyl-l-leucyl-l-leucinal, and 100 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride in PBS. In ubiquitin immunoprecipitation experiments the cells were lysed in 0.3 ml boiling lysis buffer containing 1% SDS, 1 mm EDTA, 50 mm NaF, and 1 mmNa3VO4. The lysate was heated for 5 min at 100 °C, after which the DNA was sheared using a 25-G needle. Immunoprecipitation of the supernatant was carried out in 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% SDS, 0.25% sodium deoxycholate, and 0.5% BSA in PBS plus various inhibitors. For anti-GH immunoprecipitations of GH-GHR complexes, the cells were lysed on ice in a lysis mix containing 1% Triton X-100, 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.0, 10 mm N-ethylmaleimide, and various inhibitors. The immunoprecipitation was carried out in the same buffer. The lysates were incubated with the indicated antibodies for 2 h on ice, and immune complexes were isolated using protein A-agarose beads (Repligen Co., Cambridge, MA). The immunoprecipitates were washed twice with the same buffer and twice with 10-fold diluted PBS. Immune complexes were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and immunoblotting as described (14Govers R. van Kerkhof P. Schwartz A.L. Strous G.J. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4851-4858Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). For detection the enhanced chemiluminescence system (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) was used. To reprobe blots, the membranes were incubated for 1 h at room temperature in 0.15 m NaCl, 50 mm glycine, pH 2.5, buffer. The efficiency of the stripping procedure was checked and was found to remove >95% of the signal. Cells were subjected to potassium depletion as described previously (14Govers R. van Kerkhof P. Schwartz A.L. Strous G.J. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4851-4858Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 18Hansen S.H. Sandvig K. VanDeurs B. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 61-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). All incubation steps were performed at 30 °C. Cells were washed twice with isotonic, potassium-free buffer A, (0.14 m NaCl, 20 mmHepes, 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mmMgCl2, 1 g/l glucose, and 0.1% BSA, pH 7.4) and subjected to a hypotonic shock for 5 min in buffer A diluted 1:1 with H2O. After incubation in buffer A for 30 min, GH was added for an additional 30 min. Parallel cultures, which had also been hypotonically shocked, were incubated in buffer A supplemented with 10 mm KCl. Fluorescently labeled GH (Cy3-GH) was prepared as described before (16van Kerkhof P. Govers R. Alves Dos Santos C.M. Strous G.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1575-1580Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Cells grown on coverslips were incubated in MEMα supplemented with 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, and 0.1% BSA. Cy3-GH (0, 8 μg/ml) was added, and the incubation was continued. Cells were washed with PBS to remove unbound label and fixed for 2 h in 3% paraformaldehyde in PBS. After fixation, the cells were embedded in Mowiol, and confocal laser scanning microscopy was performed using a Leica TCS 4D system. Cells were incubated in MEMα plus 0.1% BSA and 8 nm biotinylated GH (21Bentham J. Aplin R. Norman M.R. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1994; 42: 103-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar) in a CO2 incubator. Before fixation and processing for immunoelectron microscopy, cells were washed three times with MEMα and 0.1% BSA. The cells were fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde and 0.2% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 m phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, for 30 min on ice followed by 3 h at room temperature. Further processing for ultrathin cryosectioning and labeling according to the protein A-gold method was done as described previously (22Slot J.W. Geuze H.J. Gigengack S. Lienhard G.E. James D.E. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 113: 123-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (712) Google Scholar). To pick up ultrathin cryosections, a 1:1 mixture of 2.3 m sucrose and 1.8% methylcellulose was used (23Liou W. Geuze H.J. Slot J.W. Histochem. Cell Biol. 1996; 106: 41-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar). A rabbit polyclonal antibody against biotin was directly visualized by protein A-gold. A mouse monoclonal antibody against clathrin was first incubated with rabbit anti-mouse IgG, to provide binding sides for protein A, which binds poorly to mouse antibodies. The effect of MβCD on clathrin-coated pit morphology was quantified by determining the number of clathrin-coated structures at the plasma membrane. MβCD-treated and control cells were labeled for clathrin, and the plasma membrane of 50 cell profiles with visible nucleus was screened for clathrin-coated structures, which were subdivided into four categories: 1) flat or slightly invaginated coated pits, 2) invaginated coated pits with a wide opening, 3) invaginated coated pits with a constricted neck, and 4) vesicles in close vicinity to the plasma membrane, which were not connected to the plasma membrane in the plane of the section. The frequency of each category was expressed as a percentage of the total number of clathrin-coated structures at the plasma membrane. The GHR enters the cell via clathrin-coated pits (14Govers R. van Kerkhof P. Schwartz A.L. Strous G.J. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4851-4858Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 24Ilondo M.M.

Courtoy P.J. Endocrinology. 1991; 128: 1597-1602Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Previously we used methods that deplete the cytosol of free clathrin triskelions and interfere with the early stages of coated pit formation (18Hansen S.H. Sandvig K. VanDeurs B. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 61-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar, 26Brown C.M. Petersen N.O. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1999; 77: 439-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). These methods inhibited GHR internalization and abolished GHR ubiquitination (14Govers R. van Kerkhof P. Schwartz A.L. Strous G.J. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4851-4858Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), suggesting that GHR ubiquitination occurs during or after coated pit formation. Acute cholesterol depletion of the plasma membrane using MβCD inhibits clathrin-coated pit budding. This method reduces the internalization of the transferrin receptor by >85% (27Subtil A. Gaidarov I. Kobylarz K. Lampson M.A. Keen J.H. Mcgraw T.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 6775-6780Crossref PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar). Cholesterol depletion results in the formation of shallow coated pits, indicating that cholesterol is essential for clathrin coated vesicle formation (28Rodal S.K. Skretting G. Garred O. Vilhardt F. Vandeurs B. Sandvig K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 961-974Crossref PubMed Scopus (824) Google Scholar). To monitor GH uptake, GHR-expressing ts20 cells were incubated for 30 min in the presence of Cy3-labeled GH, which resulted in the presence of Cy3-GH in endosomal and lysosomal compartments (Fig.1 A, Control). As expected, the Cy3-GH was protected against acid treatment, confirming that the label is in intracellular structures (Fig. 1 A, Acid Wash). When cells were preincubated in the presence of MβCD, virtually no Cy3-GH entered the cells (Fig. 1 A, MβCD), and the majority of label could be removed on acid treatment (Fig. 1 A, Acid Wash). Neither uptake nor binding was observed when excess unlabeled ligand was added together with Cy3-GH or when untransfected cells were used (data not shown). To confirm and quantify the effect of MβCD on endocytosis, uptake of125I-GH was measured in a time course experiment. As seen in Fig. 1 B, MβCD inhibited the internalization of GH efficiently. There was no effect of MβCD on the total binding of125I-GH to the cells (data not shown). Two control experiments were performed to ascertain that MβCD treatment did not affect other relevant cellular processes. The effect of MβCD on GHR biosynthesis was measured using pulse-chase labeling with [35S]methionine (Fig.2 A). The receptor was synthesized as a 110-kDa glycoprotein precursor (double band; Fig.2 A, p) and on “complex glycosylation” in the Golgi complex converted to a 130-kDa mature species (Fig.2 A, m). Quantification of the radioactivity showed that the GHR signal in the MβCD cells is ∼85–90% of the control cells, indicating a slight inhibition of protein synthesis. Conversion of precursor to mature receptor was detectable after 30 min of chase both in control and in MβCD-treated cells, indicating that transport to the Golgi compartment was not affected by the cholesterol depletion. To examine the effect of MβCD on GHR phosphorylation, a second control experiment was performed. Allevato and colleagues (29Allevato G. Billestrup N. Goujon L. Galsgaard E.D. Norstedt G. Nielsen J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17210-17214Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) showed that a mutated GHR, deficient in internalization, was capable of stimulating transcription of the serine protease inhibitor 2.1 promoter, and we showed that the GHR cytosolic tail is tyrosine-phosphorylated, while internalization is inhibited (14Govers R. van Kerkhof P. Schwartz A.L. Strous G.J. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4851-4858Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 20Strous G.J. van Kerkhof P. Govers R. Rotwein P. Schwartz A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 40-43Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). From these studies it was concluded that GHR phosphorylation is independent of GHR endocytosis. MβCD-pretreated cells were incubated for various periods with GH. As seen in Fig. 2 B, phosphorylation became detectable after 5 min of incubation, reaching a maximum after 15 min for both control and MβCD-treated cells. The blot was reprobed with anti-GHR to show that comparable amounts of receptor were loaded in each lane. From these results we conclude that MβCD treatment has no effect on GH-induced phosphorylation of the GHR, indicating that activation of the tyrosine kinase (Janus kinase 2) and receptor dimerization can take place in the presence of MβCD. Previously, it was shown that MβCD does not interfere with the association of clathrin to the plasma membrane but has an inhibitory effect on the invagination and fission of clathrin-coated pits (28Rodal S.K. Skretting G. Garred O. Vilhardt F. Vandeurs B. Sandvig K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 961-974Crossref PubMed Scopus (824) Google Scholar). For the present study it was important to determine whether the GHR enters these clathrin-coated areas at the plasma membrane of MβCD-treated cells. Immunogold labeling of clathrin in GHR-expressing ts20 cells revealed that the majority of plasma membrane-associated clathrin was present on deeply invaginated pits and coated vesicles in close vicinity to the plasma membrane (Fig.3 A and TableI). GH was regularly found in the deeply invaginated clathrin-coated pits and vesicles (Fig. 3, C andD), as well as in later compartments of the endocytic pathway (data not shown). In MβCD-treated cells, the total number of clathrin-coated structures at the plasma membrane was increased twice compared with that in control cells. In contrast to control cells, >85% of the clathrin-containing structures were flattened coated pits (Fig. 3 B). Deeply invaginated coated pits and coated vesicles were rarely seen (Table I). GH accumulated at the plasma membrane, where it regularly but not exclusively occurred in the flattened clathrin-coated pits (Fig. 3 E). These findings suggest that the GH-GHR complex in MβCD-treated cells indeed enters the clathrin-coated areas of the plasma membrane.Table IPercentage of clathrin-coated structures at the plasma membraneIn MβCD-treated and control cells, clathrin-coated structures at the plasma membrane of 50 cell profiles were counted and categorized into the four indicated stages (see “Experimental Procedures” for details). The occurrence of a specific stage is expressed as a percentage of the total number of clathrin-coated structures per condition. In MβCD-treated and control cells 310 and 145 clathrin-coated structures were counted, respectively. Open table in a new tab In MβCD-treated and control cells, clathrin-coated structures at the plasma membrane of 50 cell profiles were counted and categorized into the four indicated stages (see “Experimental Procedures” for details). The occurrence of a specific stage is expressed as a percentage of the total number of clathrin-coated structures per condition. In MβCD-treated and control cells 310 and 145 clathrin-coated structures were counted, respectively. To address the question of whether the GHR is ubiquitinated after MβCD treatment, cells were incubated with or without GH, and ubiquitinated proteins were immunoprecipitated and analyzed by Western blotting, as indicated in Fig. 4. Ubiquitinated GHR appeared as high molecular weight species in the top part of the gel (Fig.4 A). Control cells (lanes 3 and 4) showed increased GHR ubiquitination on ligand binding. Both in unstimulated and stimulated cells the level of GHR ubiquitination increased when MβCD was present (Fig. 4 A, comparelane 3 with lane 9 and lane 4 withlane 10). The use of untransfected cells resulted, as expected, in the absence of signal for ubiquitinated GHR (ts20; Fig.4 A, lanes 1 and 2). When endocytosis was inhibited by potassium depletion, GHR ubiquitination was almost completely abolished (lanes 5 and 6). Ubiquitination was restored to control values by adding 10 mm KCl (lanes 7 and 8). Reprobing the blot from Fig. 4 A with anti-ubiquitin showed that the amount of immunoprecipitated, ubiquitinated protein in each lane was comparable (Fig. 4 B). These results show that the GHR is ubiquitinated at the cell surface before constriction of the coated pit occurs and suggest that assembly of the clathrin coat is a requirement for GHR ubiquitination. To examine the effect of inhibition of clathrin-mediated endocytosis on GHR ubiquitination by an independent method, we used a HeLa cell line expressing a temperature-sensitive mutant of human dynamin, dynTS. DynTS carries a point mutation corresponding to the Drosophila shibire ts1 allele (30Damke H. Baba T. van der Bliek A.M. Schmid S.L. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 69-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). For this dynamin mutant it has been shown that transferrin internalization is inhibited at the nonpermissive temperature, that the phenotype is rapid and reversible, and that invaginated but not constricted coated pits accumulate on the cytoplasmic surface of the plasma membrane. HeLa cells were transiently transfected with wild-type GHR cDNA and incubated in the presence of GH; afterward the GH-GHR complex was immunoprecipitated with anti-GH. Using this approach, only mature GHR species from the cell surface were immunoprecipitated. At the permissive temperature, ubiquitinated protein was detected in both the wild-type and mutant dynamin cells (Fig. 5 A, anti-Ubi). After shifting the cells to the nonpermissive temperature, an incr"

These two proteins are expressed in odontoblasts and preameloblasts as a single cDNA transcript coding a large precursor protein termed dentin sialophosphoprotein (DSPP). DSPP is specifically cleaved into two unique proteins, DSP and DPP. However, the cleavage site(s) of DSPP and the mechanisms for regulating the cleavages are unknown. To identify the specific site(s) of DSPP that are cleaved when the initial translation product is converted to DSP and DPP, we performed a detailed analysis (Edman degradation and mass spectrometry) on selected tryptic peptides of a size originating from the COOH-terminal region of rat DSP. After cleavage with trypsin, the DSP fragments were separated by a two-dimensional method (size-exclusion chromatography followed by reversed phase high performance liquid chromatography). We characterized 13 peptides from various regions of DSP. The analyses showed that peptide Ile409-Tyr421 was the major COOH-terminal fragment, ending at Tyr421 only 9 residues from the NH2 terminus of DPP. Peptide Gln385-His406 represented a second, minor COOH-terminal peptide that terminated at His406. Both of these residues are well beyond the COOH terminus predicted previously by two independent studies estimating that rat DSP contained 360–370 amino acids. Careful studies on two peptides showed that, among 9 potential casein kinase II phosphorylation sites, 2 serines were phosphorylated. We found that rat DSP was heterogeneous with respect to phosphorylation, because this same peptide sequence eluted in two discrete peaks, one with 2 phosphoserines and the other having 1. The finding that 3 lysines just preceding the COOH termini were modified by a 43-Da substituent (possibly a carbamoyl substituent) suggests that the lysines in this region were particularly susceptible to attachment of this substituent.

The most unusual feature of DPP is the occurrence of large amounts of Asp and phosphoserine (7Ritchie H.H. Wang L.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21695-21698Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 8George A. Bannon L. Sabsay B. Dillon J.W. Malone J. Veis A Jenkins N.A. Gilbert D.J. Copeland N.G. J.

Many of these residues are present in repeating sequences of (Asp-phosphoserine-phosphoserine)n and (Asp-phosphoserine)n. Energy minimization modeling techniques (8George A. Bannon L. Sabsay B.

Chem. 1996; 271: 32869-32873Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar) indicate that these repeating sequences of phosphoserine and aspartic acid assume extended backbone structures with relatively long ridges of carboxylate and phosphate groups on each side of the peptide backbone. These structures fit well with the purported function of DPP in the nucleation and modulation of hydroxyapatite crystal formation (6Butler W.T. Eur. J. Oral. Sci. 1998; 106: 204-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). DSP, a sialic acid-rich glycoprotein first discovered in our laboratory (11Butler W.T. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 255: 290-303Crossref Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 12Butler W.T. Bhown M. D'Souza R.N. Farach-Carson M.C. Happonen R.P. Schrohenloher R.E. Seyer J.M. Somerman M.J. Foster R.A. Tomana M. VanDijk S. Matrix. 1992; 12: 343-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar), accounts for 5–8% of the dentin noncollagenous proteins. This protein shares overall characteristics with other sialoproteins (OPN, bone sialoprotein, and Dmp-1) from bone and dentin, but the levels of sequence similarities are low. Nevertheless, the fact that the genes for DSP, Dmp-1, bone sialoprotein, and OPN are found at a similar chromosomal location (i.e. on human chromosome 4q21–4q23) suggests some type of ancestral relationship (13Feng J.Q. Luan X. Wallace J. Jing D. Ohshima T. Kulkarni A.B. D'Souza R.N. Kozak C.A. MacDougall M. J. Biol.

DSP is a glycoprotein with 29.6% carbohydrate, including 9% sialic acid (12Butler W.T. Bhown M. D'Souza R.N. Farach-Carson M.C. Happonen R.P. Schrohenloher R.E. Seyer J.M. Somerman M.J. Foster R.A. Tomana M. VanDijk S. Matrix. 1992; 12: 343-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). The molecular mass for DSP, determined by analytical ultracentrifugation, was 52,570 Da. When the 29.6% carbohydrate content was taken into account, the molecular mass for the core protein was calculated to be 37,009 Da (12Butler W.T. Bhown M. D'Souza R.N. Farach-Carson M.C.

From this molecular mass and the average residue mass, the number of amino acid residues was calculated to be 359 (12Butler W.T. Bhown M. D'Souza R.N. Farach-Carson M.C. Happonen R.P. Schrohenloher R.E. Seyer J.M. Somerman M.J. Foster R.A. Tomana M. VanDijk S. Matrix. 1992; 12: 343-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). With Edman degradation, the NH2-terminal sequence was shown to be IPVPQLVPL (17Ritchie H.H. Hou H. Veis A. Butler W.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3698-3702Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cloning and sequence determination of a rat DSP cDNA were used to deduce the amino acid sequence (17Ritchie H.H. Hou H. Veis A. Butler W.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3698-3702Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). With the known NH2terminus, this analysis indicated that DSP contained 366 amino acids. The molecular mass calculated from the predicated 366 residues, when added to that for the carbohydrate mass, was ∼53 kDa, identical to that determined by analytical ultracentrifugation (12Butler W.T. Bhown M. D'Souza R.N. Farach-Carson M.C. Happonen R.P. Schrohenloher R.E. Seyer J.M. Somerman M.J. Foster R.A. Tomana M. VanDijk S.

The calculated amino acid composition for the predicted sequence was identical to that determined for the protein (12Butler W.T. Bhown M. D'Souza R.N. Farach-Carson M.C. Happonen R.P.

Chem. 1994; 269: 3698-3702Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the length of DSP was determined by two independent methods, and the conclusions in each case of ∼360 amino acids were in close agreement. It was shown later that a single-base mistake in the original rat DSP cDNA sequencing created a frame shift leading to an early stop codon following the coding sequence for residue 366 (10MacDougall M.

Oral Sci. 1998; 106: 211-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The corrected sequence creates an open reading frame and a sequence containing a 5′-DSP sequence and a 3′-DPP sequence (see below). MacDougall et al. (10MacDougall M. Simmons D. Luan X. Nydegger J.

Chem. 1998; 273: 9457-9464Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar) discovered that the nucleotide sequences for mouse DSP and DPP reside on the same gene coding for a single cDNA transcript. This transcript would result in a translational protein product termed dentin sialophosphoprotein (DSPP) that would be specifically cleaved into two proteins, DSP and DPP, with unique physical and chemical characteristics. Analysis of the full-length cDNA revealed a 934-amino acid open reading frame corresponding to the mouse DSPP, including a 17-amino acid signal peptide. The signal peptide and the deduced sequence of the NH2-terminal portion (amino acids 1–360 numbered from the NH2 terminus of the secreted protein) of the mouse DSPP were 75% homologous to the sequence of rat DSP. The NH2-terminal sequence of rat DPP determined by Edman degradation was Asp-Asp-Pro-Asn for rat HP2 (a highly phosphorylated DPP; Ref. 19Butler W.T. Bhown M. Dimuzio M.T. Cothran W.C. Linde A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1983; 225: 178-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), and in human it was shown to be Asp-Asp-Pro (20Chang S.R. Chiego Jr., D. Clarkson B.H. Calcif. Tissue. Int. 1996; 58: 149-153Crossref Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The beginning of the DPP portion of mouse DSPP (10MacDougall M. Simmons D. Luan X. Nydegger J. Feng J. Gu T.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 835-842Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar) was established from the rat NH2-terminal sequence Asp-Asp-Pro-Asn (see Fig. 1). Beginning with the mouse Asp-Asp-Pro sequence, mouse DPP was shown to contain 483 amino acids. The amino acid sequence of this portion was highly similar to that of the rat DPP cDNA reported by Ritchie and Wang (7Ritchie H.H. Wang L.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21695-21698Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) and by George et al. (9George A. Srinivasan R. Thotakurn S. Veis A. Eur. J. Oral Sci. 1998; 106: 221-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Thus, the 5′ region of this mouse DSPP clone is identical to that of rat DSP cDNA (17Ritchie H.H. Hou H. Veis A. Butler W.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3698-3702Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the 3′ region is the same as that of the rat DPP (7Ritchie H.H. Wang L.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21695-21698Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 9George A. Srinivasan R. Thotakurn S. Veis A. Eur. J. Oral Sci. 1998; 106: 221-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). In situ hybridization with riboprobes specifically designed for DSP, DPP, and the “linker” (dsp-dpp) regions of the mouse DSPP nucleotide sequence showed a strict coexpression of the three probes in odontoblasts and preameloblasts (21Bègue-Kirn C. Ruch J.-V. Ridall A.L. Butler W.T. Eur. J. Oral Sci. 1998; 106: 254-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The fact that the dsp-dpp linker sequence remains identically codistributed with DSP and DPP sequences suggests that formation of DSP and DPP molecules takes place after translation of a single transcript (21Bègue-Kirn C. Ruch J.-V. Ridall A.L. Butler W.T. Eur. J. Oral Sci. 1998; 106: 254-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Recently Gu et al.(22Gu K. Chang S. Ritchie H.H. Clarkson B.H. Rutherford R.B. Eur. J. Oral Sci. 2000; 108: 35-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) cloned a human DSPP gene with genomic organization very similar to that of mouse DSPP. All these data support the hypothesis that DSP and DPP represent specific cleavage products of a large precursor protein. However, the cleavage site(s) for the precursor protein DSPP and the mechanism for conversion to DSP and DPP are unknown. The NH2-terminal sequences for rat (7Ritchie H.H. Wang L.H. J. Biol.

As stated earlier, in two independent studies, the rat DSP was estimated to contain ∼360 amino acids, and the cleavage site of the DSPP precursor was predicted to be very near residue 366 (6Butler W.T. Eur. J. Oral. Sci. 1998; 106: 204-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar, 12Butler W.T. Bhown M. D'Souza R.N. Farach-Carson M.C. Happonen R.P. Schrohenloher R.E. Seyer J.M. Somerman M.J.

On the basis of this conclusion and the site of the NH2-terminal residue of DPP, Asp431 (in rat), it was postulated that an intervening sequence of ∼64 amino acids between DSP and DPP was cleaved out before or after secretion of DSPP (6Butler W.T. Eur. J. Oral. Sci. 1998; 106: 204-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Our primary objective in this study was to identify the specific sites of DSPP that are cleaved when the initial translation product is converted to DSP and DPP. DSP tryptic peptides were purified by a two-dimensional method, size-exclusion chromatography followed by reversed phase high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). With the former method, we selected peptides that were 10–25 residues in length, a size expected of most of the tryptic peptides of rat DSPP between residues 366 and 431 (see Fig. 1). Fortuitously, two of these peptides were COOH-terminal ends, as indicated by COOH-terminal amino acids other than lysine or arginine. These two tryptic peptides, originating from residues Gln385-His406 and Ile409-Tyr421 (as shown by cDNA deduced sequences), are those representing minor and major COOH-terminal ends, respectively. We also performed a detailed analysis on other tryptic peptides. In addition to sequences from the NH2-terminal and central regions of DSP, our investigation led to a complete sequence analysis of the COOH-terminal region beyond residue 366 and to the identification of two phosphoserines. DSP was isolated from rat dentin by standard procedures as described (11Butler W.T. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 255: 290-303Crossref Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 12Butler W.T. Bhown M. D'Souza R.N. Farach-Carson M.C. Happonen R.P. Schrohenloher R.E. Seyer J.M. Somerman M.J. Foster R.A. Tomana M. VanDijk S. Matrix. 1992; 12: 343-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Briefly, rat incisor pieces were extracted with 0.5 m EDTA in 4 mguanidium-HCl (GdmCl; Acros Organics) containing protease inhibitors. Next, EDTA extracts were subjected to gel chromatography on Sephacryl S-200 in GdmCl. Using this procedure, the high molecular weight protein fraction (ES1) was separated from osteocalcin, which eluted in an included volume (ES2). ES1 was next chromatographed on diethylaminoethyl-Sephacel, eluted with a linear gradient formed from 750 ml of each starting buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, 6m urea, pH 7.2) and 50 mm Tris-HCl, 6m urea, pH 7.2, containing 0.7 m NaCl. DSP eluted in a position in the gradient corresponding to ∼0.2m NaCl; this peak, referred to as fraction B (11Butler W.T. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 255: 290-303Crossref Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 12Butler W.T. Bhown M. D'Souza R.N. Farach-Carson M.C. Happonen R.P. Schrohenloher R.E. Seyer J.M. Somerman M.J. Foster R.A. Tomana M. VanDijk S. Matrix. 1992; 12: 343-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar), was further purified by gel filtration on a Biogel A1.5m in 4 mGdmCl, Tris-HCl, pH 7.2. DSP eluted in one major peak, separated from lower molecular weight proteins (see Fig. 1 in Ref. 12Butler W.T. Bhown M. D'Souza R.N. Farach-Carson M.C. Happonen R.P. Schrohenloher R.E. Seyer J.M. Somerman M.J. Foster R.A. Tomana M. VanDijk S. Matrix. 1992; 12: 343-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). The purity of DSP was assessed by 5–15% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The samples of DSP displayed one major protein band at about Mr 95,000. In addition, two minor bands at Mr 75,000 and 65,000 were often observed (see Ref. 12Butler W.T. Bhown M. D'Souza R.N. Farach-Carson M.C. Happonen R.P. Schrohenloher R.E. Seyer J.M. Somerman M.J. Foster R.A. Tomana M. VanDijk S. Matrix. 1992; 12: 343-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Each of these minor DSP bands reacted with DSP antibodies on Western immunoblots (data not shown), and we believe that they represent fragments of DSP; their presence did not interfere with the studies reported here. Note that the presence of either GdmCl or urea in each step of this preparative procedure prevented artifactual degradation of DSP. DSP was digested overnight at 37 °C with trypsin (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) at an enzyme:substrate ratio of 1:50 in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. The final concentration of trypsin was 20 μg/ml. Before the addition of trypsin, the chymotrypsin inhibitorl-1-tosylamido-2-phenylethyl chloromethyl ketone (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) was added to a final concentration of 100 μg/ml to inhibit possible chymotrypsin activity. After trypsin digestion of DSP, HPLC separation of peptides gave rise to a large number of overlapping peptide peaks that would be less useful in our structure determination. Therefore, peptides were separated using a two-dimensional approach to produce a series of pure peptides that could be unambiguously characterized. Another objective was to obtain peptides with sizes that were likely to emanate from the COOH-terminal region of DSP. Inspection of the sequence (Fig. 1) showed that trypsin cleavage at lysyl and arginyl bonds would result in several peptides of 11 to 22 amino acids from that area. This approach did not ensure that a COOH-terminal peptide would be in this size range. In the first phase, peptides were separated according to size on Superdex 75 HR 10/30 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated and eluted at 0.5 ml/min in 4 m GdmCl (SigmaUltra, pH 6.0). Using fast protein liquid chromatography, the eluant was monitored at 280 nm. DSP peptides separated into six peaks, and each peak was subdivided into three or four subfractions. Subfractions containing peptides with desired sizes were selected for a second phase HPLC separation. In the second phase, each selected subfraction was subjected to HPLC with a 2.1 × 250-mm C18 reversed phase column (Vydac). For optimal separations, two separate HPLC gradient systems were used, depending on the types of peptides to be purified. The first approach used a 3–35% acetonitrile linear gradient in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid over 100 min at a flow rate of 300 μl/min; this gradient was used to separate most of the peptides. The second elution approach was to initially wash with water (0% acetonitrile) for 30 min before starting the 0–30% acetonitrile gradient (0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, 300 μl/min over 100 min). This latter gradient system was used to separate hydrophilic peptides because of difficulties in achieving purity; using the first approach, these peptides emerged from HPLC in short times and were of low purity. For all HPLC separations, the eluant was monitored at 218 nm, and peaks were collected by hand. Most purified peptides of desired sizes from HPLC were first sequenced by Edman degradation on Applied Biosystems ABI 473A and 477A sequencers using standard techniques. Next, they were further analyzed for molecular mass and sequence by mass spectrometry. For mass spectrometry, the samples were dried under vacuum and redissolved in aqueous solution containing ∼50% methanol and 1% formic acid. Aliquots of the solutions were deposited in metal coated glass nanoelectrospray capillary tubes for analysis on a PE Sciex API 3000 triple quadrupole mass spectrometer (Concord) equipped with a Protana nanoelectrospray source (Odense). The samples were analyzed by one or more of the following regimens. For determination of peptide molecular mass, full scan mass spectra were recorded using Q1 as the resolving analyzer in positive ion mode. Product ion spectra were aquired using Q1 to transmit the precursor ion of interest to the radio frequency-only collision cell Q2 under collisionally activated decomposition conditions. Nitrogen was the collision gas, and collision energies in the range of 20–50-electron volt product ions were analyzed using Q3 to determine peptide sequence. Phosphorylated peptides were detected by scanning Q1 for negative ion precursors of the m/z 79.1 product ion, formed under collisionally activated decomposition conditions in Q2 at a collision energy of 120 electron volts with Q3 as a mass filter to detect the product ion. Fig.1 shows the cDNA deduced rat DSPP sequence of the region from the NH2 terminus of secreted DSP to the established NH2 terminus of DPP. Because a full-length rat DSPP cDNA has never been reported, we based this cDNA sequence on the published data from three studies. The first two are by Ritchie et al. (17Ritchie H.H. Hou H. Veis A. Butler W.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3698-3702Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and Ritchie and Wang (7Ritchie H.H. Wang L.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21695-21698Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), who reported the cDNA sequence for rat DSP and DPP in two independent papers. The third reference is by George et al. (9George A. Srinivasan R. Thotakurn S. Veis A. Eur. J. Oral Sci. 1998; 106: 221-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) who published a cDNA sequence for rat Dmp3, representing the same region as the mouse DSPP. In formulating this sequence we also referred to the mouse DSPP sequence reported by MacDougall et al.(10MacDougall M. Simmons D. Luan X. Nydegger J. Feng J. Gu T.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 835-842Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar) for comparison. Amino acids are numbered from the NH2terminus of secreted DSP, excluding the 17-amino acid signal peptide. Direct HPLC analysis of peptides generated by digestion of DSP with trypsin resulted in poor separations (results not shown) attributable to the high degree of heterogeneity; using only this separation technique would make sequencing of most peptides impossible. To improve the separation, a trypsin digest of DSP was first applied to a Superdex 75 gel filtration column to separate peptides according to size. DSP tryptic peptides were separated into six major peaks on Superdex 75 (results not shown). Because there were still too many peptides in each major peak to obtain ideal purification and analysis, we subdivided each peak into three or four subfractions. Totally, we obtained 22 subfractions, some of which were selected for the next dimension: HPLC separation (Fig. 2). This two-dimensional separation technique enabled us to obtain a number of pure peptides suitable for sequencing by Edman degradation and mass spectrometry (MS). In our efforts to obtain peptides from the COOH-terminal region of DSP, we used the predicted cDNA sequence (Fig. 1) as a guide. We reasoned that, after treatment of DSP with trypsin, we should obtain peptides comprising ∼10–25 amino acids from residue 366 to the beginning of DPP (residue 431). To be more specific, we expected tryptic peptides of 22, 11, 13, 4, and 12 residues from the COOH-terminal region (see Fig. 1). From the trypsin digest we selected peptides of ∼10–25 amino acids by gel filtration and purified them by HPLC. In fact, we characterized 13 peptides arising not only from the COOH terminus but also from the NH2 terminus and the central regions of DSP (Figs. 1 and3). These peptides, accounting for 167 amino acids, were sequenced by a combination of Edman microsequencing and MS peptide sequencing. For confirmation of the structures of most peptides, we compared the theoretical molecular mass with that determined by MS. Fig. 3 shows the data for the 13 peptides, which form the basis for our conclusions in this publication. The identification of COOH-terminal peptides, after tryptic digestion, was made by searching for peptides with a COOH-terminal amino acid other than lysine or arginine. Although we realized that such a peptide might terminate at any point and might not occur in the selected size range, we actually identified two COOH-terminal peptides, containing 13 and 22 amino acids. One of these peptides was peptide 13 (Fig. 3). This peptide, Ile409-Tyr421 was first partially sequenced by Edman degradation and then fully sequenced by tandem MS. The theoretical molecular mass (1325.4 Da) agreed with that determined by MS (1325.5 Da). The yield of peptide Ile409-Tyr421 was high, as indicated by peak areas and by the phenylthiohydantoin (PTH)-derivative yield during Edman degradation. The peak area ratio between peptide Ile409-Tyr421 and another tyrosine-containing peptid"
https://openalex.org/W2000537633,"Human cystathionine β-synthase is a pyridoxal 5′-phosphate enzyme containing a heme binding domain and an S-adenosyl-l-methionine regulatory site. We have investigated by single crystal microspectrophotometry the functional properties of a mutant lacking the S-adenosylmethionine binding domain. Polarized absorption spectra indicate that oxidized and reduced hemes are reversibly formed. Exposure of the reduced form of enzyme crystals to carbon monoxide led to the complete release of the heme moiety. This process, which takes place reversibly and without apparent crystal damage, facilitates the preparation of a heme-free human enzyme. The heme-free enzyme crystals exhibited polarized absorption spectra typical of a pyridoxal 5′-phosphate-dependent protein. The exposure of these crystals to increasing concentrations of the natural substratel-serine readily led to the formation of the key catalytic intermediate α-aminoacrylate. The dissociation constant ofl-serine was found to be 6 mm, close to that determined in solution. The amount of the α-aminoacrylate Schiff base formed in the presence of l-serine was pH independent between 6 and 9. However, the rate of the disappearance of the α-aminoacrylate, likely forming pyruvate and ammonia, was found to increase at pH values higher than 8. Finally, in the presence of homocysteine the α-aminoacrylate-enzyme absorption band readily disappears with the concomitant formation of the absorption band of the internal aldimine, indicating that cystathionine β-synthase crystals catalyze both β-elimination and β-replacement reactions. Taken together, these findings demonstrate that the heme moiety is not directly involved in the condensation reaction catalyzed by cystathionine β-synthase. Human cystathionine β-synthase is a pyridoxal 5′-phosphate enzyme containing a heme binding domain and an S-adenosyl-l-methionine regulatory site. We have investigated by single crystal microspectrophotometry the functional properties of a mutant lacking the S-adenosylmethionine binding domain. Polarized absorption spectra indicate that oxidized and reduced hemes are reversibly formed. Exposure of the reduced form of enzyme crystals to carbon monoxide led to the complete release of the heme moiety. This process, which takes place reversibly and without apparent crystal damage, facilitates the preparation of a heme-free human enzyme. The heme-free enzyme crystals exhibited polarized absorption spectra typical of a pyridoxal 5′-phosphate-dependent protein. The exposure of these crystals to increasing concentrations of the natural substratel-serine readily led to the formation of the key catalytic intermediate α-aminoacrylate. The dissociation constant ofl-serine was found to be 6 mm, close to that determined in solution. The amount of the α-aminoacrylate Schiff base formed in the presence of l-serine was pH independent between 6 and 9. However, the rate of the disappearance of the α-aminoacrylate, likely forming pyruvate and ammonia, was found to increase at pH values higher than 8. Finally, in the presence of homocysteine the α-aminoacrylate-enzyme absorption band readily disappears with the concomitant formation of the absorption band of the internal aldimine, indicating that cystathionine β-synthase crystals catalyze both β-elimination and β-replacement reactions. Taken together, these findings demonstrate that the heme moiety is not directly involved in the condensation reaction catalyzed by cystathionine β-synthase. cystathionine β-synthase pyridoxal 5′-phosphate polyethylene glycol High plasmatic levels of homocysteine have recently been associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease (1Refsum H. Ueland P. Nygard O. Vollset S.E. Annu. Rev. Med. 1998; 49: 31-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (1832) Google Scholar). Homocysteine is formed from S-adenosylhomocysteine and is either removed by cystathionine β-synthase (EC 4.2.1.22, CBS)1 in the trans-sulfuration pathway or remethylated to methionine in the methionine cycle. Deficiency of CBS is the major cause of inherited homocystinuria. CBS is a pyridoxal 5′-phosphate (PLP)-dependent enzyme catalyzing the synthesis of cystathionine from homocysteine and l-serine. The reaction proceeds via a β-replacement mechanism, similar to that of tryptophan synthase and O-acetylserine sulfhydrylase (2Borcsok E. Abeles R.H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1982; 213: 695-707Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). These enzymes belong to the β-family and fold II type within the PLP-dependent enzymes classification (3Alexander F.W. Sandmeier E. Metha P.K. Christen P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 291: 953-960Crossref Scopus (343) Google Scholar, 4Grishin N.V. Phillips M.A. Goldsmith E.J. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 1291-1304Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). Other members of the β-family are serine and threonine dehydratases. The human CBS is a 63-kDa homotetramer containing one PLP and one heme per subunit (5Kery V. Bukovska G. Kraus J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25283-25288Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Whereas the functional role of PLP is known, the role of the heme is less clear. It was demonstrated that the heme redox state affects the affinity of the enzyme for the substrates (6Taoka S. Ohja S. Shan X.Y. Kruger W.D. Banerjee R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25179-25184Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). Moreover, the catalytic activity of CBS is controlled by S-adenosylmethionine, which specifically binds to a C-terminal site. The trypsinolysis of a 18 kDa C-terminal fragment leads to a dimeric form, 2-fold more active than the native species and no longer regulated by S-adenosylmethionine (7Kery V. Poneleit L. Kraus J.P. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1998; 355: 222-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar).

Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 13155-13161Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Investigation of the catalytic reaction brought about by PLP is complicated by the overlapping chromophoric properties of the heme. The recent investigation of the yeast enzyme, which does not contain heme groups, permitted a better characterization of the PLP role in the catalytic steps (9Jhee K.H. McPhie P. Miles E.W. J. Biol.

The nucleophilic attack of homocysteine on the α-aminoacrylate led to the formation of the product cystathionine. However, it is not yet known how closely the functional properties of the yeast enzyme resemble those of the human source.Structural studies of catalytic intermediates of tryptophan synthase and O-acetylserine sulfhydrylase (11Miles E.W.

A common feature is an open to closed conformational transition of the active site taking place along the catalytic pathway.

We have recently expressed and purified to near homogeneity recombinant human CBS comprising amino acid residues 2–413. This enzyme, missing 138 C-terminal residues, forms dimers, is not activated by S-adenosyl-l-methionine, and does not exhibit the aggregating properties of the full-length enzyme. In addition, the recombinant CBS polypeptide contains a 23-amino acid spacer at its N terminus. The truncated enzyme still binds PLP and heme and is about 2 times more active than the full-length CBS (25Janosik, M., Meier, M., Kery, V., Oliveriusova, J., Burkhard, P, and Kraus, J. P. (2000) Acta Crystallogr., in pressGoogle Scholar). Crystals of the recombinant active core of CBS have been obtained, and the three-dimensional structure is being determined (26McPherson A.

Here, we have studied the reactivity of these crystals by polarized absorption microspectrophotometry as an essential prerequisite to the crystallographic analysis of the enzyme and the structure to function correlation.CONCLUSIONCryo-crystallography (33Douzo P.

Detailed functional studies of protein crystals by spectroscopic techniques have allowed us to define the experimental conditions for the accumulation of catalytic intermediates, thus directing the crystallographic measurements. These conditions are not always similar to those derived by experiments in solution, because crystal lattice forces affect the relative stability of catalytic intermediates in unpredictable ways. Examples are the different effect of cations on the accumulation of the quinonoid species of tryptophan synthase in the crystal and in solution (22Mozzarelli A. Peracchi A. Rovegno B. Dale G.

For the first time, it has also been demonstrated that the heme does not participate in PLP-dependent catalysis of CBS. However, further investigations in solution are required to assess the fine-tuning of ligand binding and catalysis by the heme moiety.

It has 234 amino acids consisting of a central RGS box and short divergent NH2 and COOH termini. The calculated molecular weight of RGS18 is 27,610 and the isoelectric point is 8.63. Mouse RGS18 is expressed from a single gene and shows tissue specific distribution. It is most highly expressed in bone marrow followed by fetal liver, spleen, and then lung. In bone marrow, RGS18 level is highest in long-term and short-term hematopoietic stem cells, and is decreased as they differentiate into more committed multiple progenitors. The human RGS18 ortholog has a tissue-specific expression pattern similar to that of mouse RGS18. Purified RGS18 interacts with the α subunit of both Gi and Gq subfamilies. The results of in vitro GTPase single-turnover assays using Gαi indicated that RGS18 accelerates the intrinsic GTPase activity of Gαi. Transient overexpression of RGS18 attenuated inositol phosphates production via angiotensin receptor and transcriptional activation through cAMP-responsive element via M1 muscarinic receptor. This suggests RGS18 can act on Gq-mediated signaling pathways in vivo.

Thorner J. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1991; 60: 653-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (1136) Google Scholar). Inactive G-proteins are heterotrimeric proteins consisting of α, β, and γ subunits. Upon binding of a specific ligand to the G-protein-coupled receptor, the receptor promotes the exchange of GDP to GTP in the α subunit, resulting in dissociation of the α subunit from the βγ subunits. The βγ subunits are tightly associated and do not dissociate under physiological conditions. The free α subunit and βγ subunits then transmit signals through various signal transduction pathways. The activated α subunit has slow intrinsic GTPase activity. When the α subunit is in the GDP-bound form, it re-associates with the βγ subunits, leading to an inactive form. The duration of the G-protein signal depends on the rate of GTP hydrolysis and the rate of subunit re-association. For small GTP-binding proteins such as ras, there are GAP1 proteins (GTPase activating protein), which increase the GTP hydrolysis rate. Recently, functional homologs of the ras-GAP have been identified for the heterotrimeric G-protein. These are called RGS (regulator of G-proteinsignaling) proteins. The first RGS identified, Sst2 (supersensitivity to pheromone) in yeast, is a negative regulator of pheromone signaling (2Dietzel C. Kurjan J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 4169-4177Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Later, the SST2 gene product was shown to function as a GAP for Gpa1, a molecule involved in pheromone desensitization (3Apanovitch D.M. Slep K.C. Sigler P.B. Dohlman H.G. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 4815-4822Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). So far ∼20 RGS have been identified (4De Vries L. Mousli M. Wurmser A. Farquhar M.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

All RGS proteins have a highly conserved domain consisting of 120 amino acid residues, the RGS box, with varying lengths of NH2 and COOH termini. RGS4 can be expressed in bacteria, and it has been co-crystallized with Gαi1 as the GDP-AlF4−-bound form (13Tesmer J.J.G. Berman D.M. Gilman A.G. Sprang S.R. Cell. 1997; 89: 251-261Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (687) Google Scholar). It was shown that RGS binds to Gαi through the switch region, and that site-directed mutagenesis of the contact residues lead to loss of interaction (14Lan K.L. Sarvazyan N.A. Taussig R.

In vitro most purified native or recombinant RGS proteins can bind Gαq and/or Gαi via the RGS box (4De Vries L. Mousli M. Wurmser A. Farquhar M.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 11916-11920Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar,6Hunt T.W. Fields T.A. Casey P.J. Peralta E.G. Nature. 1996; 383: 175-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar, 17Berman D.M.

Overexpression by transient transfection of a RGS into mammalian cells can attenuate signaling from Gi and/or Gq-linked receptors (20Heximer P.S. Watson N. Linder M.E. Blimer K.J. Hepler J.R. Proc.

The very recently discovered RGS protein, p115RhoGEF, can act as a GTPase activator for Gα12 and Gα13 (23Kozasa T. Jiang X. Hart V.H. Kehrl J.H. Science. 1996; 280: 2109-2111Crossref Scopus (740) Google Scholar). No RGS that can act on Gαs in mammals has been found so far. However, in yeast, Rgs2 was shown to function as a negative regulator of glucose-induced cAMP signaling through direct GTPase activation of the Gαs protein Gpa2 (24Versele M. de Winde J.H. Thevelein J.M. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5577-5591Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). There seems to be tissue specific distribution of RGS. For example, RGS1 is predominantly expressed in B-lymphocytes (8Hong J.X. Wilson G.L. Fox C.H. Kehrl J.H. J. Immunol. 1993; 150: 3895-3904PubMed Google Scholar) and monocytes (25Heximer P.S.

Chem. 1999; 274: 26860-26868Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), and RGS4 is expressed in neural tissue (27Nomoto S. Adachi K. Yang L.X. Hirata Y. Muraguchi S. Kiuchi K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 241: 281-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). RGS1, RGS2, RGS3, RGS4, and RGS16 are present in lymphocytes (28Beadling C. Druey K.M.

In this paper, we describe cloning of a novel RGS from a long-term hematopoietic stem cell cDNA library. The new RGS, designated as RGS18, is highly expressed in long-term as well as short-term hematopoietic stem cells, and less in more committed hematopoietic populations. RGS18 can bind both Gαi and Gαq in vitro, enhance GTPase activity of Gαi, and attenuate signals from Gq-coupled receptors. Human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293T cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mm glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Jurkat human leukemic T lymphocyte (clone E6–1), chronic myelogenous leukemia K-562, acute lymphoblastic leukemia MOLT-3, Burkitt lymphoma Ramos (RA1), and histocytic lymphoma U-937 cells were obtained from American Type Culture Collections and maintained in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, glutamine, penicillin, streptomycin, and Trizol were obtained from Life Technologies, Inc., and RPMI 1640 was from BioWhittaker. Fetal bovine serum was from HyClone. Leupeptin and glycogen were purchased from Roche Molecular Biochemicals, pepstatin A, benzamidine, TLCK, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, anti-FLAG M2-agarose, and Saralasin were from Sigma. [125I]Angiotensin II (2200 Ci/mmol), GTPγS (1250 Ci/mmol), and [γ-32P]GTP (30 Ci/mmol) were from PerkinElmer Life Sciences.myo-[3H]inositol (88 Ci/mmol) was from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Dowex AG 1-X8 anion exchange resin was from Bio-Rad. ScintiVerse was from Fisher. GR/B filter was from Whatman. C57 Bl/Ka-Thy 1.1 strain of mice was bred in the animal facility at Stanford University. Myristylated Gαi1 was expressed in Escherichia coli (JM109) and purified to homogeneity by anion exchange and hydrophobic interaction chromatography as described (35Mumby S.M. Linder M.E. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 237: 254-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Specific activity was 16 nmol/mg of protein as determined by [35S]GTPγS binding. Bone marrow cells were obtained by flushing the tibias and femurs of the C57 Bl/Ka-Thy1.1 strain of mice. Cells were stained with a mixture of rat monoclonal antibodies to various cell surface proteins of mature blood cell lineage: 6B2 (anti-B220), M1/70 (anti-Mac-1), 8C5 (anti-Gr-1), Ter-119 (anti-erythrocyte-specific antigen), KT31.1 (anti-CD3), 53-7.3 (anti-CD5), GK1.5 (anti-CD4), and 53-6.7 (anti-CD8), washed and then incubated with goat anti-rat antibody conjugated with phycoerythrin. After washing, nonspecific sites were blocked with 1 mg of normal rat serum or rat IgG/ml of phosphate-buffered saline. Cells were again washed and then incubated with biotinylated E13–161-7 (anti-Sca-1), fluorescein isothiocyante-conjugated 19XE5 (anti-Thy-1.1), and APC-conjugated 2B8 (anti-c-kit). Washed cells were then incubated with streptavidin-magnetic beads (Miltenyi Biotec) for 10 min and then with avidin-Texas Red (Caltag) for an additional 10 min. Sca-1+cells were enriched with a mini-MACS column (Miltenyi Biotec). The Sca-1+Lin−Thy-1.1loc-kit+long-term hematopoietic stem cells were sorted on a Vantage fluorescence-activated cell sorter (Becton Dickinson) and then resorted to ensure a high degree of purity as described previously (36Morrison S.J. Weissman I. Immunity. 1994; 1: 661-673Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (844) Google Scholar). The long-term hematopoietic stem cells were >98% pure using this approach as demonstrated by repopulation assay (37Spangrude G.J. Brooks D.M. Tumas D.B. Blood. 1995; 85: 1006-1016Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Twenty-eight thousand twice-sorted long-term HSCs were resuspended in 100 μl of Trizol reagent containing 20 μg of glycogen. Total RNA was isolated as described by manufacturer's instructions except the sample was re-extracted with 100 μl of Trizol. Total RNA was precipitated with isopropyl alcohol followed by ethanol and then resuspended in water. cDNAs were synthesized using CapFinder cDNA synthesis kit (CLONTECH) with modifications. There were 7.5 million clones in the original library. To test the quality of the library, plasmid DNA from 150 random clones were isolated and sequenced using ABI 3700 sequencer. Total RNA was isolated from various mouse tissues and human cell lines using Trizol reagent according to the manufacture's instructions. Poly(A)+ RNA was then isolated from total RNA using oligo(dT) paramagnetic beads (Dynal). Two micrograms of poly(A)+ RNA per tissue were separated on a 1% agarose/formaldehyde gel, and transferred to Hybond-XL (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) or Zeta-Probe (Bio-Rad). The membrane was blocked with salmon sperm DNA at 0.1 mg/ml in ExpressHyb buffer (CLONTECH) for 1 h and then hybridized with32P-labeled NotI-EcoRI fragment of RGS18 for 1 h at 68 °C. The membrane was washed twice with 2 × SSC, 0.1% SDS at room temperature and then with 0.1 × SSC, 0.1% SDS at 50 °C, and exposed to film for 2 to 4 days. Human Multiple Tissue Northern blot and Human Immune System Multiple Tissue Northern blot II were obtained fromCLONTECH, and hybridized with32P-labeled 0.5-kb EcoRI fragment of human expressed sequence tag clone za69c05. The probes were stripped and the membranes were reprobed with mouse β-actin cDNA. Genomic DNA was isolated from mouse spleen according to Maniatis et al. (38Maniatis T. Fritsch E.F. Sambrook J. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, New York1989Google Scholar). Fifteen micrograms of genomic DNA was digested with various restriction endonucleases, separated on a 0.7% agarose gel, and then transferred onto Hybond-N+. The membrane was blocked with 100 μg/ml salmon sperm DNA and hybridized with the 32P-labeled 0.5-kb NotI-EcoRI fragment of RGS18 cDNA at 55 °C overnight at 2 × 106 cpm/ml of hybridization buffer (10 × Denhardt's, 6 × SSC, 0.1% SDS). The membrane was washed twice with 2 × SSC, 0.1% SDS at room temperature and then with 0.2 × SSC, 0.1% SDS at 65 °C, and exposed to XAR-5 film (Kodak) at −70 °C for 20 h. Rabbit polyclonal sera were raised against bacterially expressed RGS18 containing the first 202 amino acids, and purified using Protein A column. Various tissues of a BA mouse were homogenized in Buffer B containing 0.2% β-mercaptoethanol with 10 strokes in Potter-Elvehjem tissue grinder, and centrifuged for 10 min in a microcentrifuge at 4 °C. Thirty micrograms of protein were separated on a 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, and Western blot was performed as described (39Park I.K. Soderling T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30464-30469Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) using anti-RGS18 antibody at 5 μg/ml. Long-term and short-term HSCs, common lymphoid progenitors, common myelocyte progenitors, granulocyte macrophage progenitors, and megakaryocyte erythroid progenitors were isolated as described previously (36Morrison S.J. Weissman I. Immunity. 1994; 1: 661-673Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (844) Google Scholar, 40Kondo M. Weissman I.L. Akashi K. Cell. 1997; 91: 661-672Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1664) Google Scholar, 41Akashi K. Traver D. Miyamoto T. Weissman I.L. Nature. 2000; 404: 193-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (1913) Google Scholar). Five thousand cells of each of the above populations were double-sorted on a Vantage fluorescence-activated cell sorter. To ensure the correct populations were isolated to sufficient purity, day 12 spleen colony assays were performed on 100 long-term and short-term HSCs from the above sort. Similarly, common myelocyte progenitors, granulocyte macrophage progenitors, and megakaryocyte erythroid progenitors were functionally assayed in methocellulose cultures according to Ref. 41Akashi K. Traver D. Miyamoto T. Weissman I.L. Nature. 2000; 404: 193-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (1913) Google Scholar. Total RNA was prepared from these fluorescence-activated cell sorter-purified cells using the Qiagen RNeasy miniprep kit. RNA was treated with DNase I to eliminate residual DNA contamination prior to reverse transcription reaction. cDNA was obtained using Superscript II (Life Technologies, Inc.) according the manufacture's recommendations. PCR was performed using 32P-labeled primers and KlenTaq-1 (CLONTECH). Hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase control PCR was performed to normalize the amount of cDNAs to be used in the PCR reaction. Generally, 50 cells worth of cDNA was used to long term and short term-HSCs, 30 cells worth of cDNA for common myelocyte progenitors and granulocyte macrophage progenitors, and 20 cells worth for megakaryocyte erythroid progenitors. After 28 cycles of PCR, one-fifth of the products were run on polyacrylamide gels. Gels were dried and exposed to x-ray films or a PhosphorImager for data acquisition and analyses. RT-PCR of RGS18 from 2 μg of total RNA isolated from thymus was negative (data not shown). Three and a half million 293T cells were transfected with 10 μg of various RGS constructs by the calcium-phosphate method (42Chen C. Okayama H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2745-2752Crossref PubMed Scopus (4821) Google Scholar). Twenty-four hours after transfection, medium was changed, and cells were further grown for another 24 h. Cells were rinsed once with cold phosphate-buffered saline, and resuspended in Buffer A containing 50 mm HEPES, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 mm benzamidine, 5 μg of pepstatin A, TLCK, and TPCK, and 10 μg of leupeptin and soybean trypsin inhibitor per ml. After 15 min on ice, cell lysates were centrifuged in a microcentrifuge for 15 min at 4 °C. The RGS proteins were immunoprecipitated from the supernatant with 20 μl of anti-FLAG M2 affinity gel for 1 h at 4 °C. The immunoprecipitates were washed three times with Buffer A. Jurkat cell extracts (50 million cells per point) were prepared as described (28Beadling C. Druey K.M. Richter G. Kehrl J.H. Smith K.A. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 2677-2682PubMed Google Scholar) using Buffer B (Buffer A plus 1 mm MgCl2 and 0.3 m NaCl). The extracts were treated with 30 μm GDP alone or 30 μm GDP, 30 μm AlCl3, and 0.1 m NaF for 30 min at 30 °C, and then incubated with immunoprecipitated RGS proteins for 1 h at 4 °C. Bound proteins were washed once with Buffer B without Triton X-100, eluted by boiling in 30 μl of SDS sample buffer, and separated on a 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Proteins were transferred electrophoretically to nitrocellulose membrane (Schleicher & Schuell). Western blot was performed using polyclonal antibodies against the α subunits of Gi1+2 (AS7 from PerkinElmer Life Sciences), Gq/11, G12, G13, and Gs or FLAG (Santa Cruz). [γ-32P]GTP (1 μm) was allowed to bind to 50 nm myristylated Gαi1 for 15 min at 30 °C in Buffer E consisting of 50 mm HEPES, pH 8, 5 mm EDTA, 100 mm NaCl, 0.1% Lubrol, and 1 mm dithiothreitol. After lowering the temperature to 4 °C, single turnover GTP hydrolysis was initiated by mixing equal volumes of Gαi1 preloaded with [γ-32P]GTP and Buffer E plus 30 mm MgSO4, 400 μm unlabeled GTP, and FLAG-tagged RGS proteins bound to M2-agarose beads. The hydrolysis reaction was terminated by adding 1 ml of 15% (w/v) charcoal solution containing 50 mmNaH2PO4, pH 2.3, and placing samples on ice at the indicated time points. The charcoal was removed by centrifugation for 20 min at 4,000 × g, and [γ-32P]P i release was assessed by liquid scintillation counting of a 250-μl aliquot of the supernatant in 4 ml of ScintiVerse. Angiotensin binding by whole cells was determined as described previously (43Thompson J.B. Wade S., M. Harrison J.K. Salafranca M.N. Neubig R.R. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1998; 285: 216-222PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were harvested, washed, and resuspended in Buffer C (Opti-MEM, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, and 0.1 mg/ml bacitracin). The binding reaction was initiated by adding [125I]angiotensin II at a final concentration of 100 nm into each cell suspension, and incubating at 37 °C for 1 h. Unbound radioligands were filtered through a GF/B filter and the filters were washed three times with Buffer C. Cell-bound radioligands on filter was quantitated by γ-counting. Nonspecific binding (less than 5% of the total) was determined by adding 1 μm unlabeled Saralasin. Protein assay was performed on each sample according to Bradford (44Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216428) Google Scholar). Total specific binding of angiotensin II was normalized to protein content. Inositol phosphate measurements were carried out as described (43Thompson J.B. Wade S., M. Harrison J.K. Salafranca M.N. Neubig R.R. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1998; 285: 216-222PubMed Google Scholar). Seven hours after transfection, cells were incubated with myo-[3H]inositol (10 μCi/ml) in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium for 24 h at 37 °C. Cells were harvested in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.02% EDTA, washed twice with ice-cold Buffer D (142 mm NaCl, 30 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 5.6 mm KCl, 3.6 mm NaHCO3, 2.2 mmCaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, and 1 mg/mld-glucose), and then resuspended in ice-cold Buffer D containing 60 mm LiCl. The reaction was initiated by mixing 0.25 ml of pre-warmed cell suspension with 0.25 ml of varying concentration of angiotensin II at 37 °C. After 30 min, 0.5 ml of 20% trichloroacetic acid was added and the samples were centrifuged at 4100 × g for 20 min. The supernatant was extracted five times with ethyl ether, neutralized with sodium bicarbonate, and adsorbed to 0.5-ml Dowex AG1-X8 formate resin (50:50 slurry). Resin was washed five times with 2.5 ml of unlabeled 5 mm myo-inositol and inositol phosphates were eluted with 1 ml of 1.2 m ammonium formate, 0.1 m formic acid mixture. The eluates were counted by liquid scintillation counting in 10 ml of ScintiVerse. Released [3H]inositol phosphates were normalized to the amount of [3H]inositol incorporated into cellular lipids. The pellet after centrifugation was resuspended in 0.5 ml of H2O and 1.5 ml of chloroform/methanol, and vortexed vigorously. An additional 0.5 ml of H2O and 1.5 ml of chloroform were added, and a 200 μl-aliquot of the organic phase was counted by liquid scintillation spectrophotometer in 10 ml of ScintiVerse to determine lipid associated radioactivity. HEK293T cells (3.5 × 106) were transfected with 2 μg of pCMV-M1, 2 μg of pCRE/β-gal, and 8 μg of control or FLAG-tagged RGS proteins. After 24 h, cells were serum starved for additional 24 h. Cells were stimulated with 1 mm carbachol for 6 h. Cell extracts were prepared and luciferase activity was measured using a luciferase assay kit (Promega) according to the manufacture's instruction. FLAG-tagged RGS18 was generated by PCR using two primers (5′-CGGGTCATGAGATATGTCACTGGTTTTCTTCTC-3′ and T3 primer) and RGS18 cloned in pBlueScript. The PCR reaction consists of 1 cycle of 2 min at 94 °C, 30 cycles of 30 s at 94 °C/30 s at 60 °C/1 min at 72 °C and 1 cycle of 10 min at 72 °C. The PCR product was cleaned using Qiaspin mini-prep kit (Qiagen). After PCR, the DNA was digested with XbaI and ApaI, and ligated to pcFLAG. Human RGS2 was FLAG-tagged at the C terminus by PCR using primers (5′-TTCAGGATCCAAGAGAGATACCACCATGCAAAGTGCTATGTTCTTG-3′ and 5′-CTTCTCGAGTGTAGCATGAGGCTCTGTGGTG-3′). The PCR product was digested with BamHI and XhoI and ligated to pcFLAG. FLAG-tagged rat RGS4 was provided by Dr. Robert McKenzie (Parke Davis, Ann Arbor, MI). The angiotensin receptor 1a cDNA in pCDM8 has been described previously (43Thompson J.B. Wade S., M. Harrison J.K. Salafranca M.N. Neubig R.R. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1998; 285: 216-222PubMed Google Scholar). pCRE/β-gal was provided by Dr. Roger Cone (Oregon Health Sciences University, Portland, OR), and pCMV-M1 was by Dr. J. Silvio Gutkind (National Health Institute, Bethesda, MD). The hematopoietic cells are constantly replenished by a self-replicating common precursor called the HSC. A large body of data on the biology of these cells has been accumulated. However, due to their rarity (less than 0.01% of the bone marrow cells; Ref 36Morrison S.J. Weissman I. Immunity. 1994; 1: 661-673Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (844) Google Scholar) and the inability to grow these cells in vitro, there is little information regarding the molecular mechanisms that regulate stem cell functions. To better understand long-term self-renewing hematopoietic stem cells on the molecular level, a cDNA library was constructed from small numbers of highly purified long-term self-renewing hematopoietic stem cells. Approximately 150 clones were randomly chosen for sequencing to evaluate the quality of this library. The results of DNA sequencing indicated that the library contained ∼50% previously unknown genes that are not present in the expressed sequence tag or GenBankTM data base (data not shown). One of the unknown clones showed limited homology to RGS (regulator ofG-protein signaling), and this clone was further analyzed. The novel RGS will be referred to as RGS18. Complete sequencing and translation of the cDNA clone indicated that the clone contained the entire coding sequence (Fig.1). The first ATG codon in the sequence is at nucleotide position 187, and conforms to the consensus sequence of Kozak (45Kozak M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1984; 12: 857-872Crossref PubMed Scopus (2382) Google Scholar). The base composition of the entire 1399 base pairs is 65.9% A + T. In the 3′-untranslated region, a single polyadenylation signal sequence, AATAAA, is present at nucleotide position 1122, and three ATTTA or ATTTTA sequence motifs (46Pelletier J. Sonenberg N. Cell. 1985; 40: 515-526Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar) are indicated (Fig. 1). In addition, a TTTTGAT sequence motif followed by an AT-rich sequence is present in the 3′-untranslated region.

https://openalex.org/W2063379302,"Receptor stimulation of nucleotide exchange in a heterotrimeric G protein (αβγ) is the primary event-modulating signaling by G proteins. The molecular mechanisms at the basis of this event and the role of the G protein subunits, especially the βγ complex, in receptor activation are unclear. In a reconstituted system, a purified muscarinic receptor, M2, activates G protein heterotrimers αi2β1γ5 and αi2β1γ7 with equal efficacy. However, when the α subunit type is substituted with αo, αoβ1γ7 shows a 100% increase in M2-stimulated GTP hydrolysis compared with αoβ1γ5. Using a sensitive assay based on βγ complex stimulation of phospholipase C activity, we show that both β1γ5 and β1γ7 form heterotrimers equally well with αo and αi. These results indicate that the γ subunit interaction with a receptor is critical for modulating nucleotide exchange and is influenced by the subunit-type composition of the heterotrimer.

Both α and βγ subunits are required for interaction with receptor (1Shinozawa T. Uchida S. Martin E. Cafiso D. Hubbell W. Bitensky M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chem. 1983; 258: 10495-10502Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The G protein α subunit has been demonstrated to interact with and selectively couple to receptors, especially muscarinic receptors (4Kostenis E. Zeng F.Y. Wess J. Life Sci. 1999; 64: 355-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The role of the βγ complex in interaction with the receptor is, however, less well understood. There is evidence for interaction of the G protein γ subunit with receptors (5Gautam N. Downes G.B. Yan K. Kisselev O. Cell. Signal. 1998; 10: 447-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). There are also indications for specificity in this interaction. Results from experiments in pituitary GH3 cells using antisense oligonucleotides specific to different β or γ subunit types indicated that signaling stimulated by different receptors can be specifically inhibited (6Kleuss C. Scherubl H. Hescheler J. Schultz G. Wittig B. Science. 1993; 259: 832-834Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). The γ1 subunit type allowed effective coupling of Gt with rhodopsin in contrast to γ2 and γ3 (7Kisselev O. Gautam N. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24519-24522Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In superior cervical ganglion (SCG)1 neurons peptides specific to the γ5 subunit type disrupted signaling from the M2/M4 muscarinic receptors, whereas peptides specific to γ7 and γ12 had no effect (8Azpiazu I. Cruzblanca H. Li P. Linder M. Zhuo M. Gautam N. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35305-35308Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Because this implied that the M2 muscarinic receptor selectively interacts with a G protein containing γ5 but not γ7, we tested the ability of the M2 receptor to activate G proteins containing these two subunits. Earlier studies addressing the question of G protein specificity for receptors used whole cells or crude membranes from cells. Experiments with intact cells do not definitively allow identification of the site at which the disruption in signaling occurs. Crude membranes contain endogenous G proteins, receptors, and other components that may affect analysis of specificity in receptor-G protein interactions. To more rigorously and directly examine the effect of G protein subunit constitution on receptor-G protein coupling, we reconstituted a purified muscarinic receptor, M2, in lipids and measured its ability to activate G proteins containing different γ subunits. The M2 receptor is known to couple to members of the Gi/o family but not Gq (9Nathanson N.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 6245-6247Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). To examine whether the subunit-type constitution of a heterotrimer influenced receptor interaction we tested different combinations of the α and γ subunit types αoβγ5, αoβ1γ7, αi2β1γ5, and αi2β1γ7. Recombinant G protein subunits were purified from insect cells, and heterotrimers constituting different combinations of α and γ subunits were assembled. We measured M2-stimulated GTPγS binding and GTPase activity using defined G protein heterotrimers. GTPγS binding assays were performed at a ratio of the G protein α subunit to receptor of 100:1 (1 nm receptor). Because subtle differences in receptor activation could be missed under these conditions, we developed GTPase assays to measure receptor activation of a G protein at a ratio of G protein to receptor approaching 1:1 (1 nm receptor). These assays detected consistent and significant differences in the ability of the M2 receptor to activate αoβ1γ5 compared with αoβ1γ7. In contrast, when the α subunit type was substituted with αi2 there was no difference in receptor-stimulated GTPase activity between αi2β1γ5 and αi2β1γ7. The difference in receptor-stimulated activity between αoβ1γ5 and αoβ1γ7 could be due to differential heterotrimer formation between αo and these βγ complexes. To test this possibility we developed a novel phospholipase C (PLC)-based assay to measure heterotrimer formation. This assay indicated that the differences in GTPase activity between αoβγ5 and αoβγ7 arose as a result of differential receptor coupling rather than differential heterotrimer formation. G protein βγ subunits were expressed in the baculovirus Sf9 cell system. The purification was essentially performed according to the procedures described before (10Kozasa T. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1734-1741Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). The purity and quantity of these βγ proteins were assessed by separating by SDS gel electrophoresis, staining with Coomassie Blue, scanning with a laser densitometer, and comparing with protein standards. G proteins αo and αi2 were purified from Escherichia coliusing published methods (11Linder M.E. Kleuss C. Mumby S.M. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 250: 314-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). RGS4 was a gift from Dr. M. Linder, Washington University. The βγ-stimulated PLC assay was performed using a procedure as stated previously (12Romoser V. Ball R. Smrcka A.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25071-25078Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). His-tagged M2 was expressed in Sf9 cells and purified using a CoCl2 affinity column (13Hayashi M.K. Haga T. J. Biochem. ( Tokyo ). 1996; 120: 1232-1238Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Purified M2 was reconstituted into brain lipids (Folch type VII; Sigma) and characterized by binding to antagonist, [3H]N-[3H]methylscopolamine (NMS). The receptor (50 pm) was incubated with various concentrations of [3H]NMS at room temperature for 60 min in a binding buffer containing 20 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.4) and 10 mm MgCl2. The reactions were terminated by filtration through Whatman GF/B membranes, and the filters were then washed with ice-cold binding buffer before counting the radioactivity. The formation of heterotrimeric Go protein, the M2-G protein complex, GTPγS binding, and GTP hydrolysis assays are described in the legends for Figs. 2 and3.Figure 2M2-stimulated GTPγS binding to Go.

Reconstituted M2 was then added and incubated for an additional 30 min. The M2-G protein complex was incubated at room temperature with 0.2 μm [35S]GTPγS and carbachol or water (control). In A, incubation was performed at different time points, whereas reactions were carried out for a fixed time (4 min) inB and C. The samples were filtered through nitrocellulose membranes, and bound [35S]GTPγS was detected by scintillation counting. The results are representative of three independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Figure 3M2-stimulated GTP hydrolysis by Go and Gi containing γ5 and γ7.

B, αi2β1γ5 and αi2β1γ7 have the same level of M2-stimulated GTPase activity. The formation of heterotrimer was as in the GTPγS binding assay. Reconstituted M2 and RGS4 proteins were incubated with heterotrimeric Go in ice for 30 min. The receptor-G protein complex was then mixed with carbachol or water before [γ-32P]GTP was added to initiate the reaction at 25 °C. A typical reaction mixture contained differing concentrations of G protein, 1 nm receptor, 0.1 μm RGS4, 0.2 μm [γ-32P]GTP, 5 μm GDP, and 1 mm carbachol in a buffer of 20 mm Hepes (pH 8.0), 100 mm NaCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, and 0.5 mg/ml BSA. Activity measured in the presence of 200 μm GTP (1000 times more than radiolabeled GTP) served as a control for nonspecific activity. Aliquots were taken at indicated time points and quenched in 0.5 ml of ice-cold buffer containing 5% activated charcoal and 50 mmK3PO4.

Experiments have been repeated at least five times, and representative data are shown.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To form the G protein heterotrimer, 360 nm βγ complex was initially incubated with increasing concentrations of α subunit in ice for 30 min to obtain a wide range of βγ:α ratios in a buffer containing 20 mm Hepes (pH 8.0), 100 mm NaCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, and 0.5 mg/ml BSA. This mixture was then diluted 10-fold in a buffer containing 50 mm Hepes (pH 7.2), 3 mm EGTA, 1 mm EDTA, 5 mmMgCl2, 100 mm NaCl, and 1 mm DTT. 10 μl of these diluted samples containing βγ and various concentrations of α subunit was then added to 50 μl of PLC reaction buffer containing [3H]PIP2 substrate and PLC β3 for determining enzyme activity as described above. βγ complexes purified as described above were over 95% pure (Fig. 1 A). When PLC β3 isozyme stimulation by β1γ5 or β1γ7 complexes was measured, the similar levels of activation of PLC by both βγ complexes indicated that the functional proportion of each βγ complex was the same (Fig. 1 B). In addition, we ensured that the concentration of detergent in the purified β1γ5 and β1γ7 samples were identical, using thin layer chromatography and detergents at various concentrations as standards (data not shown). His-M2 has been shown to possess similar properties to native M2 after reconstitution into lipids (13Hayashi M.K. Haga T. J. Biochem. ( Tokyo ). 1996; 120: 1232-1238Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). His-M2 receptor was purified as described earlier. The purified M2 was ∼90% pure as assessed by the methods used to quantify the G protein subunits. Reconstituted M2 had aKd for an antagonist, NMS, similar to native M2 (14Buckley N.J. Bonner T.I. Buckley C.M. Brann M.R. Mol. Pharmacol. 1989; 35: 469-476PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 1 C). To allow for accurate titration of various concentrations of G protein subunits with purified receptor, we developed a system in which receptor alone was first reconstituted into lipids, quantified, and then assayed for its ability to activate varying concentrations of added G protein (Fig. 2, seelegend). αo was assayed in the presence of two different βγ complexes, β1γ5 and β1γ7. The reconstituted M2 efficiently activates αo in a βγ-dependent manner (Fig. 2 A). At an α:βγ:M2 ratio of 100:10:1 with 1 nm M2, no differences were noted in the ability of M2 to activate αoβ1γ5 and αoβ1γ7 (Fig. 2 A). It was possible that at lower concentrations of αo and an α:M2 ratio closer to 1:1, subtle differences would be detected. However, GTPγS binding at lower concentrations of αo (e.g. 10 nm) was not sufficiently above background for use in these assays. Given this constraint, it was possible only to examine the effect of varying concentrations of βγ complex, as well as agonist, on M2-stimulated GTPγS binding to αoβ1γ5 and αoβ1γ7. These assays did not reveal any differences between the heterotrimers (Fig. 2, B and C). βγ complex concentrations below 10 nm could not be examined because of the low activity detected above background. The M2-promoted GTPγS binding assay could mask differential activation of heterotrimers containing different γ subunits for the following two related reasons: (i) the excess of α subunit relative to receptor (100:1) present in the GTPγS assay and (ii) the lack of amplification in the signal, because an α subunit bound to the nonhydrolyzable GTPγS analog undergoes only one cycle of activation unlike GTP-bound α subunit. We therefore examined M2-activated GTP hydrolysis by defined Go/i protein heterotrimers. M2 stimulation with carbachol increased GTPase activity 5–10-fold over the activity in the absence of agonist. The addition of RGS4, a GTPase-activating protein for the Go/i family (15Berman D.M. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1269-1272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar), promoted an additional 10-fold increase in GTPase activity (data not shown). This increase in sensitivity allowed us to measure G protein activation at ratios of α to receptor close to 1:1 with a constant concentration of 1 nm M2. When defined heterotrimers were assayed under these conditions, the receptor-stimulated GTPase activity of αoβ1γ7 was 100% higher than αoβ1γ5 (see Fig. 3 Aand Table I). This difference was seen at all G protein concentrations tested (Table I). The difference was also seen with β1γ5 and β1γ7 preparations purified independently indicating that the difference was not because of contaminants in one particular preparation of the βγ complexes. Statistical analysis using the Student's t test showed that the differences are significant (p < 0.05). To test whether the α subunit type in the heterotrimer influenced this differential activity, we compared the receptor-stimulated GTPase activity of αi2β1γ5 and αi2β1γ7. Surprisingly, there was no difference in GTPase activity between the two heterotrimers at various ratios of Gi2:M2 (see Fig. 3 B and Table I).Table IM2-promoted GTPase activity of Go and Gi containing γ5 and γ7CompositionGTPase activity 1-aGTPase activity was determined as described before and expressed as nmPi/min ± S.E.

Open table in a new tab Formation of the heterotrimer is essential for G protein interaction with a receptor (3Fung B.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 10495-10502Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 2). One explanation for the difference in the receptor-stimulated GTPase activity between αoβ1γ5 and αoβ1γ7 could be differential efficacy of heterotrimer formation between β1γ5 and β1γ7 with αo. To test this possibility, we developed an assay for measuring G protein heterotrimer formation. Thus far, efficacy of heterotrimer formation has been measured using pertussis toxin-mediated ADP ribosylation of the α subunit, which is enhanced by the βγ complex. However, the mechanistic basis for βγ complex requirement in this assay is unclear. Also, the enhancement by the βγ complex is catalytic and requires relatively high concentrations of the subunits (>1 μm) inappropriate for measuring heterotrimer formation under conditions identical to the GTPase assays used here (<10 nm subunits). To overcome these problems we developed an alternative approach. This approach was based on the idea that the βγ complex contains overlapping binding sites for both the α subunit and PLC β3 (16Ford C.E. Skiba N.P. Bae H. Daaka Y. Reuveny E. Shekter L.R. Rosal R. Weng G. Yang C.S. Iyengar R. Miller R.J. Jan L.Y. Lefkowitz R.J. Hamm H.E. Science. 1998; 280: 1271-1274Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar). Thus, binding of αi/o to βγ complex would prevent βγ interaction with PLC β3. Heterotrimer formation should thus lead to inhibition of βγ-stimulated PLC activity. As shown in Fig. 4, this assay is highly sensitive. βγ-stimulated PLC activity is inhibited by the addition of αo or αi subunit. Inhibition is dependent on the concentration of α subunit added. The assay is sensitive in the nmrange of α and βγ subunits. Both β1γ5 and β1γ7 form a heterotrimer with αo and αi2 equally well (Fig. 4, A andB). Indications that the γ subunits may impart specificity to receptor-G protein interaction have come from the analysis of different receptors (7Kisselev O. Gautam N. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24519-24522Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Azpiazu I. Cruzblanca H. Li P. Linder M. Zhuo M. Gautam N. J. Biol.

In studies with the muscarinic receptor, a peptide specific to the C terminus of the γ5 subunit was shown to inhibit coupling of G protein to the M2 receptor and also disrupt a muscarinic receptor (M2/M4)-mediated signaling pathway in SCG neurons (8Azpiazu I. Cruzblanca H. Li P. Linder M. Zhuo M. Gautam N. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35305-35308Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). In comparison, a homologous peptide from γ7 was ineffective indicating that the γ5 subunit interacted with the M2/M4 class of receptors, whereas γ7 did not. To test whether the results of the peptide activity in intact cells could be reproduced in a reconstituted system, we expressed, purified, and assayed the ability of G proteins containing the same γ subunit types to functionally couple to the purified M2 muscarinic receptor. By using a sensitive functional assay we sought to elucidate the underlying mechanistic bases for any differences in coupling. The results show a clear difference in the ability of αo heterotrimers containing γ5 or γ7 to be activated by M2 receptors. αoβ1γ7 has a distinctly higher GTP hydrolysis rate compared with αoβ1γ5. A simple interpretation of this would be that αoβ1γ7 couples more efficiently with M2 than αoβ1γ5. However, we favor an alternative interpretation in the context of earlier experiments, which indicate that the C terminus of the γ5 subunit more effectively interacts with M2 than γ7 (8Azpiazu I. Cruzblanca H. Li P. Linder M. Zhuo M. Gautam N. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35305-35308Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Because β1γ5 and β1γ7 interact equally well with αo, the difference in GTPase activity has to arise from a difference in the rate of receptor-stimulated nucleotide exchange between the two heterotrimers. It is likely that the γ5 subunit interacts appropriately with the M2 receptor, whereas γ7 does not, and the increased GTPase activity is a consequence of more rapid “leaky” nucleotide exchange from the resulting inappropriate configuration of the αo subunit with reference to the β1γ7 complex. This interpretation is consistent with a previous conclusion that the βγ complex plays a direct or indirect role at the receptor surface in controlling nucleotide exchange in the α subunit (19Onrust R. Herzmark P. Chi P. Garcia P.D. Lichtarge O. Kingsley C. Bourne H.R. Science. 1997; 275: 381-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Strikingly, the difference seen between αoβ1γ7 and αoβ1γ5 disappears when αo is substituted with αi2. One possibility is that αi2 interacts with a different site on the receptor compared with αo thus changing the overall conformation of the G protein heterotrimer at the receptor surface. There are evidences from the analyses of different receptors for such differential interaction with G protein subtypes (20Gudermann T. Schoneberg T. Schultz G. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1997; 20: 399-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). The distinctly differential rate of M2-induced Go and Gi GTPase rates (Fig. 3), as well as GTPγS binding (21Parker E.M. Kameyama K. Higashijima T. Ross E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 519-527Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), are also consistent with this scenario. Regardless of the mechanism, this result indicates that the heterotrimer composition influences receptor-stimulated nucleotide exchange. Because the G protein subunits are families of proteins it has been thought that particular combinations of α and βγ subtypes may differentially regulate signaling (22Simon M.I. Strathmann M.P. Gautam N. Science. 1991; 252: 802-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (1585) Google Scholar). The results here indicate that different α subunit and γ subunit types, through specific interactions with a receptor, can coordinately modulate receptor-stimulated nucleotide exchange resulting in differential signaling kinetics.

It provides nutrients to photoreceptor cells and contains melanin pigments that absorb excess light radiation. RPE cells are polarized: the basolateral membrane side encounters choroidal circulation, whereas the apical microvillus membrane side faces photoreceptors. These cells are indispensable for the regeneration of 11-cis-retinal, the visual chromophore, and carry out the phagocytosis and degradation of photoreceptor outer segment discs undergoing circadian shedding (1Bok D.

The RPE also plays a critical role in infectious and inflammatory diseases affecting the retina (4Rao N.A. Wu G.S. Prog. Retin. Eye Res. 2000; 19: 41-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), and macular degeneration, a major visual system disorder associated with aging, has been attributed to RPE dysfunction (5Young R.W.

ARPE-19 cells exhibit a distinctly epithelial morphology, noticeable pigmentation, and polarized distribution of cell-surface markers (8Dunn K.C. Aotaki-Keen A.E. Putkey F.R. Hjelmeland L.M. Exp.

To study gene expression in the RPE, we have constructed a cDNA library with poly(A)+ RNA preparations isolated from ARPE-19 cells. A cDNA clone identified during the initial characterization of this library was found to represent a novel human gene. We have further characterized this gene and shown that its expression is regulated by retinoic acid. We have also characterized an ortholog of this gene from mouse, and its expression, when analyzed byin situ hybridization, appears to be developmentally regulated. Human retinal pigment epithelial cells (ARPE-19), a rapidly growing human RPE cell line, were grown at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/nutrient mixture F-12 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin as described previously (12Chancy C.D. Kekuda R. Huang W. Prasad P.D. Kuhnel J.M. Sirotnak F.M. Roon P. Ganapathy V. Smith S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20676-20684Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Cells were grown on 100-mm culture dishes and treated with all-trans-retinoic acid when they were 60–80% confluent. Total RNA was isolated from ARPE-19 cells using RNAzol B (Tel-Test, Inc., Friendswood, TX). Poly(A)+ RNA fractions were separated using oligo(dT)-cellulose and used for cDNA synthesis and library construction using a ZAP Express cDNA synthesis kit and ZAP Express cDNA Gigapack III Gold cloning kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Poly(A)+ RNA preparations from ARPE-19 cells or mouse testis were used for reverse transcriptase-PCR. The RNA preparations were reverse-transcribed with an oligo(dT) primer, and the first strand cDNA preparations were used as template for PCR. Rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) was performed using 5′-and 3′-RACE systems obtained from Life Technologies, Inc. (14Frohman M.A. Dush M.K. Martin G.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 8998-9002Crossref PubMed Scopus (4329) Google Scholar). Sequencing of cDNA clones and PCR amplification products was performed on an Applied Biosystems 370A DNA sequencer using the Taq dideoxy termination sequencing kit (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). DNA and protein sequences were analyzed using the BLAST similarity search program supported by NCBI. Multiple sequence alignment was performed using the ClustalW program (15Thompson J.D. Higgins D.G. Gibson T.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4673-4680Crossref PubMed Scopus (55389) Google Scholar). The Paircoil program was employed for predicting coiled-coil regions (16Berger B. Wilson D.B. Wolf E. Tonchev T. Milla M. Kim P.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8259-8263Crossref PubMed Scopus (592) Google Scholar). ExPASy proteomic tools were used for analyzing protein physicochemical properties. A human genomic P1 library was screened by PCR using primers 5′-TGACCCAGCTCAAACAAC and 5′-ACCATTGCATCAGTCATAGCAGC, designed from the NORPEGcDNA sequence (Genome Systems, Inc., St. Louis, MO). The identity of one of the P1 clones thus obtained was verified by PCR using different sets of primers and by sequencing some of the amplification products. Purified DNA from this clone was labeled with digoxigenin-dUTP by nick translation and used as a probe for in situ hybridization. The labeled probe was combined with sheared human DNA and hybridized to metaphase chromosomes derived from phytohemagglutinin-stimulated peripheral blood lymphocytes in a solution containing 50% formamide, 10% dextran sulfate, and 2× SSC. Specific hybridization signals were detected by incubating the hybridized slides in fluorescein-conjugated anti-digoxigenin antibodies, followed by counterstaining with 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole. RNA preparations were subjected to agarose gel electrophoresis in the presence of formaldehyde, transferred to a Nytran membrane (Schleicher & Schüll), and hybridized with a cDNA probe labeled with 32P (17Feinberg A.P. Vogelstein B. Anal. Biochem. 1983; 132: 6-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (16646) Google Scholar). Hybridization was carried out using QuickHyb hybridization solution (Stratagene) containing labeled probe (∼2 × 106cpm/ml) and denatured salmon sperm DNA (0.1 mg/ml) at 68 °C for 1 h. The blots were then washed under stringent conditions and exposed to Kodak XAR film or analyzed using a PhosphorImager (STORM 860, Molecular Dynamics, Inc., Sunnyvale, CA). Antibodies were produced against two synthetic peptides designed from the predicted sequences of the human and mouse NORPEG proteins. The first peptide (NORPEG-28, CENGDAEKVASLLGKKGAS) contained a cysteine residue at the N terminus in addition to amino acids 28–45 of the human or mouse NORPEG protein. The second peptide (NORPEG-961, DVQKVLKQILTMCKNQSQKK) contained amino acids 961–980 of the human or amino acids 960–979 of the mouse NORPEG protein. The peptides were synthesized, purified to >90% by high pressure liquid chromatography, conjugated to keyhole limpet hemocyanin, and used for immunization of rabbits (Bethyl Laboratories, Inc., Montgomery, TX). The antisera (anti-NORPEG-28 and anti-NORPEG-961) were purified using immunoaffinity columns prepared with peptides linked to agarose using cyanogen bromide. The affinity-purified antibody preparations were passed over keyhole limpet hemocyanin immunosorbent to remove keyhole limpet hemocyanin immunoreactivity. Poly(A)+ RNA preparations isolated from ARPE-19 cells were reverse-transcribed with 5′-AGAGCTCTCCTGTGCTGA (corresponding to bp 3465 to 3448 of NORPEG cDNA) as a primer using Superscript II reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies, Inc.). The reaction mixture was treated with RNase, and an aliquot was subjected to PCR with high fidelity Pfu Turbo DNA polymerase (Stratagene) employing 5′-GTGGAGCAGCCAGCTGGGTC and 5′-CATCAGGACCAGACCTC as sense and antisense primers, respectively. The amplification product, corresponding to bp 16–3327 ofNORPEG cDNA, was cloned into the pCR-Blunt vector (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). This plasmid DNA was used as a template for PCR with primers 5′-cttgcggccgcCATGAAGAGCTTGAAAGCG and 5′-agctggatccCTTCTTTTGAGACTGGTTTT. These primers contained the restriction enzyme sites (underlined) NotI andBamHI, respectively (extra nucleotides added to create restriction sites are shown in lowercase letters). Pfu Turbo DNA polymerase was used as the enzyme. The PCR product, containing bp 111–3051 of NORPEG cDNA, was digested with restriction enzymes and cloned into the NotI and BamHI sites of the pFLAG-CMV-2 expression vector (Sigma). The fusion protein containing the FLAG epitope at the N terminus was transiently expressed in COS-7 cells (CRL-1651, American Type Culture Collection). The cells were transfected with plasmid DNA using LipofectAMINE reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.) and allowed to grow for 72 h. The extracts prepared from transfected cells were analyzed for expressed FLAG fusion protein by Western blotting using anti-FLAG M2 monoclonal antibody (Sigma) or antibody preparations against NORPEG. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was carried out using NUPAGE 4–12% BisTris gels and MOPS/SDS running buffer (Novex, San Diego, CA), and then the protein bands from the gels were electroblotted onto nitrocellulose membranes. The WesternBreeze chromogenic immunodetection system (Novex), which utilizes alkaline phosphatase-conjugated secondary antibody, was used for detecting immunoreactivity. The expression of FLAG fusion protein was also analyzed by immunofluorescence microscopy. COS-7 cells were grown to 60–80% confluence on 8-well glass chamber slides (Nalge Nunc, Naperville, IL) and transfected with the NORPEG construct using LipofectAMINE reagent as described above. The cells were then allowed to grow for 48 h before fixing for 5 min in 1:1 methanol/acetone mixture precooled to −20 °C. The slides were incubated in the presence of anti-FLAG M2 or anti-NORPEG-28 antibody for 1 h at 37 °C. Immunoreactivity was detected using the appropriate fluorescein-conjugated secondary antibody. The ARPE-19 cells were grown on Nunc 8-well chamber slides coated with laminin and were allowed to differentiate for at least 4 weeks (12Chancy C.D. Kekuda R. Huang W. Prasad P.D. Kuhnel J.M.

The cells were fixed with ice-cold methanol and blocked with blocking solution (Novex) for 1 h at room temperature. Cells were incubated with anti-NORPEG-28 antibody preparations for 3 h in a humidified chamber at room temperature and then were washed in antibody wash solution (Novex). Incubation with 0.1% pre-bleed serum or with buffer only served as a negative control. After rinsing, all samples were incubated overnight at 4 °C with fluorescein-conjugated AffiniPure goat anti-rabbit IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc., West Grove, PA) at a dilution of 1:100. Cells were optically sectioned (z series) using a Nikon Diaphot 200 laser scanning confocal imaging system (Molecular Dynamics, Inc.). Images were analyzed using the Image Display 3.2 software package (Silicon Graphics, Mountain View, CA). To examine the expression of the NORPEG protein, testes and eyes from 5–6-week-old albino (ICR) mice were enucleated, frozen immediately in Tissue-Tek OCT (Miles Laboratories, Elkhart, IN), and sectioned at 10-μm thickness. Immediately before the experiment, sections were fixed in ice-cold acetone for 5 min. Endogenous peroxidase activity was quenched by incubating the sections for 15 min with the peroxidase solution. Sections were washed in phosphate-buffered saline and blocked for 1 h with blocking solution. Sections were incubated with anti-NORPEG-28 or anti-NORPEG-961 antibody preparations. Immunoreactivity was detected by peroxidase staining using reagents from Dako Corp. (Carpinteria, CA). In situ hybridization was performed by Phylogeny Inc. following the procedure of Lyonset al. (18Lyons G.E. Schiaffino S. Sassoon D. Barton P. Buckingham M. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 2427-2436Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar) as described before (19Hu M.C.T. Wang Y.P. Mikhail A. Qiu W.R. Tan T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7095-7102Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The cRNA probes were prepared from linearized cDNA templates (bp 2232–2619 region of mouse Norpeg cDNA cloned into the pBluescript II KS+ vector) using an in vitro transcription kit (Ambion Inc.) and 35S-UTP (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and subjected to alkali hydrolysis to give a mean size of 70 bases. Hybridization was carried out at 52 °C in a solution containing 50% deionized formamide, 0.3 m NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 5 mm EDTA, 10 mm NaPO4, dextran sulfate, 1× Denhardt's solution, 50 μg/ml total yeast RNA, and ∼60,000 cpm/μl 35S-labeled cRNA probes (antisense or sense). The sections were then subjected to stringent washing at 65 °C in 50% formamide, 2× SSC, and 10 mmdithiothreitol. Following washing and RNase A treatment, the slides were dehydrated, dipped in Kodak NTB-2 nuclear track emulsion, and exposed for 2–3 weeks in light-tight boxes with desiccant at 4 °C. Photographic development was carried out using Kodak D-19. The slides were counterstained lightly with toluidine blue and analyzed using both the light- and dark-field optics of a Ziess Axiophot microscope. A cDNA library was constructed using poly(A)+ RNA fractions isolated from the human RPE cell line ARPE-19. During the characterization of this library, we found a cDNA clone whose sequence did not show any similarity to published sequences at the time of its isolation. The complete cDNA sequence for this novel gene was obtained using 5′- and 3′-RACE techniques and by reverse transcriptase-PCR. The 4925-bp cDNA sequence for the gene, which we termed NORPEG (novelretinal pigment epithelial cellgene; GenBankTM/EBI accession number AF155135), shows an open reading frame with an initiation codon at position 112 and a stop codon (TAA) at position 3052, thus leaving a long 3′-untranslated region. It should be noted that a cDNA clone (mRNA for the KIAA1334 protein; GenBankTM/EBI accession number AB037755) as well as a partial cDNA clone (DKFZp564G013; GenBankTM/EBI accession number AL050011) matching the sequence reported here recently appeared in the data base. We have also obtained the cDNA sequence for an ortholog ofNORPEG that is expressed in mouse testis employing reverse transcriptase-PCR and RACE techniques. The mouse NorpegcDNA (GenBankTM/EBI accession number AF274866) is 4879 bp long and contains an open reading frame with an initiation codon at bp 221 and a stop codon (TAA) at position 3158. The mouseNorpeg cDNA showed 81% sequence identity to the humanNORPEG cDNA. The predicted human and mouse NORPEG proteins contain 980 and 979 amino acid residues, respectively (Fig.1 A). They show 84% identity and 91% similarity. The human NORPEG protein is predicted to have a molecular mass of 110,042 Da, a pI of 5.83, and six potentialN-glycosylation sites. In comparison, the mouse homolog is predicted to have a molecular mass of 108,852 Da, a pI of 5.88, and four potential N-glycosylation sites. The domain organization of the NORPEG protein is shown in Fig. 1 B. Using BLAST analysis, the N-terminal regions of both human and mouse NORPEG protein sequences were found to be similar to several ankyrin repeat-containing proteins. Six ankyrin repeats spanning amino acids 18–240 were identified by ProfileScan for the human NORPEG protein. Alignment of the six repeats with the consensus sequence for the ankyrin motif is shown in Fig. 1 C. In mouse, the six ankyrin repeats spanned amino acids 20–242. BLAST analysis also showed that a large segment of both the human and mouse NORPEG proteins (amino acids 400–900) shares similarity with coiled-coil helical domains of several proteins, including restin (Reed-Steinberg cell-expressed intermediate filament-associated protein), myosin heavy chain, and golgin-245 (20Fritzler M.J.

Further analysis indicated 11 coiled-coils between amino acids 341 and 947 for the human NORPEG protein (Fig. 1 D). In comparison, the mouse NORPEG protein contains 10 coiled-coils between amino acids 341 and 946 (data not shown). The chromosomal localization of the humanNORPEG gene was determined by PCR screening of a chromosome mapping panel (NIGMS Human Genetic Mutant Cell Repository at the Coriell Institute for Medical Research, Camden, NJ) with oligonucleotides 5′-TGACCCAGCTCAAACAAC and 5′-ACCATTGCATCAGTCATAGCAGC. These primers spanned the NORPEG cDNA sequence region of bp 2249–2462. A 214-bp amplification product, whose identity was verified by DNA sequencing, was observed when a DNA preparation from a chromosome 5 monochromosomal somatic cell hybrid was used as the template. Further confirmation of the localization of theNORPEG gene to human chromosome 5 was obtained by fluorescence in situ hybridization. The DNA preparation obtained from a genomic P1 clone containing the NORPEG gene was used as the probe. The probe hybridized to the short arm of chromosome 5 (Fig. 2 A). The localization was further verified by co-hybridizing this probe with a probe specific for the cri-du-chat locus, which has been previously been mapped to the long arm, 5q22 (Fig. 2 B). Measurements of 10 hybridized chromosomes showed that theNORPEG gene is located 29% of the distance from the centromere to the telomere of chromosome arm 5p; this is an area corresponding to band 5p13.2–13.3 (Fig. 2 C). Also in support of this localization, several genomic clones designated as chromosome 5 clones that appeared recently in the data base (high throughput genomic sequencing) were found to contain segments of DNA sequences of NORPEG cDNA. Comparison of the cDNA sequence of the NORPEG gene with genomic clone sequences (AC008950, AC016602, AC025269, AC025754, AC025769, AC026801, AC055815, and AC008690) allowed us to determine the exon/intron boundaries in this gene. As illustrated in Fig. 2 D, the NORPEGgene contains 18 exons and spans >120 kb. RNA preparations obtained from ARPE-19 cells were analyzed by Northern blotting using a cDNA probe for the NORPEG gene. As shown in Fig.3 A, a strong signal was observed at ∼5 kb, with a weak signal at ∼3 kb. Hybridization of a human tissue RNA blot with this probe showed that the gene is also highly expressed in placenta and testis (data not shown). Therefore, RNA preparations from these two sources were also subjected to Northern blot analysis (Fig. 3 A). Like the ARPE-19 cells, placenta showed a highly intense signal at ∼5 kb, with a weak signal at ∼3 kb. Interestingly, a reverse trend was observed in testis; the intense signal was at ∼3 kb, and the weak signal was at ∼5 kb. These two distinct mRNA species were subjected to further analysis. Blots containing RNA preparations from ARPE-19 cells and testis were analyzed with probes representing various segments of the NORPEGcDNA. Several probes generated from bp 1–3000 of the cDNA hybridized with both the ∼5- and ∼3-kb messages, whereas those generated from the bp 3124–4774 region hybridized only with the ∼5-kb message. As shown in Fig. 3 B, a probe representing the bp 2559–3000 region hybridized with both the ∼5- and ∼3-kb messages, whereas a probe representing the bp 3124–3666 region hybridized only with the ∼5-kb message. Thus, it appears that the ∼3-kb message lacks most of the long 3′-untranslated region present in the ∼5-kb message. NORPEG mRNA was also found to be highly expressed in several human cancer cell lines (Fig.3 C). NORPEG mRNA expression in ARPE-19 cells was induced by all-trans-retinoic acid (Fig. 3 D). The ∼5-kb transcript showed a concentration-dependent increase when the cells were treated with retinoic acid for 48 h. A >5-fold induction of this transcript was detected in the presence of 1 μm all-trans-retinoic acid. The ∼3-kb transcript, due to its low abundance in ARPE-19 cells, is not quite visible in the autoradiogram presented. This is especially true in the case of untreated cells. However, signal for the shorter transcript is clearly noticeable in lanes representing RNA samples from cells treated with ≥0.5 μm retinoic acid. Thus, it appears that the ∼3-kb transcript is also induced by this treatment. The entire coding region of the humanNORPEG cDNA was cloned into an N-terminal FLAG expression vector, and the FLAG fusion protein was transiently expressed in COS-7 cells. Immunofluorescence microscopic analysis of these cells using an anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody showed intense immunoreactivity in the cytoplasm (Fig.4). A similar staining pattern was also observed when anti-NORPEG-28 antibody was used as the primary antibody. The expressed NORPEG protein was also detected on a Western blot as an ∼110-kDa band using an anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody preparation (Fig. 4 E). The immunoreactivity was associated with the pellet fraction when the cell homogenate was centrifuged. Treatment of the resulting pellet with Triton X-100 and 1.5 m KCl did not result in the solubilization of the ∼110-kDa protein. The expressed protein was analyzed using antibody preparations against peptide sequences from the N-terminal (amino acids 28–45) as well as C-terminal (amino acids 961–980) regions of the NORPEG protein. Both of these antibody preparations (anti-NORPEG-28 and anti-NORPEG-961) were found to recognize the ∼110-kDa band (Fig. 4, F andG). The preimmune serum, as expected, did not show any reactivity toward this band (data not shown). Differentiated ARPE-19 cells are known to exhibit polarized distribution of certain proteins (10Dunn K.C. Marmorstein A.D. Bonilha V.L. Rodriguez-Boulan E. Giordano F. Hjelmeland L.M. Invest.

ARPE-19 cells were allowed to differentiate and then immunostained using anti-NORPEG-28 antibody and fluorescein-conjugated secondary antibody. The immunostained cells were subjected to laser scanning confocal microscopic analysis. The cells were optically sectioned in a horizontal and vertical plane. The distribution of immunoreactivity was throughout the cytoplasm of the ARPE-19 cells (Fig.5). The x-y scans (horizontal optical sections) revealed a threadlike distribution of the NORPEG protein throughout the cytoplasm. The x-zscans (vertical optical sections) showed distribution throughout the cells, indicating that expression is not limited to the apical or basal membranes of the cells. Again, the vertical scans of the cells revealed extensive expression throughout the cytoplasm. In experiments using both antibodies, the pre-bleed controls showed minimal labeling of the cells. Norpeg mRNA expression was analyzed in mouse embryo by in situ hybridization at various stages of development. At 9.5 days, expression (as indicated by a high level of silver grains) was detected in branchial arch mesenchyme, forebrain, hindbrain, midbrain, and neural tube (Fig.6). At 12.5 days, a hybridization signal was detected in the hindbrain, forebrain, lung, genital eminence, spinal ligaments around vertebrae and ribs, and around the cartilage of ribs and nasal sinuses (Fig. 7). Signal was also detected in frontonasal mass, mandibular arch, optic sulcus, spinal ganglia and hind limb bud (data not shown). At 15.5 days, expression was detected in the ventricular layer of neurons subjacent to the neocortex, around the nasal sinuses, bronchioles of the lung, kidney, and around the vertebrae of the tail (Fig.8). Signal was also seen in the olfactory bulb (data not shown).Figure 7In situ hybridization analysis ofNorpeg mRNA expression in 12.5-day mouse embryo.

https://openalex.org/W2024280613,"A chemically induced dimer configuration was prepared on the silicon (Si) (100) surface and was characterized by scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and spectroscopy (STS). These prepared dimers, which are essentially untilted and differ both electronically and structurally from the dynamically tilting dimers normally found on this surface, are more reactive than normal dimers. For molecular hydrogen (H2) adsorption, the enhancement is about 10(9) at room temperature. There is no appreciable barrier for the H2 reaction at prepared sites, indicating the prepared configuration closely approximates the actual dimer structure in the transition state. This previously unknown ability to prepare specific surface configurations has important implications for understanding and controlling reaction dynamics on semiconductor surfaces."
https://openalex.org/W2075935501,"Biotinylation in vivo is an extremely selective post-translational event where the enzyme biotin protein ligase (BPL) catalyzes the covalent attachment of biotin to one specific and conserved lysine residue of biotin-dependent enzymes. The biotin-accepting lysine, present in a conserved Met-Lys-Met motif, resides in a structured domain that functions as the BPL substrate. We have employed phage display coupled with a genetic selection to identify determinants of the biotin domain (yPC-104) of yeast pyruvate carboxylase 1 (residues 1075–1178) required for interaction with BPL. Mutants isolated using this strategy were analyzed by in vivo biotinylation assays performed at both 30 °C and 37 °C. The temperature-sensitive substrates were reasoned to have structural mutations, leading to compromised conformations at the higher temperature. This interpretation was supplemented by molecular modeling of yPC-104, since these mutants mapped to residues involved in defining the structure of the biotin domain. In contrast, substitution of the Met residue N- terminal to the target lysine with either Val or Thr produced mutations that were temperature-insensitive in the in vivo assay. Furthermore, these two mutant proteins and wild-type yPC-104 showed identical susceptibility to trypsin, consistent with these substitutions having no structural effect. Kinetic analysis of enzymatic biotinylation using purified Met → Thr/Val mutant proteins with both yeast and Escherichia coli BPLs revealed that these substitutions had a strong effect upon K mvalues but not k cat. The Met → Thr mutant was a poor substrate for both BPLs, whereas the Met → Val substitution was a poor substrate for bacterial BPL but had only a 2-fold lower affinity for yeast BPL than the wild-type peptide. Our data suggest that substitution of Thr or Val for the Met N- terminal of the biotinyl-Lys results in mutants specifically compromised in their interaction with BPL. Biotinylation in vivo is an extremely selective post-translational event where the enzyme biotin protein ligase (BPL) catalyzes the covalent attachment of biotin to one specific and conserved lysine residue of biotin-dependent enzymes. The biotin-accepting lysine, present in a conserved Met-Lys-Met motif, resides in a structured domain that functions as the BPL substrate.

These enzymes play key roles in essential metabolic processes (1Chapman-Smith A. Cronan Jr., J.E. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 359-363Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). For example, pyruvate carboxylase catalyzes the generation of oxaloacetate, a precursor for the synthesis of glucose and fat as well as some amino acids and neurotransmitters (reviewed in Ref. 2Jitrapakdee S. Wallace J.C. Biochem. J. 1999; 340: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). The biotin prosthetic group is covalently attached via the ε-amino group of a specific Lys residue within the protein (1Chapman-Smith A. Cronan Jr., J.E. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 359-363Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar), in a reaction catalyzed by biotin protein ligase (BPL1; EC6.3.4.15). The primary structure of the biotin domain shows a high degree of homology between a wide range of enzymes and species (3Chapman-Smith A. Cronan Jr., J.E. J. Nutr. 1999; 129: 477s-484sCrossref PubMed Google Scholar) and folds into an independent domain. Deletion studies on enzymes from both prokaryotes (4Cronan Jr., J.E. J. Biol.

J. 1995; 312: 817-825Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) have shown that biotin domains can be expressed as stable proteins of around 80 residues, which can be biotinylated both in vivo and in vitro (8Chapman-Smith A. Turner D.L. Cronan Jr., J.E. Morris T.W. Wallace J.C. Biochem. J. 1994; 302: 881-887Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Furthermore BPLs from various sources have been found to recognize and biotinylate acceptor proteins from very different sources (1Chapman-Smith A. Cronan Jr., J.E. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 359-363Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar, 9Polyak S.W. Chapman-Smith A. Brautigan P. Wallace J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32847-32854Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), suggesting that all biotin domains fold into an essentially common tertiary structure and that the information required for association with BPL is present within this conserved structure.The structures of two biotin domains have been determined: that of theEscherichia coli biotin carboxyl carrier protein (BCCP), a subunit of acetyl-CoA carboxylase (10Athappilly F.K. Hendrickson W.A. Structure. 1995; 3: 1407-1419Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 11Roberts E.L. Shu N.C. Howard M.J. Broadhurst R.W. Chapman-Smith A. Wallace J.C. Morris T. Cronan Jr., J.E. Perham R.N. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 5045-5053Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), and the 1.3 S subunit of the Propionibacterium shermanii transcarboxylase complex (TC) (12Reddy D.V. Rothemund S. Shenoy B.C. Carey P.R. Sonnichsen F.D. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 2156-2163Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). These proteins are structurally homologous to the lipoyl domains of 2-oxo-acid dehydrogenase multienzyme complexes (13Brocklehurst S.M. Perham R.N. Protein Sci. 1993; 2: 626-639Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 14Dardel F. Davis A.L. Laue E.D. Perham R.N. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 229: 1037-1048Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar), which undergo an analogous post-translational modification. They have a flattened β-barrel structure comprising two four-stranded β-sheets with the N- and C- terminal residues close together at one end of the structure. At the other end of the molecule, the biotinyl- or lipoyl-lysine resides on a highly exposed, tight hairpin loop between β-strands four and five. The biotinyl-lysine is found in the motif Met-Lys-Met, which is highly conserved in all biotin domains (3Chapman-Smith A. Cronan Jr., J.E. J. Nutr. 1999; 129: 477s-484sCrossref PubMed Google Scholar). The precise positioning of the Lys appears to be important for recognition by BPL, as moving this residue by one position to either side of its normal position abolishes biotinylation (15Reche P. Li Y.L. Fuller C. Eichhorn K. Perham R.N. Biochem. J. 1998; 329: 589-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Additionally, the properties of the amino acid residues immediately surrounding the target Lys are important. Conservative substitutions of the flanking Met residues have revealed that these amino acids are not essential for interaction with BPL (6Leon-Del-Rio A. Gravel R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22964-22968Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Shenoy B.C. Wood H.G. FASEB J. 1988; 2: 2396-2401Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), but do affect the carboxylation and carboxyl-transfer reactions of P. shermanii TC (17Shenoy B.C. Xie Y. Park V.L. Kumar G.K. Beegan H. Wood H.G. Samols D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 18407-18412Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Kondo H. Uno S. Komizo Y.Y. Sunamoto J. Int. J. Pept. Protein Res. 1984; 23: 559-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). However replacement of the Met-Lys-Met motif of E. coli BCCP with the Asp-Lys-Ala motif characteristic of lipoyl domains, abolishes biotinylation by the bacterial BPL, BirA (19Reche P. Perham R.N. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2673-2682Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Moreover, direct replacement of the lipoylation motif with the biotinylation motif in a lipoyl domain is not sufficient to specify biotinylation (20Wallis N.G. Perham R.N. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 236: 209-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). It is evident that the specificity of biotinylation in vivo requires the interaction of a BPL with a structured protein substrate containing an exposed, precisely positioned Lys side chain.Phage display is a powerful technique for investigating the interaction of proteins and peptides with other macromolecules. Polypeptides are expressed on the surface of filamentous bacteriophage as fusions to either the minor (gIIIp) or major (gVIIIp) coat proteins of the virion (21Clackson T. Wells J.A. Trends Biotechnol. 1994; 12: 173-184Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). The list of proteins that have been displayed on bacteriophage is ever increasing (see, for example, Refs. 22Katz B.A. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 1997; 26: 27-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 23Hudson P.J. Curr. Opin. Biotechnol. 1998; 9: 395-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 24Demartis S. Huber A. Viti F. Lozzi L. Giovannoni L. Neri P. Winter G. Neri D. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 286: 617-633Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Recently the biotin domain of Klebsiella pneumoniae oxaloacetate decarboxylase was displayed on the surface of λ phage (25Stolz J. Ludwig A. Sauer N. FEBS Lett. 1998; 440: 213-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Biotinylated phage were captured using avidin, indicating that the products of an enzymatic reaction can be specifically selected. Using phage display technology, proteins can be remodeled through mutagenesis and mutants with desirable phenotypes selected using an immobilized ligand. An understanding of the residues required for the function of the displayed protein can then be obtained by determining the primary structure of the selected mutants.We have previously shown that the 104 C- terminal residues of pyruvate carboxylase 1 (yPC-104) from Saccharomyces cerevisiae can be expressed as a stable biotin domain in E. coli (7Val D.L. Chapman-Smith A. Walker M.E. Cronan Jr., J.E. Wallace J.C. Biochem. J. 1995; 312: 817-825Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Furthermore, this peptide can be recognized and biotinylated in vivo by the E. coli biotin ligase, BirA. In the present study, we report the expression of biotinylated yPC-104 on the surface of fd bacteriophage. Using phage display coupled with an in vivo selection in E. coli, we have investigated regions on the biotin domain molecule important for the interaction with BPL.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterialsOligonucleotides were purchased from Geneworks Ltd (Adelaide, Australia). The restriction sites in the oligonucleotides are underlined, and mutagenic changes are in bold. The sequences of the oligonucleotides are as follows: YPC104B, 5′-CATACCATGGCAATGAGAAAAATTCGTGTTGCTG-3′; YPC3′B, 5′- TTACTGCAGACTATGCCTTAGTTTCAACAGGAACT-3′; Lys61Leu, 5′- AAGATGTGATCATTTCCATGAGCATGGCGCTTAATACGGCTA-3′; YPC104C, 5′-ACAGAATTCCATGGCAATGAGAAAAATTCGTGTTGCTG-3′; YPC-3′C, 5′-GCACAGCACCACCTGCAGACTA-3′.DNA Manipulations and SequencingPolymerase chain reactions, using 100 ng of oligonucleotides with 10 ng of template, were performed in 40 μl of 1× thermophilic buffer (Promega) containing 2.5–4 mm MgCl2, 2 mm dNTPs, and 1 unit of Taq DNA polymerase with 30 cycles of denaturation at 95 °C for 1 min; annealing at 60–65 °C for 1.5 min, and synthesis at 72 °C for 1.5 min. Sequencing of all the constructs was performed using either the Sequenase Version II kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) or ABI Prism Dye Terminator sequencing (PerkinElmer Life Sciences).DNA encoding yPC-104 was amplified using PCR with the oligonucleotides YPC104B and YPC3′B, with template pMW4A, which contains the cDNA for S. cerevisiae pyruvate carboxylase 1 (26Lim F. Morris C.P. Occhiodoro F. Wallace J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 11493-11497Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The primers introduced Nco I and Pst I endonuclease restriction sites, respectively, facilitating the cloning of the 330-base pair product into the phagemid pGF-14 (27Lucic M.R. Forbes B.E. Grosvenor S.E. Carr J.M. Wallace J.C. Forsberg G. J. Biotech. 1998; 61: 95-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), a derivative of pHEN-1 (28Hoogenboom H.R. Griffiths D. Johnson K.S. Chiswell D.J. Hudson P. Winter G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 4133-4137Crossref PubMed Scopus (891) Google Scholar). This generated the vector pFdBD-104. The biotinylated Lys residue at position 1135 in pyruvate carboxylase 1 was replaced with a Leu residue in the construct pFdBD-K1135L. The mutant was obtained by PCR using the oligonucleotides Lys61Leu and YPC3′B and pFdBD-104 as the template. The mutated DNA was digested with endonuclease restriction endonucleasesBcl I and Pst I and ligated into similarly treated pFdBD-104. Constructs pFdBD-104 and pFdBD-K1135L were transformed intoE. coli XL1-Blue (Stratagene) for phage display.DNA encoding yPC-104 was cloned into the expression vector pKK223–3 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Oligonucleotide YPC104C was employed, using PCR with YPC3′B and pFdBD-104, to add an Eco RI endonuclease restriction site onto the 5′ end of DNA encoding yPC-104. The product was digested with Eco RI and Pst I and cloned into similarly treated pKK223–3, generating the construct pC-104. This vector was subsequently digested with Nco I andPst I and ligated to the 330-base pairNco I/Pst I product liberated from pFdBD-K1135L, yielding the construct pC-K1135L. Proteins expressed from these vectors had an additional Met-Ala motif on the N terminus, as a result of cloning extra nucleotides at the 5′ region of the gene while introducing the Nco I restriction site.Expression of gIIIp Fusion ProteinsXL1-Blue cells harboring either pFdBD-104 or pFdBD-K1135L were grown in 2YT supplemented with ampicillin (100 μg/ml), tetracycline (10 μg/ml), and 10 μm biotin. Overnight cultures were diluted 1:50 in fresh medium and grown to log phase at 37 °C, after which the expression of the fusion protein was induced with 0.02 mm IPTG for 16 h at 30 °C. Cell lysates were prepared as described by Chapman-Smith et al. (8Chapman-Smith A. Turner D.L. Cronan Jr., J.E. Morris T.W. Wallace J.C. Biochem. J. 1994; 302: 881-887Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar) and analyzed by SDS-PAGE on 12% polyacrylamide gels (29Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206024) Google Scholar). Biotinylated proteins were detected by Western blotting as described previously (8Chapman-Smith A. Turner D.L. Cronan Jr., J.E. Morris T.W. Wallace J.C. Biochem. J. 1994; 302: 881-887Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar) and gIIIp fusion proteins detected using anti gIIIp antibody (Mo Bi Tec, Göttingen, Germany).BiopanningPhagemids displaying yeast biotin domains were prepared essentially as described by Lucic et al. (27Lucic M.R. Forbes B.E. Grosvenor S.E. Carr J.M. Wallace J.C. Forsberg G. J. Biotech. 1998; 61: 95-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Phagemids were panned using magnetic beads coated with Streptavidin (Dynal). For diagnostic panning, 30 μg of beads were incubated with 108 phagemids in 1 ml of PBS, 0.1% BSA for 1 h at room temperature, captured using a magnet and washed 10 times in 1 ml of wash buffer (PBS, 0.1% BSA, 0.5% Tween 20). For panning of the library, 300 μg of beads, preblocked in PBS, 0.1% BSA, 0.025% Tween 20 for 1 h at room temperature, were mixed for 15 min at room temperature with 1011 phagemid particles equilibrated in 0.5 ml of wash buffer. The magnetic beads were captured and washed 15 times with 1 ml of wash buffer. After washing, beads were resuspended in PBS, 0.1% BSA and the bead suspension added to log phase XL1-Blue cells for 15 min at 37 °C. Bacteria infected with phagemids were detected by growth on LB media supplemented with 100 μg/ml ampicillin.Construction of Mutagenic LibraryDNA encoding yPC-104 was amplified using error-prone PCR. Oligonucleotides YPC104B and YPC3′C and template pFdBD-104 were employed using the PCR conditions described above, except that dATP was 1 mm and 1 unit of Taq DNA polymerase from a batch known to be of low fidelity (Promega, batch no. 573 1805) were included in the reaction mix. PCR products were digested withNco I and Pst I, and 3.8 pmol of purified insert was incubated with 0.64 pmol of similarly treated pFdBd-K1135L and 2 units of T4 DNA Ligase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). DNA was ethanol-precipitated in the presence of 0.13 m sodium chloride and 50 μg of carrier tRNA, and then dissolved in 20 μl of water. Electrocompetent XL1-Blue cells were prepared (30Sharma R.C. Schimke R.T. BioTechniques. 1996; 20: 42-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) and transformed with 1-μl aliquots of the DNA. The transformants were allowed to recover for 1 h in SOC medium (31Downer W.J. Miller J.F. Ragsdale C.W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 6127-6145Crossref PubMed Scopus (2152) Google Scholar) before an aliquot was withdrawn to estimate the size of the library. Phagemids from the library were prepared using the method of Gu et al. (32Gu H. Yi Q. Bray S.T. Riddle D.S. Shiau A.K. Baker D. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 1108-1117Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) with the following alterations; 2YT was supplemented with 100 μg/ml ampicillin and 10 μm biotin, and expression of the gIIIp fusion protein was induced with 0.02 mm IPTG. After 1 h of helper phage infection, 50 μg/ml kanamycin was added and the culture incubated at 30 °C overnight. Phagemid particles were isolated by precipitation with polyethylene glycol (27Lucic M.R. Forbes B.E. Grosvenor S.E. Carr J.M. Wallace J.C. Forsberg G. J. Biotech. 1998; 61: 95-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) and stored at −80 °C in PBS.In Vitro Biotinylation of Mutant Biotin Domains on PhagemidsPhagemids produced from the library were biotinylated with purified E. coli biotin ligase (a kind gift from D. Beckett, University of Maryland, College Park, MD) in buffer containing 40 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 3 mm ATP, 5.5 mm MgCl2, 50 mm KCl, 5 μm biotin, 0.1 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.1% BSA. Phagemid particles (0.8–1.2 × 1012colony-forming units) were reacted with 0.25 pm enzyme at 37 °C for up to 24 h before panning. Phagemids were recovered from the reaction by precipitation with polyethylene glycol (27Lucic M.R. Forbes B.E. Grosvenor S.E. Carr J.M. Wallace J.C. Forsberg G. J. Biotech. 1998; 61: 95-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) and the pellet washed to remove free biotin before being resuspended in PBS for panning.Analysis of Biotin Domain MutantsComparative in vivo biotinylation of the yPC-104 mutants was performed essentially as described previously by Valet al. (7Val D.L. Chapman-Smith A. Walker M.E. Cronan Jr., J.E. Wallace J.C. Biochem. J. 1995; 312: 817-825Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The mutants were expressed in E. coli TM21 cells by IPTG induction for 2 h from the pC-104-derived expression plasmids described above. Whole cell lysates were prepared using the method described by Chapman-Smith et al. (8Chapman-Smith A. Turner D.L. Cronan Jr., J.E. Morris T.W. Wallace J.C. Biochem. J. 1994; 302: 881-887Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). The expressed yPC-104 proteins was resolved from total cellular protein by fractionation on duplicate 15% (w/v) polyacrylamide gels under denaturing and reducing conditions. Protein was visualized by staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R250 and biotinylated protein detected by avidin alkaline phosphatase blot (8Chapman-Smith A. Turner D.L. Cronan Jr., J.E. Morris T.W. Wallace J.C. Biochem. J. 1994; 302: 881-887Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). The intensity of both the biotinylated band and the yPC-104 protein band were quantitated by laser densitometry and the extent of in vivo biotinylation, expressed as biotinylated protein divided by the total yPC-104 protein, in arbitrary units, for each peptide. This ensured that the quantitation of the extent of in vivo biotinylation was unaffected by any variation in expression levels or protein stability resulting from the introduced mutations.Kinetic analysis of enzymatic biotinylation was performed using purified BPL and apo-yPC-104 peptides as described previously (9Polyak S.W. Chapman-Smith A. Brautigan P. Wallace J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32847-32854Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar).p values were calculated with two-tailed t tests using GraphPad Prism for MacIntosh (GraphPad Software Inc, San Diego, CA). Peptides were purified from E. coli BL21(λDE3) cells harboring expression plasmids derived from pET16b (Novagen). These plasmids were constructed by digesting pET16b with Nco I andPst I and introducing a similarly treated DNA fragment containing the mutant biotin domain coding regions, excised from the plasmids isolated from the in vivo selection.Molecular ModelingIdentification of Homologous StructuresProtein structures in the Protein Data Bank predicted to have homology to yPC-104 were identified by the threading method of Fischer and Eisenberg (34Fischer D. Eisenberg D. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 947-955Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar) as implemented on the UCLA structure-prediction server. The protein structures with compatibility (Z) scores higher than the confidence threshold of 5.0 ± 1.0 were as follows: the lipoyl domain of pyruvate dehydrogenase from Azotobacter vinelandii(Ref. 35Berg A. Vervoort J. Dekok A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 244: 352-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar; IYV, Z = 10.89), the biotinyl domain of acetyl-CoA carboxylase from E. coli (Refs. 10Athappilly F.K. Hendrickson W.A. Structure. 1995; 3: 1407-1419Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar and 11Roberts E.L. Shu N.C. Howard M.J. Broadhurst R.W. Chapman-Smith A. Wallace J.C. Morris T. Cronan Jr., J.E. Perham R.N. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 5045-5053Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar; 1BDO,Z = 9.65), the lipoyl domain of A. vinelandii 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase (Ref. 36Berg A. Vervoort J. Dekok A. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 261: 432-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar; GHJ,Z = 8.25) and the lipoyl domain of pyruvate dehydrogenase from Bacillus stearothermophilus (Ref. 14Dardel F. Davis A.L. Laue E.D. Perham R.N. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 229: 1037-1048Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar; LAB, Z = 5.79). From the individual sequence alignments, a consensus sequence alignment of yPC-104 to these proteins was generated (Fig. 5). Due to the lack of N- terminal regions homologous to that of yPC-104 (residues 1075–1098) in the identified structures, only residues 1099–1170 could be modeled. Secondary structure was predicted for residues 1075–1098 using the PHDsec program (37Rost B. Saunder C. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 232: 584-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (2636) Google Scholar).Homology Model ConstructionHomology models of apo-yPC-104 and holo-yPC-104 residues 1099–1170 were constructed using the HOMOLOGY module of the INSIGHTII software (version 98.0; MSI, San Diego, CA). The structures listed above and the coordinates of the holo-BCCP domain (Refs. 10Athappilly F.K. Hendrickson W.A. Structure. 1995; 3: 1407-1419Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar and 11Roberts E.L. Shu N.C. Howard M.J. Broadhurst R.W. Chapman-Smith A. Wallace J.C. Morris T. Cronan Jr., J.E. Perham R.N. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 5045-5053Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar; 2BDO) and apo-BCCP domain (11, 38; 3BDO) were analyzed to identify the structurally conserved regions (SCRs) by iterative fitting of Cα atom positions and analysis of hydrogen bonding patterns. For NMR ensembles a mean coordinate set, generated using MOLMOL (39Koradi R. Billeter M. Wuthrich K. J. Mol. Graphics. 1996; 14: 51-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (6468) Google Scholar) was used in the comparison process. The defined SCRs and loops are indicated in Fig. 5. For the models of holo- and apo-yPC-104, the SCRs and loop 1 coordinates were modeled on those of holo- and apo-BCCP, respectively. Coordinates for loop 2 in each model were based on loop 2 of the lipoyl domain of pyruvate dehydrogenase (Ref. 35Berg A. Vervoort J. Dekok A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 244: 352-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar; 1IYV).Refinement of ModelsThe two models were further refined by restrained simulated annealing using the program X-PLOR (40Brunger A.T. X-PLOR Version 3.1: A System for X-ray Crystallography. Yale University, New Haven, CT1992Google Scholar) employing the CHARMm force field (41Brooks B.R. Bruccoleri R.E. Olafson B.D. States D.J.

The restraints employed consisted of the backbone hydrogen bonds from the respective structure upon which the model was based (HN-O 1.7–2.0 Å and N-O 2.7–3.0 Å) and harmonic point restraints on the Cα atoms tethering them to their positions in the initial models. This allowed the backbone to remain relatively fixed and the secondary structure to remain intact while side chain positions in the core of the domain could be optimized to reduce steric clashes and promote intimate packing. Simulations were carried out in vacuo with the dielectric constant set to 10 to approximate solvent screening. Coordinate sets were cooled from 2000 to 100 K over 5 ps of dynamics, followed by 500 steps of conjugate gradient energy minimization.DISCUSSIONIn all biotin-dependent enzymes, the residues immediately flanking the biotin-accepting Lys are invariantly Met. Mutation of these residues in both the biotin-accepting subunit ofP. shermanii transcarboxylase (17Shenoy B.C. Xie Y. Park V.L. Kumar G.K. Beegan H. Wood H.G. Samols D. J. Biol.

Protein Res. 1984; 23: 559-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) has revealed that these Met residues are required for the carboxylation of biotin, the first stable intermediate of the biotin carboxylase reaction. It has been demonstrated that the flanking Met residues are not essential for biotinylation by BPLs since proteins having conservative substitutions are still recognized as substrates (6Leon-Del-Rio A. Gravel R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22964-22968Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Shenoy B.C. Wood H.G. FASEB J. 1988; 2: 2396-2401Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). In the present report, we isolated two classes of mutations to the biotin domain of pyruvate carboxylase from Saccharomyces cerevisiae by screening a library of randomly mutated polypeptides using phage display and a genetic selection in E. coli that permits the isolation of peptides with a lowered affinity for bacterial BPL. The first class of mutations isolated contained two distinct, conservative substitutions of the Met residue immediately N- terminal of the target Lys. One mutant, Met1134 → Val, was a poor substrate for both the bacterial and yeast BPLs. In contrast, although the Met1134→ Thr substitution was also a poor substrate for the bacterial BPL, it was only a 2-fold poorer substrate for the yeast BPL than the wild-type protein (Fig. 6, Table II). Our data show that there are subtle differences in the active sites of BPLs from various species which tolerate mutations to the flanking Met to varying degrees. Furthermore, it has been known for some time that BPLs display cross species reactivity (1Chapman-Smith A. Cronan Jr., J.E. Trends Biochem.

IA3 showed subnanomolar potency toward its target, proteinase A from Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and did not inhibit any of a large number of aspartic proteinases with similar sequences/structures from a wide variety of other species. Systematic truncation and mutagenesis of the IA3 polypeptide revealed that the inhibitory activity is located in the N-terminal half of the sequence. Crystal structures of different forms of IA3 complexed with proteinase A showed that residues in the N-terminal half of the IA3 sequence became ordered and formed an almost perfect α-helix in the active site of the enzyme. This potent, specific interaction was directed primarily by hydrophobic interactions made by three key features in the inhibitory sequence. Whereas IA3 was cut as a substrate by the nontarget aspartic proteinases, it was not cleaved by proteinase A.

Members of this proteinase family, e.g. renin, pepsin, cathepsin D, and human immunodeficiency virus-proteinase are generally type-cast on the basis of their susceptibility to inhibition by naturally occurring, small molecule inhibitors such as the acylated pentapeptides, isovaleryl- and acetyl-pepstatin.

Pepstatins are metabolic products produced by various species of actinomycetes and, as such, are not themselves gene-encoded.

The IA3 polypeptide in yeast is an 8-kDa inhibitor of the vacuolar aspartic proteinase (proteinase A or saccharopepsin) that was initially described by Holzer and co-workers (9Saheki T. Matsuda Y. Holzer H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1974; 47: 325-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The complete sequence of this 68-residue inhibitor has been elucidated (10Biedermann K. Montali U. Martin B. Svendsen I.B. Ottesen M. Carlsberg Res. Commun. 1980; 45: 225-235Crossref Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 11Schu P. Wolf D.H. FEBS Lett. 1991; 283: 78-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) and the inhibitory activity of IA3 has been shown to reside within the N-terminal half of the molecule (10Biedermann K. Montali U. Martin B. Svendsen I.B. Ottesen M. Carlsberg Res. Commun. 1980; 45: 225-235Crossref Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 12Li M. Phylip L.H. Lees W.E. Winther J.R. Dunn B.M. Wlodawer A. Kay J. Gustchina A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 113-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). We have recently solved the structure of the IA3-proteinase A complex (12Li M. Phylip L.H. Lees W.E. Winther J.R. Dunn B.M. Wlodawer A. Kay J. Gustchina A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 113-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), demonstrating that whereas free IA3 has little intrinsic secondary structure, residues 2–32 of the inhibitor, upon contact with proteinase A, become ordered and adopt a near perfect α-helical conformation occupying the active site cleft of the enzyme. This was the first crystal structure to be determined for a gene-encoded aspartic proteinase inhibitor complexed with its target enzyme. It was thus considered important to investigate further the role of the proteinase as a folding template and to attempt to establish the molecular features that enable this unprecedented mode of inhibitor-proteinase interaction to occur. Proteinase A and other aspartic proteinases were obtained, and peptides were synthesized by solid-phase methods, as described previously (12Li M. Phylip L.H. Lees W.E. Winther J.R. Dunn B.M. Wlodawer A. Kay J. Gustchina A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 113-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Genomic DNA was extracted from S. cerevisiae and the gene encoding IA3 was amplified specifically by polymerase chain reaction (PCR)1 using 5′-GCATATGAATACAGACCAACAAAAAGTG-3′ and 5′-GCTCGAGCTCCTTCTTATGCCCCGC-3′ as forward and reverse primers. Mutations were introduced into the wild type sequence to generate clones encoding the chimera, (Gly)9 and K7M proteins (TableI) by using the respective forward primers: chimera, 5′-GGAGATATACATATGGGAGGACACGACGTCCCTTTAACAAACATATTTCAGAGCTCA-3′; (Gly)9, 5′-GCATATGGGAGGAGGCGGCGGCGGTGGAGGAGGCATATTTCAGAGCTCA-3′; and K7M, 5′-GCATATGAATACAGACCAACAAATGGTGAGCGAA-3′ in conjunction with the wild type reverse primer described above. The constructs encoding the K24M, K31M/K32M, Mix, D22L, and K18M/D22L mutants were each generated in two steps by overlapping PCR mutagenesis (13Tigue N.J. Kay J. J. Biol.

Open table in a new tab Recombinant protein forms of IA3 consisting of 68 residues plus a ∼Leu-Glu-(His)6 tag at their C terminus were produced inE. coli and purified to homogeneity. The sequence of residues 2–32 (only) of each protein is given. Wild type and mutant forms of IA3 were subcloned into theNdeI-XhoI sites of pET-22b (Novagen, Cambridge, United Kingdom), thus introducing a C-terminal Leu-Glu-His6tag. Escherichia coli strain BL21DE3(pLysS) was transformed with wild type or mutant clones, then grown at 37 °C in LB medium to an A 600 of ∼0.6 before induction with 1 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. Each soluble recombinant protein was loaded onto a nickel-chelate affinity column in 0.05 m sodium phosphate buffer, pH 8.0, containing 0.3 m NaCl, washed with the same buffer adjusted to pH 6.0 containing 10% glycerol and each protein form of IA3 was eluted with the glycerol containing buffer at pH 4.0. Appropriate fractions containing IA3 were then heated twice at 100 °C for 5 min. N-terminal sequencing of wild-type and mutant forms of IA3 was performed by automated Edman degradation on protein bands that were electroblotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membrane following SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis on 20% gels. Samples for amino acid analysis were hydrolyzed for 16 h at 105 °C in 6 m HCl before being loaded onto a Biochrom 20 amino acid analyzer (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Cambridge, UK). MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry was carried out using a PE Biosystems Voyager Elite XL instrument incorporating a UV laser and delayed extraction. Samples at ∼10 pmol/μl were added to a matrix solution consisting of ferulic acid (55 mg/ml in ethanol containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid) in a sample/matrix ratio of 3:1. Inhibition assays were conducted at pH 3.1 and 4.7 as described previously (12Li M. Phylip L.H. Lees W.E. Winther J.R. Dunn B.M. Wlodawer A. Kay J. Gustchina A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 113-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 14Dreyer T. Valler M.J. Kay J. Charlton P. Dunn B.M. Biochem.

Wong M. Friedman T.C. Cawley N.X. Estivariz F.E. Chen H.C. Loh Y.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268 (1975): 11968-11971Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For this enzyme, the substrate used was ACTH (residues 1–39). This was incubated at 37 °C in 50 mm sodium acetate buffer, pH 5.3, with 10 units of purified yapsin 1 (15Azaryan A.V. Wong M. Friedman T.C. Cawley N.X. Estivariz F.E. Chen H.C. Loh Y.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268 (1975): 11968-11971Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) for 30 min in the absence and presence of peptide 1 at final concentrations up to 20 μm. The proteolytic product from ACTH (residues 1–15) was detected and quantified by reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography. The susceptibility of peptide/protein forms of IA3 to proteolytic cleavage was examined by incubation at 37 °C for various lengths of time (commonly 16 or 72 h) with the appropriate enzyme in 100 mm sodium formate/acetate buffers at pH 3.1/4.7, respectively, each containing 300 mm NaCl. Each synthetic peptide was incubated initially with proteinase A for 16 h at a molar ratio of 40:1 and, if no cleavage was detected under these circumstances, then the incubation was repeated at a peptide:proteinase ratio of 10:1 for 72 h. Peptide 1 was incubated with nontarget proteinases such as human pepsin at both pH 3 and 5 at a molar ratio of 1,000:1 for only 1 h. Each digest was separated by reverse-phase fast protein liquid chromatography using a Pep-RPC column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Bucks, United Kingdom) and the fractions containing any cleavage products were collected and subjected to acid hydrolysis followed by amino acid analysis. Protein samples were frozen for storage prior to subsequent mixing with the matrix solution for application to a stainless steel target and analysis by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. Crystals of a complex of proteinase A with the K24M mutant protein form of IA3 (Table I) were grown by vapor diffusion under the conditions described previously for other IA3-proteinase A complexes (12Li M. Phylip L.H. Lees W.E. Winther J.R. Dunn B.M. Wlodawer A. Kay J. Gustchina A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 113-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). The initial solution was prepared at a molar ratio of inhibitor:proteinase of 5:1, and after separation from the excess of inhibitor by gel filtration on Sephadex G-50, was concentrated to 5 mg/ml by ultrafiltration. The mother liquor contained 30% PEG1500, 0.14 m ammonium sulfate in 0.1 m MES buffer, pH 6.0. Data extending to 1.9 Å were collected at 100 K on beamline X9B at NSLS, Brookhaven National Laboratory, Upton, NY, using an ADSC 4K CCD detector. Data were processed with HKL2000 (16Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38573) Google Scholar). The initial data set consisted of 217,446 reflections that could be scaled withR sym of 8.7% (last shell 34.6%) to yield 41,718 unique measurements. The completeness was 92.8% for the whole data and 75.5% for the final shell. The structure of proteinase A complexed with peptide 1 (12Li M. Phylip L.H. Lees W.E. Winther J.R. Dunn B.M. Wlodawer A. Kay J. Gustchina A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 113-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) was used as the initial model with replacement of Lys24 by Met. The structure was refined with CNS 1.0 (17Brünger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16967) Google Scholar) utilizing data extending to 2.0-Å resolution. The first two rounds of refinement included positional and B factor refinements and model adjustment, while solvent molecules were added in the third round. The final model contained the enzyme, residues 2–31 of the inhibitor and 243 water molecules. The final R factor was 19.84% and R free was 23.1%. The root mean square deviations for bond lengths and bond angles from ideality was 0.012 and 1.59 Å, respectively. Modeling calculations were made on a Silicon Graphics Octane with a single R12000 processor using the Moloc modeling package. Individual amino acid side chains (K18M/D22L) in IA3 were changed with a built-in function in Moloc. Side chain conformations were adapted manually and a subsequent round of optimization, maintaining proteinase A and the remainder of IA3 fixed, resulted in low energy conformations for the newly introduced side chains. The new protein-inhibitor complex was checked for attractive and repulsive interactions, and allowed conformations, respectively. The nucleotide sequence encoding all 68 residues of IA3 was amplified by PCR and introduced into the pET-22b vector for expression in E. coli as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The recombinant protein that accumulated in E. coli was soluble and was purified to homogeneity from cell lysates by taking advantage of the His6 tag introduced from the pET-22b vector at the C terminus of the IA3 polypeptide chain (see “Experimental Procedures”). N-terminal analysis of one batch of the homogeneous wild-type inhibitor through 10 cycles of Edman degradation gave the sequence Asn-Thr-Asp-Gln-Gln-Lys-Val-Ser-Glu-Ile, which is exactly coincident with that predicted by the DNA sequence for residues 2–11 (Table I) (11Schu P. Wolf D.H. FEBS Lett. 1991; 283: 78-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) and indicates that the initiator Met1 residue had been removed during the accumulation of this batch of recombinant protein in E. coli. Analysis of a separate batch of recombinant wild-type inhibitor by MALDI-TOF mass spectometry gave a mass of 8772 Da, identical with that predicted (8772 Da) for the IA3sequence plus the C-terminal extension of ∼Leu-Glu-His6introduced from the pET-vector. The K i value determined at pH 3.1 for the inhibition of yeast proteinase A by this C-terminal tagged, wild-type recombinant protein (wild-type in Table I) was comparable to that reported previously at the same pH for the naturally occurring protein purified from S. cerevisiae (14Dreyer T. Valler M.J. Kay J. Charlton P. Dunn B.M. Biochem. J. 1985; 231: 777-779Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). It is readily apparent then that the introduction of the extra ∼Leu-Glu-His6 residues at the C terminus of the recombinant inhibitor did not have any significant detrimental effect on inhibitory potency. Since the target proteinase is unlikely ever to encounter a pH as low as 3.1 in its cellular environment, attempts were also made to determine inhibition constants at higher pH values such as 4.7 and 6.0. In both cases, the interaction with proteinase A was so tight that theK i values lay at or beyond the limits of accurate determination using the available assay methodology and so were estimated to be <0.1 nm. A synthetic peptide which spanned residues 2–34 of the IA3sequence (Peptide 1 in Table II) was found to have inhibitory potency against yeast proteinase A at pH 3.1 and 4.7 comparable to those of the naturally occurring and wild-type recombinant protein forms of IA3, described previously (12Li M. Phylip L.H. Lees W.E. Winther J.R. Dunn B.M. Wlodawer A. Kay J. Gustchina A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 113-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar,14Dreyer T. Valler M.J. Kay J. Charlton P. Dunn B.M. Biochem. J. 1985; 231: 777-779Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). In contrast, peptide 1, at a concentration of 2 μm, had no significant ability to inhibit any one of a number of other aspartic proteinases from a wide range of other species (TableIII). These have considerable sequence and structural similarities to yeast proteinase A and included yapsin 1 (a membrane-attached aspartic proteinase also from S. cerevisiae (15Azaryan A.V. Wong M. Friedman T.C. Cawley N.X. Estivariz F.E. Chen H.C. Loh Y.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268 (1975): 11968-11971Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and other enzymes of fungal, mammalian, parasite (plasmepsin II from Plasmodium falciparum (18Hill J. Tyas L. Phylip L.H. Kay J. Dunn B.M. Berry C. FEBS Lett. 1994; 352: 155-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar) and plant (cyprosin from Cynara cardunculus (19White P.C. Cordeiro M.C. Arnold D. Brodelius P.E. Kay J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16685-16693Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar)) origin. Thus, IA3 is a potent specific inhibitor directed solely against its target enzyme, yeast proteinase A. Since peptide 1 had no effect on the nontarget enzymes listed in Table III, reciprocally, the effect of a number of these (including e.g. human pepsin, cathepsin D, and cathepsin E) on peptide 1 was examined. With human pepsin, for example, using a molar ratio of peptide 1:pepsin of 1,000:1 at pH 3.1 and pH 5, peptide 1 was cleaved rapidly at the ∼Glu10* Ile11∼ and ∼Ala29*Phe30∼ bonds, as revealed by amino acid analysis of the collected peptide fragments (data not shown). Identical results were obtained for the other enzymes so it would appear that peptide 1 is unable to inhibit the nontarget aspartic proteinases such as pepsin, cathepsins D and E (and the other enzymes listed in Table III) because these enzymes cut the polypeptide effectively as a substrate. Consequently, the ∼Ala29*Phe30∼ and ∼Glu10*Ile11∼ sites that were cleaved by the nontarget proteinases were changed singly and in concert to introduce residues at the P1 position which were known from extensive previous studies (e.g. Refs. 20Shintani T. Nomura K. Ichishima E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18855-18861Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar and 21Arnold D. Keilholz W. Schild H. Dumrese T. Stevanovic S. Rammensee H.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 249: 171-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) to be refractory to cleavage by such enzymes as human pepsin and cathepsin D. The resultant peptides (2 and 3, Table II) were just as potent as peptide 1 as inhibitors of proteinase A but still showed no significant ability to inhibit, e.g. human pepsin or cathepsin D at concentrations as high as 5 μm. Although cleavage of peptides 2 and 3 between residues ∼Val29-Phe30∼ and ∼Lys10-Ile11∼ plus ∼Val29-Phe30∼, respectively, was no longer evident, nevertheless, cleavage at other locations now became apparent. For example, after incubation of peptide 3 with human cathepsin D at pH 3.1, the digest was analyzed by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry and the large product that was detected (3238 Da observed; 3237 Da predicted) indicated that cleavage had occurred between residues ∼Gln5*Gln6∼ to generate the fragment spanning residues 6–34. Thus, peptides 1, 2, and 3 appeared to be cleaved by the nontarget proteinases including human pepsin and cathepsin D at whatever peptide bonds were accessible and which met the sub-site specificity requirements of each enzyme.Table IIInteractions between yeast proteinase A and synthetic peptide forms of IA3Identity No.SequenceK ipH 3.1pH 4.72 5 10 15 20 25 30nm1.NTD QQKVS EIFQS SKEKL QGDAK VVSDA FKKZA3 ± 0.6<0.12.NTD QQKVS EIFQS SKEKL QGDAK VVSDV FKKZA2 ± 0.6ND 2-aND, not determined.3.NTD QQKVS KIFQS SKEKL QGDAK VVSDV FKKZA3 ± 1ND4.

The activity of each enzyme at the appropriate, indicated pH value was not affected significantly by inclusion of peptide 1 at a final concentration of 2 μm in each assay. In contrast, peptides 1, 2, and 3 were not cleaved by proteinase A (at pH 3.1 or 4.7), even upon prolonged incubation for 3 days at 37 °C at molar ratios of peptide:proteinase A as low as 5:1. Similarly, the recombinant, wild-type protein form of IA3 (Table I) was not cleaved by yeast proteinase A since the mass ion (8772 Da) observed by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry after prolonged incubation was identical to that of the starting material. However, the wild-type protein was digested by pepsin and cathepsin D, e.g. analysis of the material incubated at pH 3.1 with human cathepsin D indicated that one large product had accumulated which was consistent in size (5575 Da observed; 5578 predicted) with that of a fragment spanning residues Phe30-Glu68 plus the ∼Leu-Glu-(His)6 tag. Thus the full-length protein form of IA3 also appears to be degraded by nontarget proteinases with cleavage taking place, at least, at one of the bonds (∼Ala29*Phe30∼) that was identified earlier for peptide 1 (no attempts were made to detect by mass spectrometry any small products from the N terminus of IA3 in the cathepsin D digest). This ready susceptibility of IA3 in both peptide and protein forms to proteolytic cleavage by nontarget enzymes provides further substantiation to our conclusion described previously (12Li M. Phylip L.H. Lees W.E. Winther J.R. Dunn B.M. Wlodawer A. Kay J. Gustchina A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 113-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) that the free IA3 polypeptide has little intrinsic secondary structure. Since the inhibitory activity of IA3 toward proteinase A appeared to be contained within residues 2–34 (compare K i values for the wild-type protein form (Table I) and the peptide form (peptide 1, Table II)), the effect on inhibitory potency of further truncation of this sequence was examined using a systematic series of synthetic peptides in which residues were successively deleted from the N and C termini. Removal of Asn2 had little effect on theK i value measured at pH 3.1 (compare peptide 4 with peptide 1, Table II) but the potency was diminished somewhat at pH 4.7, as a K i value was readily quantified for peptide 4 at this pH value (Table II). Similarly, deletion of residues 3–6 progressively diminished inhibitory potency (peptides 5 and 6, TableII) and the absence of residues 2–11 (in peptide 7) resulted in almost complete abolition of the inhibitory activity. The activity of IA3 was totally destroyed when residues 2–15 were lacking (peptide 8, Table II). The residues at the N-terminal end of the 2–34 polypeptide sequence would thus appear to contribute substantially to the potency of inhibition. To investigate the importance of the individual side chains of these residues, alterations in sequence were introduced into the full-length protein form of IA3 at its N terminus by PCR mutagenesis as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Initially, residues 2–10 of the wild-type IA3 sequence were replaced with Gly-Gly-His-Asp-Val-Pro-Leu-Thr-Asn. This is the sequence of residues that is present at the N terminus of the target enzyme, yeast proteinase A itself (22Dreyer T. Halkier B. Svendsen I. Ottesen M. Carlsberg Res. Commun. 1986; 51: 27-41Crossref Scopus (39) Google Scholar) and, as such, was chosen totally arbitrarily. The recombinant, chimera inhibitor was purified to homogeneity and 10 cycles of Edman degradation yielded the sequence Gly-Gly-His-Asp-Val-Pro-Leu-Thr-Asn-Ile, identical to that predicted by the DNA sequence, and indicating once again that the initiator Met1 residue had been removed by E. coli proteinases. Consistent with this, analysis by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry gave a mass of 8502 Da, identical to that (8502 Da) predicted for the sequence of residues 2–68 plus the ∼Leu-Glu-His6 tag of the chimeric protein. Remarkably, this chimeric protein with 9/34 (26%) of its residues exchanged was still almost as effective as an inhibitor as the wild-type protein, with its interaction at pH 4.7 still being so tight as to lie at or beyond the limits of accurate determination (Table I). This result, together with the deletion experiments described above with the peptide form of IA3, suggests that, for effective inhibition, backbone atoms contributed by residues 2–10 are ess"

Overexpression of Nrf1p resulted in dose-dependent lethality, with cells exhibiting an ellipsoidal morphology and abnormal vacuolar phenotypes including an increase in vacuolar fusion. Green fluorescent protein (GFP)-Cdc42p and GFP-Nrf1p colocalized to vacuolar membranes and GFP-Nrf1p vacuolar localization depended on Scd1p, the Schizosaccharomyces pombe homolog of the Cdc24p guanine nucleotide exchange factor. In this study, site-directed mutagenesis was conducted on Nrf1p to determine its functional domains. Mutations in the three putative transmembrane domains resulted in mislocalization of GFP-Nrf1p and an inability to induce lethality, suggesting a loss of function. Mutations in the second extramembranous loop of Nrf1p also resulted in a loss of function and altered the ability of GFP-Nrf1p to localize to vacuolar membranes. Analysis of Δnrf1 and Δscd1 mutants revealed defects in endocytosis. In addition, overexpression of constitutively active Cdc42G12Vp resulted in an increase in endocytosis and an ability to rescue the endocytic defects in Δnrf1 and Δscd1 cells.

Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1999; 63: 54-105Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cdc42p acts as a binary switch, active in the GTP-bound state and inactive in the GDP-bound state. The nucleotide-bound state is regulated by guanine-nucleotide exchange factors that mediate the exchange of GDP for GTP, thereby activating Cdc42p and GTPase-activating proteins, which enhance the intrinsic GTPase activity of Cdc42p, thereby inactivating the protein (1Johnson D.I. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1999; 63: 54-105Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe, Cdc42p is essential and regulates directed growth, with the Δcdc42 allele exhibiting a phenotype of small, round cells and activated alleles conferring a phenotype of large, round cells (2Miller P. Johnson D.I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1075-1083Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Scd1p, a putative guanine-nucleotide exchange factor for S. pombe Cdc42p, shares amino acid identity with the Dbl family of Rho-type guanine-nucleotide exchange factors including the Saccharomyces cerevisiae guanine-nucleotide exchange factor Cdc24p. A Δscd1 mutant is viable and exhibits a round cell morphology, suggesting that Scd1p plays a role in directed cell growth (3Chang E.C. Barr M. Wang Y. Jung V. Xu H.-P. Wigler M.H. Cell. 1994; 79: 131-141Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). S. pombe Nrf1p is a 122-amino acid protein with three putative transmembrane domains that was previously identified in a screen for negative regulators of Cdc42p (4Murray J.M. Johnson D.I. Genetics. 2000; 154: 155-165PubMed Google Scholar). A Δnrf1 mutant was viable; however, high level expression of Nrf1p was lethal, resulting in an ellipsoidal morphology and abnormal vacuolar phenotypes including vacuolar coalescence around the nucleus and subsequent fusion of the vacuoles. In S. pombe, vacuoles are numerous, with greater than 50 individual organelles sometimes present within a cell. Green fluorescent protein (GFP)1-Nrf1p and GFP-Cdc42p colocalized to the plasma membrane, nuclear membrane, septum, and vacuolar membranes. The localization of GFP-Nrf1p to the vacuolar membrane and subsequent vacuolar coalescence and fusion depended on Scd1p (4Murray J.M. Johnson D.I. Genetics. 2000; 154: 155-165PubMed Google Scholar). To characterize the functional domains of Nrf1p, site-directed mutations were generated. Mutations generated in the three putative transmembrane domains affected GFP-Nrf1p localization, consistent with the prediction that these transmembrane domains were essential for membrane anchoring. Mutations created in predicted extramembranous domains of Nrf1p had varying effects on GFP-Nrf1p localization and function, with the second loop domain of Nrf1p having a role in targeting Nrf1p to the vacuolar membrane. Studies were also conducted to further examine the role of Scd1p in Nrf1p localization to the vacuole. These studies led to the discovery that Δscd1 and Δnrf1 mutants had a defect in endocytosis, and this defect could be reversed by expression of activated Cdc42p. Together, these data suggest that Cdc42p-dependent signaling pathways play a role in endocytosis in S. pombe. S. pombe cells were grown in yeast extract and supplements (YES) complex media or in Edinburgh minimal media (EMM) lacking uracil, leucine, or both (5Moreno S. Klar A. Nurse P.

Oligonucleotide primers were obtained from Genosys Biotechnologies Inc. (The Woodlands, Texas). Standard methods were used for recombinant DNA manipulations (7Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The pREP3X-GFP-A8-nrf1 +construct was generated by inserting a nrf1 +fragment isolated from pREP41X-GFP-A8-nrf1 + (4Murray J.M. Johnson D.I. Genetics. 2000; 154: 155-165PubMed Google Scholar) into pREP3X-GFP-A8 (provided by A. Merla) at theNot I and Bam HI sites. Site-directed mutations (Fig. 1 A) were created in pREP41X-GFP-A8-nrf1 + using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit obtained from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA). The DNA sequence of all polymerase chain reaction products was verified through the Vermont Cancer Center DNA Sequencing Facility. Vacuolar staining was conducted using carboxy-DCFDA or FM 4-64 (Molecular Probes, Eugene OR). The cells were grown to mid-log phase under derepressing conditions (described above) and incubated for 30 min in fresh media containing 10 μmcarboxy-DCFDA or 20 μg/ml FM 4-64. These cells were then washed with media, and half of the cells were resuspended in H20 for carboxy-DCFDA staining or allowed to incubate for 30 min post-washing before visualization for FM 4-64 staining. GFP images were captured at mid-log phase after 18–28 h under derepressing conditions (described above). Digital images were captured and analyzed as described previously (4Murray J.M. Johnson D.I. Genetics. 2000; 154: 155-165PubMed Google Scholar). Total cellular protein was isolated from cells containing nmt1 promoter-driven GFP-Nrf1p fusion proteins. The cells were grown in EMMS-Leu−Thi liquid media to mid-log phase, collected, washed with H20, resuspended in 100 μl of 1× phosphate-buffered saline, and spheroplasted at 37 °C in the presence of 100 μg/ml zymolyase until a sample showing greater than 80% lysis was observed upon the addition of SDS to 0.1%. The spheroplasts were then collected and resuspended in lysis buffer (0.3m sorbitol, 140 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris pH 8.0) with protease inhibitors (1:100 dilutions of 5 mg/ml aprotinin, 5 mg/ml leupeptin in water, 6 mg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 5 mg/ml pepstatin in methanol). SDS (0.1%) was added, and the samples were vortexed briefly. Protein samples were diluted 1:2 in SDS lysis buffer (8Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207208) Google Scholar) containing 40% β-mercaptoethanol, heated at 100 °C for 5 min, and separated on an 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, and protein was transferred to nitrocellulose paper (BA-S83, 0.02 μm; Schleicher & Schuell). 20 μg of protein was loaded in each lane, as indicated by the Bradford protein assay method. Mouse anti-GFP antibody (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) was used at a 1:1000 dilution, and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG secondary antibody (Sigma) was used at a dilution of 1:3000. Antibody-antigen complexes were visualized using the Renaissance system (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). One ml of cells grown in minimal media and under derepressing conditions (when necessary) were harvested and washed twice with media, resuspended in 500 μl of media containing 5 mg/ml of lucifer yellow carbonyl hydrazine (Sigma), and incubated for 60 min at 23 °C. Cells were washed three times with media and visualized. Lucifer yellow uptake assays were conducted as described previously (9Goode N.T. Hajibagheri M.A.N. Warren G. Parker P.J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1994; 5: 907-920Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) with the following changes: 5 ml of cells were grown as above and washed twice in ice-cold media and resuspended in 200 μl of ice-cold media containing 5 mg/ml of lucifer yellow carbonyl hydrazine, and half (100 μl) of each sample was incubated at 32 °C with the other half kept on ice. After 90 min, the cultures were washed three times with ice-cold H2O, treated with zymolyase for 30 min at 37 °C, then lysed with acid-washed glass beads for 1 min. 400 μl of media was added to the beads, and the liquid was transferred to a fresh tube, then centrifuged for 15 min at 10,000 × g. The fluorescence (excitation, 426 nm; emission, 550 nm) was determined using a fluorimeter and quantified by comparison to a standard curve of lucifer yellow fluorescence. GFP-Nrf1p was previously shown to localize to the plasma membrane, nuclear membrane, septum, and vacuolar membrane (4Murray J.M. Johnson D.I. Genetics. 2000; 154: 155-165PubMed Google Scholar). To determine if the three predicted transmembrane domains in Nrf1p were functional, three amino acids in the middle of each putative domain were mutated to charged residues (Fig. 1 A). These mutations (nrf1 tm1, nrf1 tm2, andnrf1 tm3 ) were constructed in pREP3X-GFP-A8-nrf1 +, a high level expression vector, and expressed as GFP-Nrf1p fusion proteins. Total protein was isolated from wild-type ED668 cells containing GFP-Nrf1p, GFP-Nrf1tm1p, GFP-Nrf1tm2p, or GFP-Nrf1tm3p, and all were expressed at similar levels (Fig. 1 B). Although high level overexpression of GFP-Nrf1p was lethal (4Murray J.M. Johnson D.I. Genetics. 2000; 154: 155-165PubMed Google Scholar), the three transmembrane mutant proteins did not confer lethality when overexpressed (Fig.2 A). The localization of these mutant proteins was abnormal with no vacuole localization, variable levels of diminished plasma and nuclear membrane localization, and a general increase in the presence of cytosolic GFP aggregates (Fig.2 B). These data suggest that all three of these domains are necessary for efficient localization of GFP-Nrf1p to plasma, nuclear, and especially vacuolar membranes, supporting the hypothesis that these are functional transmembrane domains. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed on the putative extramembranous loops of Nrf1p to determine which were necessary for function. The “positive inside” observation was followed, which predicts that the nontranslocated loops of a protein are enriched in positively charged residues as compared with translocated loops (10von Heijne G. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 225: 487-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (1402) Google Scholar). Three charged residues within a stretch of five amino acids in the predicted nontranslocated (i.e. cytoplasmic) loops were changed to alanine residues in pREP3X-GFP-A8-nrf1 + (Fig.1 A). Total protein was isolated, and the level of expression of GFP-Nrf1nt-1p, GFP-Nrf1L2–1p, GFP-Nrf1L2–2p was comparable with wild-type GFP-Nrf1p (Fig. 1 B). Overexpression of GFP-Nrf1nt-1p was lethal, and localization of the protein appeared similar to GFP-Nrf1p, suggesting that these charged residues were not necessary for the proper localization of GFP-Nrf1p or its lethality when overexpressed. Overexpression of GFP-Nrf1L2–1p did not confer lethality, and no fluorescence was localized to the vacuole, although the plasma membrane and nuclear membrane localization appeared enhanced compared with overexpression of wild-type GFP-Nrf1p (Fig.3, A and B). These data indicate that this portion of the second extramembranous loop was necessary for efficient localization to the vacuoles and was also necessary for the protein to cause a lethal defect when overexpressed. Overexpression of GFP-Nrf1L2–2p also did not confer lethality, but it localized similarly to wild-type GFP-Nrf1p (Fig. 3,A and B). These data indicate that thenrf1 L2–2 mutation affects the ability of Nrf1p to cause a lethal phenotype when overexpressed; however, it does not appear to affect the localization of the protein in wild-type cells. The localization of Nrf1p to vacuoles and subsequent coalescence of vacuoles around the nucleus and vacuolar fusion depended on Scd1p (4Murray J.M. Johnson D.I. Genetics. 2000; 154: 155-165PubMed Google Scholar). To determine if Scd1p may affect the localization of the GFP-Nrf1 mutant proteins, we expressed them in Δscd1 cells. Overexpression of wild-type GFP-Nrf1p or GFP-Nrf1nt-1p was lethal in Δscd1 cells; however, overexpression of the other GFP-Nrf1 mutant proteins did not affect the viability of this strain (data not shown). GFP-Nrf1nt-1p was localized to the plasma and nuclear membranes but was not observed in the vacuolar membranes similarly to wild-type GFP-Nrf1p, suggesting that this mutation does not affect localization of GFP-Nrf1p in Δscd1 cells (Fig. 4). The three transmembrane mutant proteins GFP-Nrf1tm1p, GFP-Nrf1tm2p, and GFP-Nrf1tm3p all showed a similar localization pattern with no vacuole localization and variable levels of diminished plasma membrane and nuclear membrane localization, comparable with the localization pattern in wild-type cells (data not shown). Localization of GFP-Nrf1L2–1p was as predicted, with localization to the plasma and nuclear membranes only (Fig. 4). However, GFP-Nrf1L2–2p localization was similar to that observed in wild-type cells, with localization to the plasma membrane, nuclear membrane, and the vacuolar membranes, indicating a bypass of the Scd1p requirement for vacuolar membrane localization (Fig. 4). These data further implicate the second extramembranous loop of Nrf1p in the localization of GFP-Nrf1p to the vacuolar membranes and suggest that there may exist a Scd1p-independent mechanism for Nrf1p localization. These above-mentioned localization results suggested that Nrf1p may first be targeted to the plasma membrane and subsequently localize to the vacuolar membrane through endocytosis, implicating Scd1p and/or Nrf1 in the endocytosis pathway. To examine this possibility, lucifer yellow uptake was assayed in wild-type, Δscd1, and Δnrf1 cells as well as Δypt7 cells, which are deficient in vacuolar fusion and, hence, endocytosis. Δscd1 cells showed a decrease in endocytosis similar to what was observed with Δypt7 cells, whereas Δnrf1 cells showed a lesser deficiency in uptake of lucifer yellow (Fig. 5 A). These data are consistent with Scd1p and Nrf1p having a positive function in endocytosis. To determined whether endocytosis in wild-type or Δscd1 cells could be affected by overexpression of Nrf1p or the Nrf1 mutant proteins, the nrf1 mutations described previously were inserted into pREP1-nrf1, a high level expression plasmid. As with overexpression of GFP-Nrf1p fusion proteins, overexpression of the wild-type Nrf1p or Nrf1nt-1p from these plasmids led to lethality after extended induction periods in both strains, whereas overexpression of the other mutant proteins did not (data not shown). Overexpression of wild-type Nrf1p or Nrf1nt-1p caused a significant decrease in lucifer yellow uptake in wild-type cells under conditions where the cells were still viable, whereas overexpression of the other mutant proteins led to at least as much lucifer yellow uptake as the vector control (Fig. 5 B). These data suggest that overexpression of functional Nrf1p leads to a decrease in endocytosis. Overexpression of Nrf1p or any of the mutant proteins did not affect lucifer yellow uptake in the Δscd1 strain (data not shown). Overexpression of Nrf1L2–2p, which localizes to the vacuole in Δscd1 cells, did not increase endocytosis in these cells, suggesting that targeting of Nrf1p to the vacuole (at least of this mutant protein) could occur independent of Scd1p-dependent endocytosis. To examine whether Cdc42p may be involved in endocytosis, dominant-activated Cdc42G12Vp and dominant-negative Cdc42T17Np were overexpressed in wild-type cells, and the ability to uptake lucifer yellow was analyzed. Overexpression of dominant-activated Cdc42G12Vp produced a 3–5-fold increase in lucifer yellow uptake (Fig.6 A), with no vacuolar abnormalities or coalescence observed (data not shown). A modest increase in lucifer yellow uptake was also observed with overexpression of dominant-negative Cdc42T17Np (Fig. 6 A). These results suggest that overexpression of Cdc42 mutant proteins can influence endocytosis. A small decrease in lucifer yellow uptake was also observed upon overexpression of kinase-inactive Pak1K415R,K416Rp, suggesting that Pak1p may be involved in the endocytic process. These data raise the possibility that the endocytic defects observed in the Δscd1 and Δnrf1 mutants may be the result of decreased Cdc42p activity. To test this possibility, dominant-activated Cdc42G12Vp was overexpressed in the Δscd1 and Δnrf1 strains. Overexpression of Cdc42G12Vp rescued the endocytosis defect in both the Δscd1 and Δnrf1 strains (Fig. 6 B) but not the defect observed in cells overexpressing Nrf1p (data not shown), suggesting that the endocytosis defect observed in these strains was due to a decrease in Cdc42p activity (see “Discussion”). Vacuoles fuse in response to osmotic stress (i.e. placement in H2O), and this fusion has been shown to be dependent on the Pmk1p/Spm1p mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade as well as the conserved Rab-like GTPase Ypt7p, which is necessary for vacuolar fusion in S. cerevisiae (11Bone N. Millar J.B.A. Toda T. Armstrong J. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 135-144Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 12Haas A. Scheglman D. Lazer T. Gallwitz D. Wickner W. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5258-5270Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). To determine whether the vacuolar coalescence around the nucleus and subsequent vacuole fusion observed in cells overexpressing Nrf1p act by a similar mechanism, Nrf1p was overexpressed in Δpmk1 and Δypt7 mutant strains. As previously shown in wild-type cells, overexpression of Nrf1p was lethal in these strains (data not shown). The vacuolar morphology was observed by carboxy-DCFDA staining and confirmed by subsequent localization of GFP-Nrf1p. The Δpmk1 strain showed the abnormal vacuolar phenotypes associated with Nrf1p overexpression, but no vacuolar changes were observed in the Δypt7 cells (TableII). GFP-Nrf1p localization appeared normal in the Δpmk1 cells, but the Δypt7 strain showed localization only to the plasma membrane (data not shown). These data suggested that the localization of Nrf1p to the vacuole and the subsequent abnormal vacuolar morphology was independent of Pmk1p but was dependent on Ypt7p.Table IINrflp-induced vacuolar abnormalitiesStrainPlasmid% normal% abnormal2-aRepresents cells with vacuoles coalesced around the nucleus. n = 200.ED668pREP1982ED668pREP1-nrfl +6535Δscd1pREP11000Δscd1pREP1-nrf1+991Δypt7pREP11000Δypt7pREP1-nrf1 +1000Δpmk1pREP1964Δpmk1pREP1-nrf1 +68322-a Represents cells with vacuoles coalesced around the nucleus. n = 200. Open table in a new tab To determine whether Scd1p or Nrf1p may be necessary for vacuolar fusion induced by osmotic stress, Δscd1 and Δnrf1 cells were grown in YES media, stained with carboxy-DCFDA, and shifted into H20 to observe the vacuolar morphology (Fig. 7). Fusion was observed in Δscd1 cells as well as Δnrf1 cells, suggesting that the vacuolar fusion induced by osmotic stress is independent of Scd1p and Nrf1p. These data are consistent with the vacuolar fusion induced by overexpression of Nrf1p occurring through a separate mechanism. Nrf1 proteins that contained mutations in the putative transmembrane domains designed to perturb the predicted hydophobicity of this domain no longer conferred a lethal phenotype and were mislocalized, with a decrease in membrane localization and an increase in GFP aggregates, suggesting that these domains were necessary for efficient targeting to membranes. The nrf1 nt-1mutation did not affect the GFP localization or lethality conferred by overexpression, whereas mutations in the predicted second extramembranous loop did, suggesting that this region of the protein was involved in localization of GFP-Nrf1p to the vacuolar membrane. Both GFP-nrf1 L2–1p and GFP-nrf1 L2–2p no longer conferred lethality when overexpressed, and GFP-nrf1 L2–1p did not localize to the vacuolar membrane, whereas GFP-nrf1 L2–2p localized to the vacuolar membrane independent of Scd1p. Both deletion and overexpression of nrf1 led to similar defects in endocytosis. This seemingly paradoxical result is reminiscent of results with Cdc24p in S. cerevisiae in which both deletion and overexpression of Cdc24p led to a loss-of-function phenotype (13Ziman M. Johnson D.I. Yeast. 1994; 10: 463-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). One explanation could be that loss of a protein and excess amounts of a protein both adversely affect the stability and/or function of a multiprotein complex essential for the process in question. Deletion of scd1 also led to a decrease in endocytosis, whereas overexpression of dominant-activated Cdc42G12Vp led to a 3–5-fold increase in endocytosis and rescued the defect in Δscd1 and Δnrf1 cells. These data implicate the Cdc42p-dependent signaling pathway in the endocytic process in S. pombe. Overexpression of dominant-negative Cdc42T17Np also led to a modest increase in endocytosis, suggesting that this allele may not function negatively in the endocytosis pathway. In mammalian cell lysates, endocytic vesicles have been shown to move at the ends of actin tails, and the Cdc42p effector, Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein (WASp), has been shown to be involved in the nucleation of actin and subsequent propulsion of these vesicles (14Merrifield C.J.

Two Rho-type GTPase inhibitors, ToxB and RhoGDI, interfered with this process, and purification of a soluble factor capable of rescuing the ToxB defect was identified as a Cdc42p-RhoGDI complex (15Taunton J. Rowning B.A. Coughlin M.L. Wu M. Moon R.T. Mitchison T.J. Larabell C.A. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 519-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). These data are consistent with the Cdc42p-dependent signaling pathway being involved in the trafficking of endocytic vesicles. In mammalian cells, Cdc42p localizes to Golgi membranes and has been shown to regulate targeted secretion to the basolateral membrane in polarized epithelial cells (17Erickson J.W. Zhang C.J. Kahn R.A. Evans T. Cerione R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26850-26854Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar, 18Kroschewski R. Hall A. Mellman I. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 8-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). Microinjection of plasmids encoding dominant-negative Cdc42T17Np resulted in a mistargeting of proteins normally destined for the basolateral membrane as well as a mistargeting of basolateral endocytosed proteins. Microinjection of activated Cdc42Q61Lp-encoding plasmids resulted in a complete loss of plasma-membrane polarity (18Kroschewski R. Hall A. Mellman I. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 8-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). Cdc42p has also been shown to interact with the COPI coatomer complex, specifically through the γCOP subunit (19Wu W.J. Erickson J.W. Lin R. Cerione R.A. Nature. 2000; 405: 800-804Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). COPI subunits have been purified from isolated endosomes, suggesting that COPI is involved in targeting in the endocytic pathway as well (20Whitney J.A. Gomez M. Sheff D. Kreis T.E. Mellman I. Cell. 1995; 83: 703-713Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar, 21Aniento F. Gu F. Parton R.G. Gruenberg J. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 29-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). Thecdc42 F28L-transforming mutant showed a defect in COPI recruitment to vesicles; however, a triple Cdc42F28L,K183S,K184S mutant protein that could no longer interact with γCOP resulted in a lack of transformation ability (19Wu W.J. Erickson J.W. Lin R. Cerione R.A. Nature. 2000; 405: 800-804Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). This mutant protein contained two altered C-terminal lysine residues necessary for COPI binding, suggesting that Cdc42p interaction with COPI was necessary for its ability to transform cells. Altogether, these data implicate mammalian Cdc42p in both exocytic and endocytic trafficking, and the data herein implicate S. pombe Cdc42p in the endocytic pathway, suggesting a conserved role for this GTPase in these processes. In S. pombe, vacuoles are numerous, with greater than 50 individual organelles sometimes present within a cell. Under hypo-osmotic stress conditions, the vacuoles can fuse into one or two large organelles (11Bone N. Millar J.B.A. Toda T. Armstrong J. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 135-144Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). This osmotic stress-induced fusion is dependent on the Rab-type GTPase Ypt7p and the Sty1p and Pmk1p mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade pathways. Deletion of the Sty1p or Pmk1p mitogen-activated protein kinases or Ypt7p resulted in a severe defect in vacuole fusion when S. pombe cells were isolated from rich media and placed in H2O (11Bone N. Millar J.B.A. Toda T. Armstrong J. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 135-144Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). The acidification of these vacuoles did not appear to be affected, as the pH-dependent fluorescent vital stain carboxy-DCFDA stained vacuoles in these cells. In this study, it was shown that the vacuolar fusion induced by overexpression of Nrf1p depended on Ypt7p but not on Pmk1p, and osmotically induced vacuolar fusion was not dependent on Nrf1p or Scd1p, suggesting that there exist at least two distinct vacuolar fusion mechanisms. Recently the S. cerevisiae Nrf1p homolog (Vtc1p/Nrf1p) was copurified with the vacuolar-ATPase subunit (v-ATPase) Vma10p (22Cohen A. Perzov N. Nelson H. Nelson N. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26885-26893Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). A Δvtc1 mutant showed no morphological defect; however, a reduction in quinacrine uptake into purified vacuoles suggested that the vacuoles were not properly acidified, which depends on the v-ATPase. v-ATPase deletion mutant cells can survive a lack of acidification by taking up external fluid via endocytosis but are inviable in media at a pH higher than 7.0 (23Nelson N. Harvey W.R. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 361-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). A Δvma8Δvtc1 double mutant was viable at a higher pH, and vacuoles isolated from a Δvtc1 strain showed a decrease in the level of v-ATPase units associated with these membranes (22Cohen A. Perzov N. Nelson H. Nelson N. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26885-26893Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Vtc1p appears to be a member of a conserved family of proteins (Vtc1p-4) that are found in a complex on the vacuolar membrane in S. cerevisiae (22Cohen A. Perzov N. Nelson H. Nelson N. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26885-26893Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). 2A. Mayer, personal communication. These data suggest a possible role for Nrf1p/Vtc1p in the proper targeting of v-ATPase subunits to the vacuole. There is growing evidence for Cdc42p being involved in vesicle trafficking in mammalian cells. In this study, overexpression of constitutively GTP-bound Cdc42p led to an increase in endocytosis inS. pombe and rescued the endocytosis defect in the Δscd1 and Δnrf1 strains. Interestingly, a recent study has also implicated Cdc42p in the control of endocytosis in mammalian dendritic cells (24Garrett W.S. Chen L. Kroschewski R. Ebersold M. Turley S. Trombetta S. Galan J.E. Mellman I. Cell. 2000; 102: 325-334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar). These results suggest that a function for Cdc42p in vesicle trafficking may be conserved throughout eukaryotes. GFP-Cdc42p also localizes to the vacuole and may be involved in vacuolar fusion (4Murray J.M. Johnson D.I. Genetics. 2000; 154: 155-165PubMed Google Scholar). Although endocytosis and vacuolar fusion may not be distinct processes (for example, deletion ofypt7 leads to a defect in vacuolar fusion and therefore shows a defect in lucifer yellow uptake), the fact that Nrf1p and Scd1p are not required for osmotically induced vacuolar fusion suggests that the endocytic defect in Δscd1 and Δnrf1 deletion strains is not a result of a general defect in vacuolar fusion. Further examination of the functions of Nrf1p, Scd1p, and Cdc42p in S. pombe will help to uncover whether these proteins act during vesicle formation, trafficking, and/or vacuolar fusion. We thank J.

Ward and members of the Johnson lab for thoughtful discussions and critical reading of this manuscript."

The synthesis rate and level of the strictly inducible Hsp68 was significantly higher after HS (44 °C) compared with OS (2 mmH2O2). This difference corresponded to higher and lower activation of the heat shock factor (HSF) by HS and OS, respectively. OS, on the other hand, showed stronger cytotoxicity compared with HS as indicated by drastic lipid peroxidation and inhibition of protein synthesis as well as of mitochondrial and endocytotic activity. Lactic dehydrogenase also revealed stronger inhibition of enzyme activity by OS than by HS as shown in cells and in vitro experiments. Conformational analysis of lactic dehydrogenase by the fluorophore 1-anilinonaphtalene-8-sulfonic acid, however, showed stronger exposure of hydrophobic domains after HS than after OS which correlates positively with the Hsp68 response.

Experientia. 1962; 18: 571-573Crossref Scopus (1452) Google Scholar), are induced in response to a wide range of biological and physicochemical stressors, including heat shock (HS) and oxidative stress (1Ritossa F.M. Experientia. 1962; 18: 571-573Crossref Scopus (1452) Google Scholar, 2Morimoto, R. I., Tissieres, A., and Georgopoulos, C. (eds) (1994) The Biology of Heat Shock Proteins and Molecular Chaperones, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, Plainview, NYGoogle Scholar). Prominent stress proteins are represented by members of the Hsp70 family, which consists of constitutive (Hsc70) and inducible isoforms (Hsp68). Hsp68 and Hsc70 act as chaperones and protect the cell by binding to malfolded proteins resulting from exposure to stress, thus preventing their aggregation and either helping these proteins to refold to their active state or targeting them to lysosomes for protein degradation (2Morimoto, R. I., Tissieres, A., and Georgopoulos, C. (eds) (1994) The Biology of Heat Shock Proteins and Molecular Chaperones, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, Plainview, NYGoogle Scholar, 3DeMaio A. Shock. 1999; 11: 1-12Crossref Scopus (496) Google Scholar).Activation of hsp68 seems to be predominantly regulated by the heat shock transcription factor (HSF-1) which binds to heat shock elements (HSEs) in the hsp68 promoter (4Wu C. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1995; 11: 441-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (963) Google Scholar). HSF-1 is apparently regulated by trimerization, phosphorylation, redox modification, and compartmentation (4Wu C. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1995; 11: 441-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (963) Google Scholar, 5Huang L.E. Zhang H. Bae S.W. Liu A.Y.C. J. Biol.

A. 1999; 96: 6769-6774Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Together with the expression of isoforms (7Goodson M.L. Sarge K.D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 211: 943-949Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) these results suggest a multistep regulation of HSF (8Zuo J. Rungger D. Voellmy R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4319-4330Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar,9Chen H.W. Chou F.P. Lue S.I. Yang R.C. Shock. 1999; 12: 63-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). In addition to HSE, the hsp68 promoter contains binding sites for nuclear factor κB (NFκB) which is strongly activated by hydrogen peroxide (10Schulze-Osthoff K. Los M. Baeuerle A. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1995; 50: 735-741Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). Other transcription factors such as signal transducers and activators of transcription, transcription factor IID, Sp-1, and CCAAT-box binding factor may also influence the induction of hsp68 (11Williams G.T. Morimoto R.I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 3125-3136Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 12Hung J.J. Cheng T.J. Chang M.D. Chen K.D. Huang H.L. Lai Y.K. J. Cell.

The differential activation of these and other factors by HS and OS and their interplay may ultimately cause a differential induction of hsp68.It is still unclear whether the activation of the hsp68 gene by the great diversity of stressors depends on a common signal pathway. Initially, it was speculated that abnormal proteins may trigger HSF activation (14Munro S. Pelham H. Nature. 1985; 317: 477-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 15Anathan J. Goldberg A.L. Voellmy R. Science. 1986; 232: 522-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (692) Google Scholar). Later, it was demonstrated that Hsp70 forms a complex with HSF and that excess Hsp70 suppress HSF activation (16Abravaya K. Meyers M.P. Murphy S.P. Morimoto R.I. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 1153-1164Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar, 17Mosser D.D. Duchaine J. Massie B. Mol. Cell.

It was hypothesized, therefore, that denatured proteins reduce the concentration of free Hsp70 by complex formation. This decrease of free Hsps relieves their inhibitory action on the HSF which can subsequently convert from the monomeric, non-DNA binding form into the trimeric active form (2Morimoto, R. I., Tissieres, A., and Georgopoulos, C. (eds) (1994) The Biology of Heat Shock Proteins and Molecular Chaperones, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, Plainview, NYGoogle Scholar). Binding of Hsp70 to the HSF-1 transactivation domain was shown to be responsible for the repression of hsp70 transcription (19Shi Y. Mosser D.D. Morimoto R.I. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 654-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar). Moreover, Hsp90 seems to be involved in the repression of HSF under physiological conditions (20Zuo J. Guo Y Guettouche T. Smith D.F. Voellmy R. Cell. 1998; 94: 471-480Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (925) Google Scholar).On the other hand, studies exist which do not agree with the hypothesis of a feedback control mechanisms of HSF, because they failed to observe an effect of different amounts of Hsp70 on HSF activation (21Zimarino V. Wu C. Nature. 1987; 327: 727-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar, 22Sarge K.D. Murphy S.P. Morimoto R.I. Mol. Cell.

Biol. 1994; 14: 6552-6560Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Noteworthy, purified HSF can be reversibly trimerized in vitro by heat shock, hydrogen peroxide, and low pH, indicating that the monomeric HSF can directly sense stressors in the absence of other factors (24Larson J.S. Schuetz T.J. Kingston R.E. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 1902-1911Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 25Farkas T. Kutskova Y.A. Zimarino V. Mol. Cell.

The monomer-trimer transition of HSF was shown to be autoregulated through intramolecular coiled-coil interactions of specific leucin zippers (25Farkas T. Kutskova Y.A. Zimarino V. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 906-918Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 27Rabindran S.K. Haroun R.I. Clos J. Wisniewski J. Wu C.

Chem. 1999; 274: 17219-17225Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Alternatively, different signal transduction pathways may be involved in hsp68 induction by different stressors (29Gosslau A. Rensing L. Brain Res. 2000; 864: 114-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar) which is consistent with different HSF-1 activation by various stressors (30Hatayama T. Hayakawa M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 30: 763-769Crossref Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Different regulation of HSF activity may depend on different activation of protein phosphatases and protein kinases which control phosphorylation of HSF-1 at serine residues (31Liu X.D. Thiele D.J. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 592-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 32Ding X.Z. Tsokos G.C. Kiang J.G. FASEB J. 1998; 12: 451-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 33Ohnishi K. Wang X. Takahashi A. Matsumoto H. Ohnishi T. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1999; 197: 129-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar).Reactive oxygen species which accumulate during oxidative and other types of stress are discussed as another general trigger for HSF activation, for example, by redox modifications (5Huang L.E. Zhang H. Bae S.W. Liu A.Y.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30718-30725Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 34Jacquier-Sarlin M.R. Polla B.S. Biochem. J. 1996; 318: 187-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Reactive oxygen species are elicited by external sources (heat shock, X-ray, and UV radiation, electrosmog, toxins etc. (35Burdon R.H. Gill V.M. Rice-Evans C. Free Radic. Res. Commun. 1987; 3: 129-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 36Das D.K. Maulik N. Moraru I.I. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 1995; 27: 181-193Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar)), but are also generated intracellularly through electron leackage from mitochondria, activity of oxygen-utilizing enzymes and by macrophages generating superoxide anion radicals (·O2−) (37Sies H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 215: 213-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (1589) Google Scholar, 38Davies K.J.A. Rice-Evans C. Halliwell B. Lunt G.G. Free Radicals and Oxidative Stress: Environment, Drugs and Food Additives. Portland Press, London1995: 1-31Google Scholar). These radicals either dismutate autonomously or are converted enzymatically by superoxide dismutase to hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). H2O2 is rather stable but decomposes to the highly reactive hydroxyl radical (·OH) in the presence of trace metals such as iron by the Fenton reaction (39Halliwell B. Gutteridge J.M.C. Biochem. J. 1984; 219: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (4514) Google Scholar).In our study, the induction of hsp68 and HSF activation by heat shock was significantly stronger than by oxidative stress. We observed that HS (44 °C) also caused stronger exposure of hydrophobic domains of lactic dehydrogenase than OS (2 mmH2O2) which agrees with the assumption that denatured proteins represent a common signal for the Hsp68 response. Interestingly, this finding did not correlate with the suppression of LDH activity. Deoxyspergualin (DSG) which exhibit high affinity to constitutive Hsps strongly increased only OS-induced hsp68expression in contrast to the induction after 44 °C exposure. This implies that hydrophobic interactions between Hsps and denatured proteins are maximal only in response to HS. Our results thus suggest that hydrophobic domains of cytosolic proteins represent a common denominator in the multistep induction pathway of hsp68 by heat shock and oxidative stress.DISCUSSIONResponses to HS and OS in C6 rat glioma cells were compared to test the hypothesis of a common signal involved in the induction pathway of stress proteins. Expression of hsp68 was significantly stronger and faster induced by HS compared with OS as reported previously (34Jacquier-Sarlin M.R. Polla B.S. Biochem.

Chou F.P. Lue S.I. Yang R.C. Shock. 1999; 12: 63-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 57Liu R.Y. Corry P.M. Lee Y.J. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1995; 144: 27-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). This inhibitory action of the constitutive HSE binding factor may explain the enhanced HSF-1 binding activities by various stressors determinedin vitro without an apparent transcription of stress genesin vivo (55Bruce J.L. Price B.D. Coleman N. Calderwood S.K. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 12-15PubMed Google Scholar, 57Liu R.Y. Corry P.M. Lee Y.J. Mol. Cell.

Recently, another protein was characterized (HSBP-1) which negatively affects HSF-1 activity (59Satyal S.H. Chen D. Fox S.G. Kramer J.M. Morimoto R.I. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1962-1974Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). These repressors thus represent candidates whose inhibitory influence may prevent activation of heat shock gene expression after oxidative stress.We found no correlation between cytotoxic effects of OS and HS and the degree of hsp68 induction. OS-induced hsp68expression was observed only at high doses of hydrogen peroxide and at a degree of cytotoxicity which suppressed hsp68 expression when caused by HS. Mitochondrial dehydrogenase activity was strongly inhibited by OS as indicated by the MTT assay (44Berg K. Hansen M.B. Nielsen S.E. APMIS. 1990; 98: 156-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) which is consistent with a significant damage of mitochondria as demonstrated by electron microscopy.3 The strong inhibition of protein synthesis by OS may be due to the impairment of the elongation factor-2 (EF-2) (60Ayala A. Parrado J. Bougria M. Machado A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23105-23110Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) as well as to a depletion of ATP (61Huang J. Philbert M.A. Brain Res. 1996; 711: 184-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Inspite of the fact that translation of stress proteins seems to be less sensitive to stress compared with the synthesis of other proteins (2Morimoto, R. I., Tissieres, A., and Georgopoulos, C. (eds) (1994) The Biology of Heat Shock Proteins and Molecular Chaperones, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, Plainview, NYGoogle Scholar), the strong toxic effects of OS on the protein synthesis machinery may explain at least the delayed kinetics of hsp68 expression. In addition, an earlier increase of Hsp68 may be prevented by unknown factors (for example, constitutive HSE binding factor, HSBP-1, or EF-2) which may inhibit the inducing signal or strengthen the influence of these inhibitory factors and thus limit or even close the window forhsp68 induction. The OS-induced cytotoxicity correlated strongly with lipid peroxidation which causes perturbation of ion homeostasis (e.g. increase of intracellular Ca2+) and subsequently activates Ca2+-dependent phospholipases, proteases, endonucleases, NO synthetase, and xanthin oxidase (39Halliwell B. Gutteridge J.M.C. Biochem. J. 1984; 219: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (4514) Google Scholar, 62Trump B.F. Berezesky I.K. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 219-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (563) Google Scholar).Denatured proteins were hypothesized as signal for HSF-1 activation by means of their binding and sequestering of Hsp70 which is assumed to act as inhibitor of HSF-1 (2Morimoto, R. I., Tissieres, A., and Georgopoulos, C. (eds) (1994) The Biology of Heat Shock Proteins and Molecular Chaperones, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, Plainview, NYGoogle Scholar). A first analysis of lactic dehydrogenase activity which may serve as indicator of cytosolic protein denaturation revealed a stronger suppression by OS compared with HS which may be due to oxidative damage of the active site. In more specific experiments, however, we observed stronger exposure of hydrophobic domains in response to HS (44 °C) compared with OS (up to 8 mmH2O2) as demonstrated by ANS fluorescence analysis. Binding of ANS identifies molten globule intermediate states which are converted from the native state under denaturating conditions (48Ptisyn O.B. Pain R.H. Semisotnov G.V. Zerovnik E. Razgulyaev O.I. FEBS Lett. 1990; 262: 20-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (666) Google Scholar). The fairly compact molten globules display significant native-like secondary structures, but increased exposure of hydrophobic surfaces and a lack of rigid tertiary structure compared with the native protein (49Christensen H. Pain R.H. Eur. Biophys. J. 1991; 19: 221-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar, 63Creighton T.E. Biochem. J. 1990; 270: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar). Consistent with our results it was postulated recently that the molten globule intermediate, which is prone to aggregate may represent the critical parameter for the heat shock response (64Freeman M.L. Borrelli M.J. Meredith M.J. Lepock J.R. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1999; 26: 737-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). While HS may cause a direct conversion to a molten globule state (65Senisterra G.A. Huntley S.A. Escaravage M. Sekhar K.R. Freeman M.L. Borrelli M. Lepock J.R. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 11002-11011Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), OS may induce protein destabilization due to fragmentation and formation of non-native disulfide bonds which secondarily result in a transition to molten globule intermediates (63Creighton T.E. Biochem. J. 1990; 270: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar,66Stadtman E.R. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1993; 62: 797-821Crossref PubMed Scopus (1253) Google Scholar, 67Weiner L. Kreimer D.

Morrow J.D. Freeman M.L. J. Cell. Physiol. 1997; 171: 143-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar).LDH hydrophobicity caused by HS (44 °C) corresponded to an exposure of hydrophobic domains caused by OS of about 20 mm hydrogen peroxide which does not induce hsp68 due to its letal effects on cells. We hypothesize that hydrogen peroxide on the one hand interrupts the negative feedback control of Hsps on HSF activation due to the increase of hydrophobic domains of cellular proteins. On the other hand, hydrogen peroxide may strongly suppress phosphorylation- or redox-dependent HSF activation due to its strong molecular damaging capacity. In response to low hydrogen peroxide concentrations which hardly causes exposure of hydrophobic domains, induction ofhsp68 may be increased by products of the lipoxygenase pathway (29Gosslau A. Rensing L. Brain Res. 2000; 864: 114-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). As hydrophobicity of LDH increases dose dependently up to high temperatures, the question arises why hsp68 induction by HS is sharply abrogated already by relative nontoxic temperatures (e.g. between 44 and 46 °C), a question that we cannot answer at present.Deoxyspergualin which exhibits strong affinity specifically to Hsp70 and Hsp90 (50Nadler S.G. Tepper M.A. Schacter B. Mazzucco C.E. Science. 1992; 258: 484-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar, 51Nadeau K. Nadler S.G. Saulnier M. Tepper M.A. Walsh C.T. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 2561-2567Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) drastically increased only OS-inducedhsp68 expression in contrast to HS. An HS of 44 °C may saturate the binding of constitutive Hsps such as Hsp70 and Hsp90 to cytosolic proteins due to strong exposure of hydrophobic domains (69Csermely P. Kajtar J. Hollosi M. Jalsovszky G. Holly S. Kahn C.R. Gergely Jr., P. Soti C. Mihaly K. Somogyi J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1901-1907Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,70Richarme G. Kohiyama M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24074-24077Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In response to OS, on the other hand, a lesser exposure of hydrophobic domains may be responsible for a lesser binding of these domains to Hsps which may be compensated by DSG.Our results support the assumption of a common signal as trigger for the induction pathway of hsp68 by HS and OS. Specific hydrophobic interactions between molten globule-like cytosolic proteins and Hsp70 and Hsp90 may interrupt their negative feedback on HSF (19Shi Y. Mosser D.D. Morimoto R.I. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 654-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar,20Zuo J. Guo Y Guettouche T. Smith D.F. Voellmy R. Cell. 1998; 94: 471-480Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (925) Google Scholar). HSF should then convert to a trimer which represents probably a primary step in the activation of the hsp68 gene. Specific phosphorylation- or redox-dependent modifications of the HSF and other transcription factors by HS or OS may be responsible for their different inducing effects on hsp68. Stress proteins, initially termed heat shock proteins (Hsps)1 after the first observation of Ritossa (1Ritossa F.M. Experientia. 1962; 18: 571-573Crossref Scopus (1452) Google Scholar), are induced in response to a wide range of biological and physicochemical stressors, including heat shock (HS) and oxidative stress (1Ritossa F.M. Experientia. 1962; 18: 571-573Crossref Scopus (1452) Google Scholar, 2Morimoto, R. I., Tissieres, A., and Georgopoulos, C. (eds) (1994) The Biology of Heat Shock Proteins and Molecular Chaperones, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, Plainview, NYGoogle Scholar). Prominent stress proteins are represented by members of the Hsp70 family, which consists of constitutive (Hsc70) and inducible isoforms (Hsp68). Hsp68 and Hsc70 act as chaperones and protect the cell by binding to malfolded proteins resulting from exposure to stress, thus preventing their aggregation and either helping these proteins to refold to their active state or targeting them to lysosomes for protein degradation (2Morimoto, R. I., Tissieres, A., and Georgopoulos, C. (eds) (1994) The Biology of Heat Shock Proteins and Molecular Chaperones, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, Plainview, NYGoogle Scholar, 3DeMaio A. Shock. 1999; 11: 1-12Crossref Scopus (496) Google Scholar). Activation of hsp68 seems to be predominantly regulated by the heat shock transcription factor (HSF-1) which binds to heat shock elements (HSEs) in the hsp68 promoter (4Wu C. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1995; 11: 441-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (963) Google Scholar). HSF-1 is apparently regulated by trimerization, phosphorylation, redox modification, and compartmentation (4Wu C. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1995; 11: 441-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (963) Google Scholar, 5Huang L.E. Zhang H. Bae S.W. Liu A.Y.C. J. Biol.

A. 1999; 96: 6769-6774Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Together with the expression of isoforms (7Goodson M.L. Sarge K.D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 211: 943-949Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) these results suggest a multistep regulation of HSF (8Zuo J. Rungger D. Voellmy R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4319-4330Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar,9Chen H.W. Chou F.P. Lue S.I. Yang R.C. Shock. 1999; 12: 63-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). In addition to HSE, the hsp68 promoter contains binding sites for nuclear factor κB (NFκB) which is strongly activated by hydrogen peroxide (10Schulze-Osthoff K. Los M. Baeuerle A. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1995; 50: 735-741Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). Other transcription factors such as signal transducers and activators of transcription, transcription factor IID, Sp-1, and CCAAT-box binding factor may also influence the induction of hsp68 (11Williams G.T. Morimoto R.I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 3125-3136Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 12Hung J.J. Cheng T.J. Chang M.D. Chen K.D. Huang H.L. Lai Y.K. J. Cell.

The differential activation of these and other factors by HS and OS and their interplay may ultimately cause a differential induction of hsp68. It is still unclear whether the activation of the hsp68 gene by the great diversity of stressors depends on a common signal pathway. Initially, it was speculated that abnormal proteins may trigger HSF activation (14Munro S. Pelham H. Nature. 1985; 317: 477-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 15Anathan J. Goldberg A.L. Voellmy R. Science. 1986; 232: 522-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (692) Google Scholar). Later, it was demonstrated that Hsp70 forms a complex with HSF and that excess Hsp70 suppress HSF activation (16Abravaya K. Meyers M.P. Murphy S.P. Morimoto R.I. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 1153-1164Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar, 17Mosser D.D. Duchaine J. Massie B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 5427-5428Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 18Baler R. Zou J. Voellmy R. Cell Stress Chaperones. 1996; 1: 33-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). It was hypothesized, therefore, that denatured proteins reduce the concentration of free Hsp70 by complex formation. This decrease of free Hsps relieves their inhibitory action on the HSF which can subsequently convert from the monomeric, non-DNA binding form into the trimeric active form (2Morimoto, R. I., Tissieres,"

Derivatives of this peptide in which the P2 leucine or the P2‘ valine were replaced with other residues were used to probe the subsite specificity of the enzyme. Varying the P2 residue produced a 4-fold range in Km and a 7-fold range in kcat. The nature of the P2 residue had a significant effect on the site of cleavage. Leucine, isoleucine, valine, and aspartate produced cleavage at the R–K bond. Asparagine produced 36% cleavage at the N–R bond and 64% cleavage at the R–K bond, whereas with alanine or serine the A–R and S–R bonds were the major cleavage sites. With tyrosine, phenylalanine, methionine, or histidine representing the varied residue X, cleavages at F–X, X–R, and R–K were seen, whereas with tryptophan equal cleavage occurred at the F–W and W–R bonds. Variable P2‘ residues produce less of a change in both Km and kcat and have little influence on the cleavage site. Exceptions are phenylalanine, tyrosine, leucine, and isoleucine, which in addition to producing cleavage at the R–K bond, produce significant cleavage at the L–R bond. Alanine and tyrosine were unique in producing cleavage at the F–L bond. Taken together, these data suggest that insulysin specificity is directed toward the amino side of hydrophobic and basic residues and that the enzyme has an extended substrate binding site.

Although insulysin has the highest affinity for insulin, the enzyme has been shown to cleave a number of other physiological peptides in vitro including glucagon (6Authier F. Posner B.I. Bergeron J.J.M. Clin. Invest. Med. 1996; 19: 149-160PubMed Google Scholar), insulin-like growth factors I and II (7Roth R.A. Mesirow M.L. Yokono K. Baba S. Endocr.

Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 1301-1307Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The finding of a variety of substrates for the enzyme, as well as its presence at high levels in insulin-insensitive cells, suggest that insulysin has a variety of physiological functions. Those proposed include processing of insulin for antigen recognition (10Semple J.W. Ellis J. Delovitch T.L. J. Immunol. 1989; 142: 4184-4193PubMed Google Scholar), regulation of the multicatalytic proteinase (11Duckworth W.C. Robert G.B. Hamel F.G. J. Biol.

Chem. 1994; 269: 20622-20628Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Insulysin was shown to be identical to an enzymatic activity referred to as γ-endorphin-generating enzyme, an enzyme that converts β-endorphin to γ-endorphin (β−endorphin 1–17) and β−endorphin 1–18 (13Safavi A. Miller B.C. Cottam L. Hersh L.B. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 14318-14325Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). In that study GRF, dynorphin B 1–13, dynorphin A 1–17, and pancreastatin 1–49 were shown also to be substrates. Recent interest in insulysin stems from its ability to degrade the amyloid peptides Aβ 1−40 and Aβ 1–42 (5Qiu W.Q. Walsh D.M. Ye Z. Vekrellis K. Zhang J. Podlisny M.B. Rosner M.R. Safavi A.

Decreases in insulysin activity in the brains of Alzheimer's patients have been suggested to contribute to the progression of this disease (17Perez A. Morekki L. Cresto J.C. Castano E.M. Neurochem. Res. 2000; 25: 247-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). Insulysin is a 110-kDa zinc metallopeptidase member of the invercinzin family of proteases, characterized by an inverted active site motif, H XXEH, relative to the more common HE XXH motif. The two histidines in this motif are ligands for the active site zinc atom, and the glutamate serves either as a nucleophile attacking the susceptible peptide bond or more likely as a general acid catalyst facilitating the attack of a water molecule on the scissile bond (18Perlman R.K. Gehm B.D. Kuo W.-L. Rosner M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21538-21544Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The functionality of these three residues has been established by site-directed mutagenesis (18Perlman R.K. Gehm B.D. Kuo W.-L. Rosner M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21538-21544Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Perlman R.K. Rosner M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 33140-33145Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Gehm B.D. Kuo W.-L. Perlman R.K. Rosner M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7943-7948Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The specificity of insulysin toward peptide bond cleavage is complex and not fully understood. Authier et al. (6Authier F. Posner B.I. Bergeron J.J.M. Clin. Invest. Med. 1996; 19: 149-160PubMed Google Scholar) examined the cleavage sites in a variety of peptides and concluded that the enzyme exhibited a preference for basic (arginine) or large hydrophobic (phenylalanine, leucine, tyrosine) amino acids to occupy the carboxyl (P1) side of the cleavage site. We previously conducted a similar analysis of the substrate specificity of the enzyme and also concluded that the enzyme exhibits a preference, but not absolute specificity, for cleavage at hydrophobic and basic residues (13Safavi A. Miller B.C. Cottam L. Hersh L.B. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 14318-14325Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). However, we suggested that the specificity of insulysin is directed at the amino side (P1′) rather than the carboxyl side (P1) of the bond cleaved. It has also been proposed that the specificity of the enzyme is governed by the three-dimensional structure of the substrate (2Duckworth W.C. Bennett R.G. Hamel F.G. Endocr. Rev. 1998; 19: 608-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (666) Google Scholar). This is not inconsistent with the specificity being directed at basic and hydrophobic residues, because it has been observed that substrates bind in an extended β-like structure to many proteases. In this study we have introduced the use of internally quenched fluorogenic peptides as substrates for insulysin. We have used these peptides to further probe the specificity of the enzyme. The results indicate the importance of subsite interactions in determining cleavage sites and further support the suggestion that insulysin specificity is directed at the amino side of hydrophobic and basic residues.

Commun. 1997; 231: 167-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), kindly provided by Dr. Richard Roth of Stanford University, was subcloned into the pFASTBAC vector (Life Technologies, Inc.) using BamHI and XhoI restriction sites such that a His6 affinity tag became fused to the N terminus of the protein. The insulysin portion of the fusion protein started at methionine 42, which corresponds to the second putative start site in the coding region. This latter site is believed to be the one utilized in vivo (21Baumeister H. Muller D. Rehbein M. Richter D. FEBS Lett. 1993; 317: 350-354Crossref Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Generation of recombinant baculovirus and expression of recombinant insulysin in Sf9 cells were done according to the manufacturer's instructions. For the purification of recombinant insulysin, a 1:10 (w/v) suspension of Sf9 cells expressing the enzyme was prepared in 100 mmpotassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.3, containing 1 mmdithiothreitol (K-PO4/dithioerythritol buffer). The cells were sonicated using a Branson sonifier (setting 3 at 30%) 10 times, each time for 1 s. The sonicate was centrifuged at 75,000 × g for 20 min to pellet the membrane fraction, and the supernatant containing insulysin was loaded onto a 5-ml nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid column (Qiagen) that had been equilibrated with the K-PO4/dithioerythritol buffer. After extensive washing of the column with starting buffer and then with 20 mm imidazole buffer, pH 7.3, the enzyme was eluted with 500 mm imidazole buffer, pH 7.3. From a 100-ml culture ∼2 mg of purified enzyme was obtained. The purified enzyme was essentially homogeneous as judged by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (Fig.1). During purification, the activity of insulysin was assayed by measuring the disappearance of β-endorphin using reverse phase HPLC as described previously (13Safavi A. Miller B.C. Cottam L. Hersh L.B. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 14318-14325Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), except that isocratic elution was employed. A 100-μl reaction mixture containing 40 mmpotassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.3, 30 μm β-endorphin, and enzyme was incubated for 15 min at 37 °C. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 10 μl of 5.5% trifluoroacetic acid, producing a final concentration of 0.5%. The reaction mixture was loaded onto a C4 reverse phase HPLC column (Vydac, Hisperia, CA) and separated isocratically at 32% acetonitrile in 0.1% aqueous trifluoroacetic acid. The β−endorphin, which eluted at ∼8 min, was detected by absorbance at 214 nm using a Waters detector and quantitated from its peak area. The reaction of fluorogenic substrates containing an N-terminal 2-aminobenzyl (Abz) group and a C-terminal ethylenediamine-2,4-dinitrophenyl group (EDDnp) was measured by the increase in fluorescence that occurs upon cleavage of any peptide bond and the separation of the quenching EDDnp group from the fluorescent Abz group. Peptides were synthesized and purified by HPLC as described previously (22Csuhai E. Juliano M.A. Pyrek J.S. Harms A.C. Juliano L. Hersh L.B. Anal. Biochem. 1999; 269: 149-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) and prepared as 1 mm stock solutions in 20% dimethylformamide. The peptide concentration was calculated from the absorbance at 357 nm (ε = 10 mm). Reaction mixtures contained the fluorogenic peptide substrate, insulysin, and 20 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.3. The reaction was initiated by the addition of enzyme and monitored continuously on a Hitachi model F2000 spectrofluorometer equipped with a chart recorder. Excitation and emission wavelengths were 318 and 418 nm, respectively. The relationship between fluorescence change and peptide concentration was determined by measuring the total fluorescence change that occurred upon complete hydrolysis of the peptide with trypsin (22Csuhai E. Juliano M.A. Pyrek J.S. Harms A.C. Juliano L. Hersh L.B. Anal. Biochem. 1999; 269: 149-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Kinetic data were fit to computer programs of Cleland (23Cleland W.W. Methods Enzymol. 1979; 63: 103-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (1924) Google Scholar). Reaction mixtures containing 40 μm fluorogenic peptide were allowed to react for varying time periods and stopped as noted above. The reaction mixture was then subjected to HPLC using a gradient of 5% acetonitrile in 0.1% aqueous trifluoroacetic acid to 50% acetonitrile in 0.1% aqueous trifluoroacetic acid. Product peaks were either collected and identified by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time of flight mass spectrometry or by comparison of the retention times of products to those of previously identified peptides. In some cases product identification was verified by mixing a known product with the unknown and demonstrating co-chromatography in the HPLC gradient system. Insulysin activity has generally been assayed with iodinated insulin as substrate. This assay involves reaction of the enzyme with this substrate, followed by precipitation of unreacted insulin with trichloroacetic acid and subsequent measurement of the radiolabeled products in the supernatant. Although this assay is rather sensitive, it has several disadvantages. It is cumbersome, the products formed are not determined during the reaction, it requires several cleavages of the insulin molecule to release soluble products, it is a discontinuous assay, and it requires handling radioactive material. An alternative assay was developed (13Safavi A. Miller B.C. Cottam L. Hersh L.B. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 14318-14325Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) in which the disappearance of another insulysin substrate, β-endorphin, is measured by HPLC. This assay has the advantage that it does not require a radioactive substrate, but it has the disadvantages that it is also a discontinuous assay, it follows substrate disappearance rather than product appearance, and it requires ∼1 h for each HPLC run. In this study the use of an isocratic system rather than a gradient system to follow β-endorphin disappearance reduced the assay time from over an hour to less than 10 min. In an attempt to develop a simpler continuous assay for the enzyme, we tested as a substrate the internally quenched fluorogenic peptide Abz-GGFLRKVGQ-EDDnp, which contains a central core of both hydrophobic and basic residues, which are cleavage sites in the substrates β-endorphin and insulin. Cleavage of any peptide bond in this substrate produces an increase in fluorescence as the quenching of the N-terminal fluorescent Abz group by the C-terminal EDDnp group is relieved (24Chagas J.R. Juliano L. Prado E. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 192: 419-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 25Gershkovich A.A. Kholodovych V.V. J. Biochem. Biophys. Methods. 1996; 33: 135-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). We found this peptide to be cleaved by purified recombinant insulysin, yielding a Km of 21 μm and a Vmax of ∼0.2 μmol min−1 mg−1 of enzyme. This can be compared with β-endorphin, which exhibits a Km of 13 μm and a Vmax of 2.6 μmol min−1 mg−1. Cleavage of Abz-GGFLRKVGQ-EDDnp occurred at a single site, the R–K bond (Fig.2). The ability to use quenched fluorogenic peptides as substrates for insulysin permitted an assessment of the effect of varying the amino acid residue at specific positions on the hydrolysis of peptides by this enzyme. Shown in Table I is the effect of varying amino acids in the P2position. 2The nomenclature of Schechter and Berger (26Schechter I. Berger A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1967; 27: 157-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (4693) Google Scholar) is used in which the residue on the carboxyl side of the bond being cleaved is designated as the P1 residue, and the residue on the amino side of the bond being cleaved is designated as the P1′ residue. Subsequent residues are designated P2′, P3′, P2, P3, etc. With the fluorogenic peptides used in this study, a number of them are cleaved at multiple positions. For simplicity and based on the parent peptide Abz-GGFLRKVGQ-EDDnp, which is cleaved at the R-K bond, we refer to the R residue as the P1 residue and the K residue as the P1′ residue. It can be seen that variable P2 residues affect the apparent kcat, with a 7-fold variation in this parameter observed, whereas Km varies less than 4-fold; and changes in kcat/Km more or less parallel kcat. As shown in Table I and exemplified in Fig. 2, there is a rather profound effect of the P2 residue on the site of bond cleavage. With the aliphatic residues leucine, isoleucine, valine, and aspartate, cleavage occurs exclusively at the R–K bond. With asparagine, cleavage at the N–R bond is observed about one third of the time, whereas with the small side chains of alanine and serine, the major cleavage sites are the A–R and S–R bonds, respectively. With tyrosine, phenylalanine, methionine, or histidine corresponding to the variable amino acid, three cleavage sites are observed, which are at the F–Xbond, the X–R bond, and the R–K bond. The extent of cleavage at each of these sites is dependent on the particular amino acid residue present. With tryptophan, cleavage at the R–K bond does not occur; however, cleavage is seen at the F–W and W–R bonds at about equal frequency. It should be noted that product analysis revealed only the intact N- and C-terminal fragments resulting from the indicated cleavage sites. No fragments corresponding to secondary cleavages were observed.Table IEffect of variable P 2 residues on the kinetics of hydrolysis of the peptide series Abz-GGFXRKVGQ-EDDnp by rat insulysin at pH 7.3XkcatappKmkcat/KmRelative cleavage at F↓X:X↓R:R↓Kmin −1μmm −1 min −1 × 10 −7Tyr21.87 ± 1.8218.17 ± 2.0612.0 ± 0.460:25:15Phe20.13 ± 3.5326.5 ± 5.857.6 ± 0.432:60:8Leu18.32 ± 2.5421.32 ± 3.898.6 ± 0.40:0:100Trp14.37 ± 1.9215.26 ± 2.879.4 ± 0.253:47:0Met9.37 ± 1.4418.62 ± 3.845.0 ± 0.335:14:51His6.75 ± 0.6715.75 ± 2.24.3 ± 0.240:24:36Asn6.44 ± 0.9011.13 ± 2.255.9 ± 0.40:36:64Ala5.63 ± 0.5914.6 ± 2.173.9 ± 0.20:70:30Asp4.55 ± 0.5121.38 ± 3.182.1 ± 0.10:0:100Ile4.41 ± 0.6215.44 ± 3.062.8 ± 0.20:0:100Ser3.78 ± 0.238.27 ± 0.844.6 ± 0.20:65:35Val3.04 ± 0.257.00 ± 1.024.3 ± 0.30:0:100Kinetic constants are reported along with their standard errors. Open table in a new tab Kinetic constants are reported along with their standard errors. These data indicate that there are multiple alignments permitted for substrate binding. Subsite interactions between the enzyme and the substrate govern these alignments, which in turn determine which bond is cleaved. Within the sequences tested, the bulky hydrophobic amino acids leucine, isoleucine, and valine, as well as aspartate, appear to be accommodated only as a P2 residue leading to cleavage exclusively at the R–K bond. Leucine produces the highest kcat value when acting as a P2residue (Table II). At the other extreme, tryptophan does not appear to occupy the P2 position. Two nonexclusive explanations that can account for this observation are possible. Tryptophan may fit poorly into the S2 subsite of the enzyme. Additionally, tryptophan may be favored as both a P1 and P1′ residue and thus within the sequence FWRKV cleavages at F–W or W–R occur much faster than at the R–K bond. All other residues examined appear to be capable of occupying the P2 position but have a relatively small influence on the rate of cleavage at the R–K bond (Table II). This suggests that there is no correlation between cleavage at a particular bond and kcat.Table IIEffect of variable P 1 residues on the k cat for specific cleavagesP1residuekcattotalkcatF↓Xkcat X↓Rkcat R↓Kmin −1min −1min −1min −1Tyr21.87 ± 1.8213.125.473.28Leu18.32 ± 2.540018.32Phe20.13 ± 3.536.4412.071.61Asn6.44 ± 0.9002.324.12Met9.37 ± 1.443.281.314.78Ser3.78 ± 0.2302.451.32Trp14.37 ± 1.927.636.750His6.75 ± 0.672.701.622.43Val3.04 ± 0.25003.04Ala5.63 ± 0.5903.941.69Ile4.41 ± 0.62004.41Asp4.55 ± 0.51004.55The kcat values for cleavage at specific sites were calculated from the data in Table I. Open table in a new tab The kcat values for cleavage at specific sites were calculated from the data in Table I. As shown in Tables I and II, within the sequence F XRKV, where X is the variable amino acid, only a limited number of residues were found to serve as P1′ residues. These were the aromatic amino acids and methionine. Of these, tyrosine produces the highest kcat for cleavage at the F–X bond. Within this varied sequence, the enzyme accepts a variety of amino acids as P1 residues, with the rate of cleavage exhibiting an ∼10-fold variation dependent on the specific residue occupying this position. Leucine, valine, isoleucine, and aspartate, although not found as P1 residues, were found as P2 residues. The variety of amino acid types that can occupy the P1 position and the observation that insulysin appears to favor cleavage at hydrophobic and basic residues (6Authier F. Posner B.I. Bergeron J.J.M. Clin. Invest. Med. 1996; 19: 149-160PubMed Google Scholar, 13Safavi A. Miller B.C. Cottam L. Hersh L.B. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 14318-14325Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) make it less likely that insulysin specificity is directed at the P1 residue. The effect of varying the P2′ residue is shown in TableIII. With the exception of aspartate, which is the least favored residue in the P2′ position, there is less than a 5-fold effect of variable P2′ residues on the apparent kcat, whereas Km varies only ∼3-fold. When one considers the rates for cleavage specifically at the R–K bond, excluding aspartate, an ∼8-fold range of kcat values becomes evident. Histidine and serine are the preferred residues at this site, with no obvious pattern of discrimination among other types of side chains. There is also an effect of the P2′ residue on the site of cleavage. The aromatic amino acids phenylalanine and tyrosine and the hydrophobic amino acids leucine and isoleucine produce significant cleavage at the L–R bond and thus act as P3′ residues. Alanine, but not serine, and to a lesser extent tyrosine produce cleavage at the F–L bond, placing these residues in the P4′ position. These data indicate that insulysin contains an extended active site, with residues in the S2′, S3′, and S4′ subsites contributing to specificity.Table IIIEffect of variable P 2 ′ residues on the kinetics of hydrolysis of the peptide series Abz-GGFLRKXGQ-EDDnp by rat insulysin at pH 7.3XkcatKmkcat/KmRelative cleavage at F↓L:L↓R:R↓Kmin −1μmm −1 min −1 × 10 −7His48.03 ± 4.1210.05 ± 1.3847.8 ± 2.60:0:100Ser25.13 ± 3.6410.29 ± 2.3724.4 ± 2.20:0:100Phe21.47 ± 2.8612.79 ± 2.5416.8 ± 1.20:56:54Tyr20.37 ± 2.577.90 ± 1.6725.8 ± 2.56:51:43Ala20.10 ± 2.0211.44 ± 1.7717.6 ± 1.032:0:68Val18.32 ± 2.5421.32 ± 3.898.6 ± 0.40:0:100Leu15.91 ± 1.4022.69 ± 2.587.0 ± 0.20:25:75Met15.35 ± 1.518.52 ± 1.3018.0 ± 1.10:0:100Asn13.76 ± 1.087.29 ± 0.9918.9 ± 1.20:0:100Ile10.64 ± 1.3313.48 ± 2.497.9 ± 0.50:44:56Asp3.41 ± 0.207.31 ± 0.764.7 ± 0.20:0:100Kinetic constants are reported along with their standard errors. Open table in a new tab Kinetic constants are reported along with their standard errors. The effects seen by P2′ residues differ from those seen with P2 residues because none of the P2′ residues serve as cleavage sites. However, these residues can influence the cleavage site. There are a number of possible explanations for this, the simplest being that lysine is a poor P1 residue. The rate enhancements produced by P2′ residues on cleavage at the R–K bond probably result from increased binding energy produced through distal subsite interactions. Those residues that produce additional cleavage sites probably destabilize interactions at the S2 subsite and/or produce favorable interactions at the S3 subsite. The data in Tables II and III also provide insight into the rate-determining step of the reaction. Because the insulysin reaction involves the conversion of a single substrate into two products, there are three potential rate-determining steps. These are the release of the N-terminal fragment of the substrate, the release of the C-terminal fragment of the substrate, or cleavage of the peptide bond. As seen in Table II, with Abz-GGF XRKVGQ-EDDnp as substrate, variable amino acids in the N-terminal portion of the substrate produce a greater than 7-fold variation in kcat when one considers formation of the common C-terminal product RKVGQ-EDDnp. Similarly, a 14-fold variation for formation of the common C-terminal product KVGQ-EDDnp is seen. If release of these C-terminal fragments were rate-limiting, these products would all exhibit the same kcat. Similarly, the data in Table III show a greater than 9-fold variation for release of the common N-terminal product Abz-GGFLR when the amino acid in the C-terminal part of the substrate is varied. These data indicate that release of the N-terminal fragment is also not the rate-limiting step. One is left to conclude that the cleavage of the peptide bond is the rate-limiting step of the reaction, at least with the peptides used in this study. Together, the data support our previous proposal (13Safavi A. Miller B.C. Cottam L. Hersh L.B. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 14318-14325Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) that insulysin prefers to cleave at hydrophobic (preferably aromatic hydrophobic) residues and basic residues. The data further suggest that the specificity of insulysin is directed toward the amino side of these residues. Multiple subsite interactions are possible, permitting different alignments of the substrate relative to the catalytic site. These interactions determine the site of bond cleavage and to a lesser extent the rate of bond cleavage. Together these factors provide insights into the complex cleavage pattern observed when insulysin acts on physiological substrates. We thank Dr. Richard Roth of Stanford University for providing us with the cDNA clone to rat insulysin."

Five DsbC mutants with Cys in the active site sequence of Cys98-Gly-Tyr-Cys101 and the nonactive site disulfide Cys141-Cys163 replaced by Ser have been studied. The results show that the active site Cys residues are necessary for enzyme activities but not required for chaperone activity, while the lack of the nonactive site disulfide results in a decreased chaperone activity in assisting the reactivation of denaturedd-glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase but has no effect on enzyme activities. Wild-type DsbC was overexpressed and correctly processed as a soluble periplasmic protein. Mutation in one of these Cys residues results in aggregation or extracellular/membrane locations, but does not affect the proper processing. DsbC mutated in either Cys residue of nonactive site disulfide shows higher sensitivity to unfolding by guanidine hydrochloride and slower refolding compared with wild-type DsbC and the active site Cys mutants.

PDI has been characterized to be not only an isomerase but also a chaperone (9Cai H. Wang C.C. Tsou C.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24550-24552Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Yao Y. Zhou Y.C. Wang C.C. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 651-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Recently we have reported that DsbC shows even more pronounced chaperone activity than PDI in promoting the in vitro reactivation and suppressing aggregation of denatured d-glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) during refolding (11Chen J. Song J.L. Zhang S. Wang Y. Cui D.F. Wang C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19601-19605Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar), whereas DsbA shows a weaker chaperone activity than that of PDI (12Zheng W.D. Quan H. Song J.L. Yang S.L. Wang C.C. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 337: 326-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). DsbG, strongly homologous to DsbC, has also been characterized to have chaperone activity (13Shao F. Bader M.W. Jakob U. Bardwell J.C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 13349-13352Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). The crystal structure of DsbC reveals that it is a V-shaped molecule with each arm of the V, a monomer consisting of a C-terminal thioredoxin-domain and a N-terminal association domain connected by a hinged linker (14McMarthy A.A. Haebel P.W. Torronen A. Rybin V. Baker E. Metcalf P. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 196-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). DsbC has four cysteines in each 23-kDa subunit. Two in the active site (Cys98-Gly-Tyr-Cys101) with Cys98protruded out of the molecule are responsible for the oxidoreductase activity (6Zapun A. Missiakas D. Raina E. Creighton T.E. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 5075-5089Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). Single replacements of Cys98 with different residues all result in complete loss of enzyme activities; however, the contributions of Cys101 to the biological activities were reported diversely (5Missiakas D. Georgopoulos C. Raina S. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2013-2020Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar, 15Rietsch A. Bessette P. Georgiou G. Beckwith J. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 6602-6608Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). The nonactive site cysteines, Cys141 and Cys163, were reported to form a stable disulfide bond somehow buried and disrupted only in the presence of large excess of dithiothreitol (DTT) (6Zapun A. Missiakas D. Raina E. Creighton T.E. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 5075-5089Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar, 16Joly J.C. Swartz J.R. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 10067-10072Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Among the members of the thioredoxin superfamily characterized so far, only DsbC has a nonactive site disulfide bond, Cys141-Cys163, which was suggested to play a purely structural role (6Zapun A. Missiakas D. Raina E. Creighton T.E. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 5075-5089Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar, 17Frishman D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 219: 686-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Recent crystal structure analysis shows that this unique disulfide bond located in a helical insert within the C-terminal catalytic domain is partially solvent exposed (14McMarthy A.A. Haebel P.W. Torronen A. Rybin V. Baker E. Metcalf P. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 196-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). DsbC, like other oxidoreductases, exists in both oxidized and reduced forms. Reduced DsbC is the functional and dominating form (8Rietsch A. Belin D. Martin N. Beckwith J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Overexpression of DsbC results in the accumulation of oxidized form due to exceeding the reductive capacity of DsbD (15Rietsch A. Bessette P. Georgiou G. Beckwith J. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 6602-6608Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Unlike DsbA (20Wunderlich M. Glockshuber R. Protein Sci. 1993; 2: 717-726Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar), reduced and oxidized DsbC show the same intrinsic fluorescence and CD spectra (6Zapun A. Missiakas D. Raina E. Creighton T.E. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 5075-5089Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). In this paper we report that five DsbC mutants, with Cys replaced by Ser, overproduced in Escherichia coli using a His-tagged signal to direct export as described in our previous work (21Liu X.Q. Zhang S. Pan X.M. Wang C.C. Protein Sci. 1999; 8: 2085-2089Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar), show different properties in terms of folding, export, solubility, stability, and biological activities compared with wild-type DsbC. Primers designed for mutations of Cys at the positions of 98, 101, 141, and 163 of DsbC into Ser are listed in TableI. The plasmid BS-DsbC was constructed by insertion of the coding sequence of DsbC precursor amplified from the plasmid pDsbC, a generous gift from Dr. Rudi Glockshuber (Eidenössische Technische Hochschule, Hönggerberg, Switzerland), into Bluescript II/SK(+) (Stratagene) as described previously (21Liu X.Q. Zhang S. Pan X.M. Wang C.C. Protein Sci. 1999; 8: 2085-2089Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). The preparation of single-stranded DNA of BS-DsbC and oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis in vitro were performed essentially according to Carter (22Carter P. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 154: 383-403Google Scholar). The full-length coding sequences of the corresponding precursors of the five mutants were confirmed with both strands, and then subcloned into pQE-30 vector (Qiagen) via BamHI site to create corresponding expression plasmids pQE-C98S, pQE-C98S/C101S, pQE-C101S/C163S, pQE-C141S, and pQE-C163S according to Liu et al.

The overnight culture was diluted 100-fold and incubated at 37 °C for 2 h followed by induction with isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) of different concentrations from 0.001 mm to 1 mm. Osmotic shock was used to release soluble periplasmic proteins, and the shocked cells were sonicated and centrifuged at 35000 rpm for 90 min at 4 °C. The pellets were treated with 1% Triton X-100 in 50 mm Tris buffer (pH 8.0) to release membrane-bound proteins. Proteins obtained at each step were analyzed by SDS-PAGE (12%). β-Lactamase (23Samuni A. Anal. Biochem. 1975; 63: 17-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 24Thorstenson Y.R. Zhang Y.

Biochemistry. 1967; 6: 730-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) were used as markers to assign subcellular-compartments of periplasm, inner membrane, and cytoplasm of M15[REP4] cells transformed with plasmid pQE-30, respectively. Processed species of wild-type DsbC prepared from the cells harboring pQE-DsbC (21Liu X.Q. Zhang S. Pan X.M. Wang C.C. Protein Sci. 1999; 8: 2085-2089Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar) showed two peaks on a Q-Sepharose Fast Flow column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). According to free thiol determination (26Riddles P.W. Blakeley R.L. Zerner B. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 91: 49-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (1068) Google Scholar) and native-PAGE analysis (6Zapun A. Missiakas D. Raina E. Creighton T.E. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 5075-5089Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar) of the S-carboxymethylated products, the first eluted peak has been characterized to be oxidized DsbC dimer and the second to be a mixture of oxidized dimer, heterodimer of oxidized and reduced subunit and reduced dimer. The oxidized DsbC dimer was used as a control in all experiments if not specified otherwise. Induction by 0.01 mm IPTG for 6 h at 37 °C was used for preparation of processed species. Osmotic shock was used to release periplasmic soluble C98S. To prepare C141S, C163S, and C101S/C163S from aggregates, the osmotically shocked cells were washed with 1% Triton X-100 followed by treatment with 8 m urea and 0.5% SDS in 50 mm Tris buffer (pH 8.0) at room temperature for 4 h, and the denatured proteins were renatured by thorough dialysis against the same Tris buffer. For extracellular C98S/C101S, the overnight culture was diluted only 1-fold and induced with 0.01 mm IPTG at 37 °C overnight. The cell-free culture was fractionated with 25% and then 100% saturated (NH4)2SO4. Proteins obtained as indicated above were further purified by successive chromatography on Q-Sepharose Fast Flow and Superose 12 HR 10/30 columns (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). All the purified proteins were examined by SDS-PAGE (12%) followed by Western blot. Antiserum was prepared from a New Zealand rabbit immunized with a mixture of DsbC and the five mutants extracted from SDS-PAGE gels. Cells harboring pQE-C98S, pQE-C101S/C163S, pQE-C141S, or pQE-C163S were induced with 0.01 mm IPTG at 37 °C for 6 h. The osmotically shocked cells prepared from 1.5 ml of cell culture was suspended in 0.4 ml 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) with 5 mmCaCl2 and incubated with 0.02 mg/ml proteinase K (Merck) at 25 °C for 1 h. The reaction was stopped by 0.174 mg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and analyzed by SDS-PAGE (15%) and Western blot. Proteins were denatured in 0.1 m Tris buffer (pH 7.5) containing different concentration of guanidine hydrochloride (GdnHCl) overnight at room temperature and the values of ellipticity at 222 nm ([θ]222) were determined. Refolding of fully denatured proteins prepared by incubation with 6m GdnHCl overnight at room temperature in the presence or absence of 0.2 m DTT was initiated by dilution 100-fold into 0.1 m Tris buffer (pH 7.5) and monitored immediately at 25 °C by measuring the fluorescence emission intensity at 312 nm with an excitation at 280 nm. The N-terminal amino acid sequences of purified mutant proteins were determined on a MilliGen/Biosearch model 660 ProSequencer linked to a Waters HPLC system (Franklin) with simultaneous detection at 269 and 313 nm. Protein concentrations were determined by the method of Bradford (27Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216440) Google Scholar). DsbC, S-carboxymethylated DsbC, and DsbC mutants were all considered as protomers in the calculations of molar ratios. Enzymatic activities were assayed according to oxidative refolding of reduced and denatured RNase A (28Akiyama Y. Kamitani S. Kusukawa N. Ito K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 22440-22445Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and reduction of insulin (5Missiakas D. Georgopoulos C. Raina S. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2013-2020Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar, 29Galisteo E.M. Paelilla C.A. Alfonso C.G. Barea J.L. Bárcena J.A. Biochemie. 1993; 75: 803-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Chaperone activity was determined according to the assisted-reactivation of denatured GAPDH upon dilution (11Chen J. Song J.L. Zhang S. Wang Y. Cui D.F. Wang C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19601-19605Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). To examine the redox state of DsbC overexpressed in the cells cultured in the media complemented with or without reductants, proteins in two eluted peaks of Q-Sepharose Fast Flow column were mixed and then S-carboxymethylated by iodoacetic acid (6Zapun A. Missiakas D. Raina E. Creighton T.E. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 5075-5089Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). The reaction mixture after desalting was analyzed by 6% native PAGE (6Zapun A. Missiakas D. Raina E. Creighton T.E. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 5075-5089Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). A hybridized product of DsbC and S-carboxymethylated DsbC was used to mark the net negative charge of 0, 2, and 4 (6Zapun A. Missiakas D. Raina E. Creighton T.E. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 5075-5089Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). CD spectra from 200 to 250 nm were determined with a Jasco 720 spectropolarimeter at 25 °C. Intrinsic and 8-anilino-1-naphthalenesulfonic acid fluorescence spectra were measured in a Shimadzu RF-5301PC spectrofluorometer at 25 °C with 280 and 373 nm for excitation, respectively. As shown in Fig. 1, precursors and processed species of wild-type DsbC and mutants move with significantly different mobility in SDS-PAGE (12%). Induced with IPTG at low concentrations of 0.001 and 0.01 mm, all proteins were efficiently processed, and higher concentrations of IPTG (≥0.1 mm) resulted in the accumulation of unprocessed species. Wild-type DsbC was overexpressed in the periplasm as a soluble protein, consisting 20–30% of the total cellular proteins. C98S/C101S, similar to wild-type DsbC, appeared in the periplasm as a soluble protein when induced for 4 h, but all secreted or leaked into the medium if induced overnight (data not shown). More than 180 mg of processed C98S/C101S was obtained from 1 liter of cell-free culture. Processed species of C98S was partially released by osmotic shock while those of C141S, C163S, and C101S/C163S totally aggregated. Decreasing the yield of synthesis by using 0.001 mm IPTG did not improve the solubility. All five mutants show the same N-terminal sequence of Asp-Asp-Ala as that of wild-type DsbC, confirming that the signal sequences in all mutants have been processed correctly. As shown in Table II, the supernatant (S1) after osmotic shock showed almost all cellular β-lactamase activity, indicating that the proteins in the supernatant fraction prepared by the method of osmotic shock are indeed located in the periplasm. The activities of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase and NADH oxidase mainly appeared in the fractions of sonicated supernatant (S2) and Triton X-100 extract (S3), respectively, indicating that S2 and S3 were mainly from cytoplasm and membranes, respectively. Therefore, as shown in Fig.2 with the optimal induction of 0.01 mm IPTG for 6 h at 37 °C, C98S was expressed partly as a periplasmic soluble protein, partly as a membrane-bound protein, and partly as inclusion bodies in the periplasm. Although C163S and C101S/C163S totally formed inclusion bodies in the periplasm as they appeared only in the pellet of each preparation step, C141S mainly formed inclusion bodies in the periplasm with a small part as a membrane-bound protein.Table IISubcellular compartment marker enzyme activitiesFractionActivity (%)2-aData are expressed as mean ± S.D.

Open table in a new tab M15[REP4] cells transformed with plasmid pQE-30 were fractionated as described in Fig. 2, and the activities of marker enzymes in the fractions of S1, S2, and S3 were determined. As shown in Fig. 3, after digestion with proteinase K, the bands of the mutants C98S, C101S/C163S, C141S, and C163S in the osmotically shocked cells all disappeared and no new bands with lower molecular weight appeared even detected with Western blot, providing further evidence that the insoluble mutants were indeed located in the periplasm and the membrane-bound C98S and C141S were not imbedded inside the membranes but likely peripheral inner membrane proteins toward the periplasm. Many proteins sequestered in aggregates become highly resistant to proteolysis, but this is not the case for C98S, C141S, C163S, and C101S/C163S, suggesting that they are in a protease-accessible conformation. The presence of 5 mm DTT or 10 mm N-acetylcysteine in the culture does not affect the processing, export, solubility, and activity of DsbC (Fig. 4 A and Table III). Under nondenaturing condition, S-carboxymethylated products of DsbC from the strains grown in the media with DTT or N-acetylcysteine showed three bands with net negative charge of 0, 1, and 2, corresponding to the oxidized DsbC, heterodimer of oxidized and reduced subunits, and reduced DsbC, respectively (Fig. 4 B), and showed about 30% of reductase activity of DsbC (Table III). The activity might be contributed by the Cys98 originally in the oxidized form and not alkylated in both oxidized DsbC and oxidized subunit of the heterodimer. The S-carboxymethylated products prepared in the presence of 6 m GdnHCl showed three bands with net negative charge of 0, 2, and 4, respectively, because of the alkylation of Cys101, which was not attacked by iodoacetic acid under nondenaturing condition. The above indicates that the nonactive site cysteines, Cys141 and Cys163, form a disulfide bond even with the cells grown in a reducing culture.Table IIIEnzymatic activities of wild-type and mutant DsbC proteinsProtein3-aDsbCN, DsbCD, and DsbCC were prepared as described in the legend to Fig.4 A for N, D, and C of lanes 1, 2 and 3 respectively; m-DsbCN, m-DsbCD, and m-DsbCC as described in the legend to Fig. 4 B for S-carboxymethylated DsbCN, DsbCD, and DsbCC with net charge of 0, 1, and 2 under non-denaturing condition, respectively.Insulin reduction3-bReduced activity of 2 μm protein determined in 0.1 m potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0), containing 2 mm EDTA, 0.35 mm DTT, and 135 μm insulin.Oxidative refolding3-cOxidative activity determined in 0.1 m Tris buffer (pH 7.5), with 2 mm EDTA, 1.8 mm GSSG, and 0.3 mm DTT, 0.05 mg/ml reduced and denatured RNase A.

The data were expressed as averages of two independent experiments. Open table in a new tab As shown in Fig. 5, under nondenaturing condition, the Cys141-Cys163 disulfide bond of C98S/C101S was only reduced by a large excess of the strong reductant DTT but not by reduced glutathione (GSH), indicating that this disulfide, although partially solvent-exposed (14McMarthy A.A. Haebel P.W. Torronen A. Rybin V. Baker E. Metcalf P. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 196-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar), is stable in a reductive environment. As shown in Table III, compared with wild-type DsbC, C98S and C98S/C101S are devoid of enzyme activities and C101S/C163S shows approximate 30% reductase activity and 60% activity for catalyzing the oxidative refolding of RNase A. C141S and C163S show full enzyme activities of DsbC. As shown in Fig.6, C98S and C98S/C101S, although inactive as enzymes, show the same ability as that of wild-type DsbC to assist the in vitro reactivation of denatured GAPDH to 30% at molar ratios larger than 15. C141S and C163S at high concentrations stimulate the reactivation of GAPDH to a lower extent of 15%, and C101S/C163S to only 10%. C98S, C98S/C101S, C141S, C163S, and C101S/C163S all show similar CD spectra, the same intrinsic fluorescence maximal emission wavelength of 312 nm and the same retention time on a Superose 12 HR 10/30 column as that of wild-type DsbC (data not shown), indicating that the mutations do not affect the secondary structure in general and the dimerization of the subunits. As shown in Fig. 7, the Cmvalues, GdnHCl concentrations at the midpoints of unfolding curves measured by the ellipticity at 222 nm, of DsbC, C98S, and C98S/C101S are 2.19, 2.16, and 1.95 m, respectively, which are apparently higher than 1.46, 1.47, and 1.08 m for C141S, C163S, and C101S/C163S, respectively, suggesting that C98S and C98S/C101S appear to be as stable to GdnHCl denaturation as DsbC, while the proteins with the nonactive site Cys residues mutated are less stable. The above suggest that the nonactive site disulfide Cys141-Cys163 indeed plays an important structural role in the stability of the DsbC molecule. Moreover, the Cm values appear to be parallel to the solubility of the mutants in the periplasm; the higher the Cm, the more stable and soluble the proteins. As shown in Fig. 8 A, the refolding rates of denatured C98S and C98S/C101S upon dilution as monitored by the fluorescence emission intensity at 312 nm are the same as that of wild-type DsbC, and much faster than that of C101S/C163S, C141S, and C163S, suggesting that the formation of the nonactive site disulfide bond may accelerate the folding of DsbC molecule. Denatured and reduced DsbC, C98S, and C98S/C101S refolded markedly slower than the corresponding nonreduced species (Fig. 8 B), providing further support to the above suggestion. The DsbC subunit consists of a C-terminal thioredoxin-like domain with a CGYC- motif as the active site and a unique nonactive site disulfide in a helical subdomain and N-terminal association domain for dimerization (14McMarthy A.A. Haebel P.W. Torronen A. Rybin V. Baker E. Metcalf P. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 196-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). The present results have indicated that, as in eukaryotic PDI (30Quan H. Fan G.B. Wang C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17078-17080Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar), the -C XYC- motif of DsbC is necessary for enzyme activities but not required for chaperone activity; thus, the chaperone activity of DsbC is independent of the active site. Mutants C98S and C98S/C101S with Cys98 mutated lose enzyme activities completely but retain full chaperone activity, while C101S/C163S with Cys101 mutated retains partial enzyme activities, indicating that Cys98 is essential whereas Cys101 is relatively less important for DsbC to function as a thiol oxidoreductase. It was reported that a single mutation of Cys101 to Ser resulted in decrease of in vivobiological activities (16Joly J.C. Swartz J.R. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 10067-10072Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar); however, a C101V mutant showed no activity in catalyzing the reduction of insulin (5Missiakas D. Georgopoulos C. Raina S. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2013-2020Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Cys101 has been suggested to facilitate rapid disruption of mixed disulfides with substrate, allowing efficient scanning of several disulfide isomers and preventing trapping of DsbC in disulfide-linked complexes as in the case of PDI (31Ferrari D.M. Soling H.-D. Biochem. J. 1999; 339: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar). The nonactive site cysteines form a stable disulfide bond, Cys141-Cys163, which is resistant to the physiological reductant GSH at higher than in vivoconcentrations, and the formation of the disulfide bond is not affected by the presence of strong reductant DTT in culture. This disulfide is not required for enzymatic activity as C141S and C163S are fully active as a thiol oxidoreductase; however, the lack of this disulfide bond results in markedly decreased chaperone activity. Compared with both the wild-type DsbC and the mutants with intact Cys141-Cys163 disulfide, the mutants C141S, C163S, and C101S/C163S, with no Cys141-Cys163disulfide, show higher sensitivity to GdnHCl-denaturation with lower Cm values and lower refolding rates. The present data have provided evidence that the disulfide, Cys141-Cys163, does play a substantial role in sustaining the stability of the molecule and accelerating the refolding of denatured DsbC and contributes to the formation of a large uncharged surface of the V-shaped cleft (14McMarthy A.A. Haebel P.W. Torronen A. Rybin V. Baker E. Metcalf P. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 196-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar) for substrate binding. Lack of the Cys141-Cys163 disulfide, although it affects neither the export nor the processing, does decrease the solubility of the expressed mutants greatly so as to aggregate in the periplasm. It is known that many overexpressed recombinant proteins are liable to form inclusion bodies in the cytoplasm, but mostly soluble if targeted in the periplasm (32Stader J.A. Silhavy T.J. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 185: 167-187Google Scholar, 33Thomas J.G. Ayling A. Baneyx F. Appl. Biochem. Biotech. 1997; 66: 197-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). There are a few reports on periplasmic inclusion bodies (33Thomas J.G. Ayling A. Baneyx F. Appl. Biochem. Biotech. 1997; 66: 197-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar, 34Betton J.-M. Hofnung M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8046-8052Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Using the export pathway directed by a His-tagged signal and optimal induction by IPTG at 0.01 mmrecently established in this laboratory (21Liu X.Q. Zhang S. Pan X.M. Wang C.C. Protein Sci. 1999; 8: 2085-2089Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar), wild-type DsbC has been overproduced as a properly processed and soluble periplasmic protein; however, the mutants with Cys replaced by Ser, although processed correctly, behave differently in terms of solubility and/or cellular distribution. Lowering temperature to 25 °C increased the export and processing efficiency but did not improve the solubility of overexpressed proteins in the periplasm (data not shown). The His-tagged signal sequence does not affect the correct processing of the modified signal, since all the mutants have the authentic N terminus. The aggregation of C98S, C141S, C163S, and C101S/C163S in the periplasm does not appear to be resulted from the proteolysis resistance, a driving force for the formation of inclusion bodies in many cases, since all the insoluble mutants are digested by proteinase K. The possibility that the His tag at the N terminus of the signals affected the folding of mutated molecules was also excluded since wild-type DsbC is expressed as an easily soluble protein in the periplasm using the same expression system and the mutation sites are distant from the signal in both sequence and three-dimensional structure (14McMarthy A.A. Haebel P.W. Torronen A. Rybin V. Baker E. Metcalf P. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 196-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). Thus, it is suggested that the low stability of mutants of C141S, C163S and C101S/C163S with low Cm values may contribute to the insolubility in the periplasm. It is also possible that the solubility of a periplasmic protein may relate to its conformation before it reaches the periplasm or during translocation. From the facts that DsbC, C98S/C101S, and C98S containing the intact Cys141-Cys163 disulfide are soluble or partially soluble at least in the periplasm, and that C141S, C163S, and C101S/C163S with no Cys141-Cys163 disulfide aggregate in the periplasm and refold i n vitro apparently slower than the formers do, it is rational to speculate that the formation of the nonactive site disulfide bond Cys141-Cys163 is a key factor to stimulate further folding to a proper conformation. Failure of the formation of this disulfide may allow the folding intermediates to have their non-native hydrophobic surface exposed for a longer time and therefore more chance for incorrect interactions to form aggregates. We sincerely thank Dr. Rudi Glockshuber for the generous gift of plasmid pDsbC and Jian Li for his kind help in preparation of this manuscript."
https://openalex.org/W2032013602,"A fully active recombinant human ceruloplasmin was obtained, and it was mutated to produce a ceruloplasmin stable to proteolysis. The stable ceruloplasmin was further mutated to perturb the environment of copper at the type 1 copper sites in two different domains. The wild type and the mutated ceruloplasmin were produced in the yeast Pichia pastoris and characterized. The mutations R481A, R701A, and K887A were at the proteolytic sites, did not alter the enzymatic activity, and were all necessary to protect ceruloplasmin from degradation. The mutation L329M was at the tricoordinate type 1 site of the domain 2 and was ineffective to induce modifications of the spectroscopic and catalytic properties of ceruloplasmin, supporting the hypothesis that this site is reduced and locked in a rigid frame. In contrast the mutation C1021S at the type 1 site of domain 6 substantially altered the molecular properties of the protein, leaving a small fraction endowed with oxidase activity. This result, while indicating the importance of this site in stabilizing the overall protein structure, suggests that another type 1 site is competent for dioxygen reduction. During the expression of ceruloplasmin, the yeast maintained a high level of Fet3 that was released from membranes of yeast not harboring the ceruloplasmin gene. This indicates that expression of ceruloplasmin induces a state of iron deficiency in yeast because the ferric iron produced in the medium by its ferroxidase activity is not available for the uptake.

Res. 1993; 380: 163-179PubMed Google Scholar), biogenic amines (10Zaitsev V. Zaitseva I. Papiz M. Lindley P.F. J. Biol. Inorg.

Chem. 1999; 274: 20265-20270Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar).Ceruloplasmin supports such diverse functionalities by different catalytic activities. It has long been known that Cp is an oxidase and belongs to the class of multicopper “blue” oxidases (12Malmstrom B.G. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1982; 51: 21-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). These enzymes couple the four-electron reduction of dioxygen to water to the four sequential one-electron oxidations of a variety of substrates. Other enzymes of the same group are ascorbate oxidase, laccase, and Fet3, a plasma membrane protein of yeasts, recently discovered (13Askwith C. Eide D. Van Ho A. Bernard P.S. Li L. Davis-Kaplan S. Sipe D.M. Kaplan J. Cell. 1994; 76: 403-410Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (582) Google Scholar). Among these enzymes, only Cp (14Osaki S. J. Biol.

While the precise physiologic function of Cp associated to its amine oxidase activity has not yet been defined, the ferroxidase activity is now considered the main function of ceruloplasmin. The complete absence of Cp, because of inherited mutations (17Harris Z.L. Takahashi Y. Miyajima H. Serizawa M. MacGillivray R.T.A. Gitlin J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 2539-2543Crossref PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar) or targeted disruption of the Cp gene (18Harris Z.L. Durley A.P. Man T.K. Gitlin J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 10812-10817Crossref PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar), leads to a long term accumulation of parenchyma iron due to an impaired iron efflux from cells. The oxidation of the Fe(II) released from cells and its subsequent incorporation into apotransferrin would be the mechanism whereby Cp is involved in mediating iron release from cellular stores (19Osaki S. Johnson D.A. Frieden E. J. Biol. Chem. 1966; 241: 2746-2751Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Chidambaram M.V. Barnes G. Frieden E. FEBS Lett. 1983; 159: 137-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Analogously, the ferroxidase reaction performed by Fet3 is also an essential reaction for the high affinity iron uptake in yeasts (13Askwith C. Eide D. Van Ho A. Bernard P.S. Li L. Davis-Kaplan S. Sipe D.M. Kaplan J. Cell. 1994; 76: 403-410Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (582) Google Scholar, 21Yuan D.S. Stearman R. Dancis A. Dunn T. Beeler T. Klausner R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 2632-2636Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar).Multicopper oxidases contain three distinct spectroscopic types of copper sites: at least one type 1 (T1), or “blue,” site in addition to one type 2 (T2), or “normal,” copper site and to one type 3 (T3), or binuclear, copper site lacking an EPR signal (12Malmstrom B.G. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1982; 51: 21-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). The three copper atoms of these two last sites comprise a trinuclear cluster, observed in the x-ray structure of ascorbate oxidase (22Messerschmidt A. Ladenstein R. Huber R. Bolognesi M. Avigliano L. Petruzzelli R. Rossi A. Finazzi Agrò A. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 224: 179-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar), Cp (23Zaitseva I. Zaitsev V. Card G. Moshkov K. Bax B. Ralph A. Lindley P. J. Biol. Inorg. Chem. 1996; 1: 15-23Crossref Scopus (352) Google Scholar), and laccase (24Ducros V. Brzozowski A.M. Wilson K.S. Brown S.H. Ostergaard P. Schneider P. Yaver D.S. Pedersen A.H. Davies G.J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 310-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar), which serves as the oxygen binding and reducing site during the catalysis. The T1 is the site of entry of electrons from substrate. The T1 sites of multicopper oxidases exhibit different geometry and different redox potential, due to differences in their coordination sphere (25Holm R.H. Kennepohl P. Solomon E.I. Chem. Rev. 1996; 96: 2239-2314Crossref PubMed Scopus (2325) Google Scholar). With the exception of Cp, there is generally one T1 site per trinuclear cluster in these enzymes. A conserved structural motif of the polypeptide chain, His-Cys His, where the Cys is a ligand of the T1 site and the two His residues are ligands of two copper atoms of the cluster, facilitates the intramolecular electron transfer (ET) between the two sites, ∼13 Å apart (26Solomon E.I. Sundaram U.M. Machonkin T.E. Chem. Rev. 1996; 96: 2563-2605Crossref PubMed Scopus (3133) Google Scholar, 27Farver O. Bendahl L. Skov L.K. Pecht I. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36135-36140Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (26) Google Scholar).Ceruloplasmin contains multiple T1 sites. This is a long recognized peculiarity of Cp that has been outlined by numerous spectroscopic and catalytic studies and it has been confirmed by the x-ray structural studies on the human protein (23Zaitseva I. Zaitsev V. Card G. Moshkov K. Bax B. Ralph A. Lindley P. J. Biol. Inorg. Chem. 1996; 1: 15-23Crossref Scopus (352) Google Scholar). Human ceruloplasmin (HCp) is a single chain of 1046 amino acids (28Ortel T.L. Takahashi N. Putnam F.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 4761-4765Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), with a carbohydrate content of 7–8% and a copper content of six integral copper atoms. The x-ray structure has shown that the molecule of HCp is composed of six compact domains, with large loop insertions, and that the six integral copper atoms are distributed in one trinuclear cluster, located at the border between domains 1 and 6 and possessing ligands from each domain and in three mononuclear T1 sites. Those located in domains 4 and 6 are typical T1 sites such as that of ascorbate oxidase (22Messerschmidt A. Ladenstein R. Huber R. Bolognesi M. Avigliano L. Petruzzelli R. Rossi A. Finazzi Agrò A. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 224: 179-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar) and have a set of four ligands, two histidines, one cysteine, and one methionine, arranged in a distorted tetrahedral geometry. The one located in domain 2 is a tricoordinate T1 site in that it lacks the axial Met ligand, which is replaced in the amino acid sequence by Leu, as the single blue site of some laccases (26Solomon E.I. Sundaram U.M. Machonkin T.E. Chem. Rev. 1996; 96: 2563-2605Crossref PubMed Scopus (3133) Google Scholar), and Fet3 (29Hassett R. Kosman D.J. Yuan D.S. Kosman D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23274-23282Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). These latter sites have redox potential values higher than those of typical T1 sites. Whether and how all three T1 sites take part in the turnover reaction of Cp is presently a major question (27Farver O. Bendahl L. Skov L.K. Pecht I. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36135-36140Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Only the T1 site of domain 6 is connected by the cysteine-histidine linkages to the trinuclear cluster (23Zaitseva I. Zaitsev V. Card G. Moshkov K. Bax B. Ralph A. Lindley P. J. Biol. Inorg. Chem. 1996; 1: 15-23Crossref Scopus (352) Google Scholar). Binding sites for iron (15Lindley P. Card G. Zaitseva I. Zaitsev V. Reinhammar B. Selin-Lindgren E. Yoshida K. J. Biol. Inorg. Chem. 1997; 2: 454-463Crossref Scopus (114) Google Scholar) and amine substrates (10Zaitsev V. Zaitseva I. Papiz M. Lindley P.F. J. Biol. Inorg. Chem. 1999; 4: 579-587Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar) have been identified in domains 4 and 6 by x-ray studies, which did not evidence equivalent structures on domain 2. This latter finding has been related to the peculiar redox properties of the T1 site of domain 2. A redox potential value of at least 1 V has been calculated for this site, which is apparently the highest one among T1 sites of blue proteins (30Machonkin T.E. Zhang H.H. Hedman B. Hodgson K.O. Solomon E.I. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 9570-9578Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). On this basis, it has been postulated that the copper at this center stays permanently reduced, thus spectroscopically silent and not able to take part in the catalytic cycle of the oxidase.Mutation studies have been used to clarify the influence of ligands and the contribution of other elements of the protein matrix to the properties of each type of copper (31Shimizu A. Know J.H. Sasaki T. Satoh T. Sakurai N. Sakurai T. Yamaguchi S. Samejima T. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 3034-3042Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 32Xu F. Palmer A.E. Yaver D.S. Berka R.M.

Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 2316-2324Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Although a recombinant human ceruloplasmin has been expressed in mammalian cells and it has been partially purified (34Rafiq M. Suen C.K.M. Choudhury L. Joannou C.L. White K.N. Evans R.W. FEBS Lett. 1997; 407: 132-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), the physicochemical properties of the recombinant protein were not assessed. In this paper, we report the expression of human ceruloplasmin in Pichia pastoris and the use of site-directed mutagenesis to explore its structure to function relationships. The residues responsible for the proteolytic susceptibility of the protein, Arg481, Arg701, and Lys887 had to be mutated in tandem ahead of targeted mutations at the copper sites. Mutation of Leu329 to Met and of Cys1021 to Ser in the coordination sphere of the T1 sites of domains 2 and 6, respectively, demonstrated a different role for these two sites. During the expression of the heterologous oxidase, the yeast maintained its endogenous oxidase Fet3, although a soluble, fully active, derivative of Fet3 was found in the medium.DISCUSSIONWe succeeded in obtaining a recombinant human ceruloplasmin displaying all of the properties of the authentic protein as purified from plasma. Unfortunately, the recombinant protein retained also the susceptibility of HCp to proteolysis, a property that has hampered all studies on this protein (45Rydèn L. Lontie R. Copper Proteins and Copper Enzymes. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1984: 37-100Google Scholar). The stability of the triple mutant that we obtained by substituting Arg481, Arg701, and Lys887 with alanine demonstrates that only these residues are responsible for the fragmentation pattern that affects all ceruloplasmin preparations.It should be recalled that the lability of human ceruloplasmin is such that it is found fragmented even in the plasma (38Musci G. Bonaccorsi di Patti M.C. Fagiolo U. Calabrese L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13388-13392Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The fragments initially do not dissociate and mimic the intact molecule, but the protein suffers changes of its redox properties that lead to a redistribution of electrons within its copper sites (46Calabrese L. Musci G. Messerschmidt A. Molecular Properties of Ceruloplasmin from Different Species in Multi-Copper Oxidase. World Scientific Publications, Singapore1997: 307-354Google Scholar). In fact, the antioxidant or the prooxidant activities of Cp are specific to the cleaved and to the intact molecule, respectively (8Mukhopadhyay C.K. Mazumder B. Lindley P.F. Fox P.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11546-11551Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Thus, it was of outmost importance to have a stable Cp to work with before attempting mutagenesis targeted to the copper sites.The mutagenesis has been focused on the two T1 copper sites more critical to the function of ceruloplasmin (i.e. those on domains 2 and 6). The aim of these experiments was not only studying the role of the ligands on the properties of the sites, as it is the case of current studies on multicopper oxidases containing a single T1 site. In the case of ceruloplasmin, the major problem concerns the reasons for having multiple T1 sites with different disposition with respect to a single trinuclear cluster (23Zaitseva I. Zaitsev V. Card G. Moshkov K. Bax B. Ralph A. Lindley P. J. Biol. Inorg. Chem. 1996; 1: 15-23Crossref Scopus (352) Google Scholar). This is a peculiarity of ceruloplasmin that cannot be simply related to the necessity of increased potentiality of electron capture from substrates. Fet3 has only one T1 site (29Hassett R. Kosman D.J. Yuan D.S. Kosman D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23274-23282Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) and is as able as Cp to oxidize both Fe(II) ions and amines. Structural and catalytic studies are trying to find plausible electron transfer pathways in the molecule to disclose the functional relations of the three sites, if any (27Farver O. Bendahl L. Skov L.K. Pecht I. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36135-36140Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (26) Google Scholar), and their interaction with the cluster during catalysis (15Lindley P. Card G. Zaitseva I. Zaitsev V. Reinhammar B. Selin-Lindgren E. Yoshida K. J. Biol. Inorg. Chem. 1997; 2: 454-463Crossref Scopus (114) Google Scholar).The mutation of Cys1021 to Ser was performed for this purpose. Since it has been ascertained that mutation of Cys at the T1 site is fatal to multicopper oxidases having a single T1 site, this mutation in the T1 site of domain 6 of Cp should clarify whether this site is the entrance to the bifurcate ET pathway to the cluster also for electrons (possibly) released to the other T1 sites. The same mutation in Fet3 succeeded in producing an inactive T1-depleted protein that conserved unaltered the structure of the T2 and T3 sites (33Blackburn N.J. Ralle M. Hassett R. Kosman D.J. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 2316-2324Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). An analogous mutation in bilirubin oxidase produced an inactive protein that did not, however, conserve the trinuclear cluster intact (31Shimizu A. Know J.H. Sasaki T. Satoh T. Sakurai N. Sakurai T. Yamaguchi S. Samejima T. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 3034-3042Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Our results on the C1021S mutant, its anomalous behavior during purification, and its much less than stoichiometric copper content indicate that the occupancy of the T1 site of domain 6 contributes to stabilizing the other copper binding sites and/or the protein structure. The observation of a species of this mutant retaining the enzymatic activity indicates that another T1 site is able to engage a redox reaction with the cluster. This site is most likely that of domain 4, since x-ray experiments locate on it the binding site for amine substrates (10Zaitsev V. Zaitseva I. Papiz M. Lindley P.F. J. Biol. Inorg. Chem. 1999; 4: 579-587Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar).Since the substitution of Cys abolishes the character of the T1 site, the mutation of Cys1021 is also important to shed some light on the spectroscopic properties of HCp. Our results indicate that future studies aimed at producing rHCp mutated at domain 6 that is suitable for spectroscopic studies have to be carefully planned. In fact, the mutation C1021D failed to produce transformants with meaningful expression. 2P. Bielli, G. C. Bellenchi, and L. Calabrese, unpublished results.HCp typically occurs in a partially reduced state (30Machonkin T.E. Zhang H.H. Hedman B. Hodgson K.O. Solomon E.I. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 9570-9578Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 44Musci G. Bonaccorsi di Patti M.C. Calabrese L. J. Protein Chem. 1995; 14: 611-619Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The protein treated with oxidants still contains reduced copper, and its molar absorptivity does not exceed the value of 9000m−1 cm−1, which is consistent with only two T1 sites bearing Cu(II) ions (26Solomon E.I. Sundaram U.M. Machonkin T.E. Chem. Rev. 1996; 96: 2563-2605Crossref PubMed Scopus (3133) Google Scholar). The EPR spectra of the resting, as isolated, and of the oxidized forms of HCp can, however, be simulated on the basis of two (30Machonkin T.E. Zhang H.H. Hedman B. Hodgson K.O. Solomon E.I. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 9570-9578Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) as well as of three (43Musci G. Bonaccorsi di Patti M.C. Calabrese L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 306: 111-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 56) nonequivalent T1 components. This problem is related to the state and the function of the T1 site of domain 2 which has been the target of the other mutation, L329M.Methionine is not an indispensable residue to produce the peculiar nature of the T1 site, which seems rather to be related to the ligation of Cys within the trigonal core ligation His-Cys-His (25Holm R.H. Kennepohl P. Solomon E.I. Chem. Rev. 1996; 96: 2239-2314Crossref PubMed Scopus (2325) Google Scholar). Its more likely role is to tune the redox potential and the spectroscopic properties of the site, as indicated by extensive site-directed mutagenesis of blue proteins (47Canters G.W. Gilardi G. FEBS Lett. 1993; 325: 39-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 48Romero A. Hoitink C.W. Nar H. Huber R. Messerschmidt A. Canters G.W. J. Mol.

Biochemistry. 1999; 39: 12675-12680Crossref Scopus (74) Google Scholar) and also by results on multicopper oxidases (31Shimizu A. Know J.H. Sasaki T. Satoh T. Sakurai N. Sakurai T. Yamaguchi S. Samejima T. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 3034-3042Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). That the mutation of leucine 329 to methionine in the polypeptide chain of human ceruloplasmin is silent under all aspects is an intriguing result that can, however, shed some light on the properties of tricoordinate T1 sites of multicopper oxidase.Assuming that Met329 is able to bind the copper atom of the site of domain 2, a conclusion would be that Met329 binds copper without any effect on the structure of the site. The recent study on Trametes villosa laccase shows that all properties of the enzyme are affected by the mutation of Phe463 to Met (32Xu F. Palmer A.E. Yaver D.S. Berka R.M. Gambetta G.A. Brown S.H. Solomon E.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12372-12375Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). The changes of the spectroscopic properties observed in this enzyme, a 13-nm shift in the maximal absorption wavelength and the variation of magnetic parameters of the EPR spectrum, are such that they had to be detected even when masked by the contribution of other T1 sites, as in rHCp. A decrease of 0.1 V of the redox potential value accompanies the variation of the spectroscopic properties in mutated laccase, resulting in an EPR signal intermediate between that of the wild type laccase and of the typical T1 site of plastocyanin. As to the variation of the redox potential expected for mutated T1 site of HCp, it has to be considered that the value calculated for this site in authentic HCp exceeds 1 V (30Machonkin T.E. Zhang H.H. Hedman B. Hodgson K.O. Solomon E.I. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 9570-9578Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) so that even when lowered by hundreds of mV, according to the results on laccase and those obtained in model systems (51Olsonn M.H.M. Ryde U. J. Biol. Inorg. Chem. 1999; 4: 654-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), it would remain an exceedingly high value, the highest among T1 sites. Assuming that it is in the reduced state in the wild type protein, it will probably remain in this state also in the L329M mutant, explaining why the mutation fails to affect spectroscopic and catalytic properties of HCp. The fact that the introduction of Met is unable to render this site more similar to the other two T1 sites confirms that other elements of the protein matrix play an important role beyond ligands in tuning the structure of T1 sites (32Xu F.

It might either play an active role in the reactions of the oxidase, under the specific control of effectors affecting its redox properties, or be responsible to other functions, specific to the human protein. This consideration comes from the observation that the three T1 sites of other mammalian ceruloplasmin (54Musci G. Fraterrigo T.Z.L. Calabrese L. McMillin D.R. J. Biol. Inorg. Chem. 1999; 4: 441-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) do not differ between each other to the extent that characterizes human ceruloplasmin.An additional finding of this work was that secreted ceruloplasmin can affect the iron metabolism of the yeast. The fact that the transformed yeast cells tend to maintain a constant level of Fet3 on their membranes balancing the leakage of the protein indicates that they are in a condition of iron deficiency (13Askwith C.

Beeler T. Klausner R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 2632-2636Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). The only way to explain this result is to consider that recombinant ceruloplasmin is under turnover conditions as a ferroxidase in the medium of induced cells, as demonstrated by its partially reduced state upon isolation. This would shift the redox state of iron to an oxidized ferric form not available to cells, confirming that uptake of iron by yeast requires Fe(III) ions produced by a member (Fet3) of its transport system (55Askwith C. Kaplan J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 135-138Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). The ferroxidase reaction of ceruloplasmin, which decreases the level of free Fe(II) in the plasma, favoring release of iron from cells, results in a condition of iron deficiency for yeast with consequent induction of Fet3. Ceruloplasmin (Cp)1 is a 130-kDa multicopper protein widely distributed in vertebrates. It occurs mainly in the plasma and plays an important role in iron homeostasis (1Frieden E. Hsieh H.S. Adv.

Res. 1993; 380: 163-179PubMed Google Scholar), biogenic amines (10Zaitsev V. Zaitseva I. Papiz M. Lindley P.F. J. Biol. Inorg.

Chem. 1999; 274: 20265-20270Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Ceruloplasmin supports such diverse functionalities by different catalytic activities. It has long been known that Cp is an oxidase and belongs to the class of multicopper “blue” oxidases (12Malmstrom B.G. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1982; 51: 21-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar).
