https://openalex.org/W2095408546,"We have produced mice that lack major histocompatibility complex class II antigens, permitting us to evaluate the role of these molecules in diverse aspects of T and B cell differentiation. The mutant mice show near-complete elimination of CD4+ T lymphocytes from the spleen and lymph nodes; the few remaining CD4-positive cells are preferentially localized to B cell follicles. Surprisingly, substantial numbers of CD4 single-positive cells reside in the thymus; however, these are not mature thymocytes as we currently recognize them. B lymphocytes occur in normal numbers and are capable of terminal differentiation to plasma cells. Nevertheless, several aberrations in the B cell compartment are demonstrable: a lack of germinal centers, fewer IgM+IgD+ cells in certain individuals, reduced production of serum IgG1, and complete inability to respond to T-dependent antigens. In short, the class II-negative mice have confirmed some old ideas about lymphocyte differentiation, but have provided some surprises."
https://openalex.org/W2079557259,"A key step in the regulation of transcription involves interactions between promoter-selective factors and various components of the transcriptional apparatus. Here we report the requirements for transcriptional activation directed by NTF-1, a developmentally regulated transcription factor in Drosophila. Reconstituted transcription with fractionated Drosophila basal factors reveals that activation by NTF-1 requires factors present in the endogenous TFIID fraction that are distinct from the purified TATA-binding protein (TBP). Glycerol gradient sedimentation and immunoprecipitation analyses indicate that TFIID is a multiprotein complex containing TBP and at least six tightly bound TBP-associated factors (TAFs). Preparations of TBP lacking TAFs after fractionation with denaturants no longer support activation by NTF-1 but retain basal level activity. Addition of immunopurified and renatured TAFs to free TBP restores the ability of NTF-1 to activate transcription without influencing basal transcription. These results suggest that one or more of the TAF polypeptides confer coactivator function."
https://openalex.org/W2026571586,"Calcium-induced calcium release (CICR) may function widely in calcium-mediated cell signaling, but has been most thoroughly characterized in muscle cells. In a homogenate of sea urchin eggs, which display transients in the intracellular free calcium concentration ([Ca2+]i) during fertilization and anaphase, addition of Ca2+ triggered CICR. Ca2+ release was also induced by the CICR modulators ryanodine and caffeine. Responses to both Ca2+ and CICR modulators (but not Ca2+ release mediated by inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate) were inhibited by procaine and ruthenium red, inhibitors of CICR. Intact eggs also displayed transients of [Ca2+]i when microinjected with ryanodine. Cyclic ADP-ribose, a metabolite with potent Ca(2+)-releasing properties, appears to act by way of the CICR mechanism and may thus be an endogenous modulator of CICR. A CICR mechanism is present in these nonmuscle cells as is assumed in various models of intracellular Ca2+ wave propagation."
https://openalex.org/W2144614846,"Segmental pattern in the Drosophila embryo is established by two maternal factors localized to the anterior and posterior poles of the egg cell. Here we provide molecular evidence that the localized posterior factor is the RNA of the nanos (nos) gene. nos RNA is localized to the posterior pole of early embryos, and nos protein acts at a distance to direct abdomen formation. Synthetic nos RNA has biological activity identical to that of the posterior pole plasm. Injection of nos RNA rescues the segmentation defect of embryos derived from females mutant for all nine known posterior group genes. Injection of nos RNA into the anterior is able to direct formation of ectopic posterior structures. Our results demonstrate that a localized source of nos RNA is sufficient to specify abdominal segmentation and imply that other posterior group genes are required for localization, stabilization, or distribution of the nos gene product."

https://openalex.org/W1543158853,"Synthetic peptides have been used to define the consensus amino acid sequence for substrate recognition by the meiosis-activated myelin basic protein (MBP) kinase (p44mpk), which was purified from maturing sea star oocytes. This protein kinase shares many properties with the mitogen-activated microtubule-associated protein-2 kinase (p42mapk) in vertebrates. Recently, Thr-97 in the tryptic fragment KNIVTPRTPPPSQGK of bovine MBP was identified as the major site of phosphorylation by p44mpk (Sanghera, J. S., Aebersold, R., Morrison, H. D., Bures, E. J., and Pelech, S. L. (1990) FEBS Lett. 273, 223-226). Synthetic peptides modeled after this sequence revealed that the presence of a proline residue C-terminal (+1 position) to the phosphorylatable threonine (or serine) residue was critical for recognition by p44mpk. Although not essential, a proline residue located at the -2 position enhanced the Vmax of peptide phosphorylation. Basic, acidic, and non-polar residues were equally tolerated at the -1 position. The presence of an amino acid residue at position -3 also increased peptide phosphorylation. Thus, the optimum consensus sequence for phosphorylation by p44mpk was defined as Pro-X-(Ser/Thr)-Pro, where X is a variable amino acid residue, but ideally not a Pro. Peptides that included this sequence were phosphorylated by p44mpk with Vmax values approaching 1 mumol.min-1.mg-1 and with apparent Km values of approximately 1 mM). Pseudosubstrate peptides in which the phosphorylatable residue was replaced by valine or alanine were weak inhibitors of p44mpk (apparent Ki values of approximately 3 mM). Over 40 distinct protein kinases contain Pro-X-(Ser/Thr)-Pro sequences including the human receptors for insulin and epidermal growth factor, and kinases encoded by the human proto-oncogenes abl, neu, and raf-1, and Schizosaccharomyces pombe cell cycle control genes ran-1 and wee-1. Multiple putative sites were also identified in rat microtubule-associated protein-2, human retinoblastoma protein, human tau protein, and Drosophila myb protein and RNA polymerase II."
https://openalex.org/W1996827828,"Replication of human immunodeficiency virus requires binding of the viral Tat protein to its RNA target sequence TAR; peptides derived from Tat bind to a TAR ""contact site"" spanning 5 bp and a trinucleotide pyrimidine bulge. We find that high affinity binding requires a U residue in the bulge loop and 2 specific adjacent base pairs. Other bulged RNAs bind in a lower affinity nonspecific manner; sequence-specific binding requires a bulge loop of more than 1 nucleotide. Reaction with diethyl pyrocarbonate indicates that one effect of the bulge is to make the otherwise deep and narrow RNA major groove accessible. A model consistent with these data involves local distortion of A-form geometry at the bulge, which bends the helix and permits protein binding and interactive access in the RNA major groove."
https://openalex.org/W2043625609,"In MDCK cells, Golgi to basolateral transport of several membrane proteins has been found to involve a cytoplasmic domain determinant. In some cases (Fc receptor, lysosomal glycoprotein Igp120), the determinant appears similar to that required for endocytosis via clathrin-coated pits; for Igp120, elimination of a single cytoplasmic domain tyrosine both blocks internalization and results in apical transport. In other cases (LDL receptor), the determinant does not involve the cytoplasmic domain tyrosine required for endocytosis. Thus, contrary to current models, basolateral transport in MCDK cells occurs not by default but depends on one or more cytoplasmic domain determinants, the precise nature of which is unknown. For some proteins, it is closely related to coated pit determinants. The fact that many membrane proteins can reach the apical surface in the absence of this determinant suggests that signals for apical transport are widely distributed."
https://openalex.org/W1976700610,"UNDERSTANDING the actions of the neurotransmitter dopamine in the brain is important in view of its roles in neuropsychiatric illnesses1. Dopamine D1 receptors, which stimulate both adenylyl cyclase2 and phospholipase C3, and D2 receptors, which inhibit them4,5, can nevertheless act synergistically to produce many electrophysiological and behavioural responses6. Because this functional synergism can occur at the level of single neurons, another, as yet unidentified, signalling pathway activated by dopamine has been hypothesized7. We report here that in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells transfected with the D2 receptor complementary DNA, D2 agonists potently enhance arachidonic acid release, provided that such release has been initiated by stimulating constitutive purinergic receptors or by increasing intracellular Ca2+. In CHO cells expressing D1 receptors, D1 agonists exert no such effect. When D1 and D2 receptors are coexpressed, however, activation of both subtypes results in a marked synergistic potentiation of arachidonic acid release. The numerous actions of arachidonic acid and its metabolites in neuronal signal transduction8 suggest that facilitation of its release may be implicated in dopaminergic responses, such as feedback inhibition mediated by D2 autoreceptors, and may constitute a molecular basis for D1/D2 receptor synergism."
https://openalex.org/W1586275583,"Effects of aluminum, magnesium, and fluoride (AMF) on members of both the trimeric G protein and smaller (20-25 kDa) monomeric GTP-binding protein families were examined. The dissociation of GDP from G proteins was blocked by AMF but was unchanged with the addition of AMF to any of six of the monomeric GTP-binding proteins. Biochemical activities and properties of one of the smaller GTP-binding proteins, ADP-ribosylation factor, were also found to be unaffected by AMF. It is concluded that the ability of AMF to activate the trimeric G proteins is not shared by the smaller GTP-binding proteins and thus should prove to be a useful discriminator between cellular activities regulated by these two families of regulatory proteins."
https://openalex.org/W2069472625,"The A5 antigen is a neuronal cell surface protein of Xenopus presumed to be involved in the neuronal recognition between the optic nerve fibers and the visual centers. Analyses of cDNA clones revealed that the A5 antigen is a class I membrane protein containing two different internal repeats in the extracellular segment. The first repeat bears homology to domain III of complement components C1r and C1s, and the second repeat is homologous to the C1 and C2 domains of coagulation factors V and VIII. The mRNA for the A5 antigen was present in retinal ganglion cells and visual center neurons. Nonneuronal cells in the peripheral and central nervous systems did not express the mRNA for the A5 antigen."

https://openalex.org/W1589088345,"Pseudomonas exotoxin (PE) is a 66,000 molecular weight protein secreted by Pseudomonas aeruginosa. PE is made up of three domains, and PE40 is a form of PE which lacks domain Ia (amino acids 1-252) and has very low cytotoxicity because it cannot bind to target cells. The sequence Arg-Glu-Asp-Leu-Lys (REDLK) at the carboxyl terminus of Pseudomonas exotoxin has been shown to be important for its cytotoxic activity (Chaudhary, V. K., Jinno, Y., FitzGerald, D. J., and Pastan, I. (1990) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 87, 308-312). In this study, we tested the effect of altering the carboxyl sequence of PE from REDLK to the characteristic endoplasmic reticulum retention sequence, KDEL, or to KDEL repeated three times (KDEL)3. We also made similar changes at the carboxyl terminus of two chimeric toxins in which domain I of PE (amino acids 1-252) was either replaced with transforming growth factor alpha (TGF alpha) to make TGF alpha-PE40 or with a single chain antibody (anti-Tac) reacting with the human interleukin 2 receptor to make anti-Tac(Fv)-PE40. Statistical analyses of our results demonstrate that PE and its derivatives ending in KDEL or (KDEL)3 are significantly more active than PE or derivatives ending in REDLK. We have also found that brefeldin A, which is known to perturb the endoplasmic reticulum, inhibits the cytotoxic action of PE. Our results suggest that the altered carboxyl terminus may enable the toxin to interact more efficiently with a cellular component involved in translocation of the toxin to the cytosol."
https://openalex.org/W1588478093,"Alzheimer's disease, a progressive neurodegenerative disorder, affects greater than 10% of the population of individuals greater than 65 years of age. A principal neuropathological feature of this disease is the senile plaque, a fibrillar extracellular deposit primarily composed of a approximately 4-kDa peptide, beta/A4, derived from the amyloid precursor protein (APP). Studies in cultured cells have documented that APP matures through a constitutive secretory pathway and is cleaved at or near the cell surface to release a large ectodomain into the extracellular space. To define the APP cleavage site, we constructed a Chinese hamster ovary cell line, which constitutively overexpresses human APP-770, and analyzed the COOH termini of secreted APP-770-related molecules. Using plasma desorption mass spectrometry and chemical microsequencing, we document that an APP cleavage site in Chinese hamster ovary cells leading to secretion occurs immediately COOH-terminal to lysine residue 687, which lies adjacent to the hydrophobic membrane-spanning domain."
https://openalex.org/W1529654145,"In previous work, we identified a Saccharomyces cerevisiae glycogen synthase gene, GSY1, which codes for an 85-kDa polypeptide present in purified yeast glycogen synthase (Farkas, I., Hardy, T.A., DePaoli-Roach, A.A., and Roach, P.J. (1990) J. Biol. Chem. 265, 20879-20886). We have now cloned another gene, GSY2, which encodes a second S. cerevisiae glycogen synthase. The GSY2 sequence predicts a protein of 704 residues, molecular weight 79,963, with 80% identity to the protein encoded by GSY1. Amino acid sequences obtained from a second polypeptide of 77 kDa present in yeast glycogen synthase preparations matched those predicted by GSY2. GSY1 resides on chromosome VI, and GSY2 is located on chromosome XII. Disruption of the GSY1 gene produced a strain retaining about 85% of wild type glycogen synthase activity at stationary phase, while disruption of the GSY2 gene yielded a strain with only about 10% of wild type enzyme activity. The level of glycogen synthase activity in yeast cells disrupted for GSY1 increased in stationary phase, whereas the activity remained at a constant low level in cells disrupted for GSY2. Disruption of both genes resulted in a viable haploid that totally lacked glycogen synthase activity and was defective in glycogen deposition. In conclusion, yeast expresses two forms of glycogen synthase with activity levels that behave differently in the growth cycle. The GSY2 gene product appears to be the predominant glycogen synthase with activity linked to nutrient depletion."
https://openalex.org/W1527816465,"Agents that activate cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) as well as agents that increase intracellular calcium induce the expression of certain immediate early genes (IEGs). Recently, it has been demonstrated that the same cis-acting element in the 5' region of the c-fos gene has the ability to mediate both cAMP- and calcium-induced c-fos expression in PC12 cells (Sheng, M., McFadden, G., and Greenberg, M. (1990) Neuron 4, 571-582). Here we demonstrate that both cAMP- and calcium-mediated induction of c-fos and egr1 are dependent on PKA activity. Addition of either depolarizing concentrations of KCl or the calcium ionophore, ionomycin, to PC12 cells increased the expression of both c-fos and egr1, but these inductions were dramatically reduced in three PKA-deficient cell lines, 123.7, AB.11, and A126-1B2. Furthermore, pretreatment of PC12 cells with 20 microM H89, a specific inhibitor of PKA, inhibited forskolin, dibutyryl cAMP, and KCl-induced c-fos and egr1 induction, while having no effect on NGF induction. Likewise, in the PKA-deficient cells, NGF or an activator of protein kinase C induced c-fos and egr1 normally. To determine if PKA deficiency modifies the ability of Ca2+ to activate calcium-dependent kinases, autophosphorylation of multifunctional Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase (CaM kinase) in response to Ca2+ influx was determined. In parental PC12 cells, PC12 cells pretreated with H89, and PKA-deficient cell lines, CaM kinase was activated equivalently in response to KCl depolarization. These results suggest that PKA is not required for Ca(2+)-induced increase in CaM kinase activity and that the induction of IEGs in response to Ca2+ influx is PKA-dependent. Thus, the requirement for PKA resides at a point distal to the activation of calmodulin-dependent processes."
https://openalex.org/W2092493820,"Alloimmune mice (mice that have been exposed to cells from another murine strain) were shown to make antibodies against gp120 and p24 of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), and mice of the autoimmune strains MRL-lpr/lpr and MRL-+/+ made antibodies against gp120. This is surprising because the mice were not exposed to HIV. Furthermore, anti-anti-MHC antibodies (molecules that have shapes similar to those of major histocompatibility complex molecules) were detected in both alloimmune sera and MRL mice. These results are discussed in the context of a possible role for allogeneic stimuli in the pathogenesis of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, as suggested by an idiotypic network model."
https://openalex.org/W2140695410,"Abstract Eleven amino acid substitutions at Val-121 of human carbonic anhydrase II including Gly, Ala, Ser, Leu, Ile, Lys, and Arg, were constructed by site-directed mutagenesis. This residue is at the mouth of the hydrophobic pocket in the enzyme active site. The CO2 hydrase activity and the p-nitrophenyl esterase activity of these CAII variants correlate with the hydrophobicity of the residue, suggesting that the hydrophobic character of this residue is important for catalysis. The effects of these mutations on the steady-state kinetics for CO2 hydration occur mainly in kcat/Km and Km, consistent with involvement of this residue in CO2 association. The Val-121----Ala mutant, which exhibits about one-third normal CO2 hydrase activity, has been studied by x-ray crystallographic methods. No significant changes in the mutant enzyme conformation are evident relative to the wild-type enzyme. Since Val-121 is at the mouth of the hydrophobic pocket, its substitution by the methyl side chain of alanine makes the pocket mouth significantly wider than that of the wild-type enzyme. Hence, although a moderately wide (and deep) pocket is important for substrate association, a wider mouth to this pocket does not seriously compromise the catalytic approach of CO2 toward nucleophilic zinc-bound hydroxide."
https://openalex.org/W1564858254,"The role of protein residues in activating the substrate in the reaction catalyzed by the flavoprotein p-hydroxybenzoate hydroxylase was studied. X-ray crystallography (Schreuder, H. A., Prick, P.A.J., Wieringa, R.K., Vriend, G., Wilson, K.S., Hol, W.G. J., and Drenth, J. (1989) J. Mol. Biol. 208, 679-696) indicates that Tyr-201 and Tyr-385 form a hydrogen bond network with the 4-OH of p-hydroxybenzoate. Therefore, site directed mutants were constructed, converting each of these tyrosines into phenylalanines. Spectral (visible and fluorescence) properties, reduction potentials, and binding constants are very similar to those of wild type, indicating that there are no major structural changes in the mutants. In the absence of substrate, the mutants and wild type exhibit similar pH-dependent changes in the FAD spectrum. However, the enzyme-substrate complex of Tyr-201—-Phe lacks an ionization observed in both wild type and Tyr-385—-Phe, which preferentially bind the phenolate form of substrates. Tyr-201—-Phe shows no preference, indicating that Tyr-201 is required to ionize the substrate. The mutants have less than 6% the activity of the wild type enzyme. The effects on catalysis were studied by stopped flow techniques. Reduction of FAD by NADPH is slower by 10-fold in Tyr-201—-Phe and 100-fold in Tyr-385—-Phe. When the reduced Tyr-201—-Phe-p-hydroxybenzoate complex reacts with oxygen, a long-lived flavin-C(4a)-hydroperoxide is observed, which slowly eliminates H2O2 with very little hydroxylation. Thus, the role of Tyr-201 is to activate the substrate by stabilizing the phenolate. Tyr-385—-Phe reacts with oxygen to form 25% oxidized enzyme, and 75% flavin hydroperoxide, which successfully hydroxylates the substrate. This mutant also hydroxylates the product (3, 4-dihydroxybenzoate) to form gallic acid."
https://openalex.org/W2001460034,"The intrinsic neuronal code that carries visual information and the perceptual mechanism for decoding that information are not known. However, multivariate statistics and information theory show that neurons in four visual areas simultaneously carry multiple, stimulus-related messages by utilizing multiplexed temporal codes. The complexity of these temporal messages increases progressively across the visual system, yet the temporal codes overlap in time. Thus, visual perception may depend on the concurrent processing of multiplexed temporal messages from all visual areas."
https://openalex.org/W1561354622,"The heparin-binding p30 protein amphoterin is proposed to mediate adhesive interactions of the advancing plasma membrane in migrating and differentiating cells. Since the NH2-terminal part of amphoterin is exceptionally rich in lysine residues, we have studied its interactions with plasminogen and tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA). On immunostaining of N18 neuroblastoma cells, amphoterin and t-PA showed a close co-localization in the filopodia of the leading membrane and in the substrate-attached material. In purified systems, both t-PA and plasminogen bound to immobilized amphoterin, and their binding was inhibited by the lysine analogue epsilon-aminocaproic acid. Plasminogen bound to immobilized amphoterin was activated by t-PA, and this resulted in effective degradation of the immobilized amphoterin. Correspondingly, amphoterin-bound t-PA activated plasminogen. In solution amphoterin accelerated t-PA-catalyzed plasminogen activation maximally 46-fold. The results indicate that t-PA and plasminogen form through their lysine-binding sites a complex with amphoterin, which results in acceleration of plasminogen activation and effective degradation of amphoterin. We suggest that local acceleration of t-PA-catalyzed plasminogen activation by amphoterin at the leading membrane enhances the penetration of growing cytoplasmic processes through extracellular materials during cell migration, differentiation and regeneration. The amphoterin-mediated adhesion at the leading membrane may be transient in nature, because the protein also enhances its own breakdown by accelerating t-PA-catalyzed plasminogen activation."
https://openalex.org/W2026134505,"The targeting of synaptophysin, a major synaptic vesicle protein, in transfected nonneuronal cells has important implications for synaptic vesicle biogenesis, but has proved controversial. We have analyzed four transfected cell types by differential centrifugation and velocity gradient sedimentation to determine whether synaptophysin is targeted to endosomes or to synaptic vesicle-like structures. Synaptophysin was recovered only in vesicles that sedimented more rapidly than synaptic vesicles. The synaptophysin-containing vesicles were labeled if a surface-labeled cell was warmed to 37°C, comigrated with transferrin receptor-containing vesicles on velocity and density gradients, and could be completely immunoadsorbed by anti-LDL receptor tail antibodies. These data demonstrate that synaptophysin was targeted to the early endocytotic pathway in the transfected cells and are inconsistent with the suggestion that synaptophysin expression induces a novel population of vesicles. Targeting of synaptophysin to early endosomes implicates their role in synaptic vesicle biogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W1562095964,"Human platelets possess active lipoxygenase and cyclooxygenase which convert arachidonic acid to (12S)-12-hydroperoxy-5,8,10,14-eicosatetraenoic acid (12-HPETE) plus (12S)-12-hydroxy-5,8,10,14-eicosatetraenoic acid (12-HETE) and thromboxane B2 plus 12-hydroxy-5,8,10-heptadecatrienoic acid (HHT), respectively. When platelet homogenates were incubated with arachidonate, there was a rapid consumption of platelet tocopherol. Time course analysis revealed that within 0.5 min, over half of arachidonate and tocopherol were metabolized. Mass formation of 12-HPETE and 12-HETE or thromboxane B2 and HHT exceeded that of the mass of tocopherol oxidized. Preincubation with the lipoxygenase inhibitor 5,8,11,14-eicosatetraynoic acid (ETYA) completely abolished this arachidonate-induced tocopherol oxidation whereas cyclooxygenase inhibitors (indomethacin and aspirin) further potentiated tocopherol oxidation, indicating that this oxidation is closely linked with platelet 12-lipoxygenase activity. Incubation with lipoxygenase metabolites of arachidonic acid showed that only 12-HPETE caused a rapid tocopherol oxidation which was followed by a gradual tocopherol regeneration. By using nordihydroguaiaretic acid (NDGA), a lipoxygenase inhibitor which is also a strong reductant, over 60% of the arachidonate-induced oxidized tocopherol was regenerated. Tocopherol regeneration declined with increasing oxidation time induced by arachidonate, and after 30-60 min virtually no regeneration could be observed, suggesting that the precursor molecule was unstable. We postulate that the precursor molecule is the tocopheroxyl radical. In the presence of ETYA, a lipoxygenase inhibitor without antioxidant properties, either ascorbate or GSH provided significant tocopherol regeneration. Kinetic studies showed that tocopherol regeneration after the addition of ascorbate was essentially completed by 1 min. By contrast, GSH addition caused a steady increase in tocopherol which peaked after 10 min of its addition. To determine whether this rapid regeneration is chemical or enzymic, regeneration was studied in the presence of chloroform and methanol. Comparison of various reductants in this denaturing condition for enzymes showed that ascorbate and NDGA afforded significant regeneration whereas GSH was ineffective, indicating that there are distinct enzymic and non-enzymic mechanisms for tocopherol regeneration. This study provides direct evidence from mass analysis that tocopherol can be regenerated in human cell homogenates. This finding implies that maintenance of membrane tocopherol status may be an essential function of ascorbate and GSH which operate in concert to ensure maximum membrane protection against oxidative damage."

Purified IgG was digested with papain, resultant fragment antigen binding (Fab) fragments were reduced with 2-mercaptoethanol and alkylated with iodoacetamide, and light chains were purified by chromatography on immobilized antibodies to light chains and immobilized antibodies to heavy chains. Non-immunoglobulin components were undetectable in the light chain preparation, judged by sodium dodecyl sulfate-electrophoresis and Western blotting with anti-heavy and anti-light chain antibodies. The light chains hydrolyzed VIP with specific activity 32-fold greater than that of Fab, the pH optimum for light chain-mediated VIP hydrolysis was 7.0-7.5, and the hydrolytic activity was saturable (Vmax, 0.19 pmol/min/microgram light chains; substrate concentration at Vmax/2,380 nM)."
https://openalex.org/W1603281144,"We have studied the capacity of human neutrophils to release arachidonic acid from diacylglycerol, employing 1-stearoyl-2-[1-14C]arachidonoyl-sn-glycerol and 1-[1-14C]stearoyl-2-arachidonoyl-sn-glycerol as exogenous substrates. We have found that arachidonic acid is removed from diacylglycerol by the sequential action of two enzymes. First, the sn-1 position is split by 1-diacylglycerol lipase activity, and then, arachidonic acid is released from the resulting 2-monoacylglycerol by a 2-monoacylglycerol lipase. The specific activity of the 2-monoacylglycerol lipase, using 2-[1-14C]arachidonoyl-sn-glycerol as exogenous substrate, was at least 9-fold higher than that of 1-diacylglycerol lipase, indicating that the action of the 1-diacylglycerol lipase is the rate-limiting step in arachidonic acid release from diacylglycerol. Postnuclear supernatants from A23187-treated cells showed a 2.5-fold increase in both lipase activities. The arachidonic acid-releasing diacylglycerol lipase system showed an optimum pH of 4.5 and was not inhibited by EGTA or stimulated by Ca2+, Mg2+, Mn2+, Zn2+, or Co2+. However, arachidonic acid release was inhibited by Hg2+, suggesting the involvement of sulfhydryl groups in catalytic activity. The subcellular distribution of both 1-diacylglycerol lipase and 2-monoacylglycerol lipase activities was examined in resting and A23187-treated human neutrophils by fractionation of postnuclear supernatants on continuous sucrose gradients. Both lipases were localized mainly in the membrane of gelatinase-containing granules, which were resolved from cytosol, plasma membrane, phosphasomes, and specific and azurophilic granules. When neutrophils were stimulated by the calcium ionophore A23187, a drastic shift of the 1-diacylglycerol lipase and 2-monoacylglycerol lipase toward the plasma membrane was detected. This shift was due to fusion of gelatinase-containing granules with the plasma membrane upon neutrophil stimulation. As a result of the membrane fusion process, the capacity to release arachidonic acid from diacylglycerol was increased. This translocation from the membrane of gelatinase-containing granules to the plasma membrane may play an important role in regulating the diacylglycerol level in stimulated human neutrophils."
https://openalex.org/W1496360144,"smg p25A/rab3A p25 is a member of the small GTP-binding protein superfamily which is implicated in intracellular vesicle transport. smg p25A has a cDNA-predicted C-terminal structure of Cys-Ala-Cys. The protein purified from bovine brain membranes is geranylgeranylated at both the two cysteine residues and carboxyl-methylated at the C-terminal cysteine residue. Two types of prenyltransferase for small GTP-binding proteins have thus far been reported: ras p21 farnesyltransferase (ras p21 FT) and rhoA p21 geranylgeranyltransferase (rhoA p21 GGT). Neither of them geranylgeranylated smg p25A having a C-terminal Cys-Ala-Cys structure. In this paper, a smg p25A GGT was partially purified from bovine brain cytosol and separated from the ras p21 FT and rhoA p21 GGT by column chromatographies. smg p25A GGT transferred the geranylgeranyl moiety from geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate to both the two cysteine residues in the C-terminal Cys-Ala-Cys structure of smg p25A. smg p25A GGT did not use farnesyl pyrophosphate as a substrate and was also inactive on c-Ha-ras p21 and rhoA p21 with either farnesyl pyrophosphate or geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate as a substrate. These results indicate that there are at least three types of prenyltransferase for small GTP-binding proteins in mammalian tissues."
https://openalex.org/W1593107348,"The pigment cell-specific gene, located at the brown (b) locus in mouse, has been cloned and characterized. Its gene product is required for the formation of black melanin rather than brown, although its exact function remains to be elucidated. We thus tentatively named it b-locus protein in this report. The b-locus protein gene is about 18 kilobase pairs long and organized into 8 exons and 7 introns. Functional analysis of its promoter region suggests that the nucleotide residues -38/154 is sufficient to direct the pigment cell-specific transcription in melanoma whole cell extracts. On the other hand, we were unable to detect its transcripts in HeLa whole cell extracts. Sequence comparison with the promoter region of the tyrosinase gene, another pigment cell-specific gene, reveals that two elements of the b-locus protein gene (-33/-24 and 18/28) are also conserved in the tyrosinase gene at equivalent positions, suggesting that these two elements may be involved in their pigment cell-specific transcription. Furthermore, we have cloned a cDNA, pMT3, coding for an isoform of b-locus protein from a cDNA library of mouse B16 melanoma cells. Sequence analysis of pMT3 reveals a deletion of 103 base pairs, which corresponds to the 5'-end of the exon 8 of the b-locus protein gene, indicating that pMT3 represents a mRNA species generated by alternative splicing. Since this deletion changes the reading frame and eliminates the transmembrane domain of b-locus protein, the pMT3-type mRNA may code for a soluble isoform. Such an isoform, consisting of 553 amino acids, differs only in its carboxyl terminus and is larger than b-locus protein by 16 amino acids. Using transient expression assays, we confirmed that such an isoform is able to react with anti-b-locus protein monoclonal antibody, TMH-1, suggesting that a b-locus protein isoform may have some function in pigmentation."
https://openalex.org/W1543755352,"Ornithine aminotransferase (OAT) is a mitochondrial enzyme expressed at high levels in liver, kidney, and retina. To characterize OAT regulation in retinal lines, we have been studying OAT synthesis in retinoblastomas RB355 and Y79. Our previous data (Fagan, R.J., Sheffield, W.P., and Rozen, R. (1989) J. Biol. Chem. 264, 20513-20517) indicated similar OAT mRNA levels in the two strains with 3-fold greater immunoreactive OAT protein and enzyme activity in Y79. To examine the regulatory mechanisms in these cell lines, we performed nuclear runoff experiments and characterized polysome-associated OAT mRNAs. The nuclear runoff data did not reveal any differences in transcription between the two strains. However, OAT mRNA of the RB355 strain was present in the lighter polysome fractions as compared with Y79. Treatment with cycloheximide, which slows the rate of elongation, indicated that initiation was decreased in RB355. Eukaryotic initiation factor eIF-4E mRNA and protein were reduced in RB355, suggesting that eIF-4E might be rate-limiting for OAT translation. Overexpression of a wild-type eIF-4E in RB355 shifted the OAT mRNA into denser fractions of the gradient and increased the amount of OAT protein to the level observed in Y79; overexpression of a mutant eIF-4E had no such effect. We previously identified an alternatively spliced OAT mRNA (containing exon 2) in these cells. This mRNA appeared in the lightest fractions of the gradient in both strains and was not affected by eIF-4E overexpression."
https://openalex.org/W1496336500,"We have found that TA1-R6, which are resistant to the cytotoxic effects of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) in the presence of cycloheximide (Reid, T. R., Torti, F., and Ringold, G. M. (1989) J. Biol. Chem. 264, 4583-4589), have reduced ability to release arachidonic acid (20:4) from membrane phospholipids in response to either TNF or the calcium ionophore A23187 treatment. However, no defect in the activity of phospholipase A2, the principal enzyme responsible for the release of 20:4 from phospholipids, was observed in these cells. Detailed biochemical characterization of these TNF-resistant cells has revealed that these cells are unable to synthesize 20:4 endogenously because of a defect in delta 6-desaturase, the rate-limiting enzyme of 20:4 biosynthesis. This deficiency leads to a marked decrease in the steady-state levels of 20:4 present in choline-containing phospholipid (PC) and ethanolamine-containing phospholipid (PE). The TA1-R6 cells, however, are capable of incorporating exogenous 20:4 into PC and PE, and when loaded in such manner they become significantly more sensitive to the cytotoxic effects of TNF in the presence of cycloheximide. Therefore, the release of arachidonic acid from phospholipids appears to be a critical element in the signaling pathway utilized by TNF and is essential to the rapid cytotoxic response elicited by TNF in the absence of protein synthesis in wild-type TA1 cells."
https://openalex.org/W1565791135,"p70 S6 kinase, a major insulin-mitogen-activated ribosomal S6 protein kinase in mammalian cells, is activated by phosphorylation of multiple Ser/Thr residues on the enzyme polypeptide. A synthetic peptide, corresponding to a 37-residue segment from the carboxyl-terminal tail of the kinase which resembles the sequence phosphorylated in S6, acts as a competitive inhibitor of p70 S6 kinase without itself being phosphorylated by the enzyme. This synthetic peptide is phosphorylated by an array of protein kinases which are rapidly activated by insulin. Thus, these sequences of p70 S6 kinase constitute a potential autoinhibitory pseudosubstrate site, whose phosphorylation is catalyzed by candidate upstream-activating protein kinases."
https://openalex.org/W1670114215,"Messenger RNA levels for the alpha subunit of G-proteins expressed in adipocytes of lean and obese (ob/ob) mice were compared with relative levels of the encoded proteins. Using both toxin labeling and Western blots, expression of Gs alpha, Gi alpha-1, and Gi alpha-3 was decreased by approximately 2-fold in adipocytes of obese mice, while levels of Gi alpha-2 did not differ between the phenotypes. The decreases in Gi alpha-1 and Gs alpha in the obese mouse were attributed to decreased mRNA levels for these proteins. Similar mRNA levels for Gi alpha-3 were noted in both phenotypes, but Gi alpha-2 message was increased 2-fold in the obese mouse. Inhibitory regulation of adipocyte adenylylcyclase through G-proteins was evaluated by comparing the ability of R-PIA to inhibit isoproterenol-stimulated responses between the phenotypes. In spite of the decrease in Gi alpha-1 and Gi alpha-3 in adipocytes from obese mice, R-PIA inhibited adenylylcyclase, cAMP-dependent protein kinase, and lipolysis in similar fashion in both phenotypes. The GTP analog, Gpp(NH)p also inhibited forskolin-stimulated adenylylcyclase in a comparable manner, but the magnitude of the inhibition was slightly less in adipocyte membranes from obese mice. In contrast, the decrease in expression of Gs alpha was translated into substantially poorer activation of isoproterenol-stimulated responses in the obese mouse. The concentration of isoproterenol producing half-maximal activation of adenylylcyclase, protein kinase, and lipolysis did not differ between the phenotypes, but the maximal responses were much lower in cells from obese mice. Similar lipolytic potential in isolated adipocytes from each phenotype and similar total forskolin-stimulated cyclase activity in adipocyte membranes from each phenotype suggest that decreased expression of Gs alpha may contribute to the characteristic alteration in mobilization of triglycerides noted in adipocytes from obese mice."
https://openalex.org/W1523484838,"Abstract Substitution of glycine for arginine at position 127 of the mature human interleukin 1 beta protein generates a mutant IL-1 beta protein (IL-1 beta R----G) which binds cellular IL-1 receptors with high affinity but fails to elicit significant proliferation of T-helper cells (Gehrke, L., Jobling, S. A., Paik, L. S. K., McDonald, B., Rosenwasser, L. J., and Auron, P. E. (1990) J. Biol. Chem. 265, 5922-5925). Although both IL-1 beta and the IL-1 beta R----G mutein stimulate transcription of fibroblast immediate early (fos and jun) and early (IL-1 beta and IL-6) genes, the IL-1 beta R----G mutein, in contrast to the wild-type IL-1 beta protein, induces minimal or no transcription of late genes such as procollagenase and prostromelysin. The effect of the naturally occurring IL-1 receptor antagonist protein (IL-1ra) on fibroblast transcription is distinct from that of the IL-1 beta R----G mutein, for the IL-1ra fails to stimulate not only late (procollagenase and prostromelysin) but also immediate early (fos and jun) gene expression. These data suggest that the IL-I beta R----G mutein triggers an incomplete or defective signal transduction cascade and demonstrate that fibroblast fos and jun expression is not necessarily accompanied by increased transcription of genes containing the AP-1 binding site. These data also suggest that at least two events are required for IL-1-mediated late gene induction in fibroblasts."
https://openalex.org/W1521993545,"Reported differences in the primary structures of chicken muscle troponin C (Wilkinson, J.M. (1976) FEBS Lett. 70, 254-256) and recombinant protein deduced from a chick muscle cDNA (Reinach, F.C. and Karlsson, R. (1988) J. Biol. Chem. 263, 2371-2376) have been reinvestigated. The complete amino acid sequence of turkey muscle troponin C has also been elucidated. Residue 100, originally reported as Asp in the chicken muscle protein, is shown to be Asn in all three structures. The three amino acid sequences are identical except as follows: 1) the blocked NH2-terminal Ala at residue 1 of the chicken protein is replaced by nonblocked Met-Ala in the recombinant protein and by nonblocked Pro in turkey troponin-C; 2) residue 130 is Thr in both avian muscle proteins but Ile in the recombinant protein; 3) Asp-133 in the chicken muscle and recombinant troponins-C is replaced by Glu in the turkey protein; 4) residue 99, originally identified as Glu in the x-ray structure of the turkey protein, is shown to be Ala in all three proteins. Calcium titration of the metal-induced conformational transition of the protein as monitored by far UV CD measurements indicated a significant decrease in Ca2+ affinity of the high-affinity sites in the case of the recombinant protein as compared with the chicken muscle protein. Both pairs of sites showed high cooperativity. That this decreased Ca2+ affinity could be attributed to different amino acid residues at position 130 and not to the differences at the NH2 termini was confirmed by site-specific mutation of Ile-130 to Thr in the recombinant protein. The mutated recombinant protein now titrated identically to the chicken muscle protein. Thr-130, whereas over 21 A from the metal of sites III and IV, is involved in a hydrogen bonding network with structured water and the NH2-terminal region of helix G."
https://openalex.org/W1608907028,"We have studied the role of Drosophila 35-kDa cap-binding protein (CBP) and CBP complex in the mechanism of messenger RNA discrimination established in heat-shocked Drosophila embryos. Drosophila 35-kDa CBP is functionally equivalent to the mammalian eucaryotic initiation factor (eIF)-4E and CBP complex, which includes eIF-4E, might be the counterpart of mammalian eIF-4F. By using anti-eIF-4E antibodies, we found that although translation of the bulk of normal messengers in Drosophila lysates was very dependent on eIF-4E, the mRNAs for the heat shock proteins (hsps) (particularly hsp70 mRNA and with the exception of hsp83 mRNA) were translated almost independently of this factor, suggesting that they may have unstructured leaders. Accordingly, hsp70 mRNA and, to a lesser extent, the mRNAs for the small hsps were found to be more resistant to inhibition by K+ than normal and hsp83 mRNAs. Moreover, Drosophila CBP complex was able to rescue partial but specifically the synthesis of normal proteins when added to a lysate from heat-shocked embryos. However, no significant effect was obtained by Drosophila eIF-4E or eIF-2. Consistent with these results, we found a great decrease in the amount of the CBP complex purified from heat-shocked embryos as compared with normal ones, whereas the amounts of free eIF-4E purified from either source were similar. Together, the above results suggest that some modification leading to the disruption of Drosophila CBP complex may account, at least to some extent, for the mRNA discrimination established in heat-shocked Drosophila embryos."
https://openalex.org/W1575936937,"The kinetics of O2 and CO binding to R-state human hemoglobin A0 and human hemoglobin cross-linked between the alpha chains at Lys99 residues were examined using ligand displacement and partial photolysis techniques. Oxygen equilibrium curves were measured by Imai's continuous recording method (Imai, K. (1981) Methods Enzymol. 76, 438-449). The rate of the R to T transition was determined after full laser photolysis of the carbon monoxide derivative by measuring the resultant absorbance changes at an isosbestic point for ligand binding. Chemical cross-linking caused the R-state O2 affinity of alpha subunits to decrease 6-fold compared with unmodified hemoglobin. This inhibition of O2 binding was the result of both a decrease in the rate constant for ligand association and an increase in the rate constant for dissociation. The O2 affinity of R-state beta subunits was reduced 2-fold because of an increase in the O2 dissociation rate constant. These changes were attributed to proximal effects on the R-state hemes as the result of the covalent cross-link between alpha chain G helices. This proximal strain in cross-linked hemoglobin was also expressed as a 5-fold higher rate for the unliganded R to T allosteric transition. The fourth O2 equilibrium binding constant, K4, measured by kinetic techniques, could be used to analyze equilibrium curves for either native or cross-linked hemoglobin. The resultant fitted values of the Adair constants, a1, a2, and a3 were similar to those obtained when K4 was allowed to vary, and the fits were of equal quality. When K4 was fixed to the kinetically determined value, the remaining Adair constants, particularly a3, became better defined."
https://openalex.org/W1498996826,"Lysine 234 is a residue highly conserved in all beta-lactamases, except in the carbenicillin-hydrolyzing enzymes, in which it is replaced by an arginine. Informational suppression has been used to create amino acid substitutions at this position in the broad spectrum Escherichia coli beta-lactamase TEM-1, in order to elucidate the role of this residue which lies on the wall at the closed end of the active site cavity. The mutants K234R and K234T were constructed and their kinetic constants measured. Replacement of lysine 234 by arginine yields an enzyme with similar activity toward cephalosporins and most penicillins, except toward the carboxypenicillins for which the presence of the guanidine group enhances the transition state binding. The removal of the basic group in the mutant K234T yields a protein variant which retains a low activity toward penicillins, but losts drastically its ability to hydrolyze cephalosporins. Moreover, these two mutations largely decreased the affinity of the enzyme for penicillins (10-fold for K234R and 50-fold for K234T). This can be correlated with the disruption of the predicted electrostatic binding between the C3 carboxylic group of penicillins and the amine function of the lysine. Therefore, lysine 234 in the E. coli beta-lactamase TEM-1 is involved both in the initial recognition of the substrate and in transition state stabilization."
https://openalex.org/W1485382463,"3-Hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase (HMG-CoA reductase), the rate-limiting enzyme in the biosynthesis of cholesterol and isoprenoids, is subject to rapid degradation which is regulated by mevalonate (MVA)-derived metabolic products. HMG-CoA reductase is an integral membrane protein of the endoplasmic reticulum, the largest nonmitochondrial pool of cellular Ca2+. To assess the possible role of Ca2+ in the regulated degradation of HMG-CoA reductase, we perturbed cellular Ca2+ concentration and followed the fate of HMG-CoA reductase and of HMGal, a fusion protein consisting of the membrane domain of HMG-CoA reductase and the soluble bacterial enzyme beta-galactosidase. The degradation of HMGal mirrors that of HMG-CoA reductase, demonstrating that the membrane domain of HMG-CoA reductase is sufficient to confer regulated degradation (Skalnik, D.G., Narita, H., Kent, C., and Simoni, R.D. (1988) J. Biol. Chem. 263, 6836-6841; Chun, K.T., Bar-Nun, S., and Simoni, R.D. (1990) J. Biol. Chem. 265, 22004-22010). In this study we show that the MVA-dependent accelerated rates of degradation of HMG-CoA reductase and HMGal in cells maintained in Ca(2+)-free medium are 2-3-fold slower than the rate of degradation in cells grown in high (1.8-2 mM) Ca2+ concentration. This effect is reversed upon addition of Ca2+ to the medium. Furthermore, when cells maintained in high Ca2+ are treated with 1 microM ionomycin, the MVA-dependent accelerated degradation of HMG-CoA reductase and HMGal is also reduced about 2-3-fold. This inhibition is not due to a Ca(2+)-dependent uptake or incorporation of MVA into sterols, since these processes are not affected in the absence of external Ca2+. In addition, cobalt, a known antagonist of Ca(2+)-dependent cellular functions, totally abolishes (IC50 = 520 microM in the presence of 1.8 mM extracellular Ca2+) the MVA-accelerated degradation of HMGal. These results suggest that Ca2+ plays a major role in the regulated degradation of HMG-CoA reductase."
https://openalex.org/W1495540876,"Abstract The cellular levels of the three translational initiation factors, IF1, IF2, and IF3, increase as a function of growth rate in parallel with those of ribosomes. Therefore both ribosomal and initiation factor gene expression is under metabolic control. To address how expression of the Escherichia coli gene for IF1, infA, is regulated, a 3-kilobase region of the genome surrounding infA was sequenced. The 5' and 3' termini of in vivo infA transcripts were defined by S1 nuclease mapping, and mRNA size was measured by Northern blot hybridization. The infA gene is transcribed by two promoters, P1 and P2, which generate transcripts of 525 and 330 nucleotides, apparently ending at the same rho-independent terminator. Analyses of operon and protein fusions to lacZ demonstrate that neither infA transcription nor translation is affected by high cellular levels of IF1. However, P2, but not P1, increases in activity as a function of the growth rate of the cell and is the dominant promoter in rich medium. Therefore, metabolic control of infA expression occurs exclusively at the level of transcription by the P2 promoter."
https://openalex.org/W1647543588,"The Rsr1 protein of Saccharomyces cerevisiae has been shown to be essential for bud site selection (Bender, A., and Pringle, J. (1989) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 86, 9976-9980). This protein of 272 amino acids shares approximately 50% sequence identity with both Ras and Rap GTPases. However, neither GTP binding nor GTPase activity of the Rsr1 protein has been reported. The Rsr1 protein shares with human Rap1 GTPases the four specific motifs, i.e. Gly-12, residues 32-40, Ala-59, and residues 64-70, that are required for GAP3-dependent activation of the Rap1 GTPases. In this paper we demonstrate that the intrinsic GTPase activity of the Rsr1 protein is stimulated by GAP3 purified from bovine brain cytosol. The Rsr1 GTPase is not activated by either GAP1 or GAP2 which are specific for the Ras and Rho GTPases, respectively. Thus, it appears that the Rsr1 GTPase is a new member of the Rap1 GTPase family. Replacement of Gly-12 by Val in the Rsr1 GTPase completely abolishes the GAP3-dependent activation. The chimeric GTPases, Ras(1-60)/Rsr1(61-168) and Rsr1(1-65)/Ras(66-189), are activated by GAP3 but not by GAP1. Replacement of Thr-65 by Ser in the latter chimeric GTPase completely abolishes the GAP3-dependent activation, indicating that Thr-65 is required for distinguishing GAP3 from GAP1. We have previously shown that Gln-61 and Ser-65 are sufficient to determine the GAP1 specificity. Replacement of Thr-35 by Ala in the common effector domain (residues 32-40) of the chimeric Ras/Rsr1 GTPases completely abolishes GAP3-dependent activation."
https://openalex.org/W1498099530,"Factor IXLong Beach has a single amino acid substitution at 397 (Ile to Thr) in the catalytic domain which results in severe hemophilia B. Recent investigations have shown that the substitution of threonine for isoleucine at 397 may affect a part of the macromolecular substrate binding site. Because threonine has a hydroxyl group in its side chain, it is possible that this hydroxyl group makes new hydrogen bonds and disturbs the substrate binding site. We used three techniques: molecular biology, which includes site-directed mutagenesis and recombinant protein expression in tissue culture; computer-aided kinetic data analysis; and molecular modeling to study this mutation site. We have produced two mutant factor IX molecules that have isoleucine 397 replaced by valine or threonine. Factor IXwild type and the two mutants (factor IXVal and factor IXThr) were expressed in human kidney cells and purified using a conformation-specific monoclonal antibody column. After the activation by factor XIa, these three molecules were able to bind p-aminobenzamidine and increase its fluorescence intensity in a similar manner. Factor IXVal and factor IXwild type had indistinguishable activities in an activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) assay and similar kinetic parameters with factor X as a substrate. Factor IXThr had only 5% clotting activity compared with normal factor IX, a slightly lower Km and significantly reduced kcat, using factor X as a substrate. We developed energy-refined (AMBER v.3.1) computer models of the three factor IX molecules based on previous work. Three factor IXa models (Ile, Val, or Thr at 397) with a fragment of the factor X activation site were used to predict the effect of the mutation at 397 and evaluate the significance of the new hydrogen bond thought to form between the side chain hydroxyl group of threonine 397 and the carbonyl oxygen of tryptophan 385. This new hydrogen bond would affect the position of an amide proton of adjacent glycine 386 which has been proposed to make a hydrogen bond with a backbone carbonyl oxygen of the P3 residue of factor X. In addition to the new hydrogen bond, there is significant movement in the side chain of tryptophan 385 between the factor IXawild type-factor X model and the factor IXaThr-factor X model that could interfere with substrate binding. This movement could be caused by the change in the molecular volume, the orientation of the side chain at 397, and the new hydrogen bond."

Corticospinal axons in both phenotypes traverse the medulla within a well-defined pyramidal tract, decussate within several fascicles at the spinomedullary junction, and extend down the spinal cord in a compact bundle in the ventral-most part of the dorsal funiculus. Very few labeled fibers are seen separated from the main bundle. This normal configuration of the corticospinal tract is attained despite the virtual absence of CNS myelin in jimpy mice. It seems unlikely then that the myelin normally present in fiber bundles adjacent to this relatively late emerging projection can significantly influence pathway selection during its development."
https://openalex.org/W1521938915,"We describe the heterologous expression of a recombinant Saccharomyces cerevisiae isoleucyl-tRNA synthetase (IRS) gene in Escherichia coli, as well as the purification and characterization of the recombinant gene product. High level expression of the yeast isoleucyl-tRNA synthetase gene was facilitated by site-specific mutagenesis. The putative ribosome-binding site of the yeast IRS gene was made to be the consensus of many highly expressed genes of E. coli. Mutagenesis simultaneously created a unique BclI restriction site such that the gene coding region could be conveniently subcloned as a cassette. The variant gene was cloned into the expression vector pKK223-3 (Brosius, J., and Holy, A. (1984) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 81, 6929-6933) thereby creating the plasmid pKR4 in which yeast IRS expression is under the control of the isopropyl-thio-beta-galactopyranoside (IPTG)-inducible tac promoter. Recombinant yeast IRS, on the order of 10 mg/liter of cell culture, was purified from pKR4-infected and IPTG-induced E. coli strain TG2. Yeast IRS was purified to homogeneity by a combination of anion-exchange and hydroxyapatite gel chromatography. Inhibition of yeast IRS activity by the antibiotic pseudomonic acid A was tested. The yeast IRS enzyme was found to be 10(4) times less sensitive to inhibition by pseudomonic acid A (Ki = 1.5 x 10(-5) M) than the E. coli enzyme. E. coli strain TG2 infected with pKR4, and induced with IPTG, had a plating efficiency of 100% at inhibitor concentrations in excess of 25 micrograms/ml. At the same concentration of pseudomonic acid A, E. coli strain TG2 infected with pKK223-3 had a plating efficiency less than 1%. The ability of yeast IRS to rescue E. coli from pseudomonic acid A suggests that the eukaryotic synthetase has full activity in its prokaryotic host and has specificity for E. coli tRNA(ile)."
https://openalex.org/W1528309569,"Abstract In CD4+ T cells, the src-like tyrosine kinase pp56lck is associated with the CD4 receptor and cross-linking of CD4 results in the activation of this enzyme. The mechanism responsible for this activation is not known, although there is evidence that the activities of the src family of enzymes are regulated by tyrosine phosphorylation. Here we report that pp56lck-catalyzed angiotensin II phosphorylations are activated 20-fold in vitro by synthetic peptides reproducing portions of the murine CD4 cytoplasmic domain. This activation is described by a dissociation constant of about 2 microM. The pp56lck-catalyzed phosphorylation of other peptide substrates are effected less and in one case not at all by the peptide modulators, indicating that these CD4 sequences alter the substrate specificity of pp56lck. In contrast, peptides reproducing sequences from the CD8 receptor have a charge and size similar to the CD4 peptides, yet are vastly less effective at modulating pp56lck activities. High ionic strengths inhibit the CD4 peptide-induced modulation of pp56lck phosphotransferase activities, suggesting that charge-charge interactions are important for this process. In addition, the modulation of pp56lck activities by peptides reproducing the CD4 cytoplasmic domain are reproduced by polycations significantly larger than the CD4 cytoplasmic domain but not by those of similar size. The modulations both by CD4 peptides and the polycations do not depend on enzyme tyrosine phosphorylations."
https://openalex.org/W1607658753,"The transport routes for threonine in a primate kidney epithelial cell line (BSC-1) grown as monolayer in continuous cell culture were studied. We discovered at least four different transport systems for threonine uptake. The Na(+)-dependent route shows biphasic kinetics with a low and high affinity parameter. The apparent kinetic constants for Km1 and Km2 were 0.3 and 36 mM with apparent Vmax values of 6.3 and 90 nmol/mg protein/min, respectively. The high affinity, low Km component resembles system ASC activity, with respect to substrate selectivity. The Na(+)-independent route also exhibits biphasic kinetics. A high affinity component (apparent Km of 1.0 mM, and apparent Vmax of 7.2 nmol/mg protein/min) is sensitive to inhibition by leucine and the aminoendolevo-rotatory isomer of 2-aminobicyclo[2,2,1]heptane-2-carboxylic acid, suggesting participation by system L. The low affinity component (apparent Km of 10.2 mM, and apparent Vmax of 71 nmol/mg protein/min) was specifically inhibited by threonine, serine, and alanine and could be assigned to system asc. The discrimination between system L and asc is based upon differences in pH sensitivity, trans stimulation, and Ki values. In addition, the effects of harmaline, a suspected sodium transport site inhibitor, have been studied. Harmaline noncompetitively inhibited Na(+)-dependent threonine uptake but had no effect on Na(+)-independent transport of threonine. This report is the first to present evidence for the presence of system asc in renal epithelial cells. The physiological and biochemical significance of our findings are discussed."

The current studies investigate the intracellular mechanisms by which gonadotropins regulate gene expression. Primary cultures of rat granulosa cells were transfected with the plasmid POMC-CAT-150, which expresses the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) reporter gene under the regulation of the rat POMC 5'-flanking region. CAT activity was stimulated by treatment of the cells with either 20 ng/ml FSH or 1 microM isoproterenol. To assess the role of protein kinase A (ATP:protein phosphotransferase; EC 2.7.1.37) in the gonadotropin and adrenergic response, an expression vector, MtR-AB, encoding a mutant RI regulatory subunit was cotransfected with POMC-CAT-150. The mutant protein kinase A regulatory subunit encoded by MtR-AB lacks functional cAMP-binding sites but effectively binds and specifically inhibits the catalytic activity of protein kinase A. The results of this analysis demonstrated that gonadotropin and adrenergic agonist stimulation of the POMC-CAT reporter construct in primary cultures of rat granulosa cells were abolished by cotransfection with MtR-AB; whereas a control SV40-promoter construct was unaffected by either gonadotropin treatment or cotransfection with MtR-AB. Basal expression directed by the POMC promoter was also decreased by cotransfection with the MtR-AB, implying that basal expression from the POMC promoter may also depend on protein kinase A. Deletion analysis of the POMC sequence indicated regions (-40 to -33 and +4 to +63) important for basal and FSH-stimulated expression. These studies suggest that both gonadotropin and adrenergic stimulation of the POMC promoter are mediated by protein kinase A and that regions proximal to the promoter are essential for gonadotropin-regulated expression from the promoter."
