https://openalex.org/W1968458420,"Next generation sequencing (NGS) technologies provide a high-throughput means to generate large amount of sequence data. However, quality control (QC) of sequence data generated from these technologies is extremely important for meaningful downstream analysis. Further, highly efficient and fast processing tools are required to handle the large volume of datasets. Here, we have developed an application, NGS QC Toolkit, for quality check and filtering of high-quality data. This toolkit is a standalone and open source application freely available at http://www.nipgr.res.in/ngsqctoolkit.html. All the tools in the application have been implemented in Perl programming language. The toolkit is comprised of user-friendly tools for QC of sequencing data generated using Roche 454 and Illumina platforms, and additional tools to aid QC (sequence format converter and trimming tools) and analysis (statistics tools). A variety of options have been provided to facilitate the QC at user-defined parameters. The toolkit is expected to be very useful for the QC of NGS data to facilitate better downstream analysis."
https://openalex.org/W2053082937,"Tauopathy in the brain of patients with Alzheimer's disease starts in the entorhinal cortex (EC) and spreads anatomically in a defined pattern. To test whether pathology initiating in the EC spreads through the brain along synaptically connected circuits, we have generated a transgenic mouse model that differentially expresses pathological human tau in the EC and we have examined the distribution of tau pathology at different timepoints. In relatively young mice (10–11 months old), human tau was present in some cell bodies, but it was mostly observed in axons within the superficial layers of the medial and lateral EC, and at the terminal zones of the perforant pathway. In old mice (>22 months old), intense human tau immunoreactivity was readily detected not only in neurons in the superficial layers of the EC, but also in the subiculum, a substantial number of hippocampal pyramidal neurons especially in CA1, and in dentate gyrus granule cells. Scattered immunoreactive neurons were also seen in the deeper layers of the EC and in perirhinal and secondary somatosensory cortex. Immunoreactivity with the conformation-specific tau antibody MC1 correlated with the accumulation of argyrophilic material seen in old, but not young mice. In old mice, axonal human tau immunoreactivity, especially at the endzones of the perforant pathway, was greatly reduced. Relocalization of tau from axons to somatodendritic compartments and propagation of tauopathy to regions outside of the EC correlated with mature tangle formation in neurons in the EC as revealed by thioflavin-S staining. Our data demonstrate propagation of pathology from the EC and support a trans-synaptic mechanism of spread along anatomically connected networks, between connected and vulnerable neurons. In general, the mouse recapitulates the tauopathy that defines the early stages of AD and provides a model for testing mechanisms and functional outcomes associated with disease progression."
https://openalex.org/W2023381648,"Pathogenic mutations in APP, PSEN1, PSEN2, MAPT and GRN have previously been linked to familial early onset forms of dementia. Mutation screening in these genes has been performed in either very small series or in single families with late onset AD (LOAD). Similarly, studies in single families have reported mutations in MAPT and GRN associated with clinical AD but no systematic screen of a large dataset has been performed to determine how frequently this occurs. We report sequence data for 439 probands from late-onset AD families with a history of four or more affected individuals. Sixty sequenced individuals (13.7%) carried a novel or pathogenic mutation. Eight pathogenic variants, (one each in APP and MAPT, two in PSEN1 and four in GRN) three of which are novel, were found in 14 samples. Thirteen additional variants, present in 23 families, did not segregate with disease, but the frequency of these variants is higher in AD cases than controls, indicating that these variants may also modify risk for disease. The frequency of rare variants in these genes in this series is significantly higher than in the 1,000 genome project (p = 5.09 × 10⁻⁵; OR = 2.21; 95%CI = 1.49-3.28) or an unselected population of 12,481 samples (p = 6.82 × 10⁻⁵; OR = 2.19; 95%CI = 1.347-3.26). Rare coding variants in APP, PSEN1 and PSEN2, increase risk for or cause late onset AD. The presence of variants in these genes in LOAD and early-onset AD demonstrates that factors other than the mutation can impact the age at onset and penetrance of at least some variants associated with AD. MAPT and GRN mutations can be found in clinical series of AD most likely due to misdiagnosis. This study clearly demonstrates that rare variants in these genes could explain an important proportion of genetic heritability of AD, which is not detected by GWAS."
https://openalex.org/W2029913563,"Pannexin 1 (PANX1) channels mediate release of ATP, a ""find-me"" signal that recruits macrophages to apoptotic cells; PANX1 activation during apoptosis requires caspase-mediated cleavage of PANX1 at its C terminus, but how the C terminus inhibits basal channel activity is not understood. Here, we provide evidence suggesting that the C terminus interacts with the human PANX1 (hPANX1) pore and that cleavage-mediated channel activation requires disruption of this inhibitory interaction. Basally silent hPANX1 channels localized on the cell membrane could be activated directly by protease-mediated C-terminal cleavage, without additional apoptotic effectors. By serial deletion, we identified a C-terminal region just distal to the caspase cleavage site that is required for inhibition of hPANX1; point mutations within this small region resulted in partial activation of full-length hPANX1. Consistent with the C-terminal tail functioning as a pore blocker, we found that truncated and constitutively active hPANX1 channels could be inhibited, in trans, by the isolated hPANX1 C terminus either in cells or when applied directly as a purified peptide in inside-out patch recordings. Furthermore, using a cysteine cross-linking approach, we showed that relief of inhibition following cleavage requires dissociation of the C terminus from the channel pore. Collectively, these data suggest a mechanism of hPANX1 channel regulation whereby the intact, pore-associated C terminus inhibits the full-length hPANX1 channel and a remarkably well placed caspase cleavage site allows effective removal of key inhibitory C-terminal determinants to activate hPANX1."
https://openalex.org/W1972126235,"Viruses have evolved elaborate mechanisms to evade or inactivate the complex system of sensors and signaling molecules that make up the host innate immune response. Here we show that human coronavirus (HCoV) NL63 and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) CoV papain-like proteases (PLP) antagonize innate immune signaling mediated by STING (stimulator of interferon genes, also known as MITA/ERIS/MYPS). STING resides in the endoplasmic reticulum and upon activation, forms dimers which assemble with MAVS, TBK-1 and IKKε, leading to IRF-3 activation and subsequent induction of interferon (IFN). We found that expression of the membrane anchored PLP domain from human HCoV-NL63 (PLP2-TM) or SARS-CoV (PLpro-TM) inhibits STING-mediated activation of IRF-3 nuclear translocation and induction of IRF-3 dependent promoters. Both catalytically active and inactive forms of CoV PLPs co-immunoprecipitated with STING, and viral replicase proteins co-localize with STING in HCoV-NL63-infected cells. Ectopic expression of catalytically active PLP2-TM blocks STING dimer formation and negatively regulates assembly of STING-MAVS-TBK1/IKKε complexes required for activation of IRF-3. STING dimerization was also substantially reduced in cells infected with SARS-CoV. Furthermore, the level of ubiquitinated forms of STING, RIG-I, TBK1 and IRF-3 are reduced in cells expressing wild type or catalytic mutants of PLP2-TM, likely contributing to disruption of signaling required for IFN induction. These results describe a new mechanism used by CoVs in which CoV PLPs negatively regulate antiviral defenses by disrupting the STING-mediated IFN induction."
https://openalex.org/W2164278804,"Recurrent chromosomal translocations underlie both haematopoietic and solid tumours. Their origin has been ascribed to selection of random rearrangements, targeted DNA damage, or frequent nuclear interactions between translocation partners; however, the relative contribution of each of these elements has not been measured directly or on a large scale. Here we examine the role of nuclear architecture and frequency of DNA damage in the genesis of chromosomal translocations by measuring these parameters simultaneously in cultured mouse B lymphocytes. In the absence of recurrent DNA damage, translocations between Igh or Myc and all other genes are directly related to their contact frequency. Conversely, translocations associated with recurrent site-directed DNA damage are proportional to the rate of DNA break formation, as measured by replication protein A accumulation at the site of damage. Thus, non-targeted rearrangements reflect nuclear organization whereas DNA break formation governs the location and frequency of recurrent translocations, including those driving B-cell malignancies. A genome-wide analysis determines the contribution of DNA breaks and nuclear interactions to the formation of random versus recurrent translocations; whereas random translocations follow nuclear interaction profiles, the frequency of recurrent translocations is directly proportional to the amount of DNA damage at translocation partners. Translocations — events that swap the arms of two different chromosomes — are found in many cancers. It is thought that they occur when the interaction sites become close in nuclear space. Rafael Casellas and colleagues have now done a genome-wide analysis to determine the contribution of DNA breaks to the formation of random and recurrent translocations. Whereas random translocations are found to be highly sensitive to nuclear interactions between chromosomes, the frequency of recurrent translocations, including those involved in human cancer, is proportional to the amount of DNA damage at these highly utilized sites."
https://openalex.org/W2062503073,"The maximum size and age that clonal organisms can reach remains poorly known, although we do know that the largest natural clones can extend over hundreds or thousands of metres and potentially live for centuries. We made a review of findings to date, which reveal that the maximum clone age and size estimates reported in the literature are typically limited by the scale of sampling, and may grossly underestimate the maximum age and size of clonal organisms. A case study presented here shows the occurrence of clones of slow-growing marine angiosperm Posidonia oceanica at spatial scales ranging from metres to hundreds of kilometres, using microsatellites on 1544 sampling units from a total of 40 locations across the Mediterranean Sea. This analysis revealed the presence, with a prevalence of 3.5 to 8.9%, of very large clones spreading over one to several (up to 15) kilometres at the different locations. Using estimates from field studies and models of the clonal growth of P. oceanica, we estimated these large clones to be hundreds to thousands of years old, suggesting the evolution of general purpose genotypes with large phenotypic plasticity in this species. These results, obtained combining genetics, demography and model-based calculations, question present knowledge and understanding of the spreading capacity and life span of plant clones. These findings call for further research on these life history traits associated with clonality, considering their possible ecological and evolutionary implications."
https://openalex.org/W2157355372,"Synthesis, storage, and turnover of triacylglycerols (TAGs) in adipocytes are critical cellular processes to maintain lipid and energy homeostasis in mammals. TAGs are stored in metabolically highly dynamic lipid droplets (LDs), which are believed to undergo fragmentation and fusion under lipolytic and lipogenic conditions, respectively. Time lapse fluorescence microscopy showed that stimulation of lipolysis in 3T3-L1 adipocytes causes progressive shrinkage and almost complete degradation of all cellular LDs but without any detectable fragmentation into micro-LDs (mLDs). However, mLDs were rapidly formed after induction of lipolysis in the absence of BSA in the culture medium that acts as a fatty acid scavenger. Moreover, mLD formation was blocked by the acyl-CoA synthetase inhibitor triacsin C, implicating that mLDs are synthesized de novo in response to cellular fatty acid overload. Using label-free coherent anti-Stokes Raman scattering microscopy, we demonstrate that LDs grow by transfer of lipids from one organelle to another. Notably, this lipid transfer between closely associated LDs is not a rapid and spontaneous process but rather occurs over several h and does not appear to require physical interaction over large LD surface areas. These data indicate that LD growth is a highly regulated process leading to the heterogeneous LD size distribution within and between individual cells. Our findings suggest that lipolysis and lipogenesis occur in parallel in a cell to prevent cellular fatty acid overflow. Furthermore, we propose that formation of large LDs requires a yet uncharacterized protein machinery mediating LD interaction and lipid transfer."
https://openalex.org/W2161373285,"The anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family of proteins, including Bcl-2, Bcl-XL and Mcl-1, are well-validated drug targets for cancer treatment. Several small molecules have been designed to interfere with Bcl-2 and its fellow pro-survival family members. While ABT-737 and its orally active analog ABT-263 are the most potent and specific inhibitors to date that bind Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL with high affinity but have a much lower affinity for Mcl-1, they are not very effective as single agents in certain cancer types because of elevated levels of Mcl-1. Accordingly, compounds that specifically target Mcl-1 may overcome this resistance. In this study, we identified and characterized the natural product marinopyrrole A as a novel Mcl-1-specific inhibitor and named it maritoclax. We found that maritoclax binds to Mcl-1, but not Bcl-XL, and is able to disrupt the interaction between Bim and Mcl-1. Moreover, maritoclax induces Mcl-1 degradation via the proteasome system, which is associated with the pro-apoptotic activity of maritoclax. Importantly, maritoclax selectively kills Mcl-1-dependent, but not Bcl-2- or Bcl-XL-dependent, leukemia cells and markedly enhances the efficacy of ABT-737 against hematologic malignancies, including K562, Raji, and multidrug-resistant HL60/VCR, by ∼60- to 2000-fold at 1–2 μm. Taken together, these results suggest that maritoclax represents a new class of Mcl-1 inhibitors, which antagonizes Mcl-1 and overcomes ABT-737 resistance by targeting Mcl-1 for degradation.

https://openalex.org/W2019794323,"Background RNAi can be achieved in insect herbivores by feeding them host plants stably transformed to express double stranded RNA (dsRNA) of selected midgut-expressed genes. However, the development of stably transformed plants is a slow and laborious process and here we developed a rapid, reliable and transient method. We used viral vectors to produce dsRNA in the host plant Nicotiana attenuata to transiently silence midgut genes of the plant's lepidopteran specialist herbivore, Manduca sexta. To compare the efficacy of longer, undiced dsRNA for insect gene silencing, we silenced N. attenuata's dicer genes (NaDCL1- 4) in all combinations in a plant stably transformed to express dsRNA targeting an insect gene. Methodology/Principal Findings Stable transgenic N. attenuata plants harboring a 312 bp fragment of MsCYP6B46 in an inverted repeat orientation (ir-CYP6B46) were generated to produce CYP6B46 dsRNA. After consuming these plants, transcripts of CYP6B46 were significantly reduced in M. sexta larval midguts. The same 312 bp cDNA was cloned in an antisense orientation into a TRV vector and Agro-infiltrated into N. attenuata plants. When larvae ingested these plants, similar reductions in CYP6B46 transcripts were observed without reducing transcripts of the most closely related MsCYP6B45. We used this transient method to rapidly silence the expression of two additional midgut-expressed MsCYPs. CYP6B46 transcripts were further reduced in midguts, when the larvae fed on ir-CYP6B46 plants transiently silenced for two combinations of NaDCLs (DCL1/3/4 and DCL2/3/4) and contained higher concentrations of longer, undiced CYP6B46 dsRNA. Conclusions Both stable and transient expression of CYP6B46 dsRNA in host plants provides a specific and robust means of silencing this gene in M. sexta larvae, but the transient system is better suited for high throughput analyses. Transiently silencing NaDCLs in ir-CYP6B46 plants increased the silencing of MsCYP6B46, suggested that insect's RNAi machinery is more efficient with longer lengths of ingested dsRNA."
https://openalex.org/W2160033413,"Cellular O-linked N-acetylglucosamine (O-GlcNAc) levels are modulated by two enzymes: uridine diphosphate-N-acetyl-D-glucosamine:polypeptidyltransferase (OGT) and O-GlcNAcase (OGA). To quantitatively address the activity of these enzymes on protein substrates, we generated five structurally diverse proteins in both unmodified and O-GlcNAc-modified states. We found a remarkably invariant upper limit for k(cat)/K(m) values for human OGA (hOGA)-catalyzed processing of these modified proteins, which suggests that hOGA processing is driven by the GlcNAc moiety and is independent of the protein. Human OGT (hOGT) activity ranged more widely, by up to 15-fold, suggesting that hOGT is the senior partner in fine tuning protein O-GlcNAc levels. This was supported by the observation that K(m,app) values for UDP-GlcNAc varied considerably (from 1 μM to over 20 μM), depending on the protein substrate, suggesting that some OGT substrates will be nutrient-responsive, whereas others are constitutively modified. The ratios of k(cat)/K(m) values obtained from hOGT and hOGA kinetic studies enable a prediction of the dynamic equilibrium position of O-GlcNAc levels that can be recapitulated in vitro and suggest the relative O-GlcNAc stoichiometries of target proteins in the absence of other factors. We show that changes in the specific activities of hOGT and hOGA measured in vitro on calcium/calmodulin-dependent kinase IV (CaMKIV) and its pseudophosphorylated form can account for previously reported changes in CaMKIV O-GlcNAc levels observed in cells. These studies provide kinetic evidence for the interplay between O-GlcNAc and phosphorylation on proteins and indicate that these effects can be mediated by changes in hOGT and hOGA kinetic activity."
https://openalex.org/W2009450284,"Thiourea tasting can be predictive of individual differences in bitter taste responses, general food preferences and eating behavior, and could be correlated with saliva chemical composition. We investigated the possible relationship between PROP bitter taste responsiveness and the salivary proteome in subjects genotyped for TAS2R38 and gustin gene polymorphisms. Taste perception intensity evoked by PROP and NaCl solutions was measured in sixty-three volunteers (21 males, 42 females, age 25±3 y) to establish their PROP taster status, and 24 PROP super-tasters and 21 nontasters were selected to participate in the study. TAS2R38 and gustin gene molecular analysis were performed using PCR techniques. Qualitative and quantitative determination of salivary proteins was performed by HPLC-ESI-MS before and after PROP taste stimulation. PROP super-tastings was strongly associated with the ‘taster’ variant (PAV haplotype) of TAS2R38 and the A allele of rs2274333 polymorphism in the gustin gene and nontasting was associated with the minor alleles at both loci. ANOVA revealed that basal levels of II-2 and Ps-1 proteins, belonging to the basic proline-rich protein (bPRPs) family, were significantly higher in PROP super-taster than in nontaster un-stimulated saliva, and that PROP stimulation elicited a rapid increase in the levels of these same proteins only in PROP super-taster saliva. These data show for the first time that responsiveness to PROP is associated with salivary levels of II-2 peptide and Ps-1 protein, which are products of the PRB1 gene. These findings suggest that PRB1, in addition to TAS2R38 and gustin, could contribute to individual differences in thiourea sensitivity, and the expression of the PROP phenotype as a complex genetic trait."
https://openalex.org/W2127936692,"Numerous studies have shown that people adjust their intake directly to that of their eating companions; they eat more when others eat more, and less when others inhibit intake. A potential explanation for this modeling effect is that both eating companions' food intake becomes synchronized through processes of behavioral mimicry. No study, however, has tested whether behavioral mimicry can partially account for this modeling effect. To capture behavioral mimicry, real-time observations of dyads of young females having an evening meal were conducted. It was assessed whether mimicry depended on the time of the interaction and on the person who took the bite. A total of 70 young female dyads took part in the study, from which the total number of bites (N = 3,888) was used as unit of analyses. For each dyad, the total number of bites and the exact time at which each person took a bite were coded. Behavioral mimicry was operationalized as a bite taken within a fixed 5-second interval after the other person had taken a bite, whereas non-mimicked bites were defined as bites taken outside the 5-second interval. It was found that both women mimicked each other's eating behavior. They were more likely to take a bite of their meal in congruence with their eating companion rather than eating at their own pace. This behavioral mimicry was found to be more prominent at the beginning than at the end of the interaction. This study suggests that behavioral mimicry may partially account for social modeling of food intake."
https://openalex.org/W2006339817,"Familial Alzheimer disease (FAD) is linked to mutations in the presenilin (PS) homologs. FAD mutant PS expression has several cellular consequences, including exaggerated intracellular Ca2+ ([Ca2+]i) signaling due to enhanced agonist sensitivity and increased magnitude of [Ca2+]i signals. The mechanisms underlying these phenomena remain controversial. It has been proposed that PSs are constitutively active, passive endoplasmic reticulum (ER) Ca2+ leak channels and that FAD PS mutations disrupt this function resulting in ER store overfilling that increases the driving force for release upon ER Ca2+ release channel opening. To investigate this hypothesis, we employed multiple Ca2+ imaging protocols and indicators to directly measure ER Ca2+ dynamics in several cell systems. However, we did not observe consistent evidence that PSs act as ER Ca2+ leak channels. Nevertheless, we confirmed observations made using indirect measurements employed in previous reports that proposed this hypothesis. Specifically, cells lacking PS or expressing a FAD-linked PS mutation displayed increased area under the ionomycin-induced [Ca2+]i versus time curve (AI) compared with cells expressing WT PS. However, an ER-targeted Ca2+ indicator revealed that this did not reflect overloaded ER stores. Monensin pretreatment selectively attenuated the AI in cells lacking PS or expressing a FAD PS allele.

https://openalex.org/W2069823876,"p21(Waf1/Cip1/Sdi1) is a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor that mediates cell cycle arrest. Prolonged p21 up-regulation induces a senescent phenotype in normal and cancer cells, accompanied by an increase in intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS). However, it has been shown recently that p21 expression can also lead to cell death in certain models. The mechanisms involved in this process are not fully understood. Here, we describe an induction of apoptosis by p21 in sarcoma cell lines that is p53-independent and can be ameliorated with antioxidants. Similar levels of p21 and ROS caused senescence in the absence of significant death in other cancer cell lines, suggesting a cell-specific response. We also found that cells undergoing p21-dependent cell death had higher sensitivity to oxidants and a specific pattern of mitochondrial polarization changes. Consistent with this, apoptosis could be blocked with targeted expression of catalase in the mitochondria of these cells. We propose that the balance between cancer cell death and arrest after p21 up-regulation depends on the specific effects of p21-induced ROS on the mitochondria. This suggests that selective up-regulation of p21 in cancer cells could be a successful therapeutic intervention for sarcomas and tumors with lower resistance to mitochondrial oxidative damage, regardless of p53 status."
https://openalex.org/W2168766514,"The different forms of flowers in a species have attracted the attention of many evolutionary biologists, including Charles Darwin. In Fagopyrum esculentum (common buckwheat), the occurrence of dimorphic flowers, namely short-styled and long-styled flowers, is associated with a type of self-incompatibility (SI) called heteromorphic SI. The floral morphology and intra-morph incompatibility are both determined by a single genetic locus named the S-locus. Plants with short-styled flowers are heterozygous (S/s) and plants with long-styled flowers are homozygous recessive (s/s) at the S-locus. Despite recent progress in our understanding of the molecular basis of flower development and plant SI systems, the molecular mechanisms underlying heteromorphic SI remain unresolved. By examining differentially expressed genes from the styles of the two floral morphs, we identified a gene that is expressed only in short-styled plants. The novel gene identified was completely linked to the S-locus in a linkage analysis of 1,373 plants and had homology to EARLY FLOWERING 3. We named this gene S-LOCUS EARLY FLOWERING 3 (S-ELF3). In an ion-beam-induced mutant that harbored a deletion in the genomic region spanning S-ELF3, a phenotype shift from short-styled flowers to long-styled flowers was observed. Furthermore, S-ELF3 was present in the genome of short-styled plants and absent from that of long-styled plants both in world-wide landraces of buckwheat and in two distantly related Fagopyrum species that exhibit heteromorphic SI. Moreover, independent disruptions of S-ELF3 were detected in a recently emerged self-compatible Fagopyrum species and a self-compatible line of buckwheat. The nonessential role of S-ELF3 in the survival of individuals and the prolonged evolutionary presence only in the genomes of short-styled plants exhibiting heteromorphic SI suggests that S-ELF3 is a suitable candidate gene for the control of the short-styled phenotype of buckwheat plants."
https://openalex.org/W2025342270,"Cognitive decline during aging is correlated with a continuous loss of cells within the brain and especially within the hippocampus, which could be regenerated by adult neurogenesis. Here we show that genetic ablation of NF-κB resulted in severe defects in the neurogenic region (dentate gyrus) of the hippocampus. Despite increased stem cell proliferation, axogenesis, synaptogenesis and neuroprotection were hampered, leading to disruption of the mossy fiber pathway and to atrophy of the dentate gyrus during aging. Here, NF-κB controls the transcription of FOXO1 and PKA, regulating axogenesis. Structural defects culminated in behavioral impairments in pattern separation. Re-activation of NF-κB resulted in integration of newborn neurons, finally to regeneration of the dentate gyrus, accompanied by a complete recovery of structural and behavioral defects. These data identify NF-κB as a crucial regulator of dentate gyrus tissue homeostasis suggesting NF-κB to be a therapeutic target for treating cognitive and mood disorders."
https://openalex.org/W2020362719,"Dendritic cells (DCs) are critical mediators of immunity and immune tolerance by orchestrating multiple aspects of T cell activation and function. Immature DCs (iDCs) expressing low levels of co-stimulatory receptors are highly efficient at antigen capture but are poor activators of T cells. Maturation of DCs is associated with increased expression of co-stimulatory molecules. Co-stimulatory receptor gene expression is regulated by intracellular redox, NF-κB, and MAPK pathways and by histone deacetylase (HDAC) activity. The transcription factor, Nrf2, is important for maintaining intracellular glutathione (GSH) levels and redox homeostasis and has been implicated in modulating DC co-stimulatory receptor expression. It is unclear whether Nrf2 mediates this effect by GSH-dependent mechanisms and whether it influences DC signaling pathways. Using bone marrow-derived iDCs from Nrf2(+/+) and Nrf2(-/-) mice, we demonstrate that Nrf2(-/-) iDCs have lower basal GSH levels, enhanced co-stimulatory receptor expression, impaired phagocytic functions, and increased antigen-specific CD8 T cell stimulation capacity. Interestingly, lowering GSH levels in Nrf2(+/+) iDCs did not recapitulate the Nrf2(-/-) iDC phenotype. Loss of Nrf2 resulted in elevated basal levels of reactive oxygen species but did not affect basal NF-κB activity or p38 MAPK phosphorylation. Using pharmacological inhibitors, we demonstrate that enhanced co-stimulatory receptor phenotype of Nrf2(-/-) iDC does not require ERK activity but is dependent on HDAC activity, indicating a potential interaction between Nrf2 function and HDAC. These results suggest that Nrf2 activity is required to counter rises in intracellular reactive oxygen species and to regulate pathways that control DC co-stimulatory receptor expression."
https://openalex.org/W2032451465,"ERM (ezrin, radixin, and moesin) proteins are cytoskeletal interacting proteins that bind cortical actin, the plasma membrane, and membrane proteins, which are found in specialized plasma membrane structures such as microvilli and filopodia. ERM proteins are regulated by phosphatidylinositol 4, 5-biphosphate (PIP(2)) and by phosphorylation of a C-terminal threonine, and its inactivation involves PIP(2) hydrolysis and/or myosin phosphatase (MP). Recently, we demonstrated that ERM proteins are also subject to counter regulation by the bioactive sphingolipids ceramide and sphingosine 1-phosphate. Plasma membrane ceramide induces ERM dephosphorylation whereas sphingosine 1-phosphate induces their phosphorylation. In this work, we pursue the mechanisms by which ceramide regulates dephosphorylation. We found that this dephosphorylation was independent of hydrolysis and localization of PIP(2) and MP. However, the results show that ERM dephosphorylation was blocked by treatment with protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) pharmacological inhibitors and specifically by siRNA to PP1α, whereas okadaic acid, a PP2A inhibitor, failed. Moreover, a catalytic inactive mutant of PP1α acted as dominant negative of the endogenous PP1α. Additional results showed that the ceramide mechanism of PP1α activation is largely independent of PIP(2) hydrolysis and MP. Taken together, these results demonstrate a novel, acute mechanism of ERM regulation dependent on PP1α and plasma membrane ceramide."

Here, we extend this paradigm of lectin-mediated innate immunity, showing that REG3γ expression is triggered by CagA in the H. pylori-infected stomach.In human gastric mucosal tissues, REG3γ expression was significantly increased in CagA-positive, compared to CagA-negative H. pylori infected individuals. Using transfected CagA-inducible gastric MKN28 cells, we recapitulated REG3γ induction in vitro, also showing that tyrosine phosphorylated, not unphosphorylated CagA triggers REG3γ transcription. In concert with induced REG3γ, pro-inflammatory signalling downstream of the gp130 cytokine co-receptor via the signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT)3 and transcription of two cognate ligands, interleukin(IL)-11 and IL-6, were significantly increased. Exogenous IL-11, but not IL-6, directly stimulated STAT3 activation and REG3γ transcription. STAT3 siRNA knockdown or IL-11 receptor blockade respectively abrogated or subdued CagA-dependent REG3γ mRNA induction, thus demonstrating a requirement for uncompromised signalling via the IL-11/STAT3 pathway. Inhibition of the gp130-related SHP2-(Ras)-ERK pathway did not affect CagA-dependent REG3γ induction, but strengthened STAT3 activation as well as augmenting transcription of mucosal innate immune regulators, IL-6, IL-8 and interferon-response factor (IRF)1.Our results support a model of CagA-directed REG3γ expression in gastric epithelial cells via activation of the IL-11/gp130/STAT3 pathway. This response might allow Gram-negative H. pylori to manipulate host immunity to favour its own survival, by reducing the fitness of co-habiting Gram-positive bacteria with which it competes for resources in the gastric mucosal niche."
https://openalex.org/W2044109050,"How carbon flux differentially occurs in vascular plants following photosynthesis for protein formation, phenylpropanoid metabolism (i.e. lignins), and other metabolic processes is not well understood. Our previous discovery/deduction that a six-membered arogenate dehydratase (ADT1-6) gene family encodes the final step in Phe biosynthesis in Arabidopsis thaliana raised the fascinating question whether individual ADT isoenzymes (or combinations thereof) differentially modulated carbon flux to lignins, proteins, etc. If so, unlike all other lignin pathway manipulations that target cell wall/cytosolic processes, this would be the first example of a plastid (chloroplast)-associated metabolic process influencing cell wall formation. Homozygous T-DNA insertion lines were thus obtained for five of the six ADTs and used to generate double, triple, and quadruple knockouts (KOs) in different combinations. The various mutants so obtained gave phenotypes with profound but distinct reductions in lignin amounts, encompassing a range spanning from near wild type levels to reductions of up to ∼68%. In the various KOs, there were also marked changes in guaiacyl:syringyl ratios ranging from ∼3:1 to 1:1, respectively; these changes were attributed to differential carbon flux into vascular bundles versus that into fiber cells. Laser microscope dissection/pyrolysis GC/MS, histochemical staining/lignin analyses, and pADT::GUS localization indicated that ADT5 preferentially affects carbon flux into the vascular bundles, whereas the adt3456 knock-out additionally greatly reduced carbon flux into fiber cells. This plastid-localized metabolic step can thus profoundly differentially affect carbon flux into lignins in distinct anatomical regions and provides incisive new insight into different factors affecting guaiacyl:syringyl ratios and lignin primary structure."
https://openalex.org/W2085771982,"Ezh2 is a histone trimethyltransferase that silences genes mainly via catalyzing trimethylation of histone 3 lysine 27 (H3K27Me3). The role of Ezh2 as a regulator of gene silencing and cell proliferation in cancer development has been extensively investigated; however, its function in heart development during embryonic cardiogenesis has not been well studied. In the present study, we used a genetically modified mouse system in which Ezh2 was specifically ablated in the mouse heart. We identified a wide spectrum of cardiovascular malformations in the Ezh2 mutant mice, which collectively led to perinatal death. In the Ezh2 mutant heart, the endocardial cushions (ECs) were hypoplastic and the endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) process was impaired. The hearts of Ezh2 mutant mice also exhibited decreased cardiomyocyte proliferation and increased apoptosis. We further identified that the Hey2 gene, which is important for cardiomyocyte proliferation and cardiac morphogenesis, is a downstream target of Ezh2. The regulation of Hey2 expression by Ezh2 may be independent of Notch signaling activity. Our work defines an indispensible role of the chromatin remodeling factor Ezh2 in normal cardiovascular development."
https://openalex.org/W2163579288,"Cigarette smoke (CS) causes sustained lung inflammation, which is an important event in the pathogenesis of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). We have previously reported that IKKα (I kappaB kinase alpha) plays a key role in CS-induced pro-inflammatory gene transcription by chromatin modifications; however, the underlying role of downstream signaling kinase is not known. Mitogen- and stress-activated kinase 1 (MSK1) serves as a specific downstream NF-κB RelA/p65 kinase, mediating transcriptional activation of NF-κB-dependent pro-inflammatory genes. The role of MSK1 in nuclear signaling and chromatin modifications is not known, particularly in response to environmental stimuli. We hypothesized that MSK1 regulates chromatin modifications of pro-inflammatory gene promoters in response to CS. Here, we report that CS extract activates MSK1 in human lung epithelial (H292 and BEAS-2B) cell lines, human primary small airway epithelial cells (SAEC), and in mouse lung, resulting in phosphorylation of nuclear MSK1 (Thr581), phospho-acetylation of RelA/p65 at Ser276 and Lys310 respectively. This event was associated with phospho-acetylation of histone H3 (Ser10/Lys9) and acetylation of histone H4 (Lys12). MSK1 N- and C-terminal kinase-dead mutants, MSK1 siRNA-mediated knock-down in transiently transfected H292 cells, and MSK1 stable knock-down mouse embryonic fibroblasts significantly reduced CS extract-induced MSK1, NF-κB RelA/p65 activation, and posttranslational modifications of histones. CS extract/CS promotes the direct interaction of MSK1 with RelA/p65 and p300 in epithelial cells and in mouse lung. Furthermore, CS-mediated recruitment of MSK1 and its substrates to the promoters of NF-κB-dependent pro-inflammatory genes leads to transcriptional activation, as determined by chromatin immunoprecipitation. Thus, MSK1 is an important downstream kinase involved in CS-induced NF-κB activation and chromatin modifications, which have implications in pathogenesis of COPD."
https://openalex.org/W2092882111,"In migrating animals protandry is the phenomenon whereby males of a species arrive at the breeding grounds earlier than females. In the present study we investigated the proximate causes of protandry in a migratory songbird, the northern wheatear Oenanthe oenanthe. Previous experiments with caged birds revealed that males and females show differentiated photoperiod-induced migratory habits. However, it remained open whether protandry would still occur without photoperiodic cues. In this study we kept captive first-year birds under constant photoperiod and environmental conditions in a ""common garden"" experiment. Male northern wheatears started their spring migratory activity earlier than females, even in the absence of environmental cues. This indicates that protandry in the northern wheatear has an endogenous basis with an innate earlier spring departure of males than females."
https://openalex.org/W2129703339,"The antihemostatic/antiangiogenic protein tablysin-15 is a member of the CAP (cysteine-rich secretory, antigen 5, and pathogenesis-related 1 protein) superfamily and has been shown to bind the integrins α(IIb)β(3) and α(V)β(3) by means of an Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) tripeptide sequence. Here we describe the x-ray crystal structure of tablysin-15 and show that the RGD motif is located in a novel structural context. The motif itself is contained in a type II β-turn structure that is similar in its conformation to the RGD sequence of the cyclic pentapeptide cilengitide when bound to integrin α(V)β(3). The CAP domain also contains a hydrophobic channel that appears to bind a fatty acid molecule in the crystal structure after purification from Escherichia coli. After delipidation of the protein, tablysin-15 was found to bind proinflammatory cysteinyl leukotrienes with submicromolar affinities. The structure of the leukotriene E(4)-tablysin-15 complex shows that the ligand binds with the nonfunctionalized end of the fatty acid chain buried in the hydrophobic pocket, whereas the carboxylate end of the ligand binds forms hydrogen bond/salt bridge interactions with polar side chains at the channel entrance. Therefore, tablysin-15 functions as an inhibitor of integrin function and as an anti-inflammatory scavenger of eicosanoids."
https://openalex.org/W2101063944,"Pacific herring embryos (Clupea pallasi) spawned three months following the Cosco Busan bunker oil spill in San Francisco Bay showed high rates of late embryonic mortality in the intertidal zone at oiled sites. Dead embryos developed to the hatching stage (e.g. fully pigmented eyes) before suffering extensive tissue deterioration. In contrast, embryos incubated subtidally at oiled sites showed evidence of sublethal oil exposure (petroleum-induced cardiac toxicity) with very low rates of mortality. These field findings suggested an enhancement of oil toxicity through an interaction between oil and another environmental stressor in the intertidal zone, such as higher levels of sunlight-derived ultraviolet (UV) radiation. We tested this hypothesis by exposing herring embryos to both trace levels of weathered Cosco Busan bunker oil and sunlight, with and without protection from UV radiation. Cosco Busan oil and UV co-exposure were both necessary and sufficient to induce an acutely lethal necrotic syndrome in hatching stage embryos that closely mimicked the condition of dead embryos sampled from oiled sites. Tissue levels of known phototoxic polycyclic aromatic compounds were too low to explain the observed degree of phototoxicity, indicating the presence of other unidentified or unmeasured phototoxic compounds derived from bunker oil. These findings provide a parsimonious explanation for the unexpectedly high losses of intertidal herring spawn following the Cosco Busan spill. The chemical composition and associated toxicity of bunker oils should be more thoroughly evaluated to better understand and anticipate the ecological impacts of vessel-derived spills associated with an expanding global transportation network."
https://openalex.org/W2039261563,"Despite evidence that antitumor immunity can be protective against renal cell carcinoma (RCC), few patients respond objectively to immunotherapy and the disease is fatal once metastases develop. We asked to what extent combinatorial immunotherapy with Adenovirus-encoded murine TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (Ad5mTRAIL) plus CpG oligonucleotide, given at the primary tumor site, would prove efficacious against metastatic murine RCC. To quantitate primary renal and metastatic tumor growth in mice, we developed a luciferase-expressing Renca cell line, and monitored tumor burdens via bioluminescent imaging. Orthotopic tumor challenge gave rise to aggressive primary tumors and lung metastases that were detectable by day 7. Intra-renal administration of Ad5mTRAIL+CpG on day 7 led to an influx of effector phenotype CD4 and CD8 T cells into the kidney by day 12 and regression of established primary renal tumors. Intra-renal immunotherapy also led to systemic immune responses characterized by splenomegaly, elevated serum IgG levels, increased CD4 and CD8 T cell infiltration into the lungs, and elimination of metastatic lung tumors. Tumor regression was primarily dependent upon CD8 T cells and resulted in prolonged survival of treated mice. Thus, local administration of Ad5mTRAIL+CpG at the primary tumor site can initiate CD8-dependent systemic immunity that is sufficient to cause regression of metastatic lung tumors. A similar approach may prove beneficial for patients with metastatic RCC."

The project ran from 1995 to 2006, and we used remote sensing Normalized Differential Vegetation Index data from 1982 to 2009 to compare project grazing sites to matched control sites before and after the project's implementation. We found that the productivity of project grazing sites was on average within 1% of control sites for the 20 years before the project but generated 11% more biomass on average than the control areas from 2000 to 2009. To better understand the benefits of the improved grasslands to local people, we conducted 280 household interviews, 8 focus group discussions, and 31 key informant interviews across 6 districts. We found a 12% greater median annual income as well as a range of other socioeconomic benefits for project households compared to control households in the same areas. Overall, the project generated measurable benefits to both nature and people. The key factors underlying project achievements that may be replicable by other conservation projects include the community-driven approach of the project, knowledge exchanges within and between communities inside and outside the country, a project-supported local community organizer in each district, and strong community leadership."
https://openalex.org/W2035198213,"Isotopic discrimination and turn-over are fundamental to the application of stable isotope ecology in animals. However, detailed information for specific tissues and species are widely lacking, notably for herbivorous species. We provide details on tissue-specific carbon and nitrogen discrimination and turn-over times from food to blood, feathers, claws, egg tissues and offspring down feathers in four species of herbivorous waterbirds. Source-to-tissue discrimination factors for carbon (δ¹³C) and nitrogen stable isotope ratios (δ¹⁵N) showed little variation across species but varied between tissues. Apparent discrimination factors ranged between -0.5 to 2.5‰ for δ¹³C and 2.8 to 5.2‰ for δ¹⁵N, and were more similar between blood components than between keratinous tissues or egg tissue. Comparing these results with published data from other species we found no effect of foraging guild on discrimination factors for carbon but a significant foraging-guild effect for nitrogen discrimination factors.Turn-over of δ¹³C in tissues was most rapid in blood plasma, with a half-life of 4.3 d, whereas δ¹³C in blood cells had a half-life of approximately 32 d. Turn-over times for albumen and yolk in laying females were similar to those of blood plasma, at 3.2 and 6.0 d respectively. Within yolk, we found decreasing half-life times of δ¹³C from inner yolk (13.3 d) to outer yolk (3.1 d), related to the temporal pattern of tissue formation.We found similarities in tissue-specific turn-over times across all avian species studied to date. Yet, while generalities regarding discrimination factors and tissue turn-over times can be made, a large amount of variation remains unexplained."
https://openalex.org/W2095194802,"Male mating signals, including ornaments and courtship displays, and other sexually selected traits, like male-male aggression, are largely controlled by sex hormones. Environmental pollutants, notably endocrine disrupting compounds, can interfere with the proper functioning of hormones, thereby impacting the expression of hormonally regulated traits. Atrazine, one of the most widely used herbicides, can alter sex hormone levels in exposed animals. I tested the effects of environmentally relevant atrazine exposures on mating signals and behaviors in male guppies, a sexually dimorphic freshwater fish. Prolonged atrazine exposure reduced the expression of two honest signals: the area of orange spots (ornaments) and the number of courtship displays performed. Atrazine exposure also reduced aggression towards competing males in the context of mate competition. In the wild, exposure levels vary among individuals because of differential distribution of the pollutants across habitats; hence, differently impacted males often compete for the same mates. Disrupted mating signals can reduce reproductive success as females avoid mating with perceptibly suboptimal males. Less aggressive males are at a competitive disadvantage and lose access to females. This study highlights the effects of atrazine on ecologically relevant mating signals and behaviors in exposed wildlife. Altered reproductive traits have important implications for population dynamics, evolutionary patterns, and conservation of wildlife species."

In addition, but through a distinct pathway, PSGL-1 engagement activates ERK.

IntroductionLeukocyte migration into inflammatory lesions is tightly regulated by adhesion receptors and mediators of inflammation. Selectins play a critical role in initiating the leukocyte adhesion cascade by mediating leukocyte tethering and rolling along inflamed vascular endothelium or on adherent platelets/leukocytes (1Ley K.

In preliminary experiments performed with CHO cells, we observed that alanine substitution of these residues strongly impaired cell recruitment on P-selectin. More detailed studies were then performed with 32D murine leukocytes to examine the involvement of the EBS in leukocyte tethering, rolling, and signaling. Deletion or mutation of EBS strongly reduced leukocyte capture and recruitment on selectins. Syk phosphorylation and αLβ2-dependent leukocyte slow rolling on E-selectin plus ICAM-1 have not been affected either by deletion of EBS or by alanine substitution of Ser-336, Arg-337, and Lys-338, indicating that they are not required to activate Syk. Because PSGL-1 engagement also activates MAPK pathway (15Hidari K.I. Weyrich A.S. Zimmerman G.A. McEver R.P.

To further investigate the role of the EBS in cell rolling on selectins, we performed preliminary experiments with CHO cells expressing a mutant form of PSGL-1, in which Ser-336, Arg-337, and Lys-338 (SRK) were substituted with alanines (PSGL-1 S336A/R337A/K338A; AAA mutant) (Fig. 1A). We compared the ability of CHO cells expressing WT PSGL-1 or AAA mutant to bind to and roll on P-selectin.Additional experiments were then performed with 32D leukocytes expressing 1) ΔEBS PSGL-1, devoid of Ser-336 to Val-344 residues forming the EBS or 2) AAA mutant or SAA mutant, the latter exhibiting alanine substitution of Arg-337 and Lys-338 (Figs. 1A and 2). We confirmed with 32D transfectants the involvement of EBS in leukocyte recruitment on P-selectin and extended our observations to L- and E-selectin. Using this leukocyte cell line, which was more appropriate than CHO cells for signal transduction studies, we examined whether EBS deletion or mutations 1) decrease leukocyte tethering and rolling on L-, P-, and E-selectin, 2) reduce rolling stability on L-selectin, 3) prevent slow rolling on E-selectin plus ICAM-1, or 4) impair PSGL-1-induced Syk or ERK activation.Mutation of SRK Amino Acid Residues of EBS Does Not Affect PSGL-1 Binding to P-selectin/μ ChimeraAs a prerequisite for flow adhesion assays, we analyzed P-selectin/μ chimera binding to CHO cells expressing WT PSGL-1 or AAA mutant to ensure that EBS mutations did not affect selectin binding to PSGL-1 N terminus (31Bernimoulin M.P.

Flow cytometric analysis showed that equivalent levels of P-selectin bound to WT PSGL-1 or AAA mutant (Fig. 1C), which is consistent with unmodified P-selectin binding activity.SRK Mutations Impair CHO Cell Recruitment on P-selectin without Affecting Cell Rolling VelocityCHO cells expressing matched surface levels of WT PSGL-1 or AAA mutant (Fig. 1B) were compared side-by-side in rolling assays to assess cell recruitment and rolling velocities under shear stress conditions that mimic leukocyte-endothelial interactions in postcapillary venules. CHO cells expressing WT PSGL-1 exhibited efficient tethering and rolling between 1.0 and 2.0 dynes/cm2. The specificity of PSGL-1 interactions with P-selectin was demonstrated by the abrogation of cell recruitment in the presence of blocking mAbs KPL1 or WAPS12.2, directed against PSGL-1 or P-selectin, respectively. Mock-transfected cells did not interact with P-selectin, and selectin-mediated rolling was abolished by EDTA (data not shown).Ala substitution of Ser-336, Arg-337, and Lys-338 residues in AAA mutant inhibited CHO cell recruitment on P-selectin by 45% (Fig. 1D, p < 0.001). However, the median rolling velocity (mrv) was not affected (6.3 versus 6.7 μm/s for WT PSGL-1 versus AAA mutant, respectively; Fig. 1E). The lack of significant effect of SRK mutations on rolling velocity is consistent with the hypothesis that velocity is mainly determined by receptor off-rate (33Krasik E.F. Hammer D.A.

Transfectants with matched expression of WT PSGL-1 or ΔEBS mutant (Figs. 1A and 2A) bound equivalent levels of L- or P-selectin/μ chimera (Fig. 2, B and C). Compared with WT PSGL1 transfectants, the recruitment of leukocytes expressing ΔEBS mutant was reduced by 43% on L-selectin, 77% on P-selectin, and 85% on E-selectin (Fig. 3A; p < 0.001), and the mrv increased by 1.7-fold on L-selectin and by 1.3-fold on P- and E-selectin (Fig. 3B; p < 0.001).FIGURE 3EBS deletion impairs 32D leukocyte rolling on selectins and increases rolling velocity.

Leukocytes were tracked within successive video frames (40 ms) for 2 s (Fig. 4A); peaks correspond to acceleration, and valleys correspond to deceleration (28Tauxe C. Xie X. Joffraud M. Martinez M. Schapira M. Spertini O. P-selectin glycoprotein ligand-1 decameric repeats regulate selectin-dependent rolling under flow conditions.J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 28536-28545Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Dashed lines indicate mrv, which was included within percentiles 40 and 60 of the velocity curves illustrated on Fig. 3B. The stability of rolling velocity is indicated by the mean S.D. ± S.D. of tracked cell velocities (28Tauxe C. Xie X. Joffraud M. Martinez M. Schapira M. Spertini O.

Chem. 2008; 283: 28536-28545Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Cell displacements are the most stable, with low peaks and shallow valleys, for WT transfectants, which displayed a mean stability of rolling velocity on L-selectin of 30.7 ± 8.6 (Fig. 4A, left). By contrast, cells expressing ΔEBS mutant rolled faster and significantly less stably (mean S.D. ± S.D., 53.9 ± 16.7; p < 0.001; Fig. 4A, middle).The distribution of distances traveled by all examined 32D leukocytes illustrates how unstable displacements are correlated with longer rolling distances (Fig. 4B). Indeed, 86% of WT PSGL-1 cells traveled less than 4 μm on L-selectin within 40-ms periods, whereas only 48% of cells expressing ΔEBS mutant did. These results indicated that PSGL-1 EBS contributes to stabilize leukocyte rolling.SRK or RK Mutations Impair Leukocyte Recruitment on SelectinsAdditional flow adhesion assays were performed to determine whether SRK mutations 1) affect 32D leukocyte recruitment and 2) mimic the effects of EBS deletion. The recruitment of transfectants expressing AAA or SAA mutants was strongly impaired on L-selectin (AAA or SAA: 29 or 40% inhibition, respectively; p < 0.001, AAA or SAA compared with WT), P-selectin (58 or 47% inhibition; p < 0.001), and E-selectin (77 or 58% inhibition; p < 0.001). A key role was observed for Arg-337 and Lys-338, whose substitution by Ala inhibited cell recruitment on L-, P-, and E-selectin to a similar extent as SRK substitution (Fig. 5A). However, compared with transfectants expressing ΔEBS PSGL-1, the recruitment on L-, P-, or E-selectin of AAA or SAA transfectants was less affected (p <"
https://openalex.org/W2093252832,"Extinction is an integral part of normal healthy fear responses, while it is compromised in several fear-related mental conditions in humans, such as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Although much research has recently been focused on fear extinction, its molecular and cellular underpinnings are still unclear. The development of animal models for extinction will greatly enhance our approaches to studying its neural circuits and the mechanisms involved. Here, we describe two gene-knockout mouse lines, one with impaired and another with enhanced extinction of learned fear. These mutant mice are based on fear memory-related genes, stathmin and gastrin-releasing peptide receptor (GRPR). Remarkably, both mutant lines showed changes in fear extinction to the cue but not to the context. We performed indirect imaging of neuronal activity on the second day of cued extinction, using immediate-early gene c-Fos. GRPR knockout mice extinguished slower (impaired extinction) than wildtype mice, which was accompanied by an increase in c-Fos activity in the basolateral amygdala and a decrease in the prefrontal cortex. By contrast, stathmin knockout mice extinguished faster (enhanced extinction) and showed a decrease in c-Fos activity in the basolateral amygdala and an increase in the prefrontal cortex. At the same time, c-Fos activity in the dentate gyrus was increased in both mutant lines. These experiments provide genetic evidence that the balance between neuronal activities of the amygdala and prefrontal cortex defines an impairment or facilitation of extinction to the cue while the hippocampus is involved in the context-specificity of extinction."
https://openalex.org/W1973002597,"The Escherichia coli twin-arginine translocation (Tat) system transports fully folded and assembled proteins across the inner membrane into the periplasmic space. Traditionally, in vitro protein translocation studies have been performed using gel-based transport assays. This technique suffers from low time resolution, and often, an inability to distinguish between different steps in a continuously occurring translocation process. To address these limitations, we have developed an in vitro FRET-based assay that reports on an early step in the Tat translocation process in real-time. The natural Tat substrate pre-SufI was labeled with Alexa532 (donor), and the fluorescent protein mCherry (acceptor) was fused to the C terminus of TatB or TatC. The colored Tat proteins were easily visible during purification, enabling identification of a highly active inverted membrane vesicle (IMV) fraction yielding transport rates with NADH almost an order of magnitude faster than previously reported. When pre-SufI was bound to the translocon, FRET was observed for both Tat proteins. FRET was diminished upon addition of nonfluorescent pre-SufI, indicating that the initial binding step is reversible. When the membranes were energized with NADH, the FRET signal was lost after a short delay. These data suggest a model in which a Tat cargo initially associates with the TatBC complex, and an electric field gradient is required for the cargo to proceed to the next stage of transport. This cargo migration away from the TatBC complex requires a significant fraction of the total transport time."
https://openalex.org/W1996177945,"Rapidly activating and inactivating somatodendritic voltage-gated K(+) (Kv) currents, I(A), play critical roles in the regulation of neuronal excitability. Considerable evidence suggests that native neuronal I(A) channels function in macromolecular protein complexes comprising pore-forming (α) subunits of the Kv4 subfamily together with cytosolic, K(+) channel interacting proteins (KChIPs) and transmembrane, dipeptidyl peptidase 6 and 10 (DPP6/10) accessory subunits, as well as other accessory and regulatory proteins. Several recent studies have demonstrated a critical role for the KChIP subunits in the generation of native Kv4.2-encoded channels and that Kv4.2-KChIP complex formation results in mutual (Kv4.2-KChIP) protein stabilization. The results of the experiments here, however, demonstrate that expression of DPP6 in the mouse cortex is unaffected by the targeted deletion of Kv4.2 and/or Kv4.3. Further experiments revealed that heterologously expressed DPP6 and DPP10 localize to the cell surface in the absence of Kv4.2, and that co-expression with Kv4.2 does not affect total or cell surface DPP6 or DPP10 protein levels. In the presence of DPP6 or DPP10, however, cell surface Kv4.2 protein expression is selectively increased. Further addition of KChIP3 in the presence of DPP10 markedly increases total and cell surface Kv4.2 protein levels, compared with cells expressing only Kv4.2 and DPP10. Taken together, the results presented here demonstrate that the expression and localization of the DPP accessory subunits are independent of Kv4 α subunits and further that the DPP6/10 and KChIP accessory subunits independently stabilize the surface expression of Kv4.2."
https://openalex.org/W2048057867,"Nine human neurodegenerative diseases, including Huntington's disease and several spinocerebellar ataxia, are associated to the aggregation of proteins comprising an extended tract of consecutive glutamine residues (polyQs) once it exceeds a certain length threshold. This event is believed to be the consequence of the expansion of polyCAG codons during the replication process. This is in apparent contradiction with the fact that many polyQs-containing proteins remain soluble and are encoded by invariant genes in a number of eukaryotes. The latter suggests that polyQs expansion and/or aggregation might be counter-selected through a genetic and/or protein context. To identify this context, we designed a software that scrutinize entire proteomes in search for imperfect polyQs. The nature of residues flanking the polyQs and that of residues other than Gln within polyQs (insertions) were assessed. We discovered strong amino acid residue biases robustly associated to polyQs in the 15 eukaryotic proteomes we examined, with an over-representation of Pro, Leu and His and an under-representation of Asp, Cys and Gly amino acid residues. These biases are conserved amongst unrelated proteins and are independent of specific functional classes. Our findings suggest that specific residues have been co-selected with polyQs during evolution. We discuss the possible selective pressures responsible of the observed biases."

We present here evidence that a dog may respond to verbal requests composed of two independent terms, one referring to an object and the other to an action to be performed relative to the object. A female mongrel dog, Sofia, was initially trained to respond to action (point and fetch) and object (ball, key, stick, bottle and bear) terms which were then presented as simultaneous, combinatorial requests (e.g. ball fetch, stick point). Sofia successfully responded to object-action requests presented as single sentences, and was able to flexibly generalize her performance across different contexts. These results provide empirical evidence that dogs are able to extract the information contained in complex messages and to integrate it in directed performance, an ability which is shared with other linguistically trained animals and may represent a forerunner of syntactic functioning."

In humans, no study had systematically assessed seasonal patterns in CSF MA turnover in a large set of healthy adults.Standardized amounts of CSF were prospectively collected from 223 healthy individuals undergoing spinal anesthesia for minor surgical procedures. The metabolites of serotonin (5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid, 5-HIAA), dopamine (homovanillic acid, HVA) and norepinephrine (3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenylglycol, MPHG) were measured using high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Concentration measurements by sampling and birth dates were modeled using a non-linear quantile cosine function and locally weighted scatterplot smoothing (LOESS, span = 0.75). The cosine model showed a unimodal season of sampling 5-HIAA zenith in April and a nadir in October (p-value of the amplitude of the cosine = 0.00050), with predicted maximum (PC(max)) and minimum (PC(min)) concentrations of 173 and 108 nmol/L, respectively, implying a 60% increase from trough to peak. Season of birth showed a unimodal 5-HIAA zenith in May and a nadir in November (p = 0.00339; PC(max) = 172 and PC(min) = 126). The non-parametric LOESS showed a similar pattern to the cosine in both season of sampling and season of birth models, validating the cosine model. A final model including both sampling and birth months demonstrated that both sampling and birth seasons were independent predictors of 5-HIAA concentrations.In subjects without mental illness, 5-HT turnover shows circannual variation by season of sampling as well as season of birth, with peaks in spring and troughs in fall."
https://openalex.org/W2010941714,"DNA-binding proteins such as transcription factors use DNA-binding domains (DBDs) to bind to specific sequences in the genome to initiate many important biological functions. Accurate prediction of such target sequences, often represented by position weight matrices (PWMs), is an important step to understand many biological processes. Recent studies have shown that knowledge-based potential functions can be applied on protein-DNA co-crystallized structures to generate PWMs that are considerably consistent with experimental data. However, this success has not been extended to DNA-binding proteins lacking co-crystallized structures. This study aims at investigating the possibility of predicting the DNA sequences bound by DNA-binding proteins from the proteins' unbound structures (structures of the unbound state). Given an unbound query protein and a template complex, the proposed method first employs structure alignment to generate synthetic protein-DNA complexes for the query protein. Once a complex is available, an atomic-level knowledge-based potential function is employed to predict PWMs characterizing the sequences to which the query protein can bind. The evaluation of the proposed method is based on seven DNA-binding proteins, which have structures of both DNA-bound and unbound forms for prediction as well as annotated PWMs for validation. Since this work is the first attempt to predict target sequences of DNA-binding proteins from their unbound structures, three types of structural variations that presumably influence the prediction accuracy were examined and discussed. Based on the analyses conducted in this study, the conformational change of proteins upon binding DNA was shown to be the key factor. This study sheds light on the challenge of predicting the target DNA sequences of a protein lacking co-crystallized structures, which encourages more efforts on the structure alignment-based approaches in addition to docking- and homology modeling-based approaches for generating synthetic complexes."
https://openalex.org/W1987314790,"4-Nitrophenylphosphatase domain and non-neuronal SNAP25-like protein homolog 1 (NIPSNAP1) is a molecule of physiologically unknown function, although it is predominantly expressed in the brain, spinal cord, liver, and kidney. We identified NIPSNAP1 as a protein that interacts with the neuropeptide nocistatin (NST) from synaptosomal membranes of mouse spinal cord using high-performance affinity latex beads. NST, which is produced from the same precursor protein as an opioid-like neuropeptide nociceptin/orphanin FQ (N/OFQ), has opposite effects on pain transmission evoked by N/OFQ. The calculated full-length pre-protein of NIPSNAP1 was 33 kDa, whereas the N-terminal truncated form of NIPSNAP1 (29 kDa) was ubiquitously expressed in the neuronal tissues, especially in synaptic membrane and mitochondria of brain. The 29-kDa NIPSNAP1 was distributed on the cell surface, and NST interacted with the 29-kDa but not the 33-kDa NIPSNAP1. Although intrathecal injection of N/OFQ induced tactile allodynia in both wild-type and NIPSNAP1-deficient mice, the inhibition of N/OFQ-evoked tactile allodynia by NST seen in wild-type mice was completely lacking in the deficient mice. These results suggest that NIPSNAP1 is an interacting molecule of NST and plays a crucial role in pain transmission."
https://openalex.org/W2054064430,"N(α)-acetylation is a common protein modification catalyzed by different N-terminal acetyltransferases (NATs). Their essential role in the biogenesis and degradation of proteins is becoming increasingly evident. The NAT hNaa50p preferentially modifies peptides starting with methionine followed by a hydrophobic amino acid. hNaa50p also possesses N(ε)-autoacetylation activity. So far, no eukaryotic NAT has been mechanistically investigated. In this study, we used NMR spectroscopy, bisubstrate kinetic assays, and product inhibition experiments to demonstrate that hNaa50p utilizes an ordered Bi Bi reaction of the Theorell-Chance type. The NMR results, both the substrate binding study and the dynamic data, further indicate that the binding of acetyl-CoA induces a conformational change that is required for the peptide to bind to the active site. In support of an ordered Bi Bi reaction mechanism, addition of peptide in the absence of acetyl-CoA did not alter the structure of the protein. This model is further strengthened by the NMR results using a catalytically inactive hNaa50p mutant."
https://openalex.org/W2058856541,"ATP-sensitive potassium (K(ATP)) channels composed of sulfonylurea receptor 1 (SUR1) and Kir6.2 regulate insulin secretion by linking glucose metabolism with membrane potential. The number of K(ATP) channels in the plasma membrane affects the sensitivity of β-cells to glucose. Aberrant surface channel expression leads to insulin secretion disease. Previously, we have shown that K(ATP) channel proteins undergo endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-associated degradation (ERAD) via the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway, and inhibition of proteasome function results in an increase in channel surface expression. Here, we investigated whether Derlin-1, a protein involved in retrotranslocation of misfolded or misassembled proteins across the ER membrane for degradation by cytosolic proteasomes, plays a role in ERAD and, in turn, biogenesis efficiency of K(ATP) channels. We show that both SUR1 and Kir6.2 form a complex with Derlin-1 and an associated AAA-ATPase, p97. Overexpression of Derlin-1 led to a decrease in the biogenesis efficiency and surface expression of K(ATP) channels. Conversely, knockdown of Derlin-1 by RNA interference resulted in increased processing of SUR1 and a corresponding increase in surface expression of K(ATP) channels. Importantly, knockdown of Derlin-1 increased the abundance of disease-causing misfolded SUR1 or Kir6.2 proteins and even partially rescued surface expression in a mutant channel. We conclude that Derlin-1, by being involved in ERAD of SUR1 and Kir6.2, has a role in modulating the biogenesis efficiency and surface expression of K(ATP) channels. The results suggest that physiological or pathological changes in Derlin-1 expression levels may affect glucose-stimulated insulin secretion by altering surface expression of K(ATP) channels."
https://openalex.org/W2066247499,"Exocytosis is one of the most fundamental cellular events. The basic mechanism of the final step, membrane fusion, is mediated by the formation of the SNARE complex, which is modulated by the phosphorylation of proteins controlled by the concerted actions of protein kinases and phosphatases. We have previously shown that a protein phosphatase-1 (PP1) anchoring protein, phospholipase C-related but catalytically inactive protein (PRIP), has an inhibitory role in regulated exocytosis. The current study investigated the involvement of PRIP in the phospho-dependent modulation of exocytosis. Dephosphorylation of synaptosome-associated protein of 25 kDa (SNAP-25) was mainly catalyzed by PP1, and the process was modulated by wild-type PRIP but not by the mutant (F97A) lacking PP1 binding ability in in vitro studies. We then examined the role of PRIP in phospho-dependent regulation of exocytosis in cell-based studies using pheochromocytoma cell line PC12 cells, which secrete noradrenalin. Exogenous expression of PRIP accelerated the dephosphorylation process of phosphorylated SNAP-25 after forskolin or phorbol ester treatment of the cells. The phospho-states of SNAP-25 were correlated with noradrenalin secretion, which was enhanced by forskolin or phorbol ester treatment and modulated by PRIP expression in PC12 cells. Both SNAP-25 and PP1 were co-precipitated in anti-PRIP immunocomplex isolated from PC12 cells expressing PRIP. Collectively, together with our previous observation regarding the roles of PRIP in PP1 regulation, these results suggest that PRIP is involved in the regulation of the phospho-states of SNAP-25 by modulating the activity of PP1, thus regulating exocytosis."
https://openalex.org/W2010733666,"Background The aim of this study was to investigate whether insomnia and obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) were predictors of hospitalizations or emergency department visits during two years following the Sao Paulo Epidemiologic Sleep Study (EPISONO) sample. Methods and Findings All participants (n = 1,101) who underwent a baseline evaluation between July and December 2007 were contacted in December 2009 and asked to fill out a questionnaire about body weight changes, number of hospitalizations and visits to the emergency department. Participants lost during the follow-up period represented 3.2% (n = 35) and 7 subjects had died. Hospitalizations were reported by 116 volunteers (10.5%) and emergency department visits were reported by 136 participants (12.4%). The average body mass index (BMI) did not vary significantly between the first and the second assessment [26.7(95%CI:26.3–27.1) vs. 26.9(26.5–27.4) kg/m2]. After adjusting for confounders, a multiple logistic regression model revealed that female gender [1.4(1.0–1.9)], age ≥40 years, insomnia diagnosed according to the DSM-IV criteria [1.6(1.0–2.6)], and apnea-hypopnea index ≥15 [1.5(1.0–2.2)] were predictors of hospitalizations and/or demand for emergency services. Conclusion Our study of a probabilistic sample of the Sao Paulo inhabitants shows that over a period of two years, insomnia and OSA were both associated with health impairment. Considering the high prevalence and public health burden of sleep disorders, the consequences of untreated disease for both the individual and society are undeniable and should be addressed."
https://openalex.org/W2053356254,"Although selenium is an essential element, its excessive uptake is detrimental to living organisms. The significance of selenium for living organisms has been exploited for various purposes. However, the molecular basis of selenium toxicity is not completely understood. Here, we applied a capillary electrophoresis time-of-flight mass spectrometry-based metabolomics approach to analysis of yeast cells treated with selenomethionine. The data indicated that intracellular thiol compounds are significantly decreased, and diselenide and selenosulfide compounds are increased in selenomethionine-treated cells. The growth defect induced by selenomethionine was recovered by extracellular addition of cysteine and by genetic modification of yeast cells that have an additional de novo synthetic pathway for cysteine. Because cysteine is an intermediate of thiol compounds, these results suggested that the loss of a reduced form of thiol compounds due to selenomethionine causes a growth defect of yeast cells."
https://openalex.org/W2151287651,"Lipid bilayers and biological membranes are freely permeable to CO(2), and yet partial CO(2) pressure in the urine is 3-4-fold higher than in blood. We hypothesized that the responsible permeability barrier to CO(2) resides in the umbrella cell apical membrane of the bladder with its dense array of uroplakin complexes. We found that disrupting the uroplakin layer of the urothelium resulted in water and urea permeabilities (P) that were 7- to 8-fold higher than in wild type mice with intact urothelium. However, these interventions had no impact on bladder P(CO2) (∼1.6 × 10(-4) cm/s). To test whether the observed permeability barrier to CO(2) was due to an unstirred layer effect or due to kinetics of CO(2) hydration, we first measured the carbonic anhydrase (CA) activity of the bladder epithelium. Finding none, we reduced the experimental system to an epithelial monolayer, Madin-Darby canine kidney cells. With CA present inside and outside the cells, we showed that P(CO2) was unstirred layer limited (∼7 × 10(-3) cm/s). However, in the total absence of CA activity P(CO2) decreased 14-fold (∼ 5.1 × 10(-4) cm/s), indicating that now CO(2) transport is limited by the kinetics of CO(2) hydration. Expression of aquaporin-1 did not alter P(CO2) (and thus the limiting transport step), which confirmed the conclusion that in the urinary bladder, low P(CO2) is due to the lack of CA. The observed dependence of P(CO2) on CA activity suggests that the tightness of biological membranes to CO(2) may uniquely be regulated via CA expression."
https://openalex.org/W2091508984,"RhoA is reportedly involved in signal transducers and activators of transcription (STAT)-dependent transcription. However, the pathway connecting the GTPase and STAT signaling has not been characterized. Here, we made use of bacterial toxins, which directly activate Rho GTPases to analyze this pathway. Cytotoxic necrotizing factors (CNFs) are produced by pathogenic Escherichia coli strains and by Yersinia pseudotuberculosis. They activate small GTPases of the Rho family by deamidation of a glutamine, which is crucial for GTP hydrolysis. We show that RhoA activation leads to phosphorylation and activation of STAT3 and identify signal proteins involved in this pathway. RhoA-dependent STAT3 stimulation requires ROCK and Jun kinase activation as well as AP1-induced protein synthesis. The secretion of one or more factors activates the JAK-STAT pathway in an auto/paracrine manner. We identify CCL1/I-309 as an essential cytokine, which is produced and secreted upon RhoA activation and which is able to activate STAT3-dependent signaling pathways."
https://openalex.org/W2049355625,"CD4 T-cell decay is variable among HIV-infected individuals. In exceptional cases, CD4 T-cell counts remain stable despite high plasma viremia. HIV envelope glycoprotein (Env) properties, namely tropism, fusion or the ability to induce the NK ligand NKp44L, or host factors that modulate Env cytopathic mechanisms may be modified in such situation.We identified untreated HIV-infected individuals showing non-cytopathic replication (VL>10,000 copies/mL and CD4 T-cell decay<50 cells/µL/year, Viremic Non Progressors, VNP) or rapid progression (CD4 T-cells<350 cells/µL within three years post-infection, RP). We isolated full-length Env clones and analyzed their functions (tropism, fusion activity and capacity to induce NKp44L expression on CD4 cells). Anti-Env humoral responses were also analyzed.Env clones isolated from VNP or RP individuals showed no major phenotypic differences. The percentage of functional clones was similar in both groups. All clones tested were CCR5-tropic and showed comparable expression and fusogenic activity. Moreover, no differences were observed in their capacity to induce NKp44L expression on CD4 T cells from healthy donors through the 3S epitope of gp41. In contrast, anti- Env antibodies showed clear functional differences: plasma from VNPs had significantly higher capacity than RPs to block NKp44L induction by autologous viruses. Consistently, CD4 T-cells isolated from VNPs showed undetectable NKp44L expression and specific antibodies against a variable region flanking the highly conserved 3S epitope were identified in plasma samples from these patients. Conversely, despite continuous antigen stimulation, VNPs were unable to mount a broad neutralizing response against HIV.Env functions (fusion and induction of NKp44L) were similar in viremic patients with slow or rapid progression to AIDS. However, differences in humoral responses against gp41 epitopes nearby 3S sequence may contribute to the lack of CD4 T cell decay in VNPs by blocking the induction of NKp44L by gp41."
https://openalex.org/W2151803179,"While most transcriptome analyses in high-throughput clinical studies focus on gene level expression, the existence of alternative isoforms of gene transcripts is a major source of the diversity in the biological functionalities of the human genome. It is, therefore, essential to annotate isoforms of gene transcripts for genome-wide transcriptome studies. Recently developed mRNA sequencing technology presents an unprecedented opportunity to discover new forms of transcripts, and at the same time brings bioinformatic challenges due to its short read length and incomplete coverage for the transcripts. In this work, we proposed a computational approach to reconstruct new mRNA transcripts from short sequencing reads with reference information of known transcripts in existing databases. The prior knowledge helped to define exon boundaries and fill in the transcript regions not covered by sequencing data. This approach was demonstrated using a deep sequencing data set of human muscle tissue with transcript annotations in RefSeq as prior knowledge. We identified 2,973 junctions, 7,471 exons, and 7,571 transcripts not previously annotated in RefSeq. 73% of these new transcripts found supports from UCSC Known Genes, Ensembl or EST transcript annotations. In addition, the reconstructed transcripts were much longer than those from de novo approaches that assume no prior knowledge. These previously un-annotated transcripts can be integrated with known transcript annotations to improve both the design of microarrays and the follow-up analyses of isoform expression. The overall results demonstrated that incorporating transcript annotations from genomic databases significantly helps the reconstruction of novel transcripts from short sequencing reads for transcriptome research."
https://openalex.org/W2125585294,"Family based association study (FBAS) has the advantages of controlling for population stratification and testing for linkage and association simultaneously. We propose a retrospective multilevel model (rMLM) approach to analyze sibship data by using genotypic information as the dependent variable. Simulated data sets were generated using the simulation of linkage and association (SIMLA) program. We compared rMLM to sib transmission/disequilibrium test (S-TDT), sibling disequilibrium test (SDT), conditional logistic regression (CLR) and generalized estimation equations (GEE) on the measures of power, type I error, estimation bias and standard error. The results indicated that rMLM was a valid test of association in the presence of linkage using sibship data. The advantages of rMLM became more evident when the data contained concordant sibships. Compared to GEE, rMLM had less underestimated odds ratio (OR). Our results support the application of rMLM to detect gene-disease associations using sibship data. However, the risk of increasing type I error rate should be cautioned when there is association without linkage between the disease locus and the genotyped marker."
