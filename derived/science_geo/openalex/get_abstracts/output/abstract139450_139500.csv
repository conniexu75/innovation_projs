https://openalex.org/W2027042060,"During beneficial inflammation, potentially tissue-damaging granulocytes undergo apoptosis before being cleared by phagocytes in a non-phlogistic manner. Here we show that the rate of constitutive apoptosis in human neutrophils and eosinophils is greatly accelerated in both a rapid and concentration-dependent manner by the fungal metabolite gliotoxin, but not by its inactive analog methylthiogliotoxin. This induction of apoptosis was abolished by the caspase inhibitor zVAD-fmk, correlated with the inhibition of nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB), and was mimicked by a cell permeable inhibitory peptide of NF-κB, SN-50; other NF-κB inhibitors, curcumin and pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate; and the proteasome inhibitor, MG-132. Gliotoxin also augmented dramatically the early (2–6 h) pro-apoptotic effects of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) in neutrophils and unmasked the ability of TNF-α to induce eosinophil apoptosis. In neutrophils, TNF-α caused a gliotoxin-inhibitable activation of an inducible form of NF-κB, a response that may underlie the ability of TNF-α to delay apoptosis at later times (12–24 h) and limit its early killing effect. Furthermore, cycloheximide displayed a similar capacity to enhance TNF-α induced neutrophil apoptosis even at time points when cycloheximide alone had no pro-apoptotic effect, suggesting that NF-κB may regulate the production of protein(s) which protect neutrophils from the cytotoxic effects of TNF-α. These data shed light on the biochemical and molecular mechanisms regulating human granulocyte apoptosis and, in particular, indicate that the transcription factor NF-κB plays a crucial role in regulating the physiological cell death pathway in granulocytes.

These data shed light on the biochemical and molecular mechanisms regulating human granulocyte apoptosis and, in particular, indicate that the transcription factor NF-κB plays a crucial role in regulating the physiological cell death pathway in granulocytes. Neutrophilic and eosinophilic granulocytes originate from a common myeloid precursor; neutrophils are particularly active in the defense against invading micro-organisms whereas eosinophils serve in anti-parasitic defenses and play a role in allergic inflammation. The normally beneficial acute inflammatory response can become dysregulated and result in chronic inflammatory conditions where tissue damage arises in part due to the inappropriate liberation of inflammatory cell-derived histotoxic products. We have previously described a granulocyte clearance mechanism likely to be important in the normal control and resolution processes of inflammation whereby granulocytes must first undergo apoptosis (programmed cell death) before being phagocytosed and cleared by macrophages in situ (1Savill J.S.

Immunol. 1992; 148: 3543-3549PubMed Google Scholar). Apoptosis also causes functional down-regulation of granulocytes and the retention of proteolytic granule contents to further limit the potential for granulocyte-mediated tissue damage (3Whyte M.K.B. Meagher L.C. MacDermot J. Haslett C. J. Immunol. 1993; 150: 5124-5134PubMed Google Scholar, 4Stern M. Savill J.S. Haslett C. Am. J. Pathol. 1996; 149: 911-921PubMed Google Scholar). While little is known about the physiological mechanisms involved in controlling granulocyte apoptosis, many in vitro studies have now shown that an array of pro-inflammatory cytokines and inflammatory mediators known to be present at inflamed sites inhibit the process of apoptosis in granulocytes (2Stern M. Meagher L. Savill J. Haslett C. J. Immunol. 1992; 148: 3543-3549PubMed Google Scholar, 3Whyte M.K.B. Meagher L.C. MacDermot J. Haslett C. J.

This has led to the suggestion that such agents act both to attract and activate inflammatory cells and also delay their removal. A notable exception to this rule, however, is TNF-α, 1The abbreviations used are: TNF-α, tumor necrosis factor-α; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay; LPS, lipopolysaccharide; NF-κB, nuclear factor-κB; PDTC, pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate; zVAD-fmk, benzyloxycarbonyl-Val-Ala-Asp-fluoromethylketone: DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium.1The abbreviations used are: TNF-α, tumor necrosis factor-α; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay; LPS, lipopolysaccharide; NF-κB, nuclear factor-κB; PDTC, pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate; zVAD-fmk, benzyloxycarbonyl-Val-Ala-Asp-fluoromethylketone: DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. which, at early time points in neutrophil culture, causes acceleration of the constitutive rate of apoptosis (10Murray J. Barbara J.A.J. Dunkley S.A. Lopez A.F. Van Ostade X. Condliffe A.M. Dransfield I. Haslett C. Chilvers E.R. Blood. 1997; 90: 2772-2783Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Many inflammatory mediators regulate gene expression in target cells by influencing the activities of transcription factors such as nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB). NF-κB is composed of homo- or heterodimers of the Rel family proteins (p50/NFκB1, p52/NFκB2, p65/RelA, and cRel) which are sequestered in the cytoplasm by physical association with inhibitor proteins referred to as IκB (11Henkel T. Machleidt T. Alkalay I. Kronke M. Ben-Neriah Y. Baeuerle P.A. Nature. 1993; 365: 182-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (1035) Google Scholar). Upon activation, the IκB subunit is rapidly phosphorylated leading to its proteolytic breakdown permitting NF-κB to translocate to the nucleus (12Traenckner E.B. Wilk S. Baeuerle P.A. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5433-5441Crossref PubMed Scopus (654) Google Scholar, 13Finco T.S. Beg A.A. Baldwin Jr., A.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 11884-11888Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar) where it regulates the activity of many genes involved in the inflammatory response, including those for pro-inflammatory cytokines. In a number of cell systems TNF-α has been shown to induce rapid activation of NF-κB, a response known to mediate a number of TNF-α induced cellular responses (reviewed in Refs. 14Baeuerle P.A. Baichwal V.R. Adv. Immunol. 1994; 62: 1192-1198Google Scholar, 15May M.J. Ghosh S. Immunol. Today. 1998; 19: 80-88Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1048) Google Scholar, 16Baldwin Jr., A. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1996; 14: 649-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (5563) Google Scholar). However, whether the activation of NF-κB is involved in either the pro- or anti-apoptotic effects of TNF-α in granulocytes is currently unknown. Whereas the inhibition of NF-κB has been shown to induce apoptosis in murine B cells (17Wu M. Lee H. Bellas R.E. Schauer S.L. Arsura M. Katz D. FitzGerald M.J. Rothstein T.L. Sherr D.H. Sonenshein G.E. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4682-4690Crossref PubMed Scopus (555) Google Scholar), a completely opposite effect has been observed in other cell types where apoptosis is associated with activation of NF-κB (18Grimm S. Bauer M.K.A. Baeuerle P.A. Schulze-Osthoff K. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 13-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar). In addition, several groups have reported that inactivation of NF-κB increases the cytotoxic effects of TNF-α (19Beg A.A. Baltimore D. Science. 1996; 274: 782-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (2933) Google Scholar, 20Van Antwerp D.J. Martin S.J. Kafri T. Green D.R. Verma I.M. Science. 1996; 274: 787-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (2447) Google Scholar, 21Wang C. Mayo M.W. Baldwin A.S. Science. 1996; 274: 784-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (2509) Google Scholar). In granulocytes, it remains uncertain whether NF-κB can be activated by inflammatory mediators, or is indeed present, in human neutrophils. For example, while MacDonald et al., (22McDonald P.P. Bald A. Cassatella A.A. Blood. 1997; 89: 3421-3433Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) reported that lipopolysaccharide (LPS), TNF-α, and the chemotactic peptide N-formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine all cause a marked activation of NF-κB, Browning et al., (23Browning D.D. Pan Z.K. Prossnitz E.R. Ye R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7995-8001Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) found no such activity in these cells despite obvious NF-κB activation in peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Gliotoxin, a member of the epipolythiodioxoperazine family of compounds (24Braithwaite A.W. Eichner R.D. Waring P. Müllbacher A. Mol. Immunol. 1987; 24: 47-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), exhibits immunosuppressive activity both in vivo andin vitro. For example, gliotoxin has been shown to inhibit mitogen-induced proliferation of both T and B cells, induce macrophage and osteoclast apoptosis in vitro (25Ozaki K. Takeda H. Iwahashi H. Kitano S. Hanazawa S. FEBS Lett. 1997; 410: 297-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 26Waring P. Eichner R.D. Müllbacher A. Sjaarda A. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 18493-18499Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and cause thymocyte and spleen cell apoptosis in vivo (27Sutton P. Newcombe N.R. Waring P. Müllbacher A. Infect. Immunol. 1994; 62: 1192-1198Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, the biochemical and molecular mechanisms underlying these effects remain uncertain. Gliotoxin has, however, recently been shown to be a potent and specific inhibitor of NF-κB (28Pahl H.L. Krauß B. Schulze-Osthoff K. Decker T. Traenckner E.B. Vogt M. Myers C. Parks T. Warring P. Mühlbacher A. Czernilofsky A.-P. Baeuerle P.A. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 183: 1829-1840Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). We therefore used gliotoxin as a pharmacological tool to investigate the involvement of NF-κB in the regulation of granulocyte apoptosis. We demonstrate that gliotoxin causes a rapid and major induction of apoptosis in human peripheral blood granulocytes in vitro and up-regulates TNF-α-induced apoptosis in both neutrophils and eosinophils. In addition, we present evidence that these effects occur via a specific, non-toxic and caspase-controlled mechanism that is mediated by the ability of gliotoxin to inhibit an inducible form of NF-κB. The ability of other NF-κB inhibitors to cause a similar induction of apoptosis provides further evidence supporting the involvement of NF-κB in granulocyte apoptosis. Interestingly, the pro-apoptotic effect of TNF-α is enhanced by protein synthesis blockade suggesting that NF-κB activation results in the generation of an unidentified survival protein. These data therefore strongly suggest that NF-κB plays a key role in regulating both constitutive and TNF-α stimulated human granulocyte apoptosis. Neutrophils and eosinophils were isolated from the peripheral blood of normal donors by dextran sedimentation followed by centrifugation through discontinuous plasma-Percoll gradients (2Stern M. Meagher L. Savill J. Haslett C. J. Immunol. 1992; 148: 3543-3549PubMed Google Scholar, 29Haslett C. Guthrie L.A. Kopaniak M.M. Johnston Jr., R.B. Henson P.M. Am. J. Pathol. 1985; 119: 101-110PubMed Google Scholar). Only neutrophil preparations with a neutrophil purity of >98% were used. Eosinophils were separated from contaminating neutrophils using an immunomagnetic separation step with sheep anti-mouse IgG-Dynabeads (Dynabeads M-450, Dynal, Merseyside, United Kingdom) coated with the murine anti-neutrophil antibody 3G8 (anti-CD16; a gift from Dr. J. Unkeless, Mount Sinai Medical School, New York). Cells were mixed with washed 3G8-coated Dynabeads at a bead:neutrophil ratio of 3:1 on a rotary mixer at 4 °C for 20 min, and the beads removed magnetically by two 3-min stationary magnetic contacts (Dynal Magnetic Particle Concentrator, MPC-1) to yield an a eosinophil population of >98% purity. After purification, cells were washed twice in phosphate-buffered saline without calcium and magnesium and once in phosphate-buffered saline before resuspending in Iscove's DMEM (Life Technologies, Paisley, UK) with 10% autologous serum. Both cell types were cultured in flat-bottomed Falcon flexible wells (Becton Dickinson, Oxford, UK) at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere; neutrophils at a concentration of 5 × 106/ml and eosinophils at 2 × 106/ml. Cells were cultured in the absence or presence of test agents as described in the figure legends. All experiments were performed at least 3 times and each treatment done in triplicate. Cells were cyto-centrifuged, fixed in methanol, stained with Diff-QuikTM, and counted using oil immersion microscopy (×100 objective) to determine the proportion of cells with highly distinctive apoptotic morphology (5Her E. Frazer J. Austen F. Owen Jr., W.F. J. Clin. Invest. 1991; 88: 1982-1987Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 7Lee A. Whyte M.K.B. Haslett C. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1993; 54: 283-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (671) Google Scholar, 10Murray J. Barbara J.A.J. Dunkley S.A. Lopez A.F. Van Ostade X. Condliffe A.M. Dransfield I. Haslett C. Chilvers E.R. Blood. 1997; 90: 2772-2783Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). At least 500 cells were counted per slide with the observer blinded to the experiment conditions. The results were expressed as the mean % apoptosis ± S.E. A separate and independent assessment of apoptosis was performed by flow cytometry using fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled recombinant human annexin V that binds to phosphatidylserine exposed on the surface of apoptotic cells. Stock annexin V (Bender MedSystems, Vienna, Austria) was diluted 1:200 with binding buffer and then added (25 μl) to 75 μl of the recovered cell samples. Following a 10-min incubation at 4 °C, these samples were fixed by the addition of 100 μl of 3% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline before analysis using an EPICS Profile II (Coulter Electronics, Luton, UK). DNA was extracted as described previously (10Murray J. Barbara J.A.J. Dunkley S.A. Lopez A.F. Van Ostade X. Condliffe A.M. Dransfield I. Haslett C. Chilvers E.R. Blood. 1997; 90: 2772-2783Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, 2 × 106 neutrophils were taken after the indicated treatment and lysed in 500 μl of lysis buffer (6 m guanidine hydrochloride, 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.0, and 0.1% N-lauroyl sarcosine) at 4 °C and the nucleic acids extracted by the addition of an equal volume of 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0-saturated phenol:chloroform mixture (50:50, v/v). The resulting emulsion was centrifuged at 12,000 ×g av for 10 min at room temperature and the aqueous phase removed and precipitated with 0.6 volumes of isopropyl alcohol at room temperature. The precipitated nucleic acids were then pelleted by centrifugation at 10,000 × g avfor 5 min and re-dissolved in 50 μl of TE buffer (10 mmTris-Cl, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0) containing 50 μg/ml RNase A. The fragmented DNA was separated by agarose gel electrophoresis on a 1.4% (w/v) agarose (Flowgen, UK) 0.5 × TBE (10 mmTrizma (Tris base), 10 mm boric acid, and 1 mmEDTA, pH 8.3) gel. The gel was run for 2 h at 75 V and stained using ethidium bromide (0.5 μg/ml). The UV transilluminated image was printed by digital thermal printing using a GS7600 gel documentation system (UVP Products, UK). Since apoptotic neutrophils and eosinophils maintain the integrity of their plasma membrane, assessment of granulocyte necrosis can be determined by the ability of cells to exclude the vital dye trypan blue and also by flow cytometry using propidium iodide staining. Samples (150 μl of cells at 2 × 106/ml) were centrifuged and resuspended in 150 μl of propidium iodide solution (33 μg/ml propidium iodide in phosphate-buffered saline containing 1.67 mg/ml RNase). The profiles of heat-treated (necrotic cells) from the same samples were used as controls. EMSAs were carried out as described by the manufacturer (Promega Corp, Southampton, UK). Nuclear extracts were prepared from 5 × 106 cells using a modification of the method of Dignamet al. (30Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9153) Google Scholar). Briefly, pelleted cells were resuspended in 200 μl of hypotonic buffer (buffer A: 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 1.5 mm EDTA, 10 mm KCl, 0.5 mmdithiothreitol, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, leupeptin, and pepstatin A, 1 μm 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 0.5 mm benzamidine, and 2 mm levamisole) and placed on ice for 10 min. Following the addition of 0.1 volumes of 10% Nonidet P-40 (W/v) the cells were vortexed briefly and centrifuged at 12,000 ×g av for 2 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was discarded and the pellet washed in 100 μl of buffer A minus Nonidet P-40 and re-centrifuged. The pelleted nuclei were then resuspended in 50 μl of hypertonic buffer (buffer B: 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm KCl, 1.5 mmEDTA, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, leupeptin, and pepstatin A, 1 μm 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 0.5 mmbenzamidine, and 2 mm levamisole) and stored at −80 °C until use. Nuclear extracts (approximately 2 μg of protein, 7 × 105 cell equivalent, in 7 μl) were incubated in binding buffer (4% glycerol, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 50 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, with 50 μg/ml poly(dI-dC)·poly(dI-dC) (Pharmacia Biotech, UK) with 17 fmol of γ-32P-labeled double stranded oligonucleotide containing the decameric κB-binding site (3000 Ci/mmol; Promega Corp., Southampton, UK) at 22 °C for 20 min prior to addition of 5 μl of loading buffer (0.01% (w/v) bromphenol blue, 20% (w/v) Ficoll 400™, and 1 mm EDTA). Samples were loaded onto an 8% (w/v) native acrylamide gel (Protean IIxi, Bio-Rad, Hemel Hempstead, UK) in 0.5 × TBE buffer and run at 250 V for 2 h. The gel was then dried onto 3MM paper (Whatman UK, Maidstone, UK) and BioMax MS-1 x-ray film (Kodak, Anachem, Luton, UK) was exposed to the gel. Processed films were analyzed using the GrabIt and GelPlate software (UVP, Orme Technologies, UK) and the data expressed as a percent of the control value for each experiment. Further specific materials were obtained as follows: curcumin, gliotoxin, LPS (Escherichia coli 0127:B8), methylthiogliotoxin, and PDTC (Sigma Co., Poole, UK); recombinant human TNF-α (R & D Systems, Abingdon, Oxon, UK); zVAD-fmk (Bachem (UK) Ltd., Saffron Walden, UK). The proteasome inhibitor MG-132 (N-cbz-Leu-Leu-leucinal), and the NF-κB inhibitory peptides SN50 and SN50M (Biomol, Affinity Research Products, Mamhead, UK). All other reagents were obtained from Sigma, UK, and were of the highest purity. The results are expressed as mean ± S.E. of the number (n) of independent experiments each using cells from separate donors with each treatment performed in triplicate. Statistical analysis was performed by ANOVA with comparisons between groups made using the Newman-Kuels procedure. Differences were considered significant when p < 0.05. As shown in Fig.1 gliotoxin caused a rapid and profound induction of neutrophil apoptosis in vitro which was both concentration (e.g. at 6 h EC50 = 76.1 ± 22.1 ng/ml, Fig. 1 A), and time-dependent (Fig. 1, A and B). Hence using a maximally effective gliotoxin concentration of 1 μg/ml, apoptosis was readily apparent within 2 h and reached 100% by 6 h. At 20 h, when the rate of constitutive neutrophil apoptosis was 58.7 ± 2.9%, gliotoxin caused 100% apoptosis at all concentrations greater than 0.1 μg/ml. The inactive analogue of gliotoxin, methylthiogliotoxin, did not affect the constitutive rate of neutrophil apoptosis at any of the time points studied (Fig. 1 B). Neither gliotoxin nor its inactive analogue, methylthiogliotoxin, caused cell necrosis since less than 1% of the cells were permeable to the vital dye trypan blue. In contrast to many other hematopoetic cells, human neutrophils appear highly resistant to the induction of apoptosis induced by certain agents, for example, incubation with Ca2+ ionophores (31Whyte M.K.

Leukocyte Biol. 1993; 54: 283-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (671) Google Scholar) causes inhibition of apoptosis as does hypoxia (34Hannah S. Mecklenburgh K. Rahman I. Bellingan G.J. Greening A. Haslett C. Chilvers E.R. FEBS Lett. 1995; 372: 233-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Furthermore, while TNF-α and Fas-L can induce neutrophil apoptosis, this effect is modest and transient, and in the case of TNF-α abolished if the cells are initially primed with platelet-activating factor or LPS (10Murray J. Barbara J.A.J. Dunkley S.A. Lopez A.F. Van Ostade X. Condliffe A.M. Dransfield I. Haslett C. Chilvers E.R. Blood. 1997; 90: 2772-2783Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 35Hachiya O. Takeda Y. Miyata H. Watanabe H. Yamashita T. Sendo F. Microbiol. Immunol. 1995; 39: 715-723Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). We therefore sought to determine the effect of gliotoxin on TNF-α-induced apoptosis in neutrophils. These experiments were performed deliberately at a very early time point (2 h) when the independent pro-apoptotic effects of even a maximally effective concentration of TNF-α (10 ng/ml) (10Murray J. Barbara J.A.J. Dunkley S.A. Lopez A.F. Van Ostade X. Condliffe A.M. Dransfield I. Haslett C. Chilvers E.R. Blood. 1997; 90: 2772-2783Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and gliotoxin (1 μg/ml; Fig. 1 A) are only just apparent. As shown in Fig. 2 A, a major synergy was observed between these agents for the induction of apoptosis which was apparent even at gliotoxin concentrations as low as 3 ng/ml. Hence, a concentration of 0.1 μg/ml gliotoxin in combination with TNF-α (10 ng/ml) caused almost 100% apoptosis at 2 h. With gliotoxin alone, only 6% apoptosis was noted at 2 h, with just over 65% at 6 h (Fig. 1 A). Again, methylthiogliotoxin had no effect on constitutive apoptosis or TNF-α-induced apoptosis at 2 h (Fig. 2 B). The level of necrosis in cells from each treatment was assessed by trypan blue exclusion; all values were <1% (data not shown). The genuine nature of both the intrinsic pro-apoptotic effect of gliotoxin and the dramatic synergy with TNF-α was assessed by comparing the quantitative morphological effects of these agents with their effects on annexin V binding and DNA fragmentation. The changes from normal cell morphology to apoptotic morphology are clearly seen in Fig. 3 A; where non-apoptotic neutrophils contain a multilobed nucleus and the apoptotic cells have a shrunken appearance with pyknotic nuclei. These data can be compared with Fig. 3 B, where the annexin V “low peak” represents non-apoptotic cells and the annexin V “high peak” represents apoptotic cells since the fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled annexin V binds in the presence of Ca2+ to phosphatidylserine exposed on the outer membrane of apoptotic cells. Although control cells at 2 h exhibit low rates of apoptosis, the small increase in annexin V positive cells observed with TNF-α and gliotoxin alone is again dramatically augmented when the cells are cultured in the presence of both reagents together. Analysis by DNA fragmentation also demonstrates that cells cultured alone or in combination with the above reagents exhibit the classical “ladder” of DNA fragmentation associated with apoptosis (Fig. 3 C).Figure 3The effect of gliotoxin and TNF-α on neutrophil morphology, phosphatidylserine expression, and cell membrane integrity. A, cytocentrifuge preparations of human neutrophils incubated for 2 h in Iscove's DMEM at 37 °C containing 10% autologous serum alone (control), plus TNF-α, plus gliotoxin, or with both TNF-α and gliotoxin at the concentrations shown. Neutrophils treated with both reagents all clearly show apoptotic morphology. B, after 2 h in culture at 37 °C, cells treated with Iscove's DMEM, TNF-α (10 ng/ml), gliotoxin (0.1 μg/ml), or with both TNF-α plus gliotoxin were resuspended and incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled recombinant human annexin V to determine phosphatidylserine expression. The cells were then fixed and analyzed using an EPICS Profile II. Mean fluorescence values are shown for a minimum of 5,000 cells for each condition. C, DNA fragmentation in human neutrophils treated with TNF-α (10 ng/ml), gliotoxin (0.1 μg/ml), or both reagents together for 2 h. DNA was prepared as detailed under “Experimental Procedures”; lane 1, DNA marker (1-kilobase ladder); lane 2, freshly isolated neutrophils;lane 3, control; lane 4, TNF-α; lane 5, gliotoxin, 2 h; lane 6, co-culture with gliotoxin and TNF-α; lane 7, DNA marker (1-kilobase ladder). D, to assess cell membrane integrity, cells treated with both TNF-α (10 ng/ml) and gliotoxin (0.1 μg/ml) for 4 h, which induced 100% apoptosis even by 2 h, were resuspended and incubated with propidium iodide, fixed, and analyzed using an EPICS Profile II (solid line). An aliquot of cells from this preparation was heated as indicated under “Experimental Procedures” to produce 100% necrosis (dotted line). Mean fluorescence values are shown for a minimum of 5,000 cells for each condition.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Although our initial studies using trypan blue as a marker of plasma membrane integrity indicated that gliotoxin, both in the presence and absence of TNF-α, induced a purely apoptotic form of cell death, we felt it was important to validate this further by assessing necrosis in an independent manner using propidium iodide staining detected by flow cytometry. Fig. 3 D shows the profile of neutrophils 4 h following treatment with gliotoxin (0.1 μg/ml) and TNF-α (10 ng/ml) where, despite apoptotic rates of 100%, almost all cells showed low fluorescence indicating that the cell membrane had remained intact. As a positive control, cells cultured initially with TNF-α and gliotoxin were then heat-treated (60 °C, 5 min) to ensure 100% necrosis. This resulted in a uniform and major increase in propidium iodide staining (Fig. 3 D). These data coincide completely with the results obtained with trypan blue staining and confirm that these cells had undergone apoptotic cell death and were not necrotic. To investigate whether gliotoxin could modulate the effects of LPS on the rate of neutrophil apoptosis we performed a series of experiments where neutrophils were cultured for 2, 3, 4, and 20 h in the presence of LPS, gliotoxin, and a combination of LPS plus gliotoxin and apoptosis assessed morphologically (Fig. 4). As reported previously (7Lee A. Whyte M.K.B. Haslett C. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1993; 54: 283-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (671) Google Scholar) LPS caused an inhibition of neutrophil apoptosis at 20 h when compared with control cells. Interestingly, the suppressive effect of LPS was prevented by the strong pro-apoptotic effect of gliotoxin. In addition, unlike co-culture of gliotoxin plus TNF-α, no synergistic induction of apoptosis was observed when LPS was cultured in the presence of gliotoxin (Fig. 4). To explore whether the pro-apoptotic effect of gliotoxin was restricted to neutrophils, a similar set of experiments were performed using human peripheral blood eosinophils isolated from mildly atopic individuals. While these cells display a similar capacity to undergo constitutive apoptosis when aged in vitro, this process is much slower than that observed for the neutrophil and is differentially regulated being, for example, stimulated rather than inhibite"
https://openalex.org/W2018452760,"The differentiation of C2C12 myoblasts to myotubes was found to be accompanied by a strong activation of p70 S6 kinase and the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) family member SAPK2/p38, without significant activation of p42 MAPK and only slight activation of SAPK1/JNK and protein kinase Bα. Consistent with these findings, SB 203580 (a specific inhibitor of SAPK2/p38) or rapamycin (which blocks the activation of p70 S6 kinase) prevented the formation of multinucleated myotubes, as well as the expression of muscle-specific proteins that included SAPK3 (another MAPK family member). PD 098059 (which prevents the activation of p42 MAPK) had no effect on myotube formation. Surprisingly, the slow activation of p70 S6 kinase during differentiation was not only prevented by rapamycin but also by SB 203580, and the activation of MAPKAP kinase-2 (anin vivo substrate of SAPK2/p38) was not only prevented by SB 203580 but also by rapamycin. In contrast, the acute activation of p70 S6 kinase in C2C12 myoblasts induced by phorbol esters was unaffected by SB 203580 and the acute activation of MAPKAP kinase-2 induced by anisomycin was unaffected by rapamycin.

The differentiation of skeletal muscle starts when myoblasts withdraw from the cell division cycle and is characterized morphologically by the alignment, elongation, and fusion of mononucleated myoblasts into multinucleated myotubes. Myogenesis is largely controlled by the myogenic basic helix-loop-helix family of transcription factors (MyoD, myogenin, myf5, and MRF4), and the myocyte enhancer factor-2 (1Lassar A.B. Skapek S.X. Novitch B. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1994; 6: 788-794Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar, 2Olson E.N. Perry M. Schulz R.A. Dev. Biol. 1995; 172: 2-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar), which control the expression of many muscle-specific genes, such as the myosin heavy chain and creatine kinase. Cell division is prevented during muscle differentiation by the induction of cyclin-dependent protein kinase inhibitors (3Halevy O. Novitch B.G. Spicer D.B. Skapek S.X. Rhee J. Hannon G.J. Beach D. Lassar A.B. Science. 1995; 267: 1018-1021Crossref PubMed Scopus (1092) Google Scholar,4Franklin D.S. Xiong Y. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 1587-1599Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Skeletal muscle differentiation is negatively influenced either by treating myoblasts with serum or growth factors (e.g. basic fibroblast growth factor-2, transforming growth factor β1) or by oncogenes, such as c-myc, c-jun, c-fos, Ha-ras, and E1a (1Lassar A.B.

Some differentiation inhibitors activate the classical mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) 1The abbreviations used are: MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; MKP1, MAPK phosphatase-1; SAPK, stress-activated protein kinase; JNK, c-Jun N-terminal kinase; MBP, myelin basic protein, IGF-1, insulin-like growth factor-1; GST, glutathione S-transferase; PMA, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate; MAPKAP-K2, MAPK activated protein kinase-2; FCS, fetal calf serum; PKB, protein kinase B; PI 3-kinase, phosphatidylinositide 3-kinase. pathway, which has been implicated in regulating proliferation and differentiation in a variety of cells (7Hill C.S.

EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2491-2498Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). For this reason, the role of the MAPK pathway in regulating skeletal muscle differentiation has been studied extensively, but the results have been controversial. For example, the compound PD 098059 (which prevents the activation of MAPK by inhibiting the activation of MAPK kinase-1 (9Alessi D.R. Cuenda A. Cohen P. Dudley D.T. Saltiel A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27489-27494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3256) Google Scholar)) was reported to increase the rate of myotube formation in the presence of insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-I) in L6 (10Coolican S.A.

Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 1794-1800Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), suggesting a negative role for MAPK in this process. In contrast, another laboratory reported that MAPK plays a positive role in myogenesis (12Gredinger E. Gerber A.N. Tamir Y. Tapscott S.J. Bengal E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10436-10444Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). They reported that MAPK activity is induced concomitantly with muscle differentiation in either C2 myoblasts or muscle cells derived from MyoD-expressing 10T1/2 fibroblasts. They also reported that PD 098059 partially inhibited the fusion of myoblasts to multinucleated myotubes and the induction of MyoD expression that normally takes place during terminal differentiation, without affecting the expression of certain muscle-specific proteins. Another group reported that MAPK has a negative role at the early stages of myogenesis because myoblasts overexpressing MAPK phosphatase-1 (MKP1) showed enhanced production of muscle-specific genes. However, overexpression of MKP1 inhibited myotube formation at later times, and it was suggested that the MAPK pathway plays positive, as well as negative roles in muscle differentiation (13Bennett A.M. Tonks N.K. Science. 1997; 278: 1288-1291Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). Other investigators reported that PD 098059 did not affect differentiation of C2 myoblasts, implying that the MAPK pathway is not required for this process (14Pinset C. Garcia A. Rousse S. Dubois C. Montarras D. C. R. Acad. Sci. (Paris). 1997; 320: 367-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). They also reported that wortmannin, an inhibitor of phosphatidylinositide 3-kinase, inhibits the IGF-I-dependent differentiation of C2 myoblasts. MKP1 is not specific for MAPK but can also inactivate other MAPK family members in vitro, such as SAPK2a/p38α (15Rouse J. Cohen P. Trigon S. Morange M. Alonso-Llamazares A. Zamanillo D. Hunt T. Nebreda A.R. Cell. 1994; 78: 1027-1037Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1503) Google Scholar) and SAPK1/JNK (16Groom L.A. Sneddon A.A. Alessi D.R. Dowd S. Keyse S.M. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3621-3632Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). SAPK2a/p38α and SAPK1/JNK lie in distinct signal transduction pathways and, in many cells, become activated in response to cellular stresses (such as the protein synthesis inhibitor anisomycin), lipopolysaccharide, or proinflammatory cytokines (reviewed in Ref. 17Cohen P. Trends Cell Biol. 1997; 7: 353-361Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar). The effects of MKP1 on muscle differentiation (13Bennett A.M. Tonks N.K. Science. 1997; 278: 1288-1291Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar) could therefore be explained by the inhibition of other MAPK cascades. For this reason, we have investigated the potential role of SAPK2/p38 in skeletal muscle differentiation by studying the effect of SB 203580, a specific inhibitor of both SAPK2a/p38α and its close relative SAPK2b/p38β (collectively referred to as SAPK2/p38) (18Lee J.C.

We demonstrate that the SAPK2/p38 pathway is activated during C2C12 cell differentiation and that SB 203580 (but not PD 098059) blocks myotube formation and the expression of muscle-specific genes. Our results demonstrate for the first time that SAPK2/p38 is required for C2C12 myogenesis triggered by low concentrations of serum.

To analyze the effect of different inhibitors of signal transduction pathways on C2C12 differentiation, confluent cells were washed with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and differentiation medium was added without or with 10 μm SB 203580 (19Cuenda A.

All the inhibitors were dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO) to give concentrations of 1–50 mm, and 1 μl was added per 1 ml of culture medium. The equivalent volume of Me2SO was added to control cultures in every experiment. The medium was replaced with fresh medium (with or without inhibitors) every 24 h.

To assay SAPK1/JNK in C2C12 extracts, 10 μg of GST-c-Jun-(1–194) bound to GSH-agarose beads was incubated with cell lysate (150 μg) for 3 h at 4 °C to allow SAPK1/JNK to bind to its substrate GST-c-Jun-(1–194). The beads were washed, and SAPK1/JNK activity was assayed as described previously (30Meier R. Rouse J. Cuenda A. Nebreda A.R. Cohen P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 236: 796-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). One unit of protein kinase is that amount which catalyzes the phosphorylation of 1 nmol of peptide or protein substrate in 1 min. C2C12 myoblasts were grown to 80–90% confluency and then induced to differentiate by changing the medium from 20% FCS to 5% horse serum and left for up to 6 days. During this period, the activities were measured of five protein kinases that lie in distinct signal transduction pathways, namely MAPKAP-K2, p70 S6 kinase, p42 MAPK, SAPK1/JNK, and PKBα. We found that MAPKAP-K2, an in vivo substrate of SAPK2/p38 (15Rouse J. Cohen P. Trigon S. Morange M. Alonso-Llamazares A. Zamanillo D. Hunt T. Nebreda A.R. Cell. 1994; 78: 1027-1037Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1503) Google Scholar, 19Cuenda A. Rouse J. Doza Y.N. Meier R. Cohen P. Gallagher T.F. Young P.R. Lee J.C. FEBS Lett. 1995; 364: 229-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (1980) Google Scholar), was gradually activated during differentiation (half-time 1.5 days) and became maximally activated after 6 days as shown by the finding that no further activation occurred upon stimulation with anisomycin (Fig. 1 A). Similarly, p70 S6 kinase, whose activation is prevented by rapamycin, was gradually activated during differentiation (half-time 1 day), being maximally activated after 3 days as shown by the failure of PMA to increase activity further (Fig. 1 B). These experiments also indicated that the expression of MAPKAP-K2 and p70 S6 kinase do not alter during differentiation. In contrast to MAPKAP-K2 and p70 S6 kinase, p42 MAPK of the classical MAPK cascade was not activated at all during differentiation but was activated 6-fold in response to PMA (Fig. 1 C). SAPK1/JNK was not activated significantly up to the first 3 days of differentiation, at which stage multinucleated myotubes predominated, but was slightly activated (1.8-fold) at 6 days when the myotubes were fully formed (Fig. 1 D). The stimulation of myoblasts (day zero) or myotubes (day six) with anisomycin caused a four-fold activation of SAPK1/JNK (Fig. 1 D). PKBα, which is activated in vivo via a phosphatidylinositide (PI) 3-kinase-dependent pathway, was slightly activated up to 6 days, but activation was only 5–10% of that which occurred after stimulation for a few minutes with IGF-1 (Fig.1 E). To further investigate the mechanisms involved in differentiation, we studied the effects of several inhibitors of particular signal transduction pathways on C2C12 cell morphology during differentiation. During the first 24 h of differentiation, the myoblasts elongated and aligned with each other while, in the following 48 h, multinucleated contractile myotubes were formed (Fig. 2 B). When 10 μm SB 203580 was added to the differentiation medium, cells remained quiescent, and a delay in the elongation and alignment of myoblasts was observed after 3 days (Fig. 2 C). Furthermore, even after 6 days in differentiation medium (data not shown), SB 203580 prevented the fusion of C2C12 myoblasts into multinucleated myotubes. Myotube formation was also largely (but not completely) blocked when 100 nm rapamycin or 10 μm LY 294002 (an inhibitor of PI 3-kinase) was present in the differentiation medium (Figs. 2, D and E). Consistent with the MAPK pathway not becoming activated during differentiation, 50 μm PD 098059 did not affect the rate of myotube formation (Fig. 2 F) although the PMA-induced activation of MAPK was strongly suppressed by PD 098059 (Fig.1 C). We next studied the effects of inhibitors on the expression or activity of several proteins whose levels rise during muscle differentiation (Fig. 3). SB 203580, rapamycin, and LY 294002 severely inhibited the induction of creatine kinase, myogenin, and myosin heavy chain after 3 days. In contrast, the induction of p21 was only partially suppressed by SB 203580 or rapamycin but was prevented by LY 294002. PD 098059 did not inhibit the induction of any of the four differentiation markers studied but actually appeared to increase creatine kinase activity. The level of p42 MAPK, which is not a muscle-specific protein, did not change during C2C12 differentiation and was not affected by any of the inhibitors (Fig. 3). The lack of myotube formation in the presence of 10 μm SB 203580 or 100 nm rapamycin and the strong activation of MAPKAP-K2 and p70 S6 kinase during the conversion of C2C12 myoblasts to myotubes indicated that SAPK2/p38 and a rapamycin-sensitive pathway are required for differentiation. As expected from previous work in other cell types, SB 203580 inhibited the activation of MAPKAP-K2, and rapamycin inhibited the activation of p70 S6 kinase (Fig. 4). Unexpectedly however, rapamycin also prevented the activation of MAPKAP-K2, whereas SB 203580 prevented the activation of p70 S6 kinase during the differentiation process (Fig. 4). In contrast, rapamycin had no effect on the acute activation of MAPKAP-K2 induced by anisomycin (Fig.5 A), and SB 203580 had no effect on the acute activation of p70 S6 kinase by PMA, in myotubes (Fig. 5 B). Consistent with the effects of SB 203580 and rapamycin on the activation of MAPKAP-K2 and p70 S6 kinase, respectively, these inhibitors also prevented the induction of creatine kinase activity (Fig. 4 C). The activation of MAPKAP-K2 and p70 S6 kinase, and the induction of creatine kinase during C2C12 differentiation, were also suppressed by LY 294002 (Fig. 4).Figure 5The acute activation of MAPKAP-K2 by anisomycin is not blocked by rapamycin, and the PMA-induced activation of p70 S6 kinase is not blocked by SB 203580. C2C12 myoblasts were incubated for 30 min at 37 °C in the absence or presence of 10 μm SB203580 or 100 nm rapamycin and then stimulated for 30 min with 10 μg/ml anisomycin (A) or for 15 min with 300 ng/ml PMA (B) in the continued presence or absence of these compounds. The cells were lysed, and MAPKAP-K2 (A) or p70 S6 kinase (B) were immunoprecipitated from the lysates and their activities assayed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The results are presented as mean ± S.E. for three separate experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The elevation in creatine kinase activity (Fig. 4 C) during differentiation paralleled the rise in the activation of MAPKAP-K2 (Fig. 4 A) and p70 S6 kinase (Fig. 4 B). The activation of MAPKAP-K2 and the induction of creatine kinase were both blocked by SB 203580 with IC50 values of <1 μm (Fig. 6 A). The conversion of C2C12 myoblasts to myotubes was suppressed by SB 203580 at a similar concentration (Fig. 6 B). SAPK3 (also termed ERK6 (31Lechner C. Zahalka M.A. Giot J.F. Moller N.P.H. Ullrich A.

Commun. 1996; 228: 334-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar)) is a MAPK family member that, when overexpressed in cell lines, can be activated by the same cellular stresses and proinflammatory cytokines as SAPK2/p38 (20Cuenda A. Cohen P. Buee-Scherrer V. Goedert M. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 295-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). Moreover, SAPK3 mRNA expression is induced during the differentiation of C2C12 cells, and overexpression of SAPK3 in C2C12 cells enhances the fusion rate of the myoblasts (31Lechner C. Zahalka M.A. Giot J.F. Moller N.P.H. Ullrich A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 4355-4359Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). In the present study, we confirmed that the level of SAPK3 increases during C2C12 myotube formation (Fig.7 A) and also showed that induction is prevented by either SB 203580 or rapamycin (Fig.7 B) but not by PD 098059 (data not shown). Previous work suggested both positive and negative roles for the classical MAPK cascade in the differentiation of myoblast cell lines to multinucleated myotubes (see the Introduction), but in this study, we failed to find any evidence for a role for p42 MAPK in C2C12 myogenesis. The differentiation of C2C12 cells was not accompanied by any activation or inhibition of p42 MAPK (Fig. 1 C). Moreover, PD 098059, which prevents activation of the MAPK pathway, had no apparent effect on myotube formation (Fig. 2 F) or on the expression of differentiation markers such as p21, myogenin, or myosin heavy chain (Fig. 3). Instead, SB 203580, a specific inhibitor of SAPK2/p38, which is a MAPK family member that lies in a distinct protein kinase cascade, blocked myotube formation (Fig. 2 C) and the expression of muscle-specific proteins and at concentrations similar to those that suppressed SAPK2/p38 activity in vivo(Figs. 4 C and 6). SB 203580 also prevented the expression of SAPK3, a MAPK family member that is highly expressed in skeletal muscle. It is possible that the suppression of myotube formation that occurs when the MAPK phosphatase MKP1 is overexpressed in C2C12 cells (13Bennett A.M. Tonks N.K. Science. 1997; 278: 1288-1291Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar) results from the inactivation of SAPK2/p38 and/or SAPK3, rather than inactivation of MAPK (see the Introduction). Myotube formation and muscle-specific gene expression is also blocked by rapamycin in C2C12 (Figs. 2 and 3) or L6A1 myoblasts (10Coolican S.A. Samuel D.S. Ewton D.Z. McWade F.J. Florini J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6653-6662Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (555) Google Scholar). Rapamycin interacts with FK506-binding protein (FKBP), and the rapamycin·FKBP complex then inhibits the protein kinase termed mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) (33Brown E.J. Albers M.A. Shin T.B. Ichikawa K. Keith C.T. Lane W.S. Schreilber S.L. Nature. 1994; 369: 756-758Crossref PubMed Scopus (1665) Google Scholar). mTOR phosphorylates 4EBP1, which may stimulate protein synthesis by triggering its dissociation from eIF4E (34Brunn G.J. Hudson C.C. Sekulic A. Williams J.M. Hosoi H. Houghton P.J. Lawrence Jr., J.C. Abraham R.T. Science. 1997; 277: 99-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (809) Google Scholar). mTOR is also required for the activation of p70 S6 kinase (35Calvo V. Crews C.M. Vik T.A. Bierer B.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 7571-7575Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar), but whether it phosphorylates p70 S6 kinase directly or suppresses the activity of a p70 S6 kinase phosphatase is unclear. LY 294002 is best known as an inhibitor of PI 3-kinase (24Vlahos C.J. Matter W.F. Hui K.Y. Brown R.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5241-5248Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), but it also inhibits other members of the PI 3-kinase superfamily. This includes mTOR, which is inhibited by LY 294002 with an IC50of 5 μm (36Brunn G.J. Williams J.M. Sabers C. Wiederrecht G. Lawrence Jr., J.C. Abraham R.T. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5256-5267Crossref PubMed Scopus (626) Google Scholar). The blockade of C2C12 myogenesis by 10 μm LY 294002 could therefore be explained by the inhibition of mTOR, rather than the inhibition of PI 3-kinase. This would be consistent with the slight activation of PI 3-kinase during differentiation, which is indicated by the minute activation of PKB (Fig. 1 E). However, LY 294002 completely prevents the induction of p21, whereas rapamycin only has a partial effect (Fig. 3). LY 294002 must therefore suppress the induction of p21, at least in part, by a rapamycin-insensitive pathway. SAPK2/p38 is not inhibited by rapamycin (data not shown), and rapamycin does not prevent the acute activation of SAPK2/p38 by anisomycin (Fig.5). It was therefore surprising that the slow (but strong) activation of SAPK2/p38 during C2C12 differentiation is suppressed by rapamycin (Fig. 4). This suggests that a rapamycin-sensitive pathway may induce the expression of a factor that triggers the activation of SAPK2/p38. Another unexpected observation was that the slow (but strong) activation of p70 S6 kinase during differentiation is not only blocked by rapamycin but also by SB 203580. SB 203580 does not inhibit mTOR because phorbol ester-induced activation of p70 S6 kinase (which is blocked by rapamycin) (Fig. 5) is unaffected by SB 203580. This suggests that the activation of SAPK2/p38 induces the expression of a factor that triggers the activation of mTOR and p70 S6 kinase. An intriguing possibility is that SAPK2/p38 and mTOR are both required to induce the same factor(s), which then activates both pathways creating a positive feedback loop that drives differentiation to completion. Whatever the mechanism, our results strongly suggest that SAPK2/p38 and mTOR both play essential roles in the differentiation of C2C12 myoblasts to myotubes. We thank Dr. G. Thomas and Dr. A. Prescott for help with the culturing and microscopy of C2C12 cells."

We have shown previously that although many receptor tyrosine kinase ligands are mitogens for keratinocytes, cell migration and induction of the 92-kilodalton gelatinase/matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-9 are selectively regulated by the epidermal growth factor and scatter factor/hepatocyte growth factor receptors. In this report we present evidence of an underlying mechanism to account for these observed differences in receptor tyrosine kinase-mediated response. Ligands that are mitogenic, but do not induce MMP-9 or colony dispersion, transiently activate the p42/p44 ERK/MAP kinases. In contrast, ligands that stimulate MMP-9 induction and colony dispersion induced sustained activation of these kinases. The functional significance of sustained MAPK activation was demonstrated by inhibition of the MAP kinase kinase MEK1. Disruption of the prolonged signal by addition of the MEK1 inhibitor PD 98059 up to 4 h after growth factor stimulation substantially impaired ligand-dependent colony dispersion and MMP-9 induction. These findings support the conclusion that duration of MAPK activation is an important determinant for certain growth factor-mediated functions in keratinocytes.

Cobb M.H. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 180-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (2286) Google Scholar). The MAPK/ERK cascade is best characterized for its involvement in mitogenic signaling (3Robinson M.J.

Schirrmacher V. Lichtner R.B. Cancer Metastasis Rev. 1993; 12: 255-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). In addition to promoting mitogenic responses in target cells, these receptors are also capable of regulating cellular functions that are involved in the acquisition of an invasive phenotype such as modulation of cellular attachments, proteolysis of extracellular matrix, and directional migration (2Heldin C.H. Cancer Surv. 1996; 27: 7-24PubMed Google Scholar, 11Khazaie K. Schirrmacher V. Lichtner R.B. Cancer Metastasis Rev. 1993; 12: 255-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar, 12Lauffenburger D.A.

Many growth factors have been reported to stimulate keratinocyte migration, and it has been shown that receptor tyrosine kinase and integrin-induced cell migration involve activation of the Ras/MAPK signal transduction pathway (9Klemke R.

In the course of previous studies, we have shown that although many receptor tyrosine kinase ligands are mitogenic for keratinocytes, only a subset of receptors, the epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor and c-Met (scatter factor/hepatocyte growth factor receptor), were also motogenic (16McCawley L.J. Obrien P. Hudson L.G. J. Cell. Physiol. 1998; 176: 255-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Receptor specificity for stimulating migration coincided with ligand-mediated invasion through a reconstituted basement membrane and induction of MMP-9. An association between MMP-9 expression and keratinocyte migration is suggested by detection of MMP-9 during wound healing and the correlation between MMP-9 expression and squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) invasiveness (13Boyd D. Cancer Metastasis Rev. 1996; 15: 77-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 20Salo T. Makela M. Kylmaniemi M. Autio-Harmainen H. Larjava H. Lab.

In our studies, we found that MMP-9 plays a functional role in EGF- and SF/HGF-induced migration, as inhibition of MMP-9 activity impaired receptor tyrosine kinase-dependent SCC locomotion. The present study focuses on the signaling requirements for receptor tyrosine kinase-dependent MMP-9 induction, and we present evidence of an underlying basis for receptor specificity in the regulation of keratinocyte migration and invasion. In particular, we investigated the apparent paradox that although the MAPK pathway is essential for receptor tyrosine kinase-induced mitogenesis, there is demonstrable receptor specificity with regard to regulation of MMP-9 expression and cell migration. We find that although ligand-dependent activation of the ERK and JNK pathways was readily detected, sustained activation of p42/p44 ERK/MAPK following growth factor stimulation was associated with induction of MMP-9 expression and keratinocyte motility. Furthermore, attenuation of the sustained signal by inhibition of MEK1 abrogated ligand-induced MMP-9 expression and migration. These results suggest that ligand-dependent regulation of cellular responses related to an invasive phenotype is dictated by the capacity of certain receptor tyrosine kinases to stimulate sustained activation of the MAPK signaling cascade. SCC-12F cells were originally derived from a tumor of the facial epidermis (23Rheinwald J.G. Beckett M.A. Cancer Res. 1981; 41: 1657-1663PubMed Google Scholar) and were generously provided by Dr. William A. Toscano, Jr. (Tulane University, New Orleans, LA). SCC-12F cells were maintained in a 1:1 mixture of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium: Ham's F-12 nutrient mixture (DMEM:F-12) containing 5% iron-supplemented defined calf serum (HyClone Laboratories, Inc., Logan, UT). For all experiments involving growth factor addition, SCC cells were placed into DMEM:F-12 containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin (BSA) for 24–48 h prior to growth factor addition. Murine EGF was obtained from Biomedical Technologies Inc. (Stoughton, MA); keratinocyte growth factor (KGF) was purchased from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. (Lake Placid, NY), and scatter factor/hepatocyte growth factor (SF/HGF) was a generous gift from Genentech. All other growth factors were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. PD 98059 and SB202190 were obtained from Calbiochem and dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO). The final concentration of Me2SO did not exceed 0.1% (v/v) in any experiment. Evaluation of colony dispersion (cell scattering) was performed as described previously (24McCawley L.J. O'Brien P. Hudson L.G. Endocrinology. 1996; 138: 121-127Crossref Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were subcultured and maintained in growth medium until colonies of greater than 16 cells were established. Cultures were deprived of growth factors and serum for 24 h prior to treatment with or without ligand at the concentrations and times indicated in the figure legends. Colony dispersion was documented by photography. Photographs of cell cultures were taken at a magnification of × 10 or × 25 using a Nikon N2000 camera mounted upon a Nikon Diaphot-TMD inverted phase contrast microscope. Results shown are representative of at least three independent experiments. Activated MAPK species were detected using phosphospecific antibodies directed against the dually phosphorylated, active forms of the proteins according to the vendor's instructions. Parallel control blots were obtained using phosphorylation state-independent pan antibodies for detection of the MAPK species. SCC-12F cells were serum-deprived for 24 h prior to stimulation with ligand at the concentrations and for the times indicated in the figure legends. Control and treated cells were rinsed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and then lysed in sample buffer containing 62.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 10% glycerol, 50 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.1% w/v bromphenol blue. Typically, 10 μg of total cell lysate for each sample was separated on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and then transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA). Membranes were blocked with 2% milk in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20 (TBST) for 30 min at room temperature. Membranes were then incubated with primary antibody at 1:1000 dilution in TBST containing 0.25% gelatin (TBSTG) overnight at 4 °C for the phospho-specific phospho-p44/42 MAPK kinase (Thr202/Tyr204) monoclonal antibody (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA). Membranes were then washed in TBSTG for 15 min at room temperature, followed by incubation with a 1:2500 dilution of goat anti-rabbit-conjugated horseradish peroxidase secondary antibody (Promega, Madison, WI) for 1 h at room temperature. The membranes were washed with TBST for 1 h at room temperature and developed using the SuperSignal chemiluminescent detection system (Pierce). Detection of total ERK was accomplished using a pan-ERK antibody (Transduction Labs, Lexington, KY). Membranes were incubated with primary antibody at a 1:5000 dilution in TBSTG for 30 min at 37 °C, washed with TBSTG as above, and then incubated with a 1:10,000 dilution of goat anti-mouse-conjugated horseradish peroxidase secondary antibody (Promega, Madison, WI) for 1 h at room temperature.

Briefly, cells were incubated in a 5% CO2 humidified incubator at 37 °C in DMEM:F-12, 0.1% BSA in the presence or absence of the indicated agent. Cells were then washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and harvested in lysis buffer. JNK lysis buffer contained 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 300 mmNaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 20 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mmNa3VO4, 20 μg/ml aprotinin, 50 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. p38 lysis buffer contained 20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, 1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 137 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, 25 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mmNa3VO4, 2 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin. Cell lysates were centrifuged at 10,000 × g, 4 °C for 10–20 min. The protein concentration of the supernatant was quantitated using the Bradford Assay (Bio-Rad, Cambridge, MA). 200 μg of protein was incubated with 5 μl of the appropriate antibody and 25 μl of protein A-agarose at 4 °C for 1–2 h. The immunocomplexes were washed and incubated in kinase buffer as follows. JNK was incubated at 30 °C for 20 min in kinase buffer (12.5 mm MOPS, pH 7.5, 20 mmβ-glycerophosphate, 7.5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm EGTA, 0.5 mm Na3VO4, 0.5 mm NaF) in the presence of 1 μg of glutathioneS-transferase-c-Jun and 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP. p38 was incubated at 30 °C for 20 min in kinase buffer (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 25 mmβ-glycerophosphate, 25 mm MgCl2, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mmNa3VO4) in the presence of 2 μg of glutathione S-transferase-ATF-2 and 7.5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP. The kinase reactions were terminated by the addition of Laemmli sample buffer. The proteins were resolved using 10% SDS-PAGE mini-gels. Substrate phosphorylation was detected by autoradiography and quantified using a Bio-Rad model GS-700 Imaging Densitometer. SCC-12F cells were serum-deprived for 24 h prior to growth factor treatment in fresh serum-free medium. Conditioned medium (CM) collected from control (untreated) and growth factor-treated cell cultures was analyzed for proteinase activity by substrate-gel zymography as described previously (16McCawley L.J. Obrien P. Hudson L.G. J. Cell. Physiol. 1998; 176: 255-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Equal total protein from experimental samples was fractionated on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels containing 0.1% gelatin. Following electrophoresis, gels were washed with 2.5% Triton X-100 for 30 min at room temperature and then incubated with substrate buffer (50 mm Tris, 0.2 m NaCl, 5 mmCaCl2, 0.02% Brij, pH 7.6) 24–48 h at 37 °C. Proteinase activity is visualized as clear areas in a Coomassie Blue-stained gel. Results shown are representative of a minimum of three independent experiments.

We have shown previously that not all mitogenic ligands for keratinocytes are capable of inducing MMP-9 expression and colony dispersion; rather, only activation of a small subset of receptors (the EGF receptor and c-Met) regulate these cellular processes (16McCawley L.J. Obrien P. Hudson L.G. J. Cell. Physiol. 1998; 176: 255-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Other studies have shown that MAPK activity is essential for MMP-9 expression in oncogenic transformed rat embryo cells and in tumorigenic SCC cells displaying constitutive activation of both ERK and JNK/SAPK (17Himelstein B.P. Lee E.J. Sato H. Seiki M. Muschel R.J. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 1995-1998Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 18Gum R. Wang H. Lengyel E. Juarez J. Boyd D. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 1481-1493Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). As stimulation of the Ras/MAPK pathway is shared by receptor tyrosine kinases, but only a limited number of receptors induced MMP-9 expression in keratinocytes, we investigated whether MAPK activity was essential for growth factor-mediated MMP-9 induction in a human keratinocyte cell line. Both ERK1 (p42-kDa MAPK) and ERK2 (p44-kDa MAPK) are activated by the MAP kinase kinase MEK1 (28Mansour S.J. Matten W.T. Hermann A.S. Candia J.M. Rong S. Fukasawa K. Vande Woude G.F. Ahn N.G. Science. 1994; 265: 966-970Crossref PubMed Scopus (1263) Google Scholar). The inhibitor PD 98059 prevents activation of MEK1 by upstream kinases (29Alessi D.R. Cuenda A. Cohen P. Dudley D.T. Saltiel A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27489-27494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3259) Google Scholar) and has been reported to selectively inhibit the ERK/MAP kinase pathway. MAPK activity has been shown to be required for cell migration (9Klemke R. Yebra M. Bayna E. Cheresh D.A. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 859-866Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar, 10Hartmann G. Weidner K.M. Schwarz H. Birchmeier W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21936-21939Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), so we determined the concentrations of PD 98059 that effectively inhibited ligand-dependent colony dispersion. SCC-12F cells were stimulated with epidermal growth factor (EGF) or scatter factor/hepatocyte growth factor (SF/HGF) in the presence or absence of the MEK1 inhibitor PD 98059, and ligand-dependent colony dispersion was evaluated (Fig. 1,A–F). When SCC-12F cells were incubated with increasing concentrations of PD 98059 for 15 min prior to growth factor stimulation, partial abatement of EGF-mediated colony dispersion was detected with 10 μm PD 98059, and complete inhibition of the response was detected at 30 μm PD 98059 (Fig. 1,D and E). These concentrations are consistent with those reported for half-maximal (IC50 = 2 μm) and complete (50 μm) inhibition of MEK1 by PD 98059 in vitro (29Alessi D.R. Cuenda A. Cohen P. Dudley D.T. Saltiel A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27489-27494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3259) Google Scholar). A similar PD 98059-dependent impairment of migration was noted when cells were stimulated with SF/HGF (data not shown). Our previous studies demonstrated that MMP-9 plays a functional role in ligand-dependent colony dispersion (16McCawley L.J. Obrien P. Hudson L.G. J. Cell. Physiol. 1998; 176: 255-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar); therefore, we investigated whether MAPK activation was essential for EGF or SF/HGF-dependent induction of MMP-9. Gelatin zymography was performed on conditioned media collected 24 h after ligand stimulation in the presence and absence of PD 98059 (Fig.2). The MEK1 inhibitor PD 98059 had no effect on basal MMP-9 levels (Fig. 2); however, preincubation of cells with concentrations of PD 98059 that inhibited colony dispersion (Fig.1, E and F) reduced EGF- and SF/HGF-induced MMP-9 expression (Fig. 2). Together, these results demonstrate that inhibition of MEK1 impairs receptor tyrosine kinase-dependent colony dispersion and MMP-9 induction, suggesting that ERK1 and/or ERK2 activation is essential for these responses in a human keratinocyte cell line. MEK1 activates both the p42 and p44 ERKs, and the ERK/MAPK pathway is involved in receptor tyrosine kinase-regulated mitogenic responses, yet many mitogenic ligands were unable to promote keratinocyte colony dispersion or MMP-9 induction (9Klemke R. Yebra M. Bayna E. Cheresh D.A. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 859-866Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar,10Hartmann G. Weidner K.M. Schwarz H. Birchmeier W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21936-21939Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16McCawley L.J. Obrien P. Hudson L.G. J. Cell. Physiol. 1998; 176: 255-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Our findings indicate that the ERK/MAPK pathway is required for EGF- and SF/HGF-dependent colony dispersion and MMP-9 induction (Figs. 1 and 2, data not shown). Therefore, we tested selected motogenic and non-motogenic ligands to determine whether growth factor-dependent activation of specific MAPK isoforms was associated with the observed differences in response. The concentration of growth factors (typically 10 nm) used to stimulate cells corresponded to concentrations previously reported to induce a mitogenic response in this cell line (16McCawley L.J. Obrien P. Hudson L.G. J. Cell. Physiol. 1998; 176: 255-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Activated p42 and p44 ERKs were detected using a phospho-specific antibody that only recognizes the dually phosphorylated and active form of the MAP kinase (30Anderson N.G. Maller J.L. Tonks N.K. Sturgill T.W. Nature. 1990; 343: 651-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (797) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 3, serum-deprived SCC-12F cells displayed low basal MAPK activation in the absence of growth factor and stimulation of cells with EGF rapidly induced ERK1 and ERK2 activation (Fig. 3 A). When the activities of different growth factors were compared, EGF, SF/HGF, insulin-like growth factor (IGF) 1, and keratinocyte growth factor (KGF) all induced ERK1 and ERK2 activation (Fig. 3, A—D). Therefore, selective activation of a particular MAPK isoform (p42 or p44 ERK) did not account for the functional differences between motogenic and non-motogenic receptor tyrosine kinases. These findings were confirmed in an in-gel kinase assay using myelin basic protein as a substrate (data not shown). In addition to activation of specific MAPK isoforms, variations in duration of MAPK activation has been associated with differences in functional outcome in response to receptor tyrosine kinase ligands (8Qui M.S. Green S.H. Neuron. 1992; 9: 705-717Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar,31Marshall C.J. Cell. 1995; 80: 179-185Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4243) Google Scholar). We have shown that ERK activation is required for EGF- and SF/HGF-dependent MMP-9 induction and colony dispersion (Figs. 1 and 2, data not shown); however, ERK1 and ERK2 were activated by ligands (KGF and IGF-1) that do not induce either of these responses (Ref. 16McCawley L.J. Obrien P. Hudson L.G. J. Cell. Physiol. 1998; 176: 255-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar, Fig. 3). Therefore, we evaluated the duration of MAPK activation following stimulation with motogenic and non-motogenic growth factors. Stimulation of serum-deprived SCC-12F cells by EGF or SF/HGF resulted in a rapid activation of p42 and p44 ERK that was sustained for up to 6 h (Figs. 3 and 4, data not shown). This is in contrast to the response observed after stimulation with IGF-1 or KGF, where the typical duration of MAPK activation did not exceed 1 h before returning to base-line levels (Fig. 3). Thus, ligands that promote keratinocyte migration and MMP-9 induction also stimulate a prolonged duration of ERK1 and ERK2 activation. As shown in Figs. 3 and4, there is a correspondence between growth factors that promote sustained ERK1/2 activation and those that induce colony dispersion and MMP-9 activity. There is evidence that the JNK/SAPK and p38 pathways are also involved in expression of MMP-9 (13Boyd D. Cancer Metastasis Rev. 1996; 15: 77-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar,17Himelstein B.P. Lee E.J. Sato H. Seiki M. Muschel R.J. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 1995-1998Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 18Gum R. Wang H. Lengyel E. Juarez J. Boyd D. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 1481-1493Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar, 19Simon C. Goepfert H. Boyd D. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 1135-1139PubMed Google Scholar), and constitutive activation of JNK/SAPK is detected in UM-SCC-1 cells displaying high basal MMP-9 expression (18Gum R. Wang H. Lengyel E. Juarez J. Boyd D. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 1481-1493Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). Therefore, we wanted to determine if specific receptor tyrosine kinase ligands differed in their ability to activate stress-activated members of the MAPK family. We monitored activation of JNK and p38 by EGF, IGF-1, SF/HGF, and KGF by measurement of catalytic activity in immunocomplex assays (26Osborn M.T. Chambers T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30950-30955Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar, 27Raingeaud J. Gupta S. Rogers J.S. Dickens M. Han J. Ulevitch R.J. Davis R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7420-7426Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2046) Google Scholar). The motogenic ligands EGF and SF/HGF stimulated robust activation of JNK (∼10-fold); KGF was a more modest JNK activator (∼5-fold), and IGF-1 did not stimulate JNK activation (Fig.5). The time courses of EGF and SF-HGF-stimulated JNK activation were similar with JNK activity detected within 5 min, and peak activity was observed between 15 and 30 min, and activity returned to background levels within 2 h (Fig.5). KGF also stimulated JNK activation, with maximal activity apparent at the 15-min time point. It has been reported that the p38HOG pathway is not typically activated by receptor tyrosine kinase-dependent signals (3Robinson M.J. Cobb M.H. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 180-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (2286) Google Scholar, 7Han J. Lee J.-D. Bibbs L. Ulevitch R.J. Science. 1994; 265: 808-811Crossref PubMed Scopus (2420) Google Scholar); however, EGF-dependent activation of p38 has been reported (27Raingeaud J. Gupta S. Rogers J.S. Dickens M. Han J. Ulevitch R.J. Davis R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7420-7426Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2046) Google Scholar). Modest activation (3–5-fold) of p38 was detected in response to EGF, SF/HGF, and KGF, but not IGF-1, in SCC-12F cells (Fig.6, data not shown). As with JNK, the activation was transient with a return to base-line activity within 2 h for EGF and KGF. In contrast, SF/HGF appeared to stimulate a low (2–3-fold) but sustained activation of p38. Although phorbol ester-induced MMP-9 expression is eliminated by the p38 inhibitor SB 203580 (19Simon C. Goepfert H. Boyd D. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 1135-1139PubMed Google Scholar), EGF-mediated migration and MMP-9 induction were essentially unimpaired by the p38 inhibitor SB202190 (data not shown). Taken together, these findings suggest that the p38HOG pathway does not play a central role in growth factor-induced keratinocyte migration or MMP-9 expression or account for receptor specificity in the regulation of these cellular responses. As shown in Figs. 3 and 4, prolonged activation of the p42/p44 ERKs corresponded with the capacity of specific receptor tyrosine kinases to promote keratinocyte migration and MMP-9 induction. In order to determine the potential significance of sustained ERK activation for these two cellular responses, MAPK activation following EGF or SF/HGF stimulation was disrupted by inhibiting MEK1 with PD 98059 at various times after growth factor addition. MMP-9 activity was analyzed in conditioned medium collected from SCC-12F cells treated with EGF in the absence or presence of PD 98059 added at various time points after growth factor addition (Fig.7 A). Ligand-dependent induction of MMP-9 was inhibited when PD 98059 was added 1 h before EGF addition, when both were administered concurrently and when PD 98059 was added at time points up to 4 h after EGF stimulation (Fig. 7 A). However, addition of the MEK1 inhibitor at time points beyond 4 h after EGF stimulation no longer effectively blocked EGF-dependent MMP-9 induction (Fig. 7 A). This suggests that the MEK1-dependent signal required for MMP-9 induction was fully transmitted by this point. In addition, EGF- and SF/HGF-mediated SCC-12F colony dispersion was inhibited by addition of PD 98059 at time points up to 6 h after growth factor addition (data not shown). To confirm that MAPK activation was inhibited by the MEK1 inhibitor at the extended time points, cell lysates were collected 30 min after treatment with PD 98059, and activated ERKs were detected by immunoblot analysis. As shown in Fig. 7 B, PD 98059 treatment after EGF stimulation effectively blocked the sustained MAPK activation. Thus, inhibition of MEK1 transformed the pattern of EGF-dependent MAPK activation to resemble that observed for IGF-1 and KGF (Fig. 3), and importantly, interruption of sustained MAPK activation resulted in loss of the EGF-dependent cellular responses (Fig. 7, data not shown). Together, these findings indicate that sustained activation of the MAPK signaling cascade is required for receptor tyrosine kinase-dependent MMP-9 induction and cell migration. We have demonstrated previously that growth factor-regulated keratinocyte migration and MMP-9 induction is selectively mediated by the EGF receptor and c-Met in SCC lines and normal human keratinocytes (16McCawley L.J. Obrien P. Hudson L.G. J. Cell. Physiol. 1998; 176: 255-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). The mechanisms responsible for specificity of response to different receptor tyrosine kinases remain unclear; however, it has been proposed that the duration of ERK activation may determine cellular responses to ligand. In one well characterized example, nerve growth factor causes sustained ERK activation and promotes PC12 cell differentiation, whereas differentiation is not induced by EGF which only transiently activates ERKs within this cell type (31Marshall C.J. Cell. 1995; 80: 179-185Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4243) Google Scholar, 33Heasley L.E. Johnson G.L. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1992; 3: 545-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 34Traverse S. Gomez N. Paterson H. Marshall C. Cohen P. Biochem. J. 1992; 288: 351-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (807) Google Scholar). In this report we present evidence that sustained versustransient activation of the ERK/MAPK signaling cascade represents an underlying mechanism to account for receptor tyrosine kinase specificity in ligand-induced keratinocyte migration and MMP-9 induction. Both IGF-1 and KGF transiently activate the ERK/MAPK pathway and stimulate keratinocyte proliferation but do not induce colony dispersion or MMP-9 expression (Ref. 16McCawley L.J. Obrien P. Hudson L.G. J. Cell. Physiol. 1998; 176: 255-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar, Figs. 3 and 4). In contrast, EGF- and SF/HGF-mediated motility and MMP-9 induction are associated with sustained duration of MAPK activation (Figs. 3, 4, and 7). In examining the signaling consequences of receptor tyrosine kinase activation, we found that ligand stimulation enhances activity of similar MAPK constituents (p42/p44 ERK) regardless of the functional outcome (Figs. 3 and 4). The distinguishing characteristic of receptors that regulate MMP-9 induction and colony dispersion is their ability to promote prolonged ERK activation (Figs. 3, 4, and 7 B). Importantly, interruption of the sustained signal using the MEK1 inhibitor PD 98059 rendered EGF inactive for migration and MMP-9 induction (Fig. 7, data not shown), indicating that prolonged duration of MAPK activation is required for both of these cellular responses. Several lines of evidence indicate that MMP-9gene expression is regulated by activation of various MAP kinase signaling pathways. Oncogenic transformation with v-Src or v-Ras up-regulate MMP-9 expression, as does diverse stimuli such as EGF, tumor necrosis factor-α, and phorbol ester tumor promoters (35Sato H. Kita M. Seiki M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23460-23468Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 36Gum R. Lengyel E. Juarez J. Chen J.H. Sato H. Seiki M. Boyd D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10672-10680Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). Phorbol ester stimulation of MMP-9 expression was reportedly through the p38HOG pathway as use of the p38 inhibitor SB203580 blocked phorbol ester-dependent MMP-9 induction and cell invasion but not mitogenesis (19Simon C. Goepfert H. Boyd D. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 1135-1139PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, disruption of the ERK- or JNK-dependent signaling decreases endogenous MMP-9 expression in UM-SCC-1 cells (18Gum R. Wang H. Lengyel E. Juarez J. Boyd D. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 1481-1493Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). Although the JNK and p38 MAPK cascades may be necessary for induction of MMP-9 in response to various stimuli, our data suggest that neither pathway is sufficient for growth factor-stimulated MMP-9 expression. JNK and p38 activities were induced by KGF (Figs. 5 and 6) even though KGF does not induce MMP-9 in these cells (16McCawley L.J. Obrien P. Hudson L.G. J. Cell. Physiol. 1998; 176: 255-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Duration of ERK activation corresponds to this receptor-mediated response, and it is intriguing that MAPK-dependent up-regulation of MMP-9 expression is apparent in several systems where MAPK is constitutively activated either through oncogenic transformation or endogenously as part of the transformed phenotype (17Himelstein B.P. Lee E.J. Sato H. Seiki M. Muschel R.J. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 1995-1998Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 18Gum R. Wang H. Lengyel E. Juarez J. Boyd D. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 1481-1493Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar, 32.Deleted in proof.Google Scholar, 36Gum R. Lengyel E. Juarez J. Chen J.H. Sato H. Seiki M. Boyd D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10672-10680Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). These studies, together with our findings, suggest that prolonged activation of MAPK activity may be a general requirement for induction of MMP-9 expression. Constitutive up-regulation of MMP-9 through oncogenic transformation by v-Ras has been reported to be through a MEK1-independent activation of MAPK (36Gum R. Lengyel E. Juarez J. Chen J.H. Sato H. Seiki M. Boyd D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10672-10680Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). In contrast, our results demonstrate that PD 98059 interferes with growth factor-induced ERK activation and MMP-9 expression, suggesting that receptor tyrosine kinase-mediated MMP-9 induction requires a MEK1-dependent pathway. The requirement for MEK1 activity in the sustained MAPK activation as detected in this system suggests that input from upstream signaling effectors, such as MEK1, is involved in the duration of MAPK activation. Interestingly, there is also evidence that prolonged MAPK activation may play a role in cell migration. Sustained ERK2 activation has been correlated with Ret- and fibroblast growth factor-mediated scattering in SK-N-MC cells (37van Puijenbroek A.A.F.L. van Weering D.H.J. van den Brink C.E. Bos J.L. van der Saag P.T. de Laat S.W. den Hertog J. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 1147-1157Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). This finding, in conjunction with our results, suggests that sustained ERK2 activation is a common requirement for receptor tyrosine kinase-regulated colony dispersion. One possible consequence of sustained ERK activation might be the induction of gene products specifically required for migration. We have shown that MMP-9 activity is involved in growth factor-induced colony dispersion (16McCawley L.J. Obrien P. Hudson L.G. J. Cell. Physiol. 1998; 176: 255-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar), and therefore, MMP-9 may represent one such gene product. Analysis of the MMP-9 promotor has identified potential cis acting elements such as the 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate-response element, Ets, and NF-kB that are likely to confer induction of MMP-9 in response to growth factors or oncogenic transformation (17Himelstein B.P. Lee E.J. Sato H. Seiki M. Muschel R.J. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 1995-1998Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 35Sato H. Kita M. Seiki M. J. Biol.

Chem. 1996; 271: 10672-10680Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). Interestingly, in one model system where cells displayed constitutive activation of MAPK as part of the transformed phenotype, the accompanying up-regulation of MMP-9 expression was dependent upon AP-1/12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate response element sites within the MMP-9 promotor region and one of the essential 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate response elements bound a Jun D/c-Fos heterodimer (18Gum R. Wang H. Lengyel E. Juarez J. Boyd D. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 1481-1493Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). A possible mechanism by which sustained MAPK activation could result in MMP-9 induction is through regulation of essential transcription factors such as c-Fos. Expression of this immediate early gene is dependent on MAPK activation, and furthermore, phosphorylation of c-Fos by MAPK enhances its activity (38Chen R.H. Juo P.C Curran T. Blenis J. Oncogene. 1995; 12: 1493-1502Google Scholar). Thus, in one possible signaling scenario, initial activation of MAPK may be required to induce c-Fos, and sustained activation may serve to enhance c-Fos transcriptional activity and AP1-dependent expression of the MMP-9 gene (18Gum R. Wang H. Lengyel E. Juarez J. Boyd D. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 1481-1493Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar, 38Chen R.H. Juo P.C Curran T. Blenis J. Oncogene. 1995; 12: 1493-1502Google Scholar). It is possible that a sequence of MAPK-dependent induction followed by MAPK-dependent phosphorylation of specific transcription factors may represent a mechanism whereby duration of MAPK activation distinguishes between a mitogenic or motogenic response in target cells. Analysis of the contributions of sustained MAPK activation to differential gene expression will require further study. The ERK/MAPK signal transduction cascade plays an important role in mediating cellular responses to growth factor receptor activation. In a limited number of cellular systems including PC12 cells and K562 megakaryocytes, sustained activation of MAP kinases is a requirement for cell differentiation (8Qui M.S. Green S.H. Neuron. 1992; 9: 705-717Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar, 31Marshall C.J. Cell. 1995; 80: 179-185Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4243) Google Scholar, 34Traverse S.

The findings presented in this paper support the conclusion that sustained activation of MAP kinase signaling cascades may play an important role in dictating other cellular responses such as migration, metalloproteinase expression, and invasive capacity that require de novo protein and RNA expression. Additionally, the ability of a particular receptor tyrosine kinase to promote sustained MAPK activation may serve as an underlying biochemical mechanism to account for receptor specificity in cellular responses to growth factors."
https://openalex.org/W2078424943,"There are two distinct pathways for the removal of modified DNA bases through base excision repair (BER) in vertebrates. Following 5′ incision by AP endonuclease, the pathways diverge as two different excision mechanisms are possible. In short-patch repair, DNA polymerase β accounts for both excision activity and single nucleotide repair synthesis. In long-patch repair, the damage-containing strand is excised by the structure-specific endonuclease FEN-1 and approximately 2–8 nucleotides are incorporated by proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA)-dependent synthesis. PCNA is an accessory factor of DNA polymerases δ and ε that is required for DNA replication and repair. PCNA binds to FEN-1 and stimulates its nuclease activity, but the physiological significance of this interaction is unknown. The importance of the PCNA-FEN-1 interaction in BER was investigated. In a reconstituted BER assay system containing FEN-1, omission of PCNA caused the accumulation of pre-excision reaction intermediates which could be converted to completely repaired product by addition of PCNA. When dNTPs were omitted from the reaction to suppress repair synthesis, PCNA was required for the formation of excised reaction intermediates. In contrast, a PCNA mutant that could not bind to FEN-1 was unable to stimulate excision. To further study this effect, a mutant of FEN-1 was identified that retained full nuclease activity but was specifically defective in binding to PCNA. The mutant FEN-1 exhibited one-tenth the specific activity of wild type FEN-1 in the reconstituted BER assay, and this repair defect was due to a kinetic block at the excision step as evidenced by the accumulation of pre-excision intermediates when dNTPs were omitted. These results indicate that PCNA facilitates excision during long-patch BER through its interaction with FEN-1.

Bases may be modified by deamination, or lost entirely due to hydrolysis of the N-glycosidic bond that links them to the sugar-phosphate backbone. Reactive oxygen species that are the by-products of normal cellular respiration also damage DNA. Exogenous agents such as chemical mutagens and ionizing radiation are additional sources of base modification. Aberrant DNA bases generated by such processes can be restored by base excision repair (BER) 1The abbreviations used are: BER, base excision repair; AP, apurinic/apyrimidinic; dRP, deoxyribose phosphate; FEN-1, flap endonuclease-1; PCNA, proliferating cell nuclear antigen; RF-C, replication factor C; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; PAM, percentage of accepted point mutations; bis-Tris, 2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]-2-(hydroxymethyl)-propane-1,3-diol; IPTG, isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside.1The abbreviations used are: BER, base excision repair; AP, apurinic/apyrimidinic; dRP, deoxyribose phosphate; FEN-1, flap endonuclease-1; PCNA, proliferating cell nuclear antigen; RF-C, replication factor C; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; PAM, percentage of accepted point mutations; bis-Tris, 2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]-2-(hydroxymethyl)-propane-1,3-diol; IPTG, isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside.

A. 1997; 94: 12754-12757Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). This repair system includes several types of DNA glycosylases that recognize and remove many types of modified bases to leave an apurinic or apyrimidinic site (AP site). Alternatively, an AP site may be the direct result of damage. The AP site must be removed during the course of repair. AP endonuclease initiates the process by hydrolyzing the phosphodiester bond immediately to the 5′ side of the abasic site. This enzyme is capable of recognizing various classes of abasic lesions (3Wilson III, D.M. Takeshita M. Grollman A.P. Demple B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16002-16007Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). After this incision has been made, there are two mechanistically distinct methods for AP site removal that distinguish short-patch BER from long-patch BER in higher eukaryotes. Short-patch BER is a DNA polymerase β-dependent pathway that requires an unaltered deoxyribose phosphate (dRP) sugar moiety as the AP site. The 5′-terminal dRP resulting from AP endonuclease incision is removed in a β-elimination reaction catalyzed by DNA polymerase β, leaving a 1-nucleotide gap (4Matsumoto Y. Kim K. Science. 1995; 269: 699-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (646) Google Scholar). Single nucleotide repair synthesis by DNA polymerase β fills the gap, and the nick is sealed by the DNA ligase III/XRCC1 heterodimer or other ligase to complete repair. In long-patch BER, the repair patch size is typically 2–8 nucleotides in length. This pathway also utilizes AP endonuclease for 5′-incision, but the AP site is not removed by DNA polymerase β. Instead, the flap endonuclease/5′-3′ exonuclease FEN-1 (reviewed in Ref. 5Lieber M.R. BioEssays. 1997; 19: 233-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar) removes the 5′-terminal dRP moiety along with at least one adjacent nucleotide to leave a gap of two or more nucleotides (6Klungland A. Lindahl T. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3341-3348Crossref PubMed Scopus (660) Google Scholar, 7Kim K. Biade S. Matsumoto Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8842-8848Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Because it relies on phosphodiester bond hydrolysis for excision, long-patch BER can repair regular AP sites and also altered AP sites that are not susceptible to β-elimination. Sites with oxidized or reduced sugar groups and those with fragmented bases or sugars can be repaired only by long-patch BER. This versatility may be especially important in the repair of DNA damage caused by ionizing radiation. For example, about 80% of the γ-irradiation-induced DNA lesions that can be repaired by BER are resistant to dRP elimination by DNA polymerase β and require FEN-1 for processing (6Klungland A. Lindahl T. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3341-3348Crossref PubMed Scopus (660) Google Scholar). The investigation of long-patch BER in cell extracts and reconstituted assay systems has been aided by the availability of synthetic AP site analogs such as 3-hydroxy-2-hydroxymethyltetrahydrofuran that cannot be repaired by short-patch BER. Repair of such sites requires proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) (Refs. 8Matsumoto Y. Kim K. Bogenhagen D.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6187-6197Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar and 9Biade S. Sobol R.W. Wilson S.H. Matsumoto Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 898-902Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar), a toroidal homotrimeric DNA-binding protein that encircles template DNA. PCNA forms a holoenzyme complex with DNA polymerases δ or ε in conjunction with replication factor C (RF-C), the PCNA loading factor (reviewed in Ref.10Kelman Z. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 629-640Crossref PubMed Scopus (712) Google Scholar). PCNA dependence in long-patch BER has also been demonstrated using a regular AP site as substrate and selectively observing repair patches of greater than 1 nucleotide in length by exploiting strategically placed restriction sites (11Frosina G. Fortini P. Rossi O. Carrozzini F. Raspaglio G. Cox L.S. Lane D.P. Abbondandolo A. Dogliotti E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9573-9578Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar) or position-specific deoxyribonucleotide incorporation (12Fortini P. Pascucci B. Parlanti E. Sobol R.W. Wilson S.H. Dogliotti E. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 3575-3580Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). These results suggest a model in which AP endonuclease, FEN-1, PCNA, RF-C, a PCNA-dependent DNA polymerase, probably DNA polymerase δ, and DNA ligase are used for long-patch BER. Complete repair can be achieved with these proteins (6Klungland A. Lindahl T. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3341-3348Crossref PubMed Scopus (660) Google Scholar, 7Kim K. Biade S. Matsumoto Y. J. Biol.

Biol. 1994; 14: 6187-6197Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar), and cell extracts lacking DNA polymerase β are fully capable of repair (9Biade S. Sobol R.W. Wilson S.H. Matsumoto Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 898-902Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar, 12Fortini P. Pascucci B. Parlanti E. Sobol R.W. Wilson S.H. Dogliotti E. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 3575-3580Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). However, in some assay systems, DNA polymerase β can substitute for the PCNA-DNA polymerase δ holoenzyme complex in FEN-1-dependent BER (6Klungland A. Lindahl T. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3341-3348Crossref PubMed Scopus (660) Google Scholar). PCNA and FEN-1 are capable of direct physical interaction, as first identified by yeast two-hybrid screening (13Li X. Li J. Harrington J. Lieber M.R. Burgers P.M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22109-22112Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar) and confirmed by in vitro binding assays (13Li X. Li J. Harrington J.

Burgers P.M.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6367-6378Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, PCNA can stimulate FEN-1 nuclease activity (13Li X. Li J. Harrington J. Lieber M.R. Burgers P.M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22109-22112Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar, 14Wu X. Li J. Li X. Hsieh C.-L. Burgers P.M.J. Lieber M.R.

Biol. 1997; 17: 6367-6378Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Both proteins participate in DNA replication and long-patch BER, and thus it is likely that these proteins may co-exist within a macromolecular assembly during either of these processes. Because PCNA and FEN-1 have a proven capacity for interaction, it is tempting to suppose that direct physical interaction of these proteins occurs during one or more steps of replication or repair. The most direct test of this hypothesis is to selectively abolish the ability of PCNA and FEN-1 to interact with one another, and then to determine whether loss of this function affects replication or repair efficiency. We have used this strategy to investigate the potential role of this interaction in long-patch BER. In this report, we show that the PCNA binding activity of FEN-1 is important for excision in BER, thus establishing a specific repair function for the interaction of these two proteins. The wild type human PCNA expression plasmid has been described previously (17Gary R. Ludwig D.L. Cornelius H.L. MacInnes M.A. Park M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24522-24529Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). The L126D/I128E double point mutant derivative of this plasmid was generated by site-directed mutagenesis using the QuickChange Mutagenesis protocol (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) with the high-fidelity Pfu DNA polymerase and mutagenic oligonucleotides 5′-GGATTTAGATGTTGAACAGGATGGAGAACCAGAACAG-3′ and 5′-CTGTTCTGGTTCTCCATCCTGTTCAACATCTAAATCC-3′. This primer pair created an FokI restriction site to facilitate screening. The plasmid pET-FCH to express wild type human FEN-1 with a 6-histidine C-terminal purification tag has been described (19Shen B. Nolan J.P. Sklar L.A. Park M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9173-9176Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 20Nolan J.P. Shen B. Park M.S. Sklar L.A. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 11668-11676Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 21Shen B. Nolan J.P. Sklar L.A. Park M.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3332-3338Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). This plasmid was modified by site-directed mutagenesis to create the F343A/F344A mutant FEN-1 expression plasmid by QuickChange mutagenesis using oligonucleotides 5′-GGCCGCCTGGATGATGCCGCCAAAGTGACCGGCTCACTC-3′ and 5′-GAGTGAGCCGGTCACTTTGGCGGCATCATCCAGGCGGCC-3′. This primer pair was designed to destroy a naturally occurring BstEII restriction site in order to facilitate screening. The expression constructs were verified by DNA sequencing. In both the pET-FCH wild type FEN-1 parental vector and the F343A/F344A mutant derivative, a single nucleotide disagreement with the published human FEN-1 sequence (22Hiraoka L.R. Harrington J.J. Gerhard D.S. Lieber M.R. Hsieh C.L. Genomics. 1995; 25: 220-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) was observed. Nucleotide 247 of the FEN-1 open reading frame was “C” rather than “T” as found in the originally published DNA sequence. The resultant CAT codon specifies a histidine 83 residue in both of the proteins (wild type and mutant FEN-1) used in the present study, in place of tyrosine-83 obtained by conceptual translation of the published DNA sequence. The C-247 nucleotide was present in the original plasmid prepared by direct subcloning of theNcoI-BamHI restriction fragment from amplified FEN-1 cDNA (20Nolan J.P. Shen B. Park M.S. Sklar L.A. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 11668-11676Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), raising the possibility that there may be polymorphism at this position. Supporting this possibility, histidine in place of tyrosine is a very conservative amino acid substitution; at an evolutionary distance of 2 PAM (percentage ofaccepted point mutations), only phenylalanine and tryptophan substitutions are tolerated more frequently (23Schulz G.E. Schirmer R.H. Principles of Protein Structure, Table 9-2. Springer-Verlag, New York1979: 172Google Scholar). In any case, the histidine substitution had no effect on the catalytic activity of FEN-1, based on comparison of enzymatic specific activity with tyrosine 83 wild type FEN-1 created with mutagenic oligonucleotides 5′-AACGGCATCAAGCCCGTGTACGTATTTGATGGCAAGCCGCCA-3′ and 5′-TGGCGGCTTGCCATCAAATACGTACACGGGCTTGATGCCGTT-3′ (data not shown). This primer pair created a SnaBI restriction site to facilitate screening. Escherichia coli strain BL21(DE3) cells harboring either wild type or mutant PCNA expression plasmid, wild type or mutant FEN-1 plasmid, or pET28b vector (Novagen, Madison, WI) without cDNA insert were grown to a density of approximately 0.6 absorbance units at 600 nm, then 0.8 mmisopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside was added to induce protein expression and growth was continued for an additional 3 h at 37 °C. Cells were harvested by centrifugation and cell pellets were resuspended in 50 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mmNaCl, 0.2 mg/ml lysozyme, 1 mm benzamidine, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μmpepstatin A, 10 μg/ml chymostatin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, pH 7.4, at a ratio of 1 ml/35-ml culture and briefly sonicated. The cell lysates were clarified by two cycles of centrifugation at 16,000 ×g. Binding assay mixtures consisted of 70 μl of 50% NiSO4-charged iminodiacetic acid metal chelating Sepharose resin (Pharmacia Biotech, Piscataway, NJ), 150 μl of lysate from cells expressing His6-tagged wild type or mutant FEN-1, or negative control lysate from pET28b vector-containing cells, 150 μl of lysate from cells expressing untagged wild type or mutant PCNA, and 150 μl of 50 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.4, added to increase mixing efficiency. Mixtures were incubated for 90 min at 4 °C with continuous gentle rocking, then washed six times with 0.8 ml of 50 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 60 mm imidazole, pH 7.4. Protein complexes were eluted by heating to 100 °C with 80 μl of 2 × Laemmli SDS gel sample buffer, and analyzed on 12% gels by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) and Coomassie Blue staining. His6-tagged wild type and mutant FEN-1 were purified with HisBind affinity resin (Novagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Wild type and mutant PCNA were purified by a method previously described for wild type PCNA (17Gary R. Ludwig D.L. Cornelius H.L. MacInnes M.A. Park M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24522-24529Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). AP endonuclease and the BE-1 fraction from Xenopus laevis ovaries were prepared as described previously (7Kim K. Biade S. Matsumoto Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8842-8848Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 8Matsumoto Y. Kim K. Bogenhagen D.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6187-6197Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). The BE-1 fraction contains pol δ, RF-C, and DNA ligase activities. Rat DNA polymerase β was overexpressed in bacteria and purified as described previously (4Matsumoto Y. Kim K. Science. 1995; 269: 699-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (646) Google Scholar). Stimulation of the activity of calf thymus DNA polymerase δ (a generous gift from Drs. Chen-Keat Tan and Antero G. So of the University of Miami) by PCNA proteins was measured as described previously (8Matsumoto Y. Kim K. Bogenhagen D.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6187-6197Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). Briefly, each assay contained 0.5 μg of substrate consisting of poly(dA) template and oligo(dT) primer at 5:1 molar ratio in 50 mm bis-Tris-HCl, 10 mm KCl, 6 mm MgCl2, 0.4 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 50 μm [α-32P]TTP, pH 6.5. One unit of polymerase activity corresponds to the incorporation of 1 pmol of TMP into acid-precipitable material in 30 min at 37 °C. 32P-Prelabeled covalently closed circular DNA substrates containing a synthetic AP site analog, the 3-hydroxy-2-hydroxymethyltetrahydrofuran residue, were prepared as described previously (8Matsumoto Y. Kim K. Bogenhagen D.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6187-6197Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). Among these substrates, the 5′-labeled DNA has a 32P at the position 5 nucleotides away from the lesion toward 5′ while the 3′-labeled DNA has a 32P at the position 10 nucleotides away from the lesion toward 3′. Repair assays with these DNA substrates were conducted as described previously (8Matsumoto Y. Kim K. Bogenhagen D.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6187-6197Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). Briefly, indicated proteins were incubated with either the 5′- or 3′-labeled DNA containing a 3-hydroxy-2-hydroxymethyltetrahydrofuran site for 30 min at 25 °C in the presence of 20 μmdATP, 20 μm dCTP, 20 μm dGTP, 20 μm TTP, and 2 mm ATP. In a standard reaction, 7 ng of X. laevis AP endonuclease, 10 ng of human PCNA, 10 ng of human FEN-1, and 0.4 μg of protein of the X. laevisBE-1 fraction were used. For the pol β-dependent repair reactions, 7 ng of AP endonuclease, 10 ng of FEN-1, and 50 ng of rat pol β were used. After the reaction was stopped by the addition of SDS, DNA was recovered by phenol/chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation, digested with HinfI and subjected to electrophoresis in a denaturing 20% polyacrylamide gel. Subsequently, the gel was subjected to autoradiography with an x-ray film and was quantitatively analyzed with a Fuji BAS1000 phosphorimage analyzer. The enzymatic activity of FEN-1 was assayed as described previously (20Nolan J.P. Shen B. Park M.S. Sklar L.A. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 11668-11676Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Briefly, a three-oligonucleotide 5′-flap substrate was assembled by annealing a 3′-biotinylated 31-mer template strand, a 5′-fluoresceinated 34-mer flap strand (14 nucleotides annealed and 20 nucleotides displaced), and a 16-mer upstream annealed primer strand. The 5′-fluoresceinated flap DNA was attached to streptavidin-coated microspheres, and 50–100 pm substrate was mixed with enzyme in 500 μl of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 10 mm MgCl2, 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin at room temperature. Bead-associated fluorescence was measured in real time from 0 to 500 s by flow cytometry. Three synthetic oligonucleotides were annealed to build a nicked DNA substrate for measurement of exonuclease activity. A 57-mer template strand (5′-TCGAGTTATTTAAACCATGCATCTAATGTTTTTTGCTTAGTTTTGTTTGCAAGCTTG-3′) was annealed to a perfectly complementary 36-mer primer (5′-AGCAAAAAACATTAGATGCATGGTTTAAATAACTCG-3′). The resulting duplex DNA possessed a 1-nucleotide gap at the 3′-end of the 36-mer that was used as a labeling site for incorporation of [α-32P]dATP. A 100-μl reaction containing 12 μm duplex and 10 units of Sequenase version 2.0 DNA polymerase (U. S. Biochemical, Cleveland, OH) in 25 mmHEPES, pH 7.4, 10 mm MgCl2, 2 mmdithiothreitol, 50 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 50 μmdATP, 20 μCi of [α-32P]dATP was incubated for 10 min at 37 °C to generate a 3′-end 32P-labeled 37-mer strand. The DNA polymerase was inactivated by incubation for 10 min at 70 °C, then unincorporated dATP was separated from the labeled duplex using a 0.8-ml Sephadex G-50 spin column. A 2-fold molar excess of the perfectly complementary upstream primer 20-mer (5′-CAAGCTTGCAAACAAAACTA-3′) was annealed to the labeled 37-mer/57-mer duplex to generate an internally nicked substrate with blunt ends. Exonuclease activity was assayed in a 20-μl reaction volume containing 300 nm32P-labeled DNA substrate and 0, 1, 2, or 4 μm wild type or F343A/F344A mutant FEN-1 in a buffer of 28 mm imidazole, 12.5 mm HEPES, 0.5 mm Tris-HCl, 14 mm NaCl, 5% glycerol, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 25 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, pH 7.4. Samples were incubated for 60 min at 32 °C, then reactions were terminated by the addition of 20 μl of 94% formamide, 10 mm EDTA, 0.1% xylene cyanol, 0.1% bromphenol blue and heated to 90 °C for 10 min. 15 μl of this mixture (approximately 10,000 cpm per lane) was run on a 15% polyacrylamide (19:1 acrylamide:bis-acrylamide), 7 m urea, 10 mm Tris-HCl, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, denaturing gel at 65 watts constant power for 2 h. The gel was dried and subjected to autoradiography (3 days exposure to Kodax BioMax film) or quantitated using a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). Substrate remaining was calculated as: 37-mer area intensity/total integrated area intensity divided by the mean (37-mer area intensity/total integrated area intensity) of input DNA (the no protein lanes). The crystal structure of p21 peptide complexed with human PCNA has been reported (24Gulbis J.M. Kelman Z. Hurwitz J. O'Donnell M. Kuriyan J. Cell. 1996; 87: 297-306Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (640) Google Scholar). FEN-1 interacts with PCNA by a mechanism analogous to that of p21 (16Warbrick E. Lane D.P. Glover D.M. Cox L.S. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 2313-2321Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 17Gary R. Ludwig D.L. Cornelius H.L. MacInnes M.A. Park M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24522-24529Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar), so the PCNA-p21 structural information was used to design PCNA mutants predicted to exhibit FEN-1-binding defects. A series of mutations was introduced into PCNA, and the mutant proteins were tested for their ability to bind to FEN-1. 2R. Gary and M. Park, unpublished data. The I126D/L128E double point mutant of PCNA was identified as having a particularly severe defect in FEN-1 binding activity. This mutant of PCNA was purified and characterized (Fig. 1) for use as a tool to investigate the role of the PCNA-FEN-1 interaction in long-patch BER. Bacterially expressed wild type and I126D/L128E mutant human PCNA were purified to apparent homogeneity (Fig. 1 A). The PCNA subunit migrates with an apparent molecular mass of 34 kDa on a denaturing SDS-PAGE gel, although its calculated molecular mass is 29 kDa. An affinity interaction assay was used to compare the FEN-1 binding activities of wild type and mutant PCNA. Lysates from bacteria expressing polyhistidine (His6)-tagged FEN-1 and either wild type or mutant PCNA were mixed, and nickel-charged metal chelate resin was added to capture the His6-tagged FEN-1 along with any associated PCNA. As expected, wild type PCNA bound avidly to FEN-1 (Fig. 1 B, lane 1). In contrast, the I126D/L128E mutant of PCNA displayed only a background level of nonspecific binding (Fig.1 B, lane 2), similar to that observed in negative control assays in which FEN-1 was omitted (Fig. 1 B, lanes 3 and4). Thus, the I126D/L128E mutation virtually abolished FEN-1 binding activity. Nonetheless, both wild type and mutant PCNA formed the characteristic 87-kDa homotrimeric species when analyzed by gel filtration chromatography, confirming that intersubunit interaction was unaffected by the site-directed mutagenesis. On a Sephacryl S-300 HR 16 × 600 mm column, the parameter K, which is given by: (elution volume) − (void volume)/(solvent accessible volume) and which is inversely proportional to log MW, was 0.389 for wild type PCNA and 0.384 for mutant PCNA. Bovine serum albumin, which at 66 kDa is smaller than the 87-kDa PCNA trimer but larger than the 29-kDa PCNA monomer, was used as a standard and gave a K value of 0.405. The I126D/L128E mutant of PCNA was, however, severely defective in the ability to stimulate DNA synthesis by DNA polymerase δ (Fig.1 C). Compared with wild type PCNA, the activity of the mutant in this assay was negligible. This defect is the result of an inability of the mutant PCNA to bind to DNA polymerase δ. Recently, very similar mutations have been characterized independently in yeast and human PCNA (18Eissenberg J.C. Ayyagari R. Gomes X.V. Burgers P.M.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6367-6378Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 25Zhang P. Sun Y. Hsu H. Zhang L. Zhang Y. Lee M.Y.W.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 713-719Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). In human PCNA, the L126S and I128A mutations are moderately and severely impaired, respectively, in their abilities to interact with DNA polymerase δ (25Zhang P. Sun Y. Hsu H. Zhang L. Zhang Y. Lee M.Y.W.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 713-719Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Likewise, the I126A/L128A double mutant of yeast PCNA is severely defective in physical interaction with DNA polymerase δ, and must be used at concentrations 1000-fold greater than wild type PCNA to stimulate DNA polymerase δ-mediated DNA synthesis (18Eissenberg J.C. Ayyagari R. Gomes X.V. Burgers P.M.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6367-6378Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, this mutant retains normal functional interactions with RF-C, a 5-subunit complex that loads PCNA onto the DNA primer-template junction in an ATP-dependent manner. Interestingly, the I126A/L128A yeast PCNA mutant retains binding to yeast FEN-1 (18Eissenberg J.C. Ayyagari R. Gomes X.V. Burgers P.M.J. Mol. Cell.

In contrast, the complete primary structure of NHE5 has not been determined, and nothing is known about its functional characteristics and physiological roles.The human NHE5 gene was identified several years ago by low stringency screening of a cosmid library using an NHE2 cDNA probe and mapped to chromosome 16q22.1 (7Klanke C.A. Su Y.R. Callen D.F. Wang Z. Meneton P. Baird N. Kandasamy R.A. Orlowski J. Otterud B.E. Leppert M. Shull G.E. Menon A.G. Genomics. 1995; 25: 615-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Northern blot analysis demonstrated that NHE5 transcripts were expressed at easily detected levels in brain, spleen, and testis and at trace levels in skeletal muscle and revealed differences in the sizes of the transcripts in each tissue. Unlike the other isoforms, expression of NHE5 was not observed in epithelial tissues. Based on the partial coding sequences obtained and limited analysis of the structure of the gene, NHE5 appeared to be more closely related to the amiloride-resistant NHE3 isoform than to other members of the family. Its abundant expression in brain and apparent similarity to NHE3 raised the possibility that NHE5 might be the amiloride-resistant Na+/H+ exchanger that was described in hippocampal neurons (13Raley-Susman K.M. Cragoe Jr., E.J. Sapolsky R.M. Kopito R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 2739-2745Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), particularly since NHE3 expression is negligible in brain (2Orlowski J. Kandasamy R.A. Shull G.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9331-9339Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To begin a systematic analysis of the functional characteristics and physiological roles of NHE5, we have cloned and functionally expressed a cDNA encoding the complete amino acid sequence of human NHE5, determined the intron-exon organization of its gene, and demonstrated that its mRNA is expressed in hippocampus and other structures of the brain.DISCUSSIONThe major objectives of this study were to determine the primary structure of human NHE5 and to explore the possibility that it corresponds to an amiloride-resistant Na+/H+exchanger that was identified previously in hippocampal neurons (13Raley-Susman K.M. Cragoe Jr., E.J. Sapolsky R.M. Kopito R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 2739-2745Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The human NHE5 gene was identified several years ago and was shown to be expressed in brain, spleen, and testis (7Klanke C.A. Su Y.R. Callen D.F. Wang Z. Meneton P. Baird N. Kandasamy R.A. Orlowski J. Otterud B.E. Leppert M. Shull G.E. Menon A.G. Genomics. 1995; 25: 615-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). In the present study we were unable to isolate NHE5 cDNAs corresponding to fully processed transcripts in human spleen or testis; however, PCR analysis of brain cDNA did yield products that were correctly processed. These cloning experiments and the previous observation that NHE5 transcripts in human spleen and testis are larger than those in brain suggest that intron sequences, which disrupt the open reading frame, are retained in the spleen and testis mRNAs. While this study was in progress we had frequent discussions with Attaphitaya et al. (21Attaphitaya S. Park K. Melvin J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4383-4388Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar), who were conducting similar studies of rat NHE5. When cloning rat NHE5 from brain, these investigators did not encounter processing intermediates or aberrantly spliced transcripts, and their Northern blot analyses revealed high levels of NHE5 mRNA in brain and only trace levels in spleen, testis, and other tissues. Thus, the results from both laboratories suggest that expression of functional NHE5 mRNA may be restricted to brain, although they do not rule out the possibility of expression in tissues and developmental stages that were not examined in these experiments.On the basis of the current and previous studies (7Klanke C.A. Su Y.R. Callen D.F. Wang Z. Meneton P. Baird N. Kandasamy R.A. Orlowski J. Otterud B.E. Leppert M. Shull G.E. Menon A.G.

Chem. 1996; 271: 10551-10559Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), it is apparent that NHE5 and NHE3 are more closely related to each other, in both genomic organization and amino acid sequence, than to the other isoforms. As shown in Fig. 2, the location of exon boundaries relative to the coding sequences are almost identical in the NHE5 andnhe3 genes, and only the last intron of the nhe3gene lacks a counterpart in the NHE5 gene. In contrast, introns 2, 4, and 10–15 of the NHE5 and nhe3genes have no counterparts in the NHE1 gene (14Kandasamy R.A. Orlowski J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10551-10559Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 22Miller R.T. Counillon L. Pages G. Lifton R.P. Sardet C. Pouyssegur J. J. Biol.

The complete genomic organization of the nhe2 and nhe4 genes, which are tightly linked in the mouse genome (23Pathak B.P. Shull G.E. Jenkins N.A. Copeland N.G. Genomics. 1996; 31: 261-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), have not been determined. However, limited analyses of the mouse nhe2 andnhe4 genes (7Klanke C.A. Su Y.R. Callen D.F. Wang Z.

Genomics. 1995; 25: 615-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar) indicate that they are more closely related to NHE1 than to NHE5 and nhe3, a conclusion that is supported by comparisons of amino acid sequences (Table II and see Refs. 4Wang Z.

Shull G.E. Menon A.G. Genomics. 1995; 25: 615-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar).An unusual feature of the NHE5 gene is the presence of GC dinucleotides, rather than GT dinucleotides, at the beginning of introns 13 and 14 (Table I). This departure from the consensus sequence is uncommon, but several dozen examples of GC dinucleotides at the beginning of an intron have been documented (24Jackson I.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 14: 3795-3798Crossref Scopus (278) Google Scholar). For example, the sequences, AAG/GCATGT and CAG/GCAAGC, at the donor sites of exons 13 and 14, respectively, are identical to donor sites observed in the RNA polymerase II (25Ahearn Jr., J.M. Bartolomei M.S. West M.L. Cisek L.J. Corden J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 10695-10705Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and heme oxygenase (26Muller R.M. Taguchi H. Shibahara S. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 6795-6802Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) genes, respectively.The data shown in Fig. 3 demonstrate that human NHE5 mediates H+-dependent Na+ influx and are consistent with the observation that rat NHE5 mediates Na+-dependent pH recovery from an acid load (21Attaphitaya S. Park K. Melvin J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4383-4388Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). 22Na+ influx in the clonal isolate shown in Fig. 3 was ∼0.2 pmol/min/mg protein. Under comparable assay conditions the average 22Na+ influx values for AP-1 cell isolates expressing NHE1, NHE2, and NHE3 was between 0.25 and 0.60 pmol/min/mg protein (17Orlowski J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16369-16377Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Yu F.H. Shull G.E. Orlowski J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25536-25541Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), with activity in the order NHE1 > NHE2 > NHE3. Because the amount of NHE protein expressed in each of the clonal isolates that have been examined has not been determined, the relative activities of the various isoforms cannot be directly compared; however, the activity of the NHE5 isolate examined here is within the range of values observed for clonal isolates expressing NHE3. Rat NHE5 has been shown to be more resistant than NHE1 to 5-(N-ethyl-N-isopropyl)amiloride (21Attaphitaya S. Park K. Melvin J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4383-4388Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar), and detailed pharmacological and biochemical analyses of human NHE5 that are currently in progress 2E. Szabo and J. Orlowski, unpublished observations. indicate that human NHE5 is also quite resistant to pharmacological antagonists, although not to as great an extent as NHE3. Thus, both human and rat NHE5 are, in fact, Na+/H+exchangers and have pharmacological characteristics that more closely resemble NHE3 than NHE1.When we began this study we were interested in determining whether NHE5 might be the transporter responsible for the amiloride-resistant Na+/H+ exchange activity identified in rat hippocampal neurons by Raley-Susman et al. (13Raley-Susman K.M. Cragoe Jr., E.J. Sapolsky R.M. Kopito R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 2739-2745Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Our Northern blot data showing NHE5 expression in hippocampus of human brain and in situ hybridization analysis showing NHE5 expression in rat hippocampus (21Attaphitaya S. Park K. Melvin J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4383-4388Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar) are consistent with this possibility. However, the Na+/H+ exchange activity observed in hippocampal neurons was completely insensitive to 1 mm amiloride, whereas human NHE5 expressed in AP-1 cells is fully inhibited by this concentration of amiloride (Fig. 3). This apparent difference in drug sensitivity could be due to the different conditions under which Na+/H+ exchange activity was measured in the two studies. For example, in the study of Na+/H+ exchange in hippocampal neurons (13Raley-Susman K.M. Cragoe Jr., E.J. Sapolsky R.M. Kopito R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 2739-2745Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the concentration of extracellular Na+, which is a competitive inhibitor of amiloride binding, was 135 mm, whereas in our own studies only trace levels of22Na+ were present. NHE4 has been localized to cavi amnoni neurons in rat hippocampus (27Bookstein C. Musch M.W. DePaoli A. Xie Y. Rabenau K. Villereal M. Rao M.C. Chang E.B. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: C1629-C1638Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), but this isoform also has been shown to exhibit some sensitivity to 1 mm amiloride. Additional studies will be needed to resolve the questions of which isoform(s) mediate control of intracellular pH in hippocampal neurons.In summary, we have cloned and expressed a fifth member of the plasma membrane Na+/H+ exchanger family and have obtained data indicating that functional expression of this isoform may be restricted to brain. Northern blot analysis showed that it is widely distributed in brain, with significant mRNA expression detected in hippocampus, amygdala, caudate nucleus, hypothalamus, subthalamic nucleus, and thalamus. The detection of NHE5 mRNA in multiple structures of the brain, but the absence of a significant hybridization signal in corpus callosum, which consists primarily of axons and glial cells and has few neuronal cell bodies, raises the possibility that NHE5 may be a neuron-specific isoform. If this proves to be the case, then this isoform would be the most highly cell type-specific member of the Na+/H+ exchanger family.

The human NHE5 gene was identified several years ago and was shown to be expressed in brain, spleen, and testis (7Klanke C.A. Su Y.R. Callen D.F. Wang Z. Meneton P. Baird N. Kandasamy R.A. Orlowski J. Otterud B.E. Leppert M. Shull G.E. Menon A.G. Genomics. 1995; 25: 615-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). In the present study we were unable to isolate NHE5 cDNAs corresponding to fully processed transcripts in human spleen or testis; however, PCR analysis of brain cDNA did yield products that were correctly processed. These cloning experiments and the previous observation that NHE5 transcripts in human spleen and testis are larger than those in brain suggest that intron sequences, which disrupt the open reading frame, are retained in the spleen and testis mRNAs. While this study was in progress we had frequent discussions with Attaphitaya et al. (21Attaphitaya S. Park K. Melvin J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4383-4388Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar), who were conducting similar studies of rat NHE5. When cloning rat NHE5 from brain, these investigators did not encounter processing intermediates or aberrantly spliced transcripts, and their Northern blot analyses revealed high levels of NHE5 mRNA in brain and only trace levels in spleen, testis, and other tissues. Thus, the results from both laboratories suggest that expression of functional NHE5 mRNA may be restricted to brain, although they do not rule out the possibility of expression in tissues and developmental stages that were not examined in these experiments.On the basis of the current and previous studies (7Klanke C.A. Su Y.R. Callen D.F. Wang Z. Meneton P. Baird N. Kandasamy R.A. Orlowski J. Otterud B.E. Leppert M. Shull G.E. Menon A.G.

Chem. 1996; 271: 10551-10559Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), it is apparent that NHE5 and NHE3 are more closely related to each other, in both genomic organization and amino acid sequence, than to the other isoforms. As shown in Fig. 2, the location of exon boundaries relative to the coding sequences are almost identical in the NHE5 andnhe3 genes, and only the last intron of the nhe3gene lacks a counterpart in the NHE5 gene. In contrast, introns 2, 4, and 10–15 of the NHE5 and nhe3genes have no counterparts in the NHE1 gene (14Kandasamy R.A. Orlowski J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10551-10559Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 22Miller R.T. Counillon L. Pages G. Lifton R.P. Sardet C. Pouyssegur J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 10813-10819Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and introns 8–11 of the NHE1 gene have no counterparts in theNHE5 and nhe3 genes. The complete genomic organization of the nhe2 and nhe4 genes, which are tightly linked in the mouse genome (23Pathak B.P. Shull G.E. Jenkins N.A. Copeland N.G. Genomics. 1996; 31: 261-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), have not been determined. However, limited analyses of the mouse nhe2 andnhe4 genes (7Klanke C.A. Su Y.R. Callen D.F. Wang Z. Meneton P. Baird N. Kandasamy R.A. Orlowski J. Otterud B.E. Leppert M. Shull G.E. Menon A.G. Genomics. 1995; 25: 615-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar) indicate that they are more closely related to NHE1 than to NHE5 and nhe3, a conclusion that is supported by comparisons of amino acid sequences (Table II and see Refs. 4Wang Z. Orlowski J. Shull G.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11925-11928Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 5Tse C.-M. Levine S.A. Yun C.H.C. Montrose M.H. Little P.J. Pouyssegur J. Donowitz M. J.

Shull G.E. Menon A.G. Genomics. 1995; 25: 615-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar).An unusual feature of the NHE5 gene is the presence of GC dinucleotides, rather than GT dinucleotides, at the beginning of introns 13 and 14 (Table I). This departure from the consensus sequence is uncommon, but several dozen examples of GC dinucleotides at the beginning of an intron have been documented (24Jackson I.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 14: 3795-3798Crossref Scopus (278) Google Scholar). For example, the sequences, AAG/GCATGT and CAG/GCAAGC, at the donor sites of exons 13 and 14, respectively, are identical to donor sites observed in the RNA polymerase II (25Ahearn Jr., J.M. Bartolomei M.S. West M.L. Cisek L.J. Corden J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 10695-10705Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and heme oxygenase (26Muller R.M. Taguchi H. Shibahara S. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 6795-6802Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) genes, respectively.The data shown in Fig. 3 demonstrate that human NHE5 mediates H+-dependent Na+ influx and are consistent with the observation that rat NHE5 mediates Na+-dependent pH recovery from an acid load (21Attaphitaya S. Park K. Melvin J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4383-4388Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). 22Na+ influx in the clonal isolate shown in Fig. 3 was ∼0.2 pmol/min/mg protein. Under comparable assay conditions the average 22Na+ influx values for AP-1 cell isolates expressing NHE1, NHE2, and NHE3 was between 0.25 and 0.60 pmol/min/mg protein (17Orlowski J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16369-16377Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Yu F.H. Shull G.E. Orlowski J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25536-25541Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), with activity in the order NHE1 > NHE2 > NHE3. Because the amount of NHE protein expressed in each of the clonal isolates that have been examined has not been determined, the relative activities of the various isoforms cannot be directly compared; however, the activity of the NHE5 isolate examined here is within the range of values observed for clonal isolates expressing NHE3. Rat NHE5 has been shown to be more resistant than NHE1 to 5-(N-ethyl-N-isopropyl)amiloride (21Attaphitaya S. Park K. Melvin J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4383-4388Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar), and detailed pharmacological and biochemical analyses of human NHE5 that are currently in progress 2E. Szabo and J. Orlowski, unpublished observations. indicate that human NHE5 is also quite resistant to pharmacological antagonists, although not to as great an extent as NHE3. Thus, both human and rat NHE5 are, in fact, Na+/H+exchangers and have pharmacological characteristics that more closely resemble NHE3 than NHE1.When we began this study we were interested in determining whether NHE5 might be the transporter responsible for the amiloride-resistant Na+/H+ exchange activity identified in rat hippocampal neurons by Raley-Susman et al. (13Raley-Susman K.M. Cragoe Jr., E.J. Sapolsky R.M. Kopito R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 2739-2745Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Our Northern blot data showing NHE5 expression in hippocampus of human brain and in situ hybridization analysis showing NHE5 expression in rat hippocampus (21Attaphitaya S. Park K. Melvin J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4383-4388Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar) are consistent with this possibility. However, the Na+/H+ exchange activity observed in hippocampal neurons was completely insensitive to 1 mm amiloride, whereas human NHE5 expressed in AP-1 cells is fully inhibited by this concentration of amiloride (Fig. 3). This apparent difference in drug sensitivity could be due to the different conditions under which Na+/H+ exchange activity was measured in the two studies. For example, in the study of Na+/H+ exchange in hippocampal neurons (13Raley-Susman K.M. Cragoe Jr., E.J. Sapolsky R.M. Kopito R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 2739-2745Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the concentration of extracellular Na+, which is a competitive inhibitor of amiloride binding, was 135 mm, whereas in our own studies only trace levels of22Na+ were present. NHE4 has been localized to cavi amnoni neurons in rat hippocampus (27Bookstein C. Musch M.W. DePaoli A. Xie Y. Rabenau K. Villereal M. Rao M.C. Chang E.B. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: C1629-C1638Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), but this isoform also has been shown to exhibit some sensitivity to 1 mm amiloride. Additional studies will be needed to resolve the questions of which isoform(s) mediate control of intracellular pH in hippocampal neurons.In summary, we have cloned and expressed a fifth member of the plasma membrane Na+/H+ exchanger family and have obtained data indicating that functional expression of this isoform may be restricted to brain. Northern blot analysis showed that it is widely distributed in brain, with significant mRNA expression detected in hippocampus, amygdala, caudate nucleus, hypothalamus, subthalamic nucleus, and thalamus. The detection of NHE5 mRNA in multiple structures of the brain, but the absence of a significant hybridization signal in corpus callosum, which consists primarily of axons and glial cells and has few neuronal cell bodies, raises the possibility that NHE5 may be a neuron-specific isoform. If this proves to be the case, then this isoform would be the most highly cell type-specific member of the Na+/H+ exchanger family. The major objectives of this study were to determine the primary structure of human NHE5 and to explore the possibility that it corresponds to an amiloride-resistant Na+/H+exchanger that was identified previously in hippocampal neurons (13Raley-Susman K.M.

As a member of the novel phosphatidylinositol kinase-related kinase family, FRAP's kinase activity is essential for its signaling function. The FKBP12-rapamycin binding (FRB) domain in FRAP is also speculated to play an important role in FRAP function and signaling. However, the biochemical and physiological functions of FRB, as well as the mechanism for rapamycin inhibition, have been unclear. The present study focuses on investigation of FRB's role and the functional relationship between FRB domain and kinase domain in FRAP. Microinjection of purified FRB protein into human osteosarcoma MG63 cells results in a drastic blockage of the G1 to S cell cycle progression; such a dominant negative effect is reversed by a point mutation (Trp2027 → Phe). The same mutation also abolishes kinase activity of FRAP without affecting ATP binding, and truncation studies suggest that upstream sequences including FRB are required for kinase activity in vitro. Given these data, we propose a model for FRAP function, in which the FRB domain is required for activation of the kinase domain, possibly through the interaction with an upstream activator.

FRAP belongs to the novel family of phosphatidylinositol kinase (PIK)-related kinases which includeAtaxia telangiectasia mutated. Members of this family are involved in a range of essential cellular functions, including cell cycle progression, cell cycle checkpoints, DNA repair, and DNA recombination (25Keith C.T.

A kinase domain with sequence homology to lipid and protein kinases has been found at the C termini of all members in this family, and the kinase activity is crucial for the functions of these proteins. The FRAP protein is a 289-kDa single polypeptide containing the characteristic C-terminal kinase domain, the activity of which has been shown to be toward serine/threonine residues (10Brown E.J. Beal P.A. Keith C.T. Chen J. Shin T.B. Schreiber S.L. Nature. 1995; 377: 441-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (617) Google Scholar, 14Brunn G.J. Hudson C.C. Sekulic A. Williams J.M. Hosoi H. Houghton P.J.

Nature. 1995; 377: 441-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (617) Google Scholar, 14Brunn G.J. Hudson C.C. Sekulic A. Williams J.M. Hosoi H. Houghton P.J. Lawrence Jr., J.C. Abraham R.T.

However, it is currently unclear how FRAP receives upstream signals and transduces them to the downstream components. Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and protein kinase B/Akt have been implicated to relay extracellular mitogenic stimuli to FRAP (32Gingras A.C. Kennedy S.G. O'Leary M.A. Sonenberg N. Hay N. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 502-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (725) Google Scholar,33Scott P.H. Brunn G.J. Kohn A.D. Roth R.A. Lawrence Jr., J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7772-7777Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar), whereas evidence has also been presented to suggest that FRAP may regulate a nutrient (amino acid)-responsive pathway that is a prerequisite, but not an overlap, of the mitogenic pathway (34Hara K. Yonezawa K. Weng Q.-P. Kozlowski M.T. Belham C. Avruch J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14484-14494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1112) Google Scholar). Further investigation is required to reconcile these observations.In vitro phosphorylations of both p70s6k and 4E-BP1 by FRAP have been reported (14Brunn G.J. Hudson C.C. Sekulic A. Williams J.M. Hosoi H. Houghton P.J. Lawrence Jr., J.C. Abraham R.T. Science. 1997; 277: 99-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (804) Google Scholar, 30Burnett P.E. Barrow R.K. Cohen N.A. Snyder S.H. Sabatini D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 1432-1437Crossref PubMed Scopus (929) Google Scholar); however, definitive evidence is still needed to demonstrate which protein (if either) is the physiological substrate for FRAP. The FKBP12-rapamycin binding (FRB) domain in FRAP has been identified as an 11-kDa segment located N-terminal to the kinase domain (35Chen J. Zheng X.F. Brown E.J. Schreiber S.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4947-4951Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar, 36Chiu M.I. Katz H. Berlin V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12574-12578Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). A serine residue, Ser2035, within this domain is crucial for the interaction between FRAP and FKBP12-rapamycin; substitutions at this site with any residues that have larger side chains than serine abolish formation of the ternary complex (35Chen J. Zheng X.F. Brown E.J. Schreiber S.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4947-4951Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar). Consistently, full-length FRAP bearing these mutations displays rapamycin resistance in Jurkat cells (10Brown E.J. Beal P.A. Keith C.T. Chen J. Shin T.B. Schreiber S.L. Nature. 1995; 377: 441-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (617) Google Scholar). Similarly, in the yeast homologues of FRAP, TOR1 and TOR2, mutations at an equivalent serine residue were found by genetic analysis to confer rapamycin resistance (37Cafferkey R. Young P.R. McLaughlin M.M. Bergsma D.J. Koltin Y. Sathe G.M. Faucette L. Eng W.K. Johnson R.K. Livi G.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 6012-6023Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar, 38Helliwell S.B.

Schreiber S.L. Cell. 1995; 82: 121-130Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). Crystal structure of the FRB domain indicates a well defined four-helical bundle with its N and C termini close together (40Choi J. Chen J. Schreiber S.L. Clardy J. Science. 1996; 273: 239-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (710) Google Scholar), implying a potential role as a functional module. The biochemical function of FRB and the mechanism for rapamycin-inhibition of FRAP are currently unclear. Although it has been a common speculation that rapamycin may inhibit the kinase activity of FRAP, micromolar concentrations of rapamycin required to inhibit FRAP activity in vitro (10Brown E.J. Beal P.A. Keith C.T. Chen J. Shin T.B. Schreiber S.L. Nature. 1995; 377: 441-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (617) Google Scholar, 14Brunn G.J. Hudson C.C. Sekulic A. Williams J.M. Hosoi H. Houghton P.J.

A. 1998; 95: 7772-7777Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar) still need to be reconciled with the low IC50 observed in vivo(subnanomolar) and the high affinity of FKBP12-rapamycin-FRAP binding (35Chen J. Zheng X.F. Brown E.J. Schreiber S.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4947-4951Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar). Only 15–50% activity of FRAP toward p70s6k and 4E-BP1 in vitro was inhibited by nanomolar concentrations of rapamycin (30Burnett P.E. Barrow R.K. Cohen N.A. Snyder S.H. Sabatini D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 1432-1437Crossref PubMed Scopus (929) Google Scholar). In addition, FRAP bound to rapamycin-FKBP12 is found to retain a robust autokinase activity (41Brunn G.J. Williams J. Sabers C. Wiederrecht G. Lawrence Jr., J.C. Abraham R.T. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5256-5267Crossref PubMed Scopus (620) Google Scholar). The absence of FRB domain in other PIK-related kinases also seems to imply that this domain is probably not required for the intrinsic catalytic activity of the kinase. To understand FRAP function and the mechanism for rapamycin inhibition of its pathway, we have probed the physiological function of FRBin vivo and examined the functional relationship between FRB and the kinase domain in FRAP. Here we report experimental evidence suggesting that the kinase activity of FRAP requires a functional FRB, which may provide a binding site for an upstream activator; this putative function of FRB is necessary for G1 progression in mammalian cells. Both human osteosarcoma MG63 cells and human embryonic kidney 293 cells were maintained in DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and penicillin/streptomycin at 37 °C with 5% CO2. Escherichia coli strain BL21 (F−, ompT,hsdSB(rB−mB+),dcm, gal) was used for expression and isolation of GST-FRB wild-type and mutant proteins. To express FRB as GST fusions, the cDNA encoding FRB from amino acid 2015 to 2114 was inserted into the vector pGEX-2T (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Point mutations of FRB were introduced by PCR using primers carrying the desired mutations: the Tyr2105 → Ala and Trp2027 → Phe mutations were introduced through the 3′ and 5′ primers, respectively. The Ser2035 → Ile mutant has been described previously (35Chen J. Zheng X.F. Brown E.J. Schreiber S.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4947-4951Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar). Full-length FRAP cDNAs containing Ser2035 → Thr and Asp2357 → Glu mutations were isolated from corresponding pBJ5 constructs (10Brown E.J. Beal P.A. Keith C.T. Chen J. Shin T.B. Schreiber S.L. Nature. 1995; 377: 441-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (617) Google Scholar) and inserted into the pCDNA3 vector via NotI sites. To construct full-length FRAP cDNA with Trp2027 → Phe, the 5′ end 5.9-kilobase pair sequence was first removed byKpnI digest; the mutation was then introduced into the 3′ 1755-base pair fragment via ApaI and PflMI sites, followed by re-insertion of the 5′ KpnI fragment. FRAP N-terminal truncation mutants 1362C, 1967C, and 2061C were constructed by deleting FRAP sequences 5′ of EcoRI, KpnI, andApaI site, respectively. FRAP 1819C fragment was generated by PCR. pGEX-4E-BP1 construct was a generous gift from Dr. Nahum Sonenberg's laboratory at McGill University. The expressions of GST-FRB wild-type and mutant proteins were induced in BL21 at room temperature to ensure solubility, whereas GST-FKBP12 and GST-4E-BP1 fusion proteins were induced at 37 °C. Purification and thrombin cleavage of the fusion proteins were carried out following standard procedures (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). After cleavage and removal of most GST proteins by glutathione-Sepharose, the FRB proteins were further purified using a Sephacryl S-100 column (2.5 cm × 100 cm). The entire procedure was performed in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) buffer containing 1 mm DTT. The purified FRB proteins were concentrated to 4.5–6 mg/ml, and SDS-PAGE analysis indicated homogeneity of at least 98%. To assess FKBP12-rapamycin binding capacity of the FRB mutants, GST-FKBP12 and rapamycin were pre-mixed in 1 ml of binding buffer (PBS with 1 mm DTT and 0.3% Triton X-100) at 1 μm each, followed by addition of 1 μm FRB protein and brief incubation on ice. Glutathione-Sepharose (20 μl) was then added to the mixture and rocked at 4 °C for 1 h. The matrix was subsequently washed three times in 1 ml of binding buffer and boiled in SDS sample buffer and loaded on a 15% SDS gel. MG63 cells were plated onto coverslips at ∼30% confluence and starved in serum-free medium for 48 h. The starved cells were microinjected with various proteins at 4.5–5 mg/ml in PBS containing 1 mm DTT and 1 mg/ml fluorescein-conjugated dextran (M r 70,000; Molecular Probes). At least 100 cells were injected each time. Upon completion of injection, the coverslips were transferred to DMEM containing 10% FBS and incubated at 37 °C in 5% CO2for 25 h before staining. Two to 12 h prior to fixation, bromodeoxyuridine (BrdUrd) was added to the media to a final concentration of 1 μm. The injected cells were fixed in 3.7% formaldehyde for 15 min, followed by permeabilization in 0.1% Triton X-100 for 10 min and incubation in 4 n HCl for 10 min. The cells were then incubated with a monoclonal anti-BrdUrd antibody (Sigma) for 30 min and subsequently with a rhodamine-conjugated anti-mouse IgG antibody (Jackson Immunoresearch). HEK293 cells were seeded onto 60-mm plates (1 × 106 cells/plate) 12–16 h prior to transfection. Six microliters of SuperFect reagent (Qiagen) was used to transfect 2 μg of DNA for each plate. At 24 h after transfection, the cells were lysed in lysis buffer (20 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.2, 1 mm Na3VO4, 25 mm NaF, 25 mm β-glycerophosphate, 2 mm EDTA, 2 mm EGTA, 0.3% Triton X-100, 1 mm DTT, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), immunoprecipitated using M2 FLAG affinity gel (Sigma). The immune complexes were washed three times with lysis buffer, two times with lysis buffer containing 0.5m NaCl, and once with kinase buffer (40 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 20% glycerol, 0.1% Triton X-100, 10 mm MnSO4, 1 mm DTT), followed by addition of 20 μl of kinase reaction mixture containing 100 μm ATP, 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP, and 2 μg of GST-4E-BP1 in the kinase buffer. The reaction was carried out at 30 °C with rocking for 15 min and stopped by addition of 20 μl of 2× SDS sample buffer. Samples were heated briefly before loaded on SDS-PAGE for autoradiography and Western analysis. To assess ATP binding activity of FRAP, transfection and cell lysis were carried out as above, followed by addition of ATP-agarose (C8-linked; Sigma) and rocking at 4 °C for 2 h. The matrix was then washed with lysis buffer, eluted with SDS sample buffer, and analyzed by Western blotting. To examine the primary structure requirement for FRAP kinase activity, we have generated a series of N-terminal deletion mutants of FRAP (Fig. 1 A). These truncated mutant proteins were transiently expressed in HEK293 cells, immunoprecipitated, and assayed for their autophosphorylation activities. Surprisingly, a fragment (1362C) much larger than the predicted kinase domain was required for such activity (Fig.1 B). This fragment includes the FRB domain and a stretch of upstream sequences in addition to the C-terminal kinase domain. The kinase domain alone (2061C) was inactive, and so were the fragments containing both the kinase and FRB domains without additional upstream sequences (1819C and 1967C) (Fig. 1 B). It was conceivable that the loss of autophosphorylation might be due to deletion of the autophosphorylation site(s). The autophosphorylation site is currently unknown. However, a loss of 4E-BP1 phosphorylation (data not shown) was observed simultaneously with the loss of autophosphorylation, suggesting that the catalytic activity was abolished in these deletion mutants. Although we cannot rule out the possibility of protein misfolding in these mutants, at least 1819C was still able to bind FKBP12-rapamycin (data not shown). These observations implicate potential involvement of FRB and/or upstream sequences in regulation of the FRAP catalytic activity. Given the obvious significance of FRB domain in FRAP's signaling function as indicated by rapamycin effect, and considering the implications of the kinase activity data, we decided to investigate the function of FRB with a more direct approach. Taking advantage of the large quantities of soluble FRB protein purified from E. coli (35Chen J. Zheng X.F. Brown E.J. Schreiber S.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4947-4951Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar), we examined the effect of introducing excess exogenous FRB into cultured cells by microinjection. Human osteosarcoma MG63 cell line has been chosen for these experiments because of the previously demonstrated rapamycin effect and well characterized cell cycle in this cell line (42Albers M.W. Williams R.T. Brown E.J. Tanaka A. Hall F.L. Schreiber S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22825-22829Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cells synchronized at G0 by serum starvation re-entered the cell cycle upon serum stimulation and completed S phase (DNA synthesis) in 25 h (data not shown). As shown in Fig. 2, cells microinjected with 4.5 mg/ml FRB protein no longer entered S phase, as indicated by the lack of DNA synthesis. This effect was apparently not an artifact of high protein concentrations injected and was specific to the FRB protein, as injection of a nonspecific protein (rabbit IgG) at the same concentration or the indicator fluorescein-dextran alone had no effect on the cell cycle (Fig. 2). The statistical significance of the FRB effect is indicated by data summarized in TableI; more than 80% of FRB injected cells were arrested at G1. The effect of FRB was concentration-dependent; injection of the protein at less than 4 mg/ml concentrations arrested a lower percentage of cells (data not shown). Due to the variation in injection flow rate, injected cells received various amounts of protein even when a constant concentration (4.5 mg/ml) of FRB was used. Normal cell cycle progression was almost always observed in cells with lower amounts of injected protein (as indicated by the fluorescence intensity), again suggesting a concentration dependence.Table IStatistical data of cell cycle progression upon microinjection of wild-type and mutant FRB proteinsProtein injectedPercentage of cells in S phase%No injection∼97Dextran91.0 ± 3.6IgG88.7 ± 6.1Wild-type FRB16.2 ± 7.2Ser2035 → Ile FRB22.4 ± 5.0Tyr2105 → Ala FRB18.8 ± 6.0Trp2027 → Phe FRB86.1 ± 9.7Microinjections of synchronized MG63 cells were carried out as described under “Experimental Procedures” and in legends to Figs. 2and 4. Three to eight independent experiments were carried out for each injection condition, and 50–200 cells were successfully injected in each experiment. All injected cells were scored for S phase entry by BrdUrd incorporation, and data are presented as the percentage of injected cells in S phase. On average, about 97% cells without injection are in S phase under the same growth conditions.

Three to eight independent experiments were carried out for each injection condition, and 50–200 cells were successfully injected in each experiment. All injected cells were scored for S phase entry by BrdUrd incorporation, and data are presented as the percentage of injected cells in S phase. On average, about 97% cells without injection are in S phase under the same growth conditions. These observations imply that the free FRB protein acts as a dominant negative factor that inhibits FRAP's normal function, which is presumably essential for G1 progression. Assuming the observed FRB effect is specific, one simple explanation is that this domain in FRAP functions as a binding site for either an upstream activator or a downstream effector; an excess of free FRB titrates off this factor and therefore inhibits FRAP signaling. To confirm the specificity of the FRB effect as well as to characterize the structure-function relationship in FRB, we set out to construct and examine the following FRB mutants. Serine 2035 in FRB has been shown to be crucial for rapamycin binding; all mutations at this site containing larger side chains abolish the formation of FKBP12-rapamycin-FRB complex (35Chen J. Zheng X.F. Brown E.J. Schreiber S.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4947-4951Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar). It is obviously of great interest to study the cell cycle effect of FRB mutated at Ser2035. However, given that full-length FRAP carrying Ser2035 mutations can signal to p70s6k and 4E-BP1 normally (10Brown E.J. Beal P.A. Keith C.T. Chen J. Shin T.B. Schreiber S.L.

Using the crystal structure of FKBP12-rapamycin-FRB ternary complex (40Choi J. Chen J. Schreiber S.L. Clardy J. Science. 1996; 273: 239-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (710) Google Scholar) as a guide, we designed two other mutants of FRB (Fig.3 A) that could potentially interfere with the presumed effector/activator binding. Tyrosine 2105 is located at the interface between FRB and FKBP12 in the complex and forms interactions with both rapamycin and FKBP12 (40Choi J. Chen J. Schreiber S.L. Clardy J. Science. 1996; 273: 239-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (710) Google Scholar); mutation at this residue may disrupt FRB's normal function if the putative effector binding is molecularly similar to FKBP12-rapamycin binding. Another site under consideration was tryptophan 2027; a Trp2027 → Arg mutant FRAP was found unable to bind rapamycin-FKBP12."
https://openalex.org/W2163893998,"Participation of the actin cytoskeleton in the transduction of proliferative signals has been established through the use of compounds that disrupt the cytoskeleton. To address the possibility that actin also participates in the transduction of an apoptotic signal, we have studied the response of the murine interleukin 2 (IL-2)-dependent T cell line CTLL-20 to treatment with the actin-binding compound jasplakinolide upon IL-2 deprivation. Like phalloidin, jasplakinolide stabilizes F-actin and promotes actin polymerization. Treatment of CTLL-20 cells with jasplakinolide, in the presence or absence of recombinant human IL-2, altered actin morphology as assessed by confocal fluorescence microscopy. Jasplakinolide was not toxic to CTLL-20 cells, nor was apoptosis induced in the presence of exogenous recombinant human IL-2. However, actin stabilization at the time of IL-2 deprivation enhanced apoptosis by changing the time at which CTLL-20 cells committed to the apoptotic pathway. This effect of jasplakinolide correlated with its ability to stabilize polymerized actin, as treatment with a synthetic analog of jasplakinolide with a greatly reduced ability to bind actin, jasplakinolide B, did not enhance apoptosis. The enhancement occurred upstream of the induction of caspase-3-like activity and could be inhibited by the overexpression of the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-xL. These data suggest that the actin cytoskeleton plays an active role in modulating lymphocyte apoptosis induced by cytokine deprivation.

Treatment of CTLL-20 cells with jasplakinolide, in the presence or absence of recombinant human IL-2, altered actin morphology as assessed by confocal fluorescence microscopy. Jasplakinolide was not toxic to CTLL-20 cells, nor was apoptosis induced in the presence of exogenous recombinant human IL-2. However, actin stabilization at the time of IL-2 deprivation enhanced apoptosis by changing the time at which CTLL-20 cells committed to the apoptotic pathway. This effect of jasplakinolide correlated with its ability to stabilize polymerized actin, as treatment with a synthetic analog of jasplakinolide with a greatly reduced ability to bind actin, jasplakinolide B, did not enhance apoptosis. The enhancement occurred upstream of the induction of caspase-3-like activity and could be inhibited by the overexpression of the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-xL. These data suggest that the actin cytoskeleton plays an active role in modulating lymphocyte apoptosis induced by cytokine deprivation. The actin cytoskeleton appears to be intricately involved in lymphocyte signal transduction (1Parsey M.V. Lewis G.K. J. Immunol. 1993; 151: 1881-1893PubMed Google Scholar, 2Rozdzial M.M. Malissen B. Finkel T.H. Immunity. 1995; 3: 623-633Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). It has long been recognized that control of the actin cytoskeleton must be coordinated with control of cell cycle events (3Vojtek A. Haarer B. Field J. Gerst J. Pollard T.D. Brown S. Wigler M. Cell. 1991; 66: 497-505Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar) and that actin-related events, such as adhesion, receptor clustering, and receptor internalization, can affect mitogenic signals (4Brock M.A. Chrest F. J. Cell. Physiol. 1993; 157: 367-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 5Caplan S. Zeliger S. Wang L. Baniyash M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Med. 1995; 181: 577-584Crossref PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar). However, the role of the actin cytoskeleton in transduction of intracellular signals leading to apoptosis in lymphocytes remains poorly defined. Apoptosis is a regulated process by which a cell undergoes a form of cell death characterized by cell shrinkage, membrane blebbing, DNA cleavage, and nuclear condensation (7Wyllie A.H. Kerr J.F. Currie A.R. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1980; 68: 251-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (6714) Google Scholar, 8Kerr J.F.R. Winterford C.M. Harmon B.V. Cancer. 1994; 73: 2013-2026Crossref PubMed Scopus (2157) Google Scholar). Elucidation of apoptotic signal transduction pathways has focused largely upon members of the Bcl family and upon the activation of caspases; the mechanisms by which cellular damage results in the changes in mitochondrial membrane potential thought to be required to initiate apoptosis are relatively unexplored. There is compelling evidence to suggest that the disruption of actin-based, integrin-mediated adhesion events is sufficient to trigger apoptosis in endothelial and epithelial cell lines (reviewed in Ref.9Frisch S.M. Ruoslahti E. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 701-706Crossref PubMed Scopus (983) Google Scholar). However, in a model of lymphocyte apoptosis, suspension cells can be used to segregate the role of the actin cytoskeleton in apoptotic signal transduction from actin-dependent, integrin-mediated survival signals. To study the possibility that the actin cytoskeleton is involved in the transduction of an apoptotic signal triggered by growth factor deprivation, we treated the nonadherent, IL-2 1The abbreviations used are: IL, interleukin; rhIL-2, recombinant human IL-2; cRPMI-10%, complete RPMI-10%; TUNEL, terminal deoxynucleotide transferase-mediated nick end labeling; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate.1The abbreviations used are: IL, interleukin; rhIL-2, recombinant human IL-2; cRPMI-10%, complete RPMI-10%; TUNEL, terminal deoxynucleotide transferase-mediated nick end labeling; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate.-dependent T cell line CTLL-20 with the novel actin-binding cyclodepsipeptide jasplakinolide upon withdrawal from IL-2. Similar to phalloidin, jasplakinolide binds to and stabilizes actin microfilaments and can promote actin polymerization in vitro (10Bubb M.R. Senderowicz A.M.J. Sausville E.A. Duncan K.L.K. Korn E.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14869-14871Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Jasplakinolide differs from phalloidin, however, in that it is permeant across cell membranes and can therefore be easily used in vivo (10Bubb M.R. Senderowicz A.M.J. Sausville E.A. Duncan K.L.K. Korn E.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14869-14871Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Previous studies reported that jasplakinolide inhibited the growth of prostate carcinoma cell lines in vitro (11Senderowicz A.M.J. Kaur G. Sainz E. Laing C. Inman W.D. Rodriguez J. Cres P. Malspeis L. Grever M.R. Sausville E.A. Duncan K.L.K. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1995; 87: 46-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar), sensitized Lewis lung carcinoma to radiation in vivo (12Takeuchi H. Ara G. Sausville E.A. Teicher B. Cancer Chemother. Pharmacol. 1998; 42: 491-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), and prevented the self-renewal of acute myeloid leukemia cells (13Fabian I. Shur I. Bleiberg I. Rudi A. Kashman Y. Lishner M. Exp. Hematol. 1995; 23: 583-587PubMed Google Scholar). In each of these reports, the effects of jasplakinolide were associated with its ability to stabilize F-actin. None of these studies, however, addressed whether the inhibition of growth or sensitization was secondary to induction or enhancement of apoptosis. We report that the addition of the actin-stabilizing compound jasplakinolide to CTLL-20 cells enhanced apoptosis induced by IL-2 cytokine deprivation. Jasplakinolide was not toxic to cells, nor was apoptosis induced in the presence of recombinant human IL-2 (rhIL-2). The enhancement of apoptosis was time- and concentration-dependent, occurred upstream of caspase activation, and could be attenuated by the overexpression of the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-xL. Furthermore, actin stabilization accelerated the time at which CTLL-20 cells committed to the apoptotic program. Taken together, these data suggest that modification of the actin cytoskeleton impacts upon signal transduction leading to apoptosis. Jasplakinolide and its analog jasplakinolide B were provided by the Drug Synthesis and Chemistry Branch, Developmental Therapeutics Program, Division of Cancer Treatment, NCI, National Institutes of Health (Bethesda, MD). Jasplakinolide and jasplakinolide B were stored in Me2SO at −20 or −80 °C and diluted into media immediately prior to use. rhIL-2 was kindly provided by Hoffman-LaRoche (Nutley, NJ). The IL-2-dependent murine cell line CTLL-20 (14Gillis S. Smith K.A. Nature. 1977; 268: 154-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (1121) Google Scholar) was grown in RPMI 1640 medium (MediaTech, Herndon, VA) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (Sigma), 10 mm HEPES (Sigma), 2 mml-glutamine (MediaTech), 100 units/ml penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (MediaTech), and 50 μm2-mercaptoethanol (Sigma) (termed complete RPMI-10% (cRPMI-10%)) to which had been added 1–2% IL-2-containing supernatant derived from concanavalin A-stimulated rat splenocytes. Forty-eight hours prior to an experiment, CTLL-20 cells were expanded in cRPMI-10% supplemented with 100 units/ml rhIL-2. A CTLL-2 clone transfected with pSFFVNeo-bcl-x L and consequently overexpressing the Bcl-xL protein (Bcl-xL-CTLL-2) was kindly provided by Dr. Craig Thompson (University of Chicago, Chicago, IL) (15Boise L.H. McShan C.L. Thompson C.B. J. Immunol. Methods. 1996; 191: 143-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Overexpression of the Bcl-xL protein was confirmed by Western blot analysis (data not shown). Bcl-xL-CTLL-2 cells were grown in cRPMI-10% supplemented with 100 units/ml rhIL-2. All cell lines were free of mycoplasma as determined monthly by polymerase chain reaction analysis (Mycoplasma PCR Primer Set, Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). For all apoptosis assays, CTLL-20 cells were washed three times in cRPMI-10% and resuspended at a final density of 2 × 105 cells/ml in cRPMI-10% without rhIL-2 to which either drug or vehicle had been added. Washed cells resuspended in cRPMI-10% with rhIL-2 (100 units/ml) served as controls. The final concentration of Me2SO in all treatment groups ranged from 0.02 to 0.1%, as indicated. Cells (1 × 106/sample) treated as indicated were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and cytospun (Cytospin 3 cell preparation system, Shandon Scientific Ltd., Cheshire, United Kingdom) onto glass slides. Cells were incubated with 50 μm NH4Cl for 5 min, permeabilized with a solution of 0.1% Triton X-100 in phosphate-buffered saline for 2.5 min, and blocked with a 2% solution of bovine serum albumin. Cells were then incubated with 30 μg/ml anti-actin monoclonal antibody N350 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for 30 to 45 min at room temperature. Cells were washed three times and incubated with 15 μg/ml Texas Red-conjugated anti-mouse IgM antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA) for 30 min at room temperature. All cells were stained with 1 μg/ml Hoechst 33258. Cytospun samples were mounted in a 0.1% (w/v) solution of phenylenediamine in 90% glycerol. Slides were viewed by confocal fluorescence microscopy (model TCS4D/DMIRBE, Leica Inc., Deerfield, IL) equipped with argon and argon-krypton lasers for UV (351–364 nm) and red (568 nm) excitation. Cells were fixed and stained as described (16Meikrantz W. Gisselbrecht S. Tam S.W. Schlegel R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 3754-3758Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). In brief, cells (2 × 105/sample) were fixed in an excess volume of 3:1 (v/v) methanol/acetic acid, dried onto glass slides, and stained with a 1 μg/ml Hoechst 33258 (Sigma) solution in double distilled H2O blocked with nonfat dried milk. In one set of experiments, a 20 or 50 μg/ml solution of propidium iodide (Sigma) with 0.5 μg/ml RNase (Boehringer Mannheim) also blocked with nonfat dried milk was used instead of Hoechst as a nuclear stain. The percentage of cells undergoing apoptosis was determined by quantifying the number of cells with and without condensed nuclei by fluorescence microscopy (Zeiss Axioskop MC100; Carl Zeiss, Thornwood, NY, or Olympus Bmax BX50, Olympus America, Melville, NY). Between 300 and 700 cells were counted for each sample. The 95% confidence interval for each sample within each experiment was determined according to the statistical definition of the variance of a proportion in a binomial experiment (17Walpole R.E. Myers R.H. Probability and Statistics for Engineers and Scientists. Fourth Ed. MacMillan Publishing Co., New York1989: 257-261Google Scholar). The variance was computed as pq/n, wherep = the proportion apoptotic, q = 1 − p, and n = the number of cells counted. For the dose-response curve of jasplakinolide, the results of three experiments were averaged and the data plotted as the mean ± S.D. The IC50 was determined by logit analysis. Terminal deoxynucleotide transferase-mediated nick end labeling (TUNEL) was performed with the Oncor (Gaithersburg, MD) ApopTag Plus kit according to the manufacturer's instructions with modifications. Briefly, 2–4 × 106 cells/sample were fixed in 1% paraformaldehyde (in phosphate-buffered saline) for 90 min. Cells were then permeabilized with a buffer containing 0.1% (w/v) saponin and 1% FCS in phosphate-buffered saline for 2 min. Following permeabilization, cells were washed once with the ApopTag equilibration buffer, then incubated with the TdT enzyme and digoxigenin-tagged dUTP at 37 °C for 30 min. Cells were washed once with the ApopTag stop/wash buffer and then incubated with the fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated anti-digoxigenin antibody for 30 min. Cells were washed once with phosphate-buffered saline. Fluorescence of each sample was measured by flow cytometry (FACScan; Becton Dickinson). The fluorescence of FITC was measured at a wavelength of 535 nm and the data analyzed using CellQuest. Data were gated based on forward and side scatter to exclude cell debris; M1 regions of FITC-bright cells (and therefore considered apoptotic) were selected for each histogram based on the background levels of staining within each sample. The activity of caspase-3 in whole cell lysates (2 × 106cells/sample) was determined using the CLONTECH(Palo Alto, CA) ApoAlert CPP32 Colorimetric Assay kit according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, cells treated and incubated as indicated were lysed in the kit lysis buffer and frozen at −80 °C until use. Lysates were thawed on ice and centrifuged (14,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C) to remove debris. Supernatants were incubated with the caspase-3 substrate (the peptide DEVD conjugated to the chromophorep-nitroanilide) for 2 h at 37 °C. The absorbance of each sample was measured at 405 nm using a 96 well colorimetric plate reader (model 3550-UV; Bio-Rad). It has previously been shown that jasplakinolide enhances actin polymerization and alters the cellular actin cytoskeleton (10Bubb M.R. Senderowicz A.M.J. Sausville E.A. Duncan K.L.K. Korn E.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14869-14871Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Senderowicz A.M.J. Kaur G. Sainz E. Laing C. Inman W.D. Rodriguez J. Cres P. Malspeis L. Grever M.R. Sausville E.A. Duncan K.L.K. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1995; 87: 46-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). To confirm that jasplakinolide altered the actin cytoskeleton in CTLL-20 cells, cells were treated with jasplakinolide (100 nm) or Me2SO (0.02%) for 8 h in the absence of IL-2. Cytospin preparations were stained by indirect immunofluorescence using an anti-actin monoclonal antibody and with Hoechst 33258 to assess nuclear morphology and analyzed by confocal fluorescence microscopy. Jasplakinolide caused both cell shape change and a redistribution of the actin cytoskeleton (Fig.1). CTLL-20 cells were observed to be typically smooth and round with an even peripheral distribution of actin. Treatment with jasplakinolide induced protrusions of the cell surface and resulted in a patchy appearance of cortical actin. In some cells treated with jasplakinolide, cortical actin appeared only around the nucleus (Fig. 1). The change in actin cytoskeletal distribution was not a result of the apoptotic process, as it occurred prior to commitment to apoptosis (see below), prior to the appearance of condensed or apoptotic nuclei (Fig. 1), and in the presence of rhIL-2 when few, if any, cells were entering or undergoing apoptosis (data not shown). Previous reports have suggested that the actin cytoskeleton may play a role in transducing proliferative signals in lymphocytes (see, e.g.Refs. 18Phatak P.D. Packman C.H. J. Cell. Physiol. 1994; 159: 365-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 19Gomez J. de Aragon A.M. Bonay P. Pitton C. Garcia A. Sliva A. Fresno M. Alvarez F. Rebollo A. Eur. J. Immunol. 1995; 25: 2673-2678Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 20Gomez J. Garcia A. Borlado L.R. Bonay P. Martinez-A C. Silva A. Fresno M. Carrera A.C. Eicher-Streiber C. Rebollo A. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 1516-1522PubMed Google Scholar). To determine whether actin might also be involved in transducing an apoptotic signal, CTLL-20 cells were incubated in the presence or absence of rhIL-2 with jasplakinolide or with vehicle, Me2SO. Additionally, cells were also treated with jasplakinolide B (Fig. 2 A, inset), an analog of jasplakinolide that has been reported to lack actin-modulating activity (11Senderowicz A.M.J. Kaur G. Sainz E. Laing C. Inman W.D. Rodriguez J. Cres P. Malspeis L. Grever M.R. Sausville E.A. Duncan K.L.K. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1995; 87: 46-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar); at a concentration of 1 μm, jasplakinolide B had no demonstrable effect on cell shape or actin redistribution in CTLL-20 cells (data not shown). Cells were harvested after 12 h of incubation with drug, and the percentage of apoptotic cells was quantified by nuclear morphology (Fig. 2 A). The number of cells with condensed nuclei after IL-2 deprivation (27%) increased 2-fold (56%) after the addition of jasplakinolide at a concentration of 100 nm. At the concentrations used, jasplakinolide was not toxic to cells, as the percentages of apoptotic CTLL-20 cells incubated with rhIL-2 were similar in the absence (1.1%) and presence (2.6%) of drug,a difference that was not statistically significant. Furthermore, the effect of jasplakinolide on apoptosis was dependent upon its ability to bind actin, as the non-actin binding analog jasplakinolide B did not show a similar effect, even at a 10-fold higher concentration (Fig.2 A). In addition, 100 nm jasplakinolide also enhanced apoptosis of the pre-B, IL-3-dependent Ba/F3 cell line in response to IL-3 deprivation (data not shown), demonstrating that the effect of drug on apoptosis was not specific to the CTLL-20 cell line nor to dependence on IL-2. TUNEL staining and subsequent flow cytometry confirmed the results obtained with Hoechst staining (Fig. 2 B). The TUNEL assay labels the 3′ hydroxyl ends of DNA remaining after cleavage by endonucleases (21Allen R.T. Hunter W.J.I. Agrawal D.K. J. Pharmacol. Toxicol. Methods. 1997; 37: 215-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar); thus, cells that are stained FITC-bright are considered apoptotic. In the experiment shown (Fig. 2 B), the percentage of FITC-bright cells in the jasplakinolide-treated population (∼70%) was greater than that in the Me2SO-treated population (∼40%) after 15 h of IL-2 deprivation. Again, treatment with jasplakinolide did not cause cell death in the presence of rhIL-2, confirming that jasplakinolide is not nonspecifically toxic to the cells. Both DNA content analysis by propidium iodide staining followed by flow cytometry and DNA fragmentation analysis by agarose gel electrophoresis confirmed that jasplakinolide enhanced apoptosis upon IL-2 deprivation (data not shown); polymerization of actin thus appeared to affect either the apoptotic signal or the apoptotic process. Treatment with jasplakinolide accelerated the appearance of apoptotic cells (Fig.3 A) after withdrawal of IL-2, although the total proportion of cells (90–95%, Fig. 3 Aand data not shown) that eventually completed apoptosis remained unchanged. Condensed nuclear morphology indicative of apoptosis was not observed in the Me2SO-treated cell population until 12 h after deprivation of IL-2, and most cells had undergone apoptosis by 24 h (Fig. 3 A), consistent with time courses previously reported (22Duke R.C. Cohen J.J. Lymphokine Res. 1986; 5: 289-299PubMed Google Scholar, 23Lu Y. Tremblay R. Jouishomme H. Chakravarthy B. Durkin J.P. J. Immunol. 1994; 153: 1495-1504PubMed Google Scholar). Stabilization of actin accelerated the apoptotic process: cells treated with jasplakinolide, unlike Me2SO-treated cells, exhibited condensed nuclei at 8 h, and over 80% were dead by 18 h. The most dramatic difference was observed approximately 12 h after withdrawal from IL-2, when jasplakinolide treatment resulted in apoptosis of 50–60% of cells, whereas only 10–30% of Me2SO-treated cells were apoptotic (Fig. 3 A and data not shown). CTLL-20 cells incubated with jasplakinolide in the presence of rhIL-2 (100 units/ml) did not undergo apoptosis during the time course of these experiments. A dose-response curve of jasplakinolide demonstrated that concentrations as low as 50 nm were sufficient to enhance apoptosis, whereas concentrations of 25 nm and below had no effect on the apoptotic process (Fig. 3 B). The IC50 for this enhancement was calculated as approximately 35 nm, a concentration similar to the reported IC50 of 34 nm for inhibition of proliferation of a prostate carcinoma cell line (11Senderowicz A.M.J. Kaur G. Sainz E. Laing C. Inman W.D. Rodriguez J. Cres P. Malspeis L. Grever M.R. Sausville E.A. Duncan K.L.K. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1995; 87: 46-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). At the concentrations used in these experiments, the addition of Me2SO (0.02–0.1%) did not increase the number of cells undergoing apoptosis after IL-2 deprivation compared with cells incubated in cRPMI-10% alone (data not shown). To address whether actin stabilization altered the time course of commitment to apoptosis, CTLL-20 cells treated with jasplakinolide or Me2SO were deprived of IL-2 for varying lengths of time, after which 100 units/ml rhIL-2 was added back to the cultures. All samples were incubated for a total of 26 h and then fixed for quantification of apoptotic cells (Fig.4). All treatment groups could be rescued by readdition of rhIL-2 within 8 h of deprivation, whereas neither could be rescued 14.5 h after withdrawal. Notably, readdition of rhIL-2 within 12 h of withdrawal was sufficient to rescue the Me2SO-treated cells, but not those treated with jasplakinolide, suggesting that actin stabilization altered the time course of commitment to apoptosis. Because the stabilization of actin by jasplakinolide altered the time of commitment to apoptosis, we predicted that caspase activity would be detected at an earlier time point in cells that had been treated with jasplakinolide. To test this prediction, we investigated the time course of induction of caspase-3-like activity. It has been previously demonstrated that caspase-3 (CPP32), but not caspase-1 (ICE), is activated in CTLL-20 cells undergoing apoptosis after IL-2 deprivation (24Sarin A. Wu M.-L. Henkart P.A. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 184: 2445-2450Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). CTLL-20 cells were incubated either with jasplakinolide (100 nm) or Me2SO (0.02%) in the absence or presence (100 units/ml) of rhIL-2 for 8 or 12 h (Fig. 5 and data not shown). Cells were lysed, and caspase-3-like activity was assayed using as colorimetric substrate the peptide DEVD-p-nitroanilide. Lysates of CTLL-20 cells deprived of IL-2 for 21 h were used as positive controls for the maximalA 405 achievable within each determination of caspase activity. Caspase-3-like activity was present in the jasplakinolide-treated cells after 8 h of IL-2 deprivation, although not in Me2SO-treated, IL-2 deprived cells (Fig.5). After 12 h of IL-2 deprivation, both jasplakinolide and Me2SO-treated cells contained the maximum caspase-3-like activity detectable (data not shown). These data imply that the stabilization of actin affected the apoptotic process upstream of the caspase cascade, again suggesting that actin stabilization affected the transduction of an apoptotic signal and not just the downstream effector phase of the apoptotic process. Bcl-xL, a member of the Bcl-2 family, has been shown to protect cells from apoptosis induced by cytokine withdrawal (15Boise L.H. McShan C.L. Thompson C.B. J. Immunol. Methods. 1996; 191: 143-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). To test whether Bcl-xL inhibited the enhancement of apoptosis by this actin-modulating agent, CTLL-2 cells overexpressing Bcl-xL were treated with jasplakinolide (100 nm) or Me2SO (0.02%), deprived of IL-2 for the indicated times, and fixed for Hoechst staining and quantification of apoptosis (Fig. 6). Nontransfected CTLL-20 cells treated with jasplakinolide and fixed 16 h after IL-2 deprivation were included for comparison. Overexpression of Bcl-xL delayed but did not prevent apoptosis of CTLL-2 cells, as previously observed (15Boise L.H. McShan C.L. Thompson C.B. J. Immunol. Methods. 1996; 191: 143-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). The stabilization of actin by jasplakinolide increased only slightly the percentage of apoptotic cells after 64 or 72 h of rhIL-2 deprivation, but the rate of onset of apoptosis was unaffected. Thus, Bcl-xLoverexpression appeared to attenuate, if not ablate, the effects of actin stabilization. Jasplakinolide is a cyclodepsipeptide isolated from the marine sponge, Jaspis johnstoni, originally found to be an effective antifungal agent at micromolar concentrations (25Scott V.R. Boehme R. Matthews T.R. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1988; 32: 1154-1157Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) and later found to have antiproliferative activity in the nanomolar range in acute myeloid leukemia and prostate carcinoma cells (11Senderowicz A.M.J. Kaur G. Sainz E. Laing C. Inman W.D. Rodriguez J. Cres P. Malspeis L. Grever M.R. Sausville E.A. Duncan K.L.K. J. Natl.

Jasplakinolide has been shown to induce actin polymerization (10Bubb M.R. Senderowicz A.M.J. Sausville E.A. Duncan K.L.K. Korn E.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14869-14871Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26Holzinger A. Meindl U. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1997; 38: 365-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar,27Lee E.

Cytoskeleton. 1998; 39: 122-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) and to bind F-actin competitively with phalloidin with a dissociation constant (K d) of approximately 15 nm (10Bubb M.R. Senderowicz A.M.J. Sausville E.A. Duncan K.L.K. Korn E.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14869-14871Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); this agent has been used to investigate the functions of actin microfilaments in a variety of cellular processes, including ion transport, endocytosis, and adhesion (28Furukawa K. Smith-Swintosky V.L. Mattson M.P. Exp. Neurol. 1995; 133: 153-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 29Matthews J.B. Smith J.A. Hrnjez B.J. Am. J.

Hogg N. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 699-707Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). Here we demonstrated that jasplakinolide effectively modified the actin cytoskeleton in T lymphocytes (Fig. 1), a property that allowed us to use this compound to investigate a potential role for actin in the transduction of an apoptotic signal in these suspension cells. Stabilization of actin microfilaments by jasplakinolide accelerated commitment to apoptosis of CTLL-20 cells deprived of IL-2. Jasplakinolide did not induce apoptosis in the presence of IL-2 and was thus not toxic to the cells. The enhancement of apoptosis was not specific to CTLL-20 cells nor to IL-2 dependence, as treatment with jasplakinolide also enhanced apoptosis of the pre-B, IL-3-dependent cell line Ba/F3 upon growth factor deprivation. Analysis of DNA content by flow cytometry, DNA fragmentation, and TUNEL confirmed that the nuclear morphology observed by fluorescence microscopy in jasplakinolide- and Me2SO-treated, IL-2-deprived CTLL-20 cells was secondary to the induction of apoptosis, not necrosis (Fig. 2 B and data not shown). The ability of jasplakinolide to enhance apoptosis correlated with its ability to bind to and stabilize F-actin. In addition, stabilization of actin appeared to sensitize the cells to cytokine deprivation; treatment with jasplakinolide increased the percentage of cells that underwent apoptosis at low concentrations of IL-2 (data not shown). Finally, the stabilization of actin appeared to affect the transduction of the apoptotic signal, as the enhancement occurred upstream of commitment to apoptosis and induction of caspase-3-like activity and could be attenuated by the overexpression of the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-xL. The process of apoptosis has been divided into two phases, the initiation/commitment phase and the downstream effector phase (32Vaux D.L. Strasser A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 2239-2244Crossref PubMed Scopus (909) Google Scholar, 33Cohen G.M. Biochem. J. 1997; 326: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (4117) Google Scholar). Actin has long been postulated to play a role in the effector phase of morphologic changes associated with apoptosis (34Brancolini C. Benedetti M. Schneider C. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5179-5190Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar, 35Kayalar C. Ord T. Testa M.P. Zhong L.T. Bredesen D.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 2234-2238Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). Recent reports indicate that actin itself is cleaved during apoptosis (35Kayalar C. Ord T. Testa M.P. Zhong L.T. Bredesen D.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 2234-2238Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar, 36Dipietrantonio A. Hsieh T.-c. Wu J.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Oncogene. 1997; 14: 1007-1012Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar); cleavage of actin has been suggested to be both an effector of the morphological changes associated with apoptosis as well as a mechanism of DNase I activation (35Kayalar C. Ord T. Testa M.P. Zhong L.T. Bredesen D.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 2234-2238Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar, 36Dipietrantonio A. Hsieh T.-c. Wu J.M. Biochem. Biophys.

Tsuruo T. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 5224-5229PubMed Google Scholar). Changes in the levels of total cellular actin and of F-actin have also been associated with the apoptotic process (38Guenal I. Risler Y. Mignotte B. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 489-495PubMed Google Scholar, 42Levee M.G. Am. J. Phys. 1996; 271: C1981-C1992Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We offer evidence to suggest that actin also plays a role in the initial phase of commitment to apoptosis, independent of a requirement for adhesion. The mechanism by which modulation of actin altered the apoptotic signal and/or commitment is unclear. One possibility is that actin stabilization by jasplakinolide has been demonstrated to affect ion transport across the cell membrane in a variety of cell systems (28Furukawa K. Smith-Swintosky V.L. Mattson M.P. Exp. Neurol. 1995; 133: 153-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar,29Matthews J.B. Smith J.A. Hrnjez B.J. Am. J. Phys. 1997; 272: C254-C262Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As apoptosis of CTLL-20 cells in response to IL-2 deprivation is associated with intracellular acidification (43Li J. Eastman A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3203-3211Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar), it could be postulated that an alteration in ion flux could alter the rate of cell death. However, acidification has been shown not to be required for progression to apoptosis (43Li J. Eastman A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3203-3211Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar), and treatment with calcium ionophore did not prevent the effect of jasplakinolide (data not shown); we thus consider this possibility unlikely. An alternative explanation for the modification of the apoptotic process by jasplakinolide stems from the observation that the effective concentrations of jasplakinolide are far lower than the molar content of actin in the cell and that the K d of jasplakinolide binding to F-actin (∼15 nm) (see Ref. 10Bubb M.R. Senderowicz A.M.J. Sausville E.A. Duncan K.L.K. Korn E.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14869-14871Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) is consistent with the IC50 of 34 nm for inhibition of proliferation (11Senderowicz A.M.J. Kaur G. Sainz E. Laing C. Inman W.D. Rodriguez J. Cres P. Malspeis L. Grever M.R. Sausville E.A. Duncan K.L.K. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1995; 87: 46-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar) and for the enhancement of apoptosis (∼35 nm) observed here. The discrepancy in effective drugversus purported target concentrations would suggest either that binding between jasplakinolide and F-actin is positively cooperative (10Bubb M.R. Senderowicz A.M.J. Sausville E.A. Duncan K.L.K. Korn E.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14869-14871Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or that the effect of jasplakinolide results from drug competition with an actin-binding protein present at much lower concentrations in the cell. In this regard, gelsolin has also been shown to displace phalloidin from actin filaments (44Allen P.G. Janmey P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32916-32923Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); whether gelsolin and jasplakinolide compete for the same binding site(s) on actin has not yet been investigated. Gelsolin is a well conserved actin-regulatory protein that can bind actin monomers and sever actin filaments (45Hartwig J.H. Kwiatkowski D.J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1991; 3: 87-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar), and gelsolin has recently been shown to be a substrate of caspase-3 (46Kothkakota S. Azuma T. Reinhard C. Klippel A. Tang J. Chu K. McGarry T.J. Kirschner M.W. Koths K. Kwiatkowski D.J. Williams L.T. Science. 1997; 278: 294-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (1033) Google Scholar). In addition, overexpression of gelsolin has been shown to inhibit apoptosis upstream of the caspase cascade (47Ohtsu M. Sakai N. Fujita H. Kashiwagi M. Gasa S. Shimizu S. Eguchi Y. Tsujimoto Y. Sakiyama Y. Kobayashi K. Kuzumaki N. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4650-4656Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). We are currently investigating a role for gelsolin in this model system of apoptosis. The actin cytoskeletal architecture, by virtue of its ability to organize the cytoplasm by compartmentalizing and localizing proteins, can act as a scaffolding element for signaling intermediates. The enzymatic activities of a few actin-associated proteins, such as casein kinase II (48Karino A. Tanoue S. Fukuda M. Nakamura T. Ohtsuki K. FEBS Lett. 1996; 398: 317-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) and GRK5 (49Freeman J.L.R. De La Cruz E.M. Pollard T.D. Lefkowitz R.J. Pitcher J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20653-20657Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), have been reported to be modified by binding directly to actin. Changes in actin polymerization that altered cytoskeletal architecture could therefore affect either enzymatic activity or substrate availability (see also Ref. 49Freeman J.L.R. De La Cruz E.M. Pollard T.D. Lefkowitz R.J. Pitcher J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20653-20657Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). A number of plausible candidate downstream effectors could thus be influenced by stabilization of the actin cytoskeleton. The Rho family of GTPases has been shown to be involved not only in the regulation of gene transcription, cell cycle progression, and programmed cell death but also in the regulation of actin rearrangement (50Lores P. Morin L. Luna R. Gacon G. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 601-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 51Hall A. Science. 1998; 279: 509-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (5201) Google Scholar, 52Mackay D.J.G. Hall A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20685-20688Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (567) Google Scholar). In addition, signaling intermediates including phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase), protein kinase C-ζ, the Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein, cofilin, and the proto-oncogenes VAV and c-ABL have all been shown to influence cell survival, cell cycle control, and/or the cell death program and have been directly or indirectly implicated in the regulation of the actin cytoskeleton. Pretreatment of CTLL-20 cells with wortmannin, an inhibitor of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, did not affect apoptosis in response to IL-2 withdrawal or the effect of jasplakinolide on this process. Whether modification of actin by jasplakinolide impacts upon signaling pathways other than that of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase is the subject of further investigation. We thank Edward A. Sausville, Kimberly L. K. Duncan, and Paul A. Janmey for invaluable discussions and Hidde Ploegh and Abul K. Abbas for helpful advice.

https://openalex.org/W2040951085,"We report here the cloning, primary structure, heterologous expression, tissue distribution, and localization of a cDNA encoding rat NHE5, a fifth member of the mammalian plasma membrane Na+/H+ exchanger (NHE) gene family. The full-length open reading frame as well as 34 nucleotides of 5′-untranslated and 1443 nucleotides of 3′-untranslated sequences were obtained using a polymerase chain reaction strategy involving reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and 5′/3′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends. The NHE5 cDNA encodes a protein of 898 amino acids with a calculated M r of 99,044 and is predicted to contain 11–13 transmembrane domains. An amino acid comparison of the coding region of rat NHE5 reveals 95% identity with human NHE5. Northern hybridization analysis showed that high level expression of NHE5 mRNA is restricted to brain. Transfection of the coding region of rat NHE5 into NHE-deficient PS120 cells resulted in Na+/H+ exchange activity that was relatively insensitive to the amiloride analogue, 5-(N-ethyl-N-isopropyl) amiloride, with a half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) of 1.53 ± 0.25 μm. In situ hybridization of rat brain sections revealed significant NHE5 mRNA levels in the dentate gyrus with lower levels observed in the hippocampus and cerebral cortex. These results suggest a specialized role for this fifth NHE isoform in neuronal tissues."
https://openalex.org/W2004861927,"Abnormalities of plasma high density lipoprotein (HDL) levels commonly reflect altered metabolism of the major HDL apolipoproteins, apoA-I and apoA-II, but the regulation of apolipoprotein metabolism is poorly understood. Two mouse models of obesity, ob/ob and db/db, have markedly increased plasma HDL cholesterol levels. The purpose of this study was to evaluate mechanisms responsible for increased HDL inob/ob mice and to assess potential reversibility by leptin administration. ob/ob mice were found to have increased HDL cholesterol (2-fold), apoA-I (1.3-fold), and apoA-II (4-fold). ApoA-I mRNA was markedly decreased (to 25% of wild-type) and apoA-II mRNA was unchanged, suggesting a defect in HDL catabolism. HDL apoprotein turnover studies using nondegradable radiolabels confirmed a decrease in catabolism of apoA-I and apoA-II and a 4-fold decrease in hepatic uptake in ob/ob mice compared with wild-type, but similar renal uptake. Low dose leptin treatment markedly lowered HDL cholesterol and apoA-II levels in both ob/ob mice and in lean wild-type mice, and it restored apoA-I mRNA to normal levels in ob/ob mice. These changes occurred without significant alteration in body weight. Moreover, ob/ob neuropeptide Y−/− mice, despite marked attenuation of diabetes and obesity phenotypes, showed no change in HDL cholesterol levels relative to ob/ob mice. Thus, increased HDL levels inob/ob mice reflect a marked hepatic catabolic defect for apoA-I and apoA-II. In the case of apoA-I, this is offset by decreased apoA-I mRNA, resulting in apoA-II-rich HDL particles. The studies reveal a specific HDL particle catabolic pathway that is down-regulated in ob/ob mice and suggest that HDL apolipoprotein turnover may be regulated by obesity and/or leptin signaling.

Gotto Jr., A.M. Allen B. Atherosclerosis. Springer Publishing Co., New York1980: 500-503Google Scholar, 2Breslow J. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 1994; 5: 175-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The protective properties of HDL may be due to its role in reverse cholesterol transport and to antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects in the arterial wall (3Berliner J.A. Naveb M. Fogelman A.M. Frank J.S. Demer L.L. Edwards P.A. Watson A.D. Lusis A.J. Circulation. 1995; 91: 2488-2496Crossref PubMed Scopus (1567) Google Scholar). In humans, low HDL cholesterol levels may be associated with defects in synthesis or catabolism of the major HDL apolipoprotein, apoA-I, with catabolic defects being more common (4Brinton E.A. Eisenberg S. Breslow J.L. Arterioscler. Thromb. 1994; 14: 707-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar, 5Fidge N. Nestel P. Ishikawa T. Reardon M. Billington T. Metabolism. 1980; 29: 643-653Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Low HDL is often accompanied by hypertriglyceridemia, obesity, and insulin resistance, and obese subjects characteristically have accelerated catabolism of HDL apolipoproteins (4Brinton E.A. Eisenberg S. Breslow J.L. Arterioscler. Thromb. 1994; 14: 707-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). A common belief is that low HDL cholesterol reflects increased core lipid exchange between HDL and triglyceride-rich lipoproteins, leading to modifications of HDL composition and size that result in increased catabolism of HDL particles (6Tall A.R. Breslow J.L. Fuster V. Ross R. Topol E.J. Atherosclerosis and Coronary Artery Disease. Lippincott-Raven Publishers, Philadelphia1996: 105-128Google Scholar). HDL from hypertriglyceridemic subjects with low HDL is smaller and more susceptible to renal filtration and degradation (7Horowitz B.S. Goldberg I.J. Merab J. Vanni T.M. Ramakrishnan R. Ginsberg H.N. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 91: 1743-1752Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). However, the liver is one of the principal organs of HDL apolipoprotein degradation, and it is unclear how the hepatic catabolism of the major HDL apoproteins is regulated or mediated (8Glass C. Pittman R.C. Civen M. Steinberg D. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 744-750Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Glass C.K. Pittman R.C. Keller G.A. Steinberg D. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 7161-7167Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, an authentic HDL receptor, scavenger receptor B-I (SR-BI), was identified (10Acton S. Rigotti A. Landschulz K.T. Xu S. Hobbs H.H. Krieger M. Science. 1996; 271: 518-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (1974) Google Scholar). SR-BI mediates the selective uptake of HDL cholesteryl esters in the liver and steroidogenic tissues; however, SR-BI mice do not have defects in catabolism of HDL apoproteins (11Rigotti A. Trigatti B.L. Penman M. Rayburn H. Herz J. Krieger M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 12610-12615Crossref PubMed Scopus (746) Google Scholar, 12Varban M.L. Rinninger F. Wang N. Fairchild-Huntress V. Dunmore J.H. Fang Q. Gosselin M.L. Dixon K.L. Deeds J.D. Acton S.L. Tall A.R. Huszar D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 4619-4624Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar), indicating that this receptor is unlikely to mediate hepatic uptake of apoA-I and apoA-II. Intriguingly, two monogenic mouse obesity models, ob/ob anddb/db, have greatly increased plasma HDL cholesterol levels (13Nishina P.M. Lowe S. Wang J. Paigen B. Metabolism. 1994; 43: 549-553Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). This contrasts with obese humans with low HDL and other mouse models of obesity and diabetes, such as lethal yellow mice, tubby mice, and the brown adipose-ablated transgenic mouse UCP-DTA, all of which have normal HDL levels (13Nishina P.M. Lowe S. Wang J. Paigen B. Metabolism. 1994; 43: 549-553Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 14Hamann A. Flier J.S. Lowell B.B. Z. Ernahr. Wiss. 1998; 37: 1-7PubMed Google Scholar). ob/ob mice were found to have a nonsense mutation in the leptin gene (15Zhang Y. Proenca R. Maffei M. Barone M. Leopold L. Friedman J.M. Nature. 1994; 372: 425-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (11562) Google Scholar), and db/dbmice were shown to have a splicing defect in the gene encoding the leptin receptor (16Lee G.-H. Proenca R. Montez J.M. Carroll K.M. Darvishzadeh J.G. Lee J.I. Friedman J.M. Nature. 1996; 379: 632-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (2091) Google Scholar), resulting in defective leptin production and signaling, respectively. Because ob/ob and db/dbrepresent specific mutations in leptin and its receptor, these findings suggested to us that leptin might play a role in the regulation of HDL apoprotein metabolism. As an initial step in investigating this hypothesis, we have characterized HDL apolipoprotein metabolism inob/ob and db/db mice, and determined whether leptin deficiency is responsible for the high HDL levels. All mice used in these studies were female wild-type, ob/ob, and db/db mice of the pure inbred strain C57BL/6J (purchased from The Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, ME). Mice were between the ages of 8 and 13 weeks old. All mice were fed chow diet. All mice were fasted for 4 h before plasma collections. Native gel electrophoresis was carried out on plasma from mice fasted for 4 h and separated on a 4–20% polyacrylamide gel (Lipo-Gel, Zaxis) and stained with Sudan Black. HDL size was determined using a high molecular weight calibration kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). HDL fractions (1.063 < ρ < 1.21) were isolated from fasted mice by buoyant density ultracentrifugation, and apolipoproteins were separated through a 4–20% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Coomassie Blue-stained SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis gels were destained, and proteins were quantified using scanning densitometry. Isolation of HDL by chemical precipitation (HDL reagent, Sigma) and enzymatic measurements (Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Ltd.) was carried out according to the manufacturers' instructions. HDL was radiolabeled with125I-N-methyl tyramine cellobiose (500 cpm/ng), and 10 μg was injected into the femoral vein. Asialoglycophorin (Sigma) was conventionally labeled with 125I (600 cpm/ng), and 5 μg was injected in the femoral vein. Fractional catabolic rate was calculated by fitting a least squares multiexponential curve to each set of turnover data as previously described (17Le N.A. Ramakrishnan R. Dell R.B. Ginsberg H.N. Brown W.V. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 129: 384-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). ob/ob, db/db, and lean wild-type mice were injected once daily with with either 0.3 μg/g of body weight of leptin (R&D Systems) or 1.0 μg/g of body weight. Control groups of ob/ob, db/db, and lean wild-type mice were injected once daily with saline. All mice were 8 weeks of age at the beginning of the experiments. Saline-injected mice were pair-fed along with the leptin-injected mice of the same genotype. 10 μg of total liver RNA was hybridized with radiolabeled cDNAs of mouse apoA-I, apoA-II, and a 28 S oligonucleotide. ApoA-I and ApoA-II signal levels are reported under “Results” as ApoA-I or ApoA-II signal/28 S rRNA signal. 2.5 μg of liver poly(A+) RNA was hybridized with radiolabeled cDNAs of mouse SR-BI or LDL receptor. Both signal levels were standardized with a radiolabeled mouse B-actin cDNA. PhosphorImager analysis was used for all quantitations. Data were reported for all Northern blots as mean ± S.D. (arbitrary units). SR-BI protein levels in 50 μg of mouse liver membranes were detected using polyclonal antibodies against mouse SR-BI as described previously (18Wang N. Weng W. Breslow J.L. Tall A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21001-21004Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). SR-BI signals levels on x-ray film were quantified by scanning laser densitometry. Both assays were performed as described previously (19Jiang X. Francone O.L. Bruce C. Milne R. Mar J. Walsh A. Breslow J.L. Tall A.R. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 2373-2380Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar,20Cheng C.-F. Bensadoun A. Bersot T. Hsu J.S.T. Melford K.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 10720-10727Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Hepatic lipase assays and PLTP assays were performed on plasma from n = 5 and n = 10 (for each genotype) mice, respectively. Probability values were calculated for each experiment using the Student t test. Previous studies employed nonspecific precipitation methods to show increased HDL cholesterol in ob/ob anddb/db mice (13Nishina P.M. Lowe S. Wang J. Paigen B. Metabolism. 1994; 43: 549-553Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Fractionation of plasma lipoproteins fromob/ob mice by fast protein liquid chromatography confirmed a marked increase in the main peak of HDL relative to plasma from wild-type mice, as well as a shoulder in the region where a large subclass of HDL (HDL1) and LDL elute (Fig.1 A). Native gel electrophoresis of plasma from ob/ob and wild-type mice showed that ob/ob mice have an increased amount and size of HDL (mean increase in diameter, 0.4 nm) and increased HDL1, as well as decreased size, but an unchanged amount of LDL (Fig.1 B). Thus, the hypercholesterolemia of ob/ob mice is due to a marked increase in HDL and HDL1. The apoprotein composition of HDL was next determined inob/ob and db/db mice. ApoA-II levels were 4-fold (ob/ob) and 3-fold (db/db) increased relative to wild-type mice (Fig. 1 C, wt, 286 ± 26;ob/ob, 1136 ± 156; db/db, 788 ± 88 (mean ± S.D); p < 0.005; n = 6 for wt and ob/ob, n = 3 for db/db(arbitrary units)). A more modest elevation in apoA-I was also observed (Fig. 1 C, 1.3- and 1.2-fold, respectively; p< 0.005). The marked increase in apoA-II correlates well with increased HDL cholesterol, as apoA-II levels are an important determinant of HDL cholesterol levels in mice (21Mehrabian M. Qiao J.H. Hyman R. Ruddle D. Laughton C. Lusis A.J. Arterioscler. Thromb. 1993; 13: 1-10Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The increased plasma apoA-I and apoA-II protein levels in ob/ob mice were not due to increased expression of their respective genes (Fig.1 D): hepatic apoA-II mRNA abundance was similar to that of wild-type mice, and surprisingly, apoA-ImRNA levels were reduced 4-fold in ob/ob livers (Fig.1 D, wt, 0.047 ± 0.017; ob/ob, 0.01 ± 0.001 (mean ± S.D., arbitrary units); p < 0.05;n = 6 for each genotype). The greatly increased plasma levels of apoA-II and, to a lesser extent, apoA-I with no change or an opposite change in their mRNA levels suggested that the increase in HDL is due to a catabolic defect of HDL apoproteins. To test this idea, the proteins of intact HDL particles fromob/ob mice were conjugated to a radioiodinated nondegradable tracer, N-methyl-tyramine cellobiose (22Pittman R.C. Carew T.E. Glass C.K. Green S.R. Taylor Jr., C.A. Attie A.D. Biochem. J. 1983; 212: 791-800Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar), and injected into groups of ob/ob and wild-type mice. Fig.2 A shows that the removal of the plasma HDL tracer in ob/ob mice was slower than in wild-type mice. The HDL protein fractional catabolic rate (17Le N.A. Ramakrishnan R. Dell R.B. Ginsberg H.N. Brown W.V. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 129: 384-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) was significantly decreased relative to wild-type mice (0.138 ± 0.029 and .067 ± 0.011 pools/h, respectively; p < 0.01). Moreover, the initial (0–4 h) plasma decay of both apoA-I and apoA-II was markedly reduced, with apoA-I levels decaying at a slower rate than apoA-II in ob/ob mice (Fig. 2 B). The level of the HDL protein tracer in livers of ob/ob mice at the 24-h time point was profoundly reduced (4.3-fold) relative to wild-type livers (Fig. 2 C). No significant difference in the HDL tracer levels were seen in kidneys of ob/ob and wild-type mice, suggesting that ob/ob mice have a HDL protein catabolic defect specific for the liver. The livers ofob/ob mice are moderately enlarged as a result of increased fat deposition (23Joosten H.F. van der Kroon P.H. Metabolism. 1974; 23: 59-66Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). To eliminate the possibility that ob/obmice have a more general defect in liver function resulting from increased liver weight, the activity of the well characterized hepatic receptor for asialoglycophorin was examined (24Hildenbrandt G.R. Aronson Jr., N.N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1979; 587: 373-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Radioiodinated asialoglycophorin was injected into ob/ob and wild-type mice. Fig. 2 D shows that the plasma clearance of asialoglycophorin was slightly faster in ob/ob mice relative to wild-type mice, with similar fractional catabolic rates (0.29 ± 0.04 and 0.21 ± 0.11, respectively). Taken together, these data indicate that ob/ob mice have a liver-specific defect in HDL protein catabolism. Next, we examined the possibility that factors known to alter HDL catabolism might be altered in ob/ob mice. First, the level of the HDL receptor SR-BI was evaluated by Western blot analysis and found to be unchanged (Fig. 3 A, ob/ob, 174 ± 55; wt, 151 ± 8 densitometric units; n = 6 for each genotype); SR-BI mRNA levels were also unchanged (Fig. 3 B, wt, 1.9 ± 0.6;ob/ob, 1.9 ± 0.3 arbitrary units; n = 6 for each genotype). Second, the LDL receptor is known to catabolize large apolipoprotein E (apoE)-containing HDL particles (25Ji Z.S. Dichek H.L. Miranda R.D. Mahley R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31285-31292Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). However, LDL receptor mRNA levels were found to be unchanged (Fig.3 A, wt, 0.38 ± 0.043; ob/ob, 0.39 ± 0.046 arbitrary units; n = 6 for each genotype). Third, the activity of hepatic lipase, an enzyme shown to promote the uptake of HDL by cultured hepatocytes (25Ji Z.S. Dichek H.L. Miranda R.D. Mahley R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31285-31292Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar), was found to be normal (wt, 3695 ± 311 cpm transferred/μl of plasma/h; ob/ob, 4284 ± 339 cpm transferred/μl of plasma/h). Fourth, the activities of PLTP (which circulates bound to HDL and mediates the transfer and exchange of phospholipids between different lipoproteins (19Jiang X. Francone O.L. Bruce C. Milne R. Mar J. Walsh A. Breslow J.L. Tall A.R. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 2373-2380Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar)) was found to be increased (wt, 203 ± 8 cpm transferred/μl of plasma/h; ob/ob, 397 ± 65 cpm transferred/μl of plasma/h; p < 0.001). However, PLTP mRNA levels in the liver of ob/ob mice were unchanged (data not shown). The increased PLTP activity, with no increase in PLTP mRNA, suggests that the increased activity is secondary to increased concentration of HDL particles. These data indicated that it is unlikely that these factors account for the high HDL level in ob/ob mice. These experiments indicate major defects in HDL metabolism inob/ob mice: both decreased synthesis of apoA-I, as implied by decreased apoA-I mRNA, and decreased catabolism of apoA-I and apoA-II. To determine whether abnormalities of HDL were reversible with leptin treatment, low doses of leptin were injected intoob/ob and wild-type mice. Doses of leptin that are suboptimal for weight reduction were used throughout these studies so that no major effects of leptin on adiposity occurred, as measured by body weight. Fig. 4 A shows that mice injected with leptin or saline (and pair-fed) had similar body weights during the course of the experiment (Fig. 4 A), although leptin indeed reduced food intake (data not shown). Fasting levels of plasma HDL cholesterol in leptin-injected ob/obmice were significantly decreased below levels in saline-injectedob/ob mice (Fig. 4 B). After cessation of injections, HDL cholesterol rebounded to saline-injected levels. There was no decrease in plasma HDL cholesterol levels in leptin and saline-injected wild-type mice (Fig. 4 B), nor indb/db mice injected with leptin (day 0, 90 ± 17 mg/dl; day 14, 86 ± 17 mg/dl). However, injection of 3-fold more leptin into wild-type and ob/ob mice resulted in a 25% decrease in HDL cholesterol in both groups (Fig. 4 D), without a decrease in body weight in wild-type mice (Fig. 4 C). Once again,db/db mice injected with leptin showed no decrease in plasma HDL cholesterol levels (day 0, 89 ± 4.2 mg/dl; day 14, 90 ± 7.3 mg/dl). At both lower (Fig. 4 E) and higher (Fig.4 G) doses of leptin, the decrease in plasma HDL cholesterol in ob/ob mice was associated with a 50–60% decrease in HDL apoA-II levels, with no decrease in apoA-II in saline-injectedob/ob mice. Similarly, apoA-II levels were decreased by 45–50% in leptin-injected wild-type mice (Fig. 4, F andH). Leptin did not change steady state HDL apoA-I levels inob/ob or wild-type mice (Fig. 4, E–H). These results indicate a substantial reversal of the increased HDL cholesterol and apoA-II by low dose leptin in ob/ob mice. Moreover, a parallel process occurred in wild-type mice at a 3-fold higher leptin dosage. That more leptin was necessary to cause a decrease in plasma HDL cholesterol in wild-type mice indicates that wild-type mice are less sensitive to the effects of leptin than areob/ob mice, as previous reports suggested for body weight changes and as noted here (26Pelleymounter M.A. Cullen M.J. Baker M.B. Hecht R. Winters D. Boone T. Collins F. Science. 1995; 269: 540-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (3838) Google Scholar, 27Halaas J.L. Gajiwala K.S. Maffei M. Cohen S.L. Chait B.T. Rabinowitz D. Lallone R.L. Burley S.K. Friedman J.M. Science. 1995; 269: 543-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (4184) Google Scholar, 28Campfield L.A. Smith F.J. Guisez Y. Devos R. Burn P. Science. 1995; 269: 546-549Crossref PubMed Scopus (3051) Google Scholar). In addition, leptin treatment did not alter levels of either SR-BI or LDL receptor mRNA in livers ofob/ob and wild-type mice (Fig. 3 B). Although these findings could result if leptin reverses the catabolic defect of HDL proteins in ob/ob mice, apoA-I levels were unchanged by leptin treatment (Fig. 4, E–H). This may be explained if leptin also increases the low levels of apoA-I mRNA observed inob/ob livers (Fig. 1 D), thereby increasing apoA-I synthesis. Indeed, apoA-I mRNA from ob/ob mice treated with leptin was restored to levels of wild-type mice, whereasapoA-I mRNA levels in ob/ob mice treated with saline and db/db mice treated with leptin remained at a low level, with no change in apoA-II mRNA levels (Fig.5). Thus, low dose leptin essentially normalized apoA-II levels (Fig. 4, E and G) and apoA-I mRNA (Fig. 5) in ob/ob mice. However, HDL cholesterol levels remained above wild-type levels (Fig. 4,B and D). The leptin administration studies showed that HDL abnormalities were partly reversible without changes in body weight. To further examine the relationship between HDL and obesity, we measured HDL levels in ob/ob NPY-deficient mice. Mice deficient in NPY and carrying the ob/ob mutation show a 51% reduction in adiposity and a marked attenuation of hyperphagy and diabetes-associated phenotypes caused by theob/ob mutation (29Erickson J.C. Hollopeter G. Palmiter R.D. Science. 1996; 274: 1704-1707Crossref PubMed Scopus (753) Google Scholar). Therefore, we asked whether decreases in plasma insulin, glucose, and adiposity would have a proportional effect on HDL cholesterol levels in ob/ob mice. Despite the attenuation of obesity in npy −/− ob/ob mice (29Erickson J.C. Hollopeter G. Palmiter R.D. Science. 1996; 274: 1704-1707Crossref PubMed Scopus (753) Google Scholar), a lack of NPY on the ob/obbackground did not reduce plasma HDL levels relative to theob/ob mice carrying a functional npy gene (Fig.6). Thus, significant decreases in obesity-related phenotypes do not appear to reduce the high HDL cholesterol levels in ob/ob mice. This study has revealed major alterations in the metabolism of apoA-I and apoA-II in ob/ob and db/db mice. In the case of apoA-I, a striking 4-fold decrease in apoA-I mRNA is offset by a comparable decrease in hepatic catabolism, so that plasma levels are only slightly elevated. Low dose leptin administration reversed the decrease in apoA-I mRNA in ob/ob mice, without changing plasma apoA-I levels. These findings, which imply that leptin enhances the turnover of plasma apoA-I, are reminiscent of its stimulation of glucose turnover without significant changes in plasma level (30Kamohara S. Burcelin R. Halaas J.L. Friedman J.M. Charron M.J. Nature. 1997; 389: 374-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (608) Google Scholar). In contrast to apoA-I, hepatic apoA-II mRNA was unchanged; thus, a marked hepatic catabolic defect resulted in increased HDL apoA-II levels. In mice, increased plasma apoA-II levels are commonly associated with increased HDL cholesterol (21Mehrabian M. Qiao J.H. Hyman R. Ruddle D. Laughton C. Lusis A.J. Arterioscler. Thromb. 1993; 13: 1-10Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, increased apoA-II may be the predominant factor responsible for increased HDL cholesterol in ob/ob mice. The parallel defects in hepatic catabolism of apoA-I and apoA-II provide novel evidence for a specific liver catabolic process that is down-regulated in ob/ob mice. Although altered catabolism of HDL apoproteins commonly underlies variation in HDL cholesterol levels in humans (4Brinton E.A. Eisenberg S. Breslow J.L. Arterioscler. Thromb. 1994; 14: 707-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar, 5Fidge N. Nestel P. Ishikawa T. Reardon M. Billington T. Metabolism. 1980; 29: 643-653Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 31Le N.A. Ginsberg H.N. Metabolism. 1988; 37: 614-617Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), the regulation and molecular mechanisms of apolipoprotein catabolism are obscure. Our findings indicate a catabolic pathway for apoA-I and apoA-II that is liver-specific, down-regulated in ob/obmice, and possibly regulated by leptin. A variety of factors that could potentially be responsible for these effects were excluded, including SR-BI levels, LDL receptor mRNA, hepatic lipase activity, and PLTP and hepatic PLTP mRNA levels. Other potential pathways include the LDL receptor-related protein (32Strickland D.K. Ashcom J.D. Williams S. Burgess W.H. Migliorini M. Argraves W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 17401-17404Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and an apoE-proteoglycan pathway (25Ji Z.S. Dichek H.L. Miranda R.D. Mahley R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31285-31292Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). However, the phenotype of mice overexpressing the LDL receptor-related protein inhibitor RAP suggests that LDL receptor-related protein is unlikely to represent the major catabolic factor for apoA-I and apoA-II (33Willnow T.E. Sheng Z. Ishibashi S. Herz J. Science. 1994; 264: 1471-1474Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). Moreover, apoE accumulation was not particularly prominent in ob/ob or db/db mice (Fig. 1 C), suggesting that it may not be the ligand primarily regulating HDL apoprotein metabolism in these animals.ob/ob mice do have increased lipoprotein lipase (LPL) activity when measured relative to the entire adipose mass (34Rath E.A.H.D. Beloff-Chain A. Diabetologia. 1974; 10: 261-265PubMed Google Scholar). LPL acts by hydrolyzing triglycerides from apoB-containing particles in plasma (35Cooper A. J. Lipid Res. 1997; 38: 2173-2192Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, mice overexpressing LPL do not show increases in HDL apolipoproteins (36Liu M.S. Jirik F.R. LeBoeuf R.C. Henderson H. Castellani L.W. Lusis A.J. Ma Y. Forsythe I.J. Zhang H. Kirk E. Brunzell J.D. Hayden M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11417-11424Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, leptin has recently been shown to increase LPL expression in vivo (37Sarmiento U.B.B. Kaufman S. Ross L. Qi M. Scully S. DiPalma C. Lab. Invest. 1997; 77: 243-256PubMed Google Scholar); therefore, in our experiments to decrease HDL cholesterol, it is unlikely that LPL is responsible for the HDL phenotype in ob/ob mice. Thus, the parallel severe defects in apoA-I and apoA-II catabolism inob/ob mice suggest down-regulation of a novel process, possibly a receptor, mediating HDL particle uptake in the liver. Increased apoA-I gene expression in transgenic mice is associated with a potent, consistent anti-atherogenic effect in different mouse models (38Plump A.S. Scott C.J. Breslow J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 9607-9611Crossref PubMed Scopus (542) Google Scholar, 39Liu A.C. Lawn R.M. Verstuyft J.G. Rubin E.M. J. Lipid Res. 1994; 35: 2263-2267Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The molecular mechanisms of regulation of apoA-I gene expression have been intensively studied, at both the transcriptional and posttranscriptional levels. The proximal 256 base pairs of the human apoA-I gene contain sufficient information to direct high level hepatic expression (40Walsh A. Ito Y. Breslow J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 6488-6494Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and a number of transcription factors appear to be active on the proximal promoter, such as apoA-I regulatory protein-I (41Ladias J.A.K.S. Science. 1991; 251: 561-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar), retinoid X receptor α (42Tzameli I. Zannis V.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8402-8415Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), thyroid hormone receptor (43Taylor A.H. Wishart P. Lawless D.E. Raymond J. Wong N.C. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 8281-8288Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), and early growth response factor I (44Zaiou M. Azrolan N. Hayek T. Wang H. Wu L. Haghpassand M. Cizman B. Madaio M.P. Milbrandt J. Marsh J.B. Breslow J.L. Fisher E.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 1699-1707Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Although a number of pharmacological and dietary factors may signal through these and other transcription factors to affect apoA-I levels, apoA-I gene expression has proven relatively insensitive to physiological change. Some of the states in which there is altered apoA-I gene expression in rodents include experimental hyperthyroidism (1.7–2.5-fold increased apoA-I mRNA) (45Mooradian A.D. Wong N.C. Shah G.N. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: R1602-R1607PubMed Google Scholar), and nephrotic syndrome (2-fold increased apoA-I mRNA) (44Zaiou M. Azrolan N. Hayek T. Wang H. Wu L. Haghpassand M. Cizman B. Madaio M.P. Milbrandt J. Marsh J.B. Breslow J.L. Fisher E.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 1699-1707Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). High fat diets are also associated with a 40% increase in apoA-I synthesis, reflecting increased translational efficiency of apoA-I mRNA (46Azrolan N. Odaka H. Breslow J.L. Fisher E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19833-19838Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The finding of a 4-fold decrease in apoA-I mRNA in ob/ob mice that is completely reversed by low dose leptin administration is notable and may indicate that leptin signaling pathways play a major role in vivo in the regulation of apoA-I synthesis. ob/ob mice have multiple metabolic defects, including obesity, insulin-resistant diabetes, and hypercortisolism (47Muzzin P. Eisensmith R.C. Copeland K.C. Woo S.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 14804-14808Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 48Huang Q. Rivest R. Richard D. Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 1524-1532Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Potentially, any of these or other abnormalities in ob/obmice could be responsible for the metabolic derangement of HDL apoprotein metabolism. Several lines of evidence indicate that the increased HDL levels of ob/ob mice are not solely and simply secondary to obesity or diabetes. First, several other obese diabetic mouse models do not have increased HDL levels (13Nishina P.M. Lowe S. Wang J. Paigen B. Metabolism. 1994; 43: 549-553Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 49Ohki-Hamazaki H. Watase K. Yamamoto K. Ogura H. Yamano M. Yamada K. Maeno H. Imaki J. Kikuyama S. Wada E. Wada K. Nature. 1997; 390: 165-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). Second, in the present study, compound ob/ob, NPY−/− mice had elevated HDL levels similar to ob/ob littermates, despite marked attenuation of diabetes and obesity (29Erickson J.C. Hollopeter G. Palmiter R.D. Science. 1996; 274: 1704-1707Crossref PubMed Scopus (753) Google Scholar). Third, a developmental study in ob/ob mice indicated that increased HDL levels precede the onset of severe obesity (13Nishina P.M. Lowe S. Wang J. Paigen B. Metabolism. 1994; 43: 549-553Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), and this has also been confirmed for the decrease in hepatic apoA-I mRNA levels. 2D. Silver and A. Tall, unpublished results. Fourth, a major part of the HDL abnormalities of ob/ob mice was reversed by low doses of leptin, beneath the threshold needed for weight reduction. Fifth, significant lowering of HDL cholesterol and apoA-II levels was produced in lean wild-type mice by leptin treatment, again without change in body weight. As to hypercortisolism, we have found that MCR4−/− mice, which are obese due to a defect in central leptin signaling, have an elevation in HDL cholesterol and apoA-II levels similar to that of ob/ob mice,2 and these animals do not have elevated plama corticosteroid levels (50Huszar D. Lynch C.A. Fairchild-Huntress V. Dunmore J.H. Fang Q. Berkemeier L.R.G.W. Kesterson R.A. Boston B.A. Cone R.D. Smith F.J. Campfield L.A.B.P. Lee F. Cell. 1997; 88: 131-141Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2515) Google Scholar). This ensemble of evidence suggests that there may be effects of leptin on HDL metabolism that are independent of diabetes, obesity, and hypercortisolism per se. However, because the reduction of HDL cholesterol in response to leptin administration was only partial in ob/ob mice (Fig. 4, B and D), there may be an independent effect of obesity on HDL levels that is not reversed without significant changes in body weight. There are many differences in lipoprotein metabolism between mice and humans. These include the presence of cholesteryl ester transfer protein in humans, mediating core lipid exchange between HDL and triglyceride-rich lipoproteins (51Tall A.R. J. Clin. Invest. 1990; 86: 379-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (583) Google Scholar), and the absence of a correlation between HDL cholesterol and apoA-II levels in human (4Brinton E.A. Eisenberg S. Breslow J.L. Arterioscler. Thromb. 1994; 14: 707-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). However, it is striking that the high HDL phenotype of ob/ob mice is opposite that observed in humans. Because obese humans usually have elevated plasma leptin levels (52Maffei M. Halaas J. Ravussin E. Pratley R.E. Lee G.H. Zhang Y. Fei H. Kim S. Lallone R.R.S. Kern P.A. Friedman J.M. Nat. Med. 1995; 1: 1155-1161Crossref PubMed Scopus (3276) Google Scholar), and some form of central resistance to leptin has been postulated (53Halaas J.L. Boozer C. Blair-West J. Fidahusein N. Denton D.A. Friedman J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 8878-8883Crossref PubMed Scopus (885) Google Scholar), this contrast raises the intriguing possibility that in obese humans there could be direct peripheral actions of elevated leptin on the liver (54Shimabukuro M.K.K. Chen G. Wang M.Y. Trieu F. Lee Y. Newgard C.B. Unger R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4637-4641Crossref PubMed Scopus (612) Google Scholar, 55Cohen S.M. Werrmann J.G. Tota M.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7385-7390Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), leading to accelerated hepatic degradation of HDL apoproteins. Alternatively, there could be central effects of elevated leptin levels that influence HDL metabolic pathways. We thank G. Hollopeter and R. D. Palmiter for plasma samples from npy −/− ob/ob mice, F. Rinninger for providing us with NMTC, J. L. Breslow for many helpful discussions, and I. Tabas for comments on the manuscript."
https://openalex.org/W1987183604,"The promoter element G1, critical for α-cell-specific expression of the glucagon gene, contains two AT-rich sequences important for transcriptional activity. Pax-6, a paired homeodomain protein previously shown to be required for normal α-cell development and to interact with the enhancer element G3 of the glucagon gene, binds as a monomer to the distal AT-rich site of G1. However, although the paired domain of Pax-6 is sufficient for interaction with the G3 element, the paired domain and the homeodomain are required for high affinity binding to G1. In addition to monomer formation, Pax-6 interacts with Cdx-2/3, a caudal-related homeodomain protein binding to the proximal AT-rich site, to form a heterodimer on G1. Both proteins are capable of directly interacting in the absence of DNA. In BHK-21 cells, Pax-6 activates glucagon gene transcription both through G3 and G1, and heterodimerization with Cdx-2/3 on G1 leads to more than additive transcriptional activation. In glucagon-producing cells, both G1 and G3 are critical for basal transcription, and the Pax-6 and Cdx-2/3 binding sites are required for activation.

We report here that the factor that interacts with Cdx-2/3 to form the B3 complex is Pax-6, a member of the pax family of vertebrate genes that contain conserved paired and homeo boxes encoding DNA-binding domains (9Ton C.C.T.

Nature. 1997; 387: 406-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (651) Google Scholar). Our results indicate that the paired domain of Pax-6 is sufficient for interaction with the G3 element, whereas both paired domain and homeodomain are important for interaction with the G1 element. Furthermore, Pax-6 binds to the promoter element G1 preferentially as a monomer but also as a heterodimer with Cdx-2/3. When both Pax-6 and Cdx-2/3 are overexpressed in BHK-21 cells, we observe more than additive effects on transcriptional activation of glucagon gene expression, suggesting that Pax-6-Cdx-2/3 interactions have functional consequences on transcription. We conclude that Pax-6 not only is a key regulator of α-cell development but is also critical for glucagon gene expression through its independent interaction with the promoter and enhancer elements, G1 and G3, respectively.

Quantification of acetylated and nonacetylated forms was done with a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics). A minimum of three independent transfections were performed, each of them carried out in duplicate. Protein concentrations were determined with a Bio-Rad protein assay kit.

Oligonucleotides containing the wild-type or mutated G1 (G1–56, G1–33, G1–33r3, and G1–33r5; see Fig. 1) or G3 (G3; see Fig. 1) sequences have previously been described (5Philippe J. Morel C.

German (University of California) and D.

For construction of GST fusion proteins, pax-6paired, homeo, and paired linker homeo boxes were generated from InR1G9 cells by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction using the primers Pax-6 PD5′, actggatcc-cagcttggtggtgtctttg; Pax-6 PD3′, actaagcttgctagccaggttgcgaagaac; Pax-6 HD5′, actggatccggctgccagcaacaggaag; and Pax-6 HD3′, actaagcttgtgttgctggcctgtcttc and inserted into theBamHI/HindIII sites of pGEX-4T3 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). GST fusion proteins were expressed inEscherichia coli and purified according to the manufacturers' recommendations.l-[35S]Methionine-labeled Cdx-2/3 was generated in vitro using the TNT wheat germ extract system (Promega). For protein-protein interaction, 10 μg of GST or GST fusion proteins were bound to 25 μl of glutathione-Sepharose beads in a total volume of 50 μl of incubation buffer containing 12 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 4 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.9, 50 mm NaCl, 10 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride for 20 min at room temperature. Beads were washed three times, resuspended in 20 μl of incubation buffer, and incubated with 10 μl of l-[35S]methionine-labeled Cdx-2/3 for 40 min on ice. Beads were then washed five times at room temperature with 200 μl of washing buffer (20 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40), recovered in SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis loading buffer, and bound proteins were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by autoradiography. We previously reported that G1 is a large, 50-bp-long proximal upstream promoter element critical for α-cell-specific expression that binds at least three protein complexes, B1, B2, and B3 (Ref. 6Morel C. Cordier-Bussat M. Philippe J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3046-3055Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar and Fig.1). The more distal enhancer element G3 can be separated into an A and a B domain; G3 binds four complexes, C1A and C1B (A domain), which are islet-specific, and C2 and C3 (B domain), representing ubiquitous proteins (Refs. 5Philippe J. Morel C. Cordier-Bussat M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3039-3045Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar and 20Knepel W. Jepeal J.L. Habener J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 8725-8735Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar and Fig. 1). From our previous studies, we concluded that the protein complexes B1 and C1A interacting with the G1and G3 elements, respectively, were similar or identical inasmuch as they displayed closely related binding affinities for both G1 and G3 and migration characteristics in EMSAs (5Philippe J. Morel C. Cordier-Bussat M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3039-3045Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 6Morel C. Cordier-Bussat M. Philippe J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3046-3055Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Recently, Sander et al. (12Sander M. Neubüser A. Kalamaras J. Ee H.C. Martin G.R. German M.S. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1662-1673Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar) provided evidence that the paired homeodomain transcription factor Pax-6 interacts with the A domain of G3 and is critical for α-cell development. We thus investigated the nature of C1A and C1B and their relationship with B1. We first performed EMSAs with nuclear extracts from the glucagon-producing hamster cell line InRlG9 and 32P-labeled oligonucleotides containing either G1 (G1–56) or G3 (G3). As shown in Fig. 2 A, three specific complexes are detected with G1–56, B1, B2, and B3; additional complexes are also observed (indicated by asterisks) but have been shown previously to be nonspecific (6Morel C. Cordier-Bussat M. Philippe J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3046-3055Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Two major complexes interact with the G3 oligonucleotide, C1A and C1B(Fig. 2 B); the ubiquitous complexes C2 and C3 are of lower intensity and visible only on longer expositions (5Philippe J. Morel C. Cordier-Bussat M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3039-3045Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). To more precisely define the relationship between the complexes that bind G1 and G3, we added as competitor cold oligonucleotides containing different portions of the wild-type or mutated element G1 or the wild-type element G3. Like G1–56, G1–33 representing the AT-rich repeat of G1 competed for complexes B1, B2, and B3 formed on G1–56 (Fig. 2 A). Mutant G1–33r5 characterized by a mutation of the 5′ AT-rich site of G1 only competed for B3, whereas the 3′ AT-rich site mutant (G1–33r3) displayed the same competition characteristics as G1–33. Furthermore, oligonucleotide G1–54 containing the 5′ AT-rich site of G1 competed for complexes B2and B3. These results indicate that B1 and B2 interact on overlapping sites within the distal part of G1–33 as previously reported (Ref. 6Morel C. Cordier-Bussat M. Philippe J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3046-3055Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar and Fig. 1); however, B2 may interact on a more restricted site compared with B1 inasmuch as G1–54 efficiently competes for B2 but not for B1. Formation of B3, in contrast, involves both the distal and proximal parts of the core element oligonucleotide G1–33. Of note, oligonucleotide G3 competes for both B1 and B3 (Ref. 5Philippe J. Morel C. Cordier-Bussat M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3039-3045Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar and Fig.2 A). We then applied the same competitor oligonucleotides as in Fig. 2 A on the complexes formed with InR1G9 nuclear extracts and the 32P-labeled oligonucleotide G3 (Fig.2 B). Neither formation of the islet-specific complex C1B nor formation of the ubiquitous complexes C2 and C3 are significantly affected by addition of the competing oligonucleotides (Fig. 2 B and data not shown). In contrast, all oligonucleotides competing for complex B1 on G1–56 (G1–56, G1–33, G1–33r3, and G3), do also compete for C1A formed on G3, and oligonucleotides that do not interfere with B1 (G1–33r5 and G1–54) do not affect C1A. These data show that C1A exhibits similar binding characteristics as B1 and suggest that C1A is capable of binding efficiently to the G1element. To assess the nature of complexes B1 and C1A, we added in the EMSA incubation reactions antisera raised against the paired or homeodomain of Pax-6 (Fig.3 A). Anti-paired domain antibodies displaced B1 and B3 (G1–56), as well as C1A and C1B (G3). Complexes B1 and C1A are also supershifted by antibodies raised against the homeodomain of Pax-6. Of note, addition of both anti-Pax-6 antibodies did not completely displace B1. The residual complex was, however, of variable intensity in different nuclear extracts of InR1G9 cells and also detected with nuclear extracts from insulin-producing cell lines. Whereas this complex was specifically competed for by G-56, it was less efficiently displaced by competition with G1–33 comprising the core element of G1, and not at all with unrelated oligonucleotides (data not shown); it thus may represent a protein present in insulin- and glucagon-producing cells that might play a role in glucagon gene expression via its interaction with G1. Incubation of oligonucleotide G3 with extracts from BHK-21 cells transfected with the avian pax-6cDNA results in a complex that migrates similarly to C1A. This complex is supershifted with Pax-6 anti-paired and anti-homeodomain antibodies and absent from nuclear extracts from BHK-21 transfected with the vector alone; our data thus indicate that B1 and C1A represent Pax-6. Complex C1B, which displays binding characteristics that are different compared with B1 and C1A (Ref. 5Philippe J. Morel C. Cordier-Bussat M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3039-3045Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholarand Fig. 2), is supershifted with anti-paired domain but not with anti-homeodomain Pax-6 antibodies (Fig. 3 A) and may thus represent a protein antigenically related to Pax-6 or a Pax-6 isoform with a deletion or modification in the homeodomain. Complex B3 formed on G1–56 has previously been shown by immunological criteria to consist of a protein complex containing Cdx-2/3 (7Laser B. Meda P. Constant I. Philippe J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28984-28994Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar); its competition by oligonucleotide G3 and its interaction with both anti-Pax-6 antibodies now suggest that B3 may represent a Pax-6-Cdx-2/3 heterodimer. To further characterize complexes B1 and B3, we transfected the avian pax-6 or hamster cdx-2/3cDNA in BHK-21 cells, a cell line that does not express Pax-6 nor Cdx-2/3. As shown in Fig. 3 B, incubation of oligonucleotide G1–56 with extracts from BHK-21 cells overexpressing Pax-6 results in a complex that migrates similarly to B1 and that is absent from nuclear extracts from BHK-21 transfected with the vector alone. Of note, a nonspecific complex with similar migration mobility as Pax-6 and Cdx-2/3 can be observed in vector-transfected BHK-21 cells; this complex does not react with anti-Pax-6 or anti-Cdx-2/3 antibodies (data not shown). When extracts from BHK-21 cells overexpressing Cdx-2/3 are incubated with G1–56, a complex with a slightly lower electrophoretic mobility than B1 and corresponding to Cdx-2/3 appears (Fig.3 B) as previously reported (7Laser B. Meda P. Constant I. Philippe J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28984-28994Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). To test our hypothesis that B3 represents a Pax-6-Cdx-2/3 heterodimer, we incubated the labeled oligonucleotide G1–56 with a constant concentration of BHK-21 nuclear extracts overexpressing Pax-6 together with increasing amounts of Cdx-2/3 containing extracts or increasing amounts of Pax-6 containing extracts at two different concentrations of Cdx-2/3 containing extracts; in these conditions, an additional complex is observed that migrates like B3 and supershifted by anti-Pax-6 and anti-Cdx-2/3 antibodies (Fig. 3 B). Of note, the intensity of the reconstituted complex did not increase linearly; relatively high concentrations of either Pax-6 or Cdx-2/3 may be necessary for heterodimer versus homodimer formation in thisin vitro system. In nuclear extracts from glucagon-producing cells, Cdx-2/3 appears to be present in much lower concentration than Pax-6 because it binds only as the heterodimer B3, whereas Pax-6 binds both as a monomer (B1) and a heterodimer (B3). Indeed, when anti-Pax-6 and anti-Cdx-2/3 antibodies were added to InRlG9 nuclear extracts incubated with labeled G1–56, anti-Pax-6 antibodies displace B1 and B3, whereas anti-Cdx-2/3 antibodies displace only B3 (Fig.4). To test whether the residual complex of low intensity after displacement of B1 by anti-Pax-6 antibodies corresponds to a Cdx-2/3 monomer, we added both anti-Pax-6 and anti-Cdx-2/3 antibodies to the reaction. However, no further displacement was seen, indicating that in InR1G9 cells, Cdx-2/3 binds G1 only as the heterodimer B3. By contrast to anti-Pax-6 and anti-Cdx-2/3 antibodies, anti-Isl-1 antisera (21Wang M. Drucker D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12646-12652Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) did not affect any of the complexes binding to G1–56. To analyze the binding characteristics of Pax-6 on the G1and G3 elements, we expressed the Pax-6 paired, homeo, and paired and homeodomains as GST fusion proteins (Fig.5 A). Whereas the Pax-6 homeodomain was unable to bind to G1 or G3, the paired domain interacted with both elements (Fig. 5 B); however, the binding of the paired domain to G1–56 was very weak, and the resulting complex was readily competed for by unlabeled G3 oligonucleotides. In contrast, a fusion protein comprising both domains exhibited a high affinity for G1 and a relatively lower affinity for G3; the complex formed on G3 was highly competed for by unlabeled G1–56. We therefore conclude that although both the paired and homeodomains of Pax-6 are necessary for maximal interaction with the G1 and G3 elements of the glucagon gene, the paired domain alone is sufficient for about half-maximal binding to G3, whereas it displays very low affinity for G1. To investigate the functional role of Pax-6, we performed cotransfection experiments in BHK-21 cells using fragments of the 5′-flanking sequence of the rat glucagon gene linked to the CAT reporter gene and a SV40-driven expression vector containing the quailpax-6 cDNA. Using the first 350 bp of the glucagon gene promoter (−350 CAT) containing both Pax-6 binding sites (G1 and G3), we observed a dose-dependent increase in CAT activity with increasing amounts of expression plasmids containing the pax-6cDNA. The transcriptional activation observed was similar to that obtained with the transcription factor interacting with the proximal AT-rich site of G1, Cdx-2/3 (Figs.6 and7 A). To characterize the relative functional importance of the proximal (G1) and the distal (G3) Pax-6 binding sites, we investigated the effects of Pax-6 overexpression on promoter constructs containing either one or both Pax-6 binding sites (Fig. 7 A); we used the first 138 bp of the glucagon gene promoter either alone (−138 CAT) or linked to oligonucleotides representing wild-type G3(G3-138 CAT) or G3 specifically mutated at the Pax-6 binding site (G3M6–138 CAT). As shown in Fig.7 B, overexpression of Pax-6 resulted in a 98-fold activation of the basal activity obtained with G3-138 CAT, whereas only half of this activation was observed for either −138 CAT or G3M6–138 CAT (37- and 38-fold activation, respectively). These results indicate that both Pax-6 binding sites are necessary for maximal activation of the glucagon gene promoter in BHK-21 cells and that deletion of the G3 site results in a loss of 50% of the activation potential. We then assessed the consequences of deletions or mutations of the proximal G1 binding sites by using either the first 75 bp of the glucagon gene promoter linked to wild-type G3 (G3-75 CAT, deletion of the Pax-6 binding site on G1) or the first 350 bp of the promoter with point mutations at nucleotides −89/−90 resulting in the loss of Pax-6 binding on G1 (G1M1–350 CAT) (Ref. 6Morel C. Cordier-Bussat M. Philippe J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3046-3055Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar and Figs. 1 and 8 A). A 40-fold stimulation of transcription by Pax-6 was observed for G3-75 CAT, which corresponds to half of the activation obtained with G3-138 CAT (Fig.7 B). With G1M1–350 CAT, transcription increased by 25-fold, which also corresponded to half of the activation seen with the respective control, −350 CAT. When point mutations were directed to the Cdx-2/3 binding site (nucleotides −71/72, G1M11–350 CAT), Pax-6 induced a 78-fold activation. Our results thus indicate that in BHK-21 cells, each Pax-6 binding site of the rat glucagon gene 5′-flanking sequence accounts for about half of the full activation observed when both sites are present. Of note, we always obtained significantly lower stimulation by Pax-6 with the wild-type or mutated 350 first bp of the promoter compared with shorter promoters.Figure 7Pax-6 activates glucagon gene expression in BHK-21 cells through both the G1 and G3 control elements.

(1995) Cancer Res. 55, 5054–5062) owing in part to up-regulation of the transforming growth factor (TGF)-β1 promoter by EGR-1 which suppresses growth by an autocrine mechanism (Liu, C., Adamson, E., and Mercola, D. (1996) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 93, 11831–11836). Here we show that enhanced cell attachment contributes to the suppression via increased secretion of fibronectin (FN) and also of plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1). The secretion of FN and PAI-1 is strongly correlated with EGR-1 expression (R PEARSON = 0.971 and 0.985, respectively). Addition of authentic TGF-β1 to parental cells greatly stimulated secretion of PAI-1 but not FN, whereas addition of TGF-β antibody or lipofection with specific antisense TGF-β1oligonucleotides to EGR-1-regulated cells completely inhibits the secretion of PAI-1 but not FN. However, in gel mobility shift assays pure EGR-1 or nuclear extracts of EGR-1-regulated cells specifically bind to two GC-rich elements of the human FN promoter at positions −75/−52 and −4/+18, indicating that the increased secretion of FN is likely due to direct up-regulation by EGR-1. Moreover, adhesion was greatly enhanced in EGR-1-regulated cells and was reversed by treatment with Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) or PAI-1 antibody indicating that the secreted proteins are functional. We conclude that EGR-1 regulates the coordinated expression of gene products important for cell attachment (“oikis” factor) and normal growth control. Re-expression of EGR-1 in fibrosarcoma HT1080 suppresses transformation including tumorigenicity (Huang, R.-P., Liu, C., Fan, Y., Mercola, D., and Adamson, E.

Addition of authentic TGF-β1 to parental cells greatly stimulated secretion of PAI-1 but not FN, whereas addition of TGF-β antibody or lipofection with specific antisense TGF-β1oligonucleotides to EGR-1-regulated cells completely inhibits the secretion of PAI-1 but not FN. However, in gel mobility shift assays pure EGR-1 or nuclear extracts of EGR-1-regulated cells specifically bind to two GC-rich elements of the human FN promoter at positions −75/−52 and −4/+18, indicating that the increased secretion of FN is likely due to direct up-regulation by EGR-1. Moreover, adhesion was greatly enhanced in EGR-1-regulated cells and was reversed by treatment with Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) or PAI-1 antibody indicating that the secreted proteins are functional. We conclude that EGR-1 regulates the coordinated expression of gene products important for cell attachment (“oikis” factor) and normal growth control. egr-1 was originally identified as an immediate early growth response gene that exhibits a rapid and transient burst of transcription without de novo protein synthesis, following stimulation by a variety of mitogens (1Herschman H.R. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1991; 60: 281-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (945) Google Scholar). EGR-1 is a nuclear phosphoprotein that contains three zinc finger motifs in the C-terminal portion of the molecule, which confer specific DNA-binding properties (2Christy B. Nathans D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 4889-4895Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 3Gashler A.L. Sukhatme V.P. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol.

EGR-1 preferentially but not exclusively binds GC-rich regulatory elements (GCE) 1The abbreviations used are: GCE, GC-rich regulatory elements; TGF-β1, transforming growth factor-β1; FN, fibronectin; PAI-1, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1; RGD, Arg-Gly-Asp; WT-1, Wilm's tumor-1; rh, recombinant human; ECM, extracellular matrix; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; uPA, urokinase plasminogen; uPAR, urokinase plasminogen receptor; GST, glutathioneS-transferase.1The abbreviations used are: GCE, GC-rich regulatory elements; TGF-β1, transforming growth factor-β1; FN, fibronectin; PAI-1, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1; RGD, Arg-Gly-Asp; WT-1, Wilm's tumor-1; rh, recombinant human; ECM, extracellular matrix; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; uPA, urokinase plasminogen; uPAR, urokinase plasminogen receptor; GST, glutathioneS-transferase. with a consensus sequence of 5′-GCG(T/G)GGGCG-3′ (5Nakagama H. Heinrich G. Pelletier J. Housman D.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1489-1498Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). For some GCEs in certain genes, other transcription factors also bind and influence transcription. Examples include Sp-1 binding to the GC-rich region of murine adenosine deaminase gene promoter (6Ackerman S.L. Minder A.G. Williams G.T. Bobonis C. Yeung C.Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 7523-7527Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) or the Wilm's tumor-1 (WT-1) suppression factor binding to a GCE of theTGF-β1 gene which therefore competes with EGR-1 (7Dey B.R. Sukhatme V.P. Roberts A.B. Sporn M.B. Rauscher F.J. Kim S.J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 595-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Several groups have reported that EGR-1 has functional effects in regulating cell growth, differentiation, and development (reviewed in Ref. 8Liu C. Calogero A. Ragona G. Adamson E. Mercola D. Crit. Rev. Oncog. 1996; 7: 101-125Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, the expression of EGR-1 in a variety of human tumor cell lines has revealed growth-inhibiting and -suppressing roles. Conversely, loss or deletion of chromosome region 5q31 containing theEGR-1 locus is seen frequently in patients with myelodysplastic syndrome and acute myelogenous leukemia (9Nagarajan L. Zavadil J. Claxton D. Lu X. Fairman J. Warrington J.A. Wasmuth J.J. Chinault A.C. Sever C.E. Slovak M.L. Willman C.L. Deisseroth A.B. Blood. 1994; 83: 199-208Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10Fairman J.

Decreased or absent EGR-1 expression occurs in non-small cell lung carcinoma (12Levin W.J. Press M.F. Gaynor R.B. Sukhatme V.P. Boone T.C. Reissmann P.T. Figlin R.A. Holmes E.C. Souza L.M. Slamon D.J. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 1261-1269PubMed Google Scholar) as well as in human breast carcinoma (13Huang R.-P. Fan Y. de Belle I. Niemeyer C. Gottardis M.M. Mercola D. Adamson E. Int. J. Cancer. 1997; 72: 102-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). The importance of EGR-1 in the regulation of cell proliferation and tumor formation was demonstrated in experiments that showed that stable overexpression of EGR-1 inhibited transformation in model cells and human tumor lines (13Huang R.-P.

Stable expression of EGR-1 inhibited growth, focus formation, and soft-agar growth in platelet-derived growth factor v-sis-transformed NIH-3T3 cells (15Huang R.-P. Darland T. Okumura D. Mercola D. Adamson E. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 1367-1377PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, expression of antisense egr-1 RNA in the parental NIH-3T3 cells completely eliminated expression of the endogenous EGR-1 (15Huang R.-P. Darland T. Okumura D. Mercola D. Adamson E. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 1367-1377PubMed Google Scholar) and tended to have the opposite morphological effects (14Huang R.-P. Liu C. Fan Y. Mercola D. Adamson E. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 5054-5062PubMed Google Scholar, 15Huang R.-P. Darland T. Okumura D. Mercola D. Adamson E. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 1367-1377PubMed Google Scholar), indicating that endogenous EGR-1 levels may mediate a growth regulatory role. Kieser et al. (16Kieser A. Seitz T. Adler H.S. Coffer P. Kremmer E. Crespo P. Gutkind J.S. Hender D.W. Mushinski J.F. Kolch W. Mischak H. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1455-1466Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) reported that protein kinase C-ζ reverted v-raf-transformed NIH-3T3 cells by induction of egr-1 and Jun-B. Constitutive expression of either egr-1 alone or Jun-B alone suppressed anchorage-independent growth, but maximum suppression required both egr-1 and Jun-B. Similarly, overexpression of protein kinase C-ζ inhibited invasion and metastasis of Dunning R-3327 MAT-Lylu rat prostate cancer cells in syngeneic rats (17Powell C.T. Gschwend J.E. Fair W.R. Brittis N.J. Stec D. Huryk R. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 4137-4141PubMed Google Scholar). Stable overexpression of EGR-1 in human tumor lines such as fibrosarcoma HT1080, osteosarcoma Saos2, glioblastomas U251 and U373, and breast carcinoma ZR75-1 led to decreased DNA synthesis and growth albeit to variable extents (14Huang R.-P. Liu C. Fan Y. Mercola D. Adamson E. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 5054-5062PubMed Google Scholar). The most striking effects were observed in human fibrosarcoma HT1080 cells where proliferation was reduced by 50%, and tumorigenicity was reduced by 40.3% (14Huang R.-P. Liu C. Fan Y. Mercola D. Adamson E. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 5054-5062PubMed Google Scholar). The inhibition of proliferation was highly correlated with the level of EGR-1 expression (14Huang R.-P. Liu C. Fan Y. Mercola D. Adamson E. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 5054-5062PubMed Google Scholar). An approach to understanding the underlying molecular basis for these EGR-1 functions has been to study signal transduction events associated with the expression of EGR-1. Previous studies of the monkey kidney epithelial cell line, CV-1, showed that WT-1 bound to two GCEs of the human TGF-β1 promoter, leading to strong suppression of transcription and that expression of EGR-1 reversed this effect (7Dey B.R. Sukhatme V.P. Roberts A.B. Sporn M.B. Rauscher F.J. Kim S.J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 595-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). In HT1080 cells, transient expression of egr-1 strongly activated a TGF-β1 minimal promoter reporter containing the GCE consensus sequences, whereas coexpression of WT-1 inhibited this effect (18Liu C. Adamson E. Mercola D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 11831-11836Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Similarly, TGF-β1 reporter construct is strongly activated in HT1080 cells that stably expressed EGR-1 (18Liu C. Adamson E. Mercola D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 11831-11836Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Addition of a specific TGF-β1 antibody completely reversed the transformation suppressive effect associated with stable expression of EGR-1, whereas addition of rhTGF-β1 to parental cells suppressed growth. These results indicated that EGR-1 binds to two potential GCE sites of the human TGF-β1 promoter, enhances the expression and secretion of functional TGF-β1 by EGR-1-expressing cells, inhibits cell proliferation, and restores anchorage-dependent growth (18Liu C. Adamson E. Mercola D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 11831-11836Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 19Liu C. Rangnekar V.M. Adamson E. Mercola D. Cancer Gene Ther. 1998; 5: 3-28PubMed Google Scholar). TGF-β1 belongs to the TGF superfamily of cytokines that have been implicated in the regulation of growth, differentiation, development, and apoptosis (20Massagué J. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1990; 6: 597-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (3002) Google Scholar, 21Roberts A.B. Sporn M.B. Sporn M.B. Roberts A.B. Peptide Growth Factors and Their Receptors. Springer-Verlag, Heidelberg, Germany1990: 419-472Google Scholar). TGF-β1 is a potent growth-inhibitory protein in many cell types, including epithelial cells, endothelial cells, lymphocytes, and hematopoietic progenitor cells. Signal transduction by TGF-β1 has been studied intensively. TGF-β1 stimulates the synthesis and accumulation of several extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins, such as FN and several types of collagen and their receptors, respectively (22Chakrabarty S. Int. J. Cancer. 1992; 50: 968-973Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 23Ignotz R.A. Massagué J. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 4337-4345Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Huang S. Chakrabarty S. Int. J. Cancer. 1994; 57: 742-746Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). In addition, TGF-β1 influences the function of pericellular proteases, such as by induction of plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1), which acts on urokinase and inhibits the fibrinolytic pathway thereby stabilizing the ECM (25Laiho M. Saksela O. Keski-Oja J. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 17467-17474Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26Franzen P. Ichijo H. Miyazono K. Exp. Cell Res. 1993; 207: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). PAI-1 also promotes cell adhesion and spreading and acts as a molecular bridge between the cell surface and the ECM (27Planus E. Bariovatz-Meimon G. Rogers R.A. Bonavaud S. Ingber D.E. Wang N. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 1091-1098Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The function of FN has been studied broadly. FN plays an important role in anchoring cells to the extracellular matrix. Inhibition of FN expression leads to a loss of FN from the cell surface and causes oncogenic transformation in vitro (28Carnemolla B. Balza E. Siri A. Zardi L. Nicotra M.R. Bigotti A. Natali P.G. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 1139-1148Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar, 29Oyama F. Hirohashi S. Shimosato Y. Titani K. Sekiguchi K. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 10331-10334Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 30Chandler L.A. Bourgeois S. Cell Growth Differ. 1991; 2: 379-384PubMed Google Scholar) and tumorigenic and metastatic phenotypes in vivo (31Der C.J. Ash J.F. Stanbridge E.J. J. Cell Sci. 1981; 52: 151-166PubMed Google Scholar, 32Zajchowski D.A. Band V. Trask D.K. Kling D. Connolly J.L. Sager R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 2314-2318Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Conversely, the addition of plasma FN to cultures of transformed fibroblasts restores a normal phenotype to cells (31Der C.J. Ash J.F. Stanbridge E.J. J. Cell Sci. 1981; 52: 151-166PubMed Google Scholar). Indeed, overexpression of an intact form of recombinant FN in HT1080 human fibrosarcoma cells suppresses the transformed phenotype, reduces cell migration on the substratum, and suppresses tumor growth in vivo (33Akamatsu H. Ichihara-Tanaka K. Ozono K. Kamiike W.H. Matsuda H. Sekiguchi K. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 4541-4546PubMed Google Scholar). These observations suggest that TGF-β1 may suppress transformation of HT1080 or other tumor cells bearing functional TGF-β1 receptors by induction of one or more of the ECM proteins thereby enhancing the regulatory role of the ECM. We have investigated the production of ECM, specifically FN and PAI-1. Our results show that EGR-1 not only stimulates the expression of TGF-β1, but also greatly stimulates the accumulation of the ECM proteins including FN and PAI-1. We provide evidence that EGR-1 directly transactivates the TGF-β1gene and binds and regulates the FN gene. In contrast, induction of the PAI-1 gene is a secondary effect of EGR-1 and is regulated by the TGF-β1 (40Chang E. Goldberg H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4473-4477Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) transduction pathway. Addition of recombinant FN or PAI-1 proteins to parental HT1080 cells or addition of specific inhibitors of FN or PAI-1 to EGR-1-expressing HT1080 cells shows that all proteins are functional in mediating growth control with enhancing cell adhesion. These results indicate that EGR-1 function to initiate a coordinated program of gene expression leading to increased extracellular matrix formation with enhanced cellular regulation. Fibrosarcoma HT1080 subclone H4 cells, EGR-1-expressing transfectants (H4E2, H4E3, H4E9), neomycin-resistant control cells (H4N), and EGR-1-null cells (H4E4, H4E6) were prepared by transfection of H4 cells with expression vectors for mouse wild-type egr-1 (pCMV-egr-1) as described (14Huang R.-P. Liu C. Fan Y. Mercola D. Adamson E. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 5054-5062PubMed Google Scholar) and were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum and grown in the presence of penicillin and streptomycin, and 200 μg/ml G-418 for all transfectants. Cell numbers were determined by direct cell counting (Coulter Electronics Inc., Hialeah, FL) similar to previous studies (14Huang R.-P. Liu C. Fan Y. Mercola D. Adamson E. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 5054-5062PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were plated at the density of 4 × 104 cells/cm2, incubated overnight, washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and lysed by scraping from the plates with RIPA buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 100 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm aprotinin, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate). The lysates were passed through a 21-gauge needle to shear the DNA, incubated for 60 min on ice, and centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 20 min. The protein concentrations were determined using Bio-Rad protein assay reagent (Bio-Rad). 100 μg of protein were resolved by 7% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), electrophoretically transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA), and incubated with rabbit polyclonal anti-Egr-1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA). Immunoreactive bands were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The intensity of EGR-1-containing bands was determined by image analysis using a Kodak Digital ScienceTM 1D image analysis system (Eastman Kodak Co.). For the plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI-1) assay, 2 × 105 cells were plated in 6-well tissue culture plates in DMEM supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum and incubated overnight. Then cells were subjected to cysteine/methionine-free DMEM in the presence or absence of various doses of recombinant human TGF-β1 (rhTGF-β1, R&D Systems Inc., Minneapolis, MN) in the range 0.001 to 100 ng/ml or 30 μg/ml monoclonal mouse anti-TGF-β1,2,3 (Genzyme Corp., Cambridge, MA) for 2 h at which time [35S]cysteine/methionine was added to 50 μCi/ml (1180 Ci/mmol; Trans-35S-label; ICN Biochemicals Inc., Costa Mesa, CA) for an additional 2 h. Extracellular matrix was prepared as described (31Der C.J. Ash J.F. Stanbridge E.J. J. Cell Sci. 1981; 52: 151-166PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, labeled cell monolayers were rinsed with PBS, and the cytosolic and nuclear proteins were extracted by subsequent washes with hypotonic buffer and sodium deoxycholate. The remaining labeled extracellular matrix proteins were recovered by addition of electrophoresis buffer to the washed wells following by scraping. The samples were subjected to 10% SDS-PAGE, and the gels were treated with Fluoro-HancerTM autoradiography enhancer (Research Products International Corp., Mt. Prospect, IL) for 30 min followed by drying and autoradiography. For the FN assay, 2 × 105 cells were plated in 6-well tissue culture plates. The cells were treated overnight with or without 10 ng/ml TGF-β1 or 30 μg/ml monoclonal mouse anti-TGF-β1,2,3 in cysteine/methionine-free media. The next day, [35S]cysteine/methionine was added to 50 μCi/ml for 2 h. The media were collected and subjected to adsorption on gelatin-Sepharose beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) in the presence of 0.5% Triton X-100 as described (34Cárcamo J. Weis F.M.B. Ventura F. Wieser R. Wrana J.L. Attisano L. Massagué J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 3810-3821Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The samples were resolved by 7% SDS-PAGE, and the gels were treated with Fluoro-HancerTM for 30 min followed by drying and autoradiography. Antisense 14-base phosphorothioate oligodeoxynucleotides corresponding to the human TGF-β1mRNA and the corresponding scrambled sequence control were synthesized by Trilink Biotec. Inc. (San Diego, CA) and consisted of the antisense sequence of 5′-CGA TAG TCT TGC AG-3′ and scrambled control sequence of 5′-GTC CCT ATA CGA AC-3′ previously shown to completely and specifically eliminate TGF-β1 expression (64Paulus W. Baur I. Huettner C. Schmauber B. Roggendorf W. Schlingensiepen K.H. Brysch W. J. Neuropathol. Exp. Neurol. 1995; 54: 236-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). To introduce the oligonucleotides into fibrosarcoma HT1080 subclone H4 cells or the egr-1-transfected clones, a cationic liposome-mediated transfection method was used (65Felgner P.L. Gadek T.R. Holm M. Roman R. Chan H.W. Wenz M. Northrop J.P. Ringold G.M. Danielsen M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 7413-7417Crossref PubMed Scopus (4355) Google Scholar). Briefly, oligonucleotides dissolved in 1 volume of antibiotic-free medium were mixed with LipofectinTM reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.) dissolved in same volume of antibiotic-free medium and incubated for 15 min at room temperature. Thereafter, the oligonucleotides-liposome complexes were diluted with 4 volumes of antibiotic-free medium and then added to cells that had been grown to 60% confluence and washed twice with antibiotic-free medium. The concentration of oligonucleotides and Lipofectin in the transfection medium was 1 mm and 1%, respectively. After 4 h, fresh normal growth medium containing 5% fetal bovine serum was added. Forty-eight hours later the cells were analyzed for the expression of PAI-1 or FN. Nuclear extracts were prepared from the clone of maximum EGR-1 expression (H4E9) and from non-expressing cells (H4, H4N) as described (35Brown D.A. Kondo K.L. Wong S.W. Diamond D.J. Eur. J. Immunol. 1992; 22: 2242-2419Crossref Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The protein concentrations in the nuclear extracts were determined by protein assay reagent (Bio-Rad). Synthetic double-stranded oligonucleotides bearing sequences corresponding to either −75 to −52 base pairs or −4 to +18 base pairs of the humanFN promoter, termed sites A and B, respectively (36Dean D.C. Bowlus C.L. Bourgeois S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 1876-1880Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), were selected based on an analysis of the sequence of the humanFN promoter region for the presence of GCEs (Transcription Element Search Software). The DNA sequences for the two oligonucleotides are for site A, 5′-GATCTCTCTCCTCCCCCGCGCCCCGGGG-3′; and for site B, 5′-GATCTCCGACGCCCGCGCCGGCTGTG-3′. The prototypic EGR-1-binding sites are underlined. The oligonucleotides of sites A and B were end-radiolabeled with [γ-32P]ATP by use of T4 polynucleotide kinase according to supplier specification (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and used as “probes” A and B. Gel shift assays were performed as follows: nuclear extracts (20 μg) were incubated with radiolabeled DNA probe (1 × 105 cpm) for 20 min at 4 °C in a 20-μl reaction containing 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 60 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 100 μg/ml spermidine, 10% glycerol, and 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin. Protein-DNA complexes were separated from free DNA probe by electrophoresis through 6% nondenaturing acrylamide gels in 0.5× Tris borate/EDTA. The gels were dried and exposed to x-ray film (Kodak X-OMAT, Kodak) for autoradiography. For the competition experiments, excess unlabeled oligonucleotides for sites A and B, or oligonucleotides containing two consensus EGR-1-binding sequences (GCE) and mutated EGR-1-binding sequences (mGCE), were incubated with the reaction mixture for 15 min at 4 °C before the addition of the radiolabeled probes A and B. Similarly, in the antibody supershift experiments, the specific antibodies against Sp1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) or rabbit polyclonal Egr-1 antiserum (15Huang R.-P. Darland T. Okumura D. Mercola D. Adamson E. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 1367-1377PubMed Google Scholar) were added to the binding reactions and incubated before the appropriate radiolabeled probe was added. Recombinant GST-EGR-1 fusion protein or wild-type FLAG-tagged-EGR-1 and FLAG-tagged-EGR-1ΔS348A/S350A mutant fusion proteins were used as controls. Mutations were introduced at the DNA-binding sites by the Quick Change method using polymerase chain reaction primers containing the S348A/S350A mutations (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). ELISA plates (Sarstedt Inc., Newton, NC) or 35-mm polystyrene Petri dishes (Falcon, Becton Dickinson, Bedford, MA) were used for adhesion assays. For the cell adhesion assay in Petri dishes, the cells were added to polystyrene Petri dishes at 3 × 104 cells/cm2. After incubation for 4 or 7 h, non-attached cells were washed off by using PBS at 37 °C, and adherent cells were harvested by adding trypsin and counted with a Coulter counter (Coulter Electronics Inc., Hialaeh, FL). In some cases, 96-well ELISA plates were coated with 5 μg/ml or 0.25 μg/ml human plasma FN (Boehringer Mannheim) or 5 μg/ml recombinant active human PAI-1 (American Diagnostica Inc, Greenwich, CT) for 1 h at 37 °C. Non–specific sites were blocked by addition of 0.1% bovine serum albumin in PBS, and cells were plated at 4 × 104 cells/well. After incubation for varying times, any non-adherent cells were removed with gentle washing with warm PBS. Adherent cells were stained with 1% crystal violet in 20% methanol for 15 min and then washed with distilled water and solubilized with 2% SDS. The absorbance of the solution at 590 nm was quantified using a microtiter plate reader. For PAI-1 neutralization, monoclonal antibody against human PAI-1 (American Diagnostica Inc., Greenwich, CT) was added to plates at 10 μg/ml together with cells, and its effects on adhesion were observed. For FN inhibition, GRGDSP and GRGESP peptides, provided by Dr. R. Pasqualini (The Burnham Institute, La Jolla, CA), were added at 10–50 μg/ml at the time of cell addition to the FN-coated plates. Fibrosarcoma HT1080 subclone H4 cells have been stably transfected with an expression vector for wild-type EGR-1 (14Huang R.-P. Liu C. Fan Y. Mercola D. Adamson E. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 5054-5062PubMed Google Scholar). A series of transfectants that express graded amounts of EGR-1 were used to determine whether PAI-1 or FN was synthesized and secreted in proportion to the amount of EGR-1 expressed by these cells. The relative expression of EGR-1 was reconfirmed here by Western blot analysis (Fig. 1 A). The results confirmed that H4E9 clone expresses the largest amount of EGR-1, taken as 100%, whereas the remaining clones express graded levels of EGR-1: H4E2 (21%) and H4E3 (8.7%). H4E4 and H4E6 do not express detectable levels of EGR-1 similar to the results for the parental H4 cells and empty vector control cells H4N (Fig. 1 A). The PAI-1 expression was examined in these graded EGR-1-expressing clones. In metabolically labeled EGR-1-expressing H4 clones, H4E9 cells expressed the greatest amount of PAI-1, whereas H4E2 also expressed more PAI-1 than parental cells or negative control clones (Fig.1 B). Quantitative analysis of the average of five independent experiments showed >5-fold elevation of PAI-1 in H4E9 clone (Fig. 1 C). In contrast, The pCMV empty vector-transfected clones or EGR-1-negative clones, H4E6 and H4E4 (G418-resistant clones), expressed low levels of PAI-1 similar to the parental H4 cells (Fig. 1, B and C). Indeed, the expression of PAI-1 and EGR-1 is highly correlated with the expression of EGR-1 (R PEARSON = 0.971, p < 0.0003) (Fig. 1 C, inset). We previously showed that expression and secretion of TGF-β1 was in direct proportion to the levels of expression of EGR-1 in these graded clonal series (R PEARSON = 0.96) and functions in an autocrine loop to regulate growth of these cells (18Liu C. Adamson E. Mercola D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 11831-11836Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Moreover, TGF-β1 can stimulate the expression of PAI-1 (37Laiho M. Keski-Oja J. Cancer Res. 1989; 49: 2533-2553PubMed Google Scholar, 38Laiho M. Ronnstrand L. Heino J. Decaprio J.A. Ludlow J.W. Livingston D.M. Massagué J. Mol. Cell.

To test whether TGF-β1 could in fact stimulate the expression of PAI-1 in our clones, the cells were labeled with [35S]cysteine/methionine in the presence or absence of 10 ng/ml of recombinant human TGF-β1 (rhTGF-β1) for 4 h. The expression of PAI-1 was monitored by electrophoresis and autoradiography (Fig. 1 B). All clones exhibited a significant (p < 0.05) increase in the secretion of PAI-1 following treatment with rhTGF-β1 (Fig. 1 C). Thus, the secretion of PAI-1 in the clones of our series all responded to rhTGF-β1 treatment. Moreover, the total PAI-1 observed for each clone correlated with basal PAI-1 levels observed in"

To surmount these difficulties, we used probability analysis to determine the most effective crystallization approach and derive equations which show that a strategy, which we term variational crystallization, substantially enhances the overall probability of crystallization for gp120. Variational crystallization focuses on protein modification as opposed to crystallization screening. Multiple variants of gp120 were analyzed with an iterative cycle involving a limited set of crystallization conditions and biochemical feedback on protease sensitivity, glycosylation status, and monoclonal antibody binding. Sources of likely conformational heterogeneity such asN-linked carbohydrates, flexible or mobile N and C termini, and variable internal loops were reduced or eliminated, and ligands such as CD4 and antigen-binding fragments (Fabs) of monoclonal antibodies were used to restrict conformational mobility as well as to alter the crystallization surface. Through successive cycles of manipulation involving 18 different variants, we succeeded in growing six different types of gp120 crystals. One of these, a ternary complex composed of gp120, its receptor CD4, and the Fab of the human neutralizing monoclonal antibody 17b, diffracts to a minimum Bragg spacing of at least 2.2 Å and is suitable for structural analysis.

In conventional crystallizations of biological macromolecules, the protein or other macromolecular subject is treated as a fixed entity to be tested in a multitude of crystallization conditions. Despite advances such as sophisticated screening procedures (1Carter Jr., C.W. Carter C.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 12219-12223Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 2Jancarik J. Kim S.H. J.

BioTechniques. 1989; 7: 522-527PubMed Google Scholar), this approach often fails for components from complex biological systems. One of these, the subject of this study, is the HIV-1 1The abbreviations used are: HIV, human immunodeficiency virus; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; PEG, polyethylene glycol; Fab, antigen binding fragment of an antibody. exterior envelope glycoprotein, gp120. In such cases, success may follow if the protein itself is varied. There are, however, many options in this vein and it is not clear how they might be prioritized. By way of background for this study, we first consider various options for the crystallization of conformationally complex macromolecules and then describe the characteristics of gp120. For the more difficult crystallization challenges, which can be defined as those for which conventional screening fails, one typically tries to vary or modify the protein while maintaining biologically important properties. Meaningful results are obtained since the integrity of internal structure and functional properties can often tolerate variation at the molecular surface where lattice contacts are made. The probability for success in crystallization is enhanced because flexible or heterogeneous surface features may be removed or because of the fortuitous introduction of lattice interactions. A prescient example that pre-dates the powerful methods of modern molecular biology was Kendrew's (5Kendrew J.C. Parrish R.G. Proc. R. Soc. Lond. A. 1956; 238: 305-324Crossref Google Scholar) screening of myoglobins from many different organisms until he found one, from sperm whale, that crystallized well. Indeed, human myoglobin requires a Lys to Arg substitution in order to produce crystals suitable for structural analysis (6Hubbard S.R. Hendrickson W.A. Lambright D.G. Boxer S.G. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 213: 215-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Conversely, crambin forms exceptionally well ordered crystals despite being a mixture of two isoforms with sequence variation at internal residues (7Teeter M.M. Hendrickson W.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1979; 127: 219-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). There are many notable examples of variation or modification in the crystallization of macromolecules. Systematic variation in the species of origin, as pioneered with myoglobin (5Kendrew J.C. Parrish R.G. Proc. R. Soc. Lond. A. 1956; 238: 305-324Crossref Google Scholar), was also instrumental in the crystallization of the transcription initiating TATA-binding protein (8Nikolov D.B. Hu S.H. Lin J. Gasch A. Hoffmann A. Horikoshi M. Chua N.H. Roeder R.G. Burley S.K. Nature. 1992; 360: 40-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). Proteolysis is often used to define crystallizable fragments, following the early examples from enzymatic digestions of antibodies that produced crystallizable fragments (reviewed in Ref. 9Porter R.R. Science. 1973; 87: 713-716Crossref Scopus (99) Google Scholar) and the bromelain release of hemagglutinin from the influenza virus membrane (10Brand C.M. Skehel J.J. Nature. 1972; 87: 713-716Google Scholar). Variation of recombinant constructs, often inspired by proteolytic definition, is now commonplace with the widespread use of molecular biology tools. Systematic variation in the length of DNA oligomers has proved essential in the structural studies of protein-nucleic acid complexes. The work of Jordan and Pabo (11Jordan S.R. Whitcombe T.V. Berg J.M. Pabo C.O. Science. 1985; 230: 1383-1385Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) on λ repressor sets the example for transcription factors, and the principle extends to other complexes such as the nucleosome (12Luger K. Mader A.W. Richmond R.K. Sargent D.F. Richmond T.J. Nature. 1997; 389: 251-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (6991) Google Scholar). The use of protein ligands to stabilize another protein of interest for crystallization has also been effective as in the study of actin through its complex with DNase I (13Kabsch W. Mannherz H.G. Suck D. Pai E.F. Holmes K.C. Nature. 1990; 347: 37-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (1546) Google Scholar) and more generally through complexes with antigen-binding Fab fragments of antibodies (reviewed in Ref. 14Kovari L.C. Momany C. Rossmann M.G. Structure. 1995; 3: 1291-1293Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The principle that the detergent-solubilized lipid interface of membrane proteins is generally unavailable for lattice contacts has led to the concept that crystallizability will be enhanced if the non-variable surface area is increased, and this was demonstrated in practice in the crystallization of a bacterial cytochrome oxidase in complex with an antibody Fv fragment (15Ostermeier C. Iwata S. Ludwig B. Michel H. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 842-846Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Similarly, the anticipated conformational and compositional heterogeneity in carbohydrate moieties of glycoconjugates is expected to interfere with crystallization, and deglycosylation has proved essential for heavily glycosylated proteins such as human chorionic gonadotropin (16Lustbader J.W. Birken S. Pileggi N.F. Gawinowicz M.A. Pollak S. Cuff M.E. Yang W. Hendrickson W.A. Canfield R.E. Biochemistry. 1989; 1989: 9239-9243Crossref Scopus (52) Google Scholar).

Although the structure of the gp120-binding domain of CD4 and the identity of residues critical to its interaction with gp120 have been known for several years (27Ryu S.-E. Kwong P.D. Truneh A.

As the major virus-specific antigen accessible to neutralizing antibodies, knowledge of the gp120 structure could also impact considerably on vaccine design. Despite this interest and considerable effort for several years with pure soluble protein, available in quantities as a by-product in part from vaccine trials, gp120 has resisted crystallographic analysis. The mature gp120 glycoproteins of different HIV-1 strains typically have 470–490 amino acid residues (32Myers G. Wain-Hobson S. Henderson L. Korber B. Jeang K.-T. Pavlakis G. Human Retroviruses and AIDS. A Compilation and Analysis of Nucleic Acid and Amino Acid Sequences. Los Alamos National Laboratory, Los Alamos, NM1996Google Scholar). Extensive N-linked glycosylation at 20–25 sites accounts for roughly half of the gp120 mass (32Myers G. Wain-Hobson S. Henderson L. Korber B. Jeang K.-T. Pavlakis G. Human Retroviruses and AIDS.

Sequences from many different viral isolates show that gp120 has five variable regions (V1-V5) interspersed between relatively conserved regions (C1-C5) (32Myers G. Wain-Hobson S. Henderson L.

Indeed, even after extensive proteolytic cleavage, the unreduced protein runs near its native molecular weight on SDS-PAGE. 2P. D. Kwong, unpublished data. The gp120 glycoprotein likely exhibits conformational flexibility. Some of the variable regions, the V2 and V3 loops in particular, are known to be exposed on the surface of the native protein and probably assume multiple conformations. The potential of gp120 to undergo conformational change is also evidenced by shedding, the CD4-induced dissociation of gp120 from the surface of the virus, by ligand-induced variations in monoclonal antibody binding (35Sattentau Q.J. Moore J.P. Vignaux F. Traincard F. Poignard P. J. Virol. 1993; 64: 7383-7393Crossref Google Scholar, 36Thali M. Moore J.P. Furman C. Charles M. Ho D.D. Robinson J. Sodroski J. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 3978-3988Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and by complex CD4-gp120 binding kinetics (37Wu H. Myszka D.G. Tendian S.W. Brouillette C.G. Sweet R.W. Chaiken I.M. Hendrickson W.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 15030-15035Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). These changes may be related to the functional role of gp120 in virus entry. The extensive glycosylation and conformational heterogeneity of gp120 suggested that merely screening the protein through ever more exotic crystallization conditions would not produce well diffracting crystals. We have analyzed the effectiveness of optimizing different crystallization factors given the specific characteristics of gp120. This led us to a strategy employing radical modification of the protein surface, primarily to reduce heterogeneity but also to create new potential lattice contacts. We derive equations which show that this strategy, which we term variational crystallization, substantially enhances the overall probability of crystallization for gp120. An iterative process, involving both biochemical and molecular biological techniques, was used to detect and remove chemical and conformational heterogeneity. In addition, protein ligands, namely CD4 and the Fab fragments of several monoclonal antibodies, were used to restrict conformational mobility. Progressive trials of 18 different gp120 crystallization variants yielded six different crystals, at least one of which is suitable for structural analysis. This paradigm of crystallization, with a focus on protein modification rather than on crystallization screening, may aid in the structural analysis of other conformationally complex proteins. Much of the crystallization literature is anecdotal, reflective perhaps of the diverse nature of proteins. Systematic quantitative studies have necessarily focused on robust, well characterized systems (38Ducruix A. Giege R. Crystallization of Nucleic Acids and Proteins: The Practical Approach Series. Oxford University Press, Oxford1992Google Scholar). If a particular protein fails to crystallize, one is faced with a bewildering array of options based on experience with other often quite different proteins. In the absence of a comprehensive crystallization theory it is difficult to know how to proceed. Here, we devise an approximate theoretical underpinning for such decisions based on the ratio comparing crystallization probabilities before (p i) and after (p f) a modifying procedure. We define the enhancement in crystallization probability as ε = p f/p i − 1, whereby ε = 0 for no change and can reach a maximum, εmax = 1/p i − 1, that depends on the inverse of the initial probability. In evaluating different crystallization strategies, one important consideration is effectiveness. Many factors affect crystallization, and a suitable crystallization approach depends on identifying and dealing with those that are most limiting. For example, if a protein were only 30% pure, the crystallization probability associated with such protein purity would be low and a purification strategy would be key; if a protein were 98% pure, further purification would most likely have little impact on the overall probability of crystallization. Factors that might be expected to affect the crystallization of gp120 are listed in TableI, along with estimates of the effect of optimizing each factor given the specific characteristics of gp120.Table IFactors affecting the crystallization of gp120Crystallization factorSpecific gp120 characteristicsOptimizationaEstimate of the effect on the crystallization probability of a strategy which optimizes the particular factor.

Open table in a new tab Although identification of limiting crystallization factors can establish rough guidelines as to the appropriateness of a particular crystallization strategy, a better way to evaluate effectiveness (or perhaps to judge the progress of a specific crystallization effort) is by quantitative assessment of the en- hancement in crystallization probability. For example, if 80% of all crystallizable proteins crystallize from a core set of 50 conditions (2Jancarik J. Kim S.H. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1991; 24: 409-411Crossref Scopus (2076) Google Scholar), a strategy that involves screening ever larger arrays of crystallization conditions could at most enhance the probability of crystallization by only 25% over that for the first 50 conditions; further screening would yield increasingly diminishing returns. With this screening example, the quantitative enhancement of probability is straightforward to calculate, but it is not immediately apparent for the strategy of variational crystallization, which focuses on protein modification. Here we consider two kinds of such modifications: those designed to reduce heterogeneity and those related to expanding the number of crystallization candidates. Crystalline order is explicitly dependent on lattice homogeneity. Reducing heterogeneity can be thought of as increasing the proportion of surface area available for formation of lattice contacts, increasing the probability of crystallization. The probability that a single lattice contact between two molecules may form is in part related to the fraction of surface area that is homogeneous on one molecule multiplied by the fraction homogeneous on the other, p(homogeneous contact)∝H(molecule1)×H(molecule2)Equation 1 where H is defined as the homogeneous fraction of the surface. Consider the case where the molecule in question is the smallest repeating unit in a crystal, that is, the asymmetric unit. In such a case molecule 1 and molecule 2 are equal, and the above equation reduces to (% homogeneous surface)2. Now consider the same scenario with two lattice contacts: the probability that both are homogeneous is related to [(H-∂1̄)2 × (H-∂2̄)2], where “H” is the homogeneous fraction of the surface which may form lattice contacts and “∂n̄” is a function of the relative size and total number of lattice contacts other than contactn and the degree and distribution of surface homogeneity, related to the occlusion of available surface area upon formation of each lattice contact as well as the spatial distribution of homogeneous surface over the molecular surface. Generalizing to the case of “C” lattice contacts, the probability associated with homogeneous lattice formation is related to, [I]=k“k”−k'[W]0e−k't−k“k”−k'[W]0e−k“tEquation 2 In the restricted case of one molecule per asymmetric unit, the observed average value of (C ave) is ∼4.5 (39Wukovitz S.W. Yeates T.O. Nature Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 1062-1067Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar), with a minimum theoretical value for the most common space groups of 2 or 3 (39Wukovitz S.W. Yeates T.O. Nature Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 1062-1067Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Since C may be relatively small, lattice contacts may make up only a small proportion of a macromolecule surface, with considerable surface heterogeneity tolerated. Thus, for example, many proteins that pack into well ordered crystal lattices have disordered regions, with N and C termini as well as internal loops being unresolved. Given a reduction in surface heterogeneity, what is the change in crystallization probability? Surface area is correlated with molecular mass (M) by the power law: surface area = 6.3 × M0.73, which on average predicts surface area to within 4% for monomeric proteins (40Miller S. Jannin J. Lesk A.M. Chothia C. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 196: 641-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (836) Google Scholar). The fraction of homogeneous surface can thus be approximated as a ratio of molecular masses of the total and of the homogeneous portion of the protein, H≈[M(homogeneous)/M(total)]0.73Equation 3 From Equations 2 and 3, it is now possible to estimate the enhancement in probability for crystallization upon reduction of heterogeneity. With the simplifying approximation ∂n̄ ≈ 0, the probability ratio of before (p i) and after (p f) becomes, [M(homogeneous)i/M(total)i]1.46×CEquation 4 Equation 4 is still not very useful, however, since M(homogeneous) is unknown and molecule-specific. In reducing heterogeneity, however, it seems reasonable to assume that the removed portion, if it were a highly branched carbohydrate or a proteolytically exposed region, is completely heterogeneous. In such cases, [M(homogeneous)f ≈ M(homogeneous)i] whether or not all heterogeneity has been removed. Assuming that C ≈C ave, the enhancement (εr) in probability on removal of a heterogeneous portion becomes, εr=pf/pi−1≈[M(total)i/M(total)f]1.46×Cave−1Equation 5 This last equation allows the change in crystallization probability upon heterogeneity removal to be quantified. For example, consider a situation where a recombinant DNA approach is used to produce a protein with an affinity tag of 10 amino acid residues. Is it important to remove these presumably flexible residues? From Equation5, the answer depends on the protein size. For a 100-residue protein, removal of the tag would greatly enhance the crystallization probability by: εr =p f/p i − 1 ≈ [110/(110−10)] 1.46 × 4.5 − 1 = 0.87, or almost 90%, whereas for a 500-residue protein the enhancement would be minimal, εr = 0.14. Another variant of Equation 4 can be used to estimate the impact of adding a ligand of fixed structure to a molecule that contains heterogeneous portions. This expands the surface available for lattice contacts and effectively dilutes the heterogeneous component. It may be an approach of choice when the heterogeneity is essentially unremovable, such as at the lipid interface of detergent-solubilized membrane proteins. One faces the difficulty of estimating the extent of heterogeneity to use Equation 4, but this might be done by summing residual variable components or by topographical estimates for a membrane protein. (For example, for a sphere embedded symmetrically in a membrane of thickness h, 1−H = area(heterogeneous)/area(total)=h/[6Mv¯/(πNo)]13, where M is molecular mass,v̄ is partial specific volume, and No is Avogadro's number. Thereby, 1-H = 0.62 for h = 30 Å and M = 50 kDa.) Then the enhancement (εa) in probability on addition of a fixed component becomes, εa≈{[M(total)i/M(total)f]×[M(total)f−M(hetero)i]/[M(total)i−M(hetero)i]}1.46×Cave−1Equation 6 In the instance of a 50-kDa protein, half of which is heterogeneous, to which a 25-kDa Fv fragment is complexed, εa= {5075 × [75–25]/[50–25]}1.46×4.5 − 1. Thus if the overall crystallization probability of the protein was initially only 1 chance in 10, assuming all other crystallization probability components remained unchanged, the crystallization probability of the Fv fragment complex would be roughly 1 chance in 2, a substantial enhancement. The accuracy of the quantification is only as good as the approximations, and several of the approximations used here call for further scrutiny. The approximation of molecular mass for surface area was used for the initial protein prior to heterogeneity removal. This is probably an underestimate since the completely heterogeneous portions of the protein would not be expected to fold as compactly as the homogeneous portions. In addition, the approximation that ∂n̄ ≈ 0, tends to underestimate the deleterious influence of heterogeneity on crystallization. Both of these assumptions show an underestimation, but the equations still should predict the correct general trend. For some assumptions, however, the effect is more subtle. For example, the equations were generated assuming one molecule per asymmetric unit. If one considered a tight complex of molecules, the same equations would hold as long as the complex did not have internal symmetry (complexes with internal symmetry show a different average contact number). Finally the category of heterogeneity is quite broad, and there are some situations, such as with segmental flexibility where these equations may be invalid. For example, in the case of two rigid domains connected by a flexible linker, one would have to consider the possibility that one domain could be fixed relative to the other with a single appropriate contact. Another aspect of variational crystallization, the use of multiple variants of the same protein, also increases the probability of crystal formation. In this case, the overall probability of crystallization is exponentially related to the number of variants. Assuming independence of variants (a reasonable assumption with different protein ligands; not as valid with minor changes) with n variants and a probability of crystallization for each variant of p i, the overall probabilit"

However, the role of these kinases is unclear. Using specific chemical inhibitors for MEK and p38, we demonstrate here that both ERK and p38 pathways are critically involved in the transduction of a proliferative signal and cooperate in G-CSF-induced cell proliferation. We show that, like ERK and JNK activation, activation of p38 and its downstream substrate MAP kinase-activated protein kinase 2 by interleukin-3 or G-CSF requires Ras activation. We demonstrate that two distinct cytoplasmic regions of the G-CSF receptor are involved in activation of the p38 pathway: a region within the 100 membrane-proximal amino acids is sufficient to induce low levels of p38 and MAP kinase-activated protein kinase 2 activation, whereas the membrane-distal phosphorylation site Tyr763 mediates strong activation of these kinases. The levels of p38 activation correlate closely with those of Ras activation by G-CSF, suggesting that the degree of Ras activation is a critical determinant for the extent of p38 activation by hemopoietic cytokines.

Cobb M.H. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 180-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (2286) Google Scholar). In mammalian cells, three parallel MAP kinase pathways have been identified. The ERK pathway is activated in response to signals from cell surface receptors and has been shown to regulate both cell proliferation and differentiation, depending on the cell context (2Marshall C.J. Cell. 1995; 80: 179-185Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4236) Google Scholar). In contrast, p38 and JNK pathways are primarily activated by cellular stress signals such as proinflammatory cytokines, heat shock, or UV light and have therefore also been described as “stress-activated protein kinases” (3Cohen P. Trends Cell Biol. 1997; 7: 353-360Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar). However, activation of p38 and JNK pathways is not limited to a cellular stress response, since they can also be potently activated by hemopoietic cytokines (4Rausch O. Marshall C.J. Mol. Cell.

Craxton M. Jakes R. Cohen P. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3563-3571Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar). p38α and p38β are the most homologous of this class of MAP kinases and are both inhibited by the pyridine-imidazoles SB 203580 and SB 202190, whereas the γ and δ isoforms are insensitive to these compounds (16Kumar S.

MAP kinases (MAPKs) are activated by phosphorylation on Thr and Tyr by dual-specificity MAPK kinases (MAPKKs), which are themselves activated by MAPKK kinases (MAPKKKs). In addition, small GTPases acting upstream of MAPKKKs are critically involved in the regulation of mammalian MAPK pathways. For example, activation of ERKs requires activation of Ras and concomitant activation of Raf family kinases such as Raf-1, A-Raf, or B-Raf, which in turn phosphorylate and activate the dual specificity kinase MEK. MEK then phosphorylates ERKs on Thr and Tyr, resulting in ERK activation (22Marshall C.J. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1994; 4: 82-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (899) Google Scholar). Dual specificity kinases that activate JNK are MKK4/SEK-1 (23Derijard B. Raingeaud J. Barrett T. Wu I.H. Han J.H. Ulevitch R.J. Davis R.J.

Raingeaud J. Davis R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1741-1748Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar, 28Raingeaud J. Whitmarsh A.J. Barrett T. Derijard B. Davis R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1247-1255Crossref PubMed Scopus (1147) Google Scholar). In addition, various MAPKKKs for JNK and p38 pathways have been described, such as MEKKs, PAK1, GCK, MLKs, MUK/DLK, MKK5, and ASK1 (reviewed in Ref. 29Fanger G.R. Gerwins P. Widmann C. Jarpe M.B. Johnson G.L. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1997; 7: 67-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar), most of which are capable of activating both pathways. There is strong evidence that the small GTPases Rac and Cdc42 are involved in the regulation of JNK and p38 pathways (30Coso O.A. Chiariello M. Yu J.C. Teramoto H. Crespo P. Xu N. Miki T. Gutkind J.S. Cell. 1995; 81: 1137-1146Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1567) Google Scholar, 31Bagrodia S. Derijard B. Davis R.J. Cerione R.A. J. Biol.

Cell. 1995; 81: 1147-1157Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1446) Google Scholar), although their ultimate relationship with MAPKKKs remains poorly understood. Experiments with dominant negative Ras have shown that activation of the JNK pathway by growth factor receptors and hemopoietic cytokine receptors also requires signaling via Ras (4Rausch O. Marshall C.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1170-1179Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 5Terada K. Kaziro Y. Satoh T. J. Biol.

Cell. 1995; 81: 1147-1157Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1446) Google Scholar). We and others have previously shown that hemopoietic cytokines act as potent activators of JNK and p38 pathways (4Rausch O. Marshall C.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1170-1179Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 5Terada K. Kaziro Y. Satoh T. J. Biol.

Chem. 1997; 272: 15023-15027Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). However, the role of these pathways in hemopoietic cell signaling is, like that of ERKs, unclear. Activation of Ras and the ERK pathway had been suggested to mediate a survival signal rather than cell proliferation (33Kinoshita T. Yokota T. Arai K. Miyajima A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 266-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar, 34Terada K. Kaziro Y. Satoh T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27880-27886Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). However, experiments with dominant negative and constitutively active versions of MEK indicated a role for ERK in cell proliferation (35Perkins G.R. Marshall C.J. Collins M.K.L. Blood. 1996; 87: 3669-3675Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In order to gain further insight into the role and regulation of MAP kinase pathways during hemopoietic cell proliferation, we are studying signaling via the G-CSF receptor as a model system. G-CSF stimulates proliferation and survival of early hemopoietic progenitor cells and induces differentiation of myeloid precursor cells into mature neutrophils (36Demetri D. Griffin J.D. Blood. 1991; 78: 2791-2808Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, it can also act as a strong proliferative signal on myeloid leukemia cell lines such as NFS-60 (37Holmes K.L. Palaszynski E. Fredrickson T.N. Morse H.C. Ihle J.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 6687-6691Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) and was shown to be produced as an autocrine growth factor in some types of acute myeloid leukemia (38Russell N.H. Hunter A.E. Bradbury D. Zhu Y.M. Keith F. Leuk. Lymphoma. 1995; 16: 223-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The G-CSF receptor is a 130-kDa transmembrane protein that forms a homodimer upon ligand binding (39Fukunaga R. Ishizaka-Ikeda E. Seto Y. Nagata S. Cell. 1990; 61: 341-350Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). The cytoplasmic domain contains four conserved tyrosine residues (Tyr703, Tyr728, Tyr743, and Tyr763) that are targets of tyrosine phosphorylation (40Yoshikawa A. Murakami H. Nagata S. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5288-5296Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Although some of these tyrosines have been shown to mediate specific differentiation pathways (40Yoshikawa A. Murakami H. Nagata S. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5288-5296Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 41Nicholson S.E. Starr R. Novak U. Hilton D.J. Layton J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26947-26953Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), none is essential for the induction of a proliferative response (42de Koning J.P. Schelen A.M. Dong F. van Buitenen C. Burgering B. Bos J.L. Lowenberg B. Touw I.P. Blood. 1996; 87: 132-140Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, we have previously shown that Tyr763 is required for activation of JNK, as well as for high levels of Shc and Ras activation, during a proliferative response to G-CSF (4Rausch O. Marshall C.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1170-1179Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). We show here that a proliferative response to G-CSF is strongly associated with activation of p38 and its downstream substrate MAPKAP-K2. We demonstrate that activation of the p38 pathway by G-CSF is Ras-dependent and involves two regions of the G-CSF receptor that are also involved in Ras activation: a membrane-proximal region, which is sufficient to induce low levels of p38 activation, and Tyr763, which is required for strong activation of the p38 pathway. Finally, we present evidence that ERK and p38 pathways cooperate in G-CSF-induced cell proliferation and that the low level of activation mediated by the membrane-proximal region of the receptor is sufficient to mediate the proliferative effect of p38. NFS-60 cells were obtained from Dr. James Ihle. BaF3 cells were obtained from Dr. Mary Collins. N6 cells were a kind gift from Dr. Takaya Satoh and Dr. Yoshito Kaziro. BaF3 and NFS-60 cells were grown in RPMI 1640 medium, including 10% WEHI3 conditioned medium as a source of IL-3, 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum, and 4 mml-glutamine. All cells were kept at cell densities below 1 × 106 cells/ml in a humidified atmosphere at 37 °C (5% CO2). Wild-type BaF3 cells are unresponsive to G-CSF in all of the assays described in this paper. The cDNA for the murine G-CSF receptor was kindly donated by Dr. Shigekazu Nagata in the mammalian expression vector pEFBOS (pEFBOS I62). G-CSF receptor cDNAs harboring C-terminal deletions and Tyr to Phe substitutions were generated by polymerase chain reaction, cloned in pEFBOS, and stably transfected into BaF3 cells by electroporation, and cell lines were selected as described previously (4Rausch O. Marshall C.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1170-1179Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Isolated cell clones were examined for expression of G-CSF receptors by cross-linking with 125I-labeled G-CSF (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and bis(sulfosuccinimidyl)suberate (Pierce) (4Rausch O. Marshall C.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1170-1179Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) In all assays described here, at least two independently isolated cell clones were tested for each receptor construct. Recombinant human G-CSF was a generous gift from Roche Pharmaceuticals UK. Recombinant murine IL-3 was purchased from NBS Biologicals. MAPKAP-K2 antiserum was a gift from Prof. Philip Cohen. ERK2 polyclonal rabbit antiserum 122 was generated against a C-terminal ERK2 peptide (43Leevers S.J. Marshall C.J. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 569-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar). Phosphospecific p38 antibody was purchased from New England Biolabs, and monoclonal p38 antibody was purchased from Zymed Laboratories Inc. SB 203580 p38 inhibitor and SKF 105809 control compound were a gift from Drs. Peter Young and John Lee (SmithKline Beecham Pharmaceuticals). PD 98059 MEK inhibitor was a gift from Dr. Alan Saltiel (Parke Davis Pharmaceuticals). For kinase assays, 0.5–1 × 107 cells were washed twice with RPMI 1640 to remove WEHI3 conditioned medium and were resuspended in RPMI 1640, 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum, 4 mml-glutamine at a density of 5 × 106cells/ml. Cells were then returned to 37 °C (5% CO2) for 4 h. IL-3, G-CSF, and anisomycin (Sigma) were diluted in RPMI 1640 prior to stimulation and were added to cells to a final concentration of 20 ng/ml IL-3, 50 ng/ml G-CSF, or 10 μg/ml anisomycin or as otherwise stated in the figure legends. Stimulation was stopped by washing the cells once in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, 100 μm Na3VO4. For ERK2 and MAPKAP-K2 assays, cells were lysed in 1 ml of IP buffer (50 mm Tris·HCl, pH 7.0, 1% Nonidet P-40, 150 mmNaCl, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 5 mm NaF, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin). For JNK assays, cells were lysed in 1 ml of JNK lysis buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 8.0, 75 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, 20 mm β-glycerophosphate, 0.05% Triton X-100, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin). Cell lysis was performed on a shaking platform at 4 °C for 30 min. Cell debris and nuclei were removed by centrifugation at 12,000 × g. After protein concentration of cell lysates was determined by Bradford protein assay (Bio-Rad), lysates were immediately assayed for kinase activity or stored at −70 °C. For Western blot analysis of tyrosine-phosphorylated p38 MAP kinase, 2 × 106 cells were cytokine-deprived and stimulated at a cell density of 1 × 106 cells/ml as described above. Cells were then lysed directly in 200 μl of SDS-sample buffer (80 mm Tris, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 10% glycerol, 100 μm dithiothreitol, 0.02% bromphenol blue), sonicated 3 times for 1 min each in a Misonix XL waterbath sonicator to shear the DNA, and analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). In the case of N6-WT cells, prior to cytokine removal, cells were induced for 12 h with 5 mm IPTG to allow expression of Ras mutants (34Terada K. Kaziro Y. Satoh T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27880-27886Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Control cells were uninduced. After cytokine removal, induced cells were kept in 5 mm IPTG until lysis. Treatment with IPTG had no effect on parental BaF3 cells or BaF3 cells expressing G-CSF receptors. In order to assay endogenous MAPKAP-K2 activity, MAPKAP-K2 was immunoprecipitated, and the immunoprecipitates were subjected to an in vitro kinase assay. 300 μg of total cell lysate or the amount stated in the figure legends was immunoprecipitated on a revolving wheel at 4 °C for 1.5 h with 1 μg of MAPKAP-K2 antibody prebound to 20 μl of protein G-Sepharose. Immunoprecipitates were then washed three times with HBIB buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 8.0, 0.05% Triton X-100, 50 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, 100 μmNa3VO4) and once with kinase buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 8.0, 20 mm MgCl2, 20 mm β-glycerophosphate). The washed immunoprecipitates were incubated with 30 μl of kinase buffer, including 10 μm ATP (Sigma), 30 μm MAPKAP-K2 peptide substrate (KKLNRTLSVA) (44Stokoe D. Campbell D.G. Nakielny S. Hidaka H. Leevers S.J. Marshall C.J. Cohen P. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3985-3994Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar), and 66 μCi/ml [γ-32P]ATP (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) at 30 °C for 30 min. The reaction was stopped by spotting 20 μl of the reaction onto P81 paper (Whatman), which was subsequently washed five times with 75 mmorthophosphoric acid. Myelin basic protein kinase activity was quantified by counting P81 papers in a Cerenkov counter. For ERK2 assays, ERK2 was immunoprecipitated, and kinase activity was assayed on myelin basic protein as a substrate as described previously (4Rausch O. Marshall C.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1170-1179Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). JNK activity was assayed in a “pull-down” kinase assay employing recombinant GST-Jun-(1–131) as described (4Rausch O. Marshall C.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1170-1179Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of GST-Jun was quantitated on a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager, using ImageQuant software. For p38 Western blot analysis, 40 μl of cell lysate in SDS sample buffer were analyzed on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Gels were subsequently transferred to nitrocellulose, which was then blocked for at least 2 h in 5% fat-free dried milk in Tris-buffered saline, 0.5% Tween 20 (Sigma) (TBST). The blocked nitrocellulose was probed with antiphospho-p38 antibody (New England Biolabs, 1:1000) in TBST for 2 h at room temperature, washed in TBST, and further incubated for 1 h with horseradish peroxidase-coupled secondary antibody (Pierce). Proteins were visualized by ECL (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). To detect the total amount of p38 MAP kinase, nitrocellulose membranes were stripped and reprobed with monoclonal anti-p38 antibody (1:1000,Zymed Laboratories Inc.). Induction of cell proliferation was assayed by measuring incorporation of [3H]thymidine during DNA synthesis. Long term proliferation was measured by assaying cell growth over a 5-day period. For thymidine uptake experiments, cells were washed once with RPMI 1640 to remove cytokine and were then incubated at a density of 1 × 105 cells/ml in RPMI 1640, 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum, 4 mml-glutamine at 37 °C for 6 h. Cells were then stimulated with IL-3 to a final concentration of 10 ng/ml or with G-CSF as indicated in the figure legends and plated in 96-well plates at a volume of 200 μl/well. In case of pretreatment of cells with chemical inhibitors, cells were pretreated with 10 μm SB 203580 or 30 μm PD 98059 or the concentration stated in the figure legends or with the equivalent amount of solvent (Me2SO) as a control. 24 h after cytokine stimulation, 20 μl of RPMI 1640, 10% fetal calf serum containing 1 μl of [methyl-3H]thymidine (1 mCi/ml; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) were added, and the cells were incubated for a further 16 h. Cells were then harvested with a Dynatech cell harvester on grade 934-AH filter paper (Whatman), and the filters were dried, mixed with 2 ml of scintillation liquid (Emulsifier-Safe, Packard), and counted in a scintillation counter. Long term cell proliferation was examined by assaying the growth of individual cell clones over 5 days. Cells were counted using a Coulter Counter (Coulter Electronics Ltd.). Cell proliferation of individual cell clones in response to G-CSF was compared with cell proliferation observed in response to IL-3 as an internal standard. To monitor cell proliferation, cells were plated in 10-ml tissue culture flasks (Nunc) at 1 × 105 cells/ml. Unless otherwise stated, cells were maintained at cell densities below 1 × 106throughout the monitored time. Cells were counted after initial plating and then every 24 h until the end of the experiment. The increase in cell numbers was then related to the initial number of cells plated. We have previously shown that hemopoietic cytokines such as G-CSF and IL-3 strongly activate ERK and JNK MAP kinases in cytokine-deprived hemopoietic cells (4Rausch O. Marshall C.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1170-1179Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). In order to test whether cytokine stimulation also results in activation of the p38 MAP kinase pathway, first we examined G-CSF-induced activation of MAPKAP-K2, a downstream target of p38 (13Rouse J. Cohen P. Trigon S. Morange M. Alonso-Llamazares A. Zamanillo D. Hunt T. Nebreda A.R. Cell. 1994; 78: 1027-1037Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1503) Google Scholar), in the pre-B precursor cell line BaF3 (45Palacios R. Steinmetz M. Cell. 1985; 41: 727-734Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (584) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1 A). MAPKAP-K2 activity in cytokine-deprived BaF3 cells expressing wild-type G-CSF receptors (BaF3-WT) (4Rausch O. Marshall C.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1170-1179Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) was low. In contrast, stimulation of these cells with G-CSF resulted in strong activation of MAPKAP-K2 with a peak of activity at 5 min poststimulation. MAPKAP-K2 activity remained sustained on a lower level up to 2 h poststimulation and, in addition, was found to be elevated in cycling cells. Activation of p38 requires phosphorylation on Thr180 and Tyr182 (11Lee J.C. Laydon J.T. McDonnell P.C. Gallagher T.F. Kumar S. Green D. McNulty D. Blumenthal M.J. Heys J.R. Landvatter S.W.

Ulevitch R.J. Science. 1994; 265: 808-811Crossref PubMed Scopus (2413) Google Scholar), and can be assayed directly using specific antibodies to the phosphorylated form of p38. Western blotting revealed that, similar to MAPKAP-K2 activation, p38 phosphorylation peaked at 5 min after G-CSF stimulation (Fig. 1 B). Consistent with the sustained activation of MAPKAP-K2 after G-CSF-treatment, phosphorylation of p38 persisted for at least 2 h following G-CSF stimulation, suggesting that the maintenance of MAPKAP-K2 activity requires concomitant activation of p38. p38 was also found to be more highly phosphorylated in cycling cells than in cytokine-deprived cells. Stimulation of cells with IL-3 showed a similar time course of MAPKAP-K2 activation to that observed for G-CSF (data not shown). The duration of p38 activation by G-CSF is very similar to that of ERK activation but unlike that of JNK, which is switched off completely within 1 h of stimulation and is inactive in cycling cells (4Rausch O. Marshall C.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1170-1179Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). To confirm that MAPKAP-K2 activation requires p38 function in vivo, cytokine-deprived BaF3-WT cells were pretreated with a highly specific chemical inhibitor for p38, SB 203580 (11Lee J.C. Laydon J.T. McDonnell P.C. Gallagher T.F. Kumar S. Green D. McNulty D. Blumenthal M.J. Heys J.R. Landvatter S.W. Strickler J.E. McLaughlin M.M. Siemens I.R. Fisher S.M. Livi G.P. White J.R. Adams J.L. Young P.R. Nature. 1994; 372: 739-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (3138) Google Scholar), prior to stimulation (Fig. 2 A). The results show that MAPKAP-K2 activation by IL-3 or G-CSF, as well as by a stress-signal such as anisomycin, is totally dependent on p38 function, demonstrating that MAPKAP-K2 activation reflects p38 activation in vivo. SB 203580 treatment had no effect on cytokine-induced activation of JNK and ERK MAP kinases (data not shown). Activation of p38 by G-CSF was also observed in the myeloid leukemia cell line NFS-60 (Fig. 3 B,top right), indicating that activation by growth-promoting cytokines is a common event in hemopoietic cells. Taken together, our experiments demonstrate rapid and sustained activation of the p38 MAP kinase pathway by hemopoietic cytokines. Comparison of p38 activation with ERK and JNK activation reveals that both ERK and p38 MAP kinase pathways are similarly regulated during cytokine-induced hemopoietic cell proliferation. In order to investigate the potential role of receptor tyrosine phosphorylation in G-CSF signaling, we have established a series of BaF3 cell lines stably expressing G-CSF receptor point and deletion mutants. Experiments with these cells have shown that activation of JNK required Tyr763 of the receptor, whereas activation of ERK was independent of this residue (4Ra"

We now address the potential role of biosynthetic cargo in modulating COPII coat assembly and vesicle budding. The ER accumulation of vesicular stomatitis glycoprotein (VSV-G), a transmembrane protein, or the soluble PiZ variant of α1-antitrypsin, reduced levels of general COPII vesicle formation in vivo. Consistent with this result, conditions that prevent the export of VSV-G from the ER led to a significant inhibition of general COPII vesicle budding from ER microsomes and the export of an endogenous recycling protein p58in vitro. In contrast, synchronized export of VSV-G stimulated COPII vesicle budding both in vivo and in vitro. Under conditions where VSV-G is retained in the ER, we find that it can to be recovered in pre-budding complexes containing COPII components. These results suggest that the export of biosynthetic cargo is integrated with ER functions involved in protein folding and oligomerization. The ability of biosynthetic cargo to prevent or enhance ER export suggests that interactions of cargo with the COPII machinery contribute to the formation of vesicles budding from the ER.

Incorporation into vesicles is dependent on protein folding, a process that is stringently monitored by the ER (3Hurtley S.M. Helenius A. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1989; 5: 277-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (773) Google Scholar). During export, biosynthetic cargo is sorted from resident ER proteins and selected for incorporation into vesicles by interacting with the Sar1 and Sec23/24 components of the COPII coat prior to vesicle formation (4Aridor M. Weissman J. Bannykh S. Nouffer C. Balch W.E. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 61-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar, 5Kuehn M.J. Herrmann M. Schekman R. Nature. 1998; 391: 187-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). Subsequently, the selected cargo incorporated into these pre-budding complexes is packaged into vesicles upon addition of the Sec13/31 complex. Because both membrane-associated proteins and soluble cargo proteins become physically associated with a pre-budding complex prior to export, it becomes important to determine whether biosynthetic cargo or cargo receptors can regulate vesicle coat assembly (4Aridor M. Weissman J. Bannykh S. Nouffer C. Balch W.E. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 61-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar, 5Kuehn M.J. Herrmann M. Schekman R. Nature. 1998; 391: 187-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar), thereby linking cargo sorting to vesicle formation from the ER. A role for cargo in directing vesicle formation was previously observed in both the late secretory pathway and the endocytic pathway (reviewed in Ref. 6Schmid S.L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 511-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (669) Google Scholar). The transferrin receptor contains sorting determinants that are capable of interacting with the AP-2 complex that mediates clathrin-dependent endocytosis from the plasma membrane (reviewed in Ref. 7Bonifacino J.S. Marks M.S. Ohno H. Kirchhausen T. Proc. Assoc. Am. Physicians. 1996; 4: 285-295Google Scholar). Overexpression of transferrin leads to increased AP-2/clathrin coat recruitment to the plasma membrane and clathrin-coated endocytic vesicle formation (8Iacopetta B.J. Rothenberger S. Kühn L.C. Cell. 1988; 54: 485-489Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 9Millar K. Shipman M. Trowbridge I.S. Hopkins C.R. Cell. 1991; 65: 621-632Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Cargo proteins and cargo receptors in the trans-Golgi network (TGN), including mannose 6-phosphate receptors and the major histocompatibility class II protein complex, contain sorting determinants that are capable of binding to the AP-1 adaptor complex (7Bonifacino J.S. Marks M.S. Ohno H. Kirchhausen T. Proc. Assoc. Am. Physicians. 1996; 4: 285-295Google Scholar). The AP-1 complex mediates clathrin-dependent export of these proteins from the TGN (10Le Borgne R.

Chem. 1996; 271: 30318-30321Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Overexpression or elimination of these cargo proteins affects both AP-1 coat recruitment and clathrin-coated vesicle formation. To determine whether cargo exported from the ER is capable of modulating COPII vesicle formation, we have taken advantage of vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV)-infected cells to control biosynthetic cargo availability. VSV-infected cells express a single surface glycoprotein, VSV-G. The transport of both the wild-type and a mutant form of VSV-G, strain tsO45, has been extensively utilized to define the basic biochemical components and principles of operation of the secretory pathway (reviewed in Refs. 2Aridor M. Balch W.E. Trends Cell Biol. 1996; 6: 315-320Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 13Rothman J.E.

Trends Cell Biol. 1998; 8: 21-25Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). In particular, tsO45 VSV-G (VSV-Gts) accumulates in the ER due to a temperature-sensitive folding defect at the restrictive temperature of 39.5 °C. Upon shift to the permissive temperature (32 °C) folding resumes, allowing us to synchronize exit from the ER. The ability to synchronize movement of VSV-Gts has played an important role in defining the normal folding intermediates associated with the molecular chaperones calnexin and BiP preceding ER export (15Hammond C. Helenius A. Science. 1994; 266: 456-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar, 16De Silva A.M. Balch W.E. Helenius A. J.

Helenius A. Curr. Biol. 1995; 7: 523-529Crossref Scopus (586) Google Scholar). In addition, because host protein synthesis is blocked following VSV infection of cells, VSV-Gts is the major glycoprotein transiting the secretory pathway. Therefore, VSV-Gts allows us to follow the effects of a single well defined biosynthetic cargo molecule on COPII recruitment and vesicle budding when it has accumulated in the ER as a folding intermediate or when it is subsequently matured to the folded state for transport (4Aridor M. Weissman J. Bannykh S. Nouffer C. Balch W.E. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 61-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar,19Aridor M. Bannykh S.I. Rowe T. Balch W.E. J.

Nature. 1997; 389: 81-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). We have now applied a variety of techniques to monitor the effect of biosynthetic cargo on vesicle budding from secretory compartments. These include the following: (i) quantitative stereology to follow membrane flow at the ultra-structural level in vivo (24Bannykh S.I. Rowe T. Balch W.E. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 19-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar), (ii) biochemical assays to monitor ER vesicle budding in vitro (25Rowe T. Aridor M. McCaffery J.M. Plutner H. Balch W.E. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 895-911Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar), (iii) an assay to monitor the interactions of cargo with COPII components in the ER prior to vesicle formation (4Aridor M. Weissman J. Bannykh S. Nouffer C. Balch W.E. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 61-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar), and (iv) an assay that allows us to follow the recruitment of COPI components to downstream pre-Golgi and Golgi compartments that may be affected by export from the ER. The effects of availability of a membrane-bound cargo molecule such as VSV-G on ER export was also compared with that of an endogenous soluble cargo molecule, the PiZ variant of α1-antitrysin (PiZ) (26Sifers R.N.

Biol. 1995; 2: 355-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) which accumulates in the ER under pathophysiological conditions. We now demonstrate that cargo can prevent and enhance COPII vesicle budding in vivo andin vitro. Furthermore, we show that VSV-G held in the ER interacts with the Sar1 and Sec23/24 components of the COPII machinery. We propose that the observed coupling between cargo and COPII components can modulate the formation of pre-budding intermediates that are essential for vesicle formation from the ER. Calphostin C, Roche 31-8220, staurosporine, and phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate were obtained from Calbiochem. Calphostin C was made fresh every 2 weeks. Both reagents were added from stock solutions in dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO). Digitonin was obtained from Wako BioProducts (Richmond, VA). Endoglycosidase H was obtained from Boehringer Mannheim. GS beads were obtained from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Other antibodies used in this study were generous gifts from the following laboratories: a polyclonal antibody against Sec23p from R. Schekman, University of California, Berkeley (Berkeley, CA); a polyclonal antibody against p58 from J. Saraste, University of Bergen (Oslo, Norway); a monoclonal antibody to VSV-G from T.

Kreis, University of Geneva (Geneva, Switzerland); and an anti-peptide antibody against β-COP (EAGE) from M. Farquhar (University of California, San Diego, CA). A polyclonal antibody specific for VSV-G was described previously (22Plutner H. Davidson H.W. Saraste J. Balch W.E. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 1097-1116Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). A polyclonal antibody to Sec23 was generated against a peptide (DTEHGGSQAR) (residues 707–716) or against recombinant GST-Sec23 as described (4Aridor M. Weissman J. Bannykh S. Nouffer C. Balch W.E.

Measurement of the basic cell morphometric parameters, the number of ER and Golgi-derived budding profiles, and the number and size of pre-Golgi intermediates were determined as described (24Bannykh S.I. Rowe T. Balch W.E. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 19-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar) Recombinant Sar1 and GST-Sec23 proteins utilized in this study were prepared as described (4Aridor M. Weissman J. Bannykh S. Nouffer C. Balch W.E. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 61-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). Normal rat kidney (NRK) cells were infected with VSV as described (22Plutner H. Davidson H.W. Saraste J. Balch W.E. J.

Briefly, cells were infected at a multiplicity of 10–20 plaque-forming units with wild-type or the tsO45 strain of vesicular stomatitis virus (21Beckers C.J.M. Keller D.S. Balch W.E. Cell. 1987; 50: 523-534Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar) for 4 h at the restrictive temperature. For measurement of transport in vivo, protocols were as described under “Results” and in the figure legends. For measurement of transport in vitro, preparation of cell homogenates was as described (25Rowe T. Aridor M. McCaffery J.M. Plutner H. Balch W.E. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 895-911Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). COPII vesicle formation reactions using NRK microsomes were performed and budding quantitated using antibodies specific for Sec23, p58, and VSV-G using Western blotting (25Rowe T. Aridor M. McCaffery J.M. Plutner H. Balch W.E. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 895-911Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). To enhance preservation of the temperature-sensitive phenotype observedin vivo, in some experiments (see “Results”), 1 mm dithiothreitol was added to cells during the final 15 min of incubation at 39.5 °C. Cells were harvested, washed, and homogenized in the presence of 1 mm dithiothreitol. Subsequently, membranes were washed twice in transport buffer lacking dithiothreitol prior to freezing as described(25). 150-mm dishes of NRK cells were washed three times with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and scraped with rubber policeman in a buffer containing 10 mm Hepes (pH 7.2) and 250 mm mannitol (buffer A). The cells were pelleted, resuspended in buffer A, and homogenized by passing the cell suspension 6 times through a ball bearing homogenizer (31Balch W.E. Rothman J.E. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1985; 240: 413-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). A post-nuclear supernatant was prepared by centrifuging the homogenate at 1000 ×g for 10 min at 4 °C. 15 μl (20–40 μg protein) of post-nuclear supernatant was added to a transport reaction mixture containing 27.5 mm Hepes-KOH (pH 7.2), 2.5 mmMgOAc, 65 mm KOAc, 5 mm EGTA, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 1 mm ATP, 5 mm creatine phosphate, 0.2 units of rabbit muscle creatine kinase (final concentrations), and 1.5–2 mg/ml rat liver cytosol in a final volume of 200 μl on ice. The tubes were then transferred to 32 °C for 5–20 min as indicated under “Results.” The reaction was terminated by transfer to ice. 1 ml of a buffer containing 25 mm Hepes (pH 7.2), 2.5 mm MgOAc, and KOAc to give the final salt concentration as indicated under “Results” was added, and the tubes were vortexed and centrifuged at 16,000 ×g for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was aspirated, and the tubes were centrifuged for an additional 3 min at 16,000 ×g at 4 °C. The residual supernatant was removed and 25 μl of a gel sample buffer (32Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205498) Google Scholar) added. Samples were heated for 5 min at 95 °C and resolved using SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (32Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205498) Google Scholar) on 7.5 or 10% polyacrylamide gels. β-COP was detected by immunoblotting using the M3A5 monoclonal antibody specific for β-COP and developed with alkaline phosphatase (33Duden R. Griffiths G. Frank R. Argos P. Kreis T.E. Cell. 1991; 64: 649-665Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar, 34Pepperkok R. Scheel J. Horstmann H. Hauri H.P. Griffiths G. Kreis T.E. Cell. 1993; 74: 71-82Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). β-COP was quantitated by densitometry using a Molecular Dynamics Densitometer (Sunnyvale, CA). Isolation of the pre-budding complex with GST-Sec23 was performed as described (4Aridor M. Weissman J. Bannykh S. Nouffer C. Balch W.E. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 61-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). An ER-derived bud is defined as an elevation on the surface of the ER with a width of 60–80 nm that is extruded by 50% of its diameter and covered with a characteristic coat on the external leaflet of the membrane (24Bannykh S.I. Rowe T. Balch W.E. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 19-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar) (Fig.1 A, asterisks) (see “Experimental Procedures”). Such buds are found in specialized sites of the ER referred to as “transitional regions” near the Golgi (35Palade G.E. Science. 1975; 189: 347-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (2313) Google Scholar) or “export complexes” found in the peripheral cytoplasm (24Bannykh S.I. Rowe T. Balch W.E. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 19-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). To assess the effect of cargo on ER export in vivo, we examined whether the number of buds found on the ER surface can be modulated by biosynthetic cargo using electron microscopy and quantitative stereology. To validate this approach, we first determined the effect of reagents that block general protein export from the ER. We have previously established using biochemical approaches that both calphostin C and okadaic acid (OKA) are potent inhibitors of the export of the type 1 transmembrane protein vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein (VSV-G) from the ER, whereas phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate is stimulatory (36Davidson H.W.

Chem. 1994; 269: 26848-26857Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The effects of these reagents on the formation of ER buds as assessed by quantitative morphometry paralleled those seen in previous biochemical assays. In control cells, we detected on average 248 ± 25 buds per cell at steady state. Treatment of cells with OKA reduced by >95% the number of budding structures on the ER (12 ± 5 buds per cells). This result is similar to the recently reported morphological effects of OKA on export of the pre-Golgi intermediate marker protein p53/58 from the ER (38Pryde J.G. Farmaki T. Lucocq J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1125-1135Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Calphostin C led to an 85% reduction (40 ± 10 buds per cell, respectively), whereas phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate treatment resulted in a 2-fold increase in their number (480 ± 11). Changes in ER export also led to corresponding alterations in the abundance and size of downstream pre-Golgi intermediates. These structures are composed morphologically of clusters of vesicles and tubules (Fig.1 A, arrowheads) (20Balch W.E. McCaffery J.M. Plutner H. Farquhar M.G. Cell. 1994; 76: 841-852Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar, 24Bannykh S.I. Rowe T. Balch W.E. J.

Svensson K. J. Cell Sci. 1991; 100: 415-430Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (see “Experimental Procedures”). In the absence of inhibitors, cells contained on average 67 ± 7 pre-Golgi intermediates at steady state. This value was reduced to 4 ± 1 and 14 ± 4 in the presence of OKA and calphostin C, respectively. By having established that the number of ER buds scored by quantitative morphometry serves as a reliable measure of protein and membrane flow from the ER through the secretory pathway, we next followed the effect of a single biosynthetic cargo species on ER export. For this purpose, we infected cells with the tsO45 strain of vesicular stomatitis virus (VSVts) which encodes a temperature-sensitive mutant of the type 1 transmembrane surface glycoprotein VSV-G (VSV-Gts). When expressed at the restrictive temperature (39.5 °C), VSV-Gts accumulates in the ER due to a folding defect (41Lafay F. J. Virol. 1974; 14: 1220-1228Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Accumulation in the ER at 39.5 °C is not a consequence of aggregation as VSV-Gts is freely diffusible (42Storrie B. Pepperkok R. Stelzer E.H. Kreis T.E. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 1309-1319PubMed Google Scholar). Because virus infection inhibits host protein synthesis (43Dunigan D.D. Lucas-Lenard J.M. J. Virol. 1983; 45: 618-626Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), this approach allows us to simultaneously reduce endogenous biosynthetic cargo and introduce a single major cargo species into the ER. Upon shift to the permissive temperature (32 °C), VSV-Gts exits the ER via COPII vesicular carriers (19Aridor M. Bannykh S.I. Rowe T. Balch W.E. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 875-893Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar, 21Beckers C.J.M. Keller D.S. Balch W.E. Cell. 1987; 50: 523-534Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar, 22Plutner H. Davidson H.W. Saraste J. Balch W.E. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 1097-1116Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar, 25Rowe T. Aridor M. McCaffery J.M. Plutner H. Balch W.E. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 895-911Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). If the availability of cargo for export can influence the formation of COPII-derived vesicular carriers in vivo, then we should detect differences between the number of ER buds and downstream intermediates found at the restrictive and permissive temperatures. We first examined the export of wild-type VSV-G to rule out the trivial concern that viral pathogenesis may interfere in some unexpected way with the appearance of budding structures. Budding activity (as defined by the number of budding profiles per μm2 ER membrane surface) in mock-infected or wild-type-infected cells at 39.5 °C was generally 2–2.5-fold greater than that observed at 32 °C (Fig.1 B). The abundance of pre-Golgi intermediates in mock-infected NRK cells was also greater (∼1.8-fold) at 39.5 °C than at 32 °C (Fig. 1 D, compare lane a tolane c), corresponding to the enhanced level of ER export. Consistent with this result, the rate of processing of wild-type VSV-G oligosaccharides by Golgi-associated enzymes was ∼2.5-fold faster at 39.5 °C than at 32 °C (data not shown). Thus, the transport activities observed in control and wild-type virus-infected cells were comparable, and in both cases, budding activity was temperature-dependent. In contrast to the lack of effects of wild-type VSV-G on budding when compared with mock-infected cells, the number of ER buds in tsO45-infected cells retained at 39.5 °C was nearly 3–4-fold lower (a 65–75% decrease) (Fig. 1 C, lane b) than that observed in mock-infected (Fig. 1 C, lane a) or wild-type VSV-infected cells (Fig. 1 B, lane b). No changes in any of the basic cell morphometric parameters (volume and surface area) were detected under these conditions (not shown). Although the surface area and volume of the ER in tsO45-infected cells held at 39.5 °C increased only slightly (∼5%), we observed an ∼50% reduction in the number of pre-Golgi intermediates (Fig. 1 D, lane b), a 40% (± 5%) decrease in the size of the Golgi stack, and a 60% (± 10%) reduction in the number of Golgi buds relative to mock-infected cells. These results suggest that the reduction in ER budding activity observed in tsO45-infected cells held at 39.5 °C (Fig. 1 C, lane b) results in a corresponding reduction in size and budding activity of downstream organelles. Because export from the ER appears to be sensitive to cargo, we would predict that transfer of tsO45-infected cells to 32 °C should restore budding activity and membrane flow. Indeed, a 5-min shift to 32 °C led to a wave of export activity, with a 1.5-fold increase (Fig. 1 C, lane d) in vesicle budding over that observed in mock-infected cells held at 32 °C (Fig. 1 B, lane c). This wave of export was reflected in a corresponding ∼1.4-fold increase in pre-Golgi intermediates (Fig. 1 D, lane d) and an ∼1.6-fold increase in Golgi size and the number of Golgi-associated buds (not shown). This value returned to the steady-state level seen in control cells within 30 min (Fig. 1 C, lane e). We conclude that a major biosynthetic cargo molecule such as VSV-Gts can affect general membrane flow from the ER by preventing or enhancing ER budding. The effects of VSV-Gts, a transmembrane protein, on export led us to also characterize the potential role of accumulation of an endogenous soluble protein, in this case the human PiZ variant of α1-antitrysin (AATPiZ) (27Sifers R.N. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 355-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Unlike wild-type monomeric α1-antitrypsin (AATwt), which is secreted rapidly from the ER, greater than 85% of the transport-impaired PiZ variant is retained within the ER and is subjected to rapid intracellular degradation (29Le A. Graham K.S. Sifers R.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 14001-14007Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In a subset of PiZ variant carrier patients, the degradation of the protein is markedly reduced leading to its accumulation in the ER (27Sifers R.N. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 355-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). These patients develop severe liver injury, a problem that may potentially reflect a more global deficiency in ER and/or cell function. Interestingly, when we examined isogenic cell lines expressing either the wild-type α1-antitrypsin (ATTwt) or those accumulating the PiZ variant (ATTPiZ), we found an ∼30% decrease in the number of ER buds in the PiZ variant (Fig.2 A, compare lane ato lane e). Thus, steady-state accumulation of ATTPiZ in the ER led to reduced levels of budding profiles. To mimic the more exaggerated long term accumulation of α1-antitrypsin found in PiZ variant patients, we took advantage of previous studies which have demonstrated that ER degradation of the PiZ variant requires protein synthesis (44Le A. Ferrell G.A. Dishon D.S. Le Q.-Q.A. Sifers R.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1072-1080Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Addition of CHX not only prevents degradation of the PiZ variant but also reduces the content of other cargo proteins in the ER. As such, this condition leads to a temporary relative increase in the abundance of polymerized AATPiZ variant in the ER (44Le A. Ferrell G.A. Dishon D.S. Le Q.-Q.A. Sifers R.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1072-1080Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 45Wu Y. Whitman I. Molmenti E. Moore K. Hippenmeyer P. Perlmutter D.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 267: 1072-1080Google Scholar). In addition, incubation of cells in the presence of CHX allows us to examine independently the role of general cargo reduction on ER-budding structures. This is an important control in the case of VSV-infected cells where the virus inhibits host protein synthesis. Previous studies in yeast have shown that CHX treatment does lead to a partial reduction of ER-derived vesicles (46Kaiser C.A. Schekman R. Cell. 1990; 61: 723-733Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (536) Google Scholar). To test first for any potential nonspecific effects of CHX on transport, we examined whether exposure of tsO45 virus-infected cells to CHX for up to 4 h at the restrictive temperature alters the subsequent kinetics of ER to Golgi transport of VSV-Gts at the permissive temperature in the presence of the drug. As shown in Fig. 2 B, VSV-G accumulated at the restrictive temperature for 4.5 h was radiolabeled at 39.5 °C and incubated in the presence of CHX for an additional 4 h prior to transfer to 32 °C. Strikingly, no inhibitory effect was observed compared with the transport kinetics of the control that was not incubated for an additional 4 h in the presence of CHX. A similar lack of eff"

TNF-α is primarily produced by monocytes and T lymphocytes. In particular, T-cell-derived TNF-α plays a critical role in autoimmune inflammation and superantigen-induced septic shock. However, little is known about the intracellular signaling pathways that regulate TNF expression in T cells. Here we show that extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), and p38-mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways control the transcription and synthesis of TNF-α in A3.01 T cells that produce the cytokine upon T cell activation by costimulation with 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) and ionomycin. Selective activation of each of the distinct MAPK pathways by expression of constitutively active kinases is sufficient for TNF-α promoter induction. Furthermore, blockage of all three pathways almost abolishes TPA/ionomycin-induced transcriptional activation of the TNF-α promoter. Selective inhibition of one or more MAPK pathways impairs TNF-α induction by TPA/ionomycin, indicating a cooperation between these signal transduction pathways. Our approach revealed that the MAPK kinase 6 (MKK6)/p38 pathway is involved in both transcriptional and posttranscriptional regulation of TNF expression. Moreover, analysis of the progressive 5′ deletion mutants of the TNF-α promoter indicates that distinct promoter regions are targeted by either ERK-, JNK-, or p38-activating pathways. Thus, unlike what has been reported for other TNF-α-producing cells, all three MAPK pathways are critical and cooperate to regulate transcription of theTNF-α gene in T lymphocytes, suggesting a T-cell-specific regulation of the cytokine.

T lymphocytes produce the cytokine when they are activated via their antigen receptor, and cells of the monocyte/macrophage lineage generate it upon lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulation (1Pauli U. Crit. Rev. Eukaryotic Gene Expression. 1994; 4: 323-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Mast cells also secrete TNF-α after high-affinity IgE receptor aggregation (2Zhang C. Baumgartner R.A. Yamada K. Beaven M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13397-13402Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). TNF-α is among the earliest activated cytokines in inflammation, and its production is crucial for the development of an early defense against many pathogens (reviewed in Ref. 1Pauli U. Crit. Rev. Eukaryotic Gene Expression. 1994; 4: 323-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). However, these beneficial effects of TNF-α are dependent on the strength and duration of its expression. High systemic levels of TNF-α induced by stimulation of T cells with bacterial superantigen (3Miethke T. Wahl C. Heeg K. Echtenacher B. Krammer P.H. Wagner H. J. Exp. Med. 1992; 175: 91-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar) or by LPS stimulation of macrophages (1Pauli U. Crit. Rev. Eukaryotic Gene Expression. 1994; 4: 323-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 4Jongeneel C.V. Prog. Clin. Biol. Res. 1994; 388: 367-381PubMed Google Scholar) cause subsequent septic shock. Furthermore, the critical role of TNF-α in the generation of autoimmune inflammation has been defined by the targeted disruption of the TNF gene (5Körner H. Riminton D.S. Strickland D.H. Lemckert T.A. Pollard J.D. Sedgwick J.D. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 186: 1585-1590Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). In addition to autoimmune diseases (6Taupin V. Renno T. Bourbonniere L. Peterson A.C. Rodriguez M. Owens T. Eur. J. Immunol. 1997; 27: 905-913Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar) and superantigen-induced septic shock (7Kramer B. Machleidt T. Wiegmann K. Kronke M. J. Inflamm. 1995; 45: 183-192PubMed Google Scholar), the pivotal role of T-cell-produced TNF-α in the modulation of inflammatory responses is further reflected in the observation that T-cell membrane-bound TNF-α is of particular importance for the regulation of monocytic interleukin 10 and TNF-α production (8Parry S.L. Sebbag M. Feldmann M. Brennan F.M. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 3673-3681PubMed Google Scholar). The diverse stimuli that up-regulate TNF-α expression in different cells are known to be activators of MAPK-activating signaling pathways. Indeed, in monocytes, macrophages, and mast cells, it was shown that MAPK activation plays a central role in the induced TNF-α expression (2Zhang C. Baumgartner R.A. Yamada K. Beaven M.A. J. Biol.

The family of MAPKs consists of at least three subgroups: (a) the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), (b) the Jun N-terminal kinase, which is also known as stress-activated protein kinase (JNK/SAPK), and (c) the p38 subgroup of MAPKs (for a review, see Ref. 13Robinson M.J. Cobb M.H. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 180-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (2286) Google Scholar). The human homolog of p38 designated CSBP has been identified as the binding protein of the pyridinyl-imidazole compound SB203580 that was shown to have an inhibitory effect on LPS-stimulated TNF-α production by human monocytes (10Lee J.C. Laydon J.T. McDonnell P.C. Gallagher T.F. Kumar S. Green D. McNulty D. Blumenthal M.J. Heys J.R. Landvatter S.W. Strickler J.E. McLaughlin M.M. Siemens I.R. Fisher S.M. Livi G.P. White J.R. Adams J.L. Young P.R. Nature. 1994; 372: 739-746Crossref PubMed Scopus (3147) Google Scholar). JNK and p38 differ from ERK in that they are predominantly regulated by cellular stress inducers and proinflammatory cytokines (14Kyriakis J.M. Banerjee P. Nikolakaki E. Dai T. Rubie E.A. Ahmad M.F.

Whereas in T cells, T cell receptor (TCR) ligation or TPA treatment is sufficient to maximally induce ERK activity, JNK and p38 activation requires a costimulatory signal such as CD28 ligand binding or ionomycin cotreatment, respectively (16Dickens M.

The direct upstream kinase of ERK is MEK, which is regulated via phosphorylation by Raf (19Daum G. Eisenmann-Tappe I. Fries H.-W. Troppmair J. Rapp U.R. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 474-480Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar). JNK is activated by SAPK/ERK kinase (SEK, also known as MKK4) as well as by the recently identified kinase MKK7 (20Fanger G.R. Gerwins P. Widmann C. Jarpe M.B. Johnson G.L. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 67-74Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Google Scholar, 21Holland P.M. Suzanne M. Campbell J.S. Noselli S. Cooper J.A. J. Biol.

A. 1997; 94: 7337-7342Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). The activation of JNK is further controlled by a putative scaffold protein, JNK-interacting protein 1 (JIP-1), which binds to JNK and several other components of the JNK pathway (23Whitmarsh A.J. Cavanagh J. Tournier C. Yasuda J. Davis R.J. Science. 1998; 281: 1671-1674Crossref PubMed Scopus (589) Google Scholar). Overexpression of JIP-1 or the JNK-binding domain of JIP-1 leads to the cytoplasmic retention of JNK and the inhibition of JNK-dependent gene expression (16Dickens M. Rogers J.S. Cavanagh J.

MAPK kinase 6 (MKK6) functions as an activating kinase for all known p38 isoforms (25Han J. Lee J.D. Jiang Y. Li Z. Feng L. Ulevitch R.J. J. Biol.

Until this time, a specific physiological activator of MKK6 has not been identified.

Two findings suggest a cell type-specific involvement of intracellular signaling pathways inducing TNF-α expression: (a) in lymphocytes versus monocytes, different sets of transcription factors are recruited to the promoter of the TNF-α gene (29Zagariya A. Mungre S. Lovis R. Birrer M. Ness S. Thimmapaya B. Pope R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2815-2824Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 30Tsai E.Y. Yie J. Thanos D. Goldfeld A.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5232-5244Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar), and (b) extracellular stimuli with a cell type-specific function trigger TNF-α expression in different cells, such as LPS in monocytes, FcεRI receptor aggregation in mast cells, or activation of the antigenic receptor in T lymphocytes. Antigenic activation of T lymphocytes, which can be mimicked by costimulation with a phorbol ester such as TPA and a calcium ionophore such as ionomycin (for a review, see Ref. 31Rao A. Crit. Rev.

Rao A. J. Exp. Med. 1993; 178: 1365-1379Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). To investigate T-cell-specific regulation of the TNF-α gene, we analyzed the involvement of distinct MAPK pathways in TNF-α transcription and biosynthesis upon activation of the human T-cell line A3.01. We demonstrate that ERK, JNK, and p38 pathways that are activated upon stimulation with TPA and ionomycin (TPA/ionomycin) are critical for and cooperatively contribute to the induction of TNF-α expression in these T cells. A3.01 human T lymphoma cells were grown in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum to a density of 8 × 105 cells/ml. Cells were incubated at 37 °C in humidified air with 7% CO2. Antibodies raised against ERK2 (sc-154), JNK1 (sc-474), and p38 (sc-535) were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. The monoclonal antibodies against the HA tag (12CA5) were produced and purified according to a standard protocol. The TNF-α monoclonal antibody was purchased from PharMingen, Inc. The human TNF-α promoter (−1057/+131; a generous gift of Dr. S. A. Nedospasov, Laboratory of Molecular Immunoregulation, PRI/DynCorp; National Cancer Institute, Frederick Cancer Research and Development Center, MD) was cloned into the HindIII site of pGL3 basic luciferase expression vector (Promega). The diverse 5′ deletion mutants of the TNF-α promoter were produced by restriction digestion or PCR amplification of regions of the human TNF-α promoter from nucleotide +131 relative to the transcriptional start site to various deletion end points described in Fig. 6. The promoter fragments were cloned into the pGL3 basic luciferase expression vector, and successful cloning was confirmed by sequencing. The eukaryotic expression vector for HA-SAPKβ and the prokaryotic expression vector pGEX-KG-c-Jun(1–135) were gifts from J. Kyriakis and L. Zon. The pRSPA vector system was used for the expression of all cDNAs in eukaryotic cells. pRSPA is an expression vector with the Rous sarcoma virus promoter and the simian virus 40 polyadenylation signal region in a pBluescript backbone (33Dorn P.L. DaSilva L. Matarano L. Derse D. J. Virol. 1990; 64: 1616-1624Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The cDNA of MLK3 and the corresponding kinase inactive mutant were kindly provided by K. Gallo and P. Godowski (34Gallo K.A. Mark M.R. Scadden D.T. Wang Z. Gu Q. Godowski P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15092-15100Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Raf-BXB-CX (constitutively active Raf) lacks the N-terminal negative regulatory domain and contains the C-terminal membrane targeting 17 amino acids of Ki-Ras fused to the kinase domain of c-Raf l (18Hoffmeyer A.

The interfering mutants of ERK2, SAPKβ, MKK6, Raf-BXB-CX, and MLK3 are ATP-binding site mutants generated by the replacement of lysine with arginine (ERK2(B3), SAPKβ(K-R), and Raf-BXB-CX375) or alanine (MKK6(A) and MLK3 K144A) (26Raingeaud J.

JIP-1 is a cytoplasmic protein that was identified as a putative scaffold protein that binds to several components of the JNK pathway and regulates JNK activity (23Whitmarsh A.J. Cavanagh J. Tournier C. Yasuda J. Davis R.J. Science. 1998; 281: 1671-1674Crossref PubMed Scopus (589) Google Scholar). Overexpression of JIP-1 or the JNK-binding domain of JIP-1 inhibits JNK activity by causing cytoplasmic retention of JNK that leads to the subsequent inhibition of JNK-regulated gene expression (16Dickens M. Rogers J.S. Cavanagh J. Raintano A. Xia Z. Halpern J.R. Greenberg M.E. Sawyers C.L. Davis R.J. Science. 1997; 277: 693-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (629) Google Scholar). The JIP-1 cDNA used in this study consists of the JNK-binding domain fused to a Flag-Tag and was kindly provided by R. Davies. All cDNAs were subcloned in the pRSPA vector. Cells were split to a density of 4 × 105 cells/ml 1 day before transfection. A DMRIETM-C based transfection protocol was used according to the manufacturer's instructions (Life Technologies). Cells were seeded in 6-well plates (7 × 105cells/well) in 1.5 ml of Opti-MEM (Life Technologies) containing 3 μl of DMRIETM and up to 3 μg of vector DNA. Transfections for luciferase assays were performed with 0.5 μg of reporter construct plus 2 μg of pRSPA containing diverse cDNAs. Unless otherwise indicated, cells in each well were harvested in 100 μl of lysis buffer (50 mmNa-2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acid, pH 7.8, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 10 mm dithiothreitol, and 2% Triton X-100) 24 h after transfection. The crude cell lysates were cleared by centrifugation, and 50 μl of precleared cell extracts were added to 50 μl of luciferase assay buffer (125 mmNa-2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acid, pH 7.8, 125 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 25 mm magnesium acetate, and 2 mg/ml ATP). Immediately after the injection of 50 μl of 1 mmd-luciferin (AppliChem) into each sample, the luminescence was measured for 5 s in a luminometer (Berthold). The luciferase activities were normalized on the basis of protein content as well as on the β-galactosidase activity of cotransfected Rous sarcoma virus LTR β-gal vector. The β-galactosidase assay was performed with 20 μl of precleared cell lysate according to a standard protocol (38Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, New York1989Google Scholar). Mean and standard deviations of at least three independent experiments are shown in the figures. A3.01 T cells were stimulated with 10 ng/ml TPA (Sigma) or 0.5 μm ionomycin (Sigma) for up to 24 h. The MEK-specific inhibitor PD098059 (Calbiochem) was used in a 20 μm concentration of a 20 mm stock solution in DMSO. The p38-specific inhibitor SB203580 (Calbiochem) was used at a concentration of 2–20 μm of a 20 mm stock solution in DMSO. Actinomycin D (Sigma) was used at a concentration of 2 μg/ml of a 0.4 mg/ml stock solution in 10% ethanol, and cyclosporin A (CsA) (Sigma) was used at a concentration of 200 ng/ml of a 10 mg/ml stock solution in DMSO. Cells were preincubated with these inhibitors 30 min before stimulation. To determine the expression of TNF-α, an intracellular immunostaining procedure and subsequent flow cytometry analysis were applied. A3.01 T cells were split 24 h before stimulation. The stimulation was carried out in the presence of 2 mm monensin (Sigma), which prohibits the secretion of proteins, thereby leading to intracellular retention of the produced protein. Treatment of monensin did not affect the basal or induced MAPK activity (data not shown). After a stimulation time of 2 or 10 h, cells were harvested, washed once in phosphate-buffered saline, fixed with 4% (w/v) paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline at 4 °C for 20 min, and subject to the incubation and washing steps described below in permeabilization buffer containing 1% fetal calf serum and 0.1% (w/v) saponin in phosphate-buffered saline. According to the manufacturer's instructions (PharMingen), cells were then incubated with the primary antibody in permeabilization buffer supplemented with 2% goat serum. A mouse IgG1 antiserum (Dako) was used as an isotype-specific control for the monoclonal mouse anti-human TNF-α antibody of isotype IgG1 (PharMingen). After two washing steps, cells were exposed to biotin-SP-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG F(ab′)2 (Dianova), washed again, and stained with streptavidin-Cy-chrome (PharMingen). Fluorescence was measured on 10,000 cells/sample using a FACScan (Beckton Dickinson). Cells were lysed in radioimmunoprecipitation buffer (25 mmTris-HCl, pH 8, 137 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 0.1% SDS, 0.5% deoxycholate, 1% Nonidet P-40, 2 mm EDTA, 1 mm Pefabloc, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 5 mm benzamidine, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, and 5 μg/ml leupeptin), and cell debris was removed by centrifugation. Supernatants were incubated with different antisera for 2 h at 4 °C. The immunocomplexes were precipitated with protein A-agarose (Boehringer) and washed twice with high-salt radioimmunoprecipitation buffer containing 500 mm NaCl. Immunocomplexes were used forin vitro kinase assays as described previously (36Ludwig S. Engel K. Hoffmeyer A. Sithanandam G. Neufeld B. Palm D. Gaestel M. Rapp U.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6687-6697Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar) with myelin basic protein (MBP), 3pK(K-M), and glutathioneS-transferase (GST)-c-Jun(1–135) as substrates for ERK, p38, and JNK, respectively. Proteins were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, blotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, and detected with a BAS 2000 Bio Imaging Analyzer (Fuji) and by autoradiography. The appropriate primary antibodies and peroxidase-coupled protein A were used for detection of the immunoprecipitated proteins in immunoblots, followed by a standard enhanced chemiluminescence reaction (Amersham). To investigate the role of the ERK, JNK, or p38 signaling pathways as mediators of induced TNF-α transcription, we performed transient cotransfection experiments and measured the human TNF-α promoter activity as promoter-dependent luciferase expression in the human T-cell line A3.01. Previously, we have established an approach to selectively activate ERK, JNK, or p38 in A3.01 T cells by expressing constitutively active versions of corresponding upstream kinases (18Hoffmeyer A. Avots A. Flory E. Weber C.K. Serfling E. Rapp U.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10112-10119Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Briefly, a constitutively active kinase mutant of Raf (Raf-BXB-CX) serves as a specific ERK activator. Overexpression of MLK3 results in a strong activation of JNK without affecting ERK and p38 activities. Finally, an active mutant of MKK6 (MKK6(EE)) is a specific activator of p38 (18Hoffmeyer A. Avots A. Flory E. Weber C.K. Serfling E. Rapp U.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10112-10119Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Expression of each of these kinases in A3.01 cells is sufficient to induce strong TNF-α promoter activity in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig.1 A–C, see also Fig. 6), although they exert no effect on a nonspecific thymidine kinase minimal promoter (data not shown). The corresponding catalytically inactive kinase versions showed no significant effect on the TNF-α promoter, even at the highest input (Fig. 1, A–C). Moreover, combining MKK6(EE) with either Raf-BXB-CX or MLK3 synergistically enhanced the promoter activity (Fig. 1 D), suggesting cooperation between these signaling pathways in the regulation of TNF-α-specific transcription. We next investigated the role of MAPK pathways in TNF-α gene expression of T cells activated by TPA/ionomycin in more detail. To characterize the regulation of TNF-α expression, we stimulated A3.01 T cells with TPA, ionomycin, or a combination of both. The inducibility of TNF-α expression was determined at both the translational and transcriptional levels by TNF-α-specific flow cytometry analysis and a TNF-α promoter reporter gene assay, respectively. Reporter gene analysis allows for the assessment of TNF-α promoter activity independent of TNF-α mRNA stability, another control level of expression. Unstimulated A3.01 cells do not produce any detectable amount of TNF-α (Fig. 5 A). Stimulation of these cells with TPA results in a weak induction of TNF-α transcription (Fig.2 B) and synthesis (Fig.2 A). A high induction of both transcription and protein synthesis was observed by cotreatment with TPA and ionomycin (Fig. 2). TPA/ionomycin-induced TNF-α production is sensitive to cyclosporin A, whereas TPA-induced protein synthesis is unaffected (Fig. 2 A). TNF-α protein synthesis was detectable as early as 2 h after TPA/ionomycin stimulation only in the absence of the transcriptional inhibitor actinomycin D (Fig. 2 A), indicating that TPA/ionomycin-induced TNF-α synthesis requiresde novo transcription of the TNF-α gene.Figure 2Expression of TNF-α by A3.01 T cells. A, to measure TNF-α production upon stimulation, A3.01 T cells were stained intracellularly with an anti-TNF-α monoclonal antibody and analyzed by fluorescence-activated cell-sorting analysis (see “Experimental Procedures”). The cells were stimulated with TPA (T) or TPA/ionomycin (T+I) or left untreated (w/o) for the times indicated. Some of the cells were pretreated with CsA or the transcriptional inhibitor actinomycin D. The mean of the TNF-α specific fluorescence intensity of stimulated cells is based on that of unstimulated cells and is given in fold stimulation. The experiment was repeated three times. B, to analyze the induction of TNF-α promoter-dependent transcription, the promoter construct TP(−1057) was cotransfected with a Rous sarcoma virus LTR-driven β-galactosidase expression vector. Cells were stimulated with TPA (T), ionomycin (I), or both (T+I) for 16 h or left untreated (w/o). The relative luciferase activity equalized on β-galactosidase activity is given in fold stimulation based on untreated cells (w/o). The figure shows a mean of three independent transfections and is representative of four independent experiments performed in triplicates.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Therefore, we analyzed the time dependence of TNF-α transcription compared with TNF-α production. TNF-α promoter activity as well as protein synthesis is induced after 2 h of TPA/ionomycin stimulation and reaches maximal induction levels after 6 and 8 h, respectively (Fig. 3, A andB). These results indicate that the regulation of TNF-α expression in A3.01 cells is similar to that"

Here, we have shown that treatment of purified topoisomerase I with caspase-3 resulted in cleavage at DDVD146↓Y and EEED170↓G, whereas treatment with caspase-6 resulted in cleavage at PEDD123↓G and EEED170↓G. After treatment of Jurkat T lymphocytic leukemia cells with anti-Fas antibody or A549 lung cancer cells with topotecan, etoposide, or paclitaxel, the topoisomerase I fragment comigrated with the product that resulted from caspase-3 cleavage at DDVD146↓Y. In contrast, two discrete topoisomerase I fragments that appeared to result from cleavage at DDVD146↓Y and EEED170↓G were observed after treatment of MDA-MB-468 breast cancer cells with paclitaxel. Topoisomerase I cleavage did not occur in apoptotic MCF-7 cells, which lack caspase-3. Cell fractionation and band depletion studies with the topoisomerase I poison topotecan revealed that the topoisomerase I fragment remains in proximity to the chromatin and retains the ability to bind to and cleave DNA. These observations indicate that topoisomerase I is a substrate of caspase-3 and possibly caspase-6, but is cleaved at sequences that differ from those ordinarily preferred by these enzymes, thereby providing a potential explanation why topoisomerase I cleavage lags behind that of classical caspase substrates such as poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase and lamin B1.

These agents slow the resealing steps of the topo I catalytic cycle (6Stewart L. Redinbo M.R. Qiu X. Hol W.G.J. Champoux J.J. Science. 1998; 279: 1534-1541Crossref PubMed Scopus (619) Google Scholar), thereby increasing the number of covalent topo I·DNA complexes within cells (7Hsiang Y.H. Liu L.F.

Muryoi T. Bona C.A. Jimenez S.A. Arthritis Rheum. 1991; 34: 599-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Although the origin and significance of autoantibodies in rheumatic disease remain controversial, it has been proposed that, at least in systemic lupus erythematosus, autoantibodies may arise as a result of abnormalities in the pathway of cell death by apoptosis (15Casciola-Rosen L. Rosen A. Lupus. 1997; 6: 175-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Apoptosis is essential for morphogenesis, tissue homeostasis, and host defense against viruses (16Wyllie A.H. Kerr J.F.R.

Although the precise biochemical pathways involved in mammalian cell death continue to receive intense scrutiny, it is now clear that cysteine-dependent aspartate-directed proteases (caspases (20Alnemri E.S.

Med. 1996; 184: 765-770Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar), topo I is cleaved during apoptosis. However, a contradictory picture has emerged from previous studies of topo I degradation during apoptotic execution. Initial studies indicated that topo I levels markedly diminished during etoposide-induced apoptosis of HL-60 cells without production of a discrete cleavage fragment (8Kaufmann S.H. Cancer Res. 1989; 49: 5870-5878PubMed Google Scholar). Compared with apoptotic cleavage of other caspase targets, e.g. poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (30Lazebnik Y.A. Kaufmann S.H. Desnoyers S. Poirier G.G. Earnshaw W.C. Nature. 1994; 371: 346-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (2347) Google Scholar) or lamin B1 (31Lazebnik Y.A. Takahashi A. Moir R. Goldman R. Poirier G.G. Kaufmann S.H. Earnshaw W.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9042-9046Crossref PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar), topo I cleavage appeared to be a later event and was typically incomplete (8Kaufmann S.H. Cancer Res. 1989; 49: 5870-5878PubMed Google Scholar, 28Casciola-Rosen L.A. Anhalt G.J. Rosen A. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 182: 1625-1634Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar). In contrast to this result, topo I fragments of 70 kDa have been reported in HeLa cells exposed to UV-B irradiation (28Casciola-Rosen L.A. Anhalt G.J. Rosen A. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 182: 1625-1634Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar), HL-60 cells treated with etoposide (32Casiano C.A. Ochs R.L. Tan E.M. Cell Death Differ. 1998; 5: 183-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar), and Jurkat cells exposed to anti-CD95 antibody (29Casiano C.A. Martin S.J. Green D.R. Tan E.M. J. Exp.

In this last model system, topo I proteolysis was inhibited by preincubation of cells with the broad spectrum caspase inhibitor benzyloxycarbonyl-VAD fluoromethyl ketone (10 μm) for 30 min before addition of anti-CD95 antibody. In contrast, during tumor necrosis factor-induced apoptosis in C3HA fibroblasts (33Voelkel-Johnson C. Entingh A.J. Wold W.S.M. Gooding L.R. Laster S.M. J. Immunol. 1995; 154: 1707-1716PubMed Google Scholar) and necrosis of HL-60 or Jurkat cells induced by HgCl2, ethanol, H2O2, or heat (32Casiano C.A. Ochs R.L. Tan E.M. Cell Death Differ. 1998; 5: 183-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar), topo I was degraded into small fragments. Several questions about the apoptotic cleavage of topo I remain unanswered. 1) Which proteases are responsible for topo I cleavage during apoptosis? 2) Where are the cleavage sites located within the topo I molecule? 3) Are the topo I fragments generated during apoptosis enzymatically active? 4) Are the same topo I fragments invariably generated in different cells undergoing apoptosis? In this study, we have mapped the sites at which caspase-3 and caspase-6 cleave topo I, compared the resulting fragments with those generated in situ in several cell types undergoing apoptosis, demonstrated that the major topo I cleavage fragment retains enzymatic activity, and probed the location of the cleaved fragment within apoptotic cells. The results of this study not only identify topo I as a caspase substrate, but also provide an explanation for its slow cleavage relative to other apoptotic events and demonstrate its variable cleavage in different apoptotic cell types. Reagents were obtained from the following suppliers: YVAD-cmk from Bachem (Essex, United Kingdom); Hybond-C membranes, peroxidase-coupled anti-mouse and anti-human secondary antibodies, and ECL enhanced chemiluminescence reagents from Amersham International (Buckinghamshire, UK); agonistic anti-Fas (Fas is the cell-surface death receptor also known as CD95 and Apo-1) antibody CH-11 from Kamiya Biomedical Co. (Seattle, WA); etoposide, paclitaxel (Taxol®), and 5-fluoro-2′-deoxyuridine from Sigma; and polyvinylidene difluoride membrane from Bio-Rad (Hertfordshire, UK). The following antibodies were used to detect topo I by immunoblotting: C-21 murine monoclonal IgM (34Chang J.-Y. Dethlefsen L.A. Barley L.R. Zhou B.S. Cheng Y.-C. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1992; 43: 2443-2452Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) directed against an epitope in the C-terminal 67 kDa of topo I (a kind gift of Y.-C. Cheng, Yale University Medical School, New Haven, CT) and human autoantiserum 3094 specific for topo I (9Shero J.H. Bordwell B. Rothfield N.F. Earnshaw W.C.

Earnshaw W.C. Leibson P.J. Kaufmann S.H. Blood. 1997; 90: 935-943Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recombinant human topo I was expressed in Sf9 cells; purified as described (36Stewart L. Ireton G.C. Parker L.H. Madden K.R. Champoux J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7593-7601Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar); and stored at 5 mg/ml in 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 50% (v/v) glycerol at −20 °C. Recombinant human caspase-3 and caspase-6 were expressed in Sf9 cells as described (37Martins L.M. Kottke T. Mesner P.W. Basi G.S. Sinha S. Frigon Jr., N. Tatar E. Tung J.S. Bryant K. Takahashi A.

Sf9 cell extracts containing recombinant caspases were preincubated at 37 °C for 15 min with 100 μm YVAD-cmk (added from a 10 mm stock in Me2SO) or diluent. Purified topo I was then added. After a 2-h incubation at 37 °C, samples were boiled in SDS sample buffer for 5 min, subjected to SDS-PAGE (38Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207227) Google Scholar) on gels containing 7.5 or 10% acrylamide, and transferred to nitrocellulose for immunoblotting. For some experiments, histidine-tagged caspase-3 (39Srinivasula S.M. Fernandes-Alnemri T. Zangrill J. Robertson N. Armstrong R.C. Wang L. Trapani J.A. Tomaselli K. Litwack G. Alnemri E.S. J. Biol.

Topoisomerase I (5 μg) cleaved as described above was subjected to SDS-PAGE on a gel containing 7.5% acrylamide and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. After staining with Coomassie Blue, putative cleavage products were excised and sequenced by automated Edman degradation using an ABI 476A protein sequencer. Jurkat cells (kindly provided by Drs. C. M. Eischen and P. J. Leibson, Mayo Medical Center) and K562 cells (American Type Culture Collection, Rockville, MD) were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium containing 5% (v/v) heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin G, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 2 mm glutamine (medium A) at concentrations below 1 × 106 cells/ml to ensure logarithmic growth. A549 human lung cancer cells and MCF-7 breast cancer cells (from American Type Culture Collection) were passaged in medium A (A549) or in minimal essential medium containing Earle's salts, 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum, nonessential amino acids, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, and 10 μg/ml insulin (MCF-7). MDA-MB-468 human breast cancer cells (kindly provided by Dr. Nancy Davidson, Johns Hopkins Oncology Center, Baltimore, MD) were cultured in improved minimal essential medium (Biofluids, Inc., Rockville, MD) supplemented with 10% (v/v) heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin G, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 2 mmglutamine. All cell lines were maintained in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% (v/v) CO2 and passaged at least twice weekly. To induce apoptosis, Jurkat cells were treated with 500 ng/ml anti-Fas antibody CH-11 or 68 μm etoposide for 0–4 h as recently described (35Eischen C.M. Kottke T.J. Martins L.M. Basi G.S. Tung J.S. Earnshaw W.C. Leibson P.J. Kaufmann S.H. Blood. 1997; 90: 935-943Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A549 cells treated with 68 μm etoposide or 0.2 μm topotecan for 48 h were separated into adherent (nonapoptotic) and nonadherent (apoptotic) cell populations. Likewise, adherent and nonadherent populations were isolated from MDA-MB-468 cells treated with 100 μm5-fluoro-2′-deoxyuridine (41Kaufmann S.H. Desnoyers S. Ottaviano Y. Davidson N.E. Poirier G.G. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 3976-3985PubMed Google Scholar) or from MDA-MB-468 cells, MCF-7 cells, and A549 cells treated with 100 nm paclitaxel (42McCloskey D.E. Kaufmann S.H. Prestigiacomo L.J. Davidson N.E. Clin. Cancer Res. 1996; 2: 847-854PubMed Google Scholar) for 24 h, followed by a 24-h incubation in drug-free medium. All cells were washed with ice-cold serum-free RPMI 1640 medium containing 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4) and lysed under denaturing conditions in solubilization buffer consisting of 6 m guanidine hydrochloride, 250 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.5 at 21 °C), 10 mm EDTA, 1 mm freshly added α-phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1% (v/v) β-mercaptoethanol as described previously (43Kaufmann S.H. Svingen P.A. Gore S.D. Armstrong D.K. Cheng Y.-C. Rowinsky E.K. Blood. 1997; 89: 2098-2104Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). After sonication, samples were prepared for SDS-PAGE as described (43Kaufmann S.H. Svingen P.A. Gore S.D. Armstrong D.K. Cheng Y.-C. Rowinsky E.K. Blood. 1997; 89: 2098-2104Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Aliquots containing 50 μg of protein were subjected to SDS-PAGE on gels containing 7% acrylamide, transferred to nitrocellulose, and subjected to immunoblotting. Quantitation of polypeptides on the resulting blots was performed by comparison with serial dilutions of untreated cells as described (43Kaufmann S.H. Svingen P.A. Gore S.D. Armstrong D.K. Cheng Y.-C. Rowinsky E.K. Blood. 1997; 89: 2098-2104Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To induce more complete cleavage of topo I, Jurkat cells were treated with 17 μmetoposide or 100 ng/ml CH-11 antibody for 14 h. After the cells were sedimented at 200 × g for 10 min, all further steps were performed at 4 °C. Cells were washed once with RPMI 1640 medium containing 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4) followed by phosphate-buffered saline, incubated for 20 min in nuclear isolation buffer (10 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), and 5 mm MgSO4 containing freshly added 1 mm α-phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and 100 units/ml aprotinin), and homogenized in a tight-fitting Dounce homogenizer. Nuclei and nuclear fragments were sedimented at 15,000 ×g for 15 min and dissolved in solubilization buffer. The post-nuclear supernatant was sedimented at 105,000 × gfor 60 min. Protein in the supernatant from this second centrifugation step (cytosol) was precipitated with 10% trichloroacetic acid, washed once with 10% trichloroacetic acid and three times with −20 °C acetone, and dissolved in solubilization buffer. After treatment with anti-Fas antibody CH-11 or etoposide as described above, Jurkat cells were sedimented onto coverslips, air-dried, fixed in 3.7% (w/v) formaldehyde, and permeabilized with 0.2% (w/v) Nonidet P-40 (44Buckwalter C.A. Lin A.H. Tanizawa A. Pommier Y.G. Cheng Y.-C. Kaufmann S.H. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 1647-1681Google Scholar). Topoisomerase I was visualized by indirect immunofluorescence using anti-topo I antibody C-21 and rhodamine-labeled affinity-purified anti-mouse IgM (Kirkegaard & Perry Laboratories, Gaithersburg, MD) as described previously (44Buckwalter C.A. Lin A.H. Tanizawa A. Pommier Y.G. Cheng Y.-C. Kaufmann S.H. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 1647-1681Google Scholar). After the final series of washes, samples were incubated for 3 min with 1 μg/ml Hoechst 33258 in phosphate-buffered saline prior to mounting in Vectashield (Vector Laboratories, Inc., Burlingame, CA). Samples were visualized using a DeltaVision microscope (Applied Precision, Issaquah, WA). Initial studies were performed to confirm that topo I is cleaved to a detectable fragment during apoptosis and to assess the timing of this cleavage relative to other proteolytic events. After addition of the agonistic anti-Fas antibody CH-11 to Jurkat cells, proteolytic cleavage of procaspase-7 (Fig.1 D) and procaspase-3 (data not shown) was detected within 60 min, the same time frame in which we have previously demonstrated caspase activation using catalytic assays for DEVD-aminotrifluoromethylcoumarin cleavage and affinity labeling (35Eischen C.M. Kottke T.J. Martins L.M. Basi G.S. Tung J.S. Earnshaw W.C. Leibson P.J. Kaufmann S.H. Blood. 1997; 90: 935-943Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cleavage of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase at DEVD↓G (30Lazebnik Y.A. Kaufmann S.H. Desnoyers S. Poirier G.G. Earnshaw W.C. Nature. 1994; 371: 346-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (2347) Google Scholar) to yield a characteristic 89-kDa fragment likewise was detected at 60 min (Fig.1 B). Cleavage of lamin B1 (manifested in Fig.1 C as a decrease in the intensity of the 67-kDa full-length polypeptide) began between 60 and 80 min after addition of CH-11 antibody to the cells. By 180 min, half of the poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase and 75% of the lamin B1 molecules were cleaved in these cells. In contrast, the earliest cleavage of topo I to a detectable fragment was not evident until 140 min after addition of CH-11 antibody to the cells (Fig. 1 A). Moreover, <5% of the topo I was cleaved under these conditions. A similar disparity between cleavage of topo I and the other two caspase substrates was observed after treatment of the Jurkat cells with etoposide (data not shown). These results not only confirmed that topo I was cleaved to a detectable fragment during apoptosis initiated by triggering two discrete pathways in Jurkat cells (35Eischen C.M. Kottke T.J. Martins L.M. Basi G.S. Tung J.S. Earnshaw W.C. Leibson P.J. Kaufmann S.H. Blood. 1997; 90: 935-943Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 45Chinnaiyan A.M. Orth K. O'Rourke K. Duan H. Poirier G.G. Dixit V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4573-4576Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (598) Google Scholar), but also indicated that topo I cleavage was delayed relative to other cleavages. Examination of the topo I sequence (46D'Arpa P. Machlin P.S. Ratrie H. Rothfield N.F. Cleveland D.W. Earnshaw W.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 2543-2547Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar) did not reveal any perfect matches to the preferred cleavage sites of the known caspases (47Talanian R.V. Quinlan C. Trautz S.

Chem. 1997; 272: 17907-17911Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1849) Google Scholar). Accordingly, there were two formal possibilities that could explain the delayed cleavage of topo I. First, topo I might be cleaved by a non-caspase protease that was activated downstream of the caspases. Several groups have presented indirect evidence for such proteases (49Zhivotovsky B. Gahm A. Ankarcrona M. Nicotera P. Orrenius S. Exp. Cell Res. 1995; 221: 404-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 50Shimizu T. Pommier Y. Leukemia (Baltimore). 1997; 11: 1238-1244Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 51Vaux D.L. Wilhelm S. Hacker G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6502-6507Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), two of which have recently been identified (52Wright S.C. Schellenberger U. Wang H. Wang Y. Kinder D.H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 245: 797-803Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar,53Faubion W.A. Bronk S.F. Roberts P.J. Guiciardi M.E. Svingen P.S. Gores G.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; (in press): 103PubMed Google Scholar). Second, it was possible that the delay reflected a slow rate of cleavage by one or more caspases acting at a catalytically less favorable site. This second hypothesis was consistent with the results of the experiments described below. Although 12 human caspases have been identified to date, caspase-3 and caspase-6 are the most widely studied with respect to the cleavage of target proteins during apoptosis. To examine the possibility that caspase-3 and/or caspase-6 can cleave topoisomerase I in vitro, purified recombinant human topo I was incubated with extracts prepared from Sf9 cells infected with baculoviruses expressing either human caspase-3 or caspase-6. Each of these caspases cleaved topoisomerase I at two sites (Fig.2 A). Caspase-3 generated an 80-kDa major fragment and a 76-kDa minor fragment. In contrast, caspase-6 predominantly generated the 76-kDa fragment plus a minor fragment of 82 kDa. Interestingly, neither cleavage reaction was particularly efficient, with ∼30 or 50% of the topoisomerase I remaining intact after the 2-h incubation with caspase-3 or caspase-6, respectively. This is to be contrasted with the quantitative cleavage of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase by caspase-3 within minutes under similar conditions (54Takahashi A. Alnemri E. Lazebnik Y.A. Fernandes-Alnemri T. Litwack G. Moir R.D. Goldman R.D. Poirier G.G. Kaufmann S.H. Earnshaw W.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 8395-8400Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar). Cleavage of topo I by each caspase was completely inhibited by preincubation of extracts with the caspase inhibitor YVAD-cmk at 100 μm (data not shown), consistent with the view that the cleavages were caspase-mediated. To confirm that the slow rate of caspase-mediated topo I cleavage is an intrinsic property of the enzyme-substrate interaction and is not due to other factors present either in vivo or in Sf9 cell extracts, the cleavage reaction was reconstituted from purified components. Purified bovine poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase and human topo I were incubated with purified recombinant human caspase-3 in the same tube for various times at 37 °C, denatured in SDS-PAGE sample buffer, and analyzed by immunoblotting (Fig. 2 B). Under these conditions, caspase-3 cleaved all of the poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase within 15 min. In contrast, topo I cleavage was undetectable at 30 min, but became evident at later time points. Collectively, the observations in Fig. 2 (A andB) establish several points. First, topo I is cleaved by both caspase-3 and caspase-6, making it one of a small number of polypeptides that are reportedly cleaved by both caspases (55Hirata H. Takahashi A. Kobayashi S. Yonehara S. Sawai H. Okazaki T. Yamamoto K. Sasada M. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 187: 587-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar, 56Wen L.P. Fahrni J.A. Troie S. Guan J.L. Orth K. Rosen G.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26056-26061Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). Second, caspase-mediated topo I cleavage is relatively inefficient compared with other substrates. To further explore the caspase-mediated cleavage of topo I, the amino acid sequences of the two cleaved fragments generated by caspase-3 and the two cleaved fragments generated by caspase-6 were determined (Fig.2 C). The analysis was simplified by the fact that, in each case, caspase cleavage liberated a long carboxyl-terminal fragment with a free N terminus. Thus, N-terminal sequencing of each fragment was sufficient to identify the cleavage site. The four cleaved fragments yielded three distinct cleavage sites that were defined in two cases by eight amino acids of peptide sequence and in one case by seven amino acids of sequence (underlined in Fig. 2 C). This analysis revealed sites of cleavage adjacent to Asp123, Asp146, and Asp170. Cleavage occurred in the sequences PEDD123↓G (caspase-6), DDVD146↓Y (caspase-3), and EEED170↓G (caspase-3 and caspase-6). Although this analysis cannot rule out the possibility that additional caspase-mediated cleavages occur in the N-terminal domain, our kinetic analysis revealed no proteolyzed species corresponding to cleavages in this domain. Therefore, if such cleavages do occur, they either must take place after the cleavages described above or must produce species that are further processed rapidly to yield those species. Of the three sequences, only DDVD146↓Y corresponds to a canonical caspase-3 cleavage site. The other two sequences are unusual and would not be predicted based on current understanding of caspase cleavage specificities. A recent comprehensive study employing a positional scanning substrate combinatorial library (48Thornberry N.A. Rano T.A. Peterson E.P. Rasper D.M. Timkey T. Garcia-Calvo M. Houtzager V.M.

Among these, the adjacent UE-A and TSEI elements, located from −113 to −85 relative to the transcription initiation site, function in combination and act as a pancreas-specific mini-enhancer. The TSEI element is recognized by the pancreatic homeodomain factor PDX1. In the present study, we show that the UE-A element binds a heterodimeric complex composed of a Pbx factor and the Prep1 protein, both belonging to the atypical three-amino acid loop extension homeodomain family. Recombinant Pbx1 and Prep1 proteins bind cooperatively to the UE-A site, whereas neither protein can bind this site alone. Transient transfection experiments reveal that both Pbx1 and Prep1 are required to generate a strong transcriptional activation from the UE-A element when this element is inserted close to the TATA box. In contrast, in the context of the intact somatostatin promoter or mini-enhancer, Pbx1 and Prep1 alone have no effect, but they produce a drastic activation when the pancreatic homeodomain factor PDX1 is also coexpressed. Thus, the activity of the somatostatin mini-enhancer is mediated by a cooperative interaction between the Pbx-Prep1 heterodimeric complex and the pancreatic factor PDX1.

Somatostatins are peptides of 14 and 28 amino acid residues that regulate the secretion of various hormones, including growth hormone, thyrotropin, glucagon, and insulin (1Reichlin S. N. Engl. J. Med. 1983; 309: 1495-1501Crossref PubMed Scopus (1218) Google Scholar). The gene encoding the preprosomatostatin is strongly expressed in the δ endocrine cells of the pancreas and in neurons of the hypothalamus, but its expression is also detected in other cell types, such as the D-cells of the digestive tract, the C-cells of the thyroid gland, and sensory neurons (1Reichlin S. N. Engl. J. Med. 1983; 309: 1495-1501Crossref PubMed Scopus (1218) Google Scholar).Previous studies have shown that transcription of the somatostatin gene is controlled by several cis-elements present in its 5′ flanking sequence (see Fig. 1). A crucial activating sequence is the CRE element located between −35 and −55 relative to the transcription start site, which is recognized by the factor CREB and other related nuclear proteins (2Montminy M.R.

In addition, the activity of the somatostatin promoter in pancreatic cell lines is stimulated by two tissue-specific elements, TSEI and TSEII, located respectively at −85/−99 and at −280/−300 (4Vallejo M.

Nature. 1994; 371: 606-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (1552) Google Scholar). Whereas PDX1 binds the TSEIelement as a monomer, it recognizes the TSEII element mainly as a heterodimer with the Pbx factors (6Leonard J. Peers B. Johnson T. Ferreri K. Lee S. Montminy M.R. Mol.

The conserved pentapeptide motif YPWMK present in many metazoan Hox/HOM-C proteins is necessary for the interaction with the Pbx/EXD factors (21Neuteboom S.T. Peltenburg L.T. van Dijk M.A. Murre C.

Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 663-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). The pancreatic factor PDX1, which is very similar to the Antennapedia class of homeodomain proteins, also contains this pentapeptide motif, and this motif is absolutely required for the cooperative binding of PDX1 and Pbx to the somatostatin TSEII element (10Peers B. Sharma S. Johnson T. Kamps M. Montminy M.R Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 7091-7097Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). All of these results show that the function of the Pbx/EXD proteins is to act as co-factors for the Hox/HOM-C proteins but also for orphan homeodomain proteins, such as PDX1.Full expression of the somatostatin gene in pancreatic cells results from the synergistic actions of the different cis-elements present in the promoter. Indeed, previous reports have shown that the activity of the TSEI element is dependent of the immediately adjacent sequence UE-A (located from −100 to −113; see Fig. 1) (4Vallejo M. Miller C.P. Habener J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12868-12875Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The bipartite element UE-A/TSEI acts as a pancreatic δ-cell-specific mini-enhancer. The UE-A site, although devoid of intrinsic activation capacity, is required for optimal mini-enhancer activity (4Vallejo M. Miller C.P. Habener J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12868-12875Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The bipartite UE-A/TSEI element acts also in synergy with the nearby CRE sequence to generate high somatostatin expression levels in pancreatic cells (4Vallejo M. Miller C.P. Habener J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12868-12875Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 5Leonard J. Serup P. Gonzalez G. Edlund T. Montminy M.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 6247-6251Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). The protein binding the TSEI element was identified as a monomer of the pancreatic factor PDX1 (6Leonard J. Peers B. Johnson T. Ferreri K. Lee S. Montminy M.R. Mol. Endocrinol. 1993; 7: 1275-1283Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7Miller C.P. McGehee Jr., R.E. Habener J.F. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1145-1156Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar). However, characterization of the cellular factor(s) recognizing the UE-A element has not been reported to date (25Vallejo M. Penchuk L. Habener J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12876-12884Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).In the present study, we have identified the factors binding the UE-A element. This sequence recognizes a heterodimeric complex containing a Pbx factor and the Prep1/pKnox protein (36Berthelsen J. Zappavigna V. Mavilio F. Blasi F. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1423-1433Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 40Chen H. Rossier C. Nakamura Y. Lynn A. Chakravarti A. Antonarakis S.E. Genomics. 1997; 41: 193-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) (referred to here as Prep1). Although these two factors cannot bind separately the UE-A element, they bind strongly when added together. Furthermore, transfection experiments show that full activation of the intact somatostatin promoter is only obtained when the three transcription factors PDX1, Pbx1, and Prep1 are coexpressed. Thus, we have been able to reconstitute the strong pancreatic-specific enhancer complex of the somatostatin gene by using the two ubiquitous factors Pbx1 and Prep1 and the pancreatic homeodomain factor PDX1.DISCUSSIONThe UE-A element is a well conserved regulatory element of the somatostatin gene and is required for the optimal function of the promoter in pancreatic cells. Whereas the UE-A site is part of a pancreas-specific mini-enhancer, it has no intrinsic transactivating capacity (data not shown and Ref. 4Vallejo M. Miller C.P. Habener J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12868-12875Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This element acts by potentiating the transcriptional activation of the nearby TSEIelement.In the present study, we demonstrated that the UE-A site is recognized by heterodimers composed of a Pbx family member and the Prep1 protein. The two protein-DNA complexes L and S formed on UE-A with the cell extracts correspond to Pbx-Prep1 heterodimers containing, respectively, the long and short isoforms of Pbx proteins. This is demonstrated by the supershift obtained using the specific Pbx and Prep1 antibodies and the comigration of the L complex with the in vitrotranslated Pbx1a and Prep1 proteins. In transient transfection experiments, we observed that the somatostatin enhancer was strongly stimulated by the co-expression of the three factors, PDX1, Prep1, and Pbx1a. Similar stimulations were obtained by replacing the Pbx1a expression vector by a Pbx1b or Pbx2 expression plasmid (data not shown). Taken together, these results indicate that somatostatin gene expression is under the control of Pbx-Prep1 heterodimers.In addition to the somatostatin gene, the only known target of the Prep1 factor is the urokinase plasminogen activator gene (36Berthelsen J. Zappavigna V. Mavilio F. Blasi F. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1423-1433Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Similar to the somatostatin UE-A element, Prep1 binds the COM element of the urokinase plasminogen activator enhancer as a heterodimer with Pbx factors, and the COM element is not able to activate transcription on its own. In fact, COM seems to act by increasing the transcriptional activation produced by the transcription factors bound to neighboring sites (i.e. Jun, ATF, and Ets factors) (38De Cesare D. Palazzolo M. Blasi F. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 2551-2562PubMed Google Scholar). In the present study, we also observed that the Pbx-Prep1 heterodimer, bound on the UE-A element, strongly synergizes with the PDX1 factor bound to the nearby TSEI site, producing a full activation of the somatostatin mini-enhancer. EMSA failed to show that this synergism is due to a cooperative binding of Pbx-Prep1 heterodimer and PDX1 to the bipartite UE-A/TSEI element (data not shown). However, we cannot completely rule out the possibility that DNA binding cooperativity might occur within the cell, perhaps requiring the presence of an unknown cellular factor or eventually requiring the natural context of chromatin.In this study, we show for the first time that the UE-A element can generate a transcriptional activation, but only when Pbx and Prep1 are overexpressed and if the UE-A sequence is inserted immediately upstream the TATA box. Increasing the distance between the UE-A site and the TATA box strongly reduces (see Fig. 9, UE-A/TSEI reporter plasmid) or completely abolishes the activation (see Fig. 9, pSRIF-Luc reporter). These observations suggest that the Pbx-Prep1 heterodimers possesses an activation capacity that is highly dependent on spatial organization. We can also postulate that in the context of the somatostatin promoter, one function of PDX1 is to promote functional interactions between the basal machinery and the Pbx-Prep1 heterodimer. However, further experiments are required to determine the mechanism of the transactivation mediated by the Pbx-Prep1 heterodimers.The protein Prep1 shares sequence similarity with the Meis proteins (Meis1, Meis2, Meis3, mrg1, and mrg2) not only in the homeodomain, but also in the two N-terminal domains involved in dimerization with Pbx factors (36Berthelsen J. Zappavigna V. Mavilio F. Blasi F. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1423-1433Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 39Nakamura T. Jenkins N.A. Copeland N.G. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 2235-2242PubMed Google Scholar, 40Chen H. Rossier C. Nakamura Y. Lynn A. Chakravarti A. Antonarakis S.E.

Genome Res. 1997; 7: 142-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Despite this sequence similarity, the Pbx1-Meis1 heterodimer binds much less efficiently to UE-A than the Pbx1-Prep1 heterodimer. Furthermore, we were unable to detect binding of Pbx-Meis heterodimers on UE-A using cell extracts, and all protein complexes observed were Pbx-Prep1 heterodimers. This indicates that Pbx-Prep1 and Pbx-Meis1 heterodimers could have different DNA binding specificity and could regulate distinct target genes. Actually, it has been shown that the Pbx1-Meis complex preferentially recognizes the TGATTGACAG motif (34Chang C.P. Jacobs Y. Nakamura T. Jenkins N.A. Copeland N.G. Cleary M.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5679-5687Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). We are currently investigating in more detail this DNA binding specificity.The mechanism of action of the Pbx factors has been remarkably maintained through animal evolution. Indeed, both in mammals and inDrosophila, Pbx/EXD factors interact and cooperate with the Hox/HOM-C-like factors (reviewed in Ref. 19Mann R.S. Chan S.K. Trends Genet. 1996; 12: 258-262Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar), and the interaction between mammalian Pbx and the Meis/Prep1 related factors also occurs inDrosophila as EXD interacts with the homothorax protein, which seems to be the ortholog of the murine Meis factors (42Rieckhof G.E. Casares F. Ryoo H.D. Abu-Shaar M. Mann R.S. Cell. 1997; 91: 171-183Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar, 43Casares F. Mann R.S. Nature. 1998; 392: 723-726Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar, 44Kurant E. Pai C.Y. Sharf R. Halachmi N. Sun Y.H. Salzberg A. Development. 1998; 125: 1037-1048Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 45Pai C.Y. Kuo T.S. Jaw T.J. Kurant E. Chen C.T. Bessarab D.A. Salzberg A. Sun Y.H. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 435-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). Homothorax was shown to be necessary for the nuclear localization of EXD and for its function. Remarkably, the murine Meis1 was able to rescue the homothorax mutant phenotype (42Rieckhof G.E. Casares F. Ryoo H.D. Abu-Shaar M. Mann R.S. Cell. 1997; 91: 171-183Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar) and to induce nuclear translocation of EXD. Therefore, it is probable that the nuclear translocation of Pbx factors in mammals is controlled by the Meis factors. Thus, it will be interesting to test whether Prep1 could have such a role. As Rieckhof et al. (42Rieckhof G.E. Casares F. Ryoo H.D. Abu-Shaar M. Mann R.S. Cell. 1997; 91: 171-183Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar) observed nuclear EXD without homothorax expression in some cells of Drosophilaembryo (42Rieckhof G.E. Casares F. Ryoo H.D. Abu-Shaar M. Mann R.S. Cell. 1997; 91: 171-183Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar), it is possible that another factor, similar to homothorax, exists in these cells. This factor could eventually correspond to the ortholog of Prep1. A sequence comparison of homothorax, Meis, and Prep1 reveals that Meis1 is much more related to homothorax than to Prep1, suggesting that before the divergence of vertebrates and invertebrates, an ancestral gene duplicated and generated the Prep1 and the Meis/homothorax genes. Thus, this is consistent with the hypothesis that a Prep1-like gene could exist in Drosophila.The somatostatin promoter is a good model to study the regulation of gene expression by the Pbx factors. This promoter contains two distinct Pbx binding sites, the TSEII and the UE-A element. Pbx binds TSEII cooperatively with the pancreatic factor PDX1, and the formation of this heterodimer requires the FPMWK motif of PDX1 (10Peers B. Sharma S. Johnson T. Kamps M. Montminy M.R Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 7091-7097Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). On the UE-A element, Pbx binds as a heterodimer with the Prep1 factor. This Pbx-Prep1 heterodimer functionally cooperates with the PDX1 factor bound to the adjacent TSEI site. The somatostatin promoter is the only regulatory sequence shown to bind the three factors Pbx, Prep1, and PDX1 (Hox-like) with a high affinity; this gene is thus a good model in order to investigate, at the molecular level, the mechanisms of action of the Pbx/EXD, Meis/Prep/homothorax and Hox-like homeodomain factors. Somatostatins are peptides of 14 and 28 amino acid residues that regulate the secretion of various hormones, including growth hormone, thyrotropin, glucagon, and insulin (1Reichlin S. N. Engl. J. Med. 1983; 309: 1495-1501Crossref PubMed Scopus (1218) Google Scholar). The gene encoding the preprosomatostatin is strongly expressed in the δ endocrine cells of the pancreas and in neurons of the hypothalamus, but its expression is also detected in other cell types, such as the D-cells of the digestive tract, the C-cells of the thyroid gland, and sensory neurons (1Reichlin S. N. Engl. J. Med. 1983; 309: 1495-1501Crossref PubMed Scopus (1218) Google Scholar). Previous studies have shown that transcription of the somatostatin gene is controlled by several cis-elements present in its 5′ flanking sequence (see Fig. 1). A crucial activating sequence is the CRE element located between −35 and −55 relative to the transcription start site, which is recognized by the factor CREB and other related nuclear proteins (2Montminy M.R. Gonzalez G.A. Yamamoto K.K. Recent Prog. Horm. Res. 1990; 46: 219-229PubMed Google Scholar, 3Vallejo M. Ron D. Miller C.P. Habener J.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 4679-4683Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). In addition, the activity of the somatostatin promoter in pancreatic cell lines is stimulated by two tissue-specific elements, TSEI and TSEII, located respectively at −85/−99 and at −280/−300 (4Vallejo M. Miller C.P. Habener J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12868-12875Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 5Leonard J. Serup P. Gonzalez G. Edlund T. Montminy M.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Endocrinol. 1993; 7: 1275-1283Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (see Fig. 1). These TSEs are both recognized by the pancreatic-specific homeodomain factor PDX1 (also named STF1, IDX1, and IPF1) (6Leonard J. Peers B. Johnson T. Ferreri K. Lee S. Montminy M.R. Mol. Endocrinol. 1993; 7: 1275-1283Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7Miller C.P. McGehee Jr., R.E. Habener J.F. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1145-1156Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar, 8Ohlsson H.

Nature. 1994; 371: 606-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (1552) Google Scholar). Whereas PDX1 binds the TSEIelement as a monomer, it recognizes the TSEII element mainly as a heterodimer with the Pbx factors (6Leonard J. Peers B. Johnson T. Ferreri K. Lee S. Montminy M.R. Mol. Endocrinol. 1993; 7: 1275-1283Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10Peers B. Sharma S. Johnson T. Kamps M. Montminy M.R Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 7091-7097Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). The Pbx proteins, including the proto-oncogene Pbx1 and the closely related factors Pbx2 and Pbx3, contain an atypical three-amino acid loop extension-class homeodomain and share extensive sequence homology with the Drosophila protein extradenticle (EXD) 1The abbreviations used are: EXD, extradenticle; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay.1The abbreviations used are: EXD, extradenticle; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay.

Genetic and biochemical studies in Drosophila have shown that EXD acts as a co-factor for the homeotic selector proteins (HOM-C) to regulate their target genes (14Chan S.K. Jaffe L. Capovilla M.

This sequence recognizes a heterodimeric complex containing a Pbx factor and the Prep1/pKnox protein (36Berthelsen J. Zappavigna V. Mavilio F. Blasi F.

Zappavigna V. Mavilio F. Blasi F. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1423-1433Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Similar to the somatostatin UE-A element, Prep1 binds the COM element of the urokinase plasminogen activator enhancer as a heterodimer with Pbx factors, and the COM element is not able to activate transcription on its own. In fact, COM seems to act by increasing the transcriptional activation produced by the transcription factors bound to neighboring sites (i.e. Jun, ATF, and Ets factors) (38De Cesare D. Palazzolo M. Blasi F. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 2551-2562PubMed Google Scholar). In the present study, we also observed that the Pbx-Prep1 heterodimer, bound on the UE-A element, strongly synergizes with the PDX1 factor bound to the nearby TSEI site, producing a full activation of the somatostatin mini-enhancer. EMSA failed to show that this synergism is due to a cooperative binding of Pbx-Prep1 heterodimer and PDX1 to the bipartite UE-A/TSEI element (data not shown). However, we cannot completely rule out the possibility that DNA binding cooperativity might occur within the cell, perhaps requiring the presence of an unknown cellular factor or eventually requiring the natural context of chromatin.In this study, we show for the first time that the UE-A element can generate a transcriptional activation, but only when Pbx and Prep1 are overexpressed and if the UE-A sequence is inserted immediately upstream the TATA box. Increasing the distance between the UE-A site and the TATA box strongly reduces (see Fig. 9, UE-A/TSEI reporter plasmid) or completely abolishes the activation (see Fig. 9, pSRIF-Luc reporter). These observations suggest that the Pbx-Prep1 heterodimers possesses an activation capacity that is highly dependent on spatial organization. We can also postulate that in the context of the somatostatin promoter, one function of PDX1 is to promote functional interactions between the basal machinery and the Pbx-Prep1 heterodimer. However, further experiments are required to determine the mechanism of the transactivation mediated by the Pbx-Prep1 heterodimers.The protein Prep1 shares sequence similarity with the Meis proteins (Meis1, Meis2, Meis3, mrg1, and mrg2) not only in the homeodomain, but also in the two N-terminal domains involved in dimerization with Pbx factors (36Berthelsen J. Zappavigna V. Mavilio F. Blasi F. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1423-1433Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 39Nakamura T. Jenkins N.A. Copeland N.G.

Genome Res. 1997; 7: 142-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Despite this sequence similarity, the Pbx1-Meis1 heterodimer binds much less efficiently to UE-A than the Pbx1-Prep1 heterodimer. Furthermore, we were unable to detect binding of Pbx-Meis heterodimers on UE-A using cell extracts, and all protein complexes observed were Pbx-Prep1 heterodimers. This indicates that Pbx-Prep1 and Pbx-Meis1 heterodimers could have different DNA binding specificity and could regulate distinct target genes. Actually, it has been shown that the Pbx1-Meis complex preferentially recognizes the TGATTGACAG motif (34Chang C.P. Jacobs Y. Nakamura T. Jenkins N.A. Copeland N.G. Cleary M.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5679-5687Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). We are currently investigating in more detail this DNA binding specificity.The mechanism of action of the Pbx factors has been remarkably maintained through animal evolution. Indeed, both in mammals and inDrosophila, Pbx/EXD factors interact and cooperate with the Hox/HOM-C-like factors (reviewed in Ref. 19Mann R.S. Chan S.K. Trends Genet. 1996; 12: 258-262Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar), and the interaction between mammalian Pbx and the Meis/Prep1 related factors also occurs inDrosophila as EXD interacts with the homothorax protein, which seems to be the ortholog of the murine Meis factors (42Rieckhof G.E. Casares F. Ryoo H.D. Abu-Shaar M. Mann R.S. Cell. 1997; 91: 171-183Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar, 43Casares F. Mann R.S.

Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 435-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). Homothorax was shown to be necessary for the nuclear localization of EXD and for its function. Remarkably, the murine Meis1 was able to rescue the homothorax mutant phenotype (42Rieckhof G.E. Casares F. Ryoo H.D. Abu-Shaar M. Mann R.S. Cell. 1997; 91: 171-183Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar) and to induce nuclear translocation of EXD. Therefore, it is probable that the nuclear translocation of Pbx factors in mammals is controlled by the Meis factors. Thus, it will be interesting to test whether Prep1 could have such a role. As Rieckhof et al. (42Rieckhof G.E. Casares F. Ryoo H.D. Abu-Shaar M. Mann R.S. Cell. 1997; 91: 171-183Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar) observed nuclear EXD without homothorax expression in some cells of Drosophilaembryo (42Rieckhof G.E. Casares F. Ryoo H.D. Abu-Shaar M. Mann R.S. Cell. 1997; 91: 171-183Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar), it is possible that another factor, similar to homothorax, exists in these cells. This factor could eventually correspond to the ortholog of Prep1. A sequence comparison of homothorax, Meis, and Prep1 reveals that Meis1 is much more related to homothorax than to Prep1, suggesting that before the divergence of vertebrates and invertebrates, an ancestral gene duplicated and generated the Prep1 and the Meis/homothorax genes. Thus, this is consistent with the hypothesis that a Prep1-like gene could exist in Drosophila.The somatostatin promoter is a good model to study the regulation of gene expression by the Pbx factors. This promoter contains two distinct Pbx binding sites, the TSEII and the UE-A element. Pbx binds TSEII cooperatively with the pancreatic factor PDX1, and the formation of this heterodimer requires the FPMWK motif of PDX1 (10Peers B. Sharma S. Johnson T. Kamps M. Montminy M.R Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 7091-7097Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). On the UE-A element, Pbx binds as a heterodimer with the Prep1 factor. This Pbx-Prep1 heterodimer functionally cooperates with the PDX1 factor bound to the adjacent TSEI site. The somatostatin promoter is the only regulatory sequence shown to bind the three factors Pbx, Prep1, and PDX1 (Hox-like) with a high affinity; this gene is thus a good model in order to investigate, at the molecular level, the mechanisms of action of the Pbx/EXD, Meis/Prep/homothorax and Hox-like homeodomain factors. The UE-A element is a well conserved regulatory element of the somatostatin gene and is required for the optimal function of the promoter in pancreatic cells. Whereas the UE-A site is part of a pancreas-specific mini-enhancer, it has no intrinsic transactivating capacity (data not shown and Ref. 4Vallejo M. Miller C.P. Habener J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12868-12875Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This element acts by potentiating the transcriptional activation of the nearby TSEIelement. In the present study, we demonstrated that the UE-A site is recognized by heterodimers composed of a Pbx family member and the Prep1 protein. The two protein-DNA complexes L and S formed on UE-A with the cell extracts correspond to Pbx-Prep1 heterodimers containing, respectively, the long and short isoforms of Pbx proteins. This is demonstrated by the supershift obtained using the specific Pbx and Prep1 antibodies and the comigration of the L complex with the in vitrotranslated Pbx1a and Prep1 proteins. In transient transfection experiments, we observed that the somatostatin enhancer was strongly stimulated by the co-expression of the three factors, PDX1, Prep1, and Pbx1a. Similar stimulations were obtained by replacing the Pbx1a expression vector by a Pbx1b or Pbx2 expression plasmid (data not shown). Taken together, these results indicate that somatostatin gene expression is under the control of Pbx-Prep1 heterodimers. In addition to the somatostatin gene, the only known target of the Prep1 factor is the urokinase plasminogen activator gene (36Berthelsen J. Zappavigna V. Mavilio F. Blasi F.

https://openalex.org/W2074937939,"Human MxA protein is an interferon-induced member of the dynamin superfamily of large GTPases. MxA inhibits the multiplication of several RNA viruses, including Thogoto virus, an influenza virus-like orthomyxovirus transmitted by ticks. Previous studies have indicated that GTP binding is required for antiviral activity, but the mechanism of action is still unknown. Here, we have used an in vitro cosedimentation assay to demonstrate, for the first time, a GTP-dependent interaction between MxA GTPase and a viral target structure. The assay is based on highly active MxA GTPase as effector molecules, Thogoto virus nucleocapsids as viral targets, and guanosine 5′-O-(3-thiotriphosphate) (GTPγS) as a stabilizing factor. We show that MxA tightly interacts with viral nucleocapsids by binding to the nucleoprotein component. This interaction requires the presence of GTPγS and is mediated by domains in the carboxyl-terminal moiety of MxA. We propose that GTP-bound MxA adopts an antivirally active conformation that allows interaction with viral nucleocapsids, thereby impairing their normal function.

We propose that GTP-bound MxA adopts an antivirally active conformation that allows interaction with viral nucleocapsids, thereby impairing their normal function. Human MxA, a 76-kDa GTPase, belongs to the newly defined dynamin superfamily of high molecular mass GTPases found in yeast, plant, and animal cells (1Staeheli P. Pitossi F. Pavlovic J. Trends Cell Biol. 1993; 3: 268-272Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). These large GTPases play key roles in fundamental cellular processes, such as endocytosis (2Urrutia R. Henley J.R. Cook T. McNiven M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 377-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar); intracellular vesicle transport (3Rothman J.H. Raymond C.K. Gilbert T. O'Hara P.J. Stevens T.H. Cell. 1990; 61: 1063-1074Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar); cell plate formation in plants (4Gu X. Verma D.

Virol. 1991; 65: 968-971Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), accumulates in the cytoplasm of cells (7Staeheli P. Haller O. Mol. Cell.

Virol. 1995; 69: 4506-4510Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) demonstrated that MxA is a powerful antiviral agent. In man, synthesis of MxA is induced during acute viral infections and may thus protect humans from severe disease (12Von Wussow P. Jakschies D. Block B. Tschechne B. Schedel I.

Dis. 1994; 169: 807-813Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). GTP binding seems to be crucial for antiviral activity because mutations within the N-terminal GTP-binding domain destroy the antiviral activity (14Pitossi F. Blank A. Schröder A. Schwarz A. Hüssi P. Schwemmle M. Pavlovic J. Staeheli P. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 6726-6732Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15Ponten A. Sick C. Weeber M. Haller O. Kochs G. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 2591-2599Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, the C-terminal part of MxA seems to play an important role because the coexpression of an antivirally inactive C-terminal fragment of MxA interferes with wild-type MxA activity in a dominant-negative manner (15Ponten A. Sick C. Weeber M. Haller O. Kochs G. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 2591-2599Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, a single amino acid exchange in the C terminus affects the antiviral specificity of wild-type MxA. This substitution results in loss of activity against vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) 1The abbreviations used are: VSV, vesicular stomatitis virus; FLUAV, influenza A virus; THOV, Thogoto virus; DHOV, Dhori virus; GTPγS, guanosine 5′-O-(3-thiotriphosphate); GDPβS, guanosine 5′-O-2-(thiodiphosphate); NP, nucleoprotein; mAb, monoclonal antibody; RNP, ribonucleoprotein complex; vRNP, viral ribonucleoprotein complex; vRNA, viral RNA. while maintaining wild-type activity against influenza A virus (FLUAV) and Thogoto virus (THOV), a tick-borne orthomyxovirus (9Frese M.

EMBO J. 1992; 11: 1657-1661Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). It has been shown that cytoplasmic MxA inhibits primary transcription of VSV and measles virus, an early step in the viral life cycle that occurs in the cytoplasm of infected cells (17Staeheli P. Pavlovic J. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 4498-4501Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Schneider-Schaulies S. Schneider-Schaulies J. Schuster A. Bayer M. Pavlovic J. ter Meulen V. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 6910-6917Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, FLUAV transcribes its genome in the cell nucleus and is blocked by MxA at a later step after primary transcription that is still unknown (8Pavlovic J. Haller O. Staeheli P. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 2564-2569Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, MxA is able to block primary transcription of FLUAV when translocated to the nucleus by a foreign nuclear translocation signal (16Zürcher T. Pavlovic J. Staeheli P. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 1657-1661Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Moreover, recombinant MxA is capable of inhibiting the transcriptional activity of purified viral nucleocapsids in vitro (19Schwemmle M. Weining K.C. Richter M.F. Schumacher B. Staeheli P. Virology. 1995; 206: 545-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Nevertheless and despite much effort, biochemical data demonstrating a physical interaction with viral components are still missing, and viral target structures are presently unknown. Most GTPases act as molecular switches, with the GTP-bound form usually representing the active state (20Bourne H.R. Sanders D.A. McCormick F. Nature. 1990; 348: 125-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (1844) Google Scholar). Members of the dynamin superfamily may be unique among GTPases because they seem to behave as mechanochemical enzymes rather than as molecular switches (21Kelly R.B. Nature. 1995; 374: 116-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 22Sweitzer S.M. Hinshaw J.E. Cell. 1998; 93: 1021-1029Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (551) Google Scholar). It has been shown that the GTP-bound conformation of dynamin self-assembles around tubular membrane invaginations (23Takei K. McPherson P.S. Schmid S.L. De Camilli P. Nature. 1995; 374: 186-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (657) Google Scholar) and that GTP hydrolysis leads to constriction and vesiculation of dynamin-coated tubes (22Sweitzer S.M. Hinshaw J.E. Cell. 1998; 93: 1021-1029Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (551) Google Scholar). Moreover, it has been proposed that the ability to form helical arrays around tubular templates might be a functional link between all dynamin-like GTPases (21Kelly R.B. Nature. 1995; 374: 116-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). In fact, MxA also forms aggregates of ∼30 molecules (24Richter M.F. Schwemmle M. Herrmann C. Wittinghofer A. Staeheli P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13512-13517Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) that adopt a helical structure in solution, 2G. Kochs, U. Aebi, and O. Haller, unpublished results. and C-shaped and ring-like structures have been described for mouse Mx1 protein (25Nakayama M. Yazaki K. Kusano A. Nagata K. Hanai N. Ishihama A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15033-15038Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Biochemical studies revealed that MxA has an intrinsic GTPase activity characteristic of large GTPases and that a high percentage of MxA molecules may be complexed with GTP in vivo (24Richter M.F. Schwemmle M. Herrmann C. Wittinghofer A. Staeheli P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13512-13517Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). We reasoned that it is GTP-bound MxA that represents the antivirally active form and that interacts with viral targets. Therefore, we performed binding studies in the presence of the non-hydrolyzable GTP analogue GTPγS. For this approach, we used THOV because this virus represents the most MxA-sensitive virus known to date. Here, we show for the first time an association of MxA with viral proteins. In its GTP-bound form, MxA associates with the nucleocapsids of THOV by binding to the nucleoprotein (NP) component. We show that this interaction is mediated by domain(s) in the carboxyl-terminal moiety of MxA and can be prevented by a monoclonal antibody directed against this region. These results suggest that the binding of GTP to MxA induces an active conformation of the carboxyl-terminal domain. Furthermore, we suggest that MxA works by recognizing and wrapping around incoming nucleocapsids in the cytoplasm of the infected cell, thereby inactivating their function. Parental Swiss mouse 3T3 cells and cells stably transfected and constitutively expressing wild-type human MxA protein (clone 4.5.15) were the same as described previously (26Pavlovic J. Zürcher T. Haller O. Staeheli P. J. Virol. 1990; 64: 3370-3375Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum with or without 0.5 mg/ml geneticin (G418). 3T3 cells were infected with THOV strain SiAr126 (27Albanese M. Bruno-Smiraglia C. Di Cuonzo G. Lavagnino A. Srihongse S. Acta Virol. (Prague) (Engl. Ed.). 1972; 16: 267PubMed Google Scholar) or Dhori virus (DHOV) strain DHO/India/1313/61 (28Fuller F.J. Freedman-Faulstich E.Z. Barnes J.A. Virology. 1987; 160: 81-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) with an input multiplicity of infection of 10 and incubated for 16 h. For metabolic labeling of viral proteins, cells were incubated for the last 4 h in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium minus methionine and 50 μCi/ml [35S]methionine. The NP of THOV was synthesized in Escherichia coli and purified by means of an N-terminal His tag. Using polymerase chain reaction, aSmaI site was added at positions 14–19 of the NP cDNA insert of the plasmid pBK-L3 (29Weber F. Haller O. Kochs G. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 8361-8367Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This restriction site was used to insert the open reading frame of the NP into the bluntedBamHI site of the procaryotic expression vector pQE9 (QIAGEN, Inc., Hilden, Germany), yielding the plasmid pHisNP. All MxA mutants (see Fig. 1 A) used in coimmunoprecipitation experiments derive from the plasmid pHis-MxA, which contains the His-tagged MxA cDNA (14Pitossi F. Blank A. Schröder A. Schwarz A.

Histidine-tagged proteins were produced in E. coli M15 after induction with isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside and were isolated using Ni2+ chelate agarose chromatography as described (14Pitossi F. Blank A. Schröder A. Schwarz A. Hüssi P. Schwemmle M. Pavlovic J. Staeheli P. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 6726-6732Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). NP was further purified using heparin-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) in 20 mm Tris, pH 8.0. It eluted from the column as a sharp peak at 0.7 m NaCl. Cell extracts were prepared in 50 mm Tris, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 5 mmMgCl2, and 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, pH 7.5. After separation of the cell debris (15 min at 12,000 × g), the supernatants were used for coimmunoprecipitation. First, lysates of MxA-expressing cells or the E. coli-expressed MxA mutants were mixed with a polyclonal rabbit anti-MxA antiserum directed againstE. coli-expressed histidine-tagged MxA protein (15Ponten A. Sick C. Weeber M. Haller O. Kochs G. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 2591-2599Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and with protein A-Sepharose beads (Pharmacia, Freiburg, Germany). After incubation for 1 h, the immunocomplex bound to protein A-Sepharose beads was washed with lysis buffer. The complex was then incubated with35S-labeled lysates of THOV-infected cells for 2 h at 4 °C in the presence of 150 mm NaCl. Following intensive washing with lysis buffer containing 150 mm NaCl, the bound proteins were redissolved in SDS sample buffer, separated on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, and blotted on a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA). Coprecipitated viral proteins labeled with [35S]methionine were detected by autoradiography. The MxA proteins or fragments used for precipitation were detected on the Western blot with a polyclonal mouse anti-MxA antiserum. To confirm the identity of the coprecipitated, 35S-labeled viral protein, the immunocomplex was incubated in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.25 sodium deoxycholate, and 0.1% SDS) for 2 min at 70 °C. The labeled protein was then immunoprecipitated using virus-specific antibodies: polyclonal guinea pig anti-THOV antiserum, monoclonal anti-NP antibody (mAb2), and anti-glycoprotein antibody (mAb10) (all kindly provided by P. A. Nuttall) (31Jones J.D. Nuttall P.A. Virus Res. 1989; 14: 129-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 32Portela A. Jones L.D. Nuttall P. J. Gen.

The immunoprecipitated proteins were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and autoradiography. Viral particles of THOV were isolated from supernatants of THOV-infected BHK-21 cells and purified by sequential centrifugation steps as described (29Weber F. Haller O. Kochs G. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 8361-8367Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Viral genomic RNA was extracted from purified viral particles by the acid phenol method (34Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63232) Google Scholar) and checked for purity by agarose gel electrophoresis (29Weber F. Haller O. Kochs G. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 8361-8367Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). RNA transcripts were synthesizedin vitro from Ksp632I-digested pVN1 (a gift from Florence Baudin and Rob W. H. Ruigrok, EMBL Grenoble Outstation, Grenoble, France) or from BamHI-digested pBSK-MxA using T3 or T7 RNA polymerase, respectively, as described (35Baudin F. Bach C. Cusack S. Ruigrok R.W.H. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3158-3165Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). In vitro transcription from pVN1 yields a short model vRNA of ∼81 nucleotides with the complementary terminal sequences of segment 5 (NP) of FLUAV (strain FPV.GI, H7N1) that forms a panhandle structure.In vitro transcription of pBSK-MxA yields a 2200-nucleotide-long RNA transcript coding for MxA (36Aebi M. Fäh J. Hurt N. Samuel C.E. Thomis D. Bazzigher L. Pavlovic J. Haller O. Staeheli P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 5062-5072Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). After digestion of the DNA template with DNase I, free nucleotides were removed by gel filtration. The RNA was extracted with phenol/chloroform and precipitated with ethanol. To prepare artificial RNPs, viral RNA from THOV virions (600 ng) or synthetic RNA molecules (VN1, 200 ng; and MxA, 560 ng) were mixed with purified recombinant NP (3 μg) for 10 min at 25 °C in 30 μl of 10 mm Tris, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mmMgCl2, and 1 mm dithiothreitol, pH 7.5. These RNP preparations were directly used in the precipitation assays. MxA-expressing cells and cells infected with THOV were lysed in 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, and 0.5 mmdithiothreitol. The lysate of MxA-expressing cells was then centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h. The lysate of the virus-infected cells was cleared by a short centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 10 min. Lysates were mixed and incubated in a volume of 200 μl for 15 min at 37 °C in buffer A (25 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 25 mm KCl, 2.5 mm magnesium acetate, 5 mm EDTA, 150 mm potassium glutamate, 2 mm ATP, 16.7 mm creatine phosphate, 3.5 units of creatine phosphokinase, and 200 μm GTPγS) as described (23Takei K. McPherson P.S. Schmid S.L. De Camilli P. Nature. 1995; 374: 186-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (657) Google Scholar). To analyze the association of MxA with RNPs, the mixture (200 μl) was loaded onto a discontinuous glycerol gradient (200 μl of 70%, 250 μl of 60%, and 50 μl of 50% glycerol in buffer A; total volume of the gradient, 700 μl). The gradient was subjected to centrifugation at 40,000 rpm for 3 h at 12 °C in an SW 50.1 rotor (Beckman Instruments, München, Germany). Eight fractions (80 μl each) were collected from the bottom of the gradient and analyzed by Western blotting using polyclonal rabbit anti-MxA and guinea pig anti-THOV antibodies. The primary antibodies were detected using alkaline phosphatase-conjugated secondary antibodies and 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate/nitro blue tetrazolium as substrate. To inhibit cosedimentation, the lysates were preincubated for 10 min at 25 °C with monoclonal antibodies directed against the THOV nucleoprotein (mAb2) or against the MxA protein (2C12) (37Staeheli P. Dreiding P. Haller O. Lindenmann J. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 1821-1825Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A monoclonal antibody specific for THOV glycoprotein (mAb10) and a polyclonal mouse antibody directed against FLUAV (h38III) were used as controls. To search for viral target proteins of MxA, the following strategy was used. Wild-type and mutant forms of MxA (Fig. 1 A) were immobilized on protein A-Sepharose beads using polyclonal anti-MxA antibodies. These MxA-loaded beads were subsequently used to coprecipitate proteins from lysates of THOV-infected cells. To allow detection of putative interaction partners, newly synthesized proteins were radioactively labeled by incubating the infected cells with [35S]methionine. Fig. 1 B shows that wild-type MxA synthesized in transfected 3T3 cells, but not a control preparation without MxA, was able to precipitate a 35S-labeled viral protein from THOV-infected cells (lanes 1 and 2). The radiolabeled protein had an estimated molecular mass of 52 kDa and was identified as the NP of THOV by immunoprecipitation with monospecific anti-NP antibodies (Fig. 1 D). The same viral protein was precipitated by wild-type MxA produced in E. coli (Fig. 1 B, lane 3). To determine which region of MxA was critical for NP binding, we produced various truncated forms of MxA in E. coli, as schematically depicted in Fig. 1 A. The presence of wild-type (76 kDa) and mutant forms of MxA in the coprecipitation reactions was confirmed by Western blot analysis demonstrating bands of the expected sizes in each reaction sample (Fig. 1 C). A truncated form of MxA lacking the last 90 amino acids (Δ572–662) had lost the capacity to precipitate NP (Fig. 1 B, lane 4). Likewise, a MxA mutant with a central deletion of 275 amino acids (Δ301–576) was unable to precipitate NP (Fig. 1 B,lane 5). Most significantly, however, a truncated form consisting of only the C-terminal half of MxA (Δ1–362) was able to recognize NP, albeit with seemingly lower efficiency as compared with the wild type (Fig. 1 B, lane 6). Taken together, these experiments suggest that NP is the viral target recognized by MxA and that the domains responsible for recognition reside in the C-terminal moiety of MxA. NP is the most abundant component of viral nucleocapsids, also referred to as viral ribonucleoprotein complexes (vRNPs). We therefore investigated whether MxA would recognize NP in these viral structures. Binding was assessed in a cosedimentation assay that enabled us to test the capacity of MxA to cosediment with THOV RNPs during ultracentrifugation in a discontinuous glycerol gradient. A gradient system was established that allowed us to distinguish between free MxA and MxA bound to vRNPs. Lysates were prepared from cells expressing recombinant MxA (26Pavlovic J. Zürcher T. Haller O. Staeheli P. J. Virol. 1990; 64: 3370-3375Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and were then mixed with lysates obtained from either THOV-infected or uninfected control cells. The mixture was separated by glycerol gradient centrifugation, and fractions of the gradient were analyzed by immunoblotting with antibodies to MxA and to the NP of THOV. The NP-specific bands allowed easy identification of fractions containing vRNPs. As shown in Fig. 2 A, MxA alone was not able to penetrate into the gradient beyond fractions 5 and 6. Instead, MxA stayed on top of the glycerol layer. The nucleocapsids present in lysates of THOV-infected cells sedimented as a broad peak into fractions of high density exhibiting a sedimentation behavior that was very distinct from that of free MxA (data not shown). When MxA-containing lysates were mixed with lysates of infected cells, an altered distribution of MxA was observed. MxA now cosedimented with vRNPs to fractions of higher density, suggesting a tight association of MxA with these viral structures. In addition, we were able to demonstrate cosedimentation of MxA with purified vRNPs isolated from THOV particles (data not shown). Next, we wanted to know whether this association was virus-specific. We have previously shown that MxA is an efficient inhibitor of THOV, but is inactive against DHOV, another tick-borne orthomyxovirus (9Frese M. Kochs G. Meier-Dieter U. Siebler J. Haller O. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 3904-3909Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, we tested whether MxA would similarly bind to DHOV nucleocapsids. Fig. 2 A shows that there was no cosedimentation of MxA with vRNPs of DHOV. The nucleocapsids present in lysates of DHOV-infected cells penetrated deeply into the gradient like THOV nucleocapsids. In contrast, MxA remained on top of the gradient as in gradients with uninfected control cell lysates, indicating a failure to interact. These findings suggest that the capacity to interact in our in vitro test system and the ability to block viral multiplication in vivo are most likely two facets of the same phenomenon. The initial experiments were performed in the presence of the non-hydrolyzable GTP analogue GTPγS (Fig. 2 A). Previous studies have shown that GTP binding is critical for the antiviral action of Mx proteins (14Pitossi F. Blank A. Schröder A. Schwarz A. Hüssi P. Schwemmle M. Pavlovic J. Staeheli P. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 6726-6732Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15Ponten A. Sick C. Weeber M. Haller O. Kochs G. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 2591-2599Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19Schwemmle M. Weining K.C. Richter M.F. Schumacher B. Staeheli P. Virology. 1995; 206: 545-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Therefore, it was conceivable that GTP was required for proper interaction of MxA with vRNPs. To address this question, cosedimentation assays of MxA with THOV nucleocapsids were performed in the presence or absence of GTPγS. Clearly, MxA interacted with vRNPs only in the presence of GTPγS (Fig.2 B, panel b). No interaction occurred in the absence of this nucleotide analogue or in the presence of GDPβS (Fig.2 B, panels a and c). In the presence of GTPγS, the RNPs moved deeper into the gradient than in the absence of GTPγS, as indicated by the position of the NP-specific bands. This shift of RNPs to higher density suggests that large and stable complexes between MxA and nucleocapsids were formed. We also tested hydrolyzable GTP and GDP nucleotides. In both cases, MxA did not show an interaction with vRNPs (data not shown), indicating that the non-hydrolyzable GTP analogue most likely stabilized an interactive conformation of MxA. We used monoclonal antibody 2C12 to abrogate cosedimentation of MxA with vRNPs. This antibody is known to recognize a conserved epitope on rodent and human Mx proteins (37Staeheli P. Dreiding P. Haller O. Lindenmann J. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 1821-1825Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 38Johannes L. Kambadur R. Lee-Hellmich H. Hodghinson C.A. Arnheiter H. Meier E. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 9792-9795Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and to neutralize the antiviral effect of murine Mx1 protein (39Arnheiter H. Haller O. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 1315-1320Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). In addition, this antibody is also able to neutralize the antiviral activity of human MxA against THOV when microinjected into the cytoplasm of MxA-expressing cells (data not shown). Therefore, we tested whether this antibody would also prevent the interaction of MxA with vRNPs. Lysates of MxA-expressing cells were preincubated with antibody 2C12 and then mixed with lysates of THOV-infected cells and subsequently subjected to glycerol gradient centrifugation. Under these conditions, MxA did not cosediment with the nucleocapsids, indicating that preincubation with antibody 2C12 prevented the interaction of MxA with the viral target structure (Fig.3 A). In contrast, addition of a non-Mx-specific antibody (h38III) had no effect (Fig. 3 C). Preincubation of THOV lysates with a monoclonal antibody directed against the NP of THOV likewise prevented the MxA-vRNP interaction (Fig. 3 B), whereas addition of a monoclonal antibody directed against the THOV glycoprotein (Fig. 3 D) was without effect. These results support the idea that cosedimentation was mediated by a specific interaction between MxA and the NP component of vRNPs. In addition to NP, vRNPs consist of genomic vRNA and the three viral polymerase subunits. The results of the coprecipitation assay (Fig. 1) and the antibody inhibition experiment (Fig. 3 B) suggested NP as the binding partner of MxA. To futher elucidate the role of NP in the cosedimentation assay, we constructed artificial RNPs consisting only of genomic RNA and recombinant NP of THOV. NP containing six extra histidine residues at the N terminus was produced in E. coli, isolated by Ni2+ affinity chromatography, and further purified by heparin column chromatography (see “Experimental Procedures”). The pure recombinant NP had an estimated molecular mass of 52 kDa and exhibited RNA-binding capacity (29Weber F. Haller O. Kochs G. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 8361-8367Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The genomic vRNA preparation from purified virions consisted of a mixture of all six genomic RNA segments varying in length from 900 to 2200 nucleotides (29Weber F. Haller O. Kochs G. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 8361-8367Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Synthetic RNPs were produced by incubating vRNA with the purified NP in an appropriate binding buffer. Interestingly, these artificial RNPs had a similar sedimentation behavior in the glycerol gradient as authentic RNPs extracted from infected cells (Fig.4B). More important, MxA cosedimented with these structures and reached the bottom of the gradient together with these artificial RNPs (Fig. 4 B). In the absence of artificial RNPs, MxA remained at the top of the gradient, as expected (Fig. 4 A). These positive results encouraged us to use in vitrosynthesized RNA molecules instead of RNA extracted from virions. First, we generated an 81-nucleotide-long model RNA that contained the complementary terminal sequences of segment 5 of influenza A virus. It has been shown that this molecule is able to form a double-stranded panhandle structure similar to the genomic influenza viral RNA segments (35Baudin F. Bach C. Cusack S. Ruigrok R.W.H. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3158-3165Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). Indeed, preincubation of this model RNA with recombinant NP of THOV resulted in the formation of artificial RNPs capable of dragging MxA into the gradient (Fig. 4 C). It was conceivable that this effect was dependent on the panhandle structure of the viral RNA molecules. To further investigate this assumption, we synthesized a linear 2200-nucleotide-long RNA molecule that was predicted not to contain such a secondary structure. This RNA was then used as backbone to build up artificial RNPs. Again, MxA coprecipitated with such RNPs, and GTPγS was necessary for interaction (Fig. 4, D andE). These fin"

One of the most destructive diseases of potato (Solanum tuberosum L.) is late blight caused by infection with the oomycetePhytophthora infestans. After the first appearance in the United States and Europe 150 years ago, late blight of potato, along with that of tomato, re-emerged during the late 1980s and early 1990s as an important disease in the United States and Canada (1Fry E.F. Goodwin S.B. Plant Dis. 1997; 81: 1349-1357Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). Thus, research on the molecular mechanisms of the interaction between potato and P. infestans is of current interest. Plants have evolved various defense mechanisms to cope with pathogen attack. One of these is the pathogen-induced accumulation of compounds with antimicrobial activity (phytoalexins; for review see Ref. 2Dixon R.A. Lamb C.J. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. 1990; 41: 339-367Crossref Scopus (555) Google Scholar). Accordingly, P. infestans infection of potato causes the accumulation of rishitin and several structurally related sesquiterpenoid phytoalexins in tubers (3Kuc J. Bailey J. Mansfield J. Phytoalexins. Blackie Academic & Professional, Glasgow, Scotland1982: 81-105Google Scholar, 4Kuc J. Rush J.S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1985; 236: 455-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). In contrast, P. infestans-infected leaves do not respond with elevated levels of sesquiterpenoid phytoalexins (5Rohwer F. Fritzemeier K.-H. Scheel D. Hahlbrock K. Planta. 1987; 170: 556-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) but show a strong stimulation of enzyme activities of the phenylpropanoid metabolism, such as phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (EC 4.3.1.5) and 4-coumarate:CoA ligase (EC6.2.1.12) (6Fritzemeier K.H. Cretin C. Kombrink E. Rohwer F. Taylor J. Scheel D. Hahlbrock K. Plant Physiol. 1987; 85: 34-41Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7Becker-André M. Schulze-Lefert P. Hahlbrock K. J. Biol.

Among the accumulating phenylpropanoids,N-(hydroxycinnamoyl)-tyramines have been identified both inP. infestans-infected leaves and suspension-cultured potato cells (9Keller H. Hohlfeld H. Wray V. Hahlbrock K. Scheel D. Strack D. Phytochemistry. 1996; 42: 389-396Crossref Scopus (120) Google Scholar). N-(hydroxycinnamoyl)-amines, such asN-feruloyltyramine and 4-N-coumaroyltyramine, are incorporated into cell walls and substantial amounts are also secreted into the cell culture medium (9Keller H. Hohlfeld H. Wray V. Hahlbrock K. Scheel D. Strack D. Phytochemistry. 1996; 42: 389-396Crossref Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 10Schmidt A. Scheel D. Strack D. Planta. 1998; 205: 51-55Crossref Scopus (68) Google Scholar). These compounds appear to be involved in cell wall fortification in response to P. infestans attack. Cell wall incorporation of phenylpropanoids has repeatedly been shown in other systems (9Keller H. Hohlfeld H. Wray V. Hahlbrock K. Scheel D. Strack D. Phytochemistry. 1996; 42: 389-396Crossref Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 11Clarke D.D. Wood R.K.S. Active Defense Mechanisms in Plants. Plenum Press, New York1982: 321-322Google Scholar, 12Beimen A.

Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. 1986; 73: 165-186Crossref Google Scholar, 17Nicholson R.L. Hammerschmidt R. Annu. Rev. Phytopathol. 1992; 30: 369-389Crossref Scopus (1036) Google Scholar, 18Matern U.

On the other hand, the fact that large amounts of tyramine amides are secreted into the culture medium in potato cell cultures may indicate an induced apoplastic accumulation in intact leaves. The P. infestans-induced pathway in potato has also been shown to occur in response to elicitor treatment in cultured cells of Nicotiana glutinosa and Eschscholtzia californica (19Villegas M.

The synthesis of N-(hydroxycinnamoyl)-tyramines is catalyzed by hydroxycinnamoyl-CoA:tyramine hydroxycinnamoyltransferase (THT) 1The abbreviations used are: THT, hydroxycinnamoyl-CoA:tyramineN-(hydroxycinnamoyl)-transferase; HPLC, high-performance liquid chromatography; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; bp, base pair(s); kb, kilobase; ES, electrospray; IPTG, isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside; SSAT, spermidine/spermine N-acetyltransferase.1The abbreviations used are: THT, hydroxycinnamoyl-CoA:tyramineN-(hydroxycinnamoyl)-transferase; HPLC, high-performance liquid chromatography; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; bp, base pair(s); kb, kilobase; ES, electrospray; IPTG, isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside; SSAT, spermidine/spermine N-acetyltransferase. (EC 2.3.1.110). THT was first discovered in tobacco mosaic virus-inoculated tobacco leaves (21Negrel J. Martin C. Phytochemistry. 1984; 23: 2797-2801Crossref Scopus (78) Google Scholar) and has since been studied with regard to biotic and abiotic elicitor- and stress-stimulated activity increases in tobacco and other plants (Ref. 22Negrel J. Javelle F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 247: 1127-1135Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar and literature cited therein). The enzyme catalyzes the transfer of hydroxycinnamic acids from the respective CoA esters to tyramine and other amines leading to the formation of hydroxycinnamic acid amides: S-(hydroxycinnamoyl)-CoA + amine →N-(hydroxycinnamoyl)-amine + HS-CoA. THT activity increases in suspension-cultured potato cells after elicitor treatment (23Hohlfeld H. Schürmann W. Scheel D. Strack D. Plant Physiol. 1995; 107: 545-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), preceded by an increase in the activities of phenylalanine ammonia-lyase and tyrosine decarboxylase (EC 4.1.1.25) (10Schmidt A. Scheel D. Strack D. Planta. 1998; 205: 51-55Crossref Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Purification and characterization of THT was achieved with potato (23Hohlfeld H. Schürmann W. Scheel D. Strack D. Plant Physiol. 1995; 107: 545-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 24Hohlfeld H. Scheel D. Strack D. Planta. 1996; 199: 166-168Crossref Scopus (32) Google Scholar) and tobacco (22Negrel J. Javelle F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 247: 1127-1135Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) suspension-cultured cells. In continuation of our studies on the induction of the phenylpropanoid metabolism in potato by P. infestans, we report here partial amino acid sequencing of THT as well as molecular cloning and prokaryotic expression of a potato cDNA clone encoding this enzyme. We show that the recombinant enzyme possesses similar biochemical properties as the native protein. Expression analyses revealed elicitor-induced accumulation of THT mRNA in cultured potato cells. All chemicals and solvents were of analytical grade and were obtained from Merck (Darmstadt), Serva (Heidelberg), or Sigma (München). In gel digestion of THT, peptide mapping, and peptide sequencing were essentially carried out as described by Eckerskorn and Grimm (25Eckerskorn E. Grimm R. Electrophoresis. 1996; 17: 899-906Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). THT was assayed as described (23Hohlfeld H. Schürmann W. Scheel D. Strack D. Plant Physiol. 1995; 107: 545-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Determination of its activity was done by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) coupled with a photodiode array detection as described previously (10Schmidt A. Scheel D. Strack D. Planta. 1998; 205: 51-55Crossref Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The hydroxycinnamoyl-CoAs were chemically synthesized by the ester exchange reaction via the acylN-hydroxysuccinimide esters (26Stöckigt J. Zenk M.H. Z. Naturforsch. 1975; 30c: 352-358Crossref Scopus (279) Google Scholar) and purified on polyamide columns (27Strack D. Keller H. Weissenböck G. J. Plant Physiol. 1987; 131: 61-73Crossref Scopus (32) Google Scholar) followed by preparative HPLC (system Gold; Beckman Instruments, München, Germany) equipped with a Nucleosil 100–10 C18 column (VarioPrep, 10 μm, 250 × 40 mm inner diameter; Macherey-Nagel, Düren, Germany). The CoA esters were eluted with a flow rate of 10 ml/min with a linear gradient within 50 min from solvent A (1% aqueous formic acid) to solvent B (methanol). The eluates were dried, redissolved into water, and their molarities adjusted by applying known absorbance coefficients (26Stöckigt J. Zenk M.H. Z. Naturforsch. 1975; 30c: 352-358Crossref Scopus (279) Google Scholar, 28Gross G.G. Zenk M.H. Z. Naturforsch. 1966; 21b: 683-690Google Scholar, 29Hrazdina G. Kreuzaler F. Hahlbrock K. Grisebach H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1976; 175: 392-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Based on the partial amino acid sequence, degenerate primers were designed for peptides 7 (5′-CA(C/T)ATITA(C/T)CA(A/G)(C/T)TITT(C/T)TA(C/T)CA(A/G)ATIC-3′) as well as 3 and 4 (5′-C(C/T)TCIAC(C/T)T(G/C)ICC(C/T)TCIACIACIGG-3′). Reverse transcription with total RNA from elicitor-induced potato suspension-cultured cells was carried out using Superscript™ (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Subsequent PCR was performed with 35 cycles of 94 °C for 1 min, annealing temperature for 1 min, 72 °C for 1 min in a thermocycler (Stratagene, Heidelberg). A temperature gradient with 2°-intervals ranging from 42 to 64 °C was chosen to identify the optimal annealing temperature. The 250-bp PCR fragment generated at temperatures of 42 to 48 °C was subcloned into pPCRII (Invitrogen, Leek, The Netherlands) according to the manufacturer's instructions. RNA was isolated from potato (S. tuberosum cv. Desirée) suspension cells that had been treated with P. infestans elicitor for 5 h according to the method used by Dunsmuir et al. (30Dunsmuir P. Bond D. Lee K. Gidoni D. Townsend J. Plant Mol. Biol. Manual C. 1988; 1: 1-17Google Scholar). From total RNA, poly(A)+ RNA was isolated using Dynabeads (Dynal, Hamburg). cDNA was produced using the Time Saver Kit (Pharmacia, Freiburg) and cloned into the EcoRI site of λgt11 (Stratagene). In vitro packaging with Gigapack® III Gold (Stratagene) yielded a library of 7 × 106 plaque-forming units, which was subsequently screened for THT sequences using the radioactively labeled 250-bp PCR fragment as a probe. Thirty positive signals were chosen for the isolation of single plaques. λ DNA was digested withEcoRI, and the resulting inserts were cloned intoEcoRI cut pUC18. Sequence analysis was carried out using the T7-Sequencing Kit (Pharmacia) or with a LICOR automatic sequencer (MWG Biotech, Ebersberg). The coding sequences of the cDNA clone pTHT3 were cloned into the expression vector pQE30 (Qiagen, Hilden). After digestion of plasmid DNA of clone pTHT3 with NcoI and treatment with Klenow enzyme, the DNA was recut with HindIII and cloned into pQE30 that had been cut with BamHI, filled-in, and re-cut withHindIII. Positive clones were transferred into the E. coli strain M15(pREP4). Growth and induction of transformants were performed as described by the manufacturer. Bacterial pellets were resuspended in 1 m imidazole (pH 6.5) and used for determination of enzyme activity as described by Schmidt et al. (10Schmidt A. Scheel D. Strack D. Planta. 1998; 205: 51-55Crossref Scopus (68) Google Scholar). His-tagged protein was purified as described by the manufacturer. DNA was isolated from young leaves of 8-week-old greenhouse-grown potato plants (S. tuberosum L. cv. Desirée) using a plant DNA isolation kit (Boehringer Mannheim) and digested with restriction enzymes. After gel electrophoresis, the DNA was transferred to nylon Hybond N membranes (Amersham Buchler, Braunschweig) and these were hybridized to the radioactively labeled 0.95-kb EcoRI fragment of the cDNA clone pTHT3. Hybridization was performed in 5× saline/sodium phosphate/EDTA, 5× Denhardt's, 0.1% SDS, 50% formamide, 100 μg/ml denatured salmon sperm DNA. Filters were washed three times at 65 °C with 3× SSC, 0.1% SDS. RNA isolation from different tissues of potato plants and Northern analyses were performed according to Geertset al. (31Geerts A. Feltkamp D. Rosahl S. Plant Physiol. 1994; 105: 269-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Determination of substrate specificity, molecular mass, pH optimum, and dependence on cofactors were essentially performed as described (23Hohlfeld H. Schürmann W. Scheel D. Strack D. Plant Physiol. 1995; 107: 545-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar); however, 0.5m potassium-phosphate buffer (pH 6.8) was used instead of 1m imidazole. Hydroxycinnamic acid amides accumulating in potato cell cultures were identified by electrospray (ES) mass spectrometry and were further characterized by HPLC retention times and on-line UV spectroscopy. ES mass spectra were obtained from a Finnigan MAT TSQ 7000 instrument (ES voltage 4.5 kV (positive ions), 3.5 kV (negative ions); heated capillary temperature 220 °C; sheath and auxillary gas: nitrogen) coupled with a Micro-Tech Ultra-Plus MicroLC system equipped with a RP18-column (4 μm, 1 × 100 mm; SEPSERV). HPLC runs were performed using a gradient system from 20 to 90% CH3CN in H2O (containing 0.2% HOAc) within 15 min and held on 90% for 10 min; flow rate 70 μl min−1. Positive ion ES mass spectra were run with a skimmer CID of 20 eV. All spectra were averaged and background subtracted. Analysis of product accumulation in potato cell walls and in the medium was carried out as described previously (10Schmidt A. Scheel D. Strack D. Planta. 1998; 205: 51-55Crossref Scopus (68) Google Scholar). THT was purified (see Ref.24Hohlfeld H. Scheel D. Strack D. Planta. 1996; 199: 166-168Crossref Scopus (32) Google Scholar) from suspension-cultured cells of potato cv. Desirée (10Schmidt A. Scheel D. Strack D. Planta. 1998; 205: 51-55Crossref Scopus (68) Google Scholar). For sequence analysis, the purified protein was subjected to LysC-endopeptidase in gel digestion. THT peptides were separated by reversed-phase HPLC and subjected to peptide sequence analysis (Fig.1). The similarity of the sequences of fragments 3 and 4 as well as that of 6 and 7 suggests the presence of isoenzymes or different subunits of THT, as proposed earlier (24Hohlfeld H. Scheel D. Strack D. Planta. 1996; 199: 166-168Crossref Scopus (32) Google Scholar). A THT-specific cDNA fragment was obtained by reverse transcription-PCR with RNA isolated from elicitor-treated potato cells (see Experimental Procedures). Sequence analysis of the subcloned PCR fragment revealed that apart from the sequences coding for peptides 3 and 7, which were used for primer design, those encoding peptides 2, 5, 8, and 9 were present (Fig. 2). A cDNA library was constructed in λgt11 with RNA from potato cells induced with P. infestans elicitor for 5 h. One of the positive clones was shown to contain an insert of about 1 kb, which was subsequently subcloned as an EcoRI fragment into pUC18 yielding the THT cDNA clone pTHT3. Fig. 2 shows the nucleotide sequence of the THT cDNA as well as the deduced amino acid sequence. The cDNA has a length of 938 bp with an open reading frame ranging from position 53 to 796. There are 52 bp of 5′- and 142 bp of 3′-untranslated sequences; however, the cDNA clone pTHT3 does not contain a poly(A) tail. The encoded protein comprises 248 amino acids and has a calculated molecular mass of 28.4 kDa. Peptide 6 could not be found as a contiguous sequence but is contained in peptides 9 and 7. Expression of THT in E. coli was achieved using the vector pQE30, which adds an affinity tag of six histidine residues to the N terminus. The insert of pTHT3 was cloned into pQE30, and the resulting plasmid pQE-THT3 was transferred to M15(pREP4) cells. Bacterial extracts were prepared and analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis before and after induction with IPTG (Fig. 3 A). A protein band with an apparent molecular mass of about 30 kDa was detectable specifically after induction with IPTG (Fig. 3 A,lane 3). This protein was purified with Ni-NTA-agarose (Fig.3 A, lane 4). Both crude bacterial extracts and the purified protein exhibited THT enzyme activity when measured by incubation with 4-coumaroyl-CoA and tyramine as substrates and analysis of the products by HPLC (Fig. 3 B). Some THT activity was found in extracts containing pQE-THT3 before the addition of IPTG (Fig.3 A, lane 2) indicating incomplete repression by the lac repressor. Bacterial extracts without pQE-THT3 (Fig. 3 A,lane 1) or heat-treated extracts (data not shown) did not show THT enzyme activity. The substrate specificity of the recombinant THT activity tested with various hydroxycinnamoyl-CoAs and amines as possible donors and acceptors, respectively, is summarized in Table I. In general, the data resemble those obtained with the native THT from potato cells (23Hohlfeld H. Schürmann W. Scheel D. Strack D. Plant Physiol. 1995; 107: 545-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) exhibiting a broad donor and acceptor specificity. The enzyme had a high affinity toward cinnamoyl- and feruloyl-CoA with apparent K m values of 0.06 and 0.10 mm, respectively. Cinnamoyl-CoA gave the highest specificity (V max/K m), followed by feruloyl-CoA (47%) and caffeoyl-CoA (20%); the specificities for other CoA esters were in the range of 4–8%. As found with native THT, there was a pronounced specificity for tyramine as acceptor in the presence of cinnamoyl- and feruloyl-CoA as acyl donors. However, using caffeoyl-, 4-coumaroyl-, and sinapoyl-CoAs as donors, the specificity decreased to 2–4% of that measured with the former two. Octopamine showed highest specificity, i.e. 530% compared with tyramine with feruloyl-CoA. These results suggest that the formation of various hydroxycinnamate amides accumulating in the cell wall and secreted into the medium of suspension-cultured potato cells (Fig. 8) is catalyzed by a single enzyme.Table ISubstrate specificity of the recombinant THTSubstrateK mV maxV max/K mmmmillikatal/kgDonoraWith tyramine as acceptor.Cinnamoyl-CoA0.0655.9932Feruloyl-CoA0.1043.5435Caffeoyl-CoA0.1426.31874-Coumaroyl-CoA0.2721.378Sinapoyl-CoA0.3816.142AcceptorbWith feruloyl-CoA as acyl donor, except for tyramine as indicated.Tyramine withcinnamoyl-CoA0.041088cV max from donor kinetics.feruloyl-CoA0.04412cV max from donor kinetics.caffeoyl-CoA0.4844cV max from donor kinetics.4-coumaroyl-CoA0.7734cV max from donor kinetics.sinapoyl-CoA0.9317cV max from donor kinetics.Octopamine0.0365.82193Dopamine0.4372.4168Noradrenaline2.1185.540a With tyramine as acceptor.b With feruloyl-CoA as acyl donor, except for tyramine as indicated.c V max from donor kinetics. Open table in a new tab THT enzyme activity increases in potato cells after elicitation with crude P. infestanselicitor (10Schmidt A. Scheel D. Strack D. Planta. 1998; 205: 51-55Crossref Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Using the cDNA clone pTHT3, steady state levels of THT mRNA after elicitation were determined. Total RNA was isolated at different time points after the onset of elicitation and subjected to Northern analyses. Fig. 4 shows that THT transcripts of about 1-kb size start to accumulate 1 h after elicitation and that maximal transcript levels are detected after 5 h. Background levels are reached after 40–60 h. Nonelicited control cells do not show an increase in THT transcript levels. Determination of THT activity in the same samples reveals that there is a shift in the onset of enzyme activation compared with transcript accumulation. In contrast to transcript levels, enzyme activity remains high up to 30 h after initiation of elicitor treatment. RNA was extracted from different tissues of potato plants grown in the greenhouse and used in Northern analyses with the THT cDNA insert as a probe (Fig. 5). Highest levels of THT mRNA were present in roots, whereas low levels of THT transcripts were detectable in leaves, petioles, stems, and tubers. Flowers did not contain RNA hybridizing to the THT cDNA probe. To analyze the structure of the potato genes encoding THT, DNA was isolated from young leaves of potato plants grown in the greenhouse, digested with restriction enzymes and subjected to Southern analyses. Fig. 6shows the presence of multiple bands hybridizing to the THT cDNA as a probe indicating that THT is encoded by a multigene family in potato. Because the analysis of enzymatic properties of the recombinant THT revealed a high affinity for octopamine as a substrate, we re-examined unidentified compounds, accumulation of which was induced in elicitor-treated potato cells. Using liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (positive and negative ion ES mass spectrometry) and HPLC/diode array detector, the amine conjugates feruloyloctopamine (1Fry E.F. Goodwin S.B. Plant Dis. 1997; 81: 1349-1357Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar), feruloyl-3′-methoxyoctopamine (2Dixon R.A. Lamb C.J. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. 1990; 41: 339-367Crossref Scopus (555) Google Scholar), 4-coumaroyltyramine (3Kuc J. Bailey J. Mansfield J. Phytoalexins. Blackie Academic & Professional, Glasgow, Scotland1982: 81-105Google Scholar), 4-coumaroyloctopamine (4Kuc J. Rush J.S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1985; 236: 455-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), and feruloyltyramine (5Rohwer F. Fritzemeier K.-H. Scheel D. Hahlbrock K. Planta. 1987; 170: 556-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) could be identified. The molecular weights of the feruloyl/4-coumaroyl amines 1–5 (Fig. 7) were indicated in their positive and negative electrospray mass spectra by [M+H]+/[M+2H]+ and [M-H]−ions, respectively. The main mass spectral fragmentation of compounds 1–5 under positive ion electrospray conditions is the formation of an ion of type a indicating the feruloyl (m/z177) and 4-coumaroyl moiety (m/z 147), respectively (Table II). Generally, in the amine conjugates with a hydroxy function at C-7′ (1, 2, and 4) the negative ES mass spectra display a prominent [M−H−H2O]− ion. Additionally, in these cases a weak [M+H]+/[M+2H]+ ion and a stronger [M+H−H2O]+ ion appear in the positive ion ES mass spectra. These ions can be used to differentiate between 7′-hydroxy compounds and those being unsubstituted at the benzylic position of the amine moiety. In the positive ion ES mass spectra of tyramine conjugates, 3 and 5 show the ion atm/z 121 characteristic for ES spectra of tyramine conjugates (32Miersch O. Knöfel H.D. Schmidt J. Kramell R. Parthier B. Phytochemistry. 1998; 47: 327-329Crossref Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Therefore, LC/ES mass spectroscopy represents a very useful tool for the identification of feruloyl/4-coumaroyl amines even in trace amounts.Table IIPositive and negative ion ES mass spectra (m/z, relative intensities), HPLC retention times (RT, min) and UV absorbance maxima (λmax, nm) of compounds 1–5Compound12345Positive Ions[M+2H]+331 (4)301 (5)[M+H]+330 (2)284 (35)300 (2)314 (58)[M+H−H2O]+312 (16)342 (34)282 (12)a177 (100)177 (100)147 (100)147 (100)177 (100)m/z 145(27)(22)(7)m/z 121(38)(10)Negative Ions[M−H]−328 (100)358 (66)282 (100)298 (17)312 (100)[M−H−Me]−297 (8)[M−H−H2O]−310 (54)340 (100)280 (100)RTaFrom HPLC-MS.6.86.49.55.89.6RTbFrom HPLC-photo array detection.23.022.826.221.626.8λmaxbFrom HPLC-photo array detection.221288224222222319319292290319a From HPLC-MS.b From HPLC-photo array detection. Open table in a new tab As shown in Fig. 8, apart from the tyramine amides both the 4-coumaroyl and feruloyloctopamine accumulate as cell wall-bound amides. However, only 4-coumaroyloctopamine, along with the tyramine amides, is being secreted into the medium. Feruloyl-3′-methoxyoctopamine was identified as a compound whose levels were reduced in elicitor-treated potato cells. By isolating a THT cDNA clone from suspension-cultured potato cells we were able to characterize enzymatic properties and expression patterns of THT. The cDNA clone pTHT3 encodes a protein with a calculated molecular mass of 28.4 kDa, which is slightly more than the apparent mass of about 25 kDa that was estimated for THT from SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of proteins purified from elicitor-treated potato cells (23Hohlfeld H. Schürmann W. Scheel D. Strack D. Plant Physiol. 1995; 107: 545-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). A molecular mass of 24 kDa was determined for THT from cultured tobacco cells treated with Pronase as an elicitor (22Negrel J. Javelle F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 247: 1127-1135Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The potato cDNA clone pTHT3 contains the complete protein-encoding region, because the first ATG, at position 53, is preceded by an in-frame stop codon 42-bp upstream. As there are no potential intron acceptor splice sites within this region, it is unlikely that intron sequences are present. It is therefore concluded that the ATG at position 53 represents the start codon for THT. THT belongs to the class of acyltransferases (EC 2.3.1) and indeed, the highest homology of the deduced amino acid sequence is found with other enzymes of this class, namely spermidine/spermineN-acetyltransferases (SSATs) from mice, pigs, and humans. Two conserved domains have been identified inN-acetyltransferases from microbes and animals that are also present in potato THT. Domain I contains a stretch of seven amino acids (RGFGIGS), that was shown to be required for SSAT activity and binding of acetyl-CoA (33Lu L. Berkey K.A. Casero R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18920-18924Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), and that corresponds to RKLGMGS (amino acids 173 to 179) in potato THT. Mutation of the arginine or either of the two C-terminal glycine residues in RGFGIGS resulted in complete loss of SSAT activity (33Lu L. Berkey K.A. Casero R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18920-18924Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Interestingly, all three residues are conserved in the sequence of potato THT. In addition to its homology to domain I, potato THT also exhibits similarity to the conserved domain II ofN-acetyltransferases (33Lu L. Berkey K.A. Casero R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18920-18924Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the spacing between domain I and II as well as the location of both domains in the C-terminal part of the protein are conserved as well. On the other hand, potato THT lacks the C-terminal motif MATEE, which is critical for polyamine binding in SSATs (34Coleman C.S. Huang H. Pegg A.E. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 13423-13430Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) and has a longer N terminus. Some enzymatic properties of the purified potato THT (23Hohlfeld H. Schürmann W. Scheel D. Strack D. Plant Physiol. 1995; 107: 545-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) could not be found with the recombinant THT. For example, we were unable to demonstrate stimulation of THT activity by Ca2+ or Mg2+. It was also impossible to determine a definite pH optimum. Depending on the buffer used, we determined pH optima between 6.5 and 6.8 for the native enzyme with 50% of these activities at pH levels of about 6.0 and 9.1 (23Hohlfeld H. Schürmann W. Scheel D. Strack D. Plant Physiol. 1995; 107: 545-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). In contrast, recombinant THT exhibited highest activities between pH 9.0 and 10.0 with half-maximal activities at pH levels of about 5.3 and 12.4 (data not shown). The broad substrate specificity of the recombinant THT coincides with that obtained with the potato THT (23Hohlfeld H. Schürmann W. Scheel D. Strack D. Plant Physiol. 1995; 107: 545-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Thus, the various amides accumulating in cultured potato cell walls and those secreted into the medium (Fig. 8) could be formed by a single enzyme. This was also found with the purified tobacco THT (22Negrel J. Javelle F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 247: 1127-1135Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Consequently, control of thein vivo formation of the different amides appears to be achieved by supply of the respective hydroxycinnamoyl-CoAs and the amines. For human SSAT, dimerization is necessary to form the active enzyme (35Coleman C.S. Pegg A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12164-12169Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The apparent native molecular mass of potato THT was determined as 49 kDa (23Hohlfeld H. Schürmann W. Scheel D. Strack D. Plant Physiol. 1995; 107: 545-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) with subunits of about 25 kDa (24Hohlfeld H. Scheel D. Strack D. Planta. 1996; 199: 166-168Crossref Scopus (32) Google Scholar) suggesting that THT is also active as a dimer. Expression of THT cDNA sequences inE. coli and subsequent gel filtration analyses on Superdex G-75 showed that the active enzyme had a relative molecular mass of about 63 kDa (data not shown). Because the calculated mass of the recombinant THT expressed in the His-tag vector is 30 kDa, THT appears to be active as a homodimer, as supposed by Negrel and Javelle (22Negrel J. Javelle F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 247: 1127-1135Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) for the tobacco THT. Whether heterodimers are also active, as suggested (24Hohlfeld H. Scheel D. Strack D. Planta. 1996; 199: 166-168Crossref Scopus (32) Google Scholar), remains to be elucidated. A comparison of the properties of the recombinant THT from potato to those of the enzyme purified from suspension-cultured tobacco cells treated with Pronase as an elicitor (22Negrel J. Javelle F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 247: 1127-1135Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) reveals several similarities. For example, the calculated pI for potato THT (5.1) and the one described for tobacco THT (5.2) are nearly identical. Furthermore, the activity of neither enzyme is affected by the addition of CaCl2 or MgCl2. For both enzymes, tyramine and feruloyl-CoA are among the best substrates. As differences we noted that the K m for cinnamoyl-CoA is low for the recombinant potato THT, whereas a relatively low specificity for cinnamoyl-CoA derivatives was described for the tobacco enzyme. Caffeoyl-CoA, which is an efficient substrate for recombinant THT from potato, was used as a competitive inhibitor for tobacco THT (22Negrel J. Javelle F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 247: 1127-1135Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Two of the peptide sequences reported for the tobacco enzyme (ATESVLXDLLFK and LFYQIHEYHNYTHLYK) fit well with the deduced amino acid sequence of the potato cDNA clone. However, the third peptide (FYGPSHEYHN) is not present as a contiguous sequence. THT activity also increases in potato tubers in response to wounding (13Negrel J. Javelle F. Paynot M. J. Plant Physiol. 1993; 142: 518-524Crossref Scopus (77) Google Scholar). This induction and the synthesis of hydroxycinnamoyltyramines are considered to constitute an early response of tuber disks to wounding and might indicate an involvement of THT in wound healing. The low levels of THT transcripts detected in tubers correspond to the observation that untreated tubers contain barely detectable THT activity (13Negrel J. Javelle F. Paynot M. J. Plant Physiol. 1993; 142: 518-524Crossref Scopus (77) Google Scholar). We are presently analyzing whether the increase in THT activity in wounded tubers correlates with an increase in THT mRNA. Analyses of the tissue-specific expression of THT revealed the highest transcript levels in roots. Because products of the THT reaction have been shown to be active against mycorrhizal fungi (36Grandmaison J. Olah G.M. Van Calsteren M.-R. Furlan V. Mycorrhiza. 1993; 3: 155-164Crossref Scopus (69) Google Scholar) it is tempting to speculate on a function of THT in defense against root pathogens. The determination of pathogen-inducibility of THT gene expressionin planta and the functional analysis in transgenic plants will show whether THT plays a role in the plant's response to pathogen attack. We gratefully acknowledge Martina Rauscher and Dr. Claus Wasternack for critical reading of the manuscript. We thank Dagmar Knöfel for preparation of the hydroxycinnamoyl-CoAs and Birgit Kemmerling for providing the potato rRNA probe."
https://openalex.org/W2035375570,"The fibroblast, a cell central to effective wound remodeling, not only contains various growth factor receptors but also high activities of a guanylyl cyclase receptor (GC-B). Here we demonstrate that marked elevations of cyclic GMP induced by C-type natriuretic peptide (CNP), the ligand of GC-B, blocks activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade in fibroblasts. We also show that platelet-derived growth factor, fibroblast growth factor, serum, or Na3VO4 rapidly (within 5 min) and extensively (up to 85% inhibition) disrupt CNP-dependent elevations of cyclic GMP. In addition, the mitogens also lower cyclic GMP concentrations (50% decrease) in cells not treated with CNP. Cytoplasmic forms of guanylyl cyclase, in contrast to the CNP-stimulated pathway, are not antagonized by the various mitogens. The effects of the mitogens on cellular cyclic GMP are fully explained by a direct and stable inactivation of GC-B. Homogenates obtained from fibroblasts treated with or without the various mitogens contain equivalent amounts of GC-B protein, but both ligand-dependent and ligand-independent activity are markedly (up to 90% inhibition of CNP-dependent activity) decreased after mitogen addition. The stable inactivation is correlated with the dephosphorylation of phosphoserine and phosphothreonine residues of the cyclase receptor. These results not only establish a specific and reciprocal antagonistic relationship between mitogen-activated and GC-B-regulated signaling pathways in the fibroblast but also suggest that one of the earliest events following mitogen activation of a fibroblast is an interruption of cyclic GMP production from this receptor.

Wound healing and tissue remodeling require exquisite spatial and temporal coordination of chemotactic, proliferative, and secretory responses in multiple cells (1Clark R.A.F. Clark R.A.F. The Molecular and Cellular Biology of Wound Repair. 2nd Ed. Plenum Publishing Corp., New York1995: 3-50Google Scholar). The fibroblast, a cell central to the above processes, is tightly regulated by a host of growth and chemotactic factors that govern its migration, proliferation, and extracellular matrix remodeling (2Martin P.

Schulz S. Potter L.R. Garbers D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3698-3703Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). CNP, the most highly conserved of the natriuretic peptides (5Tawaragi Y.

Aside from GC-B, some fibroblast cell lines also appear to contain a soluble form of guanylyl cyclase responsive to nitric oxide (7Clementi E. Sciorati C. Riccio M. Miloso M. Meldolesi J. Nistico G.

Whether elevated by stimulation of cell-surface receptor-linked guanylyl cyclases, by stimulation of cytosolic guanylyl cyclases, or by direct addition of cell-permeant analogs, cyclic GMP slows the onset of DNA synthesis, decreases cell proliferation, and inhibits chemotaxis (8Calderone A.

Thus, significant antagonistic interplay may occur between growth factor-regulated pathways and guanylyl cyclase-regulated pathways in the fibroblast. Here, we demonstrate for the first time that elevations of cyclic GMP block mitogen-induced activation of the MAP kinase pathway in immortalized fibroblasts. We then demonstrate that platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), fetal bovine serum (FBS), or fibroblast growth factor (FGF) markedly blunt CNP-induced elevations of cyclic GMP in either immortalized fibroblast cell lines or primary fibroblast cultures. The inhibitory effects of the growth factors or of serum on cyclic GMP concentrations are rapid (within 5 min) and extensive and are mediated by a direct and stable inhibition of GC-B. Intriguingly, an inhibition of both ligand-independent and CNP-dependent GC-B activity is evident. The opposing effect of the mitogens is also highly specific, since NO-stimulated elevations of cyclic GMP are not altered by growth factors or serum. The results strongly suggest that a temporal, antagonistic relationship exists between a specific guanylyl cyclase receptor (GC-B) and various mitogens during fibroblast activation and that this occurs in the presence or absence of the ligand, CNP. Since cyclic GMP inhibits the MAP kinase pathway independent of its source of synthesis, the results also suggest that growth factor-induced inhibition of the NO-regulated pathway is not required for mitogen action. C-type natriuretic peptide and des-[Cys105,Cys121]atrial natriuretic peptide-(104–126) were from Peninsula Labs; BALB/3T3 (clone A31) and A-10 cell lines were from ATCC; NIH/3T3 cells overexpressing rat guanylyl cyclase-B (GC-B/3T3) were as recently described (14Hutchinson H.G. Trindale P.T. Cunanan D.B. Wu C.-F. Pratt R.E. Cardiovasc. Res. 1997; 5: 158-167Crossref Scopus (70) Google Scholar). A BALB/3T3 fibroblast cell line overexpressing the NO-stimulated, rat heterodimeric (α1/β1) cytosolic guanylyl cyclase was from Dr. Peter Yuen (University of Tennessee, Memphis) and early passage human dermal fibroblasts were from G. Skuta and F. Grinnell (University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, TX). Nucleotides were from Boehringer Mannheim and Sigma. Cell culture materials were from Life Technologies, Inc. PDGFbb and basic FGF were from R & D Systems. Antibodies to the phosphorylated forms of ERK1/2 and MEK1/2 were from Promega and anti-ERK1 antibodies were from PharMingen. All other reagents were obtained from Sigma unless noted otherwise. Cells were grown and maintained using standard techniques. BALB/3T3 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) containing antibiotic/antimycotics and 10% calf serum or 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) as indicated. NIH/3T3 cells overexpressing rat GC-B (GCB/3T3) and BALB/3T3 cells overexpressing the rat soluble guanylyl cyclase (sgc/3T3) cell lines were maintained in DMEM/antibiotic/antimycotic, 10% FBS, and 0.1 mg/ml G418. Confluent cells were considered quiescent after maintenance in 0.5% FBS for 36–48 h or after 24 h in 0.5% FBS followed by 18–24 h in the absence of FBS. Quiescent cells were treated with serum (standard heat-inactivated for tissue culture) and growth factors for varying times 2 to 4 h after adding fresh medium containing the appropriate amount of serum. Vehicle alone or growth factors were added and the cells treated as described in the figure legends. With the exception of FBS, volume additions did not exceed 1% of cell media volume. The cyclic GMP content of intact cells plus medium was determined as follows: IBMX (0.25 mm final) was added and, where indicated, followed 10 min later by CNP (20 nm final) and the cells incubated an additional 10 min. HClO4 (0.5n final) was added, and the acidified extracts were analyzed for cyclic GMP. Cyclic GMP was estimated by radioimmunoassay following purification of the perchloric acid extracts (16Domino S.E. Tubb D.L. Garbers D.L. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 201: 345-355Crossref Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Quiescent GCB/3T3 fibroblasts (24-well plates) in serum-deprived media were incubated for 1 h with 20 nm CNP followed with 0–1% FBS for 14 h, and then 2 μCi/ml [3H]thymidine (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was added for an additional 2 h. The cells were washed with cold phosphate-buffered saline, incubated with 10% trichloroacetic acid for 30 min at 4 °C, washed with 10% trichloroacetic acid, and insoluble material dissolved in 1n NaOH. Radioactivity in a 50-μl aliquot was determined in a scintillation counter. Quiescent cells in 60- or 100-mm dishes were treated with specific growth factors, serum, or Na3VO4 as indicated in the figure legends. The cells were washed twice with cold phosphate-buffered saline, and the dish was immersed in liquid N2 and stored at −80 °C. The frozen cells were thawed at 0–2 °C in 0.3 (60-mm dish) or 0.5 ml (100 mm dish) of ice-cold homogenization buffer (50 mmHepes, pH 7.5, 10% glycerol, 100 mm NaCl, 10 μg/ml each of leupeptin, pepstatin, and aprotinin, 50 mm NaF, 1 mm EDTA, and 1 mmNa3VO4), scraped from the dish, and sonicated 3 times for 3 s. Protein concentration (bicinchoninic acid, Pierce) was determined, and the homogenates were aliquoted, frozen in liquid N2, and stored at −80 °C. Guanylyl cyclase activity was estimated at 37 °C in a final volume of 100 μl. The standard reaction mixture contained, in final concentrations, 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 7 mmMgCl2, 1 mm GTP, 1 mm ATP, 120 mm NaCl, 2% glycerol, 0.2 mm EDTA, 10 mm NaF,1 mm NaN3, and 1 mm Na3VO4. CNP, when present, was 20 nm. Maximal guanylyl cyclase activity in homogenates was estimated under the above conditions with the exceptions that ATP was omitted, MgCl2 was replaced with 5 mmMnCl2, and 1% Triton X-100 was added. The guanylyl cyclase reaction was initiated by the addition of homogenate (5–10 μg of protein) to the prewarmed (37 °C) reaction mixture and terminated by adding 0.5 ml of ice-cold 110 mmZn(C2H3O2)2 followed by addition of 0.5 ml of 110 mmNa2CO3. The samples were frozen, thawed, and the supernatant fluid (3,000 × g, 15 min) fractionated by alumina chromatography. Cyclic GMP in the eluant was estimated by radioimmunoassay as above. In all cases cyclic GMP formation was linear with time and protein concentration. Following incubations in 6- or 12-well plates, the cells were frozen and thawed in 150 or 300 μl of homogenization medium containing 1% Triton X-100. Detergent-soluble protein was extracted for 1 h on ice, the extracts sonicated, and insoluble material removed by centrifugation for 30 min at 16,000 × g. Proteins were electrophoretically resolved on 8% acrylamide, 0.1% SDS gels and transferred to polyvinylidene fluoride membranes (Immobilon-P, Millipore Corp.) The membranes were probed overnight with antibodies to phosphorylated ERK1/2 (Promega), MEK1/2 (New England Biolabs) or ERK1 (PharMingen) according to the supplier's instructions. Bound antibodies were detected by chemiluminescence (ECL, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Confluent, quiescent GCB/3T3 cells in 100-mm dishes were incubated 15 h in 5 ml of phosphate-free DMEM containing 1 mCi of [32P]orthophosphate and 0.5% FBS followed by a 1-h incubation in the absence or presence of 10% FBS or 0.1 mmNa3VO4. The cells were washed twice with 5 ml of ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and frozen on liquid N2. The frozen cells were thawed at 0–2 °C in 0.8 ml of cold homogenization buffer containing 1% Triton X-100, passed through a 25-gauge needle 10–15 times, and rocked at 4 °C for 2 h. The mixture was centrifuged at 170,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C and the pelleted material discarded. Fifteen μl of normal rabbit serum and 50 μl of a 50% protein A-agarose (Pierce) slurry were added, and the samples were incubated for 60 min at 4 °C. Protein A-agarose was removed (14,000 × g, 5 min), and 20 μl of a rabbit polyclonal antibody to the C-terminal 14 amino acids of rat guanylyl cyclase-B was added, and the samples were incubated overnight at 4 °C. The protein A-agarose antibody complex was pelleted as above and thoroughly washed in cold homogenization buffer containing 1% Triton X-100. Thirty five μl of Laemmli sample buffer and 3.5 μl of β-mercaptoethanol were added, and the samples boiled and immunoprecipitated GC-B was isolated by SDS-PAGE (0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate, 8% polyacrylamide). The resolved proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes and the membrane probed overnight with the same polyclonal antibody as above. Goat anti-rabbit IgG coupled to horseradish peroxidase was visualized by chemiluminescence (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Following autoradiography, the bands corresponding to GC-B were excised and phosphoamino acid analyses performed on the acid hydrolysates (17Boyle W.J. van der Geer P. Hunter T. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 201: 110-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (1275) Google Scholar). Treatment of quiescent GC-B/3T3 fibroblasts with 20 nmCNP 220 nm CNP stimulation of GC-B results in high levels of cyclic GMP in these cells (Fig. 5). prior to addition of serum sharply decreased the phosphorylation of ERK1/2 without decreasing the amount of ERK protein (Fig.1). This is the first observation that activation of a cyclic GMP signaling pathway leads to inhibition of the MAP kinase cascade in fibroblasts. The marked decline in phosphorylated ERK1/2 was accompanied by a decreased phosphorylation of MEK (not shown), the upstream activator of ERK1/2, suggesting that CNP interferes with an early step in activation of the MAP kinase cascade. 3Under these conditions, we were unable to detect the presence of mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphatase-1, the MAP kinase phosphatase reportedly induced by ANP in mesangial cells (18Sugimoto T. Kikkawa R. Haneda M. Shigeta Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 195: 72-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). It is evident from Fig. 1 that CNP was most effective at low serum concentrations (0–0.3%), less so at intermediate serum concentrations (0.5–1%), and at higher serum concentrations (3–5%) only somewhat effective in blocking ERK phosphorylation. In the absence of serum, treatment of cells with 20 nm CNP for 14 h decreased [3H]thymidine incorporation by an average of 18% and consistent with serum antagonism of the CNP effects on ERK1/2 phosphorylation, 20 nm CNP decreased thymidine incorporation 10% (0.1% serum), about 7% (0.5% serum), and ineffectively at higher amounts of serum (not shown). 4Others (19Appel R.G. Am. J. Physiol. 1990; 259: E312-E318PubMed Google Scholar) also have noted that NIH/3T3 cell lines are relatively resistant to antimitogenic effects of natriuretic peptides, possibly explained by rapid homologous desensitization of GC-A or GC-B (15Potter L.R. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 2422-2429Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The natriuretic peptide clearance receptor (which binds natriuretic peptides but does not possess guanylyl cyclase activity (20Fethiere J. Meloche S. Nguyen T.T. Ong H. de Lean A. Mol. Pharmacol. 1989; 35: 584-592PubMed Google Scholar)) has been reported to mediate ANP inhibition of mitogen activation of the MAP kinase cascade in some (21Prins B.A. Weber M.J. Hu R.-M. Pdram A. Daniels M. Levin E.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14156-14162Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) but not all (22Hutchinson H.G. Trindale P.T. Cunanan D.B. Wu C.-F. Pratt R.E. Cardiovasc. Res. 1997; 35: 158-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) cell lines. To determine if the above effects of CNP were mediated by the clearance receptor in the GC-B/3T3 cell line, des-[Cys105,Cys121]ANP, a ligand selective for the clearance receptor (23Cahill P.A. Hassid A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 179: 1606-1613Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), was tested on these cells at concentrations of 20–1000 nm and did not inhibit basal or serum-stimulated ERK1/2 phosphorylation or DNA synthesis. These observations and the ability of low CNP concentrations to inhibit ERK1/2 phosphorylation (Fig. 1) in cells overexpressing GC-B (conditions which would favor CNP acting through GC-B rather than the clearance receptor) are clear evidence that the effects of CNP are mediated by GC-B. The diminished effectiveness of CNP at the higher serum concentrations could be explained by serum antagonism of CNP signaling. If so, then net signaling by CNP- and serum- stimulated pathways may reflect a balance between these two opposing signaling systems. Experiments on intact and broken cells were thus designed to determine if serum and defined mitogens interfere with CNP signaling (as measured by cyclic GMP elevation in intact cells). The addition of serum (10%) to quiescent BALB/3T3 fibroblasts (0.5% serum) for 1 h decreased CNP-stimulated elevations of cyclic GMP by nearly 70% (Fig. 2, 0.5+10), whereas the CNP response was unaffected in normally cycling cells (10% serum) (Fig. 2, 10+10). The 25% decline in CNP-elevated cyclic GMP levels in serum-starved cells compared with control cells (Fig. 2,0.5+0.5 versus 10+10) is not due to a decreased sensitivity to CNP (data not shown) but reflects partial cell loss during serum starvation and possibly decreased expression of GC-B and/or other proteins necessary for signaling. PDGF, at concentrations of 300–500 pm, is the primary fibroblast mitogen in serum, accounting for at least 50% of the mitogenic activity (24Grainger D.J. Mosedale D.E. Metcalf J.C. Weissberg P.L. Kemp P.R. Clin. Chim. Acta. 1995; 235: 11-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 25Kohler N. Lipton A. Exp. Cell Res. 1974; 87: 297-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar, 26Meyer-Ingold W. Eichner W. Cell Biol. Int. 1995; 19: 389-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). PDGF binding to specific heterodimeric or homodimeric cell-surface receptor tyrosine kinases results in activation of the MAP kinase cascade, protein kinase C, and several other distinct signaling pathways (27Claesson-Welsh L. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1996; 28: 373-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 28Vignais M.-L. Sadowski H.B. Watling D. Rogers N.C. Gilman M. Mol. Cell.

Low concentrations of PDGF (in the presence of 0.5% serum) rapidly and effectively interfered with CNP signaling (as monitored by elevation of cyclic GMP) in quiescent BALB/3T3 fibroblasts (Fig. 3). PDGF inhibition was concentration-dependent (Fig.3 A) and, in sub-nanomolar amounts, was as effective as serum in inhibiting CNP signaling. These concentrations of PDGF are well within the range that is mitogenic for this and other cells of mesenchymal origin (30Pledger W.J. Stiles C.D. Antoniades H.N. Scher C.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 4481-4485Crossref PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar, 31Lau L.F. Nathans D. EMBO J. 1985; 4: 3145-3151Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar, 32Graf K. Xi X.-P. Yang D. Fleck E. Hsueh W.A. Law R.E. Hypertension. 1997; 29: 334-339Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The inset of Fig. 3 Ashows, by Western blot analysis of phosphorylated ERKs 1 and 2, that concentrations of PDGF that decrease CNP signaling also cause near-maximal activation of the MAP kinase pathway. The inhibitory effect of PDGF developed rapidly (short lag-time) (Fig. 3 B) as is the case with PDGF activation of the MAP kinase cascade (33Dudley D.T. Pang L. Decker S.J. Bridges A.J. Saltiel A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7686-7689Crossref PubMed Scopus (2589) Google Scholar). Treatment of the quiescent cells with 0.3 nm PDGF (in the presence of 0.5% serum) resulted in a rapid (evident within 5 min) and sharp decline in CNP-stimulated elevation of cyclic GMP levels reaching near-maximal inhibition within 60 min. The rapidity of PDGF inhibition is clear from the inset where PDGF was added shortlyafter CNP. The similar time courses and concentration dependence of PDGF inhibition of the CNP signaling pathway and stimulation of the MAP kinase cascade suggest that suppression of CNP signaling through cyclic GMP is an early downstream consequence of PDGF receptor activation. That this inhibition of CNP by serum and defined mitogens is not confined to immortalized cell lines was confirmed in rat aortic smooth muscle cells (A-10) and early passage human dermal fibroblasts (not shown). Such results suggest that inactivation of GC-B by mitogens represents a general consequence of growth factor signaling serving to limit cyclic GMP antagonism of growth factor-regulated cell function. The above experiments established that serum and PDGF decrease the cyclic GMP signal generated in response to CNP stimulation of the cell-surface receptor guanylyl cyclase, GC-B. NO and NO-sensitive cytosolic guanylyl cyclase, a key signaling pathway in many cell types (34Drewett J.G. Garbers D.L. Endocr. Rev. 1994; 15: 135-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar), have been reported as antimitogenic under some conditions (8Calderone A. Thaik C.M. Takahashi N. Chang D.L.F. Colucci W.S. J. Clin.

Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 1647-1658Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar), and all decreased CNP elevations of cyclic GMP without diminishing NO stimulation of cyclic GMP (Fig. 4). Thus, the CNP-stimulated cell-surface cyclase, GC-B, is a specific target of the mitogens, and increased degradation of cyclic GMP is not a mechanism of serum or PDGF inhibition of CNP elevations of cyclic GMP. Reversible protein-tyrosine phosphorylation is a common mechanism of mitogen signaling (38Hunter T. Cell. 1995; 80: 225-236Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2591) Google Scholar). Na3VO4, a cell permeant, non-selective protein-tyrosine-phosphatase inhibitor mimics the effects of many ligands that activate protein-tyrosine-kinases and the MAP kinase pathway (39Gordon J.A. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 201: 477-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar, 40Posner B.I. Faure R. Burgess J.W. Bevan A.P. Lachance D. Zhang-Sun G. Fantus I.G. Ng J.B. Hall D.A. Lum B.S. J. Biol.

This phosphatase inhibitor also mimics the effects of serum and PDGF on CNP signaling in fibroblasts (Fig. 5). Treatment of quiescent GC-B/3T3 fibroblasts with 5–50 μmNa3VO4 for 50 min reduced CNP elevations of cyclic GMP 50–80%, 5Basal and CNP-stimulated activities of GC-B in cell homogenates are not inhibited by 1 mmNa3VO4 or by 10% FBS suggesting that their effects in intact cells are not due to direct inhibition of the cyclase. respectively, while activating the MAP kinase cascade (inset). Serum, PDGF, and FGF also decrease CNP signaling in these cells (not shown), the effects being qualitatively and quantitatively similar to those found with the endogenously expressed GC-B of the BALB/3T3 fibroblasts. A simple and plausible explanation of these results and those of Figs. 2 and 3 is that tyrosine phosphorylation of GC-B inhibits guanylyl cyclase activity. Alternatively, regulatory proteins “activated” directly or indirectly by tyrosine phosphorylation could inhibit the cyclase by stable association or by phosphorylation or dephosphorylation. Quiescent cells were incubated with 10% serum or 100 μm Na3VO4for various times, and guanylyl cyclase activity was estimated in the subsequent homogenate 6The same results were seen with washed 100,000 × g pellets. in the absence or presence of 20 nm CNP (Fig.6). Serum treatment of intact cells decreased CNP-stimulated guanylyl cyclase activity within 5 min, and by 15 min this activity was depressed to that seen in the absence of CNP (Fig. 6 A). Reduction of activity in the absence of CNP was not as rapid but declined to 50% of control values by 15 min. These results are consistent with a stable inactivation of guanylyl cyclase and provide a mechanism for the effects of serum on cyclic GMP levels in intact cells. Na3VO4 produced essentially the same effects on basal and CNP-stimulated activities as serum (Fig.6 B) implying that both serum and Na3VO4 employ identical or similar mechanisms to disrupt CNP signaling in intact cells. Phosphorylation/dephosphorylation could explain the apparent stable inactivation of GC-B (15Potter L.R. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 2422-2429Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Quiescent cells in 0.5% serum were metabolically labeled with 32P and then treated with 10% serum or 100 μmNa3VO4 for 1 h. Autoradiography, immunoquantitation by Western blot analysis, and phosphoamino acid analyses of immunoprecipitated GC-B (Fig.7) showed large decreases in32P content of GC-B (autoradiograph, upper panel), with no loss of GC-B protein (Western blot (WB), middle panel). Significantly, GC-B contained no detectable phosphotyrosine 7Phosphotyrosine immunoblots did not detect phosphotyrosine associated with immunoprecipitated GC-B under these conditions. prior to or after mitogen treatment (phosphoamino acid analysis,lower panel), and thus the loss of 32P was attributable to decreases in phosphoserine and phosphothreonine. Decreased phosphoserine and phosphothreonine correlate with decreased CNP stimulation in intact cells following serum or Na3VO4 treatment yielding end points similar to those seen for ligand-induced dephosphorylation and desensitization to ligand of both GC-A and GC-B (15Potter L.R. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 2422-2429Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 42Potter L.R. Garbers D.L J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 14531-14534Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Specific phosphoamino acids in GC-B have been identified as necessary for ligand-induced signaling and undergo ligand-stimulated dephosphorylation, and thus dephosphorylation of one or more of these residues may account for mitogen-induced inactivation of GC-B (43Potter L.R. Hunter T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15533-15539Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). The results of the preceding studies show that CNP markedly elevates cyclic GMP in both quiescent (serum-limited) and normal cycling (serum-replete) cells (Fig. 2). However, relatively high serum or defined growth factors added to quiescent cells rapidly and sharply decreases CNP stimulation of GC-B in intact cells (Figs. 2 and 3) by directly lowering cyclase activity (Fig. 6) in the absence of changes in GC-B expression (Fig. 7). It is clear then that mitogens substantially disrupt signaling through inactivation of GC-B, consequently suppressing CNP elevation of cyclic GMP in whole cells or in broken cells. Conversely, CNP antagonism of serum activation of the MAP kinase cascade (Fig. 1) demonstrates that CNP and mitogens are antagonists at least in the “resting” or G0/early G1 phase of the cell cycle. 8Similar effects were seen with BALB/3T3 fibroblasts and early passage human dermal fibroblasts. The data in Fig. 2also imply that serum or mitogen inhibition of CNP signaling is acute in that it therefore appears reversible under chronic conditions. Reversible changes in signaling pathways are important, and since fibroblasts in the proximity of a wound are continuously exposed to high levels of mitogens (1Clark R.A.F. Clark R.A.F. The Molecular and Cellular Biology of Wound Repair. 2nd Ed. Plenum Publishing Corp., New York1995: 3-50Google Scholar), it is important to determine the effects of such conditions on CNP responsiveness. Basal, CNP-stimulated, and Mn2+/Triton-stimulated guanylyl cyclase activities in homogenates were determined at different times during an 8-h exposure of quiescent GC-B/3T3 fibroblasts to 10% serum (Fig.8). Basal and CNP-stimulated guanylyl cyclase activities sharply decreased during the initial 1 h of serum treatment but recovered to control levels by 6 h despite the continued presence of serum. The recovery of guanylyl cyclase activity corresponded well with the ability of CNP to elevate cyclic GMP in intact cells (not shown) and the phosphorylation state of the cyclase (not shown). This is consistent with covalent regulation of natriuretic peptide receptor-guanylyl cyclases through phosphorylation previously seen in broken cells (44Foster D.F. Garbers D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16311-16318Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Although CNP responses changed with time, both total guanylyl cyclase activity, as measured in the presence of Mn2+/Triton, and the expression level of the cyclase remained constant. The cyclase therefore appears to be reversibly regulated by covalent modification catalyzed by one or more protein kinases/phosphoprotein phosphatases, at least some of which are mitogen-sensitive. Following rapid serum inactivation of the cyclase CNP signaling is reestablished prior to the onset of DNA synthesis and mitosis, 9In BALB/3T3 fibroblasts “early G1” ends at 6 h and S phase begins about 12 h after PDGF exposure (30Pledger W.J.

Stiles C.D. Antoniades H.N. Scher C.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 4481-4485Crossref PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar). As the cell exits mitosis and is again sensitive to extracellular mitogens, 10As cells pass the restriction point in G1, they become refractory to extracellular mitogens presumably regaining full mitogen sensitivity upon completion of the cell cycle (46Sherr C.J. Science. 1996; 274: 1672-1677Crossref PubMed Scopus (4960) Google Scholar). it again responds to CNP. The simultaneous, similar, and consistent but opposite effects of serum, PDGF, and Na3VO4 on CNP- and mitogen-signaling pathways strongly suggest that suppression of CNP signaling and activation of the MAP kinase cascade are functionally linked. Rapid changes in mitogen levels likely occur at the site of a wound as platelets release large amounts of mitogenic/chemotactic factors such as PDGF. In this context, where fibroblasts are attracted to the wound or stimulated to proliferate, signaling pathways antagonistic to proliferation or migration are likely suppressed. Clearly the acute suppression of GC-B ligand-dependent as well as CNP-independent activity by mitogens is an early event in their signaling pathways. The reversible nature of the inhibition is also physiologically important, but the mechanism of reversibility (mitogen receptor desensitization or signaling pathway component desensitization) remains unknown."

Both enzymes were expressed as major membrane proteins, accounting for ∼5–8% of the total membrane protein. Using nickel chelate affinity chromatography, the HASs were purified to homogeneity fromn-dodecyl β-d-maltoside extracts. High levels of HAS activity could be achieved only if the purified enzymes were supplemented with either bovine or E. coli cardiolipin (CL), although bovine CL gave consistently greater activity. Mass spectroscopic analysis revealed that the fatty acid compositions of these two CL preparations did not overlap. The two HAS enzymes showed similar but distinct activation profiles with the 10 other lipids tested. For example, phosphatidic acid and phosphatidylethanolamine stimulated seHAS, but not spHAS. Phosphatidylserine stimulated both enzymes. spHAS appears to be more CL-specific than seHAS, although both purified enzymes still contain endogenous CL that can not easily be removed. Both seHAS and spHAS were inhibited by phosphatidylcholine, sphingomyelin, and sulfatides and were not substantially stimulated by cerebrosides, phosphatidylglycerol, or phosphatidylinositol. With both HASs, CL increased the K m for UDP-GlcUA, but decreased the K m for UDP-GlcNAc and gave an overall stimulation of V max.

Both purified enzymes also lost activity over 4–5 days when stored at –80 °C in the presence of CL, but reached a level of activity that then slowly decreased over a period of months. Although the purified enzymes stored in the absence of CL at −80 °C were much less active, the enzymes retained this same low level of activity for at least 5 weeks. When both spHAS and seHAS were stored without CL at −80 °C, even after 2 months, they could be stimulated by the addition of bovine CL to ∼60% of the initial activity of the freshly purified enzyme.

In this study, we have detergent-solubilized and purified to homogeneity the active recombinant spHAS and seHAS enzymes expressed in Escherichia coli. We have also determined that these purified HASs, in the absence of other streptococcal proteins, are lipid-dependent enzymes that are strongly stimulated by CL.

The pKK223-3 vector contains the strong tac promoter that can be regulated by the lac repressor and induced with isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactoside. To facilitate purification of spHAS and seHAS, a C-terminal fusion of 6 His residues was introduced into each construct. This modification does not significantly alter enzyme activity (24DeAngelis P.L. Weigel P.H. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 9033-9039Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Membranes from S. pyogenes and S. equisimilis were obtained as described in the accompanying paper (32Tlapak-Simmons V.L. Baggenstoss B.A. Kumari K. Heldermon C. Weigel P.H. J. Biol.

The thawed membrane pellets were solubilized using 9.8 mm DDM (0.5%, w/v) in extraction buffer (50 mm sodium and potassium phosphate, pH 7.0, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 1.0 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 20% glycerol, 0.5 μg/ml leupeptin, 0.7 μg/ml pepstatin, and 46 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) at 4 °C for 2 h with gentle mixing in a Micromixer (Taitec). Insoluble membrane components were sedimented by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 1 h, and imidazole was then added to the supernatant to a final concentration of 20 mm to minimize nonspecific binding of E. coliproteins to the Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid resin (QIAGEN Inc.). The final extract was applied directly to a mini-spin column (Bio-Rad) containing Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid resin, which had been equilibrated with extraction buffer lacking MgCl2. The enzyme was incubated with the resin for 90 min at 4 °C with constant mixing. After incubation, the flow-through fraction from the Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid resin was passed over the resin four times (on ice). The resin was then washed with 10 volumes of extraction buffer, and the HAS was eluted with 25 mm sodium and potassium phosphate, pH 7.0, 50 mm NaCl, 1.0 mm dithiothreitol, 20% (v/v) glycerol, 0.98 mm DDM, 0.5 μg/ml leupeptin, 0.7 μg/ml pepstatin, 46 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and various concentrations of histidine. For certain experiments, this elution buffer also contained CL. spHAS and seHAS were solubilized, purified, and stored with or without the addition of bovine heart or E. coli CL depending on the type of experiment. Exposure to, or the presence of, histidine did not affect the activity of either HAS. Protein concentrations were determined with the Coomassie protein assay reagent (Pierce) using bovine serum albumin as the standard (33Bradford M.M. Anal.

HAS activity was determined in 100 μl of 25 mm sodium and potassium phosphate, pH 7.0, containing 50 mm NaCl, 20 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm EGTA, 15-20% glycerol, 1 mm UDP-GlcUA (Fluka), and 0.8 μmUDP-[14C]GlcUA (267 mCi/mmol; ICN). When assaying spHAS, 1.5 mm UDP-GlcNAc was used, whereas 1.0 mmUDP-GlcNAc was used to assay seHAS. DDM (0.98 mm) was also present in assays with the purified HAS. Depending on the type of experiment, various concentrations of CL were also added to the assay buffer. To initiate the enzyme reaction, 3 μg of whole membrane protein or 0.3–0.5 μg of pure HAS was added, and the mixtures were gently mixed in a Micromixer at 30 °C for 1 h. The reactions were terminated and analyzed as described (34Tlapak-Simmons V.L. Kempner E.S. Baggenstoss B.A. Weigel P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26100-26109Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Samples were prepared for SDS-PAGE as described by Laemmli (35Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207538) Google Scholar). Briefly, the samples were incubated with buffer containing 10 mm dithiothreitol and 2% (w/v) SDS for 2 h at 42 °C before loading onto 1-mm 12% (w/v) polyacrylamide gels. The gels were electrophoresed using a Bio-Rad Mini-PROTEAN II at 25 mA until the dye reached the running gel interface, at which point, the current was held constant at 40 mA. The gels were stained with Coomassie Blue R-250 for 30 min and destained with 25% methanol and 10% acetic acid. After SDS-PAGE, proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose (0.1 μm; Schleicher & Schuell) using a Bio-Rad Mini-Transblot device at 90 V for 2 h in buffer with 20% methanol and 0.01% (w/v) SDS as described by Towbin et al. (36Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44939) Google Scholar). The blots were blocked, incubated with a specific polyclonal antibody to the spHAS sequence Glu147–Thr161, and developed as described previously (24DeAngelis P.L. Weigel P.H. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 9033-9039Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). spHAS and seHAS, containing C-terminal His6 tails, were affinity-purified using nickel chelate chromatography. Conditions were chosen so that at least 95% of each protein was solubilized from isolated membranes and recovered in the DDM detergent extracts. Overall, only a 15–17-fold purification was needed to obtain homogeneous preparations (Table I) since at least 5–8% of the total E. coli membrane protein can be the recombinant HAS (27Kumari K. Weigel P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32539-32546Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Based on SDS-PAGE followed by Coomassie Blue staining (Fig. 1) or Western analysis (data not shown), the affinity-purified spHAS and seHAS were >99% pure. Both spHAS and seHAS migrated anonymously fast on SDS-PAGE and give relative molecular masses of 42–43 kDa, although the calculated molecular masses based on amino acid sequence were 48,677 and 48,600 Da, respectively, for the two enzymes containing a His6tail. These predicted molecular masses were, in fact, found to be accurate within 0.07% by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry (34Tlapak-Simmons V.L. Kempner E.S. Baggenstoss B.A. Weigel P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26100-26109Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Despite their almost identical masses, we observed that seHAS consistently migrated slightly slower than spHAS, giving a greater apparent molecular mass of ∼l kDa (Fig. 1, lanes 8 and9).Table IPurification of spHAS and seHASTotal proteinSpecific activityaThe addition of 2 mm bovine CL substantially increased the specific activity of purified spHAS and seHAS, respectively, to 20 and 35 nmol/μg/h.Total activityYieldbThe activity of the extracted enzymes increased after solubilization with DDM.

Open table in a new tab We recently found that the activity of recombinant spHAS or seHAS is stimulated when exogenous CL is added to purified E. colimembranes (34Tlapak-Simmons V.L. Kempner E.S. Baggenstoss B.A. Weigel P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26100-26109Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Triscott and van de Rijn (21Triscott M.X. van de Rijn I. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 6004-6009Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) also found that digitonin-solubilized seHAS was stimulated by CL. Based on these results, we investigated the influence of CL and other lipids on HAS activity as well as on HAS purification and stability during storage. When either spHAS (Fig. 2) or seHAS (Fig.3) was purified under CL-deficient conditions, the re-addition of CL caused a large increase in enzyme activity. As the CL concentration was increased, the specific activity of both enzymes also increased. In both cases, there was an apparent critical concentration of ∼0.5 mm CL required before HAS activity was stimulated. The stimulation of HAS activity with CL occurred almost immediately, in <1 min (data not shown). With spHAS, bovine or E. coli CL gave similar results (Fig. 2), although bovine CL consistently resulted in a significantly higher specific activity: a 11.5-fold stimulation compared with a 9-fold increase at 3 mm. The seHAS enzyme behaved in a qualitatively similar manner (Fig. 3), although the difference between bovine and E. coli CL was greater, and the overall stimulation of HAS activity was less than that found for spHAS. Consistent with this result, the residual HAS activity without exogenous CL was always considerably higher (e.g. ∼7-fold) for seHAS compared with spHAS.Figure 3Effect of cardiolipin on the activity of purified seHAS. seHAS was purified as described under “Experimental Procedures,” except that exogenous CL was omitted at each step. The freshly purified enzyme was then assayed in the presence of the indicated final concentrations of either bovine (■) orE. coli (▪) CL.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The difference in the ability of the bovine and E. coli CL preparations to stimulate either seHAS or spHAS was unexpected, especially since the enzyme was expressed in and purified from E. coli, which is known to contain CL (37Dowhan W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 199-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (789) Google Scholar). To assess the molecular basis for this different ability to stimulate, we examined the composition of these lipids using MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry (Fig.4). Interestingly, the two CL preparations were quite different and, in fact, did not share any of the same CL species. Since CL contains four fatty acyl chains and there are dozens of different possible fatty acids that can be linked at each position, there are many possible CL isoforms. Bovine CL contained essentially one species (>90%) with the major mass peak at 1447.93, which was not present in the bacterial CL. E. coli CL was much more complex, containing at least seven different CL species ranging in mass from 1335.91 to 1432.09. These seven species constitute a series with each member differing in mass by 14 or one -CH2 group. A variety of other phospholipids were also tested for their ability to stimulate HAS activity. Freshly purified spHAS (Fig.5) and seHAS (Fig.6) were both stimulated to the greatest extent by bovine CL and to the next greatest extent by phosphatidylserine. spHAS showed the greater specificity for CL since none of the other 10 lipids tested gave a specific activity of >30% of that with bovine CL (Fig. 5). The only other lipids to give a moderate stimulation of spHAS activity were lysolecithin, cerebrosides, and phosphatidylserine. Phosphatidylserine was the second best activating lipid, with a 2.5-fold stimulation of activity. The basal activity of purified spHAS was actually inhibited in the presence of phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidic acid, phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylinositol, phosphatidylglycerol, sphingomyelin, and sulfatides (Fig. 5).Figure 6Effect of various lipids on seHAS activity. Freshly purified seHAS, prepared in the absence of added CL, was assayed in the presence of the indicated lipids as described in the legend to Fig. 5.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The results with seHAS were qualitatively similar, but quantitatively different (Fig. 6). The basal activity of purified seHAS was also inhibited by phosphatidylcholine, sphingomyelin, and sulfatides. Both enzymes were essentially inactive in the presence of this latter anionic lipid. Like spHAS, seHAS was moderately stimulated by lysolecithin and cerebrosides, but unlike spHAS, seHAS was also weakly stimulated by phosphatidylinositol and phosphatidylethanolamine. Perhaps the biggest difference between the two enzymes was the effect of phosphatidic acid, which stimulated seHAS >4-fold (Fig. 6), but inhibited spHAS (Fig. 5). We conclude from these data that seHAS and spHAS are very sensitive to the phospholipids in their environment and are essentially dependent on CL. The large increase in synthase activity with CL could be due to a CL-dependent effect on the enzyme that decreases theK m values for the sugar nucleotide substrates or that only increases V max. To determine this, the kinetic profiles of both purified enzymes were measured in the absence and presence of bovine CL (Fig. 7 and Table II). In the absence of CL, both freshly purified enzymes had responses to increasing UDP-GlcUA similar to those shown in Figs. 2 and 4 for the membrane-bound enzymes, but they had very different responses to UDP-GlcNAc (Fig. 7). Detergent-solubilized, purified spHAS without CL showed the same sigmoidal response to increasing UDP-GlcNAc as observed for the membrane-bound enzyme (32Tlapak-Simmons V.L.

The Hill number in this case was 2.0, whereas the value for pure seHAS without CL was 1.1, indicating no cooperativity for UDP-GlcNAc utilization (Table II). The addition of CL decreased the K UDP-GlcNAc of both HASs by ∼65%. Interestingly, the effect of CL onK UDP-GlcUA was in the opposite direction. With both enzymes, CL caused a 4–10-fold increase in theK m for UDP-GlcUA. Although CL had opposite effects on the HAS efficiency for utilizing each substrate, the overall effect on enzyme activity was highly favorable since CL increased theV max of both enzymes 3.6–6-fold. A more complete kinetic characterization of the HASs in the presence of CL is presented in the accompanying paper (32Tlapak-Simmons V.L. Baggenstoss B.A. Kumari K. Heldermon C. Weigel P.H. J. Biol.

We also investigated conditions that would allow the long-term storage of the purified HAS enzymes with good retention of activity. At 4 °C, with or without CL, the enzymes were inactive by day 5 (data not shown). When affinity-purified spHAS (Fig.8 A) or seHAS (Fig.8 B) was stored for weeks with or without CL at −80 °C, enzyme activity was retained, but changed substantially. Most typically, at −80 °C with CL, both enzymes lost ∼20–50% of their activity within 4–5 days. Storage of purified seHAS or spHAS at −80 °C with 2 mm bovine CL usually yielded a relatively stable level of HAS activity from day 5 through at least day 34. For both enzymes, storage in the presence of bovine CL was better than withE. coli CL. Both enzymes consistently displayed an unusual biphasic, changing activity pattern during the first week of storage at −80 °C.

We conclude that porphyrinogenesis as a result of deregulated tetrapyrrole synthesis induces a set of defense responses that resemble the hypersensitive reaction observed after pathogen attack. All organisms contain tetrapyrroles that play important roles in the transfer of energy, redox sensing, or catalysis. Chlorophylls are the most abundant tetrapyrroles in plants and are involved in the harvesting of light and its subsequent conversion to chemical energy. In response to varying environmental conditions the coordinated synthesis and stoichiometric assembly of the components of the photosynthetic complexes ensure an adjusted electron flow and avoid exacerbated oxidant production (1Foyer C.H. Harbinson J. Foyer C.H. Mullineaux P.M. Causes of Photo-oxidative Stress and Amelioration of Defense Systems in Plants. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1994: 1-42Google Scholar). In addition to the regulatory mechanisms, plants have evolved effective protection systems against photooxidative stress consisting of enzymic and low molecular weight antioxidants (2Asada K. Baker N.R. Photosynthesis and the Environment. Kluwer Academic Publishers Group, Dordrecht, The Netherlands1996: 123-150Google Scholar). Genetic or chemical impairment of chlorophyll or heme biosynthesis results in the accumulation of photosensitizing tetrapyrroles,e.g. by feeding of the precursor 5-aminolevulinate or by application of diphenyl ether herbicides acting on protoporphyrinogen oxidase (3Spikes J.D. Bommer J.C. Scheer H. Chlorophylls. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1991: 1181-1204Google Scholar). Formation of reactive oxygen species such as singlet oxygen is essential for the photodynamic action of tetrapyrroles (3Spikes J.D. Bommer J.C. Scheer H. Chlorophylls. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1991: 1181-1204Google Scholar). Expression of antisense or additional sense genes encoding enzymes of the tetrapyrrole metabolism leads to modified enzymic activities and, in consequence, to an imbalance of the substrate flow. Transgenic tobacco plants with reduced uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase (UROD) 1The abbreviations used are: UROD, uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase; CGA, chlorogenic acid; CPO, coproporphyrinogen oxidase; ES-MS, electrospray-mass spectrometry; PR, pathogenesis related protein; SA, salicylic acid; TMV, tobacco mosaic virus; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography. or coproporphyrinogen oxidase (CPO) were characterized by light-dependent formation of leaf lesions and by stunted growth (4Kruse E. Mock H.-P. Grimm B. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3712-3720Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 5Mock H.-P. Grimm B. Plant Physiol. 1997; 113: 1101-1112Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Reduced activity of either of the two enzymes may increase the level of porphyrinogen substrates up to 500-fold in transformants relative to control plants. These compounds, predominantly uroporphyrinogen or coproporphyrinogen in UROD or CPO antisense plants, respectively, can be photooxidized, thus triggering photodynamic cellular destruction. Cellular stress responses observed upon accumulation of these tetrapyrroles included increased steady state levels of antioxidant mRNAs and increased activity of enzymes involved in stress defense. In particular, higher activities of superoxide dismutase in younger leaves and of ascorbate peroxidase in older leaves were observed (6Mock H.-P. Keetman U. Kruse E. Rank B. Grimm B. Plant Physiol. 1998; 116: 107-116Crossref Scopus (47) Google Scholar). In addition to the plastidic superoxide dismutase isoform, mitochondrial and cytosolic isoforms contributed to the increased total enzyme activity suggesting that tetrapyrroles initially synthesized in the plastids may spread to other compartments where they induce local antioxidative defense responses (6Mock H.-P. Keetman U. Kruse E. Rank B. Grimm B. Plant Physiol. 1998; 116: 107-116Crossref Scopus (47) Google Scholar). However, limitation of the detoxifying system was indicated by a decrease in the total content and a higher percentage of the oxidized form of ascorbate, reduced content of glutathione, and the loss of tocopherol (4Kruse E. Mock H.-P. Grimm B. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3712-3720Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 6Mock H.-P. Keetman U. Kruse E. Rank B. Grimm B. Plant Physiol. 1998; 116: 107-116Crossref Scopus (47) Google Scholar). In addition to the well established roles of these protective components, phenolic constituents also contribute to the antioxidative capacity of cells (7Bors W. Heller W. Michel C. Saran M. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 186: 343-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (1626) Google Scholar, 8Rice-Evans C.A. Miller N.J. Paganga G. Trends Plant Sci. 1997; 2: 152-159Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (3417) Google Scholar). Different phenylpropanoids are formed in response to various stresses such as wounding, high light, UV radiation, or pathogen attack. These molecules often exert antimicrobial and UV protecting or signaling functions (9Dixon R.A. Paiva N.L. Plant Cell. 1995; 7: 1085-1097Crossref PubMed Scopus (3660) Google Scholar). We have continued to examine the protective responses to oxidative stress following the accumulation of tetrapyrroles in UROD and CPO antisense plants with the analysis of phenolic constituents and found an increased content of the coumarin scopolin which is also synthesized in tobacco upon TMV infection (10Fritig B. Hirth L. Acta Phytopathol. Acad. Sci. Hung. 1971; 6: 21-29Google Scholar, 11Tanguy J. Martin C. Phytochemistry. 1972; 11: 19-28Crossref Scopus (52) Google Scholar). We demonstrate that other pathogen defense responses are also activated indicating that these cellular reactions upon porphyrinogenesis resemble a hypersensitive reaction after pathogen attack. Tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum var. Samsun NN) plants expressing antisense RNA for CPO (4Kruse E. Mock H.-P. Grimm B. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3712-3720Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) or UROD (5Mock H.-P. Grimm B. Plant Physiol. 1997; 113: 1101-1112Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) and control plants (Samsun NN) were grown under controlled environmental conditions (24 °C, 300 μmol of photons m−2s−1, 16/8-h light/dark cycles) that favor development of necrotic leaf lesions in the transformants (5Mock H.-P. Grimm B. Plant Physiol. 1997; 113: 1101-1112Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). For biochemical analysis plant material from progenies of line 2 of UROD and line 3 of CPO antisense plants was harvested as described previously (6Mock H.-P. Keetman U. Kruse E. Rank B. Grimm B. Plant Physiol. 1998; 116: 107-116Crossref Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Additional lines were used for the TMV infection experiment (Fig. 7), and these have also been characterized previously (4Kruse E. Mock H.-P. Grimm B. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3712-3720Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 5Mock H.-P. Grimm B. Plant Physiol. 1997; 113: 1101-1112Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Necrotic leaves from individual plants with lesion formation and leaves of the same developmental stage of transformants without lesion formation as well as wild-type plants were used for inoculation. For comparative studies of necrotic and non-necrotic leaf areas of transformants, tissue was separately harvested from the same leaf, and for each single experiment, material was pooled from several leaves. The plant material used for biochemical analysis was frozen in liquid nitrogen, ground to a fine powder with a mortar and a pestle, and stored at −80 °C until further processing. Acetobromo-α-d-glucose, silver(I) oxide, and pyridine were purchased from Fluka (Neu-Ulm, Germany). Drierite and 1,4-diazabicyclo(2,2,2)octane were obtained from Aldrich (Steinheim, Germany). Scopoletin was purchased from Roth (Karlsruhe, Germany). HPLC gradient grade methanol was obtained from Riedel-de-Haen (Seelze, Germany). Other chemicals were obtained from Merck (Darmstadt, Germany) or Sigma (Deisenhofen, Germany), and all chemicals were of analytical or the highest purity available. Pre-coated TLC plates SIL G-200 UV254 were purchased from Macherey und Nagel (Düren, Germany). Aliquots of powdered plant material were extracted repeatedly with methanol in Eppendorf tubes (final volume 1 ml). Homogenization was accomplished by a motor-driven pestle which fitted into the Eppendorf tubes. Extracts were centrifuged at 13,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. Phenolic constituents were analyzed on an HPLC system consisting of a Waters 600 controller and pump unit and a Waters 996 photodiode array detector (Waters, Eschborn, Germany) combined with a fluorescence detector (FP-920, JASCO, Groß-Umstadt, Germany). Data acquisition and processing were performed with the Millenium software package (Waters, Eschborn, Germany). Methanolic extracts were diluted with 0.25 volume of water and centrifuged again. Aliquots of the supernatants were injected and separated on a RP-18 phase column (LiChrospher, 5 μm, 125-4; Merck, Darmstadt, Germany). The mobile phase used consisted of 0.1% ammonium formate in 2% formic acid (solvent A) and 90% methanol in solvent A (solvent B) as described previously (12Heller W. Rosemann D. Osswald W.F. Benz B. Schönwitz R. Lohwasser K. Kloos M. Sandermann Jr., H. Environ. Pollut. 1990; 64: 353-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) but with a slightly modified gradient profile. After 5 min elution with 100% solvent A, a gradient from 0 to 40% solvent B over 25 min was applied followed by a gradient from 40% solvent B to 100% B over further 20 min. Spectra from 250 to 400 nm were recorded (1/s) at maximal spectral resolution of the photodiode array detector (1.2 nm), and chromatograms of absorbance at 280 nm were extracted from these data sets. The wavelength settings for the fluorescence detector were 300 nm for excitation and 400 nm for emission. Chlorogenic acid was identified as the major peak in the UV chromatograms (280 nm) in methanolic extracts of wild-type leaves or roots. This peak eluted with the same retention time and displayed an identical diode array spectrum as authentic chlorogenic acid (CGA) in the HPLC analysis. For subsequent MS analysis of the major constituent, appropriate fractions were collected after HPLC and monitoring at 280 nm, evaporated to dryness, and redissolved in 50% methanol, 2% acetic acid. The purity of the preparation was confirmed by HPLC. ES-MS spectra were recorded on a Bruker Esquire ion trap system (Bruker Franzen, Bremen, Germany) equipped with an API interface (Analytica, Branford, CT). The mass spectrometer was operated in the positive ion mode with a resolution of 0.4 atomic mass units. Samples were infused at a flow rate of 80 μl h−1. A temperature of 150 °C was set for the drying gas (nitrogen). Helium was used as a gas for collision-induced dissociation. Authentic CGA and purified plant extracts with tentatively identified CGA both exhibited a peak atm/z = 355 corresponding to the (M + H+) ion. For the identification of scopolin, 3 g of powdered plant material was extracted in 50 ml of methanol (30 min, 4 °C). The extract was centrifuged (15 min, 6,000 × g). The supernatant was evaporated to dryness, redissolved in 500 μl of methanol, and adjusted to 20% methanol by addition of water. After centrifugation (15 min, 6,000 × g) 200-μl aliquots were injected for HPLC. To allow better separation of scopolin and chlorogenic acid, the mobile phase was as follows: 5% methanol (solvent A1) and 80% methanol (solvent B1) and a gradient from 0 to 50% B1 over 30 min. Elution was monitored by UV absorbance at 280 nm. Scopolin eluting at 19 min was collected from several injections, evaporated to dryness, and redissolved either in acetate buffer (50 mm, pH 5) for subsequent digestion with β-glucosidase, or in 50% methanol, 2% acetic acid for MS analysis. The purity of the scopolin preparation was confirmed by HPLC using the standard separation system described for phenolic constituents. For β-glucosidase digestion, aliquots of isolated scopolin were redissolved in acetate buffer (50 mm, pH 5) and incubated at 37 °C for 30 min in the presence of 1 unit of almond β-glucosidase (Sigma, Deisenhofen, Germany) dissolved in the same buffer. Control experiments with buffer alone were run in parallel. Samples were then transferred to ice, and 4 volumes of methanol were added. After centrifugation, aliquots of the supernatant were spiked with either scopoletin or isoscopoletin dissolved in 80% methanol or 80% methanol alone and analyzed by HPLC using the standard separation system and fluorescence detection. The chemical synthesis of scopolin was essentially according to Ref. 13Schuster B. Winter M. Herrmann K. Z.

A mixture of 38.4 mg of scopoletin (0.2 mmol), 90.4 mg of acetobromoglucose (0.22 mmol), 46.4 mg of silver(I) oxide (0.2 mmol), 56 mg of drierite (calcium sulfate, 0.4 mmol), and 1 mg of 1,4-diazabicyclo(2,2,2)octane in 1 ml of dry pyridine were mixed in an Eppendorf tube and stirred overnight in the dark. After centrifugation the supernatant was separated and the solvent removed under a stream of nitrogen. The residue was dissolved in 0.5 ml of trichloromethane and applied to a preparative silica gel plate purified twice before use with trichloromethane/methanol 1:1 (v/v) containing 2% (v/v) acetic acid. The plate was developed with trichloromethane/glacial acetic acid/water, 70:28:2 (v/v/v), and air-dried. The band at R f = 0.8–0.9 ahead of the residual scopoletin was scraped off, the scopolin tetraacetate eluted with trichloromethane/methanol, 8:2 (v/v), and the solvent removedin vacuo. The crude scopolin tetraacetate was treated with 5 ml of 0.5 m barium hydroxide at 80 °C for 15 min, and the reaction mixture was then cooled to room temperature and brought to pH 7 with 2 m sulfuric acid. The barium sulfate formed was precipitated by centrifugation, the supernatant separated, and the solvent removed in vacuo. The residue was chromatographed on Sephadex LH2O (Pharmacia, Freiburg, Germany) with methanol, and the scopolin characterized by HPLC combined with diode-array spectroscopy and by mass spectrometry as described under “Results.” Analysis of conjugated and free SA was performed essentially according to Ref. 14Meuwly P. Métraux J.P. Anal. Biochem. 1993; 214: 500-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar, with the following minor modifications: 200 mg of powdered leaf material was used for extraction, and trichloroacetic acid was replaced by 20% formic acid. The preparations were finally resuspended in 20% methanol prior to HPLC analysis which was performed using the HPLC system described above with fluorescence detection. The mobile phase consisted of solvent A and solvent B2 (80% methanol and 10% acetonitrile in solvent A), and the column was kept at 30 °C. Elution was performed at a flow rate of 1 ml min−1 with a hyperbolic gradient from 10% solvent B to 45% B in 25 min using curve 5 offered by the Millenium software. The column was then washed with 100% solvent B and equilibrated. Salicylic acid eluted at 16.4 min. Recovery rates for each individual experiment were determined by spiking parallel samples with appropriate amounts of authentic SA. Hand-cut cross-sections of leaves were mounted in water and viewed under a Zeiss Axiovert microscope with a Fluar 20 × 0.75 UV. The filter combination used was as follows: excitation BP 365, DBS 395; emission LP 397. Photos were taken using a Kodak Elite 400 slide film. Protein extraction, SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and immunoblotting were performed as described previously (4Kruse E. Mock H.-P. Grimm B.

Antisera raised against tobacco PR proteins PR-1c, -2, -Q, and -S were a gift of Drs. P. Geoffroy and B. Fritig (Université Louis Pasteur, Straßbourg, France). The immunospecificity of the antisera has been described (see Ref. 16Heitz T. Fritig B. Legrand M. Mol.

Samsun NN tobacco plants, a local lesion host for TMV, UROD, and CPO antisense plants were grown under controlled conditions favoring development of necrotic lesions (6Mock H.-P. Keetman U. Kruse E. Rank B. Grimm B. Plant Physiol. 1998; 116: 107-116Crossref Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Ten-week-old plants were inoculated with a suspension of the Flavum strain of TMV (0.5 mg/liter) in a solution of 10 mmsodium phosphate (pH 7) containing carborundum as described previously (17Ward E.R. Uknes S.J. Williams S.C. Dincher S.S. Wiederhold D.L. Alexander D.C. Ahl-Goy P. Métraux J.-P. Ryals J.A. Plant Cell. 1991; 3: 1085-1094Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In parallel, other plants were mock-inoculated with buffer and carborundum only. At least two leaves per plant and five plants per transgenic line or wild-type were used for inoculation. Leaves were harvested directly before and 5 days after TMV inoculation, and total RNA was isolated by phenol/chloroform extraction followed by lithium chloride precipitation (18Lagrimini L.M. Burkhart W. Moyer M. Rothstein S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 7542-7546Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Total RNA (7.5 μg) was subjected to electrophoresis on formaldehyde/agarose gels and blotted to Hybond-N membranes (Amersham, Braunschweig, Germany) as described (19Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. 1st Ed. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1987Google Scholar). Equal loading of samples was confirmed by including 40 μg/ml ethidium bromide in the sample loading buffer allowing visualization of RNA under UV light. 32P-Labeled probes were synthesized using the random primers DNA-labeling system (Life Technologies, Inc.). The cDNA probes for tobacco PR-1 and reverse-transcribed TMV-RNA have been previously described (20Friedrich L. Lawton K. Ruess W. Masner P. Specker N. Gut-Rella M. Meier B. Dincher S. Staub T.

Relative amounts of TMV transcripts were quantified using a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Fig.1 shows chromatograms obtained from methanolic extracts of leaf 9 of a UROD antisense plant. The main peak observed by UV detection at 280 nm (24.6 min) (Fig. 1 A) was identified as chlorogenic acid (CGA) by co-chromatography with authentic CGA, combined with diode array and electrospray mass spectrometry (ES-MS) as described under “Experimental Procedures.” In leaf extracts of transgenic plants the chromatograms recorded by using fluorescence detection showed a dominant peak (24.4 min) eluting very close to CGA (24.9 min) (Fig. 1 B). This peak corresponded to the small signal observed at 24.1 min in the UV chromatogram (Fig. 1 A, see arrow). The insert in Fig. 1 A shows the diode array spectrum of this peak. This compound was absent in UV chromatograms in extracts of wild-type plants (data not shown), and only a small signal was found by fluorescence detection (Fig. 1 C). Comparing the integrated peak areas obtained from control and transformed plants on a fresh weight basis, the content of this compound was increased (up to 23-fold) in leaves of the transformants (see Table I below). The content of other constituents remained unchanged or differed only slightly in leaves of control and transformed plants.Table IAccumulation of scopolin in leaves of UROD and CPO antisense plants relative to wild-typeAmount of scopolinWTURODASCPOASnmol/g fresh weightLeaf 55.56 ± 0.5782.72 ± 1.5628.09 ± 0.25Leaf 72.78 ± 0.3364.12 ± 0.827.94 ± 0.32Leaf 91.97 ± 0.4145.95 ± 0.4913.92 ± 0.42Leaf 111.47 ± 0.0834.07 ± 0.1618.76 ± 0.44Methanolic leaf extracts of wild-type (WT), CPO (CPOAS), or UROD (URODAS) antisense plants were subjected to HPLC analysis on RP-18 as described for Fig. 1.

Chemically synthesized scopolin was used for calibration. Results from a typical experiment are shown. Each value represents the mean ± S.D. of three separate extractions. Leaves were counted from the top to the base. Leaves of transformants were harvested without separating necrotic and non-necrotic areas. Based on the strong fluorescence (22Dieterman L.J. Lin S.-Y. Rohrbaugh L.M. Thiesfeld V. Wender S.H. Anal. Biochem. 1964; 9: 139-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) and on the UV spectrum (see inset, Fig. 1 A (23Dieterman L.J. Lin S.-Y. Rohrbaugh L.M. Wender S.H. Biochem. Biophys. 1964; 106: 275-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar)), we tentatively identified the unknown substance as a coumarin. The metabolite was isolated from necrotic leaves of UROD antisense plants by HPLC as described under “Experimental Procedures.” It was identified as scopolin based on HPLC analysis of a β-glucosidase digest, mass spectrometry, and comparison with authentic standards. The isolated compound was incubated with or without β-glucosidase and separated by HPLC (Fig. 2). After glucosidase digestion the fluorescent peak at 24 min completely disappeared, and one new peak of approximately the same fluorescence intensity became apparent. The retention time of this product was identical to that of scopoletin, the aglycon of scopolin, as demonstrated by cochromatography with authentic scopoletin (Fig.2 B). The product released by β-glucosidase also displayed the same diode array spectrum as scopoletin (data not shown). Isoscopoletin clearly differed in its elution time (28.9 min) under the same chromatographic conditions and showed a much lower ratio of peak areas from fluorescence to UV detection (data not shown). Analysis of the isolated metabolite by electrospray-mass spectrometry (ES-MS) gave a mono-isotopic mass of 354.1 identical with the value of 354.1 calculated for scopolin, C16H18O9. The collision-induced fragmentation of the protonated molecular ion produced one intense fragment ion at m/z 193.0 (Fig.3) resulting from the loss of the glucose moiety. The appearance of this ion and a simultaneous reduction in intensity of the protonated molecular ion at 355.1 was observed when the temperature of the drying gas was elevated (data not shown). The chemical structure was further confirmed by chemical synthesis of scopolin from scopoletin and acetobromoglucose. The product obtained after alkaline hydrolysis of the tetra-acetyl intermediate was identical to the compound isolated from necrotic leaves of UROD antisense plants when analyzed by the methods described. In addition, both preparations gave an identical pattern of product ions when the molecular ions at m/z 193 were further fragmented (data not shown). The content of scopolin in leaves of transformants and controls was quantified using the chemically synthesized compound for calibration (Table I).Figure 3ES-MS/MS spectrum of scopolin isolated from methanolic leaf extracts of UROD antisense plants. The ES-MS showed a (M + H+) ion peak at m/z = 355 consistent with the monoisotopic mass of 354.1 as calculated for scopolin. The protonated molecular ion at m/z 355 was isolated in the ion trap and was fragmented resulting in the appearance of one prominent product ion at m/z = 193.0 indicating the loss of the glucose moiety.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The content of scopolin was quantified in leaf tissue with or without visible necrotic lesions from UROD (Fig.4 A) and CPO (Fig.4 B) antisense plants. Necrotic and non-necrotic leaf tissues were defined as indicated in Fig. 4 C. In both transgenic lines the amount of scopolin was more than 10-fold higher in the necrotic tissue compared with non-necrotic areas. The high content of scopolin and its predominance among the fluorescent compounds found in methanol extracts prompted us to investigate the subcellular localization of this compound in leaf tissues of transformants. Fig.5 shows leaf sections of a necrotic (Fig.5 A) and a non-necrotic area (Fig. 5 B) from the same leaf of a UROD antisense plant visualized by fluorescence microscopy. A white to bright-bluish fluorescence in the sections of necrotized leaves coincided with dead tissue. Around this tissue, a strong deep-blue fluorescence surrounded by a layer of red fluorescence was visible in cells of both the palisade and spongy parenchyma. The deep-blue fluorescence indicated the accumulation of scopolin in the vacuoles. Non-necrotic sections of necrotized leaves from UROD antisense plants (Fig. 5 B) displayed similar intensity of the red fluorescence, whereas the deep-blue fluorescence was considerably lower, consistent with the quantitative analysis of scopolin (Fig. 4). Fluorescence analysis of necrotic and non-necrotic leaf sections of CPO antisense plants gave similar results (data not shown).Figure 5Fluorescence microscopy of a necrotic and a non-necrotic leaf area of a UROD antisense plant.

TMV infection of tobacco induces the expression of PR proteins including β-glucanases (class two of tobacco PR proteins), chitinases (e.g. PR Q), as well as other proteins of unknown function (24Bol J.F. Linthorst H.J.M. Cornelissen B.J.C. Annu. Rev. Phytopathol. 1990; 28: 113-138Crossref Google Scholar). Western blot analyses of PR proteins representing these different classes showed stronger accumulation of all PR proteins in older leaves of transformants relative to control plants (Fig.6 A). A similar pattern was obtained for CPO antisense plants (data not shown). We also compared the amount of PR proteins in necrotic and non-necrotic areas of the same leaf from UROD and CPO antisense plants, respectively (Fig.6 B). In both transformants PR proteins mainly accumulated in the leaf area with necrotic lesions and were found only to a minor extent in the area devoid of lesions. Leaf lesion formation in tobacco infected with TMV is accompanied by increased levels of SA (25Enyedi A.J. Yalpani N. Silverman P. Raskin I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

https://openalex.org/W1974212990,"During HIV reverse transcription, (+) strand DNA synthesis is primed by an RNase H-resistant sequence, the polypurine tract, and continues as far as a 18-nt double-stranded RNA region corresponding to the 3′ end of tRNA<sup>Lys,3</sup> hybridized to the viral primer binding site (PBS). Before (+) strand DNA transfer, reverse transcriptase (RT) needs to unwind the double-stranded tRNA-PBS RNA in order to reverse-transcribe the 3′ end of primer tRNA<sup>Lys,3</sup>. Since the detailed mechanism of (+) strand DNA transfer remains incompletely understood, we developed an <i>in vitro</i> system to closely examine this mechanism, composed of HIV 5′ RNA, natural modified tRNA<sup>Lys,3</sup>, synthetic unmodified tRNA<sup>Lys,3</sup> or oligonucleotides (RNA or DNA) complementary to the PBS, as well as the viral proteins RT and nucleocapsid protein (NCp7). Prior to (+) strand DNA transfer, RT stalls at the double-stranded tRNA-PBS RNA complex and is able to reverse-transcribe modified nucleosides of natural tRNA<sup>Lys,3</sup>. Modified nucleoside m<sup>1</sup>A-58 of natural tRNA<sup>Lys,3</sup> is only partially effective as a stop signal, as RT can transcribe as far as the hyper-modified adenosine (ms<sup>2</sup>t<sup>6</sup>A-37) in the anticodon loop. m<sup>1</sup>A-58 is almost always transcribed into A, whereas other modified nucleosides are transcribed correctly, except for m<sup>7</sup>G-46, which is sometimes transcribed into T. In contrast, synthetic tRNA<sup>Lys,3</sup>, an RNA PBS primer, and a DNA PBS primer are completely reverse-transcribed. In the presence of an acceptor template, (+) strand DNA transfer is efficient only with templates containing natural tRNA<sup>Lys,3</sup> or the RNA PBS primer. Sequence analysis of transfer products revealed frequent errors at the transfer site with synthetic tRNA<sup>Lys,3</sup>, not observed with natural tRNA<sup>Lys,3</sup>. Thus, modified nucleoside m<sup>1</sup>A-58, present in all retroviral tRNA primers, appears to be important for both efficacy and fidelity of (+) strand DNA transfer. We show that other factors such as the nature of the (−) PBS of the acceptor template and the RNase H activity of RT also influence the efficacy of (+) strand DNA transfer."
https://openalex.org/W2064852156,"Cell surface activation of progelatinase A occurs in a quaternary complex with the tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases-2 (TIMP-2) and two membrane-type matrix metalloproteinases. We have mutated the unique cationic clusters found in hemopexin modules III and IV of the carboxyl domain (C domain) of human gelatinase A to determine their role in binding TIMP-2. Twelve single, double, and triple site-directed mutations were produced that exhibited different TIMP-2 binding properties. Notably, single alanine substitutions at Lys547 and Lys617reduced TIMP-2 binding by an order of magnitude from that of the recombinant wild-type C domain. Mutations that completely disrupted the C domain·TIMP-2 interaction were K558A/R561A, K610T/K617A, and K566A/K568A/K617A. A triple mutation, K566A/K568A/K575A, having TIMP-2 binding indistinguishable from the wild-type C domain (K d 3.0 × 10−8m), showed that simple reduction of net positive charge does not reduce TIMP-2 affinity. Because the double mutation K566A/K568A also did not alter TIMP-2 binding, these data do not confirm previously reported chimera studies that indicated the importance of the triple lysine cluster at positions 566/567/568 in TIMP-2 binding. Nonetheless, a subtle role in TIMP-2 interaction for the 566/567/568-lysine triad is indicated from the enhanced reduction in TIMP-2 binding that occurs when mutations here were combined with K617A. Thus, these analyses indicate that the TIMP-2 binding surface lies at the junction of hemopexin modules III and IV on the peripheral rim of the gelatinase A C domain. This location implies that considerable molecular movement of the TIMP-2·C domain complex would be needed for the bound TIMP-2 to inhibit in cis the gelatinase A active site.

The domain binding interactions of these proteins and their roles in the activation complex are not yet fully resolved. However, deletions and use of isolated domains have shown that TIMP-2 binds progelatinase A via the C domain of both the enzyme (14Bigg H.F. Shi Y.E. Liu Y.E. Steffensen B. Overall C.M. J. Biol.

Nonetheless, the localization of the respective contact surfaces on these two protein domains and the important molecular determinants of the binding sites have yet to be identified. In this regard, Willenbrock et al. (26Willenbrock F. Crabbe T. Slocombe P.M. Sutton C.W. Docherty A.J.P. Cockett M.I. O'Shea M. Brocklehurst K. Phillips I.R. Murphy G.

Of note, TIMP-4 also contains a similar sequence (187KEFVDIVQP195) (28Greene J. Wang M. Liu Y.E. Raymond LA. Rosen C. Shi Y.E. J. Biol.

Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15496-15500Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Thus, these carboxyl-terminal tails may be crucial in forming the gelatinase A binding site on these TIMPs. In addition, an alternate interaction of the gelatinase A C domain with αvβ3 integrin has been described (5Brooks P.C. Stromblad S. Sanders L.C. vonSchalscha T.L. Aimes R.T. Stetler-Stevenson W.G.

Chem. 1995; 270: 13453-13459Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar) have been ascribed to the C domain of the inhibitor. These may be masked upon binding the gelatinase A C domain. Thus, locating the TIMP-2 binding site on the gelatinase A C domain and generating mutations that disrupt this interaction will be invaluable in dissecting the mechanistic aspects and relative importance of the different cell membrane binding and activation mechanisms proposed for progelatinase A. These mutant proteins will also be useful in assessing the consequences of TIMP-2 binding to the gelatinase A C domain on the growth factor properties ascribed to TIMP-2.The overall shape of the gelatinase A C domain is a squat cylinder composed of four β-sheets, each representing a hemopexin module (I–IV) and each forming a blade of the four bladed β-propeller structure (30Libson A.M. Gittis A.G. Collier I.E. Marmer B.L. Goldberg G.I. Lattman E.E. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 938-942Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 31Gohlke U. Gomis-Rüth F.-Z. Crabbe T. Murphy G. Docherty A.J.P. Bode W. FEBS Lett. 1996; 378: 126-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Each β-sheet is formed from four antiparallel β-strands. Analysis of these three-dimensional models has revealed cationic clusters in hemopexin module III as a striking feature. These largely result from contiguous stretches of lysine residues, Lys547-Asn-Lys-Lys550 and Lys566-Lys-Lys568, located near the antiparallel β-strand turns at the rim and on the upper surface of the domain. Notably, Lys550, Lys566, and Lys567 from these sequences also contribute to three consecutive BX 7B repeats (B = basic residue, X = undefined): [Lys550–Lys558], [Lys558–Lys566], and [Lys567–Lys575]. A fourth BX 7B motif [Lys617-Lys625] is found in module IV. BX 7B motifs have been implicated in hyaluronan binding in several proteins (32Yang B. Savani R.C. Turley E.A. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 286-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). Although the gelatinase A C domain binds heparin (33Crabbe T. Ioannou C. Docherty A.J. Eur. J.

Overall, unpublished data. However, these cationic clusters and BX 7B repeats may be important in binding TIMP-2, possibly interacting through salt bridge formation (24Overall C.M. Wallon U.M. Steffensen B. DeClerck Y. Tschesche H. Abbey R.S. Edwards D. Hawkes S. Kokha R. Inhibitors of Metalloproteinases in Development and Disease. Harwood Academic Publishing, Lausanne, Switzerland1999Google Scholar). This hypothesis has been tested in the present report.In the absence of a three-dimensional structure of the TIMP-2·gelatinase A complex, we adopted a mutagenesis approach to identify the TIMP-2 binding site on the gelatinase A C domain. Rather than individually mutate all 36 basic residues in the C domain, we devised a strategy of using multiple replacements to screen more efficiently for important amino acid sites. Further, these substitutions were only made in the third and fourth hemopexin modules, which contain the unique cationic clusters not found in other MMPs—in particular gelatinase B, which binds TIMP-1 but not TIMP-2. We reasoned that multiple substitutions should also lessen the risk of missing weaker binding residues that as single mutations may have their effects masked by the overall binding energy of the TIMP-2·C domain complex. Reported here are mutations that establish an important role in TIMP-2 binding for several basic residues in the gelatinase A C domain. Analysis of the effects of these mutations and their location on the three-dimensional structure of the C domain has also enabled us to define the approximate boundary of the TIMP-2 binding site. Thus, TIMP-2 binds the upper surface of the human gelatinase A C domain, on its outer rim at the junction of hemopexin modules III and IV. This location has a number of ramifications concerning the proposed actions of the bound TIMP-2.RESULTSTo test the hypothesis that cationic residues in the gelatinase A C domain bind TIMP-2, possibly at the anionic terminal tail, multiple sequence alignment analysis was first used to devise a rational mutagenesis strategy. As shown in Fig. 2, 15 of the 26 basic residues in the C domain are grouped in hemopexin modules III and IV. Comparing the distribution of cationic residues in the C domains of gelatinases A and B, there are more nonconserved basic residues in modules III and IV than in I and II. Therefore, we predicted that the cationic sequences in hemopexin modules III and IV were more likely to be involved in binding TIMP-2. We first focused on the markedly cationic module III, which contains 10 basic residues compared with 5 in module IV, and designed mutations to disrupt the lysine-rich sequences Lys547-Asn-Lys-Lys550 and Lys566-Lys-Lys568. Three point mutations were made to assess the TIMP-2 binding properties of the individual lysines in the Lys547-Asn-Lys-Lys550 sequence. A double mutation (K566A/K568A) was also used to test the effect of charge reduction in the Lys566-Lys-Lys568 triad.Fermenter conditions for each mutant protein were optimized. Expression conditions were mutant protein-specific, but in general, oxygen-limited conditions (5% aeration) proved optimal for the expression of the recombinant gelatinase A C domain and mutants thereof. The mass (Da) measured by electrospray mass spectrometry and the Δ mass from that predicted for the wild-type C domain protein and from the mass of the first round of mutant proteins expressed is shown in TableII. These data confirmed the homogeneity of the protein preparations, that NH2-terminal methionine processing occurred in the recombinant proteins, and that the correct amino acid substitution had been translated.Table IIMolecular mass determination of wild-type and mutant gelatinase A C domain proteins by electrospray mass spectrometryProteinMassaThe masses were measured after sample injection onto a PESCIEX API 300 mass spectrometer from a C18 high pressure liquid chromatography column.Δ Mass from that predicted minus the N-terminal methioninebThe measured mass change from the predicted mass of the protein after N-terminal methionine processing.

The typical error for these mass determinations is 1 in 104 Da. Because of the close agreement between the measured masses with those predicted, this analysis was not carried out on proteins generated in mutagenesis rounds two and three.a The masses were measured after sample injection onto a PESCIEX API 300 mass spectrometer from a C18 high pressure liquid chromatography column.b The measured mass change from the predicted mass of the protein after N-terminal methionine processing.

Open table in a new tab Mutagenic Analysis of the TIMP-2 Binding Properties of the Lys547, Lys549, and Lys550ClusterA differential role in TIMP-2 binding was observed for alanine-substituted proteins at positions 547, 549, and 550 on the upper surface of hemopexin module III (TableIII). An alanine mutation at Lys547 raised the apparent K d of TIMP-2 interaction by approximately 1 order of magnitude (apparentK d 1.7 × 10−7m) and reduced the amount of TIMP-2 bound by ∼50% at saturation (Fig.3 A). Mutation of Lys549 or Lys550 to alanine did not significantly alter the apparent K d values of TIMP-2 interaction (7.8 × 10−8m (Fig.3 A) and 4.8 × 10−8m (Fig.3 B), respectively) from that of the wild-type domain (3.0 × 10−8m). TIMP-2 binding and elution from these mutant proteins on affinity chromatography columns was also no different from the wild-type C domain (not shown). Because a cooperative effect on TIMP-2 binding by residues in this cluster was possible, we then made the triple alanine mutation (K547A/K549A/K550A). However, TIMP-2 binding by the K547A/K549A/K550A protein (apparentK d, 2.6 × 10−7m) was essentially no different from that of the K547A mutant (Fig.3 A). This indicated that cooperative binding by these three residues does not occur and that of these residues, Lys547plays the most important binding role.Table IIITIMP-2 binding constants for gelatinase A C domain mutant proteinsProteinApparentK dmWild-type C domain3.0 × 10−8K547A1.7 × 10−7K549A7.8 × 10−8K550A4.8 × 10−8K547A/K549A/K550A2.6 × 10−7K566A/K568A4.7 × 10−8K550A/K566A/K568A1.8 × 10−7K575A5.2 × 10−8K566A/K568A/K575A7.5 × 10−8K558A/R561AUndetectableK617A1.1 × 10−7K566A/K568A/K617AUndetectableaBinding of TIMP-2 to the mutant protein indicated was not detectable by the solid phase assay, as described under “Experimental Procedures.”K610T/K617AUndetectablea Binding of TIMP-2 to the mutant protein indicated was not detectable by the solid phase assay, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Open table in a new tab Figure 3Binding of wild-type and mutant C domain proteins to TIMP-2.

This triad also contributes to two BX 7B motifs: [Lys558–Lys566] and [Lys567–Lys575] (see Table I). Rather than initially mutate each of the three residues separately, we first screened for the TIMP-2 binding properties of this cluster as a whole by charge reduction using a double alanine mutation. Sites 566 and 568 were selected, as these were nearer than Lys567 to the other cationic residues in module III (see Fig. 1). The mutant K566A/K568A protein showed TIMP-2 binding properties (apparentK d 4.7 × 10−8m) (Fig. 3 C) that were essentially identical to those of the wild-type C domain. Moreover, an affinity purified antibody raised against a peptide (NH2-RYNEVKKKMDPG-COOH) encompassing the lysine triad did not interfere with TIMP-2 binding to the wild-type C domain immobilized on a Zn2+-chelate affinity column (Fig.4 A). Finally, chromatography of TIMP-2 over a K566A/K568A protein affinity column revealed strong TIMP-2 binding to the mutant domain. Like the wild-type C domain (Fig.4 A), this interaction was not disrupted by 1.0 mNaCl or 10% Me2SO—the bound TIMP-2 and K566A/K568A mutant domain complex were eluted in 50 mm EDTA (not shown). We have previously shown that fibronectin and heparin binding by the gelatinase A C domain is Ca2+ ion-dependent, being disrupted by divalent cation chelators (34Wallon U.M. Overall C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7473-7481Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). In microwell plate assays, the C domain was not dissociated from TIMP-2 by 50 mm EDTA (not shown). This indicates that the EDTA elution of C domain with TIMP-2 from the affinity columns was primarily due to chelation and removal of the ligating Zn2+ ion from the metal chelate resin. Thus, the C domain and TIMP-2 in the 50 mm EDTA eluates represent the bound complex. Because the K566A/K568A double mutation did not alter TIMP-2 binding, these two residues were not individually substituted nor was Lys567mutated.Figure 4Elution profiles of TIMP-2 chromatographed over wild-type and mutant C domain protein affinity columns.

Therefore, to determine the effects of simultaneous mutations in these two sequences, we made the triple mutation K550A/K566A/K568A. In addition, this selection would also disrupt both the [Lys550–Lys558] and [Lys558–Lys566] BX 7B repeats (Table I). In this regard, Lys550, rather than Lys558, was also the more rational selection because Lys558 is on the underside of the domain. We considered this surface a less likely TIMP-2–binding region candidate given that 7 of the 10 basic residues in hemopexin module III are on the upper surface. As already discussed, the K550A and K566A/K568A mutations alone showed little alteration in apparent K d values for TIMP-2 compared with the wild-type C domain. However, as a triple mutation (K550A/K566A/K568A), a reduction in binding by approximately 1 order of magnitude resulted (apparent K d, 1.8 ×"

We found that the M. tuberculosis superoxide dismutase gene, encoding a leaderless polypeptide of M r ∼23,000 representing one of the four identical subunits of the enzyme, is expressed constitutively under normal growth conditions and at a 5-fold increased level under conditions of hydrogen peroxide stress. The highly pathogenic mycobacterium M. tuberculosis expresses 93-fold more superoxide dismutase than the nonpathogenic mycobacterium M. smegmatis, and it exports a much higher proportion of expressed enzyme (76 versus 21%); taking both expression and export into consideration, M. tuberculosis exports ∼350-fold more enzyme than M. smegmatis. In M. smegmatis, recombinant M. tuberculosis superoxide dismutase is expressed at 8.4 times the level of the endogenous enzyme and the proportion exported (66%) approaches that in the homologous host; hence M. smegmatis exports up to 26-fold more of the recombinant than endogenous enzyme. Interestingly, subunits of theM. tuberculosis and M. smegmatis enzymes readily and stoichiometrically exchange with each other, forming five different complexes of four subunits, both when the enzymes are expressed in the recombinant host and when the purified enzymes are incubated together; however, each subunit retains its characteristic metal ion, iron for M. tuberculosis and manganese forM. smegmatis. Compared with the cell-associated enzyme, the supernatant enzyme of recombinant M. smegmatis is enriched for M. tuberculosis enzyme subunits, consistent with preferential export of the M. tuberculosis enzyme. Recombinant M. tuberculosis superoxide dismutase transcomplements a superoxide dismutase-deficient Escherichia coli, resulting in a reduction of sensitivity of the strain to oxidative stress, but the enzyme is not exported from this nonmycobacterial host.

Our findings indicate that the information for export of the M. tuberculosis superoxide dismutase is contained within the protein but that export additionally requires export machinery specific to mycobacteria. Mycobacterium tuberculosis secretes or otherwise releases a large number of proteins into its extracellular milieu. Approximately 11 such proteins are released into broth cultures in sufficient abundance so as to merit designation as major extracellular proteins. In all cases examined thus far, these major extracellular proteins are also released into the phagosome of M. tuberculosis in human mononuclear phagocytes. The functions of several of these proteins are known, including glutamine synthetase (subunit molecular mass 58 kDa), mycolyl transferase (30/32-kDa complex), and iron-specific superoxide dismutase (subunit molecular mass 23 kDa). Extracellular proteins of M. tuberculosis are of great interest because of the likelihood that these proteins play critical roles in host-pathogen interaction, because these proteins are leading candidates for incorporation into subunit vaccines, and because these proteins are prime targets for the development of new antimycobacterial drugs (1Harth G.

Most of the extracellular proteins have leader sequences, and their export presumably occurs after processing of the leader peptide by a leader peptide-specific peptidase. However, two proteins, glutamine synthetase and superoxide dismutase, do not have leader sequences. The mechanism by which these proteins or their subunits are exported is unknown. In previous studies, we have examined the extracellular release ofM. tuberculosis glutamine synthetase. These studies demonstrated that glutamine synthetase is abundantly exported by pathogenic mycobacteria, including M. tuberculosis,Mycobacterium bovis, and Mycobacterium avium but not by nonpathogenic mycobacteria, includingMycobacterium smegmatis and Mycobacterium phlei. The studies also demonstrated that the information for export was contained within the protein since recombinant M. tuberculosis glutamine synthetase expressed in M. smegmatis was abundantly (>250 μg of protein per liter ofM. smegmatis culture and amounting to >90% of all glutamine synthetase molecules synthesized) exported, whereas the endogenous M. smegmatis enzyme was located intracellularly (>95% of all enzyme molecules synthesized) (1Harth G.

Chem. 1997; 272: 22728-22735Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). These findings with respect to the export of glutamine synthetase prompted us to investigate the other leaderless major extracellular protein of M. tuberculosis, superoxide dismutase. In particular, we wished to determine if its pattern of export followed the same paradigm as glutamine synthetase. A previous report in the literature that recombinant M. tuberculosis superoxide dismutase is not exported in M. smegmatis suggested that superoxide dismutase follows a different paradigm (6Zhang Y. Lathigra R. Garbe T. Catty D. Young D. Mol. Microbiol. 1991; 5: 381-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Superoxide dismutase (EC 1.15.1.1) catalyzes the dismutation of the superoxide anion. The enzyme is believed to be an integral part of the cell's defense against toxic oxygen metabolites. Phagocytic cells, including mononuclear phagocytes, the host cells of M. tuberculosis, generate these toxic oxygen metabolites as part of their effort to fend off pathogenic invaders (7Miller R.A. Britigan B.E. Clin. Microbiol. Rev. 1997; 10: 1-18Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Superoxide dismutase has been characterized at the DNA and protein level in several mycobacterial species in addition to M. tuberculosis. All of these enzymes are members of a family of homologous superoxide dismutases with similar biochemical properties and tertiary structure, combining either two or four subunits to form the active enzyme and coordinating either iron or manganese ions at the catalytic site (4Bunting K. Cooper J.B. Badasso M.O. Tickle I.J. Newton M. Wood S.P. Zhang Y. Young D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 251: 795-803Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 8Mayer B.K. Falkinham J.O. Infect.

A feature of the M. tuberculosis superoxide dismutase that distinguishes it from the other mycobacterial enzymes studied is that it binds iron as its metal ion ligand instead of manganese (4Bunting K. Cooper J.B. Badasso M.O. Tickle I.J. Newton M. Wood S.P. Zhang Y. Young D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 251: 795-803Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). This study presents our findings on the expression and extracellular release of endogenous and recombinant superoxide dismutases fromM. tuberculosis and M. smegmatis. The experiments were designed to answer the following fundamental questions concerning the expression and secretion of this enzyme in mycobacterial species. (i) To what extent is superoxide dismutase exported in these two species? (ii) Is recombinant M. tuberculosis superoxide dismutase expressed and secreted in M. smegmatis? (iii) Is recombinant M. tuberculosis superoxide dismutase capable of transcomplementing a completely superoxide dismutase-devoidEscherichia coli mutant, a species that, when superoxide dismutase-proficient, expresses the enzyme strictly intracellularly? (iv) Most importantly, does the export of superoxide dismutase and glutamine synthetase follow a similar or dissimilar paradigm? M. tuberculosis strain Erdman (ATCC 35801) andM. smegmatis 1-2c (provided by Peadar O'Gaora, Imperial College School of Medicine at St. Mary's, London, UK (10Garbe T.R. Barathi J. Barnini S. Zhang Y. Abou-Zeid C. Tang D. Mukherjee R. Young D.B. Microbiology. 1994; 140: 133-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar)) were grown in 7H9 medium (Difco) or Sauton's medium (11Eidus L. Hamilton E.J. Am. Rev. Resp. Dis. 1964; 90: 258-260PubMed Google Scholar) at pH 6.7. M. tuberculosis cultures were maintained in stationary flasks at 37 °C and a mixture of 5% CO2, 95% air, growing logarithmically for approximately 3 weeks, whereas M. smegmatis cultures were maintained in an environmental shaker at 180 rpm for 3–4 days or in unshaken flasks for 6–8 days at 37 °C and a mixture of 5% CO2, 95% air. M. smegmatistransformants were initially grown in 7H9 medium supplemented with 2% glucose before being transferred to standard medium containing hygromycin at 50 μg/ml. E. coli DH5α (12Hanahan D. J. Mol. Biol. 1983; 166: 557-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (8216) Google Scholar) was grown in Luria-Bertani (LB) medium, and transformants were grown under the appropriate selective conditions. The superoxide dismutase-relevant E. colistrains QC771, QC772, QC773, and QC774, specifying the parent strain, single superoxide dismutase mutants, and the sodA sodBdouble mutant (provided by Danièle Touati, Institut Jaques Monod, Université Paris, Paris, France (13Carlioz A. Touati D. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 623-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (612) Google Scholar)), respectively, were cultured in selective medium as recommended (13Carlioz A. Touati D. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 623-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (612) Google Scholar). For the analysis of physiologic parameters, these strains and the QC774 double mutant transcomplemented with the M. tuberculosis superoxide dismutase were grown under various culture conditions that are specified in the corresponding figure legends. High molecular weight genomic DNA of M. tuberculosisErdman was isolated by hot phenol extraction and used as a template in 40 rounds of amplification at 94-55-72 °C of a region containing the published DNA sequence of the structural gene for superoxide dismutase from M. tuberculosis H37Rv (6Zhang Y. Lathigra R. Garbe T. Catty D. Young D. Mol. Microbiol. 1991; 5: 381-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). The amplification product with the 5′ and 3′ primers at its respective ends (5′ primer, 5′ → 3′ GTGGCCGAATACACCTTGCCAGAC, specifying the first 8 amino acids of superoxide dismutase including the initiator methionine GTG; 3′ primer, 5′ → 3′ TCAGCCGAATATCAACCCCTTGGT, specifying the last 7 amino acids of the enzyme plus the stop codon) was cloned into pCRTM(Invitrogen) and used as a probe for Southern analyses with M. tuberculosis genomic DNA digested with various restriction enzymes. Southern hybridizations were performed on nitrocellulose membranes at 60–65 °C for 24 h in 5× SSC (1× SSC is 150 mm sodium chloride and 15 mm sodium citrate, pH 7.2) or 5× SSPE (1× SSPE is 150 mm sodium chloride, 10 mm sodium phosphate, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.2) with probes labeled to specific activities of 5 × 107 to 1 × 108 of 32P cpm/μg. Filters were washed at hybridization temperature with 0.2× SSC or SSPE, dried, and autoradiographed on Kodak X-Omat XAR5 or Fuji RX film for various times either at room temperature or at −70 °C using a Cronex Lightning-Plus intensifying screen (DuPont). BamHI restriction fragments of ∼6–10 kilobase pairs (kb), 1The abbreviations used are: kb, kilobase pair(s); bp, base pair(s); TEMED, N,N,N′,N′-tetramethylenediamine; CAPS, 3-[cyclohexylamino]-1-propanesulfonic acid. containing the hybridizing genomic DNA fragment of ∼8 kb, were cut from an agarose gel, eluted by centrifugation through siliconized glass wool, ethanol-precipitated, verified by Southern hybridization to contain the superoxide dismutase-encoding fragment, and digested with various restriction enzymes other than BamHI to produce smaller fragments for rapid directional cloning in the E. coli/mycobacteria shuttle plasmids pSMT3 (10Garbe T.R. Barathi J. Barnini S. Zhang Y. Abou-Zeid C. Tang D. Mukherjee R. Young D.B. Microbiology. 1994; 140: 133-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar) or pNBV-1 (14Howard N.S. Gomez J.E. Ko C. Bishai W.R. Gene (Amst.). 1995; 166: 181-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Restriction fragments of ∼4 kb generated with the enzymes BamHI and ClaI yielded unambiguous patterns in Southern and colony hybridizations performed as described above as well as in restriction site mapping analyses that verified that the isolated restriction fragment was identical to the published DNA sequence of the canonical shuttle cosmid T264 encompassing the sodA locus (15Philipp W.J. Poulet S. Eiglmeier K. Pascopella L. Balasubramanian V. Heym B. Bergh S. Bloom B.R. Jacobs Jr., W.R. Cole S.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 3132-3137Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). Based on this sequence and using the same reaction conditions as described above, we employed two pairs of primers (5′ primer 1 (primer 1 in Fig.1): 5′ → 3′ CAGT (arbitrary nucleotides) -ATCGAT (ClaI site) -GCTTAGTTGGTGAGATTGCGAAAG, annealing from 541 to 518 nucleotides upstream of the superoxide dismutase gene's initiator GTG codon, and 3′ primer 1 (primer 2 in Fig. 1): 5′ → 3′ CAGT (arbitrary nucleotides) -GGATCC (BamHI site) -GTAGCTCGAGTAACCAAGCATGCG, annealing to nucleotides 156 to 133 downstream of the gene's TGA stop codon; and a second pair, 5′ primer 2 and 3′ primer 2, with exactly the same sequences except that the restriction sites were switched) to amplify two fragments of ∼1.3 kb that were restricted with ClaI and BamHI and cloned directly into pNBV-1 restricted with the same enzymes. Both plasmid inserts were completely sequenced by the chain termination method (16Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52769) Google Scholar), and their sequence was identical to the publishedsodA locus on cosmid T264 (15Philipp W.J. Poulet S. Eiglmeier K. Pascopella L. Balasubramanian V. Heym B. Bergh S. Bloom B.R. Jacobs Jr., W.R. Cole S.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 3132-3137Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). The M. smegmatis 1-2c superoxide dismutase gene sequence was established for an amplification product whose primers were derived from M. tuberculosis and Mycobacterium fortuitumsuperoxide dismutase gene sequences. Two amplification products were combined to yield the entire coding region. A first pair of primers (M. smegmatis 5′ primer 1, 5′ → 3′ GTGGCCGAATACACCTTGCCAGACCTG, corresponding to the first 8 amino acids of the M. tuberculosis superoxide dismutase gene, andM. smegmatis 3′ primer 1, 5′ → 3′ CACATCGGCCCAGTTCACGACGTTCCAAAA, corresponding to codons 190 to 183 in the M. tuberculosis enzyme) yielded an amplification product of ∼570 bp. A second set of primers (M. smegmatis 5′ primer 2, 5′ → 3′ GACCAGTTCGGCTCGTTCGACAAGTTC, corresponding to codons 101–109 of the M. smegmatis enzyme, and M. smegmatis 3′ primer 2, 5′ → 3′ CTAGCCGAAGATCAGGCCGTTGGT, corresponding to the last 7 codons plus stop codon of the M. fortuitum enzyme), yielded an amplification product of ∼325 bp. Both amplification products were sequenced completely, combined, and cloned into pCRTM. The constructs used to express recombinant M. tuberculosis superoxide dismutase in M. smegmatis were based on the aforementioned amplification products of a stretch of ∼1.3 kb of M. tuberculosis DNA spanning the superoxide dismutase coding region plus 5′- and 3′-flanking sequences. One construct contained the amplification product inserted into theClaI-BamHI sites of the multi-cloning region of pNBV-1 in a 5′ → 3′ direction, thereby allowing transcription of the superoxide dismutase gene to proceed in a direction opposite the direction of transcription of the vector encoded β-galactosidase promoter; the second construct was inserted in the same restriction sites but in opposite orientation, thus aligning the superoxide dismutase and β-galactosidase promoters. Constructs were first established in E. coli DH5α and then electroporated intoM. smegmatis 1-2c as described (10Garbe T.R. Barathi J. Barnini S. Zhang Y. Abou-Zeid C. Tang D. Mukherjee R. Young D.B. Microbiology. 1994; 140: 133-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Stable M. smegmatis 1-2c transformants were selected and characterized for expression of superoxide dismutase as described below. For transcomplementation of the E. coli sodA sodBdouble mutant QC774, an amplification product of the M. tuberculosis superoxide dismutase gene was ligated in theNcoI-HindIII sites of the high level expression vector pKK233-2 (provided by Andrew Campbell, Brown University, Providence, RI (17Amann E. Brosius J. Gene (Amst.). 1985; 40: 183-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar)). The amplification reaction was performed under standard conditions (see above) with the cloned M. tuberculosis superoxide dismutase gene as a template and the following primer pair: 5′ primer (primer 3 in Fig. 1), 5′ → 3′ GATC (arbitrary nucleotides) -CCATGG- (NcoI site, the internal ATG provides the initiator methionine, the second G is part of the alanine codon, the first amino acid of the mature protein) -CCGAATACACCTTGCCAGACCTGGACTGGGAC (corresponding to codons 1–11) and 3′ primer (primer 4 in Fig. 1), 5′ → 3′ CTAG (arbitrary nucleotides) -AAGCTT (HindIII site) -TCAGCCGAATATCAACCCCTTGGTCTGCGA (corresponding to the last 9 codons plus stop codon). The amplification product was first cloned into pCRTM, verified by DNA sequencing, recloned into pKK233-2 as anNcoI-HindIII fragment, maintained in DH5α, and transformed into QC774 under the appropriate selection conditions (13Carlioz A. Touati D. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 623-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (612) Google Scholar). Characterization of endogenous and recombinant superoxide dismutases was performed by the following analytical methods. M. tuberculosis, M. smegmatis, and E. coli were cultured in standard medium as described above. Aliquots of the cultures were removed and separated into cell pellets and supernatants by centrifugation. Cell pellets were taken up in a small volume of 1× phosphate-buffered saline (50 mmsodium phosphate and 150 mm sodium chloride, pH 7.2) and lysed either by vortexing vigorously with 60-mesh crystalline alumina beads (Fisher) for 5 min at room temperature (mycobacterial species) or by the addition of lysozyme at 100 μg/ml for 20 min on ice (E. coli). Insoluble material was collected by centrifugation, and the cell pellet proteins were dialyzed extensively against 1× phosphate-buffered saline, centrifuged again, and adjusted to a final volume containing the proteins of 1 × 108 lysed cells per μl. The culture supernatants were concentrated in an Amicon diaflo unit using membranes with a molecular weight cut-off of 3,000, dialyzed extensively against 1× phosphate-buffered saline, centrifuged, and adjusted to a final volume such that 1 μl contained the supernatant proteins of 1 × 108 cells of the original culture. Proteins in the cell pellets and culture supernatants were analyzed by electrophoresis on standard, 10% denaturing polyacrylamide gels, followed by staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. Protein concentrations in the cell pellets and culture supernatants were determined by the bicinchoninic acid reagent (Pierce). Polyvalent antibodies against the purified M. tuberculosis superoxide dismutase were raised as follows. The enzyme was purified from culture supernatants of 3-week-old M. tuberculosis Erdman cultures by ammonium sulfate precipitation and chromatography on DEAE-CL6B and Superdex 75 to yield a homogeneous enzyme preparation as judged by denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. The superoxide dismutase band (subunit, 23 kDa) was excised and eluted from the gel. Rabbits were immunized with an emulsion of purified superoxide dismutase and Syntex adjuvant formulation (18Allison A.C. Byars N.E. J. Immunol. Methods. 1986; 95: 157-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar) containing 100 μg of purified enzyme and 1.5 μg ofN-acetylmuramyl-l-alanyl-d-isoglutamine, followed by three booster immunizations at 12-day intervals with 100 μg of enzyme. Antibody preparations had reciprocal titers of <100 pre-immunization and ∼105 post-immunization against the native and denatured enzyme isolated from M. tuberculosisErdman cell pellets and culture supernatants. In Western blots, superoxide dismutase was the only protein of all cellular and extracellular M. tuberculosis Erdman proteins that reacted with the antibodies. For the detection and identification of endogenous and recombinant superoxide dismutases, proteins in cell pellets and culture supernatants were electrophoresed in 10% denaturing polyacrylamide gels, transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, and incubated first with pre- and post-immune rabbit anti-M. tuberculosis superoxide dismutase antibodies at dilutions of 1:100 and 1:5,000, respectively, and then with alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibodies. The immunoblots were stained with alkaline phosphatase-specific color development reagents (Bio-Rad) and then scanned in an Eagle Eye IITM unit (Stratagene) to quantify expression of the various superoxide dismutases. Calibration of the Western blots for the densitometric evaluation of the immunoreactivity of the polyvalent antibodies, described above, and their cognate antigen, iron- and manganese-specific superoxide dismutases, was performed with superoxide dismutase purified from supernatants ofM. tuberculosis Erdman cultures. Cell pellets and culture supernatants were first dialyzed against low ionic strength phosphate buffer and separated from low molecular mass components (<30 kDa) by centrifugation in centricon units (Amicon) containing a membrane with a 30-kDa cut-off and subsequently electrophoresed on duplicate 10% denaturing polyacrylamide gels and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes in 10 mm CAPS and 10% methanol, pH 11. One blot was used to identify bands containing superoxide dismutase by staining with antibodies. Corresponding bands on the duplicate blot were then subjected to N-terminal amino acid sequence analysis at the UCLA protein microsequencing facility using a Porton 2090 E amino acid sequencer. The 5-band complex of the active recombinant M. tuberculosissuperoxide dismutase enzyme was transferred from native polyacrylamide gels to nitrocellulose membranes. The top, middle, and bottom bands were excised from the membranes, solubilized in a small volume of dimethyl sulfoxide, and finally brought up in 1 ml of water that had been Chelex-treated to eliminate traces of metal ions in the distilled water. Manganese and iron atoms were measured by flame atomic absorption spectrometry. All bacterial cell pellets and culture supernatants were electrophoresed on 15% non-denaturing polyacrylamide gels with constant voltage of 100 V per gel at room temperature and assessed quantitatively and qualitatively for enzymatic activity by staining as described (19Beauchamp C. Fridovich I. Anal. Biochem. 1971; 44: 276-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (10014) Google Scholar). The gels were incubated for 30 min in 2.5 mm nitro blue tetrazolium, followed by incubation for 20 min in 30 mm potassium phosphate, 30 mm TEMED, and 30 μm riboflavin, pH 7.8, and visualization of the superoxide dismutase activity bands by illuminating the gels for 10 min on a lightbox. Areas of superoxide dismutase activity were visible as white bands against a blue background. Quantitation of superoxide dismutase activity was standardized by scanning activity gels using the two commercially available E. coli enzymes, iron superoxide dismutase and manganese superoxide dismutase. Enzyme units were first defined by the nitro blue tetrazolium reduction assay (19Beauchamp C. Fridovich I. Anal. Biochem. 1971; 44: 276-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (10014) Google Scholar) and then correlated to the observed intensities of the white bands in the activity gels. Furthermore, since we had established growth curves of all described bacterial strains by determining colony-forming units at various time points during their respective incubation periods, we were able to correlate any densitometrically determined enzyme activity to the number of bacteria needed to produce that signal. For an assessment of the paraquat (methyl viologen, 1,1′-dimethyl-4,4′-dipyridinium) sensitivity of QC774 and its transformants, broth cultures were inoculated with 1 × 106 cells per ml and grown in the presence of various paraquat concentrations for 6–72 h. Colony-forming units were enumerated at various time points during the growth phase of the cultures by plating aliquots of the cultures on selective media. For comparison, the parent strain QC771 was analyzed in the same fashion. Hydrogen peroxide sensitivity of QC774 and its transformants was determined by growing broth cultures in LB medium to a cell density of 1 × 108 cells per ml and then treating the cultures with 2.5 or 5 mm hydrogen peroxide for 30 or 60 min. Aliquots of the cultures were removed at the end of the treatment period, plated, and enumerated for colony-forming units after 24 h at 37 °C. For comparison, the parent strain QC771 was also assessed for its hydrogen peroxide sensitivity under the same culture conditions. All chemicals and enzymes were purchased from Sigma unless indicated otherwise and were of the highest grade available. All oligonucleotides were purchased from Genosys Biotechnologies, Inc. We first established a base line for the expression of the endogenous superoxide dismutases from both mycobacterial species by assessing cell pellets and culture supernatants of unshaken M. tuberculosis cultures and both shaken and unshaken M. smegmatis cultures for enzyme activity. The results clearly showed that in all cultures enzyme activity increased in parallel with cell density, and the protein patterns did not change significantly during the observation period, suggesting that there are few if any truly early or late released proteins. The only measurable difference was that M. smegmatis cultures in unshaken flasks grew with approximately 50% the growth rate of the shaken cultures. This result further indicated that the proteins in the culture supernatants were stable. This supposition was later confirmed by immunoblot analyses of cell pellets and culture supernatants, which showed no detectable degradation products of the superoxide dismutases. In view of these results, we selected the following time points for assessing the various cultures for the amount, distribution, and activity of expressed superoxide dismutase: 3 weeks for M. tuberculosiscultures and 3 days for M. smegmatis shaken cultures. The two mycobacterial species differed dramatically in their superoxide dismutase expression patterns with regard to both the level of expression and distribution of the enzyme. In an analysis in which superoxide dismutase expression was quantified by densitometrically scanning immunoblots (Fig. 2, middle portion), M. tuberculosis expressed a total (cell pellet + supernatant) of 2.8 fg per cell versus"

We studied the role of Lys39 of alanine racemase (EC 5.1.1.1) from Bacillus stearothermophilus, the PLP-binding residue of the enzyme, by replacing it site-specifically with alanine and characterizing the resultant K39A mutant enzyme. The mutant enzyme turned out to be inherently inactive, but gained an activity as high as about 0.1% of that of the wild-type enzyme upon addition of 0.2m methylamine. The amine-assisted activity of the mutant enzyme depended on the pK a values and molecular volumes of the alkylamines used. A strong kinetic isotope effect was observed when α-deuterated d-alanine was used as a substrate in the methylamine-assisted reaction, but little effect was observed using its antipode. In marked contrast, onlyl-enantiomer of alanine showed a solvent isotope effect in deuterium oxide in the methylamine-assisted reaction. These results suggest that methylamine serves as a base not only to abstract the α-hydrogen from d-alanine but also to transfer a proton from water to the α-position of the deprotonated (achiral) intermediate to form d-alanine. Therefore, the exogenous amine can be regarded as a functional group fully representing Lys39 of the wild-type enzyme. Lys39 of the wild-type enzyme probably acts as the base catalyst specific to thed-enantiomer of alanine.

The generally accepted mechanism of alanine racemase reaction proceeds through the steps shown in SchemeFSI. PLP bound with the active-site lysyl residue (A) reacts with a substrate to form an external Schiff base (B) through transaldimination. The subsequent α-hydrogen abstraction results in the formation of a resonance-stable deprotonated intermediate (C). If reprotonation occurs at the α-carbon of the substrate moiety on the opposite face of the planar intermediate (C), then an antipodal aldimine (D) is formed. The ε-amino group of the lysine residue is substituted for the isomerized amino acid through transaldimination, and the internal aldimine (E) is regenerated. Recent kinetic analyses (1Sawada S. Tanaka Y. Hayashi S. Ryu M. Hasegawa T. Yamamoto Y. Esaki N. Soda K. Takahashi S. Biosci. Biotech.

Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 10438-10443Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) have suggested that the alanine racemase reaction proceeds through a two-base mechanism; proton donors and proton acceptors are situated on both sides of the planar intermediate (C) in order to accomplish removal and return of the α-hydrogen of the substrate amino acid. The lysyl residue forming a Schiff base with PLP is shown to act as the base to abstract α-hydrogen from a substrate amino acid in many PLP enzymes. The lysyl residue binding PLP in alanine racemase is also believed to play this role (2Shaw J.P. Petsko G.P. Ringe D.

However, the PLP-binding lysyl residue has another important function as a catalyst for transaldimination with a substrate amino acid. Therefore, one may expect complicated results by site-directed mutagenesis of the lysyl residue. However, Toney and Kirsch (4Toney M.D. Kirsch J.F. Science. 1989; 243: 1485-1488Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar) have developed an elegant method named chemical rescue by which the function of a lysine residue lost by mutagenesis can be rationally compensated by means of various kinds of amines. We have studied the role of lysine 39, the PLP-binding lysyl residue of alanine racemase from Bacillus stearothermophilus(BSAR) (5Inagaki K. Tanizawa K. Badet B. Walsh C.T. Tanaka H. Soda K.

We here show that Lys39 of BSAR probably serves as the base abstracting α-hydrogen specifically from the d-enantiomer of alanine. The K39A BSAR was constructed and purified to homogeneity as described previously (8Kurokawa Y. Watanabe A. Yoshimura T. Esaki N. Soda K. J. Biochem.

Kondo of Unitika Ltd., Osaka, Japan; l-lactate dehydrogenase was from Boehringer Mannheim. d-[α-2H]Alanine was prepared from a reaction mixture (1.0 ml) containing 0.1 m boric acid buffer (p2H 8.4), 89.1 mg of d-alanine, and 100 units of d-amino acid aminotransferase, whose solvent was replaced by 2H2O by repeated concentrations and dilutions with 20 mm potassium phosphate buffer in2H2O (p2H 8.4) with a Centricon 10 ultrafiltration unit. The reaction was performed at 37 °C for 16 h, and then stopped by heating at 100 °C for 10 min. After centrifugation, the supernatant solution was applied to a Dowex 50 (formate form) column (inner diameter, 2.0 × 10 cm), andd-[α-2H]alanine was eluted with 50 ml of 0.1 m HCl. The fractions containing d-alanine were pooled and evaporated to dryness. l-[α-2H]Alanine was prepared withl-methionine γ-lyase (10Esaki N. Nakayama T. Sawada S. Tanaka H. Soda K. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 3857-3862Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) in a mixture (p2H 7.5 in 1.0 ml of 2H2O) containing 89.1 mg ofl-alanine and 23.7 mg of l-methionine γ-lyase. The reaction was carried out at 28 °C for 72 h, and then l-[α-2H]alanine was isolated in the same manner as described above. The deuterium contents of d-[α-2H]alanine and l-[α-2H]alanine were both higher than 97% when determined by 1H NMR. Protein concentrations were determined by measurement of absorbance at 280 nm or by the method of Bradford (11Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216412) Google Scholar) with bovine serum albumin as a standard. The absorption coefficients at 280 nm were estimated from the molecular weight and the amino acid composition of the enzymes. Conversion of d-alanine tol-alanine catalyzed by BSAR was determined by following the formation of NADH in a coupled reaction with l-alanine dehydrogenase. The assay mixture contained 100 mm CAPS buffer whose pH was adjusted to pH 10.5 with tetramethylammonium hydroxide, 0.15 units of alanine dehydrogenase, 30 mmd-alanine, and 2.5 mm NAD+ in a final volume of 1.0 ml. The reaction was started by addition of alanine racemase (about 0.01 μg) after preincubation of the mixture at 37 °C for 15 min. An increase in absorbance at 340 nm was followed. One unit of the enzyme was defined as the amount of enzyme that catalyzed the racemization of 1 μmol of substrate/min. d-Alanine formed from l-alanine was assayed with d-amino acid aminotransferase. The assay mixture contained 100 mm CAPS buffer (adjusted to pH 10.5 with tetramethylammonium hydroxide), 30 mml-alanine, 5 mm α-ketoglutarate, 0.16 mm NADH, 12 units of d-amino acid aminotransferase, and 10 units of lactate dehydrogenase. The reaction was started by addition of alanine racemase (about 0.01 μg) after preincubation of the mixture at 37 °C for 10 min. A decrease in absorbance at 340 nm was monitored. The amine-assisted reactions were conducted with about 52 μg of K39A mutant enzyme in the presence of various concentrations (0–200 mm) of amines, whose solutions were adjusted to pH 10.5 with tetramethylammonium hydroxide. The final ionic strength of the reaction mixture was adjusted to 0.5 by addition of tetramethylammonium chloride. The apparent rate constant (k obs) of the reaction is expressed by the following equation (4Toney M.D. Kirsch J.F. Science. 1989; 243: 1485-1488Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). kobs=kB[amine]free+ksolEquation 1 k B is the rate constant of the reaction catalyzed by the deprotonated form of amine;k sol, the rate constant of the reaction proceeding independently of amine; and [amine]free, the concentration of deprotonated amine. Since [amine]freedepends on the ionization constant (K a) of the amine and proton concentration [H+] in the system, Equation 1 is converted to Equation 4 as follows. [amine]protonated=[amine]free⋅[H+]/KaEquation 2 [amine]total=[amine]free+[amine]protonated=[amine]free(1+[H+]/Ka)Equation 3 kobs=kB[amine]total/(1+[H+]/Ka)+ksolEquation 4 [amine]total is the concentration of added amine, and [amine]protonated is the concentration of the protonated form of the amine. The rate constant, k B, was obtained from the plots of k obs against [amine]total/(1 + [H+]/K a). The substrate deuterium isotope effect was determined from the rates of racemization ofd- or l-[α-2H]alanine in the presence of 100 mm methylamine. The conditions were the same as described above. The solvent deuterium isotope effect was determined with the assay mixture (0.5 ml) that contained, in 2H2O, various concentrations of d- or l-alanine, 100 mm CAPS buffer (p2H 10.9), and 100 mm methylamine. The reaction was started by addition of alanine racemase, which had been freed from H2O by repeated lyophilization and dissolution in 2H2O, and stopped by heating at 100 °C for 10 min. l-Alanine formed was determined as follows. A mixture (0.5 ml) containing 100 mm CHES buffer (pH 9.0), 5 mm NAD+, 0.15 units of alanine dehydrogenase, and an aliquot of the sample solution was incubated at 37 °C for 60 min, and then NADH formed was measured at 340 nm. d-Alanine produced was assayed in the same manner with a mixture containing 100 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.5), 0.2 mm NADH, 5 mmα-ketoglutarate, 0.24 units of d-amino acid aminotransferase, 2.8 units of lactate dehydrogenase, and an aliquot of the sample solution. The incubation was done at 37 °C for 60 min. K39A BSAR was identical with the wild-type BSAR in far-UV (180–200 nm) and near-UV (200–300 nm) CD spectra (data not shown). This suggests that K39A BSAR has a secondary structure virtually identical to that of the wild-type enzyme. K39A BSAR lacks Lys39, which inherently forms a Schiff base with PLP, but the enzyme showed an absorption maximum around 410 nm at pH 7.2, which maximum is slightly red-shifted in comparison with that of a free aldehyde form of PLP. This may have been due to the formation of a Schiff base between an unknown lysyl residue and PLP in K39A BSAR, and we examined this possibility by incubating K39A BSAR with 0.5 m NaBH4 at 25 °C for 8 h. The absorption band at 410 nm disappeared and a new band appeared at around 330 nm, indicating that the bound PLP was reduced by the treatment. However, the PLP derivative was removed completely by dialysis against 6 m guanidine hydrochloride (data not shown). This indicates that the aldehyde group of PLP stays in a free form in K39A BSAR. The mutant enzyme had no CD band due to the bound PLP, in clear contrast to the wild-type enzyme, which showed a negative CD band around 420 nm (Fig. 1). K39A BSAR was inactive, but its catalytic activities in both directions of racemization (from l- to d-alanine, and fromd- to l-alanine) were restored by addition of 0.2 m methylamine. In contrast, the wild-type BSAR was inhibited by methylamine, although only slightly. A negative CD band similar to that of the wild-type BSAR appeared around 420 nm by addition of methylamine (Fig. 1). This suggests that methylamine forms a Schiff base with the C4′ of PLP in the same manner as Lys39 of the wild-type BSAR. Shaw et al. (2Shaw J.P. Petsko G.P. Ringe D. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 1329-1342Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar) have reported that the position of PLP-binding lysine in BSAR is very similar to that in d-amino acid aminotransferase (12Sugio S. Petsko G.A. Manning J.M. Soda K. Ringe D. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 9661-9669Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar) upon superposition of their bound PLP. The two enzymes are similar, in that their CD bands at around 420 nm due to bound PLP appear as negative bands. X-ray crystallographic analysis has shown that the lysines in both enzymes approach the re face of bound PLP (2Shaw J.P. Petsko G.P. Ringe D. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 1329-1342Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar, 12Sugio S. Petsko G.A. Manning J.M. Soda K. Ringe D. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 9661-9669Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Therefore, methylamine forming a Schiff base with PLP in BSAR K39A presumably approaches the re face of PLP as well. The activities in both directions of alanine racemization catalyzed by K39A BSAR increased proportionally with increases in the concentration of methylamine added (Fig.2). We found that other alkylamines were also effective as catalysts (Figs. 3 and4), although the dialkylamines, dimethylamine, and diethylamine were ineffective (Fig. 2). However, no evidence for saturation (at free base concentrations up to 200 mm) was observed, and there appeared to be no significant binding of alkylamines by K39A BSAR under our experimental conditions. The rate of the methylamine-assisted reaction at pH 10.5 was much higher than that at pH 9.0 (Fig. 2). This indicates that only the free base of alkylamine participates in the catalysis, and we therefore calculated the rate constants of the reactions due to the free forms of amines (k B) on the basis of their dissociation constants (K a) and pH values of the reaction media, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Toney and Kirsch (4Toney M.D. Kirsch J.F. Science. 1989; 243: 1485-1488Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar) have shown that a Brønsted analysis is applicable to the proton transfer catalyzed by K258A mutant aspartate aminotransferase assisted by exogenous amines, and found a multiple linear relationship between log k B and two independent factors, the pK a and molecular volume of the amine, as follows. logkB=β(pKa)+V(molecular volume)+cEquation 5 c is the constant term. We also found that a plot of log k B versuspK a values of four kinds of amines with similar molecular volumes exhibited a linearity in both directions of alanine racemization (Fig. 3). The least squares fit of the data shown in Fig.3 gave a Brønsted β value of 0.57 (r = 0.85) for the D → L reaction and of 0.62 (r = 0.92) for the L → D reaction. Moreover, we found that the log k Bvalues were inversely proportional to the molecular volumes of a series of alkylamines with similar pK a values (Fig.4). The V values calculated from the data shown in Fig.4 were −0.037 Å3(r = 0.98) for the D → L reaction and −0.038 Å3 (r = 0.99) for the L → D reaction.Figure 3Relationship between pK a values of amines with similar molecular volumes and log k B of amine-assisted reactions from d- to l-alanine (A) and l- to d-alanine (B) catalyzed by K39A BSAR.

Walsh C.T. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 3267-3276Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) have demonstrated that the step of transaldimination is rate-limiting in the reaction catalyzed by the wild-type BSAR. Therefore, the rescue effect by alkylamines observed here may be primarily due to their action as a base (or a nucleophile) in transaldimination. This is also supported by our findings of good agreement between the two Brønsted β values of the D → L and the L → D reactions. Faraci and Walsh (13Faraci W.S. Walsh C.T. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 3267-3276Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) found that the isotope effect was virtually absent in the alanine racemization catalyzed by the wild-type BSAR. However, we examined the deuterium isotope effect in the methylamine-assisted racemization catalyzed by K39A BSAR with d- andl-[α-2H]alanine. As shown in Fig. 5, we found a significant isotope effect for the reaction fromd-alanine to l-alanine; a clear isotope effect was visualized on V rather than V/K(Fig. 5 and Table I). However, no isotope effect was observed in the L → D reaction. Therefore, the step of α-deuteron abstraction from d-alanine was kinetically important and probably at least partially rate-limiting throughout the whole process, while the removal of α-deuteron from the antipode was kinetically insignificant. In marked contrast, however, when we examined the solvent isotope effect, a strong effect was observed only for the reaction from l-alanine to d-alanine (Table I). Thus, the step of α-protonation (with deuterium) to produce d-alanine is kinetically crucial, while its counterpart for the production of l-alanine fromd-alanine is not. Presumably, the overall profile of the K39A BSAR reaction assisted by an alkylamine is fairly asymmetric, as opposed to that of the wild-type BSAR reaction depicted by Faraci and Walsh (13Faraci W.S. Walsh C.T. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 3267-3276Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar).Table IDeuterium isotope effects of the methylamine-assisted racemization ofd- and l-alanine catalyzed by the K39A mutant enzymeReactionSubstrate isotope effectSolvent isotope effectV H/V 2H(V/K)H/ (V/K)2HV H2O/V 2H2O(V/K)H2O/ (V/K)2H2Od- to l-alanine5.42.61.31.0l- tod-alanine1.11.14.01.4 Open table in a new tab Toney and Kirsch (4Toney M.D. Kirsch J.F.

Since their report, this “chemical rescue” approach has been successfully applied to a number of enzymes to identify catalytic residues and to establish structure-activity relationships. The rescuer molecules used are amines for lysine-mutated enzymes (14Sekimoto T. Matsuyama T. Fukui T. Tanizawa K. J. Biol.

In this study, we have demonstrated by combination of chemical rescue studies and isotope effect analysis of the amine-assisted reactions catalyzed by K39A BSAR that Lys39 of the wild-type BSAR probably mediates not only transaldimination but also α-hydrogen abstraction from the substrate. This is one of the rare examples of a chemical rescue study clarifying multiple functions of a catalytically important residue by combination with isotope effect analysis. The dad B and alr alanine racemases fromSalmonella typhimurium are distinct from BSAR in that the former enzymes show substrate and solvent deuterium isotope effects (13Faraci W.S. Walsh C.T. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 3267-3276Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Abstraction of α-deuteron fromd-[α-2H]alanyl-PLP aldimine and protonation (with deuteron) of the carbanion intermediate (Scheme FSI) to give thed-alanyl aldimine in 2H2O are rate-limiting (although maybe only partially) in the racemization reaction catalyzed by the Salmonella enzymes. Although the isotope-effect values vary widely among these enzymes, the amine-assisted reaction catalyzed by K39A BSAR is identical to the reactions catalyzed by the Salmonella enzymes in this respect. Sawada et al. (1Sawada S. Tanaka Y. Hayashi S. Ryu M. Hasegawa T. Yamamoto Y. Esaki N. Soda K. Takahashi S. Biosci. Biotech. Biochem. 1994; 58: 807-811Crossref Scopus (10) Google Scholar) have proposed on the basis of kinetic evidence that the reaction catalyzed by BSAR proceeds through a two-base mechanism. Shaw et al. (2Shaw J.P. Petsko G.P. Ringe D. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 1329-1342Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar) have postulated on the basis of x-ray crystallographic studies that Lys39 and Tyr265 of BSAR serve as the bases to abstract α-hydrogen from the alanyl-PLP aldimine and to protonate the carbanion intermediate to give the alanyl-PLP aldimine. After α-hydrogen is abstracted from the alanyl-PLP aldimine by one base, the other base, which lies on the opposite side of the plane of the alanyl-PLP carbanion intermediate, probably protonates the carbanion in order for racemization to occur. Tyr265 is the only possible residue whose side chain lies almost directly opposite the side chain of Lys39, and the hydroxyl group of Tyr265 is postulated to serve as the second base (2Shaw J.P. Petsko G.P. Ringe D. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 1329-1342Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). The chemical rescue studies presented here strongly suggest that Lys39 serves as the base that abstracts α-hydrogen from the d-alanyl-PLP aldimine and protonates the carbanion intermediate to produce the PLP-aldimine of the same enantiomer. Therefore, Tyr265 is assumed to be the second base specifically acting on thel-alanyl-PLP aldimine. The crystal structure of the BSAR complex with R-1-aminoethylphosphonic acid (l-Ala-P) (3Stamper C.G. Morollo A.A. Ringe D. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 10438-10443Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), a tight-binding inhibitor of BSAR (23Badet B. Inagaki K. Soda K. Walsh C.T. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 3275-3282Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), has demonstrated that the phenolic oxygen of Tyr265 is located at a position much closer than the NZ of Lys39 to the α-carbon of the l-Ala-P-PLP aldimine; the phenolic oxygen of Tyr265 is appropriately aligned for proton abstraction from an l-isomer in the active site of the clarified structure. Both Lys39 and Tyr265 are conserved in bothdad B and alr alanine racemases of S. typhimurium (24Wasserman S.A. Daub E. Grisafi P. Botstein D. Walsh C.T. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 5182-5187Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 25Galakatos N.G. Daub E. Botstein D. Walsh C.T. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 3255-3260Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), and these residues probably play the same roles, respectively, as those in BSAR. According to the kinetic isotope effect studies of Faraci and Walsh (13Faraci W.S. Walsh C.T. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 3267-3276Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), we can assume that Lys39 is less effective than Tyr265 as the base in the S. typhimurium enzymes. The only marked difference between BSAR and the S. typhimurium enzymes is that Glu314 of BSAR is replaced by a methionine in both S. typhimurium enzymes. Crystallographic studies (2Shaw J.P. Petsko G.P. Ringe D. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 1329-1342Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar) have suggested that Glu314 of BSAR plays an important role at the active site. Glu314 of BSAR is hydrogen-bonded with a water molecule, which is hydrogen-bonded to the O3′ of the PLP ring. Moreover, the side-chain OE1 of Glu314 is also hydrogen-bonded with NH1 of Arg136, which is believed to be the binding site for the carboxyl group of the substrate alanine. The lack of a glutamate at this position in the S. typhimuriumenzymes may be responsible for the apparently higher efficiency of Lys39 than Tyr265 as a base to abstract α-hydrogen from the substrate alanine. Replacement of Lys39 with alanine probably perturbed the active site structure of K39A BSAR, even in the presence of the rescuer alkylamines, and this may be the reason that the α-hydrogen-abstraction step was rate-limiting (although maybe only partially) in the amine-assisted reaction. According to the general mechanism of transaldimination, the imino nitrogen of an internal Schiff base is considered to be non-protonated and to remove a proton from the protonated form of the amino group of a substrate amino acid. Thus, the deprotonated amino group of the amino acid is allowed to attack the 4′-carbon of the internal Schiff base. The PLP-binding lysyl residue is released from the geminal diamine, and the first transaldimination is accomplished. The second transaldimination proceeds through a nucleophilic attack on the 4′-carbon of the external Schiff base by the free amino group of the lysyl residue to release a product. The PLP-binding lysyl residue is known to be crucial as the catalyst in product release, as shown by site-directed mutagenesis studies on aspartate aminotransferase (4Toney M.D. Kirsch J.F. Science. 1989; 243: 1485-1488Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar), tryptophan synthase (26Lu Z. Nagata S. McPhie P. Miles E.W. J. Biol.

(Tokyo). 1997; 121: 604-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar); the product (or substrate) forms a stable Schiff base with PLP and is not released readily from the enzyme unless the PLP-binding lysine is present. On the basis of the mechanism described above, we propose a mechanism of the amine-assisted reaction catalyzed by K39A BSAR in which three bases mediate the proton transfer by cooperation with Lys39 and Tyr265 (SchemeFSII). B1 transfers a proton from the amino nitrogen of the geminal diamine intermediate to the phenolate of Tyr265; B2 protonates and deprotonates the alkylamine moiety of the geminal diamine intermediate; B3 transfers a proton from an alkylamine to the amino acid moiety released from the geminal diamine intermediate. B1, B2, and B3 are possibly His166, Arg136, and Asp313, respectively, according to the x-ray structures of BSAR (2Shaw J.P. Petsko G.P. Ringe D. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 1329-1342Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar, 3Stamper C.G. Morollo A.A. Ringe D. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 10438-10443Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), although this hypothesis cannot be proven definitively until the x-ray structure of alanine-bound BSAR is determined. All monoalkylamines (and their derivatives) examined here showed significant rescue effects to enhance the activity of K39A BSAR, and their efficiencies depended on both molecular volume and pK a. However, dialkylamines were ineffective, and in this respect our results differ markedly from those of Kirsch and Toney (30Kirsch J.F. Toney M.D. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1990; 585: 48-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar); that is, we found that dimethylamine was also an effective rescuer for the K258A mutant of aspartate aminotransferase. This difference was probably due to a difference in the catalytic role of rescuer amines in the enzymes examined. Amines primarily serve as the base that abstracts α-hydrogen from substrate amino acid in aspartate aminotransferase. In K39A BSAR, however, transaldimination is kinetically more important than α-hydrogen abstraction as a role of amines; transaldimination is believed to be rate-determining in the wild-type BSAR reaction (13Faraci W.S. Walsh C.T. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 3267-3276Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Dialkylamines are probably less efficient than monoalkylamines as a catalyst of transaldimination for reason of steric hindrance, since amines need to bind covalently to C4′ of PLP in transaldimination. However, no covalent bond formation is required in order for amines to abstract α-hydrogen from substrate. The Brønsted β values observed for both the D → L and L → D reactions probably reflect the transition state of either of the two steps in transaldimination: either deprotonation of the protonated form of amino acid substrate by alkylamine to form PLP-aldimine or nucleophilic addition of alkylamine at C4′ of the substrate-PLP aldimine. Both of these steps depend on the pK a values of the amines used (31Fersht A. Enzyme Structure and Mechanism. W. H. Freeman and Co., New York1985Google Scholar), and we currently have no explanation for the Brønsted β values we obtained. Nonetheless, this constitutes the first report of a chemical rescue for a lysyl residue responsible for transaldimination. We are grateful to Professors Hiroyuki Kagamiyama and Hideyuki Hayashi of Osaka Medical College, Professor Ken Hirotsu of Osaka City University, and Professor Seiki Kuramitsu of Osaka University, for their helpful discussions."

In this study we investigated the identity, subcellular localization, and maturation of a putative 65-kDa gp91phox precursor (p65). Expressing the gp91phox cDNA in an in vitrotranscription and translation system, we found that synthesis of p65 required endoplasmic reticulum (ER) microsomes. Sucrose density gradient centrifugation of postnuclear supernatants obtained from a PLB-985 derived cell line with a constitutively expressed gp91phox transgene demonstrated that p65 co-sedimented with the ER marker protein calreticulin and myeloperoxidase precursors. Unexpectedly, the majority of p22phox was found in subcellular compartments containing the mature 91-kDa form of gp91phox and not with p65, suggesting that heterodimer formation may occur in a post-ER compartment. The heme synthesis inhibitor, succinyl acetone, reduced the abundance of mature gp91phox and p22phoxbut had little or no impact on p65. These studies demonstrate (a) gp91phox is synthesized as a glycosylated 65-kDa precursor in the ER, (b) heterodimer formation is not a co-translational process, and (c) heme insertion is a determinant in the formation of a stable heterodimer but does not appear to affect the stability of p65. The redox center of the phagocyte NADPH oxidase is flavocytochrome b 558, a transmembrane protein with two subunits, gp91phox and p22phox. In this study we investigated the identity, subcellular localization, and maturation of a putative 65-kDa gp91phox precursor (p65). Expressing the gp91phox cDNA in an in vitrotranscription and translation system, we found that synthesis of p65 required endoplasmic reticulum (ER) microsomes. Sucrose density gradient centrifugation of postnuclear supernatants obtained from a PLB-985 derived cell line with a constitutively expressed gp91phox transgene demonstrated that p65 co-sedimented with the ER marker protein calreticulin and myeloperoxidase precursors. Unexpectedly, the majority of p22phox was found in subcellular compartments containing the mature 91-kDa form of gp91phox and not with p65, suggesting that heterodimer formation may occur in a post-ER compartment. The heme synthesis inhibitor, succinyl acetone, reduced the abundance of mature gp91phox and p22phoxbut had little or no impact on p65.

Activated phagocytes release granule contents and generate reactive oxygen species to kill ingested microorganisms. Potent reactive oxygen species such as hydrogen peroxide and hypochlorous acid generated by phagocytes originate from a superoxide anion (O·̄2) produced by the NADPH-dependent oxidase (1Dinauer M.C. Crit. Rev. Clin. Lab. Sci. 1993; 30: 329-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). The NADPH oxidase is a multicomponent enzyme complex that includes an integral membrane protein, flavocytochrome b 558 (2Segal A.W. Jones O.T.G.

However, during phagocyte activation the cytosolic components translocate to the plasma and/or phagosomal membrane to form the functional enzyme complex (12Clark R.A. Volpp B.D. Leidal K.G. Nauseef W.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1990; 85: 714-721Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar), which generates O·̄2 by transferring electrons from cytosolic NADPH to molecular oxygen (13Robinson J.M.

A genetic defect affecting flavocytochromeb 558, p47phox, or p67phoxresults in a rare inherited disorder known as chronic granulomatous disease (CGD) 1The abbreviations used are: CGD, chronic granulomatous disease; phox , phagocyte oxidase; SA, succinyl acetone; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; PNGase F, peptideN-glycosidase F; Endo H, endoglycosidase H; CRT, calreticulin; MPO, myeloperoxidase; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; β-COP, a 110-kDa subunit of the coat proteins.

Individuals afflicted with CGD develop recurrent and often life-threatening bacterial and fungal infections because of defective microbial killing (1Dinauer M.C. Crit. Rev. Clin. Lab.

The C terminus of gp91phox contains homology with known nucleotide (FAD and NADPH) binding domains of other flavoproteins (18Rotrosen D. Yeung C.L. Leto T.L. Malech H.L. Kwong C.H. Science. 1992; 256: 1459-1462Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar, 19Sumimoto H. Sakamoto N. Nozaki M. Sakaki Y. Takeshige K. Minakami S. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

In addition, we have recently shown that both heme prosthetic groups contained within flavocytochrome b 558 are localized within gp91phox, further supporting the concept that gp91phoxis the subunit mediating electron transport (21Yu L. Quinn M.T. Cross A.R. Dinauer M.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7993-7998Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). However, neither gp91phox itself nor the combination of individual gp91phox and p22phox subunits were able to replace the intact gp91/p22 heterodimer in supporting O·̄2 production in a cell-free NADPH oxidase reconstitution assay, indicating that assembly of the fully functional enzyme complex requires specific interactions between subunits (21Yu L. Quinn M.T. Cross A.R. Dinauer M.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7993-7998Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). In addition, stable expression of gp91phox in phagocytes closely correlates with expression of p22phox as has been observed in CGD patients with mutations in either flavocytochrome b 558 subunit (22Parkos C.A. Dinauer M.C. Jesaitis A.J. Orkin S. Curnutte J.T. Blood. 1989; 73: 1416-1420Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 23Roos D. De Boer M. Kuribayashi F. Meischl C. Weening R.S. Segal A.W. Ahlin A. Nemet K. Hossle J.P. Bernatowska-Matuszkiewicz E. Middleton-Price H. Blood. 1996; 87: 1663-1681Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and has also been shown by in vitro studies using the heme synthesis inhibitor, succinyl acetone (SA) (24Yu L. Zhen L. Dinauer M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27288-27294Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Clarification of the biosynthetic pathway of flavocytochromeb 558 is a logical step toward understanding the determinants for the association of gp91phox and p22phox, which are important for both stability and function of the cytochrome. The mature form of gp91phox migrates as a broad band in SDS-PAGE with an average size of ∼91 kDa because of variable carbohydrate processing (25Kleinberg M.E. Rotrosen D. Malech H.L. J. Immunol. 1989; 143: 4152-4157PubMed Google Scholar). In previous studies, we and others have described a 65-kDa immunochemically related intermediate of gp91phox with high mannose carbohydrate side chains (p65) (24Yu L. Zhen L. Dinauer M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27288-27294Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar,26Porter C.D. Parker M.H. Verhoeven A.J. Levinsky R.J. Collins M.K.L. Kinnon C.

This species was detected in SA-treated PLB-985 cells in which both p22phox and mature gp91phox are absent (24Yu L. Zhen L. Dinauer M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27288-27294Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar) and also in B-cell lines from p22phox-deficient CGD patients (26Porter C.D. Parker M.H. Verhoeven A.J. Levinsky R.J. Collins M.K.L. Kinnon C. Blood. 1994; 84: 2767-2775Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The mature form of gp91phox has post-translationally modifiedN-linked carbohydrate, which resists digestion with endoglycosidase H, indicating that side chains undergo additional processing by mannosidases in the Golgi complex (16Parkos C.A. Allen R.A. Cochrane C.G. Jesaitis A.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1987; 80: 732-742Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar, 24Yu L. Zhen L. Dinauer M.C. J. Biol.

Blood. 1994; 84: 2767-2775Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, the actual sequence of events in the post-translational processing of gp91phox and the subcellular localization of the putative 65-kDa precursor have not yet been characterized. We have previously established a cultured cell model of X-linked CGD by targeted disruption of the gp91phox gene in PLB-985 cells (28Zhen L. King A. Xiao Y. Chanock S. Orkin S. Dinauer M.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 9832-9836Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). After the stable transfection of wild-type gp91phox cDNA into X-CGD PLB-985 cells, expression of the putative 65-kDa precursor and mature gp91phox was constitutive, making it possible to monitor the relationship of their co-expression in biosynthetically active cells. These studies show that gp91phox is generated as a glycosylated 65-kDa precursor in the ER and further suggest that its association with p22phox is not co-translational but is augmented by heme insertion. [35S]Methionine/cysteine (7.18 mCi/0.5 ml) was obtained from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. PeptideN-glycosidase F (PNGase F), endoglycosidase H (Endo H), and fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG were obtained from Boehringer Mannheim. A rabbit reticulocyte lysate kit for transcription and translation reactions was purchased from Promega, Inc. (Madison, WI). Mouse anti-CD11b-fluorescein isothiocyanate and mouse IgG2b-fluorescein isothiocyanate were from Immunotech, Inc. (Westbrook, ME). All other reagents were purchased from Sigma. Antibodies specific for gp91phox and p22phox, monoconal antibodies 48 and 449, respectively, were kindly provided by D. Roos and A. Verhoeven, and monoclonal antibodies 54.1 and 44.1, also specific for gp91phox and p22phox, respectively, were provided by A. J. Jesaitis, M. T. Quinn, and J. B. Burritt. Rabbit polyclonal antibody specific for p67phox was generously provided by P. Heyworth. An antibody specific for β-COP, clone M3A5, was obtained from Sigma. The human promyelocytic cell line PLB-985 (obtained from P. Newburger, University of Massachusetts), PLB-985 X-CGD, and gp91 PLB cells (28Zhen L. King A. Xiao Y. Chanock S. Orkin S. Dinauer M.C.

Chem. 1998; 273: 6575-6581Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) were maintained in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum as described previously (24Yu L. Zhen L. Dinauer M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27288-27294Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). For granulocytic differentiation, cells were induced with 0.5%N,N-dimethylformamide for 5 days in CO2-independent medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) in the absence of fetal bovine serum but supplied with Nutridoma-SP (Boehringer Mannheim) and 2 mml-glutamine. During differentiation, the acquisition of O·̄2-generating capacity was determined by either nitro blue tetrazolium reduction or by the reduction of cytochrome c following stimulation with 0.10 μg/ml 4β-phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (24Yu L. Zhen L. Dinauer M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27288-27294Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). In the studies using SA, cells were differentiated withN,N-dimethylformamide in the presence of 10.0 μg/ml SA or in the presence of an equal volume of sterile phosphate-buffered saline for 5 days prior to experimentation. Cell growth, viability, and morphological changes were unaffected by SA (data not shown). The cDNA for gp91phox was transcribed and translated in vitrousing a rabbit reticulocyte lysate assay according to the manufacturer's instructions. 5–10 μl of each reaction was resolved by 5–20% SDS-PAGE, and gels were fixed, soaked in 1.2 msodium salicylate, dried, and then exposed to Kodak X-Omat film for 2–6 h. Subcellular fractionations were performed as described previously (30DeLeo F.R. Goedken M. McCormick S.J. Nauseef W.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 2900-2909Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Briefly, gp91 PLB cells were seeded at 2 × 105 cells/ml in culture medium and cultured for 60 h. 1.5–2.0 × 107 cells were washed once in 30 ml of phosphate-buffered saline and N2 cavitated in 0.5 ml of relaxation buffer as described by Borregaard et al. (31Borregaard N. Heiple J.M. Simons E.R. Clark R.A. J. Cell Biol. 1983; 97: 52-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (653) Google Scholar). Postnuclear supernatants were loaded on a 10–60% continuous sucrose gradient and centrifuged at 35,000 rpm (151,000 ×g av) in an SW41 rotor (Beckman Instruments) for 15 h at 4 °C, and 0.5-ml fractions were collected from the bottom of each tube. The linearity of these gradients was determined using a refractometer and was similar to that previously reported (r 2 = 0.993) (30DeLeo F.R. Goedken M. McCormick S.J. Nauseef W.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 2900-2909Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The distribution of protein in the gradient was measured with the BCA protein assay (Pierce). Two separate protein peaks were identified in fractions 8 and 20, containing 110 and 340 μg/ml protein, respectively. To identify gp91phox, p65, p22phox, p47phox, calreticulin (CRT), and β-COP distribution, 20 μl of each fraction was mixed 1:1 with 2× SDS sample buffer and resolved by 10% SDS-PAGE, and immunoblots were probed with the indicated antibodies (see above). 20 μl of each sucrose gradient fraction was denatured by heating in the presence of 0.2% SDS and then diluted 2-fold with the appropriate enzyme buffer. Digestions with PNGase F or Endo H were performed using 0.5 milliunit of PNGase F and 10 milliunits of Endo H, respectively, for 1 h at 37 °C as per the manufacturer's instructions. 6× SDS sample buffer was added to digestions, and samples were resolved by SDS-PAGE. Total cellular RNA was isolated, separated on a 1.0% formaldehyde agarose gel system (24Yu L. Zhen L. Dinauer M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27288-27294Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar), and then transferred to Magnacharge nylon membrane (Micron Separations Inc., Westboro, MA). Blots were hybridized with32P-labeled cDNA probes to human gp91phox, p22phox, and β-actin, and the intensity of the signals was quantitated by densitometry. Cells treated with SA or phosphate-buffered saline (control) for 5 days were stained with 7D5 (a generous gift of Dr. Michio Nakamura, Nagasaki University, Japan), a gp91phox monoclonal antibody that reacts with an extracellular epitope of the cytochrome (32Mizuno Y. Hara T. Nakamura M. Ueda K. Minakami S. Take H. J. Pediatr. 1988; 113: 458-462Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 33Nakamura M. Murakami M. Koga T. Tanaka Y. Minakami S. Blood. 1987; 69: 1404-1408Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Surface expression of CD11b (Immunotech) was assessed in a similar fashion, and IgG1 and IgG2b were used as antibody isotype controls for 7D5 and anti-CD11b, respectively. Following staining, samples were analyzed using a FACScan flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson, San Jose, CA). Intact cells (5 × 107/ml) were solubilized in a buffer containing 1% Triton X-100, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, and 1 mm EDTA (24Yu L. Zhen L. Dinauer M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27288-27294Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar), and proteins were resolved by 12% SDS-PAGE (34Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 222: 680-685Crossref Scopus (207538) Google Scholar). Alternatively, 20 μl of each sucrose gradient fraction was resolved by 10% SDS-PAGE. Proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose (35Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44939) Google Scholar), and blots were probed with antibodies specific for gp91phox, p22phox, p47phox, p67phox, myeloperoxidase (MPO), CRT, and β-COP (see above). Immunoblots were developed using an enhanced chemiluminescence detection system (SuperSignal Substrate, Pierce) according to the manufacturer's instructions. We and others have postulated that gp91phox is synthesized as a 65-kDa precursor (p65) in the ER and that subsequent carbohydrate processing in the Golgi complex yields mature gp91phox (24Yu L. Zhen L. Dinauer M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27288-27294Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 26Porter C.D. Parker M.H. Verhoeven A.J. Levinsky R.J. Collins M.K.L. Kinnon C. Blood. 1994; 84: 2767-2775Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To identify the initial precursor of gp91phox, we used cDNA encoding gp91phox to prime biosynthesis in an in vitro transcription and translation system. We have previously demonstrated that in this system the nonglycosylated core polypeptide precursor of MPO is generated using MPO cDNA (30DeLeo F.R. Goedken M. McCormick S.J. Nauseef W.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 2900-2909Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). When purified ER microsomes were then added to the system, both unglycosylated and high-mannose type N-linked glycosylated forms of precursor MPO were produced (30DeLeo F.R. Goedken M. McCormick S.J. Nauseef W.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 2900-2909Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Using gp91phox cDNA in the absence of ER microsomes, gp91phox was translated as a 58-kDa polypeptide (Fig. 1), a finding consistent with the size of the gp91phox core protein previously described by Parkos et al. (16Parkos C.A. Allen R.A. Cochrane C.G. Jesaitis A.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1987; 80: 732-742Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar) and others following removal of carbohydrate with PNGase F (24Yu L. Zhen L. Dinauer M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27288-27294Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 25Kleinberg M.E. Rotrosen D. Malech H.L. J. Immunol. 1989; 143: 4152-4157PubMed Google Scholar, 36Harper A.M. Chaplin M.F. Segal A.W. Biochem. J. 1985; 227: 783-788Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). In the presence of added ER microsomes, both the 58-kDa core polypeptide and p65 were generated (Fig. 1). Because generation of p65 was dependent on the presence of ER microsomes containing the necessary machinery forN-linked glycosylation, these data clearly indicate that p65 is a precursor of the 91-kDa form of gp91phox and is synthesized in the ER. Using a similar assay system to delineate sites of N-linked glycosylation, Wallach and Segal (37Wallach T.M. Segal A.W. Biochem. J. 1997; 321: 583-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) observed that gp91phox cDNA was translated into polypeptides of ∼50 kDa in the absence of ER microsomes and variably glycosylated species of 53–60 kDa when ER microsomes were present. Thus, the identity of the primary translation product was not established. By contrast, our data demonstrate that these species are 58 kDa when translated without microsomes and 65 kDa with added microsomes. The reasons for these differences are uncertain, but may be related to technical variations in the in vitro translation and/or gel electrophoresis system. We have previously established a cultured cell model of X-linked CGD by targeted disruption of the gp91phox gene in PLB-985 myelomonoblastic cells (28Zhen L. King A. Xiao Y. Chanock S. Orkin S. Dinauer M.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 9832-9836Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). These cells are unable to produce O·̄2 after granulocytic differentiation because of the absence of endogenous gp91phox (29Zhen L. Yu L. Dinauer M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6575-6581Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Stable transfection of X-CGD PLB-985 cells with the wild-type gp91phox cDNA under control of the constitutively active EF1α promoter resulted in continuous expression of gp91phox even in undifferentiated cells and restored O·̄2-generating capacity upon granulocytic differentiation (28Zhen L. King A. Xiao Y. Chanock S. Orkin S. Dinauer M.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 9832-9836Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar, 29Zhen L. Yu L. Dinauer M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6575-6581Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). To further address the subcellular location of p65 in gp91phox-transfected cells (gp91 PLB), we separated subcellular organelles by sucrose density gradient centrifugation as described previously (30DeLeo F.R. Goedken M. McCormick S.J. Nauseef W.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 2900-2909Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Following centrifugation, 0.5-ml fractions were collected, and organelles were identified by the presence of specific marker proteins as described previously (30DeLeo F.R. Goedken M. McCormick S.J. Nauseef W.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 2900-2909Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). ER (CRT and 90-kDa precursor MPO), lysosomes (59-kDa heavy subunit of mature MPO), Golgi (β-COP), plasma membrane (cell surface biotinylation), and cytosol (p47phox) were identified and compared with the sedimentation of gp91phox, p22phox, and p65 (Fig.2 A). Fractions containing peak levels of gp91phox (fractions 10–13) corresponded to those containing peak levels of p22phox (fractions 10–13) (Fig.2 A). gp91phox in fraction 12 was resistant to digestion with Endo H, indicating that its subcellular localization is likely that of a post-ER and/or post-Golgi vesicle, because it has already undergone carbohydrate modification (Fig. 2 B). Fractions 7–9 contained peak levels of p65 that co-sedimented with ER markers CRT and precursor MPO (90 kDa) (Fig. 2 A). In contrast to gp91phox, p65 was found to be susceptible to digestion with both Endo H and PNGase F consistent with previous reports (24Yu L. Zhen L. Dinauer M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27288-27294Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 26Porter C.D. Parker M.H. Verhoeven A.J. Levinsky R.J. Collins M.K.L. Kinnon C. Blood. 1994; 84: 2767-2775Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and with its localization in the ER (Fig.2 B). Though peak levels of p65 were found in fractions 7–9, its decreasing distribution toward lesser density in the gradient was countered by the increasing distribution of gp91phox in those same fractions (fractions 7–13) (Fig. 2 A). The overall distributions of p65 and gp91phox revealed an apparent ER-to-Golgi continuum separated in the sucrose density gradient as fraction 7 contained mainly p65, whereas fraction 13 contained only gp91phox (Fig. 2 A, top panel). Only the mature form of gp91phox was found in fractions corresponding to the β-COP-associated organelles, implying that p65 had been completely processed to mature gp91phox prior to reaching the region of the Golgi associated with β-COP (Fig. 2 A). It is notable that the distribution of β-COP may reflect only a subset of Golgi vesicles and/or part of the Golgi complex (Fig. 2 A). We additionally observed that the majority of gp91phox and p22phox was intracellular with only a small fraction associated with biotinylated plasma membrane proteins (fractions 16–18) (Fig.2 A). This observation has been confirmed by immunofluorescence microscopy as well (29Zhen L. Yu L. Dinauer M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6575-6581Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Finally, p22phox distribution appeared unassociated with ER-associated p65, suggesting that heterodimer formation was not a co-translational event and likely occurred in a post-ER compartment (Fig.2 A). Although both gp91phox and p22phox were associated with organelles that co-sedimented with those containing a 59-kDa heavy subunit of mature MPO (lysosomes and/or azurophilic granules), we found that the intracellular pool of gp91phox and p22phox was not lysosomal, because plasma membrane expression of the cytochrome was not up-regulated when these cells were differentiated and then treated with dihydrocytochalasin B and 1 mmformylmethionylleucylphenylalanine (data not shown). However, β-glucuronidase, a lysosomal marker, was released following treatment with dihydrocytochalasin B and formylmethionylleucylphenylalanine, indicating that degranulation had occurred (data not shown). Therefore, the intracellular pool of gp91phox and p22phox was not contained within lysosomal or azurophilic granule membranes. Synthesis of heme is essential for complete processing of hemoproteins such as MPO and for enzymatic activity (38Pinnix I.B. Guzman G.S. Bonkovsky H.L. Zaki S.R. Kinkade Jr., J.M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1994; 312: 447-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 39Nauseef W.M. McCormick S. Yi H. Blood. 1992; 80: 2622-2633Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 40Nauseef W.M. Cogley M. McCormick S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9546-9549Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). To determine whether inhibition of heme synthesis affected flavocytochrome b 558 biosynthesis in gp91 PLB cells, we treated these cells with SA and examined the expression of gp91phox, p22phox, and p65 after 5 days of granulocytic differentiation withN,N-dimethylformamide. As shown in Fig.3 A, differentiated gp91 PLB cells developed significant O·̄2-generating capacity in comparison with that in undifferentiated cells that do not express the cytosolic oxidase components p47phox and p67phox (Fig.3 C). The O·̄2-generating capacity in differentiated gp91 PLB cells was reduced significantly upon SA treatment (Fig.3 A). Immunoblot analysis of whole cell extracts showed that decreased activity was associated with reduced expression of both p22phox and gp91phox (Fig. 3 B). The induced expression of other oxidase components p47phox and p67phox, non-heme-containing proteins, was unaffected by SA treatment (Fig. 3 C). The SA-dependent reduction of transgenic gp91phox expression is consistent with our previous findings on endogenously expressed gp91phox in differentiated PLB-985 cells (24Yu L. Zhen L. Dinauer M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27288-27294Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar), providing further evidence that heme incorporation is important for stable expression of the gp91/p22 heterodimer. By contrast, expression of p65 was unaffected by SA treatment, which is a finding similar to what has been described in SA-treated PLB-985 cells (Fig. 3 B) (24Yu L. Zhen L. Dinauer M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27288-27294Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Furthermore, these data suggest that p22phox does not interact with p65 in the absence of heme incorporation, because stable expression of p22phox is not supported by the continued presence of p65 in SA-treated cells. Unaltered expression of p65 in SA-treated cells suggested that transcription and/or translation of gp91phox mRNA was not blocked by inhibition of heme synthesis. Northern blot analysis showed similar levels of transgenic gp91phox mRNAs in both undifferentiated and differentiated gp91 PLB cells in the absence or presence of SA (Fig. 4). The abundance of endogenous p22phox mRNA increased following differentiation and was unaffected by SA treatment (Fig. 4). Thus, the decreased expression of the 91-kDa form of gp91phox and of p22phox by SA was not because of reduced levels of gp91phox or p22phox transcripts. These data along with the presence of p65 in SA-treated cells suggest that heme plays a role in the post-translational processing of flavocytochromeb 558 rather than gene expression. We have previously shown that the transgenic expression of gp91phox also resulted in its plasma membrane association, indicating it is fully processed in these cells (29Zhen L. Yu L. Dinauer M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6575-6581Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Because a small portion of mature gp91phox was found in the plasma membrane-enriched fractions of gp91 PLB cells (Fig. 2 A) (fractions 15–18), reduced expression of mature gp91phox in SA-treated gp91 PLB cells should correlate with its reduced cell surface expression. To confirm this hypothesis, we examined plasma membrane expression of gp91phox in SA-treated or untreated differentiated gp91 PLB cells by flow cytometry using the monoclonal antibody, 7D5 (32Mizuno Y. Hara T. Nakamura M. Ueda K. Minakami S. Take H. J. Pediatr. 1988; 113: 458-462Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 33Nakamura M. Murakami M. Koga T. Tanaka Y. Minakami S. Blood. 1987; 69: 1404-1408Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). 7D5 recognizes an extracellular epitope of gp91phox (21Yu L. Quinn M.T. Cross A.R. Dinauer M.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7993-7998Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). 2A. Yamauchi, L. Yu, A. Postgens, F. DeLeo, F. Kuribayashi, H. Nunoi, S. Kanegasaki, D. Roos, W. Nauseef, H. Malech, M. Dinauer, and M. Nakamura, personal communication. As shown in Fig. 5 A, cells not treated with SA contain surface-expressed gp91phox. In contrast, treatment with SA reduced gp91phox surface expression to a level comparable with that of the IgG1 control antibody, a finding consistent with data obtained by immunoblotting (compare Figs.3 B and 5 A). Decreased expression of gp91phox by SA treatment was specific for heme-containing proteins, as the cell surface expression of the β2-integrin (CD11b/CD18), a non-heme-containing heterodimer, was unaffected, demonstrating that normal protein processing was unaffected by SA treatment (Fig. 5 B). Flavocytochrome b 558 is primarily expressed in phagocytic cells. In neutrophils, it has been well established that ∼85% of the cytochrome is found in the membranes of specific granules and gelatinase-containing granules with the remainder residing in the secretory vesicles and plasma membrane (31Borregaard N. Heiple J.M. Simons E.R. Clark R.A. J. Cell Biol. 1983; 97: 52-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (653) Google Scholar, 41Borregaard N. Cowland J.B. Blood. 1997; 89: 3503-3521Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Stability of flavocytochrome b 558 is dependent on co-expression of both gp91phox and p22phox (16Parkos C.A. Allen R.A. Cochrane C.G. Jesaitis A.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1987; 80: 732-742Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar, 22Parkos C.A. Dinauer M.C. Jesaitis A.J. Orkin S. Curnutte J.T. Blood. 1989; 73: 1416-1420Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, a putative 65-kDa precursor (p65) of gp91phox was described in Epstein-Barr virus-transformed B-cell lines derived from individuals with X-CGD and p22phox-deficient CGD (26Porter C.D. Parker M.H. Verhoeven A.J. Levinsky R.J. Collins M.K.L. Kinnon C. Blood. 1994; 84: 2767-2775Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 27Porter C.D. Kuribayashi F. Parkar M.H. Roos D. Kinnon C. Biochem. J. 1996; 315: 571-575Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) and also in the human promyelocytic leukemia cell line, PLB-985 (24Yu L. Zhen L. Dinauer M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27288-27294Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Although antibodies specific for the peptide backbone of gp91phox also recognize p65, p65 is undetectable in mature neutrophils, perhaps because of their low biosynthetic activity and the highly proteolytic environment. Our current studies investigated directly the processing of gp91phox using gp91phox-transfected PLB-985 X-CGD cells in which mature gp91phox as well as p65 were constitutively expressed. No 58-kDa gp91phox core polypeptide was detected in the transfected cells, suggesting that the addition of asparagineN-linked glycosylation was a co-translational process during biosynthesis. Our data from in vitro transcription and translation assays using gp91phox cDNA strongly support that gp91phox is synthesized and co-translationally modified as p65. These results are supported by the earlier work of Wallach and Segal (37Wallach T.M. Segal A.W. Biochem. J. 1997; 321: 583-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) who found that the initial translational product of gp91phox cDNA is glycosylated in the presence of ER microsomes. Previously, we found that p65 contained high mannose-type carbohydrates as determined by its sensitivity to Endo H digestion (24Yu L. Zhen L. Dinauer M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27288-27294Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar); however, mature gp91phox was Endo H-resistant, consistent with its acquisition of complex carbohydrate side chains after further processing in the Golgi complex (16Parkos C.A. Allen R.A. Cochrane C.G. Jesaitis A.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1987; 80: 732-742Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar, 24Yu L. Zhen L. Dinauer M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27288-27294Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). The distribution of p22phox in sucrose gradients paralleled that of the 91-kDa form of gp91phox, which suggested that p22phox did not associate with p65 in the ER but that heterodimer formation occurs later in flavocytochromeb 558 biosynthesis. Our co-sedimentation data are consistent with the observations in SA-treated gp91 PLB cells in which p65 was persistently expressed in contrast to the decreased expression of p22phox and the mature 91-kDa form of gp91phox and also supported by the observations of Porter et al. (26Porter C.D. Parker M.H. Verhoeven A.J. Levinsky R.J. Collins M.K.L. Kinnon C. Blood. 1994; 84: 2767-2775Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) who were able to detect p65 in p22phox-deficient CGD individuals who lacked the 91-kDa form of gp91phox secondarily. We have previously demonstrated that both complete processing ofN-linked carbohydrates and correct targeting of gp91phox to plasma membranes can be achieved in the absence of p22phox in non-myeloid COS7 cells (24Yu L. Zhen L. Dinauer M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27288-27294Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 21Yu L. Quinn M.T. Cross A.R. Dinauer M.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7993-7998Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar), indicating that an association of p65 with p22phox is not a prerequisite for these events. These earlier findings are consistent with our current results, because co-sedimentation of p22phox with gp91phox in sucrose gradients is not observed until gp91phox is modified to its 91-kDa form (Fig. 2 A) (fractions 9–14). The compartment in which heterodimer formation occurs between p22phox and gp91phox or an intermediate species as it is processed from its p65 to mature 91-kDa form is likely to be post-ER or Golgi. Heterodimer formation appears to be important for increased stability of both subunits against degradation in the proteolytic environment in phagocytes and may also facilitate the subsequent targeting of the gp91/p22 heterodimer to the plasma membrane or, in neutrophils, specific granule membranes. In SA-treated cells, p65 was more stable than either p22phox or mature gp91phox, suggesting that heme incorporation augments heterodimer formation in an as of yet undefined way. Previous studies using p22phox-deficient lymphoblasts also revealed that the abundance of a 65-kDa protein detected with antibody specific for gp91phox was unaffected in the absence of p22phox (26Porter C.D. Parker M.H. Verhoeven A.J. Levinsky R.J. Collins M.K.L. Kinnon C. Blood. 1994; 84: 2767-2775Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); however, formation of the mature form of gp91phox could be rescued by expression of transgenic p22phox (26Porter C.D. Parker M.H. Verhoeven A.J. Levinsky R.J. Collins M.K.L. Kinnon C. Blood. 1994; 84: 2767-2775Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Because p22phox neither binds heme nor is glycosylated, its stability appears to be regulated by the abundance of heme-containing gp91phox. Heme insertion has no impact on p65 stability either because it occurs during or after carbohydrate modification to produce the 91-kDa form of gp91phox or because heme-associated gp91phox is required for subsequent p22phox binding. Because we have recently shown that both heme prosthetic groups are contained solely within gp91phox, neither heme is directly involved in dimerization but may impart a required conformation for heterodimer formation (21Yu L. Quinn M.T. Cross A.R. Dinauer M.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7993-7998Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). We recently reported that impaired MPO biosynthesis because of a missense mutation (R569W) resulted in the inability of MPO to acquire heme and subsequent peroxidase activity in transfected K562 cells (40Nauseef W.M. Cogley M. McCormick S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9546-9549Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). In those cells, MPO containing the R569W mutation was not processed to mature heavy and light subunits, suggesting that heme insertion was necessary for protein maturation (40Nauseef W.M. Cogley M. McCormick S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9546-9549Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). In a similar fashion, impaired heme insertion resulting from SA treatment blocked heterodimer formation in flavocytochromeb 558. Because p65 expression is unaffected by SA treatment and heterodimers are not formed, the fate of p65 synthesized in the absence of heme synthesis is unknown. Further studies are necessary to elucidate how the association between gp91phox and p22phox promotes their increased expression in comparison with that of the unassembled subunits. The sites of interaction between the two subunits have not yet been described, and further studies will also be needed to address the timing of heme insertion and its role in flavocytochromeb 558 stability. It is likely that observations in this system will have application to the biosynthesis and targeting of other heme-containing multisubunit proteins. We thank Drs. Algirdas J. Jesaitis, James B.

We demonstrate that SAA is synergistically induced in synovial cells by interleukin (IL)-1 and IL-6 that are present at significantly high level in the synovial fluid of arthritis patients. These cytokines induced phenotypic changes in synovial cells, promoting protrusion and increased cellular contact. Induction of SAA under this condition is mediated by promoter elements located between −254 and −226, which contains binding sites for transcription factors Sp1 and SAA activating sequence binding factor (SAF). Mutation of these sequences abolishes SAA promoter response to IL-1 and IL-6. The role of Sp1 in SAA induction was demonstrated by increased DNA binding activity, phosphorylation, and increased protein content of Sp1 during cytokine treatment. Sp1 interacts with the SAA promoter in association with SAF as an SAF·Sp1 heteromeric complex. Furthermore, using a phosphatase inhibitor, we demonstrated increased transactivation potential of both Sp1 and SAF as a consequence of a phosphorylation event. These results provide first evidence for cytokine-mediated activation of Sp1 in synovial fibroblast cells and its participation in regulating SAA expression by acting in conjunction with SAF.

Its level increases up to 1,000-fold in response to both acute and chronic inflammatory conditions. Consistent with this observation, the plasma concentration of SAA in arthritis patients may range from 1 to 1,000 μg/ml or more (1Benson M.D. Cohen A.S. Arthritis Rheum. 1979; 22: 36-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 2Koj A. Gordon A.H. Koj A. The Acute Phase Response to Injury and Infection. Elsevier, Amsterdam1985: 139-144Google Scholar), and SAA has been found in abundance in the synovial fluid recovered from inflamed joints of rheumatoid arthritis patients (3Sukenik S. Henkin J. Zimlichman S. Skibin A. Neuman L. Pras M. Horowitz J. Shainkin-Kestenbaum R. J. Rheumatol. 1988; 15: 942-945PubMed Google Scholar, 4Kumon Y. Loose L.D. Birbara C.A. Sipe J.D. J. Rheumatol. 1997; 24: 14-19PubMed Google Scholar). Current hypothesis suggests that locally synthesized SAA by synovial fibroblast cells in the inflamed joints acts as an autocrine inducer of matrix metalloproteinase-1 (collagenase), the only enzyme that degrades interstitial collagen I, II, and III at neutral pH and causes extensive joint erosion (5Strissel K.J.

Invest. 1991; 87: 1177-1185Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Synovial fluid samples obtained from the knee joints of rheumatoid arthritis patients have been found to contain high levels of IL-1, IL-6, and a few other proinflammatory cytokines that may play a critical role in the manifestation of chronic inflammation and articular destruction (7Yanni G. Whelan A. Feighery C. Bersnihan B. Ann. Rheum. Dis. 1994; 53: 39-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Presence of high levels of proinflammatory cytokines could possibly trigger local production of SAA in the synovial fibroblast cells. Indeed, it has been shown that in synovial fibroblast cells, IL-1 can induce SAA expression (6Mitchell T.I. Coon C.I. Brinckerhoff C.E. J. Clin. Invest. 1991; 87: 1177-1185Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). However, the molecular mechanism by which IL-1-mediated SAA gene induction occurs is not well understood. Moreover, the combinatorial effect of IL-1 and IL-6, the two cytokines found in abundance in synovial fluid of rheumatoid arthritis patients, in SAA gene expression in synovial fibroblast cells is also unknown. The present study was undertaken to elucidate the mechanism by which IL-1 and IL-6 stimulate SAA in synovial cells. Because of its link with rheumatoid arthritis, amyloidosis, and atherosclerosis, the mechanism of SAA gene induction for the past few years has been a subject of intense investigation by many laboratories, including ours. SAA biosynthesis during acute-phase response is highly induced in the liver, and its concentration drops rapidly to a low background level within a few days. The increase of SAA biosynthesis during inflammation is due largely to its increased transcription (8Lowell C.A. Stearman R.S. Morrow J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 8453-8461Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Stability of mRNA also contributes to the enhanced expression of SAA in mouse (9Rienhoff H.Y. Groudine M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 3710-3716Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) and human (10Jiang S.L. Lozanski G. Samols D. Kushner I. J. Immunol. 1995; 154: 825-831PubMed Google Scholar, 11Jiang S.L.

Involvement of common promoter elements in these species indicates a signaling and response pathway that presumably remained conserved during evolution. Although liver is a major site of SAA expression, extrahepatic tissues are also involved in expressing this gene. Such a local production of SAA is linked to the pathogenesis of several diseases. For example, in rheumatoid arthritis, SAA biosynthesis in the synovial cells of joint tissue is highly induced (3Sukenik S. Henkin J. Zimlichman S. Skibin A. Neuman L. Pras M. Horowitz J.

Schreiber B.M. Scand. J. Immunol. 1997; 46: 284-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) is likely to play a significant role in atherosclerosis. Recent studies indicate that SAA is also synthesized in the brain (25Liang J.S. Sloane J.A. Wells J.M. Abraham C.R. Fine R.E. Sipe J.D. Neurosci. Lett. 1997; 225: 73-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Although it is expressed in both hepatic and extrahepatic cells, the expression level of SAA has been found to vary markedly depending on the cell types (26Meek R.L. Benditt E.P. J. Exp. Med. 1986; 164: 2006-2016Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar) and on the nature of inflammatory agents (27Ray A. Ray B.K. DNA Cell Biol. 1997; 16: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Part of the difference lies with the complexity of the SAA gene with the presence of multiple isoforms in many species (reviewed in Ref. 28Jensen L.E. Hiney M.P. Shields D.C. Uhlar C.M. Lindsay A.J. Whitehead A.S. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 384-392PubMed Google Scholar). In humans, for example, multiple SAA isoforms, designated as SAA 1–4 have been reported among which SAA4 is constitutively expressed, SAA3 is not expressed, and SAA1 and SAA2 isoforms are expressed with varying degrees of induction in different tissues. In mouse, five SAA isoforms have been reported. Mouse SAA1 and SAA2 isoforms are expressed and induced predominantly in the liver, whereas SAA3 isoform is induced in multiple tissues during inflammation. Similar to human SAA4, mouse SAA5 is constitutively expressed, although mouse SAA4, which is analogous to human SAA3, is not expressed. In rabbit so far three isoforms of SAA have been reported. Nonhepatic induction of mouse SAA3 has been extensively studied, which revealed that C/EBP-δ and SAA enhancing factor are major regulators (13Huang J.H. Liao W.S.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 4475-4484Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). In rabbit, besides C/EBP and NF-κB, a novel transcription factor termed as SAF is involved in the cytokine-induced expression of rabbit SAA2 gene (29Ray A. Ray B.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1584-1594Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). In this report, we provide the first evidence of the involvement of Sp1 in inducing rabbit SAA2 gene expression in response to IL-1 and IL-6 cytokines in synovial cells. Rabbit synoviocyte (HIG82) cells were obtained from American Type Culture Collection. HIG82 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing high glucose (4.5 g/liter) supplemented with 7% fetal calf serum. HIG82 synoviocytes were derived from the interarticular soft tissue of the knee joint of a normal female New Zealand White rabbit. These cells have retained many of the features and, similar to the tissue of origin, are activated by phorbol myristic acid and express genes coding for enzymes such as collagenase, gelatinase, and caseinase. For induction, HIG82 cells were stimulated with IL-1β (200 units/ml), IL-6 (1000 units/ml), or both for 48 h. Transient transfections of HIG82 cells were carried out by the calcium phosphate method (30Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Transfections were carried out using a mixture of DNAs containing 10 μg of chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) reporter plasmid, 2 μg of plasmid pSV-β-gal (Promega) as a control for measuring transfection efficiency, and carrier DNA so that the total amount of DNA in each transfection remained constant at 16 μg. Cells were harvested 48 h post-transfection, and CAT activity was determined from cell extracts as described previously (30Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). For CAT assays, extracts were heated at 60 °C for 10 min to inactivate endogenous acetylase and assayed for β-galactosidase activity. Different effectors used in the transfection assay had no effect on β-galactosidase expression. An equivalent amount of each cell extract was used in the determination of CAT activity. All values reported have been corrected for background activity, which was determined from mock-transfected cells. All transfection experiments were performed at least three times. The progressively deleted CAT reporter plasmids, pSAA(−401/+63)CAT, pSAA(−314/+63)CAT, pSAA(−280/+63)CAT, pSAA(−193/+63)CAT, pSAA(−135/+63)CAT and pSAA(−35/+63)CAT were constructed by cloning various portions of the SAA promoter into the basic promoterless plasmid vector pBLCAT3 (31Luckow B. Schutz G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 5490-5491Crossref PubMed Scopus (1401) Google Scholar). Progressive deletions from the 5′-end of the rabbit SAA gene promoter fragments were constructed by using restriction endonuclease cleavage sites present in the SAA gene or using the polymerase chain reaction method to create suitable fragments of the SAA promoter. Plasmids pSAA(−280/−193)CAT, pSAA(−254/−193)CAT and pSAA(−254/−226)CAT were constructed using plasmid vector pBLCAT2 (31Luckow B. Schutz G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 5490-5491Crossref PubMed Scopus (1401) Google Scholar). pBLCAT2 contains an human sarcoma virus thymidine kinase promoter. Background effect of this vector was normalized by separately transfecting cells with the plasmid vector in an amount equal to that used for SAA promoter-containing pBLCAT2 derivatives and grown in the absence and in the presence of IL-1 and IL-6. These cytokines did not have any effect on pBLCAT2 vector alone. The mutated pmtSAA(−254/−226)CAT plasmid was constructed by ligating a mutated sequence to the plasmid vector pBLCAT2. The sequence of mutated oligonucleotide was 5′-CAATGAGTCGAGACCGTCGACATCCATGG-3′. Underlined bases represent altered sequences. The rationale for selecting the sites for mutation was based upon fine-structure mapping of SAF-binding site followed by a systematic base substitution analysis of this region. Full-length functional Sp1 cDNA and a mutated frameshift Sp1 cDNA were isolated from pSVSp1F and pSVSp1FX plasmids (32Saffer J.D. Jackson S.P. Thurston S.J. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 659-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) and subcloned into pCMV4 vector. pCMVSAF (23Ray B.K. Ray A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28948-28953Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) contained a cDNA-encoding SAF cloned into pCMV4. HIG82 cells were fixed in 1% glutaraldehyde in 0.08 m sodium cacodylate buffer (pH 7.4) at room temperature and washed in the same buffer. The samples were post-fixed with 1% osmium tetroxide in distilled water for 1 h, dehydrated in a graded series of ethanol, critical point dried, sputter coated with gold, and viewed with a Jeol JSM 35 scanning microscope. HIG82 cells grown on a glass coverslip were rinsed in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), pH 7.4, and fixed for 10 min at room temperature in 3.7% formaldehyde solution. After three washes in PBS, the cells were incubated by placing the coverslips in 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS for 5 min, followed by three washes in PBS. The cells were then stained with rhodamine-conjugated phalloidin for 30 min, washed in PBS, and the coverslips were mounted on slides for viewing with fluorescence microscope. Total RNA was isolated from uninduced and various cytokine-induced HIG82 cells by using guanidinium thiocyanate method (33Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63084) Google Scholar). 50 μg of each sample of RNA was fractionated in a 1.1% agarose gel containing 2.2m formaldehyde and transferred onto nylon membrane, and the blot was hybridized to 32P-labeled specific cDNA probes described in the figure legends. The same membrane was subsequently hybridized to an actin cDNA probe to evaluate the relative amount of each RNA sample on the membrane. The sequences of oligonucleotides used in this study are: wild-type Sp1, 5′-TCGACTGGGCGGAGTCTGGA-3′; mutant Sp1, 5′-TCGATCACCATAGTCTGGA-3′; wild-type SAA (−254/−226), 5′-CCCTTCCTCTCCACCCACAGCCCCCATGG-3′; mutant SAA (−254/−226), 5′-CAATGAGTCGAGACCGTCGACATCCATGG-3′. Underlined bases represent altered sequences determined by base substitution analysis of SAF-binding region. Nuclear extract was prepared from uninduced and cytokine-induced cells and protein content was measured (34Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (214351) Google Scholar). In electromobility shift assays for the detection of DNA-protein interaction, equal protein amounts of nuclear extract were incubated with a radiolabeled DNA probe as described (29Ray A. Ray B.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1584-1594Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar).32P-Labeled double-stranded DNA probes were labeled by filling in the overhangs at the termini with a Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase, incorporating [α-32P]dCTP. In some binding assays, competitor oligonucleotides were included in the reaction mixture. For antibody interaction studies, antibodies were added to the reaction mixture during a preincubation period of 30 min on ice. Anti-Sp1 antibody was obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology and anti-SAF antibody was prepared as described (23Ray B.K. Ray A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28948-28953Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Nuclear extracts (30 μg of protein) were fractionated in a sodium dodecyl sulfate-12% polyacrylamide gel and transferred onto nitrocellulose membrane using an electroblotter (Research Products International Corp.). For the evaluation of relative amounts of proteins in each lane, proteins were stained with Coomassie Blue. Immunoblotting was performed using the abovementioned primary antibodies and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody. Chemiluminescence reaction was performed with ECL detection kit using the manufacturer's protocol (Amersham Life Science Ltd). Dephosphorylation of nuclear extracts was carried out by using calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase as described (29Ray A. Ray B.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1584-1594Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). As a control, some reaction mixtures contained, in addition to calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase, a combination of phosphatase inhibitors (50 mm NaF, 5 μm okadaic acid, and 1 mm sodium orthovanadate). These treated nuclear extracts were used in the electromobility shift assays as described. To determine the pattern by which SAA is expressed in synovium exposed to cytokines, rabbit synovial cells (HIG82) were incubated in the presence of IL-1, IL-6, and IL-1 plus IL-6, and the level of SAA mRNA was measured by Northern blot analysis. As shown in Fig.1, IL-1 alone had a higher stimulatory effect than IL-6, whereas the combination of IL-1 and IL-6 synergistically activated SAA mRNA expression. Cytokine-treated cells exhibited striking morphological changes when visualized using a phase contrast microscope (data not shown). To further verify the cytokine-induced cytoskeletal structural modification, we have analyzed the cells by scanning electron microscopy (Fig. 2). This analysis revealed long protrusions in cytokine-treated cells that extend from one cell and interact with surrounding cells in culture. Such protrusions are characteristic of cells attempting to establish a connection with other cells to form an association that are seen in cells undergoing differentiation. This process is facilitated by the polymerization of actin that forms filamentous or F-actin giving rise to polymorphic shapes of the cells with pseudopod-like protrusions (35Horackova M. Byczko Z. Exp. Cell Res. 1997; 237: 158-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Formation of such structural configuration was evaluated by rhodamine-conjugated phalloidin staining for F-actin and visualized by fluorescence microscopy as described (36Cline C.A. Schatten H. Balczon R. Schatten G. Cell Motility. 1983; 3: 513-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Results of this experiment, shown in Fig. 3, revealed significant formation of F-actin bundles, a thread-like extensions (Fig. 3,B-D). Normally slender and elongated protrusions of F-actin are seen in control HIG82 cells (Fig. 3 A). Upon exposure to cytokines, these become bulky and readily fuse with those from the adjacent cells creating a connection between the cells. These results demonstrated a distinct change in the morphology of synovial cells in response to cytokines like IL-1 and IL-6.Figure 3Fluorescence staining of actin filaments of synoviocyte cells following cytokines treatment. HIG82 cells were grown in culture medium in the absence (panel A) or in the presence of IL-1 (panel B), IL-6 (panel C), or IL-1 plus IL-6 (panel D) for 48 h. Cells on coverslips were fixed, and actin filaments were stained with rhodamine-conjugated phalloidin reagent as described under “Materials and Methods.” Magnification × 1,000.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Cytokine-induced cellular changes significantly altered SAA transcription causing accumulation of this transcript. In an effort to identify the cytokine-response element of SAA promoter, a series of 5′-deletion constructs were prepared (Fig.4 A). These constructs were transiently transfected in rabbit synovial cells, followed by the addition of IL-1 plus IL-6. The results from the transfection assay indicated that deletion of sequences from −314 to −280 has no effect on cytokine-mediated CAT reporter gene induction. In contrast, significant reduction in CAT gene induction was noticed when the region between −280 and −193 was deleted. Further removal of upstream sequences abolished any measurable effect of cytokines. The results of functional promoter analysis suggested that sequences between −280 and −193 were most important for IL-1 plus IL-6 mediated inducible expression of the SAA gene in rabbit synovial cells. Further analysis of the cytokine-inducible region was done by preparing some additional deletion constructs. As shown in Fig. 4 B, a reporter gene containing sequences between −254 and −226 retained full responsiveness to IL-1 plus IL-6 stimulation. Mutation in this region resulted in a loss of responsiveness to cytokine stimulation. These results supported the involvement of sequences between −254 and −226 in the cytokine activation of the SAA gene in synovial cells. To investigate the nuclear factors in cytokine-activated synoviocyte that might interact with the above cytokine-responsive element, we performed DNA binding assays using SAA promoter (−254/−226) and various cytokine-treated synovial cell nuclear extracts. Control, untreated nuclear extract formed three major complexes, termed as c, d, and e (Fig.5 A, lane 1). The same protein amount of nuclear extracts from IL-1, IL-6, and IL-1 plus IL-6-induced cells formed five complexes, a, b,c, d, and e (Fig. 5 A,lanes 2–4). These results showed that cytokines can induce some nuclear proteins that form inducible DNA-protein complexes likea and b with SAA promoter. Noticeably, the levels of a and b were highest in cells treated with IL-1 plus IL-6, whereas the levels of constitutively present complexesc, d, and e remained the same. The specificity of these DNA-protein complexes was determined by competition with a molar excess of unlabeled homologous probe (Fig.5 B, lanes 2, 8, 14, and20) and mutated probe (Fig. 5 B, lanes 3, 9, 15, and 21). Because complex c was not inhibited by the homologous probe, it indicated that this complex was formed by either a nonspecific or a very low affinity interaction of a protein with SAA promoter. Polyclonal antibodies were used to determine the identity of these nuclear proteins. This region of the SAA promoter contains an element where the transcription factor SAF binds. Also a potential Sp1 binding domain is located in this region of the SAA promoter. Antisera to these two transcription factors were used. A complete inhibition of complexesb, d, and e and part inhibition of complex a were obtained using antibody directed against SAF protein (Fig. 5 B, lanes 4, 10,16, and 22). At a higher concentration of the anti-SAF antibody, complex a was also completely inhibited (Fig. 5 C). Anti-Sp1 antibody partially supershifted only complex a (Fig. 5 B, lanes 5,11, 17, and 23) and at a higher concentration, completely supershifted complex a (Fig.5 C). Complete inhibition or supershifting of complexa by anti-SAF or anti-Sp1 antibodies indicate that complexa is formed by a combined interaction of SAF and Sp1 with the SAA probe and not because of a comigration of two independent complexes formed by SAF or Sp1. Also, in a previous study using affinity purified Sp1 protein (23Ray B.K. Ray A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28948-28953Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), we noticed that Sp1 itself does not bind to the SAA promoter. Other three complexes, b,d, and e, are formed by SAF-like proteins. Taken together, these results suggested that activation of SAA promoter after cytokine stimulation is closely related to the induction of both SAF and Sp1 factors, in which the combination of IL-1 and IL-6 had the most stimulatory effect. Noticeably, no DNA-protein complex was detected that was formed by Sp1 alone, indicating that Sp1 cannot directly bind to the SAA promoter. A high level of complex a, which is formed by both SAF and Sp1, potentially could arise because of an increase of DNA binding activities of these two transcription factors or it could be because of only SAF activation. To determine the contribution of Sp1 in the formation of complex a, we assayed the level of Sp1 DNA binding activity in various cell nuclear extracts (Fig. 6). Because the SAA promoter (−254 to −226) is interacted by both SAF and Sp1 proteins, we chose a high-affinity and highly specific Sp1 DNA binding element as a probe for measuring Sp1 activity to avoid any functional interference from SAF proteins present in the nuclear extracts. Moreover, a previous study (23Ray B.K. Ray A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28948-28953Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) indicated that Sp1 does not bind by itself to the SAA promoter. With control nuclear extract, three faint DNA-protein complexes, a, b, and c, in which complex a is major, were detected (lane 1). Cytokine treatment increased the level of complex a with the highest activity seen in IL-1 plus IL-6-treated cells (lanes 2–4). The levels of the other two minor complexes, band c, were only slightly increased during cytokine treatment. The formation of these complexes was completely abolished by the presence of an excess of unlabeled homologous Sp1 oligonucleotide (Fig. 6 B, lanes 2, 7, and12) but not by the presence of unlabeled mutated Sp1 oligonucleotide (Fig. 6 B, lanes 3, 8, and 13). Anti-Sp1 antibody supershifted only complexa (Fig. 6 B, lanes 4, 9, and14), whereas nonspecific antibody had no effect on these complexes (Fig. 6 B, lanes 5, 10, and15). These results showed that complex a is formed by Sp1, and complexes b and c may be formed by any of the other Sp1-like proteins such as Sp2, Sp3, and Sp4 (37Lania L. Majello B. De Luca P. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1997; 29: 1313-1323Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). Thus, Sp1 is highly induced in synoviocyte cells particularly in response to IL-1, and a synergistic induction is achieved by the combined action of IL-1 and IL-6. The increase in SAF and Sp1 DNA binding activities led us to examine their protein levels. Western blot analysis of untreated and various cytokine-treated nuclear extracts with anti-SAF antibody revealed that the level of SAF protein is essentially the same in these four cell extracts (Fig.7 A). However, the protein levels of Sp1 was seen to be appreciably higher in cytokine-treated cells (Fig. 7 B). To ve"

The accompanying paper has described the purification and lipid dependence of both HASs, their preference for cardiolipin, and their stability during storage (Tlapak-Simmons, V. L., Baggenstoss, B. A., Clyne, T., and Weigel, P. H. (1999) J. Biol. Chem. 274, 4239–4245). Kinetic characterization of the enzymes in isolated membranes gave K m values for UDP-GlcUA of 40 ± 4 μm for spHAS and 51 ± 5 μm for seHAS. In both cases, theV max profiles at various concentrations of UDP-GlcNAc were hyperbolic, with no evidence of cooperativity. In contrast, membrane-bound spHAS, but not seHAS, showed sigmoidal behavior as the UDP-GlcNAc concentration was increased, with a Hill number of ∼2, indicating significant cooperativity. The Hill number for UDP-GlcNAc utilization by seHAS was 1, confirming the lack of cooperativity for UDP-GlcNAc in this enzyme. The K mvalues for UDP-GlcNAc were 60 ± 7 μm for seHAS and 149 ± 3 μm for spHAS in the isolated membranes. The kinetic characteristics of the two affinity-purified HAS enzymes were assessed in the presence of cardiolipin after 8–9 days of storage at –80 °C without cardiolipin. With increasing storage time, the enzymes showed a gradual increase in their K mvalues for both substrates and a decrease inV max. Even in the presence of cardiolipin, the detergent-solubilized, purified HASs had substantially higherK m values for both substrates than the membrane-bound enzymes. The K UDP-GlcUA for purified spHAS and seHAS increased 2–4-fold. TheK UDP-GlcNAc for spHAS and seHAS increased 4- and 5-fold, respectively. Despite the higher K mvalues, the V max values for the purified HASs were only ∼50% lower than those for the membrane-bound enzymes. Significantly, purified spHAS displayed the same cooperative interaction with UDP-GlcNAc (n H ∼ 2), whereas purified seHAS showed no cooperativity.

For example, HA forms very viscous solutions and gels due to its high molecular mass and its ability to bind cations and to hydrate large amounts of water. This characteristic of HA provides the viscous lubrication of synovial fluid and helps provide cartilage with its viscoelasticity. These characteristics are also ideal for the role HA has in the extracellular matrices (4Knudson C.B. Knudson W. FASEB J. 1993; 7: 1233-1242Crossref PubMed Scopus (599) Google Scholar, 5Toole B.P.

Science. 1997; 278: 1800-1803Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) from chlorella virus PBCV-1 (A98R) and fromPasteurella multocida (31DeAngelis P.L. Jing W. Drake R.R. Achyuthan A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8454-8458Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Although the two streptococcal HASs are very similar, the HAS from P. multocida is quite different structurally. Similarities among the prokaryotic and eukaryotic members of this HAS family have been reviewed (18Weigel P.H. Hascall V.C. Tammi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13997-14000Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (616) Google Scholar). These various HAS enzymes comprise a large family of proteins with many common features and regions of amino acid sequence identity or similarity.To understand the important role of the HA polysaccharide in normal development and health and in various diseases, it is critical to know more about the HASs, the enzymes responsible for HA synthesis. We need to know how these HASs work to assemble the HA polymer and how the enzymes are regulated. In the accompanying paper (32Tlapak-Simmons V.L. Baggenstoss B.A. Clyne T. Weigel P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4239-4245Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), we reported the purification and lipid dependence of active recombinant spHAS and seHAS expressed in Escherichia coli. In the present study, we have determined, for the first time in the absence of other streptococcal proteins or factors, the kinetic constants for both HAS enzymes in membranes and after detergent solubilization and purification. A preliminary report of these findings was reported earlier (33Tlapak-Simmons V.L. Baggenstoss B.A. Weigel P.H. Glycobiology. 1997; 7: 1032Google Scholar).DISCUSSIONHistorically, the first cell-free studies of HA biosynthesis used Group A streptococcal bacteria. The pioneering work of Dorfman and co-workers (39Markovitz A. Cifonelli J.A. Dorfman A. J. Biol. Chem. 1959; 234: 2343-2350Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 44Stoolmiller A.C. Dorfman A. J. Biol. Chem. 1969; 244: 236-246Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) in the 1950s and 1960s showed that the streptococcal HAS was located in the cell membrane, required Mg2+ ions, and used the two sugar nucleotide substrates UDP-GlcUA and UDP-GlcNAc to polymerize a HA chain. Subsequently, however, these and many other workers were unable to solubilize the enzyme in an active and stable form or to purify it. Similarly, eukaryotic HASs have not yet been purified. Isolation of the Group A and Group C streptococcal HAS genes has now allowed us to express these proteins in large amounts in E. coli (32Tlapak-Simmons V.L. Baggenstoss B.A. Clyne T. Weigel P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4239-4245Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar).All of the known enzymes catalyze reactions that use one or two (or, rarely, three) substrates and produce one or two products. HASs are unique among the enzymes characterized to date. The HAS has two different enzyme activities (i.e. glycosyltransferases) in the same protein, and the HA product after each sugar addition becomes the acceptor for the next sugar addition. HASs are also membrane enzymes. The overall reaction for the synthesis of one HA disaccharide unit is shown in Equation 1, UDP-GlcUA+UDP-GlcNAc+(HA)n→HAS(HA)n+1+2UDPEquation 1 where n is the number of disaccharide units. Although it seems straightforward, the enzyme must possess at least six (and probably seven) different functions to perform this overall reaction, as shown in Fig. 6. Numerous questions about the details and mechanism of this complex reaction can be answered now that the streptococcal HAS enzymes have been purified.HAS enzymes are unique in an additional respect because the two sugar nucleotide substrates are structurally so similar, they each have the possibility of competing with the other for the appropriate UDP-sugar-binding site on the enzyme. This cross-talk hypothesis is illustrated in Fig. 6 by the dashed lines that show, for example, UDP-GlcUA interacting with the UDP-GlcNAc-binding site. Although the HASs do not misincorporate other sugar nucleotides into the growing HA chain, other UDP-sugars may transiently occupy a binding site and thus be competitive inhibitors. Initial experiments have indicated that 0–1 mm concentrations of sugar nucleotides like UDP-Glc or UDP-GalUA or even UDP alone decrease the rate of HA synthesis by spHAS or seHAS. 2K. Kumari, V. L. Tlapak-Simmons, and P. H. Weigel, manuscript in preparation. With high concentrations of one or both of the correct substrates, we observed enzyme inhibition in the presence of a third sugar nucleotide. Even with just the two normal substrates, the rate of HA synthesis becomes biphasic if the concentration of one UDP-sugar is much greater than the other (e.g. Fig. 2 A at a ratio of 100:1). There are no previous reports of this cross-talk phenomenon affecting HA biosynthesis. Observation of this kinetic behavior reflects the advantage of studying purified HAS free from other sugar nucleotide-binding proteins or glycosyltransferases.The scheme in Fig. 6 does not indicate whether sugars are added to the growing HA chain individually or in a coordinated manner as a disaccharide unit as proposed by Saxena et al. (40Saxena I.M. Brown Jr., R.M. Fevre M. Geremia R.A. Henrissat B. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 1419-1424Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) for β-glycosyltransferases predicted to contain two functional domains by hydrophobic cluster analysis. Our present kinetic data for the streptococcal HASs do not allow discrimination between these two models. The model of Saxena et al. (40Saxena I.M. Brown Jr., R.M. Fevre M. Geremia R.A. Henrissat B. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 1419-1424Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) predicts that HA synthesis occurs by addition to the reducing end, as suggested by Prehm (41Prehm P. Biochem. J. 1983; 211: 191-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). However, this model is not consistent with recent reports that HA synthesis (42Asplund T. Brinck J. Suzuke M. Briskin J. Heldin P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1380: 377-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) and Type 3 polysaccharide synthesis, mediated by the related synthase from Streptococcus pneumoniae (43Cartee R.T. Forsee W.T. Yother J.L. Schutzbach J.S. Glycobiology. 1998; 8: 74Google Scholar), occur from the nonreducing end of the growing polysaccharide chains. Definitive answers regarding the direction of polysaccharide chain growth for the HASs and related synthases may require the identification, perhaps utilizing mass spectrometry, of putative UDP-polymer intermediates with the UDP attached at the reducing end.Stoolmiller and Dorfman (44Stoolmiller A.C. Dorfman A. J. Biol. Chem. 1969; 244: 236-246Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) reported the apparentK UDP-GlcUA andK UDP-GlcNAc as 50 μm and 0.5 mm, respectively, in isolated S. pyogenesmembranes. Their UDP-GlcUA kinetic results gave a linear Lineweaver-Burk plot. They noted, however, that the kinetics of UDP-GlcNAc utilization did not behave in the same linear manner when plotted in double-reciprocal form. These investigators were therefore the first to note sigmoidal behavior of spHAS in streptococcal membranes in response to increasing UDP-GlcNAc concentration. van de Rijn and Drake (34van de Rijn I. Drake R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 24302-24306Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) reported, for detergent-solubilized spHAS, values of 39 μm for K UDP-GlcUA and 150 μm for K UDP-GlcNAc, but did not detect a sigmoidal response of the velocity saturation profile when UDP-GlcNAc was varied. They also reported the specific activity of spHAS as 19.4 nmol of UDP-GlcUA/h/mg of extracted membrane protein. We have reported in the accompanying paper (32Tlapak-Simmons V.L. Baggenstoss B.A. Clyne T. Weigel P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4239-4245Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) that the specific activities of purified spHAS and seHAS are 5,500 and 12,000 nmol/h/mg, respectively. These values are consistent with spHAS composing only ∼0.3% of the membrane protein in S. pyogenes cells (17Kumari K. Weigel P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32539-32546Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The addition of bovine CL substantially increased the specific activity of purified spHAS and seHAS, respectively, to 20,000 and 35,000 nmol/h/mg. The catalytic constants for purified spHAS and seHAS in the presence of bovine CL at 30 °C were, respectively, 22 and 36 monosaccharides/s. These values are in close agreement with those reported for seHAS assayed at 37 °C in whole membranes (17Kumari K. Weigel P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32539-32546Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar).The above apparent Michaelis-Menten values for the two substrates were determined using either crude streptococcal membranes or detergent-solubilized membrane extracts, both of which contain other sugar nucleotide-binding proteins and glycosyltransferases and which could contain potential regulatory factors for the HAS enzyme. Here, for the first time, we have characterized the kinetic behavior of purified spHAS and seHAS and these enzymes in membranes containing no other streptococcal proteins. The results demonstrate that then-dodecyl β-d-maltoside-solubilized, purified enzymes behave very similarly to the membrane-bound enzymes. This is an important finding because many studies have reported that HAS activity is irreversibly lost upon solubilization of the protein in a wide variety of nonionic detergents (45Triscott M.X. van de Rijn I. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 6004-6009Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). TheK UDP-GlcUA values for membrane-bound spHAS and seHAS were 40 and 51 μm, respectively. TheK UDP-GlcNAc values for membrane-bound spHAS and seHAS were 149 and 60 μm, respectively.Detergent-solubilized, purified HASs showed essentially the same kinetic characteristics as the membrane-bound enzymes, with the exception of their K m values. TheK UDP-GlcUA values increased ∼4-fold for purified spHAS and seHAS, although the latter enzyme was not saturated even at 1.5 mm. Both enzymes also displayed increasedK m values for UDP-GlcNAc after purification; theK UDP-GlcNAc values increased 4-fold for spHAS and 5-fold for seHAS. We also noted that upon storage at −80 °C in the absence of CL, these enzymes slowly lost activity (t12∼2–3 months), and the biggest change appeared to be in K UDP-GlcNAc, which got progressively larger with time of storage. The stimulation of either HAS by CL is due to a large decrease inK UDP-GlcNAc and an increase inV max (32Tlapak-Simmons V.L. Baggenstoss B.A. Clyne T. Weigel P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4239-4245Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar).Based on our recent findings, the sensitivity of HASs to detergent solubilization can now be explained. Radiation inactivation analysis revealed that the active spHAS and seHAS species are monomers of the HAS protein in complex with ∼16 CL molecules (46Tlapak-Simmons V.L. Kempner E.S. Baggenstoss B.A. Weigel P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26100-26109Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). This conclusion is supported by the results in the accompanying paper (32Tlapak-Simmons V.L. Baggenstoss B.A. Clyne T. Weigel P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4239-4245Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) showing that the activity of affinity-purified HAS, which has been depleted of CL, is very low. The HAS enzymes are highly lipid-dependent and are most effectively stimulated by CL. Preliminary mass spectroscopic analysis indicated that even when purified in the absence of exogenous CL, the enzymes still contain residual associated CL. Therefore, the likely reason for why most detergents inactivate HAS (47Ng K.F. Swartz N.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 11776-11783Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 48Philipson L.H. Schwartz N.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 5017-5023Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 49Prehm P. Mausolf A. Biochem. J. 1986; 235: 887-889Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) is that these detergents displace the CL required for enzyme activity. Even with CL present, most nonionic detergents will compete more efficiently than CL for interaction with the protein. The mild detergentn-dodecyl β-d-maltoside is apparently strong enough to solubilize HAS from membranes, but not so strong that the enzyme is stripped of CL. Identification of n-dodecyl β-d-maltoside as a useful detergent for solubilizing HAS was a substantial contribution (45Triscott M.X. van de Rijn I. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 6004-6009Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Two substantial differences are apparent between the two enzymes. First, the seHAS enzyme is intrinsically about twice as active as spHAS. This was apparent in this and the accompanying study (32Tlapak-Simmons V.L. Baggenstoss B.A. Clyne T. Weigel P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4239-4245Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) with both membrane-bound and purified enzymes and in an earlier study (17Kumari K. Weigel P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32539-32546Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) that examined the rates of HA chain elongation by gel filtration analysis. Since the Group C HA capsule is typically larger than the Group A capsule, this difference could be due to theV max between the two HASs. Second, spHAS, but not seHAS, is complexly regulated by UDP-GlcNAc. The spHAS interaction with this substrate shows a cooperative activation of the enzyme as the UDP-GlcNAc concentration increases. This sigmoidal behavior indicates that spHAS has a second binding site for UDP-GlcNAc that is involved in regulation rather than catalysis. Such allosteric-like regulation is usually observed in enzymes that function as oligomers, not enzymes that are active as a monomeric species such as HAS.For a bacterium to synthesize a HA capsule, three different genes must usually be present. These genes, which encode three different enzymes, are arranged in an operon designated the HA synthesis (orhas) operon (50Crater D.L. van de Rijn I. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18452-18458Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 51DeAngelis P.L. Weigel P.H. Dev. Biol. Stand. 1995; 85: 225-229PubMed Google Scholar). Two of the enzymes are needed for the cell to produce large amounts of the two UDP-sugar precursors, and the third enzyme is HAS, encoded by the gene hasA. UDP-Glc dehydrogenase (whose gene is designated hasB) is required to make UDP-GlcUA from UDP-Glc in an oxidation reaction that utilizes 2 mol of NAD+/mol of UDP-Glc. UDP-Glc pyrophosphorylase (thehasC gene) creates UDP-Glc from UTP and Glc-1-P. Since UDP-Glc is the precursor from which many of the other sugar nucleotides are made, the amount of UDP-Glc produced by a cell will regulate the total amount of all the cell's sugar nucleotides. Bacteria like Group A Streptococcus that make HA capsules usually have two different genes for this pyrophosphorylase enzyme to increase greatly the total amount of cellular sugar nucleotides and thereby to support synthesis of the large amount of HA in the extracellular capsule.If the bacterial cells did not greatly expand their sugar nucleotide pool, the very active HAS would make HA and deplete the cell of UDP-GlcUA and UDP-GlcNAc. Since the latter is also needed for cell wall synthesis, such depletion would stop the cell from growing. This, in fact, occurs when a streptococcal HAS gene is expressed in another bacterial species that produces the two substrates, but lacks the additional enzyme (hasC) needed to enlarge the sugar nucleotide pools (14DeAngelis P.L. Papaconstantinou J. Weigel P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14568-14571Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15DeAngelis P.L. Papaconstantinou J. Weigel P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19181-19184Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16DeAngelis P.L. Weigel P.H. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 9033-9039Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). These cells do not grow well.The cooperative kinetic response of spHAS to UDP-GlcNAc may reflect an evolutionary adaptation by Group A Streptococcus to ensure that cell growth is not impaired by the production of the HA capsule. Because spHAS activity responds to changes in UDP-GlcNAc concentration in a sigmoidal manner, the enzyme cannot attain itsV max until this concentration is very high. This kinetic regulation of spHAS may ensure that cell wall synthesis does not compete with capsule production for UDP-GlcNAc. It is unclear why the seHAS enzyme is not similarly regulated by UDP-GlcNAc or if this lack of regulation is, in fact, a reason why Group A organisms are more pathogenic in humans than Group C strains. Availability of purified streptococcal HASs will facilitate future studies on their role in bacterial virulence and the mechanisms by which these enzymes perform the multiple functions required for HA biosynthesis.

Although the structure of HA seems quite simple, the molecule, nonetheless, has unusual physical properties that are important for its numerous biological functions (2Evered D. Whelan J. CIBA Found.

For example, HA forms very viscous solutions and gels due to its high molecular mass and its ability to bind cations and to hydrate large amounts of water. This characteristic of HA provides the viscous lubrication of synovial fluid and helps provide cartilage with its viscoelasticity. These characteristics are also ideal for the role HA has in the extracellular matrices (4Knudson C.B. Knudson W. FASEB J. 1993; 7: 1233-1242Crossref PubMed Scopus (599) Google Scholar, 5Toole B.P.

Here, we have uncovered the involvement of clusterin, the function(s) of which is still poorly understood, in this complex process. As revealed by molecular cloning, chicken clusterin is a 428-residue protein that migrates at 70 kDa on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and possesses most of the structural features of its mammalian successors. However, in contrast to mammalian clusterin, the chicken protein appears not to be cleaved intracellularly into a disulfide-linked heterodimer; possibly as a consequence thereof, it is not secreted constitutively and is absent from the circulation, where most of clusterin is found in mammals. In the ovary, clusterin is a major product of the somatic granulosa cells, in a pattern correlating with the developmental phases of individual follicles. In that, transcript levels are high not only at onset of vitellogenesis, but also in atretic follicles and in the postovulatory follicle sac,i.e. in situations characterized by apoptotic events. Yolk of growing oocytes contains a 43-kDa truncated form of clusterin that does not appear to be synthesized within the oocyte. Rather, we here show for the first time that 70-kDa clusterin interacts not only with megalin, but also with two chicken oocyte-specific members of the low density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) gene family. These receptors, termed LDLR-related protein with eight ligand binding repeats (LR8) and LDLR-related protein (380 kDa), likely internalize granulosa cell-derived 70-kDa clusterin, which may subsequently be processed to the 43-kDa product. Thus, chicken clusterin could serve as a marker for follicular atresia and resorption, and, based on its ability to bind several other proteins, it may serve as carrier for the receptor-mediated endocytosis into oocytes of components important for embryonic development, two hitherto unknown functions of this intriguing protein.

Commun. 1987; 147: 196-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). Clusterin is obviously identical to the protein(s) previously characterized as apolipoprotein J, sulfated glycoprotein-2, serum protein 40-40, and testosterone repressed prostate message-2. In the present work, we use the term clusterin when referring to this protein. Most recently, in addition to the well characterized, secreted form of the protein, a shorter variant of human clusterin lacking the first 32 amino-terminal residues, including the hydrophobic signal peptide, has been reported (11Reddy K.B. Jin G. Karode M.C. Harmony J.A.K. Howe P.H. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 6157-6163Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). This truncated form, produced in response to treatment with transforming growth factor β, is retained intracellularly and targeted to the nucleus via an SV40-like nuclear localization sequence, which is silent in the full-length protein. The biological significance for such a transforming growth factor β-induced nuclear localization is presently unclear. Despite its purported function(s) in numerous physiological and pathophysiological processes, the sites and mechanisms of action of clusterin remain elusive. To date, the only receptor known to bind and internalize clusterin is megalin/gp330, a member of the low density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) 1The abbreviations used are: LDLR, low density lipoprotein receptor; LDL, low density lipoprotein; VLDL, very low density lipoprotein; VTG, vitellogenin; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; LR8, LDLR-related protein with eight ligand binding repeats; LRP380, LDLR-related protein, 380 kDa; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; GST, glutathioneS-transferase; LRP, LDL receptor-related protein.family (12Kounnas M.Z.

Thus, based on our previous work describing LDLR family members in the chicken (17Bujo H. Hermann M. Kaderli M.O. Jacobsen L. Sugawara S. Nimpf J. Yamamoto T. Schneider W.J.

Mahon M.G. Nimpf J. Schneider W.J. DNA Cell Biol. 1997; 16: 35-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), we have become interested in the biology of clusterin in this species. All presently known receptors belonging to the LDLR gene family are represented in this avian model (19Schneider W.J. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 1995; 6: 92-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 21Schneider W.J. Nimpf J. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 1993; 4: 205-209Crossref Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 22Schneider W.J. Nimpf J. Bujo H. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 1997; 8: 315-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), allowing a thorough investigation into their possible roles in clusterin metabolism. As a first step in this direction, we now have molecularly characterized chicken clusterin, and we provide insights into its involvement in the growth and development of chicken oocytes within ovarian follicles. A 180-base pair PCR fragment was produced by reverse transcription-PCR (Life Technologies, Inc.) using chicken testes poly(A)+ RNA for first-strand cDNA synthesis and two synthetic oligonucleotides corresponding to quail clusterin cDNA (originally reported as T64 (23Michel D. Gilet G. Pessac B. Calothy G. Brun G. Oncogene Res. 1989; 4: 127-136PubMed Google Scholar)): 5′-GTG GGA GGA GTG CAA GCC CTG CC-3′ and 5′-TGC CGC TGC TCC CGA TCC AGC AG-3′. The fragment was subcloned, and its sequence was found to be 98 and 73% identical to quail and human clusterin, respectively. The fragment was32P-labeled using the Megaprime DNA labeling kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and used as probe to screen a random hexamer-primed chicken brain λgt11 cDNA library (CLONTECH). Hybridization conditions were as follows: 5× NET (500 mmNaCl, 75 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 5 mm EDTA), 5× Denhardt's solution (0.1% Ficoll, 0.1% polyvinylpyrrolidone, 0.1% bovine serum albumin), 0.2% SDS and 100 μg/ml salmon sperm DNA for 20 h at 65 °C. The membranes were washed twice for 30 min each time in 2× NET containing 0.2% SDS at 65 °C. Positive clones were amplified by PCR using λgt11-specific primers, subcloned into the pGEM-T (Promega) vector, and sequenced on both strands (Sequenase). The complete open reading frame of chicken clusterin was obtained by ligating two overlapping clones using their common SacI restriction site. Comparison of the 180-base pair PCR product used as probe with the corresponding region in the cDNA clone revealed differences in two positions. For Northern blot analysis, total RNA prepared from various tissues of male and female chickens was denatured using glyoxal and dimethyl sulfoxide, separated by electrophoresis on a 1.2% agarose gel, and blotted onto Hybond N+ nylon membrane (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) using standard methods (24Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The above-described 180-base pair chicken clusterin cDNA fragment was labeled with 32P using the Megaprime DNA labeling kit and used as probe. The membrane was hybridized overnight at 65 °C in a solution containing 10 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 70 mg/ml SDS, 0.5 m sodium phosphate buffer, pH 6.8, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, and the32P-labeled DNA probe. Washing was performed at 65 °C in 5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 50 mg/ml SDS, 40 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 6.8, and 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, and then in 10 mg/ml SDS, 40 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 6.8, and 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0. The Hybond filter was exposed to ReflectionTM film (NEN Life Science Products) with intensifying screens at −80 °C. The relative amounts of RNA loaded were estimated using methylene blue staining of ribosomal RNA. Tissue sections from ovarian follicles (small yellow, 5–6 mm in diameter) were prepared forin situ hybridization as described earlier (25Bujo H. Lindstedt K.A. Hermann M. Dalmau L.M. Nimpf J. Schneider W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23546-23551Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 26Lindstedt K.A. Mahon M.G. Foisner R. Hermann M. Nimpf J. Schneider W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30221-30227Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The sections (8 μm) were hybridized overnight at 45 °C with prehybridization solution containing 10% dextran sulfate and ∼300 pg/μl of the digoxigenin-labeled antisense or sense RNA probes. The RNA probes were prepared as follows: a 180-base pair PCR fragment (Fig.1, nucleotides 333–512), prepared from the chicken clusterin cDNA by PCR amplification using the primers 5′-GTG GGA GGA GTG CAA GCC CTG CC-3′ (sense) and 5′-TGC CGC TGC TCC CGA TCC AGC AG-3′ (antisense), was subcloned into the pGEM-T vector (Promega). The purified plasmid was linearized, and the RNA probe prepared and labeled with digoxigenin-UTP by in vitro transcription with SP6 and T7 RNA polymerase (digoxigenin RNA labeling kit (SP6/T7)) according to the manufacturer's recommendations (Boehringer Mannheim). The slides were then washed three times for 10 min each time with 0.2× SSC and twice for 10 min each time with 0.1× SSC at 50 °C. After washing, slides were prepared for immunodetection by incubating them in 150 mm NaCl, 100 mm Tris, pH 7.5 (Buffer A), containing 3% normal goat serum and 1% bovine serum albumin for 30 min at 23 °C. The sections were then exposed to anti-digoxigenin-AP Fab fragments (1:500 dilution, Boehringer Mannheim) in the same buffer for 2 h at room temperature and extensively washed with Buffer A and then with Buffer B (100 mm NaCl, 100 mmTris, pH 9.5, and 50 mm MgCl2). The bound antibody was detected by incubating the slides overnight with a precipitating BM purple AP substrate (Boehringer Mannheim). The reaction was stopped by incubating the slides in 10 mmTris, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, and mounting them in Aquamount (BDH, Poole, United Kingdom). Photographs were taken with a Zeiss Axiovert 10 light microscope. Antiserum against chicken clusterin was prepared against two synthetic peptides corresponding to an amino-terminal (antibody A; residues 106–120 in Fig. 1, HSGSGLVGRQLEELL) or a carboxyl-terminal (antibody B; residues 395–410 in Fig. 1, SLTVPGDISWDDPRFM) region of the protein. The peptides were coupled to keyhole limpet hemocyanin and used for immunization of two adult female New Zealand White rabbits. For the first injection (day 0), the antigens were mixed with Freund's complete adjuvant and for successive booster injections thereafter (days 21 and 28) with Freund's incomplete adjuvant (27Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988Google Scholar). Antibodies against LR8 (28Stifani S. Barber D.L. Aebersold R. Steyrer E. Shen X.

Yamamoto T. Schneider W.J. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5165-5175Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar) are described in the indicated references. For preparation of Triton X-100 extracts from chicken tissues, freshly obtained samples were placed in ice-cold solubilization buffer (4 ml/g of wet weight) containing 200 mm Tris-maleate, pH 6.5, 2 mmCaCl2, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2.5 μm leupeptin, and 1% Triton X-100 and homogenized with an Ultra Turrax T25 homogenizer at medium setting for 30 s, and then at high setting for a further 30 s. The extraction mixture was kept on ice for 15 min and then centrifuged at 300,000 × g for 40 min at 4 °C. The resulting supernatant was stored at −20 °C in aliquots until used. Protein concentrations were determined by the Bio-Rad Protein Assay (Bio-Rad). For preparation of Triton X-100 extracts of chicken ovarian follicles, the follicles were first punctured, and the majority of the yolk portion was carefully squeezed out, followed by a short wash in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), pH 7.4. The remaining follicle tissue was then processed as above. Triton X-100 extracts from membrane fractions of chicken tissues were prepared as described previously (28Stifani S. Barber D.L. Aebersold R. Steyrer E. Shen X. Nimpf J. Schneider W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19079-19087Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). One-dimensional, 4.5–18% gradient SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) was performed according to Laemmli (29Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207233) Google Scholar) using a minigel system (Bio-Rad, Mini-ProteanTM II slab cell). Samples were prepared either in the absence (nonreducing conditions) or the presence (reducing conditions) of 10 mm dithiothreitol with heating. Electrophoresis was performed at 180 V for 1 h with the inclusion of broad range M r standards (Bio-Rad). Electrophoretic transfer of the proteins to nitrocellulose membrane (Hybond-C, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was performed in transfer buffer (26 mm Tris, 192 mm glycine, 20% methanol) for 1 h at 200 mA, on ice, using the Bio-Rad Mini Transblot system. The transfer was verified by staining the nitrocellulose membrane with 0.2% Ponceau S in 3% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid and destaining in water. Western blotting was performed using specific rabbit antisera at the concentrations indicated in the figure legends, followed by protein A-horseradish peroxidase (Sigma, 1:5000) and the chemiluminescence detection method (ECL system, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). A full-length clusterin cDNA was prepared by ligating the two overlapping clones obtained from screening the brain λgt11 cDNA library at their common SacI restriction site. The ligated fragment was PCR-amplified using Pfu DNA polymerase (Stratagene) and specific 5′- and 3′-end chicken clusterin oligonucleotides, and subcloned via blunt-end ligation into pCR-ScriptTM SK(+) (Stratagene). The identity of the PCR-generated fragment was verified by sequencing. The obtained full-length clusterin cDNA was then directionally cloned in-frame into a pGEX-5X-1 expression vector (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) followed by transfection of Escherichia coli XL1 Blue subcloning-grade competent cells (Stratagene). The GST fusion protein was induced by incubating the cells in the presence of 0.1 mm isopropylthio-β-d-galactoside and purified according to the method described by Frangioni and Neel (30Frangioni J.V. Neel B.G. Anal. Biochem. 1993; 210: 179-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (832) Google Scholar). Nitrocellulose strips containing SDS-PAGE-separated oocyte membrane proteins were blocked for 1 h in TBS (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 137 mm NaCl, and 2 mm CaCl2) plus 5% skim milk and 0.1% Tween (blocking buffer). Strips were then incubated for 1 h in the same buffer with or without purified GST-clusterin fusion protein at the concentrations indicated in the figure legends. The strips were washed three times for 20 min each time with TBS containing 0.1% Tween and 2 mm CaCl2 (washing buffer) and then incubated for 1 h in blocking buffer containing either anti-chicken clusterin antiserum, anti-chicken LR8 antiserum, or anti-chicken LRP380 antiserum at the concentrations indicated in the figure legends. After three 20-min washes, the bound antibodies were detected with protein A-horseradish peroxidase (1:5000) using the chemiluminescence detection method. Chicken follicles (small yellow, 5–6 mm in diameter) were fixed overnight with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS, pH 7.4, at 4 °C. Following three successive washes with PBS, the follicles were treated with increasing concentrations of ethanol (50–100%), and then, within a series of five steps, the ethanol was replaced by 100% xylol. The xylol was further substituted for paraffin in two steps at 50 °C, followed by three additional 20-min incubations in paraffin. Tissues were then transferred to plastic moulds and embedded in paraffin. Tissue sections of 6 μm were cut on a Microtome and transferred onto glass slides that had been pretreated with 2% 3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane, followed by heat treatment for 16 h at 60 °C. For immunohistochemistry, the tissue sections were deparaffinized by soaking in xylol two times for 10 min each, followed by treatment with decreasing concentrations of ethanol and a final 5-min incubation in 3% H2O2. The sections were incubated in PBS containing 1% nonfat powdered milk and 3% goat serum (blocking buffer) for 1 h at room temperature. Following five washes with PBS for 1 min each, the sections were incubated in blocking buffer containing either primary antiserum against chicken clusterin, LR8, LRP380, or their corresponding preimmune sera (at the concentrations indicated in the figure legends) and incubated for 16 h at 4 °C in a humid chamber. After being washed five times with PBS, follicle sections were incubated with biotinylated goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:500) in blocking buffer for 1 h at 23 °C. Slides were subsequently washed five times in PBS and incubated with avidin-horseradish peroxidase (1:200) in blocking buffer without goat serum for 1 h at 23 °C. Following extensive washing in PBS, the sections were incubated in 0.1 m sodium acetate buffer, pH 5.2, containing 0.03% H2O2and 0.2 mg/ml 3-amino-9-ethylcarbazole (stock solution: 4 mg/ml in N,N-dimethylformamide). The color reaction was followed under a microscope and terminated by incubating the slides in water. The stained sections were mounted in Aquamount (BDH), and photographs were taken with a Zeiss Axiovert 10 light microscope. A full-length chicken clusterin cDNA was isolated from a brain λgt11 cDNA library by homology screening. The deduced nucleotide sequence revealed an open reading frame of 1344 nucleotides, encoding a protein of 448 amino acids (Fig. 1). The first translation initiation codon (ATG) is located in a context (ACCATGG) that precisely conforms with the consensus sequence predicted by the compilation of animal initiation start sites (31Kozak M. Cell. 1986; 44: 283-292Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3590) Google Scholar, 32Lütcke H.A. Chow K.C. Mickell F.S. Moss K.A. Kern H.F. Scheele G.A. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 43-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (871) Google Scholar). At the nucleotide level, chicken clusterin shows 61 and 94% identity to human and quail clusterin, respectively. According to our calculations based on the criteria defined by von Heijne (33von Heijne G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1983; 133: 17-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (1607) Google Scholar), chicken clusterin has a putative signal sequence consisting of 20 amino acids (Fig. 1,boxed), generating an amino-terminal leucine in the mature protein. In reviewing the literature, we noticed that previously, the amino terminus of quail clusterin, identical in that region to chicken clusterin, had been proposed as the glycine 4 residues upstream of this leucine (23Michel D. Gilet G. Pessac B. Calothy G. Brun G. Oncogene Res. 1989; 4: 127-136PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 2). Our calculations confirmed, however, the previously reported amino terminus of mature human clusterin (Fig. 2). The predicted mature chicken clusterin polypeptide (428 amino acids) has a calculatedM r of 50,157 and shows 45 and 95% identity to human and quail clusterin, respectively (Fig. 2). All 10 cysteine residues are conserved in the three species (Figs. 1 and 2, black squares), as well as four of the seven consensus sequences for potential N-linked glycosylation in the human protein (Fig.1, thin underlines) (7de Silva H.V. Harmony J.A.K. Stuart W.D. Gil C.M. Robbins J. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 5380-5389Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). Chicken clusterin has two additional consensus sequences for N-linked glycosylation that are absent in human clusterin but conserved in quail clusterin (Fig. 1, bold underlines). The four predicted potential heparin binding sites in human clusterin (7de Silva H.V. Harmony J.A.K. Stuart W.D. Gil C.M. Robbins J. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 5380-5389Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar) appear not to be strictly conserved in chicken (Fig. 2, light hatched boxes). However, a potential nuclear localization signal (Fig. 2, dark hatched box), present in human clusterin (LEEAKKKK) and proposed to target a truncated form of the protein to the nucleus (11Reddy K.B. Jin G. Karode M.C. Harmony J.A.K. Howe P.H. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 6157-6163Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar), is also present in the chicken protein (LEETKRRK), as well as several potential in-frame translation initiation sites (corresponding to codons 52, 56, and 66 in the avian precursor protein; Fig. 2). In order to visualize the chicken protein, we performed immunoblotting of detergent extracts prepared from various tissues, as well as of serum, with rabbit antiserum raised against a synthetic peptide derived from the predicted amino-terminal half of chicken clusterin (antibody A; cf. under “Experimental Procedures”) (Fig.3). The commonly observed immunoreactive band in all tissues was a ∼70-kDa protein. Furthermore, in certain tissues (Fig. 3 A), various additional bands were visualized, the identity of which remains unclear. The 70-kDa protein did not change migration when the samples were analyzed under reducing conditions (not shown, but cf. Fig. 8); thus, we conclude that the major 70-kDa protein represents chicken clusterin. Most significantly, chicken serum was devoid of clusterin, in contrast to the situation in mammals, in which clusterin is prominent in the blood compartment (1de Silva H.V. Stuart W.D. Duvic C.R. Wetterau J.R. Ray M.J. Ferguson D.G. Albers H.W. Smith W.R. Harmony J.A.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 13240-13247Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (in Fig. 3 A, the ∼150-kDa protein in serum represents chicken IgG, which cross-reacts, albeit weakly, with the protein A used to detect the bound rabbit antibody). In experiments not shown, we subjected isolated high density lipoprotein fractions (the major clusterin-harboring serum fraction in mammals) from both hens and roosters to the same analysis, but could not detect clusterin there either. Also surprisingly, hepatic levels of the protein were very low compared with those found in mammalian species (34Aronow B.J. Lund S.D. Brown T.L. Harmony J.A.K. Witte D.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 725-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). However, levels of clusterin were significant in brain, heart, kidney, muscle and gonadal tissues. Furthermore, in contrast to reports at the RNA level in mammals (6Jordan-Starck T.C. Witte D.P. Aronow B.J. Harmony J.A.K. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 1992; 3: 75-85Crossref Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 7de Silva H.V. Harmony J.A.K. Stuart W.D. Gil C.M. Robbins J.

Clusterin was also present in the uropygial and adrenal glands.Figure 8Identification of clusterin receptors by ligand blotting. Nitrocellulose strips containing SDS-PAGE-separated oocyte membrane proteins (∼25 μg/lane) were incubated in the presence (lane 2, 10 μg/ml; lanes 3–5, 40 μg/ml) or absence (lanes 1 and 6) of chicken GST-clusterin fusion protein.

https://openalex.org/W2163269684,"A strain of the cyanobacteriumSynechococcus elongatus was generated that expresses a hybrid version of the photosystem I subunit PsaF consisting of the first 83 amino acids of PsaF from the green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii fused to the C-terminal portion of PsaF from S. elongatus. The corresponding modified gene was introduced into the genome of the psaF-deletion strain FK2 by cointegration with an antibiotic resistance gene. The transformants express a new PsaF subunit similar in size to PsaF from C. reinhardtiithat is assembled into photosystem I (PSI). Hybrid PSI complexes isolated from these strains show an increase by 2 or 3 orders of magnitude in the rate of P700+ reduction by C. reinhardtii cytochrome c 6 or plastocyanin in 30% of the complexes as compared with wild type cyanobacterial PSI. The corresponding optimum second-order rate constants (k 2 = 4.0 and 1.7 × 107m1 s1 for cytochromec 6 and plastocyanin) are similar to those of PSI from C. reinhardtii. The remaining complexes are reduced at a slow rate similar to that observed with wild type PSI fromS. elongatus and the algal donors. At high concentrations of C. reinhardtii cytochrome c 6, a fast first-order kinetic component (t12=4 μs) is revealed, indicative of intramolecular electron transfer within a complex between the hybrid PSI and cytochromec 6. This first-order phase is characteristic for P700+ reduction by cytochromec 6 or plastocyanin in algae and higher plants. However, a similar fast phase is not detected for plastocyanin. Cross-linking studies show that, in contrast to PSI from wild typeS. elongatus, the chimeric PsaF of PSI from the transformed strain cross-links to cytochrome c 6 or plastocyanin with a similar efficiency as PsaF from C. reinhardtii PSI. Our data indicate that development of a eukaryotic type of reaction mechanism for binding and electron transfer between PSI and its electron donors required structural changes in both PSI and cytochrome c 6 or plastocyanin. A strain of the cyanobacteriumSynechococcus elongatus was generated that expresses a hybrid version of the photosystem I subunit PsaF consisting of the first 83 amino acids of PsaF from the green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii fused to the C-terminal portion of PsaF from S. elongatus. The corresponding modified gene was introduced into the genome of the psaF-deletion strain FK2 by cointegration with an antibiotic resistance gene. The transformants express a new PsaF subunit similar in size to PsaF from C. reinhardtiithat is assembled into photosystem I (PSI). Hybrid PSI complexes isolated from these strains show an increase by 2 or 3 orders of magnitude in the rate of P700+ reduction by C. reinhardtii cytochrome c 6 or plastocyanin in 30% of the complexes as compared with wild type cyanobacterial PSI. The corresponding optimum second-order rate constants (k 2 = 4.0 and 1.7 × 107m1 s1 for cytochromec 6 and plastocyanin) are similar to those of PSI from C. reinhardtii. The remaining complexes are reduced at a slow rate similar to that observed with wild type PSI fromS. elongatus and the algal donors. At high concentrations of C. reinhardtii cytochrome c 6, a fast first-order kinetic component (t12=4 μs) is revealed, indicative of intramolecular electron transfer within a complex between the hybrid PSI and cytochromec 6. This first-order phase is characteristic for P700+ reduction by cytochromec 6 or plastocyanin in algae and higher plants. However, a similar fast phase is not detected for plastocyanin. Cross-linking studies show that, in contrast to PSI from wild typeS. elongatus, the chimeric PsaF of PSI from the transformed strain cross-links to cytochrome c 6 or plastocyanin with a similar efficiency as PsaF from C. reinhardtii PSI. Our data indicate that development of a eukaryotic type of reaction mechanism for binding and electron transfer between PSI and its electron donors required structural changes in both PSI and cytochrome c 6 or plastocyanin. One of several minor differences found in the otherwise remarkably conserved electron transfer chains of oxygenic photosynthesis of cyanobacteria, algae, and land plants concerns the type of electron carrier proteins used to transfer electrons from the cytochromeb 6 /f complex to photosystem I and the way they interact with PSI 1The abbreviations used are: PSI, photosystem I; cyt c 6, cytochrome c 6; Pc, plastocyanin; PsaF, subunit III of photosystem I; psaF , gene of the PsaF subunit; P700, primary donor of photosystem I; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; Mops, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid; kb, kilobase pairs.

Ki Ho K. Bryant D.A. The Molecular Biology of Cyanobacteria. Kluwer Academic Publishers Group, Drodrecht, Netherlands1994: 381-407Crossref Google Scholar). All cyanobacteria investigated utilize a cytochromec 6 as a soluble periplasmic electron carrier. In several cases, e.g. Synechococcus elongatus,cytochrome c 6 is the only electron carrier in the periplasma and is constitutively expressed (1Reith M. Ort D.R. Yocum C.F. Oxygenic Photosynthesis: The Light Reactions. Kluwer Academic Publishers Group, Drodrecht, Netherlands1996: 643-657Google Scholar, 2Morand L.Z. Cheng R.H. Krogman D.W. Ki Ho K. Bryant D.A.

PCC 6803 and most algae examined, however, use both cytochrome c 6 and the copper-containing plastocyanin as alternative periplasmic electron carrier proteins (4Sandman G. Böger P. Plant Sci. Lett. 1980; 17: 417-424Crossref Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 5Ho K.K. Krogmann D.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1984; 766: 310-316Crossref Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 6Merchant S. Bogorad L. Mol. Cell.

Yamagishi M. Yoshizaki F. Sugimura Y. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1992; 111: 219-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). In these organisms, they are differentially expressed depending mostly on the relative availability of copper and iron in the culture medium (5Ho K.K. Krogmann D.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1984; 766: 310-316Crossref Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 8Nakamura M. Yamagishi M. Yoshizaki F. Sugimura Y. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1992; 111: 219-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). In contrast, plastocyanin is expressed constitutively in photosynthetic land plants that lack cytochromec 6. Thus, in the evolution of oxygen-evolving organisms a tendency to replace the originally used c-type cytochrome by plastocyanin is clearly discernible. The PSI complex functions as a light-driven oxidoreductase that transfers electrons from cytochrome c 6 or plastocyanin to ferredoxin or flavodoxin (see Refs. 9Golbeck J.H. Bryant D.A. The Molecular Biology of Cyanobacteria. Kluwer Academic Publishers Group, Drodrecht, Netherlands1994: 319-360Crossref Google Scholar and 10Nechushtai R. Eden A. Cohen Y. Klein J. Ort D.R. Yocum C.F. Advances in Photosynthesis, Oxygenic Photosynthesis: The Light Reactions. Kluwer Academic Publishers Group, Drodrecht, Netherlands1996: 289-311Google Scholar for a review). According to the established atomic structure of PSI fromS. elongatus, the primary donor of PSI, P700, is located within the highly conserved reaction center core close to the periplasmic surface of the photosynthetic membrane (9Golbeck J.H. Bryant D.A. The Molecular Biology of Cyanobacteria. Kluwer Academic Publishers Group, Drodrecht, Netherlands1994: 319-360Crossref Google Scholar, 11Krauss N. Schubert W.D. Klukas O. Fromme P.

Biol. 1997; 272: 741-769Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). Two horizontal helixes l and l′, attributed to the PSI core subunits PsaA and PsaB, are thought to form a recognition site for binding of the periplasmic electron carriers (11Krauss N. Schubert W.D. Klukas O. Fromme P. Witt H.T. Saenger W. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 965-973Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar, 12Schubert W.D. Klukas O. Krauss N. Saenger W. Fromme P. Witt H.T. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 272: 741-769Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). However, despite the high degree of structural conservation of the PSI core subunits in all oxygen-evolving organisms, the mechanism of interaction between plastocyanin or cytochrome and PSI varies in different species. In higher plants, electron transfer from plastocyanin to P700+ is a biphasic process that includes a first-order kinetic component with a half-life of about 12 μs which is attributed to electron transfer from plastocyanin to P700+ within a stable complex between plastocyanin and PSI formed prior to the photooxidation of P700 (13Bottin H. Mathis P. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 6453-6460Crossref Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 14Haehnel W. Ratajczak R. Robenek H. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 1397-1405Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 15Drepper F. Hippler M. Nitschke W. Haehnel W. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 1282-1295Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Biochemical studies indicate that the PsaF subunit of PSI is involved in the formation of this complex (16Wynn R.M. Malkin R. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 5863-5869Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 17Hippler M. Ratajczak R. Haehnel W. FEBS Lett. 1989; 250: 280-284Crossref Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 18Bengis C. Nelson N. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 4564-4569Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Similar first-order kinetic components with half-lives of about 3 μs are observed for the reduction of P700+ by both plastocyanin and cytochrome c 6 in the green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii (19Hippler M. Drepper F. Farah J. Rochaix J.-D. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 6343-6349Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Electron transfer from both donors to PSI from a psaF-deficient mutant of C. reinhardtii was shown to be drastically slower indicating that PsaF is essential for efficient electron transfer from both plastocyanin and cytochrome c 6 to PSI (19Hippler M. Drepper F. Farah J. Rochaix J.-D. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 6343-6349Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 20Farah J. Rappaport F. Choquet Y. Joliot P. Rochaix J.-D. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4976-4984Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Similar first-order kinetics have also been observed for PSI reduction by plastocyanin or cytochrome c in the green algaeChlorella and Monoraphidium braunii (21Delosme R. Photosynth. Res. 1991; 29: 45-54PubMed Google Scholar, 22Diaz A. Hervás M. Navarro J.A. De la Rosa M.A. Tollin G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 222: 1001-1007Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). This suggests that the formation of complexes between PSI and these electron donors which involve the PsaF subunit is likely to occur generally in algae and plants. In contrast, in the cyanobacteriumSynechocystis sp. PCC 6803, the reduction of P700+ by cytochrome c 6 or plastocyanin is a second-order process and fast phases which can be attributed to electron transfer within a stable preformed complex could not be detected (3Hatakana H. Sonoike K. Hirano M. Katoh S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1141: 45-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 23Hervás M. Ortega J.M. Navarro J.A. De la Rosa M.A. Bottin H. Biochim. Biophys.

Chem. 1994; 269: 3205-3211Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, spectroscopic investigations of PSI complexes from S. elongatus andSynechocystis sp. PCC 6803 lacking the PsaF subunit show that the absence of PsaF does not affect the rates of P700+reduction by cytochrome c 6 (3Hatakana H. Sonoike K. Hirano M. Katoh S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1141: 45-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 25Xu Q. Xu L. Chitnis V. Chitnis P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3205-3211Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It has been shown that the PsaF subunit of PSI from spinach cross-links at one of its N-terminal lysines between residues 10–23 or 24–51 to the conserved acidic amino acids 42–44 and 59–61 of plastocyanin, respectively (26Hippler M. Reichert J. Sutter M. Zak E. Altschmied L. Schröer U. Herrmann R.G. Haehnel W. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6374-6384Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). This region close to the N-terminal end of PsaF could form an amphipathic α-helix, whose positively charged face may interact with plastocyanin (26Hippler M. Reichert J. Sutter M. Zak E. Altschmied L. Schröer U. Herrmann R.G. Haehnel W. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6374-6384Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Amino acid sequence comparison, however, shows that a 27-amino acid domain of this well conserved N terminus of PsaF from plants and algae is missing in cyanobacteria (9Golbeck J.H. Bryant D.A. The Molecular Biology of Cyanobacteria. Kluwer Academic Publishers Group, Drodrecht, Netherlands1994: 319-360Crossref Google Scholar,27Chitnis P.R. Purvis D. Nelson N. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 20146-20151Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It was therefore suggested that the introduction of this new N-terminal domain into algal and plant-type PsaF may be responsible for the formation of the complex between PSI and cytochromec 6 or plastocyanin that is characteristic for PSI from algae and plants (26Hippler M. Reichert J. Sutter M. Zak E. Altschmied L. Schröer U. Herrmann R.G. Haehnel W. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6374-6384Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). In order to test this hypothesis we have introduced a chimeric psaF gene containing the N-terminal coding region from the green alga C. reinhardtiiinto the genome of a psaF-deletion strain of S. elongatus and report the functional characterization of a cyanobacterial photosystem I complex carrying an algal type PsaF subunit. DNA manipulations were performed in Escherichia coli strain XL1 blue according to standard protocols (28Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Integrative cartridge vectors were constructed by modifications of a genomic 2.45-kb BamHI/XhoI fragment from S. elongatus carrying the psaF/psaJ operon subcloned into pBSC M13+ (29Mühlenhoff U. Haehnel W. Witt H.T. Herrmann R.G. Gene (Amst.). 1993; 127: 71-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). A DNA construct, pCRSEF/2, was constructed in which the region of the psaF gene fromS. elongatus encoding the mature PsaF subunit was substituted completely by the psaF region from C. reinhardtii (30Franzén L.G. Frank G. Zuber H. Rochaix J.D. Plant Mol. Biol. 1989; 12: 463-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). First, an EcoRV site was introduced at codons 24 and 25 of psaF (i.e. codons 1 and 2 of the mature PsaF from S. elongatus), and the termination codon was modified to create an XbaI site. These modifications were introduced by inverse PCR in the presence of oligonucleotides SEF1 (5′-TGCGATATCAGCGGAGGCTAGG-3′) and SEF2 (5′-TCTCTAGATTTGCTGTTTGTTG-3′) to create the vector pSEF1. Second, apsaF cDNA clone from C. reinhardtii (30Franzén L.G. Frank G. Zuber H. Rochaix J.D. Plant Mol. Biol. 1989; 12: 463-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) was modified by PCR in the presence of oligonucleotides CRF1 (5′-CCGATATCGCGGGCCTGACC-3′) and CRF2 (5′-CAGCTAGCGGGGAGACACGG-3′) to create an EcoRV site at codons 63 and 64 (i.e.codons 1 and 2 of the mature PsaF) and an NheI site at the termination codon. This fragment was inserted into the EcoRV and XbaI sites of pSEF1 to produce the plasmid pCRSEF/2 which carries the psaF/psaJ operon from S. elongatus in which the part of the C. reinhardtii psaFgene encoding the entire mature PsaF is fused in frame to the presequence of psaF from S. elongatus. In addition, a second plasmid was constructed in which the codons for amino acids Ile64 to His145 of PsaF from C. reinhardtii were inserted in frame between codon Asp24 and codon Ala83 ofpsaF from S. elongatus. First, the genomicClaI/XhoI fragment from S. elongatuswas modified to create a BalI site at codons 81 and 82 by PCR in the presence of oligonucleotide FBal (5′-CTTGGCCATGCCGGTGATTTTC-3′) and the M13 reverse primer. This PCR fragment was inserted into the BalI and XhoI sites of vector pCRSEF/2 to create vector FBalCRF/2. The fusion part of the DNA construct was sequenced. Finally, the SmaI fragment of pHP45Ω (31Prentki P. Krisch H.M. Gene (Amst.). 1984; 29: 303-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (1343) Google Scholar) carrying the streptomycin/spectinomycin resistance genes was inserted into the HpaI site of pCRSEF/2 and FBalCRF/2, generating plasmids pCRSEF/3 and FBalCRF/3 which served as integrative vectors for the genetic manipulation of S. elongatus. Wild type and mutant strains from S. elongatus were cultivated as described (32Mühlenhoff U. Chauvat F. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1996; 252: 93-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Genetic manipulations of the psaF/psaJ locus from S. elongatus were carried out using thepsaF −/Kmr strain FK2, which carries a psaF gene disrupted by a kanamycin resistance marker (32Mühlenhoff U. Chauvat F. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1996; 252: 93-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Prior to transformation, FK2 was grown in medium D supplemented with 40 μg/ml kanamycin. Cells were transformed by electroporation in the presence of plasmids pCRSEF/3 or FBalCRF/3 essentially as described previously, selected for streptomycin resistance in liquid cultures, and colony-purified on solid media (32Mühlenhoff U. Chauvat F. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1996; 252: 93-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). From these initial clones, strains with the desiredKms/Smr phenotype were selected by replica plating on solid media containing either 2 μg/ml streptomycin or 25 μg/ml kanamycin. Cells carrying the C. reinhardtii psaFgene were identified by either immunoblot analysis of photosynthetic membranes isolated from small scale cultures using anti-C. reinhardtii (20Farah J. Rappaport F. Choquet Y. Joliot P. Rochaix J.-D. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4976-4984Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar) or anti-S. elongatus PsaF antibodies 2U. Mühlenhoff, unpublished. or by Southern blot analysis of genomic DNA as described (32Mühlenhoff U. Chauvat F. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1996; 252: 93-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Photosystem I complexes were extracted from PSII-depleted membranes by 0.6% w/v β-dodecyl maltoside and purified by centrifugation in sucrose gradients as described (33Rögner M. Mühlenhoff U. Boekema E. Witt H.T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1015: 415-424Crossref Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 34Rögner M. Nixon P.J. Diner B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 6189-6196Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). PSI fromC. reinhardtii was isolated as described (19Hippler M. Drepper F. Farah J. Rochaix J.-D. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 6343-6349Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), and plastocyanin and cytochrome c 6 were isolated from C. reinhardtii following the protocol of Ref. 6Merchant S. Bogorad L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1986; 6: 462-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar with modifications described in Ref. 19Hippler M. Drepper F. Farah J. Rochaix J.-D. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 6343-6349Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar. Cytochromec 6 from S. elongatus was isolated essentially according to Ref. 35Koike H. Katoh S. Plant Cell Physiol. 1979; 20: 1157-1161Google Scholar. Plastocyanin and cytochromec 6 concentrations were determined spectroscopically using absorption coefficients of ε597 nm = 4.9 mm1cm1 and ε552 nm= 20 mm1 cm1, respectively (19Hippler M. Drepper F. Farah J. Rochaix J.-D. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 6343-6349Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). For the fast immunoblot analysis of photosynthetic membranes, 3.5-ml cultures of S. elongatus were grown to OD750 = 1, harvested by centrifugation, washed once in 1 ml of HMCM buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.8, 10 mmCaCl2, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.5m mannitol), resuspended in 50 μl of HMCM buffer, and frozen. The thawed suspension was incubated with 2 mg/ml lysozyme for 30 min at 48 °C and frozen. Cells were then lysed by the addition of 10 volumes of MCM (MMCM minus mannitol), and the photosynthetic membranes were recovered by centrifugation in a microcentrifuge at 4 °C for 10 min at maximum speed. Membranes were washed once in 500 μl of MCM supplemented with 0.1% sulfobetain 10, pelleted by centrifugation, and resuspended in SDS loading buffer at a concentration of approximately 0.25 mg of chlorophyll/ml. Cytochrome c 6 and plastocyanin were chemically cross-linked to photosystem I essentially as described (19Hippler M. Drepper F. Farah J. Rochaix J.-D. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 6343-6349Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar); PSI particles at a concentration of 0.1 mg of chlorophyll/ml in 30 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 3 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm ascorbate were incubated in the presence of 20 μm plastocyanin or cytochrome c 6with 5 mm N-ethyl-3-(3-diaminopropyl)carbodiimide and 10 mm N-hydroxysulfosuccinimide for 45 min in darkness. The reactions were terminated by addition of ammonium acetate to a final concentration of 0.2 m and diluted 4-fold. PSI complexes were sedimented by centrifugation at 200,000 ×g for 45 min and resuspended in 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 0.05% Triton X-100. Analytical SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was carried out using 15 or 16.5% (w/v) polyacrylamide gels (36Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies, A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988Google Scholar). For immunoblot analysis, PSI complexes equivalent to 4 μg of chlorophyll and membrane preparations equivalent to 10 μg of chlorophyll were analyzed. Western blots and antibody incubations were carried out essentially as described (36Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies, A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988Google Scholar). Immunodetection reactions were performed using anti-rabbit IgG antibodies linked to horseradish peroxidase followed by enhanced chemiluminescence detection (ECL, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Flash-induced absorption changes at 817 nm were measured at 296 K on a single beam spectrophotometer essentially as described (15Drepper F. Hippler M. Nitschke W. Haehnel W. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 1282-1295Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Flash excitation was performed using a frequency-doubled Nd:YAG laser (5 ns full width at half maximum). The measuring light was provided by a luminescence diode (Hitachi HE8404SG, 40 milliwatts, 30 nm full width at half maximum), filtered through an 817-nm interference filter (9 nm full width at half maximum), and passed through a cuvette with an optical path length of 1 cm that contained 200 μl of sample. For flash-absorption experiments, PSI reaction centers were suspended in the presence or absence of cytochrome c 6 or plastocyanin at a standard concentration of 50 μm chlorophyll in 30 mmMops, pH 7.0, supplemented with 0.05% β-dodecyl maltoside, 0.2 mm methyl viologen, 0.1 mm diaminodurene, 1 mm sodium ascorbate, and MgCl2 as indicated in the figure legends. For measurements at high donor concentrations (Fig.6), a cuvette with 3-mm optical path length was used that contained 30 μl of sample. Four individual signals were averaged, and the resulting kinetic traces were fitted to a sum of one or two exponential components and a constant offset with the program GNUPLOT (Unix version 3.5, Williams), performing nonlinear least squares fitting using the Marquart-Levenberg algorithm. To generate an S. elongatusstrain carrying the psaF gene from C. reinhardtii, integrative vectors were introduced into the S. elongatus strain FK2 that carries a psaF gene interrupted by a kanamycin resistance cassette and thus served as apsaF-free background ((32) see Fig.1, middle part). Vector constructions were performed using the genomic fragment from S. elongatus carrying the psaF/psaJ locus ((29) seetop of Fig. 1) as follows. First, we took into account that the PsaF subunit is expressed as a precursor protein carrying an N-terminal export sequence required for the translocation of the N terminus of the protein into the periplasma. In order to be efficiently recognized by the cyanobacterial export apparatus, the hybridpsaF gene should therefore contain the entire cyanobacterial export sequence and the ASA-D cleavage site of the export protease. Second, in cyanobacteria, psaF and psaJ are arranged in an operon. In order to avoid any interference with the expression of the PsaJ subunit which is likely to be involved in the binding of PsaF to PSI, the organization of the psaF/psaJoperon should be maintained (25Xu Q. Xu L. Chitnis V. Chitnis P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3205-3211Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (see Fig. 1). As shown in Fig. 1 (bottom) and Fig.2, the integrative vector FBalCRF/3 carries a gene encoding a hybrid PsaF protein that contains the cyanobacterial signal sequence (up to codon Asp-24 of S. elongatus psaF), the N-terminal domain of PsaF from C. reinhardtii (30Franzén L.G. Frank G. Zuber H. Rochaix J.D. Plant Mol. Biol. 1989; 12: 463-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) (i.e. between codons Asp-63/Ile-64 to codon His-145), and the hydrophobic C-terminal part of the cyanobacterial subunit (starting with codon Ala-60 of S. elongatus psaF) which is assumed to anchor the protein to the hydrophobic core of PSI. A streptomycin/spectinomycin resistance gene cassette was inserted at the HpaI site located 165 base pairs downstream of psaJ, well downstream of the transcribed region of the psaF/psaJ operon (see “Experimental Procedures” for details of the construction). In addition to FBalCRF/3, a vector, pCRSEF/3, was constructed in which the complete region of the psaF gene from S. elongatusencoding the entire mature PsaF subunit was replaced by the corresponding part of psaF from C. reinhardtii(see “Experimental Procedures”). However, following the introduction of this vector into S. elongatus, C. reinhardtii PsaF was not recovered in PSI although it was verified by Southern blot analysis that the gene was cointegrated together with the antibiotic resistance marker and inserted correctly into the genome (not shown). Following the electroporation of thepsaF-deletion strain FK2 from S. elongatus in the presence of the plasmid pFBalCRF/3, streptomycin-resistant transformants with the desired Kms/Smrphenotype were selected by replica plating on solid media, and those expressing the chimeric C. reinhardtii-S. elongatus PsaF protein were screened by immunoblot analysis using anti-C. reinhardtii-PsaF antibodies (not shown, see “Experimental Procedures”). The organization of the psaF/psaJ locus of one of these strains, H53, was investigated by Southern blot analysis shown in Fig. 3. First, upon hybridization with a 500-base pair fragment from a C. reinhardtii psaF cDNA clone carrying part of the gene encoding the mature PsaF, a single 6.3-kb genomic EcoRV restriction fragment is detected that is not present in S. elongatus wild type nor in strain FK2 (Fig. 3 A). The same DNA fragment is detected in H53 DNA after hybridization with a probe carrying theSm r /Sp r genes inserted into pFBalCRF/3 (Fig. 3 B). Taken together, these blots indicate that the region of the psaF gene of C. reinhardtii has been inserted with the antibiotic marker gene into the genome of S. elongatus. Furthermore, when the blots were probed with the ClaI/XhoI fragment carrying thepsaF, psaJ, and rpl9 genes, only single EcoRV fragments of ∼13 and 14.5 kb are observed in DNA from wild type and strain FK2. The size difference is due to the presence of the Km r marker gene in FK2 (Fig.3 C, see Fig. 1). For strain H53, however, twoEcoRV fragments of ∼8.0 and 6.3 kb are detected, indicating that a new EcoRV site has been introduced into the psaF/psaJ locus of H53. Since theSm r /Sp r marker genes do not contain an EcoRV site, the existence of a newEcoRV restriction site together with theSm r /Sp r genes at thepsaF/psaJ gene locus indicates that the entire part of thepsaF gene that originates from C. reinhardtii has been introduced into strain H53, because C. reinhardtii psaFis flanked by a new EcoRV site and theSm r /Sp r genes in the integrative vector pFBalCRF/3 (Fig. 1). Finally, when the blots were probed with a fragment carrying the Kmr marker present in strain FK2, no hybridization signal was observed in DNA from strain H53 (Fig.3 D). This result indicates that H53 represents a fully segregated mutant in which the original psaF/psaJ gene locus of strain FK2 that carried a kanamycin resistance gene has been completely replaced by the new psaF gene at thepsaF/psaJ gene locus in all copies of the polyploid genome. Essentially the same conclusion was obtained by a similar Southern blot analysis that was carried out using EcoRI-restricted DNA (not shown). The expression pattern of the psaF genes in S. elongatus wild type and strains FK2 and H53 was monitored by Western blot analysis of photosynthetic membran"
https://openalex.org/W2070241138,"Haemophilus ducreyi, the cause of the sexually transmitted disease chancroid produces a lipooligosaccharide (LOS) containing a terminal sialylN-acetyllactosamine trisaccharide. Previously, we reported the identification and characterization of theN-acetylneuraminic acid cytidylsynthetase gene (neuA). Forty-nine base pairs downstream of the synthetase gene is an open reading frame (ORF) encoding a protein with a predicted molecular weight of 34,646. This protein has weak homology to the polysialyltransferase of Escherichia coli K92. Downstream of this ORF is the gene encoding the H. ducreyi homologue of the Salmonella typhimurium rmlB gene. Mutations were constructed in the neuA gene and the gene encoding the second ORF by insertion of an Ω kanamycin cassette, and isogenic strains were constructed. LOS was isolated from each strain and characterized by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, carbohydrate, and mass spectrometric analysis. LOS isolated from strains containing a mutation in neuA or in the second ORF, designatedlst, lacked the sialic acid-containing glycoform. Complementation studies were performed. The neuA gene and the lst gene were each cloned into the shuttle vector pLS88 after polymerase chain reaction amplification. Complementation of the mutation in the lst gene was observed, but we were unable to complement the neuA mutation. Since it is possible that transcription of the neuA gene and the lst gene were coupled, we constructed a nonpolar mutation in theneuA gene. In this construct, the neuAmutation was complemented, suggesting transcriptional coupling of theneuA gene and the lst gene. Sialyltransferase activity was detected by incorporation of 14C-labeled NeuAc from CMP-NeuAc into trichloroacetic acid-precipitable material when thelst gene was overexpressed in the nonpolar neuAmutant. We conclude that the lst gene encodes the H. ducreyi sialyltransferase. Since the lst gene product has little, if any, structural relationship to other sialyltransferases, this protein represents a new class of sialyltransferase.

Haemophilus ducreyi is the causative agent of chancroid, a genital ulcer disease, which is prevalent in many developing countries. In urban areas of the United States, chancroid occurs sporadically as outbreaks (1Morse S.A. Clin. Microbiol. Rev. 1989; 2: 137-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 2Abeck D. Johnson A.P.

However, recent studies suggest that chancroid may be greatly underreported due to inadequate methods of detection (4Flood J.M. Sarafian S.K. Bolan G.A. Lammel C. Engelman J. Greenblatt R.M.

Chancroid and other ulcerative sexually transmitted diseases have been epidemiologically linked to the heterosexual transmission of the human immunodeficiency virus in areas where both diseases are epidemic (6Jessamine P.G.

Furthermore, individuals infected with human immunodeficiency virus are less responsive to standard antibiotic treatment for chancroid (7Wasserheit J.N. Sex. Transm.

Med. 1993; 119: 1181-1186Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). The mechanisms of H. ducreyi virulence are not well understood. However, several putative virulence determinants have recently been identified and characterized. Two different cytotoxins have been identified that cause cytopathic effects to human foreskin fibroblasts and epithelial cells. The cytotoxins and genes that encode them have been characterized. A hemolytic cytotoxin, encoded by thehhdA and hhdB genes, has been identified and demonstrated to be responsible for the cytopathic effects H. ducreyi exerts on human foreskin fibroblasts (9Palmer K.L. Munson Jr., R.S. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 18: 821-830Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 10Palmer K.L. Goldman W.E. Munson Jr., R.S. Mol.

The second cytotoxin produced by H. ducreyi, which is toxic for epithelial cells, is a homologue of cytolethal distending toxin, which is produced by Campylobacter jejuni, Shigella dysenteriae and certain Escherichia coli strains (12Cope L.D. Lumbley S. Latimer J.L. Klesney-Tait J. Stevens M.K. Johnson L.S. Purven M. Munson Jr., R.S. Lagergard T. Radolf J.D. Hansen E.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Several studies have demonstrated that the LOS of H. ducreyi causes ulcers in rabbits and mice (13Campagnari A.A. Wild L.M. Griffiths G.E. Karalus R.J. Wirth M.A. Spinola S.M. Infect. Immun. 1991; 59: 2601-2608Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14Lagergard T. Microb. Pathog. 1992; 13: 203-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 15Tuffrey M. Alexander F. Ballard R.C. Taylor-Robinson D. J. Exp. Pathol. 1990; 71: 233-244Google Scholar). LOS also plays a role in the adherence ofH. ducreyi to human foreskin fibroblasts and keratinocytes (16Gibson B.W. Campagnari A.A. Melaugh W. Phillips N.J. Apicella M.A. Grass S. Wang J. Palmer K.L. Munson Jr., R.S. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 5062-5071Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17Alfa M.J. DeGagne P. Microb. Pathog. 1997; 22: 39-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The LOS from H. ducreyi and other Gram-negative mucosal pathogens, such as Haemophilus influenzae,Neisseria meningitidis, and Neisseria gonorrhoeae, are structurally similar, and some of these LOS glycoforms have been shown to mimic human antigens, such as paragloboside and other glycosphingolipids (18Mandrell R.E.

Molecular mimicry may allow these organisms to evade the host's immune system. One important aspect of molecular mimicry in these organisms is the presence of sialic acid as a component of their LOS. Although commonly found in higher animals, sialic acids have been found in relatively few microorganisms, and their presence is often associated with virulence (22Schauer R. Kelm S. Reuter G. Roggentin P. Shaw L. Rosenberg A. Biology of the Sialic Acids. Plenum Press, New York1995: 7-67Crossref Google Scholar). For example, the sialic acid-containing capsules of N. meningitidis, E. coli K1, and group B streptococci are important virulence factors (23Timmis K.N. Boulnois G.J. Bitter S.D. Cabello F.C. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1985; 118: 197-218PubMed Google Scholar, 24Jennings H.J. Katzenellenbogen E. Lugowski C. Michon F. Roy R. Kasper D.L. Pure Appl.

Birkhauser Verlag, Basel, Switzerland1993: 11-24Google Scholar). Similarly, sialylation of the LOS ofN. gonorrhoeae is now viewed as a major factor in the organism's pathogenicity (27Smith H. Parsons N.J. Cole J.A. Microb. Pathog. 1995; 19: 365-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Because of its terminal position on carbohydrates, sialic acid is one of the first molecules encountered in cellular interactions and has been found to have important roles in cellular recognition (22Schauer R. Kelm S. Reuter G. Roggentin P. Shaw L. Rosenberg A. Biology of the Sialic Acids. Plenum Press, New York1995: 7-67Crossref Google Scholar). Structural studies of the LOS glycoforms have been carried out on several H. ducreyi strains (28Schweda E.K. Sundstrom A.C. Eriksson L.M. Jonasson J.A. Lindberg A.A. J. Biol.

The LOS from these strains are variable; however, it has been determined that the principal glycoform expressed by most strains of H. ducreyiterminates in N-acetyllactosamine. The terminal galactose residue of this disaccharide acceptor is then partially substituted (approximately one-third of the total LOS glycoforms) with a single sialic acid residue to form the nonreducing terminal trisaccharide, sialyl N-acetyllactosamine. Previously, we reported the purification ofN-acetylneuraminic acid cytidylsynthetase (CMP-NeuAc synthetase) and the cloning of the gene, neuA, encoding this enzyme (35Tullius M.V. Munson Jr., R.S. Wang J. Gibson B.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15373-15380Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). CMP-NeuAc synthetase is responsible for catalyzing the condensation reaction of CTP and neuraminic acid (NeuAc) to form CMP-NeuAc. We identified the neuA gene in a H. ducreyi λ library. In order to determine whether additional genes relevant to LOS biosynthesis were closely linked to theneuA gene, we determined the DNA sequence 5′ and 3′ of theneuA gene. The gene encoding the H. ducreyisialyltransferase was identified as well as homologues of thermlB (rfbB) and rmlA (rfbA) genes of many Gram-negative bacteria. Isogenic mutants of H. ducreyi were constructed that were deficient in both the CMP-NeuAc synthetase and the sialyltransferase. Glucosamine, NeuAc, and anhydrous hydrazine were from Sigma. 2,5-Dihydroxybenzoic acid was from Aldrich. Acrylamide/bisacrylamide solution (40% (w/v), 37.5:1 monomer to cross-linker), electrophoresis quality Tris, glycine, and SDS were from Bio-Rad. Dialysis tubing was from Spectrum (Houston, TX). Constant boiling 6 n HCl was from Pierce. CMP-[14C]NeuAc was from NEN Life Science Products. The bacterial strains and plasmids used in this study are listed in TableI. H. ducreyi strains were grown on chocolate agar or in brain heart infusion broth as described previously (10Palmer K.L. Goldman W.E. Munson Jr., R.S. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 21: 13-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). When necessary, chocolate agar was supplemented with kanamycin at 20 μg ml−1, streptomycin at 20 μg ml−1, and/or X-gal at 40 μg ml−1. AllE. coli strains were grown on Luria-Bertani (LB) plates or in LB broth. When necessary, this medium included X-gal at 40 μg ml−1 and/or the appropriate antibiotics. Ampicillin was used at 50 μg ml−1, kanamycin was at 20 μg ml−1, and streptomycin was at 20 μg ml−1.Table IBacteria and plasmidsStrainDescriptionReference or sourceE. coliDH5αLife Technologies, Inc.DH5αpcnBpcnB, zad∷Tn10G.

Restriction enzymes and T4 DNA ligase were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. Electroporation of E. coli and H. ducreyi was performed as described previously (36Bozue J.A. Tarantino L. Munson Jr., R.S. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1998; 164: 269-273Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Standard recombinant DNA methods were performed as described previously (37Maniatis T. Fritsch E.F. Sambrook J. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1982Google Scholar). DNA sequence was determined through cycle sequencing using ABI PRISM Dye Terminator Cycle Sequencing Ready Reaction kits. Cycle sequencing was carried out on a GeneAMP PCR System 9600 (Perkin-Elmer). The samples were then passed through Cetri-Sep columns and run on either an ABI 310 genetic analyzer or an ABI 377 DNA sequencer. Sequence analysis and comparisons were performed with Lasergene (DnaStar, Madison, WI) and GCG software (38Devereux J. Haeberli P. Smithies O. Nucleic Acids Res. 1984; 12: 387-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (11514) Google Scholar), as well as with the NCBI Blast server. To mutate the LOS genes of interest on plasmid pRSM1627 (Fig. 1), uniqueSrfI restriction enzyme sites were introduced into theneuA and lst genes utilizing the Chameleon double-stranded, site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The sequences of the mutagenic primers containing the SrfI sites as well as a selection primer designed to change a nonessential unique restriction enzyme site (XhoI) present in pRSM1627 into aBglII site are shown in TableII. Plasmids containing a SrfI site in the neuA or lst genes were identified by restriction analysis, confirmed by determination of DNA sequence, and saved as pRSM1681 and pRSM1712, respectively (Table I). The Ω-Km-2 cassette from pJRS102.0 was then cloned into the unique SrfI site constructed in the neuA and lst genes in pRSM1681 and pRSM1712, respectively. Constructions were verified by restriction analysis, and plasmids containing the Ω-Km-2 cassette in the neuA or lst genes were saved as pRSM1682 and pRSM1896, respectively (Table I).Table IIPrimers used in this studyPrimerSequenceRangeSrfI-neuAP-GGTATTTCATTGGTTGCCCGGGCGATTATCGC2090–2121SrfI-lstP-AATCCGGTTATTTTGCCCGGGCTGGTTTTCATCCAA3098–3131XhoI–BglIIP-ATCGATACCGTCGACAGATCTGGGGGGCCGCGTACCSSF5ATCATTTTGCCATTATCTAC1821–1840SSR6AGAAAACGTCCTCTACATT2831–2813SSF3GATATTGATGCAATTATTGATC2630–2651JWT2TCCTATTTACAATGTGATTTAATC3652–3629The SrfI sites are represented by boldface letters.

Tarantino L. Munson Jr., R.S. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1998; 164: 269-273Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, we observed that the hydrolysis product of X-gal was toxic to H. ducreyi.Further, we observed that cointegrates were readily obtained after electroporation of H. ducreyi with a suicide plasmid containing an insertionally inactivated gene followed by selection with the appropriate antibiotic. Thus, the NotI fragments containing the insertionally inactivated neuA orlst genes were cloned into pRSM1791, a ColE1 vector that expresses β-galactosidase. Cointegrates were constructed in H. ducreyi 35000HP by electroporation with plasmid DNA followed by selection on chocolate plates containing kanamycin. Kanamycin-resistant clones were then streaked for isolation on chocolate agar containing kanamycin and X-gal. Isogenic H. ducreyi mutants were identified as large white colonies, whereas cointegrates appear as small blue colonies on this medium. After verification of the constructions by Southern hybridization (see below), theneuA and lst mutants were saved as strains 35000HP-RSM202 and 35000HP-RSM203, respectively (Table I). A nonpolar neuA mutant was also constructed. In this instance, the nonpolar kanamycin cassette constructed by Menardet al. (39Menard R. Sansonetti P.J. Parsot C. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 5899-5906Crossref PubMed Scopus (612) Google Scholar) was used for insertional inactivation of theneuA gene in SrfI-digested pRSM1681. An isogenicH. ducreyi strain with a nonpolar mutation in theneuA gene was constructed as described above and saved as 35000HP-RSM208. DNA was isolated from the H. ducreyi strains by a modified procedure (40Barcak G.J. Chandler M.S. Redfield R.J. Tomb J.F. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 204: 321-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar) using the Stratagene Chromosomal DNA isolation kit. Chromosomal DNA was digested with BglII, subjected to electrophoresis on a 0.7% agarose gel, and transferred to a nylon membrane using the Turbo Blotter kit (Schleicher & Schuell). Probes were radiolabeled with 32P using the RadPrime DNA Labeling System (Life Technologies). Hybridization and washes were performed as described (10Palmer K.L. Goldman W.E. Munson Jr., R.S. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 21: 13-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The neuA andlst genes were amplified by PCR using the primers shown in Table II. The PCR products were cloned into pCR2.1, and the amplified genes were then cloned as EcoRI fragments intoEcoRI-digested pLS88. The resulting plasmids were electroporated into the corresponding isogenic H. ducreyimutants, and clones were selected on chocolate agar plates containing streptomycin. The respective plasmids were designated pNEUA and pLST. LOS, used in the chemical, mass spectrometric, and SDS-PAGE analysis, was prepared from H. ducreyi cells that were grown overnight in 0.5–1 liters of liquid medium (yielding 140–320 mg, dry weight, of cells) and extracted using a modified version of the hot phenol-water procedure (41Westphal O.

Schneider H. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 235: 242-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Typical yields were 0.1–0.4% of the bacterial dry weight. Alternatively, when small quantities of LOS were needed only for SDS-PAGE analysis, LOS was extracted from H. ducreyi cells that were grown overnight on two chocolate agar plates. Cells were suspended, washed with 10 ml of PBS containing 0.15 mmCaCl2 and 0.5 mm MgCl2, and extracted using the hot phenol micromethod (44Inzana T.J. J. Infect. Dis. 1983; 148: 492-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Aliquots of LOS suspended in H2O were diluted to 7.5–30 ng/μl with Bio-Rad Laemmli sample buffer (62.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 25% glycerol, 0.01% bromphenol blue) with 2% β-mercaptoethanol. Typically, samples were diluted 7–700-fold with this buffer to obtain these concentrations. The samples were heated in a boiling water bath for 5 min and allowed to cool before loading 100–200 ng of LOS into the sample wells. A 16% acrylamide resolving gel with a 4% stacking gel (14 cm × 16 cm × 0.75 mm) was used to separate the LOS (45Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205461) Google Scholar). A current of 15 mA was applied for 5 h. Bromphenol blue migrates off the end of the gel after approximately 4.5 h under these conditions. LOS was visualized by silver staining according to the method of Tsai and Frasch, with a few minor changes (46Tsai C.M. Frasch C.E. Anal. Biochem. 1982; 119: 115-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (2278) Google Scholar). The overnight fixing step was shortened from overnight to 30 min, and the first three 15-min washes were shortened to 10 min each. SDS-PAGE analysis of the outer membrane proteins of the isogenic mutant strains of H. ducreyi and 35000HP was performed as described previously (10Palmer K.L. Goldman W.E. Munson Jr., R.S. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 21: 13-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). To prepare a water-soluble LOS species amenable to mass spectrometric analysis, O-acyl groups were removed by treatment with hydrazine (47Helander I.M. Lindner B. Brade H. Altmann K. Lindberg A.A. Rietschel E.T. Zahringer U. Eur. J. Biochem. 1988; 177: 483-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Anhydrous hydrazine (20–100 μl) was added to lyophilized LOS samples to give a concentration of 1–10 μg/μl of LOS. The reaction was heated at 37 °C for 20 min with occasional vortexing. After chilling the reactions at −20 °C for at least 10 min, chilled acetone (8–10 volumes) was slowly added to destroy the hydrazine and precipitate theO-deacylated LOS. The precipitate was pelleted by centrifugation (14,000 × g for 120 min, 0–4 °C), and the supernatant was carefully removed. The pellet was suspended in a second, equivalent amount of chilled acetone, and the centrifugation was repeated. After removing the supernatant, the pellet was dissolved in a small volume of water and lyophilized. NeuAc was released from O-deacylated LOS by mild acid hydrolysis using standard conditions (48Reuter G. Schauer R. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 230: 168-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). O-Deacylated LOS (1–3 μl, 5–20 μg) was diluted to 30 μl with water, mixed with 10 μl of 0.4 m HCl, and heated at 80 °C for 60 min. After cooling, 12 μl of 0.4 m NaOH was added, and the samples were frozen until ready for analysis by high pH anion exchange chromatography with pulsed amperometric detection. The entire sample was injected into a 500-μl loop on a Dionex HPLC system with a CarboPac PA1 column (Dionex; 4 × 250 mm), guard column, and in-line filter. The column was eluted with 0.4 m NaOH, and the PAD waveform potentials were as follows: 0.05 V (0.4 s), 0.75 V (0.2 s), −0.15 V (0.4 s). Quantitation was performed by treating known quantities of NeuAc (100–6400 pmol) under exactly the same hydrolysis conditions to prepare a calibration curve. To determine the molar amount of O-deacylated LOS used for NeuAc quantitation, the glucosamine content of theO-deacylated LOS was determined. An aliquot ofO-deacylated LOS identical to the aliquot used for NeuAc analysis was mixed with 100 μl of 6 n HCl and heated at 100 °C for 4 h to liberate glucosamine. After cooling, the solution was diluted to 1 ml and lyophilized. Before analysis, the samples were redissolved in 100 μl of H2O and injected on the Dionex high pressure liquid chromatography system as for NeuAc quantitation except that elution was performed isocratically with 16 mm NaOH. Quantitation of glucosamine was performed by preparing a calibration curve from injections of a glucosamine standard (500–8000 pmol) in 100 μl of H2O. A glucosamine standard (5000 pmol) was treated in the same manner as theO-deacylated LOS samples to estimate the amount of losses due to sample handling. Prior to mass spectrometric analysis, O-deacylated LOS samples (5–50 μg) dissolved in H2O were diluted 5–10-fold with 50% CH3CN to give approximately 0.2–1 μg/μl of O-deacylated LOS. A small quantity (roughly 20–100 μl) of Dowex 50 × 100–200-mesh beads (NH4+ form) suspended in 50% CH3CN was added to the O-deacylated LOS solutions, and the tubes were mildly agitated for several minutes to desalt the O-deacylated LOS. A 1-μl aliquot of this solution was mixed with 1 μl of 100 mm2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid (recrystallized from H2O) in 50% CH3CN, and then 1 μl of the mixture was spotted on the MALDI sample plate and allowed to air-dry. For analysis of the samples, a Voyager-DE time-of-flight (TOF) mass spectrometer with a nitrogen laser (337 nm) was operated in the negative ion mode using an accelerating voltage of 20 kV, a grid voltage of 93%, a guide wire voltage of 0.05%, and a delay time of 200 ns. The instrument was calibrated externally using bovine insulin β-chain (oxidized) (average [M − H]− = 3494.9 Da) and ACTH 1–24 (average [M − H]− = 2932.5 Da). H. ducreyi cells"

The requirement for branched chain amino acids was explained on the basis of the oxidative inactivation of the dihydroxy acid dehydratase (3Kuo C.F. Mashino T. Fridovich I. J. Biol.

The requirement for sulfur-containing amino acids was attributable to leakage of sulfite from the cells (7Benov L. Kredich N.M. Fridovich I. J. Biol.

We have now investigated the aromatic amino acid auxotrophy of thesodA sodB strain and find an explanation quite different from those that rationalized the other amino acid auxotrophies. Thus, the aromatic biosynthetic pathway begins with the condensation of erythrose-4-phosphate (E-4-P) 1The abbreviations used are: E-4-P, erythrose-4-phosphate; DAHP, 3-deoxy-d-arabino heptulosonate-7-phosphate; TK, transketolase; PEP, phosphoenol pyruvate; SOD, superoxide dismutase (Cu, Zn); sodA, the gene encoding the MnSOD; sodB, the gene encoding the FeSOD; LB, Luria-Bertani.1The abbreviations used are: E-4-P, erythrose-4-phosphate; DAHP, 3-deoxy-d-arabino heptulosonate-7-phosphate; TK, transketolase; PEP, phosphoenol pyruvate; SOD, superoxide dismutase (Cu, Zn); sodA, the gene encoding the MnSOD; sodB, the gene encoding the FeSOD; LB, Luria-Bertani. with phosphoenol pyruvate (PEP) to yield 3-deoxy-d-arabino-heptulosonate-7-phosphate (DAHP), and the production of E-4-P in turn is dependent on the sequential actions of transketolase (TK) and transaldolase. It has been shown that the intermediate of the TK reaction, which is 1,2-dihydroxyethyl thiamine pyrophosphate, is oxidized by O2− (9Asami S. Akazawa T. Biochemistry. 1977; 16: 2201-2207Crossref Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 10Takabe T. Asami S. Akazawa T. Biochemistry. 1980; 19: 3985-3989Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). We now report that this oxidation interferes with the production of E-4-P and thus accounts for the decrease of aromatic biosynthesis in aerobicsodA sodB E. coli. The E. coli strains used were AB1157 parental: JI132 (11Imlay J. Linn S. J. Bacteriol. 1987; 169: 2967-2976Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar), sodA sodB; BJ502 (Hfr C str-stkt-2) (12Josephson B.L. Frankel D.G. J. Bacteriol. 1974; 118: 1082-1089Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,13Josephson B. Frankel D.G. J. Bacteriol. 1969; 100: 1289-1295Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which lacks the ability to produce transketolase A; and BJ502tkt+, which has a functional tkA and DH52/pkD44B, prepared by insertion of a 5-kb BamHI fragment encoding transketolase A into the TcR cosmid pLAFR3 (14Friedman A.M. Long S.R. Brown S.E. Buikema W.J. Ausubel F.M. Gene (Amst.). 1982; 18: 289-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar). These stains have TK activities of 0.03, 0.17, and 1.5 units/mg, respectively (15Draths K.M. Pompliano D.L. Conley D.L. Frost J.W. Berry A. Disbrow G.L. Staversky R.J. Lievense J.C. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1992; 114: 3956-3962Crossref Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Unless otherwise specified all strains were grown overnight in aerobic LB medium at 37 °C and were then diluted into the test media. When the test medium was one that contained 17 amino acids, but lacking Tyr, Trp, and Phe, the inoculum was taken from an overnight culture in anaerobic minimal medium to avoid transfer of aromatic amino acids from LB medium. The 17-amino acid medium contained M9 salts (16Maniatis T. Fitsch E.F. Sambrook J. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1982: 68-69Google Scholar) supplemented with 100 mg/liter concentrations of the 20 amino acids commonly found in proteins except the three aromatics. In each case the defined medium also contained 0.2% glucose plus 3 mg/liter pantothenic acid and thiamine. Minimal medium contained the vitamins mentioned above plus 100 mg/liter Thr, Leu, His, Pro, and Arg and 0.2% glucose. When enzyme activities were to be assayed, cultures were grown toA 600 nm of 0.5–0.6 and were washed twice in the chilled buffer to be used in the assay. The washed cells were disrupted in a French press, and the extracts were clarified by centrifugation before assay. The assays were performed as described in the published reports: thus DAHP synthase (17Schoner R. Hermann K.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 5440-5447Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), 3-dehydroquinate synthase (18Mehdi S. Frost J.W. Knowles J.R. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 142: 306-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar), 3-dehydroquinate dehydratase (19Chaudhuri S. Duncan K. Coggins J. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 142: 320-324PubMed Google Scholar), shikimate dehydrogenase (20Chaudhuri S. Anton I.A. Coggins J.R. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 142: 315-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), TK (12Josephson B.L. Frankel D.G. J. Bacteriol. 1974; 118: 1082-1089Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 21Datta A.G. Racker E. J. Biol. Chem. 1961; 236: 617-623Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and transaldolase (21Datta A.G. Racker E. J. Biol. Chem. 1961; 236: 617-623Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The following substrates, needed for these assays, were prepared by published procedures as follows: DAHP (22Frost J.W. Knowles J.R. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 4465-4469Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), 3-dehydroquinate (23Crewe R. Haendler H. Biochem. Prep. 1966; 11: 21-26Google Scholar), and 5-dehydroshikimate (24Haslan E. Haworth R.D. Knowles P.F. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 142: 498-501Google Scholar). Metabolites were assayed in the cell extracts as follows: PEP (25Lowry O.H. Carther J. Ward J.B. Glaser L. J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 6511-6521Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), ATP (Sigma bioluminescent assay kit) and E-4-P (26Paoletti F. Williams J.F. Horecker B.L. Anal. Biochem. 1979; 95: 250-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Culture fluids that had been centrifuged and then passed through a 0.22-μm filter were assayed for DAHP (27Tribe D.E. Camakaris H. Pittard J. J. Bacteriol. 1976; 127: 1085-1097Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and 3-dehydroquinate (27Tribe D.E. Camakaris H. Pittard J. J. Bacteriol. 1976; 127: 1085-1097Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) to check for leakage of these intermediates. Hyperoxia was achieved in specifically fabricated stainless steel vessels, which were maintained at 37 °C after pressurization. As previously noted (2Imlay J.A. Fridovich I. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 953-961Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) the sodAsodB strain of E. coli exhibited an auxotrophy for Phe + Tyr + Trp. This auxotrophy is not attributable to leakage of metabolic intermediates, because it was not relieved by 0.25m sucrose, which did relieve the Cys + Met auxotrophy (7Benov L. Kredich N.M. Fridovich I. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21037-21040Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar,8Benov L. Fridovich I. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 347: 271-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) (data not shown). To localize the point of blockage of aromatic biosynthesis, shikimate was tested and was found to replace the aromatic amino acid requirement. These results are shown in Fig.1. Thus line 5 illustrates the very slow growth seen in the absence of the aromatics compared with the rapid growth when these were present (Fig. 1, line 1). Shikimate allowed growth almost as well as did the aromatics (Fig. 1,line 2). The shikimate was not a nonspecific stimulator of growth, because it did not augment the slow growth in the absence of Lys, Ser, and Gly (Fig. 1, lines 3 and 4). There are four enzymes on the pathway to the aromatic amino acids that precede shikimate; these are DAHP-synthase, 3-dehydroquinate synthase, 5-dehydroquinate dehydratase, and shikimate dehydrogenase. These were assayed in extracts of the parental and the sodA sodB strains using published procedures (12Josephson B.L. Frankel D.G. J. Bacteriol. 1974; 118: 1082-1089Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17Schoner R. Hermann K.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 5440-5447Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Mehdi S. Frost J.W.

J. Biol. Chem. 1961; 236: 617-623Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and preparing the necessary substrates as described (22Frost J.W. Knowles J.R. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 4465-4469Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 23Crewe R. Haendler H. Biochem. Prep. 1966; 11: 21-26Google Scholar, 24Haslan E. Haworth R.D. Knowles P.F. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 142: 498-501Google Scholar). None of these activities was found to be much lower in the sodA sodB extracts than in the parental strain when the extracts were assayed promptly (data not shown). It appeared that none of these four enzymes is a target for O2− and therefore that the effect of O2− on aromatic biosynthesis was exerted at some still earlier point. Because the first step in this pathway involves the condensation of PEP with E-4-P, the extracts were assayed for PEP and ATP. The results showed that although ATP > PEP, there was no significant difference between thesodA sodB and parental strains (data not shown). These negative results focussed our attention on E-4-P. E-4-P was not detectable in extracts of either AB1157 or JI132. E-4-P is made by the action of transaldolase on sedoheptulose-7-phosphate plus glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate, and sedoheptulose-7-phosphate in turn is made by the action of TK ond-xylulose-5-phosphate plusd-ribose-5-phosphate. TK is thus essential for the production of E-4-P and was considered a likely target for O2− both because of the previously reported oxidation of its 1,2-dihydroxyethyl thiamine pyrophosphate intermediate by O2− (9Asami S. Akazawa T. Biochemistry. 1977; 16: 2201-2207Crossref Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 10Takabe T. Asami S. Akazawa T. Biochemistry. 1980; 19: 3985-3989Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) and because TK-deficient mutants ofE. coli have been reported (12Josephson B.L. Frankel D.G. J. Bacteriol. 1974; 118: 1082-1089Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) to be aromatic amino acid auxotrophs. If O2− was interfering with the TK reaction, then thesodA sodB strain should have difficulty using ribose as a carbon source (12Josephson B.L. Frankel D.G. J. Bacteriol. 1974; 118: 1082-1089Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), because ribose catabolism depends on the direct oxidative pathway that uses TK. Fig.2 shows that the parental strain grew somewhat better on glucose than on ribose (compare lines 1and 2), whereas the sodA sodB strain grew very much better on glucose than on ribose (lines 3 and4). This result is in accord with expectations and with the reports that TK mutants do not grow on pentoses (12Josephson B.L. Frankel D.G. J. Bacteriol. 1974; 118: 1082-1089Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The ability of transketolase to scavenge O2− in a manner dependent on its keto sugar phosphate substrates has been reported (9Asami S. Akazawa T. Biochemistry. 1977; 16: 2201-2207Crossref Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 10Takabe T. Asami S. Akazawa T. Biochemistry. 1980; 19: 3985-3989Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) and has been attributed to a rapid oxidation of the 1,2-dihydroxyethyl thiamine pyrophosphate intermediate by O2−. In full accord with these reports we found that TK caused a dose-dependent inhibition of the reduction of cytochrome c by the aerobic xanthine oxidase reaction and that this was entirely dependent on the presence of either fructose-6-phosphate or xylulose-5-phosphate (data not shown). The first step in the oxidation by O2− of the thiamine-bound glycol intermediate of the TK must be a univalent process yielding a bound glycol radical. The final production of glycolate, shown earlier (9Asami S. Akazawa T. Biochemistry. 1977; 16: 2201-2207Crossref Scopus (23) Google Scholar,10Takabe T. Asami S. Akazawa T. Biochemistry. 1980; 19: 3985-3989Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), must depend on additional steps. It appeared possible that the bound glycolate radical might, with some frequency, oxidize and inactivate the enzyme. In that case TK activity should be lower in thesodA sodB strain than in the parental strain. As shown in Fig. 3, TK activity was lower in the SOD null strain than it was in the parental strain. This was also true, but to a lesser degree, of transaldolase, whereas there were no differences in glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase and 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase. If the relative paucity of TK in thesodA sodB strain had been attributable to inactivation of the enzyme by O2−, then paraquat should lower TK even in the parental strain. That this was the case is shown in Fig. 4. Thus line 1presents the increase in TK activity, which accompanied the outgrowth of a stationary phase inoculum of AB1157 in LB medium. In contrast, the increase of TK activity was much less in the case of JI132 (Fig. 4,line 2). Paraquat at 20 μm suppressed the increase of TK in the parental strain (Fig. 4, line 3) and at 4 μm did so in thesodA sodB strain (Fig. 4, line 4). It should be noted that these low levels of paraquat did not significantly inhibit growth in this rich medium. Paraquat increased O2− production, but it did so by diversion of electron flow from useful pathways, and this can complicate interpretation of its effects. For this reason we tested the effect of hyperoxia, anticipating that it should inhibit growth more when the carbon source was ribose than when it was glucose. Fig.5, line 1, represents the growth of AB1157 at 5.5 atm of O2 on glucose, whereasline 2 shows the much slower growth on ribose. It should be noted that growth under ordinary atmospheric conditions was much less affected by switching from glucose to ribose (Fig. 2, lines 1 and 2). If the relative paucity of growth on ribose compared with glucose, imposed by hyperoxia, was attributable to inactivation of TK by O2−, then we should be able to see this inactivation most clearly when de novo protein synthesis was inhibited, and we should be able to prevent the inactivation with a cell-permeant catalyst of the dismutation of O2− (28Batanic-Haberle I. Benov L. Spasojevic I. Fridovich I. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24521-24528Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). The affirmation of these expectations is presented in Fig. 6. Thusbar 4 in Fig. 6 A gives the activity of TK in midlog AB1157 treated with chloramphenicol and kept at 0 °C for 3.5 h. Bar 3 shows the decline in TK, which occurred when the cells were kept at 37.5 °C in the presence of chloramphenicol for that period. Bars 1 and 2illustrate that the extent of TK inactivation under 3.2 atm of O2 was made apparent only when protein synthesis was inhibited (Fig. 6 A, bar 2). Fig. 6 B presents the protection by the SOD mimic MnTM-2-PyP (28Batanic-Haberle I. Benov L. Spasojevic I. Fridovich I. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24521-24528Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). Thus bar set 1is a control showing that the mimic had no effect on TK activity in cells kept on ice in the presence of chloramphenicol Bar set 2 shows that 25 μm MnTM-2-PyP diminished the loss of TK seen in air in the presence of chloramphenicol, whereas bar set 3 shows the profound inactivation of TK under 3.5 atm of O2 and the striking protection provided by the SOD mimic. Hence the inactivation of TK was most likely attributable to O2− and could be seen even in the SOD-replete strain when O2− production was increased by raisingpO2. If inactivation of TK by O2− was limiting growth under hyperoxia, then a strain overproducing TK ∼10-fold, by virtue of a cosmid bearing the TK gene, should have a growth advantage under hyperoxia. In Fig.7, comparison of lines 1 and2 shows that this was the case. It should be noted that under normoxia the TK overproducer actually grew somewhat slower than its parental strain. TK, either as the purified enzyme (Fig.8 A) or in an extract of JI132 (Fig. 8 B), was inactivated when exposed to a photochemical flux of O2− in the presence of fructose-6-phosphate (Fig. 8 A, line 3), and this inactivation was diminished by 10 μg/ml SOD (Fig. 8 A, line 2) and was dependent on the glycol-donating substrate (Fig. 8 A, line 1). The TK activity in an extract of JI132 (Fig. 8 B) was similarly inactivated (Fig. 8 B, line 3) and was similarly protected by 10 μg/ml SOD (Fig. 8 B, line 2). Fig. 8 B,line 1, illustrates the stability of the TK activity in these extracts in the absence of the photochemical flux of O2−. We have previously noted (29Benov L. Fridovich I. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10313-10316Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) that enrichment of growth media with iron relieved some of the phenotypic deficits of the sodA sodB strain. Iron enrichment elevated the levels of [4Fe-4S] containing dehydratases, and we surmised that the oxidative inactivation and reductive repair of these [4Fe-4S] clusters was providing a pathway for the scavenging of O2− and was thus protecting less reparable targets. The data in Fig.9 show that TK is one of those less repairable targets of O2−. It should be noted that growth in iron-enriched medium did not affect the activities of DAHP synthase, dehydroquinate synthase, 5-dehydroquinate dehydrogenase, or shikimate dehydrogenase (data not shown). The blockade of aromatic amino acid biosynthesis imposed by O2− imposes an auxotrophy for these amino acids that was relieved by shikimate. Hence that blockade was in the early steps of the aromatic biosynthetic pathway. None of the enzymes catalyzing the early steps in this pathway was found to be O2−sensitive. Because this pathway begins with the condensation of PEP with E-4-P, and because an intermediate in the TK reaction was already known to be oxidized by O2− with a rate constant of ∼106m−1 s−1 (10Takabe T. Asami S. Akazawa T. Biochemistry. 1980; 19: 3985-3989Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), it appeared possible that the problem might be imposed by this reaction. The sodA sodB strain of E. coli did exhibit a relative deficiency in its ability to use ribose as a carbon source, whereas the ability of the SOD-replete strain to grow on ribose could be diminished by raising O2− production through application of paraquat or hyperoxia. TK activity was low in thesodA sodB strain, whereas there were no differences in glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase or 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase and only a marginally significant difference in transaldolase. Paraquat or hyperoxia lowered the TK activity in the bacteria, and a cell-permeant mimic of SOD activity protected. The inhibition of growth imposed by hyperoxia was lessened by overproduction of TK, and TK activity in either purified form or in crude extracts was inactivated by a photochemical flux of O2− and was protected by SOD. All of these data indicate that the synthesis of E-4-P was compromised by the O2−-TK reaction and that lack of E-4-P prevented the first step of the aromatic pathway. It should be noted that leakage of intermediates from the cells into the medium was tested for and was not observed (data not shown). It is interesting that, although carefully sought after, E-4-P has never been detected in tissue extracts when specific assay methods were used (26Paoletti F. Williams J.F. Horecker B.L. Anal. Biochem. 1979; 95: 250-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 30Williams J.F. Blackmore P.F. Duket C.C. MacLeod J.K. Int. J. Biochem. 1980; 12: 339-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The explanation offered for this failure has been the spontaneous dimerization of this sugar (26Paoletti F. Williams J.F. Horecker B.L. Anal. Biochem. 1979; 95: 250-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 31Blackmore P.F. Williams J.F. MacLeod J.K. FEBS Lett. 1976; 64: 222-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). However, that dimerization has been seen to lower the concentration of E-4-P by only 75% in in vitro tests; so it would not be likely to entirely prevent detection of this sugar. Moreover a dimerization reaction would proceed even less well when the concentration of the monomer was very low. We have noted a toxicity of short chain sugars and have related it to the reactivity of the exposed carbonyl group and to the formation of enediolate tautomers, which can oxidize to very toxic α-β diketones (32Benov L. Fridovich I. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25741-25744Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Hence short chain sugars should be kept at vanishingly low concentrations to prevent this. Tamaritet al. (33Tamarit J. Cabiscol E. Ros J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3027-3032Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar) have examined the proteins damaged in E. coli exposed to oxidative stresses. They identified these proteins by looking for protein carbonyls and did not find transketolase among them. Possibly transketolase escaped their notice because its oxidative inactivation does not generate a carbonyl group. We are grateful to Dr. Karen Draths, who generously provided transketolase mutants of E. coli."

Proteases have been shown to play essential roles in the nervous system, including those of neurite outgrowth (1Monard D. Trends Neurosci. 1988; 11: 541-544Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar), neural degeneration (2Tsirka S.E. Gualandris A. Amaral D.G. Strickland S.

A. 1994; 91: 10300-10304Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). These actions are thought to be mediated by the proteolytic cleavage of zymogen precursors, the activation of specific cell surface receptors, or the degradation of extracellular matrix proteins (4McGuire P.G. Seeds N.W. Neuron. 1990; 4: 633-642Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Neuropsin was cloned from a mouse hippocampal cDNA library using sequences for key regions of the serine protease domain of nerve growth factor (NGF)-γ 1The abbreviations used are: NGF, nerve growth factor; tPA, tissue plasminogen activator; GlcNAc, N-acetylglucosamine; STI, soybean trypsin inhibitor; MCA, 4-methylcoumaryl-7-amide; MSP, myelencephalon-specific protease; r.m.s., root mean square.

In the brain, no NGFγ has been identified so far, though NGFβ is present. Neuropsin is one of the serine proteases highly expressed in the nervous system (6Gschwend T.P. Krueger S.R. Kozlov S.V.

Acta. 1997; 1350: 11-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). The expression of neuropsin is localized at highest concentration in the hippocampus and the amygdala, which are important for acquisition of memory and emotional memory, respectively. This localization is in contrast to that of tissue plasminogen activator (tPA), which is well documented to play a crucial role in the nervous system by mediating plasticity but is distributed more uniformly across the other brain regions and throughout other organs (9Qian Z. Gilbert M.E. Colicos M.A. Kandel E.R. Kuhl D. Nature. 1993; 361: 453-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (644) Google Scholar). Activity-dependent changes in expression of neuropsin have been observed upon direct hippocampal stimulation and induction of kindling, which is a model for epilepsy and neuronal plasticity characterized by the progressive development of electrographic and behavioral seizures (5Chen Z.-L.

A single intraventricular injection of monoclonal antibodies specific to neuropsin reduces or eliminates the epileptic pattern (11Momota Y. Yoshida S. Ito J. Shibata M. Kato K. Sakurai K. Matsumoto K. Shiosaka S. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1998; 10: 760-764Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Moreover, oxidative stress is shown to effect the expression of neuropsin in the limbic areas, which might be related to the disturbance in shock-avoidance learning of mice (12Akita H. Matsuyama T. Iso H. Sugita M. Yoshida S. Brain Res. 1997; 769: 86-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). These activity-dependent changes and the specific localization of neuropsin indicate the involvement of this protease in hippocampal plasticity and its pathogenesis. Knowledge of the three-dimensional structure of neuropsin provides clues to the biological activity of this protease and also is important to the design of inhibitors that might be useful in treatment of pathological conditions such as epilepsy. Neuropsin was over-expressed in baculovirus-infected High Five insect cells, purified, and crystallized as described previously (13Kishi T. Kato M. Shimizu T. Kato K. Matsumoto K. Yoshida Y. Shiosaka S. Hakoshima T. J. Struct. Biol. 1997; 118: 248-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). The resulting sample and the crystallized protein were verified with N-terminal analysis using an Applied Biosystem automatic analyzer 476A. Neuropsin has a putative glycosylation site at Asn95 of the kallikrein loop. Time-of-flight mass spectroscopy with PerSeptive JMS-ELITE matrix-associated laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight indicated its heterogeneous glycosylation. Two-dimensional high performance liquid chromatography mapping (14Tomiya N. Awaya J. Kurono M. Endo S. Arata Y. Takahashi N. Anal. Biochem. 1988; 171: 73-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar) revealed that theN-glycans contained 89% paucimannosidic structures with and without attached fucose residue(s) at the innermost GlcNAc residues but the glycosylation pattern exhibited high heterogeneity as found on many glycoproteins (15Friedrich A. Trends Glycosci. Glycotech. 1996; 40: 101-114Google Scholar). The detailed procedures and obtained structures will be described elsewhere. The crystals belong to space groupP1 (a = 38.15 Å, b = 54.95 Å, c = 64.29 Å, α = 95.72°, β = 90.03°, and γ = 110.29°). X-ray diffraction data were collected with Rigaku imaging plate area-detectors, R-Axis IV and R-Axis IIc, using Cu-Kα radiation and also with a Weissenberg camera at the BL-18B beamline station of the Photon Factory, Tsukuba using 1-Å radiation. Intensities were evaluated with the program DENZO/SCALEPAK (16Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 276: 307-326Crossref Scopus (38617) Google Scholar), which yielded 25,778 independent combined reflections corresponding to 90.7% completeness at 2.1-Å resolution (74.5% in the highest resolution bin), an R merge of 6.0% (19.8%), a mean ratio of intensity, and ς of 8.5 (3.1). Initial phases were calculated by molecular-replacement with the program AMoRe (17Navaza J. Acta Crystallogr. Sec. A. 1994; 50: 157-163Crossref Scopus (5030) Google Scholar) using a search model based on the structure of bovine pancreatic β-trypsin (PDB code 4PTP) (18Finer-Moore J.S. Kossiakoff A.A. Hurley J.H. Earnest T. Stroud R.M. Proteins Struct. Finct. 1992; 12: 203-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Rigid body refinements of the searched model were performed with the program X-PLOR (19Brunger A.T. Krukowski A. Erickson J.W. Acta Crystallogr. Sec. A. 1990; 46: 585-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (600) Google Scholar), followed by density averaging/histogram matching with the program DM (20Cowtan K.D. Main P. Acta Crystallogr. Sec. D. 1996; 52: 43-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). Six regions of insertions and deletions were inspected on the resulting 2Fo − Fc map, which was generated with the program O (21Jones T.A. Zou J.-Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sec. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13014) Google Scholar). The structure was built and refined through alternating cycles using the programs O and X-PLOR, respectively. The kallikrein loop had large but mostly poor density connects to the side chain of Asn95. After several cycles of refinements incorporating solvent water molecules located at the regions other than the kallikrein loop, we defined one residue ofN-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) residue bonded to Asn95, as well as weaker density for additional sugar residues that we have been unable to identify definitively. The residual weak density is extending toward a large solvent channel in the crystal. Two regions were poorly defined in the map. The first is at the loop residues, Arg74 and Asp75, and the second is at the three C-terminal residues. These have uninterpretable densities implying complex disorder. The current structure contains 194 water molecules. The R-factor is 18.6% (an R free of 22.7%) for all reflections to 2.1-Å resolution. The root-mean-square (r.m.s.) deviations from target values are 0.008 Å for bond lengths, 1.535° for bond angles, and 1.139° for the peptide torsion angles. The averaged B-factor is 30.8 Å2. There is no residue in disallowed regions as defined in PROCHECK (22Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar), but 89.4% residues in the most favorable regions and 10.6% residues in the additional allowed regions. Neuropsin consists of fourteen β-strands (designated as β1–β14) that are extensively twisted, two α-helices (designated as α1 and α2), and one short 310-helix (Fig.1 a). Each seven-β-strand forms an antiparallel β-sheet folded in a β-sandwich with a cleft where the catalytic triad (Asp57, His102, and Ser195) is located (Fig. 1, a and b). This overall structure is homologous to those of the chymotrypsin-type serine proteases, which share an identical catalytic mechanism, but among which the substrate specificity varies. Many known structures of these proteases delineate a clear framework, demonstrating that this variety is a function of evolved diversity in the structures of surface loops that surround the substrate-binding site. Because the loops of neuropsin, which contains eight prominent loops (A–H in Fig. 1 a), are conserved in their relative positions with respect to the active site, general themes for their individual functions can be derived. One of the characteristic features of neuropsin is theN-glycosylated loop D that corresponds to the so-called “kallikrein loop.” This loop, having an Asn-X-Ser sequence, is typical for members of the kallikrein family that contains NGFγ, which exhibits relatively high (46%) sequence identity to neuropsin (Fig. 2). Neuropsin, however, forms six disulfide bonds corresponding to those of trypsin with an additional disulfide bond (SS3 between Cys128 and Cys232 in Fig. 1 a) that is missing in members of the kallikrein family. Large differences exist in the loop regions surrounding the substrate-binding site, whereas the core region contains only minor variations. Excluding the insertion and deletion residues, the main-chain atoms of neuropsin superimpose on the corresponding atoms of bovine pancreatic trypsin (18Finer-Moore J.S. Kossiakoff A.A. Hurley J.H. Earnest T. Stroud R.M. Proteins Struct. Finct. 1992; 12: 203-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar), mouse submaxillary gland NGFγ in 7 S NGF (23Bax B. Blundell T.L. Murray-Rust J. McDonald N.Q. Structure (Lond.). 1997; 5: 1275-1285Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), an α2β2γ2 complex of NGF, and pancreatic porcine kallikrein (24Bode W. Chen Z. Bartels K. Kutzbach C. Schmidt-Kastner G. Bartunik H. J. Mol. Biol. 1983; 164: 237-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar) with r.m.s. deviations of 1.26, 1.43, and 1.84 Å, respectively. The geometry of the catalytic triad is highly similar to those of the serine proteases with r.m.s. deviations in a range of 0.2–0.24 Å. Neuropsin has no prominent structural similarity to tPA, showing a high r.m.s. deviation of 2.74 Å for 79 identical residues (37% sequence identity). Enzyme assay using several 4-methylcoumaryl-7-amide (MCA) derivatives of oligopeptides (25Shimizu C. Yoshida S. Shibata M. Kato K. Momota Y. Matsumoto K. Shiosaka T. Midorikawa R. Kamachi T. Kawabe A. Shiosaka S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11189-11196Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) has shown that neuropsin cleaves peptide bonds C-terminal to Arg or Lys. This primary specificity is well interpreted by the S1 pocket, a deep cylindrical pocket that is formed by two loops, G and H, and punctuated at its base by the side chain of Asp189. However, neuropsin has large conformational changes of loop G with maximum displacements of 4.8–5.8 Å compared with those of NGFγ, kallikrein, and trypsin (Fig.3). The conformational changes in neuropsin seem to be caused by the one-residue (Gly186B) deletion in loop G. In addition, loop H of neuropsin also displays large displacements from these proteases because loop H is heavily interacted with loop G in all the proteases. It is noteworthy that loop H of trypsin has a one-residue deletion of the cis proline, Pro219, that is conserved in neuropsin, NGFγ, and kallikrein. This deletion induces a larger displacement of neuropsin loop H from trypsin (4.3 Å) than from NGFγ (3.4 Å) or kallikrein (3.2 Å). Interestingly, the P1 specificity of neuropsin for arginine is comparable with that for lysine. This is in sharp contrast to NGFγ, kallikrein, and trypsin, in which a significant preference for arginine exists. Among key residues of the S1 pocket, Gly226 of neuropsin has relatively large displacements from NGFγ (0.7 Å) and kallikrein (1.2 Å). Alternatively, Ser217 of neuropsin has a relatively large displacement from trypsin (1.3 Å). Compared with NGFγ, the changes of the neuropsin loop structures result in positional displacements (0.4–0.8 Å) of Asp189, Thr190, and His217, which have been reported to form hydrogen bonds to the P1 arginine of NGFβ in 7 S NGF (23Bax B. Blundell T.L. Murray-Rust J. McDonald N.Q. Structure (Lond.). 1997; 5: 1275-1285Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). These local differences may be responsible for the unique P1 specificity of neuropsin. Like other serine proteases, which are activated by cleavage of the bond between Arg15and Ile16, neuropsin tucks the newly formed amino group of Ile16 into the pocket to form multiple hydrogen bonds with the main chains of loop E and to form an ion pair with Asp194 of loop G. The kallikrein loop of neuropsin differs radically from those of NGFγ and kallikrein. In these members of the kallikrein family, the loop was cleaved into the highly mobile nicked chains. In contrast, the loop of neuropsin is packed into an ordered and relatively compact conformation without any nicked site: neuropsin has no arginine or lysine residue in the loop. Recently determined crystal structure (26Timm D.E. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 1418-1425Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) of mouse glandular kallikrein-13 shows an ordered kallikrein loop, but no conformational similarity with the loop of neuropsin. It seems unlikely that the N-glycan bound to Asn95 participates directly in the substrate binding because the GlcNAc residue and the residual density are oriented away from the active site as in members of the kallikrein family. The kallikrein loop of neuropsin overhangs toward the active site cleft with a prominent Pro95D residue, which suggests its role in substrate binding. Interestingly, superposition of neuropsin on porcine pancreatic trypsin complexed with soybean trypsin inhibitor (STI) (27Song H.K. Suh S.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 275: 347-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar) revealed steric clashes between the kallikrein loop of neuropsin and the two STI loops facing toward neuropsin. This was borne out by biochemical experiments in which high molecular weight inhibitors, such as STI or α-antitrypsin, were found to have little effect on the neuropsin activity, whereas low molecular weight inhibitors, such as leupeptin, markedly inhibited the activity. The overhanging kallikrein loop forms a narrow pocket (the S2 site) in which Asp102 is positioned at the base and would restrict the size of the side chain in the P2 position of substrate peptides. This is consistent with the results of a previous enzyme assay (25Shimizu C. Yoshida S. Shibata M. Kato K. Momota Y. Matsumoto K. Shiosaka T. Midorikawa R. Kamachi T. Kawabe A. Shiosaka S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11189-11196Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar), in which high activities of neuropsin were observed for peptide substrates having smaller residues or proline in the P2 positions. It has been well demonstrated by the crystal structure of thrombin complexed withd-Phe-Pro-Arg that loop B of thrombin compresses the S2 site with the inserted residues, Tyr60A and Trp60D, to deduce the P2 specificity of the enzyme for proline (28Bode W. Mayr I. Baumann U. Huber R. Stone S.R. Hofsteenge J. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 3467-3475Crossref PubMed Scopus (823) Google Scholar). Superposition of neuropsin on thrombin shows Pro95D of neuropsin located nearby Tyr60A and Trp60D of thrombin, but no contact between Pro95D and the proline residue of d-Phe-Pro-Arg bound to thrombin, which suggests that the P2 preference for proline may be mediated by the kallikrein loop of neuropsin, instead of loop B of thrombin, but rather weaker than that of thrombin (Fig.4). Phenylalanine at the P2 position remarkably reduces the neuropsin activity, which is one of the major differences from kallikrein and NGFγ. Most striking is the structure of loop F that is similar to that of trypsin rather than NGFγ and kallikrein, where significant conformational changes of loop F from neuropsin occur with large displacements, 5.2 and 6 Å, respectively, accompanied by movements of helix α1 (Fig. 3). Loop F is one of the main elements forming the S3/S4 site. It is notable that this loop has Tyr172, which forms hydrogen bonds with the main chains of loop H and which is conserved in trypsin but is replaced by histidine in NGFγ and kallikrein. This residue has been elucidated to be one of the distal determinant residues for the substrate specificity (29Hedstrom L. Perona J.J. Rutter W.J. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 8757-8763Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Moreover, Gly174, which is conserved in neuropsin and trypsin, is one of the key residues for the loop F structure because this residue is an essential component of the type-II reverse turn, YPGK at 172–175. It should be pointed out that the disulfide bond SS3, which is conserved in trypsin as already mentioned, may contribute to the conformational resemblance of loop F with that of trypsin through contacts with strand β13 that associated with the C-terminal β-strand of loop F, β11. It is remarkable that the above differences in the loop F may also be correlated with the conformational differences in the kallikrein loops. In NGFγ and kallikrein, the highly mobile kallikrein loops heavily interact with loop F although the kallikrein loop of neuropsin has no direct interaction with loop F, as it does with loop D of trypsin. One of the interesting consequences of these conformational characteristics in loops D and F is that the S3/S4 site of neuropsin is similar to that of trypsin rather than NGFγ. The aromatic rings of Trp215, Tyr172, and His99 provide a shallow but wide hydrophobic depression for the S3/S4 site as in trypsin and could explain the high activities of neuropsin observed for synthetic tripeptide substrates having hydrophobic residues in the P3 position. Moreover, in neuropsin, Lys175 of loop F is projected toward the S3/S4 site (Fig. 1 b), whereas Lys175 of NGFγ is projected away from the S3/S4 site. It is interesting that Lys175 may play a role in the P3/P4 interaction with the substrates. Actually, one of the cleavage sites of fibronectin (25Shimizu C. Yoshida S. Shibata M. Kato K. Momota Y. Matsumoto K. Shiosaka T. Midorikawa R. Kamachi T. Kawabe A. Shiosaka S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11189-11196Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar), which is an extracellular matrix protein exhibiting strong proteolytic sensitivity for neuropsin, had the N-terminal sequence of Asp-Val-Arg, whose acidic residue at the P3 position may interact with Lys175. A tripeptide substrate preferred for thrombin, Val-Pro-Arg-MCA, has been found to exhibit the highest sensitivity for neuropsin to date. However, poor structural homology between neuropsin and thrombin is evident from the large r.m.s. deviation of 2.7 Å for 78 identical residues. Moreover, thrombin cleaves Val-Pro-Arg-MCA much faster (33-fold) than Phe-Ser-Arg-MCA, which is one of the preferred substrates of trypsin, whereas the activities of neuropsin for these substrates are comparable. In addition, thrombin also exhibits a significant preference for arginine at the P1 position, but no such preference was observed for neuropsin, as described above. These results, together with structural differences of several loops, verify the unique substrate specificity of neuropsin, even if the P2 preference for proline is analogous to thrombin. Compared with the subsite preferences on the N-terminal side of the scissile bond, little is known about subsite preferences on the C-terminal side at present. However, a shallow bowl formed by Cys42, Ile41, and Leu40 of strand β3 seems to provide a hydrophobic S1′ site (Fig. 1 b). The shape of the substrate-binding surface and the surface electrostatic distribution of neuropsin display several differences in details from other serine proteases. One of the pronounced characteristics is the rim of the S1 pocket, where acidic residues, Asp218 and Glu149, expose the side chains to the solvent region. Glu97 of the kallikrein loop also is projected from the surface. These characteristics may be related to the specificity that are distinct from those of other proteases. Neuropsin exhibits weak proteolytic activities against gelatin and collagen but effectively cleaves fibronectin, as already mentioned. By changing the extracellular environment, neuropsin may exert its limbic effects. It is an interesting question whether neuropsin could process NGFβ precursor and form 7 S NGF instead of NGFγ. In 7 S NGF, the active site of NGFγ was occupied by the C-terminal Arg118 of the mature NGFβ, as a cleaved product, with extensive interactions of the large nicked kallikrein loop with the C-terminal regions and β-strand of NGFβ. Docking studies suggest that neuropsin would lose most of these interactions although the smaller residues, Thr117and Ala116, of NGFβ could fit to the S2 and S3 sites of neuropsin. In addition, the small cavity of NGFγ for Ala116 of NGFβ is missing in neuropsin. Moreover, Lys192, which is located at the rim of the active site of NGFγ and forms hydrogen bonds to main chain carbonyls of Thr117 and Lys74 of NGFβ, is replaced by Gln192 in neuropsin. In 7 S NGF, a zinc ion was located at the interface between NGFγ and NGFα to stabilize the complex. This coordination is also lost when NGFγ is replaced by neuropsin because zinc-coordinated His217 and Glu222 of NGFγ are replaced by serine and lysine in neuropsin. Taken together, these results suggest that neuropsin is incapable of forming 7 S NGF, even if neuropsin could process the NGFβ precursor. However, this will require further investigation. In addition to neuropsin, three other serine proteases have been reported to be more highly expressed in the central nervous system than in most peripheral tissues. These include myelencephalon (MSP)-specific protease (7Scarisbrick I.A. Towner M.D. Isackson P.J. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 8156-8168Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), neurosin (8Yamashiro K. Tsuruoka N. Kodama S. Tsujimoto M. Yamamura Y. Tanaka T. Nakazato H. Yamagichi N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1350: 11-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar), and neurotrypsin (6Gschwend T.P. Krueger S.R. Kozlov S.V. Wolfer D.P. Sonderegger P. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 1997; 9: 207-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). MSP and neurosin exhibit sequence identities to neuropsin of 48 and 46%, respectively. Neurotrypsin, which is a multidomain serine protease whose expression is most prominent in the cerebral cortex, hippocampus, and amygdala, has a protease domain exhibiting 33% sequence identity to neuropsin. Sequence alignments with neuropsin indicate that these proteases would have different structures of surface loops surrounding the substrate-binding site. Remarkably, loop D of either of these proteases has no N-glycosylation site and no inserted residues. This lack of a kallikrein loop would result in their P2 specificities differing from that of neuropsin. Moreover, loop G of MSP and neurosin has no one-residue deletion, which causes significant structural changes of loops G and H forming the S1 pocket. Alternatively, compared with neuropsin, neurotrypsin has a three-residue insertion in loop G and a one-residue deletion in loop H. These differences would endow these other proteases with substrate specificities different from that of neuropsin. In conclusion, many aspects of neuropsin structure and function reveal that this hippocampal serine protease displays chimeric structural features of trypsin and NGFγ with novel substrate specificity. These findings could give a clue to the structure-based drug design useful in treatment of pathological conditions such as epilepsy and also useful in analyzing the processes of synaptic plasticity.

https://openalex.org/W2009650953,"It has been previously reported that heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) oligomerizes at high temperatures and displays concomitantly a novel chaperone activity (Yonehara, M., Minami, Y., Kawata, Y., Nagai, J., and Yahara, I. (1996) J. Biol. Chem., 271, 2641–2645). In order to better define these oligomerization properties at high temperatures and to know whether they are influenced by modulators of Hsp90 function, heat-induced oligomerization of highly purified dimeric Hsp90 has been investigated over a wide range of temperature and protein concentrations by native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and size exclusion chromatography. Whereas below 50 °C, the dimeric form is maintained over a large range of concentrations, at the critical temperature of 50 °C, a sharp transition from dimeric to higher order oligomeric species takes place within minutes, in a highly ordered process, suggesting that a conformational change, leading to the appearance of a new oligomerization site, occurs in Hsp90 dimer. Moreover, at and above the critical temperature, the extent of oligomerization increases with Hsp90 concentration.Formation of high order oligomers at high temperatures is sensitive to modulators of Hsp90 function. ATP and geldanamycin, both known to bind to the same pocket of Hsp90, are inhibitors of this process, whereas molybdate, vanadate, and Nonidet P-40, which are thought to increase surface hydrophobicity of the protein, are activators. Thus, oligomerization of Hsp90 at high temperatures may be mediated through hydrophobic interactions that are hindered by ligands and favored by transition metal oxyanions.The fact that the heat-induced oligomerization of Hsp90 is affected by specific ligands that modulate its properties also suggests that this process may be involved in cell protection during heat shock.

A wide range of adverse conditions, such as increasing temperature, trigger the synthesis of stress or heat shock proteins (Hsps), 1The abbreviations used are: Hsp, heat shock protein; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis.1The abbreviations used are: Hsp, heat shock protein; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. which participate in an essential defense mechanism, present in species from bacteria to human, that consists of a stress response and acquired stress tolerance (1Morimoto R.I. Tissieres A. Georgopoulos Morimoto R.I. Tissieres A. Georgopoulos C. Stress Proteins in Biology and Medicine. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1990: 1-36Google Scholar, 2Morimoto R.I. Tissieres A. Georgopoulos C. Morimoto R.I. Tissieres A. Georgopoulos C.

Genet. 1993; 27: 437-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (1850) Google Scholar). Even in the absence of heat induction, Hsps and their constitutively expressed cognate counterparts perform vital functions as molecular chaperones. During and after heat shock, Hsps act by preventing catastrophic protein aggregation, by assisting refolding of damaged proteins, or by targeting them toward a proteolytic pathway (4Gething M.J. Sambrook J. Nature. 1992; 355: 33-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (3565) Google Scholar,5Ellis R.J. Cell Stress Chaperones. 1996; 1: 155-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Among Hsps, the highly conserved Hsp90, although dispensable inEscherichia coli, is essential for viability in eukaryotes (6Borkovich K.A. Farrelly F.W. Finkelstein D.B. Taulien J. Lindquist S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 3919-3930Crossref PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar, 7Cutforth T. Rubin G.M. Cell. 1994; 77: 1027-1036Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). Hsp90 constitutes 1–2% of cytosolic proteins, and this level further increases when cells are exposed to heat shock. Indeed, very high levels of Hsp90 are necessary for growth of yeast cells at extreme temperatures (6Borkovich K.A. Farrelly F.W. Finkelstein D.B. Taulien J. Lindquist S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 3919-3930Crossref PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar) and contribute to efficient reactivation of heat damaged proteins (8Nathan D.F. Harju Vos M. Lindquist S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 12949-129956Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). At normal temperatures, the abundant Hsp90 seems to be only required for a specific subset of cellular proteins that need assistance to reach a native conformation (9Pratt W.B. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1997; 37: 297-326Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10Pratt W.B. Toft D. Endocr. Rev. 1997; 18: 306-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (1514) Google Scholar, 11Nathan D.F. Lindquist S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3917-3925Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). Therefore, as yet, there is little evidence indicating a general chaperone function for Hsp90 in vivo (8Nathan D.F. Harju Vos M. Lindquist S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 12949-129956Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar), and the requirement of high levels of Hsp90 in heat shock conditions is not fully understood. In vitro experiments with reticulocyte lysate and genetic experimentsin vivo indicate that Hsp90 is required to assist the conformational maturation of specific targets, such as, for example, steroid hormone receptors and protein kinases, in an ATP-dependent fashion and in concert with other chaperones, such as Hsp70, Hsp40, immunophillins, and p23 (10Pratt W.B. Toft D. Endocr. Rev. 1997; 18: 306-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (1514) Google Scholar, 12Bohen S.P. Yamamoto K.R. Morimoto R.I. Tissieres A. Georgopoulos C. The Biology of Heat Shock Proteins and Molecular Chaperones. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1994: 313-334Google Scholar). Moreover, it has been proposed that depending on the nature of the nucleotide, Hsp90 may acquire two different functional states (13Sullivan W. Stensgard B. Caucutt G. Bartha B. McMahon N. Alnemri E. Litwack G. Toft D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8007-8012Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). However, ATP hydrolysis was repeatedly found to be unnecessary for Hsp90 chaperone function in vitro (14Miyata Y. Yahara I. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 7042-7047Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Wiech H. Buchner J. Zimmermann R. Jakob U. Nature. 1992; 358: 169-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar, 16Buchner J. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 10-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar). Recent crystallographic studies have shown the presence of a specific, low affinity ATP/ADP binding site in the N-terminal domain of Hsp90 (17Prodromou C. Roe S.M. O'Brien R. Ladbury J.E. Piper P.W. Pearl L.H. Cell. 1997; 90: 65-75Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1098) Google Scholar). This ATP/ADP binding site, which has been found to be related to that of DNA gyrase B, also binds geldanamycin, a naturally occurring antitumor antibiotic (18Stebbins C.E. Russo A.A. Schneider C. Rosen N. Hartl U.F. Pavletich N. Cell. 1997; 89: 239-250Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1222) Google Scholar), suggesting that geldanamycin blocks Hsp90 action through binding to the nucleotide site. Indeed, in the case of steroid receptors, geldanamycin not only accelerates receptors degradation but, most importantly, abolishes their ability to bind the specific hormone (19Segnitz B. Gehring U. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18694-18701Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). The discovery of the Hsp90 ATP/geldanamycin binding site prompted further investigations of in vitrochaperone activities of Hsp90, leading to the proposal that Hsp90 bears two independent chaperone sites differing in substrate specificity and ATP dependence (20Young J.C. Schneider C. Hartl F.U. FEBS Lett. 1997; 418: 139-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 21Scheibel T. Weikl T. Buchner J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 1495-1499Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). Moreover, mutations of residues implicated in ATP binding and hydrolysis abolish the ATPase activity in vitro and disrupt Hsp90 function in vivo (22Panaretou B. Prodomou C. Rose S.M. O'Brien R. Ladbury J.E. Piper P.W. Pearl L.H. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4829-4836Crossref PubMed Scopus (610) Google Scholar). A large body of evidence suggests that all of the members of the Hsp90 family, which in vertebrates includes Hsp90α, Hsp90β, and glucose-regulated protein 94, exist as homodimeric species in crude extracts or in purified preparations (23Welch W.J.

Nevertheless, some Hsp90β has been found in monomeric form (27Minami Y. Kawasaki H. Miyata Y. Suzuki K. Yahara I. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 10099-10103Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 29Nemoto T. Sato N. Biochem. J. 1998; 330: 989-995Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), and a tendency of Hsp90 to self-associate has been reported when purified preparations or whole cytosols were analyzed (29Nemoto T. Sato N. Biochem. J. 1998; 330: 989-995Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 30Jakob U. Meyer I. Bugl H. André S. Bardwell J.C.A. Buchner J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14412-14419Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Because Hsp90 and other chaperones are heat shock proteins that have evolved to function at high temperatures, changes in structural organization of these proteins following increase in temperature are of particular interest. Such changes have been shown to occur for Hsp90 above 49 °C, the temperature at which the protein oligomerizes (31Lanks K.W. J. Cell. Physiology. 1989; 140: 601-607Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar,32Lanks K.W. London E. Long-Yu D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 184: 394-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar) and concomitantly exhibits a newly acquired chaperone activity (33Yonehara M. Minami Y. Kawata Y. Nagai J. Yahara I. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2641-2645Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Because this finding may have implications on the function of Hsp90 in thermoprotection, it was important to further characterize this heat-induced oligomerization process and to determine the effects of ligands known to modulate Hsp90 activity. Results reported in this study show that oligomerization of Hsp90 occurs at a critical temperature of 50 °C regardless of the concentration and is sensitive to modulators of Hsp90 activity, such as ATP, ADP, geldanamycin, and transition metal oxyanions. Decapitated 12–14-day-old chicken embryos were washed twice with PBS and once with Buffer A (20 mm triethanolamine, 50 mm potassium acetate, 2% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 2 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 mm EDTA, pH 7.8) at 4 °C. The buffer was removed, and the embryos were homogenized in 1.5 volume (w/v) of Buffer A containing protease inhibitors (15 μg/ml leupeptin, 15 μg/ml antipain, and 15 μg/ml aprotinin). The homogenate was centrifuged for 15 min at 600 × g, and the supernatant, recovered after a 105,000 × gcentrifugation (45 min at 4 °C), was aliquoted and stored at −80 °C. Cytosol contained 15–20 mg/ml protein. IgG fraction purified from BF4 ascites (34Joab I. Radanyi C. Renoir J.M. Buchou T. Catelli M.G. Binart N. Mester J. Baulieu E.E. Nature. 1984; 308: 850-853Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar) was coupled to divinyl sulfone-activated Sepharose 4B as described (35Cornillot J.D. Caron M. Joubert-Caron R. Bladier D. Int. J. Biochem. 1992; 24: 1585-1589Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). 2 mg of BF4 were immobilized per g of Sepharose 4B. BF4 antibody recognizes specifically Hsp90α. 2M. G. Catelli, unpublished results. The cytosol was thawed, centrifuged at 4000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, and mixed with solid KCl (to a final concentration of 400 mm). The cytosol was loaded on the immunoaffinity gel equilibrated with Buffer A containing 400 mm KCl. The column, washed with 5 volumes of the same buffer, was eluted with 43 mm diethylamine buffer, pH 10.5, as described (25Radanyi C. Renoir J.M. Sabbah M. Baulieu E.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 2568-2573Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The fractions immediately brought to pH 7.5 by addition of 1 mKH2PO4, were pooled and concentrated by ultrafiltration using the AMICON system. The sedimentation coefficient, Stokes radius, and M r of BF4-purified chicken Hsp90 were determined as previously reported (25Radanyi C. Renoir J.M. Sabbah M. Baulieu E.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 2568-2573Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). UV spectra of purified Hsp90 gave an A 280/260 ratio of 1.8, suggesting that the protein was nucleotide free. Estrogen receptor binding activity of purified Hsp90 was tested as reported (36Sabbah M. Radanyi C. Redeuilh G. Baulieu E.E. Biochem. J. 1996; 314: 205-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Size exclusion chromatography, using an FPLC system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), was carried out at 4 °C on Superose 6 or Superose 12 10/30 columns equilibrated with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.65. Elution was performed using the same buffer at a flow rate of 0.2 ml/min. The eluted proteins were detected by the UV absorbance at 280 nm. The columns were calibrated with high and low molecular mass calibration kit from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. The standards used were thyroglobulin (669 kDa), ferritin (440 kDa), catalase (232 kDa), aldolase (158 kDa), bovine serum albumin (67 kDa), and chymotrypsinogen A (25 kDa). Blue dextran and potassium bichromate were used to determine the void volume and the total volume, respectively. SDS-PAGE and silver staining were performed on a Phast system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The molecular mass calibration kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) included phosphorylase b (94 kDa), bovine serum albumin (67 kDa), ovalbumin (43 kDa), carbonic anhydrase (30 kDa), soybean trypsin inhibitor (20 kDa), and α-lactalbumin (14.4 kDa). Native PAGE was performed at 4 °C on Multiphore II (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) using 10% polyacrylamide Clean gel, 375 mm Tris buffer, pH 8.9. A calibration kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) containing thyroglobulin (669 kDa), ferritin (440 kDa), catalase (232 kDa), lactate dehydrogenase (140 kDa), and bovine serum albumin (67 kDa) was used to estimate the apparent molecular mass of proteins according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Scanning of silver stained bands was performed on a Omni media Scanner apparatus using BioImage software (Millipore). Hsp90 samples resolved on native PAGE were electrotransferred to nitrocellulose. Air-dried filters were incubated 2 h in 10% nonfat dry milk in PBS, 0.05% Tween 20 (PBST), washed with PBST, incubated for 2 h with the anti-Hsp90 antibodies Ab119 (37Lees-Miller S.P. Anderson C.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 2431-2437Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (1:4000) or D7α (28Meng X. Devin J. Sullivan W.P. Toft D. Baulieu E.E. Catelli M.G. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 1677-1687Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (1:4000), washed with PBST, incubated for 1 h with anti-rabbit or anti-mouse antibodies, washed with PBST, and revealed utilizing ECL (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). In standard method, 1 μg of Hsp90 in a final volume of 8 μl of 300 mm Tris, pH 8.8, was incubated at different temperatures for 20 min and then immediately cooled on ice (30 min at 4 °C) and subjected to native PAGE. Hsp90 samples (0.1 mg/ml incubated for 20 min at 50 °C and centrifuged at 105,000 × g) were devoid of precipitating material. Effects of geldanamycine, ATP, ADP, ammonium molybdate, sodium orthovanadate, and Nonidet P-40 on Hsp90 heat-induced oligomerization were tested as follows: Hsp90 samples were mixed with the indicated concentration of each compound and kept at 4 °C for 90 min before incubation at various temperatures. Time course experiments of Hsp90 oligomerization at a given temperature were performed using the Robocycler gradient 40 temperature cycler (Stratagene), which allows simultaneous transfer of 40 samples from the 4 °C block to the hot block. Well-to-well temperature uniformity in the block is of ±0.25 °C. At the indicated times, samples were rapidly put on ice. The same apparatus allowed the use of a precise 8-point temperature gradient in the same block. It has been previously reported that purified Hsp90, when incubated above 49 °C, oligomerizes and displays a concomitant novel chaperone activity (33Yonehara M. Minami Y. Kawata Y. Nagai J. Yahara I. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2641-2645Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). In order to better define the oligomerization properties of Hsp90 at high temperatures and to know whether this process is influenced by modulators of Hsp90 function, such as ATP, geldanamycin, molybdate, vanadate, and Nonidet P-40, heat-induced oligomerization of highly purified Hsp90 has been investigated in several conditions and in the presence or the absence of these modulators. Hsp90 α has been purified to homogeneity from chick embryos by a single immunoaffinity step. It gives a single band in SDS-PAGE, as shown in Fig. 1 A, and appears to be 99.5% pure by densitometric analysis (data not shown). A sedimentation coefficient of 6.2 s, a Stokes radius of ∼6.8 nm, and aM r of 178,000 confirmed a previous report on the dimeric structure of BF4-immunopurified chicken Hsp90 (25Radanyi C. Renoir J.M. Sabbah M. Baulieu E.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 2568-2573Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). When the same preparation was analyzed by native PAGE, a band of apparent molecular mass of about 184 kDa was obtained (Fig. 1 B and Ref. 27Minami Y. Kawasaki H. Miyata Y. Suzuki K. Yahara I. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 10099-10103Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, purified chicken Hsp90 was able to bind cytosolic or purified estrogen receptor as already described for mammalian Hsp90 (36Sabbah M. Radanyi C. Redeuilh G. Baulieu E.E. Biochem. J. 1996; 314: 205-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), indicating that at least the steroid receptor binding property of Hsp90 is preserved after immunoaffinity purification (data not shown). Purified Hsp90 was incubated for 20 min at different temperatures and then analyzed by native PAGE. As shown in Fig.2 A, Hsp90 remains dimeric in the temperature range of 37–45 °C. However, incubation at 50 °C leads to the appearance of well defined oligomeric forms that are shifted to even higher molecular mass oligomers at 55 and 60 °C, as indicated by the smear at the top of the gel and the progressive disappearance of the dimeric species. Experiments shown in Fig.2 B, including comparison with the migration of standard proteins indicated that in addition to the dimer, at least four different oligomeric forms, with apparent molecular masses compatible with those of the trimer, tetramer, pentamer, and hexamer, were detected. The presence of odd-numbered oligomers implies that dissociation of dimers takes place (see below). In order to confirm that these oligomers were also present in solution before electrophoresis, Hsp90 was analyzed by size exclusion chromatography. Fig. 2 C shows that in contrast with Hsp90 incubated at 37 °C, which elutes as an asymmetric dimer and shows the classical profile (23Welch W.J. Feramisco J.R. J. Biol.

Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 1677-1687Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), Hsp90 incubated at 50 °C elutes as a mixture of different oligomeric species, as indicated by the wide peak obtained. To determine the temperature at which the transition between the dimer and the higher order oligomers occurs, Hsp90 was incubated at different temperatures between 45 and 52 °C with a 1 °C increment and then submitted to native PAGE. As shown in Fig.3 A, whereas Hsp90 remains dimeric up to 49 °C, oligomerization occurred at 50 °C. This temperature is defined here as the critical temperature. Disappearance of the dimers into higher oligomers, as monitored by densitometry, occurred in a very narrow range of temperatures and followed a sigmoidal pattern (Fig. 3 B). The critical temperature of 50 °C that defines the transition from dimers to higher order oligomers was found to be the same at low (0.1 mg/ml) and high (7.5 mg/ml) concentrations of Hsp90 (data not shown), indicating that temperature and not concentration induces oligomerization. In order to know whether the heat-induced oligomerization state of Hsp90 (i.e. the abundance of high versuslower order oligomers) is dependent on its concentration, the effects of increasing concentration of Hsp90 on the oligomerization state, below and above the critical temperature of 50 °C, have been determined. As shown in Fig.4 A, increasing the concentration of Hsp90 at 55 °C affects the degree of self-association, and at low concentrations, low molecular mass oligomers are present, whereas at higher concentrations, a shift from low to higher molecular mass oligomers occurs. By contrast, below the critical temperature, only Hsp90 dimers are present for concentration up to 14 mg/ml (Fig. 4 A) and even at 20 mg/ml (data not shown). This is confirmed by size exclusion chromatography, in which, after incubation at 55 °C, highly concentrated Hsp90 elutes near the void volume, whereas at low concentrations, Hsp90 elutes between 440 and 669 kDa (Fig. 4 B). Previous studies have shown that Hsp90 interactions with target and auxiliary proteins are affected by several low molecular weight modulators (10Pratt W.B. Toft D. Endocr. Rev. 1997; 18: 306-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (1514) Google Scholar). Among them, the antibiotic-antitumor agent geldanamycin is a specific inhibitor of Hsp90 function that binds to the same pocket as ATP or ADP in the N-terminal region of the protein (17Prodromou C.

Chem. 1997; 272: 18694-18701Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). ATP, in turn, has recently been shown to modulate the chaperone activity of the N-terminal region of HSP90 (21Scheibel T. Weikl T. Buchner J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 1495-1499Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). On the other hand, molybdate and analogous transition metal oxyanions, such as vanadate, that bind to the Hsp90 dimer with low affinity (38Soti C. Radics L. Yahara I. Csermely P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 255: 611-617Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), have been shown to stabilize the interaction between Hsp90 and steroid receptors (10Pratt W.B. Toft D. Endocr. Rev. 1997; 18: 306-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (1514) Google Scholar), and non-ionic detergent Nonidet P-40 has been shown to enhance the binding of Hsp90 to p23 (13Sullivan W. Stensgard B. Caucutt G. Bartha B. McMahon N. Alnemri E. Litwack G. Toft D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8007-8012Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). We therefore investigated the effects of these modulators on heat-induced oligomerization of Hsp90. As shown in Fig.5, geldanamycin and ATP are powerful inhibitors of heat-induced oligomerization of Hsp90. Almost full inhibition is obtained at a concentration of 4 μm (Fig.5, lane 3) and 8 mm (lane 4) for geldanamycin and ATP, respectively. ADP was also an inhibitor of Hsp90 heat-induced oligomerization, although with lower efficiency than ATP (data not shown). These results suggest that ATP, ADP, and geldanamycin inhibit the heat-induced oligomerization by stabilizing a dimeric structure of Hsp90 less sensitive to heat. Indeed, as shown in Fig. 5, although the dimer has almost completely disappeared in favor of higher oligomeric species at 55 °C (lane 7), it is still present with geldanamycin and ATP (lanes 8 and 9,respectively), supporting the hypothesis of dimer protection by these compounds from temperature-induced oligomerization. In contrast with ATP, ADP, and geldanamycin, molybdate and Nonidet P-40 promote the formation of high molecular mass oligomers, as shown in Fig. 5,lanes 5 and 6, respectively. Because molybdate was efficient in promoting oligomerization of Hsp90 at high temperatures, it was of interest to know whether it affected the critical temperature. As shown in Fig. 6, in the presence of molybdate, oligomerization occurred at 47 °C, 3 °C lower than in its absence (compare Fig. 6, A andB). Thus, molybdate seems to act by favoring a dimeric structure of Hsp90 more prone to oligomerization in such a way that oligomerization of the protein is induced at even lower temperatures. The same effect was observed with vanadate, another modulator of Hsp90 interactions. As shown in Fig. 7, at the nonpermissive temperature of 49 °C, where Hsp90 is stable as a dimer (lane 0), the presence of molybdate (Fig. 7 A) or vanadate (Fig. 7 B) induced oligomerization of the protein. Concomitantly to this oligomerization, however, Hsp90 species migrating faster than the dimer were also detected (see arrows in Fig.7). Such faster migrating species behave in native PAGE similarly to Hsp90 mutants, with a very short deletion in the C-terminal region that cannot dimerize (28Meng X. Devin J. Sullivan W.P. Toft D. Baulieu E.E. Catelli M.G. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 1677-1687Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Figure 7Effect of concentrations of transition metals on Hsp90 heat-induced oligomerization. Hsp90 samples preincubated for 90 min at 4 °C with the indicated concentration of molybdate (A) or vanadate (B) were induced to oligomerize by heating at 49 °C for 20 min and then analyzed by native PAGE. Thearrows indicate the appearance of monomeric species.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Because oligomers seem to be composed of even- and odd-numbered species and because, in the presence of transition metal oxyanions, Hsp90 species migrating faster than the dimer appeared, it was important to know whether these fast migrating species were the result of Hsp90 degradation at high temperatures, or of the dissociation of dimers into monomers. As shown in Fig.8, B and C,immunoblots of Hsp90 treated with vanadate and incubated at 49 °C, using two antibodies directed against N- and C-terminal Hsp90 epitopes, reveal intact monomeric Hsp90. Furthermore, size exclusion chromatography (Fig. 8 D) shows not only the presence of high molecular mass oligomers and the dimer, as expected, but also a shoulder corresponding to the monomeric form of Hsp90, confirming the tendency of the protein to dissociate into monomers under the conditions used. This is in agreement with the fact that in native PAGE, in addition to dimers, tetramers, and hexamers, odd-numbered oligomers, such as trimers and pentamers, are observed, indicating the formation of monomeric species during heat-induced oligomerization. To know whether transient monomeric species may be detected in the absence of molybdate and vanadate as soon as oligomer formation occurs, a time course analysis of Hsp90 heat-induced oligomerization has been performed. As shown in Fig. 9, whether at 50 or at 55 °C, where oligomers begin to appear at 4 min at 50 °C and as early as 1 min at 55 °C, monomers could not be detected. The predominance of even-numbered oligomers at the beginning of the time course suggests that the kinetically preferred process is the self-association of dimeric species. Nevertheless, the progressive increase of odd-numbered oligomers at a later stage, so that even- and odd-numbered oligomers become almost equally represented by 20 min, still argues in favor of a slower heat-induced reaction consisting in dissociation of dimers and assembly of monomers onto larger species. The results presented here describe the heat-induced oligomerization properties of Hsp90 and the influence of specific ligands (ATP, ADP, and geldanamycin), transition metal oxyanions (molybdate and vanadate), and the detergent Nonidet P-40 on such properties. It appears that at the critical temperature of 50 °C, Hsp90 oligomerizes in a well ordered fashion into several species going from trimers to high molecular mass oligomers. The fact that the extent of Hsp90 oligomerization depends on protein concentration at and above the critical temperature, indicates that this oligomerization is induced by temperature and not by protein concentration. Because at low temperatures Hsp90 is stable as a dimer, its rapid disappearance above 50 °C to form oligomers may be the result of denaturation of the protein. In fact, it has already been suggested that thermal unfolding occurs around these temperatures leading to aggregation of the protein (30Jakob U. Meyer I. Bugl H. André S. Bardwell J.C.A. Buchner J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14412-14419Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 39Scheibel T. Neuhofen S. Weikl T. Mayr C. Reinstein J. Vogel P.D. Buchner J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18608-18613Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). A disordered process of aggregation of Hsp90 under the conditions used in this work can be ruled out because formation of oligomers is an extremely ordered process, giving rise to well defined molecular mass species, as shown by the resolution of the different oligomeric species in native PAGE. Moreover, high molecular mass oligomers do not precipitate but remain in solution, as shown by gel filtration chromatography. Most importantly, formation of oligomers at high temperatures is sensitive to specific ligands modulating Hsp90 function, which either promote or inhibit this process. Thus, heat-induced oligomerization of Hsp90 may be regarded as an intrinsic and specific feature of this protein. Because Hsp90 is known to be a stable dimer resistant to dissociation by drastic conditions, such as high salt concentration and chaotropic agents (25Radanyi C. Renoir J.M. Sabbah M. Baulieu E.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 2568-2573Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the formation of trimers and pentamers during self-association of the protein was surprising and implied the formation of monomeric species. In fact, molecular forms comprising monomers, dimers, trimers, and tetramers have also been found with Hsp90 purified from Neurospora crassa cultures incubated at 48 °C (40Freitag D.G. Ouimet P.M. Girvitz T.L. Kapoor M. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 10221-10229Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Although monomeric species were not detected when Hsp90 was induced to oligomerize alone at high temperatures, these forms appeared when Hsp90 was induced to oligomerize after incubation with transition metal oxyanions, suggesting that oligomer formation seems to be, at least in part, associated with a concomitant formation of Hsp90 monomer. Nevertheless, this dissociation is not the key event in Hsp90 oligomerization, because in the first minutes of the process, even-numbered oligomers are the main species observed; the odd-numbered oligomers only appear later. This is in agreement with previous data indicating that within minutes, Hsp90 oligomerizes into tetramers and hexamers at high temperatures (33Yonehara M. Minami Y. Kawata Y. Nagai J. Yahara I. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2641-2645Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the even-numbered species seem to be active in binding and chaperoning unfolded proteins (33Yonehara M. Minami Y. Kawata Y. Nagai J. Yahara I. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2641-2645Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). 3A. Chadli, unpublished results. Altogether, these observations suggest that heat-induced oligomerization of Hsp90 is the result of self-association of dimeric species and that formation of monomers and their subsequent incorporation into oligomers is a secondary event. Because Hsp90 is stable as a dimer even at high concentrations, a conformational change appears to be necessary for oligomerization to occur at the critical temperature. This conformational change should lead to the unmasking, in the dimer at high temperatures, of an oligomerization site that is absent in the dimer at low temperatures, giving rise to new protein-protein interactions and new quaternary structures. The fact that the degree of oligomerization is concentration-dependent at the critical temperature suggests that at high temperatures, oligomers growing up as the Hsp90 concentration increases hold out clusters of sites that are more effective at binding and chaperoning. Whether the oligomerization site(s) is directly involved in chaperoning remains to be determined. Because this oligomerization occurs at high temperatures, hydrophobic interactions may be involved. This is in agreement with previous observations indicating that temperature increase leads to an increase in surface hydrophobicity of Hsp90 (41Yamamoto M. Takahashi Y. Inano K. Horigome T. Sugano H. J. Biochem. 1991; 110: 141-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) and with a recent report on glucose-regulated protein 94 suggesting a temperature-dependent conformational change accompanied by enhanced solvent accessibility to a hydrophobic binding site (42Wearsch P.A. Voglino L. Nicchitta C.V. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 5709-5719Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). In this work, modulators of Hsp90 function were found to interfere with heat-induced self-association of this protein. Geldanamycin, ATP, and ADP appear to be inhibitors of the process by stabilizing a dimeric structure of Hsp90 less prone to oligomerization. This is suggested by the fact that higher temperatures are needed for oligomerization when Hsp90 has been preincubated with these ligands. This interpretation is in agreement with a recent report showing that the melting temperature of the Hsp90 is shifted to a higher temperature in the Hsp90-geldanamycin complex relative to Hsp90 alone (43Garnier C. Protasevich I. Gilli R. Tsvetkov P. Lobachov V. Peyrot V. Briand C. Makarov A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 249: 197-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). On the contrary, molybdate and vanadate seem to lower the energy required for oligomer formation in such a way that heat-induced oligomerization of Hsp90 occurs at lower temperatures. The transition metal oxyanions may act by favoring a dimeric state of Hsp90 that is more prone to heat-induced oligomerization. Increase in surface hydrophobicity of Hsp90 is likely to be involved in this facilitated heat-induced formation of oligomeric species, because Nonidet P-40, which has similar effects on Hsp90 oligomerization, is also known to increase its surface hydrophobicity (32Lanks K.W. London E. Long-Yu D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 184: 394-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). This is in agreement with a recent report indicating that in the presence of ATP, Hsp90 becomes more hydrophilic, whereas in the presence of molybdate or Nonidet P-40, it is more hydrophobic (13Sullivan W. Stensgard B. Caucutt G. Bartha B. McMahon N. Alnemri E. Litwack G. Toft D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8007-8012Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). In conclusion, the fact that heat-induced oligomerization of Hsp90 is sensitive to modulators, such as nucleotides and transition metal oxyanions, that are known to affect Hsp90 function suggests a biological role for oligomerization. In fact, it has been previously shown that Hsp90 oligomers display a chaperone activity at high temperatures (33Yonehara M. Minami Y. Kawata Y. Nagai J. Yahara I. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2641-2645Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar), and Hsp90 oligomers seem to be formed in vivo at heat shock temperature in N. crassa (40Freitag D.G. Ouimet P.M. Girvitz T.L. Kapoor M. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 10221-10229Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Whether they are formed and display a chaperone function in higher eukaryotes during heat shock remains to be determined. Because many cellular factors and other chaperones modulate Hsp90 function (10Pratt W.B. Toft D. Endocr. Rev. 1997; 18: 306-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (1514) Google Scholar, 12Bohen S.P. Yamamoto K.R. Morimoto R.I. Tissieres A. Georgopoulos C. The Biology of Heat Shock Proteins and Molecular Chaperones. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1994: 313-334Google Scholar), it is plausible that some of them may modulate in vivo the critical temperature of Hsp90 oligomerization to a level compatible with cell survival. Indeed, the requirement of very high concentrations of Hsp90 for yeast viability at extreme temperatures (6Borkovich K.A. Farrelly F.W. Finkelstein D.B. Taulien J. Lindquist S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 3919-3930Crossref PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar) may be related to the fact that such high levels favor efficient oligomers formation, which in turn may protect cellular proteins against inactivation. Similarly to Hsp70, Hsp27, and heat shock factor, for which it has been proposed that oligomerization may be involved in their function (44Benaroudj N. Triniolles F. Ladjimi M. Biochemistry. 1996; 34: 15282-15290Crossref Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 45Ehrnsperger M. Gräber S. Gaestel M. Buchner J.

Cell Biol. 1992; 117: 1151-1159Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar), Hsp90 may use oligomerization to trigger functions that are normally silent at physiological temperature and that counteract the deleterious effects of extreme temperatures.

In this report we demonstrate that there are functionally redundant phosphotyrosine-dependent and -independent binding sites for Stat2 in the α and β subunits of the type I IFN-R. Expression of a type I IFN-R containing only the constitutive Stat2 site or the proximal tyrosines of β<sub>L</sub>, but not the docking site on the α chain (Tyr<sup>466</sup> and Tyr<sup>481</sup>), supported low levels of Stat2 activation. However, the presence of only one intact Stat2 site did not lead to induction of interferon-stimulated gene factor 3 (ISGF3) or an antiviral state. Normal levels of Stat2 tyrosine phosphorylation, induction of ISGF3, and an antiviral effect always required the proximal tyrosines of β<sub>L</sub> and at least one of the other Stat2 sites (Tyr<sup>α466, 481</sup> or β<sub>L404–462</sub>). These data suggest that a threshold of Stat2 tyrosine phosphorylation is required for complete activation of ISGF3.

https://openalex.org/W2061238471,"We reported previously that the rate of previtamin D3 (preD3) ⇌ vitamin D3 isomerization was enhanced by about 10 times in the skin compared with that in organic solvents. To elucidate the mechanism by which the rate of this reaction is enhanced in the skin, we developed a liposomal model that mimicked the enhanced isomerization of preD3 to vitamin D3 that was described in human skin. Using this model we studied the effect of changing the polarity of preD3 as well as changing the chain length and the degree of saturation of liposomal phospholipids on the kinetics of preD3 ⇌ vitamin D3 isomerization. We found that a decrease in the hydrophilic interaction of the preD3with liposomal phospholipids by an esterification of the 3β-hydroxy of preD3 (previtamin D3-3β-acetate) reduced the rate of the isomerization by 67%. The addition of a hydroxyl on C-25 of the hydrophobic side chain (25-hydroxyprevitamin D3), which decreased the hydrophobic interaction of preD3 with the phospholipids, reduced the rate by 87%. In contrast, in an isotropic n-hexane solution, there was little difference among the rates of the conversion of preD3, its 3β-acetate, and 25-hydroxy derivatives to their corresponding vitamin D3 compounds. We also determined rate constants (k) of preD3 ⇌ vitamin D3 isomerization in liposomes containing phosphatidylcholines with different carbon chain lengths. The rates of the reaction were found to be enhanced as the number of carbons (Cn) in the hydrocarbon chain of the phospholipids increased from 10 to 18. In conclusion, these results support our hypothesis that amphipathic interactions between preD3 and membrane phospholipids stabilize preD3 in its “cholesterol like” cZc-conformer, the only conformer of preD3 that can convert to vitamin D3. The stronger these interactions were, the more preD3 was likely in its cZc conformation at any moment and the faster was the rate of its conversion to vitamin D3.

This thermally dependent reaction is the final step to produce vitamin D3 in the skin and represents one of the best known examples of a concerted reaction that occurs in vivo. Although it has long been noted that, like other concerted reactions, the interconversion between preD3 ⇌ vitamin D3 is not influenced by a solvent effect when carried out in isotropic solutions (12Schlatmann J.L.M.A. Pot J. Havinga E. Rec. Trav. Chim. Pays-Bas. 1964; 80: 1173-1185Google Scholar), our recent data have revealed that both kinetics and thermodynamics of this reaction may change significantly in many anisotropic microenvironments (13Tian X.Q.

Therefore, this simple yet physiologically important reaction provides us an ideal model to study the mechanism by which the kinetics of a concerted reaction is modified by an anisotropic medium. The seco-B ring of preD3 consists of a conjugated triene system, which confers preD3 with high conformational mobility (Fig. 1). Although the middle double bond in the triene system of preD3 is in the cis (Z) configuration, two conformations arise from rotation around the single bonds C5-C6 and C7-C8 within the triene system i.e. cZc or s-cis,s-cis conformations (Fig. 1 B) and tZc or s-trans,s-cis conformations (Fig.1 D) (9Okamura W.H.

It is known that to chemically isomerize to vitamin D3, preD3 is required to be in the cZc conformation (Fig. 1 B) (9Okamura W.H. Midland M.M. Hammond M.W. Rahman N.A. Dormanen M.C. Nemere I.

From a structure-reactivity point of view, it is important to know whether there is any effect of the conformational restraints imposed by anisotropic media on the chemical transformation of preD3 into vitamin D3. We have previously shown that the rate of the formation of vitamin D3 from preD3 was enhanced by about 10-fold in the skin of terrestrial vertebrates compared with the rate of the same isomerization in an isotropic solution (1Holick M.F. Tian X.Q. Allen M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3124-3126Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 2Tian X.Q. Chen T.C. Lu Z. Shao Q. Holick M.F.

Chem. 1993; 268: 14888-14892Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Based on the finding that the major fraction of cellular 7-DHC and preD3 are present in the cell membrane (13Tian X.Q. Chen T.C. Matsuoka L.Y. Wortsman J. Holick M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14888-14892Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we proposed a mechanism for the membrane-enhanced isomerization of preD3to vitamin D3. We hypothesized that within the anisotropic membrane bilayers, amphipathic interactions between preD3and phospholipids stabilized the “cholesterol-like” cZc conformation of preD3 (Fig.2) and shifted the conformational equilibrium of preD3 toward cZc-preD3, the only conformation of preD3 that isomerizes to vitamin D3. Therefore, the rate of preD3 ⇌ vitamin D3 reaction is enhanced. To test this hypothesis, the effect of changing the polarity of 7-DHC as well as changing the chain length and the degree of saturation of the liposomal phospholipids on the kinetics of preD3 ⇌ vitamin D3 reaction were investigated. We have demonstrated for the first time that there is a positive correlation between the strength of the amphipathic interactions of preD3 with liposomal phospholipids and the rate of preD3 ⇌ vitamin D3 isomerization.Figure 2Proposed theoretical structural model for the localization of the cZc-previtamin D3 in the phospholipids of a membrane. Based on the amphipathic nature and conformational mobility of previtamin D3, we proposed the following model to show the spatial relationship between previtamin D3 and phospholipids. We postulated that in the membrane, the cholesterol like cZc-previtamin D3 is aligned parallel to its neighboring phospholipids, with its polar 3β-hydroxy interacting with the polar head groups of the phospholipids through hydrogen bonding, and the hydrophobic rings and side chain interacting with the nonpolar acyl chains of the lipids through hydrophobic and van der Waals interactions.

(Wilton, NH). 25-Hydroxy-7-dehydrocholesterol (25(OH)7-DHC) was a kind gift from Dr. Rick Gray (Amoco Bioproducts, Naperville, IL). All the above chemicals were purified by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and stored at −80 °C before use. Saturated lipids including didecanoylphosphatidylcholine (DDPC, C10:0) (99%), dilauroylphosphatidylcholine (DLPC, C12:0) (99%), dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (DPPC, C16:0) (99%), distearoylphosphatidylcholine (DSPC, C18:0) (99%), diarachidoylphosphatidylcholine (DAPC, C20:0) (99%), and unsaturated lipids dipalmitoleoylphosphatidylcholine (C16:1, [cis]-9) (99%) were obtained from Sigma.HPLC was performed with a P1000 pump equipped with a UV2000 UV-visible absorption detector (Thermo Separation Products, San Jose, CA). An Econosphere silica column (250 × 4.6 mm, 5 μm; Alltech Associate, Inc., Deerfield, IL) was used to separate the various vitamin D metabolites except their 3β-acetate derivatives, which were separated by a Cyclobond I 2000 column (100 × 4.6 mm, 5 μm; Advanced Separation Technologies Inc., Whippany, NJ).UV spectra of vitamin D3, preD3 and their photoisomers as well as their 25-hydroxylated derivatives were recorded either by a UV spectrometer (U-2000, Hitachi Instruments, Inc., Stoughton, MA) or by an online HPLC UV detector (UV2000).MethodsPreparation of Liposomes and Human Skin SamplesLiposomes were prepared by a modified procedure reported by Wiseman et al. (15Wiseman H. Cannon M. Arnstein H.R.V. Halliwell B. FEBS Lett. 1990; 274: 107-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 16Wiseman H.

The different lipids were dissolved in pure chloroform to give a final concentration of 20 mg/ml. An aliquot of the stock solution was taken and mixed with an equal volume of one of the following standard solutions of 7-DHC, 25(OH)7-DHC, and 7-DHC-3β-acetate. The organic solvent was evaporated by a stream of nitrogen. When necessary, the vials containing lipids were left under high vacuum overnight to remove trace solvent. The thin lipid film was resuspended in a 10 mm phosphate buffer (pH = 7.4) followed by vortexing and sonication. The resulting liposomes (lipid concentration, 6.75 mm; molar ratio of lipid to incorporated sterol, 100:2) were sealed in ampules that had previously been flushed with argon. The preparation of liposomes (hydration and vortexing) was performed above the transition temperature (T m) of the corresponding lipid mixture (DMPC, 23 °C; DPPC, 41.5 °C; and DSPC, 58 °C) (17Woodle M.C.

Briefly, neonatal foreskin was cleaned from subcutaneous tissues and cut into small pieces (about 0.3 cm2). Before UV irradiation, skin samples were immersed in a water bath at 60 °C for 30 s (this technique allows the separation of the dermis from epidermis at the stratum basale).Photoreaction and Thermal IsomerizationHeat-treated skin samples, ampules containing liposome preparations, ampules containing a solution of 7-DHC or its analogues in n-hexane (0.135 mm), and ampules containing a solution of 7-DHC-DPPC inn-hexane (7-DHC, 0.135 mm; DPPC, 6.75 mm) were placed on ice and irradiated by UV Medical Sunlamps (National Biological Corp., Cleveland, OH) for 3 min (13Tian X.Q.

Spectral output for these lamps peaked at about 314 nm, and about 56% of the total output was within UV-B range (13Tian X.Q. Chen T.C. Matsuoka L.Y. Wortsman J. Holick M.F. J. Biol.

The formation of vitamin D3 from preD3 was analyzed by the HPLC method described below.HPLC AnalysisImmediately after incubation, the heat-treated skin was separated into epidermis and dermis according to a previously described method (5Holick M.F.

Epidermis and liposomes were extracted three times with 8% ethyl acetate in n-hexane (5Holick M.F. MacLaughlin J.A. Clark M.B. Holick S.A. Potts Jr., J.T. Anderson R.R. Blank I.H. Parrish J.A.

The residue was reconstituted with mobile phase and centrifuged briefly to remove insoluble particles before HPLC analysis.Methods of HPLC separation and quantification of unmodified preD3 and vitamin D3 have been described previously (2Tian X.Q.

To the best of our knowledge, there have been no reports on HPLC separation of 25(OH)preD3 as well as preD3 acetate from their photo- and thermal isomers in the literature. We therefore developed the following HPLC systems for the separations. Complete separation of 25(OH)preD3 from its photo- and thermal isomers was obtained with isocratic elution of 2% 2-propanol in n-hexane on an Alltech Econosphere silica column (250 × 4.6 mm, 5 μm). Separation of the various preD3 acetate isomers was achieved by using an Astec Cyclobond I 2000 column (100 × 4.6 mm, 5 μm) with 0.03% 2-propanol in n-hexane as a mobile phase.Kinetic Studies of the Thermal IsomerizationThe thermal conversion between preD3 and vitamin D3 is a first order reversible process. The integrated rate equation is expressed as k=1/tln[(De−Do)/(De−Dt)]Equation 1 where De, Do, and Dt are concentrations of vitamin D3 at time t equals equilibrium, zero and t, respectively. The total rate constant (k) is calculated from the slope of the plot of ln[(De − Do)/(De − Dt)] versus timet. The equilibrium constant (K) of the reaction is expressed as: K=[vitamin D]eq/[preD]eqEquation 2 where [vitaminD]eq and [preD]eq are equilibrium concentrations of vitamin D3 and preD3, respectively.DISCUSSIONThe first objective of this study was to develop a simple model by which the mechanism of the synthesis of vitamin D3in the skin could be studied. Based on our previous finding that 7-DHC and its photolyzed product preD3 were present in the skin cell membrane, we incorporated 7-DHC into liposomes to mimic the membrane phospholipid bilayers. We found that the rate for the preD3 ⇌ vitamin D3 isomerization in DPPC liposomes and human skin was essentially the same. The rate of the reaction was about 10-fold faster in liposomes (8.72 ± 1.11 × 10−5 s−1) compared with that inn-hexane (8.08 ± 0.07 × 10−6s−1) and similar to human skin (8.62 ± 0.24 × 10−5 s−1). The equilibrium constant was also significantly higher in liposomes than the values obtained from the isotropic n-hexane solution and similar to human skin. Thus our liposome model closely mimicked the kinetic properties of the preD3 ⇌ vitamin D3 isomerization in the skin (1Holick M.F. Tian X.Q. Allen M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3124-3126Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 2Tian X.Q. Chen T.C. Lu Z. Shao Q. Holick M.F.

Chem. 1993; 268: 14888-14892Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This is in contrast to the cholesteric liquid-crystalline model used by Cassis and Weiss (18Cassis E.G. Weiss R.G. Photochem. Photobiol. 1982; 35: 439-444Crossref Scopus (20) Google Scholar) in which the determined equilibrium constant was smaller instead of larger than that determined in organic solvents.Next, we examined the effects of isotropic versusanisotropic interactions of DPPC with preD3 on the rate of preD3 ⇌ vitamin D3 isomerization. We found that in an isotropic solution of DPPC/n-hexane, the rate of preD3 ⇌ vitamin D3 isomerization is essentially the same as in a solution of pure n-hexane (8.06 ± 0.13 × 10−6 s−1 versus 8.08 ± 0.07 × 10−6s−1) (Fig. 4). In contrast, the rate of preD3⇌ vitamin D3 isomerization in a solution of DPPC liposomes is enhanced by about 10 times compared with that inn-hexane (Fig. 4). Our results indicate that isotropic interactions of phospholipids with preD3 do not affect the rate of preD3 ⇌ vitamin D3 conversion, but in an anisotropic microenvironment such as liposomes and skin, the rate of the isomerization is greatly enhanced (Fig. 4).We used the liposomes as a simple model for the membrane bilayers to study the mechanism by which the rate of preD3 ⇌ vitamin D3 conversion was greatly enhanced in the skin. It is known that phospholipids and preD3 are amphipathic molecules (ones with both hydrophilic and hydrophobic parts). Based on structural similarity, it was proposed (1Holick M.F. Tian X.Q. Allen M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3124-3126Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 19Moriarty R. Schwartz R.N. Lee C. Curtis V. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1980; 102: 4257-4259Crossref Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 20Tian X.Q. Holick M.F. Allen M. Holick M.F. Jung E.G. Biologic Effects of Light 1995. Walter de Gruyter & Co., Berlin1995: 39-48Google Scholar) that, within the ordered lipid bilayer, preD3 molecules oriented themselves in a way similar to cholesterol molecules, i.e. with their hydrophilic C3β hydroxyl group close to the polar head groups of lipids, whereas their hydrophobic rings and the side chain aligned along the hydrocarbon chains of membrane lipids (Fig. 2). However, unlike the rigid cholesterol, the seco-B ring sterol, preD3, is very conformationally mobile. Rotation about the single C5-C6 bond of preD3 generates a wide array of conformations extending from cZc-preD3 to tZc-preD3 (Fig. 1). It was well established that the thermal isomerization between preD3 ⇌ vitamin D3 was a conformation-controlled process and required a cyclic transition state, possible only for cZc conformers but not possible for tZc and other conformers (Fig. 1) (10Dauben W.G. Funhoff D.J.H. J. Org. Chem. 1987; 53: 5070-5075Crossref Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 11Dauben W.G. Funhoff D.J.H. J. Org. Chem. 1988; 53: 5376-5379Crossref Scopus (14) Google Scholar).We hypothesized that the conformational restraints imposed by amphipathic interactions between preD3 and phospholipids stabilized the “cholesterol like” cZc-preD3 conformer (Fig. 2). Therefore, the conformational equilibrium of cZc-preD3 ⇌ tZc-preD3 was shifted to the cZc conformation. According to the hypothesis, the population of preD3 molecules existing in the cZc form at any instant was higher in a lipid bilayer compared with an isotropic solution, and consequently, the rate of the thermal isomerization of preD3 was enhanced (1Holick M.F. Tian X.Q. Allen M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3124-3126Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). If this hypothesis was correct, it was expected that there would be a positive correlation between the strength of the amphipathic interactions and the rate of this thermal isomerization. To evaluate the hypothesis, we examined the effect of decreasing the polarity of the preD3 by acetylation of C3β-OH on the kinetics of the thermal conversion of preD3 in liposomes. It was found that by reducing the strength of the amphipathic interactions between the amphiphiles, the rate of the isomerization of preD3 was markedly reduced. The rate of the isomerization of preD3-3β-acetate was reduced to less than one-third the rate of its unesterfied counterpart, preD3 (Fig. 6). The reduced rate of the isomerization probably reflected that the less polar C3β ester group was less effective than free C3β-OH of preD3in hydrophilic interaction with polar head groups of liposomal phospholipids.We speculated that the free 3β-OH of preD3 would interact with adjacent polar phospholipid head group via hydrogen bonding as cholesterol likely does (21Villalain J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 241: 586-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 22Theunissen J.J.H. Jackson R.L. Kempen H.J.M. Demel R.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1986; 860: 66-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Hydrogen bonding can lead to tight packing of phospholipid bilayers and, thus, enhance the strength of the amphipathic interaction of liposomal lipids with preD3. Because of the absence of a free 3β-OH, preD3-3β-acetate was unable to form a hydrogen bond with the carbonyl groups of phospholipids. This weakened the hydrophilic interactions between preD3-3β-acetate, and membrane lipids probably reduced the efficiency of stabilizing the preD3-3β-acetate in its cZc conformer and led to a slower rate of its isomerization to vitamin D3-3β-acetate. This observation emphasizes the important role of C3 hydroxyl group for the correct orientation of the preD3 molecule within phospholipid bilayers and its optimal hydrophilic interactions with polar head groups of membrane phospholipids.We also investigated whether a disruption in the hydrophobic (van der Waals) interactions between preD3 and hydrophobic tails of phospholipids had an effect on the rate of preD3 ⇌ vitamin D3 conversion by the addition of a hydroxyl group on the hydrophobic side chain of preD3 at C25. It is known that the liposomal phospholipid bilayers are held together mainly by hydrophobic interactions. The presence of hydrophilic C25 hydroxyl group in the hydrophobic core disorganized phospholipid bilayers (22Theunissen J.J.H. Jackson R.L. Kempen H.J.M. Demel R.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1986; 860: 66-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 23Verma S. Philippot J.R. Wallach D.F.H. Biochemistry. 1983; 22: 4587-4591Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), and thus, the strength of van der Waals interactions between the hydrophobic tails of phospholipids and 25(OH)preD3 could be significantly weakened. It is also possible that 25(OH)preD3 can be folded so that both 3β- and 25-hydroxyl groups align close to polar head groups of liposomal phospholipids (23Verma S. Philippot J.R. Wallach D.F.H. Biochemistry. 1983; 22: 4587-4591Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) and further disorganize phospholipid bilayers. Accordingly, the stabilizing effect of phospholipid bilayers on the cZc-25(OH)preD3 would be much less effective. Therefore, the rate of the 25(OH)preD3 ⇌ 25(OH)D3isomerization was anticipated to be reduced more markedly than the rate of preD3-3β-acetate ⇌ vitamin D3-3β-acetate isomerization. Our results demonstrated that the rate of the isomerization of 25(OH)preD3 in liposomes was reduced by about 7-fold compared with the rate of the isomerization of preD3 in liposomes, which approached the rate determined in an isotropic solution (Fig. 6).The strength of the amphipathic interactions between the incorporated preD3 and liposomal phospholipids depends not only on the polarity of preD3 but also on the hydrophobicity of phospholipids. To evaluate the effect of changing structures of phospholipids by altering either the carbon chain length or chain saturation on the rate of preD3 ⇌ vitamin D3, isomerization was examined.We first carried out kinetic studies of preD3 ⇌ vitamin D3 isomerization in liposomes prepared by phospholipids with different hydrocarbon chain lengths. We observed a chain length-dependent rate enhancement of the isomerization. Fig. 7 showed that the rate of the thermal isomerization in the different liposomes followed the order DSPC (C18:0) > DPPC (C16:0) > DLPC (C12:0) > DDPC (C10:0). Least squares analysis of the data revealed a positive linear relationship (r = 0.999) between ln k (k, rate constant) and ln Cn(Cn, number of carbon atoms in the hydrocarbon chains of phospholipids) (Fig. 7). Because the strength of the amphipathic interactions is directly related to the chain length of phospholipids, our observation further supports the hypothesis that there is a positive correlation between the strength of the anisotropic interactions between the amphiphiles and the rate of the isomerization.We found that DSPC (C18:0) liposomes had the maximum effect on the rate enhancement of preD3 ⇌ vitamin D3isomerization (Fig. 7). It indicated that the optimal amphipathic interactions between preD3 and phospholipids were achieved in DSPC (18:0) liposomes. Based on this information, we estimated that the “effective hydrophobic length of preD3” corresponded to the length of a 18-carbon chain, which was similar to the reported value o"

The heme is shown to have bis-imidazole coordination, and neither of the histidines has imidazolate character. Barley Hb has a unique heme environment as judged from the Fe-CO and C-O stretching frequencies in the CO complex. Two Fe-CO stretching modes are observed with frequencies at 534 and 493 cm−1, with relative intensities that are pH sensitive. The 534 cm−1 conformer shows a deuterium shift, indicating that the iron-bound CO is hydrogen-bonded, presumably to the distal histidine. A C-O stretching mode at 1924 cm−1 is assigned as being associated with the 534 cm−1 conformer. Evidence is presented that the high Fe-CO and low C-O stretching frequencies (534 and 1924 cm−1, respectively) arise from a short hydrogen bond between the distal histidine and the CO. The 493 cm−1conformer arises from an open conformation of the heme pocket and becomes the dominant population under acidic conditions when the distal histidine moves away from the CO. Strong hydrogen bonding between the bound ligand and the distal histidine in the CO complex of barley Hb implies that a similar structure may occur in the oxy derivative, imparting a high stability to the bound oxygen.

In any hemeprotein, the heme pocket structure plays a crucial role in controlling protein function, such as heme ligand stability, and thus determines the class of a particular hemeprotein. Since barley Hb is a newly discovered hemeprotein, it is important to elucidate the structure of the heme pocket as a whole, particularly the nature of the heme axial ligands and the electronic environment of the heme crevice. Upon unveiling of the specific nonbonding interactions that prevail in the heme pocket, the origin of the remarkably slow oxygen dissociation rate may be elucidated.The 6-coordinate nature of ferrous barley Hb is reminiscent of the structure of cytochromes. For this reason, it is of interest to identify the ligands to the heme iron. Here we present evidence that the histidine, placed by sequence alignment in the position proximal to the heme iron, ligates to the iron and has the character of an uncharged imidazole. We further show that a second histidine residue, placed by sequence alignment in the position distal to the heme iron, ligates to the heme. Furthermore, we show that the distal histidine interacts with exogenous iron-bound CO in a novel manner and may account for a remarkably high ligand stability associated with the slow oxygen dissociation rate of barley oxyHb.

Because the level of Hb in barley aleurone tissue is of the order of only 20 μm, an expression system in Escherichia coli was developed to produce a barley Hb fusion protein that is indistinguishable from the native protein in most properties but differs in having five extra amino acids at the N terminus (1Duff S.M.G.

https://openalex.org/W2013375427,"14-3-3 proteins bind to the hinge 1 region of nitrate reductase (NR) and inhibit its activity. To determine which residues of NR are required for 14-3-3-inhibitory interactions, wild-type and mutant forms of Arabidopsis NR were examined in the yeast two-hybrid system and in vitro inhibition assays. NR fragments with or without hinge 1 were introduced into yeast with one of seven Arabidopsis 14-3-3 isoforms (called GF14s). NR fragments (residues 1-562 or 487-562) containing hinge 1 interacted with all GF-14s tested; an NR fragment (residues 1-487) lacking hinge 1 did not. GF14 binding to NR fragments was dependent on Ser-534, since Asp or Ala substitutions at this site blocked the interaction. Revertants with second site substitutions restoring interaction between GF14omega and the Ala- or Asp-substituted NR fragments were identified. One isolate had a Lys to Glu substitution at position 531, which is in hinge 1, and six isolates had Ile to Leu or Phe substitutions at 561 in the heme binding region. Double mutant forms of holo-NR (S534D plus K531E, I561F, or I561L) were constructed and found to be partially inhibited by protein extracts from Arabidopsis containing 14-3-3 proteins. Wild-type NR is phosphorylated and inhibited by these extracts, but S534D single mutant forms are not. These results show that inhibitory NR/14-3-3 interactions are dependent on Ser-534 but only in the context of the wild-type sequence, since substitutions at second sites render 14-3-3 binding and in vitro NR inhibition independent of Ser-534."
https://openalex.org/W2072010065,"In an attempt to further understand how nuclear events (such as gene expression, nuclear import/export, and cell cycle checkpoint control) might be subject to regulation by extracellular stimuli, we sought to identify nuclear activities under growth factor control. Using a sensitive photoaffinity labeling assay that measured [α-32P]GTP incorporation into nuclear proteins, we identified the 20-kDa subunit of the nuclear cap-binding complex (CBC) as a protein whose binding activity is greatly enhanced by the extracellular stimulation of serum-arrested cells. The CBC represents a 20- and 80-kDa heterodimer (the subunits independently referred to as CBP20 and CBP80, respectively) that binds the 7-methylguanosine cap on RNAs transcribed by RNA polymerase II. This binding facilitates precursor messenger RNA splicing and export. We have demonstrated that the [α-32P]GTP incorporation into CBP20 was correlated with an increased ability of the CBC to bind capped RNA and have used the [α-32P]GTP photoaffinity assay to characterize the activation of the CBC in response to growth factors. We show that the CBC is activated by heregulin in HeLa cells and by nerve growth factor in PC12 cells as well as during the G1/S phase of the cell cycle and when cells are stressed with UV irradiation. Additionally, we show that cap-dependent splicing of precursor mRNA, a functional outcome of CBC activation, can be catalyzed by growth factor addition to serum-arrested cells. Taken together, these data identify the CBC as a nuclear target for growth factor-coupled signal transduction and suggest novel mechanisms by which growth factors can influence gene expression and cell growth.

Growth factor binding to cell-surface receptors can initiate signals that are propagated through the cell by a cascade of protein-protein interactions, ultimately to impact upon specific cellular functions and regulate cell growth. The activities of signaling molecules must be tightly regulated to maintain the integrity of cellular communication, as loss of regulation in these processes can give rise to defects in cell growth and metabolism that may lead to human disease. Given the importance of signaling processes in cell growth, a great deal of effort has gone into the elucidation of proteins participating in signaling pathways that start at the level of receptor activation and culminate in the stimulation of a nuclear activity. Multiple cascades have now been identified that result in the activation of different nuclear mitogen-activated protein kinases, including the extracellular receptor-activated kinases and the stress-responsive c-Jun N-terminal kinase/stress-activated protein kinase and p38 (1Marshall C.J.

Extracellular receptor-activated kinase activation is the outcome of mitogen-stimulated Ras signaling, whereas c-Jun N-terminal kinase/stress-activated protein kinase and p38 activities are often stimulated by pathways involving the Cdc42 and Rac GTP-binding proteins (2Hunter T.

Although these different signaling pathways were originally thought to be independently regulated, later work showed that cross-talk between the individual mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways exists. A common functional outcome of the activation of these signaling pathways is a translocation of the activated mitogen-activated protein kinase to the nucleus and subsequent activation of specific transcription factors and gene expression (2Hunter T.

How other nuclear functions might be influenced in response to extracellular stimulation is less clear. However, it is attractive to envision how critical nuclear activities such as RNA metabolism and export, nuclear protein import, and cell cycle control might be subject to regulation as downstream targets of extracellular stimuli. With this in mind, we set out to identify novel nuclear activities that were growth factor-responsive. Using a photoaffinity labeling approach, we identified the nuclear cap-binding complex (CBC) 1The abbreviations used are: CBC, cap-binding complex; NGF, nerve growth factor; EGF, epidermal growth factor; TBS, Tris-buffered saline; DTT, dithiothreitol; AMP-PNP, adenosine 5′-(β,γ-iminotriphosphate); GMP-PNP, guanosine 5′-(β,γ-iminotriphosphate); PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; GST, glutathione S-transferase; HA, hemagglutinin; eIF, eukaryotic initiation factor; snRNA, small nucleotide RNA. as such an activity based on the enhanced ability of its ∼20-kDa subunit (CBP20) to undergo a photocatalyzed incorporation of [α-32P]GTP in response to extracellular stimulation.

We demonstrate that the incorporation of [α-32P]GTP by CBP20 reflects the activation of the CBC and is correlated with its ability to bind capped RNA. A variety of growth factors and other cellular stimuli can activate the CBC under conditions that can give rise to a stimulation of the splicing of precursor mRNAs in an in vitro assay system. The implications of CBP20 functioning as a novel end point in signal transduction highlight the importance of RNA metabolism in regulated cell growth. Rat pheochromocytoma (PC12) cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 5% fetal bovine serum, 10% horse serum, and antibiotic/antimycotic solution (Sigma). All other cell types, including HeLa, BHK21, and COS-7 cells, were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with the addition of 10% fetal bovine serum and antibiotic/antimycotic solution. Prior to growth factor treatment, cells were switched to serum-free medium for 40 h. Growth factors (NGF (Life Technologies, Inc.), heregulin β1 (residues 177–244; a generous gift from Dr. Mark Sliwkowski, Genentech), and EGF (Calbiochem) or 25% fetal bovine serum) were then added to the serum-free medium in the concentrations and for the times indicated under “Results” at 37 °C. Following treatment, the growth factor-containing medium was removed, and the cells were washed twice with Tris-buffered saline (TBS; 25 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, 140 mm NaCl, and 1.0 mm EDTA) and then lysed (see below). Cell cycle blocks were performed in HeLa cells. A G0 block was achieved by switching to serum-free medium for 22–24 h. For G1/S phase arrest, 2.5 mm thymidine was added to the growth medium for 22–24 h. 80 ng/ml nocodazole was added to the growth medium for 22–24 h to achieve arrest in M phase. After treatment, cells were collected, washed twice with TBS, and lysed. To challenge cells with UV irradiation, the medium was removed from serum-starved cells, and the cells were then exposed to UV light for 2 min. Following exposure, cells were replenished with serum-free medium and allowed to recover at 37 °C for the times indicated below. Tissue culture cells were washed twice on the plate with TBS and then lysed in a buffer containing Hanks' solution (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 5 mm KCl, 137 mm NaCl, 4 mmNaHCO3, 5.5 mmd-glucose, and 10 μm EDTA), 0.3% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 1 mmsodium orthovanadate, 1 mm DTT, 1 mmphenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, and 10 μg/ml each leupeptin and aprotinin. The lysate was then centrifuged at 800 rpm for 15 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was microcentrifuged for 10 min at 4 °C, and then the resulting supernatant was saved as the cytoplasmic fraction. The nuclear pellet was washed twice with an equal volume of Hanks' solution with 0.2% (v/v) Triton X-100 and centrifuged at 800 rpm for 15 min at 4 °C. The resulting pellet was treated as the purified nuclear fraction. The nuclei were then lysed in a buffer containing 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 400 mm KCl, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm DTT, and protease inhibitors as described above. The samples were incubated on ice for 30 min and microcentrifuged for 10 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant was used as the whole nuclear fraction. For nuclear fractionation, nuclei were isolated from tissue culture cells, and nuclear membranes and nuclear soluble fractions were then prepared as described by Davis and Blobel (17Davis L.I. Blobel G. Cell. 1986; 45: 699-709Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar) with some modification. The whole nuclear fraction was resuspended in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 10% (w/v) sucrose, 1 mmsodium orthovanadate, 1 mm DTT, 1 mmMgCl2, and protease inhibitors. DNase-I (5 mg/ml) and RNase A (1 mg/ml) were added, and the nuclei were then incubated for 15 min at 37 °C. Following the incubation with DNase-I, the nuclei were underlaid with 30% sucrose and then subjected to centrifugation in a swinging bucket rotor for 10 min at 20,000 × g to generate a soluble nuclear fraction and a nuclear membrane fraction. Photoaffinity labeling of cellular proteins with [α-32P]GTP was performed as described previously (18Singh U.S. Erickson J.W. Cerione R.A. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 15863-15871Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). In brief, the UV cross-linking reaction was carried out in a buffer containing 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 2 mm EGTA, 1 mm DTT, 20% (v/v) glycerol, 100 mm NaCl, and 500 μm AMP-PNP. Samples (20 μl) prepared from the cell fractionation procedures, described above, were incubated for 10 min at room temperature with an equal volume of cross-linking buffer containing [α-32P]GTP (2–3 μCi/sample, 3000 Ci/mmol; NEN Life Science Products ) in a 96-well, non-tissue culture-treated plate. The samples were then placed in an ice bath and irradiated with UV light (254 nm) for 15 min. After irradiation, samples were mixed with 5× Laemmli buffer and boiled. SDS-PAGE was performed using 15% acrylamide gels. The gels were then typically silver-stained and dried, and autoradiography was performed (typically overnight) using Kodak X-Omat XAR-5 film at −80 °C. To perform competition experiments, competing nucleotides (m7GpppG and GpppG (New England Biolabs Inc.) and m7GTP and GTP (Sigma)) were added to the sample prior to the addition of the [α-32P]GTP-containing cross-linking buffer. This buffer did not contain AMP-PNP. The samples were then subjected to UV cross-linking as described above. Bovine retinas were obtained frozen from J. A. & W. L. Lawson Co. (Lincoln, NE). The retinas (typically 200/batch) were thawed in a buffer containing 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 25 mm KCl, 5 mmMgCl2, and protease inhibitors as described for cell lysate preparations and then homogenized with a motor-driven Dounce homogenizer. The homogenate was centrifuged at 2500 rpm in a swinging bucket rotor to yield a crude nuclear pellet. The nuclei were purified from this crude preparation using the method described by Blobel and Potter (19Blobel G. Potter V.R. Science. 1966; 154: 1662-1665Crossref PubMed Scopus (986) Google Scholar), and the soluble nuclear contents were then extracted as described above. The 18-kDa activity was precipitated using 40–75% ammonium sulfate, resuspended in 3–5 ml of Buffer A (50 mmTris, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, 20 mm KCl), and loaded onto a fast protein liquid chromatography Superdex-200 Highload 16/60 column as described above. The purification of this activity was monitored by both silver staining and UV cross-linking to [α-32P]GTP. The fractions eluted from the Superdex-200 column were assayed for [α-32P]GTP incorporation into the 18-kDa protein, and six peak fractions (eluting with molecular masses of ∼100–150 kDa) were pooled in a final volume of 12 ml and loaded directly onto a fast protein liquid chromatography ion-exchange Mono Q 5/5 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated in Buffer A minus KCl. Bound proteins were eluted from the Mono Q 5/5 column with a 28-ml linear gradient of 100–500 mm NaCl. [α-32P]GTP-incorporating activity eluted from the Mono Q 5/5 column with ∼300 mm NaCl in a volume of 5 ml. Peak activity as assayed by [α-32P]GTP incorporation was eluted from the Mono Q column and applied directly to a Bio-Gel HPHT hydroxylapatite column (Bio-Rad) equilibrated in 10 mmpotassium phosphate, pH 6.8, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 0.01 mm CaCl2, and 1 mm DTT. Bound proteins were then eluted, first by stepping the potassium phosphate to 100 mm and then by a 20-ml linear gradient of 100–300 mm potassium phosphate. Peak activity as assayed by the light-catalyzed incorporation of [α-32P]GTP was found to elute with ∼250 mm phosphate. CBP20 was cloned by polymerase chain reaction from HeLa cell cDNA (a generous gift from Dr. Wannian Yang, Cornell University). 5′- and 3′-primers were designed using the published sequence for Homo sapiensCBP20 (GenBankTM accession P52298), and theCBP20 gene was then amplified from the HeLa cell cDNA using 40 polymerase chain reaction cycles (1 min at 94 °C, 1 min at 55 °C, and 1 min at 72 °C). The 470-base product was inserted into a cloning vector (pCR2.1) using a TA cloning kit (Invitrogen) and then subcloned into the mammalian expression vector pcDNA3 (Invitrogen) and into the Escherichia coli expression vector pGEX-2TK. E. coli cells transformed with the pGEX-2TK-CBP20 vector were grown in a 1-liter culture, and expression of glutathioneS-transferase (GST)-CBP20 protein was induced for 3 h using isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside. Following induction, the cells were pelleted by centrifugation (5000 rpm for 10 min in a JA-10 rotor). The harvested cells were resuspended in 15 ml of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 50 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, and protease inhibitors (as described above) and then lysed using 15 mg of lysozyme, followed by the addition of 200 mm MgCl2 and 1 mg of DNase-I. Following centrifugation (100,00 × g for 30 min at 4 °C), the supernatant was incubated with glutathione-agarose beads for 1 h at 4 °C to bind the GST-CBP20 protein. Glutathione-agarose-bound CBP20 was washed with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.5% (v/v) Triton X-100, 200 mm KCl, and 1 mm DTT and then stored in a buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, 10 μm GTP, and protease inhibitors. GST-CBP20 was eluted from the glutathione-agarose beads using 10 mm glutathione, pH 8.0, and the GST moiety was cleaved from CBP20 by the addition of 500 units of thrombin for 30 min at room temperature. Using the LipofectAMINE protocol (Life Technologies, Inc.), a hemagglutinin-tagged form of CBP20 (HA-CBP20) was transiently transfected into BHK21 cells according to the manufacturer's directions. Following a 5-h incubation with serum-free medium containing the lipid-DNA complex, the medium was removed and replaced with medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum. Cells were allowed to grow in the presence of serum for ∼20 h and were then switched to serum-free medium for 40 h prior to stimulation with serum. A polyclonal antibody generated against recombinant CBP80 (αCBP80) was prepared as described previously (7Izaurralde E. Lewis J. McGuigan C. Jankowska M. Darzynkiewicz E. Mattaj I.W. Cell. 1994; 78: 657-668Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar). Cytosolic and nuclear lysates were prepared as described above. Prior to immunoprecipitation, the cytosolic lysate was adjusted to 100 mm NaCl, and the nuclear lysate was diluted 3-fold with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm DTT, and 1 mm sodium orthovanadate. The lysates were then allowed to incubate at 4 °C for 1 h, with or without the addition of 5 μl of 12CA5 monoclonal antibody or αCBP80 polyclonal antibody. Following the first incubation, 40 μl of protein A-Sepharose beads were added to each sample, and the samples were incubated for another hour at 4 °C. The samples were then centrifuged, and the immunoprecipitated pellets were washed four times with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 133 mm KCl, 0.33% Triton X-100, 1 mm DTT, and 1 mm sodium orthovanadate. The resulting immunoprecipitated pellets were resuspended in 20 μl of UV cross-linking buffer and were incubated with [α-32P]GTP and UV cross-linked as described above. For Western blot analysis, proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes following SDS-PAGE. The polyvinylidene difluoride membranes were blocked with 2.5% (w/v) bovine serum albumin in TBS plus 0.1% Tween 20 for 1 h at room temperature. After blocking, the membranes were incubated with either 12CA5 or αCBP80 antibody for 1 h at room temperature, washed with several changes of TBS and 0.1% Tween 20, and incubated for 30 min at room temperature with sheep anti-rabbit or sheep anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibody (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) as appropriate. Immunolabeling was detected by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) according to the manufacturer's instructions. UV cross-linking was done essentially as described by Rozen and Sonenberg (20Rozen F. Sonenberg N. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 6489-6500Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), except that the RNA probe was transcribed from BamHI-cleaved pBluescript II KS with T3 RNA polymerase (Promega). Splicing extracts were prepared from HeLa cells (serum-starved for 40 h prior to stimulation with 100 nm heregulin for 24 h) as described by Lee and Green (21Lee K.A. Green M.R. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 181: 20-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). pBSAd1 precursor linearized bySau3AI was transcribed using T3 RNA polymerase in the presence of m7GpppG dinucleotide cap. Splicing reactions were then carried out as described by Izaurralde et al. (7Izaurralde E. Lewis J. McGuigan C. Jankowska M. Darzynkiewicz E. Mattaj I.W. Cell. 1994; 78: 657-668Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar). In brief, 60 μg of splicing extract were preincubated for 15 min at 30 °C with 1 mm MgCl2. 5 mmcreatine phosphate, 1.5 mm ATP, 2.5 × 104cpm of labeled precursor mRNA, and an additional 1 mmMgCl2 were then added in a final volume of 20 μl, and the reactions were incubated for 2 h at 30 °C. Splice products were visualized by separation on a 10% denaturing polyacrylamide gel, followed by autoradiography. The overall goal of these studies was to identify nuclear activities that could represent novel downstream targets in receptor-coupled signaling pathways. One of the assays we used to identify such activities was the photocatalyzed incorporation of [α-32P]GTP into nuclear proteins. The rationale for this approach was that it would provide a very sensitive assay for identifying guanine nucleotide-binding activities in the nucleus, in a manner analogous to the use of phosphorylation assays to identify growth factor-sensitive phosphosubstrates. Using this assay, we identified an 18-kDa protein that strongly incorporated [α-32P]GTP in serum-treated but not serum-starved cells (see below). We found this activity to be exclusively nuclear and present in every cell line we examined, including HeLa, PC12, COS-7, and BHK21 cells, as well as in various mammary epithelial cells. A similar activity was also observed in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. A purification scheme was developed using bovine retinal nuclei, which were a particularly rich source of this 18-kDa nuclear activity. A series of three chromatography steps resolved the activity, as assayed by [α-32P]GTP incorporation, from the majority of contaminating low molecular mass proteins (see “Experimental Procedures”). These steps also resolved an 80-kDa protein (designated p80), detected by silver staining, which co-purified with the 18-kDa activity. This putative protein complex was reminiscent of the nuclear CBC, as the CBC comprises an 18-kDa nuclear protein, CBP20 (forcap-binding protein20), stably complexed with an 80-kDa protein, designated CBP80. The formation of the CBP20-CBP80 heterodimer enables the CBC to bind a guanine derivative, the 7-methylguanosine cap structure (m7GpppN), on RNAs transcribed by RNA polymerase II (7Izaurralde E.

The similarities between the 18-kDa nuclear activity and CBP20 (both in complex formation and substrate binding) led us to investigate whether the CBC was a nuclear target for extracellular signals. First, we assayed directly the ability of recombinant E. coli-expressed CBP20 to incorporate [α-32P]GTP. Fig. 1 A shows GST-CBP20, thrombin-cleaved CBP20, and the complexed CBC proteins (His-tagged CBP20 (9Izaurralde E. Lewis J. Gamberi C. Jarmolowski A. McGuigan C. Mattaj I.W. Nature. 1995; 376: 709-712Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar) and CBP80 (7Izaurralde E. Lewis J. McGuigan C. Jankowska M. Darzynkiewicz E. Mattaj I.W. Cell. 1994; 78: 657-668Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar)) as visualized by staining with Coomassie Blue. Fig. 1 B shows that the recombinant CBP20 proteins were all capable of incorporating [α-32P]GTP in a photoaffinity labeling assay. This activity was greatly enhanced by the presence of CBP80 (see lane 5), consistent with previous studies that have demonstrated that complex formation between CBP20 and CBP80 is necessary for capped RNA binding. The GST control did not show any cross-linking to [α-32P]GTP. We next examined whether the ability of CBP20 to incorporate [α-32P]GTP could be regulated in response to serum. BHK21 cells were transiently transfected with a HA-tagged CBP20 construct. Following 40 h of serum starvation, the cells were stimulated with 25% fetal bovine serum for 1.5 h, and HA-CBP20 was immunoprecipitated from cytosolic and nuclear lysates prepared from either serum-starved or stimulated cells. The immunoprecipitates were then assayed for the photocatalyzed incorporation of [α-32P]GTP into CBP20. HA-CBP20 was present in both the cytosolic and nuclear fractions (Fig.2 B), and CBP80 co-immunoprecipitated with nuclear localized HA-CBP20 equally well under conditions of either serum starvation or stimulation (Fig.2 A). The large percentage of HA-CBP20 localized to the cytosol is presumably the result of its overexpression. Nuclear CBP20 demonstrated a marked serum-dependent incorporation of [α-32P]GTP (Fig. 2 C). Given that the m7GpppN RNA cap structure is a known substrate for the CBC, the stimulated incorporation of [α-32P]GTP into CBP20 may reflect an enhanced ability of the CBC to bind the cap structure on RNA. To address this issue, we first examined the relative binding affinities of the CBC for different cap analogs by testing their ability to inhibit the incorporation of [α-32P]GTP into CBP20. PC12 cell nuclear lysates were immunoprecipitated with antibodies generated against CBP80 (i.e. the binding partner of CBP20) (7Izaurralde E. Lewis J. McGuigan C. Jankowska M. Darzynkiewicz E. Mattaj I.W. Cell. 1994; 78: 657-668Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar), and the immunoprecipitates were then assayed for photocatalyzed incorporation of [α-32P]GTP into CBP20 in the absence and presence of RNA cap analogs or GTP. CBP20 proteins that co-immunoprecipitated with CBP80 could be efficiently labeled with [α-32P]GTP. This activity was strongly inhibited by the addition of low concentrations of cap analogs to the [α-32P]GTP cross-linking assay and yielded the following binding specificity: m7GpppG > m7GTP > GpppG > GTP (Fig. 3 A). Indeed, the m7GpppG analog competed with [α-32P]GTP for binding to CBP20 ∼1000 times more effectively than GTP, suggesting that the CBC most likely binds RNA, rather than GTP, in cells. We further examined whether the CBC shows a regulated binding to capped RNAs using a PC12 cell line that stably expresses HA-tagged CBP20. Following starvation, these cells were stimulated with NGF. HA-CBP20 was then immunoprecipitated from the cytoplasmic and nuclear lysates and assayed for the incorporation of either [α-32P]GTP (Fig. 3 B, upper panel) or m7G32pppN-capped RNA (lower panel). Both substrates were incorporated into nuclear HA-CBP20 strictly in a growth factor-dependent manner. Thus, these findings indicate that the growth factor-stimulated incorporation of [α-32P]GTP into CBP20 accurately reflects the activation of the CBC, such that it is induced to bind m7GpppN-capped RNAs. We took further advantage of the high"

After import into the chloroplast, the precursor protein is processed to a polyprotein in which each “mature” protein is preceded by an additional hydrophobic region; we show that these regions function as signal peptides that are cleaved after insertion into the thylakoid membrane. Inhibition of the first or second signal cleavage reaction by enlargement of the −1 residues leads in each case to the accumulation of a thylakoid-integrated intermediate containing three hydrophobic regions after import into chloroplasts; a double mutant is converted to a protein containing all four hydrophobic regions.

We also show that this polyprotein can insert into the thylakoid membrane in the absence of stromal factors, nucleoside triphosphates, or a functional Sec apparatus; this effectively shows for the first time that a multispanning protein can insert posttranslationally without the aid of signal recognition particle, SecA, or the membrane-bound Sec machinery.

The biogenesis of integral membrane proteins has attracted a great deal of experimental attention in recent years, in an effort to understand the mechanisms used to transfer hydrophobic regions from an aqueous milieu into the membrane bilayer and to achieve the correct final topology. Many of these studies have used bacterial proteins as model systems, and the emerging evidence points to the operation of two broad types of insertion mechanism, which can be classified as “assisted” and “spontaneous.” Some proteins clearly rely on the membrane-bound elements of the Sec apparatus used for the export of proteins into the periplasm, although the extrinsic SecA ATPase appears to be used to a lesser extent unless large hydrophilic loops require translocation across the membrane (1Andersson H. von Heijne G.

Valent Q.A. von Heijne G. Luirink J. FEBS Lett. 1997; 408: 1-4Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 5De Gier J.-W.L. Mansournia P. Valent Q.A. Phillips G.J. Luirink J. von Heijne G.

Bernstein H.D. Cell. 1997; 88: 187-196Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). Cross-linking studies suggest that this ribonucleoprotein particle binds preferentially to highly hydrophobic regions, consistent with a role in membrane protein targeting (8Valent Q.A. de Gier J.-W.L. von Heijne G. Kendall D.A. ten Hagen-Jongman C.M. Oudega B. Luirink J. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 25: 53-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). One such SRP-dependent protein has been shown to be inserted via the membrane-bound SecYEG complex, and it appears likely that most, if not all, SRP substrates will follow this route (9De Gier J.-W.L. Scotti P.A. Sääf A. Valent Q.A. Kuhn A. Luirink J. von Heijne G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 4646-4651Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Other proteins are inserted by different means. The coat proteins of the M13 and pf3 phages have been shown to insert into theEscherichia coli plasma membrane by mechanisms that do not involve either SRP or the Sec machinery, and it has been proposed that these proteins insert spontaneously into the membrane (reviewed in Ref.10Kuhn A. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 1995; 17: 185-190Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It should be noted though that other, as yet undefined membrane proteins could possibly assist in the insertion of this class of proteins (none of these proteins have been shown to insert with the correct topology into protein-free liposomes from an aqueous phase). A small number of other membrane proteins have similarly been proposed to follow either Sec- or SRP-independent insertion pathways (seee.g. Ref. 11Brassilana M. Gwidzek C. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5202-5208Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), but in general, these studies have been carried out in vivo using Sec- or SRP-depleted cells, and the precise insertion requirements are difficult to monitor under these conditions. For example, one membrane protein previously designated “Sec-independent” using a SecY-deficient strain has recently been shown to be absolutely reliant on the Sec machinery in a SecE depletion strain that exhibits a stronger phenotype (9De Gier J.-W.L. Scotti P.A. Sääf A. Valent Q.A. Kuhn A. Luirink J. von Heijne G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 4646-4651Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Partly as a result of these problems, relatively few membrane proteins have been definitively shown to insert by Sec/SRP-independent mechanisms, and it has remained unclear whether this type of mechanism is widely used. The chloroplast thylakoid membrane has emerged as an useful alternative system for this type of study because, although genetic analysis is more difficult, in vitro insertion assays have proved to be relatively facile (reviewed in Ref. 12Robinson C. Hynds P.J. Robinson D. Mant A. Plant Mol. Biol. 1998; 38: 209-221Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Again, two basic types of insertion mechanism have been characterized for the biogenesis of membrane proteins. The multispanning light-harvesting chlorophyll-binding protein (LHCP) of photosystem II is imported into the chloroplast by means of an envelope transit signal, after which it integrates into the thylakoid membrane by means of information contained in the mature protein (13Lamppa G.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 14996-14999Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14Viitanen P.V. Doran E.R. Dunsmuir P. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 15000-15007Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This process requires stromal SRP (cpSRP54) and nucleoside triphosphates (NTPs), and hence the overall insertion process may well resemble bacterial SRP-dependent insertion events (15Li X. Henry R. Yuan J. Cline K. Hoffman N.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3789-3793Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 16Hoffman N.E. Franklin A. Plant Physiol. 1994; 105: 295-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). However, it should be noted that an RNA molecule has yet to be identified in chloroplast SRP, and certain aspects of the insertion process may therefore differ. Proteolysis of thylakoids destroys their ability to integrate LHCP (17Robinson D. Karnauchov I. Herrmann R.G. Klösgen R.B. Robinson C. Plant J. 1996; 10: 149-155Crossref Scopus (41) Google Scholar), indicating that membrane-bound protein transport apparatus is required (probably the thylakoidal Sec machinery, although this remains to be confirmed). A very different insertion process has been demonstrated for a series of abundant single-spanning thylakoid membrane proteins: subunit II of the CFo assembly of the ATP synthase (CFoII) and the X and W subunits of photosystem II (PsbX and PsbW). In contrast to LHCP (and most other multispanning proteins), these proteins are synthesized with bipartite presequences in which the usual envelope transit peptide is followed by a cleavable signal peptide. Signal peptides usually specify an interaction with protein translocation systems, and most thylakoid lumen proteins are synthesized with this type of peptide and translocated by either a Sec- or ΔpH-dependent translocase in the thylakoid membrane (reviewed in Ref. 12Robinson C. Hynds P.J. Robinson D. Mant A. Plant Mol. Biol. 1998; 38: 209-221Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, CFoII, PsbW, and PsbX have all been shown to insert into thylakoids in the absence of SecA, SRP, or NTPs, and proteolysis of thylakoids has been shown to block Sec-dependent transport but have no effect on the insertion of the above proteins (17Robinson D. Karnauchov I. Herrmann R.G. Klösgen R.B. Robinson C. Plant J. 1996; 10: 149-155Crossref Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 18Michl D. Robinson C. Shackleton J.B. Herrmann R.G. Klösgen R.B.

Mant A. FEBS Lett. 1998; 424: 105-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). These findings represent strong evidence that neither SRP nor the Sec apparatus is required, and it has been proposed that these proteins may insert spontaneously into the thylakoid membrane. In this insertion mechanism, the proposed role of the signal peptide is to provide an additional hydrophobic section, which, together with the corresponding region in the mature protein, is able to partition into the membrane and drive the transport of the hydrophilic region (the N terminus of the mature protein) into the lumen. Cleavage by the thylakoidal processing peptidase (TPP) on thetrans side of the membrane then yields the mature protein. Inhibition of the processing step has been shown to generate such a loop intermediate (22Thompson S.J. Kim S.J. Robinson C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18979-18983Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) akin to that involved in the insertion of M13 procoat (10Kuhn A. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 1995; 17: 185-190Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To date, only simple, single-span proteins have been definitively shown to insert into bacterial or thylakoid membranes by SRP/Sec-independent mechanisms, raising the possibility that these factors tend to be recruited for more complex proteins and that the biogenesis of multispanning proteins may thus be rather more involved in general terms. In this report, we describe the insertion pathway for a thylakoid membrane polyprotein. Mant and Robinson (23Mant A. Robinson C. FEBS Lett. 1998; 423: 183-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) characterized an unusual Arabidopsis thaliana cDNA encoding a protein that contains two separate regions bearing high homology toycf32 open reading frames encoded by several algal plastid genomes. Whereas ycf32 genes encode small single-span proteins, the Arabidopsis protein was predicted to contain four hydrophobic regions, and it was proposed that this was in effect a polyprotein of two separate Ycf32-related proteins, each of which was preceded by a signal-type peptide. It has now been shown that the two proteins are indeed found in thylakoids, associated with photosystem II, and the gene has been designated psbY (24Gau A.E. Thole H.H. Sokolenko A. Altschmied L. Herrmann R.G. Pistorius E.K. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1998; 260: 56-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The individual polypeptides are designated PsbY-A1 and PsbY-A2. Here we describe a complex insertion/maturation pathway for PsbY that involves the use of two separate cleavable signal peptides, and we show that the entire polyprotein can insert into the thylakoid membrane by an SRP/Sec-independent mechanism. Oligonucleotide-directed, site-specific mutagenesis was carried out on the Arabidopsis cDNA encoding pYcf32/pPsbY used in the study of Mant and Robinson (23Mant A. Robinson C. FEBS Lett. 1998; 423: 183-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), using the inverse polymerase chain reaction method (25Hemsley A. Arnheim N. Toney M.D. Cortopassi G. Galas D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 6545-6553Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar). 35-Mer primers were used to alter the following Ala codons to Thr as follows: mutant PsbY/1 (see under “Results”), codon 66 from GCC → ACC; PsbY/1*, codon 78 from GCC → ACC; PsbY/2, codon 143 from GCT → ACT; PsbY/2*, codon 150 from GCT → ACT. In mutant PsbY/1/Leu, codon 66 was altered to CUC (Leu). The construct encoding pre-A2 was synthesized by polymerase chain reaction amplification of the ArabidopsiscDNA region encoding signal 2 and protein A2. The forward primer (5′-GAG AGT AAA CAT ATG GTT GTT GGT CTA GG-3′) introduced anNdeI restriction site at glycine 118, altering it to methionine. The reverse primer (5′-CGT AAG CTT GGA TCC TCT AGA GCG GC-3′) took advantage of the preexisting NotI linker restriction site in the cDNA template. The amplified region was cloned 5′ NdeI-NotI 3′ under control of the SP6 promoter of pGEM®5Zf (Promega) and completely sequenced before being used as a template for in vitro transcription and translation. Precursor proteins were synthesized in vitro by transcription of cDNA clones followed by translation in a wheat germ lysate in the presence of [35S]methionine or [3H]leucine as detailed by Mant and Robinson (23Mant A. Robinson C. FEBS Lett. 1998; 423: 183-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) and Robinson et al. (17Robinson D. Karnauchov I. Herrmann R.G. Klösgen R.B. Robinson C. Plant J. 1996; 10: 149-155Crossref Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Assays for the import of proteins by intact chloroplasts and isolated pea thylakoids were as in the same references; a more complete description of the thylakoid import assay is given in Brock et al. (26Brock I.W. Hazell L. Michl D. Nielsen V.S. Møller B.L. Herrmann R.G. Klösgen R.B. Robinson C. Plant Mol. Biol. 1993; 23: 717-725Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Apyrase (Sigma, type VI) was used to deplete the import incubation of NTPs using a protocol adapted from (27Hulford A. Hazell L. Mould R.M. Robinson C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3251-3256Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Twice-washed thylakoids (30 μg of chlorophyll for the experiment shown in Fig. 6; 20 μg of chlorophyll for the experiment shown in Fig. 7) resuspended in stromal extract were incubated for 10 min on ice with either 4 units of apyrase or 4 units of inactivated enzyme (100 °C for 10 min). Next, 10 μl of puromycin-treated translation mixture (see below) was added to the thylakoids on ice and incubated for a further 10 min before being transferred to the light bath for 30 min. The final volume of each incubation was 50 μl, and stromal extract was present at 1.3× the equivalent concentration of chlorophyll. Import buffer was 10 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 8.0, 5 mm MgCl2 (HM buffer). Postincubation, the thylakoids were washed and analyzed directly (by mixing with protein sample buffer), after protease treatment with thermolysin at 0.2 mg ml−1 for 40 min on ice, or after washing the membranes with urea (see below).Figure 7Stromal factors and NTPs stimulate but are not a prerequisite for the insertion of PsbY into thylakoids. pPsbY and pre-A2 were incubated with pea thylakoids in the presence or absence of stromal extract as indicated; other incubations with (+) or without (−) stromal extract were preincubated with 4 units of apyrase as described in Fig. 6. Control incubations contained the same amount of boiled apyrase. Samples were analyzed of the thylakoids after incubation; symbols are as in Fig. 6.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) In order to avoid nonspecific association of precursor proteins with thylakoid membranes, in vitro translation mixtures were treated with 0.1 mg ml−1 puromycin (to dissociate ribosomes) for 2 min at room temperature, at the end of the translation incubation. The translation mixture was then centrifuged at 100,000 ×g for 20 min at 4 °C to pellet any aggregated proteins. The resulting supernatant was used in thylakoid insertion assays. These analyses were carried out essentially as described by Breyton et al. (28Breyton C. de Vitry C. Popot J.-L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7597-7602Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thylakoid membranes (10–20 μg of chlorophyll) were washed in ice-cold 20 mm Tricine-NaOH, pH 8.0, resuspended in a freshly prepared solution of 6.8 m urea/20 mmTricine-NaOH, pH 8.0, and incubated for 10 min at room temperature (around 22 °C). The samples were then subjected to two cycles of freeze-thawing (dry ice-room temperature) and centrifuged at 120,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C in a Beckman TL100 ultracentrifuge using a TLA100.3 rotor. Care was taken to remove the top 80 μl of supernatant without disturbing the membrane pellet. The remaining 20 μl of supernatant was discarded. The pellet was then resuspended once more in 100 μl of urea solution, and the whole process was repeated. The second extraction rarely removed any extra material from the thylakoid membranes. Samples of the final membrane pellet and the first supernatant (equivalent volumes loaded), along with the other assay samples, were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue and fluorography. The protocol was as described by Robinson et al. (17Robinson D. Karnauchov I. Herrmann R.G. Klösgen R.B. Robinson C. Plant J. 1996; 10: 149-155Crossref Scopus (41) Google Scholar) with the following modifications. After treating the thylakoids with 60 μg ml−1 trypsin (Sigma, type XIII) for 10 min on ice, the digestion was stopped by the addition of 120 μg ml−1 trypsin inhibitor (Sigma, type I-S), and the thylakoids reisolated by centrifugation at 100,000 × gfor 10 min at 4 °C. The thylakoids were washed twice in HM plus 60 μg ml−1 trypsin inhibitor (centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C) and finally resuspended in stromal extract (for pPsbY and pre-A2) or HM buffer (p23K). Each sample contained thylakoids equivalent to 20 μg of chlorophyll, 0.5 mm MgATP, and 10 μl of translation mixture all buffered by HM (final volume, 50 μl). Stromal extract, when present, was at a concentration equivalent to 1.3× the chlorophyll concentration. The import/insertion incubation was carried out under a green safelight, for 30 min at 26 °C, and the prevailing ΔpH was measured by 9-aminoacridine fluorescence quenching as described (17Robinson D. Karnauchov I. Herrmann R.G. Klösgen R.B. Robinson C. Plant J. 1996; 10: 149-155Crossref Scopus (41) Google Scholar); this was found to be invariably over 2 units. A stock solution of 0.2 m HgCl2 was prepared as described by Reedet al. (29Reed J.E. Cline K. Stephens L.C. Bacot K.O. Viitanen P.V. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 194: 33-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Aliquots of intact chloroplasts from an import assay (30 μl; 10 μg of chlorophyll) were mixed with 2 μl of HgCl2 at each sampling time. Chloroplasts were pelleted by centrifugation at 2000 × g for 2 min at 4 °C, as soon as possible after mixing with HgCl2. They were then gently resuspended in 1 ml of 50 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 8.0, 330 mm sorbitol, 10 mm EDTA, recentrifuged, and finally resuspended in the latter buffer plus protein sample buffer. Our initial aim in this study was to determine whether the psbYgene product is indeed processed to two small single-span proteins through the use of dual signal peptides as proposed in Ref. 23Mant A. Robinson C. FEBS Lett. 1998; 423: 183-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar. Fig.1 shows the overall primary structure of the full precursor protein (which we term pPsbY) encoded by theArabidopsis psbY cDNA protein, in which the structure is divided into five domains. The predicted sequence reveals an apparently typical stroma-targeting envelope transit that is basic, hydrophilic, and enriched in hydroxylated residues. This is followed by the initial “mature” protein (PsbY), which contains four hydrophobic regions: (i) a predicted signal peptide, (ii) a region that is closely homologous to algal ycf32 open reading frames (protein A1), (iii) a second possible signal peptide, and (iv) a second region homologous to single-span Ycf32 proteins (protein A2). Thylakoid signal peptides are cleaved by a membrane-bound, lumen-facing TPP activity that cleaves after short-chain residues at the −3 and −1 positions in the substrate relative to the processing site; the presence of Ala at −1 is essential for efficient cleavage (30Shackleton J.B. Robinson C. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 12152-12156Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Ala is also usually found at the −3 position. Hydrophobic regions i and iii above were considered to be possible signal peptides on the basis that these regions are followed by potential Ala-X-Ala TPP cleavage sites. We first sought to clarify whether the internal hydrophobic region iii is in fact a cleavable signal peptide. The cDNA coding region for hydrophobic regions iii and iv was amplified using polymerase chain reaction and an ATG codon incorporated at the 5′-end in order to synthesize and import the second section of the PsbY polypeptide. This construct is termed pre-A2. The import of wild-type pPsbY into chloroplasts is shown as a time course analysis in Fig.2 A. In order to identify possible processing intermediates, the samples were rapidly treated with HgCl2, which has been shown to inhibit import/processing events in studies on other chloroplast proteins (29Reed J.E. Cline K. Stephens L.C. Bacot K.O. Viitanen P.V. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 194: 33-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar,31Henry R. Kapazoglou A. McCaffery M. Cline K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10189-10192Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Fig. 2 A shows that the 23-kDa precursor protein, which migrates as 19 kDa in this gel system, is processed to two small polypeptides with mobilities of 6 and 7 kDa, as found by Mant and Robinson (23Mant A. Robinson C. FEBS Lett. 1998; 423: 183-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). However, other processing products are apparent, including the initial processed, imported form (PsbY), which migrates just below the precursor protein (see below). The pre-A2 construct can not be imported into chloroplasts because it lacks an envelope transit peptide, and we therefore used assays for the import of proteins into isolated pea thylakoids. Fig. 2 Bshows that this construct is inserted and processed to a smaller product, providing strong evidence that the construct does indeed contain a cleavable signal peptide. This product has precisely the same mobility as the upper band from a chloroplast import reaction (Fig.2 B, mark), and we therefore assign this upper band to protein A2. These data provide further compelling evidence that pPsbY is processed to two individual single-span proteins. The above data and sequence information strongly suggest that pPsbY contains a total of four hydrophobic regions, including two cleavable signal peptides. Because TPP is known to be active on the lumenal side of the thylakoid membrane, this protein offers attractive possibilities in terms of identifying the topology of the polypeptide chain during membrane insertion. In order to address this topic more directly, we took advantage of the highly precise nature of the TPP reaction, by substituting Thr residues at possible −1 positions. This markedly inhibits the TPP processing reaction (22Thompson S.J. Kim S.J. Robinson C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18979-18983Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 30Shackleton J.B. Robinson C. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 12152-12156Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and we reasoned that this would lead to the identification of defined intermediates on the PsbY biogenesis pathway. Any observed inhibition would furthermore help to define these cleavable peptides as substrates for TPP because only minor, single substitutions were made at each site, and identical substitutions had no effect on the insertion of loop structures in pre-PsbW or pre-PsbX (22Thompson S.J. Kim S.J. Robinson C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18979-18983Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Both terminal Ala residues were therefore altered to Thr by site-specific mutagenesis of the cDNA clone (the relevant residues are shown in Fig. 1, italicized and underlined). In addition, a mutant was made in which both sites were disrupted (PsbY/1,2). Two further potential TPP cleavage sites were also identified, and the −1 Ala residues mutated to Thr; these mutants were designated PsbY/1* and PsbY/2*, as shown in Fig. 1. Finally, we addressed the possibility that the presence of a Thr residue might affect the translocation of the intervening regions as well their removal by TPP. This was, in our view, extremely unlikely because Thr residues had no detectable effect on the rate of insertion insertion of PsbX or PsbW into the the thylakoid membrane or on the translocation of the hydrophilic section into the lumen (22Thompson S.J. Kim S.J. Robinson C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18979-18983Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, we tested this possibility directly by altering the −1 Ala at the first predicted cleavage site to Leu on the basis that this would similarly prevent cleavage by TPP, while having no predicted effect on insertion (if anything, the more hydrophobic Leu residue should enhance insertion). This mutation is designated PsbY/1/Leu. Analyses of several of the PsbY mutants are shown in Fig.3. All of the mutant proteins are imported by isolated chloroplasts and found exclusively in the thylakoid fraction. The import and processing profiles of mutants PsbY/1* and PsbY2* were found to be exactly as those shown in Fig. 1for the wild-type protein (data not shown), strongly indicating that these mutations do not lie at TPP cleavage sites. However, the remaining mutants exhibit severe defects in processing. PsbY/2 is imported and converted to a 10.8-kDa product, as shown in Fig. 3,top panel. Clearly, the Thr residue prevents cleavage at the second site by TPP, and a larger polypeptide accumulates. There is, however, good evidence that the first signal peptide has been cleaved because the mobility of the protein is consistent with a three-span protein rather than a protein containing all four hydrophobic regions (see below) PsbY/1 is imported and converted to three polypeptides, one of apparently mature size (7 kDa) together with a processing intermediate (designated int), which migrates as 10.2 kDa. The 7-kDa protein co-migrates with protein A2 from chloroplast import assays with the wild-type protein or from thylakoid import assays using pre-A2 (see below), and we therefore conclude that the A2 protein is correctly removed from the PsbY/1 polyprotein upon insertion. Almost no A1 is formed, however, indicating that the presence of the Thr residue has a drastic effect on the release of this protein and providing very strong evidence that the first hydrophobic region is in fact a cleavable signal peptide that is recognized by TPP. Identical data were obtained for the PsbY/1/Leu mutant (not shown), indicating that the appearance of the PsbY/1 intermediate reflects an inhibition of processing rather than any difficulty of translocating the more hydrophilic Thr residue across the membrane. A larger polypeptide was also apparent in this experiment (denoted by an arrow), but the identity of this band is unclear because it is usually present in lower quantities and is sometimes virtually absent (see, for example, the PsbY/1 import results in Fig.4). In contrast, the 10."

Previously, amino acids located in the active site of heparinase I have been identified and mapped. In an effort to further understand the mechanism by which heparinase I cleaves its polymer substrate, we sought to understand the role of calcium, as a necessary cofactor, in the enzymatic activity of heparinase I. Specifically, we undertook a series of biochemical and biophysical experiments to answer the question of whether heparinase I binds to calcium and, if so, which regions of the protein are involved in calcium binding. Using the fluorescent calcium analog terbium, we found that heparinase I tightly bound divalent and trivalent cations. Furthermore, we established that this interaction was specific for ions that closely approximate the ionic radius of calcium. Through the use of the modification reagentsN-ethyl-5-phenylisoxazolium-3′-sulfonate (Woodward's reagent K) and 1-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-3-ethylcarbodiimide hydrochloride, we showed that the interaction between heparinase I and calcium was essential for proper functioning of the enzyme. Preincubation with either calcium alone or calcium in the presence of heparin was able to protect the enzyme from inactivation by these modifying reagents. In addition, through mapping studies of Woodward's reagent K-modified heparinase I, we identified two putative calcium-binding sites, CB-1 (Glu207–Ala219) and CB-2 (Thr373–Arg384), in heparinase I that not only are specifically modified by Woodward's reagent K, leading to loss of enzymatic activity, but also conform to the calcium-coordinating consensus motif.

Heparin-like glycosaminoglycans, such as heparin and heparan sulfate, are acidic polysaccharides that play a role in many central biological processes, such as cell proliferation and signaling (1Jackson R.L. Busch S.J. Cardin A.D. Physiol. Rev. 1991; 71: 481-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (963) Google Scholar, 2Lindahl U. Lidholt K. Spillman D. Kjellen L. Thromb. Res. 1994; 75: 1-32Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). However, attempts to determine whether heparin-like glycosaminoglycans are involved in a particular biological process have been hampered by the lack of tools available to study these substrates. One such tool, under development in our laboratory, is the heparinases, bacterially derived lyases. Heparinase I from Flavobacterium heparinum is a 43-kDa enzyme that cleaves primarily heparin-like regions of heparin-like glycosaminoglycans (i.e. regions containing a high degree of sulfation with primarily iduronic acid as the uronic acid component) (3Ernst S.E.

Heparinase I has been used in a variety of circumstances to highlight the importance of heparin-like glycosaminoglycans in such diverse biological processes as angiogenesis (5Sasisekharan R.

Godavarti R. Sasisekharan R. Development (Camb.). 1997; 124: 2623-2632Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To extend the capabilities of the heparinases, we have undertaken a series of biochemical studies aimed at identifying important functional residues as well as elucidating the enzyme's mode of action. Through a combination of chemical modification, proteolytic mapping, and site-directed mutagenesis, we have identified Cys135 (7Sasisekharan R. Leckband D. Godavarti R. Venkataraman G. Cooney C.L. Langer R. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 14441-14448Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), His203 (8Godavarti R. Cooney C.L. Langer R. Sasisekharan R.

Chem. 1998; 273: 248-255Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) as amino acid residues important for heparinase I activity. Furthermore, using a matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization/mass spectrometry and capillary electrophoresis methodology, we discovered that the mode of action of heparinase I is primarily exolytic and processive,i.e. the enzyme preferentially cleaves first at the nonreducing end and then proceeds to cleave the substrate sequentially without releasing it (10Ernst S. Rhomberg A. Biemann K. Sasisekharan R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 4181-4186Crossref Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Previously, it has been noted that calcium is required for full heparinase I activity (11Sasisekharan R. Venkataraman G. Godavarti R. Ernst S. Cooney C.L. Langer R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3124-3131Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). One possible explanation for this observed increase is that heparinase I binds calcium and that this interaction in some way facilitates cleavage of the polymer substrate. However, it is also known that calcium interacts in a highly specific way with heparin, inducing a conformational change in the polymer chain (12Gabriel D.A. Carr M.E. Am. J. Med. Sci. 1980; 298: 8-14Crossref Scopus (12) Google Scholar,13Braud C. Vert M. Granger M. Int. J. Biol. Macromol. 1988; 10: 2-10Crossref Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Thus, another possibility is that heparinase I can act only on the calcium-induced conformation of heparin. If this were the case, then the enzymatic activity of heparinase I could be affected by increasing calcium concentration without any direct interaction between calcium and the enzyme. In an effort to further understand the role of calcium in heparinase I activity, we undertook a series of experiments to determine whether heparinase I binds calcium and, if so, at what sites and whether this interaction is important for the proper functioning of the enzyme. We sought to study the interaction and stoichiometry of calcium binding to heparinase I by a combination of fluorescence spectroscopy, chemical modification, and tryptic mapping. In this study, we find that calcium indeed binds heparinase I. Furthermore, through a combination of chemical modification and peptide mapping studies, we identify two calcium-coordinating motifs, with either one or both of these sites being important for the critical calcium-heparinase I interaction. In the accompanying study (14Liu D. Shriver Z. Godavarti R. Venkataraman G. Sasisekharan R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4089-4095Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), we use the information derived herein to design a series of site-directed mutants of the calcium-binding sites of heparinase I to identify particular amino acids involved in calcium binding and critical for proper enzymatic functioning.

A. 1993; 90: 3660-3664Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 16Yang V.C. Linhardt R.J. Bernstein H. Cooney C.L. Langer R. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 1849-1857Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The UV 232 nm assay to quantify heparinase I enzymatic activity was similar to that reported elsewhere (17Bernstein H. Yang V.C. Cooney C.L. Langer R. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 137: 515-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Briefly, the course of the reaction was monitored by measuring the increase in absorbance at 232 nm from the Δ4,5 bond of the product of heparinase cleavage as a function of time under saturating substrate concentrations. With heparin as the substrate, the reaction was carried out at a concentration of 4 mg/ml in 100 mm MOPS and 5 mm calcium acetate, pH 7.0. The temperature for all enzymatic activity measurements was kept constant at 30 °C. For the inactivation kinetic profiles, activity was measured as outlined above at precise time points after addition of the modifying reagent. The titrations of heparinase I with terbium were completed by adding aliquots of a terbium stock solution (in 10 mm MOPS and 0.1 mKCl, pH 6.5) to a solution containing heparinase I (4.6 μm). To maintain a constant protein concentration, the same amount of heparinase I (4.6 μm) was present in the terbium stock solution as was present in the cuvette. The concentration of the terbium solution was determined by EDTA titration in the presence of a xylenol orange indicator (18Lyle S.J. Rahman M. Talanta. 1963; 10: 1177-1182Crossref Scopus (362) Google Scholar). To ensure accurate readings, all solutions, except the terbium stock solution, were run through a chelating column (Chelex resin) to remove trace contaminants. After addition of a terbium aliquot, the sample was mixed and allowed to come to equilibrium for 15 min. Fluorescence measurements were recorded on a FluoroMax fluorescence spectrometer (Spex Industries, Edison, NJ). The geometry of fluorescence detection was 90°. All measurements were recorded using a quartz cell (Starna Cells) with a 1.0-cm path length, and the sample temperature was maintained at 25 °C using a circulating water bath. The excitation wavelength was either 488 nm (direct excitation of terbium) or 280 nm (excitation of nearby tyrosine residues); the emission wavelength was 545 nm. For the calcium competition titrations, to a solution of heparinase I (4.6 μm) plus 8 molar eq of terbium were added aliquots of a 50 mm calcium solution that also contained 4.6 μm heparinase I. After each addition, the solution was thoroughly mixed and allowed to stand for 15 min before a measurement was taken. In none of the experiments was protein precipitation evident. To determine the effect of Tb3+ and Lu3+ on heparinase I activity, heparinase I was preincubated for 15 min with increasing amounts of a solution of 10 mm MOPS and 0.1 mKCl, pH 6.5, with either Tb3+ and Lu3+. At this point, the activity of the heparinase I solution was measured using the 232 nm assay. The substrate solution was 4 mg/ml heparin and 5 mm calcium in 10 mm MOPS and 0.1 mKCl, pH 6.5. The concentrations of the lanthanide stock solutions were determined as outlined above. Control reactions were run in the absence of lanthanide. Upon addition of WRK to an enzyme solution, the actual agent that modifies nucleophilic amino acids is not WRK itself; rather WRK is converted into a reactive intermediate that binds to selective amino acids in a protein (19Llamas K. Owens M. Blakeley R.L. Zerner B. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1986; 108: 5543-5548Crossref Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Therefore, to accurately model the kinetics of WRK modification of heparinase I, it is necessary to know the concentration of this intermediate, the ketoketenimine, as a function of time. The concentration of the ketoketenimine can be determined by monitoring an aqueous solution of WRK at 340 nm, where the ketoketenimine is the only species of WRK that absorbs appreciably (ε = 4730 cm−1m−1) (19Llamas K. Owens M. Blakeley R.L. Zerner B. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1986; 108: 5543-5548Crossref Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 20Kuimov A.N. Kochetov G.A. Anal. Biochem. 1988; 172: 56-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (1) Google Scholar). At pH 7.0, the conversion of 50 μm WRK to the ketoketenimine and its subsequent degradation were determined in 100 mmMOPS by monitoring the change in absorbance at 340 nm every 30 s for 10 min. Stock solutions of WRK were made fresh with 0.1m HCl at 4 °C. A cuvette containing an equivalent amount of 0.1 m HCl instead of WRK was used as a blank. To determine the rate constants of formation (k″) and degradation (k′) of the ketoketenimine, Equation 1 was used. [I]=k“k”−k'[W]0e−k't−k“k”−k'[W]0e−k“tEquation 1 In this equation, t is the measured time, [I] is the concentration of the ketoketenimine intermediate, and [W]0 is the initial concentration of WRK (50 μm) (19Llamas K. Owens M. Blakeley R.L. Zerner B. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1986; 108: 5543-5548Crossref Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Heparinase I (30 μg/ml) was inactivated with 0.1–0.4 mm WRK at room temperature. The control mixture contained no WRK, but an equivalent amount of 0.1 m HCl. Reactions were carried out in 100 mm MOPS, pH 7.0. At fixed time intervals, aliquots were withdrawn for the UV 232 nm activity assay. The kinetics of WRK inactivation of heparinase I were determined by plotting the natural log of percent activity versus an adjusted time term (to account for the formation and decomposition of the ketoketenimine intermediate). This adjusted time term was calculated according to Equation 2. t″=k″k″−k′1−e−k′tk′−1−e−k″tk″Equation 2 To investigate the ability of Ca2+ to protect the enzyme against modification by WRK, heparinase I (30 μg/ml) was first incubated with different concentrations of Ca2+ (ranging from 100 μm to 20 mm) for 30 min at pH 7 before 50 μm WRK was added to the reaction mixtures. The time course of inactivation was then determined. An activity assay was also performed with a control mixture with no prior addition of Ca2+. Tryptic digests of heparinase I were performed essentially as described previously (7Sasisekharan R. Leckband D. Godavarti R. Venkataraman G. Cooney C.L. Langer R. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 14441-14448Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). To 16 μg of heparinase I was added 4 mmWRK; the sample was allowed to incubate for 30 min at room temperature. A 10-fold excess of glycine methyl ester was added to quench the reaction. The enzyme was then denatured in 50 μl of 8 murea and 0.4 m ammonium carbonate, reduced with 5 mm dithiothreitol at 65 °C, cooled to room temperature, and alkylated with 10 mm iodoacetamide for 15 min. The reaction was quenched with water by bringing the total reaction volume to 200 μl. To the above reaction was added 4% (w/w) trypsin, and the digestion was carried out at 37 °C for 24 h. The proteolytic reaction was terminated by freezing at −20 °C. The digest was separated using gradient reverse-phase HPLC (2–80% acetonitrile in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid for 120 min). Tryptic peptides were monitored at 210, 277, and 320 nm and collected. Based on the peptide peaks monitored at 320 nm, five peaks were collected and sequenced using an on-line Model 120 phenylthiohydantoin-derivative analyzer (Biopolymers Laboratory, Center for Cancer Research, Massachusetts Institute of Technology). To determine whether preincubation with calcium protected the enzyme from WRK modification, heparinase I was first incubated with 100 mm CaCl2 at room temperature. Heparinase I digests in the absence of WRK modification were included as controls. Fig.1 shows that, in the presence of millimolar concentrations of calcium, heparinase I activity was increased 5-fold, consistent with earlier observations (11Sasisekharan R. Venkataraman G. Godavarti R. Ernst S. Cooney C.L. Langer R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3124-3131Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). To address whether heparinase I itself binds calcium, we studied the interaction of Tb3+ with heparinase I in the absence of heparin. In this way, interactions of heparinase I with terbium could be studied independently of confounding factors associated with terbium-heparin interactions. Tb3+ is a lanthanide analog of calcium often used to probe the nature of protein interactions with calcium (21Brittain H.G. Richardson F.S. Martin R.B. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1976; 98: 8255-8260Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar, 22Martin R.B. Richardson F.S. Quar. Rev. Biophys. 1979; 12: 181-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). Tb3+ possesses an ionic radius that is very similar to that of calcium in aqueous solution and has the advantage that, unlike calcium, the protein-Tb3+ complex is fluorescent. In addition, because of the increase in charge properties of terbium compared with calcium (i.e. 3+ as opposed to 2+), terbium very often has a higher affinity for calcium-binding sites than does calcium itself. Upon titration of heparinase I with terbium, an increase in fluorescence was observed whether excitation was performed at 488 nm (direct excitation of the terbium adduct) or 280 nm (excitation of nearby tyrosine side chains, followed by energy transfer to the terbium adduct). Since, as has been observed with other protein systems, the fluorescence signal was enhanced upon indirect excitation at 280 nm, the most extensive studies were completed in this way (Fig.2). Fluorescence intensity increased upon titration of terbium to heparinase I until 10 eq had been added. Beyond this point, the fluorescence intensity did not increase further. To ensure that the terbium-heparinase I interaction was specific, the ability of calcium to compete with terbium for binding to heparinase I was investigated. As noted above, terbium very often can have a 1000-fold higher affinity than calcium for calcium-binding sites; therefore, a large excess of calcium is required to reduce the binding of terbium to a protein. In the case of heparinase I, after addition of 8 eq of terbium to heparinase I, calcium was added to the terbium/enzyme solution, and the fluorescence was measured. As shown in Fig. 3, addition of calcium concentrations up to 2 mm was able to compete terbium off of heparinase I. These results indicate that the interaction of terbium with heparinase I is specific and that this interaction substitutes for calcium binding to heparinase I. In an effort to confirm and extend the conclusions of the fluorescence study, the effect of terbium on heparinase I activity was determined. We found that heparinase I activity was inhibited in a dose-dependent fashion by terbium with a measured IC50 of 39 μm (Fig.4). This type of inhibition has been seen for other enzyme systems known to interact specifically with calcium (23Raser K.J. Buroker-Kilgore M. Wang K.K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1292: 9-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). The effect of another lanthanide, lutetium, on heparinase I activity was also investigated. The ionic radius of Lu3+ is smaller than that of Tb3+; therefore, we expected that Lu3+, a less suitable replacement for calcium in heparinase I, would be a less potent inhibitor of heparinase I activity (24Epstein M. Levitzki A. Reuben J. Biochemistry. 1974; 13: 1777-1781Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 25Evans C.H. Biochemistry of the Lanthanides. Plenum Press, New York1990Crossref Google Scholar). In fact, Lu3+ was also able to inhibit heparinase I activity; however, the IC50 was increased to 212 μm. Together with the fluorescence experiments, these results indicate that heparinase I interacts in a highly specific manner with terbium and, by extension, with calcium. Having determined that there is a specific calcium-heparinase I interaction, we set out to determine which sites in heparinase I could potentially bind calcium. To investigate the roles of calcium in the enzymatic activity of heparinase I, we used a combination of chemical modification coupled with protection experiments (to ensure the specificity of the reaction) and proteolytic mapping studies (to identify particular amino acids that are modified). To complete these studies and to identify the calcium-binding site(s) in heparinase I, we used two modification reagents (WRK and EDAC) that are specific for carboxylate groups. In the case of WRK, the active modification reagent is not WRK per se, but rather an unstable intermediate, the corresponding ketoketenimine (19Llamas K. Owens M. Blakeley R.L. Zerner B. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1986; 108: 5543-5548Crossref Scopus (27) Google Scholar). In an effort to understand the kinetics of heparinase I modification by WRK, the rates of formation and degradation of the ketoketenimine were followed by monitoring an aqueous solution of WRK at 340 nm. At this wavelength, the only species of WRK that possesses appreciable absorbance is the ketoketenimine (ε = 4730 cm−1 mm−1) (19Llamas K. Owens M. Blakeley R.L. Zerner B. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1986; 108: 5543-5548Crossref Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The results were fit to a nonlinear equation as outlined under “Experimental Procedures” (Fig. 5). The derived rate constants for the formation (0.061 s−1) and degradation (0.019 s−1) of the ketoketenimine were used to accurately determine the kinetics of heparinase I inactivation by WRK. Having determined the kinetics of ketoketenimine formation, the kinetics of WRK inactivation of heparinase I were studied. WRK was found to inhibit heparinase I in a dose-dependent fashion (Fig.6 A). Plotting the pseudo first-order rate constants as a function of the WRK concentration yielded a second-order rate constant of 7.9 mm−1 min−1 (Fig.6 B). To ensure that the reaction was specific for carboxylate-containing residues, the effect of another carboxylate-specific reagent (EDAC) on heparinase I activity was determined. Similar to what was seen for WRK, EDAC (in the millimolar range) was found to inhibit heparinase I in a dose-dependent fashion (data not shown). If WRK modifies the calcium-binding domain(s) of heparinase I, leading to inactivation because of disrupting interactions critical for proper enzymatic functioning, then preincubation with calcium, heparin, or both should offer some protection from inactivation. To determine whether this is the case, heparinase I was preincubated for 30 min with either heparin or heparin and 5 mm Ca2+ (Fig.7 A). Heparin was able to partially protect the enzyme from inactivation; however, preincubation with heparin and calcium was able to almost completely protect the enzyme from inactivation. Preincubation with increasing amounts of calcium was found to protect heparinase I from WRK-mediated inactivation, with a K 0.5 of 980 μm (Fig. 7 B). At large calcium concentrations, calcium alone (k inact = 2.1 min−1) protected heparinase I about half as well as heparin plus calcium (k inact = 1.2 min−1). WRK modification of specific amino acid residues forms covalent adducts that are stable to proteolytic mapping. In the presence of a suitable nucleophile, such as glycine methyl ester, the WRK-carboxylate adduct absorbs in the near-UV region (280–320 nm) (19Llamas K. Owens M. Blakeley R.L. Zerner B. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1986; 108: 5543-5548Crossref Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Therefore, the tryptic map of heparinase I was monitored at 210, 280, and 320 nm, and peaks with absorbance higher than that of the controls were collected. Fig.8 (A and B) shows the HPLC profile of the tryptic digest of heparinase I incubated with WRK monitored at 210 and 320 nm. In the chromatogram (Fig.8 B), the peptides eluting at 52 (td 52), 54 (td 54), 56.5 (td 56), 59 (td 59), and 95 min (td 95) were sequenced. The complete sequences of the peptides are shown in the figure legend, and their positions within the primary amino acid sequence of heparinase I are shown in Table I.Table IPrimary amino acid sequence of heparinase I (minus the leader sequence) and identification of WRK-modified peptides21 td 56 td 52 90MQQKKSGNIPYRVNVQADSAKQKAIIDNKWVAVGINKPYALQYDDKLRFNGKPSYRFELKAEDNSLEGYA91 163AGETKGRTELSYSYATTNDFKKFPPSVYQNAQKLKTVYHYGKGICEQGSSRSYTFSVYIPSSFPDNATTIFAQ164 td 54 td 59 233WHGAPSRTLVATPEGEIKTLSIEEFLALYDRMIFKKNIAHDKVEKKDKDG KITYVAGKPNGWKVEQGGYP234 304TLAFGFSKGYFYIKANSDRQWLTDKADRNNANPENSEVMKPYSSEYKTSTIAYKMPFAQFPKDCWITFDVA305 td 95 374IDWTKYGKEANTILKPGKLDVMMTYTKNKKPQKAHIVNQQEILIGRNDDDGYYFKFGIYRVGNSTVPVTY375 384NLSGYSETARBoldface sequences are those that conform to the calcium-chelating EF-hand motif (Table II).

The late eluting peak (td 95) was found to correspond to the C-terminal region of heparinase I. Two of the four clustered peaks (td 54 and td 59) were found to correspond to a region of the protein that overlapped with the primary heparin-binding site of heparinase I (11Sasisekharan R. Venkataraman G. Godavarti R. Ernst S. Cooney C.L. Langer R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3124-3131Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The other two peptides (td 52 and td 56) were found to be small peptides in the N-terminal region of heparinase I, both of which contain aspartate residues. Many studies have aimed at identifying consensus sequences for calcium-coordinating motifs, and most of these have focused on a particular calcium-coordinating motif, the EF-hand, present in many calcium-binding proteins (32Kretsinger R.H. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1987; 52: 499-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 33Moncrief N.D. Kretsinger R.H. Goodman M. J. Mol. Evol. 1990; 30: 522-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). To provide a framework for this study as well as for the accompanying site-directed mutagenesis study (14Liu D. Shriver Z. Godavarti R. Venkataraman G. Sasisekharan R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4089-4095Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), we set out to determine whether any of the WRK-labeled peptides conformed to an EF-hand motif. Table II lists the consensus sequence of the EF-hand calcium-coordinating motif. The canonical EF-hand consists of two α-helices interposed by a loop region that contains the calcium-chelating amino acids. These amino acids, identified asX, Y, Z, -Y, -X, and -Z in Table II (six ligands, typically in an octahedral geometry), chelate calcium either through an oxygen atom of a side chain or through a carbonyl atom of the peptide backbone. Examination of the modified tryptic peptides and comparison of their amino acid sequence with the EF-hand calcium-chelating consensus sequence (TableII) indicated that two of these modified peptides (viz. the C-terminal region of heparinase I and the region proximate to the heparin-binding site of heparinase I) share similarities with a EF-hand consensus sequence (30Maralihalli G.B. Bhagwat A.S. J. Protein Chem. 1993; 12: 451-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar) and could potentially bind calcium.Table IICalcium-coordinating motifs in heparinase IEF-hand homology135678912XYZG-YI-X-Zaaaamino acid.sequenceCB-1EKKDKDGKITYVACB-2VTYNLSGYSETARConsensusDXDXDGXISXXENNLTSVGDNEThe consensus sequence was derived from Ref. 32Kretsinger R.H.

Within the consensus sequence, boldface letters indicate the amino acids that have been observed among calcium binding proteins in decreasing order of frequency. The first site, hereafter referred to as CB-1, extends from Glu207 to Ala219 (Table II) and is proximate to the heparin-binding site that has also been shown to be critical for enzymatic functioning (11Sasisekharan R. Venkataraman G. Godavarti R. Ernst S. Cooney C.L. Langer R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3124-3131Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) and that contains His203, a putative active-site residue (8Godavarti R. Cooney C.L. Langer R. Sasisekharan R. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 6846-6852Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Within CB-1, the potential calcium-chelating amino acids include Glu207, Asp210, Asp212, and Thr216. The second site, hereafter referred to as CB-2, is at the C terminus of heparinase I, extending from Thr373 to Arg384. Like CB-1, CB-2 contains amino acids that could potentially bind calcium. These include Thr373, Asn375, Ser377, Ser380, and Glu381. More importantly, both CB-1 and CB-2 are modified by WRK/glycine methyl ester. To determine whether these peptides that were modified by WRK in the above experiment could be protected upon preincubation with calcium, 100 mm Ca2+ was added to heparinase I before addition of WRK and subsequent digestion. Under these conditions, td 54 and td 59 (corresponding to modification of CB-1) and td 95 (corresponding to modification of CB-2) were all protected from modification by preincubation with calcium, consistent with CB-1, CB-2, or both being involved in calcium binding by heparinase I. By a combination of biophysical and biochemical techniques, we have conclusively determined that heparinase I binds calcium. Furthermore, we have shown that the interaction between calcium and heparinase I is important for proper functioning of the enzyme, and we have mapped the calcium-binding regions of heparinase I. Fluorescence titration experiments have often been used to establish a specific interaction between calcium and a protein, including enzymes. We found that, in the presence of heparinase I, there is a fluorescence enhancement of terbium. This enhancement plateaus at a terbium/enzyme ratio of 10:1. To confirm that this interaction is specific for calcium, we found that terbium binding can be competed off by addition of an excess of calcium. Furthermore, terbium has a more pronounced effect on heparinase I activity than lutetium, a lanthanide with an ionic radius that does not as closely mimic that of calcium. Once again, by analogy to other enzyme systems, most notably trypsin (26De Jersey J. Lahue R.S. Martin R.B. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1980; 205: 536-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), this finding supports the notion of a specific calcium-heparinase interaction being important for enzymatic activity. To corroborate the findings of the terbium study, we studied the interaction of WRK with heparinase I. We found that heparinase I is inhibited by WRK in a dose-dependent manner, suggesting that WRK modifies carboxylate residues important for proper enzymatic functioning. WRK is well established in terms of its ability to modify glutamate and carboxylate amino acids (27Keresztessy Z. Kiss L. Hughes M.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1994; 314: 142-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 28Chauthaiwale J. Rao M. Biochim. Biophys.

Chem. 1995; 270: 10050-10055Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), which are especially prevalent in calcium-coordinating motifs. However, recent reports have highlighted the fact WRK can be nonspecific (30Maralihalli G.B. Bhagwat A.S. J. Protein Chem. 1993; 12: 451-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar, 31Bustos P. Gajardo M.I. Gomez C. Goldie H. Cardemil E. Jabalquinto A.M. J. Protein Chem. 1996; 15: 467-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). In fact, WRK can possibly react with other exposed nucleophiles, including surface-accessible histidines or cysteines. This was especially of concern in our case since it is known, from a previous study, that heparinase I contains an unusually nucleophilic cysteine residue, cysteine 135 (7Sasisekharan R. Leckband D. Godavarti R. Venkataraman G. Cooney C.L. Langer R. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 14441-14448Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Several lines of evidence support the supposition that WRK modifies carboxylate residues in heparinase I. First, preincubation with calcium was found to protect heparinase I from inactivation by WRK in a dose-dependent fashion. Second, EDAC, like WRK, was found to modify heparinase I. Finally, we mapped the residues that were modified by WRK. These mapping studies revealed that all the peptides contained carboxylate-containing amino acids. In addition, no peptides contained cysteine 135, indicating that, under these reaction conditions, WRK is specific for carboxylate-containing amino acids. Together, these findings support the notion that WRK modifies carboxylate-containing amino acids in the calcium-binding motifs of heparinase I. The protection data also clearly highlight another point, that in the enzymatic function of heparinase I, a ternary complex forms between heparin, calcium, and heparinase I. Preincubation with heparin and calcium protects heparinase I from modification by WRK almost entirely, whereas preincubation with either alone does not. Experiments in progress are aimed at addressing what role this ternary complex plays in heparinase activity (i.e. whether this complex is involved in enzyme stability, in the enzymatic cycle of heparinase I, or in some other necessary process). Thus, taken together, the chemical modification and fluorescence data clearly show that calcium binds to heparinase I and that this interaction is critical for proper functioning of heparinase I. In addition, the mapping studies implicate two sites on heparinase I that could potentially bind calcium, either one or both of which are critical for complete enzymatic activity. Both of the sites contain a number of amino acids with oxygen-containing side chains, especially glutamate and aspartate, the preferred chelating motifs for the hard acid Ca2+ (32Kretsinger R.H. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1987; 52: 499-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 33Moncrief N.D. Kretsinger R.H. Goodman M. J. Mol. Evol. 1990; 30: 522-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). In summary, the experiments outlined in this study have shown that heparinase I binds calcium and have identified two sites (CB-1 and CB-2) that play a role in calcium binding and mediating heparinase I activity. Thus, this study provides a framework for the mutagenesis work outlined in the accompanying study (14Liu D. Shriver Z. Godavarti R. Venkataraman G. Sasisekharan R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4089-4095Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). There, we set out, through a rigorous site-directed mutagenesis study, to delineate the importance of residues in CB-1 and CB-2 for the activity of heparinase I. We thank Dr. Ganesh Venkataraman for providing helpful comments and suggestions in the preparation of this manuscript."

In this study, through systematic site-directed mutagenesis, we have confirmed the accompanying biochemical studies and have shown that both CB-1 and CB-2 are involved in calcium binding and enzymatic activity. More specifically, we identified critical residues (viz.Asp210, Asp212, Gly213, and Thr216 in CB-1 and Asn375, Tyr379, and Glu381 in CB-2) that are important for calcium binding and heparinase I enzymatic activity. Mutations in CB-1 resulted in a lower k cat, but did not change the product profile of heparinase I action on heparin; conversely, mutations in CB-2 not only altered the k cat for heparinase I, but also resulted in incomplete degradation, leading to longer saccharides. Fluorescence competition experiments along with heparin affinity chromatography suggested that mutations in CB-1 alter heparinase I activity primarily through decreasing the enzyme's affinity for its calcium cofactor without altering heparin binding to heparinase I. Compared with CB-1 mutations, mutations in CB-2 affected calcium binding to a lesser extent, but they had a more pronounced effect on heparinase I activity, suggesting a different role for CB-2 in the enzymatic action of heparinase I. These results, taken together with our accompanying study, led us to propose a model for calcium binding to heparinase I that includes both CB-1 and CB-2 providing critical interactions, albeit via a different mechanism. Through binding to CB-1 and/or CB-2, we propose that calcium may play a role in the catalytic mechanism and/or in the exolytic processive mechanism of heparin-like glycosaminoglycan depolymerization by heparinase I. In the accompanying paper (Shriver, Z., Liu, D., Hu, Y., and Sasisekharan, R. (1999) J. Biol.

Heparin-like glycosaminoglycans (HLGAGs) 1The abbreviations used are: HLGAGs, heparin-like glycosaminoglycans; CB-1, calcium-binding site 1; CB-2, calcium-binding site 2; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid.1The abbreviations used are: HLGAGs, heparin-like glycosaminoglycans; CB-1, calcium-binding site 1; CB-2, calcium-binding site 2; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid., found both at the cell surface and in the extracellular matrix, bind to and regulate the biological activities of diverse molecules, including growth factors (1Kjellèn L. Lindahl U. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1991; 60: 443-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (1660) Google Scholar), thus influencing a range of physiological functions (2Jackson R.L. Busch S.J. Cardin A.D. Physiol. Rev. 1991; 71: 481-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (952) Google Scholar). HLGAGs are acidic polysaccharides, characterized by a disaccharide repeat unit of hexosamine and uronic acid (l-iduronic ord-glucuronic acid) connected through 1–4 linkages. Chemical heterogeneity in HLGAGs results from variation in the degree and distribution of sulfation. Heparinases I–III fromFlavobacterium heparinum degrade HLGAGs with unique specificity and are thus useful tools in understanding the structure, composition, and physiological roles of HLGAGs (3Sasisekharan R.

Moreover, heparinases have important clinical applications, such as in the monitoring of heparin levels in blood (approved by the Food and Drug Administration) (7Tejidor L. Oman D. Zimmermann J. Russo A. Rose M. Borzhemskaya L. Pelzer H. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1993; 69: 866Google Scholar), in the neutralization of heparin in blood (in phase III clinical trials), and in the production of low molecular weight heparins for use in humans. In addition, heparinases I and III have been shown to be potent inhibitors of angiogenesis (8Sasisekharan R. Moses M.A. Nugent M.A. Cooney C.L. Langer R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1524-1528Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). To determine structure-activity relationships for heparinase I, we are attempting to understand the mode of heparin degradation by heparinase I both at a mechanistic level and by identifying critical amino acids in the heparinase I active site through extensive biochemical and mutagenesis approaches (3Sasisekharan R.

Through extensive site-directed mutagenesis studies, we identified other positively charged residues (Lys132 and Lys198) that provide the necessary microenvironment for heparinase I catalysis (12Godavarti R. Sasisekharan R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 248-255Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Recent studies of heparin degradation by heparinase I revealed a processive catalytic mechanism in which heparin is predominantly degraded exolytically from the nonreducing end (13Ernst S. Rhomberg A.J. Biemann K. Sasisekharan R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 4182-4187Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). In the accompanying study (19Shriver Z. Liu D. Hu Y. Sasisekharan R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4082-4088Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), by using the fluorescent calcium analog terbium, we found that heparinase I binds calcium specifically. In addition, we have shown that Woodward's reagent K and 1-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-3-ethylcarbodiimide hydrochloride can inactivate heparinase I, whereas preincubation with calcium and/or heparin affords protection from inactivation. Thus, it is clear that the interaction between heparinase I and calcium is essential for the proper functioning of the enzyme. Finally, tryptic mapping studies of Woodward's reagent K-modified heparinase I revealed two putative calcium-binding sites in heparinase I, CB-1 and CB-2. As part of a primary heparin-binding site (residues 196–221), CB-1 contains residues 207–219 (19Shriver Z. Liu D. Hu Y. Sasisekharan R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4082-4088Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). CB-2 is located at the C terminus of heparinase I, spanning residues 373–384 (19Shriver Z. Liu D. Hu Y. Sasisekharan R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4082-4088Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Preincubation with calcium also protected CB-1 and CB-2 from being modified by Woodward's reagent K. We therefore suggest that either or both calcium-binding sites play an important role in calcium binding and/or enzymatic activity. In this paper, we confirm and extend the biochemical studies by identifying important calcium-coordinating residues in both CB-1 and CB-2. Furthermore, by analyzing the effects of mutations in CB-1 and CB-2 on enzymatic activity, calcium and heparin binding as well as the distribution and amount of different products formed from heparin degradation, we sought to outline possible roles for calcium in heparinase I activity. Heparin (from porcine intestinal mucosa with an average molecular mass of 13 kDa and an activity of >150 USP units/mg) was from Celcus Laboratories (Cincinnati, OH). Urea, dithiothreitol, and acetonitrile were from Allied Chemicals (Deerfield, IL). Molecular mass standards were obtained from Life Technologies, Inc. The fluorescence probe rhod-5N was obtained from Molecular Probes, Inc. (Eugene, OR). Chelex resin was purchased from Bio-Rad. All other chemicals were from Sigma. The Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) host was from Novagen (Madison, WI). Molecular biology reagents and their sources are listed in the appropriate sections below. The mutations were introduced via 12-cycle polymerase chain reaction by the method of Higuchi (14Higuchi R. PCR Protocols: A Guide to Methods and Applications. Academic Press, Inc., San Diego, CA1990Google Scholar). All mutant genes were cloned into pET-15b and were sequenced to verify the mutations as described previously (9Sasisekharan R. Leckband D. Godavarti R. Venkataraman G. Cooney C.L. Langer R. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 14441-14448Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Mutant recombinant heparinases I were expressed without the putative F. heparinum leader sequence, i.e. as a construct (−L recombinant heparinase I) that reads Met-Gln22-Gln23- (3Sasisekharan R. Bulmer M. Moremen K.W. Cooney C.L. Langer R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 3660-3664Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). To facilitate purification, the heparinase I gene was expressed using the pET-15b system (Novagen). This construct has a polyhistidine tag and a thrombin cleavage site in a 21-amino acid N-terminal leader sequence (9Sasisekharan R. Leckband D. Godavarti R. Venkataraman G. Cooney C.L. Langer R. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 14441-14448Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). All mutant recombinant heparinases were constructed in the pET-15b expression system and expressed and purified in the BL21(DE3) host as described previously (9Sasisekharan R. Leckband D. Godavarti R. Venkataraman G. Cooney C.L. Langer R. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 14441-14448Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was carried out using 12% gels and a Mini Protean II apparatus and stained with the Silver Stain Plus kit (9Sasisekharan R. Leckband D. Godavarti R. Venkataraman G. Cooney C.L. Langer R. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 14441-14448Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The level of protein expression for all recombinant heparinases was identical in the BL21(DE3) host (data not shown). The kinetic parameters k cat andK m were determined for all mutants as described previously (4Ernst S.E. Venkataraman G. Winkler S. Godavarti R. Langer R. Cooney C. Sasisekharan R. Biochem. J. 1996; 315: 589-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). A fluorescence competition study was conducted in selected mutants to determine their calcium binding property. The product profiles of heparin degradation were characterized using anion-exchange HPLC (POROS) to resolve the oligosaccharide products as described (3Sasisekharan R. Bulmer M. Moremen K.W. Cooney C.L. Langer R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 3660-3664Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The UV 232 nm assay was performed essentially as described previously (3Sasisekharan R. Bulmer M. Moremen K.W. Cooney C.L. Langer R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 3660-3664Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 15Bernstein J. Yang V.C. Cooney C.L. Langer R. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 137: 515-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Briefly, the enzymatic activity was directly measured from the increase in absorbance at 232 nm as a function of time. All assays were performed at 30 °C. When measuring the enzymatic activity as a function of heparin concentration, heparin concentrations varied from 0 to 4 mg/ml at a fixed calcium concentration of 5 mm (100 mmMOPS and 5 mm calcium acetate, pH 7.0). The data were then fit to a nonlinear equation to determine K catand K m of heparinases I. Mutant heparinase activity was also investigated as a function of calcium concentration ranging from 0 to 10 mm. These data were also fit to a nonlinear function to determine K 0.5, i.e. the calcium concentration at which half of the maximum enzymatic activity was observed. Activity is expressed as international units/micromoles of product formed per minute using ε = 3800m−1 cm−1. Heparin (4 mg/ml) was incubated with –L recombinant heparinase I or mutant enzymes in 100 mm MOPS and 5 mm calcium acetate buffer, pH 7.0, for 18 h. The reaction was terminated and subjected to anion-exchange HPLC to resolve the oligosaccharide products as described (3Sasisekharan R. Bulmer M. Moremen K.W. Cooney C.L. Langer R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 3660-3664Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The heparin-POROS chromatography study of heparinases I was essentially carried out following the procedure described previously (12Godavarti R. Sasisekharan R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 248-255Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Briefly, ∼30–40 μg of −L recombinant heparinase I and the various mutant enzymes were injected into a heparin-POROS column (4.6 × 100 mm; PerSeptive BioSystems, Framingham, MA) connected to a BioCAD system (PerSeptive BioSystems). Proteins were eluted using a linear gradient of 0–1 m NaCl in 10 min (10 mm Tris and 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.0) and monitored at 210 nm. EDTA was added to chelate any calcium ions that may have been present in the buffers. To determine the effect of mutations in CB-1 and CB-2 on the ability of heparinase I to bind calcium, mutants with a dramatic drop in activity were tested for their ability to bind calcium. To accomplish this, we examined the ability of heparinase I and mutants to compete for free calcium with the calcium-chelating fluorescence probe rhod-5N. The fluorescence probe rhod-5N was dissolved and diluted in buffer A (10 mm MOPS and 100 mm KCl, pH 6.5). Buffer A and water used in the study were run through a Chelex resin column to remove trace amounts of calcium. In the absence of calcium, rhod-5N is not fluorescent; however, upon binding calcium, rhod-5N is fluorescent with an emission λmax of 576 nm. Before titration, rhod-5N and heparinase I were added to a quartz cuvette such that the final concentration of rhod-5N in the cuvette was 0.3 μm and that of heparinase I was 3 μm. To this solution was added aliquots of a calcium solution (20 mm) that had been previously equilibrated with 0.3 μm rhod-5N and 3 μmheparinase I. The stock was added such that the calcium concentration in the cuvette was 50, 100, 200, 500, 1000, or 5000 μm. After allowing the solution to come to equilibrium, the sample was scanned from 560 to 600 nm with the excitation wavelength fixed at 561 nm. The plot ofI/I max versus[Ca2+] was fitted to a nonlinear equation to determine the apparent K d (K d′) value. Thus, K d′ values represent the apparent dissociation constants for the fluorescence probe rhod-5N. Control samples without heparinase I were included in the study. In the accompanying study (19Shriver Z. Liu D. Hu Y. Sasisekharan R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4082-4088Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), we identified two putative calcium-binding sites, CB-1 and CB-2. CB-1 spans residues 207–219, and CB-2 includes residues 373–384. Also, as stated earlier, both CB-1 and CB-2 conform to the canonical calcium-binding consensus sequence, the EF-hand motif (16Kretsinger R.H. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1987; 52: 499-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 17Falke J.J. Drake S.K. Hazard A.L. Peersen O.B. Q. Rev. Biophys. 1994; 27: 219-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar) (Table I). This, in part, serves as the basis for the selection of amino acids for site-directed mutagenesis. Specifically, amino acids in CB-1 and CB-2 that contain oxygen side chains and/or that conform to the EF-hand consensus sequence were mutated.Table IAlignment of putative calcium-binding site amino acids in heparinase I with the EF-hand consensus sequenceEF-hand homology135678912XYZG−YI−X−ZaaaAmino acid. sequenceCB 1EKKDKDGKITYVACB-2VTYNLSGYSETARConsensusDXD NXD N SGXI L VS T G D N EXXENNLTSVGDNEThe canonical EF-hand consists of an α-helix, a loop wrapped around the Ca2+ ion, and a second α-helix.

Fig. 1 describes the different mutations in heparinase I generated in this study. In CB-1, D210A, D212A, E207A, G213A, and T216A were first made. To determine whether the combined mutation of calcium-coordinating residues has a more pronounced effect on calcium binding and enzymatic activity, the double mutants D210A/D212A, E207A/D210A, E207A/D212A, D212A/T216A, and G213A/T216A were constructed and expressed. Finally, triple mutants (E207A/D210A/D212A and D212A/G213A/T216A) of all putative calcium-coordinating residues were also generated. In CB-2, the double mutants G378A/Y379A and E381A/T382A were first expressed. If double mutations had an effect on the catalytic activity, the residues were then individually changed to alanines to examine the possibility of one of the residues having a dominant effect on enzymatic activity. Finally, Thr373, Asn375, and Ser377were also individually changed to alanine. Table IIlists the kinetic parameters obtained for wild-type recombinant heparinase I and all mutant enzymes. E207A had no effect on the enzymatic activity, with a K cat of 92 s−1 (Table II). D210A and D212A had a moderate effect on enzymatic activity (K cat = 74 and 65 s−1, respectively). G213A and T216A affected enzymatic activity significantly, with ∼3- and 2-fold decreases ink cat values, respectively, compared with that of wild-type recombinant heparinase I (Table II). Furthermore, the double mutants E207A/D210A and E207A/D212A showed no further reduction in enzymatic activity than the corresponding single mutants D210A and D212A. Similarly, the triple mutant E207A/D210A/D212A was not significantly different from the double mutant D210A/D212A (Table II). This suggests that Glu207 individually or jointly is not essential for enzymatic activity. Since Asp210, Asp212, Gly213, and Thr216individually affected enzymatic activity, we looked at the effect of combined mutations of these amino acids. The double mutations D210A/D212A and G213A/T216A produced a more pronounced reduction in enzymatic activity (an ∼5-fold reduction ink cat values) than any of the individual mutations (Table II). The triple mutant D212A/G213A/T216A also decreased the enzymatic activity ∼5-fold. However, no further reduction in enzymatic activity was observed for the double mutant D212A/T216A as compared with the T216A single mutation.Table IIKinetic constants and salt elution concentrations of wild-type recombinant heparinase I and mutant heparinases IEnzymek catK mK 0.5NaCls −1μmμmmm−L923.9aThe Km value reported here is identical to the one reported by Ernst et al.(4) but differs from the Kmvalue of Godavarti and Sasisekharan (12).

All mutations in CB-1 resulted in increases inK 0.5 values (Table II). Furthermore, there was a strong correlation between loss of enzymatic activity and an increase in K 0.5 (Fig. 2). These results suggest that CB-1 mutants lower the enzymatic activity of heparinase I primarily through lowering its calcium affinity. Moreover, this result is consistent with what is seen upon comparison of the exhaustive heparin digests of recombinant heparinase I and the mutants E207A/D212A, E207A/D210A/D212A, and D212A/G213A/T216A. Mutations in CB-1 did not affect the product profile of heparinase I, but simply slowed the enzyme's catalytic turnover rate (Fig. 3,A–D).Figure 3Anion-exchange HPLC separation of oligosaccharides. Heparin (4 mg/ml) was incubated with −L and mutant heparinases I in 100 mm MOPS and 5 mmcalcium acetate, pH 7.0, for 18 h as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The reaction was then subjected to anion-exchange HPLC using a POROS Q/M column (4.6 × 100 mm; PerSeptive BioSystems) with a salt gradient of 0–2 m NaCl in 10 min and monitored at 232 nm.

For the G378A/Y379A double mutant, the enzymatic activity was reduced significantly (10-fold reduction in k cat). A similar effect was observed for the double mutant E381A/T382A (thek cat was decreased by 9-fold). Since the joint alteration of Gly378 and Tys379 as well as Glu381 and Thr382 affected heparinase I activity drastically, we subsequently investigated the effect of individually altering these residues to alanines to examine whether one mutation had a more pronounced effect than the other on heparinase I activity. When Gly378 and Thr382 were individually changed to alanines, their k catvalues decreased only by about half (Table II). However, the Y379A and E381A single mutations decreased enzymatic activity (k cat) by ∼10-fold, suggesting that these residues are important for calcium binding and/or heparinase I activity. Since Thr373, Asn375, and Ser377 also have oxygen-containing side chains and conform to the EF-hand motif consensus sequence (Table I), we studied the effect of individually changing these amino acids on heparinase I activity. For the T373A and S377A mutants, no significant decrease in enzymatic activity was observed (Table II). The N375A mutation decreased heparinase I activity (k cat) by >9-fold. Unlike the CB-1 mutants, all CB-2 mutants showed decreasedK 0.5 values (Table II). These results were puzzling in light of what was seen for CB-1 and led us to complete additional experiments to understand the role of CB-2 in calcium binding and heparinase I enzymatic activity (see below and “Discussion”). First, we carefully analyzed the exhaustive digest product profiles for the mutants N375A, S377A, G378A/Y379A, and E381A/T382A, the mutants that had a marked effect on activity. The digest profiles were similar to that of −L recombinant heparinase I, but, unlike CB-1 mutants, there was a lower amount of the major products (essentially di- and tetrasaccharides) and a greater fraction of digestion fragments larger than a hexasaccharide (Fig. 4,A–D) (4Ernst S.E.

Studies with deletion mutants and fusion proteins consisting of C/EBPε sequences joined to the Gal4 DNA-binding protein identified two transcriptional activation domains in C/EBPε. Removal of sequences between the two activation domains or sequences between the second activation domain and the C-terminal DNA binding domain significantly increased the activity of C/EBPε, suggesting the presence of two separate regulatory domains (designated RD-1ε and RD-2ε). RD-1ε behaved as a classic active repressor domain being capable of inhibiting adjacent activation domains irrespective of their origin and when linked to a heterologous DNA binding domain.

Four family members, C/EBPα, C/EBPβ, C/EBPδ, and C/EBPε, are expressed in myeloid cells and appear to play different roles in differentiating and mature cells (3Clarke S. Gordon S. J.

Although the primary defects observed in C/EBPε-deficient mice were in the development of the granulocyte lineage, there is evidence that C/EBPε also functions in other hematopoietic cell types. C/EBPε mRNA is present in primary murine macrophages and in multiple immortalized monocytic and macrophage cell lines, and a 34,000 molecular weight C/EBPε polypeptide has been detected in the IC-21 P388D1(IL-1) cell line (12Williams S.C.

Ectopic expression of C/EBPε in a lymphoid cell line activated the expression of a number of genes normally expressed in macrophages, including lipopolysaccharide-regulated cytokine genes and the macrophage-CSFR (M-CSFR) gene (12Williams S.C.

The lack of defects in monocytic development and function in C/EBPε-deficient mice may be due to functional redundancy among C/EBP family members expressed in this cell lineage (7Hu H.-M. Baer M. Williams S.C. Johnson P.F. Schwartz R.C. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 2334-2342PubMed Google Scholar). C/EBPε mRNA was also detected in the human Jurkat T cell line (10Antonson P. Stellan B. Yamanaka R. Xanthopoulos K.G. Genomics. 1996; 35: 30-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), and the expression of some genes normally expressed in T cells, including interleukin-2 and -4, was diminished or abolished in C/EBPε-deficient mice (15Yamanaka R.

The C/EBPε gene contains at least one intron and alternative splice sites and promoters permit the production of multiple polypeptides in humans (14Yamanaka R. Kim G.-D. Radomska H.S.

We have detected a single C/EBPε mRNA in rodent cells that may direct the synthesis of two forms of C/EBPε due to the presence of at least two in frame translation initiation codons (12Williams S.C.

We have carried out a structure/function analysis of the murine C/EBPε polypeptide to identify domains responsible for the transcriptional activity of C/EBPε. We have identified two activation domains in C/EBPε, one at the N terminus and a second close to the center of the protein. In addition, two regions within the C/EBPε polypeptide act as repressor domains and are likely to be sites of protein-protein interactions that modulate the activity of C/EBPε. The murine C/EBPε mRNA contains two in frame initiation codons separated by 96 base pairs (12Williams S.C. Du Y. Schwartz R.C. Weiler S.R. Ortiz M. Keller J.R. Johnson P.F. J. Biol.

PCR was used to introduce NcoI sites at the first of these two sites and a HindIII site following the termination codon, and the resultant cDNA was inserted into the pMEX eukaryotic expression vector (9Williams S.C. Cantwell C.A. Johnson P.F. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 1553-1567Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar). N-terminal and internal deletion constructs were prepared by PCR in a manner similar to that previously described for C/EBPβ (18Williams S.C. Baer M. Dillner A.J. Johnson P.F. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3170-3183Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Briefly, PCR was used to introduce either BglII orBamHI restriction sites at specific positions within the C/EBPε coding sequence, and the resultant fragments were combined to generate the required recombinant. The sequences of the oligonucleotides used in this study are shown in Table I.

Gal4 fusion genes were constructed in the Gal0 plasmid, which is similar to pSG424 (19Sadowski I. Ptashne M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 7539Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar). This plasmid encodes amino acids 1–147 of the yeast Gal4 transcriptional activator located downstream of the SV40 early promoter. All C/EBPε- and VP16-derived segments were inserted downstream of the Gal4 sequences as NcoI/ClaI fragments as described previously (18Williams S.C. Baer M. Dillner A.J. Johnson P.F. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3170-3183Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). The VP16 activation domain fragment used here encodes amino acids 429–456 (20Cress W.D. Triezenberg S.J. Science. 1991; 251: 87-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). Gal4 C/EBPα-(1–108), Gal4 C/EBPβ-(1–83), and Gal4 C/EBPε-(33–64) (previously named Gal4 CRP1–1-32)) encode the indicated amino acids from each C/EBP protein and have been described previously (18Williams S.C. Baer M. Dillner A.J. Johnson P.F. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3170-3183Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). The C/EBP-dependent (DEI)4-35AlbLUC (which consists of four copies of the DEI element from the serum albumin gene linked to the minimal promoter region of the same gene) and Gal4-dependent G5E1bLUC (which consists of five copies of a Gal4-binding site upstream of the E1b minimal promoter) luciferase reporter plasmids were described previously (18Williams S.C. Baer M. Dillner A.J. Johnson P.F. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3170-3183Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). The human HepG2 hepatocarcinoma and monkey COS-1 kidney cell lines were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Mediatech, Herndon, VI) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (HyClone, Logan, UT). HepG2 cells were transfected at approximately 30–40% confluency in 3.5-cm dishes using a standard calcium phosphate co-precipitation method (18Williams S.C. Baer M. Dillner A.J. Johnson P.F. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3170-3183Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). In a typical experiment 2 μg of reporter and 2.5–5 μg of effector plasmid of pMEX-based constructs or 2 μg of reporter and 0.6 μg of effector plasmid for Gal4-based constructs were used. DNA concentrations were equalized using pBluescript (Stratagene). Although HepG2 cells do not express their endogenous C/EBPε gene, we have obtained similar transactivation results in multiple cell lines, including some that do express C/EBPε. 2N. D. Angerer and S. C. Williams, unpublished results. Consequently, HepG2 cells were used in these studies as they are relatively easy to transfect and yield consistent results. However, we were unable to detect Gal4 proteins in transfected HepG2 cells and used COS-1 cells instead for this purpose. COS-1 cells were transfected by electroporation as described. 3A. J. Reinhart, S. C. Williams, B. J. Clark, and D. M. Stocco, submitted for publication. Statistical analyses were carried out using a two-tailed Student's ttest, and results that were statistically significant at 95% or 99% confidence levels are indicated in the figures. Luciferase assays were carried out as described (12Williams S.C. Du Y. Schwartz R.C. Weiler S.R. Ortiz M. Keller J.R. Johnson P.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13493-13501Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Point mutations were introduced into the C/EBPε coding sequence using the Gene Editor kit (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Mutagenic oligonucleotides were synthesized carrying 15 base pairs on either side of the mutation site, and a restriction site was generally included to aid in analysis. In all mutagenic reactions the target residue was changed to an alanine, and introduction of mutations was verified by sequencing. The names and sequence of oligonucleotides utilized were as follows (base changes are indicated in lowercase): A82/4 changes Pro82, Ala83, and Asp84 to (Ala)3, 5′-AAATGGCCGAGGcgCtGCaGcCAGGTAGTGAGG-3′; A121/3 changes Lys121, Glu122, and Glu123 to (Ala)3, 5′-GCTGTGGCGGTGgctGcaGcGCCTCGAGGGCCA-3′; A121/2 changes Glu122 and Glu123 to (Ala)2, 5′-GTGGCGGTGAAGGccGcGCCTCGAGGGCCA-3′; and Ala123 changes Glu123 to Ala, 5′-GCGGTGAAGGAGGcGCCTCGAGGGCCA-3′. The A121/2 mutation which changes Lys121 and Glu122to (Ala)2 was generated by repairing the third mutated position in A121/3 by PCR using the Glu128 oligonucleotide shown in Table I. For transfected HepG2 cells we found that most nuclear proteins were present in the pellet after centrifugation of the extracts prepared for luciferase reactions. These were dissolved in Laemmli sample buffer, and equivalent aliquots of each reaction were separated by 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (Micron Separations, Westborough, MA). Nuclear extracts were prepared from COS-1 cells as described previously (8Bretz J.D. Williams S.C. Baer M. Johnson P.F. Schwartz R.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 7306-7310Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Immune detection was carried out as described previously (22Nalbant D. Williams S.C. Stocco D.M. Khan S.A. Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 272-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) using either a C/EBPε-specific rabbit polyclonal antiserum (C-22, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) or a mouse monoclonal antiserum directed against the DNA binding domain of Gal4 (RK5C1, Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Immune complexes were detected using the Supersignal chemiluminescence detection kit (Pierce). To identify functional domains that mediate transcriptional activation by C/EBPε, we compared the ability of wild type C/EBPε and two proteins lacking N-terminal segments to activate the (DEI)4-35AlbLUC reporter construct in HepG2 human hepatocarcinoma cells (Fig.1 A). This construct was activated 45-fold by full-length C/EBPε; however, deletion of either 96 or 139 N-terminal amino acids decreased transcriptional activity to background levels. Thus, C/EBPε is capable of functioning as a potent transcriptional activator, and the N-terminal portion of C/EBPε contains most or all of the activation sequences. The N-terminal sequences of C/EBPε, C/EBPα, C/EBPβ, and C/EBPδ possess three segments of significant sequence similarity that correspond to three activation domain modules (ADM) first identified in C/EBPβ (18Williams S.C. Baer M. Dillner A.J. Johnson P.F. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3170-3183Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar) (Fig.1 B). We previously demonstrated that amino acids 33–64 of C/EBPε (which contain ADM2 and -3) functions as a relatively weak activation domain when fused to the DNA binding domain of the yeast transcriptional activator protein Gal4 (18Williams S.C. Baer M. Dillner A.J. Johnson P.F. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3170-3183Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Therefore, we tested whether inclusion of the first 32 amino acids of C/EBPε, which contain sequences similar to the ADM1 domain of C/EBPβ, would increase the potency of the N-terminal C/EBPε activation domain (ADI). The addition of amino acids 1–32 resulted in a slight but significant (p < 0.01) increase in C/EBPε AD activity (compare Gal4 ε-(33–64) to Gal4 ε-(1–64)), indicating that the ADM1 region is likely to be a functional component of ADI of C/EBPε (Fig. 1 C). In comparison, the equivalent regions of the C/EBPα (amino acids 1–108) and C/EBPβ-(1–83) proteins were 4.5- and 7.5-fold, respectively, more powerful in this assay. The C/EBPε polypeptide also shares a second region of homology (amino acids 140–162) with C/EBPα and C/EBPδ which includes sequences identified as a second activation domain in C/EBPα (23Friedman A.D. McKnight S.L. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 1416-1426Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 24Pei D.Q. Shih C.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 1480-1487Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 25Nerlov C. Ziff E.B. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 350-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). This region of C/EBPε functioned as a weak activation domain (referred to as ADII) when fused to the Gal4 DBD (Fig. 1 C). We next tested whether the C/EBPε polypeptide contains additional sequences outside the activation domains that modulate its transcriptional activity. C/EBPε proteins lacking internal sequences were tested for their ability to activate (DEI)4-35AlbLUC in HepG2 cells (Fig. 2 A). The removal of amino acids 65–194 (i.e. all sequences between ADI and the DBD) resulted in a highly significant (p < 0.01) 6-fold stimulation of transcriptional activity (compare 1–281 and 1–281 (Δ65–194)). Proteins lacking sequences between ADI and ADII (1–281(Δ65–96) and 1–281(Δ65–139), Fig.2 A) were also more active than the wild type C/EBPε protein in this assay, approximately 4- and 7-fold, respectively, identifying a region between amino acids 65 and 140 (termed regulatory domain-1ε or RD-1ε) that negatively regulates C/EBPε activity. Removal of amino acids between ADII and the DBD did not significantly affect C/EBPε activity (1–281(Δ163–194) Fig.2 A), but combining the deletion of amino acids 163–194 with the deletion of the RD-1ε region resulted in further stimulation of C/EBPε activity. For example, a protein lacking amino acids 65–139 and 163–194 displayed approximately 1.5-fold greater activity than a protein lacking amino acids 65–139 alone (Fig. 2 A), and similar results were observed with other constructs lacking sequences in both regions (data not shown). We conclude that a second negatively acting domain, named RD-2ε, is located between amino acids 163 and 194 which in this context appears to function in combination with RD-1ε. Similar steady-state levels of each recombinant protein were detected by Western analysis (Fig. 2 B) indicating that the observed effects were not simply due to differences in protein expression levels or stability. To test whether C/EBPε regulatory domains could function when attached to a heterologous DNA binding domain, we constructed a series of Gal4-C/EBPε chimeric genes and tested their ability to activate expression from the Gal4-dependent G5E1bLUC reporter plasmid in HepG2 cells. Fusion proteins bearing the first 64, 98, or 116 amino acids of C/EBPε all functioned as strong transcriptional activators (Fig.3 A). However, a significant 34-fold decrease (compared with Gal4 ε-(1–64)) in activity was observed when C/EBPε sequences were extended to amino acid 128, indicating that RD-1ε is located N-terminal to this amino acid. A 5-fold increase in activity was observed upon inclusion of sequences up to amino acid 162, presumably due to the inclusion of ADII, and a further decrease (3.3-fold) occurred when the C/EBPε sequences were extended to amino acid 193 to include the RD-2ε-containing region. Finally, we tested whether RD-2ε is capable of functioning in the absence of RD-1ε by fusing amino acids 162–193 directly to ADI. The addition of this region resulted in a 4-fold decrease in activity (compare Gal4 ε-(1–64) to Gal4 ε-(1–64)(162–193) indicating that RD-2ε is capable of repressing ADI function in a position- and RD-1ε-independent fashion in Gal4 fusions. Unfortunately, we were unable to detect expression of Gal4 fusion proteins in nuclear extracts of HepG2 cells; however, they were detectable after transient transfection of COS-1 cells. All Gal4 fusions behaved similarly in transactivation assays in COS-1 cells2 and were expressed at similar levels (Fig. 3 B) again indicating that the observed functional differences are not due to variations in protein levels. To study the activation domain specificity of the two regulatory domains in C/EBPε, we tested their ability to repress the activity of Gal4 fusion proteins containing the potent activation domain from the herpes simplex virus VP16 protein (Fig.4 A). Initially we tested whether C/EBPε sequences could repress transactivation when placed downstream of the VP16AD, i.e. in a similar position relative to the activation domain as in C/EBPε. The activity of the Gal4VP16 protein on the G5E1bLUC reporter plasmid in HepG2 cells was set at 100%, and the activity of each fusion protein was calculated relative to this value. The inclusion of amino acids 64–98 or 64–116 did not diminish the activity of the VP16AD. However, a protein containing amino acids 64–128 displayed only 16% of the activity of the control, indicating that RD-1ε is capable of repressing the activity of the VP16AD. To map the N-terminal boundary of RD-1ε, three additional constructs containing C/EBPε sequences initiating at amino acid 97 were tested. Fusion proteins carrying amino acids 97–162 or 97–193 were 55 and 66% as active as Gal4VP16AD; however, the attachment of amino acids 97–128 repressed VP16AD activity to 4% of control levels. These data further refine the position of RD-1ε between amino acids 97 and 128, and the higher activity of constructs containing amino acids 97–162 and 97–193 is likely due to the presence of ADII. In the final construct in this series, RD-2ε (amino acids 162–193) was attached to the C terminus of the VP16AD. This protein displayed only 27% (p < 0.01) of the activity of the control protein, indicating that RD-2ε was also capable of inhibiting a heterologous AD. Western blotting confirmed that all proteins were expressed at comparable levels (Fig.4 B, for example). A second series of chimeric genes was constructed in which the order of the C/EBPε and VP16 sequences was reversed to test for position-dependent effects. Although some differences in the repressive activity of the C/EBPε regulatory domains were observed in the two sets of proteins, the overall pattern of activity was similar (Fig. 4 A). The minimal RD-1ε and RD-2ε segments (amino acids 97–128 and 162–193, respectively) both repressed VP-16AD function, albeit to a slightly lesser but statistically significant (p < 0.01) extent than in the previous set of chimeras. In this second arrangement, RD-2ε appeared to be an efficient repressor module even in the presence of ADII of C/EBPε (compare Gal4 ε-(97–162)-V to Gal4 ε-(97–193)-V)), which could potentially be explained by its close proximity to the VP16AD in these proteins. We next compared the sequence of amino acids 64–128 of C/EBPε to the sequence of repressor domains identified in other transcription factors. We identified two small conserved motifs (termed conserved motif (CM) 1 and 2 in Fig.5) in a subset of factors examined. CM1 is located between amino acids 82 and 86 of C/EBPε and is conserved in C/EBPε, rat and human C/EBPβ, and Sp3 but is absent in chicken C/EBPβ, c-Fos, and FosB. A consensus sequence was derived for CM1 as Pro-Ala-Asp-X-B, where X is any amino acid andB is a basic amino acid. CM1 lies outside the region defined as RD-1ε and would not be predicted to be critical for RD-1ε function. CM2 is located between amino acids 121 and 128 of C/EBPε (i.e. within RD-1ε), and related sequences were present in all proteins listed. CM2 has the consensus sequence B-Glu-Glu-X-X-X-Pro-Glu and is most highly conserved in C/EBPε, C/EBPβ (human and chicken), Sp3, and FosB. We next tested whether mutating residues in CM1 and/or CM2 would diminish RD-1ε function. The mutations focused on the conserved PAD and KEE motifs in CM1 and CM2, respectively (Fig. 5). Both motifs were replaced with alanines in one or both of the Gal4 ε-(1–128) and Gal4 ε-(64–128)-V fusion proteins (see Figs. 3 and 4). Mutation of the CM1 sequence had no effect on the activity of Gal4 ε-(1–128) as proteins thus configured displayed repressed activities similar to the wild type protein (A82/4 mutant in Fig.6 A). However, mutating CM2 to three alanine residues (A121/3 mutants) resulted in significant increases in the activity of both proteins, 12-fold in Gal4 ε-(1–128) and 29-fold in Gal4 ε-(64–128)-V (Fig. 6, Aand B). Mutating pairs of amino acids (A121/2 and A122/3) or the terminal glutamic acid residue alone (A123) all significantly reduced the activity of the regulatory domain in Gal4 ε-(1–128) and, where tested, Gal4 ε-(64–128)-V indicating that residues 121 and 123 within CM2 are critical for RD-1ε function. The contribution of the glutamic acid at position 122 remains to be verified. Equivalent levels of each protein were detected by Western blotting (Fig. 6, Cand D). Finally, we tested whether co-expression of RD-1ε might result in derepression of a Gal4-C/EBPε fusion protein by competing for binding of a nuclear protein. Increasing amounts of the C/EBPε-(97–281) expression vector were co-transfected with Gal4 ε-(1–128) into HepG2 cells, and luciferase activities were measured (Fig. 7). At the highest level of C/EBPε-(97–281) expression vector the activity of Gal4 ε-(1–128) was 3-fold higher than in the absence of any competitor molecule. To test whether this effect was attributable to the co-expression of a molecule containing a functional RD-1ε element, a second series of transfections were carried out using a competitor molecule carrying the A121/3 mutation, which changes the KEE motif to three alanine residues and abolishes RD-1ε activity (see Fig. 6, A andB). In this case relief of inhibition was not observed, in fact luciferase activities decreased as the amount of competitor was increased which we interpret to be the result of competition between the promoters in the two expression vectors. Both proteins were efficiently synthesized as measured by Western analysis (Fig.7 B). Taken together, the results of these assays indicate that a co-expressed RD-1ε-containing protein is able to relieve inhibition in Gal4 ε-(1–128) presumably by competing for a cellular protein that normally binds to RD-1ε and mediates the repressive effect of this domain. The individual members of the C/EBP family possess a highly conserved bZIP DNA binding domain and are consequently capable of binding to identical recognition sequences in the control regions of target genes (9Williams S.C. Cantwell C.A. Johnson P.F. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 1553-1567Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar, 26Cao Z. Umek R.M. McKnight S.L. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 1538-1552Crossref PubMed Scopus (1350) Google Scholar). Therefore, the unique functions of each protein are likely to be controlled by domains outside the DNA contacting basic region, and numerous structure/function studies have been carried out to identify these domains. In the case of C/EBPε, we have previously identified domains that control DNA binding, dimerization (9Williams S.C. Cantwell C.A. Johnson P.F. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 1553-1567Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar), nuclear localization (27Williams S.C. Angerer N.D. Johnson P.F. Gene Expr. 1997; 6: 371-385PubMed Google Scholar), and transcriptional activation (12Williams S.C. Du Y. Schwartz R.C. Weiler S.R. Ortiz M. Keller J.R. Johnson P.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13493-13501Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). To understand more clearly the activity of C/EBPε is regulated we have now identified additional domains that control the activity of C/EBPε. In addition to defining sequences that function as transcriptional activation domains, we also identified two separate regulatory domains, RD-1ε and RD-2ε, that repress C/EBPε activity. RD-1ε is located between the two transcriptional activation domains and is wholly contained in the region spanning amino acids 97–128. RD-2ε is located N-terminal to the DNA binding domain, and its activity in the context of C/EBPε was only evident when RD-1ε was also absent. However, RD-2ε was capable of independently inhibiting a linked activation domain in Gal4 fusion proteins. Over the past several years, numerous nuclear proteins have been identified that contain domains that negatively regulate transcription (reviewed in Ref. 28Cowell I.G. Trends Biol. Sci. 1994; 19: 38-42Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Two criteria have been used to define these domains as active repressor domains as follows: the ability to function in a modular fashion when attached to a heterologous DNA binding domain, and second to act as the site for interactions with corepressor proteins (29Fisher A.L. Caudy M. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1931-1940Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). By these criteria, RD-1ε behaves as an active repression domain as it inhibited the activity of C/EBPε and VP16 activation domains when attached to the Gal4 DBD. In addition, our competition data indicate that RD-1ε is a site for protein-protein interactions. RD-2ε was also capable of inhibiting a linked activation domain when attached to a heterologous DNA binding domain thereby satisfying one criterion for characterization as an active repression domain. Specific motifs within repressor domains, often comprised of just a few amino acids, have been identified that are critical for repressor domain function. For example, the repressor domains of theDrosophila proteins Hairy and Enhancer of Split contain the four amino acid motif, Trp-Arg-Pro-Trp (WRPW), which mediates interactions with members of the Groucho family of corepressors (30Fisher A.L. Ohsako S. Caudy M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2670-2677Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). Our mutation studies identified the sequence Lys-Glu-Glu (KEE) in RD-1ε as being required for repressor domain function and for protein-protein interactions. This same motif is required for activity of the repressor domain of Sp3 (31Dennig J. Beato M. Suske G. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5659-5667Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar), and similar sequences are present in RD-1 of C/EBPβ (18Williams S.C. Baer M. Dillner A.J. Johnson P.F. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3170-3183Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar) and the inhibitory domain (ID-1) of c-Fos and FosB (32Brown H.J. Sutherland J.A. Cook A. Bannister A.J. Kouzarides T. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 124-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The corresponding amino acids have not been mutated in C/EBPβ, c-Fos, or FosB; however, the repressor domain of c-Fos has been shown to be a site for protein-protein interactions (32Brown H.J. Sutherland J.A. Cook A. Bannister A.J. Kouzarides T. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 124-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Therefore, KEE or a similar motif may be a signature for repressor domains from proteins derived from diverse transcription factor families. The KEE motif is not present in RD-2ε; however, as shown in Fig. 8, RD-2ε contains multiple copies of the consensus minimal recognition sequence for members of the MAP kinase family, the dipeptide (Ser/Thr)-Pro (33Karin M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16483-16486Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2258) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is conceivable that phosphorylation of the RD-2ε element by a member of the MAP kinase family might regulate the activity of C/EBPε. Little is currently known concerning the phosphorylation of C/EBPε; however, support for this hypothesis comes from studies of other C/EBP family members, particularly C/EBPβ. Comparison of this region of RD-2ε to the corresponding regions of C/EBPα, C/EBPβ, and C/EBPδ (i.e. the region immediately N-terminal to the basic region) reveals multiple putative MAP kinase sites in each protein (Fig. 8). Phosphorylation of the threonine residue at position 238 of human C/EBPβ (amino acid 168 of rat C/EBPβ) via a Ras-dependent MAP kinase pathway in NIH3T3 and P19 cells has been shown to stimulate C/EBPβ activity (34Nakajima T. Kinoshita S. Sasagawa T. Sasaki K. Naruto M. Kishimoto T. Akira S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 2207-2211Crossref PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar). In addition, mutation of this residue to a non-phosphorylatable residue decreased C/EBPβ activity in P19 and neuronal cell lines (34Nakajima T. Kinoshita S. Sasagawa T. Sasaki K. Naruto M. Kishimoto T. Akira S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 2207-2211Crossref PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar, 35Sterneck E. Johnson P.F. J. Neurochem. 1998; 70: 2424-2433Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Mutagenesis studies should begin to define the importance of this region for RD-2ε and C/EBPε activity. Two previous studies proposed that the activity of C/EBPβ was inhibited by intermolecular interactions between the repressor and activation domains, which served to block access of the activation domain to its target proteins (18Williams S.C. Baer M. Dillner A.J. Johnson P.F. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3170-3183Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar, 36Kowenz-Leutz E. Twamley G. Ansieau S. Leutz A. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 2781-2791Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). However, the data presented here suggest that the RD-1ε, and probably the RD-2ε, repressor domains of C/EBPε act as sites for interactions with accessory proteins that act as corepressors. Multiple proteins have been identified that physically interact with members of the C/EBP family, although most of these proteins interact via the bZIP domain. These proteins are generally transcriptional activators that bind to adjacent sites on promoters and synergize with C/EBP proteins in activating transcription of the target gene and include NFκB (37Stein B.

Biol. 1997; 17: 2038-2047Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, a limited number of proteins have been identified that interact with regions outside the DNA binding domain of C/EBP proteins, including Sp1 (43Lee Y.H. Williams S.C. Baer M. Sterneck E. Gonzalez F.J. Johnson P.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2038-2047Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and the retinoblastoma protein (44Chen P.L. Riley D.J. Chen Y.M. Lee W.H. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2794-2804Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar,45Chen P.-L. Riley D.J. Chen-Kiang S. Lee W.-H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 465-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar); however, it is unlikely that any of these proteins interact with RD-1ε. The identification of the KEE motif as a critical component of RD-1ε should facilitate the identification of its cognate binding proteins and provide clues as to its function in C/EBPε. Two alternative scenarios might explain the role of these repressor domains in determining the biological function of C/EBPε. First, interaction of corepressors with the repressor domains may serve to maintain C/EBPε in an inactive state until an activating signal is received. This model would explain the ability of C/EBPε to participate in the inducible activation of cytokine genes upon lipopolysaccharide stimulation of macrophages and other cell types (12Williams S.C.

Further studies will determine whether phosphorylation of potential MAP kinase sites in RD-2ε are involved in regulating C/EBPε activity. Alternatively, it is becoming apparent that transcriptional repression may be just as important as activation in regulating cell-specific gene expression during development. Therefore, C/EBPε could play dual regulatory roles as a transcriptional activator and repressor, depending on its association with corepressors or coactivators. This model would explain the apparent ability of C/EBPε to both positively and negatively regulate expression of the M-CSFR gene (12Williams S.C. Du Y. Schwartz R.C. Weiler S.R. Ortiz M. Keller J.R.

Detailed characterization of the exact functions of each domain in C/EBPε, and their interacting partners, along with analysis of cellular distributions of putative corepressor molecules should aid in determining the activity and specific functions of C/EBPε.

Mice with a knockout mutation of the TGF-β3 gene die a few hours after birth. A full-thickness skin grafting approach was used to investigate the postnatal development and homeostatic control of the skin of these mice. Grafted skin of mice with a disruption of the TGF-β3 gene developed similarly to grafts of wild type and TGF-β1 knockout animals. However, a strikingly different response was observed after acute treatment with the tumor promoter 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA). When exposed to TPA, the grafted skin of wild type and TGF-β1 knockout mice underwent a hyperplastic response similar to that of normal mouse skin. In marked contrast, TPA treatment of TGF-β3 knockout grafts induced widespread areas of keratinocyte cell death. Analysis of cultured keratinocytes treated with purified TGF-β isoforms revealed that TGF-β3 plays a direct and specific function in protecting keratinocytes against TPA-induced cell death. The protective function of TGF-β3 on TPA-induced cell death was not because of general suppression of the signaling pathways triggered by this agent, as ERK1/2 activation occurred to a similar if not greater extent in TGF-β3-treatedversus control keratinocytes. Instead, TGF-β3 treatment led to a significant reduction in TPA-induced c-Jun N-terminal kinase activity, which was associated and possibly explained by specific counteracting effects of TGF-β3 on TPA-induced disruption of keratinocyte focal adhesions.

Homeostasis of self renewing epithelia such as the epidermis is determined by a complex interplay of signals, resulting from cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions as well as diffusible factors acting on cells of either the same or different type. The TGF-β family of diffusible factors is thought to play a key role in control of epithelial homeostasis. Some well known functions of TGF-βs in epithelial tissues include growth inhibition, promotion of cell adhesion and tissue reorganization, suppression and, at later stages, promotion of tumor development (1Hoodless P.A. Wrana J.L. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1998; 228: 235-272Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Three TGF-β isoforms exist that share a high degree of homology (∼80%) in their processed active regions. All three isoforms bind to the same cellular receptors, although with different affinities, and elicit similar biological responses on most cultured cells. However, expression of the three TGF-βs is differentially regulated in vivo in different cell types and at various developmental stages, suggesting that the three isoforms play distinct biological roles (2Roberts A.B. Kim S.J. Noma T. Glick A.B. Lafyatis R. Lechleider R. Jakowlew S.B. Geiser A. OqReilly M.A. Danielpour D. CIBA Found. Symp. 1991; 157: 7-28PubMed Google Scholar). This conclusion is consistent with the fact that mice with disruptions of each of the three TGF-β genes have little or no overlapping phenotype. TGF-β1 knockout mice die a few weeks after birth of a wasting syndrome accompanied by a multifocal inflammatory reaction (3Shull M.M. Ormsby I. Kier A.B. Pawlowski S. Diebold R.J. Yin M. Allen R.

In the skin, elevated TGF-β1 expression has been found in keratinocytes of the basal epidermal layer and in cultured keratinocytes under basal proliferating conditions, suggesting that this factor is involved in a negative feedback growth regulatory loop (8Fowlis D.J.

Expression of TGF-β3 mRNA is limited, at least in culture, to cells of mesenchymal origin, including dermal fibroblasts, whereas it is not found in keratinocytes (11Derynck R. Lindquist P.B. Lee A.

Skin homeostasis results from a delicate balance between keratinocyte growth, differentiation, and apoptosis.

In vivo, acute treatment with TPA leads to epidermal hyperplasia, possibly through mechanisms such as blockage of gap-junctional intercellular communication (15Budunova I.V. Carbajal S. Slaga T.J. Mol. Carcinog. 1996; 15: 202-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) and/or differential modulation of specific TGF-β isoforms (9Escherick J.S. DiCunto F. Flanders K.C. Missero C. Dotto G.P. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 5517-5522PubMed Google Scholar, 16Akhurst R.J. Fee F. Balmain A. Nature. 1988; 331: 363-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). In vitro, acute TPA treatment has the opposite effect of inducing keratinocyte detachment, growth arrest, and differentiation (Ref. 17Brissette J.L. Li J. Kamimura J. Lee D. Dotto G.P. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2212-2221Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar and references therein). The discrepancy between the in vivo and in vitro effects has never been explained. The present study was undertaken to establish the role that individual TGF-βs, and in particular TGF-β3, play in control of epidermal homeostasis. As mentioned, mice with a disruption of the TGF-β3 gene die a few hours after birth (5Kaartinen V. Voncken J.W. Shuler C. Warburton D. Bu D. Heisterkamp N. Groffen J. Nat. Genet. 1995; 11: 415-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (880) Google Scholar, 6Proetzel G. Pawlowski S.A. Wiles M.V. Yin M. Boivin G.P. Howles P.N. Ding J. Ferguson M.W. Doetschman T. Nat. Genet. 1995; 11: 409-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (769) Google Scholar). A full-thickness skin grafting approach was used to investigate the postnatal development and homeostatic control of the skin of these mice, in comparison with similarly grafted skin from wild type and TGF-β1 knockout animals. These studies suggest that TGF-β3 may not be essential for normal skin maturation. Instead, the in vivo findings, together with analysis of cultured keratinocytes treated with purified TGF-β isoforms, indicate that TGF-β3 plays a specific and direct function in protecting keratinocytes against the death-inducing effects of agents such as TPA. Homozygous TGF-β3 knockout mice die at birth and can be rapidly cannibalized by the mothers. For this reason, experiments were synchronized so as to have sufficient numbers of time-mated heterozygous pregnant females to use as source of pups immediately before delivery (18.5 days of pregnancy). The genotype of pups was determined by polymerase chain reaction analysis of tail DNA with oligonucleotide primers specific for the wild-type and disrupted TGF-β alleles (6Proetzel G. Pawlowski S.A. Wiles M.V. Yin M. Boivin G.P. Howles P.N. Ding J. Ferguson M.W. Doetschman T. Nat. Genet. 1995; 11: 409-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (769) Google Scholar). Skins from wild type and homozygous knockout littermates were used for full-thickness grafting onto nude mice. The procedure involved a 10 × 10-mm excision of the host skin, up to but not including the panniculus carnosus and placement of a similar size fragment of newborn mouse skin onto the area of excision. The grafted skin was covered with a Vaseline gauze and a silicon transplantation chamber on top for protection. Gauze and chamber were removed 6 days after grafting. Grafts were analyzed at 1 month after grafting, under basal conditions and after treatment with TPA (10−4m in acetone, Sigma) or acetone vehicle alone. In each case, the grafted tissue was excised, half was frozen, and the other half was fixed in 10% neutral-buffered formalin before histological and immunohistochemical analysis. Terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated dUTP biotin nick end-labeling (TUNEL) assays of frozen sections were performed as described below for cultured cells. Immunohistochemistry for TGF-β3 expression was performed by incubating frozen sections of wild type and knockout grafted skins with antibodies against TGF-β3 (Santa Cruz) in the presence or the absence of a specific neutralizing peptide followed by incubation with biotinylated anti-rabbit secondary antibodies (Vector, Burlingame). Fast RED (Sigma) was used as substrate for the alkaline phosphatase reaction. Primary keratinocytes were prepared from wild type newborn mice (SENCAR) and grown at 34 °C and 8% CO2 in medium at low calcium concentrations as described previously (18Calautti E. Missero C. Stein P.L. Ezzell R.M. Dotto G.P. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 2279-2291Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Confluent cultures were tested 5 days after plating. Cells were either untreated or treated with the TGF-β1 or TGF-β3 isoforms (R&D Systems) at 3 ng/ml for the indicated amounts of time followed by exposure to TPA (in Me2SO stock solutions; 100 ng/ml final concentration) or Me2SO vehicle alone. Cell viability was determined by the calcein-AM/propidium iodide staining method (19Yu J.S. Sena-Esteves M. Paulus W. Breakefield X.O. Reeves S.A. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 5423-5427PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, culture medium was replaced with 1 μm calcein-AM (Molecular Probes) and 5 μg/ml propidium iodide in serum-free low calcium medium for 20 min at 34 °C. Cultures were examined immediately without fixation using a Zeiss Axiophot fluorescence microscope. Green and red fluorescence were simultaneously recorded using a computer-digitalized equipment. In each case, 4–5 different fields were examined, and a minimum of 800 cells were counted to determine the fraction of calcein-AM (green) versus propidium iodide (red) positive cells. Primary keratinocytes that were either untreated or treated with specific TGF-β isoforms and/or TPA were trypsinized, centrifuged, and brought into suspension into serum-supplemented medium, counted, and recentrifuged in a cytospin apparatus onto gelatin-coated glass slides. In other experiments, cells were directly grown on tissue culture slides (Labtec) and treated under these conditions. Cytospin preparations or keratinocytes directly grown on slides were fixed in 10% neutral-buffered formalin for 10 h at room temperature, air dried for 1 h, and then permeabilized with 20 μg/ml proteinase K for 5–10 h at room temperature. The terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated dUTP biotin nick end-labeling assay (TUNEL) was performed using the TACS terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase in situ apoptosis detection kit (Trevigen) using 3,3′-diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride or TUNEL blue labeling for detection according to the manufacturer's instructions. Mouse primary keratinocytes were plated onto collagen-coated glass coverslips and grown to confluence. Cells that were either untreated or treated with TGF-β1, TGF-β3, and/or TPA were fixed for 10 h at room temperature with 2% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline followed by permeabilization with 0.1% Triton X-100 in phosphate-buffered saline and blocking in 5% goat serum in phosphate-buffered saline. Cells were incubated with anti-vinculin rabbit antiserum (Sigma) for 1 h at room temperature, followed by incubation with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated secondary antibodies (Southern Biotech. Associates) and BODIPY(581–591)-conjugated phalloidin (Molecular Probes). Samples were analyzed by confocal microscopy using a LEICA TCS 4D scanner connected to an inverted LEITZ DM IRB microscope. Images were processed using a TCS-NT software package. Primary keratinocytes in low calcium medium were either untreated or treated with TGFβ1 or TGFβ3 (3 ng/ml) for 18 h followed by exposure to TPA (100 ng/ml) for different lengths of time. In vitro kinase assays were performed using the stress-activated protein kinase/c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) or p44/42 mitogen-activated protein kinase assay kits (New England BioLabs Inc.), according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, cells were lysed in cell lysis buffer and normalized for protein amounts by the Bradford assay (Bio-Rad). Same amounts of total cell extracts (250 μg of proteins) were incubated with c-Jun (1–89) fusion protein beads to immunoprecipitate the Jun N-terminal kinase or with phospho-specific antibody to p44/42 mitogen-activated protein kinase to selectively immunoprecipitate active mitogen-activated protein kinase (ERK1/2). Kinase reactions were carried out in the presence of cold ATP using either recombinant c-Jun or Elk1 proteins as substrates for the JNK and ERK1/2 kinases, respectively. Samples were analyzed by 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and immunoblotting with either phospho-specific c-Jun antibodies to detect c-Jun phosphorylated at Ser-63 or phospho-specific Elk1 antibodies to detect the phosphorylated form of Elk1 at Ser-383. For JNK and ERK1/2 protein level determinations, total cell extracts were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and immunoblotting with rabbit polyclonal antibodies against JNK and ERK1/2, respectively (Santa Cruz Biotech., Inc.). In all cases, blots were developed with the ECL system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and results were quantified by densitometric scanning. The neonatal mortality of TGF-β3-deficient mice prevents a direct assessment of how this mutation can affect the maturation and homeostasis of skin after birth. To overcome this problem, we used a full-thickness grafting approach of newborn mouse skin onto nude mice in such a way that it was possible to compare the effects of the TGF-β3 and -β1 mutations under identical experimental settings and for a prolonged period of time. Newborn mouse skin grafted in this manner develops normally as if in the intact animal, with good hair growth becoming detectable by 9–10 days after grafting and complete fur formation by 18–20 days. Within a similar time frame, the multiple epidermal layers characteristic of newborn skin are reduced to the two to three layers of the adult animal. The grafts can be maintained up to 1 year with normal hair production. The lack of the TGF-β3 isoform did not lead to gross alterations in skin maturation and hair formation. Compared with control grafts, the grafted skin of mice with specific TGF-β3 or -β1 knockout mutations showed good hair growth by 2–3 weeks after grafting (Fig.1 and data not shown). Within a similar time frame, the stratified multiple squamous epidermal layers characteristic of normal newborn mouse skin were reduced to 2–3 layers of the adult mouse epidermis with normal structure and morphology. Immunohistochemical analysis with antibodies against TGF-β3 produced a significantly lower level of positive staining in the grafts of TGF-β3 knockout skin relative to surrounding skin and/or grafts of wild type animals (Fig. 1, lower panels). However, even in the TGF-β3 knockout grafts, residual specific staining for TGF-β3 was detectable, especially at the periphery, consistent with some diffusion of this factor from the neighboring skin. Previous analysis of knockout mice for other potentially redundant genes has indicated that essential functions of these genes can be unmasked under conditions of stress, where normal homeostatic mechanisms are perturbed or partially abrogated (18Calautti E. Missero C. Stein P.L. Ezzell R.M. Dotto G.P. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 2279-2291Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 20Missero C. Di Cunto F. Kiyokawa H. Koff A. Dotto G.P. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 3065-3075Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). One such condition is acute treatment of mouse skin with the phorbol ester tumor promoter TPA, which results in marked epidermal hyperplasia as well as mild inflammatory reaction by 24–48 h of exposure (Ref. 9Escherick J.S. DiCunto F. Flanders K.C. Missero C. Dotto G.P. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 5517-5522PubMed Google Scholar and references therein). When treated with TPA, the grafted epidermis of wild type and TGF-β1 knockout mice underwent a hyperplastic response similar to that of normal mouse skin (Fig. 2 A). Interestingly, a more pronounced inflammatory infiltrate was detectable in the grafts of TGF-β1 knockout skins, consistent with the immunosuppressive function of this specific isoform (3Shull M.M. Ormsby I. Kier A.B. Pawlowski S. Diebold R.J. Yin M. Allen R. Sidman C. Proetzel G. Calvin D. Annunziata N. Doetschman T. Nature. 1992; 359: 693-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (2641) Google Scholar). In marked contrast, TPA treatment of TGF-β3 knockout grafts induced widespread areas of keratinocyte cell death (Fig. 2 A). Keratinocytes in these areas exhibited mixed features of an apoptotic and necrotic process, with highly pyknotic nuclei and cell swelling (Fig. 2 A). Apoptotic cells as well as cells undergoing necrosis are characterized by increased nuclear DNA fragmentation, which can be detected by TUNEL assays (21Gavrieli Y. Sherman Y. Ben-Sasson S.A. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 493-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (9156) Google Scholar). Most of the pyknotic nuclei in the TPA-treated TGF-β3 knockout grafts stained positive by this assay, whereas no TUNEL positivity was detected in the TPA-treated wild type grafts nor in the acetone-treated controls (Fig. 2 B). In addition to cell death in the epidermis, the TPA-treated TGF-β3 knockout grafts exhibited signs of dermal necrosis. Many venules were also affected by granulomatous vasculitis with segmented fibrinoid necrosis of the cell walls, angiocentric histiocytosis, and endothelial swelling (data not shown). Capillaries showed evidence of microangiopathy with some vessels occluded by fibrin thrombi. None of these changes were found in similarly treated grafts of wild type or TGF-β1 knockout skins. The alterations of epidermal cells observed in the TGF-β3 knockout grafts after TPA treatment may be explained by a direct protective function of TGF-β3 on keratinocytes or, alternatively, to an indirect effect on the dermis. These possibilities were further tested in culture by examining whether exogenous addition of either TGF-β3 or TGF-β1 can protect primary keratinocytes from the effects of TPA. A significant fraction of growing keratinocytes in culture undergoes nuclear DNA fragmentation, which is likely because of the spontaneous continuous shedding of cells into the medium. TPA treatment of control keratinocytes significantly increased the fraction of cells exhibiting nuclear DNA fragmentation as early as 6–8 h after treatment (Fig.3 A). As previously reported for human keratinocytes (22Rorke E.A. Jacobberger J.W. Exp. Cell Res. 1995; 216: 65-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 23Benassi L. Ottani D. Fantini F. Marconi A. Chiodino C. Giannetti A. Pincelli C. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1997; 109: 276-282Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), TGF-β1 treatment was also by itself sufficient to increase the number of TUNEL-positive cells. Interestingly, no such effect was observed with TGF-β3 (Fig.3 A). More importantly, pretreatment of keratinocytes with this latter isoform suppressed the increase in TUNEL positivity induced by TPA, whereas no such protective effects were observed after pretreatment with TGF-β1 (Fig. 3 A). Staining of cells with calcein-AM/propidium iodide provides an alternative method to TUNEL assays to measure cell death (19Yu J.S. Sena-Esteves M. Paulus W. Breakefield X.O. Reeves S.A. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 5423-5427PubMed Google Scholar). This method relies on the ability of viable cells to cleave calcein/AM into calcein, generating a green fluorescent signal, whereas dying cells take up propidium iodide into the nucleus and become identifiable by red fluorescence. Experiments using this method confirmed that the death-inducing action of TPA was prevented by pretreatment of keratinocytes with the TGF-β3 but not TGF-β1 isoforms (Fig.3 B). One of the most important consequences of TPA treatment is detachment of keratinocytes from their substratum (Ref. 18Calautti E. Missero C. Stein P.L. Ezzell R.M. Dotto G.P. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 2279-2291Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar and references therein), which in turn can trigger programmed cell death (24Frisch S.M. Francis H. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 619-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (2775) Google Scholar). The protective function of TGF-β3 on TPA-induced cell death may be connected with specific effects on keratinocyte cell attachment. Focal adhesions serve as a bridge between integrin receptors and the actin cytoskeleton and provide an essential adhesive structure of keratinocytes in culture (25Burridge K. Fath K. Kelly T. Nuckolls G. Turner C. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1988; 4: 487-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (1701) Google Scholar). Keratinocytes were analyzed by double immunofluorescence with antibodies against vinculin, a specific focal adhesion component (detected with fluorescein isothiocyanate-coupled secondary antibodies;green) and phalloidin, for actin cable visualization (rhodamine-coupled; red). Samples were analyzed by confocal microscopy, and green and red images were superimposed. Focal adhesions and actin cables were readily detectable in control keratinocytes, whereas they were totally disrupted as early as 30 h after TPA exposure (Fig. 4, upper panels). By contrast, little or no disruption of actin cables and focal adhesions were induced by TPA in cells that had been pretreated with TGF-β3 for 18 h (Fig. 4, lower panels). Relative to TGF-β3, pretreatment with TGF-β1 had more limited counteracting effects on TPA-induced disruption of focal adhesions and disassembly of actin cables (Fig. 4, middle panels). In parallel with these findings, TPA treatment induced rounding up of keratinocytes by 6 h (Fig. 5 A) and detachment from the dish by 24 h (Fig. 5 B). These effects were almost totally prevented by pretreatment with TGF-β3, whereas TGF-β1 exerted a more partial protection (Fig. 5).Figure 5TPA-induced cell detachment and counteracting effects of TGF-β3. Primary mouse keratinocytes were either left untreated (Ctrl) or treated with TGF-β1 or TGF-β3 for 18 h before exposure to TPA (100 ng/ml) for either 6 h (A) or 24 h (B).Panel A, contrast phase microscopy (10×) illustrating the differential rounding up of cells after 6 h of TPA treatment, depending on whether or not cells were pretreated with TGF-β1 or TGF-β3. Panel B, keratinocyte cell detachment at 24 h of TPA treatment. Cells that had remained attached to the dish were trypsinized and counted, in parallel with those that had detached in the culture medium. Each condition was tested on duplicate dishes, and values are expressed as ratios of detached versus detached cells recovered from each dish.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Previous work has demonstrated that loss of keratinocyte cell adhesion can trigger JNK kinase activation (26Frisch S.M. Vuori K. Kelaita D. Sicks S. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1377-1382Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar), and preferential activation of the JNK versus ERK kinase can be a critical determinant of apoptosis (27Xia Z. Dickens M. Raingeaud J. Davis R.J. Greenberg M.E. Science. 1995; 270: 1326-1331Crossref PubMed Scopus (5034) Google Scholar). Differential modulation of these pathways could provide a mechanism for the specific protective effects of the TGF-β3 versus TGF-β1 isoforms on TPA-induced cell death. To test this possibility, primary keratinocytes were either untreated or treated with TGF-β1 or TGF-β3 (3 ng/ml) for 18 h followed by exposure to TPA for different lengths of time. Total cell extracts were incubated with beads coupled to the c-Jun protein to immunoprecipitate JNK or with phospho-specific antibody to the ERK1/2 kinase to immunoprecipitate the active form of this kinase. In vitro kinase assays were carried out using recombinant c-Jun or Elk1 proteins as substrates for the JNK and ERK1/2 kinases, respectively. In vitro kinase activity was normalized by the total amounts of JNK and ERK proteins present inside the cells, as determined by immunoblotting of the same cell extracts with antibodies against these proteins. A representative experiment is shown in Fig.6 A, whereas Fig. 6 Billustrates the composite quantification of three independent experiments. As reported for other cell types, treatment of mouse primary keratinocytes with TPA resulted in the early induction of JNK kinase activity, which returned to basal level or even below by 4–8 h of treatment. Activity of the related ERK kinase was also induced in the TPA-treated keratinocytes, with a similar time course of activation. Keratinocytes pretreated with TGF-β1 showed the same pattern of JNK activation in response to TPA as the control, with the exception that the basal level of JNK kinase activity appeared elevated in these cells even before TPA treatment. ERK kinase was induced in the TGF-β1-pretreated keratinocytes after exposure to TPA, but ERK activity levels remained consistently lower than in controls. In contrast, elevation of JNK activity in response to TPA was significantly delayed and/or suppressed in the TGF-β3-treated keratinocytes, whereas ERK activity was induced by TPA to a similar if not greater extent than in the controls. Thus, the relative ratio of JNK versus ERK activation was substantially lower in the TGF-β3 versus TGF-β1-treated keratinocytes (Fig. 6B), consistent with the specific counteracting effects of the first isoform on TPA-induced cell death. Previous data from a number of laboratories have shown that the TGF-β3 isoform is preferentially produced by dermal fibroblasts and not keratinocytes, and that in the skin, the presence of this factor in the epidermis is likely because of diffusion from the underlying dermis (9Escherick J.S. DiCunto F. Flanders K.C. Missero C. Dotto G.P. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 5517-5522PubMed Google Scholar, 11Derynck R. Lindquist P.B. Lee A. Wen D. Tamm J. Graycar J.L. Rhee L. Mason A.J. Miller D.A. Coffey R.J. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 3737-3743Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar, 12Missero C. Ramon y Cajal S. Dotto G.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chem. 1996; 271: 10188-10193Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). The present findings establish a unique function of TGF-β3 not shared by TGF-β1 as a specific isoform able to protect keratinocytes from the death-inducing effects of an agent such as TPA. These findings help to explain a long-standing discrepancy between thein vivo effects of TPA (induction of epidermal hyperplasia) and the effects of this agent on cultured keratinocytes (induction of growth arrest, differentiation, and as we have shown here, increased cell death). Because keratinocytes produce very little if any TGF-β3, these cells are intrinsically sensitive to the death-inducing effects of TPA but could be protected from these effects in vivo by the dermally produced TGF-β3. Apoptosis is typically associated with a multistage process of DNA fragmentation, cell shrinking, and lack of an inflammatory response (21Gavrieli Y. Sherman Y. Ben-Sasson S.A. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 493-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (9156) Google Scholar, 28Ellis R. Yuan J. Horvitz H.R. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1991; 7: 663-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (1945) Google Scholar, 29Collins R.J. Harmon B.V. Gobe G.C. Kerr J.F. Int. J. Radiat. Biol. 1992; 61: 451-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar). A necrosis reaction can also be associated with random DNA fragmentation, but it involves cell swelling and a significant inflammatory reaction (29Collins R.J. Harmon B.V. Gobe G.C. Kerr J.F. Int. J. Radiat. Biol. 1992; 61: 451-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar, 30Vaux D.L. Strasser A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 2239-2244Crossref PubMed Scopus (909) Google Scholar). The histological findings of the TGF-β3 knockout epidermis treated with TPA exhibited mixed features of apoptosis and necrosis. An increasing number of variant cell deaths have been described to which the dichotomy apoptosis/necrosis cannot be applied, and even biochemically, the distinction is less clear than expected (31Schwartz L.M. Smith S.W. Jones M.E. Osborne B.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 980-984Crossref PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar). For instance, it has recently been shown that well established inhibitors of apoptosis such as Bcl-2 and ICE inhibitors can also suppress classical necrosis (32Shimizu S. Eguchi Y. Kamiike W. Waguri S. Uchiyama Y. Matsuda H. Tsujimoto Y. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 2045-2050PubMed Google Scholar). In addition to cell death in the epidermis, the TPA-treated TGF-β3 knockout grafts showed evidence of dermal necrosis as well as microangiopathy. Our in vitrodata are consistent with the alterations of the epidermis being a primary consequence of keratinocyte exposure to TPA in the absence of the TGF-β3-protective function. However, alterations in the dermis and blood vessels could also contribute to keratinocyte cell death in the overlying epidermis. Under basal conditions, grafted epidermis of TGF-β3 knockout mice was histologically normal, and no increased apoptosis was observed. However, levels of TGF-β3 were reduced but not totally absent in these grafts, consistent with this factor diffusing to some extent from the neighboring skin in amounts that might be sufficient for normal skin maturation The mature TGF-β1, -β2, and -β3 isoforms share a >70% amino acid sequence identity, including conservation of the 8 cysteine residues that contribute to the correct folding of the monomers and the additional cysteine residue involved in subunit dimerization (33Massague J. Cheifetz S. Laiho M. Ralph D.A. Weis F.M. Zentella A. Cancer Surv. 1992; 12: 81-103PubMed Google Scholar). The sequence diversity among individual isoforms has been maintained throughout evolution, suggesting that they may have intrinsically distinct functions (34Kingsley D.M. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 133-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (1730) Google Scholar). In fact, although all three isoforms bind to type I and type II TGF-β receptors and exert similar effects on many cell types, in certain cases they behave selectively. For instance, TGF-β2 exerts little if any growth inhibitory effects on endothelial cells (35Qian S.W. Burmester J.K. Merwin J.R. Madri J.A. Sporn M.B. Roberts A.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 6290-6294Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), and this may be because of the lack of binding of TGF-β2 to endoglin, a major surface TGF-β-binding protein that coexists with the type I and type II TGF-β receptors on endothelial cells (36Cheifetz S. Bellon T. Cales C. Vera S. Bernabeu C. Massague J. Letarte M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 19027-19030Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Similarly, TGF-β3, unlike TGF-β1 and -β2, fails to bind to heparin and to liver heparan sulfate (37Lyon M. Rushton G. Gallagher J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18000-18006Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). These polysaccharides potentiate the biological activity of TGF-β1 by antagonizing the binding of this isoform and its inactivation by α2macroglobulin, a major TGF-β-binding protein found in serum and the intercellular space (38McCaffrey T.A. Falcone D.J. Brayton C.F. Agarwal L.A. Welt F.G. Weksler B.B. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 441-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). The differential binding of the TGF-β isoforms to heparin has been related to two specific basic residues at positions 26 and 60 in TGF-β1 and -β2, which are replaced by neutral ones in TGF-β3 (37Lyon M. Rushton G. Gallagher J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18000-18006Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). In primary mouse keratinocytes grown under our conditions, TGF-β1 and TGF-β3 were found to exert similar growth inhibitory effects and to induce a TGF-β-responsive promoter (3TP-luc) to a similar extent. 2J. Li, K. Foitzik, E. Calautti, H. Baden, T. Doetschman, and G. Paolo Dotto, unpublished observations. This is consistent with the fact that these factors bind type I and type II TGF-β receptors with similar affinity (1Hoodless P.A. Wrana J.L. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1998; 228: 235-272Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and are therefore expected to trigger similar downstream reponses. However, TGF-β1 treatment was by itself sufficient to increase the fraction of TUNEL positive keratinocytes, whereas no such effect was elicited by TGF-β3. More importantly, there was a substantial difference in the way pretreatment with TGF-β3 but not TGF-β1, protected keratinocytes from TPA-induced cell death. An attractive hypothesis is that TGF-β3, besides triggering type I and type II receptors to a similar extent as TGF-β1, binds specifically to other proteins on the keratinocyte cell surface, thus affecting behavior of these cells in additional manners. The protective function of TGF-β3 on TPA-induced cell death is not because of general suppression of TPA signaling, as ERK1/2 activation occurred to a similar if not greater extent in TGF-β3 treatedversus control keratinocytes. Instead, TGF-β3 treatment led to a significant reduction in TPA-induced JNK activity, whereas increased rather than decreased JNK activity was observed after treatment of the same cells with TGF-β1. Activation of ERK has been connected with growth stimulation of cells in response to a variety of stimuli, whereas induction of JNK has been closely related to apoptosis (39Whitmarsh A.J. Davis R.J. J. Mol. Med. 1996; 74: 589-607Crossref PubMed Scopus (1390) Google Scholar). In epithelial cells, one important inducer of JNK activity (and apoptosis) is loss of cell attachment to the substrate (40Frisch S. Ruoslahti E. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 701-706Crossref PubMed Scopus (988) Google Scholar). The rapid disruption of stress fibers and focal adhesions caused by TPA treatment was found to be effectively counteracted by TGF-β3, thus providing an attractive explanation for the protective effects of this isoform against TPA-induced cell death. A specific role of TGF-β3 in promoting epithelial cell adhesion is consistent with the major phenotype of TGF-β3 knockout mice in which cleft palate has been related to reduced adhesion of the epithelial medial edge (6Proetzel G.

Previous analysis of yeast origins suggests that they are relatively simple structures comprised of three or four small DNA sequence elements contained within approximately 100–200-base pair regions (Gilbert, D. M. (1998)Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 8, 194–199). In contrast, the sequence elements that may comprise origins in multicellular eukaryotes are largely unknown. The yeast HMR-E region is both a chromosomal origin of replication and a silencer that represses transcription of adjacent genes through a position effect. The analysis presented here indicated that HMR-E had a novel DNA structure that was more complex than defined for other yeast origins, and thus revealed that there is variation in the structural complexity of yeast origins. In contrast to “simple” yeast origins, the origin at HMR-E consisted of at least three independent subregions that had the capacity to initiate replication. We have termedHMR-E a compound origin to reflect its structural complexity. Furthermore, only one origin within the compound origin was a silencer. Eukaryotic chromosomal origins of replication are best defined in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Previous analysis of yeast origins suggests that they are relatively simple structures comprised of three or four small DNA sequence elements contained within approximately 100–200-base pair regions (Gilbert, D.

The regulation of DNA replication ensures that duplication of eukaryotic genomes occurs once per cell cycle. Initiation of replication is a primary control point in the regulation of replication (1Diffley J.F. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2819-2830Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar, 2Dutta A. Bell S.P.

The ORC (origin recognitioncomplex), Mcm2–7p (minichromosomemaintenance), and Cdc6p (celldivision cycle) proteins, which were identified in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and are required for initiation of replication, are conserved among eukaryotes, suggesting that at least some of the underlying mechanisms of regulating initiation are conserved. However, other features of replication do not appear to be conserved; in particular, the DNA structure of origins appears to differ among eukaryotes (4Gilbert D.M. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1998; 8: 194-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Eukaryotic origins of replication are best characterized in S. cerevisiae. In S. cerevisiae it is possible to define the elements that comprise origins by combining techniques that map origins to specific chromosomal regions with site-directed mutagenesis of those regions. This type of analysis, in addition to analysis of plasmid origins (ARS elements; autonomousreplicating sequence), has led to the model that yeast origins are relatively simple structures comprised of an “A” element and two to three “B” elements that direct initiation to a single site (5Gerbi S.A.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 555-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). In yeast, ORC is bound to origins throughout the cell cycle and is required for the regulated assembly and disassembly of an Mcm2–7p/Cdc6p-containing complex that limits initiation to once per cell cycle (1Diffley J.F. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2819-2830Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar, 2Dutta A. Bell S.P. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1997; 13: 293-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar, 3Newlon C.S.

In particular, in Schizosaccharomyces pombe,Drosophila melanogaster, Sciara coprophila, Tetrahymena thermophila, and mammalian cell lines, sites of initiation map to defined chromosomal regions, suggesting that sequences within these regions are required for initiation of replication (20Aladjem M.I.

Biol. 1997; 17: 6147-6156Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). In cases where it has been possible to dissect these regions genetically, specific sequences have been shown to be required for initiation. For example, at least four S. pombeARS elements contain distinct DNA regions that, when deleted, result in loss of initiation (24Dubey D.D. Zhu J. Carlson D.L. Sharma K. Huberman J.A. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3638-3647Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 32Dubey D.D. Kim S.M. Todorov I.T. Huberman J.A. Curr.

Dubey D.D. Sharma K. Huberman J.A. Chromosoma. 1994; 103: 414-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Additionally, recent genetic dissection of one mammalian origin, the human β-globin origin, indicates that initiation is dependent upon particular sequences at this locus (20Aladjem M.I. Rodewald L.W. Kolman J.L. Wahl G.M. Science. 1998; 281: 1005-1009Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, a requirement for specific sequences is a conserved feature of at least some eukaryotic origins. Other features of yeast origins do not appear to be conserved among eukaryotes. For instance, origins in S. cerevisiae are approximately 100–200 bp in length, whereas those in S. pombe are 500 bp to 2.0 kb in size, and some origins in multicellular eukaryotes are several kilobases in length (32Dubey D.D. Kim S.M. Todorov I.T. Huberman J.A. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 467-473Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 35Zhu J. Carlson D.L. Dubey D.D. Sharma K. Huberman J.A.

Dowell S.J. Diffley J.F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1217: 239-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). In addition, unlike the single site of initiation at yeast origins, multiple sites of initiation have been identified at origins in multicellular eukaryotes (30Wang S. Dijkwel P.A. Hamlin J.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 39-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 38Donovan S. Diffley J.F. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1996; 6: 203-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 39Kobayashi T.

The human β-globin locus, for example, contains two to four sites of initiation within an 8.0-kb region (20Aladjem M.I. Rodewald L.W. Kolman J.L. Wahl G.M. Science. 1998; 281: 1005-1009Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, studies of the DHFR locus identified two potentially preferred sites of initiation, and several additional sites of initiation spread throughout a 60-kb region (30Wang S. Dijkwel P.A. Hamlin J.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 39-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar,39Kobayashi T. Rein T. DePamphilis M.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3266-3277Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 41Vaughn J.P. Dijkwel P.A. Hamlin J.L. Cell. 1990; 61: 1075-1087Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Collectively, these data suggest that, although the proteins that regulate initiation of replication are conserved, the structure and complexity of origins may vary among eukaryotes. This study focused, in part, on the possibility that chromosomal origins in yeast may vary in complexity. In particular, we analyzed initiation of replication at the HMR silent mating-type locus of S. cerevisiae. The HMR-E silencer is a control region that is required for heterochromatin-mediated silencing of the mating-type genes at HMR. In addition to its role in gene silencing, an origin of replication maps to the HMR-E silencer. Furthermore, the ACS element of the silencer contributes to both silencing and initiation of chromosomal replication (42Rivier D.H. Rine J. Science. 1992; 256: 659-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Previous analysis also indicates that two distinct segments of HMR, each of which contains a different part of the HMR-E silencer, have ARS activity (43Brand A.H. Micklem G. Nasmyth K. Cell. 1987; 51: 709-719Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Although only some ARS elements are origins in their native chromosomal context, this observation raises the possibility that HMR-E may be more complex than other yeast origins. In this report, we investigated whether HMR-E contained more than one origin. The work presented here revealed thatHMR-E is a compound origin that contains three regions which can independently function as chromosomal and plasmid origins of replication. This result suggests that some S. cerevisiaeorigins are more complex than the “simple” origins described previously. Furthermore, one of the three independent origins was a silencer, whereas the other two were not. Prior analysis indicated that HMR-E had a property referred to as centromere antagonism, which can interfere with mitotic stability assays. Centromere antagonism is experimentally defined as the reduced mitotic stability of a plasmid containing bothHMR-E and a centromere relative to one containing onlyHMR-E (44Kimmerly W.J. Rine J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 4225-4237Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 45McNally F.J. Rine J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 5648-5659Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Although its molecular basis is not clear, we hypothesize that centromere antagonism may result from local action of the silencer interfering with centromere function. Previous plasmids used in mitotic stability assays contained HMR-E silencer sequences adjacent to centromere and marker sequences. In this study, a new test plasmid was constructed to minimize centromere antagonism, so that mitotic stability values would accurately reflect ARS activity. This plasmid, pDR1149, contained one polylinker for the insertion of potential ARS elements, and a second polylinker, on the opposite side of the plasmid, which contained URA3 and CEN6. This placement maximized the distance between ARS elements andCEN6. To determine whether pDR1149 was free of centromere antagonism, a 2.2-kb HMR-E fragment was inserted into the polylinker and its mitotic stability was determined. This plasmid was 3-fold more stable than a derivative that contained HMR-E, but not CEN6. Therefore, centromere antagonism was either minimized or eliminated in pDR1149. The sequence of pDR1149 has been submitted to GenBank (AF106619) and, hence, is only briefly described here. The polylinker of pUC18 was replaced by the Bluescript SK+ polylinker, and a second polylinker, comprised of PmeI, PacI, AscI, andFseI restriction sites, was inserted opposite to it using the following oligonucleotides: 5′-GGCCGGCCGACTGGCGCGCCTCAGTTAATTAAGCATGTTTAAACGGAACGAAAACTCACGTTAAGGG-3′ and 5′-GTTTAAACATGCTTAATTAACTGAGGCGCGCCAGTCGGCCGGCCACTGAGCGTCAGACCCCGTAG-3′.PacI and PmeI sites were added to URA3by PCR amplification of pJJ244 (46Jones J.S. Prakash L. Yeast. 1990; 6: 363-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar) using the oligonucleotide primers 5′-GCCTTAATTAAGCTTTTCAATTCATCTTTTTTTTTTTTGTTC-3′ and 5′-CGGGTTTAAACGGGTAATAACTGATATAATTAAATTGAAGCTC-3′ to allow cloning of URA3 into the second polylinker. Similarly,AscI and PacI sites were added to CEN6by PCR amplification of pRS415 (47Gietz R.D. Sugino A. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 74: 527-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (2519) Google Scholar) using the oligonucleotide primers 5′-CTTGGCGCGCCCCGAAAAGTGCCACCTGGG-3′ and 5′-ACCTTAATTAAGTTGGCGATCCCCCTAGAG-3′ to allow cloning ofCEN6 adjacent to URA3. A polylinker comprised ofSfiI, EcoNI, EcoRI, andSgrAI restriction sites was inserted betweenEcoO109I and AatII sites using oligonucleotide primers 5′-GGAGTCAGGGCCTCTAGTGGCCACTGAGGCCTAGTCCTAGATCAGGTCACGAATTCGTCACACCGGTGACTGGACGTCAGTC-3′ and 5′-GGCCGGCCGACTGGCGCGCCTCAGTTAATTAAGCATGTTTTAACGGAACGAAAACTCACGTTAAGGGG-3′. The resulting plasmid, pDR1149, was used to test for ARS activity and to measure mitotic stability. Alleles of HMR-E that lacked native spacing, described in detail below, were cloned into pDR1149 as EcoRI-FspI fragments that contained 1356 bp of DNA flanking HMR-E. Alleles of HMR-E that maintained native spacing were cloned into pDR1149 asEcoRI-HindIII fragments that contained 2841 bp of flanking DNA. Expand Polymerase (Boehringer Mannheim) was used in all PCR reactions according to manufacturer's recommended conditions. A polylinker containing the restriction sites NotI, KpnI, BamHI, and XhoI was inserted at HMR in place of the 868-bp region of HMR-E using oligonucleotides 5′-CCGGATCGTCGACGCGGCCGCTTGGGTACCCGTGGATCCTCCCTCGAGCGCCG- 3′ and 5′-CGGCGCTCGAGGGAGGATCCACGGGTACCCAAGCGGCCGCGTCGACGATCCGG-3′. Each of the three subregions of HMR-E was cloned into pDR1149 by addition of restriction sites using PCR amplification. All alleles ofHMR-E were confirmed by DNA sequence analysis. The oligonucleotides used to amplify the HMR-E alleles were: 5′GCACGCGCGGCCGCATAGGCTAGATCGTAATCCACTACG-3′ and 5′-GCACGCGGTACCAAAAAATCAAACATTGTTTAATAAA-3′ (L subregion), 5′-GCACGCGGATCCCTTAATCTTCCATAAAAATATTTGA-3′ and 5′-GCACGCCTCGAGTATGACGATAAAATTTTTGTTTTTC-3′ (R subregion). The 138-bp silencer was isolated from pDR291 (43Brand A.H. Micklem G. Nasmyth K. Cell. 1987; 51: 709-719Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar) as aKpnI-BamHI restriction fragment. The oligonucleotides used to amplify sections of LYS2 DNA for the substitution analysis were 5′-GAATGCGGCCGCGTTTCTTATTTCGAAGTTAAATCAA-3′ and 5′-CGGCCATGGATGTTGGCTCATTGTCGGCATT-3′ (L subregion), 5′-CGGGGTACCATCACATTTATGGTCCCAAGATTTGA-3′ and 5′-GCAGGATCCGAAAGTCCTGATGTCCTTGGATAAAA-3′ (138-bp silencer), and 5′-GCGGGATCCACTTTCTTAAAGAAAAGATTGGCTAG-3′ and 5′-GCCCTCGAGACCATAAGTCTCTAACCTCGCGCTCA (R subregion).HMR-E alleles were integrated into the genome as described previously (48Fox C.A. Loo S. Dillin A. Rine J. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 911-924Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Allelic replacement at HMR-E was confirmed by DNA blot analysis. Mitotic stability assays were as described previously (45McNally F.J. Rine J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 5648-5659Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) with the following modifications; cultures were diluted into liquid casamino acid medium supplemented with uracil, and each sample was analyzed at a minimum of six time points during logarithmic growth. The rate of plasmid loss per generation was calculated as L = 1 − 10m, where L is the loss rate per generation (mitotic stability) and m is the change in the fraction of cells containing the plasmid per cell division (49Loo S. Fox C.A. Rine J. Kobayashi R. Stillman B. Bell S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 741-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Mitotic stability values reported were the average of values from three independent trials. Replication intermediates were isolated and analyzed as described previously (42Rivier D.H. Rine J. Science. 1992; 256: 659-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Briefly, genomic DNA was isolated from 1010 log-phase cells in an asynchronous culture and digested to completion with HindIII. Replication intermediates were enriched by benzoylated napthoylated DEAE cellulose chromatography (Sigma) and then subjected to two-dimensional electrophoresis (50Brewer B.J. Fangman W.L. Cell. 1987; 51: 463-471Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (803) Google Scholar). Intermediates were then transferred to Zeta-probe membrane (Bio-Rad) and hybridized as described previously (42Rivier D.H. Rine J. Science. 1992; 256: 659-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Rich medium (YPD) and casamino acid medium were as described previously (51Sherman F. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 3-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (2543) Google Scholar). Mating assays were performed as described previously using DRY1226 as the tester lawn (52Ehrenhofer-Murray A.E. Rivier D.H. Rine J. Genetics. 1997; 145: 923-934Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Transformation was by a modified lithium-acetate method (53Gietz R.D. Schiestl R.H. Yeast. 1991; 7: 253-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). All strains were isogenic to DRY434 (MATα HMRa-ΔI ade2–1 his3–11, 15 leu2–3, 112 trp1–1 ura3–1), which is an isogenic derivative of W303–1a that lacks theHMR-I silencer. Previous characterization of the DNA sequence elements that comprise the HMR-E origin and silencer focused primarily on the identification of the minimal set of elements required for silencing and for initiation of replication (42Rivier D.H. Rine J. Science. 1992; 256: 659-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 43Brand A.H. Micklem G. Nasmyth K.

Rine J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 5648-5659Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Deletion of an 868-bp region of HMR, referred to here as HMR-E, removes both silencer and origin function (42Rivier D.H. Rine J. Science. 1992; 256: 659-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 43Brand A.H. Micklem G. Nasmyth K. Cell. 1987; 51: 709-719Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar, 44Kimmerly W.J. Rine J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 4225-4237Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 45McNally F.J. Rine J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 5648-5659Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 48Fox C.A. Loo S. Dillin A. Rine J. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 911-924Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Replacement ofHMR-E with a 138-bp subregion of HMR-E, containing a perfect match to the ACS and two transcription factor binding sites, restores silencing and initiation of replication (42Rivier D.H. Rine J. Science. 1992; 256: 659-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar,45McNally F.J. Rine J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 5648-5659Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). The 138-bp subregion can, therefore, restore silencer and origin function independent of other HMR-E regions. In addition to the perfect 11/11 bp ACS at the 138-bp silencer, several 9/11 or 10/11 bp near-matches to the ACS reside in the vicinity of the silencer (44Kimmerly W.J. Rine J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 4225-4237Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Analysis of the 868-bp HMR-E region identified 27 9/11 or 10/11 bp near-matches to the ACS, including nine cases in which the near-matches overlapped by 5 or more base pairs (data not shown). This observation led us to question whether regions other than the 138-bp silencer contributed to initiation of replication at HMR-E. For instance, some of the near-matches may be components of additional, unidentified origins within HMR-E. Alternatively, the near-matches may contribute to initiation at the previously identified 138-bp silencer, much as B elements contribute to initiation at other yeast origins. An additional possibility is that the near-matches may play no role in initiation. To determine whether regions of HMR-E other than the 138-bp silencer contributed to initiation, HMR-E was divided into three subsections: the previously defined 138-bp silencer (HMRΔE::138), the 520-bp region to the left of the 138-bp silencer, the L allele (HMRΔE::L), and the 207-bp region to the right of the 138-bp silencer, the R allele (HMRΔE::R). An additional construct included all of HMR-E except for the 138-bp silencer, the L+R allele (HMRΔE::L+R). To explore the possible role of these subregions in replication, each was tested for the ability to support autonomous replication of a plasmid (ARS activity), as measured by high frequency transformation. Each HMR-E allele was flanked by approximately 1.3 kb of HMR DNA to avoid any potential influence from heterologous plasmid DNA. In this context, a plasmid that lacked HMR-E (pDR1155) was not capable of high frequency transformation, whereas one that contained the 138-bp silencer (pDR1161) was (Fig.1 A). These data indicated that the DNA flanking HMR-E did not contain an ARS element and confirmed previous observations that the 138-bp silencer is an ARS element. To determine whether HMR-E contained an ARS element in addition to the 138-bp silencer, the L+R allele (pDR1167) was tested for ARS activity. Similar to the 138-bp silencer, the L+R allele was capable of high frequency transformation, which revealed thatHMR-E is comprised of at least two separable ARS elements. To map more precisely the additional ARS element(s), the L allele (pDR1163) and the R allele (pDR1165) were tested for ARS activity independent of one another. Both alleles were capable of high frequency transformation (Fig. 1 A). Thus, HMR-E contained at least three separable ARS elements. Origins of replication in yeast exhibit a wide range of initiation efficiency, with some origins initiating replication in greater than 85% of cell cycles and others in less than 10% of cell cycles (54Friedman K.L. Brewer B.J. Fangman W.L. Genes Cells. 1997; 2: 667-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). To assess the relative initiation efficiency of the threeHMR-E ARS elements, the mitotic stability of plasmids containing each of the individual alleles was determined. Wild-typeHMR-E (pDR1159) was the most efficient origin (Fig.1 A). The 138-bp (pDR1161) and L+R alleles (pDR1167) were comparable to one another and were slightly less efficient than wild-type. The L allele (pDR1163) was less efficient than the 138-bp silencer, and the R allele (pDR1165) was the least efficient plasmid-based origin (Fig. 1 A). Taken together, these results indicated that the three HMR-E ARS elements vary in their efficiency of initiation. Not all ARS elements are origins of replication in their native chromosomal contexts (55Dubey D.D. Davis L.R. Greenfeder S.A. Ong L.Y. Zhu J.G. Broach J.R. Newlon C.S. Huberman J.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 5346-5355Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 56Fangman W.L. Brewer B.J. Annu. Rev. Cell. Biol. 1991; 7: 375-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). To establish if any of theHMR-E subregions could function as chromosomal origins, each of the above HMR-E alleles was integrated into the chromosome in place of the wild-type HMR-E locus and subjected to a two-dimensional gel electrophoresis method (50Brewer B.J. Fangman W.L. Cell. 1987; 51: 463-471Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (803) Google Scholar). The replication intermediates of genomic regions that contain an origin are bubble-shaped, whereas the replication intermediates of genomic regions that do not contain an origin are fork-shaped. Bubble- and fork-shaped replication intermediates each yield distinctive arc patterns when separated on two-dimensional agarose gels and subjected to DNA blot analysis. The presence of a bubble arc indicates that the chromosomal region examined contains an origin, whereas the absence of such an arc indicates that the chromosomal region does not contain an origin. As described above, yeast origins vary in the efficiency with which they initiate replication (54Friedman K.L. Brewer B.J. Fangman W.L. Genes Cells. 1997; 2: 667-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar); consequently, regions that contain origins typically give rise to both bubble and fork arcs (50Brewer B.J. Fangman W.L. Cell. 1987; 51: 463-471Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (803) Google Scholar). As reported previously, chromosome-derived restriction fragments from strains that contained either the wild-type HMR-E allele (DRY434) or the 138-bp silencer (DRY1285) gave rise to bubble arcs, confirming that both are chromosomal origins of replication (42Rivier D.H. Rine J. Science. 1992; 256: 659-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar) (Fig.1 B). Restriction fragments from strains that contained the L+R allele (DRY 1293) also gave rise to a bubble arc, which indicated the presence of at least two independent chromosomal origins withinHMR-E (Fig. 1 B). Furthermore, analysis of the individual L (DRY1287) and R alleles (DRY1283) indicated that each gave rise to a bubble arc. These data revealed that HMR-E is composed of at least three subregions that could function independently as chromosomal origins of replication. In each of the HMR-E alleles described above, the spacing among the various HMR-E subregions and the flanking DNA varied. To determine whether each of the three subregions ofHMR-E was an origin when native spacing was maintained relative to each other and the flanking DNA, each subregion was replaced with DNA from the LYS2 gene (Fig.2 A). This DNA lacked any near-matches to the ACS and was typical of the AT/GC content of the yeast genome. Furthermore, the LYS2 DNA was derived from the coding region of the gene and was, thus, unlikely to contain any cryptic regulatory elements. The HMR-E allele in which all three subregions were replaced with LYS2 (HMR(LYS2)) DNA did not have ARS activity when inserted into a plasmid (pDR1198) (Fig.2 A). Similarly, chromosome-derived restriction fragments from strains that contained this allele integrated in place of the wild-type HMR-E locus (DRY1779) did not give rise to a bubble arc (Fig. 2 B). These results indicated that the DNA used to maintain spacing did not function as an ARS element or a chromosomal origin. Both the 138-bp silencer (HMR(LYS2)::138) and the L+R allele (HMR(LYS2)::L+R) with native spacing were ARS elements when inserted into a plasmid (pDR1206 and pDR1202, respectively) (Fig. 2). Restriction fragments from strains containing either of these chromosomal alleles (DRY1781 and DRY1783, respectively) gave rise to bubble arcs. Hence, in the context of wild-type spacing,HMR-E was comprised of at least two separable origins. Both the L (HMR(LYS2)::L) and R (HMR(LYS2)::R) plasmid-based alleles with native spacing also had ARS activity. In addition, chromosomal restriction fragments containing either of these two alleles gave rise to bubble arcs (DRY1785 and DRY1787, respectively) (Fig. 2).HMR-E, therefore, contained a minimum of three subregions that were independent origins of replication in two plasmid contexts as well as two chromosomal contexts. The R allele (DRY1787) in which spacing was maintained reproducibly gave rise to a weakly detectable bubble arc (Fig. 2 B and data not shown), which suggested that the R subregion contained an inefficient origin. This idea was supported by mitotic stability assays, which indicated that the R allele (pDR1204) was a relatively inefficient origin of replication when contained on a plasmid (Fig.2 A). Similarly, mitotic stability assays of the L+R (pDR1202), 138-bp silencer (pDR1206), and L (pDR1196) alleles with native spacing indicated that each was a less efficient origin than wild-type HMR-E (pDR1159). The observation that HMR-E contained three subregions that could initiate replication raised the possibility that HMR-E might also contain multiple subregions that could repress transcription. The ability of the three HMR-E subregions to function as silencers was assessed by a mating type assay. HaploidMATα cells in which HMR a is silent display the α mating phenotype, whereas haploid MATα cells in which HMR a is not silent display the non-mating phenotype. Among the series of chromosomal HMR-E alleles that either lacked or maintained wild-type spacing, only the alleles that contained the 138-bp silencer could repress transcription (Fig. 3 and data not shown). Thus, although the L and R subregions were origins, they were not silencers. The HMR-E compound origin, therefore, contained only one silencer element. The results presented here revealed that HMR-E contained at least three contiguous subregions that could direct initiation of replication. The organization of this origin region contrasts with previously defined yeast origins, which have “simple” structures and span approximately 100–200 bp (7Walker S.S. Malik A.K. Eisenberg S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 6255-6262Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 8Marahrens Y. Stillman B. Science. 1992; 255: 817-823Crossref PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar, 9Rao H.

We refer toHMR-E as a compound origin to reflect its relatively large size and structural complexity. Our data indicated that origins in yeast may be simple or compound, and thus, yeast origins may vary in structural complexity. In addition, this work established that only one origin within the compound origin has the unique properties required for gene silencing. At least two models can account for the structural complexity of the compound origin. One model is that the compound HMR-E origin consists of a cluster of three or more autonomous, simple origins. By this model, each autonomous origin is likely to “compete” with the others for initiation, similar to origins experimentally placed adjacent to one another (57Brewer B.J. Fangman W.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 3418-3422Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 58Marahrens Y. Stillman B. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3395-3400Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). At the other extreme, the compound origin at HMR-E could consist of a single complex origin rather than a collection of simple origins. By this model, the various subregions of HMR-E could interact, such that each contributes to the overall efficiency of initiation of that genomic region. We thank K. Replogle and J.

Sequence analysis of more than 40 complete cDNA sequences and biochemical investigations of them have defined two major classes of these proteins: (a) those residing on the plasma membrane (PMCA), 1The abbreviations used are: PMCA, plasma membrane calcium adenosine triphosphatase; SERCA, sarcoendoplasmic reticulum calcium adenosine triphosphatase; EST, expressed sequence tag; PCR, polymerase chain reaction. which are stimulated by interaction with calmodulin (for reviews, see Refs. 1Carafoli E.

The complexity of these protein families makes their study difficult, stressing the advantages of more accessible unicellular models that are amenable to genetic manipulation, such as yeast (for a review, see Ref.6Catty P. Goffeau A. Biosci. Rep. 1996; 16: 75-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Whereas the yeast model has contributed to the advancement of our understanding of the roles calcium pumps play in various cellular processes (7Cunningham K.W. Fink G.R. J. Exp.

Biol. 1996; 16: 2226-2237Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar), the yeast cell, with its rigid wall, is closer to plants in that a major calcium storage organelle appears to be vacuole, rather than sarcoplasmic reticulum. This limits the projection of the yeast model to understanding the role of these proteins in a mammalian cell. Increasing evidence that the plasma membrane-based calcium transporters reside at specific subcellular structures, such as the caveolae (reviewed in Ref. 11Monteith G.R. Roufogalis B.D. Cell Calcium. 1995; 18: 459-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar), and other differences between animal and plant cell architecture demand a more adequate model of an animal cell than the yeast cell. One may add that despite substantial conservation of the protein structure, the modes of gene regulation of mammalian and yeast ATPase genes are likely to have very little in common. The study of the transcriptional regulation of PMCA genes is a technically challenging task (12Hilfiker H. Strehler-Page M.-A. Stauffer T.P. Carafoli E. Strehler E.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19717-19725Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) that is unlikely to be approached systematically before the sequence of at least one mammalian genome becomes available. Moreover, in mammalian systems, promoter studies are limited to tissues that are amenable to temporal cultivation and transient transfection. Whereas solitary examples of PMCA gene overexpression (13Guerini D. Schröder S. Foletti D. Carafoli E. J. Biol.

The nematode Caenorhabditis elegans is an established model for developmental and neurogenetic studies and is the first multicellular organism whose genome sequence is soon to be completed. More than half of the C. elegans genes have a significant match to a mammalian gene with a similar or identical function (reviewed in Ref. 15Ahringer J. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1997; 7: 410-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Thus, it represents a unique model for studies of calcium homeostasis in a genetically manipulatable multicellular organism.

A putative SERCA-type pump was cloned from the parasitic nematode Schistosoma mansoni (21de Mendonca R.L. Beck E. Rumjanek F.D. Goffeau A. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1995; 72: 129-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). In contrast to mammalian systems, an essentially complete catalog of candidate calcium transporters will be derived from genomic sequencing data in the near future. As a step toward this goal, we have characterized a family of C. elegans calcium ATPases, which appear to be similar to the mammalian PMCA family and are apparently regulated by multipartite promoters. BLAST (22Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (71456) Google Scholar) searches of the Wormpep database with the amino acid sequence CSDKTGTLT were run on the C. elegansWorld Wide Web server at the Sanger Center (Cambridge, United Kingdom). Clones identified in the EST database were clustered using the Sequencher program (Gene Codes, Ann Arbor, MI) and further analyzed with this program and with the GCG package v.8.0 (23Devereux J. Haeberli P. Smithies O. Nucleic Acids Res. 1984; 12: 387-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (11531) Google Scholar). Clones with the largest cDNA inserts for each cluster were obtained from Y. Kohara (Institute of Genetics, Mishima, Japan) and sequenced using IR800-labeled dye primers on a Li-Cor 4000L automated sequencer. Sequence analyses were run through the World Wide Web interface at the Swiss Bioinformatics Institute (http://www.isb-sib.ch/). Strain N2 was obtained from theCaenorhabditis Genetics Stock Center and propagated according to established methods. Total RNA was isolated from about 500 mg of worms using Trizol reagent (Life Technologies AG, Basel, Switzerland). 250 μg of total RNA were used to prepare polyadenylated RNA using Oligotex columns according to the manufacturer's procedures (Qiagen AG, Basel, Switzerland). RNA was eluted in 20 μl of water, split into two portions, and immediately used to synthesize cDNA using Expand reverse transcriptase (Boehringer Mannheim AG, Rotkreuz, Switzerland) and either oligo dT20-Not primer or hexamer primer (Pharmacia Biotech AG, Dubendorf, Switzerland). The completed cDNA reaction was kept at 4 °C and was typically used up within a month. Reverse transcription-PCR was carried out using the Expand Long Template PCR kit (Boehringer Mannheim) with one of several gene-specific primers and SL1-specific primer 5′-CGCGGGTTTAATTACCCAAGTTTGAG. A PCR product extending from the penultimate base preceding the AUG codon to the unique AvaI site was prepared from cDNA and joined to the AvaI-cut plasmid clone yk49f8 (obtained from Y. Kohara). To introduce a FLAG-tagging sequence, the fragment between the unique PshAI site in the cDNA and the XbaI site after the stop codon was replaced by a double-stranded synthetic oligonucleotide, coding for the respective C-terminal sequence (VDMEDIELN) followed by the FLAG sequence, a new stop codon, and a XbaI site. The correct clone was selected by DNA sequencing. A pFastBac clone with the FLAG-tagged cDNA was transferred into the bacmid, following the instructions of the baculovirus expression kit manufacturer (Bac-to-Bac; Life Technologies). The positive clone DNA was quantitated by fluorometry and introduced into Sf9 cells essentially following the instructions supplied with the transfection reagent (Lipofectin; Life Technologies). The cells were allowed to recover in TNM FH medium containing 10% fetal calf serum and 50 μg/ml hygromycin (Sigma) for 72 h, and the virus-containing medium was collected. After a second infection with the virus, the cells were grown in the same medium and harvested after 48 h. Crude membranes were prepared essentially as described previously (24Heim R. Iwata T.

Aliquots of the membranes (2 μl) were analyzed on 5% Protogel gels (National Diagnostics, Atlanta, GA) containing the buffer system of Laemmli (25Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar) and electroblotted (26Towbin H. Staehlin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44939) Google Scholar) onto a reinforced nitrocelulose membrane (OptiTran BA-S 85; Schleicher and Schull, Dassel, Germany). The blots were probed with the monoclonal antibody Anti-FLAG M2 (Kodak Scientific Imaging Systems, Rochester, NY) at a 1:5000 dilution using the ECL Western kit (Amersham Switzerland). Aliquots of the crude membrane preparation (30 μg of protein) were incubated with assay solutions containing either various cations (100 μmCaCl2, 100 μm LaCl3, or both) or 5 mm EGTA and 0.3 μm[γ-32P]ATP (Amersham) in a volume of 50 μl, essentially as described previously (13Guerini D. Schröder S. Foletti D. Carafoli E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14643-14650Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), and analyzed on 5% Protogel containing the buffer system of Sarkadi et al. (27Sarkadi B. Enyedi A. Földes-Papp Z. Gardos G. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 9552-9557Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The gels also contained the Rainbow protein marker (Amersham). The gels were dried on Whatman 3MM paper in a gel dryer at 65 °C for 1 h and exposed to a storage phosphor screen (Kodak) for 2 h or overnight. The screen was scanned in a STORM imager and analyzed with ImageQuant 1.2 software (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). Membrane proteins of Sf9 cells were resolved by electrophoresis in 5% Protogel gels and electroblotted onto Immobilon-P membrane (Millipore, Bedford, MA). After electroblotting, the membrane was cut into strips containing three tracks each (membrane proteins from untransfected cells, cells transfected with the mca1 construct, and cells transfected with the human pmca4 construct (31Hilfiker H. Guerini D. Carafoli E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26178-26183Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), respectively) and washed twice with Ca-Tris-buffered saline (25 mm Tris-HCl, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, and 200 μm CaCl2). The strips were incubated for 1 h in the blocking solution (Ca-Tris-buffered saline supplemented with 3% gelatine and 0.05% Tween 20), washed twice with TBST buffer (Ca-Tris-buffered saline, supplemented with 0.05% gelatine and 0.05% Tween 20), and incubated with biotinylated calmodulin dilutions in TBST buffer at a concentration ranging from 10 nm to 1 μm for 2 h at room temperature. One of the strips was incubated with 1 μm calmodulin as described above, but 200 μm CaCl2 in all buffers was replaced with 6 mm EGTA. Strips were subsequently washed three times with TBST buffer, and biotin binding was visualized using a streptavidin-alkaline phosphatase conjugate (Promega, Madison, WI) at a 1:1000 dilution, essentially as suggested by the manufacturer of the conjugate. Systematic searches of C. elegans databases available on-line from the Sanger Center have identified three sets (Table I) of relatively abundant EST clones with a high degree of similarity to mammalian calcium ATPases of the PMCA family (Fig. 1). These sequences are located on C. elegans chromosome IV and show about 70% similarity to each other. Clones were obtained from the Institute of Genetics (Mishima, Japan) and completed by reverse transcription-PCR, taking into account the fact that two-thirds of the C. elegans mRNAs are trans-spliced to the same 22-nucleotide leader SL1 (28Davis R.E. Singh H. Botka C. Hardwick C. el Meanawy M.A. Villanueva J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20026-20030Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 29Davis R.E. Parasitol. Today. 1996; 12: 33-40Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). In this experiment, however, it was found that the transcripts always contained alternative 5′ ends, only one of which was predicted by GeneFinder scanning of the genomic sequence. In one case, examination of the available genomic sequence (cosmid W09C2) upstream of the predicted exon 2 (Fig.2 A) resulted in the unambiguous localization of all four alternative 5′ ends, which are followed by a consensus splicing signal. Thus, the transcription of this gene is apparently driven by a multipartite promoter, which is spread over 4 kilobases. This analysis also showed that every alternative exon appended an amino acid sequence to the basic form of the protein, which is encoded in exon 2 and in the exons downstream. The shortest form of mca-1 cDNA was used in the expression experiments.Table ICandidate calcium ATPases found in the C. elegans Genome Project dataGeneChromosomeGenomic cloneEST cloneTranscript length (kb)mca-1IVW09C2yk49f84.4mca-2IVY76B12yk44a64.0mca-3IVY67D8yk186e44.6 Open table in a new tab Figure 2Structure of the 5′ terminus of themca-1 gene.

A crude membrane preparation from infected cells showed a new protein band of ∼130 kDa that bound monoclonal antibody M2 (Fig.3 A), confirming that the full-length open reading frame W09C2.3 was expressed in Sf9 cells. A crude membrane preparation from baculovirus-infected cells was then subjected to the functional assay (30Pedersen P.L. Carafoli E. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1987; 12: 146-150Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (823) Google Scholar) for P-type ATPases; in the case of the PMCA pump, the rapid degradation of the intermediate can typically be slowed down by lanthanum, allowing its detection in acidic gel systems (27Sarkadi B. Enyedi A. Földes-Papp Z. Gardos G. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 9552-9557Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The results of the assay showed that a clear signal in the 130-kDa area could be detected in infected cells, even if the expression level of the new protein was low. The signal was not present in the control counterparts (Fig. 3 B). The phosphointermediate pattern, i.e. an extremely weak (if any) reaction in the presence of calcium alone, the absence of reaction in the presence of EGTA, and, especially, the increase in the steady-state level of the phosphointermediate in the presence of lanthanum and calcium corresponded to that observed with pumps of the PMCA family (24Heim R. Iwata T. Zvaritch E. Adamo H.P. Rutishauser B. Strehler E.E. Guerini D. Carafoli E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 24476-24484Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 31Hilfiker H. Guerini D.

An endogenous P-type ATPase of 110–120 kDa was also detected by the assay, but it was clearly Ca2+independent (curiously, its phosphoenzyme formation was inhibited in cells expressing the mca-1 construct). The nature of this putative P-type ATPase, which is routinely observed in the assay on Sf9 cells, is unknown. Important features of the mammalian PMCA pumps, such as the location and spacing between the transmembrane domains, the identity of the sequence of the phosphorylation site (32James P. Zvaritch E. Shakhparonow M.I. Penniston J.T. Carafoli E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1987; 149: 7-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) and of the FITC site (33Filoteo A.G. Gorski J.P. Penniston J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 6526-6530Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) as well the presence of the C-terminal extension that accounts for the molecular mass of 130 kDa, as compared with those of a typical SERCA-type pump (34Verma A.K. Filoteo A.G. Stanford D.R. Weiben E.D. Penniston J.T. Strehler E.E. Fisher R. Heim R. Vogel G. Mathews S. Strehler-Page M.-A. James P. Vorherr T. Krebs J. Carafoli E. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 14152-14159Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), all point to the conclusion that the Mca family proteins belong to the PMCA family ATPases (Fig. 1). Whereas the overall sequence identity between mammalian and nematode proteins at the 200 C-terminal amino acids appears to be low, the most pronounced region of similarity (Fig. 4 A) corresponds to the location of the calmodulin-binding/autoinhibitory domain of the mammalian pumps (35Vorherr T. James P. Krebs J. Enyedi A. McCormick D.J. Penniston J.T. Carafoli E. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 355-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 36Vorherr T. Kessler T. Hofmann F. Carafoli E. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 22-27Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In all three nematode sequences, this region of similarity features an obvious propensity to form an amphiphilic helix, with clustering of hydrophobic residues on one side, and a variable number of basic residues on the opposite side (Fig. 4 B). In a membrane-based assay, the expressedmca-1 protein actually binds human calmodulin at a concentration of 10 nm or higher (Fig.5). This experiment clearly demonstrates the specific binding of human calmodulin to a protein, which is only present in the cells, expressing the mca-1 construct. Moreover, this protein is indeed expected to have a very similar mobility to the expressed human PMCA4. Two kinds of control samples used in this experiment sort out the interference of an endogenous streptavidin-binding protein (Fig. 5, esb), because this band is the only one remaining in the presence of EGTA (not shown).Figure 5Binding of human calmodulin to the Mca1 protein expressed in Sf9 cells. Gel-fractionated and electroblotted membrane proteins from untransfected cells (lane U), cells transfected with the mca-1 construct (lane CE), and cells transfected with the humanpmca4 construct (lane H4). Sf9 cells were incubated with 10 nm biotinylated human calmodulin and 200 μm Ca2+. The band that is visible only in the presence of Ca2+ is designated mca; the endogenous streptavidin-binding protein is designated esb. The numbers at the left show the positions of the protein marker bands. The amount of protein loaded in lane H4 was 3-fold lower than that in lanes U andCE.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Finally, whereas a calmodulin-binding domain is not necessarily identified by its sequence similarity to another one, in this case, a significant consensus sequence can be derived (Fig. 4 A), which suggests that the Mca family may actually contain orthologs of the PMCA family, particularly because at a >90% completion of the nematode genome, no other suitable candidates could be found. The genome projects have resulted in the identification of numerous proteins with a candidate function inferred from sequence similarity to known proteins and/or a genetically identified phenotype. In this work, database searches have revealed three groups of EST clones showing about a 65% similarity to mammalian calcium ATPases of the PMCA family. The location and spacing between the major sequence motifs of the mca-1 protein unequivocally place it in the PMCA family and rule out the possibility that it belongs to a SERCA-type family or to any novel Ca2+-ATPase family not found thus far in mammalian cells. In fact, a SERCA-type sequence is encoded on chromosome III (cosmid K9D11), whereas all threemca genes reside on chromosome IV. However, themca-1 gene has a number of features that are not found inpmca genes, namely, the presence of alternative splicing at the extreme N terminus, the absence of internal splicing site A found in the pmca genes, and the absence of alternative splicing around the calmodulin-binding domain, 2Unpublished data. as compared with the mammalian alternative splicing site C (37Strehler E.E.

Chem. 1993; 268: 2740-2748Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A peculiar feature ofmca-1 protein (which is not found, however, inmca-2 and mca-3) is the presence of the serine-rich region, which includes 11 consecutive residues, located between transmembrane segments 2 and 3. This region replaces the stretch of alternating lysines and glutamic acid residues responsible for phospholipid sensitivity (39Niggli V. Adunyah E.S. Carafoli E. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 8588-8592Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which is pronounced in PMCA pumps but absent in SERCA pumps. The calmodulin-stimulated mammalian PMCA family has been the subject of extensive studies during the last decade, after the cloning of the first cDNAs in the late 1980s. However, whereas single cloned PMCA isoforms could be expressed in a model system based on a cell line and some of their biochemical properties could be studied (for a review, see Ref. 3Carafoli E. Garcia Martin E. Guerini D. Experientia (Basel). 1996; 52: 1091-1100Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), the implication of their specific features at the cellular/organismal level was beyond the possibilities of the experimental system. The identification of nematode analogs of the mammalian PMCA pumps now paves the way to reverse genetic experiments on the organismal level. At the time of writing, the C. elegans genome seems to contain only three genes, showing substantial similarity to the mammalian PMCA family as well as five candidate plasma membrane Na/Ca(K) exchangers.2 Although it is not excluded that other candidate genes still reside in the gaps of the genomic data, or that they are missed in the EST data due to the toxicity of this protein or portions thereof to the Escherichia coli cell, the number and variety of candidate plasma membrane calcium transporters in the nematode approach the level of complexity known for mammalian systems.

We have used F9 embryonal carcinoma cells as a model system to study gene regulation during an early stage of murine embryogenesis. We find that transcription by RNA polymerase I decreases when F9 cells differentiate into parietal endoderm. The reduced rate of transcription is associated with a down-regulation of several components of the class I transcription apparatus. The most substantial change involves the essential factor SL1, which is a multisubunit complex that contains the TATA-binding protein and three TATA-binding protein-associated factors (TAFs). The abundance of two of these TAFs, TAFI48 and TAFI95, decreases during F9 cell differentiation. Developmental regulation of a specific class of genes may therefore be achieved through changes in the availability of TAFs.

Developmental regulation of a specific class of genes may therefore be achieved through changes in the availability of TAFs. The early stages of mouse development involve rapidly changing patterns of transcription, which play a key role in embryogenesis. These events are inaccessible to study at the biochemical level because of the difficulty in obtaining homogeneous cell populations in sufficient numbers. One way to circumvent this problem involves the use of embryonal carcinoma (EC) 1The abbreviations used are: EC, embryonal carcinoma; HPRT, hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase; PE, parietal endo- derm; pol, polymerase; TBP, TATA-binding protein; TAF, TBP-associated factor; TF, transcription factor; TIF-IB, transcription initiation factor IB; UBF, upstream binding factor; PC, phosphocellulose. cell lines, which mimic events within the early embryo. A well characterized example is the F9 EC cell line, which can be induced to differentiate into parietal endoderm (PE) by treatment with retinoic acid and cAMP (1Strickland S. Smith K.K. Marotti K.R. Cell. 1980; 21: 347-355Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (593) Google Scholar). Differentiation of F9 cells is accompanied by a dramatic decrease in the rate of transcription by RNA polymerase (pol) III (2White R.J. Stott D. Rigby P.W.J. Cell. 1989; 59: 1081-1092Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). This response appears to provide an accurate reflection of regulatory phenomena that occur in early development because in situ hybridization has demonstrated that the abundance of pol III transcripts decreases substantially when PE forms in mouse embryos (3Vasseur M. Condamine H. Duprey P. EMBO J. 1985; 4: 1749-1753Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). By using F9 cells as a model system, it has been possible to demonstrate that the decrease in pol III transcription that accompanies differentiation into PE reflects a specific decrease in the abundance of a transcription factor called TFIIIB (2White R.J. Stott D. Rigby P.W.J. Cell. 1989; 59: 1081-1092Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 4Alzuherri H.M. White R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17166-17171Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Ribosome biogenesis requires equimolar amounts of each of the rRNAs. Because 5 S rRNA is made by pol III, whereas the remaining rRNAs are made by pol I, these polymerases are frequently regulated coordinately (5Paule M.R. Transcription of Ribosomal RNA Genes by Eukaryotic RNA Polymerase I. Springer-Verlag New York Inc., New York1998Google Scholar, 6White R.J. RNA Polymerase III Transcription. 2nd Ed. Springer-Verlag New York Inc., New York1998Crossref Google Scholar). We have therefore investigated whether the decrease in pol III transcription that occurs during F9 cell differentiation is accompanied by a similar change in pol I activity. Our results indicate that PE cells contain less rRNA than F9 EC cells, and this reflects a reduced rate of transcript initiation. Changes are observed in several components of the pol I transcription machinery. PE cells display a slight decrease in the catalytic activity of the polymerase itself. They also show a slight reduction in the level of the basal factor UBF, which binds to rRNA promoters and stimulates expression by folding the DNA and excluding repressor proteins (7Kuhn A. Grummt I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 7340-7344Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 8Reeder R.H. Pikaard C.S. McStay B. Nucleic Acids Mol. Biol. 1995; 9: 251-263Crossref Google Scholar). An additional role for UBF is to interact with an essential initiation factor called SL1 or TIF-IB and stabilize its association with the promoter (5Paule M.R. Transcription of Ribosomal RNA Genes by Eukaryotic RNA Polymerase I. Springer-Verlag New York Inc., New York1998Google Scholar, 8Reeder R.H. Pikaard C.S. McStay B. Nucleic Acids Mol.

SL1/TIF-IB is a complex containing the TATA-binding protein (TBP) and three TBP-associated factors (TAFs) (5Paule M.R. Transcription of Ribosomal RNA Genes by Eukaryotic RNA Polymerase I. Springer-Verlag New York Inc., New York1998Google Scholar, 10Comai L. Tanese N. Tjian R. Cell. 1992; 68: 965-976Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). The abundance of two of these TAFs, TAFI95 and TAFI48, is significantly depressed following F9 cell differentiation. As a consequence, the activity of SL1/TIF-IB is severely limiting for pol I transcription in PE cell extracts. We conclude that the differentiation of F9 EC cells is accompanied by changes in several components of the pol I transcription machinery, which result in decreased production and steady-state levels of the large rRNA. F9 cells were cultured and differentiated as previously described (2White R.J. Stott D. Rigby P.W.J. Cell. 1989; 59: 1081-1092Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Total cellular RNA was extracted using TRI reagent (Sigma), according to the manufacturer's instructions. Agarose gel electrophoresis, Northern transfer, and hybridization were conducted as previously described (2White R.J. Stott D. Rigby P.W.J.

Cozzarelli N.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1986; 6: 3068-3076Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The primer was 5′-CAGGCACCGCGACAGACCCAAG-3′, which is complementary to bases +100 to +122 of the mouse rRNA gene. Whole cell extracts were prepared according to the method of Manley et al. (12Manley J.L. Fire A. Cano A. Sharp P.A. Gefter M.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

SL1/TIF-IB was present in this 0.6–1.2 m KCl step fraction (PC-D), which contained ∼1% of recovered protein. UBF and TFIIB were present in the 0.35–0.6 m KCl step fraction (PC-C). Heparin gradient chromatography of SL1/TIF-IB was carried out as previously described (15Learned R.M. Cordes S. Tjian R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1985; 5: 1358-1369Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Human UBF was fractionated by gradient chromatography of a HeLa nuclear extract on Q-Sepharose, performed as previously described (16Cairns C.A. White R.J. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3112-3123Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar), and it was found to elute at ∼500 mm KCl, away from the bulk of protein. HeLa UBF was also fractionated by heparin chromatography of a PC-C fraction to give the CHep1.0 fraction (13White R.J. Gottlieb T.M. Downes C.S. Jackson S.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1983-1992Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Transcription reactions were carried out as previously described (2White R.J. Stott D. Rigby P.W.J.

The pol I template was pMrWT, which contains bases −168 to +155 of the mouse rRNA promoter (17Rudloff U. Eberhard D. Tora L. Stunnenberg H. Grummt I.

Total RNA was extracted from undifferentiated F9 EC cells and from cells that had been induced to differentiate into PE by culture in the presence of retinoic acid and dibutyryl cAMP. The abundance of the 28 S rRNA product of pol I was then compared in F9 EC and PE cells by Northern blot analysis (Fig.1 A). After differentiating for 5 days (lane 2), the 28 S rRNA was found to be 2.7-fold less abundant than in undifferentiated EC cells (lane 1), and after 7 days of differentiation its level had decreased by 4.0-fold (lane 3). This effect is specific, because the steady-state level of tRNA remains unchanged, as shown previously (2White R.J. Stott D. Rigby P.W.J. Cell. 1989; 59: 1081-1092Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Large rRNA is synthesized as a 47 S precursor molecule, the 5′ end of which is degraded rapidly (22Kass S. Craig N. Sollner-Webb B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2891-2898Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Because the sequences at the start of the primary transcript are highly unstable, their level in the cell reflects the rate of ongoing initiation by pol I. Primer extension analysis with various amounts of total RNA was used to quantitate the 5′ end of the primary rRNA transcript and test whether its abundance is altered by differentiation (Fig. 1 B). PhosphorImager quantitation revealed that the level of the pre-rRNA 5′ sequences is 3–5-fold higher in EC cells relative to PE cells. We conclude that a decrease in the rate of transcript initiation can account for the reduced steady-state levels of large rRNA in differentiated PE cells. To compare the activity of the pol I transcription apparatus before and after differentiation, whole cell extracts were prepared and assayed for their ability to initiate transcription on a rRNA gene template. EC cell extracts were found to support much higher levels of pre-rRNA synthesis than extracts prepared in parallel from PE cells (Fig.2 A). This was the case with several sets of extracts that had been prepared using either of two different extraction protocols. EC cell extracts were more active than PE cell extracts when these assays were carried out over a range of protein/DNA ratios. 2H. Alzuherri and R. J. White, unpublished data. Quantitation of these experiments indicated that the activity of the pol I transcription initiation apparatus is 6–9-fold higher in EC extracts than in PE extracts. It is unclear why the EC/PE differential is greater in vitro than in vivo. As a control for the specificity of these effects, we assayed the ability of F9 cell extracts to support pol II initiation from an HPRT promoter. Previous work has demonstrated that HPRT transcription is not decreased after F9 cell differentiation (2White R.J. Stott D. Rigby P.W.J. Cell. 1989; 59: 1081-1092Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Consistent with this finding, we found that EC and PE extracts initiate transcription at the HPRT promoter with comparable efficiencies (Fig. 2 B). We conclude that the observed decrease in initiation by pol I is a specific regulatory event. The above-described results suggest that the ability of pol I to initiate transcription is greater in EC than in PE cells. To determine whether this reflects the production of an excess of dominant repressor following differentiation, we performed mixing experiments (Fig.3). Titrating increasing amounts of PE extract into a constant amount of EC cell extract did not diminish the level of transcription that was obtained using EC extract alone. This mixing approach therefore provided no evidence for a dominant repressor of pol I transcription that is present in PE extracts in stoichiometric excess. We therefore addressed the possibility that the reduced rate of rRNA synthesis following differentiation is the result of a decrease in the activity of one or more components of the pol I basal transcription apparatus. To determine whether differentiation is accompanied by a change in the catalytic capacity of pol I, we carried out random polymerization assays using poly(dA-dT) as template. EC extracts were found consistently to have slightly higher pol I catalytic activity than PE extracts that were prepared in parallel.2 However, the difference between matched pairs of extracts was only 1.6–2.2-fold. Although this change in pol I activity may contribute to the observed regulation of rRNA synthesis, it seems insufficient to account fully for the reduced levels of pol I transcription that are found in PE cell extracts. To examine whether differentiation affects the abundance of UBF, we carried out Western blots with EC and PE cell extracts (Fig.4 A). The amount of UBF was found to decrease by 1.7–3.1-fold after differentiation, with an average difference of ∼2.5-fold. Similar changes in UBF levels were also detected when EC- and PE-derived fractions were compared after chromatography.2 To examine whether there is a generalized reduction in the level of transcription factors following F9 cell differentiation, the same extracts were probed for the presence of TFIIB, and the amount of this basal pol II factor was found to remain virtually constant when the EC and PE cell extracts were compared (Fig.4 B). We also found that the abundance of the pol III factor TFIIIC2 does not decrease when F9 cells differentiate (2White R.J. Stott D. Rigby P.W.J. Cell. 1989; 59: 1081-1092Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 4Alzuherri H.M. White R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17166-17171Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). We conclude from these data that the observed reduction in the level of UBF is a specific phenomenon. If the reduced transcriptional activity of PE cell extracts is caused by a lack of UBF, it should be possible to stimulate expression by adding more UBF. However, we found that titrating in partially purified UBF made little difference to the rate of pol I transcription in PE-derived extracts (Fig. 5 A). In contrast, an SL1-containing fraction tested in parallel produced a substantial increase in the rate of rRNA synthesis. Indeed, this fraction was sufficient to raise the rate of transcription in a PE cell extract to levels obtained using EC cell extracts. These data suggest that there is a relative excess of UBF activity following F9 cell differentiation, despite its decrease in abundance. Instead, the transcription of rRNA genes appears to be limited in PE extracts by a lack of SL1/TIF-IB activity. A rather different response was obtained when EC cell extracts were tested in the same way (Fig. 5 B). Although adding the SL1/TIF-IB fraction produced a slight increase in transcription by the EC extract, the UBF fraction gave a much more dramatic stimulation (lanes 1–7). In contrast, when tested in parallel, PE extract again responded to SL1/TIF-IB but not to the UBF fraction (lanes 8–14). These results provide evidence for a shift in the balance of the pol I factors as F9 cells differentiate; the UBF fraction stimulates transcription in EC extracts but not in PE extracts, whereas the activity of SL1/TIF-IB becomes severely limiting after differentiation. We carried out complementation assays to test whether the activity of SL1/TIF-IB is diminished in PE cell extracts. The assay system exploited the fact that SL1 from humans is unable to function on a mouse rRNA promoter, whereas the other components of the human pol I transcription apparatus are fully active on a murine template (15Learned R.M. Cordes S. Tjian R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1985; 5: 1358-1369Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 17Rudloff U. Eberhard D. Tora L. Stunnenberg H. Grummt I. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2611-2616Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A HeLa cell extract is therefore unable to transcribe a mouse rRNA gene unless a source of murine SL1/TIF-IB is provided. The addition of 2 μg of EC cell extract was sufficient to allow expression from the murine promoter in this system. In contrast, 10 μg of PE cell extract was required to give a comparable signal when tested in parallel (Fig.6 A). Because the HeLa extract used in this assay provides an excess of the other pol I factors, the relative inactivity of the PE cell extract must be because of a deficiency in the species-specific factor SL1/TIF-IB. As a further test of this conclusion, we used phosphocellulose chromatography to purify this factor approximately 100-fold from EC and PE cell extracts. These fractions were then compared for their ability to reconstitute transcription from the murine promoter in the complementation assay. When we added the SL1/TIF-IB fraction from F9 EC cells, efficient transcription of the mouse gene was obtained, whereas the corresponding fraction from PE cells was significantly less active when tested in parallel (Fig. 6 B). Although 0.36 μg of the EC-derived fraction was sufficient to give a signal in this assay (lane 2), approximately four times more of the PE-derived fraction was required to cross the detection threshold (lane 7). We conclude that F9 cell differentiation is accompanied by a significant decrease in the activity of SL1/TIF-IB. Western blots were carried out to compare the abundance of each of the four components of SL1/TIF-IB in EC and PE extracts. The overall level of TBP was found to be lower following differentiation (Fig.7 A). However, previous analyses have shown that this decrease in TBP is associated primarily with the down-regulation of TFIIIB and that the TBP content of fractions containing SL1/TIF-IB and TFIID remains relatively constant (4Alzuherri H.M. White R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17166-17171Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, the abundance of TAFI48 (Fig.7 B) and TAFI95 (Fig. 7 C) was also found to be lower in the PE cell extracts than in the EC cell extracts. In contrast, the abundance of TAFI68 remains unchanged following differentiation (Fig. 7 D). Western blot analysis was also conducted on phosphocellulose fractions containing SL1/TIF-IB that had been partially purified from EC and PE cells. As in the crude extracts, the fractions showed little change in the levels of TAFI68 (Fig.8 A, upper).Furthermore the TBP content of these fractions changed little during differentiation (Fig. 8 A, lower), as reported previously (4Alzuherri H.M. White R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17166-17171Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). However, both TAFI95 (Fig. 8 B) and TAFI48 (Fig. 8 C) were much less abundant in the fraction derived from PE cells compared with the equivalent EC-derived fraction, as seen in the crude extracts. For each subunit of SL1/TIF-IB, these results were confirmed using a second antiserum raised against an alternative epitope (for TBP and TAFI95, three separate antisera were used). The results suggest strongly that F9 cell differentiation is accompanied by a specific decrease in the abundance of two TAF components of SL1/TIF-IB. The steady-state level of 28 S rRNA is significantly lower in F9 PE cells than in the undifferentiated EC progenitors. This decrease reflects a reduction in the activity of the pol I transcription apparatus and a diminished rate of transcript initiation. We have detected a down-regulation in three separate components of the basal machinery, pol I itself and the initiation factors UBF and SL1/TIF-IB. Despite the generality of these changes to the pol I apparatus, the effects are nevertheless specific, because the abundance of TFIIB and the rate of pol II initiation at the HPRT promoter show little or no difference between EC and PE cells. A previous study using rat L6 myoblasts has shown that the abundance of UBF decreases during myogenic differentiation (23Larson D.E. Xie W. Glibetic M. O'Mahony D. Sells B.H. Rothblum L.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 7933-7936Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). It may therefore be that a reduction in UBF levels is a common feature of differentiation in rodent cells. UBF is also a target for regulation during differentiation of the human monocytic cell line U937 (24Cavanaugh A.H. Hempel W.M. Taylor L.J. Rogalsky V. Todorov G. Rothblum L.I. Nature. 1995; 374: 177-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). In U937 cells, however, UBF is regulated by interaction with the retinoblastoma protein, rather than a change in abundance (24Cavanaugh A.H. Hempel W.M. Taylor L.J. Rogalsky V. Todorov G. Rothblum L.I. Nature. 1995; 374: 177-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). Genetic analysis has shown that ratinoblastoma protein is important for hematopoiesis but is not required for the early differentiation events that are mimicked by F9 cells (25Mulligan G. Jacks T. Trends Genet. 1998; 14: 223-229Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). Despite the changes in UBF, the reduced rate of pol I transcription that is found in PE cells appears to be caused primarily by a decrease in the availability of SL1/TIF-IB. UBF activity is in relative excess after differentiation, as shown by the fact that adding more UBF to PE extracts does not increase the level of expression. Instead, add-back experiments suggest that SL1/TIF-IB is the limiting component of the pol I transcription apparatus. We cannot be certain that SL1/TIF-IB is sufficient to restore active transcription to PE cell extracts, as our fractions contain traces of UBF.2 It is therefore possible that both SL1/TIF-IB and UBF are necessary to raise transcription in the PE cell extracts to levels obtained using EC cell extracts. Nevertheless, SL1/TIF-IB appears to be critical for this effect, because fractions that lack this factor but contain active UBF produce no stimulation when added to the PE cell extract. The requirement for SL1/TIF-IB in these add-back experiments is consistent with the substantial down-regulation of this factor, which is detected both in complementation assays and also by immunoblotting. Complementation assays with crude extracts or phosphocellulose fractions reproducibly show that the activity of SL1/TIF-IB decreases by 4- or 5-fold following differentiation. Despite this finding, the abundance of TAFI68 remains virtually constant, the maximal change observed being 1.2-fold. In contrast, substantial decreases are observed with TAFI95 and TAFI48. Accurate quantitation of the changes in these TAFs is difficult because of their low abundance following differentiation. When various extracts and fractions are compared, we find that the levels of TAFI95 and TAFI48 can decrease by anything from 3- to 13-fold after differentiation. It is difficult to be confident in these numbers, however, because of the very low signal obtained when Western blotting some PE cell extracts and fractions. Nevertheless, we are able to conclude that there is a specific and substantial reduction in the abundance of these subunits. SL1/TIF-IB is an essential component of the pol I machinery that is involved in promoter recognition and polymerase recruitment (5Paule M.R. Transcription of Ribosomal RNA Genes by Eukaryotic RNA Polymerase I. Springer-Verlag New York Inc., New York1998Google Scholar). Although murine SL1/TIF-IB activity has yet to be reconstituted from isolated subunits (21Heix J. Zomerdijk J.C.B.M. Ravanpay A. Tjian R. Grummt I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1733-1738Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), both TAFI48 and TAFI110 (the human equivalent of TAFI95) are essential for transcription in the human system (26Zomerdijk J.C.B.M. Beckmann H. Comai L. Tjian R. Science. 1994; 266: 2015-2018Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 27Beckmann H. Chen J.-L. O'Brien T. Tjian R. Science. 1995; 270: 1506-1509Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). It therefore seems highly probable that the decreased abundance of TAFI48 and TAFI95 in PE cells can account for the reduction in SL1/TIF-IB activity that is detected by complementation assays. To our knowledge, this constitutes the first report that SL1/TIF-IB is subject to developmental control. However, tissue-specific changes in TAFs have been described previously. Differentiated human B cells contain a TAF component of TFIID that is not found in other cell types and may contribute to B cell-specific patterns of pol II transcription (28Dikstein R. Zhou S. Tjian R. Cell. 1996; 87: 137-146Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Furthermore, a set of TAFs becomes restricted to the developing nervous system during Drosophila development (29Hansen S.K. Takada S. Jacobson R.H. Lis J.T. Tjian R. Cell. 1997; 91: 71-83Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Previous studies have also provided precedent for TAF regulation during differentiation of F9 cells. PE extracts were shown to contain substantially reduced levels of the pol III-specific TBP-containing complex TFIIIB (2White R.J. Stott D. Rigby P.W.J. Cell. 1989; 59: 1081-1092Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 4Alzuherri H.M. White R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17166-17171Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). This reflects a decrease in the abundance of a TFIIIB TAF called BRF (TFIIB-related factor) (4Alzuherri H.M. White R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17166-17171Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). As a result of this change, the rate of pol III transcription is considerably less in PE than in EC cells or extracts (2White R.J. Stott D. Rigby P.W.J. Cell. 1989; 59: 1081-1092Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 4Alzuherri H.M. White R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17166-17171Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Because the pol III product 5 S rRNA is required in equimolar ratios with the rRNAs made by pol I, it is not surprising that the two systems are regulated in parallel during F9 cell differentiation. It is interesting that this coregulation is achieved by a similar mechanism in both cases, a reduction in the availability of specific TAFs. We thank David Stott for advice concerning the growth and differentiation of F9 cells and Carol Cairns, Ingrid Grummt, Brian McStay, and Joost Zomerdijk for antibodies and discussions."
https://openalex.org/W2000514078,"Abstract In this study, we have examined the transport characteristics of the wild-type lactose permease, single mutants in which Lys-319 was changed to asparagine or alanine or Glu-325 was changed to glutamine or alanine, and the corresponding double mutant strains. The wild-type and Asn-319 mutant showed high levels of lactose uptake, with K m values of 0.42 and 1.30 mm and V max values of 102.6 and 48.3 nmol of lactose/min/mg of protein, respectively. The Asn-319/Gln-325 strain had a normal K m of 0.36 mm and a moderate V max of 18.5 nmol of lactose/min/mg of protein. By comparison, the single E325Q strain had a normal K m of 0.27 mm but a very defective V max of 1.3 nmol of lactose/min/mg of protein. A similar trend was observed among the alanine substitutions at these positions, although the V max values were lower for the Ala-319 mutations. When comparing theV max values between the single position 325 mutants with those of the double mutants, these results indicate that neutral 319 mutations substantially alleviate a defect inV max caused by neutral 325 mutations. With regard to H+/lactose coupling, the wild-type permease is normally coupled and can transport lactose against a gradient. The position 325 single mutants showed no evidence of H+transport with lactose or thiodigalactoside (TDG) and were unable to facilitate uphill lactose transport. The single Asn-319 mutant and double Asn-319/Gln-325 mutant were able to transport H+upon the addition of lactose or TDG. In addition, both of these strains catalyzed a sugar-dependent H+ leak that inhibited cell growth in the presence of TDG. These two strains were also defective in uphill transport, which may be related to their sugar-dependent leak pathway. Based on these and other results in the literature, a model is presented that describes how the interactions among several ionizable residues within the lactose permease act in a concerted manner to control H+/lactose coupling. In this model, Lys-319 and Glu-325 play a central role in governing the ability of the lactose permease to couple the transport of H+ and lactose."
https://openalex.org/W2107138368,"The translation initiation factor eIF2 consists of three subunits that are present in equal molar amounts. The genomic DNA containing the gene for eIF2β and its promoter were cloned and sequenced to characterize further the mechanism of their regulated synthesis. Whereas Southern blot analysis indicated that a number of copies of the gene may exist, only one full-length intron-containing copy was identified. Similar to the eIF2α promoter, the eIF2β promoter is TATA-less, CAAT-less, and GC-rich and contains an α-Pal binding motif. Mutation of the α-Pal binding sequence resulted in an 8-fold decrease in activity when assayed by the luciferase reporter gene constructs. The data suggest a common mechanism of transcriptional control for the two cloned subunits of eIF2.

The data suggest a common mechanism of transcriptional control for the two cloned subunits of eIF2. The translation initiation factor eIF2 catalyzes the first regulated step of protein biosynthesis, the binding of the initiator Met-tRNAi to the 40 S ribosomal subunit. Binding occurs as a ternary complex of Met-tRNAi-eIF2-GTP. All three subunits of eIF2 (α, β, γ) are required for the catalytic utilization of eIF2 during protein synthesis initiation (1Duncan R. Hershey J.W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 7228-7235Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 2Hershey J.W.B. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1991; 60: 717-755Crossref PubMed Scopus (840) Google Scholar). The α subunit of eIF2 is a 36.2-kDa polypeptide whose phosphorylation state regulates activity of the heterotrimer (3Hershey J.W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 20823-20826Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The β subunit appears to bind GTP or GDP and is a 51.9-kDa polypeptide (4Gaspar N.J. Kinzy T.G. Scherer B.J. Humbelin M. Hershey J.W.B. Merrick W.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3415-3422Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The 38.3-kDa γ subunit may be directly involved in binding of the ternary complex to mRNA (5Flynn A. Oldfield S. Proud C.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1174: 117-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar,6Pathak V.K. Nielsen P.J. Trachsel H. Hershey J.W.B. Cell. 1988; 54: 633-639Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). None of the three subunits appears to exist as a monomer outside the eIF2 heterotrimer. Initial experiments demonstrated that balanced synthesis of the α and β subunits is predominantly the result of different rates of ribosomal elongation (7Chiorini J.A. Boal T.R. Miyamoto S. Safer B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13748-13755Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Subsequent experiments suggested that eIF2α expression could be regulated by antisense transcripts that form double-stranded RNA during T-cell activation (8Noguchi M. Miyamoto S. Silverman T.A. Safer B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29161-29167Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Regulation of sense transcription is under the control of a transcription factor designated α-Pal, which binds to an unusual direct repeat element. α-Pal is homologous to the developmental transcription factors P3A2 and ewg (9Efiok B.J.S. Chiorini J.A. Safer B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18921-18930Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Potential target genes of α-Pal can be broadly classified as encoding growth-responsive factors (9Efiok B.J.S. Chiorini J.A. Safer B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18921-18930Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To see if the eIF2β subunit was regulated via similar mechanisms, the eIF2β gene and its promoter region were cloned and characterized.RESULTSA cDNA clone for eIF2β was isolated from human liver mRNA, and the encoded polypeptide was shown to interact with the eIF2α and γ subunits (6Pathak V.K. Nielsen P.J. Trachsel H. Hershey J.W.B. Cell. 1988; 54: 633-639Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Southern blots of DNA isolated from K562 cells (ATCC) probed with the eIF2β cDNA produced a large number of fragments, indicating the gene for eIF2β is either very large or there are multiple copies (Fig.1 A). Hybridization of duplicate Southern blots with either an oligonucleotide probe from the 3′-UTR (bases 1273–1298) or a random-primed fragment from the 5′-UTR (1–103) generated a simplified pattern of only 4 or 5 bands (Fig. 1,B and C, respectively). These results suggest the existence of multiple genomic fragments with a high degree of homology to the eIF2β cDNA. Because of the high degree of specificity of oligonucleotide probes compared with random-primed fragments, the 3′-UTR oligonucleotide probe was initially used to screen a human fibroblast genomic library.Genomic clones corresponding to three of the four bands detected using the 3′-UTR oligonucleotide probe were isolated after screening multiple libraries (Fig. 2). Although all three exhibited a high degree of homology to the cDNA, only one was nearly identical and contained introns. This clone is referred to as clone 1A (Fig. 2). Additional sequencing and restriction mapping showed that clone 1A contained an insert 13 kilobases in length and 550 bases of the cDNA divided into 5 exons. A full-length clone was obtained by using polymerase chain reaction to amplify the DNA between the last exon in clone 1A and upstream exons. The promoter region and initiation codon were cloned by creating subgenomic libraries of the five DNA fragments that hybridized to the 5′ 103 base pairs of the cDNA as shown in Fig. 1 C. From the subgenomic library constructed from the 2.3-kilobase fragments, one clone was isolated that contained the missing cDNA sequence and could be linked to clone 1A. This produced a full-length cDNA and is referred to as clone 1 (Fig. 2). In addition, another pseudogene was isolated from this library, which contained the whole open reading frame with a number of point mutations but lacked introns. This clone is referred to as clone 4 (Fig.2).Figure 2cDNA maps. Sequenced regions of the eIF2β genes are depicted below the published cDNA. Thearrows indicate the beginning and the end of the coding region of the cDNA. The dots above the linesindicate the regions of sequence divergence from the published cDNA sequence.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)The sequence of clone 1 differed from the published cDNA in two respects. The 5′ most 18 bases reported to be in the cDNA were not present in the 2.3-kilobase promoter fragment. Clone 1 also differed from the cDNA at position 1000. The cDNA contained a T at this position and the genomic clone contained a C. This difference could be the result of a mutation introduced by reverse transcriptase during the cloning of the eIF2β cDNA or it could indicate that more than one copy of the β gene exists. To distinguish between these two possibilities, three identical Northern blots were prepared and probed with complementary oligonucleotide probes that contained the genomic version of this sequence based on clone 1 (5′-AGAGTCTGTCCTTC), the cDNA version of the sequence (5′-AGAGTCGTATGTCCTTC), or a unique sequence found in one of the pseudogenes, clone 2 (5′-TCACATGAAACTATTAAGTAAGC). Under stringent washing conditions each oligonucleotide probe hybridized to the plasmid from which its sequence was obtained (Fig. 3). Although the cDNA and clone 1 oligonucleotide probes differed by a single nucleotide, no cross-hybridization was observed in the other plasmid. When these same hybridization conditions were used to probe Northern blots, only the oligonucleotide from clone 1 hybridized to a message on the Northern blots (Fig. 4 B). The mRNAs detected by the clone 1 oligonucleotide probe are of similar mobility to those detected by hybridization with the full-length cDNA (Fig. 4 D). Therefore clone 1A would appear to contain the correct sequence. Because the oligonucleotide probe based on the published cDNA sequence did not hybridize to the Northern blot (Fig. 4 A), the T at position 1000 may be an artifact introduced during the cloning process of the cDNA.Figure 3Oligonucleotide hybridization conditions. Complementary oligonucleotide probes corresponding to the divergent region in the coding region of the cDNA (991–1008) and the corresponding sequence in clone 1 and clone 2 were synthesized and used to probe three panels of DNA dot blots. Each panel contained a dot of 100 ng or 10 ng of DNA of the cDNA clone 1 or clone 2 as indicated to the left of the figure. The oligonucleotide probe used to probe the panel is indicated at the top of the figure. Under stringent washing conditions, the oligonucleotide probes would only hybridize to their corresponding target DNA.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Figure 4Northern blot analysis. Similar hybridization and washing conditions to those used in Fig. 3 were used to hybridize and wash three Northern blots. The oligonucleotide probe used as a probe on the blot is indicated above the blot. A, cDNA oligonucleotide probe; B, clone 1 oligonucleotide probe; C, clone 2 oligonucleotide probe. Within each blotlane 1 contains 10 μg of K562 total RNA; lane 2, 0.250 μg of poly(A+) K562 RNA; lane 3, 10 μg of mouse total RNA (CLONTECH); lane 4, 0.250 μg of mouse poly(A+) RNA (CLONTECH). A eIF2β message was only detected with the probe derived from clone 1. No signal above background was detected with the other two probes. D, as a size control an additional Northern blot was probed with a random-primed probe of the entire cDNA. Lanes 1–3 contain 5, 10, and 20 μg of K562 total RNA, respectively.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)To define the sequence at the 5′ end of the message, total K562 RNA was hybridized with radiolabeled antisense riboprobes derived from either the 5′ end of the cDNA or clone 1 and analyzed in a RPA. As a size control, the antisense riboprobes were also hybridized with a non-radiolabeled sense fragment transcribed from the original eIF2β cDNA. Fig. 5 A (lane 3) shows that incubation of the radiolabeled cDNA probe with the cDNA sense control gave a band that was the correct length for a fully protected cDNA fragment. As a point of reference the length of this band is defined as 1 (Fig. 5, A and B). Incubation of the cDNA sense control message with the clone 1 riboprobe produced a band 18 bases shorter that corresponds to the point of divergence for the cDNA sequence and the genomic sequence. The length of this band is correspondingly −18 (Fig. 5, A,lane 11, and B). Incubation of the cDNA probe with total K562 RNA also produced bands of approximately 18 bases shorter than the cDNA/cDNA hybrid, indicating that the 5′-terminal 18 bases contained in the cDNA are not present in the pool of K562 RNA (Fig. 5 A, lanes 4–6). Hybridization of the clone 1 riboprobe with total K562 RNA generated bands approximately 21 bases longer than the cDNA, indicating that the genomic sequence of clone 1 was again correct and that the 5′-UTR was longer than previously reported (Fig. 5 A, lanes 13–15). Because the cDNA was isolated from a library derived from liver mRNA (6Pathak V.K. Nielsen P.J. Trachsel H. Hershey J.W.B. Cell. 1988; 54: 633-639Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), this difference could be tissue-specific. However, hybridization with liver RNA with each probe generated bands of similar size to the K562 RNA (Fig. 5 A, lanes 7–9, 16–18).Figure 5A ribonuclease protection assay. Total RNA from either K562 cells or mouse liver was hybridized with antisense riboprobes from the 5′-UTR of either the cDNA or clone 1 and digested with RNase at a 1:50 (lanes 2–4, 7,11–13, 16) and 1:25 dilution (lanes 5, 6, 8, 9, 14, 15, 17, 18) with either 50 μg of total RNA (lanes 4, 5, 7, 8, 13, 14, 16, 17) or 100 μg of total RNA (lanes 6, 9, 15, 18). As controls the two riboprobes were each hybridized with yeast tRNA (lanes 2, 12) or in vitro transcribed sense RNA from the cDNA (lanes 3, 11). The undigested probe was loaded in lanes 1 and10. The numbers to the left of the figure correspond to the relative map position based on the hybridization of the cDNA riboprobe to the in vitrotranscribed sense cDNA RNA (lane 3). The other map positions were determined by comparison with a sequencing ladder.B, schematic of RPA. The relative lengths of the bands generated by the RPA are compared and indicated above the figure. The length of the band produced by hybridizing the cDNA riboprobe within vitro transcript RNA from the cDNA clone is set at 1. The columns to the right of the figure indicate which probe was used and the corresponding RNA target to which it was hybridized.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)To more accurately map the start site of the mRNA, total RNA from K562 cells was hybridized with a radiolabeled antisense primer binding 87 bases from the 5′ end of the cDNA. The primer was extended with reverse transcriptase, and a series of bands was detected by autoradiography (Fig. 6, lane 1). This pattern was simplified by the addition of actinomycin D (Fig. 6, lane 2), and a single prominent band of 108 bases was produced, indicating the 5′ end of the message was 21 bases upstream from the 5′ end of the cDNA clone. This length is in agreement with the potential start site identified by the RPA analysis.Figure 6Primer extension analysis of eIF2β mRNA in K562 cells. Total RNA from K562 cells was isolated and annealed with a 5′ end-labeled non-coding strand primer that hybridizes to bases 70–87 of the cDNA. This primer was extended with reverse transcriptase (M-MLV); the resulting product was isolated and resolved on a denaturing polyacrylamide gel as described under “Materials and Methods.” The size of the fragment was determined by comparing the resulting bands to a sequencing ladder (lanes labeled G,A, T, C). The extension reaction was carried out in the absence (lane 1) or the presence (lane 2) of actinomycin D (50 μg/ml).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Therefore, of the four possible eIF2β genes that were identified by Southern blotting only one contained the entire cDNA and introns. The organization of this gene is shown in Fig.7 A. The gene for eIF2β spans 28 kilobases and is divided into 9 exons ranging in size from 50 to 480 bases. The message appears to be transcribed from a single start site 138 bases upstream of the initiation codon and contains a 3′-UTR of 280 bases. The number of nucleotides contained in each exon is summarized in Fig. 7 B, columns 1 and 2.Figure 7Genomic map. A, the exon portions of the eIF2β gene are depicted as boxes. Restriction endonuclease recognition sites are indicated: R, EcoRI; H, HindIII; X, XbaI; P, PstI. The numbersbelow correspond to the exon number. B, exon structure and minigene divergences. Column 2 of the table lists the nucleotides of the cDNA contained in each exon (column 1). The numbering is based on the published cDNA (6Pathak V.K. Nielsen P.J. Trachsel H. Hershey J.W.B. Cell. 1988; 54: 633-639Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar).Column 3 lists the amino acid changes in the minigene (clone 4) compared with the corrected cDNA (clone 1).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Further sequencing of clone 4 showed it contains several point mutations and an in frame deletion of 18 bases (amino acids 138–143) (Fig. 7 B, column 3). In vitrotranscription and translation of clone 4 generated a protein product very similar in size to that translated from the cDNA (data not shown). Several attempts were made to identify a transcript for this gene in vivo using Northern blots, RPA of K562, and activated lymphocyte RNA, but none could be detected (data not shown).The promoter region of eIF2β (−1000 to +1321) was searched for transcriptional elements and was found to contain a number of potential transcription factor binding sites (Fig.8). The eIF2β promoter contains a consensus sequence for the α-Pal transcription factor at −25. This element is also present in the promoter of the α subunit of eIF2 (9Efiok B.J.S. Chiorini J.A. Safer B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18921-18930Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Positioned over the cap site is a potential Sp1 site with potential E2F, C/EBP, c-myc, and two SIF sites located downstream at +15, +22, +253, +93, and +106, respectively. Upstream of the cap site, potential p53, Ap2, myoD, F-Act1, and CAAT box motifs exist.Figure 8Promoter sequence. The sequence of the eIF2β promoter region (−1000 to +200) is presented. Anarrow indicates the start site of transcription as mapped by both primer extension and ribonuclease protection experiments, and the initiation codon is italic and boxed. The α-Pal transcription factor binding site is underlined. Other potential transcription factor binding sites are identified byboxes. The 5′-UTR sequence identified in clone 1, which was missing from the published cDNA, is indicated inbold.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Previous research has demonstrated the importance of the α-Pal site in the regulation of the eIF2 promoter (1Duncan R. Hershey J.W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 7228-7235Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To assess the importance of the α-Pal element in the expression of the eIF2β gene, luciferase reporter constructs were made that contained mutations in the α-Pal region of the promoter. The α-Pal sequence was mutated from TGCGCAGGCGCAto TGCAAATTGGAT, which had previously been shown not to bind the α-Pal transcription factor (7Chiorini J.A. Boal T.R. Miyamoto S. Safer B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13748-13755Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This mutation decreased promoter function in the reporter constructs 8-fold compared with the wild type promoter (Fig.9, A and B,column 2 versus 3). A similar change in activity was detected in transfection of both 3T3 and 293 cells. To detect possible antisense activity, the promoter region was cloned into the luciferase plasmid in the antisense orientation and transfected into 293 cells or 3T3 cells. No luciferase activity was detected using a region corresponding to the first intron (+125 to +1300) alone in the sense or antisense orientation (Fig. 9, columns 4 and 5, respectively). Furthermore, no luciferase activity was detected using the entire promoter region (−1000 to +1300) in the antisense orientation (Fig. 9, column 6). Experiments using reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction of RNA isolated from Go and activated T-cells also failed to detect any antisense RNA transcription within the first intron region of eIF2, which has been described for eIF2 (8Noguchi M. Miyamoto S. Silverman T.A. Safer B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29161-29167Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (data not shown).Figure 9Luciferase reporter analysis.

One mechanism for achieving coordinate regulation is through the use of a common regulatory transcription factor. Examples of this theme are the CREB family of responsive genes and the NF-κB family. The presence of a functional α-Pal site in the two subunits of eIF2 that have been cloned indicates that α-Pal may also act as a coordinating factor.Obtaining the genomic clone for eIF2β was much more complicated than for eIF2α. Multiple pseudogenes were identified for the eIF2β subunit as well as an intronless minigene. In contrast, eIF2α was encoded by a single gene (12Humbelin M. Safer B. Chiorini J.A. Hershey J.W.B. Cohen R. DNA (N. Y.). 1989; 81: 315-324Google Scholar). Furthermore, several differences were identified in the genomic clone compared with the cDNA. Through the use of high stringency Northern blots and RPAs, the genomic clone was shown to be the correct sequence, and no mRNA corresponding to the cDNA sequences could be detected. The differences in the 5′-UTR and those at base 1000 in the published cDNA compared with the genomic sequence are most likely the result of ligation artifacts produced during the creation of the libraries and poor fidelity of reverse transcriptase, respectively.The minigene identified during the cloning may be the result of a retrotransposition event. Although in vitro translation of this open reading frame generated a protein that was very similar in size to that generated from the cDNA, no transcript for this gene could be detected in vivo by Northern blot analysis, RPA in K562, or T-cells. Other bands are present on Northern blots probed with the eIF2β cDNA, and these mRNAs are most likely the result of multiple polyadenylation sites as has been reported for other translation factors (12Humbelin M. Safer B. Chiorini J.A. Hershey J.W.B. Cohen R. DNA (N. Y.). 1989; 81: 315-324Google Scholar). Although it would appear that only one functional gene for eIF2β exists, multiple functional copies of other translation factors have been identified (13Nielsen P.J. McMaster G.K. Trachsel H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1985; 13: 6867-6880Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Recently two genomic clones were isolated for eIF4E; one contained introns and the other was intronless (14Gao M. Rychlik W. Rhoads R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4622-4628Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar).Whereas eIF2α and eIF2β are regulated at the transcriptional level by α-Pal, the cis elements in the two promoters are distinct. The eIF2α subunit promoter has two adjacent sites, which bind α-Pal with different affinities. Mutation of the high affinity site decreases expression 12-fold, whereas mutation of the lower affinity site inhibits expression 3-fold. 2J. A. Chiorini, S. Miyamoto, S. J. Harkin, and B. Safer, unpublished data. In contrast, eIF2β has only a single site whose deletion results in an 8-fold reduction in transcriptional activity. However, both genes are TATA-less and have the α-Pal sites positioned in the traditional −30 TATA box site. Although potential α-Pal binding sites have been identified in a number of other genes (9Efiok B.J.S. Chiorini J.A. Safer B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18921-18930Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), their importance has yet to be demonstrated. Characterization of α-Pal binding sites identified in these other growth-responsive genes is essential to defining the role of α-Pal as a coordinating transcription factor involved in the regulation of expression of growth response genes. The translation initiation factor eIF2 catalyzes the first regulated step of protein biosynthesis, the binding of the initiator Met-tRNAi to the 40 S ribosomal subunit. Binding occurs as a ternary complex of Met-tRNAi-eIF2-GTP. All three subunits of eIF2 (α, β, γ) are required for the catalytic utilization of eIF2 during protein synthesis initiation (1Duncan R. Hershey J.W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 7228-7235Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 2Hershey J.W.B. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1991; 60: 717-755Crossref PubMed Scopus (840) Google Scholar). The α subunit of eIF2 is a 36.2-kDa polypeptide whose phosphorylation state regulates activity of the heterotrimer (3Hershey J.W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 20823-20826Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The β subunit appears to bind GTP or GDP and is a 51.9-kDa polypeptide (4Gaspar N.J. Kinzy T.G. Scherer B.J. Humbelin M. Hershey J.W.B. Merrick W.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3415-3422Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The 38.3-kDa γ subunit may be directly involved in binding of the ternary complex to mRNA (5Flynn A. Oldfield S. Proud C.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1174: 117-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar,6Pathak V.K. Nielsen P.J. Trachsel H. Hershey J.W.B. Cell. 1988; 54: 633-639Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). None of the three subunits appears to exist as a monomer outside the eIF2 heterotrimer. Initial experiments demonstrated that balanced synthesis of the α and β subunits is predominantly the result of different rates of ribosomal elongation (7Chiorini J.A. Boal T.R. Miyamoto S. Safer B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13748-13755Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Subsequent experiments suggested that eIF2α expression could be regulated by antisense transcripts that form double-stranded RNA during T-cell activation (8Noguchi M. Miyamoto S. Silverman T.A. Safer B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29161-29167Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Regulation of sense transcription is under the control of a transcription factor designated α-Pal, which binds to an unusual direct repeat element. α-Pal is homologous to the developmental transcription factors P3A2 and ewg (9Efiok B.J.S. Chiorini J.A. Safer B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18921-18930Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Potential target genes of α-Pal can be broadly classified as encoding growth-responsive factors (9Efiok B.J.S. Chiorini J.A. Safer B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18921-18930Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To see if the eIF2β subunit was regulated via similar mechanisms, the eIF2β gene and its promoter region were cloned and characterized. RESULTSA cDNA clone for eIF2β was isolated from human liver mRNA, and the encoded polypeptide was shown to interact with the eIF2α and γ subunits (6Pathak V.K. Nielsen P.J. Trachsel H. Hershey J.W.B. Cell. 1988; 54: 633-639Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Southern blots of DNA isolated from K562 cells (ATCC) probed with the eIF2β cDNA produced a large number of fragments, indicating the gene for eIF2β is either very large or there are multiple copies (Fig.1 A). Hybridization of duplicate Southern blots with either an oligonucleotide probe from the 3′-UTR (bases 1273–1298) or a random-primed fragment from the 5′-UTR (1–103) generated a simplified pattern of only 4 or 5 bands (Fig. 1,B and C, respectively). These results suggest the existence of multiple genomic fragments with a high degree of homology to the eIF2β cDNA. Because of the high degree of specificity of oligonucleotide probes compared with random-primed fragments, the 3′-UTR oligonucleotide probe was initially used to screen a human fibroblast genomic library.Genomic clones corresponding to three of the four bands detected using the 3′-UTR oligonucleotide probe were isolated after screening multiple libraries (Fig. 2). Although all three exhibited a high degree of homology to the cDNA, only one was nearly identical and contained introns. This clone is referred to as clone 1A (Fig. 2). Additional sequencing and restriction mapping showed that clone 1A contained an insert 13 kilobases in length and 550 bases of the cDNA divided into 5 exons. A full-length clone was obtained by using polymerase chain reaction to amplify the DNA between the last exon in clone 1A and upstream exons. The promoter region and initiation codon were cloned by creating subgenomic libraries of the five DNA fragments that hybridized to the 5′ 103 base pairs of the cDNA as shown in Fig. 1 C. From the subgenomic library constructed from the 2.3-kilobase fragments, one clone was isolated that contained the missing cDNA sequence and could be linked to clone 1A. This produced a full-length cDNA and is referred to as clone 1 (Fig. 2). In addition, another pseudogene was isolated from this library, which contained the whole open reading frame with a number of point mutations but lacked introns. This clone is referred to as clone 4 (Fig.2).The sequence of clone 1 differed from the published cDNA in two respects. The 5′ most 18 bases reported to be in the cDNA were not present in the 2.3-kilobase promoter fragment. Clone 1 also differed from the cDNA at position 1000. The cDNA contained a T at this position and the genomic clone contained a C. This difference could be the result of a mutation introduced by reverse transcriptase during the cloning of the eIF2β cDNA or it could indicate that more than one copy of the β gene exists.
