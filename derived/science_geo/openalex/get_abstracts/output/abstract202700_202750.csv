https://openalex.org/W2077381884,The concentration of trehalose in the blood of Phormia regina was found to determine the rate of energy expenditure during flight as reflected in measurements of the wing-beat frequency. Fat body was found to be the source of blood trehalose; either endogenous or exogenous substrates are used for its synthesis.

https://openalex.org/W2061759279,A wide variation in chromosome number and morphology was observed among different species and subspecies of lemurine lemurs. Comparative karyotype analysis indicates close phylogenic relationships and strongly suggests that chromosome structural rearrangements may have played an important role in the evolution of this group of primates.

https://openalex.org/W2028703626,"A technique is described for self-infusion of pharmacologic agents in solution through a permanently indwelling jugular catheter in the rhesus monkey. The results of an experiment utilizing this technique demonstrate that an instrumental lever response can be conditioned, extinguished, reconditioned, and brought under stimulus control and reward-schedule control with saline self-infusion as the reinforcing stimulus."

https://openalex.org/W2062551161,"IT seems well established that the first steps in the biosynthesis of proteins are the activation of amino-acids in the presence of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and the transfer of the activated amino-acids to a soluble fraction of ribonucleic acid (RNA)1. Such reactions are also involved in the biosynthesis of some peptides, for example, the condensation of glutamyl-cysteine with glycine to give glutathione2. Enzymes activating almost all the naturally occurring L-amino-acids have been isolated from animal, plant, and microbial sources. Only one enzyme active on a D-amino acid, D-alanine, has been demonstrated in cells of Lactobacillus arabinosus and other Lacto-bacillaceae3."

While the highest levels detected are less than 0.2 percent of the maximum permissible concentration, the movement of this neutron-induced radionuclide is of interest, and the baseline information is important for future studies."

https://openalex.org/W1982730438,"THE presence of leptospirosis in Pennsylvania cattle has been well established1–3. An epizootiological investigation to determine the relationship between bovine and sylvan leptospirosis is at present being undertaken in south-eastern Pennsylvania. Infected cattle herds are identified and their premises intensively trapped for wild-life. Trapped animals are examined for infection by serological and cultural techniques. Isolations of leptospires have been made from the following animals : woodchuck4, opossum, skunk, racoon and Norwegian rat. This communication is believed to be the first to report the isolation of Leptospira pomona from an eastern red fox (Vulpes fulva fulva)5. The fox was trapped on the premises of a known infected cattle herd. Prior to the start of trapping, Leptospira pomona had been isolated from cattle and from surface waters on this farm."
https://openalex.org/W1992093938,"INDIAN zebu cattle differ from the cattle of the temperate regions in having a marked hump and voluminous dewlap and navel flap. These structures are specially well developed in areas with very oppressive summer heat, and it has been suggested that these special structures may be related to the animal's greater thermoregulatory power."

It was decided, therefore, to look for evidence of genetic exchange in Klebsiella pneumoniae, and between this organism and others of the Enterobacteriaceae."

The deficiency begins prior to hibernation, progresses during hibernation, and, in males, continues during the immediate postemergence period."
https://openalex.org/W2039634044,"ONE of the most satisfactory methods of paper chromatography of alkaloids is the butanol–citrate system introduced by Curry and Powell1. It suffers, however, from the disadvantage that if one attempts to elute the alkaloid with chloroform for subsequent confirmatory tests, a certain amount of citrate is also extracted. This interferes with certain important colour tests, as the yellow colour which it gives with concentrated sulphuric acid modifies any colour given by the alkaloid. For example, morphine with the Marquis reagent gives a muddy brown instead of a clear violet."
