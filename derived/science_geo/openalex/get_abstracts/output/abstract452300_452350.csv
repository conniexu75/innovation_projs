The prevailing dogma has focused on aboveground plant litter as a principal source of soil organic matter. Using (14)C bomb-carbon modeling, we show that 50 to 70% of stored carbon in a chronosequence of boreal forested islands derives from roots and root-associated microorganisms. Fungal biomarkers indicate impaired degradation and preservation of fungal residues in late successional forests. Furthermore, 454 pyrosequencing of molecular barcodes, in conjunction with stable isotope analyses, highlights root-associated fungi as important regulators of ecosystem carbon dynamics. Our results suggest an alternative mechanism for the accumulation of organic matter in boreal forests during succession in the long-term absence of disturbance."
https://openalex.org/W2020173141,"Nucleosome remodelers of the DDM1/Lsh family are required for DNA methylation of transposable elements, but the reason for this is unknown. How DDM1 interacts with other methylation pathways, such as small-RNA-directed DNA methylation (RdDM), which is thought to mediate plant asymmetric methylation through DRM enzymes, is also unclear. Here, we show that most asymmetric methylation is facilitated by DDM1 and mediated by the methyltransferase CMT2 separately from RdDM. We find that heterochromatic sequences preferentially require DDM1 for DNA methylation and that this preference depends on linker histone H1. RdDM is instead inhibited by heterochromatin and absolutely requires the nucleosome remodeler DRD1. Together, DDM1 and RdDM mediate nearly all transposon methylation and collaborate to repress transposition and regulate the methylation and expression of genes. Our results indicate that DDM1 provides DNA methyltransferases access to H1-containing heterochromatin to allow stable silencing of transposable elements in cooperation with the RdDM pathway."

The antidiabetic drug metformin disrupts bacterial folate and methionine cycles This effect in C. elegans microbiota increases lifespan via methionine restriction Metformin increases lifespan only if microbiota are present and is otherwise toxic Microbiota may mediate metformin effects on mammalian health and aging Metformin is the world’s most widely prescribed drug, as an oral antihyperglycemic agent for type 2 diabetes (T2D) and in the treatment of metabolic syndrome. However, the real and potential benefits of metformin therapy go beyond its prescribed usage, including reduced risk of cancer (Dowling et al., 2011Dowling R.J. Goodwin P.J. Stambolic V. Understanding the benefit of metformin use in cancer treatment.BMC Med. 2011; 9: 33Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar) and, in animal models, delayed aging, an effect seen in rodents (Anisimov et al., 2011Anisimov V.N. Berstein L.M. Popovich I.G. Zabezhinski M.A. Egormin P.A. Piskunova T.S. Semenchenko A.V. Tyndyk M.L. Yurova M.N. Kovalenko I.G. Poroshina T.E. If started early in life, metformin treatment increases lifespan and postpones tumors in female SHR mice.Aging (Albany NY). 2011; 3: 148-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar) and in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans (Onken and Driscoll, 2010Onken B. Driscoll M. Metformin induces a dietary restriction-like state and the oxidative stress response to extend C. elegans Healthspan via AMPK, LKB1, and SKN-1.PLoS ONE. 2010; 5: e8758Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar). The mechanisms underlying these positive effects remain unclear. One possibility is that metformin recapitulates the effects of dietary restriction (DR), the controlled reduction of food intake that can improve late-life health and increases lifespan in organisms ranging from nematodes and fruit flies to rodents and rhesus monkeys (Mair and Dillin, 2008Mair W. Dillin A. Aging and survival: the genetics of lifespan extension by dietary restriction.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2008; 77: 727-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar). In mammals, the action of metformin is partly mediated by AMPK activation, which results in downregulation of TOR and the IGF-1/AKT pathways to reduce energy-consuming processes (Pierotti et al., 2012Pierotti M.A. Berrino F. Gariboldi M. Melani C. Mogavero A. Negri T. Pasanisi P. Pilotti S.

An unexplored possibility is that metformin alters mammalian physiology via its effects on gut microbiota (Bytzer et al., 2001Bytzer P. Talley N.J. Jones M.P. Horowitz M. Oral hypoglycaemic drugs and gastrointestinal symptoms in diabetes mellitus.Aliment. Pharmacol. Ther. 2001; 15: 137-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The gut microbiome (or microbiota) plays a major role in the effects of nutrition on host metabolic status (Nicholson et al., 2012Nicholson J.K. Holmes E. Kinross J. Burcelin R. Gibson G. Jia W. Pettersson S. Host-gut microbiota metabolic interactions.Science. 2012; 336: 1262-1267Crossref PubMed Scopus (2913) Google Scholar), as well as contributing to metabolic disorders such as obesity, diabetes, metabolic syndrome, autoimmune disorders, inflammatory bowel disease, liver disease, and cancer (Delzenne and Cani, 2011Delzenne N.M. Cani P.D. Gut microbiota and the pathogenesis of insulin resistance.Curr. Diab. Rep. 2011; 11: 154-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar; Kau et al., 2011Kau A.L. Ahern P.P. Griffin N.W.

Holmes E. Kinross J. Burcelin R. Gibson G. Jia W. Pettersson S. Host-gut microbiota metabolic interactions.Science. 2012; 336: 1262-1267Crossref PubMed Scopus (2913) Google Scholar). It may also influence the aging process (Ottaviani et al., 2011Ottaviani E. Ventura N. Mandrioli M. Candela M. Franchini A. Franceschi C. Gut microbiota as a candidate for lifespan extension: an ecological/evolutionary perspective targeted on living organisms as metaorganisms.Biogerontology. 2011; 12: 599-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). It has been argued that the host and its symbiotic microbiome acting in association (holobiont) should be considered as a unit of selection in evolution (Zilber-Rosenberg and Rosenberg, 2008Zilber-Rosenberg I. Rosenberg E. Role of microorganisms in the evolution of animals and plants: the hologenome theory of evolution.FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 2008; 32: 723-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (930) Google Scholar). Coevolution of microbiota facilitates host adaptation by enabling e.g., nutrient acquisition, vitamin synthesis, xenobiotic detoxification, immunomodulation, and gastrointestinal maturation. In return, the host provides a sheltered incubator with nutrients (Bäckhed et al., 2005Bäckhed F. Ley R.E. Sonnenburg J.L. Peterson D.A. Gordon J.I. Host-bacterial mutualism in the human intestine.Science. 2005; 307: 1915-1920Crossref PubMed Scopus (3635) Google Scholar). Thus, the two components of the holobiont are symbiotic, but microbiota can also be commensal or pathogenic. Defining interactions between drug therapy, microbiome and host physiology is experimentally challenging given the complex and heterogeneous nature of mammalian gut microbiota. Here simple animal models amenable to genetic manipulation can be helpful. For example, in the fruit fly Drosophila, microbiota modulates host development and metabolic homeostasis via the TOR pathway (Storelli et al., 2011Storelli G. Defaye A. Erkosar B. Hols P. Royet J. Leulier F. Lactobacillus plantarum promotes Drosophila systemic growth by modulating hormonal signals through TOR-dependent nutrient sensing.Cell Metab. 2011; 14: 403-414Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar). C. elegans is particularly convenient for such studies because under standard culture conditions only a single microbe is present (as a food source): the human gut bacterium Escherichia coli (Brenner, 1974Brenner S. The genetics of Caenorhabditis elegans.Genetics. 1974; 77: 71-94Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Active bacterial metabolism is a critical nutritional requirement for C. elegans, the absence of which retards development and extends lifespan (Lenaerts et al., 2008Lenaerts I. Walker G.A. Van Hoorebeke L. Gems D. Vanfleteren J.R. Dietary restriction of Caenorhabditis elegans by axenic culture reflects nutritional requirement for constituents provided by metabolically active microbes.J. Gerontol. A Biol. Sci. Med. Sci. 2008; 63: 242-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Moreover, worms are sometimes long-lived on mutant E. coli with metabolic defects (Saiki et al., 2008Saiki R. Lunceford A.L. Bixler T. Dang P. Lee W. Furukawa S. Larsen P.L. Clarke C.F. Altered bacterial metabolism, not coenzyme Q content, is responsible for the lifespan extension in Caenorhabditis elegans fed an Escherichia coli diet lacking coenzyme Q.Aging Cell. 2008; 7: 291-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar; Virk et al., 2012Virk B. Correia G. Dixon D.P. Feyst I. Jia J. Oberleitner N. Briggs Z. Hodge E. Edwards R. Ward J. et al.Excessive folate synthesis limits lifespan in the C. elegans: E. coli aging model.BMC Biol. 2012; 10: 67Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) and on microbial species thought to enhance human health, e.g., from the genera Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium (Ikeda et al., 2007Ikeda T. Yasui C. Hoshino K. Arikawa K. Nishikawa Y. Influence of lactic acid bacteria on longevity of Caenorhabditis elegans and host defense against salmonella enterica serovar enteritidis.Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2007; 73: 6404-6409Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). These observations suggest that E. coli plays a more active role in C. elegans nutrition and metabolism than as a mere food source, and in some respects acts as microbiota (Lenaerts et al., 2008Lenaerts I. Walker G.A. Van Hoorebeke L. Gems D. Vanfleteren J.R. Dietary restriction of Caenorhabditis elegans by axenic culture reflects nutritional requirement for constituents provided by metabolically active microbes.J. Gerontol. A Biol. Sci. Med. Sci. 2008; 63: 242-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). C. elegans has also been used extensively to identify genes that specify endocrine, metabolic, and dietary regulation of aging (Kenyon, 2010Kenyon C.J. The genetics of ageing.Nature. 2010; 464: 504-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (1996) Google Scholar). In this study, we examine the mechanism by which metformin extends lifespan in C. elegans. We report that its effects are mediated by the cocultured E. coli, where metformin inhibits bacterial folate and methionine metabolism. This, in turn, leads to altered methionine metabolism in the worm, and increased lifespan. These findings reveal how drug action on host-microbiome interactions can impact health and longevity. We first verified the effects on worm lifespan of metformin, and also the more potent biguanide drug phenformin. Metformin at 25, 50, and 100 mM increased mean lifespan by 18%, 36%, and 3% (Figure 1A; Table S1 available online). Phenformin at 1.5, 3, and 4.5 mM also increased lifespan, by 5%, 21%, and 26% (Figure 1B; Table S1). As expected, maximal effects on lifespan of these pharmacologically similar drugs were nonadditive (Figure 1C; Table S1). Metformin reduced the exponential age increase in mortality rate (Figure 1D), demonstrating that it slows aging (at least until day 18) rather than reducing risk of death. Metformin also modestly increased mean lifespan when administered from middle age onward, but only at 25 mM (+8%, p < 0.001; Figure 1E; Table S1). In most trials, the DNA replication inhibitor FUdR was used to prevent progeny production, but effects of metformin on lifespan are not FUdR-dependent (Figures S1F and S1G; Table S1) (Onken and Driscoll, 2010Onken B. Driscoll M. Metformin induces a dietary restriction-like state and the oxidative stress response to extend C. elegans Healthspan via AMPK, LKB1, and SKN-1.PLoS ONE. 2010; 5: e8758Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar). These results confirm the robust effects of biguanide drugs on aging in C. elegans.Figure S1Effects of Biguanides on Fecundity, Growth, and Lifespan, Related to Figure 1Show full caption(A) Dose-dependent reduction in daily fecundity by phenformin.(B) Effect of phenformin on daily fecundity as a proportion of total fecundity.

Interventions altering E. coli can affect C. elegans lifespan (Garigan et al., 2002Garigan D. Hsu A.L. Fraser A.G. Kamath R.S. Ahringer J. Kenyon C.

Altered bacterial metabolism, not coenzyme Q content, is responsible for the lifespan extension in Caenorhabditis elegans fed an Escherichia coli diet lacking coenzyme Q.Aging Cell. 2008; 7: 291-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). To test the possibility that metformin increases worm lifespan by altering the E. coli, we assessed its effects in the absence of bacteria (axenic culture). As expected, culture on axenic medium (Lenaerts et al., 2008Lenaerts I. Walker G.A. Van Hoorebeke L. Gems D. Vanfleteren J.R. Dietary restriction of Caenorhabditis elegans by axenic culture reflects nutritional requirement for constituents provided by metabolically active microbes.J. Gerontol. A Biol. Sci. Med. Sci. 2008; 63: 242-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) and bacterial deprivation (Kaeberlein et al., 2006Kaeberlein T.L. Smith E.D. Tsuchiya M. Welton K.L. Thomas J.H. Fields S. Kennedy B.K. Kaeberlein M. Lifespan extension in Caenorhabditis elegans by complete removal of food.Aging Cell. 2006; 5: 487-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar) caused an increase in worm lifespan, typical of DR. Under these conditions, metformin did not increase worm lifespan, but instead markedly reduced it (Figures 2A, S2A, and S2B; Table S2). UV-irradiation of E. coli impairs bacterial viability and extends worm lifespan without reducing fertility, suggesting a mechanism distinct from DR (Gems and Riddle, 2000Gems D. Riddle D.L. Genetic, behavioral and environmental determinants of male longevity in Caenorhabditis elegans.Genetics. 2000; 154: 1597-1610PubMed Google Scholar). Under these conditions, metformin still shortened lifespan (−16%, p < 0.001; Figure 2B; Table S2). Next, we raised E. coli in the presence of metformin and then transferred it to drug-free agar plates. Drug pretreatment of E. coli robustly extended worm lifespan (+33%, p < 0.001; Figure 2C; Table S2). We conclude that the life-extending effect of metformin is mediated by live E. coli. Moreover, in the absence of E. coli, metformin shortens C. elegans lifespan, likely reflecting drug toxicity. One possibility is that metformin extends worm lifespan by reducing E. coli pathogenicity. Proliferating E. coli block the alimentary canal in older worms, and antibiotic treatment can both prevent this proliferation and increase worm lifespan (Garigan et al., 2002Garigan D. Hsu A.L. Fraser A.G. Kamath R.S. Ahringer J. Kenyon C. Genetic analysis of tissue aging in Caenorhabditis elegans: a role for heat-shock factor and bacterial proliferation.Genetics. 2002; 161: 1101-1112Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To determine whether metformin extends worm lifespan by preventing E. coli proliferation, we tested its effects in the presence of carbenicillin. This antibiotic is bacteriostatic, blocking bacterial proliferation without greatly reducing its viability. Metformin increased lifespan to a similar degree in the absence (+25%) or presence (+24%) of carbenicillin (p < 0.001; Figure 2D; Table S2). Thus, metformin does not increase lifespan by preventing bacterial proliferation. Culture of C. elegans with Bacillus subtilis increases lifespan (Garsin et al., 2003Garsin D.A. Villanueva J.M. Begun J. Kim D.H. Sifri C.D. Calderwood S.B. Ruvkun G. Ausubel F.M. Long-lived C. elegans daf-2 mutants are resistant to bacterial pathogens.Science. 2003; 300: 1921Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar), suggesting that this microbe is less pathogenic to C. elegans than E. coli. Metformin increased lifespan of worms cultured on B. subtilis (+9%, p < 0.001; Figure 2E; Table S2). These findings suggest that reduced bacterial pathogenicity is not the cause of metformin-induced longevity. Biguanides induced a dose-dependent inhibition of E. coli proliferation (Figures 2F and S2C) and an alteration in bacterial lawn morphology (Figure 2G). Similar results were obtained with B. subtilis (Figures S2D–S2F). Thus, metformin can also act as an antibiotic. Notably, the drug concentration thresholds for bacterial and worm lifespan effects were similar, and also pH-dependent (Figures S2G and S2H and Table S2). We then asked if the antibiotic effects of metformin were bacteriocidal or bacteriostatic. When subcultured from metformin plates, E. coli showed no reduction in colony forming units (Figure 2H), implying that metformin has bacteriostatic rather than bacteriocidal effects. To probe whether metformin acts via one of the major, known antibiotic mechanisms, we employed the R26 P-group plasmid that confers resistance to carbenicillin, neomycin, kanamycin, tetracycline, streptomycin, gentamicin, mercuric ions, and sulfonamides. However, metformin still extended lifespan in worms on R26-transformed E. coli (39%, p < 0.001; Figure 2I and Table S2). What is the property of E. coli whose alteration by metformin increases worm lifespan? Coenzyme Q (ubiquinone) deficiency in E. coli increases C. elegans lifespan due to impairment of bacterial respiration (Saiki et al., 2008Saiki R. Lunceford A.L. Bixler T. Dang P. Lee W. Furukawa S. Larsen P.L. Clarke C.F. Altered bacterial metabolism, not coenzyme Q content, is responsible for the lifespan extension in Caenorhabditis elegans fed an Escherichia coli diet lacking coenzyme Q.Aging Cell. 2008; 7: 291-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). We therefore tested whether metformin can increase lifespan of worms on Q-deficient ubiG mutant E. coli and found that it does (+20%, p < 0.001; Figure 3A). We then tested whether metformin reduces respiration rate in E. coli OP50. Although metformin transiently reduced respiration rate, long-term exposure increased it (Figure 3B). Taken together, these findings suggest that metformin’s effect on worm lifespan is not caused by inhibition of bacterial respiration. Lipopolysaccharides (LPS) are the major component of the outer wall of Gram-negative bacteria. The structure of E. coli LPS can affect C. elegans lifespan (Maier et al., 2010Maier W. Adilov B. Regenass M. Alcedo J. A neuromedin U receptor acts with the sensory system to modulate food type-dependent effects on C. elegans lifespan.PLoS Biol. 2010; 8: e1000376Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). To test whether metformin action is dependent upon E. coli LPS type, we looked at worm lifespan on seven E. coli strains with a variety of LPS structures. Although effects of metformin on worm lifespan differed between E. coli strains (Figures 3A–3E and S3A and Table S3), this variation did not correlate with the E. coli LPS type. Interestingly, among E. coli strains there was a strong positive correlation between the capacity of metformin to increase worm lifespan and to inhibit bacterial growth (R2 = 0.82, p < 0.0007; Figure 3F). There was no correlation between bacterial metformin sensitivity and effect on worm lifespan in the absence of metformin (R2 = 9.6 × 10−5, p = 0.98; Figure S3B). This suggests that the capacity of the drug to extend worm lifespan is a function of the microbial sensitivity to growth inhibition by metformin. To test this directly, we isolated a metformin-resistant OP50 derivative (OP50-MR) (Figures 3G and S3C–S3E) that proved to contain eight mutations (see Extended Experimental Procedures). As predicted, on this strain 50 mM metformin shortened worm lifespan (−37%, p < 0.001; Figure 3H). We conclude that in metformin-resistant E. coli strains, life-shortening toxic effects predominate. However, inhibition of bacterial proliferation per se is not the cause of worm life extension, as already shown (Figure 2D; Table S2). It was recently discovered that C. elegans live longer on an E. coli mutant with reduced folate levels (aroD) (Virk et al., 2012Virk B. Correia G. Dixon D.P. Feyst I. Jia J. Oberleitner N. Briggs Z. Hodge E. Edwards R. Ward J. et al.Excessive folate synthesis limits lifespan in the C. elegans: E. coli aging model.BMC Biol. 2012; 10: 67Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Moreover, metformin can decrease folate levels in patients (Sahin et al., 2007Sahin M. Tutuncu N.B. Ertugrul D. Tanaci N. Guvener N.D. Effects of metformin or rosiglitazone on serum concentrations of homocysteine, folate, and vitamin B12 in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.J. Diabetes Complications. 2007; 21: 118-123Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). We therefore asked whether metformin increases worm lifespan by altering bacterial folate metabolism. Folates are B-group vitamins whose structure incorporates a pteridine ring, p-aminobenzoic acid (pABA), and glutamic acid(s). Folates are typically present as the reduced forms, dihydrofolate (DHF) and tetrahydrofolate (THF). THF can be substituted with a variety of one-carbon units (including formyl and methyl groups) that function as a coenzyme in metabolic reactions involving transfer of one-carbon moieties (Figure 4A). These are involved in the biosynthesis of purines and pyrimidines, in amino acid interconversions, and for the provision of methyl groups in methylation reactions (Kwon et al., 2008Kwon Y.K. Lu W. Melamud E. Khanam N. Bognar A. Rabinowitz J.D. A domino effect in antifolate drug action in Escherichia coli.Nat. Chem. Biol. 2008; 4: 602-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Metformin markedly changed the folate composition in OP50 (Figure 4B), as detected by LC-MS/MS. It increased levels of 5-methyl-THF (+116%, p = 2.5 × 10−6), 5,10-methylene-THF (+99%, p = 5.9 × 10−6), and DHF (+38%, p = 7.1 × 10−4), whereas levels of the remaining folates were decreased. It also increased folate polyglutamylation, particularly n = 6 and 7 glutamates (Figures 4C, S4A, and S4B; Table S4). Folate polyglutamylation increases their retention in the cell, and bioavailability for reactions involving folate-dependent enzymes (Kwon et al., 2008Kwon Y.K. Lu W. Melamud E. Khanam N. Bognar A. Rabinowitz J.D. A domino effect in antifolate drug action in Escherichia coli.Nat. Chem. Biol. 2008; 4: 602-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). By contrast, in the resistant strain OP50-MR, metformin did not affect polyglutamylation (Figures 4C and S4C), or DHF levels. 5-Methyl-THF and 5,10-methylene-THF were still increased (Figure 4B), but by only 29% (p = 0.018) and 17% (p = 0.003). Genome sequencing of OP50-MR revealed a mutation in glyA, which encodes a folate cycle enzyme. To explore whether metformin effects on bacterial folate metabolism affect worm lifespan, we used the antibiotic trimethoprim (TRI) that inhibits dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR). TRI (0.2, 0.5, and 1 μg/ml) increased lifespan by 16%, 30%, and 38%, respectively (p < 0.001) (Figure 4D). By contrast, in the presence of 50 mM metformin, 0.2 μg/ml TRI caused only a slight increase in lifespan (+8%, p < 0.001), whereas at higher concentrations it either had no effect (0.5 μg/ml TRI, −2%, p = 0.17) or reduced lifespan (1 μg/ml TRI, −19%, p < 0.001; Figure 4E). Such nonadditivity was recapitulated in the lack of effect of metformin on metabolic profiles of OP50 when cotreated with 1 μg/ml TRI (Figures 4F and S4E). These nonadditive effects of metformin and TRI imply a shared mechanism of action, suggesting that altered bacterial folate metabolism by metformin increases worm lifespan. To explore whether metformin-induced alterations in microbial folate metabolism increase host lifespan by altering worm folate metabolism, we first examined worm folate profiles under standard culture conditions (agar plates with E. coli OP50). In worms, as in humans, 5-methyl-THF was the predominant folate (59%) and treatment with metformin did not alter the ratio of different folate forms (Figure 5A). However, it did decrease glutamate chain length (n = 1–3) (Figures 5B and S5; Table S5), suggesting a possible change in the activity of folate-dependent enzymes.Figure S5Folate Polyglutamylation Profiles of Detectable Folate Metabolites of Wild-Type Worms Grown in the Presence or Absence of Metformin, Related to Figure 5Show full captionError bars, SEM of at least 3 independent biological replicates. ∗p < 0.05; ∗∗p < 0.01; ∗∗∗p < 0.001.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Error bars, SEM of at least 3 independent biological replicates. ∗p < 0.05; ∗∗p < 0.01; ∗∗∗p < 0.001. Thus, disruption of microbial folate metabolism increases host lifespan but with little effect on host folate levels. One possibility is that products of other E. coli folate-associated pathways influence C. elegans lifespan. Inhibition of bacterial methionine synthase (MS) causes 5-methyl-THF accumulation via the “methyl trap” mechanism, so-called because of the irreversible conversion of 5,10-methylene-THF to 5-methyl-THF (Mato et al., 2008Mato J.M. Martínez-Chantar M.L. Lu S.C. Methionine metabolism and liver disease.Annu. Rev. Nutr. 2008; 28: 273-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar) (Figure 4A). Consistent with MS inhibition, metformin not only strongly increased 5-methyl-THF levels but also reduced levels of THF (−14%, p = 0.003) (Figure 4B). Metformin also impaired the bacterial methionine cycle, causing an 86% increase in S-adenosylmethionine (SAMe) levels (p = 0.0032) and a 33% increase of S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH) (p = 0.055; Figures 4A and 5C), consistent with the lack of homocysteine (Hcy) remethylation if MS is inhibited. SAMe, the major corepressor of genes encoding enzymes of methionine biosynthesis, also inhibits the folate cycle and reduces methionine production by blocking methylene-THF reductase (MTHFR) (Banerjee and Matthews, 1990Banerjee R.V. Matthews R.G. Cobalamin-dependent methionine synthase.FASEB J. 1990; 4: 1450-1459Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar) (Figure 4A). Thus, the accumulation of the substrates SAMe, SAH, 5-methyl-THF, and 5,10-methylene-THF, and reduction of the product THF imply that metformin also reduces microbial methionine availability. This suggests that metformin might increase lifespan by reducing levels of bacterial-derived methionine in the host. To explore this, we employed a C. elegans MS mutant, metr-1(ok521), which cannot synthesize methionine and is therefore wholly dependent upon exogenous m"
https://openalex.org/W2026480865,"Glioblastomas (GBMs) are highly vascular and lethal brain tumors that display cellular hierarchies containing self-renewing tumorigenic glioma stem cells (GSCs). Because GSCs often reside in perivascular niches and may undergo mesenchymal differentiation, we interrogated GSC potential to generate vascular pericytes. Here, we show that GSCs give rise to pericytes to support vessel function and tumor growth. In vivo cell lineage tracing with constitutive and lineage-specific fluorescent reporters demonstrated that GSCs generate the majority of vascular pericytes. Selective elimination of GSC-derived pericytes disrupts the neovasculature and potently inhibits tumor growth. Analysis of human GBM specimens showed that most pericytes are derived from neoplastic cells. GSCs are recruited toward endothelial cells via the SDF-1/CXCR4 axis and are induced to become pericytes predominantly by transforming growth factor β. Thus, GSCs contribute to vascular pericytes that may actively remodel perivascular niches. Therapeutic targeting of GSC-derived pericytes may effectively block tumor progression and improve antiangiogenic therapy."
https://openalex.org/W1992932809,"Meristems encompass stem/progenitor cells that sustain postembryonic growth of all plant organs. How meristems are activated and sustained by nutrient signalling remains enigmatic in photosynthetic plants. Combining chemical manipulations and chemical genetics at the photoautotrophic transition checkpoint, we reveal that shoot photosynthesis-derived glucose drives target-of-rapamycin (TOR) signalling relays through glycolysis and mitochondrial bioenergetics to control root meristem activation, which is decoupled from direct glucose sensing, growth-hormone signalling and stem-cell maintenance. Surprisingly, glucose-TOR signalling dictates transcriptional reprogramming of remarkable gene sets involved in central and secondary metabolism, cell cycle, transcription, signalling, transport and protein folding. Systems, cellular and genetic analyses uncover TOR phosphorylation of E2Fa transcription factor for an unconventional activation of S-phase genes, and glucose-signalling defects in e2fa root meristems. Our findings establish pivotal roles of glucose-TOR signalling in unprecedented transcriptional networks wiring central metabolism and biosynthesis for energy and biomass production, and integrating localized stem/progenitor-cell proliferation through inter-organ nutrient coordination to control developmental transition and growth."
https://openalex.org/W2028776321,"Animal viruses are broadly categorized structurally by the presence or absence of an envelope composed of a lipid-bilayer membrane, attributes that profoundly affect stability, transmission and immune recognition. Among those lacking an envelope, the Picornaviridae are a large and diverse family of positive-strand RNA viruses that includes hepatitis A virus (HAV), an ancient human pathogen that remains a common cause of enterically transmitted hepatitis. HAV infects in a stealth-like manner and replicates efficiently in the liver. Virus-specific antibodies appear only after 3-4 weeks of infection, and typically herald its resolution. Although unexplained mechanistically, both anti-HAV antibody and inactivated whole-virus vaccines prevent disease when administered as late as 2 weeks after exposure, when virus replication is well established in the liver. Here we show that HAV released from cells is cloaked in host-derived membranes, thereby protecting the virion from antibody-mediated neutralization. These enveloped viruses ('eHAV') resemble exosomes, small vesicles that are increasingly recognized to be important in intercellular communications. They are fully infectious, sensitive to extraction with chloroform, and circulate in the blood of infected humans. Their biogenesis is dependent on host proteins associated with endosomal-sorting complexes required for transport (ESCRT), namely VPS4B and ALIX. Whereas the hijacking of membranes by HAV facilitates escape from neutralizing antibodies and probably promotes virus spread within the liver, anti-capsid antibodies restrict replication after infection with eHAV, suggesting a possible explanation for prophylaxis after exposure. Membrane hijacking by HAV blurs the classic distinction between 'enveloped' and 'non-enveloped' viruses and has broad implications for mechanisms of viral egress from infected cells as well as host immune responses."
https://openalex.org/W2011732001,"Oxidation of functioning copper has restricted its applicability as a catalyst for commercially important epoxidation of propylene to form propylene oxide. Here, we report that steady-state selectivity in propylene epoxidation on copper (Cu) nanoparticles increases sharply when the catalyst is illuminated with visible light. The selectivity increase is accompanied by light-induced reduction of the surface Cu atoms, which is brought about by photoexcitation of the localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) of Cu. We discuss multiple mechanisms by which Cu LSPR weakens the Cu-O bonds, reducing Cu2O."
https://openalex.org/W1980449730,The direct β-activation of saturated aldehydes and ketones has long been an elusive transformation. We found that photoredox catalysis in combination with organocatalysis can lead to the transient generation of 5π-electron β-enaminyl radicals from ketones and aldehydes that rapidly couple with cyano-substituted aryl rings at the carbonyl β-position. This mode of activation is suitable for a broad range of carbonyl β-functionalization reactions and is amenable to enantioselective catalysis.
https://openalex.org/W2134803208,"Broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs) to HIV-1 can prevent infection and are therefore of great importance for HIV-1 vaccine design. Notably, bNAbs are highly somatically mutated and generated by a fraction of HIV-1-infected individuals several years after infection. Antibodies typically accumulate mutations in the complementarity determining region (CDR) loops, which usually contact the antigen. The CDR loops are scaffolded by canonical framework regions (FWRs) that are both resistant to and less tolerant of mutations. Here, we report that in contrast to most antibodies, including those with limited HIV-1 neutralizing activity, most bNAbs require somatic mutations in their FWRs. Structural and functional analyses reveal that somatic mutations in FWR residues enhance breadth and potency by providing increased flexibility and/or direct antigen contact. Thus, in bNAbs, FWRs play an essential role beyond scaffolding the CDR loops and their unusual contribution to potency and breadth should be considered in HIV-1 vaccine design.

However, why so many mutations appear to be required is not known. Wu and Kabat first divided antibody variable regions into complementarity determining regions (CDRs) and framework regions (FWRs) based on the number of somatic hypermutations in these regions (Wu and Kabat, 1970Wu T.T. Kabat E.A. An analysis of the sequences of the variable regions of Bence Jones proteins and myeloma light chains and their implications for antibody complementarity.J. Exp. Med. 1970; 132: 211-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (934) Google Scholar) (Figures 1A and 1B ). The CDRs consist primarily of loops that form the sites of contact between the antibody and antigen (Amzel and Poljak, 1979Amzel L.M. Poljak R.J. Three-dimensional structure of immunoglobulins.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1979; 48: 961-997Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and account for the specificities of most antibody molecules as demonstrated by CDR grafting experiments (Jones et al., 1986Jones P.T. Dear P.H. Foote J. Neuberger M.S. Winter G. Replacing the complementarity-determining regions in a human antibody with those from a mouse.Nature. 1986; 321: 522-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (1128) Google Scholar). The structural integrity of the variable domains is maintained by the FWRs, which encode nine antiparallel β strands arranged into two β sheets (one sheet containing strands A, B, E, and D and the other containing strands C,” C’, C, F and G; Figures 1A and 1B). The relatively invariant β strands of the FWRs serve as a scaffold for three CDR loops, which connect strands B and C, C’ and C,” and F and G (Figures 1A and 1B) (Amzel and Poljak, 1979Amzel L.M. Poljak R.J. Three-dimensional structure of immunoglobulins.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1979; 48: 961-997Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Somatic mutations are preferentially found in the CDR loops where they can alter the antibody combining site without affecting the overall structure of the variable domain (Wu and Kabat, 1970Wu T.T. Kabat E.A. An analysis of the sequences of the variable regions of Bence Jones proteins and myeloma light chains and their implications for antibody complementarity.J. Exp. Med. 1970; 132: 211-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (934) Google Scholar). Mutations in the FWR are usually poorly tolerated and generally biased to neutral substitutions to avoid changes that would destroy the structural underpinnings of the variable domain (Reynaud et al., 1995Reynaud C.A. Garcia C. Hein W.R. Weill J.C. Hypermutation generating the sheep immunoglobulin repertoire is an antigen-independent process.Cell. 1995; 80: 115-125Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar; Wagner et al., 1995Wagner S.D. Milstein C. Neuberger M.S. Codon bias targets mutation.Nature. 1995; 376: 732Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Here we examine the role of somatic mutations in the development of broadly neutralizing anti-HIV-1 antibodies. In contrast to most other antibodies, including anti-HIV-1 antibodies with limited neutralization activity, we found that FWR mutations, including noncontact residues, are essential for the neutralizing activity of most potent bNAbs. We propose that the requirement to alter the FWR, without destroying its essential structural elements, accounts for the high mutation load found in broadly neutralizing anti-HIV-1 antibodies and possibly for the difficulty and prolonged latency with which such antibodies develop. To examine the role of somatic hypermutations in anti-HIV-1 antibody neutralization breadth and potency, we selected a group of 9 HIV-1-reactive antibodies with activity limited to easy to neutralize (Tier 1) HIV-1 strains (Seaman et al., 2010Seaman M.S.

Antibodies with limited neutralizing activity differ from bNAbs in that they generally carry fewer somatic mutations (Figures 1C and S1 and Table S1). We used the well-accepted Kabat system (Wu and Kabat, 1970Wu T.T. Kabat E.A.

Complete reversion of somatic mutations in the heavy and light chain V genes (FWR1-3 and CDR1/2) drastically reduces anti-HIV-1 antibody binding and neutralization activity (Buchacher et al., 1994Buchacher A.

Moreover, reverting only the CDR1 and CDR2 in 3BNC60 and NIH45-46 strongly diminished binding and neutralization (Figure S2A and Data S1A). To determine the functional consequences of FWR mutations, we reverted the framework residues to their germline counterparts (FWR-GL) in each of the 26 selected antibodies (Data S1B–1D) and evaluated binding to the HIV-1 envelope protein as well as their neutralization activities. As expected, reversion of somatic mutations in the FWR residues (FWR-GL) of the HIV-1 antibodies with limited breadth had only minimal effects on binding of most of these antibodies to gp140YU2 (Figure S2B) as measured by ELISA and confirmed by surface plasmon resonance (SPR) (data not shown). Only two of these FWR-GL antibodies (9-913 and 10-188) showed a decrease in binding (Figure S2B). In agreement with the ELISA and SPR experiments, we found little or no change in neutralizing activity in most of the FWR-GL antibodies with limited neutralization activity on a panel of up to six Tier 1 viruses representing clades A, B, and C (Figure S2B and Table S2). Only antibodies 9-913 and 10-188, which displayed decreased binding to gp140YU2, showed a decrease (9-913) or complete loss (10-188) in neutralizing activity (Figure S2B and Table S2). We conclude that with two exceptions out of nine antibodies tested, FWR mutations do not alter the binding or neutralizing activity of anti-HIV-1 antibodies with limited neutralizing activity. Thus, despite their significantly higher levels of somatic mutation, HIV-1-neutralizing antibodies with limited breadth resemble previously characterized antibodies to other antigens in that FWR mutations seem not to be essential. In contrast, reversion of the FWR mutations in most of the 17 broadly neutralizing antibodies decreased their binding to gp140YU2 (Figures 2 and 3). Thr"

Lignin is a major cell wall modification that often forms intricate subcellular patterns that are central to cellular function. Yet the mechanisms of lignin polymerization and the subcellular precision of its formation remain enigmatic. Here, we show that the Casparian strip, a lignin-based, paracellular diffusion barrier in plants, forms as a precise, median ring by the concerted action of a specific, localized NADPH oxidase, brought into proximity of localized peroxidases through the action of Casparian strip domain proteins (CASPs). Our findings in Arabidopsis provide a simple mechanistic model of how plant cells regulate lignin formation with subcellular precision. We speculate that scaffolding of NADPH oxidases to the downstream targets of the reactive oxygen species (ROS) that they produce might be a widespread mechanism to ensure specificity and subcellular precision of ROS action within the extracellular matrix.

A specific NADPH oxidase is crucial for formation of lignified Casparian strips NADPH oxidase specificity depends on subcellular localization and regulatory domain CASPs recruit secreted peroxidases to the Casparian strip domain The assembly of NADPH oxidase and peroxidases drives localized lignin formation Localized deposition and modification of extracellular matrix are crucial for the correct development and function of multicellular organisms. In animals, the many-faceted roles of the extracellular matrix include providing cues for cellular migration, cell layer communication, or even controlling the spread and activity of morphogenic signals (Kim et al., 2011Kim S.H. Turnbull J. Guimond S. Extracellular matrix and cell signalling: the dynamic cooperation of integrin, proteoglycan and growth factor receptor.J. Endocrinol. 2011; 209: 139-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (795) Google Scholar). Consequently, deregulation of matrix function can be intimately associated with tumor development. In plants, the highly turgescent cells undergo localized loosening, strengthening, or modification of the cell wall to drive morphogenesis of individual cells, as well as controlling the integrity of entire cell layers and organs (Cosgrove, 2005Cosgrove D.J. Growth of the plant cell wall.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2005; 6: 850-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (2262) Google Scholar). Dramatic examples of highly localized loosening of cell walls are found in tip growing root hair cells and pollen tubes (Foreman et al., 2003Foreman J. Demidchik V. Bothwell J.H. Mylona P. Miedema H.

Just as dramatic is the contact signal-dependent rupture of the pollen cell wall upon encounter of the female embryo sac and the explosive release of the sperm cells (Boisson-Dernier et al., 2009Boisson-Dernier A.

Biol. 2009; 19: 1327-1331Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). The stomatal pores that regulate gas exchange across the leaf epidermis display a precisely localized separation of certain cell wall regions and thickening of others, both of which are crucial for the functionality of these pores (Bergmann and Sack, 2007Bergmann D.C. Sack F.D. Stomatal development.Annu. Rev. Plant Biol. 2007; 58: 163-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). Xylem vessels result from an apoptotic program that leaves behind a strongly thickened but intricately structured set of interconnected hollow tubes that mediate nutrient and water flow within the plant (Oda and Fukuda, 2012bOda Y. Fukuda H. Secondary cell wall patterning during xylem differentiation.Curr. Opin. Plant Biol. 2012; 15: 38-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Plant cells detect and respond to cell wall manipulations by pathogens with rapid deposition of altered and strengthened cell walls at sites of infection (Hématy et al., 2009Hématy K. Cherk C. Somerville S. Host-pathogen warfare at the plant cell wall.Curr. Opin. Plant Biol. 2009; 12: 406-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). In all these examples, we are only beginning to identify the underlying molecular factors, and we are largely ignorant about how localized modifications of cell walls can be achieved. Lignin deposition is a major cell wall modification that plants employ in many different cell types and in response to various environmental stresses. Added to the fundamental importance of lignin is a biotechnological incentive to manipulate lignin formation, as it remains a major obstacle for the utilization of cellulosic biofuels (Vanholme et al., 2010Vanholme R. Van Acker R. Boerjan W. Potential of Arabidopsis systems biology to advance the biofuel field.Trends Biotechnol. 2010; 28: 543-547Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Lignin formation has been studied extensively as part of xylem differentiation. However, the intricate subcellular patterns observed in this system are rather a result of the prior formation of localized secondary cellulosic walls (Oda and Fukuda, 2012aOda Y. Fukuda H. Initiation of cell wall pattern by a Rho- and microtubule-driven symmetry breaking.Science. 2012; 337: 1333-1336Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar, Oda and Fukuda, 2012bOda Y. Fukuda H. Secondary cell wall patterning during xylem differentiation.Curr. Opin. Plant Biol. 2012; 15: 38-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The formation of lignin per se was recently shown to be postapoptotic in differentiating xylem vessels. It is unclear to which degree polymerization of lignin itself is spatially controlled in these cells (Pesquet et al., 2010Pesquet E. Korolev A.V. Calder G. Lloyd C.W. The microtubule-associated protein AtMAP70-5 regulates secondary wall patterning in arabidopsis wood cells.Curr. Biol. 2010; 20: 744-749Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar) and which factors would locally initiate or restrict lignin polymerization. Understanding localized lignin formation is also hindered by the many uncertainties concerning the general mechanisms of lignin polymerization in vivo (Liu, 2012Liu C.J. Deciphering the enigma of lignification: precursor transport, oxidation, and the topochemistry of lignin assembly.Mol. Plant. 2012; 5: 304-317Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). While it is well established that peroxidases and laccases catalyze oxidative coupling of monolignols in vitro, evidence for their role in planta has been more difficult to obtain. Recently, a laccase double mutant in Arabidopsis was shown to have significantly lower lignin content, providing in vivo evidence for laccases in lignin formation (Berthet et al., 2011Berthet S. Demont-Caulet N. Pollet B. Bidzinski P. Cézard L. Le Bris P. Borrega N. Hervé J. Blondet E. Balzergue S. et al.Disruption of LACCASE4 and 17 results in tissue-specific alterations to lignification of Arabidopsis thaliana stems.Plant Cell. 2011; 23: 1124-1137Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar). In the case of peroxidases, a high degree of genetic redundancy seems to have precluded identification of similarly strong lignin phenotypes, and current evidence is restricted to a number of RNA interference approaches that reported variable effects on lignin content (Fagerstedt et al., 2010Fagerstedt K.V. Kukkola E.M. Koistinen V.V.T. Takahashi J. Marjamaa K. Cell wall lignin is polymerised by class III secretable plant peroxidases in Norway spruce.J. Integr. Plant Biol. 2010; 52: 186-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar; Liu, 2012Liu C.J. Deciphering the enigma of lignification: precursor transport, oxidation, and the topochemistry of lignin assembly.Mol. Plant. 2012; 5: 304-317Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). The source of hydrogen peroxide that would be required for peroxidase activity has also remained an open question. Plasma membrane localized NADPH oxidases have been implicated in production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) during lignification, but this has been entirely based on inhibitor studies, and no specific NADPH oxidase (called Respiratory burst oxidase homologs, RBOHs, in plants) has been shown to provide ROS for lignin formation (Barcelo, 1998Barcelo A.R. The generation of H2O2 in the xylem of Zinnia elegans is mediated by an NADPH-oxidase-like enzyme.Planta. 1998; 207: 207-216Crossref Scopus (115) Google Scholar; Kärkönen and Koutaniemi, 2010Kärkönen A. Koutaniemi S. Lignin biosynthesis studies in plant tissue cultures.J. Integr. Plant Biol. 2010; 52: 176-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Recently, it has been demonstrated in Arabidopsis that Casparian strips in endodermal cells are lignin-based structures (Naseer et al., 2012Naseer S. Lee Y. Lapierre C. Franke R. Nawrath C. Geldner N. Casparian strip diffusion barrier in Arabidopsis is made of a lignin polymer without suberin.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2012; 109: 10101-10106Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). Casparian strips represent highly localized modifications of the primary cell walls that surround individual cells in a median position and confer paracellular (apoplastic) barrier properties to endodermal cells. The endodermis is a fundamental cell layer in the roots of vascular plants, which resembles polarized epithelia of animals, both in structure and function (Alassimone et al., 2010Alassimone J. Naseer S. Geldner N. A developmental framework for endodermal differentiation and polarity.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2010; 107: 5214-5219Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar; Roppolo et al., 2011Roppolo D. De Rybel B. Tendon V.D. Pfister A. Alassimone J. Vermeer J.E. Yamazaki M. Stierhof Y.D. Beeckman T. Geldner N. A novel protein family mediates Casparian strip formation in the endodermis.Nature. 2011; 473: 380-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). A family of small transmembrane proteins has been identified, which predict the localized formation of Casparian strips and are necessary for its correct formation (Roppolo et al., 2011Roppolo D. De Rybel B. Tendon V.D. Pfister A. Alassimone J. Vermeer J.E. Yamazaki M. Stierhof Y.D. Beeckman T. Geldner N. A novel protein family mediates Casparian strip formation in the endodermis.Nature. 2011; 473: 380-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). These Casparian strip domain proteins (CASPs) were proposed to form an extensive, transmembrane polymeric platform and were speculated to guide the assembly and activity of lignin biosynthetic enzymes. Here, we demonstrate that CASP1 is a determinant for the subcellular localization of a specific endodermal peroxidase. In addition, we reveal that mutations in one of the NADPH oxidase family members of Arabidopsis strongly delays formation of Casparian strips. This NADPH oxidase is recruited into the Casparian strip domain, and we show that a combination of specific N-terminal regulatory domain and subcellular localization determines its nonredundant activity. Based on our data, we can draw a model whereby subcellular precision of lignin polymerization is achieved by the combinatorial action of a locally restricted production of ROS substrate and localized peroxidase activity, brought together by the scaffolding activity of CASPs. In order to identify factors involved in Casparian strip formation, we undertook a forward genetic screen for mutants with an impaired endodermal barrier. We identified 11 mutants out of an EMS population of more than 20,000 lines (J.A., unpublished data). Six of these lines formed the single largest complementation group. We were able to rapidly determine the identity of this schengen4 (sgn4) complementation group, due to its phenotypic similarity with a T-DNA insertion line in the Respiratory burst oxidase homolog F (RBOHF) gene, investigated as part of a parallel, reverse genetic approach in our group. The mutants were termed “Schengen” after the treaty that established a borderless area between European member states. Noncomplementation with the rbohf T-DNA allele and identification of either stop or missense mutation in the RBOHF sequence of all six alleles demonstrated that SGN4 is identical to RBOHF (Figure 1A; Tables S1 and S2 available online). sgn4/rbohf mutants show a very strong delay in the formation of an apoplastic diffusion barrier, as visualized by the penetration of externally applied propidium iodide (PI) into the stele, a convenient assay for presence of a functional endodermal diffusion barrier (Alassimone et al., 2010Alassimone J. Naseer S. Geldner N. A developmental framework for endodermal differentiation and polarity.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2010; 107: 5214-5219Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar; Naseer et al., 2012Naseer S. Lee Y. Lapierre C. Franke R. Nawrath C. Geldner N. Casparian strip diffusion barrier in Arabidopsis is made of a lignin polymer without suberin.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2012; 109: 10101-10106Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar) (Figure 1B). The defective barrier is due to a complete absence of the Casparian strip in younger root parts, visualized by its autofluorescence after clearing (Figure 1C). Eventually, aberrantly structured Casparian strips form in older parts of the root, which eventually will succeed in effectively blocking penetration of PI into the stele. A similarly strong delay in the block of PI uptake (block at 36.3 ± 0.5 cells) can be observed in a casp1 casp3 double mutant (P.S. Hosmani, T. Kamiya, J. Danku, S. Naseer, N.G., M.L. Guerinot, and D.E. Salt, unpublished data). In this case, however, an aberrant, patchy Casparian strip-like structure is formed (Roppolo et al., 2011Roppolo D. De Rybel B. Tendon V.D. Pfister A. Alassimone J. Vermeer J.E. Yamazaki M. Stierhof Y.D. Beeckman T. Geldner N. A novel protein family mediates Casparian strip formation in the endodermis.Nature. 2011; 473: 380-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). We tested whether SGN4/RBOHF is required for the expression, accumulation, or localization of the CASPs, which could cause the observed delay in Casparian strip formation. However, CASP1-GFP showed a normal accumulation and localization in the mutant (Figure 1D). Consistently, protein exclusion of generic plasma membrane markers and confinement of polarly localized proteins still occurs in rbohf (Figure S1), suggesting that the Casparian strip membrane domain (CSD) is present and functional. This places RBOHF downstream of the formation of the localized CASP platform, suggesting a role in the execution of the cell wall formation, guided by the CASPs.Figure S1Casparian Strip Membrane Domain and Plasma Membrane Polarity Are Retained in rbohf Mutant, Related to Figure 1Show full captionAll pictures are longitudinal, median optical section of endodermal cells.

Lignin formation requires oxidation of monolignols, which is thought to be catalyzed by peroxidases. Peroxidases require hydrogen peroxide (H202) for this oxidation and NADPH oxidases have been implicated as major sources of regulated superoxide production, which can be enzymatically or nonenzymatically dismutated into H202. Therefore, we considered it most straightforward that SGN4/RBOHF would be needed for the production of H202 as a peroxidase cosubstrate. In this scenario, RBOHF has a very direct role, and even short-term inhibition of the NADPH oxidase should be able to block Casparian strip formation. The NADPH oxidase inhibitor diphenylene iodonium (DPI) allows us to precisely time the inhibition of NADPH oxidase activity, but its general effect on all NADPH oxidases severely inhibits root growth and causes cell death after prolonged treatment, making it difficult to analyze slow developmental processes (Figure S2). We therefore resorted to a recently developed short-term assay for Casparian strip formation (Naseer et al., 2012Naseer S. Lee Y. Lapierre C. Franke R. Nawrath C. Geldner N. Casparian strip diffusion barrier in Arabidopsis is made of a lignin polymer without suberin.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2012; 109: 10101-10106Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). For this, seedlings are grown for 24 hr on the monolignol biosynthesis inhibitor, piperonylic acid. Cells that have not formed Casparian strips are then induced to do so by externally supplying monolignols, leading to formation of Casparian strips within only 6 hr (Naseer et al., 2012Naseer S. Lee Y. Lapierre C. Franke R. Nawrath C. Geldner N. Casparian strip diffusion barrier in Arabidopsis is made of a lignin polymer without suberin.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2012; 109: 10101-10106Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar) (Figure S3). This allowed us to investigate the immediate effect of NADPH oxidases on Casparian strip formation, uncoupled from their effect on general developmental processes. By coapplying DPI with monolignols, we observed a complete block in Casparian strip reconstitution after 6 hr, supporting a direct requirement of NADPH oxidases for lignin polymerization in the endodermis (Figure 2A). Continued PI uptake confirmed that the endodermal diffusion barrier had not formed and additionally showed that the DPI concentration and timescale used did not lead to any cell death, as this would lead to the appearance of strongly PI-stained nuclei (Figures 2A and S2).Figure S3Casparian Strip Formation Blocked by Monolignol Biosynthesis Inhibitor Is Complemented by Exogenous Application of Monolignols, Related to Figure 2Show full caption(A) Schematic representation of a seedling explaining how block in Casparian strip formation is complemented by exogenously applied monolignols.

Scale bars, 10 μm (A); 0.5 μm (B). We then tested whether we could observe production of apoplastic H202 in the endodermis. To do so, we used the cerium chloride assay. Cerium chloride forms electron-dense precipitates in the presence of H202 through formation of cerium perhydroxide, which can be observed with electron microscopy, providing us with the necessary resolution. With this assay, we observed strikingly localized cerium precipitations in endodermal cells, exclusively at the position of Casparian strips. While early Casparian strips displayed precipitates throughout their width, mature strips only showed signals at their outward-facing edge. The lack of signal at inward-facing edges is most probably due to the fact that more mature Casparian strips can function as an apoplastic barrier, not allowing uptake of cerium chloride beyond this point (Figure 2B). Sixty minutes of DPI treatment before cerium chloride application led to an almost complete absence of local H202, indicating that NADPH oxidases are responsible for this highly localized production of H202 (Figure 2B; Table S3). These findings strongly suggested that an NADPH oxidase is either localized or locally activated at the sites of Casparian strip formation. The specific role of RBOHF in Casparian strip formation was surprising, considering that at least one other NADPH oxidase, RBOHB, is strongly expressed in endodermal tissues (Figure S4). Indeed, insertion lines of RBOHB, or of four other root-expressed NADPH oxidases tested, did not display any delay in Casparian strip formation, nor did double mutants with RBOHF increase the severity of the RBOHF single mutant (Figure 3A). In addition, we recovered six alleles of RBOHF—but no other NADPH oxidase—in our large-scale forward genetic screen (Figure 1A). This strongly suggests that RBOHF plays a unique role in Casparian strip (CS) formation. A first explanation for its unique function was provided when we localized a complementing fusion construct of RBOHF (mCherry-RBOHFgen) and found that it displayed accumulation in the Casparian strip domain (Figures 3B–3D and S5A), while identical fusions of RBOHB and D were excluded from there (Figure 3E). The CSD localization of RBOHF was surprising, since all other plasma membrane proteins tested so far are excluded from this highly scaffolded domain that even blocks lateral diffusion of lipid tracers like FM4-64 (Alassimone et al., 2010Alassimone J.

Beeckman T. Geldner N. A novel protein family mediates Casparian strip formation in the endodermis.Nature. 2011; 473: 380-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). Therefore, RBOHF entry into this domain probably requires specific interactions between RBOHF and Casparian strip domain proteins like the CASPs. We conclude that differential localization is one element"
https://openalex.org/W2163261207,"Recent exon sequencing studies have revealed that over 20% of human tumors have mutations in subunits of mSWI/SNF (BAF) complexes. To investigate the underlying mechanism, we studied human synovial sarcoma (SS), in which transformation results from the translocation of exactly 78 amino acids of SSX to the SS18 subunit of BAF complexes. We demonstrate that the SS18-SSX fusion protein competes for assembly with wild-type SS18, forming an altered complex lacking the tumor suppressor BAF47 (hSNF5). The altered complex binds the Sox2 locus and reverses polycomb-mediated repression, resulting in Sox2 activation. Sox2 is uniformly expressed in SS tumors and is essential for proliferation. Increasing the concentration of wild-type SS18 leads to reassembly of wild-type complexes retargeted away from the Sox2 locus, polycomb-mediated repression of Sox2, and cessation of proliferation. This mechanism of transformation depends on only two amino acids of SSX, providing a potential foundation for therapeutic intervention."

Although early detection and monitoring of patients with liver cirrhosis can substantially improve 5 year survival rates, progression to advanced HCC reduces average life expectancy to less than 8 months (Llovet et al., 2008Llovet J.M.

The capacity to catalog the full spectrum of genetic aberrations occurring in HCC is therefore of critical importance. LINE-1 (L1) retrotransposons are a major source of endogenous mutagenesis in humans (Burns and Boeke, 2012Burns K.H. Boeke J.D.

Dynamic interactions between transposable elements and their hosts.Nat. Rev. Genet. 2011; 12: 615-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar). These mobile genetic elements utilize a “copy-and-paste” mechanism to retrotranspose to new genomic loci, with such success in germ cells that 500,000 L1 copies comprise ∼17% of the genome (Lander et al., 2001Lander E.S.

FitzHugh W. et al.International Human Genome Sequencing ConsortiumInitial sequencing and analysis of the human genome.Nature. 2001; 409: 860-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (17779) Google Scholar). Of these copies, only 80–100 are transposition competent, with distinct subsets of frequently active—or “hot”—L1s driving insertional mutagenesis in each individual genome (Beck et al., 2010Beck C.R.

L1 activity is consequently suppressed in most somatic cells by methylation of a CpG island in the internal L1 promoter (Coufal et al., 2009Coufal N.G. Garcia-Perez J.L. Peng G.E. Yeo G.W. Mu Y. Lovci M.T. Morell M. O’Shea K.S. Moran J.V. Gage F.H.

Identification, characterization, and cell specificity of a human LINE-1 promoter.Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 6718-6729Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). By contrast, L1 is often hypomethylated in tumor cells, removing a key obstacle to retrotransposition (Levin and Moran, 2011Levin H.L. Moran J.V. Dynamic interactions between transposable elements and their hosts.Nat. Rev. Genet. 2011; 12: 615-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar). Despite this failure to repress L1 transcription, only a handful of L1 insertions had been found in human tumors until very recently (Liu et al., 1997Liu J. Nau M.M. Zucman-Rossi J. Powell J.I. Allegra C.J. Wright J.J.

High-throughput L1 integration site sequencing has since revealed 9 and 69 de novo L1 insertions, respectively, in lung and colorectal tumors (Iskow et al., 2010Iskow R.C. McCabe M.T. Mills R.E.

Erlanger B. et al.Extensive somatic L1 retrotransposition in colorectal tumors.Genome Res. 2012; 22: 2328-2338Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar), whereas cancer genome resequencing elucidated a further 183 tumor-specific L1 insertions in colorectal, ovarian, and prostate cancer (Lee et al., 2012Lee E. Iskow R. Yang L. Gokcumen O. Haseley P. Luquette 3rd, L.J. Lohr J.G. Harris C.C. Ding L. Wilson R.K. et al.Cancer Genome Atlas Research NetworkLandscape of somatic retrotransposition in human cancers.Science. 2012; 337: 967-971Crossref PubMed Scopus (514) Google Scholar). In this latter study, more than half of all insertions were found in a single colorectal tumor; the other individuals presented fewer than five tumor-specific L1 insertions on average. These data suggest L1 mobilization may be common in epithelial tumors, though the reasons for possible cell-of-origin restriction are currently unknown. Tumor-specific L1 retrotransposition has not previously been observed in HCC. For several reasons it is, however, a logical cancer in which to expect L1 mobilization. First, HCC is epithelial in origin. Second, HBV and HCV infection are common in HCC; viruses can suppress host defense factors, such as APOBEC proteins, that control retrotransposon activation. APOBEC3G has been shown, for instance, to inhibit both HBV replication and endogenous retrotransposition (Esnault et al., 2005Esnault C. Heidmann O. Delebecque F. Dewannieux M. Ribet D. Hance A.J. Heidmann T. Schwartz O. APOBEC3G cytidine deaminase inhibits retrotransposition of endogenous retroviruses.Nature. 2005; 433: 430-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar; Turelli et al., 2004Turelli P. Mangeat B. Jost S. Vianin S. Trono D. Inhibition of hepatitis B virus replication by APOBEC3G.Science. 2004; 303: 1829Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar). Third, liver inflammation precedes HCC and may, via cellular stress, stimulate retrotransposition (Fornace and Mitchell, 1986Fornace Jr., A.J. Mitchell J.B. Induction of B2 RNA polymerase III transcription by heat shock: enrichment for heat shock induced sequences in rodent cells by hybridization subtraction.Nucleic Acids Res. 1986; 14: 5793-5811Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Given these facts, we aimed to map L1 integration sites in HCC using retrotransposon capture sequencing (RC-seq) and assess their impact upon oncogenic and tumor suppressor pathways. To test the hypothesis that L1 mobilizes in HCC, we applied an updated RC-seq protocol to 19 HCC tumors and matched adjacent liver tissue that were confirmed positive for HBV or HCV infection (Table 1). An earlier RC-seq design (Baillie et al., 2011Baillie J.K. Barnett M.W. Upton K.R. Gerhardt D.J. Richmond T.A. De Sapio F. Brennan P.M. Rizzu P. Smith S. Fell M. et al.Somatic retrotransposition alters the genetic landscape of the human brain.Nature. 2011; 479: 534-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (510) Google Scholar) was modified to incorporate multiplex liquid-phase sequence capture (Figure 1A) using a refined probe pool (Table S1 available online) and a reduced insert size of ∼220 nt, which enabled high-confidence assembly of overlapping paired-end 150 nt reads (Figure 1B). This change simplified genomic alignment and, more importantly, enabled single-nucleotide resolution of retrotransposon integration sites (Figure 1C).Table 1Nonreference Genome Insertions Detected by RC-SeqDonorGenderVirusAgeGermline InsertionsPrivate Germline InsertionsValidated Tumor-Specific Insertions12MHCV652,082202315MHBV531,845216121MHCV512,019271029MHCV521,60244032MHBV731,681100033FHCV571,982234235FHCV781,78696042FHCV671,59443047MHBV611,58177248MHBV351,744212049MHCV681,64458060MHCV481,57033062MHBV331,750153070MHCV551,67382086FHBV561,70150089MHBV601,739163495MHBV541,773880106MHBV602,141480116MHBV621,532710F, female; M, male.

After stringent filtering and mapping, an average of ∼2 million reads were retained per library with >95% identity to active L1, Alu, and SVA families, as well as the most recently active human LTR endogenous retroviruses (Table S2). Optimized sequence capture led to a 4-fold increase in reads aligned to nonreference genome L1s per library compared to previous RC-seq based on solid-phase arrays and similar sequencing depth (Baillie et al., 2011Baillie J.K. Barnett M.W. Upton K.R. Gerhardt D.J. Richmond T.A. De Sapio F. Brennan P.M. Rizzu P. Smith S. Fell M. et al.Somatic retrotransposition alters the genetic landscape of the human brain.Nature. 2011; 479: 534-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (510) Google Scholar). The improved resolution of RC-seq also allowed us to discriminate a required minimum of two unique amplicons in support of any nonreference genome insertion (see Extended Experimental Procedures). A total of 7,689 nonreference genome insertions were detected in 19 tumor (T) samples and 19 matched nontumor (NT) liver samples. Of these, we annotated 7,644 as putatively germline (Table S3) because of their presence in (1) databases of retrotransposon-induced polymorphisms (Beck et al., 2010Beck C.R. Collier P. Macfarlane C.

L1, Alu, SVA, and LTR-flanked retrotransposons comprised 13.5%, 81.8%, 4.3%, and 0.4% of germline insertions, respectively. As expected, L1-Ta and L1-pre-Ta (99.3%) and AluY (99.7%) were the main L1 and Alu subfamilies active in germ cells (Mills et al., 2007Mills R.E. Bennett E.A. Iskow R.C. Devine S.E.

A total of 2,241 germline insertions were found in only one individual each (Table 1 and Table S3) and were not annotated by the aforementioned retrotransposon polymorphism databases, suggesting that these were private or rare mutations or, alternatively, had occurred in early development (Garcia-Perez et al., 2007Garcia-Perez J.L.

RC-seq detected 1,489 (66.4%) insertions at both their 5′ and 3′ ends, enabling us to model the characteristic sequence features of L1-mediated retrotransposition. Without any additional sequencing, we were able to analyze insertions for the presence of target site duplications (TSDs), an L1-endonuclease recognition motif (Jurka, 1997Jurka J.

These features consistently resembled target-primed reverse transcription (TPRT) for L1, Alu, and SVA, again illustrating the primary retrotransposition mechanism in germ cells (Cost et al., 2002Cost G.J.

We also identified 160 previously undetected full-length (>99.9%) L1 copies, including 115 with paired 5′/3′ detection (Figure 2C; Table S4) and 82 each found in a single donor only. All were annotated as L1-Ta or pre-Ta. These potentially “hot” L1s added to a recent cohort of full-length L1 insertions found in six geographically diverse individuals via fosmid screening and sequencing (Beck et al., 2010Beck C.R.

Therefore, to assess the RC-seq false-positive rate, we randomly selected 200 germline insertions (173 Alu, 14 L1, 11 SVA, and 2 LTR) for site-specific PCR validation (Table S5). Of these, we confirmed 197 (98.5%). The remaining three insertions (2 SVA and 1 Alu) occurred in repetitive genomic regions and were detected by multiple unique reads in at least ten different samples each, indicating that these may have represented PCR false negatives. These comparisons and experiments together demonstrate the sensitive and accurate mapping of bona fide retrotransposition events by RC-seq and further highlight ongoing L1 retrotransposition in the global human population (Beck et al., 2010Beck C.R.

To assess the potential tumorigenic consequences of the identified nonreference genome insertions, we selected and validated, by insertion site PCR, 31 L1, Alu, and SVA insertions in genes generally implicated to play a causal role in cancer (Futreal et al., 2004Futreal P.A.

Genet. 2012; 44: 694-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (1037) Google Scholar), including L1 insertions in the proto-oncogene ALK and the tumor suppressor FHIT (Table S5). Quantitative RT-PCR indicated, however, that 28/31 of these germline insertions did not significantly perturb host gene expression in tumor or nontumor liver versus control liver from five unaffected individuals (data not shown). Strikingly, the three remaining insertions all coincided with strong inhibition of the tumor suppressor mutated in colorectal cancers (MCC) (Higgins et al., 2007Higgins M.E. Claremont M. Major J.E.

MCC is also an intriguing HCC candidate gene because of its genomic proximity to APC, a major tumor suppressor mutated in familial adenomatous polyposis preceding colorectal cancer (Groden et al., 1991Groden J. Thliveris A. Samowitz W. Carlson M. Gelbert L. Albertsen H. Joslyn G. Stevens J. Spirio L.

It is important to note that mutated APC occurs in <2% of HCC cases versus >60% of colorectal carcinomas (Guichard et al., 2012Guichard C. Amaddeo G. Imbeaud S. Ladeiro Y. Pelletier L. Maad I.B. Calderaro J. Bioulac-Sage P. Letexier M. Degos F. et al.Integrated analysis of somatic mutations and focal copy-number changes identifies key genes and pathways in hepatocellular carcinoma.Nat.

APC mutations occur early during colorectal tumorigenesis.Nature. 1992; 359: 235-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (1677) Google Scholar). We therefore hypothesized that germline retrotransposition events specifically inhibited MCC tumor suppressor function in liver. To test this prediction, we assessed the impact of each MCC mutation upon MCC, APC, and CTNNB1 expression. Three germline retrotransposon insertions were found in MCC. The first of these, labeled MCC-L1-α, comprised a 5.3 kb L1-Ta oriented in sense to MCC in donors 70 and 95 (Figure 3A). Another L1-Ta, labeled MCC-L1-β, was full-length (6 kb), occurred at a different genomic position in donor 116, and was oriented antisense to MCC (Figure 3B). Finally, in donor 33, we found an AluY (MCC-Alu; Figure 3C) inserted in an ENCODE-delineated enhancer (Thurman et al., 2012Thurman R.E. Rynes E. Humbert R. Vierstra J. Maurano M.T. Haugen E.

Here, we show that developmental rate, reproduction, and lifespan are altered in C. elegans fed Comamonas DA1877 relative to those fed a standard E. coli OP50 diet. We identify a set of genes that change in expression in response to this diet and use the promoter of one of these (acdh-1) as a dietary sensor. Remarkably, the effects on transcription and development occur even when Comamonas DA1877 is diluted with another diet, suggesting that Comamonas DA1877 generates a signal that is sensed by the nematode. Surprisingly, the developmental effect is independent from TOR and insulin signaling. Rather, Comamonas DA1877 affects cyclic gene expression during molting, likely through the nuclear hormone receptor NHR-23. Altogether, our findings indicate that different bacteria elicit various responses via distinct mechanisms, which has implications for diseases such as obesity and the interactions between the human microbiome and intestinal cells."

The tunable topological and magnetic properties in this system are well suited for realizing the exotic topological quantum phenomena in magnetic topological insulators."
https://openalex.org/W2025763309,"Salmonella effector proteins trigger host innate immunity through the activation of small Rho GTPases, which, in turn, is sensed by the NOD1/2 signalling pathway. The mammalian innate immune system distinguishes self from invading microbes through the detection of conserved pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) by Toll-like receptors. But that is not enough: all microbes, regardless of pathogenic potential, produce PAMPs and the innate immune system has mechanisms to determine which microbes pose the greatest threats. One such system is described here. The Salmonella virulence factor SopE, and peptidoglycans from other pathogens, are shown to trigger host immunity by activating small Rho GTPases that are in turn sensed by the NOD1/2 signalling pathway. Thus by monitoring the activation state of small Rho GTPases, a cell can recognize toxin-producing intruders. Our innate immune system distinguishes microbes from self by detecting conserved pathogen-associated molecular patterns1. However, these are produced by all microbes, regardless of their pathogenic potential. To distinguish virulent microbes from those with lower disease-causing potential the innate immune system detects conserved pathogen-induced processes2, such as the presence of microbial products in the host cytosol, by mechanisms that are not fully resolved. Here we show that NOD1 senses cytosolic microbial products by monitoring the activation state of small Rho GTPases. Activation of RAC1 and CDC42 by bacterial delivery or ectopic expression of SopE, a virulence factor of the enteric pathogen Salmonella, triggered the NOD1 signalling pathway, with consequent RIP2 (also known as RIPK2)-mediated induction of NF-κB-dependent inflammatory responses. Similarly, activation of the NOD1 signalling pathway by peptidoglycan required RAC1 activity. Furthermore, constitutively active forms of RAC1, CDC42 and RHOA activated the NOD1 signalling pathway. Our data identify the activation of small Rho GTPases as a pathogen-induced process sensed through the NOD1 signalling pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2010231976,"The X-ray crystal structure of a high-affinity phosphate importer in an inward-facing, occluded state in the presence of phosphate is reported; this is the first structure of a membrane protein involved in inorganic phosphate uptake and the first crystal structure of a eukaryotic MFS transporter. Proton/phosphate symporters of the major facilitator superfamily (MFS) are key to the uptake of inorganic phosphate in fungi and plants. This manuscript reports the X-ray crystal structure of a fungal high-affinity phosphate importer, PiPT, in an inward-facing, 'occluded' state in the presence of phosphate. The structure explains the mechanism for phosphate affinity and specificity, and connects the proton-motive force to phosphate translocation. PiPT also provides a useful model for key transporters whose malfunctions in humans are associated with diseases such as cancer and diabetes, as well as those that mediate drug metabolism. Phosphate is crucial for structural and metabolic needs, including nucleotide and lipid synthesis, signalling and chemical energy storage. Proton-coupled transporters of the major facilitator superfamily (MFS) are essential for phosphate uptake in plants and fungi, and also have a function in sensing external phosphate levels as transceptors1,2,3,4,5. Here we report the 2.9 Å structure of a fungal (Piriformospora indica) high-affinity phosphate transporter, PiPT, in an inward-facing occluded state, with bound phosphate visible in the membrane-buried binding site. The structure indicates both proton and phosphate exit pathways and suggests a modified asymmetrical ‘rocker-switch’ mechanism of phosphate transport. PiPT is related to several human transporter families, most notably the organic cation and anion transporters of the solute carrier family (SLC22), which are implicated in cancer-drug resistance6,7. We modelled representative cation and anion SLC22 transporters based on the PiPT structure to surmise the structural basis for substrate binding and charge selectivity in this important family. The PiPT structure demonstrates and expands on principles of substrate transport by the MFS transporters and illuminates principles of phosphate uptake in particular."
https://openalex.org/W2046808709,"The last step of cell division, cytokinesis, produces two daughter cells that remain connected by an intercellular bridge. This state often represents the longest stage of the division process. Severing the bridge (abscission) requires a well-described series of molecular events, but the trigger for abscission remains unknown. We found that pulling forces exerted by daughter cells on the intercellular bridge appear to regulate abscission. Counterintuitively, these forces prolonged connection, whereas a release of tension induced abscission. Tension release triggered the assembly of ESCRT-III (endosomal sorting complex required for transport–III), which was followed by membrane fission. This mechanism may allow daughter cells to remain connected until they have settled in their final locations, a process potentially important for tissue organization and morphogenesis."

Many of these proteins operate at pivotal positions in determining how genotype is translated into phenotype. But the breadth of prion influences on biology and their evolutionary significance are just beginning to be explored. We report that a prion formed by the Mot3 transcription factor, [MOT3(+)], governs the acquisition of facultative multicellularity in the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The traits governed by [MOT3(+)] involved both gains and losses of Mot3 regulatory activity. [MOT3(+)]-dependent expression of FLO11, a major determinant of cell-cell adhesion, produced diverse lineage-specific multicellular phenotypes in response to nutrient deprivation. The prions themselves were induced by ethanol and eliminated by hypoxia-conditions that occur sequentially in the natural respiro-fermentative cycles of yeast populations. These data demonstrate that prions can act as environmentally responsive molecular determinants of multicellularity and contribute to the natural morphological diversity of budding yeast."

Here we show that conditional deletion of PLCε in mouse cardiac myocytes protects from stress-induced pathological hypertrophy. PLCε small interfering RNA (siRNA) in ventricular myocytes decreases endothelin-1 (ET-1)-dependent elevation of nuclear calcium and activation of nuclear protein kinase D (PKD). PLCε scaffolded to muscle-specific A kinase-anchoring protein (mAKAP), along with PKCε and PKD, localizes these components at or near the nuclear envelope, and this complex is required for nuclear PKD activation. Phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate (PI4P) is identified as a perinuclear substrate in the Golgi apparatus for mAKAP-scaffolded PLCε. We conclude that perinuclear PLCε, scaffolded to mAKAP in cardiac myocytes, responds to hypertrophic stimuli to generate diacylglycerol (DAG) from PI4P in the Golgi apparatus, in close proximity to the nuclear envelope, to regulate activation of nuclear PKD and hypertrophic signaling pathways."
https://openalex.org/W2017344623,"The MST/YAP (mammalian Ste20-like kinase/Yes-associated protein 2) pathway plays an important role in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Although post-translational modification—especially MST/Lats (large tumor suppressor)-mediated phosphorylation and PP1 (protein phosphatase-1)-mediated dephosphorylation—has been found to regulate the activity of YAP2, very little is known about its acetylation. In our experiments, we observed that the expression of SIRT1 is significantly upregulated in the tumor samples of the hepatocarcinoma patients, and SIRT1 mRNA level positively correlates with connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) mRNA level. We then found that SIRT1 deacetylates YAP2 protein in HCC cells and SIRT1-mediated deacetylation increases the YAP2/TEAD4 association, leading to YAP2/TEAD4 transcriptional activation and upregulated cell growth in HCC cells. Moreover, knockdown of SIRT1 blocks the cisplatin (CDDP)-induced nuclear translocation of YAP2 and enhances the chemosensitivity of HCC cells to CDDP treatment. Together, our findings reveal a new regulatory mechanism of YAP2 by the SIRT1-mediated deacetylation that may be involved in HCC tumorigenesis and drug resistance."

Here, we combine forward and reverse genetic screens to delineate a network of 184 genes that affect the C. elegans dietary response to Comamonas DA1877 bacteria. We find that perturbation of a mitochondrial network composed of enzymes involved in amino acid metabolism and the TCA cycle affects the dietary response. In humans, mutations in the corresponding genes cause inborn diseases of amino acid metabolism, most of which are treated by dietary intervention. We identify several transcription factors (TFs) that mediate the changes in gene expression upon metabolic network perturbations. Altogether, our findings unveil a transcriptional response system that is poised to sense dietary cues and metabolic imbalances, illustrating extensive communication between metabolic networks in the mitochondria and gene regulatory networks in the nucleus."

USA. 2010; 107: 17268-17273Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Within this locus, an N-Methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR)-associated gene, dlgap1, was one of several candidate proinvasive genes selectively upregulated in invasive carcinomas. We were led, therefore, to consider the potential involvement of the NMDAR in PNET tumorigenesis, especially in invasion. NMDAR is a receptor governing synaptic plasticity in the CNS, where it plays important roles in learning, memory, and neuron maturation. NMDARs have also been detected in various human tumor samples and cell lines, and patch-clamp experiments in several cancer cell lines have demonstrated receptor functionality (Stepulak et al., 2009Stepulak A. Luksch H. Gebhardt C. Uckermann O. Marzahn J. Sifringer M. Rzeski W. Staufner C. Brocke K.S. Turski L. Ikonomidou C. Expression of glutamate receptor subunits in human cancers.Histochem. Cell Biol. 2009; 132: 435-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). However, the functional importance of NMDAR signaling in cancers is unclear. Notably, the mechanistic contributions and pathologic significance of NMDAR activation in elaborating cancer phenotypes are poorly understood (Prickett and Samuels, 2012Prickett T.D. Samuels Y. Molecular pathways: dysregulated glutamatergic signaling pathways in cancer.Clin. Cancer Res. 2012; 18: 4240-4246Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Glutamate, the major physiological agonist of the NMDAR, has long been implicated in cancer (Rzeski et al., 2001Rzeski W. Turski L. Ikonomidou C. Glutamate antagonists limit tumor growth.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2001; 98: 6372-6377Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). A role in promoting tumor growth and invasion was first established in glioma (Takano et al., 2001Takano T. Lin J.H. Arcuino G. Gao Q. Yang J. Nedergaard M. Glutamate release promotes growth of malignant gliomas.Nat. Med. 2001; 7: 1010-1015Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar). Subsequently, an increasing number of cancer cells have been found to secrete glutamate (Seidlitz et al., 2009Seidlitz E.P. Sharma M.K. Saikali Z. Ghert M. Singh G. Cancer cell lines release glutamate into the extracellular environment.Clin. Exp. Metastasis. 2009; 26: 781-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar; Sharma et al., 2010Sharma M.K. Seidlitz E.P. Singh G. Cancer cells release glutamate via the cystine/glutamate antiporter.Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2010; 391: 91-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) although the effector mechanisms and functional importance of secreted glutamate remain elusive. Glutamate is a ligand for two classes of receptors that are either G protein coupled or ion channels; NMDAR is a member of the ionotropic class. Protumoral effects of glutamate have been attributed to its signaling via G-protein-coupled glutamate receptors (Nicoletti et al., 2007Nicoletti F. Arcella A. Iacovelli L. Battaglia G. Giangaspero F. Melchiorri D. Metabotropic glutamate receptors: new targets for the control of tumor growth?.Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2007; 28: 206-213Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) or via the AMPA receptor (Herner et al., 2011Herner A. Sauliunaite D. Michalski C.W. Erkan M. De Oliveira T. Abiatari I. Kong B. Esposito I. Friess H. Kleeff J. Glutamate increases pancreatic cancer cell invasion and migration via AMPA receptor activation and Kras-MAPK signaling.Int. J. Cancer. 2011; 129: 2349-2359Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), another ionotropic glutamate receptor; in contrast, there is little evidence implicating glutamate signaling via NMDAR in cancer phenotypes. Motivated by these various considerations, we sought to determine whether the NMDAR and its ligand glutamate might be involved in invasive growth in the mouse model of PNET and, if so, to investigate the regulation and mechanistic effects of NMDAR signaling in such tumors and the possible translational relevance to human cancer. The RIP1-Tag2 line of transgenic mice presents a genetically engineered mouse model (GEMM) of human PNET (Hanahan, 1985Hanahan D. Heritable formation of pancreatic beta-cell tumours in transgenic mice expressing recombinant insulin/simian virus 40 oncogenes.Nature. 1985; 315: 115-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (1013) Google Scholar). We found that both subunits of the heterodimeric NMDAR, namely NR1 (Figure S1 available online) and NR2b (Figure 1A), were expressed in PNETs arising in this model. NR2b expression was elevated toward the tumor periphery (Figures 1A and 1B, i), particularly at invasion fronts (Figure 1C). The increased NR2b expression at the tumor periphery was evident in 96.6% of PNETs examined (Figure 1B, i), and the elevation of NR2b expression toward the tumor periphery was more evident as tumor size increased (Figure 1B, ii). Moreover, NR2b phosphorylation at Y1252, which enhances NMDAR activity (Takasu et al., 2002Takasu M.A. Dalva M.B. Zigmond R.E. Greenberg M.E. Modulation of NMDA receptor-dependent calcium influx and gene expression through EphB receptors.Science. 2002; 295: 491-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar), was more pronounced at the tumor periphery than in the tumor center (Figure 1D). We also examined the expression of NMDAR in mouse models of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) (Grippo and Tuveson, 2010Grippo P.J. Tuveson D.A. Deploying mouse models of pancreatic cancer for chemoprevention studies.Cancer Prev. Res. (Phila.). 2010; 3: 1382-1387Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) and breast cancer (Fantozzi and Christofori, 2006Fantozzi A. Christofori G. Mouse models of breast cancer metastasis.Breast Cancer Res. 2006; 8: 212Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). NR2b was also variably upregulated at the tumor periphery or in invasive cells in these GEMMs (Figures 1E–1G and Table S1). Although the RIP1-Tag2 model is highly synchronized, presenting with discrete tumors as a function of age that renders them easily quantifiable, both the breast and PDAC models are temporally and histologically heterogeneous, with merged lesions of varying tumor grades noted in late stage disease. Thus we were not able to quantify the patterns of NMDAR expression in these two GEMMs.Figure 1Involvement of NMDAR Signaling in Genetically Engineered Mouse Models of Cancer—Descriptive EvidenceShow full caption(A) In the RIP1-Tag2 mouse model of pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (PNET), expression of the NMDAR subunit 2b (NR2b) is selectively elevated at tumor periphery as compared to tumor center (images were taken from the same tumor).(B) Semiquantification of NR2b expression in mouse PNETs. (i) A pair of images was taken from each tumor analyzed, one from the center and the other from the periphery.

See also Figure S1 and Table S1. Having documented the elevated expression of NMDAR in several GEMMs of human cancer, we next audited NMDAR expression using human tissue microarrays (TMA). High NR2b expression was noted in some samples from pancreatic ductal carcinoma (Figure S2A), breast cancer (Figures 2A and 2B ), ovarian cancer (Figure 2C), and glioma (Figure 2E), but not in others (Table S2). In the breast cancer TMA, we found that high NR2b expression was associated with the HER2 subtype, whereas negative NR2b expression was observed more in the luminal subtype (Figures 2A and S2B), suggesting that NR2b had different expression patterns among different subtypes. Interestingly, one patient sample in the breast cancer TMA expressed an intermediate to high level of NR2b and showed invasion into adjacent adipose tissues (Figure 2B), whereas a paired sample from the same patient in the same TMA, which was not immediately adjacent to the invasion fronts, expressed only low level of NR2b (Figure 2B).Figure S2Involvement of NMDAR Signaling in Human Cancers—Descriptive Evidence, Related to Figure 2Show full caption(A) In a limited survey of human pancreatic adenocarcinoma TMA, high expression of NR2b was identified in a subset of cancer cells. One representative image is shown.(B) The NR2b was differentially expressed in different breast cancer subtypes. The subtypes were defined as described in the Extended Experimental Procedures. The contingency table was analyzed with Chi-square test, with Chi-square = 13.08, degree of freedom = 6, and p = 0.0418. A total of 72 breast cancer samples from 36 patients in the TMA were analyzed. Two sarcoma samples were excluded, as were seven other cancer samples due to poor sample quality, tissue detachment from the slides, etc. Thus NR2b expression was assessed in 63 breast cancer samples.(C) NMDAR signaling is implicated in ovarian cancer, as high expression of vGlut2 and NR2b was a signature for poor prognosis in advanced stage ovarian cancer patients. The prognosis difference was not significant when patients from all different stages were pooled. However, when only stage III patients were included, who represented the majority of patients in the TCGA data sets (391 stage III patients out of 503 total patients with documented survival data) the survival difference was significant with median overall survival increasing from 36.9 months in NR2b/vGlut2 high patients to 49.4 months in NR2b/vGlut2 low patients.(D) High expression of NR2b alone was a signature for poor prognosis in glioblastoma (GBM) patients. Subdividing patients into vGlut high/low groups in both NR2b low and high group further separated the survival curves.

For data with more than two curves, i.e., combined analysis of NR2b and vGlut family genes, log rank test for trend was performed to assess if there was a survival trend in the four curves analyzed. In addition, in the combined analysis of NR2b and vGlut family genes, two curves presumably representing low and high NMDAR signaling axis, i.e., the NR2b-low/vGlut-low versus the NR2b-high/vGlut-high groups, were isolated for another log rank test to compare these two groups.

Also see Table S2. Glutamate is the major agonist for NMDAR. In neurons, vesicular glutamate transporters (vGlut1, -2, and -3) export glutamate to initiate signaling. Thus we assessed vGlut expression in conjunction with NMDAR for possible association with cancer patient survival in the TCGA database. In our survey of human cancer, TMAs we had found overexpression of NR2b in glioma (Figure 2E) and in ovarian cancer (Figure 2C). When we segregated glioblastoma (grade 4 glioma) patients by levels of both NR2b and vGlut2 into higher and lower expressing groups (see Extended Experimental Procedures), the difference was striking: the median survival was 4.4 months longer in the vGlut2/NR2b-low group, reaching 15.2 months as compared to 10.8 months for the vGlut2/NR2b-high group (Figures 2F and S2D). Notably, vGlut1 and vGlut3 levels had a similar correlation (Figure S2D). We also analyzed the ovarian cancer data set in TCGA and found a similar trend: the median survival was one year longer in the NR2b/vGlut2-low expression group than in the high expression group (Figures 2D and S2C). In contrast, in the TCGA lung squamous cell carcinoma data set, low versus high expression of NR2b/vGluts was not associated with differential patient prognosis (Figure S2E), suggesting, quite reasonably, that not all tumor types are affected by variable levels of NMDAR. Motivated by our observations that the NMDAR was expressed at elevated levels in various human cancer types compared to cognate normal tissues and that patients whose tumors had comparatively higher levels had worse prognosis, we returned to the mouse PNET model to investigate possible roles of NMDAR signaling in this form of cancer. First, we employed the βTC-3 cancer cell line, derived from a PNET tumor in a RIP1-Tag2 mouse (Efrat et al., 1988Efrat S. Linde S. Kofod H. Spector D. Delannoy M. Grant S. Hanahan D. Baekkeskov S. Beta-cell lines derived from transgenic mice expressing a hybrid insulin gene-oncogene.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1988; 85: 9037-9041Crossref PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar), to investigate the potential involvement of NMDAR in cancer cell phenotypes in vitro. We used an NMDAR antagonist, MK801, to study the possible contributions of NMDAR—via its inhibition—on proliferation and apoptosis. MK801 is a selective, noncompetitive NMDAR inhibitor. MK801 blocks the calcium channel of the NR1 subunit with high affinity; as such it is one of the most potent known NMDAR antagonists. We applied MK801 to cultures of βTC-3 cancer cells and observed a time-dependent decrease in proliferation and increase in apoptosis (Figure 3A). In our previous experience, cultured PNET cancer cells (exemplified by the βTC-3 cell line) are weakly invasive in the traditional transwell invasion assay (Du et al., 2007Du Y.C. Lewis B.C. Hanahan D. Varmus H. Assessing tumor progression factors by somatic gene transfer into a mouse model: Bcl-xL promotes islet tumor cell invasion.PLoS Biol. 2007; 5: e276Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Therefore, we employed a modified invasion assay developed by Swartz and colleagues (Shields et al., 2007Shields J.D. Fleury M.E. Yong C. Tomei A.A. Randolph G.J. Swartz M.A. Autologous chemotaxis as a mechanism of tumor cell homing to lymphatics via interstitial flow and autocrine CCR7 signaling.Cancer Cell. 2007; 11: 526-538Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar) (Figures 3B and S3), which uses hydrostatic pressure to create a mimetic of interstitial fluid pressure and consequent fluid flow. As compared to the traditional static invasion assay, the flow-based invasion assay (Figure 3B) significantly increased βTC-3 invasiveness, which could be blocked by MK801, indicating a substantive role for NMDAR in cancer cell invasion in this ex vivo assay (Figure 3C). Because AMPAR, another glutamate receptor, has previously been implicated in promoting cancer invasion (Herner et al., 2011Herner A. Sauliunaite D. Michalski C.W. Erkan M. De Oliveira T. Abiatari I. Kong B. Esposito I. Friess H. Kleeff J. Glutamate increases pancreatic cancer cell invasion and migration via AMPA receptor activation and Kras-MAPK signaling.Int. J. Cancer. 2011; 129: 2349-2359Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), we also examined the effect of an AMPAR antagonist—GYKI52466—in the flow-based invasion assay. Modest anti-invasive activity was observed, albeit much weaker than that of MK801 (Figure 3C). To verify that these were not off-target effects of MK801, we knocked down the obligatory NMDAR subunit NR1 in βTC-3 cells and found that NR1 siRNA phenocopied the effects of the NMDAR inhibitor MK801 on cancer cell survival and invasiveness (Figure 3D). In our TMA survey, both pancreatic adenocarcinomas (Figure S2A) and breast cancers (Figures 2A and 2B) were found to express NR2b. Therefore, we performed some of the key in vitro experiments on a panel of human breast and pancreatic cancer cell lines that covered a variety of different subtypes (Table S3). Varying responses in terms of reduced cell survival (Figure 3E) and (flow-guided) invasion (Figure 3F) were noted in MK801-treated groups. Notably, the effect of MK801 on invasiveness was in general more pronounced than on survival. When the tested cell lines were divided into three groups according to their invasiveness in the modified invasion assay, we found that within both highly and moderately invasive groups, the response to MK801 correlated with NR2b mRNA expression (Figure 3G). In contrast, NR2b was barely detectable in the weakly invasive group, and in this group the treatment response was instead associated with NR2a expression (Figure 3G). Interestingly, there was no association between the level of NR2b or other NMDAR subunits and reduced cell survival upon treatment with MK801 (data not shown). Overall, the results suggest that elevated levels of NR2b expression are particularly deterministic for flow-mediated invasion. In light of demonstrating that NMDAR signaling was enhancing the cancer cell phenotypes of proliferation and invasiveness in conditions mimicking interstitial pressure-driven flow, we sought to assess the possible involvement of its ligand glutamate in regulating such phenotypes. By analyzing mRNA isolated from different stages of PNET tumorigenesis using qRT-PCR, we found increased vGlut gene expression in the solid tumor stage, as compared to normal pancreatic islets and premalignant stages (Figures 4A and S4A). This result is consistent with previous studies showing that vGluts are not expressed in normal mouse islet β cells but are detectable and fully functional in βTC-6 (Bai et al., 2003Bai L. Zhang X. Ghishan F.K. Characterization of vesicular glutamate transporter in pancreatic alpha - and beta -cells and its regulation by glucose.Am. J. Physiol. Gastrointest. Liver Physiol. 2003; 284: G808-G814Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), another PNET cell line derived from the RIP1-Tag2 mouse model (Poitout et al., 1995Poitout V. Stout L.E. Armstrong M.B. Walseth T.F. Sorenson R.L. Robertson R.P. Morphological and functional characterization of beta TC-6 cells—an insulin-secreting cell line derived from transgenic mice.Diabetes. 1995; 44: 306-313Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Notably, the expression level varied considerably among tumors, as shown by the floating bars covering minimum to maximum values (Figure 4A). This observation is indicative of heterogeneous activation of NMDAR signaling among PNETs, consistent with the considerable range of NR2b staining in different tumors (Figure 1B). To pinpoint the cellular sources of glutamate, we used fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) to separate PNETs into their different constituent cell types. In neurons, classical paracrine NMDAR signaling involves presynaptic neurons expressing vGluts that mediate glutamate secretion to stimulate postsynaptic neurons expressing the glutamate receptor NMDAR, as well as glial cells (and sometimes neurons) expressing EAATs (excitatory amino-acid transporters) that remove extracellular glutamate to modulate NMDAR signaling. By qRT-PCR, we identifi"

Many ncRNAs assemble with proteins and function as ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complexes. These RNPs include small nuclear RNPs that function in pre-mRNA splicing, small nucleolar RNPs that modify pre-rRNAs, the telomerase RNP that maintains chromosome ends, and the microRNA/Argonaute complexes that modulate mRNA translation and stability (Hannon et al., 2006Hannon G.J. Rivas F.V. Murchison E.P. Steitz J.A. The expanding universe of noncoding RNAs.Cold Spring Harb. Symp. Quant. Biol. 2006; 71: 551-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). For each of these RNPs, the ncRNA moiety base pairs with nucleic acid targets to direct enzymatic activity to specific RNA and DNA sequences. For other RNPs, the ncRNA influences the function of bound proteins. For example, in the signal recognition particle (SRP), which mediates targeting of secretory and membrane proteins to plasma membranes, the ncRNA increases the interaction of SRP with its receptor and stimulates the GTPase activities of the SRP-receptor complex (Ataide et al., 2011Ataide S.F. Schmitz N. Shen K. Ke A. Shan S.O. Doudna J.A. Ban N. The crystal structure of the signal recognition particle in complex with its receptor.Science. 2011; 331: 881-886Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). In contrast to the many well-characterized RNPs, the function of Ro RNPs has been mysterious since their discovery (Lerner et al., 1981Lerner M.R. Boyle J.A. Hardin J.A. Steitz J.A. Two novel classes of small ribonucleoproteins detected by antibodies associated with lupus erythematosus.Science. 1981; 211: 400-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar). The major protein component, the ring-shaped Ro 60 kDa autoantigen, is a clinically important target of the immune response in patients with the rheumatic diseases systemic lupus erythematosus and Sjögren’s syndrome (Sim and Wolin, 2011Sim S. Wolin S.L. Emerging roles for the Ro 60-kDa autoantigen in noncoding RNA metabolism.Wiley Interdiscip Rev RNA. 2011; 2: 686-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Ro orthologs are present in most metazoans and approximately 5% of sequenced bacterial genomes (Perreault et al., 2007Perreault J. Perreault J.-P. Boire G. Ro-associated Y RNAs in metazoans: evolution and diversification.Mol. Biol. Evol. 2007; 24: 1678-1689Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar; Sim and Wolin, 2011Sim S. Wolin S.L. Emerging roles for the Ro 60-kDa autoantigen in noncoding RNA metabolism.Wiley Interdiscip Rev RNA. 2011; 2: 686-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Bacteria containing likely Ro orthologs are present in most phyla and include the radiation-resistant Deinococcus radiodurans and the human pathogens Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron and Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium (S. Typhimurium) (Sim and Wolin, 2011Sim S. Wolin S.L. Emerging roles for the Ro 60-kDa autoantigen in noncoding RNA metabolism.Wiley Interdiscip Rev RNA. 2011; 2: 686-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). In all studied organisms, Ro binds ncRNAs called Y RNAs. These ncRNAs, which are ∼100 nt in length, fold into secondary structures consisting of one or more large internal loops and a long stem that contains the Ro- binding site (Teunissen et al., 2000Teunissen S.W. Kruithof M.J. Farris A.D. Harley J.B. Venrooij W.J. Pruijn G.J. Conserved features of Y RNAs: a comparison of experimentally derived secondary structures.Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 610-619Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar; Sim and Wolin, 2011Sim S. Wolin S.L. Emerging roles for the Ro 60-kDa autoantigen in noncoding RNA metabolism.Wiley Interdiscip Rev RNA. 2011; 2: 686-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Many species contain between two and four distinct Y RNAs that differ largely in the sequences and sizes of the internal loops (Sim and Wolin, 2011Sim S. Wolin S.L. Emerging roles for the Ro 60-kDa autoantigen in noncoding RNA metabolism.Wiley Interdiscip Rev RNA. 2011; 2: 686-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Ro binding stabilizes Y RNAs from degradation (Labbé et al., 1999Labbé J.C. Hekimi S. Rokeach L.A. The levels of the RoRNP-associated Y RNA are dependent upon the presence of ROP-1, the Caenorhabditis elegans Ro60 protein.Genetics. 1999; 151: 143-150PubMed Google Scholar). Conversely, Y RNAs block a nuclear accumulation signal on Ro, retaining Ro in the cytoplasm (Sim et al., 2009Sim S. Weinberg D.E. Fuchs G. Choi K. Chung J. Wolin S.L. The subcellular distribution of an RNA quality control protein, the Ro autoantigen, is regulated by noncoding Y RNA binding.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2009; 20: 1555-1564Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Because the Ro protein also binds misfolded ncRNAs in some animal cell nuclei, it is proposed to function in ncRNA quality control (O’Brien and Wolin, 1994O’Brien C.A. Wolin S.L. A possible role for the 60-kD Ro autoantigen in a discard pathway for defective 5S rRNA precursors.Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 2891-2903Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar; Shi et al., 1996Shi H.

Human Y5 RNA specializes a Ro ribonucleoprotein for 5S ribosomal RNA quality control.Genes Dev. 2007; 21: 3067-3072Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Structural and biochemical studies revealed that Ro binds misfolded RNAs that contain both a 3′ single-stranded end and adjacent protein-free helices (Fuchs et al., 2006Fuchs G. Stein A.J. Fu C. Reinisch K.M. Wolin S.L. Structural and biochemical basis for misfolded RNA recognition by the Ro autoantigen.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2006; 13: 1002-1009Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The 3′ ends of these RNAs insert through the Ro ring, while helices contact the Ro outer surface. Because the binding of Ro to misfolded ncRNAs is largely sequence nonspecific, Ro may scavenge aberrant RNAs that fail to assemble with their correct RNA-binding proteins (Fuchs et al., 2006Fuchs G. Stein A.J. Fu C. Reinisch K.M. Wolin S.L. Structural and biochemical basis for misfolded RNA recognition by the Ro autoantigen.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2006; 13: 1002-1009Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). However, both the mechanism by which Ro affects misfolded RNA metabolism and whether Y RNAs contribute to this function are unknown. To have a genetically tractable system, we characterized Ro and a Y RNA in the first sequenced bacterium with a Ro ortholog, D. radiodurans (Chen et al., 2000Chen X. Quinn A.M. Wolin S.L. Ro ribonucleoproteins contribute to the resistance of Deinococcus radiodurans to ultraviolet irradiation.Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 777-782PubMed Google Scholar). These studies revealed that the ortholog ro sixty-related (Rsr) functions with 3′ to 5′ exoribonucleases during some types of environmental stress. Rsr and two exoribonucleases, RNase II and RNase PH, are required for efficient 23S rRNA maturation during heat stress (Chen et al., 2007Chen X. Wurtmann E.J. Van Batavia J. Zybailov B. Washburn M.P. Wolin S.L. An ortholog of the Ro autoantigen functions in 23S rRNA maturation in D. radiodurans.Genes Dev. 2007; 21: 1328-1339Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). In stationary phase, Rsr and the ring-shaped exoribonuclease polynucleotide phosphorylase (PNPase) are important for rRNA degradation (Wurtmann and Wolin, 2010Wurtmann E.J. Wolin S.L. A role for a bacterial ortholog of the Ro autoantigen in starvation-induced rRNA degradation.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2010; 107: 4022-4027Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Rsr and PNPase are found together in immunoprecipitates, and the sedimentation of PNPase with ribosomal subunits in stationary phase requires Rsr (Chen et al., 2007Chen X. Wurtmann E.J. Van Batavia J. Zybailov B. Washburn M.P. Wolin S.L. An ortholog of the Ro autoantigen functions in 23S rRNA maturation in D. radiodurans.Genes Dev. 2007; 21: 1328-1339Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar; Wurtmann and Wolin, 2010Wurtmann E.J.

However, the components of the putative Rsr/PNPase complex, the way in which Rsr influences PNPase activity, and whether Y RNA is involved have not been addressed. To understand how a Ro protein can influence the function of an exoribonuclease, we purified the Rsr/PNPase complex from D. radiodurans and examined its composition, molecular architecture, and activity. We report that Y RNA tethers Rsr to PNPase to form an RNA degradation machine. Single-particle electron microscopy (EM), followed by docking Ro and PNPase atomic structures into the three-dimensional reconstruction, is consistent with a model in which single-stranded RNA threads from the Rsr ring into the PNPase cavity. Biochemical experiments demonstrate that Rsr and Y RNA specialize PNPase for effective degradation of structured RNAs. Notably, a Ro ortholog and a ncRNA also associate with PNPase in an evolutionarily distant bacterium, S. Typhimurium. We discuss the similarities between the Rsr/Y RNA/PNPase RNP and other RNA degradation machines. To identify components of the Rsr/PNPase complex, we subjected a D. radiodurans strain in which Rsr and PNPase each carried a distinct epitope tag to two rounds of affinity purification. Rsr was fused to the IgG-binding domains of Staphylococcus aureus Protein A, while PNPase was fused to three copies of FLAG. After extracts were applied to IgG Sepharose, Rsr-containing complexes were eluted with TEV protease and applied to anti-FLAG agarose to isolate the Rsr/PNPase complex. Fractionation of the final eluate on glycerol gradients, followed by silver staining, revealed that the complex migrated at ∼300–450 kD and that the major components were Rsr and PNPase (Figure 1A). Northern analyses revealed that a Y RNA degradation fragment comigrated with the two proteins (Figure 1A). Because the apparent molecular size suggested that the complex consisted of Rsr (57 kD), one PNPase trimer (262 kD), and a Y RNA (42 kD), we attempted a reconstitution by coexpressing these components in E. coli, a bacterium that lacks a Ro ortholog. Epitope-tagged forms of Rsr and PNPase were expressed in E. coli in the presence or absence of Y RNA. Complex formation was only detected when Y RNA was coexpressed. After purification, the complex formed in E. coli migrated identically in glycerol gradients to the complex purified from D. radiodurans (Figure 1B). Thus, Rsr and PNPase form a stable complex that also contains Y RNA. Since Rsr and PNPase only associated when Y RNA was present, we hypothesized that Y RNA scaffolds the complex. To test this idea, we established an assay to evaluate how Rsr and PNPase interact via Y RNA. Rsr and PNPase were mixed with 32P-labeled Y RNA and the RNPs were separated from unbound RNA in nondenaturing gels. Rsr and PNPase each formed discrete RNPs with Y RNA (Figure 2A). When both Rsr and PNPase were present, a new RNP appeared that migrated more slowly than the two binary complexes (Figure 2A). As expected if Y RNA tethers Rsr to PNPase to form a ternary complex, this slowest migrating RNP failed to form in the presence of a mutant Rsr (Rsr-H189S) that does not bind Y RNA (Chen et al., 2007Chen X. Wurtmann E.J. Van Batavia J. Zybailov B. Washburn M.P. Wolin S.L. An ortholog of the Ro autoantigen functions in 23S rRNA maturation in D. radiodurans.Genes Dev. 2007; 21: 1328-1339Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) (Figure 2A). By excising the bands, fractionating the proteins in SDS-PAGE, and performing western blotting, we confirmed that the slowest migrating RNP contained both Rsr and PNPase (Figures S1A and S1B, available online).Figure S1Rsr and PNPase Interact Via the Y RNA, Related to Figure 2Show full caption(A) 32P-labeled D. radiodurans Y RNA was mixed with no protein (lanes 1 and 5), Rsr purified from either baculovirus-infected insect cells (lane 2) or E. coli (lane 6), PNPase (lanes 3 and 7) or both Rsr and PNPase (lanes 4 and 8) and fractionated in nondenaturing gels.(B) To confirm the identities of the RNPs, bands labeled a, b, c, d, and e were excised and subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blotting to detect Rsr and PNPase.

In vertebrates, Ro makes specific contacts with the 5′ strand of a conserved helix in a stem formed by base pairing the 5′ and 3′ Y RNA ends (Stein et al., 2005Stein A.J. Fuchs G. Fu C. Wolin S.L. Reinisch K.M. Structural insights into RNA quality control: the Ro autoantigen binds misfolded RNAs via its central cavity.Cell. 2005; 121: 529-539Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar) (Figure 2B). As expected if Rsr interacts similarly, a mutant Y RNA in which the conserved base pairs were reversed (Figure 2B, helix swap) did not bind Rsr or form the Rsr/Y RNA/PNPase RNP, although PNPase binding to the mutant RNA was unaffected (Figure 2C). A second feature of Y RNAs is the presence of one or more large internal loops (Teunissen et al., 2000Teunissen S.W. Kruithof M.J. Farris A.D. Harley J.B. Venrooij W.J. Pruijn G.J. Conserved features of Y RNAs: a comparison of experimentally derived secondary structures.Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 610-619Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar; Sim and Wolin, 2011Sim S. Wolin S.L. Emerging roles for the Ro 60-kDa autoantigen in noncoding RNA metabolism.Wiley Interdiscip Rev RNA. 2011; 2: 686-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) (Figure 2B). A Y RNA lacking these loops exhibited reduced PNPase binding and did not form the Rsr/Y RNA/PNPase RNP, although Rsr bound the truncated RNA indistinguishably from the full-length RNA (Figure 2D). The Y RNA loops probably interact with the K-homology (KH) and S1 domains of PNPase, since PNPases lacking either of these single-stranded RNA-binding domains (Lunde et al., 2007Lunde B.M. Moore C. Varani G. RNA-binding proteins: modular design for efficient function.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2007; 8: 479-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (872) Google Scholar) failed to bind Y RNA (Figure 2E), although the mutant proteins formed trimers similar to full-length PNPase as judged by fractionation in native gels and electron microscopy (Figure S1). Since mutations that reduce binding of either Rsr or PNPase to Y RNA impair complex formation, we conclude that Y RNA scaffolds the complex. We examined the structure of the Rsr/Y RNA/PNPase RNP by negative-stain EM. PNPase appeared as a homogeneous monodisperse globular particle with a central cavity and ∼100 Å diameter in the longest direction in raw micrographs (Figure S1F). Two-dimensional class averages showed a large ring-shaped particle containing three major domains of density with 3-fold symmetry (Figure 3A). Since the Rsr/Y RNA/PNPase RNP dissociated under the conditions used for negative-stain EM, with particles corresponding to PNPase and smaller ring-like particles in the size and shape of Rsr (Ramesh et al., 2007Ramesh A. Savva C.G. Holzenburg A. Sacchettini J.C. Crystal structure of Rsr, an ortholog of the antigenic Ro protein, links conformational flexibility to RNA binding activity.J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 14960-14967Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar) easily recognizable in raw micrographs, we used the GraFix method (Kastner et al., 2008Kastner B. Fischer N. Golas M.M. Sander B. Dube P. Boehringer D. Hartmuth K. Deckert J. Hauer F. Wolf E. et al.GraFix: sample preparation for single-particle electron cryomicroscopy.Nat. Methods. 2008; 5: 53-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar) to improve recovery. The use of GraFix, which involves a final purification step of sedimenting the complex through a double gradient of glutaraldehyde and glycerol, improved the homogeneity of the RNP dramatically. Large globular particles similar to PNPase but containing a marked additional density and a total longest diameter of ∼140–150 Å appeared (Figure S2A). The majority of the two-dimensional class averages of the Rsr/Y RNA/PNPase RNP appeared as a small ring connected to a larger ring (Figures 3A and S2B). No differences were observed between native PNPase and PNPase in the GraFix-prepared RNP (Figure 3A), indicating that the GraFix method does not affect PNPase structure.Figure S2Single-particle EM of the Rsr/Y RNA/PNPase RNP, Related to Figure 3Show full caption(A) Representative raw electron micrograph tilt-pairs of negatively stained Rsr/Y RNA/PNPase complexes.

In agreement with the reference-free two-dimensional class averages, the reconstruction showed a small elongated ring-shaped density positioned at an angle almost directly above the central channel of the larger ring-shaped structure. The smaller and larger densities have the sizes and shapes of Rsr (Ramesh et al., 2007Ramesh A. Savva C.G. Holzenburg A. Sacchettini J.C.

There is an additional rod-shaped density that forms the major connection between the two rings along one side, which may represent Y RNA. By docking atomic models of Rsr and PNPase into the EM map, we obtained a model for the complex (Figure 3C). The smaller ring accommodates the crystal structure of Rsr (Ramesh et al., 2007Ramesh A. Savva C.G. Holzenburg A. Sacchettini J.C. Crystal structure of Rsr, an ortholog of the antigenic Ro protein, links conformational flexibility to RNA binding activity.J. Biol.

Structural insights into RNA quality control: the Ro autoantigen binds misfolded RNAs via its central cavity.Cell. 2005; 121: 529-539Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). The Rsr structure (PDB 2NVO) more closely resembles the size and shape of the smaller ring-shaped density and could be docked into the map with the highest cross-correlation coefficient (0.939). Because a X. laevis Ro structure included a Y RNA fragment (Stein et al., 2005Stein A.J. Fuchs G. Fu C. Wolin S.L. Reinisch K.M. Structural insights into RNA quality control: the Ro autoantigen binds misfolded RNAs via its central cavity.Cell. 2005; 121: 529-539Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar), we used this structure (PDB 1YVP) for final modeling by superimposing its coordinates onto the Rsr structure already deposited into the EM density. This orientation places one end of the Y RNA fragment, corresponding to the 5′ and 3′ termini of the intact RNA, in close proximity to one of the KH and S1 domains of the PNPase trimer (Figure 3C). The Y RNA fragment used for crystallization (Stein et al., 2005Stein A.J. Fuchs G. Fu C. Wolin S.L. Reinisch K.M. Structural insights into RNA quality control: the Ro autoantigen binds misfolded RNAs via its central cavity.Cell. 2005; 121: 529-539Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar) contains only the part of the stem encompassing the conserved helix, and we propose that the remainder of the stem and the distal loops continue along the Ro surface and across the rod-shaped density to allow the loops to contact a second KH/S1 domain of PNPase, thus anchoring the two protein components (Figures 3D and 3E). To examine how the Rsr/Y RNA/PNPase RNP could interact with substrates, we superimposed the coordinates of X. laevis Ro bound to a misfolded RNA fragment (PDB 2I91; Fuchs et al., 2006Fuchs G. Stein A.J. Fu C. Reinisch K.M. Wolin S.L. Structural and biochemical basis for misfolded RNA recognition by the Ro autoantigen.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2006; 13: 1002-1009Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) onto the structure of Ro deposited into the EM density. In this structure, the single-stranded 3′ end of the misfolded RNA passes through the Ro cavity, while a duplex binds on the outer surface (Fuchs et al., 2006Fuchs G. Stein A.J. Fu C. Reinisch K.M.

https://openalex.org/W1977374839,"Posttranslational lipidation provides critical modulation of the functions of some proteins. Isoprenoids (i.e., farnesyl or geranylgeranyl groups) are attached to cysteine residues in proteins containing C-terminal CAAX sequence motifs (where A is an aliphatic residue and X is any residue). Isoprenylation is followed by cleavage of the AAX amino acid residues and, in some cases, by additional proteolytic cuts. We determined the crystal structure of the CAAX protease Ste24p, a zinc metalloprotease catalyzing two proteolytic steps in the maturation of yeast mating pheromone a-factor. The Ste24p core structure is a ring of seven transmembrane helices enclosing a voluminous cavity containing the active site and substrate-binding groove. The cavity is accessible to the external milieu by means of gaps between splayed transmembrane helices. We hypothesize that cleavage proceeds by means of a processive mechanism of substrate insertion, translocation, and ejection."
https://openalex.org/W1995082720,"While it is commonly assumed that decisions taken slowly result in superior outcomes, is it possible that optimal decision making does not always require sacrificing speed? For odor categorization decisions, it was previously shown that rats use <300 ms regardless of difficulty, but these findings could be interpreted as a tradeoff of accuracy for speed. Here, by systematically manipulating the task contingencies, we demonstrate that this is the maximum time over which sampling time can improve accuracy. Furthermore, we show that decision accuracy increases at no temporal cost when rats can better anticipate either the identity of stimuli or the required timing of responses. These experiments suggest that uncertainty in odor category decisions arises from noise sources that fluctuate slowly from trial-to-trial rather than rapidly within trials and that category decisions in other species and modalities might likewise be optimally served by rapid choices."

Rather, HDACis that could reactivate HIV in chromatin or on episomal plasmids also released free positive transcription elongation factor b (P-TEFb) from its inhibitory 7SK snRNP. In resting primary CD4(+) T cells, where levels of P-TEFb are vanishingly low, the most potent HDACi, suberoylanilide hydroxyamic acid (SAHA), had minimal effects. In contrast, when these cells were treated with a PKC agonist, bryostatin 1, which increased levels of P-TEFb, then SAHA once again reactivated HIV. We conclude that HDACis, which can reactivate HIV, work via the release of free P-TEFb from the 7SK snRNP."
https://openalex.org/W2148579955,"The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) regulates cell growth by integrating nutrient and growth factor signaling and is strongly implicated in cancer. But mTOR is not an oncogene, and which tumors will be resistant or sensitive to new adenosine triphosphate (ATP) competitive mTOR inhibitors now in clinical trials remains unknown. We screened a panel of over 600 human cancer cell lines to identify markers of resistance and sensitivity to the mTOR inhibitor PP242. RAS and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase catalytic subunit alpha (PIK3CA) mutations were the most significant genetic markers for resistance and sensitivity to PP242, respectively; colon origin was the most significant marker for resistance based on tissue type. Among colon cancer cell lines, those with KRAS mutations were most resistant to PP242, whereas those without KRAS mutations most sensitive. Surprisingly, cell lines with co-mutation of PIK3CA and KRAS had intermediate sensitivity. Immunoblot analysis of the signaling targets downstream of mTOR revealed that the degree of cellular growth inhibition induced by PP242 was correlated with inhibition of phosphorylation of the translational repressor eIF4E-binding protein 1 (4E-BP1), but not ribosomal protein S6 (rpS6). In a tumor growth inhibition trial of PP242 in patient-derived colon cancer xenografts, resistance to PP242-induced inhibition of 4E-BP1 phosphorylation and xenograft growth was again observed in KRAS mutant tumors without PIK3CA co-mutation, compared with KRAS wild-type controls. We show that, in the absence of PIK3CA co-mutation, KRAS mutations are associated with resistance to PP242 and that this is specifically linked to changes in the level of phosphorylation of 4E-BP1."

However, the mechanisms by which it impacts breast cancer have not been elucidated. We hypothesized a role for IMP3 in chemoresistance based on these observations. Depletion of IMP3 expression in triple-negative breast cancer cells increased their sensitivity to doxorubicin and mitoxantrone significantly but not to taxol. Given that doxorubicin and mitoxantrone are effluxed by breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP), we assessed whether IMP3 regulates BCRP. The data obtained demonstrate that IMP3 binds to BCRP mRNA and regulates BCRP expression. These findings are significant because they provide insight into the mechanism by which IMP3 contributes to aggressive cancers, and they highlight the potential for targeting this mRNA-binding protein for the clinical management of cancer.

https://openalex.org/W2085546128,"Estrogen receptor-alpha (ERα) is an important biomarker used to classify and direct therapy decisions in breast cancer (BC). Both ERα protein and its transcript, ESR1, are used to predict response to tamoxifen therapy, yet certain tumors have discordant levels of ERα protein and ESR1, which is currently unexplained. Cellular ERα protein levels can be controlled post-translationally by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway through a mechanism that depends on phosphorylation at residue S118. Phospho-S118 (pS118-ERα) is a substrate for the peptidyl prolyl isomerase, Pin1, which mediates cis-trans isomerization of the pS118-P119 bond to enhance ERα transcriptional function. Here, we demonstrate that Pin1 can increase ERα protein without affecting ESR1 transcript levels by inhibiting proteasome-dependent receptor degradation. Pin1 disrupts ERα ubiquitination by interfering with receptor interactions with the E3 ligase, E6AP, which also is shown to bind pS118-ERα. Quantitative in situ assessments of ERα protein, ESR1, and Pin1 in human tumors from a retrospective cohort show that Pin1 levels correlate with ERα protein but not to ESR1 levels. These data show that ERα protein is post-translationally regulated by Pin1 in a proportion of breast carcinomas. As Pin1 impacts both ERα protein levels and transactivation function, these data implicate Pin1 as a potential surrogate marker for predicting outcome of ERα-positive BC."

Methionine adenosyltransferase (MAT) synthesizes S-adenosylmethionine (AdoMet), which is utilized as a methyl donor in transmethylation reactions involving histones. MATIIα, a MAT isozyme, serves as a transcriptional corepressor in the oxidative stress response and forms the AdoMet-integrating transcription regulation module, affecting histone methyltransferase activities. However, the identities of genes regulated by MATIIα or its associated methyltransferases are unclear. We show that MATIIα represses the expression of cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2), encoded by Ptgs2, by specifically interacting with histone H3K9 methyltransferase SETDB1, thereby promoting the trimethylation of H3K9 at the COX-2 locus. We discuss both gene-specific and epigenome-wide functions of MATIIα."
https://openalex.org/W2066700296,"Adipose fat storage is thought to require uptake of circulating triglyceride (TG)-derived fatty acids via lipoprotein lipase (LpL). To determine how LpL affects the biology of adipose tissue, we created adipose-specific LpL knock-out (ATLO) mice, and we compared them with whole body LpL knock-out mice rescued with muscle LpL expression (MCK/L0) and wild type (WT) mice. ATLO LpL mRNA and activity were reduced, respectively, 75 and 70% in gonadal adipose tissue (GAT), 90 and 80% in subcutaneous tissue, and 84 and 85% in brown adipose tissue (BAT). ATLO mice had increased plasma TG levels associated with reduced chylomicron TG uptake into BAT and lung. ATLO BAT, but not GAT, had altered TG composition. GAT from MCK/L0 was smaller and contained less polyunsaturated fatty acids in TG, although GAT from ATLO was normal unless LpL was overexpressed in muscle. High fat diet feeding led to less adipose in MCK/L0 mice but TG acyl composition in subcutaneous tissue and BAT reverted to that of WT. Therefore, adipocyte LpL in BAT modulates plasma lipoprotein clearance, and the greater metabolic activity of this depot makes its lipid composition more dependent on LpL-mediated uptake. Loss of adipose LpL reduces fat accumulation only if accompanied by greater LpL activity in muscle. These data support the role of LpL as the ""gatekeeper"" for tissue lipid distribution."

The death domain-associated protein DAXX can be either a pro-apoptotic or an anti-apoptotic factor, depending on the cell type and context. In this study, we found that DAXX was highly expressed in human ovarian surface epithelial tumors but not in granulosa cell tumors. In cultured ovarian cancer cells, DAXX interacted with promyelocytic leukemia protein (PML) and localized to subnuclear domains (so-called PML nuclear bodies). A role for DAXX in ovarian cancer cell proliferation, metastasis, and radio/chemoresistance was examined. Overexpression of DAXX enhanced multiple ovarian cancer cell lines' proliferation, colony formation, and migration, whereas Daxx depletion by RNA interference had the opposite effects. When transplanted into nude mice, ovarian cancer cells that overexpressed DAXX displayed enhanced tumorigenesis capability in vivo, whereas Daxx depletion inhibited tumor development. Importantly, Daxx induced tumorigenic transformation of normal ovarian surface epithelial cells. Daxx also protected ovarian cancer cells against x-irradiation- and chemotherapy-induced DNA damage by interacting with PML.

Chemoresistance remains a major hurdle to successful treatment. Recent evidence indicates that the inability of cancer cells to undergo apoptosis is a key determinant of chemotherapy resistance. Dysregulation of pro-apoptotic mediators, such as FAS, caspases, and p53, and anti-apoptotic pathways, such as AKT, X-linked IAP, and FAS-associated death domain-like interleukin-1b-converting enzyme-like inhibitory protein pathways, has been demonstrated in chemoresistant cells (2Abedini M.R.

DAXX was initially identified as a pro-apoptotic protein that bound to the death domain of the CD95 death receptor. By activating the c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase pathway, DAXX was shown to enhance both CD95-mediated and transforming growth factor-β-dependent apoptosis (4Yang X. Khosravi-Far R. Chang H.Y.

Interestingly, Daxx down-regulation by RNA interference was also associated with increased apoptosis (5Chen L.Y. Chen J.D. Daxx silencing sensitizes cells to multiple apoptotic pathways.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 7108-7121Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Moreover, targeted disruption of the murine Daxx gene resulted in embryonic lethality due to extensive global apoptosis, which suggested that DAXX could also have anti-apoptotic effects (6Michaelson J.S.

Aside from its controversial role in apoptosis, DAXX is a well established transcription regulator. DAXX can interact with several crucial proteins involved in transcriptional silencing, such as histone deacetylases HDAC1 and HDAC2 and DNA methyltransferase DNMT1. DAXX represses the activity of several transcriptional factors, including C/EBPβ, c-Met, Pax3, Ets1, p53, and its family members p73 and p63, glucocorticoid receptor, androgen receptor, and SMAD4 (7Salomoni P.

Consistent with its involvement in transcriptional regulation, DAXX is predominantly a nuclear protein. In the nucleus, it primarily localizes to subnuclear structures, so-called PML-oncogenic domains (PODs), by binding to SUMO-modified PML. Promyelocytic leukemia (PML) protein nuclear bodies (NBs) are macromolecular nuclear domains that are found in virtually all mammalian cells (12Yeung P.L. Chen L.Y. Tsai S.C. Zhang A. Chen J.D. Daxx contains two nuclear localization signals and interacts with importin α3.J. Cell. Biochem. 2008; 103: 456-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). PML nuclear bodies (PML-NBs) have been functionally linked to various fundamental cellular processes, including transcriptional control, tumor suppression, and apoptosis regulation (13Takahashi Y. Lallemand-Breitenbach V. Zhu J. de Thé H. PML nuclear bodies and apoptosis.Oncogene. 2004; 23: 2819-2824Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). In support of the important role of PML and its associated NBs in apoptosis regulation, several apoptotic regulators localize to PML-NBs, and cells from PML-deficient mice display severe apoptotic defects (14Hofmann T.G. Will H. Body language: the function of PML nuclear bodies in apoptosis regulation.Cell Death Differ. 2003; 10: 1290-1299Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). However, the possible involvement of DAXX and PML in the proliferation and apoptosis of ovarian cancer cells has not been examined. Thus, in this study, we used both ovarian cancer cells and normal ovarian surface epithelial (OSE) cells to investigate the involvement of DAXX and PML in proliferation, metastasis, and DNA damage-induced responses. We found that DAXX and PML were highly expressed in human ovarian cancer tissues and that they enhanced tumor growth, cell migration, colony formation, and resistance to DNA damage insults both in vitro and in vivo. In addition, DAXX overexpression caused the tumorigenic transformation of normal OSE cells and thus acted as an ovarian cancer oncogene. These results suggest that modulating DAXX-PML nuclear body activity may be an effective strategy for preventing the recurrence and chemoresistance of ovarian cancers.

Mice were housed with a 14:10 h, light/dark schedule and provided food and water ad libitum. All animal protocols were in accordance with the National Institutes of Health Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. To assess proliferation and metastasis, ovarian cancer cells were injected subcutaneously or intraperitoneally into 8-week-old female athymic nude mice. Four weeks later, primary tumor masses were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and embedded in paraffin. Sections (5 μm thick) were prepared and stained with hematoxylin and eosin. Expression constructs encoding for full-length Daxx (pLEGFP-Daxx and HA-Daxx) were kindly provided by Dr. K. N. Klempnauer (9Wethkamp N. Klempnauer K.H.

Briefly, cells were seeded in 60-mm dishes and transfected with 4 μg of pLEGFP-Daxx or pSuper-shDaxx plasmids using Lipofectamine 2000. Cells with EGFP fluorescence were selected and cultured in complete cell culture medium along with either G418 (200 μg/ml) or puromycin (1 μg/ml) for 7–10 days. Cells were cultured using the method of Hamburger and Salmon (17Tveit K.M. Kaern J. Hoifodt H.K. Pettersen E.O. Abeler V. Davy M. Hannisdal E. Trope C.

One-milliliter layers of 0.5% agar were prepared in a 35-mm cell culture dish (Corning). Cells to be tested were suspended in 1 ml of 0.35% agar containing 1× cell culture medium and 10% fetal bovine serum and poured over these underlayers. The final cell concentration in each culture was 6 × 103 cells/ml. Triplicate cultures were used for each experiment. The plates were placed in a 5% CO2 humidified incubator at 37 °C. Colonies were counted at 6 weeks after plating using an Omnicon FAS II Image Analysis System. ES-2 cells (sh-control and shDaxx- and GFP-DAXX-expressing cells) were grown to confluence in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS. Then the medium was changed to FBS-free DMEM, and the cell monolayers were scraped in a straight line using a P-200 pipette tip to create a “scratch wound.” The plates were photographed at 0 and 24 h using a phase contrast inverted microscope (Nikon Ti, Nikon Corp.). Twenty four-well tissue culture plate inserts with 8-μm pore filters and BioCoat Matrigel (BD Biosciences) were used to assess the migration and invasive potential of ES-2 cells that had been stably transfected with either control siRNA, shDaxx, or GFP-Daxx. Cells were suspended in serum-free medium, and then added to a transwell (100-μl cell suspension/well at a concentration of 0.5–1 × 105 cells/ml). After incubation for 24 h at 37 °C, cells at the upper surface of the transwell were removed with cotton swabs. Cells that had migrated were attached to the lower surface and were stained with hematoxylin and eosin. Transwells were rinsed with water and air-dried. Positive cells were quantified using Image-Pro Plus 6.0 software. ES-2 cells (sh-control and shDaxx- and GFP-Daxx-expressing cells) were seeded in 96-well plates at 3 × 103/well in DMEM containing 10% FBS. After they adhered, cells were treated with 5 μg/ml bleomycin for 24 h and assessed for growth using an MTT assay. Briefly, 20 μl of MTT solution (5 mg/ml in PBS) was added into triplicate wells, and cells were incubated for 4–6 h in an incubator. Absorbance at 490 nm was read with a microplate reader. Total RNA was isolated from tissues or cultured cells using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's protocols. Total RNA (5 μg) was reverse-transcribed using a cDNA synthesis kit (Bio-Rad). The following primers were used to amplify target genes: actin, 5′-GCTCTTTTCCAGCCTTCCTT-3′; 5′-GTACTTGCGCTCAGGAGGAG-3′; Daxx, 5′-TCTACAACTTTGGCTGTCACCTC-3′; 5′-GTCTCTTCTGTCTCTCGCCCT-3′; and Pml, 5′-GCTGACCCCCAAGCAGAAGA-3′; 5′-CTCAGAAAGCTGAGGAAGTGCTG-3′. Paraffin-embedded human tissues from ovarian tumors and normal ovaries were provided by the Second Hospital of Jiaxing and the Jiaxing Maternity and Child Health Care Hospital, China. The use of archived cancer samples in this study was approved by the Zhejiang University Institutional Review Board. Sections were cut with a Leica RM2235 microtome at 5 μm thicknesses and stained with affinity-purified anti-DAXX (Sigma) and anti-PML (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) antibodies for immunohistochemistry using a Vector ABC kit (Vector Laboratories). Briefly, sections were deparaffinized, rehydrated, and incubated in 0.3% H2O2. After antigen retrieval using 10 mm sodium citrate (pH 6.0), sections were incubated in normal goat serum. The samples were then probed with primary antibodies. After washing with PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20 (PBS-T), samples were incubated with a secondary antibody and washed again with PBS-T before incubation with ABC solution. Color was developed with a diaminobenzidine substrate kit (Vector Laboratories). The sections were washed, counterstained, dehydrated, and mounted with VectaMount permanent mounting medium (Vector Laboratories). Sections were viewed under a Nikon Eclipse 80i Microscope (Nikon Corp.). Staining intensity for DAXX and PML was scored by a pathologist (L. Guo). Tumor tissues were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, embedded in O.C.T. compound (Sakura Finetek USA Inc.), and stored at −80 °C before preparing 7-μm sections using a Leica CM1850 cryomicrotome (Leica Microsystems, Wetzlar, Germany). Cultured cells were seeded on coverslips and transfected with the desired plasmids. 24 h later, cells were washed with PBS, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, permeabilized with PBS containing 0.3% Triton X-100 (PBST), and incubated with blocking buffer (PBST containing 5% bovine serum albumin). Sections or cells were sequentially probed with primary antibodies as indicated under “Results” and Alexa Fluor 594- or 488-conjugated secondary antibodies (Molecular Probes). Slides were mounted using VectaShield with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI, Vector Laboratories). Digital images were acquired using an epifluorescence microscope (Nikon Eclipse 80i) with 4–100× objectives. Cell extracts containing 30 μg of protein were resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred to PVDF membranes (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA). After probing with primary antibodies, the membranes were incubated with horseradish peroxidase-linked anti-rabbit antibodies (Cell Signaling Technologies, Danvers, MA) and then washed. Bound antibodies were visualized using an enhanced chemiluminescence detection kit (Amersham Biosciences). The primary antibodies were as follows: DAXX (Sigma), p-H2AX (Ser-139), p-CHK1 (Ser-345), p-Chk2 (Thr-68), p-histone H3 (Ser-10), cleave caspase 3, β-actin (Cell Signaling), p27, GFP, PML (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and collagen IV (Abcam). All in vitro assays were performed in triplicate. Groups were compared by two-tailed t tests or analysis of variance using GraphPad Prism statistical programs (GraphPad Prism, San Diego). p < 0.05 was considered significant. DAXX protein expression in human tissues was assessed by immunohistochemistry. As shown in Fig. 1, A and B (left panels), DAXX was weakly expressed in normal ovarian tissue. Significant DAXX staining intensity was detected in endometrioid carcinoma (92.3%), serous cystadenoma (91.7%), clear cell carcinoma (100%), and mucinous cystadenoma (100%), whereas DAXX was only weakly expressed in granular cell tumor tissues (0%) (Table 1). The subcellular localization of DAXX was also examined in ovarian cancer cell lines. DAXX was localized in nuclei and formed nuclear foci in most ovarian cancer cell lines (ES-2, C13, SKOV-3, and A2780; Fig. 1C). Interestingly, more cytoplasmic DAXX signals were detected in immortalized ovarian surface epithelial cells (mOSE) and HeLa cervical cancer cells.TABLE 1DAXX protein expression in ovarian cancer and normal ovary tissuesPathological classificationTotal patientsCases with high levels of DAXX expressionN (patients)%Normal ovary tissue300Serous cystadenoma363391.7Endometrioid carcinoma131292.3Clear cell carcinoma33100Mucinous cystadenoma44100Granular cell tumor300 Open table in a new tab The relative Daxx mRNA expression levels in ovarian cancer cells and other ovarian cell types were determined by real time PCR. Daxx mRNA was highly expressed in human ovarian cancer cells, mOSE cells, and oocytes, but it was weakly expressed in granulosa cells, the most abundant cell type in the ovary (Fig. 1D). At the protein level, as compared with other tissues, DAXX was highly expressed in reproductive organs (uterus, testis, and ovary; Fig. 1E). The expressions of Daxx mRNA and protein at high levels in ovarian cancer tissues and ovarian cancer cell lines suggested that Daxx could play an essential role in ovarian tumor cell proliferation and migration. To investigate a role for Daxx in ovarian cancer cells, we developed ovarian cancer cell lines (ES-2) that stably expressed shRNA that targeted Daxx sequences (designated shRNA2 and shRNA3). Daxx was efficiently knocked down in these cell lines, as shown by quantitative real time PCR and Western blot (Fig. 1F). We also developed ovarian cancer cell lines that stably overexpressed GFP-tagged DAXX. GFP-DAXX fusion protein expression and its nuclear localization were established by Western blotting and immunofluorescence, respectively (Fig. 1, G and H). First, we investigated roles for Daxx in the survival, proliferation, and migration of ovarian cancer cells. As shown in Fig. 2A, GFP-DAXX-overexpressing ES-2 cells grew faster than control cells, whereas Daxx silencing remarkably reduced cell growth as assessed by MTT assays. In addition, Daxx silencing remarkably inhibited the growth of other human ovarian cancer cell lines, including OV2008 and SKOV3 (data not shown). Furthermore, DAXX overexpression in ES-2 and SKOV3 cells significantly promoted colony formation in soft agar and increased the sizes of these colonies (Fig. 2, B and C). Immunofluorescent staining and Western blotting of cleaved caspase 3 (Fig. 2, D and E) indicated that the numbers of apoptotic cells were dramatically increased after RNAi depletion of Daxx or Pml. We also generated mock stable cell lines (expressing GFP) as the control when we studied overexpressed GFP-DAXX. GFP-expressing ovarian cancer cells did not show any differences from nontransfected cells in cell growth and clone formation assays (supplemental Fig. 1). The effect of Daxx on ovarian cancer cell migration was also determined. Using a scratch wound assay, DAXX overexpression noticeably promoted the migration of ES-2 cells, whereas Daxx silencing inhibited the migration of these cells (Fig. 2F). In another experiment, we examined Daxx-stimulated ovarian cancer ES-2 cells' metastatic potential using a transwell assay. The migration of ES-2 cells was increased by 2-fold due to DAXX overexpression, but it was significantly decreased by Daxx silencing (Fig. 2G). These results demonstrated that Daxx was required for ovarian cancer cell proliferation and migration. We also investigated roles for Daxx in ovarian cancer cell proliferation and metastasis in vivo. Female athymic nude mice were injected intraperitoneally with either control ES-2 cells or ES-2 cells that stably expressed GFP-DAXX (ES-2+Daxx) or Daxx-shRNA (ES-2 shDaxx). Nude mice that received ES-2+Daxx cells showed visible abdominal distention and had accumulated large amounts of ascites at 30 days (Fig. 3A). These ascites cells were harvested and cultured in standard DMEM containing 10% FBS. Cytological examination revealed that most of these ascites cells were positive for GFP (Fig. 3B), which indicated that they were derived from the transplanted ES-2+Daxx cells. These cells could be grown and passaged indefinitely in vitro (data not shown). In addition, the weights of the abdominal solid tumors formed by ES-2+Daxx cells were 3-fold greater than the weights of control tumors formed by the original ES-2 cells (Fig. 3A). In contrast, RNAi silencing of Daxx dramatically inhibited the growth of these transplanted cancer cells (Fig. 3A). Examining the peritoneal cavities of mice that had received ES-2+Daxx cells revealed dramatic, diffuse studding of tumor deposits on the liver and intestine (Fig. 3C). By comparison, control ES-2 cells resulted in the formation of fewer diffuse colonies in these tissues. In addition, Daxx-depleted ES-2 cells failed to form any metastasized colonies in the peritoneal cavity (Fig. 3C). Immunohistochemical examination confirmed that DAXX and PML were highly expressed in ES-2+Daxx tumors, but their expressions were dramatically decreased in ES-2 shDaxx tumors (Fig. 3F). Significant cell proliferation was only detected in ES-2-Daxx tumors by immunostaining for phosphohistone H3. However, ES-2 shDaxx tumors contained noticeable amounts of apoptotic cells, as shown by immunostaining for cleaved caspase 3 (Fig. 3F). To assess the effect of Daxx on tumor cell growth, we next implanted ES-2 and ES-2+Daxx cells and SKOV3 and SKOV3+Daxx cells subcutaneously into the left and right flanks of nude mice, respectively. As shown in Fig. 3D, tumors that formed due to Daxx-overexpressing cells were significantly larger than those formed due to control cells. Fluorescent microscopy for GFP confirmed that the majority of the tumor cells were derived from GFP-DAXX-expressing cells (Fig. 3E). The tumor tissues were co-stained with an antibody against collagen IV to demonstrate tumor angiogenesis. Taken together, these results demonstrated that Daxx was required for growth and metastasis in vivo of ovarian cancer cells. To determine whether Daxx overexpression could also induce tumor formation by normal OSE cells, we generated an immortalized mouse OSE cell line that stably expressed GFP-DAXX (Fig. 4A). Then mOSE cells, with or without Daxx overexpression, were subcutaneously implanted into the flanks of nude mice. As shown in Fig. 4, B and C, after 60 days, tumor formation was detected in the mice that had received mOSE+Daxx cells but not in control mice that had received normal mOSE cells. DAXX and PML proteins were highly expressed in tumor xenografts, as determined by immunohistochemistry (Fig. 4D). The cell proliferation marker phosphohistone H3 and the endothelial cell marker collagen IV were also highly expressed in tumor xenografts (Fig. 4E), which indicated that the grafted tissue was highly proliferative and angiogenic. These results suggested that Daxx possessed oncogenic characteristics in normal OSE cells; when overexpressed, Daxx could induce tumorigenic transformation in this cell type. Cellular resistance to radiotherapy and chemotherapy remains one of the greatest unresolved problems in treating ovarian cancer. Previous reports suggested that Daxx participated in DNA damage signaling in apoptosis (18Tang J. Qu L.K. Zhang J. Wang W. Michaelson J.S. Degenhardt Y.Y. El-Deiry W.S. Yang X. Critical role for Daxx in regulating Mdm2.Nat. Cell Biol. 2006; 8: 855-862Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). H2AX and CHK1/2 phosphorylation is an essential early step in DNA damage responses. X-ray irradiation induced dramatic DNA damage responses in ES-2 cells, as demonstrated by immunostaining for phospho-H2AX (pH2AX) and phospho-CHK2 (pCHK2; Fig. 5A). However, cells that were transfected with siDaxx had high levels of pH2AX and pCHK2, even without x-ray irradiation (Fig. 5, B–D). Furthermore, when exposed to x-ray irradiation, GFP-DAXX-overexpressing cells displayed less H2AX/CHK2 phosphorylation than the adjacent GFP-DAXX negative cells, whereas Daxx knockdown cells displayed more dramatic H2AX/CHK2 phosphorylation than the control cells in the same fields of view (Fig. 5, B–D). Western blotting analysis also showed that pH2AX levels were decreased by Daxx overexpression before and after x-ray irradiation (Fig. 5E). Next, we examined the time-dependent effect of DAXX on x-ray irradiation-induced DNA damage. As expected, x-ray irradiation induced rapid DNA damage within 5 min (data not shown). DAXX overexpression in ES-2 cells significantly suppressed x-ray irradiation-induced H2AX and CHK1 phosphorylation at all time points examined (Fig. 5F). In contrast, Daxx RNAi further enhanced H2AX/CHK1 phosphorylation after x-ray irradiation (Fig. 5G). Taken together, these results suggested that Daxx protected ovarian cancer cells from DNA damage after exposure to x-ray irradiation. Because of its known cellular effect of causing DNA double strand breaks, the widely used chemotherapy drug BLM (20 μg/ml) also induced dramatic H2AX and CHK2 phosphorylation in ovarian cancer cells (Fig. 6A). In addition, DAXX and PML nuclear foci dramatically increased after BLM treatment in a time-dependent manner (Fig. 6, B and C). Immunostaining for pH2AX, pCHK2, and PML in GFP-Daxx-expressing ES-2 cells indicated that pH2AX and pCHK2 partially co-localized with DAXX after DNA damage (Fig. 6A) and that PML co-localized with DAXX in most nuclear foci (Fig. 6B). An ∼4-fold increase in PML foci was detected at 12 h after BLM treatment (Fig. 6C). In addition, DAXX and PML protein levels were notably increased in ES-2 cells after BLM treatment (Fig. 6D). These results suggest that DAXX-PML nuclear bodies are highly dynamic and increase after DNA damage. The subcellular distribution of PML was almost similar to that of DAXX in these ovarian cancer cell lines (supplemental Fig. 1D). Because DAXX co-localized with PML in ovarian cancer cells during DNA damage responses, we investigated the PML protein expression in normal mouse ovary and human ovarian tumor tissue by immunohistochemistry. As shown in Fig. 6E, PML was weakly expressed in the surface epithelium of mouse ovary and in human granular cell tumors. However, significant PML expression was detected in all OSE cancer sample"

Identification of molecular pathways and modulators controlling inflammatory migration could lead to therapeutic strategies for treating human inflammation-associated diseases. The role of cannabinoid receptor type 2 (Cnr2) in regulating immune function had been widely investigated, but the mechanism is not fully understood. Through a chemical genetic screen using a zebrafish model for leukocyte migration, we found that both an agonist of the Cnr2 and inhibitor of the 5-lipoxygenase (Alox5, encoded by alox5) inhibit leukocyte migration in response to acute injury. These agents have a similar effect on migration of human myeloid cells. Consistent with these results, we found that inactivation of Cnr2 by zinc finger nuclease-mediated mutagenesis enhances leukocyte migration, while inactivation of Alox5 blocks leukocyte migration. Further investigation indicates that there is a signaling link between Cnr2 and Alox5 and that alox5 is a target of c-Jun. Cnr2 activation down-regulates alox5 expression by suppressing the JNK/c-Jun activation. These studies demonstrate that Cnr2, JNK, and Alox5 constitute a pathway regulating leukocyte migration. The cooperative effect between the Cnr2 agonist and Alox5 inhibitor also provides a potential therapeutic strategy for treating human inflammation-associated diseases.

https://openalex.org/W2048425686,"HIV-1 infection causes chronic neuroinflammation in the central nervous system (CNS).The spinal cytokine up-regulation induced by HIV-1 gp120 protein depends on Wnt5a/CaMKII and/or Wnt5a/JNK pathways.gp120 stimulates cytokine expression in the spinal cord dorsal horn by activating Wnt5a signaling.The finding reveals Wnt signaling-mediated novel mechanisms by which HIV-1 may cause neuroinflammation. Chronic expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines critically contributes to the pathogenesis of HIV-associated neurological disorders (HANDs), but the host mechanism that regulates the HIV-induced cytokine expression in the CNS remains elusive. Here, we present evidence for a crucial role of Wnt5a signaling in the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines in the spinal cord induced by a major HIV-envelope protein, gp120. Wnt5a is mainly expressed in spinal neurons, and rapidly up-regulated by intrathecal injection (i.t.) of gp120. We show that inhibition of Wnt5a by specific antagonists blocks gp120-induced up-regulation of IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α in the spinal cord. Conversely, injection (i.t.) of purified recombinant Wnt5a stimulates the expression of these cytokines. To elucidate the role of the Wnt5a-regulated signaling pathways in gp120-induced cytokine expression, we have focused on CaMKII and JNKs, the well characterized down-stream targets of Wnt5a signaling. We find that Wnt5a is required for gp120 to activate CaMKII and JNK signaling. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the Wnt5a/CaMKII pathway is critical for the gp120-induced expression of IL-1β, whereas the Wnt5a/JNK pathway is for TNF-α expression. Meanwhile, the expression of IL-6 is co-regulated by both pathways. These results collectively suggest that Wnt5a signaling cascades play a crucial role in the regulation of gp120-induced expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines in the CNS."
https://openalex.org/W1979361881,"Multiple growth pathways lead to enhanced proliferation in malignant cells. However, how the core machinery of DNA replication is regulated by growth signaling remains largely unclear. The sliding clamp proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) is an indispensable component of the DNA machinery responsible for replicating the genome and maintaining genomic integrity. We previously reported that epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) triggered tyrosine 211 (Y211) phosphorylation of PCNA, which in turn stabilized PCNA on chromatin to promote cell proliferation. Here we show that the phosphorylation can also be catalyzed by the non-receptor tyrosine kinase c-Abl. We further demonstrate that, in the absence of EGFR, signaling to PCNA can be attained through the activation of the Ron receptor tyrosine kinase and the downstream non-receptor tyrosine kinase c-Abl. We show that Ron and c-Abl form a complex, and that activation of Ron by its ligand, hepatocyte growth factor-like protein (HGFL), stimulates c-Abl kinase activity, which in turn directly phosphorylates PCNA at Y211 and leads to an increased level of chromatin-associated PCNA. Correspondingly, HGFL-induced Ron activation resulted in Y211 phosphorylation of PCNA while silencing of c-Abl blocked this effect. We show that c-Abl and Y211 phosphorylation of PCNA is an important axis downstream of Ron, which is required for cell proliferation. Treatment with a specific peptide that inhibits Y211 phosphorylation of PCNA or with the c-Abl pharmacological inhibitor imatinib suppressed HGFL-induced cell proliferation. Our findings identify the pathway of Ron-c-Abl-PCNA as a mechanism of oncogene-induced cell proliferation, with potentially important implications for development of combination therapy of breast cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2013596938,"RUNX3 is silenced by histone modification and hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1α is stabilized under hypoxia, but little is known of cross-talk between RUNX3 and HIF-1α under hypoxia. In the present study, the authors investigated the effect of RUNX3 on HIF-1α stability in gastric cancer cells. RUNX3 overexpression was found to downregulate HIF-1α stability under normoxic and hypoxic conditions. Furthermore, the activity of a luciferase reporter containing five copies of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) promoter hypoxia-responsive element (5 × HRE) and the amount of secreted VEGF, were diminished in RUNX3-expressing but increased in RUNX3-knockdown cells. When expression of RUNX3 was recovered using epigenetic reagents the expressions of HIF-1α and VEGF were clearly suppressed under hypoxic conditions. RUNX3 also significantly attenuated the half-life of HIF-1α protein, and induced the cytosolic localization and ubiquitination of HIF-1α. In addition, RUNX3 directly interacted with the C-terminal activation domain of HIF-1α and prolyl hydroxylase (PHD) 2 and enhanced the interaction between HIF-1α and PHD2, which potentiated proline hydroxylation and promoted the degradation of HIF-1α. Furthermore, RUNX3 overexpression significantly inhibited hypoxia-induced angiogenesis in vitro and in vivo. Taken together, these results suggest that RUNX3 destabilizes HIF-1α protein by promoting the proline hydroxylation of HIF-1α through binding to HIF-1α/PHD2. RUNX3 appears to be a novel suppressor of HIF-1α and of hypoxia-mediated angiogenesis in gastric cancer cells."
https://openalex.org/W2072349845,"15-Hydroxyprostaglandin dehydrogenase (15-PGDH) is a key enzyme in prostaglandin (PG) metabolism. This study provides important evidence for inhibition of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) growth by 15-PGDH through the 15-keto-prostaglandin E2 (15-keto-PGE2)/peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ (PPARγ)/p21(WAF1/Cip1) signaling pathway. Forced overexpression of 15-PGDH inhibited HCC cell growth in vitro, whereas knockdown of 15-PGDH enhanced tumor growth parameters. In a tumor xenograft model in severe combined immunodeficiency mice, inoculation of human HCC cells (Huh7) with overexpression of 15-PGDH led to significant inhibition of tumor growth, whereas knockdown of 15-PGDH enhanced tumor growth. In a separate tumor xenograft model in which mouse HCC cells (Hepa1-6) were inoculated into syngeneic C57BL/6 mice, intratumoral injection of adenovirus vector expressing 15-PGDH (pAd-15-PGDH) significantly inhibited xenograft tumor growth. The antitumor effect of 15-PGDH is mediated through its enzymatic product, 15-keto-PGE2, which serves as an endogenous PPARγ ligand. Activation of PPARγ by 15-PGDH-derived 15-keto-PGE2 enhanced the association of PPARγ with the p21(WAF1/Cip1) promoter and increased p21 expression and association with cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (CDK2), CDK4 and proliferating cell nuclear antigen. Depletion of p21 by short hairpin RNA reversed 15-PGDH-induced inhibition of HCC cell growth; overexpression of p21 prevented 15-PGDH knockdown-induced tumor cell growth. These results show a key 15-PGDH/15-keto-PGE2-mediated activation of PPARγ and p21(WAF1/Cip1) signaling cascade that regulates hepatocarcinogenesis and tumor progression."

Aminoacyl-tRNA enters the translating ribosome in a ternary complex with elongation factor Tu (EF-Tu) and GTP. Here, we describe bulk steady state and pre-steady state fluorescence methods that enabled us to quantitatively explore the kinetic features of Escherichia coli ternary complex formation and decay. The data obtained suggest that both processes are controlled by a nucleotide-dependent, rate-determining conformational change in EF-Tu. Unexpectedly, we found that this conformational change is accelerated by elongation factor Ts (EF-Ts), the guanosine nucleotide exchange factor for EF-Tu. Notably, EF-Ts attenuates the affinity of EF-Tu for GTP and destabilizes ternary complex in the presence of non-hydrolyzable GTP analogs. These results suggest that EF-Ts serves an unanticipated role in the cell of actively regulating the abundance and stability of ternary complex in a manner that contributes to rapid and faithful protein synthesis."
https://openalex.org/W2044415660,"Within the family of protein kinase C (PKC) molecules, the novel isoform PRKCE (PKCɛ) acts as a bona fide oncogene in in vitro and in vivo models of tumorigenesis. Previous studies have reported expression of PKCɛ in breast, prostate and lung tumors above that of normal adjacent tissue. Data from the cancer genome atlas suggest increased copy number of PRKCE in triple negative breast cancer (TNBC). We find that overexpression of PKCɛ in a non-tumorigenic breast epithelial cell line is sufficient to overcome contact inhibition and results in the formation of cellular foci. Correspondingly, inhibition of PKCɛ in a TNBC cell model results in growth defects in two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) culture conditions and orthotopic xenografts. Using stable isotope labeling of amino acids in a cell culture phosphoproteomic approach, we find that CTNND1/p120ctn phosphorylation at serine 268 (P-S268) occurs in a strictly PKCɛ-dependent manner, and that loss of PKCɛ signaling in TNBC cells leads to reversal of mesenchymal morphology and signaling. In a model of Ras activation, inhibition of PKCɛ is sufficient to block mesenchymal cell morphology. Finally, treatment with a PKCɛ ATP mimetic inhibitor, PF-5263555, recapitulates genetic loss of function experiments impairing p120ctn phosphorylation as well as compromising TNBC cell growth in vitro and in vivo. We demonstrate PKCɛ as a tractable therapeutic target for TNBC, where p120ctn phosphorylation may serve as a readout for monitoring patient response."
https://openalex.org/W2091269753,"P63, a p53 family member, is expressed as TA and ΔN isoforms. Interestingly, both TAp63 and ΔNp63 are transcription factors, and regulate both common and distinct sets of target genes. p63 is required for survival of some epithelial cell lineages, and lack of p63 leads to loss of epidermis and other epithelia in humans and mice. Here, we explored the role of p63 isoforms in cell proliferation, migration and tubulogenesis by using Madin–Darby Canine Kidney (MDCK) tubular epithelial cells in two- or three-dimensional (2-D or 3-D) culture. We found that like downregulation of p53, downregulation of p63 and TAp63 decreases expression of growth-suppressing genes, including p21, PUMA and MIC-1, and consequently promotes cell proliferation and migration in 2-D culture. However, in 3-D culture, downregulation of p63, especially TAp63, but not p53, decapacitates MDCK cells to form a cyst structure through enhanced epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT). In contrast, downregulation of ΔNp63 inhibits MDCK cell proliferation and migration in 2-D culture, and delays but does not block MDCK cell cyst formation and tubulogenesis in 3-D culture. Consistent with this, downregulation of ΔNp63 markedly upregulates growth-suppressing genes, including p21, PUMA and MIC-1. Taken together, these data suggest that TAp63 is the major isoform required for tubulogenesis by maintaining an appropriate level of EMT, whereas ΔNp63 fine-tunes the rate of cyst formation and tubulogenesis by maintaining an appropriate expression level of genes involved in cell cycle arrest and apoptosis."

We report the first biochemical characterization of a Moco-free eukaryotic NR from the fungus Neurospora crassa, documenting that Moco is necessary and sufficient to induce dimer formation. The molybdenum center of NR reconstituted in vitro from apo-NR and Moco showed an EPR spectrum identical to holo-NR. Analysis of mutants unable to bind heme or FAD revealed that insertion of Moco into NR occurs independent from the insertion of any other NR redox cofactor.

On the other hand, when SAG is immobilized onto a surface such as hydroxyapatite, the interaction with P1 mediates adherence and subsequent colonization of the bacteria. S. mutans binding to fluid-phase or immobilized SAG are both P1-mediated events, and a P1-deficient mutant of S. mutans does not aggregate or adhere (15Crowley P.J. Brady L.J. Michalek S.M.

Like the V-region, the three C-terminal domains of P1 also display a great deal of β-structure, and the structure of the N-terminal 163 amino acids (∼20 kDa) preceding the A-region is currently unknown. Previous work in our laboratory has suggested that the N-terminal region of P1 is required for the proper assembly and function of the full-length adhesin on the surface of S. mutans (45Crowley P.J. Seifert T.B. Isoda R. van Tilburg M. Oli M.W. Robinette R.A. McArthur W.P. Bleiweis A.S. Brady L.J. Requirements for surface expression and function of adhesin P1 from Streptococcus mutans.Infect. Immun. 2008; 76: 2456-2468Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). In the current study our goal was to further elucidate the contribution of the N-terminal region to the function of P1 and to characterize the discontinuous interaction between the N- and C-terminal regions of the molecule. We demonstrate herein that disrupting the N-terminal/C-terminal interaction within P1 disproportionately abolishes the adherence compared with the aggregation properties of S. mutans in the presence of immobilized and fluid-phase SAG, respectively. We also demonstrate the formation of a functional complex formed by an N-terminal fragment (NA1) and a C-terminal fragment (P3C) (Fig. 1b) that reconstitutes a structure mimicking that of native P1 on the surface of S. mutans. Formation of this complex has high energetic favorability and displays increased adherence properties to immobilized SAG compared with that of P3C alone despite a lack of independent adherence to SAG by NA1. Last, an in-frame deletion polypeptide, lacking amino acids 86–190 of P1, displays decreased adherence to immobilized SAG, decreased thermal stability, and notable differences in secondary structure as compared with the full-length protein.

NA1 and P3C were expressed and purified as follows: 20-ml terrific broth cultures were grown overnight at 37 °C and used to inoculate 1 liter of terrific broth the following day. Cultures were grown to an A600 of 0.7–0.8 then induced with 1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside and incubated overnight at 22 °C. Cells were harvested the following morning, and the cell pellets were stored at −20 °C overnight. The following day the cell pellets were suspended in TALON equilibration buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, 300 mm NaCl, pH 7.4) supplemented with 20 μl of DNase I (Thermo Scientific, Rockford, IL), 10 mg of lysozyme, and 10 mm MgCl2 and sonicated on ice with a sonic dismembrator (Fisher, Model 100) at maximum setting for 2 min using 5-s bursts. Cells were incubated at 4 °C on a rotary actuator for 1 h, and the sonication was repeated. The cell sonicates were centrifuged at 45,000 × g for 30 min, and the supernatant (soluble) fractions were filtered through a 0.22-μm syringe-driven filter (Millipore, Billerica, MA). Filtered samples were then applied to TALON Metal Affinity Resin (Clontech, Mountain View, CA), and bound protein was eluted with 150 mm imidazole. Elution fractions were subsequently passed over amylose affinity matrix resin (New England Biolabs), and bound protein was eluted with 200 mm maltose. The purified protein was dialyzed overnight into 10 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, and 2 mm CaCl2, concentrated using an Amicon filter (Millipore), 10-kDa molecular weight cutoff, and digested with Factor Xa (New England Biolabs) to remove the MBP tag. Digested proteins were separated from Factor Xa and free MBP first using TALON resin and elution with 150 mm imidazole followed by passing over amylose resin to remove residual free MBP or MBP fusion protein. NA1 and P3C were polished over an SEC-250 size-exclusion column (Bio-Rad). The NA1-P3C complex was purified as above, except before polishing NA1 and P3C were mixed together in equimolar ratios, incubated overnight at 4 °C, and the following day, purified using the SEC-250 column. During the initial lysis process and purification of P3C over TALON resin, a stable breakdown product is produced. This product is no longer MBP-tagged but retains the C-terminal His6 tag. The breakdown product was separated from the P3C-MBP fusion protein using amylose affinity matrix resin and determined by N-terminal sequencing to represent the C terminus of P1 (aa 1000–1486). Additional P1 constructs, full-length recombinant P1 lacking the secretion signal sequence (rP1, aa 39–1566), and recombinant NR7 (Δaa 84–190) were subcloned into pQE-30 and used to transform E. coli strain M15-pREP4 as described previously (32McArthur W.P.

https://openalex.org/W2038584643,"Aberrant regulation of the pRB/E2F1 pathway has been invariably linked to inappropriate proliferation and/apoptosis in human cancers. Therefore, understanding the intricacies of the signaling pathway and identification of novel E2F1 targets involved in apoptosis could pave way for new therapeutic manipulation. Here, we identified CTSL2 (cathepsin L2/cathepsin V) as a novel E2F1 target that participates in E2F1-dependent apoptosis. We showed that E2F1 directly binds to CTSL2 promoter and that CTSL2 is regulated by both exogenous and endogenous E2F1. RNAi-mediated depletion of CTSL2 effectively abrogated ectopic E2F1-induced apoptosis, coupled with reduced lysosomal membrane permeabilization (LMP) and mitochondrial membrane depolarization. CTSL2 knockdown also inhibited apoptosis mediated by the endogenous E2F1 activated by DNA damage. Furthermore, we showed that CTSL2 depletion in cancer cells resulted in inhibition of histone deacetylase inhibitor (HDACi)-induced apoptosis, and conversely ectopic overexpression of CTSL2-sensitized cancer cells to HDACi. This study uncovered a novel E2F1 target implicated in LMP and apoptosis activation, as well as in the modulation of HDACi and chemotherapeutic drugs response."
