https://openalex.org/W2942678593,"Alzheimer's disease is a pervasive neurodegenerative disorder, the molecular complexity of which remains poorly understood. Here, we analysed 80,660 single-nucleus transcriptomes from the prefrontal cortex of 48 individuals with varying degrees of Alzheimer's disease pathology. Across six major brain cell types, we identified transcriptionally distinct subpopulations, including those associated with pathology and characterized by regulators of myelination, inflammation, and neuron survival. The strongest disease-associated changes appeared early in pathological progression and were highly cell-type specific, whereas genes upregulated at late stages were common across cell types and primarily involved in the global stress response. Notably, we found that female cells were overrepresented in disease-associated subpopulations, and that transcriptional responses were substantially different between sexes in several cell types, including oligodendrocytes. Overall, myelination-related processes were recurrently perturbed in multiple cell types, suggesting that myelination has a key role in Alzheimer's disease pathophysiology. Our single-cell transcriptomic resource provides a blueprint for interrogating the molecular and cellular basis of Alzheimer's disease."

https://openalex.org/W2943410524,"Given the high prevalence of common mental disorders (CMDs) and individuals living alone in the United Kingdom, the goal of this study using English nationally representative data was to examine the association between living alone and CMDs, and to identify potential mediating factors of this association. The data were drawn from the 1993, 2000 and 2007 National Psychiatric Morbidity Surveys. CMDs were assessed using the Clinical Interview Schedule-Revised (CIS-R), a questionnaire focusing on past week neurotic symptoms. The presence of CMDs was defined as a CIS-R total score of 12 and above. Multivariable logistic regression and mediation analyses were conducted to analyze the association between living alone and CMDs, and to identify mediators in this association. The prevalence of CMDs was higher in individuals living alone than in those not living alone in all survey years. Multivariable analysis showed a positive association between living alone and CMDs in all survey years (1993: odds ratio [OR] = 1.69; 2000: OR = 1.63; and 2007: OR = 1.88). Overall, loneliness explained 84% of the living alone-CMD association. Living alone was positively associated with CMDs. Interventions addressing loneliness among individuals living alone may be particularly important for the mental wellbeing of this vulnerable population."
https://openalex.org/W2943238580,"This study reports on physicians' experiences with chronic pain management. For over a decade prescription opioids have been a primary treatment for chronic pain in North America. However, the current opioid epidemic has complicated long-standing practices for chronic pain management which historically involved prescribing pain medication. Caring for patients with chronic pain occurs within a context in which a growing proportion of patients suffer from chronic rather than acute conditions alongside rising social inequities.Our team undertook an ethnographic approach known as institutional ethnography in the province of Ontario, Canada in order to explore the social organization of chronic pain management from the standpoint of primary care physicians. This paper reports on a subset of this study data, specifically interviews with 19 primary care clinicians and 8 nurses supplemented by 40 hours of observations. The clinicians in our sample were largely primary care physicians and nurses working in urban, rural and Northern settings.In their reflections on providing care for patients with chronic pain, many providers describe being most challenged by the work involved in helping patients who also struggled with poverty, mental health and addiction. These frustrations were often complicated by concerns that they could lose their license for inappropriate prescribing, thus shifting their work from providing treatment and care to policing their patients for malingering and opioid abuse.Our findings show that care providers find the treatment of patients with chronic pain-especially those patients also experiencing poverty-to be challenging at best, and at worst frustrating and overwhelming. In many instances, their narratives suggested experiences of depersonalization, loss of job satisfaction and emotional exhaustion in relation to providing care for these patients, key dimensions of burnout. In essence, the work that they performed in relation to their patients' social rather than medical needs seems to contribute to these experiences. Their experiences were further exacerbated by the fact that restricting and reducing opioid dosing in patients with chronic pain has become a major focus of care provision."
https://openalex.org/W2942812951,"Generalized linear latent variable models (GLLVM) are popular tools for modeling multivariate, correlated responses. Such data are often encountered, for instance, in ecological studies, where presence-absences, counts, or biomass of interacting species are collected from a set of sites. Until very recently, the main challenge in fitting GLLVMs has been the lack of computationally efficient estimation methods. For likelihood based estimation, several closed form approximations for the marginal likelihood of GLLVMs have been proposed, but their efficient implementations have been lacking in the literature. To fill this gap, we show in this paper how to obtain computationally convenient estimation algorithms based on a combination of either the Laplace approximation method or variational approximation method, and automatic optimization techniques implemented in R software. An extensive set of simulation studies is used to assess the performances of different methods, from which it is shown that the variational approximation method used in conjunction with automatic optimization offers a powerful tool for estimation."
https://openalex.org/W2943507226,"This cross-sectional study aimed at evaluating the knowledge and attitudes concerning influenza vaccination in Southern Italy, and investigating the potential determinants of vaccine uptake. The sample consisted of 700 adults (mean age 58.7y) with chronic diseases attending four public specialty clinics in Italy. Overall, 64.7% of the participants were aware that influenza can be prevented with vaccines and that patients with chronic diseases are at higher risk of developing severe complications. Less than half of the sample (42.1%) received influenza vaccine in the last season, and 46.9% declared the will to receive influenza vaccination in the next season. The level of awareness was significantly lower among the elderly (> = 65y) and those with a higher self-reported health. A significantly higher likelihood of vaccination was observed among the elderly, the subjects with a higher knowledge about vaccine utility and safety, the participants with chronic respiratory diseases, and those who had taken more drugs. Future education programs and communication strategies are strongly needed in adults with chronic diseases to improve influenza vaccination knowledge and uptake."
https://openalex.org/W2942665935,"Commercial diets high in animal protein and fat are increasingly being developed for pets, however little is understood about the impacts of feeding such diets to domestic cats. The carbohydrate content of these diets is typically low, and dietary fibre is often not included. Dietary fibre is believed to be important in the feline gastrointestinal tract, promoting stool formation and providing a substrate for the hindgut microbiome. Therefore, we aimed to determine the effects of adding plant-based dietary fibre to a high animal protein and fat diet. Twelve domestic short hair cats were fed three complete and balanced diets in a cross-over design for blocks of 21 days: raw meat (Raw), raw meat plus fibre (2%, ‘as is’ inclusion of inulin and cellulose; Raw+Fibre) and a commercially available Kibble diet. A commercially available canned diet was fed for 21 days as a washout phase. Apparent macronutrient digestibility, faecal output, score, pH, organic acid concentrations and bacteriome profiles were determined. Diet significantly affected all faecal parameters measured. The addition of dietary fibre to the raw meat diet was found to reduce apparent macronutrient digestibility, increase faecal output, pH and score. Thirty one bacterial taxa were significantly affected by diet. Prevotella was found to dominate in the Kibble diet, Clostridium and Fusobacterium in the Raw diet, and Prevotella and a group of unclassified Peptostreptococcaceae in the Raw+Fibre diet. Our results show that diets of different macronutrient proportions can strongly influence the faecal microbiome composition and metabolism, as shown by altered organic acid concentrations and faecal pH, in the domestic cat. The addition of 2% of each fibre to the Raw diet shifted faecal parameters closer to those produced by feeding a Kibble diet. These results provide a basis for further research assessing raw red meat diets to domestic cats."
https://openalex.org/W2942812804,"Concussion non-disclosure research has focused almost exclusively on athletes. The focus on athletic populations has been sensible considering athletes' demonstrated susceptibility to sustaining and concealing concussions. Nevertheless, the habitual use of athletic populations has allowed researchers and practitioners to omit the development of generalized perceived costs and perceived rewards as critical determinants of concussion self-disclosure. We hypothesized that perceiving concussion disclosure as generally more costly than rewarding would predict negative attitudes towards disclosure and decreased intent to disclose. We also hypothesized that generalized perceived costs and rewards could explain concussion non-disclosure in different populations, athletes and future pilots specifically, even when those populations perceive concussion self-disclosure as costly for different specific reasons.We examined concussion disclosure using 2,504 cadets at the United States Air Force Academy. Cadets completed anonymous surveys assessing their intention to self-disclose undiagnosed concussions (Anticipated Concussion Disclosure) as well as several variables potentially related to concussion self-disclosure: perceived cost, perceived reward, personal identity, attitudes, normative behavior, social support, and self-efficacy.The results demonstrate that concussion non-disclosure develops when a population perceives disclosure as more costly (i.e. directly or emotionally) and less rewarding. Perceived Cost and Perceived Reward variables alone accounted for 50% of the variance in Anticipated Conclusion Disclosure (Adjusted R2 = 0.50, F(2,2312) = 1,145.31, p < 0.001). As expected, Anticipated Conclusion Disclosure developed for different reasons within different sub-populations. Consistent with existing research, cadet intercollegiate athletes reported being primarily concerned that concussion self-disclosure would cause them to miss practice or game time (t (736.7) = 14.20, p < .001, Cohen's d = 0.96). In contrast, cadet future pilots reported being primarily concerned that concussion self-disclosure would have negative United States Air Force career repercussions (t (1828) = 10.25, p < .001, Cohen's d = 0.50).These results suggest that cultures of concussion non-disclosure can develop in any population where disclosure is perceived as having undesirable consequences, not just athletic populations. Concussion researchers and practitioners should devote more attention to the perceived cost-benefit structures that create concussion non-disclosure to address this crucial public health issue more effectively."
https://openalex.org/W2893775478,"Background The iDSI reference case, originally published in 2014, aims to improve the quality and comparability of cost-effectiveness analyses (CEA). This study assesses whether the development of the guideline is associated with an improvement in methodological and reporting practices for CEAs using disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs). Methods We analyzed the Tufts Medical Center Global Health CEA Registry to identify cost-per-DALY averted studies published from 2011 to 2017. Among each of 11 principles in the iDSI reference case, we translated all methodological specifications and reporting standards into a series of binary questions (satisfied or not satisfied) and awarded articles one point for each item satisfied. We then calculated methodological and reporting adherence scores separately as a percentage of total possible points, measured as normalized adherence score (0% = no adherence; 100% = full adherence). Using the year 2014 as the dissemination period, we conducted a pre-post analysis. We also conducted sensitivity analyses using: 1) optional criteria in scoring, 2) alternate dissemination period (2014–2015), and 3) alternative comparator classification. Results Articles averaged 60% adherence to methodological specifications and 74% adherence to reporting standards. While methodological adherence scores did not significantly improve (59% pre-2014 vs. 60% post-2014, p = 0.53), reporting adherence scores increased slightly over time (72% pre-2014 vs. 75% post-2014, p<0.01). Overall, reporting adherence scores exceeded methodological adherence scores (74% vs. 60%, p<0.001). Articles seldom addressed budget impact (9% reporting, 10% methodological) or equity (7% reporting, 7% methodological). Conclusions The iDSI reference case has substantial potential to serve as a useful resource for researchers and policy-makers in global health settings, but greater effort to promote adherence and awareness is needed to achieve its potential."
https://openalex.org/W2943244258,"Trastuzumab and pertuzumab are monoclonal antibodies that bind to distinct subdomains of the extracellular domain of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2). Adding these monoclonal antibodies to the treatment regimen of HER2-positive breast cancer has changed the paradigm for treatment in that form of cancer. Synergistic activity has been observed with the combination of these two antibodies leading to hypotheses regarding the mechanism(s) and to the development of bispecific antibodies to maximize the clinical effect further. Although the individual crystal structures of HER2-trastuzumab and HER2-pertuzumab revealed the distinct binding sites and provided the structural basis for their anti-tumor activities, detailed structural information on the HER2-trastuzumab-pertuzumab complex has been elusive. Here we present the cryo-EM structure of HER2-trastuzumab-pertuzumab at 4.36 Å resolution. Comparison with the binary complexes reveals no cooperative interaction between trastuzumab and pertuzumab, and provides key insights into the design of novel, high-avidity bispecific molecules with potentially greater clinical efficacy."
https://openalex.org/W2942841290,"High-throughput droplet microfluidic devices with fluorescence detection systems provide several advantages over conventional end-point cytometric techniques due to their ability to isolate single cells and investigate complex intracellular dynamics. While there have been significant advances in the field of experimental droplet microfluidics, the development of complementary software tools has lagged. Existing quantification tools have limitations including interdependent hardware platforms or challenges analyzing a wide range of high-throughput droplet microfluidic data using a single algorithm. To address these issues, an all-in-one Python algorithm called FluoroCellTrack was developed and its wide-range utility was tested on three different applications including quantification of cellular response to drugs, droplet tracking, and intracellular fluorescence. The algorithm imports all images collected using bright field and fluorescence microscopy and analyzes them to extract useful information. Two parallel steps are performed where droplets are detected using a mathematical Circular Hough Transform (CHT) while single cells (or other contours) are detected by a series of steps defining respective color boundaries involving edge detection, dilation, and erosion. These feature detection steps are strengthened by segmentation and radius/area thresholding for precise detection and removal of false positives. Individually detected droplet and contour center maps are overlaid to obtain encapsulation information for further analyses. FluoroCellTrack demonstrates an average of a ~92–99% similarity with manual analysis and exhibits a significant reduction in analysis time of 30 min to analyze an entire cohort compared to 20 h required for manual quantification."
https://openalex.org/W2943176424,"Prosociality is important for initiating cooperation. Interestingly, while wolves rely heavily on cooperation, dogs’ do so substantially less thus leading to the prediction that wolves are more prosocial than dogs. However, domestication hypotheses suggest dogs have been selected for higher cooperation, leading to the opposing prediction- increased prosocial tendencies in dogs. To tease apart these hypotheses we adapted a paradigm previously used with pet dogs to directly compare dogs and wolves. In a prosocial choice task, wolves acted prosocially to in-group partners; providing significantly more food to a pack-member compared to a control where the partner had no access to the food. Dogs did not. Additionally, wolves did not show a prosocial response to non-pack members, in line with previous research that social relationships are important for prosociality. In sum, when kept in the same conditions, wolves are more prosocial than their domestic counterpart, further supporting suggestions that reliance on cooperation is a driving force for prosocial attitudes."
https://openalex.org/W2942731550,"Recently, ambient occlusion, quantified through portion de ciel visible (PCV) was introduced as a method for quantifying dental morphological wear resistance and reconstructing diet in mammals. Despite being used to reconstruct diet and investigate the relationship between dental form and function, no rigorous analysis has investigated the correlation between PCV and diet. Using a sample of platyrrhine and prosimians M2s, we show average PCV was significantly different between most dietary groups. In prosimian, insectivores had the lowest PCV, followed by folivores, omnivores, frugivores, and finally hard-object feeders. In platyrrhines, omnivores had the lowest average PCV, followed by folivores, frugivores, and finally hard-object feeders. PCV was correlated to two topographic variables (Dirichlet normal energy, DNE, and relief index, RFI) but uncorrelated to three others (orientation patch count rotated, OPCR, tooth surface area, and tooth size). The OPCR values here differed greatly from previously published values using the same sample, showing how differences in data acquisition (i.e., using 2.5D vs. 3D surfaces) can lead to drastic differences in results. Compared to other popular topographic variables, PCV performed as well or better at predicting diet in these groups, and when combined with a metric for size, the percent of successful dietary classifications reached 90%. Further, using an ontogenetic series of hominin (Paranthropus robustus) M2s, we show that PCV correlates well with probability of wear, with PCV values being higher on the portions of the occlusal surface that experience more wear (e.g., cusps and crest tips, wear facets) than the portions of the tooth that experience less. This relationship is strongest once wear facets have begun to form on the occlusal surface. These results highlight the usefulness of PCV in quantifying morphological wear resistance and predicting diet in mammals."
https://openalex.org/W2943022153,"This study investigated articular cartilage (AC) homeostasis and different signaling pathways involved in the superior cartilage regeneration of Murphy Roths large (MRL/MpJ) mice previously reported. We collected uninjured and destabilized medial meniscus (DMM)-injured knees from 8-wk-old C57BL/6J and MRL/MpJ mice. We used micro-computed tomography (microCT), histology, and immunohistochemistry to evaluate AC homeostasis and repair. We used the ear punch model to investigate the role of angiogenesis and inflammation in the superior healing of MRL/MpJ mice. We found fewer β-catenin and more pSMAD5 positive cells in the uninjured AC of MRL/MpJ mice than that from C57BL/6J mice. MRL/MpJ mice exhibited better AC repair in DMM-induced OA, as indicated by microCT results, Alcian blue, and Safranin O staining. Mechanistically, fewer β-catenin, pSMAD2-, pSMAD3-, a disintegrin and metalloproteinase with thrombospondin motifs 4-, matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) 9-, and MMP13-positive cells and more proliferating cell nuclear antigen- and pSMAD5-positive cells were found in the DMM-injured AC in MRL/MpJ mice than in normal mice. The accelerated ear wound healing of MRL/MpJ mice correlated with enhanced angiogenesis and macrophage polarization toward the M2a phenotype through elevated IL-10 and IL-4 expressing cells. Collectively, our study revealed that down-regulation of pSMAD2/3, β-catenin, and MMPs and up-regulation of pSMAD5 and M2a macrophage polarization contribute to the enhanced cartilage repair observed in MRL/MpJ mice.-Deng, Z., Gao, X., Sun, X., Amra, S., Lu, A., Cui, Y., Eltzschig, H.

https://openalex.org/W2943220657,"Suburbanization is happening rapidly on a global scale, resulting in changes to the species assemblages present in previously undeveloped areas of land. Community-level changes after anthropogenic land-use change have been studied in a variety of organisms, but the effects on arthropods of medical and veterinary importance remain poorly characterized. Shifts in diversity, abundance, and community composition of such arthropods, like mosquitoes, can significantly impact vector-borne disease dynamics due to varying vectorial capacity between different species. In light of these potential implications for vector-borne diseases, we investigated changes in mosquito species assemblage after suburbanization by sampling mosquitoes in neighborhoods of different ages in Wake County, North Carolina, US. We found that independent of housing density and socioeconomic status, mosquito diversity measures decreased as suburban neighborhoods aged. In the oldest neighborhoods, the mosquito assemblage reached a distinct suburban climax community dominated by the invasive, peridomestic container-breeding Aedes albopictus, the Asian tiger mosquito. Aedes albopictus is a competent vector of many pathogens of human concern, and its dominance in suburban areas places it in close proximity with humans, allowing for heightened potential of host-vector interactions. While further research is necessary to explicitly characterize the effects of mosquito community simplification on vector-borne disease transmission in highly suburbanized areas, the current study demonstrates that suburbanization is disrupting mosquito communities so severely that they do not recover their diversity even 100 years after the initial disturbance. Our understanding of the community-level effects of anthropogenic land-use change on arthropod vectors will become increasingly important as we look to mitigate disease spread in a global landscape that is continually developed and altered by humans."
https://openalex.org/W2942813200,"The precise number of Okenia taxa inhabiting the Mediterranean Sea, as well as their general taxonomy, varies according to different specialists. So far, eight valid species have been reported from the area: Okenia aspersa (Alder & Hancock, 1845), Okenia cupella (Vogel & Schultz, 1970), Okenia elegans (Leuckart, 1828), Okenia hispanica Valdés & Ortea, 1995, Okenia impexa Er. Marcus, 1957, Okenia leachii (Alder & Hancock, 1854), Okenia mediterranea (Ihering, 1886), and Okenia zoobotryon (Smallwood, 1910). Of these, only three (O. elegans, O. hispanica, and O. mediterranea) have their type localities in the Mediterranean Sea, whereas the others were described from different biogeographic areas and later included in the Mediterranean biota. We carried out a review on Mediterranean Okenia species through an integrative approach, based on a wide literature search and a morphological and molecular analysis of available type material and samples collected recently. The present study confirmed the presence of O. aspersa, O. elegans, O. hispanica, and O. mediterranea in the Mediterranean Sea, although leaving remaining questions about some of those taxa. The distribution of O. cupella, O. impexa, and O. zoobotryon is limited to the western Atlantic, and of O. leachii to the eastern Atlantic. All specimens previously identified as O. cupella, O. impexa, and O. zoobotryon by different authors in the Mediterranean Sea were repeatedly misidentified. Thus, we describe Okenia problematica sp. nov. and Okenia longiductis sp. nov., from the ""Mediterranean"" Okenia cupella/impexa and O. zoobotryon. We also consider here Okenia pusilla Sordi, 1974 a nomen dubium and include a redescription of the holotype of O. cupella. A molecular phylogeny, including all the sequenced Okenia species, was performed in order to evaluate the evolutionary relationships of the newly described species with the other congeneric taxa."
https://openalex.org/W2943713949,"Pacific martens (Martes caurina) are often associated with mature forests with complex structure for denning, resting, and efficient hunting. Nonetheless, a small isolated population of the Humboldt subspecies of Pacific martens (Martes caurina humboldtensis) occupies a narrow strip of young, coastal forest (< 70 years old) but not inland mature forest in the central Oregon Coast Range. We examined factors contributing to this unexpected distribution of martens by 1) analyzing marten diets using DNA metabarcoding to assess 90 scats, 2) using camera traps to assess differences in the relative abundances of prey, competitors, and predators across a coastal to inland gradient of vegetation types, and 3) quantifying differences in extent of fruit-producing shrubs and vegetation structure within vegetation types. Diets of martens were diverse (12, 10, and 3 species of birds, mammals, and amphibians respectively), and most fall and winter scats contained fruit. Voles, mice, and varied thrushes (Ixoreus naevius) were dominant prey items. Voles, mice, and most birds, but not varied thrushes, were more commonly observed in the coastal shrub-dominated forest than in inland forest. The coastal shrub-dominated forest had the highest diversity of vertebrates and potential prey overall. Bobcats (Lynx rufus), a key potential predator, were more commonly detected in inland forest. Of potential competitors, western spotted skunks (Spilogale gracilis) were more commonly detected in inland forest, with gray foxes (Urocyon cinereoargenteus) and raccoons (Procyon lotor) detected almost exclusively in coastal forests. Vegetation in coastal forests appears to provide, at least seasonally, more prey and fruit, and more overhead shrub cover compared with inland forest. Remaining plausible hypotheses for the restricted distribution of marten to coastal forests include increased prey, fruit, and overhead cover, and reduced predation risk from bobcats."
https://openalex.org/W2951308734,"Large trees are keystone structures in many terrestrial ecosystems. They contribute disproportionately to reproduction, recruitment and succession, and influence the structure, dynamics and diversity of forests. Recently, researchers have become concerned about evidence showing rapid declines in large, old trees in a range of ecosystems across the globe. We used ≥10 cm diameter at breast height (DBH) stem inventory data from 20, 0.5 ha forest plots spanning the wet tropical rainforest of Queensland, Australia to examine the contribution of large-diameter trees to above ground biomass (AGB), richness, dominance, mortality and recruitment. We show consistencies with tropical rainforest globally in that large-diameter trees (≥70 cm DBH) contribute much of the biomass (33%) from few trees (2.4% of stems ≥10 cm DBH) with the density of the largest trees explaining much of the variation (62%) in AGB across plots. Measurement of AGB in the largest 5% of trees allows plot biomass to be predicted with ~85% precision. In contrast to rainforest in Africa and America, we show that a high proportion of tree species are capable of reaching a large-diameter in Australian wet tropical rainforest resulting in weak biomass hyperdominance (~10% of species account for 50% of the biomass) leading to high potential resilience to regional disturbances and global environmental change. We show that the high AGB in Australian tropical forests is driven primarily by the high density of large trees coupled with contributions from high densities of medium size trees. Australian wet tropical rainforests are well positioned to maintain the current densities of large-diameter trees and high AGB into the future due to the species richness of large trees and a high density of replacement smaller trees."

https://openalex.org/W2943119716,"Objectives To explore the association between sex-specific adiposity trajectories among Adolescents to early adulthood with incident high blood pressure (HBP) and high plasma glucose (HPG). Methods We studied body mass index (BMI) trajectories among1159 (male = 517) and 664 (male = 263) Iranian adolescents, aged 12–20 years, for incident HPG and HBP, respectively. Latent Class Growth Mixture Modeling (LCGMM) on longitudinal data was used to determine sex-specific and distinct BMI trajectories. Logistic regressions were applied to estimate the relationship between latent class membership with HBP and HPG, considering normal trajectory as the reference. Results For both HBP and HPG, LCGMM determined two and three distinct BMI trajectories in males and females, respectively. During a follow-up of 12Years 104 (male = 62) and 111(male = 59) cases of HPG and HBP were found, respectively. Among females, faster BMI increases (i.e. overweight to early obese trajectory) but not overweight (i.e. those with BMI = 27.3 kg/m2 at baseline) trajectories increased the risk of HPG by adjusted odds ratios (ORs), 2.74 (1.10–5.80) and 0.79 (0.22–2.82), respectively; regarding HBP, the corresponding value for overweight to late obese trajectory was 3.72 (1.37–11.02). Among males, for HBP, the overweight trajectory increased the risk [2.09 (1.04–4.03)]; however, for incident HPG, none of the trajectories showed significant risk. Conclusions Among females, trend of increasing BMI parallel with age can be a better predictor for risk of developing HPG and HBP than those with higher BMI at baseline."
https://openalex.org/W2943632795,"Alopecia is a clinical condition caused by excessive hair loss which may result in baldness, the causes of which still remain elusive. Conditioned media (CM) from stem cells shows promise in regenerative medicine. Our aim was to evaluate the potential CM of dental pulp stem cells obtained from human deciduous teeth (SHED-CM) to stimulate hair growth under in vitro and in vivo conditions. SHED and hair follicle stem cells (HFSCs) (n = 3) were cultured in media combinations; i) STK2, ii) DMEM-KO+10% FBS, iii) STK2+2% FBS and profiled for the presence of positive hair growth-regulatory paracrine factors; SDF-1, HGF, VEGF-A, PDGF-BB and negative hair growth-regulatory paracrine factors; IL-1α, IL-1β, TGF-β, bFGF, TNF-α, and BDNF. The potential of CM from both cell sources to stimulate hair growth was evaluated based on the paracrine profile and measured dynamics of hair growth under in vitro conditions. The administration of CM media to telogen-staged synchronized 7-week old C3H/HeN female mice was carried out to study the potential of the CM to stimulate hair growth in vivo. SHED and HFSCs cultured in STK2 based media showed a shorter population doubling time, higher viability and better maintenance of MSC characteristics in comparison to cells cultured in DMEM-KO media. STK2 based CM contained only two negative hair growth-regulatory factors; TNF-α, IL-1 while DMEM-KO CM contained all negative hair growth-regulatory factors. The in vitro study confirmed that treatment with STK2 based media CM from passage 3 SHED and HFSCs resulted in a significantly higher number of anagen-staged hair follicles (p<0.05) and a significantly lower number of telogen-staged hair follicles (p<0.05). Administration of SHED-CM to C3H/HeN mice resulted in a significantly faster stimulation of hair growth in comparison to HFSC-CM (p<0.05), while the duration taken for complete hair coverage was similar for both CM sources. Thus, SHED-CM carries the potential to stimulate hair growth which can be used as a treatment tool for alopecia."
https://openalex.org/W2942778447,"Most people lack the opportunity to see non-domesticated animals in the wild. Consequently, people's perception of wild animals is based on what they see on (social) media. The way in which (social) media portrays non-domesticated animals determines our perception of and behaviour to these animals. People like to interact with animals, which is why venues which offer the opportunity to interact with non-domesticated animals are popular wildlife tourist attractions (WTAs). However, these WTAs more often than not profit at the expense of animal welfare, conservation and human safety. Participation in such WTAs should therefore be discouraged. Through (social) media we are regularly exposed to images of non-domesticated animals in close interactions with humans. Exposure to such images seems to blur the line between what is a friendly domesticated animal and what is a potentially dangerous wild animal. Such images may also increase our desire to engage in interactions with non-domesticated animals ourselves and reduce moral concerns about the use of non-domesticated animals for such interactions, thereby promoting WTAs in which tourists can interact with non-domesticated animals. Wild cat species are commonly used in the wildlife tourism industry to interact with tourists. In this study, we determine whether portrayal of wild cat species in interactions with humans promotes WTAs with wild cats. We presented respondents with an image of a wild cat species (lion, cheetah, caracal) in a control setting, walked by a human (WTA), petted by a human (WTA) or in the wild and asked them to answer a fixed set of questions. We found that portraying wild cat species in interactions with humans reduced the fear of wild cats, encouraged people to regard WTAs with wild cats as acceptable and stimulated them to participate in such activities themselves."

There is a close association between the anatomical characteristics and physiological and ecological functions of plants, but we still have a very limited knowledge of anatomical traits. For example, (1) we do not know if herbs and grasses have anatomical patterns similar to those of woody plants, and (2) the variation among different woody plants in the same ecosystem is unclear. In the present study, we analysed the anatomical structures of the fine root systems of various groups of vascular plants (ferns, eudicot herbs, monocots and woody plants) from the same ecosystem (a natural secondary forest on Mao'er Mountain, Heilongjiang, China) to answer the following questions: (1) How does the anatomy of the fine roots change with root order in various plant groups in the same ecosystem? (2) What is the pattern of variation within group? The results show that anatomical traits can be divided into 3 categories: traits that indicate the root capacity to transport resource along the root (stele diameter, xylem cell diameter and xylem cell area); traits that indicate absorptive capacity cortical thickness, (the number of cortical cell layers and the diameter of cortical cells); and traits that are integrated indicators (diameter and the stele to root diameter ratio). The traits indicate the root capacity to transport resource along the root order is generally similar among groups, but absorptive capacity is very different. The shift in function is the main factor influencing the fine root anatomy. Some traits show large variation within groups, but the variations in other traits are small. The traits indicate that the lower-order roots (absorbing roots) in distinct groups are of the first one or two root order in ferns, the first two or three orders in eudicot herbs, the first (only two root orders) or first two orders (more than three root orders) in monocots and the first four or five root orders in woody plants and the other roots are higher-order roots (transport roots). The result will helpful to understand the similarities and differences among groups and the physiological and ecological functions of plant roots."
https://openalex.org/W2943447585,"Antibodies that block the adherence of enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) to host intestinal epithelial cells are protective. Multiepitope-fusion-antigens (MEFAs) carrying epitopes of ETEC adhesin major subunits or tip minor subunits induced antibodies against ETEC adherence. Adherence inhibition effectiveness of antibodies induced by major subunit epitopes versus minor tip subunit epitopes, however, has not been comparatively characterized. In this study, we immunized mice with a major subunit MEFA or a tip MEFA, evaluated MEFA anti-adhesin immunogenicity, and examined induced-antibodies against bacteria in vitro adherence or in vivo colonization in mice. Mice subcutaneously immunized with major subunit MEFA CFA/I/II/IV or tip MEFA showed no adverse effects and developed strong antigen-specific antibody responses. Data showed that antibodies derived from two MEFAs were equally effective against adherence of the bacteria expressing CS1, CS2, CS3, CS4/CS6, CS5/CS6, or CS6 adhesin in vitro. Subsequently, we immunized mice with CFA/I fimbriae, major subunit CfaB, or minor tip adhesin subunit CfaE. We found that antibodies induced by CFA/I, CfaB and CfaE equally inhibited in vitro adherence of ETEC strain H10407. Furthermore, we immunized mice with CFA/I fimbriae, CfaB, or CfaE, and then challenged the mice with H10407. Data showed that although not significantly, fewer H10407 bacteria colonized the immunized mice. These results suggest that ETEC adhesin major subunit and minor tip subunit should be equally effective in inducing neutralizing anti-adhesin antibodies, and that major subunit CFA/I/II/IV MEFA or tip MEFA, perhaps combined with toxoid fusion 3xSTaN12S-mnLTR192G/L211A, can be used for development of broadly protective vaccines against ETEC diarrhea."
https://openalex.org/W2943589147,"The sulfonylurea 1 transient receptor potential melastatin 4 (Sur1-Trpm4) receptor is selectively expressed after intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH). This upregulation contributes to increases in intracellular sodium. Water follows sodium through aquaporin channels, leading to cytotoxic edema. Even after edema is thought to have resolved, ionic dyshomeostasis persists, as does blood-brain barrier (BBB) damage. Glibenclamide, a hypoglycemic agent that inhibits Sur1-Trpm4, has been shown to reduce BBB damage and edema following infusion of autologous blood into the brain (ICH) as well as after other brain injuries. In order to further assess efficacy, we used the collagenase ICH model in rats to test whether glibenclamide reduces edema, attenuates ion dyshomeostasis, improves BBB damage, and reduces lesion volume. We tested a widely-used glibenclamide dose shown effective in other studies (10 μg/kg loading dose followed by 200 ng/hr for up to 7 days). Early initiation of glibenclamide did not significantly impact edema (72 hours), BBB permeability (72 hours), or lesion volume after ICH (28 days). Recovery from neurological impairments was also not improved by glibenclamide. These results suggest that glibenclamide will not improve outcome in ICH. However, the treatment appeared to be safe as there was no effect on bleeding or other physiological variables."
https://openalex.org/W2942887368,"One of the primary concerns in investment planning is to determine the number of shares for asset with relatively high net value of share such as Berkshire Hathaway on Stock market. Traditional asset allocation methods like Markowitz theorem gives the solution as a percentage and this ratio may suggest allocation of half of a share on the market, which is impractical. Thus, it is necessary to propose a method to determine the number of shares for each asset. This paper presents a knapsack based portfolio selection model where the expected returns, prices, and budget are characterized by interval values. The study determines the priority and importance of each share in the proposed model by extracting the interval weights from an interval comparison matrix. The resulted model is converted into a parametric linear programming model in which the decision maker is able to determine the optimism threshold. Finally, a discrete firefly algorithm is designed to find the near optional solutions in large dimensions. The proposed study is implemented for some data from the US stock exchange."

Although recent studies support the correlation between EZH2 expression and EMT, no reports have investigated their association using immunohistochemistry or explored their prognostic impact on lung adenocarcinoma. The aim of this study was to elucidate the association between EZH2 and EMT, and their prognostic significance.EZH2 and the EMT markers E-cadherin and Vimentin were examined by IHC in lung adenocarcinoma specimens that were resected from 2003-2012. Associations between EZH2 and EMT markers and their correlations with survival were analyzed.We enrolled 350 patients, approximately 70% of whom were diagnosed as pathological stage I. The rates of positive E-cadherin, Vimentin, and EZH2 expression were 60.3%, 21.4%, and 52.0%, respectively. There was a significant positive correlation between EZH2 and Vimentin expression (p = 0.008), and EZH2 scores were higher in the Mesenchymal group (p = 0.030). In multivariate analysis, EZH2 was an independent predictor of Vimentin expression, and vice versa. EMT and EZH2 overexpression were significantly correlated with poor disease-free and overall survival. Furthermore, the Epithelial group with high EZH2 expression had significantly worse disease-free and overall survival. Positive staining for EMT markers was unfavorable regarding disease-free survival among patients with low EZH2 expression.EMT and high EZH2 expression were associated with poor NSCLC prognoses. Vimentin is a key factor linking EMT and EZH2 in lung adenocarcinoma."

https://openalex.org/W2942907696,"Na+/H+ exchanger regulatory factor 1 (NHERF1; also known as ezrin-radixin-moesin-binding phosphoprotein 50) is a PSD-95, disc large, zona occludens-1 adapter that acts as a scaffold for signaling complexes and cytoskeletal-plasma membrane interactions. NHERF1 is crucial to β-2-adrenoceptor (β2AR)-mediated activation of cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) in epithelial cells, and NHERF1 has been proposed to mediate the recycling of internalized β2AR back to the cell membrane. In the current study, we assessed the role of NHERF1 in regulating cAMP-mediated signaling and immunomodulatory functions in airway smooth muscle (ASM). NHERF1 knockdown attenuated the induction of (protein kinase A) phospho-vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein (p-VASP) by isoproterenol (ISO), prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), or forskolin (FSK) as well as the induction of p-heat shock protein 20 after 4 h of stimulation with ISO and FSK. NHERF1 knockdown fully abrogated the ISO-, PGE2-, and FSK-induced IL-6 gene expression and cytokine production without affecting cAMP-mediated phosphodiesterase 4D (PDE4D) gene expression, phospho-cAMP response element-binding protein (p-CREB), and cAMP response element (CRE)-Luc, or PDGF-induced cyclin D1 expression. Interestingly, NHERF1 knockdown prevented ISO-induced chromatin-binding of the transcription factor CCAAT-enhancer-binding protein-β (c/EBPβ). c/EBPβ knockdown almost completely abrogated the cAMP-mediated IL-6 but not PDE4D gene expression. The differential regulation of cAMP-induced signaling and gene expression in our study indicates a role for NHERF1 in the compartmentalization of cAMP signaling in ASM.-Pera, T., Tompkins, E., Katz, M., Wang, B., Deshpande, D.

https://openalex.org/W2943066541,"Can participation in job-related training contribute to the formation and maintenance of adults' literacy skills? Although evidence suggests that participation in training is related to higher literacy skills, it remains unclear whether this association reflects a causal effect of training participation on literacy (training effects), results from the self-selection of more high-skilled individuals into training (selection effects), or is due to other sources of endogeneity (e.g., omitted variable bias). To unravel these possibilities, we used data from the Programme for the International Assessment of Adult Competencies (PIAAC) and its German follow-up, PIAAC-Longitudinal (PIAAC-L). As these unique data offer repeated measures of literacy skills, spaced three years apart, in a large and representative sample, they allowed us to disentangle training effects from selection effects and to account for potential endogeneity. Analyses revealed that, even after taking account of formal education and a host of job characteristics, individuals with higher literacy skills were more likely to participate in training. By contrast, no evidence for effects of training on literacy skills emerged in any of our models, which comprised lagged-dependent, fixed effects, and instrumental-variable models. These findings suggest that, rather than job-related training contributing to literacy development, individuals with higher literacy skills are more likely to participate in training."
https://openalex.org/W2943660456,"Screams are acoustically distinct, high-pitched and high-amplitude calls, produced by many social species. Despite a wide range of production contexts, screams are characterised by an acoustic structure that appears to serve in altering the behaviour of targeted receivers during agonistic encounters. In chimpanzees, this can be achieved by callers producing acoustic variants that correlate with their identity, social role, relationship with the targeted recipient, the composition of the audience and the nature of the event. Although vervet monkeys (Chlorocebus pygerythrus) have been studied for decades, not much is known about their agonistic screams. Here, we examined agonistic screams produced by wild vervet monkeys to investigate the degree to which caller identity, social role and conflict severity affected call structure. We found that screams were both individually distinctive and dependent of the agonistic events. In particular, victim screams were longer and higher-pitched than aggressor screams, while screams produced in severe conflicts (chases, physical contact) had higher entropy than those in mild conflicts. We discuss these findings in terms of their evolutionary significance and suggest that acoustic variation might serve to reduce the aggression level of opponents, while simultaneously attracting potential helpers."
https://openalex.org/W2942760553,"This paper examines whether a chilling effect of restrictive state laws aimed at immigrants creates a barrier to enrollment in the food stamp program (now called the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program or SNAP) for U.S. citizen children in low-income immigrant families. This analysis looks at 20 states in the continental United States from 2000 to 2008 that were either at or above the U.S. average for percentage of foreign-born population, or states that ranked in the top 10 percent in terms of change in foreign-born population for that time period. To examine this issue, a multivariate, regression-based difference-in-differences (DD) analysis was applied. The “treatment” group is immigrant families with a U.S. citizen child that is 130% of the federal poverty level or below in states with restrictive immigrant related legislation and the “control” group is native families meeting the same federal poverty level guidelines as well as low-income immigrant families in states without the restrictive legislation. The research findings show that there does not appear to be a chilling effect associated with restrictive state laws on participation in the food stamp program. Food insecurity is an immediate need that may override the impediments to enrollment due to immigration status, causing families to apply despite a negative climate toward immigrants. For policy makers and immigrant advocates it is important to know where chilling effects might not occur in order to work with politicians and federal agencies on crafting sound evidence-based policy. Independent of any chilling effect, the model shows that immigrant families are less likely to enroll in food stamp benefits, consistent with other literature. In addition, independent of the effects of restrictive immigration legislation, both non-citizen and naturalized mothers were less likely to be in a family with food stamp benefits compared to similar native-born mothers. This indicates that all states have a gap in food stamp program enrollment that merits further attention and research."
https://openalex.org/W2943760977,"Here, we present the genome of the industrial ethanol production strain Brettanomyces bruxellensis CBS 11270. The nuclear genome was found to be diploid, containing four chromosomes with sizes of ranging from 2.2 to 4.0 Mbp. A 75 Kbp mitochondrial genome was also identified. Comparing the homologous chromosomes, we detected that 0.32% of nucleotides were polymorphic, i.e. formed single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), 40.6% of them were found in coding regions (i.e. 0.13% of all nucleotides formed SNPs and were in coding regions). In addition, 8,538 indels were found. The total number of protein coding genes was 4897, of them, 4,284 were annotated on chromosomes; and the mitochondrial genome contained 18 protein coding genes. Additionally, 595 genes, which were annotated, were on contigs not associated with chromosomes. A number of genes was duplicated, most of them as tandem repeats, including a six-gene cluster located on chromosome 3. There were also examples of interchromosomal gene duplications, including a duplication of a six-gene cluster, which was found on both chromosomes 1 and 4. Gene copy number analysis suggested loss of heterozygosity for 372 genes. This may reflect adaptation to relatively harsh but constant conditions of continuous fermentation. Analysis of gene topology showed that most of these losses occurred in clusters of more than one gene, the largest cluster comprising 33 genes. Comparative analysis against the wine isolate CBS 2499 revealed 88,534 SNPs and 8,133 indels. Moreover, when the scaffolds of the CBS 2499 genome assembly were aligned against the chromosomes of CBS 11270, many of them aligned completely, some have chunks aligned to different chromosomes, and some were in fact rearranged. Our findings indicate a highly dynamic genome within the species B. bruxellensis and a tendency towards reduction of gene number in long-term continuous cultivation."

https://openalex.org/W2943451461,"Although mother-to-child transmission of HIV has dramatically declined, the number of in utero HIV-exposed, uninfected infants is on the increase. HIV-exposed infants are at an increased risk of mortality, morbidity and slower early growth than their non-HIV exposed counterparts. Maternal HIV increases the risk of having preterm deliveries, intrauterine growth restriction and low birth weight babies. However, the mechanism underlying dysregulation of fetal growth in HIV-infected pregnant women is unknown. We sought to determine whether maternal HIV is associated with dysregulation of the insulin-like growth factor (IGF) axis, some angiogenic factors or other related biomarkers that regulate fetal growth. A total of 102 normotensive pregnant women were enrolled in a small cross-sectional study. Amongst these were thirty-one HIV-1 positive women receiving combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) (Mean age: 30.0 ± 5.1 years; % on ART: 83.9%; median plasma viral load: 683 copies/ml; median CD4 count: 350 cells/ul) and 71 HIV uninfected women (mean age: 27.3 ± 5.8) recruited at delivery. A panel of biomarkers including IGF1 and IGF binding proteins (IGFBP1, IGFBP3), angiopoietins (ANG) 1 and 2, matrix metalloproteinases (MMP) 2 and 9, and galectin 13, was measured in plasma collected from the placental intervillous space. The levels of IGF1, IGFBP1, ANG1, ANG2, MMP2, MMP9 and Gal-13 were not affected by maternal HIV, even when adjusted for maternal factors in linear regression models (all p>0.05). It was observed that HIV-infection in pregnancy did not significantly affect key markers of the IGF axis and angiogenic factors. If anything, it did not affect women. These findings highlight the importance of the use of ART during pregnancy, which maintains factors necessary for fetal development closer to those of healthy women. However, decrease in IGF1 levels might be exacerbated in women con-infected with HIV and malaria."

No modification was implemented in ICU B in periods 2-4.After the intervention, a decrease in the overall number of tests per ICU-patient-days (37.3±5.5 (baseline) to 15.2±3.2 (- 59%); p<0.0001) was observed. The total cost of the tests decreased from 239±41 to 104±28 euros per ICU-patient days; p<0.0001. The effect on laboratory test orders was sustainable in period 3 (-49%) and 4 (-30%). No significant secondary effect of the intervention was observed in period 2. In ICU B, there was no significant change in the overall laboratory test orders in between the periods.Laboratory test containment is effective, likely safe and sustainable provided that an educational program is repeatedly promoted, that it makes sense for the whole team, that senior and junior physicians are both committed in the program, and that encouragements for laboratory orders containment at each everyday round discussions."
https://openalex.org/W2942917840,"It remains unclear how the visual system is able to extract affective content from complex scenes even with extremely brief (< 100 millisecond) exposures. One possibility, suggested by findings in machine vision, is that low-level features such as unlocalized, two-dimensional (2-D) Fourier spectra can be diagnostic of scene content. To determine whether Fourier image amplitude carries any information about the affective quality of scenes, we first validated the existence of image category differences through a support vector machine (SVM) model that was able to discriminate our intact aversive and neutral images with ~ 70% accuracy using amplitude-only features as inputs. This model allowed us to confirm that scenes belonging to different affective categories could be mathematically distinguished on the basis of amplitude spectra alone. The next question is whether these same features are also exploited by the human visual system. Subsequently, we tested observers’ rapid classification of affective and neutral naturalistic scenes, presented briefly (~33.3 ms) and backward masked with synthetic textures. We tested categorization accuracy across three distinct experimental conditions, using: (i) original images, (ii) images having their amplitude spectra swapped within a single affective image category (e.g., an aversive image whose amplitude spectrum has been swapped with another aversive image) or (iii) images having their amplitude spectra swapped between affective categories (e.g., an aversive image containing the amplitude spectrum of a neutral image). Despite its discriminative potential, the human visual system does not seem to use Fourier amplitude differences as the chief strategy for affectively categorizing scenes at a glance. The contribution of image amplitude to affective categorization is largely dependent on interactions with the phase spectrum, although it is impossible to completely rule out a residual role for unlocalized 2-D amplitude measures."

We designed a study to determine what physical factors restrict tunnel diameter and predict the maximum attainable tunnel diameter and depth. We collected field data on the size and spatial distributions of ghost crab (Ocypode spp.) burrows on two sandy beaches (Kawage Beach in Tsu, Mie Prefecture, Japan and Sakieda Beach in Ishigaki, Okinawa Prefecture, Japan), where O. ceratophthalma dominants the ghost crab fauna. We measured burrow depths and distance from shoreline in concert with water content of sandy beaches. To explain our observed distributions of crab burrows in the field, we performed experiments in a lab microcosm, comprising a horizontal tunnel through wet sand. We measured the static stability of tunnel structures in relation to water content and two strengths computed from loading force exerted on the sand overlying the tunnels. By comparing field and experimental data, we found that crabs construct their burrows in appropriately wet zones (wet enough to provide sufficient cohesion of the sand grains in tunnel walls to prevent collapse) and that tunnel diameters and depths are sufficiently small to prevent deformation and collapse of their tunnels."
https://openalex.org/W2943717581,"A number of molluscs within the Class Bivalvia are defined by their ability to secrete fine silk like threads known as byssus which are used to anchor themselves to solid substrates. With relatively few exceptions the majority of these species remain in a sedentary state throughout their life attached via their byssal threads. However, observations of adult Pinctada imbricata radiata pearl oysters made during this study revealed this species’ ability to implement active movement. Byssal threads were secreted in a sequence of attachment and detachment phases, which resulted in the active displacement of the oyster. The oyster was observed, in the laboratory over a 9 day period, travelling a distance of 28cm in a horizontal path. After horizontal displacement, a vertical climbing phase was observed until the oyster reached the water surface at which point the byssus was discarded and the animal dropped, drifting in accordance with water current intensity. It is possible that these adaptations of byssal use are a result of environmentally induced evolutionary change within P. i. radiata."

Patients are increasingly requesting a more uniform skin texture, especially for hands. Treatment options include dermoabrasion, intense pulsed light, cryotherapy, peelings, and laser therapy. Topical compounds can be employed, in alternative or associated with dermatologic procedures. The current study was designed to evaluate solar lentigo hyperpigmentation, skin architecture and clinician and patient assessments comparing a dermocosmetic lightening product (active) with a moisturizing product (control) according to clinical, digital and subjective analyses in 72 lesions over 12-month follow up period. Statistically significant differences were observed between the lesions treated with the active compared to the control in terms of papillary brightness (p = 0.03) and contrast (p = 0.03), and in the limitation of dermal-epidermal junction destructuring (p = 0.03) according to dermal-epidermal junction destructuring score at Reflectance Confocal Microscopy. Luminance (p = 0.04) and redness (p = 0.03) were improved at color analysis, and physician and patient evaluations favored the active in efficacy and patient satisfaction investigations. The dermocosmetic lightening product utilized in the current study proved to be more effective, according to clinical, digital and subjective analyses in reducing lesion hyperpigmentation, stabilizing the lesion skin architecture and increasing patient satisfaction compared to the control in a cohort of 36 subjects, over a 12-month period.

At each session, a scientist (who is expert in his own domain but a novice in design) consulted a designer (who is expert in design but a novice in science) in order to receive advice and guidance on how to improve a scientific visualization. At the Design Help Desk, this pairing consistently produced a momentary disequilibrium in the scientist's thought process: a disequilibrium that led to agency (where the scientist gained ownership of his/her own learning) and conceptual change in the scientist's understanding of visual design. Scientists who visited the Design Help Desk were satisfied with their experience, and their published work demonstrated an improved ability to visually communicate research findings-a skill critical to the advancement of science.

https://openalex.org/W2943072697,"Background Novel crystalloid solutions containing polyethylene glycol polymers (PEG-20k) produce dramatic resuscitation effects but dose-dependently produce a hypocoagulative state. The objective of this study was to examine possible mechanisms of this effect. Based on previous thromboelastography data, we hypothesize the effect is largely due to platelet interactions with the polymers. Methods Whole citrated blood from healthy volunteers was diluted ex-vivo 10% with crystalloids and tested for coagulation and platelet function. The specific tests included prothrombin time (PT), activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), fibrinogen and von Willebrand factor (vWf) activity, thrombin generation, thromboelastography with and without platelet mapping, platelet flow cytometry, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate. Findings Fibrinogen and vWF activities, PT, and aPTT were not affected by PEG-20k dilutions. Thrombin activity was mildly suppressed with PEG-20k (TTP- 20%). Platelet mapping demonstrated significantly greater % inhibition of both ADP and arachidonic acid-induced platelet aggregation with PEG-20k, but direct ADP-activated gpIIa/IIIb (PAC1) and P-selectin (CD62P) binding site expression was not altered. Mild dose-dependent suppression of TEG-MA was seen with PEG-20k using platelet poor plasma. Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rates (ESR) were dramatically accelerated after dilution with 10% PEG-20k, which was competitively blocked by smaller PEG polymers, suggesting nonspecific PEG-20k cell binding effects. Conclusions PEG-20k creates a mild hypocoagulative state in whole blood at concentrations ≥10%, which may be due to platelet-PEG interactions at the IIb/IIIa interface with lesser effects on fibrin polymerization. This interaction may cause a functional thrombasthenia induced by nonspecific platelet surface passivation by the PEG polymer."
https://openalex.org/W2943110364,"Wildlife restoration is one of the key components of conservation strategies, and this includes the rehabilitation and release of animals confiscated from wildlife traffickers. When primates are re-introduced, most individuals need a pre-release training to acquire the skills needed to survive in the wild. Pre-release training may either negatively or positively affect primate post-release behavior and survival. Post-release behavior, however, has rarely been monitored even though it is the only means to assess the survival of released individuals. Here, we present a thorough analysis of data from a 3-year radio tracking study on 32 orangutans (Pongo abelii) released in Sumatra after their rehabilitation. We investigated whether and how the age at release, the duration of the pre-release rehabilitation and training, and the release location affected the post-release individual spatial behavior. Orangutans released at older age exhibited post-release habitat selection patterns that were more comparable to that shown by wild conspecifics, i.e., they chose areas closer to rivers and at lower elevations (150-250 meters a.s.l.) where previous research had documented greater food availability. In contrast, individuals released at younger age showed a stronger spatial dependency on the rehabilitation station and exhibited disrupted habitat selection patterns; although after several months after the release all individuals tended to decrease their spatial reliance on the rehabilitation facility. This study indicates that the rehabilitation of individuals for a longer period and their release further from the rehabilitation station have facilitated the subsequent development of more natural spatial behavior, i.e. driven by food availability rather than by the dependence on care-giving human facility. Our study provides indications on how to improve the rehabilitation and release of confiscated orangutans, highlighting the importance of the age at release, the length of the rehabilitation program, and the location of the release site."

https://openalex.org/W2962998706,"Immunotherapy has recently shown important clinical successes in a substantial number of oncology indications. Additionally, the tumor somatic mutation load has been shown to associate with response to these therapeutic agents, and specific mutational signatures are hypothesized to improve this association, including signatures related to pathogen insults. We sought to study in silico the validity of these observations and how they relate to each other. We first addressed whether somatic mutations typically involved in cancer may increase, in a statistically meaningful manner, the similarity between common pathogens and the human exome. Our study shows that common mutagenic processes increase, in the upper range of biologically plausible frequencies, the similarity between cancer exomes and pathogen DNA at a scale of 12-16 nucleotide sequences and established that this increased similarity is due to the specific mutation distribution of the considered mutagenic processes. Next, we studied the impact of mutation rate and showed that increasing mutation rate generally results in an increased similarity between the cancer exome and pathogen DNA, at a scale of 4-5 amino acids. Finally, we investigated whether the considered mutational processes result in amino-acid changes with functional relevance that are more likely to be immunogenic. We showed that functional tolerance to mutagenic processes across species generally suggests more resilience to mutagenic processes that are due to exposure to elements of nature than to mutagenic processes that are due to exposure to cancer-causing artificial substances. These results support the idea that recognition of pathogen sequences as well as differential functional tolerance to mutagenic processes may play an important role in the immune recognition process involved in tumor infiltration by lymphocytes."
