https://openalex.org/W1654752245,"Understanding how the brain constructs movements remains a fundamental challenge in neuroscience. The brain may control complex movements through flexible combination of motor primitives, where each primitive is an element of computation in the sensorimotor map that transforms desired limb trajectories into motor commands. Theoretical studies have shown that a system's ability to learn action depends on the shape of its primitives. Using a time-series analysis of error patterns, here we show that humans learn the dynamics of reaching movements through a flexible combination of primitives that have gaussian-like tuning functions encoding hand velocity. The wide tuning of the inferred primitives predicts limitations on the brain's ability to represent viscous dynamics. We find close agreement between the predicted limitations and the subjects' adaptation to new force fields. The mathematical properties of the derived primitives resemble the tuning curves of Purkinje cells in the cerebellum. The activity of these cells may encode primitives that underlie the learning of dynamics."

https://openalex.org/W2127314614,"Although estrogen is known to activate endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) in the vascular endothelium, the molecular mechanism responsible for this effect remains to be elucidated. In studies of both human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) and simian virus 40-transformed rat lung vascular endothelial cells (TRLECs), 17β-estradiol (E2), but not 17α-E2, caused acute activation of eNOS that was unaffected by actinomycin D and was specifically blocked by the pure estrogen receptor antagonist ICI-182,780. Treatment of both TRLECs and HUVECs with 17β-E2 stimulated the activation of Akt, and the PI3K inhibitor wortmannin blocked the 17β-E2-induced activation of Akt. 17β-E2-induced Akt activation was also inhibited by ICI-182,780, but not by actinomycin D. Either treatment with wortmannin or exogenous expression of a dominant negative Akt in TRLECs decreased the 17β-E2-induced eNOS activation. Moreover, 17β-E2-induced Akt activation actually enhances the phosphorylation of eNOS. 17β-E2-induced Akt activation was dependent on both extracellular and intracellular Ca2+. We further examined the 17β-E2-induced Akt activity in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells transiently transfected with cDNAs for estrogen receptor α (ERα) or estrogen receptor β (ERβ). 17β-E2 stimulated the activation of Akt in CHO cells expressing ERα but not in CHO cells expressing ERβ. Our findings suggest that 17β-E2 induced eNOS activation through an Akt-dependent mechanism, which is mediated by ERα via a nongenomic mechanism.

The incidence of atherosclerotic diseases is lower in premenopausal women than in men, steeply rises in postmenopausal women, and is reduced to premenopausal levels in postmenopausal women who receive estrogen therapy (10Barrett-Connor E.

Until recently, the atheroprotective effects of estrogen were attributed principally to the effects on serum lipid concentrations. However, estrogen-induced alterations in serum lipids account for only approximately one-third of the observed clinical benefits of estrogen (12Grady D. Rubin S.M. Petitti D.B. Fox C.S. Black D.

Recent evidence suggests that the direct actions of estrogen on blood vessels contribute to the cardioprotective effects of estrogen (13Mendelsohn M.E. Karas R.H. Curr. Opin. Cardiol. 1994; 9: 619-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar, 15Farhat M.Y. Lavigne M.C. Ramwell P.W. FASEB J . 1996; 10: 615-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (579) Google Scholar). There are many kinds of direct effects of estrogen on blood vessels, such as estrogen-induced increases of vasodilatation and inhibition of the response of blood vessels to injury and the development of atherosclerosis. However, the molecular mechanism underlying the estrogen-induced vasodilatation has not yet been determined. Several studies suggest that a key mediator of this vasodilator response could be the endothelium-derived relaxing factor nitric oxide (NO), and that brief treatment with estrogen increases basal NO release in endothelial cells without elevation of eNOS mRNA or protein (16Lantin-Hermoso R.L. Rosenfeld C.R. Yuhanna I.S. Germian Z. Chen Z. Shaul P.W. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: 119-126PubMed Google Scholar). Estrogen activates endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) without altering expression of the eNOS gene in vascular endothelium (17Lantin-Hermoso R.L. Rosenfeld C.R. Yuhanna I.S. German Z. Chen Z.

However, the details of the mechanism of the estrogen-induced eNOS activation are not yet well understood. The serine/threonine kinase termed Akt or protein kinase B (PKB)1 is an important regulator of various cellular processes, including glucose metabolism and cell survival (21Coffer P.J. Jin J. Woodgett J.R. Biochem. J. 1998; 335: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (969) Google Scholar, 22Franke T.F. Kaplan D.R. Cantley L.C. Cell. 1997; 88: 435-437Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1528) Google Scholar). Activation of receptor tyrosine kinases and G-protein-coupled receptors, and stimulation of cells by mechanical force, can lead to the phosphorylation and activation of Akt (23Downward J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 262-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (1190) Google Scholar, 24Murga C. Laguinge L. Wetzker R. Cuadrado A. Gutkind J.S. J. Biol.

Akt may be regulated by both phosphorylation and the direct binding of PI3K lipid products to the Akt pleckstrin homology domain. Akt can then phosphorylate substrates such as glycogen synthase kinase-3, 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase, and BAD. More recently, it was found that eNOS is also an Akt substrate and is activated by Akt-dependent phosphorylation to release NO in endothelial cells (31Fulton D. Gratton J.P. McCabe T.J. Fontana J.

The actions of estrogen can be mediated by the classical nuclear receptors, ERα and ERβ (35Kuiper G.G. Enmark E. Pelto-Huikko M. Nilsson S. Gustafsson J-A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

By definition, rapid effects of estrogen that involve nongenomic mechanisms are independent of transcriptional activation by the nuclear ERs. These rapid effects are believed to be mediated by receptors located in or close to the plasma membrane (37Pietras R.J. Szego C.M. Nature. 1977; 265: 69-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (585) Google Scholar, 38Pietras R.J. Szego C.M. J. Steroid. Biochem. 1979; 11: 1471-1483Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Estrogen-induced vasodilatation occurs 5–20 min after estrogen administration (39Reis S.E. Gloth S.T. Blumenthal R.S. Resar J.R. Zacur H.A. Gerstenblith G. Brinker J.A.

HUVECs were isolated according to the method of Jaffeet al. (42Jaffe E.A. Nachman R.L. Becker C.G. Minick R.C. J. Clin.

HUVECs were used at passage 2 or 3. The vectors encoding the various HA-tagged forms of Akt, wild-type Akt (HA-Akt), kinase-inactive Akt (HA-AktK179M), and constitutively active Akt (HA-mΔ4–129Akt) used in this study have been described previously (26Dudek H.

Briefly, 10 μl of a sample was incubated for 10 min at 37 °C in a solution consisting of 50 mm HEPES, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm CaCl2, 0.1 mmtetrahydro-l-biopterin, 1 mm NADPH, 10 μg/ml calmodulin, 10 μm FAD, and 1.55 μml-[guanidino-14C]arginine (pH 7.8), in a final volume of 100 μl. The reaction was terminated by the addition of 200 μl of buffer A (100 mm HEPES, 10 mm EDTA, pH 5.2). The whole reaction mixture was then applied to a 0.3-ml Dowex 50-WX column (Na+ form, 200–400 mesh) that had been equilibrated with buffer A. Citrulline was eluted with 0.5 ml of buffer A, and then radioactivity was measured with a liquid scintillation counter.

Seventy-two hours after transfection, serum-deprived cells were incubated with 10−7m 17β-E2 for 15 min, and lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-HA antibody. The immunoprecipitated products were washed once in lysis buffer and twice in kinase assay buffer, and samples were resuspended in 30 μl of kinase assay buffer containing 40 μm[γ-32P]ATP (1 μCi) and 5 μg of partially purified eNOS, or 5 μg of recombinant wild-type or S1179A eNOS purified fromEscherichia coli. The kinase reaction was allowed to proceed at room temperature for 5 min and stopped by the addition of Laemmli SDS sample buffer (54Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar). Reaction products were resolved by 8% SDS-PAGE. Statistical analysis was performed using Student's t test, and p < 0.05 was considered significant. Data are expressed as the mean ± S.E. To evaluate whether eNOS is activated by 17β-E2 in TRLECs (Fig.1 A, upper panel) and HUVECs (Fig. 1 A, lower panel), cultured cells were exposed to 17β-E2 for the indicated times. The increase in eNOS activity induced by 10−7m 17β-E2 reached a plateau from 15 through 30 min and rapidly declined thereafter. The dose dependence of 17β-E2-induced eNOS activation was also evaluated in TRLECs (Fig. 1 B). TRLECs were treated with various concentrations of 17β-E2 for 15 min. In the range of 10−10 to 10−7m, 17β-E2 induced the activation of eNOS in a dose-dependent manner. A higher concentration (10−6m) of 17β-E2 did not induce a stronger response (data not shown). The response was specific for 17β-E2, because 17α-E2 had no effect (Fig.2 A). To determine whether this response involves rapid ER activation, the effect of concomitant treatment with the pure ER antagonist ICI-182,780 was determined (Fig.2 B). ICI-182,780 completely abolished the induction of eNOS activation by 17β-E2. Moreover, the effects of E2–17-BSA, a membrane-impermeable conjugate of E2, and actinomycin D, an inhibitor of gene transcription, were tested to rule out the influence of genomic events mediated by nuclear ERs (Fig. 2 C). E2–17-BSA stimulated an increase in eNOS activity similar to that induced by 17β-E2, and actinomycin D did not affect the induction of eNOS activation by 17β-E2.Figure 2Specificity of the augmentation of eNOS activation by 17β-E2.

Cell lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation with immobilized anti-Akt antibody, and then supplemented with GSK-3α fusion protein and analyzed by Western blotting with anti-phospho-GSK-3α/β antibody. Activation of Akt by 17β-E2 in both TRLECs and HUVECs reached a plateau at 15 min, and declined thereafter (Fig. 3 A). 17β-E2 induced the activation of Akt in a dose-dependent manner in TRLECs (Fig. 3 B) and HUVECs (data not shown).

TRLECs were stimulated with 17β-E2 in the presence or absence of wortmannin, a PI3K inhibitor, and the kinase activity of Akt was assayed. The induction of Akt activity by 17β-E2 was inhibited by wortmannin (Fig.4 B, lane 6). These results indicate that E2 activates Akt activity through a PI3K-dependent mechanism.Figure 4Specificity of the augmentation of Akt activation by 17β-E2. Cells were grown in 100-mm dishes.

We have used Far Western analysis and phosphopeptide competition assays to map the sites in the cytoplasmic domain of β4 that are required for interaction with Shc. Our results indicate that, upon phosphorylation, Tyr1440, or secondarily Tyr1422, interacts with the SH2 domain of Shc, whereas Tyr1526, or secondarily Tyr1642, interacts with its phosphotyrosine binding (PTB) domain. An inactivating mutation in the PTB domain of Shc, but not one in its SH2 domain, suppresses the activation of Shc by α6β4. In addition, mutation of β4 Tyr1526, which binds to the PTB domain of Shc, but not of Tyr1422 and Tyr1440, which interact with its SH2 domain, abolishes the activation of ERK by α6β4. Phenylalanine substitution of the β4 tyrosines able to interact with the SH2 or PTB domain of Shc does not affect incorporation of α6β4 in the hemidesmosomes of 804G cells. Exposure to the tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor orthovanadate increases tyrosine phosphorylation of β4 and disrupts the hemidesmosomes of 804G cells expressing recombinant wild type β4. This treatment, however, exerts a decreasing degree of inhibition on the hemidesmosomes of cells expressing versions of β4containing phenylalanine substitutions at Tyr1422 and Tyr1440, at Tyr1526 and Tyr1642, or at all four tyrosine phosphorylation sites. These results suggest that β4 Tyr1526 interacts in a phosphorylation-dependent manner with the PTB domain of Shc. This event is required for subsequent tyrosine phosphorylation of Shc and signaling to ERK but not formation of hemidesmosomes.

Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 575-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). The α6β4 integrin is a major receptor for the basement membrane component laminin-5 and is expressed in a variety of epithelial cells, in Schwann cells, in certain endothelial cells, and in CD4− CD8− T cells (5Giancotti F.G. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 1165-1172Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6Borradori L. Sonnenberg A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 647-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). The cytoplasmic domain of β4, which is unusually long and dissimilar in amino acid sequence from the corresponding portions of other integrin β subunits, enables α6β4to recruit the adaptor protein Shc as well as to promote the assembly of hemidesmosomes (5Giancotti F.G. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 1165-1172Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6Borradori L. Sonnenberg A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 647-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Shc is an SH2/PTB1 domain adaptor protein that couples a variety of receptor and nonreceptor tyrosine kinases, cytokine receptors, immune receptors, and adhesion receptors to Ras signaling (7Bonfin L.

In most cases, Shc binds to upstream tyrosine phosphorylated molecules through its SH2 domain, PTB domain, or both. It is then phosphorylated on tyrosine and recruits the Grb2/SOS complex, which can subsequently activate Ras. By this mechanism, Shc participates in mediating the proliferative functions of many receptors. In addition, it regulates cell migration (9Pelicci G. Giordano S. Zhen Z. Salcini A.E. Lanfrancone L.

Although many receptor tyrosine kinases must interact directly with Shc to induce its tyrosine phosphorylation and activation, the EGF receptor is capable of signaling through Shc even when prevented from binding to it (12Li N. Schlessinger J. Margolis B. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 3457-3465PubMed Google Scholar, 13Yajnik V. Blaikie P. Bork P. Margolis B. J. Biol.

Mohammadi M. Schlessinger J. Giancotti F.G. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4470-4481Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar), a subset of β1 and αv integrins recruit Shc indirectly through Src family kinases (15Wary K.K. Mainiero F. Isakoff S.J.

Cell. 1998; 94: 625-634Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (612) Google Scholar). Dominant negative studies suggest that Shc is required to couple the α6β4 integrin to Ras and thereby both the Raf-ERK and Rac-JNK signaling cascades. Through these pathways, α6β4 cooperates with growth factor receptors to promote immediate-early gene expression and progression through the G1 phase of the cell cycle (17Mainiero F. Murgia C. Wary K.K. Curatola A.M. Pepe A. Blumemberg M. Westwick J.K. Der C.J. Giancotti F.G. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2365-2375Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). Mice carrying a targeted deletion of the cytoplasmic domain of β4display proliferative defects in the skin and gastro-intestinal tract, suggesting that signaling pathways activated by the cytoplasmic domain of β4, probably through Shc, are required for optimal epithelial cell proliferation in vivo (18Murgia C. Blaikie P. Kim N. Dans M. Petrie H.T. Giancotti F.G. EMBO. 1998; 17: 3940-3951Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). In addition to its signaling function, the cytoplasmic domain of β4 plays a crucial role in the assembly of hemidesmosomes (18Murgia C. Blaikie P. Kim N. Dans M. Petrie H.T. Giancotti F.G. EMBO. 1998; 17: 3940-3951Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 19Spinardi L. Ren Y.L. Sanders R. Giancotti F.G. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1993; 4: 871-884Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). The hemidesmosomes are adhesive junctions that mediate stable attachment of stratified and transitional epithelia to the basement membrane. They differ from focal adhesions because they are linked to the keratin instead of the actin cytoskeleton. In accordance with the role of hemidesmosomes in mediating strong adhesion to the basement membrane, defects in hemidesmosome integrity cause epidermal fragility and skin blistering (6Borradori L. Sonnenberg A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 647-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar, 20Pulkkinen L. Uitto J. Matrix Biol. 1999; 18: 29-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). The assembly of hemidesmosomes is likely to require interaction of the cytoplasmic domain of β4 with HD1/plectin and BPAG2 (21Borradori L. Koch P.J. Niessen C.M. Erkeland S. van Leusden M.R.

Recent studies have indicated that ligation of α6β4 promotes phosphorylation of the β4 cytoplasmic domain through activation of an integrin-associated Src family kinase. 2L. Gagnoux-Palacios, M. Dans, W. van t'Hoff, M. Resh, and F. G. Giancotti, manuscript in preparation., 3A. Mariotti, P. Kedeshian, M. Dans, A.M. Curatola, L. Gagnoux-Palacios, and F. G. Giancotti, manuscript in preparation. Because Src kinases are known to activate Shc (24van der Geer P. Wiley S. Gish G.D. Lai V.K. Stephens R. White M.F. Kaplan D. Pawson T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 963-968Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), it is possible that α6β4 activates Shc through the integrin-associated Src kinase independently of direct binding of Shc to the cytoplasmic domain of β4. We have thus examined whether α6β4-mediated Shc signaling requires direct binding of Shc to the β4cytoplasmic domain. Our results indicate that the SH2 and PTB domain of Shc bind to separate phosphotyrosines in the cytoplasmic domain of β4. The interaction mediated by the PTB domain is essential for Shc signaling to ERK in vivo, whereas that mediated by the SH2 domain is dispensable. In addition, we provide evidence that phosphorylation of the Shc binding sites in β4 antagonizes formation of hemidesmosomes.

Cancer Res. 1981; 41: 405-409PubMed Google Scholar) were cultured in DMEM with 10% FBS and transfected by electroporation at 260 V and 975 microfarads in 300 μl of PBS, 1.25% Me2SO with 10 μg of pcDNA3 β4 and 10 μg of pBS. They were then replated onto gelatin-coated dishes in DMEM 10% FBS containing 1.25% Me2SO and cultured for additional 24 h. Stably transfected cells were selected with 400 μg/ml G418 (Life Technologies, Inc.) and maintained in 200 μg/ml G418. Clones were pooled and β4 expressing cells were selected by detaching cells with PBS/2 mm EDTA until cells rounded followed by brief treatment with 0.2% trypsin/EDTA and collection in DMEM, 10% FBS. Cells were then panned for 5 min at 37 °C over dishes coated overnight at 4 °C with 20 μg/ml 3E1 mAb followed by blocking with 1% heat-inactivated BSA. Adherent cells were allowed to grow until confluency. Cells expressing equivalent levels of human recombinant β4 were obtained by fluorescence-activated cell sorting with the 3E1 mAb. GST fusion proteins were expressed in BL21-RES cells (Stratagene) treated with 0.1 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 3 h at 37 °C and purified on glutathione-agarose as described previously (28Batzer A.G. Rotin D. Urena J.M. Skolnik E.Y. Schlessinger J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5192-5201Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Proteins were eluted by incubating glutathione-agarose beads three times for 5 min at room temperature with an equal volume of 100 mm Tris, pH 8.5, 120 mm sodium chloride, 0.1% Triton X-100, and freshly added 20 mm glutathione. Aliquots were stored frozen at −20 °C until use. After overnight serum starvation, 293T cells were left untreated or treated for 5 min at 37 °C with 100 μm orthovanadate and 3 mm hydrogen peroxide, washed with ice-cold PBS, and lysed in lysis buffer (50 mmHepes, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm EGTA, 5 mm EDTA) supplemented with phosphatase inhibitors (1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 25 mm sodium fluoride) and protease inhibitors (10 μg/ml pepstatin A, aprotinin, and leupeptin and 0.4 mm 4-(2-aminoethyl)-benzene sulfonylfluoride). Aliquots containing 1 mg of total proteins were immunoprecipitated for 3 h with 5 μg of 3E1 plus 30 μl of packed protein-G agarose. Immunocomplexes were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose. Membranes were blocked with TBS, 0.1% Tween (TBST) containing 5% milk for 1 h at room temperature and incubated with 1 μg/ml GST Shc SH2 or PTB domain fusion proteins in TBST-2.5% milk, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, leupeptin, and pepstatin A. After three washes with TBST, the membranes were incubated with 1 μg/ml anti-GST rabbit polyclonal antibody in TBST-2.5% milk, washed again, and then incubated with protein A-HRP in TBST-5% milk. After five washes with TBST and two washes with TBST-0.2% Triton X-100, the membranes were rinsed with TBS and incubated with ECL for 1 min before exposure to film. To assess phosphorylation of β4, the membranes were stripped for 30 min at 50 °C in 62.5 mm Tris, pH 6.7, 2% SDS, and 100 mm β-mercaptoethanol, rinsed extensively with TBS, and then probed by immunoblotting with RC20 according to the manufacturer's recommendations. To control for equal levels of β4, membranes were stripped again, blocked with TBST, 5% milk and probed by immunoblotting with 1 μg/ml anti-β4exo in TBS, 3% BSA followed by protein A-HRP. HaCat cells were serum starved and stimulated as described above. β4 was immunoprecipitated with the 3E1 mAb from lysates containing 2 mg of total proteins and transferred to nitrocellulose. Membranes were cut, and Far Western blotting was performed as above in the absence or presence of various concentrations of peptides. Purified phosphorylated (pY) or nonphosphorylated peptides were produced by the Microchemistry Core Facility of Sloan-Kettering Institute. They included β4 pY1422 (LTRDpYNSLTRSE), β4 pY1440 (LPRDpYSTLTSVS), β4 pY1526 (DLLPNHSpYVFRV), β4 Y1526 (DLLPNHSYVFRV), and β4 pY1642 (GLSENVPpYKFKV). Phosphopeptides modeled after the high affinity binding site for the SH2 domain of Shc at Tyr579 in the platelet-derived growth factor receptor (DGHEpYIYVDPMQ) and after the high affinity binding site for the PTB domain of Shc in the middle T antigen (SLLSNPTpYSVMR) (29Batzer A.G.

To examine tyrosine phosphorylation of Shc, the cells were serum starved, detached with 2 mm EDTA, washed with DMEM, 0.2% BSA, resuspended at 107/ml in DMEM, 0.2% BSA, and subdivided in 300-μl aliquots. Cells were incubated on ice for 40 min with 10 μg of anti-β4 mAb 3E1, washed with 700 μl of cold DMEM, resuspended in 200 μl of cold DMEM containing 5 μg of horse anti-mouse IgG, and incubated at 37 °C for 5 min. After one wash with cold PBS, the cells were pelleted and lysed in 800 μl of lysis buffer with phosphatase and protease inhibitors. Recombinant Shc proteins were immunoprecipitated with a rabbit anti-Myc polyclonal antibody, separated by SDS-PAGE, and transferred to nitrocellulose. The membranes were probed by immunoblotting with 1 μg/ml of biotin-conjugated 4G10 followed by streptavidin-HRP. To examine tyrosine phosphorylation of β4, HUVECs were transfected with mutant versions of β4 as described above, allowed to recover for 24 h, serum starved overnight, and treated with 1 μm sodium orthovanadate and 3 mm hydrogen peroxide. After extraction in lysis buffer, β4 was immunoprecipitated with 5 μg of 3E1 mAb and 30 μl of protein G-agarose, and probed by immunoblotting with RC20. Dishes were coated with 10 μg/ml rabbit anti-mouse IgGs for 2 h at room temperature, saturated with 0.5% heat-denatured BSA (fatty acid, globulin-free), and then incubated with 20 μg/ml 3E1 mAb overnight at 4 °C. Serum starved cells were detached with 2 mm EDTA, washed with DMEM, 0.2% BSA, and kept in suspension in DMEM, 0.2% BSA for 1 h at 37 °C. They were then plated onto 3E1-coated dishes for indicated times at 37 °C and lysed in RIPA buffer (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 10% glycerol, 1 mm EGTA, 4 mm EDTA, and phosphatase and protease inhibitors). Aliquots containing 20 μg of total proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and probed by immunoblotting with an antibodies to phospho-ERK. 804G cells were cultured on glass coverslips for 24 h in DMEM, 10% FBS and then overnight in DMEM, 1% FBS in the presence of the indicated concentrations of sodium orthovanadate. The cells were fixed with methanol at −20 °C for 20 min and stained with 10 μg/ml 3E1 mAb followed by 2 μg/ml FITC-conjugated anti-mouse IgGs. Samples were examined with a Zeiss fluorescent microscope. GST pull-down assays with SDS-denatured extracts have shown that the isolated SH2 and PTB domain of Shc can interact directly with the tyrosine phosphorylated β4 subunit in vitro (17Mainiero F. Murgia C. Wary K.K. Curatola A.M. Pepe A. Blumemberg M. Westwick J.K. Der C.J. Giancotti F.G. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2365-2375Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). To identify the sequences of β4cytoplasmic domain mediating the interaction with the SH2 and the PTB domain of Shc, we initially transfected 293T cells with the constructs encoding the wild type or deleted β4 subunits illustrated in Fig. 1. Antibody or laminin-5-mediated ligation of α6β4 promotes tyrosine phosphorylation of β4 in vivo, but this event is rapidly reversed, presumably by tyrosine phosphatases. By contrast, treatment of the cells with the tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor pervanadate causes high level and persistent tyrosine phosphorylation of β4. We thus used this protocol to increase tyrosine phosphorylation of β4 in mapping experiments. After immunoprecipitation from cells treated with pervanadate, α6β4 was separated by SDS-PAGE and probed by Far Western blotting with GST fusion proteins containing the SH2 or PTB domain of Shc or by immunoblotting with anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies. As shown in Fig.2 A, the SH2 domain of Shc bound to wild type β4 and to β4 mutants containing the connecting segment (E and M) in a tyrosine phosphorylation-dependent manner. It did not, however, bind to mutants lacking the connecting segment (G and I), despite the fact that they were still phosphorylated on tyrosine. We consistently observed that the mutants E and M, which lack the membrane proximal region of the cytoplasmic domain, were phosphorylated to a higher stoichiometry than wild type β4. It is possible that the segment deleted in E and M is necessary for efficient association with a tyrosine phosphatase able to reverse β4phosphorylation. Alternatively, the deletion may bring some of the β4 tyrosine phosphorylation sites in closer proximity to the tyrosine kinase that phosphorylates them. The mutants truncated after the second fibronectin (Fn) type III repeat (J and C) did not become phosphorylated on tyrosine. Because these mutants can still associate with Src kinases,2 it is likely that the major tyrosine phosphorylation sites in β4 reside downstream of the second Fn type III module. Taken together, these observations suggest that the SH2 domain of Shc binds to phosphorylated tyrosines located within the connecting segment of β4. The connecting segment contains two potential tyrosine phosphorylation sites that conform to the consensus for binding to the SH2 domain of Shc (31Songyang Z. Shoelson S.E. McGlade J. Olivier P. Pawson T. Bustelo X.R. Barbacid M. Sabe H. Hanafusa H. Yi T. Ren R. Baltimore D. Ratnofsky S. Feldman R.A. Cantley L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2777-2785Crossref PubMed Scopus (833) Google Scholar). We thus mutated these two tyrosines (Tyr1422 and Tyr1440) to phenylalanine either separately or in combination. The resulting versions of β4 were tested for their ability to bind the SH2 domain of Shc. Fig. 2 A shows that the SH2 domain of Shc does not bind to β4Y1422F/Y1440F and binds to a modest extent to β4 Y1440F. By contrast, the SH2 domain of Shc interacts effectively with β4 Y1422F. These results suggest that the SH2 domain of Shc binds primarily to phosphorylated Tyr1440 and secondarily to phosphorylated Tyr1422 in the connecting segment of β4. The PTB domain of Shc binds to phosphorylated tyrosines in the context of N XXY motifs (24van der Geer P. Wiley S. Gish G.D. Lai V.K. Stephens R. White M.F. Kaplan D. Pawson T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 963-968Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 29Batzer A.G. Blaikie P. Nelson K. Schlessinger J. Margolis B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4403-4409Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). The cytoplasmic domain of β4 contains three N XXY motifs: one in the region between the transmembrane domain and the first Fn type III module and the other two downstream of the connecting segment, one in the third and the other in the fourth Fn type III repeat. As shown in Fig. 2 B, the PTB domain of Shc bound to phosphorylated β4 mutant E as effectively as to phosphorylated wild type β4, but it did not interact with phosphorylated mutant M. This result suggests that the major binding site for the PTB domain of Shc in β4 resides downstream of the connecting segment and possibly corresponds to the N XXY motif in the third or that in the fourth Fn type III repeat. Therefore, versions of β4 containing phenylalanine substitutions of the tyrosines within each of these two N XXY sites (Tyr1526 and Tyr1642) were analyzed by Far Western blotting with the Shc PTB domain (Fig. 2 B). Phenylalanine substitution of either Tyr1526 or Tyr1642 decreased only partially binding of the PTB domain to β4, with substitution of Tyr1526 resulting in a significantly greater reduction. Mutation of both sites in combination (Y1526F/Y1642F) completely prevented the binding of PTB domain to β4. These results suggest that the PTB domain of Shc binds primarily to Tyr1526 and secondarily to Tyr1642 in β4. Phosphopeptide competition assays were performed to compare the relative affinities of the potential binding sites for the SH2 or PTB domain of Shc in β4 (see TableI for peptide sequences). For these experiments, we used HaCat keratinocytes, which express endogenous α6β4. Cells were either left untreated or treated with pervanadate. After immunoprecipitation, β4was transferred to nitrocellulose and probed with GST fusion proteins containing the SH2 or PTB domain of Shc in the absence or presence of tyrosin"
https://openalex.org/W2069867390,"Abstract Voltage-dependent anion channels (VDACs) form the main pathway for metabolites across the mitochondrial outer membrane. The mouse vdac1 gene has been disrupted by gene targeting, and the resulting mutant mice have been examined for defects in muscle physiology. To test the hypothesis that VDAC1 constitutes a pathway for ADP translocation into mitochondria, the apparent mitochondrial sensitivity for ADP (K m (ADP)) and the calculated rate of respiration in the presence of the maximal ADP concentration (V max) have been assessed using skinned fibers prepared from two oxidative muscles (ventricle and soleus) and a glycolytic muscle (gastrocnemius) in control andvdac1 − /− mice. We observed a significant increase in the apparentK m (ADP) in heart and gastrocnemius, whereas the V max remained unchanged in both muscles. In contrast, a significant decrease in both the apparentK m (ADP) andV max was observed in soleus. To test whether VDAC1 is required for creatine stimulation of mitochondrial respiration in oxidative muscles, the apparentK m (ADP) andV max were determined in the presence of 25 mm creatine. The creatine effect on mitochondrial respiration was unchanged in both heart and soleus. These data, together with the significant increase in citrate synthase activity in heart, but not in soleus and gastrocnemius, suggest that distinct metabolic responses to altered mitochondrial outer membrane permeability occur in these different striated muscle types."

ECT, a cytidylyltransferase, and EPT, an amino alcohol phosphotransferase, catalyze the subsequent two steps, and together these three enzymes constitute the de novo pathway for PtdEtn formation. The decarboxylation of PtdSer is an alternate route for PtdEtn production and is functionally important in cultured cell lines (1Voelker D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

PtdEtn is an abundant phospholipid in eucaryotic cell membranes, and the ECT reaction is thought to be a major regulator of its synthesis (7Bladergroen B.A. van Golde L.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1348: 91-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). EKI has been proposed as a regulatory step based on theoretical considerations (8Infante J.P. Biochem.

J. 1992; 283: 55-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) demonstrate that the supply of ethanolamine limits the rate of PtdEtn production at concentrations below 30 μm. Only at higher concentrations of ethanolamine does accumulation of phosphoethanolamine occur, indicating ECT as the rate-limiting enzyme of the pathway. On the contrary, McMaster and Choy (10McMaster C.R. Choy P.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1124: 13-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) report that the EKI step is rate-limiting with increased ethanolamine concentrations using a hamster heart perfusion model. Both studies agree that the rate of PtdEtn synthesis is dependent on the extracellular ethanolamine concentration (9Houweling M. Tijburg L.B. Vaartjes W.J. van Golde L.M. Biochem.

Vaartjes W.J. van Golde L.M. Biochem. J. 1992; 283: 55-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar).There is a long standing discussion as to the number and specificity of the enzymes that catalyze the phosphorylation of ethanolamine and choline. In yeast, there are two enzymes that are able to phosphorylate choline and ethanolamine, and these enzymes are annotated based on their preferred substrate specificities. The CKI enzyme has a specific activity 3.6-fold higher with choline compared with ethanolamine. The EKI enzyme has a specificity constant for ethanolamine 2-fold higher than that for choline (11Kim K. Kim K.H. Storey M.K. Voelker D.R. Carman G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14857-14866Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). CKIs have been purified from several mammalian tissues. Preparations from rat kidney (12Ishidate K. Furusawa K. Nakazawa Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1985; 836: 119-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), liver, and brain (13Uchida T. Yamashita S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1043: 281-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) exhibit significant ethanolamine kinase activity with computed ratios of CKI to EKI activity of 1.4, 3.7, and 1.3, respectively. A mammalian CKI cDNA clone also encodes an enzyme with dual specificity (14Aoyama C. Nakashima K. Matsui M. Ishidate K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1390: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), and additional highly homologous CKI clones have been identified (15Uchida T. Yamashita S. J. Biol.

These results suggest that in mammals both activities reside on the same protein.However, the existence of mammalian ethanolamine-specific kinases cannot be excluded by the data. Ethanolamine-specific kinase activities have been identified (17Upreti R.K. Sanwal G.G. Krishnan P.S. Arch. Biochem.

EKI activities 1 and 2 isolated from rat liver are separable distinct proteins (21Weinhold P.A. Rethy V.B. Biochemistry. 1974; 13: 5135-5141Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). EKI1 is estimated to be 36 kDa and does not exhibit CKI activity (21Weinhold P.A. Rethy V.B. Biochemistry. 1974; 13: 5135-5141Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). EKI2 is estimated to be 160 kDa and prefers ethanolamine but also has significant CKI activity (21Weinhold P.A. Rethy V.B. Biochemistry. 1974; 13: 5135-5141Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). An EKI of 42 kDa has been purified from human liver with a 5-fold preference for ethanolamine compared with choline (19Draus E. Niefind J. Vietor K. Havsteen B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1045: 195-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar), and also an EKI activity of 86 kDa has been identified from rat liver and HeLa cells using an antibody raised against the Drosophila EKI (20Uchida T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1349: 13-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). The discovery of theDrosophila EKI (22Pavlidis P. Ramaswami M. Tanouye M.A. Cell. 1994; 79: 23-33Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar) encoded by the eas gene establishes the existence of an ethanolamine-specific kinase in higher eucaryotes. Expression of the eas gene product as a glutathione S-transferase-fusion protein inEscherichia coli reveals a kinase that is highly specific for ethanolamine with negligible CKI activity (20Uchida T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1349: 13-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). A defect in theDrosophila eas results in a bang-sensitive paralytic phenotype, although the molecular link between the absence of the ethanolamine kinase activity and the physiological abnormality has not been established (22Pavlidis P. Ramaswami M. Tanouye M.A. Cell. 1994; 79: 23-33Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar).In the present study, we identify a human kinase that is highly specific for ethanolamine (EKI1). Moreover, we demonstrate that EKI1 overexpression accelerates PtdEtn biosynthesis as a function of the exogenous ethanolamine, whereas it has no effect on PtdCho formation.DISCUSSIONThe biochemical characterization of EKI1 reveals the existence of a specific EKI enzyme in mammalian cells. The humanEKI1 cDNA encodes a protein with high specificity for ethanolamine (Figs. 4, A and B). The EKI1 preference for ethanolamine holds true in vivo as well where there is a dramatic stimulation of phosphoethanolamine formation (Fig.6) and an increased PtdEtn radiolabeling (Fig. 5) in contrast to the lack of any significant change in PtdCho biosynthesis (Fig. 7). EKI1 may be identical to the mammalian ethanolamine-specific kinase activities described previously (19Draus E. Niefind J. Vietor K. Havsteen B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1045: 195-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar, 21Weinhold P.A. Rethy V.B. Biochemistry. 1974; 13: 5135-5141Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Weinhold and Rethy (21Weinhold P.A. Rethy V.B. Biochemistry. 1974; 13: 5135-5141Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) partially purified an EKI activity with a molecular size of 36 kDa from rat liver that exhibited no CKI activity. Draus et al. (19Draus E. Niefind J. Vietor K. Havsteen B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1045: 195-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar) also reported the partial purification of a 42-kDa enzyme from human liver that had a relatively high ratio (∼5) of EKI to CKI activities. The EKI1 clone reported in this paper encodes a protein with a predicted molecular size of 49.7 kDa (Fig. 1) and may correspond to the enzymes described above.We also report the existence of a second gene that is highly similar toEKI1, which we call EKI2. EKI1 and EKI2α proteins are 47% identical and 59% similar. EKI1 is 32% identical and 11% similar, whereas EKI2α is 29% identical and 38% similar to the Drosophila Eas protein. Based on the above comparison, it is difficult to definitely state which form is the mammalian homologue of the eas gene. However, there is emerging support for a family of EKI genes that is distinct from the CKI gene family, which encodes dual specificity enzymes. The existence of a mammalian ethanolamine-specific kinase has been a point of discussion due to the characterization of CKI activities that also exhibit significant EKI activity (12Ishidate K. Furusawa K. Nakazawa Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1985; 836: 119-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 13Uchida T. Yamashita S. Biochim. Biophys.

The physiological significance of this gene family remains to be established, although the Drosophila bang-sensitive phenotype of the eas mutant points to a critical role for PtdEtn or PtdEtn turnover via the CDP-ethanolamine pathway in neural function. Three cDNAs from rat tissues have been shown to encode CKI activities. Rat CKI1 protein (435 amino acids) and CKI2 protein (453 amino acids) are splice variants and are expressed in the liver (15Uchida T. Yamashita S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 10156-10162Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Uchida T. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1994; 116: 508-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The rat liver CKI biochemically purified by Porter and Kent (24Porter T.J. Kent C. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 414-422Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) exhibits dual reactivity with choline and ethanolamine, has a molecular mass of 47 kDa, and probably corresponds to one of the rat CKI1 or CKI2 isoforms. A third cDNA, CKI3, isolated from the rat kidney is the product of a second gene (14Aoyama C. Nakashima K. Matsui M. Ishidate K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1390: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Rat CKI3 has been expressed in E. coli and demonstrated to encode an enzyme that phosphorylates choline with a 6-fold higher specific activity than ethanolamine (14Aoyama C. Nakashima K. Matsui M. Ishidate K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1390: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Two CKI clones from mouse embryo are homologous with the two rat genes (28Aoyama C. Nakashima K. Ishidate K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1393: 179-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Therefore, there are at least two genes encoding CKI in rat and mouse, although only one human CKI has been characterized thus far (29Hosaka K. Tanaka S. Nikawa J. Yamashita S. FEBS Lett. 1992; 304: 229-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Also, the recently reported yeast gene encoding the EKI protein has about twice the EKI activity compared with CKI (11Kim K. Kim K.H. Storey M.K. Voelker D.R. Carman G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14857-14866Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Until now, only the Drosophila eas gene has been demonstrated to encode a kinase with a high specificity for ethanolamine (20Uchida T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1349: 13-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar).EKI plays a role in controlling PtdEtn biosynthesis. The rate of PtdEtn biosynthesis is a function of the availability of exogenous ethanolamine (10McMaster C.R. Choy P.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1124: 13-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), thus implicating a role for EKI. However, this hypothesis has not been tested, and a prevalent view of the CDP-ethanolamine pathway is that the ECT is the regulated step (30Tijburg L.B. Geelen M.J. van Golde L.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 1004: 1-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). The stimulation of PtdEtn formation by EKI1 overexpression was not anticipated, and the data demonstrate that EKI as well as ECT are important metabolic control points. The majority of the ethanolamine radiolabel accumulates as phosphoethanolamine with a 20-fold increase over control, indicating that the ECT remains a key rate-limiting enzyme. The stimulatory effect of EKI1overexpression is evident when ethanolamine supplementation approaches physiological concentrations (9Houweling M. Tijburg L.B. Vaartjes W.J. van Golde L.M. Biochem. J. 1992; 283: 55-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), indicating that the level of phosphoethanolamine is important in pushing the ethanolamine substrate through to PtdEtn. The concentration of cellular phosphoethanolamine is controlled by the availability of ethanolamine and EKI1 protein levels. These data suggest that the regulation of EKI expression and/or activity may contribute to determining PtdEtn biosynthesis by the CDP-ethanolamine pathway in different cell types, and this is consistent with the reduced level of PtdEtn in the Drosophila eas mutant (22Pavlidis P. Ramaswami M. Tanouye M.A. Cell. 1994; 79: 23-33Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar).Our results indicate a mechanism for PtdEtn homeostasis that is similar to the one that controls cellular PtdCho levels (31Baburina I. Jackowski S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9400-9408Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Increased glycerophosphoethanolamine was associated with stimulated PtdEtn synthesis in response to EKI1 overexpression (Fig. 4). Earlier work from our laboratory indicated that excessive phospholipid synthesis is balanced by degradation to the glycerophosphobase to maintain homeostatic levels of membrane lipid (31Baburina I. Jackowski S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9400-9408Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar, 32Barbour S.E. Kapur A. Deal C.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1439: 77-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). These results are consistent with the lack of an effect on the radiolabeling of PtdEtn with [3H]serine with EKI1 overexpression and suggest that the contribution of the decarboxylation of PtdSer to PtdEtn biosynthesis is not down-regulated by the activity of the CDP-ethanolamine pathway. Ethanolamine kinase or EKI1 (ATP:ethanolamineO-phosphotransferase, EC 2.7.1.82) catalyzes the first step of PtdEtn biosynthesis via the CDP-Etn pathway. ECT, a cytidylyltransferase, and EPT, an amino alcohol phosphotransferase, catalyze the subsequent two steps, and together these three enzymes constitute the de novo pathway for PtdEtn formation. The decarboxylation of PtdSer is an alternate route for PtdEtn production and is functionally important in cultured cell lines (1Voelker D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 2669-2673Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 2Miller M.A. Kent C. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 9753-9761Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), although the CDP-Etn pathway is considered a major route for PtdEtn synthesis in most mammalian tissues (3Zelinski T.A. Choy P.C. Can. J. Biochem. 1982; 60: 817-823Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 4Sundler R. Åkesson B. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 3359-3367Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 5Arthur G. Page L. Biochem. J. 1991; 273: 121-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 6Xu Z.L. Byers D.M. Palmer F.B. Spence M.W. Cook H.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 2143-2150Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). PtdEtn is an abundant phospholipid in eucaryotic cell membranes, and the ECT reaction is thought to be a major regulator of its synthesis (7Bladergroen B.A. van Golde L.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1348: 91-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). EKI has been proposed as a regulatory step based on theoretical considerations (8Infante J.P. Biochem. J. 1977; 167: 847-849Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). However, experimental investigations result in conflicting conclusions. Experiments performed with rat hepatocytes (4Sundler R. Åkesson B. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 3359-3367Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,9Houweling M. Tijburg L.B. Vaartjes W.J. van Golde L.M. Biochem. J. 1992; 283: 55-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) demonstrate that the supply of ethanolamine limits the rate of PtdEtn production at concentrations below 30 μm. Only at higher concentrations of ethanolamine does accumulation of phosphoethanolamine occur, indicating ECT as the rate-limiting enzyme of the pathway. On the contrary, McMaster and Choy (10McMaster C.R. Choy P.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1124: 13-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) report that the EKI step is rate-limiting with increased ethanolamine concentrations using a hamster heart perfusion model. Both studies agree that the rate of PtdEtn synthesis is dependent on the extracellular ethanolamine concentration (9Houweling M. Tijburg L.B. Vaartjes W.J. van Golde L.M. Biochem. J. 1992; 283: 55-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 10McMaster C.R. Choy P.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1124: 13-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) and that the stimulation of PtdEtn biosynthesis occurs at physiological levels of 20–50 μm (9Houweling M. Tijburg L.B. Vaartjes W.J. van Golde L.M. Biochem. J. 1992; 283: 55-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). There is a long standing discussion as to the number and specificity of the enzymes that catalyze the phosphorylation of ethanolamine and choline. In yeast, there are two enzymes that are able to phosphorylate choline and ethanolamine, and these enzymes are annotated based on their preferred substrate specificities. The CKI enzyme has a specific activity 3.6-fold higher with choline compared with ethanolamine. The EKI enzyme has a specificity constant for ethanolamine 2-fold higher than that for choline (11Kim K. Kim K.H. Storey M.K. Voelker D.R. Carman G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14857-14866Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). CKIs have been purified from several mammalian tissues. Preparations from rat kidney (12Ishidate K. Furusawa K. Nakazawa Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1985; 836: 119-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), liver, and brain (13Uchida T. Yamashita S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1043: 281-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) exhibit significant ethanolamine kinase activity with computed ratios of CKI to EKI activity of 1.4, 3.7, and 1.3, respectively. A mammalian CKI cDNA clone also encodes an enzyme with dual specificity (14Aoyama C. Nakashima K. Matsui M. Ishidate K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1390: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), and additional highly homologous CKI clones have been identified (15Uchida T. Yamashita S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 10156-10162Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Uchida T. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1994; 116: 508-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). These results suggest that in mammals both activities reside on the same protein. However, the existence of mammalian ethanolamine-specific kinases cannot be excluded by the data. Ethanolamine-specific kinase activities have been identified (17Upreti R.K. Sanwal G.G. Krishnan P.S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1976; 174: 658-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 18Brophy P.J. Choy P.C. Toone J.R. Vance D.E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1977; 78: 491-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 19Draus E. Niefind J. Vietor K. Havsteen B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1045: 195-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar, 20Uchida T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1349: 13-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar) and partially purified. EKI activities 1 and 2 isolated from rat liver are separable distinct proteins (21Weinhold P.A. Rethy V.B. Biochemistry. 1974; 13: 5135-5141Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). EKI1 is estimated to be 36 kDa and does not exhibit CKI activity (21Weinhold P.A. Rethy V.B. Biochemistry. 1974; 13: 5135-5141Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). EKI2 is estimated to be 160 kDa and prefers ethanolamine but also has significant CKI activity (21Weinhold P.A. Rethy V.B. Biochemistry. 1974; 13: 5135-5141Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). An EKI of 42 kDa has been purified from human liver with a 5-fold preference for ethanolamine compared with choline (19Draus E. Niefind J. Vietor K. Havsteen B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1045: 195-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar), and also an EKI activity of 86 kDa has been identified from rat liver and HeLa cells using an antibody raised against the Drosophila EKI (20Uchida T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1349: 13-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). The discovery of theDrosophila EKI (22Pavlidis P. Ramaswami M. Tanouye M.A. Cell. 1994; 79: 23-33Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar) encoded by the eas gene establishes the existence of an ethanolamine-specific kinase in higher eucaryotes. Expression of the eas gene product as a glutathione S-transferase-fusion protein inEscherichia coli reveals a kinase that is highly specific for ethanolamine with negligible CKI activity (20Uchida T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1349: 13-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). A defect in theDrosophila eas results in a bang-sensitive paralytic phenotype, although the molecular link between the absence of the ethanolamine kinase activity and the physiological abnormality has not been established (22Pavlidis P. Ramaswami M. Tanouye M.A. Cell. 1994; 79: 23-33Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). In the present study, we identify a human kinase that is highly specific for ethanolamine (EKI1). Moreover, we demonstrate that EKI1 overexpression accelerates PtdEtn biosynthesis as a function of the exogenous ethanolamine, whereas it has no effect on PtdCho formation. DISCUSSIONThe biochemical characterization of EKI1 reveals the existence of a specific EKI enzyme in mammalian cells. The humanEKI1 cDNA encodes a protein with high specificity for ethanolamine (Figs. 4, A and B). The EKI1 preference for ethanolamine holds true in vivo as well where there is a dramatic stimulation of phosphoethanolamine formation (Fig.6) and an increased PtdEtn radiolabeling (Fig. 5) in contrast to the lack of any significant change in PtdCho biosynthesis (Fig. 7). EKI1 may be identical to the mammalian ethanolamine-specific kinase activities described previously (19Draus E. Niefind J. Vietor K. Havsteen B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1045: 195-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar, 21Weinhold P.A. Rethy V.B. Biochemistry. 1974; 13: 5135-5141Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Weinhold and Rethy (21Weinhold P.A. Rethy V.B. Biochemistry. 1974; 13: 5135-5141Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) partially purified an EKI activity with a molecular size of 36 kDa from rat liver that exhibited no CKI activity. Draus et al. (19Draus E. Niefind J. Vietor K. Havsteen B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1045: 195-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar) also reported the partial purification of a 42-kDa enzyme from human liver that had a relatively high ratio (∼5) of EKI to CKI activities. The EKI1 clone reported in this paper encodes a protein with a predicted molecular size of 49.7 kDa (Fig. 1) and may correspond to the enzymes described above.We also report the existence of a second gene that is highly similar toEKI1, which we call EKI2. EKI1 and EKI2α proteins are 47% identical and 59% similar. EKI1 is 32% identical and 11% similar, whereas EKI2α is 29% identical and 38% similar to the Drosophila Eas protein. Based on the above comparison, it is difficult to definitely state which form is the mammalian homologue of the eas gene. However, there is emerging support for a family of EKI genes that is distinct from the CKI gene family, which encodes dual specificity enzymes. The existence of a mammalian ethanolamine-specific kinase has been a point of discussion due to the characterization of CKI activities that also exhibit significant EKI activity (12Ishidate K. Furusawa K. Nakazawa Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1985; 836: 119-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 13Uchida T. Yamashita S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1043: 281-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 24Porter T.J. Kent C. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 414-422Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The physiological significance of this gene family remains to be established, although the Drosophila bang-sensitive phenotype of the eas mutant points to a critical role for PtdEtn or PtdEtn turnover via the CDP-ethanolamine pathway in neural function. Three cDNAs from rat tissues have been shown to encode CKI activities. Rat CKI1 protein (435 amino acids) and CKI2 protein (453 amino acids) are splice variants and are expressed in the liver (15Uchida T. Yamashita S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 10156-10162Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Uchida T. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1994; 116: 508-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The rat liver CKI biochemically purified by Porter and Kent (24Porter T.J. Kent C. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 414-422Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) exhibits dual reactivity with choline and ethanolamine, has a molecular mass of 47 kDa, and probably corresponds to one of the rat CKI1 or CKI2 isoforms. A third cDNA, CKI3, isolated from the rat kidney is the product of a second gene (14Aoyama C. Nakashima K. Matsui M. Ishidate K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1390: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Rat CKI3 has been expressed in E. coli and demonstrated to encode an enzyme that phosphorylates choline with a 6-fold higher specific activity than ethanolamine (14Aoyama C. Nakashima K. Matsui M. Ishidate K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1390: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Two CKI clones from mouse embryo are homologous with the two rat genes (28Aoyama C. Nakashima K. Ishidate K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1393: 179-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Therefore, there are at least two genes encoding CKI in rat and mouse, although only one human CKI has been characterized thus far (29Hosaka K. Tanaka S. Nikawa J. Yamashita S. FEBS Lett. 1992; 304: 229-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Also, the recently reported yeast gene encoding the EKI protein has about twice the EKI activity compared with CKI (11Kim K. Kim K.H. Storey M.K. Voelker D.R. Carman G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14857-14866Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Until now, only the Drosophila eas gene has been demonstrated to encode a kinase with a high specificity for ethanolamine (20Uchida T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1349: 13-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar).EKI plays a role in controlling PtdEtn biosynthesis. The rate of PtdEtn biosynthesis is a function of the availability of exogenous ethanolamine (10McMaster C.R. Choy P.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1124: 13-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), thus implicating a role for EKI. However, this hypothesis has not been tested, and a prevalent view of the CDP-ethanolamine pathway is that the ECT is the regulated step (30Tijburg L.B. Geelen M.J. van Golde L.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 1004: 1-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). The stimulation of PtdEtn formation by EKI1 overexpression was not anticipated, and the data demonstrate that EKI as well as ECT are important metabolic control points. The majority of the ethanolamine radiolabel accumulates as phosphoethanolamine with a 20-fold increase over control, indicating that the ECT remains a key rate-limiting enzyme. The stimulatory effect of EKI1overexpression is evident when ethanolamine supplementation approaches physiological concentrations (9Houweling M. Tijburg L.B. Vaartjes W.J. van Golde L.M. Biochem. J. 1992; 283: 55-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), indicating that the level of phosphoethanolamine is important in pushing the ethanolamine substrate through to PtdEtn. The concentration of cellular phosphoethanolamine is controlled by the availability of ethanolamine and EKI1 protein levels. These data suggest that the regulation of EKI expression and/or activity may contribute to determining PtdEtn biosynthesis by the CDP-ethanolamine pathway in different cell types, and this is consistent with the reduced level of PtdEtn in the Drosophila eas mutant (22Pavlidis P. Ramaswami M. Tanouye M.A. Cell. 1994; 79: 23-33Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar).Our results indicate a mechanism for PtdEtn homeostasis that is similar to the one that controls cellular PtdCho levels (31Baburina I. Jackowski S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9400-9408Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Increased glycerophosphoethanolamine was associated with stimulated PtdEtn synthesis in response to EKI1 overexpression (Fig. 4). Earlier work from our laboratory indicated that excessive phospholipid synthesis is balanced by degradation to the glycerophosphobase to maintain homeostatic levels of membrane lipid (31Baburina I. Jackowski S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9400-9408Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar, 32Barbour S.E. Kapur A. Deal C.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1439: 77-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). These results are consistent with the lack of an effect on the radiolabeling of PtdEtn with [3H]serine with EKI1 overexpression and suggest that the contribution of the decarboxylation of PtdSer to PtdEtn biosynthesis is not down-regulated by the activity of the CDP-ethanolamine pathway. The biochemical characterization of EKI1 reveals the existence of a specific EKI enzyme in mammalian cells. The humanEKI1 cDNA encodes a protein with high specificity for ethanolamine (Figs. 4, A and B). The EKI1 preference for ethanolamine holds true in vivo as well where there is a dramatic stimulation of phosphoethanolamine formation (Fig.6) and an increased PtdEtn radiolabeling (Fig. 5) in contrast to the lack of any significant change in PtdCho biosynthesis (Fig. 7). EKI1 may be identical to the mammalian ethanolamine-specific kinase activities described previously (19Draus E. Niefind J. Vietor K. Havsteen B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1045: 195-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar, 21Weinhold P.A. Rethy V.B. Biochemistry. 1974; 13: 5135-5141Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Weinhold and Rethy (21Weinhold P.A. Rethy V.B. Biochemistry. 1974; 13: 5135-5141Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) partially purified an EKI activity with a molecular size of 36 kDa from rat liver that exhibited no CKI activity. Draus et al. (19Draus E. Niefind J. Vietor K. Havsteen B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1045: 195-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar) also reported the partial purification of a 42-kDa enzyme from human liver that had a relatively high ratio (∼5) of EKI to CKI activities. The EKI1 clone reported in this paper encodes a protein with a predicted molecular size of 49.7 kDa (Fig. 1) and may correspond to the enzymes described above. We also report the existence of a second gene that is highly similar toEKI1, which we call EKI2. EKI1 and EKI2α proteins are 47% identical and 59% similar. EKI1 is 32% identical and 11% similar, whereas EKI2α is 29% identical and 38% similar to the Drosophila Eas protein. Based on the above comparison, it is difficult to definitely state which form is the mammalian homologue of the eas gene. However, there is emerging support for a family of EKI genes that is distinct from the CKI gene family, which encodes dual specificity enzymes. The existence of a mammalian ethanolamine-specific kinase has been a point of discussion due to the characterization of CKI activities that also exhibit significant EKI activity (12Ishidate K. Furusawa K. Nakazawa Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1985; 836: 119-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 13Uchida T. Yamashita S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1043: 281-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 24Porter T.J. Kent C. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 414-422Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The physiological significance of this gene family remains to be established, although the Drosophila bang-sensitive phenotype of the eas mutant points to a critical role for PtdEtn or PtdEtn turnover via the CDP-ethanolamine pathway in neural function. Three cDNAs from rat tissues have been shown to encode CKI activities. Rat CKI1 protein (435 amino acids) and CKI2 protein (453 amino acids) are splice variants and are expressed in the liver (15Uchida T. Yamashita S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 10156-10162Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Uchida T. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1994; 116: 508-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The rat liver CKI biochemically purified by Porter and Kent (24Porter T.J. Kent C. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 414-422Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) exhibits dual reactivity with choline and ethanolamine, has a molecular mass of 47 kDa, and probably corresponds to one of the rat CKI1 or CKI2 isoforms. A third cDNA, CKI3, isolated from the rat kidney is the product of a second gene (14Aoyama C. Nakashima K. Matsui M. Ishidate K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1390: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Rat CKI3 has been expressed in E. coli and demonstrated to encode an enzyme that phosphorylates choline with a 6-fold higher specific activity than ethanolamine (14Aoyama C. Nakashima K. Matsui M. Ishidate K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1390: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Two CKI clones from mouse embryo are homologous with the two rat genes (28Aoyama C. Nakashima K. Ishidate K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1393: 179-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Therefore, there are at least two genes encoding CKI in rat and mouse, although only one human CKI has been characterized thus far (29Hosaka K. Tanaka S. Nikawa J. Yamashita S. FEBS Lett. 1992; 304: 229-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Also, the recently reported yeast gene encoding the EKI protein has about twice the EKI activity compared with CKI (11Kim K. Kim K.H. Storey M.K. Voelker D.R. Carman G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14857-14866Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Until now, only the Drosophila eas gene has been demonstrated to encode a kinase with a high specificity for ethanolamine (20Uchida T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1349: 13-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). EKI plays a role in controlling PtdEtn biosynthesis. The rate of PtdEtn biosynthesis is a function of the availability of exogenous ethanolamine (10McMaster C.R. Choy P.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1124: 13-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), thus implicating a role for EKI. However, this hypothesis has not been tested, and a prevalent view of the CDP-ethanolamine pathway is that the ECT is the regulated step (30Tijburg L.B. Geelen M.J. van Golde L.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 1004: 1-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). The stimulation of PtdEtn formation by EKI1 overexpression was not anticipated, and the data demonstrate that EKI as well as ECT are important metabolic control points. The majority of the ethanolamine radiolabel accumulates as phosphoethanolamine with a 20-fold increase over control, indicating that the ECT remains a key rate-limiting enzyme. The stimulatory effect of EKI1overexpression is evident when ethanolamine supplementation approaches physiological concentrations (9Houweling M. Tijburg L.B. Vaartjes W.J. van Golde L.M. Biochem. J. 1992; 283: 55-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), indicating that the level of phosphoethanolamine is important in pushing the ethanolamine substrate through to PtdEtn. The concentration of cellular phosphoethanolamine is controlled by the availability of ethanolamine and EKI1 protein levels. These data suggest that the regulation of EKI expression and/or activity may contribute to determining PtdEtn biosynthesis by the CDP-ethanolamine pathway in different cell types, and this is consistent with the reduced level of PtdEtn in the Drosophila eas mutant (22Pavlidis P. Ramaswami M. Tanouye M.A. Cell. 1994; 79: 23-33Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Our results indicate a mechanism for PtdEtn homeostasis that is similar to the one that controls cellular PtdCho levels (31Baburina I. Jackowski S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9400-9408Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Increased glycerophosphoethanolamine was associated with stimulated PtdEtn synthesis in response to EKI1 overexpression (Fig. 4). Earlier work from our laboratory indicated that excessive phospholipid synthesis is balanced by degradation to the glycerophosphobase to maintain homeostatic levels of membrane lipid (31Baburina I. Jackowski S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9400-9408Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar, 32Barbour S.E. Kapur A. Deal C.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1439: 77-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). These results are consistent with the lack of an effect on the radiolabeling of PtdEtn with [3H]serine with EKI1 overexpression and suggest that the contribution of the decarboxylation of PtdSer to PtdEtn biosynthesis is not down-regulated by the activity of the CDP-ethanolamine pathway.

Filamin was directly cleaved by granzyme B when target cells were exposed to granzyme B and the lytic protein perforin, but it was also cleaved in a caspase-dependent manner following the ligation of Fas receptors. A similar pattern of filamin cleavage to polypeptides of ∼110 and 95 kDa was observed in Jurkat cells killed by either mechanism. However, filamin cleavage in response to granzyme B was not inhibited by the caspase inhibitor z-Val-Ala-Asp-fluoromethylketone at concentrations that abolished DNA fragmentation. Filamin staining was redistributed from the cell membrane into the cytoplasm of Jurkat cells exposed to granzyme B and perforin and following ligation of Fas receptors, coincident with the morphological changes of apoptosis. Filamin-deficient human melanoma cells were significantly (although not completely) protected from granzyme B-mediated death compared with isogenic filamin-expressing cells, both in clonogenic survival and51Cr release assays, whereas death from multiple other stimuli was not affected by filamin deficiency. Thus, filamin is a functionally important substrate for granzyme B, as its cleavage may account at least partly for caspase-independent cell death mediated by the granzyme.

The first requires a receptor-ligand interaction between a molecule of the TNF family on the surface of the killer cell and its death receptor on the target cell (1Rouvier E. Luciani M.F. Golstein P. J. Exp. Med. 1993; 177: 195-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (808) Google Scholar). The second mechanism operates through contact-dependent release of the granule-bound apoptotic mediators perforin and granzyme B (grB) and is chiefly responsible for eliminating virus-infected cells (2Trapani J.A. Jans D.A. Sutton V.R. Springer Semin. Immunopathol. 1998; 19: 323-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Fas ligation leads to the recruitment of a death-signaling complex at the inner leaflet of the cell membrane (3Boldin M.P. Golcharov T.M. Yoltsev Y.T. Wallach D. Cell. 1996; 85: 813-825Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (2113) Google Scholar). This results in activation of an evolutionarily conserved, caspase-dependent cell death pathway present in virtually every cell. The subsequent cleavage of vital proteins and DNA leads to cell death. The precise mechanism of collaboration between perforin and grB is unknown; it is generally accepted that perforin, a pore-forming protein, enables proapoptotic serine proteases (granzymes) to access their substrates in the target cell, cleavage of which leads to apoptosis (4Browne K.A.

Hengartner H. Zinkernagel R.M. Eur. J. Immunol. 1994; 24: 3068-3072Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Although several different granzymes are capable of inducing cell death in a perforin-dependent manner (9Shi L. Kam C.-M. Powers J.C. Aebersold R. Greenberg A.H. J. Exp. Med. 1992; 176: 1521-1529Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar), the most potent and best characterized is grB, with an ability to cleave proteins after specific Asp residues that enables it to directly activate procaspases, commencing with the cleavage of procaspase-3 (10Yang X. Stennicke H.R. Wang B. Green D.R. Janicke R.U. Srinivasan R. Seth P. Salvesen G.S. Froelich C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34278-34283Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). The congenital absence of grB from the CTL of mice delays target cell apoptosis and is manifested in their reduced ability to provoke nuclear damage including DNA fragmentation (11Heusel J.W. Wesselschmidt R.L. Shresta S. Russell J.H. Ley T.J. Cell. 1994; 76: 977-987Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (753) Google Scholar). Although caspase activation is clearly an important function of grB, we (12Trapani J.A. Jans D.A. Browne K.A. Smyth M.J. Jans P.J. Sutton V.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27934-27938Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar) and others (13Sarin A. Williams M.S. Alexander-Miller M.A. Berzofsky J.A. Zacharchuk C.M. Henkart P.A. Immunity. 1997; 6: 209-215Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar) have shown that grB-mediated apoptosis can occur despite the absence of active caspases. However, the molecular targets responsible for caspase-independent death stimulated by grB have so far proven elusive. The cumulative data from several laboratories have indicated strongly that additional pathways to target cell death arose to overcome the effects of viral anti-apoptotic molecules that delay the suicide of infected cells by blocking caspases (14Trapani J.A. Sutton V.R. Smyth M. Immunol. Today. 1999; 20: 351-356Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). These antiviral pathways probably represent the cumulative response to viral strategies that delay apoptosis, which have coevolved with the immune system (14Trapani J.A. Sutton V.R. Smyth M. Immunol. Today. 1999; 20: 351-356Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Among the many viral apoptosis antagonists identified, prototypes include the cowpox protein CrmA (15Tewari M. Dixit V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3255-3260Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (603) Google Scholar) and baculovirus p35 (16Clem R.J. Fechheimer M. Miller L.K. Science. 1991; 254: 1388-1390Crossref PubMed Scopus (710) Google Scholar), both direct caspase inhibitors. Cell death in the absence of active caspases implies that other proteases can cleave key proteins in the target cell. We have previously reported that grB is rapidly targeted to the nucleus of target cells (17Jans D.A. Jans P Briggs L.J. Sutton V.R. Trapani J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30781-30789Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 18Jans D.A. Briggs L.J. Jans P. Froelich C.J. Parasivam G. Williams E.A. Kumar S. Sutton V.R.

Cell Death Differ. 1998; 5: 488-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), suggesting that grB might induce nuclear collapse when caspases are inactive (21Andrade F. Roy S. Thornberry N. Rosen A. Casciola-Rosen L. Immunity. 1998; 8: 451-460Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar, 22Froelich C.J. Hanna W.L. Poirier G.G. Duriez P.P. D'Amours D. Salvesen G.S. Alnemri E.A. Earnshaw Shah G.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 227: 658-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). GrB can directly cleave some nuclear proteins such as nuclear matrix antigen and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (22Froelich C.J. Hanna W.L. Poirier G.G. Duriez P.P. D'Amours D. Salvesen G.S. Alnemri E.A. Earnshaw Shah G.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 227: 658-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), and granzyme A can activate DNA fragmentation in a caspase-independent manner in cell extracts (23Beresford P.J. Xia Z. Greenberg A.H. Lieberman J. Immunity. 1999; 10: 585-594Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). We also recently demonstrated a marked reduction of nuclear apoptotic changes in response to granzyme B when caspases were inactivated; however, the cells still died through a caspase-independent pathway manifested by cytoplasmic and cell membrane damage (12Trapani J.A. Jans D.A. Browne K.A. Smyth M.J. Jans P.J. Sutton V.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27934-27938Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). These non-nuclear events were a reliable predictor of cell death, as they correlated closely with colony numbers in long-term clonogenic assays (12Trapani J.A. Jans D.A. Browne K.A. Smyth M.J. Jans P.J. Sutton V.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27934-27938Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). In another study in which multiple parameters of CTL-mediated apoptosis were examined, non-nuclear manifestations such as phosphoserine exteriorization, cell membrane blebbing, and changes in mitochondrial membrane potential did not require active caspases, whereas nuclear changes such as chromatin condensation and DNA fragmentation did (24Sarin A. Haddad E.K. Henkart P.A. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 2810-2816Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It was recently reported that grB can induce activation of caspase-activated DNase (CAD) by cleaving its inhibitor (ICAD), thus leading to DNA fragmentation (25Thomas D.A. Du C. Xu M. Wang X. Ley Y.J. Immunity. 2000; 12: 621-632Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Some direct activation of CAD-induced DNA damage persisted despite caspase inhibition; however, the concentrations of grB used was 40–80 times higher than needed to induce grB-mediated apoptosis, so the physiological significance of this pathway remains in question. Moreover, the nucleus is dispensable for CTL-mediated cell death (26Nakajima H. Golstein P. Henkart P.A. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 185: 1905-1910Crossref Scopus (86) Google Scholar), indicating that damage to other parts of the cell are more crucial for determining apoptotic outcome. These results strongly suggested that direct cleavage of non-nuclear substrates by granzymes can lead to caspase-independent cell death. However, no direct granzyme substrates (other than the caspases and ICAD) have been described outside the nucleus. To shed light on unidentified grB substrates, we used yeast two-hybrid screening to identify the cytoskeletal protein filamin (280-kDa actin-binding protein, ABP-280) as a ligand for grB. Herein we demonstrate that filamin can be directly cleaved by grB independently of caspase activation and can also be cleaved following Fas ligation in a caspase-dependent manner. Cells deficient in wild-type filamin are less sensitive to grB-mediated cell death, indicating that filamin is a candidate for the mediation of a caspase-independent non-nuclear pathway to apoptosis in response to grB. The human leukemia cell line Jurkat was maintained in RPMI medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum at 37 °C in air containing 5% CO2. The human melanoma cell line M2, which lacks expression of filamin mRNA, and the isogenic cell line A7, in which expression was re-established by gene transfection, were maintained as above. Both cell lines were a kind gift of Dr. John Hartwig (Harvard Medical School). Human perforin, purified as described, was kindly supplied by Dr. Chris Froelich, Evanston University, Evanston, IL (27Froelich C.J. Turbov J. Hanna W. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 222: 44-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Pneumococcal pneumolysin (PLO) (a gift from Dr. James Paton, University of Adelaide, Australia) was activated in phosphate-buffered saline containing 2-mercapto-ethanol for 30 min. at room temperature. A sublytic dose of the membranolytic agents was defined as producing <10% specific release of 51Cr in a 4-h assay at 37 °C. Neither membranolytic agent was inhibitory for the Asp-ase activity of grB, nor was membrane perforation negatively affected by the caspase inhibitors described below (data not shown). Immunoaffinity purification of human grB from nuclear lysates of YT (human NK leukemia) cells was performed as described (28Trapani J.A. Browne K.A. Dawson M. Smyth M.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 195: 910-920Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The grB was free of grA and Met-ase activities, as well as perforin, as demonstrated by Western blotting and functional assays (28Trapani J.A. Browne K.A. Dawson M. Smyth M.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 195: 910-920Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The oligopeptide caspase inhibitors z-Val-Ala-Asp-fluoromethylketone (z-VAD-fmk) and Phe-Ala-fluoromethylketone (z-FA-fmk) were purchased from Enzyme Systems Products (San Diego, CA), dissolved in Me2SO, and stored in aliquots at −20 °C. Final concentrations of Me2SO did not exceed 0.5% in any of the assays. Polyclonal antisera detecting human ABP-280 were raised in rabbits immunized with a fusion protein consisting of glutathioneS-transferase and the C-terminal 476 amino acids of filamin, which was purified by chromatography on glutathione-agarose. The cDNA encoding human grB was the template in spliced overlap extension polymerase chain reactions to generate a clone lacking the leader sequence and in which the active site Ser183 was mutated to Ala. This fragment was cloned in frame into the EcoRI site of the plasmid vector pAS2-1 (CLONTECH), downstream of sequences encoding the GAL4 DNA binding domain. This “bait” construct was introduced into the yeast strain PJ69-4A and transformants selected by growth on minimal medium deficient in Trp. Yeast containing the bait construct were then cotransfected with cDNA from human peripheral blood lymphocytes stimulated with phytohemagglutinin fused to the transcription activation domain of GAL4 (“prey” construct library) in the plasmid vector pGAD10 (CLONTECH). Clones with putative interactions between bait and prey were selected by growth on medium lacking Trp/Leu/Arg (TLA−) and Trp/Leu/His (TLH−). DNA from clones of interest was used to transform electrocompetent Escherichia coli TOP10F cells, and cDNA inserts of interest were sequenced. 51Cr release (a measure of non-nuclear cell damage) and TUNEL assays were performed as described (12Trapani J.A. Jans D.A. Browne K.A. Smyth M.J. Jans P.J. Sutton V.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27934-27938Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Fas-mediated apoptosis of Jurkat cells was accomplished by incubating the cells in the presence of CH11 anti-Fas antibody (100 ng/ml) for 4 h at 37 °C. Cells undergoing apoptosis in response to anti-Fas antibody or perforin and grB were analyzed by confocal laser scanning microscopy, as described previously in detail (17Jans D.A. Jans P Briggs L.J. Sutton V.R. Trapani J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30781-30789Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 18Jans D.A. Briggs L.J. Jans P. Froelich C.J. Parasivam G.

Chem. 1996; 271: 4127-4133Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). M2 and A7 cells were induced to undergo apoptosis by exposure to medium containing staurosporine for 24 h. Loss of viability was assessed by trypan blue exclusion. A7 and M2 cells in logarithmic growth phase were incubated for 2 h with a sublytic quantity of porin alone and/or with grB (30–120 nm). Cells (5 μl from a stock of 4 × 104 cells/ml) treated with the various apoptotic stimuli were plated out in triplicate in individual wells of a 48-well plate and then incubated at 37 °C for 4–5 days when discrete colonies were counted under an inverted microscope. To identify potential new ligands for grB, we expressed mature human grB as a chimeric protein with the GAL4 DNA binding domain for yeast two-hybrid studies. The same approach was successful in identifying substrates of caspases (apoptotic cysteine proteases) (29Kamada S. Kusano H. Fujita H. Ohtsu M. Koya R. Kuzumaki K. Tsujimoto Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 8532-8537Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). As in the previous study, we engineered an amino acid substitution at the active site residue (Ser to Ala) to favor more stable protease-substrate interactions. Inactive variants of grA have also been used to purify its putative ligands (30Beresford P.J. Kam C.-M. Powers J.C. Lieberman J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 9285-9290Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). The mutated grB was coexpressed in yeast cells with a library of proteins expressed as fusions with the GAL4 transcription activation domain. Serial rounds of screening identified clones in which growth on selective media suggested the presence of bona fide interactors for grB. Sequencing revealed that one clone encoded in frame the 476 amino acids (residues 2172–2647) at the C terminus of the cytoskeletal protein, filamin (ABP-280). The interaction with grB was specific, as the filamin domain did not bind to control proteins p53, CD46, or IFI 16 (data not shown). Filamin is a ubiquitous phosphoprotein located in the peripheral cytoplasm, where its N terminus binds to and promotes orthogonal branching of actin filaments (31Gorlin J.B. Yamin R. Egan S. Stewart M. Stossel T.P. Kwiatkowski M. Hartwig J.H. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 1089-1105Crossref PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar), contributing to membrane stability and the ability to withstand mechanical stress (32Glogauer M. Arora P. Chou D.

The C-terminal 476 amino acids of human filamin contains 16 Asp residues, but none conformed closely to a tetrapeptide consensus sequence for preferred cleavage by grB or caspases (34Fernandes-Alnemri T. Armstrong R.C. Krebs J. Srinivasula S. Wang L. Bullrich F. Fritz L.C. Trapani J.A. Tomaselli K. Litwack G. Alnemri E.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

To establish whether filamin is cleaved during apoptosis induced by grB, or when cells are killed through Fas ligation (the two mechanisms used by cytotoxic lymphocytes), lysates from dying Jurkat cells were probed in Western blots with an antiserum raised against the filamin C terminus (Fig. 1). Cells killed by Fas ligation with anti-Fas IgM demonstrated cleavage of filamin into fragments of ∼110 and 95 kDa, consistent with cleavage at a minimum of two sites. A larger protein possibly corresponding to a partially cleaved species of ∼205 kDa was also seen. As the antiserum reacted poorly with the N terminus of filamin, it is likely that at least one other cleavage product was not identified by Western blotting. Pre-incubation of the Jurkat cells in 20 μmz-VAD-fmk (but not the control inhibitor z-FA-fmk) prior to anti-Fas treatment completely abolished filamin cleavage, indicating that activated caspases are responsible, either directly or indirectly, for filamin proteolysis. When Jurkat cells were exposed to grB with sublytic quantities of perforin, a similar pattern of filamin cleavage was seen; however, the cleavage was not blocked by z-VAD-fmk (Fig. 1). In contrast, this concentration of z-VAD-fmk completely abolished DNA fragmentation as measured in the TUNEL assay and cleavage of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (see Refs. 4Browne K.A. Blink E. Sutton V.R. Froelich C.J. Jans D.A. Trapani J.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 8604-8615Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar and 12Trapani J.A. Jans D.A. Browne K.A. Smyth M.J. Jans P.J. Sutton V.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27934-27938Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, and data not shown). Indeed, grB-mediated cleavage of filamin was not inhibited by pretreatment of the cells with concentrations of z-VAD-fmk up to 50 μm, and filamin cleavage also persisted in MCF-7 human breast cancer cells, which lack caspase-3 (data not shown). Proteolytically inactive (in) grB (with its the active site Ser residue mutated to Ala) expressed in baculovirus-infected insect Sf21 cells was unable to induce filamin cleavage (Fig. 1) or cell death (data not shown), indicating the need for Asp-ase activity for both phenomena. When immunoprecipitated filamin was incubated with purified grB, filamin was cleaved into a number of peptides (Fig. 2), confirming that grB can directly cleave filamin in the absence of other proteases. Several polypeptides (205, 200, and 110 kDa) were of similar size to those observed after intact cells were incubated with perforin and grB. However, the 95-kDa polypeptide seen when intact cells were exposed to perforin/grB was not observed. Collectively, our results suggested that (i) certain sites in filamin are cleaved far more efficiently by grB than are others, and (ii) proteases other than grB may also contribute to filamin processing in the absence of caspases. Filamin is therefore the target of several classes of protease during apoptotic death.Figure 2Cleavage of immunoprecipitated filamin by grB. Western blot (using rabbit anti-filamin antiserum) following digestion at 37 °C with grB (300 nm) for 120 min of filamin immunoprecipitated from a lysate of healthy Jurkat cells and whole Jurkat cell lysates following exposure to sublytic Pfp or in combination with active grB (120 nm) for 120 min. The filled arrowheads indicate filamin fragments generated by direct cleavage of immunoprecipitated filamin and during grB-mediated apoptosis of whole Jurkat cells migrating at approximately the same molecular weight. The open arrowheads indicate filamin fragments generated that are unique to either direct grB cleavage or grB mediated apoptosis of whole cells. The migration of Ig heavy chain (∼50 kDa, detected by the anti-rabbit Ig reagent) is also shown.

Med. 1992; 175: 553-566Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar), linking the plasma membrane and the actin cytoskeleton. Cells were exposed either to anti-Fas antibody for 4 h or to perforin (Pfp) or the bacterial pore-forming toxin, PLO, alone or in combination with grB for 2 h (Fig. 3). Like perforin, PLO can also deliver grB to induce apoptosis in target cells (4Browne K.A. Blink E. Sutton V.R. Froelich C.J. Jans D.A. Trapani J.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 8604-8615Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). In cells that were mock-treated or exposed to Pfp or PLO alone (Fig. 3, left) or to grB alone (data not shown), filamin staining was seen only immediately adjacent to the cell membrane or within pseudopodal membrane projections. In each of these controls, the Jurkat cells remained free from apoptotic changes. However, the filamin staining pattern was markedly altered in cells exposed to both the Pfp/PLO and active grB or to anti-Fas antibody (Fig. 3, right). Filamin became dissociated from the membrane, and was diffusely distributed through the cytoplasm of the dying cells. Filamin continued to be excluded from the nucleus, causing the outlines of apoptotic nuclei to become easily seen. Many of the dying cells also demonstrated the cytoplasmic shrinkage characteristic of apoptotic death. In previous work, we postulated that caspase-independent pathways to apoptosis are likely to be localized in the cytoplasm (12Trapani J.A. Jans D.A. Browne K.A. Smyth M.J. Jans P.J. Sutton V.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27934-27938Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 14Trapani J.A. Sutton V.R. Smyth M. Immunol. Today. 1999; 20: 351-356Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Our demonstration that filamin cleavage is not dependent on caspases raised the possibility that filamin is part of a non-nuclear pathway to cell death mediated by grB, prompting us to evaluate the effect of filamin cleavage on cell survival. The only cells suitable (and available) for such a comparison are a pair of nonclonal isogenic human melanoma cell lines, A7 and M2, that have long served as the best available model of functional filamin deficiency (Refs. 38Cunningham C.C. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 1589-1599Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar and 39Cunningham C.C. GorlinJ B. Kwiatkowski D.J. Hartwig J.H. Janmey P.A. Byers H.R. Stossel T.P. Science. 1992; 255: 325-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar). 2T. Stossel (Harvard University), personal communication. M2 cells fail to synthesize filamin and have no filamin mRNA; however, expression has been re-established in A7 cells by gene-mediated transfection, resulting in appropriate targeting of filamin subjacent to the cell membrane and correction of defects in cell motility and fragility (39Cunningham C.C. GorlinJ B. Kwiatkowski D.J. Hartwig J.H. Janmey P.A. Byers H.R. Stossel T.P. Science. 1992; 255: 325-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar). Significantly greater cell death was observed in the A7 cells compared with the mutant cell line when the cells were exposed to grB, as judged by specific release of 51Cr, the standard assay for CTL-mediated cell death (Fig. 4 A). Experiments 1 and 2 were deliberately carried out with different amounts of PLO. In experiment 1, 51Cr release increased ∼3-fold for M2 cells but 11-fold for A7 cells when the cells were additionally exposed to grB. In experiment 2, where the 51Cr release with lysin alone was intentionally set higher, the increase in response to grB addition was 1.5-fold (30–45%) for M2 and >3-fold (22–70%) for reconstituted A7 cells. To determine whether these differences in Cr release were indicative of long-term protection of M2 cells, both cell lines were treated with grB and lysin for 60 min and then washed and plated out to evaluate their clonogenic potential (Fig. 4 B). A7 filamin-reconstituted cells were significantly and reproducibly more sensitive than filamin-deficient M2 cells to grB-mediated cell death, as indicated by a reduction in colony numbers by ∼40% compared with M2 cells. Our results collectively indicated that filamin is an apoptotic substrate of grB, in which cleavage contributes significantly to the demise of grB-treated cells. Importantly, M2 cells lacking filamin were not resistant to other forms of apoptosis, as indicated by their equivalent sensitivity to staurosporine (Fig. 4 C) when compared with A7 cells. M2 cells were also not protected from γ-irradiation-induced death (data not shown); nor could their resistance to grB be accounted for by reduced susceptibility to perforin/PLO lysis or to intrinsic differences in clonogenic capacity (data not shown). The only death stimulus we have found to which M2 cells were resistant was grB, in the context of lysin-mediated delivery. Unfortunately, A7 and M2 cells are resistant to Fas- and TNF-mediated apoptosis due to poor receptor expression, so it was not possible to evaluate the effects of filamin deficiency on receptor-mediated cell death. We also found no evidence of defective grB trafficking in filamin-deficient cells; the kinetics of uptake of fluoresceinated grB into M2 and A7 cells was indistinguishable, as measured by confocal microscopy and image analysis (see Ref. 20Trapani J.A. Jans P. Smyth M.J. Froelich C.J. Williams E.A. Sutton V.R. Jans D. Cell Death Differ. 1998; 5: 488-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar; data not shown). We thus concluded that filamin deficiency can specifically confer partial protection from grB-mediated apoptotic death. Filamin is the first non-nuclear substrate of grB identified whose direct cleavage influences cell survival. Although filamin is a substrate for caspases, grB can also cleave filamin directly when caspases are inactivated. Under most circumstances, grB is a powerful apoptotic mediator as it can efficiently activate the caspase cascade, commencing with the cleavage of procaspase-3 (10Yang X. Stennicke H.R. Wang B. Green D.R. Janicke R.U. Srinivasan R. Seth P. Salvesen G.S. Froelich C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34278-34283Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). However, cell death through grB still occurs when caspases are inactivated by caspase inhibitors such as p35 or by z-VAD-fmk. Interestingly, commitment to death under these circumstances is accompanied by minimal initial nuclear damage, consistent with the fact that nuclear events are dispensable for CTL-mediated cell death (26Nakajima H. Golstein P. Henkart P.A. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 185: 1905-1910Crossref Scopus (86) Google Scholar). In contrast, non-nuclear manifestations of cell death persist despite caspase inactivation; and despite their normal nuclear morphology early in apoptosis, the cells do not survive in clonogenic assays, indicating they are already destined to die (12Trapani J.A. Jans D.A. Browne K.A. Smyth M.J. Jans P.J. Sutton V.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27934-27938Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). We have therefore favored the likelihood that cytoplasmic, not nuclear, substrates are crucial in delivering the lethal hit from grB. Our present findings that cleavage of a cytoplasmic cytoskeletal element, filamin, can influence cell survival in response to grB is consistent with this hypothesis. Although the mechanism by which filamin deficiency protects cells against grB is not yet understood at the molecular level, there are several other instances of the cytoskeleton controlling apoptotic outcome. For example, the light chain of the dynein motor complex sequesters the proapoptotic BH3-only Bcl-2 family member, Bim, until an apoptotic stimulus triggers Bim release, thus permitting it to access and disrupt the integrity of the mitochondrial membrane (40Puthalakath H. Huang D.C. O'Reilly L.A. King S.M. Strasser A. Mol Cell. 1999; 3: 287-296Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (906) Google Scholar). By analogy, filamin might sequester a key grB substrate or even grB itself by direct binding; however, the prediction of this model is that the levels of a free grB should increase in M2 cells, thereby increasing their susceptibility to apoptosis. This prediction is clearly at odds with our findings, which, if anything, predict the opposite scenario, that binding of grB to filamin might potentiate its ability to bind and cleave other proapoptotic substrates. An alternative possibility is that toxic cleavage products may be generated from filamin by grB and possibly the caspases. This mechanism would be reminiscent of the cleavage of another actin-binding protein, gelsolin, by caspases (41Kothakota S. Azuma T. Reinhard C. Klippel A. Tang J. Chu K. McGarry T.J. Kirschner M.W. Koths K. Kwiatkowski D.J. Williams L.T. Science. 1997; 278: 294-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (1042) Google Scholar). Upon cleavage by caspase-3, it has been proposed that a 41-kDa N-terminal fragment of gelsolin induces cleavage of F-actin filaments, leading to cytoskeletal collapse (42Kwiatkowski D.J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 103-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). However, this mechanism remains controversial, as gelsolin overexpression did not result in increased sensitivity of lymphocytes to apoptotic stimuli (43Posey S.C. Martelli M.P. Azuma T. Kwiatkowski D.J. Bierer B.E. Blood. 2000; 95: 3483-3488Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To date, there is no evidence that filamin cleavage products are toxic, but if this were the case one would expect M2 cells to also be resistant to receptor-mediated killing, as Fas ligation also resulted in filamin cleavage in Jurkat cells (Fig. 1). Unfortunately, M2 and A7 cells are resistant to Fas- and TNF-mediated cell death, making it impossible to test this prediction. We are currently mapping filamin cleavage sites and testing whether the cleavage products are toxic. The findings presented in this paper represent a considerable step forward in our understanding of the impressive redundancy in proapoptotic mechanisms within cytolytic granules. We have defined a novel pathway used by grB to overcome potential inhibition of caspase-mediated cell death pathways, involving the proteolysis of a cytoskeletal protein, filamin, the cleavage of which influences cell survival. The ability of grB to directly induce cell death in the cytoplasm without invoking caspase-mediated nuclear damage represents an evolutionary adaptation of the immune system to counter the ability of viruses to block the intrinsic cell suicide pathway.

These hypertrophic pathways include those regulated by the Ras superfamily of small GTPases and a separate calcineurin-regulated pathway that culminates in the activation of the transcription factor NFAT3. In this report, we demonstrate a functional interaction between Ras-regulated and calcineurin-regulated pathways. In particular, expression in neonatal myocytes of a constitutively active form of Ras (V12ras), but not activating mutants of Rac1, RhoA, or Cdc42, results in an increase in NFAT activity.

Initially this increase in myocyte size leads to an increase in contractile power allowing the heart to meet the increased demands induced by these precipitating genetic or acquired conditions. However, with time this initially beneficial response turns maladaptive. Indeed, the presence of cardiac hypertrophy carries with it an approximate 2-fold increase in overall cardiovascular mortality (1Levy D. Garrison R.J. Savage D.D. Kannel W.B. Castelli W.P. N. Engl. J. Med. 1990; 322: 1561-1566Crossref PubMed Scopus (4853) Google Scholar). Laboratory analysis of cardiac hypertrophy has often involved the use of primary cultures of neonatal rat cardiac myocytes. Studies over the last decade have demonstrated that these cells undergo an increase in size following ligand stimulation with agents such as endothelin-1, angiotensin II, or phenylephrine (2Sugden P.H. Clerk A. J. Mol. Med. 1998; 76: 725-746Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar, 3Hunter J.J. Chien K.R. N. Engl. J. Med. 1999; 341: 1276-1283Crossref PubMed Scopus (740) Google Scholar). In cultured ventricular myocytes, treatment with hypertrophic stimuli also increases expression of a host of immediate early genes, alters sarcomeric protein expression, and reactivates expression of atrial natriuretic factor (ANF)1 and the related B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP). Analysis of the signaling pathways activated in these in vitro models has yielded considerable insight into the process of hypertrophy. Early studies demonstrated a role for Ras proteins in the hypertrophic process. In particular, microinjection of constitutively active forms of Ras recapitulated the hypertrophic program with an increase in cell size and the enhanced expression of hypertrophic markers such as ANF (4Thorburn A.

In addition, stimulation with hypertrophic agents such as phenylephrine leads to an increase in Ras-GTP levels (5Chiloeches A. Paterson H.F. Marais R. Clerk A. Marshall C.J. Sugden P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19762-19770Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). These in vitro studies have been complemented within vivo experiments that demonstrated increased left ventricular mass and increased ANF expression in cardiac-targeted transgenics expressing a constitutively active ras gene product (6Hunter J.J.

Recently, other members of the Ras superfamily of small GTPases have been implicated in hypertrophic signaling. Studies with activating and dominant negative mutants of RhoA have demonstrated a role for this GTPase in certain aspects of ligand-stimulated myofibrillogenesis and hypertrophic gene expression (7Sah V.P.

Res. 1999; 84: 458-466Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Similarly, expression of activated forms of the related small GTPase Rac1 also leads to a hypertrophic response, whereas expression of dominant negative Rac1 blocks phenylephrine-stimulated hypertrophy (11Aikawa R.

Recently, both activated forms of RhoA and Rac1 have been expressed in a cardiac-targeted fashion in transgenic mice. Mice that overexpress constitutively active RhoA appear to have an increase in atrial but not ventricular mass and significant atrial-ventricular conduction abnormalities (13Sah V.P. Minamisawa S. Tam S.P. Wu T.H. Dorn G.W. Ross Jr., J. Chien K.R. Brown J.H. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 103: 1627-1634Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). These conduction abnormalities may relate more to the ability of RhoA to regulate ion channel activity then to any direct effect of the GTPase on cardiac myocyte growth (14Cachero T.G. Morielli A.D. Peralta E.G. Cell. 1998; 93: 1077-1085Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Cardiac expression of constitutively active forms of Rac1 results in a pattern of ventricular dilatation in some animals whereas left ventricular hypertrophy is evident in other animals (15Sussman M.A. Welch S. Walker A. Klevitsky R. Hewett T.E. Price R.L. Schaefer E. Yager K. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 105: 875-886Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Recently, intense interest has focused on another pathway that appears to contribute to the hypertrophic response. Analysis of the BNP promoter demonstrated a crucial role for NFAT3 in the transcriptional activation of this promoter following hypertrophic stimulation (16Molkentin J.D. Lu J.R. Antos C.L. Markham B. Richardson J. Robbins J. Grant S.R. Olson E.N. Cell. 1998; 93: 215-228Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2204) Google Scholar). NFAT3 is one of four known NFAT family members. Expression of NFAT3 occurs in the heart and in a number of other tissues, whereas expression of the other NFAT family members appears to be restricted to immune cells or skeletal muscle (17Rao A. Luo C. Hogan P.G. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1997; 15: 707-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (2221) Google Scholar). Elegant studies in immune cells have demonstrated that T cell activation results in an increase in intracellular calcium leading to the subsequent activation of the cytoplasmic phosphatase calcineurin. Once activated, calcineurin dephosphorylates NFAT resulting in nuclear translocation of NFAT. Once in the nucleus, NFAT binds DNA in a sequence-specific fashion to activate expression of a host of gene products involved in T cell activation. The best studied example of NFAT-mediated gene expression involves interleukin-2 (IL-2) production following T cell activation. The importance of the pathway described above is evident by the discovery that the immunosuppressant cyclosporin A functions by inhibiting calcineurin and, hence, subsequent NFAT activation and T cell responsiveness. The relevance of this pathway to cardiac hypertrophy is underscored by the observation that cardiac-targeted transgenic animals expressing constitutively activated forms of either calcineurin or NFAT3 produced ventricular hypertrophy (16Molkentin J.D.

Given the expanding list of pathways implicated in the hypertrophic signaling cascade, it seems possible that some degree of crosstalk or interactions might exist between these seemingly diverse members. In this report, we have specifically attempted to understand whether there is any potential interaction between hypertrophic pathways regulated by the various small GTPases and the more recently described NFAT-dependent pathway. Neonatal ventricular myocytes were prepared from hearts of 2-day-old Harlan Sprague-Dawley rats. Excised hearts were treated overnight with cold trypsin digestion in calcium and magnesium free Hepes-buffered salt solution followed by collagenase digestion in Leibovitz's L-15 media (Worthington Biochemical, NJ). Myocytes were subsequently isolated by 40 trituration strokes, and debris was removed by passage through a 70-μm filter. The cells were pelleted by low speed centrifugation and subject to two 30-min rounds of preplating to allow for the purification of myocytes from contaminating fibroblasts. Previous immunohistochemical staining has verified that this procedure results in a population of cells that is over 90% myocytes (12Pracyk J.B. Tanaka K. Hegland D.D. Kim K.S. Sethi R. Rovira I.I.

Cells were plated on laminin-coated 6-well dishes at a density of 3 × 105 cells/cm2in plating media that consisted of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/Ham's F-12 (1:1, v/v) with 15 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 10 mg/liter insulin, 5.5 mg/liter transferrin, 5 μg/liter selenium, 2 mg/liter ethanolamine, 10,000 units/ml penicillin, and 10,000 μg/ml streptomycin supplemented with 5% horse serum (Life Technologies, MD). Cells were transfected 24 h after plating. Eighteen hours after transfection, the medium was changed to serum free plating medium, and phenylephrine (Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, MO), cyclosporin A (Sigma), or PD98059 (Calbiochem, La Jolla, CA) was added for the remaining 48 h prior to harvest. Plasmids encoding activated forms of Ras (V12ras), Rac1 (V12rac), RhoA (V14rhoA), Cdc42H (V12cdc42H), c-Raf (Raf BXB), or MEK1 (MEK-E) or plasmids encoding dominant negative forms of Ras (N17ras), Rac1 (N17rac), RhoA (N19RhoA), c-Raf (Raf301), and ERK2 (ERK185) have been described previously (22Coso O.A.

The Ras effector mutant (V12/C40), which exclusively activates phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) but not c-Raf or other Ras effector molecules, has also been described previously (25Rodriquez-Viciana P.

For analysis of NFAT activity, a luciferase reporter containing three tandem repeats of a 30-bp fragment of the IL-2 promoter was routinely used. To confirm these results, an authentic NFAT3 reporter was constructed containing two tandem copies of the sequence 5′-CGCGTCTATCCTTTTGTTTTCCATCCTG-3′ derived from the BNP promoter and previously demonstrated to bind NFAT3 (16Molkentin J.D.

A fusion protein encoding green fluorescence protein (GFP) and NFAT3 (a gift of J. Molkentin) was constructed by ligation of full-length NFAT3 into pEGFP-C1 (CLONTECH). The construct was confirmed by nucleotide sequencing. For luciferase assays, except where indicated, myocytes were transfected using 4 μg of the indicated small GTPase or corresponding empty vector and 1 μg of the indicated NFAT reporter construct and 0.1 μg of the pPRL-TK renilla transfection control plasmid. Cells were harvested 66 h after transfection, and the ratio of luciferase to renilla activity was measured using the dual luciferase assay in accordance with the manufacturer's recommendation (Promega, WI). Where indicated, cells were treated with either phenylephrine, cyclosporin A, wortmannin, or the MEK1 inhibitor PD98059 (20 μm). All experiments were performed at least three times, and one representative experiment performed in triplicate is routinely shown. Statistical significance (*) is determined by a pairedt test with a value of p < 0.05 considered significant. Following transfection with GFP-NFAT3 fusion protein construct (2.5 μg) and a construct encoding the indicated small GTPase, dominant negative c-Raf, ERK2, or empty vector control (2.5 μg), cells were visualized by a Nikon TE300 fluorescence microscope. For quantification purposes, cells were considered positive if the nuclear fluorescence was the sole or predominant localization of GFP-NFAT3. Values represent the mean percentage ± S.D. of cells demonstrating nuclear predominant fluorescence obtained from three wells of a single representative experiment (∼200 cells). For analysis of c-Jun N-terminal (JNK) kinase activity, myocytes were transiently transfected with mammalian expression vectors encoding an epitope-tagged form of JNK (HA-JNK) with or without the indicated small GTPase. Twenty-four hours after transfection, cells were washed three times and maintained in serum-free medium for an additional 12 h. Unstimulated cells or cells stimulated for 30 min with phenylephrine (50 μm) were subsequently harvested in lysis buffer as described previously (26Minden A. Lin A. McMahon M. Lange-Carter C. Derijard B.,. Davis R.G. Johnson G.L. Karin M. Science. 1994; 266: 1719-1723Crossref PubMed Scopus (1011) Google Scholar). Transfected HA-JNK was immunoprecipitated from 30 μg of protein lysate using an anti-HA mouse monoclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA). The activity of the immune complex was assayed using 2 μg of GST-ATF-2 as a substrate (26Minden A. Lin A. McMahon M. Lange-Carter C. Derijard B.,. Davis R.G. Johnson G.L. Karin M. Science. 1994; 266: 1719-1723Crossref PubMed Scopus (1011) Google Scholar). The reactions were terminated with SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis sample buffer, and samples were then subjected to electrophoresis on 12% polyacrylamide gels followed by autoradiography. For assessment of calcineurin activity, cells were infected with a recombinant adenovirus encoding N17ras (Ad.N17ras) or a control adenovirus lacking a transgene (Ad.dl312). Both viruses have been described previously (27Kim K.S. Takeda K. Sethi R. Pracyk J.B. Tanaka K. Zhou Y.F., Yu, Z.X. Ferrans V.J. Bruder J.T. Kovesdi I. Irani K. Goldschmidt-Clermont P. Finkel T. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 1821-1826Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar), and the infection was performed at a multiplicity of infection of 25. Twelve hours after infection, the viral particles were removed and the media was replaced with serum free media with or without phenylephrine. Forty eight hours later, cardiomyocytes were harvested in lysis buffer (50 mmTris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm CaCl2) supplemented with protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), and clarified by centrifugation. The Quantizyme assay system AK-804 was performed by using 1 μg of protein lysate according to the manufacturer's procedure (BIOMOL, Plymouth Meeting, PA). Calcineurin phosphatase activity was measured spectrophotometrically by detecting free-phosphate released from the calcineurin-specific RII phosphopeptide as described previously (28Taigen T. De Windt L.J. Lim H.W. Molkentin J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 1196-1201Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). Results are from one of three similar experiments each performed in triplicate. To understand the relationship between the Ras family of GTPases and the regulation of NFAT3, we transfected cultures of neonatal rat myocytes with plasmids encoding constitutively active forms of Ras, Rac1, RhoA, and Cdc42 along with an NFAT-dependent reporter plasmid. As demonstrated in Fig.1 A, expression of an activatedras gene (V12ras) but not similar forms of Rac1, Cdc42, or RhoA resulted in an increase in NFAT activity. In six separate experiments, each performed in triplicate, expression of V12ras resulted in anywhere from a 2- to 6-fold increase in NFAT activity. This degree of increased NFAT activation seen with V12ras was comparable to what we observed with phenylephrine stimulation (see Fig.3). Because separately, activated forms of Rac1 and RhoA were incapable of activating NFAT, we next tested whether these small GTPases could synergize with V12ras. As seen in Fig. 1 B, addition of activated forms of RhoA or Rac1 to V12ras tended to inhibit activation rather than potentiate V12ras-stimulated reporter gene activity. The basis for this inhibition is unknown but may reflect competition for shared downstream molecules.Figure 3Phenylephrine-stimulated NFAT activity is inhibited by N17ras expression. Myocytes were transfected with dominant negative forms of Ras or Rac1 and stimulated with phenylephrine (10 μm). Levels of NFAT activity were determined under basal (open bars) and ligand-stimulated (shaded bars) conditions using the dual luciferase assay.B, effects of N17rac on JNK activity. Myocytes were transfected with an epitope-tagged JNK construct along with either a plasmid encoding N17rac or empty vector DNA. Kinase activity was measured in an immune complex assay under basal and phenylephrine (PE)-stimulated conditions.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The NFAT reporter used in Fig. 1 (A and B) represents a sequence derived initially from the promoter of IL-2, a known NFAT-responsive gene in T cells. The predominant form of NFAT in cardiac myocytes is NFAT3. Recent evidence suggests that BNP expression in myocytes is regulated by NFAT3, and an authentic consensus binding site has been found in the BNP promoter (16Molkentin J.D. Lu J.R. Antos C.L. Markham B. Richardson J. Robbins J. Grant S.R. Olson E.N. Cell. 1998; 93: 215-228Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2204) Google Scholar). To confirm the effects of V12ras using an authentic NFAT3 binding site, we constructed a reporter plasmid containing two tandem NFAT3 sites, derived from the BNP promoter, upstream of luciferase. As demonstrated in Fig.1 C, expression of V12ras stimulated NFAT activity using this reporter. Again activation of NFAT activity was specific for Ras and not shared by other small GTPases such as V12rac. Using this reporter, the level of activation observed with V12ras expression, as well as with phenylephrine stimulation (data not shown), tended to be slightly less robust then with the standard NFAT reporter. These differences may relate to the spacing of the tandem NFAT3 sites or due to the fact that NFAT proteins predominantly bind in a cooperative fashion with other transcription factors (17Rao A. Luo C. Hogan P.G. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1997; 15: 707-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (2221) Google Scholar). Activation of NFAT involves the dephosphorylation of the transcription factor by calcineurin, resulting in its translocation from the cytosol to the nucleus. To confirm the effects of V12ras on NFAT activity in neonatal myocytes, we constructed a GFP-NFAT3 fusion construct. Transfection of this construct into myocytes revealed that, under basal conditions, the fusion protein was either distributed in the cytosol with nuclear exclusion of GFP or a combination of both cytosol and nucleus (Fig. 2, A andB). A nuclear-predominant fluorescence was routinely observed in less than 5% of control cells. As demonstrated in Fig.2 C, expression of V12ras resulted in a shift in GFP-NFAT3 localization with a significant number of cells now displaying nuclear predominant fluorescence. Quantification of these observations confirmed that activated Ras expression, but not activated forms of other small GTPases, resulted in a 5- to 10-fold increase in the number of cells expressing a nuclear predominant form of the GFP-NFAT3 fusion protein (Fig. 2 D). We next sought to understand the role of Ras proteins in physiological activation of NFAT in cardiac myocytes. To begin to address this, we transfected myocytes with dominant negative forms of either Ras, Rac1, or RhoA proteins and stimulated cells with phenylephrine. As previously noted, phenylephrine led to an ∼3-fold increase in NFAT activity (Fig. 3). Expression of N17rac had no effect on phenylephrine-stimulated NFAT activity. The functional effects of N17rac expression in cardiac myocytes was confirmed by analyzing phenylephrine-stimulated c-jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) activity. As seen in Fig. 3 B, N17rac expression inhibited the activation of JNK by phenylephrine under conditions in which it had no effect on phenylephrine-stimulated NFAT activity. Similarly, in a separate series of three experiments performed in triplicate, expression of N19RhoA did not effect phenylephrine-stimulated NFAT activity (control = 2.2 ± 0.8-fold and N19RhoA = 2.8 ± 1.2-fold, p = 0.57). In contrast, expression of N17ras reduced phenylephrine-stimulated NFAT reporter activity (Fig. 3 A). Similarly, treatment of cells with phenylephrine led to an increased nuclear localization of the GFP-NFAT3 fusion protein (Fig. 4 A). The ability of phenylephrine to stimulate this nuclear translocation was significantly inhibited by N17ras expression (Fig.4 B). We next sought to analyze at what level Ras intersects with the NFAT3 pathway. To understand whether this occurs upstream or downstream of calcineurin, we transfected myocytes with V12ras and subsequently treated cells with the calcineurin inhibitor cyclosporin A. As demonstrated in Fig. 5 A, the addition of cyclosporin A inhibited in a concentration-dependent fashion the ability of V12ras to stimulate NFAT activity. Similarly, treatment of cells with cyclosporin A blocked V12ras-stimulated NFAT3 nuclear localization (Fig.5 B). These results argue that the effects of Ras are most likely upstream of calcineurin activation. To further pursue this notion, we infected cells with a recombinant adenovirus encoding N17ras or with a control adenovirus lacking a transgene. As demonstrated in Fig. 6, in control infected cells stimulation of myocytes with phenylephrine led to an increase in calcineurin activity consistent with previous results (28Taigen T. De Windt L.J. Lim H.W. Molkentin J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 1196-1201Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). In cells expressing N17ras, although basal calcineurin activity was not significantly effected, the rise in calcineurin activity seen following ligand stimulation was inhibited.Figure 6Expression of N17ras blocks phenylephrine-stimulated calcineurin activity. Myocytes were infected with a control adenovirus (−) or with a recombinant adenovirus encoding N17ras (Ad.N17ras). Where indicated, cells were stimulated with phenylephrine (PE; 10 μm) for 48 h prior to lysis. Calcineurin activity in the lysate was measured by phosphate release using a calcineurin specific phosphopeptide as substrate.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Ras proteins activate a number of downstream effector pathways. Perhaps the best characterized pathway involves the activation of MAPK that proceeds through c-Raf and MEK1 activation (29Shields J.M. Pruitt K. McFall A. Shaub A. Der C.J. Trends Cell Biol. 2000; 10: 147-154Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (689) Google Scholar). To test whether this pathway was involved in NFAT activation in cardiac myocytes, we treated cells with the specific MEK1 inhibitor PD98059. As seen in Fig.7 A, treatment of cells with this compound inhibited NFAT transcriptional activity induced by either V12ras expression or by phenylephrine stimulation. Similarly, PD98059 treatment inhibited nuclear translocation of GFP-NFAT3 induced by either V12ras expression or phenylephrine stimulation (Fig.7 B). Consistent with the results obtained by pharmacological inhibition, as demonstrated in Fig. 8, expression of a dominant negative form of c-Raf or ERK2 prevented phenylephrine-stimulated NFAT3 nuclear localization. To further address whether the activation of the MAPK pathway was sufficient to activate NFAT, we expressed constitutively activated forms of c-Raf or MEK1. As seen in Fig. 9, these constructs activated NFAT activity to a similar degree as V12ras. In addition, the ability of both the activated c-Raf and MEK1 constructs to stimulate NFAT activity was inhibited by cyclosporin treatment.Figure 9Expression of an activated form of c-Raf (Raf-BXB) or MEK1 (MEK-E) activates NFAT in a calcineurin-dependent fashion. The level of NFAT transcriptional activity was determined in myocytes transfected either with empty vector or with activated forms of c-Raf or MEK1 and then treated with or without cyclosporin (CSA;10 ng/ml).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Although these results suggest a significant role for a pathway involving Ras-Raf-MEK1 and MAPK, it does not exclude a role for other Ras-regulated pathways. One downstream effector of Ras implicated in cardiac hypertrophy is PI3K (30Shioi T. Kang P.M. Douglas P.S. Hampe J. Yballe C.M. Lawitts J. Cantley L.C. Izumo S. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2537-2548Crossref PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar). To ascertain whether this Ras-regulated pathway participated in V12ras-stimulated NFAT activation, we asked whether the ability of V12ras to stimulate NFAT activity could be inhibited by the PI3K inhibitor wortmannin. As demonstrated in Fig. 10 A, treatment of V12ras-expressing cells with wortmannin produced a modest but concentration-dependent inhibition of NFAT activity. Similarly, expression of the Ras effector mutant V12/C40 capable of specifically activating PI3K but not other Ras targets such as c-Raf produced a small increase in NFAT activity (Fig. 10 B). These results suggest that, although activation of Raf-MEK1-MAPK-dependent pathways is necessary and sufficient for NFAT activation in cardiac myocytes, other Ras effector pathways may also participate. Our results demonstrate an essential role for Ras proteins in the regulation of NFAT3 activity in cardiac myocytes. In particular, we demonstrate that activated Ras stimulates NFAT activity and nuclear translocation and a dominant negative form of Ras blocks phenylephrine-stimulated NFAT activation. The ability of V12ras or phenylephrine to stimulate NFAT activity is significantly inhibited by treatment with the pharmacological MEK1 inhibitor PD98059, suggesting that activation of MAPK is necessary for NFAT activation. This is also supported by the inhibition of phenylephrine-stimulated NFAT3 translocation seen with expression of a dominant negative form of c-Raf and ERK2. Our results also place the Ras/Raf/MEK1/MAPK pathway upstream of calcineurin, because cyclosporin blocks the ability of constitutively active mutants in this pathway to activate NFAT. In addition, expression of N17ras inhibits the rise in calcineurin activity seen following phenylephrine stimulation. Previous studies in immune cells has also implicated Ras proteins in the activation of NFAT. Expression of V12ras can mimic in part T cell receptor activation, although expression of activated Ras is not by itself sufficient to activate NFAT (31Cantrell D. Pastor M.I. Woodrow M. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1994; 365: 73-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). Coexpression of an activated form of calcineurin or treatment with calcium ionophores appears however to synergize with a Ras signal to produce full NFAT activation (31Cantrell D. Pastor M.I. Woodrow M. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1994; 365: 73-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar, 32Woodrow M.A. Rayter S. Downward J. Cantrell D.A. J. Immunol. 1993; 150: 3853-3861PubMed Google Scholar, 33Genot E. Cleverley S. Henning S. Cantrell D. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3923-3933Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 34Woodrow M. Clipstone N.A. Cantrell D. J. Exp. Med. 1993; 178: 1517-1522Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). In both T cells and other immune cells a role for Rac proteins has also been demonstrated with experiments demonstrating that a dominant negative form of Rac can inhibit NFAT activation (35Turner H. Cantrell D.A. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 185: 43-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 36Turner H. Gomez M. McKenzie E. Kirchem A. Lennard A. Cantrell D.A. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 188: 527-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The activation of NFAT3 in cardiac myocytes therefore appears to differ in significant fashion from immune cells. In particular, our studies suggest that V12ras is sufficient alone to activate NFAT3. In addition, we observed no effects of N17rac or other small GTPases on phenylephrine-stimulated NFAT activity. The level of activation seen with V12ras was comparable to what was observed with phenylephrine stimulation, and thus there is no evidence that an additional calcium-dependent stimulus was needed. These latter differences may relate to the large differences in calcium handling between immune cell and contractile cardiac myocytes. The elucidation of multiple pathways that contribute to cardiac hypertrophy represent an important advance in our understanding of this condition. The development of therapeutic options to treat hypertrophy will undoubtedly be dependent on a deeper understanding of the inter-relations and hierarchy of the various pathways. The results presented here place Ras and subsequent MAPK activation upstream of calcineurin and NFAT activation in cardiac myocytes. This underscores a central role for Ras in the development of hypertrophy. Our preliminary evidence suggests that an MAPK-dependent pathway represents the major pathway through which Ras proteins activate NFAT. Nonetheless, other Ras effectors may also contribute as we do observe a small but noticeable contribution from PI3K-dependent pathways in the activation of NFAT (Fig. 10). Although this study increases our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying cardiac hypertrophy, many questions remain. For instance, it is unclear to what degree the activation of NFAT by Ras proteins contributes to the ability of Ras proteins to induce hypertrophy in vivo (6Hunter J.J. Tanaka N. Rockman H.A. Ross Jr., J. Chien K.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23173-23178Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). Similarly, the mechanism through which MAPK activation leads to NFAT activation is unknown. Recent evidence suggests that a Raf/MEK1/MAPK-dependent pathway is involved in the regulation of intracellular calcium transients in cardiac myocytes (37Ho P.D. Zechner D.K. He H. Dillmann W.H. Glembotski C.C. McDonough P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21730-21735Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). As such, these results are consistent with what is described here and suggest MAPK is upstream of calcineurin and may regulate the phosphatase by altering intracellular calcium levels. The ability of Rac proteins to produce hypertrophy in vitro and in vivo (11Aikawa R. Komuro I. Yamazaki T. Zou Y. Kudoh S. Zhu W. Kadowaki T. Yazaki Y. Circ.

The activation of c-jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and the p38 MAPK family has recently been implicated in cardiac hypertrophy (38McDonough P.M. Hanford D.S. Sprenkle A.B. Mellon N.R. Glembotski C.C. J.

Clin. Invest. 1999; 104: 391-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). In myocytes and other cell types, these kinases are regulated by Rac and related small GTPases (46van Aelst L. D'Souza-Schorey C. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2295-2322Crossref PubMed Scopus (2096) Google Scholar). The activity of Rac, RhoA, and Cdc42 is also regulated in part by Ras proteins suggesting that Ras might be an important regulator of a number of critical and distinct pathways leading to hypertrophy. Similarly, given the existence of these separate pathways, it would seem reasonable that inhibition of calcineurin activity may not abolish hypertrophy induced by all stimuli. This is apparently supported by data suggesting that cyclosporin A is ineffective in preventing pressure-overload-induced hypertrophy in rats (20Zhang W. Kowal R.C. Rusnak F. Sikkink R.A. Olson E.N.

In summary, we demonstrate the requirement for Ras activity and subsequent MAPK activation in the regulation of NFAT3 in cardiac myocytes. These results are distinct from what is observed in the immune activation of NFAT, but in both cells, there appears to be at least a partial requirement for Ras proteins. We cannot demonstrate a role for other small GTPases in NFAT activation in myocytes, although previous evidence suggests that these proteins can participate in hypertrophic signaling. These results further our understanding of the hypertrophic process and suggest a critical and expanded role of Ras proteins in this response. We thank S. Gutkind, J. Molkentin, J. Downward, and J.

Primarily an extracellular pathogen, S. aureus colonizes the host by adhering to components of the extracellular matrix.

Fg is a 340-kDa glycoprotein that is present at a concentration of ∼9 μm in the blood. It is composed of six polypeptide chains (two Aα-, two Bβ-, and two γ-chains) that are arranged in a symmetrical dimeric structure. A key player in hemostasis, Fg mediates platelet adherence and aggregation at sites of injury. In addition, it is cleaved by thrombin to form fibrin, which is the major component of blood clots. Fg is also one of the main proteins deposited on implanted biomaterials. Clumping factor A (ClfA) was the first Fg-binding MSCRAMM of S. aureus to be identified and characterized in detail (see Fig. 1) (6McDevitt D. François P. Vaudaux P. Foster T.J. Mol.

ClfA has structural features that are common to many other surface proteins expressed by Gram-positive bacteria. At the N terminus is a signal sequence for Sec-dependent secretion (see Fig. 1, S), whereas the C terminus contains an LPXTG motif, a hydrophobic membrane-spanning region (M), and positively charged amino acid residues. The LPXTG motif is the target of a transpeptidase (called “sortase”) that cleaves the motif between the threonine and glycine residues and anchors the protein to the peptidoglycan cell wall (12Schneewind O. Fowler A. Faull K.F. Science. 1995; 268: 103-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar,13Mazmanian S.K. Liu G. Ton-That H. Schneewind O. Science. 1999; 285: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (795) Google Scholar). The Fg-binding activity of ClfA has been localized to the N-terminal A region of this protein (see Fig. 1) (14McDevitt D. François P. Vaudaux P. Foster T.J. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 16: 895-907Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). The binding site in Fg for ClfA has been localized to the C-terminal end of the γ-chain, a site that is also recognized by the platelet integrin αIIbβ3 (15Hawiger J. Timmons S. Strong D.D.

Indeed, recombinant ClfA is a potent inhibitor of both Fg-mediated platelet aggregation and adherence of platelets to immobilized Fg in vitro (17McDevitt D. Nanavaty T. House-Pompeo K. Bell E. Turner N. McIntire L. Foster T.J. Höök M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 247: 416-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). As for αIIbβ3, the binding of ClfA to Fg is regulated by divalent cations, including Ca2+ and Mn2+ (20O'Connell D.P. Nanavaty T. McDevitt D. Gurusiddappa S. Höök M. Foster T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6821-6829Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 21Kirchhofer D. Gailit J. Ruoslahti E. Grzesiak J. Pierschbacher M.D. J. Biol.

Both of these cations inhibit ClfA-mediated clumping of S. aureus in the presence of soluble Fg and the interaction of recombinant ClfA with a synthetic fluorescein-labeled C-terminal γ-chain peptide (20O'Connell D.P. Nanavaty T. McDevitt D. Gurusiddappa S. Höök M. Foster T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6821-6829Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Consistent with this, ClfA has a putative EF-hand motif (residues 310–321) within the A region that is required both for Ca2+ regulation and ligand binding (see Fig. 1) (20O'Connell D.P. Nanavaty T. McDevitt D. Gurusiddappa S. Höök M. Foster T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6821-6829Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Overlapping this putative EF-hand motif is another motif (YTFTDYV) that occurs in the same position in the A regions of the other members of the Sdr protein family and also in the A regions of the fibronectin-binding MSCRAMMs (FnbpA and FnbpB) of S. aureus (see Fig. 1) (10Josefsson E. McCrea K.W., Nı́ Eidhin D. O'Connell D. Cox J. Höök M. Foster T.J. Microbiology (Read.). 1998; 144: 3387-3395Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). However, the function of this motif is currently unknown. In a previous study, we sought to identify the Fg-binding site within ClfA by constructing a series of recombinant truncates of the A region of this protein (14McDevitt D. François P. Vaudaux P. Foster T.J. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 16: 895-907Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). This analysis revealed that the smallest recombinant truncate that retained Fg-binding activity was composed of residues 221–550. Further truncation of either the N or C terminus of this construct resulted in the loss of Fg-binding activity, suggesting that the overall conformation of the protein is important in maintaining the integrity of the Fg-binding site. However, it was also noted that a non-Fg-binding truncate, composed of residues 332–550, retained the ability to absorb out the clumping-blocking activity of polyclonal antibodies (Abs) raised against the entire A region (residues 40–559), whereas another truncate, composed of residues 221–484, did not (14McDevitt D. François P. Vaudaux P. Foster T.J. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 16: 895-907Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). These observations raise the possibility that the C-terminal part of the A region of ClfA (between residues 484 and 500) may contain at least part of the Fg-binding site of this protein. In this study, we investigated the role of the C-terminal part of the A region in the Fg-binding activity of ClfA. We found that polyclonal antibodies raised against a recombinant ClfA truncate, composed of residues 500–559 of the A region, blocked the interaction of bothS. aureus and recombinant ClfA with immobilized Fg. In addition, using site-directed mutagenesis, we identified two adjacent residues, Glu526 and Val527, within this part of the A region that are important for the interaction of ClfA with both soluble and immobilized Fg. Escherichia coliXL-1 Blue (Stratagene) was used for plasmid cloning and protein expression. S. aureus strain RN4220 was the recipient used for introducing plasmids into S. aureus by electroporation. Plasmids were subsequently transferred to DU5941, a mutant of S. aureus strain 8325-4 lacking expression of both ClfA and protein A (strain 8325-4 clfA1::Tn917Δspa::TcR) (23Hartford O. François P. Vaudaux P. Foster T.J. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 25: 1065-1076Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Strain DU5873, a mutant of strain Newman lacking expression of protein A (strain Newman Δspa::TcR) (14McDevitt D. François P. Vaudaux P. Foster T.J. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 16: 895-907Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar) was used for the antibody inhibition studies. The shuttle plasmid pCU1 (24Augustin J. Gotz F. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1990; 54: 203-207Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which confers resistance to chloramphenicol in S. aureus and ampicillin in E. coli, was used to express the wild-type and mutant ClfA proteins in strain DU5941. Plasmids pQE30 (QIAGEN Inc.) and pGEX-KG (25Guan K.L. Dixon J.E. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 192: 262-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (1641) Google Scholar) were used for recombinant protein expression. E. colistrains harboring plasmids were routinely grown in L-broth or on L-agar (26Miller J.H. Experiments in Molecular Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1972Google Scholar). S. aureus cultures were grown in trypticase soy broth or on trypticase soy agar. Ampicillin (100 μg/ml) was used for the selection of plasmids in E. coli, and chloramphenicol (10 μg/ml), erythromycin (3 μg/ml), or tetracycline (2 μg/ml) was used for selection of plasmids or chromosomal markers in S. aureus. E. coli XL-1 Blue cells were made competent by CaCl2 treatment (27Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Electrocompetent S. aureus cells were prepared by the method of Oskouian and Stewart (28Oskouian B. Stewart G.C. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 3804-3812Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The pCU1-derived plasmids were initially introduced into S. aureus strain RN4220 by electroporation (29Schenck S. Laddaga R.A. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1992; 73: 133-138Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) with a Gene Pulser II set at 2.3 kV, 25 microfarads, and 100 ohms in a 0.2-cm cuvette and were subsequently transduced to strain DU5941 using phage 85 (30). DNA manipulations were performed by standard procedures (27Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Plasmid DNA for cloning and sequence analysis was purified using the WizardTM Plus miniprep kit (Promega). PCR-amplified DNA was purified using the WizardTM PCR prep kit (Promega). DNA restriction and modification enzymes were purchased from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. Double-stranded plasmid DNA was sequenced by the dideoxy chain termination method (27Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) using the Taq DyeDeoxy Terminator Cycle sequencing kit and an automated sequencer (Applied Biosystems Model 373A). The PCR mixtures contained 100 ng of template DNA, 100 pmol of forward and reverse primer, 200 μm dNTP, ThermoPol reaction buffer (New England Biolabs Inc.), and 1 unit of Vent® polymerase (New England Biolabs Inc.). All reactions were carried out with a 1-min denaturation step at 94 °C, a 1-min annealing step at 50–60 °C (depending on the primer pair), and an extension time of 1 min/1 kilobase pair of DNA to be amplified. The standard cycle was repeated for 30 cycles, followed by incubation at 72 °C for 10 min. PCR amplifications were performed using a PerkinElmer Life Sciences DNA thermocycler. Restriction enzyme sites were incorporated at the 5′-end of the primers to facilitate subsequent cloning of the PCR products into the appropriate plasmid vector. A previously described PCR method was used to introduce site-directed mutations into theclfA gene (20O'Connell D.P. Nanavaty T. McDevitt D. Gurusiddappa S. Höök M. Foster T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6821-6829Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Briefly, the shuttle plasmid expressing the mutant ClfA protein with the E526A substitution was constructed as follows. Using S. aureus strain Newman genomic DNA as template, a 915-base pair fragment of the clfA gene was amplified using the flanking primer F1 (covering the PstI site in clfA) and the internal primer R2 (incorporating aBglII site and the nucleotide mismatch required for the desired mutation) (Table I). In a second PCR, a 1135-base pair fragment of the clfA gene was amplified using the internal primer F2 (incorporating aBglII site) and the flanking primer R1 (incorporating aHindIII site) (Table I). Primer R1 was complementary to noncoding sequences 100 base pairs downstream from the clfAstop codon in the chromosome. The two PCR products were then cleaved with PstI and BglII or with BglII andHindIII, as appropriate, and ligated together at theBglII site. The mutant PstI-HindIIIclfA gene fragment was cloned into plasmid pCF77 (pCU1 carrying a copy of the wild-type clfA gene (23Hartford O. François P. Vaudaux P. Foster T.J. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 25: 1065-1076Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar)), yielding plasmid pClfA(E526A). This cloning reaction was facilitated by the presence of a unique PstI site in the wild-typeclfA gene and involved replacing the wild-typePstI-HindIII clfA gene fragment in pCF77 with the mutant PstI-HindIIIclfA gene fragment. The pCF77-derived plasmids expressing the ClfA proteins with the substitutions N525A, V527S, E526A/V527S, A528V/G532A, D537A, E546A, and E559A were generated in a similar fashion using the primers indicated in Table I. The DNA sequence of each of the mutations was verified as described above.Table ISynthetic oligonucleotides for amplifying clfA gene fragments from S. aureus strain Newman genomic DNA and for site-directed mutagenesis of clfApCF77-derived mutant shuttle plasmids Flanking primers F1TATGGATCCATGGTAGCTGCAGATGGCACC R1GCCAAGCTTGTCAGTTTCAACGACTCA Internal primers pClfA(E526A) F2GGCAGATCTATGTCATGGGACAACGCAGTAGCATTT R2GGCAGATCTCCAAATTATATTCGAGTTATACCC pClfA(V527S) F3GCCGGATCCGGTTCTGGTGACGGTATCGAT R3ACCGGATCCGTTATTAAATGCTGATTCGTTGTC pClfA(E526A/V527S) F4GCCGGATCCGGTTCTGGTGACGGTATCGAT R4ACCGGATCCGTTATTAAATGCTGATGCGTTGTC pClfA(N525A) F5CCGGGATCCGGTTCTGGTGACGGTATCGATAA R5ACGGATCCGTTATTAAATGCTACTTCGGCGTCCCATG pClfA(D537A) F6GGCGGATCCGGTTCTGGTGCCGGTATCGAT R6GGCGGATCCGTTATTAAATGCTACTTCGTTGTC pClfA(E546A) F7GGCCCCGGGGAAATTGAACCAATTCCAGAGGATTC R7GCCCCCGGGCGCATCAGGTTGTTCAGGAACAAC pClfA(E559A) F8GCCCCGGGGAAATTGAACCAATTCCAGCGGATTCAG R8CGGCCCGGGCTCATCAGGTTGTTCAGGAAC pClfA(A528V/G532A) F9CAACGAAGTAGTATTTAATAACGCATCAGGTTCTGGT R9ACCAGAACCTGATGCGTTATTAAATACTACTTCGTTGTCpQE30-derived mutant expression plasmids pClfA-(221–559) (E526A) F1-ATATGGATCCATGGTAGCTGCAGATGGCACC R1-ACGCAAGCTTCTCTGGAATTGGTTCAATTTC pClfA-(221–559) (V527S) F2-ATATAGATCTGTAGCTGCAGATGGCACC R1-ACGCAAGCTTCTCTGGAATTGGTTCAATTTC pClfA-(221–559) (E526A/V527S) F2-ATATAGATCTGTAGCTGCAGATGGCACC R1-ACGCAAGCTTCTCTGGAATTGGTTCAATTTC pClfA-(221–559) (A528V/G532A) F1-ATATGGATCCATGGTAGCTGCAGATGGCACC R1-ACGCAAGCTTCTCTGGAATTGGTTCAATTTCpGST-ClfA-(500–559) expression plasmid F10GGCGGATCCGGTGATTTAGCTTTACGTTC R10CGCAAGCTTCTCTGGAATTGGTTCAATTTRestriction endonuclease sites are underlined.

The E526A, V527S, E526A/V527S, and A528V/G532A substitutions were introduced into a recombinant protein composed of residues 221–559 of ClfA, called rClfA-(221–559) (previously called Clf41 (20O'Connell D.P.

To construct the plasmids expressing rClfA-(221–559) with the E526A and A528V/G532A substitutions, a 1019-base pair fragment (encoding residues 221–559) was amplified from the pCF77-derived plasmid carrying the mutant clfA gene of interest using primers F1-A (incorporating a BamHI site) and R1-A (incorporating a HindIII site) (Table I). The amplified DNA was then cleaved with BamHI and HindIII and ligated into the expression vector pQE30, which was also cleaved with these enzymes. To construct the plasmids expressing rClfA-(221–559) with the V527S and E526A/V527S substitutions, primers F2-A (incorporating a BglII site) and R1-A were used (Table I). The amplified DNA was then cleaved with BglII andHindIII and ligated into pQE30, which was cleaved withBamHI and HindIII. The DNA sequence of each of the mutations was verified as described above. Construction of the plasmid expressing wild-type rClfA-(221–559) has been described previously (20O'Connell D.P. Nanavaty T. McDevitt D. Gurusiddappa S. Höök M. Foster T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6821-6829Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). The rClfA-(221–559) proteins expressed from pQE30 contained an N-terminal extension of six histidine residues (His tag), facilitating purification by immobilized metal chelate affinity chromatography. DNA encoding residues 500–559 of the A region of ClfA was amplified by PCR with primers F10 (incorporating a BamHI site) and R10 (incorporating a HindIII site) (Table I) usingS. aureus strain Newman genomic DNA as template. The amplified product was cloned into plasmid pGEX-KG and cleaved withBamHI and HindIII, yielding plasmid pGST-ClfA-(500–559). The recombinant fusion protein expressed was called rGST-ClfA-(500–559). Cells harboring the pQE30-derived plasmids were grown, and bacterial cell lysates were prepared as described previously (20O'Connell D.P. Nanavaty T. McDevitt D. Gurusiddappa S. Höök M. Foster T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6821-6829Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). The fusion proteins containing an N-terminal His tag were purified by immobilized metal chelate affinity chromatography as described previously (31Wann E.R. Gurusiddappa S. Höök M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 13863-13871Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). Cells harboring plasmid pGST-ClfA-(500–559) were grown, and the rGST-ClfA-(500–559) protein was purified on a glutathione-Sepharose column as described previously (7Nı́ Eidhin D. Perkins S. François P. Vaudaux P. Höök M. Foster T.J. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 30: 245-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). Polyclonal Abs to rGST-ClfA-(500–559) were prepared by immunizing a New Zealand White rabbit subcutaneously with 50 μg of the recombinant protein emulsified with an equal volume of Freund's complete adjuvant. The rabbit was boosted twice over a period of 1 month with the same amount of antigen in Freund's incomplete adjuvant. The immunoglobulins were precipitated with 25% ammonium sulfate, and IgG was purified by affinity chromatography on a protein A-Sepharose 4B column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was performed by standard methods (32Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207538) Google Scholar). Proteins were visualized on gels by Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 staining. S. aureus cell wall proteins were prepared from stabilized protoplasts by digestion with lysostaphin (Ambicin L recombinant lysostaphin, Applied Microbiology) as described previously (23Hartford O. François P. Vaudaux P. Foster T.J. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 25: 1065-1076Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). For the Western immunoblot assay, released cell wall-associated proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) using a semidry system (Bio-Rad) as described previously (23Hartford O. François P. Vaudaux P. Foster T.J. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 25: 1065-1076Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Remaining protein-binding sites were blocked by incubating the membranes in 5% (w/v) nonfat dry milk in Tris-buffered saline (TBS; 10 mmTris-HCl and 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.4) for 18 h at 4 °C. The ClfA proteins were detected with rabbit anti-rClfA-(40–559) polyclonal Abs (diluted 1:1000 in blocking reagent), followed by horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated protein A (diluted 1:500 in blocking reagent; Sigma). Bound protein A was detected by enhanced chemiluminescence (New England Biolabs Inc.). For the Western ligand affinity blot assay, the recombinant ClfA proteins were transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, and the membranes were incubated with blocking reagent as described above. The membranes were then incubated with HRP-conjugated human Fg (10 μg/ml in blocking reagent), and bound protein was visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence. Human Fg (Calbiochem) was conjugated to HRP according to the manufacturer's instructions (Pierce). Bacterial cell immunoblot assays were performed as described previously (33Hartford O. McDevitt D. Foster T.J. Microbiology (Read.). 1999; 145: 2497-2505Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) using S. aureus cultures grown in trypticase soy broth for 15 h at 37 °C with aeration. S. aureus strains were grown in trypticase soy broth for 15 h at 37 °C with aeration, harvested by centrifugation at 3000 × g for 10 min, and washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; Oxoid Ltd.). A suspension of ∼4 × 108 colony-forming units in a 20-μl volume was added to 50 μl of 2-fold serial dilutions of human Fg (starting at 1 mg/ml) in the wells of a microtiter plate. The reciprocal of the highest dilution of Fg giving clumping after 5 min was defined as the titer. S. aureus strains were grown in trypticase soy broth for 15 h at 37 °C with aeration, harvested by centrifugation at 3000 × g, and washed with PBS. For the inhibition of bacterial adherence by the anti-rGST-ClfA-(500–559) polyclonal Abs, 2-fold serial dilutions of purified IgG in PBS were preincubated with strain DU5873 cells (∼5 × 107 colony-forming units) with shaking for 2 h at room temperature. Strain DU5873 (a protein A-deficient mutant of strain Newman) was used in this assay to prevent the nonimmune reaction between IgG and protein A. The cells were then transferred to wells in a microtiter plate (Sarstedt, Inc.) coated with human Fg (500 ng/well), and bacterial adherence was measured using crystal violet staining as described previously (23Hartford O. François P. Vaudaux P. Foster T.J. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 25: 1065-1076Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Polyclonal Abs raised against a recombinant form of the Fg-binding region of ClfB (rGST-ClfB-(45–542)) were used as a control in this assay (7Nı́ Eidhin D. Perkins S. François P. Vaudaux P. Höök M. Foster T.J. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 30: 245-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). Measurement of the relative adherence of strain DU5941 (∼1 × 108 colony-forming units), expressing wild-type and mutant ClfA proteins, to immobilized human Fg was also performed using crystal violet staining as described previously (23Hartford O. François P. Vaudaux P. Foster T.J. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 25: 1065-1076Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). For the Ab inhibition studies, a recombinant His-tagged protein composed of the entire A region of ClfA, called rClfA-(40–559), was used (previously called Clf40 (20O'Connell D.P. Nanavaty T.

The wells of microtiter plates were coated with 1 μg of human Fg (Enzyme Research Laboratories) for 18 h at 4 °C. After washing with TBS, the wells were blocked with 5% (w/v) bovine serum albumin (BSA) in TBS for 2 h at room temperature and then washed again with TBS containing 0.05% Tween 20 (TBS-T). The rClfA-(40–559) protein (10 nm) was preincubated with increasing concentrations of the polyclonal Abs in TBS containing 0.1% BSA for 1 h at room temperature. The samples were then added to the Fg-coated wells for 1 h at room temperature. The wells were washed with TBS-T, and bound protein was detected with an anti-His tag monoclonal antibody"
https://openalex.org/W1997347495,"The two clathrin-associated adaptor complexes AP1 and AP2 are known to participate in the formation of clathrin-coated vesicles at the trans-Golgi network and at the plasma membrane. During this process adaptors are involved in the sequestration of vesicle cargo by binding to the sorting signals within the cytoplasmic domains of the cargo proteins and in the recruitment of the clathrin coat. After budding of the clathrin-coated vesicles, the clathrin and adaptors dissociate from the vesicles. Here we show that in vitro binding of AP2 to sorting signals, which is one of the initial steps in receptor-mediated endocytosis, is modulated by adaptor phosphorylation. AP2 was phosphorylated by incubating purified AP2 in the presence of ATP and dephosphorylated by incubation with alkaline phosphatase. Affinity for tyrosine-, leucine-based and noncanonical sorting motifs was 15–33 times higher for phosphorylated than for dephosphorylated AP2. Also the binding of AP2 to membranes was regulated by adaptor phosphorylation/dephosphorylation and was about 8-fold higher for phosphorylated than for dephosphorylated AP2. Moreover, AP2 isolated from cytosol is higher phosphorylated than membrane-extracted and exhibits a 5-fold higher binding affinity than AP2 extracted from membranes. Taken together these data point to a cycle of phosphorylation/dephosphorylation as a mechanism for regulating the reversible association of AP2 with membranes and sorting signals during the process of receptor-mediated endocytosis.

Taken together these data point to a cycle of phosphorylation/dephosphorylation as a mechanism for regulating the reversible association of AP2 with membranes and sorting signals during the process of receptor-mediated endocytosis. clathrin-coated vesicle(s) trans-Golgi network normal rat kidney Madin-Darby-Bovine-Kidney polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis high pressure liquid chromatography 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid Trafficking of membrane proteins within the secretory and endocytic route of eukaryotic cells is characterized by the sorting of the membrane proteins at sites where transport pathways diverge and the packaging of the membrane proteins into vesicles occurs. The adaptors AP1 and AP2 appear to play a key role in the sorting and packaging of membrane proteins in clathrin-coated vesicles (CCVs).1 AP1-containing CCVs are formed at the TGN and facilitate the transport of cargo from the TGN to endosomes, whereas AP2-containing CCVs function in receptor-mediated endocytosis at the plasma membrane. The adaptors are heterotetrameric complexes composed of two 100-kDa subunits (designated γ and β1 in AP1 and α and β2 in AP2; for review see Ref.1Lewin D. Mellman I. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1401: 129-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The α-, β1-, and β2-subunits have been implicated in clathrin binding (2Goodman O.B. Keen J.H. J. Biol.

Yeh D. Taurus D. Saito T. Bonifacino J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25915-25921Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar), but also the β-subunits have been implicated in binding to membrane targets (6Beltzer J.P. Spiess M. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 3735-3742Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 7Rapoport I. Chen Y. Cupers P. Shoelson S. Kirchhausen T. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2148-2155Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). Tyrosine- and leucine-based sorting motifs in cytoplasmic tails of membrane proteins can serve as adaptor binding sites, and the tyrosine and leucine residues have been shown to be critical for the sorting of the membrane proteins, as well as for the adaptor binding (for review see Ref. 8Heilker R. Spiess M. Crottet P. BioAssays. 1999; 21: 558-567Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). For noncanonical sequences mediating either sorting or adaptor binding, this correlation, however, remains to be established. After formation of the CCVs, the clathrin coat is removed by the uncoating ATPase (hsc70) in a reaction depending on ATP hydrolysis (9Braell W.A. Schlossman D.M. Schmid S.L. Rothman J.E. J. Cell Biol. 1984; 99: 734-741Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 10Höning S. Kreimer G. Robenek H. Jockusch B.M. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 1185-1196PubMed Google Scholar, 11Hannan L. Newmeyer S. Schmid S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 2217-2229Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The adaptors are removed by a yet uncharacterized reaction. Thus adaptors associate with specific membranes such as the TGN or the plasma membrane and dissociate from the vesicles budding from these membranes. The mechanisms that control the association of adaptors with and their dissociation from membranes are unknown. In principle three different mechanisms can be envisaged. First, the adaptors may become specifically modified before they bind to or dissociate from membranes. Second the targets in membranes, to which adaptors bind, are subject to a covalent modification prior to binding or to dissociation. Third, a change of the internal milieu of CCVs,e.g. by an ion pump, may translate into a conformational change of the target e.g. by altering its oligomeric state. Several components of CCVs are subject to phosphorylation, including clathrin, adaptors, and cytoplasmic tails of cargo proteins, which serve as membrane targets (12Hill B.L. Drickamer K. Brodsky F.M. Parham P. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 5499-5501Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Wilde A. Brodsky F.M. J.

Cell. 1999; 10: 677-691Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Furthermore several kinases are associated with CCVs and purified adaptors (15Pauloin A. Thurieau C. Biochem. J. 1993; 296: 409-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 16Bar-Zvi D. Mosley T. Branton D. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 4408-4415Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Morris S. Mann A. Ungewickell E. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 3354-3357Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The phosphorylation of membrane-associated and cytosolic AP2 has been shown to be different, with cytosolic AP2 being the higher phosphorylated species (13Wilde A. Brodsky F.M. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 635-645Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). These observations point to a role of adaptor phosphorylation for regulating its binding to membranes. In the present study we analyzed the effect of phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of purified adaptors on the binding to peptides representing adaptor binding sequences, and we also analyzed AP2 binding to membranes. We observed that phosphorylation of AP2 enhances the association constant for in vitro binding to various AP2 binding motifs and the recruitment of AP2 to membranes, whereas dephosphorylation has the opposite effect. The phosphorylation of the α-, β2-, and μ2-subunit is catalyzed by kinases copurifying with AP2. Furthermore, cytosolic AP2 is higher phosphorylated and has a higher binding affinity as compared with membrane-extracted AP2. Taken together these data suggest that a cycle of phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of AP2 is regulating the binding of AP2 to membranes. NRK and MDBK cells were obtained from ATCC (Manassas, VA) and cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 10% fetal calf serum. Antibodies specific for subunits of AP2 were obtained from Sigma (anti-γ and anti-α) and from Transduction Laboratories (anti-α and anti-β). The antibodies specific for μ2 and ς2 were kindly provided by M. S. Robinson (Cambridge, United Kingdom). Clathrin-coated vesicles were prepared from porcine brain according to Keen et al. (18Keen J.H. Willingham M.C. Pastan I.H. Cell. 1979; 16: 303-312Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). Coat proteins were extracted from CCVs with 0.5 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, for 1 h under rotation. After centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 30 min, the material was applied to a Superose-6 column (1.6 × 55 cm) connected to a fast protein liquid chromatography system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) at a flow rate of 0.3 ml/min. The column was equilibrated in 0.5m Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, 0.2 mm dithiothreitol. 1.5-ml fractions were collected, and adaptor-containing fractions were identified by SDS-PAGE. For the separation of AP1 from AP2, the adaptor-containing fractions were pooled and applied to hydroxyapatite chromatography according to Manfredi and Bazari (19Manfredi J.J. Bazari W.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 12182-12188Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The purity of AP1 and AP2 was analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting using monoclonal antibodies to the α-subunit of AP2 or the γ-subunit of AP1. Peptides were synthesized using amino acids protected with Fmoc (N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl) and activated with benzotriazol-1-yl-oxytripyrolidinophosphonium hexafluorophosphate and a 9050 peptide synthesizer (Millipore). After cleavage from the resin and the protecting groups, peptides were purified by reverse phase HPLC using Delta Pac C-18 column (Millipore) and an elution from 0–50% acetonitrile in 0.1% trifluoroacetic, water for 50 min. Purity was confirmed by HPLC, UV spectrometry, and mass spectrometry. Peptides corresponding to the tail sequences of the following membrane proteins were used in this study: from lysosomal acid phosphatase (RMQAQPPGYRHVADGQDHA), from the 67 residues comprising MPR46 tail the residues 2–16 (RLVVGAKGMEQFPHL) and 49–67 (GDDQLGEESEERDDHLLPM), and from invariant chain (MDDQRDLISNNEQLP-MLGRRPGAPESKCSR). The latter one was produced as a glutathione S-transferase fusion protein and was used as described (20Hofmann M. Höning S. Rodionov D. Dobberstein B. von Figura K. Bakke O. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36153-36158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). AP1 and AP2 were dialyzed into Buffer A (20 mm Hepes-NaOH, pH 7.0, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm KCl, 2 mmMgCl2, 0.2 mm dithiothreitol) and incubated with various amounts of alkaline phosphatase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) for 30 min at 37 °C. AP2 was dialyzed against 50 mmHepes-KOH, pH 7.4, 5 mm MgCl2, 2 mmMnCl2 and incubated with 1 μl of [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for 15 min at room temperature. The reaction was stopped by the addition of sample buffer and boiling for 5 min at 95 °C. The probes were analyzed by SDS-PAGE, autoradiography, and Western blotting with antibodies against the α-, β2- and μ2-subunits. For experiments including kinase inhibitors, a mixture of threonine and serine kinase inhibitors was used (catalog number 539572; Calbiochem). For phosphorylation with unlabeled ATP, AP2 was dialyzed into Buffer A and incubated for 30 min at 37 °C in the presence of 2 mmATP. To test for phosphatases copurifying with AP2, the adaptor was first incubated with [γ-32P]ATP for 30 min at 37 °C, was then treated with kinase inhibitors, and further incubated for up to 2 h at 37 °C. Subsequently, the samples were resolved on SDS-PAGE and analyzed after autoradiography. AP2 that was incubated in parallel with unlabeled ATP was analyzed for tail binding by using the biosensor. For phosphorylation with unlabeled ATP, AP2 was dialyzed into Buffer A and incubated for 30 min at 37 °C in the presence of 2 mm ATP. NRK cells were grown to confluency on a 15-cm dish. The cells were washed two times with phosphate-buffered saline, scraped in Buffer B (25 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.2, 125 mm KAc, 5 mm MgAc), and lysed by passing the suspension through a 22×g syringe 10 times. The cell lysate was centrifuged for 10 min at 1000 × g to remove intact cells and nuclei. The supernatant was removed and centrifuged for 30 min at 100,000 ×g to separate membranes (pellet) from the cytosol (supernatant). The membrane pellet was incubated for 1 h with 0.5m Tris-HCL, pH 7.5, to remove endogenous AP2. Subsequently the membranes were recovered by centrifugation at 100,000 ×g, solubilized in Buffer B, and stored in aliquots at −70 °C until use. AP2 was dialyzed in Buffer B, pre-incubated with alkaline phosphatase or ATP, and incubated with NRK membranes for 30 min on ice. The membranes were recovered by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 15 min, solubilized in 2× sample buffer, resolved by SDS-PAGE, and analyzed by Western blotting with an antibody against the α-subunit of AP2. The interaction between AP1, AP2, or MDBK cytosolic and membrane fractions and the cytoplasmic tail peptides was analyzed in real time by surface plasmon resonance using a BIAcore 2000 biosensor (BIAcore AB). The peptides were coupled to a CM5 sensor chip via their primary amino groups following the manufacturer's instructions (immobilized ligands). Peptides with an isoelectric point below 3.5 could not be immobilized to the CM5 sensor chip via amino coupling because of their low pI. These peptides were immobilized to the sensor surface via the thiol group of a cysteine residue that was synthesized at the amino terminus (for details see Ref. 21Höning S. Sandoval I. von Figura K. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1304-1314Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). AP1 and AP2 (analytes) were injected at a flow rate of 20 μl/min unless stated otherwise. The adaptors were used at concentrations ranging from 50–350 nm to avoid mass transport effects that can occur if the analyte concentration is low. For cytosolic and membrane-extracted adaptors, concentrations were used ranging from 5–11 nmbecause of the limited amount of adaptors. Association (1–2 min) was followed by dissociation (2 min) during which Buffer A was perfused. Subsequently bound APs were removed by a short pulse injection (15 s) of 10 mm NaOH, 0.5% SDS. The rate constants (ka for association andkd for dissociation) of the interaction between tail peptides and the adaptor complexes were calculated by using the evaluation software of the BIAcore 2000. Association was determined 15–20 s after switching from buffer flow to adaptor solution to avoid distortions because of injection and mixing. The dissociation rate constants were determined 5–10 s after switching to buffer flow. The association rate constant ka, the dissociation rate constant kd, and the calculation of the equilibrium rate constant, KD =kd/ka, were determined by assuming a first order kinetic A + B = AB. Further details are described elsewhere (22Höning S. Sosa M. Hille-Rehfeld A. von Figura K. J. Biol.

MDBK cells were harvested in 100 mm Mes, pH 6.8, 1 mm EGTA, 0.5 mm MgCl2, and 0.2 mm dithiothreitol and lysed by passing the suspension through a 22×g syringe 10 times. The cell lysate was centrifuged at 1000 × g to remove intact cells and nuclei. The supernatant was removed and centrifuged for 30 min at 100,000 × g to separate membranes from the cytosol. The pellet was extracted with 0.5 m Tris, pH 7.5, and centrifuged for 30 min at 100,000 × g. For gel filtration the cytosol and the membrane extract (50-μl aliquots) were passed over a Superdex-200 column connected to a SMART™ system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), equilibrated, and eluted with Buffer A at a flow rate of 40 μl/min. Fractions of 50 μl were collected and analyzed by Western blotting using an antibody against the α-subunit of AP2. The AP2-positive fractions were combined and stored at −70 °C. AP2 was dialyzed against Buffer A and incubated with alkaline phosphatase for 30 min at 37 °C. AP2 was precipitated with methanol/chloroform (24Wessel D. Flugge U.I. Anal. Biochem. 1984; 138: 141-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (3161) Google Scholar), subjected to isoelectric focusing according to Braun et al. (25Braun M.A. Waheed A. von Figura K. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 3633-3640Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar), transferred onto nitrocellulose, and analyzed by Western blotting with antibodies against the four subunits of AP2.

To test whether dephosphorylation of adaptors affects their binding to the cytoplasmic tails of transmembrane cargo proteins of CCVs, AP1 and AP2 purified from pig brain were treated with alkaline phosphatase. Following this treatment, the binding of adaptors to a peptide derived from the cytoplasmic tail of MPR46 was analyzed by surface plasmon resonance. MPR46 is a cargo molecule of AP1 CCVs at the TGN and of AP2 CCVs at the plasma membrane. The peptide representing residues 49–67 of the cytoplasmic tail of MPR46 is known to bind AP1 and AP2 with high affinity (22Höning S. Sosa M. Hille-Rehfeld A. von Figura K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19884-19890Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). A corresponding peptide in which the critical dileucine motif was mutated to a pair of alanines served as a control for AP2 binding. Treatment with phosphatase had only a minor effect on the affinity of AP1, whereas the affinity of AP2 was decreased about 20-fold from a KD of 16 nm to a KD of 366 nm. The decrease in affinity was because of a lower association rate constant (see Fig.1 and TableI). The effect of alkaline phosphatase treatment was dependent on the concentration of alkaline phosphatase (Fig. 2) and sensitive to the inhibition by 1 mm pyrophosphate or 1 mm vanadate (data not shown).Table IRate constants for the binding of AP1 and AP2 to the MPR46 tail peptide 49–67PhosphataseAP1AP2k ak dK Dk ak dK D1/M × s1/snm1/M × s1/snm−15 × 1043.9 × 10−32625 × 1044.1 × 10−316+8.9 × 1043.4 × 10−3381.5 × 1045.5 × 10−3366Purified AP1 and AP2 were incubated for 30 min at 37 °C in the absence or presence of 2 units of alkaline phosphatase.

The rate constants for association (k a), dissociation (k d), and the equilibrium rate constant (K D = k d/k a) were determined from the sensorgrams shown in Fig. 1. In bovine kidney cells all subunits of AP2 except for the ς2-subunit are known to exist as phosphoproteins (13Wilde A. Brodsky F.M. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 635-645Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Isoelectric focusing of AP2 prior to and after phosphatase treatment confirmed these data for AP2 subunits from pig brain. The α-, β2-, and μ2-subunit exist as multiple forms, whereas the ς2-subunit exists as a single form. Phosphatase treatment shifted the pattern of the α-, β2-, and μ2-subunits toward more basic forms, whereas it did not affect the isoelectric point of ς2 (shown for α, β2, and ς in Fig.3). We conclude from these data that three of the four subunits of AP2 are phosphorylated and that dephosphorylation of AP2 reduces its high affinity in vitrobinding to a peptide derived from a transmembrane cargo protein of CCVs. AP2 recognizes in cytoplasmic tails of transmembrane proteins tyrosine- and leucine based- and noncanonical sorting motifs (8Heilker R. Spiess M. Crottet P. BioAssays. 1999; 21: 558-567Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 26Sandoval I.V. Bakke O. Trends Cell Biol. 1994; 4: 292-297Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). The tail peptide 49–67 of MPR46 contains a leucine-based and a noncanonical AP2 binding motif that can substitute each other (22Höning S. Sosa M. Hille-Rehfeld A. von Figura K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19884-19890Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). To determine whether dephosphorylation of AP2 reduces binding to either of these motifs, binding to the lysosomal acid phosphatase (LAP) tail peptide, the invariant chain tail peptide, and the MPR46 tail peptide 2–16 was determined. These peptides are known to bind AP2 via a tyrosine-based signal (LAP, 27), a leucine-based signal (invariant chain, 20), or a noncanonical sorting motif MPR46, 22). Alkaline phosphatase treatment reduced the affinity to any of the three classes of AP2 binding motifs by 4- to 15-fold (TableII). As for the MPR46 peptide 49–67 this decrease in affinity resulted almost exclusively from lower association rate constants (not shown).Table IIAP2 binding to tail peptides containing different sorting signalsAP2 treatmentK D (nm)NoATPPhosphataseLAP6423544Inv. chain250681011MPR46 (2–16)2210335MPR46 (49–67)177330Peptides corresponding to the cytoplasmic tails of LAP, invariant chain, and MPR46 were immobilized on a sensor surface and probed for AP2 binding as described above.

The decrease or increase of the K D caused by preincubation with ATP or alkaline phosphatase resulted from changes of the association rate constants (not shown).

Prior to tail peptide binding, AP2 was kept untreated or incubated with ATP (2 mm) or alkaline phosphatase (2 units) for 30 min at 37 °C. The equilibrium rate constants (K D) for the AP2 interaction with the various tail peptides were calculated from the BIAcore sensorgrams. The decrease or increase of the K D caused by preincubation with ATP or alkaline phosphatase resulted from changes of the association rate constants (not shown). Endogenous kinases associated with purified AP2 are known to phosphorylate AP2 subunits (17Morris S. Mann A. Ungewickell E. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 3354-3357Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,19Manfredi J.J. Bazari W.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 12182-12188Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). When AP2 purified from pig brain was incubated in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP, incorporation of32P into the α-, β2-, and μ2-subunits was observed (Fig. 4). To test the influence of AP2 phosphorylation and dephosphorylation more precisely, we purified AP2 and devided the preparation into three aliquots. One aliquot was treated with alkaline phosphatase, one was incubated in the presence of ATP to allow phosphorylation by copurified kinases, and one aliquot served as a nontreated control. One-third of each sample was subsequently analyzed for binding to the MPR46 tail peptide 49–67 (Fig. 5 B), whereas the remaining sample was subjected to isoelectric focusing, followed by Western blotting and detection of the AP2 β-subunit (Fig.5 A). As shown in Fig. 5 A, the purified AP2 β-subunit (mock) exists as two major forms with pIs of 6.5 and 7.2 (Fig. 5 A, lane 1). Incubation with alkaline phosphatase resulted in a shift of almost all β2 to the basic form (lane 2). When incubated in the presence of ATP, β2 was converted to more acidic forms (lane 3). A similar result was obtained for the α-subunit (data not shown). This indicates that the bulk of isolated AP2 represents a partially phosphorylated form (dash), which is converted by dephosphorylation or phosphorylation into more basic (open triangle) or acidic (filled triangle) forms, respectively. In conclusion, dephosphorylation of AP2 with alkaline phosphatase or phosphorylation by copurifying kinases changes the phosphorylation state of the entire AP2 pool and not just of a fraction of it. When the same aliquots were analyzed for binding to the MPR46 tail peptide 49–67 (see Fig. 5 B and Table II), the phosphorylation of AP2 by endogenous kinases led to a 2.5-fold enhanced association rate to the peptide 49–67 of MPR46 (Fig. 5 B,+ATP) as compared with untreated AP2 (mock). On the other hand, the phosphatase-treated AP2 sample exhibited a 20-fold decreased affinity for the tail peptide, clearly demonstrating that the phosphorylation status of AP2 is a critical determinant for the binding to sorting signals. Phosphorylation also enhanced the affinity of AP2 to pe343 ptides representing tyrosine- and leucine-based and noncanonical AP2 binding motifs 2- to 4-fold (Table II). The presence of 150 μg/ml polylysine during the phosphorylation reaction affected neither the incorporation of 32P into nor the affinity of AP2 (not shown). We conclude from these data that in vitro phosphorylation of AP2 by associated kinases enhances the affinity of AP2 to the different classes of AP2 binding motifs. When phosphorylated AP2 was incubated in the presence of general protein kinase inhibitors for 30 min at 37 °C, no dephosphorylation was detectable (not shown). This suggests that in contrast to kinases, endogenous phosphatases are not associated with purified AP2. The experiments described above had demonstrated the dependence of in vitro binding of AP2 to immobilized peptides by the phosphorylation status of AP2. Next we assayed whether phosphorylation or dephosphorylation of AP2 affects its binding to membranes. A membrane fraction was prepared from NRK cells and stripped from endogenous adaptors by treatment with 0.5m Tris, pH 7.5. The purified AP2 was incubated for 30 min at 37 °C in the presence of ATP, and subsequently the AP2 was placed on ice and incubated for 30 min in the presence of membranes. Membrane-associated AP2 was then pelleted and quantified by Western blotting (Fig. 6). Incubation of AP2 in the presence of ATP increases the amount of membrane-bound AP2 as compared with a control in which AP2 was incubated in the absence of ATP by 4.1 ± 1.0-fold (n = 5). Under the experimental conditions used, the ATP that was used to stimulate the phosphorylation of AP2 may also affect the phosphorylation status of some membrane components even at 4 °C. To rule out this possibility, AP2 was cleared from ATP by centrifugation through a high molecular weight cut-off filter and then incubated with the membranes. The stimulation of AP2 binding was similar as before (data not shown), indicating that it is the phosphorylation of AP2 that increases the AP2 association with membranes. The amount of membrane binding of AP2 was lowered by 2.0 ± 1.1-fold (n = 4) when the complex was treated with alkaline phosphatase for 30 min at 37 °C and then incubated on ice 30 min with m"

However, a functional link between PKD1 and the ion transport processes required to drive renal cyst enlargement has remained elusive. We report here that expression at the Xenopus oocyte surface of a transmembrane fusion protein encoding the C-terminal portion of the PKD1 cytoplasmic tail, PKD1(115–226), but not the N-terminal portion, induced a large, Ca2+-permeable cation current, which shifted oocyte reversal potential (E rev) by +33 mV. Whole cell currents were sensitive to inhibition by La3+, Gd3+, and Zn2+, and partially inhibited by SKF96365 and amiloride. Currents were not activated by bath hypertonicity, but were inhibited by acid pH.

PKD1(115–226)-injected oocytes also exhibited elevated NP o of unitary calcium currents in outside-out and cell-attached patches, and elevated calcium permeability documented by fluorescence ratio and45Ca2+ flux experiments. Both Ca2+conductance and influx were inhibited by La3+. Mutation of candidate phosphorylation sites within PKD1(115–226) abolished the cation current. We conclude that the C-terminal cytoplasmic tail of PKD1 up-regulates inward current that includes a major contribution from Ca2+-permeable nonspecific cation channels. Dysregulation of these or similar channels in autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease may contribute to cyst formation or expansion. The cytoplasmic C-terminal portion of the polycystin-1 polypeptide (PKD1(1–226)) regulates several important cell signaling pathways, and its deletion suffices to cause autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease. However, a functional link between PKD1 and the ion transport processes required to drive renal cyst enlargement has remained elusive. We report here that expression at the Xenopus oocyte surface of a transmembrane fusion protein encoding the C-terminal portion of the PKD1 cytoplasmic tail, PKD1(115–226), but not the N-terminal portion, induced a large, Ca2+-permeable cation current, which shifted oocyte reversal potential (E rev) by +33 mV. Whole cell currents were sensitive to inhibition by La3+, Gd3+, and Zn2+, and partially inhibited by SKF96365 and amiloride. Currents were not activated by bath hypertonicity, but were inhibited by acid pH.

Cyst expansion is associated with the conversion of tubular epithelial cells from the normal phenotype of net solute reabsorption to the cystic phenotype of net secretion.

The varied signaling and binding functions of the PKD1 C-terminal cytoplasmic tail led us to hypothesize that it might regulate ion transport processes that mediate or regulate cyst expansion. We now report that the distal fragment of the cytoplasmic C-terminal tail of PKD1 (PKD1(115–226)), expressed as a transmembrane fusion protein, up-regulates inward current and a Ca2+-permeable nonspecific cation channel of Xenopus oocytes. cDNAs encoded tripartite fusion proteins in which the N-terminal extracellular domain of human CD16 was fused to the human CD7 transmembrane region (27Romeo C. Amiot M. Seed B. Cell. 1992; 68: 889-897Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar), whose cytoplasmic terminus was fused in turn to portions of the 226-amino acid (aa) C-terminal cytoplasmic domain of the 4303-aa human PKD1 polypeptide. These fusion proteins were subcloned in the oocyte expression vector, pXT7. The longest construct encoded the complete C-terminal cytoplasmic fragment of PKD1 (PKD1 aa 4078–4303), and was termed “CD16.7-PKD1-(1–226)” (12Arnould T.E. Kim E. Tsokias L. Jochimsen F. Gruning W.

One form added a single C-terminal Ser residue. The other form added the 7-residue C-terminal sequence Ser-Ala-Ala-Ala-Arg-Glu-Ile. Both of these fusion proteins were expressed at the oocyte surface, but neither increased oocyte currents. The experiment shown in Fig. 6 D utilized a form of CD16.7-PKD(1–92) devoid of any C-terminal extension. Other PKD1 constructs studied included “CD16.7-PKD1(1–155)” encoding PKD1 aa 4078–4232, “CD16.7-PKD1(115–189)” encoding PKD1 aa 4192–4266, and “CD16.7-PKD1(115–203)” encoding PKD1 aa 4192–4280. “CD16.7 control” encoded a cytoplasmic tail polypeptide of the same length as PKD1(1–92), but of unrelated, novel sequence. 3The construct CD16.7 control provides a novel, PKD1(1–92)-unrelated cytoplasmic C-terminal amino acid sequence of the same length as PKD1(1–92).

Point mutations in CD16.7-PKD1(115–226) were constructed by four primer polymerase chain reaction techniques. Primer sequences are available upon request. Integrity of the polymerase chain reaction products and of ligation junctions was confirmed by DNA sequencing. Sal I- orNot I-linearized recombinant pXT7 templates were transcribed with T7 RNA polymerase. Xenopus oocyte isolation, culture, and microinjection were performed using standard techniques (28Chernova M. Jiang L. Crest M. Hand M. Vandorpe D.H. Strange K. Alper S.L. J. Gen.

Oocytes injected with 12–25 ng of cRNA in a volume of 50 nl maintained integrity up to 18 days after injection. Generally, however, oocytes were subjected to electrical recording studies 2–3 days after microinjection. Oocytes injected 3, 5, or 10 days previously with cRNA were incubated with purified 3G8 mouse anti-human CD16 monoclonal antibody (gift of O. Mandelstam, J. Strominger, and J. Unkeless; or purchased from Meditech) at a concentration of 2 μg/ml in ND96 at room temperature for 3–4 h, then rinsed several times in ND96. Oocytes were fixed either in absolute methanol or in 3% paraformaldehyde in 140 mm NaCl, 20 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.4 (PBS). Paraformaldehyde-fixed oocytes were rinsed in PBS, quenched with several washes in PBS plus 50 mmglycine, then in PBS. Methanol-fixed oocytes were rehydrated into PBS. Oocytes were then incubated in secondary Cy3-conjugated donkey anti-mouse IgG (Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratories, West Grove, PA) diluted 1/500 in PBS, rinsed several times in PBS, then dehydrated in methanol, and cleared in benzyl benzoate/benzyl alcohol (2:1) prior to imaging with a Bio-Rad MRC 1024 confocal microscope. Some oocytes were incubated with both primary and secondary antibody prior to fixation, with indistinguishable results. Oocytes were placed in a 1-ml chamber (model RC-11, Warner Instruments, Hamden, CT) on the stage of a dissecting microscope and impaled with microelectrodes under direct view. Electrodes were pulled from borosilicate glass with a Narashige puller, filled with 3 m KCl, and had resistances of 2–3 megohms. Currents were measured with a Geneclamp 500 amplifier (Axon Instruments, Burlingame, CA) interfaced to a Hewlett Packard computer with a Digidata 1200 interface (Axon Instruments). Data acquisition and analysis utilized pCLAMP 6.0.3 software (Axon Instruments). Voltage pulse protocols consisting of 720-ms 20-mV steps between −100 and +20 mV were generated by the Clampex subroutine. Bath resistance was minimized by the use of agar bridges filled with 3 m KCl, and a virtual ground circuit clamped bath potential to zero. Standard bath solution was 96 mm NaCl, 2 mmKCl, 5 mm HEPES, 1.8 mm CaCl2, and 1 mm MgCl2, and holding potential was −30 mV. All solutions were of pH 7.40. Cation/anion permeability determinations were by equimolar replacement of bath Na+ withN-methyl-d-glucamine (NMDG), and of bath Cl− with gluconate. Determination of relative monovalent cation permeabilities was by equimolar substitution of bath Na+ with K+, Li+, and NH4−. Patch pipettes were pulled to a resistance of 5–8 megohms, and oocytes were devitellinized as described previously (29Vandorpe D.H. Shmukler B.E. Jiang L. Lim B. Maylie J. Adelman J.P. Francheschi L.

Gigaseals were first attained in the cell-attached mode. Outside-out patches were formed by breaking the oocyte plasma membrane with a pulse and withdrawing the pipette slowly. Currents were measured with an Axopatch 1D amplifier (Axon Instruments) interfaced via a Digidata 1200 AD/DA board to a HP Vectra computer. Data was acquired at 1 kHz and digitized at 5 kHz. For outside-out experiments, pipette solutions contained 128 mmcesium aspartate, 12 mm cesium EGTA, and 10 mmHEPES and the bath solution was 140 mm sodium methanesulfonate, 10 mm HEDTA, 10 mm HEPES. In cell-attached experiments, the pipette contained 100 mmCaCl2, 10 mm HEPES, and 10 mmHEDTA. Oocytes from both groups were injected with 70-kDa Calcium Green dextran (Molecular Probes) to a final concentration of 3.5–7 μm, then subjected to bath [Ca2+] change from 0 to 10 mm. Relative change in intracellular calcium concentration ([Ca2+]i) was determined by exciting the fluorophore at 490 nm and imaging at 530 nm as described (29Vandorpe D.H. Shmukler B.E. Jiang L. Lim B.

Additional oocytes were loaded for 45 min with 8 μmFura2-AM, then subjected to bath [Ca2+] changes from 1.8 mm to nominal 0 mm to 10 mm. In these oocytes [Ca2+]i was determined by alternately exciting the fluorophore at 340 and 380 nm. 510-nm emission images were acquired and analyzed as described (29Vandorpe D.H. Shmukler B.E. Jiang L. Lim B. Maylie J. Adelman J.P. Francheschi L. Cappellini M.D. Brugnara C. Alper S.L. J. Biol.

The uptake procedure was as reported (30Chen X.Z. Vassilev P. Basora N. Peng J. Nomura H. Segal Y. Brown E. Reeders S.T. Hediger M. Zhou J.

Oocytes were incubated 1 h in ND-96 modified to contain 0.13 mmCaCl2 with 2.5 μCi/μl 45Ca2+, washed in ND-96, then counted in a liquid scintillation counter (Packard 2200CA). Expression in Xenopus oocytes of CD16.7-PKD1(115–226) was associated with an inward current not observed in oocytes expressing CD16.7 control (Fig.1, A and B). The current measured at −100 mV in the CD16.7-PKD1(115–226) group was −910 ± 68 nA (n = 97 oocytes from 18 frogs) compared with −131 ± 11 nA in the CD16.7 control group (n = 79 oocytes from 15 frogs, t = 10.2, p < 0.0001 by unpaired two-tailed t test, Fig. 1 C). The average conductances of 2.1 and 8.7 μS and the whole cell reversal potentials (E rev) of −31 mV and +2 mV in oocytes expressing CD16.7 control and CD16.7-PKD1(115–226), respectively (Fig. 1 C), each differed significantly by unpaired t tests (p < 0.0001). The currents in CD16.7 control-expressing oocytes were indistinguishable from those measured in oocytes previously injected with CD16.7-PKD1(1–92) cRNA or with water (Fig. 1 D). Several subdomains of the PKD1 cytoplasmic C-terminal tail as CD16.7-PKD1 fusion proteins were expressed in oocytes further to delimit the regions required for activation of cation currents (Fig.1 D), which were sensitive to block by La3+(inset). La3+-sensitive inward currents elicited at −100 mV in oocytes expressing CD16.7-PKD1(115–203) or -(115–189) were of magnitude comparable to those observed with CD16.7-PKD1(115–226) (Fig. 1 D and data not shown) with CD16.7-PKD1(1–226). In contrast, expression of CD16.7 control, or of CD16.7-PKD1(1–92), (), or () did not induce such currents. Expression of the constructs shown in Fig. 1 D was not associated with evident oocyte morbidity over at least 4 days after cRNA injection. The increased inward current and positive voltage-shiftedE rev elicited by CD16.7-PKD1(115–226) but not by CD16.7 control was not explained by differences in oocyte surface expression of the different fusion proteins. As shown in Fig.2, immunostaining of intact, unfixed oocytes with anti-CD16 antibody revealed comparable intensities of CD16 signal at the oocyte surface whether the epitope was borne on CD16.7-PKD1(115–226) or by CD16.7 control. Surface staining intensity increased at longer times after cRNA injection and in oocytes coexpressing both cRNAs (data not shown). The inactive CD16.7-PKD1(1–92) constructs were also expressed at the surface of 57% of injected oocytes at fluorescence intensities comparable to that of the active construct CD16.7-PKD1(115–226). Surface staining was always absent in water-injected oocytes (data not shown) and in oocytes expressing CFTR, which lacks the CD16 epitope (Fig. 2 d). The ion selectivity of the CD16.7-PKD1(115–226)-associated current was tested by NaCl bath substitution with either sodium gluconate orN-methyl-d-glucamine chloride. Bath change from NaCl to sodium gluconate produced little reduction in current and no change in E rev (−1 ± 1 mV,n = 15, Fig.3 A). In contrast, bath change from NaCl to N-methyl-d-glucamine chloride significantly decreased inward current at −100 mV from −573 ± 58 nA to −327 ± 52 nA, p < 0.001), and hyperpolarized E rev −19 ± 5 mV (n = 15), each significantly greater than the −5 ± 1 mV hyperpolarization (p < 0.001,n = 5, unpaired t test), and −99 ± 13 nA inward current at −100 mV (p = 0.0019,n = 5) observed in oocytes expressing CD16.7(control). In the presence of the impermeant cation NMDG, the depolarizedE rev of CD16.7-PKD1(115–226)-expressing oocytes shifts toward the equilibrium potentials for Cl− and K+. These results are most simply explained by preferential activation of a cation conductance. The relative anion/cation permeability of oocytes expressing CD16.7-PKD1(115–226) was further tested by a mannitol dilution test. Shifting from 96 mm NaCl to a bath containing 9.6 mm NaCl, with mannitol added to maintain constant osmotic strength, decreased inward current at −100 mV from −634 ± 155 to −464 ± 130 nA (t = 5.5,p = 0.0009, by two-tailed t test), and hyperpolarized E rev from −11 ± 4 mV to −19 ± 6 mV (t = 4.1, p = 0.005, by paired t test). The direction of this shift inE rev indicates that CD16.7-PKD1(115–226)-stimulated current was more selective for cations than for anions. Oocytes were then ∼90% depleted of intracellular chloride by overnight incubation in a Cl-free sodium methanesulfonate medium (31Hasegawa H. Skach W. Baker O. Calayag M. Ligappa V. Verkman A.S. Science. 1992; 258: 1477-1479Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Following subsequent acute injection with EGTA to minimize residual Ca2+-activated Cl− currents, oocytes expressing CD16.7-PKD1(115–226) continued to exhibit La3+-sensitive current (Fig. 3 B) significantly greater than that observed in PKD1(1–92)fs-expressing oocytes. Monovalent cation selectivity of the induced current was tested by equimolar substitution of bath NaCl with KCl, LiCl, and NH4Cl. Bath substitution with KCl or LiCl depolarizedE rev by +15 ± 3 mV and +7 ± 3 mV, respectively (n = 5), in oocytes expressing CD16.7 control, as expected for the moderate K+ conductance and small cation conductance native to oocytes (32Busch A.E.

In contrast, these bath changes did not alter E rev in oocytes expressing CD16.7-PKD1(115–226). Whereas bath substitution with NH4Cl depolarized E rev in CD16.7 control-expressing oocytes by +41 ± 4 mV and significantly increased conductance (n = 5, data not shown) as in native oocytes (32Busch A.E. Kopp H.G. Waldegger S. Samarzija I. Subbrich H. Raber G. Kunzelmann K. Ruppersberg J.P. Lang F. J. Physiol. 1996; 491: 735-741Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), CD16.7-PKD1(115–226)-expressing oocytes shifted the (extrapolated) E rev only slightly, +6 ± 3 mV (n = 6; F = 5.7,p = 0.02, data not shown). Thus, CD16.7-PKD1(115–226)-associated currents exhibited little specificity among monovalent cations, and approximated in magnitude the native NH4+ conductance of oocytes (33Burckhardt B. Burckhardt G. Pflugers Arch. 1997; 434: 306-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The hypothesis that the PKD1(115–226)-associated current might conduct Ca2+ was tested by subjecting oocytes to voltage ramps first in the absence and then in the presence of 10 mm bath Ca2+ (Fig.4 A). The difference current at −100 mV attributable to Ca2+ was −436 ± 95 nA in CD16.7-PKD1(115–226)-expressing oocytes compared with +21 ± 27 nA in oocytes previously injected with water (p = 0.004, two-tailed t test). Thus, the nonspecific cation current activated in oocytes by expression of PKD1(115–226) also exhibited substantial permeability to Ca2+. The time course of holding currents was studied with calcium bath substitution (see Fig. 4 B). The holding potential chosen was −30 mV, close to the chloride equilibrium potential, to minimize potential contribution of endogenous chloride currents.

Iodothyronine substrate specificity is determined by amino acids located between residues 40 and 65, as judged by site-directed mutagenesis, analysis of species-specific differences in catalytic properties, and amino acid composition, and by interspecies deletion-substitution analysis (9Toyoda N.

Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 213-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). In addition to the presumed membrane anchor and the substrate specificity domain, the active center is thought to be located in an ∼15 amino acid long region bracketing the SeC residue (7Berry M.J.

The roles of Phe-65 in iodothyronine specificity and of SeC126 in catalysis are well established (7Berry M.J. Kieffer J.D. Harney J.W. Larsen P.R. J. Biol.

Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 213-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), whereas the roles of Cys-124 and His-174 in the catalytic reaction are less understood. For example, replacement of Cys-124 with alanine led to parallel ∼2-fold decreases in the K m for rT3 and in catalytic efficiency when assayed at a fixed cofactor concentration (15Sun B.C. Harney J.W. Berry M.J. Larsen P.R. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 5452-5458Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Determination of the limiting Michaelis constants using two substrate reaction kinetics revealed that theK m for rT3 was marginally affected in the C124A mutant (14Croteau W. Bodwell J.E.

Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 5452-5458Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), and the thiol cofactor requirement increased by 6–14-fold (14Croteau W. Bodwell J.E. Richardson J.M. St Germain D.L. J.

Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 5452-5458Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The mechanism for these changes in kinetic parameters is unclear. Traditional chemical modification studies established that histidine(s) were essential for catalysis (16Mol J.A. Docter R. Hennemann G. Visser T.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1984; 120: 28-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar,17Goswami A. Rosenberg I.N. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1990; 173: 6-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar), and subsequent mutagenesis and transient expression studies identified His-174 as one of these essential residue(s) (13Berry M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 18055-18059Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).However, caution is essential when attempting to assign functional significance to individual amino acids in an incompletely characterized enzyme. Whereas the direct participation of any D1 residue that affects catalysis is the first possibility often considered, it is equally likely that individual amino acid substitutions can influence D1 activity by indirect means such as (i) abnormal post-translational processing; (ii) altered folding of the primary translation product that leads to rapid degradation; (iii) improper sorting of the mutant p27 in the Golgi apparatus; and/or (iv) disturbed assembly of a functional enzyme. Thus, the interpretation of the mechanistic consequences of individual mutations on D1 activity in whole cell lysates of transiently transfected cells is difficult at best and cannot identify what molecular events are affected without an understanding of the influence of the mutation on enzyme assembly and processing.Much of the biochemistry of D1 was established prior to the cloning of the enzyme using the alkylating substrate analogs, N-BrAcT4and N-BrAcT3 (18Mol J.A.

Affinity labeling studies done with liver and kidney membrane preparations identified an ∼27-kDa thyroid hormone-binding protein (p27) (19Köhrle J. Rasmussen U.B. Ekenbarger D.M. Alex S. Rokos H.

Endocrinology. 1990; 126: 826-831Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) that was subsequently cloned by functional expression (5Berry M.J. Banu L. Larsen P.R. Nature. 1991; 349: 438-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (749) Google Scholar). Interestingly, molecular sieve chromatography of the detergent-soluble rat kidney D1 yielded an ∼50-kDa functional enzyme (22Leonard J.L. Rosenberg I.N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1981; 659: 205-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), and subsequent work showed that the affinity labeled p27 co-migrated with catalytic activity as an ∼54-kDa complex (23Leonard J.L. Ekenbarger D.M. Frank S.J. Farwell A.P. Koehrle J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 11262-11269Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These data suggested that the catalytically active D1 was composed of two similarly sized subunits. Whether the functional enzyme is a homodimer of p27 subunits or a heterodimer formed between p27 and an unknown subunit remains to be established. The latter possibility cannot be excluded because kidney-derived cell lines have been used for most, if not all, p27 transient expression studies, and this organ has abundant D1 activity. Thus, it is possible that a 25–30-kDa membrane anchor protein found in kidney cells could partner with p27 to form a functional enzyme.In this study, we exploited the species differences in the composition of the C terminus of p27 to characterize the composition of catalytically active D1. By using the native D1 found in a pig renal epithelial cell line (LLC-PK1), we overexpressed an immunologically unique, catalytically inert S126 mutant of rat p27 (M4), and we examined the consequences of M4 expression on D1 subunit assembly, enzyme activity, and subcellular trafficking. The data show that catalytically active D1 is a dimer composed of two p27 subunits and that the assembled enzyme is sorted to the basolateral plasma membrane of renal epithelial cells.DISCUSSIONThyroid hormone deiodination catalyzed by D1 generates most of the bioactive T3 found in the circulation and thereby plays a key role in the molecular mechanism of thyroid hormone action. Although the cloning of p27 yielded a catalytically active D1 after transient transfection (5Berry M.J. Banu L. Larsen P.R. Nature. 1991; 349: 438-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (749) Google Scholar), the subunit composition of the active enzyme, the role of individual p27 polypeptides in the catalytic reaction, and the physiochemical properties of the cloned enzyme have not been determined. In this report, we describe the subunit composition of catalytically active D1 holoenzyme, examine the role of each subunit in the deiodination reaction, and show that the D1 dimer is sorted to the basolateral plasma membrane of renal epithelial cells.Prior to the cloning of p27, affinity labeling studies done with alkylating derivatives of thyroxine were used to identify the D1 polypeptide(s). In both liver and kidney membrane preparations, a 27-kDa BrAcT4-labeled protein was identified, and this protein showed all of the properties of the substrate binding component of D1 as judged by rate inactivation studies (23Leonard J.L. Ekenbarger D.M. Frank S.J. Farwell A.P. Koehrle J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 11262-11269Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and inhibitor competition studies (19Köhrle J. Rasmussen U.B. Ekenbarger D.M. Alex S. Rokos H. Hesch R.D. Leonard J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 6155-6163Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Köhrle J. Rasmussen U.B. Rokos H. Leonard J.L. Hesch R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 6146-6154Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Subsequent work showed that the p27 polypeptide and the active D1 enzyme could not be separated by gel filtration and/or isopycnic density gradient centrifugation and that the molecular mass of the BrAcT4-labeled D1 was 54 kDa with an s 20,w of 3.7 S (28Safran M. Leonard J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 3233-3238Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), values similar to those determined earlier for a detergent-soluble D1 that required reactivation by lipid reconstitution (22Leonard J.L. Rosenberg I.N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1981; 659: 205-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). In contrast, detergent extracts of liver D1 that contained a catalytically active proteolipid complex showed a family of active enzyme(s) with much larger molecular weights after gel filtration (31Fekkes D. van Overmeeren E. Hennemann G. Visser T.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1980; 613: 41-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 32Fekkes D. Hennemann G. Visser T.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1983; 742: 324-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Thus, the constitution of the membrane-bound, functional D1 appeared to differ according to the detergent used and the tissue source.The finding that a catalytically active D1 enzyme assembles from an exogenous, inert p27 and a native p27 and that the hybrid enzyme had the same physiochemical properties as the native D1 directly confirms that D1 is a homodimer of p27 subunits. This is consistent with the earlier work (22Leonard J.L. Rosenberg I.N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1981; 659: 205-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 23Leonard J.L. Ekenbarger D.M. Frank S.J. Farwell A.P. Koehrle J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 11262-11269Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) that followed soluble D1 activity in crude membrane extracts. In addition, this observation shows that native and mutant p27 subunits can combine to constitute a hybrid enzyme and reveals that D1 assembly is a post-translational event that presumably depends upon the local concentration of p27 in the membrane. Since overexpression of an exogenous p27 mutant drives the native p27 subunit into hybrid D1 molecules, it appears that both the assembly and the composition of the D1 holoenzyme can be predetermined by experimental manipulation.Assembly of a functional D1 holoenzyme not only requires sufficient numbers of p27 subunits but also the correct positioning of yet to be identified dimerization domain(s). Importantly, the orientation of the native p27wt subunits in the D1 holoenzyme is constrained to a head-to-head, tail-to-tail orientation by the polarity of the membrane-bound p27 subunits and the sidedness of the catalytic activity (23Leonard J.L.

Arvan P. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 1247-1256PubMed Google Scholar). This limiting constraint imposed by the membrane-bound nature of p27 led Larsen and co-workers (10Toyoda N. Berry M.J. Harney J.W. Larsen P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12310-12318Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) to conclude that residues within the p27 membrane anchor directed either the proper folding of the p27 or participated in catalysis. Their conclusions were based, in part, on the failure of several p27 mutants to generate D1 activity after transient transfection when the membrane anchor of p27 was swapped with the endoplasmic reticulum-derived membrane anchor(s) from the bovine 21-hydroxylase P450 enzyme (10Toyoda N. Berry M.J. Harney J.W. Larsen P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12310-12318Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The results detailed in Fig. 7 clearly show that truncated p27 subunits lacking the membrane anchor will bind to the native p27 and produce a functional D1 holoenzyme in which only one p27 subunit is anchored to the membrane. These findings indicate that the assembly of the D1 holoenzyme is independent of the membrane anchor. Thus, the failure of the membrane anchor swapped p27s to assemble into a functional enzyme (10Toyoda N. Berry M.J. Harney J.W. Larsen P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12310-12318Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) is likely due to the low abundance of the exogenous p27 selenoprotein translation products after transient transfection and/or to directional miscues given by the endoplasmic reticulum resident P450-derived membrane anchor. Similar caveats apply to the failure of the p27 mutants in which the membrane anchor derived from the deiodinase family member, type III iodothyronine 5′-deiodinase, was substituted for the native membrane-spanning region to generate catalytically active enzyme (10Toyoda N. Berry M.J. Harney J.W. Larsen P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12310-12318Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Since loss of the membrane anchor from one p27 subunit yields a hybrid D1 with activity levels similar to that found when both enzyme subunits are membrane-bound, it is likely that a catalytically active, “soluble” D1 holoenzyme would assemble if sufficient quantities of truncated p27 selenoprotein subunits could be produced. Unfortunately, the limiting quantity of SeC in mammalian cells is likely to interfere with the synthesis of sufficient quantities of soluble p27 selenoprotein necessary to drive assembly of a soluble D1 holoenzyme.With the composition of the catalytically active D1 holoenzyme established, it is now possible to revisit the role of individual amino acids in the catalytic reaction and in enzyme assembly. For example, whereas site-directed mutagenesis was used to identify both the SeC and His as essential enzyme residues, these data did little to extend earlier work using more traditional approaches of chemical modification (16Mol J.A. Docter R. Hennemann G. Visser T.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1984; 120: 28-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 18Mol J.A. Docter R. Kaptein E. Jansen G. Hennemann G. Visser T.J.

Hennemann G. Visser T.J. FEBS Lett. 1982; 137: 40-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). In fact, among the histidine residues present in p27, D1 activity was completely lost by mutations of His-158 barring further analysis of this essential residue (13Berry M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 18055-18059Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Examination of the primary amino acid sequence of p27 reveals that this residue is located in the middle of an ∼15-residue long stretch found in all deiodinase family members from frog to man. With the ability to predetermine the composition of D1 holoenzyme, the influence of His-158 and His-174 on catalysis and on enzyme assembly can now be directly evaluated.The ability to drive a native, catalytically active p27 subunit into partnership with an inert p27 mutant allowed us to evaluate the catalytic reaction in a D1 holoenzyme in which only one partner is functional. By using steady-state reaction kinetics, we found that the hybrid D1 holoenzyme had little, if any, change in substrate affinities but showed a 75% decrease in the molar activity compared with wild type D1 dimer. Whether this decrease in activity reflects an interaction between the inert subunit and the native p27 that lowers the intrinsic catalytic potential of the native p27 or indicates that each p27 subunit in the D1 holoenzyme can serve as a catalytic center remains to be established.Based on the degeneracy of the C terminus of p27, we generated an inert p27GFP fusion protein that could be followed in the living cell. Addition of this relatively large epitope did not affect the ability of the fusion protein (M4GFP) to partner with the wild type p27 in LLC-PK1 cells, and the fluorescent D1 holoenzyme showed the same catalytic properties as that for D1 holoenzyme composed of M4 and p27wt subunits. Assuming the same stoichiometry of p27GFP fusion protein and p27wt as described in Table I, then ∼10% of the florescent D1 dimers were composed of an inert and active subunit, whereas 90% of the dimers formed were composed of two fluorescent and inert p27s. Analysis of the subcellular distribution of fluorescent D1 dimers revealed that the D1 dimers were sorted to the basolateral membranes of the oriented renal epithelial cell (23Leonard J.L.

Arvan P. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 1247-1256PubMed Google Scholar).In conclusion, the data show that catalytically active D1 is a homodimer of p27 subunits and that hybrid enzyme with only one active subunit can catalyze deiodination by a ping-pong reaction mechanism. Although the membrane anchor located in the N terminus of p27 constrains the assembly of the D1 subunits into a head-to-head and tail-to-tail orientation, p27 dimerization does not require the membrane anchor, and enzyme assembly is a post-translational event that appears to be driven by the local concentrations of enzyme subunits. Once assembled the D1 holoenzyme is sorted to the plasma membrane in both kidney and liver cells, where it can serve as an enzymic barrier to the entry of the prohormone T4 and the source of bioactive T3 for the cell. Type I thyroxine deiodinase (D1,1 EC 3.8.1.4) is the most abundant member of a family of membrane-bound enzymes that catalyze the removal of a single iodine atom from thyroid hormone. D1 generates most of the bioactive T3 found in blood (1Larsen P.R. Berry M.J. Thyroid. 1994; 4: 357-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar, 2Leonard J.L. Visser T.J. Hennemann G.

D1 is a selenoenzyme encoded by an ∼2.1-kilobase pair mRNA and is most abundant in liver, kidney, and thyroid (1Larsen P.R. Berry M.J.

The ∼27-kDa enzyme polypeptide (p27) contains the novel amino acid, selenocysteine (SeC) (5Berry M.J. Banu L. Larsen P.R. Nature. 1991; 349: 438-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (749) Google Scholar), and this residue is essential for full catalytic activity (6Behne D. Kyriakopoulos A. Meinhold H. Köhrle J. Biochem. Biophys.

Whether p27 is catalytically active itself or requires post-translational modification and/or assembly into a multimeric complex remains to be established.

To further understand the regulation of PLC-β2 by G proteins and the functional roles of PLC-β2 structural domains, we tested whether the separately expressed amino and carboxyl halves of PLC-β2could associate to form catalytically active enzymes as two polypeptides, and we explored how the complexes thus formed would be regulated by G protein βγ subunits (Gβγ). We expressed cDNA constructs encoding PLC-β2 fragments of different lengths in COS-7 cells and demonstrated by coimmunoprecipitation that the coexpressed fragments could assemble and functionally reconstitute an active PLC-β2. The pleckstrin homology domain of PLC-β2 was required for its targeting to the membrane and for substrate hydrolysis. Reconstituted enzymes that contained the linker region that joins the two catalytic domains were as active or more active than the wild-type PLC-β2. When the linker region was removed, basal PLC-β2 enzymatic activity was increased further, suggesting that the linker region exerts an inhibitory effect on basal PLC-β2 activity. The reconstituted enzymes, like wild-type PLC-β2, were activated by Gβγ; when the C-terminal region was present in these constructs, they were also activated by Gαq. Gβγ and Gαq activated these PLC-β2 constructs equally in the presence or absence of the linker region. We conclude that the linker region is an inhibitory element in PLC-β2and that Gβγ and Gαq do not stimulate PLC-β2 through easing the inhibition of enzymatic activity by the linker region.

IP3 releases Ca2+ from intracellular stores, and diacylglycerol activates protein kinase C (for review see Refs. 1Rana R.S. Hokin L.E. Physiol.

PLCs are importantly involved in multiple transmembrane signal transduction pathways that regulate numerous cellular processes (for review see Refs. 3Singer W.D. Brown H.A. Sternweis P.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 475-509Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar, 4Rhee S.G. Bae Y.S. J. Biol.

There are three families of PLC isoforms in mammals: β, γ, and δ. Each family includes more than one member (β, 1–4; γ, 1–2; and δ, 1–4). The activity of these different isoforms of PLC is controlled by different upstream regulators. PLC-βs are activated by G protein subunits Gβγ and Gαq/11 (6Exton J.H. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1997; 400A: 3-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). PLC-γs are regulated by receptor or nonreceptor protein-tyrosine kinases and PIP3 (4Rhee S.G. Bae Y.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15045-15048Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (815) Google Scholar). PLC-δs are regulated by a GTP-binding protein transglutaminase (7Feng J.-F. Rhee S.G. Im M.-J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16451-16454Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). PLC-δs are also more sensitive to Ca2+ than the other isozymes and, unlike PLC-γs and PLC-βs, are activated by Ca2+alone (8Allen V. Swigart P. Cheung R. Cockroft S. Katan M. Biochem. J. 1997; 327: 545-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). All the ten mammalian PLC isozymes identified to date are modular proteins. As shown in Fig. 1, the PLCs contain a pleckstrin homology (PH) domain, four EF-hand motifs, a catalytic domain (composed of X and Y regions separated by a linker region) and a C2 domain. PLC-βs have an additional 400-residue C-terminal region, which is required for activation by Gαq (9Wu D. Jiang H. Katz A. Simon M.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3704-3709Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Park D. Jhon D.-Y. Lee C.-W. Ryu S.H. Rhee S.G. J. Biol.

Chem. 1996; 271: 21187-21192Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Among the PLC isozymes, only members of the PLC-β family (PLC-β1–3) are activated by Gβγ. Part of the Gβγ-binding site on PLC-β2 is located in the Y region as shown by cross-linking (12Sankaran B. Osterhout J. Wu D. Smrcka A.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7148-7154Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) and copurification (13Kuang Y. Wu Y. Smrcka A. Jiang H. Wu D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 2964-2968Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Gβγ can also bind to the isolated PH domains from PLC-β2 (14Wang T. Pentyala S. Rebecchi M.J. Scarlata S. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 1517-1524Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Indirect evidence suggests that this interaction may lead to activation of PLC-β2 (15Wang T. Dowal L. El-Maghrabi M.R. Rebecchi M. Scarlata S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7466-7469Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Despite these progresses, the mechanism whereby Gβγ activates PLC-β2 is still unclear. It seems unlikely that PLC-β2 activation by Gβγ involves membrane translocation of PLC-β2 to the plasma membrane, because Gβγ does not significantly alter the binding affinity of PLC-β2 to phospholipid vesicles (16Romoser V. Ball R. Smrcka A.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25071-25078Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 17Runnels L.W. Jenco J. Morris A. Scarlata S.

The goal of this study was to further understand the mechanism of substrate hydrolysis of PLC-β2, its regulation by G protein subunits, and the functional contribution of some of the PLC-β2 domains to enzyme function. Although some PLC domains are homologous to known domains in other proteins, and highly homologous domains can be found among the various PLC isoforms, these domains may have different functions in the different isoforms. For example, PH domains are found in many proteins, but only some of them can bind WD-repeat-containing proteins (such as Gβγ) (for review see Ref. 19Rebecchi M.J. Scarlata S. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Struct. 1998; 27: 503-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). In addition, the PH domains of various PLC isoforms show very different affinities to phospholipids (14Wang T. Pentyala S. Rebecchi M.J. Scarlata S. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 1517-1524Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 20Garcia P. Gupta R. Shah S. Morris A.J. Rudge S.A. Scarlata S. Petrova V. Mclaughlin S.

EMBO J. 1998; 17: 414-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar). It is therefore necessary to test individual proteins to find out which role(s) a particular domain plays in a particular context. The roles of other specific PLC domains in basal and ligand-regulated PLC catalytic activities have not yet been clearly identified. For example, the role of the linker region between X and Y regions of the catalytic domain is less well understood. In the crystal structure of the PLC-δ1 molecule, the X and Y regions are tightly associated to form a triose phosphate isomerase barrel-like structure (22Essen L.-O. Perisic O. Cheung R. Katan M. Williams R.L. Nature. 1996; 380: 595-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar). Although the X and Y regions are well conserved among the PLC isozymes, the linker region possesses little similarity among the PLC isozymes. For example, PLC-γs have a long linker region that contains two SH2 domains, one SH3 domain, and an additional PH domain, whereas the linker regions in PLC-β and PLC-δ are less than 100 residues long and contain no obvious structural domains within them. In the crystal structure of PLC-δ1, the linker region shows a disordered structure (22Essen L.-O. Perisic O. Cheung R. Katan M. Williams R.L. Nature. 1996; 380: 595-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar). The linker region is not essential for PLC catalytic activity. Coexpression of the N- and C-terminal fragments of PLC-γ1 lacking the linker region produces a catalytically active complex with an activity substantially higher than the holoenzyme (23Hortsman D.A. DeStefano K. Carpenter G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 7518-7521Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Trypsin digestion of PLC-δ1 cleaves the enzyme at the linker region and generates two associated fragments that retain catalytic activity (24Cifuentes M.E. Honkanen L. Rebecchi M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11586-11593Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Proteolysis at or near the linker region of a truncated form of PLC-β2 after it had folded into an active enzyme suggested that the linker region served as an inhibitory element (25Schnabel P. Camps M. Biochem. J. 1998; 330: 461-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). In this study, the linker region was cleaved but not removed and the exact site of tryptic or V8 protease cleavage was not determined. Because the authors used a truncated form of PLC-β2 that was not stimulated by Gαq, it was not possible to determine the effect of proteolysis of the enzyme in or near its linker region on Gαq-dependent PLC activity. It is usually straightforward to analyze the contributions of domains at the N or C termini of a protein, because truncated forms of the enzyme can be made, and these truncated proteins are often active. In addition to analyzing the role of the N-terminal PH domain and the C terminus, we were particularly interested in the linker region. Because it is often difficult to study the function of internal domains due to misfolding of proteins with internal deletions, we attempted to reconstitute PLC-β2 from two separate fragments, each containing one of the two catalytic X and Y regions. We tested whether or not the N- and C-terminal halves of PLC-β2 could associate to form catalytically active enzymes when expressed as two separate polypeptides and whether reconstituted PLC-β2could still be activated by Gβγ and Gαq. Using PLC fragments of different lengths, we examined the functional contribution of the PH domain, the linker region and the C-terminal region to basal activity and Gα- and Gβγ-mediated PLC-β2activation. Answers to these questions will expand our understanding of the mechanism of substrate hydrolysis by PLC-β2 and its regulation by G proteins. Plasmids containing cDNA sequences encoding various fragments of human PLC-β2 were constructed by polymerase chain reaction. Full-length wild-type PLC-β2 in pMT2 vector (a gift from M. Simon of the California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, CA) was used as template. The primer at the 5′-end included a HindIII site, a Kozak sequence (GCCGCC), and a start codon. The primer at the 3′-end included an EcoRI site and a stop codon. To add a FLAG or hemagglutinin (HA) epitope tag to a construct, one of the two primers contained the sequence encoding the epitope. The polymerase chain reaction products were digested with HindIII andEcoRI and cloned into anHindIII/EcoRI-cut pcDNA3 vector. All the sequences were confirmed by DNA sequencing. COS-7 cells were maintained in complete growth medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 50 units/ml penicillin, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin). Cells in 6-well plates (for immunoprecipitation) or 12-well plates (for PLC activity assay) were transfected using LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies). Prior to transfection, cells were transferred to Opti-MEM I medium (Life Technologies) for 1 h. The medium was replaced with 1 ml (6-well plates) or 500 μl (12-well plates) of Opti-MEM I containing preformed DNA-LipofectAMINE complexes. The final concentration of DNA in the medium was 1.5 or 2.5 μg/ml. The exact amount of each plasmid was as indicated in the legends to individual figures. The ratio (w/w) between DNA and LipofectAMINE was always kept at 1:8. After 5 h, 2 ml (6-well plates) or 500 μl (12-well plates) of complete growth medium were added to each well. The medium was replaced with complete growth medium the next day. Forty-eight hours after transfection, cells on 6-well plates were starved for 2 h in 2 ml of starvation medium (RPMI 1640 without glutamine, methionine, and cysteine (Sigma) supplemented with 10% dialyzed, heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum and 2 mml-glutamine). The cells were then metabolically labeled in 1 ml of starvation medium containing 150 μCi of [35S]-Express Protein Labeling Mix (NEN) for 4 h. The cells were rinsed with PBS and lysed in 1 ml of lysis buffer (50 mm HEPES-Na (pH 7.5), 6 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 75 mm sucrose, 3 mmbenzamidine, 1% (v/v) Triton X-100, and 1 mmdithiothreitol) at 4 °C for 30 min. The cell lysates were precleared with 30 μl of protein G-agarose (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) or 50 μl of protein A-Sepharose (Sigma) slurry (50% (v/v) in PBS) for 30 min. After a 10-min centrifugation, the supernatants were mixed with 2 μl of M2 anti-FLAG antibody (Sigma) or anti-HA-epitope antibody 12CA5 (Babco) at 4 °C overnight. The samples were centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 15 min. The supernatants were then mixed with 30 μl of protein G-agarose or 50 μl of protein A-Sepharose slurry for 1.5 h. The resins were washed twice at 4 °C for 15 min each with 1 ml of lysis buffer containing 150 mm NaCl and once at room temperature for 15 min with 1 ml of PBS. 25 μl of 3× sample buffer (187.5 mm Tris-Cl (pH 6.8), 6% SDS, 30% glycerol, 0.003% bromphenol blue) was added to each of the final pellets, and 20 μl was loaded onto an SDS-PAGE gel. The gel was Coomassie Blue-stained, destained, treated with EN3HANCE (NEN), dried, and used for autoradiography with intensifying screens at −80 °C. PLC activity was analyzed as production of inositol phosphates (26Li Y. Sternweis P.M. Charnecki S. Smith T.F. Gilman A.G. Neer E.J. Kozasa T. J. Biol.

Twenty-four hours after transfection, the medium was replaced with 1 ml of inositol-free DMEM supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum. Two hours later, the medium was again replaced with the same medium containing 2 μCi of myo-[3H]inositol. After 15 min, 10 μl of 1m LiCl was added to each well (the final LiCl concentration was 10 mm). No difference in the uptake/incorporation of myo-[3H]inositol was found in cells incubated with LiCl-containing medium for 1 h and 24 h. Forty-eight hours after transfection, the cells were washed with 1 ml of PBS and extracted twice for 30 min each with 500 μl of 20 mmformic acid. The extracts were combined and neutralized to pH 7.5 with a solution containing 7.5 mm HEPES and 150 mmKOH. The neutralized extracts were loaded onto 0.5 ml AG1-X8 (Bio-Rad) anion exchange columns. Prior to use, the columns were washed with 2 ml of 1 m NaOH and 2 ml of 1 m formic acid and equilibrated with H2O to neutrality. After the extracts were loaded onto the columns, the columns were washed with 5 ml of H2O and 5 ml of 5 mm Borax and 60 mm sodium formate. The inositol phosphates were eluted with 3 ml of 0.9 m ammonium formate and 0.1 m formic acid. The eluates were counted in a scintillation counter. COS-7 cells cultured in 6-well plates were transfected and metabolically labeled with [35S]-Express Protein Labeling Mix as described above. The cells were washed with PBS and detached by incubation in 500 μl of Trypsin-EDTA solution (1×) (Sigma) at 37 °C for 1 min. After mixing with 2 ml of DMEM/8% fetal bovine serum, the cells were collected by centrifugation at 500 × g at 4 °C for 5 min. After being washed with 3 ml of a buffer identical to the lysis buffer used in immunoprecipitation but containing no Triton X-100, the cells were resuspended in 600 μl of the same buffer and went through freeze-and-thaw in ethanol/dry ice three times (3 min per period). The broken cells were then passed trough a 23-gauge (or smaller) needle ten times to shear DNA and centrifuged at 100,000 × g in a Beckman SW55 rotor at 4 °C for 30 min. The supernatant was the soluble fraction. The pellet was resuspended in 600 μl of lysis buffer containing 1% Triton X-100 and incubated at 4 °C for 30 min. The supernatant, after a 5-min centrifugation at 15,000 ×g was the particulate fraction. Both the soluble and the particulate fractions were later used in immunoprecipitation. Forty-eight hours after transfection, cells in 6-well plates were washed with 2 ml of PBS and harvested in 1 ml of lysis buffer. The cells were lysed at 4 °C for 30 min. After a 10-min centrifugation at 15,000 × g, an aliquot (10 μl) of the supernatant was loaded on an SDS-PAGE mini-gel, and the resolved proteins were wet-electroblotted to a nitrocellulose membrane and probed with specific primary and peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies using a chemiluminescence kit according to the manufacturer's instructions (NEN). We constructed several mammalian expression plasmids encoding various fragments of PLC-β2, as shown in Fig. 1. To further understand the mechanism of substrate hydrolysis of PLC-β2 and its regulation by G protein subunits, we used these constructs to determine whether the amino and carboxyl halves of PLC-β2 could associate when expressed as two polypeptides and, if they could, how the complexes thus formed would be regulated by Gβγ and Gαq. These constructs were designed to allow us to test the role of the PH domain, to compare the activity and G protein regulation of enzyme with the linker region either attached to the C-terminal fragment or completely removed, and to compare the activity of reconstituted enzyme with and without the C-terminal domain required for activation by Gαq. To all these fragments (except construct A), a FLAG or an HA epitope tag-encoding sequence was attached at one end (see Fig. 1). Construct Ahad both a FLAG tag at the N terminus and an HA tag at the C terminus to compare the results of immunoprecipitation through the FLAG and HA tags. Antibodies directed against the epitope tags were used to (co)-immunoprecipitate metabolically labeled PLC-β2fragments that had been expressed in COS-7 cells. The representative autoradiograph in Fig. 2 Ashows that most of the fragments were robustly expressed. OnlyA and E fragments were expressed at significantly lower levels (about one-tenth to one-fifth) when compared with their corresponding PH domain-containing fragments (A′ fragment and wild-type, respectively). PLC-β2 has an endogenous proteolytic site that cleaves off the C-terminal region necessary for Gαq activation (10Park D. Jhon D.-Y. Lee C.-W. Ryu S.H. Rhee S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3710-3714Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The wild-type enzyme expressed in COS-7 cells was partially cleaved at this site giving rise to a fragment of about the same size as A′ fragment. The A′ fragment was further cleaved to a polypeptide of approximately the same size as theB′ fragment. Similarly, A and Efragments had shorter polypeptides of the same size as the Bfragment, suggesting that there is another proteolytic site near the C terminus of the X region. The remaining proteolytic or background bands were not identified but represented only a small fraction of the total protein. Lanes 8–11 of Fig. 2 A show that theB′ fragment could bind C, C′,D, and D′ fragments (C′ andD′ fragments lacked the linker region, whereas Cand D fragments included this region). The expression level of the B′ fragment was higher when the C-terminal fragments were coexpressed, suggesting that they stabilized the B′ fragment. Immunoprecipitation through the FLAG tag on the B′ fragment was able to coimmunoprecipitate the C,C′, D, and D′ fragments, indicating that the B′ fragment was able to form complexes with each. The B′ fragment coimmunoprecipitated approximately equal amounts of C and C′ fragments. The numbers of methionines in these fragments were: 15 in B′, 17 inC, 16 in C′, 27 in D, and 26 inD′. The D and D′ fragments were cleaved at or near the site described by Park et al. (10Park D. Jhon D.-Y. Lee C.-W. Ryu S.H. Rhee S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3710-3714Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) to generate C and C′ fragments, which also bound to the B′ fragment. About 90% of D fragment and 75% of D′ fragment were cleaved. The implication of this cleavage for interpretation of activity measurements will be described below. The B fragment, which lacked the PH domain, could also coimmunoprecipitate a C-terminal fragment (C,C′, D, and D′ fragments), but the capacity was lower when compared with the B′ fragment (Fig.2 B). Therefore, removal of the PH domain reduced but did not block assembly. Immunoprecipitation and coimmunoprecipitation could also be performed through the HA epitope tag on A,C, C′, D, and D′ fragments, but the efficiency was lower. For this reason, we performed the coimmunoprecipitation in all our other experiments through the FLAG epitope tag. We also examined whether the PLC-β2 fragments could form complexes after they had been synthesized. When the B′ fragment and C, C′, D, orD′ fragments were expressed in COS-7 cells separately and later mixed after cell lysis, none of the C, C′,D, nor D′ fragments were coimmunoprecipitated by the B′ fragment (data not shown). Therefore, the PLC-β2 fragments need to be coexpressed in cells to form complexes with one another. In addition, we failed to coimmunoprecipitate Gβ1γ2 through a FLAG tag on the PLC-β2 fragments (including the wild-type PLC-β2) or to coimmunoprecipitate the PLC-β2 fragments with Gβ1γ2through an HA tag on Gβ1 or Gγ2, suggesting that the interaction was weak. We next tested the catalytic activity of the PLC-β2 fragments measured as production of inositol phosphates. Full-length, wild-type PLC-β2 was used as control. As shown previously in this laboratory (26Li Y. Sternweis P.M. Charnecki S. Smith T.F. Gilman A.G. Neer E.J. Kozasa T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16265-16272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 27Panchenco M.P. Saxena K. Li Y. Charnecki S. Sternweis P.M. Smith T.F. Gilman A.G. Kozasa T. Neer E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28298-28304Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), inositol phosphate production increased when COS-7 cells were transfected with PLC-β2 itself (Fig.3 A). Coexpression of Gβ1γ2 caused a pronounced rise in PLC activity. PLC-β2 truncated at the C terminus (A′ fragment) had basal and Gβ1γ2-stimulated activity equal to the full-length enzyme. Even though the wild-type enzyme was substantially cleaved, if the activity of the wild-type enzyme was much higher thanA′ fragment, the mixture should still show higher activity than the A′ fragment. These results were consistent with previous reports (9Wu D. Jiang H. Katz A. Simon M.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3704-3709Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Park D. Jhon D.-Y. Lee C.-W.

Chem. 1993; 268: 25952-25957Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, when the PH domain was removed from the full-length or truncated enzyme (E fragment andA fragment, respectively), both were inactive. Fig.3 A also shows that individual fragments containing only one of the two catalytic regions (B, B′,C, C′, D, and D′) had no PLC activity whether or not the PH domain was present. Fig.3 B illustrates that basal and Gβ1γ2-stimulated PLC-β2activity could be reconstituted from two fragments each containing one of the catalytic domains only if the PH domain was present. The characteristics of the reconstituted activity will be discussed below. These results indicate that the PH domain was required for PLC-β2 to hydrolyze its substrate in COS-7 cells. Because the fragments and reconstituted complexes lacking the PH domain (i.e. E, A, and complexes formed with the B fragment) were expressed at levels significantly lower than those containing the PH domain (the wild-type enzyme,A′, and complexes formed with the B′ fragment) (Fig. 2), it was possible that their lower catalytic activity was simply a result of lower expression. To test this possibility, we compared the expression and PLC activity of B + C′ at a higher DNA dose (625 ng of DNA/ml at transfection) with those ofB′ + C′ transfected with one-tenth of this DNA dose (62.5 ng/ml). We chose this pair, because, in contrast to the wild-type enzyme and the A′ fragment, at the lower DNA doseB′ + C′ were expressed well and had a basal activity substantially higher than the blank. Despite a higher expression level of the B fragment (due to higher DNA dosage) compared with the B′ fragment and a similar amount of coimmunoprecipitated C′, B + C′ showed no enzymatic activity. Similar results were also observed for other fragments (data not shown). Although this experiment did not completely exclude the possibility that the absence of PLC activity ofE and A was in part due to low expression, our results indicated that removal of the PH domain abolished the function of PLC-β2 in COS-7 cells. Removal of the PH domain also altered the subcellular distribution of the expressed proteins (Fig. 4). When the PH domain was present (wild-type, A′, and B′ fragments), ∼30% of the enzyme was found in the particulate fraction. Constructs lacking the PH domain (E, A, and B fragments) were found almost exclusively in the soluble fraction. Therefore, the inaccessibility to a membrane-associated substrate may account for the observed loss of PLC-β2 activity in constructs lacking the PH domain. However, using these experimental approaches in transfected cells, we could not distinguish an intrinsic loss of catalytic activity in truncated fragments from effects secondary to alterations in subcellular localization. Gβγ needs to dissociate from Gα to interact with its effectors. Therefore, excess Gαi should block the Gβγ activation of PLC-β2 by scavenging free Gβγ to form heterotrimers (26Li Y. Sternweis P.M.

This is an important control, because it shows that Gβγ is activating PLC-β2 with characteristics expected for a heterotrimeric G protein. Fig.5 shows that, although Gαi1itself did not exhibit any significant effect in any group, it efficiently blocked Gβ1γ2 activation of reconstituted PLC-β2. The PLC activity dropped to a level equal to or slightly lower than the basal activity. Cotransfection of the COS-7 cells with plasmids encoding Gαi1 and/or Gβγ protein subunits had no effect on the amount of immunoprecipitated PLC-β2 fragments (data not shown). The above experiments showed that the N-terminal fragment containing the PH domain (B′ fragment) could reconstitute active enzyme when coexpressed with the C-terminal fragments. The reconstituted complexes had higher basal PLC activities than the wild-type PLC-β2 and, like the wild-type PLC-β2 and A′ fragment, were activated by Gβ1γ2 (Figs. 3 B and 5). Among the four complexes, those lacking the linker region (B′+ C′ and B′ + D′) had higher basal and Gβ1γ2-stimulated activity than those with the linker region connected to a C-terminal fragment (B′+ C and B′ + D). Although the reconstituted complexes had Gβ1γ2-stimulated activities that were equal to or greater than that of the wild-type enzyme, this was entirely due to increased basal activity. There was no significant change in the increment due to Gβ1γ2 between the wild-type enzyme and any mutant/complex but B′ + C, whose increase was higher than that of any other group. This indicates that, although cleavage or removal of the linker region leads to increased basal activity, it does not affect the activation of PLC-β2 by Gβ1γ2. PLC-βs are the only PLC isozymes that are activated by Gαq (9Wu D. Jiang H. Katz A. Simon M.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3704-3709Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 29Taylor S.J.

This activation involves the long C-terminal region characteristic of the PLC-β isozymes. We had shown above (Figs. 3 and 5) that the recombined PLC-β2 complexes could be activated by Gβ1γ2 and tested next whether they could also be activated by Gαq (Fig.6). We used the wild-type PLC-β2 and A′ fragments, which lacks the C-terminal region, as positive and negative controls, respectively. Among the four complexes, no significant activation by Gαq was observed in the combinations lacking the C-terminal region (B′ + C or B′+ C′). In contrast, B′ + D andB′ + D′ were activated by Gαq. As with Gβγ activation, the increment in PLC-β2 activity due to Gαq was very similar in wild-type PLC-β2, B′ + D and B′ +D′. Again, removal of the linker region (as in B′ + D′ and B′ + C′) increased the basal activity, but the basal activity and the Gαq-induced increase in activity were additive. These results documented that the reconstituted PLC-β2 complexes containing the C-terminal region were still subject to regulation by Gαq. We also tested the effect of Gαq on fragments and reconstituted enzymes without the PH domain (E, B + C′, andB + D′). These fragments or reconstituted proteins showed no increase in PLC activity, providing further evidence that removal of the PH domain abolished the function of PLC-β2 (Fig.6 B). Our study is the first to reconstitute active enzymes with PLC-β fragments. In this study, we have characterized several constructs encoding various fragments of human PLC-β2. We reassembled PLC-β2 from enzyme fragments each containing one of the two catalytic regions (Fig. 2) and found that the PH domain was required for both enzymatic activity (Figs. 3) and membrane targeting of PLC-β2 (Fig. 4). These reassembled enzymes were still subject to regulation by G protein subunits (Figs. 5 and 6). We identified the X-Y linker region as an inhibitory element in the intact enzyme. However, changes at the linker region did not affect the regulation of PLC-β2 by G protein subunits (Figs. 3, 5, and 6). We found that, although the targeting of PLC-β2 fragments lacking the PH domain to the membrane may be impaired (Fig. 4), these fragments were still assembled (Fig. 2). Moreover, the PH domain was essential for PLC-β2 to hydrolyze its substrates in COS-7 cells (Fig.3). We could not distinguish whether removal of the PH domain in PLC-β2 prevented the enzyme from getting access to its substrates in the plasma membrane, caused a loss in enzymatic activity, or both. A PLC-δ1 construct in which the PH domain was replaced by glutathione S-transferase has full enzymatic activity (32Ellis M.V. Carne S. Katan M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 213: 339-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), suggesting that the major role of the PH domain in PLC-δ1 is to ensure membrane localization. The PH domain of PLC-δ1 binds to the PIP2 polar headgroup with an affinity and specificity comparable to the native enzyme (20Garcia P. Gupta R. Shah S. Morris A.J. Rudge S.A. Scarlata S. Petrova V. Mclaughlin S. Rebecchi M.J. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 16228-16234Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar) and is proposed as the anchor localizing the enzyme to the plasma membrane in the “tether-and-fix” model based on the crystal structure of PLC-δ1 (22Essen L.-O. Perisic O. Cheung R. Katan M. Williams R.L. Nature. 1996; 380: 595-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar). The PH domain of PLC-γ1 binds to PIP3 strongly and specifically and targets the enzyme to the membrane in response to growth factor stimulation (21Falasca M. Logan S.K. Lehto V.P. Baccante G. Lemmon M.A. Schlessinger J. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 414-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar). In contrast, PLC-β1, PLC-β2 and their PH domains bind to phospholipid membrane surfaces with lower affinities, and the binding is PIP2concentration-independent (14Wang T. Pentyala S. Rebecchi M.J. Scarlata S. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 1517-1524Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). We observed that PLC-β2fragments lacking the PH domain were not found in the particulate fraction, whereas constructs containing the PH domain were partially targeted to the particulate fraction (Fig. 4). Therefore, this domain is also involved in membrane targeting of PLC-β2. Besides binding to some inositol phosphates, PH domains identified in some proteins bind to proteins containing WD-repeats (33Touhara K. Inglese J. Pitcher J.A. Shaw G. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10217-10220Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). An example is the strong interaction between β-adrenergic receptor kinase and Gβγ (34Pitcher J.A. Inglese J. Higgins J.B. Arriza J.L. Casey P.J. Kim C. Benovic J.L. Kwatra M.M. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Science. 1992; 257: 1264-1267Crossref PubMed Scopus (572) Google Scholar). The isolated PH domain of PLC-β2 binds to Gβγ with an affinity comparable to that of the full-length PLC-β2 (14Wang T. Pentyala S. Rebecchi M.J. Scarlata S. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 1517-1524Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), but the significance of this interaction for the enzyme's regulation by Gβγ needs to be further tested. The X and Y regions form the catalytic domain of PLC. In the present study, we demonstrated by coimmunoprecipitation experiments that, when COS-7 cells were cotransfected with two plasmids each containing the DNA sequence encoding one of the two catalytic regions, the two in vivocoexpressed fragments associated tightly with each other (Fig. 2). In contrast, fragments that were separately expressed and then combined could not bind to each other, suggesting that the association occurs during translation. The reassembled enzymes possessed catalytic activity similar to or higher than that of the wild-type PLC-β2 (Figs.3 B and 5). The most dramatic elevation of the basal catalytic activity was found in the two combinations lacking the linker region, B′ + C′ and B′ + D′. These results suggest that the linker region, when present in the intact enzyme, inhibits basal PLC-β2 activity. When the linker region was attached to the C-terminal fragment containing the Y domain, but (in contrast to wild-type PLC-β2) was not linked to the X domain, thereby allowing for more flexibility, the basal activity almost doubled (Figs. 3 B and 5, compare the wild-type PLC-β2 with B′ + D). However, the linker region may still interfere with PIP2hydrolysis, because complete removal of the linker region resulted in even greater increase in the basal activity. The long C-terminal region was not essential for the basal or Gβγ-stimulated activity of PLC-β2 (Fig.3 A). However, the highest basal activity of all was given byB′ + D′ that lacked the linker region but retained the long C-terminal domain. As was shown in Fig. 2, the C-terminal domain did not lead to the formation of more reassembled PLC-β2. Therefore, we conclude that the presence of the C-terminal domain allows those complexes that do reassemble to acquire a more active conformation. We found that even when the linker region was cleaved or completely removed, PLC-β2 was activated by Gβ1γ2 and this activation was completely blocked by Gαi1 (Fig. 5). These PLC-β2fragments were also subject to activation by Gαq. Consistent with previous findings (9Wu D. Jiang H. Katz A. Simon M.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3704-3709Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Park D. Jhon D.-Y. Lee C.-W. Ryu S.H. Rhee S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3710-3714Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), activation by Gαq was contingent upon the presence of the C-terminal region (Fig. 6). In addition, all PLC-β2 fragments showed similar increment in PLC-β2 activity upon activation by Gβ1γ2 or Gαq. Therefore, it is highly unlikely that the G protein αq and βγ subunits regulate PLC-β2 by direct effects on the linker region. Our experiments show that the PH domain is required for the basal as well as the Gαq- and Gβγ-stimulated PLC-β2 activity in a heterogeneous cell expression system. Like PLC-γ1, functional PLC-β2 can be reconstituted from two coexpressed enzyme fragments, each containing one of the two catalytic regions. The linker region is an inhibitory element in PLC-β2, but cleavage or removal of the linker region does not affect the G protein-mediated regulation of PLC-β2. Therefore, Gβγ and Gαq appear to activate PLC-β2 by mechanisms other than easing the inhibition of PLC-β2 activity by the linker region, thereby providing evidence for a regulatory pathway for PLC-β2-involving mechanisms distinct from other PLC isoforms."

This mode of p27Kip1degradation is mediated by the proteasome-dependent export of p27Kip1 from the nucleus and subsequent ubiquitination and degradation in the cytoplasm (28Tomoda K. Kubota Y.

In the frog, Xenopus laevis, two CDK2 inhibitors of the Cip/Kip family have been identified that exhibit homology to mammalian p27Kip1, p57Kip2, and p21Cip1. X enopus inhibitor ofCDK (p27Xic1 or Xic1) andkinase inhibitor from X enopus (p28Kix1 or Kix1) share ∼90% amino acid sequence identity with each other and preferentially inhibit the activity of CDK2-cyclin E (30Su J.Y.

Cell. 1996; 7: 457-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Xic1 and Kix1 also inhibit chromosomal nuclear DNA synthesis in interphase egg extracts and bind both CDK-cyclin complexes and proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) (30Su J.Y. Rempel R.E.

Cell. 1996; 7: 457-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Xic1 is degraded in Xenopus interphase egg extracts in a manner dependent on Cdc34, polyubiquitination, and the proteasome (32Yew P.R. Kirschner M.W. Science. 1997; 277: 1672-1676Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar,33Swanson C. Ross J. Jackson P.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 7796-7801Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the Cdc34-dependent degradation of Xic1 is only observed in the presence of nuclei and increasing amounts of nuclei result in progressively shorter half-lives of Xic1 (32Yew P.R. Kirschner M.W. Science. 1997; 277: 1672-1676Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The requirement for nuclei in ubiquitin-dependent degradation of Xic1 is intriguing, because mammalian p27Kip1 is readily ubiquitinated and degraded in whole cell extracts without the need for intact nuclei, whereas p21Cip1 is degraded in nuclei by the proteasome but without a need for ubiquitination (15Carrano A.C.

To better define the requirement for nuclei in Xic1 degradation, we use Xenopus interphase extracts and transport-competent nuclei to demonstrate that Xic1 ubiquitination and degradation require transport of Xic1 into the nucleus. We also identify the sequences of Xic1 that are required for efficient nuclear transport and show that nuclear localization is mediated by CDK2-cyclin E binding to Xic1 and Xic1 nuclear localization sequences (NLSs). We also show that binding to CDK2-cyclin E is dispensable for Xic1 ubiquitination and degradation in the nucleus. Finally, we demonstrate that the basic residues spanning amino acids 180–183 are critical for Xic1 degradation and ubiquitination. We propose that this region of Xic1 is essential for either binding the ubiquitin conjugation machinery or interacting with an alternate as yet unidentified regulatory protein. X. laevis egg interphase extract (low speed supernatant (LSS)) and demembranated sperm chromatin were prepared as described previously (32Yew P.R. Kirschner M.W.

Mouse ubiquitin was cloned into pQE30 (Qiagen) from a 9.5/10.5 days postcoital mouse embryo library with an N-terminal tag of 6 histidine residues (His6-ubiquitin). Mouse ubiquitin protein was expressed in M15 bacterial cells and purified on nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (Qiagen) under native conditions. Ubiquitin (Sigma) was methylated as described previously and used at a final concentration of 2 mg/ml (37Hershko A. Heller H. Biochem. Cell Biol. Commun. 1985; 128: 1079-1086Google Scholar). Mutations of the Xic1 gene were generated by using the pCS2+/Xic1 plasmid and the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) (32Yew P.R. Kirschner M.W. Science. 1997; 277: 1672-1676Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Xic1 point mutations were generated by making substitutions of the amino acids indicated: NLS1 = R166A, K167A, and R168A; NLS2 = K180A, K182A, and K183A; NLS3 = R206A, K207A, and K208A; c = R33A and L35A; k = F65A and F67A; ck- = R33A, L35A, F65A, and F67A. Following are the oligonucleotide primers (Integrated DNA Technologies) utilized to generate the specified mutations: NLS1, 5′-CTAACACATCTACACAGCGCGCGGCCGCGGAGATCACCACTCCCATC and 5′-GATGGGAGTGGTGATCTCCGCGGCCGCGCGCTGTGTAGATGTGTTAG; NLS2 (ARAA), 5′-CATCACCGATTATTTCCCTGCCCGGGCAGCGATACTGAGTGCCAAGCC and 5′-GGCTTGGCACTCAGTATCGCTGCCCGGGCAGGGAAATAATCGGTGATG; NLS2 (RRRR), 5′-CACCGATTATTTCCCTAGACGTCGACGGATACTGAGTGCCAAGC and 5′-GCTTGGCACTCAGTATCCGTCGACGTCTAGGGAAATAATCGGTG; NLS3, 5′-CTGGAACAGACCCCCGCGGCAGCGATTCGATGAAACC and 5′-GGTTTCATCGAATCGCTGCCGCGGGGGTCTGTTCCAG; c, 5′-GGAGGGGAGCCTGTGCGAATGCCTTCGGTCCTATCG and 5′-CGATAGGACCGAAGGCATTCGCACAGGCTCCCCTCC; and k, 5′-GTCAGAGGTGGAACGCTGACGCTGAAAGTGGCACCC and 5′-GGGTGCCACTTTCAGCGTCAGCGTTCCACCTCTGAC. All point mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing using the Amplicycle Sequencing Kit (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The entire coding sequence of the Xic1-NLS2 (ARAA) subclone was sequenced to confirm that it did not contain any other mutations. Wild type and mutant Xic1 were in vitro transcribed and translated from the SP6 promoter in pCS2+ using [35S]methionine (New Life Science Products) and the TNT-coupled reticulocyte lysate system (Promega). The amounts of protein for all Xic1 mutants were compared with the Xic1-wild type (WT) by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) and PhosphorImager analysis. The amounts of protein for all Xic1 mutants were normalized and added at levels relatively equal to the Xic1-WT level. LSS (20 μl) was mixed with 1 μl of [35S]methionine-labeled Xic1-WT and precleared with 7.5 μl of protein A-Sepharose CL-4B (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for 30 min at 23 °C. After preclearing, the supernatant was incubated with anti-cyclin E, anti-CDK2, or normal rabbit serum for 30 min at 23 °C, and then 7.5 μl of protein A-Sepharose beads were added, and the incubation was continued for 1 h at 23 °C. The protein A-Sepharose beads were pelleted by centrifugation and washed four times with EB (80 mm β-glycerol phosphate, pH 7.4, 20 mm EGTA, and 15 mm MgCl2) containing 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, chymostatin, pepstatin, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, followed by three washes with HBS (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl) at 23 °C (31Shou W. Dunphy W.G. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 457-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The samples were then subjected to SDS-PAGE and quantitation by PhosphorImager analysis using ImageQuant software (Molecular Dynamics). Nuclei were allowed to form by incubating demembranated sperm chromatin (10 ng/μl) in 25 μl of LSS containing 0.1 μg/μl cycloheximide and an energy regenerating system (60 mm phosphocreatine, 1 mm ATP, 150 μg/ml creatine phosphokinase) at 23 °C for 1 h. Following nuclei formation, 0.5 μl/25 μl [35S]methionine-labeled WT-Xic1 was added for nuclear transport assays, whereas 2 μl/25 μl [35S]methionine-labeled GST-Xic1-WT was added for ubiquitination assays, followed by incubation at 23 °C for 45 min. For nuclear transport and certain ubiquitination experiments, methyl-ubiquitin was included at a final concentration of 2 mg/ml. The samples were then diluted 12-fold with NIB (50 mm KCl, 50 mm HEPES-KOH, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm spermine 4HCl, 0.15 mm spermidine 3HCl) and overlaid onto a 300-μl cushion of NIB containing 15% sucrose. The samples were then centrifuged in a Sorvall RC-5B at 5000 ×g in a HB-6 rotor at 4 °C for 10 min. A 20-μl aliquot of supernatant was collected as the cytoplasmic fraction. The pelleted nuclei were washed and recentrifuged twice with 1 ml of NIB containing 250 mm sucrose at 3300 × g for 8 min at 4 °C. Samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE and quantitated by PhosphorImager analysis. The amounts of [35S]methionine-labeled mutant Xic1 proteins were quantitated by PhosphorImager analysis and added at a volume equal to the relative amount of radioactively labeled Xic1-WT or GST-Xic1-WT protein. In general, all [35S]methionine-labeled samples were used between final dilutions of 1:15 to 1:72. Chromatin spin down assays were conducted by including 0.1% Nonidet P-40 in NIB (38Coue M. Kearsey S.E. Mechali M. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1085-1097Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). The percentage of nuclear transport was calculated as the amount of Xic1 in the nucleus divided by the sum of the amount of Xic1 in the nucleus and the cytosol multiplied by 100%. All the samples were normalized to 100% of the WT Xic1 transported to the nucleus. For quantitation analyses, each sample was measured at least two or three times, and the standard error of the mean for each sample was calculated and displayed as error bars. [35S]Methionine-labeled Xic1 (0.5 μl) was incubated in LSS (8 μl) containing cycloheximide, an energy regenerating system, and ubiquitin (1.25 mg/ml) with or without demembranated sperm chromatin (10 ng/μl) at 23 °C for 0, 1, and 3 h. Aliquots of 1.4 μl were removed from the samples for analysis by SDS-PAGE followed by quantitation by PhosphorImager analysis. The amounts of [35S]methionine-labeled mutant Xic1 proteins were added at a volume normalized to equal the same relative amount of radioactively labeled Xic1-WT protein. Dephosphorylation was performed using calf intestinal phosphatase as described previously (32Yew P.R. Kirschner M.W. Science. 1997; 277: 1672-1676Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). DNA replication assays were conducted as described previously with the following modifications (32Yew P.R. Kirschner M.W. Science. 1997; 277: 1672-1676Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 36Blow J.J. Laskey R.A. Cell. 1986; 47: 577-587Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar). [35S]Methionine-labeled Xic1 (0.625 μl) was added to LSS (10 μl) containing cycloheximide, an energy regenerating system, ubiquitin (1.25 mg/ml), and demembranated sperm chromatin (10 ng/μl). DNA replication was normalized to 100% of the control containing unprogrammed rabbit reticulocyte lysate. Each sample was measured three times, and the standard error of the mean for each sample was calculated and displayed as error bars. To begin to understand the requirement for nuclei in Xic1 degradation, we first determined whether Xic1 is transported into nuclei and where ubiquitinated Xic1 is localized. Xenopusinterphase egg extracts derived from a low speed centrifugation of eggs (low speed supernatant or LSS) support the formation of transport-competent nuclei as well as a single round of initiation and elongation phases of semi-conservative chromosomal DNA replication (36Blow J.J. Laskey R.A. Cell. 1986; 47: 577-587Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar,39Newport J.W. Forbes D.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1987; 56: 535-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar, 40Laskey R.A. Leno G.H. Trends Genet. 1990; 6: 406-410Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Demembranated sperm chromatin was preincubated with LSS, followed by the addition of [35S]methionine-labeled Xic1 and His6-ubiquitin and separation of the nuclear and cytosolic fractions by centrifugation. Our results show that polyubiquitinated Xic1 is found exclusively in the nuclear fraction, whereas Xic1 in the cytosolic fraction remains unmodified (Fig.1 A). We next asked whether Xic1 degradation also occurs in the nucleus. To do this, we incubated [35S]methionine-labeled Xic1 with demembranated sperm chromatin in LSS and then separated the nuclei and cytosol. The isolated nuclei and cytosol were added back separately to fresh LSS and incubated for 0 or 3 h. The sample containing nuclei in fresh LSS was again centrifuged to separate the nuclear and cytosolic fractions, and all the samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and PhosphorImager analysis to quantitate the amount of Xic1 remaining. The results show that the nuclear Xic1 pool is 90% degraded after 3 h (Fig.1 B, lanes 1, 2, 6, and 7), whereas Xic1 in the cytosolic fraction remains stable under these conditions (Fig. 1 B, lanes 4,5, 9, and 10). A slower migrating form of Xic1, which most likely represents a mono-ubiquitinated species, was observed in the nucleus (Fig. 1 B, lanes 1 and 2). To eliminate the possibility that Xic1 must be exported to the cytoplasm to be degraded, we tested the degradation of Xic1 in the presence of leptomycin B, a specific inhibitor of CRM1/exportin 1 nuclear export (41Stade K. Ford C.S. Guthrie C. Weis K. Cell. 1997; 90: 1041-1050Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (939) Google Scholar, 42Ullman K.S. Powers M.A. Forbes D.J.

Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 9112-9117Crossref PubMed Scopus (859) Google Scholar). We did not observe any inhibitory effect of leptomycin B on the efficiency of Xic1 degradation (data not shown), an observation consistent with a recent study of Xic1 ubiquitination (33Swanson C. Ross J. Jackson P.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 7796-7801Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Collectively, these results indicate that Xic1 is predominantly ubiquitinated and degraded in the nucleus. Because Xic1 appears to be ubiquitinated and degraded in the nucleus, it is important to identify the sequences of Xic1 that regulate its nuclear localization. The Xic1 primary sequence contains two regions that are likely to contribute to nuclear localization and/or nuclear retention. These regions are comprised of the CDK-cyclin binding region within the N terminus and several putative NLSs within the C terminus of Xic1 (30Su J.Y. Rempel R.E. Erikson E. Maller J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10187-10191Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). The residues of mammalian p27Kip1 critical for CDK-cyclin binding have been identified by mutagenesis and by examination of the co-crystal structure of human CDK2 and cyclin A with a fragment of p27Kip1 (14Vlach J. Hennecke S. Amati B. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5334-5344Crossref PubMed Scopus (609) Google Scholar, 16Montagnoli A. Fiore F. Eytan E. Carrano A.C. Draetta G.F. Hershko A. Pagano M. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1181-1189Crossref PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar, 44Russo A.A. Jeffrey P.D. Patten A.K. Massague J. Pavletich N.P. Nature. 1996; 382: 325-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (801) Google Scholar). Because Xic1 exhibits significant sequence homology with human p27Kip1 in the CDK-cyclin binding domain, we identified and mutated residues in Xic1 that we predicted would disrupt binding of Xic1 to CDK2 (Xic1k: F65A and F67A) and tocyclin E (Xic1c: R33A and L35A) (Fig. 2 A). These Xic1 mutants were in vitro translated with [35S]methionine, added to LSS, and immunoprecipitated with either CDK2 or cyclin E antibodies. The results indicate that both the WT Xic1 and Xic1c mutant readily form trimeric complexes with endogenous CDK2-cyclin E (Fig. 2 B, lanes 1–4), whereas the Xic1k mutant is decreased in its ability to form a trimeric complex with CDK2-cyclin E (Fig. 2 B,lanes 1–4). Interestingly, Xic1k protein bands in association with endogenous CDK2-cyclin E were shifted to slower mobility species that could be converted to a faster migrating species of Xic1 by treatment with calf intestinal phosphatase (Fig.2 B, lanes 5–7). These species may represent Xic1k phosphorylated by a catalytic CDK2-cyclin E that is only loosely associated with the Xic1k mutant or by an alternate kinase present in interphase extracts. When both c and k mutations are combined in Xic1ck− (R33A, L35A, F65A, and F67A), all detectable binding to CDK2 and cyclin E is abolished (Fig.2 B, lanes 1–4). However, it remains possible that a small amount of the Xic1ck− mutant remains very loosely bound to CDK2-cyclin E in the extract and is not stable to coimmunoprecipitation. There are three regions in the C terminus of Xic1 that are rich in arginine and lysine residues (165RRKR, 180KRKK, and 205PRKK), indicating they may be important for nuclear localization of Xic1 through an importin pathway (45Laskey R.A. Gorlich D. Madine M.A. Makkerh J.P.S. Romanowski P. Exp Cell Res. 1996; 229: 204-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). To address how these sequences influence the nuclear localization of Xic1, the residues in each of these three putative NLSs were mutated, resulting in the following mutants: Xic1-NLS1, R166A, K167A, and R168A; Xic1-NLS2 (ARAA), K180A, K182A, and K183A; Xic1-NLS2 (RRRR), K180R, K182R, and K183R; and Xic1-NLS3, R206A, K207A, and K208A (Fig. 2 A). Xic1 mutants were also generated that combined all three individual NLS mutations (Xic1-NLS1/2/3) as well as both CDK2-cyclin E binding mutations and all NLS mutations (Xic1ck−&NLS1/2/3). These mutants were tested for their ability to bind to endogenous CDK2 and cyclin E in LSS. The results show that Xic1-NLS2 (ARAA) and Xic1-NLS1/2/3 both bind endogenous CDK2 and cyclin E efficiently, whereas, as expected, the Xic1-ck-&NLS1/2/3 mutant is totally defective for CDK2-cyclin E binding (Fig. 2 B, lanes 8–11). To examine how either CDK2-cyclin E binding to Xic1 or the putative NLSs contribute to the nuclear localization of Xic1, we tested the Xic1 mutants described in Fig. 2for their abilities to translocate to the nucleus. Xic1 WT and mutants were [35S]methionine-labeled and individually incubated in LSS containing preformed nuclei and supplemented with methyl-ubiquitin. The addition of methyl-ubiquitin allows mono-ubiquitination of lysine residues while preventing polyubiquitination (37Hershko A. Heller H. Biochem. Cell Biol. Commun. 1985; 128: 1079-1086Google Scholar). Because polyubiquitination is largely blocked, degradation by the proteasome is inhibited and mono-ubiquitinated substrate species accumulate. The nuclei were separated from the cytoplasm, and the amount of Xic1 localized to nuclei was determined as a percentage of the total Xic1 in the nucleus and cytosol. The Xic1-WT and mutants Xic1-NLS1, Xic1-NLS2 (ARAA), Xic1-NLS2 (RRRR), and Xic1-NLS3 all translocated efficiently to the nucleus (Fig.3, lanes 2–6). This indicates that no single putative NLS site alone functions as a prototypic NLS. By contrast, both the Xic1-NLS1/2/3 and Xic1ck− mutants were reduced 2.5–3-fold in nuclear transport proficiency compared with WT Xic1 (Fig. 3, lanes 7 and 8). This suggests that the binding of Xic1 to CDK2-cyclin E and the NLS sequences of Xic1 independently contribute equally to efficient nuclear localization or retention. Importantly, when both the CDK2-cyclin E binding sites and NLS sites are mutated together, the ability of Xic1 to localize to the nucleus is severely reduced to near background levels as determined by the amount of the cytoplasmic protein GST found in the nuclear fraction (Fig. 3, lanes 1 and 9). These results suggest that the amount of Xic1 transported to or retained in the nucleus is regulated through the interactions of Xic1 with CDK2-cyclin E and importin. Previous studies have shown that Xic1 degradation is sensitive to the purine analog 6-dimethylaminopurine, an inhibitor of CDKs and DNA replication initiation events (32Yew P.R. Kirschner M.W. Science. 1997; 277: 1672-1676Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 46Blow J.J. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 993-1002Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 47Yan H. Newport J. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). This suggests that Xic1 degradation is dependent on CDK activity or initiation events but does not address whether Xic1 must form a stable trimeric complex with CDK2-cyclin E for its ubiquitination and degradation. Studies show that mutations that disrupt the binding of mammalian p27Kip1 to CDK2-cyclin E eliminate ubiquitination of p27Kip1, indicating that a stable trimeric complex between CDK2-cyclin E-p27Kip1 is necessary for ubiquitination and degradation (14Vlach J.

We used a GST-Xic1 fusion protein for our ubiquitination studies because it facilitated the detection of the ubiquitinated Xic1 species by allowing Xic1 to be labeled to a higher specific activity (Xic1 contains 2 methionines and GST-Xic1 contains 11 methionines). GST-Xic1-WT is localized to both the nucleus and cytosol but is predominantly ubiquitinated in the nucleus, whereas GST is localized predom"

https://openalex.org/W2149908194,"We have compared the primary sequence and enzymatic properties of the sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPases from a cold-tolerant frog Rana sylvatica with those of a closely related cold-intolerant frog,Rana clamitans. Sarcoplasmic reticulum isolated from leg muscles of both species contains a major protein (∼100 kDa) that reacts with a monoclonal antibody against sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase type 1 (SERCA1). The apparent molecular mass of R. sylvatica SERCA1 is 115 kDa, whereas that of R. clamitans is 105 kDa. However, the deduced amino acid sequences obtained from cDNAs do not indicate a difference in molecular weight, thus suggesting post-translational protein modification of R. sylvatica SERCA1. Comparison of the temperature dependence of both ATP hydrolysis and Ca2+transport indicates that R. sylvatica SERCA1 exhibits significantly lower activation energy below 20 °C and an ∼2-fold greater Ca2+-ATPase activity near 0 °C. Furthermore,R. sylvatica SERCA1 exhibits simple Michaelis-Menten kinetics with ATP and Ca2+ as opposed to the two-site ATP kinetics and positive cooperativity with Ca2+ observed forR. clamitans and mammalian SERCA1s. Cooperativity has been linked to protein-protein interaction in SERCA1, and this property may be altered in R. sylvatica SERCA1. Primary sequence comparison shows that R. sylvatica SERCA1 exhibits seven unique amino acid substitutions, three of which are in the ATP binding domain. We also report for the first time the presence of alternative splicing in the frog, resulting in isoforms SERCA1a and SERCA1b. Thus, it appears that the low temperature muscle contractility of R. sylvatica can be explained partially by significant functional and structural differences in SERCA1.

This frog is one of the few vertebrate species that can be frozen solid and revived upon thawing (1Storey K.B. Storey J.M. Physiol. Rev. 1988; 68: 27-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar). R. sylvatica survives freezing by producing very high cryoprotectant concentrations of glucose in vital organs (2Mommsen T.P. Storey K.B. Gen. Comp. Endocrinol. 1992; 87: 44-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 3Constanzo J.P. Lee R.E. Lortz P.H. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 265: R721-R725PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, R. sylvatica mates and lays eggs in water temperatures approaching 0 °C. Because R. sylvatica muscle functions efficiently near 0 °C, the Ca2+ pump must also be functional at low temperatures. However, although the effects of freezing/thawing on several enzymes and physiological processes have been studied (4Dalo N.L. Hackman J.C. Storey K.B. Davidoff R.A. J. Exp. Biol. 1995; 198: 1765-1774PubMed Google Scholar, 5Hemmings S.J. Storey K.B. Cell Biochem. Funct. 1996; 14: 139-148PubMed Google Scholar, 6Hemmings S.J. Storey K.B. Can. J. Physiol. Pharmacol. 1996; 72: 1552-1560Crossref Scopus (29) Google Scholar), no studies on the wood frog skeletal muscle Ca2+-ATPase (SERCA1)1 have been reported. The kinetic properties and amino acid sequence of SERCA1 from Rana esculenta (European green frog) have been reported (7Vilsen B. Andersen J.P. FEBS Lett. 1992; 306: 213-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 8Ogawa Y. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1970; 67: 667-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) and are quite similar to those of the rabbit. However,R. sylvatica muscle could not function at near freezing temperatures if its Ca2+-ATPase had the same properties as the rabbit because rabbit SERCA1 is almost totally inactive at 0 °C (9Eletr S. Inesi G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1972; 290: 178-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Kossler and Kuchler (10Kossler F. Kuchler G. Biomed. Biochim. Acta. 1987; 46: 815-822PubMed Google Scholar) concluded that the main cause of severe inhibition of muscle contraction in the rat at 6 °C is the temperature-dependent inhibition of Ca2+ uptake and release. A similar conclusion was reached for another frogRana temporaria at 10 °C (11Johnson J.D. Jiang Y. Flynn M. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: C1437-C1444Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, SERCA1 is likely to have altered properties in the skeletal muscle of the cold-tolerant frog R. sylvatica. There is a vast amount of knowledge concerning structure/function relationships for SERCA1 because it is one of the most highly studied membrane-associated proteins. Structure/function relationships have recently been reviewed by MacLennan et al. (12MacLennan D.H. Rice W.J. Green N.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28815-28818Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar). The protein was first purified in 1970 by MacLennan (13MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1970; 245: 4508-4518Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the sequence was deduced from the cDNA by MacLennan et al. (14MacLennan D.H. Brandl C.J. Korczak B. Green N.M. Nature. 1985; 316: 696-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (803) Google Scholar). The complete three-dimensional structure has recently been obtained at 2.6-Å resolution by x-ray crystallographic analysis of protein crystals (15Toyoshima C. Nakasako M. Nomura H. Ogawa H. Nature. 2000; 405: 647-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (1609) Google Scholar). This recent advance has confirmed the three-dimensional folding of the domains that had previously been proposed based on protein chemistry and analysis of two-dimensional arrays in membranes. An astonishing proportion of the amino acid residues predicted to be involved in SERCA1 function has been modified by site-directed mutagenesis and the effects on the function of the expressed protein were determined (12MacLennan D.H. Rice W.J. Green N.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28815-28818Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar). However, there is no direct structural information regarding temperature dependence of the pump. In the present study, we have compared structural and functional properties of SERCA1s from R. sylvatica with those ofRana clamitans, a closely related frog living in the same environment that is cold-sensitive and cannot function at 0 °C. Our results indicate that there are significant differences in the kinetic properties of SERCA1 between these two species, including temperature dependence of ATP hydrolysis and Ca2+ transport, kinetics with ATP, and cooperativity of Ca2+ kinetics. We also report the complete amino acid sequences of these two SERCA1s. R. sylvatica andR. clamitans were collected from local ponds in accordance with the guidelines provided by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. The chemicals used for SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and immunoblotting were obtained from Bio-Rad. Chemiluminescence reagents were purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Monoclonal anti-SERCA1, clone VE121G9 was from Affinity BioReagents, Inc. (Golden, CO) as were the monoclonal anti-SERCA2 (MA3-910) clone IID8 and polyclonal anti-peptide anti-SERCA3 (PA1-910) antisera. All three antibodies exhibit cross-reactivity with several mammalian species. Restriction endonucleases were supplied by New England Biolabs, Inc. (Beverly, MA). The Expand® Long Distance PCR kit, which uses a mixture of Taq andPwo polymerases, was from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. ALF® Express Sequencing kit and cyanin dATP-Labeling Mix as well as cyanin-labeled sequencing primers were purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Plasmid preparations were carried out using Qiagen columns (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). Restriction fragments used for subcloning procedures were gel-purified with the QIAEX II Gel Extraction kit (Qiagen). pGEM®-T Easy vector (Promega, Madison, WI) was chosen for direct subcloning of all 5′ and 3′ RACE-PCR products. Gene-specific oligonucleotides were from Life Technologies, Inc. Other molecular biology grade chemicals were purchased from Sigma. Leg muscles were removed from euthanized R. sylvatica captured in late February and from R. clamitans captured in late March, both soon after emergence from hibernation. SR membranes were purified from the homogenized muscle by sucrose density centrifugation using the procedure described by Bull et al.(16Bull R. Marengo J.J. Suarez-Isla B.A. Donoso P. Sutko J.L. Hidalgo C. Biophys. J. 1989; 56: 749-756Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was carried out according to Laemmli (17Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207002) Google Scholar), and immunoblotting was done as described earlier (18Dean W.L. Quinton T.M. Cell Calcium. 1995; 17: 65-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Ca2+-ATPase activity was assayed using a system with ATP hydrolysis coupled to NADH oxidation by pyruvate kinase and lactate dehydrogenase (19Dean W.L. Tanford C. Biochemistry. 1978; 17: 1683-1690Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). In addition to the coupling components, the assay contained 10 mm Tes buffer at pH 7.4, 0.1 mKCl, and 5.0 mm MgCl2. ATP was prepared as a 1:1 MgATP complex. ATP and Ca2+ dependence of Ca2+-ATPase activity were assayed at 30 °C in a Bio-Tek Powerwave X 96-well plate reader, whereas the temperature dependence of Ca2+-ATPase activity was determined in a Cary 219 spectrophotometer. Ca2+-ATPase activity was calculated from the difference in the rate of ATP hydrolysis in the presence of various concentrations of Ca2+ and 2 mm EGTA. For Ca2+ dependence, free [Ca2+] was calculated taking into account the concentrations of total Ca2+, EGTA, Mg2+, ATP, temperature and pH using the Winmaxc program available on the world wide web (Chris Patton, Stanford University). Ca2+ transport was measured using the Ca2+-sensing dye, Rhod2, as described previously (20Quinton T.M. Dean W.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 184: 893-899Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The buffer components were the same as the components listed above for the Ca2+-ATPase assay except that MgCl2 was eliminated, and 2.5 μm Rhod2 was added. ATP (5 mm) was added as the MgATP complex. The assay was carried out at various temperatures in a PerkinElmer LS50B Luminescence Spectrometer with excitation at 553 nm and emission at 576 nm. Before the addition of membranes (a final concentration of 0.1 mg/ml), 0.5 nmol aliquots of CaCl2 were added to calibrate the assay and allow for the determination of Ca2+ transport rates. The addition of BrA23187 at the end of each assay released all sequestered Ca2+ (20Quinton T.M. Dean W.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 184: 893-899Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Kinetic data were analyzed using Enzfitter© software (version 1.05), whereas curve fitting was accomplished using the Slide Write Plus© software (version 5.0). Protein concentration was estimated using bicinchoninic acid (BCA Protein Assay kit, Pierce) with bovine serum albumin as a standard. Uncloned adaptor-ligated double-stranded (ds) cDNA libraries were constructed using the Marathon™ cDNA amplification kit from CLONTECH (Palo Alto, CA) according to manufacturer's instructions. Total RNA was isolated from either an entire wood frog (weighing 1 g) at an early age or a green frog skeletal muscle (weighing 1 g) using the guanidinium thiocyanate/CsCl purification method (21Chirgwin J.M. Przybla A.E. MacDonald R.J. Rutter W.J. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 5294-5299Crossref PubMed Scopus (16653) Google Scholar). 10 μg of total RNA was used for each first-strand synthesis. The Marathon™ cDNA synthesis primer (52-mer) was extended with Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase for 1 h at 42 °C, after which second-strand synthesis was carried out by adding an enzyme mixture containing RNase H, Escherichia coli DNA polymerase I, andE. coli DNA ligase for 2 h at 16 °C. A blunt ending of the ds-cDNAs was performed with T4 DNA polymerase at 16 °C for 45 min. ds-cDNAs were purified by phenol/CHCl3/isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1) extraction precipitated by 95% ethanol in the presence of 4 mammonium acetate. The pellet was washed with 80% ethanol and dissolved in sterile water. The Marathon™ cDNA adaptor was ligated to ds-cDNAs overnight at 16 °C using T4 DNA ligase. 3′ and 5′ RACE-PCR amplifications were performed using the adaptor-ligated ds-cDNAs as template DNAs, a mixture ofTaq and Pwo (with a proofreading activity) polymerases, a common Marathon adaptor-primer 1, and an internal gene-specific primer. For the 3′ RACE-PCR, a gene-specific primer PH+ (5′-TCTGATAAGACTGGTACTCTGACCACC-3′) was derived from the nucleotide sequence coding for the phosphorylation site (350SDKTGTLTT) of the R. esculenta SERCA1a (7Vilsen B. Andersen J.P. FEBS Lett. 1992; 306: 213-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The PH+ primer corresponds to nucleotides 1275–1301 in the R. esculenta cDNA sequence (numbered according to the sequence deposited under GenBankTM accession numberX63009) and to nucleotides 1251–1277 and 1254–1280, respectively, inR. sylvatica and R. clamitans nucleotide sequences described in this study. However, note that the underlined base “T” of the R. esculenta is replaced by a “C” in both R. sylvatica and R. clamitans cDNA sequences. The 3′ RACE-PCR amplifications with the PH+/adaptor primer 1 primer set were carried out for 30 cycles, each cycle consisting of 1 min of denaturation at 94 °C, 1 min of annealing at 60 °C, and 4 min of extension at 68 °C. PCR products were size-fractionated by 1% agarose gel electrophoresis, visualized by ethidium bromide staining, gel-purified, and subcloned into the pGEM®-T Easy vector. For each frog, several clones were partially sequenced. To perform the 5′ RACE-PCR reactions, an antisense primer (5′R−) common for both frog cDNAs, was derived from the partially determined sequence 5′-GTGCACAGATTGTGGCCAACTCCAG-3′. This primer corresponds to the inverse complement of nucleotides 1431–1458 and 1434–1461, respectively, in R. sylvatica and R. clamitans sequences described in this study. 5′ RACE-PCR amplifications with the adaptor primer 1/5′R− primer set were performed using the above mentioned cycle conditions. The 5′ RACE-PCR products were also subcloned in pGEM®-T Easy vector. The composite wood and green frog cDNA nucleotide sequences in both strands were determined completely using several gene-specific primers and the A.L.F.® Express DNA Sequencer (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The sequencing strategy is shown in Fig. 5. For further applications, cDNA clones containing the entire coding regions were obtained by PCR amplifications using the following pair of primers: fcDNA+ (5′-GGCTGAGAGGCGAGGATGGAGAACGCAC-3′) corresponding to nucleotides 189–216 and 191–219, respectively, in wood and green frog cDNAs and fcDNA− (5′-TTATCCTTCAAGGTAGTTACGGGCAACA-3′) corresponding to the inverse complement of nucleotides 3161–3188 and 3164–3191, respectively, in R. sylvatica and R. clamitans sequences. The cycle conditions were the same as above except for a longer extension time (5 min) per cycle at 72 °C. The amplified cDNA products (3.2 kilobase pairs) were subcloned in either pCR®3.1 (for green frog cDNA) orNot I cut and dephosphorylated pcDNA3 (for R. sylvatica cDNA) expression vectors (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA. The accuracy of the nucleotide sequence was verified by complete sequencing of several clones for each frog SERCA cDNA. The primers used to analyze the possibility of an alternative splicing event of the SERCA1 primary transcript are as follows: a 5′ primer, SPLICE+ (5′-GTAGAACAGTGGTTCGTTGTACTG-3′) corresponding to nucleotides 3093–3116 and a 3′ primer, SPLICE− (5′-GCTGCATTCCTTTTACTGTGGTTTAT-3′) corresponding to the inverse complement of nucleotides 3225–3250 in wood frog SERCA cDNA. The adaptor-ligated ds-cDNA served as template DNA. PCR amplification was carried out for 35 cycles, each cycle consisting of 30 s at 94 °C, 30 s at 55 °C, and 30 s at 72 °C. The PCR products were subcloned in the pGEM®-T Easy vector, and several positive clones were sequenced. SDS-polyacrylamide gel analysis of a Coomassie Blue-stained gel is shown in Fig. 1 A. The major protein in the SR of both R. sylvatica and R. clamitans is ∼100 kDa. Both preparations contain lesser amounts of several other proteins. Immunoblot analysis with monoclonal anti-SERCA1 reveals that the major 100-kDa proteins are indeed SERCA1 (Fig. 1 B). Antibodies against SERCA2 and SERCA3 (see “Experimental Procedures” for details) did not recognize any frog proteins. SERCA1 in R. sylvatica exhibits a molecular mass of 115 kDa, whereas that of R. clamitans is ∼105 kDa. Thus, the SERCA1s differ in apparent mass between the two frog species. This is not a general property because the other SR proteins evident in Fig. 1 A exhibit the same molecular weights. This difference in apparent mass could indicate the presence of post-translational modifications that affect the enzymatic properties of the proteins. Kinetic analyses were carried out to determine whether there are functional differences between the two SERCAs. The specific activities at 37 °C of two preparations of R. sylvatica sarcoplasmic reticulum were 0.8 μmol (used in Figs. 1 and2 A) and 3.0 μmol of ATP hydrolyzed/min/mg (used in Figs. 2 B, 3 and 4), whereas the specific activity of a single R. clamitans preparation was 2.7. These values are similar to those observed for rabbits (13MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1970; 245: 4508-4518Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Because we hypothesize that R. sylvatica SERCA1 is more active at 0 °C than that of R. clamitans, we analyzed the temperature dependence of SERCA1 Ca2+-ATPase activity. ATP hydrolysis activity was determined at saturating ATP (10 mm) and Ca2+ (100 μm), and the results were analyzed using the Arrhenius plot after calculating the relative activities normalized to the maximum rate at 37 °C. As shown in Fig. 2 A, R. sylvatica SERCA1 has a higher relative activity at all temperatures tested, and activities for the two frogs at the two lowest temperatures (6 and 2 °C corresponding to 3.584 and 3.636 × 10−3 1/K) are significantly different at the p < 0.005 levelt test. Calculation of the activation energies by linear fitting below 20 °C yields a significantly higher value for the green frog (28 ± 1.8 kcal/mol) (mean ± S.E.) than for the wood frog (23.7 ± 0.6). Extrapolation to 0 °C indicates that the wood frog will exhibit a 2.1-fold higher activity than the green frog. Thus, although the activity is low, the wood frog exhibits significantly higher activity. Fig. 2 B shows a similar analysis for Ca2+transport data. Between 13 and 30 °C, the activation energy for Ca2+ transport is again higher for the green frog, 21.7 ± 0.6 versus 19.0 ± 0.1 kcal/mol (mean ± S.E.), yielding an extrapolated value for Ca2+ transport in the wood frog at 0 °C that is 1.8-fold greater than in the green frog. This result suggests a similar coupling of ATP hydrolysis to Ca2+ transport over a wide range of temperatures. Next, the dependence of ATP hydrolytic rate on ATP concentration was determined. Fitted plots of wood and green frog kinetics are shown in Fig. 3. The R. clamitans SERCA1 data fit a two-site model with K m of 0.005 and 0.34 mm. The correlation coefficient (r 2) for the two-site model is 0.999, whereas attempting to fit the data to Michaelis-Menten kinetics yields a relatively poor correlation coefficient of 0.77. Thus, the green frog exhibits ATP kinetics quite similar to that described for rabbit SERCA1 (19Dean W.L. Tanford C. Biochemistry. 1978; 17: 1683-1690Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). This behavior has been ascribed to half of the site reactivity in a SERCA1 dimer or additional ATP binding sites on a single SERCA1 monomer (22Neet E.E. Green N.M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1977; 178: 588-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the R. sylvatica SERCA1 data can be fitted with a simple single-site Michaelis-Menten model yielding a K m of 0.12 ± 0.03 mm (mean ± S.E.) (r 2 = 0.94). Dean and Tanford (19Dean W.L. Tanford C. Biochemistry. 1978; 17: 1683-1690Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar) demonstrated that the multiple ATP site behavior was lost upon monomer formation of rabbit SERCA1 in C12E8, thus suggesting the possibility that protein-protein interactions are altered in R. sylvatica SR. The combination of higher activity at a low temperature and lower apparent K mcould result in an enhanced ability of R. sylvatica SERCA1 to function at low temperature, especially in the physiological range of ATP concentrations (0.5–5 mm). The kinetics of stimulation of ATP hydrolysis by Ca2+ was also analyzed, as shown in Fig. 4. As indicated by the error bars in the plot, there is a significant difference in the Ca2+ dependence of Ca2+-ATPase activity for the two frogs at both low and high Ca2+ concentrations. The similarity in activities near the center of the plot indicate similar apparent affinities for Ca2+ (0.5 μm). Fitting the plots to a model of positive cooperativity yields a Hill coefficient of 1.5 ± 0.2 (mean ± S.D.) for the green frog indicating a positive cooperativity, a model that has been well established for rabbit SERCA1 (23Verjovski-Almeida S. Silva J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 2940-2944Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, the wood frog data yield a Hill coefficient of 0.9 ± 0.2 (mean ± S.D.) indicating a lack of cooperativity. This result suggests a loss of protein-protein interactions in R. sylvatica SERCA1 because the positive cooperativity of Ca2+ binding to rabbit SERCA1 has been shown to be lost when the protein is dissociated to monomers in C12E8 (23Verjovski-Almeida S. Silva J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 2940-2944Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To obtain the nucleotide sequence of the two frog SERCA cDNAs, we have employed the RACE-PCR strategy (24Frohman M.A. Innis M.A. Gelfand D.H. Sninsky J.J. White T.J. PCR Protocols: A Guide to Methods and Applications. Academic Press, San Diego1990: 28-38Google Scholar), which allows the amplification of both 3′ and 5′ cDNA ends. To conduct the 3′ RACE reactions, a gene-specific oligonucleotide (PH+) was designed from the phosphorylation site of the known sequence of the previously cloned cDNA of the European frog (R. esculenta). For both frog SERCA cDNAs, 3′ RACE-PCR products (2.3 kilobase pairs) were obtained and sequenced. From the obtained sequence, a new primer (5′R−) was generated to amplify the 5′ cDNA ends. The resulting PCR products (1.5 kilobase pairs) were subcloned and sequenced. Using several other sequencing primers, the 3′ and 5′ overlapping PCR products were completely sequenced in both strands. The composite nucleotide sequences of R. sylvatica and R. clamitans SERCA cDNAs were determined (data not shown) (GenBankTM accession numbersAJ298901 and AJ298902). The sequencing strategy is shown in Fig.5. Wood and green frog SERCA cDNAs are, respectively, 3790 and 3793 nucleotides in length. The nucleotide difference is due to the presence of three more nucleotides in the 5′-untranslated region of R. clamitans cDNA (206versus 203 nucleotides in the wood frog sequence). The nucleotide sequence (AGGATGG) surrounding the translation initiation codon (ATG) is found in an acceptable context characteristic of initiation of eukaryotic translation (25Kozak M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 8125-8148Crossref PubMed Scopus (4164) Google Scholar). Two adjacent consensus polyadenylation signals (ATTAAA) (26Proudfoot N.J. Brownlee G.G. Nature. 1976; 263: 211-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (1910) Google Scholar) in the 605-nucleotide 3′-untranslated region of both frog SERCA cDNAs are located, respectively, 18 and 12 nucleotides upstream of the beginning of the poly(A) tract. The primary translation products deduced from the two composite nucleotide sequences are 994 amino acids in length. The predicted molecular masses of R. sylvatica and R. clamitans SERCA proteins are, respectively, 109.7 and 109.3 kDa. In Fig. 6, the deduced amino acid sequence of R. sylvatica SERCA is compared with the sequences of other SERCA pumps expressed in skeletal muscle fromR. clamitans, R. esculenta, and rabbit. In pairwise comparisons, R. sylvatica SERCA exhibits 98% (982 of 994 amino acids) overall identity with green frog SERCA and 95% (948 of 994 amino acids) and 88% (879 of 994 amino acids) identity with R. esculenta and rabbit SERCA1a, respectively. The deduced R. sylvatica SERCA sequence clearly matches that of rabbit fast-twitch skeletal muscle isoform (SERCA1a) at two characteristic points of deviation between rabbit SERCA1a and SERCA2a (expressed in cardiac and slow-twitch muscles) isoforms. One of them is represented by the COOH terminus (ARNYLEG994), whereas the other consists of a 5-amino acid stretch (AAVGN510) located COOH-terminal to Arg505. Therefore, based on these considerations and the overall sequence identity, we suggest that the nomenclature used for R. sylvatica and R. clamitans Ca2+-ATPases that are encoded by the cloned cDNAs be SERCA1a as it was proposed earlier for R. esculenta (7Vilsen B. Andersen J.P. FEBS Lett. 1992; 306: 213-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar).

There are five nonconservative amino acid substitutions (Asn, Gln, Ala, Ser, and Leu) characteristic forR. sylvatica (Fig. 6 and TableI), respectively, at positions 26 (NH2 terminus region), 546, 547, 643 (nucleotide binding domain), and 838 (transmembrane domain M7). In the other SERCA pumps, these positions are occupied by highly conserved residues: Pro26 or Leu26, Leu546, Ser547, Gly643 and Met838.Table IUnique amino acid substitutions in R. sylvaticaSequence positionsylvaticaclamitansesculentaRabbitDomainNonconservative 26GlnProLeuProNH2terminus 546AsnLeuLeuLeuNucleotide binding 547AlaSerSerSerNucleotide binding 643SerGlyGlyGlyNucleotide binding 838LeuMetMetMetM7Conservative 650ThrSerSerAspPhosphorylation 877SerThrThrThrM7/M8 loop Open table in a new tab So far, no information suggesting the alternative splicing of SERCA1 primary transcript in frog species has been reported. We are now providing the first evidence for the expression of two SERCA1 splice variants in a frog species, R. sylvatica, by means of the PCR strategy using SPLICE+ and SPLICE− as primers and the adaptor-ligated ds-cDNA as template. After amplification, two products of 159 and 117 base pairs were detected by 1.8% agarose gel electrophoresis (data not shown). Subcloning and subsequent sequencing confirmed that the 159-base pair PCR fragment corresponded to SERCA1a, whereas the second smaller fragment represented a novel splice variant, SERCA1b. The retention or exclusion of a 42-base pair optional exon (Fig. 7) gives rise, respectively, to SERCA1a and SERCA1b splice variants. The insertion of the optional exon in wood frog SERCA1a occurs immediately after nucleotide 2980 (relative to the ATG codon), which, interestingly, represents the point of divergence between the different splice variants in the related SERCA1, SERCA2, and SERCA3 genes. In turn, the nucleotide sequence divergence in SERCA1a splice variants is reflected at the protein level by a generation of SERCA1 isoforms with different COOH termini. Both isoforms present identical amino"

The primary sequence of α/β-type SASP is highly conserved; however, the N-terminal third of these proteins is less well conserved than the C-terminal two-thirds. To determine the functional importance of residues in the N-terminal region of α/β-type SASP, variants of SspC (a minor α/β-type SASP from Bacillus subtilis) with modified N termini were generated and their structural and DNA binding properties studied in vitro andin vivo. SspC variants with deletions of up to 14 residues (∼20% of SspC residues) were able to bind DNA in vitroand adopted similar conformations when bound to DNA, as determined by circular dichroism spectroscopy and protein-protein cross-linking. Progressive deletion of up to 11 N-terminal residues resulted in proteins with progressively lower DNA binding affinity. However, SspCΔ14 (in which 14 N-terminal residues have been deleted) showed significantly higher affinity for DNA than the larger proteins, SspCΔ10 and SspCΔ11. The affinity of these proteins for DNA was shown to be largely dependent upon the charge of the first few N-terminal residues.

The α/β-type SASP are nonspecific DNA-binding proteins, whose synthesis is developmentally regulated such that these proteins are only synthesized within the developing forespore during sporulation (3Sun D. Stragier P. Setlow P. Genes Dev. 1989; 3: 141-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 4Setlow P. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1988; 42: 319-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). The α/β-type SASP accumulate to very high levels, which are sufficient to saturate the spore chromosome, and DNA within this nucleoprotein complex is protected from a variety of environmental insults (1Setlow P. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 2737-2741Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Setlow P. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1995; 49: 29-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar, 4Setlow P. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1988; 42: 319-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Accordingly, the α/β-type SASP are important determinants of long term spore survival, and spore resistance to heat, peroxides, and UV radiation. Spores ofBacillus subtilis that lack the majority of their α/β-type SASP, termed α−β− spores, are much more sensitive to these treatments than are wild-type spores (1Setlow P. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 2737-2741Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Setlow P. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1995; 49: 29-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar).

Generally, in each species there are two α/β-type SASP that are expressed at very high levels (the major α/β-type SASP), and a variable number of other α/β-type SASP expressed at much lower levels (the minor α/β-type SASP) (4Setlow P. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1988; 42: 319-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). The amino acid sequences of these proteins are highly conserved, both within and between species; however, significant differences in DNA binding affinity between α/β-type SASP have been demonstrated (5Setlow B. Sun D. Setlow P. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 2312-2322Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6Hayes C.S. Peng Z.-Y. Setlow P. J. Biol.

A. 1991; 88: 77-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). During spore germination, the α/β-type SASP are rapidly degraded by a sequence-specific endoproteinase, termed the germination protease (GPR), which recognizes and cleaves within a pentapeptide sequence found within all α/β-type SASP (4Setlow P. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1988; 42: 319-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). The interaction between α/β-type SASP and DNA has been studied in detail, and several features of α/β-type SASP-DNA binding have been characterized (5Setlow B. Sun D. Setlow P. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 2312-2322Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6Hayes C.S. Peng Z.-Y. Setlow P. J. Biol.

Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 4827-4835Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). DNA structure changes from B-DNA to an A-like conformation upon binding to α/β-type SASP (7Mohr S.C. Sokolov N.V.H.A. He C. Setlow P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 77-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 8Griffith J. Makhov A. Santiago-Lara L. Setlow P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8224-8228Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), whereas α/β-type SASP undergo a transition from random coil to a largely α-helical conformation upon binding to DNA (6Hayes C.S. Peng Z.-Y. Setlow P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35040-35050Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The binding interaction is significantly cooperative, with α/β-type SASP having a 50- to ∼600-fold greater affinity for contiguous DNA binding sites than for noncontiguous sites depending upon the bound polynucleotide and the salt concentration (5Setlow B. Sun D. Setlow P. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 2312-2322Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6Hayes C.S. Peng Z.-Y. Setlow P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35040-35050Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The binding cooperativity is thought to be due at least in part to protein-protein interactions between adjacent, DNA-bound α/β-type SASP (8Griffith J. Makhov A. Santiago-Lara L. Setlow P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8224-8228Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 11Hayes C.S. Setlow P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17326-17332Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Contacts between the α-amino group and the carboxylate side chains of three acidic residues found within the N-terminal 40–50% of a variety of α/β-type SASP have been identified previously using a zero-length cross-linking reagent (11Hayes C.S. Setlow P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17326-17332Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). The N-terminal third of α/β-type SASP varies both in length and amino acid sequence, and its sequence is generally less well conserved than the C-terminal two-thirds of these proteins (Fig. 1) (4Setlow P. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1988; 42: 319-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Because individual α/β-type SASP have significantly different affinities for DNA, it seems reasonable to speculate that these differences in binding affinity could be due to differences in the length and sequence of the N-terminal third of these proteins. Consequently, we have investigated the effects of modifications of the N-terminal sequence upon the DNA binding properties of α/β-type SASP. This analysis has further led to a model for α/β-type SASP protein-protein interaction, which involves an electrostatic interaction between the positively charged N-terminal region of one protein and an acidic region on an adjacent, DNA-bound protein. TheEscherichia coli strains used were JM83 (araΔ(lac-proAB) rpsL φ80 lacZΔM15) (12Yanisch-Perron C. Vieira J. Messing J. Gene (Amst.). 1985; 33: 103-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (11410) Google Scholar) and BL21(DE3) (T7 RNA polymerase under control of thelac promoter) (13Studier F.W. Moffatt B.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1986; 189: 113-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (4772) Google Scholar). The B. subtilis strains used were all derivatives of strain 168. E. coli strains were routinely grown in Terrific broth (24 g of yeast extract, 12 g of tryptone, and 4 ml of glycerol per 900 ml, plus 100 ml of 170 mm KH2PO4, 720 mmK2HPO4) at 37 °C with shaking. For the overexpression of cloned genes encoding α/β-type SASP from pET11d vectors (13Studier F.W. Moffatt B.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1986; 189: 113-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (4772) Google Scholar), the medium was supplemented with 200 μg/ml ampicillin and 0.5% glucose. B. subtilis was transformed to kanamycin resistance with pUB110 derivatives as described previously (14Anagnostopoulos C. Spizizen J. J. Bacteriol. 1961; 81: 741-746Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The genes encoding all SspC deletion variants were generated by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using plasmid pPS708 (10Tovar-Rojo F. Setlow P. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 4827-4835Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) as the template and the following oligonucleotide primers. The upstream primers were: SSPC (5′-CCATGGCTCAACAA AGTAGATC), SSPCΔ5 (5′- CCATGGCTAGATCAAACAACAATAATG), SSPCΔ10 (5′-CCATGGCTAATGATTTACTAATTCC), SSPCΔ11 (5′-CCATGGCTGATTTACT AATTCCTCAAGC), SSPCΔ11-D13N (5′-CCATGGCTAATTTACTAATTCCTCAA GC), SSPCΔ11-D13K (5′-CCATGGCTAAATTACTAATTCCTCAAGCAGG), SSPCΔ14 (5′-CCATGGCTATTCCTCAAGCAGCTTCAGC); the downstream primer was SSPC2 (5′-AGCTGGATCCACCATTAGTTCTGTATGG), complementary to nt 530–547 in the sspC sequence (15Connors M.J. Setlow P. J. Bacteriol. 1985; 161: 333-339Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). All upstream primers contained added NcoI restriction endonuclease sites (underlined residues) and the downstream primer contained a BamHI restriction site and 5′-flanking sequences (underlined residues), which were used for cloning purposes. All PCR products were ligated to SmaI-digested pUC19, followed by subcloning into NcoI-BamHI-digested plasmid pET11d for overexpression of SspC variants in E. coli strain BL21(DE3). The identities of all pET11d clones were confirmed by DNA sequencing. To achieve high level expression of SspC variants in spores of B. subtilis, the genes encoding the variants were fused to the strong, sporulation-specific promoter of thesspB gene, which is expressed at the same time in sporulation as sspC (16Mason J.M. Hackett R.H. Setlow P. J. Bacteriol. 1988; 170: 239-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). An NcoI restriction site was first introduced at the initiating methionine codon of thesspB gene by the PCR megaprimer method (17Aiyar A. Leis J. BioTechniques. 1993; 14: 366-369PubMed Google Scholar). The first round of PCR used the upstream primer SSPB1 (5′-ACGGCTAAGCTTTTTTTATTTCTC), complementary to nt 173–196 of the sspB sequence (15Connors M.J. Setlow P. J. Bacteriol. 1985; 161: 333-339Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and the downstream primer SSPB-NCOI (5′-GAGTTTTGGTTAGCCATGGGTAAAATCTCC), complementary to nt 357–386 of the sspB sequence (15Connors M.J. Setlow P. J. Bacteriol. 1985; 161: 333-339Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) to generate a DNA fragment containing the sspB promoter with a site-directed mutation (underlined residue) creating the NcoI site. This PCR product was agarose gel-purified and used as the upstream primer in a second round of PCR with the downstream primer SSPB2 (5′-GGATCCCTTTTTTTCTAGGATATGTGGAGCAGG), complementary to nt 639–665 of the sspB sequence (15Connors M.J. Setlow P. J. Bacteriol. 1985; 161: 333-339Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) to generate a completesspB gene with an added 3′ BamHI site (underlined residues). This fragment was ligated into SmaI-digested pUC19 to generate plasmid pPS2798. The identity of the insert in plasmid pPS2798 was confirmed by DNA sequencing.NcoI-BamHI fragments of all sspCvariants were ligated to NcoI-BamHI-digested plasmid pPS2798 generating the sspB promoter-sspCgene fusions. To introduce the sspB promoter-sspC gene fusions into B. subtilis, these fragments were first subcloned into a pBluescript-pUB110 fusion plasmid (pPS2952). Plasmid pPS2952 was constructed by ligating a pBluescript (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) derivative (a SmaI-HincII fragment was deleted) to a pUB110 derivative (plasmid pUB-B, containing the sspBgene at the unique EcoRI site (10Tovar-Rojo F. Setlow P. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 4827-4835Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)) at theirBamHI sites. The sspBpromoter-sspC-containing pPS2798 plasmids were first digested with BamHI, the ends filled with the large fragment of E. coli DNA polymerase I, and then digested withHindIII to remove HindIII-end-filledBamHI fragments containing the sspBpromoter-sspC gene fusions. These fragments were ligated to plasmid pPS2952 that had been digested with HindIII andHpaI. Finally, the plasmid pPS2952 clones containing thesspB promoter-sspC gene fusions were digested with BamHI to remove pBluescript DNA, the pUB110 derivative fragments agarose gel-purified, religated, and used to transformB. subtilis strain PS356 (α−β−) (18Mason J.M. Setlow P. J. Bacteriol. 1986; 167: 174-178Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) to kanamycin resistance as described (14Anagnostopoulos C. Spizizen J. J. Bacteriol. 1961; 81: 741-746Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). All SspC variants were overexpressed in E. coli strain BL21(DE3) from pET11d-derived plasmids as described previously (13Studier F.W. Moffatt B.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1986; 189: 113-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (4772) Google Scholar). SspC and SspCΔ11-D13K were extracted from dry rupturedE. coli cells with 3% acetic acid, 30 mm HCl and purified as described previously (19Hayes C.S. Setlow P. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 6020-6027Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). SspCΔ10 and SspCΔ11were acid-extracted as described above, but were purified by ion exchange chromatography on a QAE-cellulose column equilibrated in 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) at 4 °C. Proteins were eluted by a linear salt gradient from 0 to 200 mm NaCl in 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) at 4 °C. SspCΔ5, SspCΔ11-D13N, and SspCΔ14 were acid-extracted as outlined above, but were purified by ion exchange chromatography on a CM-cellulose column equilibrated in 10 mm NaOAc (pH 5.5) at 4 °C. Proteins were eluted by a linear salt gradient from 0 to 200 mm NaCl in 10 mm NaOAc (pH 5.5) at 4 °C. Column fractions containing purified α/β-type SASP were pooled, concentrated by lyophilization, and dialyzed exhaustively against 10 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.5). All proteins were >95% pure, as judged by SDS-PAGE and staining with Coomassie Blue. The concentrations of protein stock solutions were determined by quantitative amino acid analysis. Plasmid DNA (pUC19) was purified by two rounds of CsCl equilibrium density centrifugation, and linearized by digestion withEcoRI. Poly(dG)·poly(dC) and poly(dA-dT)·poly(dA-dT) were obtained commercially (Sigma). All polynucleotides were dialyzed exhaustively in Spectra/Por 3 tubing (molecular mass cut-off 3500 Da) against 10 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.5). α/β-type SASP were chemically deaminated as follows; 120 μl of purified protein (∼1 mg/ml in 10 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.5)) was slowly added to 350 μl of 2.5 m NaOAc (pH 5.2), 50 mm sodium glyoxylate, 5 mm CuSO4(20Dixon H.B. Biochem. J. 1964; 92: 661-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 21Van Heyningen S. Dixon H.B. Biochem. J. 1967; 104 (. P): 63Google Scholar). The resulting solution was incubated at 22 °C for 20 min, followed by dialysis in Spectra/Por 3 tubing (molecular mass cut-off 3500 Da) against three 1-liter changes of distilled water at 4 °C for 8 h each. Dialyzed, deaminated protein was frozen, lyophilized, dissolved in ∼50–100 μl of 8 m urea, and dialyzed exhaustively against 10 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.5) at 4 °C. This protein was used for in vitro DNA binding assays. SspC (1 mg/ml) was digested with endoproteinase Asp-N (Sigma) in 10 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.5) at an enzyme to substrate ratio of 1:200 (w/w) at 22 °C for 6 h. SspC (1 mg/ml) was digested with the germination protease (recombinant GPR fromBacillus megaterium) (22Illades-Aguiar B. Setlow P. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 2788-2795Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) at an enzyme to substrate ratio of 1:200 (w/w) in 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 2 mmCaCl2 at 22 °C for 3 h. The C-terminal proteolytic fragments from both digests were purified by reverse phase-HPLC as described (11Hayes C.S. Setlow P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17326-17332Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). DNA binding was assessed in vitro by DNase I protection assays (5Setlow B. Sun D. Setlow P. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 2312-2322Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and by circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy (6Hayes C.S. Peng Z.-Y. Setlow P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35040-35050Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). DNA binding of purified α/β-type SASP was assessed by the ability of protein to protect EcoRI-linearized pUC19 plasmid from DNase I digestion as described previously (5Setlow B. Sun D. Setlow P. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 2312-2322Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19Hayes C.S. Setlow P. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 6020-6027Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). All CD measurements and spectra were obtained on a Jasco 715 spectropolarimeter with a Jasco PS-150–5 power supply, and all recorded spectra were the average of three scans (6Hayes C.S. Peng Z.-Y. Setlow P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35040-35050Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Far UV (protein conformation) spectra were obtained from solutions containing 25 μm α/β-type SASP and 115 μm (in bp) poly(dG)·poly(dC) in 10 mmsodium phosphate (pH 7.5) at 21 °C. Difference spectra corresponding to the α/β-type SASP component of the complex were obtained by subtracting the spectrum of free DNA from the spectra of α/β-type SASP-poly(dG)·poly(dC) complexes as described (6Hayes C.S.

Thermal denaturation of SspC variant-DNA complexes was performed on pre-equilibrated, stirring solutions containing 5 μm SspC variant complexed with 23 μm (in bp) poly(dG)·poly(dC) in 10 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.5) (6Hayes C.S. Peng Z.-Y. Setlow P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35040-35050Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). This amount of DNA is sufficient to bind all wild-type SspC (6Hayes C.S. Peng Z.-Y. Setlow P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35040-35050Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Denaturation was monitored by measuring ellipticity at 222 nm at 0.5 °C intervals as a function of temperature from 20 °C to 90 °C. The midpoint of each transition (defined as TM ) was determined by taking the first derivative of ellipticity at 222 nm with respect to the inverse of the absolute temperature as described (26Cantor C.R. Schimmel P.R. Biophysical Chemistry. Part III: The Behavior of Biological Macromolecules. W. H. Freeman and Co., San Francisco1980Google Scholar). Experimental error was estimated at ±1 °C, based on duplicate measurements of poly(dG)·poly(dC) complexes with SspC, SspCΔ5, and SspCΔ11. Equilibrium binding titrations by CD spectroscopy were performed as described using EcoRI-linearized pUC19 plasmid, poly(dG)·poly(dC), and poly(dA-dT)·poly(dA-dT) (6Hayes C.S. Peng Z.-Y. Setlow P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35040-35050Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). A DNA binding site size of 4 bp was directly determined for SspC, SspCΔ5, SspCΔ11-D13N, and SspCΔ11-D13K from stoichiometric forward titrations of poly(dG)·poly(dC) in 10 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.5) at 21 °C, as was found previously for a number of α/β-type SASP with several DNAs (5Setlow B. Sun D. Setlow P. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 2312-2322Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6Hayes C.S. Peng Z.-Y. Setlow P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35040-35050Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Stoichiometric DNA binding conditions could not be obtained for SspCΔ10, SspCΔ11, Asp-N fragment, and SspCΔ14, although data from forward titrations of poly(dG)·poly(dC) with these proteins under no salt conditions were entirely consistent with the same 4-bp site size. Mean residue ellipticity, [θ]222, values for DNA-bound protein were determined from complexes containing 25 μmprotein and 115 μm (in bp) poly(dG)·poly(dC) under no salt conditions after correction for DNA contributions to ellipticity at 222 nm. Further addition of poly(dG)·poly(dC) above 115 μm resulted in no additional change in α/β-type SASP ellipticity at 222 nm. The binding site size (n) and the mean residue ellipticities at 222 nm for free ([θu]222), and DNA-bound ([θb]222), α/β-type SASP were used to calculate the percentage of bound and free protein at each point in forward titrations according to a two-state model as described (6Hayes C.S. Peng Z.-Y. Setlow P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35040-35050Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The McGhee-von Hippel model was fit to these data by an iterative least squares method (using KaleidaGraph 3.0.2) to obtain apparent binding constants (Kω) for the interaction with pUC19, and intrinsic binding constants (K) and cooperativity factors (ω) for the interaction with poly(dA-dT)·poly(dA-dT) (6Hayes C.S. Peng Z.-Y. Setlow P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35040-35050Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Errors in the fits of K and ω were determined by the model fitting program. The experimental error in Kω determinations was estimated to be ±15% as determined by duplicate titrations of pUC19 DNA with SspC and poly(dA-dT)·poly(dA-dT) with SspCΔ11-D13K. SspC variants were chemically cross-linked in the presence ofEcoRI-linearized pUC19 plasmid DNA with 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide (EDC), and cross-linked products purified by SDS-PAGE as described (11Hayes C.S. Setlow P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17326-17332Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Purified cross-linked and monomeric proteins were digested with trypsin as described (11Hayes C.S. Setlow P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17326-17332Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar) and the digests (100 μl) dialyzed in 100-Da cut-off DispoBiodialyzers™ (Spectrum) against two 1-liter changes of 50 mmNH4HCO3 at 4 °C for 18 h each. Dialyzed tryptic digests were directly analyzed by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry to identify cross-linked peptide species (11Hayes C.S. Setlow P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17326-17332Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Spores of B. subtilis that overexpress variants of SspC were prepared by nutrient exhaustion in 2× SG medium (27Goldrick S. Setlow P. J. Bacteriol. 1983; 155: 1459-1462Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Spores were purified by sonication and distilled water washing at 4 °C (28Nicholson W.L. Setlow P. Harwood C.R. Cutting S.M. Molecular Biological Methods for Bacillus. John Wiley & Sons Ltd., Chichester, England1990: 391-450Google Scholar), and all spores used were >98% pure. Purified spores were analyzed for resistance to both wet heat and UV radiation as described (19Hayes C.S. Setlow P. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 6020-6027Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 29Popham D.L. Sengupta S. Setlow P. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1995; 61: 3633-3638Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Amino acid sequence alignment of all identified α/β-type SASP fromBacillus, Sporosarcina, and“Thermoactinomyces” species show that these proteins are most highly conserved in the C-terminal two-thirds of the protein (Fig.1) (4Setlow P. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1988; 42: 319-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar), and part of this region is thought to be involved in directly contacting the DNA (30Rao H. Mohr S.C. Fairhead H. Setlow P. FEBS Lett. 1992; 305: 115-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). In contrast, the sequence of the N-terminal one third of α/β-type SASP is less well conserved with variations in both length and amino acid sequence (4Setlow P. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1988; 42: 319-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). The identification of protein-protein contacts between amino acid residues found within the N-terminal 40–50% of α/β-type SASP in the DNA-bound state (11Hayes C.S. Setlow P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17326-17332Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar) suggests that the N termini of α/β-type SASP mediate protein-protein interactions which may be important for binding cooperativity, and therefore the apparent binding affinity of the DNA binding interaction. To explore this question in more detail, a number of N-terminal variants of SspC, a minor α/β-type SASP from B. subtilis, were produced and their DNA binding properties analyzed. SspC was chosen for this study because it is easily overexpressed and purified from both B. subtilis spores and E. coli, and its interaction with and effects upon DNA have been studied extensively both in vitro and in vivo (5Setlow B. Sun D. Setlow P. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 2312-2322Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9Nicholson W.L. Setlow B. Setlow P. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 6900-6906Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10Tovar-Rojo F. Setlow P. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 4827-4835Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, SspC binds to DNA with a higher affinity than many other α/β-type SASP, and also has one of the longest N termini of all identified α/β-type SASP (4Setlow P. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1988; 42: 319-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar, 15Connors M.J. Setlow P. J. Bacteriol. 1985; 161: 333-339Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Variants were designed in which blocks of approximately five amino acid residues were progressively removed from the N terminus of SspC (Fig.1). In addition, SspCΔ11 was constructed to assess the effect of an N-terminal deletion that removes an asparagine residue conserved in all α/β-type SASP from Bacillusspecies and their close relatives (Fig. 1). Each deletion variant was designed such that the protein would contain an N-terminal alanine residue after post-translational removal of the initiating methionine residue (Fig. 1), since alanine is the N-terminal residue of most α/β-type SASP (4Setlow P. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1988; 42: 319-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar, 31Driks A. Setlow P. Brun Y.V. Shimkets L.J. Prokaryotic Development.

https://openalex.org/W2045255512,"We have shown previously that Bcl-XS causes acute cell death in 3T3 cells without activating caspases (Fridman, J. S., Benedict, M. A., and Maybaum, J. (1999) Cancer Res. 59, 5999–6004). In this study, we determined that the explanation for lack of caspase activation is the cellular depletion of cytochrome c. Electron microscopy revealed gross structural changes in the mitochondria of Bcl-XS-expressing cells; however, cytochrome c was not detected in cytosolic fractions from these cells. Surprisingly, it was determined that cellular cytochromec levels decreased as Bcl-XS expression levels increased. Experiments performed to eliminate other possible explanations for the lack of caspase activation showed that these 3T3 cells have a functional cytoplasmic apoptosome, a complex of proteins that form a functional trigger capable of activating the proximal caspase in an apoptotic pathway Chinnaiyan, A. M. (1999) Neoplasia 1, 5-15, as cytosolic extracts from these cells were capable of cleaving pro-caspase-9. These cells were also able to release cytochromec from their mitochondria after appropriate stimulation, other than Bcl-XS expression (i.e. withdrawal from serum for 24 h), and initiate a cell death that is inhibited by a dominant negative caspase-9. We conclude that lack of caspase activation is due to a Bcl-XS-induced depletion of active cytochromec, a phenomenon that represents an alternative cell death effector pathway and/or a novel mechanism for regulating caspase activation. We have shown previously that Bcl-XS causes acute cell death in 3T3 cells without activating caspases (Fridman, J. S., Benedict, M. A., and Maybaum, J. (1999) Cancer Res. 59, 5999–6004).

Bcl-2 homology dominant negative caspase-9 apoptosis-inducing factor tetracycline actinomycin D high performance liquid chromatography Tris-buffered saline with Tween 20 voltage-dependent anion channel hemagglutinin Bcl-XS, belongs to the Bcl-2 family of proteins, whose members can either promote or inhibit cell death, depending on their structural features. These features are referred to as Bcl-2 homology (BH)1 domains and are highly conserved throughout this family of proteins). The pro-survival proteins, Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL, contain a BH1, BH2, BH3, and a BH4 domain, whereas the pro-death members of the family have, at least, a BH3 domain. The BH1, BH2, and BH3 domains form a hydrophobic binding pocket into which a BH3 domain of another family member binds, forming either a hetero- or a homodimer (3Aritomi M. Kunishima N. Inohara N.

It has been proposed that the ratio of the pro-survival to pro-death members of this family determines the propensity of a cell to live or die (5Oltvai Z.N. Milliman C.L. Korsmeyer S.J. Cell. 1993; 74: 609-619Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5865) Google Scholar, 6Finucane D.M. Bossy-Wetzel E. Waterhouse N.J. Cotter T.G. Green D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2225-2233Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (650) Google Scholar), although the specific mechanisms by which a pro-death or a pro-survival family member act are still poorly understood. The most extensively studied pro-death family member, Bax, has a BH1 and a BH2 domain in addition to the obligatory BH3 domain. These domains (BH1 and BH2) are part of the proposed membrane-spanning domain that forms channels in synthetic membranes and lipid vesicles (7Muchmore S.W. Sattler M. Liang H. Meadows R.P.

The ability to form such channels is one of the proposed models by which Bax may act (8Schlesinger P.H. Gross A. Yin X.M. Yamamoto K. Saito M. Waksman G. Korsmeyer S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

A. 1998; 95: 14681-14686Crossref PubMed Scopus (870) Google Scholar). Bcl-XS, in contrast to Bax, lacks BH1 and BH2 domains. Therefore, Bcl-XS should not form membrane-spanning channels and thus acts through a different mechanism. Bcl-XS does, however, have a BH3 domain as well as a BH4 domain (thought to allow for protein-protein interactions outside the Bcl-2 family), a unique combination among the Bcl-2 family members. Although there are no other known pro-death Bcl-2 family members that have only BH3 and BH4 domains, there are a number of BH-3-only proteins including, Hrk, Bik, Bad, and EGL-1. These proteins are thought to act either by binding to and inactivating the pro-survival functions of Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL (or related proteins), or by displacing pro-death Bcl-2 family members that are capable of forming transmembrane channels, from Bcl-2 or Bcl-XL, thereby allowing them to kill the cell. If either of these models is correct, then the outcome will be disruption of the functionality and/or integrity of organelles in which these proteins are concentrated, the mitochondria and endoplasmic reticulum. Mitochondria have been the focus of the majority of studies aimed at explaining the role of the Bcl-2 family in cell death. Evidence for such a role includes the following; 1) cell death has been correlated with loss of the mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨm), and 2) release of apoptogenic factors including cytochrome c, AIF, and caspases has been observed upon mitochondrial disruption. The mechanism by which Bcl-2-related proteins affect the mitochondria is not clear. However, it has been shown that Bax can cause release of cytochrome c from mitochondria, whereas Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL can prevent such a loss induced by Bax or other insults (in isolated mitochondria and in whole cells) (6Finucane D.M.

Cytochrome c, once released into the cytosol, becomes part of an apoptosome by binding Apaf-1 in an ATP-dependent manner. This binding allows for the oligomerization of Apaf-1 molecules and the recruitment of pro-caspase-9. Pro-caspase-9 is then thought to be activated by a proximity model that utilizes the low but significant catalytic activity of the pro-caspase (15Muzio M. Stockwell B.R. Stennicke H.R. Salvesen G.S.

A. 1999; 96: 10964-10967Crossref PubMed Scopus (774) Google Scholar). This initiates a caspase cascade and apoptosis. We have shown recently that Bcl-XS can kill 3T3 cells and that this cell death does not require, nor does it activate, caspases (1Fridman J.S. Benedict M.A. Maybaum J. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 5999-6004PubMed Google Scholar). In that report we proposed four possible mechanisms of action for Bcl-XS in 3T3 cells (see Fig. 1). The first of these models, the activation of caspases through the release of cytochrome c from the mitochondria, was found not to be true; however, we did find that expression of Bcl-XS was temporally coincident with collapse of the mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨm) and was therefore affecting the mitochondria. In this study, we sought to determine why caspases are not activated upon expression of Bcl-XS and to determine which, if any, of the proposed mechanisms (Fig.1) is responsible for Bcl-XS-mediated death in 3T3 cells. 3T3XS7.2 cells and stable derivatives of these cells expressing Bcl-XL or dominant negative caspase-9 (9DN) were derived and maintained as described previously (1Fridman J.S. Benedict M.A. Maybaum J. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 5999-6004PubMed Google Scholar). Approximately 5 × 1053T3XS7.2 cells, or their Bcl-XL-overexpressing derivatives, were plated in 100-mm tissue culture dishes and allowed to grow for 24–48 h in the presence of tetracycline (TET). In the TET withdrawal time-course experiment, plates were withdrawn from TET at different times so that all samples were collected at the same time. After removal of medium, cell monolayers were fixed with 2% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 m Sorensen's buffer, pH 7.4. The aspirated media was centrifuged to pellet floating cells that were subsequently pooled with their respective adherent cells. Cells were fixed in 1% osmium tetroxide and dehydrated in a graded series of ethanol. Cell pellets were embedded in Spurr's resin. Ultrathin sections, showing a silver interference color, were collected and stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate. Sections were viewed on a Philips CM100 electron microscope. Cytosolic extracts were prepared by washing cells twice in cold phosphate-buffered saline. All additional steps were performed at 4 °C or on ice. Cells were resuspended in cold buffer A (20 mm Hepes (pH 7.5), 10 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm Na-EGTA, 1 mm Na-EDTA, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 220 mm mannitol, 200 mm sucrose) and Complete protease inhibitors (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and left for 40 min on ice. Cells were then disrupted by Dounce homogenization (45 strokes). The solution was then centrifuged twice at 500 ×g to remove nuclei and unlysed cells. The supernatant was then spun at 14,000 rpm in a microcentrifuge at 4 °C for 30 min. The supernatant, referred to as the cytosolic extract, was removed and stored at −80 °C until used. The pellet was also saved and stored at −80 °C and is considered to contain the membrane fraction greatly enriched in mitochondria. Protein concentrations for cytosolic extracts were normalized and loaded onto SDS-polyacrylamide gels. For whole cell samples, cells were counted, centrifuged at 500 ×g, and resuspended in sample buffer (17Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1971; 227: 680-685Crossref Scopus (207231) Google Scholar) and boiled. Equivalent numbers of cells were loaded onto SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Following electrophoresis, proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (equal protein loading was confirmed by Ponceau-S staining) and blocked for at least 2 h in TBST (Tris-buffered saline and 0.1% Tween 20) containing 5% (w/v) milk. All primary antibodies were diluted in TBST containing 1% milk, and incubations were carried out for either 2 h at room temperature or overnight at 4 °C. After each incubation, membranes were washed six times in TBST. Anti-cytochrome c antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) was used at 1:500 or 1:1000 (PharMingen, San Diego, CA), anti-Hsp60 antibody (Stressgen Incorporated) was used at 1:2000, and anti-VDAC (porin) (Calbiochem) was used at 1:200. Secondary antibodies were used at 1:50,000 (Pierce). Chemiluminescent detection of cytochrome c was performed as described (18Dorward D.W. Anal. Biochem. 1993; 209: 219-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 19Vargas C. McEwan A.G. Downie J.A. Anal. Biochem. 1993; 209: 323-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Briefly, cells were lysed in 2× sample buffer (17Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1971; 227: 680-685Crossref Scopus (207231) Google Scholar) without β-mercaptoethanol and spun in a microcentrifuge on full speed for 5 min. Protein content of the supernatants was determined, and 50 μg of each sample was subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes and incubated with Pierce SuperSignal West Dura Extended Duration Chemiluminescent Substrate, as indicated by the manufacturer, and signal was detected by autoluminescence on film. [35S]Methionine (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) -labeled pro-caspase-9 was made using the TnT Coupled Reticulocyte Lysate System (Promega Corp., Madison, WI) following the manufacturer's protocols. The translation mix was then applied to a G-25 desalting column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) to remove nucleotides and unincorporated radioactive amino acids. Aliquots were stored at −80 °C. Cleavage assays were performed with a final volume of 50 μl with volume adjusted using Buffer A. Then 20, 40, or 80 μg of protein was incubated with 2 μl of35S-caspase-9, in the presence or absence of bovine cytochrome c (Sigma) and dATP. Reaction tubes were incubated at 30 °C for 60 min, and the reaction was stopped by addition of 15 μl of 5 × sample buffer and boiling. Samples were loaded onto a SDS-polyacrylamide gel or frozen at −80 °C. Electrophoresed gels were fixed, dried, and exposed to BioMax MS film using a Transcreen LE intensifying screen (Eastman Kodak Co.) at −80 °C for 2–8 days. Cells were grown in the presence or absence (−TET) of tetracycline for the indicated period of time. +Fas/Act D cells are 3T3XS7.2 cells treated with activating anti-Fas antibody (500 ng/ml) and actinomycin D (4 μm) for 8 h in the presence of TET. Medium was saved from the culture dishes to retain any floating cells. Adherent cells were harvested and combined with their respective floating cell populations. Nucleotides were extracted from an equal number of cells with ice-cold 0.4 n perchloric acid and subsequently neutralized. Nucleotides were separated and quantified by strong anion-exchange HPLC using a Waters (Milford, MA) gradient system controlled by Millenium 2010 software (20Shewach D.S. Hahn T.M. Chang E. Hertel L.W. Lawrence T.S. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 3218-3223PubMed Google Scholar). Cellular ATP levels were quantified by comparison of their peak areas with that of a known amount of standard. 3T3XS7.2 or 9DN cells (stable derivatives of the 3T3XS7.2 cells expressing a dominant negative caspase-9) were plated in six-well dishes and allowed to grow for 24–48 h. Cells were maintained in the presence of TET (1 μg/ml tetracycline) and were transfected with 0.825 μg of pK7GFP (a constitutive GFP-expressing construct) and 2.5 μg of pSFFVneo-Bcl-XL-FLAG, pSFFVneo-Bcl-XS-HA (a gift from Garbriel Nunez, University of Michigan), or pCDNA3-Bax-FLAG (a gift from Claudius Vincenz, University of Michigan) using Suprafect (Qiagen, Santa Clarita, CA), following the manufacturer's protocol. Twenty-four hours after transfection, cells were examined by fluorescence microscopy and scored as live (flat cells with extensions) or dead/dying cells (rounded, floating cells). At least 200 cells were counted whenever possible; in most cases, however, 200 green cells did not exist in Bax transfections of 3T3XS7.2 cells, presumably due to the toxicity of that gene product. Statistical analyses were performed using the analysis of variance on the proportion of dead out of total cells counted. The major hypothesis, that of a difference in the presence or absence of dominant negative caspase-9 upon transfection with Bcl-XS or Bax, was tested as an interaction contrast. Homogeneity of variance was acceptable in all treatments except Bax, where the S.D. was 2–3 times what it was in the other three transgenes. The untransformed proportion was used in analyses utilizing SAS Proc GLM. We have shown previously that enforced expression of Bcl-XS causes a loss of mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨm) in 3T3 cells, and that this occurs without subsequent activation of caspases (1Fridman J.S. Benedict M.A. Maybaum J. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 5999-6004PubMed Google Scholar). To look more closely at the mitochondrial changes, electron microscopy was performed on 3T3XS7.2 cells (a stable derivative of 3T3 cells expressing Bcl-XS in a tetracycline-repressible manner) as expression of Bcl-XS was induced (−TET). The mitochondria of Bcl-XS-expressing cells appear less electron-dense or even transparent (Fig. 2, markedM*), indicating lack of protein and membrane content. The structure of the cristae, in the mitochondria in which cristae were still visible, no longer filled the interior of the mitochondria. The cristae appeared broken and/or pushed against the outer mitochondrial membrane. In contrast, the mitochondria of the control cells (+TET) (Fig. 2, marked M) appeared electron-dense and, therefore, contain a substantial amount of membranes and protein. The cristae were numerous, intact, and healthy, as they spanned all regions of the mitochondria. The effects of Bcl-XS expression on the mitochondria were negated by the stable expression of Bcl-XL in these cells (Fig. 2,bottom); however, they were not prevented by pretreatment with the broad-spectrum caspase inhibitor z-VAD-fmk (up to 100 μm) or by expression of a dominant negative caspase-9 (data not shown). Expression of β-galactosidase in the identical expression vector also did not affect the mitochondria (data not shown). In cells expressing Bcl-XS we also observed large, opaque, vesicles that are not membrane-bound (Fig. 2, marked L). These masses are lipid depositions often seen during mitochondrial distress (21-24) and do not arise in control (+TET) cells or β-galactosidase-expressing cells (data not shown). Pretreatment with zVAD-fmk or expression of dominant negative caspase-9 did not prevent the formation of these vesicles (data not shown); however, expression of Bcl-XL did preclude their appearance (Fig. 2). These Bcl-XL-expressing cells also did not show a loss of ΔΨmupon expression of Bcl-XS, as opposed to the parental 3T3XS7.2 cells. 2J. S. Fridman, J. Parsels, A. Rehemtulla, and J. Maybaum, unpublished data. The morphologic changes in the mitochondria upon expression of Bcl-XS (and the depolarization of the mitochondria), led to the assumption that cytochrome c was being released into the cytosol of the cells. This should have initiated the formation and activation (in the presence of sufficient ATP) of the Apaf-1-cytochromec-caspase-9 apoptosome (22Li P. Nijhawan D. Budihardjo I. Srinivasula S.M. Ahmad M. Alnemri E.S. Wang X. Cell. 1997; 91: 479-489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6239) Google Scholar, 23Zou H. Li Y. Liu X. Wang X. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11549-11556Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1799) Google Scholar). The fact that 9DN could inhibit cell death induced by withdrawal from serum suggested that such an apoptosome was functional in these cells. Therefore, the previously observed lack of caspase activation upon Bcl-XS expression was unanticipated (1Fridman J.S. Benedict M.A. Maybaum J. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 5999-6004PubMed Google Scholar). To determine whether cytochrome c was being released into the cytosol upon expression of Bcl-XS, cytosolic extracts were made from 3T3XS7.2 cells at various times after withdrawal from TET, or after withdrawal from serum for 24 h. Withdrawal from serum for 24 h caused approximately the same extent of cell death (as assessed morphologically and/or by trypan blue exclusion) as did withdrawal from TET for 36 h (data not shown). Release of cytochrome c into the cytosol was not detected upon expression of Bcl-XS (Fig.3 A). In contrast, 24 h after serum withdrawal, cytochrome c was easily detected in the cytosol. These results explain why serum withdrawal-induced death, but not death induced by expression of Bcl-XS, is inhibited by 9DN (data not shown and Ref. 1Fridman J.S. Benedict M.A. Maybaum J. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 5999-6004PubMed Google Scholar). However, the observed loss of ΔΨm (1Fridman J.S. Benedict M.A. Maybaum J. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 5999-6004PubMed Google Scholar) and the apparent destruction of the mitochondrial structure (Fig. 2) did not correlate with lack of detectable cytochrome c release. To investigate the possibility that cytochrome c was not being released from the mitochondria because there was no cytochromec to be released, we made whole cell extracts from the same cells used to make cytosolic extracts above (Fig. 3 B). Upon expression of Bcl-XS, first detectable between 24 and 30 h after withdrawal from TET (Fig. 3 C) (1Fridman J.S. Benedict M.A. Maybaum J. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 5999-6004PubMed Google Scholar), the cellular levels of cytochrome c decreased slightly. This decrease became more pronounced as the time of withdrawal from TET increased. Cytochromec was barely detectable 36–48 h after TET withdrawal; however, it was still present after withdrawal from serum for 24 h. To circumvent the possibility of a lack of antibody reactivity due to cytochrome c modification(s), we used two antibodies for immunoblot analyses, a polyclonal antibody raised against the full-length protein and a monoclonal antibody raised against three unique regions of the protein. Two extraction buffers, a SDS-based buffer and a Nonidet P-40-based buffer, were used for cytochromec immunoblots and gave identical results (data not shown). Additionally, we took advantage of the covalently bound iron atom in cytochrome c and its inherent peroxidase activity to oxidize a chemiluminescent substrate (ECL) (18Dorward D.W. Anal. Biochem. 1993; 209: 219-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 19Vargas C. McEwan A.G. Downie J.A. Anal. Biochem. 1993; 209: 323-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Using this technique we show that a band that comigrates with (and is the expected size of) purified bovine cytochrome c is also depleted upon expression of Bcl-XS, with similar kinetics as in the Western blot (Fig. 3 D). This decrease in cytochrome c was not common to all mitochondrial proteins as the mitochondrial matrix protein Hsp60 and the outer membrane protein VDAC were not depleted after withdrawal from TET (Fig. 3 E). Additionally, confocal microscopy showed that the mitochondrial intermembrane space protein AIF was redistributed in the cytoplasm, but was not degraded upon expression of Bcl-XS (data not shown). These experiments led to the hypothesis that Bcl-XS does not induce caspase activation because cytochrome c is not present to a sufficient degree in the cytosol of Bcl-XS-expressing cells to complete and activate the mitochondrial apoptosome(s). To confirm that the lack of detectable cytochrome c, in the cytosolic fractions from Bcl-XS-expressing cells, was the explanation for absence of caspase activation in these cells, in vitro pro-caspase-9 cleavage assays were performed using cytosolic extracts from 3T3XS7.2 cells (grown in the presence of TET) or from 293T cells and35S-labeled human pro-caspase-9. 293T cells have previously been shown to possess the very catalytically active Apaf-1XL (25Hu Y. Benedict M.A. Ding L. Nunez G. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3586-3595Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar) and, therefore, served as a positive control in this assay. Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction of Apaf-1 from the 3T3XS7.2 amplified an Apaf-1 equivalent in size to the human Apaf-1L (data not shown) and should, consequently, be slightly less efficacious than the Apaf-1XL from 293T cells. Cytosolic extracts from either 293T cells or 3T3XS7.2 cells were able to process 35S-labeled human pro-caspase-9 in the presence, but not in the absence of exogenously added dATP and bovine cytochromec (Fig. 4 A). The presence of two cleavage products upon apoptosome activation is the result of both autoprocessing (caspase-9 cleavage of pro-caspase-9) and processing by downstream effector caspases, such as caspase 3 (25Hu Y. Benedict M.A. Ding L. Nunez G. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3586-3595Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar). These results confirm that a cytosolic apoptosome is functional in these cells and that complementation of these extracts with cytochromec and dATP is sufficient to activate the proximal caspase in a cell death pathway. We also looked at the ability of cytosolic extracts from 3T3XS7.2 cells expressing Bcl-XS (−TET for 36 h) to cleave pro-caspase-9. These extracts were also able to cleave pro-caspase-9 in the presence, but not in the absence, of exogenously added cytochrome c and dATP (Fig. 4 B). Finally, an alternative explanation for the lack of caspase activation in these cells (upon expression of Bcl-XS) could be the presence of some type of inhibitor in these cells. These experiments also serve to disprove this possibility as such an inhibitor (e.g. an inhibitor of apoptosis) should have also prevented the processing of pro-caspase-9 in vitro. We do, however, recognize the possibility that an inhibitor may exist and that it was lost during the preparation of the cytosolic fraction. However, the fact that these cells die upon withdrawal from serum and that this death is inhibited by 9DN argues that the apoptosome is functional in whole cells (1Fridman J.S. Benedict M.A. Maybaum J. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 5999-6004PubMed Google Scholar). To strengthen the hypothesis that lack of detectable caspase activity in the presence of Bcl-XS expression is due to lack of cytochrome c in the cytosol, we examined another possible explanation, insufficient ATP levels. ATP is required for the oligomerization of Apaf-1 and activation of pro-caspase 9 (22Li P. Nijhawan D. Budihardjo I. Srinivasula S.M. Ahmad M. Alnemri E.S. Wang X. Cell. 1997; 91: 479-489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6239) Google Scholar, 23Zou H. Li Y. Liu X. Wang X. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11549-11556Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1799) Google Scholar, 25Hu Y. Benedict M.A. Ding L. Nunez G. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3586-3595Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar). We measured ATP levels in cells that were dying by induction of Bcl-XS expression (noncaspase mediated) or by a caspase-mediated cell death induced by treatment with Fas/Act D. Nucleotides were extracted from 3T3XS7.2 at various times after withdrawal from TET, or after 8 h of Fas/Act D treatment (in the presence of TET). Extracted nucleotides were resolved and quantified by strong anion-exchange HPLC. The results show no significant decrease in the levels of ATP from whole cells upon expression of Bcl-XS out to 48 h (TableI). There was, however, an approximate 50% decrease in the amount of ATP extracted from cells treated with Fas/Act D. These cells have previously been shown to have significant caspase activity at this time point (1Fridman J.S. Benedict M.A. Maybaum J. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 5999-6004PubMed Google Scholar). As caspase activity is an energy-consuming process, the decreased ATP levels upon Fas/Act D treatment are not a surprise. However, it is interesting that, after structural disruption of the mitochondria and loss of the ΔΨm, Bcl-XS-expressing 3T3 cells do not show a decrease in ATP levels. In fact, there is a reproducible increase in the cellular ATP content. This increase may result from either an increase in the production of ATP or from a decrease in its utilization/degradation. Considering the observed loss of ΔΨm and the perturbations in the mitochondria upon expression of Bcl-XS, it seems more likely that the cause is a decrease in the utilization of ATP.Table ICellular ATP levelsTreatmentCellular ATP content (relative to control)%Control100−TET (24 h)95.5 ± 3.2−TET (36 h)134.3 ± 9.4−TET (48 h)131.5 ± 17.3+Fas/Act D (8 h)51.5 ± 5.3 Open table in a new tab After determining that Bcl-XS kills 3T3 cells without caspase activation, because of a depletion of cytochrome c, we wanted to address another of the mechanisms proposed for Bcl-XS-induced cell death (Fig.1). One of the described mechanisms entails the displacement, by Bcl-XS, of a pro-death Bcl-2 family member that possesses potential membrane-spanning domains, such as Bax. To test if Bcl-XS kills 3T3 cells by displacing such a protein, we performed the following experiments. Stable cell lines expressing 9DN were derived from our 3T3XS7.2 cells (1Fridman J.S. Benedict M.A. Maybaum J. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 5999-6004PubMed Google Scholar). The 9DN cells were shown to express dominant negative caspase-9 both by immunoblot analysis2 and functionally, by resistance to serum withdrawal (1Fridman J.S. Benedict M.A. Maybaum J. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 5999-6004PubMed Google Scholar). The 3T3XS7.2 cells and the 9DN cells were transiently transfected (in the presence of TET) with Bcl-XS, Bcl-XL, or Bax, along with a plasmid coding for a green fluorescent protein (pk7GFP) at a ratio of 3:1. The presence of TET throughout this experiment ensures that the TET-dependent expression of Bcl-XS is turned off and only the transiently transfected transgenes are expressed (data not shown). Twenty-four hours after transfection, the cells were examined by fluorescent microscopy. Green cells were scored morphologically as either live (flat cells with normal stellate morphology) or dead (rounded or floating) (Fig. 5). Two hundred cells were counted wherever possible, but, in three of four experiments, 200 surviving green cells could not be found in theBax transfected 3T3XS7.2 cells. This is in comparison to thousands of green cells in the other conditions, including theBax transfections of the 9DN cells (data not shown). Analysis of variance showed that day-to-day variation was marginally significant (p = 0.064), indicating the importance of comparing results obtained on the same day of experimentation. Therefore, all data are paired, allowing comparison of results from the individual experiments. 9DN cells were slightly more resistant than the 3T3XS7.2 cells to base-line transfection cytotoxicity withBcl-XL. However, there was no difference between cell lines transfected with Bcl-XS. The hypothesis that 9DN protects against Bax-induced, but not Bcl-XS-induced, cell death was tested using a statistical interaction contrast (see “Experimental Procedures” for explanation), with the cell line effect (3T3XS7.2versus 9DN) for Bcl-XS contrasted with the cell line effect for Bax. This contrast was significant (p = 0.031), with the difference in the fraction of cells surviving (9DN surviving fraction minus 3T3XS7.2 surviving fraction) being 0.006 for Bcl-XS but 0.139 for Bax. Therefore, Bcl-XS-induced cell death (since it is not inhibited by a dominant negative caspase 9) proceeds, at least in part, through a pathway that does not utilize Bax or another Bcl-2 family member which requires a functional caspase 9. These data argue against the proposed model for Bcl-XS-induced cell death in which Bcl-XS displaces another pro-death Bcl-2 family member (which then kills the cell), such as Bax. This study presents two important findings regarding Bcl-XS-induced cell death and the regulation of cell death as a whole. The most significant finding is the cellular depletion of cytochromec that is temporally coincident with detectable expression of Bcl-XS and that prevents caspase activation during Bcl-XS-induced cell death in 3T3 cells. Second, Bcl-XS was shown to kill 3T3 cells by a pathway distinct from Bax and, therefore, does not require the activity of a pore-forming Bcl-2 family member, such as Bax. These findings support a model for the mechanism of action of Bcl-XS in 3T3 cells that entails inhibition of the death-suppressing effects of Bcl-2 or related proteins (i.e. a dominant negative Bcl-2) by direct interaction with such proteins (27Holinger E.P. Chittenden T. Lutz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13298-13304Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar, 28Kelekar A. Thompson C.B. Trends Cell Biol. 1998; 8: 324-330Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (539) Google Scholar). The observed depletion of cytochrome c is a novel mechanism for the prevention of caspase activation. Although various structural alterations to cytochrome c have been observed in other systems during programmed cell death, such as Jurkat cells (29Adachi S. Cross A.R. Babior B.M. Gottlieb R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21878-21882Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 30Krippner A. Matsuno-Yagi A. Gottlieb R.A. Babior B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21629-21636Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar) and in Drosophila (26Varkey J. Chen P. Jemmerson R. Abrams J.M. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 701-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar), in neither system was cytochromec depleted from the cells, nor was caspase activation prevented. In the present study, complementation of cytosolic extracts (from 3T3XS7.2 cells expressing Bcl-XS) with exogenous cytochromec restored the ability of these extracts to process pro-caspase-9, confirming that the lack of cytosolic cytochromec was the explanation for the lack of caspase activation. Of the four models to explain how Bcl-XS can kill 3T3 cells presented in this study (Fig. 1), the data described previously (1Fridman J.S. Benedict M.A. Maybaum J. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 5999-6004PubMed Google Scholar) disproved the first hypothesis, the activation of caspases, whereas the data presented here describe the mechanism by which caspase activation is prevented. Evidence supporting this mechanism, the depletion of cytochrome c, includes the following. First, there is a temporal coincidence between expression of Bcl-XS and the depletion of cytochrome c from 3T3XS7.2 whole cell extracts. This was confirmed by immunoblot analysis (using both monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies against cytochrome c) and directly, utilizing the peroxidase activity of the covalently bound iron atom in the heme group of cytochrome c and a chemiluminescent substrate, which is activated upon oxidation. The loss of detectable cytochromec also occurs as there are both structural and functional perturbations detected in the mitochondria. Second, complementation of cytosolic extracts, from 3T3XS7.2 cells, with exogenous cytochromec triggers processing of pro-caspases. Third, a mechanism for the release of cytochrome c from the mitochondria and the subsequent activation of caspase-9 and cell death is functional in these cells, as they have been shown to release cytochrome c into the cytosol upon serum withdrawal. Serum withdrawal-induced death in these cells was prevented by expression of 9DN; however, 9DN had no effect on Bcl-XS-induced cell death. Finally, alternative mechanisms for the inhibition of caspase activation were addressed and eliminated. 3T3XS7.2 cells can die by caspase-dependent pathways, as activation of the Fas receptor, serum withdrawal, or transfection with Bax have all been shown to kill in a caspase-dependent manner. These cells have functional apoptosomes and, as we have also demonstrated here, their ATP levels are not depleted, even after prolonged expression of Bcl-XS. Therefore, 3T3XS7.2 cells expressing Bcl-XS have all of the cellular machinery and the fuel to execute the apoptotic pathway, except for cytochrome c. Interestingly, the depletion of cytochrome c appears to be a relatively specific phenomenon as other mitochondrial proteins, each with different localization within the mitochondria, VDAC, Hsp60, and AIF, were not depleted upon expression of Bcl-XS. It is not unreasonable to envision a mechanism present in either the mitochondria or in the cytosol that rapidly degrades or grossly modifies cytochromec released (or when release is anticipated) in an environment otherwise not conducive to triggering programmed cell death. Finally, these studies were initiated with the goal of determining the mechanism of action of Bcl-XS-induced cell death. Thus far we have disproved the activation of caspases as a possible mechanism, and we have also described the novel finding of depletion of cytochromec as a method of inhibiting caspase activation upon Bcl-XS expression. In this study we also addressed another of the proposed mechanisms for Bcl-XS-induced cell death (Fig. 1), that Bcl-XS acts by displacing a pro-death Bcl-2 protein, such as Bax, that contains membrane-spanning domains. To address this model we used the 3T3XS7.2 cells and stable derivatives of these same cells expressing 9DN to determine whether expression of 9DN had a protective effect upon transfection with Bcl-XS or Bax. If Bcl-XS kills by displacing Bax, the protective effects of 9DN observed for Bax-induced death would have also be observed upon transfection with Bcl-XS; however, this was not the case. The lack of protection, by 9DN, from Bcl-XS implies that Bcl-XS does not kill indirectly by the liberation and/or activation of a Bax-like protein. These findings, combined with the fact that Bcl-XS does not possess membrane-spanning domains and, therefore, cannot form membrane-spanning channels, supports a model in which Bcl-XS acts as a dominant negative Bcl-2/Bcl-XL and inhibits the pro-survival function of these proteins. In summary, these findings suggest a novel pathway for cell death induced by a Bcl-2 family member, Bcl-XS, that does not utilize caspases. Additionally, there is evidence to suggest the existence of a novel regulatory mechanism, the depletion of cytochrome c, for the activation of caspases. Such a mechanism may have evolved in eukaryotes to safeguard the cell from an untimely demise upon the accidental release of cytochrome c. It will be interesting to determine what activity is responsible for the degradation of cytochrome c in these cells and to determine whether evidence exists in vivo for such mechanisms of regulating cell death.

The C-terminal extension, comprising two helices connected by a long loop, completely buries the substrate-binding pocket and occludes most of the GSH-binding site. By virtue of the extension being wedged into the active site, mobile regions found in other GSTs such as helices α2 and α4 are no longer very flexible. In the accompanying paper (10Caccuri A.M.

The crystallographic studies demonstrated that the crystals were catalytically active in that they could convert the sulfatase substrate, Msu, into the corresponding GSH conjugate with cleavage of the sulfate group. Surprisingly, there was no evidence that the C-terminal extension moves away from the active site, and it was suggested that a narrow tunnel might widen to allow the passage of substrates and products between the active site and the surrounding solvent. In accordance with these data, all kinetics reported here depict a somewhat primordial catalysis that is rate-limited by the product release in the case of Msu and by a less than optimal chemical step in the case of CDNB. Recently, two kinetic studies on the rat T2-2 enzyme have been published (14Jemth P. Mannervik B. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 9982-9991Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 15Jemth P. Mannervik B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8618-8624Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). In those papers, a hysteretic mechanism has been proposed that involves at least three or four different interconverting enzyme conformers. A different kinetic scenario is described here for the human isoenzyme that displays a peculiar half-site catalysis due to a slow or absent interconversion between two catalytically distinct enzyme populations (or active sites). Msu was synthesized as described by Clapp and Young (16Clapp J.J. Young L. Biochem. J. 1970; 118: 765-771Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). GSH, S-hexylglutathione, CDNB, and 1-fluoro-2,4-dinitrobenzene (FDNB) were Sigma products. His-tagged recombinant hGSTT2-2 and R107A mutant were expressed inEscherichia coli and purified using immobilized metal ion chromatography on a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid matrix (Qiagen) as described previously (13Tan K.-L. Chelvanayagam G. Parker M.W. Board P.G. Biochem. J. 1996; 319: 315-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 17Flanagan J.U. Rossjohn J. Parker M.W. Board P.G. Chelvanayagam G. Protein Sci. 1999; 8: 2205-2212Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Kinetic experiments were carried out at 37 °C in 1 ml of carbonate/phosphate/acetate (50:50:50 μm) buffer (Buffer A) at suitable pH values (between pH 5.0 and pH 10.0), containing variable amounts of GSH (from 0.2 to 100 mm) with fixed and saturating Msu concentration (0.25 mm); the reaction was started by the addition of suitable amounts of hGSTT2-2 or of R107A mutant. The reaction rates were measured spectrophotometrically at 298 nm and at 0.1-s intervals for a total period of 120 s. Initial rates were determined by linear regression analysis. Spontaneous reaction was negligible at all the pH values investigated. Data of velocity versus [S] were analyzed by a rectangular hyperbole equation to yieldV max and K m values for GSH. The Hill equation was evaluated for possible cooperativity. The activity of hGSTT2-2 with CDNB or FDNB was assayed at constant co-substrate concentration (1 mm) and variable GSH concentration in 0.1 m potassium phosphate buffer, pH 6.5, 37 °C. Rapid kinetic experiments were performed on a Applied Photophysics Kinetic spectrometer stopped-flow instrument equipped with a 1-cm light path observation chamber thermostatted at 37 °C. In a typical experiment, hGSTT2-2 or R107A mutant (30 μm), in Buffer A at a suitable pH value, was rapidly mixed with an identical volume of GSH (10 mm) and Msu (0.5 mm) dissolved in the same buffer. The reaction was followed at 298 nm and performed in the 5–10 pH range. Data were fitted to Scheme I, E+S⇒k1EP⇒k2E+P SCHEMEIwhere E is enzyme, S is substrate, and P is product. Acidic constants for the native enzyme were calculated by fitting kinetic data to Equation 1, y=ylim(10−pKa1×10−pH)/[(10−pKa1×10−pKa2)+(10−pKa1×10−pH)+10−2pH]Equation 1 and for R107A mutant by utilizing Equation 2, y=ylim/(1+10(pKa−pH))Equation 2 Moreover, pre-steady state kinetics at different GSH concentrations were performed by rapid mixing of the native enzyme (30 μm) dissolved in buffer A, pH 7.0, with the same volume of buffer containing Msu (0.5 mm) and different amounts of GSH from 0.12 to 20 mm. Data were fitted to Scheme II, E+S⇔koffkonE−S⇒k1E−P⇒k2E+P SCHEMEII In a typical experiment, hGSTT2-2 (30 μm), dissolved in Buffer A, pH 7.0, was rapidly mixed with GSH (4 mm) and Msu (0.2 mm) dissolved in the same buffer at 37 °C. 200 points were collected on a faster time base and successively another 200 points were collected on a slower time base. Time-dependent spectra were reconstructed from single wavelength observations (between 240 and 320 nm) by repetitively changing the wavelength following different reagent mixing steps; a 2-nm increment step and 6-nm bandwidth were utilized. Optical deconvolution of time-dependent spectra sets were performed by means of the software MATLAB (MathWorks, South Natick, MA), running on an Intel Pentium-based personal computer by using singular value decomposition (SVD) in combination with curve fitting algorithms. The matrix of time-dependent spectra (A) is decomposed by SVD into the product of three matrices, A = UXSXVT, where the U columns are the basis spectra, and their time dependence is represented by the V columns. The diagonal values of the S matrix yield the relative occupancies of the basis spectra in the data set. If a data set is contributed by more than one optical transition, deconvolution of the optical components (provided they have different time courses) can be achieved by simultaneously fitting the chosen V columns subset to the kinetic Scheme III (see below). Such best fit of the experimental data to Scheme III, performed using either the program FACSIMILE (AEA, Harwell, UK) or the program GEPASI 3.21 (18Mendes P. Comput. Appl. Biosci. 1993; 9: 563-571PubMed Google Scholar, 19Mendes P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 361-363Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar, 20Mendes P. Kell D.B. Bioinformatics. 1998; 14: 869-883Crossref PubMed Scopus (550) Google Scholar), obtaining essentially identical results in both cases, has been carried out by means of numerical integration, at variable steps, of the ordinary differential equations according to Scheme III. The resulting matrix of the time dependences of the molar fraction of the intermediate species can be used to reconstruct (from the experimental matrix of time-dependent spectra) the spectra of the intermediate species at different times after mixing (21Henry E.R. Hofrichter J. Methods Enzymol. 1992; 210: 129-192Crossref Scopus (614) Google Scholar, 22Hendler R.W. Shrager R.I. J. Biochem. Biophys.

Steady state kinetics of hGSTT2-2 has been analyzed at fixed and saturating Msu concentrations (0.25 mm) and variable GSH concentrations between 0.2 and 100 mm. Experiments were performed at 37 °C and at different pH values between pH 5.0 and 10.0. The dependence of velocity on GSH concentration does not obey the Michaelis-Menten equation, and hGSTT2-2 displays apparent negative cooperativity toward GSH as though the binding of GSH to the first subunit induces a lowering of affinity in the empty subunit. Hill plots, obtained from experiments at various pH values, yield a Hill coefficient ranging from 0.7 to 0.8. This non-Michaelian kinetic behavior is unexpected as the isothermal binding of GSH has been found to be hyperbolic (10Caccuri A.M. Antonini G. Board P.G. Flanagan J. Parker M.W. Paolesse R. Turella P. Federici G. Lo Bello M. Ricci G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 5427-5431Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Thus, this may correspond to a true cooperativity only if the presence of the co-substrate in the active site causes an intersubunit communication that is absent without it. Due to the very high affinity for Msu (K m = 5 μm), it is unclear if hGSTT2-2 displays a cooperative behavior toward this co-substrate. For the sake of simplicity, kinetic data, at variable GSH concentration between 0.2 and 4 mm, were only considered. They can be fit satisfactory to a simple hyperbolic equation that gives a rough estimate of the apparentK m(GSH) ≅ 0.5 mm. This value does not change between pH 5.0 and pH 9.0, showing an increase only at higher pH values. k cat value, calculated at 100 mm GSH, is low (0.15 s−1 at pH 7.0) and scarcely pH-dependent between pH 5.0 and pH 8.0 (Fig. 1 A). Under more alkaline conditions, k cat value increases, reaching a 5-fold increase at pH 10. At this pH, the enzyme is unstable, and in a few minutes it inactivates irreversibly. Secondary plots of 1/k cat andK m/k cat in the presence or absence of the enzymatic product GS-Msu (data not shown) suggest that hGSTT2-2 follows a rapid equilibrium random mechanism like the rat isoenzyme (14Jemth P. Mannervik B. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 9982-9991Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). As a whole, several aspects seem to characterize the hGSTT2-2 steady state kinetics when compared with other human GSTs as follows: (a) very low (at least 100-fold lower)k cat andk cat/K m(GSH)values; (b) the apparent negative cooperativity, also observed in the Alpha and Mu GSTs, but in those enzymes it is probably the consequence of a steady state random kinetic mechanism (24Ivanetich K.M. Goold R.D. Sikakana C.N.T. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1990; 39: 1999-2004Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar); (c) k cat value is pH independent, whereas in human Alpha, Mu, and Pi GSTs (with CDNB as co-substrate) it parallels the deprotonation of the bound GSH (11Caccuri A.M.

Pre-steady state kinetics of hGSTT2-2 have been dissected by means of stopped-flow experiments performed at pH 7.0 and 37 °C. Representative time courses of the enzymatic reaction, obtained at variable GSH concentrations (from 0.06 to 10 mm) and in the presence of saturating Msu (0.25 mm), are shown in Fig.2 B. The early stage of catalysis shows a well defined burst phase of product accumulation followed by a slower, linear phase that corresponds to the product release. The slower portion is almost independent on GSH concentration indicating that the product release occurs at the maximum rate even at low GSH concentrations. The best fit of these kinetic data to the minimal Scheme II (see “Experimental Procedures”) yields apparent microscopic rate constants reported in TableI. It appears thatk on and k off are close to those previously found for the formation of the binary complexE-GSH (10Caccuri A.M. Antonini G. Board P.G. Flanagan J. Parker M.W. Paolesse R. Turella P. Federici G. Lo Bello M. Ricci G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 5427-5431Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Thus, the presence of Msu does not affect the binding of GSH, and this co-substrate interacts with the active site at a higher or similar velocity compared with GSH.Table IStopped-flow kinetic parameters have been calculated by fitting pre-steady state kinetic data at variable GSH concentrations to Scheme IIk on(3 ± 1) × 104 m−1 s−1k off41 ± 8 s−1k 150 ± 20 s−1k 20.6 ± 0.15 s−1 Open table in a new tab When the linear phase following the burst is extrapolated back on they axis, the intercept (π) yields the effective active enzyme concentration, according to π = [E]0 (k 1/(k 1+ k 2))2. In the case of hGSTT2-2, E 0 corresponds to only about 50% of the total enzyme used. This sub-stoichiometric amount of active enzyme has been confirmed by replicate experiments with different enzyme batches, and it seems to be a peculiarity of the human Theta isoenzyme. A second unusual finding is thatk cat calculated above by conventional spectrophotometry (0.15 s−1), if normalized to the effective active enzyme concentration, is 3-fold lower thank 2 (1 s−1). By using longer acquisition times in the stopped flow apparatus (a few seconds after mixing), the rate of product release decreases, so thatk 2 approaches k cat. In other words, the experimental traces given by the stopped-flow apparatus are now comparable to those observed in the conventional spectrophotometer. Thus, after the burst phase that is related tok 1, two subsequent phases characterize the steady state kinetic behavior of T2-2. The first one occurs within 1–1.5 s after mixing (Fig. 2 B); the slower second phase is visible at longer acquisition times (see Fig. 2, A andC). The pH dependence of the pre-steady state kinetics has been studied between pH 5.0 and 10.0 at fixed GSH (5 mm) and Msu (0.25 mm) concentrations. Data were analyzed according to Scheme I (see “Experimental Procedures”). Fig. 1 shows the pH dependence of the pseudo-first order rate constant for product formation (k 1) and for the first order rate constant for product release (k 2) and the pH dependence of the enzyme concentration (E 0) calculated from the π amplitude. Whereas E 0 corresponds to about 50% of the total protein between pH 5.0 and pH 9.0 (Fig.1 D), the pH dependence of k 1 shows a large bell-shaped trend (Fig. 1 B). The best fit of the experimental data to Equation 1 yields an apparent pK a1 = 5.6 ± 0.20 and pK a2 = 9.2 ± 0.20. pK a1 is close to the apparent pK a of the bound GSH (pK a = 6.1), as calculated in the binary complex (10Caccuri A.M. Antonini G. Board P.G. Flanagan J. Parker M.W. Paolesse R. Turella P. Federici G. Lo Bello M. Ricci G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 5427-5431Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The presence of Msu in the active site probably causes a more favorable deprotonation of the bound GSH. The decrease of k 1 above pH 8.0 suggests that at least one protonated residue, with an apparent pK a of 9.2, is involved in optimizing the orientation of the substrate(s) for the chemical step.k 2, which has been calculated within 1 s after mixing, follows a trend similar to that ofk cat, i.e. is pH independent up to pH 8.0, showing a remarkable increase only above pH 9.0 (Fig.1 C). The crystal structure of the Msu complex provides an explanation as to why the product release is rate-limiting; the menaphthyl ring is firmly wedged in the H-site with the C-terminal extension completely blocking access to the surrounding solvent. The Msu complex crystal structure was examined with a view to understanding why product release is greatly accelerated above pH 9. No candidate residues were identified that might be involved in loosening the contacts of the C-terminal extension from the rest of the protein. However, a number of residues were identified in the narrow tunnel that leads from the active site. These residues include His-40, Lys-41, Lys-53, Glu-66, Asp-104, and Cys-105. In addition to these residues, the α-amino group of GSH is another candidate. In each case the residue is in a microenvironment that might sufficiently disturb its pK a to cause the pH-dependent kinetic effect. In summary, the kinetic data support the previous hypothesis that the C-terminal extension does not move to allow the passage of substrates and products, but instead a small tunnel acts as the gateway (8Rossjohn J. McKinstry W.J. Oakley A.J. Verger D. Flanagan J. Chelvanayagam G. Tan K.-L. Board P.G. Parker M.W. Structure. 1997; 6: 309-322Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (139) Google Scholar). In the structure of the Msu complex, Arg-107 interacts with both GSH and the cleaved sulfate ion (8Rossjohn J. McKinstry W.J. Oakley A.J. Verger D. Flanagan J. Chelvanayagam G. Tan K.-L. Board P.G. Parker M.W. Structure. 1997; 6: 309-322Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (139) Google Scholar). In the accompanying paper (10Caccuri A.M. Antonini G. Board P.G. Flanagan J. Parker M.W. Paolesse R. Turella P. Federici G. Lo Bello M. Ricci G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 5427-5431Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), Arg-107 has been shown to play a crucial role in the activation of GSH since mutating this residue causes the pK a of the thiolate anion to shift from 6.1 to 7.8. Steady state kinetics is also modified. For example, between pH 5.0 and pH 8.0, k cat shows a pH dependence that contrasts with the pH invariance of the native enzyme (Fig. 1 A). Stopped-flow experiments demonstrate a well defined burst phase only above pH 7.0, although it is completely absent under more acidic conditions. This means that below pH 7.0, the chemical event becomes too slow, and the product does not accumulate. The pH dependence of k 1 displays an apparent pK a of 8.1 (Fig. 1 B), a value close to the pK a of GSH in the binary complex with this mutant (10Caccuri A.M. Antonini G. Board P.G. Flanagan J. Parker M.W. Paolesse R. Turella P. Federici G. Lo Bello M. Ricci G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 5427-5431Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Thus, the replacement of Arg-107 yields a similar shift of pK a both in the binary and in the ternary complexes of hGSTT2-2. It is likely that the protonated form of Arg-107 plays a role in the chemical step by promoting not only the GSH ionization but also a proper orientation of the substrate. In fact, in the native enzyme, when GSH and Arg-107 are in the ionized form (between pH 7.0 and 8.0),k 1 reaches the limiting value of about 45 s−1. Conversely, the limiting value ofk 1 in R107A under alkaline conditions is only 10 s−1. This value is close to that obtained in the native enzyme at pH 10 when Arg-107 is almost uncharged, and the bound GSH is fully deprotonated. The slight increase of k cat andk 2 in the mutant under alkaline conditions also suggests that replacement of Arg-107 may facilitate the product release (Fig. 1, A and C). It was previously reported that mutation of Arg-107 had a detrimental effect on the sulfatase reaction measured in Tris/HCl, pH 8.3 (17Flanagan J.U. Rossjohn J. Parker M.W. Board P.G. Chelvanayagam G. Protein Sci. 1999; 8: 2205-2212Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Conversely, under alkaline conditions, we found a comparable or even higher activity of the Y107A mutant compared with the wild type enzyme. This may be probably due to the presence, in the buffers utilized, of phosphate which appears to stabilize the Y107A mutant in a more active conformation. A minimal kinetic mechanism that accounts for all pre-steady state and steady state kinetic data is reported in Scheme III. This involves two enzyme populationsE and E′ (slowly or not interconverting and each representing about 50% of the total population) both able to bind and activate GSH but just one competent for a fast catalytic event. The product formation occurs in E at a rate about 100 times faster than it occurs in E′. Product is slowly released from both E and E′, whereas it enters at a high rate resulting in a relevant enzyme inhibition. TableII shows the microscopic rate constants calculated by a global fit of all pre-steady state and steady state kinetic data and GSH binding data to the proposed mechanism. The best fit of the experimental data to Scheme III superimpose well the experimental traces (see Fig. 2) in the large temporal window of 0.001–100 s. The proposed kinetic mechanism accounts for the apparent half-site behavior found in the pre-steady state analysis and also for the apparent cooperativity observed under steady state conditions. This mechanism is compatible either with the existence of two slowly interconverting enzyme populations or with a single dimer population having one subunit more active than the other. Actually, there are extensive contacts in the dimer interface, particularly at the base of the molecule where there are numerous hydrophobic interactions. In comparison to other GSTs the interface is much more extensive and includes the helical towers of the C-terminal domain and the C-terminal tails. These latter elements also form walls of the H-sites (8Rossjohn J. McKinstry W.J. Oakley A.J. Verger D. Flanagan J. Chelvanayagam G. Tan K.-L. Board P.G. Parker M.W. Structure. 1997; 6: 309-322Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (139) Google Scholar). It is thus quite conceivable that communication could exist between the active sites, and this could be the base for a true half-site catalysis as a result of a strong negative cooperativity.Table IIStopped-flow kinetic parameters have been calculated by fitting pre-steady state, steady state kinetic data, and binding data (10Caccuri A.M.

This has been obtained by SVD analysis and best fit of the experimental data to Scheme III as described under the “Experimental Procedures.” Fig.3 A depicts the temporal evolution of the difference spectra (in the range 240–320 nm) obtained after rapid mixing hGSTT2-2 with GSH and Msu. These data, subjected to SVD analysis, were best fit to the proposed Scheme III, employing the microscopic rate constants listed in Table II. The time dependences of the molar fraction of the intermediate species are reported in Fig. 3 B. It is also possible to reconstruct the spectrum of each intermediate species at a given time. Fig.3 C shows representative spectral sets at 0.001, 0.01, 0.1, and 1 s. It can be noted that both ES andE′S are characterized by a peak below 250 nm (the intrinsic instrumental limit did not allow us to follow accurately any optical transition below 250 nm), which may be due to the GSH thiolate. On the contrary, the EP and E′P species show a double peak with a maximum at about 300 nm, which might correspond to the product (P) as it overlaps the spectrum of synthetic GS-Msu adduct (data not shown). It is useful now to look at the relative amount of the different species and their spectral contribution during the approach to the steady state phase. ES and E′S formation is synchronous (in the millisecond time scale) to the GSH-binding event. However, ES reaches a maximum (about 20% of the total) 10 ms after mixing, and it is absent at 100 ms when EP is the prevalent species. E′S reaches a maximum (about 70% of the total) after 30 ms, and it is still present (about 20%) at 1 s after mixing. EP appears early, reaches a maximum after 100 ms and then remains populated at about 95% during the steady state phase. E′P is slowly formed only after 100 ms and reaches a maximum after 1 s. The product release (P) starts only after 50–100 ms and increases during the steady state phase. As a whole, this analysis represents a time-dependent spectral visualization of the proposed mechanism and adds new elements to the traditional kinetic analysis. The good overlap of the deconvoluted spectra with those of the separate species is an intrinsic control of the correct fit of kinetic data to Scheme III. Despite previous reports (13Tan K.-L. Chelvanayagam G. Parker M.W. Board P.G. Biochem. J. 1996; 319: 315-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) in our experimental conditions, we found that hGSTT2-2 has a small but detectable activity with CDNB, one of the best co-substrates for Alpha, Pi, and Mu GSTs. The presence of phosphate seems to be crucial for this activity, and at pH 6.5 and 37 °C, hGSTT2-2 displays ak cat value of 0.07 s−1and a K m(GSH) of about 0.6 mm. Thus its catalytic efficiency,k cat/K m, may be estimated to be 100 s−1m−1, about 1000 times lower than values obtained for the recently evolved GSTs. Pre-steady state kinetic experiments did not reveal any product accumulation before the steady state attainment, so the rate-limiting step in catalysis would be the chemical event or a preceding conformational transition of the ternary complex (27Ricci G. Caccuri A.M. Lo Bello M. Rosato N. Mei G. Nicotra M. Chiessi E. Mazzetti A.P. Federici G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16187-16192Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). By replacing CDNB with its fluoro-analogue, FDNB,k cat increases 40 times. Since spontaneous reaction between FDNB and GSH is 38 times faster than that with CDNB, the chemical step is a reasonable candidate as rate-limiting in catalysis. It is well known that this nucleophilic aromatic substitution occurs via an addition-elimination sequence that involves a short-lived ς-complex (27Ricci G. Caccuri A.M. Lo Bello M. Rosato N. Mei G. Nicotra M. Chiessi E. Mazzetti A.P. Federici G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16187-16192Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). As fluoride is a poorer leaving group than chloride but enhances the electrophilic propensity of the C-1 atom, the ς-complex formation seems to be the rate-contributing event in hGSTT2-2 catalysis with CDNB. The remarkable increase ofk cat with FDNB also indicates that the energy barrier due to a physical event in the catalytic pathway (product release or structural transition) must be much lower than that of the chemical step. This paper presents a series of investigations to dissect the hGSTT2-2 catalytic mechanism, which is complicated by some unusual kinetic properties of this enzyme. A multidisciplinary approach has been found essential to reach a reasonable kinetic model; all steady state and pre-steady state kinetic data reported here are fit well to the kinetic mechanism of Scheme III. Even if more complicated scenarios are also plausible, this mechanism accounts for the apparent negative cooperativity, the apparent half-site behavior of hGSTT2-2, and the peculiar kinetic trend observed in the early stage of catalysis. Arg-107 is crucially involved in GSH activation and in a proper orientation of GSH for catalysis. The protonation of the guanidine side chain is an essential requirement for its contributing role. In addition, the SVD analysis supports the proposed mechanism giving a reasonable spectral visualization of the species occurring along the kinetic pathway. Apart from the obvious interest in elucidating an unusual kinetic mechanism, our data also present an opportunity to compare an enzyme from an “old” GST family like hGSTT2-2 to the “younger” Alpha, Pi, and Mu class GSTs. One crucial difference resides in the structural rigidity of the hGSTT2-2 that may be the origin of most of the kinetic oddities described above. A comparison of the mobility profile of representative GST isoenzymes has been presented in the accompanying paper (10Caccuri A.M. Antonini G. Board P.G. Flanagan J. Parker M.W. Paolesse R. Turella P. Federici G. Lo Bello M. Ricci G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 5427-5431Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). This comparison demonstrates the relative rigidity of the primordial enzyme compared with the more recently evolved GSTs and, in particular, the absence of a sequence of “cold” and “hot” regions along the polypeptide chain. Recently, molecular dynamics simulation data on GSTP1-1 (Pi class) revealed that segmental motions of the protein may play a crucial role in catalysis. GSTP1-1 behaves as a “dancing” enzyme with a breathing involving the helix α2 region and other protein segments that produce a fast alternate opening and closing of the active site (28Stella L. Nicotra M. Ricci G. Rosato N. Di Iorio E. Proteins. 1999; 37: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 29Stella L. Di Iorio E. Nicotra M. Ricci G. Proteins. 1999; 37: 10-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). A dynamic fluorescence study also indicated GSTP1-1 exists as two families of rapidly interconverting conformers with different binding properties (30Stella L. Caccuri A.M. Rosato N. Nicotra M.

The interconversion is, however, very fast (with times slower than nanoseconds but much faster than milliseconds), so that any half-site behavior or sub-stoichiometric working active sites has not been observed. Similarly, in the human A1-1 GST (Alpha class), a rapid transition has been proposed involving motions of the flexible C-terminal segment that partially covers the G-site (31Nieslanik B.S. Dabrowski M.J. Lyon R.P. Atkins W.M. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 6971-6980Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Even the Mu class GST, where the active site is confined by two flexible loops, may display a similar fluctuating accessibility (32Parsons J.F. Xiao G. Gilliland G.L. Armstrong R.N. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 6286-6294Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). On the whole, it appears that the very similar flexibility profiles found in Alpha, Pi, and Mu GSTs (10Caccuri A.M. Antonini G. Board P.G. Flanagan J. Parker M.W. Paolesse R. Turella P. Federici G. Lo Bello M. Ricci G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 5427-5431Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) are not incidental but reflect a precise evolution strategy to enhance the catalytic efficiency of the GST superfamily. How did GSTs evolve toward a more flexible structure? The partial or total deletion of a cumbersome segment like the C-terminal extension of hGSTT2-2, is one possibility, even though it causes a loss of the sulfatase activity. Replacement of crucial residues involved in electrostatic interactions may be a second possibility. For example, Arg-107 is likely involved in an electrostatic interaction with Asp-104, and its replacement by Ala induces an increased flexibility of the active site causing an improvement of the GSH-binding properties (10Caccuri A.M. Antonini G. Board P.G. Flanagan J. Parker M.W. Paolesse R. Turella P. Federici G. Lo Bello M. Ricci G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 5427-5431Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). This mutation also favors the release of product as evidenced by the slightly higher values of k 2 of the mutant (see Fig. 1). However Arg-107 is crucially involved in the proper orientation and activation of GSH, so it was strictly conserved during the natural intra-class evolution of this enzyme. What we found for the hGSTT2-2 catalysis using a small co-substrate like CDNB also indicates that other evolutionary targets may have been pursued. In fact the chemical event is largely rate-limiting in the CDNB case; the active site is rather large and a small substrate like CDNB could not be optimally orientated in such a site. The optimization in catalysis could be achieved by a refinement of the substrate orientation in the active site. We thank Prof. M. Coletta for helpful discussions."
