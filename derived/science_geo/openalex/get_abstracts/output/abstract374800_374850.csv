https://openalex.org/W2159422401,"Levels of circulating glucose are tightly regulated. To identify new loci influencing glycemic traits, we performed meta-analyses of 21 genome-wide association studies informative for fasting glucose, fasting insulin and indices of beta-cell function (HOMA-B) and insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) in up to 46,186 nondiabetic participants. Follow-up of 25 loci in up to 76,558 additional subjects identified 16 loci associated with fasting glucose and HOMA-B and two loci associated with fasting insulin and HOMA-IR. These include nine loci newly associated with fasting glucose (in or near ADCY5, MADD, ADRA2A, CRY2, FADS1, GLIS3, SLC2A2, PROX1 and C2CD4B) and one influencing fasting insulin and HOMA-IR (near IGF1). We also demonstrated association of ADCY5, PROX1, GCK, GCKR and DGKB-TMEM195 with type 2 diabetes. Within these loci, likely biological candidate genes influence signal transduction, cell proliferation, development, glucose-sensing and circadian regulation. Our results demonstrate that genetic studies of glycemic traits can identify type 2 diabetes risk loci, as well as loci containing gene variants that are associated with a modest elevation in glucose levels but are not associated with overt diabetes."
https://openalex.org/W2024373518,"Marco Marra and colleagues identify somatic mutations in EZH2 in diffuse large B-cell lymphomas and follicular lymphomas. EZH2 is a histone methyltransferase that participates in trimethylation of H3 Lys27 (H3K27) as part of the PRC2 complex. The mutations alter a single tyrosine residue in the SET domain of EZH2 and reduce the ability of PRC2 to trimethylate H3K27 in vitro. Follicular lymphoma (FL) and the GCB subtype of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) derive from germinal center B cells1. Targeted resequencing studies have revealed mutations in various genes encoding proteins in the NF-κB pathway2,3 that contribute to the activated B-cell (ABC) DLBCL subtype, but thus far few GCB-specific mutations have been identified4. Here we report recurrent somatic mutations affecting the polycomb-group oncogene5 EZH2, which encodes a histone methyltransferase responsible for trimethylating Lys27 of histone H3 (H3K27). After the recent discovery of mutations in KDM6A (UTX), which encodes the histone H3K27me3 demethylase UTX, in several cancer types6, EZH2 is the second histone methyltransferase gene found to be mutated in cancer. These mutations, which result in the replacement of a single tyrosine in the SET domain of the EZH2 protein (Tyr641), occur in 21.7% of GCB DLBCLs and 7.2% of FLs and are absent from ABC DLBCLs. Our data are consistent with the notion that EZH2 proteins with mutant Tyr641 have reduced enzymatic activity in vitro."

https://openalex.org/W1999902156,"Following skeletal muscle damage, a population of resident fibro/adipogenic progenitors (FAP) initiates proliferation, resulting in the generation of ectopic white fat but not myofibres. FAPs enhance the differentiation of the myogenic progenitors involved in muscle regeneration. Efficient tissue regeneration is dependent on the coordinated responses of multiple cell types. Here, we describe a new subpopulation of fibro/adipogenic progenitors (FAPs) resident in muscle tissue but arising from a distinct developmental lineage. Transplantation of purified FAPs results in the generation of ectopic white fat when delivered subcutaneously or intramuscularly in a model of fatty infiltration, but not in healthy muscle, suggesting that the environment controls their engraftment. These cells are quiescent in intact muscle but proliferate efficiently in response to damage. FAPs do not generate myofibres, but enhance the rate of differentiation of primary myogenic progenitors in co-cultivation experiments. In summary, FAPs expand upon damage to provide a transient source of pro-differentiation signals for proliferating myogenic progenitors."

https://openalex.org/W2134928825,"Humans are colonized by a large and diverse bacterial flora (the microbiota) essential for the development of the gut immune system. A broader role for the microbiota as a major modulator of systemic immunity has been proposed; however, evidence and a mechanism for this role have remained elusive. We show that the microbiota are a source of peptidoglycan that systemically primes the innate immune system, enhancing killing by bone marrow-derived neutrophils of two major pathogens: Streptococcus pneumoniae and Staphylococcus aureus. This requires signaling via the pattern recognition receptor nucleotide-binding, oligomerization domain-containing protein-1 (Nod1, which recognizes meso-diaminopimelic acid (mesoDAP)-containing peptidoglycan found predominantly in Gram-negative bacteria), but not Nod2 (which detects peptidoglycan found in Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria) or Toll-like receptor 4 (Tlr4, which recognizes lipopolysaccharide). We show translocation of peptidoglycan from the gut to neutrophils in the bone marrow and show that peptidoglycan concentrations in sera correlate with neutrophil function. In vivo administration of Nod1 ligands is sufficient to restore neutrophil function after microbiota depletion. Nod1(-/-) mice are more susceptible than wild-type mice to early pneumococcal sepsis, demonstrating a role for Nod1 in priming innate defenses facilitating a rapid response to infection. These data establish a mechanism for systemic immunomodulation by the microbiota and highlight potential adverse consequences of microbiota disruption by broad-spectrum antibiotics on innate immune defense to infection."
https://openalex.org/W2028860972,"Delayed myeloid engraftment after cord blood transplantation (CBT) is thought to result from inadequate numbers of progenitor cells in the graft and is associated with increased early transplant-related morbidity and mortality. New culture strategies that increase the number of cord blood progenitors capable of rapid myeloid engraftment after CBT would allow more widespread use of this stem cell source for transplantation. Here we report the development of a clinically relevant Notch-mediated ex vivo expansion system for human CD34(+) cord blood progenitors that results in a marked increase in the absolute number of stem/progenitor cells, including those capable of enhanced repopulation in the marrow of immunodeficient nonobese diabetic-severe combined immunodeficient (NOD-SCID) mice. Furthermore, when cord blood progenitors expanded ex vivo in the presence of Notch ligand were infused in a clinical setting after a myeloablative preparative regimen for stem cell transplantation, the time to neutrophil recovery was substantially shortened. To our knowledge, this is the first instance of rapid engraftment derived from ex vivo expanded stem/progenitor cells in humans."
https://openalex.org/W2074410038,"Two genome-wide RNA interference screens published in this issue identify human host factors required for influenza A virus replication in lung epithelia cell lines. König et al. identify 295 host genes required for influenza replication. Of those, 219 are required for efficient wild-type virus growth, and 23 are required for viral entry. Karlas et al. report the discovery of 287 host genes influencing virus replication. An independent assay confirmed 168 hits (59%) inhibiting either the endemic H1N1 (119 hits) or the current pandemic swine-origin (121 hits) influenza A virus strains, with an overlap of 60%. These studies should provide a number of potential targets for host factor-directed antivirals for treatment of influenza viral infection. High mutation rates in the influenza A virus facilitate the generation of viral escape mutants, rendering vaccines and drugs potentially ineffective, but targeting host cell determinants could prevent viral escape. Here, 287 human host cell genes influencing influenza A virus replication are found using a genome-wide RNA interference screen. An independent assay is then used to investigate overlap between genes necessary for different viral strains. Influenza A virus, being responsible for seasonal epidemics and reoccurring pandemics, represents a worldwide threat to public health1. High mutation rates facilitate the generation of viral escape mutants, rendering vaccines and drugs directed against virus-encoded targets potentially ineffective2. In contrast, targeting host cell determinants temporarily dispensable for the host but crucial for virus replication could prevent viral escape. Here we report the discovery of 287 human host cell genes influencing influenza A virus replication in a genome-wide RNA interference (RNAi) screen. Using an independent assay we confirmed 168 hits (59%) inhibiting either the endemic H1N1 (119 hits) or the current pandemic swine-origin (121 hits) influenza A virus strains, with an overlap of 60%. Notably, a subset of these common hits was also essential for replication of a highly pathogenic avian H5N1 strain. In-depth analyses of several factors provided insights into their infection stage relevance. Notably, SON DNA binding protein (SON)3 was found to be important for normal trafficking of influenza virions to late endosomes early in infection. We also show that a small molecule inhibitor of CDC-like kinase 1 (CLK1)4 reduces influenza virus replication by more than two orders of magnitude, an effect connected with impaired splicing of the viral M2 messenger RNA. Furthermore, influenza-virus-infected p27-/- (cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1B; Cdkn1b) mice accumulated significantly lower viral titres in the lung, providing in vivo evidence for the importance of this gene. Thus, our results highlight the potency of genome-wide RNAi screening for the dissection of virus–host interactions and the identification of drug targets for a broad range of influenza viruses."
https://openalex.org/W2153554912,"Richard Watanabe and colleagues of the MAGIC consortium report meta-analyses of genome-wide association studies to glucose levels two hours after an oral glucose challenge. They identify variants in GIPR associated with glucose and insulin responses. Glucose levels 2 h after an oral glucose challenge are a clinical measure of glucose tolerance used in the diagnosis of type 2 diabetes. We report a meta-analysis of nine genome-wide association studies (n = 15,234 nondiabetic individuals) and a follow-up of 29 independent loci (n = 6,958–30,620). We identify variants at the GIPR locus associated with 2-h glucose level (rs10423928, β (s.e.m.) = 0.09 (0.01) mmol/l per A allele, P = 2.0 × 10−15). The GIPR A-allele carriers also showed decreased insulin secretion (n = 22,492; insulinogenic index, P = 1.0 × 10−17; ratio of insulin to glucose area under the curve, P = 1.3 × 10−16) and diminished incretin effect (n = 804; P = 4.3 × 10−4). We also identified variants at ADCY5 (rs2877716, P = 4.2 × 10−16), VPS13C (rs17271305, P = 4.1 × 10−8), GCKR (rs1260326, P = 7.1 × 10−11) and TCF7L2 (rs7903146, P = 4.2 × 10−10) associated with 2-h glucose. Of the three newly implicated loci (GIPR, ADCY5 and VPS13C), only ADCY5 was found to be associated with type 2 diabetes in collaborating studies (n = 35,869 cases, 89,798 controls, OR = 1.12, 95% CI 1.09–1.15, P = 4.8 × 10−18)."
https://openalex.org/W2098888044,"Neutrophil elastase speeds up the progression of lung cancer by degrading insulin receptor substrate-1 and thereby phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase. This is the first description of a secreted proteinase gaining access to the inside of a cell to alter intracellular signaling ( pages 161–163 ). Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death worldwide1. Recent data suggest that tumor-associated inflammatory cells may modify lung tumor growth and invasiveness2,3. To determine the role of neutrophil elastase (encoded by Elane) on tumor progression, we used the loxP-Stop-loxP K-rasG12D (LSL–K-ras) model of mouse lung adenocarcinoma4 to generate LSL–K-ras-Elane−/− mice. Tumor burden was markedly reduced in LSL–K-ras-Elane−/− mice at all time points after induction of mutant K-ras expression. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis showed that whereas all LSL–K-ras-Elane+/+ mice died, none of the mice lacking neutrophil elastase died. Neutrophil elastase directly induced tumor cell proliferation in both human and mouse lung adenocarcinomas by gaining access to an endosomal compartment within tumor cells, where it degraded insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1). Immunoprecipitation studies showed that, as neutrophil elastase degraded IRS-1, there was increased interaction between phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) and the potent mitogen platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR), thereby skewing the PI3K axis toward tumor cell proliferation. The inverse relationship identified between neutrophil elastase and IRS-1 in LSL–K-ras mice was also identified in human lung adenocarcinomas, thus translating these findings to human disease. This study identifies IRS-1 as a key regulator of PI3K within malignant cells. Additionally, to our knowledge, this is the first description of a secreted proteinase gaining access to the inside of a cell and altering intracellular signaling."

https://openalex.org/W1979162895,"Improved affinity for the neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn) is known to extend antibody half-life in vivo. However, this has never been linked with enhanced therapeutic efficacy. We tested whether antibodies with half-lives extended up to fivefold in human (h)FcRn transgenic mice and threefold in cynomolgus monkeys retain efficacy at longer dosing intervals. We observed that prolonged exposure due to FcRn-mediated enhancement of half-life improved antitumor activity of Fc-engineered antibodies in an hFcRn/Rag1(-/-) mouse model. This bridges the demand for dosing convenience with the clinical necessity of maintaining efficacy."
https://openalex.org/W2122682542,"Despite the need for new psychoactive drugs, there are few robust approaches for discovering novel neuroactive molecules. Development of a behavior-based high-throughput screen in zebrafish led to the discovery of molecules with neurological effects. Translating the complex behavioral phenotypes elicited by compounds into a simple barcode enabled identification of their mechanism of action. Neuroactive small molecules are indispensable tools for treating mental illnesses and dissecting nervous system function. However, it has been difficult to discover novel neuroactive drugs. Here, we describe a high-throughput, behavior-based approach to neuroactive small molecule discovery in the zebrafish. We used automated screening assays to evaluate thousands of chemical compounds and found that diverse classes of neuroactive molecules caused distinct patterns of behavior. These 'behavioral barcodes' can be used to rapidly identify new psychotropic chemicals and to predict their molecular targets. For example, we identified new acetylcholinesterase and monoamine oxidase inhibitors using phenotypic comparisons and computational techniques. By combining high-throughput screening technologies with behavioral phenotyping in vivo, behavior-based chemical screens can accelerate the pace of neuroactive drug discovery and provide small-molecule tools for understanding vertebrate behavior."
https://openalex.org/W2089013147,"Progenitor cells maintain self-renewing tissues throughout life by sustaining their capacity for proliferation while suppressing cell cycle exit and terminal differentiation. DNA methylation provides a potential epigenetic mechanism for the cellular memory needed to preserve the somatic progenitor state through repeated cell divisions. DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1) maintains DNA methylation patterns after cellular replication. Although dispensable for embryonic stem cell maintenance, the role for DNMT1 in maintaining the progenitor state in constantly replenished somatic tissues, such as mammalian epidermis, is unclear. Here we show that DNMT1 is essential for epidermal progenitor cell function. DNMT1 protein was found enriched in undifferentiated cells, where it was required to retain proliferative stamina and suppress differentiation. In tissue, DNMT1 depletion led to exit from the progenitor cell compartment, premature differentiation and eventual tissue loss. Genome-wide analysis showed that a significant portion of epidermal differentiation gene promoters were methylated in self-renewing conditions but were subsequently demethylated during differentiation. Furthermore, UHRF1 (refs 9, 10), a component of the DNA methylation machinery that targets DNMT1 to hemi-methylated DNA, is also necessary to suppress premature differentiation and sustain proliferation. In contrast, Gadd45A and B, which promote active DNA demethylation, are required for full epidermal differentiation gene induction. These data demonstrate that proteins involved in the dynamic regulation of DNA methylation patterns are required for progenitor maintenance and self-renewal in mammalian somatic tissue."

https://openalex.org/W2048376977,"James et al. describe a method for efficient differentiation of human embryonic stem cells into endothelial cells using TGFβ inhibition. Sustained expansion and maintenance of endothelial cells is shown to depend on expression of the vascular transcription factor Id1. Previous efforts to differentiate human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) into endothelial cells have not achieved sustained expansion and stability of vascular cells. To define vasculogenic developmental pathways and enhance differentiation, we used an endothelial cell–specific VE-cadherin promoter driving green fluorescent protein (GFP) (hVPr-GFP) to screen for factors that promote vascular commitment. In phase 1 of our method, inhibition of transforming growth factor (TGF)β at day 7 of differentiation increases hVPr-GFP+ cells by tenfold. In phase 2, TGFβ inhibition maintains the proliferation and vascular identity of purified endothelial cells, resulting in a net 36-fold expansion of endothelial cells in homogenous monolayers, which exhibited a transcriptional profile of Id1highVEGFR2highVE-cadherin+ ephrinB2+. Using an Id1-YFP hESC reporter line, we showed that TGFβ inhibition sustains Id1 expression in hESC-derived endothelial cells and that Id1 is required for increased proliferation and preservation of endothelial cell commitment. Our approach provides a serum-free method for differentiation and long-term maintenance of hESC-derived endothelial cells at a scale relevant to clinical application."

https://openalex.org/W2080413744,"Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) is causally linked to several acquired immune deficiency syndrome-related malignancies, including Kaposi's sarcoma, primary effusion lymphoma (PEL) and a subset of multicentric Castleman's disease. Control of viral lytic replication is essential for KSHV latency, evasion of the host immune system and induction of tumours. Here, we show that deletion of a 14 microRNA (miRNA) cluster from the KSHV genome significantly enhances viral lytic replication as a result of reduced NF-kappaB activity. The miRNA cluster regulates the NF-kappaB pathway by reducing expression of IkappaBalpha protein, an inhibitor of NF-kappaB complexes. Computational and miRNA seed mutagenesis analyses were used to identify KSHV miR-K1, which directly regulates the IkappaBalpha protein level by targeting the 3'UTR of its transcript. Expression of miR-K1 is sufficient to rescue NF-kappaB activity and inhibit viral lytic replication, whereas inhibition of miR-K1 in KSHV-infected PEL cells has the opposite effect. Thus, KSHV encodes an miRNA to control viral replication by activating the NF-kappaB pathway. These results demonstrate an important role for KSHV miRNAs in regulating viral latency and lytic replication by manipulating the host survival pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2106473601,"SET domain methyltransferases deposit methyl marks on specific histone tail lysine residues and play a major role in epigenetic regulation of gene transcription. We solved the structures of the catalytic domains of GLP, G9a, Suv39H2 and PRDM2, four of the eight known human H3K9 methyltransferases in their apo conformation or in complex with the methyl donating cofactor, and peptide substrates. We analyzed the structural determinants for methylation state specificity, and designed a G9a mutant able to tri-methylate H3K9. We show that the I-SET domain acts as a rigid docking platform, while induced-fit of the Post-SET domain is necessary to achieve a catalytically competent conformation. We also propose a model where long-range electrostatics bring enzyme and histone substrate together, while the presence of an arginine upstream of the target lysine is critical for binding and specificity.

https://openalex.org/W2067358025,"Smallpox was eradicated by vaccination with a related poxvirus, vaccinia virus, which was applied to superficially injured skin in a process called scarification. Recombinant poxvirus–based vaccines are attractive candidates for protecting against a number of different infections, but they are nowadays usually administered intramuscularly. Thomas Kupper and his colleagues now show that the traditional route of administration, scarification, enables poxvirus-based vaccines to mediate more potent immunity compared with the intramuscular route. In particular, scarification with the poxvirus vaccines induced the sort of immune responses that are required for protection of distant tissues, including the lung mucosa. Variola major (smallpox) infection claimed hundreds of millions lives before it was eradicated by a simple vaccination strategy: epicutaneous application of the related orthopoxvirus vaccinia virus (VACV) to superficially injured skin (skin scarification, s.s.)1. However, the remarkable success of this strategy was attributed to the immunogenicity of VACV rather than to the unique mode of vaccine delivery. We now show that VACV immunization via s.s., but not conventional injection routes, is essential for the generation of superior T cell–mediated immune responses that provide complete protection against subsequent challenges, independent of neutralizing antibodies. Skin-resident effector memory T cells (TEM cells) provide complete protection against cutaneous challenge, whereas protection against lethal respiratory challenge requires both respiratory mucosal TEM cells and central memory T cells (TCM cells). Vaccination with recombinant VACV (rVACV) expressing a tumor antigen was protective against tumor challenge only if delivered via the s.s. route; it was ineffective if delivered by hypodermic injection. The clinically safer nonreplicative modified vaccinia Ankara virus (MVA) also generated far superior protective immunity when delivered via the s.s. route compared to intramuscular (i.m.) injection as used in MVA clinical trials. Thus, delivery of rVACV-based vaccines, including MVA vaccines, through physically disrupted epidermis has clear-cut advantages over conventional vaccination via hypodermic injection."

In contrast, the role of DNA methylation, another well-characterized epigenetic mark, is unknown. In order to examine whether human cardiomyopathy of different etiologies are connected by a unifying pattern of DNA methylation pattern, we undertook profiling with ischaemic and idiopathic end-stage cardiomyopathic left ventricular (LV) explants from patients who had undergone cardiac transplantation compared to normal control. We performed a preliminary analysis using methylated-DNA immunoprecipitation-chip (MeDIP-chip), validated differential methylation loci by bisulfite-(BS) PCR and high throughput sequencing, and identified 3 angiogenesis-related genetic loci that were differentially methylated. Using quantitative RT-PCR, we found that the expression of these genes differed significantly between CM hearts and normal control (p<0.01). Moreover, for each individual LV tissue, differential methylation showed a predicted correlation to differential expression of the corresponding gene. Thus, differential DNA methylation exists in human cardiomyopathy. In this series of heterogeneous cardiomyopathic LV explants, differential DNA methylation was found in at least 3 angiogenesis-related genes. While in other systems, changes in DNA methylation at specific genomic loci usually precede changes in the expression of corresponding genes, our current findings in cardiomyopathy merit further investigation to determine whether DNA methylation changes play a causative role in the progression of heart failure."
https://openalex.org/W2042684628,"This article describes the discovery of a set of biologically-driven semantic dimensions underlying the neural representation of concrete nouns, and then demonstrates how a resulting theory of noun representation can be used to identify simple thoughts through their fMRI patterns. We use factor analysis of fMRI brain imaging data to reveal the biological representation of individual concrete nouns like apple, in the absence of any pictorial stimuli. From this analysis emerge three main semantic factors underpinning the neural representation of nouns naming physical objects, which we label manipulation, shelter, and eating. Each factor is neurally represented in 3-4 different brain locations that correspond to a cortical network that co-activates in non-linguistic tasks, such as tool use pantomime for the manipulation factor. Several converging methods, such as the use of behavioral ratings of word meaning and text corpus characteristics, provide independent evidence of the centrality of these factors to the representations. The factors are then used with machine learning classifier techniques to show that the fMRI-measured brain representation of an individual concrete noun like apple can be identified with good accuracy from among 60 candidate words, using only the fMRI activity in the 16 locations associated with these factors. To further demonstrate the generativity of the proposed account, a theory-based model is developed to predict the brain activation patterns for words to which the algorithm has not been previously exposed. The methods, findings, and theory constitute a new approach of using brain activity for understanding how object concepts are represented in the mind."
https://openalex.org/W2113764519,"Degeneration of photoreceptors is a common feature of ciliopathies, owing to the importance of the specialized ciliary structure of these cells. Mutations in AHI1, which encodes a cilium-localized protein, have been shown to cause a form of Joubert syndrome that is highly penetrant for retinal degeneration. We show that Ahi1-null mice fail to form retinal outer segments and have abnormal distribution of opsin throughout their photoreceptors. Apoptotic cell death of photoreceptors occurs rapidly between 2 and 4 weeks of age in these mice and is significantly (P = 0.00175 and 0.00613) delayed by a reduced dosage of opsin. This phenotype also shows dosage-sensitive genetic interactions with Nphp1, another ciliopathy-related gene. Although it is not a primary cause of retinal blindness in humans, we show that an allele of AHI1 is associated with a more than sevenfold increase in relative risk of retinal degeneration within a cohort of individuals with the hereditary kidney disease nephronophthisis. Our data support context-specific roles for AHI1 as a contributor to retinopathy and show that AHI1 may explain a proportion of the variability in retinal phenotypes observed in nephronophthisis."
https://openalex.org/W2030863850,"The metazoan nuclear pore complex (NPC) disassembles during mitosis, and many of its constituents distribute onto spindles and kinetochores, including the Nup107-160 sub-complex. We have found that Nup107-160 interacts with the gamma-tubulin ring complex (gamma-TuRC), an essential and conserved microtubule nucleator, and recruits gamma-TuRC to unattached kinetochores. The unattached kinetochores nucleate microtubules in a manner that is regulated by Ran GTPase; such microtubules contribute to the formation of kinetochore fibres (k-fibres), microtubule bundles connecting kinetochores to spindle poles. Our data indicate that Nup107-160 and gamma-TuRC act cooperatively to promote spindle assembly through microtubule nucleation at kinetochores: HeLa cells lacking Nup107-160 or gamma-TuRC were profoundly deficient in kinetochore-associated microtubule nucleation. Moreover, co-precipitated Nup107-160- gamma-TuRC complexes nucleated microtubule formation in assays using purified tubulin. Although Ran did not regulate microtubule nucleation by gamma-TuRC alone, Nup107-160-gamma-TuRC complexes required Ran-GTP for microtubule nucleation. Collectively, our observations show that Nup107-160 promotes spindle assembly through Ran-GTP-regulated nucleation of microtubules by gamma-TuRC at kinetochores, and reveal a relationship between nucleoporins and the microtubule cytoskeleton."
https://openalex.org/W2032629746,"The metaphase-anaphase transition is orchestrated through proteolysis of numerous proteins by a ubiquitin protein ligase called the anaphase-promoting complex or cyclosome (APC/C). A crucial aspect of this process is sister chromatid separation, which is thought to be mediated by separase, a thiol protease activated by the APC/C. Separase cleaves cohesin, a ring-shaped complex that entraps sister DNAs. It is a matter of debate whether cohesin-independent forces also contribute to sister chromatid cohesion. Using 4D live-cell imaging of Drosophila melanogaster syncytial embryos blocked in metaphase (via APC/C inhibition), we show that artificial cohesin cleavage is sufficient to trigger chromosome disjunction. This is nevertheless insufficient for correct chromosome segregation. Kinetochore-microtubule attachments are rapidly destabilized by the loss of tension caused by cohesin cleavage in the presence of high Cdk1 (cyclin-dependent kinase 1) activity, as occurs when the APC/C cannot destroy mitotic cyclins. Metaphase chromosomes undergo a bona fide anaphase when cohesin cleavage is combined with Cdk1 inhibition. We conclude that only two key events, opening of cohesin rings and downregulation of Cdk1, are sufficient to drive proper segregation of chromosomes in anaphase."
https://openalex.org/W2028437994,"During refinement of inhibitory inputs to the lateral superior olive (LSO), terminals in the medial nucleus of the trapezoid body express VGLUT3 and co-release glutamate with glycine or GABA. Using mice lacking VGLUT3, the authors show impaired refinement of inhibitory inputs to the LSO and degraded tonotopic precision. Many nonglutamatergic synaptic terminals in the mammalian brain contain the vesicular glutamate transporter 3 (VGLUT3), indicating that they co-release the excitatory neurotransmitter glutamate. However, the functional role of glutamate co-transmission at these synapses is poorly understood. In the auditory system, VGLUT3 expression and glutamate co-transmission are prominent in a developing GABA/glycinergic sound-localization pathway. We found that mice with a genetic deletion of Vglut3 (also known as Slc17a8) had disrupted glutamate co-transmission and severe impairment in the refinement of this inhibitory pathway. Specifically, loss of glutamate co-transmission disrupted synaptic silencing and the strengthening of GABA/glycinergic connections that normally occur with maturation. Functional mapping studies further revealed that these deficits markedly degraded the precision of tonotopy in this inhibitory auditory pathway. These results indicate that glutamate co-transmission is crucial for the synaptic reorganization and topographic specification of a developing inhibitory circuit."
https://openalex.org/W2038048096,"Colonic bacteria, exemplified by Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, play a key role in maintaining human health by harnessing large families of glycoside hydrolases (GHs) to exploit dietary polysaccharides and host glycans as nutrients. Such GH family expansion is exemplified by the 23 family GH92 glycosidases encoded by the B. thetaiotaomicron genome. Here we show that these are alpha-mannosidases that act via a single displacement mechanism to utilize host N-glycans. The three-dimensional structure of two GH92 mannosidases defines a family of two-domain proteins in which the catalytic center is located at the domain interface, providing acid (glutamate) and base (aspartate) assistance to hydrolysis in a Ca(2+)-dependent manner. The three-dimensional structures of the GH92s in complex with inhibitors provide insight into the specificity, mechanism and conformational itinerary of catalysis. Ca(2+) plays a key catalytic role in helping distort the mannoside away from its ground-state (4)C(1) chair conformation toward the transition state."
https://openalex.org/W2053311055,"Enhancement of γ-aminobutyric acid type A receptor (GABAAR)-mediated inhibition is a property of most general anesthetics and a candidate for a molecular mechanism of anesthesia. Intravenous anesthetics, including etomidate, propofol, barbiturates, and neuroactive steroids, as well as volatile anesthetics and long-chain alcohols, all enhance GABAAR function at anesthetic concentrations. The implied existence of a receptor site for anesthetics on the GABAAR protein was supported by identification, using photoaffinity labeling, of a binding site for etomidate within the GABAAR transmembrane domain at the β-α subunit interface; the etomidate analog [3H]azietomidate photolabeled in a pharmacologically specific manner two amino acids, α1Met-236 in the M1 helix and βMet-286 in the M3 helix (Li, G. D., Chiara, D. C., Sawyer, G. W., Husain, S. S., Olsen, R. W., and Cohen, J. B. (2006) J. Neurosci. 26, 11599–11605). Here, we use [3H]azietomidate photolabeling of bovine brain GABAARs to determine whether other structural classes of anesthetics interact with the etomidate binding site. Photolabeling was inhibited by anesthetic concentrations of propofol, barbiturates, and the volatile agent isoflurane, at low millimolar concentrations, but not by octanol or ethanol. Inhibition by barbiturates, which was pharmacologically specific and stereospecific, and by propofol was only partial, consistent with allosteric interactions, whereas isoflurane inhibition was nearly complete, apparently competitive. Protein sequencing showed that propofol inhibited to the same extent the photolabeling of α1Met-236 and βMet-286. These results indicate that several classes of general anesthetics modulate etomidate binding to the GABAAR: isoflurane binds directly to the site with millimolar affinity, whereas propofol and barbiturates inhibit binding but do not bind in a mutually exclusive manner with etomidate. Enhancement of γ-aminobutyric acid type A receptor (GABAAR)-mediated inhibition is a property of most general anesthetics and a candidate for a molecular mechanism of anesthesia. Intravenous anesthetics, including etomidate, propofol, barbiturates, and neuroactive steroids, as well as volatile anesthetics and long-chain alcohols, all enhance GABAAR function at anesthetic concentrations. The implied existence of a receptor site for anesthetics on the GABAAR protein was supported by identification, using photoaffinity labeling, of a binding site for etomidate within the GABAAR transmembrane domain at the β-α subunit interface; the etomidate analog [3H]azietomidate photolabeled in a pharmacologically specific manner two amino acids, α1Met-236 in the M1 helix and βMet-286 in the M3 helix (Li, G. D., Chiara, D. C., Sawyer, G. W., Husain, S. S., Olsen, R. W., and Cohen, J. B. (2006) J. Neurosci. 26, 11599–11605). Here, we use [3H]azietomidate photolabeling of bovine brain GABAARs to determine whether other structural classes of anesthetics interact with the etomidate binding site. Photolabeling was inhibited by anesthetic concentrations of propofol, barbiturates, and the volatile agent isoflurane, at low millimolar concentrations, but not by octanol or ethanol. Inhibition by barbiturates, which was pharmacologically specific and stereospecific, and by propofol was only partial, consistent with allosteric interactions, whereas isoflurane inhibition was nearly complete, apparently competitive. Protein sequencing showed that propofol inhibited to the same extent the photolabeling of α1Met-236 and βMet-286. These results indicate that several classes of general anesthetics modulate etomidate binding to the GABAAR: isoflurane binds directly to the site with millimolar affinity, whereas propofol and barbiturates inhibit binding but do not bind in a mutually exclusive manner with etomidate."
https://openalex.org/W2107019090,"The tetronate ring appears in several natural products, but the biosynthetic path to this structure has proven elusive. Reconstitution of a polyketide assembly line and in vitro assays with a chemically synthesized intermediate now point to a single enzyme as catalyzing ring formation. The protein phosphatase inhibitor RK-682 is one of a number of potentially valuable tetronate polyketide natural products. Understanding how the tetronate ring is formed has been frustrated by the inaccessibility of the putative substrates. We report the heterologous expression of rk genes in Saccharopolyspora erythraea and reconstitution of the RK-682 pathway using recombinant enzymes, and we show that RkD is the enzyme required for RK-682 formation from acyl carrier protein–bound substrates."

Using RNAi screening, metabolic profiling and small-molecule probes, we discovered that the knockdown of three metabolic enzymes-phosphoglycerate kinase (Pgk1), hexose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (H6pd) and ATP citrate lyase (Acl)-induces differentiation of mouse C2C12 myoblasts even in the presence of mitogens. These enzymes and the pathways they regulate provide new targets for the control of myogenic differentiation in myoblasts and rhabdomyosarcoma cells."
https://openalex.org/W2091920457,"Although rare, small molecules that covalently bind one non-enzyme protein could have important applications—for instance, as imaging and therapeutic agents. A newly designed ligand that selectively binds to transthyretin and reacts chemoselectively with a lysine provides enhanced efficacy over a noncovalent analog in inhibiting amyloid fibril formation. A small molecule that could bind selectively to and then react chemoselectively with a non-enzyme protein in a complex biological fluid, such as blood, could have numerous practical applications. Herein, we report a family of designed stilbenes that selectively and covalently modify the prominent plasma protein transthyretin in preference to more than 4,000 other human plasma proteins. They react chemoselectively with only one of eight lysine ε-amino groups within transthyretin. The crystal structure confirms the expected binding orientation of the stilbene substructure and the anticipated conjugating amide bond. These covalent transthyretin kinetic stabilizers exhibit superior amyloid inhibition potency compared to their noncovalent counterparts, and they prevent cytotoxicity associated with amyloidogenesis. Though there are a few prodrugs that, upon metabolic activation, react with a cysteine residue inactivating a specific non-enzyme, we are unaware of designed small molecules that react with one lysine ε-amine within a specific non-enzyme protein in a complex biological fluid."
https://openalex.org/W2075797340,"Aggregation-prone proteins often misfold into multiple distinct amyloid conformations that dictate different physiological impacts. Although amyloid formation is triggered by a transient nucleus, the mechanism by which an initial nucleus is formed and allows the protein to form a specific amyloid conformation has been unclear. Here we show that, before fiber formation, the prion domain (Sup35NM, consisting of residues 1-254) of yeast prion Sup35, the [PSI(+)] protein determinant, forms oligomers in a temperature-dependent, reversible manner. Mutational and biophysical analyses revealed that 'non-native' aromatic interactions outside the amyloid core drive oligomer formation by bringing together different Sup35NM monomers, which specifically leads to the formation of highly infectious strain conformations with more limited amyloid cores. Thus, transient non-native interactions in the initial nucleus are pivotal in determining the diversity of amyloid conformations and resulting prion strain phenotypes."
https://openalex.org/W2134421268,"Allosteric modulators have been identified for several G protein-coupled receptors, most notably muscarinic receptors. To study their mechanism of action, we made use of a recently developed technique to generate fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET)-based sensors to monitor G protein-coupled receptor activation. Cyan fluorescent protein was fused to the C terminus of the M2 muscarinic receptor, and a specific binding sequence for the small fluorescent compound fluorescein arsenical hairpin binder, FlAsH, was inserted into the third intracellular loop; the latter site was labeled in intact cells by incubation with FlAsH. We then measured FRET between the donor cyan fluorescent protein and the acceptor FlAsH in intact cells and monitored its changes in real time. Agonists such as acetylcholine and carbachol induced rapid changes in FRET, indicative of agonist-induced conformational changes. Removal of the agonists or addition of an antagonist caused a reversal of this signal with rate constants between 400 and 1100 ms. The allosteric ligands gallamine and dimethyl-W84 caused no changes in FRET when given alone, but increased FRET when given in the presence of an agonist, compatible with an inactivation of the receptors. The kinetics of these effects were very rapid, with rate constants of 80–100 ms and ≈200 ms for saturating concentrations of gallamine and dimethyl-W84, respectively. Because these speeds are significantly faster than the responses to antagonists, these data indicate that gallamine and dimethyl-W84 are allosteric ligands and actively induce a conformation of the M2 receptor with a reduced affinity for its agonists.

All five subtypes of this receptor type (M1–M5) are activated by the endogenous ligand acetylcholine and have been reported to be susceptible to allosteric receptor modulation by various ligands (1.May L.T.

In particular, the M2 receptor subtype has been studied intensely during the last years with regard to its allosteric modulation (1.May L.T. Avlani V.A. Langmead C.J. Herdon H.J.

Several different allosteric ligands for muscarinic receptors have been identified, some of which, such as gallamine and W84 (hexamethylene-1,6-bis-[dimethyl-(3-phthalimidopropyl)-ammonium dibromide]), show some subtype selectivity for the M2 receptor (3.Huang X.P.

Allosteric ligands are defined by the fact that in the absence of an orthosteric ligand, they do not affect the activity of a receptor (7.Christopoulos A. May L.T. Avlani V.A. Sexton P.M. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2004; 32: 873-877Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) but that they alter the affinities of orthosteric ligands, presumably because of conformational changes in the receptor (8.May L.T.

Recent experimental evidence supports the hypothesis that allosteric ligands can induce specific receptor conformations by direct binding to an allosteric ligand site and that this may result in changes of the agonist-induced activity of the receptor (11.Li J.H.

These studies have shown alterations of antagonist [3H]N-methylscopolamine ([3H]NMS) radioligand binding, characterized by incomplete inhibition and a decreased speed of dissociation induced by allosteric ligands (15.Tränkle C. Weyand O. Voigtländer U. Mynett A. Lazareno S. Birdsall N.J. Mohr K. Mol. Pharmacol. 2003; 64: 180-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). At the same time, these compounds impaired agonist-induced receptor signals (13.Jäger D. Schmalenbach C. Prilla S. Schrobang J. Kebig A. Sennwitz M. Heller E. Tränkle C. Holzgrabe U. Höltje H.D.

However, these effects appear to depend on the system and ligand studied and may reveal positive or negative effects on agonist or antagonist binding (15.Tränkle C. Weyand O. Voigtländer U. Mynett A. Lazareno S. Birdsall N.J. Mohr K. Mol. Pharmacol. 2003; 64: 180-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), leaving the exact mechanism of action of these compounds open. Previous kinetic studies using radioligand binding suggest that the effects of some allosteric ligands might be quite rapid (5.Tränkle C. Dittmann A. Schulz U. Weyand O. Buller S. Jöhren K. Heller E.

However, the precise analysis of such effects requires methods that can record effects on receptors in the subsecond time range. Recently, we have developed an approach that allows monitoring of conformational changes in GPCRs in living cells based on fluorescence (or Foerster) resonance energy transfer (FRET) (16.Vilardaga J.P. Bünemann M. Krasel C. Castro M. Lohse M.J. Nat. Biotechnol. 2003; 21: 807-812Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar, 17.Vilardaga J.P. Nikolaev V.O. Lorenz K. Ferrandon S. Zhuang Z. Lohse M.J.

Sci. 2008; 29: 159-165Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). FRET is the transfer of energy from an excited donor to an acceptor molecule via long range dipole-dipole coupling mechanisms. To monitor conformational changes in the receptor, we initially developed fusions of GPCRs with cyan fluorescent protein (CFP) as the donor and yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) as the acceptor fluorophore (16.Vilardaga J.P. Bünemann M. Krasel C. Castro M. Lohse M.J. Nat. Biotechnol. 2003; 21: 807-812Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar, 17.Vilardaga J.P. Nikolaev V.O. Lorenz K. Ferrandon S. Zhuang Z. Lohse M.J. Nat. Chem. Biol. 2008; 4: 126-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). However, the insertion of the relatively large fluorescent proteins into an intracellular receptor loop may reduce their ability to couple to G proteins. Therefore, we have more recently adopted an approach replacing YFP by the small fluorescein arsenical hairpin binder (FlAsH) as the acceptor fluorophore; FlAsH can be used to covalently label a specific motif (CCPGCC) inserted into the 3rd intracellular loop (ICL) of receptors. Compared with the CFP/YFP approach, CFP/FlAsH constructs revealed larger agonist induced FRET changes and unaltered signaling properties of the receptors (20.Hoffmann C. Gaietta G. Bünemann M. Adams S.R. Oberdorff-Maass S. Behr B. Vilardaga J.P. Tsien R.Y. Ellisman M.H. Lohse M.J. Nat. Methods. 2005; 2: 171-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar, 21.Nikolaev V.O. Hoffmann C. Bünemann M. Lohse M.J. Vilardaga J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 24506-24511Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Here, we developed an M2 muscarinic receptor sensor and used it for the FRET-based real-time monitoring of receptor modulation by orthosteric and allosteric ligands. Analysis of receptor kinetics induced by allosteric ligands in living cells supports the view that allosteric modulation results in very rapid, actively induced conformational changes in the receptor. The ligands acetylcholine, atropine, gallamine, and methoctramine were all obtained from Sigma-Aldrich. Carbachol was purchased from Alfa Aesar (Karlsruhe, Germany), and dimethyl-W84 was purchased from Alexis Biochemicals/Enzo (Lörrach, Germany). FlAsH is commercially available from Invitrogen as TC-FlAsH. All other chemicals were from standard sources and of the highest purity available. To create a FRET-based sensor for the human muscarinic M2 receptor (GenBankTM accession number AF498916), the sequence of the enhanced CFP was fused to the C terminus of the receptor by replacing the stop codon with a linker amino acid sequence GSGEG. A FLAG tag (DYKDDDDK) with and without an additional hemagglutinin signaling sequence KTIIALSYIFCLVFA was fused to the N terminus of the receptor instead of the start codon to improve cell surface expression and to allow detection with antibodies. Finally, the FlAsH binding motif CCPGCC was inserted into the 3rd ICL (ICL3) of the receptor between the amino acid residues Asp229 and Lys370. The resultant construct is depicted in Fig. 1A. Cloning was performed by standard PCR-based techniques, and the final construct was verified by sequencing. HEK-TsA201 cells were maintained at 37 °C, 7% CO2 in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. All tissue culture media were supplemented with 100 units/ml penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Cells were transfected using the Effectene reagent (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). For fluorescence measurements, cells were seeded on poly-d-lysine-coated round glass coverslips, and the microscopy experiments were performed 48 h after transfection. CHO cells were maintained at 37 °C, 5% CO2 in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F12 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. Transfections were performed using the Lipofectamine 2000 reagent (Invitrogen). The binding of [3H]NMS (Amersham Biosciences) to the wild-type M2 receptor and the M2 receptor sensor was analyzed in membranes prepared from CHO cell lines expressing these receptors. Membranes (containing 10 μg of membrane protein) were incubated for 2 h at room temperature in the assay buffer (25 mm phosphate-buffered saline, 5 mm MgCl2, pH 7.4) with 1–10 nm [3H]NMS. Nonspecific binding was determined in the presence of 10 μm atropine. The reactions were terminated by vacuum filtration through GF/B glass fiber filters (Millipore). The labeling was done as described (20.Hoffmann C. Gaietta G. Bünemann M. Adams S.R. Oberdorff-Maass S. Behr B. Vilardaga J.P. Tsien R.Y. Ellisman M.H. Lohse M.J. Nat.

Pharmacol. 2009; 75: 534-541Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). In brief, transfected cells were washed twice on the coverslips with phenol red-free Hanks' balanced salt solution containing 1 g/liter glucose (HBSS; Invitrogen) and then incubated at 37 °C for 1 h with HBSS with 500 nm FlAsH and 12.5 μm 1,2-ethanedithiol. Subsequently, to reduce nonspecific labeling, the cells were washed twice with HBSS, incubated for 10 min with HBSS/250 μm 1,2-ethanedithiol, and again washed twice with HBSS before being used for fluorescence measurements. Confocal microscopy was performed using a Leica TCS SP2 system. FlAsH and CFP were excited with the 514 nm line of an argon ion laser or a 430-nm frequency-doubled diode laser, respectively. FRET microscopy was performed essentially as described (20.Hoffmann C. Gaietta G. Bünemann M. Adams S.R. Oberdorff-Maass S. Behr B. Vilardaga J.P. Tsien R.Y. Ellisman M.H. Lohse M.J. Nat.

Chem. 2006; 281: 24506-24511Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Live cells were maintained in FRET buffer: 144 mm NaCl, 5.4 mm KCl, 2 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.3. Measurements were performed at room temperature using a Zeiss Axiovert 200 inverted microscope equipped with an oil immersion ×100 objective, a dual emission photometric system and a Polychrome IV light source (Till Photonics, Gräfelfing, Germany). Excitation was done at 436 ± 10 nm (beam splitter DCLP 460 nm), applied with a frequency between 10 and 50 Hz depending on the nature of experiment. Fluorescence was recorded from entire single cells in FlAsH and CFP emission channels using 535 ± 15 nm and 480 ± 20 nm emission filters and a DCLP 505-nm beam splitter. FRET was monitored as the emission ratio FlAsH/CFP, which was corrected offline for the spillover of CFP into the FlAsH channel, direct FlAsH excitation, and photobleaching. To study ligand-induced changes in FRET, cells were continuously superfused with FRET buffer supplemented with various ligands as indicated, applied with the help of a computer-assisted solenoid valve-controlled rapid superfusion device ALA-VM8 (solution exchange in 5–10 ms; ALA Scientific Instruments). To measure M2 receptor-induced inhibition of cAMP signaling, CHO cells expressing the wild-type receptor or the M2 receptor sensor were transfected with the FRET-based cAMP sensor Epac1-camps, and the cAMP levels were measured by FRET imaging as described previously (23.Nikolaev V.O. Bünemann M. Hein L. Hannawacker A. Lohse M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 37215-37218Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (575) Google Scholar). After stimulation of cAMP production by 2 μm forskolin, increasing concentrations of carbachol were added to the cells in presence or absence of 100 μm gallamine. For the measurement of potassium currents, an extracellular solution of the following composition was used: 120 mm NaCl, 20 mm KCl, 2 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 10 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.3. The internal (pipette) solution contained 100 mm potassium aspartate, 40 mm KCl, 5 mm MgATP, 10 mm HEPES-KOH, 5 mm NaCl, 2 mm EGTA, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.01 mm GTP, pH 7.3. Membrane currents were recorded under voltage-clamp conditions, using a conventional whole cell patch-clamp technique (24.Hommers L.G. Lohse M.J. Bünemann M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 1037-1043Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Patch-pipettes were fabricated from borosilicate glass capillaries (GF-150–10, Warner Instrument Corp.) using a horizontal puller (P-95, Fleming & Poulsen), with a DC resistance of 3–6 MΩ. Membrane currents were recorded using either a patch-clamp amplifier (Axopatch 200; Axon Instruments) or an EPC 9 (HEKA Instruments) as described previously (24.Hommers L.G. Lohse M.J. Bünemann M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 1037-1043Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Signals were analog-filtered using a low pass Bessel filter (1–3-kHz corner frequency). IKACh was measured as an inward current using a holding potential of −90 mV as described (24.Hommers L.G. Lohse M.J. Bünemann M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 1037-1043Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Voltage ramps (from −120 mV to +60 mV in 500 ms, every 10 s) were used to determine current-voltage (I-V) relationships. Fluorescence intensities were acquired using Clampex (Axon Instruments). Values are given as mean ± S.E. of n independent experiments. Statistical analyses and curve fitting were performed using Prism 4.0 (GraphPad), Origin (OriginLab), or Clampfit (Axon Instruments). First, we created constructs in which the whole M2 receptor sequence was directly fused to the N terminus of CFP. Because such receptor constructs showed low expression in cells and poor membrane localization (data not shown), we inserted the 5-amino acid linker GSGEG between the receptor C terminus and CFP (Arg465) and introduced a FLAG tag on the N terminus (position 2) of the receptor, which resulted in significantly improved receptor expression and membrane localization (Fig. 1, A and B). The human M2 muscarinic receptor has a long ICL3. To improve the FRET efficiency between the fluorophores, we deleted a part of ICL3 (Pro230 to Thr369) that is not involved in G protein coupling (25.Kostenis E. Conklin B.R. Wess J. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 1487-1495Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Similar to the previously described α2A-adrenergic receptor sensor (17.Vilardaga J.P. Nikolaev V.O. Lorenz K.

Pharmacol. 2009; 75: 534-541Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), we inserted the CCPGCC FlAsH binding motif into the shortened loop. We chose FlAsH as the acceptor fluorophore because earlier studies have shown that FlAsH, compared with YFP, provided higher signal amplitudes and preserved the receptor functionality in terms of activation of downstream signaling (20.Hoffmann C. Gaietta G. Bünemann M. Adams S.R. Oberdorff-Maass S. Behr B. Vilardaga J.P. Tsien R.Y. Ellisman M.H. Lohse M.J. Nat.

Using radioligand binding assays, we confirmed that the M2 receptor sensor and the wild-type M2 receptor have similar affinities for carbachol and a negative allosteric ligand gallamine, as shown by the competitive displacement of [3H]NMS (Fig. 1C). To confirm that the resultant M2 receptor sensor can effectively couple to G proteins and induce downstream signaling, we first measured the Gi protein-mediated activation of GIRK channels and observed a concentration-dependent activation of the GIRK current (Fig. 1D). Next, we compared the ability of the wild-type M2 receptor and of the M2 receptor sensor to inhibit forskolin-stimulated cAMP production in CHO cells. Both receptors showed similar efficacies and potencies of cAMP inhibition by carbachol in the absence and presence of the negative allosteric ligand gallamine (Fig. 1E), suggesting that the receptor sensor maintained the full functionality of the native M2 receptor. For FRET experiments, we used single HEK-TsA201 cells, which showed clear membrane localization of the receptor sensor (Fig. 1B). Stimulation of fluorescent cells with the full receptor agonist acetylcholine resulted in a fast, reversible decrease in FlAsH and a concomitant increase in CFP fluorescence, indicative of a decrease in FRET (Fig. 2A). The changes in CFP and FlAsH fluorescence were clearly agonist-dependent and had maximal amplitudes of ∼5–6%, which can be easily measured without visible desensitization of the FRET signals after multiple stimulations (supplemental Fig. 1). Next, we used various concentrations of two M2 receptor agonists, acetylcholine and carbachol, to establish concentration-response curves with EC50 values of 1.5 or 5.1 μm, respectively (Fig. 2B). These values are high compared with potencies determined in other types of experiments, but it must be kept in mind that in the FRET experiments there is no receptor reserve, and they are measured under nonequilibrium conditions. We then investigated whether the M2 receptor sensor also reports effects of receptor antagonists. Atropine given alone did not cause any change in FRET (data not shown). However, when we applied atropine to cells that had been first stimulated with the agonists acetylcholine (Fig. 3A) or carbachol (Fig. 3B), this led to a rapid and complete reversal of the agonist-induced signals. The reversal of the FRET signals induced by atropine at saturating concentrations occurred faster than that induced by mere washout of the agonists (Fig. 3, bottom panels). This may indicate that in the latter case rebinding of agonists occurred and that the rates measured in the presence of atropine reflected the true dissociation rates of acetylcholine (τ ≈ 0.8 s) and carbachol (τ ≈ 0.5 s). Next, we investigated whether the M2 receptor sensor can be utilized to observe effects of allosteric receptor modulators. In this study, we used gallamine and dimethyl-W84, which have been characterized as negative allosteric modulators of muscarinic receptors; both dimethyl-W84 and gallamine have been described as relatively selective for the M2 receptor (26.Mohr K.

We initially used a 10 μm concentration of each ligand to determine whether the allosteric ligands produce a receptor signal in the absence of an orthosteric ligand (FIGURE 4, FIGURE 5). Cells were first stimulated with 100 μm acetylcholine or carbachol to show that the receptor was functional. After washout of the agonists, cells were superfused with an allosteric ligand. Gallamine (Fig. 4A) did not change the FRET signal when given alone; W84 (Fig. 5A) induced only a very small change in the F535/F480 ratio, caused by an isolated increase in F535 presumably due to its intrinsic fluorescent properties. These data indicate that the allosteric ligands alone do not affect the FRET signal of the M2 receptor sensor.FIGURE 4Effects of gallamine on the FRET signals of the M2 receptor sensor. A–C, F535/F480 traces (normalized to the starting values) as in Fig. 2, representative for 10–15 independent experiments. A, gallamine (10 μm) caused no changes in FRET when superfused alone. Gallamine 10 μm reverted the signal induced by 100 μm acetylcholine (B, left) or 100 μm carbachol (C, left).

(error bars), n = 6–8).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) In contrast, when given in the presence of an orthosteric agonist, both allosteric ligands partially reverted the FRET signals induced by acetylcholine (Figs. 4B and 5B) and carbachol (Figs. 4C and 5C). The extent of this reversal varied as a function of the nature and concentration of the allosteric ligand. At high concentrations, both allosteric ligands were able to reverse the agonist-induced FRET signals fully (Figs. 4, B and C, and 5, B and C, right panels). Dimethyl-W84 was more than 1 order of magnitude more potent than gallamine, with half-maximal reversal at less than 10 μm (Fig. 5, B and C). Interestingly, following W84 application and washout, neither acetylcholine nor carbachol evoked full FRET responses (Fig. 5, B and C), suggesting a high affinity of dimethyl-W84 for the M2 receptor or incomplete washout. Because our FRET-based approach represents a unique tool to monitor changes in receptor conformation in real time, we analyzed the kinetics of the different orthosteric and allosteric ligands used in this study. As in the preceding experiments, single cells were first superfused with an orthosteric ligand, acetylcholine or carbachol (both at a saturating concentration of 100 μm), and then the allosteric ligands were added at saturating concentrations (1 mm) on top of either acetylcholine (Fig. 6A) or carbachol (Fig. 6B) to determine the maximal speeds of the receptor conformational change induced by allosteric ligands. The reversal of FRET signals induced by saturating concentrations of the orthosteric antagonists atropine and methoctramine served as controls; the resultant off-rates were τACh,Atr = 677 ms ± 68 ms and τACh,Metho = 609 ms ± 87 ms for acetylcholine compared with τCarb,Atr = 494 ms ± 20 ms and τCarb,Metho = 432 ms ± 66 ms for carbachol. As shown above (Fig. 3), these rates are faster than those obtained by simple washout of the agonists, which were ≈1.1 s (acetylcholine) and ≈0.9 s (methoctramine), respectively. In contrast, gallamine and dimethyl-W84 reverted the agonist-induced FRET signals considerably faster. We were able to estimate the kinetic values accurately by measuring at 50 Hz (i.e. 20 data points/s) and fitting the FRET traces with the monoexponetial function as shown in Fig. 6, C–E. The values obtained for gallamine were τACh,Gall = 87.2 ms ± 6.6 ms and τCarb,Gall = 105 ms ± 17 ms; the values for W84 were τACh,W84 = 212ms ± 46 ms and τCarb,W84 = 175 ms ± 30 ms. A direct overlay of the traces caused by saturating concentrations of atropine and gallamine is shown in Fig. 6F and illustrates the much higher speed of the effect of the allosteric ligand. Because some allosteric ligands such as dimethyl-W84 may be hydrolyzed by cellular esterases, we tested whether the kinetics of dimethyl-W84 responses are affected by these enzymes. Inhibition of esterases with physostigmine did not result in any change of kinetic constants (supplemental Fig. 1B), suggesting that in our measuring system the esterases do not show any significant ef"

Disruption of this complex results in the inhibition of cardiomyocyte hypertrophy and heart failure in vivo. By tandem affinity purification and mass spectrometric analyses, we identified cyclin-dependent kinase-9 (Cdk9) as a novel GATA4-binding partner. Cdk9 also formed a complex with p300 as well as GATA4 and cyclin T1. We showed that p300 was required for the interaction of GATA4 with Cdk9 and for the kinase activity of Cdk9. Conversely, Cdk9 kinase activity was required for the p300-induced transcriptional activities, DNA binding, and acetylation of GATA4. Furthermore, the kinase activity of Cdk9 was required for the phosphorylation of p300 as well as for cardiomyocyte hypertrophy. These findings demonstrate that Cdk9 forms a functional complex with the p300/GATA4 and is required for p300/GATA4- transcriptional pathway during cardiomyocyte hypertrophy.

Heart failure results from a variety of cardiovascular disorders including myocardial infarction and hypertension, and is a principal cause of death and disability in humans (1.Dominguez L.J. Parrinello G. Amato P. Licata G. Cardiologia. 1999; 44: 801-808PubMed Google Scholar). A major morphogenic change in failing hearts is hypertrophy of each cardiomyocyte, an increase in its cell volume (2.Verdecchia P. Carini G. Circo A. Dovellini E. Giovannini E. Lombardo M. Solinas P.

Hence, intense investigation has focused on elucidating the mechanisms of cardiomyocyte hypertrophy that eventually leads to the development of heart failure. At the transcriptional level, cardiomyocyte hypertrophy is characterized by changes in specific gene expressions controlled by a subset of hypertrophy-responsive transcription factors including MEF2, SRF, and a zinc finger protein, GATA4 (3.Akazawa H.

Whereas these interactions regulate the transcriptional potential of GATA4 downstream of hypertrophy signaling pathways, disruption of this complex results in the inhibition of hypertrophic responses. Therefore, identifying novel GATA4 binding partners is critical to elucidate the precise mechanisms that mediate hypertrophic responses in cardiac myocytes. A transcriptional co-activator, p300, also directly interacts with GATA4 to synergistically activate the atrial natriuretic factor (ANF) 2The abbreviations used are: ANFatrial natriuretic factorHAhemagglutininChIPchromatin immunoprecipitationGFPgreen fluorescent proteinPEphenylephrineHAThistone acetyltransferaseCDKcyclin-dependent kinaseDRB5,6-dichloro-1-h-ribofuranosyl-benzimidazole. and β-myosin heavy chain (β-MHC) promoters during myocardial cell hypertrophy (10.Kakita T.

Through its histone acetyltransferase (HAT) activity, p300 acetylates not only histone to promote an active chromatin configuration, but also GATA4 to increase its DNA binding and transcriptional activities (12.Yanazume T.

HAT activity of p300 is required for myocardial hypertrophy in vitro and for the promotion of left ventricular remodeling in vivo (13.Miyamoto S. Kawamura T. Morimoto T. Ono K. Kawase Y. Kita T. Hasegawa K. Circulation. 2006; 113: 679-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Recently, we and others have reported that a natural p300-specific HAT inhibitor, curcumin, prevents the development of cardiomyocyte hypertrophy and heart failure in vivo, further emphasizing the importance of p300 in these processes (14.Morimoto T. Sunagawa Y. Kawamura T. Takaya T. Wada H. Nagasawa A. Komeda M. Fujita M. Shimatsu A. Kita T. Hasegawa K. J. Clin. Invest. 2008; 118: 868-878PubMed Google Scholar, 15.Li H.L. Liu C. de Couto G.

In addition, p300 acts as a scaffold protein in the assembly of multisubunit transcription factor complexes for specific cardiac promoters, thereby conferring further specificity. Interestingly, the characterized interaction of GATA4 with FOG-2 is mediated through p300 (16.Hirai M. Ono K. Morimoto T. Kawamura T. Wada H. Kita T. Hasegawa K. J. Biol.

A mechanism for hypertrophic growth must involve a global increase in the RNA content per cell. Among several regulatory factors that specifically target the transcriptional elongation, positive transcription elongation factor b (P-TEFb) induces hyperphosphorylation of the C-terminal domain in RNA pol II, a critical, essential step to produce messenger RNA (17.Shim E.Y. Walker A.K. Shi Y. Blackwell T.K. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 2135-2146Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). P-TEFb, a heterodimer composed of cyclin-dependent kinase 9 (Cdk9) and cyclin T1 (or the miner form T2 or K) (18.Price D.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 2629-2634Crossref PubMed Scopus (568) Google Scholar), not only plays an important role in most RNA pol II-dependent transcription (17.Shim E.Y. Walker A.K. Shi Y. Blackwell T.K.

However, the mechanisms regulating the recruitment of P-TEFb to cardiac hypertrophy-responsive promoters remain poorly understood. To identify novel binding partners of GATA4, we used a proteomics strategy to purify the GATA4 complex. Herein, we report that Cdk9 is a novel component of the p300/GATA4 complex and required for the p300-induced acetylation of GATA4. Moreover, Cdk9 contributed to hypertrophy responsive-transcription through its recruitment of the p300/GATA4 complex to the transcriptional machinery. The expression vectors pCMVβ-gal, pCMVwtp300, and pcDNAG4 were previously described (12.Yanazume T. Hasegawa K. Morimoto T. Kawamura T. Wada H. Matsumori A. Kawase Y. Hirai M. Kita T. Mol. Cell.

Mass spectrometry was performed by the Taplin Biological Mass Spectrometry Facility, Cell Biology, Harvard Medical School. Data analysis was performed with the ProFound software. GST fusion proteins were immobilized on glutathione-agarose beads (GE Healthcare) and used for in vitro protein interaction assays. Portions (10 μl) of glutathione-agarose beads bearing equal amounts of either GST or the fusion proteins (1 to 2 μg) were mixed with His6 fusion proteins (300 ng) in 200 μl of binding buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 0.1% Tween 20, 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, and 0.25 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). The binding reaction mixtures were gently rocked on a rotating wheel at room temperature for 1 h. The beads were then washed four times with 600 μl of the same buffer, resuspended in NuPAGE LDS sample buffer (Invitrogen), and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. GST-fused proteins were visualized by Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining. His6-tagged proteins were analyzed by blotting with individual antibodies, anti-GATA4 antibody, anti-Cdk9 antibody, and anti-HA antibody for the p300 fragment. Primary neonatal rat cardiac myocytes were prepared and co-transfected with the indicated amounts of DNA using Lipofectamine Plus (Invitrogen), as described previously (16.Hirai M. Ono K. Morimoto T.

For the analysis of the total amount of GATA4 after immunoprecipitation, the membrane was reprobed with goat polyclonal anti-GATA4 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). The levels of signals were estimated using photographs taken with LAS1000 plus (FUJIFILM) and by quantification with Multi Gauge V3.0 (FUJIFILM). Histones were isolated by acid extraction using a commercial kit (Upstate) according to the manufacturer's recommendations, as previously described (14.Morimoto T. Sunagawa Y. Kawamura T. Takaya T.

In brief, after fixation of the genomic DNA and nuclear proteins with formalin, extracts were sonicated, subsequently immunoprecipitated with goat polyclonal anti-GATA4 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), goat polyclonal anti-Cdk9 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), or control goat IgG, and immunocomplexes were captured by adding protein G beads. After the precipitates were washed four times in a low stringency buffer, DNA was purified by phenol-chloroform extraction, and precipitated with ethanol. To detect the ANF promoter containing a GATA site, collected DNA was subjected to PCR analysis using a thermal cycler with the specific primers for the ANF promoter. For quantitative real-time PCR, the reaction was performed with a SYBR® Green PCR master mix (Applied Biosystems), and the products were analyzed with a thermal cycler (ABI Prism® 7900HT sequence detection system). Levels of GAPDH transcript were used to normalize cDNA levels. Sequences of the primers were as follows: 5′- CTGAGGCGAGCGCCCAGGAAGATA-3′ (sense for the rat ANF promoter), 5′-AAGATGCCCTTTTAAAGTTATCAG- 3′ (antisense for the rat ANF promoter), 5′-GTCATTGAGAGCAATGCCAG-3′ (sense for the rat GAPDH promoter), and 5′-GTGTTC CTACCCCCAATGTG-3′ (antisense for the rat GAPDH promoter). Re-ChIP assays were performed as previously described (24.Wang J. Paradis P. Aries A. Komati H. Lefebvre C. Wang H. Nemer M. Mol. Cell.

In brief, the primary immunocomplexes obtained with rabbit polyclonal anti-p300 (a mixture of N-15 and C-20) or goat polyclonal anti-Cdk9 antibodies were eluted by 10 mm dithiothreitol with agitation at 37 °C for 30 min. The elute was diluted 20 times with re-ChIP buffer (0.01% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, 15 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9) and immunoprecipitated with rabbit polyclonal anti-GATA4 antibody. The cardiac myocytes were grown in flask-style chambers with glass slides (Nalgen Nunc) and stained with anti-β-MHC antibody that reacts with both α- and cardiac β-MHC using the indirect immunoperoxidase method, as previously described (12.Yanazume T.

Then, the surface area of these cells was measured semiautomatically with the aid of an image analyzer (Image Pro-Plus), as described previously (12.Yanazume T. Hasegawa K. Morimoto T. Kawamura T.

BLOCK-iT Lentiviral RNAi Pol II miR Expression System with GFP (Invitrogen) was used for the construction of the lentiviral expression construct according to the manufacturer's instructions. Short pairs of sense and antisense DNA oligo encoding a sense-loop-antisense sequence to rat Cdk9 gene was synthesized for the validated corresponding shRNA, and sequences are as follow : 5′- TGCTGAGTAGAGGCCATTCAGCAGCAGTTTTGGCCACTGACTGACTGCTGCTGTGGCCTCTACT-3′ (sense for the rat shRNA-Cdk9) and 5′-CCTGAGTAGAGGCCACAGCAGCAGTCAGTCAGTGGCCAAAACTGCTGCTGAATGGCCTCTACTC-3′ (antisense for the rat shRNA-Cdk9). The complementary DNA oligos were annealed and ligated to the entry vectors and subcloned into the pLenti6.3/V5-DEST vector (Invitrogen). All the cloned sequences were confirmed by DNA sequencing. The recombinant lentiviral vectors and pLenti6.3/V5-GW/EmGFP vector, as a control, were individually co-transfected with ViraPower packaging mix (Invitrogen) by using Lipofectamine 2000 and packaged into pseudotyped lentivirus by using 293FT cells. Viral supernatants were harvested 48 h after transfection and filtered through a 0.45-μm filter. Data are presented as the mean ± S.E. Statistical comparisons were performed with the use of unpaired 2-tailed Student t-tests or ANOVA with Scheffé's test when appropriate, with a probability value <0.05 taken to indicate significance. In this study, the tandem affinity purification method (22.Nakatani Y. Ogryzko V. Methods Enzymol. 2003; 370: 430-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar) (supplemental Fig. S1) was employed to identify proteins that are associated with GATA4. A murine GATA4 cDNA tagged with HA and FLAG at the N terminus (e-GATA4) was cloned into a retroviral expression vector. By transducing this vector into HeLaS3 cells, GATA4 was stably expressed in these cells. Nuclear extracts from these cells were subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-FLAG and anti-HA antibodies. Then, the immunopurified GATA4 complexes were separated on SDS gels (Fig. 1A). The identity of these bands was determined by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry. One of the proteins purified with e-GATA4 was Cdk9, a component of P-TEFb. GATA4 formed a functional complex with p300 during cardiomyocyte hypertrophy. Therefore, we examined the binding of p300/Cdk9 in addition to p300/GATA4 and GATA4/Cdk9 in HeLa cells expressing GATA4 with FLAG epitope peptides. Furthermore, we examined the binding of cyclin T1, another component of pTEF-b, with p300 and GATA4 as well as Cdk9. Nuclear extracts from HeLa cells were subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-FLAG, anti-Cdk9, or anti-p300 antibodies, followed by Western blotting with each of these antibodies and with anti-cyclin T1 antibody. As shown in Fig. 1B, we observed the interaction of p300/GATA4 (compare lanes 3 and 4 in the 4th panel of B) and GATA4/Cdk9 (compare lanes 3 and 4 in the 2nd panel of B), as expected. Cdk9 physically interacted with not only GATA4 but also p300 (lanes 9 and 10 in the 1st and 4th panels of B). Moreover, cyclin T1 formed a complex with p300 and GATA4 as well as Cdk9 (lanes 3–11 in the 3rd panel of B). By GST pull-down assay using His6-GATA4 and GST-Cdk9 (Fig. 1C) or His6-Cdk9 and GST-GATA4 (Fig. 1D), we confirmed that GATA4 and Cdk9 directly and physically interact each other. To determine the domain of each protein involved in the interaction between GATA4 and Cdk9, a series of GST pull-down assays was performed. We fused various N-, C-, or both N- and C-terminal deletion mutants with GST (Fig. 2, A and C). As shown in Fig. 2B, deletion of the N-terminal region of GATA4 up to residues 179 did not affect its ability to bind to Cdk9. However, the deletion of GATA4 residues 180–255 abrogated the interaction with Cdk9, whereas a small GATA4 fragment containing residues 180–255 was able to bind to Cdk9. These findings suggest that GATA4 amino acid sequences 180–255 containing the N-terminal zinc finger domain are crucial for its interaction with Cdk9, although the data do not exclude the possibility that GATA4-(N1–179) containing the transactivation domain has a binding site for Cdk9. Next, we performed opposite experiments to determine the GATA4-binding site within Cdk9. Deletion of the N-terminal region of Cdk9 up to residue 82 did not affect its ability to bind to GATA4. The deletion of Cdk9 residues 83 to 129 abrogated the interaction with GATA4 (Fig. 2D). This suggests that the fragment of 83–129 of Cdk9 includes sequences that bind to GATA4. Because the C/H-3 domain of p300 has many binding sites for sequence-specific transcription factors, we used a GST pull-down assay to examine the binding between Cdk9 and the p300 fragment (1514–1922) containing the C/H-3 domain (25.Yuan W. Condorelli G. Caruso M. Felsani A. Giordano A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9009-9013Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). This p300 fragment (1514–1922) inhibits the function of endogenous p300 as a dominant-negative mutant in many transcriptional pathways. In cardiomyocytes, this fragment suppresses hypertrophic responses as well as GATA4-dependent transcription (12.Yanazume T. Hasegawa K. Morimoto T. Kawamura T. Wada H. Matsumori A. Kawase Y. Hirai M. Kita T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 3593-3606Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1E, this p300 fragment tagged with GST was pulled down with Cdk9. On the other hand, as revealed in Fig. 1F, Cdk9 tagged with GST was pulled down with the p300 fragment tagged with the HA probe. To determine a Cdk9 domain that interacts with p300, we used a series of Cdk9 deletion mutants tagged with GST and the HA- tagged p300-(1514–1922) fragment (Fig. 2C). As shown in Fig. 2E, whereas the full length of Cdk9 and the N-terminal region of Cdk9 (residues 1–82) bound p300, deletion of the N-terminal Cdk9 region, residues 1–82, abrogated the interaction with p300. These observations suggest that fragment 1–82 of Cdk9 includes sequences that bind to p300. We investigated whether GATA6, another member of the GATA family, involved in hypertrophic responses in cardiomyocytes (26.Peterkin T. Gibson A. Loose M. Patient R. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 2005; 16: 83-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 27.Liang Q. De Windt L.J. Witt S.A. Kimball T.R. Markham B.M. Molkentin J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30245-30253Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar), can bind to Cdk9. COS7 cells were transfected with either GATA4 or GATA6 in addition to Cdk9. Nuclear extracts from these cells were subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-Cdk9, or IgG as a control, followed by Western blotting with anti-GATA4, anti-GATA6, or anti-Cdk9 antibody. The results clearly demonstrated that not only GATA4 but also GATA6 interacted with Cdk9 (supplemental Fig. S2D). A fragment of p300-(1514–1922) is able to interact with GATA4, but does not possess HAT activity. This fragment blocks the binding between p300 and GATA4, represses the p300-induced acetylation of GATA4, and reduces GATA4-dependent transcriptional activity, thus serving as a dominant-negative mutant. To determine whether p300-(1514–1922) will affect the ability of Cdk9 to interact with GATA4 and to phosphorylate RNA pol II, expression plasmids encoding FLAG-tagged GATA4, full-length p300, and HA-tagged p300-(1514–1922) were co-transfected into COS7 cells, as indicated in Fig. 3, A and B. To monitor RNA pol II phosphorylation, we performed Western blotting with antibody that recognizes hyperphosphorylated (IIo) and hypophosphorylated (IIa) RNA pol II. Nuclear extracts from these cells were subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-FLAG antibody. Western blotting of these precipitates demonstrated that the expression of p300-(1514–1922) completely inhibited p300-induced GATA4 acetylation, as expected (1st panel of Fig. 3B, compare 2nd and 3rd bars of Fig. 3D). The co-expression of p300 in addition to GATA4 and Cdk9 induced the phosphorylation of RNA pol II (5th and 6th panels of Fig. 3A, 1st and 2nd bars of Fig. 3C) and increased the interaction between GATA4 and Cdk9 (4th panel of Fig. 3B, 1st and 2nd bars of Fig. 3E). However, the expression of p300-(1514–1922) in addition to p300 inhibited p300-induced RNA pol II phosphorylation (5th and 6th panels of Fig. 3A, 2nd and 3rd bars of Fig. 3C) and disrupted the GATA4/Cdk9 interaction (4th panel of Fig. 3B, 2nd and 3rd bars of Fig. 3E). The expression of p300 and p300-(1514–1922) did not influence the amount of GATA4 (1st panel of Fig. 3A) or Cdk9 (3rd panel of Fig. 3A). These results suggest that p300 is involved in the phosphorylation of RNA pol II and in the ability of GATA4 to interact with Cdk9. To determine the role of Cdk9 kinase activity in the formation of the p300/GATA4 complex and p300-induced acetylation of GATA4, we utilized a dominant-negative form of Cdk9 (DN-Cdk9) lacking kinase activity due to a single amino acid substitution. Expression plasmids encoding FLAG-tagged GATA4, p300, and Cdk9 or DN-Cdk9 were transfected into COS7 cells. Nuclear extracts from these cells were subjected to Western blotting or immunoprecipitation with anti-FLAG antibody followed by Western blotting. In the presence of wild-type Cdk9, p300 induced the phosphorylation of RNA pol II (4th and 5th panels of Fig. 4A, 1st and 2nd bars of Fig. 4D), promoted the formation of the p300/GATA4/Cdk9 complex (3rd and 4th panels of Fig. 4B), and increased GATA4 acetylation (1st panel of Fig. 4B, 1st and 2nd bars of Fig. 4E). However, in the presence of DN-Cdk9 instead of wild-type Cdk9, p300 was unable to achieve these changes (4th and 5th panels of Fig. 4A, 2nd and 3rd bars of Fig. 4D, 1st, 3rd, and 4th panels of Fig. 4B, 2nd and 3rd bars of Fig. 4E). These observations demonstrate that Cdk9 kinase activity is required for the p300-induced acetylation of GATA4. Because Cdk9 binds to p300, we hypothesized that Cdk9, by its kinase activity, phosphorylates p300. To test this hypothesis, the same nuclear extracts used for Fig. 4, A and B were immunoprecipitated with anti-p300 antibody followed by Western blotting using anti- phospho-serine/threonine antibody. DN-Cdk9 reduced the phosphorylation of full length p300, indicating that Cdk9 kinase activity is required for the phosphorylation of p300 (1st panel of Fig. 4C). Next, to determine whether Cdk9 can phosphorylate the p300 domain that interacts with Cdk9, the FLAG-tagged expression plasmid encoding the p300-(1514–1922) fragment and the Cdk9 or DN-Cdk9 expression plasmid were co-transfected into COS7 cells, as indicated in Fig. 5, A and B. Nuclear extracts from these cells were subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-FLAG antibody,"

To facilitate bone resorption, osteoclasts generate an actin-rich sealing zone composed of densely packed podosome-like units. Patterning of both podosomes and sealing zones is dependent upon an intact microtubule system. A role for unconventional myosin X (Myo10), which can bind actin, microtubules, and integrins, was examined in osteoclasts.

Further, complexes containing both Myo10 and β-tubulin were readily precipitated from osteoclasts lysates. RNAi-mediated suppression of Myo10 led to decreased cell and sealing zone perimeter, along with decreased motility and resorptive capacity. Further, siRNA-treated cells could not properly position podosomes following microtubule disruption. Osteoclasts overexpressing dominant negative Myo10 microtubule binding domains (MyTH4) showed a similar phenotype.

These studies suggest that Myo10 plays a role in osteoclast attachment and podosome positioning by direct linkage of actin to the microtubule network. Osteoclastic bone resorption is dependent on tight attachment of the cell to the bone substrate. When on bone, osteoclasts form the sealing zone, a ring-shaped structure that surrounds the ruffled border, through which protons and proteases are secreted to effect resorption. Sealing zones are composed of structural units with certain similarities to podosomes that osteoclasts form on non-bone substrates (1.Luxenburg C. Geblinger D. Klein E. Anderson K. Hanein D. Geiger B. Addadi L. PLoS ONE. 2007; 2: e179Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). Podosomes, termed for their foot-like appearance, are typified by short F-actin bundles orientated perpendicular to the substrate (2.Marchisio P.C. Cirillo D. Naldini L. Primavera M.V. Teti A.

Podosomes form a cylindrical core of F-actin with a “cloud” of microfilaments radiating from the base of the core (1.Luxenburg C. Geblinger D. Klein E. Anderson K. Hanein D. Geiger B. Addadi L. PLoS ONE. 2007; 2: e179Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). Actin-binding proteins, integrins, and regulatory proteins such as kinases associate specifically with the actin core or the radiating cloud of F-actin that surrounds the podosomes and with specific regions of the sealing zone. Microtubules also are critical for the integrity of these actin-rich structures, as several groups have demonstrated that podosome and sealing zone formation and function in macrophages and osteoclasts are dependent on an intact microtubule system (4.Destaing O.

Myosins are actin-based molecular motors involved in many cellular processes including muscle contraction, cell migration, cell polarization, and mitosis. Myosins consist of a head domain that hydrolyzes ATP and binds F-actin, IQ domains that bind calmodulin or calmodulin-like proteins, and tail domains that allow the myosins to attach to cargo. Categorized by the motor head domain, myosins are currently grouped into over 20 classes (9.Odronitz F. Kollmar M. Genome Biol. 2007; 8: R196Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). We recently showed that regulated proteolysis of the “classical” myosin IIA isoform stimulates the onset of cell fusion during osteoclastogenesis (10.McMichael B.K. Wysolmerski R.B. Lee B.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 12266-12275Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Myosin X (Myo10), which is expressed in most vertebrate tissues at low levels, is the sole member of the class X myosins (11.Berg J.S. Derfler B.H. Pennisi C.M. Corey D.P. Cheney R.E. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 3439-3451Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Myo10 possesses a long tail that has been predicted to contain a coiled-coil domain adjacent to its IQ motifs, allowing dimerization as seen with classical myosins (11.Berg J.S. Derfler B.H. Pennisi C.M. Corey D.P. Cheney R.E. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 3439-3451Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); however, empirical studies suggest that this region may instead form a single α-helix that lengthens the head domain (12.Knight P.J.

Beyond this region, each Myo10 tail also possesses three pleckstrin homology domains (PH), one myosin tail homology 4 domain (MyTH4), 2The abbreviations used are: MyTH4myosin tail homology 4 domainGFPgreen fluorescent proteinsiRNAsmall-interfering RNA. and a FERM domain (11.Berg J.S. Derfler B.H. Pennisi C.M. Corey D.P. Cheney R.E. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 3439-3451Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). PH domains have been shown to be involved in protein-protein interactions along with mediating signaling transduction through binding of phosphoinositides (13.Lemmon M.A. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2004; 32: 707-711Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). FERM domains link cell membrane proteins to the cytoskeleton (14.Chishti A.H. Kim A.C. Marfatia S.M. Lutchman M. Hanspal M.

Reddy A.S. Plant Cell. 1998; 10: 957-965Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). These various tail domains allow Myo10 to bind and potentially transport multiple proteins. Myo10, through immunoprecipitation and hybrid assays, has been shown so far to bind actin, microtubules, VASP, products of PI3 kinase, and beta integrins (16.Cox D. Berg J.S. Cammer M.

In this study, we have examined the role of Myo10 in osteoclast podosome patterning and sealing zone formation. We hypothesize Myo10 is a potentially important contributor to osteoclast attachment, resorption, and migration due to its capacity to bind integrins and as an effector of PI3 kinase, a signaling molecule known to play a crucial role in osteoclast spreading and motility (22.Hruska K.A. Rolnick F. Huskey M. Alvarez U. Cheresh D. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 2984-2992Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 23.Lakkakorpi P.T. Wesolowski G. Zimolo Z. Rodan G.A. Rodan S.B. Exp.

Here we demonstrate that Myo10 plays a role in osteoclast attachment and subsequent cell spreading and migration by linking podosomes/sealing zones to the microtubule network. This work is the first to define a role for Myo10 in podosome-based adhesion, as well as demonstrating its role as a linker between the two cytoskeletal systems in osteoclasts. Affinity-purified chicken antibody against mouse Myo10 was previously described (26.Sousa A.D. Berg J.S. Robertson B.W. Meeker R.B. Cheney R.E. J. Cell Sci. 2006; 119: 184-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The specificity of this antibody in immunocytochemistry is demonstrated in supplemental Fig. S1, showing lack of reactivity by preimmune serum as well as loss of specific labeling in Myo10 siRNA-treated cells. In addition, supplemental Fig. S1 shows a Western blot of lysate from mature osteoclasts probed with the affinity-purified antibody. This Western demonstrates that murine osteoclasts express full-length Myo10 (at ∼250 kDa), consistent with results seen in macrophages (16.Cox D. Berg J.S. Cammer M. Chinegwundoh J.O. Dale B.M. Cheney R.E. Greenberg S. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 469-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Minor bands represent breakdown products that are routinely seen in lysates from osteoclasts, which are highly proteolytically active. A “motor-less” 165-kDa isoform of Myo10 found in brain (26.Sousa A.D. Berg J.S. Robertson B.W. Meeker R.B. Cheney R.E. J.

For visualization of microtubules, glutaraldehyde was added at a final concentration of 0.75% to each fixative solution. Primary antibodies were added in a standard PEG blocking buffer, and were detected using Alexa-labeled secondary antibodies (Invitrogen). F-actin was labeled using Alexa-coupled phalloidin, also from Invitrogen. Nuclei were labeled by incubation with bisbenzimide for 10 min following the secondary staining. Cells were visualized using either a Nikon Eclipse 80i epifluorescent microscope with SPOT software (Diagnostic Instruments, Sterling Heights, MI) or a Zeiss 510 META laser scanning confocal microscope at the Campus Microscopy and Imaging Facility, The Ohio State University. Cell perimeter was measured using SigmaScan Pro 5.0 software (SPSS Science, Chicago, IL). To determine Myo10 mRNA expression levels by competitive RT-PCR, primers were created that corresponded to murine sequences. The sense primer was of the sequence 5′-AACAATGGACAGCTTCTTTCCCG-3′, while the antisense primer was of the sequence 5′-GCGATAGCATTCGTTGGCAATGG-3′. For an internal standard, a cDNA was created that corresponded to the expected PCR product using the primers above, but contained an internal deletion of 21%, a T7 promoter element, and a tail of 15 adenosines, as previously described (28.McMichael B.K.

This product was transcribed in vitro using the MAXIscript system (Ambion, Austin, TX), and 1 pg of the resulting RNA (the internal standard) was added to 1 μg of osteoclast total cellular RNA prior to reverse transcription and PCR. These reactions were performed using the Superscript First-strand synthesis System and TaqDNA Polymerase, both from Invitrogen. The resulting RT-PCR products were run in a 2% agarose gel and stained with ethidium bromide to visualize the relative intensities of the bands, which were measured using Quantity One software (Bio-Rad). Immunoprecipitation was performed essentially as previously described (10.McMichael B.K. Wysolmerski R.B. Lee B.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 12266-12275Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 32.Lee B.S. Gluck S.L. Holliday L.S. J. Biol.

The cells were solubilized in M-PER supplemented with protease inhibitors, and the resulting lysates were centrifuged for 10 min at 20,000 × g to remove insoluble material. Precleared lysates were incubated with Myo10 or tubulin antibody for 12–16 h at 4 °C and then with anti-chicken IgY-agarose (Gallus Immunotech, Cary, NC) or protein A-Sepharose for 30 min at 4 °C. The complexes were washed with NET-GEL buffer (50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 5 mm sodium azide, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, and 0.25% gelatin), run in SDS-PAGE, transferred to Hybond membrane and probed by Western analysis. [35S]Methionine/cysteine pulse-labeling of cells for analysis of Myo10 stability was performed as previously described (10.McMichael B.K. Wysolmerski R.B. Lee B.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 12266-12275Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). For Western analysis of whole cell lysates, osteoclasts were harvested with M-PER reagent (Pierce Biotechnology), run in pre-cast PAGE 4–20% gradient gels (Bio-Rad) and transferred to Hybond membrane (GE HealthCare Biosciences, Piscataway, NJ). Primary antibodies were allowed to bind to the membranes using standard methodology, and were detected using horseradish peroxidase-labeled secondary antibodies coupled with SuperSignal West Pico Chemiluminescent reagents (Pierce Biotechnology). To suppress murine Myo10 expression, siRNAs were designed and synthesized by Ambion (Austin, TX). siRNA 73578, which was used for all relevant experiments, was found to have optimal activity at 75 nm, whereas siRNA 73762, which was used to confirm many of the results, was optimally active at 50 nm. For all experiments, a non-targeting dsRNA from Ambion (Austin, TX) was used as a negative control, and siRNAs homologous to siRNAs 73578 and 73762 but containing three point mutations in the middle of the sequence also were used as negative controls (co73578, co73762). RAW264.7 cells were plated and stimulated with GST-RANKL to form osteoclasts. On day 4 of differentiation, targeting siRNAs or an equivalent concentration of a negative control siRNA was added to Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) in plain Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and added to the cells. After 3 h, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 20% fetal bovine serum, l-glutamine, and 100 ng/ml RANKL were added, and the Lipofectamine complex was allowed to remain on the cells for 16 additional hours. Using this method, transfection efficiencies of >95% were achieved, as previously reported (28.McMichael B.K. Lee B.S. Exp. Cell Res. 2008; 314: 564-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). For immunocytochemical analysis, the cells were scraped and replated on ivory slices or glass coverslips immediately following the transfection. For RNA analysis, total cellular RNA was harvested 2 days post-transfection with RNA-Bee (Tel-test, Inc., Friendswood, TX). For protein analysis, whole cell lysates were harvested 1–4 days post transfection with M-PER. Bone marrow-derived osteoclasts were transfected via electroporation as previously described (10.McMichael B.K. Wysolmerski R.B. Lee B.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 12266-12275Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 28.McMichael B.K. Lee B.S. Exp.

On day 4 of differentiation in culture, after osteoclasts had formed, cells were scraped, pelleted, and resuspended in siPORT buffer (Ambion, Austin, TX). The cells were electroporated at 250 V/50 μF with the siRNA solution (75 nm for siRNA 73578, 50 nm for siRNA 73762) or an equal concentration of negative control siRNA, then plated in standard differentiation medium on glass or ivory for immunocytochemistry, or plastic for RNA and protein analysis. As for RAW264.7-derived osteoclasts, transfection efficiencies were >95%. For measurements of bone resorptive capacity, 3 days post-transfection, osteoclasts were plated on BD BioCoat Osteologic Discs (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA). These discs are composed of calcium phosphate mineral, which is capable of stimulating sealing zone formation in the absence of protein matrix (33.Saltel F. Destaing O. Bard F. Eichert D. Jurdic P. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 5231-5241Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). Control and siRNA-treated cells were kept on the discs for 3 days. The cells were removed by the addition of bleach for 5 min and several washes with water. Resorbed areas (clearings) were assayed by photographing the resulting discs under low magnification, and quantifying these areas with SigmaScan Pro 5.0 software (SPSS Science, Chicago, IL) as previously described (10.McMichael B.K. Wysolmerski R.B. Lee B.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 12266-12275Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 28.McMichael B.K. Lee B.S. Exp.

Equal numbers of images were compared among test groups. Groups were assayed for number of clearings, area per clearing, and total resorption. Motility was measured by the use of 8.0-μm pore Transwell migration chambers (Corning Life Sciences, Acton, MA). The bottom side of the membrane was coated with collagen (3 mg/ml diluted 1:2 with 100% ethanol) and dried overnight. Immediately following the transfection, the cells were scraped and replated at a low density on the upper side of the chamber. After 4 days (when RNAi treatment caused Myo10 suppression), the cells were stimulated to migrate overnight by the addition of 40 μg/ml osteopontin peptide to the bottom of the well. Cells on the upper side of the membrane were removed with a cotton swab, and the remaining cells were fixed and stained for tartrate resistant acid phosphatase using a Leukocyte Acid Phosphatase kit (Sigma). Osteoclasts 4 days post-transfection were placed at 4 °C for 3 h. Subsequently, the chilled medium was replaced with prewarmed (37 °C) medium for times indicated. Actin podosome belts (defined as a row of podosomes at the cell periphery) versus podosome clusters and podosome rings were counted in equal number of frames from three separate experiments. Full-length bovine Myo10 (amino acid residues 1–2052) or various tail fragments were PCR-amplified from the plasmid GFP-M10 (34.Berg J.S. Cheney R.E. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 246-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar) and subcloned into the pEF6/V5-His expression vector (Invitrogen). The MyTH4 domain fragment consisted of amino acid residues 1541–1712, while the MyTH4-FERM domain fragment consisted of residues 1541–2052. Each were overexpressed in RAW264.7 cells and selected by 3 μg/ml of blasticidin. For each construct at least four individual clones were assessed and found to produce similar results. Myo10 distribution was visualized by immunocytochemistry in RAW264.7- and mouse bone marrow-derived osteoclasts plated on glass coverslips or thinly cut ivory. Initially, we observed Myo10 distribution in osteoclasts that possessed mature adhesion structures. On glass, these are defined as peripheral belts of podosomes, a hallmark of fully mature osteoclasts (4.Destaing O. Saltel F. Géminard J.C. Jurdic P. Bard F. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 407-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar). Myo10 demonstrated a generally diffuse distribution throughout the cytoplasm without specifically overlapping podosomes, but was somewhat enriched immediately adjacent to peripheral podosome belts, although this enrichment was not present in all cells. Fig. 1A illustrates this distribution in marrow-derived osteoclasts, while Fig. 1B shows a similar result in RAW264.7-derived cells. Arrows indicate the enrichment of Myo10 adjacent to podosome belts. In resorbing osteoclasts on ivory, Myo10 was present throughout the cell yet was absent from the mature sealing zone (Fig. 1C, single sections and z-stacks). The general exclusion of Myo10 from peripheral podosome belts and sealing zones suggest that it is not a direct component of mature osteoclast adhesion structures. However, given Myo10 ability to bind integrins as well as to mediate effects of PI3 kinase (a signaling molecule with known effects on osteoclast spreading and migration), we hypothesized that it might play a role in formation or positioning of immature podosome structures and sealing zones. Thus, its role in osteoclasts was explored further. Peripheral belts of podosomes and circular sealing zones are not generated de novo; their formation occurs through ongoing processes of podosome or sealing zone patterning (4.Destaing O. Saltel F. Géminard J.C. Jurdic P. Bard F. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 407-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar, 33.Saltel F. Destaing O. Bard F. Eichert D. Jurdic P. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 5231-5241Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). Fig. 2A illustrates schematically how podosome belts and sealing zones are formed from distinct precursor structures. Maturing osteoclasts, when cultured on a non-bone substrate such as glass, initially form clusters of podosomes that are dispersed through the cell interior. As the cells mature, these clusters become rings that are internal to the cell periphery, until finally the cell forms a peripheral podosome belt (4.Destaing O. Saltel F. Géminard J.C. Jurdic P. Bard F. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 407-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar). The latter step from ring to belt is microtubule-dependent, because disruption of microtubules at this phase inhibits its progression. The formation of sealing zones in bone-attached cells is less well-defined; however, the nascent sealing zone appears to begin as an actin-rich patch, which then expands into a ring-like structure (33.Saltel F. Destaing O. Bard F. Eichert D. Jurdic P. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 5231-5241Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). However, sealing zone integrity also is dependent on microtubules, because their disruption causes sealing zone collapse (7.Jurdic P. Saltel F. Chabadel A. Destaing O. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 2006; 85: 195-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar, 8.Okumura S. Mizoguchi T. Sato N. Yamaki M. Kobayashi Y. Yamauchi H. Ozawa H. Udagawa N. Takahashi N. Bone. 2006; 39: 684-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). We examined the distribution of endogenous Myo10 in relationship to microtubules and/or F-actin in cells that had yet to form mature podosome belts or sealing zones. Fig. 2B illustrates a cell cultured on glass, in the transition stage between a podosome ring and the mature belt. The individual and merged images demonstrate a band of Myo10 overlapping the outer edges of the podosome ring, with microtubules positioned outside but terminating near the Myo10 (arrows). This arrangement, in which Myo10 is sandwiched between podosomes and microtubules, was noted in all podosome rings in the process of transitioning to the belt phase. However, this arrangement of Myo10 as an intermediary between microfilaments and microtubules was not seen in mature osteoclasts containing podosome belts, suggesting that the positioning of Myo10 between podosomes and microtubules may be a transient event that occurs during podosome patterning and is no longer needed once stable podosome belts are formed. Additionally, we searched osteoclasts cultured on ivory to find nascent sealing zones in the actin patch stage. When cells were labeled for Myo10 and F-actin, we found that Myo10 surrounds the actin patch in a ringed distribution (Fig. 2C). Given Myo10 distribution in encircling podosome rings and nascent sealing zones, we hypothesize that this myosin may play a role in patterning of osteoclast adhesion structures. Myo10 contains a MyTH4 domain and this domain has been shown to bind to microtubules (18.Weber K.L. Sokac A.M. Berg J.S. Cheney R.E. Bement W.M. Nature. 2004; 431: 325-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Our immunocytochemistry suggests that Myo10 may interact with microtubules in maturing osteoclasts. To examine this by biochemical means, we immunoprecipitated either Myo10 or β-tubulin and Western blotted these precipitates for their potential binding partner. In some cases, immunoprecipitations were performed in the presence of taxol or phalloidin to stabilize the microtubules and microfilaments, respectively. Fig. 2D demonstrates that under all conditions tested, Myo10 and β-tubulin were able to co-precipitate. These results, coupled with the immunochemistry shown in Fig. 2B, indicate that Myo10 may act as a linker between the microfilament and microtubule arms of the cytoskeleton in osteoclasts. To examine the function of Myo10 in osteoclasts, RNA interference was used to suppress Myo10 expression in both RAW264.7- and mouse bone marrow-derived osteoclasts. In Fig. 3A, targeting and negative control siRNAs were transfected on day 4 of osteoclast differentiation and assayed for Myo10 mRNA levels 2 days post-transfection. Three negative control double-stranded oligonucleotides failed to decrease the leve"

The aim of this study was to investigate the formation of 8-halogenated 2′-deoxyguanosines (8- halo-dGs) during inflammatory events. 8-Bromo-2′-dG (8-BrdG) and 8-chloro-2′-dG (8-CldG) were generated by treatment of MPO with hydrogen peroxide at physiological concentrations of Cl− and Br−. The formation of 8-halo-dGs with other oxidative stress biomarkers in lipopolysaccharide-treated rats was assessed by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry and immunohistochemistry using a novel monoclonal antibody (mAb8B3) to 8-BrdG-conjugated keyhole limpet hemocyanin. The antibody recognized both 8-BrdG and 8-CldG. In the liver of lipopolysaccharide-treated rats, immunostaining for 8-halo-dGs, halogenated tyrosines, and MPO were increased at 8 h, whereas those of 8-oxo-2′-dG (8-OxodG) and 3-nitrotyrosine were increased at 24 h. Urinary excretion of both 8-CldG and 8-BrdG was also observed earlier than those of 8-OxodG and modified tyrosines (3-nitrotyrosine, 3-chlorotyrosine, and 3- bromotyrosine). Moreover, the levels of the 8-halo-dGs in urine from human diabetic patients were 8-fold higher than in healthy subjects (n = 10, healthy and diabetic, p < 0.0001), whereas there was a moderate difference in 8-OxodG between the two groups (p < 0.001). Interestingly, positive mAb8B3 antibody staining was observed in liver tissue from hepatocellular carcinoma patients but not in liver tissue from human cirrhosis patients.

HOBr is also generated by eosinophil peroxidase using H2O2 and Br−, such as by the MPO-H2O2-Cl− system. Because MPO catalyzes halogenation, oxidation, and nitration (15.Eiserich J.P. Hristova M.

Halogenation is a key reaction for the formation of an MPO activity marker because the presence of halogen in the marker molecule directly indicates a contribution of the halogenating species at the site of oxidative damage. Moreover, no other halogenating pathways have been reported except for MPO and eosinophil peroxidase-derived damage. Therefore, halogenated products have the potential to be specific markers of inflammation. With respect to halogenation of nucleic acid, bromination of 2′-deoxycytidine (dC) and uracil has been reported in detail (18.Byun J. Henderson J.P. Heinecke J.W. Anal.

An antibody against N4,5-dichloro-deoxycytidine (N4,5-diCldC) was developed and used for immunohistochemistry in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-treated mice. In that inflammation model, immunopositive N4,5-diCldC staining was observed in the liver (21.Kawai Y. Morinaga H. Kondo H. Miyoshi N. Nakamura Y. Uchida K. Osawa T. J. Biol.

By contrast, there is little information on modification of dG by brominating species. In the present study, we examined the patterns of brominated dG generation in vitro. We prepared the monoclonal antibody (mAb8B3) specific to 8-halogenated dGs (8-chloro-2′-deoxyguanosine (8-CldG) and 8-bromo-2′-deoxyguanosine (8-BrdG)). Using that antibody and liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS), our results demonstrated facile formation of 8-halo-dGs in the liver and urine of rats administered LPS. Furthermore, with respect to the order of modification of dG, halogenation occurred prior to oxidation and nitration, which may be useful for evaluation of the progress of inflammatory diseases. 2′-Deoxynucleosides, DNase I, nuclease P1, 8-oxo-2′-deoxyguanosine (8-OxodG), 3,3′,5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine, bovine serum albumin (BSA), LPS from Escherichia coli, and 3,5-diaminobenzoic acid were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich. Methionine, taurine, 4-aminoantipyrine, NaOCl, metaphosphoric acid, and alkaline phosphatase were obtained from Wako Pure Chemicals Industries. Horseradish peroxidase-labeled goat anti-mouse IgG was obtained from Cappel. Anti-MPO polyclonal antibody was obtained from DAKO. HOBr was prepared from an equimolar solution of NaOCl and KBr as described (20.Henderson J.P. Byun J. Williams M.V. McCormick M.L. Parks W.C. Ridnour L.A. Heinecke J.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

As typical conditions, 1 mm dG, 20 nm MPO, 100 μm H2O2, 100 mm NaCl, and 100 μm NaBr were reacted for 60 min at 37 °C in 50 mm phosphate buffer (pH 7.4). The reaction was terminated by adding catalase to scavenge H2O2. Each component was varied as described in the text. The formation of brominated dG was quantified by LC-MS/MS, as described below. Modified dGs and their stable isotopic internal standards were prepared as follows: (a) For 8-CldG, dG (2 mm) was supplemented with nicotine (20 μm) in 50 mm phosphate buffer (pH 8.0). The reaction was initiated by adding NaOCl (1 mm) to the reaction mixture at 37 °C for 1 h and terminated by adding methionine (10 mm). (b) For 8-BrdG, dG (2 mm) was supplemented with taurine (1 mm) in 50 mm phosphate buffer (pH 7.4). The reaction was initiated by adding HOBr (1 mm) to the reaction mixture at 37 °C for 1 h and terminated by adding methionine (10 mm). (c) For 8-OxodG, dG (2 mm) was supplemented with ascorbate (1 mm) in 50 mm phosphate buffer (pH 7.4). The reaction was initiated by adding H2O2 (1 mm) to the reaction mixture at 37 °C for 4 h. 8-CldG, 8-BrdG, and 8- OxodG were isolated by reverse phase high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) (Develosil C30, 20 × 250 mm) using 10% acetonitrile containing 0.1% acetic acid at a flow rate of 6.0 ml/min with monitoring at 280 nm. The internal standards were prepared using 15N5-dG as a parent molecule by the same methods as described above. The obtained compounds were characterized by LC-MS scanning the molecular ion peaks (8-CldG, m/z 302.1; 15N5-8-CldG, m/z 307.0; 8-BrdG, m/z 345.9; 15N5-8-BrdG, m/z 350.9; 8-OxodG, m/z 284.0; 15N5-8-OxodG, m/z 288.9). LC-MS/MS analyses were performed on an API 2000 triple quadrupole mass spectrometer (Applied Biosystems) through a TurboIonSpray source. Chromatography was carried out on a Develosil ODS-HG-3 column (2.0 × 50 mm) using an Agilent 1100 HPLC system. The chromatographic separation was performed by a gradient elution as follows: 0–5 min, water containing 0.1% formic acid; 5–18 min, linear gradient to 26% acetonitrile containing 0.1% formic acid; 18–18.1 min, linear gradient to 100% acetonitrile containing 0.1% formic acid; 18.1–24 min, acetonitrile containing 0.1% formic acid; 24–24.1 min, linear gradient to water containing 0.1% formic acid; 24.1–34 min, water containing 0.1% formic acid; flow rate = 0.2 ml/min. The instrument response was optimized by infusion experiments of the standard compounds using a syringe pump at a flow rate of 5 μl/min. 8-Halo-dGs were detected using electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry in the multiple reaction monitoring mode. Specific transitions used to detect products in the positive ionization mode were those between the molecular cation of the products and the characteristic daughter ion formed from the loss of the 2′-deoxyribose moiety. The chromatographic separation was performed by a gradient elution as follows: 0–5 min, water containing 0.1% formic acid; 5–30 min, linear gradient to 50% acetonitrile containing 0.1% formic acid; 30–30.1 min, linear gradient to water containing 0.1% formic acid; 30.1–40 min, water containing 0.1% formic acid; flow rate = 0.2 ml/min. Optimization of the instrument response was performed as for 8-halo-dGs. To couple 8-BrdG to protein, the 5′-succinyl-8-BrdG derivative (suc-8-BrdG) was synthesized. Briefly, 8-BrdG (6.5 mg, 18.9 μmol) and succinic anhydride (3.8 mg, 37.8 μmol) were dissolved in pyridine (1 ml), and the mixture was kept at room temperature with stirring. After 2 days, the same amount of succinic anhydride was added, and the mixture was kept overnight at room temperature. The solution was then evaporated, and the residue was dissolved in methanol. Suc-8-BrdG was isolated by reverse phase HPLC (Develosil C30, 8 × 250 mm) using 10% acetonitrile containing 0.1% acetic acid at a flow rate of 2.0 ml/min with monitoring at 280 nm. The obtained suc-8-BrdG (2.0 mg, yield 23.4%) was identified by 1H NMR and LC-MS measurements (m/z 330, 332). The carboxyl group of the obtained suc-8-BrdG was conjugated to the amino group of KLH or BSA by the carbodiimide procedure as described previously (23.Kato Y. Mori Y. Makino Y. Morimitsu Y. Hiroi S. Ishikawa T. Osawa T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20406-20414Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). The conjugate of suc-8-BrdG and KLH (8-BrdG-KLH) (0.6 mg/ml) was emulsified with an equal volume of complete Freund's adjuvant. Six-week-old female Balb/c mice were immunized with 100 μl of this emulsion intraperitoneally. After 2 weeks, the mice were boosted with the 8-BrdG-KLH (0.2 mg/ml) emulsified with an equal volume of incomplete Freund's adjuvant. In the final boost, 100 μl of the conjugate (0.5 mg/ml) in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) was injected intravenously. Three days after the final boost, the mouse was killed, and the spleen was removed for fusion with P3/U1 myeloma cells. The fusion was carried out by polyethylene glycol, and the cells were cultured in hypoxanthine/aminopterin/thymidine selection medium. Five days after the fusion, the culture supernatants of hybridomas obtained were screened by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) using 8-BrdG-BSA and untreated BSA as the coating agents. The positive hybridomas against the 8-BrdG-BSA were cloned by the limiting dilution method. After repeated screening and cloning, four specific clones were obtained. Among them, a clone (termed mAb8B3) was used in the following experiments because of its specificity and high ability for cell growth. The indirect noncompetitive ELISA procedure has been described previously (24.Kato Y. Makino Y. Osawa T. J. Lipid Res. 1997; 38: 1334-1346Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, 100 μl of antigen in PBS was coated in wells and kept at 4 °C overnight. After washing and blocking with 4% Block Ace (Dainihon Seiyaku), 100 μl of the mAb8B3 (1/2500 dilution) in PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20 (TPBS) was added, and the wells were incubated at 37 °C for 2 h. After washing, 100 μl of anti-mouse IgG goat peroxidase-labeled antibody (1/5000 in TPBS) was added, and the wells incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. After washing, 100 μl of reaction buffer (1% (w/v) 3,3′,5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine with 0.04% H2O2 in 40 mm citrate-phosphate buffer, pH 5.0) was added. The color developing reaction was stopped by the addition of 100 μl of 1 n H3PO4. The binding of the antibody to the antigen was evaluated by measuring the optical density at 450 nm. Competitive indirect ELISA was performed for estimating the cross-reactivity of the low molecular weight compounds with the antibody. The 8-BrdG-BSA conjugate (0.05 μg/well) was used as the coating antigen. For the competitive reaction, 50 μl of competitors in PBS were mixed with an equal volume of the antibody (1/2500 dilution) in PBS containing 4% BSA. The competitor solution was kept at 4 °C overnight, and 90 μl of the mixture was used as the primary antibody. The cross-reactivity of the antibody to the competitors was expressed as B/B0, where B is the amount of antibody bound in the presence and B0 in the absence of the competitor. Female Wistar rats (7 weeks old) were given an intraperitoneal injection of LPS from E. coli (3 mg/kg body weight; Sigma) in PBS or PBS alone. The rats were sacrificed at 2, 6, 12, 24, or 72 h after LPS/PBS, and the livers were immediately frozen until analysis. Rat urine was collected every 24 h from the day before LPS treatment to 10 days after administration. MPO−/− mice were developed and maintained as described previously (25.Aratani Y. Koyama H. Nyui S. Suzuki K. Kura F. Maeda N. Infect. Immun. 1999; 67: 1828-1836Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The mice were given an intraperitoneal injection of LPS (1 mg/kg of body weight) as described above. All of the sections were counterstained with hematoxylin. Livers were collected, fixed with buffered formalin, and embedded in paraffin. In the case of livers from MPO−/− and control C57BL/6 mice, the specimens were fixed with Bouin's fluid. The 3-μm tissue sections were affixed to slides, the specimens were deparaffinized, and antigen retrieval was performed by microwave treatment in 0.01 m citrate buffer (pH 6.0) for 10 min. After cooling the slides at room temperature for 20 min, 1 n HCl was added for 30 min (for the primary antibody of modified DNA). The sections were blocked with normal rabbit serum (DAKO) in 1% BSA/PBS for 30 min and washed three times with PBS; normal swine serum (DAKO) was used for the anti-MPO antibody. The primary antibody (1/100 dilution) was reacted at 4 °C overnight. After three PBS washes, biotinylated second anti-mouse IgG antibody (DAKO, 1/100 dilution) was reacted at room temperature for 40 min. Color development was achieved using the ABC-AP (alkaline phosphatase) kit (Vectastain) with a Vector Red commercial kit as the chromogen according to the manufacturer's recommendation. The specimens were finally counterstained with hematoxylin. Anti-3-nitrotyrosine (3-NO2Tyr) antibody was prepared as described previously (26.Beckmann J.S. Ye Y.Z. Anderson P.G. Chen J. Accavitti M.A. Tarpey M.M. White C.R. Biol. Chem. Hoppe-Seyler. 1994; 375: 81-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (1081) Google Scholar). Anti-thymine glycol (Tg) antibody and dihalotyrosine antibody (27.Kato Y. Kawai Y. Morinaga H. Kondo H. Dozaki N. Kitamoto N. Osawa T. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2005; 38: 24-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) were obtained from Nikken Zeil Co. Human samples were obtained from surgical operations. The present study was approved by the Ethics Committee of Kyoto Prefectural University of Medicine. Liver tissue resected at surgery was immediately placed in liquid nitrogen and frozen at −80 °C until analysis. The thawed tissue (100 mg of wet weight) was homogenized at 4 °C in 1 ml of extraction buffer (10 mm methionine, 4 m urea, 0.2 m NaCl, 0.5% sodium N-lauroyl sarcosine, 10 mm EDTA, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5). In brief, the homogenate was mixed with 20 μl of proteinase K (20 mg/ml) and kept at 55 °C for 8 h. RNase (Qiagen; 16 μl) was added and incubated for 2 min. After vortexing for 15 s, 1 ml of phenol was mixed and gently shaken for 30 min. The mixture was centrifuged for 10 min at 3,000 rpm at 4 °C. DNA was collected with phenol and chloroform/isoamylalcohol mixture according to a conventional protocol. Prior to the enzymatic digestion of DNA, the buffer was supplemented with isotope-labeled internal standards (15N5-labeled dG, 15N5-8-CldG, 15N5-8-BrdG, and 15N5-8-OxodG). DNA was extracted as described (22.Badouard C. Masuda M. Nishino H. Cadet J. Favier A. Ravanat J.L. J. Chromatogr. B. Analyt. Technol. Biomed. Life Sci. 2005; 827: 26-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 28.Toyokuni S. Tanaka T. Hattori Y. Nishiyama Y. Yoshida A. Uchida K. Hiai H. Ochi H. Osawa T. Lab. Invest. 1997; 76: 365-374PubMed Google Scholar). Enzymatic digestion of DNA with DNase I, nuclease P1, and alkaline phosphatase was performed as reported previously (29.Huang X. Powell J. Mooney L.A. Li C. Frenkel K. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2001; 31: 1341-1351Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). After digestion, the reaction mixtures were filtered through ultrafree MC membrane (nominal molecular weight limit, 5000; Millipore) by centrifugation (10,000 rpm) to remove enzymes. 8-CldG, 8-BrdG, and 8-OxodG of the filtrates were fractionated by reverse phase HPLC, and 10 μl of the samples was injected for LC-MS/MS as described above. The multiple reaction monitoring for each compound was: 15N5-8-CldG (m/z 307.0 → 190.9), 8-CldG (m/z 302.1 → 185.9), 15N5-8-BrdG (m/z 350.9 → 235.0), 8-BrdG (m/z 345.9 → 229.9), 15N5-8-OxodG (m/z 288.9 → 173.1), and 8-OxodG (m/z 284.0 → 168.1), respectively. Tissues were homogenized in 0.5% hexadecyltrimethyl-ammonium bromide, 50 mm KH2PO4 (pH 6) and centrifuged at 10,000 rpm at 4 °C for 20 min. After 5 min, supernatant was added to the mixture of 150 μl of aqueous 2 mm H2O2 and 130 μl of aqueous 25 mm 4-aminoantipyrine/1% phenol. The solution was then reacted for 5 min. The absorbance at 510 nm was measured (A5). Instead of 2 mm H2O2/H2O, water was used as a standard (A0). The MPO activity was assessed by subtracting A0 from A5 and normalized to the liver weight. The lipid peroxidation levels were evaluated by measurement of the TBARS as described previously (30.Kobayashi Y. Nakae D. Akai H. Kishida H. Okajima E. Kitayama W. Denda A. Tsujiuchi T. Murakami A. Koshimizu K. Ohigashi H. Konishi Y. Carcinogenesis. 1998; 19: 1809-1814Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). In brief, each liver was homogenized in aqueous 1.15% KCl with 1% butylated hydroxytoluene. After centrifugation at 13,000 rpm at 4 °C for 10 min, a portion of supernatant was diluted 50× with 1.15% KCl to measure the protein concentration. The supernatant (200 μl) was added to 225 μl of 20% acetic acid and 225 μl of 0.8% thiobarbituric acid and further incubated at 100 °C for 1 h. After cooling with water, the supernatant was centrifuged at 4,000 rpm at 4 °C for 10 min, and the absorption was measured at 532 nm. TBARS data were normalized to the protein concentration. The liver was homogenized in 0.1 m phosphate buffer containing 5 mm EDTA and 1% butylated hydroxytoluene (pH 7.4). Homogenate was diluted 50× with buffer. A 100-μl volume of 25 mm metaphosphoric acid was added to the sample (400 μl) and was ultracentrifuged at 47,000 rpm at 4 °C for 30 min. A 50-μl volume of supernatant was reacted with 50 μl of 1 mg/ml o-phthalaldehyde in 900 μl of buffer for 15 min. Fluorescence was measured at an excitation of 355 nm and an emission of 460 nm. Urinary creatinine was determined by the Creatinine Test (WAKO) according to the manufacturer's recommendation. Human urine was collected as a spot sample after approval by the Nakatsugawa Municipal Hospital committee (31.Kato Y. Dozaki N. Nakamura T. Kitamoto N. Yoshida A. Naito M. Kitamura M. Osawa T. J. Clin. Biochem. Nutr. 2009; 44: 67-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The age range was 56.8 ± 10.6 in healthy patients and 56.9 ± 11.0 in diabetic patients. There were five males and five females in each group. For estimation of modified dGs, urine was supplemented with each internal standard (15N5-8-CldG, 15N5-8-BrdG, and 15N5-8-OxodG). After centrifugation at 12,000 rpm at 4 °C for 10 min, the supernatant was diluted 10× with water and then fractionated. Partial fractionations of 8-modified dG were performed by reverse phase HPLC as described above. The samples (10 μl) were analyzed using LC-MS/MS as described above. Quantification of urinary modified tyrosines, 3-bromotyrosine, 3-chlorotyrosine, and 3-NO2Tyr, was performed as described previously (31.Kato Y. Dozaki N. Nakamura T. Kitamoto N. Yoshida A. Naito M. Kitamura M. Osawa T. J. Clin. Biochem. Nutr. 2009; 44: 67-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Statistical significance of the intergroup differences of means for multiple groups were determined using the Student Newman-Keuls multiple comparisons test after one-way analysis of variance to determine variations among the group means, followed by Bartlett's test to determine the homogeneity of variance. We characterized the bromination of dG by MPO using LC-MS/MS in vitro. During the incubation of dG with MPO and H2O2 in a phosphate buffer containing NaBr, a novel product was observed on the mass chromatogram, with a characteristic pattern of multiple reaction monitoring of [M + H+]346/230 and [M + H+]348/232, with similar intensities (Fig. 1, A and B). The formation of the collision-induced fragment ion (m/z 230 and 232) indicated the liberation of the deoxyribose moiety from the modified dG. The M + 2 isotopic pattern strongly suggested the incorporation of a bromonium atom into dG (79Br and 81Br). Furthermore, this mass spectra pattern was consistent with 8-BrdG, the predominant reaction product from dG and HOBr. Therefore, the product was identified as 8-BrdG. The formation of 8-BrdG required MPO and H2O2 and was blocked by adding catalase, a scavenger of H2O2 (Fig. 1C). The reaction could not be completely prevented even in the absence of NaBr, likely because the NaCl in the buffer was contaminated with Br− (6.Henderson J.P. Byun J. Mueller D.M. Heinecke J.W. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 2052-2059Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The heme enzyme inhibitor, NaN3, inhibited the reaction. These results demonstrate that bromination of dG by MPO requires the active enzyme, Br−, and H2O2. The effects of varying the reaction conditions on the generation of 8-BrdG and 8-CldG can be seen in Fig. 2. As a basal condition, dG (1 mm) was incubated with 20 nm MPO, 100 μm H2O2, 100 mm NaCl, and 100 μm NaBr in 50 mm phosphate buffer (pH 7.4). Enzymatic bromination increased with H2O2 concentration up to 300 μm. At 100 μm of Br−, which is the physiological concentration of Br−, the yield of 8-BrdG reached a plateau. Both halogenations were completed within 30 min, and the optimal pH for 8-BrdG generation was ∼7. The production of 8-BrdG was decreased with increasing concentration of Cl−, suggesting a competitive reaction between Cl− and Br− with MPO. We prepared a monoclonal antibody to 8-BrdG (mAb8B3) using 8-BrdG-conjugated KLH as an immunogen (Fig. 3). Synthetic 8-BrdG was chemically modified for succinylation, and the succinyl moiety was then coupled to a carrier protein, KLH, as described previously (24.Kato Y. Makino Y. Osawa T. J. Lipid Res. 1997; 38: 1334-1346Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although the resulting antibody bound both 8-BrdG and 8-CldG, the reactivity against 8-BrdG was ∼10-fold higher than for 8-CldG. The antibody showed little cross-reactivity against 8-OxodG and 8-bromoguanosine and could therefore distinguish the 8-substituted moiety of dG and deoxyribose. Thus, the antibody was considered to be an antibody to 8-halo-dGs. Chlorination is considered a consequence of MPO, whereas bromination is related to both M"
https://openalex.org/W2004509972,"Neurotransmitter-sodium symporters (NSS), targets for psychostimulants and therapeutic drugs, have a critical role in neurotransmission. Whereas eukaryotic NSS show chloride-dependent transport, bacterial NSS feature Cl(-)-independent substrate transport. Recently we showed that mutation of an acidic residue near one of the sodium ion-binding sites in LeuT of Aquifex aeolicus or Tyt1 of Fusobacterium nucleatum renders substrate binding and/or transport Cl(-) dependent. We reasoned that the negative charge--provided either by Cl(-) or by the transporter itself--is required for substrate translocation. Here we show that Tyt1 reconstituted in proteoliposomes is strictly dependent on the Na(+) gradient and is stimulated by an inside negative membrane potential and by an inversely oriented proton gradient. Notably, Na(+)/substrate symport elicited H(+) efflux, indicative of Na(+)/substrate symport-coupled H(+) antiport. Mutations that render the transport phenotype Cl(-) dependent essentially abolish the pH dependence. We propose unifying features of charge balance by all NSS members with similar mechanistic features but different molecular solutions."
https://openalex.org/W2029744067,"Insulin-like growth factor binding protein (IGFBP)-5 is a secreted protein that binds to IGF and modulates IGF actions. IGFBP-5 is also found in the nucleus of mammalian cells and has transactivation activity. The structural basis of this transactivation activity and its role in mediating IGF-independent actions are not clear. Here we report that there are 2 igfbp-5 genes in zebrafish and other teleost fish. In zebrafish, igfbp-5a and -5b are expressed in spatially restricted, mostly nonoverlapping domains during early development. The IGF binding site is conserved in both zebrafish IGFBP-5s, and they are both secreted and capable of IGF binding. Both proteins contain a consensus bipartite nuclear localization signal and were found in the nucleus when introduced into cultured cells. Although zebrafish IGFBP-5b possesses transactivation activity, zebrafish IGFBP-5a lacks this activity. Mutational analysis demonstrated that 2 unique amino acids in positions 22 and 56 of IGFBP-5a are responsible for its lack of transactivation activity. These findings suggest that the duplicated zebrafish IGFBP-5s have evolved divergent regulatory mechanisms and distinct biological properties by partitioning of ancestral structural domains and provide new evidence for a conserved role of the IGF binding, nuclear localization, and transactivation domain of this multifunctional IGFBP."
https://openalex.org/W2004802638,"Cyclase-associated proteins (CAPs) are evolutionary conserved G-actin-binding proteins that regulate microfilament turnover. CAPs have a modular structure consisting of an N-terminal adenylate cyclase binding domain, a central proline-rich segment, and a C-terminal actin binding domain. Protozoan parasites of the phylum Apicomplexa, such as Cryptosporidium and the malaria parasite Plasmodium, express small CAP orthologs with homology to the C-terminal actin binding domain (C-CAP). Here, we demonstrate by reverse genetics that C-CAP is dispensable for the pathogenic Plasmodium blood stages. However, c-cap(-) parasites display a complete defect in oocyst development in the insect vector. By trans-species complementation we show that the Cryptosporidium parvum ortholog complements the Plasmodium gene functions. Purified recombinant C. parvum C-CAP protein binds actin monomers and prevents actin polymerization. The crystal structure of C. parvum C-CAP shows two monomers with a right-handed beta-helical fold intercalated at their C termini to form the putative physiological dimer. Our results reveal a specific vital role for an apicomplexan G-actin-binding protein during sporogony, the parasite replication phase that precedes formation of malaria transmission stages. This study also exemplifies how Plasmodium reverse genetics combined with biochemical and structural analyses of orthologous proteins can offer a fast track toward systematic gene characterization in apicomplexan parasites."
https://openalex.org/W1989220954,"Centrioles are conserved microtubule-based organelles with 9-fold symmetry that are essential for cilia and mitotic spindle formation. A conserved structure at the onset of centriole assembly is a ""cartwheel"" with 9-fold radial symmetry and a central tubule in its core. It remains unclear how the cartwheel is formed. The conserved centriole protein, SAS-6, is a cartwheel component that functions early in centriole formation. Here, combining biochemistry and electron microscopy, we characterize SAS-6 and show that it self-assembles into stable tetramers, which serve as building blocks for the central tubule. These results suggest that SAS-6 self-assembly may be an initial step in the formation of the cartwheel that provides the 9-fold symmetry. Electron microscopy of centrosomes identified 25-nm central tubules with repeating subunits and show that SAS-6 concentrates at the core of the cartwheel. Recombinant and native SAS-6 self-oligomerizes into tetramers with approximately 6-nm subunits, and these tetramers are components of the centrosome, suggesting that tetramers are the building blocks of the central tubule. This is further supported by the observation that elevated levels of SAS-6 in Drosophila cells resulted in higher order structures resembling central tubule morphology. Finally, in the presence of embryonic extract, SAS-6 tetramers assembled into high density complexes, providing a starting point for the eventual in vitro reconstruction of centrioles."
https://openalex.org/W2012822584,"BRCA1 C-terminal domain (BRCT)-containing proteins are found widely throughout the animal and bacteria kingdoms where they are exclusively involved in cell cycle regulation and DNA metabolism. Whereas most BRCT domains are involved in protein-protein interactions, a small subset has bona fide DNA binding activity. Here, we present the solution structure of the BRCT region of the large subunit of replication factor C bound to DNA and a model of the structure-specific complex with 5'-phosphorylated double-stranded DNA. The replication factor C BRCT domain possesses a large basic patch on one face, which includes residues that are structurally conserved and ligate the phosphate in phosphopeptide binding BRCT domains. An extra alpha-helix at the N terminus, which is required for DNA binding, inserts into the major groove and makes extensive contacts to the DNA backbone. The model of the protein-DNA complex suggests 5'-phosphate recognition by the BRCT domains of bacterial NAD(+)-dependent ligases and a nonclamp loading role for the replication factor C complex in DNA transactions."

https://openalex.org/W2084529304,"Biological networks change dynamically as protein components are synthesized and degraded. Understanding the time-dependence and, in a multicellular organism, tissue-dependence of a network leads to insight beyond a view that collapses time-varying interactions into a single static map. Conventional algorithms are limited to analyzing evolving networks by reducing them to a series of unrelated snapshots. Here we introduce an approach that groups proteins according to shared interaction patterns through a dynamical hierarchical stochastic block model. Protein membership in a block is permitted to evolve as interaction patterns shift over time and space, representing the spatial organization of cell types in a multicellular organism. The spatiotemporal evolution of the protein components are inferred from transcript profiles, using Arabidopsis root development (5 tissues, 3 temporal stages) as an example. The new model requires essentially no parameter tuning, out-performs existing snapshot-based methods, identifies protein modules recruited to specific cell types and developmental stages, and could have broad application to social networks and other similar dynamic systems."
https://openalex.org/W2170520703,"Lipoxygenases (LOXs) are iron-containing enzymes that play critical roles in plants and animals. As yet, metal atom extraction, reconstitution, and substitution have not been successfully applied to soybean LOX-1 [Glycine max (L.) Merrill], a prototype member of the LOX family that is widely used in structural and kinetic studies. Here, tryptic digestion of native LOX-1, used as a control, allowed us to isolate the 60-kDa C-terminal region (termed miniLOX), that retains the catalytically active iron in a more accessible position. Then, iron was removed to obtain an unprecedented apo-miniLOX, which was reconstituted and substituted with different metal ions. These forms of miniLOX were characterized vs. native LOX-1 by kinetic analysis, near UV circular dichroism, steady-state fluorescence, and fluorescence resonance energy transfer. MiniLOX showed a 2-fold increase in the membrane-binding affinity compared with native LOX-1 and a remarkable 4-fold increase compared with apo-miniLOX (K(d)=9.2+/-1.0, 17.9+/-2.0, and 45.4+/-4.3 microM, respectively). Furthermore, miniLOX reconstituted with Fe(II) or Fe(III) partially recovered its membrane-binding ability (K(d)=21.4+/-2.4 and 18.9+/-5.5 microM, respectively), overall supporting a novel noncatalytic role for iron in the LOX family."
https://openalex.org/W2021310940,"Bacterial acyl carrier protein (ACP) is essential for the synthesis of fatty acids and serves as the major acyl donor for the formation of phospholipids and other lipid products. Acyl-ACP encloses attached fatty acyl groups in a hydrophobic pocket within a four-helix bundle, but must at least partially unfold to present the acyl chain to the active sites of its multiple enzyme partners. To further examine the constraints of ACP structure and function, we have constructed a cyclic version of Vibrio harveyi ACP, using split-intein technology to covalently join its closely apposed N and C termini. Cyclization stabilized ACP in a folded helical conformation as indicated by gel electrophoresis, circular dichroism, fluorescence, and mass spectrometry. Molecular dynamics simulations also indicated overall decreased polypeptide chain mobility in cyclic ACP, although no major conformational rearrangements over a 10-ns period were noted. In vivo complementation assays revealed that cyclic ACP can functionally replace the linear wild-type protein and support growth of an Escherichia coli ACP-null mutant strain. Cyclization of a folding-deficient ACP mutant (F50A) both restored its ability to adopt a folded conformation and enhanced complementation of growth. Our results thus suggest that ACP must be able to adopt a folded conformation for biological activity, and that its function does not require complete unfolding of the protein. Bacterial acyl carrier protein (ACP) is essential for the synthesis of fatty acids and serves as the major acyl donor for the formation of phospholipids and other lipid products. Acyl-ACP encloses attached fatty acyl groups in a hydrophobic pocket within a four-helix bundle, but must at least partially unfold to present the acyl chain to the active sites of its multiple enzyme partners.

Over two dozen nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and x-ray crystal structures have revealed a conserved “ACP fold” consisting of a four-helix bundle (1.Byers D.M. Gong H. Biochem.

Fatty acids covalently attached to the phosphopantetheine prosthetic group at the N-terminal end of helix II are enclosed within the hydrophobic interior of this bundle, interacting predominantly with residues on helices II-IV (2.Kim Y.

The acidic nature of ACP (pI ∼ 4) contributes to a highly dynamic and flexible structure in solution, and some ACPs exhibit features characteristic of natively unfolded proteins (1.Byers D.M. Gong H. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2007; 85: 649-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). For example, Vibrio harveyi ACP is largely unfolded at neutral pH, but its helical conformation can be stabilized by charge neutralization (i.e. at low pH or by residue replacements) (13.Keating M.M. Gong H. Byers D.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1601: 208-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), by binding of divalent cations to helix II (10.Gong H. Murphy A. McMaster C.R. Byers D.M. J.

Clearly, for acyl transfer to occur from ACP to a partner enzyme a significant conformational change must occur to allow release of the sequestered acyl chain to the enzyme active site. This unfolding event thus represents a hallmark of ACP function and suggests that the dynamic nature of ACP is essential for cell survival. An important question is the mechanism and extent to which ACP must unfold to transfer its acyl chain to or from enzyme partners. In this study, we have created cyclic analogues of V. harveyi ACP to examine the effects on conformational stability and constraints on biological activity. Cyclization was achieved by split-intein mediated in vivo ligation of the ACP N- and C termini (19.Scott C.P. Abel-Santos E. Wall M. Wahnon D.C. Benkovic S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1999; 96: 13638-13643Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). Several biophysical approaches indicated that the cyclic ACP is stabilized in a folded conformation. Strikingly, expression of the cyclic ACP in Escherichia coli lacking endogenous (i.e. linear) ACP resulted in complementation of growth close to wild-type levels, indicating that this major structural constraint does not abolish interactions with any of the ACP multiple essential partner enzymes. Our data provide insight into ACP structure-function relationships and the dynamic properties relevant to its biological function. PCR reactions were carried out using Phusion DNA Polymerase (Finnzymes) and commercially synthesized primers (Integrated DNA Technologies). All PCR products were subcloned into cloning vector pJET1.2 (Fermentas), except for products from inverse PCR reactions, which were directly circularized by blunt-end ligation. Complete primer sequences are given in supplemental Table S1; bacterial strains and plasmids used in this study are listed in supplemental Table S2.

Liu, unpublished data. with primer pairs IC-for/IC-rev and IN-for/INHIS-rev, respectively; the products were fused by anneal-extension PCR and subsequently amplified using primers IC-for/INHIS-rev. The complete product was cloned into pT (a derivative of the pTWIN1 vector from New England Biolabs) 4G. Volkmann, unpublished data. using SacI and PstI, creating pTIC(NS)INH. The coding regions of the V. harveyi ACP L46W and F50A mutants were amplified from pGEX-L46W (15.Gong H. Murphy P.W. Langille G.M. Minielly S.J. Murphy A. McMaster C.R. Byers D.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2008; 1784: 1835-1843Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar) and pGEX-F50A (20.Flaman A.S. Chen J.M. Van Iderstine S.C. Byers D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 35934-35939Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), respectively, using primers ACP-for/ACP-rev and cloned into pTIC(NS)INH using NheI and SapI, resulting in pTCYC-L46W and pTCYC-F50A. The complete open-reading frames of the cyclization constructs from the latter plasmids were transferred into the pMAL vector (New England Biolabs) using NdeI and PstI, thereby replacing the maltose-binding protein (MBP) gene. All splicing-deficient L46W constructs (with C1A/N435A mutations in the intein sequence) were made similarly, but using primer pairs IC-for/ICMUT-rev and INMUT-for/INHIS-rev in the initial PCR. For in vitro purification of the linL46W-encoded DNA, the C-terminal portion of GST (starting at an internal MscI-site), and the L46W sequence were amplified using primer pairs GSTC-for/GSTC-rev and LINL46W-for/LINL46W-rev, respectively; products were fused by anneal-extension PCR and subsequently amplified using primers GSTC-for/LINL46W-rev. This GSTC-L46W fragment was then cloned into pGEX-L46W using MscI and AfeI, creating pGEX-linL46W. For in vivo expression of linL46W, the coding sequence was amplified from pGEX-linL46W with primers LINL46W-for2/LINL46W-rev2, and cloned into pMAL using NdeI and PstI, resulting in plasmid pMLIN-L46W. For expression of linF50A in vivo, inverse PCR was performed on the linL46W sequence (present in pJET1.2) using primers LINF50A-for/LINF50A-rev, which were 5′-phosphorylated using T4 phosphonucleotide kinase (Fermentas). The linF50A sequence was then cloned into pMAL using NdeI and PstI, to give pMLIN-F50A. E. coli BL21(DE3)pLysS cells harboring either pTCYC-L46W or pTPRE-L46W-mut were grown in LB medium (containing 50 μg/ml ampicillin and 34 μg/ml chloramphenicol) to an A595 of 0.6. Isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) was then added to a final concentration of 0.8 mm, and cells were grown for an additional 18 h at room temperature. Cells were harvested, lysed in reducing SDS sample buffer, and boiled for 5 min. To monitor expression and cyclization total cell lysates were separated by SDS-PAGE (12.5% NEXT gel (Mandel Scientific) in combination with a conventional 4% Laemmli stacking gel), followed by staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue G-250 or Western transfer to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. Western blots were probed with a primary mouse anti-His antibody (Sigma) and a secondary rabbit anti-mouse IgG horseradish peroxidase-linked antibody (GE Healthcare). Chemiluminescence was performed with the ECL Plus Western Detection Kit (GE Healthcare), and signals were visualized on x-ray film. To produce linL46W or linF50A protein, BL21(DE3)pLysS cells harboring the pGEX-linL46W (15.Gong H. Murphy P.W. Langille G.M. Minielly S.J. Murphy A. McMaster C.R. Byers D.M. Biochim. Biophys.

Cells were harvested and protein purified as previously (20.Flaman A.S. Chen J.M. Van Iderstine S.C. Byers D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 35934-35939Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) with the additional cell lysis step using progressively smaller bore needles prior to sonication. The eluate of the glutathione-Sepharose 4B (GE LifeSciences) was brought to 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm CaCl2, and incubated with Factor Xa (Hematological Technologies Inc.; 16 μg/mg of protein) at 4 °C for 48 h. Following incubation, the solution was heated (5 min, 95 °C) and subjected to centrifugation (23 °C, 13,000 × g, 10 min) to pellet precipitated GST and Factor Xa. The resultant supernatant was dialyzed into buffer A (10 mm MES (pH 6.0), 2 mm dithiothreitol) and then filtered (0.22 μm) prior to Source15Q (GE Healthcare, 6 ml packed bed volume per 100 ml of culture) anion exchange chromatography using a Waters 650 protein chromatography system. Bound protein was eluted using a linear gradient (1 ml/min flow rate) from 0–1 m NaCl in buffer A. SDS-15% PAGE (160 V, 60 min) and native-20% PAGE (160 V, 90 min) (20.Flaman A.S. Chen J.M.

To obtain cycL46W or cycF50A protein, BL21(DE3)pLysS cells harboring pTCYC-L46W or pTCYC-F50A were induced, harvested, resuspended in buffer A, and lysed as above. After centrifugation (4 °C, 27,000 × g, 20 min), the soluble protein fraction was heated for 10 min at 95 °C, cooled on ice for 10 min, and subjected to centrifugation (4 °C, 14,000 × g, 10 min). The supernatant containing heat-stabile ACP was filtered (0.22 μm) and injected on a Superose 6 10/300 GL size exclusion column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated with buffer A. Fractions found to contain cycL46W were pooled and further purified using SOURCE 15Q anion exchange chromatography as above. Cyclic ACP thus prepared was predominantly in its apo form, and was used for biophysical comparison with the corresponding apo forms of linear ACP. Protein concentrations were determined using the microBCA protein assay (Thermo Scientific). All fluorescence measurements were carried out on a Photon Technology International (PTI) QuantaMaster-4CW in a 3 mm semi-micro cuvette (Hellma) at 25 °C. Slit widths were set at 5 nm for both excitation and emission monochromators in all fluorescence experiments. ACPs diluted to 1 μm in 10 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.0), 0.1 mm EDTA were excited at 296 nm with emission spectra recorded from 300–450 nm in photon-counting mode with an integration time of 1 s both before and after the addition of MgSO4 (10 mm final concentration). All fluorescence intensities were corrected for the Raman band from the solvent. Spectra were recorded on a J-810 spectropolarimeter (Jasco) at 25 °C using a 0.1 cm water-jacketed cell. ACPs were diluted to 1 μm in 10 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.0), 0.1 mm EDTA, and spectra were recorded from 190–260 nm in continuous mode with a speed of 20 nm/min before or immediately after the addition of MgSO4 (10 mm final concentration). LC-MS/MS was performed using a nanoflow Ultimate system (LC Packings) interfaced to the nanoflow ESI source of a hybrid triple quadrupole linear ion trap (Qtrap) mass spectrometer (Applied Biosystems). Samples were sprayed through a distal coated fused silica needle, 75-μm ID with 15-μm ID tip (New Objectives). Solvent A consisted of 0.1% (v/v) formic acid in water/acetonitrile (98:2), while solvent B consisted of 0.1% (v/v) formic acid in acetonitrile/water (98:2). For peptide analysis, native PAGE-resolved protein was digested with sequencing-grade trypsin (Promega) for 7.5 h at 37 °C, and the tryptic peptides were resuspended in 30 μl of 5% acetonitrile, 0.5% formic acid. Proteolysis products were injected onto an Onyx monolithic C18 capillary column (0.1 × 150 mm, Phenomenex) and eluted with a 3–30% solvent B gradient over 35 min at a flow rate of 1 μl/min. Spectra were acquired using Information Dependent Acquisition mode. For intact protein LC-MS (21.Konermann L. Douglas D.J. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 12296-12302Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar), purified protein was desalted over POROS R2 media (Applied Biosystems) using the manufacturer's guidelines, and resuspended in 10% acetonitrile, 0.5% formic acid. Protein was subjected to LC-MS on an Onyx monolithic C18 capillary column (0.1 × 50 mm, Phenomenex) at a flow rate of 3 μl/min. The gradient was 10–70% solvent B over 20 min, and spectra were acquired in EMS mode (400–1700 m/z). To create initial in silico structures for linL46W and cycL46W, one of the 20 NMR solution structures of E. coli apo-ACP (PDB ID 2K92 (4.Wu B.N. Zhang Y.M. Rock C.O. Zheng J.J. Protein Sci. 2009; 18: 240-246PubMed Google Scholar)) was selected. The mutation equivalent to V. harveyi L46W was made in 2K92 using VMD 1.8.7 (22.Humphrey W. Dalke A. Schulten K. J. Mol. Graphics. 1996; 14: 33-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (38358) Google Scholar), and the structure was loaded into PyMol 1.2r1 (23.De Lano, W. (2002) The PyMol Molecular Graphics System, San Carlos, CAGoogle Scholar) to complete the construction. For cycL46W, Gly, Ser, and Ala were added sequentially to the C terminus of L46W adjusting the bond dihedrals to bring the termini as close as possible. MD simulations were performed with NAMD V 2.7b1 (24.Phillips J.C. Braun R. Wang W. Gumbart J. Tajkhorshid E. Villa E. Chipot C. Skeel R.D. Kalé L. Schulten K. J. Comput. Chem. 2005; 26: 1781-1802Crossref PubMed Scopus (13139) Google Scholar) using CHARMM22 (25.Mackerell Jr., A.D. Bashford D. Bellot M. Dunbrack Jr., R.L. Evanseck J.D. Field M.J. Fischer S. Gao J.

Each simulation was carried out in a sphere of explicit water molecules at 310 K using Langevin temperature control and was set up with two periods: steepest descent minimization (1 ns; 500,000 steps) and equilibration (10 ns; 5,000,000 steps). To ensure constructs had adopted an equilibration structure, the average root mean square deviation (for backbone atoms) was calculated over the course of the simulation. Sausage representation figures for linL46W and cycL46W were created using MOLMOL 2.6.0 (26.Koradi R. Billeter M. Wüthrich K. J. Mol. Graph. 1996; 14: 51-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (6487) Google Scholar). Strain CY1861 carries plasmid pCY765 that was constructed from plasmids pNRD25 (27.De Lay N.R. Cronan J.E. J. Bacteriol. 2006; 188: 287-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), pBAD30 (28.Guzman L.M. Belin D. Carson M.J. Beckwith J. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 4121-4130Crossref PubMed Scopus (3938) Google Scholar), and p34S-Sm2 (29.Dennis J.J. Zylstra G.J. BioTechniques. 1998; 25 (776): 772-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The acpP coding sequence plus flanking sequences was excised from pNRD25 with BamHI and FspI and ligated to pBAD30 cut with the same enzymes. The resulting intermediate plasmid was digested with FspI and ligated to a 2067-bp HincII fragment encoding spectinomycin resistance from p34S-Sm2 to give pCY765 (insertion into the FspI site inactivated the pBAD30 β-lactamase gene). CY1878, the host strain for the plasmid was derived from strain DY329 (30.Yu D. Ellis H.M. Lee E.C. Jenkins N.A. Copeland N.G. Court D.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2000; 97: 5978-5983Crossref PubMed Scopus (1363) Google Scholar) by two steps of transduction with P1vir lysates. First, the temperature-sensitive λ phage and its closely linked nadA::Tn10 element were removed from the chromosome by transduction with a P1 stock grown on a wild-type strain. Transductants that grew in the absence of biotin and nicotinic acid were selected and screened for growth at 42 °C. One of these transductants was then transformed to spectinomycin resistance with pCY765. A transformant was then transduced to chloramphenicol resistance in the presence of arabinose with a P1 phage lysate grown on the ΔacpP fabF::cml strain, NRD62 (27.De Lay N.R. Cronan J.E. J. Bacteriol. 2006; 188: 287-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Transductants resistant to chloramphenicol and spectinomycin were screened for arabinose-dependent growth to give strain CY1861. For in vivo complementation assays, single colonies of CY1861 transformed with indicated plasmids were resuspended in 50 μl of LB medium supplemented with 50 μg/ml spectinomycin and 100 μg/ml ampicillin (LB-SA). Five microliters of this resuspension were used to inoculate 245 μl of LB-SA additionally supplemented with either 0.2% arabinose or 0.2% glucose/0.8 mm IPTG in a 96-well plate. The optical density (A595) was recorded (t = 0), and the plate incubated at 37 °C and 400 rpm with measurements of A595 taken every 20–30 min. Absorbance values were subtracted from the t = 0 readings of individual wells, and multiplied by 4 to normalize values. IPTG had no effect on growth in 0.2% arabinose, indicating that none of the constructs are toxic. The flexibility and dynamic properties of ACP are thought to be essential for its function (6.Zhang Y.M. Rao M.S. Heath R.J. Price A.C. Olson A.J. Rock C.O. White S.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 8231-8238Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). As the N and C termini of ACP are both mobile (16.Chan D.I. Stockner T. Tieleman D.P. Vogel H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 33620-33629Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) and in relatively close proximity, we used an intein-mediated approach to constrain this flexibility by constructing a cyclic version of V. harveyi ACP. The N-terminal splicing domain of the Ssp GyrB intein (residues 1–111, followed by a hepta-histidine tag; INH) (31.Perler F.B. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 383-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar) was fused to the C terminus of ACP, while the C-terminal splicing domain (residues 393–435; IC) was fused to the ACP N terminus (plasmid pTCYC-L46W). The L46W mutant of ACP was chosen because the tryptophan at position 46 (replacing leucine in the wild-type V. harveyi ACP) has been shown to be sensitive to the folding state of the protein, without affecting its secondary structure or substrate properties with a variety of ACP-dependent enzymes (15.Gong H. Murphy P.W. Langille G.M. Minielly S.J. Murphy A. McMaster C.R. Byers D.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2008; 1784: 1835-1843Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). After trans-splicing, the cyclic ACP L46W mutant (cycL46W) would therefore have its N and C termini connected by a three amino acid linker (Gly-Ser-Ala) (Fig. 1A). Furthermore, a control construct was made (pTPRE-L46W-mut), in which the first and last intein residues were mutated to Ala to inhibit intein-mediated trans-splicing and possible cleavage reactions. When these constructs were expressed in E. coli BL21(DE3)pLysS, the control construct showed an induced protein species at ∼31 kDa on SDS-PAGE that reacted with anti-His tag antibodies (Fig. 1B) and thus corresponds to the splicing- and cleavage-deficient split-intein L46W construct (preL46Wmut) protein. In contrast, the construct competent for cyclization revealed two induced protein species, one migrating at ∼14 kDa and the other below 10 kDa (Fig. 1B). The 14-kDa protein reacted with anti-His antibodies and thus likely corresponds to the INH split-intein part (13.3 kDa). The smaller protein was identified as the IC split-intein part (5.1 kDa) based on in-gel trypsin digestion and MS/MS analysis. The detection of both split-intein parts as separate protein species indicated that the cyclization construct underwent a complete reaction in vivo as judged from the absence of any unspliced protein precursor (preL46W). However, an induced band corresponding to ACP was not apparent. ACP is a highly acidic protein that resolves well in native PAGE (32.Rock C.O. Cronan Jr., J.E. Armitage I.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 2669-2674Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and hence we used this method to further examine soluble protein extracts from E. coli expressing the cyclization and control constructs (Fig. 1C). The splicing control construct (pTPRE-L46W-mut) lysate revealed a heavily stained protein band that reacted with anti-His antibodies in Western blotting, and thus represents the splicing-deficient preL46Wmut protein. The cyclization construct (pTCYC-L46W) lysate showed a protein band of similar intensity and mobility, which likely corresponds to the His-tagged IN split-intein fragment (INH) based on Western blotting and co-migration with INH purified by Ni-NTA affinity chromatography. Interestingly, and in contrast to the pTPRE-L46W-mut lysate, the pTCYC-L46W lysate showed the presence of an additional protein species near the bottom of the native gel, which could represent the cyclized L46W (cycL46W) protein. To verify this, the protein suspected to be cycL46W was digested with trypsin (in-gel) and analyzed by LC-MS/MS. An [M+3H]3+ peptide ion with an m/z value of 846.84 was identified, for which the MS/MS spectrum was in excellent agreement with the amino acid sequence ITTVQAAIDYVNSAQGSASNIEER (Fig. 2). In this peptide, residues 1–15 (ITTVQAAIDYVNSAQ) correspond to the C-terminal residues of V. harveyi ACP, whereas residues 19–24 (SNIEER) represent the N terminus. The ACP C and N termini are linked by the residues GSA. This peptide thus has the expected amino acid sequence of the cycL46W protein trypsin fragment extending across the region of cyclization, with the peptide bond between Gly and Ser being the exact ligation point between the N and C termini. These results show that the cycL46W protein was successfully created in vivo by split-intein-mediated trans-splicing. As the cycL46W protein was not clearly evident when lysates were fractionated by SDS-PAGE, we examined the migration behavior of purified cycL46W in comparison to the corresponding linear ACP bearing the exact same amino acid sequence (linL46W). CycL46W migrated as a diffuse band with an apparent molecular mass of ∼12 kDa (Fig. 3A). The fact that cycL46W stains poorly with Coomassie Blue and its migration overlaps with that of the INH split-intein part (13.3 kDa) may explain why the protein was not clearly visible upon separation of the whole cell lysates by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1B). Notably, the cycL46W protein migrated faster than the linL46W protein (∼20 kDa, Fig. 3A), which like many ACPs exhibits anomalous SDS-PAGE mobility (1.Byers D.M. Gong H. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2007; 85: 649-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar), indicating that cycL46W has a more compact structure. This conclusion is supported by the observation that cycL46W also migrated faster than linL46W in a conformationally sensitive native PAGE system (Fig. 3B). To further examine the effect of cyclization on ACP structure in solution, we used a variety of biophysical methods to analyze the conformation of both cycL46W and linL46W in response to Mg2+ ions, which are known to induce a folded helical conformation upon binding to V. harveyi ACP at physiological pH (10.Gong H.
