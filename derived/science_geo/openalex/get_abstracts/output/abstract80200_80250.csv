https://openalex.org/W2076899085,"The variable portion of an immunoglobulin heavy chain gene is assembled from at least three discontinuous segments of DNA, the V, D and J regions. We have characterized a 30 kb segment of the human genome that plays a critical role in the formation of this variable region as well as in the expression of the two heavy chains that appear earliest in immunocyte ontogeny, the mu and delta chains. This region encodes nine J-like segments, an interspersed D segment, recombination signals and the genes responsible for the production of both mu and delta heavy chains. Six of the nine germline J-like genes appear to be active and easily account for most of the known human heavy chain amino acid sequences. Three of the J-like genes are pseudogenes. The large number of human J region genes and, hence, their greater potential for generating diversity as compared to the that of the mouse J region genes appears to result from recent genetic duplications. To assess this potential, we have analyzed two recombinant genes involving this region. One of these, a V-D-J recombinant, is likely to be an active gene; the other, an aberrant D-J recombinant. A comparison of the structures of these D regions raises the possibility that they are mosaics formed by recombination between D segments."
https://openalex.org/W2097971843,"In previous studies of transcription and splicing of the ribosomal RNA precursor in isolated Tetrahymena nuclei, we found that the intervening sequence (IVS) was excised as a unique linear RNA molecule and was subsequently cyclized. In the present work, transcription at low monovalent cation concentration is found to inhibit splicing and to lead to the accumulation of a splicing intermediate. This intermediate contains splicing activity that either is tightly bound to the RNA or is part of the RNA molecule itself. The intermediate is able to complete the excision of the IVS when it is incubated with a monovalent cation (75 mM (NH4)2SO4), a divalent cation (5-10 mM MgCl2) and a guanosine compound (1 microM GTP, GDP, GMP or guanosine). ATP, UTP, CTP and guanosine compounds without 2' and 3' hydroxyl groups are inactive in causing excision of the IVS. Accurate excision of the IVS, cyclization of the IVS and (apparently) ligation of the 26S rRNA sequences bordering the IVS all take place under these conditions, suggesting that a single activity is responsible for all three reactions. During excision of the IVS, the 3' hydroxyl of the guanosine moiety becomes linked to the 5' end of the IVS RNA via a normal phosphodiester bond. When GTP is used to drive the reaction, it is added intact without hydrolysis. Based on these results, we propose that Tetrahymena pre-rRNA splicing occurs by a phosphoester transferase mechanism. According to this model, the guanosine cofactor provides the free 3' hydroxyl necessary to initiate a series of three transfers that results in splicing of the pre-rRNA and cyclization of the excised IVS."

https://openalex.org/W2159072093,"We have screened different cultured cell lines established from human tumors for the ability of their DNAs to induce transformed foci in NIH/3T3 cells. Based on restriction endonuclease digestions and the presence of human sequences in mouse transformants, we conclude that five of these human tumor cell lines contain a gene or genes capable of transforming mouse cells and that at least three different transforming genes are present in these five lines. Three cell lines, two derived from lung carcinomas and one derived from a colon carcinoma, transfer the same or closely related human genes. If these transforming genes are mediating the tumorigenic state of the human cells, then our results indicate that overlapping pathways leading to tumorigenesis may arise independently."
https://openalex.org/W2045304765,"The endothelia of microvessels isolated from mouse brain by mechanical means are rich in gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase; however, the enzyme often disappears when the cells migrate or proliferate from the microvessel isolates. In an endothelial cell line derived from similar isolates and negative for gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase, the enzyme could be induced in the endothelial cells when they were cocultured with glial cells. Thus there may be a requirement for continuous induction of gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase in brain microvessels by adjacent glial cells."
https://openalex.org/W2085369521,"The immune response to phosphorylcholine in BALB/c mice has been well characterized. Amino acid sequence analyses of heavy-chain variable (VH) regions from 19 myeloma and hybridoma immunoglobulins binding phosphorylcholine show that 10 are identical (the prototype T15 VH sequence) and 9 are distinct variants differing by one to eight residues. A T15 VH DNA probe was used to isolate four closely related members of the T15 VH gene family, including one encoding the T15 VH sequence, from a sperm genomic library. A comparison of the protein and germline VH sequences suggested that most of the immune response to phosphorylcholine is derived from the T15 germline VH gene segment. The variant heavy chains from the M167 and M603 α immunoglobulins differ in their VH protein sequences from T15 by eight and three residues, respectively. We analyzed the somatic variability in and around the coding regions of these two variant VH genes by comparing them with the corresponding regions of the appropriate germline gene segments. The somatic variation has three properties: it is extensive and is found in flanking as well as coding sequences (for example, at least 44 substitutions for the M167 sequence and 10 substitutions for the M603 sequence); in the coding regions, it includes many silent as well as replacement substitutions; and it is focal in nature and centered around the rearranged VH genes. Although the mutations extend into the neighboring upstream and downstream flanking sequences, sequences approximately 5 kb upstream and downstream from the VH genes show no substitutions. Moreover, the associated heavy-chain constant genes (Cα from both variant α genes are unaltered, indicating that a closely linked and coexpressed gene is unmutated. We conclude that this somatic variation is generated by a special hypermutational mechanism highly localized in its site of execution and highly restricted in its time of operation during B-cell development."

https://openalex.org/W2073329016,"Expression of the genes for variant surface glycoproteins 117 and 118 in Trypanosoma brucei is accompanied by the appearance of an extra copy of these genes, the expression-linked copy, which differs in the surrounding restriction enzyme sites from the corresponding basic copy of the genes. We present direct evidence that the expression-linked copy is the one used for messenger RNA synthesis. By S1-nuclease-protection experiments we show that cloned basic-copy genes contain the nucleotide sequence of the corresponding messenger RNA except for the last 100 to 150 nucleotides before the poly(A) tail. Comparison of the 3'-terminal sequence of the 117 basic-copy gene and the 117 complementary DNA shows that this region differs by multiple point mutations, insertions and deletions, the differences starting within the coding sequence. Genomic blots demonstrate that a Bsp I site in the 3'-terminal part of the 118 complementary DNA is present in the expression-linked copy but not in the basic-copy gene. We conclude that expression-linked copies are the active genes, and that the generation of expression-linked copies involves a duplication--transposition in which the 3' end of the gene is replaced."
https://openalex.org/W2029399500,"The molecular defect in four Kurdish Jews with homozygous, mRNA-deficient beta zero thalassemia was investigated. Electrophoretic profiles of pulse-labeled alpha- and beta-globin RNAs are similar to those of non-thalassemics; therefore, at least one of the thalassemic beta-globin alleles is transcribed. During a 30 min actinomycin D chase, most of the alpha- and beta-globin mRNA precursors and processing intermediates are converted to mRNA-sized RNA. Thalassemic and non-thalassemic beta-globin RNAs are indistinguishable, as determined by S1 nuclease mapping and RNA blotting. Non-thalassemic beta-globin mRNA is stable during a 30 min actinomycin chase, but 30%-75% of the thalassemic mRNA-sized molecules is degraded during that period. We conclude that the absence of beta-globin mRNA in this disease results from rapid turnover of beta-globin mRNA-sized molecules."
https://openalex.org/W2076451909,"The SV40 early mRNAs encode large (T) and small (t) tumor antigens. During the lytic cycle, the 5' termini of the early mRNAs undergo a shift: shortly after infection only an initiation site downstream from the TATA box is utilized; later an upstream initiation site becomes prominent. Both initiation sites are utilized in an in vitro transcription extract. D2T, a T antigen analog, specifically represses transcription in vitro from both initiation sites, but at different concentrations. Binding of D2T to site I suppresses initiation from the site downstream of the TATA box; binding to sites II and I suppresses initiation from the upstream site. The role of T antigen binding in repression of transcription and in the shift of initiation sites on the early strand is discussed."

https://openalex.org/W2022692782,"The activities of cyclic nucleotide phosphohydrolase, an enzyme marker for oligodendrocytes, and glutamine synthetase, an enzyme marker for astrocytes, were studied at early (21 to 26) and late (82 to 88) cell passages. The activity of cyclic nucleotide phosphohydrolase was markedly high and that of glutamine synthetase was low in the early passages, but this relation was reversed in the late passages. These findings suggest a ""transdifferentiation"" of C6 glial cells with passage in culture."
https://openalex.org/W1608590586,"L-Lysine alpha-oxidase from Trichoderma viride Y244-2 has been purified to homogeneity. The enzyme shows absorption maxima at 277, 388, and 466 nm and a shoulder around 490 nm and contains 2 mol of FAD/mol of enzyme. The enzyme has a molecular weight of approximately 116,000 and consists of two subunits identical in molecular weight (about 56,000). In addition to L-lysine, L-ornithine, L-phenylalanine, L-tyrosine, L-arginine, and L-histidine are oxidized by the enzyme to a lesser extent. Several lysine analogs such as delta-hydroxylysine are oxidized efficiently. Balance studies showed that 1 mol of L-lysine is converted to an equimolar amount of alpha-keto-epsilon-aminocaproate, ammonia, and hydrogen peroxide with the consumption of 1 mol of oxygen. alpha-Keto-epsilon-aminocaproate spontaneously is dehydrated intramolecularly into delta 1-piperideine-2-carboxylate in the presence of catalase, and is oxidatively decarboxylated into delta-aminovalerate in the absence of catalase. The Michaelis constants are as follows: 0.04 mM for L-lysine, 0.44 mM for L-ornithine, 14 mM for L-phenylalanine, and 1.6 mM for oxygen with L-lysine."
https://openalex.org/W1995080182,The LexA protein of Escherichia coli was purified to more than 96% purity from cells harboring a recombinant plasmid carrying the lexA gene with the lacZ promoter sequence. The amino acid composition of the LexA protein and its amino-terminal sequence were analyzed. The results are in agreement with the prediction from the nucleotide sequence of the lexA gene. The LexA protein is cleaved into two polypeptides by E. coli RecA protein in the presence of ATP and single-stranded DNA. The site of the specific cleavage was determined by analyzing amino acid sequences of the cleaved products at the amino and carboxyl termini. The cleavage of the LexA protein by the RecA protein was found to occur at a single site between Ala84 and Gly85.
https://openalex.org/W2164118584,"Primordial germ cells (PGCs) of Xenopus laevis are highly migratory. The last section of their migratory pathway is through the dorsal mesentery of the tadpole gut. This in vivo pathway is rich in fibronectin, a glycoprotein that promotes cell adhesion and migration in vitro. Isolated PGCs are associated with cells from the mesentery and with fibronectin. Treatment with trypsin removes both the mesentery cells and the fibronectin. The PGCs do not appear to resynthesize detectable fibronectin in vitro. In contrast, cultured adult mesentery epithelial cells synthesize large amounts of fibronectin and lay it down in subcellular fibrils that align with intracellular microfilament bundles. PGCs plated on cultured mesentery cell layers adhere to them, elongate and align with the microfilament bundles of the mesentery cells. PGCs adherent to mesentery cell layers are closely associated with fibronectin; moreover, F(ab)2 fragments of anti-Xenopus fibronectin IgG inhibit the adhesion and spreading of PGCs on the mesentery. These results indicate that PGCs can adhere to mesentery cells via fibronectin produced by the latter cells and suggest that fibronectin may be involved in the migration of PGCs in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W1966248042,"A specific precipitating antibody against chicken gizzard myosin light chain kinase (MLCK) has been produced in rabbits. The antibody inhibited enzyme activity in a dose-dependent manner with 11 moles of antibody required to inhibit 80% of the activity of one mole MLCK. Crude homogenates from various chicken tissues were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and the proteins were transferred onto nitrocellulose sheets and reacted with antibody. In each case, the antibody bound to only one protein with a molecular weight of approximately 130,000. These data suggest the MLCK present in all types of muscle as well as non-muscle tissues is of the same molecular weight. Indirect immunofluorescent microscopy of non-muscle tissue culture cells revealed MLCK to be localized in the spindle apparatus and midbody of mitotic cells and on the stress fibers and in the nucleolus of interphase cells. The nucleolar localization was confirmed by electron microscopy and shown to be restricted to the fibrillar region. In myofibrils isolated from skeletal and cardiac muscle, anti-MLCK decorated the actin-containing I bands of the sarcomere. These results are consistent with the suggestion that MLCK and calmodulin are intermediates in the regulation of cell motility by calcium."

https://openalex.org/W1578456230,"The protein kinase associated with the purified epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor from membrane (Mr = 150,000) or vesicle (Mr = 170,000) preparations of A-431 cells was shown to catalyze the phosphorylation of the peptide Leu-Glu-Asp-Ala-Glu-Tyr-Ala-Ala-Arg-Arg-Arg-Gly at the tyrosine residue. EGF enhanced peptide phosphorylation by 3-5-fold. The steady state kinetic analysis of the purified kinase from membranes showed that the reaction mechanism was of the sequential type in either the presence of absence of EGF. Thus, the peptide and ATP must bind to the enzyme before any product is released. Both neurotensin 8-13 and kyotorphin were inhibitors but not substrates of the protein kinase. Kyotorphin was a linear noncompetitive inhibitor with ATP as the variable substrate and a linear competitive inhibitor with peptide as the variable substrate. ADP, a product of the kinase reaction, was a linear noncompetitive inhibitor with respect to ATP and a linear competitive inhibitor with respect to peptide. Based on these data, it can be suggested that the tyrosine protein kinase from A-431 cells catalyzes a Ordered Bi Bi reaction where peptide is the first substrate to bind and ADP is the last product to be released."
https://openalex.org/W2017073811,"Incubation of rat cerebral cortical slices with the beta-adrenergic agonist isoproterenol causes an increase in alpha 2-adrenergic receptor binding in addition to a decrease in beta-adrenergic receptor binding. The effects are rapid and reversible, show a parallel time course, and are blocked by sotalol, a beta-adrenergic receptor antagonist. The beta-mediated regulation of alpha 2-receptor sensitivity at brain norepinephrine synapses may be a mechanism for the homeostatic control of central noradrenergic activity."
https://openalex.org/W2057958136,"A bacteriophage T7 mutation, HS9, is phenotypically defective in gene 1.2, although it maps outside the gene. The single nucleotide change responsible for the HS9 mutation lies within the RNAase III recognition site immediately following gene 1.2. This RNAase III recognition site, responsible for the processing of the mRNA encoding genes 1.1 and 1.2, contains two cleavage sites, separated by 29 bases. The HS9 mutation prevents cutting by RNAase III at one site in vitro, yielding a mRNA containing an additional 29 bases at its 3' end. The ten second-site reversion mutations of HS9 are all located in the RNAase III recognition site and either restore or eliminate cutting at both sites. RNAase III mutants of Escherichia coli phenotypically suppress the HS9 mutation. We propose that the extra 29 bases at the 3' end of the mRNA hybridize to the ribosome-binding site of gene 1.1; gene 1.1 immediately precedes gene 1.2 on the same mRNA molecule. Such hybridization prevents the initiation of translation of this mRNA containing gene 1.1. A strong polar effect represses the translation of gene 1.2."
https://openalex.org/W2034299820,"A monoclonal antibody directed against cap-binding proteins was used to elucidate the possible mechanism by which cap-binding proteins function in initiation of eucaryotic translation. The monoclonal antibody preparation employed in this study exhibited a marked differential effect in inhibiting the translation of folded, capped eucaryotic-mRNAs to a far greater extent than naturally uncapped mRNAs or native capped mRNAs that do not possess extensive 5' end secondary structure. These findings were consistent with the effects of the antibody on initiation complex formation with three different types of reovirus mRNA: native reovirus mRNA; inosine-substituted reovirus mRNA, which has a relaxed secondary structure; and bromouridine-substituted reovirus mRNA, in which base pairing is enhanced relative to regular reovirus mRNA. The extent that translation initiation complex formation was inhibited by the monoclonal antibody directly correlated to the degree of secondary structure present in the mRNA. Binding of bromouridine-substituted reovirus mRNA to ribosomes was inhibited to the greatest extent, while binding of inosine-substituted reovirus mRNA was not inhibited at all in the reticulocyte lysate system or was slightly inhibited in a wheat-germ system. These results support the hypothesis that cap-binding proteins are involved in unwinding of the 5' terminal, secondary structure of many eucaryotic mRNAs, thus facilitating the attachment of ribosomes to mRNA."
https://openalex.org/W2091837785,"The neurotoxin 6-hydroxydopamine produced a permanent loss of endogenous norepinephrine and of 3H-labeled norepinephrine uptake sites in the hippocampus within 5 days. These losses were initially accompanied by parallel decreases in tyrosine hydroxylase activity and synaptosomal norepinephrine synthesis. Within 21 days, however, hippocampal tyrosine hydroxylase activity and norepinephrine synthesis rate increased three- to fivefold. These data suggest a novel form of plasticity in brain-damaged animals characterized by an increase in the capacity for transmitter biosynthesis in residual neurons."
https://openalex.org/W2046235055,"Infection of NIH/3T3 and Balb/c/3T3 fibroblastic cell lines by Abelson virus results in stable transformation in most cases. We have observed that certain rodent cell lines, including some Balb/c/3T3 sublines, do not maintain stable transformation following infection. Within three to four weeks of infection of these cell lines a large fraction of the cells is not recoverable upon serial passage and appear to be killed. The residual population of cells displays a flat, nontransformed phenotype. Concomitant with this reversion is the loss of the integrated provirus and loss of expression of the Abelson virus transforming protein. This loss of the integrated provirus is specific to transformation-competent viral strains. The effect of Abelson virus on these cells appears to be, in part, due to a lethal effect of the transforming protein on the cells. We have selectively isolated mutants of Abelson virus that stably transform these rodent cell lines without expressing a lethal effect. Analysis of the nucleic acid and protein structure of these mutant virus strains showed that the transforming proteins are shorter, having lost expression of the carboxy-terminal one third of the protein. We suspect that the carboxy-terminal portion of the wild-type Abelson protein may modulate the in vivo expression of the protein kinase activity and that this may cause the transforming protein to have a deleterious effect on certain cell lines."

Desmosine and isodesmosine, cross-linking compounds associated with mature elastin, were found in hydrolysates of the shell membrane, confirming the necessity for lysyl oxidase in its biosynthesis. Shell membranes from hens fed a copper-deficient diet or a diet supplemented with beta-aminopropionitrile had a reduced content of desmosine and isodesmosine."
https://openalex.org/W2131837878,"Polymerization of microtubular protein is promoted by GTP but not GDP. GDP is shown to inhibit both the rate and extent of GTP-induced microtubule assembly. The critical protein concentration for assembly was increased from 0.3 mg/ml with 200 JLM GTP to 0.8 mg/ ml with 200 JLM GTP and 600 JLM GDP. The relative binding constants for GDP and GTP to the tubulin exchangeable binding site (E-site) are used to quantitatively analyze the mechanism by which GDP raises the critical protein concentration and thereby reduces the extent of microtubule assembly. Evidence that guanine nucleotides also interact with microtubular protein at a previously unknown, low affinity binding site is supported by the following observations. 1. At a constant ratio of GDP/GTP, a greater degree of inhibition of the extent of microtubule assembly was observed at higher concentrations of total nucleotide. This result cannot be accounted for by binding at only the E-site. 2. Inhibition of microtubule assembly by a high concentration of GDP (3 mM) is not reversed by increasing the GTP concentration to 7 m. Based upon the dissociation constants for GDP and GTP at the E-site, tubulin would be largely saturated with GTP under these conditions and should polymerize in the absence of additional nucleotide interactions. 3. GTP specifically inhibits microtubule assembly at concentrations greater than 3 mM. Inhibition of assembly by high concentrations (7 m~) of ATP and CTP is shown to involve a different mechanism. 4. Microtubules are depolymerized by high concentrations of GTP (>5 mM) or GDP (>2 mM). The rate for this disassembly is greater than that observed during microtubule turnover following inhibition of polymerization, suggesting that high Concentrations of guanine nucleotides destabilize microtubules by interacting at a low affinity site."

https://openalex.org/W2050894831,"Fluorescence resonance energy transfer was used to follow the dynamic equilibrium of actin polymerization. We prepared fluorescent analogs of actin by labeling actin covalently with fluorescein (as the donor) and with eosin (as the acceptor). The copolymer of donor- and acceptor-labeled actin exhibits a 60%–70% efficiency of energy transfer. We followed the subunit exchange among filaments both by mixing the donor-acceptor copolymer with unlabeled F actin, and by mixing donor-labeled F actin with acceptor-labeled F actin. The extent of subunit exchange is dependent on ionic conditions. In addition, different kinetics are observed in the two approaches in the presence of excess magnesium ions. The effects of cytochalasin B as a model actin-binding factor were also investigated. One micromolar cytochalasin B reduces the rates of subunit exchange, monomer incorporation and filament depolymerization. At 10 μM cytochalasin B, we detected destabilization of filaments using a morphological assay. The results are discussed in relation to existing models of actin subunit exchange, and to proposed mechanisms of actin-cytochalasin interactions."
https://openalex.org/W2020809028,"We have examined the chromatin structure of a repeated cluster of tRNA genes of Xenopus laevis, with particular attention to possible phase relationships between nucleosomes and the underlying tDNA sequence. In transcriptionally active liver and cultured kidney cells, essentially all tDNA is packaged into regularly spaced nucleosomes, but no detectable phase relationship exists between nucleosomes and DNA sequence. Only in transcriptionally inactive erythrocytes do nucleosomes on all tDNA repeats occur in one predominant phase. In this phasing arrangement, nucleosomes are regularly spaced with the exception of a 250 base pair gap occurring once per 3.18 kilobase repeat unit. This arrangement suggests that nucleosome phasing may aid in the organization of a specific higher order packaging, with each unit of packaging containing one 3.18 kilobase repeat."

The enzyme gives a single band on polyacrylamide disc gel electrophoresis. The Mr of the enzyme is 145,000 and it has two subunits of Mr = 72,000. Amino acid analysis reveals major differences from other human cobalamin-binding proteins. Based on x-ray fluorescence, the enzyme has 2 mol of cobalamin bound/mol of enzyme. In contrast to purified cobalamin transport proteins, most of the cobalamin bound to the enzyme is not released by boiling at low pH in the presence of KCN, or dialysis against 7.5 M guanidine containing 0.2 M dithiothreitol, or both, suggesting the possibility that cobalamin may be covalently attached to the purified enzyme.

https://openalex.org/W1515436868,"We have studied factors affecting the catalytic activity of dihydroorotase (EC 3.5.2.3), purified as part of a multienzymatic protein which contains carbamyl phosphate synthetase, aspartate transcarbamylase, and dihydroorotase (ME pyr1-3) and which initiates de novo pyrimidine biosynthesis in mouse Ehrlich ascites carcinoma. The apparent Km value for N-carbamyl-L-aspartate increases by 2 orders of magnitude as the pH increases from 7.0 to 8.3, consistent with equilibration of dihydroorotase (E) between four states of protonation (E in equilibrium EH in equilibrium EH2 equilibrium EH3), where EH3 is the only catalytically active form of dihydroorotase for the biosynthetic reaction, having a Km for N-carbamyl-L-aspartate of 30 micro M. The apparent Km for L-dihydroorotate shows a converse dependence upon pH, remaining relatively constant at alkaline pH and increasing progressively as the pH is decreased below 7.0. These data are consistent with the above model if E and EH are catalytically active for the degradative reaction, both having Km values of 4.4 micro M for L-5,6-dihydroorotate. The D isomers of carbamylaspartate and dihydroorotate are also substrates for dihydroorotase. At pH 7.33, the apparent Km values for N-carbamyl-L-aspartate and N-carbamyl-D-aspartate are 247 and 204 micro M, respectively, but the Vmax for N-carbamyl-D-aspartate is only 1.7% of that obtained with N-carbamyl-L-aspartate. Orotate and a series of 5-substituted derivatives are competitive inhibitors of dihydroorotase. At pH 7.27, the apparent Ki for orotate using N-carbamyl-L-aspartate as substrate is 170 micro M and with L-5,6-dihydroorotate as substrate, the apparent Ki value is 9.6 micro M, suggesting that the enzyme exists in different forms in the presence of each substrate. Dihydroorotase is inhibited in a time-dependent manner by 50 mM L-cysteine and the presence of N-carbamyl-L-aspartate or L-5,6-dihydroorotate protects against this ultimately complete inactivation. 2-Mercaptoacetate, 2-mercaptoethylamine, 3-mercaptopropionate, and L-2,3-diaminopropionate have a similar although less potent inhibitory effect. To account for the data obtained, we propose a model for the equilibria existing between various protonated forms of dihydroorotase which is consistent with the pH dependencies of the apparent Km values observed and the Vmax values observed previously (Christopherson, R.I., and Jones, M.E. (1979) J. Biol. Chem. 254, 12506-12512). In addition, a catalytic mechanism is presented for the interconversion of N-carbamyl-L-aspartate and L-5,6-dihydroorotate."

The high molecular weight proteins were not present in soluble epidermal extracts in EDTA prior to cross-linking. The substrate was purified by DEAE-Sepharose CL-6B and ACA-34 gel filtration, where it demonstrated an apparent molecular weight of 36,000. In the presence of Ca2+ and transglutaminase, the purified protein was converted to high molecular weight polymers which, under conditions of high protein concentration, included a protein aggregate insoluble in urea, sodium dodecyl sulfate, or beta-mercaptoethanol. Cross-linking did not occur with Ca2+ alone or in the presence of EDTA or putrescine, a competitive inhibitor. The epsilon-(gamma-glutamyl) lysine isodipeptide was identified in high molecular weight products of cross-linking but not in the Mr = 36,000 precursor. We postulate the intracellular assembly of Mr = 36,000 substrate, with subsequent cross-linking by transglutaminase and insolubilization into the keratinocyte membrane."
https://openalex.org/W1504284044,"A new procedure for the photochemical labeling of peptides and for the production of cleavable cross-links between protein molecules is given. This method is mediated through the catalytic action of the enzyme guinea pig liver transglutaminase. Each of the labeling and cross-linking reagents described here is an amine substrate for transglutaminases and, because of the narrow specificity of these enzymes, is introduced covalently only at the gamma-carboxamide group of available peptide-bound glutamine residues. Cross-linking results either solely through the action of the enzyme in the case of a diamine substrate, or by subsequent photolysis in the case of photosensitive amine substrates. Cleavable bonds in several of the substrates are disulfide or vicinal hydroxyl groups. The validity of the procedure is demonstrated by the preparation of photosensitive derivatives of substance P and glucagon 1-6 and in the cleavable covalent cross-linking of guanidinated beta-casein."

https://openalex.org/W1486229800,"The chlorination of the flavoenzyme D-amino acid oxidase (EC 1.4.3.3, from hog kidney) by N-chloro-D-leucine, which specifically slows flavin reduction by a factor of 2 x 10(3), has been studied with respect to the site and mechanism of chlorination and the chlorinated enzyme has been extensively characterized. Our major results are as follows: 1. The oxidized holoenzyme (E0) incorporates 2 eq of 36Cl/flavin site from D-[N-36Cl]leucine. Evidence from amino acid and 36Cl analysis, isotopic dilution, and spectral titrations shows that the target residue is tyrosine and that this is converted to 3,5-dichlorotyrosine. The resulting decrease in basicity of this tyrosine (similar to 10(3)-fold) parallels the decrease (2 x 10(3)-fold) in the first order rate constant for flavin reduction observed with E0-Cl2 and we show that this residue satisfies all available criteria as being directly involved in the catalysis of flavin reduction. 2. Half-modified enzyme is a mixture of 0.5 E0 + 0.5 E0-Cl2 and E0-Cl is therefore chlorinated much more rapidly than E0 (kCl = 8 x 10(2) M-1S-1). Several lines of evidence show that enzyme-bound N-chloro-D-leucine is not oxidized prior to chlorination of the active site tyrosine. 3. The chlorination reaction is highly specific with respect to the structure of the chlorinating agent. Only the N-chloro derivatives of D-leucine, D-isoleucine, and D-norvaline are reactive while N-chloro derivatives of L-amino acids are tightly bound, but reversibly competitive, inhibitors which markedly perturb the electronic spectrum of enzyme-bound FAD."

Such toxicity was originally observed in Drosophila harboring a hereditary virus, sigma, and has been considered unique to Drosophila. The new findings support the possibility that insects with piercing and sucking mouthparts harbor similar hereditary viruses and transmit some of them to vertebrates or plants."

Carboxylation of this labeled propionyl-CoA by propionyl-CoA carboxylase from pig heart and acetyl-CoA carboxylase from the uropygial gland completely removed 3H. Repeated treatment of (R,S)-[methyl-14C]methylmalonyl-CoA with the decarboxylase converted 50% of the substrate into propionyl-CoA, whereas (S)-methylmalonyl-CoA, generated by both carboxylases, was completely decarboxylated. Radioactive (R)- (S), and (R,S)-methylmalonyl-CoA were equally incorporated into fatty acids by fatty acid synthetase from the uropygial gland. The residual methylmalonyl-CoA remaining after fatty acid synthetase reaction on (R,S)-methylmalonyl-CoA was also racemic. These results show that: (a) the decarboxylase is stereospecific, (b) replacement of the carboxyl group by hydrogen occurs with retention of configuration, (c) acetyl-CoA carboxylase of the uropygial gland generates (S)-methylmalonyl-CoA from propionyl-CoA, and (d) fatty acid synthetase is not stereospecific for methylmalonyl-CoA."

https://openalex.org/W1501315042,"Abstract Initial velocity and product inhibition studies were conducted with the glutamine-dependent reaction of asparagine synthetase from mouse pancreas. Double reciprocal plots of glutamine versus either aspartate or ATP were parallel, while aspartate versus ATP gave intersecting patterns. These patterns are indicative of a hybrid ping-pong mechanism consisting of a glutaminase partial reaction and a sequential catalysis involving aspartate and ATP. Inhibition patterns of the four products, glutamate, AMP, PPi, and asparagine, versus each of the three substrates are consistent with a hybrid Uni Uni Bi Ter Ping Pong Theorell-Chance mechanism where the glutaminase reaction occurs first and aspartate binds to the enzyme before ATP in the sequential segment. PPi is the first product released in the Theorell-Chance reaction, which is followed by the ordered release of AMP and asparagine. Product inhibition patterns also indicate the formation of E . NH3 . Asn and E . NH3 . Asp . AMP abortive complexes. Although an amide site (for glutamine and asparagine), presumably responsible for the glutaminase reaction, an acid site (for glutamate and aspartate), and a nucleotide site are involved in the overall catalysis, the two-site ping-pong mechanism is incompatible with the experimentally observed product inhibition patterns."

https://openalex.org/W1596077157,"A factor has been found in rat liver supernatant solution which inhibits acetyl-CoA carboxylase activity regardless of the presence or absence of Mg2+ and ATP. Inactivation of the enzyme has been demonstrated via radiochemical and spectrophotometric assay procedures. The inactivation of acetyl-CoA carboxylase is not attributable to either malonyl-CoA decarboxylase activity, to phosphorylation of the enzyme, or to action on substrates or cofactors of the reaction. The activity of the inhibitor is destroyed by heating to 70-80 degrees C for 5 min or by treatment with trypsin. Dialyzing the inhibitor for 24 h at 4 degrees C does not alter its activity in inhibiting acetyl-CoA carboxylase. Hence, it appears that the inhibitor is a regulatory protein that acts directly on acetyl-CoA carboxylase."
https://openalex.org/W1541062598,"The interaction of stearoyl-(1,N6)-etheno coenzyme A (stearoyl-epsilon-CoA) with acetyl coenzyme A carboxylase was investigated by using fluorescence spectroscopy. The fluorescence emission of stearoyl-epsilon-CoA was partially quenched by acetyl coenzyme A carboxylase. Analysis of the data for dissociation constant (KD) and the stoichiometry of the interaction (n) gave values of 5.06 nM and 1.2, respectively, at pH 7.6 in 50 mM Tris-HCl and 25 degrees C. The KD value is comparable to the inhibition constant (Ki) obtained previously by others for the inhibition of rat liver acetyl coenzyme A carboxylase by long chain fatty acyl-CoAs. Citrate (which is known to polymerize and thus activate carboxylase) caused a partial quenching of the protein fluorescence of carboxylase, presumably due to polymerization of the enzyme. The quenching of the stearoyl-epsilon-CoA fluorescence caused by carboxylase as well as the inhibition of carboxylase activity by stearoyl-epsilon-CoA was reversed by citrate, but only in the presence of 6-O-methylglucose polysaccharide which forms a stable complex with fatty acyl-CoA. This shows that the stearoyl-epsilon-CoA bound to the enzyme is displaced by citrate only in the presence of an acceptor of fatty acyl-CoA. These results support the reciprocal relationship of citrate and fatty acyl-CoA in the regulation of acetyl coenzyme A carboxylase."
