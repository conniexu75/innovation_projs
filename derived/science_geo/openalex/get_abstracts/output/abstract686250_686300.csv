https://openalex.org/W4200524915,"Loss of alveolar type 2 cells (AEC2s) and the ectopic appearance of basal cells in the alveoli characterize severe lung injuries such as idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). Here we demonstrate that human alveolar type 2 cells (hAEC2s), unlike murine AEC2s, transdifferentiate into basal cells in response to fibrotic signalling in the lung mesenchyme, in vitro and in vivo. Single-cell analysis of normal hAEC2s and mesenchymal cells in organoid co-cultures revealed the emergence of pathologic fibroblasts and basaloid cells previously described in IPF. Transforming growth factor-β1 and anti-bone morphogenic protein signalling in the organoids promoted transdifferentiation. Trajectory and histologic analyses of both hAEC2-derived organoids and IPF epithelium indicated that hAEC2s transdifferentiate into basal cells through alveolar-basal intermediates that accumulate in proximity to pathologic CTHRC1hi/TGFB1hi fibroblasts. Our study indicates that hAEC2 loss and expansion of alveolar metaplastic basal cells in severe human lung injuries are causally connected through an hAEC2-basal cell lineage trajectory driven by aberrant mesenchyme."
https://openalex.org/W4200474246,"Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T cells represent a major breakthrough in cancer therapy, wherein a patient’s own T cells are engineered to recognize a tumor antigen, resulting in activation of a local cytotoxic immune response. However, CAR-T cell therapies are currently limited to the treatment of B cell cancers and their effectiveness is hindered by resistance from antigen-negative tumor cells, immunosuppression in the tumor microenvironment, eventual exhaustion of T cell immunologic functions and frequent severe toxicities. To overcome these problems, we have developed a novel class of CAR-T cells engineered to express an enzyme that activates a systemically administered small-molecule prodrug in situ at a tumor site. We show that these synthetic enzyme-armed killer (SEAKER) cells exhibit enhanced anticancer activity with small-molecule prodrugs, both in vitro and in vivo in mouse tumor models. This modular platform enables combined targeting of cellular and small-molecule therapies to treat cancers and potentially a variety of other diseases. The synthetic enzyme-armed killer (SEAKER) approach equips chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T cells with the capacity to express enzymes that process anticancer prodrugs at tumor sites of action."
https://openalex.org/W4200239440,"The bacterial domain produces numerous types of sphingolipids with various physiological functions. In the human microbiome, commensal and pathogenic bacteria use these lipids to modulate the host inflammatory system. Despite their growing importance, their biosynthetic pathway remains undefined since several key eukaryotic ceramide synthesis enzymes have no bacterial homolog. Here we used genomic and biochemical approaches to identify six proteins comprising the complete pathway for bacterial ceramide synthesis. Bioinformatic analyses revealed the widespread potential for bacterial ceramide synthesis leading to our discovery of a Gram-positive species that produces ceramides. Biochemical evidence demonstrated that the bacterial pathway operates in a different order from that in eukaryotes. Furthermore, phylogenetic analyses support the hypothesis that the bacterial and eukaryotic ceramide pathways evolved independently."
https://openalex.org/W4205769173,"Toxicity of micro or nanoplastics (MP/NP) in aquatic life is well-documented, however, information about the consequences of exposure to these particles in terrestrial species is scarce. This study was used to evaluate the uptake and/or toxicity of polystyrene MP/NP in human gastric cells, comparing doses, particle sizes (50, 100, 200, 500, 1000 or 5000 nm) and surface functionalization (aminated, carboxylated or non-functionalized). In general, the uptake of 50 nm particles was significantly higher than 1000 nm particles. Among the 50 nm particles, the aminated particles were more avidly taken up by the cells and were cytotoxic at a lower concentration (≥ 7.5 μg/mL) compared to same sized carboxylated or non-functionalized particles (≥ 50 μg/mL). High toxicity of 50 nm aminated particles corresponded well with significantly high rates of apoptosis-necrosis induced by these particles in 4 h (29.2% of total cells) compared to all other particles (≤ 16.8%). The trend of apoptosis-necrosis induction by aminated particles in 4 h was 50 > 5000 > 1000 > 500 > 200 > 100 nm. The 50 nm carboxylated or non-functionalized particles also induced higher levels of apoptosis-necrosis in the cells compared to 100, 1000 and 5000 nm particles with same surface functionalization but longer exposure (24 h) to 50 nm carboxylated or non-functionalized particles significantly (p<0.0001) increased apoptosis-necrosis in the cells. The study demonstrated that the toxicity of MP/NP to gastric cells was dependent on particle size, dose surface functionalization and exposure period."
https://openalex.org/W4200094881,"Prior research has found that East Asians are less willing than Westerners to seek social support in times of need. What factors account for this cultural difference? Whereas previous research has examined the mediating effect of relational concern, we predicted that empathic concern, which refers to feeling sympathy and concern for people in need and varies by individuals from different cultures, would promote support seeking. We tested the prediction in two studies. In Study 1, European Canadians reported higher empathic concern and a higher frequency of support seeking, compared to the Japanese participants. As predicted, cultural differences in social support seeking were influenced by empathic concern. In Study 2, both empathic concern and relational concern mediated cultural differences in support seeking. Japanese with lower empathic concern but higher relational concern were more reluctant than European Americans to seek social support during stressful times. Finally, loneliness, which was more prevalent among the Japanese than among the European Americans, was partially explained by social support seeking."
https://openalex.org/W4200244157,"Vaccine rejection is a problem severely impacting the global society, especially considering the COVID-19 outbreak. The need to understand the psychological mechanisms underlying the active involvement of the pro-vaccine and anti-vaccine movements is therefore very important both from a theoretical and practical perspective. This paper investigates the group identities of people with positive and negative attitudes towards vaccination, and their attitudes toward general science. A targeted sample study of 192 pro-vaccine and 156 anti-vaccine group members showed that the group identity of pro-vaccine individuals is higher than of anti-vaccine individuals. and that both pro-vaccine and anti-vaccine individuals had a positive attitude toward science. Results are discussed in context of the heterogeneity of motivations causing vaccine rejection and the relation between active involvement in online discussion and group identity."
https://openalex.org/W4200262097,"The study investigated how a group of 27 Wuhan citizens employed metaphors to communicate about their lived experiences of the Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic through in-depth individual interviews. The analysis of metaphors reflected the different kinds of emotional states and psychological conditions of the research participants, focusing on their mental imagery of COVID-19, extreme emotional experiences, and symbolic behaviors under the pandemic. The results show that multiple metaphors were used to construe emotionally-complex, isolating experiences of the COVID-19 pandemic. Most metaphorical narratives were grounded in embodied sensorimotor experiences such as body parts, battling, hitting, weight, temperature, spatialization, motion, violence, light, and journeys. Embodied metaphors were manifested in both verbal expressions and nonlinguistic behaviors (e.g., patients' repetitive behaviors). These results suggest that the bodily experiences of the pandemic, the environment, and the psychological factors combine to shape people's metaphorical thinking processes."
https://openalex.org/W4200362906,"Medical images commonly exhibit multiple abnormalities. Predicting them requires multi-class classifiers whose training and desired reliable performance can be affected by a combination of factors, such as, dataset size, data source, distribution, and the loss function used to train deep neural networks. Currently, the cross-entropy loss remains the de-facto loss function for training deep learning classifiers. This loss function, however, asserts equal learning from all classes, leading to a bias toward the majority class. Although the choice of the loss function impacts model performance, to the best of our knowledge, we observed that no literature exists that performs a comprehensive analysis and selection of an appropriate loss function toward the classification task under study. In this work, we benchmark various state-of-the-art loss functions, critically analyze model performance, and propose improved loss functions for a multi-class classification task. We select a pediatric chest X-ray (CXR) dataset that includes images with no abnormality (normal), and those exhibiting manifestations consistent with bacterial and viral pneumonia. We construct prediction-level and model-level ensembles to improve classification performance. Our results show that compared to the individual models and the state-of-the-art literature, the weighted averaging of the predictions for top-3 and top-5 model-level ensembles delivered significantly superior classification performance (p < 0.05) in terms of MCC (0.9068, 95% confidence interval (0.8839, 0.9297)) metric. Finally, we performed localization studies to interpret model behavior and confirm that the individual models and ensembles learned task-specific features and highlighted disease-specific regions of interest.

https://openalex.org/W4200103480,"Cholestasis is a common condition in which the flow of bile from the liver to the intestines is inhibited. It has been shown that organic anion-transporting polypeptide 3A1 (OATP3A1) is upregulated in cholestasis to promote bile acid efflux transport. We have previously shown that the growth factor fibroblast growth factor 19 and inflammatory mediator tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα) increased OATP3A1 mRNA levels in hepatoma peritoneal lavage cell/PRF/5 cell lines. However, the mechanism underlying TNFα-stimulated OATP3A1 expression in cholestasis is unknown. To address this, we collected plasma samples from control and obstructive cholestasis patients and used ELISA to detect TNFα levels. We found that the TNFα levels of plasma and hepatic mRNA transcripts were significantly increased in obstructive cholestatic patients relative to control patients. A significant positive correlation was also observed between plasma TNFα and liver OATP3A1 mRNA transcripts in patients with obstructive cholestasis. Further mechanism analysis revealed that recombinant TNFα induced OATP3A1 expression and activated NF-κB and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) signaling pathways as well as expression of related transcription factors p65 and specificity protein 1 (SP1). Dual-luciferase reporter and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays showed that recombinant TNFα upregulated the binding activities of NF-κB p65 and SP1 to the OATP3A1 promoter in peritoneal lavage cell/PRF/5 cells. These effects were diminished following the application of NF-κB and ERK inhibitors BAY11-7082 and PD98059. We conclude that TNFα stimulates hepatic OATP3A1 expression in human obstructive cholestasis by activating NF-κB p65 and ERK-SP1 signaling. These results suggest that TNFα-activated NF-κB p65 and ERK-SP1 signaling may be a potential target to ameliorate cholestasis-associated liver injury."
https://openalex.org/W4206319123,"To reexamine the relationship between leisure-time physical activity (LTPA) and the built environment (BE), this paper takes advantage of the massive amount of data collected by an accelerometer and GPS-based fitness mobile app. Massive LTPA data from more than 3 million users were recorded by Codoon in 500m by 500m grid cells and aggregated to 742 natural cities in mainland China. Six BE indicators were quantified using GIS at the city scale. Robust regression analysis was used to estimate the correlation between LTPA and BE. Five of six BE indicators-connectivity, road density, land use mix, points of interest density, and density of parks and squares-were significantly, positively, independently, and linearly related to LTPA in the regression analysis. The study obtains findings that are consistent with the previous literature but also provides novel insights into the important role of POI density in encouraging LTPA, as well as how the relationship between LTPA and BE varies by time of day. The study also sheds light on the embrace of new technology and new data in public health and urban studies."
https://openalex.org/W4206932710,"Poverty is a key contributor to delayed diagnosis and limited access to early intervention and rehabilitation for children with cerebral palsy (CP) in rural Bangladesh. 97% of families of children with CP live below the poverty line in Bangladesh. Therefore, in low-and middle-income countries (LMICs), efforts to improve outcomes for children with CP (including health-related quality of life, motor function, communication, and nutritional attainments) should also include measures to improve family economic and social capital. We propose a randomised controlled trial (RCT) to evaluate the effectiveness of an integrated microfinance/livelihood and community-based rehabilitation (IMCBR) program for ultra-poor families of children with CP in rural Bangladesh.This will be a cluster RCT comparing three arms: (a) integrated microfinance/livelihood and community-based rehabilitation (IMCBR); (b) community-based rehabilitation (CBR) alone; and (c) care-as-usual (i.e. no intervention). Seven clusters will be recruited within each arm. Each cluster will consist of 10 child-caregiver dyads totalling 21 clusters with 210 dyads. Parents recruited in the IMCBR arm will take part in a microfinance/livelihood program and Parent Training Module (PTM), their children with CP will take part in a Goal Directed Training (GDT) program. The programs will be facilitated by specially trained Community Rehabilitation Officers. The CBR arm includes the same PTM and GDT interventions excluding the microfinance/livelihood program. The care-as-usual arm will be provided with information about early intervention and rehabilitation. The assessors will be blinded to group allocation. The duration of the intervention will be 12 months; outcomes will be measured at baseline, 6 months, 12 months, and 18 months.This will be the first RCT of an integrated microfinance/livelihood and CBR program for children with CP in LMIC settings. Evidence from the study could transform approaches to improving wellbeing of children with CP and their ultra-poor families."
https://openalex.org/W4200051793,"The monomorphic antigen-presenting molecule major histocompatibility complex-I-related protein 1 (MR1) presents small-molecule metabolites to mucosal-associated invariant T (MAIT) cells. The MR1-MAIT cell axis has been implicated in a variety of infectious and noncommunicable diseases, and recent studies have begun to develop an understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying this specialized antigen presentation pathway. However, proteins regulating MR1 folding, loading, stability, and surface expression remain to be identified. Here, we performed a gene trap screen to discover novel modulators of MR1 surface expression through insertional mutagenesis of an MR1-overexpressing clone derived from the near-haploid human cell line HAP1 (HAP1.MR1). The most significant positive regulators identified included β2-microglobulin, a known regulator of MR1 surface expression, and ATP13A1, a P5-type ATPase in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) not previously known to be associated with MR1-mediated antigen presentation. CRISPR/Cas9-mediated knockout of ATP13A1 in both HAP1.MR1 and THP-1 cell lines revealed a profound reduction in MR1 protein levels and a concomitant functional defect specific to MR1-mediated antigen presentation. Collectively, these data are consistent with the ER-resident ATP13A1 being a key posttranscriptional determinant of MR1 surface expression."
https://openalex.org/W4200056213,"Major advances in genome sequencing and large-scale biosynthetic gene cluster (BGC) analysis have prompted an age of natural product discovery driven by genome mining. Still, connecting molecules to their cognate BGCs is a substantial bottleneck for this approach. We have developed a mass-spectrometry-based parallel stable isotope labeling platform, termed IsoAnalyst, which assists in associating metabolite stable isotope labeling patterns with BGC structure prediction to connect natural products to their corresponding BGCs. Here we show that IsoAnalyst can quickly associate both known metabolites and unknown analytes with BGCs to elucidate the complex chemical phenotypes of these biosynthetic systems. We validate this approach for a range of compound classes, using both the type strain Saccharopolyspora erythraea and an environmentally isolated Micromonospora sp. We further demonstrate the utility of this tool with the discovery of lobosamide D, a new and structurally unique member of the family of lobosamide macrolactams."
https://openalex.org/W4200115480,"Gastric carcinoma (GC) is one of the most common cancer globally. Despite its worldwide decline in incidence and mortality over the past decades, gastric cancer still has a poor prognosis. However, the key regulators driving this process and their exact mechanisms have not been thoroughly studied. This study aimed to identify hub genes to improve the prognostic prediction of GC and construct a messenger RNA-microRNA-long non-coding RNA(mRNA-miRNA-lncRNA) regulatory network.The GSE66229 dataset, from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database, and The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database were used for the bioinformatic analysis. Differential gene expression analysis methods and Weighted Gene Co-expression Network Analysis (WGCNA) were used to identify a common set of differentially co-expressed genes in GC. The genes were validated using samples from TCGA database and further validation using the online tools GEPIA database and Kaplan-Meier(KM) plotter database. Gene set enrichment analysis(GSEA) was used to identify hub genes related to signaling pathways in GC. The RNAInter database and Cytoscape software were used to construct an mRNA-miRNA-lncRNA network.A total of 12 genes were identified as the common set of differentially co-expressed genes in GC. After verification of these genes, 3 hub genes, namely CTHRC1, FNDC1, and INHBA, were found to be upregulated in tumor and associated with poor GC patient survival. In addition, an mRNA-miRNA-lncRNA regulatory network was established, which included 12 lncRNAs, 5 miRNAs, and the 3 hub genes.In summary, the identification of these hub genes and the establishment of the mRNA-miRNA-lncRNA regulatory network provide new insights into the underlying mechanisms of gastric carcinogenesis. In addition, the identified hub genes, CTHRC1, FNDC1, and INHBA, may serve as novel prognostic biomarkers and therapeutic targets."

We matched two subjects without FM to each subject with FM by sex and age and geographic location. Baseline characteristics were evaluated by t-test for continuous variables and chi-square for categorical variables. Predictors of COVID-19 associated hospitalization were identified using univariable logistic regression model, significant variables were selected and analyzed by a multivariable logistic regression model.The initial cohort comprised 18,598 patients with FM and 36,985 matched controls. The mean age was 57.5± 14.5(SD), with a female dominance of 91%. Out of this cohort we extracted the study population, which included all patients contracted with COVID-19, and consisted of 571 patients with FM and 1008 controls. By multivariable analysis, the following variables were found to predict COVID-19 associated hospitalization in patients with FM: older age (OR, 1.25; CI, 1.13-1.39; p<0.001), male sex (OR, 2.63; CI, 1.18-5.88; p<0.05) and hypertension (OR, 1.75; CI, 1.04-2.95; p<0.05).The current population-based study revealed that FM per se was not directly associated with COVID-19 hospitalization or related mortality. Yet classical risk factors endangering the general population were also relevant among patients with FM."

Therefore, the aim of the study was to compare and quantify the perceptions of virtual reality use in soccer, and to model behavioural intentions to use this technology. This study surveyed the perceptions of coaches, support staff, and players in relation to their knowledge, expectations, influences and barriers of using virtual reality via an internet-based questionnaire. To model behavioural intention, modified questions and constructs from the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology were used, and the model was analysed through partial least squares structural equation modelling. Respondents represented coaches and support staff (n = 134) and players (n = 64). All respondents generally agreed that virtual reality should be used to improve tactical awareness and cognition, with its use primarily in performance analysis and rehabilitation settings. Generally, coaches and support staff agreed that monetary cost, coach buy-in and limited evidence base were barriers towards its use. In a sub-sample of coaches and support staff without access to virtual reality (n = 123), performance expectancy was the strongest construct in explaining behavioural intention to use virtual reality, followed by facilitating conditions (i.e., barriers) construct which had a negative association with behavioural intention. Virtual reality has the potential to be a valuable technology within professional soccer although several barriers exist that may prevent its widespread use."
https://openalex.org/W4200578685,"Uncontrolled gluconeogenesis results in elevated hepatic glucose production in type 2 diabetes (T2D). The small ubiquitin-related modifier (SUMO)-specific protease 2 (SENP2) is known to catalyze deSUMOylation of target proteins, with broad effects on cell growth, signal transduction, and developmental processes. However, the role of SENP2 in hepatic gluconeogenesis and the occurrence of T2D remain unknown. Herein, we established SENP2 hepatic knockout mice and found that SENP2 deficiency could protect against high-fat diet-induced hyperglycemia. Pyruvate- or glucagon-induced elevation in blood glucose was attenuated by disruption of SENP2 expression, whereas overexpression of SENP2 in the liver facilitated high-fat diet-induced hyperglycemia. Using an in vitro assay, we showed that SENP2 regulated hepatic glucose production. Mechanistically, the effects of SENP2 on gluconeogenesis were found to be mediated by the cellular fuel sensor kinase, 5'-AMP-activated protein kinase alpha (AMPKα), which is a negative regulator of gluconeogenesis. SENP2 interacted with and deSUMOylated AMPKα, thereby promoting its ubiquitination and reducing its protein stability. Inhibition of AMPKα kinase activity dramatically reversed impaired hepatic gluconeogenesis and reduced blood glucose levels in SENP2-deficient mice. Our study highlights the novel role of hepatic SENP2 in regulating gluconeogenesis and furthers our understanding of the pathogenesis of T2D."

Attenuation coefficient and up to 56 different image features were extracted from A-line and B-scan of 1703 EB-OCT images. Attenuation coefficient and 29 image features with significant p-values were used to analyze the differences between normal and malignant samples. A RF classifier was trained using 70% images as training set, while 30% images were included in the testing set. The accuracy of the automated classification was validated by clinically proven pathological results.Attenuation coefficient and 29 image features were found to present different properties with significant p-values between normal and malignant EB-OCT images. The RF algorithm successfully classified the malignant pulmonary nodules with sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of 90.41%, 77.87% and 83.51% respectively.It is clinically practical to distinguish the nature of pulmonary nodules by integrating EB-OCT imaging with automated machine learning algorithm. Diagnosis of malignant pulmonary nodules by analyzing quantitative features from EB-OCT images could be a potentially powerful way for early detection of lung cancer."
https://openalex.org/W4206757205,"Magnolol is a bioactive polyphenolic compound commonly found in Magnolia officinalis. The aim of this study is to clarify the contribution of the magnolol additive on the growth performance of Linwu ducklings aging from 7 to 28 d, comparing to the effects of antibiotic additive (colistin sulphate). A total of 325, 7-d-old ducklings were assigned to 5 groups. Each group had 5 cages with 13 ducklings in each cage. The ducklings in different groups were fed with diets supplemented with 0, 100, 200 and 300 mg/kg magnolol additive (MA) (Control, MA100, MA200 and MA300) and 30 mg/kg colistin sulphate (CS30) for 3 weeks, respectively. Parameters regarding to the growth performance, intestinal mucosal morphology, serum biochemical indices, antioxidant and peroxide biomarkers and the expression levels of antioxidant-related genes were evaluated by one way ANOVA analysis. The results showed that 30 mg/kg colistin sulphate, 200 and 300 mg/kg magnolol additive improved the average final weight (P = 0.045), average daily body weight gain (P = 0.038) and feed/gain ratios (P = 0.001) compared to the control group. 200 and 300 mg/kg magnolol additive significantly increased the villus height/crypt depth ratio of ileum, compared to the control and CS30 groups (P = 0.001). Increased serum level of glucose (P = 0.011) and total protein (P = 0.006) were found in MA200 or MA300 group. In addition, comparing to the control and CS30 groups, MA200 or MA300 significantly increased the levels of superoxide dismutase (P = 0.038), glutathione peroxidase (P = 0.048) and reduced glutathione (P = 0.039) in serum. Moreover, the serum and hepatic levels of 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine (P = 0.043 and 0.007, respectively) were lower in all MA groups compared to those of the control and CS30 group. The hepatic mRNA expression levels of superoxide dismutase-1, catalase and nuclear factor erythroid-2-related factor 2/erythroid-derived CNC-homology factor were also increased significantly in MA200 and MA300 groups (P < 0.05). Taken together, these data demonstrated that MA was an effective feed additive enhancing the growth performance of Linwu ducklings at 7 to 28 d by improving the antioxidant and intestinal mucosal status. It suggested that MA could be a potential ingredient to replace the colistin sulphate in diets."
https://openalex.org/W4200043429,"Adherence to antiretroviral therapy (ART) remains problematic. Regular monitoring of its barriers is clinically recommended, however, patient-provider communication around adherence is often inadequate. Our team thus decided to develop a new electronically administered patient-reported outcome measure (PROM) of barriers to ART adherence (the I-Score) to systematically capture this data for physician consideration in routine HIV care. To prepare for a controlled definitive trial to test the I-Score intervention, a pilot study was designed. Its primary objectives are to evaluate patient and physician perceptions of the I-Score intervention and its implementation strategy.This one-arm, 6-month study will adopt a mixed method type 3 implementation-effectiveness hybrid design and be conducted at the Chronic Viral Illness Service of the McGill University Health Centre (Montreal, Canada). Four HIV physicians and 32 of their HIV patients with known or suspected adherence problems will participate. The intervention will involve having patients complete the I-Score through a smartphone application (Opal), before meeting with their physician. Both patients and physicians will have access to the I-Score results, for consideration during the clinic visits at Times 1, 2 (3 months), and 3 (6 months). The implementation strategy will focus on stakeholder involvement, education, and training; promoting the intervention's adaptability; and hiring an Application Manager to facilitate implementation. Implementation, patient, and service outcomes will be collected (Times 1-2-3). The primary outcome is the intervention's acceptability to patients and physicians. Qualitative data obtained, in part, through physician focus groups (Times 2-3) and patient interviews (Times 2-3) will help evaluate the implementation strategy and inform any methodological adaptations.This study will help plan a definitive trial to test the efficacy of the I-Score intervention. It will generate needed data on electronic PROM interventions in routine HIV care that will help improve understanding of conditions for their successful implementation.ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT04702412; https://clinicaltrials.gov/."
https://openalex.org/W4200355559,"Alkylation of DNA and RNA is a potentially toxic lesion that can result in mutations and even cell death. In response to alkylation damage, K63-linked polyubiquitin chains are assembled that localize the Alpha-ketoglutarate-dependent dioxygenase alkB homolog 3-Activating Signal Cointegrator 1 Complex Subunit (ASCC) repair complex to damage sites in the nucleus. The protein ASCC2, a subunit of the ASCC complex, selectively binds K63-linked polyubiquitin chains via its coupling of ubiquitin conjugation to ER degradation (CUE) domain. The basis for polyubiquitin-binding specificity was unclear, because CUE domains in other proteins typically bind a single ubiquitin and do not discriminate among different polyubiquitin linkage types. We report here that the ASCC2 CUE domain selectively binds K63-linked diubiquitin by contacting both the distal and proximal ubiquitin. The ASCC2 CUE domain binds the distal ubiquitin in a manner similar to that reported for other CUE domains bound to a single ubiquitin, whereas the contacts with the proximal ubiquitin are unique to ASCC2. Residues in the N-terminal portion of the ASCC2 α1 helix contribute to the binding interaction with the proximal ubiquitin of K63-linked diubiquitin. Mutation of residues within the N-terminal portion of the ASCC2 α1 helix decreases ASCC2 recruitment in response to DNA alkylation, supporting the functional significance of these interactions during the alkylation damage response. Our study reveals the versatility of CUE domains in ubiquitin recognition."
https://openalex.org/W4200316318,"HPV16 is the most prominent cause of cervical cancer. HPV16 E1, a helicase required for HPV replication exhibits increased expression in association with cervical cancer progression, suggesting that E1 has a similar effect on the host as the HPV16 E6 and E7 oncoproteins. This study aimed to determine whether expression of HPV16 E1 correlated with carcinogenesis by modulating cellular pathways involved in cervical cancer. HEK293T cells were transfected with pEGFP, pEGFPE1 or truncated forms of HPV16 E1. Cell proliferation, cell death, and the impact of HPV16 E1 on host gene expression was then evaluated. HPV16 E1 overexpression resulted in a significant reduction of cell viability and cellular proliferation (p-value<0.0001). Moreover, prolonged expression of HPV16 E1 significantly induced both apoptotic and necrotic cell death, which was partially inhibited by QVD-OPH, a broad-spectrum caspase inhibitor. Microarray, real time RT-PCR and kinetic host gene expression analyses revealed that HPV16 E1 overexpression resulted in the downregulation of genes involved in protein synthesis (RPL36A), metabolism (ALDOC), cellular proliferation (CREB5, HIF1A, JMJDIC, FOXO3, NFKB1, PIK3CA, TSC22D3), DNA damage (ATR, BRCA1 and CHEK1) and immune response (ISG20) pathways. How these genetic changes contribute to HPV16 E1-mediated cervical carcinogenesis warrants further studies."
https://openalex.org/W4205119347,"A conventional model of public opinion analysis is no longer suitable when the internet is the primary arena of information dissemination. Thus, a more practical approach is urgently needed to deal with this dynamic and complicated phenomenon of propagating public opinion. This paper proposes that the outbreak of internet public opinion and its negative impacts, such as the occurrence of major security incidents, are a result of coupling and the complex interaction of many factors. The Functional Resonance Analysis Method model is composed of those factors and considers the stages of network information dissemination, the unique propagation rule, and textual sentiment resonance on the internet. Moreover, it is the first public opinion governance method that simultaneously highlights the complex system, functional identification, and functional resonance. It suggests a more effective method to shorten the dissipation time of negative public opinion and is a considerable improvement over previous models for risk-prediction. Based on resonance theory and deep learning, this study establishes public opinion resonance functions, which made it possible to analyze public opinion triggers and build a simulation model to explore the patterns of public opinion development through long-term data capture. The simulation results of the Functional Resonance Analysis Method suggest that the resonance in the model is consistent with the evolution of public opinion in real situations and that the components of the resonance of public opinion can be separated into eleven subjective factors and three objective factors. In addition, managing the subjective factors can significantly accelerate the dissipation of negative opinions."

Despite the continuous effort from the public and private sectors at various levels, its use among youth remains low. Therefore, this study aimed to assess the factors associated with condom use during the last sexual intercourse among male college youth.We conducted a cross-sectional study and analyzed the responses of 361 male college youth (aged 19 to 24 years who reported being sexually active preceding six months of the survey), among the 903 participants who reported being involved in vaginal and anal sexual intercourse. The chi-square test was primarily used to find the associated factors and then, stepwise logistic regression was performed by selecting the covariates after the multicollinearity test followed by adjustment of confounders.We found that more than one-fourth (27.4%) of the sexually active male youth had used the condoms during their last sexual intercourse. Postgraduate male youth were four times more likely to use the condoms during the last sexual intercourse than undergraduate male youth (AOR = 4.09, 95% CI; 2.08-8.06). Similarly, married youth were less likely to use the condoms during the last sexual intercourse with 95% lower odds than their counterparts (AOR = 0.05, 95% CI; 0.01-0.38). Male youth with adequate knowledge about the condoms were 8 times more likely to use them compared to those with inadequate knowledge (AOR = 8.42, 95% CI; 4.34-16.33). Likewise, male youth with favorable attitude towards the condoms were 2.5 times more likely to use them compared to their counterparts (AOR = 2.58, 95% CI; 1.23-5.42). Similarly, male youth having two or more sex partners were 4.5 times more likely to use the condoms than the youth having only a sex partner (AOR = 4.57, 95% CI; 2.38-8.76).The study concluded that slightly more than one-fourth (27.4%) of male college youth in Kaski district used the condoms during their last sexual intercourse. Level of education, marital status, knowledge about condoms, attitude toward condoms, and number of sex partners are the determinants of condom use among male college youth so recommended for early behavioral interventions, especially in knowledge and attitude. Further studies focusing on including the rural youth and larger geography may help to reach a firmer conclusion."
https://openalex.org/W4200253227,"Under adverse weather conditions, visibility and the available pavement friction are reduced. The improper selection of speed on curved road sections leads to an unreasonable distribution of longitudinal and lateral friction, which is likely to cause rear-end collisions and lateral instability accidents. This study considers the combined braking and turning maneuvers to obtain the permitted vehicle speed under rainy conditions. First, a braking distance computation model was established by simplifying the relationship curve between brake pedal force, vehicle braking deceleration, and braking time. Different from the visibility commonly used in the meteorological field, this paper defines ""driver’s sight distance based on real road scenarios"" as a threshold to measure the longitudinal safety of the vehicle. Furthermore, the lateral friction and rollover margin is defined to characterize the vehicle’s lateral stability. The corresponding relationship between rainfall intensity-water film thickness-road friction is established to better predict the safe speed based on the information issued by the weather station. It should be noted that since the road friction factor of the wet pavement not only determined the safe vehicle speed but also be determined by the vehicle speed, so we adopt Ferrari’s method to solve the quartic equation about permitted vehicle speed. Finally, the braking and turning maneuvers are considered comprehensively based on the principle of friction ellipse. The results of the TruckSim simulation show that for a single-unit truck, running at the computed permitted speed, both lateral and longitudinal stability meet the requirements. The proposed permitted vehicle speed model on horizontal curves can provide driving guidance for drivers on curves under rainy weather or as a decision-making basis for road managers."
https://openalex.org/W4200379206,"More than 70% of patients admitted to emergency departments (EDs) in Denmark are older patients with multimorbidity and polypharmacy vulnerable to adverse events and poor outcomes. Research suggests that patient involvement and shared decision-making (SDM) could optimize the treatment of older patients with polypharmacy. The patients become more aware of potential outcomes and, therefore, often tend to choose less medication. However, implementing SDM in clinical practice is challenging if it does not fit into existing workflows and healthcare systems.The aim was to explore the determinants of patient involvement in decisions made in the ED about the patient's medication.The design was a qualitative ethnographic study. We observed forty-eight multidisciplinary healthcare professionals in two medical EDs focusing on medication processes and patient involvement in medication. Based on field notes, we developed a semi-structured interview guide. We conducted 20 semi-structured interviews with healthcare professionals to elaborate on the findings. Data were analyzed with thematic analyses.We found five themes (determinants) which affected patient involvement in decisions about medicine in the ED: 1) blurred roles among multidisciplinary healthcare professionals, 2) older patients with polypharmacy increase complexity, 3) time pressure, 4) faulty IT- systems, and 5) the medicine list as a missed enabler of patient involvement.There are several barriers to patient involvement in decisions about medicine in the ED and some facilitators. A tailored medication conversation guide based on the SDM methodology combined with the patient's printed medicine list and well-functioning IT- systems can function as a boundary object, ensuring the treatment is optimized and aligned with the patient's preferences and goals."
https://openalex.org/W4205348393,"Systems epidemiology offers a more comprehensive and holistic approach to studies of cancer in populations by considering high dimensionality measures from multiple domains, assessing the inter-relationships among risk factors, and considering changes over time. These approaches offer a framework to account for the complexity of cancer and contribute to a broader understanding of the disease. Therefore, NCI sponsored a workshop in February 2019 to facilitate discussion about the opportunities and challenges of the application of systems epidemiology approaches for cancer research. Eight key themes emerged from the discussion: transdisciplinary collaboration and a problem-based approach; methods and modeling considerations; interpretation, validation, and evaluation of models; data needs and opportunities; sharing of data and models; enhanced training practices; dissemination of systems models; and building a systems epidemiology community. This manuscript summarizes these themes, highlights opportunities for cancer systems epidemiology research, outlines ways to foster this research area, and introduces a collection of papers, ""Cancer System Epidemiology Insights and Future Opportunities"" that highlight findings based on systems epidemiology approaches."

In the absence of neonatal eye screening programmes in developing countries, the early identification of childhood cataract remains a major challenge. The primary aim of this study was to identify potential barriers to accessing childhood cataract services from the perspective of parents and carers, as a critical step towards increasing the timely uptake of cataract surgery. In-depth interviews were conducted using a pre-designed topic guide developed for this study to seek the views of parents and carers in nine geographic locations across eight states in India regarding their perceived barriers and enablers to accessing childhood cataract services. A total of 35 in-depth interviews were conducted including 30 at the hospital premises and 5 in the participants’ homes. All interviews were conducted in the local language and audio taped for further transcription and analysis. Data were organised using NVivo 11 and a thematic analysis was conducted utilising the Theoretical Domains Framework (TDF), an integrative framework of behavioural theories. The themes identified from interviews related to 11 out of 12 TDF domains. TDF domains associated with barriers included: ‘Environmental context and resources’, ‘Beliefs about consequences’ and ‘Social influences’. Reported enablers were identified in three theoretical domains: ‘Social influences’, ‘Beliefs about consequences’ and ‘Motivations and goals’. This comprehensive TDF approach enabled us to understand parents’ perceived barriers and enablers to accessing childhood cataract services, which could be targeted in future interventions to improve timely uptake."
https://openalex.org/W3046957040,"To what extent can the strength of a local urban community impact neighborhood safety? We construct measures of community vibrancy based on a unique dataset of block party permit approvals from the City of Philadelphia. Our first measure captures the overall volume of block party events in a neighborhood whereas our second measure captures differences in the type (regular versus spontaneous) of block party activities. We use both regression modeling and propensity score matching to control for the economic, demographic and land use characteristics of the surrounding neighborhood when examining the relationship between crime and our two measures of community vibrancy. We conduct our analysis on aggregate levels of crime and community vibrancy from 2006 to 2015 as well as the trends in community vibrancy and crime over this time period. We find that neighborhoods with a higher number of block parties have a significantly higher crime rate, while those holding a greater proportion of spontaneous block party events have a significantly lower crime rate. We also find that neighborhoods which have an increase in the proportion of spontaneous block parties over time are significantly more likely to have a decreasing trend in total crime incidence over that same time period."
https://openalex.org/W4200006755,"Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) continues to be a serious threat to the swine industry worldwide. Exostosin glycosyltransferase 1 (EXT1), an enzyme involved in the biosynthesis of heparin sulfate, has also been reported to be a host factor essential for a wide variety of pathogens. However, the role of EXT1 in PRRSV infection remains uncharted. Here, we identified that PRRSV infection caused an increase of EXT1 expression. EXT1 knockdown promoted virus infection, whereas its overexpression inhibited virus infection, suggesting an inhibitory function of EXT1 to PRRSV infection. We found that EXT1 had no effects on the attachment, internalization, or release of PRRSV but did restrict viral RNA replication. EXT1 was determined to interact with viral nonstructural protein 3 (nsp3) and nsp5 via its N-terminal cytoplasmic tail and to enhance K48-linked polyubiquitination of these two nsps to promote their degradation. Furthermore, the C-terminal glycosyltransferase activity domain of EXT1 was necessary for nsp3 and nsp5 degradation. We also found that EXT2, a EXT1 homolog, interacted with EXT1 and inhibited PRRSV infection. Similarly, EXT1 effectively restricted porcine epidemic diarrhea virus and porcine enteric alphacoronavirus infection in Vero cells. Taken together, this study reveals that EXT1 may serve as a broad-spectrum host restriction factor and suggests a molecular basis for the potential development of therapeutics against PRRSV infection."

The number of laid eggs and hatching rate of Yun7Ge are reduced, which is not conducive to reproduction. In this work, the target gene controlling giant egg trait is located on the Z chromosome and was determined through genetic analysis. Transcriptome results showed that phytanoyl-CoA dioxygenase domain-containing protein 1 (PHYHD1) on the Z chromosome was silenced, and the 25 chorion genes on chromosome 2 were remarkably downregulated. Sequence analysis showed that the 73.5 kb sequence including the PHYHD1 was replaced by a ~3.0 kb sequence. After knocking out the PHYHD1 by using CRISPR/Cas9, the chorion genes were significantly downregulated. Hence, the silencing of PHYHD1 leads to the downregulation of many chorion protein genes, thus directly causing giant eggs."
https://openalex.org/W4200102416,"In order to investigate the effect of pre-loading damage on the structural performance of Carbon Fiber Reinforced Polymer (CFRP) strengthened Reinforced Concrete (R.C.) beams, experimental and Finite Element Modelling (FEM) investigation was carried out on six R.C. beams. Five of the R.C. beams were damaged up to different levels of strain in the main steel bars before Flexure CFRP strengthening. One of the R.C. beams loaded up to failure and was kept as a control beam for comparison. The experimental results showed that the failure mode of the CFRP strengthened specimen was controlled by CFRP debonding followed by concrete crushing; however, the control beam failed in concrete crushing after yielding the steel bars, which is a ductile failure. The CFRP sheet increases the strength and initial stiffness of the R.C. beams and reduces ductility and toughness. Also, CFRP application increases the first crack and yielding steel bars load by 87.4% and 34.4%, respectively. Furthermore, the pre-damage level does not influence the strength and ductility of the strengthened R.C. beams except for the highest damage levels, which experienced a slight decrease in load capacity and ductility. However, the initial stiffness decreases with increasing pre-damage levels by 40%. Design guideline ACI 440.2R (2004) predicts the ultimate load capacity marvelously for externally bonded Fiber-Reinforced Polymer (FRP) beams compared to the experimental maximum load capacity. The excellent agreement between experimental and FEM results indicates that the constitutive models used for concrete and reinforcement and the cohesive interface model can well capture fracture behavior. However, The FEM analysis predicts the beam to be slightly stiffer and more robust, probably because of the assumed perfect bond between concrete and reinforcement. The developed FEM can be used for further parametric study."
https://openalex.org/W4200149383,"Introduction The COVID-19 pandemic has affected the health systems in many ways. It has put unprecedented strain on health systems worldwide and exposed gaps in public health infrastructure. A health system comprises all institutions and resources working towards improving and maintaining health. Among the different aspects of health system strengthening, a patient’s experiences and expectations play a crucial role in determining how well the health facilities function. This study aims to explore health system strengthening’s implications based on experiences and feedback provided by COVID-19 patients admitted to a government tropical and infectious disease hospital in Nepal. Methods In this qualitative study, we collected the voluntary handwritten feedback by the admitted COVID-19 patients to document the feedback and experiences from a book, maintained by the hospital. We performed thematic content analysis using the World Health Organization’s six building blocks of health system as a theoretical framework which included service delivery, health workforce, information, leadership and governance, financing, and access to medicines. Results Most patients in this study had positive experiences on service delivery and health workforce. Some also highlighted the gaps in infrastructure, cleanliness, and hygiene. Many suggested positive experiences on other dimensions of the health system such as financing, governance and leadership, and access to medicines reflected upon by the patients’ thankfulness to the hospital and the government for the treatment they received. The responses also reflected the inter-connectedness between the different building blocks of health system. Conclusion This study approached a unique way to strengthen the health system by exploring patients’ feedback, which suggested an overall positive impression on most building blocks of health system. However, it also highlighted certain gaps in infrastructure, cleanliness, and hygiene. It reinforces the hospital management and government’s role to continue its efforts to strengthen the health system."
https://openalex.org/W4200259838,"Tuberculosis and Human Immunodeficiency Virus are among the top ten causes of death globally. To prevent the spread of these infections, health workers and student nurses should comply to infection prevention and control measures called standard precautions. The aim of this study is to assess compliance of Eswatini university student nurses regarding standard precautions for preventing Tuberculosis and Human Immunodeficiency Virus. A non-experimental quantitative approach was used to conduct a survey on all senior student nurses of Eswatini University using questionnaires. IBM SPSS Statistics version 26 software was used to analyse the data. Results from this study showed that out of the 105 student nurses who were asked only 51.4% (n = 54) said they always used personal protective equipment. However, they did comply well on disposing sharps as 92.4% (n = 97) reported that they always used designated containers. There is a need for close supervision of student nurses in the clinical area. The researcher recommends that clinical facilitator should always accompany student nurses in the clinical area and that preceptors should be exempted from other nursing duties when there are student nurses in the hospitals so that they can mentor the students."
https://openalex.org/W4200260636,"Complex diseases such as cancer and diabetes are underpinned by changes in metabolism, specifically by which and how nutrients are catabolized. Substrate utilization can be directly examined by measuring a metabolic endpoint rather than an intermediate (such as a metabolite in the tricarboxylic acid cycle). For instance, oxidation of specific substrates can be measured in vitro by incubation of live cultures with substrates containing radiolabeled carbon and measuring radiolabeled carbon dioxide. To increase throughput, we previously developed a miniaturized platform to measure substrate oxidation of both adherent and suspension cells using multiwell plates rather than flasks. This enabled multiple conditions to be examined simultaneously, ideal for drug screens and mechanistic studies. However, like many metabolic assays, this was not compatible with bicarbonate-buffered media, which is susceptible to alkalinization upon exposure to gas containing little carbon dioxide such as air. While other buffers such as HEPES can overcome this problem, bicarbonate has additional biological roles as a metabolic substrate and in modulating hormone signaling. Here, we create a bicarbonate-buffered well-plate platform to measure substrate oxidation. This was achieved by introducing a sealed environment within each well that was equilibrated with carbon dioxide, enabling bicarbonate buffering. As proof of principle, we assessed metabolic flux in cultured adipocytes, demonstrating that bicarbonate-buffered medium increased lipogenesis, glucose oxidation, and sensitivity to insulin in comparison to HEPES-buffered medium. This convenient and high-throughput method facilitates the study and screening of metabolic activity under more physiological conditions to aid biomedical research."
https://openalex.org/W4200400031,"Geometrical fencing is a scientific approach to fencing pioneered by Camillo Agrippa in the XVIth century which consists of characterizing the geometrical structure of fencing movements. Many geometrical spaces are involved in a duel, which evolve over time according to the skills of the fencers and the game rules. In this article, the concept of motion scheme is introduced as a flexible geometrical structure to represent fencing spaces evolving over time. The method is applied to the video of a duel of the Olympic games 2016. Five main results are presented. First, decisive actions of the duel are deduced from the distance between fencers. Second, footwork is reconstructed from horizontal movements of the feet. Third, a kinematic model is developed and compared with data in the literature. Fourth, the lunge attack is characterized and compared with data in the literature. Fifth, the role of the free hand is studied in the case of protective and balancing gestures. These findings provide rich information on the geometrical structure of fencing movements as well as on the tactical-strategic choices made by the fencers in real competition conditions. Finally, four applications illustrate the scientific value of motion schemes in fencing and other sports."

However, such studies were limited to hospital or community level without explaining the combined effects of weather and moon phases. We investigated whether changes in weather and moon phases affected emergency department (ED) visits due to fall injuries (FIs) based on nationwide emergency patient registry data.Nationwide daily data of ED visits after FI were collected from 11 provinces (7 metropolitan cities and 4 rural provinces) in Korea between January 2014 and December 2018. The daily number of FIs was standardized into FI per million population (FPP) in each province. A multivariate regression analysis was conducted to elucidate the relationship between weather factors and moon phases with respect to daily FPP in each province. The correlation between weather factors and FI severity was also analyzed.The study analyzed 666,912 patients (418,135 in metropolitan and 248,777 in rural areas) who visited EDs on weekdays. No regional difference was found in age or gender distribution between the two areas. Precipitation, minimum temperature and wind speed showed a significant association with FI in metropolitan areas. In addition, sunshine duration was also substantial risk factors for FI in rural areas. The incidence of FIs was increased on full moon days than on other days in rural areas. Injury severity was associated with weather factors such as minimum temperature, wind speed, and cloud cover.Weather changes such as precipitation, minimum temperature, and wind speed are associated with FI in metropolitan and rural areas. In addition, sunshine duration and full moon are significantly associated with FI incidence only in rural areas. Weather factors are associated with FI severity."

This will seriously affect the production and a fault diagnosis system is needed to reduce this effect. However, the existing popular fault diagnosis systems and methods need to be improved due to the limitations of rapier weaving machine process and electrical characteristics. Based on this, this paper presents an in-depth study of rapier loom fault diagnosis system and proposes a rapier loom fault diagnosis method combining edge expert system and cloud-based rough set and Bayesian network. By analyzing the process and fault characteristics of rapier loom, the electrical faults of rapier loom are classified into common faults and other faults according to the frequency of occurrence. An expert system is built in the field for edge computing based on knowledge fault diagnosis experience to diagnose common loom faults and reduce the computing pressure in the cloud. Collect loom fault data in the cloud, train loom fault diagnosis algorithms to diagnose other faults, and handle other faults diagnosed by the expert system. The effectiveness of loom fault diagnosis is verified by on-site operation and remote monitoring of the loom human-machine interaction system.

These are incorporated in the Log Gaussian Cox Process to estimate the impact of these risks on that in care homes.For an increase in the risk at the community level, the number of COVID-19 related deaths in the associated care home would be increased by exp (0.833), 2. This is based on a simulated dataset. In the context of COVID-19 related deaths, this study has illustrated the estimation of the risk to care homes in the presence of background community risk. This approach will be useful in facilitating the identification of the most vulnerable care homes and in predicting risk to new care homes.The modeling of two latent processes have been shown to be successfully facilitated by the use of the BYM and Log Gaussian Cox Process Models.

Lymphatics elsewhere in the body show increased contractility upon exposure to the prostaglandin F2alpha analog isoprostane-8-epi-prostaglandin. We investigated the ability of ophthalmic prostaglandin F2alpha analogs to increase CSF outflow when applied to the nasal mucosa by inhalation.Latanoprost (0.1, 0.5, or 1mg/ml), bimatoprost (0.3 or 3mg/ml), travoprost (0.04 or 0.4mg/ml), latanoprostene bunod (0.24 or 2.4mg/ml), tafluprost (0.25 or 2.5mg/ml), or control vehicle (10% DMSO) was administered to awake adult C57B/6 mice by nasal inhalation of 2μl droplets. Multiday dosing (daily for 3 days) of latanoprost also was evaluated. A total of 81 animals were studied including controls. General anesthesia was induced by injection, and fluorescent tracer (AlexaFluor647-labelled ovalbumin) was injected under stereotaxic guidance into the right lateral ventricle. Nasal turbinate tissue was harvested and homogenized after 1 hour for tracer detection by ELISA and fluorometric analysis.Inhalation of latanoprost 0.5mg/ml and 1mg/ml led to a 11.5-fold increase in tracer recovery from nasal turbinate tissues compared to controls (3312 pg/ml vs 288 pg/ml, p<0.001 for 0.5mg/ml; 3355 pg/ml vs 288 pg/ml, p<0.001 for 1mg/ml), while latanoprost 0.1 mg/ml enhanced recovery 6-fold (1713 pg/ml vs 288 pg/ml, p<0.01). Tafluprost 0.25mg/ml and bimatoprost 0.3mg/ml showed a modest (1.4x, p<0.05) effect, and the remaining agents showed no significant effect on tracer recovery. After 3 days of daily latanoprost treatment and several hours after the last dose, a persistently increased recovery of tracer was found.Prostaglandin F2alpha analogs delivered by nasal inhalation resulted in increased nasal recovery of a CSF fluorescent tracer, implying increased CSF outflow via the nasal lymphatics. The greatest effect, partially dose-dependent, was observed using latanoprost. Further studies are needed to determine the efficacy of these agents in reducing ICP in short and long-term applications."
https://openalex.org/W4226148557,"Relaxin/insulin-like family peptide receptor 1 (RXFP1) mediates relaxin's antifibrotic effects and has reduced expression in the lung and skin of patients with fibrotic interstitial lung disease (fILD) including idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) and systemic sclerosis (SSc). This may explain the failure of relaxin-based anti-fibrotic treatments in SSc, but the regulatory mechanisms controlling RXFP1 expression remain largely unknown. This study aimed to identify regulatory elements of RXFP1 that may function differentially in fibrotic fibroblasts. We identified and evaluated a distal regulatory region of RXFP1 in lung fibroblasts using a luciferase reporter system. Using serial deletions, an enhancer upregulating pGL3-promoter activity was localized to the distal region between -584 to -242bp from the distal transcription start site (TSS). This enhancer exhibited reduced activity in IPF and SSc lung fibroblasts. Bioinformatic analysis identified two clusters of activator protein 1 (AP-1) transcription factor binding sites within the enhancer. Site-directed mutagenesis of the binding sites confirmed that only one cluster reduced activity (-358 to -353 relative to distal TSS). Co-expression of FOS in lung fibroblasts further increased enhancer activity. In vitro complex formation with a labeled probe spanning the functional AP-1 site using nuclear proteins isolated from lung fibroblasts confirmed a specific DNA/protein complex formation. Application of antibodies against JUN and FOS resulted in the complex alteration, while antibodies to JUNB and FOSL1 did not. Analysis of AP-1 binding in 5 pairs of control and IPF lung fibroblasts detected positive binding more frequently in control fibroblasts. Expression of JUN and FOS was reduced and correlated positively with RXFP1 expression in IPF lungs. In conclusion, we identified a distal enhancer of RXFP1 with differential activity in fibrotic lung fibroblasts involving AP-1 transcription factors. Our study provides insight into RXFP1 downregulation in fILD and may support efforts to reevaluate relaxin-based therapeutics alongside upregulation of RXFP1 transcription."

https://openalex.org/W4200120508,"Disinvestment is the removal or reduction of previously provided practices or services, and has typically been undertaken where a practice or service has been clearly shown to be ineffective, inefficient and/or harmful. However, practices and services that have uncertain evidence of effectiveness, efficiency and safety can also be considered as candidates for disinvestment. Disinvestment from these practices and services is risky as they may yet prove to be beneficial if further evidence becomes available. A novel research approach has previously been described for this situation, allowing disinvestment to take place while simultaneously generating evidence previously missing from consideration. In this paper, we describe how this approach can be expanded to situations where three or more conditions are of relevance, and describe the protocol for a trial examining the reduction and elimination of use of mobilisation alarms on hospital wards to prevent patient falls. Our approach utilises a 3-group, concurrent, non-inferiority, stepped wedge, randomised design with an embedded parallel, cluster randomised design. Eighteen hospital wards with high rates of alarm use (≥3%) will be paired within their health service and randomly allocated to a calendar month when they will transition to a ""Reduced"" (<3%) or ""Eliminated"" (0%) mobilisation alarm condition. Dynamic randomisation will be used to determine which ward in each pair will be allocated to either the reduced or eliminated condition to promote equivalence between wards for the embedded parallel, cluster randomised component of the design. A project governance committee will set non-inferiority margins. The primary outcome will be rates of falls. Secondary clinical, process, safety, and economic outcomes will be collected and a concurrent economic evaluation undertaken."

An increasing number of hospital professionals use instant-messaging applications such as WhatsApp in their daily work. Previous research has mainly focused on the advantages and risks of WhatsApp usage in different clinical settings, but limited evidence is available about whether and how individual and organizational determinants can influence the use of WhatsApp in hospitals. Moreover, instruments to explore this phenomenon are lacking. A theoretical four-factor model based on the 'Technology Acceptance Model' and the Institutional Theory, guided the development of a new measure of the individual and institutional determinants of WhatsApp usage in hospitals.To develop and psychometrically test the questionnaire 'Digital Innovation Adoption in Hospitals'.A panel of researchers and clinical experts generated an initial pool of 35 items by identifying and adapting items from existing measures. These items were assessed for content and face validity by fourteen experts. The final 28-item 'Digital Innovation Adoption in Hospitals' questionnaire comprising four sections (Perceived risks, Perceived usefulness, Regulative factors and Normative factors) was administered online to nurses and physicians. Construct validity was tested through confirmatory factor analysis.The sample included 326 hospital nurses and physicians. The theoretical four-factors model was confirmed and the confirmatory factor analysis yielded acceptable fit indexes. The correlations between the factors were significant and ranged from -0.284 to 0.543 (p < .01). Reliability in terms of internal consistency was satisfactory with Cronbach's alpha coefficient ranging from 0.918-0.973.This study is the first to provide a validated tool to evaluate the use of WhatsApp in hospitals. The new instrument shows reasonable psychometric properties and is a promising and widely applicable measure of factors that influence the use of WhatsApp in hospitals."

Although addressed in a few longitudinal studies, the clinical course of Tourette's syndrome has not been quantitatively assessed. We had previously developed a method for quantifying the angular movements of neck tics using a compact gyroscope. Here, we present a follow-up study aimed at elucidating the clinical course of neck tics at both the group and individual levels.Eleven patients with Tourette's syndrome from our previous study participated in the present study, and their neck tics were recorded during a 5-min observation period. The severity of neck symptoms was assessed using the Yale Global Tic Severity Scale. The peak angular velocities and accelerations, tic counts, and severity scores in our previous study (baseline) and the present study (2-year follow-up) were compared at the group and individual levels. The individual level consistency between baseline and follow-up were calculated using intra-class correlation coefficients (ICCs, one-way random, single measure).At the group level, no significant change was observed between baseline and follow-up. At the individual level, angular velocity (ICC 0.73) and YGTSS scores (ICC 0.75) had substantial consistency over the two time points, and angular acceleration (ICC 0.59) and tic counts (ICC 0.69) had moderate consistency.The intensity and frequency of neck tics did not change over time. Therefore, quantification of angular neck motor tics will aid in identifying patients with neck tics at high risk for severe neck complications."

The aim of this study was to examine the justifications of those pursuing the formalization of a foregut subspecialty and to extract lessons for healthcare leaders on the evolving relationships between competing providers. This was a qualitative, cross-sectional study consisting of interviews, secondary survey data, and observation of society meetings between October 2018 and June 2019. Thirty interviews with healthcare professionals were conducted, transcribed, and analyzed for themes using qualitative coding software. Themes were correlated with observational field notes and archival data and compared against established social theories on professions and medical specialization. Analysis revealed that traditionally competing surgeons and gastroenterologists articulate a professional need to qualify foregut surgical expertise based on superior knowledge and outcomes, to define the allocation of certain tasks and procedures, and to foster collaboration across specialties. Converging market conditions precipitate individual and organizational decisions to pursue formal specialization. Participants in the formalization of this subspecialty should consider the history of professional competition and turf wars to achieve meaningful collaboration. Advocacy for multi-specialty societies and organizational movements could be a model for reduced conflict in other specialties as well."

We identified 554 eligible patients who were >65 years old and had been treated based on international recommendations at our center between June 2005 and June 2015. Patients with the luminal A subtype had the highest rates of overall survival (90.6%) and recurrence-free survival (97.0%), while the lowest overall survival rate was observed in those with the triple-negative subtype (81.3%) and the lowest recurrence-free survival rate was observed in those with the luminal B subtype (84.0%). Multivariate Cox proportional hazard analysis, using the luminal A subtype as the reference, revealed significant differences in recurrence-free survival among luminal B patients according to lymph node status. Among elderly Taiwanese women with breast cancer, the breast cancer subtype might help predict survival outcomes. The luminal B subtype was associated with poor recurrence-free survival, and lymph node status was useful for predicting recurrence-free survival in this subset of patients."

The main purpose of this study is to analyze coal caving law of flexible shield support and then to establish the internal relations among coal caving parameters under complex boundary conditions. Firstly, the law of coal caving in different falling modes is simulated physically. Secondly, the coal caving shape, displacement field, and contact force field is simulated. Then, coal caving law and process parameters is analyzed theoretically. Finally, the test was performed in Bai-Ji Mine. The research shows that ellipsoidal ore drawing theory has universal applicability in coal drawing law analysis and parameter optimization. After the Isolated Extraction Zone and Isolated Movement Zone reach the roof, the expansion speed is marked by a short delay, and then, while expanding to the floor, two butted incomplete ellipsoids are formed. There is a time-space difference in coal caving after the support, and some coal will be mined in the next round of coal caving. There are obvious differences in the coal loosening range, displacement field, and contact force field on both sides of the long axis. When the support falls along with the bottom plate, it is more conducive to the release of coal. The test shows that the research is of great significance for optimizing the caving parameters of flexible shield support in the pseudo-inclined working face of the steep seam."

This study was conducted to determine the prevalence of severe maternal morbidity (SMM) and the associated factors. Methods A hospital-based cross-sectional study was conducted at Koshi Hospital, Nepal, from January to March 2020. All women who met the inclusion criteria of age ≥18 years of age, Morang residents of Nepalese nationality, had received routine antenatal care, and given birth at Koshi Hospital were recruited consecutively. The World Health Organization criteria were used to identify the women with SMM. A multiple logistic regression analysis was performed. Overall, 346 women were recruited. Findings The prevalence of SMM was 6.6%. Among the SMM cases, the most frequently occurring SMM conditions were hypertensive disorders (12, 56.5%), hemorrhagic disorders (6, 26.1%), and severe management indicators (8, 34.8%). Women with no or primary education (adjusted odds ratio: 0.10, 95% confidence interval: 0.01, 0.76) decreased the odds of SMM compared to secondary education. Conclusion The approximately 7% prevalence of SMM correlated with global studies. Maternal education was significantly associated with SMM. If referral hospitals were aware of the expected prevalence of potentially life-threatening maternal conditions, they could plan to avert future reproductive complications."

Previous studies in human and non-human primate infants showed that adjuvants influenced the quality of plasma antibody responses induced by pediatric HIV envelope vaccine regimens. We recently reported that use of the 3M052-SE adjuvant and longer intervals between vaccinations are associated with higher magnitude of antibody responses in infant rhesus macaques. However, the impact of different adjuvants in HIV vaccine regimens on the developing infant B cell receptor (BCR) repertoire has not been studied. This study evaluated whether pediatric HIV envelope vaccine regimens with different adjuvants induced distinct antigen-specific memory B cell repertoires and whether specific immunoglobulin (Ig) immunogenetic characteristics are associated with higher magnitude of plasma antibody responses in vaccinated infant rhesus macaques. We utilized archived preclinical pediatric HIV vaccine studies PBMCs and tissue samples from 19 infant rhesus macaques immunized either with (i) HIV Env protein with a squalene adjuvant, (ii) MVA-HIV and Env protein co-administered using a 3-week interval, (iii) MVA-HIV prime/ protein boost with an extended 6-week interval between immunizations, or (iv) with HIV Env administered with 3M-052-SE adjuvant. Frequencies of vaccine-elicited HIV Env-specific memory B cells from PBMCs and tissues were similar across vaccination groups (frequency range of 0.06-1.72%). There was no association between vaccine-elicited antigen-specific memory B cell frequencies and plasma antibody titer or avidity. Moreover, the epitope specificity and Ig immunogenetic features of vaccine-elicited monoclonal antibodies did not differ between the different vaccine regimens. These data suggest that pediatric HIV envelope vaccine candidates with different adjuvants that previously induced higher magnitude and quality of plasma antibody responses in infant rhesus macaques were not driven by distinct antigen-specific memory BCR repertoires."
