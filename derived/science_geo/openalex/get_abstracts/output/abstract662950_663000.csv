https://openalex.org/W3104596207,"Abstract The reconstruction of bacterial and archaeal genomes from shotgun metagenomes has enabled insights into the ecology and evolution of environmental and host-associated microbiomes. Here we applied this approach to &gt;10,000 metagenomes collected from diverse habitats covering all of Earth’s continents and oceans, including metagenomes from human and animal hosts, engineered environments, and natural and agricultural soils, to capture extant microbial, metabolic and functional potential. This comprehensive catalog includes 52,515 metagenome-assembled genomes representing 12,556 novel candidate species-level operational taxonomic units spanning 135 phyla. The catalog expands the known phylogenetic diversity of bacteria and archaea by 44% and is broadly available for streamlined comparative analyses, interactive exploration, metabolic modeling and bulk download. We demonstrate the utility of this collection for understanding secondary-metabolite biosynthetic potential and for resolving thousands of new host linkages to uncultivated viruses. This resource underscores the value of genome-centric approaches for revealing genomic properties of uncultivated microorganisms that affect ecosystem processes."
https://openalex.org/W3099584446,"We developed a metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) test using cell-free DNA from body fluids to identify pathogens. The performance of mNGS testing of 182 body fluids from 160 patients with acute illness was evaluated using two sequencing platforms in comparison to microbiological testing using culture, 16S bacterial PCR and/or 28S–internal transcribed ribosomal gene spacer (28S–ITS) fungal PCR. Test sensitivity and specificity of detection were 79 and 91% for bacteria and 91 and 89% for fungi, respectively, by Illumina sequencing; and 75 and 81% for bacteria and 91 and 100% for fungi, respectively, by nanopore sequencing. In a case series of 12 patients with culture/PCR-negative body fluids but for whom an infectious diagnosis was ultimately established, seven (58%) were mNGS positive. Real-time computational analysis enabled pathogen identification by nanopore sequencing in a median 50-min sequencing and 6-h sample-to-answer time. Rapid mNGS testing is a promising tool for diagnosis of unknown infections from body fluids. A universal method enables high-specificity, unbiased pathogen detection from diverse body fluids using metagenomic sequencing and may accelerate clinical decisions."
https://openalex.org/W3101430868,"Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is characterized by the accumulation of the tau protein in neurons, neurodegeneration and memory loss. However, the role of non-neuronal cells in this chain of events remains unclear. In the present study, we found accumulation of tau in hilar astrocytes of the dentate gyrus of individuals with AD. In mice, the overexpression of 3R tau specifically in hilar astrocytes of the dentate gyrus altered mitochondrial dynamics and function. In turn, these changes led to a reduction of adult neurogenesis, parvalbumin-expressing neurons, inhibitory synapses and hilar gamma oscillations, which were accompanied by impaired spatial memory performances. Together, these results indicate that the loss of tau homeostasis in hilar astrocytes of the dentate gyrus is sufficient to induce AD-like symptoms, through the impairment of the neuronal network. These results are important for our understanding of disease mechanisms and underline the crucial role of astrocytes in hippocampal function. Alzheimer’s disease is often considered a disease of neurons. This study reveals that astrocytes are also impaired by the disease and that these cells contribute more to memory deterioration than previously thought."

https://openalex.org/W3104731129,"The 22q11.2 deletion syndrome (22q11DS) is associated with a 20-25% risk of schizophrenia. In a cohort of 962 individuals with 22q11DS, we examined the shared genetic basis between schizophrenia and schizophrenia-related early trajectory phenotypes: sub-threshold symptoms of psychosis, low baseline intellectual functioning and cognitive decline. We studied the association of these phenotypes with two polygenic scores, derived for schizophrenia and intelligence, and evaluated their use for individual risk prediction in 22q11DS. Polygenic scores were not only associated with schizophrenia and baseline intelligence quotient (IQ), respectively, but schizophrenia polygenic score was also significantly associated with cognitive (verbal IQ) decline and nominally associated with sub-threshold psychosis. Furthermore, in comparing the tail-end deciles of the schizophrenia and IQ polygenic score distributions, 33% versus 9% of individuals with 22q11DS had schizophrenia, and 63% versus 24% of individuals had intellectual disability. Collectively, these data show a shared genetic basis for schizophrenia and schizophrenia-related phenotypes and also highlight the future potential of polygenic scores for risk stratification among individuals with highly, but incompletely, penetrant genetic variants."
https://openalex.org/W3099074835,"We engineered a machine learning approach, MSHub, to enable auto-deconvolution of gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC–MS) data. We then designed workflows to enable the community to store, process, share, annotate, compare and perform molecular networking of GC–MS data within the Global Natural Product Social (GNPS) Molecular Networking analysis platform. MSHub/GNPS performs auto-deconvolution of compound fragmentation patterns via unsupervised non-negative matrix factorization and quantifies the reproducibility of fragmentation patterns across samples. A machine learning workflow enables auto-deconvolution of gas chromatography–mass spectrometry data."
https://openalex.org/W3103849663,"Neural activity exhibits complex dynamics related to various brain functions, internal states and behaviors. Understanding how neural dynamics explain specific measured behaviors requires dissociating behaviorally relevant and irrelevant dynamics, which is not achieved with current neural dynamic models as they are learned without considering behavior. We develop preferential subspace identification (PSID), which is an algorithm that models neural activity while dissociating and prioritizing its behaviorally relevant dynamics. Modeling data in two monkeys performing three-dimensional reach and grasp tasks, PSID revealed that the behaviorally relevant dynamics are significantly lower-dimensional than otherwise implied. Moreover, PSID discovered distinct rotational dynamics that were more predictive of behavior. Furthermore, PSID more accurately learned behaviorally relevant dynamics for each joint and recording channel. Finally, modeling data in two monkeys performing saccades demonstrated the generalization of PSID across behaviors, brain regions and neural signal types. PSID provides a general new tool to reveal behaviorally relevant neural dynamics that can otherwise go unnoticed."
https://openalex.org/W3105185855,"The genetic elements required to tune gene expression are partitioned in active and repressive nuclear condensates. Chromatin compartments include transcriptional clusters whose dynamic establishment and functioning depend on multivalent interactions occurring among transcription factors, cofactors and basal transcriptional machinery. However, how chromatin players contribute to the assembly of transcriptional condensates is poorly understood. By interrogating the effect of KMT2D (also known as MLL4) haploinsufficiency in Kabuki syndrome, we found that mixed lineage leukemia 4 (MLL4) contributes to the assembly of transcriptional condensates through liquid-liquid phase separation. MLL4 loss of function impaired Polycomb-dependent chromatin compartmentalization, altering the nuclear architecture. By releasing the nuclear mechanical stress through inhibition of the mechanosensor ATR, we re-established the mechanosignaling of mesenchymal stem cells and their commitment towards chondrocytes both in vitro and in vivo. This study supports the notion that, in Kabuki syndrome, the haploinsufficiency of MLL4 causes an altered functional partitioning of chromatin, which determines the architecture and mechanical properties of the nucleus."
https://openalex.org/W3104234426,"The brain generates negative prediction error (NPE) signals to trigger extinction, a type of inhibitory learning that is responsible for suppressing learned behaviors when they are no longer useful. Neurons encoding NPE have been reported in multiple brain regions. Here, we use an optogenetic approach to demonstrate that GABAergic cerebello-olivary neurons can generate a powerful NPE signal, capable of causing extinction of conditioned motor responses on its own. Learning to suppress maladaptive behaviors is critical for good mental health. Kim et al. show that mice can be taught to suppress previously acquired motor responses by selective and properly timed stimulation of the cerebello-olivary pathway."
https://openalex.org/W3105451747,"This study investigated whether the inclusion of a stimbiotic (STB) can improve performance, influence intestinal microbiota and fermentation activity, and reduce pro-inflammatory cytokines in piglets fed a low zinc oxide diet without antimicrobial growth promotors compared to fructo-oligosaccharide (FOS) and mannan-oligosaccharide (MOS) when housed either in good sanitary (GS) or poor sanitary (PS) environments. One hundred forty-four male pigs (28-day-old) were sorted by initial body weight (BW) and allocated to one of six experimental treatments: 1) GS environment without any additive (GS-CTR); 2) GS environment with 0.01% stimbiotic (GS-STB); 3) PS environment (without cleaning and disinfection of a previously populated room) without any additive (PS-CTR); 4) PS environment with 0.01% STB (PS-STB); 5) PS environment with 0.1% MOS (PS-MOS); and 6) PS environment with 0.2% FOS (PS-FOS). Each treatment had six replicates, with four animals each. Three feeding phases, based on corn, wheat, and soybean meal were available ad libitum for the 42-days of the study. Housing piglets under PS conditions negatively influenced performance, increased plasma tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), affected the fecal microbial populations and increased concentrations of branched-chain fatty acids (BCFA) compared to GS. Stimbiotic improved 42-d-BW under PS conditions ( P &lt; 0.05) whereas MOS or FOS had no effect. On d35, plasma TNF-α was reduced with STB in PS ( P &lt; 0.05). The ratio between VFA:BCFA increased ( P &lt; 0.05) with STB, MOS or FOS in PS, and under GS condition, STB also increased the ratio. Stimbiotic increased the proportion of Clostridiales Family XIII Incertae Sedis and Clostridiaceae , while MOS and FOS increased Selenomonadaceae , Catabacteriaceae and Fibrobacteraceae . These results indicate that STB shifted the intestinal microbiome to favor fiber fermentation which likely contributed to reduced inflammatory response and improved performance, particularly in piglets reared in PS conditions."

https://openalex.org/W3098843449,"Introduction Patient satisfaction is widely used to measure quality of healthcare by identifying potential areas for improvement. Aim of study is to assess patient satisfaction towards pharmacy services and its associated factors using newly developed questionnaire among outpatients attending public health clinics. Materials and methods Public Health Clinic Patient Satisfaction Questionnaire (PHC-PSQ) towards pharmacy services was developed using exploratory factor analysis and Cronbach’s α. A cross-sectional study was conducted among 400 patients visiting the pharmacy in three randomly selected public health clinics recruited via systematic random sampling. Data was collected using a set of questionnaire including PHC-PSQ. Factors associated with patient satisfaction was analysed using multiple linear regression. Results Final PHC-PSQ consisted of three domains (administrative competency, technical competency and convenience of location) and 22 items with 69.9% total variance explained. Cronbach's α for total items was 0.96. Total mean score for patient satisfaction was 7.56 (SD 1.32). Older age and higher education were associated with lower patient satisfaction mean score. Patients who had visited the pharmacy more than once in the past three months, perceived to be in better health status and had a more correct general knowledge of pharmacists expressed higher patient satisfaction mean score. Conclusions PHC-PSQ is a newly developedtool to measure patient satisfaction towards pharmacy services in public health clinics in Malaysia. Patient satisfaction was relatively high. Age, education, frequency of visit, self-perceived health status and general knowledge of pharmacists were factors significantly associated with patient satisfaction."
https://openalex.org/W3099919708,"Whole chromosome instability (W-CIN) is a hallmark of human cancer and contributes to the evolvement of aneuploidy. W-CIN can be induced by abnormally increased microtubule plus end assembly rates during mitosis leading to the generation of lagging chromosomes during anaphase as a major form of mitotic errors in human cancer cells. Here, we show that loss of the tumor suppressor genes TP53 and TP73 can trigger increased mitotic microtubule assembly rates, lagging chromosomes, and W-CIN. CDKN1A, encoding for the CDK inhibitor p21CIP1, represents a critical target gene of p53/p73. Loss of p21CIP1 unleashes CDK1 activity which causes W-CIN in otherwise chromosomally stable cancer cells. Consequently, induction of CDK1 is sufficient to induce abnormal microtubule assembly rates and W-CIN. Vice versa, partial inhibition of CDK1 activity in chromosomally unstable cancer cells corrects abnormal microtubule behavior and suppresses W-CIN. Thus, our study shows that the p53/p73 - p21CIP1 tumor suppressor axis, whose loss is associated with W-CIN in human cancer, safeguards against chromosome missegregation and aneuploidy by preventing abnormally increased CDK1 activity."
https://openalex.org/W3105197834,"Marine protected areas (MPAs) are valuable tools for marine conservation that aim to limit human impacts on marine systems and protect valuable species or habitats. However, as species distributions shift due to ocean warming, acidification, and oxygen depletion from climate change, the areas originally designated under MPAs may bear little resemblance to their past state. Different approaches have been suggested for coping with species on the move in conservation. Here, we test the effectiveness of different MPA designs, including dynamic, network, and different directional orientations on protecting shifting species under climate change through ecosystem modeling in a theoretical ecosystem. Our findings suggest that dynamic MPAs may benefit some species (e.g., whiting and anchovy) and fishing fleets, and these benefits can inform the design or adaptation of MPAs worldwide. In addition, we find that it is important to design MPAs with specific goals and to account for the effects of released fishing pressure and species interactions in MPA design."
https://openalex.org/W3102333537,"The Kenya Demographic and Health Survey (KDHS 2014) revealed changing patterns in the contraceptive use of young women aged 15–24, shifting from injectable methods to implants. Long-acting reversible contraception (LARC) is user friendly, long-term, and more effective than other modern methods. It could be a game-changer in dealing with unintended pregnancies and herald a new chapter in the reproductive health and rights of young women. This study determined the factors associated with LARC use among adolescent girls and young women to expand the evidence of its potential as the most effective method of reducing unwanted pregnancies among the cohort. This study analysed secondary data from KDHS 2014 using binary logistic regression. The findings showed a rise in LARC use (18%), with identified predictors of reduced odds being aged 15–19 [OR = 0.735, 95% CI = 0.549–0.984], residence (rural) [OR = 0.674, CI = 0.525–0.865], religion (Protestant/other Christian) [OR = 0.377, CI = 0.168–0.842], married, [OR = 0.746, CI = 0.592–0.940], and region (high contraception) [OR = 0.773, CI = 0.626–0.955], while the number of living children showed increased odds for 1–2 children [OR = 17.624, CI = 9.482–32.756] and 3+ children [OR = 23.531, CI = 11.751–47.119]. This study established the rising popularity of LARC and identified factors that can be addressed to promote it. Its increased uptake could help Kenya achieve the International Conference on Population and Development 25’s first and second commitments on teenage pregnancies and maternal and new-born health, thus promoting the health, wellbeing, educational goals, and rights of this critical cohort. This study can guide the accelerated efforts needed in Kenya’s march towards the five zeros of unmet need for contraception, teenage pregnancies, unsafe abortions, preventable maternal deaths, and preventable neonatal/infant deaths."
https://openalex.org/W3101038251,"The SARS-CoV-2 virion responsible for the current world-wide pandemic COVID-19 has a characteristic Spike protein (S) on its surface that embellishes both a prefusion state and fusion state. The prefusion Spike protein (S) is a large trimeric protein where each protomer may be in a so-called Up state or Down state, depending on the configuration of its receptor binding domain (RBD) within its distal, prefusion S1 domain. The Up state is believed to allow binding of the virion to ACE-2 receptors on human epithelial cells, whereas the Down state is believed to be relatively inactive or reduced in its binding behavior. We have performed detailed all-atom, dominant energy landscape mappings for noncovalent interactions (charge, partial charge, and van der Waals) of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein in its static prefusion state based on two recent and independent experimental structure publications. We included both interchain interactions and intrachain (domain) interactions in our mappings in order to determine any telling differences (different so-called “glue” points) between residues in the Up and Down state protomers. The S2 proximal, fusion domain demonstrated no appreciable energetic differences between Up and Down protomers, including interchain as well as each protomer’s intrachain, S1-S2 interactions. However, the S1 domain interactions across neighboring protomers, which include the RBD-NTD cross chain interactions, showed significant energetic differences between Up-Down and Down-Down neighboring protomers. This included, for example, a key RBD residue ARG357 in the Up-Down interaction and a three residue sequence ALA520-PRO521-ALA522, associated with a turn structure in the RBD of the Up state protomer, acting as a stabilizing interaction with the NTD of its neighbor protomer. Additionally, our intra chain dominant energy mappings within each protomer, identified a significant “glue” point or possible “latch” for the Down state protomer between the S1 subdomain, SD1, and the RBD domain of the same protomer that was completely missing in the Up state protomer analysis. Ironically, this dominant energetic interaction in the Down state protomer involved the backbone atoms of the same three residue sequence ALA520-PRO521-ALA522 of the RBD with the amino acid R-group of GLN564 in the SD1 domain. Thus, this same three residue sequence acts as a stabilizer of the RBD in the Up conformation through its interactions with its neighboring NTD chain and a kind of latch in the Down state conformation through its interactions with its own SD1 domain. The dominant interaction energy residues identified here are also conserved across reported variations of SARS-CoV-2, as well as the closely related virions SARS-Cov and the bat corona virus RatG13. We conducted preliminary molecular dynamics simulations across 0.1 μ seconds to see if this latch provided structural stability and indeed found that a single point mutation (Q564G) resulted in the latch releasing transforming the protomer from the Down to the Up state conformation. Full trimeric Spike protein studies of the same mutation across all protomers, however, did not exhibit latch release demonstrating the critical importance of interchain interactions across the S1 domain, including RBD-NTD neighboring chain interactions. Therapies aimed at disrupting these noncovalent interactions could be a viable route for the physico-chemical mitigation of this deadly virion."
https://openalex.org/W3101883674,"The use of nanomaterials in agriculture is a current need and could be helpful in overcoming food security risks. Brassica napus L. is the third most important crop for edible oil, having double low unsaturated fatty acids. In the present study, we investigated the effects of green synthesized Zn NPs on biochemical effects, antioxidant enzymes, nutritional quality parameters and on the fatty acid profile of rapeseed ( B . napus ). Plant-mediated synthesis of zinc nanoparticles (Zn NPs) was carried out using Mentha arvensis L. leaf extract followed by characterization through ultraviolet–visible spectroscopy (UV-vis), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), energy dispersive X-Ray (EDX), and X-Ray diffraction (XRD). NPs exhibited irregular shapes ranging in size from 30–70 nm and EDX analysis confirmed 96.08% of Zn in the sample. The investigated biochemical characterization (protein content, proline content, total soluble sugar (TSS), total flavonoid content (TFC), and total phenolic content (TPC) showed a substantial change on exposure to Zn NPs. A dose-dependent gradual increase was observed in the antioxidant enzymes, superoxide dismutase (SOD), peroxidase (POD), and catalase (CAT). Oil and moisture contents dropped significantly from the control level in the rapeseed ( B . napus ) varieties. However, different trends in nutritional (Zn, Na+, K+) and fatty acid profiling of B . napus have been noted. This study demonstrates that Zn NPs have the potential to improve the biochemical, nutritional, antioxidant enzymes, and fatty acid profile of B . napus varieties."
https://openalex.org/W3098834999,"Today, many science communicators are using social media to share scientific information with citizens, but, as research has shown, fostering conversational exchanges remains a challenge. This largely qualitative study investigated the communication strategies applied by individual scientists and environmental non-governmental organizations on Twitter and Instagram to determine whether particular social media practices encourage two-way conversations between science communicators and citizens. Data from Twitter and Instagram posts, interviews with the communicators, and a survey of audience members were triangulated to identify emergent communication strategies and the resulting engagement; provide insight into why particular practices are employed by communicators; and explain why audiences choose to participate in social media conversations with communicators. The results demonstrate that the application of interpersonal communication strategies encourage conversational engagement, in terms of the number of comments and unique individuals involved in conversations. In particular, using selfies (images and videos), non-scientific content, first person pronoun-rich captions, and responding to comments result in the formation of communicator-audience relationships, encouraging two-way conversations on social media. Furthermore, the results indicate that Instagram more readily supports the implementation of interpersonal communication strategies than Twitter, making Instagram the preferred platform for promoting conversational exchanges. These findings can be applicable to diverse communicators, subjects, audiences, and environments (online and offline) in initiatives to promote awareness and understanding of science."

https://openalex.org/W3100593981,"Public health scholarship has increasingly called for the use of system science approaches to understand complex problems, including the use of participatory engagement to inform the modeling process. Some system science traditions, specifically system dynamics modeling, have an established participatory practice tradition. Yet, there remains limited guidance on engagement strategies using other modeling approaches like agent-based models. Our objective is to describe how we engaged adolescent youth in co-building an agent-based model about physical activity. Specifically, we aim to describe how we communicated technical aspects of agent-based models, the participatory activities we developed, and the resulting visual diagrams that were produced. We implemented six sessions with nine adolescent participants. To make technical aspects more accessible, we used an analogy that linked core components of agent-based models to elements of storytelling. We also implemented novel, facilitated activities that engaged youth in the development, annotation, and review of graphs over time, geographical maps, and state charts. The process was well-received by the participants and helped inform the basic structure of an agent-based model. The resulting visual diagrams created space for deeper discussion among participants about patterns of daily activity, important places for physical activity, and interactions between social and built environments. This work lays a foundation to develop and refine engagement strategies, especially for translating qualitative insights into quantitative model specifications such as ‘decision rules’."
https://openalex.org/W3098955568,"We studied the use of powered ankle-foot orthoses (PAFOs) and walking stability of the wearers, focusing on the ankle joint, which is known to play a critical role in gait stability. Recognizing that the subtalar joint is an important modulator of walking stability, we conducted the walking experiment on a treadmill by applying varying assistance techniques to the 2-degree-of-freedom (DOF) PAFO, which has the subtalar joint as the rotating axis, and the commonly used 1-DOF PAFO. The participants were 8 healthy men (mean±SD: height, 174.8±7.1 cm; weight, 69.8±6.5 kg; and age, 29.1±4.8 years) with no history of gait abnormality. Center of pressure (COP) was measured with an in-shoe pressure sensor, and stability was estimated on the basis of the angular acceleration measured with the inertial measurement unit attached to the trunk. The experimental results of the 2-DOF PAFO, with or without assistance, showed a significantly higher stability than those of the 1-DOF PAFO (up to 23.78%, p&lt;0.0326). With the 1-DOF PAFO, the stability deteriorated with the increase in the degree of assistance provided. With the 2-DOF PAFO, this tendency was not observed. Thus, the importance of the subtalar joint was proven using PAFOs. The mean position analysis of the COP during the stance phase confirmed that the COP highly correlated with stability (Pearson correlation coefficient: −0.6607). Thus, we conclude that only the 2-DOF PAFO can maintain walking stability, regardless of the assistance characteristics, by preserving the COP in the medial position through eversion. Awareness regarding the role of the subtalar joint is necessary during the manufacture or use of PAFOs, as lack of awareness could lead to the degradation of the wearer’s gait stability, regardless of effective assistance, and deteriorate the fundamental functionality of PAFO."
https://openalex.org/W3099804732,"Heat is a major abiotic stress that seriously affects watermelon ( Citrullus lanatus ) production. However, its effects may be mitigated through grafting watermelon to heat tolerant bottle gourd ( Lagenaria siceraria ) rootstocks. Understanding the genetic basis of heat tolerance and development of reliable DNA markers to indirectly select for the trait are necessary in breeding for new varieties with heat tolerance. The objectives of this study were to investigate the inheritance of heat tolerance and identify molecular markers associated with heat tolerance in bottle gourd. A segregating F 2 population was developed from a cross between two heat tolerant and sensitive inbred lines. The population was phenotyped for relative electrical conductivity (REC) upon high temperature treatment which was used as an indicator for heat tolerance. QTL-seq was performed to identify regions associated with heat tolerance. We found that REC-based heat tolerance in this population exhibited recessive inheritance. Seven heat-tolerant quantitative trait loci ( qHT1 . 1 , qHT2 . 1 , qHT2 . 2 , qHT5 . 1 , qHT6 . 1 , qHT7 . 1 , and qHT8 . 1 ) were identified with qHT2 . 1 being a promising major-effect QTL. In the qHT2 . 1 region, we identified three non-synonymous SNPs that were potentially associated with heat tolerance. These SNPs were located in the genes that may play roles in pollen sterility, intracellular transport, and signal recognition. Association of the three SNPs with heat tolerance was verified in segregating F 2 populations, which could be candidate markers for marker assisted selection for heat tolerance in bottle gourd. The qHT2 . 1 region is an important finding that may be used for fine mapping and discovery of novel genes associated with heat tolerance in bottle gourd."
https://openalex.org/W3104203945,"Objectives Islet transplantation is an emerging treatment option for type 1 diabetes but its application is limited by the shortage of human pancreas donors. Characterization of the N - and O -glycan surface antigens that vary between human and genetically engineered porcine islet donors could shed light on targets of antibody mediated rejection. Methods N - and O -glycans were isolated from human and adult porcine islets and analyzed using matrix-assisted laser-desorption time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS) and electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS/MS). Results A total of 57 porcine and 34 human N -glycans and 21 porcine and 14 human O -glycans were detected from cultured islets. Twenty-eight of which were detected only from porcine islets, which include novel xenoantigens such as high-mannose type N -glycans with core fucosylation and complex-type N -glycans with terminal neuraminic acid residues. Porcine islets have terminal N -glycolylneuraminic acid (NeuGc) residue in bi-antennary N -glycans and sialyl-Tn O -glycans. No galactose-α-1,3-galactose (α-Gal) or Sd a epitope were detected on any of the islets. Conclusions These results provide important insights into the potential antigenic differences of N - and O -glycan profiles between human and porcine islets. Glycan differences may identify novel gene targets for genetic engineering to generate superior porcine islet donors."
https://openalex.org/W3106054275,"Background Insecticide resistance is challenging the effectiveness of insecticide-based control interventions to reduce malaria burden in Africa. Understanding the molecular basis of insecticides resistance and patterns of gene flow in major malaria vectors such as Anopheles funestus are important steps for designing effective resistance management strategies. Here, we investigated the association between patterns of genetic structure and expression profiles of genes involved in the pyrethroid resistance in An . funestus across Uganda and neighboring Kenya. Methods Blood-fed mosquitoes An . funestus were collected across the four localities in Uganda and neighboring Kenya. A Microarray-based genome-wide transcription analysis was performed to identify the set of genes associated with permethrin resistance. 17 microsatellites markers were genotyped and used to establish patterns of genetic differentiation. Results Microarray-based genome-wide transcription profiling of pyrethroid resistance in four locations across Uganda (Arua, Bulambuli, Lira, and Tororo) and Kenya (Kisumu) revealed that resistance was mainly driven by metabolic resistance. The most commonly up-regulated genes in pyrethroid resistance mosquitoes include cytochrome P450s ( CYP9K1 , CYP6M7 , CYP4H18 , CYP4H17 , CYP4C36 ). However, expression levels of key genes vary geographically such as the P450 CYP6M7 [Fold-change (FC) = 115.8 (Arua) vs 24.05 (Tororo) and 16.9 (Kisumu)]. In addition, several genes from other families were also over-expressed including Glutathione S-transferases (GSTs), carboxylesterases, trypsin, glycogenin, and nucleotide binding protein which probably contribute to insecticide resistance across Uganda and Kenya. Genotyping of 17 microsatellite loci in the five locations provided evidence that a geographical shift in the resistance mechanisms could be associated with patterns of population structure throughout East Africa. Genetic and population structure analyses indicated significant genetic differentiation between Arua and other localities (F ST &gt;0.03) and revealed a barrier to gene flow between Arua and other areas, possibly associated with Rift Valley. Conclusion The correlation between patterns of genetic structure and variation in gene expression could be used to inform future interventions especially as new insecticides are gradually introduced."
https://openalex.org/W3098614382,"A cross-sectional survey was conducted in selected districts of Bangladesh to estimate the prevalence of bovine tuberculosis (bTB), and to identify the risk factors for bTB. We included 1865 farmed cattle from 79 herds randomly selected from five districts. Herd and animal level data were collected using semi-structured interviews with cattle herd owners. The single intradermal comparative tuberculin test (SICTT) was used to estimate the prevalence of bTB. The risk factors were identified using mixed-effect multiple logistic regression analyses. The overall herd and animal level prevalences of bTB were estimated to be 45.6% (95% Confidence Interval [CI] = 34.3–57.2%) and 11.3 (95% CI = 9.9–12.8%), respectively, using the OIE recommended &gt;4 mm cut-off. The true animal level prevalence of bTB was estimated to be 11.8 (95% Credible Interval = 2.1–20.3%). At the herd level, farm size, bTB history of the farm and type of husbandry were significantly associated with bTB status in univariable analysis. Similarly, age group, sex, pregnancy status and parity were significantly associated with bTB at cattle level. However, in multivariable analysis only herd size at the herd level and age group and pregnancy status at the cattle level were significant. Compared to a herd size of 1–10, the odds of bTB were 22.8 (95% CI: 5.2–100.9) and 45.6 times (95% CI: 5.0–417.7) greater in herd sizes of &gt;20–50 and &gt;50, respectively. The odds of bTB were 2.2 (95% CI: 1.0–4.5) and 2.5 times (95% CI: 1.1–5.4) higher in cattle aged &gt;3–6 years and &gt; 6 years, compared to cattle aged ≤1 year. Pregnancy increased the odds of bTB by 1.7 times (95% CI: 1.2–2.4) compared to non-pregnant cattle. Taken together, the results suggest high herd and animal level prevalence of bTB in these 5 districts, with the greatest risk of bTB in older and pregnant cattle within large herds (&gt;20), and highlight an urgent need for continued surveillance and implementation of bTB control programs in Bangladesh."
https://openalex.org/W3104398217,"The yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae has been the subject of many studies aimed at understanding mechanisms of adaptation to environmental stresses. Most of these studies have focused on adaptation to sub-lethal stresses, upon which a stereotypic transcriptional program called the environmental stress response (ESR) is activated. However, the genetic and regulatory factors that underlie the adaptation and survival of yeast cells to stresses that cross the lethality threshold have not been systematically studied. Here, we utilized a combination of gene expression profiling, deletion-library fitness profiling, and experimental evolution to systematically explore adaptation of S . cerevisiae to acute exposure to threshold lethal ethanol concentrations—a stress with important biotechnological implications. We found that yeast cells activate a rapid transcriptional reprogramming process that is likely adaptive in terms of post-stress survival. We also utilized repeated cycles of lethal ethanol exposure to evolve yeast strains with substantially higher ethanol tolerance and survival. Importantly, these strains displayed bulk growth-rates that were indistinguishable from the parental wild-type strain. Remarkably, these hyper-ethanol tolerant strains had reprogrammed their pre-stress gene expression states to match the likely adaptive post-stress response in the wild-type strain. Our studies reveal critical determinants of yeast survival to lethal ethanol stress and highlight potentially general principles that may underlie evolutionary adaptation to lethal stresses in general."
https://openalex.org/W3026004178,"The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has overwhelmingly demonstrated the need to accurately evaluate the effects of implementing new or altering existing nonpharmaceutical interventions. Since these interventions applied at the societal level cannot be evaluated through traditional experimental means, public health officials and other decision makers must rely on statistical and mathematical epidemiological models. Nonpharmaceutical interventions are typically focused on contacts between members of a population, and yet most epidemiological models rely on homogeneous mixing which has repeatedly been shown to be an unrealistic representation of contact patterns. An alternative approach is individual based models (IBMs), but these are often time intensive and computationally expensive to implement, requiring a high degree of expertise and computational resources. More often, decision makers need to know the effects of potential public policy decisions in a very short time window using limited resources. This paper presents an estimation algorithm for an IBM designed to evaluate nonpharmaceutical interventions. By utilizing recursive relationships, our method can quickly compute the expected epidemiological outcomes even for large populations based on any arbitrary contact network. We utilize our methods to evaluate the effects of relaxing current social distancing measures in Iowa, USA, at various times and to various degrees. \verb!R! code for our method is provided in the supplementary material, thereby allowing others to utilize our approach for other regions."
https://openalex.org/W3098827502,"Background The decision to take up colorectal cancer screening has to be made on informed grounds balancing benefits and harms. Self-administered decision aids can support citizens in making an informed choice. A self-administered web-based decision aid targeting citizens with lower educational attainment has been evaluated within the target population. However, the effectiveness in the general screening population remains unexplored. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of a web-based decision aid for colorectal cancer screening on components of informed choice among previous non-participants in colorectal cancer screening. Methods and findings The study was designed as a parallel randomised controlled trial among non-participants in colorectal cancer screening in Central Denmark Region (men and women aged 53–74 years). Respondents to baseline and follow-up questionnaires comprised the study population (n = 1,723). The intervention group received the decision aid electronically along with the second reminder. The control group received only the second reminder. The main outcomes (knowledge, attitudes, uptake and decisional conflict) were obtained through questionnaires data and from the Danish Colorectal Cancer Screening Database. The decision aid increased the uptake rate by 8 percentage points (95% CI: 3.4;12.6) but had no effect on either knowledge (scale score differences: 0.09; 95% CI: -0.05;0.24) or attitudes (0.45; 95% CI: -0.00;0.91). Decisional conflict decreased by 1.69 scale points (95% CI: -3.18;-0.20). The effect was similar across educational attainment levels. Conclusions The web-based decision aid offers a feasible way to provide individualised screening information in a ""one size fits all"" approach that may hold the potential to increase informed CRC screening uptake.

https://openalex.org/W3104935561,"Infants’ visual experiences are important for learning, and may depend on how information is structured in the visual field. This study examined how objects are distributed in 12-month-old infants’ field of view in a mobile play setting. Infants wore a mobile eye tracker that recorded their field of view and eye movements while they freely played with toys and a caregiver. We measured how centered and spread object locations were in infants’ field of view, and investigated how infant posture, object looking, and object distance affected the centering and spread. We found that far toys were less centered in infants’ field of view while infants were prone compared to when sitting or upright. Overall, toys became more centered in view and less spread in location when infants were looking at toys regardless of posture and toy distance. In sum, this study showed that infants’ visual experiences are shaped by the physical relation between infants’ bodies and the locations of objects in the world. However, infants are able to compensate for postural and environmental constraints by actively moving their head and eyes when choosing to look at an object."
https://openalex.org/W3105745174,"Background Namibia introduced the prevention of mother to child HIV transmission (MTCT) program in 2002 and lifelong antiretroviral therapy (ART) for pregnant women (option B-plus) in 2013. We sought to quantify MTCT measured at 4–12 weeks post-delivery. Methods During Aug 2014-Feb 2015, we recruited a nationally representative sample of 1040 pairs of mother and infant aged 4–12 weeks at routine immunizations in 60 public health clinics using two stage sampling approach. Of these, 864 HIV exposed infants had DNA-PCR HIV test results available. We defined an HIV exposed infant if born to an HIV-positive mother with documented status or diagnosed at enrollment using rapid HIV tests. Dried Blood Spots samples from HIV exposed infants were tested for HIV. Interview data and laboratory results were collected on smartphones and uploaded to a central database. We measured MTCT prevalence at 4–12 weeks post-delivery and evaluated associations between infant HIV infection and maternal and infant characteristics including maternal treatment and infant prophylaxis. All statistical analyses accounted for the survey design. Results Based on the 864 HIV exposed infants with test results available, nationally weighted early MTCT measured at 4–12 weeks post-delivery was 1.74% (95% confidence interval (CI): 1.00%-3.01%). Overall, 62% of mothers started ART pre-conception, 33.6% during pregnancy, 1.2% post-delivery and 3.2% never received ART. Mothers who started ART before pregnancy and during pregnancy had low MTCT prevalence, 0.78% (95% CI: 0.31%-1.96%) and 0.98% (95% CI: 0.33%-2.91%), respectively. MTCT rose to 4.13% (95% CI: 0.54%-25.68%) when the mother started ART after delivery and to 11.62% (95% CI: 4.07%-28.96%) when she never received ART. The lowest MTCT of 0.76% (95% CI: 0.36% - 1.61%) was achieved when mother received ART and ARV prophylaxis within 72hrs for infant and highest 22.32% (95%CI: 2.78% -74.25%) when neither mother nor infant received ARVs. After adjusting for mother’s age, maternal ART (Prevalence Ratio (PR) = 0.10, 95% CI: 0.03–0.29) and infant ARV prophylaxis (PR = 0.32, 95% CI: 0.10–0.998) remained strong predictors of HIV transmission. Conclusion As of 2015, Namibia achieved MTCT of 1.74%, measured at 4–12 weeks post-delivery. Women already on ART pre-conception had the lowest prevalence of MTCT emphasizing the importance of early HIV diagnosis and treatment initiation before pregnancy. Studies are needed to measure MTCT and maternal HIV seroconversion during breastfeeding."
https://openalex.org/W3105918619,"The development of insecticide-resistance mechanisms in aphids has been associated with inhibitory, pleiotropic fitness costs. Such fitness costs have not yet been examined in the UK’s most damaging cereal aphid, Sitobion avenae (grain aphid) (Hemiptera: Aphididae). This study aimed to evaluate the fitness trade-offs of the insecticide-resistant S . avenae clone versus an insecticide-susceptible S . avenae clone. Additionally, the parasitoid, Aphidius ervi (Hymenoptera: Braconidae), was introduced to examine its potential as a biological control agent. This study found that insecticide-resistant clones had significantly lower population growth and individual relative growth rate. Furthermore, insecticide-resistant clones suffered from a significantly greater rate of parasitisation (mummification) compared to their insecticide-susceptible counterparts. The successfulness of the parasitoid as a biological control agent could prevent the spread of the insecticide-resistant genotype. However, for this to be possible, insecticide spraying regimes need to be moderated, and habitat modification and parasitoid manipulation must be considered."
https://openalex.org/W3098022962,"Pioglitazone, a therapeutic drug for diabetes, possesses full PPAR-γ agonist activity and increase circulating adiponectin plasma concentration. Plasma adiponectin concentration decreases in hypertensive patients with renal dysfunctions. Present study investigated the reno-protective, altered excretory functions and renal haemodynamic responses to adrenergic agonists and ANG II following separate and combined therapy with pioglitazone in diabetic model of hypertensive rats. Pioglitazone was given orally [10mg/kg/day] for 28 days and adiponectin intraperitoneally [2.5μg/kg/day] for last 7 days. Groups of SHR received either pioglitazone or adiponectin in combination. A group of Wistar Kyoto rats [WKY] served as normotensive controls, whereas streptozotocin administered SHRs served as diabetic hypertensive rats. Metabolic data and plasma samples were taken on day 0, 8, 21 and 28. In acute studies, the renal vasoconstrictor actions of Angiotensin II [ANGII], noradrenaline [NA], phenylephrine [PE] and methoxamine [ME] were determined. Diabetic SHRs control had a higher basal mean arterial blood pressure than the WKY, lower RCBP and plasma adiponectin, higher creatinine clearance and urinary sodium excretion compared to WKY [all P&lt;0.05] which were normalized by the individual drug treatments and to greater degree following combined treatment. Responses to intra-renal administration of NA, PE, ME and ANGII were larger in diabetic SHR than WKY and SHRs [P&lt;0.05]. Adiponectin significantly blunted responses to NA, PE, ME and ANG II in diabetic treated SHRs by 40%, whereas the pioglitazone combined therapy with adiponectin further attenuated the responses to adrenergic agonists by 65%. [all P &lt;0.05]. These findings suggest that adiponectin possesses renoprotective effects and improves renal haemodynamics through adiponectin receptors and PPAR-γ in diabetic SHRs, suggesting that synergism exists between adiponectin and pioglitazone. A cross-talk relationship also supposed to exists between adiponectin receptors, PPAR-γ and alpha adrenoceptors in renal vasculature of diabetic SHRs."
https://openalex.org/W3101337147,"Background Advance psychiatric agreements could guide medical teams in providing care consistent with the incapacitated service user’s wishes. However, these types of agreements are rarely completed in Asian settings. What challenges can a traditionally paternalistic healthcare system expect to encounter when attempting to implement psychiatric advance directives? Methods We answered this research question by exploring the cultural, administrative and logistical challenges that might impede the implementation of the system supporting the service. We interviewed key stakeholders, 28 service users and 22 service providers, to seek their views and interests in the implementation of directives. We structured our analyses along a literature-review-based framework designed to guide further implementation studies, proposed by Nicaise and colleagues (2013). Accordingly, we divided our inductively generated themes into four longitudinal categories: pre-development stage, development stage, implementation stage, post-implementation stage. Results Overall, the findings indicated that many service users and service providers are interested in advance care planning. They believed that foreseeable challenges could be overcome with appropriate measures. However, the multiple challenges of implementation led some service providers to be ambivalent about their implementation and led service users to dismiss them. Specifically, factors related to the local culture in Singapore necessitated adjustments to the content and structure of the directives. These include language barriers in a multicultural society, conflicting wishes in a collectivist society, taboos for speaking about undesirable outcomes in a traditionalist society, and time limitations in a fast-paced society. Conclusion While culture-specific changes may be required to enable service users in a small Asian country to employ existing advance psychiatric agreement approaches, service providers and service users see their benefits. However, service providers must be mindful not to assume that service users are willing to defer every decision to their physician."

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with comorbid interstitial lung abnormalities and that with pulmonary fibrosis are considered different diseases; however, they could share a common spectrum. We aimed to evaluate the clinical characteristics of Japanese patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and comorbid interstitial lung abnormalities. In this prospective observational study, we analyzed data from the Ishinomaki COPD Network Registry. We evaluated the clinical characteristics of patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with and without comorbid interstitial lung abnormalities by comparing the annualized rate of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbations per patient during the observational period. Among 463 patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, 30 (6.5%) developed new interstitial lung abnormalities during the observational period. After 1-to-3 propensity score matching, we found that the annualized rate of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbations per patient during the observational period was 0.06 and 0.23 per year in the interstitial lung abnormality and control groups, respectively (P = 0.043). Our findings indicate slow progression of interstitial lung abnormality lesions in patients with pre-existing chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Further, interstitial lung abnormality development did not significantly influence on chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation. We speculate that post-chronic obstructive pulmonary disease interstitial lung abnormalities might involve smoking-related interstitial fibrosis, which is different from specific forms of fibrosing lung disease associated with poor prognoses."
https://openalex.org/W3106360430,"Background Patients with Diabetic Mellitus are at higher risk of different complications. Many previous studies show that anemia among diabetic patients is poorly diagnosed. Objective This study aimed to assess the magnitude and associated factors of anemia among adult diabetes patients having regular follow up at the diabetic clinic of Ayder Comprehensive Specialized Hospital, Tigray, 2018/19. Methods This study was conducted the Diabetic clinic of Ayder comprehensive specialized hospital, Tigray regional state, Northern Ethiopia from January to March 2019. A systematic random sampling technique was used to select study participants. About 5 ml of venous blood was collected by experienced laboratory technologists under a complete aseptic technique. Two ml of the venous blood was used for hemoglobin determination. And three ml of the venous blood was used without any anticoagulant for creatinine determination. The association of variables was assessed using bivariate and multivariable analysis in the logistic regression model with p-value, odds ratio, and 95% CI in the SPSS version 24 software. Results From a total of 262 diabetes patients, forty-seven (17.9%) were found to be anemic (6.7% males and 11.5% females). Among the related factors, residency (Adjusted Odds Ratio, 7.69, 95% CI, 2.060, 28.69, p = 0.002,), age of the patients (Adjusted Odds Ratio, 4.007, 95%CI, 1.53–10.51, p = 0.005,) and sex (Adjusted Odds Ratio, 3.434, 95% CI, 1.582, 7.458, p = 0.042,) were significantly associated with anemia. Conclusion According to this study, the magnitude of anemia is high among diabetic patients. Occupation of the participants, residency, HIV status, being female, and age was significantly associated with anemia."
https://openalex.org/W3103591048,"Background Short-course chemotherapy comprising isoniazid, rifampicin, ethambutol, and pyrazinamide has proved to be highly effective in the treatment of tuberculosis (TB). However, the most common adverse effect of this regimen leading to interruption of therapy is hepatotoxicity. There is a paucity of evidence in Tigray region on anti-tuberculosis drug-induced hepatitis. Therefore, this study aims to determine the magnitude, outcomes, and associated factors of drug-induced hepatitis in Ayder specialized comprehensive hospital tuberculosis clinic. Methods An institution-based cross-sectional study was done on 188 cases of patients who took anti-tuberculosis drugs from August 4, 2015 to June 30, 2018 in tuberculosis clinic, Ayder Comprehensive Specialized Hospital, Northern Ethiopia. Data on socio-demography, clinical characteristics and magnitude of the incidence and outcome of anti-tuberculosis drugs-induced hepatitis were collected using structured checklist from patients’ records using census method. Then, we entered and analyzed the data using statistical packages for social sciences (SPSS) statistical software version 21. Descriptive statistics were done in tables, counts, proportions, median and range. Bivariate and multivariable regression analyses were done to identify factors that are associated with drug-induced hepatitis. Confidence interval was taken at 95% and p-value of less than 0.05 was used to denote significance. Results We approached a total of 226 patients’ records, and we collected data from188 records (83.2%response rate). Anti-tuberculosis drug-induced hepatitis was found in 26 (13.8%) of the patients, of which 3 (11.54%) have died. Using multivariable logistic regression analyses, preexisting liver disease (AOR: 42.01, 95% CI: 4.22–417.49), taking other hepatotoxic drugs (AOR: 23.66, 95% CI: 1.77–314.79), and having lower serum albumin (AOR: 10.55, 95% CI: 2.57–43.32) were found to be significantly associated with the development of anti-tuberculosis drug-induced hepatitis. Conclusion and recommendation The incidence of anti-tuberculosis drug-induced hepatitis was high. Patients with low baseline serum albumin, taking other hepatotoxic drugs and having preexisting liver disease should be followed with serial liver enzymes after initiation of anti-tuberculosis medications. These patients should be followed with frequent measurement of liver enzymes to assess for the development of drug-induced hepatitis."

Little documentation exists regarding the history of domestication of Indonesian cattle and questions remain despite a growing body of molecular evidence. In this study, we genotyped seven Indonesian cattle breeds using an Illumina BovineSNP50 Bead Chip to provide insight into their domestication and demographic history in a worldwide population context. Our analyses indicated the presence of hybrid cattle, with Bos javanicus and Bos indicus ancestries being most prevalent, as well as purebred cattle. We revealed that all the breeds were interconnected through several migration events. However, their demographic status varied widely. Although almost all the Indonesian cattle had an effective population size higher than the minimum level required to ensure breed fitness, efforts are still needed to maintain their genetic variability and purity."
https://openalex.org/W3098045611,"Background Despite contributing to a significant reduction in rotavirus associated diarrhoea in highly burdened low- and middle-income countries, live attenuated, oral rotavirus vaccines have lower immunogenicity and efficacy in these settings in comparison to more developed countries. Breastmilk has been implicated among factors contributing to this lowered oral vaccine efficacy. We conducted in-vitro experiments to investigate the inhibitory effects of maternal antibody and other non-antibody components in breastmilk on rotavirus vaccine strain (Rotarix) multiplication in MA104 cell culture system and assessed associations with in-vivo vaccine seroconversion in vaccinated infants. Methods Breastmilk samples were collected from mothers before routine rotavirus vaccination of their infant at 6 weeks of age. For each sample, whole breastmilk, purified IgA, purified IgG and IgG and IgA depleted breastmilk samples were prepared as exposure preparations. A 96 well microtitre plate was set up for each sample including a control in which only MA104 cells were grown as well as a virus control with MA104 cells and virus only. The outcome of interest was 50% inhibition dilution of each of the exposure preparations calculated as the titer at which 50% of virus dilution was achieved. Samples from 30 women were tested and correlated to vaccine seroconversion status of the infant. HIV status was also correlated to antiviral breastmilk proteins. Results The mean 50% inhibitory dilution titer when whole breastmilk was added to virus infected MA104 cells was 14.3 (95% CI: 7.1, 22.7). Incubation with purified IgG resulted in a mean 50% inhibitory dilution of 5 (95%CI -1.6, 11.6). Incubating with purified IgA resulted in a mean 50% inhibitory dilution of 6.5 (95% CI -0.7, 13.7) and IgG and IgA depleted breastmilk did not yield any inhibition with a titer of 1.06 (95%CI 0.9, 1.2). Higher milk IgA levels contributed to a failure of infants to seroconvert. HIV was also not associated with any antiviral breastmilk proteins. Discussion and conclusion Whole breastmilk and breastmilk purified IgG and IgA fractions showed inhibitory activity against the rotavirus vaccine Rotarix™ whilst IgA and IgG depleted breastmilk with non-antibody breastmilk fraction failed to show any inhibition activity in-vitro . These findings suggest that IgA and IgG may have functional inhibitory properties and indicates a possible mechanism of how mothers in rotavirus endemic areas with high titres of IgA and IgG may inhibit viral multiplication in the infant gut and would potentially contribute to the failure of their infants to serocovert. There was not association of HIV with either lactoferrin, lactadherin or tenascin-C concentrations."
https://openalex.org/W3099948129,"Background During their workday, nurses face a variety of stressors that are dealt with using different coping strategies. One criticism of the contextual models of work stress is that they fail to focus on individual responses like coping with stress. Neverthless, little is know about the momentary determinants of coping in nurses. Objectives To identify the momentary predictors of problem-focused approaching coping and emotion-focused approaching coping, as well as those for seeking social support and refusal coping strategies, during the working day in nurses. Design This study uses descriptive, correlational, two-level design with repeated measures. Settings Wards of two University hospitals. Participants A random cohort of 113 nurses was studied. Methods An ecological momentary assessment was made of demand, control, effort, reward, nursing task, coping, mood and fatigue, and of coping style by questionnaire. Multilevel two-level statistical analyses were performed in order to identify both within person and between person relationships. Results Different momentary types of coping were associated with different tasks. The problem-focused coping could be explained by the direct care and medication tasks, demand, planning coping style, mood, and negatively by acceptation coping style. Emotion-focused coping could be explained by documentation and medication tasks (negatively), mood, demand, distraction, and disengagement coping styles. Seeking social support coping could be explained by the task of communication, mood, fatigue (negatively), and seeking emotional support as a coping style. Refusal coping could be explained by mood, and the coping style of focusing and venting emotions. Refusal coping is not specific to any task. Conclusions The choice of the coping strategy depends on the task, of their appraisal and on the different styles of coping."
https://openalex.org/W3101680383,"Purpose To evaluate the characteristics and morphological alterations in central retinal ischemia caused by diabetic retinopathy (DR) or retinal vein occlusion (RVO) as seen in optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) and their relationship to visual acuity. Methods Swept-source optical coherence tomography (SSOCT) and OCTA (Topcon, Triton) data of patients with central involving retinal ischemia were analyzed in this cross-sectional study. The following parameters were evaluated: vessel parameters, foveal avascular zone (FAZ), intraretinal cysts (IRC), microaneurysms (MA), vascular collaterals in the superficial (SCP) and deep plexuses (DCP), hyperreflective foci (HRF), epiretinal membrane (ERM), external limiting membrane (ELM) and ellipsoid zone (EZ) disruption, as well as the disorganization of retinal inner layers (DRIL). Best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA), age, gender, disease duration and ocular history were also recorded. Results 44 eyes of 44 patients (22 with RVO, 22 with DR) were analyzed. The mean age was 60.55 ± 11.38 years and mean BCVA 0.86 ± 0.36 (Snellen, 6m). No significant difference was found between DR subgroups (non proliferative vs. proliferative). Between RVO subgroups (CRVO vs. BRVO) a significant difference was found in term of collateral vessel of the DCP (p = 0.014). A pooled DR and RVO group were created and compared. Significantly more MAs (p = 0.007) and ERM (p = 0.007) were found in the DR group. Statistically significant negative correlation was demonstrated between FAZ and BCVA (p = 0.45) when analyzing all patients with retinal ischemia. Conclusion This study has shown that the best predictor of visual outcome in center involved ischemic diseases is the size of FAZ. Besides the presence of MAs and ERM, all other OCT and OCTA parameters were present in a similar extent in DR and RVO group despite the completely different disease origins. Our results suggest that as soon as retinal ischemia in the macular region is present, it has a similar appearance and visual outcome independently of the underlying disease."
https://openalex.org/W3106346181,"Background The six-minute pegboard and ring test (6-PBRT) has been used to evaluate functional capacity of the upper limbs in stable chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients. To the best of our knowledge, no studies have evaluated dynamic hyperinflation (DH) during exercise with upper limbs in the hospital setting. The aim of this study was to evaluate physiological responses and DH induced by 6-PBRT in hospitalized patients with acute exacerbation of COPD (AECOPD). Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted in a tertiary hospital enrolling patients who were hospitalized due to AECOPD. All included participants underwent an evaluation of lung function and 6-PBRT when they reached minimum clinical criteria. Ventilatory and hemodynamics parameters were monitored during 6-PBRT and until 6 minutes of rest after the test. Symptoms of dyspnea and upper limb fatigue were also measured. Results Eighteen patients (71.3±5.1 years) with a mean FEV 1 of 43.2±18.3% were included in the study (11 females). Prevalence of DH after 6-PBRT was 50% (considering the drop of 150 ml or 10% of inspiratory capacity, immediately after the end of the test). There was a significant increase in respiratory rate, minute volume, dyspnea, and upper limb fatigue after the end of 6-PBRT (p&lt;0.05). Dyspnea recovered more precociously than the perception of fatigue, being reestablished within four minutes of rest. An increase in heart rate, systolic and diastolic blood pressures was also induced by 6-PBRT (p&lt;0.05), requiring 6 minutes of recovery to return to baseline. No adverse events were observed during 6-PBRT. We concluded that 6-PBRT induces physiological changes during its execution, at safe levels, requiring a maximum of 6 minutes for recovery. Finally, the test proved to be safe and applicable for patients hospitalized due to AECOPD."
https://openalex.org/W3102193324,"Background The potential role of perceived learning difficulty on depressive symptoms and substance use in the context of student population was seldom studied. This study aimed to investigate the association of perceived learning difficulty with depressive symptoms and substance use among university students in northwest Ethiopia. Methods A cross sectional study was conducted on 710 pre-engineering students. A locally validated version of Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) was used to assess depressive symptoms at a cut off 5–9 indicating mild depressive symptoms and at a cut off 10 for major depressive symptoms. Perceived difficulty in school work was assessed by items dealing about difficulties in areas of course work. The response alternatives of these items were 0 = not at all, 1 = not so much, 2 = quite much, 3 = very much. The types of substances that students had used in their life and in the last three months were assessed. Negative binomial regression and multinomial regressions were employed to investigate the predictors of number of substance use and depressive symptoms respectively. Results The prevalence of depressive symptoms was 71.4% (Mild: 30% and Major 41.4%). About 24.6% of participants had the experience of using at least one substance. Increment in perceived difficulties in learning score was associated with more use of substances (aRRR = 1.03, 95% CI: 1.01–1.06), mild level depressive symptoms (aOR = 1.10, 95% CI: 1.04, 1.56 and major depressive symptoms (aOR = 1.19, 95% CI: 1.13, 1.26). Every increment in anxiety score was associated with increased risk of mild level of depressive symptoms (aOR = 1.09, 95% CI: 1.01, 1.17) and major depressive symptoms (aOR = 1.28, 95% CI: 1.18, 1.37). Being male (aRRR = 5.54, 95% CI: 3.28, 9.36), urban residence (aRRR = 2.46, 95% CI: 1.62, 3.72) and increment in number of life threatening events (aRRR = 1.143, 95% CI: 1.08, 1.22) were associated with increased risk of substance use. Conclusion Perceived difficulties in learning independently predicted increased depressive symptoms as well as substance use among participants."

https://openalex.org/W3100087586,"As a means of obtaining reproducible and accurate numbers of larvae for laboratory rearing, we tested a large-particle flow-cytometer type device called the ‘Automated Particle Counter’ (APC). The APC is a gravity-fed, self-contained unit that detects changes in light intensity caused by larvae passing the detector in a water stream and controls dispensing by stopping the flow when the desired number has been reached. We determined the accuracy (number dispensed compared to the target value) and precision (distribution of number dispensed) of dispensing at a variety of counting sensitivity thresholds and larva throughput rates (larvae per second) using &lt; 1-day old Anopheles gambiae and Aedes aegypti larvae. All measures were made using an APC algorithm called the ‘Smoothed Z-Score’ which allows the user to define how many standard deviations (Z scores) from the baseline light intensity a particle’s absorbance must exceed to register a count. We dispensed a target number of 100 An . gambiae larvae using Z scores from 2.5–8 and observed no difference among them in the numbers dispensed for scores from 2.5–6, however, scores of 7 and 8 under-counted (over-dispensed) larvae. Using a Z score ≤ 6, we determined the effect of throughput rate on the accuracy of the device to dispense An . gambiae larvae. For rates ≤ 98 larvae per second, the accuracy of dispensing a target of 100 larvae was - 2.29% ± 0.72 (95% CI of the mean) with a mode of 99 (49 of 348 samples). When using a Z score of 3.5 and rates ≤ 100 larvae per second, the accuracy of dispensing a target of 100 Ae . aegypti was - 2.43% ± 1.26 (95% CI of the mean) with a mode of 100 (6 of 42 samples). No effect on survival was observed on the number of An . gambiae first stage larvae that reached adulthood as a function of dispensing."
https://openalex.org/W3100863913,"This study investigated in cross-country and panel form the interactions of bank development, stock market development and global equity index, focusing on the BRICS countries covering the period 1990 to 2018. We found a bidirectional causation between bank development (CPSGDP) and stock market performance as proxied by the depth of the markets (MCAPGDP) in the BRICS countries. Cointegration was also found using the panel cointegration framework and the bounds test for the ARDL estimators. This largely proves that a long-run relationship of both direct and reverse nature exists between bank development and stock market performance. For the bank development and market performance models respectively, all the error-correction terms were found to be negatively significant, indicating that they both share dynamic profile and adjust appreciably to deviations from equilibrium between the short run and the long run. The global equity index showed that stock market development interacts more with the global financial environment than bank development in the BRICS countries. Our findings support the complementarity and coevolution hypothesis in the stock market and bank development nexus."
https://openalex.org/W3105171931,"Background Co-infection with malaria and intestinal parasites is common in children in Africa and may affect their immune response to a malaria parasite infection. Prior studies suggest that co-infections may lead to increased susceptibility to malaria infection and disease severity; however, other studies have shown the reverse. Knowledge on how co-morbidities specifically affect the immune response to malaria antigens is limited. Therefore, this study sought to determine the prevalence of co-infection of malaria and intestinal parasites and its association with antibody levels to malaria merozoite antigens. Methods A cross sectional study was carried out in two villages with high transmission of malaria in Cameroon (Ngali II and Mfou) where mass drug administration (MDA) had been administered at ~6-month intervals (generally with albendazole or mebendazole). Children aged 1–15 years were enrolled after obtaining parental consent. A malaria rapid diagnostic test was used on site. Four (4) ml of peripheral blood was collected from each participant to determine Plasmodium falciparum infections by microscopy, haemoglobin levels and serology. Fresh stool samples were collected and examined by wet mount, Kato-Katz method and modified Ritchie concentration techniques. A Multiplex Analyte Platform assay was used to measure antibody levels. Results A total of 320 children were enrolled. The prevalence of malaria by blood smear was 76.3% (244/320) and prevalence of malaria and intestinal parasites was 16.9% (54/320). Malaria prevalence was highest in young children; whereas, intestinal parasites (IP+) were not present until after 3 years of age. All children positive for malaria had antibodies to MSP1 42 , MSP2, MSP3 and EBA175. No difference in antibody levels in children with malaria-co infections compared to malaria alone were found, except for antibody levels to EBA-175 were higher in children co-infected with intestinal protozoa (p = 0.018), especially those with Entamoeba histolytica infections (p = 0.0026). Conclusion Antibody levels to EBA175 were significantly higher in children co-infected with malaria and E . histolytica compared to children infected with malaria alone. It is important to further investigate why and how the presence of these protozoans might modulate the immune response to malaria antigens."

The consistency and asymptotic normality properties of the estimators are obtained. The proposed method has the advantage that does not require the censoring vectors to be identically distributed. The effectiveness of the method is verified by some simulation studies and a real data example."
https://openalex.org/W3105038322,"A manta ray biomimetic glider is designed and studied with both laboratory experiments and numerical simulations with a new dynamic update method called the motion-based zonal mesh update method (MBZMU method) to reveal its hydrodynamic performance. Regarding the experimental study, an ejection gliding experiment is conducted for qualitative verification, and a hydrostatic free-fall experiment is conducted to quantitatively verify the reliability of the corresponding numerical simulation. Regarding the numerical simulation, to reduce the trend of nose-up movement and to obtain a long lasting and stable gliding motion, a series of cases with the center of mass offset forward by different distances and different initial angles of attack have been calculated. The results show that the glider will show the optimal gliding performance when the center of mass is 20mm in front of the center of geometry and the initial attack angle range lies between A 0 = -5° to A 0 = -2.5° at the same time. The optimal gliding distance can reach six times its body length under these circumstances. Furthermore, the stability of the glider is explained from the perspective of Blended-Wing-Body (BWB) configuration."
https://openalex.org/W3102041972,"Introduction Diabetes imposes large health and financial burdens on Medicare beneficiaries. Type 2 diabetes can be prevented or delayed through lifestyle modification programs. In 2018, Medicare began to offer the Medicare Diabetes Prevention Program (MDPP), a lifestyle intervention, to eligible beneficiaries nationwide. The number of MDPP-eligible beneficiaries is not known, but this information is essential in efforts to expand the program and increase enrollment. This study aimed to estimate the number and spatial variation of MDPP-eligible Part B beneficiaries at the county level and by urban–rural classification. Methods Data from 2011–2016 National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys and a survey-weighted logistic regression model were used to estimate proportions of prediabetes in the United States by sex, age, and race/ethnicity based on the MDPP eligibility criteria. The results from the predictive model were applied to 2015 Medicare Part B beneficiaries to estimate the number of MDPP-eligible beneficiaries. The National Center for Health Statistics’ Urban–Rural Classification Scheme for Counties from 2013 were used to define urban and rural categories. Results An estimated 5.2 million (95% CI = 3.5–7.0 million) Part B beneficiaries were eligible for the MDPP. By state, estimates ranged from 13,000 (95% CI = 8,500–18,000) in Alaska to 469,000 (95% CI = 296,000–641,000) in California. There were 2,149 counties with ≤1,000 eligible beneficiaries and 11 with &gt;25,000. Consistent with demographic patterns, urban counties had more eligible beneficiaries than rural counties. Conclusions These estimates could be used to plan locations for new MDPPs and reach eligible Part B beneficiaries for enrollment."
