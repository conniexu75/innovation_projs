https://openalex.org/W2071024396,"MicroRNA-183 (miR-183), miR-96, and miR-182 comprising the miR-183/96/182 cluster are highly expressed in photoreceptor cells. Although in vitro data have indicated an important role for this cluster in the retina, details of its in vivo biological activity are still unknown. To observe the impact of the miR-183/96/182 cluster on retinal maintenance and light adaptation, we generated a sponge transgenic mouse model that disrupted the activities of the three-component microRNAs simultaneously and selectively in the retina. Although our morphological and functional studies showed no differences between transgenic and wild type mice under normal laboratory lighting conditions, sponge transgenic mice displayed severe retinal degeneration after 30 min of exposure to 10,000 lux light. Histological studies showed that the outer nuclear layer thickness was dramatically reduced in the superior retina of transgenic mice. Real time PCR experiments in both the sponge transgenic mouse model and different microRNA stable cell lines identified Arrdc3, Neurod4, and caspase-2 (Casp2) as probable downstream targets of this cluster, a result also supported by luciferase assay and immunoblotting analyses. Further studies indicated that expression of both the cluster and Casp2 increased in response to light exposure. Importantly, Casp2 expression was enhanced in transgenic mice, and inhibition of Casp2 partially rescued their light-induced retinal degeneration. By connecting the microRNA and apoptotic pathways, these findings imply an important role for the miR-183/96/182 cluster in acute light-induced retinal degeneration of mice. This study demonstrates a clear involvement of miRs in the physiology of postmitotic cells in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2040836496,"The 15-kDa selenoprotein (Sep15) is a thioredoxin-like, endoplasmic reticulum-resident protein involved in the quality control of glycoprotein folding through its interaction with UDP-glucose:glycoprotein glucosyltransferase. Expression of Sep15 is regulated by dietary selenium and the unfolded protein response, but its specific function is not known. In this study, we developed and characterized Sep15 KO mice by targeted removal of exon 2 of the Sep15 gene coding for the cysteine-rich UDP-glucose:glycoprotein glucosyltransferase-binding domain. These KO mice synthesized a mutant mRNA, but the shortened protein product could be detected neither in tissues nor in Sep15 KO embryonic fibroblasts. Sep15 KO mice were viable and fertile, showed normal brain morphology, and did not activate endoplasmic reticulum stress pathways. However, parameters of oxidative stress were elevated in the livers of these mice. We found that Sep15 mRNA was enriched during lens development. Further phenotypic characterization of Sep15 KO mice revealed a prominent nuclear cataract that developed at an early age. These cataracts did not appear to be associated with severe oxidative stress or glucose dysregulation. We suggest that the cataracts resulted from an improper folding status of lens proteins caused by Sep15 deficiency."
https://openalex.org/W2135306073,"In pharmacology, it is essential to identify the molecular mechanisms of drug action in order to understand adverse side effects. These adverse side effects have been used to infer whether two drugs share a target protein. However, side-effect similarity of drugs could also be caused by their target proteins being close in a molecular network, which as such could cause similar downstream effects. In this study, we investigated the proportion of side-effect similarities that is due to targets that are close in the network compared to shared drug targets. We found that only a minor fraction of side-effect similarities (5.8 %) are caused by drugs targeting proteins close in the network, compared to side-effect similarities caused by overlapping drug targets (64%). Moreover, these targets that cause similar side effects are more often in a linear part of the network, having two or less interactions, than drug targets in general. Based on the examples, we gained novel insight into the molecular mechanisms of side effects associated with several drug targets. Looking forward, such analyses will be extremely useful in the process of drug development to better understand adverse side effects."
https://openalex.org/W2106478568,"Retinitis pigmentosa (RP) is a heterogeneous group of inherited neurodegenerative diseases affecting photoreceptors and causing blindness. Many human cases are caused by mutations in the rhodopsin gene. An important question regarding RP pathology is whether different genetic defects trigger the same or different cell death mechanisms. To answer this question, we analysed photoreceptor degeneration in P23H and S334ter transgenic rats carrying rhodopsin mutations that affect protein folding and sorting respectively. We found strong activation of calpain and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) in both mutants, concomitant with calpastatin down-regulation, increased oxidative DNA damage and accumulation of PAR polymers. These parameters were strictly correlated with the temporal progression of photoreceptor degeneration, mirroring earlier findings in the phosphodiesterase-6 mutant rd1 mouse, and suggesting execution of non-apoptotic cell death mechanisms. Interestingly, activation of caspases-3 and -9 and cytochrome c leakage-key events in apoptotic cell death--were observed only in the S334ter mutant, which also showed increased expression of PARP-1. The identification of the same metabolic markers triggered by different mutations in two different species suggests the existence of common cell death mechanisms, which is a major consideration for any mutation independent treatment."
https://openalex.org/W2053359627,"Both TRPC6 and reactive oxygen species (ROS) play an important role in regulating vascular function. However, their interplay has not been explored. The present study examined whether activation of TRPC6 in vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) by ROS was a physiological mechanism for regulating vascular tone by vasoconstrictors. In A7r5 cells, arginine vasopressin (AVP) evoked a striking Ca(2+) entry response that was significantly attenuated by either knocking down TRPC6 using siRNA or inhibition of NADPH oxidases with apocynin or diphenyleneiodonium. Inhibition of TRPC6 or ROS production also decreased AVP-stimulated membrane currents. In primary cultured aortic VSMCs, catalase and diphenyleneiodonium significantly suppressed AVP- and angiotensin II-induced whole cell currents and Ca(2+) entry, respectively. In freshly isolated and endothelium-denuded thoracic aortas, hyperforin (an activator of TRPC6), but not its vehicle, induced dose- and time-dependent constriction in TRPC6 wide type (WT) mice. This response was not observed in TRPC6 knock-out (KO) mice. Consistent with the ex vivo study, hyperforin stimulated a robust Ca(2+) entry in the aortic VSMCs from WT mice but not from KO mice. Phenylephrine induced a dose-dependent contraction of WT aortic segments, and this response was inhibited by catalase. Moreover, H(2)O(2) itself evoked Ca(2+) influx and inward currents in A7r5 cells, and these responses were significantly attenuated by either inhibition of TRPC6 or blocking vesicle trafficking. H(2)O(2) also induced inward currents in primary VSMCs from WT but not from TRPC6 KO mice. Additionally, H(2)O(2) stimulated a dose-dependent constriction of the aortas from WT mice but not from the vessels of KO mice. Furthermore, TIRFM showed that H(2)O(2) triggered membrane trafficking of TRPC6 in A7r5 cells. These results suggest a new signaling pathway of ROS-TRPC6 in controlling vessel contraction by vasoconstrictors."

Collagen remodeling is a crucial process in many normal physiological events and in several pathological conditions. Some collagen subtypes contain specific carbohydrate side chains, the function of which is poorly known. The endocytic collagen receptor urokinase plasminogen activator receptor-associated protein (uPARAP)/Endo180 plays an important role in matrix remodeling through its ability to internalize collagen for lysosomal degradation. uPARAP/Endo180 is a member of the mannose receptor protein family. These proteins all include a fibronectin type II domain and a series of C-type lectin-like domains, of which only a minor part possess carbohydrate recognition activity. At least two of the family members, uPARAP/Endo180 and the mannose receptor, interact with collagens. The molecular basis for this interaction is known to involve the fibronectin type II domain but nothing is known about the function of the lectin domains in this respect. In this study, we have investigated a possible role of the single active lectin domain of uPARAP/Endo180 in the interaction with collagens. By expressing truncated recombinant uPARAP/Endo180 proteins and analyzing their interaction with collagens with high and low levels of glycosylation we demonstrated that this lectin domain interacts directly with glycosylated collagens. This interaction is functionally important because it was found to modulate the endocytic efficiency of the receptor toward highly glycosylated collagens such as basement membrane collagen IV. Surprisingly, this property was not shared by the mannose receptor, which internalized glycosylated collagens independently of its lectin function. This role of modulating its uptake efficiency by a specific receptor is a previously unrecognized function of collagen glycosylation.

The collagens make up by far the most abundant component. Collagens are trimeric proteins that form unique triple helices and assemble into large supramolecular structures such as fibers and sheets, enabling them to form the barriers and structures of the ECM (4Khoshnoodi J.

Collagens undergo a range of post-translational modifications, including extensive hydroxylation of prolyl and lysyl residues, N- and O-linked glycosylation, and processing of proforms (5Prockop D.J. Kivirikko K.I. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 403-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (1373) Google Scholar). The hydroxylation of proline and lysine residues plays a role in triple helix stabilization and cross-linking of collagen molecules and the processing of proforms is important for the assembly of collagens into fibrillar structures (6Gelse K. Pöschl E. Aigner T. Adv. Drug Deliv. Rev. 2003; 55: 1531-1546Crossref PubMed Scopus (1588) Google Scholar). In contrast, the role of collagen glycosylation is poorly understood. Most is known about the O-linked glycosylation and this type of collagen glycosylation is composed of a single galactose unit or a disaccharide consisting of galactose and glucose attached to hydroxylated lysine residues (7Spiro R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1967; 242: 4813-4823Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The level of O-glycosylation varies greatly between different types of collagen and between different tissues. The network-forming collagen type IV of the basement membrane and the fibrillar collagen type V have high levels of glycosylation (8Kresina T.F. Miller E.J.

Some studies have demonstrated an importance of glycosylation in collagen function in processes of mouse development, however, the mechanism of action remains unknown (14Rautavuoma K. Takaluoma K.

In particular, it is an open question if collagen glycosylation affects collagen interaction with other proteins and processes like collagen turnover. Collagen turnover is complex and involves different mechanisms and degradation pathways. The unique structure of collagens makes them resilient to most means of proteolytic attack and only relatively few proteases are known to degrade collagens in their native state. Most of these active collagenases are secreted or membrane-bound members of the matrix metalloproteinase family (17Lauer-Fields J.L. Juska D. Fields G.B. Biopolymers. 2002; 66: 19-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar, 18Song F. Wisithphrom K. Zhou J. Windsor L.J. Front. Biosci. 2006; 11: 3100-3120Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). However, in addition to extracellular degradation, a pathway for intracellular degradation of collagen has been identified (19Mohamed M.M. Sloane B.F. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2006; 6: 764-775Crossref PubMed Scopus (1005) Google Scholar). This pathway involves collagen endocytosis mediated by the urokinase plasminogen activator receptor-associated protein (uPARAP) (20Behrendt N. Biol.

In some processes the receptor operates together with extracellular collagen degradation mechanisms and it is effective in internalizing the large cleavage products resulting from initial extracellular collagenase digestion (36Wagenaar-Miller R.A.

The importance of this pathway of collagen turnover in vivo was emphasized in a recent study of a devastating hereditary bone defect in cattle, which turned out to be caused by an inactivating frameshift mutation in the uPARAP encoding gene (39Fasquelle C. Sartelet A. Li W. Dive M. Tamma N. Michaux C. Druet T. Huijbers I.J. Isacke C.M. Coppieters W. Georges M. Charlier C. PLoS Genet. 2009; 5: e1000666Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The involvement of uPARAP in extracellular matrix remodeling has underscored the importance of understanding the molecular basis of the ligand interactions of the receptor and several studies during the last decade have provided information in this regard. uPARAP consists of a large extracellular part, a transmembrane domain, and a short cytoplasmic domain (Fig. 1A). The extracellular part of uPARAP includes 10 domains as predicted from the amino acid sequence (21Sheikh H. Yarwood H. Ashworth A. Isacke C.M. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 1021-1032Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 40Behrendt N. Jensen O.N. Engelholm L.H. M⊘rtz E. Mann M. Dan⊘ K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1993-2002Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). The collagen binding activity of uPARAP has been ascribed to a fibronectin type II (FN-II) domain in the protein structure, whereas the other domains of the receptor have so far been considered devoid of collagen interaction sites (30Wienke D. MacFadyen J.R. Isacke C.M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 3592-3604Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 31East L. McCarthy A. Wienke D. Sturge J. Ashworth A. Isacke C.M. EMBO Rep. 2003; 4: 710-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the receptor includes eight C-type lectin-like domains (CTLD1–8) but only one of these, CTLD-2, possesses lectin activity (41East L. Rushton S. Taylor M.E. Isacke C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 50469-50475Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). This domain includes an essential calcium-binding site and specifically binds a range of monosaccharides, including mannose, glucose, and N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc), in a calcium-dependent reaction (41East L. Rushton S. Taylor M.E. Isacke C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 50469-50475Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). However, no biological ligand has so far been associated with the lectin activity of uPARAP. In the present work, we show that CTLD-2 of uPARAP participates in the binding to specific collagens with a high degree of glycosylation, that CTLD-2 indeed interacts directly with carbohydrate residues on collagens through its lectin function, and that the resulting combined activity of FN-II and CTLD-2 serves to specifically increase the binding of uPARAP to glycosylated collagens. Furthermore, we demonstrate an impact of this lectin activity on the efficiency of uPARAP-dependent collagen internalization in cultured cells. Through this mechanism, the type-specific and dynamic pattern of collagen glycosylation may add to determine the efficiency of collagen turnover through the uPARAP-mediated endocytic degradation route. Surprisingly, we find that this lectin dependence in collagen internalization is limited to uPARAP because the related collagen endocytosis receptor, the mannose receptor (MR) (42Martinez-Pomares L.

These proteins comprise the first three N-terminal domains (Gly31–Ala365), the first four N-terminal domains (Gly31–Leu510), and all of the 10 extracellular domains (Gly31–Ser1402) in the human uPARAP sequence, respectively (21Sheikh H.

In brief, the DNA sequences encoding D1–3 and D1–4 were amplified by PCR from a uPARAP expression vector (37Madsen D.H. Engelholm L.H. Ingvarsen S. Hillig T. Wagenaar-Miller R.A. Kj⊘ller L.

The following synthetic oligonucleotide primers were used in the PCR: 5′-TCTCTCGAGAAAAGAGGCGCCCCTGGGGACGCCGC-3′ (for amplification of both D1–3 and D1–4), 5′-GCTCTAGATTAATGATGATGATGATGATGGGCGTTGGGCTTCTTCTTGC-3′ (for D1–3), and 5′-GCTCTAGATTAATGATGATGATGATGATGCAGCTGGCCTGCCTTCTTGC-3′ (for D1–4). Restriction enzyme recognition sites are in bold. The DNA encoding the specified sequences were inserted at a position leading to N-terminal fusion with a P. pastoris signal sequence to allow protein export into the growth medium and processing mediated by the host cell. The recombinant proteins were purified from filtered supernatant from overnight P. pastoris cultures using Ni2+-chelating chromatography on an ÄKTA purifier system (GE Healthcare) and elution with a linear imidazole gradient ranging from 0.005 to 1 m. Homogenous protein preparations were obtained by enzymatic deglycosylation, treating the elution fractions (protein concentration 0.1–0.5 mg/ml) with EndoH (2000 units/ml) in 50 mm sodium citrate buffer, pH 5.5, for 1 h at room temperature. A second round of Ni2+-chelating chromatography was then performed to remove EndoH enzyme. The D1–10 recombinant uPARAP protein construct was fused to a purification tag (the third domain of the urokinase receptor), produced in Drosophila Schneider S2 cells, and purified by affinity chromatography as previously described (37Madsen D.H.

SDS-PAGE analysis of D1–10 was performed under nonreducing conditions and 5 μg of this protein was loaded. Following SDS-PAGE proteins were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. Dynamic analysis of collagen-uPARAP interactions was performed using a BIAcore2000 instrument (GE Healthcare), using conditions slightly modified from the method previously described (37Madsen D.H. Engelholm L.H. Ingvarsen S. Hillig T. Wagenaar-Miller R.A. Kj⊘ller L. Gårdsvoll H. H⊘yer-Hansen G. Holmbeck K. Bugge T.H. Behrendt N. J. Biol.

The anti-uPARAP catching antibody (mAb 2h9) was coupled to the surface of a BIAcore CM5 sensor chip, after which D1–3 and D1–4 recombinant proteins were immobilized by injection into individual flow channels. Due to the binding characteristics of mAb 2h9, this leads to a near irreversible immobilization of the uPARAP proteins (37Madsen D.H. Engelholm L.H. Ingvarsen S. Hillig T. Wagenaar-Miller R.A. Kj⊘ller L. Gårdsvoll H. H⊘yer-Hansen G. Holmbeck K. Bugge T.H. Behrendt N. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 27037-27045Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). To allow comparison, approximately equal molar amounts of D1–4 and D1–3 were immobilized by this procedure (molar ratios D1–4/D1–3 of 1:0.87 and 1:1.18 for the experiments shown in Fig. 2, A and C and Fig. 2, B and D, respectively). Collagens type I and IV were preincubated in assay buffer (10 mm HEPES, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 0.005% surfactant P20, pH 7.4) and were then injected into the flow cells with immobilized uPARAP variants at a flow rate of 10 μl/min for 10 min. In experiments with denatured collagen, collagen I was incubated at 65 °C for 20 min prior to injection. Following injection, dissociation was recorded in two phases: an initial 4-min phase performed in assay buffer alone followed by a 10-min phase performed in assay buffer supplemented with interaction inhibitors (EDTA (10 mm) or GlcNAc (50 mm)). Binding and dissociation were recorded at 20 °C. After each round of collagen injection and dissociation, the chip was regenerated by two pulses of 1 min each with 10 mm glycine/HCl, pH 2.0. A reference flow channel without coupled protein or with mAb 2h9 alone (no recombinant uPARAP) allowed for buffer bulk subtraction throughout each sensorgram. No binding of collagen was observed in the reference channels. The interaction of uPARAP with immobilized collagens was analyzed using an ELISA setup with heat-denatured collagens type I, IV, and V. Collagens were diluted to 10 μg/ml in coating buffer (0.1 m Na2CO3, pH 9.8) and incubated for 20 min at 65 °C before being coated onto the surface of wells in 96-well Nunc Maxisorp plates (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) at 4 °C overnight. Subsequently, blocking of nonspecific binding sites was performed with either 2.5% ELISA blocking reagent (Roche Diagnostics, used for D1–3 and D1–4 experiments) or 2% skimmed milk powder (Irma, Copenhagen, Denmark, used for D1–10) for 30 min at room temperature. Solutions of 27 nm D1–3 or D1–4, or 55 nm D1–10 were then added to the wells in binding buffer (50 mm HEPES, 20 mm KCl, 100 mm NaCl, 10 mg/ml of BSA, 0.1% Tween 20, pH 7.4), either supplemented with CaCl2 (1 mm), or with interaction inhibitors (EDTA (3 mm) or mannose (50 mm)). Ligand binding was performed at 4 °C overnight. Binding was detected with primary mouse anti-uPARAP antibody (mAb 2h9, 10 μg/ml) followed by horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-coupled rabbit anti-mouse antibody ((Dako, Glostrup, Denmark) diluted 1:2000) and finally ∼20 min incubation with HRP substrate (0.0025% H2O2 and 0.33 mg/ml of o-phenylenediamine) (Dako). The reaction was stopped by addition of 1.3 m H2SO4, after which the reaction product was quantified by absorbance measurements at 490 nm with absorbance at 540 nm used for background subtraction. In between each incubation step, ELISA plates were washed three times in PBS with 1.7 mm Mg2+, 1.3 mm Ca2+, and 0.1% Tween 20. After the incubation step with secondary antibody three additional washes were performed with Milli-Q water. For deglycosylation studies, collagens type I, IV, and V were treated with TFMS (49Edge A.S. Biochem. J. 2003; 376: 339-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar), using a commercial protein deglycosylation kit (Sigma). TFMS treatment was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions and 200 μg of each collagen was treated. Immediately after treatment, collagens were diluted to 10 μg/ml in ELISA coating buffer (0.1 m Na2CO3, pH 9.8). In the mock treated samples, collagens were lyophilized and then redissolved in 10 mm acetic acid before being diluted to 10 μg/ml in ELISA coating buffer. Internalization assays with 125I-labeled ligands in mouse skin fibroblasts isolated from newborn uPARAP-deficient or wild type mice and MG63 cells were performed as previously described (29Engelholm L.H. List K. Netzel-Arnett S. Cukierman E. Mitola D.J. Aaronson H. Kj⊘ller L. Larsen J.K. Yamada K.M. Strickland D.K. Holmbeck K. Dan⊘ K. Birkedal-Hansen H. Behrendt N. Bugge T.H. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 160: 1009-1015Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). In brief, samples of 1 × 105 cells were seeded in 24-well tissue culture plates and cultured overnight. In experiments with function-blocking antibody (mAb 5f4 against uPARAP), 10 μg/ml of the antibody was added to MG63 cells 5 h after seeding. The next day, culture medium was removed and cells were washed with serum-free assay buffer (low glucose DMEM with sodium pyruvate for fibroblasts and minimum Eagle's medium for MG63 cells; both from Invitrogen) supplemented with 20 mm HEPES and 15 mg/ml of BSA. Subsequently, fresh assay medium was added, with the inclusion of either no inhibitor, 50 mm mannose, 50 mm GlcNAc, 50 mm α-Me-Gal, or 10 μg/ml of mAb 5f4. In addition, the cysteine protease inhibitor E64d (10 μm) was added to all samples to optimize lysosomal accumulation of internalized proteins (32Kj⊘ller L. Engelholm L.H. H⊘yer-Hansen M. Dan⊘ K.

https://openalex.org/W2024748163,"The Cas scaffolding proteins (NEDD9/HEF1/CAS-L, BCAR1/p130Cas, EFSSIN, and HEPL/CASS4) regulate cell migration, division and survival, and are often deregulated in cancer. High BCAR1 expression is linked to poor prognosis in breast cancer patients, while upregulation of NEDD9 contributes to the metastatic behavior of melanoma and glioblastoma cells. Our recent work knocking out the single Drosophila Cas protein, Dcas, identified a genetic interaction with E-cadherin. As E-cadherin is often downregulated during epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) prior to metastasis, if such an activity was conserved in mammals it might partially explain how Cas proteins promote aggressive tumor behavior. We here establish that Cas proteins negatively regulate E-cadherin expression in human mammary cells. Cas proteins do not affect E-cadherin transcription, but rather, BCAR1 and NEDD9 signal through SRC to promote E-cadherin removal from the cell membrane and lysosomal degradation. We also find mammary tumors arising in MMTV-polyoma virus T-antigen mice have enhanced junctional E-cadherin in a Nedd9−/− background. Cumulatively, these results suggest a new role for Cas proteins in cell-cell adhesion signaling in cancer."

This study assessed current prevalence rates of mental disorders and levels of dysfunction among young adults who had lost their father due to war-related violence in childhood or adolescence.179 bereaved young adults and 175 non-bereaved young adults were interviewed a decade after experiencing the war in Kosovo. Prevalence rates of Major Depressive Episode (MDE), anxiety, and substance use disorders, and current suicide risk were assessed using the Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview. The syndrome of Prolonged Grief Disorder (PGD) was assessed with the Prolonged Grief Disorder Interview (PG-13). Somatic symptoms were measured with the Patient Health Questionnaire. General health distress was assessed with the General Health Questionnaire.Bereaved participants were significantly more likely to suffer from either MDE or any anxiety disorder than non-bereaved participants (58.7% vs. 40%). Among bereaved participants, 39.7% met criteria for Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder, 34.6% for PGD, and 22.3% for MDE. Bereaved participants with PGD were more likely to suffer from MDE, any anxiety disorder, or current suicide risk than bereaved participants without PGD. Furthermore, these participants reported significantly greater physical distress than bereaved participants without PGD.War-related loss during middle childhood and adolescence presents significant risk for adverse mental health and dysfunction in young adulthood in addition to exposure to other war-related traumatic events. Furthermore, the syndrome of PGD can help to identify those with the greatest degree of distress and dysfunction."
https://openalex.org/W1978827416,"The ladybird beetle, Coleomegilla maculata (DeGeer), is a common and abundant predator in many cropping systems. Its larvae and adults are predaceous, feeding on aphids, thrips, lepidopteran larvae and plant tissues, such as pollen. Therefore, this species is exposed to insecticidal proteins expressed in insect-resistant, genetically engineered cotton expressing Cry proteins derived from Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt). A tritrophic bioassay was conduced to evaluate the potential impact of Cry2Ab- and Cry1Ac-expressing cotton on fitness parameters of C. maculata using Bt-susceptible and -resistant larvae of Trichoplusia ni as prey. Coleomegilla maculata survival, development time, adult weight and fecundity were not different when they were fed with resistant T. ni larvae reared on either Bt or control cotton. To ensure that C. maculata were not sensitive to the tested Cry toxins independent from the plant background and to add certainty to the hazard assessment, C. maculata larvae were fed artificial diet incorporated with Cry2Ab, Cry1Ac or both at >10 times higher concentrations than in cotton tissue. Artificial diet containing E-64 was included as a positive control. No differences were detected in any life-table parameters between Cry protein-containing diet treatments and the control diet. In contrast, larvae of C. maculata fed the E-64 could not develop to the pupal stage and the 7-d larval weight was significantly negatively affected. In both feeding assays, the stability and bioactivity of Cry proteins in the food sources were confirmed by ELISA and sensitive-insect bioassays. Our results show that C. maculata is not affected by Bt cotton and is not sensitive to Cry2Ab and Cry1Ac at concentrations exceeding the levels in Bt cotton, thus demonstrating that Bt cotton will pose a negligible risk to C. maculata. More importantly, this study demonstrates a comprehensive system for assessing the risk of genetically modified plants on non-target organisms."

Diverse biofuels produced from biomass include cellulosic ethanol, butanol, fatty acid ethyl esters, methane, hydrogen, methanol, dimethyether, Fischer-Tropsch diesel, and bioelectricity; the respective powertrain systems include internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles, hybrid electric vehicles based on gasoline or diesel ICEs, hydrogen fuel cell vehicles, sugar fuel cell vehicles (SFCV), and battery electric vehicles (BEV).We conducted a simple, straightforward, and transparent biomass-to-wheel (BTW) analysis including three separate conversion elements--biomass-to-fuel conversion, fuel transport and distribution, and respective powertrain systems. BTW efficiency is a ratio of the kinetic energy of an automobile's wheels to the chemical energy of delivered biomass just before entering biorefineries. Up to 13 scenarios were analyzed and compared to a base line case--corn ethanol/ICE. This analysis suggests that BEV, whose electricity is generated from stationary fuel cells, and SFCV, based on a hydrogen fuel cell vehicle with an on-board sugar-to-hydrogen bioreformer, would have the highest BTW efficiencies, nearly four times that of ethanol-ICE.In the long term, a small fraction of the annual US biomass (e.g., 7.1%, or 700 million tons of biomass) would be sufficient to meet 100% of light-duty passenger vehicle fuel needs (i.e., 150 billion gallons of gasoline/ethanol per year), through up to four-fold enhanced BTW efficiencies by using SFCV or BEV. SFCV would have several advantages over BEV: much higher energy storage densities, faster refilling rates, better safety, and less environmental burdens."

We used two-dimensional DIGE proteomics as a discovery approach to identify key molecular changes taking place in a temporally controlled model of DCM triggered by cardiomyocyte-specific serum response factor (SRF) knock-out in mice. We identified muscle creatine kinase (MCK) as the primary down-regulated protein followed by α-actin and α-tropomyosin down-regulation leading to a decrease of polymerized F-actin. The early response to these defects was an increase in the amount of desmin intermediate filaments and phosphorylation of the αB-crystallin chaperone. We found that αB-crystallin and desmin progressively lose their striated pattern and accumulate at the intercalated disk and the sarcolemma, respectively. We further show that desmin is a preferential target of advanced glycation end products (AGE) in mouse and human DCM. Inhibition of CK in cultured cardiomyocytes is sufficient to recapitulate both the actin depolymerization defect and the modification of desmin by AGE. Treatment with either cytochalasin D or glyoxal, a cellular AGE, indicated that both actin depolymerization and AGE contribute to desmin disorganization. Heat shock-induced phosphorylation of αB-crystallin provides a transient protection of desmin against glyoxal in a p38 MAPK-dependent manner. Our results show that the strong down-regulation of MCK activity contributes to F-actin instability and induces post-translational modification of αB-crystallin and desmin.

The calculation of the absolute value of the barrier height has traditionally relied on the assumption of an attempt frequency, υ‡. Here we used single molecule force-clamp spectroscopy to directly determine the value of υ‡ for mechanical unfolding by measuring the unfolding rate of the small protein ubiquitin at varying temperatures. Our experiments demonstrate a significant effect of the temperature on the mechanical rate of unfolding.

https://openalex.org/W2164524451,"The trafficking of fatty acids across the membrane and into downstream metabolic pathways requires their activation to CoA thioesters. Members of the fatty acid transport protein/very long chain acyl-CoA synthetase (FATP/Acsvl) family are emerging as key players in the trafficking of exogenous fatty acids into the cell and in intracellular fatty acid homeostasis. We have expressed two naturally occurring splice variants of human FATP2 (Acsvl1) in yeast and 293T-REx cells and addressed their roles in fatty acid transport, activation, and intracellular trafficking. Although both forms (FATP2a (M(r) 70,000) and FATP2b (M(r) 65,000 and lacking exon3, which encodes part of the ATP binding site)) were functional in fatty acid import, only FATP2a had acyl-CoA synthetase activity, with an apparent preference toward very long chain fatty acids. To further address the roles of FATP2a or FATP2b in fatty acid uptake and activation, LC-MS/MS was used to separate and quantify different acyl-CoA species (C14-C24) and to monitor the trafficking of different classes of exogenous fatty acids into intracellular acyl-CoA pools in 293T-REx cells expressing either isoform. The use of stable isotopically labeled fatty acids demonstrated FATP2a is involved in the uptake and activation of exogenous fatty acids, with a preference toward n-3 fatty acids (C18:3 and C22:6). Using the same cells expressing FATP2a or FATP2b, electrospray ionization/MS was used to follow the trafficking of stable isotopically labeled n-3 fatty acids into phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylinositol. The expression of FATP2a resulted in the trafficking of C18:3-CoA and C22:6-CoA into both phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylinositol but with a distinct preference for phosphatidylinositol. Collectively these data demonstrate FATP2a functions in fatty acid transport and activation and provides specificity toward n-3 fatty acids in which the corresponding n-3 acyl-CoAs are preferentially trafficked into acyl-CoA pools destined for phosphatidylinositol incorporation."

Collectively, these findings emphasize that distinct GalNAc-T isoforms have specialized and unique functions. GalNAc-Ts are structurally composed of a catalytic domain and a lectin domain, which fold into an A type-fold and a β-trefoil-fold consisting of three subunits (α, β, and γ), respectively. Both domains are required for efficient glycosylation of mucin domains (22Fritz T.A. Hurley J.H. Trinh L.B. Shiloach J. Tabak L.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Two different modes by which GalNAc-Ts select glycosylation sites have been identified: (i) independent recognition of acceptor substrate peptide sequence (±3–5 residues of Ser/Thr sites) by the catalytic domain and (ii) concerted recognition of the acceptor substrate by the catalytic domain combined with binding to adjacent O-GalNAc sites by the lectin domain (24Wandall H.H.

Thus, the glycopeptide selectivity of GalNAc-Ts can be mediated by either the catalytic domain alone, as demonstrated by GalNAc-T10 that requires a GalNAc residue at position +1 adjacent to the threonine/serine to be glycosylated (30Perrine C.L.

In the present study, we investigated the fine binding specificities of lectin domains from GalNAc-T1, -T2, -T3, and -T4 to elucidate potential selective binding properties for the adjacent peptide sequence around GalNAc-glycosylated sites. We previously demonstrated that all lectins bound GalNAc, but the question of GalNAc-glycopeptide specificity has remained unanswered. With the introduction of glycopeptide microarrays (31Pedersen J.W. Blixt O. Bennett E.P. Tarp M.A. Dar I. Mandel U. Poulsen S.S. Pedersen A.E. Rasmussen S. Jess P. Clausen H. Wandall H.H. Int. J.

Using a large glycopeptide library based on the sequence of mucins MUC1, MUC2, MUC4, MUC5AC, MUC6, and MUC7 displayed on microarrays, we demonstrate that the lectin domains recognize differential subsets of small glycopeptides. This was further supported by an independent analysis of a random bead glycopeptide library probed with two lectins. The results underscore the complex and coordinated process by which the large polypeptide GalNAc-T enzyme family control protein O-glycosylation and provides evidence for a more differentiated role of the diverse sequences of the GalNAc-T lectins domains. pAcGP67 baculovirus expression constructs containing the soluble coding region of human GalNAc-T1, GalNAc-T2 wild-type, GalNAc-T2 with a mutation in the α-lectin subdomain (GalNAc-T2458H), GalNAc-T2 with a mutation in the DXD motif of the catalytic subdomain (GalNAc-T2224H), GalNAc-T3 wild-type, GalNAc-T3 with a mutation in the α-lectin subdomain (GalNAc-T3519H), GalNAc-T4 wild-type, and GalNAc-T4 with a mutation in the α-subdomain (GalNAc-T4459H) were prepared as described previously (14Kato K.

Briefly, His-tagged mucin fragments covering sequences in MUC2, MUC4, MUC5AC, MUC6, and MUC7 were produced in Escherichia coli and purified by nickel chromatography and HPLC. The mucins were in vitro glycosylated with GalNAc T1–T4 to Tn (GalNAcα-O), and further elongated with ST6GalNAc-I or β3GnT6 to create STn and Core3. The products were verified by MALDI-TOF and SDS-PAGE. Peptides were synthesized by Schafer-n, Peptides&elephants, and Sigma, in vitro glycosylated, and purified using SepPak Vac C18 columns (Waters).

Prior to use, the microarrays were blocked for 1 h with 50 mm ethanolamine in 50 mm sodium borate (pH 8.5). Purified recombinant GalNAc-Ts were incubated in a closed container overnight (16 h) at 4 °C or for 1 h at 37 °C, washed three times in PBS, followed by a 2-h incubation with monoclonal antibodies directed against GalNAc-T1 (UH3), GalNAc-T2 (UH4), GalNAc-T3 (UH5) (7Mandel U.

Mandel, unpublished data. The sample was then washed in PBS and incubated with biotinylated rabbit anti-mouse IgG (DAKO), followed by Cy3-conjugated streptavidin diluted in PBS with 0.05% Tween 20. Binding of catalytically active GalNAc-Ts was also tested using mAbs to the T7 tag or His tag with similar results for GalNAc-T2, -T3, and -T4. The assay, however, was more robust with GalNAc-T-specific mAbs and allowed the detection of GalNAc-Ts when bound to His/T7-tagged mucins. Binding was quantified by scanning with a ProScanArray HT Microarray Scanner (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and image analysis with ProScanArray Express 4.0 software (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Each spot was measured in four replicates and the mean relative fluorescence intensity used. Data were analyzed and plotted using Microsoft Excel or GraphPad Prism software. Inhibition studies were performed with Bn-α-GalNAc, Bn-α-GlcNAc (5 mm, respectively), or free GalNAc and GlcNAc (250 mm). In addition, inhibition was performed with selected peptides at a concentration of 0.1–1 mm. A combinatorial glycopeptide library was synthesized using biocompatible PEGA1900 resin (2 g, 24 ml, 0.24 mmol of NH2) (38Meldal M. Tetrahedron Lett. 1992; 33: 3077-3080Crossref Scopus (306) Google Scholar). The resin was carefully washed with N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) and distributed evenly into a multiple column (20 columns) library generator (39Meldal M. Methods. 1994; 6: 417-424Crossref Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The amino groups of the resin were derivatized with the 20 genetically encoded Fmoc-derivative (3 eq), N- [1H-benzotriazol-1-yl)-(dimethylamino)methylene]-N-methylmetanaminium tetrafluoroborate N-oxide (3 eq), and 4-methylmorpholine (3 eq) by pre-mixing the reagents in 10 ml of DMF 2 min prior to addition to the swelled resin. The resin was washed with DMF and the Fmoc group removed with 20% piperidine in DMF. A 11-mer peptide library assembly was created using coupling conditions (Fmoc-AA-OH, N-[1H-benzotriazol-1-yl)-(dimethylamino)methylene]-N-methylmetanaminium tetrafluoroborate N-oxide, 4-methylmorpholine, and DMF) and piperidine-mediated deprotection as described above. Between each coupling step, after Fmoc removal, the library generator was half-filled with DMF and tightly closed. It was turned upside down and the resin beads were thoroughly mixed by vigorous agitation of the synthesizer. The generator was turned upright and even redistribution of beads in the wells was controlled. At the sixth coupling of the combinatorial assembly, Fmoc-Ser(Ac4GalNAc)-OPfp (2 eq) was used, whereas five positions on either side comprised even amounts of the 20 encoded amino acids. The library was transferred to a fritted syringe and washed with DMF and water. Excess liquid was removed. The protecting groups were cleaved with 92% TFA containing ethane dithiol (1%), triisopropylsilane (2%), and water (5%) for 2.5 h and the resin was washed with water, DMF, 20% piperidine/DMF, DMF, water, and plenty of dry methanol in succession. The methanol-swelled resin was covered with NaOMe/methanol (0.1 m, 20 ml) for 30 min, washed, and the treatment repeated for 2 h. The deacetylated glycopeptide library was washed with methanol and water before use in screening. Test sequencing of single library beads using Edman degradation on an Abi-431 sequencer showed that the compounds were as expected and gave the expected sequence result. Purified lectin domains from GalNAc-T4 (GalNAc-T4lec) or -T2 (GalNAc-T2lec) were both reacted with Oregon Green succinimide ester (2.5 eq, Molecular Probes), and the labeled protein was purified using gel permeation chromatography. The above library was divided into two aliquots. An aliquot of 300,000 beads was incubated with labeled GalNAc-T4lec or GalNAc-T2lec. Each mixture was passed through an automated COMPAS bead sorter (Union Biometrica) and the active beads were removed. The inactive beads from each sorting were incubated with the other protein and positives were isolated. In this manner, selective T2 and T4 ligands were obtained. All labeled beads were subjected to amino acid sequencing (Table 2).TABLE 2Differential binding of glycopeptide beads by GalNAc-T2 and -T4 Open table in a new tab Products of O-glycosylation reactio"
https://openalex.org/W2165546671,"Mounting an immune response against pathogens incurs costs to organisms by its effects on important life-history traits, such as reproductive investment and survival. As shown recently, immune activation produces large amounts of reactive species and is suggested to induce oxidative stress. Sperm are highly susceptible to oxidative stress, which can negatively impact sperm function and ultimately male fertilizing efficiency. Here we address the question as to whether mounting an immune response affects sperm quality through the damaging effects of oxidative stress. It has been demonstrated recently in birds that carotenoid-based ornaments can be reliable signals of a male's ability to protect sperm from oxidative damage. In a full-factorial design, we immune-challenged great tit males while simultaneously increasing their vitamin E availability, and assessed the effect on sperm quality and oxidative damage. We conducted this experiment in a natural population and tested the males' response to the experimental treatment in relation to their carotenoid-based breast coloration, a condition-dependent trait. Immune activation induced a steeper decline in sperm swimming velocity, thus highlighting the potential costs of an induced immune response on sperm competitive ability and fertilizing efficiency. We found sperm oxidative damage to be negatively correlated with sperm swimming velocity. However, blood resistance to a free-radical attack (a measure of somatic antioxidant capacity) as well as plasma and sperm levels of oxidative damage (lipid peroxidation) remained unaffected, thus suggesting that the observed effect did not arise through oxidative stress. Towards the end of their breeding cycle, swimming velocity of sperm of more intensely colored males was higher, which has important implications for the evolution of mate choice and multiple mating in females because females may accrue both direct and indirect benefits by mating with males having better quality sperm."
https://openalex.org/W1984981565,"Decreased mitochondrial function plays a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Recently, it was reported that mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) haplogroups confer genetic susceptibility to T2DM in Koreans and Japanese. Particularly, mtDNA haplogroup N9a is associated with a decreased risk of T2DM, whereas haplogroups D5 and F are associated with an increased risk. To examine functional consequences of these haplogroups without being confounded by the heterogeneous nuclear genomic backgrounds of different subjects, we constructed transmitochondrial cytoplasmic hybrid (cybrid) cells harboring each of the three haplogroups (N9a, D5, and F) in a background of a shared nuclear genome. We compared the functional consequences of the three haplogroups using cell-based assays and gene expression microarrays. Cell-based assays did not detect differences in mitochondrial functions among the haplogroups in terms of ATP generation, reactive oxygen species production, mitochondrial membrane potential, and cellular dehydrogenase activity. However, differential expression and clustering analyses of microarray data revealed that the three haplogroups exhibit a distinctive nuclear gene expression pattern that correlates with their susceptibility to T2DM. Pathway analysis of microarray data identified several differentially regulated metabolic pathways. Notably, compared to the T2DM-resistant haplogroup N9a, the T2DM-susceptible haplogroup F showed down-regulation of oxidative phosphorylation and up-regulation of glycolysis. These results suggest that variations in mtDNA can affect the expression of nuclear genes regulating mitochondrial functions or cellular energetics. Given that impaired mitochondrial function caused by T2DM-associated mtDNA haplogroups is compensated by the nuclear genome, we speculate that defective nuclear compensation, under certain circumstances, might lead to the development of T2DM."
https://openalex.org/W2023141724,"Cellular maintenance of protein homeostasis is essential for normal cellular function. The ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) plays a central role in processing cellular proteins destined for degradation, but little is currently known about how misfolded cytosolic proteins are recognized by protein quality control machinery and targeted to the UPS for degradation in mammalian cells. Destabilizing domains (DDs) are small protein domains that are unstable and degraded in the absence of ligand, but whose stability is rescued by binding to a high affinity cell-permeable ligand. In the work presented here, we investigate the biophysical properties and cellular fates of a panel of FKBP12 mutants displaying a range of stabilities when expressed in mammalian cells. Our findings correlate observed cellular instability to both the propensity of the protein domain to unfold in vitro and the extent of ubiquitination of the protein in the non-permissive (ligand-free) state. We propose a model in which removal of stabilizing ligand causes the DD to unfold and be rapidly ubiquitinated by the UPS for degradation at the proteasome. The conditional nature of DD stability allows a rapid and non-perturbing switch from stable protein to unstable UPS substrate unlike other methods currently used to interrogate protein quality control, providing tunable control of degradation rates.

With recent advances in genome sequencing, biologists now have a much clearer picture of the primary structures of predicted and known proteins for many organisms. Methods to query protein function, however, have lagged behind this sequencing revolution. We have developed several general methods to conditionally control protein stability in cells using small molecules (1Banaszynski L.A. Chen L.C. Maynard-Smith L.A. Ooi A.G. Wandless T.J.

Previous work by Banaszynski et al. (1Banaszynski L.A. Chen L.C. Maynard-Smith L.A. Ooi A.G. Wandless T.J. Cell. 2006; 126: 995-1004Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (614) Google Scholar) showed that blocking the proteasome prevents degradation of a FKBP-derived DD, and similar behavior is observed with E. coli dihydrofolate reductase-derived DDs (2Iwamoto M. Björklund T. Lundberg C. Kirik D. Wandless T.J. Chem. Biol. 2010; 17: 981-988Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). The proteasome is a complex multi-subunit protease responsible for degradation of most regulated proteins found in the cytoplasm and nucleus. Unstructured or oxidized proteins can be degraded directly by the proteasome (3Dunlop R.A. Brunk U.T. Rodgers K.J. IUBMB Life. 2009; 61: 522-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 4Yano M. Koumoto Y. Kanesaki Y. Wu X. Kido H. Biomacromolecules. 2004; 5: 1465-1469Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), and a few proteins are delivered to the proteasome via adapter proteins (5Janse D.M. Crosas B. Finley D. Church G.M.

U.S.A. 2005; 102: 14982-14987Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Most proteins, however, are targeted for proteasomal degradation through covalent modification with the small protein ubiquitin (7Schrader E.K. Harstad K.G. Matouschek A. Nat. Chem. Biol. 2009; 5: 815-822Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). Once a protein is monoubiquitinated, usually on a lysine side chain or the N terminus, the ubiquitin cascade can extend this tag to form polyubiquitin chains through conjugation to one of seven internal lysines in ubiquitin, with chains of four ubiquitin moieties being sufficient for proteasome targeting (8Behrends C. Harper J.W. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2011; 18: 520-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 9Thrower J.S. Hoffman L. Rechsteiner M. Pickart C.M. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 94-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (1309) Google Scholar). Post-translational modification with ubiquitin plays a role in a variety of cellular pathways, but one of the best studied is the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) (10Finley D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2009; 78: 477-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (1275) Google Scholar, 11Venancio T.M. Balaji S. Iyer L.M. Aravind L. Genome Biol. 2009; 10: R33Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The UPS network of proteins works in concert to tag substrates with polyubiquitin chains, which, in turn, target substrates to the proteasome for degradation. In addition to targeting regulated proteins in response to cellular signals such as cell cycle progression or nutrient availability, the UPS also modifies misfolded proteins (12Kaganovich D. Kopito R. Frydman J. Nature. 2008; 454: 1088-1095Crossref PubMed Scopus (690) Google Scholar). Despite a large body of work into proteasome recognition of polyubiquitin chains, there remain many unanswered questions about substrate selection within the UPS. Few E3s have known substrate requirements (13Su L. Lineberry N. Huh Y. Soares L. Fathman C.G. J. Immunol. 2006; 177: 7559-7566Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Misfolded proteins can arise from gene mutation, errors in nascent protein translation, folding, localization, or oxidative damage to existing proteins. The protein quality control (PQC) machinery must detect and remove misfolded proteins to maintain cellular homeostasis. Separate PQC branches have been identified in the endoplasmic reticulum (14Hirsch C. Gauss R. Horn S.C. Neuber O. Sommer T. Nature. 2009; 458: 453-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar), in the nucleus (15Rosenbaum J.C. Fredrickson E.K. Oeser M.L. Garrett-Engele C.M. Locke M.N. Richardson L.A. Nelson Z.W.

However, little is known about the cytosolic PQC pathway in mammalian cells and how it passes substrates to the UPS for degradation, despite identification of a proteins like CHIP (carboxyl terminus of Hsc70-interacting protein), which are capable of binding chaperones and UPS machinery (19Bengtson M.H. Joazeiro C.A.P. Nature. 2010; 467: 470-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar, 20Ballinger C.A. Connell P. Wu Y. Hu Z. Thompson L.J. Yin L.Y. Patterson C. Mol. Cell.

A better understanding of the mechanisms by which proteins recognize PQC substrates and connect to the UPS would be a significant advance in our understanding of protein homeostasis. Our original screens identified dozens of FKBP mutants that display ligand-dependent stability when expressed in mammalian cells (1Banaszynski L.A. Chen L.C. Maynard-Smith L.A. Ooi A.G. Wandless T.J. Cell. 2006; 126: 995-1004Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (614) Google Scholar, 49Maynard-Smith L.A. Chen L.C. Banaszynski L.A. Ooi A.G. Wandless T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 24866-24872Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). In the work presented here, we examine a subset of these FKBP-derived DDs to study the biophysical behavior of these purified proteins in vitro as well as the intracellular stability of the same DDs when expressed in mammalian cells. The cell-free experiments reveal that the Shield-1 ligand stabilizes the DD protein fold, whereas the DDs appear to be misfolded or rapidly sampling unfolded states in the absence of ligand. When the DDs are expressed in mammalian cells, our studies demonstrate that the withdrawal of ligand causes the DDs to be modified by the UPS before degradation at the proteasome. In the absence of Shield-1, DD recognition by the UPS is rapid, with significant ubiquitination observed within minutes after ligand removal. Recognition is also context-dependent, as DDs stabilized by ligand are not ubiquitinated. Biophysical measures of protein instability for purified proteins correlate well with the extent of ubiquitination and observed cellular stability of DDs expressed in mammalian cells. Identification of the FKBP-derived DDs as substrates of the UPS elucidates both the pathway for DD degradation and suggests that DDs would make excellent model substrates to further probe the molecular mechanisms responsible for recognizing and degrading misfolded cellular proteins. MG132 powder was purchased from Cayman Chemical and stored as a 10 mm stock in ethanol at −20 °C. Ammonium chloride (15N, 99%) and deuterium oxide (99%) were purchased from Cambridge Isotope Laboratories; isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactoside and tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine hydrocloride (TCEP) were purchased from Gold Biotechnology; chloroquine, hexadimethrine bromide (polybrene), and N-ethylmalimide were purchased from Sigma. The antibodies used in this study were anti-GFP (JL-8, Clontech) and anti-α-tubulin (Sigma). Ubiquitin-associated domain (UBA) resin and purified Usp2cc were kindly provided by the R. R. Kopito laboratory (Stanford University). FKBP-derived DD mutants carrying the F36V mutation alone or in combination with L106P, L106A, or V4A/I7V were cloned into pBMN vectors as N-terminal fusions to either YFP or SuperFolder GFP (sfGFP, Sandia BioTech). For expression in bacteria, DD mutants and wild-type FKBP were cloned into a pET15b vector encoding the construct hexahistidine tag-tobacco etch virus cleavage site (ENLYFQG)-GGGS linker-FKBP. NIH 3T3 and HeLa S3 (ATCC CCL-2.2) cell lines were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated donor bovine serum, 2 mm glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (all from Invitrogen) and cultured at 37 °C. Stable lines were created using the Phoenix packaging cell lines (ecotropic for NIH 3T3; amphotropic for HeLa S3) transfected with TransIT-LT1 (Mirus) using the manufacturer's suggested protocol. Viral supernatants were harvested 48 h post-transfection, filtered (0.45 μm, Fisher), and supplemented with 4 μg/ml polybrene. Cells were incubated with viral supernatant for 5 h at 37 °C, cultured in growth medium 48 h to allow viral integration, and then assayed for fluorescence or drug selected with blasticidin (10 μg/ml, Invitrogen) or puromycin (2.5 μg/ml, Invitrogen). For Shield-1 washout experiments, adherent cells had Shield-1 medium replaced with growth medium “conditioned” with 5 μm bacterially expressed F36V protein. Cells were either incubated with conditioned medium continuously or for 5 min at 37 °C before replacement with regular growth medium. For suspension cells, cells were harvested by centrifugation at 1,000 rpm for 5 min between each change of medium. For expression of F36V and wild-type FKBP, pET15b protein expression constructs were transformed into BL21(DE3) cells. Cells were grown in Luria-Bertani medium (LB (22Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, New York1989: A.1-A.3Google Scholar)) at 37 °C to an optical density at 600 nm of 0.5–0.7. Protein expression was induced with 2 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactoside at 37 °C for 5 h, after which cells were collected by centrifugation at 5,000 rpm at 4 °C for 20 min. For expression of mutants L106P, L106A, and V4A/I7V, pET15b protein expression constructs were co-transformed with the chaperone plasmid pG-Tf2 (Takara) into BL21(DE3) cells. Cells were grown in LB with 20 ng/ml tetracycline at 37 °C to an optical density at 600 nm of 0.5–0.7. Protein expression was induced with 2 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactoside at 37 °C for 5 h, after which cells were collected by centrifugation at 5,000 rpm at 4 °C for 20 min. For NMR experiments, M9 minimal media (22Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, New York1989: A.1-A.3Google Scholar) containing 1 g/liter 15NH4Cl was substituted for LB to make uniformly 15N-labeled protein. Hexahistidine-tagged protein was purified on PerfectPro nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose resin (5 PRIME) according to manufacturer's instructions. For conditioned media, purification was halted here, and protein was dialyzed into PBS with 4% glycerol. For NMR and urea experiments, protein was incubated with MHTΔ238 tobacco etch virus protease (23Blommel P.G. Fox B.G. Protein Expr. Purif. 2007; 55: 53-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar) in cleavage buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, 0.5 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, pH 8) at 30 °C for 4 h or overnight at a ratio of 1:10 mg tobacco etch virus:mg of substrate. The reaction was incubated with regenerated nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid resin, this time collecting the flow-through and first wash. 15N-labeled protein was dialyzed in Slide-A-lyzer cassettes (3,500 MWKO, Pierce) into NMR buffer (50 mm KH2PO4, 100 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm EDTA, 1 mm TCEP, 2% glycerol) and supplemented to 10% deuterium oxide. Wild-type FKBP was prepared in NMR buffer pH = 5.0, 5.6, 6.2, 6.8, and 7.4. FKBP-derived DDs were prepared in NMR buffer, pH 6.8, as this was the compromise between physiological conditions and hydrogen exchange rates. All NMR experiments were acquired at the Stanford Magnetic Resonance Laboratory. [1H,15N]-HSQC spectra were acquired at 27 °C on Varian Inova 600 and 800 MHz spectrometers running VNMR v6.1C and VNMRJ 2.1B, respectively, both equipped with 5-mm inverse detect, triple-resonance 1H{13C,15N} pulse-field gradient probes. The majority of HSQC spectra were acquired on the 600 instrument and used 8395 Hz (1H) and 2431 Hz (15N) spectral widths, centered at 120 ppm in the 15N dimension, 1024 data points in t2, 64 complex t1 points, and a 1-s pre-scan (d1) delay. Spectra were 10 min to 10 h long (4 to 256 transients per t1 increment) depending on sample protein concentrations. Two HSQC spectra were acquired on the 800 instrument and used 9612 Hz (1H) and 3242 Hz (15N) spectral widths, centered at 120 ppm in the 15N dimension, 1024 data points in t2, 32 complex t1 points, and 1-s pre-scan (d1) delay. Spectra were 2.5–5-h-long (128 to 256 transients per t1 increment), again depending on sample protein concentrations. All HSQC data were processed on the spectrometers and then analyzed with SPARKY (24Deleted in proof.Google Scholar). 5T. D. Goddard and D. G.

Protein was purified further by size exclusion chromatography in SEC buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm TCEP, pH 7.5) on a HiPrep 26/60 Sephacryl S-100 HR column (GE Healthcare) using an Akta Explorer FPLC system. Fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE, and fractions containing protein were pooled and concentrated (10,000 MWCO, Amicon). For each FKBP mutant, 2 μm protein was incubated with 1 mm DTT and 10 μm Shield-1 or an equal volume of ethanol at 4 °C overnight. Gravimetrically measured 10.22 m urea stock was added to a final range from 0 to 6 m for FKBP mutants, or 0 to 7 m urea for wild-type FKBP12, with each series containing 40 samples buffered to 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and incubated at room temperature overnight. A SPEX 1680 Double Spectrometer (Horiba Scientific) was used with a band pass of 10 nm, an excitation wavelength of 290 nm, and a recorded emission range of 300–380 nm. Fraction unfolded was calculated according to Equation 1, where ratio(320/356) is the ratio of emission values at 320 nm (native) and 356 nm (unfolded), and FN and FU are the values for the completely native and unfolded fractions in the pre- and postdenaturational regions, respectively.

Cell pellets were washed with PBS and lysed on ice with cold lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.25% sodium deoxycholate, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.5) containing protease inhibitor (Sigma) and 10 mm N-ethylmalimide. After incubating on ice 30 min, lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 13,300 rpm at 4 °C for 20 min. Proteins were quantified by Bradford protein assay (Bio-Rad) and resolved using SDS-PAGE. UBA resin was washed in 2 bed volumes of binding buffer (10 mm HEPES, 20 mm imidazole, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% Triton X-100, pH 7.4) and centrifuged at 4000 rpm for 1 min. UBA resin was resuspended in binding buffer to make a 50% slurry. One milligram of whole cell lysate was diluted with binding buffer to a final volume of 150 μl and incubated with 50 μl of 50% UBA slurry with end-over-end mixing at 4 °C overnight. Resin was washed twice with 1 ml of binding buffer and once with PBS. Protein was eluted off the resin by boiling in 2× SDS loading buffer at 100 °C for 10 min. Supernatant was resolved by SDS-PAGE. For Usp2cc control experiments, 1 mg of lysate was treated with 20 mm DTT at 4 °C for 5 min to neutralize N-ethylmalimide in the lysis buffer. Lysate was incubated with 5 μg of purified Usp2cc at 37 °C for 1 h before proceeding with addition of UBA resin. Previous work used FACS based flow cytometry screens to isolate mutants of FKBP that display ligand-dependent stability when expressed in mammalian cells (1Banaszynski L.A. Chen L.C.

All mutants responded to addition of Shield-1 with increased stability, and we were interested in investigating how protein structural changes correlated with the observed function in cells. For the work presented here, we used four FKBP mutants that exhibit different levels of stability when expressed in cells in the absence of ligand (i.e. basal stability) (Fig. 1B). Shield-1 possesses a synthetic “bump” to prevent its binding to the endogenous wild-type FKBP12. All of the FKBP mutants described herein encode the cavity-forming F36V mutation that accommodates this engineered bump. Thus, Shield-1 binds ∼1000-fold more tightly to proteins possessing the F36V mutation (26Clackson T. Yang W. Rozamus L.W. Hatada M. Amara J.F. Rollins C.T. Stevenson L.F. Magari S.R. Wood S.A. Courage N.L. Lu X. Cerasoli Jr., F. Gilman M. Holt D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1998; 95: 10437-10442Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar). Parental F36V is the most stable mutant, showing significant expression over background in the absence of Shield-1 and a modest rise in levels, as expected, upon addition of ligand. The L106P mutant is the least stable DD, although the V4A/I7V mutant also shows very low basal levels in the absence of stabilizing ligand. The L106A mutant displays an intermediate phenotype with basal levels significantly above background, but it remains robustly responsive to the addition of Shield-1. Although it is a poor candidate to use as a DD to regulate protein of interest levels, we used the L106A mutant to allow us to see trends in biophysical measurements and recognition by UPS machinery. To look at the effect of Shield-1 binding on the structure of different DD mutants, we bacterially expressed all DD mutants and wild-type FKBP12 with a cleavable affinity tag in 15N-labeled medium. The fully assigned two-dimensional HSQC NMR spectrum has been published for wild-type FKBP12, which facilitated mapping chemical shifts of residues across the DDs (27Rosen M.K. Michnick S.W. Karplus M. Schreiber S.L. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 4774-4789Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Rather than seeing strongly resolved above noise and well dispersed peaks reminiscent of a stably folded protein, the spectrum for L106P in the absence of Shield-1 resembles an unfolded or aggregated protein (Fig. 2A). Spectra display weak signal-to-noise ratios relative to other samples of similar concentration, and cross-peaks are not well dispersed. Spectra of the V4A/I7V mutant show better signal-to-noise levels, and resonances are reasonably well dispersed with one area of clustered cross-peaks (Fig. 2B). Spectra for F36V and L106A mutants both provide resonances with strong signal-to-noise ratios and well resolved cross-peaks in both dimensions, similar to the pattern observed for the well folded wild-type FKBP12 (Fig. 2, C and D; supplemental Fig. S3B). Incubating each protein sample with one molar equivalent of Shield-1 alters the spectra of all mutants so that the spectra converge to produce similar patterns of cross-peaks representative of the folded DD·Shield-1 complex (Fig. 2; supplemental Fig. S3A). Thus, each DD mutant, although providing HSQC spectra characteristic of various states of folding, is fully competent to bind Shield-1. In this manner, Shield-1 may act as a chemical chaperone that captures the stable, folded conformation of each DD mutant as the ligand-free proteins sample poorly folded or unfolded states in a dynamic equilibrium. To support the NMR analyses, we used tryptophan fluorescence to monitor protein unfolding in the absence or presence of Shield-1 over a range of urea concentrations. FKBP12 has a single tryptophan (Trp-59), which can be used to spectrophotometrically report on the hydrophobic (folded) or hydrophilic (unfolded) state of the protein. Wild-type FKBP12 and a number of its mutants have been shown to unfold according to a two-state model wherein molecules unfold without intermediate folding states (25Main E.R. Fulton K.F. Jackson S.E. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 6145-6153Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 28Fulton K.F. Main E.R. Daggett V. Jackson S.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 291: 445-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 29Main E.R. Fulton K.F. Jackson S.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 291: 429-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). For these experiments, we subjected bacterially expressed protein to an additional purification step using size exclusion chromatography to remove any low concentration impurities. Protein samples were incubated with either excess Shield-1 or vehicle overnight before samples were exposed to various concentrations of urea, also overnight. Without ligand, the L106P mutant is almost entirely unfolded; even in the absence of urea (Fig. 3A). The V4A/I7V mutant also shows a significant fraction of unfolded protein in the absence of urea, but it appears to be slightly more stable than the L106P mutant. The L106A mutant appears folded in the absence of urea but unfolds with the addition of low levels of urea; and the F36V mutant, the most stable domain when expressed in cells, requires the highest concentration of urea to unfold. Incubation with Shield-1 prior to exposure to urea significantly stabilizes the proteins and increases the concentration of urea necessary to unfold all mutants (Fig. 3B). All curves show a sharp transition between folded and unfolded states, indicating a lack of folding intermediates and allowing the data to be fit with a sigmoidal curve according to a two-state unfolding model. Separately, samples were diluted from high urea concentrations to a low concentration of urea to verify unfolded protein was able to refold (data not shown). These measurements support the more qualitative NMR study findings that very unstable DD mutants are partially to fully unfolded in the absence of ligand and that stabilization with Shield-1 causes the protein domains to adopt more stable folds. These biophysical experiments correlate well with the behavior of the respective DD mutants when expressed in cells (Fig. 1B). The mutants that are stable or only weakly destabilizing when expressed in cells appear relatively well folded in vitro. Likewise, mutants that strongly confer instability to fusion proteins when expressed in cells appear to be unfolded or in dynamic equilibrium between folded and unfolded states when characterized in vitro. Preliminary evidence showed that degradation of the L106P mutant is hindered by inhibition of the proteasome with MG132 or lactacystin (1Banaszynski L.A. Chen L.C. Maynard-Smith L.A. Ooi A.G. Wandless T.J. Cell. 2006; 126: 995-1004Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (614) Google Scholar). To pursue this matter further, we tested whether other protein degradation pathways could also function as routes for DD degradation. To study the effect of blocking the proteasomal or lysosomal pathways on the DD mutants, NIH 3T3 cell lines stably expressing DD-YFP-HA fusions were pretreated with 1 μm Shield-1 for 24 h to allow fusion proteins to reach maximum stabilization levels. We then removed the Shield-1-containing medium and replaced it with medium conditioned with bacterially expressed purified F36V to quickly and efficiently remove ligand from the cells (supplemental Fig. S5). After using this conditioned medium to wash out Shield-1, cells were incubated with 10 μm MG132, 100 μm chloroquine, or vehicle in the presence or absence of Shield-1. After 6 h, cells were collected, and lysates were resolved by SDS-PAGE and blotted for expression of YFP. Proteasome inhibitors, but not lysosome inhibitors, attenuate the degradation of DDs when Shield-1 is withdrawn (Fig. 4A). This finding suggests that the proteasome is the primary site of DD degradation, which is consistent with the view that the proteasome is the destination for most regulated protein turnover, whereas the lysosome is mainly responsible for bulk turnover of cytosol, organelles, and protein aggregates (17Bukau B.

To test whether the DDs are targeted to the proteasome via the UPS pathway, we utilized the UBA protein domain from human ubiquitin 2 conjugated to resin to probe for ubiquitin modifications (31Bennett E.J.

This study aimed to theoretically and experimentally demonstrate whether these observed L/R and N(area) are explained as optimal biomass allocation that maximize whole-plant relative growth rate (RGR). We developed a model which predicts optimal L/R and N(area) in response to nitrogen and light availability. In the model, net assimilation rate (NAR) was determined by light-photosynthesis curve, light availability measured during experiments, and leaf temperature affecting the photosynthesis and leaf dark respiration rate in high and low-light environments. Two pioneer trees, Morus bombycis and Acer buergerianum, were grown in various light and nitrogen availabilities in an experimental garden and used for parameterizing and testing the model predictions. They were grouped into four treatment groups (relative photosynthetic photon flux density, RPPFD 100% or 10%×nitrogen-rich or nitrogen-poor conditions) and grown in an experimental garden for 60 to 100 days. The model predicted that optimal L/R is higher and N(area) is lower in low-light than high-light environments when compared in the same soil nitrogen availability. Observed L/R and N(area) of the two pioneer trees were close to the predicted optimums. From the model predictions and pot experiments, we conclude that the pioneer trees, M. bombycis and A. buergerianum, regulated L/R and N(area) to maximize RGR in response to nitrogen and light availability."

Here, we examined the oxidation state of E1E2 heterodimers incorporated into retroviral pseudotyped particles (HCVpp) and investigated the significance of free sulfhydryl groups in cell culture-derived HCV (HCVcc) and HCVpp entry. Alkylation of free sulfhydryl groups on HCVcc/pp with a membrane-impermeable sulfhydryl-alkylating reagent 4-(N-maleimido)benzyl-α-trimethylammonium iodide (M135) prior to virus attachment to cells abolished infectivity in a dose-dependent manner. Labeling of HCVpp envelope proteins with EZ-Link maleimide-PEG2-biotin (maleimide-biotin) detected free thiol groups in both E1 and E2. Unlike retroviruses that employ disulfide reduction to facilitate virus entry, the infectivity of alkylated HCVcc could not be rescued by addition of exogenous reducing agents. Furthermore, the infectivity of HCVcc bound to target cells was not affected by addition of M135 indicative of a change in glycoprotein oxidation state from reduced to oxidized following virus attachment to cells. By contrast, HCVpp entry was reduced by 61% when treated with M135 immediately following attachment to cells, suggesting that the two model systems might demonstrate variations in oxidation kinetics. Glycoprotein oxidation was not altered following binding of HCVpp incorporated E1E2 to soluble heparin or recombinant CD81.

An obligate stage of viral entry for enveloped viruses is the process of membrane fusion between the viral membrane and a target cell membrane. This event is required to deliver the viral nucleocapsid into target cells for the initiation of productive infection. Membrane fusion is mediated by viral fusion proteins present on the surface of enveloped viruses that are characterized by the presence of at least two hydrophobic sequences, including a fusion peptide and a transmembrane domain. Fusion proteins are initially expressed as inactive precursors that remain trapped in a metastable conformation, shielding the fusion peptide from the external environment. A specific biochemical trigger activates the glycoprotein complex such that the fusion peptide is exposed and inserted into the target cell membrane, initiating the fusion reaction. Activation triggers include low pH (1Skehel J.J. Wiley D.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 531-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (2240) Google Scholar), receptor binding and low pH (2Mothes W. Boerger A.L.

Following insertion of the fusion peptide into the target cell membrane, the fusion protein refolds into a lower energy conformation, thereby drawing the viral and cellular membranes together. Fusion then proceeds through three distinct phases: lipid mixing, pore formation, and pore expansion (6Weissenhorn W. Hinz A. Gaudin Y.

The N-terminal region of E2 (residues 384–661) can be expressed independently of the polyprotein and folds into a structure capable of binding cellular receptors. This region is referred to as the receptor-binding domain (13Pileri P. Uematsu Y. Campagnoli S. Galli G. Falugi F. Petracca R. Weiner A.J. Houghton M. Rosa D. Grandi G. Abrignani S.

The receptor-binding domain is connected to the transmembrane domain via a hydrophobic heptad repeat (residues 675–699), which is essential for E1E2 heterodimerization and infectivity (15Drummer H.E.

In this study, we investigated whether the redox state of E1 and E2 is an essential factor in regulating virus entry. We show here that entry of cell culture-derived HCV (HCVcc) and retroviral pseudotypes incorporating E1E2 (HCVpp) is dependent on the presence of free thiol groups and that HCV glycoproteins are likely to switch from a reduced to an oxidized state following cellular attachment. Construction of pE1E2H77c has been described previously (7Drummer H.E. Maerz A. Poumbourios P. FEBS Lett. 2003; 546: 385-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). pNL4–3.

Human embryonic kidney cells (HEK 293T) were maintained in Dulbecco's modified eagle medium (DMEM) (Invitrogen) with 10% fetal calf serum and 2 mm l-glutamine (DMF10). Human hepatoma-7.5 (Huh7.5) cells were a kind gift of Professor Charles Rice (The Rockefeller University) and were maintained in DMF10 supplemented with 0.1 mm nonessential amino acids (DMF10NEA). HCV RNA was transcribed in vitro from XbaI-linearized pJC1FLAG2(p7-NS-GLUC2A) DNA using AmpliscribeTM T7 High Yield Transcription Kit (Epicenter Biotechnologies). RNA was purified, either by standard phenol/chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation, or using the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen). Purified RNA was stored at −80 °C. Huh7.5 cells were seeded at 350,000 cells/well in six-well plates 18 h prior to transfection in antibiotic-free DMF10NEA. Cells were transfected with 6 μg of RNA using 8 μl of DMRIE-C reagent (Invitrogen) in Opti-MEM (Invitrogen). Fresh Opti-MEM was added to cells 4 h post-transfection. Seventy-two h later, virus in the tissue culture supernatant was filtered (0.45 μm) and buffer-exchanged via ultrafiltration (100 kDa molecular weight cut-off; Amicon) into TN-Ca2+ (14 mm Tris, 12 mm HEPES, 150 mm NaCl, 1.8 mm Ca2+, pH 6.8). Virus was stored at −80 °C until further use. The TCID50/ml was determined according to the method of Lindenbach et al. (43Lindenbach B.D. Evans M.J. Syder A.J. Wölk B. Tellinghuisen T.L. Liu C.C. Maruyama T. Hynes R.O. Burton D.R. McKeating J.A. Rice C.M. Science. 2005; 309: 623-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (1962) Google Scholar) using the Reed-Muench calculator (44Reed L.J. Muench H.A. Am. J. Hyg. 1938; 27: 493-497Google Scholar). Huh7.5 cells were seeded at 30,000 cells/well in a 48-well plate format. Buffer-exchanged HCVcc was diluted to 1210 TCID50/ml in TN-Ca2+ and then alkylated with 0 to 1 mm 4-(N-maleimido)benzyl-α-trimethylammonium iodide (M135) at 37 °C for 50 min. Reactions were quenched by addition of DMF20NEA. Alkylated virus was incubated with cells at 37 °C for 2 h. Cells were washed once with TN-Ca2+, and fresh DMF10NEA was added to each well. Luciferase activity in the tissue culture supernatant was assayed 72 h later using the Renilla luciferase kit (Promega) and quantified on a Fluostar Optima fitted with luminescence optics (BMG LABTECH). Alternatively, 1210 TCID50/ml of HCVcc in TN-Ca2+ was incubated with cells at 4 °C for 2 h, followed by removal of unbound virus and addition of 0–5 mm M135 in TN-Ca2+ at 37 °C for 50 min. Rates of infection were measured 72 h later as described above. In assays where DTT was added to alkylated virus, 1210 TCID50/ml of HCVcc in TN-Ca2+ was incubated with M135 for 50 min at 37 °C and then added to cells for 2 h at 4 °C. DTT in TN-Ca2+ was then added to virus-bound cells for 1 h at 37 °C. To test M135 toxicity, Huh7.5 cells were directly incubated with 0 to 5 mm M135 for 2 h at 37 °C. Cells were washed and fresh DMF10NEA was added. Seventy-two h later, cell viability was determined by trypan blue staining. HEK 293T cells were seeded at 350,000 cells/well in a six-well plate. Eighteen h later, cells were co-transfected with pE1E2H77c or pHEF-VSVG along with pNL4–3. LUC.R−E− using FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science). Seventy-two h post-transfection, culture supernatants were filtered (0.45 μm). Particles were pelleted by ultracentrifugation (SW 41 rotor, 16,000 rpm, 4 °C, 2 h) and then resuspended in TN-Ca2+. Particles were alkylated with 0 to 5 mm M135 pre- or post-binding to Huh7.5 cells as described for HCVcc. Infection of Huh7.5 cells was determined 72 h later by luciferase activity in the cell lysate. The expression and purification of a chimera composed of maltose-binding protein linked to CD81 large extracellular loop (residues 113–201) (MBP-LEL(113–201)) has been described previously (45Drummer H.E. Wilson K.A. Poumbourios P. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 11143-11147Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Solid phase CD81 binding assays using HCVpp were performed as described previously (18Drummer H.E. Boo I. Maerz A.L. Poumbourios P. J. Virol. 2006; 80: 7844-7853Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Partially purified HCVpp were either untreated or alkylated with 5 mm M135 for 30 min then quenched with 500 mm cysteine for 30 min at room temperature. Virions were pelleted for 2 h at 14,000 × g and lysed in PBS containing 1% Triton X-100 and 1 mm EDTA. One quarter of the lysate was run directly in reducing SDS-PAGE, whereas the remaining lysate was diluted into heparin binding buffer (0.15 m NaCl, 0.02 m Tris/HCl (pH 7.4)) and added to heparin-Sepharose (Sigma) overnight at 4 °C (46Zahn A. Allain J.P. J. Gen. Virol. 2005; 86: 677-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Beads were washed three times in binding buffer and subjected to reducing SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. HEK 293T cells were seeded at 500,000 cells/well in a six-well plate. Five h later, cells were co-transfected with pE1E2H77c or cDNA4 empty vector along with pNL4–3. LUC.R−E− using FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science). Seventy-two h post-transfection, culture supernatants were filtered (0.45 μm). HCVpp were pelleted by ultracentrifugation (SW 41 rotor, 25,000 rpm, 4 °C, 2 h) over a 25% sucrose cushion. Pelleted particles were resuspended in PBS (pH 7.2) containing 1.25 mm EZ-Link maleimide-PEG2-biotin (maleimide-biotin; Thermo Scientific) or Sulfo-NHS-LC-Biotin (NHS-biotin; Thermo Scientific) and incubated at room temperature for 30 min. Reactions were quenched with 100 mm cysteine or glycine, respectively, for 30 min at room temperature. Particles were pelleted by centrifugation (14,000 × g, 2 h, 4 °C) and then lysed (0.6 m PBS, 1 mm EDTA, 0.02% sodium azide, 1% Triton X-100). Particle lysates were reduced with 100 mm DTT. High capacity streptavadin-agarose resin (Thermo Scientific) was used to isolate biotinylated proteins. Samples were run on reducing SDS-PAGE and Western blotted with mAbs directed toward E2, E1, and HIV-1 capsid protein p24 (H52, A4, and 183, respectively). For samples preincubated with M135, HCVpp were pelleted by ultracentrifugation, then resuspended in 0 to 1 mm M135 and incubated for 30 min at room temperature prior to biotinylation as described above. In maleimide biotinylation assays where HCVpp were prebound to CD81 or heparin, 500 μg of wild type or F186S mutant MBP-LEL(113–201), or 1 mg/ml heparin sodium salt (from porcine intestinal mucosa) were added to particles and incubated at room temperature for 1 h prior to ultracentrifugation and labeling as described above. Samples were run on 10% SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions and transferred onto nitrocellulose membrane (0.22 μ; Amersham Biosciences, GE Healthcare). E1, E2, and HIV-1 proteins p24 or Pr55Gag were visualized by mAbs A4, H52, and 183, respectively, and Alexa Fluor 680 goat anti-mouse (Invitrogen). Blots were imaged using an Odyssey Infrared Imaging System at 680 nm (LI-COR Biosciences). To investigate whether the redox state of the viral E1E2 complex is a determinant of infectivity, we examined the effects of treating HCVcc and HCVpp with the membrane impermeable sulfhydryl akylating agent M135. Infectious HCVcc were produced by transfection of Huh7.5 cells with RNA transcribed from the full-length chimeric HCV genomic construct JC1FLAG2(p7-NS-GLUC2A) (38Marukian S. Jones C.T. Andrus L. Evans M.J. Ritola K.D. Charles E.D. Rice C.M. Dustin L.B. Hepatology. 2008; 48: 1843-1850Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). Supernatants containing cell-free HCVcc were exchanged into TN-Ca2+ buffer by ultrafiltration to remove sulfhydryl-containing contaminants. We also examined the effect of M135 alkylation in an independent model of HCV entry where E1E2 is displayed on the surface of retroviral particles that are capable of mediating a single cycle of entry into hepatocytes, HCVpp. This system, which has been used extensively to identify and study the role of cellular factors in HCV entry (47Zeisel M.B. Fofana I. Fafi-Kremer S. Baumert T.F. J. Hepatol. 2011; 54: 566-576Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar), enables visualization of E1E2 by Western blotting and immunoprecipitation, as well as measurement of CD81 binding activity. For HCVpp, particles bearing E1 and E2 from prototype strain H77c were produced in HEK 293T cells. Seventy-two h post-transfection, HCVpp were pelleted by ultracentrifugation to deplete sulfhydryl contaminants present in the medium and resuspended in TN-Ca2+. Preparations of HCVcc/pp were treated with M135 in TN-Ca2+ buffer for 50 min at 37 °C. Reactions were quenched by addition of DMF20NEA, and then alkylated virus was applied to Huh7.5 cells for 2 h at 37 °C. Excess virus was removed, and cells were incubated at 37 °C for 3 days prior to luciferase assay. Significant inhibition of HCVcc entry was observed in a dose-dependant manner when virus was incubated with 0.2, 0.5, and 1 mm M135 (p < 0.05, Student's t test) compared with untreated virus (Fig. 1A). Complete inhibition of entry occurred at 0.5 and 1 mm M135. Inhibition by M135 was virus dose-dependent with an HCVcc titer of 2420 TCID50/ml sufficient to overcome the inhibitory effect of 1 mm M135, whereas complete inhibition was achieved with 1210 TCID50/ml or less (Fig. 1B). When HCVpp was alkylated with 0.5, 1, 2, and 5 mm M135, entry was significantly lowered compared with untreated virus (p < 0.05, Student's t test) (Fig. 1C). In contrast to the complete inhibition of entry observed for HCVcc, HCVpp required higher concentrations of M135 to achieve 80% inhibition. Increasing the concentration of M135 used to alkylate HCVpp to 10 mm did not result in >80% inhibition of entry (data not shown), suggesting that a component of E1E2 incorporated into HCVpp cannot be inhibited by M135. To establish the specificity of M135 alkylation, we examined whether vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) envelope protein G (VSVG) mediated entry was sensitive to M135 alkylation. The VSV G protein contains 12 Cys residues engaged in 6 disulfide bonds in both pre- and post-fusion conformations and there have been no reports of this virus being sensitive to alkylating agents (48Roche S. Rey F.A. Gaudin Y. Bressanelli S. Science. 2007; 315: 843-848Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar, 49Roche S. Bressanelli S. Rey F.A. Gaudin Y. Science. 2006; 313: 187-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar). Retroviral particles pseudotyped with VSV G protein (VSVGpp) were produced and prepared as described for HCVpp. Entry of VSVGpp remained unaffected following incubation with up to 5 mm M135 (Fig. 1C). Given that VSVG contains no free sulfhydryl groups with which M135 can react, this finding indicates that the inhibition of entry observed for M135-alkylated HCV is mediated via free sulfhydryls. To confirm that the inhibitory effect of M135 on virus entry was not due to cellular toxicity, Huh7.5 cells were incubated with increasing concentrations of M135 for 2 h at 37 °C. Seventy-two h later, cell viabilit"

HA regulates SMC proliferation, migration, and inflammation, which accelerates neointima formation. We used the HA synthesis inhibitor 4-methylumbelliferone (4-MU) to reduce HA production in human aortic SMCs and found a significant increase of apoptotic cells. Interestingly, the exogenous addition of HA together with 4-MU reduced apoptosis. A similar anti-apoptotic effect was observed also by adding other glycosaminoglycans and glucose to 4-MU-treated cells. Furthermore, the anti-apoptotic effect of HA was mediated by Toll-like receptor 4, CD44, and PI3K but not by ERK1/2."

An internal tandem duplication (ITD) in the juxtamembrane domain of Flt3 (Flt3-ITD) contributes to transformation and is associated with poor prognosis in acute myeloid leukemia. Here, we demonstrate that, as compared with wild-type Flt3 (Flt3-WT), Flt3-ITD more rapidly undergoes degradation through the proteasomal and lysosomal pathways in model hematopoietic 32D cells and in human leukemic MV4-11 cells. The Hsp90 inhibitor 17-allylaminodemethoxygeldanamycin (17-AAG) preferentially induced the polyubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of Flt3-ITD autophosphorylated on Tyr-591 in these cells. The E3 ubiquitin ligases c-Cbl and to a lesser extent Cbl-b facilitated at least partly Lys-48-linked polyubiquitination of autophosphorylated Flt3-ITD when coexpressed in 293T cells. Moreover, c-Cbl and Cbl-b facilitated degradation of Flt3-ITD in 293T cells and significantly enhanced the 17-AAG-induced decline in autophosphorylated Flt3-ITD. The enhancement of Flt3-ITD degradation was also observed in 32D cells inducibly overexpressing c-Cbl or Cbl-b. Furthermore, overexpression of loss-of-function mutants of both c-Cbl (c-Cbl-R420Q) and Cbl-b (Cbl-b-C373A) together in 32D cells retarded the degradation of autophosphorylated Flt3-ITD and significantly inhibited the 17-AAG-induced degradation of Flt3-ITD to confer the resistance to cytotoxicity of 17-AAG on these cells. These results suggest that c-Cbl as well as Cbl-b may play important roles in Hsp90 inhibitor-induced degradation of Flt3-ITD through the ubiquitin proteasome system and in regulation of the basal expression level of Flt3-ITD in leukemic cells.

Wild-type Flt3 (Flt3-WT) has been shown to be highly expressed in several hematopoietic malignancies including 70–100% cases of acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Oncogenic internal tandem duplication (ITD) mutations in the juxtamembrane domain of Flt3 (Flt3-ITD) and point mutations within the tyrosine kinase domain, such as the most predominant D835Y mutation, are the most frequent kinase mutations in AML, occurring in 25–30 and 5–10% of cases, respectively, and are associated with poor prognosis (1Meshinchi S.

Flt3-ITD results in ligand-independent autophosphorylation and activation of the receptor with subsequent activation of multiple downstream targets, including the signal transducer and activator of transcription 5 (STAT5), mitogen-activated protein kinase, and Akt pathways. Flt3-ITD has been shown to induce a myeloproliferative disorder in murine models. Flt3-ITD exists partially in an immature, underglycosylated, constitutively phosphorylated form (4Schmidt-Arras D.E.

The proteasomal degradation of targeted proteins, including protein kinases, requires polyubiquitination catalyzed by a series of enzymes containing ubiquitin activating enzymes (E1), ubiquitin conjugases (E2), and ubiquitin ligases (E3) (12Jung T.

E3 ubiquitin ligases confer substrate specificity and are responsible for mediating the transfer of ubiquitin from E2s to the substrates. The Cbl proteins are a highly conserved family of RING finger E3 ubiquitin ligases that regulate signaling by receptor and non-receptor-tyrosine kinases, including EGF receptor, PDGF receptor α, and FMS (14Swaminathan G. Tsygankov A.Y. J. Cell Physiol. 2006; 209: 21-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). There are three mammalian Cbl proteins encoded by separate genes: c-Cbl, Cbl-b, and Cbl-c. These proteins contain an N-terminal phosphotyrosine binding domain that allows direct interaction with activated receptor-tyrosine kinases and a RING finger domain that classifies Cbl proteins as E3 ubiquitin ligases. Recently, mutations of c-Cbl as well as Cbl-b have been found in various hematological neoplasms, including myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative neoplasms, myeloproliferative neoplasms, and secondary AML (15Kales S.C. Ryan P.E. Nau M.M. Lipkowitz S. Cancer Res. 2010; 70: 4789-4794Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar).

Furthermore, overexpression of loss-of-function c-Cbl mutants identified in AML cases, such as c-Cbl-R420Q, with Flt3 in IL-3-dependent murine model hematopoietic cell lines 32D and BaF3-induced autophosphorylation of Flt3, activation of its downstream signaling events, and IL-3-independent proliferation (10Sargin B.

More recently, mice with a loss-of-function mutation of c-Cbl (c-Cbl-C379A) or Cbl-b (Cbl-b-C373A) have been shown to develop a myeloproliferative disease that progressed to leukemia, which exhibited augmented Flt3 signaling and was prevented through mating with FL knock-out mice (17Rathinam C. Thien C.B. Flavell R.A. Langdon W.Y. Cancer Cell. 2010; 18: 341-352Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Thus, c-Cbl as well as Cbl-b is strongly implicated in regulation of Flt3 signaling and in leukemogenesis through its disturbance. However, little is known about the involvement of Cbls in regulation of Flt3-ITD expression and about its molecular mechanisms. Oncogenic kinases have been shown to adopt various mechanisms that spare them from negative regulatory processes. One mechanism that attenuates the conformational instability of oncogenic proteins is their association with the Hsp90 chaperone, which controls the folding and intracellular trafficking of diverse cellular proteins involved in signal transduction and cell cycle regulation (18Pearl L.H. Prodromou C. Workman P. Biochem. J. 2008; 410: 439-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar, 19Trepel J. Mollapour M. Giaccone G. Neckers L. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2010; 10: 537-549Crossref PubMed Scopus (1149) Google Scholar). Hsp90 has been shown to form complexes with many cellular proteins that are important for cancer or leukemic cells, such as BCR/ABL and Flt3-ITD. Thus, more than a dozen Hsp90 inhibitors are currently undergoing clinical evaluation in cancer and leukemic patients (19Trepel J. Mollapour M. Giaccone G. Neckers L. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2010; 10: 537-549Crossref PubMed Scopus (1149) Google Scholar, 20Banerji U. Clin. Cancer Res. 2009; 15: 9-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). One of the promising Hsp90 inhibitors is 17-allylaminodemethoxygeldanamycin (17-AAG), which interacts with the ATP binding pocket of Hsp90, thereby inhibiting ATP binding and chaperone function of Hsp90. Previously, 17-AAG was shown to disrupt the chaperone association of Hsp90 with Flt3-ITD (8George P. Bali P. Annavarapu S. Scuto A. Fiskus W. Guo F. Sigua C. Sondarva G. Moscinski L. Atadja P. Bhalla K. Blood. 2005; 105: 1768-1776Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). Inhibition of the Hsp90 by 17-AAG or geldanamycin has also been demonstrated to result in degradation of Flt3-ITD and apoptosis in myeloid cell lines transfected with Flt3-ITD as well as in primary AML cells expressing Flt3-ITD (21Al Shaer L.

Cancer Res. 2003; 9: 4483-4493PubMed Google Scholar). But molecular mechanisms involved in degradation of Flt3-ITD induced by Hsp90 inhibitors and in regulation of its sensitivity still remain to be examined. In this study we examine the mechanisms regulating stability and 17-AAG-induced degradation of Flt3-ITD in the IL-3-dependent hematopoietic progenitor model cell line 32Dcl3, human leukemic MV4-11 cells, and in the transient expression system using 293T cells. This study reveals important roles for c-Cbl and Cbl-b in constitutive and 17-AAG-induced degradation of autophosphorylated Flt3-ITD through the ubiquitin proteasome system, which should shed light on the pathogenesis of refractory AML with Flt3-ITD as well as with mutations in c-Cbl or Cbl-b and may contribute to the development of its effective therapeutic strategies. Murine IL-3-dependent 32Dcl3 cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS) and 10% WEHI conditioned medium as the source of IL-3 as described previously (24Miura O.

Expression plasmids, pTRE-tight-Flt3-WT and pTRE-tight-Flt3-ITD, were constructed by subcloning the NotI/HindIII fragments coding for human Flt3-WT and Flt3-ITD from pcDNA3-Flt3-WT and pcDNA3-Flt3-ITD, respectively, into pTRE-tight. Retroviral expression plasmids, pMXs-IG-Flt3-ITD and pRevTRE-Flt3-ITD, were constructed by subcloning the NotI/HindIII fragment from pcDNA3-Flt3-ITD into pMXs-IG and pRevTRE, respectively. A retroviral expression plasmid, pRevTRE-Flt3-D835Y, was constructed by exchanging a Flt3 cDNA fragment (nucleotides 1673–3049 of GenBankTM accession number BC144040 coding for Pro-536 to the C terminus) obtained from primary AML cells expressing Flt3-D835Y with the corresponding region of pRevTRE-Flt3-ITD. The plasmid DNA coding for the intracellular portion of Flt3 was sequenced to confirm that it contained the D835Y mutation but not the ITD mutation. Retroviral expression plasmids, pRevTRE-c-Cbl and pRevTRE-c-Cbl-C381A, were constructed by subcloning the BamHI fragment coding for c-Cbl and c-Cbl-C381A from pCEFL-c-Cbl and pCEFL-c-Cbl-C381A, respectively, into pRevTRE. Retroviral expression plasmids, pRevTRE-Cbl-b and pRevTRE-Cbl-b-C373A, were constructed by subcloning the HindIII/EcoRV fragments coding for Cbl-b and Cbl-b-C373A from pCEFL-Cbl-b and pCEFL-Cbl-b-C373A, respectively, into pRevTRE. For inducible expression of Flt3-WT or Flt3-ITD in 32Dcl3 cells, 32Dcl3 cells were first transfected with pTet-On (Clontech) by electroporation using Gene Pulser (Bio-Rad) at 330 V and 960 microfarads. Transfected cells were selected in medium containing G418, and clones were selected by limiting dilution. A selected clone, Ton.32D, was used for control experiments and for cotransfection with pTRE-tight-Flt3-WT or pTRE-tight-Flt3-ITD and pMAM2-BSD (Funakoshi, Tokyo, Japan) by electroporation. Transfected cells were selected in medium containing G418 and blasticidin. Several clones were isolated by limiting dilution and examined for the induction of Flt3-WT or Flt3-ITD expression by the addition of DOX. A selected clone, Ton.32D/Flt3-WT or Ton.32D/Flt3-ITD, was used for subsequent experiments. To obtain 32Dcl3 cells that inducibly express Flt3-D835Y, PLAT-A cells were first transfected with pRevTRE-Flt3-D835Y using the Lipofectamine reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instruction. The recombinant retrovirus was harvested 60 h after transfection and used to infect Ton.32D cells. Infected cells were selected in DOX-containing medium without IL-3 to give Ton.32D/Flt3-D835Y cells. Pools of these infected cells were used for subsequent experiments. To obtain Flt3-ITD-expressing cells that inducibly overexpress c-Cbl, c-Cbl-C381A, Cbl-b, or Cbl-b-C373A and control cells, Ton.32D cells were infected with the recombinant retrovirus obtained from PLAT-A transfected with pRevTRE-c-Cbl, -c-Cbl-C381A, -Cbl-b, -Cbl-b-C373A, or pRevTRE. Infected cells were then selected in medium containing hygromycin to give Ton.32D/pRevTRE-c-Cbl, -c-Cbl-C381A, -Cbl-b, -Cbl-b-C373A, and Ton.32D/pRevTRE cells. These cells were subsequently infected again with the recombinant retrovirus obtained from PLAT-A transfected with pMXs-IG-Flt3-ITD. Infected cells were selected in medium without IL-3 to give Ton.32D/Flt3-ITD/pRevTRE-c-Cbl, -c-Cbl-C381A, -Cbl-b, -Cbl-b-C373A, and Ton.32D/Flt3-ITD/pRevTRE cells. Pools of these infected cells were used for subsequent experiments. To obtain Ton.32D/Flt3-ITD or Ton.32D/Flt3-WT cells that overexpress both c-Cbl-R420Q and Cbl-b-C373A, these cells were first infected with the recombinant pMIG-c-Cbl-R420Q retrovirus. Cells expressing green fluorescent protein (GFP) were sorted using a BD Biosciences FACSscan flow cytometer (Mountain View, CA). GFP-positive cells were infected again with the recombinant pRevTRE-Cbl-b-CA retrovirus and selected in medium containing hygromycin to give Ton.32D/Flt3-ITD/c-Cbl-RQ/Cbl-b-CA and Ton.32D/Flt3-WT/c-Cbl-RQ/Cbl-b-CA cells. Pools of infected cells were used for subsequent experiments. For transient expression in 293T cells, cells were transfected with the indicated plasmids using the Lipofectamine reagent according to the manufacture's instruction. Cells were harvested 48 h after transfection for immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting. Cell viability was measured by the sodium 3′-[1-(phenylaminocarbonyl)-3,4-tetrazolium]-bis(4-methoxy-6-nitro)benzene sulfonic acid hydrate (XTT) colorimetric assay using the Cell Proliferation Kit II (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) according to the manufacturer's instructions. In brief, cells were cultured in a 96-well plate at 2 × 105 cells/ml in the indicated concentrations of 17-AAG and cultured for 36 h. The XTT labeling mixture was added for 4 h before the optical density at 490 nm was measured with a microplate reader. To examine the kinetics of Flt3-WT and Flt3-ITD degradation in hematopoietic cells, we first analyzed Ton.32D/Flt3-WT and Ton.32D/Flt3-ITD cells, which express Flt3-WT or Flt3-ITD when cultured with DOX. Previously, it has been shown that Flt3 migrates in SDS-PAGE as two bands that correspond to the immature intracellular receptor of 130 kDa and the mature glycosylated receptor of 155 kDa expressed on the cell surface (34Mizuki M. Fenski R. Halfter H. Matsumura I. Schmidt R. Müller C. Grüning W. Kratz-Albers K. Serve S. Steur C. Büchner T. Kienast J. Kanakura Y. Berdel W.E. Serve H.

Blood. 2005; 106: 265-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1A, treatment of cells with the protein synthesis inhibitor CHX revealed that FL facilitated degradation of the mature form of Flt3-WT, which however, was not as unstable as that of Flt3-ITD. On the other hand, the turnover of the intracellular form was more rapid, with no significant difference observed between Flt3-WT and Flt3-ITD. To examine the possible effect of activation and autophosphorylation of Flt3 on its stability, we examined the effect of sorafenib, which very effectively inhibits the kinase activity of Flt3-ITD (36Zhang W. Konopleva M. Shi Y.X. McQueen T. Harris D. Ling X. Estrov Z. Quintás-Cardama A. Small D. Cortes J. Andreeff M. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 2008; 100: 184-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1B, sorafenib increased the expression level of mature Flt3-ITD and drastically inhibited its degradation in CHX-treated cells, whereas it significantly inhibited tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT5, thus indicating that Flt3-ITD was effectively inhibited. These data suggest that the degradation of Flt3 expressed on the cell surface may be facilitated by its activation and autophosphorylation. We then explored the cellular degradation pathways of Flt3-WT and Flt3-ITD by using the proteasome inhibitor MG132 and the lysosome inhibitor chloroquine. In addition, we used the pan-caspase inhibitor t-butoxycarbonyl-D-fmk or benzyloxycarbonyl-VAD-fmk to exclude putative apoptotic degradation of Flt3-ITD (11Buchwald M. Pietschmann K. Müller J.P. Böhmer F.D. Heinzel T. Krämer O.H. Leukemia. 2010; 24: 1412-1421Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1, C and D, MG132 and, to a lesser degree, chloroquine inhibited degradation of the mature forms of Flt3-WT and Flt3-ITD. These two inhibitors similarly inhibited degradation of the immature form of Flt3-ITD without significantly affecting that of Flt3-WT. Consistent with these data, MG132 and chloroquine retarded the degradation of both mature and immature forms of Flt3-ITD in human leukemic MV4-11 cells as well (Fig. 1E). These data indicate that Flt3-ITD constitutively undergoes both proteasomal and lysosomal degradation. Previously, it has been reported that Hsp90 inhibitors including 17-AAG induced apoptosis selectively in Flt3-ITD-positive leukemia cells (22Minami Y. Kiyoi H. Yamamoto Y. Yamamoto K. Ueda R.

The N-terminal, globular noncollagenous domain (NC4) of the α1(IX) chain protrudes away from the surface of the fibrils into the surrounding matrix and is available for molecular interactions. To define these interactions, we used the NC4 domain in a yeast two-hybrid screen of a human chondrocyte cDNA library. 73% of the interacting clones encoded fibronectin. The interaction was confirmed using in vitro immunoprecipitation and was further characterized by surface plasmon resonance. Using whole and pepsin-derived preparations of type IX collagen, the interaction was shown to be specific for the NC4 domain with no interaction with the triple helical collagenous domains. The interaction was shown to be of high affinity with nanomolar Kd values. Analysis of the fibronectin-interacting clones indicates that the constant domain is the likely site of interaction. Type IX collagen and fibronectin were shown to co-localize in cartilage. This novel interaction between the NC4 domain of type IX collagen and fibronectin may represent an in vivo interaction in cartilage that could contribute to the matrix integrity of the tissue. Type IX collagen is covalently bound to the surface of type II collagen fibrils within the cartilage extracellular matrix. The N-terminal, globular noncollagenous domain (NC4) of the α1(IX) chain protrudes away from the surface of the fibrils into the surrounding matrix and is available for molecular interactions. To define these interactions, we used the NC4 domain in a yeast two-hybrid screen of a human chondrocyte cDNA library. 73% of the interacting clones encoded fibronectin.

A network composed of stable collagen fibrils confers tensile strength to articular cartilage to resist the repeated loading as occurs in vivo. The principal components of this network are collagen types II, IX, and XI, forming heterotypic fibrils, in which type IX collagen is covalently cross-linked to the surface of type II collagen in a D-periodic arrangement along the fibrils (1Eyre D.R.

A member of the fibril-associated collagens with an interrupted triple helix (FACIT) family of collagens, type IX is a heterotrimer of three genetically distinct polypeptide chains, α1(IX), α2(IX), and α3(IX), stabilized by interchain disulfide bonds. The complete molecule consists of three triple helical domains (COL1–3) and four noncollagenous domains (NC1–4) (for reviews see Refs. 5Olsen B.R. Int. J. Biochem.

This elevates the COL3 and the N-terminal globular NC4 domains of the α1(IX) chain away from the heterotypic fibril surface projecting it into the surrounding matrix (7Vaughan L. Mendler M. Huber S.

This position makes the COL3 and NC4 domains ideal candidates for interactions with other matrix molecules. In vitro studies substantiate this hypothesis. The COL3 domain has been shown to interact strongly with the I domain of integrins using a novel binding site possibly involving amino acids from more than one chain (8Käpylä J. Jäälinoja J. Tulla M. Ylöstalo J. Nissinen L. Viitasalo T. Vehviläinen P. Marjomäki V. Nykvist P. Säämänen A.M. Farndale R.W. Birk D.E. Ala-Kokko L. Heino J. J. Biol.

Thus, type IX collagen is implicated in cell adhesion to the type II/XI/IX collagen macromolecular alloy. The α1(IX) NC4 domain also interacts with thrombospondin 5 (TSP5), also known as cartilage oligomeric protein (COMP) (9Holden P. Meadows R.S. Chapman K.L. Grant M.E. Kadler K.E. Briggs M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 6046-6055Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar), which, as a pentamer, can participate in multiple interactions, including an interaction with matrilin-3 (10Mann H.H. Ozbek S. Engel J. Paulsson M. Wagener R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 25294-25298Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Type IX collagen can also interact with matrilin-3 directly through a binding site in the COL3 domain (11Budde B. Blumbach K. Ylöstalo J. Zaucke F. Ehlen H.W. Wagener R. Ala-Kokko L. Paulsson M. Bruckner P. Grässel S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 10465-10478Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) implicating matrilin-3 as an interface component, linking macromolecular networks. Furthermore, the basic NC4 domain of the α1(IX) chain can interact with heparin (12Pihlajamaa T. Lankinen H. Ylöstalo J. Valmu L. Jäälinoja J. Zaucke F. Spitznagel L. Gösling S. Puustinen A.

Haglund L. Heinegård D. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 28543-28553Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). As a consequence of all of the interactions in which type IX collagen can participate, it is not surprising that its perceived function is to stabilize and organize the fibrillar collagen network in cartilage. Type IX collagen exists as a long or a short form depending on the presence or absence of the NC4 domain that is regulated by an alternative promoter in intron 6 of the COL9A1 gene (14Nishimura I. Muragaki Y. Olsen B.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 20033-20041Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The existence of this alternative promoter in the COL9A1 gene is indicative of a specific functional role for the NC4 domain. The specific expression of the NC4 domain in cartilage (14Nishimura I. Muragaki Y. Olsen B.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 20033-20041Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and its pericellular localization (15Duance V.C. Shimokomaki M. Bailey A.J. Biosci. Rep. 1982; 2: 223-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) has identified a potential role in remodeling the cartilage matrix. In addition, loss of type IX collagen in aging articular cartilage may result in a weaker matrix that is more susceptible to degradation (16Duance V.C. Wotton S.F. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1991; 19: 376SCrossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar, 17Wotton S.F. Jeacocke R.E. Maciewicz R.A. Wardale R.J. Duance V.C. Histochem. J. 1991; 23: 328-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). More recently, analysis of human articular cartilage has determined that both the C terminus of type IX collagen and the NC4 domain are lost from the territorial and interterritorial matrices after maturation but are maintained in the pericellular matrix in articular cartilage throughout life (1Eyre D.R. Pietka T. Weis M.A. Wu J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 2568-2574Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 18Vaughan-Thomas A. Dudhia J. Bayliss M.T. Kadler K.E. Duance V.C. Connect. Tissue Res. 2008; 49: 374-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Studies on transgenic mice have supported the hypothesis that NC4 domain interactions play an important role in articular cartilage matrix integrity. Several transgenic mice expressing abnormal type IX collagen have been produced, all of which exhibit a form of degenerative joint disease similar to osteoarthritis (OA) (19Nakata K. Ono K. Miyazaki J. Olsen B.R. Muragaki Y. Adachi E. Yamamura K. Kimura T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1993; 90: 2870-2874Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 20Fässler R. Schnegelsberg P.N.

Shinya T. Olsen B.R. Inflamm. Res. 1995; 44: 127-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Homozygous α1(IX) knock-out mice are viable but develop a severe degenerative joint disease that is similar to OA, as early as 4 months (20Fässler R. Schnegelsberg P.N. Dausman J. Shinya T. Muragaki Y. McCarthy M.T. Olsen B.R. Jaenisch R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1994; 91: 5070-5074Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). Transgenic mice expressing a truncated α1(IX) chain also develop degenerative joint disease with the severity of disease correlating with the level of transgene expression (19Nakata K. Ono K. Miyazaki J. Olsen B.R. Muragaki Y. Adachi E. Yamamura K. Kimura T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1993; 90: 2870-2874Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Importantly, overexpression of the NC4 domain alone also caused a degenerative joint disease phenotype, shown to be significant in mice between 11 and 21 months old (21Haimes H.B. Jimenez P.A. Li Y. Shinya T. Olsen B.R. Inflamm. Res. 1995; 44: 127-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar), indicating a specific role for NC4 interactions in maintaining cartilage matrix integrity. Col9a1 gene knockouts in combination with various thrombospondins result in disruption of the growth plate (22Blumbach K. Bastiaansen-Jenniskens Y.M. DeGroot J. Paulsson M. van Osch G.J. Zaucke F. Arthritis Rheum. 2009; 60: 3676-3685Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 23Posey K.L. Hankenson K. Veerisetty A.C. Bornstein P. Lawler J. Hecht J.T. Am. J. Pathol. 2008; 172: 1664-1674Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), and Col9a1/TSP5 double knock-out mice are particularly prone to exercise-induced articular cartilage degradation (23Posey K.L. Hankenson K. Veerisetty A.C. Bornstein P. Lawler J. Hecht J.T. Am. J. Pathol. 2008; 172: 1664-1674Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). These studies show that the absence of type IX collagen and in some instances specific disruption of the NC4 domain predisposes articular cartilage to OA-like degradation, indicating that the NC4 domain and type IX are important for long term tissue stability and cartilage matrix integrity. Human diseases associated with mutations in the genes encoding type IX collagen also provide evidence for its role in articular cartilage matrix stability. Type IX collagen mutations have been linked with the autosomal dominant disease, multiple epiphyseal dysplasia, characterized by short stature and severe joint pain caused by early onset, sometimes pre-adolescent, OA. Multiple epiphyseal dysplasia causing mutations identified in all three type IX collagen genes are located within the N terminus of the COL3 domain of the molecule. Mutations in COL9A2 and COL9A3 genes result in skipping of exon 3, leading to the in-frame deletion of 12 amino acids within the equivalent regions of the COL3 domain of the α2(IX) and α3(IX) chains (for review see Ref. 24Briggs M.D. Chapman K.L. Hum. Mutat. 2002; 19: 465-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). A single mutation in the COL9A1 gene that is linked to an unclassified phenotype of multiple epiphyseal dysplasia has been identified that gives rise to an in-frame deletion, also at the N-terminal end of the COL3 domain, of either 21, 25, or 49 amino acids (25Czarny-Ratajczak M. Lohiniva J. Rogala P. Kozlowski K. Perälä M. Carter L. Spector T.D. Kolodziej L. Seppänen U. Glazar R. Królewski J. Latos-Bielenska A. Ala-Kokko L. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 2001; 69: 969-980Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Such deletions within any one of the three chains encoding the COL3 domain of type IX collagen may significantly alter the tertiary structure of the molecule. This may result in a shift in the spatial arrangement of the NC4 domain, impairment of NC4 matrix interactions, and consequently the characteristic cartilage degradation observed in this disease. To elucidate the protein-protein interactions of the NC4 domain of type IX collagen in articular cartilage, we used the NC4 domain as “bait” in a yeast two-hybrid screen of a human chondrocyte cDNA library. 73% of interacting clones were found to encode cellular fibronectin (FN). Molecular analysis of the FN clones demonstrated that the constant domain of FN may be important in this interaction. The interaction was verified and characterized in vitro by surface plasmon resonance (SPR) and immunoprecipitation experiments. To investigate the type IX collagen-FN interaction in vivo, we have analyzed bovine articular cartilage by immunohistochemistry showing that type IX collagen and FN co-localize within the cartilage matrix. These data provide evidence for an in vivo type IX collagen-FN interaction in articular cartilage. All reagents were obtained from Sigma unless otherwise stated. All yeast two-hybrid media and reagents were prepared according to the MatchmakerTM 3 manual (Clontech) and the yeast protocols handbook (Clontech) unless otherwise stated. A 750-bp sequence encoding the entire NC4 domain of human COL9A1 (bases 10–753 of GenBankTM accession number NM_001851.2) was generated by a PCR of a human chondrocyte cDNA library (Clontech) with PCR primers (NC4F, 5′-tctgcagctgctaagcgtc-3′; NC4R, 5′-acctctctcgtcggtggtct-3′). Adapted NC4F and NC4R PCR primers containing NdeI and SalI restriction site linkers, respectively, were used to facilitate the cloning of the 750-bp NC4 sequence in-frame with the GAL4 DNA binding domain (DNA BD) in the bait plasmid, pGBKT7 (Clontech). The pGBKT7-NC4 construct was sequenced (ABI Prism 3100, PerkinElmer Life Sciences) to confirm the identity and the open reading frame (NCBI BLAST search engine (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov)). The MatchmakerTM 3 two-hybrid system was used to screen a human chondrocyte cDNA library (Clontech) for potential NC4 domain interacting partners. The cDNA library was generated by directional cloning of cDNAs generated from unstimulated or IL-1 or TGF-β-stimulated human primary chondrocytes into pACT2, retaining the reading frame with the GAL4 DNA transcriptional activation domain (AD). Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain, AH109 (MATa, trp1-901, leu2-3, 112, ura3-52, his3-200, gal4Δ, gal80Δ, LYS::GAL1UAS-GAL1TATA-HIS3, GAL2UAS-GAL2TATA-ADE2, URA::MEL1UAS-MEL1TATA-lacZ), was transformed with 0.5 μg of pGBKT7-NC4 plasmid using the polyethylene glycol/single strand DNA/lithium acetate transformation method (26Gietz R.D. Schiestl R.H. Willems A.R. Woods R.A. Yeast. 1995; 11: 355-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (1695) Google Scholar), A large scale transformation of the DNA BD-NC4-transformed yeast cells that scaled up the standard high efficiency transformation protocol 90-fold was then used to screen 45 μg of amplified human chondrocyte AD-cDNA library. An interaction between the NC4 bait protein (fused to the DNA BD) and a library-encoded protein (fused to the AD) creates a novel transcription factor that activates the GAL4-responsive reporter genes, ADE2, HIS3, and lacZ. The transformed cells were spread onto 50 × 150 mm −Leu/−Trp/−His/−Ade plates and incubated for up to 14 days at 30 °C. Surviving colonies representing putative yeast two-hybrid positives were further screened for LacZ reporter expression using the β-galactosidase colony filter assay (27Gietz R.D. Methods Mol. Biol. 2006; 313: 345-371PubMed Google Scholar). Plasmids were extracted from positive yeast cells as described previously (28Hoffman C.S. Winston F. Gene. 1987; 57: 267-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (2040) Google Scholar) and transformed into Escherichia coli strain JM109 (29Hanahan D. J. Mol. Biol. 1983; 166: 557-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (8170) Google Scholar). Ampicillin (50 μg/ml) was used to select for transformants containing pACT2-cDNA plasmids, and kanamycin (100 μg/ml) was used to select for those containing pGBKT7-NC4 plasmids. Plasmids were purified from E. coli using the Qiagen high speed midi kit according to the manufacturer's instructions. To confirm interactions, the cDNA library clones identified as interacting with the NC4 domain were co-transformed into yeast (AH109) with either the NC4 or control plasmids. The NC4-cDNA interaction was reconstructed in yeast by co-transformation of pGBKT7-NC4 and pACT2 cDNA. Control plasmids for the expression of proteins known to interact (pACT2-T antigen and pGBKT7-p53) were used to construct a positive control interaction. pACT2-cDNA transformed alone or co-transformed with either pGBKT7 alone or a pGBKT7-lamin C fusion was used as a negative control. All transformations were achieved using the polyethylene glycol/single strand DNA/lithium acetate transformation method (26Gietz R.D. Schiestl R.H. Willems A.R. Woods R.A. Yeast. 1995; 11: 355-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (1695) Google Scholar), and each of the transformants was tested for reporter gene expression by growth on −Leu/−Trp/−His/−Ade agar plates and the β-galactosidase colony filter assay (27Gietz R.D. Methods Mol. Biol. 2006; 313: 345-371PubMed Google Scholar). PCR primers designed to the flanking region of the pACT2 multiple cloning site (pACT2F 5′-gaacttgcggggtttttcagt-3′ and pACT2R 5′-cgcgtttggaatcactac-3′) were used to sequence several positive colonies where the interaction had been confirmed (ABI Prism 3100, PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Sequence data were analyzed using the NCBI BLAST search engine, NCBI ORF finder, DNAsis (Hitachi Software Engineering), Webcutter 2.0, and NCBI human genome data base (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov). Because a number of interacting clones encoded FN, PCR primers were designed to the C-terminal end of human FN (GenBankTM accession number X02761.1). FNF (5′-gtgggcaactctgtcaacgaa-3′) and FNR (5′-tcgggaatcttctctgtcacg-3′) primers were then used to PCR screen remaining interacting clones (pACT2-cDNA). To confirm the interaction between fibronectin and the α1(IX) NC4 domain, immunoprecipitation experiments were carried out using recombinant human NC4 (see below) and human fibronectin (Upstate). The human COL9a1 NC4 sequence was amplified by PCR and inserted into the pCEP4 expression vector (Invitrogen) using KpnI and XhoI restriction sites. The reverse primer contained an engineered FLAG tag amino acid sequence on the C terminus of the NC4 domain followed by a stop codon and the XhoI restriction enzyme site (NC4r, CCC CCC TCG AGT CAC TTG TCA TCG TCG TCC TTG TAG TCT CTC TCG TCG GTG). An upstream forward primer encoded the first 20 nucleotides of the NC4 domain from the ATG start codon and included a KpnI restriction enzyme site (NC4f, CGG CGG TAC CCA TGA AGA CCT GCT GGA AAA TT). A pCEP4 vector containing the human NC4 sequence was prepared using the above restriction sites and standard cloning techniques (30Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Manniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). DNA preparations of the pCEP4 vector were sequenced to confirm the identity and orientation of the NC4 domain insert. pCEP4 plasmid (2 μg) containing the NC4 domain was transfected into confluent human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293-EBNA (Invitrogen) cells using Lipofectin® (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. HEK 293-EBNA cells constitutively express the Epstein-Barr virus nuclear antigen-1 (EBNA-1) allowing for the high copy episomal replication of the oriP containing the pCEP4 vector. After 72 h cells were subcultured using standard protocols and transfected clones selected using hygromycin (300 μg/ml, Invitrogen) in complete DMEM containing 10% fetal calf serum (FCS). Clones expressing rhNC4 protein were expanded and maintained in the medium containing hygromycin. To facilitate the purification and maintain production of rhNC4 secreted into the media, cells approaching confluency were cultured sequentially with complete DMEM containing 2% FCS and hygromycin and serum-free conditions using Ex-Cell® VPRO culture media containing hygromycin. The cell-conditioned serum-free media were removed for purification and replaced every 4 days. Serum-free media harvested from rhNC4 expressing HEK 295-EBNA cells was centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 15 min and filtered through a 0.2-μm filter. Protease inhibitors (100 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor, 10 mm N-ethylmaleimide, 10 mm EDTA, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) were added to the media, and 1 m Tris (pH 8.0) was added in a 1:10 ratio with media. An anti-FLAG affinity column was used to purify rhNC4 from the filtered serum-free culture media. A batch absorption method was used whereby 50 ml of filtered culture media were incubated with 1 ml of anti-FLAG resin for 1 h at 4 °C. The resin was washed with 15 ml of 0.15 m NaCl, 0.05 m Tris base (TBS) (pH 8.0), and the rhNC4 protein was eluted by competitive binding of a FLAG peptide at a concentration of 100 μg/ml in TBS. Between purifications, the column was stripped by washing the resin in 0.1 m glycine HCl (pH 3.5) followed by re-equilibration in TBS. Purified rhNC4 was dialyzed against TBS (pH 8.0) at 4 °C for 16 h to remove any co-purifying FLAG peptide that may be present in the eluate, and the concentration of rhNC4 was determined by BCA protein analysis (Pierce). Protein complexes were allowed to form by incubating 2 μg of human fibronectin (hFN, Upstate) with 54 μg of the purified rhNC4 in TBS (pH 8.0) at 4 °C for 16 h. Protein complexes were precipitated using either anti-FLAG M2 monoclonal antibody (9.2 μg) or a rabbit polyclonal FN antibody raised against a recombinant protein corresponding to amino acids 2087–2386 at the C terminus of human FN (8 μg) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) at room temperature for 1 h. In addition, to ensure specific antibody binding, rhNC4 (25 μg) alone was incubated with the anti-FN primary antibody (8 μg), and similarly hFN (1 μg) was incubated with the anti-FLAG primary antibody (9.2 μg) using identical conditions. Antibody-bound protein complexes were recovered by interaction with protein G-Sepharose (GE Healthcare). Briefly, 50 μl of protein G-Sepharose was added to the antibody/protein mixtures and incubated at 4 °C for 1 h with gentle agitation, and Sepharose-bound immunoprecipitates were recovered by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 20 s. The pellet was washed three times with TBS and resuspended in 30 μl of sample buffer (100 mm Tris-HCl, 2% SDS, 10% glycerol, 5% 2β-mercaptoethanol, 0.002% bromphenol blue). Samples were heated to 95 °C for 3 min and analyzed on polyacrylamide gels (10% (w/v)) in the presence of β-mercaptoethanol and Western blotting using nylon membranes (PVDF, Immobilon) (31Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207012) Google Scholar, 32Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44893) Google Scholar). Nonspecific sites on membranes were blocked by incubation in TBS (pH 8.0) containing 3% (w/v) skimmed milk powder for 30 min with shaking at room temperature. Membranes were then incubated with either anti-FLAG (1:2000) or anti-FN (1:500) in TBS (pH 8.0) containing 0.2% Tween 20, 1% (w/v) skimmed milk powder for 2 h at room temperature. Proteins were visualized using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (1:10,000), ECL reagent, and Hyperfilm (GE Healthcare) and compared with hFN and FLAG-tagged rhNC4 standards and molecular weight markers. Duplicate membranes were incubated without primary antibody to control for nonspecific secondary antibody binding. To confirm the interaction between type IX collagen and fibronectin, SPR was carried out using a BIAcore 3000. Whole type IX collagen (containing collagenous and noncollagenous domains) purified from rat chondrosarcoma (33Duance V.C. Wotton S.F. Voyle C.A. Bailey A.J. Biochem. J. 1984; 221: 885-889Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) and pepsinized type IX collagen purified from bovine cartilage (33Duance V.C. Wotton S.F. Voyle C.A. Bailey A.J. Biochem. J. 1984; 221: 885-889Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 34Shimokomaki M. Duance V.C. Bailey A.J. FEBS Lett. 1980; 121: 51-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) were solubilized in 10 mm sodium acetate (pH 4.0) and immobilized on individual flow cells on a CM5 chip (BIAcore). Immobilization levels were 500 resonance units (RU) for each ligand. As a control for changes in sample refractive index, a blank flow cell was subjected to the immobilization procedure without added protein. Human fibronectin (FN) (Upstate, 200 μg/ml) in running buffer (0.01 m HEPES (pH 7.4), 0.15 m NaCl, 0.005% surfactant P20) was injected over pepsinized and whole type IX collagen flow cells for 3 min at 30 μl/min with the uncoated surface as a reference. For affinity measurements, human cellular FN was injected in running buffer at 30 μl/min into the flow cells at concentrations 0–300 nm. The ligand surfaces were regenerated by two injections of 30 μl of 10 mm glycine (pH 2.0) between each experiment. No significant change in base-line readings was observed. The binding curves were obtained with reference to pepsinized type IX collagen. To further verify this interaction, the ligand surfaces were reversed. Human cellular FN was immobilized to flow cells 2–4 on a CM5 chip using standard BIAcore protocols. Increasing levels of FN were immobilized to flow cells 2–4, whereby 2000 and 4000 RU were bound, respectively. Flow cell 1 was activated as a protein-negative surface acting as a control for changes in refractive index. Whole type IX collagen (60 μg/ml) was injected over FN flow cells with 2000 and 4000 RU for 3 min at 20 μl/min to demonstrate an increase in binding with increased FN on the chip surface. Pepsinized type IX collagen (100 μg/ml) was also injected over this FN-coated surface for 3 min at a flow rate of 10 μl/min to verify the specificity to the noncollagenous domains of type IX collagen in both SPR circumstances. For affinity kinetic analysis, a concentration series of whole type IX collagen (0–450 nm) diluted in running buffer was injected over the FN surface (flow cell 2) for 5 min at a flow rate of 20 μl/min. Regeneration of the ligand surfaces between each experiment was achieved by washing in 20 mm NaOH for 30 s at a flow rate of 30 μl/min. No significant change in base-line readings was observed. Binding curves were obtained with reference to the blank flow cell. To determine affinity kinetics, sensogram data that was not required for analysis was removed ensuring that the association and dissociation binding events remained, followed by X and Y transformation of the curves. The association and dissociation rate constants were then determined using separate curve fits to the equation for 1:1 Langmuir binding in the BIAevaluation 3.1 software (BIAcore). The equilibrium dissociation constant (KD) of the interaction was calculated from these values for each curve allowing a range of KD values for this interaction to be determined. Cryosections of articular cartilage, obtained from the carpal joints of 18-month-old cow, were immunofluorescently dual-labeled for fibronectin and type IX collagen. Full thickness articular cartilage was rapidly frozen in liquid nitrogen-cooled isopentane, and 20-μm sections (Bright's cryostat) were transferred to glass slides coated with VECTABONDTM reagent (Vector Laboratories). Each step was performed at room temperature unless stated otherwise, and between each incubation step, sections were washed three times for 5 min in 0.01 m phosphate-buffered 0.13 m NaCl (PBS, pH 7.4) containing 0.001% Tween 20 ("
https://openalex.org/W1987756376,"Although a complete pathway of lipoic acid metabolism has been established in Escherichia coli, lipoic acid metabolism in other bacteria is more complex and incompletely understood. Listeria monocytogenes has been shown to utilize two lipoate-protein ligases for lipoic acid scavenging, whereas only one of the ligases can function in utilization of host-derived lipoic acid-modified peptides. We report that lipoic acid scavenging requires not only ligation of lipoic acid but also a lipoyl relay pathway in which an amidotransferase transfers lipoyl groups to the enzyme complexes that require the cofactor for activity. In addition, we provide evidence for a new lipoamidase activity that could allow utilization of lipoyl peptides by lipoate-protein ligase. These data support a model of an expanded, three-enzyme pathway for lipoic acid scavenging that seems widespread in the Firmicutes phylum of bacteria."
https://openalex.org/W2009555941,"Several factors regulate nerve growth factor (NGF), which is formed from pro-NGF by intracellular and extracellular enzymatic cleavage. The close proximity between mast cells expressing the protease tryptase and NGF-producing smooth muscle-like peritubular cells in the testes of infertile patients led us to examine whether tryptase is among those factors. Human peritubular cells express functional tryptase receptors (PAR-2). Recombinant enzymatically active β-tryptase increased NGF levels in the culture medium of primary human peritubular cells, but the peptide agonist for PAR-2 (SLIGKV) did not. Neither tryptase nor the peptide increased NGF mRNA levels. To test whether the increase in NGF is due to enzymatic activity of tryptase acting on pro-NGF, supernatants of peritubular cells and synthetic pro-NGF were treated with tryptase. Results of Western blot studies indicate enzymatic cleavage of pro-NGF by active tryptase. Heat-inactivated tryptase or SLIGKV was not effective. Mass spectrometry analysis of in vitro cleavage products from recombinant tryptase and synthetic pro-NGF revealed multiple cleavage sites within the pro-NGF sequence. The results also indicate the generation of mature NGF and smaller NGF fragments as a result of tryptase action. Thus, tryptase-secreting mast cells in the vicinity of pro-NGF/NGF-secreting cells in any human tissue are likely able to alter the ratios of pro-NGF/NGF. As NGF and pro-NGF have different affinities for their receptors, this indicates a novel way by which mast cells, via tryptase, can modify the microenvironment in human tissues with regard to neurotrophin actions."
https://openalex.org/W2141817891,"Nogo-66 receptor 1 (NgR1) is a glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored receptor for myelin-associated inhibitors that restricts plasticity and axonal regrowth in the CNS. NgR1 is cleaved from the cell surface of SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells in a metalloproteinase-dependent manner; however, the mechanism and physiological consequence of NgR1 shedding have not been explored. We now demonstrate that NgR1 is shed from multiple populations of primary neurons. Through a loss-of-function approach, we found that membrane-type matrix metalloproteinase-3 (MT3-MMP) regulates endogenous NgR1 shedding in primary neurons. Neuronal knockdown of MT3-MMP resulted in the accumulation of NgR1 at the cell surface and reduced the accumulation of the NgR1 cleavage fragment in medium conditioned by cortical neurons. Recombinant MT1-, MT2-, MT3-, and MT5-MMPs promoted NgR1 shedding from the surface of primary neurons, and this treatment rendered neurons resistant to myelin-associated inhibitors.

We aimed to detect TSP50 expression in CRC, correlate it with clinicopathological factors, and assess its potential diagnostic and prognostic value.TSP50 mRNAs and proteins were detected in 7 CRC cell lines and 8 CRC specimens via RT-PCR and Western blot analysis. Immunohistochemical analysis of TSP50, p53 and carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) with tissue microarrays composed of 95 CRCs, 20 colorectal adenomas and 20 normal colorectal tissues were carried out and correlated with clinicopathological characteristics and disease-specific survival for CRC patients. There was no significant correlation between the expression levels of TSP50 and p53 (P = 0.751) or CEA (P = 0.663). Abundant expression of TSP50 protein was found in CRCs (68.4%) while it was poorly expressed in colorectal adenomas and normal tissues (P<0.0001). Thus, CRCs can be distinguished from them with high specificity (92.5%) and positive predictive value (PPV, 95.6%). The survival of CRC patients with high TSP50 expression was significantly shorter than that of the patients with low TSP50 expression (P = 0.010), specifically in patients who had early-stage tumors (stage I and II; P = 0.004). Multivariate Cox regression analysis indicated that high TSP50 expression was a statistically significant independent risk factor (hazard ratio = 2.205, 95% CI = 1.214-4.004, P = 0.009).Our data demonstrate that TSP50 is a potential effective indicator of poor survival for CRC patients, especially for those with early-stage tumors."
https://openalex.org/W2061370635,"Calcium carbonate exists in two main forms, calcite and aragonite, in the skeletons of marine organisms. The primary mineralogy of marine carbonates has changed over the history of the earth depending on the magnesium/calcium ratio in seawater during the periods of the so-called ""calcite and aragonite seas."" Organisms that prefer certain mineralogy appear to flourish when their preferred mineralogy is favored by seawater chemistry. However, this rule is not without exceptions. For example, some octocorals produce calcite despite living in an aragonite sea. Here, we address the unresolved question of how organisms such as soft corals are able to form calcitic skeletal elements in an aragonite sea. We show that an extracellular protein called ECMP-67 isolated from soft coral sclerites induces calcite formation in vitro even when the composition of the calcifying solution favors aragonite precipitation. Structural details of both the surface and the interior of single crystals generated upon interaction with ECMP-67 were analyzed with an apertureless-type near-field IR microscope with high spatial resolution. The results show that this protein is the main determining factor for driving the production of calcite instead of aragonite in the biocalcification process and that -OH, secondary structures (e.g. α-helices and amides), and other necessary chemical groups are distributed over the center of the calcite crystals. Using an atomic force microscope, we also explored how this extracellular protein significantly affects the molecular-scale kinetics of crystal formation. We anticipate that a more thorough investigation of the proteinaceous skeleton content of different calcite-producing marine organisms will reveal similar components that determine the mineralogy of the organisms. These findings have significant implications for future models of the crystal structure of calcite in nature."
https://openalex.org/W2009701280,"We have demonstrated that SlyA activates fimB expression and hence type 1 fimbriation, a virulence factor in Escherichia coli. SlyA is shown to bind to two operator sites (OSA1 and OSA2), situated between 194 and 167 base pairs upstream of the fimB transcriptional start site. fimB expression is derepressed in an hns mutant and diminished by a slyA mutation in the presence of H-NS only. H-NS binds to multiple sites in the promoter region, including two sites (H-NS2 and H-NS3) that overlap OSA1 and OSA2, respectively. Mutations that disrupt either OSA1 or OSA2 eliminate or reduce the activating effect of SlyA but have different effects on the level of expression. We interpret these results as reflecting the relative competition between SlyA and H-NS binding. Moreover we show that SlyA is capable of displacing H-NS from its binding sites in vitro. We suggest SlyA binding prevents H-NS binding to H-NS2 and H-NS3 and the subsequent oligomerization of H-NS necessary for full inhibition of fimB expression. In addition, we show that SlyA activates fimB expression independently of two other known regulators of fimB expression, NanR and NagC. It is demonstrated that the rarely used UUG initiation codon limits slyA expression and that low SlyA levels limit fimB expression.

Like many cell surface virulence factors, type 1 fimbriation is controlled by phase variation that produces a mixture of expressing (fimbriate) and non-expressing (afimbriate) bacteria. Phase variation of type 1 fimbriation in E. coli requires the site-specific inversion of a short (∼300 bp) segment of DNA (fimS) that contains a promoter for the fimbrial structural operon (8Abraham J.M.

Whereas FimB promotes low frequency (<10−2 per cell per generation) phase switching in either direction, FimE can generate rates of fimbriate to afimbriate switching as high as 0.8 per cell per generation (13Blomfield I.C.

The expression of both fimB and fimE, as well as the inversion itself, are controlled by multiple signals including the availability of the branched chain amino acids and alanine, temperature, sialic acid (Neu5Ac), and N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) (15Gally D.L.

In addition to the signals noted above, fimB expression, and hence type 1 fimbriation, is also enhanced by the alarmones guanosine tetra- and pentaphosphate ((p)ppGpp) 2The abbreviations used are: ppGppguanine tetraphosphateEIECenteroinvasive E. coliNagCN-acetylglucosamine 6P-responsive. (18Aberg A. Shingler V. Balsalobre C. Mol Microbiol. 2006; 60: 1520-1533Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The response to many of the signals described above should decrease the fimbriate cell population during host inflammation, and we have proposed the raison d'être for the regulation observed in E. coli K-12 is to help balance the host-parasite interaction (16El-Labany S.

The MarR-family member SlyA was originally identified as a regulator of virulence in Salmonella, where it is required for intracellular survival and systemic pathogenesis (22Fass E. Groisman E.A. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 2009; 12: 199-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). SlyA is also found in E. coli where it was first shown to activate expression of the cryptic hemolysin gene hlyE (also known as clyA or sheA) (23Oscarsson J. Mizunoe Y. Uhlin B.E. Haydon D.J. Mol Microbiol. 1996; 20: 191-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Proteomic analysis of the SlyA regulons of enteroinvasive E. coli (EIEC) and Salmonella revealed that SlyA positively or negatively controls the expression of over 30 proteins in each bacterium (24Spory A. Bosserhoff A. Rhein C. von Goebel W. Ludwig A. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 3549-3559Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). This study, together with more recent work (25Navarre W.W. Halsey T.A.

Perhaps surprisingly, all of the SlyA regulon members identified in EIEC, including those involved in heat and acid stress responses and a variety of metabolic functions, are also found in E. coli K-12. However, SlyA has also been shown to activate expression of the K5 capsule, which is a virulence factor in UPEC (26Whitfield C. Annu. Rev.

Notwithstanding these differences between the SlyA regulons of E. coli and Salmonella noted above, in all cases where the mechanism of SlyA control has been characterized in detail, SlyA regulates gene expression by interacting with the abundant nucleoid-associated protein H-NS (27Corbett D.

However while SlyA antagonizes H-NS repression of the majority of genes which it activates in both E. coli and Salmonella, remodeling of the H-NS nucleoprotein complex facilitates activation of K5 capsule in E. coli (27Corbett D.

Here we show that SlyA antagonizes the inhibitory effect of H-NS on fimB expression. SlyA is thus a novel activator of type 1 fimbriation in E. coli.

Media used included L broth (5 g of sodium chloride (Fisher Scientific), 5 g of yeast extract (Oxoid), and 10 g of tryptone (Becton-Dickinson & Co.) per liter) and L agar (L broth with 1.5% agar (Difco)). Sucrose agar used to select recombinant bacteria following allelic exchange was L agar supplemented with 6% sucrose in the absence of sodium chloride (33Blomfield I.C. Vaughn V. Rest R.F. Eisenstein B.I. Mol. Microbiol. 1991; 5: 1447-1457Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). The antibiotics chloramphenicol (25 μg/ml), tetracycline (10 μg/ml) and kanamycin (25 μg/ml) were included in selective media as required. Minimal MOPS medium was prepared as described by Neidhardt et al. (34Neidhardt F.C. Bloch P.L. Smith D.F. J. Bacteriol. 1974; 119: 736-747Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), supplemented with 10 mm thiamine and 0.4% glycerol (Fisher Scientific). To prepare rich-defined medium, minimal MOPS medium was further supplemented with bases, vitamin B supplement and amino acids as originally reported (34Neidhardt F.C. Bloch P.L. Smith D.F. J. Bacteriol. 1974; 119: 736-747Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Liquid cultures were grown aerobically at 37 °C, and culture densities were monitored spectrophotometrically at 420 or 600 nm. fimB expression was measured using a FimB-LacZ fusion situated in the chromosome at fim as described previously (16El-Labany S.

Mutant fim regulatory alleles used in this study, including scanning-replacement mutations in which adjacent segments of the fimB promoter were replaced by 14–15 bp of heterologous DNA, were cloned into derivatives of the temperature-sensitive vector pMAK705 (32Hamilton C.M. Aldea M. Washburn B.K. Babitzke P. Kushner S.R. J.

Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, New York1972Google Scholar), following growth in either rich defined or minimal medium at 37 °C with rapid aeration to an A600 of 0.2. Experiments were repeated at least twice, and the values shown represent the mean of at least four samples with 95% confidence intervals included for each value. FimB recombination was measured as described previously (15Gally D.L. Bogan J.A. Eisenstein B.I. Blomfield I.C. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 6186-6193Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Bacteria were first plated onto lactose-MacConkey indicator medium to isolate phase OFF colonies. A single colony was subsequently inoculated into RD media, and grown at 37 °C to an A420 of ∼0.1. The cells were then diluted into 25 tubes to a density of ∼0.3 cells per tube, and grown for ∼22 generations at 37 °C with rapid aeration. The proportion of phase ON to phase OFF cells was determined by plating samples of the culture (5–7 duplicates) onto lactose-MacConkey indicator medium. The values shown represent the average obtained, together with the minimum and maximum. Cultures of E. coli strain BL21(DE3) containing slyA-pGS21a (GST-His-tagged SlyA overexpression plasmid constructed by GenScript) were grown in LB supplemented with 125 μg/ml ampicillin, shaking at 200 rpm at 37 °C. To overexpress the GST-His-tagged SlyA fusion protein, isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside was added to the cultures to a final concentration of 1 mm when the cultures reached an A600 of 0.6. Following a further 3 h of incubation, the cultures were cooled on ice for 10 min, and the cells were then pelleted by centrifugation at 8000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. Cell pellets were frozen at −20 °C and then resuspended in Lysis Buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, 2 mm EDTA, pH 8.0). Lysozyme (100 μg/ml) and Triton X-100 (0.1%) were added and the mixture was incubated for 20 min at room temperature. For DNase I treatment, MgCl2 (10 mm) and DNase I (20 μg/ml) were added, and samples were incubated at room temperature for a further 30 min, or until the viscosity was reduced. Supernatant was collected by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C prior to loading onto a glutathione-Sepharose 4B column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated with Binding Buffer (140 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 10 mm Na2HPO4, 1.8 mm KH2PO4, pH 7.3). The column was then washed with 5 column volumes of Binding Buffer three times. The GST-His-tagged SlyA was eluted by adding 0.5 ml of Elution Buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, 0.25 m NaCl, 10 mm reduced glutathione, pH 8.0) per ml bed volume of glutathione-Sepharose 4B. Fractions enriched for GST-His-tagged SlyA were pooled and dialyzed against 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. The GST-His tag was removed by cleavage with His-tagged recombinant tobacco etch virus protease (Promega). The cleavage reaction was applied to a Nickel affinity column and tag-free SlyA was eluted with a 50 mm imidazole solution (50 mm imidazole, Tris-HCl 50 mm, 0.25 m NaCl, pH 8.0). Purified SlyA was finally dialyzed against 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. 1.5 mg of purified SlyA protein was prepared for antibody generation at Eurogentec. After immunization of 2 rabbits with 4 injections each during 28 days (Speedy polyclonal packages), preimmune, medium, and final bleeds were collected. The final bleed serum only was used for Western blot analysis. For Western blot analysis, E. coli strains were grown in rich defined or minimal media with rapid aeration to reach an A600 of 0.2. Cells were cooled on ice for 10 min, pelleted by centrifugation at 8000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, and then lysed and treated with DNase I as described above. After centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, the supernatant of cell lysates was collected, and the concentration of total protein was determined by the Bradford method. 68.5 ng of purified SlyA and 62 μg of total protein from cell extracts were subjected to sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) using 5% stacking and 17.5% separating gels. The proteins were transferred from the gel onto polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (PVDF, Millipore) for 1 h by using a current of 0.15–0.20 A. The membrane was blocked by incubation with 5% Dried Skimmed Milk in PBS/T (phosphate-buffered saline + 0.2% Tween 20) for 40 min at room temperature, then incubated with primary antibody (1:1000 rabbit serum) for 1 h at room temperature. After three washes with PBS/T, the membrane was incubated with secondary antibody (1:5000 goat anti-rabbit IgG-peroxidase, Sigma-Aldrich) for 30 min at room temperature, and again washed three times with PBS/T. Proteins were visualized with enhanced chemiluminescence. Western blot films were scanned and processed using ImageJ to quantify SlyA. The plot area of SlyA bands of each strain were measured and compared with the purified SlyA plot area. The number of SlyA dimers were estimated by comparing the total weight of protein per E. coli cell (0.156 pg in rich-defined medium and 0.45 pg in minimal medium as reported by Bremer and Dennis (37Bremer H. Dennis P.P. Neidhardt F.C. Curtiss I.R. Ingraham J.L. Lin E.C.C. Low K.B. Magasani B. Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium: Cellular and Molecular Biology. Vol 2. American Society for Microbiology, Washington D. C.1996: 1553-1566Google Scholar)) to the weight of a SlyA dimer (0.543 × 10−7 pg). Plasmid DNA was isolated with a kit from Qiagen. Restriction and DNA modifying enzymes were purchased from either Promega or New England Biolabs. PWO DNA polymerase used in PCR reactions was obtained from Roche. PCR and restriction endonuclease digestions were carried out according to the manufacturers' recommendations. Deletion and replacement mutations were constructed using standard PCR techniques (38Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley and Sons, New York1987Google Scholar) and/or restriction endonuclease digestions, and used to replace wild type sequences cloned into derivatives of the temperature-sensitive vector, pMAK705 (32Hamilton C.M. Aldea M. Washburn B.K. Babitzke P. Kushner S.R. J. Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 4617-4622Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Replacement mutations rm21–35, 14–17 bp in length, each contained a SacII restriction endonuclease site (5′-CCGCGG). Replacement mutations rm39–41, 12 bp in length, were identical and contained a BsiWI restriction endonuclease site (5′-CGTACG). DNA sequencing was performed by Lark Technologies/Cogenics (now Beckman Coulter Genomics). Kanamycin resistance cassettes of Keio collection origin (39Baba T. Ara T. Hasegawa M. Takai Y. Okumura Y.

Sci. U.S.A. 2000; 97: 6640-6645Crossref PubMed Scopus (11205) Google Scholar). All other molecular genetic procedures were carried out according to standard protocols (38Ausubel F.M. Brent R.

Purified tag-free SlyA was produced by GenScript, and H-NS was obtained as a generous gift from Sylvie Rimsky. The fim DNA fragment used in EMSA was generated using primers EMSAfim03f (5′-CCCGGATCCGTAGTGACCAAAGC) and EMSAfim03r (5′-CCCGTCGACATAAAAAATTCAGC). A positive control for SlyA experiments containing slyA promoter DNA was generated using primers slyAf3 (5′-CCCCGGATCCTGACGGTAACCAAATGCAGCAATACATTTG) and EMSAsly01r (5′-CCCGTCGACGATGGTCTATCAGAGCACG), spanning the region reported to contain a SlyA binding site (27Corbett D.

A negative control was amplified from pBluescript as previously reported (21Xie Y. Yao Y. Kolisnychenko V. Teng C.H. Kim K.S. Infect Immun. 2006; 74: 4039-4047Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Polyacrylamide gels were cast containing 5% acrylamide (Bio-Rad) and 2% glycerol (Fisher Scientific). Reaction buffer contained 10 mm Tris (Fisher Scientific) pH 9.0, 50 mm KCl (Fisher Scientific), and 0.1% Triton X-100, as used previously (42Stapleton M.R. Norte V.A. Reads R.C. Green J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 17630-17637Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Reactions were carried out in a final volume of 10 μl. Each DNA fragment was incubated at a final concentration of 11 nm with varying concentrations of SlyA or H-NS for 10 min, before addition of 2 μl of loading buffer (40% sucrose, 35 mm Tris, pH 8.0). Electrophoresis was immediately carried out in 1× TBE at 160 V before staining for 15 min in 0.5 μg/ml ethidium bromide. The fim03 fragment (Fig. 1) was made by PCR with either the fim03f or fim03r oligonucleotide labeled by [γ-32P]ATP and polynucleotide kinase. DNase footprinting was carried out in two different buffers: the H-NS buffer described by Bouffartigues et al. (43Bouffartigues E. Buckle M. Badaut C. Travers A. Rimsky S. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2007; 14: 441-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar) (2007) 40 mm Hepes, 60 mm potassium glutamate, pH 8.0, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.05% Nonidet P40, 5 mm DTT, 0.5 mg/ml BSA, and the “SlyA” buffer described by Zhao et al. (44Zhao G. Weatherspoon N. Kong W. Curtiss 3rd, R. Shi Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 20924-20929Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) 10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 10 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 5 mm DTT, 5% glycerol, 0.5 mg/ml BSA. Complexes were formed at 25 °C in a final volume of 40 μl and DNase attack was carried out for generally 1 min with a final concentration of 50 ng/ml DNaseI. H-NS protects DNA from DNaseI and digestion times were increased in the presence of >100 nm H-NS. Reactions were stopped with 100 μl of aqua phenol pH 8.0 and 200 μl of 0.4 m sodium acetate (pH 5.0) 2.5 mm EDTA, 10 μg/ml sonicated herring sperm DNA was added. The digested DNA was phenol extracted, ethanol precipitated, and separated on 6% denaturing acrylamide gels. The radioactive gels were analyzed by phosphoimagery. The size marker is pBR322 DNA digested with MspI (New England Biolabs) and labeled with [γ-32P]ATP and polynucleotide kinase. A set of adjacent scanning-replacement mutations, extending from −38 to −184 bp upstream of the fimB transcription start site, were constructed and characterized in a chromosomal FimB-LacZ protein fusion background. This was initially carried out as part of an analysis of how the regulators NanR and NagC activate fimB expression (45Sohanpal B.K. Friar S. Roobol J. Plumbridge J.A. Blomfield I.C. Mol. Microbiol. 2007; 101: 16322-16327Google Scholar). Whereas none of these mutations affected the responses to NanR or NagC (data not shown), the first two adjacent mutations (rm21 and rm22; Fig. 1) did diminish fimB expression (Fig. 2A). The nucleotide sequence mutated in rm21 and rm22 contains a close match (5′-TTAGCATGATAA; hereafter called OSA1; boxed in Fig. 1B) to a consensus recognition sequence for the transcriptional regulator SlyA (5′-TTAGCAAGCTAA (42Stapleton M.R. Norte V.A. Reads R.C. Green J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 17630-17637Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar)), suggesting that SlyA might be an activator of fimB expression. To test this hypothesis, the ΔslyA mutation of the Keio collection (39Baba T. Ara T. Hasegawa M. Takai Y. Okumura Y. Baba M. Datsenko K.A. Tomita M. Wanner B.L. Mori H. Mol. Syst. Biol. 2006; 2: 2006-2008Crossref Scopus (5416) Google Scholar) was transduced into the FimB-LacZ fusion. It was found that expression of the fusion was diminished almost 4-fold in the mutant background following growth in rich-defined MOPS glycerol medium (Fig. 2). Moreover, in contrast to NanR and to NagC (data not shown), rm21 and rm22 had little effect on fimB expression in the absence of SlyA (Fig. 2A). In a control experiment it was also found that the effect of the ΔslyA mutation on fimB expression was complemented by an ectopic copy of slyA placed in the chromosome at lac. This construct (lacUV5-slyAUUG) included the slyA open reading frame, together with 65 bp of upstream DNA, placed downstream of the lacZYA promoter (Fig. 2B). To determine whether SlyA binds to the putative operator OSA1, the interaction of SlyA with the fimB promoter region was investigated by EMSA and DNase I footprinting (Fig. 3). For this analysis, a 297-bp PCR product that includes 282 bp of fim sequences, extending from −45 to −327 bp upstream of the fimB transcriptional start site (Fig. 1) was used. In EMSA, SlyA produced a loss of the free fim DNA, whereas it had no effect on the pBluescript DNA negative control as expected (27Corbett D. Bennett H.J. Askar H. Green J. Roberts I.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 33326-33335Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3A). SlyA also bound to its own promoter as expected from previous work (27Corbett D. Bennett H.J. Askar H. Green J. Roberts I.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 33326-33335Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 42Stapleton M.R. Norte V.A. Reads R.C. Green J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 17630-17637Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) (data not shown). However, SlyA produced only a faint discrete mobility-shifted band with either the fim (arrow in Fig. 3A) or slyA substrates. In repeat experiments, between 16 and 27 nm SlyA dimer was required to diminish the amount of the free fim DNA by 50% (not shown). DNase I footprinting demonstrated that SlyA bound to a region of DNA ∼40 bp long, spanning OSA1 and extending around 20 bp further upstream relative to the fimB transcriptional start site (Fig. 3B). A DNaseI hypersensitive site near position −161 appears to delimit the downstream protected region. Thus SlyA binds to OSA1 as predicted. The nucleotide sequence adjacent to OSA1contains a second potential SlyA operator site (5′-CTAGGGACCTA"

Previous studies found that mutations on the TPH2 locus in humans were associated with depression and studies of mice and studies of rhesus macaques have shown that the TPH2 locus was involved with aggressive behavior. We previously reported a functional single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the form of an amino acid substitution, Q468R, in the chimpanzee TPH2 gene coding region. In the present study we tested whether this SNP was associated with neuroticism in captive and wild-born chimpanzees living in Japan and Guinea, respectively. Even after correcting for multiple tests (Bonferroni p = 0.05/6 = 0.008), Q468R was significantly related to higher neuroticism (β = 0.372, p = 0.005). This study is the first to identify a genotype linked to a personality trait in chimpanzees. In light of the prior studies on humans, mice, and rhesus macaques, these findings suggest that the relationship between neuroticism and TPH2 has deep phylogenetic roots."
https://openalex.org/W2170947066,"Background Antiretroviral therapy for HIV-2 infection is hampered by intrinsic resistance to many of the drugs used to treat HIV-1. Limited studies suggest that the integrase inhibitors (INIs) raltegravir and elvitegravir have potent activity against HIV-2 in culture and in infected patients. There is a paucity of data on genotypic variation in HIV-2 integrase that might confer intrinsic or transmitted INI resistance. Methods We PCR amplified and analyzed 122 HIV-2 integrase consensus sequences from 39 HIV-2–infected, INI-naive adults in Senegal, West Africa. We assessed genetic variation and canonical mutations known to confer INI-resistance in HIV-1. Results No amino acid-altering mutations were detected at sites known to be pivotal for INI resistance in HIV-1 (integrase positions 143, 148 and 155). Polymorphisms at several other HIV-1 INI resistance-associated sites were detected at positions 72, 95, 125, 154, 165, 201, 203, and 263 of the HIV-2 integrase protein. Conclusion Emerging genotypic and phenotypic data suggest that HIV-2 is susceptible to the new class of HIV integrase inhibitors. We hypothesize that intrinsic HIV-2 integrase variation at “secondary” HIV-1 INI-resistance sites may affect the genetic barrier to HIV-2 INI resistance. Further studies will be needed to assess INI efficacy as part of combination antiretroviral therapy in HIV-2–infected patients."
https://openalex.org/W1991201681,"The TNF family cytokines BAFF (B-cell activating factor of the TNF family) and APRIL (a proliferation-inducing ligand) are crucial survival factors for B-cell development and activation. B-cell directed treatments have been shown to improve atopic eczema (AE), suggesting the involvement of these cytokines in the pathogenesis of AE. We therefore analyzed the expression of these TNF cytokines in AE, seborrheic eczema (SE) and healthy controls (HC). The serum/plasma concentration of BAFF, APRIL and a close TNF member TWEAK (TNF-like weak inducer of apoptosis) was measured by ELISA. The expression of these cytokines and their receptors in skin was analyzed by quantitative RT-PCR and immunofluorescence. Unlike other inflammatory diseases including autoimmune diseases and asthma, the circulating levels of BAFF, APRIL and TWEAK were not elevated in AE or SE patients compared with HCs and did not correlate with the disease severity or systemic IgE levels in AE patients. Interestingly, we found that the expression of these cytokines and their receptors was altered in positive atopy patch test reactions in AE patients (APT-AE) and in lesional skin of AE and SE patients. The expression of APRIL was decreased and the expression of BAFF was increased in eczema skin of AE and SE, which could contribute to a reduced negative regulatory input on B-cells. This was found to be more pronounced in APT-AE, the initiating acute stage of AE, which may result in dysregulation of over-activated B-cells. Furthermore, the expression levels of TWEAK and its receptor positively correlated to each other in SE lesions, but inversely correlated in AE lesions. These results shed light on potential pathogenic roles of these TNF factors in AE and SE, and pinpoint a potential of tailored treatments towards these factors in AE and SE."

Using a cell-free translation assay, we examined the mechanisms of translational repression of PUF proteins in the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We demonstrate that the poly(A)-binding protein Pab1p is required for PUF-mediated translational repression for two distantly related PUF proteins: S. cerevisiae Puf5p and Caenorhabditis elegans FBF-2. Pab1p interacts with oligo(A) tracts in the HO 3′-UTR, a target of Puf5p, to dramatically enhance the efficiency of Puf5p repression. Both the Pab1p ability to activate translation and interact with eukaryotic initiation factor 4G (eIF4G) were required to observe maximal repression by Puf5p. Repression was also more efficient when Pab1p was bound in close proximity to Puf5p. Puf5p may disrupt translation initiation by interfering with the interaction between Pab1p and eIF4G. Finally, we demonstrate two separable mechanisms of translational repression employed by Puf5p: a Pab1p-dependent mechanism and a Pab1p-independent mechanism.

https://openalex.org/W2102272295,"Background Our previous studies showed a down-regulation of GRIM-19 in primary human cervical cancers, and restoration of GRIM-19 induced tumor regression. The induction of tumor suppressor protein p53 ubiquitination and degradation by E6 oncoportein of high risk-HPV through forming a stable complex with E6AP is considered as a critical mechanism for cervical tumor development. The aims of this study were to determine the potential role of GRIM-19 in rescuing p53 protein and inducing cervical cancer cell apoptosis. Methodology/Principal Findings The protein levels of GRIM-19 and p53 were detected in normal cervical tissues from 45 patients who underwent hysterectomy for reasons other than neoplasias of either the cervix or endometrium, and cervical cancer tissues from 60 patients with non-metastatic squamous epithelial carcinomas. Coimmunoprecipitation and GST pull-down assay were performed to examine the interaction of GRIM-19 with 18E6 and E6AP in vivo and in vitro respectively. The competition of 18E6 with E6AP in binding GRIM-19 by performing competition pull-down assays was designed to examine the disruption of E6/E6AP complex by GRIM-19. The augment of E6AP ubiquitination by GRIM-19 was detected in vivo and in vitro ubiquitination assay. The effects of GRIM-19-dependent p53 accumulation on cell proliferation, cell cycle, apoptosis were explored by MTT, flow cytometry and transmission electron microscopy respectively. The tumor suppression was detected by xenograft mouse model. Conclusion/Significance The levels of GRIM-19 and p53 were concurrently down regulated in cervical cancers. The restoration of GRIM-19 can induce ubiquitination and degradation of E6AP, and disrupt the E6/E6AP complex through the interaction of N-terminus of GRIM-19 with both E6 and E6AP, which protected p53 from degradation and promoted cell apoptosis. Tumor xenograft studies also revealed the suppression of p53 degradation in presence of GRIM-19. These data suggest that GRIM-19 can block E6/E6AP complex; and synergistically suppress cervical tumor growth with p53."

Among them, Rapostlin/formin-binding protein 17 (FBP17) has attracted increasing attention as a critical coordinator of endocytosis. Here we found that Rapostlin was expressed in the developing rat brain, including the hippocampus, in late developmental stages when accelerated dendritic spine formation and maturation occur. In primary cultured rat hippocampal neurons, knockdown of Rapostlin by shRNA or overexpression of Rapostlin-QQ, an F-BAR domain mutant of Rapostlin that has no ability to induce membrane invagination, led to a significant decrease in spine density. Expression of shRNA-resistant wild-type Rapostlin effectively restored spine density in Rapostlin knockdown neurons, whereas expression of Rapostlin deletion mutants lacking the protein kinase C-related kinase homology region 1 (HR1) or Src homology 3 (SH3) domain did not. In addition, knockdown of Rapostlin or overexpression of Rapostlin-QQ reduced the uptake of transferrin in hippocampal neurons. Knockdown of Rnd2, which binds to the HR1 domain of Rapostlin, also reduced spine density and the transferrin uptake. These results suggest that Rapostlin and Rnd2 cooperatively regulate spine density. Indeed, Rnd2 enhanced the Rapostlin-induced tubular membrane invagination.

Regulation of cell morphology is one of the most important cellular processes in the development of various tissues, including brain. In studies about the mechanisms underlying the regulation of cell morphology, emphasis has been placed on proteins that are known to regulate the reorganization of actin cytoskeleton, such as Rho family small GTPases and their downstream effectors (1Hall A.

On the other hand, Rapostlin binds both N-WASP and dynamin through the C-terminal SH3 domain and recruits them to endocytic sites. N-WASP stimulates actin polymerization through the activation of the Arp2/3 complex (15Miki H. Takenawa T. J. Biochem. 2003; 134: 309-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 16Takenawa T.

In addition to the N-terminal F-BAR domain and the C-terminal SH3 domain, both of which PCH family members have in common, Rapostlin has an HR1 (protein kinase C-related kinase homology region 1, also referred to as acidic region) domain in the central region that mediates the interaction with a Rho family small GTPase Rnd2 (18Fujita H.

Rnd2 belongs to the Rnd subfamily of Rho family small GTPases that consists of Rnd1, Rnd2, and Rnd3/RhoE (19Nobes C.D. Lauritzen I. Mattei M.G. Paris S. Hall A. Chardin P. J.

Rnd3 antagonizes RhoA-mediated signaling pathways by inhibiting a RhoA effector, ROCK I (21Riento K. Guasch R.M. Garg R. Jin B. Ridley A.J. Mol.

Rnd1 and Rnd2 are predominantly expressed in brain, whereas Rnd3 is expressed ubiquitously (19Nobes C.D. Lauritzen I. Mattei M.G. Paris S. Hall A. Chardin P. J.

Spine morphogenesis is a critical step in the establishment of functional synaptic connections. Indeed, abnormal spine morphology is observed in several neurological diseases, such as mental retardation. In addition to extensively dissected cytoskeletal regulation of spine morphogenesis, growing evidence indicates that the endocytic and recycling pathways are also required for spine formation, although the underlying molecular mechanisms are far from being clear (37Cooney J.R.

Chem. 2002; 277: 45428-45434Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), although its physiological neural functions are largely unknown so far. In this study, we found that Rapostlin was strongly expressed in neurons in late developmental stages when accelerated spine formation occurs. Knockdown experiments in primary cultured hippocampal neurons showed that Rapostlin regulates spine development. We also found that Rnd2 promotes the membrane invaginating activity of Rapostlin and regulates spine formation. These results strongly suggest that Rapostlin and Rnd2 cooperatively regulate spine morphogenesis through the reorganization of the plasma membrane. The cDNA encoding wild-type rat Rapostlin (amino acids 2–620 of RapostlinL, the most abundant splicing variant of Rapostlin in brain, Ref. 41Kakimoto T. Katoh H. Negishi M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 14104-14110Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) was subcloned into the expression vector pcDNA3 (Invitrogen) or pCMV (Clontech, Mountain View, CA) containing a GFP or Myc epitope tag sequence at the amino terminus. The expression plasmid pCAG encoding YFP was a generous gift from Drs. J. Miyazaki (Osaka University, Osaka, Japan) and T. Saito (Chiba University, Chiba, Japan). The F-BAR domain mutant Rapostlin-QQ (K51Q, K52Q) was created by PCR-mediated mutagenesis. The cDNAs encoding Toca-1 and Rnd2 were obtained as described previously (42Katoh H. Harada A. Mori K.

The target sequences used for the shRNAs are as follows: Rapostlin shRNA-A, nucleotides 132–150, 5′-ACAGCTCAGGAATCTTTCA-3′ (45Tanaka H. Katoh H. Negishi M. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 10355-10364Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar); Rapostlin shRNA-B, nucleotides 419–437, 5′-GGTTTGAGCGGGACTGTAA-3′; and Rapostlin shRNA-C, nucleotides 945–963, 5′-GTCCAGAGGCAAGCTCTGG-3′. These were expressed using an shRNA expression vector pSilencer (Ambion, Inc., Austin, TX). The Rnd2 (Rnd2 shRNA-665) and firefly luciferase shRNA expression vectors were obtained as described previously (32Uesugi K. Oinuma I. Katoh H. Negishi M. J. Biol.

The shRNA-resistant wild-type Rapostlin and two deletion mutants of Rapostlin, ΔHR1 (amino acids 2–398 and 553–620) and ΔSH3 (amino acids 2–552), were subcloned into pEF-BOS with the Myc epitope tag sequence at the amino terminus. The shRNA-resistant mutants were created by PCR-mediated mutagenesis at six nucleotides in the Rapostlin shRNA-B targeting region, which did not change the amino acid sequence of Rapostlin. A rabbit polyclonal antibody for Rapostlin was raised against a bacterially expressed glutathione S-transferase-fused peptide corresponding to the amino acid residues 339–369 of rat Rapostlin (PPPPPPASASPSAVPNGPQSPKQQKEPLSHR). The specific antibody against Rapostlin was purified with a peptide-conjugated affinity column corresponding to the amino acid residues 354–369 of Rapostlin (CNGPQSPKQQKEPLSHR) or the amino acid residues 339–353 of Rapostlin (CPPPPPPASASPSAVP). A rabbit polyclonal antibody against Rnd2 was obtained as described previously (30Nakamura K. Yamashita Y. Tamamaki N. Katoh H. Kaneko T. Negishi M. Neurosci. Res. 2006; 54: 149-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The following antibodies were purchased from commercial sources: a rabbit polyclonal antibody against GFP (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR), a mouse monoclonal antibody against Myc (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA), a mouse monoclonal antibody against PSD-95 (Abcam, Inc., Cambridge, UK), a mouse monoclonal antibody against Tau-1 (Chemicon, Temecula, CA), a mouse monoclonal antibody against MAP2 (2a+2b) (Sigma-Aldrich), mouse monoclonal antibodies against β-actin and α-tubulin (Sigma-Aldrich), horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (DAKO, Denmark), Alexa Fluor 488- and 594-conjugated secondary antibodies (Molecular Probes, Inc.), and biotinylated donkey antibody against rabbit IgG (Chemicon). Immunoblotting was performed as described previously (41Kakimoto T. Katoh H. Negishi M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 14104-14110Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Briefly, proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and were electrophoretically transferred onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA). The membrane was blocked with 3% low-fat milk in Tris-buffered saline and then incubated with primary antibodies. The primary antibodies were detected with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies and a chemiluminescence detection kit (Chemi-Lumi One, Nacalai Tesque, Japan). Brains of Wistar rats were homogenized with a Teflon homogenizer in homogenizing buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 0.32 m sucrose, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 0.1 mm benzamidine, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) as described previously (23Ishikawa Y. Katoh H. Negishi M. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 11065-11072Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 43Kakimoto T. Katoh H. Negishi M. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 29042-29053Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The homogenates were lysed with Laemmli sample buffer and analyzed by immunoblotting. Immunohistochemistry was performed as described previously (48Katoh H. Fujimoto S. Ishida C. Ishikawa Y. Negishi M. Brain Res. 2006; 1073: 103-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Briefly, postnatal day 14 (P14) Wistar rats were anesthetized with chloral hydrate and perfused transcardially with a fixative containing 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 m phosphate buffer (pH 7.4). The brains were removed and postfixed in the fixative at 4 °C overnight. The brains were then saturated with 0.1 m phosphate buffer containing 30% sucrose at 4 °C. The brains were cut into 40-μm-thick coronal sections on a cryostat (CM3050 S, Leica, Nussloch, Germany) at −18 °C. Free-floating sections were treated with 1 mg/ml pepsin (DAKO) in 0.2 N HCl and then incubated at 4 °C overnight with the rabbit antibody against Rapostlin in PBS, containing 0.3% Triton X-100, 0.25% λ-carrageenan, and 0.5% normal donkey serum. After a rinse in PBS containing 0.3% Triton X-100, the sections were incubated for 1 h with a biotinylated donkey antibody against rabbit IgG. The sections were rinsed again and reacted for 1 h with avidin-biotin-peroxidase complex (Elite ABC kit, Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). After a wash of the sections in PBS, bound peroxidase was visualized by incubation with 0.02% 3,3′-diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride and 0.001% hydrogen peroxide in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6). HEK293T and HeLa cells were grown in DMEM containing 10% FBS, 4 mm glutamine, 100 units/ml of penicillin, and 0.1 mg/ml of streptomycin under humidified air containing 5% CO2 at 37 °C. HEK293T cells (1 × 106 cells) cultured on 60-mm culture dishes and HeLa cells (3 × 104 cells) cultured in 24-well plates on glass coverslips (circular, 13 mm in diameter) were transfected with test plasmids using Lipofectamine plus and Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen), respectively, according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cultured hippocampal neurons were prepared from the hippocampi of embryonic day 19 (E19) rats as described previously (23Ishikawa Y. Katoh H. Negishi M. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 11065-11072Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 24Ishikawa Y. Katoh H. Negishi M. Neurosci. Lett. 2006; 400: 218-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Briefly, hippocampi of Wistar rat embryos were dissected in ice-cold calcium- and magnesium-free Hanks' balanced salt solution. The hippocampi were washed in Hanks' balanced salt solution and incubated in Hanks' balanced salt solution with 0.25% trypsin and 0.1% DNase for 10 min at 37 °C. After the incubation, the hippocampi were washed in Hanks' balanced salt solution, followed by trituration with Pasteur pipettes. The cells were seeded onto poly-l-lysine-coated glass coverslips (circular, 13 mm in diameter) at a density of 3 × 104 cells in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% FBS, 4 mm glutamine, 100 units/ml of penicillin, and 0.1 mg/ml of streptomycin and cultured under humidified air containing 5% CO2 at 37 °C. After 5 h, the medium was replaced with neurobasal medium (Invitrogen) with 2% B27 supplement (Invitrogen), 0.5 mm glutamine, 50 units/ml of penicillin, and 0.05 mg/ml of streptomycin and cultured under humidified air containing 5% CO2 at 37 °C. For immunofluorescence analysis, hippocampal neurons were transfected with the indicated plasmids using Lipofectamine 2000. For immunoblot analyses, hippocampal neurons were cultured on poly-l-lysine-coated 35-mm culture dishes. Neurons were transfected with test plasmids using the rat neuron nucleofector kit (Amaxa Biosystems, Cologne, Germany) and lysed with Laemmli sample buffer at 8 DIV. Immunocytochemistry was performed as described previously (41Kakimoto T. Katoh H. Negishi M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 14104-14110Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 43Kakimoto T. Katoh H. Negishi M. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 29042-29053Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Primary cultured rat hippocampal neurons on coverslips were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS. HeLa cells on coverslips were fixed at 9 h after transfection. After residual paraformaldehyde had been quenched with 50 mm NH4Cl in PBS, cells were permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS and incubated with 10% FBS in PBS. Cells were incubated with the antibody against Myc or PSD-95 in PBS followed by incubation with an Alexa Fluor 594-conjugated goat antibody against mouse IgG in PBS. We used immunoreaction enhancer solutions (Can Get Signal Immunostain, Toyobo, Osaka, Japan) instead of PBS for dilution of Rapostlin antibody. Cells on coverslips were mounted on 90% glycerol containing 0.1% p-phenylenediamine dihydrochloride in PBS. Images were captured using a Nikon C1 laser scanning confocal imaging system equipped with a Nikon Eclipse TE2000-U microscope or a Leica DC350F digital camera system equipped with a Nikon Eclipse E800 microscope. For the transferrin uptake assay, hippocampal neurons were transfected with the indicated plasmids at 7 DIV using Lipofectamine 2000. At 10 DIV, neurons were starved for 6 h in B27 supplement-free neurobasal medium and incubated with 10 μg/ml transferrin conjugated to Alexa Fluor 594 (Molecular Probes, Inc.) for 10 min at 37 °C. After washing once with PBS, neurons were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS and mounted for analysis. For the TUNEL assay, hippocampal neurons were transfected with the indicated plasmids at 11 DIV using Lipofectamine 2000 and fixed at 15 DIV. The TUNEL assay was performed as described previously (49Fujimoto S. Negishi M. Katoh H. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2009; 20: 4941-4950Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Quantification of dendritic spines, axon morphology, and dendrite morphology in hippocampal neurons was performed as described previously (23Ishikawa Y. Katoh H. Negishi M. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 11065-11072Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 32Uesugi K. Oinuma I. Katoh H. Negishi M. J. Biol.

Res. 2008; 86: 3052-3061Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The number of dendritic spines was measured from confocal z-series YFP image stacks of the proximal segments of dendrites using ImageJ image analysis software (National Institutes of Health). A PSD-95-positive protrusion with a bulbous head wider than the base was scored as a spine. At least 15 neurons were collected per construct from three experiments, and spines were analyzed within dendritic segments of 100–200 μm in each neuron. Statistical significance of the difference between means was determined by t test. Quantification of fluorescence intensities of Alexa Fluor 594-transferrin was performed as described previously (39Thomas S. Ritter B. Verbich D. Sanson C. Bourbonnière L. McKinney R.A.

Relative fluorescence intensity was determined from the average fluorescence intensity of Alexa Fluor 594-transferrin in dendrites and the soma of YFP-positive neurons normalized to that of YFP-negative untransfected neurons in the same field. HeLa cells with membrane tubulation were counted as described previously (11Itoh T. Erdmann K.S. Roux A. Habermann B. Werner H. De Camilli P. Dev.

Ishikawa Y. Mori K. Negishi M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 45428-45434Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). To characterize the expression of Rapostlin protein in rat brains, we raised an antibody against Rapostlin that recognized Rapostlin overexpressed in HEK293T cells but did not cross-react with the close paralog Toca-1 (Fig. 1A) (43Kakimoto T. Katoh H. Negishi M. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 29042-29053Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Immunoblot analysis of rat brain lysates from E16 to adult using this antibody showed that the expression of endogenous Rapostlin protein in the brain was low during embryonic stages and gradually increased in postnatal days (Fig. 1B). The immunoreactivity was abolished by preabsorption of the antibody with antigenic peptide. The expression level of endogenous Rnd2 in brain also increased gradually in postnatal days (Fig. 1B). To further examine the distribution of Rapostlin in the developing brain, we performed immunohistochemistry using the Rapostlin antibody in the brain section prepared at P14. Expression of Rapostlin was observed in cortical neurons, hippocampal neurons, and cerebellar Purkinje cells with high intensity (Fig. 1C). No signal was detected after absorption of the primary antibody with an excess amount of antigen as a control (Fig. 1C and data not shown). This expression pattern was similar to that of Rnd2 mRNA (53Nishi M. Takeshima H. Houtani T. Nakagawara K. Noda T. Sugimoto T. Mol. Brain Res. 1999; 67: 74-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). We next prepared primary cultured rat hippocampal neurons and examined whether the expression levels of Rapostlin and Rnd2 were also increased in cultured neurons during development. Immunoblot analysis showed that expression of Rapostlin and Rnd2 was also increased during development in cultured hippocampal neurons (Fig. 1D). Immunocytochemical analysis in 15 DIV cultured hippocampal neurons with the Rapostlin antibody showed that Rapostlin was localized to both cell bodies and dendrites (Fig. 1E). T"

Mechanistic investigations have shown that, upon niacin activation, GPR109A couples to a Gi protein and inhibits adenylate cyclase activity, leading to inhibition of liberation of free fatty acid. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms for GPR109A signaling remain largely unknown. Using CHO-K1 cells stably expressing GPR109A and A431 cells, which are a human epidermoid cell line with high levels of endogenous expression of functional GPR109A receptors, we found that activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1 and 2 (ERK1/2) by niacin was rapid, peaking at 5 min, and was significantly blocked by pertussis toxin. Furthermore, time course experiments with different kinase inhibitors demonstrated that GPR109A induced ERK1/2 activation via the matrix metalloproteinase/epidermal growth factor receptor transactivation pathway at both early and later time points (2–5 min); this pathway was distinct from the PKC pathway-mediated ERK1/2 phosphorylation that occurs at early time points (≤2 min) in response to niacin. Overexpression of Gβγ subunit scavengers βARK1-CT and the Gα subunit of transducin led to a significant reduction of ERK1/2 phosphorylation, suggesting a critical role for βγ subunits in GPR109A-activated ERK1/2 phosphorylation. Using arrestin-2/3-specific siRNA and an internalization-deficient GPR109A mutant, we found that arrestin-2 and arrestin-3 were not involved in GPR109A-mediated ERK1/2 activation. In conclusion, our findings demonstrate that upon binding to niacin GPR109A receptors initially activate Gi, leading to dissociation of the Gβγ subunit from activated Gi, and subsequently induce ERK1/2 activation via two distinct pathways, one PKC-dependent pathway occurring at a peak time of ≤2 min and the other matrix metalloproteinase-dependent growth factor receptor transactivation occurring at both early and later time points (2–5 min).

Furthermore, time course experiments with different kinase inhibitors demonstrated that GPR109A induced ERK1/2 activation via the matrix metalloproteinase/epidermal growth factor receptor transactivation pathway at both early and later time points (2–5 min); this pathway was distinct from the PKC pathway-mediated ERK1/2 phosphorylation that occurs at early time points (≤2 min) in response to niacin. Overexpression of Gβγ subunit scavengers βARK1-CT and the Gα subunit of transducin led to a significant reduction of ERK1/2 phosphorylation, suggesting a critical role for βγ subunits in GPR109A-activated ERK1/2 phosphorylation. Using arrestin-2/3-specific siRNA and an internalization-deficient GPR109A mutant, we found that arrestin-2 and arrestin-3 were not involved in GPR109A-mediated ERK1/2 activation. In conclusion, our findings demonstrate that upon binding to niacin GPR109A receptors initially activate Gi, leading to dissociation of the Gβγ subunit from activated Gi, and subsequently induce ERK1/2 activation via two distinct pathways, one PKC-dependent pathway occurring at a peak time of ≤2 min and the other matrix metalloproteinase-dependent growth factor receptor transactivation occurring at both early and later time points (2–5 min)."

They are synthesized at the Golgi complex by a combination of glycosyltransferase activities followed by vesicular delivery to the plasma membrane, where they participate in a variety of physiological as well as pathological processes. Recently, a number of enzymes of ganglioside anabolism and catabolism have been shown to be associated with the plasma membrane. In particular, it was observed that CMP-NeuAc:GM3 sialyltransferase (Sial-T2) is able to sialylate GM3 at the plasma membrane (cis-catalytic activity). In this work, we demonstrated that plasma membrane-integrated ecto-Sial-T2 also displays a trans-catalytic activity at the cell surface of epithelial and melanoma cells. By using a highly sensitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay combined with confocal fluorescence microscopy, we observed that ecto-Sial-T2 was able to sialylate hydrophobically or covalently immobilized GM3 onto a solid surface. More interestingly, we observed that ecto-Sial-T2 was able to sialylate GM3 exposed on the membrane of neighboring cells by using both the exogenous and endogenous donor substrate (CMP-N-acetylneuraminic acid) available at the extracellular milieu. In addition, the trans-activity of ecto-Sial-T2 was considerably reduced when the expression of the acceptor substrate was inhibited by using a specific inhibitor of biosynthesis of glycolipids, indicating the lipidic nature of the acceptor. Our findings provide the first direct evidence that an ecto-sialyltransferase is able to trans-sialylate substrates exposed in the plasma membrane from mammalian cells, which represents a novel insight into the molecular events that regulate the local glycosphingolipid composition.

Our findings provide the first direct evidence that an ecto-sialyltransferase is able to trans-sialylate substrates exposed in the plasma membrane from mammalian cells, which represents a novel insight into the molecular events that regulate the local glycosphingolipid composition. Glycosphingolipids are amphipathic molecules consisting of a ceramide lipid moiety linked to a glycan chain of variable length and structure. Among these are found gangliosides, which are sialosylated glycosphingolipids mainly located in the outer layer of the plasma membrane of vertebrate cells (1Daniotti J.L. Iglesias-Bartolomé R. IUBMB Life. 2011; 63: 513-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 2Tettamanti G. Glycoconj.

Furthermore, gangliosides have been associated with a wide range of pathological processes, being receptors for both viruses and antibodies (7Iglesias-Bartolomé R. Trenchi A. Comín R. Moyano A.L.

J. 2006; 3: 26Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). The biosynthesis of gangliosides is mainly carried out in the lumen of the Golgi cisternae by a complex system of membrane-bound glycolipid acceptors, nucleotide sugar donors, glycosyltransferases, and nucleotide sugar transporters (1Daniotti J.L. Iglesias-Bartolomé R. IUBMB Life. 2011; 63: 513-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 9Maccioni H.J. J. Neurochem. 2007; 103: 81-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). These neosynthesized gangliosides move through the Golgi complex to the plasma membrane via the lumenal surface of transport vesicles (10Crespo P.M. Iglesias-Bartolomé R. Daniotti J.L. J. Biol.

It is very well documented that glycosphingolipid expression, including gangliosides, is mainly regulated at the transcriptional and posttranscriptional levels of glycolipid glycosyltransferases and specific transport proteins in the lumen of the Golgi complex. However, regulation of glycosphingolipid expression has also been demonstrated to occur at the plasma membrane, with the existence of a plasma membrane-associated sialidase (Neu3), β-hexosaminidase, β-glucosidase, and β-galactosidase (1Daniotti J.L. Iglesias-Bartolomé R. IUBMB Life. 2011; 63: 513-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 13Sonnino S. Aureli M. Loberto N. Chigorno V. Prinetti A. FEBS Lett. 2010; 584: 1914-1922Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) having been reported. In addition, we recently showed that both ectopically and endogenously expressed CMP-NeuAc:GM3 sialyltransferase (Sial-T2) 4The abbreviations used are: Sial-T2CMP-NeuAc:GM3 sialyltransferaseP4d,l-threo-1-fenyl-2-hexadecanoilamino-3-pirrolidino-1-propanol-HClCHOChinese hamster ovaryCMP-NeuAccytidine monophospho-N-acetylneuraminic acidGM3NeuAcα2,3Galβ1,4Glc-ceramideGD3NeuAcα2,8NeuAcα2,3Galβ1,4Glc-ceramide. are able to sialylate GM3 at the plasma membrane (cis-catalytic activity) by using both the exogenous and endogenous donor (CMP-NeuAc) and acceptor (GM3) substrates (14Crespo P.M.

Thus, the current scenario shows the presence of both ganglioside glycosyltransferases and glycohydrolases at the plasma membrane, which locally modulate cellular glycolipid expression and, consequently, different signaling processes.

In this work, we focused our attention on investigating if plasma membrane-integrated ecto-Sial-T2 displays a trans-catalytic activity in living cells. By using a specific ELISA combined with confocal fluorescence microscopy, we demonstrated that ecto-Sial-T2 was able to sialylate when GM3 was hydrophobically or covalently immobilized onto a solid surface (cell surface-matrix interaction). Furthermore, it was also observed that ecto-Sial-T2 displayed enzymatic activity on the GM3 substrate belonging to the surface of neighboring cells, which did not express endogenous Sial-T2 (cell-cell interaction). Interestingly, ecto-Sial-T2 was able to synthesize GD3 at the cell surface of adjacent cells by using both the exogenous and endogenous donor substrate (CMP-NeuAc) available at the extracellular milieu. Finally, the trans-activity of ecto-Sial-T2 was considerably reduced when the expression of the substrate was inhibited by using a specific inhibitor of biosynthesis of glycolipids, demonstrating the lipidic nature of the acceptor. Taken together, our findings provide the first direct evidence that an ecto-sialyltransferase is able to trans-sialylate substrates immobilized on a solid surface or expressed in membranes from mammalian cells, which represents a novel insight into the molecular events that regulate the local glycosphingolipid composition. CHO-K1 cell clones expressing different ganglioside glycosyltransferases had been obtained previously in our laboratory. The following cells were used: wild-type CHO-K1 (CHO-K1wt) cells (ATCC); clone 2 (CHO-K1Sial-T2+), a stable chick Sial-T2 (tagged at the C terminus with the YPYDVPDYA nanopeptide epitope of the viral HA) transfectant expressing the gangliosides GD3 and GT3 (6Zurita A.R. Maccioni H.J. Daniotti J.L. Biochem. J. 2001; 355: 465-472Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15Daniotti J.L. Martina J.A. Giraudo C.G. Zurita A.R. Maccioni H.J. J. Neurochem. 2000; 74: 1711-1720Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) and the SK-Mel 28 human melanoma cell line (ATCC), which endogenously expresses Sial-T2. Cells were grown and maintained at 37 °C in 5% CO2 in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS. GM3 was purified in our laboratory from dog erythrocytes. GD3 purified from chicken brain and glycolipids standards were kindly provided by G. Nores (Centro de Investigaciones en Química Biológica de Córdoba, Universidad Nacional de Córdoba, Argentina). The quality and purity of the gangliosides were assessed by chromatography on high performance thin-layer chromatography (HPTLC) plates (Merck) using chloroform:methanol:0.2% CaCl2 (55:45:10 v/v) as a solvent and revealed by orcinol staining. Different amounts of GM3 (50 and 100 pmol) or GD3 (0.75, 1.5, 3.0, and 6.0 pmol) were coated on polystyrene microtitration plates in methanol and dried overnight at 37 °C. After ganglioside coating, wells were saturated with PBS/2% BSA for 2 h. The reactivity to GD3 was measured using the specific mouse monoclonal antibody anti-GD3 (IgG3) clone R24 (ATCC no. HB-8445). After washes, primary R24 antibody was detected by incubating it overnight at 4 °C with mouse IgG antibody conjugated with HRP and diluted 1:1000 in PBS/2% BSA. After more washes, HRP activity was revealed using 0.5 mg/ml o-phenylenediamine in 0.1 m citrate-citric acid buffer (pH 5.5) containing 0.03% H2O2. The reaction was stopped by addition of H2SO4 (0.5 n final concentration), and the optic density (A) was measured at 490 nm in a microplate reader (Bio-Rad, model 680). The GD3 synthesis was calculated by subtracting the nonspecific GD3 binding from each measurement. The synthesis of GD3 by ecto-Sial-T2 activity was measured by ELISA using the specific mouse monoclonal antibody R24. First, GM3 (0.05 nmol) was coated onto polystyrene microtitration plates in methanol and dried overnight at 37 °C. Then, wells were saturated with PBS/2% BSA for 2 h. Also, cells from clone 2 (CHO-K1Sial-T2+) and SK-Mel 28 cells were grown on coverslips and treated for 5 days with 2.4 or 1.8 μm, respectively, of d,l-threo-1-fenyl-2-hexadecanoilamino-3-pirrolidino-1-propanol-HCl (P4) (Matreya, Inc., PA) to reduce GM3, GD3, and the neutral glycolipid content (16Crespo P.M. Zurita A.R. Daniotti J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 44731-44739Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). After treatment with P4, coverslips (6-mm diameter) containing 12,000 CHO-K1Sial-T2+ or SK-Mel 28 cells were placed in contact with wells coated with GM3 and incubated at 37 °C in an incubation system containing 10 mm MnCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 100 mm sodium cacodylate-HCl buffer (pH 6.5) and 30 μm CMP-NeuAc in a final volume of 70 μl DMEM. After 2 h of incubation, coverslips were removed and processed for confocal microscopy analysis. In addition, wells were washed thoroughly with PBS/1% BSA and incubated overnight with antibody to GD3 (R24) at 4 °C. After washes, primary R24 antibody was detected by ELISA as described above. The GD3 synthesis was calculated by subtracting the nonspecific GD3 binding from each measurement. 50 pmol of GM3 in methanol was coated onto the photo reactive Universal-BINDtm surface microtitration plates (Corning, Lowell, MA) and dried overnight at 37 °C. Covalent immobilization of GM3 to the polystyrene surface was made via abstractable hydrogen using UV illumination, resulting in a carbon-carbon bond. Then, wells were washed and saturated with PBS/2% BSA for 2 h. Next, CHO-K1Sial-T2+ cells previously grown on coverslips (6-mm diameter) and treated with P4 for 5 days were placed in contact with wells coated with GM3 and incubated at 37 °C for 90 min in an incubation system containing 10 mm MnCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 100 mm sodium cacodylate-HCl buffer (pH 6.5), and 30 μm CMP-NeuAc in a volume of 70 μl DMEM. After incubation, the coverslips were removed, and the GD3 synthesis was detected as described above. CHO-K1WT cells and CHO-K1Sial-T2+ were grown on 96-well polystyrene flat-bottom plates and coverslips (6 mm diameter), respectively, with or without P4 for 5 days. Then, CHO-K1Sial-T2+ cells treated with P4 were incubated “face-to-face” for 2 h at 37 °C with CHO-K1WT cells, previously treated or untreated with P4, in an incubation system containing 10 mm MnCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 100 mm sodium cacodylate-HCl buffer (pH 6.5), and 30 μm CMP-NeuAc in a volume of 80 μl of DMEM. Where indicated, CHO-K1WT cells were incubated for 90 min at 37 °C with CM from CHO-K1Sial-T2+ cells maintained in the incubation system indicated above. Next, the coverslips were removed, and the wells containing CHO-K1WT cells were washed and incubated with antibody to GD3 (R24) at 4 °C for 60 min. Then, cells were washed, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 20 min at room temperature and incubated at 4 °C with secondary antibody conjugated to HRP in PBS/2% BSA. After washes, HRP activity was revealed using 0.5 mg/ml o-phenylenediamine in 0.1 m citrate-citric acid buffer (pH 5.5) containing 0.03% H2O2. The reaction was stopped by addition of H2SO4 (0.5 n final concentration) and A was measured at 490 nm. The GD3 synthesis was calculated by subtracting the nonspecific GD3 binding (A value from a well containing CHO-K1wt cells treated with P4) from each measurement. The ecto-Sial-T2 activity was measured as recently described by Crespo et al. (14Crespo P.M. Demichelis V.T. Daniotti J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 29179-29190Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Briefly, CHO-K1Sial-T2+ cells were grown on coverslips and treated with 2.4 μm P4 for 4 days. Then, cells were incubated for 2 h with 25 μm GM3. Next, cells were washed repeatedly with 0.2% BSA in PBS to remove the GM3 and then incubated for 30 or 90 min in an incubation system containing 10 mm MnCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 100 mm sodium cacodylate-HCl buffer (pH 6.5), and 30 μm CMP-NeuAc in a volume of 30 μl of DMEM. Finally, coverslips were processed for immunodetection of the synthesized GD3 and confocal microscopy analysis. Cells grown on coverslips (12-mm diameter, 30,000 cells) were washed twice with PBS, incubated at 4 °C for 1 h with mouse monoclonal antibody anti-GD3 (R24) diluted 1:130, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 20 min at room temperature, and then incubated at 37 °C for 90 min with goat antibody to mouse IgG-Alexa488 diluted 1:1000 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., CA). After washes with PBS, cells were mounted in FluorSave reagent (Calbiochem, EMD Biosciences, La Jolla, CA). Confocal images were collected using a Carl Zeiss LSM5 Pascal laser-scanning confocal microscope (Carl Zeiss AG, Germany) or an Olympus FluoView FV300 confocal microscope (Olympus Latin America, Miami, FL) equipped with an argon/helium/neon laser and a ×63 (numerical aperture = 1.4) oil immersion objective (Zeiss Plan-Apochromat). Single confocal sections of 0.8 μm were taken parallel to the coverslip (xy sections). Final images were compiled with Adobe Photoshop 9.0. The confocal fluorescence micrographs shown in this manuscript are representative of at least three independent experiments. Many reports have described the significance of the regulation of the glycolipid metabolism at the plasma membrane (13Sonnino S. Aureli M. Loberto N. Chigorno V. Prinetti A. FEBS Lett. 2010; 584: 1914-1922Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 14Crespo P.M. Demichelis V.T. Daniotti J.L. J. Biol.

Neurochem. 2007; 103: 113-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). However, the possibility that ecto-Sial-T2 may catalyze the conversion of GM3, belonging to the surface of neighboring cells, to the ganglioside GD3 has not yet been described. To explore this hypothesis, we first set up a very sensitive and specific ELISA to detect GD3 using the monoclonal antibody R24. This assay allowed us to detect values lower than 0.8 pmol of disialoganglioside GD3 (Fig. 1). As expected, the ELISA signals were drastically decreased when the microtitration plates were coated with different amounts of GM3, which clearly indicated the specificity of R24 antibody binding (Fig. 1B). Next, we attempted to demonstrate trans-activity of ecto-Sial-T2 by using the ELISA procedure and following the experimental protocol described in Fig. 2A. Thus, CHO-K1 cells expressing Sial-T2 (CHO-K1Sial-T2+) were grown on coverslips and treated with P4 (a potent inhibitor of ceramide glucosyltransferase) for 5 days to reduce GM3, GD3, and the neutral glycolipid content (Fig. 2B, +P4, upper panel). Under these experimental conditions, ecto-Sial-T2 expression was even observed at the cell surface (Fig. 2B, lower panels) (14Crespo P.M. Demichelis V.T. Daniotti J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 29179-29190Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Next, P4-treated cells were washed and incubated at 37 °C for 150 min with GM3 (50 pmol) absorbed on polystyrene microtitration plates in a medium containing CMP-NeuAc, Mn+2, Mg+2, and P4 inhibitor. As shown in Fig. 2C (third column), we were able to detect a significant GD3 synthesis by ecto-Sial-T2 activity. On the other hand, GD3 synthesis was drastically reduced when P4-treated CHO-K1Sial-T2+ cells were incubated in a medium containing the bivalent cations (10 mm Mn+2 and 1 mm Mg+2) but without exogenous CMP-NeuAc (Fig. 2C, second column). A similar result was obtained when P4-treated CHO-K1Sial-T2+ cells were incubated in DMEM (culture medium containing 0.814 mm Mg+2) (Fig. 2C, first column). Additionally, the coverslips containing the cells that had been used in the different experimental conditions were fixed and processed for immunodetection of GD3 and later analysis by confocal fluorescence microscopy. As shown in Fig. 2C (lower panels), the fluorescent signal was under the limit of detection in all the conditions, with these results being similar to those obtained with P4-treated CHO-K1Sial-T2+ cells (Fig. 2B, +P4, upper panel). This suggests that GM3 was not taken and processed (addition of sialic acid moiety) in membranes from P4-treated CHO-K1Sial-T2+ cells. Instead, the results support the idea that synthesis of GD3 by ecto-Sial-T2 might have been occurring in immobilized GM3 on the solid surface. To study the trans-activity of ecto-Sial-T2 and to attempt to rule out the possibility of GM3 release from the microtitration plates with later uptake by the cells, we performed a chemical GM3 immobilization via the carbon-carbon bond using photo reactive Universal-BINDtm surface microtitration plates as described under “Experimental Procedures.” As shown in Fig. 2D (left columns), synthesis of GD3 was detected when P4-treated CHO-K1Sial-T2+ cells were incubated at 37 °C for 90 min with covalently immobilized GM3 in a medium containing bivalent cations (10 mm Mn+2 and 1 mm Mg+2) and exogenous CMP-NeuAc. On the other hand, GD3 synthesis was drastically reduced when P4-treated CHO-K1Sial-T2+ cells were incubated in a medium containing the bivalent cations (10 mm Mn+2 and 1 mm Mg+2) or incubated in DMEM only. Interestingly, the ELISA signals obtained from microtitration plates (without GM3) incubated with CHO-K1Sial-T2+ cells (-P4-GM3) or P4-treated CHO-K1Sial-T2+ cells (+P4-GM3) in DMEM were weak, indicating both the specificity of the detection and that GD3 from CHO-K1Sial-T2+ cells was not released and absorbed on the surface plates and therefore not significantly contributing to the positive signal in the studied experimental conditions (Fig. 2D, right columns). Similar results were obtained in ELISA assays using GM3 absorbed on the surface plate (results not shown). Taken together, these results further indicate that the addition of sialic acid residue on GM3 immobilized or absorbed on an artificial surface occurs via trans-sialylation, catalyzed by ecto-Sial-T2 expressed on the plasma membrane of CHO-K1Sial-T2+ cells. Next, we examined trans-sialylation catalyzed by the ecto-Sial-T2 expressed on the cell surface of SK-Mel-28 human melanoma cells, which endogenously synthesize the sialyltransferase and express the ganglioside GD3 (Fig. 3) (14Crespo P.M. Demichelis V.T. Daniotti J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 29179-29190Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 19Iglesias-Bartolomé R. Crespo P.M. Gomez G.A. Daniotti J.L. FEBS J. 2006; 273: 1744-1758Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). GD3 synthesis by ecto-Sial-T2 activity on the SK-Mel-28 cell surface was measured following essentially the same protocol as that described above for CHO-K1Sial-T2+ cells. When P4-treated SK-Mel-28 cells were incubated at 37 °C with immobilized GM3 in a medium containing only DMEM or bivalent cations in the absence of exogenous CMP-NeuAc, no appreciable synthesis of GD3 was observed (Fig. 3). As already seen in CHO-K1Sial-T2+ cells, the addition of exogenous CMP-NeuAc further increased the synthesis of disialoganglioside GD3 (Fig. 3). Several reports have described the secretion of active and proteolytically processed sialyltransferases in different cell types (15Daniotti J.L. Martina J.A. Giraudo C.G. Zurita A.R. Maccioni H.J. J. Neurochem. 2000; 74: 1711-1720Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 20Gross H.J. Merling A. Moldenhauer G. Schwartz-Albiez R.

Leukocyte Biol. 2008; 84: 1075-1081Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). In fact, we previously described that the secreted Sial-T2 present in the culture medium from CHO-K1Sial-T2+ cells grown for 48 h accounted for 8% of the total activity in vitro (15Daniotti J.L. Martina J.A. Giraudo C.G. Zurita A.R. Maccioni H.J. J. Neurochem. 2000; 74: 1711-1720Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Next, we attempted to investigate the contribution of soluble Sial-T2 in the catalytic conversion of GM3 (immobilized in the solid surface) to GD3. When GM3 coated polystyrene plates were incubated at 37 °C for 90 min with CM obtained from P4-treated SK-Mel-28 cells previously incubated with medium containing bivalent cations and exogenous CMP-NeuAc, no significant signal of GD3 synthesis was observed (Fig. 3, right column). This suggests that secreted and soluble Sial-T2 does not appreciably contribute to the addition of sialic acid residue in GM3 absorbed on the solid surface. Overall, the results shown in FIGURE 2, FIGURE 3 indicate that endogenously (SK-Mel-28 cells) and ectopically (CHO-K1Sial-T2+ cells) expressed Sial-T2 are able to exert trans-sialylation toward the gangliosides immobilized in an artificial matrix, thus leaving open the possibility of trans-sialylation by means of the substrate exposed on the cell surface of adjacent cells. We recently demonstrated by biochemical approaches, combined with confocal microscopy and flow cytometric analysis, the expression and cis-activity of ecto-Sial-T2 at the cell surface of epithelial and melanoma cells (14Crespo P.M. Demichelis V.T. Daniotti J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 29179-29190Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). In this study, these results were further confirmed and validated by using the very sensitive and specific ELISA procedure. CHO-K1Sial-T2+ cells were grown on 96-well polystyrene flat-bottom plates with P4 (+P4) or without P4 (-P4) for 5 days. Then, cells were incubated for 2 h with 30 μm GM3 before being washed and incubated in a medium containing CMP-NeuAc, Mn+2, and Mg+2 at 37 °C for 5, 10, 30, and 90 min in the presence of P4 inhibitor. As shown in Fig. 4A (right panel, black bars), GD3 synthesis was detected at the cell surface of P4-treated CHO-K1Sial-T2+ cells at 5 min and continued to rise, reaching a plateau at 30 min. Thus, these results indicate that Sial-T2 was able to use the exogenously incorporated acceptor (GM3) to catalytically convert it to disialoganglioside (GD3) in a fast process of sialylation at the cell surface. In contrast, a reduced amount of GD3 synthesis was seen when P4-treated CHO-K1Sial-T2+ cells were fed with GM3 and incubated in DMEM only (culture medium containing 0.814 mm Mg+2) (Fig. 4A, right panel, gray bars). As expected, P4-untreated cells showed high levels of GD3-immnoreactivity (Fig. 4A, left panel), and, interestingly, similar results were obtained by confocal fluorescence microscopy analysis. Cells grown on coverslips with P4 (+P4) were fed for 2 h with 30 μm GM3 before being washed and then incubated at the same conditions mentioned above, with GD3 synthesis being immunodetected using antibody R24 (Fig. 4B). Next, we attempted to evaluate whether ecto-Sial-T2 from CHO-K1Sial-T2+ cells was able to catalyze the transfer of sialic acid moiety to the GM3 ganglioside expressed on the plasma membrane from wild-type CHO-K1 cells (CHO-K1 WT, Sial-T2, and GD3-negative). Interestingly, the results showed a considerable increase in GD3 synthesis in CHO-K1WT cells after incubation face-to-face with P4-treated CHO-K1Sial-T2+ cells (grown on coverslips) for 2 h in a medium containing bivalent cations (10 mm Mn+2 and 1 mm Mg+2) and exogenous CMP-NeuAc (Fig. 5, third column, +P4+Mn+Mg+ CMP-NeuAc). In contrast, although a reduced amount of GD3 synthesis was detected in CHO-K1WT cells after incubation face-to-face with P4-treated CHO-K1Sial-T2+ cells in a medium containing only DMEM (Fig. 5, first column), a significant increase of GD3 synthesis was also observed in CHO-K1WT cells after incubation face-to-face with P4-treated CHO-K1Sial-T2+ in a medium containing bivalent cations in the absence of exogenous CMP-NeuAc (Fig. 5, second column). Furthermore, when the biosynthesis of glycolipids (including the substrate GM3) was inhibited in CHO-K1WT cells by P4 treatment, GD3 synthesis was drastically reduced in these cells after incubation with P4-treated CHO-K1Sial-T2+ cells in a medium containing bivalent cations or in an incubation system containing cations plus exogenous CMP-NeuAc (Fig. 5, fourth and fifth columns, respectively). Taken together, these results strongly suggest the existence of specific trans-sialylation catalyzed by ecto-Sial-T2, which was able to exert its enzymatic activity on the GM3 belonging to the surface of neighboring cells by using both the exogenous and endogenous donor substrate (CMP-NeuAc) available at the extracellular milieu. As already described above for SK-Mel-28 cells (Fig. 3), the incubation of CHO-K1WT cells, with conditioned medium from P4-treated CHO-K1Sial-T2+ cells previously incubated with medium containing bivalent cations and exogenous CMP-NeuAc, did not significantly enhance GD3 synthesis above the levels observed in control conditions (medium only or medium containing bivalent cations) (Fig. 5). Thus, this suggests that the secreted and soluble form of Sial-T2 from CHO-K1 cells did not make a significant contribution to the addition of sialic acid residue in GM3 from the surface of adjacent cells. Trans-sialylation catalyzed by ecto-Sial-T2 in CHO-K1 cells was further investigated by immunofluorescence and confocal microscopy analysis. The lack of expression of GD3 in wild-type CHO-K1 cells and the drastic reduction of GD3 synthesis in P4-treated CHO-K1Sial-T2+ cells is shown in Fig. 6A. GD3 synthesis at the cell surface of CHO-K1WT (previously labeled with the lipophilic fluorescent carbocyanine DiI dye) was low when incubated face-to-face with P4-treated CHO-K1Sial-T2+ cells for 90 min in DMEM (Fig. 6B, top row, +P4). However, a noticeable increase in GD3 synthesis at the cell surface of CHO-K1WT was observed when the cells were incubated in a complete system containing bivalent cations (10 mm Mn+2 and 1 mm Mg+2) and exogenous CMP-NeuAc (Fig. 6B, bottom row, +P4+Mg+Mn+ CMP-NeuAc), which is in complete agreement with results obtained by the ELISA procedure (Fig. 5). Additionally, these experiments also indicated that lipid transfer or leakage from CHO-K1WT to CHO-K1Sial-T2+ cells was very restricted because no significant DiI fluorescence was detected in CHO-K1Sial-T2+ cells (Fig. 6C). Therefore, the poor expression of GD3 at the surface of P4-treated CHO-K1Sial-T2+ cells (Fig. 6C, bottom row, +P4+Mg+Mn+ CMP-NeuAc) probably represents a reduced synthesis of GD3 that used the remaining amount of GM3 after P4 treatment. Ganglioside sialylation is a process that involves numerous Golgi-associated sialyltransferases which also contribute to diversity in the linkage and the chemical structure of sialic acid residues on the cell surface. Although ganglioside sialylation was first reported more than 30 years ago, the development of new molecular and biochemical approaches in recent years has produced a notable growth in information about the presence and significance of the sialyltransferases and glycohydrolases associated with the outer layer of the plasma membrane. In this sense, we recently demonstrated in epithelial and melanoma cells that Sial-T2 is able to sialylate GM3 at the plasma membrane by using both the exogenous and endogenous donor (CMP-NeuAc) and acceptor (GM3) substrates (14Crespo P.M. Demichelis V.T. Daniotti J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 29179-29190Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). In this work, we report for the first time that ecto-Sial-T2 expressed at the cell surface of CHO-K1 cells is able to sialylate GM3 ganglioside absorbed on an artificial surface using the exogenous donor CMP-NeuAc. Furthermore, ecto-Sial-T2 trans-activity was also detected when GM3 was covalently immobilized on a solid surface, thus discarding the possibility that GM3 could have been removed from the solid surface during the period of incubation and later modified by “cis” interaction with the enzyme expressed at the cell surface. All these observations were also confirmed using SK-Mel-28 human melanoma cells, which endogenously express Sial-T2 both at the Golgi complex and at the cell surface (14Crespo P.M. Demichelis V.T. Daniotti J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 29179-29190Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). More interestingly, we obtained strong experimental evidence indicating a specific trans-sialylation catalyzed by ecto-Sial-T2 that was able to exert its enzymatic activity on the GM3 belonging to the surface of neighboring cells (see simplified representation in Fig. 7). The highly sensitive (able to detect less than 0.8 pmol of disialoganglioside GD3) and specific ELISA employed in this study allowed us to observe GM3 cis-sialylation (Fig. 4) and trans-sialylation (Fig. 5) at 5–10 min and 90 min of incubation, respectively, which indicates a fast enzymatic process. Rapid cell surface sialylation was also reported in other cell types such as polymorphonuclear leukocytes, which express the sialidase and sialyltransferase activities that permit modulation of their surface sialylation and hence adhere to and migrate across the endothelium (22Rifat S. Kang T.J. Mann D. Zhang L. Puche A.C. Stamatos N.M. Goldblum S.E. Brossmer R. Cross A.S. J. Leukocyte Biol. 2008; 84: 1075-1081Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), or in human brain-derived TE671 cells, where there is a rapid GD3 synthesis and trafficking during amyloid β-induced apoptosis (23Kim J.K. Kim S.H. Cho H.Y. Shin H.S. Sung H.R. Jung J.R. Quan M.L. Jiang D.H. Bae H.R. J. Korean Med. Sci. 2010; 25: 1492-1498Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Thus, the fast transformation of GM3 to GD3 is in agreement with the hypothesis that enzymes such as sialyltransferases can act quickly and locally by modifying the pattern of glycolipids on the cell surface or the sialylating substrates expressed in membranes from neighboring cells in response to a range of dissimilar environmental stimuli. Several reports have described the secretion of active and proteolytically processed sialyltransferases into extracellular media of different cell types (15Daniotti J.L. Martina J.A. Giraudo C.G.

However, we report here that the secreted and soluble form of Sial-T2 does not make a significant contribution to the addition of sialic acid residue on GM3 immobilized on artificial surfaces or expressed at the surface of neighboring cells, which strongly suggests that sialylation is mainly mediated by ecto-Sial-T2 trans-activity. Moreover, the absence of GD3 synthesis by secreted sialyltransferase could be indicating differences in enzymatic parameters (i.e. in the enzyme acceptor or donor substrate specificity or affinity) between secreted Sial-T2 and ecto-Sial-T2 enzymes or that the amount of Sial-T2 released to the culture medium in the period of time used in our experimental conditions was insufficient to sialylate GM3. Nevertheless, we cannot discard that the local concentration of soluble Sial-T2 in tissues and intercellular spaces may be high enough to contribute to GD3 synthesis at the cell surface. Supporting the first assumption, we observed that the N-glycan processing status of cell surface-located Sial-T2 was different to that of the secreted form of Sial-T2 (14Crespo P.M. Demichelis V.T. Daniotti J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 29179-29190Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), which probably affects the enzymatic properties. On this regard, N-linked oligosaccharides in UDP-GalNAc:lactosylceramide/GM3/GD3 N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase (GalNAc-T) (24Haraguchi M. Yamashiro S. Furukawa K. Takamiya K. Shiku H. Furukawa K.

Ganglioside synthesis is highly regulated during cell differentiation, development, apoptosis, and oncogenic transformation, suggesting that gangliosides play a fundamental role in these processes. In particular, Sial-T2 and its enzymatic product GD3 are prevalently expressed at the early developmental stages of the central nervous system (for references, see Ref. 27Daniotti J.L. Landa C.A.

In recent years, GD3 has emerged as a cell death effector because of its role in apoptosis signaling in different cellular types by inducing mitochondrial damage (34Colell A. Morales A.

IUBMB Life. 2005; 57: 477-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). However, GD3 has also been reported to be overexpressed in a variety of tumors, especially in melanomas, where GD3 promotes tyrosine phosphorylation of paxillin, thereby resulting in an increased cell growth and an increased invasion by adhesion signals via integrin (36Hamamura K. Furukawa K. Hayashi T. Hattori T. Nakano J. Nakashima H. Okuda T. Mizutani H. Hattori H. Ueda M. Urano T. Lloyd K.O. Furukawa K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Recently, it was also suggested that the signal transduction in ganglioside GD3-enriched lipid microdomains is involved in the growth cone morphology of cerebellar granule cells (38Yuyama K. Sekino-Suzuki N. Yamamoto N. Kasahara K. J. Neurochem. 2011; 116: 845-850Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). The biological effects of gangliosides depend on their site of production and on the subsequent subcellular distribution. In this context, both the cis- and trans-activity of ecto-Sial-T2 emerge as potential levels of regulation of ganglioside composition (see the schematic representation in Fig. 7) which, unlike the biosynthetic machinery associated with the Golgi complex, might spatially and rapidly modulate the plasma membrane physicochemical properties by expression of GD3 and, consequently, the different cell signaling processes.

https://openalex.org/W2130057088,"In the present study, we discovered that mouse oocyte maturation was inhibited by simulated microgravity via disturbing spindle organization. We cultured mouse oocytes under microgravity condition simulated by NASA's rotary cell culture system, examined the maturation rate and observed the spindle morphology (organization of cytoskeleton) during the mouse oocytes meiotic maturation. While the rate of germinal vesicle breakdown did not differ between 1 g gravity and simulated microgravity, rate of oocyte maturation decreased significantly in simulated microgravity. The rate of maturation was 8.94% in simulated microgravity and was 73.0% in 1 g gravity. The results show that the maturation of mouse oocytes in vitro was inhibited by the simulated microgravity. The spindle morphology observation shows that the microtubules and chromosomes can not form a complete spindle during oocyte meiotic maturation under simulated microgravity. And the disorder of γ-tubulin may partially result in disorganization of microtubules under simulated microgravity. These observations suggest that the meiotic spindle organization is gravity dependent. Although the spindle organization was disrupted by simulated microgravity, the function and organization of microfilaments were not pronouncedly affected by simulated microgravity. And we found that simulated microgravity induced oocytes cytoplasmic blebbing via an unknown mechanism. Transmission electron microscope detection showed that the components of the blebs were identified with the cytoplasm. Collectively, these results indicated that the simulated microgravity inhibits mouse oocyte maturation via disturbing spindle organization and inducing cytoplasmic blebbing."

Twenty patients with extrahepatic portal vein thrombosis underwent 57 preoperative planning abdominal imaging studies. Two readers retrospectively reviewed these studies for an ability to confidently determine left portal vein (PV) patency, superior mesenteric vein (SMV) patency, and intrahepatic left and right PV contiguity. In this study, computed tomographic arterial portography allowed for confident characterization of left PV patency, SMV patency and left and right PV continuity in 100% of the examinations. Single phase contrast-enhanced CT, multi-phase contrast-enhanced CT, multiphase contrast-enhanced MRI, and transarterial portography answered all key diagnostic questions in 33%, 30%, 0% and 8% of the examinations, respectively. In conclusion, of the variety of imaging modalities that have been employed for Rex shunt preoperative planning, computed tomographic arterial portography most reliably allows for assessment of left PV patency, SMV patency, and left and right PV contiguity in a single study."
https://openalex.org/W2025442378,"Gene rearrangement occurs during development in some cell types and this genome dynamics is modulated by intrinsic and extrinsic factors, including growth stimulants and nutrients. This raises a possibility that such structural change in the genome and its subsequent epigenetic modifications may also take place during mammalian ontogeny, a process undergoing finely orchestrated cell division and differentiation. We tested this hypothesis by comparing single nucleotide polymorphism-defined haplotype frequencies and DNA methylation of the rDNA multicopy gene between two mouse ontogenic stages and among three adult tissues of individual mice. Possible influences to the genetic and epigenetic dynamics by paternal exposures were also examined for Cr(III) and acid saline extrinsic factors. Variables derived from litters, individuals, and duplicate assays in large mouse populations were examined using linear mixed-effects model. We report here that active rDNA rearrangement, represented by changes of haplotype frequencies, arises during ontogenic progression from day 8 embryos to 6-week adult mice as well as in different tissue lineages and is modifiable by paternal exposures. The rDNA methylation levels were also altered in concordance with this ontogenic progression and were associated with rDNA haplotypes. Sperm showed highest level of methylation, followed by lungs and livers, and preferentially selected haplotypes that are positively associated with methylation. Livers, maintaining lower levels of rDNA methylation compared with lungs, expressed more rRNA transcript. In vitro transcription demonstrated haplotype-dependent rRNA expression. Thus, the genome is also dynamic during mammalian ontogeny and its rearrangement may trigger epigenetic changes and subsequent transcriptional controls, that are further influenced by paternal exposures."
https://openalex.org/W2104192652,"The hypoxia-inducible transcription factor (HIF) is a key component of the cellular adaptation mechanisms to hypoxic conditions. HIFα subunits are degraded by prolyl-4-hydroxylase domain (PHD) enzyme-dependent prolyl-4-hydroxylation of LxxLAP motifs that confer oxygen-dependent proteolytic degradation. Interestingly, only three non-HIFα proteins contain two conserved LxxLAP motifs, including the putative RNA helicase with a zinc finger domain HELZ. However, HELZ proteolytic regulation was found to be oxygen-independent, supporting the notion that a LxxLAP sequence motif alone is not sufficient for oxygen-dependent protein destruction. Since biochemical pathways involving RNA often require RNA helicases to modulate RNA structure and activity, we used luciferase reporter gene constructs and metabolic labeling to demonstrate that HELZ overexpression activates global protein translation whereas RNA-interference mediated HELZ suppression had the opposite effect. Although HELZ interacted with the poly(A)-binding protein (PABP) via its PAM2 motif, PABP was dispensable for HELZ function in protein translation. Importantly, downregulation of HELZ reduced translational initiation, resulting in the disassembly of polysomes, in a reduction of cell proliferation and hypophosphorylation of ribosomal protein S6."
https://openalex.org/W2143784435,"Directional migration of adherent cells on an extracellular matrix requires repeated formation and disassembly of focal adhesions (FAs). Directional migration of adherent cells We have identified ZF21 as a regulator of disassembly of FAs and cell migration, and increased expression of the gene has been linked to metastatic colon cancer. ZF21 is a member of a protein family characterized by the presence of the FYVE domain, which is conserved among Fab1p, YOPB, Vps27p, and EEA1 proteins, and has been shown to mediate the binding of such proteins to phosphoinositides in the lipid layers of cell membranes. ZF21 binds multiple factors that promote disassembly of FAs such as FAK, β-tubulin, m-calpain, and SHP-2. ZF21 does not contain any other known protein motifs other than the FYVE domain, but a region of the protein C-terminal to the FYVE domain is sufficient to mediate binding to β-tubulin. In this study, we demonstrate that the C-terminal region is important for the ability of ZF21 to induce disassembly of FAs and cell migration, and to promote an early step of experimental metastasis to the lung in mice. In light of the importance of the C-terminal region, we analyzed its ternary structure using NMR spectroscopy. We demonstrate that this region exhibits a structure similar to that of a canonical pleckstrin homology domain, but that it lacks a positively charged interface to bind phosphatidylinositol phosphate. Thus, ZF21 contains a novel noncanonical PH-like domain that is a possible target to develop a therapeutic strategy to treat metastatic cancer."

Moreover, G2/M transition is associated with cell cycle-dependent turnover of Chfr accompanied by high autoubiquitylation activity, suggesting that regulation of Chfr levels and auto-ubiquitylation activity are functionally significant. To test this, we generated Chfr mutants Chfr-K2A and Chfr-K5A in which putative lysine target sites of auto-ubiquitylation were replaced with alanine. Chfr-K2A did not undergo cell cycle-dependent degradation, and its levels remained high during G2/M phase. The elevated levels of Chfr-K2A caused a significant reduction in phosphohistone H3 levels and cyclinB1/Cdk1 kinase activities, leading to mitotic entry delay. Notably, polo-like kinase 1 levels at G2 phase, but not at S phase, were ∼2–3-fold lower in cells expressing Chfr-K2A than in wild-type Chfr-expressing cells. Consistent with this, ubiquitylation of Plk1 at G2 phase was accelerated in Chfr-K2A-expressing cells.

The fact that Chfr is broadly inactivated in 15–50% of various human tumors through mutation and/or promoter hypermethylation has garnered considerable attention (7Corn P.G. Summers M.K. Fogt F.

A series of earlier studies has shown that the RING finger domain of Chfr, which confers E3 ligase activity, is required for its auto-ubiquitylation and subsequent checkpoint function (10Jackson P.K.

Wong J. Fang G. Methods Mol. Biol. 2004; 280: 229-243PubMed Google Scholar), which in turn stalls activation of cyclin B-associated Cdc2 kinase. However, other studies suggest that Chfr-mediated non-canonical signaling rather than proteasome-mediated destruction of target substrates is important in the response to mitotic stress (11Bothos J. Summers M.K. Venere M. Scolnick D.M. Halazonetis T.D. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 7101-7107Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 12Chaturvedi P. Sudakin V. Bobiak M.L. Fisher P.W. Mattern M.R.

Moreover, Plk1 expression in human cell lines does not always correlate with reduced Chfr levels (16Erson A.E. Petty E.M. Mol. Carcinog. 2004; 39: 26-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 17Summers M.K. Bothos J. Halazonetis T.D. Oncogene. 2005; 24: 2589-2598Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), suggesting that alternative pathways to modulate the Chfr checkpoint function may exist in mammals. Accordingly, ubiquitylation-mediated signaling and activation of downstream p38 kinase but not proteasome-dependent degradation by Chfr is reported to be necessary for the antephase checkpoint (18Matsusaka T. Pines J. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 166: 507-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) and exclusion of cyclin B1 from the nucleus by Chfr delays cell-cycle progression in response to microtubule damage (17Summers M.K. Bothos J. Halazonetis T.D. Oncogene. 2005; 24: 2589-2598Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Modification of Chfr activity by phosphorylation or ADP-ribosylation may also play a critical role in the checkpoint function of Chfr. Chfr undergoes phosphorylation by protein kinase B (PKB/Akt) upon DNA damage, and expression of a nonphosphorylatable mutant of CHFR results in reduction of levels of Plk1 and inhibition of mitotic entry (15Shtivelman E. Mol Cancer Res. 2003; 1: 959-969PubMed Google Scholar). Chfr has been identified as a novel poly(ADP-ribose)-binding zinc finger (PBZ) motif-containing protein (19Ahel I. Ahel D. Matsusaka T. Clark A.J. Pines J. Boulton S.J. West S.C. Nature. 2008; 451: 81-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). Introducing mutations in the PBZ motif of Chfr or inhibition of poly (ADP-ribose) synthesis leads to abrogation in its antephase checkpoint function. The contradictory findings and whether and/or how the reported regulations of Chfr expression level and activity are interconnected remain to be resolved. polo-like kinase calf intestinal phosphatase double thymidine block propidium iodide. Here, we have demonstrated that modulation of the Chfr expression level is the key factor determining its checkpoint function. We have shown that Chfr levels are elevated when the checkpoint is activated upon microtubule stress. In addition, cell cycle-dependent ubiquitylation and degradation of Chfr at G2 phase is crucial for mitotic entry. By utilizing a Chfr-K2A mutant lacking putative auto-ubiquitylation target sites, we have demonstrated that accumulation of Chfr protein at G2 phase, but not in S phase, promotes degradation of Plk1, leading to delayed entry into mitosis. Thus, our findings provide the first demonstration that Chfr auto-ubiquitylation activity and degradation are important for the cell cycle and checkpoint functions of Chfr. A full length of FLAG-tagged Chfr (p3xFLAG-Chfr) was used as the initial construct (13Kang D. Chen J. Wong J. Fang G. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 156: 249-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). To generate a FLAG-Chfr ΔRF mutant plasmid, Chfr cDNA lacking the 48 amino acids (EETLTCIICQDLLHDCVSLQPCMHTFCAACYSGWMERSSLCPTCRCPV) was subcloned into p3xFLAG-CMV-7.1 (Sigma). A FLAG-Chfr ΔCR mutant clone was generated by truncation of the C-terminal 190 amino acids. To establish mutants of FLAG-Chfr K2A, FLAG-Chfr K3A, and FLAG-Chfr K5A, PCR was performed using a primer set for FLAG-Chfr K3A (forward, 5′-AAATCTAGAACCAGTTGCTGCAGCTATGAGAGGTGGGGACCTTGA-3′; reverse, 5′-AAACCTAGGTCCTCCTGATCCTGGGGTTCCAACG-3′).PCR fragments were digested with XbaI and AfeI and inserted between AvrII and AfeI of FLAG-Chfr (WT). For FLAG-Chfr K2A, PCR was carried out using primer sets (forward, 5′-AAATCTAGAACCAGTTGCTGCAGCTATGAGAGGTGGGGACCTTGA-3′; reverse, 5′-GGCTGCAGCATGTCTTGAGTGATTGCATTCCTGGCATCCATACTT-3′; forward, 5′-TGCTGCAGCCCGCAGTCAGGCGGTCTTTTTCTG-3′; reverse, 5′-TATTAGGACAAGGCTGGTGGGCAC-3′). The two PCR products were digested with AfeI-PstI/Pst1-EcoN1 and inserted into FLAG-Chfr (WT), which was digested with AfeI and EcoNI. Polyethyleneimine was used for DNA transfection (20Yun C. Cho H. Kim S.J. Lee J.H. Park S.Y. Chan G.K. Cho H. Mol. Cancer Res. 2004; 2: 159-169PubMed Google Scholar). Antibodies for Chfr, Plk1, Cdc20 were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, and antibodies for phosphohistone H3 were obtained from Upstate Technology (Lake Placid, NY). Actin and FLAG antibodies were purchased from Sigma. HeLa cells were cultured in DMEM/F-12 (Sigma) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS), 1% antibiotic-antimycotic (Invitrogen) in CO2 incubator. Chang cells were cultured in DMEM (Invitrogen), and T24 and DLD1 cells were in RPMI 1640 with 10% FBS. Chang and HeLa Cells were synchronized at the G1/S boundary using the double thymidine block (DTB) method as previously described (20Yun C. Cho H. Kim S.J. Lee J.H. Park S.Y. Chan G.K. Cho H. Mol. Cancer Res. 2004; 2: 159-169PubMed Google Scholar). HeLa cells were incubated with 2 mm thymidine (Sigma) for 20 h followed by thymidine-free incubation for 8 h and subjected to the second thymidine incubation for 14 h. Chang cells were treated with 2 mm thymidine for 16 h, released for 8 h, and then treated with second thymidine for 16 h. Cells were washed to remove thymidine with PBS and allowed to progress to G2/M phase. To obtain S phase-arrested cells, cells were allowed to grow in 2 mm hydroxyurea-containing media. For isolation of cells in G2 and mitotic phase, cells were treated with 100 ng/ml nocodazole for 12 h, and floating mitotic cells and residual adherent cells were separately collected. Alternatively, G2 cells were obtained by treatment with 100 μm roscovitine (Sigma). For analysis of cell cycle profiles, cells released from DTB were harvested by trypsinization, washed twice with PBS, and fixed in 70% ethanol on ice for 30 min. Fixed cells were washed twice with PBS and resuspended in solution containing propidium iodide (PI) and RNase A. PI-stained cells were analyzed for their DNA content by FACSCalibur (BD Biosciences), and cell cycle distribution percentage was calculated by Cell WinMDI Version 2.8 software. Mitotic index was determined by counting the cells with mitotic condensed chromatin, which were stained with aceto-orcein (Sigma) under light microscope. For each group, ∼500 cells were analyzed. HeLa cells were incubated in thymidine containing DMEM for 20 h and released from the thymidine block for 8 h. During the first thymidine-free incubation, cells were transfected with His-ubiquitin and FLAG-Chfr (wild-type or K2A-mutant). After the DTB, cells were allowed to progress by G2/M phase. Cells were treated with 2 μm MG132 for 6 h before harvest. Whole cell extracts were prepared by E1A lysis buffer (50 mm HEPES (pH 7.0), 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 5 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, and protease inhibitors). Lysates were clarified by high speed centrifugation and quantified by using a Bradford reagent (Bio-Rad). The same protein lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG antibody coupled to protein A-Sepharose beads for 1 h at 4 °C. The immune complexes were washed four times with lysis buffer thoroughly. The samples were dissolved in 2× Laemmli sample buffer, boiled for 5 min, and separated by SDS-PAGE. The analysis of ubiquitylation was performed by immunoblotting using anti-ubiquitin antibody (Santa Cruz). For the in vitro ubiquitylation assay, the immunoprecipitates obtained by using anti-FLAG antibody were thoroughly washed four times and incubated with E1 (0.5 μg), UbcH5b (0.5 μg), and ubiquitin (5 μg) in buffer containing 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.3), 5 mm ATP, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT, and 2 5 μm MG132 at 37 °C for 1 h. The analysis of ubiquitylation was performed by immunoblotting using anti-ubiquitin antibody. Alternatively, the immunoprecipitates were pretreated with 60 units of calf intestinal phosphatase (CIP) for 1 h at 37 °C and subjected to ubiquitin conjugation in vitro. Cells were seeded on coverslips and fixed with a mixture of acetone:methanol (1:1) solution for 10 min. The fixed cells were preincubated in blocking solution (1% bovine serum albumin in PBS) for 1 h followed by incubation with anti-FLAG antibody overnight at 4 °C. The cells were then washed and probed with fluorescence-conjugated secondary antibody for 1 h. Finally, coverslips were submerged in PBS containing 4′6-diamidino-2-phenyindole (DAPI, Molecular Probes) and mounted with Vectashield (Vector Laboratories) for microscopic observation. FLAG-tagged proteins were detected with Cy3-conjugated anti-rat IgG antibody (Molecular Probes). Images were captured under confocal microscopy (LSM510, Zeiss, Germany). HeLa cells were synchronized at the G1/S boundary by the DTB method. During the DTB, cells were transfected with the FLAG-Chfr (WT) or FLAG-Chfr K2A. At each indicated time, cells were harvested and lysed in the lysis buffer (10 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1% SDS, 0.5% deoxycholic acid and 1 mm EDTA) containing protease and phosphatase inhibitors (2 μg/ml aprotinin, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 μg/ml pepstatin, and 50 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). The same protein lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-cyclin B1 antibody coupled to protein G-Sepharose beads for 3 h at 4 °C. Beads were washed twice with lysis buffer and subsequently with kinase buffer (50 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.5), 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT). Phosphorylation reaction was carried out in 20 μl of kinase buffer supplemented with 50 μg/ml histone H1 (Roche Diagnostics) and 10 Ci/mmol of [γ-32P]ATP at 37 °C for 30 min. The samples were dissolved in Laemmli sample buffer, boiled for 5 min, separated by SDA-PAGE, and analyzed by autoradiography. For immunoblotting, lysates were boiled, separated with SDS-PAGE, and transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore). The immunoblots were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence system (Amersham Biosciences). The error bars on the figures represent the mean ± S.D. of the independent determinations. The statistical analysis was performed with two-sided unpaired t tests used to assess statistical significance. Differences with p values of <0.05 were considered to be statistically significant. Because the checkpoint function of Chfr primarily relies on Chfr levels, we hypothesized that Chfr levels might be changed in response to microtubule stress (3Scolnick D.M. Halazonetis T.D. Nature. 2000; 406: 430-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). To address this, we transfected cells of the DLD1 colon carcinoma cell line, which do not express Chfr protein, with a vector-encoding FLAG-tagged wild-type Chfr (FLAG-Chfr or FLAG-Chfr WT). Twenty-four hours after transfection, we induced mitotic stress by exposing cells to nocodazole (100 ng/ml) and determined the level of Chfr by immunoblotting. Consistent with previous findings (3Scolnick D.M. Halazonetis T.D. Nature. 2000; 406: 430-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar), a low percentage of Chfr-transfected cells was mitotic, as evidenced by low levels of phosphohistone H3, a well known mitotic marker, 16 h after nocodazole treatment (Fig. 1A). Notably, nocodazole treatment led to a ∼2–3-fold increase in Chfr levels. To confirm whether this phenomenon can be generalized to other cells, we tested two other cell lines, T24 and HeLa, by transfecting FLAG-Chfr WT. In both cell types, Chfr protein levels were significantly increased after a 16-h exposure to nocodazole (Fig. 1B). This is the first indication that Chfr levels are elevated in response to mitotic stress. These findings raised the possibility that the elevation in Chfr levels induced by microtubule stress contributes to the activation or maintenance of the checkpoint, serving as a regulatory factor for mitotic entry. If so, Chfr levels should differ between cells that remain in G2 phase and those that enter mitosis. To test this, we separately collected floating (mitotic) and adherent HeLa cells after treating with nocodazole for 12 h and analyzed Chfr expression. In adherent cells, the G2-specific marker CENP-F (centromere protein F) was localized to the nucleus, indicating that these cells are in G2 phase (21Liao H. Winkfein R.J. Mack G. Rattner J.B. Yen T.J. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 507-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar, 22Hussein D. Taylor S.S. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 3403-3414Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). By contrast, CENP-F was localized to the kinetochore in floating cells, indicating that these cells are in the mitotic phase (supplemental Fig. 1A). Notably, Chfr levels were reduced in mitotic cells but remained high in G2 phase cells (Fig. 1C), supporting our hypothesis. Taken together, our results indicate that Chfr levels play a role in controlling mitotic entry under microtubule stress conditions. Assuming that Chfr levels control mitotic entry, as suggested by our data, we hypothesized that the steady-state levels of Chfr would be regulated during the cell cycle, especially before mitotic entry. To test this, we synchronized Chfr-transfected HeLa cells at the G1/S boundary using the DTB method and then allowed synchronized cells to reenter the cell cycle by releasing them into fresh medium. A flow cytometry analysis revealed that ectopic expression of Chfr did not significantly affect cell-cycle progression profiles; two-thirds of cells were in G2/M phase at R10 (10 h after DTB release) and partly reentered G1 phase at R12 (supplemental Fig. 1B). As shown in Fig. 2A, Chfr expression levels were high in G1/S phase (R0) cells but were markedly decreased during G2-M phase (R9–R12). We also monitored cell cycle-dependent changes in Chfr levels in cells synchronized at each phase by chemical reagents. S phase-arrested cells were obtained by treatment with 2 mm hydroxyurea for 18 h; cells at G2 were collected by adding 100 μm cyclinB/Cdk1 inhibitor roscovitine 7 h after DTB release and incubating for 5 h. Consistent with the results obtained above, Chfr levels were reduced in G2-arrested cells (Fig. 2B), indicating the presence of a regulatory pathway that reduces Chfr levels at G2 phase. It is known that Chfr is a RING finger-containing ubiquitin ligase whose level can be regulated by auto-ubiquitylation (23Canning M. Boutell C. Parkinson J. Everett R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 38160-38168Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 24Joazeiro C.A. Weissman A.M. Cell. 2000; 102: 549-552Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1047) Google Scholar). We, therefore, examined whether the intrinsic ubiquitin ligase activity of Chfr is required for the cell cycle-dependent degradation of Chfr protein. To address this, we transfected HeLa cells with FLAG-Chfr ΔRF (RING-dead) or FLAG-ChfrI306A (devoid of ubiquitin ligase activity) and measured Chfr levels during different phases of the cell cycle. We observed that, unlike cells expressing FLAG-Chfr WT, cells expressing FLAG-Chfr ΔRF or FLAG-ChfrI306A did not exhibit cell cycle-dependent degradation of Chfr during G2/M progression (Fig. 2C). We next examined whether the reduction in Chfr levels at G2 phase is mediated by variations in ubiquitylation activity during the cell cycle. Accordingly, we co-transfected HeLa cells with FLAG-Chfr WT and an expression plasmid for His-tagged ubiquitin and collected cells from each phase of the cell cycle as noted in Fig. 2B. Cell lysates were immunoprecipitated using an anti-FLAG antibody followed by Western blotting with an anti-ubiquitin antibody. Interestingly, extensively ubiquitylated Chfr was observed exclusively in G2-arrested cells and not in cells at S phase and asynchronously growing cells (Fig. 2D), indicating that Chfr proteins are degraded at G2 phase in an ubiquitylation-dependent manner. To further verify our findings, we carried out an in vitro ubiquitin conjugation assay (11Bothos J. Summers M.K. Venere M. Scolnick D.M. Halazonetis T.D. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 7101-7107Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 25Oh Y.M. Kwon Y.E. Kim J.M. Bae S.J. Lee B.K. Yoo S.J. Chung C.H. Deshaies R.J. Seol J.H. Nat Cell Biol. 2009; 11: 295-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). HeLa cells were transfected with FLAG-Chfr and collected cells from each phase of the cell cycle. The immunoprecipitates obtained by anti-FLAG antibody were incubated with E1, UbcH5b as E2, ubiquitin, and ATP, and ubiquitylation patterns were analyzed by immunoblotting. We found that in vitro auto-ubiquitination activities of Chfr in cells of G2 and mitotic phase were higher than that of G1/S (Fig. 2, E and F). In addition, pretreatment with phosphatase reduced the increased auto-ubiquitination activities of Chfr in G2 and mitotic phase (Fig. 2F), indicating that cell cycle-dependent changes of Chfr auto-ubiquitination is likely controlled by phosphorylation. Taken together, these results demonstrate that Chfr exhibits a cell cycle-dependent turnover that is regulated by its auto-ubiquitylation activity. Next, we asked whether the cell cycle-dependent turnover of Chfr protein is necessary for cell-cycle progression. Because the loss of Chfr ubiquitin ligase activity in FLAG-Chfr ΔRF or FLAG-ChfrI306A might affect cell-cycle progression due to loss of stability and failure to degrade extrinsic target substrates, we attempted to produce a mutant Chfr construct that did not contain target sites for auto-ubiquitylation but still retained its ligase activity. Previous studies proposed that a Chfr fragment comprising amino acids 281–375, which contains the entire RING finger E3 ligase domain, may target sites in flanking regions for polyubiquitination (26Loring G.L. Christensen K.C. Gerber S.A. Brenner C. Cell Cycle. 2008; 7: 96-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). We, therefore, generated three mutant constructs in which putative auto-ubiquitylation target lysine residues were replaced with alanine: FLAG-Chfr K2A, containing K384A and K393A substitutions; FLAG-Chfr K3A, containing three Lys-to-Ala substitutions (K257A/K258A/K259A); and FLAG-Chfr K5A, containing all five substitutions (Fig. 3A). After transfecting HeLa cells with the same amount of plasmid DNA encoding either of these alanine-substitution mutants or FLAG-Chfr WT, we found that the basal expression level of each alanine-substitution mutant, determined by Western blotting, was higher than that of wild-type Chfr (Fig. 3B), suggesting that these mutants are likely resistant to ubiquitylation. An examination of subcellular localization by immunofluorescence staining showed that both FLAG-Chfr K2A and FLAG-Chfr WT were present in the nucleus (Fig. 3C). In contrast, both FLAG-Chfr K3A and FLAG-Chfr K5A were mainly detected in the cytoplasm. Because Chfr was originally defined as a nuclear protein (8Mariatos G. Bothos J. Zacharatos P. Summers M.K. Scolnick D.M. Kittas C. Halazonetis T.D. Gorgoulis V.G. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 7185-7189PubMed Google Scholar) that appears to be derived from nuclear localization signal at amino acid residues 257–259 (27Kwon Y.E. Kim Y.S. Oh Y.M. Seol J.H. Mol. Cells. 2009; 27: 359-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar), the FLAG-Chfr K2A mutant was chosen for further study because it retained a wild-type-like subcellular localization. We first examined whether the putative auto-ubiquitylation target mutant FLAG-Chfr K2A showed cell cycle-dependent degradation. A significant reduction in FLAG-Chfr WT protein was consistently observed during G2/M transition (Fig. 4A). In contrast, the protein level of FLAG-Chfr K2A did not change from R0 to R12, suggesting that FLAG-Chfr K2A escaped from auto-ubiquitylation and subsequent degradation. Interestingly, histone H3 phosphorylation was markedly weaker in cells expressing FLAG-Chfr K2A, indicating that mitotic entry was hindered in these cells. Next, we compared the ubiquitylation status of FLAG-Chfr WT and the FLAG-Chfr K2A mutant in vivo after co-transfection of His-tagged ubiquitin and Chfr expression vectors (Fig. 4B). We observed a significant increase in ubiquitylation on FLAG-Chfr WT during G2/M progression (R8 and R10), whereas little ubiquitylation was observed at G1/S (R0). In contrast, ubiquitylation on FLAG-Chfr K2A was greatly suppressed at R8 and R10 (Fig. 4B), indicating that Lys-384 and Lys-393 are indeed important ubiquitylation target sites. Collectively, our data demonstrate that the auto-ubiquitylation activity of Chfr is important for controlling Chfr levels during G2/M transition. Thus, mutation of putative auto-ubiquitylation target sites of Chfr abrogates cell cycle-dependent Chfr degradation, leading to high Chfr levels during the cell cycle. It was notable that G2/M transition appeared to be hindered in cells maintaining high Chfr levels (Fig. 4A). To further investigate this, we transfected HeLa cells with two different amounts of FLAG-Chfr expression plasmid and examined subsequent effects on G2/M transition. We found that a higher concentration (4 μg) of FLAG-Chfr WT reduced phosphohistone H3 levels (Fig. 5A), an effect that was almost completely abolished by co-transfection with 4 μg of FLAG-Chfr K2A, strongly indicating that Chfr levels are critical for controlling G2/M transition. Next, we examined cell-cycle profiles during G2/M progression in these cells after synchronization using the DTB method. Flow cytometry analyses revealed that G2/M phase cell populations at R10 were similar among pCDNA-transfected control cells and FLAG-Chfr WT- and FLAG-Chfr K2A-transfected cells (Fig. 5B). However, at R12, ∼90% of control cells reentered the G1 phase, whereas 17 and 30% of FLAG-Chfr WT- and FLAG-Chfr K2A-transfected cells, respectively, remained in G2/M phase. In fact, an analysis of the mitotic index, determined by staining cells with aceto-orcein, showed that the percentage of mitotic cells at R10 was significantly lower in FLAG-Chfr K2A-expressing cells than in FLAG-Chfr WT- or vector (control)-expressing cells (Fig. 5C). Control- and FLAG-Chfr WT-expressing cells reached a peak of mitosis 10 h after DTB release, at which time 25–30% of cells were in mitosis; however, the mitotic index of FLAG-Chfr K2A-expressing cells was as low as 15%. Moreover, a higher concentration (4 μg) of Chfr-K2A further decreased the mitotic index to less than 10%, demonstrating a clear inverse relationship between Chfr levels and mitotic index. To understand the underlying molecular mechanism, we determined the level of cyclin B1-associated kinase activity, which is critical for G2/M transition. As shown in Fig. 5D, cyclin B1-associated kinase activity in cells expressing FLAG-Chfr WT was high at R8 and was further increased at R10. In contrast, cyclin B1-associated kinase activity in FLAG-Chfr K2A-expressing cells remained low from R8 to R10 and became elevated at 10.5 h (Fig. 5D). Thus, our data clearly demonstrate that high expression levels of Chfr at G2 phase suppress cyclin B1-associated kinase activity, thereby causing a delay in mitotic entry. This is the first indication that balanced Chfr level at G2 phase is a critical factor in controlling the timing of mitotic entry. Although it has been previously reported that Chfr mediates the degradation of Plk1 in Xenopus cell-free extracts (13Kang D. Chen J. Wong J. Fang G. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 156: 249-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar), these findings have remained controversial in mammalian systems (16Erson A.E. Petty E.M. Mol. Carcinog. 2004; 39: 26-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Plk1 is an important cell-cycle regulator that determines the timing of mitotic entry by controlling cyclin B1-associated kinase activity (28Smits V.A. Klompmaker R. Arnaud L. Rijksen G. Nigg E.A. Medema R.H. Nat Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 672-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar, 29Seki A. Coppinger J.A. Jang C.Y. Yates J.R. Fang G.

Aurora A kinase, another important target substrate of Chfr, also modulates cyclin B1-associated kinase activities, mainly at centrosomes (31Yu X. Minter-Dykhouse K. Malureanu L. Zhao W.M. Zhang D. Merkle C.J. Ward I.M. Saya H. Fang G. van Deursen J. Chen J. Nat. Genet. 2005; 37: 401-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar, 32Liu Q. Ruderman J.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 5811-5816Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). We, therefore, investigated whether the levels of Plk1 and Aurora A showed any correlations with Chfr levels during the cell cycle. HeLa cells were transfected with FLAG-Chfr WT or mutant forms of Chfr (K2A, K5A, ΔRF) and synchronized at S phase and G2 phase by hydroxyurea and roscovitine, respectively. The expression levels of Plk1 and Aurora A were higher in G2-arrested cells than in S phase-arrested cells (Fig. 6A). Notably, at G2 phase, Chfr expression levels in cells expressing either FLAG-Chfr K2A or FLAG-Chfr K5A were 2–3-fold higher than in FLAG-Chfr WT-expressing cells (Fig. 6A), and Plk1 levels were reduced by half (Fig. 6A, right panel). In contrast, the Plk1 level in cells expressing FLAG-Chfr ΔRF, which lacks Chfr ubiquitin ligase activity, was similar to that in FLAG-Chfr WT-expressing cells, indicating that Chfr-dependent Plk1 degradation does not occur. Thus, the data showed an inverse relationship between Chfr and Plk1 levels at G2 phase but not in S phase. In contrast, we did not observe any significant changes in Aurora A levels, indicating that Chfr-mediated Aurora A degradation does not occur in a cell cycle-dependent manner. Next, we examined whether Plk1 was a genuine G2 phase-specific substrate of Chfr by carrying out an in vivo ubiquitylation assay. HeLa cells were co-transfected with a His-tagged ubiquitin expression construct and different Chfr constructs, after which whole-cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-Plk1 antibody and then analyzed by Western blotting using an anti-ubiquitin antibody. As shown in Fig. 6B, there was little, if any, Plk1 ubiquitylation in S phase-arrested cells. Notably, ubiquitylation on Plk1 was strongly promoted at G2 phase in cells expressing FLAG-Chfr K2A, but neither FLAG-Chfr WT nor FLAG-Chfr ΔRF (RING-dead) promoted Chfr-dependent ubiquitylation on Plk1 (Fig. 6B). The lower panel of Fig. 6B shows that equal amounts of Chfr and Plk1 (Input) were used for the assay. Thus far, our data strongly suggest that FLAG-Chfr K2A can induce a delay in G2/M transition by reducing Plk1 levels at G2 phase. Indeed, when Myc-tagged Plk1 was overexpressed in FLAG-Chfr K2A-expressing cells, we found a notable recovery of mitotic index at R10 (Fig. 6C). Consistent with this, cyclin B1-associated kinase activity was elevated by more than 2-fold at time points 10–10.5 h after DTB (Fig. 6D). Taken together, our data demonstrate that Plk1 is an important downstream target of Chfr ubiquitin ligase at G2 phase, and its level is critical for the activation of cyclin B1-associated kinase and mitotic entry. In the present study we demonstrated that Chfr levels changed in a logical way to cope with different cellular microenvironments; they are elevated upon microtubule damage, serving as a cell-cycle checkpoint, and they are markedly reduced at G2 phase, relieving a break against entry into mitosis. Thus, the data presented here highlight the importance of Chfr levels in both checkpoint function and control of cell-cycle progression. The auto-ubiquitylation activity of Chfr mediates cell cycle-dependent changes in Chfr levels. We demonstrated that reduced Chfr levels at G2 phase were accompanied by an increase in ubiquitylation on Chfr that was dependent on Chfr E3 ligase activity (Fig. 2). These findings partially reiterate those of a previous report (12Chaturvedi P. Sudakin V. Bobiak M.L. Fisher P.W. Mattern M.R. Jablonski S.A. Hurle M.R. Zhu Y. Yen T.J. Zhou B.B. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 1797-1801PubMed Google Scholar) in that fluctuations in Chfr levels over the cell cycle were lost in cells expressing the FLAG-Chfr ΔRF mutant, which lacks E3 ligase activity. Importantly, the auto-ubiquitylation-defective FLAG-Chfr K2A mutant did not show cell cycle-dependent changes. In fact, it effectively inhibited entry into mitosis (Fig. 5), suggesting that auto-ubiquitylation and degradation of Chfr at G2 phase is a prerequisite for proper cell-cycle progression into mitosis. Thus, Chfr not only acts as a mitotic stress checkpoint in the presence of microtubule damage but also controls cell-cycle progression at the G2/M transition. The fact that Chfr degrades at G2 phase helps to explain why ectopic expression of Chfr in cells that lack it does not usually cause cell-cycle delay. However, the robust elevation in Chfr levels in response to microtubule damage (Fig. 1), noted previously (18Matsusaka T. Pines J. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 166: 507-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), confers a stronger gatekeeper function that prevents cells from entering mitosis. Notably, FLAG-Chfr ΔRF-expressing cells entered mitosis without any delay, as determined by phosphohistone H3 levels (Fig. 2D), suggesting that ubiquitylation of target substrates is crucial in the control of cell-cycle progression. In addition, we addressed whether cell cycle-dependent Chfr degradation occurs in cells stably expressing Chfr. We established different clones that stably express wild-type Chfr or Chfr K2A mutant (FLAG-Chfr K2A-S). The FLAG-Chfr WT-S or FLAG-Chfr-S7 cells expressing wild-type Chfr showed cell cycle-dependent degradation, whereas the FLAG-Chfr-K2A-S cells did not (supplemental Fig. 2, A and B). However, we notified that cell cycle-dependent degradation of Chfr in stable cells was weakened probably due to low Chfr protein levels. In fact, when we compared the Chfr protein levels in three stable cell lines (FLAG-Chfr-S1, FLAG-Chfr-S7, FLAG-Chfr-S9) to those in transiently transfected cells, all of the stable cell lines showed much lower Chfr protein levels (upper panel of supplemental Fig. 2B). These consistent observations suggest that cells cannot tolerate high Chfr protein, and therefore, the cells proliferate/survive through controlling its auto-ubiquitination and/or hypermethylation on its own promoter (7Corn P.G.

Takahashi T. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 2328-2333Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). There have been conflicting reports on whether Plk-1 is an important substrate of Chfr in Chfr-mediated cell-cycle delay. The first evidence for such a role came from the Xenopus system, where Chfr-dependent ubiquitylation of Plk1 was demonstrated. The authors showed that degradation of Plk1 by Chfr is responsible for the delay in mitotic entry because of inhibition of cyclinB/Cdc2 (13Kang D. Chen J. Wong J. Fang G. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 156: 249-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). However, overexpression of Chfr in human cells has not been shown to cause a reduction in Plk1 levels (16Erson A.E. Petty E.M. Mol. Carcinog. 2004; 39: 26-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 17Summers M.K. Bothos J. Halazonetis T.D. Oncogene. 2005; 24: 2589-2598Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 18Matsusaka T. Pines J. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 166: 507-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). In the present study overexpression of FLAG-Chfr WT tended to decrease Plk1 levels (Fig. 6A), but these differences were not significant. However, introduction of auto-ubiquitylation-defective mutants FLAG-Chfr K2A or FLAG-Chfr K5A into cells resulted in a significant reduction in Plk1 levels compared with those in cells expressing FLAG-Chfr WT. More intriguingly, these differences were only observed in G2 phase and not in S phase, indicating that Chfr-mediated Plk1 degradation occurs in a cell cycle-dependent manner. Thus, previous reports based on asynchronous cell cultures would be unable to detect an inverse relationship between Chfr and Plk1; our data, based on precisely synchronized cells, fully support the previous findings of the Xenopus system in which a well characterized synchronization method was applied (13Kang D. Chen J. Wong J. Fang G. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 156: 249-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). In addition, Plk1 levels were similar in cells expressing FLAG-Chfr ΔRF, which lacks ubiquitin ligase activity, and FLAG-Chfr WT, both of which enter mitosis, supporting the interpretation that the Plk1 level is crucial in determining mitotic entry. One key remaining question that will need to be addressed by future research is what triggers activation of Chfr ubiquitin ligase at the G2 phase. It is reasonable to speculate that Chfr is post-translationally modified to achieve full E3 ligase activity. The possibility that Chfr is phosphorylated was initially suggested based on differences in the electrophoretic mobility of Chfr bands (11Bothos J. Summers M.K. Venere M. Scolnick D.M. Halazonetis T.D. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 7101-7107Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar); Chfr phosphorylation has since been demonstrated in vivo and in vitro (15Shtivelman E. Mol Cancer Res. 2003; 1: 959-969PubMed Google Scholar). In fact, we found that pretreatment with phosphatase reduced the increased auto-ubiquitylation activities of Chfr in G2 and mitotic phase (Fig. 2F), indicating that phosphorylation of Chfr controls its auto-ubiquitylation activity. It is also very unlikely that cyclin B1/Cdk1 phosphorylates or modulates Chfr because FLAG-Chfr K2A is fully active in the presence of roscovitine, a cyclin B1/Cdk1 inhibitor (Fig. 6, A and B). Notably, however, injection of active cyclin A/Cdk2 into PtK1 cells actually overrides the anaphase checkpoint in response to colcemide treatment (18Matsusaka T. Pines J. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 166: 507-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), suggesting that cyclin A/Cdk2 may modulate Chfr activity through phosphorylation. In summary, our results provide the first evidence that Chfr auto-ubiquitylation and degradation is biologically significant in the cell cycle and checkpoint function of Chfr.

https://openalex.org/W1978119527,"The efficacy of drugs used to treat cancer can be significantly attenuated by adaptive responses of neoplastic cells to drug-induced stress. To determine how cancer cells respond to inhibition of the enzyme fatty acid synthase (FAS), we focused on NF-κB-mediated pathways, which can be activated by various cellular stresses. Treating lung cancer cells with C93, a pharmacological inhibitor of FAS, results in changes indicative of a rapid initiation of NF-κB signaling, including translocation of RelA/p65 NF-κB to the nucleus, activation of a transfected NF-κB-luciferase reporter, and increased expression of NF-κB-dependent transcripts, IL-6, IL-8, and COX-2. Verifying that these responses to C93 are specifically related to inhibition of FAS, we confirmed that levels of these same transcripts increase in response to siRNA targeting FAS. Inhibiting this NF-κB response (either by transfecting a mutant IκBα or treating with bortezomib) resulted in increased cell killing by C93, indicating that the NF-κB response is protective in this setting. Because inhibiting FAS leads to accumulation of intermediate metabolites of fatty acid biosynthesis, we then questioned whether protein kinase C (PKC) is involved in this response to metabolic stress. Immunofluorescence microscopy revealed that C93 treatment results in cellular translocation of PKCα and PKCβ isoforms and increased PKCα-dependent phosphorylation of the IκBα subunit of NF-κB. Furthermore, inhibiting PKC activity with RO-31–8220 or PKCα isoform-specific siRNA attenuates C93-induced IκBα phosphorylation and NF-κB activation and also potentiates C93-induced cell killing. These results suggest a link between PKC and NF-κB in protecting cancer cells from metabolic stress induced by inhibiting FAS.

One central molecular network commonly altered in cancer pathogenesis and also affected by cancer treatment is that regulated by the transcription factor NF-κB. NF-κB signaling is constitutively activated in many epithelial solid tumors and hematologic malignancies (3Karin M. Cao Y. Greten F.R. Li Z.W. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2002; 2: 301-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (2265) Google Scholar, 4Kim H.J. Hawke N. Baldwin A.S. Cell Death Differ. 2006; 13: 738-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar, 5Rayet B. Gélinas C. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6938-6947Crossref PubMed Scopus (1010) Google Scholar), and this activation appears to generally confer resistance to apoptosis as well as enhance growth properties of cancer cells. Consequently, numerous inhibitors of NF-κB are being investigated for potential use in treating cancer (6Yamamoto Y. Gaynor R.B. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 107: 135-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (1363) Google Scholar, 7Wang C.Y. Mayo M.W. Baldwin Jr., A.S. Science. 1996; 274: 784-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (2515) Google Scholar), and bortezomib, a proteosome inhibitor widely used for treating myeloma, is thought to act largely through inhibition NF-κB by stabilization of the IκBα subunit (8Cusack Jr., J.C. Liu R. Houston M. Abendroth K. Elliott P.J. Adams J. Baldwin Jr., A.S. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 3535-3540PubMed Google Scholar, 9Chauhan D. Hideshima T. Mitsiades C. Richardson P. Anderson K.C. Mol. Cancer Ther. 2005; 4: 686-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Interestingly, NF-κB activity is also inhibited by a number of naturally occurring lipid compounds that have recognized anti-neoplastic properties, including curcumin, resveratol, and coix seed extract (10Singh S. Aggarwal B.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24995-25000Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1298) Google Scholar, 11Holmes-McNary M. Baldwin Jr., A.S. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 3477-3483PubMed Google Scholar, 12Woo J.H. Li D. Wilsbach K. Orita H. Coulter J. Tully E. Kwon T.K. Xu S. Gabrielson E. Cancer Biol. Ther. 2007; 6: 2005-2011Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), providing additional evidence to suggest that NF-κB activity supports or promotes the malignant phenotype. NF-κB activity does not uniformly contribute to malignancy, however, and in some situations, increased NF-κB activity may actually suppress malignant characteristics of cells (13Perkins N.D. Trends Cell Biol. 2004; 14: 64-69Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). For example, it has been shown that induction of p53 leads to activation of NF-κB, correlating with the ability of p53 to induce apoptosis (14Ryan K.M. Ernst M.K. Rice N.R. Vousden K.H. Nature. 2000; 404: 892-897Crossref PubMed Scopus (676) Google Scholar). Thus, at least in some cellular settings, inhibition or loss of NF-κB activity abrogates p53-induced apoptosis, indicating that NF-κB can be functional in p53-mediated cell death. The role of NF-κB signaling in the response of cancer cells to chemotherapy also appears to depend on variables of the particular situation. In many circumstances, activation of NF-κB by therapeutic agents appears to inhibit apoptosis and thus attenuates the response to these agents (15Pommier Y. Sordet O. Antony S. Hayward R.L. Kohn K.W. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 2934-2949Crossref PubMed Scopus (514) Google Scholar, 16Nakanishi C. Toi M. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2005; 5: 297-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (692) Google Scholar, 17Luo J.L. Kamata H. Karin M. J. Clin. Invest. 2005; 115: 2625-2632Crossref PubMed Scopus (708) Google Scholar). However, activation of NF-κB by cancer therapeutic agents appears to mediate cell death in other circumstances, including treatment with UV light (18Strozyk E. Pöppelmann B. Schwarz T. Kulms D. Oncogene. 2006; 25: 6239-6251Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), doxorubicin (19Bian X. McAllister-Lucas L.M. Shao F. Schumacher K.R. Feng Z. Porter A.G. Castle V.P. Opipari Jr., A.W. J.

Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 4426-4432PubMed Google Scholar). In light of the general importance of NF-κB to cellular physiology and response to stress and the expectation that manipulations of lipid metabolic pathways could affect NF-κB signaling, we investigated the effects of inhibiting FAS on NF-κB and the role of NF-κB signaling in the response of lung cancer cells to this inhibition. Human lung cancer cell lines A549 and H1975 (American Type Culture Collection) were cultured in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum at 37 °C/5% CO2. Cultures were screened periodically for mycoplasma contamination. For experiments using a constitutively active mutant IκBα to inhibit NF-κB, we stably transfected A549 cells with either the mutant IκBα (mIκBα; a gift of Drs. Yi Huang and Weimin Fan (21Huang Y. Fan W. Mol. Pharmacol. 2002; 61: 105-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar)) or pcDNA3.1A(−) control vector (Invitrogen). In brief, 1 × 105 cells were transfected with 2 μg of mIκBα plasmid) encoding a G418 resistance gene with 6 μl of Lipofectamine (Invitrogen) for 4 h. The transfection mixture was replaced with RPMI supplemented with 10% serum, and incubation was continued for 2 days before initiating selection with G418 (300 μg/ml). Resistant clones were selected at 4 weeks and screened for mIκBα protein expression by Western blot using IκBα antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA). Cell lines transfected with empty vectors, pcDNA3.1A(−), were also screened by G418 in parallel for controls. The specific FAS inhibitor C93, supplied by FASgen (Baltimore, MD), was dissolved in DMSO at a stock concentration of 50 mg/ml. Bortezomib (Millennium, Cambridge, MA) was dissolved in distilled H2O at a stock concentration of 1 mg/ml. RO-31-8220, SC-791, and NS-398 (Calbiochem) were prepared at stock dilutions of 2 mm, 10 mm, and 10 μm, respectively, in DMSO. Prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) (Sigma-Aldrich) was prepared as a 2 mm stock in distilled H2O. Fluorescein-tagged small interfering RNA (siRNA) against FAS was generated using combinations of sequences corresponding to nucleotides 1212–1231 (AACCCTGAGATCCCAGCGCTG) and 329–348 (AAGCAGGCACACACGATGGAC) of human FAS. For PKCα, siRNA was generated using a sequence corresponding to nucleotides 513–533 (AAGCTCCATGTCACAGTACGA), and non-targeting control siRNA was made using the sequence AATTCTCCGAACGTGTCACGT (all siRNA provided by Invitrogen). Dharmacon SMART Pool (Lafayette, CO) was used for PKCβ siRNA. All siRNA transfections were performed over 48 h using oligofectamine (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. For measurements of specific protein levels in cultured cells, samples were collected in lysis buffer (50 mmol/liter Tris-Cl (pH 7.0), 1 mmol/liter EDTA, 1% Triton X-100) and sonicated until clear. Protein concentration was determined by the Pierce BCA assay (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA), and 50 μg of protein from each sample was then separated by electrophoresis on 4–15% gradient Tris-HCl gels. Proteins were then transferred to Trans-Blot membranes (Bio-Rad) and incubated with specific primary antibodies at specified concentrations: COX-2 at 1:1000, PKCα at 1:1000, IκBα at 1:1000, phospho-IKKα/β at 1:200, and phospho-IκBα at 1:500 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.); FAS at 1:106 (FASgen); and pan-phospho-PKC at 1:500 (Novus Biologicals, Littleton, CO). Membranes were also probed with rabbit anti-actin (Sigma) at 1:25,000 dilution (for loading control) and with anti-rabbit (Sigma) secondary antibody. Membranes were developed using SuperSignal West Femto Max Sensitivity Substrate (Thermo Fisher Scientific). A549 or H1975 cells were plated in 96-well plates (10,000 cells/well) and allowed to adhere overnight. Cells were then incubated in 100 μl of RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 0.5% FBS and treated for 20 h with designated combinations of C93, bortezomib, RO-31-8220, or SC-791. MTS assays were performed according to the manufacturer's instructions by adding 20 μl of the CellTiter 96® AQueous One Solution (Promega, Madison, WI) reagent directly to culture wells, incubating for 1–4 h, and then recording absorbance at 490 nm with a 96-well plate reader. Cell survival was calculated by subtracting readings from blank wells (no cells) and comparing with untreated control cells. Cloning efficiency (CE) was determined by seeding limiting dilutions of 3 or 100 cells/well (for treatment) in 96-well plates for both A549 and H1975 cells. A549 or H1975 cells were plated and allowed to adhere overnight and then incubated in RPMI1640 medium containing 0.5% FBS. 100 cell/well plates were then treated with designated concentrations of C93, bortezomib, RO-31-8220, or combinations of these drugs for 4 h. Medium in all plates was changed to RPMI containing 10% FBS after treatment, and cells were allowed to grow for 4 weeks with the medium being changed at 2 weeks. Wells were analyzed by light microscopy to determine colony formation. The CE of each cell line was determined using Poisson statistics, where CE = −(ln(fraction of negative wells))/(number of cells seeded per well). The CE for each cell line presented in Table 1 is expressed as the mean for all replicate cultures of that line. The percentage decrease in survival was determined by comparing CE in treated groups with untreated cell line control cells.TABLE 1Survival of lung cancer cells treated with combinations of bortezomib and C93Cloning efficiencyPercentage reduction versus control%H1975 + 3 μg/ml C930.0098 ± 0.0012H1975 + 3 μg/ml C93 + 100 nm bortezomib0.0049 ± 0.000749.3A549 pcDNA + 3 μg/ml C930.0017 ± 0.0003A549 mIκBa + 3 μg/ml C930.0002 ± 0.000285.1 Open table in a new tab Cells were cultured on coverslips coated with 25 μg/ml human plasma fibronectin (Invitrogen), incubated overnight in RPMI 1640 with reduced (0.5%) FBS, and then treated with C93 in new medium. Cells were fixed and permeabilized with 3% paraformaldehyde and 0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS; rinsed with PBS; incubated with polyclonal antibody against PKCα, PKCβb, PKCδ, or NF-κB (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.); and detected with fluorophore-conjugated isotype-specific, affinity cross-adsorbed anti-IgG antibodies (Chemicon). 4′,6-Diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) was used to highlight cell nuclei, and images were acquired using epifluorescence microscopy (Eclipse 200, Nikon) with a ×60 objective, Openlab software (Improvision, Lexington, MA), and an internally cooled 12-bit CCD camera (CoolSnapHQ, Photometrics, Tucson, AZ). Transcript levels were measured by quantitative real-time PCR using previously described methods (22Ponchel F. Toomes C. Bransfield K. Leong F.T. Douglas S.H. Field S.L. Bell S.M. Combaret V.

Quantitative PCRs were performed in triplicate using an iCycler (Bio-Rad). The amplified products were quantified by fluorescence intensity of SYBR Green I (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR). Average -fold changes were calculated by differences in threshold cycles (Ct) between pairs of samples to be compared. A549 cells (at 70% confluence) were co-transfected using oligofectamine (Invitrogen) with the NF-κB-Luc construct (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA), which links a firefly luciferase reporter to an NF-κB response element and a Renilla luciferase construct (Promega). For designated experiments, cells were also co-transfected with siRNA targeting PKC isoforms as described above. At designated time points, cell lysates were prepared, and luminescence was measured using the Dual Luciferase Reporter Assay System (Promega) with a Victor2 fluorometer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Data reported are an average of the ratio of firefly/Renilla luminescence. A549 cells were cultured at ∼80% density in 12-well plates with or without C93 (3 μg/ml) in RPMI medium containing 0.5% FBS for 24 h. Medium was then changed and collected at the indicated time intervals for measuring PGE2 using an enzyme immunoassay (Arbor Assays, Ann Arbor, MI) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, control and samples were added to each well and incubated for 15 min at room temperature and overnight at 4 °C with primary antibody and conjugate. After washing, substrate solution was added to each well for 30 min at room temperature. Finally, “stop solution” was added, and the optical density of each well was determined within 30 min using a microplate reader (wavelength 450 nm). The standards used were in the range of 12.5–400 pg/ml (detection limit of 16.8 pg/ml) for PGE2 (sensitivity of 10.9 pg/ml). Bacterial expression vector for GST-IκBα (amino acids 1–54) was a gift of M. Karin (University of California, San Diego). Plasmids were transformed into the bacterial strain BL21(DE3) and induced with 1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 4 h at room temperature. The bacterial pellet from 250 ml of culture was suspended in 50 ml of PBS containing lysozyme, sonicated for 20 s, and frozen and thawed twice. The lysates were then cleared by centrifugation at 12,000 rpm for 30 min at 4 °C and incubated with precleared glutathione-Sepharose 4B (GE Healthcare) for 4 h at 4 °C. After rinsing, bound proteins were eluted with 20 mm reduced glutathione and desalted with a desalt spin column (Pierce). For the in vitro kinase assays, recombinant PKCα (Sigma) was incubated for 45 min at 30 °C in a 50-μl reaction mixture containing 20 mm Hepes (pH 7.4), 1.3 mm CaCl2, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT, 1 mm ATP, and 0.1 mg of GST-IκBα substrate. The reactions were terminated by the addition of SDS-sample buffer and heating for 5 min at 95 °C. The level of IκBα phosphorylation was evaluated by immunoblotting with anti-phospho-IκBα (Ser-32/36) (Cell Signaling) as described above. To test the effects of C93 treatment, cells were lysed and precleared for 3 h with Protein G-agarose (Roche Applied Science), followed by incubation for 1 h in the presence of an anti-PKCα antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.). Protein G-agarose was added and incubated overnight at 4 °C. The samples were then washed three times with buffer (50 mm Tris-Cl, 150 mm NaCl, and 0.1% Nonidet P-40, pH 7.5). Immunoprecipitate of PKCα was used as kinase, and purified GST-IκBα was used as a substrate in vitro. The level of phosphorylated IκBα was evaluated by immunoblotting with anti-phospho-IκBα (Ser-32/36) (Cell Signaling) as described above. Quantitative data were graphed and analyzed using GraphPad Prism 4 (GraphPad Software, La Jolla, CA). By convention, heights of columns represent means, and error bars represent S.E. values. Student's t tests were used for two-way comparisons of categories, and significance was noted for p < 0.05. To explore how inhibiting fatty acid synthase affects the NF-κB signaling pathway, we first evaluated the effects of C93, a second generation pharmacological inhibitor of FAS, on subcellular distribution of the p65/RelA subunit of NF-κB. Cultured A549 and H1975 non-small cell lung cancer cells were exposed to 5 μg/ml C93, stained using p65/RelA-specific antibodies, and evaluated by immunofluorescence imaging. At 1 h following C93 treatment, we observed translocation of p65/RelA from cytoplasm to the nucleus in both A549 cells and H1975 lung cancer cells (Fig. 1). This change occurred within a period of time that precedes measurable effects on cell survival, suggesting that NF-κB is activated early in the response of these cells to FAS inhibition. Functional activation of NF-κB in response to C93 treatment was measured using an NF-κB-responsive reporter assay and confirmed with measurements of NF-κB-dependent transcripts. For the reporter assay, A549 cells were first transfected with a luciferase reporter linked to an NF-κB enhancer designed to drive transcription of luciferase upon binding to RelA. Cells transfected with this construct showed a significant increase in luciferase fluorescence after treatment with C93 (Fig. 2A), consistent with activation of NF-κB in these cells. Similarly, using quantitative PCR, we found rapid changes in transcript levels of IL-6, IL-8, and COX-2, three prosurvival genes known to be regulated by NF-κB (23Pahl H.L. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6853-6866Crossref PubMed Scopus (3464) Google Scholar), after C93 treatment (5 μg/ml) in both A549 cells (Fig. 2B) and H1975 cells (Fig. 2C). Immunoblot analysis of COX-2 protein expression in A549 cells also confirmed C93-dependent induction of this gene product (Fig. 2D). The product of COX-2 activity, PGH2, was readily converted by prostaglandin E2 synthase into PGE2, and an enzyme immunoassay of cell supernatants confirmed that C93 treatment induced release of significant levels of PGE2 into culture medium (Fig. 2E). To verify that the activation of NF-κB signaling is specifically a result of inhibition of FAS and not an off target effect of C93, we used siRNA to specifically reduce levels of FAS in A549 cells. Because this approach cannot produce the rapid reduction of FAS activity seen with the pharmacological agent, we focused on measuring NF-κB-dependent transcripts to evaluate the effects of this siRNA treatment on NF-κB. As seen in Fig. 2F, transcript levels of IL-6, IL-8, and COX-2 were all increased after levels of FAS protein were reduced using siRNA, indicating that the same response typical for NF-κB activation could be induced by either pharmacological or molecular inhibition of FAS. As noted above, NF-κB has been found to have either prosurvival or proapoptotic effects, depending on the stimulus and possibly the cell environment. To determine the cellular effects of NF-κB activation in this setting, we transfected A549 cells with mIκBα, which diminishes NF-κB signaling (21Huang Y. Fan W. Mol. Pharmacol. 2002; 61: 105-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). This mIκBα construct has a deletion of the 36-amino acid sequence that contains the serine phosphorylation sites (Ser-32 and Ser-36) responsible for targeting IκBα for degradation. Thus, cells transfected with this degradation-resistant form of mIκBα trap NF-κB in an inactive state. For our experiments, transfection was confirmed by RT-PCR with primers specific to the mutant or wild-type IκBα, and an empty pcDNA3.1A(−) vector was used as control. To confirm functional efficacy of the transfection, transcripts of IL-6, IL-8, and COX-2 were measured using reverse transcription/quantitative PCR at 4, 8, and 24 h following C93 treatment and compared with levels in untreated control cells (Fig. 3, A–C). Although A549 cells transfected with empty pcDNA3.1A(−) vector showed increased transcript levels of all three genes after C93 treatment, these increases were significantly attenuated in cells transfected with the mutant IκBα. These data are consistent with our findings that these three prosurvival target genes are up-regulated through activation of the NF-κB pathway after treatment with C93. Experiments also showed that A549 cells are significantly more sensitive to cell killing by inhibition of FAS activity when cellular NF-κB activity is reduced by mIκBα. First, MTS assays (Fig. 3D) showed increased dose-dependent cell cytotoxicity by C93 in A549 mIκBα compared with A549 empty pcDNA3.1A(−)-transfected cells. Corroborating these results, mIκBα-transfected A549 cells treated with 3 μg/ml C93 for 4 h showed 85.1% reduction in cloning efficiency compared with cells transfected with empty pcDNA3.1A(−) vector (Table 1). Finally, MTS assays showed increased time-dependent cell cytotoxicity by FAS siRNA in A549 mIκBα compared with A549 empty pcDNA3.1A(−) transfected cells (Fig. 3E). These data are consistent with activation of NF-κB having a protective function in the setting of inhibited FAS. Similar results were observed in cultures of cells treated with bortezomib, a 26 S proteasome inhibitor that is believed to block the degradation of IκBα, thus trapping NF-κB in an inactive state in the cytoplasm (24Ma M.H. Yang H.H. Parker K. Manyak S. Friedman J.M. Altamirano C. Wu Z.Q. Borad M.J. Frantzen M. Roussos E. Neeser J. Mikail A. Adams J. Sjak-Shie N. Vescio R.A. Berenson J.R. Clin. Cancer Res. 2003; 9: 1136-1144PubMed Google Scholar). Although bortezomib does not specifically target the NF-κB pathway, the use of this agent does result in a rapid change in NF-κB signaling in cultured cells. Using low doses of bortezomib alone, we observed minimal effects on lung cancer cell survival; for example, at 20 h post-treatment, more than 92% of cells were still viable according to MTS assay results. However, as shown in Fig. 3F, this level of bortezomib results in significant sensitization of A549 and H1975 lung cancer cells to C93. Thus, these experiments are consistent with the results of experiments using mutant IκBα transfection and suggest that activation of NF-κB has a protective effect on lung cancer cells treated with an FAS inhibitor. We then investigated the potential role of COX-2 as a specific NF-κB-regulated transcript in protecting lung cancer cells from the metabolic stress initiated by inhibiting FAS, recognizing that a number of other NF-κB-dependent transcripts could also have cytoprotective effects. First, A549 cells were treated with combinations of C93 and either SC-791 or NS-398, both of which block COX-2 activity. Neither of these COX-2 inhibitors showed a significant effect on cell viability when used alone at low doses (Fig. 4, A and B), but as expected, C93 alone at doses of 3 or 5 μg/ml resulted in decreased cell viability. This C93-induced cell killing was significantly enhanced when cells were co-incubated with either of the COX-2 inhibitors (Fig. 4, A and B). By contrast, adding additional PGE2 to the culture medium offered A549 cells some protection from the C93 exposure (Fig. 4C). Thus, COX-2 probably represents one of the NF-κB-regulated transcripts that mediate the protective response initiated by inhibition of FAS. We then explored the possibility that the activation of NF-κB induced by inhibiting fatty acid synthase is mediated by protein kinase C (PKC), which can be activated by a variety of lipid mediators (25Nishizuka Y. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 484-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (2368) Google Scholar) and in turn is reportedly capable of phosphorylating and inactivating IκBα (26Ghosh S. Baltimore D. Nature. 1990; 344: 678-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (909) Google Scholar, 27Steffan N.M. Bren G.D. Frantz B. Tocci M.J. O'Neill E.A. Paya C.V. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 4685-4691PubMed Google Scholar). We first used isoform-specific antibodies to study localization of two classical PKC isoforms (α and β) and one novel PKC isoform (δ) after treatment with C93 (5 μg/ml) in lung cancer cell lines (Fig. 5). Immunofluorescence images show that PKCα rapidly translocates from the cytoplasm to the nucleus within 1 h of C93 treatment in A549 cells (Fig. 5A). By contrast, PKCβ translocates in the opposite direction, from the nucleus to the cytoplasm (Fig. 5B). Treatment with C93 had no discernible effects on the subcellular distribution of the novel PKCδ isoform (Fig. 5C). These changes in cellular localization are typically indicative of phosphorylation and activation of PKC, and we confirmed that the PKC is phosphorylated after C93 treatment by Western blot analysis using a non-isoform-specific anti-phosphorylated PKC antibody (Fig. 5D). Recognizing that C93 treatment results in changes in the phosphorylation and cellular distribution of PKCα and PKCβ, we next investigated whether these effects on PKC are related to the effects on NF-κB. First, we co-treated cells with combinations of C93 and RO-31-8220, a pharmacological inhibitor of classic PKC isoforms, at a concentration of RO-31-8220 (100 nm) that alone does not affect cell growth. In these experiments, we observed that RO-31-8220 prevented C93-induced translocation of NF-κB to the nucleus (Fig. 5E), and RO-31–8220 also significantly attenuated the rapid C93-dependent increases in mRNA expression of IL-6, IL-8, and COX-2 (Fig. 5F). We further examined the roles of PKCα and PKCβ as activators of NF-κB activity using a luciferase reporter assay that links a firefly luciferase reporter to an NF-κB response element. Using the ratio of firefly luciferase to control Renilla luciferase luminescence as a measure of NF-κB activity, we observed that activation of NF-κB by C93 and PMA was significantly attenuated in cells that were co-transfected with siRNA specific to PKCα (Fig. 5G). By contrast, siRNA to PKCβ appeared to have no significant effects on activation of NF-κB by C93 (Fig. 5G). Together, these results indicate that the activation of NF-κB following inhibition of FAS by C93 is largely a result of PKC (particularly PKCα) activation. siRNA specific to PKCα also prevented C93-induced translocation of NF-κB to the nucleus"
https://openalex.org/W2098012700,"Functional explanations of behaviour often propose optimal strategies for organisms to follow. These ‘best’ strategies could be difficult to perform given biological constraints such as neural architecture and physiological constraints. Instead, simple heuristics or ‘rules-of-thumb’ that approximate these optimal strategies may instead be performed. From a modelling perspective, rules-of-thumb are also useful tools for considering how group behaviour is shaped by the behaviours of individuals. Using simple rules-of-thumb reduces the complexity of these models, but care needs to be taken to use rules that are biologically relevant. Here, we investigate the similarity between the outputs of a two-player dynamic foraging game (which generated optimal but complex solutions) and a computational simulation of the behaviours of the two members of a foraging pair, who instead followed a rule-of-thumb approximation of the game's output. The original game generated complex results, and we demonstrate here that the simulations following the much-simplified rules-of-thumb also generate complex results, suggesting that the rule-of-thumb was sufficient to make some of the model outcomes unpredictable. There was some agreement between both modelling techniques, but some differences arose – particularly when pair members were not identical in how they gained and lost energy. We argue that exploring how rules-of-thumb perform in comparison to their optimal counterparts is an important exercise for biologically validating the output of agent-based models of group behaviour."
https://openalex.org/W2170014646,"Past anthrax attacks in the United States have highlighted the need for improved measures against bioweapons. The virulence of anthrax stems from the shielding properties of the Bacillus anthracis poly-γ-d-glutamic acid capsule. In the presence of excess CapD, a B. anthracis γ-glutamyl transpeptidase, the protective capsule is degraded, and the immune system can successfully combat infection. Although CapD shows promise as a next generation protein therapeutic against anthrax, improvements in production, stability, and therapeutic formulation are needed. In this study, we addressed several of these problems through computational protein engineering techniques. We show that circular permutation of CapD improved production properties and dramatically increased kinetic thermostability. At 45 °C, CapD was completely inactive after 5 min, but circularly permuted CapD remained almost entirely active after 30 min. In addition, we identify an amino acid substitution that dramatically decreased transpeptidation activity but not hydrolysis. Subsequently, we show that this mutant had a diminished capsule degradation activity, suggesting that CapD catalyzes capsule degradation through a transpeptidation reaction with endogenous amino acids and peptides in serum rather than hydrolysis."
https://openalex.org/W2000292765,"Analysis of biological processes is frequently performed with the help of phenotypic assays where data is mostly acquired in single end-point analysis. Alternative phenotypic profiling techniques are desired where time-series information is essential to the biological question, for instance to differentiate early and late regulators of cell proliferation in loss-of-function studies. So far there is no study addressing this question despite of high unmet interests, mostly due to the limitation of conventional end-point assaying technologies. We present the first human kinome screen with a real-time cell analysis system (RTCA) to capture dynamic RNAi phenotypes, employing time-resolved monitoring of cell proliferation via electrical impedance. RTCA allowed us to investigate the dynamics of phenotypes of cell proliferation instead of using conventional end-point analysis. By introducing data transformation with first-order derivative, i.e. the cell-index growth rate, we demonstrate this system suitable for high-throughput screenings (HTS). The screen validated previously identified inhibitor genes and, additionally, identified activators of cell proliferation. With the information of time kinetics available, we could establish a network of mitotic-event related genes to be among the first displaying inhibiting effects after RNAi knockdown. The time-resolved screen captured kinetics of cell proliferation caused by RNAi targeting human kinome, serving as a resource for researchers. Our work establishes RTCA technology as a novel robust tool with biological and pharmacological relevance amenable for high-throughput screening."
https://openalex.org/W2022714278,"Background There are a number of sound justifications for publishing nearly identical information in Chinese and English medical journals, assuming several conditions are met. Although overlap publication is perceived as undesirable and ethically questionable in Europe and North America, it may serve an important function in some regions where English is not the native tongue. There is no empirical data on the nature and degree of overlap publication in English and Chinese language journals. Methods/Principal Findings A random sample of 100 English manuscripts from Chinese institutions was selected from PubMed. Key words and institutions were searched in the China National Knowledge Infrastructure, a comprehensive Chinese language research database. Unacknowledged overlap was a priori defined according to International Committee of Medical Journal Editor (ICMJE) guidelines following examination by two individuals. 19% (95% CI 11–27) of English manuscripts from Chinese institutions were found to have substantial overlap with Chinese published work based on full text examination. None of the manuscripts met all of the criteria established by the ICMJE for an acknowledged overlap publication. Individual-level, journal-level, and institutional factors seem to influence overlap publication. Manuscripts associated with an institution outside of China and with more than one institution were significantly less likely to have substantial overlap (p<0.05). Conclusions/Significance Overlap publication was common in this context, but instances of standard ICMJE notations to acknowledge this practice were rare. This research did not cite the identified overlap manuscripts with the hope that these empirical data will inform journal policy changes and structural initiatives to promote clearer policies and manuscripts."
