https://openalex.org/W2060680089,"The future adequacy of freshwater resources is difficult to assess, owing to a complex and rapidly changing geography of water supply and use. Numerical experiments combining climate model outputs, water budgets, and socioeconomic information along digitized river networks demonstrate that (i) a large proportion of the world's population is currently experiencing water stress and (ii) rising water demands greatly outweigh greenhouse warming in defining the state of global water systems to 2025. Consideration of direct human impacts on global water supply remains a poorly articulated but potentially important facet of the larger global change question."
https://openalex.org/W2130256070,"Recent reconstructions of Northern Hemisphere temperatures and climate forcing over the past 1000 years allow the warming of the 20th century to be placed within a historical context and various mechanisms of climate change to be tested. Comparisons of observations with simulations from an energy balance climate model indicate that as much as 41 to 64% of preanthropogenic (pre-1850) decadal-scale temperature variations was due to changes in solar irradiance and volcanism. Removal of the forced response from reconstructed temperature time series yields residuals that show similar variability to those of control runs of coupled models, thereby lending support to the models' value as estimates of low-frequency variability in the climate system. Removal of all forcing except greenhouse gases from the approximately 1000-year time series results in a residual with a very large late-20th-century warming that closely agrees with the response predicted from greenhouse gas forcing. The combination of a unique level of temperature increase in the late 20th century and improved constraints on the role of natural variability provides further evidence that the greenhouse effect has already established itself above the level of natural variability in the climate system. A 21st-century global warming projection far exceeds the natural variability of the past 1000 years and is greater than the best estimate of global temperature change for the last interglacial."

Here, we show that the ank locus encodes a multipass transmembrane protein (ANK) that is expressed in joints and other tissues and controls pyrophosphate levels in cultured cells. A highly conserved gene is present in humans and other vertebrates. These results identify ANK-mediated control of pyrophosphate levels as a possible mechanism regulating tissue calcification and susceptibility to arthritis in higher animals."

Although ACC has often been proposed to be a major rate-controlling enzyme of this pathway, no direct tests of this proposal in vivo have been reported. We have tested this proposal in Escherichia coli.The genes encoding the four subunits of E. coli ACC were cloned in a single plasmid under the control of a bacteriophage T7 promoter. Upon induction of gene expression, the four ACC subunits were overproduced in equimolar amounts. Overproduction of the proteins resulted in greatly increased ACC activity with a concomitant increase in the intracellular level of malonyl-CoA. The effects of ACC overexpression on the rate of fatty acid synthesis were examined in the presence of a thioesterase, which provided a metabolic sink for fatty acid overproduction. Under these conditions ACC overproduction resulted in a 6-fold increase in the rate of fatty acid synthesis.

Acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC)1 catalyzes the first committed step of the fatty acid synthetic pathway, the formation of malonyl-CoA from acetyl-CoA plus bicarbonate, and ACC has often been postulated to be a rate-controlling step in fatty acid biosynthesis (see, e.g., Refs. 1Kim K.H. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 1997; 17: 77-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar and 2Munday M.R. Hemingway C.J. Adv. Enzyme. Regul. 1999; 39: 205-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Consistent with this hypothesis, the activity of ACC, the rates of fatty acid synthesis, and the levels of malonyl-CoA are known to be well correlated during hormonal treatments of mammalian tissues (1Kim K.H. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 1997; 17: 77-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar, 2Munday M.R. Hemingway C.J. Adv. Enzyme. Regul. 1999; 39: 205-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). However, interpretation of these data is greatly complicated by the recent discovery of a second ACC isoform present in mitochondria (3Abu-Elheiga L. Brinkley W.R. Zhong L. Chirala S.S. Woldegiorgis G. Wakil S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 1444-1449Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). Data obtained by use of ACC inhibitors in isolated chloroplasts are also consistent with a regulatory role for ACC in this fatty acid synthetic system (4Page R.A. Okada S. Harwood J.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1210: 369-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), although no data on chloroplast malonyl-CoA concentrations were reported. The role of ACC in determining the rate of fatty acid synthesis in vivo seems to remain an open question. As first pointed out by Walsh and Koshland (5Walsh K. Koshland Jr., D.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 3577-3581Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), a direct means to approachin vivo pathway regulation is to overproduce candidate enzyme(s) and measure the effect on the flux through the pathway. However, we know of no example in any organism where this approach has been utilized for ACC. A test of the rate-controlling nature of ACCin vivo requires significantly increased levels of ACC activity as well as a metabolic sink (6Fell D.A. Understanding the Control of Metabolism. Portland Press, London1996Google Scholar) for the overproduced fatty acid molecules. Provision of an appropriate sink precludes the possibility that complex lipid synthesis (or the capacity of cell membrane bilayers) could limit the rate of fatty acid synthesis. We have chosen the bacterium Escherichia coli to test if increased ACC activity results in increased rates of fatty acid synthesis. This organism has several experimental advantages. First, the E. coli ACC genes and proteins are well studied (7Alberts A. Vagelos P.R. Boyer P.D. The Enzymes. 6. Academic Press, New York1972: 37-82Google Scholar, 8Guchhait R.B. Polakis S.E.

Chem. 1998; 273: 19140-19145Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) and the enzyme does not appear to be regulated by small molecules (7Alberts A. Vagelos P.R. Boyer P.D. The Enzymes. 6. Academic Press, New York1972: 37-82Google Scholar). Second, in the presence of high levels of cytosolic thioesterase activity, newly synthesized fatty acids are released into the culture medium in a nonesterified form (as free fatty acids) (14Cho H. Cronan Jr., J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4216-4219Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar), thus providing an appropriate metabolic sink (6Fell D.A. Understanding the Control of Metabolism. Portland Press, London1996Google Scholar). Third, E. colihas only a single ACC and fatty acid synthesis is the only pathway that consumes malonyl-CoA (10Li S.J. Cronan Jr., J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 855-863Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These attributes are demonstrated by the temperature-sensitive growth and fatty acid synthesis of mutant strains having temperature-sensitive mutations in genes encoding ACC subunits (10Li S.J. Cronan Jr., J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 855-863Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Harder M.E. Beacham I.R. Cronan Jr., J.E. Beacham K. Honegger J.L. Silbert D.F. Proc. Natl. Acad.

Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 5755-5757Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Finally, the expression levels of the genes encoding the ACC subunits are known to be regulated by the cellular growth rate (12Li S.J. Cronan Jr., J.E. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 332-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) and the pools of malonyl-CoA and fatty acid synthetic intermediates are extremely small (19Heath R.J. Rock C.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15531-15538Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 20Heath R.J. Rock C.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1833-1836Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Both of these findings implicate ACC as a possible rate-controlling step. The ACC reaction consists of two discrete half-reactions (Fig.1) (7Alberts A. Vagelos P.R. Boyer P.D. The Enzymes. 6. Academic Press, New York1972: 37-82Google Scholar, 8Guchhait R.B. Polakis S.E.

Chem. 1998; 273: 19140-19145Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). In the first half-reaction, biotin is carboxylated by bicarbonate in an ATP-dependent reaction to form carboxybiotin, whereas in the second half-reaction, the carboxyl group is transferred from carboxybiotin to acetyl-CoA to form malonyl-CoA (9Polakis S.E. Guchhait R.B. Zwerget E.E. Lane M.D. Cooper T.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 6657-6667Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In E. coli these half-reactions are catalyzed by different components of a large enzyme complex. The biotin carboxylase component (8Guchhait R.B. Polakis S.E. Dimroth P. Stoll E. Moss J. Lane M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 6633-6645Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Li S.J. Cronan Jr., J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 855-863Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), is responsible for the first half-reaction while carboxyltransfer is catalyzed by a complex of two different proteins (called α and β) (11Li S.J. Cronan Jr., J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16841-16847Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Blanchard C.Z. Waldrop G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19140-19145Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Although in vitro free biotin functions (albeit very inefficiently) in both half-reactions (7Alberts A. Vagelos P.R. Boyer P.D. The Enzymes. 6.

Cronan Jr., J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16841-16847Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), in vivo function requires that the biotin moiety be covalently attached to a fourth protein, biotin carboxyl carrier protein (BCCP) (7Alberts A. Vagelos P.R. Boyer P.D. The Enzymes. 6. Academic Press, New York1972: 37-82Google Scholar, 9Polakis S.E. Guchhait R.B. Zwerget E.E. Lane M.D. Cooper T.G. J. Biol.

Chem. 1992; 267: 855-863Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the sole biotinylated protein of the organism. We have simultaneously overproduced all four ACC subunit proteins in a coordinated manner and report that overproduction results in a significant increase in the rate of fatty acid synthesis. Strain BL21(DE3) containing DE3, a prophage carrying the T7 RNA polymerase gene (21Studier F.W. Rosenberg A.H. Dunn J.J. Dubendorff J.W. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 185: 60-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (5981) Google Scholar), was used for overexpression studies. The medium was rich broth (per liter; 10 g of tryptone, 1 g of yeast extract, 5 g of NaCl). ThepanD2 allele was transferred into various strains via P1 phage-mediated transduction from strain SJ16 (23Subrahamaman S. Cronan Jr., J.E. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 4596-4602Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 24Jackowski S. Rock C.O. J. Bacteriol. 1981; 148: 926-932Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). All cultures were grown at 37 °C. Plasmid pMSD1 was constructed by inserting a 800-base pair pLS182 (10Li S.J. Cronan Jr., J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 855-863Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) KpnI-SalI DNA fragment containing the accB gene into the same sites of pFN476 (22Sankar P. Hutton E. Van Bogelen R.A. Clark R.L. Neidhardt F.C. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 5145-5152Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Plasmid pMSD4 resulted from insertion of a 4.2-kilobase pair XbaI-SalI accD DNA fragment from pPJ10 into the same sites of pFN476. Plasmid pMSD6 was made by inserting the 2.8-kilobase pair accBC SacI-XbaI DNA fragment of pLS182 (10Li S.J. Cronan Jr., J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 855-863Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) between the same sites of pFN476. A 4.2-kilobase pair XbaI-SalI DNA fragment of pPJ10 containing the accD gene and the downstream folCgene was inserted into the same sites of pMSD6 to give plasmid pMSD7 (accBCD plus folC). The accA gene was inserted into the SphI site of pMSD7 (a secondSphI was added by subcloning the pLS151 (11Li S.J. Cronan Jr., J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16841-16847Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)XhoI-SacI accA gene fragment into an intermediate polylinker plasmid). The final plasmid (pMSD8) has the four acetyl-CoA carboxylase genes in the order accBCDA withfolC inserted between the accD andaccA genes. Plasmid pMSD15 was constructed by ligation of the HindIII-BamHI vector fragment of the pACYC184 derivative pCY216 (25Chapman-Smith A. Turner D.L. Cronan Jr., J.E. Morris T.W. Wallace J.C. Biochem. J. 1994; 302: 881-887Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar) to the HindIII-BamHI′tesA fragment of pHC122 (14Cho H. Cronan Jr., J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4216-4219Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). In later experiments the instability of plasmid pMSD8 was countered by introduction of the compatible lacI plasmid, pREP4 (Qiagen). Cell extracts were prepared by harvesting the cultures by centrifugation, resuspension of the cells in a minimal volume of 2 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0), followed by disruption by passage twice through a French pressure cell followed by centrifugation. Biotin carboxylase activity was assayed by its forward model reaction, the carboxylation of biotin by potassium [14C]bicarbonate (8Guchhait R.B. Polakis S.E. Dimroth P. Stoll E. Moss J. Lane M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 6633-6645Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Carboxyltransferase activity was assayed (following ammonium sulfate fractionation to remove an inhibitor; Ref. 8Guchhait R.B. Polakis S.E. Dimroth P. Stoll E. Moss J. Lane M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 6633-6645Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) by its reverse reaction, decarboxylation of [2-14C]malonyl-CoA with biotin methyl ester as the acceptor (7Alberts A. Vagelos P.R. Boyer P.D. The Enzymes. 6. Academic Press, New York1972: 37-82Google Scholar, 8Guchhait R.B. Polakis S.E. Dimroth P. Stoll E. Moss J. Lane M.D. J. Biol.

Acetyl-CoA carboxylase was assayed by the acetyl-CoA-dependent incorporation of14CO2 from [14C]bicarbonate into the acid-stable product, malonyl-CoA (26Harwood J.L. Walsh M.C. Walker K.A. Dey P.M. Harbone J.B. Methods in Plant Biochemistry. Academic Press, London1990: 96-110Google Scholar). The reaction mixture (total volume 0.2 ml) contained 0.1 m Tricine-KOH buffer (pH 8.0), 1 mm ATP, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 100 mm KCl, 39 mm NaH14CO2(1.17 μCi), 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.3 mmacetyl-CoA, and up to 0.2 mg of cell-free extract protein. The CoA metabolite pools were labeled with β-[3H]alanine by use of apanD strain (19Heath R.J. Rock C.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15531-15538Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 22Sankar P. Hutton E. Van Bogelen R.A. Clark R.L. Neidhardt F.C. J.

Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 4596-4602Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) which greatly facilitates detection and quantitation. Strains were grown overnight in minimal E salts enriched with 0.2% vitamin-free casein hydrolysate, 0.4% glucose, and 1 mm β-[3-3H]alanine. The cultures were centrifuged and the cells resuspended in fresh medium and grown until mid-log phase. The cultures were then either treated with cerulenin (0.1 mg/ml) or IPTG (1 mm) or both. As described previously (23Subrahamaman S. Cronan Jr., J.E. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 4596-4602Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), following induction the cells were treated with trichloroacetic acid; a mixture of unlabeled CoA, malonyl-CoA, and acetyl-CoA were added as internal standards (these were detected by UV absorption); and the CoA compounds were separated and quantitated. Intracellular malonyl-CoA concentrations were calculated from the efficiency of counting and cell numbers. Labeling of lipids with [1-14C]acetate and thin layer chromatography were performed as described previously (27Gelmann E.P. Cronan Jr., J.E. J. Bacteriol. 1972; 112: 381-387Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), followed by PhosphorImager analysis. The accA,accB, accC, and accD genes encode the four ACC subunits: carboxyltransferase α, BCCP, biotin carboxylase, and carboxyltransferase β, respectively. The accB andaccC genes comprise a bicistronic operon (10Li S.J. Cronan Jr., J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 855-863Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Li S.J. Cronan Jr., J.E. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 332-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar), whereas the genes encoding the carboxyltransferase subunits are far removed both from these genes and one another (11Li S.J. Cronan Jr., J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16841-16847Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In order to overexpress ACC activity, we constructed a synthetic operon containing all four genes under control of a bacteriophage T7 promoter (21Studier F.W. Rosenberg A.H. Dunn J.J. Dubendorff J.W. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 185: 60-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (5981) Google Scholar). A fifth unrelated gene, folC, which lies adjacent to accD in the genome, was included as an internal standard for protein production. We chose to express the acc genes from a phage T7 promoter rather than the native promoters or other E. coli promoters for several reasons. First, in preliminary work we had found that transformation of two compatible high copy number plasmids, one carrying accA and accD and the otheraccB and accC, into the same host strain was very inefficient (data not shown). Since transformants carrying either plasmid alone were readily obtained, this result suggested that overproduction of abnormal ratios of the four proteins was toxic to cell growth. To counter this apparent toxicity and to obtain stoichiometric production of the ACC subunits, we cloned the fouracc genes in a low copy number vector and triggered overproduction by use of the tightly controlled phage T7 transcription system (21Studier F.W. Rosenberg A.H. Dunn J.J. Dubendorff J.W. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 185: 60-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (5981) Google Scholar). The T7 promoter plasmid, pFN476 (22Sankar P. Hutton E. Van Bogelen R.A. Clark R.L. Neidhardt F.C. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 5145-5152Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), was chosen due to its low copy number (1–5 copies/cell). The high transcriptional efficiency (21Studier F.W. Rosenberg A.H. Dunn J.J. Dubendorff J.W. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 185: 60-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (5981) Google Scholar) of T7 RNA polymerase and the insensitivity of this polymerase to transcriptional polarity and to most E. colitranscriptional terminators (28Lyakhov D.L. He B. Zhang X. Studier F.W. Dunn J.J. McAllister W.T. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 280: 201-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 29Jeng S.T. Gardner J.F. Gumport R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 19306-19312Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) were expected to result in equimolar production of the four subunits. Induction by addition of IPTG of this synthetic operon slowed growth of the bacterial strain, but no loss of colony-forming ability was seen. We assayed the relative production of the four ACC subunits by labeling induced cultures with a mixture of 35S-labeled methionine and cysteine in the presence of rifampicin, a specific inhibitor of E. coli RNA polymerase, such that only gene products expressed from a T7 promoter are 35S-labeled (21Studier F.W. Rosenberg A.H. Dunn J.J. Dubendorff J.W. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 185: 60-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (5981) Google Scholar). The labeled proteins were then separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and the radioactivity in each band was quantitated using the FolC protein as an internal standard. The relative molar values obtained for the four ACC subunits were: AccB, 1.0; AccC, 0.99; AccA, 1.13; and AccD, 0.95. It should be noted that another enzyme is required for ACC activity, the biotin protein ligase that attaches the biotin moiety of BCCP (25Chapman-Smith A. Turner D.L. Cronan Jr., J.E. Morris T.W. Wallace J.C. Biochem. J. 1994; 302: 881-887Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). In some experiments we overexpressed the E. coli biotin protein ligase from a compatible plasmid prior to induction of ACC overexpression. This gave only a modest increase in ACC specific activity, indicating that ligase was not severely limiting during the brief induction of ACC overexpression, and thus the biotin ligase plasmid was omitted in order to simplify the experiments. The overproduced ACC proteins were highly active in both half-reactions (Table I). We also compared extracts of induced cultures that overproduced subsets of the ACC proteins. The biotin carboxylase activities observed upon overexpression ofaccC alone or in combination with the other subunits were several orders of magnitude greater than those of non-overproducing strains, and increased activities were observed when several subunits were overexpressed; these results are consistent with formation of a protein complex. Similar results were obtained for the carboxyltransferase activity. The most striking result was seen when the overall ACC reaction, conversion of acetyl-CoA to malonyl-CoA, was assayed (Table I). Extracts of strains that overproduced all four subunits had readily detectable ACC activities, whereas, in agreement with prior work (7Alberts A. Vagelos P.R. Boyer P.D. The Enzymes. 6. Academic Press, New York1972: 37-82Google Scholar, 8Guchhait R.B. Polakis S.E. Dimroth P. Stoll E. Moss J. Lane M.D. J. Biol.

Acta. 1976; 450: 475-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), no activity could be detected in extracts of wild type strains (the ACC complex is believed to be unstable at the low subunit concentrations of crude extract). Extracts of strains that overproduced only one or two subunits also had no detectable ACC activity. Surprisingly, a strain that overproduced only the AccB, AccC, and AccD proteins had ACC activity despite the lack of AccA overproduction (Table I). The product of these reactions was identified as malonyl-CoA by HPLC analysis (see below) and its function as a substrate for rat liver fatty acid synthase and 3-ketoacyl-acyl carrier protein (ACP) synthases I and II of E. coli (data not shown).Table IACC enzyme activities upon ACC protein overproductionPlasmid-borne acc genesBiotin carboxylaseCarboxyltransferaseAcetyl-CoA carboxylaseNone0.0040.021<0.01ANT1-aNT, not tested.NT<0.01B0.0020.022<0.01C2.04NT<0.01DNT14.87<0.01BCNTNT0.01ADNT25.01<0.01BCD4.23NT0.11ABCD4.6328.370.50The enzyme activities were assayed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” All activities are given as nanomoles of14CO2 fixed (for biotin carboxylase and acetyl-CoA carboxylase activities) or of 14CO2 released (for the carboxyltransferase back reaction) min−1 mg−1 of protein.

Each assay was repeated at least twice on independently grown cultures. The production of ACC activity observed by enzyme assay indicated that the intracellular pools of malonyl-CoA should be increased. In these experiments a panD mutation was introduced into all strains in order to confer β-alanine auxotrophy and allow uniform labeling of the pools of CoA and its thioesters with the CoA precursor, β-[3H]alanine (19Heath R.J. Rock C.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15531-15538Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar,20Heath R.J. Rock C.O. J. Biol.

Following induction of ACC overproduction, the cellular CoA compounds were extracted, separated by reverse phase HPLC, and quantitated by in-line scintillation counting. As expected, cultures that overproduced ACC also overproduced malonyl-CoA (Fig.2). A readily detectable level of malonyl-CoA (17.7% of the total CoA compounds, a calculated intracellular concentration of 13.3 μm) was observed upon overproduction (Fig. 2 C), whereas strains having normal ACC levels contained barely detectable malonyl-CoA levels (0.01% of the total CoA metabolite pool) (Fig. 2 A). Similarly low levels of malonyl-CoA in wild type E. coli cells were reported by Heath and Rock (19Heath R.J. Rock C.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15531-15538Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), who also reported accumulation of much larger pools of malonyl-CoA when fatty acid synthesis is blocked by addition of cerulenin. This inhibitor specifically blocks 3-ketoacyl-ACP synthases I and II, the enzymes primarily responsible for addition of malonate-derived carbon atoms to the elongating fatty acyl chains. Addition of cerulenin to strains having normal ACC levels increased the malonyl-CoA pools to 10% of the total CoA compounds (Fig.2 B). In contrast, addition of cerulenin to cultures induced for ACC overproduction gave a very large increase in malonyl-CoA at the expense of acetyl-CoA, such that malonyl-CoA comprised more than half (55.1%) of the total CoA metabolites (Fig. 2 D). These results indicate that the overproduced ACC proteins are active in vivo. Moreover, the increased malonyl-CoA levels observed upon blocking fatty acid synthesis in cells overproducing ACC suggested that, in the absence of cerulenin, malonyl-CoA was consumed by fatty acid synthesis at an accelerated rate. To test this indirect indication of increased fatty acid synthesis, we directly measured fatty acid synthesis. Incorporation of [14C]acetate is the preferred method for quantitation of fatty acid synthetic rates in vivo, but since acetyl-CoA is a central metabolic intermediate, these pools can change upon metabolic manipulations (31Jiang P. Cronan Jr., J.E. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 2814-2821Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Alterations of the endogenous acetyl-CoA pool would then change the effective specific activity of the acetyl-CoA utilized in fatty acid synthesis, resulting in misleading synthetic rates. A dual label experiment was performed to determine if ACC overproduction altered the specific activity of the acetyl-CoA pool synthesized in the presence of [1-14C]acetate. The experiment of Fig. 2 was repeated except that cultures were grown with β-[3H]alanine and briefly labeled with [1-14C]acetate in the presence or absence of ACC overproduction and the (3H:14C) ratios of the two isotopes were determined for the acetyl-CoA produced. The ratio for cells having normal levels of ACC was 1.15 to 1, while cells that overproduced ACC had a virtually identical3H:14C ratio (1.11 to 1). These data indicated that the rate of incorporation of this precursor was a valid measure of the rate of fatty acid synthesis under these conditions. As noted above, a valid test of the effects of ACC overproduction on the rate of fatty acid synthesis requires that the products can accumulate without limitation. We therefore uncoupled fatty acid synthesis from phospholipid synthesis by overproduction of a mutant form of E. coli thioesterase I (14Cho H. Cronan Jr., J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4216-4219Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Thioesterase I (encoded by the tesA gene) is normally a periplasmic enzyme, but the mutant protein (called ′TesA) lacks the leader peptide, thereby blocking export of the enzyme to the cellular periplasm. The ′TesA enzyme remains in the cytosol, where it cleaves the long chain acyl-ACP intermediates of fatty acid synthesis (14Cho H. Cronan Jr., J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4216-4219Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). The resulting free fatty acids are found in the culture medium (14Cho H. Cronan Jr., J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4216-4219Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar); hence, production of the mutant thioesterase would direct any overproduced fatty acids to an ideal (6Fell D.A. Understanding the Control of Metabolism. Portland Press, London1996Google Scholar) high capacity metabolic sink, the culture medium. In these experiments the ′TesA thioesterase was induced by addition of arabinose (14Cho H. Cronan Jr., J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4216-4219Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). ACC overproduction was subsequently induced and the rate of fatty acid synthesis was followed by labeling the cultures with [1-14C]acetate. The lipids were then extracted from the total culture (cells plus medium), separated by thin layer chromatography (Fig. 3), and the incorporated radioactivity determined. ACC overproduction increased the rate of free fatty acid synthesis (Fig. 3 and TableII). Strains that overexpressed only AccBCD also showed an increased rate of free fatty acid synthesis relative to strains that produced only ′TesA. When compared with the strain expressing the mutant thioesterase, but having a normal level of ACC, overproduction of ACC gave increased rates of 5.7 ± 1.2-fold when all four subunits were overexpressed and 2.5 ± 0.5-fold when only the AccBCD subunits were overexpressed. The observed increase in the rate of free fatty acid production indicates that ACC overproduction increased the flux through the fatty acid synthetic pathway. It should be noted that ACC overproduction also partially reversed the inhibition of phospholipid synthesis (14Cho H. Cronan Jr., J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4216-4219Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar) that resulted from ′TesA expression (Fig. 3), suggesting that the increased rate of fatty acid synthesis allows a larger fraction of the overproduced long chain acyl-ACP intermediates to escape cleavage by the thioesterase and become incorporated into phospholipids.Table IIFatty acid synthesis in strains overproducing ACCPlasmid-borne acc genes′TesATime of labeling2-aThe times given are hours after addition of IPTG.

Open table in a new tab Amino acid starvation of E. colitriggers a complex pattern of metabolic adjustments called the stringent response, which results in inhibition of phospholipid synthesis as well as other processes such as stable RNA synthesis (32Cashel M. Gentry D.R. Hernandez V.J. Vinella D. Neidhardt F.C. Curtiss III, R. Ingraham J.L. Lin E.C.C. Low K.B. Magasanik B. Reznikoff W.S. Riley M. Schaechter M. Umbarger H.E. Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium: Cellular and Molecular Biology. 2nd Ed. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1996: 1458-1496Google Scholar). This response is mediated by the rapid accumulation of the guanosine alarmones, guanosine-5′-triphosphate-3′-diphosphate and guanosine-5′-diphosphate-3′-diphosphate, collectively called (p)ppGpp. Polaskis and co-workers (33Polakis S.E. Guchhait R.B. Lane M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1973; 248: 7957-7966Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) have attributed the inhibition of phospholipid synthesis during amino acid starvation to inhibition of ACC by the guanosine alarmones since (p)ppGpp was found to inhibit the carboxyltransferase half-reaction in vitro (the overall ACC reaction was not tested). Moreover, guanosine 5′-diphosphate 3′-diphosphate inhibition of the P. citronellolis ACC reaction has been reported (30Fall R.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1976; 450: 475-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The physiological relevance of these observations has been questioned, most recently by Heath and co-workers (35Heath R.J. Jackowski S. Rock C.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26584-26590Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), who showed that overproduction ofsn-glycerol 3-phosphate acyltransferase, the first enzyme of phospholipid synthesis, substantially restored the rate of phospholipid synthesis in cells containing high concentrations of (p)ppGpp. However, in that study phospholipid synthesis was not completely restored and thus an effect on fatty acid synthesis remained possible. We tested the effects of the stringent response on fatty acid synthesis per se by generating high intracellular levels of (p)ppGpp by use of a plasmid that overexpressed (p)ppGpp synthase I, the relA gene product, under a tac promoter. The plasmid used was compatible with the plasmids used for ACC overproduction and for ′TesA production, and thus various combinations of plasmids could be tested. First, overproduction of ACC failed to reverse the inhibition of phospholipid synthesis resulting from induction of (p)ppGpp accumulation (detected by inhibition of growth). However, since this result could be due to the reported effect onsn-glycerol 3-phosphate acyltransferase (35Heath R.J. Jackowski S. Rock C.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26584-26590Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we introduced the ′TesA production plasmid and examined free fatty acid production during the stringent response in the presence or absence of ACC overproduction (Fig. 4). The accumulation of (p)ppGpp had no detectable effect on the rate of free fatty acid synthesis either in the presence or absence of ACC overproduction. We therefore conclude that the in vitro inhibition of ACC by the guanosine alarmones is not physiologically relevant. A plausible explanation for the observed enzyme inhibition (30Fall R.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1976; 450: 475-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 33Polakis S.E. Guchhait R.B. Lane M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1973; 248: 7957-7966Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) is that (p)ppGpp may compete with the substrate CoA esters since adenosine 5′-monophosphate-3′-monophosphate, a molecule structurally similar to (p)ppGpp, is a potent inhibitor of many enzymes that utilize CoA and its thioesters. Our finding that the rate of fatty acid synthesis can be increased by overexpression of ACC does not agree with the strict tenants of metabolic control analysis (6Fell D.A. Understanding the Control of Metabolism. Portland Press, London1996Google Scholar, 36Heinrich R. Schuster S. The Regulation of Cellular Systems. Chapman and Hall, New York1996Crossref Google Scholar). This analytical approach holds that the control of a pathway is spread among the component enzymes such that increased activity of one enzyme will not result in increased flux through a pathway (6Fell D.A. Understanding the Control of Metabolism. Portland Press, London1996Google Scholar, 36Heinrich R. Schuster S. The Regulation of Cellular Systems. Chapman and Hall, New York1996Crossref Google Scholar). Metabolic control analysis has done a valuable service in countering the classical idea of a rate-limiting step in which one enzyme determines the rate of a pathway. However, in addition to the present case, there are several well documented examples in which increased activity of one or two enzymes does increase the flux through a pathway in E. coli. In early work, Walsh and Koshland (5Walsh K. Koshland Jr., D.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 3577-3581Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) showed that increased citrate synthase activity increased the flux through the tricarboxylic acid cycle. More recently succinate production by E. coli was shown to increase upon overproduction of phosphoenolphosphate carboxylase (37Millard C.S. Chao Y.-P. Liao J.C. Donnelly M.I. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1996; 62: 1808-1810Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and increased rates of glycolytic flux resulted from increased pyruvate kinase levels (38Emmerling M. Bailey J.E. Sauer U. Biotechnol. Bioeng. 2000; 67: 623-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Similar results have been obtained for the aromatic amino acid synthetic pathway (39Liao J.C. Hou S.-Y. Chao Y.-P. Biotechnol. Bioeng. 1996; 52: 129-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Therefore, it seems that there are pathways including fatty acid synthesis in which the situation is intermediate between the two extreme views: that of the classical rate-limiting step and that of metabolic control analysis. However, in qualitative agreement with metabolic control analysis, the 100-fold increase in intracellular malonyl-CoA levels upon ACC overproduction gave only a 6-fold increase in the rate of free fatty acid synthesis (Fig. 2), indicating that steps later in the pathway limit the flux through the pathway. Indeed, Health and Rock (19Heath R.J. Rock C.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15531-15538Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 40Heath R.J. Rock C.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10996-11000Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar) have reported that the activities of enoyl reductase and 3-ketoacyl-ACP synthase III regulate the rate of fatty acid synthesis in an in vitro reconstituted E. coli fatty acid synthetic system. From the efficiency of counting and cell numbers, we calculate an intracellular malonyl-CoA concentration of 13.3 μm for the induced culture of the ACC overproduction strain (Fig. 3 C), which is similar to the Michaelis constant (41Joshi V.C. Wakil S.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1971; 143: 493-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) for the next enzyme of the pathway, malonyl-CoA:ACP transacylase, and therefore the limitation must be later in the pathway."

This has deleterious effects on living organisms, such as DNA damage. When exposed to elevated ultraviolet-B radiation (UV-B; 280-315 nm), plants display a wide variety of physiological and morphological responses characterized as acclimation and adaptation. Here we show, using special sun simulators, that elevated solar UV-B doses increase the frequency of somatic homologous DNA rearrangements in Arabidopsis and tobacco plants. Increases in recombination are accompanied by a strong induction of photolyase and Rad51 gene expression. These genes are putatively involved in major DNA repair pathways, photoreactivation and recombination repair. In mutant Arabidopsis plants that are deficient in photoreactivating ultraviolet-induced cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers, recombination under elevated UV-B regimes greatly exceeds wild-type levels. Our results show that homologous recombination repair pathways might be involved in eliminating UV-B-induced DNA lesions in plants. Thus, increases in terrestrial solar UV-B radiation as forecasted for the early 21st century may affect genome stability in plants."

Since the beginning of the 1990s, the three-dimensional structures of an impressive number of lipases from mammalian, yeast, and microbial origin have been determined (1Borgström B. Brockman H.L.

In particular, structures of fungal and bacterial lipases have attracted interest because these enzymes are applied on a large scale in detergents and for stereoselective biotransformations. Their wide-spread biotechnological application is related to their cofactor independence, their broad substrate specificity, their high enantio-selectivity, and their stability in organic solvents (4Jaeger K.-E. Reetz M.T. Trends Biotechnol. 1998; 16: 396-403Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (879) Google Scholar). Bacterial lipases have recently been classified into eight different families, with family I being the largest and consisting of six subfamilies (5Arpigny J.L. Jaeger K.-E. Biochem. J. 1999; 343: 177-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (1021) Google Scholar). Families I.1 and I.2 contain lipases from the genusPseudomonas. These lipases usually show pronounced differences in regio- and enantio-selectivity despite a high degree of amino acid sequence homology (more than 40%) (6Gilbert E.J. Enzyme Microb. Technol. 1993; 15: 634-645Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 7Svendsen A. Borch K. Barfoed M. Nielsen T.B. Gormsen E. Patkar S.A. Biochim. Biophys.

They are widely used in industry, especially for the production of chiral chemicals that serve as basic building blocks in the synthesis of pharmaceuticals, pesticides, and insecticides (8Theil F. Chem. Rev. 1995; 95: 2203-2227Crossref Scopus (299) Google Scholar). The prototype enzyme of family I.1 is the 29-kDa extracellular lipase from Pseudomonas aeruginosa, which was the firstPseudomonas lipase to be purified to electrophoretic homogeneity (9Stuer W.

(i) It plays an important role as a virulence factor of P. aeruginosa, which is an opportunistic pathogen, causing a variety of infectious diseases in immuno-compromised patients. This lipase can act synergistically with other lipolytic enzymes, leading to damage of host cellular membrane lipids including lung surfactants (10Jaeger K.-E. Immun.

Here we report the x-ray structure of P. aeruginosa PAO1 lipase (PAL)1 at 2.54 Å resolution, in the open conformation. The enzyme has been cocrystallized with the substrate analogue 1,2-dioctylcarbamoyl-glycero-3-O-p-nitrophenyl octylphosphonate, which binds covalently to the enzyme. The structure provides a structural description of the enzyme in its activated state and allows a detailed explanation of the regio- and stereoselectivity of the enzyme toward triglyceride substrates. These results can be generalized to other members of the bacterial lipase family I.1. The lipase fromP. aeruginosa was cloned, overexpressed, and purified as described previously (20Jaeger K.-E. Adrain F.-J. Meyer H.E. Hancock R.E.W. Winkler U.K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1120: 315-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Crystallization of the inhibited enzyme was achieved by the sitting drop vapor diffusion method at room temperature. The protein solution, containing 5 mg/ml lipase, 10 mm Tris/HCl (pH 8.0), and 1% β-octylpyranoside, was incubated for 90 h at 12 °C in a 1:10 ratio withR C-(R P,S P)-1,2-dioctylcarbamoyl-glycero-3-O-p-nitrophenyl octylphosphonate (R C-trioctyl) (21Mannesse M.L.M.

After incubation, the lipase-inhibitor complex was equilibrated against a precipitant solution containing 25% 2-methyl-2,4-pentanediol, 20 mm CaCl2 in 100 mm citrate buffer (pH 5.6). Rod-shaped crystals, suitable for x-ray analysis, grew within months. They were highly x-ray-sensitive, and therefore the data collection was performed at cryo temperature (100 K), using the mother liquor as the cryoprotectant. The crystals diffracted up to 2.54 Å resolution using synchrotron radiation. They belong to space groupP212121, with unit cell parameters of a = 45.47 Å, b = 50.96 Å, c = 110.02 Å. This unit cell gives a VM value of 2.2 Å3Da−1 assuming 1 molecule of 29 kDa per asymmetric unit. A native data set was collected with a MAR Research image plate system at beamline BW7B of the EMBL Outstation at DESY, Hamburg. Data were integrated and merged using the DENZO/SCALEPACK package (22Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38453) Google Scholar) and CCP4 software (23Collaborative Computational Project Number 4 Acta Crystallogr. Sect.

The best result was obtained by including in the search model all the side chains. The rotational search clearly indicated a solution at α = 23.2°, β = 30.5°, γ = 348.9°, with a correlation coefficient of 0.185. A translational search performed using data in the 4–8-Å resolution range resulted in a solution atx = 0.130, y = 0.003, z= 0.277, with a correlation coefficient of 0.277 and anR factor of 0.511. After rigid-body refinement of this solution, the final correlation coefficient andR factor were 0.304 and 0.501, respectively (Table I). Despite the poor quality of the initial electron density map, the covalent bond present between the nucleophile (Ser82) and the phosphonate inhibitor was perfectly visible as well as the sn-3 moiety of the triglyceride analogue. This was interpreted as a clear indication of the correctness of the molecular replacement solution. Many cycles of manual rebuilding, using the program O (25Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13006) Google Scholar), and refinement, using the program CNS (26Brünger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L.

The best refinement results were obtained using a flat bulk solvent correction. Water molecules and a calcium ion were placed according to strict density and distance criteria. The final model consists of 285 amino acid residues, one calcium ion, 112 water molecules, and one molecule of R C-trioctyl (with the phosphorus atom in the S P configuration) covalently bound to the catalytic Ser82. All protein residues are visible in the electron density map as well as the sn-3 moiety of the inhibitor. For the sn-1 and sn-2 moieties, only discontinuous density is present, probably due to high mobility of these triglyceride chains, as reflected by their B-factors (55–68 Å2). The crystallographic R factorand R free of the final model are 0.193 and 0.237, respectively. The stereochemical quality of the structure was assessed with the programs PROCHECK (27Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar) and WHATCHECK (28Hooft R.W.W. Vriend G. Sander C. Abola E.E. Nature. 1996; 381: 272Crossref PubMed Scopus (1799) Google Scholar). Only Ser82 is in a disallowed region of the Ramachandran plot (29Ramakrishnan C. Ramachandran G.N. J. Mol. Biol. 1965; 7: 95-99Google Scholar), as expected for the nucleophile of a member of the α/β hydrolase fold family. Val258 is in acis-peptide conformation. The structure was further analyzed using the program DALI (30Holm L. Sander C. Proteins. 1994; 3: 165-173Crossref Scopus (240) Google Scholar). Refinement statistics are given in TableII.

Open table in a new tab P. aeruginosalipase has a nearly globular shape with approximate dimensions of 35 × 40 × 50 Å3. Its structure consists of a “core” domain (residues 1–108 and 164–285), showing the typical features of the α/β hydrolase fold topology (31Ollis D.L. Cheah E. Cygler M. Dijkstra B. Frolow F.

Biol. 1999; 9: 732-737Crossref PubMed Scopus (673) Google Scholar), and a “cap” domain (residues 109–163), with four α-helices (α4, α5, α6, and α8) that shape the active site cleft (Fig.1). Helix α5 and its neighboring loops can be considered as a “lid” in the open conformation, making the active site cavity accessible to solvent and substrate (Fig.1 A). Compared with the canonical α/β hydrolase fold (Fig. 1 B), the first two β-strands are absent, and therefore, to be consistent with the numbering of the consensus α/β hydrolase fold, the first strand in the PAL structure is named β3. The helix corresponding to the canonical helix αE is absent too. Furthermore, an additional small antiparallel β-sheet (β-strands b1 and b2) is inserted between strand β3 and helix α1, and an additional β-strand (β′8) lines up with the sixth strand (β8) of the central β-sheet, but in the opposite direction (Fig.1 B). P. aeruginosa lipase is the first member of family I.1 of bacterial lipases of which a crystal structure has been elucidated. Its structure is similar to the family I.2 lipase structures from B. glumae (BGL) (15Noble M.E.M. Cleasby A. Johnson L.N. Egmond M.R. Frenken L.G.J. FEBS Lett. 1993; 331: 123-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar), B. cepacia (BCL) (16Kim K.K. Song H.K. Shin D.H. Hwang K.Y. Suh S.W.

Lipids. 1998; 93: 115-122Crossref Scopus (24) Google Scholar), andC. viscosum (CVL) (14Lang D. Hofmann B. Haalck L. Hecht H.-J. Spener F. Schmid R.D. Schomburg D. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 259: 704-717Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar), which show 42% amino acid sequence identity to PAL. The structural similarity is mainly localized in the core domain, where the secondary structure elements correspond well (Figs. 2 and3). Nevertheless, major differences occur in the region following strand β7, where in PAL a deletion of more than 20 residues results in the absence of the antiparallel β-sheet formed by strands b3 and b4 (Fig. 3). As a consequence, helix α8 of PAL superimposes on helix α9 of homology family I.2 lipases. Most importantly, helix α10 in homology family I.2 structures (equivalent to helix αE in the canonical α/β hydrolase fold) is absent in PAL (Fig. 1 B), with the corresponding residues 234–237 classified as a “hydrogen-bonded turn” (27Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar, 30Holm L. Sander C. Proteins. 1994; 3: 165-173Crossref Scopus (240) Google Scholar). Residue Cys235 in this turn forms a disulfide bond with Cys183, cross-linking the loops at the N-terminal sides of strands β8 and β′8 (Fig. 1). Although this disulfide bridge is conserved in BCL (Cys190–Cys270) and BGL/CVL (Cys190–Cys269) (Fig. 3), the PAL Cys183 does not superimpose well on the family I.2 Cys190 due to a three-residue deletion just after helix α7 in PAL. This deletion brings the PAL Cys183 Cα atom about 1.5–2.0 Å removed from the position of the Cys190Cα atom in BCL and BGL/CVL. As a consequence, the position of Cys235 has shifted as well. The absence of an α-helical structure for residues 234–237 allows PAL to compensate for the three-residue deletion and to bring Cys235 at the correct distance to Cys183 for disulfide bridge formation. Mutation of both cysteine residues to serines rendered PAL more sensitive to heat denaturation and proteolytic degradation, suggesting a role of the disulfide bond in stabilizing the molecule (13Jaeger K.-E. Dijkstra B.W. Reetz M.T. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1999; 53: 315-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (904) Google Scholar).Figure 3Structure-based sequence alignment of bacterial lipases from homology family I.1 and I.2. The comparison of the amino acid sequences of bacterial lipases from homology family I.1 (P. aeruginosa, V. cholerae, P. fragi, A. calcoaceticus, P. wisconsinensis,P. fluorescens, and P. vulgaris) and from homology family I.2 (B. cepacia, B. glumae,C. viscosum, and P. luteola) has been performed using the program CLUSTALW (36Thompson J.D.

G1 and G2 are 310 helices. The color code of secondary structure elements is in accordance to Fig. 1. The figure has been prepared with ALSCRIPT (37Barton G.J. Protein Eng. 1993; 6: 37-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (1110) Google Scholar).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) It is interesting to notice that PAL Cys183 and Cys235 are highly but not absolutely conserved among the members of bacterial lipase family I.1 (Fig. 3). A disulfide bond interaction similar to PAL is likely to be present in Vibrio cholerae, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, Pseudomonas wisconsinensis, and Pseudomonas luteola lipases. In contrast, thePseudomonas fragi, Phaseolus vulgaris, and Pseudomonas fluorescens lipases lack this interaction. The first two enzymes have only one cysteine residue in their sequence, Cys75 and Cys88, respectively, whereas P. fluorescens has two cysteines, Cys219and Cys233, but none of them matches the positions of the cysteine residues in PAL (Fig. 3). Since the PAL structure is in the open conformation similar to BCL, whereas BGL and CVL are in a closed conformation (Fig. 2), a direct comparison of PAL and BCL can show the structural analogies and differences of the activated form of lipases from bacterial homology families I.1 and I.2. Fig. 2 shows that the three-dimensional similarity of PAL and BCL extends to the cap region. The two open structures superimpose with an root mean square difference of 1.12 Å for 264 structural equivalent Cα atoms out of 285 common Cα atoms. However, the α-helices α4, α5, and α6 of the cap subdomain do not superimpose perfectly in the two enzymes. Helix α5 is one turn longer in PAL than in BCL because of a three-residue insertion in PAL at the C terminus of the helix. The loop connecting α4 and α5 in PAL is three residues shorter than in BCL. Furthermore, helix α4 in PAL is shorter too and ends in a 310 helical conformation (Fig. 3). Differences are also present in the location of helix α6, which in PAL immediately precedes helix α7, so much that helices α6 and α7 can be considered as one single α-helix with a bend of about 90° at the first residue of α7 (Ser164). The catalytic triad residues Ser82 (nucleophile), Asp229 (acid), and His251 are located at their canonical positions in the α/β hydrolase fold (31Ollis D.L. Cheah E. Cygler M. Dijkstra B. Frolow F. Franken S.M. Harel M. Remington S.J. Silman I. Schrag J. Sussman J.L. Verschueren K.H.G. Goldman A. Protein Eng. 1992; 5: 197-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (1835) Google Scholar). Their positions and orientations are similar to the catalytic triad residues in the family I.2 lipases. Ser82 is situated at the very sharp “nucleophile elbow” between strand β5 and helix α3, identified by the consensus sequence Gly-X-Ser-X-Gly (in PAL,X = His at both positions). As in all other α/β hydrolase-fold enzymes of which the three-dimensional structure has been elucidated (33Nardini M. Dijkstra B.W. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1999; 9: 732-737Crossref PubMed Scopus (673) Google Scholar), the nucleophile adopts unfavorable torsion angles (φ = 57°, ψ = −111°) and imposes steric restrictions on the residues located in its proximity. An intricate hydrogen-bonding pattern similar to that found in family I.2 lipases stabilizes the active site residues. The main chain nitrogen atom of Ser82is hydrogen-bonded to the carbonyl oxygen atom of Val105. The Ser82 side chain Oγ atom, covalently bound to the trioctyl inhibitor, is 3.0 Å from the catalytic histidine Nε2 atom, but the geometry is not suitable for a hydrogen bond between these two atoms. Instead, the His251 Nε2 makes a 2.8-Å hydrogen bond to the O1 of the phosphonate inhibitor (Fig.4 B). The His251carbonyl oxygen and amide nitrogen atoms are hydrogen-bonded to the His81 Nε2 atom and Asp229 carbonyl oxygen atom, respectively. Most importantly, the His251 Nδ1 is 3.1 Å from the Oδ2 of the Asp229 side chain that is responsible for stabilizing the positively charged His251side chain during catalysis. The Asp229 Oδ2 atom is not only at hydrogen-bonding distance from the catalytic histidine but is also very close (2.7 Å) to the Glu254 Oε2 atom. The Glu254 Oε1 atom is 3.6 Å away from the His251 Nδ1 atom and, therefore, does not interact directly with the triad histidine. However, it has been suggested forB. glumae lipase (15Noble M.E.M. Cleasby A. Johnson L.N. Egmond M.R. Frenken L.G.J. FEBS Lett. 1993; 331: 123-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar) that an acid residue at that position may assist the catalytic histidine during hydrolysis, either directly or via a water molecule, if the triad acid (Asp/Glu) is mutated. This could also be the case for the P. aeruginosa lipase. Approximately 15 Å from the nucleophile Ser82, at the same side of the enzyme where the catalytic His251 is located, a calcium binding pocket is present. The calcium ion is octahedrally coordinated, and its ligands are the two carboxylate groups of Asp209 and Asp253 (both absolutely conserved in all family I.1 and I.2 lipases), the two carbonyl oxygen atoms of Gln257 and Leu261, and two water molecules (Fig.5). All the distances to calcium are within ∼2.2–2.4 Å, and the low Bfactor values of the ion and its ligands (17–30 Å2) reflect a relatively rigid conformation of the calcium binding region. Despite the medium resolution (2.54 Å) of the PAL crystal structure, Val258is unambiguously in a cis-peptide conformation. Thecis-peptide bond between Gln257 and Val258 is stabilized by a conserved hydrogen-bonding network that extends to the catalytic His251. The Ca2+ ion bridges helix α8, which forms part of the wall of the active site cleft, to the loop containing the catalytic histidine and, therefore, contributes to keep His251 at the correct position in the active site. The binding mode of the Ca2+ ion is conserved in BCL, BGL, and CVL, including the presence of a cis-peptide bond corresponding to Val258 in PAL. Furthermore, a structure-based sequence alignment of the bacterial lipases from families I.1 and I.2 shows the conservation of an Asn/Asp residue at the position preceding the catalytic histidine (Fig. 3). This Asn/Asp residue hydrogen bonds one of the two water molecules that coordinate the calcium ion. The other residues in PAL that interact with these water molecules (Thr205, Ser211, and Asp212) are also highly conserved, with some variation that is not likely to influence the calcium binding. This can be deduced, for instance, from the fact that in the BCL, BGL, and CVL structures an alanine replaces PAL Thr205, with the calcium-coordinating water molecule hydrogen bonded to another solvent molecule located at a position equivalent to the Thr205 Oγ1 atom in PAL. The PAL structure provides a rare example of a lipase complexed with a triglyceride-like inhibitor. The only other example is that of the family I.2 lipase fromB. cepacia. Structural analysis of the open conformation of PAL and BCL in complex with the same R C-trioctyl inhibitor (Fig. 4 A) (21Mannesse M.L.M. Boots J.W.P. Dijkman R. Slotboom A.J. Vanderhijden H.T.W.V. Egmond M.R. Verheij H.M. de Haas G.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1259: 56-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) offers the opportunity of a direct comparison of the binding mode of the substrate analogue in lipases from families I.1 and I.2. In both PAL- and BCL-inhibited structures theR C-trioctyl molecule is covalently linked at its phosphorus atom to the nucleophilic Oγ atom of the catalytic serine residue and perfectly fits into similar hydrophobic active site clefts. In PAL this cleft is 15 Å deep and has an ovoid shape with approximate dimensions of 10 × 25 Å. It is bordered by helices α4, α5, α8 and by the loops of residues 16 to 29 and 255 to 259. Its walls are lined mostly with hydrophobic side chains, making it perfectly suited for lipid binding. At the base of the cleft the Met16 side chain divides it in two parts, thus giving a characteristic boomerang-like shape to the active site, with four binding pockets, an oxyanion hole and three pockets for the different branches of the triacylglycerol substrate (Fig. 4 B). In PAL the Met16 and His83 main chain amide groups are 2.8 Å and 2.9 Å from one of the phosphorous oxygen atoms (O4) (Fig. 4 B). A similar interaction is present in BCL involving Leu17 and Gln88 residues. Since the R C-trioctyl-complexed structure represents the putative tetrahedral intermediate conformation during the acylation step of the reaction, the Met16 and His83backbone nitrogen atoms localize the oxyanion binding pocket in a position very well conserved within the α/β hydrolase-fold enzymes (31Ollis D.L.

Met16 is the second residue of the tetrapeptide motif Gly-Hyd-X-Gly (Hyd = Met, Leu, Val) located between strand β3 and helix α4 and highly conserved in families I.1 and I.2 of bacterial lipases (Fig. 3). In PAL this tetrapeptide motif is stabilized by a hydrogen bond between the His14 carbonyl oxygen atom and the Arg56NH2 atom. Arg56 is a totally buried residue that lies at the beginning of helix α2, close to the nucleophile elbow. It connects the oxyanion hole tetrapeptide motif to the loop between strand β3 and helix α2 via the hydrogen bond Arg56 NH1-Ser48 O. Interestingly, Arg56 is totally conserved in homology family I.1 as well as in homology family I.2 lipases (Fig. 3). In the open conformation of BCL the interaction pattern of this Arg (Arg61) strongly resembles that of PAL Arg56, with the Arg61side chain hydrogen-bonded to the carbonyl oxygen atom of His15 and Ser50. In contrast, in the closed conformations of CVL and BGL, the Arg61 side chain is hydrogen-bonded to the carbonyl oxygen atoms of Leu17 and Gly51 and of Gly16 and Phe52, respectively. Since the movements of the loop between strand β4 and helix α2 (PAL residues 45–52), of the oxyanion loop (PAL residues 14–20), and of the lid region are correlated (17Schrag J.D. Li Y. Cygler M. Lang D. Burgdorf T. Hecht H.-J. Schmid R. Schomburg D. Rydel T.J. Oliver J.D. Strickland L.C. Dunaway C.M. Larson S.B. Day J. McPherson A. Structure ( Lond. ). 1997; 5: 187-202Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar), the variation of the hydrogen-bonding pattern of this conserved Arg residue might play an important stabilizing role during the opening of the lid of these lipases. In PAL the sn-3 octyl chain of the inhibitor (atoms C4-C11) is accommodated in a large groove (about 8.5 Å × 9.0 Å) formed by the side chains of Met16, Pro108, Ser112, Thr114, Ala115, Leu118, Leu131, Val135, Leu159, Leu162, Leu231, and Val232 (acyl chain pocket HA). The octyl group of the inhibitor fits snugly in this cleft and is bound via van der Waals interactions. Because of its size, the acyl binding pocket may easily accommodate up to about 12 fatty acid carbon atoms. The binding of thesn-3 moiety in the acyl-binding pocket (HA) is almost identical in PAL and BCL. The alcohol binding pocket is separated from the acyl pocket by the side chain of Met16 and contains the bound lipid analogue in a bent “tuning fork” conformation (Fig. 4 B). Thesn-2 moiety (atoms N2-C30) fits in a hydrophobic pocket lined by Leu17, Phe19, Ile22, Val25, Tyr27, Leu252, Val255, Gln257, Val258, and Phe259 (HH pocket). The latter residues are part of the calcium binding loop (residues 252 to 261). The HH pocket is slightly larger in PAL compared with that of BCL, and consequently, the enzyme-inhibitor interactions are less tight than in BCL. There is space for about 8–10 fatty acid carbon atoms to be accommodated in this pocket. Longer chains would partly stick into the solvent or micelle. In the HH pocket all the enzyme-inhibitor interactions are hydrophobic, and the NH group of the carbamoyl function of this chain does not have any specific hydrogen-bonding interactions with the protein. In particular, the hydrogen bond which in BCL connects the Thr18 Oγ atom to the carbonyl oxygen of the carbamoyl function of the sn-2 chain is absent in PAL due to the presence of a hydrophobic residue, Leu17, instead of the polar Thr18 in BCL. The sn-1 inhibitor moiety (atoms N1-C20) interacts less tightly with the enzyme than the sn-2 chain. It is located in a pocket more exposed to the solvent (HB pocket). The only specific interactions with the protein are van der Waals contacts with the side chains of Leu17, Leu138, and Phe214. The location of the sn-1 chain is mainly determined by a hydrophobic clamp formed by Phe214 and Leu138. The sn-1 chain diverges considerably with respect to the position found in the BCL complex since in the latter lipase the bulky side chain of Phe214 is substituted for an Ala247 (Fig. 3). As for the sn-2 moiety, the sn-1 NH group of the carbamoyl function does not specifically interact with the protein. Pro210 and Ser211 are located between the two sn-1 andsn-2 moieties but too far away to make any direct interaction. Since the HH pocket hosting the sn-2 chain provides a more intimate interaction with the substrate analogue than the HB pocket occupied by the sn-1 chain, the HH pocket is most likely the one that determines the regio-preference of the enzyme toward the primary position of triglyceride substrates together with the size of the acyl chain pocket HA. In view of the differences in the inhibitor binding modes in the alcohol binding pocket, it is not surprising that PAL and BCL differ somewhat in their stereospecificity. BCL prefers theR C-trioctyl inhibitor over theS C-trioctyl compound by a factor of 7. It has been suggested that Leu287 and Ile290 play an important role in conferring this preference by providing unfavorable interactions with the carbonyl oxygen (O7) of theS C-trioctyl compound (18Lang D.A. Mannesse M.L.M. De Haas G.H. Verheij H.M. Dijkstra B.W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 254: 333-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the hydrophilic interaction of the sn-2 carbonyl oxygen (O6) with the Oγ1 atom of Thr18 favors this preference (18Lang D.A. Mannesse M.L.M. De Haas G.H. Verheij H.M. Dijkstra B.W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 254: 333-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). In contrast, in PAL the residue corresponding to BCL Ile290 is Val255, a less bulky residue, and BCL Thr18 corresponds to Leu17 in PAL, a non-polar residue (Fig. 3). These differences explain why PAL prefers theR C-trioctyl inhibitor only by a factor of 1.5 over the S C-trioctyl compound. 2K. Liebeton and K.-E. Jaeger, manuscript in preparation. The x-ray structure of P. aeruginosalipase provides the first three-dimensional structure of a member of homology family I.1 of bacterial lipases. The molecule is in the open conformation and the active site contains a triacylglycerol analogue covalently bound to the catalytic nucleophile, Ser82. The other catalytic residues are Asp229 and His251. An octahedrally coordinated calcium ion stabilizes the loop containing the catalytic histidine. Sequence alignment with other lipases of homology family I.1 shows that the residues important for catalysis and fold stabilization are conserved."

In the superconducting state, the photoemission peak intensity as a function of doping scales with the superfluid density and the condensation energy. As a function of temperature, the peak intensity shows an abrupt behavior near the superconducting phase transition temperature where phase coherence sets in, rather than near the temperature where the gap opens. This anomalous manifestation of collective effects in single-particle spectroscopy raises important questions concerning the mechanism of high-temperature superconductivity."

By using human airway epithelial cells, we show that CFTR associates with Na+/H+exchanger (NHE) type 3kinase Aregulatory protein (E3KARP), an EBP50/NHE regulatory factor (NHERF)-related PDZ domain protein. The PDZ binding motif located at the COOH terminus of CFTR interacts preferentially with the second PDZ domain of E3KARP, with nanomolar affinity. In contrast to EBP50/NHERF, E3KARP is predominantly localized (>95%) in the membrane fractions of Calu-3 and T84 cells, where CFTR is located. Moreover, confocal immunofluorescence microscopy of polarized Calu-3 monolayers shows that E3KARP and CFTR are co-localized at the apical membrane domain. We also found that ezrin associates with E3KARP in vivo. Co-expression of CFTR with E3KARP and ezrin in Xenopus oocytes potentiated cAMP-stimulated CFTR Cl− currents. These results support the concept that E3KARP functions as a scaffold protein that links CFTR to ezrin. Since ezrin has been shown previously to function as a protein kinase A anchoring protein, we suggest that one function served by the interaction of E3KARP with both ezrin and CFTR is to localize protein kinase A in the vicinity of the R-domain of CFTR.

Welsh M.J. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: S23-S45Crossref PubMed Scopus (811) Google Scholar). Mutations of CFTR cause cystic fibrosis, one of the most common fatal genetic diseases (2Pilewski J.M. Frizzell R.A. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: S215-S255Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). To date, more than 800 mutations of the CFTR gene have been identified in patients with cystic fibrosis (CFTR data base, available on the World Wide Web). The primary step in CFTR channel activation involves protein kinase A (PKA)-mediated phosphorylation of the regulatory (R) domain, which contains nine dibasic PKA consensus phosphorylation sites. Phosphorylation at multiple R-domain sites is thought to release its block of the CFTR conductance pathway and to facilitate interactions between the nucleotide-binding domains, where sequential binding and hydrolysis of ATP elicit channel opening and closing (gating) activity (3Gadsby D.C. Nairn A.C. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: S77-S107Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). Regulation of the CFTR Cl− channel via protein-protein interactions has been the subject of several recent studies. For example, the NH2 terminus of CFTR has been shown to bind syntaxin 1A, which inhibits cAMP-stimulated Cl− currents by reducing the number of open CFTR Cl− channels present in the plasma membrane (4Naren A.P. Nelson D.J. Xie W. Jovov B. Pevsner J. Bennett M.K. Benos D.J. Quick M.W. Kirk K.L. Nature. 1997; 390: 302-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar, 5Peters K.W. Qi J. Watkins S.C. Frizzell R.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: C174-C180Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, a tyrosine-based motif in the COOH terminus mediates association of CFTR with the AP-2 adapter complex, which governs the preferential endocytosis of CFTR into clathrin-coated membrane vesicles (6Prince L.S. Peter K. Hatton S.R. Zaliauskiene L. Cotlin L.F. Clancy J.P. Marchase R.B. Collawn J.F. J. Biol.

Finally, the COOH terminus of CFTR corresponds to a PDZ-binding motif (TRL), which has been proposed to mediate an interaction of CFTR with EBP50 (ezrin-binding phosphoprotein 50), also known as NHERF (Na+/H+exchanger type 3 regulatory factor) (8Short D.B. Trotter K.W. Reczek D. Kreda S.M. Bretscher A. Boucher R.C. Stutts M.J. Milgram S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19797-19801Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar, 9Wang S.

Lefkowitz R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 8496-8501Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). Through its PDZ domains, NHERF has been shown to interact with several membrane receptors and ion channels/transporters (10Hall R.A. Ostedgaard L.S. Premont R.T. Blitzer J.T. Rahman N. Welsh M.J. Lefkowitz R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 8496-8501Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). For example, NHERF confers cAMP/PKA-mediated inhibition of Na+/H+ exchange activity in renal cells (11Weinman E.J. Steplock D. Tate K. Hall R.A. Spurney R.F. Shenolikar S. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 2199-2206Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), and its human homologue, EBP50, has been shown to bind to members of the ERM (ezrin-radixin-moesin) family of proteins (12Reczek D. Bretscher A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18452-18458Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). The interaction of EBP50/NHERF with ezrin, which contains a binding site for the regulatory type II (RII) subunit of PKA, may permit ezrin to function as a protein kinase A anchoring protein, or AKAP (13Dransfield D.T. Bradford A.J. Smith J. Martin M. Roy C. Mangeat P.H. Goldenring J.R. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 35-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar, 14Sun F. Hug M.J. Bradbury N.A. Frizzell R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14360-14366Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Because PDZ domain proteins generally mediate associations of target proteins with various regulatory factors, CFTR-PDZ domain interactions could have important consequences for the regulation of CFTR Cl− channel activity and perhaps for other CFTR functions (15Mohler P.J. Kreda S.M. Boucher R.C. Sudol M. Stutts M.J. Milgram S.L. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 879-890Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). We demonstrated recently (14Sun F. Hug M.J. Bradbury N.A. Frizzell R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14360-14366Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar) that immunoprecipitates (IPs) of CFTR contain the PKA regulatory and catalytic subunits and that both CFTR and model PKA substrate peptides could be phosphorylated in the CFTR IP by addition of cAMP and ATP. Ezrin was also present in CFTR IPs, and it was expressed at high levels in Cl−-secreting epithelia that express CFTR. Ezrin bound the PKA RII subunit in protein overlay and co-IP assays, indicative of AKAP activity. Finally, conditions that disrupt the ezrin-RII association markedly attenuated stimulation of CFTR Cl− currents by cAMP. These findings suggest that PKA anchoring is physiologically important for CFTR activation, and, based on the above observations, a CFTR·EBP50/NHERF·ezrin complex could selectively regulate CFTR by sequestering PKA in proximity to the R-domain. Na+/H+exchanger type 3kinase Aregulatoryprotein (E3KARP) has been cloned recently from a human lung cDNA library (16Yun C.H. Oh S. Zizak M. Steplock D. Tsao S. Tse C.M. Weinman E.J. Donowitz M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3010-3015Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar). E3KARP contains two PDZ domains, and it shares ∼52% amino acid identity with EBP50/NHERF (17Yun C.H. Lamprecht G. Forster D.V. Sidor A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25856-25863Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). cAMP-dependent inhibition of NHE3 requires co-expression of either E3KARP or NHERF in renal cell lines (17Yun C.H. Lamprecht G. Forster D.V. Sidor A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25856-25863Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). Since this arrangement is analogous to the manner in which CFTR is regulated by cAMP/PKA, we examined the potential for E3KARP to provide a physical link between ezrin and CFTR. We report that the PDZ-binding motif at the COOH terminus of CFTR associates with E3KARP at high affinity. In turn, the interaction of E3KARP with ezrin assembles a regulatory complex at the apical membranes of human airway cells that brings CFTR into interactions with PKA and the cytoskeleton. Calu-3 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's/Ham's F-12 media (Sigma) supplemented with 15% fetal bovine serum. Cells were maintained in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2 at 37 °C. T84 cells were cultured under similar conditions, except that the medium was supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. For confocal microscopy, Calu-3 cells were seeded onto Costar Transwell cell culture inserts coated with fibronectin and vitrogen. The apical medium bathing Calu-3 cells was removed after several days in culture, and the cells were maintained at an air interface until use. Confocal microscopy (see below) was performed after 14–21 days in culture. Generation of polyclonal E3KARP and NHERF antibodies was described previously (17Yun C.H. Lamprecht G. Forster D.V. Sidor A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25856-25863Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). Monoclonal CFTR antibodies were from R & D Systems. Monoclonal GST and ezrin antibodies were obtained from Sigma. Antibody dilutions are given below. Full-length CFTR, E3KARP, and ezrin cDNAs were cloned into pCDNA3 (Invitrogen). cRNAs were synthesized using the mESSAGE mACHINE kit (Ambion) from linearized plasmids. The synthesized cRNAs were quantified by spectrophotometry and denatured agarose gel electrophoresis. Fractionation of Calu-3 cells was performed as described previously (14Sun F. Hug M.J. Bradbury N.A. Frizzell R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14360-14366Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Briefly, confluent Calu-3 and T84 cells, pretreated with or without 10 μm forskolin for 15 min under the culture conditions, were scraped into buffer (10 mm Tris·HCl (pH 7.4), 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, with protease inhibitors (Roche Molecular Biochemicals)) and homogenized. Postnuclear supernatants were obtained by centrifugation (14,000 × g for 1 min). Cytosolic and membrane fractions were obtained by centrifugation of the postnuclear supernatants at 100,000 × g for 60 min. Cytosolic proteins were prepared by concentrating the supernatants in lysis buffer (50 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 150 mmNaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol). The membrane fraction was obtained by resuspension of the pellet in lysis buffer. Various domains of E3KARP and CFTR were amplified by polymerase chain reaction, as shown in Fig. 1. An EcoRI site at the NH2 terminus and an XhoI site at the COOH terminus were generated for CFTR-NT, CFTR-CT, E3KARP-PDZ1, and -PDZ2 constructs. An EcoRI site at the NH2terminus and a SalI site at the COOH terminus were created for the full-length E3KARP and E3KARP-CT plasmids. CFTR-RD was generated by insertion of a SmaI site at the NH2terminus and an XhoI site at the COOH end. The COOH terminus deletion constructs, CFTR-CTd4 and CFTR-CTd23, were generated using the ExSite Polymerase Chain Reaction-based Site-Directed Mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) from the CFTR-CT construct. All constructs were inserted into pGEX-4T-1 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) at proper sites, except for full-length E3KARP, which was inserted into pGEX-6P-1 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) at the EcoRI and SalI sites. Fidelity of these plasmid constructs was confirmed by DNA sequencing. Glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion proteins were expressed in the Escherichia coli strain BL21 (DE3, Novagen). Optimal expression of fusion proteins was achieved by adding a final concentration of 1 mmisopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside to the bacterial culture, with incubation for 4 h at 37 °C. The bacteria were harvested by centrifugation and resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline with protease inhibitors. After sonication, GST fusion proteins or GST were purified using glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Pre-cleared Calu-3 cell lysates (∼1 mg of protein) or membrane fractions (∼200 μg of protein) were mixed with the appropriate primary antibodies for 1.5 h at 4 °C in lysis buffer. Twenty five μl of washed protein A- or G-Sepharose beads were added to each sample and incubated 1 h at 4 °C with gentle rotation. Immunocomplexes with protein A- or G-Sepharose beads were washed with lysis buffer four times and precipitated by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 10 s. The immunocomplexes were resuspended in SDS sample buffer and subjected to immunoblotting. Equal amounts of protein from the membrane and cytosolic fractions were prepared from either forskolin-treated or non-treated Calu-3 and T84 cells. These samples, or the immunoprecipitates described above, were resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred to PVDF membranes. Unbound sites were blocked for 1 h at room temperature with 5% (w/v) skim milk powder in TBST (10 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 150 mm NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20). The blots were incubated with primary antibodies (anti-E3KARP, 1:8000; anti-NHERF, 1:5000; and anti-CFTR-C, 1:1000) at room temperature for 1 h. The blots were then washed four times for 5 min each with TBST and incubated for 1 h with 2 μg/ml horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Sigma) in TBST with 10% fetal bovine serum, followed by five TBST washes. The reactive bands were visualized by Renaissance Chemiluminescence (NEN Life Science Products). Samples were exposed to x-ray film (Eastman Kodak Co.). Confluent Calu-3 cells were lysed in lysis buffer and centrifuged at 12,000 × g at 4 °C for 1 min. The supernatant was incubated with 10 μg of recombinant GST fusion protein beads in lysis buffer at 4 °C for 1.5 h with gentle rotation. Bound proteins were washed five times with lysis buffer and resuspended in SDS sample buffer. The samples were resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and were immunoblotted with appropriate antibodies (anti-E3KARP, anti-CFTR-C, and anti-ezrin, 1:2000; other dilutions as above). Ten μg each of GST-CFTR-NT, GST-CFTR-RD, GST-CFTR-CT, and GST were resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, transferred to PVDF membrane, and blocked with blocking buffer (5% nonfat milk, 10 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 150 mm NaCl) containing 1% BSA at room temperature for 3 h. The membrane was then overlaid with [35S]methionine-labeled full-length E3KARP (generated using the TNT in vitro transcription-translation system (Promega)) in blocking buffer containing 0.1% BSA for 4 h. The membrane was washed three times in TBST, and the label was visualized by autoradiography. For in vitro competition assays, the blot containing 10 μg of GST-CFTR-CT fusion protein was overlaid with [35S]methionine-labeled E3KARP in the presence of different concentrations of E3KARP peptide (generated by digesting GST-E3KAP with PreScission protease (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech)). The blot was then washed three times in TBST, and the signal was visualized by autoradiography. Quantitation of the individual bands was achieved using a Bio-Rad PhosphorImage analysis system. Immunofluorescence staining of filter grown Calu-3 cells was performed as described previously (14Sun F. Hug M.J. Bradbury N.A. Frizzell R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14360-14366Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Briefly, Calu-3 cells were fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde and permeabilized with a mixture of 2% paraformaldehyde and 0.1% Triton X-100. The cells were then washed three times with buffer A (0.5% BSA and 0.15% glycine at pH 7.4 in phosphate-buffered saline). After blocking with purified goat serum, the monolayers were incubated in the appropriate primary antibodies (anti-ezrin, anti-E3KARP, and anti-CFTR, dilutions as above) for 1 h followed by three washes in buffer A and subsequent incubation with fluorescein isothiocyanate (green) or rhodamine (red)-labeled secondary antibodies (Molecular Probes) for another hour. After washing with buffer A, the filters were mounted on glass coverslips using synthetic resin and subjected to confocal microscopy. Collected images were exported to ImageSpace (Molecular Dynamics) for subsequent reconstruction and processing. The ND-96 solution utilized for the current measurements contained 96 mm NaCl, l mmKCl, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 1.0 mmMgCl2, and 5 mm HEPES. Xenopusoocytes expressing CFTR (1 ng) and the β2-adrenergic receptor (1 ng) or these cRNAs plus E3KARP (5 ng) and ezrin (5 ng) were used to record CFTR-dependent Cl− currents (ICl) as described previously (5Peters K.W. Qi J. Watkins S.C. Frizzell R.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: C174-C180Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were impaled with two 3 m KCl-filled electrodes connected to a GeneClamp 500 amplifier (Axon Instruments) via Ag-AgCl pellet electrodes and referenced to the bath by Ag-AgCl pellets. Oocytes were held at −30 mV, and membrane currents were recorded during repetitive pulses to −60 mV for 500-ms duration; these inward currents reflect outward Cl− flow through CFTR during stimulation by 10 μm isoproterenol to raise intracellular cAMP. Values of ICl were obtained at 2-s intervals; steady-state values are given in Fig. 9. We performed co-immunoprecipitation experiments to determine whether CFTR interacts with E3KARP in intact cells. In these experiments, Calu-3 cell lysates were mixed with monoclonal antibodies against the CFTR regulatory domain (anti-CFTR-RD) or the COOH terminus (anti-CFTR-C). After SDS-PAGE, the immunoprecipitates were probed with a polyclonal E3KARP antibody (18Lamprecht G. Weinman E.J. Yun C.-H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29972-29978Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig.2 A, the immunoprecipitate obtained using anti-CFTR-RD contained E3KARP, the band detected at 50-kDa molecular mass. This result indicates that E3KARP interacts with CFTR in airway cells in vivo. Interestingly, when a similar immunoprecipitation was performed using anti-CFTR-C, we were unable to detect E3KARP in the precipitate. This result suggests that the region mediating the CFTR-E3KARP interaction might be located at the COOH terminus of CFTR (see below). To evaluate further the CFTR-E3KARP interaction, the reciprocal immunoprecipitation was performed, in which an E3KARP antibody was mixed with the membrane fraction from Calu-3 cells. The immunocomplexes were precipitated with protein A-agarose beads. After SDS-PAGE and transfer to PVDF membrane, protein was blotted with anti-CFTR-C (denaturing conditions). As shown in Fig. 2 B, E3KARP co-immunoprecipitated CFTR, whereas a control IgG did not. This further demonstrates that an interaction between E3KARP and CFTR occursin vivo. Next, we addressed two questions regarding this protein-protein interaction. (i) Does CFTR interact directly with E3KARP or is this interaction mediated by another protein? (ii) Where is the E3KARP-binding site on CFTR? To approach the first question, we used in vitro protein overlay assays. We generated three CFTR cytoplasmic domains as follows: the NH2 terminus (NT), the regulatory domain (RD), and the COOH terminus (CT). These three CFTR cytoplasmic domains were expressed as GST fusion proteins in bacteria (GST-NT, -RD, and -CT). In these assays, 10 μg each of GST-CFTR fusion protein was resolved by SDS-PAGE, transferred to PVDF membrane, and probed with [35S]methionine-labeled E3KARP generated by in vitro transcription-translation. The results shown in Fig.3 A reveal that E3KARP interacts with the COOH terminus of CFTR. No interaction of E3KARP with CFTR-NT or CFTR-RD or with GST alone was detected. Because components other than labeled E3KARP were not present in the overlay assay, we conclude that the interaction between CFTR and E3KARP is direct. To evaluate this interaction in epithelial cells, we performed pull-down assays in which GST and GST fusion proteins (-NT, -RD, and -CT) were bound to glutathione beads, mixed with Calu-3 cell lysates, and precipitated by centrifugation. The precipitates were resolved by SDS-PAGE and probed with an E3KARP antibody. When GST-CT protein beads were incubated with Calu-3 cell lysates, E3KARP was detected in the precipitate (Fig. 3 B). In contrast, when beads containing GST-NT, GST-RD, or GST alone were mixed with these lysates, E3KARP was not found in the precipitates. These results confirm that the interaction between CFTR and E3KARP occurs at the COOH terminus of CFTR and that it occurs in airway epithelial cells. In view of the above finding, we attempted to further resolve the E3KARP-binding site by deleting the COOH terminus of CFTR. Two different COOH terminus deletion mutants were made and expressed as GST fusion proteins in bacteria as follows: deletion of last 4 CFTR residues (GST-CTd4) and deletion of last 23 residues (GST-CTd23). By using these deletion mutants along with the complete GST-CT, we performed pull-down assays with Calu-3 cell lysates. As shown in Fig.3 C, the GST-CT precipitates E3KARP. However, deletion of the last 4 residues at the COOH terminus of CFTR was sufficient to abolish this interaction. These results are also consistent with the immunoprecipitation results of Fig. 2 A, which show that E3KARP was co-precipitated by anti-CFTR-RD but not by anti-CFTR-CT. The epitope recognized by anti-CFTR-CT resides in the last 4 residues at the COOH terminus of CFTR; therefore, protein interactions at this site would be expected to mask antibody binding. Taken together, these results further demonstrate that E3KARP interacts with CFTR in human airway epithelial cells and that this interaction is mediated by the last 4 amino acid residues at the COOH terminus of CFTR. The last 4 amino acid residues at the COOH terminus of CFTR have been proposed as a PDZ-binding motif, and a physical interaction of this site with the PDZ domain protein EBP50/NHERF has been demonstrated previously in vitro (8Short D.B. Trotter K.W. Reczek D. Kreda S.M. Bretscher A. Boucher R.C. Stutts M.J. Milgram S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19797-19801Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar, 9Wang S.

Lefkowitz R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 8496-8501Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). E3KARP and NHERF share 52% amino acid identity, which is even more significant in the PDZ1 (73%) and PDZ2 (69%) domains (18Lamprecht G. Weinman E.J. Yun C.-H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29972-29978Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). In addition, the PDZ domains of EBP50/NHERF show selectivity for CFTR binding; PDZ1 of EBP50 was found to bind with a greater affinity to the COOH terminus of CFTR than PDZ2 using surface plasmon resonance spectroscopy (8Short D.B. Trotter K.W. Reczek D. Kreda S.M. Bretscher A. Boucher R.C. Stutts M.J. Milgram S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19797-19801Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar). E3KARP also contains two PDZ domains (16Yun C.H. Oh S. Zizak M. Steplock D. Tsao S. Tse C.M. Weinman E.J. Donowitz M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3010-3015Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar, 17Yun C.H. Lamprecht G. Forster D.V. Sidor A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25856-25863Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). By using GST fusion proteins containing these domains of E3KARP (Fig. 1), we found that both PDZ1 and PDZ2 can interact with CFTR. When GST-PDZ fusion proteins were incubated with Calu-3 cell lysates, both PDZ domains precipitated CFTR (Fig.4 A). However, the amount of CFTR that could be precipitated by PDZ2 was three times that precipitated by PDZ1 (Fig. 4 B). When the COOH terminus of E3KARP or GST alone was incubated with Calu-3 cell lysates, CFTR was not detected in the precipitate. These results indicate E3KARP interacts with CFTR via its PDZ domains and that the second PDZ domain of E3KARP interacts preferentially with the CFTR COOH terminus. To examine the relative affinity of the binding of E3KARP to CFTR, we performed competition assays. In these experiments, the GST-CFTR-CT fusion protein was resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred to PVDF membrane. The membrane was then probed with [35S]methionine-labeled E3KARP generated by in vitro transcription-translation. In pilot experiments, we used different amounts of the in vitro labeled E3KARP translation product to determine the amount of labeled protein needed to saturate CFTR-CT binding (see legend, Fig. 5). To evaluate the affinity of E3KARP binding under these conditions, we generated full-length unlabeled E3KARP by digestion of the GST-E3KARP fusion protein. Seven different concentrations of purified E3KARP were then co-incubated with 35S-E3KARP in the GST-CFTR-CT overlay assays. As shown in Fig. 5, upper panel, incubation with 10 μm unlabeled E3KARP protein in the overlay assay completely abolished the binding of E3KARP to the CFTR-CT. Decreasing concentrations of unlabeled E3KARP in the overlay assay led to graded increases in the binding of 35S-E3KARP to the CFTR-CT. The half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) was 72 nm (Fig. 5, lower panel) when the data were fit with a single binding site algorithm (SigmaPlot). This suggests a high affinity interaction between E3KARP and CFTR, which is comparable to the affinity with which PDZ1 of EBP50/NHERF binds to CFTR (8Short D.B. Trotter K.W. Reczek D. Kreda S.M.

We investigated the endogenous distribution of E3KARP and EBP50/NHERF in Calu-3 and T84 cells between soluble and membrane-associated compartments. As shown in Fig.6, E3KARP is predominantly expressed (>95%) in the membrane fraction of both Calu-3 and T84 cells. In contrast, EBP50/NHERF is about equally distributed between these compartments. It has been demonstrated that NHERF is phosphorylated in intact cells under stimulated and non-stimulated conditions (17Yun C.H. Lamprecht G. Forster D.V. Sidor A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25856-25863Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). To determine whether stimulation by cAMP/PKA would alter the distribution of E3KARP and EBP50/NHERF between membranes and cytosol, we treated Calu-3 and T84 cells with forskolin (10 μm) for 15 min prior to cell fractionation. The E3KARP and EBP50/NHERF expression patterns were not affected by forskolin pretreatment. The protein doublet detected by the NHERF antibody reflects phosphorylation of the protein, as reported previously (18Lamprecht G. Weinman E.J. Yun C.-H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29972-29978Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). However, this phosphorylation pattern was not affected by forskolin pretreatment. In Calu-3 and T84 cells, EBP50/NHERF is expressed as a phosphoprotein in both basal and stimulated conditions, but phosphorylated EBP50/NHERF (shown by the slower migrating band in Fig. 6) is mainly present in the cytosolic fraction. It was difficult to detect phosphorylated EBP50/NHERF in the membrane"

Consequently NASP may be important not only for both the storage and transport of histones but also for the assembly of chromatin. Here, we report a somatic form of NASP (sNASP) present in almost all tissues examined, including mouse embryonic cells and several mouse and human tissue culture cell lines. Interestingly, an analysis of the histones complexed with NASP in vivo revealed that in mouse myeloma 66-2 cells only H1, linker histones, could be detected. Somatic NASP is a shorter version of the testicular form of NASP (tNASP) with two deletions in the coding region arising from alternative splicing and differing from tNASP in its 5′ untranslated regions. In both embryonic and transformed cell lines in culture, we found that both sNASP and tNASP are expressed. Unlike spermatogenesis in the testis, in which DNA replication and histone synthesis are uncoupled, in somatic cells histone synthesis and histone mRNA levels are closely coupled to DNA replication (27Borun T.

Having found that NASP is present in somatic cells, we therefore also examined the relationship between NASP mRNA expression and the cell cycle and report that sNASP mRNA levels increase during S-phase and decline during G2, concomitant with histone mRNA levels. All reagents and chemicals used in this study were of molecular biology grade. Alkaline phosphatase, peroxidase, and fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled goat anti-rabbit (heavy and light chain) antisera were purchased from Organon Technica, Inc. (West Chester, PA). DNA probes were labeled with either a North2South biotin-DNA labeling kit (Pierce) or [32P-rsqb]dCTP (ICN Biomedicals Inc., Costa Mesa, CA) with Ready To Go DNA labeling beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). All oligonucleotides were synthesized at the University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill (UNC-CH) Nucleic Acids Core Facility. Restriction and modifying enzymes were purchased from New England Biolabs, Inc. (Beverly, MA). Purifications of plasmid DNA and PCR products were carried out using QIAprep Miniprep and QIAquick PCR purification kits, respectively (Qiagen Inc., Valencia, CA). The mouse testis cDNA library was described previously (30Kong M. Richardson R.T. Widgren E.E. O'Rand M.G. Biol. Reprod. 1995; 53: 579-590Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), and the mouse ovary cDNA library was a gift from Dr. Jurrien Dean (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD). Screening by colony hybridization was performed with 32P-labeled probes using Express-Hyb Solution (CLONTECH, Inc., Palo Alto, CA) according to the recommended protocol. Both strands of positive clones were sequenced by the UNC-CH automated sequencing facility on a model 377 DNA sequencer using the ABI Prism rhodamine terminator cycle sequencing kit (Applied Biosystems Inc., Foster City, CA). The sequence for mouse tNASP (Fig. 1) was obtained by screening a mouse testis cDNA library with a rabbit tNASP probe (2Welch J.E. Zimmerman L. Joseph D. O'Rand M.G. Biol.

Northern blots (Fig. 2, a multiple tissue Northern blot; Fig. 3, an RNA master blot (CLONTECH)) were probed with32P-labeled full-length tNASP, generated by PCR primers specific to the coding region of tNASP (nt 92–2414), and hybridized using Express-Hyb Solution according to theCLONTECH protocol. Blots were exposed for 16 h on a phosphorImager screen, scanned using a Molecular Dynamics Storm 860 PhosphorImager (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and analyzed and quantitated using either ImageQuant software (ImageQuant, Inc., Sunnyvale, CA) or GelExpert software (Nucleotech, Inc., San Mateo, CA). Northern blots of HeLa cell and mouse 3T3 fibroblast RNA were prepared from 1.2% agarose gels loaded with 5 μg/well total RNA and electrophoresed as described for low percentage formaldehyde gels in the Qiagen RNeasy Mini Kit handbook. After electrophoresis, the gels were capillary-transferred to Hybond-N (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech).Figure 3Dot blot analysis of NASP expression.

Thymus and ovary cDNAs were prepared as follows. RNA was isolated from the tissue according to the manufacturer's instructions using the RNeasy Mini Kit for Total RNA (Qiagen) and cDNA was prepared from an oligo(dT) primer using a SuperScript preamplication system for first-strand cDNA synthesis (Life Technologies, Inc.). PCRs were performed using Ready To Go PCR beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Cycle conditions were set up as described previously (23Dilworth S.M. Black S.J. Laskey R.A. Cell. 1987; 51: 1009-1018Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar) using the following primers: for amplification of the full-length NASP coding region, the sense primer was 5′-ATGGCCACAGATTCTACAGCC-3′ and the antisense primer was 5′-TTAACATGCAGTGCTTTT-3′; for amplification of a fragment specific for tNASP, the sense primer was 5′-AATGAGTGTGGGGAAGCC-3′ and the antisense primer was 5′-TTCACTCTCAGAGGTAGC-3′. Rabbits were immunized with purified recombinant proteins as described (31Richardson R.T. Yamasaki N. O'Rand M.G. Dev. Biol. 1994; 165: 688-701Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Expression constructs were produced using PCR, cloned into pQE-30, transformed to bacterial host M15 (pREP-4) for expression, and purified on Ni-NTA resin as described (31Richardson R.T. Yamasaki N. O'Rand M.G. Dev. Biol. 1994; 165: 688-701Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). N-terminal (nucleotides 96–1099) and C-terminal (nucleotides 1100–2414) constructs from the sequence of mouse tNASP (GenBankTM accession numberAF034610) were used for recombinant protein production. Affinity-purified antibodies were prepared as described (31Richardson R.T. Yamasaki N. O'Rand M.G. Dev.

Proteins were separated on 10–20% gradient minigels (Bio-Rad) and transblotted to Immobilon-P (Waters Inc., Bedford, MA), either stained for protein or blocked, and probed with anti-NASP antiserum as described (32Richardson R.T. Nikolajczyk B.S. Abdullah L.H. Beavers J.C. O'Rand M.G. Biol. Reprod. 1991; 45: 20-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). In blots used to assess the expression of NASP in HeLa and 3T3 cells, the blots were stained with amido black for protein to ensure equal loading, computer-imaged with a desktop scanner, destained, and immunostained with anti-NASP. Protein lysates of mouse embryo, spleen, and testis were made by grinding the minced tissue in a Dounce homogenizer with PBS and Protease Inhibitor Mixture Set 1 (Calbiochem) at the recommended dilution. The suspension was frozen, thawed, and centrifuged at 12,000 × g. After centrifugation, the supernatant was extracted (twice in chloroform and methanol (3:1)) and the volatile solvents removed by vacuum centrifugation (10 min). Protein concentrations were determined using Micro BCA protein detection reagents (Pierce). Mouse tissue sections and embryos were fixed in Bouin's solution, paraffin-embedded, sectioned, and incubated with rabbit anti-recombinant N-terminal NASP (affinity-purified) as primary antiserum. This antiserum recognizes both somatic and testicular NASP protein. Immunostaining was carried out as described (33Sivashanmugam P. Richardson R.T. Hall S. Hamil K.G. French F.S. O'Rand M.G. J. Androl. 1999; 20: 384-393PubMed Google Scholar). Cell cultures were grown on microscope slides with wells (Lab-Tek II chamber slides, Nalgene-Nunc, Naperville, IL). Medium was removed by aspiration and the cells washed twice with cold (4 °C) PBS. Methanol (−20 °C) was added to fix the cells (10 min, −20 °C). The cells were washed twice with cold PBS, blocked in 2% normal goat serum (20 min), and washed with cold PBS (twice, 5 min each). Rabbit anti-NASP or preimmune serum was added to each well (1:500 in PBS and 0.1% bovine serum albumin), the cells were incubated (45 min) and washed in PBS (3 times, 5 min each), and fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled goat anti-rabbit antiserum was added (1:1000 in PBS and 0.1% bovine serum albumin) for a 30-min incubation followed by three washes in PBS. The cells were also stained with propidium iodide (0.01 mg/ml, 10 min) and washed (3 times in PBS) before the plastic wells were removed. 66-2 mouse myeloma cells (34Laskov R. Scharff M.D. J. Exp. Med. 1970; 131: 515-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar) were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium-H plus 10% horse serum at 37 °C and 5% CO2. HeLa cells, mouse 3T3 fibroblasts, and CV-1 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium-H plus 10% calf serum. To obtain populations of cells in G2-phase, HeLa cells were arrested by double-thymidine block. Cells were blocked for 18 h with 2 mmthymidine, released for 9 h by washing out the thymidine, and blocked again with 2 mm thymidine for 17 h to arrest all of the cells at the beginning of S-phase. The cells were released by washing out the thymidine and total RNA and lysates prepared from samples taken at specific time points after release from thymidine. At 72 h after plating 3T3 cells, complete medium was removed, cells were washed three times with medium alone and incubated with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 0.5% calf serum for 48 h. At time 0 h, the low serum medium was removed, and the cells were stimulated by addition of medium containing 10% serum. The cell cycle positions of the HeLa and 3T3 cells were determined by analyzing the DNA content of propidium iodide-stained cells from each time point at the UNC Flow Cytometry Facility. Total cell RNA was prepared for the cell cycle studies using the Ultraspec RNA isolation system (Biotecx Laboratories Inc., Houston, TX). Cell lysates were prepared by washing the collected cells in PBS followed by lysis in 1% SDS and boiling for 5 min. In all cell cycle studies, equal RNA loading was verified by probing Northern blots with G3PDH, and the position of the cells in the cell cycle was monitored using FACS analysis (shown for Fig. 6). Rabbit antibodies to recombinant mouse NASP were affixed to Reactigel 6X (Pierce) and were used to affinity purify native NASP and its associated histones from lysates. Myeloma 66-2 cell pellets were thawed on ice and resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) with the addition of Protease Inhibitor Mixture I and Proteasome Inhibitor I (Calbiochem). Cell debris was pelleted in a microcentrifuge at maximum speed, and the supernatant was mixed with the NASP:Reactigel beads and rocked overnight at 4 °C. A column was made from the beads and was washed extensively with several volumes of PBS before elution with Immunopure elution buffer (Pierce). Collected fractions were immediately neutralized with 1 m Tris-Cl, pH 8.5, and elution of protein was tracked at 280 nm. Pooled fractions were dialyzed in 10,000 molecular weight cutoff Slidealyzer cassettes (Pierce) versus several changes of 1/20× PBS and lyophilized. H1 proteins from mouse myeloma cells or affinity-purified NASP were isolated as described by Brown and Sittman (35Brown D.T. Sittman D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 713-718Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Core histones were isolated from the perchloric acid-insoluble pellet by extraction with 0.2 m H2SO4, precipitated with trichloroacetic acid or 8 volumes of cold acetone, and washed with acetone, 0.01 m HCl. All procedures were done at 4 °C. Mouse histone H1 cDNAs (kindly provided by Dr. D. Sittman, University of Mississippi Medical Center) were expressed from a pET-11d vector. The histone H1 constructs were transformed into the BL21 (DE3) bacterial host cell line and the recombinant proteins purified using the T7 tag affinity purification kit (Novagen, Madison, WI) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Lyophilized histones were dissolved in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid and applied to a C-18 reverse-phase column (Waters, DeltaPak, 15 μm, 300 Å, 3.9 × 300 mm) equilibrated with acetonitrile and 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. Proteins were eluted at 28 °C with a multistep acetonitrile in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid gradient (0.7 ml/min). Gradients were developed from 18.5 to 100% buffer B (90% acetonitrile in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid) and 81.5 to 0% buffer A (10% acetonitrile in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid). Protein elution was monitored at 220 nm. Fractions were collected, dried by vacuum centrifugation, and analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Biotin labeling of histones was performed as described (4Batova I.A. O'Rand M.G. Biol. Reprod. 1996; 54: 1238-1244Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The binding of labeled histones to streptavidin-agarose was used to test the efficiency of biotinylation, and bound and unbound fractions were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. For binding experiments, rNASP (2 μg) was mixed with biotin-labeled histone H1 recombinants in a 500-μl volume of 0.5× Tris-buffered EDTA and incubated for 1 h at room temperature with gentle shaking. Precipitation was carried out with either streptavidin or affinity-purified anti-rNASP antibodies. The samples were loaded on 10–20% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. In the course of our studies on tNASP, it was of interest to ask whether or not the fertilizing spermatozoon would carry NASP into the unfertilized egg (5O'Rand M.G. Richardson R.T. Zimmerman L.J. Widgren E. Dev. Biol. 1992; 154: 37-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). However, contrary to expectations (2Welch J.E. Zimmerman L. Joseph D. O'Rand M.G. Biol. Reprod. 1990; 43: 559-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), NASP was detected with an anti-NASP antibody in the germinal vesicle of growing oocytes within the ovary (see Fig. 9 E). Subsequent screening of an ovarian cDNA library resulted in the isolation of a cDNA encoding sNASP, which differed from tNASP, suggesting that the ovarian cDNA was an alternatively spliced transcript. As a result of this observation, we began an extensive search for the presence of NASP in embryonic and somatic tissues. Fig.1 A shows the relationship between sNASP and tNASP cDNAs. The sNASP is identical to tNASP except for the deletion of the two separate regions, shown in Fig.1 A, reducing the size of sNASP to 421 amino acids (45,752 Da) from the 773 amino acids of tNASP (83,934 Da). The sequence for mouse tNASP (Fig. 1 B), obtained by screening a mouse testis cDNA library, yielded a 2543-bp consensus sequence. The sequence for sNASP (Fig. 1 B), obtained from the mouse ovary cDNA library yielded a consensus sequence of 1486 bp, which differs from tNASP cDNA in the 5′ UTR as well as in the deletion of two portions of the coding region. To confirm the sequence of sNASP in other somatic tissues, the complete sNASP coding region from spleen cDNA, generated by PCR, was sequenced and found to be identical to ovary sNASP (data not shown). The lack of two tNASP regions in the sNASP mRNA and the presence of differing sequences in the upstream portion of the 5′ UTR of sNASP are most likely explained by differential pre-mRNA splicing events and different promoters. Fig.1 C shows the relevant 5′ UTR sequences for the two NASP forms, indicating how the 5′ ends of the transcripts are alternatively spliced from the genomic sequence. The 5′ end of the testis mRNA arises by the splicing of two small exons (T1a and T1b, Fig. 1 C) onto the 5′ end of exon one (E-1). The unique portion of the 5′ UTR of sNASP, (S1, Fig. 1 C) is contiguous with the sequence (E-1) common to both sNASP and tNASP. A 3′ splice is evident at the end of S1 (Fig. 1 C). The splice junctions of the exons have been identified by sequencing genomic DNA (not shown). The deduced mouse tNASP protein sequence is 81% identical to human tNASP and retains the three histone binding sites (Fig.1 A) previously identified in human tNASP (4Batova I.A. O'Rand M.G. Biol. Reprod. 1996; 54: 1238-1244Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Additionally, the sNASP-deduced protein sequence has the same structural features found in all tNASP sequences (36O'Rand M.G. Batova I. Richardson R.T. The Testis (Goldberg, E., ed) Serono Symposium, Springer, New York2000: 143-150Google Scholar), including a nuclear localization signal, a leucine zipper, and an ATP/GTP binding site. Probing a multiple tissue Northern blot (CLONTECH) of mouse tissues with the tNASP coding region cDNA revealed a strong signal in mouse testis at 2.7 kb (<T) and a weaker signal at 1.7 kb (<S) in mouse liver, kidney, spleen, brain, and heart (Fig.2 A). Probing 66-2 mouse myeloma cell RNA revealed a strong 1.7-kb (<S) signal and a weaker 2.7-kb (<T) signal (Fig. 2 B). To assay a wider variety of tissues for NASP expression, a mouse mRNA master blot was probed with the tNASP coding region. As shown in Fig.3 A, testis mRNA showed the strongest signal, at least five times that found in 11-day-old embryos. Densitometeric analysis of the blot without the testis signal (Fig.3 B) revealed that the other most predominant signals were found in the thymus, spleen, ovary, and all embryonic stages, with peak expression on day 11. Epididymal tissue expressed approximately 20% of the 11-day-old embryo level, whereas all other tissues, including mRNAs from mouse brain, eye, liver, lung, kidney, heart, skeletal muscle, smooth muscle, pancreas, thyroid, submaxillary gland, prostate, and uterus, had weak signals (<20%). PCRs were performed with primers specific for the coding region common to both mouse sNASP and tNASP, employing a multiple tissue cDNA panel as the source of cDNA templates, including cDNAs from heart, brain, spleen, lung, liver, skeletal muscle, kidney, testis, and 7-, 11-, 15-, and 17-day embryos (Fig. 4). Agarose gel analysis of the PCR products showed the presence of a 2319-bp tNASP band only in the testis (<T, Fig. 4 A). However, all tissues, including the testis, produced a 1263-bp sNASP band (<S, Fig. 4 A). The PCRs of testis RNA were clearly inefficient in this assay, as the Northern blots show very little sNASP compared with tNASP in the testis (Fig. 2 A), probably because of the large size of the amplified testis fragments. Therefore, PCRs were performed using the cDNA panel and primers specific for a 725-bp sequence specific to tNASP from nucleotides 334 to 1059. Agarose gel analysis of these products showed 725-bp bands only from the testis and embryos, with a strong signal on day 11 but with faint signals in the other embryonic stages (<T, Fig. 4 B). Embryonic stage cDNAs did not give a 2319-bp band when amplified with common tNASP and sNASP coding region primers because of the inefficient amplification of the tNASP cDNA. Western blots of lysates (equal protein loading) from mouse testis, spleen, embryos, mouse 66-2 myeloma cell line, and mouse 3T3 cells were probed with anti-NASP antibodies. A strong tNASP band of 138 kDa was present in the testis, in myeloma cells, and in 3T3 cells, with a somewhat weaker band in embryos (Fig. 5). An sNASP band of 62 kDa was present in all of the lysates (Fig. 5). These results support the data presented in Figs. Figure 2, Figure 3, Figure 4, which show that tNASP is present in 3T3 cells, myeloma cells, and embryos but not in the spleen (Figs.Figure 2, Figure 3, Figure 4). Only sNASP is present in spleen. The addition of protease inhibitors to the lysates did not prevent the appearance of immunoreactive NASP breakdown products, particularly in the myeloma extract. No significant bands were seen when blots were probed with preimmune serum (Fig. 5). Recombinant 6-His-tagged tNASP also migrated at 138 kDa (data not shown). The anomalous migration of NASP and other similar nuclear proteins after SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis has been observed and discussed previously (1Welch J.E. O'Rand M.G. Biol. Reprod. 1990; 43: 569-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar).

IKKα and IKKβ are the two catalytic subunits of the IKK complex and two additional molecules, IKKγ/NEMO and IKAP, have been described as further integral members. We have analyzed the function of both proteins for IKK complex composition and NF-κB signaling. IKAP and IKKγ belong to distinct cellular complexes. Quantitative association of IKKγ was observed with IKKα and IKKβ. In contrast IKAP was complexed with several distinct polypeptides. Overexpression of either IKKγ or IKAP blocked tumor necrosis factor α induction of an NF-κB-dependent reporter construct, but IKAP in addition affected several NF-κB-independent promoters. Whereas specific down-regulation of IKKγ protein levels by antisense oligonucleotides significantly reduced cytokine-mediated activation of the IKK complex and subsequent NF-κB activation, a similar reduction of IKAP protein levels had no effect on NF-κB signaling. Using solely IKKα, IKKβ, and IKKγ, we could reconstitute a complex whose apparent molecular weight is comparable to that of the endogenous IKK complex. We conclude that while IKKγ is a stoichiometric component of the IKK complex, obligatory for NF-κB signaling, IKAP is not associated with IKKs and plays no specific role in cytokine-induced NF-κB activation.

The prototype of the NF-κB family is a heterodimer of the p50 and p65 (RelA) subunits. IκB proteins (IκBα, IκBβ, IκBε, p105, and p100) retain NF-κB in an inactive form in the cytoplasm. A conserved ankyrin repeat domain in these inhibitors masks nuclear translocation signals contained in the Rel homology domain of NF-κB. In response to multiple stimuli, including TNFα,1 IL-1β, phorbol ester, and lipopolysaccharides, NF-κB is liberated from IκB molecules and translocates to the nucleus (6Mercurio F. Manning A.M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 226-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar). This critical step of NF-κB activation is initiated by phosphorylation of IκB proteins at conserved amino-terminal serine residues, e.g. at serines 32 and 36 of IκBα or serines 19 and 23 of IκBβ. Phosphorylated IκBs are bound by a βTrCP containing ubiquitin ligase (E3) complex, polyubiquitinated and subsequently degraded by the 26 S proteasome (7Maniatis T. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 505-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar). Most NF-κB-inducing stimuli trigger activation of an IκB kinase (IKK) complex with a high apparent molecular mass of 700–900 kDa (8Mercurio F. Zhu H. Murray B.W. Shevchenko A. Bennett B.L. Li J.

IKKα and IKKβ are related molecules of 85 and 87 kDa, respectively, with an overall identity of about 44%. Both contain an NH2-terminal kinase domain, a leucine zipper and a COOH-terminal helix-loop-helix motif. IKKα and IKKβ form homo- or heterodimers via their leucine zipper (for review, see Ref. 14Karin M. Ben-Neriah Y. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2000; 18: 621-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (4106) Google Scholar). Both kinases are stimulated by proinflammatory cytokines and their activation kinetics match that of IκBα phosphorylation. Highly purified recombinant IKKα and IKKβ can phosphorylate IκBα and IκBβ directly at the correct sites, thus no further downstream kinases are required for IκB phosphorylation (15Li J. Peet G.W. Pullen S.S. Schembri King J. Warren T.C. Marcu K.B. Kehry M.R. Barton R. Jakes S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30736-30741Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 16Zandi E. Chen Y. Karin M. Science. 1998; 281: 1360-1363Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). IKKα and IKKβ also inducibly phosphorylate the NF-κB precursor protein p105 at three carboxyl-terminal serines and thereby trigger proteolysis of the precursor (17Heissmeyer V. Krappmann D. Wulczyn F.G. Scheidereit C. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4766-4778Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). The IKK complex appears to contain a IKKα/β heterodimer (9Zandi E. Karin M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4547-4551Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar), although in some cell types IKKβ homodimers are found as well (18Mercurio F. Murray B.W. Shevchenko A. Bennett B.L. Young D.B.

The recent generation of IKKα- or IKKβ-deficient mice has established the requirement of IKKβ for activation of NF-κB by proinflammatory stimuli (19Tanaka M. Fuentes M.E. Yamaguchi K. Durnin M.H.

In contrast, IKKα was found to be dispensable for these stimuli but was essential for morphogenic functions, including differentiation and proliferation of epidermal keratinocytes and skeletal development (22Hu Y.

The IKKα knock-out model also demonstrated that the signal responsiveness and activity of the resulting IKKβ homodimer in these animals is fully functional. A predominant role of IKKβ for proinflammatory signaling is also evident from the observation that mutation of two amino acids in the activation loop of IKKβ, but not in IKKα, blocks IKK activation by NIK or cytokines (25Delhase M. Hayakawa M. Chen Y. Karin M. Science. 1999; 284: 309-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (754) Google Scholar). In addition to the two kinases, the IKK complex has been reported to contain regulatory subunits. IKKγ (NEMO, IKKAP1) has been obtained by complementation cloning (26Yamaoka S. Courtois G. Bessia C. Whiteside S.T. Weil R. Agou F. Kirk H.E. Kay R.J. Israel A.

IKKγ is required for activation of NF-κB by TNFα, IL-1β, lipopolysaccharide, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, double stranded RNA, or the human T-cell lymphotrophic virus (HTLV-1) Tax, as shown with IKKγ-deficient cells or by overexpression of antisense cDNA (26Yamaoka S.

Most, if not all of the cellular IKKα and -β seems to be bound to IKKγ, the absence of which results in a shift of the apparent molecular mass of the IKK complex from 800–900 to 300–400 kDa (26Yamaoka S.

The COOH-terminal domains containing a leucine zipper and potential zinc finger could thus be interaction sites for signal transmitting molecules which activate IKKα or -β (18Mercurio F. Murray B.W. Shevchenko A. Bennett B.L. Young D.B. Li J.W. Pascual G. Motiwala A. Zhu H. Mann M. Manning A.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1526-1538Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 27Rothwarf D.M. Zandi E. Natoli G. Karin M. Nature. 1998; 395: 297-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (853) Google Scholar). IKKγ was also isolated in a yeast two-hybrid screen using the adenovirus-encoded E3-14.7K protein as a bait and was shown to interact with RIP and NIK in transfected cells (28Li Y. Kang J. Friedman J. Tarassishin L. Ye J. Kovalenko A. Wallach D. Horwitz M.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 1042-1047Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). The same adenovirus protein also interacts with Fip2, which shares 40% similarity with IKKγ and also contains coiled coils and a leucine zipper (29Li Y. Kang J. Horwitz M.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1601-1610Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). A further IKK-associated protein (IKAP) was isolated by affinity purification of the IKK complex using immobilized IκBα (30Cohen L. Henzel W.J. Baeuerle P.A. Nature. 1998; 395: 292-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). IKAP is a 150-kDa protein with an amino-terminal WD40-like repeat domain. IKAP was found to co-elute with large molecular size range proteins (900 kDa) and co-eluted with IKK activity. IKAP co-purified with IKKα, IKKβ, NIK, RelA, IκBα, and further proteins of 105, 100, 82, 80, 65, and 58 kDa. IKAP was reported to directly and independently interact with recombinant or transfected IKKα, IKKβ, and NIK. The sequestration of IKKs and NIK suggested a function of IKAP as a scaffold protein (30Cohen L. Henzel W.J. Baeuerle P.A. Nature. 1998; 395: 292-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). It is not clear whether all endogenous IKK complexes associate with IKAP or only a subset of IKKs. Furthermore, it is not known whether IKKγ and IKAP are present in the same IKK complexes and how many other components are commonly associated with heterodimers of IKKα and IKKβ. In this study we have analyzed the composition of cellular IKKα·IKKβ complexes. We come to the conclusion that with regard to composition the major IKK complex is only tripartite and consists exclusively of IKKα, -β, and -γ. With in vitro reconstitution experiments we show that an IKKα·β·γ complex displays a gel filtration profile which, like that of endogenous IKK complexes, corresponds to a large size of more than 800 kDa relative to standard proteins. Various protein-protein interaction and functional assays demonstrate that cellular IKK complexes do not contain IKAP as an intrinsic component. IKAP appears as part of a novel complex containing additional proteins of 100, 70, 45, and 39 kDa. Overexpression of IKAP interferes with the activity of a set of different NF-κB-dependent as well as independent reporter genes, suggesting a function in a more general gene expression mechanism. HeLa and 293 cells were grown in Dulbeco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, and 100 units/ml penicillin/streptomycin. For stimulation, cells were treated with 20 ng/ml TNFα (Biomol) or 10 ng/ml IL-1β (Promega). 293 cells were transiently transfected by the calcium phosphate precipitation method as described previously (17Heissmeyer V. Krappmann D. Wulczyn F.G. Scheidereit C. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4766-4778Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). DNA constructs and amounts are indicated in the figure legend. Stimulation using 50 ng/ml TNFα was carried out 6 h prior to lysis. Cells were lysed 24 h after transfection and luciferase measurement was done with the dual luciferase reporter kit (Promega) according to the manufacturer's protocol. For transfection of antisense oligonucleotides (GeneBlocs) HeLa cells were plated in 96-well dishes at 4000 cells/well the evening before transfection. Cells were transfected in triplicate with antisense or control oligonucleotides for up to 72 h in the presence of serum using a lipid-based delivery system (Atugen AG). Transfection efficiency was greater than 80% (data no shown). Cells were harvested and RNA or protein extracts were prepared 48 h after transfection. Relative amounts of mRNA were determined by Real Time TaqManTM PCR analysis using the ABI Prism 7700 system (PE Applied Biosystems). IKKγ was amplified by PCR from a BJAB cDNA and cloned into theHindIII/BamHI pcDNA3 (Invitrogen), which contains a sequence coding for a HA epitope cloned intoBamHI/XbaI. For bacterial expression IKKγ cDNA was cloned into pGEX-6-P1 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). pRL-TKluc was obtained from Promega. Flag-IKAPpRK5, ELAMlucpRK5, pRcHA-IKKα, and pRcHA-IKKβ were described elsewhere (13Zandi E. Rothwarf D.M. Delhase M. Hayakawa M. Karin M.

Nature. 1998; 395: 292-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). Antisense oligonucleotides (GeneBlocs) complementary to IKKγ and IKAP mRNA were generated (Atugen AG): 17794:24058 GB3.3 (5′-GTTTGAGATCTTCCAGCTGCATT-3′); 17783:24047 GB3.3 (5′-AGCACTTGGACAATCACCACATT-3′); 17785:24049 GB3.3 (5′-GACACCTGTCAGTCAGACCAAGG-3′). A randomized control oligonucleotide GBC 5′-{N}23-3′ was used in parallel. Anti-IKKγ antibody was raised against a peptide comprising amino acids 57–72 of the human IKKγ molecule and anti-IKAP antibody was raised against a peptide comprising the very carboxyl terminus of human IKAP (amino acids 1313–1332). Peptide synthesis and immunization was done by Eurogentec. Furthermore, IKKγ antibody (FL-419) from Santa Cruz was used for Western blotting. Polyclonal antibodies against p65 (A), IκBα (C-21), IκBβ (N-20), HA (Y-11) were obtained from Santa Cruz. Monoclonal antibodies were as follows: IKKα antibody (B78-1) and mouse IgG1isotype control, Pharmingen; IKKβ antibody, 10AG2,BIOSOURCE; Flag antibody, M5, Sigma. Whole cell extracts were analyzed by electrophoretic mobility shift assay and Western blotting essentially as described previously (31Krappmann D. Wulczyn F.G. Scheidereit C. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6716-6726Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). For the preparation of cytoplasmic, nuclear and chromatin extracts HeLa cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and swollen in buffer A (1 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm KCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol (DTT) plus protease inhibitors, 0.4 mm Pefabloc, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 μg/ml pepstatin A) for 10 min on ice. 0.15% Nonidet P-40 was added, thoroughly mixed, and spun down in a microcentrifuge. The supernatant was centrifuged for 10 min at 14,000 rpm and after addition of 10% glycerol used as cytoplasmic extract. The nuclei were shaken for 15 min in buffer C (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 20% glycerol, 0.42 m NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, plus protease inhibitors (see above)) and after centrifugation for 10 min at 14,000 rpm the supernatant was used as a nuclear extract. The pellet was washed once with ∼10 volumes of buffer C and directly taken up and boiled for 15 min in SDS loading buffer to elute proteins that are tightly bound to chromatin. Gel filtration analysis of endogenous proteins was either carried out from whole cell extracts of HeLa cells or cytoplasmic extracts of 70Z/3, 1.3E2 cells, or extracts of transiently transfected 293 cells. ∼2 × 107 HeLa cells were lysed in a 300-μl volume of 100 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 300 mm NaCl, 0.3% Nonidet P-40, 2 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, 10 mm NaF, 8 mm β-glycerophosphate, 0.1 mm orthovanadate, 10% glycerol plus protease inhibitors (0.4 mm Pefabloc, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 μg/ml pepstatin A). 300 μl of low salt buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 1 mm DTT plus protease inhibitors, see above) were added for dilution and 500 μl were applied to the gel filtration. Extracts from 70Z/3 cells and 1.3E2 cells were prepared as described (26Yamaoka S. Courtois G. Bessia C. Whiteside S.T. Weil R. Agou F. Kirk H.E. Kay R.J. Israel A. Cell. 1998; 93: 1231-1240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (951) Google Scholar). 6 mg of protein were analyzed by gel filtration. 100-mm plates of 293 cells were transiently transfected using calcium phosphate precipitation. Cells were lysed 48 h after transfection in 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 100 mmNaCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm EDTA, 5% glycerol, 10 mm NaF, 8 mm β-glycerophosphate, 0.1 mm orthovanadate and protease inhibitors (see above). Equal volumes for each transfection were used for gel filtration analysis. Bacterially expressed glutathione S-transferase-IKKγ was bound to glutathione-Sepharose 4B and glutathioneS-transferase was cleaved by PreScission protease (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Equal amounts (∼200 ng) of purified baculovirally expressed IKKα (15Li J. Peet G.W. Pullen S.S. Schembri King J. Warren T.C. Marcu K.B. Kehry M.R. Barton R. Jakes S. J. Biol.

All gel filtration chromatography was carried out on a Superose 6 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). 500-μl fractions were recovered and every other fraction was analyzed by Western blotting. The column was calibrated with the molecular mass marker proteins thyroglobulin (669 kDa), ferritin (440 kDa), catalase (232 kDa), and aldolase (158 kDa) (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). For in vitroco-immunoprecipitations proteins were translated in rabbit reticulocyte lysate in the presence of [35S]methionine using thein vitro transcription/translation kit from Promega. For immunoprecipitations, 3–10 μl of the translated products were mixed and preincubated for 1 h at 4 °C in HEPES, pH 7.9, 100 mm KCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm DTT, 0.4 mm Pefabloc, and 1 μg/ml leupeptin, pepstatin, and aprotinin. After pre-clearance with protein A-Sepharose for 1 h at 4 °C, HA or Flag antibody and fresh protein A-Sepharose were added and incubated for another hour. The samples were extensively washed in immunoprecipitation buffer, resuspended in SDS loading buffer, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. For co-immunoprecipitation of endogenous proteins whole cell extracts of HeLa cells were prepared using 100 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 300 mm NaCl, 0.3% Nonidet P-40, 2 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, 10 mm NaF, 8 mmβ-glycerophosphate, 0.1 mm orthovanadate, 10% glycerol plus protease inhibitors (see above). Extracts were diluted 1:1 with 10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 1 mm DTT plus protease inhibitors (see above). After preclearing for 1 h with protein A-Sepharose the extracts were incubated for 4 h with the antibodies and protein A-Sepharose. Precipitates were washed four times with 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.15% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm EDTA, boiled in SDS loading buffer, and analyzed by Western blotting. HeLa cells were labeled for 5 h with 100 μCi/ml [35S]methionine essentially as described previously (32Krappmann D. Emmerich F. Kordes U. Scharschmidt E. Dorken B. Scheidereit C. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 943-953Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). Cells were lysed in 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, 10 mmNaF, 8 mm β-glycerophosphate, 0.1 mmorthovanadate, 10% glycerol plus protease inhibitors (0.4 mm Pefabloc, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 μg/ml pepstatin A). Extracts were precleared with protein A-Sepharose for 1 h and immunoprecipitation was carried out overnight at 4 °C. Precipitates were washed three times with lysis buffer and boiled for 5 min in SDS loading buffer. The supernatant was applied on a SDS-PAGE and analyzed by autoradiography. To assay for IκB kinase activity, HeLa cells were transfected with antisense oligonucleotides against IKAP (GB47), IKKγ (GB58), or control GeneBlocs (GBC) and 48 h later the cells were treated for 5 min with TNFα or IL-1β. Cellular lysis, immunoprecipitation using IKKα antibody, and the in vitro kinase assay were performed exactly as described previously (32Krappmann D. Emmerich F. Kordes U. Scharschmidt E. Dorken B. Scheidereit C. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 943-953Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). IKKγ and IKAP have each been suggested to stably associate with IKKα and IKKβ (26Yamaoka S. Courtois G.

To analyze the contribution of IKKγ and IKAP we tested if both proteins are part of the same complex with IKKα and IKKβ in whole cell extracts from HeLa cells fractionated by gel filtration (Fig.1 A). IKKα, IKKβ, and IKKγ had an identical elution profile (fractions 12–16), with an apparent molecular mass between 700 and 900 kDa relative to molecular mass markers, as reported earlier (26Yamaoka S. Courtois G. Bessia C. Whiteside S.T. Weil R. Agou F. Kirk H.E. Kay R.J. Israel A. Cell. 1998; 93: 1231-1240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (951) Google Scholar). In contrast, IKAP was predominantly found in fractions containing proteins with lower apparent molecular mass (fractions 16–20), while only small amounts of IKAP co-eluted with the IKK complex and trailed into still much larger apparent sizes. In fact, IKAP peak elution roughly coincided with NF-κB·IκB complexes at an apparent molecular mass of 440–670 kDa (fractions 18–22). However, no association of IKAP and NF-κB·IκB complexes was observed after affinity purification with a p65 antibody (data not shown). Next we asked, whether the IKK complex disruption seen in IKKγ-deficient cells (26Yamaoka S. Courtois G. Bessia C. Whiteside S.T. Weil R. Agou F. Kirk H.E. Kay R.J. Israel A. Cell. 1998; 93: 1231-1240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (951) Google Scholar) would affect the gel filtration elution profile of IKAP. We analyzed 70Z/3 cells and the 70Z/3-derived mutant cell line, 1.3E2, that exhibits impaired NF-κB activation and lacks IKKγ (26Yamaoka S. Courtois G. Bessia C. Whiteside S.T. Weil R. Agou F.

In 1.3E2 cells, IKKα and -β elute at smaller apparent molecular masses, between 450 and 600 kDa (Fig.1 B). Thus, loss of IKKγ in 1.3E2 cells leads to a similar migration decrease of the IKKα·β complex compared with the parental 70Z/3 cells, as that observed between Tax-transformed Rat-1 fibroblasts and their IKKγ lacking variant (26Yamaoka S.

Despite the shift of IKKα peak elution from fraction 14 to fraction 18 in the absence of IKKγ, the elution of IKAP complexes remained unchanged with maximal elution around fraction 18. This strongly suggests that IKAP is not part of a regular complex with IKKα and IKKγ. To compare associations between IKKs and IKAP or IKKγ directly, we performed co-immunoprecipitations of in vitro translated epitope-tagged proteins (Fig.2 A). HA-IKKγ was mixed with Flag-IKAP. Whereas HA antibody efficiently precipitated HA-IKKγ and Flag antibody pulled down Flag-IKAP, neither protein was co-precipitated with the other (lanes 1–4). We also added Myc-tagged IKKα and IKKβ to the IKKγ and IKAP mixture (lanes 5–8). IKKα and IKKβ could be efficiently co-precipitated with HA-IKKγ, but under these conditions no significant association was seen with IKAP after precipitation with either HA or Flag antibodies. Similar results were obtained in transiently transfected 293 cells, where we observed tight association between IKKα, IKKβ, and IKKγ, but only a very weak association between IKKα, IKKβ, and IKAP (data not shown). These observations raised the question whether association between cellular IKKs and IKAP could be detected in intact cells. Whole cell extracts of HeLa cells were used for immunoprecipitations and subsequent Western blotting (Fig. 2 B). IKAP was specifically precipitated with the IKAP antibody (lane 3), but only very small amounts of IKAP were precipitated with antibodies directed against either IKKα or IKKγ (lanes 5 and 6) which were also seen with the IgG1 control (lane 4). Furthermore, the IKAP antibody did not co-precipitate IKKα (lane 3). Conversely, co-immunoprecipitation of IKKα and IKKγ using identical conditions was observed with either antibody (lanes 5 and6). We therefore conclude that IKAP is not stably associated with the IKK complex. Since NF-κB activation by the IKK complex is a cytoplasmic process, components which are involved in this process are expected to reside in the cytoplasm. We analyzed the cytoplasmic and nuclear distribution of IKAP, IKKα, and IKKγ and p65 in HeLa cells (Fig.3 A). Whereas IKKα, IKKγ, IKAP, and p65 were all found predominantly in"

PC molecules synthesized by these two pathways have different fatty acyl chain compositions and this has been postulated to be the major contributor to the observed effects on cell growth (3DeLong C. Shen Y.-J. Thomas M.J. Cui Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29683-29688Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). The diacylglycerol specificity of cholinephosphotransferase regulates the fatty acyl composition of de novo PC synthesized through the CDP choline pathway and thus would be predicted to participate in the regulation of PC pathway-dependent liver tumor development. We recently cloned and characterized a human dual specificity choline/ethanolaminephosphotransferase (hCEPT1) capable of using both CDP choline and CDP ethanolamine as substrates in vitro(22Henneberry A.L. McMaster C.R. Biochem. J. 1999; 339: 291-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Metabolic labeling experiments demonstrated this enzyme was able to reconstitute the synthesis of both PC and PE when expressed in a yeast strain in which the endogenous cholinephosphotransferase and ethanolaminephosphotransferase genes were inactivated. In the work presented here we de novo cloned two cDNAs, each coding for a splice variant of a human cholinephosphotransferase (hCPT1). The cDNA product was expressed for characterization in vitroand in vivo and was found to code for a cholinephosphotransferase-specific enzyme.DISCUSSIONThe final steps in the Kennedy pathways for the synthesis of PC and PE are catalyzed by cholinephosphotransferase and ethanolaminephosphotransferase activities, respectively (10McMaster C.R.

The hCPT1 cDNA described in this study codes for an enzyme that demonstrated cholinephosphotransferase activity in in vitroenzyme assays, and in yeast devoid of their endogenous cholinephosphotransferase activity, hCPT1 was able to reconstitute the PC biosynthetic pathway in vivo. The hCPT1 enzyme was unable to use CDP ethanolamine as a substrate in vitro and was unable to reconstitute the PE biosynthetic pathway in vivo. This is in contrast to our previously isolated human hCEPT1 cDNA, which encoded an activity capable of using both CDP choline and CDP ethanolamine as substrates in vitro and in vivo(22Henneberry A.L. McMaster C.R. Biochem. J. 1999; 339: 291-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). It has been presumed that Kennedy pathways for the synthesis of PC and PE are completely separate in mammalian cells (49Kent C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 315-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar, 50Vance D.E. Vance D.E. Vance J.E. Biochemistry of Lipids, Lipoproteins and Membranes. Elsevier, Amsterdam1996: 153-182Google Scholar); however, the redundancy of cholinephosphotransferase activity in both the hCPT1 and hCEPT1 enzymes and the dual specificity of hCEPT for the synthesis of PC and PE imply that these two pathways may not be metabolically distinct. Indeed, the hCEPT1 mRNA distribution was similar in all tissues tested, whereas the hCPT1 mRNA varied greater than 100-fold between the same tissues, implying tissue-specific expression of hCPT1. Consistent with different functions for hCPT1 and hCEPT1 was the ability of hCEPT1, and not hCPT1, to complement the yeastCPT1 protein in mediatingSEC14-dependent cell growth, even though both hCEPT1 and hCPT1 both reconstituted in vivo PC synthesis to levels similar to those provided by the yeast CPT1 gene product. In plants there is evidence that PC and PE are synthesized by a dual specificity choline/ethanolaminephosphotransferase (51Dewey R.E. Wilson R.F. Novitzky W.P. Goode J.H. Plant Cell. 1994; 6: 1495-1507PubMed Google Scholar, 52Justin A.M. Demandue C. Tremolieres A. Mazliak P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1985; 836: 1-7Crossref Scopus (26) Google Scholar), and it will be interesting to determine if hCEPT1 can perform both functions in mammalian cells. A Chinese hamster ovary cell line had been produced by random mutagenesis with a specific defect in ethanolaminephosphotransferase activity (53Polokoff M.A. Wing D.C. Raetz C.R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 7687-7690Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and it would have been illuminating to express the hCPT1 and hCEPT1 products in this cell line; unfortunately, this cell line is no longer available.Consistent with our hypothesis that hCPT1 and hCEPT1 functions may not be metabolically distinct was an examination of the expressed sequence tag data bases, which failed to uncover other mammalian cDNAs with similarity to hCPT1 or hCEPT1. This implies the two cDNAs isolated to date likely comprise the total complement of human cholinephosphotransferase- and ethanolaminephosphotransferase-encoded activities. This would be similar to the demonstrated gene complement in S. cerevisiae (CPT1 andEPT1) (29Hjelmstad R.H. Morash S.C. McMaster C.R. Bell R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20995-21002Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and an examination of the completed C. elegans data base also revealed only two genes coding for enzymes with similarity to hCPT1 and hCEPT1 (54Stein L.D. Trends Genet. 1999; 15: 425-427Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Inconsistent with the hypothesis that hCEPT1 may function in both the CDP choline and CDP ethanolamine pathways in mammalian cells is the report of an ethanolaminephosphotransferase-specific enzyme purified to near homogeneity from bovine liver (15Mancini A. Del Rosso F. Roberti R. Orvietani P. Coletti L. Binaglia L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1437: 80-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). It will be interesting to determine if the purified ethanolaminephosphotransferase is indeed coded for by the bovine CEPT1 gene, but confirmation awaits peptide sequencing of the purified protein.A PAF-specific cholinephosphotransferase activity had been previously distinguished from the PC-specific cholinephosphotransferase enzyme based on DTT sensitivity (17Snyder F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1348: 111-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 18Woodard D.S. Lee T.-C. Snyder F. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 2520-2527Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Microsomal membranes contained a PAF-specific cholinephosphotransferase activity that was moderately stimulated by DTT and a PC-specific cholinephosphotransferase activity that was inhibited by DTT. We found that the cloned hCPT1 and hCEPT1 were both able to synthesize PAF in vitro. The hCPT1 PAF-synthesizing activity was stimulated and dependent on DTT, whereas the hCEPT1 PAF synthesizing activity was unaffected by DTT. Neither hCPT1 nor hCEPT1 PC biosynthetic activity was inhibited by DTT. Hence, neither the hCPT1 nor the hCEPT1-encoded cholinephosphotransferase activities reflected those previously observed in mammalian microsomes for the synthesis of PAF and PC. As yeast do not contain ether linked lipids, the precise in vivo substrate specificity for the synthesis of ether-linked PC molecules by hCPT1 and hCEPT1 awaits the development of mammalian systems for subsequent analyses. However, we predict simple overexpression systems are unlikely to provide insight into hCPT1 and hCEPT1 substrate specificities as the cholinephosphotransferase step is not rate-limiting in the pathway, and thus more complicated knockout or antisense strategies will likely have to evolve; these are currently under development. Phosphatidylcholine (PC)1 and phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) are the two most abundant phospholipids found in eukaryotic cells, generally comprising 50 and 25% of cellular phospholipid mass, respectively (1Raetz C.R.H. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1986; 20: 253-295Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). PC synthesis via the CDP choline pathway is responsible for essentially all de novo PC biosynthetic activity in all eukaryotic cell types thus far examined except (i) the liver where the methylation of phosphatidylethanolamine is predicted to contribute to 30% of net synthesis (2Ridgway N.D.

Chem. 1999; 274: 29683-29688Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar) and (ii) yeast where the supply of exogenous choline dictates the relative contribution of the two PC biosynthetic pathways (4McMaster C.R.

PE can also be synthesized by alternate routes with the CDP ethanolamine pathway supplemented by the decarboxylation of phosphatidylserine to PE, with the relative contribution of each route dependent on cell type (6Stone S.J.

The final step in the CDP alcohol pathways for the synthesis of PC and PE is catalyzed by cholinephosphotransferase and ethanolaminephosphotransferase enzyme activities, respectively. Cholinephosphotransferase catalyzes the transfer of phosphocholine from CDP choline to diacylglycerol (DAG) with the release of CMP and the formation of PC (10McMaster C.R. Bell R.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1348: 100-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 11McMaster C.R. Bell R.M. J. Biol.

Smith S.W. Kennedy E.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1958; 231: 53-64Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), whereas the ethanolaminephosphotransferase reaction catalyzes a similar transfer substituting CDP ethanolamine as the phosphobase donor resulting in the formation of PE (14McMaster C.R.

A cholinephosphotransferase has also been implicated in de novo synthesis of platelet-activating factor (PAF) (17Snyder F. Biochim. Biophys.

This putative PAF-specific cholinephosphotransferase was identified based on DTT susceptibility of cholinephosphotransferase activities measured in microsomal membranes, with PAF-specific activity being DTT resistant and PC-specific activity being DTT sensitive (18Woodard D.S. Lee T.-C. Snyder F. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 2520-2527Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The relative contribution of the CDP choline versus PE methylation pathways for the synthesis of PC have been implicated in regulating cell growth in the mammalian liver. PC synthesis through the CDP choline pathway favored proliferation, whereas PC synthesized by PE methylation inhibited cell growth and was negatively associated with the induction of liver tumor formation (19Cui Z.

As yeast do not contain ether linked lipids, the precise in vivo substrate specificity for the synthesis of ether-linked PC molecules by hCPT1 and hCEPT1 awaits the development of mammalian systems for subsequent analyses. However, we predict simple overexpression systems are unlikely to provide insight into hCPT1 and hCEPT1 substrate specificities as the cholinephosphotransferase step is not rate-limiting in the pathway, and thus more complicated knockout or antisense strategies will likely have to evolve; these are currently under development.

https://openalex.org/W1987182460,"Human neutrophils participate in the host innate immune response, partly mediated by the multicomponent superoxide-generating enzyme NADPH oxidase. A correlation between phosphorylation of cytosolic NADPH oxidase components and enzyme activation has been identified but is not well understood. We previously showed that p22 phox, the small subunit of the membrane-bound oxidase component flavocytochromeb 558, is an in vitro substrate for both a phosphatidic acid-activated kinase and conventional protein kinase C isoforms (Regier, D. S., Waite, K. A., Wallin, R., and McPhail, L. C. (1999) J. Biol. Chem. 274, 36601–36608). Here we show that several neutrophil agonists (phorbol myristate acetate, opsonized zymosan, andN-formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine) induce p22 phox phosphorylation in intact neutrophils. To determine if phospholipase D (PLD) is needed for p22 phox phosphorylation, cells were pretreated with ethanol, which reduces phosphatidic acid production by PLD in stimulated cells. Phorbol myristate acetate-induced phosphorylation of p22 phox and NADPH oxidase activity were not reduced by ethanol. In contrast, ethanol reduced both activities when cells were stimulated byN-formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine or opsonized zymosan. Varying the time of stimulation with opsonized zymosan showed that the phosphorylation of p22 phox coincides with NADPH oxidase activation. GF109203X, an inhibitor of protein kinase C and the phosphatidic acid-activated protein kinase, decreased both p22 phox phosphorylation and NADPH oxidase activity in parallel in opsonized zymosan-stimulated cells. Stimulus-induced phosphorylation of p22 phox was on Thr residue(s), in agreement with in vitro results. Overall, these data show that NADPH oxidase activity and p22 phox phosphorylation are correlated and suggest two mechanisms (PLD-dependent and -independent) by which p22 phox phosphorylation occurs.

These phagocytic cells produce superoxide anion, a precursor of antibacterial oxygen radicals, upon activation of NADPH oxidase. This multicomponent enzyme consists of both cytosolic and membrane-bound proteins in the resting state.

Neutrophil activation leads to the translocation of the cytosolic NADPH oxidase components to the membrane, where they interact with flavocytochrome b 558 (reviewed in Ref. 13DeLeo F.R. Quinn M.T. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1996; 60: 677-691Crossref PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar). Assembly of the NADPH oxidase components is required for activation of electron flow, possibly by inducing a conformational change within the flavocytochrome b 558 component (reviewed in Refs. 13DeLeo F.R. Quinn M.T. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1996; 60: 677-691Crossref PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar and 14McPhail L.C. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 180: 2011-2015Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). In intact neutrophils, several signaling mechanisms, initiated by receptor-ligand interactions, are involved in the regulation of NADPH oxidase (reviewed in Refs. 1McPhail L.C. Harvath L.

These events include activation of phospholipases, production of lipid second messengers, activation of protein kinases, and phosphorylation of neutrophil proteins and NADPH oxidase components. Activation of phospholipase A2 and production of arachidonic acid is required for NADPH oxidase activity (16Dana R. Malech H.L. Levy R. Biochem.

Phospholipase C also may be involved in NADPH oxidase activation (18Meshulam T. Diamond R.D. Lyman C.A. Wysong D.R. Melnick D.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Production of diacylglycerol by phospholipase C can induce activation of protein kinase C (PKC), which may mediate the phosphorylation of several NADPH oxidase components (see below) and is clearly an important regulator of NADPH oxidase activation (21Korchak H.M.

Thus, multiple phospholipases and lipid-regulated protein kinases are likely to be involved in NADPH oxidase activation. Phosphorylation of neutrophil proteins is induced by many neutrophil agonists, including phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA),N-formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine (fMLP), and opsonized zymosan (OPZ) (35Heyworth P.G. Badwey J.A. J. Bioenerg. Biomem. 1990; 22: 1-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). NADPH oxidase activation can be significantly reduced by the addition of protein kinase inhibitors, suggesting that protein kinase-dependent events are required for enzyme activation (reviewed in Ref. 33McPhail L.C.

The phosphorylated protein can then interact with p22 phox to facilitate assembly of NADPH oxidase. Phosphorylation of p47 phox in vitro is mediated by all families of PKC isoforms (conventional, novel, and atypical) as well as by mitogen-activated protein kinase, p21 rac -activated protein kinase, and a novel PA-activated protein kinase (34Regier D.S.

The membrane and cytosol fractions were prepared by ultracentrifugation, using a 15/40% discontinuous sucrose gradient, as described previously (41Caldwell S.E. McCall C.E. Hendricks C.L. Leone P.A. Bass D.A. McPhail L.C. J. Clin. Invest. 1988; 81: 1485-1496Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Membrane fractions were immediately solubilized with radioimmune precipitation buffer (see below) or stored at −70 °C overnight for solubilization with n-octyl- β-d-glucopyranoside. For PLD assays, neutrophils were labeled with 1-O-[9′,10′-3H]hexadecyl-2-acyl-glycerophosphatidylcholine, as described previously (47Bauldry S.A. Wooten R.E. Biochem. J. 1997; 322: 353-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 51Agwu D.E. McCall C.E. McPhail L.C. J. Immunol. 1991; 146: 3895-3903PubMed Google Scholar). In brief, purified neutrophils were resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline without Ca2+ or Mg2+ and incubated with 1-O-[9′,10′-3H]hexadecyl-2-lyso-glycerophosphatidylcholine (∼0.5 μCi/107 cells) for 30 min at 37 °C. Using these conditions, the label is converted to 1-O-[9′,10′-3H]hexadecyl-2-acyl-glycerophosphatidylcholine (48Chilton F.H. Ellis J.M. Olson S.C. Wykle R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 12014-12019Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were then washed twice and resuspended in Hanks' balanced salt solution with Ca2+ and Mg2+. The neutrophils (107 cells/ml) were stimulated with OPZ (10 mg/ml) for various lengths of time, as described in the legend to Fig. 3. Reactions were stopped by the addition of CH3OH/CHCl3/2% formic acid (2:1:0.2, v/v/v) (52Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (43132) Google Scholar). The aqueous layer was washed twice with CHCl3, and the CHCl3 layers were pooled and dried. The resulting lipids were separated by TLC, as described previously (27Bauldry S.A. Bass D.A. Cousart S.L. McCall C.E. J. Biol.

Two methods for membrane solubilization and immunoprecipitation were used, with similar results. The first solubilization method usedn-octyl-β-d-glucopyranoside, as described previously (53Quinn M.T. Parkos C.A. Jesaitis A.J. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 255: 476-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), with the addition of protease and phosphatase inhibitors (25 mm NaF, 1 mm p-nitrophenyl phosphate, 5 mmNa3VO4, 1 μm microcystin, 10 μm benzamidine, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μmpepstatin, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1 μmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) in the buffers used (34Regier D.S.

Alternately, membranes were solubilized with 1× radioimmune precipitation buffer (10 mm Na x PO4, pH 7.0, 0.05% SDS, 1% sodium deoxycholic acid, 0.15 m NaCl, 1% nonidet P-40, 1% t-octylphenoxypolyethoxyethanol, 50 mmNaF, 5 mm EGTA, 5 mm EDTA, 10 μmbenzamidine, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μm pepstatin, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 mm Na3VO4, 1 μmmicrocystin, 1 mm p-nitrophenyl phosphate, 1 μm staurosporine) for 60 min on ice (54DeLeo F.R.

Two methods for immunoprecipitation were used. In the first method, CNBr-activated Sepharose beads were conjugated to either mAb 44.1 or the isotype control, according to the manufacturer's directions (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Solubilized membrane was precleared with isotype control antibody-conjugated beads and then incubated with the mAb 44.1-conjugated (∼150 μg of solubilized membrane protein/15 μl of antibody-conjugated beads) at 4 °C for 16 h. Alternately, solubilized membrane fractions were precleared with IgG2B for 1 h in the presence of protein A-Sepharose (500 μg of solubilized membrane/20 μg of IgG2B). The IgG2B-bound protein A-Sepharose was removed. The supernatant was mixed with SDS (1% final concentration) and boiled for 10 min. After boiling, samples were placed on ice and immediately diluted with ice-cold radioimmune precipitation buffer without SDS (0.1% final concentration of SDS). Samples were then subjected to immunoprecipitation with mAb 44.1 and protein A-Sepharose for 4 h (500 μg of solubilized membrane/20 μg of mAb 44.1). The resulting beads were washed 4–8 times with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, and the immunoprecipitated proteins were analyzed by separation on 14% or 8–15% polyacrylamide gels using SDS-PAGE. Protein samples were prepared for analysis by SDS-PAGE using Laemmli sample buffer (55Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar) and separated on 14% or 8–15% polyacrylamide gels using SDS-PAGE.

Various signal transduction pathways, including protein phosphorylation can regulate the activity of BKCa channels, along with many other membrane ion channels. In our study, we have examined the regulation of BKCa channels by the cellular Src gene product (c Src), a soluble tyrosine kinase that has been implicated in the regulation of both voltage- and ligand-gated ion channels. Using a heterologous expression system, we observed that co-expression of murine BKCa channel and the human c Src tyrosine kinase in HEK 293 cells led to a calcium-sensitive enhancement of BKCa channel activity in excised membrane patches. In contrast, co-expression with a catalytically inactive c Src mutant produced no change in BKCa channel activity, demonstrating the requirement for a functional c Src molecule. Furthermore, we observed that BKCa channels underwent direct tyrosine phosphorylation in cells co-transfected with BKCa channels and active c Src but not in cells co-transfected with the kinase inactive form of the enzyme. A single Tyr to Phe substitution in the C-terminal half of the channel largely prevented this observed phosphorylation. Given that c Src may become activated by receptor tyrosine kinases or G-protein-coupled receptors, these findings suggest that c Src-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation of BKCa channels in situ may represent a novel regulatory mechanism for altering membrane potential and calcium entry.

A direct physiologic consequence of this behavior is that BKCa channels act as “coincidence detectors” and regulate, in a feedback fashion, cellular processes stimulated by close temporal changes in membrane potential and intracellular calcium. That BKCa channels indeed play such a role is evidenced by the fact that blocking these channels increases the degree of myogenic tone observed in arterial smooth muscle (1Brayden J.E. Nelson M.T.

Given their potential to influence cellular processes, it is not surprising that BKCa channels are also targets of cellular signaling pathways, including phosphorylation and dephosphorylation reactions (6Reinhart P.H.

Nature. 1994; 368: 850-853Crossref PubMed Scopus (1510) Google Scholar). To date, however, many of the molecular aspects of these regulatory events remain poorly understood. Of these various cellular pathways, protein phosphorylation remains as one of the most common forms of intracellular signaling and is critically involved in every aspect of eukaryotic cell function from muscle contraction to gene transcription to cell division. Adding to this richness was the discovery in the late 1970s that tyrosine residues may also be phosphorylated, and since then, tyrosine phosphorylation has emerged as a critical process, particularly in the regulation of cellular growth and development (15Hunter T. Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond-Biol. Sci. 1998; 353: 583-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar). However, more recent observations have pointed to an additional role for tyrosine phosphorylation in the control of cellular excitability, via the modulation of both voltage-dependent and ligand-operated ion channels. Nonreceptor tyrosine kinases, Src or pp60c-Src in particular, have been shown to regulate a variety of membrane ion channels, including fast type A γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptors (16Moss S.J.

These effects range from enhancement to inhibition of channel activity, and in some cases, a Src tyrosine kinase has been shown to be physically associated with the ion channel complex (18Yu X.-M. Askalan R. Keil G.J. Salter M.W. Science. 1997; 275: 674-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar, 22Holmes T.C. Fadool D.A. Ren R. Levitan I.B. Science. 1996; 274: 2089-2091Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). These findings thus expand our picture of ion channel regulation to include tyrosine along with serine/threonine phosphorylation as critical regulatory events in the control of membrane excitability. In the current study, we have examined the effects of the human Src tyrosine kinase on the functional behavior of a murine BKCa channel using a transient co-expression strategy. Our results indicate that the c Src tyrosine kinase can enhance BKCa channel activity in a calcium-dependent manner and that BKCa channels undergo tyrosine phosphorylation as a consequence of co-expression. Akhand et al. (25Akhand A.A. Pu M. Senga T. Kato M. Suzuki H. Miyata T. Hamaguchi M. Nakashima I. J. Biol.

Src-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation may thus represent a generalized cellular mechanism by which BKCa channel activity can be regulated in response to diverse cellular stimuli. LipofectAMINE and high glucose-containing Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium cell culture medium were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. DNA modifying enzymes were obtained from New England Biolabs.

The cDNA encoding the mouse brain m Slo α subunit (26Pallanck L. Ganetzky B. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1994; 3: 1239-1243Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar) was obtained from Dr. L. Pallanck (University of Wisconsin), and a ∼3.7-kilobase fragment was subcloned into the SV-40 promoter-based mammalian expression plasmid SRα (27Takebe Y. Seiki M. Fujisawa J.-I. Hoy P. Yokota K. Arai K.-I. Yoshida M. Arai N. Mol. Cell Biol. 1988; 8: 466-472Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) as follows. The EcoRI site of SRα and the BamHI site at the 5′ end of the m Slo cDNA were blunted with Klenow fragment and a NotI linker was ligated to these ends. The XbaI site at the 3′ end of the m Slo cDNA was then blunted with Klenow fragment, and the insert cDNA was ligated between the NotI and EcoRV restriction sites in the polylinker region of the plasmid. The cDNA encoding the wild-type green fluorescent protein (28Chalfie M. Tu Y. Euskirchen G. Ward W.W. Prasher D.C.

A full-length cDNA encoding human Src tyrosine kinase (Dr. D. Fujita, University of Calgary) was subcloned into SRα using the EcoRI site. Site-directed mutagenesis of both the mSlo α subunit and cSrc cDNAs was carried out using the Transformer mutagenesis kit (CLONTECH Laboratories). An epitope-tagged form of m Slo was also prepared by insertion of the seven-amino acid sequence EEFMPME (29Grussenmeyer T. Scheidtmann K.H. Hutchinson M.A. Eckhart W. Walter G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

The presence of this tag did not alter the intrinsic voltage- or calcium-dependent gating of these modified channels following expression (data not shown). The enzymatically “dead” form of c Src was prepared by a Lys to Met mutation at position 298 in the catalytic domain of the kinase (31Hanks S.K. Quinn A.M. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 200: 38-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (1080) Google Scholar). HEK 293 cells (32DuBridge R.B. Tang P. Hsia H.C. Leong P.-M. Miller J.H. Calos M.P. Mol. Cell Biol. 1987; 7: 379-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (915) Google Scholar) were obtained from Dr. M. Calos (Department of Genetics, Stanford University) and were maintained at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 incubator in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing l-glutamine, 4.5 g/liter d-glucose and 10% (v/v) characterized fetal bovine serum (Hyclone Laboratories, Logan, UT). Transient transfection of cells at 50–80% confluency was carried out in 35-mm tissue culture dishes using the lipofection technique. Briefly, 6–8 μl of LipofectAMINE was mixed together with 1.2–1.5 μg of plasmid cDNA in 1 ml of serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and placed on cells for 5–6 h at 37 °C in a humidified incubator containing 5% CO2. DNA-containing medium was then aspirated and replaced with serum-containing medium. The following day, cells were detached using 0.025% trypsin/0.5 mm EDTA in phosphate-buffered saline and replated onto sterile glass coverslips and 10-cm culture dishes. Electrophysiological recordings were typically performed on days 2–4 following transfection. For Western blotting and enzymatic assays, cells were harvested on day 3 or 4 following transfection. Macroscopic currents were recorded at 35 ± 0.5 °C from excised inside/out membrane patches of HEK 293 cells using an Axopatch 200B patch clamp amplifier and pClamp 6.03 software. BKCa channel currents from native m Sloor the epitope-tagged m Slo (see above) were activated by voltage clamp pulses delivered from a holding potential of 0 mV to membrane potentials ranging from −180 to 240 mV; tail currents were recorded at +50, −80, or −120 mV. Current traces were filtered at 2–5 kHz (4-pole Bessel filter) and acquired on a Dell Dimension XPS computer at a sampling frequency of 8–10 kHz using a Digidata 1200 analogue/digital interface. Recording micropipettes were pulled from thin walled borosilicate glass capillaries (inner diameter, 1.2 mm; outer diameter, 1.5 mm; World Precision Instruments, Sarasota, FL) using a Sutter P-89 horizontal electrode puller. Micropipettes were filled with a solution containing 5 mm KCl, 140 mm KOH, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, and 10 mm HEPES, with a pH adjusted to 7.3 with methanesulfonic acid and had tip resistances of 2–4 MΩ. The bath solution contained 5 mm KCl, 140 mm KOH, 1 mm MgCl2, 2 mm EGTA or N-(2-hydroxyethyl)EDTA, and 10 mm HEPES with a pH adjusted to 7.2 with methanesulfonic acid; variable amounts of a 0.1 m CaCl2 solution were added to give the desired free calcium concentrations. The level of free calcium in each solution was confirmed using a calcium electrode (Orion model 93–20) with calibration standards (WPI, Sarasota, FL) ranging from pCa 8 to 2. The recording chamber (volume, ∼0.3 ml) was perfused at a constant rate of 1–1.5 ml/min, using a set of manually controlled solenoid valves to switch between various solutions. Transfected HEK 293 cells plated on coverslips were placed in a temperature-controlled recording chamber on the stage of a Nikon TE 300 Eclipse inverted microscope. Individual cells expressing BKCa channels were then identified visually by co-expression of the marker protein green fluorescent protein under epifluorescence using 480 nm excitation and 510 nm emission filters. Based on the number of green fluorescent cells, transfection efficiency was judged to be 20–30% in any given experiment. Frozen pellets of transfected cells were thawed on ice and then resuspended in 1.0 ml of ice-cold RIPA buffer containing 50 mm Tris HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm Na3VO4, 10 mm NaF, 1 mm EDTA, 0.2 mm EGTA, 0.5% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 0.1% (w/v) SDS, 0.3% (w/v) sodium deoxycholate, and 2 μg/ml each aprotinin and leupeptin. The crude cell lysates were kept on ice for ∼10 min and then centrifuged at 15,000 rpm for 5 min at 4 °C to remove insoluble materials. Following transfer to clean microcentrifuge tubes, the supernatants were precleared by incubation with 20 μl of protein A/G-agarose (Santa Cruz Biotech) on a rotator for 1 h at 4 °C. The agarose beads were pelleted by centrifugation at 15,000 rpm for 5 min, and the supernatants were again transferred to clean tubes and then incubated for 2 h at 4 °C with 4–5 μg/tube of the mouse anti-Src monoclonal antibody 327. Following addition of 20 μl of protein A/G-agarose per tube, samples were again rotated at 4 °C for an additional hour and then centrifuged for 2 min at 10,000 rpm. The pelleted materials were washed twice by gentle resuspension in 1 ml of RIPA buffer and then centrifuged as above. Following the second wash, the pelleted materials were washed in 1 ml of ice-cold buffer containing 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, and 10% (v/v) glycerol. Liquid from each sample was then aspirated, and the immunoprecipitates were assayed immediately for tyrosine kinase activity. c Src-dependent tyrosine kinase activity was measured at 30 °C in a final assay volume of 50 μl containing 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.8, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mmMgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.2 mmNa3VO4, 4 mg/ml p-nitro-phenylphosphate, and 100 μmcdc26–20 peptide substrate (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.). The reaction was started by addition of [γ-32P]ATP (final concentration, 10 μm; 2000–3000 cpm/pmol) and stopped at various times by adding a 40-μl aliquot from each reaction mixture to tubes containing 25 μl of 50% (v/v) acetic acid. A 60-μl aliquot from each tube was then spotted onto a P81 paper disc (Whatman), followed by washes for 5–10 min in 3× 500 ml volumes of 0.5% (v/v) phosphoric acid. P81 paper discs were then briefly rinsed in acetone and dried. Radioactivity bound to the discs was measured by Cerenkov counting in a Beckman model LS6000SC liquid scintillation counter. Transfected cells were detached on day 3 by brief incubation with sterile phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.05% trypsin and 0.5 mm EDTA centrifuged in 15-ml culture tubes at ∼100 × g for 5 min and stored at −80 °C as intact cell pellets. These pellets were resuspended in 0.5–1 ml of ice-cold lysis buffer containing 1× TBS, 1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 1 mm EGTA, 2 mm EDTA, 10 mm NaF, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 5 μg/ml each of leupeptin and aprotinin and then sonicated for 5–10 s to shear the genomic DNA. Lysates were mixed with Laemmli sample buffer containing 0.5% (v/v) β-mercaptoethanol and incubated for 20–30 min at 70 °C, and the proteins then separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The resolved proteins were electrotransferred to nitrocellulose membrane at 4 °C in a buffer containing 25 mm Tris, 192 mm glycine, 0.1% (w/v) SDS, and 20% (v/v) methanol either for ∼2 h at 80–90 V or overnight at 35 V. Membranes were first dried in a fume hood to fix proteins and then briefly rinsed in a buffer containing 20 mm Tris HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, and 0.1% (v/v) Tween-20 (TTBS). Membranes were incubated at room temperature for 20–30 min in TTBS containing 5% (w/v) skim milk powder to block nonspecific binding of antibodies and then rinsed three times for 5 min in TTBS. Incubation of membranes with primary antibodies was carried out in TTBS containing 1% (w/v) skim milk powder for 1–2 h at room temperature, followed by three to five 10-min washes with TTBS alone. Membranes were then incubated for ∼1 h with the appropriate secondary antibody also diluted in TTBS/1% (w/v) skim milk powder, followed by three to five 5-min washes with TTBS. After the final wash, blots were immediately developed by applying the SuperSignal chemiluminescence reagent for 2–3 min and then exposing the blots to x-ray film (Hyperfilm; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). In HEK 293 cells transiently transfected with cDNAs encoding green flourescent protein and a mouse brain mSlo α subunit (26Pallanck L. Ganetzky B. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1994; 3: 1239-1243Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar), the pore-forming subunit of a large conductance, calcium-sensitive K+ channel, voltage clamp steps ranging from −180 to 240 mV gave rise to large, outwardly rectifying macroscopic currents in excised inside/out membrane patches (Fig.1). In contrast, membrane patches from cells transfected with green fluorescent protein alone displayed only negligible currents in response to the same voltage clamp steps (data not shown). Increasing the cytoplasmic free Ca2+ from 0 to ∼120 μm was observed to have several effects on the macroscopic currents: 1) a shift in the voltage for half-maximal activation of current to more negative membrane potentials, 2) an increase in the maximal current amplitude, and 3) an increase in the speed of current activation (Fig. 1, A–E). Normalized conductance-voltage (G-V) relations derived from tail current measurements (Fig. 1 F) document the shifts to the left in channel gating along the voltage axis with increasing free intracellular calcium. These observations are thus similar to those recently reported by others (33Bulter A. Tsunoda S. McCobb D.P. Wei A. Salkoff L.

Several investigators have already reported that BKCachannel activity can be modulated by G-protein and phosphorylation/dephosphorylation pathways (6Reinhart P.H. Chung S. Martin B.L. Brautigan D.L.

Physiol. 1994; 475: 241-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), suggesting that these channels are important cellular targets for various regulatory mechanisms. More recently, much interest has been generated by observations that cellular tyrosine kinases, in particular c Src, are able to modulate the activity of both ligand- and voltage-gated ion channels (16Moss S.J.

Such findings may now have broader implications, given that many G-protein-coupled receptors, which can regulate cellular excitability, are also now recognized to activate various tyrosine kinases as part of their signal transduction cascades (40Dikic I. Tokiwa G. Lev S. Courtneidge S.A. Schlessinger J. Nature. 1996; 383: 547-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (878) Google Scholar, 41Della Rocca G.J. van Biesen T. Daaka Y. Luttrell D.K. Luttrell L.M.

To determine whether BKCa channel activity could also be modulated by tyrosine phosphorylation, we utilized our transient transfection strategy to co-express the BKCa channel with cDNAs encoding active and catalytically inactive forms of the human c Src tyrosine kinase (42Brown M.T. Cooper J.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1287: 121-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (1082) Google Scholar). Site-directed mutagenesis was used to generate the inactive form of the enzyme by a Lys to Met substitution in the catalytic domain (see “Experimental Procedures”). The protein expression and tyrosine kinase activities of c Src transfected HEK 293 cells were then confirmed using two complementary approaches. Fig. 2 A shows a Western blot of total cell lysates probed with an antibody (4G10) to detect proteins containing phosphorylated tyrosine residues. In cells transfected with either the BKCa channel alone (first lane, BK alone) or BKCa channel plus the inactive form of c Src (second lane, BK + dead Src), similar levels of phosphotyrosine-containing proteins were observed. The major phosphoprotein with a molecular mass of ∼60 kDa in the second lane likely represents the inactive c Src, which still undergoes tyrosine phosphorylation in the intact cell. However, co-transfection of cDNAs encoding the BKCachannel and active c Src produced a large increase in the level of phosphotyrosine containing proteins (Fig. 2 A,third lane), indicating functional expression of c Src tyrosine kinase activity in situ. To directly confirm that both the active and inactive forms of the kinase were indeed expressed following transient transfection, a second Western blot of the same samples shown in Fig. 2 A was performed, using a monoclonal antibody against the c Srcprotein. In HEK 293 transfected with the m Slo cDNA alone, no signal was detected (Fig. 2 B, first lane). However, strong ∼60-kDa immunoreactive bands were readily observed in cells co-transfected with cDNAs for m Slo and either the active or inactive forms of c Src (Fig.2 B, second and third lanes). This result thus directly confirms the expression of c Src protein under the latter two transfection conditions. To provide further evidence that c Src was most likely responsible for the large increase in cellular phosphoproteins observed following co-transfection (Fig. 2 A, third lane), we directly measured the expressed c Src tyrosine kinase activity by first immunoprecipitating c Src and then performing an in vitro phosphorylation assay. In cells transfected with m Slo alone or m Slo plus the inactive form of c Src, very little protein kinase-dependent phosphorylation of the selective c Src peptide substrate cdc26–20 (43Cheng H.-C. Nishio H. Hatase O. Ralph S. Wang J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9248-9256Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was observed (Fig. 2 C). However, the immunoprecipitate from cells co-transfected with m Slo and active c Srcdemonstrated a robust, time-dependent phosphorylation of the substrate under the same assay conditions. This observation thus strongly suggests that the increased level of phosphotyrosine containing proteins detected in c Src transfected cells (Fig.2 A, third lane) is due primarily to the activity of the c Src tyrosine kinase itself. Fig. 3 shows macroscopic BKCachannel currents recorded in an excised membrane patch from a cell co-transfected with cDNAs for m Slo and active c Src (panels A–D) or m Slo and dead c Src (panels E–H).

Mutant enzymes were characterized with respect to their kinetic parameters using polygalacturonate as a substrate and with respect to their mode of action using oligogalacturonates of defined length (n = 3–6). In addition, the effect of the mutations on the hydrolysis of pectins with various degrees of esterification was studied. Based on the results obtained with enzymes N186E and D282K it was established that the substrate binds with the nonreducing end toward the N terminus of the enzyme. Asn186 is located at subsite −4, and Asp282 is located at subsite +2. The mutations D183N and M150Q, both located at subsite −2, affected catalysis, probably mediated via the sugar residue bound at subsite −1. Tyr291, located at subsite +1 and strictly conserved among endopolygalacturonases appeared indispensable for effective catalysis. The mutations E252A and Q288E, both located at subsite +2, showed only slight effects on catalysis and mode of action. Tyr326 is probably located at the imaginary subsite +3. The mutation Y326L affected the stability of the enzyme. For mutant E252A, an increased affinity for partially methylesterified substrates was recorded. Enzyme N186E displayed the opposite behavior; the specificity for completely demethylesterified regions of substrate, already high for the native enzyme, was increased.

Pectin consists of so-called “smooth” and “hairy” regions. The smooth region, or homogalacturonan part, consists of a backbone of α-d-1,4-linked galacturonic acid residues, which are in part methylated and can be acetylated. The hairy regions, known as rhamnogalacturonan, are characterized by stretches of 1,2-α-l-rhamnose-1,4-α-d-galacturonic acid dimers. To the rhamnose residues, l-arabinose andd-galactose can be attached. Due to its complex structure, many enzymes produced by saprophytic and plant pathogenic fungi and bacteria are necessary for a complete pectin degradation. For many microbial enzymes involved in pectin degradation, corresponding genes have been cloned and sequenced. In Aspergillus niger, a family of seven highly homologous genes encoding endopolygalacturonases (PGs)1 (EC 3.2.1.15), has been discovered (1Bussink H.J.D. Kester H.C.M. Visser J.

A. niger PGII is among the best characterized PGs (7Benen J.A.E. Kester H.C.M. Visser J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 259: 577-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). A provisional subsite map was obtained, and the total number of subsites was estimated to be seven (−5 to +2). Recently, the three-dimensional structures of Erwinia carotovora PG (9Pickersgill R. Smith D. Worboys K. Jenkins J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24660-24664Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar) and A. niger PGII were solved (10van Santen Y. Benen J.A.E.

In analogy to rhamnogalacturonase A (RGase A) from Aspergillus aculeatus(11Petersen T.N. Kauppinen S. Larsen S. Structure. 1997; 5: 533-544Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar), which also belongs to family 28, the PGs fold into a right-handed parallel β-helix. Initial site-directed mutagenesis studies identified residues critical for catalysis (12Armand S. Wagemaker M.J.M. Sanchez-Torres P. Kester H.C.M. van Santen Y. Dijkstra B.W. Visser J. Benen J.A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 691-696Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Three conserved aspartate residues (Asp180, Asp201, and Asp202 in PGII) appeared critical for catalysis. Asp180, with the assistance of Asp202, was proposed to act as a base to activate the bound water molecule, and Asp201 was tentatively identified as the general acid that protonates the leaving group (12Armand S. Wagemaker M.J.M. Sanchez-Torres P. Kester H.C.M. van Santen Y. Dijkstra B.W. Visser J. Benen J.A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 691-696Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Each of the A. niger PGs has different specific kinetic parameters on polygalacturonic acid and a specific mode of action (4Par̆enicová L. Benen J.A.E. Kester H.C.M. Visser J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 251: 72-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar,7Benen J.A.E. Kester H.C.M. Visser J. Eur. J.

To better understand the mode of action and specificity of PGII, we have initiated site-directed mutagenesis studies. Amino acid residues in the substrate binding cleft were replaced by residues as found in otherA. niger PGs, thus generating mutants M150Q, D183N, N186E, E252A, D282K, Q288E, Y291F, Y291L, and Y326L. The effect of the mutations on the mode of action, the kinetic parameters on polygalacturonate, and the performance on partially methylesterified substrates was studied.

A. niger NW188 (cspA1, pyrA6, leu-13,prtF28, goxC) was used for transformation (4Par̆enicová L. Benen J.A.E. Kester H.C.M. Visser J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 251: 72-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Plasmid pIM3710 (7Benen J.A.E. Kester H.C.M. Visser J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 259: 577-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar) containing a promoter-gene fusion between the constitutive pyruvate kinase A promoter (pkiA) (13de Graaff L.H. van den Broeck H.C. Visser J. Curr. Genet. 1992; 22: 21-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) and the polygalacturonase II gene was used as template for site-directed mutagenesis. This allows for the expression of (mutated) PGII during growth of the fungus on fructose, thus repressing the expression of most other pectinases including endogenous PGII. Plasmid pGW635 which contains the pyrA gene was used as selection marker for co-transformation of A. niger. Desired mutations were generated by polymerase chain reaction using the QuickChangeTM site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene Inc., La Jolla, CA). For each mutation introduced, thepki-pgaII gene fusion was sequenced entirely (4Par̆enicová L. Benen J.A.E. Kester H.C.M. Visser J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 251: 72-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) to establish the expected mutation and to check for undesired mutations. A. niger NW188 was transformed as described previously (14Kusters-van Someren M.A. Harmsen J.A.M. Kester H.C.M. Visser J. Curr. Genet. 1991; 20: 293-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar) using 1 μg of pGW635 and 20 μg of cotransforming pIM3710 or derivatives carrying the appropriate mutations. Transformants producing the highest amount of mutated PGII were selected as described before (4Par̆enicová L. Benen J.A.E. Kester H.C.M. Visser J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 251: 72-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Large scale cultivation and purification of the enzymes was carried out as outlined in Ref. 12Armand S. Wagemaker M.J.M.

This purification protocol ensures the separation of (mutant) PGII from the constitutively expressed PGA and PGB (8Par̆enicová L. Benen J.A.E. Kester H.C.M. Visser J. Biochem. J. 2000; 345: 637-644Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Enzyme concentrations were calculated from the molar extinction coefficient for PGII (7Benen J.A.E. Kester H.C.M. Visser J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 259: 577-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Determination of the specific activity, the kinetic parameters Vmax(app) andKm(app), the pH optimum, the product progression on polygalacturonic acid, and the mode of action on oligogalacturonates of defined length were done as outlined in Refs. 4Par̆enicová L.

For the determination of the specific activity and kinetic parameters, the following modification in the experimental procedure was done. Enzyme assays were performed immediately after dilution of the enzymes in the appropriate buffer. For the wild type enzyme, this resulted in a specific activity 2 times higher than reported earlier (7Benen J.A.E. Kester H.C.M. Visser J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 259: 577-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar,12Armand S. Wagemaker M.J.M. Sanchez-Torres P. Kester H.C.M. van Santen Y. Dijkstra B.W. Visser J. Benen J.A.E. J. Biol.

The effect of the degree of methylesterification of the substrates on the enzyme activity was investigated as described previously (7Benen J.A.E. Kester H.C.M. Visser J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 259: 577-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). The partially methylesterified substrates were provided by Danisco Ingredients (Brabrand, Denmark) and comprised three series. For the three series, citrus E81 pectin (a regular commercial pectin), with 81% methylesterification, served as the starting material. For one series, E81 was deesterified by a fungal (Aspergillus sp.) pectin methylesterase, resulting in a random removal of methylesters (F31, F43, F58, and F76, the number indicating the degree of esterification). For the second series, E81 was treated with a plant (orange) pectin methylesterase, yielding a blockwise distribution of methylesters (P41, P60, P70, and P76). The third series was obtained by alkaline treatment of E81, also resulting in a random distribution of methyl groups (B15, B34, and B43). Finally, a fully deesterified pectin, also obtained by saponification, called pga, served as a control. Determination of the temperature stability of the wild type enzyme and enzymes E252A and Y326L was performed by incubating the enzymes at 40 °C for 5, 10, 15, 30, 45, and 60 min followed by determination of the remaining activity in a standard assay. Residual specific activities, expressed in percentages, were calculated from the initial specific activity. Site-directed mutagenesis has successfully been carried out on different amino acids located in the substrate binding cleft of A. niger PGII, thus generating mutants M150Q, D183N, N186E, E252A, D282K, Q288E, Y291F, Y291L, and Y326L.A niger strains transformed with the appropriate plasmids were used for the overproduction of mutant enzymes. SDS-PAGE analysis followed by Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining was done to check the purity and integrity of the purified enzymes. Between 50 and 100 mg of each mutant enzyme were obtained. Mutated forms of PGII showed the same narrow pHversus activity profile as recorded for the wild type enzyme with an optimum at pH 4–4.2 (data not shown) (7Benen J.A.E. Kester H.C.M. Visser J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 259: 577-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). The specific activities for the wild type enzyme and the mutant enzymes are listed in Table I. For all mutants, except for Y326L, a decrease in the specific activity was observed particularly for the three mutants D183N, Y291F, and Y291L, which retained 12.8, 5, and 0.7% of the wild type activity, respectively (Table I), and which also showed the strongest effect on Km(app). Apart from the latter three mutants, specific activities of the other mutant enzymes are still high, indicating that the mutations only slightly affected catalysis. Indeed, the parameterk0/Km(app), reflecting the enzyme's efficiency, differed only slightly from the wild type enzyme for most of mutants. Please note the dimension of this parameter, which is due to the expression of the substrate concentration in mg·ml−1 rather than m.Table ISpecific activities and kinetics parameters for wild type and mutated forms of PGIISpecific activityVmax(app)Km(app)k0/KmΔΔGunits · mg−1units · mg−1mg · ml−1ml · mg−1 · s−1(×103)kJ · mol−1Wild type390040000.1515.510M150Q150017000.42.474.4D183N5005000.50.587.9N186E310030000.53.493.6E252A290030000.62.914.0D282K240025000.34.852.8Q288E2400260011.515.6Y291L30351.90.01217.5Y291F2002501.80.08112.6Y326L400042000.212.20.6Specific activities and kinetic constants of wild type and mutated PGII were determined in 50 mm sodium acetate buffer, pH 4.2, at 30 °C.

For two mutants, E252A and Y326L, product progression on polygalacturonic acid was comparable with that of the wild type. The accumulation of oligomers with a degree of polymerization of ≥4 occurs during the first stages of hydrolysis, followed by a conversion of these longer oligomers into (GalpA)3, (GalpA)2, and (GalpA)1 (7Benen J.A.E. Kester H.C.M. Visser J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 259: 577-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). For the mutants M150Q, D183N, N186E, D282K, Q288E, Y291F, and Y291L, clear differences compared with the product formation curves of PGII were observed. For comparison, product progression curves for selected mutants N186E and Q288E are shown in Fig. 1. After prolonged hydrolysis, the main products formed by M150Q, D183N, Q288E, Y291L, and Y291F are (GalpA)2 and (GalpA)4, whereas mutant D282K produced high levels of (GalpA)1 and (GalpA)4. Mutant N186E accumulated relatively high amounts of (GalpA)3. Ultimately, all mutants degraded (GalpA)4 into (GalpA)1 and (GalpA)3. The products formed from oligogalacturonates by the individual mutants and the respective hydrolysis rates were studied for substrates with a degree of polymerization of 3–6 (TablesII andIII). For the wild type enzyme, the concentrations at which the oligomers were used is well above theKm of all the substrates, except for (GalpA)3 (7Benen J.A.E. Kester H.C.M. Visser J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 259: 577-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). PGII wild type and mutants only hydrolyzed the first glycosidic bond from the reducing end of (GalpA)3 and (GalpA)4, demonstrating the formation of only one productive complex with these substrates (7Benen J.A.E. Kester H.C.M. Visser J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 259: 577-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar) (Table III). For (GalpA)5 and (GalpA)6, two and three productive binding modes were recorded, respectively, although for some mutant enzymes the bond cleavage frequencies differed from the wild type enzyme with respect to (GalpA)5 and (GalpA)6hydrolysis (Table II). For mutants E252A and Y326L, the observed BCFs for the penta- and hexamer were comparable with those of the wild type enzyme. Mutants M150Q, D183N, Q288E, Y291F, and Y291L preferred cleavage of the second glycosidic bond from the reducing end on (GalpA)5 and (GalpA)6(Table II). Enzyme D282K showed a preference for the first glycosidic bond on (GalpA)5, and on (GalpA)6 the production of dimers decreased in favor of the formation of monomers and trimers (Table II). Yet another preference was observed for enzyme N186E, where cleavage of the third glycosidic linkage of (GalpA)6 was most prominently changed and which showed the highest frequency for the second bond of (GalpA)5.Table IIBond cleavage frequencies on (GalpA)6 and (GalpA)5 for wild type and mutated forms of PGIIEnzyme(GalpA)6 cleavage frequenciesRateG–G–G–G–G–G%%%units · mg−1Wild type85735552M150Q87814258D183N117514250N186E315316770E252A106030700D282K164242500Q288E96823561Y291L1075155Y291F10781278Y326L115732650(GalpA)5 cleavage frequenciesG–G–G–G–GWild type3268663M150Q4258134D183N514980N186E6931611E252A3070718D282K1684380Q288E3763502Y291L43571.3Y291F445629Y326L30707020.5 mm oligogalacturonates were incubated with wild type or mutated PGII in 0.5 ml of 50 mm sodium acetate buffer, pH 4.2, at 30 °C.

As observed with the polymer substrate, for the mutant enzymes the rates of hydrolysis of the oligomers (n = 5 or 6) were generally lower than observed for the wild type enzyme (Table II), with the exception of mutants N186E, E252A, and Y326L. For the latter three mutants, the rates of hydrolysis of (GalpA)6 and (GalpA)5 were equal to or higher than those of the wild type. Substrates with various degrees and distributions of methylesterification were used to investigate the effect of the mutations located in the substrate binding cleft on the tolerance of methylesterification of the substrate. Of all A. nigerpolygalacturonases, PGII is the least tolerant for methylesterified substrates (7Benen J.A.E. Kester H.C.M. Visser J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 259: 577-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 8Par̆enicová L. Benen J.A.E. Kester H.C.M. Visser J. Biochem. J. 2000; 345: 637-644Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). PGI was included in this study to serve as reference enzyme with a higher tolerance for methylesterification of the substrate than PGII (7Benen J.A.E. Kester H.C.M. Visser J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 259: 577-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Among all mutated forms of PGII tested, only enzymes N186E and E252A showed a clear difference compared with the wild type enzyme. Therefore, only the data for these mutants are listed in Table IV. The data clearly demonstrate the low tolerance for methylesterified substrates by PGII compared with PGI and mutant E252A. Mutant N186E shows an even lower tolerance of methylesterification of the substrate than recorded for the wild type enzyme. Furthermore, the distribution of the methyl groups also resulted in different relative activities. Comparison of the data for PGII in this respect shows that this enzyme strongly prefers blocks of deesterified pectin (P substrate). This preference is even more pronounced for mutant N186E. For PGI and enzyme E252A, this effect is less strong. Above a 60% degree of esterification, none of the enzymes can discriminate between F and P substrates.Table IVDegradation of pectin with different degree of methylesterification by PGII, PGI, and PGII mutants E252A and N186ESubstrateResidual activityPGIIPGIN186EE252A%%%%pga100100100100B15621046885F3159844685B3457844878P4184994794F4348702873B4348632675P6041831966F5824531743P701354514F691347710P76929611F761232512E8171526Specific activities were determined during initial linear stages of the reaction in 50 mm sodium acetate, pH 4.2, at 30 °C using 2.5 mg · ml−1 substrate.

A completely deesterified pectin called pga, prepared from E81, was used as standard substrate. The residual activity was calculated from the specific activity on pga.

Routinely, a PG assay is carried out at 30 °C, the optimal temperature for growth of A. niger. However, A. niger polygalacturonases are generally stable at a temperature of 45–50 °C, 2H. C. M. Kester, unpublished results. and PGE, which was tested in this respect, appeared to be 4-fold more active at 60 °C than at 30 °C (4Par̆enicová L. Benen J.A.E. Kester H.C.M. Visser J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 251: 72-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Among the mutants prepared for this study, Y326L was very sensitive to higher temperature. A relatively quick enzyme inactivation was observed even at 30 °C (data not shown). Fig. 2 shows the inactivation profile of enzyme Y326L and of wild type enzyme at 40 °C. Mutant E252A was included in this study as a second control. The stability of mutant E252A was the same as found for the wild type enzyme (data not shown). Whereas PGII is stable for at least 1 h at 40 °C, the specific activity of mutant Y326L decreased, demonstrating a higher temperature instability (Fig. 2). Previously we have described the effect of site-directed mutagenesis of strictly conserved residues among polygalacturonases (12Armand S. Wagemaker M.J.M. Sanchez-Torres P.

That particular study identified the catalytic amino acids. In the present report, we have extended our study to identify residues involved in the substrate binding and to locate the subsites in the substrate binding cleft of the recently solved PGII three-dimensional structure (10van Santen Y. Benen J.A.E. Schröter K.H. Kalk K.H. Armand S. Visser J. Dijkstra B.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30474-30480Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar) (the Protein Data Bank code for the A. nigerPGII three-dimensional structure is 1CZF). The following residues were subjected to mutagenesis: Met150, Asp183, Asn186, Glu252, Asp282, Gln288, Tyr291, and Tyr326 (see Fig. 3). Of those, Asp183, Tyr291, and Tyr326 are conserved among all six A. niger endopolygalacturonases, viz. PGI, PGII, PGA, PGB, PGC, and PGE. Asp282 is conserved between five of the six enzymes. In PGB, a lysine is present at position 282. Glu252, present in PGII and PGA, is replaced by a noncharged (Gln) or apolar amino acid (Ala) in the other PGs. Asn186 is replaced by charged residues in the other PGs, except for PGB, where a Gln is found at this position. Met150 and Gln288 are present only in PGII. In the other A. niger polygalacturonases, Met150 is replaced by Gln, and Gln288 is replaced by Glu. Thus, the following mutants were prepared and biochemically characterized: M150Q, D183N, N186E, E252A, D282K, Q288E, Y291L, Y291L, and Y326L. The formation of a productive hydrolytic complex between an enzyme and its substrate will result in the release of specific products. Modification of the product distribution by mutant enzymes is thus a direct reflection of changes in the productive binding modes compared with those observed for the wild type enzyme (15Allen J.D. Thoma J.A. Biochem. J. 1976; 159: 105-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 16Thoma J.A. Brothers C. Spradlin J. Biochemistry. 1970; 9: 1768-1775Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 17Thoma J.A. Rao G.V.K. Brothers C. Spradlin J. J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 5621-5635Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and hence a result of changes of the subsite affinities. Based on the homology with rhamnogalacturonase, we have previously suggested the location of subsites −1 and +1 (12Armand S. Wagemaker M.J.M. Sanchez-Torres P. Kester H.C.M. van Santen Y. Dijkstra B.W. Visser J. Benen J.A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 691-696Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) (see Scheme FS1). This implies that the substrate will bind with the reducing end directed toward the C terminus of the enzyme. Data obtained for mutants N186E and D282K now confirm this. The location of Asn186and Asp282 is depicted in Fig. 3. The distance of Asn186 and Asp282 from the active site is such that they would form part of subsites −3 or −4 (Asn186) and +2 or +3 (Asp282). For mutant N186E, the changes in the BCFs on (GalpA)6 and (GalpA)5 indicate a decreased affinity at subsite −4 or an increased affinity at subsite −3. The increased rate on (GalpA)4 compared with the native enzyme (Table III) indicates a reduction of the formation of non-productive complexes binding from subsites −4 to −1. This can only result from a decreased affinity at subsite −4. Thus, Asn186 is located at subsite −4. For (GalpA)3 hydrolysis, a decreased rate was recorded (Table III), which at present cannot be satisfactory explained. For Asp282, the reasoning is along the same lines. The observed changes in BCFs (the preferred bond hydrolyzed changing from the second to the first bond counting from the reducing end on (GalpA)5 and the reduced cleavage of the second linkage of (GalpA)6 with concomitant increased cleavage at the first and the third glycosidic bond) demonstrate that in enzyme D282K the affinity at subsite +2 is reduced. It is therefore concluded that Asp282 is located at subsite +2. This is corroborated by the fact that the transition state energy difference between the wild type and mutant calculated as 2.8 kJ·mol−1 correlates well with the provisional binding energy as calculated for subsite +2 (−2.8 kJ·mol−1) (7Benen J.A.E. Kester H.C.M. Visser J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 259: 577-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Based on the PGII three-dimensional structure (10van Santen Y. Benen J.A.E. Schröter K.H. Kalk K.H. Armand S. Visser J. Dijkstra B.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30474-30480Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar), Tyr291 should be located at or close to subsite +1. The ΔG decrease by 12.6 kJ·mol−1 upon removal of the phenolic function (Y291F) demonstrates an important role for the hydroxyl function in catalysis. The ΔG difference being in the order of an ionogenic bond suggests that Tyr291 is deprotonated during catalysis. Furthermore, the aromatic part also contributes to the stabilization of the substrate at subsite +1 as can be inferred from the additional 4.9 kJ·mol−1ΔG loss for enzyme Y291L. The BCFs for mutants Y291F and Y291L, increased cleavage at the second glycosidic bond on (GalpA)5 and (GalpA)6, are commensurate with the expected effect of mutagenizing residues at subsites −1 and +1 as we outlined previously (12Armand S. Wagemaker M.J.M. Sanchez-Torres P. Kester H.C.M. van Santen Y. Dijkstra B.W. Visser J. Benen J.A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 691-696Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). As already discussed above, Asp282 is located at subsite +2. On the opposite side of the substrate binding cleft, Gln288 is found. Therefore, Gln288 should be part of subsite +2 as well. The BCFs on (GalpA)5 and (GalpA)6 for mutant Q288E indicate a slight increase of affinity at subsite +2. However, in view of the decreased rates on (GalpA)4 and (GalpA)3, where the productive complexes do not bind at subsite +2, it has to be concluded that the newly engineered Glu also interacts with subsite +1. The carboxylate function of the substrate at subsite +1 is most likely oriented toward the side of the cleft where Gln288 is located, since Arg256, on the same side of the cleft, was proposed to interact via an ionogenic interaction with the substrate at subsite +1 (12Armand S. Wagemaker M.J.M. Sanchez-Torres P. Kester H.C.M. van Santen Y. Dijkstra B.W. Visser J. Benen J.A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 691-696Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). This is also supported by the fact that of the catalytically competent mutant enzymes, for Q288E the highestKm and lowest efficiency were calculated. Glu252, located at subsite +1/+2, according to the structure, apparently has a minor role in the binding of the unmethylesterified substrate, since the effect on catalysis and BCFs of enzyme E252A was small compared with the wild type enzyme. However, the mutant enzyme appeared more tolerant for methylesterified substrates, and the results obtained suggest a location at subsite +2. This will be discussed below. In an earlier study concerning the number and the affinity of the subsites of PGII (7Benen J.A.E. Kester H.C.M. Visser J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 259: 577-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar), it was tentatively concluded that subsite +3 was imaginary. To test this, Tyr283 and Tyr326, which based on the three-dimensional structure are residues most likely located at subsite +3, were mutagenized. Enzyme Y326L showed consistently a slightly increased rate on the polymeric substrate as well as on all oligomers used except for (GalpA)4, where the rate was almost equal. BCFs of mutant Y326L changed minimally compared with the native enzyme. It is therefore concluded that Tyr326 is not involved in substrate binding and thus may be part of the imaginary site. Of all of the mutants prepared in this study, enzyme Y326L had the least effect on all characteristics studied except for a decreased temperature stability. The origin of the decreased temperature stability in enzyme Y326L is most likely to be found in the loss of the stacking of Tyr326 with Tyr283. Numerous attempts to obtain an A. niger transformant producing enzyme Y283L were unsuccessful, probably as a result of even further increased instability of this particular mutant enzyme. The two tyrosines, located on two adjacent rungs of the parallel β-helix, may be important for the enzyme integrity, probably by maintaining the proper enzyme conformation, rather than interacting with the substrate. The closer the residues are to the catalytic site, the less clear cut the result will be with regard to the bond cleavage frequencies, since all of the substrates used cover subsites −2 to +1 in their productive complexes. Since subsite −2 should help to stabilize the distorted sugar ring at subsite −1, changes in affinity at subsite −2 will have a similar effect as mutations at subsite −1, which we discussed previously (12Armand S. Wagemaker M.J.M. Sanchez-Torres P. Kester H.C.M. van Santen Y. Dijkstra B.W. Visser J. Benen J.A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 691-696Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Therefore, mutations at subsite −2 also result in an increased cleavage of the second glycosidic linkage as a result of invoking subsite +2 to compensate for the binding energy lost at −2. Met150 and Asp183 are most likely located at subsite −2 or at the junction of −2 and −1. For enzymes M150Q and D183N, the BCFs show the expected shift. In the three-dimensional structure, the two carboxylate oxygen atoms of Asp183 are on average only 3.6 Å away from the carboxylate oxygen atoms of Asp180, the residue that activates the nucleophile with the assistance of Asp202. Thus, Asp183 may be important to maintain the proper ionization state of Asp180to play its water-activating role in catalysis. Met150 was replaced by Gln, a residue present at this position in all otherA. niger PGs. Among these enzymes are those that have activities only slightly lower than PGII, viz. PGA and PGB (8Par̆enicová L. Benen J.A.E. Kester H.C.M. Visser J. Biochem. J. 2000; 345: 637-644Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Due to the quite significant decrease in activity andVmax, it has to be concluded that Met150 plays a unique and important role in PGII. The electrostatic potential generated by the sulfur atom may well be important for the binding of the substrate. By mutagenesis of Glu252 into Ala, the residue present in PGI at this position, the tolerance of enzyme E252A for partially methylesterified substrates with a moderate degree of esterification became almost equal to that of PGI (Table IV). PGI, like PGII, requires a carboxylate at subsite +1 (18Kester H.C.M. Magaud D. Roy C. Anker D. Doutheau A. Shevchik V. Hugouvieux-Cotte-Pattat N. Benen J.A.E. Visser J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 346: 469-474Google Scholar, 19Körner R. Limberg G. Christensen T.M.I.E. Mikkelsen J.D. Roepstorff P. Anal. Chem. 1999; 71: 1421-1427Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). The difference in tolerance between PGII and enzyme E252A and PGI can therefore not be due to interaction at subsite +1. This interaction should rather occur at subsite +2 (see “Residues at Subsite +2′”). Since pectic substrates constitute a 2- or 3-helix and the GalpA residue at subsite +1 is likely to bind with its carboxylate toward Arg256, the increased tolerance of mutant E252A is plausible, as a nonpolar small residue like Ala at subsite +2, at the opposite side of the cleft compared with Arg256, provides the necessary space for the methylesterified substrate, as well as an increased hydrophobicity of the pocket. Enzyme N186E was the second mutant with altered tolerance for partially methylesterified substrates. However, this enzyme displayed opposite characteristics compared with mutant E252A. Although most A. niger PGs have Glu at position 186, none of them displays the mode of action, increased release of dimers on (GalpA)5, and increased release of trimers on (GalpA)6 and the strong bias for unmethylesterified substrate as seen for mutant N186E. Apparently, for PGII the actual make-up of the other subsites is such that the behavior of enzyme N186E does not mimic any other A. niger PG. From the decreased affinity at subsite −4 and the decreased tolerance for methylesterified substrate for enzyme N186E, it has to be concluded that Glu186 interacts with the substrate via the carboxylic function, probably via a water molecule. The definite assignment of contacts between the enzyme and the substrate has to await the elucidation of the three-dimensional structure of the enzyme-substrate complex.

Given the functional similarity of mammalian vitamin K-dependent carboxylases and the vitamin K-dependent carboxylase fromConus textile, a marine invertebrate, we hypothesized that structurally conserved regions would identify sequences critical to this common functionality. Furthermore, we examined the diversity of animal species that maintain vitamin K-dependent carboxylation to generate γ-carboxyglutamic acid. We have cloned carboxylase homologs in full-length or partial form from the beluga whale (Delphinapterus leucas), toadfish (Opsanus tau), chicken (Gallus gallus), hagfish (Myxine glutinosa), horseshoe crab (Limulus polyphemus), and cone snail (Conus textile) to compare these structures to the known bovine, human, rat, and mouse cDNA sequences. Comparison of the predicted amino acid sequences identified a nearly perfectly conserved 38-amino acid residue region in all of these putative carboxylases. In addition, this amino acid motif is also present in theDrosophila genome and identified a Drosophilahomolog of the γ-carboxylase.

This reaction is catalyzed by the vitamin K-dependent γ-glutamyl carboxylase in a reaction that requires reduced vitamin K, molecular oxygen, carbon dioxide, and a glutamate-containing peptide substrate.

Since the discovery in 1974 of γ-carboxyglutamic acid in prothrombin, a vitamin K-dependent blood coagulation protein (5Stenflo J. Fernlund P. Egan W. Roepstorff P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Although initial reports identified γ-carboxyglutamic acid convincingly in a number of mammalian proteins that included all of the vitamin K-dependent blood coagulation proteins (7Bucher D.

Chem. 1977; 252: 2178-2181Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The definitive finding of γ-carboxyglutamic acid in the conotoxins of the marine cone snail demonstrated for the first time the presence of γ-carboxyglutamic acid in invertebrates (13McIntosh J.M. Olivera B.M. Cruz L.J. Gray W.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 14343-14346Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To assess the role of γ-carboxyglutamic acid and the importance of vitamin K in animal phyla, we have studied vitamin K-dependent carboxylation in the cone snail and compared this process to γ-carboxylation in mammalian systems. We and others have established numerous common features between mammalian carboxylation and cone snail carboxylation: 1) both have absolute requirements for vitamin K or a vitamin K-like cofactor (14Hauschka P.V. Mullen E.A. Hintsch G. Jazwinski S. Suttie J.W. Current Advances in Vitamin K Research. Elsevier Science Publishing Co., Inc., New York1988: 237-243Google Scholar, 15Stanley T.B. Stafford D.W.

The carboxylation recognition sites of carboxylase substrates direct carboxylation with carboxylase from both the bovine and cone snail species, although optimal carboxylation is observed in allotypic systems. The apparent functional similarity of the bovine and Conus vitamin K-dependent carboxylase led us to hypothesize that regions important to unique function would be highly conserved. To identify such highly conserved regions and establish useful molecular probes for the presence of the carboxylase gene in diverse animal species, we have determined the complete or partial carboxylase cDNA sequences from a variety of vertebrate and invertebrate species. Here, we describe the full-length clones of the beluga whale (Delphinapterus leucas) and toadfish (Opsanus tau) carboxylases. Using probes based upon the regions of sequence identity between the toadfish carboxylase sequence and the sequences of the mammalian carboxylases, we have isolated partial clones of the vitamin K-dependent carboxylase genes from the cone snail (Conus textile), the hagfish (Myxine glutinosa), chicken (Gallus gallus), and horseshoe crab (Limulus polyphemus) and established a 38-residue region of the carboxylase that is nearly perfectly conserved. These studies indicate that the vitamin K-dependent biosynthesis of γ-carboxyglutamic acid is a highly conserved function in the animal kingdom. mRNA from Beluga whale liver, toadfish liver, hagfish liver, and horseshoe crab hepatopancreas were the generous gift of Dr. N. Cornell at the Marine Biological Laboratory (Woods Hole, MA). Horseshoe crab blood was provided by Dr. N. Wainwright (Marine Biological Laboratory). The chicken liver cDNA library was purchased from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA). Live cone snails were obtained from Fiji and imported into the United States under the jurisdiction of the United States Fish and Wildlife Service. TRIzol reagent, Superscript reverse transcriptase, and synthetic oligonucleotide primers were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. RACE2 kits and Advantage cDNA polymerase mix were obtained fromCLONTECH (Palo Alto, CA). TOPO TA cloning and FastTrack mRNA purification systems were purchased from Invitrogen (Carlsbad, CA). Reagents for DNA purification were from Qiagen (Santa Clarita, CA). Amplitaq Gold polymerase was purchased from PE Applied Biosystems (Foster City, CA). All other reagents were of highest grade available. RNA was extracted from frozen cone snail (C. textile) venom ducts with TRIzol reagent, and poly(A)† RNA was isolated with oligo(dT) cellulose (FastTrack) according to the manufacturer's recommended protocols. Horseshoe crab blood was collected and immediately centrifuged to pellet cells. RNA was extracted and poly(A)+ RNA purified using the FastTrack system. First strand cDNA synthesis was performed with Superscript reverse transcriptase according to the manufacturer's protocol. cDNA was amplified with Amplitaq Gold DNA polymerase in Geneamp buffer (PE Biosystems) using 1 μm degenerate primers (Table I) in a PerkinElmer Life Sciences 9700 thermocycler. Cycling conditions were as follows: 95 °C, 9-min preactivation, five cycles each at annealing temperatures of 60, 55, and 50 °C and 25 cycles at an annealing temperature of 45 °C with extension times at 72 °C increasing 2 s/cycle starting from 1 min 30 s.Table IOligonucleotide primers used in PCR amplificationPrimerSequenceCarboxylase degenerate primer 1 1-aCode for degenerate nucleotide positions: R = A + G, Y = C + T; I = deoxyinosine.ACICARGGITAYAAYAAYTGGCarboxylase degenerate primer 2 1-aCode for degenerate nucleotide positions: R = A + G, Y = C + T; I = deoxyinosine.CATRTCIGCRTGRTCYTTCCAWhale gene-specific primer 1GGTCCTTCCAACGCCGGCTCTGTGWhale gene-specific primer 2AGGGGTACAACAACTGGACAAACGGFish gene-specific primer 1GGTCTTTCCAACGACGGCTTTGTGFish gene-specific primer 2AAGGGTACAACAACTGGACCAACGGC1-a Code for degenerate nucleotide positions: R = A + G, Y = C + T; I = deoxyinosine. Open table in a new tab cDNAs that produced no amplification product following PCR with degenerate primers were reamplified using nondegenerate nested primers based upon the toadfish DNA sequence (Table I, fish gene-specific primers). For the nested reaction, 2 μl of the first PCR reaction was used as template with 0.2 μm nondegenerate primers. Cycling conditions were identical to those used in the first reaction. SMART RACE technology (CLONTECH) was used to obtain full-length cDNA sequence. First strand cDNA was synthesized with Superscript reverse transcriptase, and adaptor sequences were incorporated via oligonucleotide primers during this step. The resulting cDNA preparations were used as templates in PCR reactions containing 0.2 μm gene-specific primer (see Table I) and universal primer mix (CLONTECH). cDNA was amplified with Advantage cDNA polymerase mix in a PerkinElmer Life Sciences thermocycler according to the manufacturer's recommended protocols. Single-stranded overhangs generated by the polymerase during PCR were used to clone PCR products into vector pCR2.1-TOPO. The ligation reactions were used to transform competent TOP10 E. coli by heat shock. Transformants were selected on LB agar containing 50 mg/ml kanamycin and containing 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl β-d-galactopyranoside for blue/white screening. White colonies were analyzed by PCR and/or restriction enzyme digest for inserts. Plasmid DNA was extracted from positive clones by alkaline lysis column minipreps (Qiagen). DNA was sequenced on an Applied Biosystems 373 DNA sequencer. Microsomes were prepared from hagfish liver using standard techniques (17Ulrich M.M.W. Furie B. Jacobs M. Vermeer C. Furie B.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 9697-9702Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Carboxylase activity was assayed as the incorporation of14CO2 into the synthetic peptide FLEEL, as described previously (17Ulrich M.M.W. Furie B. Jacobs M. Vermeer C. Furie B.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 9697-9702Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Nondegenerate primers based on bovine and rat carboxylase nucleotide sequences and degenerate primers derived from predicted amino acid sequences of the most highly conserved regions of the published mammalian carboxylases were used in PCR reactions with cDNA templates derived from toadfish liver and whale liver mRNA. Only a single set of degenerate primers yielded a specific amplification product of the predicted size from both species (TableI). The 180-base pair fragments from both species were cloned into pCR2.1-TOPO and the insert sequenced. The predicted amino acid sequences were 94 and 100% identical to the bovine sequence for toadfish and whale clones, respectively. Gene-specific primers (Table I) were designed for each species and used to amplify 5′- and 3′-flanking regions by RACE PCR. RACE products were cloned and sequenced, and full-length cDNA sequences assembled. The whale cDNA contains an open reading frame of 2274 nucleotides (GenBankTM accession number AF278713) encoding a predicted protein of 758 amino acids (Fig.1). The predicted full-length amino acid sequence is 92% identical to the human sequence and 94% identical to the bovine sequence. This marked similarity among these mammalian vitamin K-dependent carboxylases precluded identification of regions of functional importance, since there were few sequence differences among the five carboxylases. The toadfish cDNA contains an open reading frame of 2286 nucleotides (GenBankTMaccession number AF278714) encoding a predicted protein of 762 amino acids (Fig. 1). The deduced toadfish translation product has five insertions relative to the mammalian sequences, one of 7 amino acids, three of 2 amino acids and one of 1 amino acid, one deletion of 2 amino acids and a 9 amino acid truncation, relative to the mammalian sequences. Analysis of alignments of the predicted protein products of these full-length cDNAs and the published carboxylase sequences revealed extremely high conservation of the central region of the protein. One-hundred twenty-four of the 131 amino acids between residues 365 and 496 (bovine numbering) are identical or highly conserved in all the mammalian and the single fish species. Indeed, residues 365–418 are conserved, and residues 384–415 are identical (Fig. 1). Although the mammalian carboxylase sequences are near perfectly conserved, there are 105 residues of 758 where the toadfish amino acid disrupts conserved residues at the same position for bovine, human, rat, mouse, and whale carboxylases. Given the extremely high conservation of the mammalian carboxylases, we relied heavily on the fish carboxylase to indicate regions that might be conserved across animal phyla and focused on the central region of sequence identity as a strategy for exploring nonvertebrate carboxylases. We elected to evaluate hagfish as a primitive fish (hemichordata) that predates the chordates phylogenetically and to evaluate Conus, since we and others have studied γ-carboxyglutamic acid and the vitamin K-dependent carboxylase in this invertebrate (14Hauschka P.V.

Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 16528-16534Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Using the degenerate primers for the highly conserved amino acid motif (Table I), cDNA from chicken liver was PCR amplified. The sequence of the resulting DNA fragment predicted a translation product 92% identical to the corresponding region of the bovine carboxylase. No product was observed after primary amplification with cDNA templates from hagfish liver, cone snail venom duct, and horseshoe crab hepatopancreas or blood using degenerate primers. However, a product of the correct predicted size was obtained for each species in a secondary PCR reaction using nested primers based on the toadfish DNA sequence (Table I; fish gene-specific primers) and the reaction mixture from the primary amplification. The alignment of these partial carboxylase sequences, from residues 384 to 443 using the bovine numbering, is shown in Fig. 2. This region is very highly conserved across these disparate vertebrate and invertebrate species. From residues 393 to 432, there are only 3 nonconservative substitutions among the bovine, chicken, toadfish, hagfish, cone snail, and horseshoecrab sequences. At residue 407, the chicken and hagfish carboxylases have a phenylalanine, while the other species studied have a serine. At residue 419, chicken and hagfish carboxylases have a leucine, the cone snail carboxylase has a glutamine, and other species have a basic amino acid, either lysine or arginine. At residue 427, the chicken and hagfish carboxylases have a lysine while the other species studied have an asparagine. Carboxylase enzyme activity has been demonstrated in the chicken (23Shah D.H. Suttie J.W. Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 1979; 161: 498-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) and the cone snail (14Hauschka P.V. Mullen E.A. Hintsch G. Jazwinski S. Suttie J.W. Current Advances in Vitamin K Research. Elsevier Science Publishing Co., Inc., New York1988: 237-243Google Scholar, 15Stanley T.B. Stafford D.W. Olivera B.M. Bandyopadhyay P.K. FEBS Lett. 1997; 407: 85-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), and there is a single report of γ-carboxyglutamic acid in the horseshoe crab (12Tai J.Y. Liu T.-Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 2178-2181Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To confirm the presence of carboxylase activity in hagfish, where it has not previously been observed,in vitro carboxylation assays were performed. Microsomes were prepared from hagfish liver and assayed for vitamin K-dependent incorporation of 14CO2into the synthetic carboxylase substrate Phe-Leu-Glu-Glu-Leu. In the presence of reduced vitamin K, the carboxylase in hagfish microsomes incorporated 2219 cpm of 14CO2 into FLEEL. When proPT18, an 18-residue peptide based upon the sequence of the propeptide of prothrombin, is included in the reaction mixture, 10,064 cpm of 14CO2 were incorporated into FLEEL-a stimulation of about 5-fold. ProPT18 also stimulates carboxylation of FLEEL by mammalian carboxylases (24Furie B. Bouchard B. Furie B.C. Blood. 1999; 93: 1798-1808Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the absence of vitamin K, no carboxylation was detected with the hagfish microsomes, indicating that the hagfish microsomes contain a carboxylase activity that is dependent upon the presence of vitamin K. Although γ-carboxyglutamic acid has been found in vertebrates and a single invertebrate, the marine snail of the genusConus, we have been unable to clone the Conuscarboxylase cDNA using DNA probes derived from the bovine carboxylase or rat carboxylase cDNA. It would appear that the vitamin K-dependent carboxylase, albeit very well conserved in mammals, does not have sufficient DNA sequence similarity to allow identification of the carboxylase in tested invertebrate species. To explore structure-function relationships in an enzyme that has no significant homology to other proteins, we predicted that direct comparison of the amino acid sequences of functionally homologous carboxylases derived from various species across animal phyla would allow identification of conserved amino acid sequences that are critical for the function of this enzyme. All vitamin K-dependent carboxylases should contain an active site for carboxylase activity, an active site for epoxidase activity, a vitamin K binding site, and a binding site for the carboxylation recognition site on the substrate (24Furie B. Bouchard B. Furie B.C. Blood. 1999; 93: 1798-1808Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To this end, we obtained the full-length clones of the beluga whale carboxylase and the toadfish carboxylase to distinguish variable regions from well conserved regions, since the human, bovine, mouse, and rat carboxylase sequences are so similar. Comparison of the toadfish carboxylase sequence and the bovine carboxylase sequence revealed a single region, from 384 to 415 consisting of 32 amino acids that share the same sequence. We speculate that this may be a critical sequence for the function of this enzyme and that all vertebrate and invertebrate vitamin K-dependent carboxylases would share this sequence. Using probes based upon the toadfish cDNA, we were able to isolate cDNA encoding this highly conserved region in the carboxylases derived from chicken, hagfish, cone snail, and horseshoe crab. These results indicate that the vitamin K-dependent carboxylase is broadly distributed across animal phyla, and this motif is very highly conserved in this enzyme regardless of species of origin. Mapping of the vitamin K-dependent carboxylase to identify functional regions has revealed several general insights, some consistent with the identification of a functionally important motif within the central region of the enzyme. Roth (25Roth D.A. Whirl M.L. Velazquez-Estades L.J. Walsh C. Furie B. Furie B.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5305-5311Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) demonstrated that truncation of 46 amino acids at the C terminus of bovine carboxylase did not interfere with enzymatic function in vitro, whereas truncation of 82 residues from the C terminus interfered with epoxidation but not propeptide binding or glutamate binding. A naturally occurring carboxylase mutation in a patient with deficiency of the vitamin K-dependent carboxylase occurs at leucine 394 (26Brenner B. Sanchez-Vega B. Wu S.-M. Lanir N. Stafford D.W. Solera J. Blood. 1998; 92: 4554-4559Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), within the most conserved region of the motif that we have identified. This residue is highly conserved, but it is not known how this mutation interferes with enzymatic activity. Modified scanning mutagenesis of bovine carboxylase included mutation of arginine 406 to alanine and histidine 408 to alanine (27Sugiura I. Furie B. Walsh C.T. Furie B.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17837-17844Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Expression of this double mutant in CHO cells was characterized by a carboxylase activity with a requirement for high propeptide concentrations for stimulation of carboxylation of FLEEL, suggesting defects in the propeptide binding site. To confirm the presence of the vitamin K-dependent carboxylase in hemichordates, we assayed hagfish liver. Hagfish exhibited carboxylase activity that was dependent upon the presence of vitamin K. Because the propeptide of both low K mmammalian carboxylase substrates and Conus carboxylase substrates are required for efficient carboxylation at low substrate concentration, and because the carboxylation recognition site in these propeptides differs (18Bandyopadhyay P.K.

Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 14660-14666Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), we used FLEEL as a highK m generic substrate for these assays. Bovine vitamin K-dependent carboxylase has a K min the millimolar range with FLEEL. Microsomal preparations from hagfish demonstrate the carboxylation of FLEEL via the incorporation of CO2. However, the hepatopancreas preparation from horseshoe crab was highly atypical of microsomal preparations and contained large amounts of lipid. On this basis, the carboxylase assay of this material was considered unreliable. We have not evaluated any of these nonvertebrate carboxylases using mammalian substrates containing propeptides, but we speculate that these would not be lowK m substrates. Using a consensus sequence derived from alignment of the cDNA sequences reported here, the nonredundant nucleotide data base was searched with the tBLASTn program. The only significant match obtained, other than the published mammalian carboxylase cDNAs, was a small stretch of Drosophila melanogaster genomic sequence (GenBankTM accession number AC005557). Genefinder analysis of this clone revealed a putative gene consisting of 3 exons and encoding a 629-amino acid-long sequence with 44% identity to the human carboxylase. Alignment analyses revealed that the most highly conserved region (corresponding to residues 384–443 of the bovine carboxylase) is the amino acid sequence that is completely conserved in all published mammalian sequences and almost completely conserved in all of the sequences obtained in this study (Fig. 2).

Chem. 2000; 275: 18291-18296Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) have recently made a similar observation. They cloned this gene from Drosophila. Expression of this gene in insect cells resulted in the expression of vitamin K-dependent carboxylase activity, thus demonstrating that the product of this homologous gene has functional homology as well. Neither γ-carboxyglutamic acid nor γ-carboxyglutamic acid-containing proteins have been identified in Drosophila. The marked homology of the mammalian carboxylases suggests the importance of vitamin K and the synthetic machinery to generate γ-carboxyglutamic acid. The evolutionary conservation of this complex enzymatic system requiring exogenous vitamin K or a vitamin K-like cofactor and multiple enzymes for vitamin K transport and metabolism suggests a critical role for γ-carboxyglutamic acid that has been retained throughout phylogeny. γ-Carboxyglutamic acid is important for calcium binding and plays a critical functional role in generating the membrane binding properties of the vitamin K-dependent blood clotting proteins (24Furie B. Bouchard B. Furie B.C. Blood. 1999; 93: 1798-1808Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The role of γ-carboxyglutamic acid in other mammalian proteins such as osteocalcin and matrix Gla protein remains uncertain. The role of γ-carboxyglutamic acid in the conotoxins also remains speculative, despite the determination of the structures of some of these peptides (21Rigby A. Lucas-Mernier E. Kalume D. Czerwiec E.

Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 15677-15684Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). We suspect that γ-carboxyglutamic acid plays a broader role than the highly specialized activities associated with membrane interaction. Perhaps, γ-carboxyglutamic acid is critical for function of certain housekeeping proteins that are ubiquitous in animal cells, although it would appear that vitamin K-dependent carboxylation is not a required step until late in embryogenesis.1 Isolation of novel γ-carboxyglutamic acid-containing proteins from these invertebrate species should provide insight into these functions. The major implication of this work is that the vitamin K-dependent carboxylase is broadly distributed in animal phyla. Although γ-carboxyglutamic acid has not been directly identified in most of these phyla, it is highly likely that the preservation of the components of this complex enzymatic reaction for the biosynthesis of γ-carboxyglutamic acid throughout evolution in the animal kingdom indicates that γ-carboxyglutamic acid is present and functional in primitive and higher vertebrates as well as invertebrates. Although the function of γ-carboxyglutamic acid in the vitamin K-dependent blood coagulation proteins is understood within the context of conferring calcium and membrane binding properties (4Freedman S.J.

The wild-type cluster directed high levels of apoA-I gene expression in liver and intestine, moderate expression in kidney, and low to minimal expression in other tissues. It also directed high levels of chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) expression (used as a reporter for the apoCIII gene) in liver, low levels in intestine and kidney, and no expression in other tissues. Mutations in the apoCIII promoter and enhancer abolished the intestinal and renal expression of the apoA-Igene, reduced hepatic apoA-I expression by 80%, and abolished CAT expression in all tissues. A similar pattern of expression was obtained by mutations in the apoCIIIenhancer alone. Mutations in the proximal apoA-I promoter reduced by 85% hepatic and intestinal apoA-I expression and did not affect CAT expression. The findings suggest that a hormone response element within the apoCIII enhancer is essential for intestinal and renal expression of apoA-I and apoCIII genes and also enhances hepatic expression. The hormone response elements of the proximal apoA-I promoter or the apoCIII enhancer can promote independently low levels of hepatic and intestinal expression of the apoA-Igene in vivo.

As part of the current study, we have generated transgenic mice containing the WT and mutant regulatory regions of the apoA-I/apoCIII gene cluster. Mutations were created to destroy the HREs of the apoA-I promoter or the apoCIII promoter and enhancer region. The transgenic mouse lines were designed to address the following questions. Which regulatory elements control the tissue-specific expression of the human apoA-I and apoCIII gene in vivo? How do mutations in the proximal HREs affect the promoter strength in vivo? How do mutations in the HREs of the enhancer affect the tissue-specific expression of the two genes in vivo? Our findings suggest that the HREs of the apoA-I or apoCIII promoter and enhancer that bind HNF-4 control the overall expression of the apoA-I and apoCIIIgenes. When the proximal HREs are mutated, the apoCIIIenhancer alone may independently direct the expression of the apoA-I gene at lower levels in liver, intestine, and other tissues. Mutations in the proximal HREs reduce, but do not eliminate, the hepatic expression of the apoA-I and apoCIIIgenes. In contrast, mutations in the HRE of the apoCIIIenhancer abolished the intestinal and renal expression and reduced the hepatic expression of the two closely linked genes in vivo.

The human –890/+24 apoCIII promoter was amplified using the pUC-19 CIII promoter plasmid as a template and the CIII 890K and CIII 24E oligonucleotides (Table I) as primers. The pUC-19 CIII plasmid used as template in the polymerase chain reaction contains a 3-kb EcoRI-EcoRI fragment containing the N-terminal region and 5′ regulatory sequence that encompasses the apoCIII gene (23Roghani A. Zannis V.I. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 7428-7435Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The primers introduced KpnI and EcoRI sites at the 5′ and 3′ ends of the –890/+24 apoCIII promoter and enhancer region. Following digestion with KpnI and EcoRI, the amplified fragment was cloned into the corresponding sites of the pSPORT-1 plasmid (Life Technologies, Inc.). The EcoRI site of this plasmid was subsequently blunted by EcoRI digestion and filling of the 5′ protruding end using the Klenow fragment of the DNA polymerase I to generate the modified pSPORT-1 CIII WT plasmid.Table IOligonucleotide of primer sequence in PCR amplificationCIII 890KATAGGTACCGTTCCTCCCAGTTGCTCCC-III −910/−893 Antisense containing a KpnI siteCIII 24EAAAGAATTCCAGCTGCCTCTAGGGATGC-III +27/+11 sense Containing an EcoRI sitePCAT-1NAAGGAAAAAAGCGGCGCGGTCGACGGTACCAAGCTTCPUCSHCAT 255/273 sensePSV40A2AAGGAAAAAAGCGGCCGCAGACATGATAAGATACATTGAPUCSHCAT 1908/1891 Antisense containing a NotI sitePN2AAAGAATTCCTGCCTCTAGGGATGAACTGAGCAC-III +24/+1 antisense Containing an EcoRI siteCIIIBP-21-aBoldface letters indicate nucleotide substitutions.GTCAAGCTGAACAGCGCCCTGGGTCCTCAGTGCCTC-III −82/−48 sense MutagenicCIIIBP-11-aBoldface letters indicate nucleotide substitutions.GTTCAGCTTGACCCTGCTGACCAGTGGAGATGAGC-III −72/−104 antisense MutagenicPBN1ATAGGTACCGGATCCGTTCTTCCCAGTTGCTCCCACAGCC-III −890/−868 sense Containing KpnI and BamHI sitesCIII IP-11-aBoldface letters indicate nucleotide substitutions.TTTGCATAGCGTAACCCGAGGATAACATCCCTGGGGGAGGAGCTC-III −737/−760 antisense MutagenicCIII IP-21-aBoldface letters indicate nucleotide substitutions.CTCGGGTTACGCTATGCAAATAGGGAGCCTGGTGGAGGC-III −720/−687 sense MutagenicRev 5–26TCACACAGGAAACAGCTATGACCATGPUCSHCAT sense3 CAT-26CTCCATTTTAGCTTCCTTAGCTCCTGPUCSHCAT antisense1-a Boldface letters indicate nucleotide substitutions. Open table in a new tab A 5.5-kb region containing the entire apoA-I gene and a 2.1-kb promoter segment was excised from the pUC19 A-I CIII plasmid. This plasmid contains an 11-kb fragment that encompasses the apoA-I gene and the C-terminal region of the apoCIII gene, as obtained by EcoRI digestion of the genomic apoA-I λ6 clone (24Karathanasis S.K. Zannis V.I. Breslow J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 1983; 80: 6147-6151Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). The 5.5-kb XbaI apoA-I gene fragment was then cloned into the XbaI site of the modified pSPORT-1 CIII WT plasmid. The resulting pSPORT-1A-I WT-890/+24 CIII WT plasmid was digested with NotI and ligated with the CAT cDNA flanked by NotI sites to generate the pSPORT-1 A-I WT CIII WT CAT plasmid (Fig. 1 A). The CAT cDNA sequence containing NotI sites at the 5′ and 3′ ends was obtained by DNA amplification using the pUCSH CAT plasmid as a template (21Ogami K. Hadzopoulou-Cladaras M. Cladaras Zannis V.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 9808-9815Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and the pCAT-1N and pSV40A2 oligonucleotides (Table I) as 5′ and 3′ primers respectively. CAT cDNA sequence contains a unique EcoRI site that allows identification of the transgenic mice. The mutations in the HREs in element I4 of the apoCIII enhancer or in both elements B and I4 in the apoCIII promoter and enhancer region were generated by amplification and mutagenesis of the –890/+24 apoCIIIpromoter region using the oligonucleotides PN2 and PBN1 as 5′ and 3′ external primers and either the oligonucleotides CIII BP-1 and CIII BP-2 as 5′ and 3′ mutagenic primers for element B or the same external primers and the oligonucleotides CIII IP-1 and CIII IP-2 as 3′ and 5′ mutagenic primers for element I4 (Table I), and the pSPORT-1 CIII WT (–890/+24) plasmid as a template. In a typical amplification/mutagenesis reaction, the 5′ external primer and the 3′ mutagenic primer are used to amplify the upstream region of interest, and the 5′ mutagenic primer and 3′ external primer are used to amplify the downstream region of interest. Following amplification, an aliquot of 5λ containing the two amplification products were mixed and amplified using the 5′ and 3′ external primers. The amplified mutant –890/+24 apoCIII promoter region mutated in element I4 was excised via KpnI/EcoRI digestion and cloned into the corresponding sites of pSPORT-1 plasmid. This intermediate plasmid was used as a template for further mutagenesis of the promoter region using as external primers the PN2 and PBN1 oligonucleotides and as mutagenic primers the CIII BP1 and CIII BP2 oligonucleotides (Table I). The amplified –890/+24 apoCIII promoter region containing the mutations in elements B and I4 was digested with KpnI and EcoRI and cloned into the corresponding sites of the pSPORT-1 plasmid to generate the pSPORT-1 CIII (B+ I4) plasmid. The EcoRI site of this plasmid was eliminated as described for the WT construct, and the modified derivative was digested with SalI and BamHI. Similarly, a 6.89-kb fragment encompassing the 2.1-kb apoA-I promoter region, the entire apoA-I gene, and the CAT cDNA was obtained by BamHI and SalI digestion of the pSPORT-1A-I WT CIII WT CAT plasmid (Fig. 1 A). The mutated –890/+24 apoCIII promoter and enhancer sequence and the 6.89-kb apoA-I gene segment were introduced by triple ligation into the BamHI site of the pSPORT-1 plasmid to generate the pSPORT-1 A-I WT CIII (B+ I4) CAT plasmid (Fig. 1 B). Similarly, the mutated –890/+24 apoCIII enhancer sequence and the 6.89-kb apoA-I gene segment were introduced by triple ligation into the BamHI site of the pSPORT-1 plasmid to generate the pSPORT-1 A-I WT CIII (I4) CAT plasmid (Fig.1 C). The mutations in elements B and D of the –255/+5 apoA-Ipromoter were generated as described above (20Papazafiri P. Ogami K. Ramji D.P. Nicosia A. Monaci P. Cladaras C. Zannis V.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 5790-5797Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The –255/+5 apoA-I promoter region containing mutations in the HREs of elements B and D (15Tzameli I. Zannis V.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8402-8415Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) was amplified using as primers oligonucleotides Rev5–16 and 3 CAT-26 (Table I). A pBluescript A-I plasmid containing the 5.5-kb XbaI apoA-I gene segment described above was digested with XbaI, EcoRI, and AlfII to obtain a 3.9-kb fragment containing the apoA-I gene and a 1.6-kb fragment representing the intergenic sequence between the apoA-I and apoCIII genes. The same plasmid was also digested with XbaI and EcoRI to obtain a 6.3-kb XbaI/EcoRI sequence containing the 5′ upstream apoA-I promoter region along with the pBluescript plasmid. The XbaI/AlfII proximal apoA-Ipromoter region containing the two mutations in elements B+D and the XbaI/EcoRI and AlfII/EcoRI fragments containing the upstream apoA-I promoter and the coding apoA-I gene sequence were joined in a triple ligation to generate the pBluescript-1 A-I (B+D) plasmid. The insert of this plasmid was excised via XbaI digestion and was used to replace the 5.5-kb XbaI fragment containing the wild-type sequence from the pSPORT-1 A-I WT CIII WT CAT plasmid, thereby generating the mutant pSPORT-1 A-I (B+D) CIII WT CAT plasmid (Fig.1 D). In a separate construction, the insert of the pBluscript-1 A-I (B+D) plasmid was excised via XbaI digestion and was used to replace the 5.5-kb XbaI fragment containing the wild-type sequence from the pSPORT-1 A-I WT CIII(I4) CAT plasmid to generate a construct with mutations in the HREs on element B+D of the apoA-I promoter and I4 of the apoCIII enhancer (not shown). The correct sequence of these plasmids was confirmed by DNA sequencing. The inserts of the WT plasmids and the corresponding mutant pSPORT-1 plasmids containing mutations in the apoCIII promoter and enhancer or the proximal promoter were excised by BamHI digestion and used for microinjections into fertilized mouse embryos. Heterozygous transgenic mice used in these studies were generated using standard transgenic mice methodologies (25Le Beyec J. Chauffeton V. Kan H.-Y. Janvier P.-L. Cywiner C. Chatelet F.-P.

Embryos that survived microinjection were cultured for 30 min in M2 medium (26Hogan B. Manipulating the Mouse Embryo. A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1986Google Scholar) and then implanted into the oviduct of pseudopregnant female mice (Swiss Webster) mated previously with vasectomized male mice (Swiss Webster). Thirty embryos were implanted in each female pseudopregnant mouse. Recipient mice progressed through gestation, and approximately 70% of them gave birth to transgenic mice. Typically, about 20–30% of the littermates were identified as transgenic founders (Fo) by Southern blotting of DNA isolated from tail biopsies of 4-week-old mice. Identification was confirmed by Southern blotting of mouse genomic DNA following EcoRI digestion and hybridization with the 978-bp apoA-I probe. This analysis detected an 8.2-kb band in the transgenic mice that corresponds to microinjected transgene. The apoA-I probe used for a hybridization represented 978 bp of the apoA-I gene restriction fragment, comprising 540 bp of exon 4 and 438 bp of the intergenic sequence between the apoA-I and apoCIII genes. F1 progeny of transgenic mice were obtained through breeding of the Fo founders. Three or four transgenic mouse lines were generated per construct to overcome positional effects and ensure that the pattern of expression is characteristic of a specific construct. Levels of total serum cholesterol and serum TG were determined using commercially available enzymatic kits (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). ApoA-I levels were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Total cellular RNA was isolated from liver and other tissues using the guanidine isothiocyanate method. The RNA was purified using the Qiagen RNA/DNA midi-kit. RNA was eluted with high salt buffer, precipitated by isopropanol, and dissolved in RNase-free water. Equal quantities of RNA (10 μg) were separated by electrophoresis in 1.0% agarose-formaldehyde gels. Following transfer to a Hybond-N+ nylon membrane (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), the RNA was cross-linked to the filter by UV irradiation (Stratalinker, Stratagene) at 0.12 J/cm2 for 1 min. The apoA-I probe for hybridization is 438 bp in length. This probe contains 290 bp of exon 4 of human apoA-I and 148 bp of the intergenic sequence between the apoA-I and apoCIII genes and does not cross-hybridize with the mouse apoA-I mRNA. The mouse 28 S rRNA probe was obtained from Ambion (Austin, TX). This oligonucleotide probe contains 43 nucleotides of highly conserved sequences among higher eukaryotes. The 28 S rRNA probe was labeled by 5′ end labeling using T4 polynucleotide kinase method. The apoA-I mRNA of each sample was normalized by dividing with the 28 S rRNA signal. Hybridization reactions contained 1–2 × 106 cpm 32P-labeled DNA per ml of buffer. Unhybridized probe was removed by washing at 68 °C with 2× SSC, 0.1% SDS, followed by 15–30-min washes with 1× SSC and then with 0.5× SSC, as needed. Quantitation of x-ray film was performed using a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager using the Image Quant program. The relative levels (%) of apoA-I mRNA represents the ratio of apoA-I to 28 S ribosomal RNA signal or the ratio of apoA-I to mouse β-actin signal when the RNA levels of a single tissue from different mouse lines were compared. For S1 nuclease mapping (27Berk A.J. Sharp P.A. Cell. 1977; 12: 721-732Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1567) Google Scholar), RNA was prepared from liver and other tissues using the lithium chloride method (28Auffray C. Rougeon F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1980; 107: 303-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (2087) Google Scholar). A 30-s sonication step was added after homogenization of the tissue (27Berk A.J. Sharp P.A. Cell. 1977; 12: 721-732Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1567) Google Scholar). The actin probe (ATCC) represented a 240-bp AvaI/BamHI restriction fragment of the mouse β-actin gene and contained 100 bp of exon I and 140 bp of the 5′ end of the gene (29Alonso S. Minty A. Bourlet Y. Buckingham M. J. Mol. Evol. 1986; 23: 11-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (604) Google Scholar). The 978-bp apoA-I probe has been described above. A specific 540-bp apoA-I mRNA signal and a 100-bp mouse β-actin signal was obtained by this analysis. For the CAT assay, F1 mice were sacrificed at 2 months of age. Tissues were collected and used immediately or were frozen and stored at −80 °C. CAT assays were performed as described (30Pothier F. Quellet M. Julien J.P. Guerin S.L. DNA Cell Biol. 1992; 11: 83-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Briefly, the tissue was homogenized in polytron homogenizer on ice using 5 μl of 15 mm Tris·Cl buffer, pH 8.0 (containing 1 mm dithiothreitol and 0.4 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), per mg of tissue, 50 mmKCl, 15 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 0.15 mmspermine. The supernatant of the homogenate was heated at 65 °C for 8 min and centrifuged in a microcentrifuge for 3 min. The supernatant was used for CAT and protein determination assays. The specific activity was calculated as pmol of product/mg of protein. The concentration of soluble protein was determined by the Bio-Rad protein assay. The percentage of chloramphenicol converted to acetylated forms was determined either by densitometric scanning of autoradiograms or by scraping individual spots from the TLC and counting in a scintillation counter. CAT activities were expressed as pmol of acetyl chloramphenicol generated per min per mg of protein, after subtracting the background for each tissue from control mice that did not express the CAT gene. We have generated and studied in detail four sets of mouse lines expressing the constructs of Fig. 1. The top construct designated AI WT C-III WT contains 2.1 kb of the 5′ regulatory sequence along with 1.81 kb containing the entire coding sequence of apoA-I gene, a 1.6-kb segment containing the intragenic sequence, and the CAT gene in front of the –890/+24 regulatory sequence of the apoCIII gene. In this construct, the apoCIII gene was replaced by the CAT cDNA sequence (Fig. 1 A). The second construct, designated A-I WT CIII (B+I4) Mut, contains mutations in the two HREs of elements B and I4 respectively, of the apoCIII promoter and enhancer (Fig. 1 B). The third construct, designated AI WT CIII I4 Mut, contains a mutation in element I4 of the apoCIII enhancer (Fig. 1 C). The fourth construct, designated A-I (B+D)Mut CIII WT, contains mutations in elements B and D of the proximal apoA-Ipromoter (Fig. 1 D). Transgenes containing the WT and the three mutant apoA-I/CIII promoter constructs were excised from the corresponding pSPORT-1 constructs, separated by agarose gel electrophoresis, electroeluted, and purified on QIAEXII gel extraction system (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). The names of the transgenes are shown in parentheses in Fig. 1. These names are utilized throughout the text. The purified DNA fragments were dissolved in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.1 mm EDTA, at a concentration of 2 ng/μl, and were microinjected into fertilized eggs from C57BL/6J females mated with males of the same strain. Transgenic founders were identified by Southern blotting analysis using as probe the 978-bp apoA-I fragment described under “Experimental Procedures.” The number of transgene copies incorporated into the genome of each transgenic founder was determined by Southern blotting and by comparison of the intensity of the bands formed when increasing amounts of the transgene were diluted in nontransgenic DNA (Fig. 2). The four transgenic lines expressing the apoA-I WT CIII WT promoter enhancer cluster contain 3, 5, 25, and 30 copies of the transgene, respectively. Finally, the transgenic lines carrying A-I (B+D) Mut CIII WT construct contain 1, 15, and 30 copies of the"
