https://openalex.org/W1596577347,"Proteoglycan monomer (D1) and aggregate (A1) preparations were isolated from 4 M guanidinium chloride extracts of the Swarm rat chondrosarcoma. When EDTA, 6-aminohexanoic acid, and benzamidine were present in the solutions, the D1 preparation contained a single component (SO = 23 S), and the A1 preparation contained 30% monomer (SO = 23 S) and 70 percent aggregate (SO = 111 S). In the absence of EDTA, 6-aminohexanoic acid, and benzamidine, the A1 preparations contained only small proteoglycan fragments, indicating that extensive enzymatic degradation had occurred. The composition of the proteoglycan monomer was different from that of proteoglycan monomer preparations from normal hyaline cartilages in that it did not contain keratan sulfate and chondroitin 6-sulfate; only chondroitin 4-sulfate was found. The A1 preparation from the chondrosarcoma contained only one link protein, which was like the smaller (molecular weight of 40,000) of the two link proteins present in A1 preparations from bovine nasal cartilage. When the A1 preparation from the chondrosarcoma was treated with chondroitinase ABC and trypsin and the digest was chromatographed on Sepharose 2B, a complex was isolated which contained the link protein and the segments of the protein core from the hyaluronic acid-binding region of the proteoglycan molecules."

Addition of KCl, 75 to 100 mM, to sucrose extracts of macrophages stirred at 25 degrees caused actin to polymerize and bind to a protein of high molecualr weight. The complex precipitated and sedimented at low centrifugal forces. Macrophage actin was dissociated from the binding protein with 0.6 M KCl, and purified by repetitive depolymerization and polymerization. Purified macrophage actin migrated as a polypeptide of molecular weight 45,000 on polyacrylamide gels with dodecyl sulfate, formed extended filaments in 0.1 M KCl, bound rabbit skeletal muscle myosin in the absence of Mg-2+ATP and activated its Mg-2+ATPase activity. Macrophage myosin was bound to actin remaining in the macrophage extracts after removal of the actin precipitated with the high molecular weight protein by KCl. The myosin-actin complex and other proteins were collected by ultracentrifugation. Macrophage myosin was purified from this complex or from a 20 to 50% saturated ammonium sulfate fraction of macrophage extracts by gel filtration on agarose columns in 0.6 M Kl and 0.6 M Kl solutions. Purified macrophage myosin had high specific K-+- and EDTA- and K-+- and Ca-2+ATPase activities and low specific Mg-2+ATPase activity. It had subunits of 200,000, 20,000, and 15,000 molecular weight, and formed bipolar filaments in 0.1 M KCl, both in the presence and absence of divalent cations. The high molecular weight protein that precipitated with actin in the sucrose extracts of macrophages was purified by gel filtration in 0.6 M Kl-0.6 M KCl solutions. It was designated a macrophage actin-binding protein, because of its association with actin at physiological pH and ionic strength. On polyacrylamide gels in dodecyl sulfate, the purified high molecular weight protein contained one band which co-migrated with the lighter polypeptide (molecular weight 220,000) of the doublet comprising purified rabbit erythrocyte spectrin. The macrophage protein, like rabbit erythrocyte spectrin, was soluble in 2 mM EDTA and 80% ethanol as well as in 0.6 M KCl solutions, and precipitated in 2 mM CaCl2 or 0.075 to 0.1 M KCl solutions. The macrophage actin-binding protein and rabbit erythrocyte spectrin eluted from agarose columns with a KAV of 0.24 and in the excluded volumes. The protein did not form filaments in 0.1 M KCl and had no detectable ATPase activity under the conditions tested."

https://openalex.org/W1595850806,"Native solium and potassium adenosine triphosphatase from guinea pig kidney accepted a phosphate group from radioactive inorganic phosphate to form an acyl phosphate bond at the active site in the presence or absence of sodium ion. Magnesium ion was always required. In the presence of sodium ion and absence of adenosine triphosphate, there was no phosphorylation by inorganic phosphate. Addition of unlabeled adenosine triphosphate produced a potassium-sensitive phosphoenzyme which exchanged its phosphate-group with radioactive inorganic phosphate. The dephosphoenzyme was an intermediate in this exchange. The rate constant for dephosphorylation was about 0.05 per second. Addition of rubidium ion, a congener of potassium ion, to the potassium-sensitive phosphoenzyme produced a phosphoenzyme labeled from inorganic phosphate with a corresponding rate constant of 0.26 per s. This was a rubidium-complexed phosphoenzyme. Addition of magnesium ion to potassium-sensitive phosphoenzyme converted it into insensitive phosphoenzyme, the splitting of which was not accelerated by potassium ion or by adenosine diphosphate. Its rate constant was 0.07 per s. In the absence of sodium ion and adenosine triphosphate, inorganic phosphate was incorporated directly into a similar insensitive phosphoenzyme. In the presence of potassium ion or rubidium ion, inorganic phosphate was incorporated into a potassium-complexed or rubidium-complexed phosphoenzyme which exchanged 32-P with inorganic phosphate completely in less than 3 s. Incorporation of inorganic phosphate into a complex of the enzyme with the inhibitor, ouabain, is already described in the literature. Its rate constant was about 0.02 per s. Thus there appear to be at least four reactive states of the phosphoenzyme which equilibrate measurably with inorganic phosphate, namely, potassium-sensitive phosphoenzyme, potassium-complexed phosphoenzyme, insensitive phosphoenzyme, and ouabain phosphoenzyme. Two of these reactive states are functional intermediates in native sodium and potassium ion transport adenosine triphosphatase. The results are compatible with control of the reactivity of the active site by conformational changes in the surrounding active center and with regulation of the energy level of the phosphate group according to the kind of monovalent cation bound to the enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1548422633,"1. Prolonged treatment of coupling factor I (CF1) from spinach chloroplasts with trypsin free of chymotrypsin yielded an active ATPase. The isolated preparation showed only two polypeptide chains (mol wt 55,000 to 60,000) on acrylamide gels run in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate. The three smaller subunits of CF1 were not detectable. The preparation no longer served as a coupling factor for photophosphorylation in either EDTA- or silicotungstate-treated chloroplasts. 2. An antiserum prepared against coupling factor I from chloroplasts inhibited the ATPase activity of the trypsin-treated CF1. In contrast, antisera prepared against the two individual (denatured) subunits did not inhibit the ATPase activity when tested either alone or together, although each interacted with the trypsin-treated protein, forming precipitin lines in Ouchterlony plates. 3. The trypsin-treated enzyme was still cold-labile, showing that the three smaller subunits are not required for this property. However, the enzyme was no longer sensitive to the natural inhibitor protein which is one of its subunits (subunit epislon), but was still sensitive to inhibition by the flavonoid quercetin. 4. Two equivalents of 7-chloro-4-nitrobenzo-2-oxa-1,3-diazole were sufficient to inhibit about 80% of the ATPase activity of the coupling factor, irrespective of whether it contained two of five subunits. The inhibition was completely reversed by dithiothreitol. 5. Triated 7-chloro-4-nitrobenzo-2-oxa-1,3-diazole was prepared. Treatment of the coupling factor with this tritium-labeled inhibitor followed by electrophoresis on acrylamide gels revealed that most of the radioactivity was incorporated into the beta subunit of the enzyme (molecular weight 56,000)."

https://openalex.org/W1695152928,"The interactions were analyzed between actin, myosin, and a recently discovered high molecular weight actin-binding protein (Hartwig, J. H., and Stossel, T. P. (1975) J. Biol Chem.250,5696-5705) of rabbit alveolar macrophages. Purified rabbit alveolar macrophage or rabbit skeletal muscle F-actins did not activate the Mg2+ATPase activity of purified rabbit alveolar macrophage myosin unless an additional cofactor, partially purified from macrophage extracts, was added. The Mg2+ATPase activity of cofactor-activated macrophage actomyosin was as high as 0.6 mumol of Pi/mg of myosin protein/min at 37 degrees. The macrophage cofactor increased the Mg2+ATPase activity of rabbit skeletal muscle actomyosin, and calcium regulated the Mg2+ATPase activity of cofactor-activited muscle actomyosin in the presence of muscle troponins and tropomyosin. However, the Mg2+ATPase activity of macrophage actomyosin in the presence of the cofactor was inhibited by muscle control proteins, both in the presence and absence of calcium. The Mg2+ATPase activity of the macrophage actomyosin plus cofactor, whether assembled from purified components or studied in a complex collected from crude macrophage extracts, was not influenced by the presence of absence of calcium ions. Therefore, as described for Acanthamoeba castellanii myosin (Pollard, T. D., and Korn, E. D. (1973) J. Biol. Chem. 248, 4691-4697), rabbit alveolar macrophage myosin requires a cofactor for activation of its Mg2+ATPase activity by F-actin; and no evidence was found for participation of calcium ions in the regulation of this activity. In macrophage extracts containing 0.34 M sucrose, 0.5 mM ATP, and 0.05 M KCl at pH 7.0,the actin-binding protein bound F-actin into bundles with interconnecting bridges. Purified macrophage actin-binding protein in 0.1 M KCl at pH 7.0 also bound purified macrophage F-actin into filament bundles. Macrophage myosin bound to F-actin in the absence but not the presence of Mg2+ATP, but the actin-binding protein did not bind to macrophage myosin in either the presence or absence of Mg2+ATP."

The plasma membranes are stabilized against fragmentation and vesiculation by treatment of intact cells with concanavalin A just prior to lysis. After lysis, the concanavalin A-stabilized plasma membrane ghosts are isolated by low speed centrifugation techniques and the purified ghosts subsequently converted to vesicles by removal of the bulk of the concanavalin A. The yield of ghosts is about 50% whereas the yield of vesicles is about 20%. The isolated plasma membrane vesicles have a characteristically high sterol to phospholipid ratio, Mg2+-dependent ATPase activity and (Na+ plus K+)-stimulated Mg2+ATPase activity. Only traces of succinate dehydrogenase and 5'-nucleotidase are present in the plasma membrane preparations."
https://openalex.org/W1500442791,"Radioactive adenosine triphosphate was synthesized transiently from adenosine diphosphate and radioactive inorganic phosphate by sodium and potassium adenosine triphosphatase from guinea pig kidney. In a first step, K+-sensitive phosphoenzyme was formed from radioactive inorganic phosphate in the presence of magnesium ion and 16 mM sodium ion. In a second step the addition to the phosphoenzyme of adenosine diphosphate with a higher concentration of sodium ion produced adenosine triphosphate. Recovery of adenosine triphosphate from the phosphoenzyme was 10 to 100% in the presence of 96 to 1200 mM sodium ion, respectively. Potassium ion (16mM) inhibited synthesis if added before or simultaneously with the high concentration of sodium ion but had no effect afterward. The half-maximal concentration for adenosine diphosphate was about 12 muM. Ouabain inhibited synthesis. The ionophore gramicidin had no significant effect on the level of phosphoenzyme nor on the rate nor on the extent of synthesis of adenosine triphosphate. The detergent Lubrol WX reduced the rate of phosphoenzyme break-down and the rate of synthesis but did not affect the final recovery. Phospholipase A treatment inhibited synthesis. In a steady state, the enzyme catalzyed a slow ouabain-sensitive incorporation or inorganic phosphate into adenosine triphosphate. These results and other suggest that binding of sodium ion to a low affinity site on phosphoenzyme formed from inorganic phosphate is sufficient to induce a conformational change in the active center which permits transfer of the phosphate group to adenosine diphosphate."
https://openalex.org/W1535477758,"Heavy meromyosin, obtained by tryptic digestion of myosin, containing two main polypeptides whose masses were estimated as 81,000 and 74,000 dlatons from Na dodecyl-SO4 polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, was further digested with trypsin. The Ca2+-activated ATPase activity remainded unchanged and the K+-EDTA activity increased while various smaller fragments were formed. The formation of some of these fragments is affected by Ca2+ or Mg2+ as first shown by Balint et al. (Balint, M., Schaefer, A., Biro, N. A., Menczel, L., AND Fejes, E. (1971) J. Physiol. Chem. Phys. 3, 455). On the basis of the time course of the appearance of fragments the following relationship emerges: see article. The 64K leads to 60K step is inhibited by divalent cations, while the breakdown of the 74K fragment is accelerated. The effect of Ca2+ was maximal at 0 similar to 0.1 muM, that of Mg2+ at 10 muM. The original light chains of myosin are not present in the heavy meromyosin serving as the starting material, but peptide material appears on electrophoresis in positions starting material, but peptide material appears on electrophoresis in positions where the light chains would be found. The fragments marked by an asterisk are considered to ba alpha-helical on the basis of their solubility at low ionic strength after precipitation with ethanol (Balint et al.). The fact that alpha helical fragments are derived from the 60,000-dalton fragment indicateds that it is adjacent to the light meromyosin in the intact myosin while the 74,000- dalton fragment would be part of heavy meromysoin subfragment 1. Chromatography of Sephadex G-200 separates fractions with ATPase activity corresponding to heavy meromyosin and heavy meromyosin subfragment 1. Electrophoresis of these Sephadex fractions suggests that the main peptide constituting heavy meromysoin subfragment 1 is connected by noncobalent forces to a portion of the rod that is not immediately adjacent to it in the primary sequence. The significance of this finding is discussed in terms of the flexibility of the myosin head."

https://openalex.org/W1487608633,"The chemical properties of two highly purified preparations of (sodium + potassium)-activated adenosine triphosphatase (NaK ATPase) and their subunits have been compared. One preparation is derived from the rectal gland of the spiny dogfish shark, Squalus acanthias and the other preparation is derived from the electric organ of the electric eel, Electrophorus electricus. Ouabain binding and phosphorylation from [gamma-32-P]ATP for both enzymes ranged from 4000 to 4300 pmol per mg of protein. This gives a stoichiometry for ouabain binding and phosphorylation of 1:1 for both enzymes. The molar ratios of catalytic subunit to glycoprotein was 2:1 for both enzymes, suggesting a minimum molecular weight of 250, 000, which agrees with the molecular weight obtained by radiation inactivation. Assuming that only one of the two catalytic subunits is phosphorylated and binds ouabain per (sodium + potassium)-activated adenosine triphosphatase molecule the data on phosphorylation and ouabain binding also give a molecular weight of 250, 000. The data on phosphorylatiion, ouabain binding, subunit composition, and molecular weight based on radiaion inactivation are thus all internally consistent. A technique has been developed for isolation of pure catalytic subunit and glycoprotein in good yields by preparative sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. A variety of chemical studies have been carried out with the purified subunits. The amino acid composition of the catalytic subunit was different from that of the glycoprotein, but the amino acid composition of each of the two subunits was essentially the same for both species. However, the NH2-terminal amino acid for the catalytic subunit was alanine for the rectal gland enzyme and serine for the electric organ enzyme, suggesting some differencesin amino acid sequences for the two species. The NH2-terminal amino acid for the glycoprotein was alanine for the two species. The glycoproteins from both species contained the same carbohydrates but in quite differing amounts. The carbohydrates were glucosamine, sialic acid, fucose, galactose, mannose, and glucose. The release of all the sialic acid from the electric organ enzyme and the release of 40% of the sialic acid from the rectal gland enzyme did not affect (sodium + potassium)-activated adenosine triphosphatase activity. Both enzymes contained the following phospholipids, which accounted for 98 to 100% of the total phospholipid phosphorus: sphingomyelin, lecithin, phosphatidylserine, phosphatidylethanolamine, and phosphatidylinositol. With the exception of phosphatidylethanolamine, and phosphatidylinositol. With the exception of phosphatidylserine, the amount of any phospholipid per mg of enzyme as well as the total phospholipid content were quite different for the two enzymes."

Their membranes were fractionated by sedimentation-rate and isopycnic zonal centrifugation. All the iodinated proteins except the very prominently labeled high molecular weight protein (greater than 200,000 daltons) were located in a fraction identified enzymically and compositionally as plasma membrane. The high molecular weight protein that was previously shown to be sensitive to virus transformation (Hynes, 1973) is concentrated in a very high density particle (rho equals 1.253-1.259) which contains mainly carbohydrate and protein and very low levels of lipid. 5'-nucleotidase was the only enzyme reproducibly demonstrated in this fraction, and electron micrographs revealed a predominantly amorphous morphology together with a few membraneous structures. The iodine label in this fraction was very sensitive to trypsinization prior to homogenization. All the available evidence indicates that this fraction is derived from the surface coat. Mitochondria, nuclei, and soluble protein were labeled to an insignificant extent. The presence of the iodinated surface proteins associated with the endoplasmic reticulum fraction is discussed in the light of these results."
https://openalex.org/W2063566642,"Magnesium adenosine triphosphate (Mg-2+-ATP) is known to produce dissociation of muscle actin and myosin in vitro, while its hydrolysis leads to reassociation. The interaction of purified actin and myosin from human muscle, in the presence of Mg-2+-ATP, was stimulated by minute amounts of adenosine diphosphate (ADP), a product of ATP hydrolysis. By contrast, the dissociation of the actomyosin complex was inhibited by ADP. These data suggest that ADP serves to modulate muscle contraction. Ethanol and its primary metabolite, acetaldehyde, inhibited these effects of ADP. The inhibition was reversible when the preparations were freed of these compounds. The effects of ethanol and acetaldehyde on the response of actomyosin to ADP may play a role in the pathogenesis of alcoholic myopathy and cardiomyopathy."

ATP was added to the outside of the vesicles after they had equilibrated with radioactive tracer, and the resulting active transport of Na+ and K+ was followed. Unlike the purified kidney renal medulla enzyme used in an earlier study, the brain enzyme transports both Na+ and K+(Rb+). Vesicles were made in solutions with different proportions of NaCl and KCl, and over the range studied, an average of 1.8 Rb+ ions were transported for every 3 Na+ ions.

This fragment consists of three chains with molecular weights of 15,000 (Dbeta), 42,500 (Dgamma1) or 39,500 (Dgamma2), and 14,000 (Dalpha) held together by disulfide bonds. The S-carboxymethyl derivatives of the chains have been separated by gel filtration and ion exchange chromatography, and their identity has been confirmed by peptide mapping and immunological analysis. The chain with a molecular weight of 45,000 is a fragment of the Bbeta chain of fibrinogen. The chain derived from the gamma chain of fibrinogen occurred in two molecular forms having molecular weight 42,500 and 39,500. The chain derivative with molecular weight 14,000 is most likely derived from the Aalpha chain of fibrinogen. The chains were characterized by NH2-terminal sequence analysis, amino acid composition, and carbohydrate staining. The two molecular analysis, amino acid composition, and carbohydrate staining. The two molecular forms of the gamma chain appeared to be identical except for an NH2-terminal peptide extension of 23 amino acid residues in the longer chain. The latter has sequences in common with the COOH-terminal part of the gamma chain of the NH2-terminal disulfide knot (BROMBACK, B., BRONDAHL, N. J., HESSEL, B., IWANAGA, S., and WALLEN, P. (1973) J.

Trypsin treatment of this complex selectively cleaves the large polypeptide into two fragments with molecular weights of 62,000 and 43,000. Simultaneously with the appearance of these fragments, (Na + K)-APTase activity is destroyed. Trypsin treatment of phosphorylated enzyme shows that he 43,000 molecular weight fragment is phosphorylated. If (Na + K)-ATPase is digested with trypsin in the presence of ATP, a 90,000 molecular weight fragment is produced. Disappearance of the large polypeptide, and loss of ATPase activity parallel the production of this fragment. Addition of strophanthidin to this mixture significantly lowers the amount of the 90,000 molecular weight fragment produced.

https://openalex.org/W1601606355,"A method was developed to study the unsupplemented phenylalanine hydroxylase system in rat liver slices. All of the components of the system--tetrahydrobiopterin, dihydropteridine reductase, and the hydroxylase itself--are present under conditions which should be representative of the actual physiological state of the animal. The properties of the system in liver slices have been compared to those of the purified enzyme in vitro. The three pterins, tetrahydrobiopterin, 6,7-dimethyltetrahydropterin, and 6-methyltetrahydropterin, all stimulate the hydroxylation of phenylalanine when added to the liver slice medium in the presence of a chemical reducing agent. The relative velocities found at 1 mM phenylalanine and saturating pterin concentrations are: tetrahydrobiopterin, 1; 6,7-dimethyltetrahydropterin, 2.5; 6-methyltetrahydropterin, 13. This ratio of activities is similar to that found for the purified, native phenylalanine hydroxylase and indicates that the enzyme in vivo is predominantly in the native form. Rats pretreated with 6-methyltetrahydropterin showed enhanced phenylalanine hydroxylase activity in liver slices demonstrating for the first time that an exogenous tetrahydropterin can interact with the phenylalanine hydroxylase system in vivo. This finding opens up the possibility of treating phenylketonurics who still possess some residual phenylalanine hydroxylase activity with a tetrahydropterin like 6-methyltetrahydropterin which can give a large increase in rate over that seen with the natural cofactor, tetrahydrobiopterin."

https://openalex.org/W1492682176,"The control of pyruvate dehydrogenase activity by inactivation and activation was studied in intact mitochondria isolated from rabbit heart. Pyruvate dehydrogenase could be completely inactivated by incubating mitochondria with ATP, oligomycin, and NaF. This loss in dehydrogenase activity was correlated with the incorporation of 32P from [gamma-32P]ATP into mitochondrial protein(s) and with a decrease in the mitochondrial oxidation of pyruvate. ATP may be supplied exogenously, generated from endogenous ADP during oxidative phosphorylation, or formed from exogenous ADP in carbonyl cyanid p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone-uncoupled mitochondria. With coupled mitochondria the concentration of added ATP required to half-inactivate the dehydrogenase was 0.24 mM. With uncoupled mitochondria the apparent Km was decreased to 60 muM ATP. Inactivation of pyruvate dehydrogenase by exogenous ATP was sensitive to atractyloside, suggesting that pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase acts internally to the atractyloside-sensitive barrier. The divalent cation ionophore, A23187, enhanced the loss of dehydrogenase activity. Pyruvate dehydrogenase activity is regulated additionally by pyruvate, inorganic phosphate, and ADP. Pyruvate, in the presence of rotenone, strongly inhibited inactivation. This suggests that pyruvate facilitates its own oxidation and that increases in pyruvate dehydrogenase activity by substrate may provide a modulating influence on the utilization of pyruvate via the tricarboxylate cycle. Inorganic phosphate protected the dehydrogenase from inactivation by ATP. ADP added to the incubation mixture together with ATP inhibited the inactivation of pyruvate dehydrogenase. This protection may result from a direct action on pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase, as ADP competes with ATP, and an indirect action, in that ADP competes with ATP for the translocase. It is suggested that the intramitochondrial [ATP]:[ADP] ratio effects the kinase activity directly, whereas the cytosolic [ATP]:[ADP] ratio acts indirectly. Mg2+ enhances the rate of reactivation of the inactivated pyruvate dehydrogenase presumably by accelerating the rate of dephosphorylation of the enzyme. Maximal activation is obtained with the addition of 0.5 mM Mg2+.."
https://openalex.org/W1581908491,"The data presented in this paper show that when rabbit plasminogen is activated to plasmin by urokinase at least two peptide bonds are cleaved in the process. Urokinase first cleaves an internal peptide bond in plasminogen, leading to two-chain disulfide-linked plasmin molecule. The plasmin heavy chain of molecular weight 66,000 to 69,000 possesses an NH2-terminal amino acid sequence identical with the original plasminogen (molecular weight 88,000 to 92,000). The plasmin light chain of molecular weight 24,000 to 26,000 is known to be derived from the COOH-terminal portion of plasminogen. The plasmin generated during the activation of plasminogen is capable, by a feedback process, of cleaving a peptide of molecular weight 6,000 to 8,000 from the NH2 terminus of the heavy chain, producing a proteolytically modified heavy chain of molecular weight 58,000 to 62,000. Plasmin also can cleave this same peptide from the original plasminogen, yielding an altered plasminogen of molecular weight 82,000 to 86,000. This plasmin-altered plasminogen and the plasmin heavy chain derived from it by urokinase activation process NH2-terminal amino acid sequences which are identical with each other and with the plasminolytic product of the original plasmin heavy chain. These studies support a mechanism of activation of plasminogen by urokinase which involves loss of a peptide located on the NH2 terminus of plasminogen. However, these same results show that this NH2-terminal peptide need not be released from rabbit plasminogen prior to the cleavage of the internal peptide bond which leads to the two-chain plasmin molecule. Furthermore, these studies show that urokinase cannot remove this peptide from either the original rabbit plasminogen molecule or from the heavy chain of the initial plasmin formed."

At a dose of 0.5 g/kg, the rate of release of deuterons is linear for 60 to 90 min. Male rats, which had previously been shown to have 22 to 25% more phenylalanine hydroxylase activity in liver extracts than female rats, produced deuterons from deuterated phenylalanine at a rate 20 to 30% greater than female rats. p-Chlorophenylalanine, which irreversibly inhibits phenylalanine hydroxylase in vivo, caused a similar degree of inhibition of the rate of deuteron formation as was found when phenylalanine hydroxylase was measured in extracts from the same group of animals. Methotrexate, which inhibits the phenylalanine hydroxylase system by preventing regeneration of the tetrahydropteridine cofactor, caused parallel inhibition of the in vivo assay as well as when the conversion of phenylalanine to tyrosine was measured in liver slices. Randomly ring-tritiated phenylalanine can be used interchangeably with ring-deuterated phenylalanine if greater sensitivity is needed in the in vivo assay for phenylalanine hydroxylase. However, a dose of 20 to 30 muCi/kg is required. The in vivo deuterium release assay described in this paper should be useful in studying the physiological control of the phenylalanine hydroxylating system. It also may be of value in differentiating between individuals who are heterozygotes for phenylketonuria and those who are homozygotes for hyperphenylalaninemia."

The rates of synthesis of each of the macromolecules have been estimated. Increasing the rate of growth (mu) up to 0.5, the ratio between the rates of synthesis of tRNA and rRNA decreases reaching a constant value. The equations that best describe the dependence of the rate of synthesis of the macromolecules on the rate of growth (mu) have been determined. The rate of rRNA synthesis (rr), expressed as nucleotides polymerized, min- minus 1 per genome, is given by the equation: rr equals 6.51 times 10-7 mu-2-19. The rate of protein synthesis (rp), expressed as amino acids polymerized, min- minus 1 per genome is given by the following relationship: rp equals -1.43 times 10-7 + 3.43 times 10-8 mu. The equation describing the tRNA synthesis (rt) expressed as nucleotides, min- minus 1 per genome is rt equals 6.45 times 10-5 times exp 2.30 mu; however, more accurate determinations appear to be required for a firmer assignment of this latter equation. The significance of these equations for the studies on the regulation of rRNA and protein synthesis is discussed. For instance the rate of rRNA synthesis may set the limit for the maximal growth rate attainable by a cell, as the maximal rate of rRNA synthesis that may take place in a given cell is limited by the degree of redundancy of the rRNA genes."
https://openalex.org/W2080040984,"Further evidence is presented in support of a model for growth control in which commitment for cell division is determined by an event in the preceding cell cycle. A study was made of conditions affecting synchronous growth following treatment of murine mastocytoma cells with excess thymidine at different phases of the cell cycle. Cells were synchronized by a physical procedure involving velocity sedimentation in a zonal rotor. Pulse treatment of such cultures with thymidine at times corresponding to the S, G2, and M periods had no effect on further growth. However, addition at G1, although having no immediate effect, arrested cell growth in the next cell cycle. This temporal effect may account for the decay of synchrony observed during double thymidine blockade or thymidine-FUdR blockade. When the time interval between two such blocks was 7 hr or less, P815Y cells were arrested after one synchronous division. At this critical time a majority of cells were at, or near, G1. It is suggested that thymidine exerts a hitherto unrecognized effect at the G1 interval."
https://openalex.org/W1499513280,"Acetyl phosphatidylethanolamine was compared with phosphatidylethanolamine in the reconstitution of several biological membrane activities with the following results. 1. The proton pump reconstituted with the purple membrane of Halobacterium halobium and acetyl phosphatidylethanolamine was quite active. However, some differences in the kinetic properties, particularly in the decay rate, were noted between vesicles reconsituted with phosphatidylethanolamine and acetyl phosphatidylethanolamine. 2. Acetyl phosphatidylethanolamine could not replace phosphatidylethanolamine in the reconstitution of a Ca-2 plus pump with ATPase isolated from sacoplasmic reticulum. However, inclusion of suitable amounts of stearylamine or oleylamine during reconstitution yielded acetyl phosphatidylethanolamine vesicles with Ca-2 plus translocation activity comparable to that of phosphatidylethanolamine vesicles. 3. A mixture of acetyl phosphatidylethanolamine and stearylamine or oleylamine substituted for phosphatidylethanolamine in the reconstitution of mitochondrial hydrophobic proteins to form vesicles that catalyze 32-Pi-ATP exchange. Since phosphatidylcholine is also required in this system, these findings point to two functions of phosphatidylethanolamine, one related to the specific properties of its amino group, the other to a structural role of its small polar head group. A hydrophobic alkylamine can fullfill the first function, acetyl phosphatidylethanolamine the second. 4. The importance of the charge was also observed in experiments with the reconstituted rutamycin-sensitive ATPase of mitochondria. After depletion of phospholipids from the hydrophobic proteins, ATPase activity and rutamycin sensitivity were restored only if a phospholipid as well as the appropriate charge were present."
https://openalex.org/W1522063950,"Detergent (Lubrol WX)-solubilized sodium-potassium-activated adenosine triphosphatase ((Na+ + K+)-ATPase) of electrophorus electric organ contains two major constituent polypeptides with molecular weights of 96,000 and 58,000 which can be readily demonstrated by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. These two polypeptides can be clearly separated and can be obtained in milligram quantities by preparative sodium dodecyl sulfate gel electrophoresis. The separated polypeptides, after removal of sodium dodecyl sulfate, and Lubrol-solubilized (Na+ + K+)-ATPase activity to some degree. Moreover, the degree of inhibition is directly proportional to the increasing amounts of antisera. The inhibition is maximal 4 weeks after the first injection. Immunodiffusion in 1% agar gel indicated that only Lubrol-solubilized enzyme antiserum, but not 58,000-dalton or 96,00-dalton polypeptide antiserum, gives one major precipitin band. However, specific complex formation between each polypeptide antiserum and Lubrol-solubilized enzyme occurs. This was demonstrated indirectly. After incubating Lubrol-solubilized enzyme with increasing amounts of polypeptide antisera at 37 degrees for 15 min, they were placed in the side wells of an immunodiffusion plate with antiserum against Lubrol-solubilized enzyme in the central well. The intensity of the precipitin band decreased with increasing amounts of polypeptide antisera. Thus, the results indicate that both 96,000-dalton and 58,000-dalton polypeptides are integral subunits of (Na+ + K+)-ATPase."
https://openalex.org/W1583511225,"The lipid-free particulate preparations of the mitochondrial ATPase require phospholipid for activity and can be inhibited by oligomycin, as has been demonstrated previously. In this communication a steady state analysis of the activation of a particulate preparation of the ATPase by phospholipids and its subsequent inhibition by oligomycin has been carried out. The relative affinity of the ATPase for purified phospholipids has been determined by measuring the Km for activation (Ka) for several phospholipids. The Ka values varied from 30 to 100 mum. The Vmax in the presence of phosphatides varies from 0.29 to 1.11 mumol ATP hydrolyzed/min/mg of protein; no correlation is noted between the relative affinity of the enzyme for a phospholipid and the V max value. Higher V max values are noted with the more acidic phospholipids, however. Sodium dodecyl sulfate and monoolein also activate with Ka values of 25 and 800 mum, respectively. Diglycerides, however, do not activate. With all lipids the ATPase activity stimulated is oligomycin-sensitive. The Ki values for oligomycin range from 0.1 to 0.6 mum. Oligomycin is a competitive inhibitor with respect to all the phospholipids tested except phosphatidylethanolamine and phosphatidyglycerol. It is also competitive with respect to sodium dodecyl sulfate (k-i equals 0.94 mum). In reciprocal plots of activity versus ATP concentration, with and without oligomycin, an intercept consistent with either mixed or partial noncompetitive inhibition kinetics is noted. Comparable K-i values for oligomycin are obtained when calculated assuming either mixed or partial noncompetitive inhibition. The Km for ATP is the same in the unactivated and the lipid activated particulate ATPase; the value obtained is slightly lower than the Km for ATP in the solubilized, purified ATPase. Using a spectrophotometric assay the time required for activation with phospholipid and inhibition with oligomycin has also been determined. This investigation suggests the possibility that activation of the ATPase is due a position to interact with the water-soluble substrate. Consistent with the above suggestion is the supposition that the lipids do not necessarily confer inhibitor sensitivity to the ATPase, but rather allow an oligomycin-sensitive activity to be expressed."

https://openalex.org/W1553492416,"Catabolic dehydroquinase which functions in the inducible quinic acid catabolic pathway in Neurospora crassa has been purified 8000-fold. The enzyme was purified by two methods. One used heat denaturation of contaminating proteins; the other used antibody affinity chromatography. The preparations obtained by these two methods were identical by all criteria. The purified enzyme is extremely resistant to thermal denaturation as well as denaturation 0y urea and guanidine hydrochloride at 25 degrees. It is irreversibly inactivated, although not efficiently dissociated, by sodium dodecyl sulfate and guanidine hydrochloride at 55 degrees. At pH 3.0, the enzyme is reversibly dissociated into inactive subunits. At high concentrations catabolic dehydroquinase aggregates into an inactive, high molecular weight complex. The native enzyme, which has a very high specific activity, has a molecular weight of approximately 220,000 and is composed of identical subunits of 8,000 to 12,000 molecular weight each. The native enzyme and the subunit are both asymmetric."

https://openalex.org/W1578854368,"The activation by Mg2+, in the presence of 0.2 mM Ca2+, of the erythrocyte ATPase from rats fed with six different fat-supplemented diets has been studied. A sigmoid kinetic curve was found. The values of the Hill coefficient showed a positive correlation with the membrane fatty acid fluidity, which is expressed as the ratio between double bond index and saturated fatty acid content. The values of the Hill coefficient ranged from 1.0, in animals fed with lard-supplemented diet, to 2.0, in animals fed with corn oil-supplemented diet. When the effect of increasing Ca2+ concentration in these two groups was studied at pH 8.1, an activation with the latter group and an inhibition with the former one were found. The activation by Ca2+ found in corn oil-fed animals was lost after treatment with phospholipase C and restored after the addition of homologous phospholipids. The activation could not be restored by addition of phospholipids from lard-fed animals. In this group, treatment with phospholipase C left the kinetic behavior unmodified, but an activation by Ca2+ could be detected after adding phospholipids from corn oil-fed animals. It is suggested that membrane fatty acid fluidity is involved in the cooperative transitions and cryptic activity of the (Mg2+ + Ca2+)-ATPase."
https://openalex.org/W1541685683,"Investigations have been made of the kinetic effects of the antibiotic aurovertin on the ATPase and ITPase activity of isolated rat liver mitochondrial ATPase. Unusual patterns of inhibition, decreasing slope, and increasing y-intercept values of double reciprocal plots, were observed with Mg-ATP as the substrate under various conditions. Under specified conditions, aurovertin stimulated hydrolysis of MgATP. The inhibition of MgITP hydrolysis was uncompetitive. Aurovertin eliminated the HCO3-minus stimulation of MgATP hydrolysis. The implications of these findings for the mechanism of mitochondrial ATPase are briefly discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1544047115,"Comparative physical and chemical data are described for the human NH2-terminal Glu-plasminogen and Lys-plasminogen forms in order to determine the exact relationship between these two types of the zymogen. The molecular weights of Glu-plasminogen and Lys-plasminogen were similar and were determined to be 83, 800 plus or minus 4, 500 and 82, 400 plus or minus 3, 300, respectively, by sedimentation equilibrium methods. The molecular weights were identical in dodecyl sulfate solutions, approximately 83, 000, by sedimentation equilibrium methods. The sedimentation coefficients, s-020, w of Glu-plasminogen and Lys-plasminogen were determined to be 5.0 S, and 4.4 S, respectively. These two plasminogen forms had different partial specific volumes, and calculations of the frictional coefficients from sedimentation coefficients and molecular weights indicated conformation differences. Glu-plasminogen appeared to be larger in size than Lys-plasminogen in acrylamide gel-dodecyl sulfate electrophoresis. The amino acid compositions of Glu-plasminogen and Lys-plasminogen, and their major isolated isoelectric forms, were found to be similar, but several amino acid residues (glutamic acid, alanine, isoleucine, phenylalanine, and lysine) were found to be significantly higher in the Glu-plasminogen forms. The derived plasmins from both the Glu- and Lys-plasminogens with an nh2-terminal Lys- heavy (A) chain were found to have identical molecular weights of 76, 500 plus or minus 2, 500, and sedimentation coefficients, s-020, w of 4.3 S."
https://openalex.org/W1545807190,"Myosin and its subfragments were trinitrophenylated under conditions in which mainly the site(s) was modified. Proteins modified at the site(s) could be separated by affinity chromatography on agarose-ATP columns. By two independent methods, ATPase activity measurements and analysis of elution patterns on agarose-ATP columns, it was shown that the introduction of two trinitrophenyl groups per myosin or one per heavy meromyosin subfragment 1 molecule is responsible for the remarkable change in the ATPase activities. Heavy meromyosin subfragment 1 prepared from trinitrophenylated myosin retained the original degree of trinitrophenylation per active head. The kinetic constant of trinitrophenylation of the epsilon-amino group of lysine at the site was found to be 2000 S-1-M-1, whereas a much smaller constant of 2.2 S-1-M-1 was obtained for the trinitrophenylation of the unessential lysyl residues of myosin. By using affinity chromatography, we could follow the formation of mono- and ditrinitrophenyl myosin. The amounts of these myosin derivatives at various extents of the reaction corresponded approximately to the calculated amounts, assuming a random and independent trinitrophenylation of the two myosin heads. It is concluded that in each of the two heads of myosin there is one ATPase site and these two sites behave in an identical manner with respect to trinitrophenylation."
https://openalex.org/W1539390675,"The fungus Neurospora crassa is known to possess a branched respiratory system consisting of the standard cytochrome chain and a cyanide-insensitive alternate oxidase. In the present experiments, the physiological function of the alternate oxidase has been analyzed by taking advantage of a number of cytochrome-deficient mutants, particularly poky f. Respiration, cellular ATP levels, and growth have been examined under the influence of three classes of inhibitors: inhibitors of the cytochrome chain (antimycin, cyanide), an inhibitor of the laternate oxidase (salicyl hydroxamic acid), and an uncoupling agent (carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone). The results indicate that the over-all efficiency of the alternate oxidase in producing ATP and supporting growth is much less than that of the cytochrome chain. Depending upon the amount of oxidative phosphorylation at Sites II and III in the cytochrome chain, which varies from strain to strain, the efficiency of the alternate oxidase relative to that of the cytochrome chain ranges from 13% in wild type Neurospora to 18 to 21% in poky f, 35% in mi-3, and 57% in cyt-2. A comparison of the short term effects of cyanide and carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone on cellular ATP in poky f suggests that, during respiration through the alternate oxidase, ATP can be produced both by substrate-level phosphorylation (accompanying glycolysis and the oxidation of alpha-ketoglutarate) and by oxidative phosphorylation at Site I. When cells are grown on sucrose, as much as 22% of ATP synthesis in the presence of cyanide occurs at Site I. When cells are grown on acetate to diminish the rate of glycolysis, the contribution of Site I becomes proportionately larger. Both the growth experiments and the short term inhibitor experiments reveal that ATP levels in Neurospora are kept high be a feedback process which depresses ATP breakdown (and growth) very quckly after ATP synthesis is inhibited. Thus, poky f grows more slowly that wild type Neurospora and is inhibited still further when either the cytochrome chain or the alternate oxidase is blocked. Under all of these conditions, however, cellular ATP in poky f is maintained at a high level (about 3 mmol per kg of cell water, slightly above the values measured in the wild type strain)."
https://openalex.org/W1991197866,"We have asked whether treatment of normal cultured cells with proteases, other hydrolytic enzymes, or serum can convert them into transient phenocopies of transformed cells with respect to the very high rate of hexose transport characteristic of transformed cells. Treatment of density-inhibited cultures of normal chick embryo fibroblasts with trypsin, plasmin, neuraminidase, or hyaluronidase stimulated their rate of 2-deoxyglucose uptake to a level only marginally higher than that seen in normal exponentially growing cultures, and only 35-45% of that seen in transformed cultures. Addition of the hydrolytic enzymes to growing cell cultures had little effect on 2-deoxyglucose uptake. Serum, however, could stimulate 2-deoxyglucose uptake all the way up to the transformed level. Even though the hydrolases and serum differed in their ability to stimulate 2-deoxyglucose uptake, both reagents were capable of stimulating cell division equally well. Evidence is presented suggesting that the hexose transport rate is controlled by serum factors, and that proteolysis can affect the response of the cells of these factors."
https://openalex.org/W165770879,"When human erythrocyte membranes are phosphorylated with a very low concentration of [gamma-32P]ATP (0.02 muM) at 0 degrees, and then EDTA is added, rapid disappearance of the phosphoenzyme intermediate of Na+ATPase is observed. The initial rapid phase of phosphoenzyme disappearance is, for the most part, not associated with P1 release and its rate constant, kD, is severalfold greater than the ratio of Na+ATPase activity to phosphoenzyme intermediate, v:EP, at steady state. It is concluded that this rapid disappearance of phosphoenzyme is due to resynthesis of ATP via reversal of phosphorylation. In contrast, rapid reversal is not observed when excess nonradioactive ATP is added to reduce E32P formation, provided Mg2+ is present; however, K+ added with the ATP stimulates reversal. Rapid reversal following EDTA addition is unlikely also when higher ATP concentrations (greater than or equal to 10(-6) M) are used to phosphorylate the enzyme since, at higher ATP, kD congruent to v:EP. The results are compatible with the concept that the Na+ATPase enzyme is composed of two or more catalytic subunits, in which ATP at one catalytic site can regulate the reactivity at another site."

Adsorption was irreversible. Orientation of absorbed molecules permitted association of bound muscle actin with platelet or muscle myosin. The association constant of the former reaction was 2.78 times 10-6 liters mol-1. Enzymatic properties of adsorbed actomyosin, Mg2+ATPase activity was abolished, but association of myosin with bound actin, or association of actin with bound myosin was accompanied by restoration of Mg2+ATPase activity. Every subunit of F-actin strands, unless F-actin had been fully depolymerized to G-actin, could bind myosin and activate Mg2+ATPase activity. Immunogenic characteristics of muscle myosin were enhanced by Lytron adsorption. Elicited antibodies showed selective specificity for an antigenic determinant located near or at the actin combining site of muscle myosin. Antibodies did not react with actomyosin. Antibodies prevented association of actin with muscle myosin because they inhibited both superprecipitation and development of Mg2+ATPase activity."

https://openalex.org/W1551846487,"Active transport of proline remained unaffected in phospholipase A-treated electron transport particles from Mycobacterium phlei. However, the steady state level of proline was reduced 50 to 60% in phospholipase A-treated depleted electron transport particles that were devoid of membrane-bound coupling factor-latent ATPase activity. The decrease in the uptake of proline in the phospholipase A-treated depleted electron transport particles was not due to a change in the apparent K-m for proline, but it was related to the amount of phospholipid cleaved from the membranes. Restoration in the level of proline transport in phospholipase A-treated depleted electron transport particles was achieved by reconstituting these vesicles with diphosphatidylglycerol and phosphatidylethanolamine liposomes. Diphosphatidylglycerol was found to be most effective in the restoration of proline uptake. In contrast to the effect of phospholipase A treatment on proline transport, similar treatement of the electron transport particles or depleted electron transport particles failed to inhibit the active transport of either glutamine or glutamic acid. Studies with phospholipase A-treated membrane vesicles confirmed earlier findings that a proton gradient is not required for active transport of amino acids."
