https://openalex.org/W1978419388,"The methylation state of DNA from human colon tissue displaying neoplastic growth was determined by means of restriction endonuclease analysis. When compared to DNA from adjacent normal tissue, DNA from both benign colon polyps and malignant carcinomas was substantially hypomethylated. With the use of probes for growth hormone, gamma-globin, alpha-chorionic gonadotropin, and gamma-crystallin, methylation changes were detected in all 23 neoplastic growths examined. Benign polyps were hypomethylated to a degree similar to that in malignant tissue. These results indicate that hypomethylation is a consistent biochemical characteristic of human colonic tumors and is an alteration in the DNA that precedes malignancy."
https://openalex.org/W1521095349,"Incubation of rat mast cells with compound 48/80 resulted in transient breakdown of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate, rapid generation of inositol polyphosphates, 45Ca inflow, and the arachidonic acid liberation mainly from phosphatidylcholine, eventually leading to histamine secretion. All of these processes of signaling from Ca-mobilizing receptors to degranulation were markedly inhibited by prior 2-h exposure of cells to islet-activating protein (IAP), pertussis toxin. A23187 caused 45Ca inflow and releases of arachidonic acid and histamine without inducing breakdown of inositol phospholipids. The effects of A23187, in contrast to those of compound 48/80, were not altered by the exposure of cells to IAP. Incubation of the supernatant fraction of mast cell homogenates with the active component of IAP caused the transfer of the ADP-ribosyl moiety of added [alpha-32P]NAD to a protein with Mr = 41,000. The IAP-catalyzed ADP-ribosylation of this protein was prevented by guanosine 5'-(3-O-thio)triphosphate, indicating that this IAP substrate resembles, in character, the alpha-subunit of the guanine nucleotide regulatory protein (Ni) involved in inhibition of adenylate cyclase. The degree of ADP-ribosylation of this IAP substrate was prevented progressively by pre-exposure of the homogenate-donor cells to increasing concentrations of IAP. The half-maximally effective concentrations of the toxin were 0.2 to 0.6 ng/ml for all the IAP-sensitive processes studied. Thus, the ADP-ribosylation of the Mr = 41,000 protein occurring during exposure of cells to IAP appears to be responsible for the inhibition of signaling observed. It is proposed that the alpha-subunit of Ni, or a like protein, mediates signal transduction arising from Ca-mobilizing receptors, probably prior to Ca2+ gating."

https://openalex.org/W1969591644,"The milk protein beta-lactoglobulin has been extensively studied but its function has not been identified. A clue regarding the function of a protein can be obtained by discovering a genetic relationship with a protein of known function through comparisons of amino acid sequence. Such comparisons revealed that beta-lactoglobulin is similar to human serum retinol-binding protein and to another human protein of unknown function known as complex-forming glycoprotein heterogeneous in charge (protein HC). beta-Lactoglobulins from several species have been found to bind retinol, while the absorption and fluorescence properties reported for the unidentified heterogeneous prosthetic group of protein HC are retinoid-like. The role of serum retinol-binding protein in vitamin A transport in the circulation suggests that the other two homologous proteins may function in the binding and transport of retinoids; beta-lactoglobulin may facilitate the absorption of vitamin A from milk and protein HC may mediate the excretion of retinol-derived metabolites."

https://openalex.org/W2088130891,"Recent investigations have begun to dissect the number and nature of genetic alterations associated with cancer cells. In the present study, primary human epidermal keratinocytes acquired indefinite life-span in culture but did not undergo malignant conversion in response to infection with a hybrid of adenovirus 12 and simian virus 40. Addition of Kirsten murine sarcoma virus, which contains a K-ras oncogene, to these cells induced morphological alterations associated with the acquisition of neoplastic properties. These findings demonstrate the malignant transformation of human primary epithelial cells in culture and support a multiple-step process for neoplastic conversion."

U.S.A. 80, 21-25) the spacing between the -35 and -10 consensus sequences is 16 base pairs. Between these two regions we inserted 1 or 2 base pairs to increase the distance to 17 base pairs (trc promoter) or 18 base pairs (tic promoter). The activities of the three promoters were compared in vivo by fusion to the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase or to the Escherichia coli 4.5 S RNA gene. Both measurements gave consistent results. The trc and tic promoters are on average about 90% and 65% as active as the tac promoter, respectively."
https://openalex.org/W1670509675,"Two distinct murine monoclonal antibodies, designated MA-I and MA-II, and limited proteolysis with thrombin and trypsin have been used to probe the structure of human platelet thrombospondin. The results indicate that each of the constituent chains of thrombospondin comprise four distinct polypeptide segments. The production of these segments is influenced by the presence of calcium, the enzyme employed, the temperature of digestion, and the enzyme-to-substrate ratio. Thrombin digestion in the presence of calcium results in the release of a 30,000-dalton fragment, designated segment I, which contains the epitope for MA-II and the heparin-binding site. Prior EDTA treatment results in the concomitant cleavage of a 25,000-dalton fragment, designated segment IV, from the other terminus. Limited tryptic digestion in the absence of calcium produces a 47,000-dalton fragment (segment III) which is adjacent to segment IV. Segment III contains the epitope for MA-I. Segment II is an 85,000-dalton fragment which contains the interchain disulfide bonds. Calcium inhibits proteolysis at cleavage sites between segments II and III and between segments III and IV. In the presence of calcium, an 85,000-dalton fragment is produced, which is derived from portions of segments II, III, and possibly IV. Electron microscopy of platinum replicas produced by low angle rotary shadowing reveals that thrombospondin is composed of four well-defined globular regions connected by thin flexible regions. Three of the globular regions, designated globular region C, appear to be at the ends of the three thin connecting regions. The fourth globular region, designated globular region N, appears to be close to the site where the chains are cross-linked. Globular region N can be resolved into three separate smaller globular structures which are 70 +/- 7.1 A in diameter. This region is selectively removed by thrombin digestion in the presence of calcium and binds a monoclonal antibody directed against the heparin-binding peptides. These data indicate that globular region N comprises the three NH2-terminal portions (segment I) from each of the three chains of thrombospondin. Globular region C is located at the ends of each of the three thin connecting regions which are each approximately 291 +/- 46 A long. The removal of calcium results in a decrease in the size of globular region C from 118 +/- 18.6 A to 80 +/- 7.4 A and an increase in the length of the adjacent thin connecting region to 383 +/- 30 A.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"

https://openalex.org/W1497123701,"A cDNA library constructed from human fibroblast poly(A+) RNA was screened for the identification of chimeric molecules bearing collagen-specific sequences. Analysis of three of the resulting positive clones showed that they encoded for the COOH-terminal propeptide region of the human Type III collagen. In addition, three overlapping clones covering more than 21 kilobases of the Type III gene were isolated from Charon 4A libraries of human genomic fragments. Identity between these and the cDNA clones was obtained by direct DNA sequencing. Establishment of the exon/intron arrangement of the Type III gene was obtained by electron microscopic analysis in conjunction with sequencing of selected genomic regions. Sequence comparison with other collagen genes confirmed some evolutionary features of this important family of proteins. Finally, the collinearity of two mRNA transcripts with 3' noncoding region length polymorphism was established."
https://openalex.org/W1999354584,"Borrelia hermsii, an agent of relapsing fever, undergoes antigenic variation in its host. Surface-exposed proteins with differing primary structures determine the serotype of each organism. Using amino acid sequence data from two of these variable proteins, we synthesized two mixed-sequence oligonucleotides and then used the oligonucleotides to probe mRNA and DNA of three isogenic serotypes of B. hermsii. In Northern blots the probes were specific for the mRNA of the homologous serotype. Southern blots revealed two classes of hybridizing fragments: those common to the three serotypes and those specific for a particular serotype. A serotype-specific DNA fragment, which had hybridized to both oligonucleotide probes, was cloned. Subsequent use of the cloned fragment as a probe provided further evidence that antigenic variation in B. hermsii is associated with DNA rearrangements and with occurrence of expression-linked copies of all, or part, of an antigen-specifying gene."
https://openalex.org/W1534416515,"When the dose-response curve of adrenocorticotropin (ACTH)-induced aldosterone secretion is compared to that of ACTH-induced intracellular cAMP, the ED50 for intracellular cAMP is more than 10 times as high as that for aldosterone production. In contrast, the dose-response curve of forskolin-induced aldosterone secretion correlates well with that for forskolin-induced intracellular cAMP. ACTH, but not forskolin, increases calcium influx into glomerulosa cells without inducing the mobilization of calcium from an intracellular pool. The effect of ACTH on calcium influx is dose-dependent and ED50 is 3.5 X 10(-11) M. In a perifusion system, the effect of 1 nM ACTH on aldosterone secretion is much greater than that of 1 microM forskolin, even though these two stimulators induce identical increases in the intracellular cAMP. Perifusion with combined A23187 (50 nM) and forskolin (1 microM) stimulates aldosterone secretion to a value comparable to that induced by 1 nM ACTH. Likewise, BAY K 8644 (1 nM), which induces a comparable increase in calcium influx, potentiates the effect of 1 microM forskolin. When the intracellular [Ca2+] is fixed at either 100 or 300 nM, forskolin-stimulated intracellular cAMP content is identical, but ACTH-stimulated intracellular cAMP content at 100 nM [Ca2+]i is 60% of that at 300 nM [Ca2+]i. Both the ACTH- and forskolin-induced aldosterone secretion rate is higher at 300 nM than at 100 nM [Ca2+]i. These results indicate that ACTH stimulates calcium influx, that calcium potentiates ACTH-induced but not forskolin-induced cAMP generation, and that Ca2+ and cAMP act as synarchic messengers in ACTH-mediated aldosterone secretion."
https://openalex.org/W2016028229,"The c-fms proto-oncogene is a member of a gene family that has been implicated in tumorigenesis. Glycoproteins encoded by c-fms were identified in cat spleen cells by means of an immune-complex kinase assay performed with monoclonal antibodies to v-fms-coded epitopes. The major form of the normal cellular glycoprotein has an apparent molecular weight of 170,000 and, like the product of the viral oncogene, serves as a substrate for an associated tyrosine-specific protein kinase activity in vitro. The results suggest that the transforming glycoprotein specified by v-fms is a truncated form of a c-fms-coded growth factor receptor."
https://openalex.org/W1966153972,"We have previously shown linear and circular splicing intermediates resembling intermediates that result from self-splicing of ribosomal precursor RNA of Tetrahymena to be present in mitochondrial RNA. Here we show that splicing of yeast mitochondrial precursor RNA also occurs in vitro in the absence of mitochondrial proteins. The large ribosomal RNA gene, consisting of the intron and part of the flanking exon regions, was inserted behind the SP6 promoter in a recombinant plasmid and was transcribed in vitro. The resulting RNA shows self-catalyzed splicing via incorporation of GTP at the 5'-end of the excised intron, 5'- to 3'-exon ligation, and intron circularization. When purified mitochondrial RNA is incubated under similar conditions with alpha-32P-GTP, the excised ribosomal intron RNA is also labeled, as well as several other RNA species. Some of these RNAs are derived from excised introns from the multiply split gene coding for cytochrome oxidase subunit I."
https://openalex.org/W2044305890,"The helper T cell clone 3H.25 is specific for hen egg white lysozyme and the class II MHC molecule I-Ab. This TH cell has three rearrangements in the β-chain gene family-a Vβ-Dβ-Jpβ1 and a Dβ2-Jβ2 rearrangement on one homolog and a Dβ1-Jβ2 rearrangement on the other. These observations demonstrate that this functional T lymphocyte expresses only a single Vβ gene segment and, accordingly, exhibits allelic exclusion of β-chain gene expression. The rearranged 3H.25 Vβ gene segment is the same as that expressed in a T helper cell specific for cytochrome c and an I-Ek MHC molecule. Thus, there is no simple correlation between the Vβ gene segment and antigen specificity or MHC restriction."
https://openalex.org/W2027955922,"In induced erythroleukemia cells, transcription of the beta-globin gene terminates in a region 600-1500 nucleotides downstream of the poly(A) site. To determine whether this region of the mouse DNA functions to terminate transcription when moved to another genomic site, portions of the putative termination region have been inserted into the E1A transcription unit of the adenovirus (type 5) chromosome. Analysis of RNA labeled either in isolated nuclei or in whole cells early after infection with reconstructed viruses indicated that transcription is terminated if the inserted DNA is oriented in the same direction as in the beta-globin transcription unit and contains the globin poly(A) site plus an additional 1395 nucleotides downstream. In addition to halting transcription within the E1A unit, the insertion of the terminator region had a negative cis effect on the E1B transcription unit, which normally initiates 363 bp downstream of the site of the globin insert. The E1B transcription unit was the only early gene affected, and complementation of the terminator virus with a wild-type E1A gene did not restore transcription of the E1B gene."
https://openalex.org/W1830811929,This paper describes the use of methoxyamine to study the enzymatic reactions catalyzed by uracil-DNA glycosylase and by AP (apurinic/apyrimidinic) endodeoxyribonuclease isolated from mammalian cells. [14C]Methoxyamine permits one to follow the formation of AP sites in a uracil-containing polydeoxyribonucleotide incubated with calf thymus uracil-DNA glycosylase. The number of methoxyamine-reacted AP sites is equal to that of uracil released. Methoxyamine has no effect on the uracil-DNA glycosylase activity and may be added together with the enzyme in order to block the AP sites and prevent the degradation of the polynucleotide by the AP endonucleases that may be present in a crude preparation. Addition of methoxyamine to AP sites prevents not only the enzymatic hydrolysis of the adjacent phosphodiester bond but also the degradation of the polynucleotide by NaOH. This protective effect disappears after methoxyamine is removed by acetaldehyde.
https://openalex.org/W1987563992,"Autoradiography combined with image analysis permitted quantitative visualization of dopamine (D2) and serotonin (S2) binding sites in rat brain. Forebrain sections were incubated with tritiated spiroperidol alone or with tritiated spiroperidol plus unlabeled compounds that saturated the D2 or S2 sites. By subtracting the digitized image of an autoradiograph derived from the latter sections from that of the former, the D2 or S2 sites were specifically revealed. The resulting quantitative images demonstrate the differing anatomical distributions of these sites. The D2 site is largely restricted to the striatal complex (caudate-putamen, nucleus accumbens septi, and olfactory tubercle), whereas the S2 site is enriched in layer 5 of motor cortex, the perirhinal and cingulate cortices, and the claustrum."

https://openalex.org/W1487936580,"We have previously described an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for the quantification of C-1 inactivator-kallikrein complexes in plasma (Lewin, M. F., Kaplan, A. P., and Harpel, P. C. (1983) J. Biol. Chem. 258, 6415-6421). We have now developed an immunoimmobilization-enzyme assay for alpha 2-macroglobulin-kallikrein complexes. In this assay these complexes are removed from plasma by immunoabsorption with the IgG fraction of rabbit anti-alpha 2-macroglobulin antiserum coupled to an agarose gel. The immobilized alpha 2-macroglobulin-kallikrein complex hydrolyzes the fluorogenic substrate D-Ser-Pro-Phe-Arg-7-amino-4-trifluoromethyl coumarin, and this activity is proportional to the concentration of complexes in the plasma. Using these assays we have studied the distribution of plasma kallikrein between its inhibitors under several different experimental conditions. When kallikrein is added to plasma, about 57% binds to C-1 inactivator and 43% to alpha 2-macroglobulin. When prekallikrein is activated endogenously in plasma by the addition of kaolin or Hageman factor fragment, approximately 84% of kallikrein is now bound to C-1 inactivator and 16% to alpha 2-macroglobulin. Temperature dramatically affects the distribution of kallikrein. The binding of kallikrein to alpha 2-macroglobulin in plasma is inversely related to temperature, whereas the binding to C-1 inactivator is directly related: 85% of the kallikrein is bound to alpha 2-macroglobulin at 4 degrees C, whereas at 37 degrees C, only 33% is bound. The total amount of kallikrein bound to the two inhibitors is similar at each temperature. These studies thus provide new insight concerning kallikrein formation and regulation in plasma."

Accumulation of propidium iodide by Purkinje neurons of the vermis was associated with a reproducible behavioral abnormality characterized by truncal tremor, ataxia, and nystagmus. Both the accumulation of propidium iodide in Purkinje cells and the behavioral abnormality were prevented by prior intracerebroventricular administration of ouabain or colchicine, drugs that block neuronal transport processes. The ability of cerebellar Purkinje neurons to extract small and large molecules from the cerebrospinal fluid has important implications for their physiology and pathology."
https://openalex.org/W1589238463,"The human alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) gene was isolated into three overlapping clones in bacteriophage lambda vectors and its sequence organization analyzed by restriction endonuclease mapping and nucleotide sequencing. The human AFP gene is about 20 kilobase pairs long and contains 15 exons and 14 introns. The overall organization of the human AFP gene is similar to that of the mouse AFP gene, with all but two exons showing identical sizes. Nucleotide sequences at all exon/intron junctions display similarity to the consensus boundary sequence (Breathnach, R., and Chambon, P. (1981) Annu. Rev. Biochem. 50, 349-383), with the GT-AG rule applied to the splicing point. The cap site maps 44 nucleotides upstream from the translation initiation site. The is located 27 nucleotides upstream from the putative cap site and is flanked by sequences with dyad symmetry. The TATA box can thus be placed in the loop portion of a possible stem-loop structure formed by intrastrand base-pairing. Other characteristic nucleotide sequences in the 5' flanking region include a CCAAC pentamer, a 14-base pair (bp) enhancer-like sequence, and a 9-bp sequence homologous to the glucocorticoid responsive element. A long (90 bp) direct repeat and several alternating purine/pyrimidine sequences are also present in the 5' flanking region. A 736-bp sequence of the 5' flanking region adjacent to the cap site of the human AFP gene shows a 61% similarity with the corresponding region of the mouse AFP gene. There are two Alu family sequences and two poly(dT-dG) repeats in the human AFP gene that show different distribution patterns from those in the mouse AFP gene."
https://openalex.org/W1506131844,"Insertion of the alpha- and beta-subunits of amphibian epithelial Na+,K+-ATPase into pancreatic microsomes in cell-free systems was shown to be the same as into membranes of intact cells. The glycoproteic beta-subunit was observed to be cotranslationally inserted into endoplasmic reticulum membranes and to adopt a different pattern of N-linked core and terminal sugars in two different amphibian species. The beta-subunit lacks a cleavable signal sequence but quantitative membrane integration required membrane addition at the start of synthesis. Proteolysis of beta-subunit assembled in vitro indicated a cleavable cytoplasmic domain of about 2000 daltons. The catalytic 98-kilodalton alpha-subunit was also membrane-associated during its synthesis in an alkali-resistant fashion and independent of newly synthesized beta-subunit. In contrast to the beta-subunit, membrane integration of the alpha-subunit was possible as late as a time point in its synthesis which corresponded to about 1/3-1/2 of completion of the nascent chain. A small 34 kDa trypsin-resistant fragment of the alpha-subunit was produced at an early stage of synthesis both in the intact cell and in the cell-free system. These results suggest that membrane insertion of both alpha- and beta-subunit occurs during their synthesis but with a different time course."

https://openalex.org/W2047258298,"Both the white mutant allele, wDZL, and the zeste mutant allele, z1, reduce white transcript levels in adult head tissues, but have no effect on these levels in other tested adult tissues. wDZL results from insertion of a complex transposon approximately 5.0 kb 5' to white. Juxtaposition of this transposon to white produces a novel transcription unit beginning in the transposon and producing a mature transcript containing both white and transposon sequences. Head-specific expression of this novel transcription unit correlates with the observed repression of wild-type white transcript levels. wDZL and z1 are known to cause synapsis-dependent repression of w+ expression in trans as assessed by eye pigment deposition. Collectively, these results suggest an unexpected and informative correspondence between cis and synapsis-dependent trans regulatory effects. We discuss the implied mechanistic relationship between regulation of transcription and transvection effects in Drosophila."
https://openalex.org/W1512751283,"To investigate the effect of low density lipoprotein (LDL) heterogeneity on the conformation of LDL apolipoprotein B (apo-B), the immunoreactivities of 6 monoclonal antibodies against LDL apo-B were measured in 3 LDL subfractions isolated by equilibrium density gradient ultracentrifugation. To ensure a broad range of LDL particles, the LDL subfractions were prepared from normal subjects and patients with hyperapobetalipoproteinemia. With 3 of the antibodies, 1D1, 5E11, and 3A10, LDL fractions 1 (the most buoyant), 2 (the intermediate), and 3 (the densest) were equally immunoreactive and competed similarly with reference whole LDL. In contrast, with 3 other antibodies, 2D8, 3F5, and 4G3, fraction 1 was significantly more reactive than fraction 3; that is for each in turn, 290, 250, and 150% more of the densest LDL protein was required to achieve the same displacement as with fraction 1. Further, the immunoreactivities of the 3 LDL fractions with antibodies 2D8, 3F5, and 4G3 were negatively correlated with their LDL cholesterol to LDL protein ratio with r values of 0.727, 0.898, and 0.870, respectively, suggesting that as LDL particle size decreases, the conformation of the LDL apo-B changes progressively. It is of interest that the antigenic determinants recognized by 3F5 and 4G3 are close to the LDL receptor recognition site on LDL apo-B. Therefore, it is possible that the reduced immunoreactivity of these determinants in dense LDL may be the in vitro correlate of the reduced fractional catabolics rate of dense LDL compared to buoyant LDL previously observed in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W1585393120,"The amount of malic enzyme mRNA in total liver RNA increased rapidly when starved ducklings were fed a high-carbohydrate mash diet, reaching 15 times the initial level at 9 h and an apparent steady state, about 20 times the initial level, at 24 h. Based on the kinetics of accumulation, malic enzyme mRNA had a half-life of 3-5 h in the livers of fed ducklings. When fed ducklings were starved, malic enzyme mRNA decreased with a half-life of about 1 h. Feeding, therefore, may have inhibited the degradation of malic enzyme mRNA, but not sufficiently to account for the 20-fold increase in mRNA level. The level of malic enzyme sequences in nuclear RNA increased severalfold when starved ducklings were fed, consistent with a stimulation of transcription. The rate of transcription of the malic enzyme gene, as measured in isolated nuclei, increased 3-5-fold when starved ducklings were refed. Starvation of fed animals caused a 55-65% inhibition of the transcription of the malic enzyme gene. Synthesis of albumin mRNA was little affected by refeeding or starvation, indicating that the observed effects on synthesis of malic enzyme mRNA were selective. We conclude that both increased transcription and decreased degradation contribute to the 20-fold increase in malic enzyme mRNA caused by feeding starved ducklings."

Quantitative hybridization analysis of anaerobic mRNAs using the cDNA clones has shown that there is not a simultaneous accumulation of anaerobic mRNAs. Upon reintroduction of air, the anaerobic mRNAs disappear rapidly and at approximately the same rate. A translocation line that generates progeny that contain 1, 2, and 3 doses of the long arm of chromosome one (1L) allowed us to test for clustering of the anaerobic genes; two of the anaerobic genes tested do not reside with Adh 1 and Phi 1 on the long arm of chromosome 1."

Under these conditions, the cells attached to the tissue culture plates and became polygonal in shape and concurrently shifted their synthesis of collagen from type II to type I subunits. The changes in the levels of the corresponding collagen RNAs in the nucleus and cytoplasm were examined during this shift by dot blot and Northern blot analyses. It was found that the expression of the cartilage collagen gene, alpha 1(II), was controlled at the transcriptional level. While the type I collagen genes may also be partially controlled at the transcriptional level, both genes appear to be transcribed in chondrocyte nuclei although chondrocytes do not synthesize type I collagen. In these chondrocytes, the transcripts of the alpha 2(I) gene are polyadenylated and are apparently exported to the cytoplasm but are not translated."
https://openalex.org/W1483582893,"DNA containing 5-azacytosine is an irreversible inhibitor of DNA(cytosine-5)methyltransferase. This paper describes the binding of DNA methyltransferase to 32P-labeled fragments of DNA containing 5-azacytosine. The complexes were identified by gel electrophoresis. The EcoRII methyltransferase specified by the R15 plasmid was purified from Escherichia coli B(R15). This enzyme methylates the second C in the sequence CCAGG and has a molecular mass of 60,000 Da. Specific binding of enzyme to DNA fragments could be detected if either excess unlabeled DNA or 0.8% sodium dodecyl sulfate was added to the reaction mixture prior to electrophoresis. Binding was dependent upon the presence of both the CCAGG sequence and azacytosine in the DNA fragment. S-Adenosylmethionine stimulated the formation of the complex. The complex was stable to 6 M urea but could be digested with pronase. These DNA fragments could be used to detect the presence of several different methyltransferases in crude extracts of E. coli. No DNA protein complexes could be detected in E. coli B extracts, a strain that contains no DNA(cytosine-5)methyltransferases. The chromosomally determined methylase with the same specificity as the purified EcoRII methylase could be detected in crude extracts of E. coli K12 strains. The MspI methylase cloned in E. coli HB101 could also be detected in crude extracts. These enzymes are the only proteins that bind azacytosine-containing DNA in crude extracts of E. coli."
https://openalex.org/W1531539381,"Incubation of 5-azacytosine-substituted DNA ([5-aza-C]DNA) with nuclear proteins leads to the formation of highly stable DNA . protein complexes which remain intact in the presence of 1 M NaCl and/or 0.6% Sarkosyl. The proteins involved in binding double-stranded [5-aza-C]DNA in these stable complexes comprise a specific subset of non-histone nuclear proteins that includes DNA methyltransferase. Complex formation does not require S-adenosylmethionine and does not involve covalent linkage of protein to DNA or modification of 5-azacytosine residues. Non-histone nuclear proteins do not form complexes with double-stranded unsubstituted DNA that are resistant to dissociation with NaCl and Sarkosyl but are capable of forming such complexes with single-stranded DNA regardless of whether it contains 5-azacytosine residues or not. However, it can be demonstrated 1) that single-stranded regions do not account for stable binding of proteins to native [5-aza-C]DNA and 2) that many nuclear proteins which form stable complexes with single-stranded DNA are incapable of forming such complexes with double-stranded [5-aza-C]DNA. Synthesis of [5-aza-C]DNA by cells growing in the presence of either 5-azacytidine or 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine leads to rapid loss of extractable DNA methyltransferase (Creusot, F., Acs, G., and Christman, J.K. (1982) J. Biol. Chem. 257, 2041-2048). Analogous depletion of non-histone nuclear proteins capable of forming stable complexes with [5-aza-C]DNA in vitro is observed, suggesting that the same proteins can form highly stable complexes with [5-aza-C]DNA in vitro and in vivo. Formation of stable complexes between non-histone nuclear proteins and [5-aza-C]DNA could potentially affect not only the activity of DNA methyltransferase but the action of other regulatory proteins or enzymes that interact with DNA. Such interactions could explain effects of 5-azacytidine on gene expression that cannot be directly linked to loss of methyl groups from DNA."
https://openalex.org/W2030937214,A multiplicity of cytochromes P-450 is responsible for the detoxification and activation of xenobiotics such as drugs and carcinogens. Individual differences in sensitivity to these agents may reside in the cytochrome P-450 phenotype. A monoclonal antibody-directed radioimmunoassay was developed that detects epitope-specific cytochromes P-450 in human placentas and peripheral lymphocytes. Placentas from women who smoked cigarettes contained greater amounts of cytochrome P-450 with the monoclonal antibody-specific epitope than placentas from nonsmokers. The amount of this cytochrome P-450 in human peripheral lymphocytes increased after treatment of the mitogenized lymphocytes with the cytochrome P-450 inducer benz[a]anthracene.
https://openalex.org/W1495181962,"The divalent cation dependence of a calmodulin-stimulated phosphatase from bovine brain has been characterized kinetically using phosphorylated myelin basic protein and casein as substrates. At saturating concentrations of calmodulin, dephosphorylation of both myelin basic protein and casein was catalyzed 8- to 10-fold more rapidly at saturating concentrations of Mn2+ than at saturating concentrations of Ca2+. Half-maximal rates of dephosphorylation of both substrates occurred at either 15 microM Mn2+ or 1 microM Ca2+, and the Kact for each ion was not influenced appreciably by the presence of calmodulin. Half-maximal rates of dephosphorylation were observed at concentrations of calmodulin ranging from 3 X 10(-8) to 10(-6) M at saturating concentrations of divalent cations depending on the substrate used and the particular cation chosen. Trypsin treatment of the phosphatase activated the enzyme several-fold, eliminated its calmodulin dependence, but did not alter the Mn2+ concentration dependence of the activity. Ca2+ (10 microM) increased dephosphorylation rates without altering the Mn2+ concentration dependence of the phosphatase activity regardless of the presence of calmodulin. Mg2+ at millimolar concentrations did not alter the Ca2+ or Mn2+ concentration dependence of the activity. As measured without calmodulin, Ca2+ (90 microM) or Mn2+ (200 microM) produced nearly identical alterations of the far ultraviolet circular dichroic spectrum of the phosphatase."
https://openalex.org/W1597915623,"Cell-free extracts prepared from yeast cells have previously been shown to direct selective and accurate in vitro transcription of tRNA and 5 S RNA genes. We have further analyzed the transcription factors and DNA sequences required for in vitro transcription of the yeast 5 S RNA gene. Fractionation of a yeast extract has identified a 5 S RNA gene-specific factor required, in addition to the two previously described tRNA factors (Klekamp, M. S., and Weil, P. A. (1982) J. Biol. Chem. 257, 8432-8441), for accurate transcription of the 5 S RNA gene by RNA polymerase III. Transcription of variant 5 S RNA genes has indicated that a region of the gene extending from residue +57 to residue +99 is essential for directing specific initiation of transcription. Although the 5' flanking and initial coding sequence is not absolutely required for transcription of the gene, some of the variant genes which have substitutions in this region are less actively transcribed than the wild-type gene. Transcription initiates on some of the variant genes at a position equivalent to +1 in the substituted sequence, while on other variant genes transcription initiates further upstream."
https://openalex.org/W1591102837,"The antigenic regions of the type II regulatory subunit of cAMP-dependent kinase from bovine heart have been correlated with the previously established domain structure of the molecule. Immunoblotting with both serum and monoclonal antibodies of fragments generated by limited proteolysis or chemical cleavage of the R-subunit established that the major antigenic sites were confined to the amino-terminal portion of the polypeptide chain (residues 1-145). Radioimmunoassays using two different antisera suggested that one or more of the high affinity serum antibody recognition sites were further restricted to residues 91-145. This amino-terminal portion of the R-subunit includes the hinge region which is particularly sensitive to proteolysis, allowing the R-subunit to be cleaved readily into a COOH-terminal domain which retains the cAMP-binding sites and an NH2-terminal fragment which appears to be the major site for interaction of the R-subunits in the native dimer. Monoclonal antibodies that recognized determinants on both sides of this hinge region were characterized and their specific recognition sites localized. Accessibility of antigenic sites in the holoenzyme in contrast to free R2 was compared. Although cAMP did tend to slightly increase the affinity of the holoenzyme for one of the monoclonal antibodies, all of the antigenic sites clearly were exposed and accessible in the holoenzyme. Furthermore, despite the presumed close proximity of antigenic sites to interaction sites between the R- and C-subunits, in no case did binding of antibody to the holoenzyme promote dissociation of the complex. The fact that the monoclonal antibodies would precipitate holoenzyme as well as free R2 was used to ascertain the importance of specific amino acid residues in the interaction of the R- and C-subunits. cAMP-binding domains were isolated following limited proteolysis with chymotrypsin and thermolysin. These fragments differed by only three amino acid residues at the NH2-terminal end. U of these fragments in conjunction with immunoadsorption established that the chymotryptic fragment, which contained the Asp-Arg-Arg preceding the site of autophosphorylation, was capable of forming a stable complex with the C-subunit. In contrast, the thermolytic fragment which differed by only those three residues no longer complexed with the C-subunit, indicating that the arginine residues not only contribute to the specificity of the phosphorylation site but also are an essential component for energetically stabilizing the holoenzyme complex."

https://openalex.org/W1485755231,"Morphine 6-dehydrogenase, which catalyzes the dehydrogenation of morphine to morphinone, has been purified about 440-fold from the soluble fraction of guinea pig liver with a yield of 38%. The purified enzyme was a homogeneous protein on polyacrylamide gel disc electrophoresis and isoelectric focusing. The molecular weight and isoelectric point of the enzyme were 29,000 and 7.6, respectively. The enzyme utilizes both NAD and NADP as a cofactor, and the Km values were 0.12 mM for NAD and 0.42 mM for NADP. The Vmax values for morphine were 588 milliunits/mg of protein (with NAD) and 1600 milliunits/mg of protein (with NADP). The Km values for morphine were 0.12 mM (with NAD) and 0.49 mM (with NADP). The enzyme also exhibited activity for morphine-related compounds: nalorphine, normorphine, codeine, and ethylmorphine; however, 7,8-saturated congeners such as dihydromorphine and dihydrocodeine were poor substrates. The enzyme was inactivated by removal of 2-mercaptoethanol from the enzyme solution. The inactivated enzyme was rapidly recovered by the addition of 2-mercaptoethanol. Phenylarsine oxide and CdCl2 (dithiol modifiers) inhibited competitively toward cofactor binding and noncompetitively toward morphine binding. These results suggest that the enzyme possesses the essential thiol groups, probably vicinal dithiol, at or near the cofactor-binding site. Using the partially purified enzyme, 8-(2-hydroxyethylthio)dihydromorphinone was isolated as the product and identified by UV, mass, and NMR spectra. It was confirmed that morphinone proposed as the dehydrogenation product was nonenzymatically and covalently bound to 2-mercaptoethanol. Accordingly, the isolated morphinone-2-mercaptoethanol conjugate must be formed by two steps: enzymatic production of morphinone from morphine and then nonenzymatic binding of 2-mercaptoethanol to morphinone."
https://openalex.org/W2010014006,"Neurospora crassa has at least seven types of 5S RNA genes (α, β, γ, ε, δ, ζ, and η) with different coding regions. A high resolution gel electrophoresis system was developed to separate minor 5S RNA's from the major 5S RNA (α). A study of several Neurospora crassa strains, four other species in the genus Neurospora, members of two closely related genera, and three distantly related genera demonstrated that 5S RNA heterogeneity is common among fungi. In addition, different 5S RNA's are present in Neurospora ribosomes. The finding that fungal ribosomes are structurally heterogeneous suggests that ribosomes may be functionally heterogeneous as well."
https://openalex.org/W1567227887,"The product of the lsp gene of Escherichia coli, i.e. the prolipoprotein signal peptidase, was identified by both in vivo pulse labeling experiments using a high expression lambda PL promoter vector and by an in vitro transcription/translation coupled system. The molecular weight of prolipoprotein signal peptidase was estimated to be approximately 18,000 by its mobility on polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and was found to be the same as that of SPase II purified from the wild-type cells. Analysis of SPase II activities in strains containing various subclones, deletion derivatives generated from plasmid pMT521, and analysis of protein products in a strain harboring an ileS-lsp-fused gene indicated that ileS and lsp genes are transcribed on the same mRNA. This was further supported by the observation that Tn5 insertions in the ileS gene resulted in a reduced expression of the lsp gene. In addition to an upstream promoter shared by the ileS and lsp genes, these analyses also revealed the presence of an internal promoter for the lsp gene within the coding region of the ileS gene."
https://openalex.org/W1492986550,"An azidonitrophenylaminoacetyl mono[125I]iodoapamin derivative was prepared which showed specific binding to rat neuronal membranes. UV photolysis lead to the irreversible occupation of binding sites. Photo-labeling of intact primary cultured rat neurones followed by membrane solubilization, sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and autoradiography revealed the covalent incorporation of radioactivity into 3 main components with Mr = 86,000, 30,000, and 23,000. Labeling was completely prevented by a competing excess of native apamin. Similar studies on purified synaptic membranes from the rat brain showed another labeling pattern with major bands corresponding to Mr = 86,000 and 59,000. Although the reasons for the partial discrepancy between cultured embryonic neurons and an adult brain membrane fraction are not yet clear, we conclude that these proteins are intimately associated with the apamin binding site and are probably components of a type of Ca2+-activated K+ channel."
https://openalex.org/W95617521,"The cleavage by bleomycin-Fe(II) complex in the presence of dithiothreitol of 3‘-or 5‘-end-labeled DNA from the region of the bacteriophage G4 origin of complementary strand synthesis was investigated by using the DNA-sequencing technique. Bleomycin cleaved a single-stranded DNA substrate preferentially at inverted repeat sequences, which potentially form stem-and-loop structures, while it cleaved double-stranded DNA substrates with different specificity. The results support the formation of three adjoining stem-and-loop structures in the region of the phage G4 origin of complementary strand synthesis under the low-salt conditions used and suggest a difference in the form of the double helix between the stem and the double-stranded DNA fragment. Bleomycin appears to be a useful reagent for searching stem-and-loop structures. The results may also contribute to the understanding of the mode of action of bleomycin as an antitumor antibiotic."
https://openalex.org/W1515797922,"Three different 15-kilobase rat genomic clones that contained sequences colinear with U3 RNA were isolated. These inserts hybridized only to U3 RNA in a mixture of total cellular 4-8 S RNA labeled in vivo which showed that genes or pseudogenes for most other small RNAs were absent in these U3 DNA clones. DNA sequence analysis showed that the three subcloned genes contained full-length U3-coding sequences but each had sequence variations, insertions, and/or deletions when compared to rat U3A or U3B RNA. Two of these pseudogenes contained poly(A) sequences on the 3'-end and were flanked by 6-15-nucleotide long direct repeats. None of the three clones was transcribed when injected into Xenopus oocyte nuclei. One clone was a template for a small RNA slightly larger than U3 RNA, but this transcript was not related to the U3 RNA sequences. The structural features of two of these three U3 DNAs are supportive of the hypothesis that some pseudogenes arose from RNA-mediated DNA synthesis and insertion into the genome at random sites (Van Arsdell, S. W., Denison, R.A., Bernstein, L.B., Weiner, A.M., Manser, T., and Gesteland, R.F. (1981) Cell 26, 11-20). This is the first instance where full-length, colinear, U3 RNA pseudogenes have been isolated and characterized."
https://openalex.org/W1531229183,"We have investigated the possibility that cellular control of membrane excitability involves feedback mechanisms in which the degree of activity of voltage-sensitive Na+ channels regulates the number of these channels. Using two independent assays, channel-mediated Na+ uptake and the specific binding of [3H] saxitoxin, we have studied the effects of pharmacological activation of Na+ channels with batrachotoxin (BTX) on the number and properties of these channels. Upon exposure of cultured muscle cells to BTX (1 microM), the number of surface Na+ channels decreases by approximately 75%, with a half-time of 3-6 h. This decrease is prevented by pharmacological blockade of these channels and does not reflect changes in the apparent affinities towards either BTX or saxitoxin. This reduction is reversible: a gradual increase in surface Na+ channels that is dependent on protein synthesis is observed upon removal of the activator. The BTX-induced decrease in Na+ channels is associated with an enhanced rate of disappearance of surface Na+ channels. These findings point to the existence of a down-regulation mechanism for the modulation of membrane excitability under conditions of elevated Na+ channel activity."
https://openalex.org/W1480479350,"Guinea pig seminal vesicle epithelium synthesizes and secretes large amounts of four secretory proteins including a basic protein designated SVP-1. The latter migrates as a protein of 25 kDa by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. When total cellular RNA from seminal vesicle epithelium was translated in vitro by a rabbit reticulocyte system, SVP-1 was not identifiable as a product. In contrast, a major product of the reticulocyte system was a 55-kDa protein which paradoxically could not be identified as one of the four known secretory proteins or as an abundant tissue protein. We isolated a cDNA clone which corresponded to the mRNA which coded for the 55-kDa protein. The mRNA was 1800 bases and of very high abundance; only the transcripts corresponding to the major secretory proteins SVP-3 and SVP-4 were as conspicuous. From these observations, we decided to test whether the 55-kDa protein was related to SVP-1. The 55-kDa protein was found to share properties of SVP-1, including an alkaline pI and selection by antibody against SVP-1. After proteolytic digestion of the 55-kDa protein, one fragment co-migrated with authentic SVP-1. Furthermore, detectable fragments of the 55-kDa protein smaller than SVP-1 all co-migrated with fragments generated from the proteolytic digestion of SVP-1. Finally, we show that the 55-kDa protein could be processed in vitro by seminal vesicle lumenal extracts to yield a 30-kDa protein and a protein the size of native SVP-1. The best explanation of our results is that the 55-kDa protein represents the primary translation product and precursor of SVP-1. Our proteolytic mapping and in vitro processing studies are consistent with the idea that the 55-kDa protein is a tandem repeat of two SVP-1 molecules. We used the cDNA clone to study the expression of the corresponding gene in different states of androgen depletion and repletion."
https://openalex.org/W1563048833,"Nine hybridoma clones producing antibodies against the Escherichia coli cAMP receptor protein (CRP) have been isolated. Five of the monoclonal antibodies (Class I) had a much higher affinity for native CRP while the remaining four (Class II) bound equally well to native or denatured CRP. Using native N-terminal CRP cores, it was shown that none of the Class I monoclonal antibodies cross-reacted with the 15,000-Da CRP core, and only two bound to the 18,800-Da CRP core. The positions of the antigenic determinants for the Class II monoclonal antibodies were found by Western blotting analysis to reside in the N-proximal region of CRP. Only one monoclonal antibody strongly inhibited cAMP binding by CRP, and this was accompanied by a consequent strong inhibition of both lac DNA binding and abortive initiation by RNA polymerase. Each of the Class I monoclonal antibodies inhibited abortive initiation, and four of these antibodies also blocked the binding of cAMP X CRP to the lac DNA fragment. One Class I and one Class II monoclonal antibody bound to the cAMP X CRP X DNA complex. Two of the Class II monoclonal antibodies were without apparent effect on any of the assays used."
https://openalex.org/W1552859051,"Dopamine stimulates a 7-10-fold increase of GTP concentration in whole rat retina maintained in vitro. Half-maximal stimulation of GTP levels were obtained with 10(-6) M dopamine, and significant increases in GTP levels were seen with 10(-7) M dopamine. Intracellular GTP levels were significantly increased within 4 min after exposure to dopamine and maximal effects were reached within 30 min. Dopamine agonists, apomorphine and bromocriptine, also stimulate a 7-10-fold increase in GTP concentration, whereas other catecholamines (norepinephrine, epinephrine, and isoproterenol) were less potent. Several other neurotransmitters present in rat retina (gamma-aminobutyric acid, glycine, glutamine, and taurine) had no effect on GTP levels. Although dopamine also stimulates increases in cyclic AMP levels in the retina, dibutyryl cyclic AMP and 8-bromo-cyclic AMP had no effect on GTP levels, indicating that the dopamine-stimulated increase of GTP is independent of the catalytic production of cyclic AMP by adenylate cyclase. Since dopamine-stimulated adenylate cyclase activity requires GTP, the dopamine-stimulated increase in GTP concentration described in this report may serve to facilitate dopamine stimulation of adenylate cyclase activity."
