https://openalex.org/W2267670880,"Batteries based on sodium superoxide and on potassium superoxide have recently been reported. However, there have been no reports of a battery based on lithium superoxide (LiO2), despite much research into the lithium-oxygen (Li-O2) battery because of its potential high energy density. Several studies of Li-O2 batteries have found evidence of LiO2 being formed as one component of the discharge product along with lithium peroxide (Li2O2). In addition, theoretical calculations have indicated that some forms of LiO2 may have a long lifetime. These studies also suggest that it might be possible to form LiO2 alone for use in a battery. However, solid LiO2 has been difficult to synthesize in pure form because it is thermodynamically unstable with respect to disproportionation, giving Li2O2 (refs 19, 20). Here we show that crystalline LiO2 can be stabilized in a Li-O2 battery by using a suitable graphene-based cathode. Various characterization techniques reveal no evidence for the presence of Li2O2. A novel templating growth mechanism involving the use of iridium nanoparticles on the cathode surface may be responsible for the growth of crystalline LiO2. Our results demonstrate that the LiO2 formed in the Li-O2 battery is stable enough for the battery to be repeatedly charged and discharged with a very low charge potential (about 3.2 volts). We anticipate that this discovery will lead to methods of synthesizing and stabilizing LiO2, which could open the way to high-energy-density batteries based on LiO2 as well as to other possible uses of this compound, such as oxygen storage."

https://openalex.org/W2214441024,"Despite the widespread interest in direct neuronal reprogramming, the mechanisms underpinning fate conversion remain largely unknown. Our study revealed a critical time point after which cells either successfully convert into neurons or succumb to cell death. Co-transduction with Bcl-2 greatly improved negotiation of this critical point by faster neuronal differentiation. Surprisingly, mutants with reduced or no affinity for Bax demonstrated that Bcl-2 exerts this effect by an apoptosis-independent mechanism. Consistent with a caspase-independent role, ferroptosis inhibitors potently increased neuronal reprogramming by inhibiting lipid peroxidation occurring during fate conversion. Genome-wide expression analysis confirmed that treatments promoting neuronal reprogramming elicit an anti-oxidative stress response. Importantly, co-expression of Bcl-2 and anti-oxidative treatments leads to an unprecedented improvement in glial-to-neuron conversion after traumatic brain injury in vivo, underscoring the relevance of these pathways in cellular reprograming irrespective of cell type in vitro and in vivo."

Comorbidities, nutritional status, biomarkers of inflammation and GFR were assessed.GFR was the dominant variable affecting TMAO (β = -0.41; p<0.001), choline (β = -0.38; p<0.001), and betaine (β = 0.45; p<0.001) levels. A longitudinal study of 74 CKD 5 patients starting renal replacement therapy demonstrated that whereas dialysis treatment did not affect TMAO, Rtx reduced levels of TMAO to that of controls (p<0.001). Following Rtx choline and betaine levels continued to increase. In CKD 3-5, TMAO levels were associated with IL-6 (Rho = 0.42; p<0.0001), fibrinogen (Rho = 0.43; p<0.0001) and hsCRP (Rho = 0.17; p = 0.022). Higher TMAO levels were associated with an increased risk for all-cause mortality that remained significant after multivariate adjustment (HR 4.32, 95% CI 1.32-14.2; p = 0.016).Elevated TMAO levels are strongly associated with degree of renal function in CKD and normalize after renal transplantation. TMAO levels correlates with increased systemic inflammation and is an independent predictor of mortality in CKD 3-5 patients."
https://openalex.org/W2228189109,"The ventro-lateral pulvinar is reciprocally connected with the visual areas of the ventral stream that are important for object recognition. To understand the mechanisms of attentive stimulus processing in this pulvinar-cortex loop, we investigated the interactions between the pulvinar, area V4, and IT cortex in a spatial-attention task. Sensory processing and the influence of attention in the pulvinar appeared to reflect its cortical inputs. However, pulvinar deactivation led to a reduction of attentional effects on firing rates and gamma synchrony in V4, a reduction of sensory-evoked responses and overall gamma coherence within V4, and severe behavioral deficits in the affected portion of the visual field. Conversely, pulvinar deactivation caused an increase in low-frequency cortical oscillations, often associated with inattention or sleep. Thus, cortical interactions with the ventro-lateral pulvinar are necessary for normal attention and sensory processing and for maintaining the cortex in an active state."
https://openalex.org/W2206908694,"MicroRNA maturation is initiated by RNase III DROSHA that cleaves the stem loop of primary microRNA. DROSHA functions together with its cofactor DGCR8 in a heterotrimeric complex known as Microprocessor. Here, we report the X-ray structure of DROSHA in complex with the C-terminal helix of DGCR8. We find that DROSHA contains two DGCR8-binding sites, one on each RNase III domain (RIIID), which mediate the assembly of Microprocessor. The overall structure of DROSHA is surprisingly similar to that of Dicer despite no sequence homology apart from the C-terminal part, suggesting that DROSHA may have evolved from a Dicer homolog. DROSHA exhibits unique features, including non-canonical zinc-finger motifs, a long insertion in the first RIIID, and the kinked link between Connector helix and RIIID, which explains the 11-bp-measuring ""ruler"" activity of DROSHA. Our study implicates the evolutionary origin of DROSHA and elucidates the molecular basis of Microprocessor assembly and primary microRNA processing."

https://openalex.org/W2238949050,"In mouse embryonic stem cells converted to an epiblast fate in vitro—a state in which the cells can also gain germ cell fate if exposed to the signalling molecule BMP4—the sole expression of the transcription factor NANOG is shown to be sufficient to induce germ cell fate, in the absence of BMP4. The transcription factor gene Nanog is expressed both in pluripotent cells and in primordial germ cells in mice, but its function in germ cells has not been defined. Azim Surani and colleagues find that in embryonic stem cells converted to an epiblast fate in vitro, a state in which they can also gain germ cell fate if exposed to the signalling molecule BMP4, sole expression of Nanog is sufficient to induce germ cell fate in the absence of BMP4. They demonstrate that the resetting of the chromatin that occurred in the primed epiblast allows NANOG to bind and activate the expression of key germ cell factors. The pluripotent factor Sox2 prevents the action of Nanog on these germ cell factors in the epiblast state, while SOX2 and NANOG work together to maintain pluripotency in naive embryonic stem cells. Nanog, a core pluripotency factor in the inner cell mass of blastocysts, is also expressed in unipotent primordial germ cells (PGCs) in mice1, where its precise role is yet unclear2,3,4. We investigated this in an in vitro model, in which naive pluripotent embryonic stem (ES) cells cultured in basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) and activin A develop as epiblast-like cells (EpiLCs) and gain competence for a PGC-like fate5. Consequently, bone morphogenetic protein 4 (BMP4), or ectopic expression of key germline transcription factors Prdm1, Prdm14 and Tfap2c, directly induce PGC-like cells (PGCLCs) in EpiLCs, but not in ES cells6,7,8. Here we report an unexpected discovery that Nanog alone can induce PGCLCs in EpiLCs, independently of BMP4. We propose that after the dissolution of the naive ES-cell pluripotency network during establishment of EpiLCs9,10, the epigenome is reset for cell fate determination. Indeed, we found genome-wide changes in NANOG-binding patterns between ES cells and EpiLCs, indicating epigenetic resetting of regulatory elements. Accordingly, we show that NANOG can bind and activate enhancers of Prdm1 and Prdm14 in EpiLCs in vitro; BLIMP1 (encoded by Prdm1) then directly induces Tfap2c. Furthermore, while SOX2 and NANOG promote the pluripotent state in ES cells, they show contrasting roles in EpiLCs, as Sox2 specifically represses PGCLC induction by Nanog. This study demonstrates a broadly applicable mechanistic principle for how cells acquire competence for cell fate determination, resulting in the context-dependent roles of key transcription factors during development."
https://openalex.org/W2229873423,"Embryonic neocortical development depends on balanced production of progenitors and neurons. Genetic mutations disrupting progenitor mitosis frequently impair neurogenesis; however, the link between altered mitosis and cell fate remains poorly understood. Here we demonstrate that prolonged mitosis of radial glial progenitors directly alters neuronal fate specification and progeny viability. Live imaging of progenitors from a neurogenesis mutant, Magoh(+/-), reveals that mitotic delay significantly correlates with preferential production of neurons instead of progenitors, as well as apoptotic progeny. Independently, two pharmacological approaches reveal a causal relationship between mitotic delay and progeny fate. As mitotic duration increases, progenitors produce substantially more apoptotic progeny or neurons. We show that apoptosis, but not differentiation, is p53 dependent, demonstrating that these are distinct outcomes of mitotic delay. Together our findings reveal that prolonged mitosis is sufficient to alter fates of radial glia progeny and define a new paradigm to understand how mitosis perturbations underlie brain size disorders such as microcephaly."
https://openalex.org/W2229474614,"Several neuropsychiatric disorders are associated with cognitive and social dysfunction. Postmortem studies of patients with schizophrenia have revealed specific changes in area CA2, a long-overlooked region of the hippocampus recently found to be critical for social memory formation. To examine how area CA2 is altered in psychiatric illness, we used the Df(16)A+/− mouse model of the 22q11.2 microdeletion, a genetic risk factor for developing several neuropsychiatric disorders, including schizophrenia. We report several age-dependent CA2 alterations: a decrease in the density of parvalbumin-expressing interneurons, a reduction in the amount of feedforward inhibition, and a change in CA2 pyramidal-neuron intrinsic properties. Furthermore, we found that area CA2 is less plastic in Df(16)A+/− mice, making it nearly impossible to evoke action potential firing in CA2 pyramidal neurons. Finally, we show that Df(16)A+/− mice display impaired social cognition, providing a potential mechanism and a neural substrate for this impairment in psychiatric disorders."
https://openalex.org/W2222970579,"Individuals sometimes show inconsistent risk preferences, including excessive attraction to gambles featuring small chances of winning large amounts (called ""positively skewed"" gambles). While functional neuroimaging research indicates that nucleus accumbens (NAcc) and anterior insula (AIns) activity inversely predict risky choice, structural connections between these regions have not been described in humans. By combining diffusion-weighted MRI with tractography, we identified the anatomical trajectory of white-matter tracts projecting from the AIns to the NAcc and statistically validated these tracts using Linear Fascicle Evaluation (LiFE) and virtual lesions. Coherence of the right AIns-NAcc tract correlated with reduced preferences for positively skewed gambles. Further, diminished NAcc activity during gamble presentation mediated the association between tract structure and choice. These results identify an unreported tract connecting the AIns to the NAcc in humans and support the notion that structural connections can alter behavior by influencing brain activity as individuals weigh uncertain gains against uncertain losses."
https://openalex.org/W2222141405,"Although age-related loss of chromosome Y (LOY) in normal hematopoietic cells is a well-known phenomenon, the phenotypic consequences of LOY have been elusive. However, LOY has been found in association with smoking, shorter survival and higher risk of cancer. It was suggested that LOY in blood cells could become a predictive biomarker of male carcinogenesis.To investigate the association of LOY in blood cells with the risk for development of colorectal (CC) and prostate cancers (PC), we have analyzed DNA samples from peripheral blood of 101 CC male patients (mean age 60.5±11.9 yrs), 70 PC patients (mean age 68.8±8.0 yrs) and 93 healthy control males (mean age 65.8±16.6 yrs). The methodology included co-amplification of homologous sequences on chromosome Y and other chromosomes using multiplex quantitative fluorescent (QF) PCR followed by automatic detection and analysis on ABI 3500 Genetic Analyzer. The mean Y/X ratio was significantly lower in the whole group of cancer patients (0.907±0.12; p = 1.17x10-9) in comparison to the controls (1.015±0.15), as well as in CC (0.884±0.15; p = 3.76x10-9) and PC patients (0.941±0.06; p = 0.00012), when analyzed separately. Multivariate logistic regression analysis adjusting for LOY and age showed that LOY is a more significant predictor of cancer presence than age, and that age probably does not contribute to the increased number of subjects with detectable LOY in cancer patients cohort.In conclusion, our results support the recent findings of association of LOY in blood cells with carcinogenesis in males."

Mouse peri-implantation development (E4.5–E7.5) is characterized by dynamic cellular transitions that involve major switches in transcriptional and epigenetic programs, resulting in the activation and repression of numerous genes and regulatory elements (Buecker et al., 2014Buecker C.

Pre-implantation epiblast (E4.5) cells can give rise to all embryonic lineages, including the germline, and are considered to display a naive or ground pluripotent state (Hackett and Surani, 2014Hackett J.A.

Upon implantation, epiblast cells transit to a primed state (E5.5–7.5), characterized by a partial extinction of the naive pluripotency program and the incipient expression of somatic germ layer specifiers (Kalkan and Smith, 2014Kalkan T. Smith A. Mapping the route from naive pluripotency to lineage specification.Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 2014; 369: 20130540Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Although most of the post-implantation epiblast progresses toward somatic differentiation, a few cells in its proximal-posterior end undergo major reprogramming events, leading to primordial germ cell (PGC) specification (∼E6–6.5) (Hayashi et al., 2011Hayashi K.

Mouse peri-implantation development is difficult to study in vivo because of the scarcity and transient nature of the involved cell populations. This can be overcome by using mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) grown under different growth-factor conditions as in vitro models (Hackett and Surani, 2014Hackett J.A. Surani M.A. Regulatory principles of pluripotency: from the ground state up.Cell Stem Cell. 2014; 15: 416-430Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar, Kalkan and Smith, 2014Kalkan T. Smith A. Mapping the route from naive pluripotency to lineage specification.Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 2014; 369: 20130540Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Under “serum+LIF” (SL), mESCs display heterogeneity and metastability, with a majority of cells residing in a naive state that can reversibly switch to a primed one. The naive state can be more faithfully recapitulated by growing mESCs under “2i+LIF” (Ying et al., 2008Ying Q.-L. Wray J. Nichols J. Batlle-Morera L. Doble B. Woodgett J. Cohen P. Smith A. The ground state of embryonic stem cell self-renewal.Nature. 2008; 453: 519-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (2534) Google Scholar). Primed pluripotency is represented in vitro by epiblast-like cells (EpiLCs) and epiblast stem cells (EpiSCs), which resemble the pre-gastrulating and gastrulating post-implantation epiblast, respectively (Hayashi et al., 2011Hayashi K.

Moreover, PGC-like cells (PGCLCs) can be induced from EpiLCs, opening the possibility to investigate the transcriptional and epigenetic changes underlying PGC specification (Hayashi et al., 2011Hayashi K.

The transcriptional regulatory network that maintains the ground pluripotent state consists of a set of “core” (Oct4/Pou5f1, Sox2) and “ancillary” (Esrrb, Nanog, Tbx3, Prdm14) transcription factors (TFs) that cooperatively establish a broad set of enhancers (Chen et al., 2008Chen X.

The progression from naive to primed pluripotency involves and likely requires the dismantling of the naive gene expression program (Kalkan and Smith, 2014Kalkan T. Smith A. Mapping the route from naive pluripotency to lineage specification.Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 2014; 369: 20130540Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). However, the repressors mediating this gene silencing process remain poorly characterized. One potential candidate is Foxd3, a member of the forkhead family of TFs required to maintain pluripotency both in vivo and in vitro (Hanna et al., 2002Hanna L.A. Foreman R.K. Tarasenko I.A. Kessler D.S. Labosky P.A.

Regulation of embryonic stem cell self-renewal and pluripotency by Foxd3.Stem Cells. 2008; 26: 2475-2484Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) that has been suggested to preferentially act as a repressor (Yaklichkin et al., 2007Yaklichkin S. Steiner A.B. Lu Q. Kessler D.S. FoxD3 and Grg4 physically interact to repress transcription and induce mesoderm in Xenopus.J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 2548-2557Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Foxd3−/− pre-implantation embryos appear morphologically normal but die soon after implantation because of a loss of epiblast cells (Hanna et al., 2002Hanna L.A. Foreman R.K. Tarasenko I.A. Kessler D.S. Labosky P.A. Requirement for Foxd3 in maintaining pluripotent cells of the early mouse embryo.Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 2650-2661Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar), suggesting that Foxd3 might be most critical during the progression from naive to primed pluripotency. Here we show that Foxd3 dismantles a significant fraction of the naive expression program through the decommissioning of active enhancers, thus being required to exit naive pluripotency and to reach the primed pluripotent state. Subsequently, Foxd3 needs to be silenced in EpiLCs in order to efficiently differentiate these cells into PGCLCs, therefore uncovering de-repression as an important regulatory mechanism during the acquisition of germline identity. In order to uncover genes regulated by Foxd3 in mESCs, we performed gain- and loss-of-function experiments in cells grown under SL conditions. First, we used a previously established mESC line (i.e., Foxd3fl/fl;Cre-ER) in which Foxd3 can be deleted upon tamoxifen (TM) treatment (Figures S1A and S1B) (Liu and Labosky, 2008Liu Y. Labosky P.A. Regulation of embryonic stem cell self-renewal and pluripotency by Foxd3.Stem Cells. 2008; 26: 2475-2484Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) to identify, by RNA sequencing (RNA-seq), genes misexpressed upon loss of Foxd3 (Figure 1A). We observed that Foxd3 repressed almost four times as many genes as it activated (767 upregulated versus 205 downregulated genes) (Data S1). In addition, we generated a mESC line (i.e., tetOn Foxd3) in which Foxd3 can be overexpressed in a doxycycline (Dox)-inducible manner (Figures S1C and S1D). Using RNA-seq, we observed similar number of genes being repressed or activated by Foxd3 overexpression (1,197 downregulated versus 1,017 upregulated genes) (Figure 1B; Data S1). However, the concordance between the expression changes elicited by either loss or overexpression of Foxd3 was especially significant among genes repressed by Foxd3 (p = 8.1 × 10−85) (Figures 1C and S1E). RNA-seq results were validated by reverse-transcriptase quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) (Figures S1F and S1G) and by the significant overlaps observed between genes found as misexpressed in our and previous studies in Foxd3−/− and Foxd3 overexpressing mESCs (Figures S1H and S1I). To further investigate if, as the previous results suggest, Foxd3 acts mostly as a repressor in mESCs, we used chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) to globally map Foxd3 genomic occupancy. Because of the lack of commercial antibodies suitable for ChIP (Supplemental Experimental Procedures), we generated a mESC line constitutively expressing Flag-HA tagged Foxd3 (i.e., FH-Foxd3) at nearly endogenous levels (Figures S1J and S1K). ChIP-seq using anti-HA and anti-Flag antibodies resulted in the identification of 2,496 genomic regions considered as bound by Foxd3 in both ChIP-seq experiments (Figures 1D and S1L; Data S2). ChIP-seq specificity was validated (Figures S1M and S1N) and highlighted by the significant overrepresentation of the Foxd3 consensus binding sequence among the identified Foxd3-bound genomic regions (Figure 1E). The 2,496 Foxd3-bound regions were assigned to 2,865 nearby genes using GREAT (McLean et al., 2010McLean C.Y. Bristor D. Hiller M. Clarke S.L. Schaar B.T. Lowe C.B. Wenger A.M. Bejerano G. GREAT improves functional interpretation of cis-regulatory regions.Nat. Biotechnol. 2010; 28: 495-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (2491) Google Scholar) (Data S2). To confirm the validity of these assignments, we used mESC topological associating domain (TAD) maps and found that ∼90% of the Foxd3-bound regions and their associated genes were within the same TAD (Dixon et al., 2012Dixon J.R. Selvaraj S. Yue F. Kim A. Li Y. Shen Y. Hu M. Liu J.S. Ren B. Topological domains in mammalian genomes identified by analysis of chromatin interactions.Nature. 2012; 485: 376-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (3955) Google Scholar). Importantly, genes repressed by Foxd3, but not activated ones, were bound by Foxd3 significantly more than expected by chance (p = 9.2 × 10−7 versus p = 0.40) (Figure 1F). Our results indicate that in SL mESCs, Foxd3 preferentially represses its target genes and that gene activation might be due to secondary indirect effects. Manual inspection of genes repressed by Foxd3 revealed several naive pluripotency regulators preferentially expressed in the pre-implantation epiblast (e.g., Dppa3, Tbx3, Prdm14, Pramel6/7) (Hayashi et al., 2011Hayashi K. Ohta H. Kurimoto K. Aramaki S. Saitou M. Reconstitution of the mouse germ cell specification pathway in culture by pluripotent stem cells.Cell. 2011; 146: 519-532Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (918) Google Scholar). Furthermore, Foxd3 did not affect the expression of core pluripotency TFs (e.g., Oct4, Sox2) or of all naive pluripotency genes (e.g., Nanog, Esrrb, Klf4) (Figures 1A, 1B, S1F, and S1G). To investigate if Foxd3 had a similar regulatory role when mESCs were maintained under naive conditions, we performed RNA-seq in mESCs adapted to “2i+LIF” (Data S1). Overall, there were significant similarities between the expression changes occurring upon loss of Foxd3 in mESCs grown under SL and 2i (Figures S2A and S2B). Moreover, under 2i, Foxd3 also preferentially acted as a transcriptional repressor (Figure S2C). These preliminary observations suggest that Foxd3 could promote exit from naive pluripotency through the direct repression of key naive pluripotency regulators. To substantiate this hypothesis, we used available transcriptome profiles generated during the differentiation of 2i embryonic stem cells (ESCs) toward EpiLCs (Hayashi et al., 2011Hayashi K. Ohta H. Kurimoto K. Aramaki S. Saitou M. Reconstitution of the mouse germ cell specification pathway in culture by pluripotent stem cells.Cell. 2011; 146: 519-532Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (918) Google Scholar). Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) showed that the set of genes most significantly downregulated during the transition from 2i ESCs to EpiLCs was globally repressed by Foxd3 in SL and 2i mESCs (Figures 2A, S2D, and S2E; Tables S1 and S2), while genes upregulated during such transition were globally induced (Figure S2F, Table S1). Similar correlations were observed when Foxd3 target genes were compared with those genes that changed their expression between 2i ESCs and the pre-gastrulating mouse epiblast (Table S1) (Hayashi et al., 2011Hayashi K. Ohta H. Kurimoto K. Aramaki S. Saitou M. Reconstitution of the mouse germ cell specification pathway in culture by pluripotent stem cells.Cell. 2011; 146: 519-532Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (918) Google Scholar). Moreover, Foxd3 was significantly upregulated in EpiLCs and the pre-gastrulating epiblast compared with 2i ESCs (Hayashi et al., 2011Hayashi K. Ohta H. Kurimoto K. Aramaki S. Saitou M. Reconstitution of the mouse germ cell specification pathway in culture by pluripotent stem cells.Cell. 2011; 146: 519-532Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (918) Google Scholar) (Figure S3A). In order to directly address if Foxd3 plays a central role during exit from naive pluripotency, we adapted Foxd3fl/fl;Cre-ER cells to “2i+LIF,” treated them with TM for 3 days, and then performed the differentiation toward EpiLCs. Compared with untreated cells, which after 2 days displayed the typical morphological features of EpiLCs (Buecker et al., 2014Buecker C. Srinivasan R. Wu Z. Calo E. Acampora D. Faial T. Simeone A.

Nevertheless, we collected the few Foxd3−/− cells that remained attached after EpiLC differentiation and evaluated the expression of a panel of relevant genes (Figure 2C). Foxd3−/− cells were unable to silence naive pluripotency genes representing direct Foxd3 targets (e.g., Tbx3, Prdm14, Tfap2c, Pramel6/7), while other naive and core pluripotency regulators showed normal expression dynamics (e.g., Esrrb, Nanog, Pou5f1). Moreover, Foxd3−/− cells failed to upregulate early post-implantation gene markers (e.g., Dntm3b, Otx2, Pou3f1) (Figure 2C). To test if the failure of Foxd3−/− cells to differentiate into EpiLCs could be the result of an initially abnormal state, we repeated the previous experiments with Foxd3fl/fl;Cre-ER cells pre-treated with TM for only 12 hr (Figure S3B). Under these conditions, the expression of most analyzed genes was barely changed when differentiation was started (0 hr) (Figure S3C). Nevertheless, after 2 days, most TM-treated cells either died or failed to acquire EpiLC morphological and molecular features (Figures S3B and S3C). The specificity of the phenotypic defects observed in Foxd3−/− cells was confirmed by performing experiments in which transient overexpression of Foxd3 in these cells significantly restored their differentiation potential (Figure S3D). The extensive cell death observed in Foxd3−/− mESCs upon EpiLC differentiation could indicate that, in addition to the silencing of naive pluripotency genes, a major role of Foxd3 during this cellular transition could be to increase cell survival in primed pluripotent cells, which are characterized by a low apoptotic threshold (Pernaute et al., 2014Pernaute B. Spruce T. Smith K.M. Sánchez-Nieto J.M. Manzanares M. Cobb B. Rodríguez T.A. MicroRNAs control the apoptotic threshold in primed pluripotent stem cells through regulation of BIM.Genes Dev. 2014; 28: 1873-1878Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). In agreement with this, Gene Ontology analysis of genes upregulated in Foxd3−/− mESCs revealed a significant overrepresentation of pro-apoptotic genes (Figure S3E). To confirm that Foxd3 contributes to exit from naive pluripotency through repression of the naive pluripotency expression program, we performed commitment assays in which Foxd3fl/fl;Cre-ER 2i mESCs treated with TM were differentiated toward EpiLCs and then re-plated into “2i+LIF” (Figure 2D). EpiLC differentiation was extended to 3 days, because by this time most cells are committed to differentiate and have lost their naive pluripotency properties (Leeb et al., 2014Leeb M. Dietmann S. Paramor M. Niwa H. Smith A. Genetic exploration of the exit from self-renewal using haploid embryonic stem cells.Cell Stem Cell. 2014; 14: 385-393Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Foxd3fl/fl EpiLCs could not be re-adapted to “2i+LIF” condition, as they either died or appeared differentiated after 48 hr (Figure 2D) and formed, almost exclusively, differentiated alkaline phosphatase-negative colonies upon passaging. In stark contrast, the surviving Foxd3−/− cells generated mostly naive-like colonies after being re-plated into “2i+LIF,” were able to proliferate, could be maintained for at least two or three passages, and formed alkaline phosphatase-positive colonies (Figures 2D and S3F). The transition from 2i ESCs into EpiLCs involves passaging and a change in growth factor and substrate conditions. Because all these factors could contribute to the incapacity of Foxd3−/− cells to exit the naive state, we treated Foxd3fl/fl;Cre-ER cells with TM for 3 days and then induced exit from naive pluripotency by simply removing LIF and 2i inhibitors (Betschinger et al., 2013Betschinger J. Nichols J. Dietmann S. Corrin P.D. Paddison P.J. Smith A. Exit from pluripotency is gated by intracellular redistribution of the bHLH transcription factor Tfe3.Cell. 2013; 153: 335-347Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar, Leeb et al., 2014Leeb M.

Genetic exploration of the exit from self-renewal using haploid embryonic stem cells.Cell Stem Cell. 2014; 14: 385-393Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Similarly to EpiLC differentiation, Foxd3 was rapidly upregulated upon release from “2i+LIF” (Figure S3G). Within 24 hr, a large fraction of Foxd3−/− cells appeared as floating dying cells (∼90% dead cells on the basis of trypan blue staining). Those that remained attached did not show morphological or molecular features indicative of an exit from naive pluripotency (Figures S3H and S3I). The previous experiments were then repeated using Foxd3fl/fl;Cre-ER cells treated with TM for 12 hr before the release from “2i+LIF.” On the basis of trypan blue staining, ∼30% and ∼50% of Foxd3−/− cells died 24 and 48 hr after the release from “2i+LIF,” respectively. Although cell death was higher than in untreated Foxd3fl/fl cells (∼10% and ∼15% dead cells 24 and 48 hr after the release from “2i+LIF”), it was nevertheless considerably lower than the ∼90% dead cells observed 24 hr after the release from “2i+LIF” when cells were pre-treated with TM for 3 days. Thus, following a short pre-treatment with TM, cell survival and exit from naive pluripotency became temporally decoupled, as cell death was reduced during the first 48 hr after the release from “2i+LIF,” becoming conspicuous again only after 72 hr (Figure 2E). After 48 hr, Foxd3−/− cells formed naive-like colonies (Figure 2E) and expressed naive pluripotency regulators at higher levels than untreated controls (Figure 2F). When overexpressed in SL mESCs, Foxd3 led not only to the repression of naive pluripotency genes but also to the induction of primed pluripotency ones (Figure 1B), suggesting that Foxd3 overexpression could be sufficient to drive mESCs out of the naive pluripotent state. However, Foxd3 overexpression in tetOn Foxd3 cells adapted to “2i+LIF” did not result in any evident morphological changes (data not shown), indicating that additional intrinsic and/or extrinsic regulatory factors are required for the transition to a primed pluripotent state. To further explore this idea, tetOn Foxd3 cells were cultured in “2i+LIF” medium supplemented with serum (Figure S3J). Under these conditions, Foxd3 overexpression resulted in phenotypic and molecular changes suggestive of a transition to a primed-like pluripotent state, including repression of naive pluripotency genes and increased expression of several, but not all, primed pluripotency markers (e.g., Dnmt3b, Lefty1, Nes) (Figures S3J and S3K). Overall, our results suggest that Foxd3 provides a permissive state, characterized by the dismantling of the naive pluripotency expression program, in which other intrinsic (e.g., Otx2) and extrinsic factors (e.g., Fgf/Erk, Activin/Nodal) with instructive regulatory functions can promote the transition to primed pluripotency (Betschinger et al., 2013Betschinger J.

https://openalex.org/W2226953621,"The identification of extracellular vesicles (EVs) as intercellular conveyors of biological information has recently emerged as a novel paradigm in signaling, leading to the exploitation of EVs and their contents as biomarkers of various diseases. However, whether there are diurnal variations in the size, number, and tissue of origin of blood EVs is currently not known, and could have significant implications when using EVs as biomarkers for disease progression. Currently available technologies for the measurement of EV size and number are either time consuming, require specialized equipment, or lack sufficient accuracy across a range of EV sizes. Flow cytometry represents an attractive alternative to these methods; however, traditional flow cytometers are only capable of measuring particles down to 500 nm, which is significantly larger than the average and median sizes of plasma EVs. Utilizing a Beckman Coulter MoFlo XDP flow cytometer with NanoView module, we employed nanoscale flow cytometry (termed nanoFCM) to examine the relative number and scatter distribution of plasma EVs at three different time points during the day in 6 healthy adults. Analysis of liposomes and plasma EVs proved that nanoFCM is capable of detecting biologically-relevant vesicles down to 100 nm in size. With this high resolution configuration, we observed variations in the relative size (FSC/SSC distributions) and concentration (proportions) of EVs in healthy adult plasma across the course of a day, suggesting that there are diurnal variations in the number and size distribution of circulating EV populations. The use of nanoFCM provides a valuable tool for the study of EVs in both health and disease; however, additional refinement of nanoscale flow cytometric methods is needed for use of these instruments for quantitative particle counting and sizing. Furthermore, larger scale studies are necessary to more clearly define the diurnal variations in circulating EVs, and thus further inform their use as biomarkers for disease."
https://openalex.org/W2227884484,"Offshore platforms are known to act as artificial reefs, though there is on-going debate on whether this effect is beneficial or harmful for the life in the surrounding marine environment. Knowing what species exist on and around the offshore platforms and what environmental variables influence this species assemblage is crucial for a better understanding of the impact of offshore platforms on marine life. Information on this is limited for offshore platforms in the southern North Sea. This study aims to fill this gap in our knowledge and to determine how the composition and the abundance of species assemblages changes with depth and along a distance-from-shore gradient. The species assemblages on five offshore gas platforms in the southern North Sea have been inventoried using Remotely Operated Vehicles inspection footage. A total of 30 taxa were identified. A Generalised Additive Model of the species richness showed a significant non-linear relation with water depth (p = 0.001): from a low richness in shallow waters it increases with depth until 15–20 m, after which richness decreases again. Using PERMANOVA, water depth (p≤0.001), community age (p≤0.001) and the interaction between distance from shore and community age (p≤0.001) showed a significant effect on the species assemblages. Future research should focus on the effect additional environmental variables have on the species assemblages."
https://openalex.org/W2236257352,"Background and Aims EASL/AASLD hepatic encephalopathy (HE) guidelines proposed the alternative use of the term ‘Covert HE’ combining minimal HE (mHE) and Grade 1 HE into a single entity. However, longitudinal data to indicate that these are indeed a single entity are lacking. The aims of this study were to determine whether the occurrence of complications of cirrhosis requiring hospital admission and mortality were similar in these sub-groups of patients. Methods Clinically-stable cirrhotic patients (n = 106) with no previous history of ‘Overt HE’ were included over a 2-year period and classified as having no HE (n = 23), mHE (n = 39) or Grade 1 HE (n = 44). Standard biochemistry, venous ammonia, bacterial DNA and neutrophil function were measured at inclusion and the patients were followed for a mean of 230±95 days. Results Patients with Grade 1 HE had significantly more complications requiring hospitalisation (infection 9/18/34%; HE 4/8/18%; other 13/10/11%; P = 0.02) and significantly greater mortality (4/5/20%; P = 0.04) compared to patients with no HE or mHE respectively. Patients with mHE and grade 1 HE had similar ammonia levels, but higher than the no HE group (P<0.001). MELD score was similar between groups but Grade 1 HE patients had increased frequency of bacterial translocation (P = 0.06) and neutrophil spontaneous respiratory burst (P = 0.02) compared to patients with mHE. Conclusions The results of this study show for the first time that ‘Covert HE’ is a heterogeneous entity with significantly greater hospitalisations and mortality in the Grade 1 HE patients compared with mHE. Further prospective longer-term studies are required before EASL/AASLD guidance is fully implemented."

Aim To examine the consistency between FSL, FreeSurfer, SPM for GM atrophy measurement (for volumes, patient/control discrimination, and correlations with cognition). Materials and Methods 127 MS patients and 50 controls were included and cortical and deep grey matter (DGM) volumetrics were performed. Consistency of volumes was assessed with Intraclass Correlation Coefficient/ICC. Consistency of patients/controls discrimination was assessed with Cohen’s d, t-tests, MANOVA and a penalized double-loop logistic classifier. Consistency of association with cognition was assessed with Pearson correlation coefficient and ANOVA. Voxel-based morphometry (SPM-VBM and FSL-VBM) and vertex-wise FreeSurfer were used for group-level comparisons. Results The highest volumetry ICC were between SPM and FreeSurfer for cortical regions, and the lowest between SPM and FreeSurfer for DGM. The caudate nucleus and temporal lobes had high consistency between all software, while amygdala had lowest volumetric consistency. Consistency of patients/controls discrimination was largest in the DGM for all software, especially for thalamus and pallidum. The penalized double-loop logistic classifier most often selected the thalamus, pallidum and amygdala for all software. FSL yielded the largest number of significant correlations. DGM yielded stronger correlations with cognition than cortical volumes. Bilateral putamen and left insula volumes correlated with cognition using all methods. Conclusion GM volumes from FreeSurfer, FSL and SPM are different, especially for cortical regions. While group-level separation between MS and controls is comparable, correlations between regional GM volumes and clinical/cognitive variables in MS should be cautiously interpreted."

The aim of this study was to investigate chemical profile and stated biological activities of the supercritical CO2 extract (SCE) of old man’s beard compared to the extracts obtained using the conventional techniques (Soxhlet extracts and macerate). The most abundant compound identified was usnic acid, which content was inversely proportional to the polarity of the solvent used and was the highest in the SCE, which was the sample revealing the highest cytotoxic activity in tested tumor cell lines (B16 mouse melanoma and C6 rat glioma), with lower IC50 values compared to pure usnic acid. Further investigations suggested both SCE and usnic acid to induce apoptosis and/or autophagy in B16 and C6, indicating higher cytotoxicity of SCE to be related to the higher degree of ROS production. A good correlation of usnic acid content in the extracts and their antioxidant capacity was established, extricating SCE as the most active one.

https://openalex.org/W2223825126,"Control of bovine tuberculosis (bTB) and zoonotic tuberculosis (zTB) has relied upon surveillance and slaughter of infected cattle, milk pasteurisation and public health education. In Cameroon, like many other sub-Saharan African countries, there is limited understanding of current cattle husbandry or milk processing practices or livestock keepers awareness of bTB. This paper describes husbandry and milk processing practices within different Cameroonian cattle keeping communities and bTB awareness in comparison to other infectious diseases.A population based cross-sectional sample of herdsmen and a questionnaire were used to gather data from pastoralists and dairy farmers in the North West Region and Vina Division of Cameroon.Pastoralists were predominately male Fulanis who had kept cattle for over a decade. Dairy farmers were non-Fulani and nearly half were female. Pastoralists went on transhumance with their cattle and came into contact with other herds and potential wildlife reservoirs of bTB. Dairy farmers housed their cattle and had little contact with other herds or wildlife. Pastoralists were aware of bTB and other infectious diseases such as foot-and-mouth disease and fasciolosis. These pastoralists were also able to identify clinical signs of these diseases. A similar proportion of dairy farmers were aware of bTB but fewer were aware of foot-and-mouth and fasciolosis. In general, dairy farmers were unable to identify any clinical signs for any of these diseases. Importantly most pastoralists and dairy farmers were unaware that bTB could be transmitted to people by consuming milk.Current cattle husbandry practices make the control of bTB in cattle challenging especially in mobile pastoralist herds. Routine test and slaughter control in dairy herds would be tractable but would have profound impact on dairy farmer livelihoods. Prevention of transmission in milk offers the best approach for human risk mitigation in Cameroon but requires strategies that improved risk awareness amongst producers and consumers."
https://openalex.org/W2226348845,"Stem cells respond to nanoscale, microscale, and macroscale cues, such as matrix, growth factors, and niche organization, which are difficult to physiologically recapitulate in culture. We discuss how utilizing bioengineering approaches to manipulate and integrate spatiotemporal cues across these discrete length scales can improve traditional methods for controlling cell fate. Stem cells respond to nanoscale, microscale, and macroscale cues, such as matrix, growth factors, and niche organization, which are difficult to physiologically recapitulate in culture. We discuss how utilizing bioengineering approaches to manipulate and integrate spatiotemporal cues across these discrete length scales can improve traditional methods for controlling cell fate. Circumstances dictate an individual’s sensitivity and responsiveness to his or her environment; this statement is equally true for a stem cell. In recent decades, pioneering research has elucidated how stem cells respond to their direct microenvironment. A key finding from these experiments is that stem cell behavior is dictated by the integration of signals that occur across multiple spatial and temporal scales (Figure 1). Despite numerous breakthroughs in our understanding of the biological cues that drive cell behavior, the commonly used in vitro platforms for culturing stem cells and studying their behavior have remained mostly unchanged. In this Forum article, we advocate for the integration and use of multiscale bioengineered constructs, which intentionally incorporate nanoscale, microscale, and macroscale features, into stem cell culture systems. Specifically, we argue that engineering specific aspects of the stem cell microenvironment across these length scales provides advantages for efficiently culturing stem cells and directing their behavior. Conventional in vitro experimentation involves the removal of stem cells from their natural and biologically complex environment and culturing them in artificial systems such as 2D tissue culture dishes or simple hydrogels, which lack the complexity of the endogenous stem cell niche. Most often, non-physiological concentrations of stem cells are seeded on top of stiff tissue culture plastics to form monolayers that are covered with a disproportional volume of culture medium, leading to rapid dilution of secreted factors. These artificial environments are prone to causing aberrant stem cell behavior, and many in vitro findings are unique to the experimental settings in which they are performed. For example, hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) have the ability to self-renew extensively in vivo, while only having limited self-renewal capacity in vitro. We argue that developing and integrating novel technologies to control cellular environments at multiple length scales will help to align stem cell behavior in vitro and in vivo. In vivo, stem cell behavior is directed across multiple length scales (Figure 1). For example, gradients of molecules, local substrate stiffness, nanoscale architecture of the surrounding matrix, microscale spatial arrangement of cells relative to their neighbors, and physiological crosstalk between organs jointly orchestrate cell behavior. Furthermore, stem cell microenvironments are naturally dynamic, necessitating temporal control to truly mimic niches in vitro. Thus, incorporating dynamically controllable multiscale features into in vitro environments provides significant opportunities to improve stem cell culture systems. Although major advances in engineering materials for stem cell culture platforms have been reported, these approaches often focus on manipulating single and specific aspects of the microenvironment. For example, tunable hydrogels with user-defined stiffness for directing lineage commitment during differentiation, controlled-release approaches for delivering soluble factors, or patterned substrates to control cellular architecture offer useful solutions to specific questions, but provide limited control over other factors. Instead, integrating multiple approaches to coordinate multiparametric control of culture environments provides an enhanced ability to control stem cell behavior (Figure 2A). Although historically appreciated, such integration may finally be possible due to the many recent advances made in both the biological and bioengineering communities. Here, we provide our perspectives on the emerging directions provided by various multiscale bioengineering approaches, particularly with respect to advances in biomaterials and biofabrication techniques, which will enable the development of the next generation of stem cell culture platforms. Cells are presented with a relatively static environment in many tissue culture systems. This absence of temporal control provides challenges for recapitulating the dynamic nature of natural tissues in vitro. Recently, several extraordinary biomaterials whose properties, for example stiffness, can be altered dynamically have been reported. These biomaterials are useful tools for addressing unresolved questions about the influence of microenvironment stiffness on the behavior of stem cells during wound healing, embryonic development, or cancer progression. For example, a recent study reporting on the development of a hydrogel with temporally controllable stiffness revealed that stem cells possess a mechanical memory of their past physical environments, which affected their future cell fate decisions (Yang et al., 2014Yang C. Tibbitt M.W. Basta L. Anseth K.S. Nat. Mater. 2014; 13: 645-652Crossref PubMed Scopus (718) Google Scholar). When tuned to possess a stiffness of 10 kPa, this culture substrate activated yes-associated protein (YAP) in human mesenchymal stem cells and induced osteogenic induction. YAP nuclear translocation was reversed when the hydrogel was photolytically degraded to provide a softer elasticity of 2 kPa. However, prolonged culturing on the stiff hydrogel led to irreversible YAP activation. This remarkable finding emphasizes that continuous control over the stem cell’s environment is highly desirable to achieve more predictive and controllable outcomes. This discovery also indicates that some of the currently used in vitro stem cell culture systems may intrinsically alter cell fate directions. For example, isolating stem cells by adhesion to plastic culture dishes could potentially alter their behavior. Thus, hydrogels with dynamically adjustable stiffness present an exciting opportunity to continuously and optimally direct stem cell behavior. Exciting advances in dynamic regulation of other factors in stem cell culture systems have also been recently reported. Novel biomaterials have been recently developed that allow induced presentation of peptides, following exposure to an external stimulus such as a change in temperature, electromagnetic field, or light. Recently, the inducible expression of the adhesion peptide RGD was achieved via a chemical modification with photolytic 3-(4,5-dimethoxy-2-nitrophenyl)-2-butyl ester, which effectively caged the peptide until exposure to UV (350–365 nm) light (Lee et al., 2015Lee T.T. García J.R. Paez J.I. Singh A. Phelps E.A. Weis S. Shafiq Z. Shekaran A. Del Campo A. García A.J. Nat. Mater. 2015; 14: 352-360Crossref Scopus (335) Google Scholar). As a demonstration of the applicability of this system, the caged RGDs were incorporated into a hydrogel that could be transdermally activated to uncage the RGD domains (Figure 2B). Following subcutaneous implantation, dynamic presentation of RGD by the biomaterial promoted enhanced cell adhesion at wound sites, as well as vascular invasion, and mitigated fibrous encapsulation of the implanted material that might otherwise block regenerative responses. The ability to dynamically regulate the expression of bioactive factors represents a major advancement toward engineering dynamic stem cell environments. Numerous protocols, such as the differentiation of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), typically rely on multistep and time-sensitive sub-protocols that require subjecting cells to a regime of timed growth factor supplementation. This approach is effective for cell monolayers but less so for 3D cultures due to lower rates of diffusion, and it is generally incompatible with in vivo manipulation of experimental cell populations. Therefore, temporal control through inducible expression of bioactive elements could drive the translation of current 2D protocols into clinically relevant 3D approaches. Furthermore, this methodology for dynamic control of cell culture components could be expanded beyond peptides to release other types of molecules, for instance drugs, or to regulate gene expression through activation of RNAi and CRISPR-Cas9 systems. In addition to temporal cues, spatial cues encompassing nanoscale to microscale features play a crucial role in tissue organization and behavior. While many 3D culture systems, such as hydrogels, provide environments that aim to mimic the chemical composition of the native extracellular matrix (ECM), these systems do not recapitulate the spatial heterogeneity of the cellular microenvironment. In vivo, tissue microarchitectures contain directionality, gradients, and unique compositions, often in a repetitive manner that regulates function. We therefore argue that the integration of spatial heterogeneity will yield more natural environments for directing stem cell fate decisions. Bioengineers have developed several relatively facile approaches designed to control the spatial placement of biomaterials, bioactive cues, or cells. All of these approaches present environments that improve control over stem cell behavior. In one example, aggregates of induced pluripotent stem cell-derived hepatocytes were patterned in an array of pyramid-shaped microwells (Stevens et al., 2013Stevens K.R. Ungrin M.D. Schwartz R.E. Ng S. Carvalho B. Christine K.S. Chaturvedi R.R. Li C.Y. Zandstra P.W. Chen C.S. Bhatia S.N. Nat. Commun. 2013; 4: 1847Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). The resulting microtissues were retrieved when the microwells were filled with hydrogel, which was subsequently crosslinked, detached from the microwells, and cultured further, generating engineered tissues up to centimeters in diameter. Microtissues derived from different cell types can be layered to create complex tissues with additional levels of spatial organization, and these multiscale manipulations allow thorough investigation of the effects of cell placement and density on the function of the engineered tissues, as well as analysis of mixed, juxtaposed, and paracrine co-cultures (Figure 2C). These design parameters are inherent to stem cell microniches but were previously often difficult or labor intensive to investigate or even discern in vitro. In addition to defined placement of cells, spatial positioning of distinct biomaterials around individual stem cells or cell aggregates can be used to introduce asymmetrical environments and induce changes in cell polarity and differentiation. This was demonstrated by encapsulating embryoid bodies at the interface of two distinct hydrogels (Qi et al., 2010Qi H. Du Y. Wang L. Kaji H. Bae H. Khademhosseini A. Adv. Mater. 2010; 22: 5276-5281Crossref Scopus (98) Google Scholar) to induce discrete differentiation patterns in defined regions of the same cell aggregate. This approach can be used to model several embryological processes ranging from early events such as blastocyst polarization to later events such as limb formation. Patterning ligands within a single biomaterial is another method for specifying spatial organization. This can be achieved by using patterned light to conjugate photosensitive molecules to materials or surfaces. Although this often generates a static environment, a recent study reported a reversible strategy for the spatiotemporal patterning of bioactive elements using an allyl sulfide modified hydrogel (Gandavarapu et al., 2014Gandavarapu N.R. Azagarsamy M.A. Anseth K.S. Adv. Mater. 2014; 26: 2521-2526Crossref Scopus (104) Google Scholar). This culture system allows the patterned attachment, removal, and reattachment of biochemical ligands. We predict that methodologies such as this, which integrate spatial and temporal cues, will likely prove instrumental to more precisely control stem cell fate decisions. In particular, this general approach will be of great value for studies that aim to explore changes in cellular behaviors or phenotypes, such as cancer development or stem cell differentiation. Importantly, it can be argued that an engineered environment with tunable spatial and temporal control transforms the investigator from an observer into an experimenter with active control over the culture environment. Cell cultures can also be patterned at the macroscale level, in addition to the patterning techniques discussed above. 3D printing is exceptionally well-suited to produce complex biological macrostructures (Figure 2D). Hydrogels can be deposited in patterns to form biological structures that would not otherwise be possible, such as trabeculated embryonic hearts (Hinton et al., 2015Hinton T.J. Jallerat Q. Palchesko R.N. Park J.H. Grodzicki M.S. Shue H.J. Ramadan M.H. Hudson A.R. Feinberg A.W. Sci. Adv. 2015; 1: e1500758Crossref Scopus (976) Google Scholar). By combining 3D printing with a multi-nozzle approach, complex co-cultures displaying anatomical organization can be created. For example, trabecular long bone containing stem-cell-laden bone marrow compartments might be produced with such approaches. Continued development and integration of multiscale patterning techniques therefore may provide rich opportunities to generate and study structures in vitro that anatomically, and perhaps functionally, resemble physiological organs. Despite the many advances in engineering biomaterials for culturing stem cells, most of these biomaterials do not mimic the nanoscale architecture of natural ECM. Membrane proteins enable cells to sense, interact, and respond to their biochemical and biophysical environment at the nanometer scale. In fact, stem cells have been shown to respond to features as small as 8 nm, and the absence of precise nanoscale cues in vitro may contribute to inefficiency in controlling stem cell behavior in such artificial environments. The nanoscale elements of the ECM, such as directionality, orientation, and nanotopography of individual fibers, can direct stem cell attachment, alignment, migration, and differentiation through altering focal-adhesion-mediated mechanotransduction. This lesson can be applied to stem cell culture systems by incorporating organized arrays of micropatterns and nanopatterns on 2D substrates or 3D microfibers and nanofibers (Nandakumar et al., 2013Nandakumar A. Truckenmüller R. Ahmed M. Damanik F. Santos D.R. Auffermann N. de Boer J. Habibovic P. van Blitterswijk C. Moroni L. Small. 2013; 9: 3405-3409Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) (Figure 2E). We anticipate that the use of engineered nanofibrilar materials constructed with molecular precision will enable a range of novel applications. Peptide structures can be engineered to promote self-assembly into nanofibers with tunable biomechanical and biochemical signaling properties in user-defined patterns, with nanoscale precision. For example, DNA nanotubes can be functionalized to present bioactive peptides. This approach allows the uncoupled tuning of the biomaterial’s nano-architecture and peptide-based bioactivity to synergistically and simultaneously control and probe stem cell behavior (Stephanopoulos et al., 2015Stephanopoulos N. Freeman R. North H.A. Sur S. Jeong S.J. Tantakitti F. Kessler J.A. Stupp S.I. Nano Lett. 2015; 15: 603-609Crossref Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Another emerging avenue of research is the generation of multiscale topographies at microscales and nanoscales. Such hybrid approaches provide another level of physical control over stem cell behavior through the integration of custom-designed features. The development of advanced tools that move beyond population-level analyses and provide information at the single-cell level are required for us to develop a deeper understanding of individual stem cell fate decisions. Integrating complementary techniques to gain multiscale spatiotemporal control over a single cell’s microenvironment would allow controlled fabrication of complex, functional, and biomimetic tissues in which stem cell behavior could be studied at this depth of resolution. Doing so, however, demands systematic high-throughput analyses to assess large numbers of cells, due to cellular heterogeneity and the desire to study responses across a large number of integrated culture conditions. Many high-throughput screening platforms rely on the formation of stem-cell-laden micromaterials using spotting, stamping, or microfluidic droplet-generating techniques. Although some advanced high-throughput screening systems can query stem cells within artificial environments with single-cell resolution (Gobaa et al., 2011Gobaa S. Hoehnel S. Roccio M. Negro A. Kobel S. Lutolf M.P. Nat. Methods. 2011; 8: 949-955Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar), they analyze a relatively low number of biomarkers, which has limited our comprehensive understanding of individual stem cell behavior. To address this need, droplet microfluidics has been used to enable the affordable and simultaneous RNA-seq analysis of tens of thousands of individual stem cells (Klein et al., 2015Klein A.M. Mazutis L. Akartuna I. Tallapragada N. Veres A. Li V. Peshkin L. Weitz D.A. Kirschner M.W. Cell. 2015; 161: 1187-1201Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1870) Google Scholar). Genetic barcoding of cDNA isolated from each cell was accomplished in nanoliter droplets, and the resulting libraries were multiplexed and sequenced to provide detailed insights into stem cell behavior at extremely fine resolution. This approach might be adapted to simultaneously screen molecular responses of single stem cells in a library of multiscale microgels. This level of systematically mapping the effects of multiscale cellular environments at the single-cell level would represent a major breakthrough not only for regenerative medicine, but also for the in vitro testing of pharmaceuticals and many other applications. As more advanced tools and approaches to manipulate stem cells in vitro are developed, rapid integration and widespread adoption of such methodologies within the stem cell research community remain key challenges. This will be dependent on the acceptance and availability of such platforms and an understanding of the level of control and knowledge they can provide. Leveraging these platforms will require individuals and research teams to possess multi-disciplinary expertise in cell biology, chemistry, engineering, and materials science. To this end, the ongoing convergence of life sciences, physical sciences, and engineering will play a crucial role. Such shifts toward big science may benefit from the formation of larger and joint academic departments, research consortia, and funding opportunities. Manufacturing many of the culture systems discussed in this Forum article currently requires acquisition or access to costly equipment or dedicated infrastructure. The transition toward cost-effective, robust, and facile approaches with low-cost thresholds is likely to expedite the rapid adoption of technologies that produce multiscale bioengineered constructs and promote their early adoption by a larger number of stem cell biologists. In turn, this may facilitate moving away from 2D culture platforms and usher in new methodologies for culturing stem cells, techniques for manipulating their fate, and directions for promoting regenerative medicine and human health.

Mechanisms determining selective vulnerability of neurons in neurodegeneration remain enigmatic. Identification and precise understanding of those mechanisms will provide immense insights into the pathophysiology of neurodegenerative diseases (NDs) as well as benefit the development of therapeutic targets. Spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 (SCA1) is a fatal, progressive autosomal ND whereby cerebellar Purkinje cells (PCs) selectively degenerate (Bürk et al., 1996Bürk K. Abele M. Fetter M. Dichgans J.

SCA1 is caused by an abnormal expansion of an unstable CAG trinucleotide repeat tract in exon 8 of ATXN1, causing an expanded polyglutamine tract in the Ataxin-1 protein (Banfi et al., 1994Banfi S. Servadio A. Chung M.Y. Kwiatkowski Jr., T.J. McCall A.E. Duvick L.A. Shen Y. Roth E.J. Orr H.T. Zoghbi H.Y. Identification and characterization of the gene causing type 1 spinocerebellar ataxia.Nat.

Despite the ubiquitous expression of the mutant protein in the CNS, selective degeneration of cerebellar PCs, complemented with losses in the brain stem and spinocerebellar tracts, are the predominant hallmarks of the pathology (Zoghbi and Orr, 1995Zoghbi H.Y. Orr H.T. Spinocerebellar ataxia type 1.Semin. Cell Biol. 1995; 6: 29-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Knockin mice harboring an expansion of 154 CAG repeats in the endogenous mouse locus (Sca1154Q/2Q) ubiquitously express mutant Ataxin-1 and develop progressive neurodegeneration closely resembling the human SCA1 disease (Watase et al., 2002Watase K.

Studies using SCA1 mice models elucidated that PC loss in the cerebellum occurred late in disease, and early macroscopically visible symptoms could not be accounted for by PC degeneration alone (Clark et al., 1997Clark H.B. Burright E.N. Yunis W.S. Larson S. Wilcox C. Hartman B. Matilla A. Zoghbi H.Y. Orr H.T.

The B05 mouse model, in which human Ataxin-1 harboring 82 polyglutamine repeats is overexpressed within PCs, allowed the identification of the physiological as well as the pathological role of Ataxin-1. Mainly, the interaction of Ataxin-1 with important transcription factors and RNA (Lam et al., 2006Lam Y.C. Bowman A.B. Jafar-Nejad P. Lim J. Richman R. Fryer J.D. Hyun E.D. Duvick L.A. Orr H.T.

Gene profiling experiments done on B05 mice demonstrated that mutant mice exhibit altered expression profiles for genes involved in glutamate signaling and calcium homeostasis (Lin et al., 2000Lin X.

Subsequently, it was found that the polyglutamine elongation in Ataxin-1 destabilizes RORα, an important transcriptional factor required for PC and cerebellar development (Harding et al., 1997Harding H.P. Atkins G.B. Jaffe A.B. Seo W.J. Lazar M.A. Transcriptional activation and repression by RORalpha, an orphan nuclear receptor required for cerebellar development.Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 1737-1746PubMed Google Scholar). The loss of RORα-mediated gene expression during development is an important determinant for PC vulnerability in SCA1 (Serra et al., 2006Serra H.G. Duvick L. Zu T. Carlson K. Stevens S. Jorgensen N. Lysholm A. Burright E. Zoghbi H.Y. Clark H.B. et al.RORalpha-mediated Purkinje cell development determines disease severity in adult SCA1 mice.Cell. 2006; 127: 697-708Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Further, synaptic inputs onto PCs arising from climbing fibers (CFs) are altered, leading to reduced CF-PC synaptic strength and concomitant alterations in PC excitability, which correlate with mutant Ataxin-1 expression. Alterations in parallel fiber (PF)-PC synapses were not observed at presymptomatic stages (Barnes et al., 2011Barnes J.A. Ebner B.A. Duvick L.A. Gao W. Chen G. Orr H.T. Ebner T.J.

Neurosci. 2013; 33: 5806-5820Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), suggesting the existence of selectively vulnerable components within the cerebellar circuit. However, the molecular pathways and mechanisms associated with CF impairments, as well as the consequences of these alterations in PCs and their impact on disease progression, remain unclear. Here, we set out to determine the molecular alterations in mutant PCs and the relationship of these changes with respect to impaired synaptic inputs and dysfunctional PC excitation in SCA1. Using a mass spectrometry (MS)-based approach to examine the proteome of disease-vulnerable PCs and disease-resistant granule cells (GCs) at presymptomatic stage, we identified disease-specific PC alterations in synaptic proteins. Focusing on Homer-3, a PC-specific scaffold protein, we found that its expression was diminished early in disease and was a consequence of reduced mTORC1 signaling. Electrophysiological measurements revealed impaired CF-PC synapse functionality, and administration of glutamatergic signaling modulators suggested that reduced mTORC1 and Homer-3 levels reflected altered PC activation responses. Further, PC-specific genetic ablation of mTORC1 or pharmacological inhibition of mTORC1 confirmed Homer-3 as a downstream target of mTORC1 signaling. Inhibiting mTORC1 expression in Sca1154Q/2Q PCs exacerbated disease pathology, providing evidence for the involvement of mTORC1 signaling and Homer-3 in the spatiotemporal aspects of disease. Conversely, adeno-associated virus (AAV)-mediated expression of Homer-3 in Sca1154Q/2Q mice delayed disease hallmarks and improved behavioral outcome. We identify mTORC1 signaling and Homer-3 as important components influencing the clinical manifestations and progression of disease in SCA1 mouse model. The first measurable pathology in Sca1154Q/2Q arises by the fifth postnatal week (Watase et al., 2002Watase K. Weeber E.J. Xu B. Antalffy B. Yuva-Paylor L. Hashimoto K. Kano M. Atkinson R. Sun Y. Armstrong D.L. et al.A long CAG repeat in the mouse Sca1 locus replicates SCA1 features and reveals the impact of protein solubility on selective neurodegeneration.Neuron. 2002; 34: 905-919Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar), right after the critical period for cerebellar maturation. Here, we focused on identifying the cellular processes which would be altered at this early age. We compared the total cerebellar proteome of wild-type (WT) and Sca1154Q/2Q mice at post-natal day P35 by MS. A total of 675 proteins were detected and shared between both genotypes. Only proteins with a minimum PMSS (protein match score summation) of 30 and 3 or more unique peptides and detected in 2 separate experiments were analyzed. Of the 675 proteins detected, 85% remained unchanged, suggesting a high degree of reliability in our approach (Figure 1A). This semiquantitative analysis revealed an altered proteome; 68 proteins were upregulated and 32 were downregulated at least 2-fold. PANTHER (protein analysis through evolutionary relationships) revealed an enrichment for proteins belonging to diverse classes such as oxidoreductases, membrane-associated trafficking proteins, calcium-binding proteins, chaperones, etc. (Figure S1A). We validated some of these alterations by immunostaining; a representative example for increased expression of Synaptophysin and Excitatory Amino Acid Transporter 1 (EEAT1) in Sca1154Q/2Q mice is shown in (Figures S1B and S1C). We next aimed to identify specific alterations within the PC proteome by laser dissecting groups of PCs from the most affected cerebellar lobules VIII-X from P35, WT, and Sca1154Q/2Q mice. In parallel, from the same sections, groups of GCs from lobules VIII-X were collected and MS analysis was performed. Enrichment analysis for neuron-specific markers such as Calbindin, VGluT1, Parvalbumin, and Calretinin validated the purity of the extracted cellular proteomes (Figure S1D). Because GCs resist disease until end stage, we hypothesized that alterations within the PC proteome that were not observed within GCs might not only elucidate PC-specific alterations but also provide clues to early disease-associated changes. MS analysis revealed that 31% of Sca1154Q/2Q PC proteome was significantly altered compared to WT (Figure 1A). An overrepresentation analysis on the proteins altered in PCs revealed significant enrichment for calcium-binding and membrane-trafficking proteins. The most significant molecular pathway altered in PCs was related to synaptic vesicle trafficking (Figure 1B). Interestingly, the large majority of detected calcium-binding proteins involved in regulating calcium dynamics were downregulated in Sca1154Q/2Q PCs (Figure 1C). These included Calmodulin, Hippocalcin-like protein 1, neuron-specific calcium-binding proteins, Calreticulin, and serine/threonine-protein phosphatase 2A/B catalytic subunit alpha isoform (Figure 1D). Further, proteins localized to the synapse and involved in synaptic vesicle priming, vesicle exocytosis, and synaptic transmission were significantly reduced in Sca1154Q/2Q (Figure 1D). A comparison between alterations within the total cerebellar proteome and PC-specific proteome revealed four conserved alterations: neuromodulin, glutamate receptor delta-2 subunit (GluD2), Homer-3, and vesicle-associated membrane protein 2 (VAMP-2) (Figure 1E). Moreover, the alterations identified were disease and PC specific as the same proteins remained unaltered in GCs (Figure S1E). For complete list of altered proteins, see Table S1. We focused our attention on Homer-3 because it is enriched in PC dendrites and spines (Shiraishi et al., 2004Shiraishi Y. Mizutani A. Yuasa S. Mikoshiba K. Furuichi T. Differential expression of Homer family proteins in the developing mouse brain.J. Comp. Neurol. 2004; 473: 582-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) and is involved in the physical and functional coupling of metabotropic glutamate receptor 1 (mGluR1) and inositol-1,4,5-triphosphate receptor (IP3R) (Brakeman et al., 1997Brakeman P.R. Lanahan A.A. O’Brien R. Roche K. Barnes C.A. Huganir R.L. Worley P.F.

Immunostaining for Homer-3 at various ages in disease revealed that PC spines presented consistently reduced Homer-3 levels (Figure 2A). This reduction was also observed by immunoblotting the total cerebellar lysates for Homer-3 at various ages in disease (Figure 2B). In order to exclude the possibility that alteration in Homer-3 levels was due to degeneration of dendritic spines rather than the reduced expression of Homer-3, cerebellar synaptosomes were isolated from WT and Sca1154Q/2Q mice (Figure 2C). Immunoblotting for Homer-3 revealed an early reduction in Homer-3 levels as from P40 in Sca1154Q/2Q mice, whereas dendritic spine marker PSD-93 remained unchanged, excluding that early reduction in Homer-3 expression was due to spine loss (Figure 2D). We measured mRNA levels of Homer-3 and found no significant decline in Homer-3 transcripts from P20 until P120. A 2-fold reduction in Homer-3 mRNA was observed as from P150, Sca1154Q/2Q (Figure 2E), suggesting that the initial reduction in Homer-3 protein levels was not mRNA related. We also measured the expression of the short-form Homer-1a as it blocks interaction of Homer-3 to mGluR1 and found no alterations in its expression (Figures S2A and S2B). Since mutant Ataxin-1 impairs the expression of genes associated with glutamate signaling (Lin et al., 2000Lin X. Antalffy B. Kang D. Orr H.T. Zoghbi H.Y. Polyglutamine expansion down-regulates specific neuronal genes before pathologic changes in SCA1.Nat.

Gene profiling links SCA1 pathophysiology to glutamate signaling in Purkinje cells of transgenic mice.Hum. Mol. Genet. 2004; 13: 2535-2543Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar), we hypothesized that reduced Homer-3 levels were a reflection of dysfunctional glutamate-mediated signaling. Mimicking impairments in glutamatergic signaling by inhibiting glutamate receptors via AMPA-Kainate receptor antagonist CNQX led to a significant reduction in Homer-3 immunolabeling in the molecular layer (ML) of both WT and Sca1154Q/2Q mice (Figure 3A). As CFs are the major source of excitatory inputs to PCs, CF synapses onto PCs were destroyed by 3-acetylpyridine (3-AP) administration (Balaban, 1985Balaban C.D. Central neurotoxic effects of intraperitoneally administered 3-acetylpyridine, harmaline and niacinamide in Sprague-Dawley and Long-Evans rats: a critical review of central 3-acetylpyridine neurotoxicity.Brain Res. 1985; 356: 21-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Similar to CNQX treatment, 3-AP treatment led to a pronounced reduction in Homer-3 levels in WT condition, and in Sca1154Q/2Q cerebellum, Homer-3 levels were further reduced (Figure 3B). These results indicated that expression of Homer-3 was modulated by glutamatergic signaling and that reduced Homer-3 levels reflected disease-associated alterations in this pathway. As mGluR1 activation stimulates the de novo protein synthesis in neurons leading to mGluR-dependent plasticity, we examined whether enhancing mGluR1 activation would restore Homer-3 levels. Application of a single dose of harmaline (Harma), a tremorgenic drug, selectively increasing the release of glutamate at the CF-PC synapse (Beitz and Saxon, 2004Beitz A.J. Saxon D. Harmaline-induced climbing fiber activation causes amino acid and peptide release in the rodent cerebellar cortex and a unique temporal pattern of Fos expression in the olivo-cerebellar pathway.J. Neurocytol. 2004; 33: 49-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), augmented Homer-3 labeling within WT PC spines, but not in Sca1154Q/2Q PCs (Figure 3C). Next, we examined whether the direct activation of mGluR1 via cerebellar injection of type I mGluR agonist DHPG would influence Homer-3 levels. Pharmacological activation of mGluR1 significantly increased Homer-3 labeling intensities within WT dendritic spines. Again, the same treatment did not affect Homer-3 levels in Sca1154Q/2Q PCs (Figure 3D). Although our proteome analysis did not reveal early changes in mGluR1 expression levels, we examined whether alterations in its expression per se influenced Homer-3 expression. Immunolabeling for mGluR1 revealed comparable expression for mGluR1 between WT and Sca1154Q/2Q mice at P40 (age when MS was performed) and P100 (symptomatic age) (Figure S2C). Studies examining PC circuit in B05 mouse model revealed reduced PC responsiveness to CF activation and reduced CF translocation along the PC dendritic tree at early ages (Barnes et al., 2011Barnes J.A. Ebner B.A. Duvick L.A. Gao W. Chen G. Orr H.T. Ebner T.J. Abnormalities in the climbing fiber-Purkinje cell circuitry contribute to neuronal dysfunction in ATXN1[82Q] mice.J.

Purkinje cell ataxin-1 modulates climbing fiber synaptic input in developing and adult mouse cerebellum.J. Neurosci. 2013; 33: 5806-5820Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). We examined whether similar alterations would impact Sca1154Q/2Q PC responsiveness to Harma-induced CF activation. We used VGluT2 as a marker for CF terminals and found significant and persistent reduction in the volume of VGluT2-positive puncta in Sca1154Q/2Q ML. In total, 48% of mutant VGluT2-positive puncta displayed volumes smaller than 3 μm3 compared to 27% in WT at P30 (Figure 4A). Additionally, an increase in the number of VGluT2-positive puncta onto PC dendrites in Sca1154Q/2Q compared to WT animals was observed (Figure 4B), indicating that a substantial proportion of CF terminals in Sca1154Q/2Q were smaller in volume but numerous. Measurement of the CF territory onto PC dendrites revealed significant reduction in CF innervation territories in Sca1154Q/2Q (Figure 4C). Next, we examined the functionality of the CF-PC synapse by measuring the CF-mediated excitatory postsynaptic currents (CF-EPSCs) in WT and Sca1154Q/2Q mice at two distinct ages: P50 and P100. The CF-EPSCs were evoked by applying a current of 5–100 μA, CFs were detected in a range of 5–30 μA, the intensity of the stimulation was progressively increased, and the amplitude of the postsynaptic response was measured. A significant difference in the kinetics of CF-EPSCs was observed: the 10%–90% rise time and the decay time constant of the CF-EPSCs were significantly reduced, whereas the 10%–90% rise slope was significantly increased in Sca1154Q/2Q mice (Figure 4D). These measurements are indicative of the electrotonic length from the soma to the site of the synapse and suggest that CF-EPSCs in mutant PCs arise from synapses located electrotonically closer to the soma. Amplitudes of CF-EPSCs and paired-pulse depression (PPD) remained unaltered between WT and Sca1154Q/2Q mice (Figure 4D). We also analyzed passive properties of PCs calculated as previously described (Llano et al., 1991Llano I. Marty A. Armstrong C.M. Konnerth A. Synaptic- and agonist-induced excitatory currents of Purkinje cells in rat cerebellar slices.J. Physiol. 1991; 434: 183-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). The lumped dendritic capacitance (C2) was significantly smaller at both P50 and P100 in the Sca1154Q/2Q PCs, while no difference was observed in the lumped soma and proximal dendrite capacitance (C1) (Figure 4D), suggesting that the average total membrane area of the dendritic tree of the mutant PCs is smaller than that of WT PCs already at an early age in disease. No significant changes were observed in the lumped resistance (data not shown). Subsequently, ultrastructural analysis and measurements of synaptic vesicle pool occupancy within presynapses in the dendritic region proximal to PC somata where CF synapses are predominant revealed profound alterations in Sca1154Q/2Q mice. In total, 85% of presynapses in Sca1154Q/2Q presented a synaptic vesicle pool occupancy lower than 50%, whereas in the WT only 32% of the presynapses had less than 50% occupancy (Figure 4E). To examine whether the reduced number of synaptic vesicles could impact PC responsiveness, we measured the miniature EPSCs (mEPSCs) in PCs and found no alterations in the amplitude of the mEPSCs at P50 and P100 in mutant condition. In contrast, the frequency of mEPSC showed a trend to be reduced by P100 in mutant PCs compared to WT PCs (Figure 4F), suggesting that spontaneous release of synaptic vesicles was reduced. In order to examine whether alterations in CF inputs might influence PC activation, we measured the activation state of PCs via the nuclear translocation of immediate early gene c-Fos, induced in response to neuronal activity. For CF-induced PC activation, a protocol based on the activation of CFs via Harma was used (Figure S3A). After Harma treatment, inferior olive (IO) neurons exhibited nuclear c-Fos to a similar extent in both WT and Sca1154Q/2Q mice (Figure S3B), indicating that the activation state of IO neurons per se was not altered in disease. In total, 10% of PCs in WT mice presented strong nuclear c-Fos staining after 100 min of Harma treatment, which increased to 20% at 150 min and decayed by 300 min. However, the nuclear c-Fos responses were largely reduced within Sca1154Q/2Q PCs (Figure S3C). Neuronal activity is associated with the downstream activation of critical signaling pathways such as mTORC1, which in turn regulates protein translation, a prerequisite for synaptic plasticity (Gong et al., 2006Gong R. Park C.S. Abbassi N.R. Tang S.J. Roles of glutamate receptors and the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway in activity-dependent dendritic protein synthesis in hippocampal neurons.J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 18802-18815Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). So we investigated mTORC1 activation status in Sca1154Q/2Q by measuring phosphorylation state of S6. Immunolabeling for pS6 revealed significantly reduced phosphorylation of S6 at P30 in Sca1154Q/2Q compared to WT condition (Figure 5A). S6 expression remained unchanged between WT and Sca1154Q/2Q mice, ruling out that lower S6 levels led to reduced phosphorylation of S6 (Figure 5B). As further evidence for reduced mTORC1 signaling, the phosphorylated levels of mTORC1-dependent translation regulator 4E-BP1 were reduced by 35% in Sca1154Q/2Q cerebellum (Figure S4A). To confirm that glutamatergic signaling regulates mTORC1 activation in PCs, WT mice were treated with GluR antagonist CNQX or with 3-AP. Both treatments led to a significant reduction in pS6 immunolabeling in PCs (Figures 5C and 5D). Conversely, increasing mGluR1 receptor activation via application of DHPG strongly increased pS6 levels within WT PCs. However, the same treatment did not increase pS6 levels in Sca1154Q/2Q PCs (Figure 5E), suggesting that alterations in synaptic signaling in mutant PCs might impact the activation of mTORC1 pathway. To validate that impairment in mTORC1 signaling was mutant PC-specific and arose due to dysfunctional synaptic transmission, we measured pS6 levels in the Sca1154Q/2Q brain and found no alterations in pS6 expression within the various brain regions examined (Figures S4B–S4D). As Sca1154Q/2Q mice ubiquitously express mutant Ataxin-1, this suggests that mutant Ataxin-1 does not directly interfere with mTORC1 signaling. Since Ataxin-1 interacts with transcriptional regulators and influences transcription (Crespo-Barreto et al., 2010Crespo-Barreto J. Fryer J.D. Shaw C.A. Orr H.T. Zoghbi H.Y. Partial loss of ataxin-1 function contributes to transcriptional dysregulation in spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 pathogenesis.PLoS Genet. 2010; 6: e1001021Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), mRNA levels of important components of the mTORC1 pathway (Mtor, Eif4b, and RpS6) were measured, revealing no alterations (Figure S4E). As mTORC1 signaling pathway is implicated in activity-dependent protein synthesis, thereby regulating forms of synaptic plasticity, we examined how impairment in mTORC1 pathway might specifically affect the expression of proteins involved in plasticity-dependent mechanisms. To identify mTORC1 signaling-dependent proteins, P20, WT mice were treated with mTORC1 inhibitor Rapamycin (Rapa). Immunolabeling and immunoblotting for pS6 from total cerebellar lysates, as well as from sequential cerebellar sections, confirmed the success of the treatment, as pS6 levels were negligible after Rapa treatment (Figure 6A). PCs and GCs were isolated via laser-capture microdissection (LDM) from age-matched WT, WT-Rapa, and Sca1154Q/2Q littermates, and lysates were subjected to MS analysis. In order to obtain candidates having an mTORC1-dependent expression, we first compared WT-Rapa PC to WT PC proteomes. The candidates so obtained were compared to the ones altered in PCs from Sca1154"

However, the mechanisms underlying Hsp104 potentiation remain incompletely defined.

We also define the ATPase and substrate-binding modalities needed for potentiated Hsp104A503V activity in vitro and in vivo. Hsp104A503V disaggregase activity is strongly inhibited by the Y257A mutation that disrupts substrate binding to the nucleotide-binding domain 1 (NBD1) pore loop and is abolished by the Y662A mutation that disrupts substrate binding to the NBD2 pore loop. Intriguingly, Hsp104A503V disaggregase activity responds to mixtures of ATP and adenosine 5′-(γ-thio)-triphosphate (a slowly hydrolyzable ATP analogue) differently from Hsp104.

Thus, Hsp104A503V displays a more robust activity that is unperturbed by sensor-1 mutations that greatly reduce Hsp104 activity in vivo.

Spectrofluorimetric measurements revealed that AFB can strongly quench the BSA intrinsic fluorescence through producing a non-fluorescent complex. This quenching mechanism was thoroughly investigated with regard to the type of quenching, binding constant, number of binding locations and the fundamental thermodynamic parameters. Subsequently, the association constant of AFB with BSA was computed at three different temperatures and was found to range from 7.34 to 13.19 x105 L mol-1. Thermodynamic parameters calculations demonstrated a positive ΔSƟvalue with both negative ΔHϴand ΔGϴvalues for AFB–BSA complex, which in turn infers thata spontaneous binding is taking place with both electrostatic bonding and hydrophobic interactions participating in the binding of AFB and BSA. Similarly, the UV absorption spectra of AFB-BSA system were studied and confirmed the interaction. Conformational alteration of the protein upon binding to AFB was elaborated with the aid of three dimensional fluorescence measurements as well as synchronous fluorescence spectra."

With the aim of screening new anti-cancer agents that inhibit cancer cell motility, we tested the inhibitory activity of seven lichen species collected from the Romanian Carpathian Mountains against migration and invasion of human lung cancer cells and further investigated the molecular mechanisms underlying their anti-metastatic activity. Among them, Alectoria samentosa, Flavocetraria nivalis, Alectoria ochroleuca, and Usnea florida showed significant inhibitory activity against motility of human lung cancer cells. HPLC results showed that usnic acid is the main compound in these lichens, and (+)-usnic acid showed similar inhibitory activity that crude extract have. Mechanistically, β-catenin-mediated TOPFLASH activity and KITENIN-mediated AP-1 activity were decreased by (+)-usnic acid treatment in a dose-dependent manner. The quantitative real-time PCR data showed that (+)-usnic acid decreased the mRNA level of CD44, Cyclin D1 and c-myc, which are the downstream target genes of both β-catenin/LEF and c-jun/AP-1. Also, Rac1 and RhoA activities were decreased by treatment with (+)-usnic acid. Interestingly, higher inhibitory activity for cell invasion was observed when cells were treated with (+)-usnic acid and cetuximab. These results implied that (+)-usnic acid might have potential activity in inhibition of cancer cell metastasis, and (+)-usnic acid could be used for anti-cancer therapy with a distinct mechanisms of action."

Patients received Supervised Exercise Therapy according to the guideline Intermittent Claudication of the Royal Dutch Society for Physiotherapy. Three-level mixed linear regression analysis was carried out to analyze the association between patient characteristics, comorbidities and Initial Claudication Distance at 1, 3, 6 and 12 months.Data from 2995 patients was analyzed. Results showed that being female, advanced age and a high body-mass index were associated with lower Initial Claudication Distance at all-time points (p = 0.000). Besides, a negative association between cardiac comorbidity and Initial Claudication Distance was revealed (p = 0.011). The interaction time by age, time by body-mass index and time by vascular comorbidity were significantly associated with Initial Claudication Distance (p≤ 0.05). Per year increase in age (range: 33-93 years), the reduction in Initial Claudication Distance was 8m after 12 months of Supervised Exercise Therapy. One unit increase in body-mass index (range: 16-44 kg/m2) led to 10 m less improvement in Initial Claudication Distance after 12 months and for vascular comorbidity the reduction in improvement was 85 m after 12 months.This study reveals that females, patients at advanced age, patients with a high body-mass index and cardiac comorbidity are more likely to show less improvement in Initial Claudication Distances (ICD) after 1, 3, 6 and 12 months of Supervised Exercise Therapy. Further research should elucidate treatment adaptations that optimize treatment outcomes for these subgroups."

https://openalex.org/W2225231744,"Infants with intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) are at increased risk for neonatal and lifelong morbidities affecting multiple organ systems including the intestinal tract. The underlying mechanisms for the risk to the intestine remain poorly understood. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that IUGR affects the development of goblet and Paneth cell lineages, thus compromising the innate immunity and barrier functions of the epithelium. Using a mouse model of maternal thromboxane A2-analog infusion to elicit maternal hypertension and resultant IUGR, we tested whether IUGR alters ileal maturation and specifically disrupts mucus-producing goblet and antimicrobial-secreting Paneth cell development. We measured body weights, ileal weights and ileal lengths from birth to postnatal day (P) 56. We also determined the abundance of goblet and Paneth cells and their mRNA products, localization of cellular tight junctions, cell proliferation, and apoptosis to interrogate cellular homeostasis. Comparison of the murine findings with human IUGR ileum allowed us to verify observed changes in the mouse were relevant to clinical IUGR. At P14 IUGR mice had decreased ileal lengths, fewer goblet and Paneth cells, reductions in Paneth cell specific mRNAs, and decreased cell proliferation. These findings positively correlated with severity of IUGR. Furthermore, the decrease in murine Paneth cells was also seen in human IUGR ileum. IUGR disrupts the normal trajectory of ileal development, particularly affecting the composition and secretory products of the epithelial surface of the intestine. We speculate that this abnormal intestinal development may constitute an inherent “first hit”, rendering IUGR intestine susceptible to further injury, infection, or inflammation."

Whether concomitant sleep disorders (SDs) modify the risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) in patients with psoriasis remains unknown.Using the Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database (NHIRD), we conducted a cohort study to investigate the association between concomitant SDs and CVD risk in patients with psoriasis. Data from 99,628 adults who received a psoriasis diagnosis during the period from 2004 to 2010 were analyzed. Cox proportional hazards regression analysis models were used to compare the risks of ischemic heart disease (IHD) and stroke between patients with and without SDs.Psoriasis patients with a concomitant SD had significantly higher risks of IHD (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR], 1.25; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.22-1.28) and stroke (aHR, 1.24; 95% CI, 1.16-1.33) as compared with psoriasis patients without SDs. All psoriasis patient subgroups, including those with mild and severe psoriasis and those with and without arthritis, had increased HRs for IHD and stroke. The increases in IHD and stroke risks conferred by SDs were proportional to the dose of hypnotics used. The effect of SDs on the risks of IHD and stroke was greater in young adults than in middle-aged and older adults.The risks of IHD and stroke were higher for psoriasis patients with SDs than for those without SDs.

Patients who took insulin alone or in combination with other antidiabetic agents had a significantly higher risk of HZ (aOR = 1.25, p<0.001) than those who received monotherapy. Diabetic patients comorbid with coronary artery disease and associated microvascular disorders had an increased risk of HZ occurrence."
https://openalex.org/W2238222513,"Several cytokines may play roles in the immunological pathogenesis of mycoplasmal pneumonia caused by Mycoplasma pneumoniae. In this study, we investigated serum cytokine profiles in children with mycoplasmal pneumonia. The serum levels of interleukin (IL)-8, IL-10, and IL-18 were examined using ELISA kits in 34 patients with M. pneumoniae infection (Group 1, 11 with severe mycoplasmal pneumonia; Group 2, 13 with mild mycoplasmal pneumonia; Group 3, 10 with asthma) and 32 age-matched, non-infected controls. The serum levels of IL-8, IL-10, and IL-18 increased significantly in patients with mycoplasmal pneumonia compared with those in controls (P<0.01). The serum levels of IL-10 decreased significantly in Group 1 compared with those in Group 2 (P<0.01). The serum levels of IL-18 increased significantly in Group 1 compared with those in Group 2 (P<0.01). The serum levels of IL-10 and IL-18 decreased significantly in 10 M. pneumoniae-infected patients with asthma compared with those in 24 M. pneumoniae-infected patients without asthma (P<0.01). We examined the level of interleukins (IL-8, IL-10 and IL-18) after the patients started therapy. The data showed that IL-18 were lower after therapy (P<0.01). Collectively, our data suggested that these cytokines may be involved in the pathogenesis of mycoplasmal pneumonia."
https://openalex.org/W2231265774,"The temporal contingency of feedback is an essential requirement of successful human-computer interactions. The timing of feedback not only affects the behavior of a user but is also accompanied by changes in psychophysiology and neural activity. In three fMRI experiments we systematically studied the impact of delayed feedback on brain activity while subjects performed an auditory categorization task. In the first fMRI experiment, we analyzed the effects of rare and thus unexpected delays of different delay duration on brain activity. In the second experiment, we investigated if users can adapt to frequent delays. Therefore, delays were presented as often as immediate feedback. In a third experiment, the influence of interaction outage was analyzed by measuring the effect of infrequent omissions of feedback on brain activity. The results show that unexpected delays in feedback presentation compared to immediate feedback stronger activate inter alia bilateral the anterior insular cortex, the posterior medial frontal cortex, the left inferior parietal lobule and the right inferior frontal junction. The strength of this activation increases with the duration of the delay. Thus, delays interrupt the course of an interaction and trigger an orienting response that in turn activates brain regions of action control. If delays occur frequently, users can adapt, delays become expectable, and the brain activity in the observed network diminishes over the course of the interaction. However, introducing rare omissions of expected feedback reduces the system's trustworthiness which leads to an increase in brain activity not only in response to such omissions but also following frequently occurring and thus expected delays."

https://openalex.org/W2238959460,"Actin-interacting protein 1 (AIP1) is a conserved WD repeat protein that promotes disassembly of actin filaments when actin-depolymerizing factor (ADF)/cofilin is present. Although AIP1 is known to be essential for a number of cellular events involving dynamic rearrangement of the actin cytoskeleton, the regulatory mechanism of the function of AIP1 is unknown. In this study, we report that two AIP1 isoforms from the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, known as UNC-78 and AIPL-1, are pH-sensitive in enhancement of actin filament disassembly. Both AIP1 isoforms only weakly enhance disassembly of ADF/cofilin-bound actin filaments at an acidic pH but show stronger disassembly activity at neutral and basic pH values. However, a severing-defective mutant of UNC-78 shows pH-insensitive binding to ADF/cofilin-decorated actin filaments, suggesting that the process of filament severing or disassembly, but not filament binding, is pH-dependent. His-60 of AIP1 is located near the predicted binding surface for the ADF/cofilin-actin complex, and an H60K mutation of AIP1 partially impairs its pH sensitivity, suggesting that His-60 is involved in the pH sensor for AIP1. These biochemical results suggest that pH-dependent changes in AIP1 activity might be a novel regulatory mechanism of actin filament dynamics."
https://openalex.org/W2227477554,"Recognition of histone post-translational modifications is pivotal for directing chromatin-modifying enzymes to specific genomic regions and regulating their activities. Emerging evidence suggests that other structural features of nucleosomes also contribute to precise targeting of downstream chromatin complexes, such as linker DNA, the histone globular domain, and nucleosome spacing. However, how chromatin complexes coordinate individual interactions to achieve high affinity and specificity remains unclear. The Rpd3S histone deacetylase utilizes the chromodomain-containing Eaf3 subunit and the PHD domain-containing Rco1 subunit to recognize nucleosomes that are methylated at lysine 36 of histone H3 (H3K36me). We showed previously that the binding of Eaf3 to H3K36me can be allosterically activated by Rco1. To investigate how this chromatin recognition module is regulated in the context of the Rpd3S complex, we first determined the subunit interaction network of Rpd3S. Interestingly, we found that Rpd3S contains two copies of the essential subunit Rco1, and both copies of Rco1 are required for full functionality of Rpd3S. Our functional dissection of Rco1 revealed that besides its known chromatin-recognition interfaces, other regions of Rco1 are also critical for Rpd3S to recognize its nucleosomal substrates and functionin vivo. This unexpected result uncovered an important and understudied aspect of chromatin recognition. It suggests that precisely reading modified chromatin may not only need the combined actions of reader domains but also require an internal signaling circuit that coordinates the individual actions in a productive way.

https://openalex.org/W2234759249,"The spatial ecology of freshwater crabs and their conservation status is largely understudied in Africa. An ecological assessment was conducted at 104 localities in 51 rivers and/or streams in the Eastern Highlands of Zimbabwe whereby the distribution and abundances of freshwater crab species were mapped and the possible drivers of the observed trends in population structure explored. In addition, information on crab utilisation as a food resource by local communities was assessed via face to face interviews across the region. Finally, the conservation status of each species was assessed using the IUCN Red List criteria. Only two crab species Potamonautes mutareensis and Potamonautes unispinus were recorded within the region of study. Potamonautes mutareensis was largely restricted to less impacted environments in the high mountainous river system, whereas P. unispinus was found in low laying areas. In stretches of river where both species were found to co-occur, the species were never sampled from the same site, with P. mutareensis occurring in shallower, faster flowing environments and P. unispinus in deeper, slow flowing sites. Interview results revealed that the local communities, particularly in the southern part of the Eastern Highlands around the Chipinge area, had a considerable level of utilisation (55% of households) on the harvesting of crabs for household consumption during the non-agricultural season (May to September). Results from the IUCN Red List assessment indicate that both species should be considered as ""Least Concern"". Threats to freshwater crabs in the Eastern Highlands, however, include widespread anthropogenic impacts such as habitat destruction associated with gold and diamond mining, inorganic and organic pollution and possibly exploitation for human consumption. The current study provides important information and insight towards the possible development of a freshwater crab conservation action plan within the region."
https://openalex.org/W2233966172,"Evolutionary benefits of task fidelity and improving information acquisition via multiple transfers of materials between individuals in a task partitioned system have been shown before, but in this paper we provide a mechanistic explanation of these phenomena. Using a simple mathematical model describing the individual interactions of the wasps, we explain the functioning of the common stomach, an information center, which governs construction behavior and task change. Our central hypothesis is a symmetry between foragers who deposit water and foragers who withdraw water into and out of the common stomach. We combine this with a trade-off between acceptance and resistance to water transfer. We ultimately derive a mathematical function that relates the number of interactions that foragers complete with common stomach wasps during a foraging cycle. We use field data and additional model assumptions to calculate values of our model parameters, and we use these to explain why the fullness of the common stomach stabilizes just below 50 percent, why the average number of successful interactions between foragers and the wasps forming the common stomach is between 5 and 7, and why there is a variation in this number of interactions over time. Our explanation is that our proposed water exchange mechanism places natural bounds on the number of successful interactions possible, water exchange is set to optimize mediation of water through the common stomach, and the chance that foragers abort their task prematurely is very low."
https://openalex.org/W2236698265,"Stimulation of proteoglycan (PG) synthesis and deposition plays an important role in the pathophysiology of fibrosis and is an early and dominant feature of pulmonary fibrosis. Transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1) is a major cytokine associated with fibrosis that induces excessive synthesis of matrix proteins, particularly PGs. Owing to the importance of PGs in matrix assembly and in mediating cytokine and growth factor signaling, a strategy based on the inhibition of PG synthesis may prevent excessive matrix PG deposition and attenuates profibrotic effects of TGF-β1 in lung fibroblasts. Here, we showed that 4-MU4-deoxy-β-D-xylopyranoside, a competitive inhibitor of β4-galactosyltransferase7, inhibited PG synthesis and secretion in a dose-dependent manner by decreasing the level of both chondroitin/dermatan- and heparin-sulfate PG in primary lung fibroblasts. Importantly, 4-MU4-deoxy-xyloside was able to counteract TGF-β1-induced synthesis of PGs, activation of fibroblast proliferation and fibroblast-myofibroblast differentiation. Mechanistically, 4-MU4-deoxy-xyloside treatment inhibited TGF-β1-induced activation of canonical Smads2/3 signaling pathway in lung primary fibroblasts. The knockdown of β4-galactosyltransferase7 mimicked 4-MU4-deoxy-xyloside effects, indicating selective inhibition of β4-galactosyltransferase7 by this compound. Collectively, this study reveals the anti-fibrotic activity of 4-MU4-deoxy-xyloside and indicates that inhibition of PG synthesis represents a novel strategy for the treatment of lung fibrosis."

SecYEG function is facilitated by cytosolic partners, mainly a nascent chain-ribosome complex or the SecA ATPase motor protein. Extensive efforts utilizing both biochemical and biophysical approaches have been made to determine whether SecYEG functions as a monomer or a dimer, but such approaches have often generated conflicting results. Here we have employed site-specific in vivo photo-cross-linking or cysteine cross-linking, along with co-immunoprecipitation or SecA footprinting techniques to readdress this issue. Our findings show that the SecY dimer to monomer ratio is relatively constant regardless of whether translocons are actively engaged with protein substrate or not. Under the former conditions the SecY dimer can be captured associated with a translocon-jammed substrate, indicative of SecY dimer function. Furthermore, SecA ATPase can be cross-linked to two copies of SecY when the complex contains a translocation intermediate.

https://openalex.org/W2240012356,"Coexistence of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and antibody against HBsAg (anti-HBs) comprises an atypical serological profile in patients with chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. In this study, in total 94 patients with coexisting HBsAg and anti-HBs and 94 age- and sex-matched patients with positive HBsAg were characterized by quantitatively measuring HBsAg and HBV DNA, sequencing large S genes, and observing clinical features. Compared with common hepatitis B patients, the patients with coexisting HBsAg and anti-HBs had lower HBsAg and HBV DNA levels. These two groups had similar rate of pre-S deletion mutations. However, in patients with coexisting HBsAg and anti-HBs, more amino acid substitutions in the a determinant of S gene were observed in HBV genotype C, but not in genotype B. Fourteen patients with coexisting HBsAg and anti-HBs were followed up for an average of 15.5 months. There were no significant changes in the levels of HBsAg, anti-HBs, HBV DNA and ALT over the follow-up period. Compared with the baseline sequences, amino acid substitutions in the MHR of HBsAg occurred in 14.3% (2/14) patients. In conclusion, coexistence of HBsAg and anti-HBs may be associated with higher frequency of mutations in the a determinant of HBV genotype C."
https://openalex.org/W2229468400,"Radiotherapy (RT) is a potent anti-tumor modality. However, unwanted effects including increased recurrence and metastasis that involve factors such as cytokines, which induce complex molecular mechanisms, have also been reported. In a previous study, we showed that interleukin (IL)-12 and radiotherapy combination treatment suppressed tumor growth and metastasis in a hepatoma mouse model. In this study, we investigated the mechanism underlying the IL-12 anti-tumor effect during radiotherapy. In tumor-bearing mice, irradiation decreased IL-12 expression in the tumors and spleens. However, a number of dendritic cells infiltrated into the tumors in which IL-12 expression did not decrease. To further study the underlying detailed mechanism for this decrease in IL-12, LPS-stimulated bone marrow-derived dendritic cells (BMDCs) were irradiated, and then IL-12- and IL-6-associated molecules were examined in irradiated tumors and BMDCs. Irradiation resulted in IL-12 suppression and IL-6 increase. IL-6 and signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) inhibitors restored the irradiation-induced IL-12 decrease via suppression of C-Rel activation. Taken together, our study suggests that irradiation-induced IL-6 can decrease IL-12 production through the inhibition of C-Rel phosphorylation by the IL-6/STAT3 signaling pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2234755789,"p300, a ubiquitous transcription coactivator, plays an important role in gene activation. Our previous work demonstrated that human inducible nitric oxide synthase (hiNOS) expression can be highly induced with the cytokine mixture (CM) of TNF-α + IL-1β + IFN-γ. In this study, we investigated the functional role of p300 in the regulation of hiNOS gene expression. Our initial data showed that overexpression of p300 significantly increased the basal and cytokine-induced hiNOS promoter activities in A549 cells. Interestingly, p300 activated cytokine-induced hiNOS transcriptional activity was completely abrogated by deleting the upstream hiNOS enhancer at -5 kb to -6 kb in the promoter. Furthermore, p300 over-expression increased cytokine-induced transcriptional activity on a heterologous minimal TK promoter with the same hiNOS enhancer. Site-directed mutagenesis of the hiNOS AP-1 motifs revealed that an intact upstream (-5.3 kb) AP-1 binding site was critical for p300 mediated cytokine-induced hiNOS transcription. Furthermore, our ChIP analysis demonstrated that p300 was binding to Jun D and Fra-2 proteins at -5.3 kb AP-1 binding site in vivo. Lastly, our 3C assay was able to detect a long DNA loop between the hiNOS enhancer and core promoter site, and ChIP loop assay confirmed that p300 binds to AP-1 and RNA pol II proteins. Overall, our results suggest that coactivator p300 mediates cytokine-induced hiNOS transactivation by forming a distant DNA loop between its enhancer and core promoter region."
https://openalex.org/W2237717580,"Lysine deacetylases (KDACs) are enzymes that reverse the post-translational modification of lysine acetylation. Recently, a series of N-acetylthioureas were synthesized and reported to enhance the activity of KDAC8 with a fluorogenic substrate. To determine if the activation was general, we synthesized three of the most potent N-acetylthioureas and measured their effect with peptide substrates and the fluorogenic substrate under multiple reaction conditions and utilizing two enzyme purification approaches. No activation was observed for any of the three N-acetylthioureas under any assayed conditions. Further characterization of KDAC8 kinetics with the fluorogenic substrate yielded a kcat/KM of 164 ± 17 in the absence of any N-acetylthioureas. This catalytic efficiency is comparable to or higher than that previously reported when KDAC8 was activated by the N-acetylthioureas, suggesting that the previously reported activation effect may be due to use of an enzyme preparation that contains a large fraction of inactive enzyme. Further characterization with a less active preparation and additional substrates leads us to conclude that N-acetylthioureas are not true activators of KDAC8 and only increase activity if the enzyme preparation is below the maximal basal activity."

Here, we profiled gene expression of Xenorhabdus koppenhoeferi during their symbiotic persistence in the newly formed infective juveniles of the host nematode Steinernema scarabaei through the selective capture of transcribed sequences (SCOTS). The obtained gene expression profile was then compared with other nematode-bacteria partnerships represented by Steinernema carpocapsae—Xenorhabdus nematophila and Heterorhabditis bacteriophora—Photorhabdus temperata. A total of 29 distinct genes were identified to be up-regulated and 53 were down-regulated in X. koppenhoeferi while in S. scarabaei infective juveniles. Of the identified genes, 8 of the up-regulated and 14 of the down-regulated genes were similarly expressed in X. nematophila during persistence in its host nematode S. carpocapsae. However, only one from each of these up- and down-regulated genes was common to the mutualistic partnership between the bacterium P. temperata and the nematode H. bacteriophora. Interactive network analysis of the shared genes between X. koppenhoeferi and X. nematophila demonstrated that the up-regulated genes were mainly involved in bacterial survival and the down-regulated genes were more related to bacterial virulence and active growth. Disruption of two selected genes pta (coding phosphotransacetylase) and acnB (coding aconitate hydratase) in X. nematophila with shared expression signature with X. koppenhoeferi confirmed that these genes are important for bacterial persistence in the nematode host. The results of our comparative analyses show that the two Xenorhabdus species share a little more than a quarter of the transcriptional mechanisms during persistence in their nematode hosts but these features are quite different from those used by P. temperata bacteria in their nematode host H. bacteriophora."
https://openalex.org/W2236014693,"For high-dimensional and massive data sets, traditional centralized gene expression programming (GEP) or improved algorithms lead to increased run-time and decreased prediction accuracy. To solve this problem, this paper proposes a new improved algorithm called distributed function mining for gene expression programming based on fast reduction (DFMGEP-FR). In DFMGEP-FR, fast attribution reduction in binary search algorithms (FAR-BSA) is proposed to quickly find the optimal attribution set, and the function consistency replacement algorithm is given to solve integration of the local function model. Thorough comparative experiments for DFMGEP-FR, centralized GEP and the parallel gene expression programming algorithm based on simulated annealing (parallel GEPSA) are included in this paper. For the waveform, mushroom, connect-4 and musk datasets, the comparative results show that the average time-consumption of DFMGEP-FR drops by 89.09%%, 88.85%, 85.79% and 93.06%, respectively, in contrast to centralized GEP and by 12.5%, 8.42%, 9.62% and 13.75%, respectively, compared with parallel GEPSA. Six well-studied UCI test data sets demonstrate the efficiency and capability of our proposed DFMGEP-FR algorithm for distributed function mining."

This study focused on the use of animal-derived remedies, and we investigated the effects of migration on the traditional medical system of the indigenous Truká people. This ethnic group lives in Northeast Brazil and is currently distributed in four distinct villages. In these villages, the zootherapeutic knowledge of 54 indigenous people was determined through semi-structured questionnaires given from September 2013 to January 2014. The interviewees indicated 137 zootherapeutic uses involving 21 animal species. The variety of species and their uses have a higher similarity between villages that are closer to each other, which can be a reflection of geographic and environmental factors. However, even close villages showed a low similarity in the zootherapeutic uses recorded, which reflects a strong idiosyncrasy regarding the knowledge of each village. Hence, each village may be influenced by the physical environment and contact with other cultures, which may maintain or reduce the contact of younger villages with the original village."
