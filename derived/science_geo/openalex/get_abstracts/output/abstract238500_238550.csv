https://openalex.org/W2063120457,"Neurons are highly polarized and comprised of two structurally and functionally distinct parts, an axon and dendrites. We previously showed that collapsin response mediator protein-2 (CRMP-2) is critical for specifying axon/dendrite fate, possibly by promoting neurite elongation via microtubule assembly. Here, we showed that glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK-3β) phosphorylated CRMP-2 at Thr-514 and inactivated it. The expression of the nonphosphorylated form of CRMP-2 or inhibition of GSK-3β induced the formation of multiple axon-like neurites in hippocampal neurons. The expression of constitutively active GSK-3β impaired neuronal polarization, whereas the nonphosphorylated form of CRMP-2 counteracted the inhibitory effects of GSK-3β, indicating that GSK-3β regulates neuronal polarity through the phosphorylation of CRMP-2. Treatment of hippocampal neurons with neurotrophin-3 (NT-3) induced inactivation of GSK-3β and dephosphorylation of CRMP-2. Knockdown of CRMP-2 inhibited NT-3-induced axon outgrowth. These results suggest that NT-3 decreases phosphorylated CRMP-2 and increases nonphosphorylated active CRMP-2, thereby promoting axon outgrowth."
https://openalex.org/W2095699986,"Cryptococcus neoformans is a basidiomycetous yeast ubiquitous in the environment, a model for fungal pathogenesis, and an opportunistic human pathogen of global importance. We have sequenced its â¼20-megabase genome, which contains â¼6500 intron-rich gene structures and encodes a transcriptome abundant in alternatively spliced and antisense messages. The genome is rich in transposons, many of which cluster at candidate centromeric regions. The presence of these transposons may drive karyotype instability and phenotypic variation. C. neoformans encodes unique genes that may contribute to its unusual virulence properties, and comparison of two phenotypically distinct strains reveals variation in gene content in addition to sequence polymorphisms between the genomes."

https://openalex.org/W2049394618,"In spite of their importance in fundamental and applied studies, the preparation of endohedral fullerenes has relied on difficult-to-control physical methods. We report a four-step organic reaction that completely closes a 13-membered ring orifice of an open-cage fullerene. This process can be used to synthesize a fullerene C 60 encapsulating molecular hydrogen, which can be isolated as a pure product. This molecular surgical method should make possible the preparation of a series of C 60 fullerenes, encapsulating either small atoms or molecules, that are not accessible by conventional physical methods."

By working in the time domain, we determined the motion of the magnetic moment throughout the process of spin-transfer–driven switching, and we measured turn-on times of steady-state precessional modes. Time-resolved studies of magnetic relaxation allow for the direct measurement of magnetic damping in a nanomagnet and prove that this damping can be controlled electrically using spin-polarized currents."
https://openalex.org/W2047455709,"Protein degradation in eukaryotes usually requires multiubiquitylation and subsequent delivery of the tagged substrates to the proteasome. Recent studies suggest the involvement of the AAA ATPase CDC48, its cofactors, and other ubiquitin binding factors in protein degradation, but how these proteins work together is unclear. Here we show that these factors cooperate sequentially through protein-protein interactions and thereby escort ubiquitin-protein conjugates to the proteasome. Central to this pathway is the chaperone CDC48/p97, which coordinates substrate recruitment, E4-catalyzed multiubiquitin chain assembly, and proteasomal targeting. Concomitantly, CDC48 prevents the formation of excessive multiubiquitin chain sizes that are surplus to requirements for degradation. In yeast, this escort pathway guides a transcription factor from its activation in the cytosol to its final degradation and also mediates proteolysis at the endoplasmic reticulum by the ERAD pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2019337061,"Most mRNAs contain secondary structure, yet their codons must be in single-stranded form to be translated. Until now, no helicase activity has been identified which could account for the ability of ribosomes to translate through downstream mRNA secondary structure. Using an oligonucleotide displacement assay, together with a stepwise in vitro translation system made up of purified components, we show that ribosomes are able to disrupt downstream helices, including a perfect 27 base pair helix of predicted Tm = 70°. Using helices of different lengths and registers, the helicase active site can be localized to the middle of the downstream tunnel, between the head and shoulder of the 30S subunit. Mutation of residues in proteins S3 and S4 that line the entry to the tunnel impairs helicase activity. We conclude that the ribosome itself is an mRNA helicase and that proteins S3 and S4 may play a role in its processivity."
https://openalex.org/W2036327914,"Two classes of gas-phase aluminum-iodine clusters have been identified whose stability and reactivity can be understood in terms of the spherical shell jellium model. Experimental reactivity studies show that the Al 13 I – x clusters exhibit pronounced stability for even numbers of I atoms. Theoretical investigations reveal that the enhanced stability is associated with complementary pairs of I atoms occupying the on-top sites on the opposing Al atoms of the Al 13 – core. We also report the existence of another series, Al 14 I – x , that exhibits stability for odd numbers of I atoms. This series can be described as consisting of an Al 14 I – 3 core upon which the I atoms occupy on-top locations around the Al atoms. The potential synthetic utility of superatom chemistry built upon these motifs is addressed."

https://openalex.org/W1991379214,"Iron (Fe) is an essential micronutrient for virtually all organisms and serves as a cofactor for a wide variety of vital cellular processes. Although Fe deficiency is the primary nutritional disorder in the world, cellular responses to Fe deprivation are poorly understood. We have discovered a posttranscriptional regulatory process controlled by Fe deficiency, which coordinately drives widespread metabolic reprogramming. We demonstrate that, in response to Fe deficiency, the Saccharomyces cerevisiae Cth2 protein specifically downregulates mRNAs encoding proteins that participate in many Fe-dependent processes. mRNA turnover requires the binding of Cth2, an RNA binding protein conserved in plants and mammals, to specific AU-rich elements in the 3′ untranslated region of mRNAs targeted for degradation. These studies elucidate coordinated global metabolic reprogramming in response to Fe deficiency and identify a mechanism for achieving this by targeting specific mRNA molecules for degradation, thereby facilitating the utilization of limited cellular Fe levels."
https://openalex.org/W2142467481,"Inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptors (IP(3)Rs) are intracellular channel proteins that mediate Ca(2+) release from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and are involved in many biological processes and diseases. IP(3)Rs are differentially regulated by a variety of cytosolic proteins, but their regulation by ER lumenal protein(s) remains largely unexplored. In this study, we found that ERp44, an ER lumenal protein of the thioredoxin family, directly interacts with the third lumenal loop of IP(3)R type 1 (IP(3)R1) and that the interaction is dependent on pH, Ca(2+) concentration, and redox state: the presence of free cysteine residues in the loop is required. Ca(2+)-imaging experiments and single-channel recording of IP(3)R1 activity with a planar lipid bilayer system demonstrated that IP(3)R1 is directly inhibited by ERp44. Thus, ERp44 senses the environment in the ER lumen and modulates IP(3)R1 activity accordingly, which should in turn contribute to regulating both intralumenal conditions and the complex patterns of cytosolic Ca(2+) concentrations."
https://openalex.org/W1969707555,"The transition from juvenile to adult life is accompanied by programmed remodeling in many tissues and organs, which is key for organisms to adapt to the demand of the environment. Here we report a novel regulated alternative splicing program that is crucial for postnatnal heart remodeling in the mouse. We identify the essential splicing factor ASF/SF2 as a key component of the program, regulating a restricted set of tissue-specific alternative splicing events during heart remodeling. Cardiomyocytes deficient in ASF/SF2 display an unexpected hypercontraction phenotype due to a defect in postnatal splicing switch of the Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent kinase IIδ (CaMKIIδ) transcript. This failure results in mistargeting of the kinase to sarcolemmal membranes, causing severe excitation-contraction coupling defects. Our results validate ASF/SF2 as a fundamental splicing regulator in the reprogramming pathway and reveal the central contribution of ASF/SF2-regulated CaMKIIδ alternative splicing to functional remodeling in developing heart."
https://openalex.org/W2040123418,"The rifting of continents and evolution of ocean basins is a fundamental component of plate tectonics, yet the process of continental break-up remains controversial. Plate driving forces have been estimated to be as much as an order of magnitude smaller than those required to rupture thick continental lithosphere1,2. However, Buck1 has proposed that lithospheric heating by mantle upwelling and related magma production could promote lithospheric rupture at much lower stresses. Such models of mechanical versus magma-assisted extension can be tested, because they predict different temporal and spatial patterns of crustal and upper-mantle structure. Changes in plate deformation produce strain-enhanced crystal alignment and increased melt production within the upper mantle, both of which can cause seismic anisotropy3. The Northern Ethiopian Rift is an ideal place to test break-up models because it formed in cratonic lithosphere with minor far-field plate stresses4,5. Here we present evidence of seismic anisotropy in the upper mantle of this rift zone using observations of shear-wave splitting. Our observations, together with recent geological data, indicate a strong component of melt-induced anisotropy with only minor crustal stretching, supporting the magma-assisted rifting model in this area of initially cold, thick continental lithosphere."
https://openalex.org/W2072008436,"Frizzled (Fz) proteins are serpentine receptors that transduce critical cellular signals during development. Serpentine receptors usually signal to downstream effectors through an associated trimeric G protein complex. However, clear evidence for the role of trimeric G protein complexes for the Fz family of receptors has hitherto been lacking. Here, we show roles for the Gαo subunit (Go) in mediating the two distinct pathways transduced by Fz receptors in Drosophila: the Wnt and planar polarity pathways. Go is required for transduction of both pathways, and epistasis experiments suggest that it is an immediate transducer of Fz. While overexpression effects of the wild-type form are receptor dependent, the activated form (Go-GTP) can signal when the receptor is removed. Thus, Go is likely part of a trimeric G protein complex that directly tranduces Fz signals from the membrane to downstream components."

These discoveries confirm fundamental predictions of globular cluster and binary system evolution. Thirteen of the new MSPs are in binaries, of which two show eclipses and two have highly eccentric orbits. The relativistic periastron advance for the two eccentric systems indicates that at least one of these pulsars has a mass 1.68 times greater than the mass of the Sun at 95% confidence. Such large neutron star masses constrain the equation of state of matter at or beyond the nuclear equilibrium density."
https://openalex.org/W2140348457,"In mammals, hair cell loss causes irreversible hearing and balance impairment because hair cells are terminally differentiated and do not regenerate spontaneously. By profiling gene expression in developing mouse vestibular organs, we identified the retinoblastoma protein (pRb) as a candidate regulator of cell cycle exit in hair cells. Differentiated and functional mouse hair cells with a targeted deletion of Rb1 undergo mitosis, divide, and cycle, yet continue to become highly differentiated and functional. Moreover, acute loss of Rb1 in postnatal hair cells caused cell cycle reentry. Manipulation of the pRb pathway may ultimately lead to mammalian hair cell regeneration."
https://openalex.org/W1965876049,"Apoptosis is a highly coordinated cell suicide mechanism in vertebrates. Phosphorylation of serine 14 of histone H2B, catalyzed by Mst1 kinase, has been linked to chromatin compaction during apoptosis. We extend these results to unicellular eukaryotes by demonstrating that H2B is specifically phosphorylated at serine 10 (S10) in a hydrogen peroxide-induced cell death pathway in S. cerevisiae. H2B S10A mutants are resistant to cell death elicited by H2O2 while H2B S10E phospho-site mimics promote cell death and induce the “constitutive” formation of condensed chromatin. Ste20 kinase, a yeast homolog of mammalian Mst1 kinase, translocates into the nucleus in a caspase-independent fashion and directly phosphorylates H2B at S10. Conservation of targeted H2B phosphorylation and the enzyme system responsible for the process point to an ancient mechanism of chromatin remodeling that likely plays an important role in governing cellular homeostasis in a wide range of organisms."

We report that a CR dietary regimen prevents Abeta peptides generation and neuritic plaque deposition in the brain of a mouse model of AD neuropathology through mechanisms associated with promotion of anti-amyloidogenic alpha-secretase activity. Study findings support existing epidemiological evidence indicating that caloric intake may influence risk for AD and raises the possibility that CR may be used in preventative measures aimed at delaying the onset of AD amyloid neuropathology.
https://openalex.org/W2084080552,"Axon-dendrite polarity is a cardinal feature of neuronal morphology essential for information flow. Here we report a differential distribution of GSK-3β activity in the axon versus the dendrites. A constitutively active GSK-3β mutant inhibited axon formation, whereas multiple axons formed from a single neuron when GSK-3β activity was reduced by pharmacological inhibitors, a peptide inhibitor, or siRNAs. An active mechanism for maintaining neuronal polarity was revealed by the conversion of preexisting dendrites into axons upon GSK-3 inhibition. Biochemical and functional data show that the Akt kinase and the PTEN phosphatase are upstream of GSK-3β in determining neuronal polarity. Our results demonstrate that there are active mechanisms for maintaining as well as establishing neuronal polarity, indicate that GSK-3β relays signaling from Akt and PTEN to play critical roles in neuronal polarity, and suggest that application of GSK-3β inhibitors can be a novel approach to promote generation of new axons after neural injuries."

https://openalex.org/W2044750332,"Microtubules of the mitotic spindle form the structural basis for chromosome segregation. In metaphase, microtubules show high dynamic instability, which is thought to aid the 'search and capture' of chromosomes for bipolar alignment on the spindle. Microtubules suddenly become more stable at the onset of anaphase, but how this change in microtubule behaviour is regulated and how important it is for the ensuing chromosome segregation are unknown. Here we show that in the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, activation of the phosphatase Cdc14 at anaphase onset is both necessary and sufficient for silencing microtubule dynamics. Cdc14 is activated by separase, the protease that triggers sister chromatid separation, linking the onset of anaphase to microtubule stabilization. If sister chromatids separate in the absence of Cdc14 activity, microtubules maintain high dynamic instability; this correlates with defects in both the movement of chromosomes to the spindle poles (anaphase A) and the elongation of the anaphase spindle (anaphase B). Cdc14 promotes localization of microtubule-stabilizing proteins to the anaphase spindle, and dephosphorylation of the kinetochore component Ask1 contributes to both the silencing of microtubule turnover and successful anaphase A."

We replaced the wild-type gene that encodes the NADP-dependent IDH of Escherichia coli with an engineered gene that possesses the ancestral NAD-dependent phenotype. The engineered enzyme is disfavored during competition for acetate. The selection intensifies in genetic backgrounds where other sources of reduced NADP have been removed. A survey of sequenced prokaryotic genomes reveals that those genomes that encode isocitrate lyase, which is essential for growth on acetate, always have an NADP-dependent IDH. Those with only an NAD-dependent IDH never have isocitrate lyase. Hence, the NADP dependence of prokaryotic IDH is an ancient adaptation to anabolic demand for reduced NADP during growth on acetate."
https://openalex.org/W1990865116,"Glutathione peroxidase (GPx, EC 1.11.1.9) protects cells against oxidative damage by catalyzing the reduction of hydroperoxides with glutathione (GSH). Several attempts have been made to imitate its function for mechanical study and for its pharmacological development as an antioxidant. By replacing the active site serine 9 with a cysteine and then substituting it with selenocysteine in a cysteine auxotrophic system, catalytically essential residue selenocysteine was bioincorporated into GSH-specific binding scaffold, and thus, glutathione S-transferase (GST, EC 2.5.1.18) from Lucilia cuprina was converted into a selenium-containing enzyme, seleno-LuGST1-1, by genetic engineering. Taking advantage of the important structure similarities between seleno-LuGST1-1 and naturally occurring GPx in the specific GSH binding sites and the geometric conformation for the active selenocysteine in their common GSH binding domain-adopted thioredoxin fold, the as-generated selenoenzyme displayed a significantly high efficiency for catalyzing the reduction of hydrogen peroxide by glutathione, being comparable with those of natural GPxs. The catalytic behaviors of this engineered selenoenzyme were found to be similar to those of naturally occurring GPx. It exhibited pH and temperature-dependent catalytic activity and a typical ping-pong kinetic mechanism. Engineering GST into an efficient GPx-like biocatalyst provided new proof for the previous assumption that both GPx and GST were evolved from a common thioredoxin-like ancestor to accommodate different functions throughout evolution.

Glutathione peroxidase (GPx, 1The abbreviations used are: GPx, glutathione peroxidase; GSH, glutathione; Sec, selenocysteine; GST, glutathione S-transferase; seleno-GST, selenium-containing GST; LuGST1-1, recombination of GST1 from L. cuprina; seleno-LuGST1-1, selenium-containing LuGST1-1; MALDI-TOF, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight. EC.1.11.1.9) is a selenoenzyme that functions to catalyze the reduction of hydroperoxides using glutathione (GSH) as a reducing substrate (1Cotgreave I.A. Moldeus P. Brattsand R. Hallberg A. Andersson C.M. Engman L. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1992; 43: 793-802Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). It therefore plays an important role in the organismal antioxidant defense mechanism protecting cells from oxidative stress, which is responsible for many diseases such as reperfusion injury, brain ischemia, tumor, cataract, inflammation, and physiological aging. Extensive investigations of the structure and the catalytic mechanism of GPx reveal that a selenocysteine (Sec) residue is in the enzyme active site and thus participates in GPx activity. In the catalytic cycle, the selenol in the reduced Sec residue is oxidized by hydroperoxide to produce the selenenic acid, which is further converted to the selenenyl sulfide by the nucleophilic attack of GSH. Reaction of selenenyl sulfide with second equivalent of GSH regenerates the reduced selenol (2Flohé L. Coenzymes and Cofactors: Glutathione: Chemical, Biochemical, and Medical Aspects. John Wiley & Sons, New York1989: 644-731Google Scholar). Because the Sec is encoded by a stop codon UGA, it is difficult to prepare GPx with traditional recombinant DNA technology. To imitate GPx properties, Sec has been incorporated into some natural enzymes by chemical modification or genetic engineering in an auxotrophic expression system (3Wu Z.P. Hilvert D. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1990; 112: 5647-5648Crossref Scopus (211) Google Scholar, 4Boschi-Muller S. Muller S. Dorsselaer A.V. Böck A. Branlant G. FEBS Lett. 1998; 439: 241-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The first semisynthetic GPx-like selenoenzyme is selenosubtilisin, which was generated by chemical conversion of the catalytically active residue serine (Ser-221) of subtilisin to Sec. Alternatively, the biosynthetic substitution of the catalytically essential residue cysteine (Cys-149) of phosphorylating glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase by Sec led to selenoglyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, which displayed the GPx-like properties. However, the mechanism that these two selenoenzymes applied to catalyze the reduction of hydroperoxide involves use of aryl thiols instead of GSH as reducing substrate due to the lack of a GSH-specific binding site in their active sites. To enhance the GPx activities, the GSH binding site has been successfully introduced into GPx mimics using monoclonal antibody (5Ding L. Liu Z. Zhu Z.Q. Luo G.M. Zhao D.Q. Ni J.Z. Biochem. J. 1998; 332: 251-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) and bioimprinting techniques (6Liu J.Q. Luo G.M. Gao S.J. Zhang K. Chen X.F. Shen J.C. Chem. Commun. 1999; 20: 199-200Crossref Scopus (52) Google Scholar), and the as-synthesized selenoantibody and bioimprinted selenoprotein containing the GSH binding site exhibited high GPx activities. Besides the efficient binding of substrates, however, some other factors, such as the correct geometric conformation and the microenvironment of the active site, are also dominant for the enhancement of enzyme catalysis. Thus, it is challenging to generate novel models that are more suitable for GPx catalysis. Intensive studies of protein structures have revealed that the evolution of proteins for novel functions is largely based on the redesign of existing protein frameworks in nature (7Mannervik B. Cameron A.D. Fernandez E. Gustafsson A. Hansson L.O. Jemth P. Jiang F. Jones T.A. Larsson A.K. Nilsson L.O. Olin B. Pettersson P.L. Ridderström M. Stenberg G. Widersten M. Chem.-Biol.

This principle can be exploited in generation of novel GPx-like biocatalyst by redesigning existing protein scaffolds that are similar to that of natural GPx. Glutathione S-transferases (GSTs, EC 2.5.1.18) are a family of multifunctional proteins capable of detoxifying endogenous and xenobiotic electrophiles by addition of GSH to the electrophiles (9Armstrong R.N. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1997; 10: 2-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (969) Google Scholar, 10Dirr H.W. Reinemer P. Huber R. Eur. J.

Owing to their modular features, their stability, ease of purification, and the wealth of accumulated knowledge of their structure-activity relationship, GSTs have been used as ideal candidates to redesign novel binding properties and catalytic functions (9Armstrong R.N. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1997; 10: 2-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (969) Google Scholar, 12Qi D. Tann C.M. Haring D. Distefano M.D. Chem. Rev. 2001; 101: 3081-3111Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar, 13DeSantis G. Jones J.B. Curr. Opin. Biotechnol. 1999; 10: 324-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). GSTs are divided into different classes according to the sequence similarity, but all of their structures consist of two domains, a conserved GSH binding site at the N terminus and a hypervariable hydrophobic xenobiotic substrates binding site at the C terminus (9Armstrong R.N. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1997; 10: 2-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (969) Google Scholar, 10Dirr H.W. Reinemer P. Huber R. Eur. J.

GSTs and GPxs both belong to the thioredoxin superfamily (also including thioredoxin, glutaredoxin, and disulfide-bond formation facilitator) classified by the common glutathione binding domain-adopted thioredoxin fold (9Armstrong R.N. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1997; 10: 2-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (969) Google Scholar, 14Martin J.L. Structure. 1995; 3: 245-250Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (694) Google Scholar). Their active site residues (Tyr or Ser in GST and Sec in GPx) that interact with the thiol group of the substrate glutathione hold the similar positions in their protein structures (14Martin J.L. Structure. 1995; 3: 245-250Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (694) Google Scholar). Moreover, several GSTs display GPx-like catalytic properties toward organic hydroperoxides, although they do not catalyze the reduction of hydrogen peroxide (15Mannervik B. Methods Enzymol. 1985; 113: 490-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). Accordingly, GSTs appear to offer model protein scaffolds to confer GPx properties by engineering Sec residue into the GSH binding sites. Recently, we have successfully converted the rat θ-class glutathione transferase T2-2 into a selenoenzyme by chemically modifying the active site Ser to Sec (16Ren X. Jemth P. Board P.G. Luo G. Mannervik B. Liu J. Zhang K. Shen J. Chem. Biol. 2002; 9: 789-794Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). This novel selenium-containing enzyme displayed dramatically high GPx activities for catalyzing the reduction of hydrogen peroxide by GSH. However, because the chemical modification is incapable of specifically targeting amino acid residues in the active site, other hydroxyl groups in the protein are inevitably converted into selenols, which would hamper the further structure-function studies of this important selenoenzyme. In view of this, genetic engineering should provide a better and more suitable alternative to incorporate Sec into the defined GST binding site. Here, we report the conversion of Australian sheep blowfly (Lucilia cuprina) glutathione transferase (LuGST1-1) to selenoenzyme (seleno-LuGST1-1) by means of genetic engineering. The serine 9 in the active site of the LuGST1-1 was mutated to cysteine and then biosynthetically substituted to selenocysteine in an auxotrophic expression system. The as-generated novel selenium-dependent enzyme exhibited high catalytic activity toward the reduction of H2O2 by GSH, which is in the same order of magnitude compared with natural GPx. For the first time, a selenium-containing enzyme with such remarkable GPx activity was generated by genetic engineering in bacteria. Bacterial Strains, Plasmids, and Media—Strains and plasmids used in this study are listed in Table I. The media employed in cultivation and expression experiments were two types of modifications of M9 minimal medium as described previously (17Muller S. Senn H. Gsell B. Vetter W. Baron C. Böck A.

Plasmid isolation, DNA restriction endonuclease analysis, ligation, and transformation were performed as described previously (18Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The Qiagen minipreps DNA purification system and Biotech DNA clean-up system were used to prepare plasmid DNA for restriction enzyme digestion and recover DNA fragment from low melting agarose gels, respectively. Oligonucleotide-directed Mutagenesis and Construction of Vectors—Mutations in gst1-1 were introduced by overlap PCR. Plasmid pLUC-1-EX was used as the template to obtain mutants. The mutagenic oligonucleotides used were as follows. The gst S9C was amplified using primers S9CF (5′-GCCGCATATGGATTTCTACTACTTGCCCGGTTGCACTCCCTACCACTC-3′) and RCBamHI (5′-CCGGATCCTTAGTTGAAGAATTTC-3′). The amplified gst S9C fragment was used as a template for the next PCR reaction. C86S and C200S were introduced using primers as follows: FndeI (5′-GCCGCATATGGATTTCTACTACTTG-3′), C86SF (5′-TCCCCAAGTCCCCCAAGAAG-3′), C86SRC (5′-TTCTTGGGGGACTTGGGGAAC-3′), RCBamHI (5′-CCGGATCCTTAGTTGAAGAATTTC-3′), and C200SRC (5′-CCGGATCCTTAGTTGAAGAATTTCTTGAATTCCAAGGAACCTTC-3′). Substitutions that resulted in mutation are underlined. The amplified fragments gst S9C and gst S9C/C86/200S had an NdeI site and a BamHI site at the 5′ and 3′ termini, respectively, which were introduced by these primers. The two fragments were digested with NdeI and BamHI and cloned into pT7-7 yielding plasmids pSM4 and pSM3, respectively. The amplified fragments were sequenced to confirm that no other mutations had been introduced into the sequences by PCR procedure. Overexpression and Purification of Wild Type LuGST1-1 and the Mutants GST(S9C) and GST(S9C C86/200S)—Wild type LuGST1-1 was expressed and purified by affinity chromatography on glutathione-Sepharose 4B as described previously (19Board P.G. Russel R.J. Marano R.J. Oakeshott J.G. Biochem. J. 1994; 299: 425-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Plasmids pSM4 and pSM3 were transformed into BL21(DE3), and the strains were grown in the presence of isopropyl thio-β-d-galactopyranoside to induce expression of mutant GST(S9C) and GST(S9C C86/200S), respectively (21Board P.G. Pierce K. Biochem. J. 1987; 248: 937-941Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). With regard to the purification, the two mutants were passed through DE52 ion-exchange columns and then applied to glutathione-Sepharose 4B columns as described previously (22Board P.G. Coggan M. Wilce M.C.J. Parker M.W. Biochem. J. 1995; 311: 247-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar) with a slight modification. Overexpression and Purification of Seleno-LuGST1-1—Plasmid pSM3 were transformed into strain BL21cysE51. Overexpression of seleno-LuGST1-1 in the presence of selenocysteine was performed as already described for (Se)2-thioredoxin (17Muller S. Senn H. Gsell B. Vetter W. Baron C. Böck A. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 3404-3412Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). And the protein was also purified by affinity chromatography on glutathione-Sepharose 4B as described previously (19Board P.G. Russel R.J. Marano R.J. Oakeshott J.G. Biochem. J. 1994; 299: 425-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) with a slight modification. After elution from the affinity column with 5 mm GSH in 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 9.6, the enzyme fraction was dialyzed and applied to the Sephadex G-25 column. The enzyme fraction was collected, dialyzed again, and lyophilized. Determination of Protein Concentration—Protein concentration was determined by a Bio-Rad protein assay using bovine serum albumin as a standard following the method of Bradford (23Bradford M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar). The electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) was carried out on a Hoefer Mighty Small II electrophoresis unit according to the protocols from the manufacturer (40Biotech Amersham Pharmacia Hoefer Scientific Instruments Manual. Hoefer Scientific, UK1992-1993: 5-11Google Scholar). Electrospray Mass Spectrometry Analysis—All MALDI-TOF mass spectra were acquired on a Voyager DE-STR Biospectrometry workstation (PerSeptive Biosystems, Framingham, MA) using a nitrogen laser (337 nm). The protein samples were purified by high-performance liquid chromatography and prepared using a conventional dried droplet protocol in which sinapin acid was used as the matrix. The sinapin acid matrix was prepared as a saturated, aqueous solution that contained 60% acetonitrile and 0.3% trifluoroacetic acid. An aliquot sample of 1 μl was mixed with 20 μl of sinapin acid matrix before depositing 1.2 μl of the sample matrix mixture on the MALDI sample stage. Binding Experiments—Binding of GSH to seleno-LuGST1-1 was studied as described previously (24Caccuri A.M. Antonini G. Nicotra M. Battistoni A. Bello M.L. Board P.G. Parker M.W. Ricci G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29681-29686Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Assay of Enzyme Activities—The activities of enzymes were measured using a UV-visible spectrophotometer (Shimadzu UV-3100). The GPx activities of enzymes were measured according to Wilson's method (25Wilson S.R. Zucker P.A. Huang R.R.C. Spector A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1989; 111: 5936-5939Crossref Scopus (413) Google Scholar). The reaction was carried out at 37 °C in 500 μl of solution containing 50 mm, pH 7.0, potassium phosphate buffer, 1 mm GSH, 1 unit of GSH reductase, and 0.5-2.5 μg of enzyme. The mixture was preincubated for 7 min, and 0.25 mm NADPH solution was added. After the mixture was incubated for 3 min at 37 °C, the reaction was initiated by addition of 0.5 mm hydrogen peroxide. The activity was determined by the decrease of NADPH absorption at 340 nm. Background absorption was run without enzyme and was subtracted. The activity unit of enzyme is defined as the amount of enzyme that catalyzes the turnover of 1 μmol of NADPH per min. The specific activity is expressed in μmol·min-1·μmol-1 of enzyme. The GST activities of wild type LuGST1-1 and its various mutants were measured as described by Habig (26Habig W.H. Jakoby W.B. Methods Enzymol. 1981; 77: 398-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (2098) Google Scholar). The reaction was carried out at 30 °C in 1 ml of solution containing 100 mm, pH 6.5, sodium phosphate buffer, 1 mm GSH, and 0.5-5 μg of enzyme. After preincubation for 3 min, 1 mm 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene was added and then the absorbance was recorded at 340 nm for 3 min. Background absorption was run without enzyme and was subtracted. The activity unit of enzyme is defined as the amount of enzyme that catalyzes the turnover of 1 μmol of 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene per min. The specific activity is expressed in μmol·min-1·μmol-1 of enzyme. Determination of Optimal pH and Temperature for Seleno-LuGST1-1 Catalysis—The initial rates were measured using 1 mm GSH and 0.5 mm hydrogen peroxide. The pH value of the buffer was changed from 6.0 to 10.0 to determine the initial rates of the reaction to obtain the optimal pH condition for seleno-LuGST1-1-catalyzed reaction. Similarly, a catalytic reaction was carried out at different temperatures from 20 °C to 45 °C to determine the optimal temperature for the seleno-LuGST1-1-catalyzed reduction of hydroperoxide. Steady-state Kinetics of Seleno-LuGST1-1—The assay of kinetics of seleno-LuGST1-1 for the reduction of H2O2 by GSH was similar to that of selenium-containing catalytic antibody, Se-4A4 (5Ding L. Liu Z. Zhu Z.Q. Luo G.M. Zhao D.Q. Ni J.Z. Biochem. J. 1998; 332: 251-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The initial rates were measured by observing the decrease of NADPH absorption at 340 nm at several concentrations of one substrate while the concentration of the second substrate was kept constant. All kinetic experiments were performed in a total volume of 0.5 ml containing 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0), 1 mm EDTA, 1 unit of GSH reductase, 0.25 mm NADPH, and varying concentrations of GSH, H2O2, and seleno-LuGST1-1. After the enzyme was preincubated with GSH, NADPH, and GSH reductase, the reaction was then initiated by the addition of H2O2. Subtraction of the nonenzymatic background absorption gave the rate of the enzyme-catalyzed reaction. Production and Isolation of Seleno-LuGST1-1—The method used was based on the assumption that an efficient charging of tRNACys occurred with selenocysteine when cysteine was omitted (17Muller S. Senn H. Gsell B. Vetter W. Baron C. Böck A. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 3404-3412Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Thus, Cys could be substituted efficiently by Sec in a cysteine auxotrophic strain when Cys was omitted in the growth medium. In the case of LuGST1-1 from the Australian sheep blowfly (L. cuprina), the active residue Ser-9 was mutated to Cys and then converted to Sec during expression in the auxotrophic strain. However, because there are two other cysteines in this protein, i.e. the Cys-86 and the Cys-200, interpretation of kinetic data would be hampered if all the three cysteines were substituted by Sec. Therefore, before introducing selenocysteine at position 9, the other two cysteines were changed into serines. Since their positions are apart from the active site and they don't form a disulfide bridge, the substitutions were expected to have no effect on protein folding and catalytic activity. Analysis of the results of SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1) indicated that seleno-LuGST1-1 was about 13% of all the proteins expressed in the strain. Inclusion bodies and soluble form of seleno-LuGST1-1 were produced simultaneously in the expression. The yield of soluble seleno-LuGST1-1 purified from the soluble protein was about 1.13 mg/liter of culture. Biochemical Characterization of the Purified Protein—The purified selenoenzyme sample was characterized by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. The MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry results revealed that there were two enzymes components in the sample. The mass of the main component was 38,811 Da, which was predicted for the ESeO2H form. The minor peak (38,651 Da) was identified as the mutant (S9C C86/200S). Based on the relative peak intensities (curves not shown), it was estimated that the protein sample was composed of 70% seleno-LuGST1-1 and 30% GST (S9C C86/200S) mutants. Similar yields were also reported for (Se)2-thioredoxin (17Muller S. Senn H. Gsell B. Vetter W. Baron C. Böck A. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 3404-3412Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar) and selenoglyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (4Boschi-Muller S. Muller S. Dorsselaer A.V. Böck A. Branlant G. FEBS Lett. 1998; 439: 241-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Binding Experiments—For seleno-LuGST1-1, the dissociation constant of GSH at pH 6.5 was determined to be 104 μm, which was approximately the same as that of wild type LuGST1-1, 107 μm. This result suggests that substitution of the hydroxyl group of Ser-9 has no effect on the affinity toward GSH, which has also been proved by the mutant GST S9C (24Caccuri A.M. Antonini G. Nicotra M.

Peroxidase and Transferase Activities of Seleno-LuGST1-1—The GPx and GST activities of seleno-LuGST1-1 and other catalysts are listed in Table II. The glutathione transferase activity of seleno-LuGST1-1 (23.5 μmol·min-1·μmol-1) was one order of magnitude lower than that of wild type LuGST1-1 (355.3 μmol·min-1·μmol-1) when 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene was used as the substrate, and the two GST mutants (S9C and S9C C86/200S) displayed no GST activities under the same conditions due to the removal of the active hydroxyl group of Ser-9, which could form a hydrogen-bond with the thiol group of GSH to stabilize the ionized GSH and therefore enhance the nucleophilicity of GSH (24Caccuri A.M.

Open table in a new tab The GPx activities of the wild type LuGST1-1, GST mutants (S9C and S9C C86/200S), and seleno-LuGST1-1 were estimated by a coupled enzyme system under the same conditions. LuGST1-1 and its two mutants exhibited no evident GPx activity, whereas the purified selenoenzyme displayed a remarkably activity of 2957 μmol·min-1·μmol-1. Because the cysteine-containing mutant (S9C C86/200S, 30% in the purified selenoenzyme) did not catalyze the reduction of hydroperoxide by GSH, all the activity of the purified selenoenzyme should be attributed to the seleno-LuGST1-1 (70% in the purified selenoenzyme). Accordingly, the high GPx activity of the purified selenoenzyme should result from the conversion of Cys-9 to Sec in the auxotrophic strain instead of the three mutations (S9C, C86S, and C200S). Seleno-LuGST1-1 was found to be much more efficient than most of other GPx mimics for the reduction of H2O2 by GSH. For instance, it was at least 500-fold and 2900-fold more efficient than the first semisynthetic selenoenzyme, selenosubtilisin and the well known model compound ebselen (27Mugesh G. Singh H.B. Chem. Soc. Rev. 2000; 29: 347-357Crossref Scopus (605) Google Scholar), which exhibited GPx activities of only 4.6 μmol·min-1·μmol-1 and 0.99 μmol·min-1·μmol-1, respectively (as shown in Table II). Its activity was even comparable with those of some natural GPxs, such as rabbit liver GPx (28Ma W. Luo G. Yang T. Sheng Wu Hua Hsueh Tsa Chinh. 1993; 9: 234-236Google Scholar), bovine liver GPx (29Chu F.F. Doroshow J.H. Esworthy R.S. J. Biol.

Chem. 1993; 268: 2571-2576Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and human plasma pGPx (30Yamamoto Y. Takahashi K. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 305: 541-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar) whose activities were in the order of 102-103 μmol·min-1·μmol-1. The Optimal pH and Temperature for Seleno-LuGST1-1-catalyzed Reduction of Hydrogen Peroxide by GSH—The GPx activity of seleno-LuGST1-1 was examined over the pH range from 6.0 to 10.0 and the temperature range from 20.0 to 45.0 °C. As shown in Fig. 2, pH and temperature profiles of seleno-LuGST1-1 activity were similar to those exhibited by natural GPx (30Yamamoto Y. Takahashi K. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 305: 541-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Seleno-LuGST1-1 had an optimal pH of 9.0, which was close to that of natural GPx (8.8) (31Flohé L. Eisele B. Wendel A. Hoppe-Seyler's Z. Physiol. Chem. 1971; 353: 151-158Crossref Scopus (71) Google Scholar), and a temperature optimum of 41.2 °C, which was lower than that of natural GPx (50 °C) (31Flohé L. Eisele B. Wendel A. Hoppe-Seyler's Z. Physiol. Chem. 1971; 353: 151-158Crossref Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The activities of seleno-LuGST1-1 at 37 °C and at pH 7.0 were only 30 and 13% of their maximums: 22,746 (at 41.2 °C) and 9,857 μmol·min-1·μmol-1 (at pH 9.0), respectively. Steady-state Kinetics and Catalytic Mechanism of Seleno-LuGST1-1—The initial rates for H2O2 reduction catalyzed by seleno-LuGST1-1 were determined as a function of substrate concentration at 37.0 °C and pH 7.0 when the concentration of one substrate was varied and that of the other was fixed. Michaelis-Menten kinetics was observed unde"

Among reactive oxygen and nitrogen species of importance in red blood cell (RBC) homeostasis, superoxide and nitric oxide radicals play a key role. In the present work, we evaluated subcellular effects induced by peroxynitrite, the product of the fast reaction between superoxide and nitric oxide. Peroxynitrite induced 1) oxidation of oxyhemoglobin to methemoglobin, 2) cytoskeleton rearrangement, 3) ultrastructural alterations, and 4) altered expression of band-3 and decreased expression of glycophorin A. With respect to control cells, this occurred in a significantly higher percentage of human RBC (approximately 40%). The presence of antioxidants inhibited these modifications. Furthermore, besides these senescence-associated changes, other important modifications, absent in control RBC and usually associated with apoptotic cell death, were detected in a small but significant subset of peroxynitrite-exposed RBC (approximately 7%). Active protease cathepsin E and mu-calpain increased; activation of caspase 2 and caspase 3 was detected; and phosphatidylserine externalization, an early marker of apoptosis, was observed. Conversely, inhibition of cathepsin E, mu-calpain, as well as caspase 2 and 3 by specific inhibitors resulted in a significant impairment of erythrocyte ""apoptosis"" Altogether, these results indicate that peroxynitrite, a milestone of redox-mediated damage in human pathology, can hijack human RBC toward senescence and apoptosis by a mechanism involving both cysteinyl and aspartyl proteases."

https://openalex.org/W2047500542,"Transcriptional silencing is a phenomenon in which the transcription of a gene by RNA polymerase II or III is repressed or not, dependent only on the gene's chromosomal location. Two prevailing models exist for silencing: (1) steric hindrance in silenced chromatin inhibits the binding of upstream activator proteins or polymerase or (2) silencing primarily blocks steps downstream of transcription preinitiation complex formation. Here, we test these models quantitatively for the case of SIR2-dependent silencing in budding yeast, using foreign and endogenous reporter proteins, at transgenic and endogenous loci. Our results contradict both models and show instead that transcriptional silencing at several URA3 transgenes, and at the naturally silenced endogenous HMRa and HMLα mating type genes, acts downstream of gene activator protein binding to strongly reduce the occupancy of TFIIB, RNA polymerase II, and TFIIE at the silenced promoters."

All organisms replicate DNA in a semidiscontinuous fashion (1Kornberg A. Baker T.A. DNA Replication. 2nd Ed. W. H. Freeman & Co., New York1992Google Scholar). At each replication fork, one of the parental strands is the template for synthesis of an uninterrupted leading strand. The other strand is replicated as short Okazaki fragments that are later joined to generate a contiguous lagging strand (2Ogawa T. Okazaki T. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1980; 49: 421-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar).

Although there is no high resolution structure reported for the intact hexameric DnaB, the structure of its smaller N-terminal domain has been determined both by NMR spectroscopy (12Weigelt J. Brown S.E. Miles C.S. Dixon N.E. Otting G. Structure. 1999; 7: 681-690Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) and x-ray crystallography (13Fass D. Bogden C.E. Berger J.M. Structure. 1999; 7: 691-698Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). These structures were recently used in conjunction with the known crystal structure of the helicase domain of the related hexameric bacteriophage T7 gp4 helicase-primase (14Sawaya M.R. Guo S. Tabor S. Richardson C.C. Ellenberger T. Cell. 1999; 99: 167-177Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar) to model structures into electron density maps of DnaB6 produced by image reconstruction from negative stain electron microscopy data (15Yang S. Yu X. VanLoock M.S. Jezewska M.J. Bujalowski W. Egelman E.H. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 321: 839-849Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). It is generally accepted that the C-terminal face of DnaB6 is directed into the replication fork and contains the site of strand separation, whereas the N-terminal face points away from the fork where it would be appropriately placed to interact with the DnaG primase (16Keck J.L. Roche D.D. Lynch A.S. Berger J.M. Science. 2000; 287: 2482-2486Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 17Frick D.N. Richardson C.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 39-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). Priming of Okazaki fragment synthesis on the lagging strand requires helicase-primase interaction. Although E. coli primase appears to be repeatedly recruited to the lagging strand by transient interaction with the helicase (18Tougu K. Peng H. Marians K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4675-4682Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the interaction between the Bacillus stearothermophilus homologs is sufficiently stable that a complex of the helicase with two or three molecules of primase can be isolated (19Bird L.E.

Primase is composed of an N-terminal zinc-binding domain that mediates interaction with the ssDNA template (21Stamford N.P.J. Lilley P.E. Dixon N.E. Biochim. Biophys.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 4205-4213Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar), and a C-terminal domain (residues 434–581) that interacts with DnaB6 (23Tougu K. Marians K.J. J. Biol.

Biol. 2000; 300: 353-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) have been published, the structure of the C-terminal domain (also termed p16, and here designated DnaG-C) has not previously been reported. Studies of the structure and function of the DnaG-C domain have been restricted due to difficulty in expressing it in E. coli, presumably because it binds (and thus inactivates) DnaB in competition with the full-length primase (18Tougu K. Peng H. Marians K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4675-4682Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23Tougu K. Marians K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21391-21397Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Mutations in the extreme C-terminal 16 residues of primase led to defects in its function in DnaB-dependent in vitro replication reactions, suggesting that this region, at least, makes contacts with the helicase (23Tougu K. Marians K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21391-21397Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 27Tougu K. Marians K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21398-21405Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Whereas previous studies showed that a glutathione S-transferase-DnaG-C fusion protein is capable alone of interacting with DnaB6 (24Lu Y.-B. Ratnakar P.V. A.L. Mohanty B.K. Bastia D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 12902-12907Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), there has been no physical demonstration that this interaction is mediated solely by the C-terminal domain of primase. Here we report thermodynamic parameters and stoichiometry, determined by surface plasmon resonance (SPR) measurements, for the association of DnaG-C with DnaB6. The data demonstrate that the C-terminal domain is largely, if not completely, responsible for primase-helicase interactions and that up to three DnaG-C molecules are able to bind noncooperatively to the helicase hexamer. The crystal structure of DnaG-C, determined at 2.8-Å resolution, shows that the protein is an elongated molecule composed of two globular subdomains connected by a long helix. It exists in the crystalline state as an asymmetric dimer of subunits with two different conformations resulting from bending of the connecting helix at different positions, indicating that this helix is rather flexible. NMR spectroscopy was used to demonstrate in solution that a monomer-dimer equilibrium exists at high concentrations, that the connecting helix persists and appears to be straight in the monomer, and that one of the crystal conformers is most highly populated in the dimer. Thus, the other crystal conformer appears to be trapped in the solid state by crystal packing forces. Protein Purification—Overproduction of DnaG, DnaG-(1–433), and DnaG-C was achieved in E. coli strains containing plasmid derivatives of vector pCE30, pMA200U (28Elvin C.M. Thompson P.R. Argall M.E. Hendry P. Stamford N.P.J. Lilley P.E. Dixon N.E. Gene (Amst.). 1990; 87: 123-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), or pND706 (29Love C.A. Lilley P.E. Dixon N.E. Gene (Amst.). 1996; 176: 49-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), respectively, with appropriately constructed genes under control of thermoinducible tandem bacteriophage λ pR and pL promoters. Construction of pPL195 (dnaG+) (21Stamford N.P.J. Lilley P.E. Dixon N.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1132: 17-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) and pKL1176 (dnaG-C+) (30Loscha K. Oakley A.J. Bancia B. Schaeffer P.M. Prosselkov P. Otting G. Wilce M.C.J. Dixon N.E. Protein Expression Purif. 2004; 33: 304-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar) have been described. To prepare plasmid pCP806 (dnaG-(1–433)+), the dnaG gene from pPL195 was transferred to the phagemid vector pMA200U, and the single-stranded form was used as template for oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis (31Kunkel T.A. Bebenek K. McClary J. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 204: 125-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (633) Google Scholar) to replace codon 434 of dnaG with a TAA stop codon followed by an EcoRI site. Deletion of an EcoRI fragment downstream of the coding region in pCP806 yielded pCP807, which was used for overproduction of DnaG-(1–433) (see Supplemental Data for details). Unlabeled, uniformly 13C, 15N-labeled, and selenomethionine-substituted DnaG-C were purified as described (30Loscha K. Oakley A.J. Bancia B. Schaeffer P.M. Prosselkov P. Otting G. Wilce M.C.J. Dixon N.E. Protein Expression Purif. 2004; 33: 304-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). To avoid the possibility of heterogeneity at the C terminus of the protein, DnaG primase was expressed in a suppressor-free host strain (cf. Ref. 30Loscha K. Oakley A.J. Bancia B. Schaeffer P.M. Prosselkov P. Otting G. Wilce M.C.J. Dixon N.E. Protein Expression Purif. 2004; 33: 304-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Details of procedures for purification of primase and DnaG-(1–433), along with verification of their purity by SDS-PAGE, are given in detail in the Supplemental Data. Concentrations of primase, DnaG-(1–433), and DnaG-C were determined spectrophotometrically at 280 nm, using calculated values of ϵ280 of 43,240, 30,580, and 12,660 m-1 cm-1 respectively (32Gill S.C. von Hippel P.H. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 182: 319-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (5034) Google Scholar). DnaB6 was purified using strain AN1459/pPS562 (6San Martin M.C. Stamford N.P.J. Dammerova N. Dixon N.E. Carazo J.M. J. Struct. Biol. 1995; 114: 167-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Plasmid pPS562 contains a synthetic dnaCB operon under transcriptional control of the tandem λ pR and pL promoters and directs high level overproduction of equimolar amounts of DnaB and DnaC proteins. Concentrations of DnaB6 were determined by the method of Bradford (33Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (214131) Google Scholar), using bovine serum albumin as standard. SPR Measurements—A BIAcore 2000 instrument (Biacore AB, Uppsala, Sweden) was used to study the interactions of DnaB with DnaG as well as its N- and C-terminal domains. All studies were carried out at 20 °C at a flow rate of 5 μl/min. For immobilization onto a CM5 sensor chip (Biacore), proteins were diluted into 10 mm MES (pH 6.0) (for wild-type DnaG) or a mixture of 2 volumes of 10 mm MES (pH 6.0) with 3 volumes of 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4) (for DnaG-(1–433)). All flow cells were activated with a 7-min injection of a freshly prepared aqueous solution of 50 mmN-hydroxysuccinimide and 200 mm 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl) carbodiimide. DnaG was immobilized onto two flow cells to yield increases in response units (RU) of 742 and 1472. DnaG-(1–433) (1220 RU) was immobilized on a third flow cell, and one flow cell served as a control surface (CM5 chip I). All flow cells were then deactivated with 1 m ethanolamine (pH 8.5). The surface of a second CM5 sensor chip (CM5 chip II) was treated similarly to immobilize wild-type DnaG at a low level (380 RU). Wild-type DnaB6 in 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 10 mm MgCl2, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.005% surfactant P20 (BIAcore buffer) at concentrations between 0.21 and 2.11 μm (as subunits) was made to flow during 2 min over the immobilized DnaG on CM5 chip II. Elution was allowed to proceed in the same buffer for 10 min. The flow cells were regenerated by injections (2 min) of 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4). The streptavidin-coated sensor chip (SA chip; Biacore) was activated with three sequential injections of 1 m NaCl, 50 mm NaOH (1 min each). A solution (2 nm) of a 3′-biotinylated oligonucleotide comprising 35 thymidine residues (3′Bio-(dT)35) in BIAcore buffer was used to yield an increase of 61 RU (6 min) on one flow cell. Another flow cell was unmodified and served as a control. DnaB6 was diluted in BIAcore buffer containing 0.1 mm AMP-PNP to 2.11 μm, and 1000 RU were immobilized (10 min) onto 3′Bio-(dT)35. After allowing DnaB to stabilize on 3′Bio-(dT)35 for a further 9.5 min, DnaG was injected over the flow cells during 1 min. After 5 min of dissociation, the flow cells were regenerated by injection of 1 m NaCl, 50 mm NaOH (1 min). This removed DnaB6, which was then reloaded onto the chip for a new cycle. Solutions of increasing concentrations of DnaG primase were tested in this way. The same flow cell was used to investigate the interaction of DnaG-C with ssDNA-bound DnaB6. The binding signal was increased by raising the level of immobilized 3′Bio-(dT)35 to 133 RU. The interaction was monitored as described above, except that 1900 RU of DnaB6 (8.4 min) were immobilized onto the chip, and DnaG-C was injected at various concentrations. The equilibrium dissociation constants (KD) of all complexes were derived from raw data by use of the BIAevaluation software (version 3.2; Biacore). Steady-state data were used to calculate the KD of a complex. Before fitting, binding data were corrected by subtraction of the control response due to simple refractive index change. The RU values of DnaB6 bound onto the 3′Bio-(dT)35 derivatized SA surface were normalized to 1000 RU for DnaG binding or 1900 RU for DnaG-C. The curve of equilibrium response versus [analyte] was fitted to a 1:1 Langmuir binding model. The experimental errors in determined parameters are S.E. values calculated by BIAevaluation. Crystal Structure Determination—Crystals of selenomethionine-substituted DnaG-C were grown by vapor diffusion in hanging drops (2 μl) as described (30Loscha K. Oakley A.J. Bancia B. Schaeffer P.M. Prosselkov P. Otting G. Wilce M.C.J. Dixon N.E. Protein Expression Purif. 2004; 33: 304-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Protein solutions (∼4 mg/ml), initially in 0.05 m sodium acetate buffer (pH 4.6) with 2.5% polyethylene glycol 4000 and 0.1 m ammonium sulfate, were equilibrated at 4 °C over reservoirs containing the same components at twice these concentrations. X-ray data sets were collected at three wavelengths suitable for phasing based on selenium anomalous dispersion as described previously (30Loscha K. Oakley A.J. Bancia B. Schaeffer P.M. Prosselkov P. Otting G. Wilce M.C.J. Dixon N.E. Protein Expression Purif. 2004; 33: 304-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Statistics for anomalous scattering in these data are given in Table I. Since the native protein crystals did not yield useful diffraction, one of the MAD data sets (λ1, 2.8-Å resolution) was used as the reference data set for structure refinement. Initial phase and solvent flattening calculations were conducted in CNS (34Brünger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S.

Maximum likelihood-weighted phases from REFMAC were used for 2mFo - dFc and mFo - dFc electron density map calculations.

Spectra were recorded at 25 °C using a Bruker DMX-600 NMR spectrometer equipped with a triple resonance cryoprobe operating at a 1H NMR frequency of 600 MHz. The backbone resonance assignments were obtained from three-dimensional HNCA, HNCO, (HCA)CONH, CBCA(CO)NH, HNCACB, HN(CA)HA, TOCSY-15N-HSQC, and NOESY-15N-HSQC spectra. {1H}15N-NOE data were recorded on a Varian Inova 600 NMR spectrometer. SPR Analysis of DnaB6 Binding to Immobilized DnaG and DnaG-(1–433)—The interactions of DnaB6 with immobilized full-length DnaG (65,572 Da) and a truncated form lacking the C-terminal domain (DnaG-(1–433), 48889 Da; also termed p49) were first analyzed by SPR (BIAcore). DnaB6 was observed to bind only to surfaces with immobilized DnaG; no response was observed with DnaG-(1–433) even at the highest concentration (2.11 μm, as monomer) of DnaB (Fig. 1A). An equilibrium binding isotherm for the interaction of DnaB6 with immobilized DnaG was obtained using a second sensor chip with a lesser loading of DnaG (Fig. 1B). It gave a good fit to a Langmuir binding model for a 1:1 interaction, with a dissociation constant KD of the DnaB6-DnaG complex of 1.4 ± 0.1 μm (with [DnaB] expressed as concentration of subunits, assuming there are six potential binding sites in the hexamer). The maximum response (Rmax) for DnaB6 binding to this surface indicated that only about 3% of the immobilized DnaG molecules were capable of binding DnaB hexamers. Similarly inefficient and weak binding has been reported previously in a similar experiment (39Yuzhakov A. Turner J. O'Donnell M. Cell. 1996; 86: 877-886Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). The association and dissociation phases were fast, and a large mass transport effect due to the large size of DnaB6 (314 kDa) was expected. Because most of the immobilized primase was inactive, presumably because the DnaB6-binding site was occluded during covalent immobilization, it was not possible to determine the stoichiometry of the complex with this surface. Nevertheless, the interaction appeared to be a specific one, since the addition of 3 μm primase as competitor with 0.21 μm DnaB6 as analyte reduced the SPR response by ∼50%. Moreover, the interaction was observed to be absolutely dependent on the presence of Mg2+. Since hexamerization of DnaB at the concentrations used here is dependent on Mg2+ (40Bujalowski W. Klonowska M.M. Jezewska M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31350-31358Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), this also suggests that only the hexamer is capable of binding primase. Binding of DnaG and DnaG-C to 3′Bio-(dT)35-immobilized DnaB6—The influence of interaction of DnaB6 with ssDNA on its association with primase has not previously been examined directly. For this purpose, we used a 3′-biotinylated oligonucleotide (3′Bio-(dT)35) long enough that it should bind well within the central channel of the helicase but not projecting so far that it could simultaneously interact with DnaB6-bound primase. The helicase was thus immobilized via its interaction with 3′Bio-(dT)35 that had previously been bound to the streptavidin-coated surface of a Biacore SA chip. DnaB6 uses the energy of ATP hydrolysis to move in the 5′–3′ direction on ssDNA. It was found to bind quite stably onto immobilized 3′Bio-(dT)35 in the presence of Mg2+ and the nonhydrolyzable ATP analog, AMP-PNP (Fig. 2, A and B). After the DnaB surfaces had been prepared, analyte solutions containing a range of concentrations of DnaG, DnaG-C, or DnaG-(1–433) were made to flow over them until equilibrium had been reached. Although no binding of DnaG-(1–433) was observed even at a concentration as high as 3.7 μm, both DnaG and DnaG-C were found to interact with ssDNA-bound DnaB6 in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 2). No major artifacts like mass transfer limitations were noted, probably because the sizes of the analytes were relatively small. Although some surface degradation occurred due to slow release of DnaB6, it was negligible in the time frame of the experiments. The binding and dissociation phases for both proteins were complete in <10 s (Fig. 2, A and B), confirming the transience of the DnaB6-DnaG interaction (18Tougu K. Peng H. Marians K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4675-4682Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) but rendering it impossible to determine accurate kinetic parameters. The equilibrium binding isotherm for binding of DnaG-C (Fig. 2C) fit well to a 1:1 binding model, with KD = 4.9 ± 0.3 μm and Rmax that corresponded to binding of 3.14 ± 0.08 molecules of DnaG-C per hexamer of DnaB at saturation. There was no evidence of cooperativity among the three sites. The data for DnaG were limited by the accessible range of concentrations, and there was evidence of some nonspecific interaction of primase with the chip surface (Fig. 2A). Nevertheless, the binding isotherm still fit reasonably to a 1:1 Langmuir model with KD = 2.8 ± 0.4 μm (Fig. 2C). Crystal Structure of DnaG-C—Previously, we reported crystallization of selenomethionine-substituted DnaG-C and data collection at a synchrotron source (30Loscha K. Oakley A.J. Bancia B. Schaeffer P.M. Prosselkov P. Otting G. Wilce M.C.J. Dixon N.E. Protein Expression Purif. 2004; 33: 304-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). The structure was solved at 2.8-Å resolution using phases derived from MAD data sets. Four selenium sites in the asymmetric unit were identified by Patterson search methods, using CNS (34Brünger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16944) Google Scholar). After refinement of their initial positions, the overall figure of merit was 0.57. This was improved to 0.75 by solvent flattening density modification. The map resulting from these phase data revealed electron density of a mainly helical protein. Interpretation of the electron density maps indicated that the four selenium sites corresponded to two buried selenomethionine residues in each of two DnaG-C monomers. A model consisting of 207 residues was built into these maps. The Rcryst (Rfree) of this model reduced from 49.9 (48.7%) to 38.3 (42.7%) after 10 cycles of refinement. This reduced to 27.5 (33.0%) after another cycle of manual model building and refinement. After three more cycles of model building and refinement, the final model had Rcryst = 26.8%, Rfree = 30.8%.

In our previous study, AVR4 was found to be the most stable biotin binding protein thus far characterized (Tm = 106.4 °C). In this study, we studied further the biotin-binding properties of AVR4. A decrease in the energy barrier between the biotin-bound and unbound state of AVR4 was observed when compared with that of avidin. The high resolution structure of AVR4 facilitated comparison of the structural details of avidin and AVR4. In the present study, we used the information obtained from these comparative studies to transfer the stability and functional properties of AVR4 to avidin. A chimeric avidin protein, ChiAVD, containing a 21-amino acid segment of AVR4 was found to be significantly more stable (Tm = 96.5 °C) than native avidin (Tm = 83.5 °C), and its biotin-binding properties resembled those of AVR4. Optimization of a crucial subunit interface of avidin by an AVR4-inspired point mutation, I117Y, significantly increased the thermostability of the avidin mutant (Tm = 97.5 °C) without compromising its high biotin-binding properties. By combining these two modifications, a hyperthermostable ChiAVD(I117Y) was constructed (Tm = 111.1 °C). This study provides an example of rational protein engineering in which another member of the protein family has been utilized as a source in the optimization of selected properties.

Avidin is a homotetrameric glycoprotein isolated from chicken egg white. Each eight-stranded β-barrel subunit of avidin consists of 128 amino acids and has one ligand-binding site. Avidin, like its bacterial analogue streptavidin from Streptomyces avidinii, is able to form a tight and specific complex with a water-soluble vitamin, d-biotin (Kd ≈ 10–15m) (1Green N.M. Adv. Protein Chem. 1975; 29: 85-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (1594) Google Scholar, 2Green N.M. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 184: 51-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (970) Google Scholar). This special property of avidin together with its tetrameric nature and high stability have made it one of the most widely exploited protein tools in the life sciences across a range of biochemical, pharmaceutical, and biophysical applications (3Wilchek M. Bayer E.A. Biomol. Eng. 1999; 16: 1-4Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 4Wilchek M. Bayer E. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 184: 5-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar).The avidin gene family consists of avidin and seven avidin-related genes (AVRs) (5Ahlroth M.K. Kola E.H. Ewald D. Masabanda J. Sazanov A. Fries R. Kulomaa M.S. Anim. Genet. 2000; 31: 367-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Although avidin protein is expressed in various tissues (6Tuohimaa P. Joensuu T. Isola J. Keinanen R. Kunnas T. Niemela A. Pekki A. Wallen M. Ylikomi T. Kulomaa M. Int. J. Dev. Biol. 1989; 33: 125-134PubMed Google Scholar), the other members of the gene family so far have not been found in the form of proteins in the chicken. However, mRNA molecules of some AVRs are detected because of inflammatory reaction (7Kunnas T.A. Wallen M.J. Kulomaa M.S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1216: 441-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). To study their functional and structural properties, AVR proteins were recently produced by a baculovirus insect cell expression system (8Laitinen O.H. Hytönen V.P. Ahlroth M.K. Pentikäinen O.T. Gallagher C. Nordlund H.R. Ovod V. Marttila A.T. Porkka E. Heino S. Johnson M.S. Airenne K.J. Kulomaa M.S. Biochem. J. 2002; 363: 609-617Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Avidin and AVR4 1The abbreviations used are: AVR4, Avidin-related protein encoded by genes AVR4/5 bearing mutation C122S; DSC, differential scanning calorimeter.1The abbreviations used are: AVR4, Avidin-related protein encoded by genes AVR4/5 bearing mutation C122S; DSC, differential scanning calorimeter. are ∼80% identical in amino acid sequence, and almost all of the residues involved in biotin binding in avidin are conserved in AVR4. It was found that recombinant AVR4 bound biotin almost as tightly (Kd ≈ 3.6 × 10–14m) as avidin (Kd ≈ 1.1 × 10–16m). However, it was shown to be significantly more thermostable (Tm = 106.4 °C) than avidin (Tm = 83.5 °C) (9Hytönen V.P. Nyholm T.K. Pentikainen O.T. Vaarno J. Porkka E.J. Nordlund H.R. Johnson M.S.

Chem. 2004; 279: 9337-9343Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar).It has been proposed that protein oligomerization in nature serves to obtain more stable structures (10Backmann J.

Van Beeumen J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2801-2806Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). In addition, stable proteins tend to have only a few intrinsic water clefts in their structures (12Knapp S. de Vos W.M. Rice D. Ladenstein R. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 267: 916-932Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 13Britton K.L. Yip K.S. Sedelnikova S.E. Stillman T.J. Adams M.W. Ma K. Maeder D.L. Robb F.T. Tolliday N. Vetriani C. Rice D.W. Baker P.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 293: 1121-1132Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Moreover, the role of ionic bonds in establishing the high thermal stability of proteins has been studied by Szilágyi and Závodszky (14Szilágyi A. Závodszky P. Structure Fold Des. 2000; 8: 493-504Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (557) Google Scholar), who performed a statistical analysis of high quality protein structures obtained from mesophilic and thermophilic organisms. They observed a correlation between the number of ion pairs and growth temperature of the organism and hypothesized that ion pairs have structural importance especially at high temperatures. The ionic bonds found in thermostable proteins have successfully been transferred to their analogues from mesophilic organisms to stabilize them (15Vetriani C. Maeder D.L. Tolliday N. Yip K.S.-P.

The importance of aromatic pairs in thermostable proteins has also been noticed (16Kannan N. Vishveshwara S. Protein Eng. 2000; 13: 753-761Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar), and these pairs have successfully been transferred between proteins to improve the thermal stability (17Serrano L. Bycroft M. Fersht A.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 218: 465-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar).In this study, we compared the structures of avidin and AVR4. Our aim was to determine the importance of the differences in the primary and three-dimensional structures 2Eisenberg-Domovich, Y., Hytönen, V. P., Wilchek, M., Bayer, E. A., Kulomaa, M.

On the basis of the results, we first engineered a chimeric avidin, in which β-strand 4 and its adjacent loops were replaced by the corresponding region from AVR4. In another mutant, a point mutation (I117Y) was introduced into avidin from the AVR4 sequence. Furthermore, we combined this mutation to the chimeric avidin also. The analysis of these new forms of avidin yields novel knowledge about the avidin protein family and in general provides an insight into how to improve the stability of proteins by combining characteristics from their known analogues.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMutagenesis of Avidin and the Purification of Expressed Recombinant Proteins—AVR4/5(C122S) was previously found to have properties similar with the wild type protein but lacking the tendency to form higher order oligomers (9Hytönen V.P.

In this article, term AVR4 denotes the C122S mutant of identical proteins coded by the genes AVR4 and AVR5.Site-directed mutagenesis of avidin encoding cDNA was performed by using the QuikChange (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) method of mutagenesis. DNA encoding chimeric ChiAVD protein was produced by three sequential PCR reactions in which the final product was obtained from partially overlapping megaprimer (18Sarkar G. Sommer S.S. BioTechniques. 1990; 8: 404-407PubMed Google Scholar) products. The final product was then cloned to the pFASTBAC1 vector. Recombinant baculoviruses coding for ChiAVD forms, AVR4 and AVD(I117Y), were generated as instructed by the manufacturer of the Bac-To-Bac™ system (Invitrogen). Proteins were produced in baculovirus-infected Sf9 insect cells in biotin-free medium as reported earlier (8Laitinen O.H. Hytönen V.P. Ahlroth M.K. Pentikäinen O.T. Gallagher C. Nordlund H.R.

A protein sample (4 μg) was incubated in the presence of proteinase K (1:25, w/w) at 37 °C for a predetermined time period, denatured by boiling in sample buffer (SDS, 2-mercaptoethanol), and subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by Coomassie Blue staining.Gel Filtration Analysis—The oligomeric state of the proteins was assayed with fast protein liquid chromatography gel filtration as described previously (9Hytönen V.P.

The signal measured for 3600 s (25 °C) or 2400 s (50 °C) after the addition of a 100-fold amount of unlabeled biotin (5 μm) was used to determine the dissociation rate constant.Differential Scanning Calorimetry—The transition midpoint of the heat denaturation (Tm) of the avidin proteins was studied using a Calorimetry Sciences Corporation Nano II DSC as in previous reports (23Gonzalez M.

Furthermore, we mutated isoleucine 117 in avidin to tyrosine according to AVR4 (Fig. 1). The mutagenesis work was first planned using information obtained from the primary sequence analysis, known three-dimensional structure of avidin, and homology modeling. During the work, the determination of the structure of AVR42 confirmed the selected rationale. The mutated avidins were produced using a baculovirus expression system (8Laitinen O.H. Hytönen V.P.

Avidin proteins were purified effectively by 2-iminobiotin-agarose affinity chromatography. Isolated proteins showed high purity in SDS-PAGE analysis (Fig. 2).

When these modifications were combined, the resultant ChiAVD(I117Y) was found to be even more stable than AVR4. In all cases holoforms were clearly more stable than apoforms. We observed a significant increase in the unfolding enthalpy with an increasing melting temperature. AVR4-b showed similar behavior as compared with the protein produced in insect cells in the DSC analysis, but the determined ΔH of the unfolding was significantly lower, possibly reflecting the role of glycosylation moieties in the unfolding process (37Wang C.

Avidin showed a lower dissociation rate when compared with AVR4. ChiAVD showed characteristics similar to AVR4 in this assay, i.e. faster dissociation at 50 °C.

Models of the structure of α<sub>1</sub>·β<sub>1</sub>, based on the x-ray crystal structure of adenylyl cyclase (AC) suggest the existence of a nucleotide-like binding site, in addition to the putative catalytic site.

The wild-type form of α<sub>1</sub>·β<sub>1</sub> (GC-wt) and the mutant form (AC-mut, α<sub>1</sub>R592Q·β<sub>1</sub>E473K,C541D) were purified, and their sensitivities to various nucleotides were assessed. In using the AC-mut as well as other mutants that coordinate purine binding, we were able to distinguish allosteric inhibitory effects of guanine nucleotides from competitively inhibitory effects on catalytic activity. Here we report that several nucleotide analogs drastically alter sGC and AC-mut activity by acting at a second nucleotide site, likely pseudosymmetric to the catalytic site. In particular, Mg<sup>2+</sup>GTPγS and Mg<sup>2+</sup>ATPγS inhibited cyclase activity through a mixed, non-competitive mechanism that was only observable under NO stimulation and not under basal conditions. The non-competitive pattern of inhibition was not present in mutants carrying the substitution β<sub>1</sub>D477A, the pseudosymmetric equivalent to α<sub>1</sub>D529 (located in the substrate-binding site and involved in substrate binding and catalysis), or with the double mutations α<sub>1</sub>E525K,C594D, the pseudosymmetric equivalent to β<sub>1</sub>E473K,C541D. Taken together these data suggest that occupation of the second site by nucleotides may underlie part of the mechanism of desensitization of sGC."

KGDHC consists of multiple copies of E1k, E2k, and E3. E1k and E2k are unique to KGDHC and may have functions independent of the complex. The present study tested the consequences of different levels of diminished E2k mRNA on protein levels of the subunits, KGDHC activity, and physiological responses. Human embryonic kidney cells were stably transfected with an E2k sense or antisense expression vector. Sense control (E2k-mRNA-100) was compared with two clones in which the mRNA was reduced to 67% of control (E2k-mRNA-67) or to 30% of control (E2k-mRNA-30). The levels of the E2k protein in clones paralleled the reduction in mRNA, and E3 proteins were unaltered. Unexpectedly, the clone with the greatest reduction in E2k protein (E2k-mRNA-30) had a 40% increase in E1k protein. The activity of the complex was only 52% of normal in E2k-mRNA-67 clone, but was near normal (90%) in E2k-mRNA-30 clone. Subsequent experiments tested whether the physiological consequences of a reduction in E2k mRNA correlated more closely to E2k protein or to KGDHC activity. Growth rate, increased DCF-detectable reactive oxygen species, and cell death in response to added oxidant were proportional to E2k proteins, but not complex activity. These results were not predicted because subunits unique to KGDHC have never been manipulated in mammalian cells.

Sci. 1999; 893: 79-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). These results suggest that the change in KGDHC activity is not merely a secondary event of neurodegeneration (14Mastrogiacomo F.

The current experiments test the consequences of a reduction of one component of KGDHC. KGDHC is a key and arguably rate-controlling enzyme of the tricarboxylic acid cycle. KGDHC consists of three subunits: α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase (E1k, EC 1.2.4.2), dihydrolipoyl succinyltransferase (E2k, EC 2.3.1.61), and dihydrolipoyl dehydrogenase (E3, EC 1.8.1.4). E1k and E2k are unique to KGDHC whereas E3 is also a component of the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDHC) and branched-chain α-ketoacid dehydrogenase complex (BCDHC). Structural studies of the Escherichia coli KGDHC demonstrate that 6 dimers of E1k and 6 dimers of E3 are arranged along an octahedral E2k core, which contains 24 polypeptide chains and only half of these chains have covalently bound lipoic acid (16Pettit F.H. Hamilton L. Munk P. Namihira G. Eley M.H. Willms C.R. Reed L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1973; 248: 5282-5290Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although the interactions of these subunits have been studied extensively in yeast and bacteria, previous studies have not been performed in mammalian cells. Oxidative stress is one plausible link between KGDHC deficiency and neurodegeneration. Accumulating evidence indicates that oxidative stress occurs in brains of patients with AD (17Markesbery W.R.

Neurol. 2003; 53 (discussion S36–S38): S26-S36Crossref PubMed Scopus (1726) Google Scholar). Oxidative stress can also lead to cell death (24Bowling A.C. Beal M.F. Life Sci. 1995; 56: 1151-1171Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). For example, exposure of Hela or CHO cells to 80% O2 for 2 days inhibits cell growth and leads to loss of reproductive capacity (25Schoonen W.G. Wanamarta A.H. van der Klei-van Moorsel J.M. Jakobs C. Joenje H. Mutat. Res. 1990; 237: 173-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 26Schoonen W.G. Wanamarta A.H. van der Klei-van Moorsel J.M. Jakobs C. Joenje H. J. Biol.

H2O2 also reduces KGDHC activity in intact cardiac mitochondria (27Nulton-Persson A.C. Szweda L.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 23357-23361Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar), synaptosomes (28Chinopoulos C. Tretter L. Adam-Vizi V. J.

However, the mechanisms that link diminished KGDHC, oxidative stress, and cell death are unclear. Each of the KGDHC subunits has unique enzymatic functions. Their response to H2O2 and roles in cell death may also differ. Whether the protein levels (i.e. immunoreactivity) of the three subunits of KGDHC decline with disease is variable in both genetic and sporadic forms of the AD (15Gibson G.E. Zhang H. Sheu K.F. Bogdanovich N. Lindsay J.G. Lannfelt L. Vestling M. Cowburn R.F. Ann. Neurol. 1998; 44: 676-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 31Mastrogiacoma F. Lindsay J.G. Bettendorff L. Rice J. Kish S.J. Ann. Neurol. 1996; 39: 592-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). The three subunits also show a selective response to oxidative stress (32Park L.C. Zhang H. Sheu K.F. Calingasan N.Y. Kristal B.S. Lindsay J.G. Gibson G.E. J. Neurochem. 1999; 72: 1948-1958Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Thus, to understand the response of KGDHC to disease and to oxidative stress, it is essential to investigate the roles of each subunit in normal biological function and in the cellular response to oxidative stress. The results will help us to elucidate the mechanism of the diminished KGDHC activity in neurodegenerative diseases. E2k, as a component of KGDH complex core, plays an essential role in mediating E1k-catalyzed decarboxylation of α-ketoglutarate and reductive acylation of the lipoyl moiety and E3-catalyzed reoxidation of the dihydrolipoyl moiety (33Reed L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38329-38336Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). For example, radicals generated by E2k can inhibit E1k (34Bunik V.I. Sievers C. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 5004-5015Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). The interaction of KGDHC with the reactive oxygen species (ROS)-dependent pathways provides for novel function(s) of the complex. For instance, in mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), the KGDHC-bound dihydrolipoate intermediate, a thioredoxin-like protein and a thioredoxin-dependent peroxidase comprise the specific antioxidant defense system (35Bryk R. Lima C.D. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Nathan C. Science. 2002; 295: 1073-1077Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). Thus, E2k was genetically manipulated to different levels in human embryonic kidney cells (HEK293) using an antisense RNA strategy. The consequences of reducing E2k mRNA by about one-third and two-thirds on cellular function under normal conditions and following oxidative stress were analyzed. Cell Culture—The parental cell line of Flp-In-293 was a human embryonic kidney cell line (HEK293). Flp-In-293 cells (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) (high glucose) supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum, penicillin (50 units/ml), streptomycin (50 μg/ml), and zeocin (100 μg/ml), and incubated at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 in air. Flp-In-293 cell lines expressing sense or antisense RNA of E2k were grown in the same medium without zeocin although with the addition of hygromycin (100 μg/ml). Cloning and Construction of E2k Sense and Antisense Expression Vectors—An antisense RNA strategy was used to manipulate the expression of E2k. BLAST searching was performed to ensure no homologies between the designed E2k antisense DNA and other off-target genes. In brief, Flp-In-293 cells were grown in a 6-well plate. Total RNA was isolated using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) according to the supplier's instructions. This was followed by first strand cDNA synthesis using the First Strand cDNA synthesis kit for RT-PCR (AMV) (Roche Applied Science, Indianapolis, IN) with oligo-p(dT)15 as primer. The desired insert of E2k was amplified from the synthesized cDNA with TaqDNA polymerase using a pair of gene-specific primers (PE2kS 5′-AGGTGGGAGAAAGCTGTTGGAG-3′/PE2kAS 5′-TCCCGATGTTCTGAACGCAGAC-3′). PCR was performed under the following conditions: 4 min of predenaturation at 94 °C, 35 cycles of denaturation for 30 s at 94 °C, annealing for 30 s at 60 °C, and extension for 30 s at 72 °C, extra extension for 10 min at 72 °C. After visualization on a 1.5% of agarose gel, RT-PCR product was TA-cloned into an expression vector, pcDNA5/FRT/TO-TOPO (Invitrogen) followed by transformation into E. coli competent cells-TOP10 (Invitrogen). Plasmids isolated from randomly picked clones were subjected to restriction enzyme digestion to verify the presence and orientation of the inserts. PmeI was used to verify the presence of inserts. Orientation of inserts was checked by KpnI single digestion. Clones with the inserts in sense and antisense orientation were selected based on the size of digestion product and subjected to DNA sequence confirmation. Generation of Stable E2k Sense/Antisense RNA-expressing Cell Lines—The Flp-In-293 cell line contains a single Flp recombinase target site (FRT) in a transcriptionally active genomic locus. This facilitates a homologous recombination event between FRT sites upon cotransfection with an expression vector pcDNA5/FRT/GOI (gene of interest) and pOG44 (Flp recombinase expression vector). Expression vectors containing sequence confirmed-sense and antisense DNA of E2k were CsCl gradient-purified (Lofstrand, Gaithersburg, MD). Transfection was performed using FuGENE 6 transfection reagent (Roche Applied Science) according to the supplier's instruction. In brief, about 1 μg of expression vector and 9 μg of pOG44 were cotransfected into Flp-In-293 cells (in 5 ml of DMEM) using 18 μl of FuGENE 6 transfection reagent. After incubation of cells at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 in air for 6 h, an extra 5 ml of 2× DMEM complete medium (fetal bovine serum, 20% (v/v), penicillin (100 units/ml), streptomycin (100 μg/ml)) was added. Medium was replaced with 10 ml of 1× DMEM complete medium at 24-h post-transfection. At 48-h post-transfection, cells were split into fresh 1× DMEM complete medium such that they were no more than 25% confluent. After 2–3 h of incubation, selection was started by replacing the medium with 1× DMEM complete medium containing hygromycin (100 μg/ml). The medium was changed regularly with fresh 1× DMEM complete medium containing hygromycin until foci appeared. In about 3 weeks, foci were picked using cloning cylinders, expanded, and screened for sense and antisense RNA expression of E2k by RT-PCR. Total RNA was isolated from transfected cells and subjected to first strand cDNA synthesis. PCR was performed with TaqDNA polymerase using CMV forward primer (5′-CGCAAATGGGCGGTAGGCGTG-3′) paired with one gene-specific primer to verify the expression of sense (PE2kAS) and antisense RNA (PE2kS) of E2k. The PCR condition was as follows: 4 min of predenaturation at 94 °C, 30 cycles of denaturation for 30 s at 95 °C, annealing for 30 s at 65 °C and extension for 30 s at 72 °C. Semiquantitative RT-PCR was performed to estimate the effect of the expression of antisense RNA on mRNA level of E2k. PCRs were performed with a series dilution of cDNA templates to ensure the amplification is within linear range. β-Actin forward primer 5′-TGCGCAGAAAACAAGATGAGATT-3′ and reverse primer 5′-TGGGGGACAAAAAGGGGGAAGG-3′ were used to amplify β-actin as an internal control. E2k forward primer 5′-ATGCTGTCCCGATCCCGCTGTGTGTCTCGG-3′ and E2k reverse primer 5′-CTAAAGATCCAGGAGGAGGACTCTGGGATC-3′ were used for E2k amplification. Conditions used for PCR were as follow: 4 min of predenaturation at 94 °C, 25 cycles (for β-actin) or 35 cycles (for E2k) of denaturation for 30 s at 94 °C, annealing for 30 s at 55 °C and extension for 30 s (β-actin) or 1.5 min (E2k) at 72 °C, extra extension for 10 min at 72 °C. PCR products were run on a 0.9% (E2k) or a 1.2% (β-actin) agarose gel and stained with ethidium bromide. PCR products within linear range were subjected to quantitative densitometry analysis using Quantity One software (Bio-Rad). SDS-PAGE and Western Blotting—Cells expressing sense or antisense RNA of E2k in 100-mm cell culture dishes (near confluent) were washed twice with Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline (D-PBS) and homogenized in ice-cold cell lysate buffer containing Tris-HCl (50 mm, pH 7.2), dithiothreitol (1 mm), EGTA (0.2 mm), Triton X-100 (0.4%), and the protease inhibitor leupeptin (50 μm). Protein concentrations of the lysates were determined by a Bio-Rad protein assay based on the Bradford dye-binding method (Bio-Rad) using bovine serum albumin as standard. About 10 μg of total protein was mixed with SDS loading buffer and denatured further at 100 °C. Electrophoresis was done with a 10% Novex Tris-glycine gel (Invitrogen) using 120 volts for about 2.5 h. Separated proteins were then electrotransferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (Amersham Biosciences) using 45 volts for about 3 h. Blots were blocked with Tris-buffered saline (TBS), 0.1% Tween-20, 3% bovine serum albumin (for E1k/E2k/E3 detection), or TBS, 0.1% Tween-20, 5% nonfat milk (for actin detection) at 4 °C overnight, and incubated with rabbit E1k, E2k, or E3 antibody (1:1,000 dilution for E1k antibody; 1:10,000 for E2k and E3 antibodies) at 4 °C overnight (E1k and E2k antibodies were generated in collaboration with Rockland Immunochemicals Inc., Gilbertsville, PA; E3 antibody was a generous gift from Gordon Lindsay). Duplicate membranes were incubated with goat actin polyclonal antibody (1:500, Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc.) at 4 °C overnight. After washing thoroughly with TBS, 0.1% Tween-20 at room temperature, the blots were incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (H+L) (1:5,000; Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratory, Inc.; West Grove, PA) at room temperature for 1 h for E1k/E2k/E3 detection, or donkey anti-goat IgG-HRP (1:1,000; Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc.) for actin detection. After extensive washing, the bands were visualized by the enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) system (Amersham Biosciences) and analyzed by densitometry. KGDHC Activity Assays—Two independent, well established assays were used to measure KGDHC activities. KGDHC catalyzes the following reaction: α-ketoglutarate + NAD+ + CoA → succinyl CoA + CO2 + NADH. Both methods use the specific substrate α-ketoglutarate (α-KG) to distinguish NADH production from KGDHC to that from other enzymes (i.e. substrate specificity). One method assays activity in cell lysates whereas the other assesses the activity in slightly permeabilized cells in which the mitochondria are nearly intact (an in situ assay). KGDHC activities in cell lysates were determined by conventional α-KG-dependent NADH generation. Cells (∼80% confluence) in a 6-well plate were washed twice with D-PBS, and lysed with 250 μl of cell lysate buffer (see above). KGDHC activities (KG-dependent production of NADH) were assayed immediately as described previously (1Gibson G.E. Sheu K.F. Blass J.P. Baker A. Carlson K.C. Harding B. Perrino P. Arch. Neurol. 1988; 45: 836-840Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar). Values were corrected for the presence of NADH oxidase. KGDHC activities were also determined with an in situ histochemistry assay (36Park L.C. Calingasan N.Y. Sheu K.F. Gibson G.E. Anal. Biochem. 2000; 277: 86-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) with some modifications. The basis of the in situ assay is very similar to the lysis method except that the reducing equivalents are coupled to nitroblue tetrazolium. The specificity again depends upon the substrates. In brief, cells (3 × 104 cells/well) were seeded in a poly-d-lysine-coated 24-well plate (25 μg/ml of poly-d-lysine). When nearly confluent, cells were washed twice with Hank's balanced salt solution (HBSS) (Invitrogen) and once with HBSS containing 0.05% Triton X-100. About 200 μl of assay mixture (50 mm Tris-HCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm CaCl2, 50 μm EDTA, 0.2% Triton X-100, 0.3 mm TPP, 5 μg/ml rotenone, 35 mg/ml polyvinylalcohol, 3 mm β-NAD, 0.75 mm CoA, 3 mm α-KG, 0.75 mm nitroblue tetrazolium (NBT), and 0.05 mm phenazine methosulfate) was transferred to cells. An assay mix without CoA and α-KG was used for the blank. After 30 min of incubation at 37 °C, the reaction was stopped by washing the cells twice with HBSS. The dark blue formazan was solubilized with 250 μl of 10% SDS in 0.01 n HCl overnight, and OD570 was read using a SPECTRA MAX 250 microplate reader (Molecular Devices). The OD570 was normalized with protein contents determined using a BCA™ protein assay kit (Pierce). Growth Rate—Cells (3×103) were seeded in 96-well plates, and growth was monitored. Cells were fixed after 4 h, 3 and 5 days growth by adding 50 μl of 50% trichloroacetic acid and incubating at 4 °C for 1 h. Fixed cells were then rinsed twice with double-distilled water. Once the plate was air-dried, cells were stained with 100 μl of 0.4% sulforhodamine B solution (Sigma-Aldrich) for 30 min to measure the total protein. Then, the wells were rinsed twice with 1% acetic acid. After the plate was air-dried, 200 μl of 10 mm Tris was added to solubilize the incorporated dye, and OD570 was measured in a SPECTRA MAX 250 microplate reader (Molecular Devices). The background was measured in wells incubated with growth medium without cells. Live/Dead Viability Assay—Cells were allowed to grow until they were nearly confluent. Cells were detached with cell dissociation solution (Sigma-Aldrich) and seeded into a 96-well plate at a density of 6 × 104 cells/100 μl per well. After incubation in a 37 °C, 5% CO2 incubator for 2 h, 100 μl of live/dead viability working reagents containing 2 μm calcein AM and 4 μm ethidium homodimer-1 (EthD-1) (Molecular Probes Inc.) were added to the wells. After a further 30 min of incubation in the 37 °C, 5% CO2 incubator, calcein AM/EthD-1-stained cells were analyzed using a SPECTRA MAX GEMINI XS fluorescence microplate reader in a well scan mode (fill pattern) with the following settings: Ex525/Em620, 590-nm cutoff for dead cells; Ex485/Em525, 515-nm cutoff for live cells. The relative percentage of dead cells was presented as relative fluorescence units (RFU) obtained from dead cells divided by RFU obtained from both live and dead cells. The effects of H2O2 on cell viability were also determined. Cells were dissociated, seeded into two 96-well plates (6×104 cells/100 μl/well) as described above and allowed to incubate in a 37 °C, 5% CO2 incubator for 2 h. After a 0.5- or 23.5-h incubation with 100 μm H2O2, an additional 10 μl of 1.1 mm H2O2 and 100 μl of live/dead viability working reagents were added to the wells. Cells were incubated for another half hour. Fluorescent signals were obtained, and the relative percentage of dead cells was calculated as described in the previous paragraph. DCF-detectable ROS in Response to External Oxidant—Cells grown in 100-mm culture dishes (near confluent) were trypsinized and seeded into a d-polylysine (25 μg/ml)-coated 96-well plates at 3 × 103 cells/well. After 5 days in culture, cells were washed once with 100 μl of balanced salt solution (BSS) (140 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm glucose, 10 mm HEPES, and 2.5 mm CaCl2, pH 7.4), then loaded with 100 μl of 10 μm 6-carboxy-2′,7′-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate, di(acetoxymethyl ester) (6-c-H2DCF-AM) (Molecular Probes Inc.) in BSS buffer. After 1 h at 37 °C, cells were rinsed once with 100 μl of Ca-free BSS buffer and treated with 44 and 88 μm H2O2 in Ca-free BSS buffer, the plate was read at 1, 5, 10, 15, 30, and 60 min at an excitation wavelength of 485 nm and emission wavelength of 538 nm (cutoff 590 mm) using the SPECTRAmax GEMINI XS fluorescence microplate reader. Basal DCF-detectable ROS was obtained with cells incubated with BSS buffer only. Generation and Characterization of the Stable Cell Lines— E2k sense and antisense DNA in the expression vectors were confirmed by automatic DNA sequencing before the CsCl purification. The Flp-In-293 cell line was co-transfected with the expression vector and pOG44 as described under “Experimental Procedures.” To determine the role of an enzyme, particularly one that is part of an enzyme complex, a single clone or multiple clones with the same activities may give a misleading conclusion. Thus, at least 15 clones were screened for the effects of expression of E2k antisense RNA on mRNA and protein of E2k. Both mRNA and protein contents of E2k showed various levels of reduction in these clones. Cells with different levels of E2k protein are required to better understand the roles of E2k in the overall KGDHC activity and the responses to oxidative stress. We intentionally selected two clones to study in detail, one that had a reduction in E2k mRNA levels of about one-third and one with a reduction of about two-thirds. Different levels of reductions in mRNA are most likely because of the amount of antisense RNA expressed. However, there are still many other factors that may play important roles in determining the effectiveness of a particular antisense RNA, such as the half-life of the antisense RNA in vivo, and the turnover time of the target mRNA. The expressions of an E2k antisense RNA in the chosen clones are shown in Fig. 1. The levels of E2k mRNA in these two clones were reduced to about 67% (E2k-mRNA-67) and 30% (E2k-mRNA-30) of the cells transfected with an E2k sense construct (E2k-mRNA-100) after normalization with β-actin (Fig. 2). Values in Fig. 2B represent mean relative densities from two independent experiments.Fig. 2E2k mRNA levels were diminished in E2k antisense RNA-expressing cells as evaluated by semiquantitative RT-PCR.

https://openalex.org/W1975539780,"Studies of the molybdenum-containing dimethyl sulfoxide reductase from Rhodobacter sphaeroides have yielded new insight into its catalytic mechanism. A series of reductive titrations, performed over the pH range 6–10, reveal that the absorption spectrum of reduced enzyme is highly sensitive to pH. The reaction of reduced enzyme with dimethyl sulfoxide is found to be clearly biphasic throughout the pH range 6–8 with a fast, initial substrate-binding phase and substrate-concentration independent catalytic phase. The intermediate formed at the completion of the fast phase has the characteristic absorption spectrum of the established dimethyl sulfoxide-bound species. Quantitative reductive and oxidative titrations of the enzyme demonstrate that the molybdenum center takes up only two reducing equivalents, implying that the two pyranopterin equivalents of the molybdenum center are not formally redox active. Finally, the visible spectrum associated with the catalytically relevant “high-g split” Mo(V) species has been determined. Spectral deconvolution and EPR quantitation of enzyme-monitored turnover experiments with trimethylamine N-oxide as substrate reveal that no substrate-bound intermediate accumulates and that Mo(V) content remains near unity for the duration of the reaction. Similar experiments with dimethyl sulfoxide show that significant quantities of both the Mo(V) species and the dimethyl sulfoxide-bound complex accumulate during the course of reaction. Accumulation of the substrate-bound complex in the steady-state with dimethyl sulfoxide arises from partial reversal of the physiological reaction in which the accumulating product, dimethyl sulfide, reacts with oxidized enzyme to yield the substrate-bound intermediate, a process that significantly slows turnover.

Dimethyl sulfoxide reductase is a bacterial enzyme responsible for the reduction of dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO) 11 The abbreviations used are: Me2SO, dimethyl sulfoxide; Me2SOR, dimethyl sulfoxide reductase; Rc, Rhodobacter capsulatus; CAPS, 3-(cyclohexylamino)-1-propanesulfonic acid; DMS, dimethylsulfide; PTA, phosphatriazaadamantane (1,3,5-triaza-7-phosphatricyclo[3.3.1.1]decane); MCA, multiple component analysis; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid; TMAO, trimethylamine N-oxide.11 The abbreviations used are: Me2SO, dimethyl sulfoxide; Me2SOR, dimethyl sulfoxide reductase; Rc, Rhodobacter capsulatus; CAPS, 3-(cyclohexylamino)-1-propanesulfonic acid; DMS, dimethylsulfide; PTA, phosphatriazaadamantane (1,3,5-triaza-7-phosphatricyclo[3.3.1.1]decane); MCA, multiple component analysis; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid; TMAO, trimethylamine N-oxide. to dimethyl sulfide (DMS). Substrate arises via breakdown of dimethylsulfoniopropionate, the principal osmolyte of marine algae, and is relatively abundant in the environment. The significance of the reaction rests in the important role of DMS in modulating global solar albedo (1Turner S.M. Nightingale P.D. Spokes L.J. Liddicoat M.I. Liss P.S. Nature. 1996; 383: 513-517Crossref Scopus (109) Google Scholar), DMS is one of several molecules that has been traced specifically in recent iron-seeding experiments in the equatorial Pacific Ocean (2Coale K.H. Johnson K.S. Fitzwater S.E. Gordon R.M. Tanner S. Chavez F.P. Feroli L. Sakamoto C. Rogers P. Millero F. Steinberg P. Nightingale P. Cooper D. Cochlan W.P. Landry M.R. Constantinou J. Rollwagen G. Trasvina A. Kudela R. Nature. 1996; 383: 495-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (1232) Google Scholar). In organisms such as Escherichia coli, Me2SO reductase is a membrane-bound terminal respiratory oxidase consisting of separate molybdenum- and iron-sulfur-containing subunits, as well as a membrane anchor. In organisms such as Rhodobacter sphaeroides and Rhodobacter capsulatus, on the other hand, the enzyme is a soluble periplasmic protein of 85 kDa possessing only a molybdenum center (3Schindelin H. Kisker C. Hilton J. Rajagopalan K.V. Rees D.C. Science. 1996; 272: 1615-1621Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar); it appears to be involved in dissipating excess reducing equivalents in the absence of oxygen and is maximally expressed when the organism is grown photoheterotrophically on a relatively reduced carbon source such as malate. Me2SO reductases from both sources are very similar, and members of the same family of mononuclear molybdenum enzymes, and share a common active site structure in which the metal is coordinated by 2 eq of a pyranopterin cofactor (common to all molybdenum enzymes other than nitrogenase, and also found in all tungsten-containing enzymes) via an enedithiolate linkage. The Rhodobacter enzyme catalyzes the reduction of Me2SO according to the following stoichiometry, using the pentaheme c-type cytochrome DorC (4Shaw A.L. Hochkoeppler A. Bonora P. Zannoni D. Hanson G.R. McEwan A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9911-9914Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) as the physiological source of reducing equivalents: Me2S = O + DorC2e– + 2H+ → Me2S + DorCox + H2O. Me2SO reductase has been the subject of a number of spectroscopic studies because of the distinctive absorption features of its molybdenum center and the absence of other redox-active chromophores (5Adams B.

Its structure has also been extensively examined by x-ray crystallography (3Schindelin H. Kisker C. Hilton J. Rajagopalan K.V. Rees D.C.

Although initially there was some controversy concerning the active site structure, the crystal structure of R. sphaeroides Me2SO reductase has recently been determined at 1.3-Å resolution (17Li H.K. Temple C. Rajagopalan K.V. Schindelin H. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2000; 122: 7673-7680Crossref Scopus (166) Google Scholar), where it is found that the oxidized enzyme is heterogeneous at the molybdenum center with two alternate conformations: a pentacoordinate dioxo monodithiolene formed when a molecule of HEPES buffer binds near the active site, as well as a hexacoordinate mono-oxo bisdithiolene ligand set (with the sixth ligand position occupied by Ser147 from the protein). This latter structure is thought to represent the catalytically functional form of the oxidized active site (18Bray R.C. Adams B. Smith A.T. Bennett B. Bailey S. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 11258-11269Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), whereas the former is known to form upon aerobic incubation of oxidized enzyme in HEPES-containing buffer (18Bray R.C. Adams B. Smith A.T. Bennett B. Bailey S. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 11258-11269Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Possessing the serinate, two oxygen, and one (bidentate) dithiolene ligand to the molybdenum center, this “HEPES-modified” enzyme unsurprisingly displays a visible spectrum analogous to that of oxidized Arabidopsis thaliana sulfite oxidase (SO); a mononuclear molybdenum enzyme with a similar pentacoordinate active site (20Eilers T. Schwarz G. Brinkmann H. Witt C. Richter T. Nieder J. Koch B. Hille R. Hansch R. Mendel R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 46989-46994Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Although Me2SO reductase from both R. sphaeroides and R. capsulatus has been extensively studied spectroscopically and crystallographically, much remains to be learned concerning its reaction mechanism. Utilizing UV-visible and EPR spectrometry, the present work seeks to elucidate more clearly the mechanism of Me2SO reductase activity for pre-steady-state turnover in the reductive and oxidative directions as well as enzyme behavior in the steady-state. A study of the oxidative half-reaction of reduced Me2SO reductase with Me2SO shows biphasic kinetics over the pH range 6–8, with a kinetically competent intermediate formed with an extremely fast, substrate concentration-dependent rate (extrapolated at infinite [Me2SO] to a value in excess of 1000 s–1); this intermediate subsequently breaks down in a substrate-concentration independent manner. The intermediate exhibits a spectrum dominated by two strong absorption bands at 470 and 550 nm and represents the Me2SO-bound, reduced form of the enzyme that has been characterized by resonance Raman spectroscopy (11Garton S.D. Hilton J. Hiroyuki O. Crouse B.R. Rajagopalan K.V. Johnson M.K. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1997; 119: 12906-12916Crossref Scopus (111) Google Scholar) and x-ray crystallography (14McAlpine A.S. McEwan A.G. Bailey S. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 275: 613-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Above pH 8 the kinetics of Ered·Me2SO decay become increasingly non-ideal, yet show that the rate of enzyme oxidation slows with an apparent pKa of 8.5, the pH-dependent behavior observed is similar to that determined for forward steady-state activity in both the R. capsulatus (5Adams B. Smith A.T. Bailey S. McEwan A.G. Bray R.C. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 8501-8511Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) and R. sphaeroides enzymes (7Bastian N.R. Kay C.J. Barber M.J. Rajagopalan K.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 45-51Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Additionally, we have determined that the visible spectrum of fully reduced enzyme is particularly sensitive to changes in pH as compared with the spectra for either oxidized or Me2SO-bound Me2SO reductase. As in the oxidative half-reaction, the pKa associated with the spectral changes observed for reduced enzyme were found to be in good agreement with that reported for steady-state activity (5Adams B. Smith A.T. Bailey S. McEwan A.G. Bray R.C. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 8501-8511Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 7Bastian N.R. Kay C.J. Barber M.J. Rajagopalan K.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 45-51Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In ensuring that neither pterin moiety is formally redox active, quantitative reductive titrations, performed with the water-soluble phosphine PTA, as well as DMS and sodium dithionite show that the enzyme is indeed a frank 2-electron system. Enzyme-monitored turnover experiments of the reductive half-reaction using sodium dithionite over the pH range 6–10 have revealed the visible spectrum of the 1-electron reduced enzyme. EPR spectrometry confirms that this catalytic intermediate represents the Mo(V) state giving rise to the so-called “high-g split” EPR signal (9Bennett B. Benson N. McEwan A.G. Bray R.C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 225: 321-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). The visible spectrum of this Mo(V) species displays negligible pH sensitivity and is characterized by two absorption bands at 550 and 675 nm, similar to the glycerol-inhibited Mo(V) form of the enzyme, generated by exposure of reduced Me2SO reductase to 50% (v/v) glycerol as described by Finnegan et al. (6Finnegan M.G. Hilton J. Rajagopalan K.V. Johnson M.K. Inorg. Chem. 1993; 32: 2616-2617Crossref Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Finally, spectral deconvolution via multiple component analysis (MCA) of enzyme-monitored turnover experiments (in which the absorption spectrum of enzyme is followed in the course of steady-state turnover with substrate) reveal no accumulation of the substrate-bound intermediate in the course of steady-state turnover with trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO). However, significant accumulation of this intermediate is observed using Me2SO as substrate, increasing to ∼80% late in the course of the reaction. This behavior is the result of product-inhibition by DMS, which, unlike trimethylamine, is able to rebind the oxidized enzyme to yield the Ered·Me2SO complex. This behavior presumably reflects the thermodynamic stability of the Me2SO-bound, reduced form of the enzyme. R. sphaeroides was grown photoheterotrophically at 30 °C using Omerod's medium with malate as the principle carbon source and in the presence of ∼60 mm Me2SO. Bacteria were harvested in late log phase and stored until needed at –20 °C. Me2SO reductase was purified as follows, with all purification steps performed at 4 °C unless otherwise specified. Approximately 100 g (wet weight) of R. sphaeroides cells were thawed and washed three times with 20 mm Tris-HCl, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.6 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, containing 0.9% NaCl. The washed cells were then resuspended in 10 mm Tris-HCl, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.6 mm EDTA, pH 8.4, to which 100 mg of lysozyme was added and incubated for 2 h at room temperature. The cell suspension was next sonicated for three 2-min bursts on a Branson Sonifier 450. Spheroplasts and cell debris were pelleted by ultracentrifugation at 45,000 × g for 45 min. Conductivity of the supernatant was reduced to ∼3 mmho and pH was adjusted to 8.4 by overnight dialysis in the same buffer. This periplasmic extract was loaded on a 2.5 × 45-cm DEAE column and eluted with a linear gradient of 0 to 600 mm NaCl. Fractions containing Me2SO reductase were next brought to 20% (NH4)2SO4 and run on a phenyl-Sepharose column; enzyme was eluted with ∼5% (NH4)2SO4 and concentrated. Finally, Me2SO reductase was further purified by S-200 gel filtration. All reagents and buffers were of the highest quality commercially available and were used without purification. Prior to use, freshly isolated Me2SO reductase was subjected to “redox cycling” as previously described (18Bray R.C. Adams B. Smith A.T. Bennett B. Bailey S. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 11258-11269Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) to eliminate any structural heterogeneity at the active site and stored in liquid nitrogen until needed. Ultraviolet visible absorption spectra were obtained using a Hewlett-Packard 8452 diode-array spectrophotometer. Rapid reaction, pH jump, and steady-state experiments were performed using an Applied Photophysics Inc. SX.18MV stopped-flow apparatus. Enzyme-monitored turnover, reduction, and pH jump experiments were performed using a photo-diode array detector that allows detection of the full visible spectrum, with absorbance changes monitored using Applied Photophysics software. Transients observed in rapid reaction experiments were collected as transmittance voltages by a high-speed A/D converter and absorbance changes were obtained using Applied Photophysics software. Time courses thus obtained were fitted to sums of exponentials using an iterative nonlinear least-squares Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm. For rapid reaction studies, hyperbolic plots of observed rate constant versus substrate concentration dependence were fitted using the equation, kobs = kox[S]/(Kd + [S]) to obtain the limiting rate constant, kox, and the dissociation constant, Kd. The Arrhenius activation energy, EA, was determined from plots of ln(kobs) versus 1/T for data obtained over the temperature range 15–35 °C. The slope of the resulting line is equal to –EA/R (19Tinoco I. Sauer K. Wang J.C. Berova N. Nakanishi K. Woody R.W. Physical Chemistry, Principles and Applications in Biological Sciences. 2nd Ed. Wiley-VCH, New York1985: 275-356Google Scholar); ΔH‡ was calculated by the relation EA = ΔH‡ + RT. ΔS‡ was calculated using the relation: A = kBT/h exp (ΔS‡/R). Anaerobic solutions of oxidized Me2SO reductase were prepared by placing enzyme in a tonometer equipped with a side-arm cuvette and three-way stopcock fitted with a male Luer connector, followed by repeated evacuation and flushing with O2-free argon (passed over an oxygen-scrubbing BASF catalyst). The enzyme was then reduced by titrating with sodium dithionite, and monitoring the reaction spectrophotometrically. Steady-state reactions required quantitation of sodium dithionite, which was accomplished by calibration of concentrated dithionite stock solutions against dichloroindophenol. Loss of absorbance at 600 nm, because of dichloroindophenol reduction, was followed spectrophotometrically and the concentration of reducing equivalents thus calculated. The glycerol-inhibited enzyme was prepared as described by Finnegan et al. (6Finnegan M.G. Hilton J. Rajagopalan K.V. Johnson M.K. Inorg. Chem. 1993; 32: 2616-2617Crossref Scopus (68) Google Scholar) where dithionite-reduced enzyme in 50 mm Tris-HCl, 0.6 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, is incubated aerobically with 50% (v/v) glycerol. For pH jump experiments, enzyme was first equilibrated in either 10 mm MES, pH 6, or 10 mm CHES, pH 10. The solution was made anaerobic and reduced as described above and then mixed with 100 mm buffer of the opposing pH in a stopped-flow device at room temperature. The kinetics of enzyme reduction was carried out by mixing 100 μm Me2SO reductase with 0.5 or 25 mm concentrations of sodium dithionite in 50 mm phosphate, 0.6 mm EDTA, pH 6.0, at 5 °C. Again, reactions were monitored using a photo-diode array and rate constants from these studies were obtained by Applied Photophysics software using an iterative nonlinear least-squares Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm. For enzyme-monitored turnover experiments, 100 μm Me2SO reductase was mixed with a solution of substrate and dithionite in a stopped-flow apparatus. The basic solution for all reaction mixtures used (including that for the enzyme) was 50 mm KH2PO4, 0.6 mm EDTA, pH 6.0. The absorption changes seen in the course of the reaction were obtained and analyzed by multicomponent analysis using the Matlab software package (The Math Works Inc.) installed on an SGI computer. The Moore-Penrose pseudoinverse of a matrix of parent spectra (M) was calculated by the equation: C = (M′M)–1×M′. Relative contributions of parent spectra (P) are calculated by the equation: P = CA, where A represents a matrix of the experimental data (children spectra). Further manipulations were performed using SigmaPlot version 8.0. Because sodium dithionite (which absorbs strongly in the near UV) was used as the reductant, the analysis was restricted to wavelengths above 400 nm. Parallel steady-state reactions for quantitation of EPR intensity were performed in a cooled water bath (5 °C), with aliquots were removed at specific times and quickly frozen in a dry ice/acetone bath (about 2 s). EPR measurements were carried out on a Brüker ESP 300 spectrometer with the following instrument settings: modulation frequency of 100 kHz, modulation amplitude of 5 gauss, sweep width of 300 G (from 3250 to 3550 G), and 2 milliwatt of power. Quantitation of Mo(V) intensity was performed using a bovine xanthine oxidase-2-hydroxy-6-methylpurine standard. Finally, simulations of these reactions were performed using Applied Photophysics software. pH Dependence of the Absorption Spectrum of Me2SO Reductase—Prior to examining the pre-steady-state pH dependence of the kinetics of Me2SO reductase oxidation by Me2SO, reductive titrations at differing pH values were performed to determine any pH dependence on the visible spectra associated with the three primary intermediates of the enzyme. Fig. 1 shows absorbance spectra of oxidized, substrate-bound, and reduced Me2SO reductase at pH 6, 8, and 10. The absorption spectrum of oxidized Me2SO reductase is essentially insensitive to pH (Fig. 1A), displaying only a slight increase in absorbance near the feature observed at 350 nm in going from pH 6 to 10. By contrast, the spectrum of reduced enzyme exhibits a pronounced loss of absorption features as the pH is increased, with clear maxima at 375 and 650 nm seen at pH 6.0 progressively lost until a final, quite different spectrum is observed at pH 10 (Fig. 1C). This pH-induced spectral change observed for the reduced Me2SO reductase is fully reversed upon equilibration of enzyme in pH 6.0 buffer. The kinetics of the pH-dependent spectral change seen with reduced Me2SO was followed in experiments in which enzyme in dilute buffer at one extreme in pH was mixed with more concentrated buffer at the other extreme. In the Supplemental Materials, Fig. S1 shows representative traces seen upon changing the pH, following the reaction at 375 nm; rate constants for the low-to-high and high-to-low pH experiments were determined to be 2.10 and 14.9 s–1, respectively. Additionally, the absorption spectrum for the Ered·Me2SO complex (generated by treatment of oxidized enzyme with DMS) is found to be pH-dependent, although the absorption changes observed upon equilibration in higher pH buffer are more subtle than those observed in the reduced enzyme. The overall spectral line shape of the substrate-bound species is maintained, with modest bleaching observed centered at 550 nm and a slight increase in long wavelength absorbance above 600 nm as pH is raised (Fig. 1B). The pKa values associated with the spectral changes observed for the reduced and Ered·Me2SO intermediates are ∼9.5 and 8.5, respectively. The high pH spectrum of reduced Me2SO reductase exhibits a shoulder at 450 nm and qualitatively resembles a red-shifted version of the spectrum of reduced A. thaliana sulfite oxidase as reported by Eilers et al. (20Eilers T. Schwarz G. Brinkmann H. Witt C. Richter T. Nieder J. Koch B. Hille R. Hansch R. Mendel R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 46989-46994Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the visible spectrum exhibited by HEPES-modified (Me2SORmodH) enzyme has been previously observed to resemble that for the C207S mutant of the rat sulfite oxidase molybdenum domain (18Bray R.C. Adams B. Smith A.T. Bennett B. Bailey S. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 11258-11269Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Both of these enzyme forms have been shown crystallographically to possess a core dioxomolybdenum unit coordinated to a single equivalent of the pyranopterin cofactor of the molybdenum center in addition to the protein ligand; in both cases, it is the pterin designated in the crystal structure as “Q” (rather than “P”) that has dissociated from the metal. The pH-induced spectral change associated with the reduced enzyme is concomitant with the observed loss of activity in steady-state assays (5Adams B. Smith A.T. Bailey S. McEwan A.G. Bray R.C. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 8501-8511Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 7Bastian N.R. Kay C.J. Barber M.J. Rajagopalan K.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 45-51Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and we conclude that both phenomena are attributable to the reversible dissociation of the Q pterin from the molybdenum, being replaced by a molybdenum = O group. That only reduced Me2SOR displays a pronounced pH dependence in all likelihood reflects the importance of the catalytically labile oxo group of the molybdenum center (which is lost upon reduction) in maintaining coordination of the Q pterin at high pH. Several previous crystallographic and spectroscopic studies of the reduced Me2SO reductase provide precedence for dissociation of the Q pterin. The crystal structure determined for reduced enzyme (3Schindelin H. Kisker C. Hilton J. Rajagopalan K.V. Rees D.C. Science. 1996; 272: 1615-1621Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar) shows the S2′ thiolate of the Q pterin at the non-bonding distance of 3.1 Å from the molybdenum, suggesting at least partial dissociation of the Q pterin although it is unclear whether the structure represents the physiologically relevant reduced enzyme. Additionally, EXAFS analysis of R. sphaeroides Me2SO reductase performed by George et al. (10George G.N. Hilton J. Temple C. Prince R.C. Rajagopalan K.V. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1999; 121: 1256-1266Crossref Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 12George G.N. Hilton J. Rajagopalan K.V. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1996; 118: 1113-1117Crossref Scopus (125) Google Scholar) suggests only 3 thiolate ligands (in addition to two molybdenum-O/N interactions) to the molybdenum in the reduced enzyme, although the results are admittedly ambiguous. Finally, recent mutagenesis of the active site residue Trp116 to phenylalanine in the R. capsulatus enzyme (31Ridge J.P. Aguey-Zinsou K.-F. Bernhardt P.V. Hanson G.R. McEwan A.G. FEBS Lett. 2004; 563: 197-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) results in catalytically impeded Me2SO reductase with an oxidized visible spectrum akin to that of the HEPES-modified enzyme leading the authors to propose a similar monodithiolene, pentacoordinate molybdenum geometry. The Reaction of Reduced Me2SO Reductase with Me2SO— With the pH dependence of the absorption spectra established, the rapid reaction kinetics of reduced Me2SO reductase with Me2SO was investigated over the pH range 6–10. The reaction was found to be biphasic under all reaction conditions investigated at pH 8.0 and below, although non-ideal 2Above pH 8 the behavior of the oxidative transient for Ered·Me2SO decay become increasingly non-ideal. This is also evidenced by loss of the tight isosbestic points as seen at lower pH values (Fig. 2). The rate of substrate binding appears not to be effected as pH increases in that the characteristic substrate-bound intermediate is observed in the dead-time of the diode-array instrument. This suggests the possibility of an additional kinetic process in the reduction of Me2SO, which becomes rate-limiting as pH increases above 8. Presumably, this would be best represented by product release from an Eox·DMS complex and further examination of this phenomenon will be carried out. behavior following substrate binding was observed at high pH that suggests an additional, unresolved phase in the oxidative half-reaction. The fast phase of the reaction could only be monitored easily at relatively low concentrations of Me2SO, low temperature, and was best observed at pH 6.0, where large extinction changes were associated with the reaction. Representative kinetic transients from the initial, fast phase of the reaction at pH 6.0, as followed at 374 and 550 nm can be seen in Supplemental Materials Fig. S2. Hyperbolic fits to the data at pH 6.0 and 5 °C yielded an extrapolated limiting rate constant at high [Me2SO] of ∼1000 s–1 and an apparent KdMe2SO of ∼155 μm. This indicates that the Ered·Me2SO intermediate formed upon addition of Me2SO results from breakdown of a prior enzyme-substrate complex and does not itself represent the initial Michaelis complex for the reaction. Because of the fast reaction rates and relatively small extinction changes observed at higher pH values, it was not possible to accurately determine the pH dependence of the fast phase of the reaction at higher pH values. The intermediate formed at the end of the initial phase of the reaction was essentially identical to that observed upon reaction of oxidized enzyme with excess DMS (5Adams B. Smith A.T. Bailey S."

Identifying the biochemical and molecular mechanisms underlying the events leading to tumors is paramount to designing new and effective treatments that may aid in treating and/or preventing skin cancers. Herein we identify p38 MAPK, along with its positive modulator, Gadd45a, as important regulators of nucleocytoplasmic shuttling of the adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) tumor suppressor. APC normally functions to block β-catenin from promoting cell proliferation and migration/invasion. Keratinocytes lacking proper p38 MAPK activation, either due to lack of Gadd45a or through the use of p38 MAPK-specific inhibitors, are unable to effectively transport APC into the nucleus. We also show that p38 MAPK is able to directly associate with and modulate both casein kinase 2 (CK2) and protein kinase A (PKA), which promote and block APC nuclear import, respectively. We demonstrate that p38 MAPK is able to not only enhance CK2 kinase activity but also suppress PKA kinase activity. Moreover, lack of normal p38 MAPK activity in either Gadd45a-null keratinocytes or in p38 MAPK inhibitor treated keratinocytes leads to decreased CK2 activity and increased PKA activity. In either case, disruption of APC nuclear import results in elevated levels of free cellular, and potentially oncogenic, β-catenin. Numerous tumors, including skin cancers, are associated with high levels of β-catenin, and our data indicate that p38 MAPK signaling, along with Gadd45a, may provide tumor suppressor-like functions in part by promoting APC nuclear localization and effective β-catenin regulation.

One pathway that is affected by inadequate MAPK signaling is the APC/β-catenin signaling pathway (4Hildesheim J. Belova G.I. Tyner S.D. Zhou X. Vardanian L. Fornace A.J.J. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 1829-1837Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Deregulation and/or mutations in either APC complex proteins or its substrate, β-catenin, are linked to numerous cancers, including skin tumors such as basal and squamous cell carcinomas, melanomas, keratoacanthomas, and pilomatricomas (5Morin P.J. BioEssays. 1999; 21: 1021-1030Crossref PubMed Scopus (810) Google Scholar, 6Peifer M. Polakis P. Science. 2000; 287: 1606-1609Crossref PubMed Scopus (1137) Google Scholar, 7Polakis P.

At the plasma membrane, β-catenin functions as an intracellular component of the adherens junctions complex which is important in cell-cell contact (10Ozawa M. Baribault H. Kemler R. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 1711-1717Crossref PubMed Scopus (1143) Google Scholar, 11Nagafuchi A. Takeichi M. Tsukita S.

Alternatively, unbound, soluble β-catenin may localize to the nucleus, where it functions as a transcription factor in association with T-cell factor (TCF). The β-catenin/TCF bipartite transcription factor is known to target and induce the expression of genes such as c-MYC, cyclin D1, and MMP-7 (matrix metalloproteinase 7), which are involved in promoting cell proliferation, migration, and metastasis (5Morin P.J.

Consequently, increased levels of β-catenin protein contribute to tumorigenesis and, therefore, require strict modulation.The primary modulator of β-catenin protein levels is the APC tumor suppressor. APC protein itself will modulate β-catenin protein levels and function on two fronts: in the cytoplasm, APC will function as part of a destruction complex along with several other proteins including Axin, protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A), glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK3β), and casein kinase 1ϵ (CK1ϵ). The primary cytoplasmic function of the APC complex is to phosphorylate β-catenin and direct it for ubiquitination and immediate proteasome degradation (19Ikeda S. Kishida S. Yamamoto H. Murai H. Koyama S. Kikuchi A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1371-1384Crossref PubMed Scopus (1092) Google Scholar, 20Hagen T. Vidal-Puig A. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Tse G. Putti T. Scolyer R. Lee S. Pathology. 2004; 36: 120-128Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). In the nucleus, APC will function to block the transcriptional activity of β-catenin and also to chaperone β-catenin out of the nucleus and into the cytoplasm either for degradation or for assembly at adherens junctions (23Henderson B.R. Fagotto F. EMBO Rep. 2002; 3: 834-839Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar).In general, proper nucleocytoplasmic transport is an important cellular regulatory mechanism that enables tumor suppressors to adequately perform their essential functions, without which may result in protein mislocalization and consequently loss of function (24Hood J.K. Silver P.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1471: M31-M41PubMed Google Scholar, 25Fabbro M. Henderson B.R. Exp. Cell Res. 2003; 282: 59-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). In light of this, it has become increasingly evident that nucleocytoplasmic shuttling of APC is a tightly regulated process (26Henderson B.R. Nat.

Chem. 2001; 276: 45833-45839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Normally, APC is predominantly cytoplasmic and its nuclear import is mediated by a combination of NLS-dependent and NLS-independent elements that require the importin-α/β receptor pathway or B56α PP2A subunit chaperone pathway, respectively (30Neufeld K.L. Zhang F. Cullen B.R. White R.L. EMBO Rep. 2000; 1: 519-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 31Galea M.A. Eleftheriou A. Henderson B.R. J. Biol.

A. 1997; 94: 3034-3039Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Both APC NLS elements are flanked by casein kinase 2 (CK2) and protein kinase A (PKA) phosphorylation sites that positively and negatively regulate APC nuclear import, respectively (28Zhang F. White R.L. Neufeld K.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 12577-12582Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 30Neufeld K.L. Zhang F. Cullen B.R. White R.L. EMBO Rep. 2000; 1: 519-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). While truncated APC mutants lacking both NLS elements are able to translocate to the nucleus, studies indicate that both NLS sites are required for optimal nuclear import and that multiple NLS elements increase nuclear import (28Zhang F. White R.L. Neufeld K.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 12577-12582Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar).Similar to CK2, kinases within the MAPK signaling cascade have also been reported to modulate nuclear translocation of numerous targets. For instance, p38 MAPK is known to phosphorylate and contribute to proper nuclear translocation of Smad3/4, estrogen receptor ERα, heat shock protein HSP27, and AP-1 family transcription factors, among others (33Granet C.

Relative to APC/β-catenin, we recently demonstrated that normal sustained MAPK signaling via Gadd45a is necessary for proper APC complex activation and consequently modulation of soluble β-catenin levels (4Hildesheim J. Belova G.I. Tyner S.D. Zhou X. Vardanian L. Fornace A.J.J. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 1829-1837Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Herein we demonstrate that not only is MAPK signaling necessary for proper APC, and subsequently β-catenin, cellular compartmentalization, but that p38 MAPK associates with both CK2 and PKA with diametrically opposing effects, i.e. enhancing CK2 kinase activity while suppressing PKA kinase activity. Inadequate MAPK activity ultimately results in APC cytoplasmic sequestration, along with β-catenin nuclear accumulation and inefficient degradation. These observations provide further evidence that p38 MAPK behaves as a tumor suppressor and that deregulated MAPK signaling may contribute to tumorigenesis by disrupting normal nucleocytoplasmic shuttling regulation.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCell Culture—Primary mouse keratinocytes were derived from wt and Gadd45a-null newborn mice as described previously (3Hildesheim J.

In brief, the epidermis is separated from the underlying dermis with Dispase and subsequently trypsinized to obtain single cells. Isolated keratinocytes are in turn seeded onto sterile cover slips and cultured with serum-free medium as specified by the manufacturer (keratinocyte-SFM defined medium, Invitrogen Corp.). SB202190 (Calbiochem) treatment (10 μm) was performed for 8 h prior to either fixation or lysis. β-Gal-NLS1APC and β-Gal-NLS2APC constructs were obtained from Dr. Kristi Neufeld and were transfected into primary mouse keratinocytes with Lipofectamine 2000 according to manufacturer's specifications (Invitrogen Corp.).Immunocytochemistry—Cultured keratinocytes were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde at room temperature for 10 min, followed by permeabilization with 0.2% Triton X-100 for 5 min after washing fixed cells with 1× PBS. Following the permeabilization step, cells were washed with 1× PBS and quenched with fresh 0.1% sodium borohydride for 5 min. Next, cells were blocked with either horse or goat serum for 60 min at room temperature and followed by overnight incubation at 4 °C with the primary antibody diluted with 1% BSA in 1× PBS. Subsequently, cells were washed with 1× PBS and incubated with secondary fluorescent-labeled antibody for 45 min at room temperature. After washing the cells with 1× PBS, coverslips were mounted with VectaShield with DAPI (Vector Laboratories, Inc., catalog number H-1200) and analyzed by immunofluorescent microscopy. Primary antibodies used, with specified dilutions, were as follows: β-catenin, rabbit IgG (1:2000, Cell Signaling Technology); β-Gal, mouse IgG (1:1000, Promega). Secondary antibodies used were as follows: Cy™3-conjugated donkey anti-mouse IgG or Cy™3-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgG (1:2000, Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories).Immunoprecipitation—Cultured primary keratinocytes were lysed in buffer composed of: 1% Triton X-100, 20 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 2.5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. PKA was immunoprecipitated from equal amounts of lysate using anti-PKA antibodies (Upstate Biotechnology) followed by incubation with protein A-Sepharose. The immunoprecipitate was washed twice with kinase buffer (Upstate Biotechnology). CK2 immunoprecipitation was performed with agarose conjugated anti-CKIIa antibodies (Santa Cruz) and processed as described for PKA above. Washed immunoprecipitates were then utilized for kinase assays as described below.For co-immunoprecipitation studies, purified bacterially expressed GST-p38 (or GST alone as control) was incubated along with glutathione-Sepharose beads (4 Fast Flow, Amersham Biosciences). Subsequently, GST and GST-p38 samples were washed three times in lysis buffer and incubated with primary keratinocyte lysates at 4 °C. Next, samples were washed five times in lysis buffer and resolved by SDS-PAGE (10% gels).Immunoblot—Primary mouse keratinocyte cytoplasmic and nuclear fractionations were performed with the NE-PER nuclear and cytoplasmic extraction reagent (NER and CER, respectively) as specified by the manufacturer (Pierce). In brief, 5 × 106 cells were trypsinized (0.05% trypsin, 0.53 mm EDTA) and resuspended in 200 μl of CER I lysis buffer. After a 10-min ice-cold incubation, 11 μl of CER II buffer was added to sample followed by centrifugation to pellet the nuclei. After centrifugation, the supernatant was stored for use as the cytoplasmic fraction, and the nuclei were lysed with 100 μl of NER lysis buffer. SDS-PAGE with either 10% or 12% acrylamide gels (Novex precasted gels, Invitrogen Corp.) was performed followed by blotting onto Immobilon™-P transfer membrane (Millipore Corp.). Protein detection by chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences) on membranes was conducted according to standard protocols supplied by Cell Signaling Technology. Primary antibodies used were as follows: APC, C-20 clone (1: 100, Santa Cruz); P-β-catenin (1:200, Cell Signaling Technology); P-GSK3β (1:200, Cell Signaling Technology); MCM7 (1:500, Santa Cruz); Actin, Ab-1 clone (1:5000, Oncogene). Secondary antibodies used were as follows: anti-rabbit IgG, horseradish peroxidase linked F(ab′)2 fragment (1:2000, Amersham Biosciences) or anti-mouse IgG horseradish peroxidase-linked whole antibody (1:2000, Amersham Biosciences).Kinase Assay—Activity assays for both PKA and CK2 were performed as specified by Upstate Biotechnology. For PKA, 200 μg of immunoprecipitate in 10-μl volume was added to the following: assay dilution buffer (20 μl), 20 μm cAMP (5 μl), Leu-Arg-Arg-Ala-Ser-Leu-Gly (Kemptide) substrate (5 μl), PKC/calmodulin kinase inhibitor (10 μl), and Mg2+/ATP mixture containing [γ-32P]ATP. Reactions were carried out for 10 min at 30 °C and subsequently 25 μl of sample was blotted onto P81 phosphocellulose paper. Blotted P81 paper was washed with 0.75% phosphoric acid, dried with acetone, and transferred to scintillation vials for counts. Background counts from reactions minus Kemptide substrate was subtracted from the counts from enzyme samples. The CK2 activity assay was performed in the same manner with the following exceptions: CK2 substrate peptide was used instead of Kemptide, PKA inhibitor was used instead of PKC inhibitor, and 20 μl of 40% trichloroacetic acid was added to reaction mix immediately following 10 min incubation at 30 °C.RESULTSp38 MAPK Activity Promotes APC Nuclear Localization—We have previously established that APC complex activation in part requires adequate and sustained p38 MAPK activity (4Hildesheim J. Belova G.I. Tyner S.D. Zhou X. Vardanian L. Fornace A.J.J. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 1829-1837Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Moreover, Gadd45a, a positive modulator of p38 MAPK signaling, associates with and enhances APC complex activity (4Hildesheim J. Belova G.I. Tyner S.D. Zhou X. Vardanian L. Fornace A.J.J. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 1829-1837Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Since proper APC function as a β-catenin modulator necessitates effective shuttling in and out of the nucleus, we investigated the possibility that APC localization may be affected by a disruption in p38 MAPK signaling. Due to the fact that normally APC protein levels are low in wild type (wt) keratinocytes (28Zhang F. White R.L. Neufeld K.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 12577-12582Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), 2J. Hildesheim, Jr., personal observation. to verify the localization status of APC we conducted immunocytochemistry on primary keratinocytes that were transfected with plasmids coding for β-galactosidase linked to either one of the two APC NLS elements (β-Gal-NLS1APC and β-Gal-NLS2APC). The results show that neither Gadd45a-null keratinocytes (Fig. 1A) nor p38 MAPK inhibitor-treated wt keratinocytes (Fig. 1B) demonstrate nuclear localization of β-Gal-NLSAPC. Irrespective of the construct, transfected wt, untreated keratinocyte controls show β-Gal-NLSAPC localizing either in the nucleus or cytoplasm with similar frequency. In stark contrast, APC NLS-β-Gal localized predominantly in the cytoplasm or perinuclear region of Gadd45a-null and p38 MAPK inhibitor-treated wt keratinocytes, respectively. This phenotypic observation indicates that disruption of p38 MAPK signaling does affect APC subcellular transport and prevents APC from entering the nucleus.p38 MAPK Signaling Is Necessary for Proper β-Catenin Localization—While there is a clear disruption of normal APC nuclear shuttling in keratinocytes lacking adequate p38 MAPK signaling, to determine how this disruption may affect APC function, we also investigated the status of β-catenin, a key substrate of the APC complex. Immunocytochemical analysis revealed that while β-catenin expression in wt keratinocytes is predominantly cytoplasmic, β-catenin localization in Gadd45a-null keratinocytes appeared to be primarily nuclear/perinuclear (Fig. 2A). This observation correlates with the absence of APC nuclear localization in light of the fact that the export of β-catenin from the nucleus may involve APC as a chaperone (29Neufeld K.L. Nix D.A. Bogerd H. Kang Y. Beckerle M.C. Cullen B.R. White R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 12085-12090Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). To demonstrate that the observed phenotypic manifestation is a result of inadequate p38 MAPK signaling, wt keratinocytes were treated with the p38 MAPK inhibitor. To a great extent, the effects of SB202190 treatment on wt cells recapitulate the phenotype observed with Gadd45a-null cells. Blocking p38 MAPK activity results in β-catenin accumulating in either nuclear and/or perinuclear region (Fig. 2B). Consequently, inadequate p38 MAPK activity and/or lack of Gadd45a may contribute to β-catenin mislocalization as a result of improper APC shuttling.Fig. 2p38 MAPK activity and β-catenin subcellular localization. In A, β-catenin (red label) cellular localization was visualized by fluorescent microscopy on cultured primary mouse keratinocytes derived from either wild type (WT) or Gadd45a-null (Gadd45a–/–) mice. While wt cells have β-catenin localize predominatly in the cytoplasm, Gadd45a-null cells have β-catenin restricted to the nucleus. DAPI stain (blue) is used to define the nucleus. In B, wt primary keratinocytes were subjected to SB202190 p38 MAPK inhibitor treatment (+Inhib). While untreated wt cells (–Inhib) have β-catenin localized predominantly in the cytoplasm, β-catenin localization in SB202190-treated cells shifted significantly from the cytoplasmic space to either the nuclear or perinuclear areas. Two representative fields for each of the culture conditions (–Inhib or +Inhib) are shown.

The data presented in Fig. 3 demonstrate that lack of Gadd45a protein leads to three key observations: 1) compromised APC nucleocytoplasmic shuttling, 2) a dramatic increase in cytoplasmic and nuclear β-catenin protein levels, and 3) reduced GSK3β activity as determined by a modest increase in phosphorylated GSK3β, the inactive form of this being kinase. Similarly, wt cells treated with the p38 MAPK inhibitor have altered APC localization accompanied by increased cytoplasmic and nuclear β-catenin.Fig. 3Correlation between p38 MAPK signaling, APC localization, and β-catenin expression levels. Immunoblots were performed with the indicated antibodies on cytoplasmic (Cyt) and nuclear (Nuc) fractions obtained from wild-type (WT) and Gadd45a-null (Gadd45a–/–) primary mouse keratinocytes. On one hand, wt, untreated (–SB202190) cells have low levels of cytoplasmic APC and soluble β-catenin proteins, accompanied by relatively low levels of phosphorylated (and presumably inactive) GSK3β using anti-Ser9-specific antibody. Under these conditions, APC is localized predominantly in the nucleus, while both β-catenin and GSK3β are found exclusively in the cytoplasm. On the other hand, Gadd45a-null (Gadd45a–/–) untreated cells have APC protein localized exclusively in the cytoplasm. This nuclear exclusion of APC is accompanied by relatively high levels of soluble β-catenin in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, along with increased level of phosphorylated (and inactive) cytoplasmic GSK3β relative to wt cells. Treatment of wt cells with p38 MAPK inhibitor (+SB202190) results in increased accumulation of APC in the cytoplasm along with increased accumulation of soluble cytoplasmic and nuclear β-catenin. The p38 MAPK inhibitor, SB202190, appeared to have only a slight effect on GSK3β activity status. Total GSK3β levels remain unchanged (data not shown and Ref. 4Hildesheim J. Belova G.I. Tyner S.D. Zhou X. Vardanian L. Fornace A.J.J. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 1829-1837Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). MCM7 and Actin are utilized as a nuclear marker and as a loading control, respectively.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)While untreated wt cells have APC localized predominantly in the nucleus, untreated Gadd45a-null keratinocytes retain APC almost exclusively in the cytoplasm. Moreover, in untreated wt cells, soluble β-catenin levels are relatively low and present exclusively in the cytoplasm. This is in stark contrast to untreated Gadd45a-null cells that have dramatically higher levels of soluble β-catenin protein in both the cytoplasm and nucleus.Interestingly, while wt cells appear to have more active GSK3β relative to Gadd45a-null cells (as determined by lower levels of phosphorylated protein), SB202190 treatment of wt cells results in only a small change in GSK3β activity (as determined by the level of phosphorylated form) within the 8-h treatment period. This may be attributed to the fact that GSK3β activation is mediated primarily through its direct association with Gadd45a protein (4Hildesheim J. Belova G.I. Tyner S.D. Zhou X. Vardanian L. Fornace A.J.J. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 1829-1837Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) and that transient p38 MAPK activity inhibition will not necessarily reduce Gadd45a protein levels and, consequently, not interfere with its ability to regulate GSK3β activity.Since GSK3β activity does not appear to be substantially compromised within the treatment timeframe, our data indicate that the effects of SB202190 on preventing proper β-catenin degradation are likely due to interference with the nucleocytoplasmic shuttling of APC. As with wt cells, Gadd45a-null keratinocytes demonstrated only a slight decrease in GSK3β activity following SB202190 treatment. This likely results from the fact that, as previously established, p38 MAPK and GSK3β activity is already compromised in Gadd45a-null keratinocytes (3Hildesheim J. Bulavin D.V. Anver M.R. Alvord W.G.

Random mutagenesis and screening by functional complementation in yeast for clones with reduced sensitivities to dipyridamole yielded mutations at Ile429 in TM 11 of CeENT1 and Met33 in TM 1 of hENT1. Mutational analysis of the corresponding residues of both proteins suggested important roles for these residues in competitive inhibition of hENT1 and CeENT1 by dipyridamole. To verify the roles of these residues in dipyridamole interactions, hENT2, which naturally exhibits low dipyridamole sensitivity, was mutated to contain side chains favorable for high affinity dipyridamole binding (i.e. a Met at the TM 1 and/or an Ile at the TM 11 positions). The single mutants exhibited increased hENT2 sensitivity to inhibition by dipyridamole, and the double mutant was the most sensitive, with an IC50 value that was only 2% of that of wild type. Functional analysis of the TM 1 and 11 mutants of hENT1 and CeENT1 revealed that Ala and Thr in the TM 1 and 11 positions, respectively, impaired uridine and adenosine transport and that Leu442 of hENT1 was involved in permeant selectivity.

Several studies have addressed the mechanism of dipyridamole binding, which appears to compete with permeants and NBMPR for binding to the outward facing aspect of mammalian es transporters at nanomolar concentrations, although allosteric properties have been observed at micromolar concentrations (16Jarvis S.M.

Knowledge of the amino acid residues involved in dipyridamole interactions with ENTs is limited. In previous work, we screened a library of hENT1 mutants for clones with reduced sensitivity to dilazep, resulting in the identification of residue 33 of hENT1 and hENT2 as important determinants of not only dilazep but also dipyridamole interactions (12Visser F.

The aim of this study was to use a similar approach to identify amino acid residues of hENT1 and CeENT1 involved in dipyridamole interactions. Initially, we determined that dipyridamole was a competitive inhibitor of both uridine and adenosine influx mediated by recombinant hENT1 and CeENT1 produced in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, a result that supports a common structural model for dipyridamole binding by the two proteins. hENT1 and CeENT1 were then subjected to random mutagenesis and screened for dipyridamole-resistant clones by phenotypic complementation in S. cerevisiae. The hENT1 clones contained mutations in Met33 in TM 1, whereas the CeENT1 clones contained mutations in Ile429 in TM 11. Several different mutations of the corresponding residues of both proteins were generated and tested for dipyridamole sensitivity and uridine transport characteristics. The mutations that yielded the highest dipyridamole sensitivities for both proteins (Met in TM 1 and Ile in TM 11) were introduced into hENT2 to assess their involvement in dipyridamole interactions with this other important ENT family member. The hENT1 and CeENT1 mutants were also assessed for their ability to transport uridine and adenosine. Mutants that displayed altered dipyridamole sensitivity but unaltered uridine kinetics were subjected to Dixon plot analysis to determine whether the competitive nature of inhibition had been changed by the mutations. Mechanistic and structural models of TMs 1 and 11 with respect to dipyridamole and permeant interactions are proposed. The results reported here indicated that the TM 1 and 11 residues were important for dipyridamole interactions and uridine transport by hENT1 and CeENT1.

The point mutations resulting in the CeENT1-I49M and -I49A, and I429L, the hENT1-M33I, -M33A, -L442I, and -L442T and the hENT2-I33M, -L442I, and -I33M/L442I changes in amino acid sequence were generated using megaprimer PCR methodology (25Sarkar G. Sommer S.S. BioTechniques. 1990; 8: 404-407PubMed Google Scholar). The hENT1 double mutants were generated by swapping the 0.6-kb XbaI-EcoRI fragment containing either the M33I or M33A mutations with the corresponding fragment in the plasmid containing the L442I mutation. The CeENT1 double mutants were generated by swapping the 1-kb NotI-SalI fragment containing either the I429L or I429T mutation with the corresponding fragment in the plasmid containing the I49M mutation. Phenotypic Complementation and Screening of Mutants—The complementation assay was based on the ability of recombinant hENT1 or CeENT1 produced in yeast to salvage exogenously supplied thymidine under conditions of dTMP starvation (26Vickers M.F. Mani R.S. Sundaram M. Hogue D.L. Young J.D. Baldwin S.A. Cass C.E. Biochem. J. 1999; 339: 21-32Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In brief, KTK cells transformed with pYPhENT1 or pYPCeENT1 using a lithium acetate procedure (23Gietz D. St. Jean A. Woods R.A. Schiestl R.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 1425Crossref PubMed Scopus (2895) Google Scholar) were plated directly onto CMM/GLU plates containing methotrexate (MTX) at 50 μg/ml and sulfanilamide (SAA) at 6 mg/ml (CMM/GLU/MTX/SAA) at a pH of 7.0. Colonies formed with an efficiency of ∼105 transformants/μg DNA after incubation at 30 °C for 3.5 days in the presence of 10 μm thymidine, and complementation was prevented when 100 μm dipyridamole was also present. Mutated pYP-CeENT1 (20 μg) was transformed into KTK cells, which were then plated onto CMM/GLU/MTX/SAA with 10 μm thymidine and 100 μm dipyridamole and incubated at 30 °C for 3.5 days. Colonies with apparent resistance to dipyridamole inhibition of complementation were isolated, grown in 1 ml of liquid CMM/GLU for 2 days, and restreaked onto CMM/GLU/MTX/SAA plates with 10 μm thymidine and 100 μm dipyridamole. The mutant CeENT1 cDNAs were amplified from the yeast colonies by PCR, subcloned back into nonmutated pYPGE15, and sequenced. Nucleoside Transport in S. cerevisiae—Yeast cells containing pY-PhENT1, pYPCeENT1, or one of the various mutant transporters were grown in CMM/GLU medium to A600 = 0.5–1.2, washed twice in fresh medium and resuspended to A600 = 4.0. Transport assays were performed at room temperature and pH 7.4. Unlabeled nucleosides and dipyridamole were obtained from Sigma, and radiolabeled compounds were obtained from Moravek Biochemicals (Brea, CA). The transport assays were performed in 96-well plates as previously described (27Zhang J. Visser F. Vickers M.F. Lang T. Robins M.J. Nielsen L.P.C. Nowak I. Baldwin S.A. Young J.D. Cass C.E. Mol.

Briefly, 50-μl portions of yeast suspensions were added to 50-μl portions of 2× concentrated [3H]nucleoside in 96-well microtiter plates. Because the initial rates of uridine transport into yeast cells producing recombinant ENTs persist for intervals of 30–40 min (12Visser F. Vickers M.F. Ng A.M. Baldwin S.A. Young J.D. Cass C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 395-401Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar), single time points of either 10 or 20 min were used to estimate initial rates of transport. Trace uridine transport activity in fui1:TRP1 yeast caused by the presence of the endogenous uracil/uridine permease, FUR4, was subtracted by determining background uptake in the presence of 10 mm thymidine, which does not interact with any endogenous transport systems (34Grenson M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1969; 11: 249-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Yeast cells were collected on filter mats using a Micro96 Cell Harvester (Skatron Instruments, Lier, Norway) and rapidly washed with deionized water. The individual filter circles corresponding to wells of the microtiter plates were removed from filter mats with forceps and transferred to vials for quantification of radioactivity by scintillation counting. For dipyridamole concentration-effect relationships, the yeast suspensions were first incubated for 15–30 min with dipyridamole to allow equilibration of the inhibitor with its binding sites before the addition of radiolabeled permeant as previously described (12Visser F.

Dixon Plot Analysis of Dipyridamole Inhibition of hENT1 and CeENT1—To determine whether dipyridamole inhibited hENT1 and CeENT1 by a common mechanism, yeast cells producing recombinant hENT1 or CeENT1 were incubated with 10, 25, or 100 μm [3H]adenosine in the absence or presence of increasing concentrations of dipyridamole. Dixon plot analysis (32Dixon M. Biochem. J. 1953; 55: 170-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (3290) Google Scholar) of these data suggested that dipyridamole was a competitive inhibitor of adenosine transport for both proteins, with Ki values of 30 ± 1 and 400 ± 20 nm, respectively, for hENT1 and CeENT1 (Fig. 1, A and B, and Table I). In a similar experiment, yeast cells producing recombinant hENT1 or CeENT1 were incubated with 50, 150, or 500 μm [3H]uridine in the absence or presence of increasing concentrations of dipyridamole. Dixon plot analysis of the resulting data suggested that dipyridamole was also a competitive inhibitor of uridine transport for both hENT1 and CeENT1 with Ki values of 40 ± 4 and 310 ± 40 nm, respectively (Fig. 1, C and D, and Table I) (32Dixon M.

J. Biochem. 1969; 11: 249-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), heterologous production of hENT1 results in transport of extracellular thymidine, which is subsequently metabolized to TMP by recombinant herpes simplex thymidine kinase in KTK cells, bypassing the methotrexate/sulfanilamide-induced growth arrest (20Hogue D.L.

The yeast expression plasmids pYPCeENT1 and pYPhENT1 were randomly mutated by propagation in the XL-1 RED mutator strain of E. coli (Stratagene) and screened by complementation in KTK yeast cells for functional mutants with reduced sensitivity to dipyridamole (i.e. for mutants that could salvage extracellular thymidine in the presence of dipyridamole). Screening of a hENT1 cDNA mutant library for dipyridamole resistance resulted in the isolation of >20 clones, all of which contained mutations in codon 33, which corresponds to Met33, a residue previously identified in screens of a hydroxylamine-mutated hENT1 library for resistance to dilazep, an inhibitor of hENT1 and hENT2 (12Visser F. Vickers M.F. Ng A.M. Baldwin S.A. Young J.D. Cass C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 395-401Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) that is structurally unrelated to dipyridamole (see Fig. 2 for chemical structures). Four separate screens of the CeENT1 libraries resulted in the isolation of five clones, four of which did not contain mutations in the CeENT1 cDNA, and one of which contained a mutation in codon 429, resulting in the conversion of Ile429 in putative TM 11 to Thr. Multiple sequence alignments of TM 1 of human, rat, and C. elegans ENT1 and ENT2 revealed that Met is present at residue 33 in dipyridamole-sensitive hENT1, whereas Ile is present in the dipyridamole-insensitive transporters rENT1, rENT2, and hENT2 (Fig. 3). The corresponding TM 1 residue in CeENT1 and CeENT2 (i.e. Ile 49) was the same as in the dipyridamole-insensitive mammalian transporters. TM 1 also contains two highly conserved Gly residues, which are present in all six transporters, that may be involved in helix-helix contacts (7Hyde R.J. Cass C.E. Young J.D. Baldwin S.A. Mol. Membr. Biol. 2001; 18: 53-63Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); these residues correspond to Gly22 and Gly24 of hENT1. Multiple sequence alignments of TM 11 of human, rat, and C. elegans ENT1 and ENT2 revealed that the four mammalian transporters contain a Leu, whereas both CeENT1 and CeENT2 contain an Ile at the corresponding positions (i.e. positions 442 in hENT1 and 429 in CeENT1). This result suggested that the positions occupied by either Leu or Ile were not responsible for the observed differences in dipyridamole sensitivities of the transporters. Because the Leu/Ile residue of TM 11 is the second residue of a highly conserved GXXXG helix-helix interaction motif (7Hyde R.J. Cass C.E. Young J.D. Baldwin S.A. Mol. Membr.

Concentration-Effect Relationships for Dipyridamole Inhibition of hENT1, CeENT1, and Various Mutants—To determine the effects of mutations at Met33 and Leu442 of hENT1 and Ile49 and Ile429 of CeENT1, site-directed mutagenesis was undertaken at these positions. Eight of the resulting mutants (hENT1-M33I, -M33A, -L442T, and -L442I and CeENT1-I49M, -I49A, -I429L, and -I429T) exhibited transport activity, whereas two (hENT1-M33T and -L442A) did not (data not shown). Yeast producing CeENT1, hENT1, or one of the various functionally active mutants were incubated in the absence (controls) or presence of increasing concentrations of dipyridamole (Table I and Figs. 4, A and B). The hENT1-M33I and hENT1-M33A mutants displayed significantly higher IC50 values (27- and >1000-fold higher, respectively) than that of hENT1, whereas CeENT1, CeENT1-I49M, and CeENT1-I49A displayed IC50 values similar to that of hENT1. CeENT1-I429L and -I429T displayed IC50 values that were 4- and 20-fold higher, respectively, than that of CeENT1, whereas the values of hENT1-L442T and -L442I were, respectively, similar to and 34% of the hENT1 value. These results showed that the dipyridamole sensitivity of CeENT1 was affected by the TM 11 but not the TM 1 mutations, whereas the sensitivity of hENT1 was affected by both TM 1 and 11 mutations. rENT1, which is relatively insensitive to dipyridamole (38Yao S.Y. Ng A.M. Muzyka W.R. Griffiths M. Cass C.E. Baldwin S.A. Young J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28423-28430Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar), contains an Ile at the TM 1 position and a Leu at the TM 11 position. The concentration-effect relationship for dipyridamole inhibition of rENT1 yielded an IC50 value of 10500 ± 2300 nm, which was 58- and 350-fold higher than the values for CeENT1 and hENT1, respectively (Table I). Although much less sensitive to dipyridamole inhibition than either hENT1 or CeENT1, rENT1 was capable of interacting with dipyridamole. That both hENT1 and rENT1 contain a Leu residue at the TM 11 position suggested that this residue contributed to dipyridamole binding by both transporters rather than being responsible for their differences in sensitivity. For both hENT1 and CeENT1, the presence of a Met at the TM 1 and an Ile at the TM 11 positions was consistent with their high sensitivities to dipyridamole. These residues were further investigated by combining the CeENT1 TM 11 mutants with reduced sensitivities (I429L and I429T) with the TM 1 mutant with high sensitivity (I49M) and assessing the concentration-effect relationships for dipyridamole inhibition of uridine transport by the resulting double mutants (CeENT1-I49M/I429L and -I49M/I429T) in experiments summarized in Table I. CeENT1-I49M/I429T displayed an IC50 value that was 22% of that of CeENT1-I429T and 4-fold higher than that of CeENT1 (see also Fig. 4B). CeENT1-I49M/I429L displayed an IC50 value that was 24% of that of CeENT1-I429L and similar to that of CeENT1. The partial and complete restoration of sensitivity to dipyridamole in the two residue 429 mutants by the presence of a Met residue at position 49 suggested a functional interaction between TMs 1 and 11 in binding of dipyridamole by CeENT1. To complement these observations on CeENT1, the hENT1 TM 1 mutants, which were less sensitive to dipyridamole than wild type hENT1, were combined with the L442I mutation. The concentration-effect relationships for dipyridamole inhibition of uridine transport by hENT1-M33I/L442I and -M33A/L442I were then determined (Table I). hENT1-M33I/L442I displayed an IC50 value that was 13% of that of hENT1-M33I and 4-fold higher than that of hENT1 (see also Fig. 4A). hENT1-M33A/L442I displayed an IC50 value that was much lower than that of the highly insensitive hENT1-M33A and 20-fold higher than that of hENT1. The observation that the introduction of the L442I mutation to hENT1, hENT1-M33I, and hENT1-M33A decreased their IC50 values for dipyridamole inhibition implied a functional interaction between TMs 1 and 11 in dipyridamole binding by hENT1, similar to the interaction hypothesized above for CeENT1. Thus, the mutational analyses of dipyridamole sensitivity in ENT family members from divergent sources suggested that both the TM 1 and 11 positions contributed to dipyridamole sensitivities. Concentration-Effect Relationships for Dipyridamole Inhibition of hENT2 and Various Mutants—To determine whether the TM 1 and 11 positions also contributed to the relative insensitivity of hENT2 to dipyridamole, site-directed mutagenesis was employed to generate hENT2-I33M, -L442I, and -I33M/L442I.

https://openalex.org/W2114549669,"Two isoforms of an antifungal protein, gastrodianin, were isolated from two subspecies of the orchid <i>Gastrodia elata</i>, belonging to the protein superfamily of monocot mannose-specific lectins. In the context that all available structures in this superfamily are oligomers so far, the crystal structures of the orchid lectins, both at 2.0 Å, revealed a novel monomeric structure. It resulted from the rearrangement of the C-terminal peptide inclusive of the 12th β-strand, which changes from the ""C-terminal exchange"" into a ""C-terminal self-assembly"" mode. Thus, the overall tertiary scaffold is stabilized with an intramolecular β-sheet instead of the hybrid observed on subunit/subunit interface in all known homologous dimeric or tetrameric lectins. In contrast to the constrained extended conformation with a <i>cis</i> peptide bond between residues 98 and 99 commonly occurring in oligomers, a β-hairpin forms from position 97 to 101 with a normal <i>trans</i> peptide bond at the corresponding site in gastrodianin, which determines the topology of the C-terminal peptide and thereby its unique fold pattern. Sequence and structure comparison shows that residue replacement and insertion at the position where the β-hairpin occurs in association with <i>cis-trans</i> inter-conversion of the specific peptide bond (97–98) are possibly responsible for such a radical structure switch between monomers and oligomers. Moreover, this seems to be a common melody controlling the quaternary states among bulb lectins through studies on sequence alignment. The observations revealed a structural mechanism by which the quaternary organization of monocot mannose binding lectins could be governed. The mutation experiment performed on maltose-binding protein-gastrodianin fusion protein followed by a few biochemical detections provides direct evidence to support this conclusion. Potential carbohydrate recognition sites and biological implications of the orchid lectin based on its monomeric state are also discussed in this paper."

A new member of this cluster, apolipoprotein (apo) AV, has recently been discovered as a novel modifier in triglyceride metabolism. To determine the expression of all four apo genes in combination and, most importantly, whether the transcription of apoAV is coregulated by the apoCIII enhancer in the cluster, we generated an intact transgenic line carrying the 116-kb human apoAI/CIII/AIV/AV gene cluster and a mutant transgenic line in which the apoCIII enhancer was deleted from the 116-kb structure. We demonstrated that the apoCIII enhancer regulated hepatic and intestinal apoAI, apoCIII, and apoAIV expression; however, it did not direct the newly identified apoAV in the cluster. Furthermore, human apo genes displayed integrated position-independent expression and a closer approximation of copy number-dependent expression in the intact transgenic mice. Because apoCIII and apoAV play opposite roles in triglyceride homeostasis, we analyzed the lipid profiles in our transgenic mice to assess the effects of human apoAI gene cluster expression on lipid metabolism. The triglyceride level was elevated in intact transgenic mice but decreased in mutant ones compared with nontransgenic mice. In addition, the expression of human apoAI and apoAIV elevated high density lipoprotein cholesterol in transgenic mice fed an atherogenic diet.

Circ. Res. 2004; 94: 993-999Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Besides its important functions, the apoAI cluster is a useful model with which to study the transcriptional regulation and tissue-specific expression of clustered genes. The apo genes in this cluster are expressed at different levels in the liver and intestine: apoAI is expressed at high levels in the liver and intestine, apoCIII synthesis occurs predominantly in the liver and to a much lesser extent in the intestine, and apoAIV is expressed mainly in the intestine and to a lesser extent in the liver (16.Zannis V.I. Kan H.Y. Kritis A. Zanni E.E. Kardassis D. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 2001; 12: 181-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), whereas apoAV is expressed only in the liver (2.Pennacchio L.A. Olivier M. Hubacek J.A. Cohen J.C. Cox D.R. Fruchart J.-C. Krauss R.M. Rubin E.M. Science. 2001; 294: 169-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (788) Google Scholar). Previous transgenic mice carrying one or two apo genes displayed different expression levels, and these short genome fragments may lack much of the genetic information contained in the large flanking sequence for proper expression of the transgenes (16.Zannis V.I. Kan H.Y. Kritis A. Zanni E.E. Kardassis D. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 2001; 12: 181-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). With the increasing interest in research on the gene cluster, more and more important cis-acting elements have been identified to be involved in the transcriptional regulation of the gene cluster in the long distance, and this mechanism differs from that in a single gene (17.Blumenthal T. BioEssays. 1998; 20: 480-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). In the present study, we generated transgenic mice carrying a 116-kb intact genomic fragment containing the entire human apoAI, apoCIII, apoAIV, and apoAV to investigate the expression pattern of these genes in the cluster containing complete flanking sequences in vivo. Previous studies have shown that a common regulatory element, the apoCIII enhancer, located 490–890 bp upstream of apoCIII, regulates tissue-specific expression of apoAI, apoCIII, and apoAIV in vitro and in vivo (16.Zannis V.I. Kan H.Y. Kritis A. Zanni E.E. Kardassis D. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 2001; 12: 181-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). Although the proximal promoter of apoAV has been studied, transcriptional regulation of this newly discovered gene is largely unknown (18.Vu-Dac N. Gervois P. Jakel H. Nowak M. Bauge E. Dehondt H.

Whether apoAV transcription is also regulated by the apoCIII enhancer or by some other element is an interesting question, the answer to which will deepen understanding of the mechanism underlying transcriptional regulation of the apoAI gene cluster. To study these issues, we created a mutant transgenic mouse line containing the 116-kb human apoAI gene cluster in which the apoCIII enhancer core region was deleted. Transgenic lines containing a 33-kb human apoAI/CIII/AIV gene cluster construct were recently generated, in which the expression of transgenes induced hyperlipidema and reduced atherosclerosis (20.Vergnes L. Baroukh N. Ostos M.A. Castro G. Duverger N. Nanjee M.N. Najib J. Fruchart J.C. Miller N.E. Zakin M.M. Ochoa A. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2000; 20: 2267-2274Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). This model carried only a relatively short genomic fragment and did not contain the newly identified apoAV. Because apoCIII and apoAV have predominant but opposite roles in triglyceride homeostasis, to explore the relationship between these two genes and altered triglyceride, Baroukh et al. (21.Baroukh N. Bauge E. Akiyama J. Chang J. Afzal V. Fruchart J.C. Rubin E.M. Fruchart J. Pennacchio L.A. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2004; 24: 1297-1302Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) very recently established another apoAI/CIII/AIV/AV transgenic mouse line and found no differences in triglyceride concentrations between the transgenic and control mice (21.Baroukh N. Bauge E. Akiyama J. Chang J. Afzal V. Fruchart J.C. Rubin E.M. Fruchart J. Pennacchio L.A. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2004; 24: 1297-1302Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Here we investigate the action of apoCIII and apoAV in triglyceride metabolism via our intact and mutant apoAI gene cluster transgenic mice. Furthermore, we used these models to observe the action of apoAI clustered genes as an integrated unit in the change of lipid profiles induced by atherogenic diets. Human Bacterial Artificial Chromosome (BAC) Library Screening and Fluorescence in Situ Hybridization (FISH) Analysis—High density hybrid membranes for the BAC library (Research Genetics, Huntsville, AL) were screened by [α-32P]dCTP-labeled apoAI probe (PCR from human genome; primers: hapoAI-exon-1, 5′-GACCTGCAAGCCTGCAGCACT-3′; hapoAI-exon-2, 5′-CCGATGGTTGGCTCCTAGGTT-3′). Selected BAC DNA was purified by alkaline lysis and digested with different restriction endonucleases including NotI, KpnI, SnaBI, SalI, and XholI. The digested BAC DNA was separated by pulse field gel electrophoresis on 1% agarose (Roche Applied Science), using the 10–250-kb autoprogram of CHEF MAPPER (Bio-Rad). Usually, SnaBI digestion of BAC DNA was transferred to nylon membranes for Southern blot analysis. A physical map of the BAC clone was drawn according to the pulse field gel electrophoresis and Southern blot results. The two terminals of selected positive BAC clone, 286I4, were sequenced, and FISH analysis of the BAC clone was performed as described previously (22.Feng D.X. Liu D.P. Huang Y. Wu L. Li T.C. Wu M. Tang X.B. Liang C.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 15073-15077Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Deletion of the apoCIII Enhancer from BAC DNA—Mutant BAC clones were derived from the wild-type 286I4 BAC clone by temperature-sensitive shuttle vector-mediated homologous recombination. Briefly, two fragments (F1 and F2) located at the two terminals of the target sequences were directly cloned by PCR from BAC 286I4 (primers: 5′-ACCAGGACTGATTCGCTCGTT-3′ (FP1) and 5′-TGTTAGAGGCTCCTTCTGCCT-3′ (RP1) for F1; 5′-GGAGCCACTGATGCCTGGTCT-3 (FP2) and 5′-TTACCTGGAGCAGCTGCCTCT-3′ (RP2) for F2), and the length of each fragment was more than 500 bp. The two fragments were cloned together into the multi-clone sites of constructive vector EGFP to produce plasmid pEGFP-(F1+F2). The (F1+F2) box was then released by SalI and XhoI digestion and inserted into the SalI linearized shuttle vector pSV-RecA. The recombinant shuttle vector pSV-RecA-(F1+F2) was used to transform Escherichia coli DH10B, which harbors a wild-type 286I4 BAC clone. After two rounds of heat-induced homologous recombination, mutant BAC clones were screened by positive (Tet) and counter (FA) selections and verified by Southern blotting with amplified F1 as probe and by PCR with primers FP1 and RP2 (Fig. 2). DNA Purification for Microinjection and Generation of Transgenic Mice—BAC DNA was purified by routine alkaline lysis and CsCl gradient ultracentrifugation. After NotI digestion, the linearized BAC DNA was added to a 0.5 × 5 cm pre-equilibrized Sepharose CL-4B column and collected as described previously (22.Feng D.X. Liu D.P. Huang Y. Wu L. Li T.C. Wu M. Tang X.B. Liang C.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 15073-15077Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The purified intact and mutant BAC 286I4 DNA was diluted to 1.2 ng/μl for pronuclear microinjection into murine zygotes derived from C57BL/6J-mated KM female mice using previously described procedures (22.Feng D.X. Liu D.P. Huang Y. Wu L. Li T.C. Wu M. Tang X.B. Liang C.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 15073-15077Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Detection of Transgenic Mice—The transgenic founders were screened by PCR using the apoAI primers 5′-GACCTGCAAGCCTGCAGCACT-3′ and 5′-CCGATGGTTGGCTCCTAGGTT-3′, which span a 560-bp fragment containing human apoAI exon 1 and its upstream region. Identification was further confirmed by Southern blotting of mouse tail genomic DNA after PstI digestion and hybridization with three different probes: the human apoAI far downstream sequence (181382–181706 in the human genomic sequence; GenBank™ accession number AC007707), human apoCIII gene (118941–119333 in GenBank™ accession number AC007707), and human apoAV upstream (75412–75853 in GenBank™ accession number AC007707). The copy numbers of the founder mice were estimated by densitometric scanning of autoradiograms using a PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences). Positive founder F0 mice were outbred to generate lines of heterozygous mice. RNA Preparation and Analysis—Tissue samples (liver, small intestine, brain, heart, lung, stomach, spleen, kidney, and muscle) from 4–6-week-old mice were collected. Total RNA was extracted from these samples by using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen), dissolved in diethyl pyrocarbonate-treated water and used for RNase protection analysis (RPA) of human apoAI, apoCIII, apoAIV, and apoAV mRNA. In brief, 10 μg of total RNA were hybridized with [α-32P]UTP-labeled probes (1 × 105 cpm) in hybridization solution at 55 °C overnight, followed by RNase A (8 μg/ml) and RNase T1 (10 units/μl) digestion at 25 °C for 30 min and proteinase K treatment. The protected fragments were purified by water-saturated phenol/chloroform and electrophoresed on a 6% polyacrylamide-7 m urea gel. The gel was exposed to an x-ray film for 24–48 h, and the band intensity was quantified by a scanning densitometer (Amersham Biosciences). The apolipoprotein gene-specific probes used in RPA were as follows: mouse G3PDH, pSp6-G3PDH (internal control); human apoAI, pSp6h-apoAI; human apoCIII, pT7h-apoCIII; human apoAIV, pSP6h-apoAIV; and human apoAV, pT7h-apoAV. All constructed plasmids were cloned by our laboratory. Animals and Diets—Transgenic mice containing the intact and mutant 116-kb apoAI gene cluster were used. Nontransgenic littermates were used as controls. Five-week-old transgenic mice and nontransgenic littermates were housed in a temperature-controlled room with alternating 12-h light (7 a.m. to 7 p.m.) and dark (7 p.m. to 7 a.m.) periods. Animals were kept on a regular mouse chow. Male and female mice were used in approximately equal ratio in all experiments. For blood sampling, mice were fasted overnight and bled the next morning from the retro-orbital plexus while under anesthesia. Blood was collected into a tube containing 6 μl of EDTA (0.5 m), separated by centrifugation at 2000 × g for 15 min, and kept at 4 °C until analysis. In an atherogenic food experiment, the positive F1 mice of intact apoAI gene cluster transgenic line 4, mutant transgenic line 4 mice, and nontransgenic littermates had free access to an atherogenic diet (40% basic food, 15% fat, 1.25% cholesterol, 0.5% sodium cholate) or regular mouse chow for 20 weeks, and then plasma lipids were analyzed. Plasma Lipoprotein and Lipid Analysis—The individual lipoprotein fractions (VLDL, d < 1.006 g/ml; IDL + LDL, d = 1.006–1.063 g/ml; HDL, d = 1.063–1.21 g/ml) were isolated from pooled serum of at least six mice of intact transgenic line 4 and six mice of mutant transgenic line 4, respectively. Human and wild-type mouse serum was used as a positive and negative control. Isolation was achieved by sequential ultracentrifugation at the respective densities at 42,000 rpm in a CP 70 MX ultracentrifuge equipped with a P42AT 0313 rotor (Hitachi) for 3, 12, and 16 h at 10 °C. Each lipoprotein fraction was analyzed for human apolipoprotein composition by 3–15% sequential SDS-PAGE. Proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Schleicher & Schuell) followed by incubation with polyclonal goat antibody against human apoAI, apoCIII, apoAIV (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and apoAV (a gift from Dr. Robert O. Ryan and Michael N. Oda), respectively. With regard to apoCIII, the total plasma (5 μl) of transgenic mice was also used for Western blot. The antibodies directed against human apolipoproteins were highly specific and did not show any cross-species reactivity. Rabbit anti-goat IgG (Amersham Biosciences) was used as a secondary antibody. The positive F1 mice of intact transgenic mouse line 4 and mutant line 4 were selected to analyze lipid profile after consumption of atherogenic and chow diets. Triglyceride concentrations were determined by an enzymatic glycerol oxidase-p-aminophenazone method; total and HDL cholesterol concentrations were determined by enzymatic cholesterol oxidase-p-aminophenazone methods with commercial kits (Beijing Zhongsheng High-Tech company, Beijing, People's Republic of China). All analysis was performed on the HITACHI 7060 Automatic Analyzer (Japan). Statistical Analysis—Results are reported as means ± S.E. In all experiments, nontransgenic littermates were used as controls. An unpaired Student's t test was used to compare values in different groups. Statistical significance was defined as p < 0.05. Screening and Identification of BAC 286I4 and Mutant Clone—After SnaBI digestion and pulse field gel electrophoresis of BAC DNA, the approximate sizes of the selected clones were estimated by comparison with size markers of multimers of bacteriophage (New England Biolabs) (data not shown). Clone 286I4 is 116-kb long and contains all of the human apoAI, apoCIII, apoAIV, and apoAV genes. Two terminal sequencing further proved that 286I4 was the fragment from 72491–188971 in the human genomic sequence (GenBank™ accession number AC007707). FISH analysis showed that the hybridization signals were located on human chromosome 11q23. No other signal was detected in the FISH results (Fig. 3). Using temperature-sensitive shuttle vector-mediated homologous recombination, we identified a mutant 286I4 clone. Southern blotting results indicated that a ∼300-bp core sequence (–491/–793 to apoCIII) of the apoCIII enhancer was deleted in the mutant clone (Fig. 2, lane 1). Further sequencing results of the PCR product verified that the core sequence of the apoCIII enhancer was deleted. Creation of Intact Human apoAI/CIIII/AIV/AV Transgenic Mice—Four founder mice were identified by PCR and further verified by Southern blot. They all had the same hybrid bands with the human genomic DNA control (Fig. 4), which confirmed the structural integration of the human apoAI gene cluster. Compared with human genomic DNA, the copy numbers of transgenes in mice lines T1, T2, T3, and T4 were 1, 2, 3, and 2, respectively (Fig. 4). Tissue-specific Expression of apoAI, apoCIII, apoAIV, and apoAV in Intact apoAI Gene Cluster Transgenic Mice—Human apo gene expression in the transgenic mouse lines was determined by RPA. The human apoAI clustered genes were primarily expressed in the liver and intestine of transgenic mice and were hardly detected in the kidney, brain, heart, lung, stomach, spleen, and skeletal muscle (data not shown). Human apoAI is expressed mainly in the liver and to a much lesser extent in the intestine of transgenic mice. Human apoCIII expression was high in the liver and moderate in the intestine. apoAIV is expressed mainly in the intestine and to a lesser extent in the liver. Consistent with previous findings, apoAV expression was detected only in the liver (shown as T1, T2, T3, and T4 in Figs. 5 and 6) (2.Pennacchio L.A. Olivier M. Hubacek J.A. Cohen J.C. Cox D.R. Fruchart J.-C. Krauss R.M. Rubin E.M. Science. 2001; 294: 169-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (788) Google Scholar). The expression pattern of the four apo genes in transgenic mice is similar to that of the human in vivo (2.Pennacchio L.A. Olivier M. Hubacek J.A. Cohen J.C. Cox D.R. Fruchart J.-C. Krauss R.M. Rubin E.M. Science. 2001; 294: 169-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (788) Google Scholar, 16.Zannis V.I. Kan H.Y. Kritis A. Zanni E.E. Kardassis D. Curr. Opin.

Normalized apoAI, apoCIII, apoAIV, and apoAV specific values were plotted against the gene copy number of the transgene for each animal. This indicated that the expression of apoAI clustered genes showed a closer approximation of copy number dependence (Fig. 7).Fig. 7Relationship between gene expression and the copy number of the integrated transgenes in intact apoAI cluster transgenic mice. Human apoAI-, apoCIII-, apoAIV-, and apoAV-specific signals and mouse G3PDH-specific signals in different exposures of the experiment shown as T1–T4 in Figs. 4 and 5 were subjected to densitometric scanning. The resulting values for the apo-specific signals were then normalized against the values for the G3PDH-specific signals, and these arbitrary units were plotted versus the gene copy number of the transgene for each line (n = 5). a, in the liver of transgenic mice. b, in the intestine of transgenic mice.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Creation of Mutant Human apoAI/CIIII/AIV/AV Transgenic Mice—PCR and Southern blot verified that five stable mutant transgenic mouse lines were generated by linear mutant 286I4 BAC DNA microinjection. All mutant transgenic mouse lines had the same hybrid bands as the human genomic DNA control. Compared with human genomic DNA, the copy numbers for each strain of the five founders were 3, 20, 1, 2, and 6, respectively (Fig. 8). Tissue-specific Expression of apoAI, apoCIII, apoAIV, and apoAV in Mutant apoAI Gene Cluster Transgenic Mice—No apoAI clustered gene expression was detected in tissues other than the liver and intestine in mutant transgenic mice (data not shown). Hepatic expression of human apoAI was abolished in mutant transgenic mouse lines 3 and 4 and was reduced significantly in lines 1, 2, and 5. The expression of human apoCIII and apoAIV was also reduced remarkably in the liver of mutant transgenic mice (M1–M5 in Figs. 5, 6, and 9). However, hepatic expression of human apoAV in mutant mice was not different from that in the intact apoAI cluster transgenic mice (Figs. 5, 6, and 9). This suggested that deletion of the apoCIII enhancer did not influence hepatic apoAV expression in the cluster. Plasma Apolipoproteins and Lipids in the Transgenic Mice— The distribution of human apolipoproteins among various lipoprotein classes in the plasma of transgenic mice was analyzed by Western blot. As positive control (human plasma), human apoAI and apoAIV were present mainly in HDL (d = 1.063–1.21 g/ml) particles, and human apoAV was present in HDL and VLDL particles of intact and mutant transgenic mice (Fig. 10a). Human apoCIII was detected in the whole plasma of transgenic mice. All four human apolipoproteins were not detected in the lipoproteins of the negative control, wild-type mice plasma (Fig. 10). Table I presents plasma lipid profiles in the intact human apoAI cluster transgenic mice (line 4), mutant apoAI cluster transgenic mice (line 4), and nontransgenic littermates. Plasma triglyceride levels in the intact apoAI cluster transgenic mice increased ∼3-fold compared with control animals (296 ± 127 versus 81 ± 15, p < 0.05), whereas in the mutant transgenic mice, the level decreased to 70% compared with control mice (57 ± 12 versus 81 ± 15, p < 0.05). Total cholesterol in the intact transgenic mice increased about 60% (141 ± 31 versus 87 ± 14, p < 0.05), mainly due to an increase in the non-HDL subclass, whereas no significant change was observed in mutant transgenic mice compared with control animals (90 ± 15 versus 87 ± 14) (Table. 1).Table ILipid concentration in human apoAI cluster transgenic and control mice fed with atherogenic and chow dietsAnalyteControl miceApoAI cluster Tg miceMutant cluster Tg miceChow diet (n = 12)Atherogenic diet (n = 12)Chow diet (n = 18)Atherogenic diet (n = 12)Chow diet (n = 14)Atherogenic diet (n = 8)mg/dlmg/dlmg/dlmg/dlmg/dlmg/dlTriglyceride81 ± 1561 ± 13ap < 0.05 versus mice fed a chow diet.296 ± 127bp < 0.05 versus control mice fed chow diet.116 ± 58ap < 0.05 versus mice fed a chow diet.57 ± 12bp < 0.05 versus control mice fed chow diet.88 ± 12Total cholesterol87 ± 14125 ± 32ap < 0.05 versus mice fed a chow diet.141 ± 31bp < 0.05 versus control mice fed chow diet.192 ± 84ap < 0.05 versus mice fed a chow diet.90 ± 15141 ± 24ap < 0.05 versus mice fed a chow diet.HDL"
