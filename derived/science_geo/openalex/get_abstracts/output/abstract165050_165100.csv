https://openalex.org/W2159512638,"The vertical distribution of bacteriochlorophyll a , the numbers of infrared fluorescent cells, and the variable fluorescence signal at 880 nanometers wavelength, all indicate that photosynthetically competent anoxygenic phototrophic bacteria are abundant in the upper open ocean and comprise at least 11% of the total microbial community. These organisms are facultative photoheterotrophs, metabolizing organic carbon when available, but are capable of photosynthetic light utilization when organic carbon is scarce. They are globally distributed in the euphotic zone and represent a hitherto unrecognized component of the marine microbial community that appears to be critical to the cycling of both organic and inorganic carbon in the ocean."

https://openalex.org/W2127510556,"Apoptotic cell death following injury of vascular endothelium is assumed to play an important role in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis. In this report, we demonstrate that high density lipoproteins (HDL), a major anti-atherogenic lipoprotein fraction, protect endothelial cells against growth factor deprivation-induced apoptosis. HDL blocked the mitochondrial pathway of apoptosis by inhibiting dissipation of mitochondrial potential (Δψm), generation of reactive oxygen species, and release of cytochrome c into the cytoplasm. As a consequence, HDL prevented activation of caspases 9 and 3 and apoptotic alterations of the plasma membrane such as increase of permeability and translocation of phosphatidylserine. Treatment of endothelial cells with HDL induced activation of the protein kinase Akt, an ubiquitous transducer of anti-apoptotic signals, and led to phosphorylation of BAD, a major Akt substrate. Suppression of Akt activity both by wortmannin and LY-294002 or by a dominant negative Akt mutant abolished the anti-apoptotic effect of HDL. Two bioactive lysosphingolipids present in HDL particles, sphingosylphosphorylcholine and lysosulfatide, fully mimicked the survival effect of HDL by blocking the mitochondrial pathway of apoptosis and potently activating Akt. In conclusion, the present study identifies HDL as a carrier of endogenous endothelial survival factors and suggests that inhibition of endothelial apoptosis by HDL-associated lysosphingolipids may represent an important and novel aspect of the anti-atherogenic activity of HDL.

Endothelial cells in lesion-prone regions are characterized by increased turnover rates, and local apoptosis has been implicated in this process (1Davies P.F. Remuzzi A. Gordon E.J. Dewey Jr., C.F. Gimbrone Jr., M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 2114-2117Crossref PubMed Scopus (694) Google Scholar). Apoptosis of endothelial cells has been observed in regions of atherosclerotic plaques located downstream of blood flow where low shear stress and disturbed hemodynamic flow patterns prevail (2Tricot O. Mallat Z. Heymes C. Belmin J. Leseche G. Tedgui A. Circulation. 2000; 101: 2450-2453Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar). Several studies indicate the involvement of endothelial cell apoptosis in acute coronary syndromes; apoptotic endothelial cells are pro-coagulant and constitute an integral part of highly thrombogenic “shed apoptotic membrane microparticles”, which are found in the blood of patients with acute coronary events (3Mallat Z. Hugel B. Ohan J. Leseche G. Freyssinet J.M. Tedgui A. Circulation. 1999; 99: 348-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (596) Google Scholar, 4Mallat Z. Benamer H. Hugel B. Benessiano J. Steg P.G. Freyssinet J.M. Tedgui A. Circulation. 2000; 101 (841): 841Crossref PubMed Scopus (814) Google Scholar). Several pro-athrogenic factors in plasma were demonstrated to initiate endothelial cell apoptosis in vitro. These include oxidized and minimally oxidized low density lipoproteins, angiotensin II, homocystein, and hyperglycemia (5Kinscherf R. Claus R. Wagner M. Gehrke C. Kamencic H. Hou D. Nauen O.

Diabetes. 1995; 44: 1323-1331Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). Furthermore, endothelial cell apoptosis can be triggered by reactive oxygen species (ROS),1 which are abundantly produced by several cell types found in atherosclerotic lesions (9Irani K. Circ. Res. 2000; 4: 179-183Crossref Scopus (686) Google Scholar). Much less, however, is known about the ability of endogenous anti-atherogenic factors to prevent endothelial cell apoptosis. Laminar shear stress and nitric oxide have been shown to suppress endothelial apoptosis triggered by various stimuli (7Dimmeler S. Rippmann V. Weiland U. Haendeler J. Zeiher A.M. Circ. Res. 1997; 81: 970-976Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar, 10Dimmeler S. Assmus B. Hermann C. Haendeler J. Zeicher A.M. Circ.

Anti-atherogenic hormones such as oestrogens or insulin were also observed to protect endothelial cells against apoptosis (12Spyridopoulos I. Sullivan A.B. Kearney M. Isner J.M. Losordo D.W. Circulation. 1997; 95: 1505-1508Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar, 13Hermann C. Assmaus B. Urbich C. Zeicher A.M. Dimmeler S. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2000; 20: 402-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Although high density lipoproteins (HDL) are regarded as one of the most potent anti-atherogenic factors, little is known about their effect on endothelial cell survival and susceptibility to apoptosis. In the present study, we demonstrate that HDL potently protect endothelial cells against growth factor deprivation-induced apoptosis via suppression of the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway. We characterize the serine/threonine kinase Akt as a mediator of the anti-apoptotic effect of HDL and identify molecular entities in HDL particles responsible for their protective effects in endothelial cells. Antibodies to caspase-3, caspase-9, and cytochrome c were from PharMingen, San Diego, CA. Antibody to VDAC (voltage-dependent anion channel) was purchased by Calbiochem, Bad Nauheim, Germany. Anti-phospho-Akt and anti-phospho-BAD were from New England Biolabs, Schwalbach, Germany. YO-PRO, C2938 (6-carboxy-2′, 7′ dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate), and DiOC6 (3,3′-dihexyloxacarbocyanine iodide) were from Molecular Probes, Port Gebouw, The Netherlands. All other chemicals were from Sigma. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) were purchased from PromoCell, Heidelberg, Germany, and maintained in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with fetal bovine serum (20%, v/v), human basic fibroblast growth factor, hydrocortisone, porcine heparin, and endothelial cell growth supplement as recommended by the supplier. Growth factor deprivation was induced by changing the media to RPMI 1640 without supplements. HDL (d = 1.125–1.210 g/ml) and LDL (d = 1.019–1.250 g/ml) were isolated from human plasma as described by Havel et al. (14Havel R.J. Eder H. Bragdon J.H. J. Clin. Invest. 1955; 3: 1345-1353Crossref Scopus (6487) Google Scholar). LDL was oxidized with CuSO4 as described previously (15Jankowski J. Nofer J.-R. Tepel M. Griewel B. Schlüter H. Assmann G. Zidek W. Clin. Sci. 1998; 95: 489-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Lipid-free apoA-I and apoA-II were isolated by reversed phase HPLC (16von Eckardstein A. Funke H. Walter M. Altland K. Benninghoven A. Assmann G. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 8610-8617Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To obtain lipid and protein fractions, 0.1 ml of native HDL (10 g/L) was diluted with 0.9 ml water, adjusted to pH 3.0 with sulfuric acid, and subsequently mixed with 1.0 ml acetonitrile. After addition of 0.5 g NaCl, the sample was centrifuged (5 min, 800 ×g). The upper organic phase arbitrarily called HDL lipid fraction was dried, dissolved in ethanol, and rapidly injected into phosphate-buffered saline while vortexing. The lower aqueous phase containing apoproteins was arbitrarily called HDL protein fraction, collected, and lyophilized. Both fractions were used for cell stimulation in amounts indexed to original HDL concentration. To characterize sphingosylphosphorylcholine (SPC) and lysosulfatide (LSF) contents in HDL and LDL, HPLC analysis of the lipid fractions obtained from each lipoprotein was performed on a Kontron (Neufahrn, Germany) liquid chromatograph with two Model 422 pumps and a Model 440 diode array detector. 0.03 ml of the HDL sample was introduced onto a column using a Rheodyne 7125 loop injector (Cotati, CA). The separation was carried out on a 5 μm Nucleosil 100-Si column (25 cm × 4 mm ID) (Macherey-Nagel, Düren, Germany), with a flow rate of 1.0 ml/min at an ambient temperature. Mobile phase component A was acetonitrile and component B was acetonitrile/water (80:20, v/v). The following gradient was used: 0 min 100% A; 45 min 10% A; 47 min 10% A; 48 min 100% A; 55 min end of run. Phospholipids were detected by UV absorption at 193 nm. Floating endothelial cells were collected by centrifugation. Adherent cells were collected by trypsinization. For determination of the annexin V binding, combined cell populations (5 × 105/ml) were resuspended in 140 mmol/liter NaCl, 10 mmol/liter Hepes, and 2.5 mmol/L CaCl2. Annexin V-FITC (Bender Med-Systems Diagnostics, Vienna, Austria) was added for 30 min at room temperature according to the supplier's instruction. For determination of the cell membrane permeability, endothelial cells (5 × 105/ml) were incubated for 30 min in phosphate-buffered saline with YO-PRO-1 at a final concentration of 0.1 μmol/liter. Flow cytometric measurements of annexin V binding and YO-PRO-1 staining were performed on a Coulter Epics Elite flow cytometer equipped with a 15-milliwatt argon ion laser (Coulter Corporation, Hialeah, FL) (excitation wavelength: 488 nm; fluorescence emission: 525 nm; data rate: ∼300 cells/s). Endothelial cells were resuspended in hypotonic cell lyses buffer (25 mmol/liter Hepes, 5 mmol/liter MgCl2, 5 mmol/liter EDTA, 5 mmol/liter dithiothreitol, Complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany)), subjected to four freeze/thaw cycles, and centrifuged. Caspase-3 and -9 activities were measured in the supernatant according to the protocol of the CaspACE Fluorimetric Assay System (Promega, Mannheim, Germany). Ac-DEVD-AMD (excitation wavelength: 360 nm, emission wavelength: 460 nm) and Ac-LEHD-AFC (excitation wavelength: 400 nm, emission wavelength: 505 nm) were used as substrates for caspase-3 and -9, respectively. Fluorescence was determined using a PerkinElmer Life Sciences LS70 fluorimeter. Data were expressed as picomoles of the fluorescence substrate AMC or AFC liberated per minute and μg protein. Determination of ROS production and ΔΨmwas performed as described by Quillet-Mary et al. (17Quillet-Mary M. Jaffrezou J.P. Mansat V. Bordier C. Naval J. Laurent G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21388-21395Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar). Briefly, production of ROS was detected with the fluorescent probe C2938. After labeling with 0.5 μmol/liter C2936 for 1 h floating and adherent cells were collected and washed twice, and fluorescence was determined using a PerkinElmer Life Sciences LS70 fluorimeter (excitation wavelength: 510 nm, emission wavelength: 534 nm). To evaluate ΔΨm cells were labeled with 40 nmDiOC6 and washed twice, and the fluorescence of the suspension was determined (excitation wavelength: 488 nm, emission wavelength: 500 nm). Cells were washed with cold phosphate-buffered saline, scraped, and centrifuged, and the cell pellet was resuspended in 20 mmHepes-KOH, pH 7.5, 10 mm KCl, 1.5 mmMgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 250 mm sucrose, 100 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml leupeptin and 1 μg/ml aprotinin. Subcellular fractionation was performed as described (18Poppe M. Reimertz C. Düβmann H. Krohn A.J. Luetjens C.M. Böckelmann D. Nieminen A.-L. Kögel D. Prehn J.H.M. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 4551-4563Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were homogenized using a glass Dounce (10 strokes) and were centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. The particulate represented the mitochondria-containing nuclear-heavy membrane fraction. The supernatant was centrifuged for 15 min at 20,000 × g at 4 °C. This second supernatant represented the cytosol (including the light membrane fraction). HUVEC were lyzed in 0.18 mol/liter Tris-HCl, 0.15 mol/liter NaCl, 10% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 5% (v/v) sodium deoxycholate, 1% (v/v) SDS, 50 mmol/liter NaF, 1 mmol/liter EGTA, 1 mmol/liter orthovanadate, and the Complete protease inhibitor mixture. Cell lysates (50 μg/lane) were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Thereafter proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, which were blocked overnight in Tris-buffered saline containing 5% non-fat dry milk prior to incubations with antibodies. Loading controls were performed using an antibody against a ubiquitously expressed protein (α-actin). HUVEC were transfected with 11 μg dnAkt (c-myc-tagged dominant negative Akt1 (K179M) in pUSEamp, Upstate Biotechnology) and a control vector, respectively, using lipid pF7 (Invitrogen) in Optimem (Life Technologies, Inc.) as described earlier (19Levkau B. Koyama H. Raines E.W. Clurman B.E. Herren B. Orth K. Roberts J.M. Ross R. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 553-563Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar, 20Levkau B. Scatena M. Giachelli C.M. Ross R. Raines E.W. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 227-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). After 24 h of recovery by culture in complete growth medium, cells transfected with control vector or dnAkt were exposed to growth factor (GF) deprivation in the presence of 1.0 g/liter HDL for 24 h. Floating apoptotic and adherent survived cells were collected and fixed in 3.7% (w/v) paraformaldehyde. Separate analysis of c-myc-positive cells (apoptotic and surviving) in both transfected cell populations (vector control and dnAkt) was performed by fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis using a primary anti-c-myc-antibody (Upstate Biotechnology) and a secondary fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled anti-mouse antibody. Apoptosis was calculated as percent c-myc-positive apoptotic cells from all c-myc-positive cells in vector control and dnAkt-transfected cell populations. HUVEC undergo apoptosis when deprived of GF (19Levkau B. Koyama H. Raines E.W. Clurman B.E. Herren B. Orth K. Roberts J.M. Ross R. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 553-563Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar, 20Levkau B. Scatena M. Giachelli C.M. Ross R. Raines E.W. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 227-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Some of the early molecular events in apoptosis include alterations of the plasma membrane properties such as translocation of phosphatidylserine from the endofacial to the exofacial leaflet and increased permeability. To test the effect of HDL on endothelial cell apoptosis in our system, we exposed HUVEC to GF deprivation in the presence or absence of HDL and quantified phosphatidylserine-positive cells using annexin V staining as a measure of apoptosis. GF deprivation led to a significant increase of annexin V-positive cells over time, which was consistently inhibited by 40–50% in the presence of 1.0 g/liter HDL at any time point measured (Fig. 1 A). The time-dependent increase of apoptosis-associated membrane permeability measured with the dye YO-PRO-1 was also substantially inhibited by 1.0 g/liter HDL (Fig. 1 B). The blocking effect of HDL on endothelial apoptosis was concentration-dependent, with a maximal suppression at 0.5–1.0 g/liter HDL (Fig. 1 C). After undergoing apoptosis, HUVEC detach from the substratum and appear in the supernatant as apoptotic “floaters” (20Levkau B. Scatena M. Giachelli C.M. Ross R. Raines E.W. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 227-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). HDL suppressed the number of these apoptotic floaters in the conditioned medium in a concentration-dependent manner as well, with an ∼50–60% inhibition of apoptosis at 1.0 g/liter HDL (Fig. 1 D). The execution of the apoptotic program requires the activation of the caspase family of cystein proteases, which disassemble cells through the selective proteolysis of key protein substrates. One of the principal mechanisms of caspase activation requires the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria, which together with Apaf-1 and dATP/ATP form the “apoptosome”, the complex that recruits and activates the “initiator” caspase-9. In turn, caspase-9 recruits, cleaves, and activates “effector” caspases such as caspase-3 (21Loeffler M. Kroemer G. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 256: 19-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). Therefore, we examined the effect of HDL on the activation of caspase-9 and caspase-3 by measuring cleavage of their fluorogenic substrates, Ac-LEHD-AFC and Ac-DEVD-AMC, respectively. HDL dramatically suppressed the activity of both caspase-9 and caspase-3 measured 8 h after withdrawal of GF in a concentration-dependent manner with an ∼75% inhibition at a concentration of 1.0 g/liter (Fig.2 A). As a biochemical marker for caspase activation we also determined the effect of HDL on the proteolytic processing of pro-caspases-3 and -9, which is required for the full caspase activity. 1.0 g/liter HDL almost completely abolished the generation of the active 23 kDa caspase-3 subunit and markedly reduced the generation of the active 37 kDa caspase-9 subunit after GF deprivation (Fig. 2 B). To elucidate the impact of HDL on the molecular pathways upstream of caspase activation, we tested the effect of HDL on the dissipation of the Δψm and the generation of ROS, which are associated with the release of cytochrome c into the cytoplasm. After GF deprivation of HUVEC for 8 h a marked decrease of Δψm from 620 ± 162 to 78 ± 17 (n = 3) was observed. This Δψm collapse was reverted in the presence of increasing concentrations of HDL (Fig.2 C). Because Δψm dissipation leads to production of ROS at the ubiquinone site of the respiratory chain, we also investigated ROS generation during endothelial apoptosis. Withdrawal of GFs for 8 h increased ROS levels from 18.2 ± 4.1 (n = 5) to 62.3 ± 8.5 (n = 5), which was inhibited by HDL in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 2 D). These protective effects of HDL on the mitochondrium were associated with the inhibition of mitochondrial cytochrome c release into the cytoplasm, the initial step for the activation of caspases (Fig. 2 E); while cytoplasmic cytochrome c levels gradually increased over time after GF deprivation in the absence of HDL, addition of 1.0 g/liter HDL to the culture medium substantially reduced cytochrome c levels released into the cytoplasm. As expected, the release of cytochromec into the cytoplasm was accompanied by a decrease in the cytochrome c content in mitochondria, which occurred between 2 and 8 h after GF withdrawal. No such decrease was observed in endothelial cells preincubated with 1.0 g/L HDL at this time. To investigate the specificity of cytochrome c release during apoptosis we examined the effect of GF deprivation on VDAC, a membrane channel expressed in the mitochondrium as described previously (18Poppe M. Reimertz C. Düβmann H. Krohn A.J. Luetjens C.M. Böckelmann D. Nieminen A.-L. Kögel D. Prehn J.H.M. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 4551-4563Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2 E, no VDAC could be detected in the cytoplasmic fraction of endothelial cells either in the presence or absence of HDL, thus excluding contamination of the cytosolic fraction with mitochondria. The protein kinase Akt was identified as an important survival factor that suppresses the mitochondrial pathway of apoptosis in a number of experimental systems (22Datta S.R. Brunet A. Greenberg M.E. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2905-2927Crossref PubMed Scopus (3721) Google Scholar). To assess the involvement of Akt in the HDL-mediated inhibition of endothelial apoptosis, we used wortmannin and LY-294002, two selective and structurally unrelated inhibitors of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3-K), an upstream activator of Akt. Both wortmannin and LY-294002 reverted the inhibitory effect of HDL on caspase-3 activation and annexin-V binding during GF deprivation-induced apoptosis in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 3 A). 100 nm wortmannin and 10 μmol/liter LY-294002 completely abrogated the anti-apoptotic effects of HDL. The protein kinase Akt is activated by binding of PI3-K-phosphorylated phospholipids and by direct phosphorylation at threonine 308 and serine 473. To determine whether HDL regulate the activity of Akt in endothelial cells, we analyzed whole-cell lysates of HDL-treated HUVEC for Akt activation using a phosphospecific antibody to serine 473 of Akt. In time-course experiments, we found Akt to be activated 5–10 min after exposure to HDL (Fig. 3, B and C). This response gradually decreased after prolonged incubation. Densitometric analysis of signals revealed a maximal 3.4 ± 0.3-fold (n = 3) stimulation by HDL at 1,0 g/liter (Fig.3 C). In addition, HDL induced a time-dependent phosphorylation of BAD, a major substrate of Akt, at serine 136 (Fig.3 B). The maximal 4.2 ± 1.3-fold (n = 2) increase of BAD phosphorylation occurred 30 min after exposure to HDL and decreased thereafter (Fig. 3 D). To test the involvement of PI3-K in the activation of Akt in response to HDL, we pretreated cells with 100 nmol/liter wortmannin or 10 μmol/liter LY-294002. Both inhibitors completely abolished the phosphorylation of Akt (Fig. 3 E). To examine whether Akt is directly responsible for the survival effect of HDL, we transfected HUVEC with a c-myc-tagged catalytically inactive Akt mutant, which acts in a dominant negative fashion to suppress the activity of endogenous Akt. We then exposed the transfected HUVEC to GF deprivation in the presence of HDL and determined the percentage of apoptotic cells carrying the c-myc-tagged dominant negative Akt compared with vector controls using fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled anti-c-mycantibodies and flow cytometry. We observed that almost twice as many endothelial cells expressing dominant negative Akt underwent apoptosis in the presence of HDL as control-transfected cells (Fig.3 F). This experiment documents that HDL mediate survival in endothelial cells via activation of Akt. To determine specificity of the apoptosis-suppressing effect of HDL we compared it with native and oxidized LDL. As shown in Fig.4, native LDL exerted no significant inhibitory effects on annexin V binding or caspase-3 activity at physiological concentrations (0.5 g/liter). Similarly, oxidized LDL had no effect on the above parameters of apoptosis during the time monitored (8 h). At longer incubation times (24–48 h) oxidized LDL initiated apoptosis as expected and previously published (5, 6; and data not shown). HDL are complex molecules containing several biologically active proteins and lipids. To determine HDL entities responsible for the inhibition of endothelial apoptosis, we tested different components of HDL for their anti-apoptotic potential. We observed no effect of the HDL protein fraction (0, 8 g/liter), purified apoA-I (0, 25 g/liter), or purified apoA-II (0, 25 g/liter) on annexin V binding or caspase-3 activity after induction of apoptosis (Fig.4 A). In contrast, the HDL lipid fraction exerted a potent anti-apoptotic effect in our system (Fig. 4 A). Recently, we demonstrated that HDL serve as a carrier for bioactive lysosphingolipids, such as SPC and LSF (23Nofer J.-R. Fobker M. Höbbel G. Voss R. Wolinska I. Tepel M. Zidek W. Junker R. Seedorf U. von Eckardstein A. Assmann G. Walter M. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 15199-15207Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The content of SPC and LSF in HDL used in the present study was 1.24 ± 0.53 μg/mg (n = 5) and 4.71 ± 1.12 μg/mg (n = 5), respectively. As shown in Fig. 4 B, these two substances are abundantly present in HDL and to much lesser extent in LDL as characterized by HPLC. Therefore, we tested the effect of these two substances on endothelial apoptosis. Both SPC and LSF inhibited the increase of annexin V binding and cell permeability to YO-PRO-1 after GF deprivation in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 4 C). Moreover, caspase-3 and caspase-9 activities after induction of apoptosis were dose-dependently reduced in the presence of SPC and LSF (Fig. 4 D). The maximal inhibitory effect of both compounds on apoptosis and caspase activation was observed in concentrations close to those present in HDL particles in serum. Finally, both SPC and LSF induced a time-dependent Akt phosphorylation in endothelial cells with similar kinetics to those of HDL (Fig.4 E). Hence, SPC and LSF represent HDL entities responsible for the inhibition of HUVEC apoptosis by HDL. Low HDL cholesterol levels are one of the most predictive coronary risk factors (24Gordon T. Rifkind B.M. N. Engl. J. Med. 1989; 321: 1311-1315Crossref PubMed Scopus (1411) Google Scholar, 25Assmann G. Schulte H. Am. J. Cardiol. 1992; 70: 733-772Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (833) Google Scholar). The negative correlation between coronary heart disease and plasma HDL cholesterol has been attributed to the ability of HDL to take up excess cellular cholesterol from the periphery and transport it to the liver, a process termed reverse cholesterol transport (26von Eckardstein A. Nofer J.-R. Assmann G. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2001; 21: 13-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (646) Google Scholar). In addition, several other activities exerted by HDL such as inhibition of monocyte adhesion to endothelial cells, inhibition of platelet activation, or inhibition of LDL oxidation are potentially anti-atherogenic (27Stein O. Stein Y. Atherosclerosis. 1999; 144: 285-303Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). In this study, we demonstrate that in contrast to native and oxidized LDL HDL potently promote endothelial cell survival and protect against apoptosis. HDL suppress the mitochondrial pathway of apoptosis by preserving mitochondrial integrity and thus inhibiting cytochrome c release as well as the subsequent activation of the caspase cascade. As a mediator of the anti-apoptotic effect of HDL upstream of the mitochondrium we identify the protein kinase Akt, an important survival factor in a number of experimental systems. We demonstrate that HDL activate Akt via a PI3-K-dependent pathway similarly to growth factors such as insulin (14Havel R.J. Eder H. Bragdon J.H. J. Clin. Invest. 1955; 3: 1345-1353Crossref Scopus (6487) Google Scholar), vascular endothelial growth factor (28Fujio Y. Walsh K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16349-16354Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar), and angiopoetin-1 (29Papapetropoulos A. Fulton D. Mahboubi K. Kalb R.G. O'Connor D.S. Li F. Altieri C. Sessa W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9102-9105Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (549) Google Scholar) because the inhibitors of this pathway, wortmannin and LY-294002, abolished HDL-mediated Akt activation. Furthermore, both inhibitors as well as overexpression of dominant negative Akt were found to block the anti-apoptotic activity of HDL in endothelial cells. These findings constitute the direct demonstration that the PI3-K/Akt pathway mediates the anti-apoptotic biological activity of HDL. Although cytoprotective effects of HDL against cell death induced by oxLDL (30Suc I. Escargueil-Blanc I. Troly M. Salvayre R. Negre-Salvayre A. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1997; 17: 2158-2166Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar) or TNF-α (31Sugano M. Tsuchida K. Makino N. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 272: 872-876Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar) were reported previously, neither the role of mitochondrial apoptosis nor the involvement of Akt were tested, and extremely long incubation times (>20 h) were necessary to demonstrate a protective effect, much in contrast to the HDL-mediated protection already visible 3 h after induction of apoptosis in our system. Moreover, the cytoprotective effects of HDL against oxLDL and TNF-α have been found to be partially mimicked by free apolipoprotein A-I, whereas none of the HDL apoproteins examined in this study had a protective effect in our system. These differences may be due to the different apoptotic stimuli used or may reflect the complexity of HDL-induced intracellular signaling, which we and others have previously shown to involve several independent pathways (32Walter M. Reinecke H. Nofer J.-R. Seedorf U. Assmann G. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1995; 15: 1975-1986Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 33Deeg M.A. Bowen R.F. Oram J.F. Bierman E.D. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1997; 17: 1667-1674Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Several downstream targets of Akt may account for the anti-apoptotic effect of HDL. We show that HDL induce phosphorylation of the pro-apoptotic protein BAD, an important substrate of Akt. This phosphorylation is known to promote the association of BAD with 14–3-3 proteins and its dissociation from BCL-XL, which is then free to suppress mitochondrial apoptosis. Because in this study HDL was found to inhibit mitochondrial apoptosis, it is possible that the anti-apoptotic effect of HDL is associated with the phosphorylation of BAD. In addition, HDL inhibited the activity of caspase-9, which is another negatively regulated direct substrate of Akt (22Datta S.R. Brunet A. Greenberg M.E. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2905-2927Crossref PubMed Scopus (3721) Google Scholar). Recent studies suggest that in some cell systems Akt controls cell survival via regulation of the transcription factor NF-κB (34Romashkova J.A. Makarov S.S. Nature. 1999; 401: 86-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (1667) Google Scholar, 35Ozes O.N. Mayo L.D. Gustin J.A. Pfeffer S.R. Pfeffer L.M. Donner D.B. Nature. 1999; 401: 82-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (1898) Google Scholar). However, because HDL neither induce the translocation of NF-κB to the nucleus nor the binding of NF-κB to specific DNA sequences (36Cockerill G.W. Saklatvala J. Ridley S.H. Yarwood H. Miller N.E. Oral B. Nithyanathan S. Taylor G. Haskard D.O. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1999; 19: 910-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar), it is unlikely that this pathway contributes to the anti-apoptotic effect of HDL. Finally, Akt stimulation may enhance endothelial NO synthesis and promote endothelial cell survival by inhibiting caspases via nitrosylation (37Dimmeler S. Fisslthaler B. Fleming I. Hermann C. Buse R. Zeiher A.M. Nature. 1999; 399: 601-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (3047) Google Scholar). In this context, it is of interest that HDL counteract inhibitory effects of oxidized LDL on NO production in endothelial cells (38Uittenbogaard A. Shaul P.W. Yuhanna I.S. Blair A. Smart E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11278-11283Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). HDL are complex molecules known to induce a multitude of intracellular signals, for which different components of HDL have been made responsible. We previously demonstrated that free apolipoproteins A-I and A-II are responsible for the HDL-mediated activation of phosphatidylcholine-specific phospholipase D but not for the activation of phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C (32Walter M. Reinecke H. Nofer J.-R. Seedorf U. Assmann G. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1995; 15: 1975-1986Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Furthermore, neither apoA-I nor apoA-II could substitute for the intact HDL particle in mobilizing intracellular calcium in fibroblasts and endothelial cells (23Nofer J.-R. Fobker M. Höbbel G. Voss R. Wolinska I. Tepel M. Zidek W. Junker R. Seedorf U. von Eckardstein A. Assmann G. Walter M. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 15199-15207Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 39Honda H.M. Wakamatsu B.K. Goldhaber J.I. Berliner J.A. Navab M. Weiss J.N. Atherosclerosis. 1999; 143: 299-306Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). In contrast, we showed that both phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C activation, Ca2+ mobilization, and cell proliferation in response to HDL can be mimicked by two lysosphingolipids associated with native HDL, namely SPC and LSF (23Nofer J.-R. Fobker M. Höbbel G. Voss R. Wolinska I. Tepel M. Zidek W. Junker R. Seedorf U. von Eckardstein A. Assmann G. Walter M. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 15199-15207Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The present study extends the unique biological activities of SPC and LSF to the ability to mediate the anti-apoptotic effect of HDL. Both substances inhibited activation of caspases and biochemical features of apoptosis in endothelial cells. In addition, SPC and LSF potently stimulated Akt in concentrations similar to those physiologically present in HDL particles in serum. In contrast, neither free apoproteins nor the protein fraction isolated from HDL had any effect. As ∼93 and 72% of the total SPC and LSF plasma levels, respectively, are present in HDL 2M. Fobker and J.-R. Nofer, unpublished data. , these lipoproteins serve as the primary physiological carrier of the two bioactive lysosphingolipids. Consequently, no significant anti-apoptotic effect was observed with other lipoproteins such as LDL. The intracellular signaling events initiated by SPC and LSF were the focus of several recent studies. In addition to their ability to induce phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C activation and Ca2+ mobilization, SPC has been shown to activate both mitogen-activated protein kinases (Erk-1 and Erk-2) and protein kinase C in several cell lines (40Okajima F. Kondo Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26332-26340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 41Chin T.-Y. Chueh S.-H. Am. J.

To our knowledge, SPC-induced activation of Akt and its anti-apoptotic activity has been not reported to date. However, sphingosine-1-phosphate, a compound structurally closely related to SPC was recently demonstrated to promote endothelial cell viability, although no signaling pathway has been identified (43Hisano N. Yatomi Y. Satoh K. Blood. 1999; 93: 4293-4299Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Both SPC and sphingosine-1-phosphate interact with the same receptor termed endothelial differentiation gene 3 (EDG-3) (44Okamoto H. Takuwa N. Yatomi Y. Gonda K. Shigematsu H. Takuwa Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 260: 203-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Due to their lipophilicity, SPC and LSF were suggested to act primarily in an autocrine fashion, but their physiological function has been unknown. The present study identifies SPC and LSF as endogenous plasma-derived anti-apoptotic factors, and reveals that the endothelium may constitute an important physiologic target for LSF and SPC delivered by HDL. Therefore, maintenance of endothelial cell integrity and protection against potentially deleterious pro-atherogenic stimuli may constitute a new biological function of HDL and thus may define a new mechanism that contributes to their atheroprotective function.

This view is highlighted by the fact that no known female organism within the Metazoa exists exclusively (or even for a prolonged period) in a haploid state. We used fluorescence microscopy and variation at nine microsatellite loci to show that the false spider mite, Brevipalpus phoenicis, consists of haploid female parthenogens. We show that this reproductive anomaly is caused by infection by an undescribed endosymbiotic bacterium, which results in feminization of haploid genetic males."

https://openalex.org/W1976272679,"Glutamate is the major excitatory neurotransmitter in the mammalian central nervous system. Packaging and storage of glutamate into glutamatergic neuronal vesicles requires ATP-dependent vesicular glutamate uptake systems, which utilize the electrochemical proton gradient as a driving force.

In addition, VGLUT2 activity is dependent on both membrane potential and pH gradient of the electrochemical proton gradient, whereas VGLUT1 is primarily dependent on only membrane potential.

Two types of neurotransmitter transporters have been identified based on membrane localization on plasma membrane or vesicular membrane. Removal of the transmitter from the synaptic cleft results in termination of the signal, and this requires destruction of transmitter or reuptake of transmitter back to the presynaptic terminal or glial cells via a sodium-dependent uptake system on the plasma membrane (1Masson J. Sagne C. Hamon M. Mestikaway S.E. Pharmacol. Rev. 1999; 51: 439-464PubMed Google Scholar). Packaging and storage of neurotransmitters into specialized secretory vesicles in neurons ensures their regulated release. This storage is also crucial for protecting the neurotransmmitter molecules from leakage or intraneuronal metabolism and for protecting the neuron from possible toxic effects. This process is mediated by specific transporters on the vesicular membranes. At least four different types of vesicular transporters have been functionally identified that are specific for transport of classic neurotransmitters: monoamines, acetylcholine, γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA), and glutamate (2Fykse E.M. Fonnum F. Neurochemical Res. 1996; 21: 1053-1060Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 3Reimer R.J. Fon E.A. Edwards R.H. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1998; 8: 405-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Unlike the plasma membrane transporters, which rely on a sodium gradient across the plasma membrane, all of these vesicular transport processes depend on the proton electrochemical gradient (ΔμH+)1generated by a Mg2+-activated vacuolar H+-ATPase (V-ATPase) on the vesicular membrane (4Forgac M. J. Exp. Biol. 2000; 203: 71-80Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). When protons are pumped into the vesicular lumen, a proton gradient (ΔpH) and a membrane potential (Δψ) occur across the membrane to form ΔμH+, which favors the exchange of luminal protons for cytoplasmic transmitter. The transport of monoamines and acetylcholine rely predominantly on ΔpH (5Knoth J. Zallakian M. Njus D. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 6625-6629Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 6Anderson D.C. King S.C. Parsons S.M. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 3037-3043Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), whereas the accumulation of GABA depends on both Δψ and ΔpH (7Kish P.E. Fischer-Bovenkerk C. Ueda T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 3877-3881Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 8Hell J.W. Maycox P.R. Jahn R. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 2111-2117Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the case of glutamate, there is disagreement over whether the transport of glutamate is driven by Δψ only (9Maycox P.R. Deckwerth T. Hell J.W. Jahn R. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 15423-15428Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Cidon S. Sihra T. J. Biol.

Biochem. 1990; 108: 689-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) or by both Δψ and ΔpH components of ΔμH+ (12Naito S. Ueda T. J. Neurochem. 1985; 44: 99-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar, 13Tabb J.S. Kish P.E. Van Dyke R. Ueda T. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 15412-15418Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition to the differences in driving force, kinetic properties, substrate specificity, and ion dependence also clearly distinguish vesicular glutamate transport from high affinity plasma membrane glutamate transport. The vesicular ATP-dependent glutamate transporter is specific for glutamate, is stimulated by millimolar concentrations of chloride, and has a low affinity for uptake (Km about 1–2 mm) (12Naito S. Ueda T. J. Neurochem. 1985; 44: 99-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar, 14Kish P.E. Ueda T. Methods Enzymol. 1989; 174: 9-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). These functional characteristics are in contrast to those of the plasma membrane glutamate transporter, which is sodium dependent, accepts aspartate as well as glutamate, and has a high affinity for glutamate with Km in the 3–20 μm range (15Kanner B.I. Sharon I. Biochemistry. 1978; 17: 3949-3953Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar,16Logan W.J. Synder S.H. Brain Res. 1972; 42: 413-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). Although vesicular transporters for other neurotransmitters have been intensively studied at mechanistic, biochemical, and molecular levels, molecular cloning of vesicular glutamate transporters has only occurred recently. BNPI, a brain-specific sodium-dependent phosphate cotransporter originally characterized as a plasma membrane transporter, was recently localized on vesicular membranes of small synaptic vesicles in neurons (17Bellocchio E.E. Hu H. Pohorille A. Chan J. Pickel V.M. Edwards R.H. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 8648-8659Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Takmori S. Rhee J.S. Rosenmund C. Jahn R. Nature. 2000; 407: 189-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (712) Google Scholar) and further functionally characterized as a vesicular glutamate transporter called VGLUT1 (18Takmori S. Rhee J.S. Rosenmund C. Jahn R. Nature. 2000; 407: 189-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (712) Google Scholar,19Bellocchio E.E. Reimer R.J. Fremeau Jr., R.T. Edwards R.H. Science. 2000; 289: 957-960Crossref PubMed Scopus (666) Google Scholar). Uptake of glutamate by VGLUT1 has all of the functional characteristics previously reported for vesicular glutamate transporter with Δψ as the predominant driving force. However, only a subset of glutamatergic neurons expresses VGLUT1 (17Bellocchio E.E. Hu H. Pohorille A. Chan J. Pickel V.M. Edwards R.H. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 8648-8659Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 20Ni B. Wu X. Yan G.M. Wang J. Paul S.M. J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 5789-5799Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, inCaenorhabditis elegans, loss-of-function mutations in the VGLUT1 orthologue eat-4, lead to impairment but not to a complete loss of glutamate-mediated neurotransmission (21Raizen D.M. Avery L. Neuron. 1994; 12: 483-495Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 22Lee R.Y. Sawin E.R. Chalfie M. Horvitz H.R. Avery L. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 159-167Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These findings imply that an additional vesicular glutamate transporter(s) may exist. To identify new vesicular glutamate transporter isoforms, we searched the GenbankTM Expressed Sequence Tags (EST) data base using human and rat VGLUT1 sequences (23Ni B. Du Y. Wu X. DeHoff B.S. Rosteck Jr., P.R. Paul S.M. J. Neurochem. 1996; 66: 2227-2238Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 24Ni B. Roseteck P.R. Nadi N.S. Paul S.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 5607-5611Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar), and we found a mouse EST clone, which has ∼49% homology with human and rat VGLUT1. We report here the molecular cloning and functional characterization of VGLUT2, the second identified vesicular glutamate transporter with different transport characteristics and cellular localization as compared with VGLUT1. N,N′-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCCD) was purchased from Fisher Scientific. All other chemicals were obtained from Sigma. The human and rat VGLUT1 sequences were used to search the GenBankTM EST data base. One query gene (GenBankTM number AI 841371) was identified from the mouse EST data base that has ∼49% nucleotide identity with human and rat VGLUT1. This EST clone was obtained from Research Genetics (Huntsville, AL) and sequenced. The sequence was assembled and analyzed, and sequence comparisons were run using Omega software (version 1.1.3) and GenBankTM BLAST searches. The full-length cDNA insert was excised with EcoRI andNotI and subcloned into the same sites of the pSPORT1 vector (Lifetech) and further subcloned into the pIRES2-EGFP vector (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA) at EcoRI andBamHI sites, resulting in VGLUT2-pIRES2-EGFP (the name VGLUT2 was given after the determination of transport characteristics). A rat pheochromocytoma cell line, PC12 cell (ATCC), which was used to characterize glutamate transport by VGLUT1 (19Bellocchio E.E. Reimer R.J. Fremeau Jr., R.T. Edwards R.H. Science. 2000; 289: 957-960Crossref PubMed Scopus (666) Google Scholar), was cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's F-12 medium, supplemented with 20% fetal bovine serum, and 1% penicillin and streptomycin. VGLUT2-pIRES2-EGFP or pIRES2-EGFP without a cDNA insert (10 μg) was transfected into cells by the lipofection method (25Bai L. Collins J.F. Xu H. Ghishan F.K. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: R1112-1119PubMed Google Scholar). Transfected cells were selected with 800 μg/ml G418, and the most highly expressing cells were identified by fluorescence microscopy and selected for further analysis. Stably transfected cells were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and homogenized in 0.32m sucrose and 10 mm HEPES-KOH (pH 7.4) containing protease inhibitors. The resulting homogenate was pelleted at 1000 × g for 5 min to remove nuclei and at 27,000 × g for 35 min to remove heavier membranes. The supernatant containing lighter membranes, including synaptic-like microvesicles, was sedimented at 210,000 × g for 1 h, and the pellet was resuspended in 0.32 m sucrose, 4 mm MgSO4, and 10 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.4 (uptake buffer) at a final concentration of 10 mg of protein/ml. Plasma membranes were prepared as previously described (26Bai L. Fushimi K. Sasaki S. Marumo F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5171-5176Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) and were also resuspended in uptake buffer at 10 mg protein/ml. To start the transport assay, 100 μg of vesicular membrane or plasma membrane proteins in uptake buffer were mixed with 4 mmATP, 4 mm KCl, and 50 μml-[3H]glutamate (potassium salt, 0.4 Ci/mmol,Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) at room temperature for varying times, with other additions when indicated. Uptake was stopped by the addition of 4 × 2 ml of ice-cold 0.15 m KCl and immediate filtration. Radioactivity was determined with a liquid scintillation spectrophotometer. A mouse, multiple-tissue Northern blot was purchased from Origene (Rockville, MD). Each lane was equally loaded with 2 μg of mRNA from different tissues. The blot was hybridized with [32P]dCTP-labeled VGLUT2 cDNA-specific probes generated by polymerase chain reaction (nucleotides 2216–2489 from the 3′-untranslated region, which has low homology with VGLUT1). The filter was hybridized overnight at 42 °C in 50% formamide and washed under high stringency conditions (0.1× sodium chloride/sodium citrate, 0.1% SDS at 65 °C) for 1 h (27Bai L. Collins J.F. Ghishan F.K. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 278: C1131-C1143Google Scholar). In situhybridization was performed as previously described (27Bai L. Collins J.F. Ghishan F.K. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 278: C1131-C1143Google Scholar), using paraffin-embedded mouse brain sections from Novagene (Madison, WI). The same polymerase chain reaction products used for Northern blots were subcloned in both orientations into the pCR II plasmid vector using the TA cloning kit (Invitrogen). cRNA probes were transcribed from these templates with T7 RNA polymerase using the MAXIscript in vitro transcription kit (Ambion, Austin, TX). Depending on the orientation of the insert, either sense (used as a negative control) or antisense (used as experimental) probes were generated. The cRNA transcripts were then labeled with biotin using the BrightStar Psoralen-Biotin labeling kit (Ambion). The biotinylated probes were hybridized to brain sections following the mRNAlocator-hyb kit protocol (Ambion). Briefly, mouse brain sections were rehydrated and predigested with 40 μg/ml of proteinase K for 30 min and then hybridized with 5 μg/ml of either antisense or sense cRNA probes at 55 °C for 4 h. Posthybridization washes were carried out at 55 °C three times for 4 min. The probes were detected using Ambion's mRNAlocator-biotin kit, and slides were photographed by standard light microscopy. We performed a search of the EST data base with the nucleotide sequence of human and rat VGLUT1 (BLASTx program). One mouse EST clone from amygdala exhibited significant similarity (∼49%) with human and rat VGLUT1. By sequencing the clone from Research Genetics, we obtained a 2528 bp cDNA with an open reading frame of 1746 bp with 638 bp of 5′-untranslated sequence and 134 bp of 3′-untranslated sequence, which we named VGLUT2 (GenBankTM accession number AF324864). The predicted protein has ∼75–80% amino acid identity with human and rat VGLUT1 (Fig. 1 and data not shown). Particularly, VGLUT2 showed 97% amino acid identity to a recently cloned human differential sodium-dependent phosphate cotransporter, called DNPI (28Aihara Y. Mashima H. Onda H. Hisano S. Kasuya H. Hori T. Yamada S. Tomura H. Yamada Y. Inoue I. Kojima I. Takeda J. J. Neurochem. 2000; 74: 2622-2625Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). Hydropathy analysis suggests the presence of 8–10 membrane-spanning domains. We first determined the transport activity of different membranes from VGLUT2 or vector-only transfected cells. In the presence of 4 mm ATP, chloride and MgSO4, conditions that optimize glutamate accumulation by native synaptic vesicles (12Naito S. Ueda T. J. Neurochem. 1985; 44: 99-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar, 29Carlson M.D. Kish P.E. Ueda T. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 7369-7376Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), vesicle membranes from VGLUT2-IRES2-EGFP-transfected cells exhibited 5- to 6-fold increased uptake. Plasma membrane glutamate uptake from VGLUT2-IRES2-EGFP-transfected cells did not show any differences from that of IRES2-EGFP-transfected cells (Fig.2A). The semiquantitative estimates of initial velocities of uptake were plotted in Fig.2B. Kinetic experiments indicated that VGLUT2-mediated transport is dose-dependent and saturable (Fig.2B). In one experiment depicted in Fig. 2B, the maximum velocity (Vmax) was 1405 pmol/min-mg protein, and the apparent affinity constant (Km) for glutamate was 1.2 mm. In three separate batches of membranes, the Vmax was 1219 ± 109 pmol/min-mg protein, and the Km for glutamate was 1.1 ± 0.2 mm. The Km is similar to that of glutamate transport by native synaptic vesicles as well as VGLUT1 (1∼2 mm), whereas it is in contrast to that of plasma glutamate transporters, which exhibit a Kmfor glutamate between 3 and 20 μm (15Kanner B.I. Sharon I. Biochemistry. 1978; 17: 3949-3953Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar, 16Logan W.J. Synder S.H. Brain Res. 1972; 42: 413-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). In addition to kinetic properties, vesicular glutamate transport has a number of distinct characteristics from plasma membrane glutamate transport. Accumulation of glutamate into vesicular membranes depends on the vacuolar Mg2+-ATPase, which utilizes ATP, whereas plasma membrane glutamate transport depends on energy provided by the sodium gradient. VGLUT2-mediated glutamate transport is ATP-dependent, as substitution of ATP with ADP or AMP abolished glutamate transport (Fig. 2C). To specify the type of ATPase involved in glutamate uptake by VGLUT2, we tested inhibitors for different types of ATPases in transport assays.N-ethylmaleimide (NEM), DCCD, and bafalomycin A1, inhibitors for vacuolar Mg2+-ATPase dramatically inhibited glutamate uptake. The plasma membrane and mitochondrial ATPase inhibitors, vanadate, oligomycin B, and ouabain, had no effect on glutamate uptake by VGLUT2 (Fig. 2C), which is in agreement with previous work (10Cidon S. Sihra T. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 8281-8288Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 30Fisher-Bovenkerk C. Kish P.E. Ueda T. J. Neurochem. 1988; 51: 1054-1059Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Another feature of the vesicular glutamate transporter that segregates it from other neurotransmitter transporters is the marked stimulation seen in the presence of low, physiologically relevant concentrations of chloride (12Naito S. Ueda T. J. Neurochem. 1985; 44: 99-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar, 13Tabb J.S. Kish P.E. Van Dyke R. Ueda T. J. Biol.

At low concentrations (1–5 mm), chloride stimulates transport, whereas higher concentrations (above 10 mm) inhibit transport. Fig. 2D shows that low concentrations of chloride (1–4 mm) stimulated glutamate uptake by VGLUT2, whereas concentrations higher than 10 mmattenuated the stimulatory effect, which is consistent with previous findings. Substrate specificity was also used to distinguish vesicular and plasma membrane glutamate transporters. Vesicular transporters recognize only glutamate, whereas plasma membrane transporters recognize both glutamate and aspartate. Uptake of [3H]glutamate by VGLUT2 was partially inhibited by d-glutamate, but not by a number of other compounds including aspartate, glycine, GABA, glutamine, and phosphate (Fig. 2E), which is consistent with known characteristics of glutamate transport by vesicular membranes. Evan blue, a potent inhibitor of vesicular glutamate transport, significantly blocked the uptake mediated by VGLUT2. In addition, 1 μm DIDS, an anion channel blocker, significantly inhibited VGLUT2-mediated glutamate uptake (Fig. 2E). Uptake by VGLUT2 is also pH-dependent, with the highest glutamate uptake occurring between pH 7.0 and 7.5 (Fig. 2F). To gain information about what component(s) of ΔμH+ is involved in VGLUT2 transport, we determined the effect of ionophores on VGLUT2-mediated glutamate transport. The doses of ionophores were selected by testing the minimally effective doses in preliminary studies (data not shown). As shown in Fig. 3, carbonyl cyanidep-(trifluoromethoxy)phenylhydrazone (FCCP), a protonophore acting as mobile carriers of H+-ions and dissipating both the Δψ and ΔpH components of ΔμH+, abolished glutamate uptake by VGLUT2. The K+ ionophore valinomycin, which reduces only Δψ without changing ΔpH in the presence of 4 mm KCl, deceased glutamate uptake by VGLUT2. Nigericin is an electroneutral ionophore that exchanges K+ for H+, thus eliminating ΔpH whereas allowing Δψ to increase when the H+-ATPase is working. Surprisingly, nigericin inhibited 40% of VGLUT2-mediated glutamate uptake in the presence of 4 mm KCl and subsaturating concentrations of glutamate. This observation is distinct from that of VGLUT1 in that nigericin increased VGLUT1-mediated glutamate uptake under the same conditions (19Bellocchio E.E. Reimer R.J. Fremeau Jr., R.T. Edwards R.H. Science. 2000; 289: 957-960Crossref PubMed Scopus (666) Google Scholar). But this is in agreement with previous results on synaptic vesicles (13Tabb J.S. Kish P.E. Van Dyke R. Ueda T. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 15412-15418Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 31Ozkan E.D. Ueda T. Jpn. J. Pharmacol. 1998; 77: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the addition of both nigericin and valinomycin together essentially abolished glutamate uptake by VGLUT2. Mouse VGLUT2 expression was examined by probing poly(A)+ RNA from heart, brain, spleen, lung, liver, skeleton muscle, kidney, and testis. Northern blot analysis using mouse VGLUT2-specific probes detected a single transcript of ∼3.8 kbp, with a strong hybridization signal observed only in brain (Fig. 4). In situ hybridization was then carried out to determine the regional and cellular expression of VGLUT2 mRNA in the mouse brain (Fig.5). VGLUT2 is highly expressed in neuron-rich regions of the cerebral cortex (Fig. 5A), the hippocampus (Fig. 5B), and the hypothalamus (not shown). It is notable that VGLUT2 is highly expressed in neurons of the thalamus (Fig. 5, C and F), whereas VGLUT1 showed no or very low expression in the thalamus (20Ni B. Wu X. Yan G.M. Wang J. Paul S.M. J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 5789-5799Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 28Aihara Y. Mashima H. Onda H. Hisano S. Kasuya H. Hori T. Yamada S. Tomura H. Yamada Y. Inoue I. Kojima I. Takeda J. J. Neurochem. 2000; 74: 2622-2625Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). Very little if any specific signal was observed with sense probe (Fig. 5, G andH). Although the signal was present throughout layers II-VI of the cortex, VGLUT2 is more abundant in layers III to V, where a distinct signal is observed in pyramidal neurons (Fig. 5D). The hippocampus is very densely labeled compared with other brain regions. At higher magnification, VGLUT2 can be seen to be concentrated in pyramidal neurons of the hippocampus (Fig. 5E). Moreover, VGLUT2 mRNA is mainly localized to the cell bodies (Fig. 5,D, E, and F).Figure 5In situ hybridization analysis ofVGLUT2 expression in mouse brain. Mouse brain sections were hybridized with a biotin-labeled specific antisense (panels A–F) and sense (panels G and H: × 8) probes. Mouse VGLUT2 is highly expressed in the cerebral cortex (CTX) (panel A: × 8; panel D × 30), hippocampus (HP) (panel B: × 8; panel E: × 30), and thalamus (TH) (panel C: × 8;panel F: × 30).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Glutamate is the major excitatory neurotransmitter in the mammalian central nervous system. It has been shown that glutamate can be accumulated into synaptic vesicles to concentrations of at least 60 mm through an ATP-dependent mechanism (32Burger P.M. Mehl E. Cameron P.L. Maycox P.R. Baumer M. Lottspeich F. De Camilli P. Jahn R. Neuron. 1989; 3: 715-720Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar, 33Naito S. Ueda T. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 696-699Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The vesicular transport system, in contrast to the sodium-dependent plasma membrane transport system, is specific for glutamate, has a low affinity for glutamate, and is stimulated by physiologically relevant concentrations of chloride (12Naito S. Ueda T. J. Neurochem. 1985; 44: 99-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar,13Tabb J.S. Kish P.E. Van Dyke R. Ueda T. J. Biol.

These unique properties of the vesicular glutamate transporter are conserved in such diverse vertebrates as fish, reptiles, amphibians, and mammals (34Tabb J.S. Ueda T. J. Neurosci. 1991; 11: 1822-1828Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Consistent with these observations, glutamate was transported by VGLUT2 in the absence of sodium. Furthermore, the transport required ATP and was inhibited by specific inhibitors of the V-ATPase. Glutamate transported by VGLUT2 is saturable with a Km of 1.1 mm, which is consistent with characteristics of the vesicular glutamate transporter. In addition, VGLUT2 is specific for glutamate and does not transport aspartate or other amino acids. The requirement of low Cl− concentrations is a significant property of vesicular glutamate transport. The presence of chloride at low concentrations (1–5 mm) is essential for the uptake of glutamate, with substantially lower transport activity observed at higher and lower levels (9Maycox P.R. Deckwerth T. Hell J.W. Jahn R. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 15423-15428Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Tabb J.S. Kish P.E. Van Dyke R. Ueda T. J. Biol.

This biphasic effect of chloride and the DIDS-sensitive chloride dependence of glutamate uptake, have suggested that the vesicular glutamate transporter possesses an anion binding site, distinct from the substrate binding site, which regulates transporter activity (35Hartinger J. Jahn R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23122-23127Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Chloride showed a similar effect on glutamate uptake by VGLUT2. We also observed a 70% inhibition in VGLUT2-mediated glutamate uptake by 1 μm DIDS, which is consistent with previous findings. Taken together, these functional characteristics suggest that VGLUT2 functions as a vesicular glutamate transporter. Based on the high homology (97% at the amino acid level) between mouse VGLUT2 and human DNPI, we surmised that DNPI is the human homologue of mouse VGLUT2. By using Xenopus oocytes expressing hDNPI, Aihara et al. (28Aihara Y. Mashima H. Onda H. Hisano S. Kasuya H. Hori T. Yamada S. Tomura H. Yamada Y. Inoue I. Kojima I. Takeda J. J. Neurochem. 2000; 74: 2622-2625Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar) observed an ∼75% increase in sodium-dependent phosphate uptake. However, in our substrate specificity experiments, high concentrations of phosphate did not inhibit glutamate uptake by VGLUT2, suggesting that phosphate was not transported by the same mechanism as glutamate. This is a similar situation to VGLUT1, where weak sodium-dependent phosphate uptake was observed in oocyte plasma membranes expressing VGLUT1 (23Ni B. Du Y. Wu X. DeHoff B.S. Rosteck Jr., P.R. Paul S.M. J. Neurochem. 1996; 66: 2227-2238Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar,24Ni B. Roseteck P.R. Nadi N.S. Paul S.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 5607-5611Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar), and relatively strong ATP-dependent glutamate uptake was observed in vesicular membranes expressing VGLUT1 (18Takmori S. Rhee J.S. Rosenmund C. Jahn R. Nature. 2000; 407: 189-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (712) Google Scholar, 19Bellocchio E.E. Reimer R.J. Fremeau Jr., R.T. Edwards R.H. Science. 2000; 289: 957-960Crossref PubMed Scopus (666) Google Scholar). The relationship between glutamate and phosphate transport by VGLUT1 and VGLUT2 remains unclear. As has been proposed for VGLUT1 (19Bellocchio E.E. Reimer R.J. Fremeau Jr., R.T. Edwards R.H. Science. 2000; 289: 957-960Crossref PubMed Scopus (666) Google Scholar), VGLUT2 may be a bifunctional transporter, which functions as a phosphate transporter at the plasma membrane and a glutamate transporter in synaptic vesicles. Whereas it is known that vesicular glutamate transport is driven by an electrochemical proton gradient generated by V-ATPase, the precise manner in which the glutamate transporter and V-ATPase operate is currently under debate. To assess the driving forces of glutamate transport mediated by VGLUT2, we tested the effect of different ionophores on VGLUT2-mediated glutamate uptake. In the presence of 4 mm KCl, the K+ ionophore valinomycin, which reduces only Δψ without changing ΔpH, deceased glutamate uptake by VGLUT2 by 50%. Nigericin, an electroneutral ionophore that exchanges K+ for H+, eliminates ΔpH whereas allowing Δψ to increase in the presence of 4 mm KCl and subsaturating concentrations of glutamate, inhibited glutamate uptake by VGLUT2 by 40%. This result is consistent with previous findings that both the Δψ and ΔpH components are driving forces for the transport of glutamate into synaptic vesicles (13Tabb J.S. Kish P.E. Van Dyke R. Ueda T. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 15412-15418Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, this functional characteristic is distinct from VGLUT1, because Δψ was suggested as the primary driving force for VGLUT1 (18Takmori S. Rhee J.S. Rosenmund C. Jahn R. Nature. 2000; 407: 189-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (712) Google Scholar, 19Bellocchio E.E. Reimer R.J. Fremeau Jr., R.T. Edwards R.H. Science. 2000; 289: 957-960Crossref PubMed Scopus (666) Google Scholar). Thus, one possible explanation of the previous controversial results observed in synaptic vesicles could be the differing functions of two closely related isoforms. Further elucidation of molecular differences between these two isoforms may answer this question. Another interesting finding is that the two vesicular glutamate transporters have different expression patterns in brain. VGLUT1 is only expressed in a subset of glutamatergic neurons in the cerebral cortex, hippocampus, and cerebellum (20Ni B. Wu X. Yan G.M. Wang J. Paul S.M. J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 5789-5799Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), whereas VGLUT2 is expressed in cerebral cortex, hippocampus, and the thalamus (Fig. 5). Thalamic nuclei use glutamate as their neurotransmitter but they lack VGLUT1 mRNA and protein (17Bellocchio E.E. Hu H. Pohorille A. Chan J. Pickel V.M. Edwards R.H. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 8648-8659Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 20Ni B. Wu X. Yan G.M. Wang J. Paul S.M. J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 5789-5799Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, VGLUT2 appears to be an important glutamate transporter in thalamic neuronal vesicles. In addition, DNPI, the human homologue of VGLUT2, was highly expressed in the fetal brain when VGLUT1 was not expressed (28Aihara Y. Mashima H. Onda H. Hisano S. Kasuya H. Hori T. Yamada S. Tomura H. Yamada Y. Inoue I. Kojima I. Takeda J. J. Neurochem. 2000; 74: 2622-2625Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar), suggesting that VGLUT2 rather than VGLUT1 might be important in the initial steps of neuronal differentiation. In summary, we have cloned and functionally characterized a novel vesicular glutamate transporter expressed in the mouse brain. The VGLUT2 cDNA encodes a protein of 582 amino acids with 75% identity with human VGLUT1, the first identified vesicular glutamate transporter. All of the major functional characteristics of VGLUT2, such as ATP dependence, chloride stimulation, substrate specificity, substrate affinity, and mode of energization, are consistent with that of a glutamate transporter previously characterized from synaptic, vesicular membranes. Thus, VGLUT2 functions as a vesicular glutamate transporter. Identification of two isoforms with different functional characteristics provides molecular information for structure-function studies of vesicular glutamate transporters. In addition, the presence of VGLUT2 in brain regions lacking VGLUT1 suggests that the two isoforms together might account for glutamate transport into synaptic vesicles in glutamatergic neurons.

Inactivation of MAP kinases occurs by dephosphorylation of Thr(P) and Tyr(P) in the TXY kinase activation motif. To gain insight into the mechanism of ERK2 inactivation by MKP3, we have carried out an analysis of the MKP3-catalyzed dephosphorylation of the phosphorylated ERK2. We find that ERK2/pTpY dephosphorylation by MKP3 involves an ordered, distributive mechanism in which MKP3 binds the bisphosphorylated ERK2/pTpY, dephosphorylates Tyr(P) first, dissociates and releases the monophosphorylated ERK2/pT, which is then subjected to dephosphorylation by a second MKP3, yielding the fully dephosphorylated ERK2. The bisphosphorylated ERK2 is a highly specific substrate for MKP3 with a k cat/K m of 3.8 × 106m−1s−1, which is more than 6 orders of magnitude higher than that for small molecule aryl phosphates and an ERK2-derived phosphopeptide encompassing the pTEpY motif. This strikingly high substrate specificity displayed by MKP3 may result from a combination of high affinity binding interactions between the N-terminal domain of MKP3 and ERK2 and specific ERK2-induced allosteric activation of the MKP3 C-terminal phosphatase domain.

The three best characterized MAP kinases are the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), and the p38 kinase (1Widmann C. Gibson S. Jarpe M.B. Johnson G.L. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 143-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (2249) Google Scholar). Although ERK responds vigorously to growth factors and certain hormones, JNK and p38 react primarily to cytokines and stress stimuli. MAP kinases are activated by MAP kinase kinases (MEKs), which are dual specificity kinases that phosphorylate the conserved Tyr and Thr located within the TXY motif in the activation loop of the MAP kinase (2Ahn N.G.

Cell. 1997; 90: 859-869Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (617) Google Scholar). Although the mechanism for MAP kinase activation has been well characterized, much less is known about its subsequent inactivation. Increasing evidence suggests that multiple phosphatases are involved in MAP kinase inactivation (5Cobb M.H. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 1999; 71: 479-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (757) Google Scholar).The MAP kinase phosphatases (MKPs) are dual specificity phosphatases capable of dephosphorylating both Tyr(P) and Thr(P) in the activation loop of MAP kinases (6Camps M. Nichols A. Arkinstall S. FASEB J. 2000; 14: 6-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (710) Google Scholar, 7Keyse S.M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 186-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (702) Google Scholar). MKPs belong to the protein-tyrosine phosphatase (PTPase) superfamily, which is defined by the PTPase signature motif (H/V)C(X)5 R(S/T). Mechanistic studies on PTPases have mostly been conducted with small molecule aryl phosphates, such as p-nitrophenyl phosphate (pNPP), and phosphopeptides. These studies have shown that the tyrosine-specific PTPases and the dual specificity phosphatases share a common catalytic mechanism to effect catalysis (8Zhang Z.-Y. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1998; 33: 1-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). The PTPases utilize the Cys in the signature motif as a nucleophile in the formation of a thiophosphoryl covalent enzyme intermediate (9Guan K.L. Dixon J.E. J. Biol.

The invariant Arg residue in the PTPase signature motif functions in substrate binding and in transition state stabilization (11Zhang Z.-Y. Wang Y. Wu L. Fauman E. Stuckey J.A. Schubert H.L.

Soc. 1999; 121: 9514-9521Crossref Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The initial phosphoryl transfer from the substrate to the enzyme is assisted by a conserved Asp on a surface loop, which protonates the leaving group (14Zhang Z.-Y. Wang Y. Dixon J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1624-1627Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar, 15Hengge A.C. Sowa G. Wu L. Zhang Z.-Y. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 13982-13987Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar), thereby acting as a general acid catalyst. The phosphoenzyme intermediate undergoes hydrolysis in a second step, which is catalyzed by the same Asp residue acting as a general base (16Wu L. Zhang Z.-Y. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 5426-5434Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar).Although studies with small molecule substrates have yielded useful information about PTPase catalysis, further understanding of the specific functional role of PTPases in cellular signaling requires detailed investigation of PTPases with physiological substrates. Activated MAP kinases are physiological substrates for MKPs. In mammalian cells, at least nine MKPs have been identified. Previous studies suggest that these MKPs display distinct in vivosubstrate preferences for the various MAP kinases (6Camps M. Nichols A. Arkinstall S. FASEB J. 2000; 14: 6-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (710) Google Scholar, 7Keyse S.M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 186-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (702) Google Scholar).

Science. 1998; 280: 1262-1265Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar), little is known about how MKP3 catalyzes the dephosphorylation of the activated ERKs. In addition, MKP3 is a dual specificity phosphatase that can hydrolyze both Thr(P)183 and Tyr(P)185 in ERK2 (19Groom L.A. Sneddon A.A. Alessi D.R. Dowd S. Keyse S.M.

Because activated ERK2 contains two phosphorylated residues in close proximity, it is unclear whether the MKP3-catalyzed inactivation of ERK2 involves a processive or a distributive dephosphorylation mechanism (Scheme FS1).In this study, we used a constitutively active MEK1 (MEK1/G7B, MEK1/Δ44–51/S218D/M219D/N221D/S222D) (24Mansour S.J.

Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 15529-15536Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar) to prepare milligram quantities of stoichiometrically 32P-labeled, bisphosphorylated ERK2 (ERK2/pTpY). This has allowed us to fully characterize the kinetic mechanism of the MKP3-catalyzed ERK2 dephosphorylation. Our results show that the MKP3-catalyzed ERK2 dephosphorylation is ordered (with a preference for Tyr(P)) and distributive. Our results also shed light on the molecular basis of MKP3 substrate specificity for ERK2.DISCUSSIONIt is well known that both the magnitude and duration of ERK1/2 activation are important in determining cell fate (1Widmann C. Gibson S. Jarpe M.B. Johnson G.L. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 143-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (2249) Google Scholar, 5Cobb M.H. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 1999; 71: 479-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (757) Google Scholar). For example, in PC12 cells, transient induction of ERK1/2 activity promotes cell proliferation, whereas sustained activation of ERK1/2 drives cells into neuronal differentiation (49Marshall C.J. Cell. 1995; 80: 179-185Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4222) Google Scholar). The only known mechanism for ERK1/2 activation is through dual phosphorylation by MEK1/2 of the Thr and Tyr residues in the activation loop motif TEY (2Ahn N.G. Seger R. Bratlien R.L. Diltz C.D.

Cell. 1997; 90: 859-869Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (617) Google Scholar). Because activated ERK1/2 contain both Thr(P) and Tyr(P), they could serve as substrates for all classes of protein phosphatases. Thus, ERK1/2 deactivation could occur through the action of serine/threonine protein phosphatase PP2A (40Alessi D.R. Gomez N. Moorhead G. Lewis T. Keyse S.M. Cohen P. Curr. Biol. 1995; 5: 283-295Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar), tyrosine-specific PTPases PTP-SL and HePTP (41Pulido R. Zuniga A. Ullrich A.

The fact that multiple phosphatases are involved in the inactivation of ERK1/2 suggests that phosphatases may play a crucial role in determining cellular responses to external stimuli and that the duration and extent of ERK activation may be controlled by the balanced activities of MEKs and various ERK-specific phosphatases.At least nine different MKPs have been described (6Camps M. Nichols A. Arkinstall S. FASEB J. 2000; 14: 6-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (710) Google Scholar, 7Keyse S.M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 186-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (702) Google Scholar). This implies a considerable complexity in the regulation of MAP kinase signaling by these phosphatases. However, despite the remarkable progress in the identification and characterization of new MKPs, the molecular basis by which MKPs distinguish and recognize various MAP kinases that they encounter in the cell remains elusive. MKP3 prefers ERK1/2 to JNK and p38 when overexpressed in mammalian cell culture (17Muda M. Boschert U. Dickinson R. Martinou J.C. Martinou I. Camps M. Schlegel W. Arkinstall S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4319-4326Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar, 19Groom L.A. Sneddon A.A. Alessi D.R. Dowd S. Keyse S.M. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3621-3632Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). To begin to understand the molecular basis of specific ERK2 inactivation by MKP3, we have carried out a detailed mechanistic study of the MKP3-catalyzed ERK2 dephosphorylation. Our results shed light on several aspects of MKP3 catalysis, including the mechanism of ERK2 dephosphorylation and the molecular basis of substrate specificity and dual specificity.ERK2/pTpY Dephosphorylation by MKP3 Occurs by an Ordered, Distributive MechanismFour lines of evidence suggest that ERK2/pTpY dephosphorylation by MKP3 proceeds by an ordered, distributive mechanism. First, MKP3 displays a preference for Tyr(P) hydrolysis in bisphosphorylated ERK2 under both single-turnover and steady state conditions. Thus, dephosphorylation of Thr(P) always lags behind that of Tyr(P). If the mechanism were processive, one would expect an identical rate of hydrolysis for both Tyr(P) and Thr(P) under steady state conditions. Second, there is no accumulation of the monophosphorylated ERK2/pY during the MKP3-catalyzed ERK2/pTpY dephosphorylation (Fig. 5). This result indicates that Tyr(P) hydrolysis in ERK2/pTpY occurs first and that Thr(P) hydrolysis in ERK2/pTpY cannot happen unless Tyr(P) is already dephosphorylated. Third, monophosphorylated ERK2/pT accumulates and exceeds the amount of MKP3 in the MKP3-catalyzed dephosphorylation of ERK2/pTpY. This is consistent with the observation that, after the initial Tyr(P) hydrolysis, ERK2/pT falls off MKP3. In contrast, if the mechanism were processive, one would not expect to see accumulation of monophosphorylated species in excess of the catalytic amount of MKP3 present in the reaction. Finally, the monophosphorylated species generated from the first dephosphorylation event can be efficiently processed to yield the final product, the unphosphorylated ERK2, because the monophosphorylated species are equally good as substrates as the bisphosphorylated ERK2. Collectively, our results are consistent with an ordered, distributive mechanism in which MKP3 can bind ERK2/pTpY, dephosphorylate Tyr(P) first, dissociate, and release the monophosphorylated ERK2/pT. ERK2/pT can then be dephosphorylated by a second molecule of MKP3, yielding the fully dephosphorylated ERK2 (Scheme FS2).However, it is important to point out that, although our data do not support a complete processive model, they cannot exclude the possibility of a partially processive mechanism, in which some MKP3 molecules hydrolyze both Tyr(P) and Thr(P) before dissociating from ERK2. Because processivity is controlled by the relative rates at which the MKP3·ERK2/pT and MKP3·ERK2/pY complexes dissociate compared with the rates at which the MKP3·ERK2/pT and MKP3·ERK2/pY give rise to ERK2 (Scheme FS1), it is conceivable that in vivo the dephosphorylation of ERK2/pTpY could become more or completely processive in the presence of appropriate scaffolding proteins or cofactors that enhance the affinity of MKP3 for ERK2. In contrast, mutations that reduce the affinity of MKP3 for ERK2 or slow down the chemistry would render the reaction more distributive, as observed in this study for MKP3/ΔN151 and MKP3/D262N. In any event, processive or distributive, our data show that MKP3 can carry out the dephosphorylation of both Thr(P) and Tyr(P) in ERK2 very efficiently. This may have significant biological implications.It has been shown that constitutively active MEK1 carries out its dual phosphorylation of ERK2 by a distributive mechanism, and it has been argued that nonprocessive ERK2 phosphorylation is important for the fidelity and sensitivity of ERK2 signaling (29Ferrell Jr., J.E. Bhatt R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19008-19016Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar, 39Burack W.R. Sturgill T.W. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 5929-5933Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). The specificity of ERK2 activation should be greater under a distributive mechanism than under a processive mechanism, since activation depends upon two independent MEK1 binding events rather than one. Presumably, the action of PP2A and HePTP on ERK2/pTpY would generate monophosphorylated ERK2 species, which would allow MEK1 to activate ERK2 more rapidly under certain conditions. Efficient removal of the phosphate group from both Thr(P) and Tyr(P) of activated ERK2 by MKP3 may be important for prolonged inactivation and efficient repriming of the ERK signaling cycle.Molecular Basis of the Dual Specificity of MKP3 toward ERK2MKP3 is a dual specificity phosphatase and is capable of dephosphorylating efficiently both the Tyr(P) and the Thr(P) on ERK2. VHR is also a dual specificity phosphatase, and ERK2 has been suggested to be an authentic substrate for VHR (52Todd J.L. Tanner K.G. Denu J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13271-13280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). However, aside from the active site, the crystal structures of the catalytic domain of MKP3 (23Stewart A.E. Dowd S. Keyse S.M. McDonald N.Q. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 174-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar) and VHR (53Yuvaniyama J. Denu J.M. Dixon J.E. Saper M.A. Science. 1996; 272: 1328-1331Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar) do not provide any evidence for the existence of a second phosphoamino acid-binding site. It appears that the same active site is responsible for both Tyr(P) and Ser(P)/Thr(P) hydrolysis in dual specificity phosphatases (Ref. 35Zhou G. Denu J.M. Wu L. Dixon J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28084-28090Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, and this work). The structural basis for the dual specificity has been attributed to the shallow active site cleft, with a depth of 5.5 Å in MKP3 (23Stewart A.E. Dowd S. Keyse S.M. McDonald N.Q. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 174-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar) and 6 Å in VHR (53Yuvaniyama J. Denu J.M. Dixon J.E. Saper M.A. Science. 1996; 272: 1328-1331Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar), which can accommodate both Tyr(P) and Thr(P). The much deeper active site pocket (9 Å) in PTPases selects exclusively Tyr(P)-containing substrates (54Jia Z. Barford D. Flint A.J. Tonks N.K. Science. 1995; 268: 1754-1758Crossref PubMed Scopus (550) Google Scholar, 55Dunn D. Chen L. Lawrence D.S. Zhang Z.-Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 168-173Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). However, VHR was found to dephosphorylate only Tyr(P) in ERK2/pTpY (52Todd J.L. Tanner K.G. Denu J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13271-13280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). We have confirmed that VHR can only hydrolyze Tyr(P) in ERK2/pTpY (data not shown). This suggests that the depth of the active site is not the sole determinant for dual specificity. In addition, under identical conditions used for MKP3, we determined the k cat andK m for the VHR-catalyzed dephosphorylation of32P-labeled ERK2/pTpY to be 0.004 ± 0.001 s−1 and 3.8 ± 0.9 µm, respectively, by monitoring directly the release of 32P-labeled phosphate. Thus, the k cat/K m for the VHR-catalyzed ERK2/pTpY dephosphorylation (1.1 × 103m−1 s−1) is >103-fold lower than that for the MKP3 reaction (3.8 × 106m−1 s−1).Given the huge difference in intrinsic chemical reactivity (105-fold) between Tyr(P) and Thr(P), it is remarkable that MKP3 can hydrolyze Thr(P) and Tyr(P) in ERK2 with similar efficiency. What is the molecular basis for the dual specificity of MKP3? VHR is a small protein (20 kDa) made of a single phosphatase domain that shares considerable sequence homology with the catalytic domain of MKP3 (37% identity and 49% similarity). MKP3 differs from VHR in that it also contains an N-terminal non-catalytic domain, which can interact with ERK2. We initially reasoned that the high affinity binding between the N-terminal domain of MKP3 and ERK2 might be responsible for the higher MKP3 activity and compensate for the difference of 5 orders of magnitude in the intrinsic reactivity between Tyr(P) and Thr(P), resulting in dual specificity of MKP3 toward ERK2. We found that disruption of the N-terminal domain binding with ERK2 either by deletion of residues 1–151 in MKP3 or introduction of aSevenmaker type of mutation (D319N) in ERK2 resulted in a decrease by 2 orders of magnitude ink cat/K m compared with those of the wild-type MKP3 or ERK2. However, disruption of the N-terminal domain binding with ERK2 only had a modest effect (severalfold) on the ability of MKP3 to dephosphorylate Thr(P) relative to Tyr(P) in ERK2/pTpY. Thus, the N-terminal domain of MKP3 is not a major determinant for the dual specificity of MKP3 toward ERK2.We next evaluated the role of the general acid Asp262 in conferring dual specificity to MKP3. The function of the general acid in PTPase catalysis is to donate a proton to the phenolate/alkoxide oxygen to facilitate the expulsion of the leaving group (8Zhang Z.-Y. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1998; 33: 1-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). Phosphate dianion monoester hydrolysis displays a strong dependence on the leaving group pK a with a βlg of −1.27 in uncatalyzed solution reaction (56Kirby A.J. Varvoglis A.G. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1967; 89: 415-423Crossref Scopus (380) Google Scholar). In contrast, little leaving group dependence is observed for the PTPase reaction (8Zhang Z.-Y. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1998; 33: 1-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). Thus, in effect, the presence of general acid catalysis in PTPases “neutralizes” the intrinsic difference in chemical reactivity of the different phosphate esters. When the general acid functionality is impaired, large leaving group dependence is observed in PTPase reactions (16Wu L. Zhang Z.-Y. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 5426-5434Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 57Denu J.M. Lohse D.L. Vijayalakshmi J. Saper M.A. Dixon J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 2493-2498Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar, 58Keng Y.-F. Wu L. Zhang Z.-Y. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 259: 809-814Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Thus, one would expect that removal of the general acid functionality should lead to a more severe effect on Thr(P) hydrolysis than on Tyr(P). Indeed, mutation of Asp262 to Asn lowered the k cat for the MKP3-catalyzed dephosphorylation of Tyr(P) in ERK2/pTpY by 2 orders of magnitude while at the same time it rendered MKP3 incapable of dephosphorylating Thr(P) in ERK2/pTpY (Fig. 8). These results indicate that the general acid Asp262 is essential for the dual specificity and catalytic efficiency of MKP3.The corresponding general acid, Asp92, is intact in VHR, yet VHR is unable to dephosphorylate Thr(P) in ERK2. One likely explanation for VHR's lack of activity toward Thr(P) in ERK2 is that the action of the general acid is substrate-dependent. It is interesting to note that the k cat (0.004 s−1) for VHR-catalyzed dephosphorylation of Tyr(P) in ERK2/pTpY is similar to that of the general acid-deficient VHR/D92N-catalyzed hydrolysis of free Tyr(P) amino acid (57Denu J.M. Lohse D.L. Vijayalakshmi J. Saper M.A. Dixon J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 2493-2498Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). Thus, Asp92 may not be functional in the VHR·ERK2/pTpY complex, possibly due to incorrect positioning of the general acid with respect to the substrate. This leads to reduced turnover number for ERK2/pY and even more reduced still (in fact undetectable) for ERK2/pT hydrolysis. In fact, we are aware of several precedents in which perturbation of the exact positioning of the general acid in PTPases impairs its function (58Keng Y.-F. Wu L. Zhang Z.-Y. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 259: 809-814Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 59Hoff R.H. Hengge A.C. Wu L. Keng Y.-F. Zhang Z.-Y. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 46-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Along the same line, we also note that MKP3 can only dephosphorylate Tyr(P) but not Thr(P) in the context of the synthetic bisphosphorylated peptide (DHTGFLpTEpYVATR) derived from the activation lip of ERK2 (34Wiland A.M. Denu J.M. Mourey R.J. Dixon J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 33486-33492Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Furthermore, MKP3 is ∼100-fold less active toward activated p38 kinase than ERK2/pTpY and it can only dephosphorylate Tyr(P) in the activated p38 (19Groom L.A. Sneddon A.A. Alessi D.R. Dowd S. Keyse S.M. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3621-3632Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). These results are consistent with the notion that the general acid Asp262 in MKP3 is not functional in the presence of nonphysiological substrates.The superiority of ERK2/pTpY to the ERK2-derived phosphopeptide and the bisphosphorylated p38 as a MKP3 substrate most likely results from specific protein-protein interactions between ERK2 and MKP3 that are not available between the ERK2 phosphopeptide and MKP3 or between bisphosphorylated p38 and MKP3. Specific protein-protein interactions between ERK2 and MKP3 may be required to favorably orient the general acid and the leaving group for highly efficient ERK2 dephosphorylation. Binding of a small peptide substrate or a nonspecific substrate to MKP3 may not be sufficient to enable such a conformational change in MKP3 so that the general acid Asp262 will not function in catalysis. We note that, even in the absence of the N-terminal domain, the catalytic domain of MKP3 is still able to dephosphorylate both Tyr(P) and Thr(P) in ERK2 (Ref. 23Stewart A.E. Dowd S. Keyse S.M. McDonald N.Q. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 174-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, and this work). Thus, it appears that binding of ERK2/pTpY to the MKP3 catalytic domain is sufficient to organize the structure within the MKP3 active site such that Asp262 will be correctly positioned to participate in catalysis. In contrast, the interaction between VHR and ERK2/pTpY may not allow the general acid to function properly. In the context of the above discussion and the fact that the value ofk cat/K m for the VHR-catalyzed ERK/pTpY dephosphorylation is at least 1000-fold lower than that for the MKP3 reaction, it is debatable whether ERK2 is a physiological substrate for VHR.When the data are taken together, the molecular basis for efficient dual dephosphorylation of ERK2/pTpY by MKP3 may lie in the specific interactions between ERK2 and MKP3 that are not possible between nonspecific substrates and MKP3. The specific interactions between ERK2 and MKP3 may induce a conformational change in MKP3 (see below) that is important for the precise orientation of the geometry of the general acid and other active site residues with respect to the phosphoamino acid for efficient dephosphorylation.A Substrate-induced Fit Mechanism for MKP3 Activation and SpecificityMKP3 exhibits very low activity toward small aryl phosphates (e.g. pNPP and Tyr(P); Ref. 36Zhou B.

The molecular mechanisms responsible for pro-caspase-1 processing remain largely enigmatic. However, a CARD-containing serine/threonine kinase, RIP2/CARDIAK/RICK, has been described that can bind to the CARD of pro-caspase-1 and trigger caspase-1 proteolytic processing and activation (19Thome M. Hofmann K. Burns K. Martinon F. Bodmer J.L. Mattmann C. Tschopp J. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 885-888Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), probably by the “induced proximity” mechanism (20Salvesen G. Dixit V.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 10964-10967Crossref PubMed Scopus (773) Google Scholar). The CARD of RIP2 is required for its interaction with and activation of pro-caspase-1 involving heterotypic CARD-CARD interactions between these proteins (19Thome M. Hofmann K. Burns K. Martinon F. Bodmer J.L. Mattmann C. Tschopp J. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 885-888Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, an inhibitor of pro-caspase-1 activation has been described, termed ICEBERG, which consists essentially only of a CARD (21Humke E.W. Shriver S.K. Starovasnik M.A. Fairbrother W.J. Dixit V.M. Cell. 2000; 103: 99-111Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). The CARD of ICEBERG has considerable homology to the caspase-1 prodomain and binds to the corresponding CARD motif present in both pro-caspase-1 and RIP2. ICEBERG functions as a competitive antagonist of RIP2/pro-caspase-1 interactions and inhibits caspase-1-dependent pro-IL-1β secretion in mononuclear cells (21Humke E.W. Shriver S.K. Starovasnik M.A. Fairbrother W.J. Dixit V.M. Cell. 2000; 103: 99-111Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). Using bioinformatics approaches, we have identified a human gene that encodes a novel CARD-containing protein, COP (CARD-only protein). Similar to ICEBERG, the COP protein is relatively short (97 amino acids), composed essentially of only a CARD that shares impressive sequence identity with the CARD of pro-caspase-1. COP binds to both pro-caspase-1 and RIP2, inhibiting caspase-1-induced IL-1β secretion. ACOP cDNA was identified by searching the expressed sequence tag (EST) data bases of GenBankTM using the nucleotide sequence of the caspase-1 prodomain as a query with the BLASTn program. An EST (GenBankTM accession numberAA070591) was found to have a high degree of sequence identity to the prodomain of caspase-1. The corresponding EST clone was obtained from IMAGE Consortium (Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, MO). The entire open reading frame of COP was amplified by PCR using a set of primers, 5′-CCAGAATTCATGGCCGACAAGGTCCTGAAG-3′ (forward) and 5′-CCACTCGAGCTAATTTCCAGGTATCGGACC-3′ (reverse). The PCR product was digested with EcoRI-XhoI and ligated into mammalian expression vectors pcDNA3-Myc, pcDNA3-HA, and pcDNA3-Flag at EcoRI-XhoI cloning sites. Plasmids encoding wild-type pro-caspase-1, RIP2, and pro-IL-1β have been described (19Thome M. Hofmann K. Burns K. Martinon F. Bodmer J.L. Mattmann C. Tschopp J. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 885-888Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Nett-Fiordalisi M. Tomaselli K. Russell J.H. Chaplin D.D. J.

A pro-caspase-1 C285A mutant was made from wild-type caspase-1 plasmid by site-directed mutagenesis using a commercially available kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) and the primers 5′-GATCATCATCCAGGCCGCCCGTGGTGACAGCCCTGG-3-′ and 5′-CCAGGGCTGTCACCACGGGCGGCCTGGATGATGATC-3′. A truncation mutant of pro-caspase-1 in which a stop codon was introduced downstream of the CARD was created by PCR using primers 5′-CGGAATTCATGGCCGACAAGGTCCTG-3′ and CGCTCGAGTTAGTCTTGCATATTAAGGTAATTTCCAGA-3′. Human embryonic kidney 293T cells were cultured at 37 °C in 5% CO2 in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum. Cells in log phase were transfected in 60-mm-diameter dishes with expression plasmids (5 μg total DNA) using Superfect transfection reagent (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Cells were harvested 2 days later and lysed in ice-cold Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 142.5 mm KCl, 0.2% Nonidet P-40, 5 mm EGTA) supplemented with 1 mm dithiothreitol, 12.5 mmβ-glycerophosphate, 1 μmNa3VO4, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1× protease inhibitor mix (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Cell lysates (0.5 ml) were clarified by centrifugation at 16,000 × g for 5 min and subjected to immunoprecipitation using specific antibodies, including anti-Myc (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) and anti-Flag antibodies (Sigma), in combination with 15 μl of protein A- or G-Sepharose (Zymed Laboratories Inc., South San Francisco, CA). Immunocomplexes were fractionated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. The resulting blots were incubated with various antibodies, including anti-HA (1:1000 v/v, Roche Molecular Biochemicals), anti-Myc (1: 100 v/v, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and anti-Flag antibodies (1:1000 v/v, Sigma), followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies and detection by an enhanced chemiluminescence method (ECL,Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Alternatively, lysates were analyzed directly by immunoblotting after normalization for total protein content. Blots containing poly(A)-selected mRNA from various adult tissues (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA) were hybridized using a 32P-labeled COPcDNA probe. The probe represented a 570-base pair long cDNA containing portions of the 5′-untranslated region, the complete open reading frame, and portions of the 3′-untranslated region ofCOP. The COP probe (GenBankTMaccession number AA070591) was excised from the plasmid by restriction digestion with EcoRI and XhoI, gel-purified, and radiolabeled by the random priming method using [α-32P]dCTP and a kit from Ambion (Austin, TX). After hybridization, heat-denatured probe was annealed for 1 h at 68 °C with QuickHyb hybridization solution (Stratagene), and then blots were washed with solutions containing 2× SSC, 0.1% (w/v) SDS (twice each for 15 min at 25 °C) followed by 0.1× SSC, 0.1% (w/v) SDS (twice for 10 min at 40 °C). Bands were visualized by autoradiography. For RT-PCR analysis of COP mRNA, cDNA samples derived from multiple human adult tissues (CLONTECH) were amplified using a set of COP-specific primers (a forward primer, 5′-GAAGACAGTTACCTGGCAGA-3′, and a reverse primer, 5′-TTGTATTCTGAACATGGCACC-3′). The resulting PCR products were size-fractionated by electrophoresis in 1.5% agarose gels and then stained with ethidium bromide for UV photography. In some cases, bands were excised from gels, purified, and sequenced, thus verifying amplification of the correct product by this RT-PCR assay. COS-7, 293T, or 293HEK cells were co-transfected in 12-well (22-mm diameter) plates using LipofectAMINE Plus reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.) with plasmids encoding mouse pro-IL-1β, human caspase-1, RIP2, or COP in various amounts (total DNA = 2.0 μg). Histiocytoma cells (human fibrosarcoma cell line) were transfected in 12-well plates using Superfect transfection reagent (Qiagen) with plasmids encoding Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) and/or COP in various amounts (total DNA = 1.5 μg). After transfection, the cells were incubated for 18 h with 10 μg/ml LPS from E. coli, serotype 0111:B4 (Alexis Biochemicals, San Diego, CA). At 2 days after transfection, supernatants were collected and stored at −80 °C or used immediately for an IL-1β ELISA according to the manufacturer's protocol (R&D systems, Minneapolis, MN). Using the amino acid sequence of the caspase-1 prodomain as a query for BLASTn searches of the public data bases, we found a human EST clone (GenBank accession number AA070591) containing an open reading frame encoding a 97-amino acid protein predicted to share 92% sequence identity with the CARD of pro-caspase-1 (Fig. 1 A). The CARD region of COP (91 amino acids from its first amino acid) showed 97% identity to the CARD of pro-caspase-1. To confirm these results, cDNAs were amplified using specific primers from various adult human tissues and sequenced, revealing the same nucleotide sequence as the original EST, which shares 97% sequence identity at the nucleotide level with the prodomain region of pro-caspase-1 (Fig. 1 B). The start codon initiating the open reading frame in these cDNA clones resides in a favorable context for translation (24Kozak M. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1992; 8: 197-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar) and is preceded by an in-frame stop codon. The 3′-untranslated region contains TAAA and TATA motifs, typical of short-lived mRNAs that are subject to post-transcriptional regulation (25Jackle H. Sauer F. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1993; 5: 505-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), and a candidate polyadenylation signal sequence (AATAAA). The predicted protein contains a CARD (residues 1–91), which is followed by six amino acids and then a stop codon. Thus, this protein contains essentially only a CARD, prompting the moniker CARD-only protein (or COP). To determine the genomic organization of the COP gene, the COP cDNA nucleotide sequence was employed for searches of the High Throughput Genomic Sequence (HTGS) data base, resulting in identification of three genomic clones containing the COPgene (GenBankTM accessions numbers AC027011, AP001153, andAP002787). Comparison of the COP cDNA and genomic DNA sequences suggests a three exon structure, in which only the first two amino acids are encoded in exon 1 and only the last five residues are encoded in exon 3, such that most of the coding regions (including the entire CARD) are derived from exon 2. The introns separating exons 1, 2, and 3 are 631 and 844 base pairs in length, respectively, containing consensus dinucleotide splice donor (GT) and splice acceptor (AG) motifs (Fig. 1 C). The COP genomic clones identified in the HTGS data base have been mapped to human chromosome 11q22, which is the same chromosomal region where the PRO-CASPASE-1 gene resides, as well asPRO-CASPASE-4, PRO-CASPASE-5, and ICEBERG. To address the genomic localization of COP , PRO-CASPASE-4, PRO-CASPASE-5, and ICEBERG genes in chromosome 11, we searched the public data base of Human Genome Project Working Draft (genome.cse.ucsc.edu) and found that the order of these genes from centromere to telomere may be pro-caspase-4, pro-caspase-5, pro-caspase-1, COP , and ICEBERG (Fig. 1 D). This result also suggested that COP is a separate gene, presumably arising from duplication of other homologous genes in this locus. To study the expression ofCOP, Northern blot analysis was performed using RNA derived from several adult human tissues and a 0.57-kbp 32P-labeledCOP cDNA probe. Hybridizing bands of ∼0.6, 1.5, and 2.6 kbp were identified, with the 0.6-kbp band representing the most abundant of these transcripts and presumably corresponding to the fully spliced COP mRNA. The less abundant larger 1.5- and 2.6-kbp transcripts could represent unspliced precursors. However, based on previous reports (6Thornberry N.A. Bull H.G. Calaycay J.R. Chapman K.T. Howard A.D. Kostura M.J. Miller D.K. Molineaux S.M. Weidner J.R. Aunins J. Elliston K.O. Ayala J.M. Casano F.J. Chin J. Ding G.J.F. Egger L.A. Gaffney E.P. Limjuco G. Palyha O.C. Raju S.M. Rolando A.M. Salley J.P. Yamin T.T. Lee T.D. Shively J.E. MacCross M. Mumford R.A. Schmidt J.A. Tocci M.J. Nature. 1992; 356: 768-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (2232) Google Scholar), the 2.6-kbp mRNA also potentially could represent pro-caspase-1 mRNA resulting from probe cross-hybridization because of the 87% nucleotide sequence homology shared between the COP cDNA probe andpro-caspase-1. The 0.6-kbp COP mRNA was most abundant in spleen, followed by liver, placenta, and peripheral blood leukocytes. However, most tissues contain at least some detectable 0.6-kbp COPmRNA (Fig. 2 A). To corroborate the Northern blot analysis, we also analyzedCOP mRNA expression in adult human tissues by RT-PCR methods using COP-specific primers. Successful amplification of COP was confirmed by DNA sequencing of PCR products (not shown). The RT-PCR analysis showed that COP mRNA is expressed in all tissues analyzed except thymus (Fig. 2 B). Parallel RT-PCR analysis of β-actin mRNA served as a control. In general, the relative levels of COP mRNA detected by RT-PCR were in agreement with the Northern blot data (Fig. 2, A and B). The prodomain of pro-caspase-1 is required for dimerization and activation of this zymogen (26Criekinge W. Beyaert R. Van de Craen M. Vandenabeele P. Schotte P. De Valck D. Fiers W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27245-37248Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Because the prodomain of COP shares a high degree of amino acid sequence identity with the prodomain of caspase-1 (Fig. 1), we tested the possibility that COP interacts with pro-caspase-1 in co-immunoprecipitation assays. Interactions with several other CARD-containing proteins were also tested, including COP itself, RIP2, Bcl-10, cIAP1, cIAP2, and pro-caspase-9. For these experiments, 293T cells were transiently transfected with expression plasmids encoding either HA- or Myc-tagged COP in combination with various other expression plasmids producing either Myc- or FLAG-tagged CARD proteins. Immunoprecipitations were then performed with anti-Myc antibody, and the resulting immunocomplexes were analyzed by SDS-PAGE/immunoblotting using anti-HA or anti-FLAG antibody. Lysates derived from these transfected cells were also analyzed directly by immunoblotting as a control to verify production of each protein. Fig.3 shows selected representative results. HA-COP co-immunoprecipitated with Myc-COP, indicating that this protein can self-associate (Fig. 3 A). In addition, HA-COP co-immunoprecipitated with Myc-tagged pro-caspase-1 (C285A mutant) as well as with a fragment of pro-caspase-1 containing only its CARD-carrying prodomain (Fig. 3, B and C). Thus, COP binds pro-caspase-1 through its CARD domain. Note that the active site cysteine of pro-caspase-1 was mutated for these co-immunoprecipitation experiments to avoid induction of apoptosis, which can occur when this protease is over-expressed. Finally, Myc-COP co-immunoprecipitated with Flag-RIP2. In contrast, COP did not co-immunoprecipitate with the CARD-containing proteins Bcl-10, cIAP1, cIAP2, or pro-caspase-9 (Fig. 3 E and data not shown), thus demonstrating the specificity of these results. RIP2 has been shown to bind and activate caspase-1 through the interaction of their CARDs, resulting in oligomerization of pro-caspase-1 and its activation via the induced proximity mechanism (19Thome M. Hofmann K. Burns K. Martinon F. Bodmer J.L. Mattmann C. Tschopp J. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 885-888Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Salvesen G. Dixit V.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 10964-10967Crossref PubMed Scopus (773) Google Scholar). The data demonstrating that COP binds to both pro-caspase-1 and RIP2 therefore led us to hypothesize that COP might function as a modulator of RIP2-induced pro-caspase-1 oligomerization. We therefore performed experiments in which 293T cells were transiently transfected with expression plasmids encoding Myc-tagged pro-caspase-1 (C285A mutant) and HA-tagged pro-caspase-1 (C285A mutant), with or without Flag-tagged RIP2 and COP, and then monitored Myc-pro-caspase-1 and HA-pro-caspase-1 association by co-immunoprecipitation assays. As determined by this co-immunoprecipitation assay, pro-caspase-1 self-associated, and this was enhanced by co-expression of RIP2 (Fig.4 A). However, when COP was also co-expressed, this RIP2-mediated effect on pro-caspase-1 self-association was negated (Fig. 4 A). These findings suggested the possibility of a competitive mechanism in which COP competes with RIP2 for binding to pro-caspase-1. To test this hypothesis, therefore, transfection experiments were preformed in which Flag-RIP2 and Myc-tagged pro-caspase-1 (C285A mutant) were expressed in 293T cells in the presence of increasing amounts of HA-tagged COP. The effects of COP on association of RIP2 with pro-caspase-1 were then evaluated by co-immunoprecipitation assays in which immunoprecipitations were performed using anti-Flag antibody to recover Flag-RIP2 protein; the resulting immune-complexes were analyzed by SDS-PAGE/immunoblotting using anti-Myc antibody to detect associated Myc-pro-caspase-1. As shown in Fig. 4 B, COP inhibited association of pro-caspase-1 with RIP2 in a dose-dependent manner. Immunoblot analysis of lysates from these same cells demonstrated that COP did not affect the total levels of pro-caspase-1 or RIP2 but rather just their association. These results therefore confirm that COP can interfere with binding of pro-caspase-1 to RIP2. Active caspase-1 cleaves pro-IL-1β, resulting in the generation of bioactive IL-1β, which is secreted from cells (6Thornberry N.A. Bull H.G. Calaycay J.R. Chapman K.T. Howard A.D. Kostura M.J. Miller D.K. Molineaux S.M. Weidner J.R. Aunins J. Elliston K.O. Ayala J.M. Casano F.J. Chin J. Ding G.J.F. Egger L.A. Gaffney E.P. Limjuco G. Palyha O.C. Raju S.M. Rolando A.M. Salley J.P. Yamin T.T. Lee T.D. Shively J.E. MacCross M. Mumford R.A. Schmidt J.A. Tocci M.J. Nature. 1992; 356: 768-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (2232) Google Scholar). We hypothesized that COP could suppress caspase-1-induced pro-IL-1β processing and thus reduce secretion of IL-1β. To test this idea, a transient transfection assay was employed in which a mouse pro-IL-1β expression plasmid was co-transfected into COS-7, 293T, or 293HEK cells together with plasmids encoding wild-type human pro-caspase-1 alone or in combination with RIP2 and COP. At 2 days after transfection, secretion of mature murine IL-1β into the culture medium was quantified by ELISA. As shown in Fig. 5, co-expression of pro-caspase-1 and pro-IL-1β in COS-7 cells resulted in secretion of mature IL-1β ranging from 80 to 250 pg/ml, which was proportional to the amount of pro-caspase-1 plasmid used. This IL-1β secretion was enhanced by co-expression of RIP2 plasmid. In contrast, expression of COP together with pro-caspase-1, pro-IL-1β, and RIP2 resulted in a dose-dependent decrease in the amount of mature IL-1β secretion proportional to the amount of COP-encoding plasmid used. Similarly, in 293T and 293HEK cells, COP inhibited IL-1β secretion from cells transfected with pro-caspase-1 and RIP2 (data not shown). We also tested whether COP inhibits IL-1β secretion in the absence of RIP2 over-expression. For these experiments, plasmids encoding COP and pro-caspase-1 were co-transfected at various ratios. IL-1β secretion was compared with that of cells transfected with pro-caspase-1 alone (Fig. 5). Transfection of COP resulted in a dose-dependent decrease of IL-1β secretion. We infer therefore that COP is capable of suppressing the caspase-1-mediated secretion of IL-1β. The amounts of pro-IL-1β protein processed by caspase-1, however, were too small to be detected by immunoblotting, consistent with previous reports (6Thornberry N.A. Bull H.G. Calaycay J.R. Chapman K.T. Howard A.D. Kostura M.J. Miller D.K. Molineaux S.M. Weidner J.R. Aunins J. Elliston K.O. Ayala J.M. Casano F.J. Chin J. Ding G.J.F. Egger L.A. Gaffney E.P. Limjuco G. Palyha O.C. Raju S.M. Rolando A.M. Salley J.P. Yamin T.T. Lee T.D. Shively J.E. MacCross M. Mumford R.A. Schmidt J.A. Tocci M.J. Nature. 1992; 356: 768-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (2232) Google Scholar). To explore whether COP is capable of suppressing IL-1β production induced by a physiological pathway, we transfected HT1080 cells with TLR4, a receptor for LPS that is known to trigger caspase-1 activation, resulting in IL-1β secretion (27Wright S.D. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 189: 605-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig.6, TLR4 over-expression followed by LPS treatment resulted in mature IL-1β secretion from HT1080 cells, ranging from 10 to 20 pg/ml. However, co-expression of COP resulted in dose-dependent decreases in LPS-induced IL-1β secretion. We have described a new member of the human CARD-containing family of proteins, which we have termed COP. This presents the 16th human CARD protein described in the literature (excluding CARD-containing caspases) in addition to APAF1, NOD1 (CARD4), NOD2, NAC (DEPCAP), RAIDD (CRAIDD), RIP2 (CARDIAK; RICK), ARC (NOP), ASC, BCL-10 (huE10), ICEBERG, Ipaf1(CLAN), cIAP1, cIAP2, CARD9, CARD11, CARD12, and CARD13, and thus we also propose the alternative designation, CARD16, for this protein. COP (CARD16) consists essentially of only a CARD, having only 91 residues upstream and 6 residues downstream of this protein interaction domain. The CARD of COP shares 97% amino acid identity with the corresponding domain in pro-caspase-1. COP interacts with the prodomain of pro-caspase-1 and also with RIP2, a protein previously demonstrated to bind the prodomain of pro-caspase-1. COP seems to compete with RIP2 for binding to pro-caspase-1, thereby inhibiting RIP2-mediated caspase-1 oligomerization. Consequently, COP interferes with the ability of RIP2 to enhance caspase-1-induced secretion of mature IL-1β. Moreover, COP diminishes IL-1β secretion induced by LPS stimulation of TLR4, demonstrating that COP can regulate at least one pathway known to be physiologically important in pathogen responses. ICEBERG, another protein containing a CARD with striking homology to the prodomain of pro-caspase-1, shares the same mechanism of action in inhibiting pro-IL-1β processing induced by caspase-1 (21Humke E.W. Shriver S.K. Starovasnik M.A. Fairbrother W.J. Dixit V.M. Cell. 2000; 103: 99-111Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). In this regard, COP together with ICEBERG is likely to control IL-1β generation and thereby oppose IL-1β-induced inflammation. Interestingly, the genes encoding both COP and ICEBERG map to human chromosome 11q22 where the genes for caspases involved in inflammation (caspases 1, 4 and 5) also reside (28Nicholson D.W. Cell Death Differ. 1999; 6: 1028-1042Crossref PubMed Scopus (1306) Google Scholar). Thus, chromosome 11q22 contains a cluster of pro-inflammatory caspase genes and their inhibitors, which probably arose from exon and gene duplication events during evolution. Northern blot and RT-PCR assays revealed that COP is widely expressed in human tissues. Similarly, PRO-CASPASE-1mRNA is known to be expressed in multiple tissues, implying thatCOP and pro-caspase-1 may be constitutively co-expressed under normal conditions. Consequently, COP may be present as a counter-measure to pro-caspase-1, ensuring against adventitial activation of the pro-inflammatory caspase. It remains to be determined, however, whether the expression of COP increases in response to inflammatory signals, analogous recent evidence implies that levels of ICEBERG become elevated as a relatively late event following cytokine signal transduction, presumably for the purpose of down-regulating inflammatory responses (21Humke E.W. Shriver S.K. Starovasnik M.A. Fairbrother W.J. Dixit V.M. Cell. 2000; 103: 99-111Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). Several CARD-containing proteins are capable of regulating NF-κB induction, in addition to or instead of caspases, including NOD1, NOD2, CARDIAK, BCL-10, CARD-9, CARD-11, CARD-13, cIAP1, and cIAP2 (11Srinivasula S.M.

Although we observed that over-expression of COP can trigger NF-κB induction (not shown), the levels of NF-κB activity produced were only ∼10-fold above background and thus not of the same magnitude as that seen under the same experimental circumstances using physiological activators of NF-κB such as TRAFs, TNFR1, and Toll-like receptors (29Gilmore T.D. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6842-6844Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). We therefore speculate that NF-κB regulation is not a major function of COP. Similarly, although several CARD-containing proteins can either induce or suppress apoptosis (18Reed J.C. Am. J. Pathol. 2000; 157: 1415-1430Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 28Nicholson D.W. Cell Death Differ. 1999; 6: 1028-1042Crossref PubMed Scopus (1306) Google Scholar), we failed to find a significant role for COP in apoptosis regulation in pilot experiments (data not shown). These observations thus argue that the predominant role for COP is likely to be manifested in its capacity to function as a negative regulator of pro-caspase-1 activation. IL-1β plays a critical role in septic shock (1Dinarello C.A. Wolff S.M.N. N. Engl. J. Med. 1993; 328: 106-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (951) Google Scholar), which currently represents the most common cause of lethality in patients treated in the intensive care setting (30Natanson C. Hoffman W.D. Suffredini A.F. Eichacker P.Q. Danner R.L. Ann. Intern. Med. 1994; 120: 771-783Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar). Thus, maintenance of IL-1β homeostasis to prevent systemic inflammatory reactions is important for survival when challenged with Gram-negative bacteria or other inflammatory insults. It is perhaps not surprising therefore that several endogenous inhibitors of IL-1β have been identified, including IL-1 receptor antagonist, a soluble IL-1β-binding protein, ICEBERG, and now COP (2Arend W.P.

https://openalex.org/W2052079265,"Eukaryotic replication factor C is the heteropentameric complex that loads the replication clamp proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) onto primed DNA. In this study we used a derivative, designated RFC, with a N-terminal truncation of the Rfc1 subunit removing a DNA-binding domain not required for clamp loading. Interactions of yeast RFC with PCNA and DNA were studied by surface plasmon resonance. Binding of RFC to PCNA was stimulated by either adenosine (3-thiotriphosphate) (ATPγS) or ATP. RFC bound only to primer-template DNA coated with the single-stranded DNA-binding protein RPA if ATPγS was also present. Binding occurred without dissociation of RPA. ATP did not stimulate binding of RFC to DNA, suggesting that hydrolysis of ATP dissociated DNA-bound RFC. However, when RFC and PCNA together were flowed across the DNA chip in the presence of ATP, a signal was observed suggesting loading of PCNA by RFC. With ATPγS present instead of ATP, long-lived response signals were observed indicative of loading complexes arrested on the DNA. A primer with a 3′ single-stranded extension also allowed loading of PCNA; yet turnover of the reaction intermediates was dramatically slowed down. Filter binding experiments and analysis of proteins bound to DNA-magnetic beads confirmed the conclusions drawn from the surface plasmon resonance studies."

These results suggest that NO synthesis is a key determinant of flash control in fireflies."

In GluR-A–deficient mice, plasticity could be restored by controlled expression of green fluorescent protein (GFP)–tagged GluR-A, which contributes to channel formation and displayed the developmental redistribution of AMPA receptors in CA1 pyramidal neurons. Long-term potentiation (LTP) induced by pairing or tetanic stimulation was rescued in adult GluR-A –/– mice when GFP GluR-A expression was constitutive or induced in already fully developed pyramidal cells.

In the phage T4 system, four ATP molecules bind to the clamp loader gp44/62 (1Latham G.J. Pietroni P. Dong F. Young M.C. von Hippel P.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 264: 426-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 2Sexton D.J. Kaboord B.F. Berdis A.J. Carver T.E. Benkovic S.J. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 7749-7756Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). This activated complex interacts with the replication clamp gp45, resulting in the hydrolysis of two ATP molecules. Upon contacting DNA, the clamp is loaded, the remaining two ATP molecules bound to the gp44/62 complex are hydrolyzed, and the clamp loader is released from the DNA-gp45 complex. In E. coli, a similar mechanism prevails, involving the binding of only two molecules of ATP per clamp loader complex, which after loading of the clamp hydrolyze sequentially with release of the clamp loader from the DNA (3Turner J. Hingorani M.M. Kelman Z. O'Donnell M. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 771-783Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 4Hingorani M.M. Bloom L.B. Goodman M.F. O'Donnell M. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5131-5144Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Studies of the role of ATP in the function of eukaryotic RFC have established, first, that RFC forms a strong complex with the replication clamp PCNA when either ATP or the nonhydrolyzable analog ATPγS is present (5Gerik K.J.

Burgers P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 276: 34768-34775Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Although the studies with human RFC are less straightforward because of the presence of the ligase homology domain, which also binds DNA (7Fotedar R. Mossi R. Fitzgerald P. Rousselle T. Maga G.

Finally, although ATP hydrolysis is required for effective loading of PCNA by RFC, ATPγS also promotes loading of PCNA although in an inactive form (6Gomes X.V. Burgers P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 276: 34768-34775Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 11Burgers P.M.J. J. Biol.

However, under some conditions, particularly by removal of excess ATPγS through gel filtration, this loaded PCNA can function, albeit inefficiently, as a processivity factor for DNA polymerase δ (11Burgers P.M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 22698-22706Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Lee S.H. Hurwitz J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 5672-5676Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar) (Scheme FSI). Because RFC can form distinct ATP-dependent complexes with PCNA as well as with DNA, the question arises which of these two complexes is an intermediate on the clamp loading pathway as outlined in Scheme FSI. Current models of eukaryotic clamp loading favor a pathway via steps 2 and 4, assigning a function to a RFC·DNA complex prior to its interaction with PCNA (15Waga S. Stillman B. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 721-751Crossref PubMed Scopus (659) Google Scholar). However, our observation that ATP does not allow stable binding of RFC to DNA, presumably because its hydrolysis rapidly dissociates the RFC·DNA complex, makes it less likely that the latter complex functions as an intermediate in the loading of PCNA. Rather, a complex between PCNA and RFC may be the first step in clamp loading proceeding via steps 1 and 3, which is analogous to the prokaryotic clamp loading systems. In this paper we determine how many ATP molecules participate in clamp loading and at what step in the overall pathway they enter the complex. Furthermore, we show that clamp loading is a sequential ordered process in which PCNA binding to RFC precedes that of DNA. Pol δ was purified as described (16Burgers P.M. Methods. 1999; 18: 349-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). All other enzymes were as described in the first paper. (6Gomes X.V. Burgers P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 276: 34768-34775Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (112) Google Scholar). The 80-mer template was designated V6 (5′-T30CTCCCTTCTTCTCCTCCCTCTCCCTTCCCT21-Biotin), and the 30-mer primer was designated C12 (5′-AGGGAAGGGAGAGGGAGGAGAAGAAGGGAG). [35S]ATPγS was obtained from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, and cold ATPγS was fromRoche Molecular Biochemicals. The radioactive ATPγS (500 μCi) was mixed with an about 10-fold molar excess of cold ATPγS and purified over a 0.5-ml MonoQ column using a 5-ml gradient of 50–500 mm NaCl in 30 mm Hepes-NaOH, pH 7.5, 5 mm dithiothreitol. The concentration of ATPγS in the peak fractions was determined spectrophotometrically, and the aliquots were stored at −70 °C. A thin layer chromatographic analysis of the peak fractions indicated a radiochemical purity of >98%. Cold ATPγS was purified and stored similarly. Buffer A contained 30 mm Hepes-NaOH, pH 7.5, 0.5 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 10 mm magnesium acetate, 5 mmdithiothreitol, 0.1% ampholytes 3.5–10, and 0.01% Nonidet P40. Buffer B contained buffer A with 0.2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. Salt concentrations of the buffers (in mm NaCl) are indicated with a subscript. Whatman nitrocellulose filters (0.2 μm) were treated for 10 min with 0.4m KOH and then equilibrated in buffer A75(without dithiothreitol). Binding reactions were carried out in buffer B75 in a final volume of 20 μl containing 0.2 μm RFC and increasing concentrations of [35S]ATPγS. PCNA (0.3 μm as trimers), DNA (0.3 μm V6, C12, or V6/C12), and RPA (0.6 μm) were added to the binding reaction where indicated. After an incubation at 0 °C for 45 s, a 15-μl aliquot was filtered at ∼50 μl/min over a nitrocellulose filter, and the filter was washed at ∼0.5 ml/min with 150 μl of buffer A75. After air drying of the filter, a water-miscible counting fluid was added, and the samples were counted in a scintillation counter. Several precautionary measures were taken, and several controls were carried out to ensure that the binding experiments properly measured stoichiometry of binding: (i) RFC was filtered over a 0.1 μm filter prior to use in order to remove aggregated inactive material (17Gomes X.V. Gary S.L. Burgers P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14541-14549Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar); (ii) ATPγS and [35S]ATPγS were purified to radiochemical and chromatographic homogeneity prior to use (see above); (iii) control filter binding assays were carried out with RFC, and the material flowing though the nitrocellulose filter was analyzed by a Western analysis to quantitate RFC passing though the filter; over 98% of the RFC remained on the filter (data not shown); (iv) different conditions were assayed to establish optimal binding of ATPγS to RFC; nucleotide binding was insensitive to salt concentrations between 50 and 125 mm NaCl and to incubation times between 30 s and 120 s prior to filtration; binding was also independent of the pH of the binding buffer between 7.3 and 8.1, but decreased binding was observed at pH 6.8 and below; and (v) by far the largest decrease in signal was observed during the wash steps; this signal loss was unrelated to background binding of ATPγS to the filter which was determined in separate experiments and which was in general 1–5% of the signal; by carrying out an increasing number of wash steps, the loss of signal per wash could be determined. A single wash step reduced the RFC-ATPγS or RFC·PCNA·ATPγS signal by 17% and reduced the RFC-DNA-ATPγS and RFC·PCNA·DNA·ATPγS signal by 11%; therefore, a single wash was carried out and, after background subtraction, the data were corrected for the loss of signal because of this wash step. 20-μl assays were performed in buffer B75 containing 20 ng of RFC (0.1 pmol), PCNA (0.2 pmol of trimers), 100 ng of multiply primed single-stranded mp18 DNA (∼5 primers/circle, ∼0.2 pmol of primer-template termini), 850 ng ofE. coli single-stranded binding protein, and a range of [α-32P]ATP concentrations for determiningKm and kcat. The reactions were incubated at 30 °C, and after 2, 4, and 6 min, 5-μl aliquots were removed, quenched with 2.5 μl of 50 mm EDTA, 1% SDS, and 25 mm cold ATP and ADP, and processed for analysis (6Gomes X.V. Burgers P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 276: 34768-34775Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Initial rates were calculated from each time course and plotted against the ATP concentration. RFC (0.2 pmol), PCNA (1 pmol), and Pol δ (0.5 pmol) were incubated in a final volume of 4 μl in buffer B75 containing increasing concentrations of ATP from 0 to 1 mm. After 60 s at 0 °C, a 2-μl aliquot was added to a 98-μl replication reaction equilibrated at 30 °C and containing 40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 8 mm MgAc2, 0.2 mg/ml of bovine serum albumin, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 100 μm each of dCTP and dGTP, 50 μm of dAMP-PNP, 25 μm of [3H]dTTP (1000 cpm/pmol dTTP), 0.2 pmol of singly primed single-stranded mp18 DNA (the 36-mer primer is complementary to nucleotides 6330–6295), 2 μg of E. coli single-stranded binding protein, 75 mm NaCl, and either no ATP or increasing concentrations of ATP. After 60 s at 30 °C, the reaction was stopped, and the acid-precipitable radioactivity was determined. In a second set of assays, RFC (0.1 pmol) and Pol δ (0.2 pmol) were preincubated with 0.2 pmol of singly primed single-stranded mp18 DNA,E. coli single-stranded binding protein (2 μg), and 100 μm dCTP in a final volume of 12 μl in buffer B75 containing increasing concentrations of ATP from 0 to 1 mm. The dCTP was added to prevent exonucleolytic degradation of the primer by the 3′-5′-exonuclease activity of Pol δ. After 60 s at 0 °C, a 10-μl aliquot was added to a 90-μl replication reaction equilibrated at 30 °C and containing 40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 8 mm MgAc2, 0.2 mg/ml of bovine serum albumin, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 100 μm each dCTP and dGTP, 50 μm dAMP-PNP, 25 μm [3H]dTTP (1000 cpm/pmol dTTP), 1 pmol of PCNA, 75 mm NaCl, and either no ATP or increasing concentrations of ATP. After 60 s at 30 °C, the reaction was stopped, and the acid-precipitable radioactivity was determined. To asses whether ATPγS could substitute for ATP in either the first or the second stage of the reaction, the first set of assays was repeated with the following modifications. RFC and PCNA were preincubated with 20 μm of ATP as described above and then diluted 50-fold into a replication reaction containing primed mp18 DNA and 0.25 pmol of Pol δ and either 100 μm ATP or 100 μm ATPγS. DNA synthesis after 60 s was quantitated. Next, RFC and PCNA were preincubated with 10 μm of ATP, 10 μm of ATPγS, or no nucleotide as described above and then diluted 50-fold into a replication reaction containing primed mp18 DNA, 0.25 pmol of Pol δ, and 100 μm ATP. DNA synthesis after 30 s was quantitated. In both assays, dAMP-PNP was used as a dATP analog that is readily incorporated into DNA by Pol δ but that, because of the β-γ-imido bond, is unable to load PCNA (11Burgers P.M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 22698-22706Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). SPR was performed in a BIAcore X apparatus. Buffer B125 was the running buffer used in the analysis. The DNA and PCNA chips used in these studies are described in the previous paper (6Gomes X.V. Burgers P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 276: 34768-34775Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Because of the limited lifetime of the chips, several chips had to be made that had slightly different loading densities. As a result, minor quantitative differences in binding were observed from chip to chip, and, therefore, the absolute responses (as resonance units) cannot be compared from experiment to experiment. However, a single series of experiments was always carried out with the same chip. ATPγS is an ATP analog that has been very useful in biochemical studies because its binding affinity to ATPases is similar to that of ATP, but frequently hydrolysis of the analog is not observed (for a review see Ref. 18Eckstein F. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1985; 54: 367-402Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Control studies showed that ATPγS is not hydrolyzed by RFC with or without DNA and/or PCNA present (data not shown). Early studies have shown that ATPγS is a potent inhibitor of both the ATPase activity of RFC and the productive loading of PCNA by RFC, suggesting efficient binding of ATPγS to RFC (11Burgers P.M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 22698-22706Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Lee S.H. Hurwitz J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 5672-5676Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar, 19Yoder B.L. Burgers P.M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 22689-22697Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Tsurimoto T. Stillman B. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 1961-1968Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, previous studies that measured the binding affinities of ATP and ATPγS for RFC in an indirect fashion showed no significant differences between the two nucleotides (5Gerik K.J. Gary S.L. Burgers P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1256-1262Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). However, implicit in our studies remains the assumption that fundamentally contrasting results with ATP and ATPγS as cofactors derive in essence from the inability of ATPγS to undergo hydrolysis. The binding data of ATPγS to RFC could be fitted to a Langmuir binding curve with a single KD value of 0.25 μm and a stoichiometry at saturation of 1.78 molecules of ATPγS bound per molecule of RFC (Fig.1 A). We interpret this to indicate that two molecules of ATPγS can bind to RFC alone and that a small fraction of the RFC may be inactive and fail to bind the nucleotide. Surprisingly, in the presence of PCNA, three molecules of ATPγS (actual value of 2.58) were bound with a very similarKD value of 0.23 μm. Similarly, three ATPγS molecules (actual value of 2.64) were bound to RFC when primer-template DNA was present; however, the KDvalue was significantly higher at 0.41 μm. Finally, four molecules of ATPγS (actual value of 3.60) bound RFC with aKD of 0.35 μm when both PCNA and DNA were present. Assuming 11% of RFC to be inactive, calculated occupancy values at saturation of 1.78 (RFC alone), 2.58 (RFC+PCNA), 2.64 (RFC+DNA), and 3.60 (RFC+PCNA+DNA) molecules of ATPγS recalculate to a 2.0:2.9:3.0:4.0 ratio, which we consider highly significant evidence for binding by two, three, three, and four molecules, respectively. The data in Fig. 1 A have been fitted to single Langmuir binding curves with all binding sites identical in affinity for ATPγS. However, particularly the data for ATPγS binding to RFC in the presence of DNA fit equally well to a model in which the affinity of the first two sites has been set to 0.25 μm, which is identical to those measured in the absence of DNA and that of the third site to 2 μm (Fig. 1 B). Similarly, binding of the four ATPγS molecules to RFC with both PCNA and DNA present could just as reliably be modeled with three high affinity binding sites (0.23 μm) and one low affinity binding site (2 μm). The nature of the DNA effector required to induce binding of an additional molecule of ATPγS was investigated in more detail. The data were obtained at a single concentration of ATPγS of 2.5 μm. Because the ATPγS concentration was below saturation, the measured stoichiometries were lower than those in Fig.1. They were recalculated to the nearest integer value using this consideration and those described above (see caption to TableI). The 80-mer oligonucleotide V6, which was used as template, induced binding of a third molecule of ATPγS, and a fourth molecule if PCNA was also present (Table I, entry 2). However, if this single-stranded DNA was first coated with RPA, no binding of an additional molecule of ATPγS was induced. Previously, we had shown by SPR that binding of RFC to this 80-mer was observed but that binding was abolished when the DNA was coated with RPA (6Gomes X.V. Burgers P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 276: 34768-34775Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (112) Google Scholar). The 80-mer V6 (T30CTCCCTTCTTCTCCTCCCTCTCCCTTCCCT21) was designed such that significant secondary structure would not be present. Therefore, it appears that binding of RFC to DNAper se, regardless of its structure, may trigger a conformational change that allows binding of an additional molecule of ATPγS. RPA did not affect how primer-template DNA induced binding of ATPγS (Table I, entries 5 and 6). In agreement with previous results showing that PCNA could be loaded onto forked primer-templates, the presence of a 3′ single-stranded extension on the primer did not affect binding of ATPγS (6Gomes X.V. Burgers P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 276: 34768-34775Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (112) Google Scholar).Table IBinding of ATPγS to RFC in the presence of different DNA effectorsEntryDNARPAATPγS boundNumber of ATPs boundRFCRFC + PCNARFCRFC + PCNA1NoneNo1.62.4232TemplateNo2.13.0343TemplateYes1.62.4234PrimerYes1.52.4235Base-pairedNo2.33.1346Base-pairedYes2.43.1347ForkedYes2.43.234All binding assays were carried out as described under “Experimental Procedures,” but at a single concentration of 2.5 μm ATPγS.

Except for entries 2 and 5, the DNA was coated with a 3-fold molar excess of RPA prior to binding of RFC. Binding experiments were done in triplicate, and the estimated errors were 5%.

Open table in a new tab All binding assays were carried out as described under “Experimental Procedures,” but at a single concentration of 2.5 μm ATPγS.

Previously we have shown that ATP or ATPγS stabilizes a complex between RFC and PCNA, and ATPγS stabilizes a complex between RFC and DNA. SPR has allowed us to monitor the formation of such complexes and their dissociation in real time (6Gomes X.V. Burgers P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 276: 34768-34775Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (112) Google Scholar). RFC binding to a PCNA chip is greatly stimulated by ATP or ATPγS. At saturating ATP concentrations the extent of steady state binding of RFC to a PCNA chip is a sole function of both the RFC concentration and theKD value of RFC for PCNA. At subsaturating levels of ATP, steady state binding is additionally dependent on theKD value of ATP for RFC, yielding a more complex relationship. However, the linear initial rate of binding to the chip is only dependent on the concentration of active complexes,i.e. those RFC molecules that have the required number of ATP molecules bound to form a high affinity complex with PCNA on the chip. Therefore, by varying the ATP concentration at a constant concentration of RFC, the apparent KD for binding of the ATP molecule critical for strong complex formation can be determined from the initial binding rates. Both ATP and ATPγS yielded similar apparent KD values of 0.5 μm(Fig. 2 A), which are comparable with those determined previously using PCNA-agarose beads (5Gerik K.J. Gary S.L. Burgers P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1256-1262Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). ATPγS was required to observe a RFC·DNA complex by SPR when the DNA was attached to the chip and coated with RPA (6Gomes X.V. Burgers P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 276: 34768-34775Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (112) Google Scholar). A plot of the linear initial rates of binding of RFC to the DNA chip as a function of the ATPγS concentration yielded an apparent KD value of 8 μm for ATPγS, indicating that the lowest affinity ATP-binding site required for the formation of a detectable DNA-RFC complex has a KD value of 8 μm (Fig.2 B). Whether other higher affinity binding sites for ATP exist does not follow from this indirect analysis but is suggested by the direct nucleotide binding experiments in Fig. 1. Loading of PCNA by RFC onto the primed DNA chip proceeds efficiently in the presence of ATPγS, but some final step in this process fails to occur because of the absence of hydrolysis of the bound ATP (6Gomes X.V. Burgers P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 276: 34768-34775Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Remarkably, analysis of the initial rates of PCNA loading by RFC as a function of the ATPγS concentration yielded an apparentKD value of 1.5 μm (Fig.2 B). This apparent KD value is substantially lower than that required for complex formation between RFC and DNA in the absence of PCNA. Thus, ATP-mediated binding of PCNA to RFC allows complex formation with primed DNA at a lower ATP concentration than DNA-RFC complex formation without PCNA. Previous attempts to determine the steady state ATPase parameters for yeast RFC were complicated by the extreme lability of the enzyme (19Yoder B.L. Burgers P.M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 22689-22697Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, with a more stable enzyme available (17Gomes X.V. Gary S.L. Burgers P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14541-14549Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), the ATPase kinetics were reexamined. RFC has a basal ATPase activity that is stimulated 2-fold by PCNA (Fig.3 A). The presence of primed DNA stimulated the ATPase much more dramatically, and a synergistic increase was observed when both PCNA and DNA were present (Fig.3 B). Interestingly, the Km values for all types of ATPase activities, except for the DNA-stimulated ATPase, were significantly higher than the associated KD values measured with ATPγS (Table II). These data may suggest that ATPγS binds to one or more of the available binding sites in RFC with severalfold higher affinity than ATP does. Alternatively, the simple assumption that Km =KD may not hold in this complex system.Table IIKD and KM values (in μm) for ATP and ATPγS in RFC-PCNA and RFC-DNA interactionsComponentsFilter bindingSPRKm ATPaseATPγSATPATPγSATPRFC0.253RFC + PCNA0.230.50.51.5RFC + DNA0.41 or 2 × 0.25 + 1 × 2–89.7RFC + PCNA + DNA0.41 or 3 × 0.23 + 1 × 2–1.58.4 Open table in a new tab The ATPγS binding studies indicate that in the presence of either PCNA or DNA three ATP molecules are bound to RFC, but when both DNA and PCNA are present, a fourth molecule is bound (Fig. 1). Two complimentary sets of experiments were carried out to determine whether the three ATPs in either complex would suffice to complete the loading reaction upon addition of the final required component, i.e. DNA to a PCNA·RFC·ATP3 complex or PCNA to a DNA·RFC·ATP3 complex (see flow diagrams in Fig.4). In these assays, PCNA loading was assessed indirectly by measuring processive DNA replication by Pol δ, which is dependent on appropriately loaded PCNA. In the first set of experiments, a control experiment was carried out in which RFC, PCNA, and Pol δ were preincubated together in buffer without ATP and then diluted 50-fold into a replication assay mix containing DNA and increasing ATP. This assay yielded a K 12 value of 4.5 μm for ATP in the overall loading reaction (Fig.4 A). In the experiment, RFC, PCNA, and Pol δ were preincubated with increasing ATP concentrations, and this preincubation mixture was diluted 50-fold into a replication reaction containing DNA, but no additional ATP. If the three ATPs prebound to the PCNA-RFC complex would suffice to bind DNA and complete the loading reaction, then an apparent K 12 in the low μmrange should be observed. Yet half-maximal activation was only observed when 210 μm ATP was present in the preincubation reaction, corresponding to a final concentration of 4.2 μm ATP after 50-fold dilution of the nucleotide into the assay. The same results were obtained when Pol δ was added to the replication assay rather than the preincubation reaction (data not shown). These results suggest either that complex formation between RFC and DNA has to precede PCNA entry into the complex or that after DNA binding, a fourth ATP molecule has to be bound to the DNA·PCNA·RFC·ATP3 complex to complete loading. In the second set of experiments the opposite question was asked,i.e. whether a DNA·RFC·ATP3 complex could complete loading by addition of PCNA without additional ATP. Again, in the control experiment when the preincubation contained no ATP, half-maximal activity r"

Deficiency of LPL in humans (Type I hyperlipoproteinemia) is associated with massive chylomicronemia, low high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels, and recurrent attacks of pancreatitis when not controlled by a strict diet. In contrast to humans, homozygous LPL knock-out mice (L0) do not survive suckling and die between 18 and 24 h after birth. In this study, an adenovirus-based protocol was utilized for the transient expression of LPL during the suckling period in an effort to rescue L0 mice. After a single intraperitoneal injection of 5×109 plaque-forming units of LPL-expressing virus immediately after birth, more than 90% of L0 mice survived the first days of life. 3% of L0 mice survived the entire suckling period and lived for up to 20 months, although LPL activity in mouse tissues and postheparin plasma was undetectable in all animals after 6 weeks of age. Adult LPL-deficient mice were smaller than their littermates until 2–3 months of age and exhibited very high triglyceride levels in the fed (4997 ± 1102 versus 113.4 ± 18.7 mg/dl) and fasted state (2007 ± 375 versus 65.5 ± 7.4 mg/dl). Plasma total cholesterol levels, free fatty acids, and ketone bodies were elevated in L0 mice, whereas plasma glucose was normal. Most strikingly, L0 mice lacked apoA-I-containing preβ-HDL particles as well as mature HDL resulting in undetectable HDL cholesterol and HDL-apoA-I levels. HDL deficiency in plasma was evident despite normal apoA-I mRNA levels in the liver and normal apoA-I protein levels in plasma, which were predominantly found in the chylomicron fraction. The absence of preβ-HDL and mature HDL particles supports the concept that the lipolysis of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins is an essential step for HDL maturation.

Following its synthesis in parenchymal cells such as adipocytes and muscle cells, the enzyme is translocated and bound to the intimal side of the capillary endothelium by its interaction with sulfated glucosaminoglycans (for a review, see Refs. 1Goldberg I.J.

Lipid Res. 1974; 15: 263-272Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Besides this important enzymatic function, LPL has also been shown to act as a ligand or bridging factor for the receptor-mediated cellular uptake of various lipoproteins (6Eisenberg S. Sehayek E.

Both enzymatic and nonenzymatic LPL-mediated processes greatly affect the metabolism of plasma lipoproteins and energy homeostasis in all vertebrates. LPL deficiency (type I hyperlipoproteinemia) (12Brunzell J.D. Scriver R.S. Beaudet A.L. Sly W.S. Valli D. The Metabolic Basis of Inherited Desease. McGraw-Hill Inc., New York1989: 1165-1180Google Scholar) is a rare autosomal, recessively inherited disease characterized by elevated plasma TG levels, low plasma total cholesterol (TC) levels, and drastically decreased HDL cholesterol (HDL-C) concentrations. Besides these lipid abnormalities, the disorder is associated with the development of hepato- and splenomegaly, eruptive xanthomas, lipemia retinalis, and abdominal pain on a standard diet, which leads to frequent attacks of pancreatitis. The profoundly reduced HDL-C levels in LPL-deficient individuals are based on the role of LPL in HDL biogenesis. In this multistep process, lipid-poor or lipid-free HDL precursors (pre-β-HDL and apoA-I, respectively) are produced and secreted by hepatocytes or enterocytes. Alternatively, these particles are also produced by the LPL-mediated lipolysis of chylomicrons and VLDL or the HDL modification by phospholipid transfer protein (PLTP) and cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) (13Barrans A. Jaspard B. Barbaras R. Chap H. Perret B. Collet X. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1300: 73-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 14Rye K.A. Clay M.A. Barter P.J.

HDL precursor particles accept phospholipids and cholesterol from cells through an efflux mechanism that involves the ATP binding cassette transporter 1 (ABC1) (15Oram J.F. Vaughan A.M. Curr. Opin.

Subsequently, these particles are converted into mature, large, and spherical HDL-3 and HDL-2 by a process that involves the esterification of cholesterol by lecithin:cholesterol acyltransferase (19Santamarina-Fojo S. Lambert G. Hoeg J.M. Brewer Jr., H.B. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 2000; 11: 267-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), the acceptance of surface remnants from TG-rich lipoproteins (20Eisenberg S. J. Lipid Res. 1984; 25: 1017-1058Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the fusion of HDL particles. The latter two processes are mediated by PLTP (21Huuskonen J. Ehnholm C. Curr. Opin.

Invest. 1999; 103: 907-914Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). According to this pathway, the lack of TG lipolysis in LPL-deficient individuals impairs the generation of HDL precursors and prevents their maturation. More indirectly, the pronounced hypertriglyceridemia observed in these patients additionally results in an enhanced exchange of cholesteryl esters from HDL to VLDL, which thereby also contributes to low HDL-C levels. Homozygous LPL knock-out mice (L0) die shortly after birth (23Coleman T. Seip R.L. Gimble J.M. Lee D. Maeda N. Semenkovich C.F. J. Biol.

Science. 1983; 221: 167-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). At birth, these animals have elevated TG and TC levels compared with normal mice. Upon suckling, they become pale, develop severe hypertriglyceridemia due to chylomicron and VLDL accumulation, and die postnatally between 18 and 24 h. Although the exact cause of death has not been elucidated, it is conceivable that the enormous accumulation of large TG-rich lipoproteins in plasma leads to a defective gas exchange in lung capillaries, which causes insufficient oxygen supply, cyanosis, and premature death. Alternatively, an extremely low plasma glucose concentration in newborn L0 animals has also been proposed as a potential cause of death (26Merkel M. Weinstock P.H. Chajek-Shaul T. Radner H. Yin B.

These results suggested that the site of LPL expression is not essential for survival as long as a sufficient amount of the enzyme is present to control excessive TG accumulation and plasma glucose concentrations. In the current investigation, we rescued L0 mice by the transient expression of LPL during the suckling period. The lack of HDL particles in adult LPL-deficient mice indicated that the presence of LPL is essential for the production of mature plasma HDL, which represents the major lipoprotein class in the mouse. The recombinant adenovirus coding for human LPL was prepared by cotransfection of pAvCvSv (30Kobayashi K. Oka K. Forte T. Ishida B. Teng B. Ishimura-Oka K. Nakamuta M. Chan L. J. Biol.

Virology. 1988; 163: 614-617Crossref PubMed Scopus (550) Google Scholar) into 293 cells. The 1.6-kilobase pair BamHI-KpnI human LPL cDNA fragment was subcloned into BglII-KpnI-digested pAvCvSv. The resulting shuttle plasmid (5 μg) was cotransfected with 5 μg of pJM 17 into 293 cells using the calcium phosphate coprecipitation method (32Graham F.L. van der Eb A.J. Virology. 1973; 52: 456-567Crossref PubMed Scopus (6498) Google Scholar). 2 weeks after transfection, recombinant plaques were picked and propagated on 293 cells followed by the screening for LPL enzyme activity. Positive clones were subcloned twice more by plaque assay on 293 cells, and large scale production of high titer recombinant adenovirus was performed as described (33Teng B. Blumenthal S. Forte T. Navaratnam N. Scott J. Gotto Jr., A.M. Chan L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29395-29404Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Interbreeding of heterozygous LPL knock-out mice (L1) resulted in progeny of the following genotypes: 25% L2 (wild type), 50% L1, and 25% homozygous LPL knock-out mice (L0). All offspring were injected with different concentrations of Ad-LPL in 0.9% NaCl intraperitoneally immediately after birth to determine the optimal dose. Genotypes were examined after weaning from tail tip DNA by PCR analysis as reported previously (24Weinstock P.H. Bisgaier C.L. Aalto-Setälä K. Radner H. Ramakrishnan R. Levak-Frank S. Essenburg A.D. Zechner R. Breslow J.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 2555-2568Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). After weaning the mice were kept on low fat diet (2.5% fat). All animals from three L1 × L1 matings were weighed at the age of 3, 5, 7, 12, 14, and 21 days after birth, respectively. After weaning, mice were weighed repeatedly at the age of 30, 40, 50, 60, and 80 days. Postheparin plasma (PHP) from fed animals was collected from the retro-orbital plexus 20 min after the intraperitoneal injection of 1000 units of heparin/kg body weight. The LPL activity was determined in PHP according to an established method (34Zechner R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1044: 20-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Additionally, a monoclonal antibody (5D2) was used to inhibit specifically human LPL activity (kindly provided by Dr. J. Brunzell, Seattle) (35Chang S.F. Reich B. Brunzell J.D. Will H. J. Lipid Res. 1998; 39: 2350-2359Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). LPL and HL activities were expressed as μmol of FFA/ml/h. LPL and HL activities were also measured in preheparin plasma of fed animals. Blood was collected in the morning from fed as well as fasted animals (at least 10 h of nighttime fasting) by retroorbital bleeding. TC, HDL-C, and TG levels were analyzed enzymatically using commercial kits (Sigma). Lipoproteins were isolated by fast protein liquid chromatography (FPLC) using an Amersham Pharmacia Biotech system and a Superose 6 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Plasma samples were centrifuged 20 min at 13,000 rpm to remove the majority of chylomicrons. Chylomicron-depleted fractions (250 μl) were applied to FPLC analysis and eluted with 10 mm Tris-HCl, 1 mm EDTA, 154 mmNaCl, and 0.02% NaN3 (pH 7.4). Fractions of 0.5 ml each were collected and enzymatically assayed for cholesterol content. One major lipoprotein peak was identified corresponding to mouse VLDL/chylomicron remnants, and a second smaller peak corresponded to HDL. Low density lipoprotein concentrations were too low to be detected by the FPLC analysis. Plasma samples were analyzed for their contents of preβ-LpA-I and α-LpA-I by nondenaturating two-dimensional polyacrylamide gradient gel electrophoresis. Agarose gel electrophoresis, polyacrylamide gradient gel electrophoresis, and immunoblotting were performed as described previously (36Lee M. von Eckardstein A. Lindstedt S. Assmann G. Kovanen P.T. Atherioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1999; 19: 1066-1074Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Briefly, in the first dimension, 40 μl of plasma samples were separated by electrophoresis at 4 °C in a 0.75% agarose gel using a 50 mm merbital buffer (pH 8.7, Serva, Heidelberg, FRG). Bromphenol blue was added to a standard sample to visualize albumin in the native gel. The electrophoresis was stopped when the albumin/bromphenol blue marker had migrated 6 cm. Agarose gel strips containing the preseparated lipoproteins were then transferred to a 3–20% polyacrylamide gradient gel. Separation in the second dimension was performed at 40 mA for 4–5 h at 10 °C. The endogenous plasma albumin was visualized by the addition of bromphenol blue to the cathodic buffer (300 μl/liter of buffer). Electrophoresis in the second dimension was stopped when this band had migrated 10 cm. The proteins separated in the polyacrylamide gradient gel electrophoresis gel were electroblotted onto a nitrocellulose membrane, which was then incubated with biotinylated sheep antibodies against human apoA-I (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The apoA-I-antibody complexes were visualized by autoradiography after incubation with a streptavidin-biotinylated horseradish peroxidase complex (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and a chemiluminescent blotting substrate (Lumilight Plus System; Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Livers were removed surgically, weighed, and subsequently frozen in liquid nitrogen. 500 mg of wet tissue were finally homogenized in 5 ml of TRI Reagent (MRC, Karlsruhe, Germany). Total tissue RNA was precipitated with isopropyl alcohol. After centrifugation, the RNA pellet was washed with 75% ethanol, recentrifuged, and dissolved in diethyl pyrocarbonate-treated H2O. For Northern blot analysis, 10 μg of total RNA were separated by 1% formaldehyde-agarose gel electrophoresis and blotted overnight onto nylon membranes (Hybond N+; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Subsequently, the RNA was cross-linked to the membrane by ultraviolet irradiation. Blots were prehybridized for 4 h at 65 °C in a buffer containing 0.15m sodium phosphate (pH 7.2), 1 mm EDTA, 7% SDS, and 1% bovine serum albumin. Membranes were hybridized in the same buffer at 65 °C overnight with a specific mouse apoA-I cDNA probe. After hybridization, the blots were washed in 2× SSC and 0.1% SDS for 20 min at room temperature, followed by two additional washing steps in 1× SSC and 0.1% SDS for 10 min at 65 °C each. Specific hybridization was visualized by 3-h exposure to a PhosporImager Screen (Apbiotech, Freiburg, Germany). The mouse-specific apoA-I cDNA probe was generated by reverse transcription-PCR from isolated mouse liver mRNA using the Advantage RT-for-PCR Kit (CLONTECH). A 665-base pair PCR product was amplified with the forward primer GCACGTATGGCAGCAAGATG and the reverse primer GCATCAGACTATGGCGCAGG. This apoA-I cDNA fragment was inserted into the TA-cloning vector pSTblue (Novagen). The final clone was radioactively labeled with [32P]dCTP (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) using a random priming kit (Prime-a-Gene Kit; Promega, Mannheim, Germany). Blood was collected from retroorbital plexus, and lipoprotein fractions were isolated by sequential ultracentrifugation as described previously (37Schumaker V.N. Puppione D.L. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 128: 155-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar). Samples were mixed 1:1 with loading buffer (20% (w/v) glycerol, 5% (w/v) SDS, 0.15% (w/v) bromphenol blue, 63 mmol/liter Tris-HCl, pH 6.8), incubated for 10 min at 95 °C, and fractionated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (10% for apoA-I, 15% for apoA-II) for 1.5 h at 150 V and transferred to nitrocellulose by conventional blotting procedures. Specific bands were visualized by an ECL assay (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) after incubation with rabbit anti-mouse apoA-I or apoA-II antibody (Biodesign, dilution 1:2000). As a second antibody, horseradish peroxidase-labeled mouse anti-rabbit antiserum was used (dilution 1:1000; Sigma). ApoA-I was isolated from normolipidemic mouse blood (38Kostner G.M. Alaupovic P. Biochemistry. 1972; 11: 3419-3428Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar) and labeled with 125I (460 cpm/ng of protein) (39Sinn H.J. Schrenk H.H. Friedrich E.A. Via D.P. Dresel H.A. Anal. Biochem. 1988; 170: 186-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). 100 μg were injected into the tail vein, and the disappearance of radioactivity in plasma was monitored over 6 h. Blood samples were collected by retroorbital puncture. Ketone bodies and glucose were determined using commercial kits (Sigma). FFA levels were also measured enzymatically (WAKO Chemicals, Neuss, Germany) immediately after the blood was collected. If not otherwise stated, results are given as means ± S.D. Statistical significance was tested by using the two-tailed Student's t test. After killing the mice with Isofluran (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech and Upjohn), various tissues were excised and prepared for analysis. Liver, heart muscle, skeletal muscle, kidney, brain, and spleen were formalin-fixed, embedded in paraffin wax by conventional techniques, hematoxylin-eosin-stained, and examined as previously described (40Levak-Frank S. Radner H. Walsh A. Stollberger R. Knipping G. Hoefler G. Sattler W. Weinstock P.H. Breslow J.L. Zechner R. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 976-986Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). In an attempt to rescue L0 mice from neonatal death, complete litters of newborn mice from 134 L1 × L1 matings were intraperitoneally injected with LPL-expressing adenovirus (Ad-LPL) immediately after birth (2–8 h). The optimal dose of Ad-LPL was determined by injecting four different virus concentrations: 5 × 108, 1 × 109, 5 × 109, and 8 × 109 pfu, respectively. The best results were obtained with an Ad-LPL concentration of 5×109 pfu, which was then used in all subsequent experiments. As depicted in Fig.1, Ad-LPL injection markedly increased the survival rate of L0 mice. Whereas all untreated L0 mice died within 24 h after birth, 97% of treated L0 animals were alive after this time point. During suckling, the mortality of treated animals increased. After 1 week, 35% of the L0 animals were still alive, whereas after 2 weeks only 10% survived. Most importantly, 3% of L0 mice persevered through the suckling period and weaning and lived normally into adulthood. The oldest L0 animals to date are 20 months of age. No correlation was observed between the number of littermates and the survival rate of L0 mice. Fig.2 exhibits the time course of LPL expression after Ad-LPL treatment in adult L2 mice. LPL activity measurements in PHP of adult control mice intravenously injected with 5×109 pfu of Ad-LPL revealed that a maximum expression level was observed 7 days following virus injection. Afterward, LPL activities decreased sharply and were back to preinjection levels 3 weeks after virus application. Although it was technically not possible to determine LPL activities in PHP of newborn pups, a similar expression pattern can be assumed in Ad-LPL-treated mice during the suckling period. PCR experiments in 3–4-week-old pups demonstrated that 3 weeks after injection, no adenoviral DNA was detectable in liver and other tissues of Ad-LPL-treated mice. Expectedly, LPL activity in PHP of adult L0 animals (12–14 weeks of age) was undetectable, whereas control animals exhibited normal LPL activity. In contrast, HL activity was increased in L0 mice by 1.7-fold when compared with L2 animals (TableI). In preheparin plasma the activities of HL were identical to those found in PHP, whereas LPL activity was not detectable (not shown).Table ILipolytic activities in postheparin plasma of fed Ad-LPL-treated L0 and L2 miceGenotypenLPLHLμmol FFA/ml/hL060.12 ± 0.17***2.45 ± 0.38**L276.6 ± 1.11.43 ± 0.48Mice were injected intraperitoneally with sodium heparin (1 unit/g body weight), and PHP was taken 20 min after injection.

To assess the consequences of LPL deficiency on body weight, all mice from L1 × L1 matings were weighed during suckling at days 3, 5, 7, 12, 14, and 21 and after weaning every 10 days (Fig.3A compares L2 and L0 mice). L0, L1, and L2 mice appeared normal immediately after birth. Upon suckling, Ad-LPL-injected L0 mice became slightly pale and exhibited reduced body weight compared with L1 and L2 mice. The weight differences were most evident just before and after weaning when a 35% weight reduction was observed in L0 mice (Fig. 3B). After weaning, L0 mice caught up in weight on a low fat diet, and by 3–4 months of age their body weight was identical to control mice. Gross pathological examination revealed no obvious abnormalities in adult L0 mice. Plasma TG and TC concentrations were determined in L0 and L2 mice at the age of 7 days, 14 days, and 12 weeks (Table II). During the suckling period, plasma TG levels in L0 mice increased gradually and were 2.9- and 68-fold increased in 7- and 14-day-old animals, respectively, compared with L2 mice. After weaning, the hypertriglyceridemia became less severe; however, in 12-week-old animals TG levels of L0 mice were still 44-fold (fed state) and 30-fold (fasted state) higher than in controls. A similar time course was observed for the plasma TC concentrations, although the differences among the mouse genotypes were less pronounced. A moderate 1.9-fold increase in 7-day-old animals was followed by a 14.3-fold increase in 14-day-old mice. At the age of 12 weeks, TC levels of L0 animals were 4.1-fold higher in the fed state and 2.5-fold higher in the fasted state than in L2 mice.Table IITriglyceride and total cholesterol levels in the plasma of Ad-LPL-treated L0 and L2 miceAgeGenotypenTGTCmg/dl1 weekFedL03599 ± 132**121 ± 12L214208 ± 7963 ± 172 weeksFedL039453 ± 821**828 ± 135*L27139 ± 4258 ± 812 weeksFedL074997 ± 1102***396 ± 90**L25113 ± 1997 ± 15FastedL072007 ± 375***172 ± 33***L2566 ± 769 ± 9Blood was taken in the morning from 1-week-old, 2-week-old, and 12-week-old male animals of each group having free access to food (fed samples) or after 10 h of nighttime fasting (fasted samples).

To investigate the lipid distribution among lipoprotein subclasses, fasted plasma samples of adult L0 and L2 mice were subjected to FPLC analysis (Fig. 4). TC measurements in FPLC subfractions revealed a 137-fold increase of the chylomicron-VLDL fraction in L0 mice. In contrast, HDL-C was undetectable in L0 mice, whereas in L2 mice the majority of the plasma cholesterol content was found in the HDL fraction. To independently validate the virtual absence of HDL in L0 mice, HDL-C plasma concentrations were also measured in plasma after precipitation of β-lipoproteins. In contrast to normal HDL-C levels found in L2 animals (84.05 ± 5.3 mg/dl), L0 mice essentially lacked HDL-C (0.9 ± 0.3 mg/dl). Two-dimensional polyacrylamide gradient gel electrophoresis of plasma samples from L0 and L2 mice and subsequent immunoblotting using a specific anti-apoA-I antibody identified two apoA-I-containing HDL subclasses in the plasma of L2 animals, one quantitatively major spot with electrophoretic α-mobility (α-LpA-I) and one quantitatively minor with electrophoretic pre-β-mobility (pre-β1-LpA-I) (Fig.5). In contrast, plasma samples of L0 mice contained only traces of apoA-I in the HDL region of the gel, indicating not only the virtual absence of α-migrating mature HDL but also a drastic reduction of their precursor preβ1-LpA-I. Northern blotting experiments were performed to analyze apoA-I mRNA levels in the liver of L0 and L2 mice. ApoA-I mRNA concentrations were identical in rescued L0 mice compared with L2 mice (Fig.6). Accordingly, the absence of HDL particles in the plasma of L0 mice is not a result of decreased apoA-I gene ex"

We show that perplexing patterns in seismicity and fault plane solutions can be accounted for by the juxtaposition of a steep-dipping Wadati-Benioff zone and a subhorizontal remnant of slab that is no longer attached to the actively subducting lithosphere. The detached slab may be from a previous episode of subduction along the fossil Vitiaz trench about 5 to 8 million years ago. The juxtaposition of slabs retains a large amount of subducted material in the transition zone of the mantle. Such a configuration, if common in the past, would allow the preservation of a primordial component in the lower mantle."

Nature. 1999; 399: A23-A31Crossref PubMed Scopus (1515) Google Scholar, and references therein). Senile plaques are composed of amyloid β peptides (Aβ) comprising ∼40 amino acids that are proteolytically produced from β-amyloid precursor protein (βAPP). βAPP is initially cleaved by β-secretase to generate a 99-residue C-terminal fragment (C99) that then is cleaved by γ-secretase to generate Aβ. A subset of AD is inherited as an autosomal dominant trait (familial AD: FAD). Genetic mutations in βAPP genes that cosegregate with the clinical manifestations of FAD increase production of the amyloidogenic Aβ42 species ending at Ala42 (2Suzuki N. Cheung T.T. Cai X.D.

Science. 1994; 264: 1336-1340Crossref PubMed Scopus (1334) Google Scholar); Aβ42, which normally comprises only ∼10% of total secreted Aβ, aggregates much faster than the predominant Aβ40 species (3Jarrett J.T. Lansbury Jr., P.T. Cell. 1993; 73: 1055-1058Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1886) Google Scholar), and Aβ42 is the initially and predominantly deposited Aβ species in AD brains (4Iwatsubo T.

Mutations in presenilin (PS) 1 and PS2 genes are linked to the majority of early onset FAD. FAD-linked PS mutations affect γ-cleavage of βAPP leading to an increased production of Aβ42 (1Selkoe D.J. Nature. 1999; 399: A23-A31Crossref PubMed Scopus (1515) Google Scholar). In contrast, ablation of PS1 and PS2 genes in mice completely inhibited production of both Aβ40 and Aβ42, accompanied by accumulation of the βAPP C-terminal stubs (i.e. C99 and C83) that are the direct substrates for γ-secretase (6De Strooper B.

Furthermore, studies inCaenorhabditis elegans and Drosophila melanogaster, as well as in knockout mice, suggested that PS facilitates Notch signaling by activating the ligand-induced intramembranous proteolysis of Notch receptors at site-3 to release their cytoplasmic domains (NICD) (7Herreman A.

This cleavage appears to be very similar to γ-cleavage of βAPP because it occurs close to or within the membrane, inhibited by inactivation of PS genes, and can be blocked by peptidomimetic γ-secretase inhibitors (reviewed in Ref.12Kopan R.

We and others have shown that the ectopically expressed NTFs of PS1 or PS2 are not stabilized and do not overproduce Aβ42 on FAD mutant basis (31Citron M. Eckman C.B. Diehl T.S. Corcoran C.

Furthermore, we have found that the integrity of the C terminus of PS is required for its stabilization and abnormal γ-cleavage of βAPP (i.e. Aβ42 overproduction) (34Tomita T. Takikawa R. Koyama A.

PS are evolutionarily conserved proteins that are present in almost all multicellular organisms including vertebrates and invertebrates as well as plants, and the C-terminal region of PS is highly conserved. Notably, we found that all known PS proteins contain an amino acid motif comprised of four consecutive amino acids, proline-alanine-leucine-proline, at the C terminus, including C. elegans SPE-4 that harbors a shorter C-terminal region, which we designated PALP motif (Fig. 1A). In C. elegansand Drosophila, many of the loss-of-function mutants of PS defective in Notch signaling have been reported, and the first proline of PALP motif is replaced with leucine in recessive loss-of-function mutants of C. elegans spe-4 (35Arduengo P.M. Appleberry O.K. Chuang P. L'Hernault S.W. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 3645-3654Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and Drosophila Psn (36Guo Y. Livne-Bar I. Zhou L. Boulianne G.L. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 8435-8442Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In C. elegans spe-4 (eb-12) allele, which results in P440L (corresponding to the first proline of PALP) amino acid substitution of SPE-4 protein, morphogenesis of fibrous body-membranous organelle complexes is defective and spermatogenesis arrests at an unusual cellular stage in a similar manner to a null phenotype, despite robust synthesis of mutant proteins (35Arduengo P.M.

These results suggested that the first proline of PALP motif plays an important role in the γ-secretase functions of PS. In contrast, it has been documented that the second proline of PALP motif is replaced with serine (37Palmer M.S. Beck J.A. Campbell T.A. Humphries C.B. Roques P.K. Fox N.C. Harvey R. Rossor M.N.

Scanned images were quantitated with Image Gauge (Fuji) or Scion Image (Scion Corp.) software. To evaluate the half-lives of transfected PS proteins and fragments thereof by blocking total cellular protein synthesis, cultured cells were treated with cycloheximide (30 µg/ml) for 12 or 24 h and then analyzed by immunoblotting with appropriate PS antibodies. N2a cells stably coexpressing PS2 and NotchΔE were starved for 2 h in methionine- and serum-free DMEM (Life Technologies, Inc.) containing 10 mm butyric acid. Cells were subsequently metabolically labeled for 15 min with 6 MBq/ml [35S]methionine (Expre35S35S, PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and chased for 60 min in complete DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum with or without addition of 10 µm clasto-lactacystin β-lactone (Sigma) in culture media.

Molecular mass marker proteins (thyroglobulin, 669 kDa; ferritin, 440 kDa; catalase, 232 kDa; lactate dehydrogenase, 140 kDa; bovine serum albumin, 67 kDa; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) were fractionated in parallel to allow estimation of the molecular mass of the fractions. Sedimentation was carried out for 16 h at 38,000 rpm in a Beckman SW41 rotor, and the gradients were fractionated from the bottom to give 18–20 fractions of 600 µl. 20 µl of each fraction was separated by SDS-PAGE for immunoblot analysis.

The tested hypothesis is that template switching by reverse transcriptase is promoted at sites where homologous regions of two RNAs are brought in close proximity via stable intertemplate interactions. Frequency and distribution of template switching between homologous donor and acceptor RNAs were examined within the human immunodeficiency virus type I (HIV-I) 5′-untranslated region (UTR) containing the dimer initiation sequence (DIS). Results were compared with control nondimerizing templates from the pol region. The dimerizing UTR templates displayed a 4-fold higher transfer efficiency than the control. A striking 53% of transfers in the UTR mapped near the DIS, of which two-thirds occurred immediately 5′ to this sequence. In the UTR template, deletion of the DIS hairpin disrupted template dimerization and caused a 4-fold drop in transfer efficiency. Insertion of the DIS within the pol template increased both dimerization and transfer efficiency. Transfer distributions revealed that in both sets of templates, DIS-induced dimerization increased the efficiency of transfers across the whole template, with the transfers peaking around the dimerization site. Overall, these results suggest that template dimerization facilitated by the unique geometry of the DIS-promoted kissing interactions effectively promotes recombination within the HIV-I 5′-UTR.

After entry into the host cell, the viral reverse transcriptase (RT)1 copies it into double-stranded DNA by a process utilizing both DNA polymerase and RNase H activities. Completion of synthesis of both minus and plus strand DNA involves template switching events in which the strong stop DNA is transferred from the original template to a complementary sequence at the 3′ end of either the same or a second homologous copy of the template (1Gilboa G.M. Mitra S.W. Goff S. Baltimore D. Cell. 1979; 18: 93-100Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar). In addition to these obligatory transfers, strand transfers involving internal regions of the RNA or complementary DNA have also been demonstrated to occur during replication (2Clavel F. Hoggan M.D. Willey R.L. Strebel K. Martin M.A. Repaske R. J. Virol. 1989; 63: 1455-1459Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3Goodrich D.W. Duesberg P.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

These include both intrastrand (resulting in deletions or duplications) and interstrand transfers (resulting in recombination).The presence of two RNA copies provides a functional advantage during reverse transcription, allowing RT to switch templates should it encounter a break or damage within the RNA strand being copied. The forced copy-choice model of recombination (5Coffin J.M. J. Gen. Virol. 1979; 42: 1-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar) predicts that the process occurs during minus strand DNA synthesis. However, because template switching also occurs in the absence of breaks in the RNA and may not always be forced, the process fits the more generalized copy-choice model (6Xu H. Boeke J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 8553-8557Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Such interstrand template switching involving two co-packaged nonidentical RNAs would then result in a recombinant provirus.

The DIS hairpin is dispensable for virus replication, although deletion of the element is associated with reduced encapsidation, minus strand synthesis, and infectivity, as well as altered replication kinetics (50Berkhout B. van Wamel J.L.

Virol. 1996; 70: 8348-8354Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition to the DIS hairpin, the HIV-I 5′ leader sequence encodes multiple cis-acting elements, including the packaging signal (ψ) and splice donor site, that regulate distinct steps in the virus life cycle (52Berkhout B. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 1996; 54: 1-34Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). Whereas the dimeric state of the genome allows for recombination events during reverse transcription, the specific role of template-template interaction sites and genome dimerization in reverse transcription and recombination begs a more detailed analysis.Studies presented by the Pedersen group have shown recombination-mediated rescue of PBS-defective murine leukemia virus through template switching within the dimer linkage structure (20Mikkelsen J.G.

These results prompted us to examine strand transfers within the highly structured HIV-I 5′ leader sequence and the effect of DIS in promoting the process. We hypothesized that direct template-template interactions serve as an important determinant in promoting transfers by bringing homologous regions of the RNA into close proximity. Using RNA templates comprising the dimerizing HIV-I leader sequence and a control nondimerizing pol sequence, we have addressed the role of kissing interactions in facilitating transfers by examining template dimerization, transfer efficiencies, and crossover distribution. The UTR templates supported a high efficiency of crossovers, with a clustering of transfers around the dimerization site. Inhibition of donor-acceptor interactions through deletion of the DIS sequence resulted not only in a suppression of the hot spot but, more significantly, in an overall reduction in transfers across the whole template. Parallel experiments with the pol templates, in which the presence of the DIS sequence induced template dimerization and enhanced transfer efficiency, further verified these observations. Results give insights into the role of template dimerization as a determinant in promoting template switching during minus strand synthesis by HIV-I RT.RESULTSBecause dimerization interactions within the 5′ leader sequence bring homologous regions of the two RNAs into close proximity, we hypothesized that this would create a favorable site for template switching by RT during minus strand synthesis. We therefore examined reverse transcription through the HIV-I 5′ leader sequence using donor and acceptor RNAs comprising the genomic sequence from the PBS to the start of the gag coding region.Template Switching Is Supported by the 5′ Leader SequenceThe HIV-I 5′-UTR sequence chosen here to examine strand transfers spans the region from the PBS to the start of the gag coding region. This structure simulates the natural replication intermediate during completion of minus strand DNA synthesis. The donor and acceptor templates share a 177-nt-long region of homology (Fig.1). Synthesis was initiated on the donor RNA using the 5′ end-labeled MB20 DNA primer that annealed to the 3′ end of the donor, but not to the acceptor. Transfers result when the extending primer terminus, following release from the donor template, anneals to the homologous acceptor template and completes synthesis.To test for recombination events, primer extension on the donor was compared in the absence (Fig.2A) and presence (Fig.2B) of acceptor template. Full-length donor-directed synthesis yielded a 214-nt product, which was detected as early as 1 min (Fig. 2A). In the presence of acceptor RNA, an additional band corresponding to the expected 250-nt transfer product was also visible (Fig. 2B). At 60 min, 18–20% of full-length products were the result of synthesis completed on the acceptor after transfer, indicating efficient strand transfer synthesis on the UTR templates. In contrast to the rapid generation of donor extension products, a substantial delay was evident in the appearance of transfer products, which were detectable only by 5 min (Fig.2B, lane 1). The stable secondary structures and sequence characteristics of this template (57Harrison G.P. Mayo M.S. Hunter E. Lever A.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 3433-3442Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 58Berkhout B. van Wamel J.L. RNA (N. Y.). 2000; 6: 282-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) most likely induce the observed pause sites during synthesis.Figure 2Minus strand synthesis catalyzed by HIV-I RTon the 5′-UTR leader sequence. Synthesis was initiated on the donor template using a 5′ end-labeled MB20 DNA primer in the absence (A) and presence (B) of acceptor RNA. Reactions were terminated at various time points as indicated, and products were resolved on a 6% polyacrylamide gel under denaturing conditions. Full-length synthesis on the donor resulted in a 214-nt donor extension product (A and B), whereas products resulting from template switching and synthesis on the acceptor generated a 250-nt transfer product (B). Pause sites corresponding to the SD and DIS elements are indicated. Lane M, 10-base DNA ladder.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)We note here that the 250-nt product would consist of transfer products generated from single and odd numbers of crossovers, where synthesis was completed on the acceptor. Sequence analysis of transfer products revealed that the majority of products resulted from single crossovers. An average of 1 in 20 recombinants was the product of triple crossovers. Recombinants resulting from double and even numbers of transfers would complete synthesis on the donor template and would therefore be indistinguishable from donor extension products. Sequence analysis of donor extension products, however, did not detect even number transfer products. Apparently, such products, if generated, are undetectable among the large excess of products of uninterrupted synthesis on the donor template.Template Switching Occurs Predominantly within the DIS Hairpin RegionBecause frequent template switching was evident within the leader sequence, we could then correlate the distribution of transfer sites with structural features of the sequence. Cell culture studies in a murine leukemia virus-based system have shown recombination-mediated rescue of PBS-defective virions in which crossovers map to hairpins within the dimerization domain. If transfers at this site were promoted by a specific mechanism involving RNA sequence or structure within this region, we could anticipate a preferred site of template switching or a recombination hot spot within the HIV-I leader sequence. To determine this, the transfer products were cloned and analyzed by sequencing. Donor and acceptor RNAs were generated from HIV-I strains NL4-3 and JRCSF, respectively, allowing the use of natural sequence variations within the homologous region as markers in mapping crossovers. This approach circumvents the need to introduce base substitution markers that might disrupt natural structural features in the RNA that contribute to the pattern of recombination.The transfer distribution, as analyzed from a total of 90 clones from two independent experiments, is presented in Fig.3A. As discussed previously, the majority of transfer products (∼95%) resulted from single template switching events. Only single crossover products were used in the analysis, although the inclusion of multiple crossover products did not change transfer distribution. The six sequence markers distributed across the region of homology were used in determining crossover sites within the transfer products. Transfers occurred across the length of the template between all of the markers, suggesting that almost any region within the template had the potential to support homologous recombination. A highly preferred region of template switching, however, was clearly evident between markers 3 and 4. A striking 53% of transfers occurred within this 48-nt region. In contrast, adjoining sequences within the template supported a significantly lower but almost uniform frequency of transfers. The three template segments, namely, the 58-nt sequence downstream to marker 1, the 40-nt sequence between markers 1 and 3, and the 30-nt sequence past marker 4, each supported an average transfer frequency of 15–17%. This corresponds to a third of the transfer frequency observed in the segment between markers 3 and 4. To account for the uneven distances between the markers, transfer frequencies within marker segments were corrected by adjusting for the distance between the markers (Fig.3B). Transfer frequency within a given marker segment was divided by the length of that segment, giving a normalized value that relates to transfer frequency in percentage/10 nt. It is evident from the raw and adjusted distributions (Fig. 3, A andB) that the higher transfer frequency is not a simple consequence of increased marker length. The segment between markers 3 and 4 had three times the potential to promote transfers relative to its neighboring regions.Figure 3Distribution of transfers within the 5′-UTR. Template description is same as that in Fig. 1. The region corresponding to the 35-nt DIS hairpin is indicated. Numbers1–6 represent marker positions in the templates. A, hatched bars between markers represent the average transfer frequencies within the marker segment and correspond to the total transfers detected within a given marker segment calculated as a percentage of the total transfers analyzed on the template. Corresponding numerical values are indicated above the bars. Values were averaged from two independent experiments of about 45 sequences each and consisted of products resulting from single crossover events. Transfer efficiency of 18–20% on the template was determined as the percentage of transfer products over the transfer and donor extension products combined. B, hatched bars between markers represent transfer frequencies normalized for the distance between two markers. Numerical values are indicated abovethe bars and were calculated by dividing the crossover frequencies measured in A by the length of the respective marker segment. Marker segments are highlighted by parenthesis,with the segment length in nucleotides indicated initalic.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Interestingly, the preferred region for transfers, defined by markers 3 and 4, includes a major part of the DIS hairpin, the structural element involved in genome dimerization. The template also harbors several other well-characterized structural elements, including the SD hairpin between markers 2 and 3 and the Ψ and AUG hairpins downstream of marker 1 (Fig. 1). The presence of these structural elements in the donor and acceptor RNAs was confirmed using an RNA folding algorithm (59Jaeger J.A. Turner D.H. Zuker M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 7706-7710Crossref PubMed Scopus (779) Google Scholar). Whereas these regions contributed to transfers, they did not create a significant peak of transfers, unlike the DIS. Also, the loop-loop kissing interaction characteristic of the DIS hairpin is not promoted by any of the other hairpin elements within the leader sequence. The biased transfer distribution within the UTR suggests a hierarchy within secondary structures in facilitating transfers. Structural features of the DIS hairpin, including those related to dimerization, appear to be more effective than hairpins in adjacent sequences at promoting recombination.To test for PCR-mediated recombination, separate extension reactions were performed using NL4-3 and JRCSF acceptor RNAs. Samples from the two extension reactions were mixed, amplified by PCR, and cloned. Sequence analysis revealed that ∼1 in 24 amplification products was recombinant (∼4%), and these did not distribute with a noticeable trend. Recall that all experimental amplification products derived from the transfer product band were recombinants. This control experiment indicates that artifacts from PCR amplification were not significant enough to skew analysis of the transfer products.DIS Mutant AcceptorThe 98-nt sequence downstream of marker 3, comprising the first half of the template and carrying the AUG, ψ, and SD hairpins, contributed to only 33% of the total internal transfers on the template (Fig. 3). In comparison, the 88-nt region between markers 1 and 4 carrying the DIS and SD stem loops contributed to about 70% of the total internal transfers on the template, three-fourths of which occurred within a short 48-nt sequence harboring the kissing hairpin. The template segment harboring the DIS sequence thus appears to have a pronounced effect in promoting transfers. We hoped that a finer analysis of transfer distributions at this preferred region would provide insights into the mechanism of the transfer process. To address this, the JRCSF DIS mutant acceptor carrying an additional set of markers 3a and 3b at the base of the DIS stem loop was generated (Fig. 4A). To minimize possible structural distortions, this was done by substituting the U-A base pair at the base of the stem with A-U, so that the stability of the DIS hairpin was minimally compromised. Use of the RNA folding algorithm (59Jaeger J.A. Turner D.H. Zuker M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 7706-7710Crossref PubMed Scopus (779) Google Scholar) revealed similar folding potentials for both wild type (WT) and DIS mutant acceptor templates. Transfer assays were performed using the NL4-3 donor and JRCSF DIS mutant acceptor, and transfer efficiency and distribution were analyzed as described previously.Figure 4Schematic of the mutant DIS hairpin and its effect on transfer distribution.

The lesions are the result of direct arteriovenous connections that can lead to large arteriovenous malformations in brain, lung, and liver. Many of the mutations reported to date in endoglin include deletions, insertion, and point mutations in the coding region, leading to premature stop codons and frameshifts that result in predicted truncated proteins that are neither expressed at the cell surface nor secreted. This and the existence of null allele mutations support haploinsufficiency as the underlying mechanism for HHT1 (12Pece N. Vera S. Cymerman U. White R.J. Wrana J.L. Letarte M. J. Clin.

Thus, the study of the regulation of endoglin gene expression appears to be critical to correct the disease. As a first step to ascertain the factors involved in the regulation of endoglin expression, we initiated the functional characterization of its promoter region (15Rı́us C. Smith J.D. Almendro N. Langa C. Botella L.M. Marchuk D.A. Vary C.P.H. Bernabéu C. Blood. 1998; 92: 4677-4690Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The primary analysis of endoglin promoter reveals that it is a TATA- and CAAT-less promoter, but with GC-rich tracts, including an Sp1 consensus site at −37, in the vicinity of the transcription initiation nucleus. These features are typical of TATA-less promoters with multiple transcription start sites (16Pugh B.F. Tjian R. Cell. 1990; 61: 1187-1197Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (736) Google Scholar) and are also present in other components of the mammalian TGF-β system, including human TGF-β1 (17Kim S.J. Glick A.

Letamendı́a A. Zhang H. Rı́us C. Almendro N. Raab U. López L.A. Langa C. Fabra A. Letarte M. Bernabéu C. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 1109-1121Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar), and that TGF-β1 is also able to induce the transcriptional activity of the endoglin promoter (15Rı́us C. Smith J.D. Almendro N. Langa C. Botella L.M. Marchuk D.A. Vary C.P.H. Bernabéu C. Blood. 1998; 92: 4677-4690Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The stimulation by TGF-β could be detected in different endoglin promoter constructs, representing successive deletions from −400 to −141 base pairs, but the putative TGF-β responsive elements within this fragment have not been identified yet. The transcription modulatory effect of TGF-β is exerted by binding to type I and type II serine-threonine kinase receptors, which propagate intracellular signaling by phosphorylation of members of the Smad family of proteins (21ten Dijke P. Miyazono K. Heldin C.H. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 64-70Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar, 22Massagué J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 753-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (3999) Google Scholar). Smads may be classified into three different subclasses: receptor-regulated or R-Smads, as Smad2, and Smad3 (activated by TGF-β), or Smad1, Smad5, and Smad8 (activated by BMP); the common partner or Co-Smad, Smad4; and finally the inhibitory Smads, I-Smads, Smad6, and Smad7. R-Smads are activated by phosphorylation at their C-terminal SS(M/V)S-motifs, whereafter they heteroligomerize with the common partner, Smad4. The Smad complexes are then translocated to the nucleus, where the transcriptional activities of different genes are affected. Within the nucleus, Smads bind to their target genes at the motifs called Smad binding elements (SBE) (23Dennler S. Itoh S. Vivien D. ten Dijke P. Huet S. Gauthier J.M.

Cell. 1998; 1: 611-617Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (892) Google Scholar). However, Smads bind with low affinity to their target sequences, requiring interaction with additional transcription factors in order to exert its function (27Attisano L. Wrana J.L. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 235-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar, 28Iavarone A. Massagué J. Nature. 1997; 387: 417-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). Several transcription factors and transcriptional co-activators have been identified to cooperate with Smad in transcriptional activation such as CBP/p300, FAST, TFE-3, PEBP-2/CBF, ATF-2, OAZ, and AP-1 (21ten Dijke P. Miyazono K. Heldin C.H. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 64-70Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar, 27Attisano L. Wrana J.L. Curr. Opin.

The mechanisms whereby different transcription factors participate cooperatively in TGF-β induced transcription involve the stabilization of protein-DNA complexes, bridging Smads with the basal transcription machinery, or stimulating the acetyltransferase activity in promoter regions (21ten Dijke P. Miyazono K. Heldin C.H. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 64-70Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar,27Attisano L. Wrana J.L. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 235-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar). In the proximal endoglin promoter, there are G/C-rich motifs, which are putative binding sites for the Sp1 transcription factor. Sp1 is an ubiquitously expressed protein with a zinc finger DNA-binding domain (16Pugh B.F. Tjian R. Cell. 1990; 61: 1187-1197Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (736) Google Scholar, 30Berg J.M.

Sp1 is required for early embryogenesis and regulates terminal differentiation of cells by affecting the methylation of DNA CpG islands (32Marin M. Karis A. Visser P. Grosveld F. Philipsen S. Cell. 1997; 89: 619-628Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar). Sp1 interacts directly with basal transcription machinery factors and cooperates with several transcriptional activators (33Saluja D. Vassallo M.F. Tanese N. Mol. Cell.

We show that Sp1 is a critical factor for the basal transcription and for the TGF-β-induced transcriptional stimulation, mediated by Smad proteins, of the proximal promoter of endoglin. All the cell lines were cultured in a 5% CO2 atmosphere at 37 °C (unless otherwise indicated) in medium containing 10% fetal calf serum and 2 mml-glutamine and antibiotics (penicillin-streptomycin, 100 IU/ml; gentamicin, 100 IU/ml; Life Technologies, Inc.). Human hepatoma HepG2 cells, human epithelioid carcinoma HeLa, and monkey kidney COS cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with penicillin-streptomycin. The human monocytic line U-937 was cultured in RPMI medium supplemented with penicillin-streptomycin. The Drosophila Schneider S-2 cells were grown at room temperature in 100-ml culture bottles containing S-2 medium (Sigma) supplemented with 100 IU/ml gentamicin. The reporter vectors pCD105(−250/+350), pCD105(−150/+350), and pCD105(−50/+350) were derived from the human endoglin promoter (15Rı́us C. Smith J.D. Almendro N. Langa C. Botella L.M. Marchuk D.A. Vary C.P.H. Bernabéu C. Blood. 1998; 92: 4677-4690Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Polymerase chain reaction was carried out in the presence of sequence-specific primers surrounded byHindIII/XhoI sites for directional cloning and the resulting −250/+350, −150/+350, and −50/+350 fragments were inserted into the reporter luciferase vector pXP2 previously digested with HindIII/XhoI. Mutagenesis of Sp1 site at −37 was performed by recombinant polymerase chain reaction, using mutated primers −50/−24 D (GCA GGC GGC CTG GG ttt AGC CCC TTCTC) and −50/−24 R (GAGGG GGG GCT aaa CCC AGG CCG CCT GC), where the mutated nucleotides appear in lowercase (CCC in the original sequence was changed by TTT). Using the pCD105(−50/+350) construct as template, mutant oligonucleotides −50/−24 D and −50/−24 R, together with flanking primers of the pXP2 vector, allowed the amplification of the mutant −50/+350 fragment, that was inserted into theHindIII/XhoI site of the pXP2 vector leading to the pCD105(−50/+350)Sp1Mut construct. The altered construct was confirmed by automated sequencing (ABI Prism 310 genetic analyzer). The reporter plasmid pRL-LUC, containing the prolactin promoter with a minimal TATA box, was kindly provided by Dr. Mercedes Rincón (Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, CT). Transfections were performed with 1 μg of reporter vector, the indicated amounts of expression vectors, and Superfect reagent (Qiagen), following the instructions of manufacturer for each type of cell line. Luciferase activity was determined with the Luciferase assay reagent (Promega, Madison, WI) using a TD-20/20 luminometer (Promega). Luciferase activity values were corrected by internal normalization using cotransfection of the test plasmids with β-galactosidase, yielding the relative luciferase units as a measurement of the promoter activity. Luciferase assays were carried out in duplicate, and each experiment of transfection was repeated at least three times with similar results. Data plotted in the figures represent the mean ± standard deviations of intra assay values from representative experiments. When required, after transfection, cells were treated for 20 h with 10 ng/ml TGF-β1 (R&D Systems). The increase of the promoter activity by different stimuli was measured by -fold induction values using as a reference the activity of untreated samples whose arbitrary value is 1. For inhibition by bisanthracycline (WP631) of Sp1 binding to DNA, cells were incubated with different concentrations (0.1–1 μm) of WP631 (Tropix) 3 h after transfection and kept for 20 h. The expression vectors pCMV5-Flag-Smad3, and pCMV5-Smad4-HA, encoding human Smad members Flag- or hemagglutinin (HA) epitope-tagged, and pCMV5-TβRI encoding a constitutively activated form of the TGF-β receptor type I (ALK-5) have been described previously (39Labbé E. Silvestri C. Hoodless P.A. Wrana J.L. Attisano L. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 109-120Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar). EMSAs were carried out as described (15Rı́us C. Smith J.D. Almendro N. Langa C. Botella L.M. Marchuk D.A. Vary C.P.H. Bernabéu C. Blood. 1998; 92: 4677-4690Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 40Schreiber E. Matthias P. Muller M.M. Schaffner W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 6419Crossref PubMed Scopus (3918) Google Scholar). To obtain nuclear extracts, subconfluent cell cultures, either untreated or treated with TGF-β1 (10 ng/ml), were washed, collected in cold phosphate-buffered saline, and resuspended in appropriate buffers to collect the nuclear fraction and nuclear extracts. Complementary oligonucleotides, constituting the different binding motifs, were annealed followed by 5′ end labeling using [γ-32P]ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase. Approximately 5 ng (100,000 cpm) of the respective probe was incubated with 5–10 μg of nuclear extract and 2 μg/reaction of poly(dI-dC) for 30 min on ice. Oligonucleotides used as probes were −50/−24 WT (GCAGGCG GCCTGGG CCCAGCC CCTTCTC), and −50/−24 Sp1-Mut (GCAGGCG GCCTGGG TTTAGCC CCTTCTC). For competition experiments, an excess of 100- or 200-fold excess of unlabeled double-stranded oligonucleotide was added. When required, EMSAs were carried out in the presence of recombinant Smad or Sp1 proteins. In experiments with antibody, protein extract and 1 μg of commercial antibody were preincubated for 60 min on ice prior to the addition of the remaining components of the binding reaction. Rabbit polyclonal antibodies anti-Sp1, anti-AP-2, and anti-Smad3 were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). For specific inhibition of Sp1 binding to DNA, nuclear extracts were incubated with the indicated concentrations of WP631 (Tropix). Binding reactions were separated by nondenaturing 6% PAGE in Tris-Borate-EDTA buffer at 4 °C, dried, and visualized by autoradiography. EMSAs were repeated at least three times with similar results, and representative experiments are shown in the corresponding figures. The PINPOINT technique is an alternative, in vivo method to the in vitro footprinting and allows the identification and positioning of a given transcription factor on the promoter (41Lee J.S. Lee C.H. Chung J.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 969-974Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The sense +42/+24 (CAG CAG GGA GCT CCC GGC) and antisense −73/−56 (GTG GCA CTT CCT CTA CCC) endoglin primers, as well as the Sp1 pointer (construction p588, kindly provided by Dr. Chung), were used. COS cells were cotransfected with pCD105(−150/+350) as reporter, and the p588 Sp1 pointer vector, which contains the Sp1 domains derived from pPacSp1 fused to the nuclease domain of restriction enzyme FokI. Because the nuclease domain ofFokI lacks sequence specificity, the position and the probability of cleavage by the Sp1 pointer is determined by Sp1 binding to DNA. The cleavage site was detected by primer extension. Two primers were used: an antisense primer, complementary to +46/+24 positions of the endoglin promoter; and the sense primer −73/−56. Total DNA from transfected cells was collected and subjected to primer extension with the above-mentioned 5′-kinased oligonucleotides. Reactions were loaded in a 6% polyacrylamide: 7.5 m urea sequencing gels, in the presence of a G+A sequencing lane. Gels were dried and autoradiographed. PINPOINT experiments were repeated at least four times with similar results, and a representative experiment is shown in the corresponding figure. The glutathioneS-transferase (GST) fusion proteins, GST-Smad3, and GST-Smad4, kindly provided by Dr. Liliana Attisano (University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada), were expressed in Escherichia coli strain DH5α and purified as described (42Kardassis D. Papakosta P. Pardali K. Moustakas A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29572-29581Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). In vitro transcribed and translated Sp1 protein was obtained using a TnT kit (TnT® T7 coupled reticulocyte lysate system, Promega) in the presence of 1 μg of pCiNeoSp1 vector generously provided by Dr. Scott L. Friedman (Mount Sinai Medical Center, New York, NY), and one tenth of the reaction was used for each DNA binding experiment. Forty hours after transfection of COS-7 cells, total extracts were prepared by lysing the cells in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 mm aprotinin, and 2 mm Pefabloc at 4 °C. The cell extracts were centrifuged at 10,000 rpm at 4 °C and incubated with anti-Sp1 or anti-Smad3 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for 2 h at 4 °C. Afterward, immunocomplexes were precipitated with protein G-Sepharose, washed with lysis buffer twice, and dissolved in Laemmli-SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis loading buffer. After 8% SDS-PAGE, the resolved proteins were transferred to Hybond-C extra nitrocellulose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and the antigens were detected by incubation with the specific antibodies (anti-Sp1 or anti Smad3), followed by incubation with a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit or anti-mouse IgG (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and developing with the Super Signal reagent from Pierce for enhanced chemiluminescence on x-ray film. Experiments were repeated at least five times with similar results, and a representative experiment is shown in the corresponding figure. COS-7 cells were transfected with the expression vectors pCMV5-Flag-Smad3, pCMV5-Smad4-HA, and pCMV5-TβRI using Superfect (Qiagen). After 48 h, cells were resuspended in a solution containing 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 50 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20, and 10% glycerol supplemented with protease and phosphatase inhibitors, and lysed by sonication. The lysates were precleared in the presence of ImmunoPure streptavidin-agarose (Pierce), followed by incubation with 200 ng of biotinylated −50/−24 oligonucleotide and 2 μg of poly(dI-dC). Endogenous Sp1 bound to the endoglin probe was then captured by streptavidin-agarose, washed in the same lysis buffer, fractioned on SDS-PAGE (8%), transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes, and developed as indicated in the previous section. Experiments were repeated at least five times with similar results, and a representative experiment is shown in the corresponding figure. We have shown previously that TGF-β1 stimulates the activity of the endoglin promoter (15Rı́us C. Smith J.D. Almendro N. Langa C. Botella L.M. Marchuk D.A. Vary C.P.H. Bernabéu C. Blood. 1998; 92: 4677-4690Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Since TGF-β signaling is exerted through Smads, we assessed whether Smad proteins could reproduce the TGF-β-mediated stimulation of the endoglin promoter. Thus, HepG2 cells were transiently cotransfected with the reporter constructs pCD105(−350/+350), pCD105(−250/+350), and pCD105(−50/+350), derived from the proximal endoglin promoter (Fig. 1), together with an expression vector encoding Smad3. These constructs were transactivated by Smad3, and significant induction values were obtained with the −350/+350 (3-fold), −250/+350 (2.5-fold) and −50/+350 (2.5-fold) promoter fragments, whereas the promoterless pXP2 vector was unresponsive. The fact that the pCD105(−50/+350) construct, containing only 50 base pairs upstream of the transcription start site, displayed a level of stimulation by Smad3 similar to the longer constructs, suggested that a TGF-β/Smad-responsive element was located in this proximal region of the endoglin promoter. Interestingly, within this region, three putative Smad binding elements and one Sp1 motif were identified (Fig.1). To determine the sequences responsible for the TGF-β/Smad responsiveness of the endoglin promoter, DNase I footprinting experiments with TGF-β treated versusuntreated cells were performed. In different cell lines (U-937, L6E9, and HMEC-1), a protection area spanning the region −50/−20 was revealed (data not shown). Within this sequence, there is a Sp1 consensus site at −37/−29 (CCCAGCCCC) partially overlapping with a preceding G/C-rich region at −50/−35. To test whether the protection of the Sp1 motif was meaningful in vivo, the PINPOINT technique (41Lee J.S. Lee C.H. Chung J.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 969-974Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) was applied. COS cells were cotransfected with pCD105(−150/+350) as reporter, together with the expression Sp1 pointer, and the cleavage site was detected by primer extension. Specific extended bands were obtained with both sense and antisense primers (Fig. 2 A). Although the antisense primer gave a fragment of around 75 nucleotides, corresponding to a cut point by the nuclease around the sequence GCT from −33 to −35, the sense primer was extended in a series of discrete bands from −35 to −46. Taking into account the flexibility of the nuclease cutting point (around 4 base pairs from the Sp1 binding site in the DNA; Ref. 41Lee J.S. Lee C.H. Chung J.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 969-974Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), it can be concluded that Sp1 binds the endoglin promoter at around −33/−46. To confirm the Sp1 binding to the endoglin proximal promoter region, a synthetic oligonucleotide encompassing this region (−50/−24) was used as a probe in EMSA experiments. A slow migrating DNA-protein band, which was significantly increased after TGF-β treatment, was detected in both U937 and HepG2 cells (Fig. 2 B). This band was specific because it was competed with a 100-fold excess of cold oligonucleotide. Sp1 was present in the DNA complex, as the band decreased significantly (more than 5 times) using a Sp1-specific antibody, but was not affected by an anti-AP-2 antibody (Fig.2 B). The involvement of Sp1 was also demonstrated by the absence of a retarded complex when using a probe mutated at the Sp1 site (Fig. 2 C, lanes 3 and4). These results support the participation of Sp1 in the DNA-protein complex. Smad3 contains DNA binding activity with affinity toward the so-called SBE (GNCN), whereas Smad4 has affinity toward both the SBE and the G/C-rich motifs (39Labbé E. Silvestri C. Hoodless P.A.

Furthermore, 5′-nucleotidases specific for pyrimidine mononucleotides have been described in human erythrocytes (PN-I and PN-II) (4Valentine W.N. Fink K. Paglia D.E. Harris S.R. Adams W.S. J. Clin.

Recently, PN-I has been found to be identical to p36, an α-interferon-induced protein playing a role in immune diseases (6Amici A. Emanueli M. Raffaelli N. Ruggieri S. Saccucci F. Magni G. Blood. 2000; 96: 1596-1598Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). All these proteins expressing nucleotidase activity do not show significant sequence homologies to each other (7Sala-Newby G.B.

J. 1996; 317: 797-801Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). No phosphotransferase activity has been reported for the other nucleotidases described so far with the exception of PN-I and PN-II (11Amici A. Emanuelli M. Magni G. Raffaelli N. Ruggeri S. FEBS Lett. 1997; 419: 263-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). cN-II is a widely expressed enzyme with a remarkable sequence conservation through evolution. Its activity is involved in the regulation of the availability of intracellular IMP (12Itoh R. Echizen H. Higuchi M. Oka J. Yamada K. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. 1992; 103B: 153-159Google Scholar). Because IMP is the precursor of all purine nucleotides, which are not only nucleic acid building blocks but also energy transducers, intracellular and extra cellular signals, and metabolic regulators, the regulation of its hydrolysis is of paramount importance for a number of cell functions. Recently, an increased activity of cN-II has been associated to a developmental neurological disorder and to Lesch-Nyhan syndrome (13Page T., Yu, A. Fontanesi J. Nyhan W.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 1997; 94: 11601-11606Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar,14Pesi R. Micheli V. Jacomelli G. Peruzzi L. Camici M. Garcia-Gil M. Allegrini S. Tozzi M.G. Neuroreport. 2000; 11: 1827-1831Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar).In this work we provide evidence that cN-II becomes phosphorylated during the catalytic cycle on the first aspartate (Asp-52) occurring in a DMDYT motif conserved among the different species. This consensus sequence is also shared with other members of the 5′-nucleotidases family. In addition, a DXDX(T/V) motif has been described as being involved in the catalytic mechanism of a number of other phosphatases/phosphotransferases (15Collet J.F. Stroobant V. Pirard M. Delpierre G. Van Schaftingen E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14107-14112Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar), suggesting a common mechanism of action for all these enzymes that do not present any significant sequence homology with cN-II.DISCUSSIONThe results reported in this work demonstrate that cN-II is inhibited by WRK in a dose-dependent manner, suggesting that this reagent modifies carboxylate residues important for proper enzymatic functioning. WRK is well established in terms of its ability to modify aspartates or glutamates (27Keresztessy Z. Kiss L. Hughes M.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1994; 314: 142-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 28Kommisarov A.A. Romanova D.V. Debabov V.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10050-10055Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The selection of appropriate reaction conditions (pH 6.0 and very short inactivation times) ensured us an increased selectivity of WRK for acid residues and ruled out a possible reaction of this compound with other nucleophile amino acids (29Maralihalli G.B. Bhagwat A.S. J. Protein Chem. 1993; 12: 451-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar, 30Bustos P. Gajardo M.I. Gomez C. Goldie H. Cardemil E. Jabalquinto A.M. J.

The partial protection exerted by substrates and inhibitors of the enzyme is strongly indicative that some of the modified residues are located in the active site. It was previously observed that the allosteric inhibitor phosphate causes an increase in the Km for IMP, suggesting that the cN-II active site can result less accessibly in the presence of this anion. On the contrary, has been reported that the allosteric activator ATP, in the presence of Mg2+ causes a moderate decrease in theKm for the substrate and an increase in the catalytic rate (32Pesi R. Turriani M. Allegrini S. Scolozzi C. Camici M. Ipata P.L. Tozzi M.G. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1994; 312: 75-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). We find here that phosphate is effective in protection against WRK inactivation, while ATP-Mg2+, which increase the accessibility of the active site, do not exert any protective effect. On the contrary, ATP in the absence of Mg2+ indeed afforded a protection similar to that observed for IMP. ATP is also stabilizing the enzyme during storage and against thermal inactivation (12Itoh R. Echizen H. Higuchi M. Oka J. Yamada K. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. 1992; 103B: 153-159Google Scholar). These observations indicate that, in the absence of Mg2+, ATP can determine a protective effect possibly by an interaction with the active site.In a previous paper we demonstrated that cN-II forms a phosphoenzyme intermediate during catalysis, which was extremely labile (10Baiocchi C. Pesi R. Camici M. Itoh R. Tozzi M.G. Biochem. J. 1996; 317: 797-801Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). On the basis of this observation and the enzyme sensitivity toward treatment with WRK, we deduced that an aspartate or glutamate residue was the phosphate acceptor. The identification of this amino acid has been obtained after reduction of the acyl phosphate intermediate with radiolabeled borohydride, and separation of its tryptic digest, radioactivity, and molecular mass measurements. Sequence analysis performed on the isolated peptide demonstrated that Asp-52 was the phosphorylated residue. Site-directed mutagenesis experiments confirmed the fundamental role of this residue for the enzyme activity; in fact, even a conservative substitution in this position totally abolished enzyme activity and prevented the formation of the phosphorylated enzyme. In addition, mutants on Asp-54 were inactive and not able to generate this intermediate. On this basis, our results demonstrate that cN-II belongs to the large class of phosphohydrolases described by Collet et al. (15Collet J.F. Stroobant V. Pirard M. Delpierre G. Van Schaftingen E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14107-14112Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar) because it shows close to the N terminus a DXDX(T/V) motif in which the first Asp is phosphorylated during catalysis. Although not so structurally similar to cN-II to be related by a simple sequence analysis investigation, most of these enzymes present a phosphotransferase-phosphatase activity, a common catalytic dependence from Mg2+ and the occurrence of a phosphointermediate. As shown in Fig. 6, all the proteins listed have the common motif flanked by almost conserved hydrophobic amino acids. A few months ago, the three-dimensional structure of the first member of this family, phosphoserine phosphatase fromMethanococcus jannaschii, had been solved by x-ray crystallography (33Wang W. Kim R. Jancarik J. Yokota H. Kim S.H. Structure. 2001; 9: 65-71Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). This enzyme presents a fold consisting of separate α/β and four-helix-bundle domains. A careful structural analysis revealed the simultaneous occurrence of four acid residues into its active site. Asp-11 is important in playing the role of phosphate acceptor; similarly, Asp-13, Asp-167, and Glu-20 seem to be essential for Mg2+ coordination. Site-directed mutagenesis experiments revealed the importance of these residues in catalysis. The data reported in this paper on the stoichiometry of the cN-II inactivation by WRK demonstrate that, also in this case, four acid residues are modified with the same efficiency. Inactivation is protected by enzyme substrates and inhibitors, suggesting that modified residues are located into the active site. In addition, both Asp residues occurring in the DXDX(T/V) motif of cN-II (Asp-52 and Asp-54), similar to that of phosphoserine phosphatase (Asp-11 and Asp-13), are essential for catalysis. Therefore, these data are in strict analogy with that determined for phosphoserine phosphatase and suggest that also in cN-II the occurrence of different acid residues in the active site is important for Mg2+ coordination and catalytic efficiency.Furthermore, sequence comparison of cN-II with other nucleotidases demonstrates that also pyrimidine nucleotidase purified from human erythrocytes (PN-I) and 5′-3′-deoxynucleotidase located in the cytoplasm (dNT-1) and in its mitochondrial counterpart (dNT-2), contain a DXDX(T/V) motif. Also human cN-I shows a similar sequence even though located close to the C terminus. Pyrimidine nucleotidase PN-I has been shown to have a phosphotransferase activity (11Amici A. Emanuelli M. Magni G. Raffaelli N. Ruggeri S. FEBS Lett. 1997; 419: 263-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), which implicates a reaction mechanism proceeding through a phosphorylated enzyme intermediate. In the case of dNT-1 and dNT-2, the reaction mechanism has not been described so far. The two enzymes present a high degree of identity in their structure and molecular and functional characteristics, suggesting that they act through the same mechanism. dNT-1 has been recently cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli and mammalian cells (8Rampazzo C.

Chem. 2000; 275: 5409-5415Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) and was found remarkably similar to PN-II described in human erythrocytes concluding that PN-II, which is a phosphatase/phosphotransferase (11Amici A. Emanuelli M. Magni G. Raffaelli N. Ruggeri S. FEBS Lett. 1997; 419: 263-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), actually belongs to the class of the dNT's (8Rampazzo C. Johansson M.

Furthermore, substrate specificity of dNT-1 is remarkably similar to that displayed by the phosphotransferase with hydrolase activity acting on deoxynucleotides described by Tesoriere etal. (34Tesoriere G. Vento R. Tesoriere L. Giuliano M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1984; 786: 231-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Human cN-I has been recently cloned (35Hunsucker S.A. Spychala J. Mitchell B.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 10498-10504Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), but its reaction mechanism has not been described so far. However its functional similarities with cN-II (such as the complete Mg2+ dependence) suggest that it might have a similar reaction mechanism. Therefore, on the basis of these observations and the sequence alignment reported in Fig. 6 we can presumably assume that catalysis of all soluble nucleotidases proceed through a similar reaction mechanism involving the formation of a phosphorylated intermediate. Therefore, we conclude that cN-II is a first example of a group of eukaryotic cytosolic nucleotidases presenting a common catalytic machinery and conserved active site residues that resemble those occurring in other enzymes belonging to the superfamily of bacterial, eukaryotic and archeal phosphohydrolases (15Collet J.F.

Structure. 2001; 9: 65-71Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Hydrolysis of the phosphate esterified in 3′ or 5′ of mononucleotides is catalyzed by a family of nucleotidases whose members differ in terms of substrate specificity, cellular location, regulation, distribution, and amino acid sequence. A better knowledge of the structure and catalytic mechanism of all these proteins is necessary for the understanding of their origin, evolution, and physiological significance. A classification of the enzymes specific for purine 5′-mononucleotides has been proposed by Zimmerman on the basis of cellular location and substrate specificity (1Zimmerman H. Biochem. J. 1992; 285: 345-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (748) Google Scholar). In vertebrates, there is a membrane-bound 5′-nucleotidase and two cytosolic 5′-nucleotidases that preferentially hydrolyses purine mononucleotides, one specific for AMP (cN-I)1 and the other specific for IMP and GMP (cN-II). Moreover, other nucleotidases specific for 5′- and 3′-deoxynucleotides located in cytosol (dNT-1) or in mitochondria (dNT-2) have been described (2Hoglund L. Reichard P. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 6589-6595Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 3Rampazzo C. Gallinaro L. Milanesi E. Frigimelica E. Reichard P. Bianchi V. Proc. Natl. Acad.

Bhagwat A.S. J. Protein Chem. 1993; 12: 451-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar, 30Bustos P. Gajardo M.I. Gomez C. Goldie H. Cardemil E. Jabalquinto A.M. J.

The partial protection exerted by substrates and inhibitors of the enzyme is strongly indicative that some of the modified residues are located in the active site. It was previously observed that the allosteric inhibitor phosphate causes an increase in the Km for IMP, suggesting that the cN-II active site can result less accessibly in the presence of this anion. On the contrary, has been reported that the allosteric activator ATP, in the presence of Mg2+ causes a moderate decrease in theKm for the substrate and an increase in the catalytic rate (32Pesi R. Turriani M. Allegrini S. Scolozzi C. Camici M. Ipata P.L. Tozzi M.G. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1994; 312: 75-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). We find here that phosphate is effective in protection against WRK inactivation, while ATP-Mg2+, which increase the accessibility of the active site, do not exert any protective effect. On the contrary, ATP in the absence of Mg2+ indeed afforded a protection similar to that observed for IMP. ATP is also stabilizing the enzyme during storage and against thermal inactivation (12Itoh R. Echizen H. Higuchi M. Oka J. Yamada K. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. 1992; 103B: 153-159Google Scholar). These observations indicate that, in the absence of Mg2+, ATP can determine a protective effect possibly by an interaction with the active site. In a previous paper we demonstrated that cN-II forms a phosphoenzyme intermediate during catalysis, which was extremely labile (10Baiocchi C. Pesi R. Camici M. Itoh R. Tozzi M.G. Biochem. J. 1996; 317: 797-801Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). On the basis of this observation and the enzyme sensitivity toward treatment with WRK, we deduced that an aspartate or glutamate residue was the phosphate acceptor. The identification of this amino acid has been obtained after reduction of the acyl phosphate intermediate with radiolabeled borohydride, and separation of its tryptic digest, radioactivity, and molecular mass measurements. Sequence analysis performed on the isolated peptide demonstrated that Asp-52 was the phosphorylated residue. Site-directed mutagenesis experiments confirmed the fundamental role of this residue for the enzyme activity; in fact, even a conservative substitution in this position totally abolished enzyme activity and prevented the formation of the phosphorylated enzyme. In addition, mutants on Asp-54 were inactive and not able to generate this intermediate. On this basis, our results demonstrate that cN-II belongs to the large class of phosphohydrolases described by Collet et al. (15Collet J.F. Stroobant V. Pirard M. Delpierre G. Van Schaftingen E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14107-14112Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar) because it shows close to the N terminus a DXDX(T/V) motif in which the first Asp is phosphorylated during catalysis. Although not so structurally similar to cN-II to be related by a simple sequence analysis investigation, most of these enzymes present a phosphotransferase-phosphatase activity, a common catalytic dependence from Mg2+ and the occurrence of a phosphointermediate. As shown in Fig. 6, all the proteins listed have the common motif flanked by almost conserved hydrophobic amino acids. A few months ago, the three-dimensional structure of the first member of this family, phosphoserine phosphatase fromMethanococcus jannaschii, had been solved by x-ray crystallography (33Wang W. Kim R. Jancarik J. Yokota H. Kim S.H. Structure. 2001; 9: 65-71Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). This enzyme presents a fold consisting of separate α/β and four-helix-bundle domains. A careful structural analysis revealed the simultaneous occurrence of four acid residues into its active site. Asp-11 is important in playing the role of phosphate acceptor; similarly, Asp-13, Asp-167, and Glu-20 seem to be essential for Mg2+ coordination. Site-directed mutagenesis experiments revealed the importance of these residues in catalysis. The data reported in this paper on the stoichiometry of the cN-II inactivation by WRK demonstrate that, also in this case, four acid residues are modified with the same efficiency. Inactivation is protected by enzyme substrates and inhibitors, suggesting that modified residues are located into the active site. In addition, both Asp residues occurring in the DXDX(T/V) motif of cN-II (Asp-52 and Asp-54), similar to that of phosphoserine phosphatase (Asp-11 and Asp-13), are essential for catalysis. Therefore, these data are in strict analogy with that determined for phosphoserine phosphatase and suggest that also in cN-II the occurrence of different acid residues in the active site is important for Mg2+ coordination and catalytic efficiency. Furthermore, sequence comparison of cN-II with other nucleotidases demonstrates that also pyrimidine nucleotidase purified from human erythrocytes (PN-I) and 5′-3′-deoxynucleotidase located in the cytoplasm (dNT-1) and in its mitochondrial counterpart (dNT-2), contain a DXDX(T/V) motif. Also human cN-I shows a similar sequence even though located close to the C terminus. Pyrimidine nucleotidase PN-I has been shown to have a phosphotransferase activity (11Amici A. Emanuelli M. Magni G. Raffaelli N. Ruggeri S. FEBS Lett. 1997; 419: 263-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), which implicates a reaction mechanism proceeding through a phosphorylated enzyme intermediate. In the case of dNT-1 and dNT-2, the reaction mechanism has not been described so far. The two enzymes present a high degree of identity in their structure and molecular and functional characteristics, suggesting that they act through the same mechanism. dNT-1 has been recently cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli and mammalian cells (8Rampazzo C. Johansson M. Gallinaro L. Ferraro P. Hellman U. Karlsson A. Reichard P. Bianchi V. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5409-5415Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) and was found remarkably similar to PN-II described in human erythrocytes concluding that PN-II, which is a phosphatase/phosphotransferase (11Amici A. Emanuelli M. Magni G. Raffaelli N. Ruggeri S. FEBS Lett. 1997; 419: 263-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), actually belongs to the class of the dNT's (8Rampazzo C. Johansson M.

Furthermore, substrate specificity of dNT-1 is remarkably similar to that displayed by the phosphotransferase with hydrolase activity acting on deoxynucleotides described by Tesoriere etal. (34Tesoriere G. Vento R. Tesoriere L. Giuliano M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1984; 786: 231-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Human cN-I has been recently cloned (35Hunsucker S.A. Spychala J. Mitchell B.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 10498-10504Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), but its reaction mechanism has not been described so far. However its functional similarities with cN-II (such as the complete Mg2+ dependence) suggest that it might have a similar reaction mechanism. Therefore, on the basis of these observations and the sequence alignment reported in Fig. 6 we can presumably assume that catalysis of all soluble nucleotidases proceed through a similar reaction mechanism involving the formation of a phosphorylated intermediate. Therefore, we conclude that cN-II is a first example of a group of eukaryotic cytosolic nucleotidases presenting a common catalytic machinery and conserved active site residues that resemble those occurring in other enzymes belonging to the superfamily of bacterial, eukaryotic and archeal phosphohydrolases (15Collet J.F.

Sequence comparison studies indicate that each of the five Rfc subunits has an ATP-binding domain (reviewed in Ref. 1Cullmann G. Fien K. Kobayashi R. Stillman B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4661-4671Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). The ATP-binding motif present in each of these five subunits represents a structural domain that may also function in ATP binding and/or hydrolysis. The prototypic structure for this domain is theEscherichia coli δ subunit of the γ-complex (2Guenther B. Onrust R. Sali A. O'Donnell M. Kuriyan J. Cell. 1997; 91: 335-345Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar, 3Neuwald A.F. Aravind L. Spouge J.L. Koonin E.V. Genome Res. 1999; 9: 27-43Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The structure of δ is C-shaped with the Walker A and B motifs situated at the base near the hinge of the C. Although it has imperfect ATP-binding motifs and does not bind ATP, the δ protein has high sequence similarity to the γ subunit, the active ATPase of the γ-complex, and therefore the structures of these two proteins are expected to be similar. Sequence comparisons between the five RFC subunits and δ suggest that they may have a similar structure, at least in the base and hinge of the C. From this structure one can easily visualize how ATP binding could cause a conformational change in the entire protein. The top and base of the C clamp are only connected by a small hinge region, giving the overall structure some flexibility. ATP binding could result in an opening or closing of the C, which could be transmitted to the other subunits within the complex, resulting in an overall conformational change in RFC or the γ-complex (2Guenther B. Onrust R. Sali A. O'Donnell M. Kuriyan J. Cell. 1997; 91: 335-345Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar).The studies in the previous paper (4Gomes X.V. Gary Schmidt S.L. Burgers P.M. J. Biol.

In agreement with these experimental results are sequence comparison studies indicating that the Rfc1–Rfc4 subunits contain consensus ATP-binding motifs (see Fig. 1). The Walker A consensus sequence is GXXXXGKT, in which the lysine is invariant (5Walker J.E. Saraste M. Runswick M.J. Gay N.J. EMBO J. 1982; 1: 945-951Crossref PubMed Scopus (4223) Google Scholar). This lysine coordinates oxygens on the β and γ phosphates of ATP (6Parsonage D. Al-Shawi M.K. Senior A. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 4740-4744Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7Fry D.C. Kuby S.A. Mildvan A.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 907-911Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). The B motif (ΦΦΦΦDE), in which Φ is M, L, I, or V, is essential for chelation of the divalent metal ion (7Fry D.C. Kuby S.A. Mildvan A.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 907-911Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). The Rfc1–Rfc4 subunits contain both consensus motifs, whereas the Rfc5 subunit lacks critical residues in both the A and B motifs (see Fig. 1). As with the δ′ subunit of the E. coliγ-complex, the ATP-binding domain in Rfc5p likely is of structural importance rather than to bind ATP (2Guenther B. Onrust R. Sali A. O'Donnell M. Kuriyan J. Cell. 1997; 91: 335-345Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar).The observation that four molecules of ATP bind to a loading-competent complex of RFC with PCNA and DNA does not necessarily imply that binding and/or hydrolysis of all four ATPs is required for clamp loading. Because the four-subunit Rfc2–5 core complex can form alternative complexes, e.g. with Rad24p, it may well be the case that ATP binding to some subunit(s) is related to these alternative functions rather than loading of PCNA (8Green C.M. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Lowndes N.F. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 39-42Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). A mutational analysis of the ATP-binding domains of these subunits may address this issue. Recently, mutational studies of the ATP-binding sites of the subunits of human RFC have been carried out. In one study, mutation to alanine of the conserved lysine in the Walker A motif in each of the human Rfc subunits, except for human Rfc5, greatly diminished or almost completely abolished clamp loading (9Cai J.

In another study, the same lysine was mutagenized to glutamic acid in all subunits, again showing severe defects both in complex stability and activity in all mutants, except for that in Rfc5 (10Podust V.N.

Development. 2000; 127: 155-166Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).In this report we show that the renin gene contains a functional HOX·PBX binding site in its promoter region. Homeodomain proteins PBX1b and HOX family members (preferentially HOX9 and -10) can bind this element in vitro and in As4.1 cells. Both PBX and HOX binding sites are necessary for the expression of theRen-1c gene. Moreover, we have demonstrated that PREP1 can form a ternary complex with HOX and PBX1b on this site.DISCUSSIONIn this report, we have demonstrated that the PPE of the renin gene is a HOX·PBX heterodimer binding site. First, the nucleotide sequences of PPE match perfectly to those of the HOX·PBX heterodimer recognition site. Second, Abd-B HOX9 and -10 members and PBX1b were shown to bind this element with high affinity in vitro. Finally, point mutation of a critical nucleotide either in the HOX or PBX half-site showed the expected effects on HOX·PBX binding in EMSA. In addition, these mutations dramatically reduced the transcriptional activity of Ren-1c gene suggesting that both PBX and HOX half-sites are necessary for renin gene expression.The human renin PPE was previously identified as a Pit-1 site in GC cells (40Sun J. Oddoux C. Lazarus A. Gilbert M.T. Catanzaro D.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1505-1508Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, our results have shown that the PPE in the mouse renin promoter is not a Pit-1 binding site (12Petrovic N. Black T.A. Fabian J.R. Kane C.M. Jones C.A. Loudon J.A. Abonia J.P. Sigmund C.D. Gross K.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22499-22505Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). The PPE in mouse is a poor consensus for Pit-1. Moreover, the As4.1 cell nuclear proteins were not capable of binding to a human Pit-1 consensus oligonucleotide. Furthermore, the major nuclear protein complex from As4.1 cells formed on mouse Ren-1c PPE could not be competed by the Pit-1 oligonucleotide, although it could be competed by the oligonucleotide containing the human PPE. These observations suggest that in As4.1 cells the primary proteins binding to the PPE are HOX and PBX, not Pit-1. Whether HOX and PBX proteins bind to the human PPE in GC cells has not been examined.A direct test of whether HOXD10 protein is involved in the formation of the ternary complex on the mouse PPE in supershift assays has not been possible because of the unavailability of specific antibody. However, other evidence suggests that HOXD10 is a major HOX protein binding to the PPE in As4.1 cells. HOXD10 is expressed in As4.1 cells. Moreover, in the presence of PBX1b, HOXD10 binds to the PPE in EMSA with higher affinity compared with other selected HOX paralog members, and the size of the complex mimics the endogenous complex formed in As4.1 cell nuclear extracts. Furthermore, a small amount of in vitrosynthesized HOXD10 was capable of forming the HOXD10·PBX1b·PREP1 complex with endogenous PBX and PREP1. However, we cannot rule out a redundant role for other HOX family members such as HOX9 members, which are also expressed in As4.1 cells and recognize the same sequence motifs as HOXD10. Recent evidence suggests that although different HOX·PBX heterodimers have preferred sites in vitro, this binding specificity is not always utilized in vivo (41Li X. Veraksa A. McGinnis W. Development. 1999; 126: 5581-5589PubMed Google Scholar, 42White R.A.H. Aspland S.E. Brookman J.J. Clayton L. Sproat G. Mech. Dev. 2000; 91: 217-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that the specificity of a HOX·PBX site might be affected by cofactor binding sites. Thus, the study of renin gene expression in mice lacking different HOX proteins will be helpful in identifying the specific HOX family members necessary for renin expression.We showed that overexpression of HOXD10, PBX1b, PREP1, or various combinations was not able to activate a promoter containing three copies of Ren-1c PPE. These results are in agreement with previous results reported by Shen et al. (32Shen W.F. Rozenfeld S. Kwong A. Komuves L.A. Lawrence H.J. Largman C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 3051-3061Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar) and Shanmugam et al. (33Shanmugam K. Green N.C. Rambaldi I. Saragovi H.U. Featherstone M.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7577-7588Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar) that HOX·PBX·MEIS complex does not exhibit transcriptional activity on artificial promoters containing HOX·PBX binding sites. Thus, other cofactor binding sites may be necessary in the natural targets for the function of HOX·PBX·PREP1/MEIS. We also cotransfected −4.1R1 with HOXD10, PBX1b, PREP1, or various combinations into As4.1 cells. The results showed that the transcriptional activity of the reporter gene was not affected by co-expression of these proteins (data not shown). It is possible that a cofactor, which is necessary for HOX·PBX·PREP1-mediated expression from −4.1R1, is limiting. Therefore, overexpression of HOX· PBX·PREP1 would not further result in an increase in transcriptional activity. When the VP16 activation domain is attached to either HOXD10, PBX1b, or PREP1, it can substitute for the limiting cofactor to activate expression from construct 3XR1-TA.How the PPE bound HOX·PBX1b·PREP1 complex interacts with other required transcriptional factors to regulate the mouse renin gene expression remains to be elucidated. It is possible that the PPE-binding proteins directly interact with a factor binding to an element located within or immediately outside the renal enhancer region located at −2.6 kb to bring the enhancer closer to the TATA box by looping out. Recent findings by Ryoo et al. (35Ryoo H.D. Marty T. Casares F. Affolter M. Mann R.S. Development. 1999; 126: 5137-5148Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), Ferrettiet al. (36Ferretti E. Marshell H. Popperi H. Maconochies M. Krumlauf R. Blasi F. Development. 2000; 127: 155-166Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and Jacob et al. (34Jacobs Y. Schnabel C.A. Clearly M.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 5134-5142Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar) have demonstrated that the vertebrate HoxB2 r4 orDrosophila labial (lab) gene enhancer contains a MEIS/PREP1 (or Drosophila homolog HTH) binding site located almost one compete turn of the helix away from a HOX·PBX site. The MEIS/PREP1/HTH site is required for the HOX·PBX·MEIS/PREP1 or HTH ternary complex formation. However, there is no PREP1/MEIS site found adjacent to the PPE in the Ren-1c gene. Interestingly, surveys of the 4.1-kb Ren-1cflanking sequences for PREP1/MEIS or PBX·PREP1/MEIS sites have revealed two such sites in proximity to the enhancer region. One of these MEIS/PREP1 sites may interact with the HOX·PBX site in the promoter region through the formation of the HOX·PBX·PREP1/MEIS ternary complex to bring the enhancer close to the transcriptional apparatus.A recent report by Saleh et al. (43Saleh M. Rambaldi I. Yang X.-J. Featherstone M.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 8623-8633Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar) suggests that the HOX·PBX complex recruits the coactivator CREB-binding protein to activate gene expression. A CREB/cAMP-response element modulator protein binding site within the Ren-1c enhancer located at −2.6 kb is critical for the enhancer function. 2L. Pan and K. W. Gross, unpublished data. Deletion or mutation of the CREB/cAMP-response element modulator protein binding site results in complete loss of enhancer activity. It is thus possible that the PPE bound HOX·PBX complex indirectly interacts with the CREB site within the enhancer through a common CREB-binding protein coactivator to activate Ren-1c gene expression.These findings strongly imply that renin and in larger scope the renin-angiotensin system are immediate downstream targets of the Class I Hox developmental control genes. As such, the production of angiotensin II, a classical pressor substance that also exhibits growth factor activities as mediated through the AT1 and AT2 receptor system (44De Gasparo M. Catt K.J. Inagami T. Wright J.W. Unger T. Pharmacol. Rev. 2000; 52: 415-471PubMed Google Scholar), is regulated by an important class of developmental patterning genes. The mammalian metanephric kidney is but one of three phylogenetically and ontogenetically discernable kidneys that arise at different points along the anterior-posterior body axis in vertebrates. Intriguingly the preferred recognition sequence for the HOX paralogs expressed at these points on the body axis is precisely that found in the PPE of the renin genes, and renin gene expression has been noted in vascular tissues of pronephric and mesonephric as well as metanephric kidneys (45Wilson J.X. Endocr. Rev. 1984; 5: 45-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 46Schutz S. Le Moullec J.-M. Corvol P. Gasc J.-M. Am. J. Pathol. 1996; 149: 2067-2079PubMed Google Scholar). Renin is an aspartyl protease, which, as part of the renin-angiotensin system, plays a critical role in the maintenance of blood pressure and electrolyte balance by converting angiotensinogen to angiotensin I (1Griendling K.K. Murphy T.J. Alexander R.W. Circulation. 1993; 87: 1816-1828Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). Additionally, the renin-angiotensin system has been implicated in aspects of renal development by the observation that pharmacological and genetic disruptions of renin-angiotensin system function result in aberrant renal morphology (for reviews, see Refs. 2Gomez R.A. Kidney Int. 1998; 54: 512-516Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Google Scholar, 3Nishimura H. Ichikawa I. Intern. Med. 1999; 38: 315-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 4Wintour E.M.

Gross K.W. Hypertension. 1991; 18: 446-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). In murine fetuses, kidney renin transcripts can be detected as early as 14.5 days post coitum in the newly developing arteries (6Jones C.A. Sigmund C.D. McGowan R.A. Kane C.M. Gross K.W. Mol. Endocrinol. 1990; 4: 375-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar).

Homeodomain proteins PBX1b and HOX family members (preferentially HOX9 and -10) can bind this element in vitro and in As4.1 cells. Both PBX and HOX binding sites are necessary for the expression of theRen-1c gene. Moreover, we have demonstrated that PREP1 can form a ternary complex with HOX and PBX1b on this site. DISCUSSIONIn this report, we have demonstrated that the PPE of the renin gene is a HOX·PBX heterodimer binding site. First, the nucleotide sequences of PPE match perfectly to those of the HOX·PBX heterodimer recognition site. Second, Abd-B HOX9 and -10 members and PBX1b were shown to bind this element with high affinity in vitro. Finally, point mutation of a critical nucleotide either in the HOX or PBX half-site showed the expected effects on HOX·PBX binding in EMSA. In addition, these mutations dramatically reduced the transcriptional activity of Ren-1c gene suggesting that both PBX and HOX half-sites are necessary for renin gene expression.The human renin PPE was previously identified as a Pit-1 site in GC cells (40Sun J. Oddoux C. Lazarus A. Gilbert M.T. Catanzaro D.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1505-1508Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, our results have shown that the PPE in the mouse renin promoter is not a Pit-1 binding site (12Petrovic N. Black T.A. Fabian J.R. Kane C.M. Jones C.A. Loudon J.A. Abonia J.P. Sigmund C.D. Gross K.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22499-22505Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). The PPE in mouse is a poor consensus for Pit-1. Moreover, the As4.1 cell nuclear proteins were not capable of binding to a human Pit-1 consensus oligonucleotide. Furthermore, the major nuclear protein complex from As4.1 cells formed on mouse Ren-1c PPE could not be competed by the Pit-1 oligonucleotide, although it could be competed by the oligonucleotide containing the human PPE. These observations suggest that in As4.1 cells the primary proteins binding to the PPE are HOX and PBX, not Pit-1. Whether HOX and PBX proteins bind to the human PPE in GC cells has not been examined.A direct test of whether HOXD10 protein is involved in the formation of the ternary complex on the mouse PPE in supershift assays has not been possible because of the unavailability of specific antibody. However, other evidence suggests that HOXD10 is a major HOX protein binding to the PPE in As4.1 cells. HOXD10 is expressed in As4.1 cells. Moreover, in the presence of PBX1b, HOXD10 binds to the PPE in EMSA with higher affinity compared with other selected HOX paralog members, and the size of the complex mimics the endogenous complex formed in As4.1 cell nuclear extracts. Furthermore, a small amount of in vitrosynthesized HOXD10 was capable of forming the HOXD10·PBX1b·PREP1 complex with endogenous PBX and PREP1. However, we cannot rule out a redundant role for other HOX family members such as HOX9 members, which are also expressed in As4.1 cells and recognize the same sequence motifs as HOXD10. Recent evidence suggests that although different HOX·PBX heterodimers have preferred sites in vitro, this binding specificity is not always utilized in vivo (41Li X. Veraksa A. McGinnis W. Development. 1999; 126: 5581-5589PubMed Google Scholar, 42White R.A.H. Aspland S.E. Brookman J.J. Clayton L. Sproat G. Mech. Dev. 2000; 91: 217-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that the specificity of a HOX·PBX site might be affected by cofactor binding sites. Thus, the study of renin gene expression in mice lacking different HOX proteins will be helpful in identifying the specific HOX family members necessary for renin expression.We showed that overexpression of HOXD10, PBX1b, PREP1, or various combinations was not able to activate a promoter containing three copies of Ren-1c PPE. These results are in agreement with previous results reported by Shen et al. (32Shen W.F. Rozenfeld S. Kwong A. Komuves L.A. Lawrence H.J. Largman C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 3051-3061Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar) and Shanmugam et al. (33Shanmugam K. Green N.C. Rambaldi I. Saragovi H.U. Featherstone M.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7577-7588Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar) that HOX·PBX·MEIS complex does not exhibit transcriptional activity on artificial promoters containing HOX·PBX binding sites. Thus, other cofactor binding sites may be necessary in the natural targets for the function of HOX·PBX·PREP1/MEIS. We also cotransfected −4.1R1 with HOXD10, PBX1b, PREP1, or various combinations into As4.1 cells. The results showed that the transcriptional activity of the reporter gene was not affected by co-expression of these proteins (data not shown). It is possible that a cofactor, which is necessary for HOX·PBX·PREP1-mediated expression from −4.1R1, is limiting. Therefore, overexpression of HOX· PBX·PREP1 would not further result in an increase in transcriptional activity. When the VP16 activation domain is attached to either HOXD10, PBX1b, or PREP1, it can substitute for the limiting cofactor to activate expression from construct 3XR1-TA.How the PPE bound HOX·PBX1b·PREP1 complex interacts with other required transcriptional factors to regulate the mouse renin gene expression remains to be elucidated. It is possible that the PPE-binding proteins directly interact with a factor binding to an element located within or immediately outside the renal enhancer region located at −2.6 kb to bring the enhancer closer to the TATA box by looping out. Recent findings by Ryoo et al. (35Ryoo H.D. Marty T. Casares F. Affolter M. Mann R.S. Development. 1999; 126: 5137-5148Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), Ferrettiet al. (36Ferretti E. Marshell H.

Biol. 1999; 19: 5134-5142Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar) have demonstrated that the vertebrate HoxB2 r4 orDrosophila labial (lab) gene enhancer contains a MEIS/PREP1 (or Drosophila homolog HTH) binding site located almost one compete turn of the helix away from a HOX·PBX site. The MEIS/PREP1/HTH site is required for the HOX·PBX·MEIS/PREP1 or HTH ternary complex formation. However, there is no PREP1/MEIS site found adjacent to the PPE in the Ren-1c gene. Interestingly, surveys of the 4.1-kb Ren-1cflanking sequences for PREP1/MEIS or PBX·PREP1/MEIS sites have revealed two such sites in proximity to the enhancer region. One of these MEIS/PREP1 sites may interact with the HOX·PBX site in the promoter region through the formation of the HOX·PBX·PREP1/MEIS ternary complex to bring the enhancer close to the transcriptional apparatus.A recent report by Saleh et al. (43Saleh M. Rambaldi I. Yang X.-J. Featherstone M.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 8623-8633Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar) suggests that the HOX·PBX complex recruits the coactivator CREB-binding protein to activate gene expression. A CREB/cAMP-response element modulator protein binding site within the Ren-1c enhancer located at −2.6 kb is critical for the enhancer function. 2L. Pan and K. W. Gross, unpublished data. Deletion or mutation of the CREB/cAMP-response element modulator protein binding site results in complete loss of enhancer activity. It is thus possible that the PPE bound HOX·PBX complex indirectly interacts with the CREB site within the enhancer through a common CREB-binding protein coactivator to activate Ren-1c gene expression.These findings strongly imply that renin and in larger scope the renin-angiotensin system are immediate downstream targets of the Class I Hox developmental control genes. As such, the production of angiotensin II, a classical pressor substance that also exhibits growth factor activities as mediated through the AT1 and AT2 receptor system (44De Gasparo M. Catt K.J. Inagami T. Wright J.W. Unger T. Pharmacol. Rev. 2000; 52: 415-471PubMed Google Scholar), is regulated by an important class of developmental patterning genes. The mammalian metanephric kidney is but one of three phylogenetically and ontogenetically discernable kidneys that arise at different points along the anterior-posterior body axis in vertebrates. Intriguingly the preferred recognition sequence for the HOX paralogs expressed at these points on the body axis is precisely that found in the PPE of the renin genes, and renin gene expression has been noted in vascular tissues of pronephric and mesonephric as well as metanephric kidneys (45Wilson J.X.

Both the N- and C-terminal domains are peptidyl dipeptidases. Hydrolysis by ACE of its decapeptide substrate Ang I is increased by Cl−, but the molecular mechanism of this regulation is unclear. A search for single substitutions to Gln among all conserved basic residues (Lys/Arg) in human ACE C-domain identified R1098Q as the sole mutant that lacked Cl− dependence. Cl−dependence is also lost when the equivalent Arg in the N-domain, Arg500, is substituted with Gln. The Arg1098 to Lys substitution reduced Cl− binding affinity by ∼100-fold. In the absence of Cl−, substrate binding affinity (1/Km) of and catalytic efficiency (kcat/Km) for Ang I hydrolysis are increased 6.9- and 32-fold, respectively, by the Arg1098 to Gln substitution, and are similar (<2-fold difference) to the respective wild-type C-domain catalytic constants in the presence of optimal [Cl−]. The Arg1098to Gln substitution also eliminates Cl− dependence for hydrolysis of tetrapeptide substrates, but activity toward these substrates is similar to that of the wild-type C-domain in the absence of Cl−. These findings indicate that: 1) Arg1098 is a critical residue of the C-domain Cl−-binding site and 2) a basic side chain is necessary for Cl− dependence. For tetrapeptide substrates, the inability of R1098Q to recreate the high affinity state generated by the Cl−-C-domain interaction suggests that substrate interactions with the enzyme-bound Cl− are much more important for the hydrolysis of short substrates than for Ang I. Since Cl− concentrations are saturating under physiological conditions and Arg1098 is not critical for Ang I hydrolysis, we speculate that the evolutionary pressure for the maintenance of the Cl−-binding site is its ability to allow cleavage of short cognate peptide substrates at high catalytic efficiencies.

Rawlings N.D. Woessner J.F. Barrett A.J. Rawlings N.D. Woessner J.F. Handbook of Proteolytic Enzymes. Academic Press, New York1998: 992-993Google Scholar). Peptide hydrolysis is activated by monovalent anions such as Cl−; this feature is unique among metalloproteases (2Corvol P. Williams T.A. Barrett A.J. Rawlings N.D. Woessner J.F. Handbook of Proteolytic Enzymes. Academic Press, New York1998: 1066-1076Google Scholar). The somatic form of human ACE has two homologous catalytic domains. These N- and C-domains most likely are the result of an ancient gene duplication event that occurred during vertebrate evolution (3Soubrier F. Alhenc-Gelas F. Hubert C. Allegrini J. John M.

J. 1996; 314: 639-646Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The physiological substrates of ACE include Ang I, bradykinin, substance P, and AcSDKP (2Corvol P. Williams T.A. Barrett A.J. Rawlings N.D. Woessner J.F. Handbook of Proteolytic Enzymes. Academic Press, New York1998: 1066-1076Google Scholar); however, there are significant differences between the catalytic domains in catalytic efficiencies for the hydrolysis of these substrates (6Wei L. Ahlenc-Gelas F. Corvol P. Clauser E. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 9002-9008Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7Jaspard E. Wei L. Alhenc-Gelas F. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9496-9503Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cl− dependence of hydrolysis is substrate-specific. For example, the degree of enzyme activation by Cl− and its apparent dissociation constant (Kd,app) associated with this activation is high for Ang I and low for bradykinin (8Bunning P. Riordan J.F. Biochemistry. 1983; 22: 110-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 9Shapiro R. Holmquist B. Riordan J.F. Biochemistry. 1983; 22: 3850-3857Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). To define the molecular determinants in the substrate structure responsible for these differences, Riordan and colleagues (8Bunning P. Riordan J.F. Biochemistry. 1983; 22: 110-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 9Shapiro R. Holmquist B. Riordan J.F. Biochemistry. 1983; 22: 3850-3857Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) studied the hydrolysis of a collection of tripeptide substrates with varying C-terminal dipeptide structures. They observed that a P1′- or P2′-(Arg/Lys) 2The nomenclature used for the individual amino acids (P1, P1′, etc.) of a substrate and the subsites (S1, S1′, etc.) of the enzyme is that of Schechter and Berger (23Schechter I.

Amino acid residues of substrates numbered P1, P2, etc., are towards the N-terminal direction, and P1′, P2′ etc., are towards the C-terminal direction from the scissile bond. in the tripeptide substrate was necessary and sufficient for high affinity Cl− binding. Bradykinin, like these substrates, but unlike Ang I, contains a basic residue in its C-terminal dipeptide. Also, hydrolytic activity of ACE for tripeptide substrates with a P1′- or P2′-(Arg/Lys) is less affected by Cl− than for those that lack a basic P1′ or P2′ residue. Because chemical modification of ACE that leads to methylation of Lys residues has selective effects on hydrolytic activity for furanacryloyl-FGG-COO−(inactivated by >99%) and furanacryloyl-FFR-COO−(activity reduced by ∼50%) it was proposed that a critical Lys is part of the Cl−-binding site of ACE (10Shapiro R. Riordan J.F. Biochemistry. 1983; 22: 5315-5321Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The study by Shapiro and Riordan (10Shapiro R. Riordan J.F. Biochemistry. 1983; 22: 5315-5321Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) had provided only circumstantial evidence that a critical Lys was involved in Cl− binding, and in principle it is best to consider both types of basic residues as possibilities. To identify the Cl−-binding residue(s) in ACE we made single substitutions with Gln of all conserved arginines or lysines in the human ACE C-domain. Here we show that the primary site of Cl− binding in the C-domain is Arg1098irrespective of whether the substrate is the decapeptide Ang I or a short peptide with or without a basic residue at its C terminus. We show for the first time that anion-substrate interactions are critical for the hydrolysis of short substrates suggesting that the substrate itself forms an important part of the Cl−-binding site. Finally, kinetic studies with position 1098 C-domain mutants provide insights into the molecular mechanism of ACE activation by Cl−. Homology between exons 4–11 and exons 17–24 in the human ACE gene was established by Hubert et al. (4Hubert C. Houot A.M. Corvol P. Soubrier F. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15377-15383Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Nucleotide sequence similarity between these exons exceeds 54%. Lower stringency dot matrix plots indicated that the duplicated region extends further at both the N- and C-terminal ends (data not shown). Sequence alignment supports the proposition that the duplicated region of the ACE gene is more extensive than that previously realized. Exons 1–3 (except DNA coding for the signal peptide and 7 residues at the N terminus of exon 1) are homologous to exons 14–16 and exon 12 is homologous to exon 25. Thus the region of homology consists of exons 1–12 (excluding the signal peptide) and exons 14–25 (Fig. 1). These regions are also homologous to the entire invertebrate ACE. In vertebrate ACE genes, only exons 13 and 26 are not duplicated; the former is spliced onto the N terminus of testicular ACE mRNA and the latter encodes the transmembrane and cytosolic tail domains. Human ACE C- and N-domain gene construct design was based on the region of gene duplication shown in Fig. 1. The gene constructs were made by strategies reported previously (11Fernandez M. Liu X.

Husain A. Science. 1996; 271: 502-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar), chemically synthesized and cloned into the shuttle expression vector pcDNA3 (Invitrogen). The C-domain gene construct encodes amino acids −29 to −1 (signal peptide), 1 to 4, and 611 to 1201 of human somatic ACE (14Sanker S. Chandrasekharan U.M. Wilk D. Glynias M.J. Karnik S.S. Husain A.

Chem. 1997; 272: 2963-2968Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) with an 8-residue FLAG epitope recognized by a commercially available antibody (M2, Sigma) at the C terminus. The N-domain gene construct encodes amino acids −29 to −1 (signal peptide) and 1–609 of human somatic ACE with an 8-residue FLAG epitope at the C terminus. Mutations were constructed in the synthetic gene by the technique of restriction fragment replacement or site-directed mutagenesis (QuikChange Site Directed Mutagenesis Kit, Stratagene), and mutants were fully sequenced (13Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52760) Google Scholar) to check for the presence of intended mutations and the absence of unintended mutations. COS-7 cells (ATCC) were cultured under an atmosphere of 5% CO2 at 37 °C and transfected with plasmid DNA using the Gene Pulser system (Bio-Rad). 12 h after transfection, cells were washed and further cultured with serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) for 48–72 h. C- and N-domains and their mutants released into conditioned media were collected and used as the starting point of the purification. The following mutants were made: K919Q-, R924Q-, R942Q-, R944Q-, K1030Q-, K1044Q-, K1065Q-, K1077Q-, K1087Q-, R1098Q-, and R1098K-C-domain and R500Q-N-domain. An anti-FLAG M2 affinity gel was used to purify recombinant ACE C- and N-domain according to the procedure described by the manufacturer (Sigma). ACE protein preparations were >95% pure as determined by Coomassie Blue staining, and the amount of protein was quantified by amino acid analysis. These preparations of C- and N-domain were used as standards. For kinetic studies, C- and N-domains and their mutants were partially purified by ion exchange HPLC using a Bio-Scale Q2 column (Bio-Rad). Cell culture media containing ACE or mutant ACE protein was dialyzed against 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5, containing 20 mm NaCl. The dialyzed media (5–10 ml) was applied to the ion exchange HPLC column which was developed using a 45-min linear NaCl gradient (20–500 mm) at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. Two to three 1-ml fractions with the highest activity were pooled. The purity of recombinant ACE in the pooled peak fractions was ∼50%, with bovine serum albumin as the only detectable contaminant. ACE was not further purified to remove the contaminating bovine serum albumin since the stability of the pure (>95%) C-domain at 4 °C was markedly lower than that of partially purified ACE containing bovine serum albumin. The concentration of enzyme in each crude or purified C- or N-domain or mutant preparation was quantified by Western blot analysis using a polyclonal antiserum generated against pure human kidney ACE (11Fernandez M. Liu X. Wouters M.A. Heyberger S. Husain A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 4998-5004Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Peptides used in this study were synthesized by The Protein Core Facility, The Cleveland Clinic Foundation, or Auspep (Parkville, Australia). Angiotensin peptides were purified (purity >99%) on a C18 reverse phase HPLC column and characterized by amino acid analysis and analytical C18reverse phase HPLC. Peptide concentrations were determined by amino acid analysis. Tetrapeptide substrates with the structure acetyl-AF-Xaa-Xaa-COO− were synthesized as a library (Chiron Technologies, Clayton, Victoria, Australia) and were of >90% purity; these peptides were used without further purification. A standard AcAF preparation (>99% purity) of known concentration was used to quantify product formation during AcAF-Xaa-Xaa-COO− incubations with ACE. To determineKm and Vmax values for C- and N-domain reactions, initial velocities (v) were determined as described by us previously (11Fernandez M. Liu X. Wouters M.A. Heyberger S. Husain A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 4998-5004Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 14Sanker S. Chandrasekharan U.M. Wilk D. Glynias M.J. Karnik S.S. Husain A. J. Biol.

Twelve concentrations of Ang I ranging between 5 and 1,000 μm or six concentrations of AcAF-Xaa-Xaa-COO− were incubated with wild-type or mutants forms of ACE at 37 °C in 50 mm HEPES buffer, pH 7.5, containing varying concentrations of NaCl and 10 μmZnSO4 (final volume 50 μl) for 30–60 min. Enzyme concentration was adjusted to ensure that <15% of the substrate was consumed at the lowest substrate concentration. Under these conditions, product formation was linear with respect to time over the duration of the incubation. Reactions were terminated by the addition of 70 μl of ice-cold 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. The resulting solution (100 μl) was applied to a C18 reverse phase HPLC column (XTerra RP18 3.5 μm, 4.6 × 50 mm column, Waters, Milford, MA). The column was developed with linear acetonitrile gradients containing either 25 mm triethylammonium phosphate buffer, pH 3.0 or 7.0, or 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid at a flow rate of 2 ml/min. The column effluent was monitored at 230 nm. The elution positions of Ang I, Ang II, and AcAF-COO− were determined using pure synthetic standards. The peak area corresponding to Ang II or AcAF-COO− was integrated to calculate product formation. Products were separated by reverse phase HPLC and identified by amino acid analysis. Km and Vmaxvalues were calculated by nonlinear regression using the equation:v = Vmax × [S]/(Km + [S]). Correlation coefficients were routinely >0.99, but never <0.97. Pure wild-type C- or N-domains of known concentration were used in a Western blot protocol to determine enzyme concentration of partially purified ACE and mutant ACE enzyme preparations. The overall rate constant kcat was calculated by the formula kcat =Vmax/[E0], where [E0] is the total enzyme concentration. Apparent dissociation constants (Kd,app) for Cl− and other anions were calculated from activation curves generated by NaCl titration (or corresponding sodium salt). The saturation curves were computer fitted by a nonlinear regression analysis of the equation: v =Vsat × [A]/(Kd,app + [A]), where [A] is the anion concentration and Vsat is the activity of the enzyme at saturating concentrations of anion. Initial velocities, v, were determined at a [S] < Km and reflectskcat/Km conditions. ΔΔGT‡, ΔΔGbinding, and ΔΔGcat were calculated as described by Wells (15Wells J.A. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 8509-8517Crossref PubMed Scopus (622) Google Scholar). ΔΔGT‡, ΔΔGbinding, and ΔΔGcat represent the difference between two enzymes in the free energy required for transition-state stabilization (i.e. difference in free energy required to reachE[chemp]S‡ from E + S), to form the enzyme-substrate complex (E·S) from E + S, and to convert the E·S complex to the transition-state complex (E·S‡), respectively. Kinetic constants for Ang I conversion to Ang II by C- and N-domains are summarized in TableI. At saturating Cl−concentration levels (20 mm NaCl; Fig.2) the N-domain had an ∼2.5-fold higher catalytic efficiency for Ang I hydrolysis than did the C-domain. This difference was mainly due to a 2-fold lower Km for Ang I hydrolysis by the N-domain.Table IEffect of NaCl on the hydrolysis of Ang I by wild-type- and R1098Q-human ACE C-domain and wild-type and R500Q-human ACE N-domain[NaCl]C-domain ACER1098QΔΔG 1-aFor Km ,kcat, andkcat/Km comparisons, ΔΔG is ΔΔGbinding, ΔΔGcat and ΔΔGT ‡, respectively.

Removal of Cl− by extensive dialysis results in a reversible inactivation of C- and N-domains. Addition of Cl− reactivated these catalytic domains and maximal activity was attained at ∼20 mm NaCl (Fig. 2).Kd,app for Cl− activation of Ang I hydrolysis by C- and N-domains was 0.5 and 1.1 mm, respectively (Figs. 2 and 3). Addition of 20 mm NaCl increased catalytic efficiencies of C- and N-domains for Ang I hydrolysis 55- and 9.3-fold, respectively (TableI). At a concentration of 20 mm, Cl− increased the affinity (1/Km) of Ang I binding to the N- and C-domains to an equivalent level (∼8-fold). The difference between these domains in the Cl− effect on catalytic efficiency was mainly due to differences in catalytic rate enhancement (Cl− increased kcat for the C- and N-domains 6.2- and 1.2-fold, respectively). The C-domain can be fully reactivated not only by Cl− but also by Fl−, Br−, and I− (Fig.3). Activation of this ACE domain by CH3COO−(sodium salt) was <5% of that seen with Cl− (data not shown). The apparent dissociation constants,Kd,app, between halides for the C-domain differed widely (Fig. 3). An inverted bell-shaped relation was seen between ionic size and Kd,app, with Cl− and Br− being the most tightly bound, and I− and Fl− binding with 10–100-fold lower affinity. Cl−-dependent activation of ACE is conserved during ACE evolution. Hence we reasoned that the critical residue responsible for coordinating this Cl− would also be conserved in each ACE domain and between species. In Cl−-activated α-amylases, the negatively charged Cl− is primarily coordinated by the positively charged side chain of either Arg or Lys (16Feller G. le Bussy O. Houssier C. Gerday C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23836-23841Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 17Brayer G.D. Luo Y. Withers S.G. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 1730-1742Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). To identify the Arg or Lys residue responsible for Cl− dependence, all Arg and Lys residues in the C-domain that are conserved in all known ACE primary structures were individually changed to Gln by mutagenesis. The positions of these conserved residues in human ACE are shown in Fig. 1. Conservative substitutions (i.e. Lys in place of Arg, andvice versa) were allowed but none were observed. Six lysines and four arginines are conserved in human ACE C-domain (Fig. 1). These are: Lys919, Arg924, Arg942, Arg944, Lys1030, Lys1044, Lys1065, Lys1077, Lys1087, and Arg1098. Mutants containing a single Gln substitution of these residues were expressed in COS-7 cells. The protein expression level of each mutant, except K1077Q, was >60% of the wild-type enzyme. The expression level of K1077Q was ∼15% of the wild-type enzyme. In these mutations, the glycosylation pattern was unchanged from that in the wild-type enzyme, indicating that their post-translational modification was intact. Enzyme activity of each mutant is shown in Fig.4 A. Following extensive dialysis in Cl−-free buffer, Ang II forming activity of each mutant was examined in 0 or 20 mmNaCl (Fig. 4 B). Like the wild-type C- and N-domains, all C-domain mutants, except R1098Q, exhibited a >10-fold increase in activity associated with the change in Cl− concentration from 0 to 20 mm. In 0 mm NaCl, R1098Q had ∼60% of the activity seen in 20 mm NaCl. The selective loss of Cl− dependence in the Ang I hydrolytic activity of R1098Q suggested that Arg1098 was the Cl−binding residue in the C-domain. The residue in the N-domain, equivalent to Arg1098 of the C-domain, is Arg500. The effect of Cl− on the R1098Q-C-domain and R500Q-N-domain Ang II forming activity is summarized in Table I and Fig. 2. In Ang I hydrolysis assays carried out in the absence of Cl−, the Arg1098 to Gln substitution produced a 6.9-fold decrease inKm , a 4.7-fold increase inkcat, and a 32-fold increase inkcat/Km (ΔΔGT‡ = −2.1 kcal mol−1). Under identical conditions the Arg500to Gln substitution produced a 1.8-fold decrease inKm , a 2.5-fold increase inkcat, and a 4.5-fold increase inkcat/Km (ΔΔGT‡ = −0.76 kcal mol−1). Increasing Cl− concentration levels to 20 mm produced minimal changes in thekcat/Km of Ang I hydrolysis by R1098Q (22% decrease) or R500Q (7.7% decrease). Therefore, the Arg1098 to Gln and Arg500 to Gln substitutions lead to a loss of Cl− dependence (Fig. 2). In the presence of 20 mm NaCl, R1098Q and R500Q had ∼45% of the catalytic efficiency of their respective wild-type controls. The loss of Cl− dependence with the Arg1098 to Gln substitution suggests an ionic interaction between Arg1098and the anion. In structural data bases, ionic interactions between Lys and Cl− have also been described. The effect of the Arg1098 to Lys substitution on halide anion-dependent activation of Ang I hydrolysis is shown in Fig. 3. In the absence of Cl−, the Km ,kcat, andkcat/Km values for Ang I hydrolysis by R1098K were 140 ± 5.6 μm, 1.9 ± 0.07 s−1, and 0.013 s−1μm−1, respectively (n = 3). Affinity (1/Kd,app) of Cl−binding was reduced ∼100-fold by the Arg1098 to Lys substitution. Affinity differences between Cl−, Br−, I−, and Fl− binding to R1098K were minor (<1.7-fold) compared with those observed with the wild-type C-domain (up to 100-fold). With Cl− or Br−, maximal anion-dependent activation of R1098K was ∼10-fold lower than that with wild-type C-domain, but was 33-fold lower with I− and 120-fold lower with Fl−. Short tetrapeptide substrates used in this study were AcAFAR-COO−, AcAFFR-COO−, AcAFHR-COO−, AcAFAK-COO−, AcAFFK-COO−, AcAFHK-COO−, AcAFAG-COO−, AcAFGG-COO−, and AcAFHL-COO−; some of these substrates were based on those used by Shapiro et al. (9Shapiro R. Holmquist B. Riordan J.F. Biochemistry. 1983; 22: 3850-3857Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The effect of Cl−on tetrapeptide substrate hydrolysis by the C-domain is shown in Fig.5 and kinetic constants for Cl− binding (Kd,app) and maximal activation by Cl− (Vsat) are summarized in Table II. Cl−-binding affinities (1/Kd,app) were dependent on the nature of substrate P1′ and P2′ residues: P2′-Arg > P2′-Lys > P2′-Gly in substrates with a P1′-Ala, and P1′-Ala > P1′-Phe ∼ P1′-His in substrates with a P2′-Arg or -Lys. Effects of P1′ and P2′ residues onVsat were less prominent (>2.5-fold) and could not be segregated on the basis of the substrate C-terminal structure. However, in the absence of Cl−, hydrolytic activity (V[-Cl−]) of the C-domain as a percentage of Vsat was ∼5-fold higher when the P2′ residue was Arg, compared with when it was either Lys or Ala (Table II). At saturating Cl− concentration levels (5-fold higher than Kd,app),Km values were 3.7- and 1.6-fold lower with P2′-Arg and -Lys, respectively, compared with P2′-Ala.Table IIEffect of NaCl on the activity of the ACE C-domain towards various tetrapeptide substratesSubstrateKd,app2-aSubstrate concentration used for these experiments was <Km and thus, for each substrate, variations in enzyme activities associated with changes in NaCl concentration reflect changes inkcat/Km .KmVsat2-aSubstrate concentration used for these experiments was <Km and thus, for each substrate, variations in enzyme activities associated with changes in NaCl concentration reflect changes inkcat/Km .V[−Cl−]2-aSubstrate concentration used for these experiments was <Km and thus, for each substrate, variations in enzyme activities associated with changes in NaCl concentration reflect changes inkcat/Km .mmμmpmol AcAF formed/min/ng enzyme% of VsatAcAFAR1.6452324AcAFFR3.445219.4AcAFHR5.01451313AcAFAK8.7104174.3AcAFHK20500122.0AcAFHL30200193.7AcAFFK37140172.2AcAFAG40166285.8AcAFGG731,000201.3The kinetic constants were determined in 50 mm HEPES buffer, pH 7.5, containing 10 μm ZnSO4, NaCl (0 to 100 mm) and 30 μm substratea at 37 °C, Kd,app and Vsatfor Cl−-dependent activation of the C-domain (from data in Fig. 4) and Km values for substrate hydrolysis at saturating Cl− concentration levels (>5-fold higher than Kd,app) were determined by nonlinear regression.V[−Cl−] was the enzyme activity in the absence of Cl−.

Values are the means of two independent determinations. Hydrolysis of tetrapeptide substrates by R1098Q was unaffected by Cl− (Fig. 5). For these substrates the rate of hydrolysis was equal to or lower than that seen with the wild-type C-domain in the absence of Cl− (Fig. 5). Because of the low activity of R1098Q toward the tetrapeptide substrates it was not possible to determine their kinetic constants accurately. Novel aspects of this study include the findings: 1) that a single conserved Arg in the ACE C-domain, Arg1098, is critical for the Cl−-enzyme interaction that leads to enzyme activation whereas the critical residue was previously thought to be a Lys; 2) that Cl− activates the C-domain by disrupting an intramolecular interaction involving Arg1098 that keeps the enzyme in a low affinity state with respect to Ang I binding; and 3) that Cl− binding to the enzyme is influenced by multiple determinants in a substrate, on both sides of the scissile bond. These findings suggest an interaction between the anion and the substrate in addition to the anion-enzyme interaction. Surprisingly, however, anion-substrate interactions appear to be important only for the hydrolysis of short tetrapeptide substrates and not for the decapeptide Ang I. These observations provide new insights into the molecular mechanism of ACE activation as well as the selective retention of the Cl−-binding site during ACE evolution. At the beginni"

Like other chemokine receptors, CX3CR1 is coupled to a pertussis toxin-sensitive heterotrimeric Gi protein, which is necessary for rapid rise in the concentration of intracellular calcium. Using a Chinese hamster ovary cell line stably transfected with the CX3CR1 receptor, we show that the source of calcium mobilized by fractalkine stimulation is the extracellular pool. Calcium influx is blocked by extracellular calcium chelators, as well as by divalent heavy metals such as Ni2+, Co2+, and Cd2+ without affecting the integrity of intracellular stores. Remarkably, selective phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) inhibitors, wortmannin and LY294002, abolish the wave extracellular calcium, suggesting that an active PI3K is necessary for this event. The influx of extracellular calcium is in turn required to trigger the activation of the p42/44 mitogen-activated protein/extracellular signal-regulated kinase pathway, but is not necessary for other signals downstream to PI3K, such as phosphorylation of Akt.

Fractalkine is different from typical chemokines because of its molecular size and membrane-associated structure. The fractalkine molecule consists of a 373-amino acid polypeptide chain, which carries the 76-amino acid chemokine domain at the N terminus followed by a mucin-like stalk and a transmembrane domain (3Pan Y.

The physiological roles of fractalkine are only beginning to be understood. Fractalkine plays a central role in the trafficking of leukocytes in tissues with high blood flow, like the glomerular circuit (6Chen S. Bacon K.B. Li L. Garcia G.E. Xia Y. Lo D. Thompson D.A.

However, fractalkine can also act as a typical chemokine in cell culture assays and in vivo since soluble forms of fractalkine are able to induce the migration of different types of T and natural killer cells through endothelial cells (3Pan Y.

A recent study showed that fractalkine is cleaved from membranes of neurons in culture in response to an excitotoxic stimulus (11Chapman G.A. Moores K. Harrison D. Campbell C.A. Stewart B.R. Strijbos P.J. J. Neurosci. (Online). 2000; 20: RC87Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the central nervous system, neuronally derived fractalkine mediates interactions between neurons and microglia upon nerve injury and promotes neuronal cell survival (12Boehme S.A. Lio F.M.

CX3CR1, in addition to the CCR5 and CXCR4 receptors, serves as a major co-receptor (along with the CD4) involved in the entry of dual cell tropic HIV-1 strain into target cells (15Faure S. Meyer L. Costagliola D. Vaneensberghe C. Genin E. Autran B. Delfraissy J.F. McDermott D.H. Murphy P.M. Debre P. Theodorou I. Combadiere C.

In agreement with this fact, fractalkine was recently found to inhibit CX3CR1 receptor-mediated HIV-1 infection in vitro (15Faure S. Meyer L. Costagliola D. Vaneensberghe C. Genin E. Autran B. Delfraissy J.F. McDermott D.H. Murphy P.M. Debre P. Theodorou I. Combadiere C. Science. 2000; 287: 2274-2277Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). Despite its prominent role in inflammation and HIV infection, the signaling pathways triggered by CX3CR1 are poorly understood. As with other chemokine receptors, a major signaling consequence of CX3CR1 stimulation is a rapid mobilization of calcium. It is not clear, however, how this event is regulated and how elevated intracellular calcium is related to fractalkine-mediated cell migration. Recent studies have pointed at the importance of Gβγ/PI3Kγ-dependent signaling cascades in the process of neutrophil, macrophage, and lymphocyte cell migration (17Hirsch E. Katanaev V.L. Garlanda C.

However, the importance of these pathways in CX3CR1 signaling and biological functions has not been addressed. Finally, fractalkine stimulation of CX3CR1 has been shown to induce phosphorylation of p42/44 MAPK (20Maciejewski-Lenoir D. Chen S. Feng L. Maki R. Bacon K.B. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 1628-1635PubMed Google Scholar, 21Meucci O. Fatatis A. Simen A.A. Bushell T.J. Gray P.W. Miller R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14500-14505Crossref PubMed Scopus (610) Google Scholar), but the architecture of this signaling cascade has yet to be determined. In this study, we have identified a PI3K-dependent signaling cascade, which upon CX3CR1 activation modulates extracellular calcium influx and MAPK activation. Fractalkine, cadmium chloride, nickel chloride, cobalt chloride, BAPTA, EGTA, amiloride, flunarizine hydrochloride, nimodipine, nifedipine, tetraethylammonium chloride, ionomycin, and puromycin were purchased from Sigma/RBI. Pertussis toxin, wortmannin, LY294002, and thapsigargin were obtained from Calbiochem. Antibodies against the phosphorylated forms of p42 and p44 MAPK (Thr202/Tyr204), Akt (Ser473), as well as total MAPK and Akt antibodies, and MEK inhibitors PD98059 and U0126 were from Cell Signaling Technology. Anti-CX3CR1 was from Torrey Pines Biolabs. 125I-Labeled fractalkine was purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. CHO cells were transfected with a linearized vector encoding the CX3CR1 receptor generated by PCR amplification of the CX3CR1 cDNA from a human brain library. 48 h after transfection, the cells were placed under selection with puromycin (2 µg/ml). The most resistant clones were isolated and tested for receptor expression. A highly expressing clone was selected, expanded, and used in all our experiments. Stably transfected CHO-CX3CR1 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and puromycin (2 µg/ml). Jurkat cells were cultured in RPMI, supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, and stimulated with fractalkine as described below. CHO cells expressing the human CX3CR1 receptor were grown in 15-cm plates for 24 h. The cells were washed three times with warm PBS, and plasma membranes were prepared for radioligand binding assays essentially as described (22Polakiewicz R.D. Schieferl S.M. Dorner L.F. Kansra V. Comb M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12402-12406Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Binding of 125I-fractalkine (specific activity, 2200 Ci/mmol, PerkinElmer Life Sciences) was performed using 10 µg of membrane protein resuspended in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) and 5 mm MgCl2 according to previously described methods (22Polakiewicz R.D. Schieferl S.M. Dorner L.F. Kansra V. Comb M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12402-12406Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). To generate a saturation isotherm, the ligand concentration was varied from 0.2 to 1.2 nm. The reaction (90 min at 25 °C) was terminated by rapid filtration, followed by three washes with ice-cold buffer using a cell harvester. Molar excess of cold fractalkine (100 nm) was used to determine nonspecific binding. Binding data from saturation experiments were analyzed using the GraphPad Prism 2.01 program (GraphPad Software, Inc.). For Western blot experiments, cell extracts were prepared using Laemmli sample buffer and subjected to 10% SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted as described (22Polakiewicz R.D. Schieferl S.M. Dorner L.F. Kansra V. Comb M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12402-12406Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Western blot images are representative of at least three independent experiments. In a typical experiment, cells were grown in 12-well plates for 24 h prior to treatment, washed with warm PBS, and incubated in serum-free medium for 2–4 h prior to fractalkine stimulation as indicated in the figures. This treatment was sufficient for detecting phosphorylation of MAPK or Akt over background levels. Incubation with the different inhibitors was initiated 1 h (wortmannin, LY294002, cadmium chloride, nickel chloride, flunarizine, nimodipine, and nifedipine) or 15 min (BAPTA, EGTA) before treatment with fractalkine. CHO-CX3CR1 cells were washed twice with PBS containing calcium and magnesium. The cells were then resuspended in a total volume of 1 ml of PBS with or without calcium according to the experiment to which two dyes, Fluo-3AM (4 µm) and Fura Red-AM (10 µm) (Molecular Probes), were added. The cells were incubated for 60 min at 37 °C in the dark and removed for immediate analysis on a dual laser BD FACSCalibur (San Jose, CA.). Incubation with the inhibitors was carried out as follows, 1 h for U0126 (10 µm), PD98059 (20 µm), U71322 (5 µm), wortmannin (200 nm), LY294002 (25 µm), cadmium chloride (100 µm), nickel chloride (100 µm), cobalt chloride (100 µm), amiloride (100 µm), flunarizine (10 µm), nimodipine (10 µm), nifedipine (10 µm), 5 min for BAPTA (20 µm) and EGTA (5 mm), and 15 min with TTX (200 nm). TO-PRO-3 iodide (5 µm) (Molecular Probes) was added individually to all samples just before each test to discriminate between viable and non-viable cells. The cells were then challenged with 50 nm fractalkine, and the response was measured over the course of 90 s. Cells were run at event rates between 100 and 300/s. FlowJo (Treestar Inc.) was used to derive the Fluo-3/Fura Red parameter. The median value for the fluorescence intensity of the ratioed parameter was calculated and displayed over time. All calcium tracings shown in the different figures are representative of at least 3, but in many cases up to 10, independent experiments. Reverse transcription and PCR were performed to detect the α1 subunit transcripts of the T-type Ca2+ channel in CHO-CX3CR1 cells. The primers used in the PCR amplification of fragments within the 5′ coding region of the α1G, α1H, and α1I subunit are described elsewhere (23Bijlenga P. Liu J.H. Espinos E. Haenggeli C.A. Fischer-Lougheed J. Bader C.R. Bernheim L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 7627-7632Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). As a first step to examine the signaling pathways stimulated by activation of CX3CR1, we established a CHO cell line stably transfected with the human CX3CR1 receptor cDNA. We first carried out 125I-fractalkine binding to cell membrane preparations to verify CX3CR1 receptor expression.125I-Fractalkine bound in a saturable manner, and Scatchard analysis of the binding data revealed a single population of receptors with a K d of 0.25 nm and aB max of 6.3 pmol/mg protein, representing ∼250,000 receptors/cell (Fig.1a). We then tested whether these receptors were functional by determining their ability to mobilize calcium. As shown in Fig. 1 b, 50 nmfractalkine induced calcium mobilization, as determined by flow cytometry. The peak of calcium flux was recorded at 3–5 s after agonist exposure and rapidly decreased to background levels in 20–30 s. These results show that our stably transfected CHO cells express a single class of high affinity CX3CR1 receptors for fractalkine (Fig. 1), which are capable of mobilizing calcium. Because of the importance of PI3K signaling cascades in chemotaxis (17Hirsch E. Katanaev V.L. Garlanda C. Azzolino O. Pirola L. Silengo L. Sozzani S. Mantovani A. Altruda F. Wymann M.P.

Crespo P. Pellici P.G. Gutkind J.S. Wetzker R. Science. 1997; 275: 394-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (627) Google Scholar, 28Murga C. Laguinge L. Wetzker R. Cuadrado A. Gutkind J.S. J. Biol.

As indicated in Fig. 1 c, incubation of the CHO-CX3CR1 cells with fractalkine-induced p44/42 MAPK phosphorylation (upper panel) and Akt phosphorylation (lower panel), peaking at 5 min after agonist addition and rapidly decreasing to background levels 60 min after stimulation. Total MAPK protein levels were unchanged (Fig.1 c, middle panel). No calcium mobilization, MAPK, or Akt phosphorylation was detected upon exposure of untransfected CHO cells to fractalkine (data not shown). Fractalkine induces a rapid increase in [Ca2+]i (Fig. 1 b; Ref.5Imai T. Hieshima K. Haskell C. Baba M. Nagira M. Nishimura M. Kakizaki M. Takagi S. Nomiyama H. Schall T.J. Yoshie O. Cell. 1997; 91: 521-530Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1134) Google Scholar). The rise in [Ca2+]i can be accounted for by two general basic mechanisms: the release of Ca2+ from intracellular stores or the influx of Ca2+ across the plasma membrane. To examine the source of elevated [Ca2+]i upon fractalkine (50 nm) stimulation, we incubated cells in the absence of extracellular Ca2+ (Fig.2b), or preincubated for 5 min in the presence of the Ca2+ chelators BAPTA (20 µm) and EGTA (5 mm) (Fig. 2, c andd, respectively). Incubation in calcium-free medium or depletion of extracellular calcium by calcium chelators abolished the rise in [Ca2+]i (Fig. 2), even when higher concentrations of fractalkine (500 nm) were used (data not shown). Under these assay conditions, fractalkine does not provoke the release of detectable Ca2+ from intracellular stores, but we could detect the expected increase in cytosolic Ca2+ upon depletion of intracellular stores with thapsigargin in the presence or absence of extracellular calcium (Fig.2 e, and data not shown). In the presence of BAPTA and EGTA, a robust calcium signal was detected when either 5 µg/ml ionomycin or 1 µm thapsigargin, an inhibitor of endoplasmic reticulum calcium-dependent ATPase, were added to the medium (data not shown). This indicated that incubation of the cells in calcium-free medium or in the presence of calcium chelators, like BAPTA and EGTA, did not affect the integrity of the intracellular calcium stores. This result suggests that the extracellular pool is most likely the source of calcium ions mobilized upon fractalkine stimulation. To evaluate the involvement of a plasma membrane calcium channel, we used divalent cations, which are known general calcium channels antagonists. Low concentrations of NiCl2 (100 µm), CoCl2 (100 µm), and CdCl2 (100 µm) completely blocked the rise in [Ca2+]i provoked by fractalkine (Fig. 3, c, d, andg, respectively), but did not block the release of calcium from the intracellular stores due to exposure to thapsigargin (Fig. 3,d, f, and h). The phospholipase C inhibitor U73122 (5 µm) had no effect on calcium influx provoked by fractalkine (Fig. 3 b). Because fractalkine binds to CX3CR1 (Fig. 1 a) and induces Akt phosphorylation in the absence of Ca2+ (see text below and Fig. 7b), the effects of extracellular Ca2+depletion and the effects of heavy metals on Ca2+ influx are not simply due to a dependence of fractalkine receptor binding on Ca2+. Taken together these results suggest that the rise in [Ca2+]i is strictly dependent on the influx of extracellular calcium through plasma membrane channels and does not involve Ca2+ release from intracellular stores stimulated by activation of a U73122-sensitive phospholipase Cβ-mediated mechanism.Figure 3Effect of divalent cations and the phospholipase C inhibitor, U71322, on CX3CR1 receptor-mediated calcium influx. CHO-CX3CR1 cells were stimulated with fractalkine alone (a, FKN, 50 nm), or incubated with U71322 (b, 5 µm), NiCl2 (c and d, 100 µm), CoCl2 (e andf, 100 µm), and CdCl2(g and h, 100 µm) before addition (see arrowheads) of fractalkine (a–c,e, and g) or 1 µm thapsigargin (d, f, and h). Intracellular concentration of calcium is represented by the ratio of FL-1/FL-3, where FL-1 corresponds to Fluo-3 and FL-3 corresponds to Fura red.

This class of channels is most typically expressed in excitable cells. However, several reports have suggested the presence of L- and T-type channels in non-excitable cells as well, such as lymphocytes and fibroblasts (30Chen C.F. Corbley M.J. Roberts T.M. Hess P.

We used selective Ca2+ channel antagonists to examine whether L- or T-type channels mediate the influx caused by exposure to fractalkine. Two specific L-type channel blockers, nifedipine (10 µm) and nimodipine (10 µm) failed to block fractalkine-induced calcium influx (Figs.4, e and d, respectively), ruling out the involvement of an l-type channel. T-type channels are harder to characterize pharmacologically due to the lack of truly specific antagonists. However, a few compounds, among them flunarizine and amiloride, have selective inhibitory effects on T-type channels when used at low concentrations (23Bijlenga P. Liu J.H. Espinos E. Haenggeli C.A.

Fig. 4 (b and c) shows that flunarizine (10 µm) and amiloride (100 µm) effectively blocked calcium influx by fractalkine at concentrations considered selective for T-type channels (23Bijlenga P. Liu J.H. Espinos E. Haenggeli C.A. Fischer-Lougheed J. Bader C.R. Bernheim L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 7627-7632Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar, 34Tang C.M. Presser F.

Pharmacol. 1996; 296: 189-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), but they did not inhibit calcium release from the intracellular stores provoked by exposure to 1 µm thapsigargin (data not shown). Of these two compounds, amiloride can also inhibit Na+/H+ exchange systems, but higher concentrations (>1 mm) are typically required (34Tang C.M. Presser F. Morad M. Science. 1988; 240: 213-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). The calcium influx signal stimulated by fractalkine was insensitive to TTX (Fig. 5b), excluding the possibility that a TTX-sensitive Na+ channel would be admitting sufficient Ca2+ to cause an increase in [Ca2+]i. We then asked whether this non-excitable cell line would trigger calcium influx upon depolarization with 30 mm KCl. This treatment, however, failed to induce calcium influx (Fig. 5 c), suggesting the absence of functional voltage-activated channels in the CHO-CX3CR1 cell line. Activation of a potassium channel can lead to hyperpolarization and consequent influx through voltage-insensitive Ca2+ channels (36Sorin B. Goupille O. Vacher A.M. Paly J. Djiane J. Vacher P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28461-28469Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), but such mechanism cannot explain our data because triethanolamine (30 mm), an inhibitor of K+ currents had no effect of fractalkine Ca2+ influx (Fig. 5 d). Another possibility would be an initial activation of T-type channels, perhaps present in the cells at very low levels, followed by Ca2+-induced Ca2+ release from intracellular stores. This would be in agreement with the very low expression of T-type channels found in ovary tissue (37Monteil A. Chemin J. Bourinet E. Mennessier G. Lory P. Nargeot J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6090-6100Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). We thus tested the expression of three recently identified T-type calcium channels α1 subunits, namely α1G, α1H, and α1I, in our CHO-CX3CR1 cells using RT-PCR with primers specific for the 5′ of their coding regions (23Bijlenga P. Liu J.H. Espinos E. Haenggeli C.A. Fischer-Lougheed J. Bader C.R. Bernheim L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 7627-7632Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar), and using as positive control a sample from a human brain cDNA library. We did not detect expression of any of these subunits in these cell lines (data not shown). Altogether, we interpret these results to indicate the involvement of a plasma membrane calcium channel sensitive to divalent cations, as well as flunarizine and amiloride. However, despite the reported selectivity of flunarizine and amiloride at the concentrations we used, our data are inconsistent with these being voltage-activated T-type channels.Figure 5Effect of Na+ and K+channel inhibitors, and depolarization on Ca2+ influx.CHO-CX3CR1 cells were pretreated with fractalkine alone (a, 50 nm) or preincubated with TTX (b, 200 nm) or with tetraethylammonium chloride (d, 30 mm) before addition of fractalkine at the time indicated by the arrowheads.

For humans alone, the chemokine superfamily comprises over 40 members that cluster into four families (CC, CXC, C, and CX3C) according to the number and spacing of conserved cysteines (4Zlotnik A.

Chemokines mediate their effects by binding and signaling through seven-transmembrane G-protein-coupled receptors (7TMRs),1 of which 18 human receptors have been identified thus far (2Murdoch C.

The patterns of ligand-receptor recognition are complex since chemokines and chemokine receptors typically interact with multiple partners. Furthermore, a given chemokine can act as an agonist, antagonist, or inverse agonist in the context of different receptors (6Weng Y. Siciliano S.J. Waldburger K.E. Sirotina-Meisher A. Staruch M.J.

Despite the high level of promiscuity, interactions generally occur between receptors and ligands within a particular subfamily, an important exception being viral proteins that typically show broad spectrum recognition profiles (11Damon I.

However, these details remain poorly understood because structural information on the receptors is difficult to obtain, and the important features of the ligands are encrypted in remarkably conserved tertiary structures.Fractalkine/CX3CL1 and its receptor CX3CR1 are currently the only known members of the CX3C family (21Combadiere C.

Unlike other chemokines except CXCL16 (23Wilbanks A. Zondlo S.C. Murphy K. Mak S. Soler D. Langdon P. Andrew D.P. Wu L. Briskin M. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 5145-5154Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar), fractalkine is a membrane-anchored protein consisting of a chemokine module attached to the cell membrane via a mucin-like stalk, which serves as a presentation vehicle (24Fong A.M.

A soluble form, generated by protease cleavage near the membrane, has been observed in the supernatants of fractalkine cell transfectants (25Bazan J.F. Bacon K.B. Hardiman G. Wang W. Soo K. Rossi D. Greaves D.R. Zlotnik A. Schall T.J. Nature. 1997; 385: 640-644Crossref PubMed Scopus (1686) Google Scholar). This form induces chemotaxis of monocytes, T cells, and natural killer cells. No difference in binding or signaling is observed between fractalkine variants with different lengths of mucin stalk (26Harrison J.K. Fong A.M. Swain P.A. Chen S., Yu, Y.R. Salafranca M.N. Greenleaf W.B. Imai T. Patel D.D. J. Biol.

Hieshima K. Haskell C. Baba M. Nagira M. Nishimura M. Kakizaki M. Takagi S. Nomiyama H. Schall T.J. Yoshie O.

Nature. 1997; 385: 640-644Crossref PubMed Scopus (1686) Google Scholar). Fractalkine is up-regulated on the surface of activated endothelial cells and can induce firm adhesion of CX3CR1-expressing cells, independent of G-protein activation (27Haskell C.A. Cleary M.D. Charo I.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10053-10058Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). These observations suggest that fractalkine and CX3CR1 fulfill special roles in leukocyte trafficking at the endothelium. Fractalkine and CX3CR1 probably also have important homeostatic and developmental roles, given their high constitutive expression in a variety of non-hematopoietic tissues, including the brain (25Bazan J.F. Bacon K.B. Hardiman G. Wang W. Soo K. Rossi D. Greaves D.R. Zlotnik A. Schall T.J. Nature. 1997; 385: 640-644Crossref PubMed Scopus (1686) Google Scholar, 28Pan Y. Lloyd C. Zhou H. Dolich S. Deeds J.

Their functions in the central nervous system are not fully defined, but there is recent evidence that fractalkine serves as an anti-apoptotic factor promoting microglial and hippocampal neuron survival (29Boehme S.A. Lio F.M. Maciejewski-Lenoir D. Bacon K.B. Conlon P.J. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 397-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 30Meucci O. Fatatis A. Simen A.A. Miller R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 8075-8080Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). Like many other chemokine receptors, CX3CR1 can function as an human immunodeficiency virus cofactor in vitro, and fractalkine can inhibit viral entry into cells, but it is unclear whether these activities are relevant in vivo. Although it has been reported that a variant haplotype of CX3CR1 (CX3CR1-I249 M280) is associated with accelerated progression to AIDS (31Faure S. Meyer L. Costagliola D. Vaneensberghe C. Genin E. Autran B. Delfraissy J.F. McDermott D.H. Murphy P.M. Debre P. Theodorou I. Combadiere C. Science. 2000; 287: 2274-2277Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar), these data were recently called into question (32McDermott D.H. Colla J.S. Kleeberger C.A. Plankey M. Rosenberg P.S. Smith E.D. Zimmerman P.A. Combadiere C. Leitman S.F. Kaslow R.A. Goedert J.J. Berger E.A. O'Brien T.R. Murphy P.M. Science. 2000; 290: 2031Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar).We previously solved the NMR structure of fractalkine's chemokine domain and described its interaction with an N-terminal fragment of CX3CR1 (33Mizoue L.S. Bazan J.F. Johnson E.C. Handel T.M. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 1402-1414Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). In the present study, we use mutagenesis to identify residues that are important for receptor binding and signaling. Although CX3CR1 is the endogenous receptor, fractalkine also binds with subnanomolar affinity to US28, a 7TMR encoded by human cytomegalovirus (14Kledal T.N. Rosenkilde M.M. Schwartz T.W. FEBS Lett. 1998; 441: 209-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Accordingly, we examined binding of the mutants to US28 to determine whether the viral receptor recognizes the same “hotspots” on fractalkine as CX3CR1. These studies further define the structural and chemical elements necessary for fractalkine:CX3CR1 interactions and provide insight into the molecular basis of chemokine:receptor specificity. Since chemokines and their receptors have been implicated in a number of diseases (34Segerer S. Nelson P.J. Schlondorff D. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2000; 11: 152-176PubMed Google Scholar, 35Homey B.

Immunopathol. 2000; 22: 393-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 37Gerard C. Rollins B.J. Nat. Immunol. 2001; 2: 108-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (1199) Google Scholar), the results may also aid in the development of agents that block their interaction (38Proudfoot A.E. Power C.A. Wells T.N. Immunol. Rev. 2000; 177: 246-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar).DISCUSSIONOur goal is to understand the molecular details of how chemokines bind and activate their receptors. Given that chemokines have remarkably similar folds, biochemical studies are necessary to determine what features control the specific recognition of some receptors over others. Understanding how viral receptors like US28 achieve high affinity interactions with a broad spectrum of chemokines is also an important endeavor. To this end, we identified residues of fractalkine that contribute to the interaction with the host receptor CX3CR1, and with the cytomegalovirus receptor US28. Fig.8 (left) shows a GRASP model of fractalkine highlighting residues that, when mutated, had a large (>10-fold) impact on CX3CR1 binding and/or signaling (Lys-8, Lys-15, Lys-37, Arg-45, Arg-48, and Phe-50). The identification of Lys-8 and Arg-48 as important for the interaction with CX3CR1 is also consistent with a recent mutagenesis analysis of basic residues in fractalkine (26Harrison J.K. Fong A.M. Swain P.A. Chen S., Yu, Y.R. Salafranca M.N. Greenleaf W.B. Imai T. Patel D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 21632-21641Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Below, we discuss the results in more detail and compare them to what is known about other chemokine receptor systems, particularly MCP-1:CCR2.The N Terminus Contributes to Binding Affinity and Signaling SpecificityLike other chemokines, the N terminus of fractalkine is disordered in the solution structure (33Mizoue L.S. Bazan J.F. Johnson E.C. Handel T.M. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 1402-1414Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) and probably becomes ordered only upon receptor engagement. The importance of chemokine N termini in receptor activation is well established (15Crump M.P. Gong J.H. Loetscher P. Rajarathnam K. Amara A. Arenzana-Seisdedos F. Virelizier J.L. Baggiolini M. Sykes B.D. Clark-Lewis I. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6996-7007Crossref PubMed Scopus (629) Google Scholar, 18Gong J.H. Clark-Lewis I. J. Exp.

Chem. 1996; 271: 10521-10527Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar), and fractalkine is no exception, as removal of the first 8 residues abolishes function. Although the contribution of chemokine N termini to binding varies considerably, deletion of fractalkine's N terminus caused a loss in affinity of more than 2 orders of magnitude. By comparison, N-terminal deletion of MCP-1 causes only a 7-fold reduction in affinity for CCR2 (45Hemmerich S. Paavola C. Bloom A. Bhakta S. Freedman R. Grunberger D. Krstenansky J. Lee S. McCarley D. Mulkins M. Wong B. Pease J. Mizoue L. Mirzadegan T. Polsky I. Thompson K. Handel T.M. Jarnagin K.

Wong B. Jarnagin K. Handel T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33157-33165Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar), whereas short peptides derived from the N terminus of SDF-1 have sufficient affinity to bind CXCR4 and stimulate chemotaxis in the absence of the rest of the chemokine (53Elisseeva E.L. Slupsky C.M. Crump M.P. Clark-Lewis I. Sykes B.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26799-26805Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).The importance of specific residues within the N termini also varies significantly among chemokines, thereby encoding functional specificity. For fractalkine, extension of the N terminus with a Met had no effect on binding or function whereas similar extensions of MCP-1 (18Gong J.H. Clark-Lewis I. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 181: 631-640Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar) and RANTES (47Proudfoot A.E. Power C.A. Hoogewerf A.J. Montjovent M.O. Borlat F. Offord R.E. Wells T.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2599-2603Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar) produce receptor antagonists. Among the N-terminal residues, Lys-8 is particularly crucial, somewhat akin to the ELR motif of interleukin-8 (20Hebert C.A. Vitangcol R.V. Baker J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 18989-18994Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 54Clark-Lewis I. Dewald B. Loetscher M. Moser B. Baggiolini M. J. Biol.

Skelton N.J. Hebert C.A. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 9642-9648Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar), SDF-1(15), and eotaxin (55Mayer M.R. Stone M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 13911-13916Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). In contrast, the length rather than the amino acid composition of the N terminus is important for MCP-1 (45Hemmerich S. Paavola C. Bloom A. Bhakta S. Freedman R. Grunberger D. Krstenansky J. Lee S. McCarley D. Mulkins M. Wong B. Pease J. Mizoue L. Mirzadegan T. Polsky I. Thompson K. Handel T.M. Jarnagin K. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 13013-13025Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar).K15A Displays Unique Signaling CharacteristicsThe functional responses of CX3CR1 to the fractalkine variant K15A are particularly instructive from the standpoint of general issues of 7TMR signaling. In contrast to mutants that showed marked effects on both calcium and chemotaxis (ΔNT, F50A, and R48A), K15A produced a normal calcium flux and could desensitize to further stimulation, but had a greatly diminished chemotaxis response. For certain chemokines including MCP-1 (56Yen H. Zhang Y. Penfold S. Rollins B.J. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1997; 61: 529-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) and fractalkine (43Maciejewski-Lenoir D. Chen S. Feng L. Maki R. Bacon K.B. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 1628-1635PubMed Google Scholar), receptor binding has been shown to lead to mitogen-activated protein kinase activation, a critical event controlling actin polymerization and cytoskeletal reorganization, which in turn are necessary for migration. In preliminary analysis of mitogen-activated protein kinase activation stimulation, we noted no appreciable activity induced by K15A compared with WT fractalkine (data not shown), suggesting a possible cause for the impaired chemotaxis. Differential activation of pathways was observed previously with MCP-1, where the Y13A mutant was able to inhibit adenylate cyclase and stimulate calcium flux, but not chemotaxis (46Jarnagin K. Grunberger D. Mulkins M. Wong B. Hemmerich S. Paavola C. Bloom A. Bhakta S. Diehl F. Freedman R. McCarley D. Polsky I. Ping-Tsou A. Kosaka A. Handel T.M. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 16167-16177Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Based on these findings, we suggested that certain molecular features of chemokines are required for activation of some pathways but not others, and fractalkine's K15A provides additional support for this hypothesis. Interestingly, the location of Lys-15 on fractalkine's surface is similar to that of Tyr-13 on MCP-1 (Fig. 8).Phe-50 and Arg-48 Are Essential Residues That Are Spatially Removed from the N TerminusMany mutagenesis studies of chemokines have targeted the N terminus and the extended loop (the “N-loop”) following the second cysteine because of their importance for binding and particularly signaling (15Crump M.P. Gong J.H. Loetscher P. Rajarathnam K. Amara A. Arenzana-Seisdedos F. Virelizier J.L. Baggiolini M. Sykes B.D. Clark-Lewis I.

Fairbrother W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14344-14352Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Consequently, it is interesting that the two most critical residues of fractalkine, Arg-48 and Phe-50, lie outside of these regions. Like the N terminus and Lys-8, Arg-48 is essential for signaling because mutation to Ala completely eliminated calcium flux and chemotaxis, but not binding. Mutation of Arg-48 to Glu eliminated binding whereas mutation to Gln restored much of the affinity, presumably due to the size and hydrogen bonding capacity of Gln compared with Ala. Since calcium and chemotaxis are still markedly affected by R48Q, it appears that a basic charge is required for receptor activation. The significant difference between R48Q and R48E also suggest that Arg-48 interacts with an acidic region of the receptor (see below). For the mutant F50A, a 489-fold reduction in affinity was observed on transfectants and no binding could be detected on microglia. The binding and signaling of F50L was much improved over the alanine mutant; however, it was still significantly less active than the WT protein, suggesting that an aromatic side chain at this position is important. These data provide further evidence that residues critical for signaling are not confined to the N termini of chemokines but can be dispersed over the receptor-binding surface (46Jarnagin K. Grunberger D. Mulkins M. Wong B. Hemmerich S. Paavola C. Bloom A. Bhakta S. Diehl F. Freedman R. McCarley D. Polsky I. Ping-Tsou A. Kosaka A. Handel T.M.

Thus, there may be significant variability in the mechanisms involved in activation of different chemokine receptor systems.Similarities in the Recognition Surfaces That May Account for Broad Spectrum Recognition by US28US28 not only interacts with fractalkine, but also binds CC chemokines such as MCP-1 with subnanomolar affinity (14Kledal T.N. Rosenkilde M.M. Schwartz T.W. FEBS Lett. 1998; 441: 209-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Our previous mutagenesis studies identified residues important for binding of MCP-1 to CCR2, its cognate receptor (45Hemmerich S. Paavola C. Bloom A. Bhakta S. Freedman R. Grunberger D. Krstenansky J. Lee S. McCarley D. Mulkins M. Wong B. Pease J. Mizoue L. Mirzadegan T. Polsky I. Thompson K. Handel T.M. Jarnagin K.

Preliminary data on a subset of those mutants suggest that, as with fractalkine, US28 uses the same binding epitopes on MCP-1 as the host receptor (data not shown). Therefore, a comparison of the binding surfaces of fractalkine and MCP-1 may shed light on what enables the viral receptor to engage both chemokines.At low resolution, the receptor binding surfaces of fractalkine and MCP-1 have a lot in common, as they consist of a largely basic surface with one aromatic residue (Fig. 8). In contrast, the CXC chemokine interleukin-8, which does not bind US28, has a much more hydrophobic surface (45Hemmerich S. Paavola C. Bloom A. Bhakta S. Freedman R. Grunberger D. Krstenansky J. Lee S. McCarley D. Mulkins M. Wong B. Pease J. Mizoue L. Mirzadegan T. Polsky I. Thompson K. Handel T.M. Jarnagin K.

The distribution of basic residues on the tertiary structures of fractalkine and MCP-1 are also similar (Fig. 8). Furthermore, both chemokines have residues that are highly sensitive to charge swap mutations (Arg-48 in fractalkine, Arg-24 in MCP-1), suggesting that they may interact with acidic regions of their receptors. Many studies have demonstrated that the receptor N termini are important for binding chemokines (61LaRosa G.J. Thomas K.M. Kaufmann M.E. Mark R. White M. Taylor L. Gray G. Witt D. Navarro J. J. Biol.

We showed previously that a DYDY sequence in the N terminus of CCR2 was critical for binding MCP-1 (45Hemmerich S. Paavola C. Bloom A. Bhakta S. Freedman R. Grunberger D. Krstenansky J. Lee S. McCarley D. Mulkins M. Wong B. Pease J. Mizoue L. Mirzadegan T. Polsky I. Thompson K. Handel T.M. Jarnagin K.

Others have shown that this motif is tyrosine-sulfated in vivo, and the post-translational modification is important for ligand binding (66Preobrazhensky A.A. Dragan S. Kawano T.

Interestingly, CX3CR1 and US28 also contain potential tyrosine sulfation sites (EYDD and DYDD, respectively) in their N termini (67Farzan M. Mirzabekov T. Kolchinsky P. Wyatt R. Cayabyab M.

We plan to pursue these questions in future studies.Differences in the Recognition Surfaces That Contribute to SpecificityDespite the similarities in the binding epitopes, closer inspection of the structures reveals sufficient differences to account for the class-specific recognition of fractalkine by CX3CR1 and MCP-1 by CCR2. Previously, we noted that subtle structural and chemical features create different topological landscapes on the two chemokines (33Mizoue L.S. Bazan J.F. Johnson E.C. Handel T.M. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 1402-1414Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Other salient features emerge from the mutagenesis data. Lys-8 and another critical residue, Lys-15, flank fractalkine's characteristic CX3C motif (residues 9–13). In contrast, the corresponding region of MCP-1 contains an aromatic residue, Tyr-13. Tyr-13 was the single most important residue for binding and activation of CCR2, as mutation to Ala completely eliminated chemotaxis. It is also one of the most important features distinguishing MCP-1 and fractalkine, as it produces a large hydrophobic bump on MCP-1's surface that is not present in fractalkine. Like MCP-1, fractalkine's single most important residue is aromatic, Phe-50. Since it is located in a different region of fractalkine's surface relative to Tyr-13 in MCP-1, it is probably also a critical specificity determinant.In summary, we have id"

It is believed that the C-terminal Arp2/3 complex-activating domain (verprolin homology, cofilin homology, andacidic (VCA) or C-terminal region of WASP family proteins domain) of N-WASP is usually kept masked (autoinhibition) but is opened upon cooperative binding of upstream regulators such as Cdc42 and phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2).

We focused on the acidic region of N-WASP because it is thought to interact with Arp2/3 complex and may be involved in autoinhibition. Partial deletion of acidic residues from the VCA portion alone greatly reduced actin polymerization activity, demonstrating that the acidic region contributes to Arp2/3 complex-mediated actin polymerization.

Partial deletion of acidic residues did not affect actin comet size, indicating the importance of the WH1 domain in actin structure formation.

WASP family proteins share similar domain architecture, which includes a verprolin homology, cofilin homology, and acidic domain (VCA) at the C terminus, a proline-rich region in the center, and an N-terminal basic region. In addition, N-WASP and WASP have a GTPase binding domain/CRIB motif and a WASP-homology 1 (WH1) domain at the N-terminal, whereas WAVEs have a WAVE homology domain/SCAR homology domain. (1Derry J.M.

In vitro experiments with pure Arp2/3 complex and actin show that the VCA domain is sufficient for activating Arp2/3 complex, resulting in rapid de novo actin nucleation, subsequent actin polymerization, and branched actin filament formation (5Rohatgi R.

Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 385-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). The VCA domain is thought to be responsible for the constitutive activity in vitro. In this process, the verprolin homology (V) domain associates directly with actin, whereas the cofilin homology-acidic (CA) region interacts with Arp2/3 complex, forming the nucleation machinery for actin polymerization (2Miki H.

Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 3739-3744Crossref PubMed Scopus (614) Google Scholar). The C-terminal acidic region of the WASP family proteins contains a conserved tryptophan residue that is essential for strong activation of Arp2/3 complex (13Marchand J.-B. Kaiser D.A. Pollard T.D. Higgs H.N. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 76-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). The cofilin homology region has also been shown to be essential for the activation of Arp2/3 complex (13Marchand J.-B. Kaiser D.A. Pollard T.D. Higgs H.N. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 76-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). The mechanism by which full-length N-WASP associates with Arp2/3 complex is not clear. The VCA fragment of N-WASP and WASP associates not only with actin and Arp2/3 complex but also with the region of the middle of N-WASP or WASP by intra- or intermolecular interactions forming the autoinhibited structure (7Miki H. Sasaki T. Takai Y. Takenawa T. Nature. 1998; 391: 93-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (567) Google Scholar). Many laboratories report that isolated middle regions of N-WASP or WASP suppress actin polymerization induced by the VCA portion of these proteins (14Rohatgi R. Ho H.Y. Kirschner M.W. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 1299-1310Crossref PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar, 15Prehoda K.E. Scott J.A. Mullins D.R. Lim W.A. Science. 2000; 290: 801-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar, 16Higgs H.N. Pollard T.D. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 1311-1320Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar). Therefore, it has been postulated that the VCA region and the middle region associate with each other, forming the autoinhibited structure. This complex presumably prevents the correct association between Arp2/3 complex and monomeric G-actin or weakens their interaction, which subsequently inhibits the initiation of actin polymerization. The formation of the autoinhibited structure is not well understood. The VCA region is composed of three distinct segments: verprolin homology, cofilin homology, and acidic regions. The middle region also has distinct segments such as the basic region and the CRIB motif (2Miki H. Miura K. Takenawa T. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5326-5335Crossref PubMed Scopus (555) Google Scholar). In the three-dimensional structure of truncated WASP, the CRIB motif and the cofilin homology region interact to form the folded structure (17Kim A.S. Kakalis L.T. Abdul-Manan N. Liu G.A. Rosen M.K. Nature. 2000; 404: 151-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (621) Google Scholar). This structure is one of several possible associations resulting in autoinhibition of the full-length protein. Another candidate is an interaction between acidic and basic regions since opposite charges attract. In this report, we show that partial deletion of the acidic region of N-WASP leads to constitutive activation of N-WASP in vitro. This suggests that the acidic region contributes to the formation of the autoinhibited structure in addition to being essential for activating Arp2/3 complex-mediated actin polymerization. The high activity generated by the mutant containing deletions in the acidic region is due to the presence of the WH1 domain. This domain has weak affinity for Arp2/3 complex, thereby providing another means of activating the Arp2/3 complex. Various mutant N-WASPs were expressed in SF9 cells by a bac-to-bac baculovirus expression system (Life Technologies, Inc.) with either a GST tag or a His6 tag. Recombinant virus-infected Sf9 cells were lysed, clarified, and purified with glutathione-Sepharose 4B (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) or Ni-NTA agarose (Qiagen). GST fusion VCA, VCa, and VC were purified as described previously (2Miki H. Miura K. Takenawa T. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5326-5335Crossref PubMed Scopus (555) Google Scholar, 18Suetsugu S. Miki H. Takenawa T. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6516-6526Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Arp2/3 complex was purified as described (19Egile C. Loisel T.P. Laurent V. Li R. Pantaloni D. Sansonetti P.J. Carlier M.F. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 1319-1332Crossref PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar). Actin was purified from rabbit skeletal muscle, and monomeric actin (G-actin) was isolated by gel filtration on Superdex 200 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) in G buffer (2 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.2 mm CaCl2, 0.5 mmdithiothreitol, 0.2 mm ATP). Pyrene-actin assay was performed as described previously (5Rohatgi R. Ma L. Miki H. Lopez M. Kirchhausen T. Takenawa T. Kirschner M.W. Cell. 1999; 97: 221-231Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1076) Google Scholar). Final concentrations of Arp2/3 complex, G-actin, and pyrennyl-actin were 60 nm, 2 µm, and 0.2 µm, respectively. Concentrations of wild-type or mutant N-WASPs were 100 nm. Phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2)-containing vesicles were prepared as described previously (5Rohatgi R. Ma L. Miki H. Lopez M. Kirchhausen T. Takenawa T. Kirschner M.W. Cell. 1999; 97: 221-231Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1076) Google Scholar). The binding of VCA, VCa, VC, and N-VCa N-WASPs to Arp2/3 complex was monitored with a BIAcore system (BIAcore, Uppsala, Sweden). The BIAcore system was operated at 25 °C and at a constant flow of 5 µl/min running buffer containing 10 mm Na-Hepes, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 3 mm EDTA, and 0.005% Tween 20. For immobilization of the GST-tagged VCA, VCa, VC, and N-VCa N-WASPs, a GST kit for fusion capture (BIAcore) was used. The CM5 sensor chip was first coated with goat anti-GST antibody according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, anti-GST antibody was injected on the sensor surface activated byN-hydroxysuccinimide/N-ethyl-N′-(dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide reagents, and then ethanolamine was added to inactivate the unreactedN-hydroxysuccinimide groups. Then, the GST-tagged VCA, VCa, VC, or N-VCa was diluted to ∼4 µg/ml running buffer and injected over the sensor chip coated with anti-GST antibody. GST was immobilized on an identical chip for control experiments. The efficiency of the immobilization was confirmed by the increase in resonance units (RUs) to ∼1000 RUs. After washing with high salt buffer (running buffer + 1m MgCl2), Arp2/3 complex (0.12, 0.18, 0.24, 0.36, 0.48 or 0.60 µm) was loaded onto the sensor chip, and its binding to GST-tagged fragments was monitored. Specific binding was calculated by subtracting the RUs found in control samples (background binding) from RUs detected in experimental samples. To estimate the apparent association (k a) and dissociation (k d) rate constants, we used linear transformation of the biosensor curves. The primary data were analyzed using the BIA evaluation software (BIAcore, Inc.). The model assumes that the Arp2/3 complex-N-WASP fragment interaction is pseudo first order. With this assumption the binding rate equation isdR/dt =k a CR max − (k a C + k d R,where R is the signal response, R maxis maximum response level, and C is molar concentration of Arp2/3 complex. The plot of dR/dt versus R should be linear with a slope ofk obs (= k a C +kd). Titration with a series of different concentrations of Arp2/3 complex (0.12–0.60 µm) was performed to determine k a (from the slope) andk d (from the intercept) by plottingk obs (= slope of the plot ofdR/dt versus R) against Arp2/3 complex concentration. The k obs values were obtained by selecting the region that was linear with respect to the plot ofdR/dt versus R(χ2 < 2.5). Bovine brain extract was prepared as follows. Fresh bovine brain was washed and homogenized in an equal volume of 0.1 m MES, pH 6.8, 1 mm EGTA, 0.5 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, and 1 mm dithiothreitol. The lysate was first clarified by centrifugation at 12,000 × g. The supernatant was further clarified by ultracentrifugation at 150,000 × g. The resulting supernatant was stored at −80 °C. The total protein concentration was determined to be ∼20 mg/ml by Bradford assay. Actin polymerization in bovine brain extract was monitored by pyrene fluorescence. The reaction mixture was prepared by mixing 10 µl of bovine brain extract, 20 µl of the ATP-regenerating mix, 70 µl of 1 × XB, 1 µl of GST-Cdc42 (final, 125 µm), 1 µl of 10 mm GTPγS, and finally 0.4 µm of pyrene-labeled actin. The reaction mixture was preincubated for 10 min. Wild-type or mutant N-WASP was added at a final concentration of 100 nm before fluorescence was monitored. Motility assay was performed essentially as described previously (20Suetsugu S. Miki H. Yamaguchi H. Takenawa T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 282: 739-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Carboxylated polystyrene beads (Polysciences), 0.5 µm in size, were coated with His-tagged N-WASPs as described previously (21Cameron L.A. Footer M.J. van Oudenaarden A. Theriot J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci., U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4908-4913Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). Beads (2 µl) were incubated in 10 µl of protein solution containing 2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin and 1.6 mg/ml His-tagged N-WASP (45% of total protein or as otherwise indicated) for 1 h at room temperature. Then the beads were pelleted, washed, and resuspended in 30 µl of XB. For visualizing bead motility, protein-coated beads (0.5 µl) were added to 13.25 µl of motility solution consisting of 2.5 µl of bovine brain extract, 5 µl of tetramethylrhodamine iodoacetamide-labeled actin (1 mg/ml) (prepared as described previously (22Theriot J.A. Fung D.C. Methods Enzymol. 1998; 298: 114-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar)), 2.5 µl of ATP-regenerating mix with protease inhibitor mixture, 2.5 µl of 5 × XB (500 mm KCl, 0.5 mm CaCl2, 10 mm MgCl2, 25 mm EGTA, 50 mm K-Hepes, pH 7.7), 0.25 µl of 10 mmGTPγS, and 0.5 µl of 13 µm GST-Cdc42. The mix was allowed to incubate on ice for 1 h. A 0.5-µl sample was removed and squashed between a microscope slide and an 11 mm × 22 mm-glass coverslip, sealed with vaseline, and incubated at room temperature for 1 h in the dark before observation under a fluorescent microscope. To elucidate the regions responsible for Arp2/3 complex activation and formation of the autoinhibited structure, we made several C-terminal deletion mutants, as shown in Fig. 1. The N-VCa (Δa) mutant has an intact cofilin homology region (2Miki H. Miura K. Takenawa T. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5326-5335Crossref PubMed Scopus (555) Google Scholar) but lacks most of the acidic region. The N-VCa (Δa) mutant contains only three acidic amino acids at the C terminus. The N-VC (ΔA) mutant lacks all C-terminal acidic residues. We measured the ability of these mutants to activate Arp2/3 complex-mediated actin polymerization using a pyrene actin assay. The N-VCa (Δa) mutant was able to induce actin polymerization as well as was the VCA region or the activated wild-type N-WASP (Fig.2). In contrast to wild-type N-WASP, initiation of polymerization did not require activators such as Cdc42 and PIP2 (Fig. 2 B). Therefore, an association with C-terminal acidic residues is another possible way, like the proposed CRIB motif-cofilin homology interaction, to create the autoinhibited structure (17Kim A.S. Kakalis L.T. Abdul-Manan N. Liu G.A. Rosen M.K. Nature. 2000; 404: 151-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (621) Google Scholar). We next examined the mutant that lacks the acidic region ((N-VC (ΔA)). This mutant is unable to induce or activate Arp2/3 complex-mediated actin polymerization, suggesting that acidic residues are essential for this process (Fig. 2). Our data show that the cofilin homology region, which contains three acidic amino acids (2Miki H. Miura K. Takenawa T. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5326-5335Crossref PubMed Scopus (555) Google Scholar), is essential for activating Arp2/3 complex in full-length N-WASP, whereas acidic residues at the C terminus are responsible for autoinhibition of N-WASP. To examine whether the cofilin homology region in combination with the verprolin homology region is sufficient to initiate Arp2/3 complex-mediated actin polymerization, we created the VCa mutant. This mutant contains the verprolin and cofilin homology regions, but like the N-VCa mutant, most of acidic region of the VCA fragment is deleted (Fig. 1). Although the VCa mutant was able to activate Arp2/3 complex, its activity was very weak compared with that of the N-VCa mutant. Complete deletion of the acidic region from the VCA fragment (VC mutant) resulted in complete loss of activity as reported previously (5Rohatgi R. Ma L. Miki H. Lopez M. Kirchhausen T. Takenawa T. Kirschner M.W. Cell. 1999; 97: 221-231Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1076) Google Scholar). The data show that the acidic residues in the cofilin homology region are required for activation of the Arp2/3 complex but are not sufficient (Fig. 3). We next determined which region of N-WASP is responsible for the high activity of the N-VCa mutant. A mutant containing the VCa region and proline-rich region (pro-VCa) showed weak activation for the Arp2/3 complex, similar to the VCa mutant. A mutant including the VCa region plus the IQ motif, the basic region, the CRIB motif and the proline-rich region (IQ-VCa) also showed activity similar to that of the VCa mutant. Therefore, WH1 domain appears to be responsible for potentiating Arp2/3 complex activation (Fig. 3 A). The association between Arp2/3 complex and WH1 domain alone was seen in a pull down assay with GST fusion proteins (Fig. 3 B), although the association was very weak compared with the interaction between Arp2/3 and VCA. We also detected an association between Arp2/3 complex and the region between the IQ and CRIB motifs as reported previously (15Prehoda K.E. Scott J.A. Mullins D.R. Lim W.A. Science. 2000; 290: 801-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar). However, this binding did not increase actin polymerization (Fig.3). No association between the Arp2/3 complex and the proline-rich region was observed (data not shown). These findings suggest that the WH1 domain is responsible for achieving the greater activation of Arp2/3 complex by the N-VCa mutant, presumably by stabilizing the Arp2/3 complex-N-WASP interaction in its correct orientation. In the assays described above, the acidic residues and WH1 domain are shown to be involved in activating Arp2/3 complex-mediated actin polymerization. To understand the Arp2/3 complex-N-WASP interaction in detail, we used surface plasmon resonance measurements to directly observe the association and dissociation of the Arp2/3 complex. The surface of the sensor tip was coated with protein fragments such as VCA, VC, VCa, and N-VCa N-WASPs. Then, Arp2/3 complex was injected onto the surface of the sensor tip to monitor the association between Arp2/3 and the immobilized N-WASP fragment followed by the washing out with the running buffer for monitoring the dissociation. To estimate the association of N-WASP fragments and Arp2/3, the values measured were correlated with subtracting background signals (Fig. 4A). The apparent k a and k d values were determined from linear regression analysis (by plottingk obs (slope of the plot ofdR/dt versus R during the association phase) against Arp2/3 concentration) (see “Experimental Procedures”). For the VCA fragment, k a andk d values are 1.2 × 104m−1 s−1 and 2.7 × 10−4 s−1, respectively (Fig. 4 B). This gives an equilibrium dissociation constant (K D= k d/k a) of 23 nm. This value is roughly correlated with but is smaller than that reported previously, which gives the value of ∼10−7m(13Marchand J.-B. Kaiser D.A. Pollard T.D. Higgs H.N. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 76-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar, 19Egile C. Loisel T.P. Laurent V. Li R. Pantaloni D. Sansonetti P.J. Carlier M.F. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 1319-1332Crossref PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar). This difference is probably from the different methods used (the plot of polymerization rate versus Arp2/3 concentration, thermodynamic analysis between labeled VCA and Arp2/3, and surface plasmon resonance measurement). Association between VC fragment and Arp2/3 was very weak; withk a, k d, and K Dvalues are 7.0 × 102m−1s−1, 1.2 × 10−2 s−1, and 17 mm, respectively (Fig. 4). With the VCa mutant, the graph clearly shows some affinity for Arp2/3 complex; withk a, k d, and K Dvalues are 3.0 × 103m−1s−1, 8.2 × 10−3 s−1, and 2.7 mm, respectively (Fig. 4). This difference inK D values between VC and VCa suggests that acidic residues contribute to the association between Arp2/3 complex and N-WASP (Fig. 3). For the N-VCa mutant, the association rate was greater than and the dissociation rate was less than those seen with the VCa mutant (k a and k dvalues are 5.8 × 103m−1s−1 and 3.4 × 10−3 s−1, respectively). This result indicates that the WH1 domain strengthens the binding of the Arp2/3 complex to the cofilin-homology region (Fig.4, A and B). The K D for the N-VCa mutant was about 590 nm, a value ∼10 times lower than that of the VCa mutant and ∼10 times higher than that of the VCA fragment. The difference in the K D values of N-VCa and VCa mutants against Arp2/3 complex indicates that WH1 domain should provide the binding energy of ∼1 kcal/mol, which corresponds to about a 10-fold difference of the K D values. In the pull-down assay, we detected a strong association only between Arp2/3 complex and VCA. In the case of the N-VCa mutant, the association was very weak (Fig. 4 C), presumably due to the rapid dissociation of Arp2/3 from N-VCa (k d 3.4 × 10−3 s−1) than from VCA (k d 2.7 × 10−4 s−1). Both VCa and VC mutants lacked affinity for Arp2/3 complex in the pull-down assay. These findings suggest that the dissociation of Arp2/3 complex from protein fragments missing the acidic region is very rapid. Therefore, acidic residues, which include conserved tryptophan, are presumably essential for retaining the Arp2/3 complex on N-WASP. Because VCa, which does not contain WH1, did not associate with Arp2/3 complex, but N-VCa mutant, which contains WH1, does associate with Arp2/3 in pull down assay, WH1 domain certainly contributes to the association with Arp2/3 complex. It should be noted that the N-VCa mutant and the VCA fragment were similar in their abilities to activate Arp2/3 complex despite a 10-fold difference in the affinities for the Arp2/3 complex (Figs. 2 and 4). This observation corroborates a previous report that the chimeric VCA fragment of N-WASP and WAVE1 were able to activate the Arp2/3 complex to the same extent as the VCA fragment of N-WASP although they possess different affinities for the Arp2/3 complex (23Yamaguchi H. Miki H. Suetsugu S. Ma L. Kirschner M.W. Takenawa T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 12631-12636Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). In the actin polymerization assay performed with 60 nmArp2/3 complex and 100 nm N-WASP mutant (Fig. 2), the concentration of Arp2/3 complex associated with N-VCa or VCA is 8 nm or 43 nm, respectively, from theK D values in Fig. 4. However the N-VCa mutant and the VCA mutant showed similar abilities to induce actin polymerization (Fig. 2). This result might be explained by the difference in the state of Arp2/3 complex activation. One possibility is that the Arp2/3 complex associated with the N-VCa mutant has higher affinity for G-actin than the Arp2/3 complex associated with VCA due to additional association of N-WASP with the Arp2/3 through the WH1 domain. Association through two interfaces, the WH1 domain and the VCA portion, might change the conformation of the Arp2/3 complex or the orientation between the Arp2/3 complex and N-WASP into that for higher affinity against G-actin, which might result in the high activity for inducing actin polymerization. We investigated the contribution of the WH1 domain in actin polymerization and actin comet formation in the presence of an intact VCA portion. First, we tested the ability of the IQ-VCA (ΔWH1) mutant of N-WASP to induce actin polymerization in a purified system and in bovine brain cytosol extract (Fig.5). The purified system contained only pure actin and Arp2/3 complex. When the IQ-VCA (ΔWH1) mutant of N-WASP was added along with Cdc42 and PIP2 activators, it induced actin polymerization as reported previously (14Rohatgi R. Ho H.Y. Kirschner M.W. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 1299-1310Crossref PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar). The rate of actin polymerization with wild-type N-WASP is faster than that of IQ-VCA (ΔWH1) mutant of N-WASP regardless of whether Cdc42 and PIP2 were included. The WH1 domain seems to enhance activation of Arp2/3 complex-mediated actin polymerization in proteins with an intact acidic region as well as in mutants with deletions in the acidic region (Fig.5 A). In bovine brain cytosol stimulated with Cdc42, actin polymerization with the IQ-VCA (ΔWH1) mutant of N-WASP was weaker than that of wild-type N-WASP in both the rate and the amount of polymerization (Fig. 5 B). Previous reports of actin polymerization by a ΔWH1 mutant in Xenopus extract also showed an instability in polymerized actin compared with that of wild type (14Rohatgi R. Ho H.Y. Kirschner M.W. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 1299-1310Crossref PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar). The N-VCa mutant, which has a WH1 domain but lacks part of the acidic region, induced actin polymerization at a level similar to that induced by wild-type N-WASP. These results show that the WH1 domain contributes to the polymerization in bovine brain cytosol, possibly via interaction with the Arp2/3 complex. We next examined the effect of the WH1 domain in actin comet formation, which is a model system for actin cytoskeletal structure formation. When exposed to cytosol, N-WASP-coated microspheres are able to form actin comets as WASP-coated beads (20Suetsugu S. Miki H. Yamaguchi H. Takenawa T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 282: 739-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 24Yarar D. To W. Abo A. Welch M.D. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 555-558Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). In this system, N-VCa (Δa)-coated beads formed actin comets comparable with those of wild-type N-WASP. Comets generated from beads coated with the IQ-VCA (ΔWH1) mutant were apparently smaller than those from wild-type or N-VCa (Δa) N-WASP-coated beads (Fig. 5, C andD). Therefore, actin comet formation appears to require the WH1 domain. Collectively, the WH1 domain contributes to efficient actin polymerization as well as to actin comet formation in cytosolic extract, possibly by interacting with Arp2/3 complex. In addition to the Arp2/3 complex, the WH1 domain is able to associate with WASP-interacting protein (WIP) and PIP2 (2Miki H. Miura K. Takenawa T. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5326-5335Crossref PubMed Scopus (555) Google Scholar, 25Ramesh N. Anton I.M. Hartwig J.H. Geha R.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 441-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). We do not know whether PIP2 and WIP contribute to actin comet formation. However, WIP seems to act as a scaffold for the assembly of actin comet-forming machinery such as N-WASP (26Moreau V. Frischknecht F. Reckmann I. Vincentelli R. Rabut G. Stewart D. Way M. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 441-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). The significance of WH1 binding to PIP2 is unclear (2Miki H. Miura K. Takenawa T. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5326-5335Crossref PubMed Scopus (555) Google Scholar) because deletion of the WH1 domain does not prevent PIP2-aided activation (Fig.5 A) (14Rohatgi R. Ho H.Y. Kirschner M.W. J.

N-WASP-driven actin comet formation is able to be reconstituted without WIP or PIP2 or other factors with speed comparable with that in cytosolic extracts (27Loisel T.P. Boujemaa R. Pantaloni D. Carlier M.F. Nature. 1999; 401: 613-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (805) Google Scholar). From these findings, we conclude that an association between Arp2/3 complex and the WH1 domain is important for actin comet formation."

Prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), produced by the endothelium and by SMCs themselves, acts as a potent SMC growth inhibitor. The growth-inhibitory effects of PGE2 are mediated through activation of G-protein-coupled membrane receptors, activation of adenylyl cyclases (ACs), formation of cAMP, and subsequent inhibition of mitogenic signal transduction pathways in SMCs. Of the 10 different mammalian AC isoforms known today, seven isoforms (AC2–7 and AC9) are expressed in SMCs from various species. We show that, despite the presence of several different AC isoforms, the principal AC isoform activated by PGE2 in human arterial SMCs is a calmodulin kinase II-inhibited AC with characteristics similar to those of AC3. AC3 is expressed in isolated human arterial SMCs and in intact aorta. We further show that arterial SMCs isolated from AC3-deficient mice are resistant to PGE2-induced growth inhibition. In summary, AC3 is the principal AC isoform activated by PGE2 in arterial SMCs, and AC3 mediates the growth-inhibitory effects of PGE2.

To date, at least 10 different isoforms of ACs (AC1 through AC10) have been cloned and identified in a wide array of vertebrate tissues. Most tissues express several AC isoforms, which exhibit remarkable diversities in their sensitivities toward signaling molecules such as different subunits of G-proteins, calcium/calmodulin, protein kinases, and phosphatases (4Hurley J.H.

The expression of AC isoforms in mammalian tissues is also diverse. Some isoforms exhibit extremely broad patterns of expression, such as AC2 and AC9, whereas expression of other isoforms appears to be tissue-specific, such as the neurospecific expression of AC1 (22Xia Z. Choi E.J. Wang F. Blazynski C. Storm D.R. J. Neurochem. 1993; 60: 305-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Although AC3 was originally thought to be expressed only by the olfactory neuroepithelium, it is now known to be expressed in multiple tissues (23Xia Z. Choi E.-J. Wang F. Storm D.R. Neurosci. Lett. 1992; 144: 169-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Clearly, the expression of multiple AC isoforms in a cell provides an intricate system for cross-talk and fine tuning of signals increasing cAMP formation. We show here that normal human and murine arterial SMCs express AC3 and that the principal AC isoform activated by PGE2 in these cells is a calcium-inhibited AC with pharmacological characteristics of AC3. Furthermore, arterial SMCs isolated from AC3-deficient mice are resistant to PGE2-mediated growth inhibition. Thus, AC3 mediates the growth-inhibitory effects of PGE2 in arterial SMCs. PGE2, 8-bromo-cAMP, 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (IBMX), and forskolin were obtained from Biomol (Plymouth Meeting, PA) and were dissolved in ethanol, distilled water, and Me2SO, respectively. The calcium ionophoreA23187 was from Calbiochem-Novabiochem Corp. Human recombinant platelet-derived growth factor-BB (PDGF-BB) and a polyclonal anti-Gsα antibody generated against the peptide RMHLRQYELL of bovine Gsα were from Upstate Biotechnology (Lake Placid, NY). Anti-AC3 antibodies were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA), and a monoclonal anti-CaM KII antibody was from Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY). [2,8-3H]Adenine (20–40 Ci/mmol) was obtained from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. High glucose DMEM and calcium-free DMEM were from Life Technologies, Inc. The AC3 gene has recently been disrupted in mice in the laboratory of D. R. Storm (24Wong S.T. Trinh K. Hacker B. Chan G.C.K. Lowe G. Gaggar A. Xia Z. Gold G.H. Storm D.R.

A colony of AC3+/− mice on a C57/BL6 × 129 (50:50) background was maintained and used to generate age- and sex-matched wild-type (AC3+/+), AC3+/−, and AC3−/− mice for this study. Disruption of the AC3 locus in AC3+/− and AC3−/− mice and SMCs was confirmed by polymerase chain reaction analysis of tail biopsies or cultured arterial SMCs. The two primers (5′-CTGGTGAAGTGGCTTGACCT-3′) and (5′-GTTATGAAGAAGGAGAAGACA-3′) that hybridize to sequences within the deleted region of the AC3 locus were used to identify the presence of the wild-type allele. The mutant allele was revealed by a forward primer (5′-CCTGTGCTCTAGTAGCTTTACGG-3′) that hybridizes to the reverse complement of the 5′ region of the neomycin cassette and a second primer (5′-CTGTGAAGTAGGTTCCTACCTG-3′) that hybridizes 230 base pairs downstream of the forward primer as described by Wong et al.

Human fetal aortas were obtained from the Central Laboratory for Human Embryology at the University of Washington. Eleven aortas with a gestational age of 74–145 days (mean value of 102 days) were obtained. A segment of each aorta was fixed in methyl Carnoy's fixative for immunohistochemical detection of AC3. Human newborn (2-day-old to 3-month-old) thoracic aortas were obtained from infants following accidental death, death from sudden infant death syndrome, or death from congenital defects. Human SMCs were isolated by the explant method and cultured and characterized as described previously (25Ross R. Kariya B. Bohr D.F. Somlyo A.P. Sparks V. Handbook of Physiology—The Cardiovascular System. American Physiological Society, Bethesda, MD1980: 69-91Google Scholar). All experiments were performed in DMEM with 1% human plasma-derived serum (PDS). Mouse SMCs were isolated from the thoracic aorta of wild-type (AC3+/+), AC3+/−, and AC3−/− mice. The mice were killed by carbon dioxide, and the thoracic aorta was immediately dissected and cleaned from extraneous tissue, blood, and fat. The aorta was then transferred to a 35-mm dish with 4 ml of enzyme solution (2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 1 mg/ml collagenase type 1 (Worthington Biochemical Corp., Lakewood, NJ), 0.375 mg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor (Worthington Biochemical Corp.), and 0.125 mg/ml elastase type III (Sigma) in DMEM for 30 min at 37 °C. Incubation of the aorta in this medium allows separation of the smooth muscle layer and the adventitia and removes endothelial cells. The adventitia was carefully separated from the smooth muscle layer using watchmaker forceps, and the smooth muscle layer was then minced and incubated in the above medium for 2 h at 37 °C on a shaker. After incubation, the cells were centrifuged, washed with DMEM, 10% fetal bovine serum, and plated onto 25-cm2 tissue culture flasks. Cells were characterized as SMCs by morphologic criteria and by expression of smooth muscle α-actin. One animal was used to generate one SMC strain, and the SMCs were used between passages 2 and 6. AC activity was measured in intact cells as described previously (20Wayman G.A. Impey S. Storm D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21480-21486Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). In short, human and mouse SMCs in six-well plates (150,000 cells/well) were incubated in DMEM and 1% human PDS for 2 days. The cells were labeled with [2,8-3H]adenine (2 μCi/ml) for 18 h and then preincubated with 1 mm IBMX for 30 min to inhibit cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterases (PDEs) that hydrolyze cAMP. Following stimulation of the cells with PGE2, forskolin, A23187, and KN-62 for the indicated periods of time, cellular proteins were precipitated with ice-cold 5% trichloroacetic acid containing 1 μm cAMP. [3H]cAMP was isolated by a sequential Dowex-alumina chromatography method (26Salomon Y. Londos C. Rodbell M. Anal. Biochem. 1974; 58: 541-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (3374) Google Scholar). AC activity was calculated as the percentage of [3H]cAMP formed of the total [3H]ATP + [3H]ADP + [3H]AMP pool, and the results are expressed as the ratio (cAMP/ATP + ADP + AMP) × 100 (mean ± S.E. of triplicate samples). For detection of AC3 protein in human and mouse SMCs, the cells were plated onto 100-mm dishes and maintained until the cultures were nearly confluent. The SMCs were then incubated in DMEM containing 1% PDS for 2 days. For immunoprecipitation of AC3, SMCs were harvested in 1 ml of 4 °C immunoprecipitation buffer (150 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% SDS, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm dithiothreitol), sheared with a 23-gauge needle, and centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. Supernatants were subjected to immunoprecipitation with 2 μg of anti-AC3 rabbit polyclonal antibody plus 20 μl of protein A-agarose (Pierce) at 4 °C overnight on a rotator. As a control, a 10× excess (by weight) of antigen peptide (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was included in the immunoprecipitation. Immunoprecipitates were washed three times with immunoprecipitation buffer, 10 μl of 5× SDS sample buffer was added, and samples were heated at 95 °C for 5 min. Samples were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis according to Laemmli (27Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar) on 7.5% polyacrylamide gels, transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Bio-Rad), and Western blotted with 0.1 μg/ml anti-AC3 followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Life Technologies, Inc.). For Western blot analysis of AC3 in membrane fractions, the cells were cultured as described above and harvested by scraping in a buffer containing 50 mmHEPES (pH 7.4), 50 mm NaCl, 1 mmMgCl2, 2 mm EDTA, 10 mmpyrophosphate, 10 mm NaF, 500 μmNa3VO4, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm benzamidine, 1 mm leupeptin, 1 mm pepstatin, and 1 mm aprotinin. The samples were sheared with a 23-gauge needle and centrifuged for 10 min at 10,000 × g at 4 °C in a microcentrifuge. The supernatant was then centrifuged for 60 min at 100,000 ×g at 4 °C, which resulted in a pellet rich in plasma membranes and a soluble fraction. The pellets were resuspended in the buffer above with the addition of 1% Triton X-100. Protein concentrations in the pellet fractions were quantitated by either the BCA® protein assay (Pierce) or the Bio-Rad protein assay according to Bradford (Bio-Rad). Western blots were developed by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) according to the manufacturer's instructions (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Enhanced chemiluminescence films were digitized using a scanner, and images were processed using Photoshop 5.0 and Powerpoint. Expression of AC3 in human fetal aorta was studied by using immunohistochemistry. Tissues were fixed in methyl Carnoy's fixative, embedded in paraffin, and cut into 5-μm sections. Tissue sections were deparaffinized, hydrated, and subjected to ABC immunohistochemistry (ABC Elite kit, Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) using 1 μg/ml anti-AC3. A 20-fold molar excess of peptide antigen was included as a negative control. The reaction was carried out using nickel-enhanced diaminobenzidine (Fast DAB, Sigma) and terminated with distilled water. Sections were counterstained with methyl green, dehydrated, cleared in xylene, and mounted with Permount (Fisher Scientific). Microscopy was carried out using a Sony DK5000 3CCD digital camera coupled to a Nikon Eclipse E800 microscope. Images were acquired via Photoshop. Omission of the primary antibody resulted in no staining, and the specific staining was abolished by preincubation with the peptide antigen. For measurement of DNA synthesis, SMCs (50,000 cells/well) were plated in 24-well trays and grown in DMEM, 10% fetal bovine serum. The medium was changed to DMEM, 1% PDS for 2 days when the cell cultures were nearly confluent. The cells were then stimulated as indicated in the presence or absence of 1 nm PDGF-BB for 18 h and subsequently pulsed with [3H]thymidine (1 μCi/ml) during an additional 2-h incubation as described previously (28Suzuki L. Poot M. Gerrity R.G. Bornfeldt K.E. Diabetes. 2001; 50: 851-860Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). The radioactivity incorporated into DNA was normalized to the amount of cellular protein. Cell proliferation was also measured by determining cell number. Cells (30,000 or 50,000 cells/well) were incubated in the presence of the indicated agents for 4 or 6 days. The cells were trypsinized, fixed in Holley's fixative (3.7% formaldehyde, 86 mm NaCl, 106 mm Na2SO4), and counted using a cell counter (Coulter Corp., Hialeah, FL). To investigate the characteristics of the AC isoform(s) activated by PGE2in SMCs, normal human aortic SMCs were stimulated with 2 μm PGE2. Forskolin, which activates all known AC isoforms except AC9, was used as a control. PGE2-induced stimulation of AC activity was observed at 1 min (80% increase over basal) and was maximal at 30 min (data not shown). Therefore, subsequent experiments were performed using a 30-min stimulation with PGE2. As shown in Fig.1 A, PGE2 induced an approximate 20-fold increase in AC activity in human SMCs. This stimulation was blocked by 65% by an increase in intracellular calcium levels induced by the calcium ionophore A23187. The results shown in Fig. 1 B demonstrate that A23187 did not inhibit PGE2-induced AC activation in the absence of extracellular calcium. An extracellular calcium concentration of 0.5–10 mm was required for the inhibitory effect of A23187 (Fig.1 B). Thus, the effect of A23187 was dependent on increases in intracellular calcium levels. The inhibition of PGE2-induced AC activation by the calcium ionophore was completely reversed by co-incubation with the CaM KII inhibitor KN-62 (Fig. 1 A). KN-62 alone had no effect on AC activity (data not shown). AC3 is the only AC isoform known to be inhibited by CaM KII, indicating that the main isoform activated by PGE2 in human SMCs is AC3. Expression of CaM KII in human SMCs was verified using Western blot analysis (data not shown). When four different experiments were summarized, the A23187- and CaM KII-sensitive AC3 component of PGE2-stimulated AC activation was 62.4 ± 3.8% (data not shown). Forskolin (50 μm), on the other hand, induced an approximate 80-fold stimulation of AC activity in these cells, and this effect was not significantly inhibited by increasing intracellular calcium levels (Fig. 1 A). This finding is consistent with results that show that several AC isoforms that are not inhibited by calcium are expressed in human SMCs. Together, the results show that AC3 is the principal AC isoform activated by PGE2 in human arterial SMCs. To investigate whether AC3 is indeed expressed in arterial SMCs, we used Western blot and immunohistochemical analyses. To verify that AC3 is expressed in human arterial SMCs in vivo, we used human fetal aortas for immunohistochemical detection of AC3 (Fig.2, A and B). These studies demonstrated a clear expression of AC3 in smooth muscle of fetal human aorta sections at gestational days 74 and 84 (data not shown) with much more labeling demonstrated at day 127 (Fig.2 A). Labeling was completely blocked by including AC3 peptide antigen in the reaction (Fig. 2 B). AC3 was also expressed in cultured human arterial SMCs as shown by immunoprecipitation and subsequent Western blot analysis. The AC3 antibody was found to precipitate a band of ∼170 kDa, corresponding to the glycosylated form of AC3 (Fig. 2 C). This band was efficiently blocked by the AC3 antigen used to generate the antibody (Fig. 2 C). Thus, AC3 is expressed in isolated human arterial SMCs in culture and in vivo. Next we took advantage of an AC3-deficient mouse that was recently developed in the laboratory of D. R. Storm (24Wong S.T. Trinh K. Hacker B. Chan G.C.K. Lowe G. Gaggar A. Xia Z. Gold G.H. Storm D.R. Neuron. 2000; 27: 487-497Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar) to investigate the role of AC3 in PGE2-induced signaling. SMCs were isolated from the thoracic aortas of wild-type (AC3+/+), heterozygous mouse (AC3+/−), and AC3 knockout (AC3−/−) mice and were characterized as SMCs by the expression of smooth muscle α-actin. Expression of AC3 in membrane fractions from these cells was studied by Western blot analysis. SMCs from wild-type mice showed two prominent bands at ∼170 and 180 kDa corresponding to glycosylated forms of AC3 (Fig. 2 D). These bands were present in the membrane fraction and were absent from the soluble fraction (data not shown). SMCs from AC3−/− mice, on the other hand, were devoid of AC3 expression (Fig.2 D). AC3+/− mice showed an ∼50% reduction of AC3 protein expression (24Wong S.T. Trinh K. Hacker B. Chan G.C.K. Lowe G. Gaggar A. Xia Z. Gold G.H. Storm D.R. Neuron. 2000; 27: 487-497Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar). To investigate if there is compensatory up-regulation of expression of Gsα in SMCs from AC3−/− mice, Western blot analyses were performed. These studies showed that the expression of Gsα was similar in SMCs from wild-type and AC3−/− mice (data not shown). As shown in Fig.3 A, PGE2 induced a 5-fold stimulation of AC activity in murine aortic SMCs. This activation was completely inhibited in the presence of A23187 and was nearly normalized by the CaM KII inhibitor KN-62, indicating that in murine aortic SMCs, like in human aortic SMCs, AC3 is the principal AC isoform activated by PGE2. Forskolin (10 μm), on the other hand, induced a stimulation of AC activity about 50-fold higher than that of PGE2 (data not shown), indicating that forskolin-sensitive AC isoforms other than AC3 were expressed by these cells. SMCs were also isolated from AC3+/− mice that retain ∼50% of the AC3 expression level found in wild-type littermates (24Wong S.T. Trinh K. Hacker B. Chan G.C.K. Lowe G. Gaggar A. Xia Z. Gold G.H. Storm D.R. Neuron. 2000; 27: 487-497Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar). We used AC3+/− animals rather than AC3−/− animals in several of our experiments because of the low number of adult AC3−/− mice available. Aortic SMCs from AC3+/− mice showed only half of the PGE2-induced AC activation found in SMCs from wild-type mice (Fig. 3 A). As in SMCs from wild-type mice, the PGE2-induced AC activity in SMCs from AC3+/− mice was completely blocked by increasing intracellular calcium concentrations and normalized by co-incubation with the CaM KII inhibitor KN-62 (Fig.3 A). We next investigated whether AC isoforms other than AC3 could be activated by high concentrations of PGE2. For these experiments, SMCs isolated from AC3+/− mice and wild-type littermates were stimulated with concentrations of PGE2 up to 50 μm (Fig. 3 B). The highest concentrations were well above receptor saturating concentrations. We showed that increasing concentrations of PGE2 could not compensate for the 50% reduction in AC activation seen in SMCs from AC3+/− mice, indicating that other AC isoforms did not efficiently couple to PGE2 receptors (EP2 and/or EP4 receptors) even at supraphysiological concentrations of PGE2 (Fig.3 B). Thus, AC3 is the principal AC isoform activated by PGE2 in murine aortic SMCs. The role of AC3 in PGE2-mediated growth inhibition of SMCs was investigated next. PGE2 (10 μm) induced an ∼40% inhibition of basal DNA synthesis and proliferation measured as cell number in human SMCs and inhibited PDGF-BB-induced proliferation to a similar extent (TableI). Although the AC activity studies showed that AC3 played a major role in PGE2-induced AC activation, the role of AC3 in growth inhibition cannot be readily studied in human SMCs. Instead we used SMCs isolated from AC3+/− mice, AC3−/− mice, and wild-type littermates to address the role of AC3 in SMC proliferation. The results in Fig.4 A show that 10 μm PGE2 caused an approximate 65% inhibition of DNA synthesis in SMCs from wild-type mice. The ability of PGE2 to suppress DNA synthesis was reduced in SMCs from AC3+/− and AC3−/− animals and only reached a 35% inhibition in both cases (Fig. 4 A). Thus, although tissues from AC3+/− mice retained about half of their AC3 expression, this expression level did not appear sufficient to efficiently mediate the growth-inhibitory effects of PGE2 receptors (Fig. 4, A andC). It is likely that a reduced expression of AC3, which is normally a protein present at low levels, results in inefficient cAMP formation and subsequent inhibition of DNA synthesis and cell replication following exposure of AC3+/− SMCs to PGE2. This concept is supported by the reduced ability of PGE2 to stimulate cAMP accumulation in AC3+/− SMCs (Fig.3).Table IPGE2 inhibits human arterial SMC proliferationDNA synthesisCell numbercpm/well(cells/well) × 1000Vehicle6,263 ± 18194 ± 2PDGF-BB11,455 ± 821149 ± 0PGE23,712 ± 18053 ± 3PGE2 + PDGF-BB7,736 ± 73374 ± 3Human SMCs were plated (50,000 cells/well) in 12-well trays.

Whereas PGE2 (10 μm) gave an approximate 70% inhibition of PDGF-BB-induced proliferation, SMCs from AC3−/− mice were completely resistant to the growth-inhibitory effects of PGE2 (Fig. 4 B).

In this study we used this model to investigate the physiological role of cPLA2 in regulation of NADPH oxidase-associated diaphorase activity. A novel diaphorase activity assay, using 4-iodonitrotetrazolium violet as an electron acceptor, was used in permeabilized neutrophils and PLB-985 cells differentiated toward the granulocytic or monocytic phenotypes. Phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, guanosine 5′-3-O- (thio)triphosphate (GTPγS), or FMLP stimulated a similar diphenylene iodonium-sensitive diaphorase activity pattern in neutrophils and in differentiated parent PLB-985 cells. This diaphorase activity was not detected in undifferentiated cells, but developed during differentiation. Furthermore, diaphorase activity could not be stimulated in permeabilized neutrophils from X-linked CGD patients and in differentiated gp91phox-targeted PLB-985 cells that lacked normal expression of gp91phox, but was restored to these cells following transduction with retrovirus encoding gp91phox. The differentiated PLB-D cells showed no diaphorase activity when stimulated by either GTPγS or FMLP, and only partial activation when stimulated with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate. Diaphorase activity in response to either agonists was fully restored by the addition of 10 μm free AA. The permeabilized cell 4-iodonitrotetrazolium violet reduction assay offers a unique tool for the evaluation of NADPH oxidase-associated diaphorase activity in stimulated whole cells.

NADPH oxidase subunits include three cytoplasmic components, p47phox, p67phox, and Rac2, and a membrane flavocytochrome b558 composed of gp91phox and p22phox (1Leto T.L. Gallin J. Snyderman R. Fearon D. Haynes B. Nathan C. Inflammation: Basic Principles and Clinical Correlates. Lippincott Williams and Wilkins, Baltimore1999: 769-786Google Scholar,2Babior B.M. Blood. 1999; 93: 1464-1476Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The flavocytochrome b558 contains three redox centers (FAD and 2 hemes) and an NADPH binding site (3Segal A.W. Abo A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1993; 18: 43-47Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar). In addition, a H+ channel was identified within the N-terminal 230 amino acids of gp91phox (2Babior B.M. Blood. 1999; 93: 1464-1476Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 4Henderson L.M. Thomas S. Banting G. Chappell J.B. Biochem. J. 1997; 325: 701-705Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). In phagocytes, stimulation results in translocation of cytosolic NADPH oxidase components to the membrane, where they interact with the flavocytochrome to form the activated oxidase. This activated enzyme transfers electrons from cytosolic NADPH to extracellular or phagosomal molecular oxygen through the electron transport chain. The flavin center transfers electrons from the physiological electron donor, NADPH, to two membrane-imbedded hemes of the cytochrome. The latter serves as the terminal electron donor to oxygen (2Babior B.M. Blood. 1999; 93: 1464-1476Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 5Cross A.R. Yarchover J.L. Curnutte J.T. J. Biol.

It has been demonstrated that the single electron transfer from internal NADPH, through the oxidase complex, to external oxygen is an electrogenic process and that the efflux of H+ through the H+ channel is necessary for charge compensation (6Nanda A.

We have previously established a model of cytosolic phospholipase A2-deficient differentiated PLB-985 cells (PLB-D cells) and demonstrated that cPLA2-generated arachidonic acid (AA) is essential for activation of NADPH oxidase through undefined mechanisms (19Dana R. Leto T. Malech H. Levy R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 441-445Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). The model of differentiated PLB-D cells offers a unique tool to study the physiological mechanism by which AA generated by cPLA2 regulates NADPH oxidase activity. In our most recent work, we have shown that cPLA2-generated AA is essential for activation of the oxidase-associated H+ channel using this model (20Lowenthal A. Levy R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21603-21608Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Although H+ channel inhibitors decreased NADPH oxidase activity, as expected from the behavior of coupled reactions, they had no effect on the metabolic acidification following oxidase activation, but inhibited only the second alkalization phase. It was concluded that the H+ channel regulates oxidase activity but is not responsible for initiation of oxidase activity. Thus, AA likely acts at other sites mediating oxidase activation. The aim of the present study was to investigate the involvement of cPLA2 and its metabolite AA in regulation of NADPH oxidase-associated diaphorase activity, using the cPLA2-deficient cell line model. In order to achieve this goal, we first adapted the INT reduction assay for measuring oxidase diaphorase activity in permeabilized neutrophils and differentiated PLB-985 cells. PLB-985 cells, selected PLB-D clones, and gp91phox-targeted PLB-985 cells, lacking the expression of normal gp91phox (21Zhen L. King A.A. Xiao Y. Chanock S.J. Orkin S.H. Dinauer M.C. Proc. Natl.

Optimal concentrations of 1.25% Me2SO were added to PLB cells or PLB-D cells (2 × 105 cells/ml) at their logarithmic growth phase to induce differentiation toward granulocyte-like cells (20Lowenthal A. Levy R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21603-21608Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Differentiation was induced for 4 days and determined by Mac-1 antigen expression detected by indirect immunofluorescence, as described previously (22Hazav P. Shany S. Moran A. Levy R. Cancer Res. 1989; 49: 72-75PubMed Google Scholar). Granulocytes from healthy subjects and from X-linked CGD patients were purified by Ficoll/Hypaque centrifugation, dextran sedimentation, and hypotonic lysis of erythrocytes (23English D. Andersen B.R. J. Immunol. Methods. 1974; 5: 249-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (578) Google Scholar). The production of superoxide anion (O2−) by intact cells was measured as the superoxide dismutase-inhibitable reduction of ferricytochrome c as described previously (19Dana R. Leto T. Malech H. Levy R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 441-445Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were suspended (5 × 105 cells/well) in 100 μl of Hanks' balanced salts solution containing 150 μm ferricytochrome c and activated by the addition of the appropriate stimulus. The reduction of ferricytochromec was followed by a change of absorbance at 550 nm every 2 min over a 20-min time course, using a Thermomax microplate reader (Molecular Devices, Menlo Park, CA). The maximal rates of superoxide generation were determined using an extinction coefficient ε550 = 21 mm−1cm−1. Cells were permeabilized according to Lu et al. (24Lu D.J. Grinstein S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 13721-13729Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), with slight modifications. Cells were counted, centrifuged and then resuspended in cold phosphate-buffered saline to a concentration of 1 × 107 cells/ml. Samples of 0.8 × 107 cells were then centrifuged and resuspended in cold electroporation buffer containing 140 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 100 nm CaCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 10 mm glucose, and 10 mm Hepes titrated to pH 7. The cells were then electroporated in a Bio-Rad Pulser cuvette with two to four discharges of 5 kV/cm2 of a 25-microfarad capacitor using a Bio-Rad Gene Pulser. Between pulses the samples were incubated for 30 s on ice. The cells were centrifuged (10 s at 6000 ×g) and instantly resuspended in the electroporation buffer with the addition of 1 mm ATP, 100 μm GTP, 2 mm NADPH, and 1 mm INT or 150 μmcytochrome c, for the immediate measurement of INT reduction or superoxide production, respectively. 60 μg/ml SOD, 0.5 μg/ml rotenone, or 6.5 μm diphenylene iodonium (DPI) were added to the sample when indicated. More than 95% of the cells were permeabilized by this method, as determined by trypan blue staining, and more than 85% were still permeabilized 15 min after electroporation. Measurement of cytochrome c or INT reduction in permeabilized cells were performed in a 96-well microtiter plate; 106 cells were plated in each well (5Cross A.R. Yarchover J.L. Curnutte J.T. J. Biol.

Inhibitors and activators were added as indicated, and the reaction was monitored for 10 min in 30-s intervals, using the kinetic microtiter plate spectrophotometer. INT reduction was followed by an increase in absorbance at 490 nm, and the maximal rates of INT reduction in nanomoles of e−/106 cells/min were determined using an extinction coefficient ε = 10.5 mm−1, cm−1, assuming INT is a two-electron acceptor. Cytochrome c reduction was followed by an increase in absorbance at 550–650 nm. Membrane and cytosol fractions were prepared as described previously (19Dana R. Leto T. Malech H. Levy R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 441-445Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Stimulated or resting permeabilized cells were centrifuged, sonicated in the presence of 5 mm EGTA, 100 mm KCl, 3 mm NaCl, 3.5 mmMgCl2, 10 mm PIPES (pH 7.4), 1 mmPMSF, and 100 μm leupeptin, and membrane and cytosol fractions were separated. Similar results were obtained in the presence or absence of preincubation with 5 μg/ml cytochalasin B (data not shown), which inhibits actin polymerization induced by GTPγS or FMLP in permeabilized neutrophils (25Mukherjee G.

Protein (150 μg) from cell membrane were separated by electrophoresis on 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and blotted to nitrocellulose. Immunoblot detection of NADPH oxidase components was performed as described previously (19Dana R. Leto T. Malech H. Levy R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 441-445Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). The relative changes of the proteins was quantitated using densitometry in a reflectance mode (Hoefer Scientific Instruments, San Francisco, CA). PLB-985 or PLB-D cells (1 × 107cells/ml) were stimulated and permeabilized. Membrane and cytosol fractions were separated as described above. PLA2 activity was determined in the cytosols, using sonicated dispersions of 1-stearoyl-2-[14C]arachidonyl phosphatidylcholine (30 μm, 50,000 dpm/assay) andsn-1,2-dioleoylglycerol (molar ratio 2:1), in an assay mixture containing 5 mm DTT as described previously (19Dana R. Leto T. Malech H. Levy R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 441-445Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Briefly, the assay mixture contained the phospholipid substrate in 80 mm KCl, 5 mm CaCl2, 5 mm DTT, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 1 mmEDTA, and 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4. The reaction was started by the addition of 50 μg of cytosolic protein (within the linear protein range of the assay) and incubated at 37 °C in a shaking water bath for 10 min. NADPH oxidase activity was restored to targeted, gp91phox-deficient PLB-985 cells (21Zhen L. King A.A. Xiao Y. Chanock S.J. Orkin S.H. Dinauer M.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Following day 3 of transduction, the cells were maintained in culture for in culture for 1 day and induced to differentiate with 1.25% Me2SO for an additional 4 days before assaying NADPH oxidase and diaphorase activities. Several studies have detected NADPH oxidase-associated diaphorase activity in a cell-free system and in membrane fractions of activated human neutrophils and PLB-985 cells using INT as a substrate (5Cross A.R.

The first set of experiments in the present study was designed in order to develop a system for detecting diaphorase activity in permeabilized whole cells, since diaphorase activity resides within the cytoplasmic surface of the membrane. The system for detection of INT reduction was based on a permeabilized cell technique detecting cytochromec reduction (24Lu D.J. Grinstein S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 13721-13729Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 31Rubinek T. Levy R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1176: 51-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The INT reduction assay was established in permeabilized human neutrophils (TableI) and then applied to permeabilized PLB-985 cells differentiated toward a granulocytic phenotype (TableII). Two stimuli were chosen to develop the assay: PMA, which is a potent activator of NADPH oxidase; and GTPγS, which can activate the oxidase only in permeabilized cells. As presented in Table I, stimulation of permeabilized human neutrophils with the optimal concentrations of PMA (50 ng/ml) or GTPγS (25 μm) resulted in linear rates of INT reduction, which were significantly higher than observed in non-activated cells (p < 0.003 or p < 0.027, respectively). The optimum INT concentration for maximum detection of diaphorase activity was found to be 1 mm (data not shown). INT reduction could not be detected in stimulated permeabilized neutrophils in the absence of NADPH (Table I), which further indicated a close association with NADPH oxidase activation.Table IINT reductase activity of activated permeabilized human neutrophilsUnstimulatedPMAGTPγSnmol e−/min/106 cells4.96 ± 1.4644.14 ± 6.7423.44 ± 6.40Without NADPH0.040.02 ± 0.00.02 ± 0.0SOD4.52 ± 0.8632.18 ± 5.9012.56 ± 6.12SOD + rotenone4.78 ± 0.6032.38 ± 1.9013.08 ± 1.04SOD + rotenone + DPI4.34 ± 1.0419.90 ± 2.564.20 ± 0.68DPI-inhibitable diaphorase activity0.44 ± 0.6612.48 ± 1.908.88 ± 1.04INT reduction in permeabilized neutrophils was detected as described under “Experimental Procedures” in the presence of 2 mm NADPH.

INT reduction in permeabilized differentiated PLB cells was detected as described under “Experimental Procedures” in the presence of 2 mm NADPH. Where indicated 60 μg/ml SOD, 0.5 μg/ml rotenone, or 6.5 μm DPI were added. In order to determine whether superoxide released by the stimulated oxidase causes any direct reduction of INT in stimulated permeabilized neutrophils, diaphorase activity was examined in the presence of SOD and compared with cytochrome c reduction. SOD was used at its optimal concentration of 60 μg/ml, which totally inhibits cytochrome c reduction in intact neutrophils (data not shown). Addition of SOD caused inhibition of INT reduction in permeabilized neutrophils stimulated with either PMA or GTPγS by 27.1 ± 4.72% or 40.4 ± 3.49%, respectively (Table I). SOD had no effect on INT reduction in non-activated cells (Table I). Under the same conditions, SOD inhibited 71 ± 1.89% and 55 ± 4.41% of cytochrome c reduction stimulated by PMA or GTPγS, respectively, indicating that under these conditions superoxide is not solely responsible for cytochrome creduction. Similar effects of SOD on these two activities were shown in cell-free assays (5Cross A.R. Yarchover J.L. Curnutte J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21448Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To inhibit the fraction of INT reduction caused by superoxide, SOD was added to the reaction mixture of all INT reduction assays, similar to the previous described methods for cell free system (5Cross A.R. Yarchover J.L. Curnutte J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21448Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Diebold B.A. Bokoch G.M. Nat. Immunol. 2001; 2: 211-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). To determine whether INT can be reduced by mitochondria, INT reduction was measured in the presence of the mitochondrial electron transfer chain inhibitor, rotenone. Addition of 0.5 μg/ml rotenone had no effect the rate of INT reduction measured in permeabilized neutrophils activated by PMA or GTPγS (Table I). However, to prevent any INT reduction by the mitochondrial electron transfer chain, all experiments were carried out in the presence of 0.5 μg/ml rotenone. DPI is a known potent inhibitor of NADPH oxidase (32Hancock J.T. Jones O.T. Biochem. J. 1987; 242: 103-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar, 33Cross A.R. Jones O.T. Biochem.

Recent studies show that DPI inhibits the electron transfer through the oxidase by affecting both the FAD binding center (36O'Donnell B.V. Tew D.G. Jones O.T. England P.J. Biochem. J. 1993; 290: 41-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (514) Google Scholar) and heme components of the flavocytochrome (37Doussiere J. Vignais P.V. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 175: 143-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 38Doussiere J. Vignais P.V. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 208: 61-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 39Doussiere J. Gaillard J. Vignais P.V. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 3694-3703Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Cross et al. (5Cross A.R. Yarchover J.L. Curnutte J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21448Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) reported that, in a cell-free system, NADPH oxidase-associated diaphorase activity and cytochrome c reduction could be inhibited by DPI. This inhibitor was used in stimulated permeabilized neutrophils to determine the fraction of INT reduction attributable to NADPH oxidase activity. The dose-dependent effect of DPI on INT and on cytochrome c reduction was examined in the range of 0–8 μm in stimulated permeabilized neutrophils. As shown for permeabilized neutrophils activated by GTPγS (Fig.1), maximal inhibition of either INT reduction or cytochrome c reduction was achieved in the presence of 5 μm DPI. Similar results were obtained with PMA as a stimulant (data not shown). The presence of DPI caused a significant (p < 0.05) inhibition of diaphorase activity in permeabilized neutrophils stimulated with PMA or GTPγS (Table I), whereas it had no effect on the low level of INT reduction in unstimulated cells. Representative results demonstrating the kinetics of INT reduction and its inhibition by DPI are shown in Fig.2. The fraction of DPI-inhibited INT reduction, which is insensitive to SOD, is therefore likely mediated by NADPH oxidase-associated diaphorase activity. To further support this suggestion, INT reduction was studied in neutrophils from a patient with X-linked CGD patient with gp91phoxdeficiency. As shown in Fig. 2, INT reduction in X-linked gp91phox-deficient neutrophils stimulated with PMA was identical in the absence or presence of DPI and in unstimulated cells. Stimulation with either GTPγS or FMLP revealed similar results (data not shown). Of note is that INT reduction in permeabilized neutrophils from a patient with X-linked deficient gp91phox is similar to INT reduction in unstimulated normal neutrophils and to the fraction of INT reduction that is not inhibited by DPI in normal neutrophils. These results clearly indicate that the fraction of INT reduction inhibited by DPI represents NADPH oxidase-associated diaphorase activity and, furthermore, that DPI is a specific inhibitor of this activity in this system. A scheme illustrating the topology of the flavocytochrome with regard to functional sites involved in electron transport, including sites of interactions with electron acceptors (INT) and inhibitors, is presented in Fig. 3. Representative kinetics of DPI-inhibitable INT reduction in permeabilized neutrophils from healthy donors and from an X-linked gp91phox-deficient patient stimulated by PMA, GTPγS, or the physiological agonist FMLP, and in unstimulated cells, are presented in Fig. 4. The means ± S.E. of the maximal rates of DPI-inhibitable INT reduction stimulated with PMA, GTPγS, or FMLP are 12.48 ± 1.9, 8.88 ± 1.04 or 7.12 ± 0.5 nmol of e−/106cells/min, respectively, and is negligible in unstimulated cells, 0.44 ± 0.66 nmol of e−/106 cells/min, (Fig. 4, Table I). The maximal rates of SOD-inhibitable cytochromec reduction in permeabilized neutrophils stimulated with PMA, GTPγS, or FMLP was found to be: 15.5 ± 2.5, 10.25 ± 1.5, or 7.57 ± 1.49 nmol of O2−/ 106 cells/min, respectively. Thus, the relative yields for cytochrome c and INT reduction were essentially identical in permeabilized neutrophils.Figure 2The effect of DPI on stimulated INT reduction in permeabilized normal and X-linked CGD neutrophils.

The E. coli DNA polymerase III holoenzyme, widely considered to be a prototypical replicative complex, is composed of 10 different subunits (α, ε, θ, β, τ, γ, δ, δ′, χ, and ψ). These subunits are organized into three types of functional complexes as follows: (i) a pol III1 DNA polymerase (pol III, αεθ), (ii) a processivity factor (β2 clamp), and (iii) an energy-dependent clamp loading apparatus (DnaX complex, τ2γδδ′χψ) (7Wickner S.

Both the τ and γ subunits are products of the dnaX gene; γ is a truncated version of τ arising from a −1 ribosomal frameshift (10McHenry C.S. Griep M.A. Tomasiewicz H. Bradley M. Richardson C.C.

Both DnaX proteins associate with the auxiliary subunits δδ′ and χψ to form a functional clamp loader. Chemical cross-linking was recently used to demonstrate that δ′ and ψ contact γ and not τ within the native holoenzyme (14Glover B.P. McHenry C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 3017-3020Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The auxiliary and catalytic subunits function together to confer upon the holoenzyme special properties that distinguish it from simpler polymerases not devoted to chromosome replication. In the presence of auxiliary subunits, the pol III holoenzyme is capable of forming a stable initiation complex (IC) on the primed template in a process that requires ATP hydrolysis. In the absence of auxiliary subunits, ATP is ineffective in inducing the formation of stable complex dramatically decreasing processivity (15Johanson K.O. McHenry C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 12310-12315Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). pol III (αεθ) activity is inhibited by high salt concentrations and the E. coli single-stranded DNA-binding protein (SSB) in the absence, but not the presence, of auxiliary subunits (5Mok M.

Chem. 1981; 256: 976-983Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the auxiliary subunits appear to assuage these inhibitory effects in simpler polymerase forms. The δ and δ′ subunits are key components for the assembly and function of the DnaX complex (τ3δδ′χψ, γ3δδ′χψ, τγ2δδ′χψ, or τ2γδδ′χψ) and are required for the assembly of the processivity factor β2 onto primed template (17Onrust R.

As described in this report, we developed purification procedures that yield large quantities of homogeneous δ and δ′. We have used these δ and δ′ preparations in studies that further define their roles in replication catalyzed by the DNA polymerase III holoenzyme. The requirements for δ or δ′ in DNA replication were investigatedin vitro by use of a reconstitution activity assay employing homogenous subunits, and in vivo by use of bacterial strains carrying chromosomal knockout versions of eitherholA or holB. We also developed a method to isolate an IC lacking both δ and δ′. This allowed us to explore the roles of δδ′ subsequent to formation of the IC. Evaluation of the rate and extent of DNA chain elongation revealed that δ and δ′ are involved in elongation. Recombinant δ (19Carter J.R. Franden M.A. Aebersold R. McHenry C.S. J.

Open table in a new tab δ fraction II was resuspended in 300 ml of Buffer A and dialyzed against Buffer A + 50 mmNaCl (pH 7.0). Unless otherwise stated, all dialysis procedures described in this report employed a 45-mm membrane with a molecular mass cut of 3,500 Da (Spectrum Laboratories, Inc., Rancho Dominguez, CA), and buffer was exchanged 3 times, 5 liters each, every 3 h. The dialyzed δ fraction II sample was diluted to a conductivity equivalent to Buffer A + 50 mm NaCl by adding Buffer A and then applied to a Q-Sepharose FF column (42.4 cm2 × 25 cm). The δ subunit requires DTT for maintenance of activity and tends to precipitate in low salt (<70 mm), especially during dialysis. Thus, low salt buffers were avoided except for short periods, and 5 mm DTT was included in all buffers. The column was washed with 8 liters of Buffer A + 100 mm NaCl, and proteins were eluted with a 10-liter NaCl gradient (100–200 mm) in Buffer A at a flow rate of 150 ml/h. δ was eluted at a conductivity equivalent to Buffer A + 150 mm NaCl. Fractions were pooled at one-half peak height by activity as fraction III (1.9 liters, Table I). δ in fraction III was precipitated with ammonium sulfate (60% saturation) and centrifuged at 23,000 × g for 1 h. The fraction III pellet was resuspended in 200 ml of Buffer A and dialyzed against Buffer A + 30 mm NaCl. The dialysate was clarified by centrifugation (23,000 × g for 30 min) and applied to a 350-ml SP-Sepharose HR column equilibrated with Buffer A + 30 mm NaCl at a flow rate of 100 ml/h. The column was washed with 7 liters of Buffer A + 30 mm NaCl, and proteins were eluted with a 3.8-liter NaCl gradient (30–200 mm) in Buffer A at a flow rate of 80 ml/h. δ was eluted at a conductivity equivalent to Buffer A + 100 mm NaCl. Fractions were pooled at one-half peak height by activity, as fraction IV (990 ml, TableI). δ in fraction IV was precipitated with ammonium sulfate (55% saturation) and centrifuged at 23,000 × g for 1 h. The pellet was resuspended in 33 ml of Buffer C, centrifuged at 23,000 ×g for 30 min, and then applied to a Sephacryl S-100 column (5.7 cm2 × 110 cm) equilibrated with Buffer C. The δ subunit was eluted (3.1 ml/fraction) with Buffer C at a flow rate of 36 ml/h. Activity peak fractions were combined to yield fraction V (65 ml, Table I). Purified δ (Fig. 1 A) was aliquoted, immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80 °C. E. coli strain HB101 containing pMAF205 (DMSO number 886) was used; this strain produces δ′ at levels corresponding to ∼2% of total protein (21Carter J.R. Franden M.A. Aebersold R. McHenry C.S. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 3812-3822Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Cells were suspended to 20% (w/v) in Tris/sucrose buffer. Cell lysate preparation (fraction I) and ammonium sulfate precipitation (fraction II) were performed as described for the δ subunit. δ′ fraction II was resuspended in 300 ml of Buffer E + 20 mm NaCl and dialyzed against this buffer. Care should be taken at this step to limit dialysis time to 6 h or less to avoid precipitation of δ′ activity. The sample was then diluted to a conductivity equivalent to Buffer E + 20 mm NaCl by adding Buffer E and applied to a Q-Sepharose FF column (42.4 cm2 × 25 cm). The column was washed with 7.2 liters of Buffer E + 20 mm NaCl, and proteins were eluted with an 8-liter NaCl gradient (20–200 mm) in Buffer E at a flow rate of 180 ml/h. δ′ eluted at a conductivity equivalent to Buffer E + 110 mm NaCl.

The fraction III pellet was resuspended in 300 ml of Buffer D and dialyzed against this buffer (2 changes every 2 h, 5 liters each). The dialysate was clarified by centrifugation (23,000 × g, 30 min) and applied to a 350-ml hydroxylapatite column equilibrated with Buffer D at a flow rate of 90 ml/h. The column was washed with 1.5 liters of Buffer D, and proteins were eluted with a 3-literL KPO4 gradient (10–150 mm) at a flow rate of 90 ml/h. Fractions were eluted at a conductivity equivalent to Buffer D + 60 mmKPO4 and pooled at one-half peak height by activity, as fraction IV (630 ml). The contaminating nuclease activity of the pooled fraction IV of δ′ was 33 units per 20 μg, as determined via a nuclease detection assay employing a double-stranded DNA substrate. No single-stranded DNA-specific nuclease activity was detected in δ′ fraction IV. An additional anion exchange column was used to remove the contaminating nucleases that co-eluted with δ′ in the hydroxylapatite column chromatographic step. δ′ in fraction IV was precipitated with ammonium sulfate (55% saturation) and centrifuged as before. The fraction IV pellet was resuspended in 70 ml of Buffer E + 20 mm NaCl and dialyzed against this buffer (2 changes every 2 h, 5 liters each). This fraction was then applied to a Q-Sepharose FF column (350 ml) pre-equilibrated with Buffer E + 20 mm NaCl. The column was washed stepwise with 1.8 liters of Buffer E + 20 mm NaCl followed by 2-liter Buffer E + 90 mm NaCl. Proteins were eluted at 40 ml/h with a 2-liter NaCl gradient (100–200 mm) in Buffer E. δ′ was eluted at a conductivity equivalent to Buffer E + 140 mmNaCl; the contaminating nuclease activity was successfully removed by this procedure. The eluted δ′ fractions were pooled at one-half peak height by activity as fraction V (425 ml, Table II). Contaminant nuclease activity (double-stranded DNA) in the pooled fraction V of δ′ was <4 units per 20 μg. δ′ in fraction V was precipitated with ammonium sulfate (55% saturation) and centrifuged as before. The fraction V pellet was resuspended in 25 ml of Buffer B, clarified by centrifugation (23,000 × g, 30 min), and applied to a Sephacryl S-100 column (5.7 cm2× 90 cm). The δ′ subunit was eluted (7 ml each) with 1.1 liters of Buffer B at a flow rate of 30 ml/h. Activity peak fractions were combined to yield fraction VI (70 ml, Table II). Purified δ′ (Fig.1 B) aliquots were immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C. Strains carrying holA and holB ochre alleles were constructed using the gene replacement system described by Linket al. (37Link A.J. Phillips D. Church G.A. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 6228-6237Crossref PubMed Scopus (754) Google Scholar). Genomic DNA from strain KA796 (ara,thi, Δprolac) (38Schaaper R.M. Danforth B.N. Glickman B.W. Gene (Amst.). 1985; 39: 181-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) was isolated using the Easy-DNA kit (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). The holA andholB genes were polymerase chain reaction-amplified (25 cycles each of 1 min at 94 °C, 1 min at 55 °C, and 2 min at 72 °C) using Pfu polymerase and primer sets A-1 and A-2 for holA or B-1 and B-2 for holB, respectively. The primers were designed to enable amplification of the completeholA or holB gene plus flanking regions of 500–600 base pairs on either side. In addition, the primers contained 1 or 2 mismatches to create BglII restriction sites for theholA gene and BclI sites for the holBgene, respectively. The resulting polymerase chain reaction products were extracted twice with phenol:chloroform:isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1) and digested with BglII or BclI. The digested fragments were inserted by ligation into the BamHI site of gene replacement vector pKO3 (37Link A.J. Phillips D. Church G.A. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 6228-6237Crossref PubMed Scopus (754) Google Scholar). This plasmid, which provides chloramphenicol resistance, carries a temperature-sensitive pSC101 replication origin, and all cloning steps were performed at 30 °C. The pKO3 derivatives carrying holA and holB were named pOA and pOB, respectively. Plasmid pOA(Oc) containing two consecutive ochre (TAA) codons (amino acid positions 116 and 117 ofholA) and plasmid pOB(Oc) containing two consecutive ochre codons (positions 47 and 48 of holB) were constructed using the QuickChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The mutagenic primer pairs were A-5 and A-6 for holAand B-3 and B-4 for holB. The presence of the desired substitutions was confirmed by DNA sequencing of the entireholA or holB gene on pOA(Oc) and pOB(Oc), respectively; no unexpected changes were found. For replacement of the chromosomal hol genes by the ochre derivatives, pOA(Oc) and pOB(Oc) were introduced into strain KA796 by electroporation, and chloramphenicol-resistant transformants were isolated on LB-chloramphenicol plates at 43 °C. Due to the inability of pKO3 to replicate at 43 °C, the only transformants obtained at this temperature are recombinants in which the plasmid has integrated, by homologous recombination, into the chromosome using the homology between the plasmid insert and the corresponding chromosomal sequence (37Link A.J. Phillips D. Church G.A. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 6228-6237Crossref PubMed Scopus (754) Google Scholar). The result is a partial diploid strain carrying two copies of the gene of interest (one wild-type and one mutant) separated by the plasmid sequence. Subsequent growth of the integrants at 30 °C allows for plasmid excision by reversal of the process. Either the wild-type or the mutant copy may be excised, leaving behind the other copy in the chromosome. Several individual integrants for each construct were picked, inoculated into 5 ml of LB-chloramphenicol, and grown to saturation at 30 °C. T"
https://openalex.org/W2043751870,"Plasmatocyte-spreading peptide (PSP) is a 23-amino acid cytokine that activates a class of insect immune cells called plasmatocytes. The tertiary structure of PSP consists of an unstructured N terminus (residues 1–6) and a well structured core (residues 7–23). A prior study indicated that deletion of the N terminus from PSP eliminated all biological activity. Alanine substitution of the first three residues (Glu1-Asn2-Phe3) further indicated that only replacement of Phe3 resulted in a loss of activity equal to the N-terminal deletion mutant. Here, we characterized structural determinants of the N terminus. Adding a hydroxyl group to the aromatic ring of Phe3 (making a Tyr) greatly reduced activity, whereas the addition of a fluorine (p-fluoro) did not. Substitutions that changed the chirality or replaced the aromatic ring of Phe3 with a branched aliphatic chain (making a Val) also greatly decreased activity. The addition of a methylene group to Val (making a Leu) partially restored activity, whereas the removal of a methylene group from Phe (phenyl-Gly) eliminated all activity. These results indicated that a branched carbon chain with a methylene spacer at the third residue is the minimal structural motif required for activity. The deletion of Glu1 also eliminated activity. Additional experiments identified the charged N-terminal amine and backbone of Glu1 as key determinants for activity.

Plasmatocytes normally circulate freely in the open hemocoel of lepidopteran insects (moths and butterflies), but when activated they gain the capacity to attach to foreign or damaged surfaces. Plasmatocyte-spreading peptide (PSP),1 a 23-amino acid cytokine identified from the moth Pseudoplusia includens, is the most potent known activator of plasmatocytes (4Clark K. Pech L.L. Strand M.R.

Strand M.R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 250: 479-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). This biologically inactive precursor is then cleaved by an unknown protease to release the mature peptide. The structure of PSP consists of a disordered N terminus (residues 1–6) and a well structured core (residues 7–22) stabilized by a disulfide bond, hydrophobic interactions, and a short β-hairpin turn (Fig.1A) (8Volkman B.J.

Comparison with other proteins reveals that despite sequence identity at only four positions, the core region of PSP adopts a very similar structure to the C-terminal subdomain of human epidermal growth factor (hEGF) and the fifth domain of the anticoagulant protein thrombomodulin (hTM5). In contrast, the N terminus of PSP is similar only to other members of the ENF peptide family (8Volkman B.J. Anderson M.E. Clark K.D. Hayakawa Y. Strand M.R. Markley J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4493-4496Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Previous alanine scanning mutagenesis experiments identified several residues critical for the plasmatocyte-spreading activity of PSP (9Clark K.D. Volkman B.J. Thoetkiattikul H. King D. Hayakawa Y. Strand M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 18491-18496Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). In the structured core, these include Cys7 and Cys19, which form the disulfide bond required for the proper three-dimensional structure of PSP, and the charged residue Arg13 within the β-hairpin. The unstructured N terminus is also essential, because deletion of the first six residues of PSP eliminates all biological activity. Ala replacement of Phe3 abolished activity in a manner identical to deletion of the entire N terminus, whereas Ala replacement of Glu1 and Asn2 enhanced activity in comparison to wild-type PSP (9Clark K.D.

In this study we further characterized the structural features of the N terminus required for PSP activity by bioassaying mutants with specific alterations to the ENF sequence. Our results indicated that determinants of Phe3 required for activity include its chirality, aromatic ring, and the distance of this ring from the peptide backbone. We also determined that the primary amine and backbone of Glu1 are required for function. P. includens larvae were reared on an artificial diet at 27 °C and a 16-h light/8-h dark photoperiod (10Strand M.R. Ann. Entomol. Soc. Am. 1990; 83: 538-544Crossref Google Scholar). The moths were fed 20% sucrose in water and maintained under identical environmental conditions. Plasmatocytes account for ∼30% of the total circulating hemocyte population in fifth instarP. includens larvae (11Pech L.L. Strand M.R. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 2053-2060PubMed Google Scholar, 12Gardiner E.M.M. Strand M.R. J. Insect Physiol. 1999; 45: 113-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). For this study, total hemocytes were collected from P. includens larvae into anticoagulant buffer (98 mm NaOH, 186 mm NaCl, 17 mm Na2EDTA, and 41 mm citric acid, pH adjusted to 4.5) as described by Clark et al. (9Clark K.D. Volkman B.J. Thoetkiattikul H. King D. Hayakawa Y. Strand M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 18491-18496Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Plasmatocytes were then isolated to high purity from other hemocyte types using Percoll step gradients made in 12 × 75-mm plastic tubes (Falcon 352058). Gradients were made in Ex-cell 400 in two layers: a 2-ml bottom layer of 62.5% Percoll (100% Percoll equals 9 parts Percoll to 1 part 10× Pringle's saline (150 mmNaCl2, 2.5 mm KCl, 1 mmCaCl2, 20 mm dextrose)), and a 2-ml top layer of 52.5% Percoll. Plasmatocytes with an average purity of 93% were collected from the 52.5–62.5% Percoll interface, and the other hemocyte types (granular cells, spherule cells, and oenocytoids) banded elsewhere in the gradient. The number of plasmatocytes collected per gradient ranged from 1.0–1.4 × 106 cells with the primary contaminant being granular cells. The plasmatocyte-spreading activity of mutant and wild-type peptides was bioassayed in 96-well culture plates (Corning) using previously established methods (4Clark K. Pech L.L. Strand M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23440-23447Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Peptides were first dissolved in Pringle's saline. Plates were prepared by adding a given peptide solution (6 μl at 10× the desired final concentration) to each well. Wells were then filled with 54 μl of Ex-cell 400 medium that contained 1 × 103 plasmatocytes. The percentage of plasmatocytes that spread in an assay was scored 1 h after adding peptide by counting 100 cells from a randomly selected field of view. Plasmatocytes were scored as spread if they assumed a flattened morphology and were ≥ 35 μm along their longest axis (4Clark K. Pech L.L. Strand M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23440-23447Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 13Pech L.L. Trudeau D. Strand M.R. Cell Tissue Res. 1994; 277: 159-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Unspread plasmatocytes remained spheroidal in shape. Each mutant peptide was bioassayed four times using an independently collected sample of plasmatocytes. Bioassays with each mutant peptide were always paired with bioassays of wild-type PSP to control for any variation in spreading response that might exist between plasmatocyte samples. The estimated maximum spreading response was defined as the percentage of plasmatocytes that spread when cultured in the highest concentration of peptide tested (100 μm). The lowest concentration of peptide that induced ≥ 5% of plasmatocytes to spread was referred to as the threshold spreading response. Threshold spreading responses were determined empirically from dose-response curves. All peptides were synthesized using Fmoc chemistry. The resin-peptide was cleaved and deprotected for 4 h in reagent K (14King D.S. Fields C.G. Fields G.B. Int. J. Pept. Protein Res. 1990; 36: 255-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (730) Google Scholar), a mixture containing 5% phenol, 1.25% water, 2.5% thioanisole, and 2.5% dithioethane in trifluoroacetic acid. After removing the resin from the reaction mixture by filtration, the peptide was precipitated in coldt-butylmethyl ether followed by repeated ether washes and air drying. Peptides were resuspended in 10 mm TRIS-HCl, pH 8.0, at a concentration of 1 mg/ml. Disulfide bond formation was periodically monitored by 5-μl injections onto an HPLC (Rheodyne 9725i manual injector, Hitachi l-6220 pump, Hitachi L-4500A photodiode array detector, and Hitachi D-7000 chromatography software), on which the reduced and oxidized peptides eluted in separate peaks on a C18 column (5-μm particle size, 4.6 mm × 25 cm, Supelco 58298) using HPLC-grade H2O (Sigma-Aldrich) and a linear gradient of acetonitrile (0–80 min, 20–60%) at 0.5 ml/min. Both the H2O and acetonitrile contained 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid. After the conversion was complete, the sample was purified by a series of 4–7-ml injections onto a preparatory HPLC column (10-μm particle size, 21.2 mm × 25 cm, Jupiter C18, Phenomenex, Inc., Torrance, CA) using HPLC-grade H2O and a linear gradient of acetonitrile (0–70 min, 10–80%) at 9 ml/min. The desired peak was identified by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry, and disulfide bond formation was confirmed by NMR. After numerous purification runs, peaks were pooled, lyophilized, and resuspended in HPLC-grade H2O for the determination of amino acid composition and concentration. NMR samples were prepared by dissolving lyophilized peptide in 0.5 ml of resuspension buffer (90% H2O/10% D2O and 20 mm sodium phosphate, pH adjusted to 6.0). Peptide concentrations ranged from 0.5 to 1.0 mm. All NMR spectra were recorded at 10 °C on Bruker DMX600 or DMX750 spectrometers equipped with triple-resonance (1H/13C/15N) probes and three-axis pulsed-field gradient capabilities. One-dimensional 1H spectra were acquired with 4096 complex points and a spectral width of 12.5 ppm. All Fourier transformations of NMR data were performed with nmrPipe (15Delagalio F. Grzesiek S. Vuister G. Zhu G. Pfeifer J. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 6: 277-293PubMed Google Scholar), and chemical shift assignments were obtained using the program XEASY (8Volkman B.J. Anderson M.E. Clark K.D. Hayakawa Y. Strand M.R. Markley J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4493-4496Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). All1H dimensions were referenced to 2,2-dimethyl-2-silapentane-5-sulfonate. As noted previously, the first three residues of PSP (Glu1, Asn2, and Phe3) are conserved among all ENF peptide family members (Fig.1, A and B). Prior studies indicated that Ala substitution at either Glu1 or Asn2 resulted in mutant peptides with higher plasmatocyte-spreading activity than wild-type PSP, whereas Ala substitution at Phe3 eliminated all spreading activity (9Clark K.D. Volkman B.J. Thoetkiattikul H. King D. Hayakawa Y. Strand M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 18491-18496Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). To further characterize the importance of Phe3 for PSP function, we synthesized mutants with specific modifications to this residue (Fig. 1C). Because the α-carbon of Phe is chiral, the first mutant we synthesized substituted the normall-Phe with d-Phe. This enantiomer (F3F(D)) had no plasmatocyte-spreading activity (Fig.2A), which suggests that the binding site for the putative PSP receptor depends on thel-chirality of this residue. We next tested mutants that altered the aromatic ring of Phe3 at the paraposition (Fig. 1C). The addition of a fluorine (p-fluoro) did not alter activity appreciably, yet the addition of a hydroxyl group, converting Phe3 to a tyrosine residue (F3Y), destroyed activity (Fig. 2A). This loss of activity for the F3Y mutant could be caused by the larger van der Waals radius of the hydroxyl group compared with fluorine, which in turn could prevent the F3Y mutant from fitting into the putative receptor binding pocket. Alternatively, a hydroxyl group by virtue of its dipole moment is more hydrophilic than a fluorine, which could reduce binding of the aromatic ring to a hydrophobic pocket. We next synthesized a peptide that preserved the aromatic ring of Phe3 but that moved its position closer to the peptide backbone by removing the methylene (β-CH2) spacer (Fig. 1C). This mutant (phenyl-Gly) also had little activity, suggesting that interaction of PSP with its receptor depends on the aromatic ring of Phe3 being at an appropriate distance from the peptide backbone (Fig. 2A). Our final manipulations replaced Phe3 with a valine or leucine to determine whether the branched portion of the aromatic ring structure was sufficient for biological activity (Fig. 1C). The F3V mutant had no spreading activity up to 100 μm, whereas F3L had only 50-fold less activity than wild-type PSP (Fig. 2B). Because leucine only differs from valine by an additional methylene group (β-CH2), we speculate that F3L maintains activity because it preserves in part the branched structure of the aromatic ring and has a long enough spacer for the side chain to insert into its binding pocket. Because Ala substitution at Glu1 (E1A) or Asn2 (N2A) increases activity over wild-type PSP, we assessed whether PSP activity could be enhanced further by Ala substitution at both Glu1 and Asn2. This mutant (AA-PSP) exhibited activity that was 100–1000-fold greater than wild-type PSP at all concentrations, making it the most active PSP analog identified to date (Fig.3). We then synthesized truncated PSPs lacking Glu1 and Asn2. Neither the Glu1 (PSP-(2-23)) nor Glu1-Asn2 deletion mutants (PSP-(3-23)) had any spreading activity despite the presence of Phe3 (Fig. 3). These results suggested first that Glu1 is potentially more essential than Asn2. They also suggested that the backbones of the first two residues are more important for function than their specific side chains given that AA-PSP has higher activity than the wild-type peptide. We tested this idea by replacing Glu1with a glycine (E1G), which resulted in a mutant with only the backbone of Glu1 (Fig. 1B), and which also lacked the methyl group side chain present when Glu1 was replaced by Ala (E1A). Like the E1A mutant (9Clark K.D. Volkman B.J. Thoetkiattikul H. King D. Hayakawa Y. Strand M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 18491-18496Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), E1G had higher activity than wild-type PSP (Fig. 4). This confirmed the importance of the Glu1 backbone and also implicated the primary amine at the N terminus as the most likely functional group required for activity. The necessity of the primary amine was tested in bioassays using an E1G-like mutant lacking the N-terminal amine. This acetylated PSP mutant, designated AcPSP-(2-23) (see Fig. 1B), had no activity (Fig. 4). An acetylated version of wild-type PSP (AcPSP) (Fig. 1B) also lacked activity (Fig. 4). The loss of function for these mutants could be caused by acetylation either blocking interaction of the amine with its binding target via steric hindrance or elimination of the positive charge of the primary amine (ammonium). In this regard, we also note that the 142-amino acid pro-PSP peptide lacks plasmatocyte-spreading activity (7Clark K. Witherell A. Strand M.R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 250: 479-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar).2 Many factors could account for the lack of activity of the PSP precursor protein, but based on these results it is tempting to speculate that activity depends on cleavage of the precursor protein to form the N-terminal amine at Glu1. What remains unclear is why all ENF peptide family members have a glutamic acid and asparagine residue in the first two positions when other residues such as alanine or glycine clearly result in peptides with much higher biological activity.Figure 4In vitro spreading responses of plasmatocytes to mutant peptides with altered N termini in relation to wild-type PSP. Mutants assayed were glycine replacement of Glu1 (E1G), deletion of the terminal amine in the E1G mutant (AcPSP(2–23)), and deletion of the terminal amine in wild-type PSP (AcPSP). Peptides were bioassayed as described in the Fig. 2 legend.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Although the ENF sequence is critical for PSP function, the tripeptide ENF had no plasmatocyte-spreading activity (Fig. 5). The ENF tripeptide also had no activity when bioassayed in combination with the N-terminal deletion mutant that lacked the first six residues of wild-type PSP (PSP-(7-23)) (Fig. 5). Because we had determined previously that PSP-(7-23) alone lacks plasmatocyte-spreading activity (9Clark K.D. Volkman B.J. Thoetkiattikul H. King D. Hayakawa Y. Strand M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 18491-18496Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), we conclude that a covalent connection between the unstructured and structured domains of PSP is required for function. To assess whether the position of the ENF motif is important for activity, we placed an additional glycine residue in the “linker” region between ENF and the C terminus (ENFNG3C). This peptide had similar activity to wild-type PSP (data not shown). Most of the mutant peptides tested here had reduced plasmatocyte-spreading activity in comparison to wild-type PSP. The complete loss of activity of PSP-(2-23) and PSP-(3-23) was particularly surprising given that Ala substitution for Glu1 and Asn2 increased activity. Although these mutants all targeted the unstructured N-terminal domain of PSP, we compared them to wild-type PSP by NMR spectroscopy to ensure that altered activity was not caused by a change in overall tertiary structure. Because amide proton shifts are very sensitive to secondary and tertiary protein structure, we found in previous studies that changes in the β-hairpin or hydrophobic core of PSP mutants relative to wild-type could be detected by changes in chemical shift (>0.5 ppm) (9Clark K.D. Volkman B.J. Thoetkiattikul H. King D. Hayakawa Y. Strand M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 18491-18496Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Here, we found no difference in the 1H NMR spectra of PSP-(2-23) and PSP-(3-23) to that of wild-type, indicating that the loss of biological activity was not caused by significant alterations in structure (data not shown). For larger proteins, mutagenesis studies alone often cannot distinguish between residues critical for proper folding and residues required for receptor binding and/or biological activity. In contrast, the small size of PSP makes it especially well suited to a mutagenesis approach because of the relative ease of synthesizing peptides with precise alterations in individual residues and testing their effects on structure and biological activity. This and a previous study (9Clark K.D. Volkman B.J. Thoetkiattikul H. King D. Hayakawa Y. Strand M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 18491-18496Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) together identify several residues important for the structure and plasmatocyte-spreading activity of PSP. Within the core domain of PSP (residues 7–23), Cys7 and Cys19are required for the maintenance of a proper structure but likely have no direct role in interaction with the receptor. The core domain is also distinguished by four charged residues (Arg13, Asp16, Arg18, and Lys20) within the β-hairpin (8Volkman B.J. Anderson M.E. Clark K.D. Hayakawa Y. Strand M.R. Markley J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4493-4496Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Individually replacing these residues with Ala does not affect tertiary structure, but each does reduce activity with Ala substitution of Arg13 having the greatest effect (9Clark K.D. Volkman B.J. Thoetkiattikul H. King D. Hayakawa Y. Strand M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 18491-18496Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Ala replacement of residues in the unstructured N terminus similarly does not affect tertiary structure, but replacement of Phe3 or deletion of Glu1 both render PSP biologically inactive. Recently, we initiated studies to determine whether the R13A, F3A, and PSP-(2-23) mutants antagonize the plasmatocyte-spreading activity of wild-type PSP. 3K. D. Clark and M. R. Strand, unpublished results. Our preliminary results suggest that PSP-(2-23) blocks the spreading activity of wild-type PSP when each peptide is present in bioassays at equal concentrations. The F3A mutant also antagonizes wild-type peptide activity but must be present at a higher concentration to do so. In contrast, R13A does not antagonize the activity of wild-type PSP at any concentration. Although we have not yet measured receptor binding, the very similar tertiary structure of the aforementioned mutants to wild-type PSP makes it likely that they would function as competitive inhibitors for receptor binding. If so, the antagonism experiments described above suggest that PSP-(2-23) and wild-type PSP have equivalent binding characteristics, whereas the lack of antagonistic activity for the R13A mutant is indicative of Arg13 being required for receptor binding. We also suggest that these results in combination with our other data offer clues as to how PSP might activate its receptor. The most reasonable scenario would be that the PSP receptor first recognizes the structured domain of PSP and interacts with the charged residues in the β-hairpin. As noted above, Ala replacement of these residues individually reduces activity, but together they present a charged motif (+-++) to the receptor that is likely very important for binding. This interaction “locks” the peptide into place, yet clearly does not activate the receptor given that deletion of the N terminus eliminates all biological activity. We thus hypothesize that binding of the structured domain to the receptor stabilizes the N terminus in a conformation that allows it to fit into its binding pocket. The binding energy for the N terminus derives from the structural features of Phe3, and only after Phe3 attaches is the charged N-terminal amine brought into place to activate the receptor. Identification of the PSP receptor is obviously key to testing these ideas, but previous studies of the platelet activator thrombin offers interesting parallels (16Scarborough R.M. Naughton M.A. Teng W. Hung D.T. Rose J. Vu T.-K.H. Wheaton V.I. Turck C.W. Coughlin S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13146-13149Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The thrombin receptor is activated when thrombin cleaves the N-terminal extension of its receptor to reveal a new N terminus that has a serine residue at position one and a phenylalanine at position two. This new extracellular domain then functions as a tethered ligand that self-activates the receptor. Of particular interest to this study, mutagenesis of the thrombin receptor indicates that both the N-terminal amine of Ser1 but not the side chain and the phenyl ring of Phe2 are required for receptor activation. Although the particular N-terminal residue and distance to the phenylalanine residue differ between this ligand and PSP, the overall similarities suggest a general mechanism for receptor activation that requires binding of an aromatic ring and a closely spaced primary amine with receptor-activating properties.

The different “conventional” myosins, or myosin IIs, are thought to underlie the contractile properties of the different muscle types. Myosin II is a hexameric protein made up of two heavy chains (MyHCs)1 (M r∼229,000) and four light chains (MLCs) (M r ∼18,000–27,000). The MyHCs consist of two separate domains: a globular head region and a rod region that assumes an α-helical coiled coil. The ATPase activity underlying muscle contraction is localized at the amino-terminal end that corresponds to the globular head and neck of the molecule. Also associated with this heavy chain domain are the MLCs (2Rayment I. Holden H.M. Whittaker M. Yohn C.B. Lorenz M. Holmes K.C. Milligan R.A.

Cardiac MyHC is encoded by two genes, α- and β-MyHC, and each heavy chain is associated with two MLC types, the regulatory MLC and essential MLCs (ELCs). X-ray crystallographic analyses have demonstrated that both the ELC and regulatory MLC are associated with the neck region of the MyHC (2Rayment I. Holden H.M. Whittaker M. Yohn C.B. Lorenz M.

Because the amino-terminal alanine- and proline-rich region of the ELC1a is shorter than that of the ELC1v, the amount of interaction between the ELC and actin may be reduced, effectively attenuating the tether action and leading to increased function (11Morano I. Haase H. FEBS Lett. 1997; 408: 71-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 12Schaub M.C. Hefti M.A. Zuellig R.A. Morano I. Cardiovasc. Res. 1998; 37: 381-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Thus, different ELC isoforms can regulate aspects of contractility in cardiac muscle. In vitro and NMR data showed that the amino-terminal region of ELC, encompassed within the first 11 residues of the ELC1f, ELC1a, and ELC1v isoforms, can bind to the carboxyl-terminal residues of actin where it presumably affects myosin-actin cross-bridge cycling (4Sweeney H.L. Biophys. J. 1995; 68: 112S-119SPubMed Google Scholar,12Schaub M.C. Hefti M.A. Zuellig R.A. Morano I. Cardiovasc. Res. 1998; 37: 381-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 13Andreev O.A.

Using a skinned fiber system, this ELC-actin interaction can be ablated by incubation with a synthetic peptide corresponding to amino acid residues 5–14 with a concomitant increase in the rate of fiber shortening (7Morano I. Ritter O. Bonz A. Timek T. Vahl C.F. Michel G. Circ. Res. 1995; 76: 720-725Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Similar experiments carried out with isolated rat cardiac myofibrils showed that exogenous peptide led to a stimulation of Mg2+-ATPase activity at submaximal Ca2+levels (8Rarick H.M. Opgenorth T.J. von Geldern T.W. Wu-Wong J.R. Solaro R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27039-27043Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The ELC-actin interaction depends on the regional charges; in particular, ELC lysines 3, 4, 8, and 9 appear to be important and interact with actin carboxyl-terminal residues Glu-360, Glu-361, Asp-363, and Glu-364 (4Sweeney H.L. Biophys. J. 1995; 68: 112S-119SPubMed Google Scholar). However, mutational analysis of actin in Dictyostelium revealed that Glu-360, Glu-361, Asp-363, and Glu-364 were not necessary for cross-bridge cycling (16Johara M. Toyoshima Y.Y. Ishijima A. Kojima H. Yanagida T. Sutoh K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 2127-2131Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Thus,in vivo the functional significance of the interaction between the ELC amino-terminal region and the actin carboxyl-terminal region is unclear. Using cardiac-specific promoters to drive expression in TG animals is an effective means of replacing endogenous sarcomeric components with transgenically encoded protein. The α-MyHC promoter can drive cardiac-specific TG expression such that ventricular and atrial sarcomeric isoforms can be efficiently exchanged with the TG-encoded species (17Fewell J.G. Hewett T.E. Sanbe A. Klevitsky R. Hayes E. Warshaw D. Maughan D. Robbins J. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 2630-2639Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 18Palermo J. Gulick J. Colbert M. Fewell J. Robbins J. Circ. Res. 1996; 78: 504-509Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Replacement of endogenous species with proteins containing single site mutations have also been reported (10Sanbe A. Gulick J. Hayes E. Warshaw D. Osinska H. Chan C.B. Klevitsky R. Robbins J. Am. J. Physiol. Heart Circ. Physiol. 2000; 279: H1355-H1364Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), allowing the structure-function relationships of single residues to be explored in vivo. To clarify the potential importance of the amino-terminal light chain-actin interactions within the whole organ and whole animal contexts, we created TG mice with cardiac-specific expression of mutated ELC1v and ELC1a isoforms. Lines of TG mice in which the endogenous ELC was replaced with a protein containing a 10-amino acid amino-terminal deletion between residues 5–14 were made. The data show that interactions mediated by this region of the protein are not essential for cross-bridge cycling in the heart. Previously isolated full-length murine ELC1a and ELC1v cDNAs were used as starting templates (17Fewell J.G. Hewett T.E. Sanbe A. Klevitsky R. Hayes E. Warshaw D. Maughan D. Robbins J. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 2630-2639Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar,19James J. Osinska H. Hewett T.E. Kimball T. Klevitsky R. Witt S. Hall D.G. Gulick J. Robbins J. Transgenic Res. 1999; 8: 9-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Primers with SalI sites engineered at the termini were made to the 3′- and 5′-untranslated regions of the cDNA. The 5′ primer also contained the mutated bases necessary to delete the amino-terminal amino acid residues KPEPKKETAK in ELC1a and KPEPKKDDAK in ELC1v (Fig. 1B). The polymerase chain reaction product was sequenced, and the fragment was linked to the mouse α-MyHC promoter. The final constructs containing a deleted ELC1v from position 5–14 (ELC1vΔ5–14) and a deleted ELC1a at the same region (ELC1aΔ5–14) were digested free of vector sequence with NotI, purified from agarose, and used to generate TG mice as described previously (20Sanbe A. Fewell J.G. Gulick J. Osinska H. Lorenz J. Hall D.G. Murray L.A. Kimball T.R. Witt S.A. Robbins J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21085-21094Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Transcript analysis was performed by RNA blots with transcript-specific probes as described previously (20Sanbe A. Fewell J.G. Gulick J. Osinska H. Lorenz J. Hall D.G. Murray L.A. Kimball T.R. Witt S.A. Robbins J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21085-21094Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). For myofibrillar protein analysis, the left ventricular apex and atrial flaps were obtained from euthanized ELC1v, ELC1a, ELC1vΔ5–14 TG, ELC1aΔ5–14 TG, and nontransgenic (NTG) mice. Myofibrillar sample preparation, gel preparation, electrophoretic conditions, and gel staining have been described previously (20Sanbe A. Fewell J.G. Gulick J. Osinska H. Lorenz J. Hall D.G.

For fiber isolation and analysis, the animals were heparinized (500 IU/kg intraperitoneally) and then euthanized with CO2. After a thoracotomy, the heart was removed and placed in relaxing solution (5.37 mmATP, 30 mm phosphocreatine, 5.0 mm EGTA, 20.0 mm BES, 7.33 mm MgCl2, 0.12 mm CaCl2, 10 mmdithiothreitol, 10 µg/ml leupeptin, 32 mmpotassium methanesulfonate, and 240 units/ml creatine phosphokinase (pCa 8.0, pH 7.0, ionic strength 175 mm)) at 4 °C. The solution contained 30 mm 2,3-butanedione monoxime to protect the myocardial tissue from cutting injury (10Sanbe A. Gulick J. Hayes E. Warshaw D. Osinska H. Chan C.B. Klevitsky R. Robbins J. Am.

Invest. 1998; 102: 1292-1300Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Small sections of either left ventricular papillary muscles or left atrial trabeculae were dissected in the 2,3-butanedione monoxime relaxing solution to yield 0.5-mm-diameter and 2–3-mm-long strips. The strips were skinned by incubation in 5.5 mm ATP, 5.0 mm EGTA, 20.0 mm BES, 6.13 mmMgCl2, 0.11 mm CaCl2, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 10 µg/ml leupeptin, 121.8 mm potassium methanesulfonate (pCa 8.0, pH 7.0, ionic strength 175 mm), and 50% glycerol containing 0.5 w/v% Triton X-100 for 12 h at 4 °C. Strips were transferred into the same solution minus detergent and stored at −20 °C. The skinned fiber experiments were performed using a commercially available apparatus (Scientific Instruments, Heidelberg, Germany). Fibers were dissected into bundles of 125–175-µm diameter, 1.3–2.0-mm long under a dissecting microscope and mounted isometrically between a force transducer (KG3, Scientific Instruments) and a length-step generator in relaxing solution. Sarcomere length at resting tension was always 2.0 µm. Contracting solution had the same composition as the relaxing solution except that EGTA was substituted with 5 mmCa-EGTA. The free Ca2+ concentration was obtained by mixing the relaxing and contraction solutions in the appropriate proportions. Strip tension (millinewton/mm2) was calculated by dividing force by fiber cross-sectional area calculated from widths measured at the major axis. Activating solution had the same ionic composition as relaxing solution. The solutions were formulated by solving a set of simultaneous equations describing the multiple equilibrium of ions in the solutions. A total of four constructs were used in these studies (Fig.1 A). To rule out any phenotype due to overexpression of either the atrial- or ventricular-specific ELC isoforms, lines carrying the wild type cDNAs (18Palermo J. Gulick J. Colbert M. Fewell J. Robbins J. Circ. Res. 1996; 78: 504-509Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 19James J. Osinska H. Hewett T.E. Kimball T. Klevitsky R. Witt S. Hall D.G. Gulick J. Robbins J. Transgenic Res. 1999; 8: 9-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) were used as controls along with NTG animals. Although previous in vitro studies focused exclusively on the amino terminus of the ventricular isoform, we extended these studies to include the atrial isoform as well. The amino-terminal extension is shorter in ELC1a but also contains the 5–14-residue region (KPEPKK(D/E)(D/T)AK) that has been implicated in actin binding (Fig. 1 B). Multiple lines were generated for each TG construct; for the purposes of this study we focused on lines that yielded high levels of replacement. For each of the constructs expressing the wild type proteins, lines were used in which replacement in the ectopic cardiac compartment was >90%: both the ELC1a and ELC1v “wild type” lines have been reported previously (18Palermo J. Gulick J. Colbert M. Fewell J. Robbins J. Circ. Res. 1996; 78: 504-509Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 19James J. Osinska H. Hewett T.E. Kimball T. Klevitsky R. Witt S. Hall D.G. Gulick J. Robbins J. Transgenic Res. 1999; 8: 9-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The ELC1vΔ5–14 TG line 188 showed significant levels of replacement (Fig. 1 C). Analyses of ventricular RNA levels showed that line 188 had a 15.6-fold increase as compared with the endogenous transcript (data not shown) resulting in ∼85% replacement (Fig. 1 C). The ELC1aΔ5–14 line used in the studies below (line 22) had 21.7-fold higher atrial transcript levels as compared with the endogenous ELC1a. This level of TG expression resulted in >95% replacement of ELC1a in the atria (Fig.1 C). The overall appearance, behavior, morbidity, and mortality of the Δ5–14 lines were all unremarkable. Histological analyses revealed normal cell morphology, the striations characteristic of cardiac muscle, and no fibrosis (data not shown). Over the animals' lifetimes, they were monitored carefully for cardiac disease using both invasive (e.g. sacrificing animals at 6, 12, and 15 months) as well as noninvasive means such as echocardiography (20Sanbe A. Fewell J.G. Gulick J. Osinska H. Lorenz J. Hall D.G. Murray L.A. Kimball T.R. Witt S.A. Robbins J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21085-21094Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). The only response noted was a slight increase in ventricular weights in the ELC1aΔ5–14 animals. Whereas all heart chamber weights in ELC1vΔ5–14 TG mice were unremarkable, the ELC1aΔ5–14 TG mice did show a statistically significant increase in the left ventricular weight (TableI). Previously we showed that an ELC1v → ELC1a protein replacement has no effect on chamber mass (17Fewell J.G. Hewett T.E. Sanbe A. Klevitsky R. Hayes E. Warshaw D. Maughan D. Robbins J. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 2630-2639Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), so that the minor hypertrophic response may in fact be because of the deletion at the amino terminus. However, it should be noted that both ELC1v → ELC1vΔ5–14 and ELC1a → ELC1aΔ5–14 caused no hypertrophy, so it appears as if the deletion must also be coupled with an isoform switch to produce the effect.Table IHeart:body weight and chamber:body weightVent.:BWLV:BWRV:BWAtria:BWmg/gNTG (n = 6)4.46 ± 0.113.63 ± 0.090.87 ± 0.050.46 ± 0.02ELC1v (TG line 66) (n = 4)4.53 ± 0.223.60 ± 0.160.93 ± 0.080.42 ± 0.02ELC1vΔ5–14 (TG line 188) (n = 4)4.50 ± 0.183.51 ± 0.140.95 ± 0.060.46 ± 0.02ELC1a (TG line 34) (n = 4)4.57 ± 0.143.65 ± 0.130.91 ± 0.030.43 ± 0.03ELC1aΔ5–14 (TG line 22) (n = 4)4.73 ± 0.113.82 ± 0.091-aSignificant difference from NTG (p < 0.05).0.92 ± 0.030.41 ± 0.02All values are mean ± S.E.

On the basis of the in vitro data, which were obtained using fiber preparations in which varying amounts of inhibitory peptides were added prior to any measurements, we expected to see changes in either the enzymatic and/or mechanic parameters in the EL1vΔ5–14 TG mice and possibly in the ELC1aΔ5–14 animals as well. To this end we first examined the Mg2+-ATPase activities and Ca2+-force relationships using skinned fiber preparations derived from the left ventricular papillary muscles of the relevant TG lines (Fig. 2and Table II). In contrast to the data obtained using the peptide inhibitors, no differences in either the Mg2+-ATPase activity (Table II) or in maximum force development as a function of the Ca2+ concentration (Fig. 2 A) were detected in the ELC1vΔ5–14 TG mice. Previously we have shown that expression of ELC1a in the ventricle did not lead to changes in these parameters (10Sanbe A. Gulick J. Hayes E. Warshaw D. Osinska H. Chan C.B. Klevitsky R. Robbins J. Am. J. Physiol. Heart Circ. Physiol. 2000; 279: H1355-H1364Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Similar results were obtained when the (atrial) fibers containing essentially complete replacement of the endogenous protein with ELC1aΔ5–14 were examined (Table II and Fig. 2B).Table IICa2+-stimulated Mg2+-ATPase activitiesNTGELC1v (TG)ELC1vΔ5–14ELC1a (TG)ELC1aΔ5–14Atrial tissue214 ± 25NDND227 ± 2239 ± 13Ventricular tissue220 ± 14232 ± 4234 ± 13NDNDAll values are mean ± S.E.

Ca2+-stimulated Mg2+-ATPase activity (nmol/min/mg of protein) was determined by subtracting the activity at pCa 5.0 from the activity at pCa 8.0. ND, not determined. We next examined the unloaded shortening velocities, maximum shortening velocities, and maximum relative power in the TG experimental cohorts. Previous experiments have indicated that expression of ELC1v in the heart does not lead to changes in these ventricular parameters (10Sanbe A. Gulick J. Hayes E. Warshaw D. Osinska H. Chan C.B. Klevitsky R. Robbins J. Am. J. Physiol. Heart Circ. Physiol. 2000; 279: H1355-H1364Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Surprisingly replacement of the endogenous protein with the ELC1vΔ5–14 species resulted in values identical to the NTG controls (Fig. 3, A, B, andC). Similar results were obtained when the (atrial) fibers containing essentially complete replacement of the endogenous protein with ELC1aΔ5–14 were examined (Fig. 3, D, E, and F). The amino-terminal residues that were deleted in both ELC1v and ELC1a contain an actin-binding site (7Morano I. Ritter O. Bonz A. Timek T. Vahl C.F. Michel G. Circ. Res. 1995; 76: 720-725Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 15Timson D.J. Trayer H.R. Trayer I.P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 255: 654-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), and deletion of these residues might affect ELC-actin interactions, markedly attenuating the actin affinities of the proteins. Incubation of chemically skinned human ventricular fibers with the 5–14 amino-terminal peptide, KPEPKKDDAK, presumably saturated the carboxyl-terminal binding site of actin, resulting in an increase in isometric tension generation at both submaximal and maximal Ca2+ activation states (7Morano I. Ritter O. Bonz A. Timek T. Vahl C.F. Michel G. Circ. Res. 1995; 76: 720-725Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Additional experiments carried out with similar methodology showed that the ELC1v amino-terminal fragment induced a supramaximal increase in fiber Mg2+-ATPase activity at submaximal Ca2+levels with no effect at low and maximum Ca2+ levels (8Rarick H.M. Opgenorth T.J. von Geldern T.W. Wu-Wong J.R. Solaro R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27039-27043Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Although our data do not bear directly on the potential of an exogenous peptide to modulate fiber inotropy, all the data strongly indicate that the protein interactions between the amino-terminal 5–14 ELC region and the carboxyl terminus of actin are not essential for myosin motor function in vivo. These results are consistent with data that were obtained when charge reversal mutations at the actin carboxyl terminus acidic residues (E360H, E361H, D363H, and E364H) were made; these did not significantly affect either sliding velocities or force generation in actin motility analyses (16Johara M. Toyoshima Y.Y. Ishijima A. Kojima H. Yanagida T. Sutoh K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 2127-2131Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Based on the stoichiometric ratios of peptide to actin or the thin filament that were used (8Rarick H.M. Opgenorth T.J. von Geldern T.W. Wu-Wong J.R. Solaro R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27039-27043Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), the amount of peptide required for the stimulatory effect is relatively high (4 peptides:1 thin filament). Yet cross-linking studies showed that the amino terminus of the ELC could only reach the carboxyl terminus of actin when MyHC binds to two actin protomers (23Andreev O.A. Borejdo J. Circ. Res. 1997; 81: 688-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Our data argue against the physiological importance of the proposed ELC-actin binding in regulating cross-bridge kinetics or the development of force with respect to Ca2+ concentrations.In vitro data suggested that the ELC1v amino-terminal peptide directly activates Mg2+-ATPase activity through an interaction with actin. This in turn results in a cooperative activation to the entire thin filament (8Rarick H.M. Opgenorth T.J. von Geldern T.W. Wu-Wong J.R. Solaro R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27039-27043Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Under in vivoconditions where fiber stoichiometry and integrity is maintained, we were unable to discern any effect on enzymatic, kinetic, or mechanic parameters. Confirming the lack of any effect, a similar mutation made in the atrial isoform also resulted in normal fiber parameters. Because replacement was almost complete in the ELC1vΔ5–14 line 188 mice and essentially complete (>95%) in the ELC1aΔ5–14 line, it appears that residues 5–14 are not vital for maintenance of fiber integrity or function in vivo. Conservation of function over the lifetime of the animal is confirmed by the complete lack of increased morbidity or mortality in the TG cohorts. We believe it probable that the faster cycling rates that are observed in ELC1a and ELC3f fibers relative to ELC1v-containing fibers may reflect differential stabilizing effects in the neck region of MyHC. We thank Lisa Martin for excellent technical assistance."
https://openalex.org/W1978146137,"The characteristic morphological and biochemical changes during caspase-mediated apoptosis can be reproduced to a large extent in a Xenopus laevis egg extract cell-free system by addition of mouse liver nuclei and exogenous cytochromec. We show that in this system phosphocreatine accelerated the apoptotic morphological changes of the nuclei, but selectively inhibited DNA fragmentation. Western blot showed that the degradation of lamins A and C is accelerated, which is possibly responsible for the nuclear changes during cell apoptosis. However, the degradation of ICAD/DFF45-like protein in the egg extracts is inhibited in a time-dependent manner. Exogenous creatine, ATP, and several organic acids have no effect on DNA fragmentation, excluding the possibility that creatine, ATP, or acidic conditions resulting from phosphocreatine are responsible for inhibiting DNA fragmentation. Lithium chloride, a kinase inhibitor, can overcome the phosphocreatine effects and can restore DNA fragmentation. Our results indicate that phosphocreatine protects ICAD/DFF45-like protein from proteolysis, probably through kinase actions, resulting in its resistance to caspase cleavage and leading to an inhibition of DNA fragmentation."
