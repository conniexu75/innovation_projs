https://openalex.org/W1982356313,"A method is described to express and purify human DNA (cytosine-5) methyltransferase (human DNMT1) using a protein splicing (intein) fusion partner in a baculovirus expression vector. The system produces ∼1 mg of intact recombinant enzyme >95% pure per 1.5 × 109 insect cells. The protein lacks any affinity tag and is identical to the native enzyme except for the two C-terminal amino acids, proline and glycine, that were substituted for lysine and aspartic acid for optimal cleavage from the intein affinity tag. Human DNMT1 was used for steady-state kinetic analysis with poly(dI-dC)·poly(dI-dC) and unmethylated and hemimethylated 36- and 75-mer oligonucleotides. The turnover number (k cat) was 131–237 h−1 on poly(dI-dC)·poly(dI-dC), 1.2–2.3 h−1 on unmethylated DNA, and 8.3–49 h−1 on hemimethylated DNA. The Michaelis constants for DNA (K m CG) andS-adenosyl-l-methionine (AdoMet) (K m AdoMet) ranged from 0.33–1.32 and 2.6–7.2 μm, respectively, whereas the ratio ofk cat/K m CGranged from 3.9 to 44 (237–336 for poly(dI-dC)·poly(dI-dC)) × 106m−1 h−1. The preference of the enzyme for hemimethylated, over unmethylated, DNA was 7–21-fold. The values of k cat on hemimethylated DNAs showed a 2–3-fold difference, depending upon which strand was pre-methylated. Furthermore, human DNMT1 formed covalent complexes with substrates containing 5-fluoro-CNG, indicating that substrate specificity extended beyond the canonical CG dinucleotide. These results show that, in addition to maintenance methylation, human DNMT1 may also carry out de novo and non-CG methyltransferase activities in vivo.

Methylation of DNA in eukaryotes is implicated in various biological and developmental processes, such as gene regulation (2Graessmann M. Graessmann A. Jost J.P. Saluz H.P.

Genetic Instability and Hereditary Neurological Diseases. Academic Press, San Diego, CA1998: 27-46Google Scholar). The bulk of the methylation takes place during DNA replication in the S-phase of the cell cycle (8Leonhardt H. Page A.W. Weier H.U. Bestor T.H. Cell. 1992; 71: 865-873Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (809) Google Scholar). The maintenance methylation ensures the propagation of tissue-specific methylation patterns established during mammalian development. The methyl transfer reaction proceeds via nonspecific binding of the enzyme to DNA, recognition of the specific DNA target site, and recruitment of the methyl group donorS-adenosyl-l-methionine (AdoMet)1 to the active site of the enzyme. DNA (cytosine-5) methyltransferases (m5C MTase) introduce a methyl group onto carbon 5 of the target cytosine through a covalent intermediate between the protein and the target cytosine (9Wu J.C. Santi D.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 4778-4786Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). During this process, the cytosine is flipped 180° out of the DNA backbone into an active site pocket of the enzyme (10Klimasauskas S. Kumar S. Roberts R.J. Cheng X. Cell. 1994; 76: 357-369Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (909) Google Scholar). After completion of the methyl transfer reaction, the products, methylated DNA and S-adenosyl-l-homocysteine (AdoHcy), are released. Previous studies on the mechanism of methylation were mainly limited to prokaryotic m5C MTases although some limited kinetic studies have also been reported with mouse and human DNMT1 (11Flynn J. Glickman J.F. Reich N.O. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 7308-7315Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 12Kho M.R. Baker D.J. Laayoun A. Smith S.S. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 275: 67-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Eukaryotic m5C MTases have been cloned from various organisms such as mouse (13Bestor T. Laudano A. Mattaliano R. Ingram V. J. Mol.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 1214-1222Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The human DNMT1 has been localized to the chromosomal site 19 p13.2-p13.3 by fluorescence in situ hybridization (14Yen R.W. Vertino P.M. Yu B.D. Nelkin J.J. El-Deiry W. Cumaraswamy A. Lennon G.G. Trask B.J. Celano P. Baylin S.B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 2287-2291Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). The enzyme consists of a large N-terminal region and a smaller C-terminal region linked by a run of Gly-Lys dipeptide repeats (14Yen R.W. Vertino P.M. Yu B.D. Nelkin J.J. El-Deiry W. Cumaraswamy A. Lennon G.G. Trask B.J. Celano P. Baylin S.B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 2287-2291Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). The large N-terminal domain is unique to the eukaryotic m5C MTases. The smaller C-terminal domain has strong homology with prokaryotic m5C MTases and contains the elements necessary for catalysis (20Kumar S. Cheng X.D. Klimasauskas S. Sha M. Posfai J. Roberts R.J. Wilson G.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar). The function of the N terminus is poorly understood, and there is little sequence homology between plant and animal enzymes. Sequences within this domain have been implicated in Zn2binding (21Bestor T.H. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 2611-2617Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar), interaction with proliferating cell nuclear antigen (22Chuang L.S. Ian H.I. Koh T.W. Ng H.H. Xu G. Li B.F. Science. 1997; 277: 1996-2000Crossref PubMed Scopus (775) Google Scholar), and targeting to replication foci (8Leonhardt H. Page A.W. Weier H.U. Bestor T.H. Cell. 1992; 71: 865-873Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (809) Google Scholar). The full-length mouse m5C MTase is about 1700 amino acids in length and has a molecular mass of 183.5 kDa (23Pradhan S. Talbot D. Sha M. Benner J. Hornstra L. Li E. Jaenisch R. Roberts R.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 4666-4673Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Prokaryotic m5C MTases are usually part of restriction-modification systems and rarely discriminate between unmethylated or hemimethylated DNA substrates. In contrast, mammalian m5C MTases show a much higher reaction velocity on a hemimethylated DNA substrate (maintenance methylation), the product of semiconservative DNA replication, than on an unmethylated DNA substrate (de novo methylation). Methylation of single-stranded DNA by the mammalian m5C MTase is strongly stimulated by the presence of nearby 5-methylcytosines (24Christman J.K. Sheikhnejad G. Marasco C.J. Sufrin J.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7347-7351Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). This rate of methylation was comparable with that of hemimethylated DNA (24Christman J.K. Sheikhnejad G. Marasco C.J. Sufrin J.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7347-7351Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). It has been demonstrated that the human enzyme can also methylate non-B-DNA structures such as hairpins and mismatches (12Kho M.R. Baker D.J. Laayoun A. Smith S.S. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 275: 67-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Recently, a family of mammalian m5C MTases has been identified and hypothesized to serve as de novo methyltransferases (25Okano M. Xie S. Li E. Nat. Genet. 1998; 19: 219-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (1250) Google Scholar). The diverse role played by DNA methylation in mammals has motivated several groups to express mammalian m5C MTases inEscherichia coli (26Tollefsbol T.O. Hutchison III, C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18543-18550Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), baculovirus (23Pradhan S. Talbot D. Sha M. Benner J. Hornstra L. Li E. Jaenisch R. Roberts R.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 4666-4673Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 27Glickman J.F. Reich N.O. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 204: 1003-1008Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), and mammalian (COS) cells (28Czank A. Hauselmann R. Page A.W. Leonhardt H. Bestor T.H. Schaffner W. Hergersberg M. Gene (Amst.). 1991; 30: 259-263Crossref Scopus (23) Google Scholar). In the E. coli and COS cell expression systems, the amount of protein produced was low, whereas protein expression was high using the baculovirus system. Insect cells are rich in proteases, and long purification protocols often result in partial proteolytic degradation of proteins. To overcome the problem of degradation, we have constructed and expressed the human DNMT1 as a fusion protein with a Saccharomyces cerevisiae VMA1 intein gene (29Chong S. Shao Y. Paulus H. Benner J. Perler F.B. Xu M.-Q. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22159-22168Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). The C terminus of the human DNMT1 was fused to the N terminus of the intein. A small chitin-binding domain fromBacillus circulans has been added to the C terminus of the intein for affinity purification. Thus, the three-part fused human DNMT1 protein can be immobilized using chitin beads as an affinity matrix. 2M. E. Scott, S. Pradhan, and M. Q. Xu, submitted for publication. 2M. E. Scott, S. Pradhan, and M. Q. Xu, submitted for publication. Addition of dithiothreitol (DTT) at low temperature initiates cleavage on the column between the intein and the recombinant human DNMT1.2Whereas the intein and chitin-binding domain remain attached to the column, the purified recombinant enzyme is eluted. This purified recombinant human DNMT1 is identical with the native enzyme except for the two C-terminal amino acids. In this report, we have studied its steady-state kinetic parameters on double-stranded, unmethylated, and hemimethylated DNA substrates, which are representative of human genes. We also assayed methylation of non-CG sequences by human DNMT1. Human DNMT1 expression constructs were derived from pBKSHMT5.0 (b) (gift of Prof. S. Baylin, The Johns Hopkins University). This plasmid had the full-length human DNMT1 cDNA based on the previously published sequence (14Yen R.W. Vertino P.M. Yu B.D. Nelkin J.J. El-Deiry W. Cumaraswamy A. Lennon G.G. Trask B.J. Celano P. Baylin S.B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 2287-2291Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). A polymerase chain reaction of the 3′ end of the cDNA was used to incorporate anSmaI restriction endonuclease site in place of the stop codon of the cDNA and to provide the optimal amino acids for protein cleavage (sense primer, 5′-GGAATTCCATATGCATGACAGGAAGAACGGCCGCAGC-3′ and antisense primer, 5′-TGACCCGGGAGCAGCTTCCTCCTCCTTTATTTTAGC-3′). The restriction sites are underlined. This change causes the C-terminal amino acids lysine and aspartic acid to become proline and glycine. Substitution of these two amino acids at the C terminus of the mammalian DNMT1 had no effect on the methyl transfer reaction as compared with the native sequence enzyme as judged by methylase assay (data not shown). This polymerase chain reaction product of about 500 bp was digested with NdeI and SmaI and ligated to a baculovirus vector pVIC12 to give pΔVICHMT-4. This construct contains the 3′ end of the human DNMT1 cDNA in frame with the intein chitin-binding domain of the transfer vector pVIC1.2 pΔVICHMT-4 was digested with NruI andEagI and a 4.1-kbp EcoRV-EagI fragment from pBKSHMT5.0(b) was ligated to give the functional human DNMT1 transfer vector pVICHMT (Fig. 1). The ligated junctions in the final pVICHMT construct were verified by DNA sequencing. A pupal ovarian cell line (SF9) from the wormSpodoptera frugiperda was used for co-transfection and expression of the human DNMT1 as described previously (23Pradhan S. Talbot D. Sha M. Benner J. Hornstra L. Li E. Jaenisch R. Roberts R.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 4666-4673Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) with the following modifications. SF9 cells were maintained as a suspension culture in TNM-FH media (JRH Biosciences) supplemented with fetal calf serum 10% (v/v) and an antibiotic/antimycotic solution at a final concentration of 5 units of penicillin, 50 μg of streptomycin, and 0.125 μg of amphotericin B ml−1 at 27 °C on a Bellco steering platform at 70 rpm. Co-transfection of a monolayer of SF9 insect cells was carried out using BaculoGold DNA, a modified, linearized Autographa californica nuclear polyhedrosis virus (AcNPV) DNA (PharMingen) and the transfer vector pVICHMT. Four days after transfection, the supernatant was screened for recombinant baculovirus using the agarose overlay technique (31O'Reilly D.R. Miller L.K. Luckow V.A. Baculovirus Expression Vectors: A Laboratory Manual. W. H. Freeman & Co., New York1992: 124-127Google Scholar). Individual plaques were purified and amplified 2 to 3 times in order to reach a viral titer above 2 × 108 ml−1. Recombinant clones from individual plaque isolates were used for test expression by infecting 1.5 × 106 SF9 cells in a 60-mm Petri dish. Forty-eight hours post-infection the cell extracts were checked for methyltransferase activity and fusion protein expression by Western blot analysis using anti-intein antibody (New England Biolabs). For routine protein expression, SF9 cells were grown in spinner culture flasks. SF9 cells at a density of 1.4 × 106 ml−1 were infected at a multiplicity of infection between 5 and 7. The cells were kept at 27 °C at 60 rpm and harvested 48 h post-infection after a final wash with phosphate-buffered saline. For protein purification, infected cells (5.6 × 108) were resuspended in 15 ml of buffer M (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mmNa2EDTA, protease inhibitor mixture containing 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride, pepstatin A, E64, bestatin, leupeptin and aprotinin (Sigma), 0.2% (v/v) per ml of cell extract, 7 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 500 mm NaCl). The cell suspension was sonicated on ice for 30 s using a model W-225R (Heatsystem-Ultrasonics) sonicator in pulsed mode at 50% duty cycle. The extract was incubated on ice for 30 min with occasional shaking and was centrifuged at 11,000 × g for 30 min. If the supernatant remained cloudy, then one more centrifugation step was included. Purification from larger numbers (>1 × 109) of cells required an initial 40–70% ammonium sulfate fractionation. This supernatant was loaded on a chitin bead column (New England Biolabs) equilibrated with buffer M at 0.4 ml/min. The nonspecifically bound proteins were removed by washing with 30-column volumes of buffer M. On-column cleavage of the target protein was initiated by passing 2-column volumes of buffer M supplemented with 50 mm DTT. The column was closed, and the target protein was cleaved from the intein chitin binding domain by overnight incubation at 4 °C. Human DNMT1 was eluted with buffer M and dialyzed against buffer M supplemented with 0.2% (v/v) protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma), 7 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 100 mmNaCl, 50% glycerol (v/v), and 1 mm DTT. The purified protein was stored at −20 °C. The purity of the protein was checked by SDS-PAGE (4–20% Tris/glycine/SDS gradient gel). Purified protein was quantitated using the Bradford assay with bovine serum albumin as standard. m5C MTase assays were carried out at 37 °C, for 30 min in duplicate with a total volume of 25 μl of reaction mix. A typical reaction containedS-adenosyl-l- [methyl-3H]methionine (AdoMet) (specific activity 15 Ci/mmol, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), substrate DNA, and enzyme in assay buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 1 mm Na2EDTA, pH 8.0, 1 mm DTT, 7 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5% glycerol, and 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin). For kinetic analysis, the CG or CI concentrations were calculated from either substrate oligonucleotides or poly(dI-dC)·poly(dI-dC). One nm double-stranded oligonucleotide with 1 CG site is 2 nm CG. For poly(dI-dC)·poly(dI-dC), an average length of 7000 bp was used to determine the concentration of CI. For double-reciprocal plots, the concentrations of CG or CI and AdoMet were varied. The MTase reactions were stopped by transferring the reaction tubes to an ethanol/dry ice bath and were processed by spotting the reaction mix on DE81 paper circles (Whatman). These circles were washed sequentially with 4 × 1 ml of cold 0.2 m ammonium bicarbonate, 4 × 1 ml of Milli Q water, and 4 × 1 ml of ethanol using a manifold (Millipore) connected to a vacuum pump. The filters were dried; 3 ml of Opti-fluor (Packard) was added to each, and tritium incorporation was measured. To calculate counting efficiency, tritiated plasmid DNA (pUC DNA methylated with tritiated AdoMet using M.SssI) was either spotted on DE81 paper, processed, and counted or directly counted with Opti-fluor. The efficiency of [3H]DNA measurement was ∼55%, and all calculations were corrected accordingly. Data obtained were plotted by regression analysis using the GraphPad PRISM program (GraphPad Software Inc.) or SigmaPlot (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL). The equations used for fitting the data points and to obtain the kinetic constants, V max, KmCG, KmAdoMet, are reported elsewhere (32Bacolla A. Pradhan S. Roberts R.J. Wells R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33011-33019Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). These figures represent estimated values. Genomic DNA was isolated from SF9 cells 48 h post-infection with recombinant virus using the Easy DNA Kit (Invitrogen). The purified DNA was digested either byAatII, BsiEI, or SwaI, and the digested DNA fragments were separated on a 1% agarose gel in TBE buffer gel. The DNA in the gel was blotted on to Hybond-N+ and probed with a random-primed human DNMT1 clone. The blot was washed as described (33Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 9.52-9.55Google Scholar) and autoradiographed. Cell extracts were mixed with SDS loading dye with 2 μm Tris-(2-carboxyethyl) phosphine in place of DTT, boiled at 95 °C for 5 min, and loaded on a 4–20% Tris/glycine/SDS gradient gel. Tris-(2-carboxyethyl) phosphine is a strong reducing agent and does not take part in the cleavage process (34Burns J.A. Butler J.C. Morgan J. Whitesides G.M. J. Org. Chem. 1991; 56: 2648-2650Crossref Scopus (549) Google Scholar). The proteins were blotted on an Immobilin-P membrane and probed with an anti-intein antibody (New England Biolabs) followed by chemiluminescent detection of the human DNMT1. Duplex oligonucleotides containing 5-fluoro-2′-deoxycytidine (FdC) were32P-end-labeled using polynucleotide kinase and [γ-32P]ATP. Human DNMT1 (10 nm) was used with 5 nm fluorocytosine-containing oligonucleotide duplex in the presence of 50 μm cold AdoMet in 1× buffer M at 37 °C for 30 min. The reaction was stopped by adding SDS gel loading dye (one-third of the reaction volume) and boiling the sample at 100 °C for 5 min. The boiled protein/DNA mixtures were loaded and resolved on a 4–20% Tris/glycine/SDS gradient gel. The gel was dried and autoradiographed. Poly(dI-dC)·poly(dI-dC), average length 7000 bp, was obtained from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. The following oligonucleotides were synthesized at New England Biolabs. For the SNRPN exon-1: UMUS, d(CAGAGTGGAGCGGCCGCCGGAGATGCCTGACGCATCTGTCTGAGGAGCGGTCAGTGACGCGATGGAGCGGGCAAG); MUS, d(CAGAGTGGAGMGGCMGCMGGAGATGCCTGAMGCATCTGTCTGAGGAGMGGTCAGTGAMGMGATGGAGMGGGCAAG); UMLS, d(CTTGCCCGCTCCATCGCGTCACTGACCGCTCCTCAGACAGATGCGTCAGGCATCTCCGGCGGCCGCTCCACTCTG); MLS, d(CTTGCCMGCTCCATMGMGTCACTGACMGCTCCTCAGACAGATGMGTCAGGCATCTCMGGMGGCMGCTCCACTCTG). For the FMR-1 locus: UMUS, d(CGGCGGCGGCGGCGGCGGCGGCGGCGGCGGCGGCGG); MUS, d(MGGMGGMGGMGGMGGMGGMGGMGGMGGMGGMGGMGG); UMLS, d(CCGCCGCCGCCGCCGCCGCCGCCGCCGCCGCCGCCG); MLS, d(CMGCMGCMGCMGCMGCMGCMGCMGCMGCMGCMGCMG). For the FC oligo duplexes: FS (FG), d(GGAGATGTCFGCAACFGGATACFGAAGGAACCTGC); MLS, d(GCAGGTTCCTTMGGTATCMGGTTGMGGACATCTCC); FS (FCG), d(GGAGATGTFCGCAAFCGGATAFCGAAGGAACCTGC); FS (FWG), d(AGATGTGCFTGCFAGFTGAGFAGGATC); MLS (MWG), d(GATCMTGCTMAGMTGGMAGGCACATCT). The following abbreviations were used for oligonucleotide duplexes: UMUS, unmethylated upper strand; MUS, methylated upper strand; UMLS, unmethylated lower strand; MLS, methylated lower strand; FS, fluorocytosine strand; W is either A or T; M is 5-methylcytosine; and F is 5-fluoro-2′-deoxycytidine. Duplexes were prepared by annealing equimolar amounts of appropriate single strands. Complementary oligonucleotides were incubated in annealing buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mmNa2EDTA, and 100 mm NaCl) at 95 °C for 5 min followed by 65 °C for 15 min and 37 °C for 15 min. For the oligonucleotides corresponding to the CGG·CCG repeat of theFMR-1 locus, the annealing step was followed by cleavage with S1 nuclease. This additional step was included to eliminate any single-stranded nucleotide that resulted from imperfect annealing between the two complementary 36-mers. PAGE analyses of the annealed duplexes showed that ∼90% of the products had the expected length of 36 bp, whereas ∼10% were one repeat shorter (11 repeats, 33 bp in length). The full-length duplexes were purified on a 15% polyacrylamide gel, dissolved in TE, and stored at −20 °C. Co-transfection of the human DNMT1 transfer vector, pVICHMT, with linear AcNPV DNA (BaculoGold DNA, PharMingen) resulted in homologous recombination of the polyhedrin promoter and the DNMT1 cDNA carried by the construct (Fig. 1, A and B). Only the recombinant viruses are viable. The transfection supernatant was harvested and used for purification of several single plaques. Recombinant viral DNA from each of the plaques was isolated and checked for correct recombination of the human DNMT1-intein-chitin binding domain construct using restriction enzyme digestion and Southern blotting. The probe used was the full-length human DNMT1 cDNA. As expected, an SwaI digest gave an ∼10-kbp band, whereasAatII and BsiEI gave two bands each (Fig.1 C). Several clones had double homologous integration with the human DNMT1 coding sequence lying downstream of the polyhedrin promoter, and one, VICHMT8, was used for all further expression and purification studies. Two different insect cell lines, SF9 and High Five (Trichoplusia ni), were used for the evaluation of protein levels. Different multiplicities of infection were used, and the extracts were evaluated at 48 h post-infection for DNMT1 expression using poly(dI-dC)·poly(dI-dC) as substrate. High Five cells have been reported to express between 5- and 10-fold higher protein levels than SF9 cells (35Davis T.R. Trotter K.M. Granados R.R. Wood H.A. Bio/Technology. 1992; 10: 1148-1150Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), but for human DNMT1 the protein expression did not improve (data not shown). All further experiments used the SF9 cell line for expression. To follow expression and find optimal conditions for production, extracts of the human DNMT1 clones were assayed by Western blots using anti-intein antibody. The optimal expression of the enzyme was 48 h post-infection (Fig.1 D), and the human DNMT1-specific band starts decreasing after 54 h post-infection infection (data not shown). Mouse DNMT1 is highly unstable and susceptible to proteolysis (13Bestor T. Laudano A. Mattaliano R. Ingram V. J. Mol. Biol. 1988; 203: 971-983Crossref PubMed Scopus (700) Google Scholar). The protease-susceptible domains in mouse and human DNMT1 are similar (14Yen R.W. Vertino P.M. Yu B.D. Nelkin J.J. El-Deiry W. Cumaraswamy A. Lennon G.G. Trask B.J. Celano P. Baylin S.B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 2287-2291Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). To minimize degradation, all steps of the purification were carried out at 4 °C using buffers containing a mixture of protease inhibitors supplemented with additional E64, a strong inhibitor of the cysteine protease, which is abundant in insect cells. During sonication, the presence of 500 mm NaCl ensures that most of the enzyme, which is normally tightly bound to DNA, remains soluble (36Turnbull J.F. Adams R.L.P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1976; 3: 677-695Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Most of the enzyme was bound to the chitin-bead affinity matrix. Overnight incubation at 4 °C with 50 mm DTT induced cleavage on the column and released most (>90%) of the full-length recombinant human DNMT1 (Fig. 2). This method yielded protein that was at least 95% pure as determined by SDS-PAGE on a 4–20% Tris/glycine gradient gel and Coomassie staining (Fig. 2). The dialyzed protein was stored at −20 °C for 4 weeks with little loss of activity. However, significant loss of activity appeared upon prolonged storage (>6 weeks) at either −20 or −80 °C. Historically, poly(dI-dC)·poly(dI-dC) has been used to define the biochemical properties of mammalian m5C MTases (36Turnbull J.F. Adams R.L.P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1976; 3: 677-695Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 37Carotti D. Palitti F. Mastrantonio S. Rispoli M. Strom R. Amato A. Campagnari F. Whitehead E.P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1986; 866: 135-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Each molecule of poly(dI-dC)·poly(dI-dC) provides a large number of potential (CI) dinucleotide sites for methylation. It has also been claimed that this polymer can undergo methylation at rates comparable to a hemimethylated DNA substrate (38Xu G. Flynn J. Glickman J.F. Reich N.O. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 207: 544-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Thus, we used this substrate to define the biochemical properties of the recombinant human DNMT1. The time course of methylation for poly(dI-dC)·poly(dI-dC) was examined at constant DNA and enzyme concentrations. The reaction was found to be linear for the first 30 min (Fig. 3 A), during which time each enzyme molecule undergoes several rounds of catalysis. This is evident from the fact that 1 nmol of human DNMT1 incorporated several nanomoles of methyl groups onto the substrate DNA (Fig. 3, A and B). Similar reactions were carried out with fixed concentrations of DNA and AdoMet but variable amounts of enzyme. The rate of methylation was linear at enzyme concentrations between 1 and 4 nm (Fig. 3 B). The resulting curves (Fig. 3, A and B) were used to determine the optimal enzyme and substrate concentrations under which linear methylation reaction was obtained. Based on the above observations, a series of double-reciprocal plots was made at six different AdoMet concentrations or six different CI (DNA) concentrations, with poly(dI-dC)·poly(dI-dC) having an average length of 7000 bp.

We have investigated the role of organic osmolytes as chemical chaperones in the amyloid pathway using glycerol to mimic the effects of naturally occurring molecules. Osmolytes such as the naturally occurring trimethylamine N-oxide and glycerol correct folding defects by preferentially hydrating partially denatured proteins and entropically stabilize native conformations and polymeric states. Trimethylamine N-oxide and glycerol were found to rapidly accelerate the Aβ random coil-to-β-sheet conformational change necessary for fiber formation. This was accompanied by an immediate conversion of amorphous unstructured aggregates into uniform globular and possibly nucleating structures. Osmolyte-facilitated changes in Aβ hydration also affected the final stages of amyloid formation and mediated transition from the protofibrils to mature fibers that are observed in vivo.

Ultrastructurally, plaques are fibrous masses composed primarily of the 40–42-residue amyloid-β (Aβ)1 peptide. Aβ is derived by endoproteolysis of the integral membrane amyloid precursor protein that results in secretion of the peptide by normal cellular pathways as well as intracellular accumulation. Under pathogenic conditions, Aβ self-associates into a well defined supramolecular fibril with high β-sheet content (3Inouye H. Fraser P.E. Kirschner D.A. Biophys. J. 1993; 64: 502-519Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). Aβ polymerization is considered to be a two-stage process initiated by the association of individual Aβ monomers into small nucleating “seeds” that is accompanied by a transition from a predominately random coil to an amyloidogenic β-sheet conformation (4Jarrett J.T.

Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 1031-1039Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar), which is the quality control site for protein folding, has prompted us to investigate the role of chemical chaperones in the Aβ folding pathway. Under stress conditions or exposure to denaturants, heat shock proteins and chemical chaperones assist in stabilizing correctly folded proteins. Through a process known as osmotic remediation (16Burg M.B. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 268: 983-996Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), chemical chaperones or organic osmolytes, including carbohydrates, free amino acids, or methylamines (e.g. trimethylamineN-oxide (TMAO)), effectively control protein folding through a preferential hydration of exposed polypeptide backbone and side chains of partially unfolded structures (17Wang A. Bolen D.W. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 9101-9108Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar). Chemical agents such as glycerol and polyethylene glycol mimic these hydration effects, which creates a thermodynamically unstable state due to the unfavorable entropic changes associated with the increased ordering of bound water molecules (18Timasheff S.N. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 1993; 22: 67-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (976) Google Scholar). This can be rectified by folding of the protein into its native conformation, which sequesters the exposed groups and excludes the osmolytes from the protein domain. As a result, the free energy of the native conformation is substantially lower than the unfolded state, which is demonstrated by the ability of glycerol to correct misfolded proteins within the endoplasmic reticulum (19Brown C.R. Hong-Brown L.Q. Welch W.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 1432-1444Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Hydration effects are equally important in protein polymerization where osmolytes are excluded through increased protein-protein interactions and can, for example, enhance the assembly and stability of microtubules (20Sackett D.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: R669-R676PubMed Google Scholar). The preferential assembly of protein polymer subunits such as Aβ and tubulin is a product of their unique structure, which results in the fibrous aggregate being the lowest energy conformer. Our findings indicate that similar forces contribute to the initiation of the Aβ random coil-to-β-sheet transition and stabilization of the resulting aggregates. These observations suggest that chemical chaperones may be useful in modeling amyloid plaque formation and may have some bearing on the cellular events involved in fibril formation. Amyloid-β peptide residues 1–40 (Aβ40) was synthesized and purified as described previously (21McLaurin J. Franklin T. Chakrabartty A. Fraser P.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 278: 183-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Peptides were examined immediately following dissolution in aqueous buffer and following prolonged incubation at high concentration to promote small protofibrillar β-sheet aggregates. Aβ40 was labeled for fluorescence studies usingN,N′-dimethyl-N-(iodoacetyl)-N′-(7-nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazol-4-yl)ethylenediamine (Molecular Probes, Inc.) as described (22Huang T.H.J. Fraser P.E. Chakarbartty A. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 269: 214-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar).N′-(7-Nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazol-4-yl)ethylenediamine (NBD)-labeled peptide was purified by gel filtration chromatography and disaggregated in 10% hexafluoro-2-propanol, and stock solutions were stored at −20 °C. The effects of TMAO (Sigma) and glycerol (BDH) on Aβ conformation were determined by CD. Peptides were dissolved to a final concentration of 50 μm in distilled water or 10 mm phosphate buffer (pH 7). Peptide solutions were combined with the TMAO at concentrations ranging from 50 to 150 μm and with glycerol ranging from 1.2 to 6m (10–50% by volume). Spectra were collected following a 10-min equilibration period and after 48–72 h of incubation at room temperature. Spectra were acquired on a Jasco Model J-715 spectropolarimeter in a 0.1-cm path length cell over a wavelength range of 190–250 nm with a 1.0-nm bandwidth, 0.1-nm resolution, 1-s response time, and 20 nm/min scan rate. All spectra were corrected by subtraction of any contributions from buffer, glycerol, TMAO or polyethylene glycol. Aβ aggregates were examined by phosphotungstic acid negative staining and platinum/carbon shadowing techniques as described previously (17Wang A. Bolen D.W. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 9101-9108Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar). For shadowing studies, the samples were atomized onto freshly cleaved mica, immediately plunged into liquid nitrogen, and lyophilized to eliminate drying artifacts that could be caused by changes in peptide concentration. Dried preparations were platinum-coated in an Edwards E12E4 coater and viewed on a Hitachi H-7000 electron microscope operated with an accelerating voltage of 75 kV. For tapping mode atomic force microscopy (TMAFM) studies, the peptides were dissolved in 25 mm phosphate buffer (pH 7) and then adjusted to the desired TMAO or glycerol content to a final peptide concentration of 2.5 μm. Approximately 10 μl of the peptide solution was transferred to a piece of freshly cleaved mica glued to a steel AFM sample mount. The sample was then immediately sealed in the TMAFM liquid cell, and the cell was filled with buffer solution. TMAFM imaging was conducted at room temperature using a combination contact/tapping mode liquid cell fitted to a Digital Instruments Nanoscope IIIA MultiMode scanning probe microscope. All images were acquired using 120-μm oxide-sharpened silicon nitride V-shaped cantilevers (type DNP-S, Digital Instruments Inc., Santa Barbara, CA) at a scan rate of ∼2 Hz and a sampling rate of 256 or 512 points/scan line. Prior to use, the AFM tips were exposed to UV irradiation to remove adventitious organic contaminants from the tip surface. While a priori determination of the appropriate drive frequency is difficult owing to viscous coupling between the cantilever and the fluid medium, which gives rise to multiple broad resonance peaks, optimal imaging was achieved at a cantilever drive frequency of ∼8.9 kHz. The aggregation state of Aβ under the various solvent conditions was examined by high speed centrifugation and assay of the soluble material using the fluorescent labeled peptide as indicator. Solutions containing 0.1 μmNBD-labeled Aβ40 and 10 μm unlabeled peptide were combined in 25 mm phosphate buffer (pH 7) containing from 0 to 6.0 m glycerol. NBD-labeled Aβ40 fluorescence spectra were acquired; the samples were centrifuged in a Beckman Airfuge at maximum velocity (135,000 × g) for 30 min; and the fluorescence spectra of the supernatants were measured. Spectra of control samples containing only Aβ40 were collected and subtracted from the NBD-labeled Aβ40 fluorescence to correct for the effects of light scattering. Steady-state fluorescence was measured at room temperature using a Photon Technology International QM-1 fluorescence spectrophotometer equipped with excitation intensity correction. Emission spectra from 500 to 600 nm were collected (λex = 478 nm, 0.1 s/nm, 8-nm band pass for excitation and emission) using a 0.2 × 1-cm path length, 0.5-ml cuvette. To determine the effects of glycerol on the fluorescent probe, unconjugated NBD at 0.1 μm was measured under comparable conditions. Circular dichroism was used to evaluate the effects of the naturally occurring osmolyte TMAO and glycerol on Aβ conformation. When dissolved in aqueous buffers, Aβ40 initially exhibits a random coil conformation indicative of an unordered structure (Fig.1 A). Consistent with previous reports, the conformational changes of Aβ from random coil to β-sheet (21McLaurin J. Franklin T. Chakrabartty A. Fraser P.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 278: 183-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) and subsequent fibril formation (23Harper J.D. Lieber C.M. Lansbury Jr., P.T. Chem. Biol. 1997; 4: 951-959Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar) can take from hours to days depending on the particular peptide batch and incubation conditions. In contrast, adjusting the solution to 1.2 mglycerol (10%, v/v) resulted in an immediate folding of the peptide into the amyloid-associated β-conformer. Increasing the glycerol level to 3 or 6 m (25–50%, v/v) produced a linear increase in the β-sheet content as measured by the minima intensity at 218 nm (Fig. 1 A). These effects were not due to increased peptide concentration caused by immiscibility in glycerol since CD studies conducted in which Aβ concentrations were doubled (from 50 to 100 μm) to replicate the 50% glycerol conditions revealed no change in the random coil structure of Aβ40 (data not shown). A similar change was observed for Aβ40 that had been preincubated to form β-sheet aggregates, which represent the early stages of fibril formation. In this case, elevating glycerol concentrations proportionally increased the preexisting β-sheet content, but to a slightly lesser quantitative degree as compared with the random coil-to-β-sheet conformational change (Fig.1 B). Identical results were obtained under all conditions in the presence of a low molecular mass (400 Da) polyethylene glycol at varying concentrations (data not shown). These results indicate that changes in protein hydration by chemical chaperones rapidly accelerate the conformational transition required for amyloid formation. Glycerol is a nonphysiological model of osmolyte activity, and we therefore investigated the effect of TMAO, which is found in vivo and acts to maintain correctly folded proteins in several species (17Wang A. Bolen D.W. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 9101-9108Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar). TMAO produced a similar random coil-to-β-sheet transition as that seen with glycerol, but at significantly lower concentrations of 50–150 μm (corresponding to molar ratios of 1:1 and 1:3 peptide/TMAO) (Fig.2 A). Similar to glycerol, TMAO increased the quantity of the β-conformation with the preincubated peptide, which initially displayed a folded and aggregated structure (data not shown). The increases in β-sheet conformation by both TMAO and glycerol were found to be roughly linear as determined by the absorption at 218 nm (Fig. 2 B). However, at the higher concentrations of TMAO, the proportion of the β-conformation appeared to be approaching a plateau. These findings suggest that TMAO is a more active compound in controlling the folding and aggregation state of Aβ, which may reflect a more potent effect of this osmolyte in anin vivo setting. The morphological changes associated with the β-sheet conformation were assessed by TMAFM performed directly in aqueous buffer. TMAFM of Aβ in the absence of the chemical chaperones revealed irregular aggregate rafts with an approximate thickness of 10 nm (Fig.3 A). The presence of aggregates was unexpected since it is generally assumed that the random coil conformation corresponds to a fully solvated and soluble Aβ monomer. Since the samples were not pretreated to remove small peptide aggregates (e.g. submicron filtration), these minor components could be present and serve as nuclei for nonspecific precipitation. Alternatively, the amorphous deposits may be due to adsorption of Aβ to the mica substrate used for TMAFM. The addition of either TMAO or glycerol at concentrations that produced the random coil-to-β-sheet transition, as confirmed by CD, resulted in a complete conversion of the amorphous Aβ aggregates to a mixture of protofibrils and small ellipsoidal particles (Fig. 3, B andC). The protofibrils varied in length and displayed a globular axial periodicity of ∼100 Å that was comparable to their average diameter. These were morphologically similar to previously reported protofibrils (7Harper J.D. Wong S.S. Lieber C.M. Lansbury P.T. Chem. Biol. 1997; 4: 119-125Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (626) Google Scholar, 8Walsh D.M. Lomakin A. Benedek G.B. Condron M.M. Teplow D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22364-22372Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (948) Google Scholar). However, judging from wider field scans, the ellipsoid aggregates predominated with dimensions of 50 × 60 × 15 Å (Fig. 3 C, arrow). We noted that these dimensions are slightly overestimated due to convolution of the AFM tip shape with the aggregate shape. Given an experimentally determined volume of ∼45,500 Å3, these ellipsoid particles represent Aβ tetramers or pentamers based on a calculated volume of ∼10,000 Å3 for an Aβ (residues 1–42) molecule folded into a two-stranded β-sheet. These may represent an aggregate of the Aβ dimer that has been shown to be stable under similar aqueous conditions (24Garzon-Rodriguez W. Sepulveda-Becerra M. Milton S. Glabe C.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21037-21044Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Comparable structures have been observed by AFM (25Roher A.E. Chaney M.O. Kuo Y.M. Webster S.D. Stine W.B. Haverkamp L.J. Woods A.S. Cotter R.J. Tuohy J.M. Krafft G.A. Bonnell B.S. Emmerling M.R. J. Biol.

A. 1999; 96: 3688-3693Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar) and have been termed Aβ-derived diffusible ligands, which may represent the most neurotoxic species (27Lambert M.P. Barlow A.K. Chromy B.A. Edwards C. Freed R. Liosatos M. Morgan T.E. Rozovsky I. Trommer B. Viola K.L. Wals P. Zhang C. Finch C.E. Krafft G.A. Klein W.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 6448-6453Crossref PubMed Scopus (3129) Google Scholar). The position of these small aggregates on the amyloid pathway is presently unclear. A straightforward explanation would be that there is a linear relationship where these are the progenitors of the protofibrils that are generated by the direct polymerization of the ellipsoid aggregates. Alternatively, they may represent a side reaction with Aβ monomers shuttling between these and the protofibrils. Assembly of the nucleating aggregates to form protofibrils is considered to be the slow kinetic phase of the amyloid pathway (28Evans K.C. Berger E.P. Cho C.G. Weisgraber K.H. Lansbury Jr., P.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 763-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). This is followed by the thermodynamic phase with the transition to compacted amyloid fibrils, a process that may also be affected by osmolyte-induced hydration. Previous AFM and negative stain electron microscopy studies have defined protofibrils as truncated and highly flexible fibrillar structures that are the precursors to plaque-related fibrils (6Stine Jr., W.B. Snyder S.W. Ladror U.S. Wade W.S. Miller M.F. Perun T.J. Holzman T.F. Krafft G.A. J. Protein Chem. 1996; 15: 193-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 7Harper J.D. Wong S.S. Lieber C.M.

Chem. 1997; 272: 22364-22372Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (948) Google Scholar). Following preincubation of a concentrated Aβ40 solution, we have observed similar aggregates of similar morphology using platinum/carbon shadowing techniques (Fig.4 A). Such protofibrils ranged in length from 1 to 100 nm and were poorly contrasted, suggesting that they have a low profile. The addition of glycerol resulted in a rapid conversion to straight compacted fibrils that extended over several hundred nanometers (Fig. 4 B) and occasionally displayed helical twisting (arrowheads). Exposure to chemical chaperones such as glycerol also significantly improved the image contrast of the fibrils, presumably as a result of their compaction into more defined tubular assemblies. Although some curved protofibril-like structures remained following glycerol treatment, there was a complete conversion to the longer fibrils following several hours of incubation (data not shown). Elongation occurred at a significantly greater pace as compared with the several days required to convert Aβ protofibrils in the absence of the glycerol chaperone. To obtain a quantitative measure of aggregation under our experimental conditions, centrifugation was employed using Aβ labeled with the fluorescent probe NBD. Our previous fluorescence resonance energy transfer studies have indicated that the low concentrations of the fluorophore-labeled Aβ do not interfere with the kinetics of fibril formation or the morphology of the resulting aggregates (22Huang T.H.J. Fraser P.E. Chakarbartty A. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 269: 214-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). In the current study, similar peptide solutions containing excess unlabeled (10 μm) and NBD-labeled (0.1 μm) Aβ were used. Prior to centrifugation, the fluorescence intensity increased linearly with increasing concentrations of glycerol, with the fluorescence at 6 m glycerol being approximately twice that of the buffer-only sample (Fig. 5). This increase was due to glycerol-induced changes in the quantum yield of NBD as shown by the response of the unconjugated label under these conditions. Following centrifugation, a 97% decrease in fluorescence was observed, indicating that the peptides are almost completely aggregated. This was the case for the glycerol-containing samples as well as the initial aqueous solution, which is consistent with the amorphous aggregates observed by AFM. This is likely due to the fact that the samples were not pretreated, for example, by filtration to remove nonspecific aggregates, which would have allowed examination of the more direct conversion of soluble monomer to Aβ aggregate. However, the results presented here with untreated samples suggest that the conversion to the β-sheet particles, which are induced by solvation changes, may involve a shuttling of monomers from the unordered structure to the nucleating aggregates. An analogous situation may occur with the diffuse-to-senile plaque Aβ interconversion that is seen in vivo, and the use of chemical chaperones may be useful in modeling this aspect of the amyloid pathway. Cumulatively, these results demonstrate that changes in the solvation state of the Aβ peptide affect several aspects of the amyloidogenic pathway. In general terms, amyloid fibrils are initiated by the destabilization of a normal cellular protein that leads to a partially unfolded intermediate. This can be accelerated by point mutations, as has been shown for lysozyme (29Booth D.R. Sunde M. Bellotti V. Robinson C.V. Hutchinson W.L. Fraser P.E. Hawkins P.N. Dobson C.M. Radford S.E.

If uncorrected, the unfolded intermediate will ultimately assemble into the β-sheet aggregates that initiate fibril formation. It has been proposed that chemical chaperones may, in part, regulate amyloid formation by stabilizing the lower energy native conformer to reduce the levels of unfolded proteins that are required for the amyloidogenic pathway. This is consistent with the observation that naturally occurring organic osmolytes inhibit the conversion of the cellular prion protein (PrPC) to the protease-resistant and amyloid-forming PrPSC associated with transmissible encephalopathies (31DebBurman S.K.

Similar stabilization by glycerol of misfolded mutant transmembrane proteins within the endoplasmic reticulum has been demonstrated for the chloride transporter associated with cystic fibrosis (33Brown C.R.

Invest. 1998; 101: 2257-2267Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). Although stabilizing native conformations of larger proteins can affect amyloid formation, it is likely that Aβ does not have a conventional conformation and may therefore exist in an unfolded and possibly amorphous state. Therefore, if unchecked by cellular control elements, the peptide will gradually deposit as diffuse and eventually senile plaques. Our results indicate that solvation changes induced by chemical chaperones such as the naturally occurring TMAO and thein vitro model provided by glycerol rapidly accelerate the major steps in the amyloidogenic pathway. These include both the early nucleation and conformational events as well as the protofibril-to-fiber conversion. This may be unique to proteins that normally exist in polymeric forms as shown by chemical chaperone-mediated assembly of tubulin into microtubules and their subsequent resistance to urea denaturation (20Sackett D.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: R669-R676PubMed Google Scholar). The significance of our findings is that they reveal additional contributors to Aβ fibril formation and therefore provide an additional tool to manipulate this pathway. Such information could potentially be used to develop or accelerate cellular models of Aβ aggregation and the assessment of agents that modulate fibril formation."

However, the physical interaction between DSL proteins and Notch receptors is poorly understood. In this study, we cloned a cDNA for mouse Jagged1 (mJagged1). To identify the receptor interacting with mJagged1 and to gain insight into its binding characteristics, we established two experimental systems using fusion proteins comprising various extracellular parts of mJagged1, a “cell” binding assay and a “solid-phase” binding assay. mJagged1 physically bound to mouse Notch2 (mNotch2) on the cell surface and to a purified extracellular portion of mNotch2, respectively, in a Ca2+-dependent manner. Scatchard analysis of mJagged1 binding to BaF3 cells and to the soluble Notch2 protein demonstrated dissociation constants of 0.4 and 0.7 nm, respectively, and that the number of mJagged1-binding sites on BaF3 is 5,548 per cell. Furthermore, deletion mutant analyses showed that the DSL domain of mJagged1 is a minimal binding unit and is indispensable for binding to mNotch2. The epidermal growth factor-like repeats of mJagged1 modulate the affinity of the interaction, with the first and second repeats playing a major role. Finally, solid-phase binding assay showed that Jagged1 binds to Notch1 and Notch3 in addition to Notch2, suggesting that mJagged1 is a ligand for multiple Notch receptors.

An attractive model which ties the activated Notch and Notch ligands was recently proposed wherein the intracellular domain of Notch is processed by stimulation with a Notch ligand and translocates into the nucleus. This suggests that ligand stimulation of Notch switches on the intracellular machinery in a manner similar to that of activated Notch (34Kopan R. Schroeter E.H. Weintraub H. Nye J.S. Proc. Natl.

It has also been reported that mDelta1 and mJagged2 can inhibit myocytic differentiation of wild-type C2C12 cells (22Luo B. Aster J.C. Hasserjian R.P. Kuo F. Sklar J. Mol. Cell.

To better understand the biology of the Notch system in mammals, further investigation of the interaction between DSL ligands and Notch receptors is required. The only information obtained to date has come from Drosophila cell-aggregation assay (38Fehon R.G. Kooh P.J. Rebay I. Regan C.L. Xu T. Muskavitch M.A. Artavanis-Tsakonas S. Cell. 1990; 61: 523-534Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar, 39Rebay I. Fleming R.J. Fehon R.G. Cherbas L. Cherbas P. Artavanis T.S. Cell. 1991; 67: 687-699Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (601) Google Scholar). A better quantitative approach to the assessment of ligand-receptor association is required. In the present study, we isolated a cDNA encoding the mouse homologue of Jagged1 (mJagged1) and obtained various forms of this protein containing an extracellular region. Two methods were developed to characterize molecules interacting with mJagged1 and their binding features, a “cell” binding assay using intact cells and a “solid-phase” binding assay using purified proteins immobilized to a plastic tray. These systems provided important information on the interaction between mJagged1 and the Notch receptors. A probe to screen a cDNA library by low-stringency hybridization was obtained by polymerase chain reaction using degenerate oligonucleotide primers and mouse embryo cDNA as a template. The primers were synthesized based on the peptide sequences FCRPRDD (amino acid (aa) 199–205) and PWQCLCE (aa 279–285), corresponding to the DSL domain and second EGF-like repeat of mDelta1 (19Bettenhausen B. Hrabe de Angelis M. Simon D. Guenet J.L. Gossler A. Development. 1995; 121: 2407-2418Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), respectively. Amplified fragments of around 260 bp were subcloned into a TA-cloning vector. Sequencing of these the inserts revealed the amplification of three kinds of cDNA. The inserts were mixed and used as a probe. Northern blot analysis ofNotch mRNA was done using the 588-bp 5′EcoRV-HindIII fragment and 532-bp SacI fragment, corresponding to similar intracellular domains of mouse Notch1 (mNotch1) (6Ellisen L.W. Bird J. West D.C. Soreng A.L. Reynolds T.C. Smith S.D. Sklar J. Cell. 1991; 66: 649-661Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1446) Google Scholar) and mNotch2, respectively. Mouse Notch2sequence data is from GenBank under accession number D32210. The 660-bp fragment at the 5′ end of a newly obtained mJagged1 cDNA was used as a probe to detect Jagged1 mRNA in mouse tissues. Each probe was 32P-labeled with the MegaprimeTM DNA labeling system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) according to the manufacturer's instructions. A mouse cDNA library in λ gt11 made from an 11-day postcoitum embryo (CLONTECH) was plated out at 5 × 104 plaque forming units on Luria broth/Mg2+agar according to the manufacturer's instructions. Following incubation for 6 h, plaques were transferred to a nylon membrane (Hybond-N, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), denatured, neutralized, and hybridized at 42 °C in a solution containing 5 × SSC, 1% SDS, 5 × Denhardt's solution, and 30% formamide. Following hybridization, filters were washed three times with 2 × SSC, 1% SDS for 15 min each. Positive clones were isolated through a second and third cycle of hybridization under the same conditions. The cDNA inserts in the isolated clones, DSL20-1 and DSL47-1, which harbored a novel sequence, were subcloned into the EcoRI site of the pBluescript SK-vector (pBS, Toyobo). The 500-bp ApaI fragment in DSL47-1 was replaced with the 1400-bp ApaI fragment from DSL20-1 (Fig. 1 A) and the resulting plasmid (pBS-20/47) used to sequence the 4.2-kb cDNA clone by a dye-terminator sequencing method with appropriate internal primers according to the manufacturer's instructions (ABI). Mouse Notch1 cDNA was the kind gift of Dr. Jeffrey S. Nye. The entire coding region ofmNotch2 was obtained by assembling library isolated clones and a 5′-rapid amplification of cDNA end clone. The extracellular portion of mNotch3 cDNA was originally obtained by polymerase chain reaction using an 11-day postcoitum mouse embryo cDNA library (CLONTECH) as a template. The sequence of the polymerase chain reaction-derived regions ofmNotch2 and mNotch3 was verified by a dye-terminator sequencing method with appropriate internal primers according to the manufacturer's instructions (ABI). A cDNA for the Fc portion of hIgG (hIgG Fc) (40Liu Y.C. Kawagishi M. Mikayama T. Inagaki Y. Takeuchi T. Ohashi H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8957-8961Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) and a Flag(His)6 sequence (5′-GACTACAAAGACGATGACGATAAACATCACCATCACCATCACTAG-3′) were fused in-frame to the 3′ end of the cDNAs encoding each partial extracellular region of mNotch1, mNotch2, and mNotch3, in expression vectors pTraserCMV (CLONTECH) and pME18S, respectively (41Takebe Y. Seiki M. Fujisawa J. Hoy P. Yokota K. Arai K. Yoshida M. Arai N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 466-472Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The mNotch1, mNotch2, and mNotch3 cDNAs were truncated at the codon GAA corresponding to glutamic acid (606th aa for soluble Notch1-Fc (sN1-Fc), 610th aa for sN2-Fc and sN2-Flag(His)6, and 586th aa for sN3-Fc). The mJagged1 cDNA was truncated at the codon GAT corresponding to aspartic acid (1067th aa for FE-J1-Fc (for full-lengthextracellular Jagged1) and ΔDSL-J1 (for the entire extracellular domain lacking only the DSL domain)); GAT corresponding to aspartic acid (296th aa for EGF1, 2-J1 (for the N terminus through the second EGF-like repeat)); and GCT corresponding to alanine (232th aa for DSL-J1 (for the N-terminal region including the DSL domain but lacking all the EGF-like repeats and cysteine-rich region)). For ΔDSL-J1, the sequence between nucleotide numbers 821 and 964 corresponding to amino acids 185 through 229 was deleted. These extracellular portions of mJagged1 were again tagged with Flag(His)6 (FE-J1-Flag(His)6) or hIgG Fc (FE-J1-Fc, ΔDSL-J1-Fc, EGF1, 2-J1-Fc, and DSL-J1-Fc) For Western blot analysis and cell binding assay using the Flag(His)6-tagged proteins, an anti-Flag monoclonal antibody (M2, Eastman Kodak) was used at a dilution of 1:1500. A PE-conjugated anti-mouse secondary antibody (Dako) was then used at a dilution of 1:200. For cell binding assay using the Fc-fused proteins, a PE-conjugated anti-human Fc antibody (Chimicon) was used at a dilution of 1:200. For Western blot analysis and cell-binding and solid-phase binding assays for the Fc-fused proteins, a horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated anti-human Fc antibody (Dako) was used at a dilution of 1:5000. A rabbit polyclonal antibody was raised against the intracellular domain of Notch2 fused in-frame to glutathioneS-transferase and used at a dilution of 1:1000 for immunoprecipitation. For Western blot analysis of Notch2, an anti-Notch2 monoclonal antibody (bhN6) (gift from Dr. Spyros Artavanis-Tsakonas) (42Zagouras P. Stifani S. Blaumueller C.M. Carcangiu M.L. Artavanis T.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 6414-6418Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar) was used at a dilution of 1:20. 32D and BaF3 were maintained in RPMI medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 0.5 ng/ml recombinant mouse interleukin-3 (gift from Kirin Brewery, Japan). COS1 were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% FBS. CHO Ras clone-I (CHO(r)) (43Ohashi H. Sudo T. Biosci. Biotechnol. Biochem. 1994; 58: 758-759Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar) (gift from Dr. S. Shirahata) were maintained in α-minimal essential medium containing 10% FBS. To establish stable CHO(r) cells expressing soluble Notch receptors and various forms of soluble Jagged1, 5 μg of the pTraserCMV plasmid containing cDNAs for these proteins was transfected into CHO(r) cells by the liposome method (TransIT-1, Takara). After 2 days, cell selection was started in the presence of 250 μg/ml Zeocin (Life Technologies, Inc.). Expression of the soluble protein produced by each Zeocin-resistant cell line was evaluated by Western blot analysis using an anti-Flag antibody or an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay using an antibody against the hIgG Fc. The clone showing the highest expression level was chosen for each protein. Stable CHO(r) cells expressing each soluble Notch receptor or soluble Jagged1 at the highest level were plated in a 15-cm (diameter) dish at a total of 5 × 106 cells and incubated overnight. The cells were washed the following day with phosphate-buffered saline and cultured in 40 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's/Ham's F-12 medium for 5 days. The supernatants were then collected and concentrated through a DIALO membrane (Amicon). Each soluble protein was purified from the concentrated supernatant using Protein G Fast Flow (Protein G, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) or Ni-bound beads (ProbondTM, Invitrogen) according to the manufacturers' instructions. A transient expression system was used to obtain deletion mutants of soluble mJagged1 protein: the pME18S plasmid containing a cDNA for deletion mutant of the soluble Jagged1-Fc protein was transfected into COS1 cells by a DEAE-dextran method (44Katakura Y. Seto P. Ohashi H. Teruya K. Shirahata S. Cytotechnology. 1999; 31 (in press)Crossref Google Scholar) or a TransIT-1-based liposome method. The approximate concentration of each fusion protein in conditioned medium was estimated by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay detecting the hIgG Fc. Cell binding assays were done using FACS and colorimetric methods. For FACS analysis, log phase-grown 32D and BaF3 cells were washed in phosphate-buffered saline and aliquoted at 3 × 105 cells in 200 μl of binding buffer (phosphate-buffered saline containing 2% FBS, 100 μg/ml CaCl2, and 0.05% NaN3). After blocking with 5 μl of rabbit serum, the cells were incubated in cell-binding buffer containing the Fc- or Flag(His)6-tagged soluble mJagged1 proteins at room temperature for 1 h. After washing three times with the binding buffer, the cells were incubated with a PE-conjugated anti-hIgG antibody (for Fc-fused proteins) or an anti-Flag antibody, M2, followed by staining with a PE-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (for the Flag(His)6 proteins). The cells were then analyzed using a FACS Calibur (Becton Dickinson Immunocytometry Systems). A colorimetric method was adopted for the cell binding assay to determine the affinity of mJagged1 to the surface of BaF3. In this method, a binding procedure similar to those above was performed using 0.1% bovine serum albumin instead of 2% FBS in the blocking buffer and a HRP-conjugated anti-hIgG instead of a PE-conjugated antibody as second antibody. The amount of bound FE-J1-Fc was estimated by measuring cell-bound HRP activity using a HRP development reagent (Sumilon). To determine the absolute molar value of incubated and bound FE-J1-Fc, the optical density (OD) value given by the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for a concentration-defined hIgG (Xymed) was utilized. The intensity of color was then measured using a microplate reader (MR700; Dynatech Laboratories). Poly(A)+ RNA was isolated using the Poly(A)TtractTM mRNA isolation system (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Two micrograms of mRNA from different adult mouse tissues was separated in a 1.2% agarose-formamide gel, transferred to a nylon membrane (Hybond-N, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and UV cross-linked. The 5′-end 660-bp fragment of mJagged1 was radiolabeled by a random priming method and used as a probe. Hybridization was carried out for 24 h at 42 °C in 50% formamide, 5 × SSPE, 5 × Denhardt's solution, 1% SDS, and 0.1 mg/ml salmon sperm DNA. The membrane was subjected to stringent washing twice with 0.2 × SSC and 0.1% SDS at 65 °C for 30 min and the blot was visualized with a Fuji BioImage Analyzer BAS2000 (Fuji Film). A total of 1 × 107 32D or BaF3 cells were subjected to cell binding assay as described above with 1.7 nm FE-J1-Fc. The cells were then solubilized in a TNP buffer containing 20 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 1.0% Nonidet P-40, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, and 100 μg/ml CaCl2 for 30 min at 4 °C. The lysates were precipitated with Protein G beads which were washed four times with TNP buffer and boiled in the SDS sample buffer under reducing conditions. The samples were subjected to 7.0% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and electrophoretically transferred to a nylon membrane (Immobilon, Millipore). The membranes were blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk in TBST (20 mmTris-HCl (pH 7.4), 500 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20) for 1 h and incubated overnight at room temperature with an anti-Notch2 monoclonal antibody, bhN6. The membrane was washed three times with TBST and incubated with an alkaline phosphatase-conjugated anti-rat IgG antibody (Promega) for 1 h. Following three washes with TBST, the membrane was visualized using BCNP and nitro blue tetrazolium (Promega). Two hundred nanograms of purified FE-J1-Flag(His)6 or sN2-Flag(His)6 was added to the wells of a 96-well plate (Dynatech). The plate was blocked with phosphate-buffered saline containing 2.5% gelatin at room temperature for 1 h and Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing purified sN2-Fc or FE-J1-Fc was added. After 2 h incubation, the plate was washed three times with TBST containing 100 μg/ml CaCl2, followed by addition of a HRP-conjugated anti-human IgG antibody. After washing with the same buffer, the color was visualized with the HRP development reagent and the degree of binding was measured using a microplate reader. In an attempt to isolate a novel mouse Notch ligand, we screened a cDNA library constructed from an 11-day postcoitum mouse embryo using a low stringency hybridization method. The probe used was a mixture of three DSL sequences, which were obtained by polymerase chain reaction using degenerated primers and mouse embryo cDNA as a template (“Experimental Procedures”). The sequences of these fragments corresponded to the DSL region of mouse Delta1, Jagged1, and Jagged2, the latter two of which have to date only been identified in rats and humans. The nucleotide sequence of a number of cDNA clones isolated revealed that two, DSL20-1 and DSL47-1, represented partial cDNA clones encoding a mouse homologue of Jagged1 and which covered the entire coding region when combined. DSL20-1 contained the 5′ end of mJagged1 with 268-bp noncoding and 3.2-kb coding regions. DSL47-1 contained 3.6-kb coding and 160-bp 3′-end noncoding regions (Fig.1 A). The full-length mJagged1 clone contained an open reading frame of 3,654 bp, which predicted a protein consisting of 1,218 amino acids. Amino acid sequence alignment of mouse, rat, and human Jagged1 shows mJagged1 protein having overall amino acid identities with rat and human Jagged1 (rJagged1 and hJagged1) of 97 and 96%, respectively (Fig. 1 B). Amino acid conservation in the DSL and EGF-like repeat regions was high at 98 and 97%, respectively. Examination of mJagged1 expression by Northern blot analysis with mRNAs from various adult mouse tissues and a 14.5-day postcoitum embryo showed that mJagged1 was expressed in various tissues. Highest expression was in the embryo (Fig.2). Expression in adult tissues was highest in brain, heart, muscle, and thymus. An mRNA transcript of 6.5 kb was detected as a major band; tissues showing this transcript also showed two minor bands of about 4.0 and 3.6 kb. These short transcripts may be alternatively spliced forms of mJagged1 mRNA. Two kinds of soluble protein comprising the full-length extracellular region of Jagged1, one with hIgG Fc and the other with Flag(His)6 tagged to the C terminus, designated FE-J1-Fc and FE-J1-Flag(His)6, respectively, were stably produced by cDNA-transfected CHO(r) cells. Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining of Protein G-purified FE-J1-Fc and Ni-purified FE-J1-Flag(His)6 revealed that purity was over 95 and 90%, respectively (Fig. 3 A). FE-J1-Fc was found at positions of about 210 kDa under reducing and over 400 kDa under nonreducing conditions, whereas FE-J1-Flag(His)6 migrated to similar positions of about 140–180 kDa under both conditions (Fig. 3 A). This indicates that, as expected, FE-J1-Fc is dimerized at the Fc portion. We first investigated the binding of FE-J1-Fc to various cell lines by FACS analysis. FE-J1-Fc bound to all of the cell lines screened, including BaF3 (early B lineage cells), 32D (myeloid lineage cells), CTLL2 (T lineage cells), NSF60 (myeloid leukemia cells), NIH3T3 (embryonic fibroblasts), and C2C12 (myoblastic cells) (data not shown), with binding to 32D and BaF3 greater than to the other cells (Fig.3 B; other data not shown). FE-J1-Flag(His)6 also bound to these hematopoietic cells (Fig. 3 B). With regard to the characteristics of the Notch/Notch-ligand interaction, it is known that both Delta and Serrate interact with Notch in a Ca2+-dependent manner in theDrosophila cell system (39Rebay I. Fleming R.J. Fehon R.G. Cherbas L. Cherbas P. Artavanis T.S. Cell. 1991; 67: 687-699Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (601) Google Scholar). To determine whether this feature was also conserved in a mammalian system, EGTA, a Ca2+-chelating reagent, was added to the binding mixture. Binding of FE-J1-Fc and FE-J1-Flag(His)6 to either the 32D or BaF3 cells was clearly abolished by the addition of EGTA (Fig.3 B). We further found that the amount of BaF3-bound FE-J1-Fc increased in accordance with the incubation concentration of FE-J1-Fc, reaching a plateau at 1 nm (Fig. 3 C). Competition assay in the same experimental system but with an excess of purified FE-J1-Flag(His)6 added to the cell-binding mixture showed complete abrogation of FE-J1-Fc binding to 32D and BaF3 at an approximately 500-fold molar excess of FE-J1-Flag(His)6(Fig. 3 D). These results indicate that the binding observed represents specific interaction of the extracellular domain of mJagged1 with a Notch receptor on the surface of the hematopoietic cells. Determination of the dissociation constant (K d ) of mJagged1 binding to its receptor on the BaF3 cell surface was done using a colorimetric rather than FACS method. Specific colorimetric activity was calculated as 0.092 OD/fmol of hIgG or FE-J1-Fc. Re-evaluation of a saturation binding assay and associated Scatchard plot (Fig. 3 E) gave a K d value of about 0.4 nm. The number of binding sites was estimated at 5,548/BaF3 cell (Fig. 3 E). The roles of the DSL domain and EGF-like repeats in the binding capacity of Jagged1 were examined with three deletion mutants of Jagged1. We first confirmed that FE-J1-Fc derived from COS1 possessed binding activity equivalent to that derived from CHO(r) (data not shown). When COS1-derived purified FE-J1-Fc and three deletion mutants (Fig. 4, Aand B) were allowed to bind to 32D at identical molar concentrations, binding activity was greatest for FE-J1-Fc, slightly lower for EGF-1,2-J1-Fc and profoundly lower for DSL-J1-Fc (Fig.4 C). In all cases, binding activity was dependent on Ca2+ (data not shown). ΔDSL-J1-Fc did not bind at all (Fig. 4 C). Essentially identical results were obtained when the same experiment was performed using proteins tagged with Flag(His)6 instead of hIgG Fc (data not sh"

In support of the biological significance of this interaction, we found that the complex of BRCA2 and Rad51 in breast cancer MCF-7 cells was diminished upon conditional expression of a wild-type, but not a mutated, BRC4 repeat using the tetracycline-inducible system. Cells expressing a wild-type BRC4 repeat showed hypersensitivity to γ-irradiation, an inability to form Rad51 radiation-induced foci, and a failure of radiation-induced G2/M, but not G1/S, checkpoint control. These results strongly suggest that the interaction between BRCA2 and Rad51 mediated by BRC repeats is critical for the cellular response to DNA damage.

At the cellular level, expression is regulated in a cell-cycle dependent manner and peak expression of BRCA2mRNA is found in S phase (6Vaughn J.P. Cirisano F.D. Huper G. Berchuck A. Futreal P.A. Marks J.R. Iglehart J.D. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 4590-4594PubMed Google Scholar). These results suggest BRCA2 may participate in regulating cell proliferation. Recent studies indicate that BRCA2 is important for the cellular response to DNA damage. Brca2-null mouse embryos are nonviable at a very early stage of development and blastocysts derived from these embryos are very sensitive to γ-irradiation (7Sharan S.K. Morimatsu M. Albrecht U.

Mouse embryonic fibroblasts predicted to express BRCA2 that is C-terminally truncated at amino acid 1492 also demonstrated sensitivity to DNA damaging agents, particularly methyl methanesulfonate and UV light (8Patel K.J.

Furthermore, Capan-1, a human pancreatic cancer line, that expresses a 220-kDa C-terminally truncated BRCA2 protein, is hypersensitive to a panel of DNA damaging agents (9Abbott D.W. Freeman M.L. Holt J.T. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1998; 90: 978-985Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Importantly, ectopic expression of wild-type, but not mutated, BRCA2 in Capan-1 cells restores resistance to treatment with MMS (10Chen P.L. Chen C.F. Chen Y. Xiao J. Sharp Z.D. Lee W.H. Proc. Natl.

While an association between BRCA2 and Rad51 is well documented, there is, nonetheless, some discrepancy concerning the regions of BRCA2 that bind to Rad51. It was reported that the C-terminal region of mouse Brca2 binds to mouse Rad51 (7Sharan S.K. Morimatsu M. Albrecht U. Lim D.S. Regel E. Dinh C. Sands A. Eichele G. Hasty P. Bradley A.

By contrast, we and others have previously shown that the BRC repeats located in exon 11 (amino acid 1009–2083) of human BRCA2 bind to Rad51 (10Chen P.L. Chen C.F. Chen Y. Xiao J. Sharp Z.D. Lee W.H.

BRC1, BRC2, BRC3, BRC4, BRC7, and BRC8 are highly conserved and bind to Rad51, whereas BRC5 and BRC6 are less well conserved and do not bind to Rad51 (10Chen P.L. Chen C.F. Chen Y. Xiao J. Sharp Z.D.

Whether the interaction between BRCA2 and Rad51 has biological significance remains completely unknown. In an effort to investigate this issue, we have used the tetracycline binary gene control system for conditional expression of a BRC4 repeat in breast cancer MCF-7 cells. In this communication, we have found that upon expression of a wild-type, but not a mutated, BRC4 repeat, the interaction between BRCA2 and Rad51 was reduced. Cells expressing a wild-type BRC4 repeat showed hypersensitivity to γ-irradiation, an inability to form radiation-induced Rad51 nuclear foci, and a failure of radiation-induced G2/M checkpoint control. These results strongly suggest that the BRC repeats of BRCA2 are important for mediating the cellular response to DNA damage. The 39-amino acid BRC1 repeat (residue 1003–1042 of BRCA2) (2Tavtigian S.V. Simard J. Rommens J. Couch F. Shattuck-Eidens D. Neuhausen S. Merajver S. Thorlacius S. Offit K. Stoppa-Lyonnet D.

Deoxynucleotide triphosphates used in PCR reaction were 10 mm dGTP, dCTP, dTTP, and 2 mm dATP. The resulting PCR fragments were digested with NcoI andXhoI and cloned into pAS1 vector (22Durfee T. Becherer K. Chen P.-L. Yeh S.-H. Yang Y. Kilburn A.E. Lee W.-H. Elledge S.J. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 555-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (1299) Google Scholar) to generate a BRC1 mutant library (pAS1/BRC1-ML). These plasmid DNAs were transformed along with pGAD-Rad51 into the yeast Mav203 strain (MATα, leu2–3, 112, trp1–901, his3d200, ade2–101, gal4d, gal80d, SPAL10::URA3, GAL1::lacZ, HIS3UAS GAL1::[email protected] can1R, cyh2R) and selected for 5-fluoroorotic acid-resistant colonies (23Vidal M.

The recovered pAS1/BRC DNAs were further sequenced to determine the mutations. β-Galactosidase activities (U) was measured using chlorophenyl-red-β-d-galactopyranoside as substrate for interactions in the yeast two-hybrid system as described (22Durfee T.

To generate cell clones that express a GFP-BRC4 fusion protein, we employed the tetracycline-inducible expression system controlled by a tet-responsive promoter (24Gossen M. Bujard H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5547-5551Crossref PubMed Scopus (4256) Google Scholar). A pUHD10-3-based plasmid was used to construct pUHD10-3/GFP-BRC plasmids that will express chimeric proteins containing GFP with a nuclear localization signal and a myc epitope fused to either a wild-type BRC4 or a mutated BRC4-M5. These two plasmids were separately co-transfected into MCF-7 cells with the second plasmid, pCHTV, which contains a hygromycin resistance gene and a cytomegalovirus-controlled tetracycline repressor-VP16 fusion transcription unit. Cell clones resistant to hygromycin were subsequently isolated and several of them were shown to express the wild-type or mutant GFP-BRC4 upon removal of tetracycline. The expression of GFP-BRC4 was further confirmed by immunoprecipitation with α-myc 9E10 monoclonal antibody (25Evan G.I. Lewis G.K. Ramsay G. Bishop J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1985; 5: 3610-3616Crossref PubMed Scopus (2167) Google Scholar) and immunoblotting analysis with a monoclonal α-GFP antibody (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA). Two stable lines of MCF-7 cells, WT-8 and MT-11, that conditionally express wild-type BRC4 and BRC4-M5 mutant, respectively, were established. Immunoprecipitations were performed as described previously (10Chen P.L. Chen C.F. Chen Y. Xiao J. Sharp Z.D. Lee W.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Bishop J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1985; 5: 3610-3616Crossref PubMed Scopus (2167) Google Scholar) were used for the immunoblotting analysis according to standard procedure (10Chen P.L. Chen C.F. Chen Y. Xiao J. Sharp Z.D. Lee W.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 5287-5292Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). Procedures for immunostaining were adapted from Zhong et al. (26Zhong Q.

Briefly, cells in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with or without tetracycline (1 μg/ml) grown on coverslips to 60–70% confluence were irradiated with 12 Gy using a Mark I, model 68A irradiator. After 6 h, cells were fixed in 4% formaldehyde with 0.1% Triton X-100. α-Rad51 antibody (Ab-1) diluted 1:1000 in 10% goat serum was added onto the cells and then visualized with goat anti-rabbit antibody conjugated to Texas Red. Cells were further stained with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) and mounted in Permafluor (Lipshaw-Immunonon, Pittsburgh, PA). Rad51 foci-positive cells were counted and recorded using a standard fluorescence microscope. Cells (WT-8 and MT-11) were seeded in identical plates at 5000 cells/plate in medium with tetracycline (1 μg/ml). Expression of the wild-type or mutant GFP-BRC4 repeat was induced by removing tetracycline 24 h after seeding. Twenty four hours after induction of GFP-BRC4 expression, cells were then γ-irradiated with 3 Gy. After incubation for 14 days, cells were fixed and stained with 2% methylene blue in 50% of ethanol for colony counting. Averages and standard deviations were determined from eight plates. Statistical analyses were performed with the programs InStat and InPlot (GraphPad Inc., San Diego, CA). The G1/S checkpoint was determined according to the procedures described (27Kuerbitz S.J. Plunkett B.S. Walsh W.V. Kastan M.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 7491-7495Crossref PubMed Scopus (1845) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells in logarithmic growth were mock-exposed or γ-irradiated (12 Gy). After 24 h, cells were labeled with 10 μm BrdUrd for 4 h and fixed for BrdUrd staining using a Cell Proliferation Kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). BrdUrd-positive cells were quantified, and expressed as a fraction of the total cells. For the G2/M checkpoint, cells were irradiated to 3 Gy, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde at indicated time and stained with DAPI for counting mitotic cells in prophase, metaphase, anaphase, and telophase (28Xu X. Weaver Z. Linke S.P. Li C. Gotay J. Wang X.W. Harris C.C. Ried T. Deng C.X. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 389-395Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (702) Google Scholar). Alternately, cells were irradiated with 4–16 Gy and processed for analysis of mitotic cells after 1 h. To systematically address the biological consequence of the interaction between BRCA2 and Rad51, amino acid residues of the first BRC repeat, BRC1, that are critical for Rad51-binding were first examined. BRC1 was subjected to biased PCR mutagenesis (21Shan B. Durfee T. Lee W.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 679-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), and the mutated cDNAs were translationally fused to the GAL4 DNA-binding domain in the yeast vector, pAS1 (22Durfee T. Becherer K. Chen P.-L. Yeh S.-H. Yang Y. Kilburn A.E. Lee W.-H. Elledge S.J. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 555-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (1299) Google Scholar), to generate a library of 2 × 106 individual clones referred to as pAS/BRC1-ML. A reverse two-hybrid screen with negative selection was used to isolate clones that fail to bind Rad51 as described previously (23Vidal M. Braun P. Chen E. Boeke J.D. Harlow E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 10321-10326Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Several mutations in BRC1 were identified that significantly reduced Rad51 binding in a yeast two-hybrid assay (TableI). BRC1-M1 is a mutation that changes a conserved threonine residue to alanine. BRC1-M2 and -M3 are changes in nonconsensus amino acids, and BRC1-M4 carries a double mutation at the two C-terminal BRC1 residues, the last residue of which is conserved. Interestingly, a familial mutation, G1529R, has been previously found in BRC4 (Breast Cancer Information Core). Specific Rad51 binding activity by BRC4 was also tested and found to be approximately three times stronger than BRC1 (Table I). Two BRC4 mutations, BRC4-M5, an analogous mutation to BRC1-M1, in which the conserved threonine at the third position is changed to an alanine, and BRC4-M6, which contains the G1529R mutation, were constructed and found to have reduced Rad51-binding (Table I). These results suggest that, despite their sequence conservation, the ability of BRC repeats to bind Rad51 varies, and is dependent on specific residues.Table IIdentification of mutations in the first and fourth BRC repeats of BRCA2 that disrupt binding to Rad51BRC consensusI I L DRelative β-galactosidase activityFXTASGKX X SXXXLXKXXXX XV V F EBRC1FRTASNKEIKLSEHNIKKSKMFFKD7BRC1-M1A<1BRC1-M2G<1BRC1-M3S<1BRC1-M4RG<1BRC4FHTASGKKVKIAKESLDKVKNLFDE22BRC4-M5A<1BRC4-M6R4vector1A randomly mutagenized pool of cDNAs encoding BRC1 repeats (amino acid 1003–1042) was cloned into the pAS1 vector and co-transformed along with pGAD-Rad51 into Mav203 cells.

Both of the mutations significantly reduced, but the G to R mutation did not completely eliminate, Rad51 binding in this assay. To determine the functional importance of the interactions between the BRC repeats of BRCA2 and Rad51, two stable lines of MCF-7 cells, WT-8 and MT-11, that conditionally express wild-type BRC4 and mutant BRC4-M5, respectively, were established (Fig.1 B). Tetracycline-responsive expression of the GFP-BRC4 fusion proteins in these two lines was clearly demonstrated by immunoprecipitation with α-myc antibodies and immunoblotting with α-GFP or α-Rad51 antibodies (Fig.1 C, top panel compare lanes 2 and4 with 1 and 3). Rad51 is detected in the immunoprecipitates of wild-type, but not GFP-BRC4-M5 (Fig.1 C, compare lanes 4 with 2), indicating that the GFP fusion with wild-type BRC4 binds to Rad51 in cells. Importantly, expression of wild-type, but not the BRC4-M5 mutant, significantly reduced BRCA2 in the Rad51 immunoprecipitates and, in the reciprocal experiment, reduced Rad51 in the BRCA2 immunoprecipitates (Fig. 1 D, compare lane 4 with lane 2). These data strongly suggest that conditional expression of a wild-type, but not a mutated, BRC4 repeat effectively disrupts the interaction between BRCA2 and Rad51. The important role of Rad51 in recombinational DNA double-strand break repair (13Shinohara A. Ogawa H. Ogawa T. Cell. 1992; 69: 457-470Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1052) Google Scholar) suggests that disruption of the interaction between BRCA2 and Rad51 may have an adverse effect on the ability of cells to respond to DNA damage. To test this possibility, both WT-8 and MT-11 cells cultured either with or without tetracycline, were mock-exposed or γ-irradiated (3 Gy), and cell survival was determined by clonogenic assay. Induction of the expression of a wild-type BRC4 repeat (WT-8, −Tet) significantly reduced cell survival rate when compared with the uninduced (WT-8, +-Tet) or to either the induced (MT-11, −Tet) or uninduced (MT-11, +Tet) mutant BRC4 (p < 0.0001) (Table II).Table IIClonogenicity of WT-8 and MT-11 cells after γ-irradiation0 Gy3 GySurvival rate, mean ± S.D.

Survival rates by colony formation (>50 cells/colony) were determined by counting the number of colonies per plate. Averages and S.D. were calculated from eight plates. Survival rates were calculated by dividing the number of colonies in the mock-exposed control by the number from exposed cells. Note that the expression of wild-type, but not mutated BRC4 repeat, significantly reduced cell survival in this assay (p < 0.0001).

Note that the expression of wild-type, but not mutated BRC4 repeat, significantly reduced cell survival in this assay (p < 0.0001). To further explore DNA damage response phenotypes of these two cell lines, the appearance of radiation-induced Rad51-containing foci was examined. Under uninduced conditions (+Tet), both clonal lines formed Rad51 foci after γ-irradiation (Fig.2 A). However, WT-8 cells induced to express a wild-type GFP-BRC4 repeat exhibited a reduction in the appearance of Rad51 foci compared with MT-11 cells induced to express the GFP-BRC4-M5 mutated repeat (Fig. 2 A for representative field and Fig. 2 B for quantification). These data suggest that the interaction between BRCA2 and Rad51 is crucial for the formation of Rad51 repair foci and, furthermore, that exogenous expression of BRC repeats can interfere with this activity. Increased sensitivity to ionizing radiation may result from defects in the DNA repair machinery or in the molecules essential for cell cycle checkpoint control. When normal mouse embryo fibroblasts are exposed to γ-irradiation, their transit through the cell cycle is arrested at either one of two points (27Kuerbitz S.J. Plunkett B.S. Walsh W.V. Kastan M.B.

The G2/M checkpoint prevents segregation of damaged chromosomes (33Elledge S.J. Science. 1996; 274: 1664-1672Crossref PubMed Scopus (1765) Google Scholar). To test for a potential role of BRCA2-Rad51 interactions in DNA damage-induced cell cycle checkpoint control, cells expressing the GFP-BRC4 repeat were assayed for G1/S and G2/M checkpoint integrity in response to γ-irradiation. As shown in Fig. 3 A, WT-8 and MT-11 cells, under all conditions, demonstrated nearly identical numbers of BrdUrd-incorporated cells, indicating that the expression of the BRC repeats did not significantly impair G1/S checkpoint control in response to γ-irradiation. In contrast, when cells were assayed for mitotic figures at variable times after γ-irradiation, the number of cells in mitosis was not significantly decreased in WT-8 cells induced to express a wild-type BRC4 repeat (Fig. 3 B, panel a). However, MT-11 cells induced to express a GFP-BRC4-M5 mutated repeat, as well as uninduced cells, demonstrated significant reductions in mitotic figures (Fig. 3 B, panel a). In a parallel experiment, cells were irradiated with 4–16 Gy. In the population induced to express a wild-type BRC4, the percentage of mitotic cells was significantly higher than that of cells either uninduced or induced to express mutant GFP-BRC4-M5 (Fig. 3 B, panel b). These results suggest that cellular expression of a wild-type BRC4 repeat interferes with the radiation-induced G2/M checkpoint. It was reported that mouse embryo fibroblasts, with a genotypeBrca2 tm1Cam and predicted to express a C-terminally truncated BRCA2 at amino acid 1492, have intact cell cycle checkpoint responses (8Patel K.J. Vu V.P. Lee H. Corcoran A. Thistlethwaite F.C. Evans M.J. Colledge W.H. Friedman L.S. Ponder B.A. Venkitaraman A.R. Mol.

Nature. 1997; 386: 804-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (918) Google Scholar) strongly suggests that the remaining 3 BRC repeats in the Brca2 tm1Cam truncated protein are partially functional. The functional importance of the BRC repeats is supported by our results demonstrating that the expression of GFP-BRC4 repeat in cells results in hypersensitivity to radiation and a failure in G2/M checkpoint control. The increased radiosensitivity in cells expressing the BRC4 repeat indicates that the complex of BRCA2 and Rad51 is important for the mechanics of the repair process. This notion is compatible with the known role of Rad51 in recombination repair. In this capacity, BRCA2 may facilitate Rad51 function in strand exchange by modulating formation of the Rad51-DNA nucleoprotein filament and/or pairing and strand-exchange steps of DNA double strand break repair (13Shinohara A. Ogawa H. Ogawa T. Cell. 1992; 69: 457-470Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1052) Google Scholar). The failure of radiation-induced G2/M checkpoint control in cells expressing BRC4 repeat indicates that BRCA2 may have a role in this task. It is possible that the formation of the BRCA2 and Rad51 complex could be important for radiation-induced G2/M checkpoint control. However, the BRCA2-Rad51 complex is formed independently of DNA damage (10Chen P.L. Chen C.F. Chen Y. Xiao J. Sharp Z.D. Lee W.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 5287-5292Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar, 11Mizuta R. LaSalle J.M. Cheng H.L. Shinohara A. Ogawa H. Copeland N. Jenkins N.A. Lalande M. Alt F.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Interestingly, mouse embryo fibroblasts expressing exon 11-deleted Brca1 also exhibit defects in radiation-induced G2/M checkpoint control (28Xu X. Weaver Z. Linke S.P. Li C. Gotay J. Wang X.W. Harris C.C. Ried T. Deng C.X. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 389-395Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (702) Google Scholar) and BRCA2 apparently interacts with BRCA1 (35Chen J. Silver D.P. Walpita D. Cantor S.B. Gazdar A.F. Tomlinson G. Couch F.J. Weber B.L. Ashley T. Livingston D.M. Scully R. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 317-328Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar). It is possible, therefore, that the BRCA2-Rad51 complex may interact with BRCA1 to establish G2/M checkpoint control. Alternatively, the BRC repeats may mediate separate interactions with cell cycle checkpoint proteins when induced by DNA damage signaling. Regardless of which possibility is operative in cells, the data presented here support and extend the model originally proposed (10Chen P.L. Chen C.F. Chen Y. Xiao J. Sharp Z.D. Lee W.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 5287-5292Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar), that BRC repeat interactions with Rad51 are important for the cellular DNA damage response. The observation thatmRad51 −/− mouse embryos are not viable and ES cells with the same genotype cannot survive (16Lim D.S. Hasty P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 7133-7143Crossref PubMed Scopus (626) Google Scholar, 17Tsuzuki T. Fujii Y. Sakumi K. Tominaga Y. Nakao K. Sekiguchi M. Yoshimura Y. Morita T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Cell. 1998; 1: 347-357Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar), suggests that Rad51, through interactions with BRCA2, may have functions in addition to DNA repair. Like, BRCA1, it appears that BRCA2 functions in a pathway that bifurcates into one that is important for repair of genetic lesions and another important for restraining cell division until repair is complete. It is possible that each of the BRC repeats, or certain group of the repeats, may have separate and distinct functions within each pathway. Nevertheless, the fact that expression of one BRC repeat can disrupt Rad51-BRCA2 interactions, interfere with the G2/M checkpoint, and can make cells radiation-sensitive suggests that it could be used to radiosensitize and/or chemosensitize resistant tumors.

Recently, the sterol response element-binding protein 1 (SREBP1) was implicated in the nutrient control of lipogenic gene expression. In this report, we have assessed the role SREBP1 plays in the PUFA control of three hepatic genes, fatty acid synthase, L-pyruvate kinase (LPK), and the S14 protein (S14). PUFA suppressed both the hepatic mRNASREBP1 through a PPARα-independent mechanism as well as SREBP1c nuclear content (nSREBP1c, 65 kDa). Co-transfection of primary hepatocytes revealed a differential sensitivity of the fatty acid synthase, S14, and LPK promoters to nSREBP1c overexpression. Of the three promoters examined, LPK was the least sensitive to overexpressed nSREBP1c. Promoter deletion and gel shift analyses of the S14 promoter localized a functional SREBP1c cis-regulatory element to an E-box-like sequence (−139TCGCCTGAT−131) within the S14 PUFA response region. Although overexpression of nSREBP1c significantly reduced PUFA inhibition of S14CAT, overexpression of other factors that induced S14CAT activity, such as steroid receptor co-activator 1 or retinoid X receptor α, had no effect on S14CAT PUFA sensitivity. These results suggest that PUFA regulates hepatic nSREBP1c, a factor that functionally interacts with the S14 PUFA response region.

PUFA suppression of de novo lipogenesis is due to inhibition of transcription of key genes involved in lipid synthesis, including acetyl-CoA carboxylase, fatty acid synthase, stearoyl-CoA desaturase 1, malic enzyme, and L-pyruvate kinase. Long chain n-3 fatty acids like eicosapentaenoic acid (20:5,n-3) also enhance fatty acid oxidation, decrease triglyceride synthesis, and reduce serum triglycerides. By regulating these pathways, PUFA promote a shift from fatty acid synthesis and storage to oxidation (for review see Ref. 1Jump D.B. Clarke S.D. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 1999; 19: 63-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (549) Google Scholar). The molecular basis for PUFA regulation of hepatic gene expression is complex and involves several mechanisms. For example, PPARα is a ligand-activated nuclear receptor that regulates the expression of mitochondrial, peroxisomal, and microsomal enzymes involved in fatty acid metabolism. Certain hypolipemic drugs like fenofibrate and gemfibrozil as well as fatty acids activate PPARα (2Reddy J.K. Mannaerts G.P. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 1994; 14: 343-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar). Studies using the PPARα null mouse indicate that both PPARα-dependent and PPARα-independent pathways are operative in the liver (3Ren B. Thelen A.P. Peters J.M. Gonzalez F.J. Jump D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26827-26832Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). For example, PPARα is required for n-3 PUFA activation of acyl- CoA oxidase (AOX) and cytochrome P450–4A (CPY4A) gene expression, but PPARα is not required for the PUFA-mediated suppression of lipogenic gene expression. Other studies have shown that hepatic cyclooxygenase expression is restricted to non-parenchymal cells, e.g. Kupffer and endothelial cells (4Mater M.K. Thelen A.P. Jump D.B. J. Lipid Res. 1999; 40: 1045-1052Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, hepatic parenchymal cells possess G-protein-linked receptors that respond to prostanoids like prostaglandin E2 and prostaglandin F2α. Prostaglandin E2 treatment of these cells suppresses mRNAs encoding fatty acid synthase (FAS) and the S14 protein (S14). However, n-3 and n-6 PUFA suppression of hepatic lipogenic gene expression is independent of cyclooxygenase (4Mater M.K. Thelen A.P. Jump D.B. J. Lipid Res. 1999; 40: 1045-1052Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The fact that PUFA regulation of lipogenic gene expression is independent of both cyclooxygenase and PPARα implicates other routes for control. Recent studies by Worgall et al. (5Worgall T.S. Sturley S.L. Seo T. Osborne T.F. Deckelbaum R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25537-25540Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar) provide an important clue to another factor involved in PUFA regulation of gene expression. Their studies suggest that unsaturated fatty acids regulate the nuclear abundance of the sterol response element binding protein-1 (SREBP1). Previous studies show that SREBP1 subtypes played a major role in the hormonal/nutrient control of lipogenic gene expression (6Shimano H. Horton J.D. Hammer R.E. Shimomura I. Brown M.S.

SREBPs are ∼130-kDa proteins attached to the endoplasmic reticulum and nuclear membranes through transmembrane-spanning domains. SREBP1 and SREBP2 are encoded by separate genes, and SREBP1 is expressed as two subtypes, 1a and 1c, which arise from differential promoter and exon usage (13Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Cell. 1997; 89: 331-340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3029) Google Scholar). In liver, SREBP1c is the predominant subtype, whereas SREBP1a is the predominant subtype expressed in nonhepatic tissues and most cell lines (7Shimomura I. Shimano H. Horton J.D. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 838-845Crossref PubMed Scopus (642) Google Scholar). Cholesterol regulates proteolytic cleavage of SREBP1a and -2 to release a mature (or nuclear) 65-kDa protein,i.e. nSREBP. nSREBP is a basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor that binds sterol response elements (SRE) and some E-boxes in sterol-responsive genes, e.g.hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA reductase, low density lipoprotein receptor, and fatty acid synthase. Studies in transgenic mice overexpressing different SREBP subtypes suggest that SREBP1 may play a major role in the control of lipogenic gene expression, whereas SREBP2 functions in the regulation of cholesterol synthesis (7Shimomura I.

Unsaturated fatty acids reduced the nuclear content of SREBP1a in cultured CV1, CHO, and HepG2 cells (5Worgall T.S. Sturley S.L. Seo T. Osborne T.F. Deckelbaum R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25537-25540Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). The linkage of SREBP1 to lipogenic gene expression and the fact that unsaturated fatty acids affect the nSREBP1 levels suggest fatty acid control of lipogenic gene expression might involve the regulation of nSREBP1 abundance. In this report, we have examined the role hepatic SREBP1c plays in the PUFA regulation of rat hepatic lipogenic gene expression. Our studies show that PUFA down-regulates mRNASREBP1 in liver and cultured primary hepatocytes but not in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Like other lipogenic genes (5Worgall T.S. Sturley S.L. Seo T. Osborne T.F.

PUFA also suppresses the nuclear content of SREBP1 in cultured primary hepatocytes.

With this model we tested the hypothesis that SREBP1c functionally interacts with the PUFA response region (PUFA RR). Our studies have localized a cis-regulatory target for SREBP1c action within the S14 promoter. Moreover, overexpression of SREBP1c significantly affects PUFA regulation of S14 gene expression. These studies provide compelling evidence for SREBP1c as a principal target for PUFA control of S14 gene transcription and possibly other hepatic lipogenic genes.

Since PUFA suppress lipogenic gene expression in liver, we examined the effect of different fat diets on hepatic SREBP1 gene expression (Fig.1). Rats were meal-fed a high carbohydrate diet containing no fat or supplemented with lard, olive, corn, walnut, or fish oil at 10% w/w for 5 days. Hepatic levels of mRNAs encoding SREBP1, FAS, S14, and LPK (panel A) and serum triglycerides (panel B) were measured. Although our SREBP1 cDNA cannot distinguish between SREBP1a and -1c, the predominant subtype expressed in liver is SREBP1c (7Shimomura I. Shimano H. Horton J.D. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 838-845Crossref PubMed Scopus (642) Google Scholar). Thus, Northern analysis of hepatic mRNA reflects measurement of SREBP1c gene expression. When compared with rats fed a fat-free diet, the addition of either saturated or monounsaturated fat to the high carbohydrate diet had no effect on the hepatic levels of any mRNA examined. However, hepatic levels of all four mRNAs were suppressed by diets containing PUFA. Fish oil was the most potent inhibitor of lipogenic gene expression. The effects of dietary fat on mRNASREBP1c are specific because previous studies have shown that these dietary fats have no effect on the mRNA encoding β-actin, glucokinase, or phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (4Mater M.K. Thelen A.P. Jump D.B. J. Lipid Res. 1999; 40: 1045-1052Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Jump D.B. Clarke S.D. Thelen A. Liimatta L. J.

Gonzalez F.J. Jump D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26827-26832Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). SREBP1a has been linked to the expression of genes involved in triglyceride assembly and secretion in hepatoma cell lines (28Wang S.L. Du E.Z. Martin T.D. Davis R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19351-19358Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Our results show that of the dietary fats tested, only fish oil suppressed serum triglycerides. Thus, PUFA regulation of hepatic de novo lipogenesis and triglyceride synthesis may not be tightly correlated to serum triglycerides. A major target for fatty acid regulation of gene expression in the liver is PPARα (2Reddy J.K. Mannaerts G.P. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 1994; 14: 343-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar, 3Ren B.

To access the contribution PPARα makes to the regulation of hepatic SREBP1 gene expression, rats were fed a high carbohydrate diet supplemented with the PPARα activators gemfibrozil (0.2% w/w) or WY14,643 (0.1% w/w) for 7 days. Using mRNACYP4A as a positive control for PPARα activation (3Ren B. Thelen A.P. Peters J.M. Gonzalez F.J. Jump D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26827-26832Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar), gemfibrozil and WY14,643 induced mRNACYP4A 2.2- and 6-fold, respectively. In contrast, mRNASREBP1c was unaffected by these treatments (Fig.2 A). A second approach to assess PPARα involvement in SREBP1 gene expression used RNAs derived from wild type (+/+) and PPARα null (−/−) mice fed either olive or fish oil for 5 days (3Ren B. Thelen A.P. Peters J.M. Gonzalez F.J. Jump D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26827-26832Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). In wild type mice, fish oil promoted a modest (∼20%) decline in mRNASREBP1. However, in PPARα null (−/−) mice, fish oil suppressed hepatic mRNASREBP1 by 70% (Fig.2 B).

Amyloid fibril formation and deposition have been associated with a wide range of diseases, including spongiform encephalopathies, Alzheimer's disease, and familial amyloid polyneuropathies (FAP). In certain forms of FAP, the amyloid fibrils are mostly constituted by variants of transthyretin (TTR), a homotetrameric plasma protein implicated in the transport of thyroxine and retinol. The most common amyloidogenic TTR variant is V30M-TTR, and L55P-TTR is the variant associated with the most aggressive form of FAP. Recently, we reported that TTR dissociates to a monomeric species at pH 7.0 and nearly physiological ionic strengths (Quintas, A., Saraiva, M. J., and Brito, R. M. (1997) FEBS Lett.418, 297–300). Here, we show that the tetramer dissociation is apparently irreversible; and based on intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence and fluorescence quenching experiments, we show that the monomeric species formed upon tetramer dissociation is non-native. We also show, based on 1-anilino-8-naph-thalenesulfonate binding studies, that this monomeric species appears not to behave like a molten globule.

Comparison between the crystal structures of WT- and V30M-TTR showed a very similar global fold for both proteins. Substitution of valine 30 by methionine forces the β-sheets of the monomer ∼1 Å apart, resulting in the distortion of the thyroxine-binding cavity (5Hamilton J.A. Steinrauf L.K. Braden B.C.

However, the small differences between the crystal structures of WT- and V30M-TTR have not clearly pointed out the causes for the amyloidogenicity of V30M-TTR. Very recently, based on the crystal structure of the highly amyloidogenic L55P-TTR, a model for TTR amyloid fibrils has been proposed consisting of a tubular structure with inner and outer diameters of ∼30 and 100 Å, respectively, and four monomers per cross-section (7Sebastião M.P. Saraiva M.J. Damas A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24715-24722Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Westermark and co-workers (8Gustavsson Å. Engström U. Westermark P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1990; 175: 1159-1164Crossref Scopus (110) Google Scholar) have reported the formation of amyloid by TTR in vitro at low pH. This observation has led to the proposal of a low pH environment as a prerequisite for amyloid formation in vivo (9Colon W. Kelly J.W. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 8654-8660Crossref PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar). These authors proposed that the low pH medium (present for example in the lysosomes) would induce tetramer rearrangement and dissociation to a monomeric amyloidogenic intermediate with altered tertiary structure, which in turn would self-assemble to form amyloid fibrils (10Lai Z. Colón W. Kelly J.W. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 6470-6482Crossref PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar). However, this proposal, with lysosomal involvement, implies the formation of amyloid intermediates intracellularly, which is not consistent with the observation that TTR amyloid deposits are extracellular (11Adams D. Said G. J. Neurol. 1996; 243: 73-76PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, in FAP, amyloid deposition occurs predominantly in the peripheral nerves, and both TTR mRNA and protein are not detected in the cellular components of nerves. Thus, amyloid assembly and deposition must take place extracellularly. Additionally, at low pH, both amyloidogenic and non-amyloidogenic TTR variants form amyloidin vitro. Here, we show that the TTR tetramer dissociates to non-native monomeric species at pH 7 and nearly physiological ionic strengths, and the monomeric species may self-assemble into high molecular mass aggregates. Our data allowed us to propose a novel model for amyloidogenesis by TTR under commonly observed physiological conditions and thus consistent with extracellular amyloid deposit formation. ANS, potassium iodide (KI), guanidinium hydrochloride, and all other chemicals were of the highest purity commercially available and were purchased from Sigma. Recombinant WT- and V30M-TTR were produced in anEscherichia coli expression system (12Furuya H. Saraiva M.J.M. Gawinowicz M.A. Alves I.L. Costa P.P. Sasaki H. Goto I. Sakaki Y.

Endocrine. 1997; 6: 309-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were determined spectrophotometrically at 280 nm using an extinction coefficient of 7.76 × 104m−1cm−1 based on a molecular mass of 55 kDa for TTR (A 2801% = 14.1 mg−1 ml cm−1) (14Van Jaarsveld P.P. Edelhoch H. Goodman D.S. Robbins J. J. Biol. Chem. 1973; 248: 4698-4705Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Protein dilutions were prepared in 20 mm sodium phosphate buffer and 150 mm sodium chloride, pH 7.0. When needed, TTR samples were re-concentrated by ultrafiltration on a Centricon-3 (Amicon, Inc.) with a molecular mass cutoff of 3 kDa. Tetrameric and monomeric species of all TTR variants were isolated by gel filtration chromatography performed on an Amersham Pharmacia Biotech FPLC Superdex-75 HR column coupled to an Amersham Pharmacia Biotech high precision P-500 pump and a UV detector equipped with a deuterium lamp and an integrator from Konik Instruments. The column was equilibrated with 20 mm sodium phosphate buffer and 150 mm sodium chloride, pH 7.0, and was frequently cleaned with 0.5 m NaOH. All runs were performed at a flow rate of 0.4 ml/min. Apparent molecular masses were calculated by interpolation on an elution volume versus log(molecular mass) calibration curve for four protein standards: bovine serum albumin (66 kDa), carbonic anhydrase (29 kDa), cytochrome c (12.4 kDa), and aprotinin (6.5 kDa). TTR monomeric species were further identified by ultrafiltration experiments performed on Centri/Por centrifuge concentrators (Spectrum Science, Inc.) with a molecular mass cutoff of 15 kDa and by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis performed on an Amersham Pharmacia Biotech PhastSystem. Fluorescence experiments were performed on a SPEX Industries Fluorlog spectrofluorometer. For intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence studies and fluorescence quenching studies by KI, an excitation wavelength of 280 nm was used, and the excitation and emission slits were set to 1.5 and 2 mm, respectively. Quenching studies were performed by adding small aliquots of a freshly prepared stock solution of KI to 0.5–1 μm protein solutions. For ANS binding studies, an excitation wavelength of 370 nm, excitation slits of 1.5 mm, and emission slits of 2 mm were used. Final sample dilution in the KI and ANS titrations never exceed 1%. All fluorescence studies were performed at a controlled temperature of 25.0 °C and on a 1.0-cm path length cuvette. Solvent-accessible surface area calculations were performed using the coordinates from the refined crystal structures of WT- and V30M-TTR (5Hamilton J.A. Steinrauf L.K. Braden B.C. Liepnieks J. Benson M.D. Holmgren G. Sandgren O. Steen L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2416-2424Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and the program GRASP (15Nichols A. Sharp K.A. Honig B. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 1991; 11: 281-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (5318) Google Scholar) running on a SGi Octane workstation. The solvent-accessible surface area of the TTR tryptophan residues was compared with the solvent-accessible surface area of tryptophan in the tripeptide Gly-Trp-Gly to evaluate the relative solvent exposure of each one of the tryptophan residues in the tetramer and native monomeric subunits of WT- and V30M-TTR. Tetrameric and monomeric species of WT- and V30M-TTR were isolated by gel filtration chromatography based on the dissociation behavior of the tetramers, previously reported (16Quintas A. Saraiva M.J. Brito R.M.M. FEBS Lett. 1997; 418: 297-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Fig. 2 A shows gel filtration elution profiles of WT- and V30M-TTR with the characteristic equilibria between major species in solution at pH 7, room temperature, and a total protein concentration of 0.3 μm (calculated as the tetramer). The chromatograms show the presence of two peaks with elution volumes of 8.8 and 15.2 ml, corresponding to apparent molecular masses of 60 kDa (the tetramer) and 5.9 kDa (a monomeric species, referred to hereafter as M5.9). 2The low value of the apparent molecular mass for the monomeric species is due to protein interactions with the chromatographic matrix and cannot be taken as an approximation of the real molecular mass. The monomeric nature of this M5.9 species has also been confirmed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and ultrafiltration experiments performed on centrifuge concentrators with a molecular mass cutoff of 15 kDa. In the ultrafiltration experiments, a solution with approximately equimolar quantities of tetramer and M5.9 WT-TTR was placed in the upper chamber of the concentrator and centrifuged at 1500 × g for 1.5 h. Gel filtration chromatography of the contents of the upper and lower chambers showed the presence of mostly tetramer in the upper chamber and mostly M5.9 species in the lower chamber. Taking in consideration the molecular mass cutoff of the membrane used (15 kDa) and the molecular masses of the TTR dimer and tetramer (27.5 and 55 kDa respectively), we concluded that the M5.9 species is in fact monomeric. Additionally, SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis experiments (Fig.3) clearly showed that whereas non-boiled L55P-TTR tetramer ran as a dimer on the gel, as previously reported for WT-TTR by others (17McCutchen S.L. Lai Z. Miroy G.J. Kelly J.W. Colón W. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 13527-13536Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar, 18Goldsteins G. Andersson K. Olofsson A. Dacklin I. Edvisson Å. Baranov V. Sandgren O. Thylen C. Hammarström S. Lundgren E. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 5346-5352Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), non-boiled M5.9 L55P-TTR ran as a monomer with an apparent molecular mass of ∼15 kDa. These experiments clearly show the monomeric nature of the M5.9 species.Figure 3SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of L55P-TTR.

The gel was developed by silver staining.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) TTR tetrameric and monomeric (M5.9) species were isolated by gel filtration chromatography to characterize them by intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence, iodide fluorescence quenching, and ANS binding. To isolate tetrameric species, TTR samples were applied to the chromatography column at high protein concentrations (>1 mg/ml). To isolate the major monomeric species (M5.9), TTR samples were applied to the chromatography column at a concentration below 0.05 mg/ml. Fig.2 B shows gel filtration chromatograms of WT- and V30M-TTR tetramers after being studied by fluorescence, indicating that in both cases the tetramers were >99% pure. Fig. 2 C shows gel filtration chromatograms of the M5.9 samples for WT- and V30M-TTR after collection from the preparative run of gel filtration chromatography, re-concentration by ultrafiltration, fluorescence assays, and re-injection into the chromatography column. The ultrafiltration was performed on centrifuge concentrators with a molecular mass cutoff of 3 kDa. For WT-TTR, the re-concentration process of the M5.9 species led to the appearance of another monomeric species (M2.8), with an elution volume of 17.2 ml. However, in V30M-TTR, only the M5.9 species was observed after the re-concentration process. The conversion between M5.9 and other species was highly dependent on total protein concentration and the TTR variant being studied. Interestingly, re-concentration of the M5.9 species up to concentrations of 2 μm (corresponding to 0.5 μm tetramer) (Fig.2 C) did not produce tetrameric species, indicating that the dissociation equilibrium of the tetramer seems to be irreversible at nearly physiological pH, which may suggest a monomeric species conformationally altered from the native TTR subunit. To evaluate the interconversion between molecular species of TTR in solution, we incubated, at 37 °C for several days, tetrameric TTR of a highly amyloidogenic variant (L55P-TTR). Fig.4 shows a time course for the interconversion of the L55P-TTR tetramer to several other species at pH 7 and 37 °C, followed by gel filtration chromatography. It is clear that initially the tetramer dissociated to small amounts of M5.9 monomer (Fig. 4 A), which, after 24 h of incubation at 37 °C, led to the formation of several other monomeric species (Fig.4 B). Incubation of the L55P-TTR tetramer at 37 °C and pH 7 for periods of up to 2 weeks led to a significant decrease in the tetramer concentration, an increase in the number and amount of monomeric species, and the formation in solution of high molecular mass aggregates with elution volumes of 6.0 and 6.8 ml (Fig. 4 C). The formation of high molecular mass aggregates following the appearance of monomeric species in solution (Fig. 4) and the direct dissociation of these aggregates to monomeric species (16Quintas A. Saraiva M.J. Brito R.M.M. FEBS Lett. 1997; 418: 297-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) strongly suggest that the TTR aggregates are assembled from one or more types of monomeric species. These data agree with and extend to pH 7 the recently reported results of analytical ultracentrifugation studies that showed aggregate formation after a few hours of TTR incubation at low pH (19Lashuel H.A. Lai Z. Kelly J. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 17851-17864Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Additionally, when late eluting species (Fig.4 C) were collected and re-injected into the gel filtration column, they eluted as a mixture of species corresponding to the initial and M5.9 elution positions, showing interconversion between these monomeric species. Analysis of the intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence spectra (Fig. 5) of the tetrameric and monomeric species of WT- and V30M-TTR, isolated by gel filtration chromatography (Fig. 2, B and C), revealed that the tetrameric species of the two TTR variants have very similar emission maxima at ∼340 nm (Fig. 5). However, the fluorescence spectra of the M5.9 WT- and V30M-TTR samples show different blue-shifted emission maxima at 330 and 335 nm, respectively (Fig. 5). The tryptophan emission maxima at ∼340 nm observed for both TTR tetramers are indicative of partially buried tryptophans. TTR has two tryptophan residues per protein subunit at positions 41 and 79. Using site-directed mutagenesis, it has been shown that Trp79 exhibits very low fluorescence at pH 7 and that most of the intrinsic fluorescence is due to Trp41 (10Lai Z. Colón W. Kelly J.W. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 6470-6482Crossref PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar). The solvent-accessible surface areas of Trp41 and Trp79 in tetrameric WT-TTR are ∼83.0 and 2.5 Å2, respectively (Table I), showing that the silent tryptophan is almost totally buried in the protein interior, whereas the observable tryptophan is partially exposed to the solvent. The solvent-accessible surface area of a totally exposed tryptophan residue in the model tripeptide Gly-Trp-Gly is 243.2 Å2. Thus, in the tetrameric form of WT-TTR, Trp41 has a solvent exposure of 34.1%, and Trp79 has a solvent exposure of just 1.0%. The values of solvent exposure for tetrameric V30M-TTR are very similar to those obtained for WT-TTR (Table I). This agrees well with the observation of a partially buried tryptophan responsible for the emission maximum at 340 nm in tetrameric WT- and V30M-TTR (Fig. 5).Table ISolvent-accessible surface areas of the tryptophan residues in transthyretin, calculated using the program GRASP (15Nichols A.

Open table in a new tab The fluorescence emission maxima at 330 and 335 nm for M5.9 WT- and V30M-TTR, respectively, are in apparent contradiction with what was expected for a native TTR monomer. In fact, the tryptophan solvent-accessible surface areas calculated from the native TTR subunit in the crystal structures of WT- and V30M-TTR are very similar to those calculated for the tetramers (Table I). According to this, the emission maximum of a native monomer should be very close to the emission maximum of the tetramer, i.e. 340 nm. The significant blue shifts of 10 and 5 nm observed for M5.9 WT- and V30M-TTR suggest that they are non-native monomeric species. The observed blue shifts can be due to a lower solvent exposure of the tryptophans and consequently a more hydrophobic environment around the tryptophan residues or to fluorescence quenching of the tryptophan on the red side of the emission envelope of the native tetramer (Trp41). Both of these hypotheses are consistent with structural changes around the tryptophans' environment and with an altered structure of the M5.9 species when compared with the native TTR subunit. The larger line width at half-height of the emission spectrum of M5.9 WT-TTR sample is most probably due to the presence of a significant amount of M2.8 WT-TTR (Figs. 2 C and 5). This species has a red-shifted emission maximum relative to the M5.9 species and the tetramer (data not shown); and thus, it is not responsible for the large blue shift observed for M5.9 WT-TTR. The larger blue shift of the M5.9 WT-TTR emission spectrum compared with the M5.9 V30M-TTR emission spectrum is mostly probably due to different solvent exposures of the tryptophans in M5.9 WT- and V30M-TTR. This difference in the emission maximum of M5.9 WT- and V30M-TTR may indicate important structural or dynamic changes between these two monomeric species, which are not observed in the tetrameric forms. We have already shown that the tetrameric form of a highly amyloidogenic TTR variant (L55P-TTR) dissociated to the M5.9 species, which in turn led to the formation of several other monomeric species (Fig. 4). Fig. 6 shows a comparison between the fluorescence emission spectra of tetrameric and some of these monomeric forms of L55P-TTR. The emission maximum of the tetramer is 340 nm, like what was observed for the tetrameric forms of WT- and V30M-TTR. However, the emission maxima of the late eluting monomeric species (Fig. 4 C), between 352 and 359 nm, are all red-shifted relative to the emission maxima of the tetramer, indicating a more polar environment around the tryptophan residues probably due to a higher solvent exposure of the tryptophans in these monomeric species. These data suggest that the late eluting monomeric species (Fig. 4 C), derived from the M5.9 species, are probably partially unfolded. To further characterize the differences in solvent-accessible surface area between the tetrameric and M5.9 forms of WT- and V30M-TTR, we performed iodide fluorescence quenching experiments. Iodide is a large anion thought to have access only to surface-exposed Trp residues (20Eftink M.R. Ghiron C.A. Biochemistry. 1976; 15: 672-680Crossref PubMed Scopus (992) Google Scholar). Iodide fluorescence quenching experiments on tetrameric and M5.9 WT- and V30M-TTR were analyzed assuming the absence of static quenching and using the Stern-Volmer formalism, F 0/F = 1+ K SV[Q], where F 0 andF are the fluorescence intensities in the absence and presence, respectively, of quencher Q, and K SVis the Stern-Volmer constant (Fig. 7) (21Lehrer S.S. Leavis P.C. Methods Enzymol. 1978; 49: 222-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). The Stern-Volmer plots for tetrameric WT- and V30M-TTR show positive slopes with Stern-Volmer constants of 5.3 and 6.4m−1, respectively. For comparison, we determined the Stern-Volmer constant for denatured WT-TTR in the presence of 6 m guanidinium chloride and found a value of 8.1 m−1 (Fig. 7). These results agree with those from intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence experiments, indicating that in WT- and V30M-TTR tetramers, the Trp residues responsible for the observed fluorescence are partially exposed to the solvent. On the other hand, M5.9 WT- and V30M-TTR did not show any significant quenching by iodide, with Stern-Volmer constants close to zero, suggesting that the tryptophans responsible for the observed fluorescence are completely buried and not accessible to the solvent. These results agree with those from the intrinsic fluorescence experiments (Fig. 5), suggesting that in the M5.9 species, Trp41 becomes highly quenched and/or is not very accessible to the solvent. To evaluate the structural integrity of the M5.9 monomeric species and to compare the binding properties of the tetrameric and monomeric species of WT- and V30M-TTR, we performed ANS binding experiments (Fig. 8). ANS fluorescence is highly sensitive to the hydrophobicity of the surrounding chemical environment and has been widely used to probe apolar binding sites in proteins and, more recently, as a qualitative identification tool for protein molten globules (22Stryer L. Science. 1968; 162: 526-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (622) Google Scholar, 23Miranker A.D. Dobson C. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1996; 6: 31-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Free ANS fluoresces weakly in aqueous solution, but an apolar environment tends to increase the quantum yield and to blue-shift the emission maximum of ANS. Fig. 8 (A and B) shows the effect on the fluorescence emission spectra of increasing concentrations of ANS in the presence of WT- and V30M-TTR tetramers. The emission maxima of ANS in the presence of WT- and V30M-TTR tetramers are 467 and 472 nm, respectively, showing a markedly blue shift from the emission maximum of free ANS at ∼520 nm. The fluorescence intensity also increased >100-fold in the presence of the TTR tetramers. A nonlinear fit to the binding data (Fig. 8, A and B, insets) yielded K d values of 1.2 μm for the WT-TTR tetramer and 2.6 μm for the V30M-TTR tetramer, in agreement with previous studies on WT-TTR (24Cheng S.Y. Pages R.A. Saroff H.A. Edelhoch H. Robbins J. Biochemistry. 1977; 16: 3707-3713Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Competition studies have shown that ANS binds to the same sites as thyroxine in WT-TTR (24Cheng S.Y. Pages R.A. Saroff H.A. Edelhoch H. Robbins J. Biochemistry. 1977; 16: 3707-3713Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The thyroxine-binding site is highly apolar, which justifies the increase in fluorescence quantum yield and the blue shift of the emission maximum of ANS upon binding to tetrameric TTR. Fig. 8 (C and D) shows the effect on the fluorescence emission spectra of stepwise addition of ANS to M5.9 WT- and V30M-TTR. In both cases, the emission maximum is 520 nm, and the emission intensity varied linearly with ANS concentration (Fig. 8,C and D, insets), showing that ANS does not bind or binds very weakly to the M5.9 species. The dissociation of the TTR tetramer destroyed the thyroxine-binding site, which is located in the central cavity formed by the four TTR subunits (Fig. 1 A). Thus, high affinity binding of ANS to the thyroxine-binding region in the monomeric forms would not be expected. Additionally, these results also suggest that M5.9 WT- and V30M-TTR do not behave like a molten globule, which usually shows binding affinity for ANS. The molecular mechanisms for amyloid fibril formation have recently been the target of increasing attention due to their central role in several human and animal pathologies. Here, we present a novel model for amyloidogenesis by TTR based on the dissociation behavior of the tetrameric protein under nearly physiological conditions as studied by gel filtration chromatography, ultrafiltration, tryptophan intrinsic fluorescence, fluorescence quenching by iodide, and ANS binding. Gel filtration chromatography experiments with WT-TTR and the amyloidogenic variant V30M-TTR showed that the native tetrameric form of these proteins dissociates to a monomeric species (M5.9) at nearly physiological pH (Fig. 2) (16Quintas A. Saraiva M.J. Brito R.M.M. FEBS Lett. 1997; 418: 297-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence (Fig.5) and fluorescence quenching by iodide (Fig. 7) of the tetrameric and M5.9 species revealed altered spectroscopic properties of the tryptophan residues and thus a structural change in the M5.9 species in comparison with the native subunit. Additionally, re-concentration of the M5.9 species up to concentrations of 0.03 mg/ml (0.5 μm, calculated as the tetramer), where >50% of the tetramer would be expected, did not show any detectable amount of tetrameric species (Fig. 2 C). These results may indicate that the tetramer dissociates irreversibly to a non-native monomeric species at nearly physiological pH. The formation of this non-native monomer upon tetramer dissociation may be due to the exposure to the solvent of the large hydrophobic surface in the intersubunit interface. Thus, the entropic pressure to hide this hydrophobic surface from the solvent may be responsible for the structural changes occurring in the TTR subunits upon tetramer dissociation. These structural changes may differ between amyloidogenic and non-amyloidogenic variants of TTR. Incubation at 37 °C of a highly amyloidogenic TTR variant, L55P-TTR, followed by gel filtration chromatography and fluorescence, showed the interconversion of the M5.9 species to several other partially unfolded monomeric species (Figs. 4 and 6). Additionally, the formation of non-native monomeric species seems to be the initial step in the pathway of self-assembly, leading to the formation of high molecular mass aggregates (Fig. 4 C). We have also previously shown that high molecular mass aggregates formed by amyloidogenic TTR variants dissociate directly to the M5.9 species upon dilution (16Quintas A. Saraiva M.J. Brito R.M.M. FEBS Lett. 1997; 418: 297-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Based on the observations above, we propose a novel model for amyloid fibril formation by TTR under nearly physiological conditions (Fig.9). The first and very important step is the irreversible dissociation of tetrameric TTR to a non-native monomer (M5.9). This irreversible step may allow accumulation of the M5.9 species, which is then interconverted to other partially unfolded monomeric species. The presence of non-native monomeric species in solution leads to the formation of high molecular mass soluble aggregates. These soluble aggregates may dissociate directly to non-native monomeric species upon dilution. Thus, it seems that a complex equilibrium between non-native monomeric species, partially unfolded monomeric species, and soluble aggregates may exist at nearly physiological pH. These soluble aggregates may constitute the seeding units for amyloid fibril formation. Lundgren and co-workers (18Goldsteins G. Andersson K. Olofsson A. Dacklin I. Edvisson Å. Baranov V. Sandgren O. Thylen C. Hammarström S. Lundgren E. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 5346-5352Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) showed that formation of soluble aggregates in highly amyloidogenic variants of TTR correlates with the formation of amyloid precipitates. The recently reported results of analytical ultracentrifugation studies show soluble aggregate formation after a few hours of TTR incubation at low pH, preceding the formation of amyloid protofilaments (19Lashuel H.A. Lai Z. Kelly J. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 17851-17864Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Moreover, it has been shown by x-ray diffraction of TTR amyloid fibers that axially arrayed TTR monomers constitute the fiber protofilament (25Inouye H. Domingues F.S. Damas A.M. Saraiva M.J. Lundgren E. Sandgren O. Kirschner D.A. Amyloid. 1998; 5: 163-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The TTR protein concentration in the serum ranges between 0.17 and 0.42 mg/ml (3.1–7.6 μm) (3Vatassery G.T. Quach H.T. Smith W.E. Benson B.A. Eckfeldt J.H. Clin. Chim. Acta. 1991; 197: 19-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), which is consistent with a high percentage of tetramer, as has been commonly indicated in the literature. However, the apparent irreversibility of the tetramer-to-monomer dissociation process may lead to the accumulation in some tissues of non-native monomeric species, some of them potentially amyloidogenic, allowing aggregate formation and slow amyloid fiber growth. Thus, the amyloidogenic potential of some TTR variants could be related to different tendencies of their non-native monomeric species to be converted into monomeric amyloidogenic intermediates, which in turn could self-aggregate and eventually form amyloid fibrils. This could also justify the different FAP onset ages produced by different TTR variants. Previously, other authors proposed that a low pH environment (present, for example, in the lysosomes) would be a prerequisite for amyloid formation in vivo (9Colon W. Kelly J.W. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 8654-8660Crossref PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar). These authors proposed that the low pH medium would induce tetramer rearrangement and dissociation to a monomeric amyloidogenic intermediate with altered tertiary structure, which in turn would self-assemble to form amyloid fibrils (10Lai Z. Colón W. Kelly J.W. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 6470-6482Crossref PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar). However, this proposal implies the formation of the amyloid intermediates intracellularly, which is not consistent with the observation that TTR amyloid deposits are extracellular (11Adams D. Said G. J. Neurol. 1996; 243: 73-76PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, in FAP, amyloid deposition occurs predominantly in the peripheral nerves, and both TTR mRNA and protein are not detected in the cellular components of nerves. Thus, amyloid assembly and deposition must take place extracellularly. Here, we showed that the formation of a non-native TTR monomer may occur at pH 7 and therefore does not require lysosomal participation. Our model for TTR amyloidogenesis is based on the natural tendency shown by TTR to irreversibly dissociate to a non-native monomeric species under nearly physiological conditions. Thus, tetramer stability to dissociation could play some role in the amyloidogenic potential of the TTR variants (17McCutchen S.L. Lai Z. Miroy G.J. Kelly J.W. Colón W.

Biochem. 1997; 249: 662-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), but more important, the structure, stability, and/or dynamics of the non-native monomeric species may play a crucial role in aggregate formation and potentially amyloidogenesis. Some of the TTR mutations could perturb protein stability and favor structural fluctuations of the monomeric species to an extent that could lead initially to the formation of soluble aggregates of these monomeric species and, at a later stage, to formation of insoluble amyloid fibrils.

https://openalex.org/W1965802234,"We have recently demonstrated that the D3-phosphoinositide phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PtdIns-3,4,5-P3) is critical for producing sustained calcium signals through its role in promoting the function of TEC family tyrosine kinases such as Bruton's tyrosine kinase. Although PtdIns-3,4,5-P3 can potentially be synthesized by any of several types of phosphoinositide 3-kinases (PI3Ks), B cell receptor (BCR)-induced PtdIns-3,4,5-P3 production is thought to occur primarily through the activation of the class Ia (p85/p110) PI3Ks. This process has been proposed to be mediated by an interaction between the Src family kinase LYN and the p85 subunit of PI3K and/or through p85 membrane recruitment mediated by CBL and/or CD19. However, calcium signaling and other PI3K-dependent signals are relatively preserved in a LYN kinase-deficient B lymphocyte cell line, suggesting that an alternative pathway for PI3K activation exists. As SYK/ZAP70 kinases are upstream from many BCR-initiated signaling events, we directly analyzed SYK-dependent accumulation of both PtdIns-3,4,5-P3 and PtdIns-3,4-P2 in B cell receptor signaling using both dominant negative and genetic knockout approaches. Both methods indicate that SYK is upstream of, and necessary for, a significant portion of BCR-induced PtdIns-3,4,5-P3 production. Whereas CD19 does not appear to be involved in this SYK-dependent pathway, the SYK substrate CBL is likely involved as the dominant negative SYK markedly attenuates CBL tyrosine phosphorylation and completely blocks the BCR-dependent association of CBL with p85 PI3K.

In the case of the BCR, class Ia PI3K activation has been proposed to occur as the result of an interaction between the SRC family tyrosine kinase LYN SH3 domain and a proline-rich region of the class Ia PI3K p85 subunit (30Pleiman C.M. Hertz W.M. Cambier J.C. Science. 1994; 263: 1609-1612Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). Although consistent with in vitro binding data, this mechanism has difficulty accounting for why calcium responses in LYN-deficient DT40 B cells are of near normal maximal magnitude (40Takata M.

EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1341-1349Crossref PubMed Scopus (584) Google Scholar), why BTK tyrosine phosphorylation and activation, recently shown to be a PtdIns-3,4,5-P3-dependent process (4Scharenberg A.M.

Chem. 1997; 272: 15595-15598Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar), or why activation of AKT is not attenuated in LYN-deficient cells (42Li H. Davis W. Whiteman E. Birnbaum M. Pure E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 6890-6895Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). These findings suggest that whereas BCR-inducible PI3K activation may occur through p85 PI3K association with SRC family kinases, it can also proceed through SRC kinase-independent routes.The tyrosine kinase SYK is a 72-kDa tyrosine-phosphorylated protein activated early in BCR signaling. SYK is an important mediator of BCR-induced protein tyrosine phosphorylation and has been shown both genetically and in dominant negative studies to be necessary for receptor-induced calcium mobilization (5Fluckiger A.C. Li Z. Kato R.M. Wahl M.I. Ochs H.D. Longnecker R. Kinet J.P. Witte O.N. Scharenberg A.M. Rawlings D.J. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1973-1985Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar, 40Takata M. Sabe H. Hata A. Inazu T. Homma Y. Nukada T. Yamamura H. Kurosaki T. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1341-1349Crossref PubMed Scopus (584) Google Scholar). Because it is upstream from many types of BCR-dependent signaling events, we hypothesized that SYK could provide either an alternative or convergent link for antigen receptor-mediated PI3K activation. We therefore analyzed BCR-mediated PtdIns-3,4,5-P3 and PtdIns-3,4-P2 accumulation using TLC and HPLC analyses of32P-labeled B lymphocytes with either wild type SYK or mutant SYK. Our initial results indicated that a significant portion of BCR-induced PtdIns-3,4,5-P3 and PtdIns-3,4-P2accumulation is dependent on SYK function. We therefore undertook studies to address whether loss of SYK function impairs BCR-induced PI3K activity through CBL or CD19. We found that dominant negative SYK blocks association of p85 PI3K with CBL and attenuates CBL tyrosine phosphorylation but that CD19 tyrosine phosphorylation and CD19/p85 PI3K association after receptor engagement were unchanged.RESULTSIn order to analyze SYK-dependent PI3K signaling, we chose to utilize two different B cell receptor signaling systems where SYK function can be inhibited (Fig. 1). In the A20 B cell system, we expressed a dominant negative form of SYK (SYKT) that blocks the interaction of endogenous SYK with BCR ITAMs, resulting in a substantial, but not complete, inhibition of SYK functions such as calcium mobilization (Fig. 1 A, this represents a typical degree of inhibition for the samples used in the D3-phosphoinositide analyses). In the DT40 system, we compared wild type DT40 B cells with a DT40 cell line in which the soleSYK gene has been disrupted, resulting in a complete loss of SYK-dependent functions including the calcium signal ((40) and Fig. 1 B). These systems provide complementary information because the dominant negative SYK not only blocks the interaction of endogenous SYK with the BCR ITAMs but also other molecules such as SHC which are potentially involved in PI3K signaling. In contrast, in the SYK-deficient DT40 system, ITAM-interacting proteins will have enhanced access because SYK is not present to interact with the BCR ITAMs, potentially resulting in artifactual signaling processes. In this way, information from both systems controls for potentially confounding problems with either system used alone.Inhibition of SYK Function Blocks D3-phosphoinositide AccumulationFor assessment of PI3K activation, we chose to measure the in vivo accumulation of both PtdIns-3,4,5-P3 and PtdIns-3,4-P2. Measurement of the level of accumulation of PtdIns-3,4,5-P3 provides the most direct measure of the activation of class Ia PI3Ks, the PI3K subtype linked to BCR-signaling pathways. However, PtdIns-3,4,5-P3 typically accumulates only to a limited extent after antigen receptor activation in a variety of systems (including the A20 system), with the level of its accumulation approaching the detection limits of HPLC analysis in the A20 system (4Scharenberg A.M. El-Hillal O. Fruman D.A. Beitz L.O. Li Z. Lin S. Gout I. Cantley L.C. Rawlings D.J. Kinet J.P. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1961-1972Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). Because of this, it is informative to additionally monitor the accumulation of PtdIns-3,4-P2. PtdIns-3,4-P2typically accumulates to higher and therefore more easily detectable levels than does PtdIns-3,4,5-P3, and is accordingly both less variable and a better measure of small differences in signal magnitude (19Carpenter C.L. Duckworth B.C. Auger K.R. Cohen B. Schaffhausen B.S. Cantley L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 19704-19711Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, as it is formed in part as a breakdown product of PtdIns-3,4,5-P3, the level of its accumulation in comparison with the level of PtdIns-3,4,5-P3accumulation provides a rough index of changes in the rate of PtdIns-3,4,5-P3 breakdown.SYKT Blocks D3-phosphoinositide Accumulation when Expressed in A20 B CellsA20 B cells were infected with either a control virus (GB) or the SYKT construct and then harvested and loaded with32P for lipid analysis. Loaded cells were then resuspended and stimulated as for the calcium studies in Fig. 1. Cells were lysed at the indicated times, and lipids were extracted, deacylated, and subjected to HPLC. As PtIns-3,4,5-P3 accumulates in such low quantities after stimulation in the A20 system as to be difficult to differentiate from base-line unstimulated cells by HPLC analysis, the extracts of six individual experiments were combined for D3-phosphoinositide accumulation. As can be seen in Fig.2, PtIns-3,4,5-P3accumulation is attenuated by approximately 40% and PtIns-3,4-P2 accumulation by approximately 50% after BCR engagement. Two additional experiments for PtIns-3,4-P2accumulation both confirmed the 50% attenuation of PtIns-3,4-P2 accumulation of GB versus SYKT constructs after BCR engagement (data not shown). These results suggest SYK is necessary for normal PI3K activation after BCR engagement or that the dominant negative SYK was interfering with access to the BCR ITAMs of another molecule required for PI3K activation.Figure 2Inhibition of SYK function blocks D3-phosphoinositide accumulation in A20 B cells. 1 × 107 cells/time point were loaded with 1 mCi of [32P]orthophosphate/107 cells for 1 h, resuspended in calcium buffer at 1-ml per time point, and stimulated as above. Cells were lysed at the given times and lipids extracted. Six experiments were combined at this point, and samples were deacylated and analyzed by HPLC. Accumulations of PtdIns-3,4,5-P3 and PtdIns-3,4-P2 are shown.

DT40 wild type or SYK-deficient cells were loaded with32P, and D3-phosphoinositide accumulation was analyzed by HPLC as above (Fig. 3 A). As can be seen, there is a complete block in PtIns-3,4,5-P3accumulation after BCR ligation in the SYK-deficient cells and nearly a complete block in PtIns-3,4-P2 accumulation (see graph), confirming the SYK dependence observed in the dominant negative experiments, and further suggesting that SYK function is required for significant levels of PtdIns-3,4,5-P3 accumulation. As TLC is generally more sensitive in detecting low levels of PtdIns-3,4,5-P3 than HPLC, we performed a TLC analysis of the wild type and SYK-deficient DT40 cells to further test the requirement for SYK in PtdIns-3,4,5-P3 production. As shown in Fig. 3 B, and in agreement with the HPLC results, little to no increase above base line in PtdIns-3,4,5-P3 is detectable in SYK-deficient DT40 cells, whereas a 3.5-fold increase in PtIns-3,4,5-P3 accumulation over base line is evident in the wild type DT40 cells. Taken together, these results demonstrate the critical role of SYK in BCR-induced D3-phosphoinositide production.Figure 3DT40 cells lacking SYK accumulate little to no D3-phosphoinositides. 1 × 107 DT40 wild type or SYK− cells/time point were suspended in calcium buffer at 1 × 107 cells/ml, loaded for 1 h at 37 °C with 1 mCi/107 cells [32P]orthophosphate, resuspended in 1 ml per time point, and stimulated with 10 μg/ml goat anti-chicken IgM for the given time. Cells were lysed, and lipids were extracted and deacylated and then analyzed by HPLC. Accumulated D3-phosphoinositides are representative of three separate experiments (A). Cells for TLC analysis were treated as in Awithout being subjected to deacylation.

The resultant proteins were separated by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, immunoblotted, and probed with anti-phosphotyrosine or anti-p85 PI3K antibodies (two separate experiments with same conditions of infectivity and stimulation). As can be seen in Fig.4, A and B, overexpression of SYKT results in attenuation of CBL tyrosine phosphorylation and complete block in association of p85 with CBL, indicating a role for CBL in this pathway. In contrast, as can be seen in Fig. 4 C, the association of CD19 with p85 is not altered in SYKT-overexpressing cells, nor is the tyrosine phosphorylation state, making CD19 an unlikely contributor to the SYK-dependent PI3K activation pathway.Figure 4SYKT overexpression blocks BCR-dependent CBL tyrosine phosphorylation and CBL association with p85 PI3K but does not alter BCR-dependent CD19 tyrosine phosphorylation or p85 PI3K association. 5× 107 A20 B cells (anti-phosphotyrosine A) or 1 × 108 A20 cells (anti-p85 PI3K-B) were infected for 16 h with GB or SYKT at 10 pfu/cell for CBL experiments.

In contrast, the data we have presented demonstrate that SYK plays a major role in linking the BCR to PtIns-3,4,5-P3 and PtIns-3,4-P2 accumulation and therefore PI3K activation and that this role is evident in two different BCR-signaling systems.Although SYK may mediate PI3K activation by a number of different pathways, one likely involves the adaptor molecule CBL. Our data support a model of SYK-dependent PI3K activation (see Fig.5) wherein after SYK is recruited to Igα/Igβ ITAMs and activated, it then tyrosine phosphorylates CBL, allowing CBL to associate with p85 PI3K. This would in turn activate PI3K lipid kinase activity, resulting in PtIns-3,4,5-P3 and subsequent PtIns-3,4-P2 accumulation. In this model, SYK-dependent phosphorylation of CBL would therefore play a role in CBL-dependent PI3K activation, thereby accounting for the upstream role of SYK in BCR-induced PtIns-3,4,5-P3accumulation. Although distinct from previous analysis of BCR PI3K signaling, our results are consistent with previous reports that SYK tyrosine phosphorylates CBL in a receptor-dependent manner (53Ota Y.

Therefore, one receptor-dependent pathway in which SYK may regulate PI3 kinase activity is through the tyrosine phosphorylation of CBL at the p85 PI3K-binding site (tyrosine 731).Figure 5Model of SYK-dependent BCR-induced PI3K activation.

(1997) FEBS Lett. 408, 81–84). Here we present data that the S100A8/A9 protein complex represents the exclusive arachidonic acid-binding proteins in human neutrophils. Binding and competition studies revealed evidence that (i) fatty acid binding was dependent on the calcium concentration; (ii) fatty acid binding was specific for the protein complex formed by S100A8 and S100A9, whereas the individual components were unable to bind fatty acids; (iii) exclusively polyunsaturated fatty acids were bound by S100A8/A9, whereas saturated (palmitic acid, stearic acid) and monounsaturated fatty acids (oleic acid) as well as arachidonic acid-derived eicosanoids (15-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid, prosta- glandin E2, thromboxane B2, leukotriene B4) were poor competitors. Stimulation of neutrophil-like HL-60 cells with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate led to the secretion of S100A8/A9 protein complex, which carried the released arachidonic acid. When elevation of intracellular calcium level was induced by A23187, release of arachidonic acid occurred without secretion of S100A8/A9. In view of the unusual abundance in neutrophilic cytosol (approximately 40% of cytosolic protein) our findings assign an important role for S100A8/A9 as mediator between calcium signaling and arachidonic acid effects. Further investigations have to explore the exact function of the S100A8/A9-arachidonic acid complex both inside and outside of neutrophils.

They are composed of two distinct EF-hands flanked by hydrophobic regions at either terminus and separated by a central hinge region, and they form a heterodimeric complex in a Ca2+-dependent manner. Heizmann and Schäfer (5Schäfer B.W. Heizmann C.W. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 134-140Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (885) Google Scholar) proposed a new logical nomenclature for these genes based on the physical arrangement of the genes encoding the S100 family on chromosome 1q21. According to this nomenclature, MRP8 and MRP14 are referred to as S100A8 and S100A9, respectively.Both proteins are expressed in circulating neutrophils and monocytes but are absent in normal tissue macrophages and lymphocytes (6Odink K.

Under chronic inflammatory conditions, such as psoriasis and malignant disorders, they are also expressed in the epidermis (10Brandtzaeg P. Dale I. Fagerhol M.K. Am. J. Clin. Pathol. 1987; 87: 700-707Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 11Wilkinson M.M. Busuttil A. Hayward C. Brock D.J. Dorin J.R. Van Heyningen V. J.

Dermatol. 1992; 99: 299-305Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). S100A8 and S100A9 are predominantly localized in the cytoplasm. Upon elevation of the intracellular calcium level they are translocated from the cytosol to cytoskeleton and to plasma membrane (13Roth J. Burwinkel F. van den Bos C. Goebeler M. Vollmer E. Sorg C. Blood. 1993; 82: 1875-1883Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). At a later time point, they appear as noncovalently associated S100A8/A9 heterodimers on the surface of monocytes (14Bhardwaj R.S. Zotz C. Zwadlo-Klarwasser G. Roth J. Goebeler M. Mahnke K. Falk M. Meinardus-Hager G. Sorg C. Eur. J. Immunol. 1992; 22: 1891-1897Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). The mechanism by which the S100A8/A9 heterodimer penetrates the plasma membrane and how the S100A8/A9 protein complex is anchored into the cell membrane, remains unclear since both proteins lack a transmembrane region. Upon the activation of protein kinase C S100A8/A9 heterodimers are released from human monocytes by a novel secretion pathway that is energy-consuming and depends on an intact microtubule network (15Murao S. Collart F. Huberman E. Cell Growth Differ. 1990; 1: 447-454PubMed Google Scholar, 16Rammes A. Roth J. Goebeler M. Klempt M. Hartmann M. Sorg C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9496-9502Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar). The presence of enhanced S100A8/A9 levels in sera from patients suffering from a number of inflammatory disorders including cystic fibrosis, rheumatoid arthritis, and chronic bronchitis may indicate an extracellular role for S100A8/A9 (17Goebeler M. Roth J. Burwinkel F. Vollmer E. Bocker W. Sorg C. Transplantation. 1994; 58: 355-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 18Roth J. Teigelkamp S. Wilke M. Grun L. Tummler B. Sorg C. Immunobiology. 1992; 186: 304-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 19Brun J.G. Jonsson R. Haga H.J. J. Rheumatol. 1994; 21: 733-738PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, Newton and Hogg (20Newton R.A. Hogg N. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 1427-1435PubMed Google Scholar) showed that S100A9 stimulates neutrophil adhesion, and S100A8 reversed the stimulatory effect probably by the formation of the heterodimer. However, the study fails to identify the cell type by which S100A9 is released independently from S100A8.In areas of acute inflammation, polymorphonuclear leukocytes, expressing the membrane-associated heterodimer S100A8/A9, are the predominant cell type. These cells have been shown to release high amounts of tumor necrosis factor-α and interleukin-1β, indicating that S100A8/A9 surface expression is restricted to activated or recruited phagocytes (7Zwadlo G. Bruggen J. Gerhards G. Schlegel R. Sorg C. Clin. Exp. Immunol. 1988; 72: 510-515PubMed Google Scholar). These phagocytes perform several host defense functions, such as phagocytosis of invading microorganisms and cell debris, release of proteolytic enzymes, and generation of reactive oxygen metabolites. In addition, they release a number of arachidonic acid-derived eicosanoids, which amplify or perpetuate the acute inflammatory response. This subset of phagocytes is present in acute but absent in chronic inflammatory disorders (14Bhardwaj R.S. Zotz C. Zwadlo-Klarwasser G. Roth J. Goebeler M. Mahnke K. Falk M. Meinardus-Hager G. Sorg C. Eur. J. Immunol. 1992; 22: 1891-1897Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). These findings have led to the assumption that S100A8 and S100A9 affect leukocyte trafficking and display a propagating role in inflammatory responses. Although there are a number of hypotheses, the exact functions of both proteins remain unknown.Recently, we and others showed that S100A8/A9 heterodimers specifically bind (poly)unsaturated fatty acids in a calcium-dependent manner (21Klempt M. Melkonyan H. Nacken W. Wiesmann D. Holtkemper U. Sorg C. FEBS Lett. 1997; 408: 81-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 22Siegenthaler G. Roulin K. Chatellard-Gruaz D. Hotz R. Saurat J.H. Hellman U. Hagens G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9371-9377Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), making them a good candidate for mediating effects of polyunsaturated fatty acids in a calcium-dependent fashion. Therefore, the present study was performed to consider the role of S100A8 and S100A9 in the arachidonic acid (AA)1 metabolism of neutrophils (for review, see Ref. 23Chilton F.H. Fonteh A.N. Surette M.E. Triggiani M. Winkler J.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1299: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). We investigated the specificity of the S100A8/A9 protein complex toward various fatty acids and AA-derived eicosanoids and its role upon the AA release. We found that S100A8/A9 may serve as an intermediate intracellular reservoir for AA, thereby probably modulating the activities of AA-metabolizing enzymes. Alternatively, the secreted S100A8/A9·AA complex may have an extracellular role whereby S100A8/A9 serves as shuttle protein to reach the target cells.DISCUSSIONThe investigation of the AA binding properties by using purified S100A8 and S100A9 from human neutrophils revealed that exclusively the S100A8/A9 protein complex binds AA in a calcium-dependent manner (Fig. 1, A and B). The estimated calcium concentration required to induce fatty acid binding was within the physiological range (Fig. 1 C). The fact that the individual components of the protein complex were unable to bind fatty acids either in the absence or in the presence of calcium leads to the assumption that docking of the two subunits creates an asymmetric fatty acid-binding site located at the interface between the subunits. In preliminary studies, different molar ratios of S100A8 and S100A9 were used in the presence of calcium to induce protein complex formation followed by the determination of AA binding capacity. They indicate that the protein complex that is able to bind AA consists of equal moles of S100A9 and S100A8. 2C. Kerkhoff, unpublished observations. This result is in accordance with other studies (33Teigelkamp S. Bhardwaj R.S. Roth J. Meinardus-Hager G. Karas M. Sorg C. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 13462-13467Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).The binding studies revealed that arachidonic acid binding was saturable and had specific binding characteristics. AK D of 0.2 μm and a stoichiometry of 0.4 mol of fatty acid/mol of S100A8/A9 heterodimer was derived from Scatchard analysis (Fig. 2). Klotz (35Klotz I.M. Science. 1982; 217: 1247-1249Crossref PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar) proposed that Scatchard analysis of ligand is only valid if an S-shaped curve for binding is obtained. This was not possible in the present investigation due to the limited binding capacity of the Lipidex material. Thus, the actual number of fatty acid molecules bound by the protein complex may be overestimated as outlined by Klotz (35Klotz I.M. Science. 1982; 217: 1247-1249Crossref PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar). On the other hand, it is worth mentioning that upon calcium binding, conformational changes lead to the exposure of hydrophobic surfaces. Therefore, the amount of protein-bound AA may be underestimated in the Lipidex assay, although the microcentrifuge tubes were precoated with poly(propylene glycol) to minimize nonspecific adsorption. Both limitations should be taken into account but do not change the interpretation that a part of the S100A8/A9 complex was able to bind AA (Fig. 2).Alternatively, the calculated stoichiometry is based on the assumption that the multimer displaying the AA binding capacity represents a heterodimer. However, whether S100A8/A9 represents a heterodimer or an oligomer containing S100A8 and S100A9 at equimolar concentrations is still in debate. We performed gel filtration with the native proteins followed by SDS-PAGE analysis (Fig. 3). In the absence of calcium the monomeric proteins could not be detected, indicating a strong interaction of S100A8 and S100A9 also in the absence of calcium. This assumption is also confirmed by the finding that the S100A8/A9 complex formation is not interfered by Ca2+-chelation (33Teigelkamp S. Bhardwaj R.S. Roth J. Meinardus-Hager G. Karas M. Sorg C. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 13462-13467Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The heterodimeric protein complex showed an apparentM r of 34 kDa in accordance to Siegenthaleret al. (22Siegenthaler G. Roulin K. Chatellard-Gruaz D. Hotz R. Saurat J.H. Hellman U. Hagens G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9371-9377Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). However, several biophysical determinations confirm that the heterodimer has a M r of 24 kDa (33Teigelkamp S. Bhardwaj R.S. Roth J. Meinardus-Hager G. Karas M. Sorg C. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 13462-13467Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 36Vogl T. Roth J. Sorg C. Hillenkamp F. Strupat K. J. Am. Soc. Mass Spectrom. 1999; 10: 1024-1030Google Scholar). Thus, the heterodimeric protein complex is assumed to show an unusual migration in size-exclusion chromatography. In addition to the heterodimer, a protein complex with a M r of 48 kDa was analyzed after the addition of calcium, and radiolabeled AA comigrated with both protein complexes, indicating that both complexes display AA binding capacity (Table I). The 48-kDa protein is assumed to represent a tetrameric protein complex consisting of two molecules of S100A8 and two molecules of S100A9. The existence of the tetramer is confirmed by a recently published study from our group by ultraviolet matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry (36Vogl T. Roth J. Sorg C. Hillenkamp F. Strupat K. J. Am. Soc. Mass Spectrom. 1999; 10: 1024-1030Google Scholar).In addition, both S100A8 and S100A9 have some post-translational modifications (33Teigelkamp S. Bhardwaj R.S. Roth J. Meinardus-Hager G. Karas M. Sorg C. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 13462-13467Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 36Vogl T. Roth J. Sorg C. Hillenkamp F. Strupat K. J. Am. Soc. Mass Spectrom. 1999; 10: 1024-1030Google Scholar), which may influence complex formation as well as fatty acid binding properties. However, phosphorylation of S100A9 within purified S100A8/A9 protein complexes did not affect the AA binding capacity (data not shown).The competition studies clearly indicate that exclusively polyunsaturated fatty acid are bound by the protein complex in a saturable and reversible manner, whereas saturated fatty acids, such as palmitic and stearic acids, and the monounsaturated oleic acid were poor competitors. The S100A8/A9 protein complex showed the highest specificity toward arachidonic acid. In addition, the S100A8/A9 complex did not show any affinity for AA-derived eicosanoids (Fig. 4,A and B). These assays give insights into the nature of the fatty acid binding site. The affinity was significantly influenced by (i) the polar heads, (ii) the number of the double bonds, and (iii) their position within the fatty acid molecule. The identification of this binding pocket is currently under investigation in our laboratory. The specificity toward polyunsaturated fatty acids as well as the reversibility of the binding to the protein complex excludes the possibility that merely a solvation of insoluble fatty acid calcium salts occurs. These results also argue against a coordination of the fatty acid by one of the calcium ions of the S100A8/A9 complex. In contrast to our results, Siegenthaler et al. (22Siegenthaler G. Roulin K. Chatellard-Gruaz D. Hotz R. Saurat J.H. Hellman U. Hagens G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9371-9377Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) found that S100A8/A9 shows specificity toward various fatty acids. This finding may be due to the fact that they used purified proteins from human keratinocytes for their binding and competition studies.In the present study we could show for the first time that the S100A8/A9 protein complex represents the only AA binding capacity in the neutrophilic cytosol. This finding is corroborated by the facts that (i) there was only a low capacity for AA binding in the neutrophilic cytosol in the absence of calcium (Fig. 5 A); (ii) the AA binding capacity in the cytosol was increased in a protein concentration-dependent manner after the addition of calcium, which induces the formation of S100A8/A9 protein complexes (Fig. 5 A); and (iii) the AA binding capacity in the cytosol was depleted by immunoprecipitation with the S100A8/A9 protein complex-specific monoclonal antibody 27E10 (Fig. 5 C). Furthermore, our conclusion is supported by the finding that members of the fatty acid binding protein family are not expressed in human neutrophils (37Roulin K. Hagens G. Hotz R. Saurat J.H. Veerkamp J.H. Siegenthaler G. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 247: 410-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Activated neutrophils, the predominant cell type present in areas of acute inflammation, release arachidonic acid as well as arachidonic acid-derived eicosanoids into the plasma where they may amplify or perpetuate the acute inflammatory response. Our novel finding that the S100A8/A9 protein complex represents the exclusive AA binding capacity in the neutrophilic cytosol together with their unusual abundance in human neutrophilic cytosol (34Edgeworth J.

The calcium-induced binding of AA points to a role of S100A8/A9 in the mobilization, metabolization, or release of AA.Therefore, the neutrophil-like HL-60 cells (for review, see Ref. 38Collins S.J. Blood. 1987; 70: 1233-1244Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) were used to study the release of AA as well as the secretion of S100A8/A9 heterodimers (Fig. 6). Arachidonic acid release was induced by either an increase of the intracellular calcium level by the calcium ionophore A23187 or an activation of protein kinases by the phorbol ester PMA (39Rodriguez C.G. Montero M. Alvarez J. Garcia-Sancho J. Crespo M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24751-24757Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 40Durstin M. Durstin S. Molski T.F. Becker E.L. Sha'afi R.I.

J. 1995; 310: 681-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). S100A8/A9 was secreted from neutrophil-like HL-60 cells by PMA, whereas the calcium ionophore A23187 was ineffective to induce the S100A8/A9 secretion. This finding was confirmed by the metabolic labeling of de novo-synthesized S100A8/A9 with [14C]leucine (data not shown), indicating that, in addition to monocytes as described by Rammes et al. (16Rammes A. Roth J. Goebeler M. Klempt M. Hartmann M. Sorg C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9496-9502Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar), neutrophils also secreted the protein complex after activation of protein kinase C. The immunoprecipitation experiments of the cell supernatants revealed that (i) the secreted S100A8/A9 protein complex binds fatty acids and (ii) the majority of the simultaneously released AA was bound by the protein complex. Furthermore, the time courses of both AA release and S100A8/A9 secretion were found to be similar (Fig.6). In contrast, the stimulation with A23187 led to a rapid release of AA but not to secretion of S100A8/A9. Consequently, no significant amounts of radiolabeled fatty acids were determined in the immunoprecipitate. Still, the functional consequences of AA release either in the absence of S100A8/A9 secretion (as induced by calcium ionophore) or in parallel to S100A8/A9 secretion (as induced by PMA) remain unclear. The S100A8/A9 secretion from human neutrophils is also induced by the chemoattractants formylmethionylleucylphenylalanine and complement 5a (42Hetland G. Talgo G.J. Fagerhol M.K. Mol. Pathol. 1998; 51: 143-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), indicating that this mechanism is functional following receptor-dependent activation of cells.It is worth mentioning that apart from phosphorylation of S100A9, also oxidative modification of the protein complex by hypochlorite did not affect the AA binding capacity (TableII). The latter finding is of interest, since upon PMA stimulation the protein complex is secreted into an oxidative environment, and the proteins contain oxidative-sensitive cysteines. Additionally, it has been shown that oxidative modification affects the chemotactic activity of murine S100A8 (43Harrison C.A. Raftery M.J. Walsh J. Alewood P. Iismaa S.E. Thliveris S. Geczy C.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8561-8569Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). The monomeric and chemotactic S100A8 are transformed into nonchemotactic S100A8 homodimers by hypochlorite oxidation-driven disulfide linkage. The oxidation is suggested by the authors to provide a mechanism limiting excess infiltration of leukocytes and terminating the progression of acute inflammation. The analysis of the nature of the secreted AA-binding protein complex is currently under investigation in our laboratory.Table IIAA binding capacity of hypochlorite-treated S100A8/A9FractionBound [3H] AApmol/10 μg proteinS100A8/A9 In the absence of 5 mmCaCl20.6 ± 2.7 In the presence of 5 mm CaCl246.7 ± 4.7Hypochlorite-treated S100A8/A9 In the absence of 5 mm CaCl26.3 ± 4.9 In the presence of 5 mm CaCl243.6 ± 3.7Prior to the fatty acid binding assay, S100A8/A9 (1.2 mg/ml) was incubated with 100 μm hypochlorite for 10 min at 4 °C as described by Harrison et al. [43]. The proteins were separated from excess hypochlorite by gel filtration using PD10 columns. The proteins (10 μg) were incubated with 1 μm[3H] AA in the absence or presence of 5 mmcalcium, and the protein-bound fatty acids were separated from nonbound fatty acids using the Lipidex assay. The values represent the mean ± S.D. of three independent experiments with duplicate determinations. Open table in a new tab The S100A8/A9·AA complex may have an extracellular role. For example, it has been shown that endothelial cells utilize both endogenous and exogenous AA for transcellular production of thromboxane (44Karim S. Habib A. Levy-Toledano S. Maclouf J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12042-12048Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Therefore, it can be speculated that the AA thus liberated is taken up by bystander cells to be metabolized to eicosanoids, representing a particular transcellular pathway for AA metabolism. In addition, it has been shown that AA affects leukocyte adhesion by suppressing the expression of adhesion molecules on endothelial cells (45De Caterina R. Bernini W. Carluccio M.A. Liao J.K.

These actions may contribute to propagation of inflammatory processes, and the secreted AA-S100A8/A9 complex may here be involved, probably as the shuttle protein to reach target cells.Alternatively, S100A8/A9 represents the intracellular AA reservoir. It is likely that resting neutrophils (as well as other inflammatory cells) allow only relatively low concentrations of cellular AA to accumulate. The intracellular concentration of AA is under the control of various acyltransferases that rapidly incorporate the fatty acid into particular glycerolipids followed by a slower remodeling into other glycerolipids (for review, see Ref. 23Chilton F.H. Fonteh A.N. Surette M.E. Triggiani M. Winkler J.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1299: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). The mobilization of esterified AA from cellular sources and the subsequent metabolism of this AA into oxygen-containing metabolites (eicosanoids) is the key regulatory event in most inflammatory cells. Its mobilization is induced via phospholipase(s) by an increase of calcium or by protein phosphorylation through mitogen-activated protein kinases (for review, see Refs. 55Kudo I. Murakami M. Hara S. Inoue K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1170: 217-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar and 56Dennis E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13057-13060Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, the mechanism by which arachidonic acid as well as eicosanoids, once biosynthesized, leave the producer cell to reach their target cells is still poorly understood. In addition, arachidonic acid is liberated from cellular phospholipids, but the activities of the AA-metabolizing enzymes are detectable within hours after stimulation (57Niiro H. Otsuka T.

Immunopathol. 1998; 87: 304-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). This finding was confirmed by cell stimulation experiments. Both PMA and A23187 led to a time-dependent increase in the level of immunodetectable cyclooxygenase-2 (data not shown). In parallel, the enhanced calcium level also induces S100A8/A9 protein complex formation and its AA binding capacity. Thus, it could be envisioned either that the AA·S100A8/A9 complex may function as an intermediate reservoir or that the translocation of S100A8/A9 is accompanied by AA transport as suggested by Roulin et al. (37Roulin K. Hagens G. Hotz R. Saurat J.H. Veerkamp J.H. Siegenthaler G. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 247: 410-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Further investigations have to elucidate the exact nature of the protein complex which exhibits AA binding capacity as well as its role in the biological events caused by eicosanoids. They will provide further insights into the molecular mechanisms of inflammatory responses. The two myeloid-related proteins, MRP8 and MRP14, belong to the S100 family of calcium-binding proteins (for review, see Refs. 1Kligman D. Hilt D.C. Trends Biochem.

This calcitic biomaterial forms in a uterine fluid where the protein composition varies during the initial, calcification, and terminal phases of eggshell deposition.

Northern blotting and reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction demonstrated that the 2.35-kilobase message was expressed in a uterine-specific manner. The hypothetical translational product from the open reading frame corresponded to a novel 80-kDa protein, which we have named ovocleidin-116. After removal of the predicted signal peptide, its N-terminal sequence corresponded almost exactly with that determined from direct microsequencing of the 116-kDa uterine protein (this work) and with that previously determined for the core protein of a 120-kDa eggshell dermatan sulfate proteoglycan (Corrino, D.

Ultrastructural colloidal gold immunocytochemistry of ovocleidin-116 demonstrated its presence in the organic matrix, in small vesicles found throughout the mineralized palisade layer, and the calcium reserve assembly of the mammillary layer.

Osteopontin, also found in bone matrix, is an eggshell component, as are a number of egg white proteins (ovalbumin, ovotransferrin, and lysozyme) (5Pines M. Knopov V. Bar A.

One of these, ovocleidin-17, exhibits similarity in its N-terminal sequence to a variety of snake venom lectins and to the C-type lectin-like domain of certain proteoglycans (8Hincke M.T.

Hincke, manuscript in preparation.The proteins are initially secreted by epithelial and glandular cells into the uterine fluid, whose protein composition varies remarkably during the initial, active calcification and terminal phases of eggshell mineralization (9Gautron J. Hincke M.T. Nys Y. Connect. Tissue Res. 1997; 36: 195-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Sequential deposition of these matrix proteins into the forming eggshell results in their different localization patterns as the inner (mammillary) and outer (palisade) layers of the mineralized shell are assembled (10Hincke M.T.

Partially purified eggshell matrix and uterine fluid proteins can dramatically delay the precipitation of calcium carbonate from a metastable solution of calcium chloride and sodium bicarbonate (9Gautron J.

In addition, the carbohydrate moieties of dermatan sulfate and keratan sulfate proteoglycans have been demonstrated immunochemically in eggshell matrix (12Arias J.L. Carrino D.A. Fernandez M.S.

However, despite these studies, the direct roles for specific matrix components in eggshell formation remain undefined. There has been a lack of precise molecular detail regarding the uterine-specific eggshell matrix proteins, information that would allow comparisons with similar proteins in other calcifying tissues. In the present study, we report the cloning, characterization, and ultrastructural localization of a 116-kDa protein that is a major constituent of the uterine fluid during the calcification stage of shell formation. Furthermore, sequence comparisons reveal that it corresponds to the core protein of a unique, partially characterized dermatan sulfate proteoglycan that possesses little homology to proteoglycans previously isolated from bone or cartilage. Egg-laying hens (ISA BROWN) were housed individually in cages located in a windowless, air conditioned poultry house. They were subjected to a cycle of 14 h of light:10 h of darkness and were fed ad libitum on a layers' diet as recommended by the Institut National de la Recherche Agronomique (France). Cages were equipped with a computerized system to record the precise time of daily egg laying (oviposition). Ovulation was considered to occur 0.5 h after oviposition (11Gautron J. Bain M.M. Solomon S.E. Nys Y. Br. Poult. Sci. 1996; 37: 853-866Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Eggs were expelled with an intravenous injection of 50 μg/hen of prostaglandin (prostaglandin F2α) at 6–9 h (initial stage), 18–19 h (active calcification phase), and 22–23 h (terminal phase of shell calcification) after the preceding oviposition (11Gautron J. Bain M.M. Solomon S.E. Nys Y. Br. Poult. Sci. 1996; 37: 853-866Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Uterine fluid was collected immediately after the egg expulsion by gravimetry into a plastic test tube placed at the entrance of the everted vagina. Aliquots of uterine fluid were immediately diluted 1:1 in sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE)3 buffer (0.0625m Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 5% β-mercaptoethanol, 25% glycerol, 0.01% bromphenol blue). A portion of the fluid was kept to measure protein concentration, and the remainder was rapidly frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −20 °C. Protease inhibitors were used throughout all extraction procedures (17Termine J.D. Wientroub S. Fischer L.W. Dickson G.R. Methods of Calcified Tissue Preparation. Elsevier Science Publishers B.V., Amsterdam1984: 547-563Google Scholar). The first extraction protocol was based upon methods developed to extract matrix proteins from bone and cartilage (17Termine J.D. Wientroub S. Fischer L.W. Dickson G.R. Methods of Calcified Tissue Preparation. Elsevier Science Publishers B.V., Amsterdam1984: 547-563Google Scholar) and has been previously described (9Gautron J. Hincke M.T. Nys Y. Connect.

Briefly, eggshell powder was extracted with 4 m guanidine hydrochloride, 0.05m Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, for 4 days. The resulting supernatant was dialyzed, desalted, and then concentrated by ultrafiltration (Amicon Cell, cutoff 5 kDa). This soluble material is referred to as the extramineral eggshell extract. The pellet was demineralized with 0.5 m EDTA, 0.05 m Tris, pH 7.4, extracted with 4 m guanidine hydrochloride, 0.05 m Tris, pH 7.4, and then centrifuged. The resulting supernatant was desalted and concentrated as described above and is referred to as the intramineral eggshell extract. The second extraction protocol was an adaption of one previously published (13Fernandez M.S. Araya M. Arias J.L. Matrix Biol. 1997; 16: 13-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). A membrane extract was prepared by treating ground shell membranes with 4 m guanidine hydrochloride. The supernatant was desalted by dialysis and concentrated in an Amicon cell. This sample is referred to as the membrane extract. The ground shell was dialyzed against 50% acetic acid to demineralize. After further dialysis against demineralized water, the soluble material was concentrated as before and is referred to as the matrix soluble 1 fraction. The insoluble shell material was extracted as above for the membranes and is referred to as the matrix insoluble 1 fraction. Matrix proteins from tibiotarsal bones and from the upper proliferating zone of the cartilage growth plate of broiler chickens (4 weeks old) were extracted by established procedures (17Termine J.D. Wientroub S. Fischer L.W. Dickson G.R. Methods of Calcified Tissue Preparation. Elsevier Science Publishers B.V., Amsterdam1984: 547-563Google Scholar) and are referred to as cartilage- or bone-EDTA extracts. Laying hens were sacrificed 2–4 h or 16–17 h after oviposition. Various tissues (0.5–2 g of magnum, white and red isthmus, uterus, liver, kidney, duodenum, and muscle) were homogenized in 10 ml of Tris buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, 77 mm NaCl, pH 7.4, containing protease inhibitors). Homogenates were centrifuged (10,000 ×g, 30 min) before freezing in liquid nitrogen for storage at −20 °C. Blood was collected from the same birds just before sacrifice and centrifuged at 2500 × g to obtain a sample of plasma. The protein concentration of all samples and extracts was determined by a Pierce micromethod (18Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (211906) Google Scholar) using ovalbumin as the protein standard. Tissue samples were diluted 1:1 in SDS-PAGE buffer and boiled for 5 min before separation on gels. SDS-PAGE was performed on a 4–20% gradient gel (19Laemnli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205511) Google Scholar, 20Hames B.D. Rickwood D. Gel Electrophoresis of Proteins: A Practical Approach. IRL Press, Oxford1981Google Scholar). Proteins were stained with Coomassie Blue or electroblotted (0.8 mA/Cm2) for 1 h onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Hyperbond, Beckman) in 10 mm CAPS buffer, pH 11, 10% methanol for N-terminal amino acid microsequencing or to nitrocellulose membranes (Bio-Rad) in 25 mm Tris, 192 mm glycine, 10% methanol for Western blot analysis. Two preparative SDS-PAGE gradient gels (3 mm width) were prepared. About 8 mg of uterine fluid protein collected at the active phase of shell calcification were distributed into the sample lanes of both gels and electrophoresed. Gels were stained with Coomassie Blue, destained, and then thoroughly rinsed with demineralized water. The 116-kDa band was excised from both gels and ground to a fine powder with a Spex freezer mill. The powder was suspended in sterile 154 mm NaCl solution, mixed 1:1 with Freund's complete adjuvant, and injected into two rabbits. The animals were boosted after 3 weeks with the same antigen preparation in Freund's incomplete adjuvant. Animals were boosted 6 times to obtain a satisfactory titer. This antiserum is termed α-116. Proteins were electrotransferred to nitrocellulose membrane, which were washed in PBS-Tween (0.01m phosphate buffer, 0.0027 m potassium chloride, 0, 137 m sodium chloride, pH 7.4, Tween 20 0.1%), and then blocked for 1 h in 5% nonfat dry milk in PBS-Tween. The membranes were washed in PBS-Tween (2 × 5 min) and then incubated for 1.5 h with diluted antiserum (1:5000–1:10,000 in PBS-Tween, 1% bovine serum albumin). After 3 washes in PBS-Tween, the membranes were incubated for 1 h with 1:10,000 anti-rabbit Ig, peroxidase-linked species-specific whole antibody (NA 934, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) in PBS-Tween, 1% bovine serum albumin. Membranes were washed again (4 times) in PBS-Tween and then twice in PBS. The enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) method was used according to the manufacturer's instructions to reveal immunoreactive bands. Normal eggs from White Leghorn hens were cracked open and extensively washed with distilled water. Shell membranes were removed following brief treatment with 1 N HCl at room temperature as described previously (10Hincke M.T. Bernard A.-M. Lee E.R. Tsang C.P.W. Narbaitz R. Br. Poult.

The resulting suspension was centrifuged and dialyzedversus 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm2-mercaptoethanol, 0.05% NaN3 and loaded onto a previously equilibrated column of Trisacryl-DEAE. After washing the column extensively, all retained proteins were eluted with 250 ml of 1m NaCl in the equilibration buffer. This solution was applied to a column of hydroxyapatite (8 ml of resin) that had been previously equilibrated with 5 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.5, 250 mm NaCl, 1 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.05% NaN3. A linear gradient to 0.4 mpotassium phosphate was developed, which eluted 3 peaks (A 280). These were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and pooled for dialysis versus water and lyophilization. The second peak (fraction 27–35) contained ovocleidin-17 and osteopontin in addition to several other bands that were found by microsequencing to be derived from OC-116 (see Fig. 5). Sequencing was performed as described previously (8Hincke M.T. Tsang C.P.W. Courtney M. Hill V. Narbaitz R. Calcif. Tissue Int. 1995; 56: 578-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Proteins from uterine fluid sample (25 μg of protein) harvested from the calcification stage of shell formation were separated by SDS-PAGE on a 7% gel and then transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride (Bio-Rad Laboratories). Protein bands were visualized by Coomassie Blue staining. The 116-kDa band (which ran as 130 kDa on the 7% gel) was excised and washed extensively with sterile water. N-terminal microsequencing was performed at the Service de Sequence de Peptide de l'Est du Quebec, Laval, Quebec and revealed the following sequence: (T/V)PV(S/G)LPAR(A/I)(R/V)GN(D/C)PGQHQILLK. Pooled RNA was prepared by the guanidinium isothiocyanate extraction method (21Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (62898) Google Scholar) from shell gland mucosal tissue harvested at the middle phase of eggshell calcification from 4 White Leghorn hens. Messenger RNA was purified by affinity chromatography on oligo(dT)-Sepharose, and utilized to prepare a vector-ligated, directional bacteriophage cDNA library using the Stratagene ZAP-cDNA synthesis kit and Gigapack II packaging system exactly according to the manufacturer's protocols. The phage library was screened by standard methods using antiserum raised to the 116-kDa eggshell matrix protein (1/1000) and anti-rabbit IgG-alkaline phosphatase conjugate (1/3000) as a secondary antibody with nitro blue tetrazolium/5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate. Protein synthesis was induced with nitrocellulose circles (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech Hybond C) pretreated with 10 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. Phages with positive inserts were purified to homogeneity by three rounds of screening and rescued into Bluescript plasmid using helper phage, according to the kit instructions. Plasmid DNA was isolated by alkaline lysis miniprep, and the cDNA inserts were sequenced by automated protocols at the sequencing service, Station de Pathologie Aviaire et de Parasitologie, INRA-Center de Tours, Nouzilly, France. RNA was extracted from oviduct tissues harvested at different stages of eggshell calcification (2 birds/stage) (RNA InstaPure, Eurogentech). Northern blotting was performed by established methods (22Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) following migration of 15 μg of total RNA on a 1% agarose gel containing formaldehyde and transfer of RNA to Hybond N membrane. A BstEII restriction fragment (OC-116 nucleotides 234–959) was radiolabeled by random priming. Following overnight hybridization with this labeled probe at 42 °C, the membrane was washed (42 °C: 2× SSC, 0.1% SDS, 15 min; 0.5× SSC, 0.1% SDS, twice for 15 min; 55 °C: 0.5× SSC, 0.1% SDS). Labeled bands were visualized with x-ray film and quantified with a Storm PhosphorImager. Southern blotting of chicken genomic DNA (prepared from White Leghorn liver (22Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar)) digested with EcoRI and BamHI was also performed using the OC-116 BstEII restriction fragment as a probe. Reverse transcription was performed using random priming and Superscript II RNase H-reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies, Inc.). PCR primers to selectively amplify nucleotides 536–1227 had the following sequences: upper, 5′-TGGAGATGGCGATGGTG-3′; and lower, 5′-TGGCTGGAAGGCTATGC-3′. Samples of hen uterus and eggshell were fixed in aldehyde immediately after tissue harvest. These were washed, dehydrated in ethanol, and embedded in LR White acrylic resin as described previously (23McKee M.D. Nanci A. Microsc. Res. Tech. 1995; 31: 44-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Survey sections of embedded tissue were viewed by light microscopy, and selected regions were trimmed for thin sectioning and transmission electron microscopy. Grid-mounted tissue sections were processed for immunocytochemistry by incubation with primary antibodies, and immunolabeling patterns were visualized after conventional staining with uranyl acetate and lead citrate using protein A-colloidal gold complex (23McKee M.D. Nanci A. Microsc. Res. Tech. 1995; 31: 44-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Incubated grids were examined in a JEOL JEM 1200FX operated at 60 kV. Other samples of eggshell were fractured, critical-point dried, and examined at 3 kV in a JEOL JSM 6400V field emission scanning electron microscope. The protein composition of hen uterine fluid varies dramatically between the initial, active calcification and terminal stages of shell formation (Fig. 1). Particularly evident during the active calcification stage are bands at 180, 116, 66, 45, 36, 32, 21, and 14 kDa. In the present study, polyclonal antibodies were raised in rabbit toward the prominent 116-kDa protein. Western blotting with this antiserum showed immunoreactive bands of 180, 116, 66, and 45 kDa in uterine fluid only at this stage of shell calcification (Fig.2). Only eggshell matrix extracted by decalcification from the calcified shell (intramineral eggshell extract and matrix soluble 1 fraction) showed similar immunoreactive bands (Fig. 2). Western blot analysis revealed that the 180- and 116-kDa bands were only seen in extracts of uterine tissue and not in other regions of the oviduct or any other tissue (Fig.3). However, these bands could hardly be detected in uterine tissue harvested at the initial stage of shell formation (data not shown). No immunoreactivity was detected in intra- or extramineral extracts of cartilage or bone or in hen egg white (data not shown). These results suggested that the antiserum raised to the 116-kDa band recognized a protein that was specifically synthesized and secreted by the uterine cells during the active stage of eggshell calcification, which subsequently became incorporated into the calcifying matrix.Figure 2Western blotting to detect the 116-kDa protein in uterine fluid and eggshell extracts. Samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE and electrotransferred to nitrocellulose membrane (“Materials and Methods”). Primary antiserum raised to the 116-kDa protein was utilized at 1:5000 dilution. All samples were 20 μg of protein except uterine fluid (calcification, 17 μg; and terminal, 19 μg) and membranes (1.3 μg). Uterine fluid samples were harvested at different stages of eggshell formation: 1, initial; 2, active calcification; 3, terminal. Eggshell extract samples were as follows: 4, intramineral; 5, extramineral; 6, matrix soluble 1; 7, matrix soluble 2; 8, membranes. The calculated masses (kDa) of the immunoreactive bands in lane 2 are indicated on theleft (arrows).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Figure 3Western blotting to detect the 116-kDa protein in oviduct and other hen tissues. Extracts from different tissues (all 20 μg of protein) were subjected to SDS-PAGE and electrotransferred to nitrocellulose membrane (“Materials and Methods”). Primary antiserum raised to the 116-kDa protein was utilized at a 1:5000 dilution. Lanes were loaded as follows:1, magnum; 2, white isthmus; 3, red isthmus; 4, uterus; 5, plasma; 6,liver; 7, kidney; 8, duodenum; 9,muscle. Lane 10 contained molecular weight markers (Bio-Rad, prestained). The arrows indicate the immunoreactive bands seen only in the uterus (145–166 and 99–118 kDa).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To clone the coding sequences for the 116-/180-kDa immunoreactive bands, an expression screening approach was taken. A cDNA library prepared with mRNA purified from hen uterine tissue harvested at the midpoint of eggshell calcification was utilized. Expression screening this cDNA library with α-116 yielded a number of clones with inserts of variable length that differed in their 5′-sequence. These were assembled to produce a single composite cDNA sequence. In total, 24 independently purified clones were sequenced, two of which were full-length. All phage inserts that were immunoreactive with α-116 were derived from this sequence, confirming the specificity of the antiserum in this context. The total composite cDNA sequence was 2407 bases in length with a poly(A) tail. The total composite cDNA sequence is seen in Fig.4. No significant similarity was found with any nucleotide sequence in the NIH GenBank or EST data bases. 4The nucleotide sequence for ovocleidin-116 has been deposited in the GenBank data base under GenBank Accession numberAF148716. The context of the first start codon at nucleotide 24 is compatible with the Kozak consensus sequence for initiation of transcription in higher eukaryotes (24Kozak M. J.

Previously, we showed that SR-BI expression was associated with an increase in lipoprotein-stimulated cholesterol esterification in cells lacking LDL receptors (3Stangl H. Cao G. Wyne K.L. Hobbs H.H.

LDL and HDL were equally effective ligands for the SR-BI-dependent stimulation of cholesterol esterification within cells. Moreover, free cholesterol was a potent stimulus for the formation of cholesteryl esters in cells that express high levels of SR-BI. We did not define the chemical nature of the lipoprotein-associated lipid that was responsible for the SR-BI-dependent stimulation of esterification. In this study we determined the relative contributions of free cholesterol and cholesteryl esters to the formation of intracellular cholesteryl esters and examined the intracellular fate of these different lipids following uptake via SR-BI. We also examined the availability of the free cholesterol transferred to cells by SR-BI for efflux. Finally, the relative potency of HDL and LDL as donors to the intracellular cholesterol regulatory pool was determined. Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells that lack LDL receptor activity (ldlA7 cells) (18Kingsley D.M. Krieger M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

These cells have the advantage of allowing the analysis of the effect of SR-BI expression on lipid transport to cells from LDL that is independent of the LDL receptor. The cells were maintained in medium A (1:1 mixture of Dulbecco's minimal essential medium and Ham's F-12 medium with 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin sulfate), supplemented with 5% (v/v) fetal calf serum, and 0.25 mg/ml GeneticinTM (G418 sulfate, Life Technologies, Inc., Grand Island, NY). The cells were plated in 6-well plates at a cell density of 60,000 cells/well in medium A with 5% (v/v) fetal calf serum. On day 2, the cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and refed with medium A containing 5% (v/v) newborn calf lipoprotein-deficient serum, 10 μm compactin, and 100 μm mevalonate. On day 3 the cells were washed with PBS and switched to medium B (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (minus glutamine) with 2 mg/ml fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin). Human HDL (density (d) = 1.09–1.21 g/liter) and LDL (d = 1.04–1.063 g/liter) were prepared as described previously (19Chung B.H. Segrest J.P. Ray M.J. Brunzell J.D. Hokanson J.E. Krauss R.M. Beaudrie K. Cone J.T. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 128: 181Crossref PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar). The lipoproteins were iodinated using the iodine monochloride method (20Goldstein J.L. Basu S.K. Brown M.S. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 98: 241-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (1287) Google Scholar). The HDL and LDL were labeled by Celite exchange with either [3H]cholesteryl oleoyl ether (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), [3H]cholesteryl oleate (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), or [3H]cholesterol (NEN Life Science Products Inc.), as described (21Gwynne J.T. Mahaffee D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 8141-8150Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). On day 3 the cells were incubated in medium B plus varying concentrations of HDL or LDL. After a 5-h incubation with lipoproteins, the cells were pulsed with 0.2 mm [14C]oleate (∼10,000 dpm/nmol) (NEN Life Science Products Inc., Boston, MA) for 2 h. Then the cells were washed three times with buffer A (50 mm Tris, 0.9% NaCl, and 0.2% bovine serum albumin, pH 7.4), and once with buffer B (50 mm Tris and 0.9% NaCl, pH 7.4). The lipids were extracted twice from the cell monolayer with hexane:isopropyl alcohol (3:2) and analyzed by thin-layer chromatography (TLC) (Silica Gel G, Machete-Nagel, Dueren Federal Republic of Germany) (20Goldstein J.L. Basu S.K. Brown M.S. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 98: 241-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (1287) Google Scholar). The cells were lysed in 1 ml of 0.1 n NaOH and the protein was quantitated using the Lowry method (22Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 266: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). On day 3 the ldlA7 and ldlA7-SRBI cells were incubated with 125I-LDL or125I-HDL in medium B for the indicated time, the medium was removed and the proteins were precipitated using trichloroacetic acid. To remove the free iodine, the supernatant was oxidized with hydrogen peroxide and extracted with chloroform. The amount of radioactivity in the aqueous phase was quantitated on a γ-counter (Gamma Trac, Tm Analytic, Elk Grove Village, IL) to determine the amount of acid-soluble material formed by the cells (which is almost exclusively [125I]iodotyrosine) (20Goldstein J.L. Basu S.K. Brown M.S. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 98: 241-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (1287) Google Scholar). The degradation activity, representing the cell-dependent proteolysis, is expressed in micrograms of 125I-labeled acid-soluble protein formed per mg of total cell protein. On day 3 the media was changed to medium B and the cells were incubated with labeled lipoproteins for 5 h in the absence or presence of a 40-fold excess of unlabeled lipoprotein. The cells were chilled, washed 3 times with buffer A, and then once with buffer B. Lipids were extracted twice from the cell monolayer with 1 ml of hexane:isopropyl alcohol (3:2) and the lipid composition was analyzed using TLC (20Goldstein J.L. Basu S.K. Brown M.S.

The cells were then dissolved in 1 ml of 0.1 n NaOH and the protein was quantitated using the Lowry method (22Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol.

Membranes and nuclear extracts were prepared as described previously to assess the amount of 3-hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA (HMG-CoA) reductase (24Liscum L. Luskey K.L. Chin D.J. Ho Y.K. Goldstein J.L.

A total of 50 μg of membrane or nuclear protein was subjected to 6.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis prior to the transfer to nitrocellulose (Hybond C, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Immunoblotting was performed as described previously (27Landschulz K.T. Pathak R.K. Rigotti A. Krieger M. Hobbs H.H. J. Clin.

Bound antibodies were visualized by chemiluminescence with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse secondary antibody using the enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) system and exposed to Kodak DuPont NEF 496 film at room temperature for the indicated time. To determine the relative abilities of SR-BI to transport cholesterol and cholesteryl esters into cells via SR-BI, HDL and LDL particles were labeled with [3H]cholesterol or [3H]cholesteryl ester and incubated with mutant CHO cells that express no functional LDL receptors (ldlA7 cells) (18Kingsley D.M. Krieger M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 5454-5458Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar) and a line of permanently transfected ldlA7 cells that express high levels of recombinant mouse SR-BI (ldlA7-SRBI cells) (3Stangl H. Cao G. Wyne K.L. Hobbs H.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31002-31008Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). In the first experiment, the [3H]cholesterol-labeled lipoproteins were incubated with the cells for 5 h in the presence or absence of an inhibitor of acyl-coenzyme A:cholesteryl acyltransferase inhibitor (Sandoz 58-035). We added unlabeled 0.2 mm oleate to the cells for 2 h prior to extraction of the cellular lipids and analysis by TLC. Panels A–C of Fig.1 shows the amount of [3H]cholesterol associated with the ldlA7-SRBI and the control ldlA7 cells after the cells were incubated with the indicated amounts of radiolabeled HDL or LDL. An increase in the cellular content of [3H]cholesterol was seen with both lipoproteins, but only in the cells that express SR-BI. When the data were plotted on the basis of the protein content of lipoproteins, LDL appeared to be a more effective cholesterol donor than HDL (panel A), but if the data were plotted on the basis of the total cholesterol added, the two lipoproteins were relatively very similar (panel B). Addition of the acyl-coenzyme A:cholesteryl acyltransferase inhibitor did not significantly change the amount of radiolabeled cholesterol transferred to cells, except for a small reduction at the highest levels of LDL used in the assay. Addition of chloroquine also had no effect on the amount of [3H]cholesterol transferred to cells (data not shown). From these results, we conclude that the amount of cholesterol transferred from lipoproteins to cells is not dependent on the protein composition of the lipoprotein particle, but rather on the amount of lipoprotein cholesterol provided to the cells, and that inhibition of cholesterol esterification does not affect the cellular uptake of free cholesterol from lipoproteins via SR-BI. To determine the amount of [3H]cholesterol that was ultimately delivered to the ER and esterified, the amount of [3H]cholesteryl esters formed during the experiment was measured. A significant, although small, percentage (∼5%) of the total [3H]cholesterol delivered to cells was converted to [3H]cholesteryl esters (Fig. 1, panels D-F) in the cells expressing SR-BI. As expected, no [3H]cholesteryl esters were formed in the presence of the acyl-coenzyme A:cholesteryl acyltransferase inhibitor or chloroquine (3Stangl H. Cao G. Wyne K.L. Hobbs H.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31002-31008Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) (data not shown). These data indicate that only a small fraction of the cholesterol transferred from lipoproteins to cells via SR-BI was esterified. To determine if the cholesterol transferred to cells from lipoproteins via SR-BI is accessible for efflux, a time course experiment was performed in which the cells were incubated with lipoproteins labeled with [3H]cholesterol for up to 5 h, washed, and then unlabeled lipoproteins were added to the media (Fig.2). [14C]Oleate was present throughout the experiment to follow cholesterol esterification. The amount of [3H]cholesterol transferred to the cells expressing SR-BI increased progressively during the initial 5-h incubation, and then decreased with the addition of unlabeled lipoproteins (panel A). The media was subjected to ultracentrifugation and all of the [3H]cholesterol was associated with the lipoprotein fraction (data not shown). The LDL used in this experiment had a 4-fold higher cholesterol content than the HDL, which accounts for the greater amount of [3H]cholesterol transferred from LDL than HDL to cells during this experiment. Only a modest increase in cellular content of [3H]cholesterol was seen in the ldlA7 cells (panel B). Previous studies have shown that these cells express low but detectable levels of SR-BI (3Stangl H. Cao G. Wyne K.L. Hobbs H.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31002-31008Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). A modest increase in the cellular content of [3H]cholesterol that was not reversible was seen in the CHO cells (panel C), which contain a similar amount of SR-BI as the ldlA7 cells (data not shown) but also express LDL receptors. We next determined how much of the [3H]cholesterol that entered cells in this experiment was converted to [3H]cholesteryl esters (Fig. 2, panels D–F). In the ldlA7-SRBI cells, ∼5% of the [3H]cholesterol from HDL or LDL was esterified at the 5-h time point. A similar mass of cholesteryl esters was formed in the CHO cells, but this represented a much higher proportion of the free cholesterol that entered the cells (∼50%). Only a trace amount (<2%) of the HDL-associated [3H]cholesterol that entered CHO cells was esterified. The total amount of cholesteryl [14C]oleate formed during the experiment was monitored (Fig. 2, panels G–I) and proceeded in an unimpeded fashion in both the ldlA7-SRBI cells and CHO cells (panels G and I, respectively). LDL stimulated a dramatic increase in cholesterol esterification in CHO cells (panel I), which is consistent with the known re-esterification of LDL cholesterol delivered to the ER via the LDL receptor pathway (10Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Science. 1986; 232: 34-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (4383) Google Scholar). SR-BI not only mediates the transfer of free cholesterol between lipoproteins and cells, but also promotes the selective uptake of cholesteryl esters from HDL to cells (1Acton S. Rigotti A. Landschulz K.T. Xu S. Hobbs H.H. Krieger M. Science. 1996; 271: 518-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (2011) Google Scholar). To determine if LDL is as effective a donor of cholesteryl esters as HDL, we labeled the lipoprotein particles with [3H]cholesteryl oleoyl ether (which cannot be hydrolyzed) and incubated the radiolabeled lipoproteins with cells expressing recombinant SR-BI (Fig.3). A 4-fold greater amount of the [3H]cholesteryl oleoyl ether from HDL was associated with the ldlA7-SRBI cells than with the ldlA7 or CHO cells (Fig. 3,panel A), which is similar to what has been previously reported. As expected, when LDL was substituted for HDL in the experiment, the CHO cells had the greatest amount of cell-associated [3H]cholesteryl oleoyl ether. SR-BI overexpression was associated with an ∼2-fold increase in delivery of cholesteryl ethers from LDL to the cells (Fig. 3 B). To determine if the transfer of cholesteryl esters from LDL to cells occurs in the absence of lipoprotein degradation, we radiolabeled the protein component of HDL and LDL with radioactive iodine and the cholesteryl esters of the lipoproteins with tritium (Fig.4). Essentially no protein degradation was seen in the ldlA7 cells treated with HDL or LDL (panels A and B). As expected, a dose-dependent increase in lipoprotein degradation was seen when LDL, but not HDL, was added to the CHO cells. The cellular lipids were subjected to TLC to determine the fate of the lipoprotein-associated [3H]cholesteryl oleate (Fig. 4,panels C and D). Addition of radiolabeled HDL to the ldlA7-SRBI cells resulted in an increase in the cellular content of [3H]cholesteryl oleate, but no increase was seen in the ldlA7 or CHO cells (panel C). When radiolabeled LDL was used, the increase in cellular [3H]cholesteryl oleate was of similar magnitude in the ldlA7-SRBI cells and CHO cells (panel D). To determine if the [3H]cholesteryl oleate taken up from the HDL and LDL was hydrolyzed to [3H]cholesterol, we measured the cellular content of [3H]cholesterol (Fig. 4,panels E and F). In the ldlA7-SRBI cells incubated with radiolabeled HDL, more than 65% of the [3H]cholesterol that entered the cell was hydrolyzed to free cholesterol (panel E). A small but measurable increase in the cellular content of [3H]cholesterol was seen in the control ldlA7 cells, whereas almost no change was seen in CHO cells. In the ldlA7-SRBI and CHO cells, more than 70% of the radiolabeled cholesterol that entered the cells from LDL was in the free form. Almost all the [3H]cholesteryl oleate that entered the ldlA7 cells from LDL had undergone hydrolysis and was in the free form (panel F). The high cellular content of [3H]cholesterol in these cells was not due to the presence of an esterase in the lipoprotein particles, since TLC analysis of lipoprotein lipids revealed that greater than 98% of the radioactivity was cholesteryl ester. Thus, SR-BI transports cholesterol esters from both classes of lipoproteins but is significantly more efficient in delivering core hydrophobic lipids from HDL than from LDL. To determine how much of the cholesteryl ester that enters cells via SR-BI is hydrolyzed and then re-esterified, the experiments shown in Fig. 4 were repeated using HDL labeled with [3H]cholesteryl linoleate. The amount of [3H]cholesteryl oleate formed was determined by extracting the lipids from the cells and separated using Silica Gel 60 TLC plates impregnated with AgNO3 (23Cadigan K.M. Spillane D.M. Chang T.-Y. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 110: 295-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), which allows the separation of cholesteryl linoleate from cholesteryl oleate (Fig.5). In the ldlA7-SRBI cells, approximately 50% of the [3H]cholesteryl linoleate was hydrolyzed to [3H]cholesterol and only 5% was re-esterified to form cholesteryl oleate (panel C). To determine if the lipoprotein-associated lipids transported from HDL and LDL into cells via SR-BI have the same regulatory effects, we examined the effect of SR-BI expression on the level of immunodetectable HMG-CoA reductase (Fig.6 A) and the processing of SREBP-2 (Fig. 6 B) in response to addition of LDL and HDL with a similar cholesterol content. Two proteins with apparent molecular masses of 97 and 190 kDa were seen in most lanes (Fig.6 A), which represent the monomeric and dimeric forms of HMG-CoA reductase, respectively (29Liscum L. Finer-Moore J. Stroud R.M. Luskey K.L. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 522-530Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 30Cheng H.H. Zu L. Kumagai H. Simoni R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17171-17178Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 31Lawrence C.M. Rodwell V.W. Stauffacher C.V. Science. 1995; 268: 1758-1762Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). After addition of 10 μg/ml LDL, the level of immunodetectable HMG-CoA reductase did not change in either the ldlA7-SRBI or ldlA7 cells, but fell to very low levels in the CHO cells (Fig. 6 A). Addition of higher levels of LDL (100 μg/ml) resulted in a decrease in the level of HMG-CoA reductase in both the ldlA7-SRBI and CHO cells, but not the ldlA7 cells; when an equivalent amount of cholesterol was added as HDL (400 μg/ml), there was a similar decrease in the amount of HMG-CoA reductase in the ldlA7-SRBI cells. Thus, in the absence of LDL receptors and in the presence of very high levels of lipoproteins, SR-BI can transport sufficient cholesterol from LDL to the cholesterol regulatory compartment to down-regulate cholesterol-responsive genes. Addition of 25-hydroxycholesterol, which freely diffuses through the cell membrane, reduced the levels HMG-CoA reductase in all cells. In parallel dishes, the nuclei were isolated from the cells and the extracts were examined for the presence of the mature form of SREBP-2 (Fig. 6 B). In cholesterol-loaded cells, SREBP-2 is anchored to the ER membrane in a hairpin configuration (24Liscum L. Luskey K.L. Chin D.J. Ho Y.K. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 8450-8455Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26Sakai J. Duncan E.A. Rawson R.B. Hua X. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Cell. 1996; 85: 1037-1046Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar). Cholesterol depletion results in proteolytic processing of the protein and release of a ∼66-kDa, N-terminal fragment into the cytoplasm. This mature form of SREBP-2 then diffuses into the nucleus where it activates multiple cholesterol-regulated genes (26Sakai J. Duncan E.A. Rawson R.B. Hua X. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Cell. 1996; 85: 1037-1046Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar). Immunoblot analysis from the nuclear fractions from the three cell lines revealed a protein with an apparent molecular mass of ∼66 kDa, which represents the mature form of SREBP-2. A 56-kDa protein, which is a proteolytic product of the mature form of SREBP-2, was also present. A band of similar size has been previously observed when the nuclei are isolated from cells (26Sakai J. Duncan E.A. Rawson R.B. Hua X. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Cell. 1996; 85: 1037-1046Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar). The pattern of expression of the mature form of SREBP-2 in the ldlA7-SRBI, ldlA7, and CHO cells (Fig. 6 B) mirrored that which was seen for HMG-CoA reductase (Fig. 6 A). To determine if the time course of down-regulation of HMG-CoA reductase was similar when sterols were supplied to cells as HDL or LDL, equivalent amounts of cholesterol were provided to cells as a constituent of either lipoprotein (Fig.7). The level of HMG-CoA reductase began decreasing at 2 h and was almost undetectable at 8 h in the ldlA7-SRBI cells incubated with either LDL (100 μg/ml) or HDL (400 μg/ml) (Fig. 7). Thus, no lipoprotein class-specific differences were seen in the regulatory effects of SR-BI mediated uptake of sterols from HDL and LDL. No change in the level of HMG-CoA reductase was seen in the ldlA7 cells with the addition of lipoproteins, whereas in the CHO cells, the level of immunodetectable HMG-CoA reductase fell when LDL, but not HDL, was added to the media. As expected, treatment with 25-hydroxycholesterol decreased the levels of HMG-CoA reductase in all three cell lines, confirming that the integrity of the cholesterol regulatory machinery remained intact. No change in protein level was seen in the cells incubated without lipoproteins. In this paper we examined and compared the effect of the high level SR-BI expression on the transfer and fate of lipids from LDL and HDL to CHO cells. A new observation made in this paper is that SR-BI transferred more free cholesterol than cholesteryl esters to cells from either LDL or HDL. Almost all the lipoprotein-associated cholesterol that entered cells via SR-BI was available for efflux, which suggests that most of the cholesterol transferred to cells remains in the plasma membrane and/or in a freely accessible cholesterol pool. A small, but measurable fraction (∼5%) of the free cholesterol transferred to the cells in an SR-BI dependent fashion was delivered to the ER and esterified by acyl-coenzyme A:cholesteryl acyltransferase. We also showed that HDL was a more efficient donor of cholesteryl esters than LDL, although SR-BI was able to mediate the selective uptake of core lipids from both classes of lipoproteins. Over half of the transported cholesteryl esters were converted to free cholesterol, and ∼5% of this free cholesterol was re-esterified. Finally, sterols transported from LDL or HDL by SR-BI were equally effective in delivering cholesterol to the intracellular regulatory cholesterol pool, as revealed by inhibition of SREBP-2 processing and a reduction in HMG-CoA reductase protein mass. Previously we demonstrated that uptake of non-lipoprotein-associated cholesterol is enhanced by SR-BI expression (3Stangl H. Cao G. Wyne K.L. Hobbs H.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31002-31008Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). The current studies extend these results and show that SR-BI also mediates cellular uptake of free cholesterol from LDL and HDL. In CHO cells, most of the cholesterol remains in the plasma membrane and is readily available for efflux via SR-BI. Only a fraction of the free cholesterol that enters cells in a SR-BI-dependent manner is transported to the ER where it is available for esterification. The situation would be different in steroidogenic cells since most of the cholesterol transported into these cell types would be routed into the steroidogenic pathway. It has been shown that HDL cholesterol provides a greater proportion of the substrate for steroidogenesis in rat luteal cells than does HDL cholesteryl esters (32Rajan V.P. Menon K.M.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 959: 206-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 33Nestler J.E. Bamberger M. Rothblat G.H. Strauss III, J.F. Endocrinology. 1985; 117: 502-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). In the liver, it is likely that SR-BI is involved in the transport of free cholesterol from circulating lipoproteins into hepatocytes, and then into the bile (34Trigatti B. Rayburn H. Vinals M. Braun A. Miettinen H. Penman M. Hertz M. Schrenzel M. Amigo L. Rigotti A. Krieger M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 9322-9327Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar). In liver perfusion studies of African green monkeys, HDL cholesterol is more efficiently transported into bile than are HDL cholesteryl esters (35Scobey M.W. Johnson F.L. Rudel L.L. Gastrointest. Liver Physiol. 1989; 20: G644-G652Crossref Google Scholar). Unlike what we have observed in cultured cells, the cholesterol transferred from HDL to the bile may not enter the intra-hepatocyte regulatory pool but be transferred directly to the biliary system via the plasma membrane (36Robins S.J. Fasulo J.M. Hepatology. 1999; 29: 1541-1548Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). We and others have shown that SR-BI can mediate both the influx and efflux of cholesterol from cells to lipoproteins and other acceptors (2Ji Y. Jian B. Wang N. Sun Y. de la Llera Moya M.

Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5599-5606Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). Here we show that almost all of the free cholesterol delivered to cells via SR-BI is readily available for efflux, indicating that there is a constant bidirectional exchange of free cholesterol between cells and lipoproteins that is facilitated by SR-BI (Fig. 2). The direction of cholesterol flux between cells and lipoproteins is not concentration-dependent, since the concentration of lipoproteins was never changed during the experiment. Morrison et al. (38Morrison J.R. Silvestre M.J. Pittman R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13911-13918Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) showed that the rate of uptake of emulsion-associated unesterified cholesterol in a system free of membrane proteins or apolipoproteins is independent of acceptor concentration and so exhibits first-order kinetics, which is consistent with the results of our studies. Inhibition of esterification had no measurable effect on the amount of cholesterol transported from lipoproteins to cells (Fig. 1). Therefore, the transport of cholesterol at the cell surface does not reflect changes in the cholesterol content of the ER. The cholesterol exchange that is mediated by SR-BI is not affected by the inhibition of lysosomal transport by chloroquine. These data are consistent with previous findings that lysosomotropic agents do not affect the utilization of HDL-associated free or esterified cholesterol for steroidogenesis (33Nestler J.E. Bamberger M. Rothblat G.H. Strauss III, J.F. Endocrinology. 1985; 117: 502-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). SR-BI expression was associated with the selective transport of cholesteryl esters from LDL as well as HDL. The LDL used in these studies did not contain any immunodetectable apoA-I (data not shown), which indicates that apoA-I is not required for efficient SR-BI mediated transfer of cholesterol to cells. The finding that SR-BI can mediate the selective uptake of cholesteryl esters from LDL is consistent with the observations of Reaven et al. (9Reaven E. Tsai L. Azhar S. J. Lipid Res. 1995; 36: 1602-1617Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) who showed that 20% of the LDL cholesteryl ether delivered to cAMP-stimulated granulosa cells is taken up by a selective mechanism and that the stimulation of rat granulosa cells with cAMP resulted in a proportionally greater increase in the selective uptake of cholesteryl esters than whole lipoprotein particle uptake of LDL (8Azhar S. Tsai L. Reaven E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1047: 148-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). An unexpected finding was the relatively large amount of [3H]cholesteryl oleoyl ether associated with the ldlA7 cells when it was provided as a constituent of LDL but not HDL (Fig.3). Similar results were obtained when cells were incubated with LDL in which the cholesteryl esters were labeled (see Fig. 4). The LDL cholesteryl ether particles do not nonspecifically adsorb to the surface of the ldlA7 cells since only very low levels of cell-associated radioactivity were seen when ldlA7 cells are incubated with 125I-LDL particles under identical conditions (data not shown). Multiple methodologies were used to label the LDL (Celite exchange, dimethyl sulfoxide-assisted labeling or particle reconstitution) and identical results were obtained (data not shown). It is possible that another nonspecific pathway is operative that accounts for the observed association of LDL-derived cholesteryl esters in these cells. Cholesteryl esters were more efficiently transferred from HDL to cells than from LDL. The greater efficiency of HDL may be explained by the smaller size of the HDL particles and the resultant lower diffusion barrier (38Morrison J.R. Silvestre M.J. Pittman R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13911-13918Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These physical characteristics serve to increase the probability that the HDL particle will have intimate contact with the cell membrane during collision events. It is also possible that other factors, such as the composition and packing of the phospholipid molecules on the HDL surface may influence lipid transfer. Here we show that cholesterol delivered to cells via SR-BI has important regulatory effects on genes and proteins involved in cholesterol metabolism. Cholesterol delivered to cells via SR-BI from both HDL and LDL down-regulated HMG-CoA reductase and inhibited SREBP-2 processing. The in vivo role of SR-BI in the transport of lipids from apoB- and apoE-containing lipoproteins is less clear than that for HDL since most cells in the body express LDL receptors, which is the major pathway by which these lipoproteins are removed from the plasma. Fielding et al. (39Fielding C.J. Fielding P.E. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 14237-14244Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) have shown that free cholesterol is selectively transferred from LDL to fibroblasts that have been cultured in media containing human plasma, which down-regulates the LDL receptor pathway (39Fielding C.J. Fielding P.E. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 14237-14244Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 40Fielding C.J. Fielding P.E. J. Lipid Res. 1997; 38: 1503-1521Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). SR-BI may contribute to the LDL receptor-independent pathway of LDL cholesterol uptake by some tissues.

We have identified a partial cDNA encoding the 240-kDa vault protein and determined it is identical to the mammalian telomerase-associated component, TEP1. TEP1 is the mammalian homolog of the Tetrahymena p80 telomerase protein and has been shown to interact specifically with mammalian telomerase RNA and the catalytic protein subunit hTERT. We show that while TEP1 is a component of the vault particle, vaults have no detectable telomerase activity. Using a yeast three-hybrid assay we demonstrate that several of the human vRNAs interact in a sequence-specific manner with TEP1. The presence of 16 WD40 repeats in the carboxyl terminus of the TEP1 protein is a convenient number for this protein to serve a structural or organizing role in the vault, a particle with eight-fold symmetry. The sharing of the TEP1 protein between vaults and telomerase suggests that TEP1 may play a common role in some aspect of ribonucleoprotein structure, function, or assembly.

Its cDNA has been cloned from human, rat,Dictyostelium, and Discopyge ommata electric ray and their sequences are highly conserved both at the gene and protein level (4Scheffer G.L. Wijngaard P.L. Flens M.J. Izquierdo M.A. Slovak M.L. Pinedo H.M. Meijer C.J. Clevers H.C. Scheper R.J. Nat. Med. 1995; 1: 578-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (580) Google Scholar, 5Kickhoefer V.A. Rome L.H.

Gene. 1997; 188: 85-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Likewise vault-associated RNA (vRNA) has been cloned from human, rat, mouse and bullfrog (9Kickhoefer V.A. Searles R.P.

Rome L.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8971-8974Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). vRNAs exhibit species-specific length variation ranging from 86 to 141 bases; however, all of the vRNAs can be folded into a similar secondary structure. Furthermore, vRNA is not a structural component of the vault particle as it makes up <5% of the vault mass, and its degradation does not result in the alteration of vault structure (1Kedersha N.L. Heuser J.E. Chugani D.C. Rome L.H. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 112: 225-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). All mammalian vaults contain two higher molecular weight vault proteins, p193 and p240. Recently, we have identified the p193 by its interaction with the MVP in a yeast two-hybrid screen and confirmed its identity by peptide sequence analysis (11Kickhoefer V.A. Siva A.C. Kedersha N.L. Inman E.M. Ruland C. Streuli M. Rome L.H. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 917-928Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). Vaults have a unique barrel shape that is made up of two halves with each half vault capable of opening into a flower-like structure with eight petals surrounding a central ring. Each petal is formed by six copies of MVP, with 96 copies of MVP in the complete vault particle. Vaults are widely distributed throughout eukaryotes, and their morphology is highly conserved among these species, suggesting that their function is essential (12Kedersha N.L. Miquel M.C. Bittner D. Rome L.H. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 110: 895-901Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Although the function of the vault particle has remained elusive, a portion of vaults have been localized to the cytoplasmic face of the nuclear membrane at or near nuclear pore complexes (13Chugani D.C. Rome L.H. Kedersha N.L. J. Cell Sci. 1993; 106: 23-29Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, vault particle mass and symmetry are strikingly similar to the predicted mass of the putative central plug of the nuclear pore complex, leading to the proposal that vaults participate in nuclear-cytoplasmic transport (13Chugani D.C. Rome L.H. Kedersha N.L. J. Cell Sci. 1993; 106: 23-29Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, a reconstruction of the vault has been completed to 31-Å resolution indicating the hollow nature of the vault particle, consistent with a carrier/sequestration function (14Kong L.B. Siva A.C. Rome L.H. Stewart P.L. Struct. Fold. Design. 1999; 7: 371-379Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (120) Google Scholar). In support of this hypothesis, it has recently been discovered that, in response to estrogen, the estrogen receptor is found associated with vaults in a nuclear extract (15Abbondanza C. Rossi V. Roscigno A. Gallo L. Belsito A. Piluso G. Medici N. Nigro V. Molinari A.M. Moncharmont B. Puca G.A. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 1301-1310Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Furthermore sea urchin vaults have been shown to localize to the nucleus and nucleolus in adult coelomocytes, the invertebrate equivalent of a macrophage (16Hamill D.R. Suprenant K.A. Dev. Biol. 1997; 190: 117-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Vaults have also been determined to be up-regulated in some multidrug-resistant (MDR) cell lines, and one way vaults may function in MDR may be by regulating the amount of drug that reaches the nucleus (4Scheffer G.L. Wijngaard P.L. Flens M.J. Izquierdo M.A. Slovak M.L. Pinedo H.M. Meijer C.J. Clevers H.C. Scheper R.J. Nat. Med. 1995; 1: 578-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (580) Google Scholar, 10Kickhoefer V.A.

In Torpedo electric ray, high levels of vaults are found in the electric lobe that contains the cholinergic electromotor neurons innervating the electric organ (17Herrmann C. Volknandt W. Wittich B. Kellner R. Zimmermann H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13908-13915Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Vaults are localized in cholinergic nerve terminals in close proximity to synaptic vesicles. Thus, vaults are highly enriched in the electromotor system of electric rays where they are transported to the nerve terminal possibly along microtubules (18Herrmann C. Golkaramnay E. Inman E. Rome L. Volknandt W. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 1163-1172Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Here we demonstrate a direct connection between vaults and a well studied nuclear enzyme complex, telomerase. To complete our characterization of the protein components of vaults, we focused our attention on the higher molecular weight vault proteins, p193 and p240. Here we describe the identification of p240 as the mammalian telomerase-associated protein, TEP1. We demonstrate that TEP1 associates with vaults in biochemical fractionations and by immunoprecipitation analysis. In addition, we show that purified vaults do not have telomerase activity using the telomere repeat amplification (TRAP) assay. Using the yeast three-hybrid system, we show that several of the human vault RNAs interact with mouse TEP1 in a sequence-specific manner. The sharing of the TEP1 protein between two seemingly unrelated RNPs suggests that TEP1 may play a common role in some aspect of ribonucleoprotein structure, function, or assembly. Vaults were purified from monkey liver as described (14Kong L.B. Siva A.C. Rome L.H. Stewart P.L. Struct. Fold. Design. 1999; 7: 371-379Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 19Kedersha N.L. Rome L.H. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 103: 699-709Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). Purified vaults were fractionated onto four 6% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and stained with copper, and the appropriate bands were excised. An estimated 24 pmol of the 240-kDa vault protein was sent to William S. Lane at the Harvard Microchemistry Facility. Peptide sequences were determined on a Finnigan TSQ-7000 Triple Quadrapole Mass Spectrometer with some residues being confirmed by Edman chemistry. HeLa cell extracts (S100 and P100) and discontinuous sucrose gradient fractionation of the P100 extracts were carried out as described (10Kickhoefer V.A. Rajavel K.S. Scheffer G.L. Dalton W.S. Scheper R.J. Rome L.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8971-8974Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). The 100,000 ×g pellet was resuspended by Dounce homogenization with a B pestle. Both S100 and P100 extracts and P100/sucrose gradient fractions were resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to Hybond membrane (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The equivalent of 2 × 106 cells were present in each lane of the S100 and P100 extract. Each of the sucrose gradient fractions also represented 2 × 106 cells. The membrane was incubated with 0.1 μg/ml affinity purified anti-TEP1 or a 1:500 dilution of affinity purified anti-vault antibody, followed by a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody and visualized by ECL (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). For Northern analysis, equivalent aliquots of each of the sucrose gradient fractions were extracted for RNA and analyzed as described previously (10Kickhoefer V.A. Rajavel K.S. Scheffer G.L. Dalton W.S. Scheper R.J. Rome L.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8971-8974Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). For immunoprecipitation from S100 and P100 extracts equivalent amounts of protein (∼800 μg) were incubated with the following affinity purified antisera, anti-TEP1, anti-p240, or anti-vault for 2 h at 4 °C. Protein A-Sepharose beads were added and further incubated for 2 h at 4 °C. The beads were washed three times with buffer A (50 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.4), 1.5 mm MgCl2, 75 mm NaCl) containing 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm DTT, and protease inhibitors and three times in phosphate-buffered saline. Precipitates were analyzed by immunoblotting (see above). The specificity of the polyclonal anti-TEP1 antisera was described previously (25Harrington L. Zhou W. McPhail T. Oulton R. Yeung D.S. Mar V. Bass M.B. Robinson M.O. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 3109-3115Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar). Polyclonal anti-vault antisera were generated by injection of highly purified vaults into a rabbit as described previously (19Kedersha N.L. Rome L.H. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 103: 699-709Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). A fragment of p240 (amino acids 191–441) was expressed in the pET expression system (Novagen). The protein was purified on a His-bind column and injected into a rabbit. A p240 (191–441) containing glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion protein was coupled to Affi-Gel 15 resin (Bio-Rad) to make an affinity column. Polyclonal antisera were affinity purified and used at 1:250 on Western blots. Telomerase activity in purified vaults, S100, P100, and P100/sucrose gradient fractions was determined using the TRAP assay. The TRAPeze Telomerase Detection Kit (Intergen) was used as described by the manufacturer. About 10,000 cell equivalents of cellular extracts were examined. Telomerase extension was for 30 min at 30 °C, and extended products were amplified by a two-step PCR (94 °C for 30 s, 59 °C for 30 s) for 22 cycles. Products were separated on 12.5% polyacrylamide gels and exposed to PhosphorImager screens (Molecular Dynamics). Because of the presence of a PCR inhibitor, telomerase extension of purified vaults (3 μg) was followed by phenol:chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation. The precipitated “extended” products were amplified and analyzed as described above. Human vRNA genes (hvg1–4) were amplified by PCR. Digested, gel-purified PCR products were subcloned into the SmaI site in pMS2–1 downstream of the MS2 RNA (21SenGupta D. Zhang B. Kraemer B. Pochart P. Fields S. Wickens M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 8496-8501Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar). After sequence analysis theMS2-hvg (sense and antisense) hybrid genes were subcloned into pIIIEx426, a yeast expression vector (22Good P.D. Engelke D.R. Gene (Amst.). 1994; 151: 209-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). All other plasmids used, and the methods used in Fig. 5, are described in Ref. 20Harrington L. McPhail T. Mar V. Zhou W. Oulton R. Bass M.B. Arruda I. Robinson M.O. Science. 1997; 275: 973-977Crossref PubMed Scopus (630) Google Scholar. To identify and characterize the vault proteins, p193 and p240 (formerly referred to as p210), highly purified vaults from monkey liver were fractionated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and stained, and the appropriate gel bands (p240) were excised and submitted to the Harvard Microchemistry Facility for peptide sequence analysis. Initially two peptide sequences were obtained (NQCLATLPD(I/L)K and FAQFDEYQLAK) and determined to be unique in a TBLASTN search of the nonredundant nucleotide sequence data base. A human cDNA library (kindly provided by Dr. Owen Witte, HHMI, UCLA) was screened with a 512-fold degenerate oligonucleotide to FAQFDEYQ. One clone of about 4 kb was identified and sequenced. A later BLAST search revealed that the p240 open reading frame sequence was identical to a newly identified human TEP1 sequence (initially identified as TP1 GenBankTMaccession number U86136 (20Harrington L. McPhail T. Mar V. Zhou W. Oulton R. Bass M.B. Arruda I. Robinson M.O. Science. 1997; 275: 973-977Crossref PubMed Scopus (630) Google Scholar)). Interestingly, sequence alignment of our truncated p240 open reading frame with TEP1 revealed the presence of a 1.5-kb intron in our clone at nucleotide 646 based on the TEP1 sequence. Similarly, the EST clone (H33937) encoding a portion of the rat TEP1 sequence was determined to contain an intron (23Nakayama J. Saito M. Nakamura H. Matsuura A. Ishikawa F. Cell. 1997; 88: 875-884Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). Importantly, when we spliced out the 1.5-kb intron from our p240 clone, the remaining 2.5-kb open reading frame sequence was identical to that determined for the 5′-end of TEP1. Alignment of the p240 peptide sequences against the human TEP1 revealed the peptide locations to be amino acids 49 to 59 and 369 to 379. To exclude the possibility that only the amino-terminal portion of p240 was related to TEP1, further peptide sequence analysis of the p240 vault protein was carried out. This resulted in a peptide that aligned perfectly with amino acids 2553 to 2573 of TEP1 near the carboxyl terminus, confirming that p240 and TEP1 were identical. To establish that this telomerase-associated subunit was indeed a vault particle component, vaults purified from rat liver were examined by immunoblot analysis. An anti-TEP1 antisera (25Harrington L. Zhou W. McPhail T. Oulton R. Yeung D.S. Mar V. Bass M.B. Robinson M.O. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 3109-3115Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar) recognized the p240 vault protein confirming its association with vaults, Fig.1 A. Previous studies using indirect immunofluorescence of vaults in fibroblast cells revealed a punctate cytoplasmic distribution, with subpopulations of vaults localized to the lamellopodia in freshly plated cells and at the tips of actin stress fibers (24Kedersha N.L. Rome L.H. Mol. Biol. Rep. 1990; 14: 121-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). In subcellular fractions of HeLa cells, vaults are purified from the 100,000 × g microsomal pellet (P100 (10Kickhoefer V.A. Rajavel K.S. Scheffer G.L. Dalton W.S. Scheper R.J. Rome L.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8971-8974Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar, 19Kedersha N.L. Rome L.H. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 103: 699-709Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar)). In contrast, most telomerase assays are routinely performed on the 100,000 × g supernatant (S100) fraction. To determine where TEP1 fractionates, HeLa cells were fractionated into S100 and P100 extracts and analyzed by immunoblotting. TEP1 is present in both S100 and P100 fractions (Fig.1 B, top panel, lanes 1 and2). Further fractionation of the P100 extract on a discontinuous sucrose gradient revealed that the majority of the TEP1 is found in the 40/45% sucrose layer, coincident with the pattern observed for the major vault protein (MVP, Fig.1 B, both panels, lanes 5 and6). These results suggest that the majority of the TEP1 in the P100 fraction is co-fractionating with the vault particle. We have generated polyclonal anti-p240 antisera from a bacterially expressed fragment of the p240 (amino acids 191–441, see “Experimental Procedures”). The anti-p240 antisera recognized a single protein species of 240 kDa in P100 extracts from HeLa cells (Fig. 2 A) and in vitro translated recombinant TEP1 by immunoprecipitation analysis (data not shown). To further analyze the association of TEP1 with the vault particle, S100 and P100 extracts were immunoprecipitated using anti-vault, anti-p240, and anti-TEP1 antibodies, followed by immunoblot analysis with anti-TEP1 antisera. Immunoprecipitates from P100 extracts with an anti-vault antibody contain a 240-kDa protein recognized by the anti-TEP1 antisera (Fig. 2 B, lane 4). In contrast, immunoprecipitates from S100 extracts with an anti-vault antibody did not contain a 240-kDa protein (Fig. 2 B,lane 8). As expected, immunoprecipitates from both S100 and P100 with anti-TEP1 and anti-p240 antisera contain a 240-kDa protein (Fig. 2 B, lanes 2, 3, 6, and 7). Using the anti-vault, anti-TEP1, and anti-p240 antibodies, about equal amounts of the TEP1 protein are immunoprecipitated from the P100 extract (Fig. 2 B,lanes 2–4). Our data indicate that the majority of the TEP1 in the P100 associates with the vault particle. Like telomerase, vaults are associated with a small RNA. In humans, there are multiple related vRNAs that vary from 86 to 99 bases in length. Four members of the human vRNA gene family have been identified to date; hvg1is 96 bases, hvg2 and 3 are 86 bases in length (10Kickhoefer V.A. Rajavel K.S. Scheffer G.L. Dalton W.S. Scheper R.J. Rome L.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8971-8974Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar), and hvg4 is 99 bases in length. hvg4was identified by a search of the nonredundant nucleotide sequence data base and is located on chromosome X. We have determined that both hvg1 and hvg4 consistently copurify with vaults as evidenced by pelleting at 100,000 × g and are present in all cell types examined. By contrast, the related vRNAs hvg2 and/or hvg3 are not present in all cell types examined, and when present they do not consistently pellet at 100,000 × g with vaults (10Kickhoefer V.A. Rajavel K.S. Scheffer G.L. Dalton W.S. Scheper R.J. Rome L.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8971-8974Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). However, all of the human vRNAs appear to be present in S100 extracts. To determine whether the vRNAs and telomerase RNA (hTER) co-fractionate, total RNA was extracted from the S100, P100, and P100/sucrose gradient fractions and examined by Northern analysis. Like the vault proteins, the majority of the vault-associated RNAs (hvg1 and hvg4) are found in the 40/45% sucrose gradient fractions (Fig.3 A, bottom panel). However, significant amounts of all of the human vault RNAs are found in the S100. In contrast, the telomerase RNA fractionated throughout the sucrose gradient, with a slight peak in the 30% fraction (Fig.3 A, top panel). We next examined these fractions for telomerase activity using the TRAP assay (Fig. 3 B). Telomerase activity was present in both the P100 and most of the P100/sucrose gradient fractions, suggesting that active telomerase complexes of varying size are present in these fractions and that they occasionally co-fractionate with vaults. Because telomerase activity partly cosedimented with vault particles in this partial purification, we next determined whether telomerase activity was also associated with highly purified vault particle preparations. Using the TRAP assay, we determined that purified vaults have no detectable telomerase activity (Fig. 4).Figure 4Vaults do not have telomerase activity. TRAP assays were performed on highly purified vaults from rat liver (3 μg). The telomerase positive cells and TSR8 controls were supplied with the TRAPeze kit (Intergen). The telomerase positive control corresponds to the activity present in 500 cells.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Mouse TEP1 has been shown to interact with mouse telomerase RNA (mTER) using a yeast three-hybrid assay (20Harrington L. McPhail T. Mar V. Zhou W. Oulton R. Bass M.B. Arruda I. Robinson M.O. Science. 1997; 275: 973-977Crossref PubMed Scopus (630) Google Scholar). In this assay, the RNA of interest is fused to the hairpin RNA sequence of phage MS2 where transcriptional activation of thelacZ gene is mediated through a protein-RNA hybrid-protein interaction with the MS2 coat protein (21SenGupta D. Zhang B. Kraemer B. Pochart P. Fields S. Wickens M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 8496-8501Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar). Preliminary experiments indicated that the rat vRNA can be UV cross-linked in purified vaults to both the p193 and p240 vault proteins. 2V. Kickhoefer and L. Rome, unpublished data. Using the yeast three-hybrid assay we have determined that the human vRNAs interact with TEP1 in a sequence-specific manner when cloned downstream of the MS2 RNA (Fig. 5). Coexpression of mTEP1 and the human vault RNAs (hvg1, hvg2, and hvg4) resulted in strong activation of the reporter genes HIS3 and lacZand allowed growth on 3-aminotrizole medium and detection of β-galactosidase activity (Fig. 5, A and B). TEP1 also interacted with mTER but not with several control RNAs such as Drosophila tRNAarg, and antisense hvg1, hvg2, or hvg4 (Fig. 5 A). Both sense and antisense hvg3 interacted with TEP1, therefore we could not determine whether the interaction of hvg3 with TEP1 was specific (data not shown). This assay indicates that mTER and three of the human vault RNAs specifically interact with TEP1. Because the three-hybrid assay cannot be used to examine binding of more than one RNA at a time, in vitro RNA-protein binding experiments will be required to determine whether the binding of hvg RNA and telomerase RNA compete for recognition by TEP1. We have cloned the cDNA encoding the 240-kDa vault protein based on peptide sequence obtained from purified protein and determined it is identical to the telomerase-associated protein, TEP1. Co-immunoprecipitation and subcellular fractionation, demonstrate that TEP1 is associated with the purified vault particle. The TEP1 protein contains a number of interesting domains including an amino-terminal repeat domain, an RNA binding domain, an ATP/GTP binding motif, and 16 WD40 repeats in the carboxyl terminus (20Harrington L. McPhail T. Mar V. Zhou W. Oulton R. Bass M.B. Arruda I. Robinson M.O. Science. 1997; 275: 973-977Crossref PubMed Scopus (630) Google Scholar, 23Nakayama J. Saito M. Nakamura H. Matsuura A. Ishikawa F. Cell. 1997; 88: 875-884Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). We also demonstrate that purified vaults have no apparent telomerase activity and that several of the human vRNAs are capable of interacting with TEP1 in a yeast three-hybrid assay. The basis for the sharing of this protein between vaults and telomerase is unclear. It is tempting to speculate that the TEP1 protein may be acting as a chaperone aiding in the assembly of vault particles and possibly in the assembly of telomerase complexes. The role of TEP1 in the telomerase complex has not yet been defined (20Harrington L. McPhail T. Mar V. Zhou W. Oulton R. Bass M.B. Arruda I. Robinson M.O. Science. 1997; 275: 973-977Crossref PubMed Scopus (630) Google Scholar, 23Nakayama J. Saito M. Nakamura H. Matsuura A. Ishikawa F. Cell. 1997; 88: 875-884Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). However, immunoprecipitates of TEP1 have been shown to contain telomerase activity and TEP1 associates with TERT and hTER in cell lysates (20Harrington L. McPhail T. Mar V. Zhou W. Oulton R. Bass M.B. Arruda I. Robinson M.O. Science. 1997; 275: 973-977Crossref PubMed Scopus (630) Google Scholar, 23Nakayama J. Saito M. Nakamura H. Matsuura A. Ishikawa F.

The exact role of TEP1 in the telomerase complex is unclear, as telomerase activity can be reconstituted in vitro with just TERT and hTER (27Beattie T.L. Zhou W. Robinson M.O. Harrington L. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 177-180Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar, 28Weinrich S.L. Pruzan R. Ma L. Ouellette M. Tesmer V.M. Holt S.E. Bodnar A.G. Lichtsteiner S. Kim N.W.

As the minimal telomerase complex does not appear to be dependent on the presence of TEP1, perhaps it has a more general role in telomerase complex assembly. Possibly the binding of TEP1 to a specific RNA is what determines whether it associates with vaults or telomerasein vivo. Using a yeast three-hybrid system, murine TEP1 has been shown to interact specifically with mTER (20Harrington L. McPhail T. Mar V. Zhou W. Oulton R. Bass M.B. Arruda I. Robinson M.O. Science. 1997; 275: 973-977Crossref PubMed Scopus (630) Google Scholar). Similarly, we demonstrate that several of the human vRNAs (hvg1, hvg2, and hvg4) specifically interact with TEP1 in a three-hybrid assay. More direct binding experiments will be required to determine whether the binding sites for the telomerase RNA overlaps or is distinct from the binding site for human vRNAs. TEP1 may also have a role in protecting the RNAs from degradation, thus maintaining an available pool of TEP1/TER or TEP1/vRNA for future assembly into either complex. It is also possible that TEP1/TER might have additional functions since both are present in cells that do not possess telomerase activity (data not shown). The presence of the 16 WD40 repeats in TEP1 is a convenient number for this protein to serve a structural or organizing role in the vault, a particle with 8-fold symmetry. Heterotrimeric G proteins containing seven WD40 repeats have been shown to form a seven-blade propeller-like structure (30Lambright D.G. Sondek J. Bohm A. Skiba N.P. Hamm H.E. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1996; 379: 311-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (1051) Google Scholar). Evidence from cryoelectron microscopy and stoichiometry calculations suggests that the 96 copies of the MVP form the barrel of the vault particle and that the barrel is hollow (14Kong L.B. Siva A.C. Rome L.H. Stewart P.L. Struct. Fold. Design. 1999; 7: 371-379Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (120) Google Scholar). The stoichiometry of the two higher molecular weight vault proteins is more difficult to predict from mass and cryoelectron microscopy data. Yeast two-hybrid analysis indicates that MVP interacts with the 193-kDa vault protein (11Kickhoefer V.A. Siva A.C. Kedersha N.L. Inman E.M. Ruland C. Streuli M. Rome L.H. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 917-928Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). We suggest that the potential 8-fold symmetry of the TEP1 WD40 repeats could support a role for TEP1 in the elaboration of the vault particle structural symmetry, possibly at the ends of the vault particle. Although the function of the vault particle is not yet known, the sharing of the TEP1 protein with telomerase may aid in elucidating vault function. The sharing of protein subunits is not a new finding, and several examples have been identified (for review, see Ref. 31Jeffery C.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 8-11Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (872) Google Scholar). Cytosolic aconitase and the iron regulatory binding protein have been shown to be the exact same protein with two mutually exclusive functions that are regulated by cellular iron levels (32Philpott C.C. Klausner R.D. Rouault T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 7321-7325Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). When cellular iron levels are high, the protein binds iron-sulfur clusters and acts as a cytosolic aconitase converting citrate to isocitrate. However, when iron stores are low, the protein is no longer able to bind iron and subsequently acts as an RNA binding protein, binding to the IRE element upstream of ferritin thus translationally regulating the iron storage protein levels. Crystallins are stable proteins required at high concentrations in the lens. There are two classes of vertebrate crystallins: the ubiquitous highly conserved α-, β-, and γ-crystallins, and the species-specific δ-, τ-, ε-, and η-crystallins. All of the species-specific crystallins are also metabolic enzymes (for review, see Refs. 33Piatigorsky J. Wistow G.J. Cell. 1989; 57: 197-199Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar and 34Piatigorsky J. Horwitz J. Kuwabara T. Cutress C.E. J. Comp. Physiol. A. 1989; 164: 577-587Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The term gene-sharing has been used to describe the enzyme/crystallin genes that encode a protein with two different functions. The sharing of the TEP1 protein between vaults and telomerase, two seemingly unrelated RNP complexes, suggests that TEP1 may be involved in some aspect of RNP regulation. It is not known what determines whether TEP1 associates with vaults or telomerase or whether there is a dynamic equilibrium between the association of TEP1 with vaults or telomerase. It is even possible that TEP1 is a part of other RNPs. TEP1 interaction with vaults might be via a TEP1-RNA, TEP1-protein, or through a combination requiring both TEP1-RNA and TEP1-protein interactions. It is also possible that vaults themselves function as potential chaperones, possibly delivering TEP1 to the nucleus or aiding in the assembly of TEP1 with other telomerase components in the cytoplasm and then assisting in their delivery to the nucleus. The precise role of TEP1 in the de novo assembly of either of these RNPs will be the subject of further studies.

https://openalex.org/W1986949643,"By using the yeast two-hybrid system we identified a novel protein from the human brain interacting with the C terminus of somatostatin receptor subtype 2. This protein termed somatostatin receptor interacting protein is characterized by a novel domain structure, consisting of six N-terminal ankyrin repeats followed by SH3 and PDZ domains, several proline-rich regions, and a C-terminal sterile α motif. It consists of 2185 amino acid residues encoded by a 9-kilobase pair mRNA; several splice variants have been detected in human and rat cDNA libraries. Sequence comparison suggests that the novel multidomain protein, together with cortactin-binding protein, forms a family of cytoskeletal anchoring proteins. Fractionation of rat brain membranes indicated that somatostatin receptor interacting protein is enriched in the postsynaptic density fraction. The interaction of somatostatin receptor subtype 2 with its interacting protein was verified by overlay assays and coimmunoprecipitation experiments from transfected human embryonic kidney cells. Somatostatin receptor subtype 2 and the interacting protein display a striking overlap of their expression patterns in the rat brain. Interestingly, in the hippocampus the mRNA for somatostatin receptor interacting protein was not confined to the cell bodies but was also observed in the molecular layer, suggesting a dendritic localization of this mRNA.

PSD-95/discs large/ZO-1 cortactin-binding protein 1 glutathioneS-transferase human embryonic kidney postsynaptic density sterile α motif synapse-associated protein 102 Src homology 3 somatostatin receptor somatostatin receptor interacting protein kilobase pairs Targeting of neurotransmitter receptors to postsynaptic or presynaptic sites is an area that has been widely studied in recent years; a large body of evidence has accumulated showing that many receptors are anchored at their specifc site of action by specialized anchoring proteins, which may link receptors to components of the synaptic structure or the cytoskeleton (1Kornau H.C. Schenker L.T. Kennedy M.B. Seeburg P.H. Science. 1995; 269: 1737-1740Crossref PubMed Scopus (1626) Google Scholar, 2Kuhse J. Betz H. Kirsch J. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1995; 5: 318-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). This is true for inhibitory as well as excitatory receptors of the family of ligand-gated ion channels. For the second large family of neurotransmitter receptors, the seven transmembrane domain G-protein-coupled receptors, only very recently have some proteins been identified that may be involved in anchoring or linkage to the cytoskeleton. These include the homer proteins, which are tightly associated with metabotropic glutamate receptors via a PDZ1 domain in homer and the C terminus of the mGluRs (3Brakeman P.R. Lanahan A.A. O'Brien R. Roche K. Barnes C.A. Huganir R.L. Worley P.F. Nature. 1997; 386: 284-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (929) Google Scholar). However, for the large majority of G-protein-coupled receptors, no intracellular associated proteins have been identified so far beyond those proteins which are necessary for signal transduction and functional regulation of the receptors,i.e. the G-proteins and proteins of the arrestin family (4Lefkowitz R.J. Inglese J. Koch W.J. Pitcher J. Attramadal H. Caron M. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1992; 57: 127-133Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We have begun to address this issue for members of the somatostatin receptor family (SSTRs). SSTRs are widely expressed in neuronal tissue and modulate synaptic responses by interacting with inhibitory G-proteins in presynaptic as well as postsynaptic compartments of neurons (e.g. Refs. 5Boehm S. Betz H. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 4066-4075Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6Dournaud P. Gu Y.Z. Schonbrunn A. Mazella J. Tannenbaum G.S. Beaudet A. J.

Schreff M. Schmidt H. Handel M. Przewlocki R. Höllt V. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1998; 10: 3700-3708Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Recently we have used the yeast two-hybrid system to screen for proteins intracellularly associated with SSTR2, one of the major SSTR subtypes in the mammalian brain. Here we show that the C terminus of SSTR2, which contains the consensus sequence for recognition of PDZ domains, interacts with a novel protein termed SSTR interacting protein or SSTRIP. The latter defines a novel family of multidomain cytoskeletal anchoring proteins that are highly enriched in the postsynaptic density fraction derived from rat brain. A yeast two-hybrid screen using the rat SSTR2 C terminus as a bait in the Gal4-DNA binding domain vector pAS2 was described previously (9Zitzer H. Richter D. Kreienkamp H.-J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18153-18156Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The initial partial clone of 900 base pairs (clone 16; Ref. 9Zitzer H. Richter D. Kreienkamp H.-J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18153-18156Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) coding for the PDZ domain of SSTRIP was used as a probe to screen human fetal brain, adult thalamus, and hippocampus cDNA libraries (CLONTECH) in order to obtain the full-length sequence of SSTRIP. By using oligonucleotide primers based on the human sequence, a partial sequence was also amplified from rat hypothalamic cDNA and used for screening of a rat brain cDNA library (kindly provided by Dr. Rainer Reinscheid). A cDNA fragment encoding the PDZ domain of human SSTRIP was cloned into the GST fusion protein vector pGEX2T (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and used for the generation of fusion protein. Overlay assays with a biotinylated fusion protein containing the C terminus of SSTR2 were performed as described (9Zitzer H. Richter D. Kreienkamp H.-J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18153-18156Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The construction of an SSTR2-cDNA carrying an N-terminal T7 epitope tag in the expression vector pcDNA3 (Invitrogen, Leek, The Netherlands) has been described before (10Roth A. Kreienkamp H.-J. Meyerhof W. Richter D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23769-23774Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 11Schwartkop C.-P. Kreienkamp H.-J. Richter D. J. Neurochem. 1999; 72: 1275-1282Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Ntag-SSTR2 and SSTRIP were coexpressed in human embryonic kidney (HEK) cells by transient transfection using the calcium phosphate method as described (12Kreienkamp H.-J. Maeda R. Sine S.M. Taylor P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8108-8114Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For immunoprecipitations, cells were lyzed in 1 ml of RIPA buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 150 mmNaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4) on ice for 20 min and centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 20 min. The epitope-tagged receptor was precipitated from the supernatant fraction using the monoclonal T7-antibody (3 μg) and protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech; 100 μl of a 50% suspension in RIPA buffer) as described (11Schwartkop C.-P. Kreienkamp H.-J. Richter D. J. Neurochem. 1999; 72: 1275-1282Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Precipitates were washed five times with RIPA buffer and denatured by boiling in Laemmli sample buffer. After separation by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, proteins were blotted onto nitrocellulose membranes. SSTRIP was then detected by immunoblotting using the anti-PDZ domain antibody as a primary antibody and goat anti-rabbit coupled to alkaline phosphatase as secondary antibody. Whole brains of adult rats were frozen on dry ice, and 20-μm sections were prepared on a cryostat (Leitz, Wetzlar, Germany). Antisense RNA probes labeled with α-35S-UTP (NEN Life Science Products) were generated using the rat SSTR2 cDNA (13Kluxen F. Bruns C. Lübbert H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 4618-4622Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar) and a rat SSTRIP-clone matching bases 1544–2619 of the human SSTRIP sequence. In situhybridization experiments were performed as described (14Bettler B. Boulter J. Hermans-Borgmeyer I. O'Shea-Greenfield A. Deneris E.S. Moll C. Borgmeyer U. Hollmann M. Heinemann S. Neuron. 1990; 5: 583-595Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar). Sections were exposed to BioMax MR film for 3 days. For higher resolution studies, the same slides were dipped into Kodak NTB-2 nuclear emulsion, developed in Dektol developer (Eastman Kodak Co.) after 2–3 weeks of exposure, and subsequently stained with Giemsa (Sigma). Rat brain membranes were fractionated according to the method described by Carlin et al. (15Carlin R.K. Grab D.J. Cohen R.S. Siekevitz P. J. Cell Biol. 1980; 86: 831-845Crossref PubMed Scopus (605) Google Scholar). Briefly, a postnuclear membrane fraction (crude membranes) was applied to a sucrose multistep gradient, and the synaptosomal fraction was recovered at the interface between 1.0 and 1.2 m sucrose after centrifugation at 82,500 ×g for 2 h. After extraction with 1% Triton X-100, the PSD-one Triton fraction was obtained in a second ultracentrifugation step at 200,000 × g at the interface between 1.5 and 2.0 m sucrose and used for Western blotting experiments. We used the C terminus of the rat SSTR2 as a bait in a yeast two-hybrid screen for potentially interacting proteins (9Zitzer H. Richter D. Kreienkamp H.-J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18153-18156Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar); one novel clone of 900 base pairs, termed SSTRIP for somatostatin receptor interacting protein, was obtained from a human cDNA library which interacted specifically with SSTR2 when compared with the empty bait vector or nonrelated control proteins. This clone encodes a protein fragment that contains a PDZ domain which is highly similar to that of cortactin-binding protein 1 (CortBP1; see Refs. 9Zitzer H. Richter D. Kreienkamp H.-J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18153-18156Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar and 16Du Y. Weed S.A. Xiong W.C. Marshall T.D. Parsons J.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5838-5851Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). Screening of rat and human brain cDNA libraries yielded several splice variants of the full-length SSTRIP as depicted in Fig.1. The longest cDNA derived from human brain contains an open reading frame of 6546 base pairs, coding for a protein of 240 kDa. In this protein, the PDZ domain is preceded by the SH3 domain and a domain containing six ankyrin repeats. The PDZ domain is followed by seven proline-rich domains that may function as SH3-binding domains (17Sudol M. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 1469-1474Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). At the C terminus a sterile α motif (SAM domain) is observed which has been implicated as a dimerization motif for transcription factors as well as receptor tyrosine kinases (18Thanos C.D. Goodwill K.E. Bowie J.U. Science. 1999; 283: 833-836Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar,19Stapleton D. Balan I. Pawson T. Sicheri F. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 44-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). A splice variant of SSTRIP was observed in which the N-terminal region with the six ankyrin repeats as well as the SH3 domain is replaced by the alternative N terminus labeled as exon a in Fig. 1. Accordingly, a major splice site appears to be located between the SH3 domain and the PDZ domain, as an additional partial clone was observed which contains the SH3 and the PDZ domains but lacks an insert of 9 amino acids (insert b in Fig. 1) at this position. Alternative splicing C-terminal of the PDZ domain leads to transcripts that contain an additional insert of 8 amino acids (exon cin Fig. 1) between the PDZ and the first proline-rich domain. However, this variant was so far detected only in rat tissues. In order to confirm the interaction observed in the yeast system in terms of true protein-protein interactions, we performed an overlay assay with a GST fusion protein of the PDZ domain of SSTRIP. Fusion proteins were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and blotted onto nitrocellulose membranes; a biotinylated fusion protein of the SSTR2 C terminus was used as a probe, according to Ref. 9Zitzer H. Richter D. Kreienkamp H.-J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18153-18156Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar. In these experiments, the PDZ domain of SSTRIP exhibited a strong interaction with SSTR2, whereas the GST control protein did not react (Fig.2 A). In vivoattempts to coimmunoprecipitate SSTR2 and SSTRIP from a plasma membrane fraction of rat brains were not successful due to the fact that SSTRIP could only be solubilized in the presence of RIPA supplemented with 2% SDS. These conditions did not permit the detection of specific interactions between SSTR2 and SSTRIP although immunoreactivity of the individual proteins was still present in the solubilized membrane fraction (data not shown). To circumvent this technical problemin vitro, coexpression experiments were performed in HEK cells. An expression vector containing the N-terminal part of SSTRIP (amino acids 1–1288), including the ankyrin, SH3, PDZ, and some of the proline-rich regions, was cotransfected with the rat SSTR2 carrying a N-terminal T7 epitope tag (NT7-SSTR2). When SSTR2 was precipitated from cellular lysates using the T7 antibody, SSTRIP could be efficiently detected in the precipitate by Western blotting. SSTRIP could not be detected in the precipitate when SSTR2 was omitted from the transfection mixture, indicating that SSTR2 specifically interacts with SSTRIP in these cells (Fig. 2 B). It should be noted that SSTRIP coexpressed with the inward rectifier potassium channel protein Kir 2.1 known to carry the consensus sequence for the PDZ domain and to bind to PSD95 (20Cohen N.A. Brenman J.E. Snyder S.H. Bredt D.S. Neuron. 1996; 17: 759-767Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar) in HEK cells did not show coimmunoprecipitation from cell lysates (data not shown) excluding the possibility that SSTRIP interacts with any protein carrying the PDZ consensus sequence at its C terminus. The specificity of the interaction between the SSTR2 C terminus and the PDZ domain of SSTRIP was further analyzed in the yeast two-hybrid system. Bait plasmids encoding the C termini of SSTR1–4 as well as a C-terminally mutated SSTR2 (the last amino acid residue isoleucine is replaced by seven amino acids derived from the bait vector sequence) were coexpressed with the initial target vector obtained from the human brain cDNA library. Activation of the His-3 reporter gene that triggers growth on His-deficient media was observed only in the presence of the wild-type SSTR2 and, to a lesser degree, in the presence of the SSTR4 C terminus (TableI). No growth was seen when the SSTR2 C terminus was modified. These data were confirmed by a β-galactosidase assay on His-positive colonies, indicating that the interaction between SSTR2 and the PDZ domain requires an intact C terminus (Table I). A possible interaction of SSTR4 with the SSTRIP-PDZ domain that was weakly detected here could not be confirmed in an overlay experiment (data not shown).Table ISSTRIP specifically interacts with the SSTR2 C terminusRat SSTR constructNucleotide residuesC-terminal sequenceGrowth on His-deficient mediaβ-Gal assaySSTR11125–1320 (21Meyerhof W.

ND, not determined. The respective references are given in parentheses. As assessed by Northern blot analysis of RNA from various human organs, the SSTRIP gene is expressed in the human brain, particularly in the amygdala, hippocampus, substantia nigra, and thalamus; there two transcripts of 9 and 7.5 kb are detected (Fig.3), the latter probably corresponding to one of the splice variants of SSTRIP shown in Fig. 1. Expression in organs other than brain such as heart, skeletal muscle, kidney, or liver is restricted to the shorter transcript; this may indicate that shorter splice variants of SSTRIP are ubiquitously expressed in tissues other than brain. In order to compare the expression pattern of SSTR2 and SSTRIP, we performed in situ hybridization experiments of rat brain sections. As shown in Fig. 4, in general a striking overlap in the expression pattern of both SSTR2 and SSTRIP was observed, including all layers of the cortex and the hippocampus. Both proteins are also prominently expressed in the medial habenula. A major difference between SSTR2 and SSTRIP was seen in the hippocampus; here both mRNAs are seen in the CA1 and CA2 regions; however, the SSTRIP mRNA was detected not only in cell bodies but also in the molecular layer, suggesting that SSTRIP might add to the growing number of mRNAs which are transported into neuronal dendrites (Fig. 4). A fusion protein containing the PDZ domain was used to raise rabbit polyclonal antibodies; due to the sequence similarity between CortBP1 and the SSTRIP protein in this domain, these antibodies recognize both proteins from rat and human tissues with similar efficiency. This antiserum was used in Western blotting experiments on rat brain membrane fractions. Several specific bands were observed at molecular masses ranging from 180 to 260 kDa (Fig. 5). CortBP1 from rat brain migrates at an apparent molecular mass of 180 kDa (16Du Y. Weed S.A. Xiong W.C. Marshall T.D. Parsons J.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5838-5851Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar), suggesting that the multiple bands at higher molecular weights correspond to the various splice variants of SSTRIP. Specific labeling for CortBP as well as for SSTRIP was obtained in a crude membrane fraction as well as in the synaptosomal fraction and in postsynaptic densities (so-called PSD-one Triton fraction). All bands are strongly enriched in the PSD-one Triton fraction when compared with the crude membrane fraction and the synaptosomal fraction. This enrichment is similar to that observed in a parallel experiment with an antibody specific for synapse-associated protein 102 (SAP102), which has been characterized as a major constituent of postsynaptic densities (24Müller B.M. Kistner U. Kindler S. Chung W.J. Kuhlendahl S. Fenster S.D. Lau L.F. Veh R.W. Huganir R.L. Gundelfinger E.D. Garner C.C. Neuron. 1996; 17: 255-265Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar). To verify the observation that SSTRIP is enriched in the post-synaptic density fraction, we used a second antibody directed against the ankyrin repeat domain of SSTRIP. In this experiment only a single significant band at 240 kDa was observed which is also strongly enriched in the PSD fraction (Fig. 5). Thus our data show that the ankyrin/SH3 domain of SSTRIP is contained in one of the several variants of the SSTRIP/CortBP1 family, all of which are enriched in the postsynaptic density fraction. Here we report the cloning of human SSTRIP, a protein that interacts specifically with the C terminus of the SSTR2 via a PDZ domain-type interaction. During the cloning work of SSTRIP, two sequences from rat brain termed synamon, Shank1 and Spank1, have been deposited in the GenBankTM data base which exhibit strong homology to the human SSTRIP protein and are in fact identical to our partial clone from rat. Rat Shank1 and Spank1 exhibit a domain structure identical to human SSTRIP, whereas the reported rat synamon sequence lacks the SAM domain. In addition, a protein termed ProSAP1 (proline-rich synapse associated protein 1) was reported (25Böckers T.M. Kreutz M.R. Winter C. Zuschratter W. Wex H. Langnäse K. Sanmarti-Vila L. Bockmann J. Garner C.C. Gundelfinger E.D. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 6506-6518Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) which is largely identical to CortBP1 but which exhibits several alternative splicing sites in positions homologous to those reported here for SSTRIP. The homology between SSTRIP and CortBP1/ProSAP1 is limited to the PDZ and SAM domains, where the sequence identity between the two proteins reaches 86 (PDZ) and 73% (SAM). In contrast, the region between the PDZ and the SAM domain displays a sequence identity of 25% only. A third cDNA may be present, as both SSTRIP and CortBP1/ProSAP1 align to a genomic fragment from the human chromosome 22, with very high sequence similarity again in the PDZ and SAM domains. As the PDZ domains of these three proteins are structurally very similar, it appears likely that the many variants of these three proteins may be responsible for anchoring SSTR2 in many different localizations in neurons. This is in agreement with immunohistochemical data, which have shown that the SSTR2 protein is present in presynaptic as well as in somatodendritic, postsynaptic compartments of neuronal cells (6Dournaud P.

It remains to be shown, however, if the ankyrin repeat domain and the SH3 domain are also present in splice variants of CortB1 and the unknown protein derived from human chromosome 22. The strong enrichment of proteins of this family in the postsynaptic density fraction from rat brain indicates that we have detected an important structural component of this postsynaptic structure. In this respect the function of SSTRIP and its homologs may go far beyond an anchoring function for somatostatin receptors, as family members have been identified independently by experimental approaches looking for interaction partners for cortactin (16Du Y.

Unlike many ABC transporters that are single functional proteins with two related halves, ALDP, ALDRP, and PMP70 have the structure of ABC half-transporters. The dysfunction of ALDP is responsible for X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy (X-ALD), a neurodegenerative disorder in which saturated very long-chain fatty acids accumulate because of their impaired peroxisomal β-oxidation. No disease has so far been associated with mutations of adrenoleukodystrophy-related or PMP70 genes. It has been proposed that peroxisomal ABC transporters need to dimerize to exert import functions. Using the yeast two-hybrid system, we show that homo- as well as heterodimerization occur between the carboxyl-terminal halves of ALDP, ALDRP, and PMP70. Two X-ALD disease mutations located in the carboxyl-terminal half of ALDP affect both homo- and heterodimerization of ALDP. Co-immunoprecipitation demonstrated the homodimerization of ALDP, the heterodimerization of ALDP with PMP70 or ALDRP, and the heterodimerization of ALDRP with PMP70. These results provide the first evidence of both homo- and heterodimerization of mammalian ABC half-transporters and suggest that the loss of ALDP dimerization plays a role in X-ALD pathogenesis.

Typical mammalian ABC transporters, like the multidrug-resistant P-glycoprotein, are single functional proteins with two related halves comprised of one hydrophobic transmembrane domain and one hydrophilic nucleotide-binding fold (NBF) (6Higgins C.F. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1992; 8: 67-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (3350) Google Scholar). In contrast, the peroxisomal ABC transporters, as well as TAP1/TAP2 (7Spies T. Cerundolo V. Colonna M. Cresswell P.

X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy (X-ALD) is the only genetic disease known to result from a peroxisomal ABC transporter gene defect. This neurodegenerative disorder is characterized by progressive demyelination within the central nervous system, adrenal insufficiency, and accumulation of very long-chain fatty acids because of an impaired peroxisomal β-oxidation (9Moser H.W.

Although it is firmly established that the loss of ALDP function is responsible for the abnormality in VLCFA metabolism, its precise role is unknown. Similarly, no precise function has been assigned to ALDRP, PMP70, or PMP70-related proteins. ALDRP, PMP70, and PMP70-related protein present 66, 38, and 27% amino acid identity with ALDP, respectively, suggesting functional similarity of these four transporters. These proteins display specific but sometimes overlapping patterns of expression in different cell types (13Fouquet F. Zhou J.M. Ralston E. Murray K. Troalen F. Magal E. Robain O. Dubois-Dalcq M.

Cell Biol. 1998; 75: 254-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Because it is likely that half-transporters need to dimerize to exert their function (6Higgins C.F. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1992; 8: 67-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (3350) Google Scholar), this raises the possibility that different types of peroxisomal ABC dimers could allow the import of distinct substrates. Few ABC transporters are known to dimerize. Genetic evidence suggests that the bacterial hemolysin transporter B ABC half-transporter forms homodimers (16Fath M.J. Kolter R. Microbiol. Rev. 1993; 57: 995-1017Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), whereas the Drosophilawhite, brown, and scarlet gene products form heterodimers (17Ewart G.D. Cannell D. Cox G.B. Howells A.J. J. Biol.

Heterodimerization of ABC transporters has also been reported for the transporters of antigenic peptides, TAP1 and TAP2 (18Kelly A. Powis S.H. Kerr L.A. Mockridge I. Elliott T. Bastin J.

This study used the yeast two-hybrid assay to show that the carboxyl-terminal half of ALDP, ALDRP, and PMP70 can engage in homo- and heterodimerization. These two processes were confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation methods. We examined the effect of four different ALD patient mutations upon these interactions and attempted to map the carboxyl-terminal subdomains of ALDP allowing dimerization of the protein. Monoclonal antibody 1D6 against human ALDP (hALDP) and polyclonal antibodies 1664 and 7373 raised against mouse ALDP (mALDP) and mouse ALDRP (mALDRP), respectively, have been described previously (13Fouquet F.

Polyclonal antibody 1693 against hALDP was raised against the last 19 amino acids of this protein. Anti-mouse PMP70 (mPMP70) antibody was a gift from Dr. David Valle (Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD). All these antibodies show specific protein affinities except the anti-mALDP 1664 antibody, which recognizes both human and mouse ALDP. The two-hybrid assays were performed in the yeast strains HF7c (MATa, ura3–52, his3–200, ade2–101, lys2–801, trp1–901, leu2–3, 112, canr, gal4–542, gal80–538, URA::Gal4 binding sites-CYC1-lacZ, LYS2::GAL1-HIS3) and L40 (MATa, trp1, leu2, his3, LYS2::lexA-HIS3, URA3::lexA-lacZ).

PCR products were cloned into pGBT9, pLEX9 (Invitrogen), and pGADGE yeast expression vectors. The cDNA fragments encoding the carboxyl-terminal subdomains of hALDP (N, residues 361–506; N+NBF, residues 361–630; C, residues 631–745; and NBF+C, residues 507–745) were amplified by PCR and cloned into pLEX9. The integrity of cloned PCR products was confirmed by DNA sequencing. ALD point mutations (R389H, R401Q, P484R, and R591Q) were individually introduced into pGBT- and pLEX-hALDPc by site-directed mutagenesis using “overlap extension PCR” with Pfu polymerase (Stratagene) and appropriate primers (25Chowers M.Y. Spina C.A. Kwoh T.J. Fitch N.J.S. Richman D.D. Guatelli J.C. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 2906-2914Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Mutated inserts were completely sequenced. HF7c or L40 yeast reporter strains containing Gal4- or LexA- inducible genes, HIS3 andLacZ, were cotransformed with pGBT9/pLEX9 and pGADGE vectors and plated on selective medium lacking tryptophan and leucine. Double transformants were patched on the same medium and replica-plated on selective medium lacking tryptophan, leucine, and histidine for histidine auxotrophy analysis and on Whatman 40 filter for β-galactosidase assay. Yeast double transformants expressing wild type or mutated ALDPc hybrids were lysed in SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis sample buffer and analyzed by Western blotting with anti-hALDP antibody 1693. 20 × 106 M48-hALD, MFG-mALDR-producer Psi-CRIP cells, or normal 3T3 cells were lysed in 1 ml of binding buffer (25 mmHepes, pH 7.4, 150 mm KCl, 5 mm EDTA, and 0.1% Triton X-100) containing a protease inhibitors mixture (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Lysates were incubated overnight at 4 °C with either anti-hALDP (1D6, diluted 1:150), anti-mALDP (1664, diluted 1:250), or anti-mPMP70 (diluted 1:500) antibodies. Protein A-Sepharose beads (PAS) were then added for 1 h at 4 °C. After three washes with binding buffer, PAS-bound fractions were resuspended in SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis sample buffer and analyzed by Western blotting. Yeast transformant or fibroblast lysates were electrophoresed on a 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and then transferred onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) in a semi-dry blotter. Proteins were labeled with appropriate antibodies as commonly described. Antigen-antibody complexes were detected using ECL system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). ALDP, ALDRP, and PMP70 are peroxisomal membrane proteins with a carboxyl-terminal hydrophilic domain oriented toward the cytoplasm (1Mosser J. Douar A.-M. Sarde C.-O. Kioschis P. Feil R. Moser H.

To examine the possible interactions among ALDP, ALDRP, and PMP70, we generated constructs in which hALDPc, mALDRPc, and hPMP70c were fused to the Gal4 or LexA binding domain (BD) or the Gal4 activation domain (AD). Each hybrid protein was analyzed for protein-protein interactions with the others in the yeast strains containing Gal4- (HF7c strain) or LexA- (L40 strain) inducible reporter genes, HIS3 andLacZ. Protein-protein interaction was monitored by the ability of yeast patches to grow in the absence of histidine and by the β-galactosidase activity. The results obtained in the L40 yeast strain are shown in Fig. 1. Similar results were obtained in the HF7 yeast strain (data not shown). β-galactosidase activity and growth of yeast patches in the absence of histidine were observed when hALDPc or mALDRPc was present as both BD and AD hybrids (Fig. 1 A, rows 1 and3). Interaction was also detected between hALDPc fused to LexA-BD and mALDRPc fused to Gal4-AD (Fig. 1 A, row 2). Identical results were obtained using symmetrical hybrid proteins (not shown). The specificity of the interactions was demonstrated by the absence of β-galactosidase activity or growth in medium without histidine when hALDc or mALDRPc was assayed with the irrelevant Raf serine/threonine kinase (Fig. 1 A, rows 4 and 5). Interaction between Raf and p21 ras (27Vojtek A.B. Hollenberg S.M. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 255: 331-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar) was used as a positive control (Fig. 1A, row 6). Interactions were also observed between hPMP70c fused to LexA-BD and hPMP70c and between hALDPc or mALDRPc fused to Gal4-AD (Fig.1 B, rows 1, 3, and 5). No interaction could be observed between hPMP70c and the Raf protein or between Ras and hALDPc or mALDRPc (Fig. 1 B, row 2, 4, and 6). These data demonstrate that the carboxyl-terminal halves of human ALDP, mouse ALDRP, and human PMP70 can interact with themselves and each other in the yeast two-hybrid system. We examined the effects of four naturally occurring X-ALD mutations upon interaction of hALDPc with itself, mALDRPc, or hPMP70c. These mutations (R389H, R401Q, P484R, and R591Q) were generated as described above and tested in two-hybrid assays. The P484R mutation leads to a decreased amount of ALDP in patient fibroblasts, 3J. Berger, personal communication. whereas the three other mutations have no effect on ALDP stability in vivo (28Kok F. Neumann S. Sarde C.-O. Siqun Z. Wu K.-H. Wei H.-M. Bergin J. Watkins P. Gould S.

Genet. 1996; 97: 194-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Our results show that the mutations R389H and R401Q had no effect on the interactions of hALDPc with itself (Fig.2 A, rows 1,3, and 5), mALDRPc (Fig. 2 B,rows 1, 3, and 5), or hPMP70c (Fig.2 C, rows 1, 3, and 5). In contrast, the P484R and R591Q mutations decreased significantly the interaction of hALDPc with itself (Fig. 2 A, rows 7 and9) and abolished its interactions with mALDRPc (Fig.2 B, rows 7 and 9) and hPMP70c (Fig.2 C, rows 7 and 9). No interaction of wild type or the four mutated ALD hybrid proteins was observed with the irrelevant protein SNF4 (Fig. 2 A, B, andC, rows 2, 4, 6,8, and 10). Western blotting with anti-hALDP antibody 1693 revealed that the four mutated hALDPc hybrids were expressed in yeast at the same level as wild type hALDPc hybrid (Fig.2 D), ruling out that the lack of growth in the absence of histidine was because of the unstability of mutated ALD hybrid proteins. These results demonstrate that the residues Pro-484 and Arg-591 are important for the interaction of the carboxyl-terminal domain of human ALDP with itself, mALDRP, and hPMP70 and suggest that the loss of ALDP function in patients harboring either of these two mutations may result from an ALDP dimerization defect. To determine which region of hALDPc is necessary and sufficient for its interactions with itself, mALDRPc, and PMP70c, we constructed four deletants of hALDPc that were analyzed in the yeast two-hybrid system for their ability to interact with hALDPc, mALDRPc, or hPMP70c (Fig. 3). Based on histidine auxotrophy and β-galactosidase activity assays, none of these deletants interacted with their partners as strong as the full-length hALDPc. When tested against hPMP70c, only background level was detected for all these deletants. The C (residues 631–745) deletant retained nearly normal strength of domain-domain interactions with hALDPc and mALDRPc, whereas the N (residues 361–506) and NBF+C (residues 361–630) deletants exhibited marked decrease of interaction. No interaction was observed with the N+NBF deletant (Fig. 3). Western blotting using anti-hALDP antibodies (1693 and 1D6) showed that the four deletants of hALDPc were expressed at similar level as hALDPc in yeast transformants (not shown). These results indicate that none of the subdomains that we have delineated are necessary and sufficient for domain-domain interactions of hALDPc with itself, mALDRPc, and PMP70c. We took advantage of the high similarity between mouse and human ALDP, ALDRP, and PMP70 (91.9%, 93.7%, and 94.5% of identity, respectively) to study interactions of these proteins in normal 3T3 cells, which express only mouse ALDP and PMP70 but not mouse ALDRP, and in 3T3 cells genetically modified by retroviral vectors to express in addition either hALDP or mALDRP. Immunoprecipitations were performed as described under “Experimental Procedures” followed by Western blot analysis of PAS-bound fractions with appropriate antibodies. Following immunoprecipitation with anti-hALDP antibody, hALDP and mPMP70 bands were detected in the PAS-bound fraction of 3T3 cells expressing hALDP demonstrating the heterodimerization between hALDP and mPMP70 (Fig.4 A, lane 1,upper and lower panels). The same experiment was performed in 3T3 cells expressing mALDRP but not hALDP. As expected, neither the hALDP nor the mPMP70 band could be detected (Fig.4 A, lane 2, upper and lower panels). Heterodimerization of mALDP with mALDRP was demonstrated by the co-immunoprecipitation of these two proteins using anti-mALDP antibody in 3T3 cells expressing mALDRP (Fig. 4 B, lane 2,top and middle panels). A control experiment was performed in 3T3 cells expressing hALDP but not mALDRP. Because the antibody against mALDP cross-reacts with hALDP, immunoprecipitation with this antibody in 3T3 cells expressing hALDP resulted in the presence of both mouse and human ALDP bands in the PAS-bound fraction as revealed by immunoblotting with anti-mALDP (Fig. 4 B,lane 1, top panel) and specific anti-hALDP antibody (Fig. 4 B, lane 1, bottom panel). However, no band was detected in the PAS-bound fraction with the antibody against mALDRP (Fig. 4 B, lane 1, middle panel), indicating that the signal detected in cells expressing mALDRP is specific to mouse ALDRP (Fig.4 B, lane 2, middle panel). Immunoprecipitation with anti-hALDP antibody in 3T3 cells expressing hALDP and in normal 3T3 cells demonstrated the dimerization of hALDP with mALDP. Using anti-hALDP antibody, Western blotting of PAS-bound fractions (Fig. 4 C, lanes 1 and 2) and cellular lysates (Fig. 4 C, lanes 3 and4) showed a specific hALDP band in cells expressing hALDP (Fig. 4 C, lanes 1 and 3, upper panel). No hALDP band was detected in normal 3T3 cells (Fig.4 C, lanes 2 and 4, upper panel). Reprobing with anti-mALDP antibody revealed that in a PAS-bound fraction and cellular lysate of cells expressing hALDP a hALDP band accounted for the cross-reaction of anti-mALDP antibodies with hALDP and a fainter and higher band that corresponded to mALDP (Fig. 4 C, lanes 1 and 3, lower panel). No mALDP band was detected in a PAS-bound fraction of normal 3T3 cells (Fig. 4 C, lane 2, lower panel), although it could be revealed in cellular lysate prior to immunoprecipitation (Fig. 4 C, lane 4, lower panel). Finally, immunoprecipitation with antibodies against mPMP70 in 3T3 cells expressing hALDP or mALDRP cells demonstrated heterodimerization of mPMP70 with hALDP (Fig. 4 D, lane 1,middle panel) and mALDRP (Fig. 4 D, lane 2, bottom panel). Altogether, our results demonstrate that human ALDP dimerizes with mouse PMP70, mouse ALDP with human ALDP and mouse ALDRP, and mouse PMP70 with mouse ALDRP. The high degree of homology among ALDP, ALDRP, and PMP70 together with their expression pattern suggest that these ABC half-transporters may therefore assume a specific function in a particular cell type or have similar/redundant functions in the same cell type. Although the exact function of ALDP is unknown, it is involved in the metabolism of VLCFA in peroxisomes. The oxidation of VLCFA is initiated by a VLCFA acyl-CoA synthetase (VLACS), which activates VLCFA into acyl-CoA derivatives. The oxidation of VLCFA is reduced by 60–80% in ALD fibroblasts because of a deficiency in VLACS activity (11Wanders R.J.A. Van Roermund C.W.T. van Wijland M.J.A. Schutgens R.B.H. Van den Bosch H.

Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 7647-7651Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). Studies of the two yeast peroxisomal ABC transporters, Pxa1p and Pxa2p, provided clues about the putative function of ALDP (19Shani N. Watkins P.A. Valle D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 6012-6016Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 20Hettema E.H. Van Roermund C.W.T. Distel B. Van den Berg M. Vilela C. Rodrigues-Pousada C. Wanders R.J.A. Tabak H.F.

Biochem. 1997; 249: 657-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). In yeast, long-chain fatty acids (LCFA) are activated into CoA derivatives within the cytosol by a LCFA-CoA synthetase and then transported across the peroxisomal membrane by Pxa1p/Pxa2p heterodimers. Similarly, ALDP could import VLCFA-CoA into peroxisomes following dimerization with itself or a partner. Whether the active site of the mammalian VLACS is located on the cytoplasmic or luminal side of peroxisomes remains unclear (33Lageweg W. Tager J.M. Wanders R.J.A. Biochem. J. 1991; 276: 53-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 34Lazo O. Contreras M. Singh I. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 3981-3986Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). If it is located within peroxisomes, this would rather support that ALDP transports VLCFA or a substrate necessary to VLACS activation. It is unlikely that ALDP transports the VLACS enzyme across the peroxisomal membrane because VLACS is normally expressed in the liver from ALDP-deficient mice and normally localized in peroxisomes (35Yamada T. Taniwaki T. Shinnoh N. Uchiyama A. Shimozawa N. Ohyagi Y. Asahara H. Kira J. Neurology. 1999; 52: 614-616Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Because overexpression of ALDRP corrects the accumulation of VLCFA in ALD fibroblasts (23Flavigny E. Sanhaj A. Aubourg P. Cartier N. FEBS Lett. 1999; 448: 261-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 36Kemp S. Wei H.M. Lu J.F. Braiterman L.T. McGuinness M.C. Moser A.B. Watkins P.A. Smith K.D. Nat.

Genet. 1999; 8: 907-913Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar), it is possible that ALDRP has a substrate specificity overlapping with ALDP. Overexpression of PMP70 in Chinese hamster ovary cells increases by 2–3-fold the rate of palmitic acid β-oxidation into peroxisomes, suggesting that PMP70 is involved in the metabolic transport of LCFA across peroxisomal membrane (38Imanaka T. Aihara K. Takano T. Yamashita A. Sato R. Suzuki Y. Yokota S. Osumi T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11968-11976Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). ALDRP and PMP70 could also import fatty acids with other chain lengths as well. Using the yeast two-hybrid system, we observed that the carboxyl-terminal half of ALDP, ALDRP, and PMP70 can form homo- or heterodimers, a novel function of the nucleotide binding domain of ABC transporters. ALDP homo- and heterodimerization are altered by two disease-associated mutations, suggesting that ALDP homo- and/or heterodimerization are necessary for its function. Interestingly, the P484R mutation results in an unstable protein in vivo. Analysis of ALD mutations showed that 62.5–66% of ALD gene missense mutations lead to an unstable protein (10Dubois-Dalcq M. Feigenbaum V. Aubourg P. Trends Neurosci. 1999; 22: 4-12Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 39Smith D.K. Kemp S. Braiterman L.T. Lu J.F. Wei H.M. Stetten G. Bergin J.S. Revsner J. Watkins P.A. Neurochem. Res. 1999; 24: 511-525Google Scholar). Our results demonstrate that ALDP unstability in vivo may directly result from dimerization deficiency. In contrast, the R591Q disease mutation, which alters the dimerization of ALDP in the yeast two-hybrid assays, does not lead to ALDP unstability in vivo. The stability of ALDP is therefore not entirely dependent on the dimerization of the carboxyl-terminal domains. This is supported by the observation that several ALDP missense mutations (in particular R518W and P560L) can lead to either a normal, decreased level or absence of ALDP in ALD fibroblasts. 4L. X. Liu, K. Janvier, V. Berteaux-Lecellier, N. Cartier, R. Benarous, and P. Aubourg, unpublished observation. The specific carboxyl-terminal subdomain region of ALDP responsible for dimerization could not be defined. Western blot analysis indicated, however, that all subdomains were correctly expressed. This suggests that in the absence of the neighboring protein sequence, the subdomain involved in dimerizations was probably incorrectly folded and failed to interact with its partners. Alternatively, the integrality of the carboxyl-terminal domain may be required for the interactions. Taking advantage of the high homology between mouse and human ALDP, ALDRP, and PMP70, we demonstrate that dimerization occurs between human ALDP and mouse PMP70, between mouse ALDP and human ALDP or mouse ALDRP, and between mouse PMP70 and mouse ALDRP using the co-immunoprecipitation method. Although we did not study the homodimerization of PMP70 and ALDRP, our results in the yeast two-hybrid system suggest strongly that these two ABC half-transporters can also form homodimers. A summary of our data is that each peroxisomal ABC half-transporter can dimerize with itself or with a related partner. Regarding Drosophila, the uptake of precursors for the synthesis of red and brown pigments is controlled by various combinations of the ABC half-transporters scarlet, brown, and white,resulting in different substrate specificities (17Ewart G.D. Cannell D. Cox G.B. Howells A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10370-10377Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Our results raise the possibility that different combinations of peroxisomal dimers perform the import of different substrates, including fatty acids of different lengths. If confirmed, it may have important implications for the pathogenesis and phenotypic heterogeneity of ALD. The inability of a mutated ALDP to heterodimerize with other partners might result in the accumulation of metabolites other than VLCFA. This may modulate the functions of cells directly affected by the ALD mutations and eventually influence the clinical manifestations of the disease. PMP70 being involved in the peroxisomal β-oxidation of LCFA (38Imanaka T. Aihara K. Takano T. Yamashita A. Sato R. Suzuki Y. Yokota S. Osumi T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11968-11976Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), different amounts of ALDP and PMP70 homo- and heterodimers could determine the oxidation rate of VLCFA and LCFA in response to substrate availability and/or cell-specific expression of ALDP and PMP70. Imanaka et al. (38Imanaka T. Aihara K. Takano T. Yamashita A. Sato R. Suzuki Y. Yokota S. Osumi T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11968-11976Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) showed that overexpression of PMP70 in 3T3 cells reduced the oxidation rate of VLCFA by 30–40%. One explanation could be that the overexpression of PMP70 competes with ALDP for the targeting to the peroxisomal membrane. It is also possible that overexpression of PMP70 leads to the increased formation of ALDP-PMP70 heterodimers and a decrease of ALDP homodimers. However, the overexpression of wild type or functionally defective PMP70 have similar effects on VLCFA β-oxidation (38Imanaka T. Aihara K. Takano T. Yamashita A. Sato R. Suzuki Y. Yokota S. Osumi T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11968-11976Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Thus ALDP-PMP70 heterodimers may not be directly involved in the β-oxidation of VLCFA or LCFA but rather constitute a reservoir of ALDP and PMP70 molecules that contribute to the maintenance of the appropriate ratio of ALDP and PMP70 homodimers within the peroxisomal membrane. This hypothesis is consistent with the observations that PMP70 levels are reduced in ALD fibroblasts lacking ALDP (40Smith K. Second FEBS Advanced Lecture Course, February 20–27, 1999, Gosau, Austria. Federation of the European Biochemical Societies, Gosau, Austria1999Google Scholar) and that ALDP overexpression in 3T3 cells increases the amount of PMP70.4 Our results may have implications for gene therapy approach aiming at targeting the ALD gene into hematopoietic cells or oligodendrocytes (10Dubois-Dalcq M. Feigenbaum V. Aubourg P. Trends Neurosci. 1999; 22: 4-12Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 41Doerflinger N. Miclea J.-M. Lopez J. Chomienne C. Bougnères P. Aubourg P. Cartier N. Hum. Gene Ther. 1998; 9: 1025-1036Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Because ALDP, ALDRP, and PMP70 form a different combination of dimers, one should ensure that artificial expression of ALDP does not disrupt significantly the balance between the physiological dimers in transduced cells.

To understand the regulation of p53 cellular trafficking, we have previously identified two p53 domains involved in its localization. A basic domain, Lys305–Arg306, is required for p53 nuclear import, and a carboxyl-terminal domain, namely the cytoplasmic sequestration domain (CSD) from residues 326–355, could block the nuclear import of Lys305 or Arg306 mutated p53. To characterize further the function of these two domains, we demonstrate in this report that the previously described major nuclear localization signal works together with Lys305–Arg306 to form a bipartite and functional nuclear localization sequence (NLS) for p53 nuclear import. The CSD could block the binding of p53 to the NLS receptor, importin α, and reduce the efficiency of p53 nuclear import in MCF-7, H1299, and Saos-2 cells. The blocking effect of the CSD is not due to the enhancement of nuclear export or oligomerization of the p53. These results indicate that the CSD can regulate p53 nuclear import by controlling access of the NLS to importin α binding.

Indeed, in certain human cancers (breast cancers, colon cancers, and neuroblastoma), wild-type p53 is localized predominantly in the cytoplasm, suggesting that the inactivation of wild-type p53 in cancer cells could partly result from a defect in the regulation of p53 subcellular localization (8Bosari S.

Protein shuttling between the nucleus and the cytoplasm is fundamentally controlled by both a nuclear localization sequence (NLS)1 and a nuclear export sequence (NES). These topogenic sequences bind to specific receptors that allow selective passage through the nuclear pore complex (reviewed in Refs. 11Görlich D. Mattaj I.W. Science. 1996; 271: 1513-1518Crossref PubMed Scopus (1067) Google Scholar, 12Nigg E.A. Nature. 1997; 386: 779-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (921) Google Scholar, 13Weis K. Trends Biochem.

Classical NLSs are either a monopartite motif that consists of a single, short stretch of several basic amino acids or a bipartite motif that consists of two separated clusters of basic residues (Table I). Both types of signals can be recognized by the nuclear import factor, karyopherin α or importin α, to initiate nuclear entry of the protein. On the other hand, the NES is characterized by a leucine-rich sequence. An NES receptor, exportin 1 or CRM1, has been identified to be responsible for protein nuclear export (14Fornerod M. Ohno M.

Open table in a new tab It has been shown that the p53 protein is subject to both nuclear import and export via a fast, energy-dependent pathway (17Middeler G. Zerf D. Jenovai S. Thülig A. Tschodrich-Rötter M. Kubitscheck U. Peters R. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 1407-1417Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Similar to other nuclear proteins, the p53 protein contains both an NLS and an NES. Three putative NLSs residing in the carboxyl terminus of p53 were first identified based on sequence and mutagenesis analyses (18Shaulsky G. Goldfinger N. Ben-Ze'ev A. Rotter V. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 6565-6577Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). The major one, NLSI (PQPKKKP), was proven to be functionally important for p53 nuclear import and can direct a cytoplasmic reporter protein, pyruvate kinase, completely into the nucleus (19Dang C.V. Lee W.M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 18019-18023Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A recent study has identified a Rev-like NES located in the tetramerization domain that is involved in p53 nuclear export mediated by the CRM1 (20Stommel J.M. Marchenko N.D. Jimenez G.S. Moll U.M. Hope T.J. Wahl G.M. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1660-1672Crossref PubMed Scopus (607) Google Scholar). This intrinsic NES is sufficient to mediate p53 nuclear export, although other studies have reported that Hdm2 can also shuttle p53 from the nucleus to the cytoplasm (21Roth J. Dobbelstein M. Freedman D.A. Shenk T. Levine A.J. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 554-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (533) Google Scholar, 22Tao W. Levine A.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 3077-3080Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). It was proposed that oligomerization can cause p53 nuclear retention via masking of the NES (20Stommel J.M. Marchenko N.D. Jimenez G.S. Moll U.M. Hope T.J. Wahl G.M. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1660-1672Crossref PubMed Scopus (607) Google Scholar). We have identified two cis-acting domains important for p53 subcellular localization as follows: a basic domain (Lys305-Arg306), in addition to the known NLSI, that is required for p53 nuclear import, and a carboxyl-terminal cytoplasmic sequestration domain (CSD, residues 326–355) that interacts with this Lys-Arg domain to regulate p53 nuclear import (23Liang S.H. Hong D. Clarke M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19817-19821Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar,24Liang S.H. Clarke M.F. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 2163-2166Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The CSD contains an oligomerization domain and the NES. In the present report, we demonstrate that NLSI alone is not sufficient to direct p53 nuclear import due to a weak binding to importin α. The Lys-Arg and NLSI together form a bipartite NLS that allows importin α to bind more tightly to p53, therefore mediating the nuclear import of p53. Furthermore, we show that the CSD modulates the binding of importin α to the NLS. In contrast to nuclear export, oligomerization does not inhibit p53 nuclear import. The MCF-7 breast cancer cell line, which expresses wild-type p53, and two p53-null cell lines, H1299 lung adenocarcinoma and Saos-2 osteosarcoma, were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) containing 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum at 37 °C in a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere. To analyze the function of p53 nuclear localization signals (NLS), the DNA fragments corresponding to p53 amino acid residues 316–322, 305–322, and K305N-322 were amplified by PCR and subcloned into the KpnI and NotI sites in the 3′ end of a Myc-tagged chicken muscle pyruvate kinase (PK) cDNA expression plasmid (25Siomi H. Dreyfuss G. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 551-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar). To replace the NLSI (residues 316–322; PQPKKKP) of p53 with the SV40 large T antigen NLS (PKKKRKV), a two-step PCR mutagenesis protocol was performed as described previously (23Liang S.H. Hong D.

Richards S.A. Lounsbury K.M. Macara I.G. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 985-996Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). To analyze the relationship between p53 oligomerization and nuclear import, the FLAG-tagged DNA fragment corresponding to p53 residues 325–369 was amplified by PCR with a 5′ primer containing FLAG sequences, and the PCR product was ligated to the BamHI and EcoRI sites of the pcDNA3 plasmid. All other mutated p53 constructs were made by two-step PCR and inserted into the plasmid pK7-GFP. Cells were grown on glass coverslips in six-well plates and transfected using LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.) as described previously (23Liang S.H. Hong D. Clarke M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19817-19821Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). After transfection, cells were washed with PBS and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min at room temperature. After three washes with PBS, the fixed cell were then permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS for 2 min and incubated in PBS containing 0.5% bovine serum albumin for 20 min. Where indicated, cells were incubated for 1 h with an anti-FLAG M2 monoclonal antibody (Sigma) or an anti-c-Myc monoclonal antibody (9E10, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) followed by 50 min incubation with fluorescein isothiocyanate or lissamine rhodamine B sulfonyl chloride (LRSC)-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories). After a final wash with PBS, coverslips were mounted with antifade solution (100 mm NaHCO3 pH 9.0, 4 mg/mlp-phenylenediamine, 50% glycerol) and examined by fluorescence microscopy. MCF-7 cells were transiently transfected with plasmid p53K305N-GFP. Two days after transfection, cells were treated with 100 nm leptomycin B (LMB) for 4 h.

Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2131-2143Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar), was then determined by indirect immunostaining using a combination of monoclonal antibody to human cyclin B1 (GNS1, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and LRSC-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG. The cellular localizations of exogenous p53K305N-GFP and endogenous cyclin B1 in a sample were visualized and differentiated by fluorescence microscopy. The wild-type or mutated p53 DNA fragments were ligated into theBamHI and EcoRI sites of vector pGEX-2T (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and transformed into the Escherichia colistrain DH5α. The cell culture and batch purification of glutathioneS-transferase (GST) fusion proteins were performed according to manufacturer's instructions. The E. coli strain BLR containing GST fusions of a functional SV40 large T antigen nuclear localization signal (Tag NLS) or an inverse version of Tag NLS (Tag NLSinv) were cultured, and the proteins were purified as described (29Rexach M. Blobel G. Cell. 1995; 83: 683-692Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (665) Google Scholar). The plasmid pRSET-hSRP1α containing a cDNA of human importin α (30Weis K. Mattaj I.W. Lamond A.I. Science. 1995; 268: 1049-1053Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar) was used to produce a [35S]methionine-labeled protein using the Promega TNT T7 Quick Coupled Translation System. Fifteen micrograms of GST-p53 or p53 mutants and 7 μg of GST-Tag NLS or GST-TagNLSinv were incubated with 40 μl of glutathione-agarose beads (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) in 0.5 ml of binding buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 6.8, 150 mm KOAc, 2 mm Mg(OAc)2, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1% Tween 20) for 2 h at 4 °C. The beads were collected and washed three times with binding buffer. After washing, one-twentieth of the beads were removed to analyze the amount of immobilized GST fusion proteins by immunoblotting with the anti-p53 pAb122 hybridoma supernatant (ATCC TIB116) or the anti-GST mouse IgG1 monoclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). The rest of the beads were incubated with 90 μl of in vitro translated importin α reaction mixture for 4 h at 4 °C. The beads were then washed six times with binding buffer, boiled in 30 μl of sample buffer, and the immobilized proteins were resolved on a SDS-10% polyacrylamide gel. The 35S-labeled importin α bound to the GST fusion proteins was detected by fluorography using Amplify Reagent (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The relative intensity of importin α was measured by NIH Image software. Due to the fact that p53 cellular localization is a dynamic equilibrium between rapid nuclear import and ongoing export, it is possible that the cytoplasmic sequestration effect of the Lys305 or Arg306 mutations is a result of enhancement of p53 nuclear export, probably by increasing the interaction with CRM1. To address this possibility, MCF-7 cells transiently transfected with the p53K305N-GFP plasmid were treated with leptomycin B (LMB). The transfected cells were immunostained for cyclin B1 as the control of LMB inhibition of CRM1-mediated nuclear export (28Yang J. Bardes E.S.G. Moore J.D. Brennan J. Powers M.A. Kornbluth S. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2131-2143Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). The results showed that although cyclin B1 shifted from the cytoplasm to the nucleus after LMB treatment, Lys305-mutated p53 (p53K305) still accumulated in the cytoplasm (Fig. 1). This indicates that cytoplasmic sequestration of p53K305 is not a result of an increase in nuclear export but a result of a defect in nuclear import. Previously we showed that a spacer between the Lys305–Arg306 motif and NLSI is necessary for entrance of p53 into the cell nucleus (24Liang S.H. Clarke M.F. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 2163-2166Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Thus, it is possible that the Lys305–Arg306 motif and NLSI work together as a bipartite NLS. To test this possibility, the NLSI alone or the complete sequence from Lys305 to NLSI were fused with a cytoplasmic protein, Myc-tagged pyruvate kinase, to analyze their nuclear targeting efficiency. The NLSs were fused to a Myc-tagged pyruvate kinase (Myc-PK, Ref. 25Siomi H. Dreyfuss G. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 551-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar) at the carboxyl terminus, and all constructs were transfected into MCF-7 cells. The results showed that although the sequence composed of residues 305–322 was sufficient to direct a complete nuclear import of Myc-PK, neither NLSI alone (residues 316–322) nor Lys305-mutated sequences were able to do so (Fig. 2). To determine further the effect of NLSI in its native context within the p53 protein, we replaced NLSI in p53K305 with the SV40 large T antigen NLS (Tag NLS, PKKKRKV), a well defined monopartite NLS. If NLSI functions the same way as that of Tag NLS, this replacement should not change the cytoplasmic sequestration of the protein. The result, however, showed that p53K305 restored nuclear import when NLSI was substituted by Tag NLS (Fig. 3), suggesting that NLSI is a weak monopartite NLS compared with the Tag NLS. These data confirmed that two basic domains, Lys305–Arg306 and NLSI, are both required for nuclear import of p53. Taken together, these data indicate that a bipartite-like NLS is required for p53 nuclear import.Figure 3Effect of NLSI replacement by SV40 large T antigen (Tag NLS) on the subcellular localization of Lys305-mutated p53. The GFP fusion proteins of wild-type (a) and mutated p53 proteins including K319A/K320A/K321A (b), K305N (c), and replacement of NLSI by Tag NLS (d) were expressed in MCF-7 cells, and the subcellular localization of each fusion protein was determined by GFP fluorescence.

The italic letters indicate the mutated amino acid residues.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) It has been shown that deletion of any region from residues 326 to 355, the so-called cytoplasmic sequestration domain (CSD), results in entry of Lys305 or Arg306 mutated p53 into the nucleus (23Liang S.H. Hong D. Clarke M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19817-19821Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 24Liang S.H. Clarke M.F. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 2163-2166Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). It is possible that the CSD could inhibit the nuclear import of p53 by masking the NLS and block the binding of importin α. To test this hypothesis, we first performed a binding assay using in vitro translated importin α and recombinant GST fusion proteins of either wild-type (WT) or p53 mutations of Lys305, the CSD, or both. The GST fusions with SV40 Tag NLS (GST-NLS) and an inverse version of Tag NLS (GST-NLSinv) served as positive and negative controls, respectively, for the importin α binding. As shown in Fig.4, p53K305, which accumulates in the cytoplasm of MCF-7 cells, had 3-fold less binding to importin α compared with that of WT p53. Deletion of part of the CSD (residues 346–350), however, enhanced the binding of p53K305 to importin α by 2-fold. This suggests that the in vivo data showing that CSD-deleted p53K305 restored nuclear import ability (23Liang S.H. Hong D. Clarke M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19817-19821Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) can be explained by increased binding of the CSD mutant to importin α. In WT p53, deletion of the CSD also increased binding to importin α by ∼3-fold (Fig. 4). There is a weak but detectable binding of importin α to the p53 with the NLS (residues 305–322) deletion. This may result from binding of importin α to the NLSII and NLSIII in the carboxyl terminus (18Shaulsky G. Goldfinger N. Ben-Ze'ev A. Rotter V. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 6565-6577Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar) of p53 or a nonspecific binding to the mutant. Nonetheless, these data indicate that the CSD can inhibit the binding of importin α to p53. To delineate the role that the CSD plays in p53 nuclear import in the cell, we analyzed the localization of transiently transfected GFP fusions of WT p53 and CSD-deleted mutants in MCF-7, H1299, and Saos-2 cells. The subcellular localizations of the varied mutant and wild-type p53 proteins, as determined by GFP fluorescence, were scored and divided into three groups as nuclear (N), cytoplasmic (C), and both nuclear and cytoplasmic (N + C) accumulation. The percentage of each localization was determined from a total of ∼500 fluorescent cells observed in several fields of a slide. The results showed that although WT p53 was distributed predominantly in both the nucleus and the cytoplasm of an individual cell, the CSD-deleted mutants primarily exhibited the nuclear localization, although the percentage of distribution varied in different cell lines (Table II). The cellular localization of a p53 mutant with the deletion outside of the CSD region (residues 356–365) did not show a significant difference from that of WT p53 (Table II). This result supports the observation that the CSD could block the binding of importin α to the NLS and hence reduce the efficiency of p53 nuclear import.Table IISubcellular localization of mutated p53 in MCF-7, HI299, and Saos-2 cellsCellsMutations of p53Localization2-aCells were analyzed 1 day after transfection with GFP fusion constructs using LipofectAMINE.

Open table in a new tab Due to the fact that the CSD contains the p53 oligomerization domain (31Pavletich N.P. Chambers K.A. Pabo C.O. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 2556-2564Crossref PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar, 32Stürzbecher H.-W. Maimets T. Chumakov P. Brain R. Addison C. Simanis V. Rudge K. Philp R. Grimaldi M. Court W. Jenkins J.R. Oncogene. 1990; 5: 795-801PubMed Google Scholar), it is possible that the blocking effect of the CSD on nuclear import is a result of oligomerization of p53 protein. To test this possibility, MCF-7 cells were co-transfected with the GFP fusion of WT p53 or p53K305 and a FLAG-tagged construct (residues 325–369) consisting of the oligomerization domain. The localization of WT p53 or p53K305 and the oligomerization domain peptide were differentiated by GFP fluorescence and immunostaining of FLAG tags. The results showed that the oligomerization domain itself was distributed to both the nucleus and the cytoplasm (Fig. 5). When co-transfected with WT p53-GFP, the oligomerization domain exclusively accumulated in the nucleus as did WT p53-GFP (Fig. 5). Because this oligomerization domain contains no NLS, it must rely on the p53 NLS to enter the nucleus, suggesting that oligomerization of p53 does not block the p53 nuclear import. Our data also showed that the oligomerization domain accumulated in the cytoplasm together with p53K305 (Fig. 5). Taken together, these data indicate that the blocking effect of the CSD on p53 nuclear import is not associated with p53 oligomerization. Three novel findings about p53 subcellular localization are demonstrated in this study. First, the nuclear localization signal of p53 is bipartite. Second, a CSD from residues 326 to 355 can reduce the efficiency of p53 nuclear import by blocking the binding of NLS to importin α. Third, p53 can enter the nucleus as an oligomerized complex. These observations extend our previous studies that identified a basic domain, Lys305–Arg306, required for p53 nuclear import. We show here that this domain works together with NLSI (PQPKKKP) to bind to importin α and direct p53 to the nucleus. The NLSI was originally considered as a functional NLS based upon the observation that NLSI is sufficient to direct the nuclear import of PK when it was linked at the amino terminus of PK and transfected into COS-7 cells (19Dang C.V. Lee W.M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 18019-18023Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The NLSI motif may function as an NLS (19Dang C.V. Lee W.M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 18019-18023Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), but due to the CSD in the p53 protein, it is an extremely weak NLS resulting from a weak binding to importin α. Therefore, the activity of the p53 NLS is dependent on the protein context within which it is located. The replacement of NLSI with the Tag NLS could restore the nuclear import of Lys305-mutated p53, further demonstrating that NLSI itself is a rather weak NLS. The Lys305–Arg306domain separated from the NLSI by 9 amino acids is necessary for binding to importin α and p53 nuclear import. This redefines the NLS of p53 as a bipartite NLS (305KRALPNNTSSSPQPKKKP322). This bipartite NLS, however, is different from that of nucleoplasmin (TableI) whose upstream Lys residue can be substituted by another basic residue, Arg, without affecting its nuclear transport (33Robbins J. Dilworth S.M. Laskey R.A. Dingwall C. Cell. 1991; 64: 615-623Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1249) Google Scholar). Our previous study showed that mutation of Lys305 to Arg or Arg306 to Lys could not restore the ability of p53 nuclear import (24Liang S.H. Clarke M.F. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 2163-2166Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Deletion of the CSD enhances the binding of p53 to importin α and increases the efficiency of p53 nuclear import, indicating that the CSD can regulate p53 cellular trafficking by controlling its entrance into the nucleus. The CSD also contains an oligomerization domain (31Pavletich N.P. Chambers K.A. Pabo C.O. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 2556-2564Crossref PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar, 32Stürzbecher H.-W. Maimets T. Chumakov P. Brain R. Addison C. Simanis V. Rudge K. Philp R. Grimaldi M. Court W. Jenkins J.R. Oncogene. 1990; 5: 795-801PubMed Google Scholar) and a functional nuclear export signal (NES, see Ref. 20Stommel J.M. Marchenko N.D. Jimenez G.S. Moll U.M. Hope T.J. Wahl G.M. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1660-1672Crossref PubMed Scopus (607) Google Scholar). Several lines of evidence suggest that oligomerization and nuclear export of p53 are not involved in the control of p53 nuclear import by the CSD. First, inhibition of protein nuclear export mediated by CRM1 could not rescue the nuclear import of Lys305-mutated p53 which, however, happened when the CSD was deleted (Fig. 1 and Ref. 23Liang S.H. Hong D. Clarke M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19817-19821Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Second, a deletion in the CSD region (residues 326–335), but not within the NES (residues 340–351), increased the efficiency of p53 nuclear import (Table II), indicating that the blocking of p53 nuclear import by the CSD is not solely the counter effect of the NES residing in the CSD. Third, association of a peptide (residues 325–369) consisting of the p53 oligomerization domain with the p53 protein has no effect on p53 nuclear import (Fig.5), indicating that the blocking of p53 nuclear import by the CSD does not result from oligomerization of p53 through this domain. The in vitro binding assay indicated that the CSD can structurally mask the access of importin α to the NLS of p53. It is likely that this masking is regulated in the cell via a change in protein conformation, thus the CSD may serve as a guarding sequence for the activity of p53 by controlling the availability of the NLS to importin α. Although it is still unclear how the cellular trafficking of p53 is regulated by the cell, studies have indicated that protein synthesis is required for the nucleo-cytoplasmic transport of p53 protein (34Gannon J.V. Lane D.P. Nature. 1991; 349: 802-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 35Takahashi K. Sumimoto H. Suzuki K. Ono T. Mol. Carcinogen. 1993; 8: 58-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). We have observed in this study that the effect of the CSD is varied in different cell lines. Taken together, these results imply the existence of a mechanism involved in the regulation of CSD function, and this regulation is cell type-dependent. It will be interesting to see if there is any upstream signal or molecule involved in the regulation of CSD function.

The rapid release of Ca2+ is mediated by Ca2+ release channels, also known as ryanodine receptors (RyRs), because they bind the plant alkaloid ryanodine with high affinity and specificity (1Franzini-Armstrong C.

In striated muscles, RyRs are concentrated in the junctional SR membrane near transverse tubular, voltage-sensitive l-type Ca2+ channels (dihydropyridine receptors). A muscle action potential initiates dihydropyridine receptor conformational changes that activate the RyRs via a direct physical interaction in skeletal muscle or mediate the influx of Ca2+ in cardiac muscle, leading to the release of Ca2+ from the SR and subsequent muscle contraction. Both RyRs have been isolated as 30 S protein complexes composed of four 560-kDa (RyR polypeptide) and four 12-kDa (FK506-binding protein) subunits (1Franzini-Armstrong C. Protasi F. Physiol.

The two channel activities are affected by endogenous and exogenous effectors, such as Ca2+, Mg2+, ATP, caffeine, ryanodine, and ruthenium red. Ruthenium red (RR) is one of the most potent inhibitors of SR Ca2+ release (2Zucchi R. Ronca-Testoni S. Pharmacol. Rev. 1997; 49: 1-51PubMed Google Scholar). RR also inhibits mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake. However, this activity was due to a contaminant (7Reed K.C. Bygrave F.L. FEBS Lett. 1974; 46: 109-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) that may be related to an oxygen-bridged R360 complex that, at concentrations as high as 10 μm, was without effect on SR Ca2+ uptake or release (8Matlib A.M.

In muscle fibers, RR concentrations greater than 20 μm are required to inhibit SR Ca2+release because of RR binding to myoplasmic proteins (19Baylor S.M. Hollingworth S. Marshall M.W. J.

In intact single frog twitch muscle fibers, the estimated free RR concentration for half-block of SR Ca2+ release was 2.4 μm, in good agreement with the range reported for SR vesicle preparations (19Baylor S.M.

In [3H]ryanodine binding measurements, RR decreased the B max value and increased the K D value, with the latter effect being due to a slower association rate (16Chu A. Diaz-Munoz M. Hawkes M.J.

In single channel measurements, micromolar concentrations of RR decreased the channel open probability of the skeletal (21Smith J.S. Coronado R. Meissner G.

A different effect was observed when ryanodine was used to lock the channels into a permanently open, Ca2+-insensitive subconductance state. RR blocked single ryanodine-modified skeletal RyRs by binding in a voltage-dependent manner to multiple sites located in the conductance pore of the channel (23Ma J. J. Gen.

The effects of RR on RyRs were investigated in SR Ca2+ uptake, [3H]ryanodine binding, and single channel measurements using SR vesicles and purified cardiac and skeletal muscle RyRs. The results show that RR modifies the gating and conductance of the RyRs by multiple mechanisms, depending on channel activity, membrane potential, and sidedness of RR addition. [3H]Ryanodine was purchased from NEN Life Science Products. Unlabeled ryanodine was obtained from Calbiochem (San Diego, CA), ruthenium red was from Fluka (Ronkonkoma, NY), and phospholipids were from Avanti Polar Lipids (Alabaster, AL). Ryanodine and ruthenium red were prepared as concentrated stock solutions in 0.25 m KCl, 20 mm KHepes, pH 7.4, before their use. All other chemicals were of analytical grade. “Heavy” rabbit skeletal and canine cardiac muscle SR membrane fractions enriched in [3H]ryanodine binding and Ca2+ release channel activities were prepared in the presence of protease inhibitors (100 nm aprotinin, 1 μm leupeptin, 1 μm pepstatin, 1 mm benzamidine, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) as described (14Meissner G.

The 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonate (CHAPS)-solubilized 30 S RyR complexes were isolated by rate density gradient centrifugation and reconstituted into proteoliposomes by removal of CHAPS by dialysis (25Lee H.-B.

Samples were incubated for 1 h at 24 °C in 0.25 m KCl, 20 mm KHepes, pH 7.4, solutions containing 50 μm Ca2+, 0.2 mm Pefabloc, and 20 μm leupeptin in the absence of ryanodine or the presence of 300 μm ryanodine to close the SR Ca2+ release channel (26Jones L.R.

At various times, aliquots of the samples were placed on 0.45 μm Millipore filters under vacuum and rinsed with three 1-ml volumes of a 0.25 m KCl, 5 mm KPipes, pH 6.8, solution containing 0.1 mm EGTA, 10 mm Mg2+, and 10 μm RR. Radioactivity remaining with the vesicles on the filters was counted by liquid scintillation. Unless otherwise indicated, SR vesicles were incubated for 20–24 h at 24 °C in 0.25m KCl, 20 mm KHepes, pH 7.4, solutions containing 0.2 mm Pefabloc, 20 μm leupeptin, 1 nm [3H]ryanodine, and various RR and free Ca2+ concentrations. Nonspecific [3H]ryanodine binding was determined using a 1000-fold excess of unlabeled ryanodine. Aliquots of the samples were diluted with 10 volumes of ice-cold water and placed on Whatman GF/B filters soaked with 2% polyethyleneimine. Filters were washed with three 5-ml volumes of ice-cold 0.1 m KCl, 1 mm KPipes, pH 7.0. Radioactivity remaining with the filters was determined by liquid scintillation counting to obtain bound [3H]ryanodine. Hill constants (K i ) and coefficients (n i ) of [3H]ryanodine binding inhibition by RR were determined using the following equation, B=B0/(1+([RR]/Ki)ni)Equation 1 where B is [3H]ryanodine binding at a given [RR], and B o is the binding maximum in the absence of RR. Single channel measurements were performed by fusing proteoliposomes containing the purified RyRs with Mueller-Rudin type bilayers containing phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylserine, and phosphatidylcholine in the ratio 5:3:2 (25 mg of total phospholipid per ml ofn-decane) (30Tripathy A. Resch W. Xu L. Valdivia H.H. Meissner G. J. Gen. Physiol. 1998; 111: 679-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The side of the bilayer to which the proteoliposomes were added was designated as the cis side. The trans side was defined as ground. Single channels were recorded in symmetric KCl buffer solutions (0.25 m KCl, 10–20 mm KHepes, pH 7.4) with additions as indicated in the text. Unless otherwise indicated, electrical signals were filtered at 2–4 kHz, digitized at 10–20 kHz, and analyzed as described (30Tripathy A. Resch W. Xu L. Valdivia H.H. Meissner G. J. Gen. Physiol. 1998; 111: 679-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Data acquisition and analysis were performed using a commercially available software package (pClamp 6.0.3, Axon Instruments, Burlingame, CA) and an IBM-compatible computer (Pentium processor) with 12-bit analog/digital-digital/analog converter (Digidata 1200, Axon Instruments). In the absence of RR-related subconductance states, channel open probability in the absence of a substate (P o) was obtained by setting the threshold level at 50% of the current amplitude between the closed (c) and open (o) states. P o values in multichannel recordings were calculated according to the equation P o = Σ iP i /N, where N is the total number of channels, and P i is the ichannel open probability. In some conditions, RR formed a predominant reduced conductance level (see Fig. 9 A, right panel, bottom trace, s). RR formed additional subconductance states, but with some exceptions (see Figs. 6 D and 7 B), these occurred infrequently and were not further analyzed. The concentration and voltage dependence of the RR-related subconductances were obtained by determining the open probability of the full conductance events (P full), RR-related subconductance events (P sub), and the sum ofP full and P sub(P tot) (31Tinker A. Lindsay A.R.G. Williams A.J. Biophys. J. 1992; 61: 1122-1132Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). P full was obtained by setting the threshold level at 50% current amplitude between subconductance (s) and open (o) current levels (see Fig. 9 A, right panel, bottom trace). This measurement eliminated inclusion of substates inP full. P tot was obtained by setting the threshold level at 50% of the current between the close (c) and subconductance (s) current levels (see Fig. 9 A, right panel, bottom trace). The open probability of the subconductance state, P sub, was obtained by the equation P sub = P tot− P full.Figure 6Effects of cytosolic and lumenal RR on single RyR1s.

In the presence of substates, the Hill association constant (K a ) and coefficient (n a) of P sub state were determined by the following equation. Psub=Ptot/(1+(Ka/[RR])na)Equation 3 Assuming a Boltzman distribution between theP full and P sub states, their voltage dependence was described by the following equation, Psub/Pfull=exp[(ZtotFV−Gi)/RT]Equation 4 where Z tot is the effective gating charge of the reaction of RR with the RyR. The other terms have their usual meanings. Free Ca2+ concentrations ⋝1 μm were determined using a Ca2+ selective electrode (Nico Scientific, Philadelphia, PA). Free Ca2+ concentrations of <1 μm were obtained by including in the solutions the appropriate amounts of Ca2+ and EGTA as determined using the stability constants and the mixed solution program published by Schoenmakers et al. (32Schoenmakers J.M. Visser G.J. Flick G. Theuvene A.P.R. BioTechniques. 1992; 12: 870-879PubMed Google Scholar). The effects of RR on RyR ion channel activity were assessed in SR vesicle-45Ca2+ uptake measurements. Skeletal muscle SR vesicles of high buoyant density (previously designated heavy SR vesicles, Ref. 24Meissner G. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 2365-2374Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) were actively loaded in 0.25 m KCl medium containing 0.2 μm (Fig.1 A) and 20 μm(Fig. 1 B) free 45Ca2+. The SR Ca2+ pump is present in these vesicles, but only 70–90% have RyR1 (24Meissner G. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 2365-2374Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To prevent release of sequestered45Ca2+, RyR1 was fully closed prior to45Ca2+ uptake by incubation for 1 h with 300 μm ryanodine (26Jones L.R. Cala S.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 11809-11818Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 27Fleischer S. Ogunbunmi E.M. Dixon M.C. Fleer E.A.M. Proc. Natl. Acad Sci. U. S.

Res. 1989; 65: 1400-1408Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). In the absence of RR, pretreatment with ryanodine increased the levels of45Ca2+ sequestered by the vesicles 3-fold in uptake medium containing 0.2 or 20 μm free Ca2+. In ryanodine-untreated vesicles at 0.2 μm Ca2+, 1 μm RR doubled the amount of 45Ca2+ taken up by the vesicles. 10 μm RR was nearly as effective as pretreatment with ryanodine in increasing 45Ca2+ uptake. By contrast, at 20 μm Ca2+, 50 μmRR was required to achieve Ca2+ uptake levels approaching those observed in ryanodine-treated vesicles. RR did not increase45Ca2+ uptake by vesicles pretreated with ryanodine. For ryanodine-treated vesicles, a small decrease in the45Ca2+ uptake rate was observed in the presence of 50 μm RR, in agreement with the suggestion that high levels of RR inhibit the SR Ca2+ pump (33Kargacin G.J. Ali Z. Kargacin M.E. Pfluegers Arch. 1998; 436: 338-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The effects of RR on Ca2+ uptake levels of ryanodine-treated and -untreated skeletal and cardiac SR vesicles were compared. 45Ca2+ uptake levels were determined after an uptake period of 2 min. Cardiac SR contained a smaller proportion of vesicles responding to treatment with ryanodine (Fig.2), in accordance with a 4–5-fold lowerB max value of [3H]ryanodine binding for cardiac than skeletal SR vesicles (see Fig. 5). Ryanodine significantly increased 45Ca2+ uptake or cardiac SR vesicles at 20 μm Ca2+(p < 0.05; n = 4) but not at 0.2 μm Ca2+ (p = 0.1). In ryanodine-untreated SR vesicles, RR was more effective at 0.2 μm than at 20 μm Ca2+ in raising 45Ca2+ uptake to levels in the ryanodine-treated vesicles. In agreement with previous vesicle ion flux measurements (9Ohnishi S.T. J. Biochem. 1979; 86: 1147-1150Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 10Miyamoto H. Racker E.

Ther. 1991; 256: 938-946PubMed Google Scholar), the results indicate that the skeletal and cardiac muscle RyRs are inhibited by RR. The data in Fig. 2 further show that the extent of inhibition depends on the Ca2+concentration of the uptake medium. Two possible reasons for this Ca2+ dependence are that SR Ca2+ pump activity is dependent on Ca2+ concentration and/or that Ca2+ ions compete with RR for the Ca2+regulatory sites on the RyRs.Figure 5Scatchard analysis of [3H]ryanodine binding to skeletal muscle (A) and cardiac muscle (B) SR vesicles in the presence and absence of RR.

[3H]Ryanodine binding is widely used as a probe of channel activity because of its preferential binding to open RyR ion channel states (1Franzini-Armstrong C. Protasi F. Physiol. Rev. 1997; 77: 699-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (592) Google Scholar, 2Zucchi R. Ronca-Testoni S. Pharmacol. Rev. 1997; 49: 1-51PubMed Google Scholar, 3Sutko J.L. Airey J.A. Physiol.

Fig. 3 compares the Ca2+ dependence of [3H]ryanodine binding to skeletal and cardiac muscle SR vesicles in 0.25 m KCl solutions containing varying concentrations of RR. In the absence of RR, two bell-shaped activation/inactivation curves were obtained. In agreement with previous reports (1Franzini-Armstrong C. Protasi F. Physiol. Rev. 1997; 77: 699-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (592) Google Scholar, 2Zucchi R. Ronca-Testoni S. Pharmacol. Rev. 1997; 49: 1-51PubMed Google Scholar, 3Sutko J.L. Airey J.A. Physiol.

Physiol. 1994; 56: 485-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (842) Google Scholar), the binding data indicate that RyR1 and RyR2 are activated by Ca2+ binding to cytosolic high affinity receptor sites and inhibited by Ca2+ binding to low affinity sites, with higher Ca2+ concentrations required to inhibit RyR2. Higher RR concentrations were required to inhibit [3H]ryanodine binding to RyR2 than RyR1 (Fig. 3). RR decreased the amounts of [3H]ryanodine bound without markedly changing the Ca2+ dependence of [3H]ryanodine binding. The effects of RR concentration on [3H]ryanodine binding were determined at 2.5, 15, and 200 μm Ca2+and at 15 μm free Ca2+ in the presence of the nonhydrolyzable ATP analog AMPPCP. We also tested conditions comparable to those in Figs. 1 and 2 by using solutions that contained 5 mm MgAMPPCP and 20 μm or 200 μmfree Ca2+. In the absence of RR, the highest binding of [3H]ryanodine to RyR1 was observed at 15 μmfree Ca2+ and 5 mm AMPPCP (Fig.4 A) and to RyR2 at 200 μm Ca2+ (Fig. 4 B). The results agree with single channel measurements that μmCa2+ and mm ATP optimally activate RyR1, whereas RyR2 is nearly fully activated by μmCa2+ alone (see Figs. 6 C and 9 A). RR inhibited [3H]ryanodine binding to RyR1 and RyR2 in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 4). Solid lines in Fig. 4 were obtained by fitting the [3H]ryanodine binding data to Equation 1. The average Hill inhibition constants (K i ) and coefficients (n i ) (TableI) indicate that RR was more effective in inhibiting [3H]ryanodine binding at 2.5 μmCa2+ than at 15 μm or 200 μmCa2+. The binding data could not be fitted when it was assumed that RR inhibited [3H]ryanodine binding by competing with Ca2+ for the Ca2+ activation sites via a competitive mechanism (not shown). RR was least effective in inhibiting the RyRs in 15 μm Ca2+ medium containing 5 mm AMPPCP (Fig. 4 and Table I). Similarly, the presence of 5 mm MgAMPPCP decreased the effectiveness of RR in inhibiting [3H]ryanodine binding to RyR1 and RyR2. Scatchard analysis of two sets of binding data from Fig. 4 indicated that RR inhibited [3H]ryanodine binding by decreasing theB max and K D values (Fig.5). Taken together, the [3H]ryanodine binding data suggest that RR inhibits RyR1 and RyR2 by noncompetitive interactions between RyR Ca2+regulatory and RR inhibition sites.Table IEffects of RR on [ 3 H]ryanodine binding to RyR1 and RyR2ConditionRyR1RyR2K in iK in inmnm2.5 μm Ca2+49 ± 16 (3)1.5 ± 0.3 (3)16 ± 2 (3)1.0 ± 0.1 (3)15 μm Ca2+91 ± 44 (5)1.3 ± 0.2 (5)156 ± 103 (6)1.1 ± 0.2 (6)200 μm Ca2+109 ± 49 (5)1.3 ± 0.2 (5)434 ± 187 (8)1.1 ± 0.3 (8)15 μm Ca2+ + 5 mmAMPPCP2970 ± 1620 (3)1.5 ± 0.2 (3)5920 ± 390 (3)0.7 ± 0.1 (3)20 μm Ca2++ 5 mm MgAMPPCP660 ± 240 (3)1.1 ± 0.2 (3)3420 ± 1000 (3)1.0 ± 0.2 (3)200 μm Ca2+ + 5 mmMgAMPPCP—1-a—, not determined.—4150 ± 1300 (3)0.9 ± 0.2 (3)Hill inhibition constants (K i ) and coefficients (n i ) were obtained as indicated in the legend to Fig. 4.

Proteoliposomes containing purified RyR were fused with planar lipid bilayers. A strong dependence of single channel activities on cis-Ca2+ concentration indicated that the large cytosolic region of the channels faced thecis (cytosolic) chamber in a majority (>98%) of the recordings (34Xu L.

The majority of channels were recorded in symmetric 0.25 m KCl solutions rather than with a lumenal Ca2+ solution to eliminate large Ca2+ gradients near the cytosolic channel pore sites (34Xu L.

This helical face was proposed to form a site of PLN interaction with a transmembrane helix in SERCA molecules. To determine whether predicted transmembrane helices M4, M5, M6, or M8 in SERCA1a interact with PLN, SERCA1a mutants were co-expressed with wild-type PLN and effects on Ca2+dependence of Ca2+ transport were measured. Wild-type inhibitory interactions shifted apparent Ca2+ affinity of SERCA1a by an average of −0.34 pCa units, but four of the seven mutations in M4 led to a more inhibitory shift in apparent Ca2+ affinity, averaging −0.53 pCa units. Seven mutations in M5 led to an average shift of −0.32 pCa units and seven mutations in M8 led to an average shift of −0.30pCa units. Among 11 mutations in M6, 1, Q791A, increased the inhibitory shift (−0.59 pCa units) and 5, V795A (−0.11), L802A (−0.07), L802V (−0.04), T805A (−0.11), and F809A (−0.12), reduced the inhibitory shift, consistent with the view that Val795, Leu802, Thr805, and Phe809, located on one face of a predicted M6 helix, form a site in SERCA1a for interaction with PLN. Those mutations in M4, M6, or M8 of SERCA1a that enhanced PLN inhibitory function did not enhance PLN physical association with SERCA1a, but mutants V795A and L802A in M6, which decreased PLN inhibitory function, decreased physical association, as measured by co-immunoprecipitation. In related studies, those PLN mutants that gained inhibitory function also increased levels of co-immunoprecipitation of wild-type SERCA1a and those that lost inhibitory function also reduced association, correlating functional interaction sites with physical interaction sites. Thus, both functional and physical data confirm that PLN interacts with M6 SERCA1a. In an earlier study (Kimura, Y., Kurzydlowski, K., Tada, M., and MacLennan, D. H. (1997)J. Biol.

Odermatt A. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1997; 834: 175-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). A structural model for SERCA1a at 8 Å illustrates that the transmembrane domain contains 10 transmembrane helices, M1–M10 (4Zhang P. Toyoshima C. Yonekura K. Green N.M. Stokes D.L. Nature. 1998; 392: 835-839Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). Four of these predicted helices, M4, M5, M6, and M8, were proposed to form two Ca2+ binding sites (5Clarke D.M. Loo T.W. Inesi G. MacLennan D.H. Nature. 1989; 339: 476-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar), but subsequent analysis has led to the proposal that the two Ca2+ binding sites lie side-by-side within a right-handed, coiled-coil structure formed by helices M4, M5, and M6 (1MacLennan D.H. Rice W.J. Green N.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28815-28818Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar, 6Rice W.J. Green N.M. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31412-31419Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). A three-membered, right-handed coiled-coil has been resolved at 8 Å among the helices that make up the transmembrane domain of SERCA1a in the study of Zhang et al. (4Zhang P. Toyoshima C. Yonekura K. Green N.M. Stokes D.L. Nature. 1998; 392: 835-839Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). In a cross-sectional representation of this group of predicted helices in the transmembrane domain of SERCA1a, M5 and M6 have one surface exposed to the lipid bilayer, but M4 and M8 appear to be more completely surrounded by other helices (4Zhang P. Toyoshima C. Yonekura K. Green N.M. Stokes D.L. Nature. 1998; 392: 835-839Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). Phospholamban (PLN) is a 52-amino acid, integral membrane protein that interacts with and, at low Ca2+ concentrations, reversibly inhibits the activity of the cardiac Ca2+-ATPase isoform, SERCA2a, by lowering its apparent affinity for Ca2+ (7Simmerman H.K. Jones L.R. Physiol. Rev. 1998; 78: 921-947Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar). In its role as a regulator of the activity of the Ca2+ pump, PLN is a major regulator of the kinetics of cardiac contractility (8Luo W. Grupp I.L. Harrer J. Ponniah S. Grupp G. Duffy J.J. Doetschman T. Kranias E.G. Circ. Res. 1994; 75: 401-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (630) Google Scholar,9Koss K.L. Kranias E.G. Circ. Res. 1996; 79: 1059-1063Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). PLN has been predicted to contain three domains. Domain IA, amino acids 1–20, is largely helical (10Mortishire-Smith R.J. Pitzenberger S.M. Burke C.J. Middaugh C.R. Garsky V.M. Johnson R.G. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 7603-7613Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) and contains sites of regulatory phosphorylation by protein kinase A at Ser16 and by calmodulin kinase at Thr17 (11Simmerman H.K.

Invest. 1987; 79: 301-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Domain IB, amino acids 21–30, is unstructured and contains a high proportion of amidated residues. Domain II, amino acids 31–52, forms a transmembrane helix. Our investigations of structure/function relationships in PLN, in which we have identified clusters of amino acids in which mutation causes loss of the ability of PLN to diminish the apparent Ca2+affinity of SERCA2a molecules, have allowed us to conclude that there are two, and possibly three, sites through which SERCA2a and PLN interact (13Toyofuku T.

Reconstitution of PLN inhibition with soluble PLN domain I peptides has failed to show that domain I can affect the affinity of SERCA2a for Ca2+ (18Sasaki T. Inui M. Kimura Y. Kuzuya T. Tada M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1674-1679Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Jones L.R. Field L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11486-11488Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Hughes G.

Kurzydlowski K. Tada M. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3088-3094Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Kimura Y. Asahi M. Kurzydlowski K. Tada M. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14238-14241Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Since domain IB-domain II constructs, from which residues 1–27 were removed or replaced, retained the ability to lower the affinity of SERCA2a for Ca2+ (15Kimura Y. Kurzydlowski K. Tada M. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21726-21731Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar), it seems clear that inhibitory interactions that reduce SERCA2a Ca2+ affinity do occur in transmembrane sequences of PLN and SERCA2a and/or in a few residues at the cytoplasmic surface of the transmembrane domains (16Kimura Y. Kurzydlowski K. Tada M. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15061-15064Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar,17Kimura Y. Asahi M. Kurzydlowski K. Tada M. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14238-14241Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). On the basis of these results, we have proposed that PLN and SERCA2a interact via a four-base circuit through which long range inhibitory interactions might be propagated among a series of cytoplasmic and transmembrane interaction sites (16Kimura Y. Kurzydlowski K. Tada M. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15061-15064Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). Since PLN exists in both pentameric and monomeric states (22Jones L.R. Simmerman H.K. Wilson W.W. Gurd F.R. Wegener A.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 7721-7730Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), it is an important question whether inhibitory interactions between PLN and SERCA2a occur through PLN monomers or pentamers. Alanine-scanning mutagenesis of PLN domain II (16Kimura Y. Kurzydlowski K. Tada M. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15061-15064Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar, 23Adams P.D. Arkin I.T. Engelman D.M. Brunger A.T. Nat. Struct.

Chem. 1996; 271: 5941-5946Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar) has demonstrated that mutations to one face of the transmembrane helix enhance monomer formation. The large concentration of Leu and Ile residues on this “PLN interaction face” has led to the postulate that the PLN pentamer is held together by a series of “leucine zippers” (25Simmerman H.K.B. Kobayashi Y.M. Autry J.M. Jones L.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5941-5946Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). In earlier analyses (16Kimura Y. Kurzydlowski K. Tada M. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15061-15064Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar, 26Autry J.M. Jones L.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15872-15880Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar) inhibitory function was greatly enhanced by those mutations in the transmembrane domain of PLN that led to monomerization. We proposed that the increase in monomer concentration led to increased inhibition through mass action, which would alter the equilibrium between inhibited and non-inhibited forms of SERCA2a, and, on this basis, we proposed that the monomer is the active form. Measurement of the effect of phosphorylation on the concentration of PLN monomers also supports the view that monomers are the active inhibitory species (27Cornea R.L. Jones L.R. Autry J.M. Thomas D.D. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 2960-2967Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Mutation of amino acids on the opposite face of the PLN domain II helix led to loss of the ability of PLN to inhibit SERCA2a, leading us to postulate that it formed a “SERCA interaction face” (16Kimura Y. Kurzydlowski K. Tada M. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15061-15064Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). In this study, we have used a similar approach to identify a PLN interaction face among the predicted transmembrane helices in SERCA1a. We have used SERCA1a instead of SERCA2a because SERCA1a and SERCA2a are equally inhibited by wild-type and mutant PLN (28Toyofuku T. Kurzydlowski K. Tada M. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2809-2815Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), because the sequences of transmembrane helices M4, M5, M6, and M8 are very highly conserved among all three SERCA isoforms (29Burk S.E. Lytton J. MacLennan D.H. Shull G.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 18561-18568Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), because structure/function analysis of SERCA1a is highly advanced, and because a large number of useful mutants derived from earlier alanine-scanning mutagenesis of SERCA1a transmembrane helices M4, M5, M6, and M8 (30Rice W.J. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31412-31419Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) were available for this study. The effects of specific mutations on functional interactions, together with studies of co-immunoprecipitation of wild-type and mutant PLN and SERCA1a, implicate SERCA1a transmembrane helix M6 and Val795 and Leu802, in particular, in the functional interaction between SERCA molecules and PLN. Enzymes for DNA manipulation were obtained from New England Biolabs and Amersham Pharmacia Biotech.35S-Labeled dATP and [45Ca]CaCl2were purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. G-Sepharose and a chemiluminescence kit for measurement of co-immunoprecipitation were purchased from Pierce. Site directed mutagenesis was carried out as described previously (31Kunkel T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 488-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (4900) Google Scholar). Wild-type and mutant SERCA1a cDNAs were ligated into theEcoRI site of the pMT2 expression vector (a generous gift from Dr. R. J. Kaufman). Wild-type and mutated PLN cDNAs were ligated into the XbaI and SalI sites of the pMT2 expression vector. Plasmid DNA was purified by absorption to and elution from Qiagen tip-500 columns. SERCA1a and/or PLN cDNAs were transfected into HEK-293 cells using the calcium phosphate precipitation method (32Kingston R.E. Chen C.A. Okayama H. Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, New York1990: 9.1.1-9.1.9Google Scholar) at a concentration of 8 μg of each cDNA/10-cm plate in standard experiments. Cells were harvested 48 h after transfection, and microsomes were prepared as described previously (33Maruyama K. MacLennan D.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 3314-3318Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). Microsomes were assayed for Ca2+ transport activity as described previously (34Toyofuku T. Kurzydlowski K. Lytton J. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 14490-14496Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Total protein was measured by the method of Bradford (35Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216357) Google Scholar) with bovine serum albumin as the standard. Data were analyzed for statistical significance using Student's unpaired t test. To quantitate association between SERCA1a and PLN, microsomes at 1 mg/ml protein in 0.25 msucrose, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 20 μmCaCl2, 3 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 150 mm KCl were mixed with an equal volume of 40 mmHEPES-NaOH, pH 7.5, 300 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 4 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1% Tween 20, vortexed for 30 s, and centrifuged in an Eppendorf 5415C centrifuge for 30 min at 16,000 × g. The supernatants were rotated with bovine serum albumin-treated G-Sepharose for 30 min and centrifuged to remove proteins bound nonspecifically to G-Sepharose. The supernatants were then mixed with a G-Sepharose/PLN monoclonal antibody 1D11 complex, specific for an epitope between PLN residues 7 and 17. The samples were rotated for 30 min and centrifuged, and pellets were washed three times with a buffer composed of 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 0.5% Tween 20. The samples were loaded on 8% polyacrylamide gels, and proteins were separated using standard SDS-PAGE protocols (36Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207200) Google Scholar) and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. After blocking with a skim milk suspension, the membranes were treated with anti-SERCA1a monoclonal antibody A52, specific for an epitope between residues 657 and 672 in SERCA1a (37Zubrzycka-Gaarn E. MacDonald G. Phillips L. Jorgensen A.O. MacLennan D.H. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1984; 16: 441-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), washed in Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20 (Tris-buffered saline/0.1% Tween), and treated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse secondary antibody (Promega). Membranes were washed in Tris-buffered saline/0.1% Tween, and the signals were detected with an enhanced chemiluminescence kit (Pierce Super Signal) The SERCA1a-PLN complex was quantified by scanning densitometry of each lane in the exposed films using a Kodak X-Omat Processor. The experiments could not be carried out in reverse order, since A52 did not precipitate SERCA1a under the conditions outlined above. Protein expression levels in all experiments were estimated by immunoblotting using antibodies A52 and 1D11. In earlier studies, we showed that mutations on one face of the PLN transmembrane helix caused loss of functional interaction with SERCA2a (16Kimura Y. Kurzydlowski K. Tada M. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15061-15064Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). We deduced that mutations in the face of the transmembrane helix in SERCA2a that interacted with PLN would show a complementary loss of functional interaction. To test this hypothesis, we coexpressed wild-type PLN with a series of SERCA1a molecules carrying individual mutations on the hydrophobic face of helices M4, M5, M6, or M8. In each experiment, expression was monitored by immunoblotting with monoclonal antibody A52 against SERCA1a and with monoclonal antibody 1D11 against PLN. The results indicated that all of the mutants were expressed to about the same extent as wild-type SERCA1a. However, the activities of some potentially interesting mutants such as V798A or V798S were reduced relative to wild-type, so that functional analysis could not be carried out (30Rice W.J. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31412-31419Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). As an assay for functional interaction, we measured the effect of each SERCA1a mutation on the Ca2+ dependence of Ca2+transport of SERCA1a co-expressed with wild-type PLN. Many of the SERCA1a mutations were characterized in an earlier study (30Rice W.J. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31412-31419Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Some of these mutations in SERCA1a increased or decreased apparent Ca2+ affinity (Table I), but, without exception, the apparent Ca2+ affinity of each mutant was diminished by co-expression with wild-type PLN (Table I and Fig. 1). For mutants V300A and V790A, a higher intrinsic Ca2+ affinity was associated with a higher inhibition by PLN, but for mutants V769A and G808A, a higher intrinsic Ca2+ affinity was associated with a slightly lower inhibition by PLN. For mutants V795A, T805A, and F809A, a lower intrinsic Ca2+ affinity was associated with a lower inhibition by PLN. However, mutants L802A and L802V, which were least inhibited by PLN, had intrinsic Ca2+ affinities values not significantly different from wild-type. Thus, there was no correlation between alterations of intrinsic Ca2+ affinity by SERCA1a mutations and alterations in the ability of the mutant SERCA1a to interact functionally with PLN.Table IK Ca of SERCA1a expressed in HEK-293 cells in the presence and absence of PLNHelixMutation−PLN+PLNΔK CaWTNone6.38 ± 0.036.04 ± 0.03−0.34 ± 0.01M4V300A6.64 ± 0.10**6.08 ± 0.10−0.56 ± 0.00**V304A6.48 ± 0.085.97 ± 0.07−0.51 ± 0.02**I307A5.74 ± 0.04**5.38 ± 0.05**−0.36 ± 0.02L311A6.23 ± 0.115.78 ± 0.11**−0.45 ± 0.04*V314A6.22 ± 0.05*5.90 ± 0.06−0.32 ± 0.05C318A6.40 ± 0.025.90 ± 0.09−0.50 ± 0.07**L321A6.28 ± 0.026.06 ± 0.03−0.22 ± 0.01**M5Q759A6.47 ± 0.086.08 ± 0.16−0.39 ± 0.08I761A6.07 ± 0.07**5.79 ± 0.07**−0.28 ± 0.01R762A6.17 ± 0.05**5.91 ± 0.07−0.26 ± 0.03V769A6.57 ± 0.02*6.28 ± 0.03**−0.29 ± 0.02V773A6.40 ± 0.066.12 ± 0.08−0.28 ± 0.02F776A6.17 ± 0.15*5.84 ± 0.13*−0.33 ± 0.03A780V6.36 ± 0.076.03 ± 0.07−0.33 ± 0.03M6V790A6.61 ± 0.03**6.17 ± 0.02−0.44 ± 0.02*Q791A6.26 ± 0.075.69 ± 0.10**−0.57 ± 0.06**V795A6.17 ± 0.02**6.06 ± 0.01−0.11 ± 0.01**L802A6.47 ± 0.096.40 ± 0.08**−0.07 ± 0.02**L802V6.25 ± 0.056.23 ± 0.04**−0.02 ± 0.03**T805A6.10 ± 0.07**5.95 ± 0.05−0.15 ± 0.02**A806V6.40 ± 0.026.01 ± 0.03−0.39 ± 0.04G808A6.56 ± 0.04*6.28 ± 0.04**−0.28 ± 0.01F809A6.01 ± 0.04**5.85 ± 0.05*−0.16 ± 0.02**P811A6.40 ± 0.066.04 ± 0.09−0.36 ± 0.06P812A6.28 ± 0.065.98 ± 0.07−0.30 ± 0.04M8T898A6.35 ± 0.086.04 ± 0.04−0.31 ± 0.05M899A6.38 ± 0.125.99 ± 0.14−0.39 ± 0.03S902A6.31 ± 0.125.99 ± 0.14−0.32 ± 0.05V903A6.32 ± 0.045.92 ± 0.04−0.40 ± 0.06C910A6.41 ± 0.035.93 ± 0.08−0.48 ± 0.06**L913A6.27 ± 0.055.95 ± 0.07−0.32 ± 0.02N914A6.07 ± 0.02**5.79 ± 0.09**−0.28 ± 0.08*, p < 0.05; **, p < 0.01 (against WT SERCA1a for −PLN column; against WT SERCA1a plus WT PLN for +PLN and ΔK Ca columns).

The interaction between wild-type PLN and SERCA1a reduced the apparent Ca2+ affinity of SERCA1a by −0.34 pCa units. Among seven mutations on the most hydrophobic face of M4, V300A, V304A, and C318A reduced apparent Ca2+ affinity by more than −0.34 pCa units. We refer to these mutants as enhancers of PLN inhibitory function. The mutation L321A reduced apparent Ca2+ affinity by less than −0.34 pCa units. We refer to this mutant as a reducer of PLN inhibitory function. Mutations V307A, L311A, and V314A reduced apparent Ca2+affinity by about −0.34 pCa unit. We refer to these mutants as non-effectors of PLN inhibitory function (Fig. 1 A). None of the seven mutations carried out on the most hydrophobic surface of M5 affected PLN inhibitory function (Fig. 1 B). A single mutation, C910A, in the most hydrophobic face of M8 led to enhancement of PLN inhibitory function, but six other mutations did not affect PLN inhibitory function (Fig. 1 D). By contrast, 5 of 11 mutations on the most hydrophobic face of M6, V795A, L802A, L802V, T805A, and F809A, reduced PLN inhibitory function and 1, Q791A, enhanced PLN inhibitory function (Fig. 1 C). These observations are consistent with the hypothesis that the hydrophobic face of M6 is the site in SERCA1a that interacts with the hydrophobic face of PLN. In order to obtain physical evidence for specific interaction sites between SERCA1a transmembrane helix M6 and the transmembrane helix of PLN, we attempted to form disulfide cross-links (6Rice W.J. Green N.M. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31412-31419Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) between amino acids in M6 and PLN predicted to be the most likely sites of PLN/SERCA1a transmembrane interactions. We co-expressed mutant SERCA1a (for example, mutant L802C) with mutant PLN (for example, L31C), isolated microsomal fractions and exposed the microsomes to conditions that would promote disulfide bonds to form between SERCA1a and PLN (6Rice W.J. Green N.M. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31412-31419Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). In these experiments, we explored whether cross-links might form between the following mutant proteins: L802C/L31C, L802C/N34C, L802C/F35C, L802C/I38C, L802C/L42C, L802C/I48C, L802C/V49C, L802C/L52C, T805C/N34C, T805C/F35C, T805C/I38C, F809C/L31C, F809C/N34C, and F809C/F35C. Unfortunately, we could not detect the formation of any cross-links in these hydrophobic regions of the two molecules. We then attempted to detect physical interaction by co-immunoprecipitation. Data presented in Fig.2 (A–C) illustrate that association of SERCA1a with PLN could be detected by co-immunoprecipitation using the PLN-specific antibody, 1D11, but association of PLN with SERCA1a could not be detected by co-immunoprecipitation using the SERCA1a-specific antibody because A52 did not immunoprecipitate SERCA1a. Data calculated from at least four replicates of experiments like those shown in Fig. 2 A are presented in Table II.Table IIEffects of SERCA1a mutations on co-immunoprecipitation of SERCA1a with PLNHelixSERCA1a mutantsΔK Ca2-aΔK Ca is defined in the legend to Fig. 1.Co-immunoprecipitation relative to wild type2-b*, p < 0.05 against wild type SERCA1a.nmeanmean ± S.E.M4V300A−0.591.07 ± 0.134V304A−0.510.98 ± 0.124L311A−0.450.96 ± 0.034C318A−0.501.05 ± 0.094L321A−0.220.80 ± 0.094M5V769A−0.290.97 ± 0.084A780V−0.331.28 ± 0.154M6Q791A−0.570.65 ± 0.186V795A−0.110.53 ± 0.10*7L802A−0.070.44 ± 0.07*6T805A−0.150.78 ± 0.116F809A−0.160.85 ± 0.134M8M899A−0.390.99 ± 0.224V903A−0.400.82 ± 0.1442-a ΔK Ca is defined in the legend to Fig. 1.2-b *, p < 0.05 against wild type SERCA1a. Open table in a new tab Associations between PLN and SERCA1a M6 mutants V795A, L802A, T805A, and F809A were all diminished. In particular, physical associations between PLN and SERCA1a mutants V795A and L802A, which were least able to interact functionally with PLN (Fig. 1), were reduced to 53% and 44%, respectively. The mutant Q791A, which enhanced PLN inhibitory function (Fig. 1), also had diminished ability to associate with PLN. By contrast, M4 mutants V300A, V304A, L311A, and C318A, which enhanced PLN inhibitory function, and M4 mutant L321A, which reduced PLN inhibitory function, all associated with PLN to about the same extent as wild-type SERCA1a. This was also true for M5 mutants V769A and A780V and M8 mutants M899A and V903A, which did not alter PLN inhibitory function. These data highlight M6 as the SERCA1a helix most likely to interact physically and functionally with the PLN transmembrane helix, resulting in SERCA1a inhibition. Our earlier studies illustrated that mutations in PLN domains IA, IB, and II can lead to either gain or loss of inhibitory function (13Toyofuku T. Kurzydlowski K. Tada M. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol.

Thus, it was of interest to use co-immunoprecipitation to test for physical association between SERCA1a and a variety of PLN mutants with differing effects on inhibitory function.

The signal-induced phosphorylation of IκB involves two IκB kinases, IKKα and IKKβ. In the present study, we investigated the kinetic mechanisms of IKKα and IKKβ by substrate and product inhibition. For both IKKα and IKKβ, the product ADP was a competitive inhibitor versus ATP and a non-competitive inhibitor versus IκBα. An alternative peptide substrate, IκBα-(21–41), was a competitive inhibitorversus IκBα and a non-competitive inhibitorversus ATP for both kinases. These results rigorously eliminate the possibility of an ordered sequential mechanism and demonstrate that both kinases have a random sequential bi bi mechanism. Two natural compounds, quercetin and staurosporine, had previously been shown to inhibit the NF-κB pathway, but the molecular target(s) of these compounds in the event had not been established. Here we demonstrate that quercetin and staurosporine potently inhibit both IKKα and IKKβ. Daidzein, a quercetin analogue that does not inhibit NF-κB activation, showed no significant inhibition of either enzyme. This suggests that the inhibitory properties of quercetin and staurosporine in the NF-κB pathway are mediated in part by their inhibition of IKKα and IKKβ. Mechanism studies reveal that staurosporine is a competitive inhibitor versus ATP, whereas quercetin serves as a mixed type inhibitor versusATP. The strong inhibition of IKKβ by staurosporine (K i = 172 nm) and ADP (K i = 136 nm) provides a rationale and structural framework for designing potent ATP-site inhibitors of IKKβ, which is an attractive drug target for inflammatory diseases.

Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1996; 14: 649-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (5578) Google Scholar). In resting cells, NF-κB is sequestered in the cytoplasm through its association with inhibitory proteins termed IκB. When cells are stimulated by TNFα or interleukin-1, IκB proteins (IκBα and IκBβ) are rapidly phosphorylated at Ser residues in the N-terminal region (2Traenckner E.B. Pahl H.L. Henkel T. Schmidt K.N.

Biol. 1996; 16: 1295-1304Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Phosphorylated IκBα and IκBβ are subsequently ubiquitinated and undergo ubiquitin-dependent degradation by the 26 S proteasome (3DiDonato J.

Maniatis T. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1586-1597Crossref PubMed Scopus (1170) Google Scholar). Degradation of IκB results in the release of NF-κB which then translocates to the nucleus where it up-regulates the transcription of target genes (1Baldwin A.S. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1996; 14: 649-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (5578) Google Scholar). IκBα and IκBβ are phosphorylated by a 500–900-kDa IκB kinase (IKK) (5DiDonato J.A. Hayakawa M. Rothwarf D.M. Zandi E. Karin M.

The physiological function of these protein kinases was recently explored by analysis of IKKα-deficient or IKKβ-deficient mice (10Hu Y. Baud V. Delhase M. Zhang P. Deerinck T. Ellisman M. Johnson R.

Delhase M. Zhang P. Deerinck T. Ellisman M. Johnson R. Karin M. Science. 1999; 284: 316-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (714) Google Scholar, 12Takeda K. Takeuchi O. Tsujimura T. Itami S. Adachi O. Kawai T. Sanjo H. Yoshikawa K. Terada N. Akira S. Science. 1999; 9: 313-316Crossref Scopus (539) Google Scholar). These results show that IKKβ, not IKKα, is the target for pro-inflammatory stimuli. On the other hand, IKKα is essential for development of skin and skeleton during embryogenesis (10Hu Y. Baud V. Delhase M. Zhang P. Deerinck T. Ellisman M. Johnson R. Karin M.

Since IKKα and IKKβ have distinct functions, it is informative to compare the kinetic mechanisms of both kinases. Inhibitors with selectivity between these two kinases would help to elucidate further their different functions in cells and in animal models. IKKα and IKKβ share ∼50% overall homology, and both contain a conserved N-terminal Ser/Thr kinase domain, a leucine-zipper region, and a C-terminal helix-loop-helix (HLH) motif (6Mercurio F. Zhu H.

Science. 1997; 278: 866-869Crossref PubMed Scopus (1068) Google Scholar). Such folding is unique among the known kinases. It has been shown that the HLH domain of IKKβ is required for its kinase activity and the HLH domain can activate the truncated IKKβ (HLH deletion) mutant in trans(16Delhase M. Hayakawa M. Chen Y. Karin M. Science. 1999; 9: 309-313Crossref Scopus (752) Google Scholar). This suggests a functional interaction between the HLH domain and the kinase domain of IKKβ. IKKα and IKKβ also share a distinguishing feature in that they have a strong preference for Serversus Thr on the substrates (5DiDonato J.A. Hayakawa M. Rothwarf D.M. Zandi E. Karin M. Nature. 1997; 388: 548-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (1913) Google Scholar, 6Mercurio F. Zhu H. Murray B.W. Shevchenko A. Bennett B.L. Li J.W. Young D.B. Barbosa M. Mann M. Manning A. Rao A. Science. 1997; 278: 860-865Crossref PubMed Scopus (1853) Google Scholar). It is important to understand the kinetic mechanisms of these two unique members of the Ser/Thr kinase family. Several naturally existing kinase inhibitors have been reported to inhibit the NF-κB pathway. Quercetin, a flavonoid that occurs in many fruits and vegetables (17Seshadri T.R. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1951; 20: 487-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), is a nonspecific inhibitor of protein kinases (18Groundwater P.W. Solomons K.R. Drewe J.A. Munawar M.A. Prog. Med. Chem. 1996; 33: 233-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) and suppresses TNF-induced NF-κB activation (19Natarajan K. Manna S.K. Chaturvedi M.M. Aggarwal B.B. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1998; 352: 59-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The inhibitor blocks the degradation of IκBα and the consequent translocation of the NF-κB p65 subunit (19Natarajan K. Manna S.K. Chaturvedi M.M. Aggarwal B.B. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1998; 352: 59-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Staurosporine, a microbial alkaloid that was isolated from Streptomyces staurosporeus (20Omura S. Iwai Y. Hirano A. Nakagawa A. Awaya J. Tsuchya H. Takahashi Y. Masuma R. J. Antibiot. (Tokyo). 1977; 30: 275-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (616) Google Scholar), has shown potent inhibition of both tyrosine and Ser/Thr kinases (18Groundwater P.W. Solomons K.R. Drewe J.A.

Sci. 1989; 10: 218-220Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (841) Google Scholar). In THP-1 monocytic cells, staurosporine inhibits LPS-dependent NF-κB activation, suggesting that staurosporine-sensitive kinase(s) are involved in LPS-mediated NF-κB activation (22Ishikawa Y. Mukaida N. Kuno K. Rice N. Okamoto S. Matsushima K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4158-4164Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). The inhibitory effects of quercetin and staurosporine in the NF-κB pathway are consistent with their anti-inflammatory responses as observed in various animal models including experimental arthritis and experimental colitis (23Sanchez de Medina F. Galvez J. Romero J.A. Zarzuelo A. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1996; 278: 771-779PubMed Google Scholar, 24Romero J. Marak Jr, G.E. Rao N.A.

However, the molecular target(s) of staurosporine and quercetin in the NF-κB signaling cascade have not been identified. Since IKK is essential for activation of NF-κB by both TNFα and LPS (6Mercurio F. Zhu H. Murray B.W. Shevchenko A. Bennett B.L. Li J.W. Young D.B. Barbosa M. Mann M. Manning A. Rao A.

It was recently shown that high concentrations of the anti-inflammatory agent aspirin inhibits IKKβ (IC50 = ∼50 μm) (28Yin M. Yamamoto Y. Gaynor R.B. Nature. 1998; 396: 77-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (1434) Google Scholar), consistent with its inhibitory effect on the NF-κB pathway (29Kopp E. Ghosh S. Science. 1994; 265: 956-959Crossref PubMed Scopus (1617) Google Scholar). Previously, we have demonstrated that purified recombinant IKKα and IKKβ are direct kinases of IκBα and function independentlyin vitro (30Li J. Peet G.W. Pullen S.S. Schembri-King J. Warren T.C. Marcu K.B. Kehry M.R. Barton R. Jakes S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30736-30741Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). We have also shown that both IKKα and IKKβ display a sequential bi bi mechanism (30Li J. Peet G.W. Pullen S.S. Schembri-King J. Warren T.C. Marcu K.B. Kehry M.R. Barton R. Jakes S. J. Biol.

However, our previous report did not discriminate between the possibilities of a random sequential or an ordered sequential mechanism. In the current study, we perform product and substrate inhibition experiments that demonstrate that both IKKα and IKKβ proceed by a random sequential mechanism. We also demonstrate that the natural compounds quercetin and staurosporine inhibit both IKKα and IKKβ with compound-specific mechanisms. Thus, the inhibitory effects of quercetin and staurosporine on the NF-κB pathway are at least partially through their inhibitions of IKKα and IKKβ. IKKα and IKKβ were expressed as N-terminal FLAG-tagged fusion proteins in baculovirus. The recombinant FLAG-tagged IKKα and IKKβ were purified to apparent homogeneity by affinity chromatography using M2 anti-FLAG affinity gel (Sigma). The procedures for expression and purification have been described previously (30Li J. Peet G.W. Pullen S.S. Schembri-King J. Warren T.C. Marcu K.B. Kehry M.R. Barton R. Jakes S. J. Biol.

IκBα was expressed as a His6-tagged thioredoxin fusion protein (TRX-IκBα-(1–54)) in Escherichia coli and purified by a Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid affinity column, as described (30Li J. Peet G.W. Pullen S.S. Schembri-King J. Warren T.C. Marcu K.B. Kehry M.R. Barton R. Jakes S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30736-30741Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The kinase assays were performed in a plate assay format as described previously (30Li J. Peet G.W. Pullen S.S. Schembri-King J. Warren T.C. Marcu K.B. Kehry M.R. Barton R. Jakes S. J. Biol.

Briefly, reactions (55 μl) were performed at 23 °C in 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 2 mm MnCl2, 100 mm NaCl, 100 μm Na3VO4, 20 mmβ-glycerophosphate, and 1 mm dithiothreitol. The amount of substrates ATP, [γ-33P]ATP (2000 Ci/mmol, NEN Life Science Products) and IκBα are specified for each individual experiment. Samples were analyzed by trichloroacetic acid precipitation on a microtiter plate (Millipore), followed by liquid scintillation counting (30Li J. Peet G.W. Pullen S.S. Schembri-King J. Warren T.C.

Assay conditions were controlled so that the degree of phosphorylation of IκBα was linear with time and concentration of enzyme. The counts represent initial velocity of IKK-catalyzed phosphorylation (<10% of total ATP conversion). All experiments were performed in duplicate. Initial velocity studies were performed with varying concentrations of IκBα at a constant ATP concentration and several fixed inhibitor concentrations. Conversely, initial velocity studies were performed with varying ATP concentrations at a constant IκBα concentration and several fixed inhibitor concentrations. All enzyme activity data are reported as the average of duplicate determinations. The initial rate v was recorded as femtomoles of phosphate transferred to IκBα during the reaction period. Lineweaver-Burk double-reciprocal plots were generated by linear least square fits of the data. Data from inhibition experiments were fitted to either a linear competitive model (Equation 1) or a non-competitive (or mixed inhibition) model (Equation 2) (31Cleland W.W.

The peptide IκBα-(21–41) was ordered from Ana Spec Inc. (San Jose, CA). Various models of kinetic mechanisms have been described for enzymes that catalyze two substrates (34Copeland R.A. Enzymes. VCH Publishers, Inc., New York1996: 263-272Google Scholar, 35Segel I.H. Enzyme Kinetics. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1975: 309-329Google Scholar). For IKKα and IKKβ, our previous study had eliminated a ping-pong mechanism and demonstrated that both enzymes followed a sequential bi bi mechanism (30Li J. Peet G.W. Pullen S.S. Schembri-King J.

Scheme I describes the three possible sequential mechanisms: ordered sequential mechanism with ATP binding first (Model 1), ordered sequential mechanism with IκBα binding first (Model 2), and a random sequential mechanism (Model 3). Validations of these mechanisms are described below. First, the kinase activities of IKKα and IKKβ were determined as a function of varying concentrations of ATP at various fixed concentrations of ADP. The Lineweaver-Burk plots of the data for both IKKα and IKKβ followed Michaelis-Menten kinetics (Fig.1 A and2 A). For both IKKα and IKKβ, a series of double-reciprocal straight line plots intersected on the ordinate, indicating a competitive inhibition mechanism (32Segel I.H. Enzyme Kinetics. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1975: 107-109Google Scholar). Furthermore, the data were plotted as the slope of the reciprocal plotversus the concentration of the inhibitor. The replots for both IKKα and IKKβ are linear (Figs. 1 A and2 A, insets), and yieldedK is values of 156 and 147 nm for IKKα and IKKβ, respectively.Figure 2The kinetics of inhibition of IKKβ by ADP. A,double-reciprocal plots of 1/v versus 1/[ATP] were generated at 6 fixed ADP concentrations of 0 nm(open circles), 25 nm (open triangles), 50 nm (open squares), 125 nm (closed circles), 250 nm(closed triangles), and 1000 nm (closed diamonds). Reactions were performed at 23 °C for 15 min with 25 ng of IKKβ, 7 μm IκBα, 292 nCi of [γ-33P]ATP, and varying concentrations of ATP as indicated.

Reactions were performed at 23 °C for 15 min with 25 ng of IKKβ, 342 nCi of [γ-33P]ATP, 200 nm ATP, and varying concentrations of IκBα as indicated. Insets, the slopes of the plots in A and B were replottedversus [ADP].View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We subsequently investigated the inhibition mechanism of ADP toward the substrate IκBα. The kinase activities of IKKα and IKKβ were determined as a function of varying concentrations of IκBα at various fixed concentrations of ADP. The Lineweaver-Burk plots of the data for both IKKα and IKKβ yielded a series of straight lines that crossed on the abscissa, to the left side of the ordinate (Figs.1 B and 2 B), indicating a non-competitive inhibition mechanism (32Segel I.H. Enzyme Kinetics. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1975: 107-109Google Scholar). As can be seen, the product ADP is a competitive inhibitor of IKKα and IKKβ with respect to ATP and a non-competitive inhibitor with respect to IκBα. This behavior is incompatible with an ordered sequential mechanism with IκBα binding first (Scheme I, Model 2), since otherwise ADP would have been an un-competitive inhibitor with respect to IκBα. However, the results do not exclude a random sequential mechanism or an ordered sequential mechanism with ATP binding first (Scheme I, Model 1 or 3). The peptide corresponding to amino acids 21–41 of IκBα would compete with IκBα for binding to the enzymes, since the peptide can be phosphorylated by both IKKα and IKKβ (6Mercurio F. Zhu H.

Thus, this peptide is an alternative substrate for IKKα and IKKβ with respect to IκBα. Since the 21-amino acid peptide is not retained during trichloroacetic acid precipitation and membrane filtration in the phosphorylation assay (data not shown), the assay only monitors the appearance of the radioactive 33P on recombinant protein Trx-IκBα. Therefore, we are able to use this peptide as an alternative substrate inhibitor to study the kinetic mechanisms of IKKα and IKKβ. In an effort to further elucidate the sequential mechanism (Scheme I, Model 1 or Model 3), we inhibited the phosphorylation of IκBα with this peptide using approaches similar to that employed for the ADP inhibition studies as described above. As shown in Figs.3 A and4 A, double-reciprocal plots of 1/v versus 1/[IκBα] at various fixed peptide concentrations yielded straight lines that crossed on the ordinate, confirming its being a competitive inhibitor toward the substrate IκBα for both IKKα and IKKβ. The apparentK is values of 139 and 90 μm for IKKα and IKKβ, respectively, were obtained from linear secondary plots (Figs. 3 A and 4 A, insets).Figure 4Inhibition of IKKβ by peptide IκBα-(21–41). A, double-reciprocal plots of 1/v versus 1/[IκBα] were generated at 5 fixed peptide concentrations of 0 μm (closed circles), 62.5 μm (open circles), 125 μm(closed triangles), 250 μm (open triangles), and 500 μm (closed squares). Reactions were performed at 23 °C for 15 min with 25 ng of IKKβ, 546 nCi of [γ-33P]ATP, 200 nm ATP, and varying concentrations of IκBα as indicated.

The Lineweaver-Burk plots of the data for both IKKα and IKKβ yielded a series of straight lines that intersected on the abscissa, to the left side of the ordinate, indicating a non-competitive inhibition mechanism (Figs.3 B and 4 B). The different patterns of product inhibition and substrate inhibition for bi bi sequential reactions have been derived (34Copeland R.A. Enzymes. VCH Publishers, Inc., New York1996: 263-272Google Scholar, 35Segel I.H. Enzyme Kinetics. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1975: 309-329Google Scholar). The inhibition patterns obtained for IKKα and IKKβ in this study are summarized in Table I. The fact that the product ADP was a competitive inhibitor versus ATP but a non-competitive inhibitor versus IκBα indicates either a random sequential mechanism (Scheme I, Model 3) or an ordered sequential mechanism with ATP binding first (Scheme I,Model 1). The peptide IκBα-(21–41) behaves as a competitive inhibitor versus IκBα but as a non-competitive inhibitor versus ATP. This eliminates the possibility of an ordered sequential mechanism with ATP binding first (Scheme I, Model 1), which would give an un-competitive inhibition pattern with respect to ATP. In conclusion, the kinetics of IKKα and IKKβ follow a random-ordered sequential bi bi mechanism (Scheme I, Model 3).Table IKinetic parameters of IKKα and IKKβ from data presented in Figs.Figure 1, Figure 2, Figure 3, Figure 4EnzymeFig.InhibitorVaried substrateInhibition patternK isK iiK iβ μmIKKα1AADPATPC0.1561BADPIκBαNC0.4200.2810.1250.73AIκBα(21–41)IκBαC1393BIκBα(21–41)ATPNC1741741361.0IKKβ2AADPATPC0.1472BADPIκBαNC0.3460.3510.1361.04AIκBα(21–41)IκBαC904BIκBα(21–41)ATPNC172180291.0The abbreviations used are: C, competitive; NC, noncompetitive.

In the two examples found so far, human RNase 2 and interleukin-12, only the first Trp in the recognition motif WXXW is specificallyC-mannosylated. To establish the generality of proteinC-mannosylation, and to learn more about its mechanism, the terminal components of the human complement system (C6, C7, C8,and C9), which contain multiple and complex recognition motifs, were examined. Together with C5b they form the cytolytic agent, the membrane attack complex. These are the first proteins that areC-mannosylated on more than one Trp residue as follows: six in C6, four in C7, C8α, and C8β, and two in C9. Thus, from the 113 Trp residues in the complete membrane attack complex, 50 were found to undergo C-mannosylation. The other important finding is that in C6, C7, C8, and C9 Trp residues without a second Trp (or another aromatic residue) at the +3 position can beC-mannosylated. This shows that they must contain an additional C-mannosylation signal. Whether this is encoded in the primary or tertiary structure is presently unknown. Finally, all modified Trp residues are part of the highly conserved core of the thrombospondin type 1 repeats present in these proteins.

In particular proteins that contain N- orO-linked oligosaccharides have been known for a relatively long time (3Gottschalk A. Gottschalk A. Glycoproteins. Elsevier Publishing Company, Amsterdam1966: 1-19Google Scholar, 4Gottschalk A. Gottschalk A. Glycoproteins.

Recently, a new type of glycosylation has been discovered in human RNase 2, which differs fundamentally from N- and O-glycosylation with respect to the protein carbohydrate linkage. It involves theC-glycosidic attachment of an α-mannopyranosyl residue to the C-2 atom of the tryptophan side chain (5Hofsteenge J. Müller D.R. de Beer T. Löffler A. Richter W.J. Vliegenthart J.F.G.

This modification has been shown to be catalyzed by a microsome-associated transferase, whichC-mannosylates the first Trp residue in the recognition sequence -WXXW- (8Doucey M.-A. Hess D. Cacan R. Hofsteenge J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 291-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 9Krieg J. Hartmann S. Vicentini A. Gläsner W. Hess D. Hofsteenge J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 301-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). The enzyme uses dolichylphosphate mannose as the sugar donor, and its activity has been found in mammals, birds, amphibians, and fish. Furthermore, it could also be detected in most mouse organs that were examined (10Krieg J. Gläsner W. Vincentini A. Doucey M.-A. Löffler A. Hess D. Hofsteenge J. J. Biol.

In addition to the widespread distribution of the C-mannosyltransferase, its recognition motif, WXXW, has been found in over 300 secreted mammalian proteins (9Krieg J. Hartmann S. Vicentini A. Gläsner W. Hess D. Hofsteenge J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 301-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). This strongly suggests thatC- mannosylation is a more common form of glycosylation than indicated by the fact that only two C-mannosylated proteins have been characterized so far, i.e. human RNase 2 (5Hofsteenge J. Müller D.R. de Beer T. Löffler A. Richter W.J. Vliegenthart J.F.G. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 13524-13530Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar, 6de Beer T. Vliegenthart J.F.G. Löffler A.

Glycobiology. 1999; 9: 435-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). These two proteins contain a single C-mannosylation motif of the simple structure WXXW. To further our insight into the process of protein C-mannosylation, we examine here proteins that contain multiple and more complex C-mannosylation motifs. The terminal complement proteins C6, C7, C8, and C9 are attractive candidates for studying protein C-mannosylation because of the following: (i) they contain complex C-mannosylation motifs (WXXWXXW) as part of their thrombospondin type 1 repeats (TSR modules); (ii) they possess up to three TSR modules; and (iii) they have a clearly defined physiological function (see below). The latter is important, since so far a function forC-mannosylation of Trp residues has not been established. The complement, which forms a first line of defense against microbial infections, can be activated by three different pathways as follows: the alternative, the classical, and the mannose-binding lectin-mediated pathway (13Müller-Eberhard H.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1988; 57: 321-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (705) Google Scholar, 14Turner M.W. Immunol. Today. 1996; 17: 532-540Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (685) Google Scholar).

Immunol. 1986; 4: 503-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar). The assembly of MAC begins with the formation of C5b by C5 convertase at the target membrane, followed by the sequential addition of the plasma proteins C6, C7, C8, and C9 (see Reaction 1). C5b-9 n forms a trans-membrane channel, whose exact size can vary, depending on the value of n. The association process has been examined in detail both on natural as well as artificial membranes (16Tschopp J. Müller-Eberhard H.J. Podack E.R. Nature. 1982; 298: 534-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 17Tschopp J. Engel A. Podack E.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 1922-1928Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Tschopp J.

The value of n for the complete MAC ranges from 12 to 18 with an average of approximately 16 (see Ref. 19Silversmith R.E. Nelsestuen G.L. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 852-860Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar for a discussion), which yields a calculated mass of 1.4 × 106 Da. Here we have examined the C-mannosylation of Trp residues in the TSR modules of C6, C7, C8α, C8β, and C9 by analyzing peptides by ESIMS, Edman degradation, and NMR. It was found thatC-mannosylation can occur at 50 out of 113 Trp residues in the MAC and that also Trp residues without a second Trp at position +3 can undergo this modification. Human complement component C6 was purchased from Sigma, and components C7, C8, and C9 were from Advanced Research Technologies, San Diego, CA. Component C9 used in the protein chemical analyses was a generous gift of Dr. J. Tschopp, University of Lausanne, Switzerland. Proteins were reduced and carboxamidomethylated as described previously (20Hofsteenge J. Servis C. Stone S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 24198-24204Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Tryptic digestion of the proteins was performed twice in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, for 2 h at 37 °C at an enzyme to substrate ratio of 1/50 (C7 and C8) or 1/100 (C6 and C9). Subsequently, C7 and C8 were digested for 4 h with endoproteinase Asp-N (1/50; Roche Molecular Biochemicals) at 37 °C. The amount of protein per digest was 50–75 μg for C6, C7, and C8, and two digests were made. The total amount of C9 digested was 7 mg. Cleavage of isolated peptides with 200 ng of chymotrypsin was performed for 2 h at 37 °C. Digests were fractionated by C8 reversed phase LC-ESIMS as described (10Krieg J. Gläsner W. Vincentini A.

If necessary final purification was achieved by LC-ESIMS, using 25 mm NH4 acetate, pH 6.0, containing 2 or 80% CH3CN, as buffers A and B, respectively. Nanospray ESIMSMS and solid-phase Edman degradation were performed according to published methods (21Wilm M. Shevchenko A. Houthaeve T. Breit S. Schweigerer L. Fotsis T. Mann M.

NMR spectra were measured on a Varian Unity Plus spectrometer operating at a 1H frequency of 600 MHz. Susceptibility matched NMR tubes (Shygemi) with sample volumes of 220 μl were used. Clean TOCSY spectra were recorded with a mixing time of 40 and 80 ms. The spectra were folded once int 1 to increase the resolution. The spectra were recorded with 192 increments and 160 transients. Experiments of samples in 90% H2O, 10% D2O were recorded using the Watergate method. Spectra were referenced against acetone (δ = 2.225 ppm (23Vliegenthart J.F.G. Dorland L. van Halbeek H. Adv.

Peptides that resulted from tryptic digestion have been labeled with the prefix “T,” whereas subsequent digestion with endoproteinase Asp-N and chymotrypsin have been indicated with the affix “D” and “Ch,” respectively. The peptide Ac-WAKW-NH2, the C6-derived peptide Ac-LLGDFGPWSDCD-NH2, and the C9-derived peptide Ac-RMSPWSEWSQCD-NH2 were C-mannosylated in vitro using salt-washed porcine liver microsomes as the source of transferase (12Doucey M.-A. Hess D. Blommers M.J. Hofsteenge J. Glycobiology. 1999; 9: 435-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). The reaction mixture contained in a total volume of 24 μl the following: 0.9 mm peptide, 22.5 pmol of Dol-P-[2-3H]Man (5.6 Ci/mmol), porcine liver microsomes (77 μg of protein), 20 mm Hepes-NaOH, pH 7.2, 0.2% (w/v) Triton X-100, 2 μg/ml benzamidine, 5 μg/ml pepstatin, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 mm EGTA. The reaction was performed for 30 min at 37 °C and stopped by the addition of 2 ml chloroform/methanol 3:2 (v/v) and 0.48 ml of water. After centrifugation the upper, aqueous, phase contained the peptide. The radioactivity in 0.2 ml of the upper phase was determined by scintillation counting (8Doucey M.-A. Hess D. Cacan R. Hofsteenge J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 291-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). For preparative purposes, 10 reactions were performed for 42 h at room temperature (12Doucey M.-A. Hess D. Blommers M.J. Hofsteenge J. Glycobiology. 1999; 9: 435-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). The radiolabeled peptide was reduced, carboxamidomethylated, and isolated by C18 reversed phase HPLC as described (5Hofsteenge J. Müller D.R. de Beer T. Löffler A. Richter W.J. Vliegenthart J.F.G. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 13524-13530Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). Final purification was achieved after tryptic cleavage and fractionation by C8 reversed phase LC-MS (12Doucey M.-A. Hess D. Blommers M.J. Hofsteenge J. Glycobiology. 1999; 9: 435-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). The fractionation of the tryptic peptides from carboxamidomethylated C9 by reversed phase LC-ESIMS is shown in Fig.1 A. The MS data were extracted for the theoretical mass of the peptide(s) containing aC-mannosylation motif, with or without the mass of a hexosyl residue (162 Da) added. Two forms of peptide T2, comprising residues 24–38 of the mature protein (for nomenclature of peptides and numbering system see “Experimental Procedures”), were detected. Peptide T2–1, eluting at 41.1 min, had a molecular mass of 2101 Da (Fig. 1B, upper panel), which was 162 Da heavier than expected from the cDNA sequence (28DiScipio R.G. Gehring M.R. Podack E.R.

ESIMSMS of this fraction yielded a nearly complete series of y ions, confirming its sequence and localizing the hexosyl residue to Trp-27 (Fig.2 A and TableI).

To confirm the identity of the mannosyl residue, the peptide was analyzed by NMR spectroscopy. The region of the spectrum that is just upfield from the water resonance is expected to be empty for a random coil 15-mer peptide. It would only show signals of upfield shifted Hα resonances in case the peptide would obtain stable turns or a β-sheet structure. However, the amide resonances exchange very fast with D2O, and the observed J HNHαcouplings are all around the random coil value of 6–7 Hz, indicating that the peptide was not structured (data not shown). This allows the unequivocal identification of anomeric sugar protons, which resonate in this region. The anomeric part of the spectrum of the pentadecapeptide T2–1 is shown in Fig. 3 B and is compared with that of the C-mannosylated peptide isolated from IL-12 (Fig. 3 A (12Doucey M.-A. Hess D. Blommers M.J. Hofsteenge J. Glycobiology. 1999; 9: 435-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar)). It is evident from this comparison that the doublet signal that resonates at 5.18 ppm and that was split by a J coupling of 7.4 Hz is the anomeric H1′ resonance of (C2-Man-)Trp. This interpretation was confirmed by the disappearance of one of the H2 resonances of Trp and by the assignments of the other resonances of the sugar moiety and of the Trp residue with the help of TOCSY experiments (TableII). An additional doublet signal at 5.27 ppm which was split by a J coupling of 6.5 Hz was observed. This signal has an intensity of only 15%. Minor components of the same magnitude were also observed for the aromatic protons of (C2-Man-)Trp. We therefore concluded that the extra anomeric resonances were caused by thecis-trans-isomerization of the peptide bond between Ser and Pro preceding the mannosylated Trp (32Gratwohl C. Wüthrich K. Biopolymers. 1976; 15: 2025-2041Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar), rather than by a heterogeneity in the sugar moiety.Table IIChemical shifts of the C2-mannosylated Trp residues at 300 K in component C9, IL-12 (12Doucey M.-A.

Open table in a new tab The notation of the atoms is as depicted in Scheme 1. The identification of a second form of peptide T2 (T2–2 in Fig.1 A) was surprising, since its mass (2263 Da, Fig.1 B) indicated the presence of two hexosyl residues. However, the peptide only contained a single, simple C-mannosylation motif (-WSEW-). Its MS spectrum did not show the conspicuous loss of 162 Da which would indicate the presence of an O-linked hexose (Fig. 1 B). In agreement with this, ESIMSMS demonstrated unequivocally that in this peptide Trp-27 and -30 were both C-hexosylated (Fig. 2 B and Table I). The PTH-derivatives observed at cycles 4 and 7 during Edman degradation of this peptide comigrated exactly with each other and with PTH-(C2-Man-)Trp from RNase 2 (Fig. 1 D). The anomeric part of the 1H NMR spectrum of peptide T2–2 is shown in Fig. 3 C. Interestingly, in comparison with sample T2–1, an additional doublet resonance was observed. The resonances at 5.20 and 5.18 ppm were split by J-couplings of 7.1 and 7.4 Hz, respectively. Fig. 3 D shows part of the TOCSY spectrum, recorded with a mixing time of 80 ms. It is evident from this spectrum that these anomeric resonances are part of similar spin systems with approximately the same chemical shifts (Table II). In fact the TOCSY spectra are similar to those recorded of the peptides with only one glycosylated Trp. In the case of peptide T2–2 two indole H2 resonances were missing. Thus, it is concluded that in this particular case both Trp residues in the WXXW motif wereC 2-mannosylated. The signal at 5.27 ppm with an intensity of about 15%, caused by thecis-trans-isomerization of the Ser-Pro bond appeared in this spectrum as well. Examination of the LC-ESIMS data did not reveal the presence of unmodified peptide T2. Furthermore, the other two Trp residues in component C9, at positions 176 and 436, were observed in the unmodified form only. Component C8 is a heterotrimeric protein consisting of a disulfide-linked α-γ dimer and a non-covalently associated β subunit. Both the α and β subunit contain two TSR modules. To obtain peptides suitable for MS and sequence analysis, carboxamidomethylated C8 was digested first with trypsin and subsequently with endoproteinase Asp-N. Fractionation by reversed phase LC-ESIMS yielded two C-glycosylated peptides originating from the α-subunit, αT1-D (2155 Da; residues 1–26 with one hexosyl residue) and αT57 (2317 Da; residues 508–522 with three hexosyl residues). The fraction containing αT1-D was further cleaved with chymotrypsin, yielding pure αT1-D-Ch (residues 10–18) upon LC-ESIMS purification. Nanospray ESIMSMS of this peptide established that the sugar moiety was attached to Trp-14, whereas Trp-17 occurred in the unmodified form (Table I). The peptide was sequenced by Edman degradation, showing exact comigration of the PTH-derivative at cycle 5 with PTH-(C2-Man-)Trp from RNase 2 (Table I). Peptide αT57 contained three hexosyl residues and was purified to apparent homogeneity by LC-ESIMS at pH 6.0 (data not shown). Its nanospray ESIMSMS spectrum and Edman degradation (Table I) showed unequivocally that Trp-512, -515, and -518 wereC-mannosylated. Consistent with this, no loss of 162 Da was observed in MSMS experiments with either αT1-D-Ch or αT57, which would have been evidence for O-linked hexosyl residues. Since only C-mannosylated forms of αT1-D and αT57 were detected in the chromatogram of the starting digest, it is concluded that these four Trp residues were fully modified. From the C8β chain two peptides, βT1-D (1942 Da, residues 10–22 with two hexosyl residues) and βT59 (2010 Da, residues 494–506 with two hexosyl residues) were detected and purified further by LC-ESIMS at pH 6.0 (data not shown). Both Trp-16 and -19 in βT1-D were modified, as was demonstrated by nano-ESIMSMS, which showed a continuous series of b and y ions covering both Trp residues, as well as 120-Da loss from a number of ions (Table I). These results were confirmed by Edman degradation (Table I). Peptide βT59 still contained a contaminating peptide (YILNTR), even after rechromatography. Its presence did not, however, interfere with further analysis. ESIMSMS localized the hexosyl residues on Trp-497 and -500, and 120-Da losses were observed from the parent as well as the y7 and y9 ions (Table I). Edman degradation confirmed Trp-494 to be unmodified and yielded PTH-(C2-Man-)Trp in cycles 4 and 7 (Table I). With neither of these peptides was any evidence for O-linked hexosyl residues obtained. These results extend the unexpected finding in C9 that Trp residues without a Trp or another aromatic residue at position +3 can beC-mannosylated. Of the two TSR modules in component C7 only the second one contains WXXW motifs. Nevertheless, a tryptic/Asp-N peptide from the first repeat was found that had a mass that was 162 Da larger than expected from the cDNA sequence (T1-D, 1897 Da, residues 9–22). ESIMSMS of this peptide (Fig.4 A) positioned the substituent at Trp-14, and a C-glycosidic linkage was conclud"

We have previously identified an approximately 230-kDa protein present in a nuclear protein complex in normal human lymphoblastoid cells that is involved in repair of DNA interstrand cross-links and shows reduced levels in FA-A cell nuclei. The FANCA gene appears to play a role in the stability or expression of this protein.

These studies also show that αSpIIΣ* forms a complex in the nucleus with the FANCA and FANCC proteins. αSpIIΣ* may thus act as a scaffold to align or enhance interactions between FA proteins and proteins involved in DNA repair.

How the DNA repair defect is related to the FA genes or gene products or to the clinical manifestations of the disorder is unclear. We have isolated a chromatin-associated protein complex from the nuclei of normal human lymphoblastoid cell nuclei and have shown that this complex is involved in the repair of DNA interstrand cross-links (12Lambert M.W.

In FA-A and FA-D cells there is a defect in the ability of this complex to incise DNA containing interstrand cross-links (13Lambert, M. W., Tsongalis, G. J., Lambert, W. C., Hang, B., and Parrish, D.

We have now determined the identity of the 230-kDa protein and shown that it is the structural protein α spectrin II (αSpIIΣ*). We have also shown that levels of αSpIIΣ* are significantly reduced in FA-B, FA-C, and FA-D, as well as FA-A cells and that this protein forms a complex in the nucleus with the FANCA and FANCC proteins. Thus αSpIIΣ* may act as a scaffold to align or enhance interactions between the FA proteins and other proteins in the nucleus such as those involved in DNA repair.

Keck Foundation Biotechnology Resource Laboratory at Yale University for mass spectrometric analysis by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization mass spectrometry (MALDI-MS). At the Keck Facility, the protein was digested within the gel slice with trypsin. The resulting digest was mixed with α-cyano-4-hydroxy cinnamic acid matrix solution and spotted onto a sample target (25Williams K.R. Samandar S.M. Stone K.L. Saylor M. Rush J. Walker J.M. The Protein Protocols Handbook. Humana Press, Totowa, NJ1996: 541-555Crossref Google Scholar). The sample target was then introduced into the mass spectrometer, a Micromass TofSpec S.E. that can be used in either the linear or reflectron mode and is equipped with delayed extraction, which increases resolution and mass accuracy. The resulting peptide masses were then subjected to peptide mass searching using Peptide Search and Profound to identify proteins whose sequences were in the EMBL nonredundant and OWL data bases, respectively. To get a better idea of the relative abundance of the 230-kDa protein in the HeLa cell chromatin-associated protein extracts, these extracts were separated by SDS-PAGE according to the method of Laemmli (26Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206620) Google Scholar). Samples were electrophoresed on two different 15 × 20-cm gels, each with a 4% stacking gel: one using a 7–9.5% gradient (to maximize separation of the higher molecular weight range proteins), and the other using a 12.5–15% gradient (for separation of the lower molecular weight proteins). In addition, human erythroid spectrin (Sigma) was also electrophoresed on the 7–9.5% gradient gel. Two different molecular weight markers were run alongside these lanes: NOVEX See Blue Ladder (4–250-kDa range) and Bio-Rad Kaleidoscope Ladder (7.1–208-kDa range). After electrophoresis, gels were stained with SYPRO orange (1:5,000 dilution) (Bio-Rad) in 10% acetic acid for 45 min to 1.5 h. Gels were visualized on a VISTA FluorimagerSI using ImageQuant software (Molecular Dynamics). For immunoprecipitation (IP), chromatin-associated protein extracts from normal human, HeLa, FA-A, and transduced FA-A cells were prepared in 50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.0, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mmdithiothreitol, and 40% glycerol. For anti-FANCA IP, affinity-purified rabbit polyclonal antisera generated from the carboxyl-terminal region of the FANCA protein, or pre-immune serum, was bound to protein A-coated agarose beads (Sigma) in binding buffer (25 mmTris-Cl, pH 7.3, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100 plus protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Molecular Biochemicals)). For anti-α spectrin IPs, anti-α spectrin (prepared against chicken blood cell membranes, specific for mammalian nonerythroid α spectrin and chicken α spectrin) (Chemicon, mAb 1622), or anti-mouse IgG1 (Sigma) (used as a control) was bound to protein G-coated agarose beads (Sigma) in binding buffer. These beads were blocked in blocking buffer (4% nonfat dried milk blocker (Bio-Rad) in TTBS (25 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.3, 150 mm NaCl, and 0.05% Tween 20)), washed, and resuspended as a 1:3 slurry in binding buffer. Immunoprecipitation was carried out by mixing 30 μl of this slurry with 25 μg of chromatin-associated protein extract and an equal volume of IP buffer (25 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.3, 125 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100 plus protease inhibitor mixture) overnight at 4 °C. Protein concentrations were determined using Bradford reagent (Bio-Rad). The protein A- or G-agarose bead-bound immune complexes were then washed three times with IP buffer and resuspended in this buffer. The IPs and aliquots of chromatin-associated extracts from the cell lines examined were subjected to SDS-PAGE, using 8–16% gradient gels or 10% gels. After electrophoresis, the proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose and immunoblotted. For immunoblotting, chromatin-associated proteins from the nucleus of either normal human lymphoblastoid, HeLa, FA-A, FA-B, FA-C, FA-D, or transduced FA-A cells, or human erythroid spectrin (Sigma) were separated on SDS-PAGE, using either 7.5 × 8.5-cm or 15 × 20-cm gels, following the method of Laemmli (26Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206620) Google Scholar). The proteins were then transferred to nitrocellulose in transfer buffer (25 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.3, 192 mm glycine, and 20% (v/v) methanol) at 100 volts for 2 or 2.5 h at 4 °C. The membranes were blocked in blocking buffer for 1 h at room temperature or overnight at 4 °C and then incubated in primary antibody in TTBS overnight at 4 °C. After washing in TTBS, the blots were incubated in secondary antibody (anti-mouse IgM, anti-mouse IgG, or anti-rabbit IgG) or protein A conjugated to horseradish peroxidase in 1% nonfat dried milk blocker (Bio-Rad) in TTBS. The blots were washed further in TTBS and reacted with substrate (Pierce Ultra or Pierce Super chemiluminescent substrate) and exposed to x-ray film (Pierce). The primary antibodies used were anti-αSpIIΣ*, anti-α spectrin, anti-FANCA (carboxyl-terminal), anti-FANCC (amino-terminal) (generous gift of Dr. Alan D'Andrea, Harvard Medical School), and anti-topoisomerase II (Oncogene). When blots were reprobed, they were stripped of IgM using a high salt buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 500 mm NaCl, and 0.3% Tween 20) and IgG per the manufacturer's instructions (Pierce) and were reblocked before reprobing with primary antibody. Alternatively, blots were incubated with secondary antibody conjugated to alkaline phosphatase in 1% nonfat dried milk blocker (Bio-Rad) in TTBS, washed in TTBS and incubated in 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indoyl phosphate/nitro blue tetrazolium solution (Bio-Rad). Images were scanned using a Hewlett-Packard ScanJet 4c/T scanner and analyzed using ImageQuant (Molecular Dynamics). A mAb developed against the 230-kDa protein has been used in its identification. This protein, after separation by gel electrophoresis and identification by Western blot analysis, was digested with trypsin and analyzed by MALDI-MS. The rationale for using this approach is that it is very sensitive and the mass spectrum of the peptide mixture, resulting from the enzymatic digestion of the protein, provides a fingerprint that can be specific enough to identify the protein (27Cottrell J.S. Sutton C.W. Chapman J.R. Methods in Molecular Biology, Vol. 61: Protein and Peptide Analysis by Mass Spectrometry. Humana Press, Totowa, NJ1996: 67-82Google Scholar). Using this method, the 230-kDa protein was identified as human nonerythroid α spectrin (α spectrin II). The calculated peptide masses obtained from the protein digest were searched against two different data bases to determine the number of matched peptides. A ProFound search of the peptides obtained from the 230-kDa protein digest gave a probability score of 1.0e+00 to human α spectrin II with a clean break between this score and the score of the next nonrelated protein. The percentage coverage of the known sequence for this protein was 35% (i.e. the peptide masses obtained for analysis matched to 35% of the known protein sequence). This exceeded the minimum percentage coverage of 25% set as a criterion for a protein match by the Keck Facility. A second ProFound search was performed, after deleting sequences that matched human α spectrin II, and no additional protein was identified. PeptideSearch matched the same protein with 33% coverage. This analysis of the 230-kDa protein was repeated on a second sample obtained from another HeLa cell chromatin-associated protein extract with the same result. Because the isoform of the α spectrin we have identified is unknown, this protein has been designated αSpIIΣ* in accordance with proposed nomenclature (17Winkelmann J.C. Forget B.G. Blood. 1993; 81: 3173-3185Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 28Ma Y. Zimmer W.E. Riederer B.M. Bloom M.L. Barker J.E. Goodman S.R. Mol. Brain Res. 1993; 18: 87-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Confirmation of the 230-kDa protein as αSpIIΣ* was made by Western blot analysis. A mAb against an α spectrin, with specificity for mammalian nonerythroid α spectrin (Chemicon), bound to the 230-kDa protein from HeLa chromatin-associated protein extracts (Fig.1, lane 1); binding of this mAb to human erythroid spectrin (α and β chains) (Fig. 1,lane 2) was used as a control. Similarly, anti-αSpIIΣ* bound to α spectrin in HeLa cell extracts and to the α and β chains of erythroid spectrin (Fig. 1, lane 4). Both anti-α spectrin and anti-αSpIIΣ* showed cross-reactivity with α and β spectrin. Using these antibodies, β spectrin was not detected in the HeLa cell chromatin-associated protein extracts. Confirmation that both mAbs were binding to the same protein band was made by analysis of the respective immunoblots lined up with gold-stained proteins from a section of the same membrane (data not shown). Further confirmation of the location of β spectrin on these gels was obtained by Western blot analysis using a mAb that principally recognized erythroid β spectrin (data not shown). Electrophoretic separation of the proteins in the HeLa cell chromatin-associated protein extracts showed that αSpIIΣ* is not one of the major bands present in these protein extracts (Fig.2, A, lane 1 andB). The αSpIIΣ* band (Fig. 2 A, lane 1) lined up exactly with the α spectrin band from erythroid spectrin (Fig. 2 A, lane 2), which was run alongside it on the same gel. The identity of these bands was verified by Western blot analysis. Both proteins, according to electrophoretic mobility, had an apparent molecular mass of approximately 230 kDa, which agrees with previously reported values (230–240 kDa) (18Goodman S.R. Zimmer W.E. Clark M.B. Zagon J.S. Barber J.E. Bloom M.L. Brain. Res. Bull. 1995; 36: 593-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 29Saido T.C. Yokota M. Nagao S. Yamamura I. Tam E. Tsuchiya T. Suzuki K. Kawashima S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25239-25343Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and is lower than the calculated molecular mass of 284 kDa for nonerythroid and 280 kDa for erythroid α spectrin (18Goodman S.R. Zimmer W.E. Clark M.B. Zagon J.S. Barber J.E. Bloom M.L. Brain. Res. Bull. 1995; 36: 593-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 30Moon R.T. McMahon A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 4427-4433Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Immunoblotting showed that there are reduced levels of the 230-kDa protein in chromatin-associated protein extracts from FA complementation group B (FA-B), C (FA-C), and D (FA-D) cells (Fig.3, top panel, lanes 3–5) compared with normal extracts (Fig. 3, top panel,lane 1) just as there are in the FA-A extracts (Fig. 3,top panel, lane 2). Thus in at least four FA complementation groups there is a deficiency in αSpIIΣ*. In these studies topoisomerase II was used as an internal control (Fig. 3,bottom panel). Levels of αSpIIΣ* are restored to normal in FA-A cells that have been corrected with FANCA cDNA (Fig.4, top panel, lanes 1–3), as previously shown (16Brois D.W. McMahon L.W. Ramos N.I. Anglin A.M. Walsh C.E. Lambert M.W. Carcinogenesis. 1999; 20: 1845-1853Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), indicating that theFANCA gene plays a role in the stability or expression of this protein. Similar results were obtained when immunoblotting was carried out using anti-α spectrin (Chemicon). Reduced binding of anti-α spectrin to αSpIIΣ* in FA-A extracts was restored to normal in corrected FA-A cells (Fig. 4, second panel,lanes 1–3). Topoisomerase II was used as an internal control. To determine whether αSpIIΣ* interacts with the FANCA and FANCC proteins, immunoprecipitation studies were carried out. Anti-FANCA immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting with either anti-αSpIIΣ* or anti-α spectrin demonstrated that αSpIIΣ* co-immunoprecipitated with FANCA and FANCC from HeLa chromatin-associated protein extracts (Fig. 5, lane 1). Preliminary studies indicate that FANCG also immunoprecipitated with FANCA and FANCC. None of these proteins co-immunoprecipitated from FA-A extracts, which lack FANCA and are deficient in αSpIIΣ* (Fig. 5, lane 2). In extracts from corrected FA-A cells, αSpIIΣ* again co-immunoprecipitated with FANCA and FANCC (Fig. 5, lane 3) and also FANCG (preliminary data). These results thus show that αSpIIΣ* forms a nuclear complex with these proteins. Faint bands were detected in the pre-immune precipitations (Fig. 5, lane 4) indicating a slight reactivity of the pre-immune sera with spectrin. The binding of FANCA and FANCC to αSpIIΣ* was confirmed by anti-α spectrin immunoprecipitation (Fig.6 A, lane 1). Anti-α spectrin was used, even though it may be against a different isoform than our αSpIIΣ*, because our anti-αSpIIΣ* is of the IgM class and cannot be used effectively in immunoprecipitations. In FA-A extracts, no FANCA and reduced amounts of αSpIIΣ* and FANCC immunoprecipitated (Fig. 6 A, lane 2). This corresponds to no expressed FANCA (Fig. 6 B, lane 2) and reduced levels of αSpIIΣ* (Fig. 4, top panel, lane 2) and FANCC (Fig. 6 B,lane 2) in FA-A nuclei. Reduced levels of FANCC in FA-A cell nuclei have also been reported by Yamashita et al. (36Yamashita T. Kupfer G.M. Vaf D. Suliman A. Joenje H. Asano S. D'Andrea A.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13085-13090Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). In extracts from corrected FA-A cells, αSpIIΣ*, FANCA, and FANCC again co-immunoprecipitated (Fig. 6 A, lane 3). These studies confirm that FANCA and FANCC form a complex with αSpIIΣ* in the nucleus and that normal levels of αSpIIΣ* and FANCA in the nucleus are important for complex formation. αSpIIΣ* has now been identified as associated with a protein complex that we have isolated from normal human cells and shown to be involved in repair of DNA interstrand cross-links (12Lambert M.W. Fenkart D. Clarke M. Mutat. Res. 1988; 193: 65-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 13Lambert, M. W., Tsongalis, G. J., Lambert, W. C., Hang, B., and Parrish, D. D. Mutat.

The exact isoform of this protein is not yet know and is currently being examined. Isoforms of each spectrin gene, generated by alternative pre-mRNA splicing, have been shown to occur (17Winkelmann J.C. Forget B.G. Blood. 1993; 81: 3173-3185Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Goodman S.R. Zimmer W.E. Clark M.B. Zagon J.S. Barber J.E. Bloom M.L. Brain. Res. Bull. 1995; 36: 593-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 30Moon R.T. McMahon A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 4427-4433Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The presence of different isoforms in different cells and even in the same cell suggests distinct functions for each (18Goodman S.R. Zimmer W.E. Clark M.B. Zagon J.S. Barber J.E. Bloom M.L. Brain. Res. Bull. 1995; 36: 593-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 30Moon R.T. McMahon A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 4427-4433Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 31Bloch R.J. Morrow J.S. J. Cell. Biol. 1989; 108: 481-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Anti-αSpIIΣ* like anti-α spectrin had cross-reactivity with β spectrin. This probably indicates a common epitope that is being recognized by these antibodies. This is not unusual, because genes for nonerythroid α and β spectrin encode proteins that are approximately 58–60% identical to their erythroid counterparts (18Goodman S.R. Zimmer W.E. Clark M.B. Zagon J.S. Barber J.E. Bloom M.L. Brain. Res. Bull. 1995; 36: 593-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar,28Ma Y. Zimmer W.E. Riederer B.M. Bloom M.L. Barker J.E. Goodman S.R. Mol.

Bennett V. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 18715-18723Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and between nonerythroid and erythroid α and β spectrin there is also significant homology (18Goodman S.R. Zimmer W.E. Clark M.B. Zagon J.S. Barber J.E. Bloom M.L. Brain. Res. Bull. 1995; 36: 593-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 33Bennett V. Gilligan D.M. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1993; 9: 27-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar). The reduced levels of αSpIIΣ* that we observe in FA-A, FA-B, FA-C, and FA-D cells correlate with the decreased levels of DNA repair synthesis (i.e. unscheduled DNA synthesis) that are observed in these cells in response to DNA interstrand cross-linking agents and with the reduced ability of the protein complex to incise cross-linked DNA (13Lambert, M. W., Tsongalis, G. J., Lambert, W. C., Hang, B., and Parrish, D. D. Mutat. Res. 273, 57–71Google Scholar, 16Brois D.W. McMahon L.W. Ramos N.I. Anglin A.M. Walsh C.E. Lambert M.W. Carcinogenesis. 1999; 20: 1845-1853Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). These values are approximately 25–35% of normal cells (16Brois D.W. McMahon L.W. Ramos N.I. Anglin A.M. Walsh C.E. Lambert M.W. Carcinogenesis. 1999; 20: 1845-1853Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Because we have shown that this protein complex contains a number of the proteins involved in nucleotide excision repair (i.e.XPR, RPA, TFIIH, HHR23B, XPG, ERCC1, XPF, and PCNA) (16Brois D.W. McMahon L.W. Ramos N.I. Anglin A.M. Walsh C.E. Lambert M.W. Carcinogenesis. 1999; 20: 1845-1853Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), it is possible that a role for αSpIIΣ* in the repair process is to act as a scaffold to align these proteins so as to enhance their interactions. This alignment could be particularly important in repair of interstrand cross-links where recombination may be involved (34Thompson L.H. Mutat. Res. 1996; 363: 77-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 35Brookman K.W. Lamerdin J.E. Thelen M.P. Hwang M. Reardon J.T. Sancar A. Zhou Z.-Q. Walter C.A. Parris C.N. Thompson L.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6553-6562Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Reduced levels of αSpIIΣ* in the nucleus would thus be expected to reduce the efficiency of the repair process rather than inhibit it altogether, consistent with our experimental findings. The FANCA and FANCC proteins have been shown to form a complex in the nucleus (36Yamashita T. Kupfer G.M. Vaf D. Suliman A. Joenje H. Asano S. D'Andrea A.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13085-13090Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 37Kupfer G.M. Naf D. Suliman A. Pulsipher M. D'Andrea A.D. Nat. Genet. 1997; 17: 487-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). The present results show that αSpIIΣ* also forms a complex in the nucleus with these proteins. Because studies suggest that FANCA and FANCC may not bind directly to each other in the nucleus but that their interaction may involve another, as yet unknown, protein (36Yamashita T. Kupfer G.M. Vaf D. Suliman A. Joenje H. Asano S. D'Andrea A.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13085-13090Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), it is possible that αSpIIΣ* is this protein. These finding suggest that αSpIIΣ* may act as a scaffold to align or enhance interactions between these two FA proteins, possibly other FA proteins such as FANCG, and proteins involved in DNA repair as well as in other cellular processes. In addition, because levels of αSpIIΣ* are reduced in cells from at least four FA complementation groups (FA-A, FA-B, FA-C, and FA-D), this suggests that these FA genes may all be involved in the stability or expression of this protein. This is further demonstrated by the finding that in FA-A cells expressing theFANCA cDNA, this deficiency in αSpIIΣ* is corrected as is the DNA repair defect (16Brois D.W. McMahon L.W. Ramos N.I. Anglin A.M. Walsh C.E. Lambert M.W. Carcinogenesis. 1999; 20: 1845-1853Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The role of nonerythroid spectrin in the nucleus is not completely understood. Nonerythroid α-spectrin has been shown to be associated with the nuclear matrix (38Bachs O. Lanini L. Serratosa J. Coll M.J. Bastos R. Aligue R. Rius E. Carafoli E. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 18595-18600Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A number of studies suggest that the nuclear matrix is important in DNA repair (39Koehler D.R. Hanawalt P.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 2877-2884Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 40Johnston P.J. MacPhail S.H. Banath J.P. Olive P.L. Radiat.

Res. 1998; 404: 3-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). αSpIIΣ* may link the repair process to the nuclear matrix. α spectrin has also been shown to interact with a number of proteins (17Winkelmann J.C. Forget B.G. Blood. 1993; 81: 3173-3185Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Goodman S.R. Zimmer W.E. Clark M.B. Zagon J.S. Barber J.E. Bloom M.L. Brain. Res. Bull. 1995; 36: 593-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar) and potentially some of these interactions could occur in the nucleus. For example, α spectrin contains a calmodulin binding site and has been shown to associate with this protein (19Leto T.L. Pleasic S. Forget B.G. Benz Jr., E.J. Marchesi V.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 5826-5830Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Wasenius V.-M. Saraste M. Salven P. Eramaa M. Holm L. Lehto V.-P. J.

Genes Cells. 1996; 1: 595-613Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). α spectrin has also been shown to be involved in cell growth and differentiation (17Winkelmann J.C. Forget B.G. Blood. 1993; 81: 3173-3185Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,18Goodman S.R. Zimmer W.E. Clark M.B. Zagon J.S. Barber J.E. Bloom M.L. Brain. Res. Bull. 1995; 36: 593-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). A deficiency in αSpIIΣ* in FA cells could thus have far reaching consequences due to the number of systems affected. This could possibly explain some of the diverse cellular and clinical defects reported in FA, such as cell cycle defects, aberrant induction of apoptosis, and developmental abnormalities (1Glanz A.

Identification of other FA genes and their products should help determine how many of the FA proteins form a complex with αSpIIΣ* and whether these proteins also play a role in the stability or expression of αSpIIΣ*. Elucidation of this relationship may help delineate the function of these FA proteins in the nucleus, the nature of their interaction with αSpIIΣ*, and their role in the deficiency in αSpIIΣ* observed in FA cells.

When expressed in Xenopus oocytes, the β1 subunit modulates the gating properties of the type IIA α subunit, resulting in acceleration of both inactivation and recovery from inactivation and in a negative shift in the voltage dependence of fast inactivation. The β1 subunit is composed of an extracellular domain with a single immunoglobulin-like fold, a single transmembrane segment, and a small intracellular domain. A series of chimeras with exchanges of domains between the Na+ channel β1 and β2 subunits and between β1 and the structurally related protein myelin P0 were constructed and analyzed by two-microelectrode voltage clamp in Xenopusoocytes. Only chimeras containing the β1 extracellular domain were capable of β1-like modulation of Na+ channel gating. Neither the transmembrane segment nor the intracellular domain was required for modulation, although mutation of Glu158 within the transmembrane domain altered the voltage dependence of steady-state inactivation. A truncated β1 subunit was engineered in which the β1 extracellular domain was fused to a recognition sequence for attachment of a glycosylphosphatidylinositol membrane anchor.

Na+channel inactivation is accelerated 5-fold, the voltage dependence of fast inactivation is shifted in the negative direction, and a larger fraction of channels recovers rapidly from inactivation. In addition, the peak amplitude of Na+ current is increased, consistent with an increase in cell surface expression.

In contrast, another study reported that the transmembrane segment of the β1 subunit expressed alone was sufficient for Na+ channel modulation (13Shah R.M. Henderson L.P. Jones J.R. Huang G.J. Maue R.A. Soc. Neurosci. Abstr. 1996; 22 (abstr.): 63Google Scholar), and a human long QT syndrome mutation has implicated intracellular sequences in β1 function (14An R.H. Wang X.L. Kerem B. Benhorin J. Medina A. Goldmit M. Kass R.S. Circ. Res. 1998; 83: 141-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). In the experiments presented here, we have analyzed the functional properties of a series of chimeras between β1 subunits and either β2 subunits or the structurally related myelin protein zero (P0), as well as a construct in which the extracellular domain of β1 is attached to a glycophosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor. Our results show that the extracellular domain of the β1 subunit is both necessary and sufficient for modulation of Na+ channel gating.DISCUSSIONPrevious work has highlighted the importance of the β1 extracellular domain in modulation of Na+ channel function (8McCormick K.A.

Res. 1996; 78: 244-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) and led to the working hypothesis that the Ig fold motif in the β1 extracellular domain serves as a scaffold to present molecular determinants of β1 for interaction with the α subunit. This interaction causes an increase in the fraction of channels that gate in a fast mode (8McCormick K.A. Isom L.L. Ragsdale D. Smith D. Scheuer T. Catterall W.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3954-3962Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Negatively charged residues predicted to lie in the A/A′ β strand on one edge of the Ig fold were shown to be important for modulation of gating mode (8McCormick K.A. Isom L.L. Ragsdale D. Smith D. Scheuer T. Catterall W.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3954-3962Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). The extracellular loop IVSS2-S6 in the α subunit has also been identified as a point of attachment of the β1 subunit (12Makita N. Bennett Jr., P.B. George Jr., A.L. Circ. Res. 1996; 78: 244-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 27Qu Y. Rogers J.C. Chen S.-F. McCormick K.A. Scheuer T. Catterall W.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32647-32654Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). In contrast with these experiments, studies in which the transmembrane domain of the β1 subunit was expressed as a separate protein suggested that the transmembrane domain could modulate sodium channel gating by itself (13Shah R.M. Henderson L.P. Jones J.R. Huang G.J. Maue R.A. Soc. Neurosci. Abstr. 1996; 22 (abstr.): 63Google Scholar). Moreover, human heart α subunits containing a mutation in the intracellular C-terminal tail are linked to long QT syndrome and are functionally abnormal only when co-expressed with the β1 subunit (14An R.H. Wang X.L. Kerem B. Benhorin J. Medina A. Goldmit M. Kass R.S. Circ. Res. 1998; 83: 141-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). In the experiments described here, we have further examined the possibility that the modulation of Na+ channel gating conferred by the β1 subunit is indeed due to extracellular interactions using chimeric and lipid-anchored β1 subunits.The Transmembrane Domain of the β1 Subunit Is Not Sufficient for Na+ Channel ModulationIf the transmembrane domain were necessary for β1 function, one would expect to observe loss of function for the β1P0β1 chimera and for β1ec-GPI. Alternatively, if the transmembrane domain were sufficient for β1 function, one would expect to observe β1-like function for the P0β1P0 chimera. Our results show the opposite. The β1P0β1 chimera and β1ec-GPI conferred wild-type levels of β1 modulation of Na+ channel gating, whereas the P0β1P0 chimera lacked β1 function. The expression of channels containing the β1P0β1 chimeras was delayed, probably because of protein folding problems caused by the longer, P0-derived transmembrane segment. We did observe a small but significant acceleration of recovery from inactivation in oocytes expressing the αIIA subunit in combination with high levels of either the P0β1P0 or P0β1β1 chimeras. In general, the Na+ currents mediated by these chimeras in oocytes having fast recovery kinetics were very small (<1 μA; data not shown). Because both of these chimeras contain the P0 extracellular domain, it is likely that residues within the P0 Ig fold motif can accelerate the recovery process but with much lower efficacy than the wild-type β1 subunit. This idea is plausible, because there are several short regions of sequence identity within the extracellular domains of β1 and P0 (8McCormick K.A. Isom L.L. Ragsdale D. Smith D. Scheuer T. Catterall W.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3954-3962Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). The results of our experiments with chimeras demonstrate that the transmembrane domain of the β1 subunit cannot support modulation of sodium channel gating and therefore that its role in interactions with and modulation of the α subunit is secondary to that of the extracellular domain. This conclusion is further supported by our results showing that β1ec-GPI is fully active in channel modulation.Removal of a Negatively Charged Residue in the β1 Transmembrane Domain Causes a Larger Hyperpolarizing Shift in the Voltage Dependence of Steady-state InactivationWe observed that the replacement of the β1 transmembrane segment with that of myelin protein P0, as well as the complete removal of the transmembrane domain, resulted in a more pronounced negative shift in the voltage dependence of steady-state fast inactivation than that measured for channels containing the wild-type β1 subunit. These effects could be mimicked by neutralizing or charge replacement mutations at position β1E158, located within the transmembrane segment. Therefore, although it is unusual for a charged residue to be found in a transmembrane segment, β1E158 does appear to play a significant role in determining the voltage dependence of inactivation. This suggests that β1E158 is situated where it can alter the electric field sensed by the gating charges that control inactivation or can interact with them directly or indirectly through the protein structure.The Extracellular Domain of the Na+ Channel β1 Subunit Is Sufficient for Modulation of Gating ModeWe found that chimera β1β2β2, in which the only extracellular domain is derived from β1, modulates channel function in a manner indistinguishable from that of wild-type β1. This agrees with previous experiments with skeletal muscle Na+ channels and a β1-β2 chimera that contained the extracellular domain plus six adjacent transmembrane amino acid residues derived from β1 (12Makita N. Bennett Jr., P.B. George Jr., A.L. Circ. Res. 1996; 78: 244-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Our data narrow the region required for β1 function in β1-β2 chimeras to residues in the extracellular domain. In addition, the β1 extracellular domain is functional when spliced to the transmembrane and intracellular domains of myelin protein P0. Chimera β1P0P0 yielded channels with fast inactivation, negatively shifted voltage dependence of steady-state inactivation, and rapid recovery from inactivation. On the other hand, channels containing chimera P0β1P0 were slow to inactivate, showed no negative shift in the voltage dependence of inactivation, and had slow recovery from inactivation. Taken together, the results of the β1-β2 and β1-P0 chimeras strongly implicate the β1 extracellular domain as the region involved in the modulation of Na+ channel gating.In further support of the conclusion that only the extracellular domain of the β1 subunit is necessary, we found that the GPI-anchored β1 extracellular domain is able to mimic the effects of the intact β1 subunit for all parameters tested. This is a clear demonstration that the action of the β1 subunit on channel modulation is primarily or exclusively via extracellular contacts. Our data from experiments assessing recovery from fast inactivation show that the β1ec-GPI protein fully shifts the αIIA subunit to the fast gating mode. Moreover, the association of β1ec with the α subunit is stable for several days, consistent with stable, high affinity interaction like the native β1 subunit.In addition to causing changes in the gating kinetics of the Na+ channel, the β1 subunit has also been shown to enhance Na+ channel expression in both Xenopusoocytes and mammalian cells (6Isom L.L.

It would be interesting to determine which domain of the β1 subunit is responsible for this increase in channel cell surface expression. Chimeras between the β1 subunit and myelin P0 proved difficult to analyze in this respect. In general, the chimeras between β1 and P0 expressed poorly, yielding Na+ currents that were smaller on average than those observed for channels composed of only the αIIA subunit. This dilemma was circumvented by the successful expression of Na+ channels containing the GPI-anchored β1 extracellular domain. These channels expressed well, with current amplitudes comparable with those observed for α + wild-type β1 subunits. The data suggest that the β1 extracellular domain is sufficient for increasing channel cell surface expression as well as modulation of gating.Mechanism of Modulation of Gating by β1 SubunitsIt is surprising that the extracellular domain of β1, independent of the transmembrane and intracellular segments, can alter Na+channel gating. Activation of Na+ channels involves outward movement of the S4 transmembrane segments, which serve as voltage sensors (29Yang N. George Jr., A.L. Horn R. Neuron. 1996; 16: 113-122Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (530) Google Scholar, 30Cha A. Ruben P.C. George A.L.J. Fujimoto E. Bezanilla F. Neuron. 1999; 22: 73-87Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). Fast inactivation is largely an intracellular event involving closure of an inactivation gate formed by the intracellular loop between domains III and IV (31Armstrong C.M. Bezanilla F. Rojas E. J.

Chem. 1996; 271: 30971-30979Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Because the β1 subunit is unlikely to interact directly with either of these gating structures, it seems reasonable to propose that the β1 extracellular domain influences or evokes a conformational change in the α subunit and thereby affects channel gating indirectly through the protein structure. Polypeptide toxins from scorpions and sea anemones are also able to modulate Na+ channel gating by interaction with a site on the extracellular face of the channel, and, in that case, direct interaction of the bound toxins with the S3-S4 loops at the extracellular end of the S4 gating segments is proposed to mediate the actions of the toxins via a voltage-sensor trapping model (35Rogers J.C.

Scheuer T. Catterall W.A. Neuron. 1998; 21: 919-931Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). Likewise, small mutations in the S3-S4 loops of potassium channels have profound effects on voltage-dependent gating (37Tang C.Y. Papazian D.M. J. Gen. Physiol. 1997; 109: 301-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The β1 subunit may also influence the movement of one or more S4 gating segments, perhaps by interacting with the S3-S4 loop of one or more homologous domains and, in that way, alter the kinetics and voltage dependence of channel gating.Significance of the Extracellular Domain of the β1 Subunit in VivoIt was recently discovered that a mutation of a Cys residue predicted to be disulfide-linked in the Ig fold in the extracellular domain of β1 is responsible for an inherited form of febrile seizure (38Wallace R.H. Wang D.W. Singh R. Scheffer I.E. George A.L.J. Phillips H.A. Saar K. Reis A. Johnson E.W. Sutherland G.R. Berkovic S.F. Mulley J.C. Nat. Genet. 1998; 19: 366-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). This finding demonstrates the physiological importance of the Na+ channel β1 subunit and again emphasizes the role of the Ig fold in the β1 extracellular domain in regulation of Na+ channel function. Further molecular and structural analysis may reveal both the mechanism of action of the β1 subunits and the molecular basis for this inherited seizure syndrome. The voltage-gated Na+ channel is responsible for the increase in Na+ permeability during the initial rapidly rising phase of the action potential in neurons and other excitable cells. Na+ channels in rat brain contain an α subunit of 260 kDa in association with auxiliary β1 and β2 subunits of 36 and 33 kDa, respectively (1Catterall W.A. Physiol.

Our results show that the extracellular domain of the β1 subunit is both necessary and sufficient for modulation of Na+ channel gating. DISCUSSIONPrevious work has highlighted the importance of the β1 extracellular domain in modulation of Na+ channel function (8McCormick K.A. Isom L.L. Ragsdale D. Smith D. Scheuer T. Catterall W.A.

This interaction causes an increase in the fraction of channels that gate in a fast mode (8McCormick K.A. Isom L.L. Ragsdale D. Smith D. Scheuer T. Catterall W.A. J. Biol.

Negatively charged residues predicted to lie in the A/A′ β strand on one edge of the Ig fold were shown to be important for modulation of gating mode (8McCormick K.A. Isom L.L. Ragsdale D. Smith D.

The extracellular loop IVSS2-S6 in the α subunit has also been identified as a point of attachment of the β1 subunit (12Makita N. Bennett Jr., P.B. George Jr., A.L. Circ.

In contrast with these experiments, studies in which the transmembrane domain of the β1 subunit was expressed as a separate protein suggested that the transmembrane domain could modulate sodium channel gating by itself (13Shah"

Near complete enzyme activity can be reconstituted by combining recombinant polypeptides that approximate the core and COOH-terminal domains, although DNA binding is reduced somewhat for the reconstituted enzyme (Stewart, L., Ireton, G. C., and Champoux, J. J. (1997) J. Mol. Biol.269, 355–372). A reconstituted enzyme comprising the core domain plus a COOH-terminal fragment containing the complete linker region exhibits the same biochemical properties as a reconstituted enzyme lacking the linker altogether, and thus detachment of the linker from the core domain renders the linker non-functional. The rate of religation by the reconstituted enzyme is increased relative to the forms of the enzyme containing the linker indicating that in the intact enzyme the linker slows religation. Relaxation of plasmid DNA by full-length human topoisomerase I or a 70-kDa form of the enzyme that is missing only the non-essential NH2-terminal domain (topo70) is inhibited ∼16-fold by the anticancer compound, camptothecin, whereas the reconstituted enzyme is nearly resistant to the inhibitory effects of the drug despite similar affinities for the drug by the two forms of the enzyme. Based on these results and in light of the crystal structure of human topoisomerase I, we propose that the linker plays a role in hindering supercoil relaxation during the normal relaxation reaction and that camptothecin inhibition of DNA relaxation depends on a direct effect of the drug on DNA rotation that is also dependent on the linker.

The transient break allows helical tension to be released by the unwinding of positively supercoiled DNA or the rewinding of negatively supercoiled DNA. Phosphodiester bond energy is preserved during catalysis through the formation of a covalent link between the active site tyrosine and the 3′ end of the broken strand. Strand closure follows the reverse path with reformation of the phosphodiester linkage and release of the enzyme.

Numerous structure-activity studies have established a direct correlation between the ability of CPT and its derivatives to slow religation and their capacity to inhibit the relaxation of superhelical tension in DNA (15Hertzberg R.P.

Based on such studies, it is generally believed that the inhibitory effects of CPT on topoisomerase I relaxing activity are a direct consequence of the effect of the drug on religation.The three-dimensional structure of an NH2-terminally deleted 70-kDa form of human topoisomerase I (topo70) (Fig. 1) bound to a high affinity duplex DNA substrate has recently been solved (22Stewart L.

The highly charged NH2-terminal domain (Met1–Gly214) is largely disordered, contains four putative nuclear localization signals (27Alsner J. Svejstrup J.Q. Kjeldsen E. Sorensen B.S. Westergaard O. J. Biol.

CRC Press Inc., Boca Raton, FL1993: 121-130Google Scholar). The conserved core domain (Ile215–Ala635) can be divided into three subdomains. The first half of the core is composed of subdomains I and II, which form a “cap” structure that wraps half way around the DNA and has two positively charged “nose cone” helices that are positioned above, but do not contact the DNA in the region downstream of the site of covalent attachment. (Fig. 2, black). The second half of the core domain, subdomain III (Fig. 2, red), is structurally related to the integrase family of tyrosine recombinases (23Redinbo M.R. Stewart L. Kuhn P. Champoux J.J. Hol W.G. Science. 1998; 279: 1504-1513Crossref PubMed Scopus (764) Google Scholar). This portion of the core domain is referred to here as the “catalytic” segment of the enzyme since it contains three essential active site residues, Arg488, Arg590, and His632 (22Stewart L. Redinbo M.R. Qiu X. Hol W.G. Champoux J.J. Science. 1998; 279: 1534-1541Crossref PubMed Scopus (611) Google Scholar, 23Redinbo M.R. Stewart L. Kuhn P. Champoux J.J. Hol W.G. Science. 1998; 279: 1504-1513Crossref PubMed Scopus (764) Google Scholar). The COOH-terminal domain (residues Gln713 to Phe765; Fig.2, green) forms a tight complex with core subdomain III and completes the active site by providing the nucleophilic Tyr723 (6Madden K.R. Champoux J.J. Cancer Res. 1992; 52: 525-532PubMed Google Scholar, 28D'Arpa P. Machlin P.S. Ratrie H.d. Rothfield N.F. Cleveland D.W. Earnshaw W.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 2543-2547Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). Together, the core and COOH-terminal domains wrap completely around the DNA making numerous contacts with phosphates in the −5 to +1 duplex region where the break site is defined to be between the −1 and +1 positions on the scissile strand. The linker domain comprising residues Pro636 to Lys712 connects the core and COOH-terminal domains (Fig. 2, orange). The linker assumes a protruding coiled-coil conformation that is stabilized by hydrophobic side chain interactions between conserved heptad repeating residues. Importantly, the conserved side chains of linker residues Lys650 and Arg708 form hydrogen bonds with phosphates downstream of the break site in the +8 to +10 duplex region of the DNA.Figure 2The crystal structure of human topoisomerase I. A stereodiagram shows human topo70 bound non-covalently to DNA. Together, the core subdomains I and II comprise the “cap” region of human topoisomerase I (black), with helices α5 and α6 forming the “nose cone.” Core subdomain III is structurally homologous to the integrase family of tyrosine recombinases (red). The “linker” domain (orange) forms a coiled-coil structure that makes two contacts, mediated by residues Lys650 and Arg708 shown in cyan, with the duplex DNA located downstream of the topoisomerase I cleavage site. The positively charged side chains of nose cone residues, which face the DNA, are also shown in cyan. The non-cleaved strand of the DNA is shown in blue, while the scissile strand is shown in dark magenta upstream (−10 to −1) of the nicking site and in pink downstream (+1 to +12).

Ireton G.C. Champoux J.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 269: 355-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). The COOH-terminal fragments bind tightly to the core domain, forming a 1:1 complex that is stable irrespective of ionic strength (0.01–1m). In a plasmid relaxation assay under standard conditions (150 mm KCl without Mg2+), the reconstituted enzymes display near full activity when compared with topo70 (residues Lys175–Phe765), whose activity is indistinguishable from that of the native full-length human topoisomerase I (24Stewart L. Ireton G.C. Parker L.H. Madden K.R. Champoux J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7593-7601Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). However, the reconstituted enzymes are inactive at salt concentrations above 250 mm KCl, while topo70 remains active at salt concentrations as high as 350 mmKCl. Consistent with the lack of activity at the higher ionic strengths, the reconstituted enzymes are significantly less processive and bind DNA with ∼20-fold lower affinity than the intact topo70. Furthermore, the cleavage-religation equilibrium of the reconstituted enzymes is strongly biased toward religation relative to that of the intact enzyme (26Stewart L. Ireton G.C. Champoux J.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 269: 355-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar).Despite their biochemical differences, the reconstituted and intact enzymes have identical sequence specificity for DNA cleavage (26Stewart L. Ireton G.C. Champoux J.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 269: 355-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). The x-ray crystal structures of the two proteins bound non-covalently to DNA are also very similar, and the only difference appears to be that the reconstituted enzyme is missing one and probably both of the phosphate contacts contributed by linker domain residues Lys650 and Arg708 (22Stewart L. Redinbo M.R. Qiu X. Hol W.G. Champoux J.J. Science. 1998; 279: 1534-1541Crossref PubMed Scopus (611) Google Scholar). Arg708 is not present in the reconstituted enzyme and, although Lys650 is part of the crystallized topo58/6.3-DNA complex, it is contained within a 24-amino acid region (residues Pro636–Ala659) that fails to adopt a stable conformation in the crystalline state. The loss of these two linker-DNA contacts provides a possible explanation for the ∼20-fold reduced DNA affinity exhibited by the reconstituted enzyme. Evidence that the linker domain also contacts DNA in solution is supported by proteolysis studies, which show that the linker is ∼10-fold more resistant to limited proteolysis when the enzyme (full-length or topo70) is bound non-covalently to duplex DNA (25Stewart L. Ireton G.C. Champoux J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7602-7608Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar).In the present work we have extended our biochemical comparison of the intact and reconstituted enzymes and have found that CPT inhibits plasmid DNA relaxation by the reconstituted enzymes (topo58/12 and topo58/6.3) by less than 2-fold under standard assay conditions, whereas relaxation by topo70 is inhibited ∼16-fold under the same conditions. We show that this effect is not the result of reduced binding of CPT to the reconstituted enzymes as compared with topo70. These results implicate the linker region of the enzyme in CPT inhibition of plasmid DNA relaxation.DISCUSSIONThe evidence presented here indicates that the linker domain in the enzyme reconstituted by mixing the core (topo58) and COOH-terminal fragment (topo12) assumes a different conformation from that found in the intact enzyme (22Stewart L. Redinbo M.R. Qiu X. Hol W.G. Champoux J.J. Science. 1998; 279: 1534-1541Crossref PubMed Scopus (611) Google Scholar). Topo58/12 chromatographs in a gel filtration analysis with an apparent molecular mass that is almost 50% larger than the apparent molecular mass observed for topo70 (134 kDaversus 91 kDa), despite the fact that the two proteins differ in amino acid composition only by the presence of 4 extra amino acids in topo58/12. Furthermore, although the intact linker region of topo70 is protected from limited proteolysis in both noncovalent (26Stewart L. Ireton G.C. Champoux J.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 269: 355-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) and covalent complexes with DNA (this work), the linker region in topo58/12 is as sensitive to proteolysis in the presence of DNA as in its absence. The most likely explanation for the difference in gel filtration properties and the sensitivity of the linker to proteolysis in the presence of DNA is that the linker domain is improperly folded or oriented differently relative to the remainder of the protein in topo58/12 as compared with topo70 (22Stewart L. Redinbo M.R. Qiu X. Hol W.G. Champoux J.J. Science. 1998; 279: 1534-1541Crossref PubMed Scopus (611) Google Scholar). One possibility is that the detached linker in topo58/12 retains its coiled-coiled state (22Stewart L. Redinbo M.R. Qiu X. Hol W.G. Champoux J.J. Science. 1998; 279: 1534-1541Crossref PubMed Scopus (611) Google Scholar), but swings further away from the body of the protein to a position which may even be perpendicular to the axis of the DNA (see Fig. 2). Such a re-orientation could dramatically increase the asymmetry of the molecule to affect its gel filtration properties and at the same time result in an increased accessibility to proteases both in the presence and absence of bound DNA.Both of the reconstituted forms of human topoisomerase I studied here, topo58/12 and topo58/6.3, are less sensitive to CPT in a plasmid relaxation assay than is the wild type enzyme as exemplified by topo70. We propose that the lack of a functional linker accounts for the reduced sensitivity to CPT in both cases. While topo58/6.3 lacks the linker region altogether, topo58/12 appears to have a misfolded nonfunctional linker resulting from the discontinuity in the polypeptide chain at the core-linker boundary. We chose to more extensively characterize topo58/12 with respect to other parameters affected by CPT since it differs the least from topo70 in total amino acid content.We previously showed that the lack of a linker region in the reconstituted enzymes shifts the cleavage-religation equilibrium toward religation by a factor of about 20 (26Stewart L. Ireton G.C. Champoux J.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 269: 355-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Since the cleavage-religation equilibrium (K CR) is equal tok cl/k r (34Stivers J.T. Shuman S. Mildvan A.S. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 327-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), such a shift could result from either an increase in the rate of religation or a decrease in the rate of cleavage. Since kr is inversely proportional to t 1/2 for the religation reaction, the data in Table II allow us to estimate that there is an increase in k r by a factor of about 60 (t 1/2 of 4.6 min versus ∼0.08 min) for the reconstituted topo58/12 relative to topo70. Thus, it appears that we can account for the entire shift in the cleavage-religation equilibrium upon loss of a functional linker by a increase in the rate of religation. If there is an effect on k cl, it would appear to be a modest one. Therefore, the presence of the linker in the intact enzyme under normal circumstances acts to slow religation. Since this effect is observed with oligonucleotide substrates where there is no supercoiling to drive strand rotation, the reduction in kr in the intact enzyme as compared with the reconstituted enzymes must result from some feature of the enzyme-DNA complex not related to the effects of the linker on DNA relaxation described below. Whether this effect acts directly at the level of the active site geometry to alter the chemistry of catalysis, or is mediated through DNA contacts by the linker downstream of the break site (see Fig. 2) (22Stewart L. Redinbo M.R. Qiu X. Hol W.G. Champoux J.J. Science. 1998; 279: 1534-1541Crossref PubMed Scopus (611) Google Scholar) to distort the DNA such that reclosure is slowed remains unknown. The only crystal structure of human topoisomerase I in a covalent complex with DNA involves the reconstituted form of the enzyme missing the linker altogether (topo58/6.3) (23Redinbo M.R. Stewart L. Kuhn P. Champoux J.J. Hol W.G. Science. 1998; 279: 1504-1513Crossref PubMed Scopus (764) Google Scholar). Consistent with the above prediction, the 5′ hydroxyl of the broken strand is perfectly positioned for reclosure in this complex lacking the linker. At present, a crystal structure of the covalent complex with the linker present is not yet available to provide structural insights into how the linker slows the religation phase of the reaction. A corollary to the above considerations is that the rate-limiting step for religation by the linker-containing enzyme occurs at some stage prior to the actual religation chemistry as originally suggested by Stivers et al. (35Stivers J.T. Shuman S. Mildvan A.S. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 15449-15458Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar).A number of CPT-resistant forms of human and yeast topoisomerase I have been identified that involve single amino acid changes at a variety of sites within the protein (36Champoux J.J. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 1998; 60: 111-132Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The most likely explanation for the loss of sensitivity to CPT in these cases is that a structural alteration in the protein results in a reduced affinity of the enzyme-DNA covalent complex for the drug. Since CPT slows religation for topo58/12 to the same extent as for topo70 (4-fold in both cases, Table II), the drug still binds to the covalent intermediates formed by the reconstituted enzyme. Furthermore, since the magnitude of the effects of CPT on DNA relaxation by topo58/12 cannot be increased by higher drug concentrations (Fig. 4), a reduced affinity for the drug is an unlikely explanation for the low degree of inhibition in plasmid relaxation. We therefore propose that the basis for the reduced sensitivity to CPT of topo58/12 and topo58/6.3 in the plasmid relaxation assay is likely to be found in some step beyond the binding of the drug to the enzyme-DNA covalent complex. Previous work has established a correlation between the ability of CPT to slow religation and its ability to inhibit DNA relaxation (15Hertzberg R.P. Caranfa M.J. Hecht S.M.

Jaxel C. Heise C.R. Kerrigan D. Kohn K.W. Potmesil M. Kohn K.W. DNA Topoisomerases in Cancer. Oxford University Press, New York1991: 121-132Google Scholar). The greatly reduced effect of CPT on relaxation by the reconstituted enzymes despite an effect on the rate of religation suggests that these two properties can be separated by altering the structure of the enzyme.To understand how CPT inhibits the relaxation reaction by the wild type topoisomerase and why CPT sensitivity is lost in the absence of a functional linker, it is useful to consider the relationship between the various kinetic parameters that determine the rate of DNA relaxation. At a molar excess of plasmid DNA over enzyme, the overall rate of relaxation is a function of (i) the cleavage rate (k cl), (ii) the dissociation rate of enzyme from the product, and (iii) the average number of supercoils that are relaxed per cleavage event (Δn). To a first approximation, we argue above that the cleavage rates for the two forms of the enzyme are equal, thus eliminating k cl as a major determinant of the differential relaxation rates in the absence and presence of CPT. For topo70, the lack of topoisomer intermediates during the course of the relaxation reaction (see Fig. 3,panels A and B) indicates that the enzyme completely relaxes a substrate in a processive fashion before dissociating and reassociating with another DNA molecule. It has been shown previously that the intact enzyme binds preferentially to supercoiled DNA over the relaxed product (37Madden K.R. Stewart L. Champoux J.J. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5399-5409Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) and thus once the DNA is relaxed the enzyme readily redistributes to an unreacted substrate molecule. Furthermore, under the conditions of the relaxation assay, the concentrations of the enzyme and substrate are well above the dissociation constant and thus once dissociation does occur, rebinding is rapid. Thus, for topo70, we can assume that all of the enzyme molecules are bound to the DNA. However, under these conditions, the rate-limiting step in the multiple turnover relaxation reaction is likely to be the rate of release of the enzyme from the relaxed product as predicted by Stivers et al. (34Stivers J.T. Shuman S. Mildvan A.S. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 327-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). The situation with the reconstituted enzyme is somewhat different since partially relaxed topoisomers are visible during the course of the relaxation reaction (see Fig. 3, panels C and D). Thus, in this case and consistent with the reduced affinity of the reconstituted enzyme for DNA (26Stewart L. Ireton G.C. Champoux J.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 269: 355-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), the reaction is distributive with the enzyme dissociating from partially relaxed molecules during the reaction. Finally, once cleavage of a supercoiled DNA has occurred, the DNA can either be reclosed without any relaxation, or supercoils can be relaxed before religation with a rate equal to k sup(number of supercoils relaxed per second) (38Stivers J.T. Harris T.K. Mildvan A.S. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 5212-5222Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The ratio of the rate constants for these two competing reactions determines the number of supercoils that are removed each time the enzyme cleaves the DNA (i.e. Δn =k sup/k r) (38Stivers J.T. Harris T.K. Mildvan A.S. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 5212-5222Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Although the ratio of these two parameters has not been measured for human topoisomerase I, the value ofk sup/k r for the vaccinia enzyme has been determined to be approximately 5, i.e. 5 supercoils are relaxed on the average for each nicking-closing cycle (38Stivers J.T. Harris T.K. Mildvan A.S. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 5212-5222Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar).Based on these considerations, how can we account for the approximately 2-fold slower plasmid DNA relaxation rate for topo58/12 as compared with topo70 despite the very large increase in the rate of religation for the reconstituted enzyme? One factor that likely leads to the slightly slower rate is the reduced affinity of the reconstituted enzyme for the DNA so that, unlike topo70, not all of the enzyme molecules are bound to the DNA at any given instant. However, given that k r for topo58/12 is ∼60 times greater than k r for topo70, if we assume equal rates of supercoil release by the two forms of the enzyme (i.e. k sup(topo70) =k sup(topo58/12)) then the number of supercoils relaxed per nicking-closing cycle (Δn =k sup/k r) should be 60 times fewer for the reconstituted enzyme as compared with topo70. Since the number of supercoils released per nicking event is likely to be a major determinant of the overall rate of relaxation, it seems unlikely that a 60-fold reduction in the value of Δn would"

We have identified adherent cell lines where lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) strongly and rapidly activates the accumulation of PI3K lipid products. The process is not modified by expression of a kinase-dead mutant of the Gβγ-responsive PI3K p110γ. In contrast, it is inhibited by genistein or expression of a dominant negative mutant of p85 and potentiated by overexpressing wild-type p110α or -β but not -γ. By using a specific chemical inhibitor of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and expression of a dominant negative mutant, we have observed that recruitment of p85/p110 PI3Ks occurs through transactivation of the EGFR by LPA and downstream mobilization of the docking protein Gab1 that associates with p85 upon LPA stimulation. Finally, we show that LPA cannot activate PI3K in cell lines lacking the EGFR/Gab1 pathway, including cells that transactivate the PDGF receptor. Altogether, these results demonstrate that activation of PI3K by LPA is conditioned by the ability of LPA to transactivate an EGFR/Gab1 signaling pathway.

Intensive researches have recently focused on the identification of proteins that could make the link between G proteins and the Ras/MAPK cascade, leading to the identification of various protein tyrosine kinases involved in this process, such as Pyk2 (2Lev S.

Nature. 1996; 380: 541-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). However, the mechanisms of activation of these kinases by GPCR have not been elucidated, except for Pyk2 that is recruited by a Gq-Ca2+-dependent pathway (2Lev S. Moreno H. Martinez R. Canoll P. Peles E. Musacchio J.M. Plowman G.D. Rudy B. Schlessinger J. Nature. 1995; 376: 737-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (1242) Google Scholar). On the other hand, phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) has been recently shown to play a major role in the early mechanisms of GPCR-mediated activation of the Ras/MAPK pathway (7Ferby I.M. Waga I.

However, the fact that PI3K inhibitors interfere with GPCR-induced signaling even in non-hematopoietic cell lines is difficult to interpret since GPCRs agonists are not known to induce the synthesis of PI3K lipid products in these cells. In contrast, neutrophils for example produce large amounts of phosphatidylinositol 3,4-bisphosphate (PI3,4P2) and phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PIP3) upon stimulation with GPCR agonists (12Stephens L.R. Jackson T.R. Hawkins P.T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1179: 27-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar). Similarly, stimulation of cells by RTK agonists such as platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) generate PI3K lipid products through well known pathways, and PI3K inhibitors interfere with RTK-mediated activation of the Ras/MAPK pathway, although the mechanisms have to be clarified (13Duckworth B.C. Cantley L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27665-27670Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Thus, one important question still remains concerning the regulation of PI3K in GPCR-induced signaling in non-myeloid cells. Recently, two groups have identified a novel isoform of PI3K, p110γ, which contains a pleckstrin homology domain in its N terminus region. Interestingly, p110γ can be directly activated by G protein subunits (14Stoyanov B. Volinia S. Hanck T. Rubio I. Loubtchenkov M. Malek D. Stoyanova S. Vanhaesebroeck B. Dhand R. Nurnberg B.

Erdjument-Bromage H. Lui M. Cooke F. Coadwell J. Smrcka A.S. Thelen M. Cadwallader K. Tempst P. Hawkins P.T.

Nurnberg B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7024-7029Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Although this isoform of PI3K plays a role in the activation of the Ras/MAPK pathway by G proteins (17Lopez-Ilasaca M. Crespo P. Pellici P.G. Gutkind J.S. Wetzker R.

EMBO J. 1999; 18: 386-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar), it is not clear yet whether this enzyme is involved in any GPCR-induced PIP3 production in non-hematopoietic cell lines (15Stephens L.R.

Science. 1998; 282: 293-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). On the other hand, p110β was recently found to play a role in GPCR-induced signaling and mitogenesis (20Kurosu H. Maehama T.

Raynal P. Courtneidge S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 7119-7129Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, this led us to study the activation of PI3K by GPCR in adherent cell lines. We have measured PI3K lipid products upon stimulation with lysophosphatidic acid (LPA), and we have identified cell lines producing large amounts of PI3,4P2 and PIP3 upon treatment with a GPCR agonist. The mechanism does not seem to involve the p110γ isoform of PI3K but recruits the p85/p110 isoforms through LPA-induced mobilization of the EGF receptor (EGFR) and subsequent engagement of the docking protein Gab1. Finally, we show that LPA cannot activate PI3K in various cell types lacking the EGFR/Gab1 pathway, thereby demonstrating the pivotal role of this transactivation pathway for PI3K activation by LPA in non-myeloid-derived cell lines.

Cells grown in 10-cm plates were serum-starved for 24 h upon reaching 80–90% confluence and then labeled for 5 h with 0.2 mCi of [32P]H3PO4 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) per ml in phosphate-free DMEM. Cells were then stimulated for the indicated time and washed once with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline before addition of 3.75 ml of 2.4 m HCl solution. Then lipid extraction was performed as described previously (27Ireton K. Payrastre B. Chap H. Ogawa W. Sakaue H. Kasuga M. Cossart P. Science. 1996; 274: 780-782Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). Briefly, lipids were solubilized by addition of 3 ml of chloroform and 4.5 ml of methanol followed by vortexing. After centrifugation, the lower phase containing the lipids was collected, and the upper phase was washed with 4.5 ml of chloroform. The lower phases were then combined and evaporated under nitrogen, and lipid extracts were solubilized in 250 μl of chloroform/methanol (1/1, v/v) and first resolved by thin layer chromatography (TLC) using chloroform/acetone/methanol/acetic acid/water (80/30/26/24/14,v/v). The spots corresponding to PI4,5P2/PI3,4P2, and PIP3 were then scraped off, deacylated by 20% methylamine, and analyzed by HPLC on a Whatman Partisphere 5 SAX column. For measurements of PI polyphosphate after transfection of Cos cells with dominant negative mutants, the results represent the mean ± S.E. of three independent experiments. For each experiment, the inhibitory effect of the mutant has been normalized for the percentage of transfected cells. This was determined concurrently using β-galactosidase as reporter and following a standard procedure. The efficiency of transfection was routinely around 40%. Stimulations were carried out at 37 °C in serum-free DMEM containing 20 mm Hepes. Cells were washed once with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline before lysis. For immunoblotting of crude lysates, cells were scraped off in SDS-PAGE sample buffer and boiled 5 min, then resolved by SDS-PAGE, and analyzed by immunoblotting using an enzyme-linked chemiluminescence system (ECL, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Results obtained with anti-phospho-Akt, and Erk antibodies were quantified by densitometry. We have verified that results obtained with the anti-phospho-Erk antibody did not differ from in vitro kinase assays of immunoprecipitated HA-Erk1 (construct kindly provided by Dr. J. Pouyssegur) using myelin basic protein as a substrate. For immunoprecipitations, cells were scraped off in lysis buffer containing 150 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1% Brij (Sigma catalog number P9641), 1 mm Na3VO4, and 10 μg/ml aprotinin and leupeptin. After gentle shaking during 20 min at 4 °C and centrifugation (13,000 rpm for 10 min), the supernatants were incubated 1 h with antibodies followed by addition of 10% (w/v) protein A-Sepharose CL4B (Sigma) for 1 h. The immunecomplexes were washed twice with 1 ml of lysis buffer containing 0.1% Brij, 100 μm Na3VO4, and 1 μg/ml aprotinin and leupeptin and finally boiled in SDS-PAGE sample buffer. For GST pull-down experiments, cells were processed similarly to the immunoprecipitation protocol, except that cells were incubated 1 h with 2 μg of GST fusion protein immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). To gain insight into the regulation of PI3K by LPA, we have measured the amount of PI3K lipid products in serum-starved cells stimulated with LPA. 1 μm LPA induced an important accumulation of PI3,4P2 and PIP3in both Vero and Cos cells, at a level up to 10-fold higher than control, with a maximum after 2 min stimulation (Fig.1, A and B). Dose-response assays indicated that the effect was detectable with as low as 0.1 μm LPA and increased up to 10 μmLPA (Fig. 1 C). In contrast, another PI3K product, phosphatidylinositol 3-monophosphate, was found in relative abundance in resting cells and poorly accumulated upon LPA stimulation (counts in resting, 5600 ± 1980; stimulated 2 min, 8850 ± 1280). To elucidate the mechanism of PI3K activation by LPA, we have first studied p110γ which can be directly activated by G protein subunits. The accumulation of PI3,4P2 and PIP3 upon LPA was measured in Cos cells transiently transfected with a kinase-dead mutant of p110γ (K832R) that inhibits the Gβγ-induced activation of the Ras/MAPK pathway (Fig.2 B). Expression of this mutant somewhat reduced the number of cells retrieved 2 days after transfection, leading to a small decrease of extracted lipids including PI4,5P2 (Fig. 2 A). However, upon stimulation by LPA, PIP3 levels were only moderately lowered by expression of kinase-dead p110γ, even after normalizing the results for the percentage of transfection. Thus, the inhibition on PIP3production appeared similar to the inhibitory effect on PI4,5P2. Moreover, PI3,4P2 production was not modified in Cos cells expressing the K832R p110γ mutant. In contrast, the accumulation of PI3,4P2 and PIP3 induced by 10 μm LPA was nearly abolished in Cos cells treated with genistein (Fig. 2 C), thereby suggesting the implication of p85/p110 PI3Ks. To evaluate this hypothesis, we have measured PI3K activation by LPA in Cos cells transfected with a dominant negative form of p85α lacking the p110-binding site (Δp85) (23Hara K. Yonezawa K. Sakaue H. Ando A. Kotani K. Kitamura T. Kitamura Y. Ueda H. Stephens L. Jackson T.R. Hawkins P.T. Dhand R. Clark A.E. Holman G.D. Waterfield M.D. Kasuga M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 7415-7419Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar). After normalization of the results for the percentage of transfection, we have observed that expression of Δp85 nearly abolished the accumulation of PI3,4P2 and PIP3 induced by 10 μm LPA (Fig. 2 D). In addition, we have determined whether overexpression of wild-type p110α, -β, or -γ had any potentiating effect on PI3K activation triggered by a submaximal dose of LPA (1 μm). Analysis of PI3K stimulation limited for convenience to measurements of PI3,4P2 showed that p110α and p110β to a greater extent potentiated PI3K activation by LPA, whereas overexpression of p110γ had no effect (Fig. 2 E). Altogether, these results demonstrate that the activation of PI3K by LPA is mediated by the tyrosine kinase-dependent p85/p110 isoforms of PI3K.Figure 2Activation of PI3K by LPA is independent of p110γ but involves tyrosine phosphorylations and p110/p85 isoforms. A, Cos cells were transiently transfected with a kinase-dead mutant of p110γ (K832R) or vector as a control. After serum starvation, PI3K lipid products were measured as described in Fig. 1 following a 2-min stimulation with 10 μm LPA. The results represent the percentage of inhibition of PI polyphosphate production in transfected cells normalized for the percentage of transfection, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” B, the effect of the K832R mutant on Gβγ-induced phosphorylation of hemagglutinin (HA)-tagged Erk1 was measured in Cos cells transfected with the indicated constructs (V, empty vector). C,Cos cells were labeled with [32P]H3PO4, incubated or not (control) with 100 μm genistein for 15 min, and then treated for 2 min with 10 μm LPA before analysis of PI3K lipid products. D, Cos cells were transiently transfected with a dominant negative mutant of p85 (Δp85) or vector as a control. After serum starvation, cells were stimulated 2 min with 10 μm LPA and analyzed for their content in PI3K lipid products. E, Cos cells were transfected with constructs expressing wild-type p110α, -β, and -γ or vector as indicated. The cellular contents of PI4,5P2 and PI3,4P2was determined following a 2-min stimulation with 1 μmLPA. For each transfection, the level of PI4,5P2 and PI3,4P2 in unstimulated cells has been subtracted.Inset, immunoblots of cells transfected with empty vector (−) or the various p110 (+) using their respective anti-tag antibodies.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To identify the tyrosine kinase(s) involved in this process, we have searched for major tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins in crude lysates from cells treated 2 min with LPA. The major phosphotyrosine signal induced by LPA in Vero or Cos cells was found in the 180-kDa region (Fig. 3 A), suggesting an involvement of the two major RTKs expressed in fibroblasts, i.e. the receptors for PDGF and EGF. First, we have determined that the PDGFR-specific inhibitor tyrphostin AG1296 had no effect on LPA-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of the 180-kDa protein, whereas the EGFR inhibitor AG1478 nearly abolished the signal in both Vero and Cos cells (Fig. 3 A). In addition, anti-EGFR immunoblotting of cell lysates confirmed that the 180-kDa protein colocalized with EGFR, whereas an antibody against βPDGFR gave no signal in Vero cells and a very faint band in Cos cells (Fig.3 B). Finally, following immunoprecipitation, the EGFR was found to be tyrosine-phosphorylated after treatment of Cos cells with LPA (Fig. 3 C). Thus, these data demonstrate that phosphorylation of the EGFR is the major early tyrosine phosphorylation event induced by LPA in Cos and Vero cells. We have then determined whether this event was important for PI3K recruitment by LPA. In both Cos and Vero cells, the accumulation of PI3,4P2 and PIP3 induced by LPA was dramatically inhibited by the EGFR inhibitor AG1478 (Fig.3 D). This compound also abolished the activation of Akt by LPA but did not interfere with Akt stimulation by insulin in Vero cells (not shown). In addition, AG1478 did not alter PI3K activity itself in Rat1 cells stimulated with PDGF (counts of PI3,4P2, control <200; PDGF 9255 ± 475; PDGF +AG1478 100 nm,8728 ± 836). Furthermore, Cos cells were transfected with an EGFR mutant truncated at amino acid 688 (EGFRc688) which has a strong ability to dimerize upon activation. 2K. Tanner, J. Kyte, and G. Gill, manuscript in preparation. This mutant inhibited by over 70% the LPA-induced accumulation of PI3,4P2 and PIP3 after normalizing the results for the percentage of transfection (Fig. 3 E). Although these results demonstrate that the EGFR plays a crucial role in LPA-induced PI3K activation, EGF is not a typical agonist of PI3K, and PIP3 levels are insensitive to EGF in various cell types. Nevertheless, we have observed that 10 ng/ml EGF induced an important accumulation of PI3,4P2 and PIP3 in Cos cells (Fig. 3 F). In addition, the increase in PI3K lipid products occurred earlier upon EGF stimulation (Fig. 3 F) than in the presence of LPA (Fig. 1 B), which is compatible with a recruitment of PI3K by LPA occurring downstream the EGFR. Finally, expression of Δp85 in Cos cells suppressed the synthesis of PI3K lipid products induced by EGF to an extent similar to that upon LPA stimulation (Figs. 3 G and 2 D). This suggested that both LPA and EGF use a same p85-dependent pathway to stimulate PI3,4P2 and PIP3 production. Since the activation of PI3K by EGF seems to differ from one cell type to another, we have studied various pathways possibly involved in the EGFR-dependent activation of PI3K by LPA. Using pull-down experiments with GST-p85 fusion protein, the EGFR and p85 were found to coprecipitate upon stimulation with LPA (Fig.4 A), thereby corroborating that p85 is recruited by LPA through an EGFR-dependent pathway. Although one of the major mechanisms of EGFR-mediated recruitment of p85 is the heterodimerization of the EGFR with ErbB3 (28Soltoff S.P. Carraway K.L.R. Prigent S.A. Gullick W.G. Cantley L.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 3550-3558Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar), we did not find any LPA- or EGF-induced association of ErbB3 in p85 immunoprecipitates or GST-p85 pull-downs (not shown). To identify other candidates possibly involved in recruitment of p85, we have looked for tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins in GST-p85 pull-downs and p85 immunoprecipitates from LPA- or EGF-treated cells. The major phosphotyrosine signal appearing upon stimulation was located close to the 115-kDa marker (Fig. 4 B). This molecular mass led us to consider the adaptor protein Gab1 as a candidate. By performing both p85 immunoprecipitates and GST-p85 pull-downs, Gab1 was found to associate with p85 following cell stimulation with LPA or EGF (Fig.4 B). To confirm this observation, we have performed anti-Gab1 immunoprecipitates, and p85 was found to coprecipitate with Gab1 upon stimulation with LPA or EGF (Fig. 4 C). Finally, the EGFR inhibitor AG1478 was found to abolish the association of Gab1 with p85 (Fig. 4 D). Altogether, these results demonstrate that activation of PI3K by LPA occurs through an EGFR/Gab1 pathway. To determine whether LPA could activate PI3K using other mechanisms, we have first studied IMR90 human fibroblasts where activation of MAPK by LPA is independent of RTK activities (Fig.5 A). Although LPA and PDGF stimulated Erk to similar levels in these cells, LPA produced only a minor accumulation of PI3K lipid products, whereas they readily accumulated upon treatment with PDGF (Fig. 5 A), suggesting that specific RTK transactivation is required for activation of PI3K by LPA. To determine if RTKs other than the EGFR could participate in the process, we have studied mouse B82 L fibroblasts that do not express the EGFR and where transactivation of the PDGFR is required for Erk activation by LPA (Fig. 5 B) (29Herrlich A. Daub H. Knebel A. Herrlich P. Ullrich A. Schultz G. Gudermann T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 8985-8990Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). In these cells, LPA produced only a faint accumulation of PI3K lipid products that readily accumulated upon PDGF, whereas both growth factors activated Erk to comparable levels (Fig. 5 B). Finally, in Rat1 cells where transactivation of the EGFR is required for Erk activation by LPA similarly to Vero cells (4Daub H. Weiss F.U. Wallasch C. Ullrich A. Nature. 1996; 379: 557-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (1312) Google Scholar, 29Herrlich A. Daub H. Knebel A. Herrlich P. Ullrich A. Schultz G. Gudermann T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 8985-8990Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar), we have observed that PI3,4P2 and PIP3 were hardly detectable in LPA-treated cells (Fig.6 A). As a control, PDGF induced a massive accumulation of PI3K lipid products, and both LPA and PDGF activated Erk to comparable levels. To gain insight about the missing mechanism in Rat1 cells, we have also measured PI3K activation upon stimulation with EGF. Interestingly, levels of PI3,4P2and PIP3 were not modified by EGF, although Erk activation by EGF was comparable to the PDGF response (Fig. 6 A). This suggested that the EGFR-dependent pathway of PI3K activation present in Vero and Cos cells was deficient in Rat1 cells. By using GST-p85 pull-downs assays, we have observed that Gab1 did not associate with p85 in Rat1 cells stimulated with LPA or EGF (Fig.6 B). Therefore, we have compared the recruitment of Gab1 in Cos and Rat1 cells. By immunoblotting lysates of Cos cells stimulated with EGF, Gab1 was found to undergo a shift in its apparent molecular weight that is typical of this adaptor (30Holgado-Madruga M. Emlet D.R. Moscatello D.K. Godwin A.K. Wong A.J. Nature. 1996; 379: 560-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (594) Google Scholar) (Fig. 6 C,top). In contrast, Gab1 migration was hardly modified in Rat1 cells stimulated with EGF. Similarly, following immunoprecipitation, we have found that Gab1 was not tyrosine-phosphorylated, and its migration was unchanged in LPA- or EGF-treated Rat1 cells (Fig. 6 C, bottom).

Both isozymes are integral membrane proteins but lack transmembrane domains. X-ray crystallographic studies have led to the hypothesis that PGHS-1 and -2 associate with only one face of the membrane bilayer through a novel, monotopic membrane binding domain (MBD) that is comprised of four short, consecutive, amphipathic α-helices (helices A–D) that include residues 74–122 in ovine PGHS-1 (oPGHS-1) and residues 59–108 in human PGHS-2 (hPGHS-2). Previous biochemical studies from our laboratory showed that the MBD of oPGHS-1 lies somewhere between amino acids 25 and 166. In studies reported here, membrane-associated forms of oPGHS-1 and hPGHS-2 were labeled using the hydrophobic, photoactivable reagent 3-trifluoro-3-(m-[125I]iodophenyl)diazirine, isolated, and cleaved with AspN and/or GluC, and the photolabeled peptides were sequenced. The results establish that the MBDs of oPGHS-1 and hPGHS-2 reside within residues 74–140 and 59–111, respectively, and thus provide direct provide biochemical support for the hypothesis that PGHS-1 and -2 do associate with membranes through a monotopic MBD. We also prepared HelA, HelB, and HelC mutants of oPGHS-1, in which, for each helix, three or four hydrophobic residues expected to protrude into the membrane were replaced with small, neutral residues. When expressed in COS-1 cells, HelA and HelC mutants exhibited little or no catalytic activity and were present, at least in part, as misfolded aggregates. The HelB mutant retained about 20% of the cyclooxygenase activity of native oPGHS-1 and partitioned in subcellular fractions like native oPGHS-1; however, the HelB mutant exhibited an extra site of N-glycosylation at Asn104. When this glycosylation site was eliminated (HelB/N104Q mutation), the mutant lacked cyclooxygenase activity. Thus, our mutational analyses indicate that the amphipathic character of each helix is important for the assembly and folding of oPGHS-1 to a cyclooxygenase active form.

The MBD of PGHSs contain four short, consecutive, amphipathic α-helices (labeled A–D in Fig. 1 A). Hydrophobic and aromatic residues protrude from these helices and away from the hydrophilic surface of the catalytic domain to create a hydrophobic patch predicted to facilitate interaction with an underlying lipid layer. These helices also surround an opening through which fatty acid substrates are believed to enter the cyclooxygenase active site.It is important to our understanding of PGHS biology and the structural biology of membrane proteins in general to understand how PGHS-1 and -2 interact with cellular membranes. In this report, we describe experiments designed to identify and characterize biochemically the regions of PGHS-1 and PGHS-2 that interact with cellular membranes by using a combination of photoaffinity labeling with 3-trifluoro-3-(m-[125I]iodophenyl)diazirine ([125I]TID) (28Brunner J. Semenza G. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 7174-7182Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar) and mutagenic analyses of the α-helices proposed to be involved in membrane binding.RESULTS[125I]TID is a hydrophobic molecule that partitions into membranes and upon photoactivation yields a carbene that, in turn, reacts nonspecifically with both lipid and protein constituents of the membranes (28Brunner J. Semenza G. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 7174-7182Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Previous studies using [125I]TID labeling of oPGHS-1 in ovine seminal vesicle microsomes had established that the radiolabel was incorporated into a 20.5-kDa peptide that included residues 25–166 (30Otto J.C. Smith W.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9906-9910Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The putative membrane binding domains of oPGHS-1 and hPGHS-2 are predicted to include residues 74–122 and 59–108, respectively (Fig. 1 B). Accordingly, our experiments were designed to determine if a peptide containing only these residues could be photolabeled with [125I]TID.Photolabeling of the oPGHS-1 Membrane Binding DomainOvine seminal vesicle microsomes containing oPGHS-1 were preincubated with flurbiprofen and photolabeled with [125I]TID, and, as expected (30Otto J.C. Smith W.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9906-9910Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), oPGHS-1 was the major [125I]TID-labeled membrane protein (data not shown). SDS-PAGE of [125I]TID-labeled oPGHS-1 immunoprecipitated from solubilized microsomes revealed a single radioactive band (Fig.2 A) that was recognized, upon Western transfer blotting, by an oPGHS-1-specific antibody (Fig.2 B). Analysis of the primary structure of oPGHS-1 predicts that cleavage of the enzyme with endoproteinase GluC will yield an 8-kDa peptide containing amino acids 74–140 (Fig. 1 B). Accordingly, [125I]TID-labeled, immunoprecipitated oPGHS-1 was denatured in guanidinium hydrochloride and subjected to exhaustive proteolysis with endoproteinase GluC. Separation of the GluC proteolysis products by SDS-PAGE, transfer to PVDF membranes, and subsequent autoradiography revealed an 8-kDa, [125I]TID-labeled peptide (Fig. 2 A). A small amount of a radiolabeled 14-kDa peptide was found that was recognized by an antibody directed against amino acids 25–35 (Fig.2 B); the 14-kDa peptide probably represents incompletely digested oPGHS-1 containing residues 25–140. We attempted to confirm the identity of the 8-kDa photoaffinity-labeled peptide from Fig.2 A by N-terminal sequence analysis. Unfortunately, this was unsuccessful because the sequencing background was unacceptably high, apparently because of contaminating peptides derived from GluC-digested IgG molecules used to immunoprecipitate the oPGHS-1.Figure 2[125I]TID labeling of oPGHS-1 and hPGHS-2 and peptides derived from their proteolytic cleavage. oPGHS-1 and hPGHS-2 were labeled with [125I]TID, purified, and digested with GluC or AspN as indicated and as detailed under “Experimental Procedures.” Proteolytic products were separated by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by autoradiography and immunoblotting.

TheK m, V max, and subcellular localization of His-tagged hPGHS-2 were indistinguishable from those of the native enzyme, suggesting that the His-tagged hPGHS-2 is folded and associated with membranes in a native fashion.2 To determine which regions of hPGHS-2 were associated with the endoplasmic reticulum, microsomal membranes from Sf21 cells expressing His-tagged hPGHS-2 were prepared and photoaffinity-labeled with [125I]TID. Analysis of the purified hPGHS-2 by SDS-PAGE revealed a single [125I]TID-labeled band at the expected molecular mass, 70–72 kDa (Fig. 2 C). This protein band was reactive with an antibody directed against the N terminus of hPGHS-2 (Fig. 2 D).The primary structure of PGHS-2 predicts that treatment with endoproteinase GluC will yield proteolytic products that include an 8-kDa fragment containing amino acids 59–126 (Fig. 1 B). This region includes the predicted membrane binding domain with amino acids 59–108. Exhaustive proteolysis of [125I]TID-labeled hPGHS-2 with endoproteinase GluC followed by autoradiography revealed a single radioactive peptide of 8 kDa (Fig. 2 C). The 8-kDa fragment was not recognized by antibodies directed against amino acids 20–40 of hPGHS-2 (Fig.2 D). These observations suggested that the membrane binding domain of hPGHS-2 lies between residues 59 and 126. To confirm this, the 8-kDa [125I]TID-labeled peptide from Fig.2 C was excised from the PVDF membrane and subjected to 15 rounds of N-terminal sequence analysis. The N-terminal sequence of this peptide was FLTRIKLFLKPTPNT, which corresponds to amino acids 59–73. Thus, the 8-kDa radioactive peptide containing the [125I]TID-labeled portion of hPGHS-2 consists of amino acids 59–126. This region contains the corresponding four amphipathic α-helices predicted to serve as the membrane binding domain of hPGHS-2 (16Luong C. Miller A. Barnett J. Chow J. Ramesha C. Browner M.F. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 927-933Crossref PubMed Scopus (554) Google Scholar).Further mapping of the membrane-associated portion of hPGHS-2 was accomplished by exhaustive digestion of [125I]TID-labeled hPGHS-2 with endoproteinase AspN (Fig. 1 B). AspN treatment of hPGHS-2 resulted in a single radioactive band of approximately 6.2 kDa (Fig. 2 E). This radiolabeled peptide was smaller than the 8-kDa, radiolabeled GluC product and was of a size similar to that of the four-helix hPGHS-2 membrane binding domain containing amino acids 59–109. N-terminal sequence analysis of the radioactive AspN product identified three peptides, one including residues 59–111 of hPGHS-2 (6.2 kDa), another corresponding to residues 384–428 of hPGHS-2 (6.1 kDa), and an unknown trace contaminant. The hPGHS-2 fragment consisting of amino acids 59–111 apparently resulted from promiscuous cleavage of the protein by AspN at Glu58 and Asp111; AspN has been reported to cleave proteins at Glu residues under normal proteolytic conditions (38Ingrosso D. Fowler A.V. Bleibaum J. Clarke S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1989; 162: 1528-1534Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 39Tetaz T. Morrison J.R. Andreou J. Fidge N.H. Biochem. Int. 1990; 22: 561-566PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, AspN peptide mapping provided further evidence consistent with an hPGHS-2 membrane binding domain involving amino acids 59–109.Mutations in the Membrane Binding Domain of oPGHS-1To begin examining the role of hydrophobic amino acids within the membrane binding domain, three different sets of mutations were introduced into helices A–C, respectively, of oPGHS-1 (Figs. 1 and3). Hydrophobic residues oriented away from the body of the enzyme and expected to interdigitate with the membrane lipids were replaced by smaller neutral or hydrophilic side chains. The mutants were designated HelA (I74T/W75S/W77S/L78T), HelB (F88S/F91S/L92A), and HelC (W98S/L99A/F102S). Helix D was not altered, because this latter helix is part of the hydrophobic channel involved in binding arachidonic acid, and mutations in this region were expected to yield inactive enzyme (36Rieke C.J. Mulichak A.M. Garavito R.M. Smith W.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17109-17114Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 40Bhattacharyya D.K. Lecomte M. Rieke C.J. Garavito R.M. Smith W.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2179-2184Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Each of the mutant proteins was expressed in COS-1 cells. As summarized in TableI, enzymatic assays of microsomal membranes prepared from the cells revealed that the HelB mutant protein retained approximately 20% of the native cyclooxygenase and peroxidase activities, and HelC retained very low, but detectable levels of activity (∼1% of native enzyme) measured by radio thin layer chromatography (not shown), while the HelA mutant was catalytically inactive. The electrophoretic mobilities of the HelA, HelB, and HelC mutants were examined by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 3 A). Interestingly, the HelB and HelC mutants exhibited a 74-kDa band in addition to the native 72-kDa band. Native oPGHS-1 is glycosylated at three of four consensus N-glycosylation sites (Asn68, Asn144, and Asn410) and has an observed molecular mass of 72 kDa (29Otto J.C. DeWitt D.L. Smith W.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 18234-18242Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The 74-kDa bands seen for HelB and HelC mutants appear to result from an additional N-glycosylation at a consensus N-glycosylation site at Asn104located in helix C of the membrane binding domain that in native oPGHS-1 is not glycosylated. Consistent with this is the finding that treatment of each of the three mutant proteins with endoglycosidase H reduced their molecular masses to 66 kDa (Fig. 3 A). Additionally, another HelB mutant was prepared and designated HelB/N104Q; this mutant exhibited a 72-kDa but not a 74-kDa band on SDS-PAGE (Fig. 3 B). The HelB/N104Q mutant lacked cyclooxygenase activity but exhibited a low level of peroxidase activity. In contrast, N104Q oPGHS-1 retains 45–50% of both peroxidase and cyclooxygenase activities of native oPGHS-1 (29Otto J.C. DeWitt D.L. Smith W.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 18234-18242Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Our results suggest that the additional N-glycosylation occurring In the HelB mutant partially compensates for a complete loss of cyclooxygenase activity induced by mutations in residues in helix B, which are expected to protrude into the membrane.Figure 3Western blot analysis of ovine PGHS-1 helix mutant proteins.

Open table in a new tab Native PGHS-1 is normally associated with the membrane pellets derived from centrifugation at 10,000 × g and 200,000 ×g (10P and 200P). To determine if mutations in the membrane binding domain of oPGHS-1 were sufficient to disrupt its association with membranes, COS-1 cells expressing native oPGHS-1 or HelA, HelB, or HelC mutants were homogenized and subjected to differential centrifugation (Fig. 3 C). All three mutant proteins were equally distributed between the 10P and 200P fractions. No immunoreactive reactive material was observed in the 200S supernatant fraction from native or mutant oPGHS-1. Thus, mutations in the individual helices A, B, and C are insufficient to solubilize PGHS-1 from cellular membranes. The distribution of cyclooxygenase activity for the HelB mutant between the 10P, 200P, and 200S fractions (43, 57, and 0%, respectively) following differential centrifugation was similar to that seen for native oPGHS-1.The lack of enzymatic activity in the HelA protein and the low activity of the HelC protein raised the possibility that these mutant proteins were not retaining native structure and were mostly present as unfolded aggregates that precipitated with membrane fractions. We examined this possibility by determining the ability of each mutant protein to be solubilized by detergents. Treatment of microsomes from COS-1 cells expressing native PGHS-1, HelA, HelB, or HelC with 1% Tween 20 indicated that greater percentages of native PGHS-1 and HelB (66 and 50%, respectively) were solubilized from membranes as compared with HelA and HelC (38 and 32%, respectively) (Fig.4 A). To further explore this apparent difference in the solubility of the mutant proteins, we expressed HelA, HelB, and a double mutant (HelAB) in COS-1 cells and incubated nuclei isolated from these cells in the presence or absence of various detergents (Fig. 4 B). Regardless of the detergent used for solubilization, HelA and HelAB were always more difficult to solubilize from membranes than HelB, which displayed a solubilization pattern similar to that of the native enzyme. These observations suggest that a significant portion of HelA and HelC is present as unfolded aggregates when overexpressed in COS-1 cells.Figure 4Detergent solubilization of oPGHS-1 helix mutants.

We studied the influences of two pathophysiological stimuli, native (unmodified) and oxidized low density lipoprotein, on tissue factor gene expression in a cell important in vascular remodeling and vascular diseases, the smooth muscle cell. Our results demonstrated that both lipoproteins significantly induced tissue factor gene expression in rat aortic smooth muscle cells; oxidized low density lipoprotein was slightly more potent. Both lipoproteins increased tissue factor mRNA in a concentration- and time-dependent manner. Results from nuclear run-on assays and mRNA stability experiments indicated that increased tissue factor mRNA accumulation in response to the lipoproteins was principally controlled at the transcriptional level. By using lipid extracts of low density lipoprotein or methylation of the intact lipoprotein to block receptor recognition, we showed that this lipoprotein induced tissue factor mRNA via both receptor-independent and receptor-augmented pathways. Transfection studies using a series of deleted tissue factor promoters revealed that a −143- to +106-base pair region of the rat tissue factor promoter contained regulatory elements required for lipoprotein-mediated induction. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays showed that the binding activities of the transcription factor Egr-1, but not Sp1, were markedly elevated in response to these lipoproteins. Transfection of site-directed mutants of the tissue factor (TF) promoter demonstrated that not only Egr-1 but also Sp1 cis-acting elements in the TF (−143) promoter construct were necessary for optimal TF gene induction. Our data show for the first time that both low density lipoprotein and oxidized low density lipoprotein induce tissue factor gene expression in smooth muscle cells and that this tissue factor gene expression is mediated by both Egr-1 and Sp1 transcription factors.

It is important to understand how TF is regulated in SMC, since TF in advancing lesions could exacerbate coagulation after injury, promote SMC proliferation via thrombin generation (8McNamara C.A.

We have recently observed that low density lipoprotein (LDL), the levels of which correlate with vascular disease, enhance TF mRNA and TF surface protein in human and rat SMC (17Penn M.S. Patel C.V. Cui M.Z. DiCorleto P.E. Chisolm G.M. Circulation. 1999; 99: 1753-1759Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The mechanism is unknown, however, by which LDL or oxidized low density lipoprotein (oxLDL), a modified form of LDL accumulating in vascular lesions, influences TF gene expression in these cells. In vivo, plasma LDL contacts endothelium from its luminal aspect, and interstitial LDL and oxLDL surround SMC and monocyte/macrophages of the intima in developing arterial lesions. Efforts have been made to examine the effects of lipoproteins on TF expression in cells present in vascular lesions other than SMC. OxLDL, but not LDL, was shown to induce tissue factor in endothelial cells (18Drake T.A. Hannani K. Fei H.H. Lavi S. Berliner J.A. Am. J. Pathol. 1991; 138: 601-607PubMed Google Scholar, 19Weis J.R. Pitas R.E. Wilson B.D. Rodgers G.M. FASEB J. 1991; 5: 2459-2465Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). There are also reports of lipoprotein effects on macrophage or monocyte TF, but these are somewhat contradictory (20Lewis J.C. Bennett-Cain A.L. DeMars C.S. Doellgast G.J. Grant K.W. Jones N.L.

We have found that in rabbit, human, and rat SMC, oxLDL increased cell surface TF activity markedly, whereas native LDL had little effect on TF activity (23Penn M.S. DiCorleto P.E. Chisolm G.M. Circulation. 1994; 90 (abstr.): I-353Crossref Scopus (110) Google Scholar). 2M.-Z. Cui, M. S. Penn, and G. M. Chisolm, unpublished data. In the present study, we report that both LDL and oxLDL significantly induce TF gene expression in cultured rat aortic SMC. Our data also reveal a part of the molecular mechanisms underlying the lipoprotein-induced TF gene expression. Human LDL between the solvent density limits of 1.019 and 1.063 g/ml was isolated from citrated plasma using sequential ultracentrifugation as described previously (24Morel D.W. Hessler J.R. Chisolm G.M. J. Lipid Res. 1983; 24: 1070-1076Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To inhibit oxidative modification, 0.5 mmEDTA was present throughout the isolation procedure. LDL preparations were stored in 0.5 mm EDTA at 4 °C in the dark prior to use in experiments. LDL preparations were used less than 2 weeks after isolation. LDL was oxidized by dialysis against 5 μmferrous sulfate in 0.15 m NaCl for 23–26 h at room temperature. After oxidation, preparations were dialyzed against 0.15m NaCl, 0.5 mm EDTA, pH 8.5, to remove Fe2+. The quality of all preparations of LDL and selected preparations of oxLDL was checked for endotoxin level using BioWhittaker kit (QCL 1000). The average endotoxin level for all LDL preparations used was 0.00174 ± 0.00236 pg/μg LDL protein (n = 43). The range of the endotoxin level of all preparations was 0.000 to 0.013 pg/μg. Electrophoretic mobility (Corning) and thiobarbituric acid reactivity (25Schuh J. Fairclough Jr., G.F. Haschemeyer R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Thiobarbituric acid reactivities for LDL were 0.1 to 0.9 nmol of malondialdehyde (as standard)/mg LDL cholesterol, and for oxLDL were 3.9 to 8.1. Commercial lipopolysaccharide (LPS, Escherichia coli 0111: B4 from Calbiochem) was used as a positive control in the LPS assay and was also used in experiments testing the possible role of LPS in lipoprotein induction of TF in SMC. Lipoprotein preparations were analyzed for protein (27Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and cholesterol (Sigma cholesterol assay kit catalog 352-20, using Sigma cholesterol standards catalog number C0534); LDL and oxLDL concentrations are expressed as μg (protein)/ml, except where specifically indicated. Extraction of LDL lipids was by methods used by us previously (28Coffey M.D. Cole R.A. Colles S.M. Chisolm G.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 1866-1873Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), and the lipid concentration of the extract was indexed by total cholesterol content. Methylation of LDL has been well documented to block LDL receptor recognition (29Lund-Katz S. Ibdah J.A. Letizia J.Y. Thomas M.T. Phillips M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 13831-13838Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). LDL (2–10 mg of protein/ml) in 30 mm sodium borate buffer, pH 8.5–9.0, was methylated by adding formaldehyde (1 μl of 37% w/v formaldehyde per 10 mg of protein LDL every 6 min for 30 min at 4 °C) as described previously (30Weisgraber K.H. Innerarity T.L. Mahley R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 9053-9062Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Methylation was terminated by dialysis at 4 °C against 0.15 m NaCl, 0.5 mm EDTA. Methylation level was measured using trinitrobenzene-sulfonic acid to quantify altered lysine residues (31Fields R. Methods Enzymol. 1972; 25: 464-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar). SMC were prepared from explants of excised aortas of rats as described previously (32Brock T.A. Alexander R.W. Ekstein L.S. Atkinson W.J. Gimbrone Jr., M.A. Hypertension. 1985; 7: 105-109Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). SMC between passages 4 and 14 were used in these studies. Cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum. Cells were made quiescent by incubation in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium for 48 h prior to the addition of LDL, oxLDL, or other agonists as described previously (17Penn M.S.

Total cellular RNA was isolated by using TRIzol reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Total RNA (6–8 μg) was subjected to denaturing electrophoresis in formaldehyde/agarose gels. RNA was blotted onto GeneScreen (NEN Life Science Products) membranes and hybridized with radiolabeled cDNA probes (34Virca G.D. Northemann W. Shiels B.R. Widera G. Broome S.

The α-tubulin gene was used as an internal control, and pBluescript II SK (Stratagene) was used to assess transcript background since rat TF cDNA was inserted in this vector. Following 1 h of lipoprotein stimulation or control (untreated) incubation, actinomycin D (Sigma) was added to achieve a concentration of 10 μg/ml. Cells were washed once with phosphate-buffered saline at the stated times and immediately lysed with TRIzol reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.) for RNA isolation. After Northern analysis, densitometric measurements were made, and the relative density (normalized by the density at the time of actinomycin D addition and the amount of GAPDH) was fit to a single exponential, reflecting first-order kinetics for mRNA degradation. Half-lives for the relative mRNA degradation were calculated from the best fit equation for each treatment. Nuclear extracts were prepared from 1 × 107 cells as described previously (37Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9160) Google Scholar). Protein concentrations of the nuclear extracts were 0.5–4 μg/μl, as measured using a protein assay dye reagent (Bio-Rad). Oligonucleotides containing four rat TF promoter regions (regions 1–4) were chosen and obtained from Operon Technologies (Alameda, CA). Electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA) were performed as described previously (14Cui M.Z. Parry G.C. Oeth P. Larson H. Smith M. Huang R.P. Adamson E.D. Mackman N. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2731-2739Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Oligonucleotides of consensus or mutant Egr-1, Sp1, and a serum response element (SRE) obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology were used in the competition assays in EMSA. Consensus Egr-1, Sp1, or SRE sites are bold, and the underlined regions indicate the mutant bases (for Egr-1, GG → TA, for Sp1 GG → TT): 5′-GGA TCC AGCGGGGGCG AGCGGGGGCG A-3′ (Egr-1), 5′-ATT CGA TCGGGGCGGGGC GAG C-3′ (Sp1) and 5′-GGA TGT CCATATTAGG AC ATC-3′ (SRE). For antibody supershift experiments, 2 μg of a rabbit antipeptide antibody to Egr-1 or Sp1 was incubated with the nuclear extracts in the binding mixture for 20 min at room temperature prior to the addition of the radiolabeled oligonucleotide. Anti-Egr-1 (sc-110x) and anti-Sp1 (sc-59x) rabbit polyclonal antibodies were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Based on the published sequence of the 5′-flanking region of the rat TF gene (38Taby O. Rosenfield C.L. Bogdanov V. Nemerson Y. Taubman M.B. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1996; 76: 697-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), we synthesized several primers, which were used for amplification of regions of the promoter. A 660-bp region upstream of the transcription site, as well as several shorter fragments were amplified using rat genomic DNA and cloned into the luciferase reporter plasmid pXP2 (39Nordeen S.K. BioTechniques. 1988; 6: 454-458PubMed Google Scholar). Constructs TF(−258), TF(−182), and TF(−79) were generously provided by Dr. Taubman. Mutations in the Egr-1 and/or Sp1 sites were generated by PCR. The sequences of wild-type TF (−143) and the four plasmids containing mutations in the Egr-1 and/or Sp1 sequences are shown under “Results.” All plasmids were sequenced to confirm base pair substitutions. (Our sequence data revealed a G instead of an A at −74 bp in the TF promoter as reported (38Taby O. Rosenfield C.L. Bogdanov V. Nemerson Y. Taubman M.B. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1996; 76: 697-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar)). SMC were plated at 3 × 105 cells/60-mm dish 24 h prior to transfections. Cells were transfected with 3.5 μg of TF reporter construct using the SuperFect reagent from Qiagen in accordance with the manufacturer's recommendations. Transfected cells were incubated in serum-free medium for 48 h before a 4-h induction with either LDL or oxLDL. Luciferase activity was determined using the Luciferase Assay System (Promega) and ML2250 luminometer (Dynatech). pSV-β-Gal DNA (0.4 μg) (Promega) was used as an internal control to assess transfection efficiencies. β-Galactosidase activity was measured using LumiGal 530 Assay Reagent (Lumigen). Previously we reported that in SMC, cell surface TF activity was dramatically increased by oxLDL but not appreciably increased by LDL (23Penn M.S. DiCorleto P.E. Chisolm G.M. Circulation. 1994; 90 (abstr.): I-353Crossref Scopus (110) Google Scholar); however, LDL increased TF mRNA (17Penn M.S. Patel C.V. Cui M.Z. DiCorleto P.E. Chisolm G.M. Circulation. 1999; 99: 1753-1759Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). In the present study, we asked whether increased TF activity by oxLDL and increased mRNA by LDL were related to the induction of TF gene expression. Quiescent rat aortic SMC contained low levels of TF mRNA. We found both LDL and oxLDL significantly increased TF mRNA accumulation. The dependence of the enhanced mRNA levels on oxLDL concentration is shown in Fig.1. For both LDL and oxLDL, maximum responses were observed at about 200 μg/ml. We have tested over 30 different isolates of LDL and all significantly increased TF mRNA levels. Whereas both LDL and oxLDL are capable of inducing TF gene expression, when matched for lipoprotein (protein) concentration, oxLDL was generally capable of inducing TF gene expression more strongly. (From densitometric assays of Northern analyses, oxLDL stimulation exceeded that of LDL by an average of 38%, n = 8 pairs of LDL and oxLDL data; p ≤ 0.003 by pairedt test.) When human aortic SMC were used, the induction of TF mRNA by LDL or oxLDL was also observed (data not shown), suggesting that the response applies to multiple species. Maximum levels of TF mRNA were observed about 90 min after either LDL or oxLDL stimulation (Fig.2). The increased accumulation of TF mRNA induced by LDL or oxLDL was transient and declined significantly between 2 and 7 h. The time courses of the TF mRNA inductions are similar to those induced by serum and growth factors in HeLa cells and SMC (13Cui M.Z. Parry G.C. Edgington T.S. Mackman N. Arterioscler. Thromb. 1994; 14: 807-814Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 40Taubman M.B. Am. J. Cardiol. 1993; 72: 55-60Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar); however, the magnitude of the response to lipoproteins was less than that to serum (data not shown). We and others (41Morel D.W. DiCorleto P.E. Chisolm G.M. Lab. Invest. 1986; 55: 419-426PubMed Google Scholar, 42Victorov A.V. Medvedeva N.V. Gladkaya E.M. Morozkin A.D. Podrez E.A. Kosykh V.A. Yurkiv V.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 984: 119-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) have reported that LPS can bind to LDL and be delivered to cells via LDL. As a result, we exercise special precautions during the preparation of LDL and oxLDL to avoid LPS contamination. We examined whether the trace amounts of LPS typically measurable on LDL could be contributing to the induction of TF by LDL in SMC. We tested whether these trace amounts of LPS alone can induce TF mRNA, and we tested whether LPS could augment LDL induction of TF gene expression. One pg/ml of LPS alone, which is 2.9-fold above the average amount present in 200 μg/ml LDL, did not increase the TF mRNA level. At LPS levels above 10 ng/ml (29,000 times the average amount present in 200 μg/ml LDL), the induction of TF mRNA was detectable. Importantly, even very high levels of LPS (1 μg/ml) did not synergistically enhance LDL induction of TF mRNA (data not shown), indicating that trace contamination by LPS did not contribute to the TF gene regulation by LDL and suggesting that the signaling pathways of induction of TF gene expression by lipoproteins and LPS are distinct in SMC. An increase in TF mRNA level detected by Northern blot analysis can be due to an increase in the rate of transcription, stabilization of previously transcribed mRNAs, or a combination of both mechanisms. TF mRNA is known to have a destabilizing region containing four copies of an AUUUA motif (43Morrissey J.H. Fakhrai H. Edgington T.S. Cell. 1987; 50: 129-135Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). To investigate whether LDL and oxLDL stimulation can modify post-transcriptional mechanisms to stabilize TF mRNA and thus enhance message levels in SMC, we examined TF mRNA stability in cells that were untreated or treated for 1 h with LDL or oxLDL. The cells received 10 μg/ml actinomycin D to stop transcription. We separately determined that TF transcription was completely arrested at this concentration (data not shown). As expected, compared with the untreated group, a 1-h stimulation with LDL or oxLDL significantly increased TF mRNA levels (6- and 10-fold, respectively); however, the treatment with LDL or oxLDL did not markedly affect the TF mRNA degradation rate after arresting transcription, as shown in Fig. 3 for one experiment. The half-lives of the TF mRNA in untreated, LDL-treated or oxLDL-treated cells, calculated using data from two experiments, were 107, 88, and 88 min, respectively. Therefore, treatment of cells with LDL or oxLDL did not stabilize TF mRNA. The fact that the LDL and oxLDL could markedly increase TF mRNA without a stabilizing effect on TF mRNA suggested that LDL and oxLDL regulate TF gene expression at the transcriptional level. To assess this possibility further, nuclear transcription run-on assays were performed at 40 and 60 min following LDL and oxLDL stimulation. In unstimulated cells, there was a low basal rate of transcription of the TF gene, consistent with the low levels of TF mRNA observed in Fig. 1. This basal rate of transcription was increased 7.6- and 11.4-fold after 40 min of exposure to LDL and oxLDL, respectively, or 6.2- and 13.4-fold after 1 h exposure to LDL and oxLDL, respectively (Fig. 4). These data, together with the mRNA stability results, demonstrated that the LDL- and oxLDL-induced increases in TF mRNA were controlled at the transcriptional level. We tested whether LDL lipids in the absence of the apolipoprotein B (apoB) moiety could induce TF mRNA levels. As shown in Fig. 5, 200 μg of cholesterol/ml of the total lipids extracted from LDL was able to increase the TF mRNA level, although only to about half the level induced by intact LDL at 200 μg of cholesterol/ml. In another approach, LDL was methylated to the extent that 38% of the lysine residues of apoB were blocked, a level shown by others to be sufficient to prevent LDL receptor recognition. (Methylation of 20% or more lysine residues of LDL will reduce binding to the receptor to negligible levels (29Lund-Katz S. Ibdah J.A. Letizia J.Y. Thomas M.T. Phillips M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 13831-13838Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 30Weisgraber K.H. Innerarity T.L. Mahley R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 9053-9062Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).) Methylated LDL also significantly increased TF mRNA accumulation but to only about half the level of LDL (see Fig. 5). These data indicate that LDL lipids contain at least part of the TF inducing activity of LDL, and they also suggest that a LDL receptor-dependent pathway is not required for TF induction by LDL but can enhance the induction. To determine the LDL and oxLDL primary response regions in the TF promoter, and examine whether NF-κB and AP-1 sites possibly play a role in regulation of TF gene expression in SMC, we conducted a series of transfection studies. According to the published rat TF promoter sequence, we synthesized a set of oligonucleotides as primers to clone a series of TF promoter regions with selected deletions by PCR techniques using the rat genomic DNA. Lipoprotein responsiveness of the promoter region of the TF gene was evaluated by transiently transfecting rat aortic SMC with the deleted TF promoter constructs and subsequently treating these cells with 200 μg/ml either LDL or oxLDL for 4 h. In Fig.6, the left panel shows the deleted rat TF promoters and the right panel summarizes the fold induction of the luciferase activities corresponding to each promoter construct analyzed. The data show that the deletion from −660 bp to −143 bp did not reduce the induction increased by either LDL (3.5–4.1-fold) or oxLDL (4.6–4.9-fold), indicating that the two AP1 sites and one NF-κB site, as well as the Sp1 site located at −163 bp, did not participate in the mediation of the lipoprotein-induced TF mRNA increase. The further deletion from −143 to −109 reduced the fold induction from 4.1 to 2.6 for LDL and 4.9 to 2.9 for oxLDL. The deletion from −109 to −99 did not affect the induction further; however, the deletion of the Sp1 site from TF (−109) further reduced the fold induction from 2.6 to 1.4 and 2.9 to 2.0 for LDL and oxLDL, respectively. These transfection data indicate that the responsive region mediating LDL and oxLDL induction is located in the TF (−143) promoter construct. To define which transcription factors regulate TF gene expression and the precisecis-acting elements in the TF (−143) promoter region mediating the lipoprotein induction, we first examined whether binding activities of transcription factors to the −143-bp TF promoter were induced in response to LDL and oxLDL by performing EMSA. Protein-DNA complexes were identified by incubating nuclear extracts from untreated and LDL- or oxLDL-stimulated SMC (1 h) with radiolabeled oligonucleotides (regions 1–4, defined in Fig.7 A). As shown in Fig.7 B, upon LDL or oxLDL stimulation (1 h), an inducible complex (II) was formed when region 3 was used as a radiolabeled probe. Complexes I and III were constitutively present in untreated and treated cells. There were no detectable changes induced by LDL or oxLDL compared with the untreated cells when radiolabeled regions 1, 2, and 4 were used as probes (Fig. 7 B). Therefore, we chose radiolabeled region 3 as a probe in the following EMSA experiments to determine whether the binding of nuclear proteins to the TF promoter region was specific and to elucidate which transcription factor binding activity was increased in response to lipoproteins. A 50-fold molar excess of unlabeled region 3 completely blocked the formation of complexes I, II, and III (lanes 4–6 of Fig. 7 C), indicating the binding is specific. We also employed consensus and mutated Egr-1 and Sp1 sites as competitors, since Egr-1- and Sp1-binding sites were observed in region 3"

In comparison with rH1, wild-type rIIA α subunits are characterized by more positive voltage-dependent activation and inactivation, a more prominent slow gating mode, and a more substantial shift to the fast gating mode upon coexpression of β1 subunits inXenopus oocytes. When α subunits were expressed alone, chimeras with substitutions from rH1 in five extracellular loops (IIS5-SS1, IISS2-S6, IIIS1-S2, IIISS2-S6, and IVS3-S4) had negatively shifted activation, and chimeras with substitutions in three of these (IISS2-S6, IIIS1-S2, and IVS3-S4) also had negatively shifted steady-state inactivation. rIIA α subunit chimeras with substitutions from rH1 in five extracellular loops (IS5-SS1, ISS2-S6, IISS2-S6, IIIS1-S2, and IVS3-S4) favored the fast gating mode.

The major form of the sodium channel in rat brain is a heterotrimeric complex of an α subunit (260 kDa), a noncovalently bound β1 subunit (36 kDa), and a disulfide-linked β2 subunit (33 kDa) (1Catterall W.A.

Extensive structure-function analyses of α subunits have shown that the S4 transmembrane segments in each domain serve as voltage sensors for channel activation; the S5 and S6 segments and the pore loop between them form the transmembrane pore; and the short, highly conserved intracellular loop between domains III and IV forms the inactivation gate (reviewed in Refs. 10Catterall W.A.

Hanck D.A. Physiol. Rev. 1996; 76: 887-926Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). In this study, we have analyzed the functional properties and the modulation by the β1 subunit of chimeras constructed between rat brain type IIA (rIIA)1 and rat heart (rH1) sodium channel α subunits to reveal functional activities of the extracellular loops of the α subunit and to identify specific extracellular segments that are important determinants of voltage-dependent gating and interaction with the β1 subunit. Five M13 constructs collectively spanning nearly the entire rIIA sequence were used as templates for site-directed mutagenesis. The template mp18SSNC (nucleotides 1898–2700) contains the SmaI/SphI rIIA fragment. The template mp19BstNC was created by first introducing a BstEII site in the mp19 vector and then subcloning theSphI/BstEII rIIA fragment (nucleotides 2701–4636). The remaining three templates, mp18KXNC (nucleotides 23–540), mp19XaI (nucleotides 541–1897), and mp18RVNC (nucleotides 4279–5997) have been described (13Rogers J.C. Qu Y. Tanada T.N. Scheuer T.

Of the 16 extracellular loops, one loop is identical between the rIIA and rH1 isoforms (IS3-S4), and 12 of the remaining loops were short enough to use oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis to directly introduce the rIIA-to-rH1 amino acid changes, using uracil-containing templates and the dut−ung− selection procedure (20Kunkel T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 488-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (4880) Google Scholar). The three remaining large loop chimeras (IS5-SS1, IIIS5-SS1, and IVSS2-S6) were created by using oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis to delete the sequence encoding each loop while simultaneously introducing silent restriction sites flanking these individual regions. Cardiac-specific primers containing the flanking restriction sites were then used to amplify the sequence encoding each corresponding loop from rH1 cDNA for cloning into the appropriate region of rIIA, as described previously (13Rogers J.C.

Fragments containing mutations were then excised from these mutagenesis templates and cloned into pCDM8SalK-NC or pCDM8Sal-NC. All mutations were confirmed in the final constructs by DNA sequencing and extensive restriction mapping. pCDM8 plasmids encoding WT and chimeric sodium channel α subunits were linearized withClaI, and plasmids encoding β1 subunits were linearized with HindIII. Transcription was performed with T7 RNA polymerase (Ambion Inc., Austin, TX). Isolation, preparation, and maintenance of Xenopus oocytes were carried out as described previously (21McPhee J.C.

Healthy oocytes selected manually were pressure-injected with 50 nl of a solution containing either a 1:4 or 1:1 molar ratio of α to β1 subunit RNA. Electrophysiological recordings were carried out 2–5 days after injection. Two-electrode voltage-clamp experiments were performed as described previously (22Qu Y. Isom L.L. Westenbroek R.E.

The amplitude of expressed sodium currents was typically 0.5–5 μA. The voltage-clamp protocols are described in the figure legends. Conductance-voltage (g-V) relationships were derived from current-voltage (I-V) relationships according to g = I/(V −V r ), where I is the peak current amplitude measured at voltage V and the reversal potentialV r is assumed to be +55 mV under our recording conditions. Normalized g-V relationships and inactivation curves were fit with a Boltzmann distribution, 1/(1 + exp((V − V 12)/k)), where V 12 is the voltage at which half-activation or half-inactivation occurred and k is a slope factor. The time courses of current decay and recovery from inactivation were described with two exponentials, a(1 − exp(−t/τ1)) + (1 − a)(1 − exp(−t/τ2)), where a is the fraction of the fast component, τ1 is the time constant of the fast component, and τ2 is the time constant of the slow component.

The electrophysiological properties of the two wild-type sodium channels and each chimeric channel were analyzed in two-microelectrode whole-cell voltage-clamp experiments inXenopus oocytes. Fig. 1 shows typical sodium currents elicited from WT rIIA and rH1 α subunits expressed alone in Xenopus oocytes. The resolution of the two-microelectrode voltage clamp of small oocytes (25Krafte D.S. Lester H.A. J. Neurosci. Methods. 1989; 26: 211-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) was adequate for detailed analysis of the kinetics of inactivation, but the rate of activation was not resolved with sufficient precision for accurate analysis. As reported previously (23Cribbs L.L. Satin J. Fozzard H.A. Rogart R.B. FEBS Lett. 1990; 275: 195-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 24White M.M. Chen L.-Q. Kleinfield R. Kallen R.G. Barchi R.L. Mol. Pharmacol. 1991; 39: 604-608PubMed Google Scholar), the rate of inactivation of the rH1 α subunit was faster than that of the rIIA α subunit expressed alone in Xenopus oocytes (Fig. 1, A andB). Coexpression of β1 subunits greatly accelerated inactivation of rIIA α subunits (Fig. 1 A), but had little effect on the rH1 α subunit (Fig. 1 B). Modulation by the β1 subunits therefore results in faster activation and inactivation of wild-type rIIA than rH1 α subunits. To examine the functional role of the extracellular loops in the sodium channel α subunit, we substituted each predicted extracellular loop in the brain rIIA α subunit individually with the corresponding sequence of the heart sodium channel rH1 α subunit (TableI), except for the loop between S3 and S4 in domain I, which is identical between rIIA and rH1. No sodium current was detected when oocytes were injected with mRNAs from two chimeras, one having substitutions in loop IIS1-S2 and the other in IIS3-S4. Although these two extracellular loop chimeras were not analyzed in this study, a set of single amino acid chimeras containing each of the amino acid differences in these two extracellular loops was analyzed previously, and no changes in sodium channel gating or response to β1 subunits were observed (14Cestèle S.

McCormick, T. Scheuer, and W. A. Catterall, unpublished results. Each of the other 13 extracellular loop chimeras gave sodium currents sufficient for detailed analysis (0.5–5 μA). For most chimeras, the expression level was comparable to that of WT when 20 ng of each mRNA was injected. For chimeras with lower expression levels than WT, up to 160 ng of α subunit mRNA was injected to obtain sodium currents of similar amplitude to those observed for 20 ng of WT α subunit mRNA.Table IAmino acid sequences of sodium channel chimerasExtracellular loopSequenceIS1-S2 rIIaSNPPDWTKN ChangesHD––P–––YIS3-S4 rIIaFVDLGNVSAL Changes––––––––––IS5-SS1 rIIaNKCLQWPPDN STFEINITSF FNNSLDWNGT AFNRTVNMFN ChangesH––VR––––– NFT–L–G––– ––G–VEAD–L VW––––––NS rIIaWDEYIEDKSH FYFLEGQNDA LLCGNSSDAG QCPEGYICVK AGRNPNYGYT SF ChangesL–V–LN–PAN YLLKN–TT–V –––––––––– T–––––R–L– ––E––DH––– ––ISS2-S6 rIIaNLYQLTLRAA GKTY ChangesR–––Q–––S– ––I–IIS1-S2 rIIaEHYPMTEQFS SV Changes–––N––AE–E EMIIS3-S4 rIIaANVEGLS ChangesSRMGN––IIS5-SS1 rIIaKSYKECVCKI SNDCELPRWH MHH Changes–N–S–LRHR– –DSGL––––– –MDIISS2-S6 rIIaETMWDCMEVA GQT Changes–––––––––S ––SIIIS1-S2 rIIaEDIYIEQRKT IKT Changes––––L–E––– ––VIIIS3-S4 rIIaALGYSE Changes–T––YAIIIS5-SS1 rIIaKFYHCINYTT GEM.FDVSVV NNYSECQALI ESNQTARWKN VKVNFD Changes––GR–––Q–E –DLPLNYTI– ––K–––ESFN VTGELYWT–– ––––––IIISS2-S6 rIIaDIMYAAVDSR NVELQPKYED Changes–––––––––– GY–E––QW––IVS1-S2 rIIaETDDQSQEMT N Changes––––––P–KV –IVS3-S4 rIIaKYFVSPTLF Changes–––F–––––IVS5-SS1 rIIaREVGIDDMFN FE ChangesW–A––––––– –QIVSS2-S6 rIIaGLLAPILNSG PPDCDPEKDH PGSSVKGDCG NPS Changes–––S––––T– ––Y–––NLPN SNG––R–N–– S–A Open table in a new tab The voltage dependence of activation of WT rIIA and rH1 α subunits and selected α subunit chimeras expressed alone in Xenopus oocytes is illustrated as conductance-voltage curves in Fig.2 A, and the mean values forV a, the voltage for half-maximal activation, are presented in Fig. 2 C. V a for rH1 is 18 mV more negative than for rIIA (Fig. 2, A and C,open symbols). Five chimeras (IIS5-SS1, IISS2-S6, IIIS1-S2, IIISS2-S6, and IVS3-S4) had a more negative voltage dependence of activation than WT rIIA (Fig. 2, A and C). Only chimera IVSS2-S6 was observed to have a slightly more positive voltage dependence of activation than WT rIIA. Thus, these extracellular loops are important determinants of the voltage dependence of activation and contribute to the more negative voltage dependence observed for cardiac rH1 channels. If their effects were additive, they would more than account for the difference in activation gating between the two channels. The voltage dependence of steady-state inactivation was studied with 100-ms conditioning prepulses. With this protocol, the voltage for half-inactivation of rH1 was 17 mV more negative than that of rIIA (Fig. 2 B). Three chimeras (IISS2-S6, IIIS1-S2, and IVS3-S4) inactivated at more negative potentials than WT rIIA, but at more positive potentials than rH1 (Fig. 2 B). These were the only chimeras that had a shifted voltage dependence of inactivation (Fig.2 D). The three chimeras whose voltage dependence of inactivation was negatively shifted (IISS2-S6, IIIS1-S2, and IVS3-S4) also had a negatively shifted voltage dependence of activation (Fig. 2,C and D), suggesting that the change in inactivation results from coupling to the negatively shifted activation. Thus, these three extracellular loops are important determinants of the voltage dependence of inactivation as well as activation. Together, the negative shifts in steady-state inactivation observed for these three chimeras would be more than sufficient to account for the difference in the voltage dependence of inactivation between the rIIA and rH1 α subunits. Expression of the WT rIIA α subunit alone inXenopus oocytes produced a slowly inactivating sodium current (Fig. 3 A, slow solid lines). The time courses of the decay of these sodium currents are well fit by a sum of fast and slow exponentials, with the fraction of fast inactivation (F fast) less than 0.1 for rIIA α subunits expressed alone and near 1.0 for rH1 expressed alone (Fig. 3 E). The slowly inactivating component of this biphasic time course has previously been shown to result from a slow gating mode that is particularly prominent for type IIA α subunits expressed alone in Xenopus oocytes (7Auld V.J. Goldin A.L. Krafte D.S. Catterall W.A. Lester H.A. Davidson N. Dunn R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 323-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 26Moorman J.R. Kirsch G.E.

Neuron. 1991; 7: 755-785Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). It is not thought to be related to the distinct slow inactivation process of sodium channels, which requires longer depolarization and involves a different gating mechanism than fast inactivation (28Adelman W.J. Palti Y. J. Gen. Physiol. 1968; 54: 589-606Crossref Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 29Narahashi T. J. Cell. Comp. Physiol. 1964; 64: 73-96Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 30Ogata N. Tatebayashi H. J.

Ruben P.C. Biophys. J. 1996; 71: 3098-3109Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Most chimeras displayed a similar time course of inactivation to that of WT at a test potential of +10 mV. However, five chimeras (IS5-SS1, ISS2-S6, IISS2-S6, IIIS1-S2, and IVS3-S4) inactivated faster than WT (Fig. 3, A–D). As for WT, analysis of these sodium currents revealed that they could be fit by two exponential functions with fixed time constants, but with an increased fraction of channels inactivating with the faster time constant (Fig. 3 E). These results indicate that the differences of these chimeric channels from WT are caused by a shift of the chimeric channels from the slow to the fast gating mode. Thus, these five extracellular segments are important determinants of the channel gating mode. The rate of recovery from inactivation at negative holding potentials was studied by repolarization to −100 mV following a conditioning pulse to −10 mV for 300 ms. As for inactivation, the time course of recovery from inactivation for WT rIIA channels expressed without β1 subunits can be described by a sum of two exponentials, with approximately half of the channels recovering rapidly from inactivation (Fig. 4 A). Using this protocol, the fraction of fast recovery from inactivation is ∼0.6 for rIIA and 0.9 for rH1 (Fig. 4 E). For most chimeric channels, the fraction of fast recovery from inactivation was similar to that of WT rIIA α subunits (Fig. 4 E). However, four chimeras that inactivated rapidly (IS5-SS1, ISS2-S6, IISS2-S6, and IIIS1-S2) also had faster kinetics of recovery from inactivation compared with WT rIIA channels (Fig. 4, A–D, closed circles for chimeras versus open circles for rIIA). This accelerated recovery from inactivation was caused by a shift of channels from the slow gating mode to the fast gating mode, as illustrated in the measurements of F fast in Fig.4 E. The effects of these chimeric substitutions on the kinetics of inactivation and recovery from inactivation indicate that four extracellular loops in domains I and III are important determinants of the sodium channel gating mode and that segment IVS3-S4 also has a minor effect. These are the first regions of the sodium channel structure found to have specific effects on the gating mode. As for the effects on voltage dependence, these effects of chimeric substitutions on the gating mode would be sufficient to fully account for the difference between rIIA and rH1 if they were additive. When either brain or skeletal muscle sodium channel α subunits are expressed alone in Xenopus oocytes, the resulting sodium currents are small, and they activate and inactivate abnormally slowly (6Auld V.J.

Similar experiments with human cardiac α and β1 subunits revealed significant effects of coexpression of β1 subunits on the voltage dependence of inactivation, but these effects were much smaller than those observed for brain or skeletal muscle sodium channels (41Makielski J.C. Limberis J.T. Chang S.Y. Fan Z. Kyle J.N. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 49: 30-39PubMed Google Scholar, 42Nuss H.B. Chiamvimonvat N. Pérez-Garcia M.T. Tomaselli G.F. Marbán E. J. Gen. Physiol. 1995; 106: 1171-1191Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). These differences in response to coexpression of β1 subunits suggested that analysis of brain/cardiac sodium channel chimeras may reveal extracellular loops required for β1 subunit binding or modulation of α subunit function. Effects of β1 subunits on the sodium channel gating mode are most easily assessed from measurement of the kinetics of inactivation and recovery from inactivation and analysis by exponential curve fitting. Coexpression of the β1 subunit substantially accelerated the kinetics of inactivation of rIIA (Fig.3 A, fast solid lines). The increased rate of inactivation was fit by an increase in F fastfrom <0.1 to ∼0.9 for an α/β1 subunit RNA ratio of 1:4 (Fig. 3,E and F). Coexpression of β1 subunits at that level substantially accelerated the rate of inactivation of all chimeras (Fig. 3, A–D, dotted lines). With an α/β1 subunit RNA molar ratio of 1:4, most chimeric channels displayed a fraction of fast inactivation near 0.9, comparable to WT rIIA in the presence of β1 subunits (Fig. 3 F). In contrast, chimera IVSS2-S6 showed a substantially decreased fraction of fast inactivating channels compared with WT in the presence of β1 subunits (Fig. 3 F).

Asp38 (pK a ∼4.7) was identified as the general base abstracting the steroid C4β proton (pK a ∼12.7) to form a dienolate intermediate. A key and common enigmatic issue involved in the proton abstraction is the question of how the energy required for the unfavorable proton transfer can be provided at the active site of the enzyme and/or how the thermodynamic barrier can be drastically reduced. Answering this question has been hindered by the existence of two differently proposed enzyme reaction mechanisms. The 2.26 Å crystal structure of the enzyme in complex with a reaction intermediate analogue equilenin reveals clearly that both the Tyr14 OH and Asp99 COOH provide direct hydrogen bonds to the oxyanion of equilenin. The result negates the catalytic dyad mechanism in which Asp99 donates the hydrogen bond to Tyr14, which in turn is hydrogen bonded to the steroid. A theoretical calculation also favors the doubly hydrogen-bonded system over the dyad system. Proton nuclear magnetic resonance analyses of several mutant enzymes indicate that the Tyr14 OH forms a low barrier hydrogen bond with the dienolic oxyanion of the intermediate.

In almost all the reactions, an α-proton is abstracted from a carbon adjacent to a carbonyl or carboxyl group by an active site residue, because these protons are acidic by resonance stabilization of the carbanion intermediates. Despite the acidifying effect, the pK a values of the α-protons are typically much higher (∼16–20) than that of an enzymatic base group (<7) involved in the proton abstraction (3Gerlt J.A. Gassman P.G. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1992; 114: 5928-5934Crossref Scopus (218) Google Scholar). The unfavorable proton transfer requires the energy given as 2.303RTΔpK a (3Gerlt J.A. Gassman P.G. J. Am.

The reaction consists of enolate formation and reketonization that are involved in a wide variety of biologically important reactions of carbonyl compounds. The enzyme, a homodimer in solution, is a “perfect enzyme” enhancing the catalytic rate by a factor of 11 orders of magnitude (7Radzicka A. Wolfenden R.

Acta. 1955; 18: 300-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), it has been intensively studied as a prototype for understanding the chemical and thermodynamic aspects of enzyme-catalyzed C-H bond cleavage. Three residues have been shown by site-directed mutagenesis and kinetic studies to be important for the catalysis: Tyr14 (9Kuliopulos A. Talalay P. Mildvan A.S. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 10271-10280Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), Asp38 (9Kuliopulos A. Talalay P. Mildvan A.S.

The latter enzyme shares 34% sequence identity with P. testosteroni KSI and retains the three catalytic residues identically. It is generally agreed upon that Asp38 serves as the general base abstracting the C4β proton of the steroid substrate. This proton transfer poses a common major mechanistic enigma of how a strong acid enzymatic group serves as a general base to abstract proton from a much weaker acid group in a substrate. The large disparity in ΔpK a of ∼8 between Asp38 (pK a ∼4.7) (12Hawkinson D.C. Pollack R.M. Ambulos Jr., N.P. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 12172-12183Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) and the C4β proton of the steroid substrate (pK a ∼12.7) (13Pollack R.M. Mack J.P.G. Eldin S. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1987; 109: 5048-5050Crossref Scopus (32) Google Scholar) requires 11 kcal/mol of energy according to the equation. The energy has to be supplied in the course of the enzyme reaction and/or the ΔpK a should be substantially reduced at the enzyme active site by the transition state stabilization to account for the high turnover rate. It has not yet been settled how Tyr14and Asp99 interact with the dienolic intermediate, and thus the underlying mechanism for the enormous rate enhancement by the enzyme cannot be addressed properly. Two different hydrogen bonding schemes for the transition state stabilization have been proposed. In the first proposal, both Tyr14 and Asp99directly provide hydrogen bonds (H-bonds) to the enolate oxygen of the intermediate (Fig. 1, mechanism I). This has been supported by the model building of the substrate into the solution structure of the free enzyme (11Wu Z.R. Ebrahimian S. Zawrotny M.E. Thornburg L.D. Perez-Alvarado G.C. Brothers P. Pollack R.M. Summers M.F. Science. 1997; 276: 415-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar) and by the 2.5 Å crystal structure of P. putida KSI in complex with equilenin (10Kim S.W. Cha S.-S.

The second proposal involves a hydrogen-bonded catalytic dyad, Asp99 COOH–Tyr14 OH–O-steroid, consisting of normal hydrogen bonds in the enzyme-substrate complex. As the intermediate dienolate is formed, the H-bond between Asp99and Tyr14 is strengthened to form a low barrier hydrogen bond (LBHB) that facilitates polarization of the C3-keto group of the steroids (Fig. 1, mechanism II). This proposal is primarily based on the detection and assignment to the Asp99 COOH of a highly deshielded proton NMR peak at 18.15 ppm in the presence of dihydroequilenin (14Zhao Q. Abeygunawardana C. Gittis A.G. Mildvan A.S. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 14616-14626Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar).

The resolution (2.5 Å) of the crystal structure ofP. putida KSI complexed with equilenin was criticized as being insufficient to distinguish distances shorter than 0.75 Å and to discern other possible binding modes of equilenin (19Massiah M.A. Abeygunawardana C. Gittis A.G. Mildvan A.S. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 14701-14712Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). To resolve this conflicting issue and provide a sound ground for addressing the more significant issue of how the enormous rate enhancement is achieved by the enzyme, we have determined the structure of P. testosteroni KSI in complex with equilenin (Scheme1). The elucidation of the equilenin binding modes observed for the six KSI molecules in the asymmetric unit of the crystal, together with the previously reported structure of the uninhibited enzyme (20Cho H.-S. Choi G. Choi K.Y. Oh B.-H. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 8325-8330Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), settles the confusion regarding the catalytic mechanism of this heavily studied enzyme.Scheme 1View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) D38N mutant enzyme was used for the structure determination of KSI in complex with equilenin because it binds steroid analogues more tightly than the wild-type enzyme owing to the absence of the negative charge at the residue 38 (12Hawkinson D.C. Pollack R.M. Ambulos Jr., N.P. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 12172-12183Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Furthermore, Asn38 mimics the protonated form of Asp38 in the transition state. D38N mutant gene was constructed by site-directed mutagenesis using a Muta-gene mutagenesis kit (Bio-Rad). For NMR studies, P. putida KSI mutant genes D38N, D38N/Y14F, and D38N/D99L were prepared similarly. Overexpression and purification of the wild-type and the mutant enzymes were carried out as described previously (21Kim S.W. Choi K.Y. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 2602-2605Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) with a slight modification. The mutant KSI genes were subcloned into the EcoRI and HindIII sites of pKK223-3 to construct a recombinant plasmids. The enzymes were expressed in the Escherichia coli strain BL21 (DE3) transformed with each of the plasmids when induced with 0.5 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside. Unlike other mutant enzymes, the D38N/D99L mutant KSI was expressed in lower quantities and mostly as inclusion bodies. The crude lysate containing overexpressed KSI was applied directly onto a deoxycholate affinity column equilibrated with 40 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) containing 1 mm EDTA. After the column was washed, the bound proteins containing KSI were eluted with 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.0) containing 25% ethanol and finally separated on a Superose 12 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The purified enzymes, which showed a homogeneous single band on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, were concentrated by Centricon-10 (Amicon) for crystallization. It was quite difficult to obtain suitable crystals of P. testosteroni KSI in either the uninhibited (20Cho H.-S. Choi G. Choi K.Y. Oh B.-H. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 8325-8330Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) or the inhibited state. The crystals of the complex were obtained by co-crystallization method. Small amount of equilenin was dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide, and 2 μl of the solution was mixed with 70 μl of enzyme solution (10 mg/ml). Saturated amount of equilenin was ensured by the presence of white precipitate of the compound formed immediately after the mixing. The crystals grew in droplets containing a 2-μl protein sample and an equal volume of precipitant solution containing 25% polyethylene glycol 4000, 0.1 m sodium acetate (pH 4.6), and 0.2 m ammonium sulfate at 12 °C. The crystallization conditions were different from those used for the uninhibited wild-type enzyme (20Cho H.-S. Choi G. Choi K.Y. Oh B.-H. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 8325-8330Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), where 1.3 m ammonium sulfate was the major precipitant. Like the crystals of uninhibited enzyme, the crystals of the complex tended to grow in clusters of microcrystals under many different conditions. While refining 15 different initial crystallization conditions for a long period of time, one crystal happened to grow into a large single crystal (0.15 × 0.2 × 0.3 mm) with which we were able to determine the structure. The crystal belongs to the space group P21 with unit cell dimensions of a = 73.90 Å, b= 72.51 Å, c = 83.83 Å, β = 104.29 ° and contains three dimers of the enzyme in the asymmetric unit. There is no local symmetry between the three dimers, and the crystal packing environment of each dimer is different from the others. Diffraction data (TableI) were measured on a DIP2020 area detector with graphite monochromated CuKα x-rays generated by a MacScience M18XHF rotating anode generator operated at 90 mA and 50 kV at room temperature. Data reduction, merging, and scaling were accomplished with the programs DENZO and SCALEPACK (22Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38617) Google Scholar). The structure was solved by the molecular replacement protocol in theX-PLOR program package (23Brünger A.T. X-PLOR, Version 3.843. Yale University Press, New Haven, CT1992Google Scholar) using the dimeric structure of the uninhibited enzyme (20Cho H.-S. Choi G. Choi K.Y. Oh B.-H. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 8325-8330Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) as a search model. Patterson correlation refinement followed by a rotation search yielded three refined rotation function peaks that were outstanding from noise level solutions. Translation searches along the xz plane with the three refined rotation function peaks resulted in top solutions that were about 1.2 ς above the next highest unrelated peaks. Translation searches along the y axis for origin correlation yielded correct translation positions as judged by no serious overlaps between symmetry mates. The rigid body refinement of the translation solutions, consisting of 20 steps of conjugate gradient minimization against reflections at 10–4.0 Å resolution, resulted in anR-factor of 34.8%. 5% of the reflections was set aside for monitoring R free. Even at this stage, strong electron densities for equilenins bound to the six monomers were clearly visible. Several rounds of manual refitting and atomic positional refinement were carried out to yield anR working of 26.2% at 10.0–2.26 Å resolution. Guided by the 2F o − F cand F o − F c electron density maps, equilenins were fit into the electron densities. Especially, the protruding density for the C13 methyl group of equilenin warranted unambiguous fittings. Strong electron density, observed between two symmetry related molecules in the middle of two arginine and two histidine residues, was interpreted as a sulfate ion, which was included in the crystallization conditions. The current model containing a total of 156 water molecules and one sulfate anion exhibits an R working of 19.6% (R free = 25.6%).

Open table in a new tab Proton NMR spectra of P. putidaKSIs were collected with Bruker Avance DRX500 spectrometer at −3 °C except for the spectrum of D38N/D99L mutant, which was collected at −6 °C. Jump-and-return pulse sequence (24Platue P. Gueron M. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1982; 104: 7310-7311Crossref Scopus (1142) Google Scholar) was employed to suppress water signal. Typically, a total of 1024 transients in 32,768 data points, relaxation time of 2.0 s, and spectral width of 17,000 Hz were used. Line broadening of 10 Hz was employed in processing free induction decays with XWIN-NMR software (Bruker Instruments). The chemical shift was referenced from that of tetramethylsilane as an internal standard. The energetics and reactivity of the two different mechanisms were compared using density functional calculations employing Becke-3-Lee-Yang-Parr (B3LYP) functionals and 6–31+G* basis set (25Frisch M.J. Gaussian 94. Gaussian Inc., Pittsburgh, PA1995Google Scholar). The structures of the active site having the three key catalytic residues were fully optimized without constraints. In the calculation, Asp38, Asp99, Tyr14, and the steroid substrate were simply modeled as formate, formic acid, phenol, and β,γ-enone derivative, respectively. The structure of KSI is a conical closed barrel formed by a highly curved β-sheet and three α-helices (Fig. 2). The widely open end of the structure forms the entrance to the deep active site cavity tapering off to a blocked wall, which is inaccessible from the other narrow end. So far, three other proteins, bearing no sequence and functional homology to each other and to KSI, have been found to have a similar tertiary structure: scytalone dehydratase (26Lundqvist T. Rice J. Hodge C.N. Basarab G.S. Pierce J. Lindqvist Y. Structure. 1994; 2: 937-944Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar), nuclear transport factor 2 (27Bullock T.L. Clarkson W.D. Kent H.M. Stewart M. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 260: 422-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar), and the β subunit of naphthalene dioxygenase (28Kauppi B. Lee K. Carredano E. Parales R.E. Gibson D.T. Eklund H. Ramaswamy S. Structure. 1998; 6: 571-586Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar). Considering the hydrophobic nature of the substrates for the three enzymes, the observed folding pattern appears to be a general scaffold for an active site cavity that binds hydrophobic substrates. The two critical catalytic residues, Tyr14 and Asp99, are close to each other and located deeply in the active site cavity, whereas Asp38 is located in the midway of the cavity (Fig. 2). The most prominent feature of the active site is the highly apolar characteristics as a result of the lining by 22 nonpolar amino acid side chains (20Cho H.-S. Choi G. Choi K.Y. Oh B.-H. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 8325-8330Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), which constitute a favorable environment for the binding of the steroid substrates. The side chain of Asp99, surrounded by apolar side chains of Phe80, Phe82, Pro97, Phe101, Met112, and Ala114, is believed to have an unusually elevated pK a of 9.5 to account for the sharp decrease in the enzyme activity at pH 9.5 (29Weintraub H. Alfsen A. Baulieu E.-E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1970; 12: 217-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) and for the presence of a group with pK a of 9.5 near Tyr14 as indicated by fluorescence titration (30Li Y.K. Kuliopulos A. Mildvan A.S. Talalay P. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 1816-1824Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). In the structure of P. testosteroni KSI complexed with equilenin, two different binding modes of equilenin were observed because of different crystal packing interactions. Although equilenins bound to four KSI molecules in the asymmetric unit of the crystal are exposed to the bulk solvent, equilenins bound to the remaining two KSI molecules participate in the crystal packing interactions with neighboring molecules. In the four KSI molecules, equilenin shows the normal binding mode, which explains much of the biochemical and mutational data piled on this enzyme (Fig.3). The side chain of Asn38is located distinctively above the β-face of the steroid with its Nδ2 atom within 3.6 Å of both the C4 and C6 of equilenin. This explains the stereospecific proton transfer between the two positions. The side chains of both Tyr14 and Asp99 are within H-bond distance from the C3 oxygen of the inhibitor. Thus, the two residues should be able to provide H-bonds for the stabilization of the developing negative charge on the C3 oxygen of the steroid substrate upon loosing the C4β proton. Mutations of Y14F and D99A result in 50,000-fold (31Kuliopulos A. Mildvan A.S. Shortle D. Talalay P. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 149-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar) and 5,000-fold (11Wu Z.R. Ebrahimian S. Zawrotny M.E. Thornburg L.D. Perez-Alvarado G.C. Brothers P. Pollack R.M. Summers M.F. Science. 1997; 276: 415-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar) decrease ink cat, respectively. In the other two KSI molecules, the C17-keto oxygen of equilenin is involved in H-bonds via a water molecule with the side chains of Arg13 and Asp22 from a symmetry mate. In addition, the steroid C ring is in close contact with Ala20 from the same symmetry mate. These interactions resulted in a nonproductive binding, the best description of which would be a rotation of the productive binding by ∼180 ° about the C3-O bond of equilenin (Fig. 3). The nonproductive binding observed in the crystal structure is not relevant in solution. Regardless of the binding modes, the C3 oxygen is involved in direct H-bonds with the side chains of both Tyr14 and Asp99 (Table II). The high pK a of Asp99 and its direct interaction with the inhibitor indicate that the bound inhibitor should be in the anion form (pK a ∼ 9.0) (32Zhao Q. Abeygunawardana C. Talalay P. Mildvan A.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 8220-8224Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), whereas Tyr14 OH (pK a ∼11.6) (30Li Y.K. Kuliopulos A. Mildvan A.S. Talalay P. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 1816-1824Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) and Asp99 COOH are in the protonated states for favorable interactions. Therefore, it is apparent that the high pK a of Asp99 is to insure the stabilization of the developing negative charge on the C3 oxygen of the dienolate intermediate together with the Tyr14 OH by forming a charged H-bond.Table IIInteratomic distances among Tyr 14 O η, Asp 99 O δ2, and the equilenin C3-oxygen in the six monomers of KSI comprising the asymmetric unit of the crystalDistance2-aAverage distance ± standard deviation.ÅTyr14Oη–C3-O2.58 ± 0.08Asp99 Oδ2–C3-O2.62 ± 0.07Tyr14 Oη–Asp99 Oδ24.08 ± 0.102-a Average distance ± standard deviation. Open table in a new tab More than 90 different steroid compounds are known to inhibit KSI (33Weintraub H. Vincent F. Baulieu E.-E. Alfsen A. Biochemistry. 1977; 16: 5045-5053Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Some compounds may bind to KSI “backwards” with the steroid D ring approaching the catalytic residues. This has been suggested by the covalent modification of Asp38 by oxyrane compounds containing an epoxide ring either at the steroid A ring or at the D ring (34Bevins C.L. Bantia S. Pollack R.M. Bounds R.L. Kayser R.H. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1984; 106: 4957-4962Crossref Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The large active site cavity of KSI allowing two different equilenin binding modes explains the backward binding, although it is not observed in the crystal structure. It was possible to dock equilenin backwards into the active site without any steric or electrostatic violation so that the C17-keto group of equilenin interacted with Tyr14 and Asp99 (with the aid of solid docking module in the program Quanta). The ionization of the C3-hydroxyl group should favor the normal binding mode over the backward binding where the C17-keto oxygen would form weaker neutral H-bonds with Tyr14 and Asp99. We speculate that the steroid compounds containing a keto oxygen at both the C3 and C17 positions would bind to KSI normally or backward with similar affinities. Table II shows the H-bond distances from Tyr14 OH and Asp99 COOH to the C3 oxygen of equilenin and those between the two residues in the six molecules of KSI. Because the electron densities for the two residues and equilenin are well defined, the H-bond distances should be well defined within the coordinates errors less than 0.3 Å for all atoms as estimated by Luzzati plot (35Luzzati P.V. Acta Crystallogr. 1952; 5: 802-810Crossref Google Scholar). Clearly, Tyr14 and Asp99 are beyond H-bond distance (>4 Å) regardless of the inhibitor binding modes, negating the catalytic dyad mechanism. On the basis of a comparison of the solution structures of the enzyme and that in complex with 19-nortestosterone hemisuccinate (19-NTHS), it was noted by other investigators that the binding of 19-NTHS to the active site resulted in the movement of the three α-helices, with the Tyr14 OH approaching the Asp99 COOH. This provided a physical ground for the direct H-bond between the two residues (19Massiah M.A. Abeygunawardana C. Gittis A.G. Mildvan A.S. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 14701-14712Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). In contrast, our comparison of the crystal structures of the uninhibited KSI and the enzyme complexed with equilenin shows no noticeable movement of the α-helices (Fig. 4). The rmsd after superposition of the backbone atoms of the two structures is less than 0.22 Å for any of the six monomers, whereas the rmsd values after superposition of the backbone atoms of the solution structures of TI and TI/19-NTHS are 1.26 ± 0.11 and 1.30 ± 0.13 Å for the two subunits. Probably, the large rmsd values of the assemble NMR structures (TI, 1.54 ± 0.24 Å; TI/19-NTHS, 1.58 ± 0.41 Å for dimer backbone atoms) would have led to the conjecture that the inhibitor binding causes the movement of the α-helices. It has been a controversial issue (36Scheiner S. Kar T. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1995; 117: 6970-6975Crossref Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 37Shan S. Loh S. Herschlag D.

Chem. 1998; 273: 25529-25532Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar) that special types of short, strong H-bonds, termed LBHBs, play an important role in the catalytic reaction of many enzymes by providing a large amount of stabilization energy (more than 10 kcal/mol) (17Cleland W.W. Kreevoy M.M. Science. 1994; 264: 1887-1890Crossref PubMed Scopus (1048) Google Scholar, 18Frey P.A. Whitt S.A. Tobin J.B. Science. 1994; 264: 1927-1930Crossref PubMed Scopus (731) Google Scholar). Here, we confine the term to the H-bonds that display highly deshielded 1H NMR resonances but may not necessarily be as strong as proposed. A characteristic resonance is detectable at 18.15 ppm in the complex of P. testosteroniKSI with dihydroequilenin (32Zhao Q. Abeygunawardana C. Talalay P. Mildvan A.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 8220-8224Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) that contains a hydroxyl group at the C17 position instead of a keto oxygen compared with equilenin. The resonance disappears upon substitution of either Y14F or D99A (14Zhao Q. Abeygunawardana C. Gittis A.G. Mildvan A.S. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 14616-14626Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Assignment of the 18.15 ppm resonance to a LBHB between Asp99 COOH and Tyr14 OH in mechanism II provides an explanation for the disappearance of the resonance by either of the two substitutions. We suggest that the resonance arises from the LBHB between the Tyr14 OH and the oxyanion of the bound inhibitor and that the disappearance of the peak by the D99A mutation can be explained by the solvent effect. A void space generated by the alanine substitution is expected to increase the access of the bulk solvent, resulting in a decrease in the strength of the H-bond between Tyr14 OH and the bound inhibitor with an increase of dielectric constant. In small molecular systems, unusually downfield-shifted resonances were observed only in the absence of a water molecule (18Frey P.A. Whitt S.A. Tobin J.B. Science. 1994; 264: 1927-1930Crossref PubMed Scopus (731) Google Scholar). Our proposal can be tested by recording a NMR spectrum of the D38N/D99L double mutant of P. testosteroniKSI in which Leu99 would prevent the access of the bulk solvent. Although we could not obtain this mutant because of a very low expression level and insoluble nature, we were able to obtain the D38N/D99L mutant of P. putida KSI in sufficient quantity for NMR analysis. Like P. testosteroni KSI, the D38N mutant ofP. putida KSI also exhibits a highly deshielded resonance at 16.8 ppm in the presence of equilenin (Fig.5 B). A slightly deshielded peak at 13.1 ppm also appears in the spectrum of this mutant. In the spectrum of the D38N/D99L mutant, the 13.1 ppm peak disappears, but the 16.8 ppm is retained and further downfield shifted by 0.9 ppm (Fig.5 C). The 16.8 ppm peak disappears in the D38N/Y14F mutant (Fig. 5 D). Therefore, the 16.8 ppm peak can be assigned to the Tyr14 OH, and the 13.1 ppm peak can be assigned to the Asp99 COOH. The 0.9 ppm downfield shift, upon the substitution of the D99L, is most likely because of an increase in H-bond strength between the Tyr14 OH and the bound inhibitor caused by a decrease in dielectric constant at the immediate vicinity of Tyr14. In the D38N/Y14F mutant, the 13.1 ppm peak also disappears. This can be explained by a fast exchange of the inhibitor because of the loss of the H-bond of Tyr14. The line width of the 17.7 ppm peak in the D38N/D99L mutant (Fig.5 C) broader than that of the corresponding peak in the D38N mutant (Fig. 5 B) can also be explained by an increased exchange rate of the inhibitor because of the loss of the H-bond of Asp99. The observations support that the LBHB of Tyr14 is stronger than the H-bond of Asp99. We have confirmed by crystal structure determinations that equilenin binds to the D38N/D99L mutant in the same manner as to the D38N mutant ofP. putida KSI (data not shown). The highly homologous tertiary, quaternary, and active site environment between the two KSIs strongly suggests that the same spectroscopic results would be obtained for the D38N/D99L double mutant of P. testosteroni KSI. Including the LBHB observed for KSIs, the highly deshielded1H resonances have been detected only for charged H-bonds that should be stronger than neutral H-bonds. These observations, the disappearance of the 18.5 ppm resonance upon D99A mutation in P. testosteroni KSI, and the upfield shift of such resonances with increase in ΔpK a between two heteroatoms (40Petrounia I. Pollack R.M. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 700-705Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) suggest that the anomalously shifted resonances do indeed correlate with unusual strengths of LBHBs. In addition to the x-ray and NMR analyses, ab initio theoretical calculations were employed for the comparison of the energetics and catalytic reactivity of the doubly H-bonded oxyanion system (mechanism I) with those of the catalytic dyad system (mechanism II). In both mechanisms I and II, each whole reaction path from the enzyme-substrate reactant to the product was found to have two rate-determining steps that are almost symmetric with respect to the enzyme-substrate intermediate, although the enzyme product is ∼6 kcal/mol lower in energy than enzyme-substrate reactant. The predicted energy profile including the transition state of the first rate-determining step responsible fork cat is shown in Fig.6. The molecular system in mechanism I is more stabilized than that in mechanism II. The energies of the enzyme-substrate reactant, transition state, and enzyme-substrate intermediate in mechanism I are lower than those of the three species in mechanism II by 0.96, 2.84, and 3.55 kcal/mol, respectively. In particular, the enzyme-substrate intermediate of mechanism II is less stable than that of mechanism I, because in the former mechanism the hydroxyl proton of phenol as a mimic of Tyr14 transfers partially to the steroid C3 oxygen whose proton-donating strength is greater than that of phenol. The extra stabilization of the intermediate state in mechanism I is reflected in its activation barrier of 5.53 kcal/mol in comparison with 7.41 kcal/mol in mechanism II. The lower activation energy barrier in mechanism I is more effective in stability and reactivity by 25-fold than in mechanism II. Thus, the ab initio theoretical results clearly favor the doubly charged H-bonds over the catalytic dyad, and this is in agreement with the crystal structures. KSI should have evolved to choose the more efficient low lying energy pathway. A full description of the calculations will be reported elsewhere. In conclusion, the 2.26 Å resolution structure of KSI in complex with equilenin, the NMR spectroscopic evidences, and the theoretical calculations indicate that both Tyr14 and Asp99should be directly involved in the stabilization of the dienolate intermediate and that Tyr14 provides a LBHB to the intermediate in the highly apolar milieu of the active site. Owing to the simplicity of the reaction mechanism that is settled now, KSI is an excellent system for answering the contentious issue of how enzymes achieve rate accelerations of 108-1015. Furthermore, the availability of a wide variety of KSI inhibitors should allow probing detailed nature of LBHBs by spectroscopic methods directly at the enzyme active site with the clear picture of the equilenin binding mode."
https://openalex.org/W2115873650,"We examined the activation and regulation of calcium release-activated calcium current (I crac) in RBL-1 cells in response to various Ca2+ store-depleting agents. With [Ca2+] i strongly buffered to 100 nm,I crac was activated by ionomycin, thapsigargin, inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3), and two metabolically stable IP3 receptor agonists, adenophostin A andl-α-glycerophospho-d-myoinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (GPIP2). With minimal [Ca2+] i buffering, with [Ca2+] i free to fluctuateI crac was activated by ionomycin, thapsigargin, and by the potent IP3 receptor agonist, adenophostin A, but not by GPIP2 or IP3 itself. Likewise, when [Ca2+] i was strongly buffered to 500 nm, ionomycin, thapsigargin, and adenophostin A did and GPIP2 and IP3 did not activate detectableI crac. However, with minimal [Ca2+] i buffering, or with [Ca2+] i buffered to 500 nm, GPIP2 was able to fully activate detectableI crac if uptake of Ca2+intracellular stores was first inhibited. Our findings suggest that when IP3 activates the IP3 receptor, the resulting influx of Ca2+ quickly inactivates the receptor, and Ca2+ is re-accumulated at sites that regulateI crac. Adenophostin A, by virtue of its high receptor affinity, is resistant to this inactivation. Comparison of thapsigargin-releasable Ca2+ pools following activation by different IP3 receptor agonists indicates that the critical regulatory pool of Ca2+ may be very small in comparison to the total IP3-sensitive component of the endoplasmic reticulum. These findings reveal new and important roles for IP3 receptors located on discrete IP3-sensitive Ca2+ pools in calcium feedback regulation ofI crac and capacitative calcium entry. We examined the activation and regulation of calcium release-activated calcium current (I crac) in RBL-1 cells in response to various Ca2+ store-depleting agents. With [Ca2+] i strongly buffered to 100 nm,I crac was activated by ionomycin, thapsigargin, inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3), and two metabolically stable IP3 receptor agonists, adenophostin A andl-α-glycerophospho-d-myoinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (GPIP2). With minimal [Ca2+] i buffering, with [Ca2+] i free to fluctuateI crac was activated by ionomycin, thapsigargin, and by the potent IP3 receptor agonist, adenophostin A, but not by GPIP2 or IP3 itself. Likewise, when [Ca2+] i was strongly buffered to 500 nm, ionomycin, thapsigargin, and adenophostin A did and GPIP2 and IP3 did not activate detectableI crac. However, with minimal [Ca2+] i buffering, or with [Ca2+] i buffered to 500 nm, GPIP2 was able to fully activate detectableI crac if uptake of Ca2+intracellular stores was first inhibited. Our findings suggest that when IP3 activates the IP3 receptor, the resulting influx of Ca2+ quickly inactivates the receptor, and Ca2+ is re-accumulated at sites that regulateI crac. Adenophostin A, by virtue of its high receptor affinity, is resistant to this inactivation. Comparison of thapsigargin-releasable Ca2+ pools following activation by different IP3 receptor agonists indicates that the critical regulatory pool of Ca2+ may be very small in comparison to the total IP3-sensitive component of the endoplasmic reticulum. These findings reveal new and important roles for IP3 receptors located on discrete IP3-sensitive Ca2+ pools in calcium feedback regulation ofI crac and capacitative calcium entry. inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate Ca2+ release-activated Ca2+ current 1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid l-α-glycerophospho-d-myo-inositol-4,5-bisphosphate HEPES-buffered saline solution Many extracellular stimuli act through cell surface receptors to promote generation of intracellular inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3)1 and consequently release intracellular Ca2+ stores (1Berridge M.J. Nature. 1993; 361: 315-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (6174) Google Scholar). The release of stored Ca2+ is commonly accompanied by influx of Ca2+ from the extracellular space, through the “capacitative Ca2+ entry” pathway (2Putney Jr., J.W. Cell Calcium. 1986; 7: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (2109) Google Scholar, 3Putney Jr., J.W. Cell Calcium. 1990; 11: 611-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (1261) Google Scholar, 4Putney Jr., J.W. Capacitative Calcium Entry. Landes Biomedical Publishing, Austin, TX1997Crossref Google Scholar). Although depletion of intracellular stores and activation of capacitative calcium entry are inextricably linked, the underlying mechanism remains poorly defined (4Putney Jr., J.W. Capacitative Calcium Entry. Landes Biomedical Publishing, Austin, TX1997Crossref Google Scholar). Store-operated currents, which are proposed to mediate capacitative calcium entry, have been measured in various cell types (5Parekh A.B. Penner R. Physiol. Rev. 1997; 77: 901-930Crossref PubMed Scopus (1291) Google Scholar). To date, “Ca2+ release-activated Ca2+ current” (I crac) is the best defined member of the store-operated current family (6Hoth M. Penner R. Nature. 1992; 355: 353-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (1491) Google Scholar). I crac, measured in mast cells, T-lymphocytes, and rat basophilic leukemia (RBL-1) cells is both highly selective for Ca2+ as the permeant ion and strongly inhibited by Ca2+ feedback (5Parekh A.B. Penner R. Physiol. Rev. 1997; 77: 901-930Crossref PubMed Scopus (1291) Google Scholar,7Zweifach A. Lewis R.S. J. Gen. Physiol. 1995; 105: 209-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar, 8Zweifach A. Lewis R.S. J. Biol.

At least two forms of Ca2+-dependent inactivation of I crac have been reported, termed fast and slow inactivation. Fast inactivation occurs on a sub-second time scale and is caused by increases in sub-plasmalemmal Ca2+ concentration in the vicinity of the Ca2+channel (7Zweifach A. Lewis R.S. J. Gen. Physiol. 1995; 105: 209-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar, 9Hoth M. Penner R. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1993; 465: 359-386Crossref Scopus (661) Google Scholar). Slow inactivation, on the time scale of tens to hundreds of seconds, is caused by increases in the bulk cytosolic [Ca2+] and is partly dependent on refilling of intracellular Ca2+ stores (8Zweifach A. Lewis R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14445-14451Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). In order to maximize, or indeed detect, the typically small whole-cell CRAC currents, it is necessary to minimize these forms of Ca2+ feedback. First, the [Ca2+] i is tightly buffered to basal levels with high concentrations of Ca2+ chelators such as BAPTA or EGTA. Second, the cell membrane potential is held at depolarized levels to decrease the driving force for Ca2+ entry between current measurements. A major disadvantage of these conditions is the inability to measure simultaneous changes in [Ca2+] i . Recently, simultaneous measurements of [Ca2+] i and I crac have been reported in RBL-1 cells, an immortalized mast cell line (10Huang Y. Takahashi M. Tanzawa K. Putney Jr., J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31815-31821Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). In this study, the degree of Ca2+ buffering was reduced from a level which effectively clamps [Ca2+] i to basal concentrations, to a minimal level, which permitted fluctuations of [Ca2+] i. Under these conditions, adenophostin A, an IP3 receptor agonist with 100-fold higher affinity for the IP3 receptor compared with the native ligand IP3 (11Takahashi M. Tanzawa K. Takahashi S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 369-372Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) induced Ca2+ release and activation ofI crac (10Huang Y. Takahashi M. Tanzawa K. Putney Jr., J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31815-31821Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Several other agents that would be expected to deplete intracellular stores, including analogues of IP3 ((2,4,5)IP3, 3-deoxy-3-fluoro-IP3), thapsigargin (a SERCA inhibitor), and ionomycin (a Ca2+ ionophore), did not activateI crac under these conditions. It was suggested that the unique ability of adenophostin A to activateI crac was perhaps due to action at the level of Ca2+-dependent inactivation of the CRAC channel. In the present study we investigated activation ofI crac in RBL-1 cells under conditions of weak Ca2+ buffering, while simultaneously monitoring [Ca2+] i. We compared the ability of various store depletion agents and combinations of these agents to induce a rise in [Ca2+] i and to activate detectableI crac. We now find that adenophostin A, thapsigargin, and ionomycin all activate I cracunder low buffering conditions; however, IP3 and a stable analogue of IP3,l-α-glycerophospho-d-myoinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (GPIP2), do not. This failure was not the result of Ca2+ feedback on the CRAC channel. Rather, deactivation of the current appears due to inactivation of IP3 receptors and rapid refilling of critical Ca2+ stores thereby diminishing the signal for activation of I crac. This work reveals a new mechanism that involves the IP3receptor for Ca2+ feedback on I crac. These IP3 receptors are likely located in spatially restricted regions within the endoplasmic reticulum and are closely coupled to activation and regulation ofI crac. Rat basophilic leukemia cells (RBL-1) were purchased from the ATCC (1378-CRL). Cells were cultured in Earle's minimal essential medium with Earle's salts, 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mml-glutamine, 50 units/ml penicillin, and 50 mg/ml streptomycin (37 °C, 5% CO2). For experiments, cells were passaged onto glass coverslips (number 11/2) and used 12 -36 h after plating. Coverslips with attached cells were mounted in a Teflon chamber and incubated at room temperature for 25 min in HEPES-buffered saline solution (HBSS; in mm, 140 NaCl, 4.7 KCl, 10 CsCl, 1.8 CaCl2, 1.13 MgCl2, 10 glucose, and 10 HEPES, pH 7.2) containing 1 μm Fura-2 AM (Molecular Probes). Cells were then washed and bathed in HBSS for at least 10 min before Ca2+measurements were made. Fluorescence was monitored by placing the Teflon chamber with the coverslip of Fura-2-loaded cells onto the stage of a Nikon Diaphot microscope (40× Neofluor objective). Cells were excited by light (340 and 380 nm) from a Deltascan D101 (Photon Technology International Ltd.) light source equipped with a light path chopper and dual excitation monochromators. Emitted fluorescence (510 nm) was collected by a photomultiplier tube (Omega). All experiments were conducted at room temperature (22 °C). Calibration of [Ca2+] i was performed by reference to a look-up table created from Ca2+ standards supplied by Molecular Probes. Patch clamp experiments were conducted in the standard whole-cell recording configuration (12Hamill O.P. Marty A. Neher E. Sakmann B. Sigworth F.J. Pfluegers Arch. 1981; 391: 85-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (15145) Google Scholar). Patch pipette (2–4 megaohm, Corning glass, 7052) solutions contained (in mm) 140 cesium aspartate, 2 MgCl2, 10 HEPES, 1 MgATP, and either 10 BAPTA-Cs4 (with free Ca2+set to 100 or 500 nm, calculated using MaxChelator software (version 6.60) or 0.1 BAPTA-Cs4 (with no Ca2+added), pH 7.2. Fura-2 free acid (50 μm) was included in the pipette as indicated. Bath solution (HBSS) was as described above, except CaCl2 was increased to 10 mm for Ca2+-HBSS or omitted for nominally Ca2+-free HBSS (10 mm MgCl2 was included in nominally Ca2+-free HBSS). 0.2 mm EGTA was included where indicated. In all experiments, upon forming the whole-cell configuration the cell membrane potential was held at +30 mV (to minimize Ca2+entry and Ca2+-dependent inactivation of CRAC channels). Periodically (once every 5 s) the membrane potential was stepped to −100 mV (for 20 ms to assessI crac), and then a voltage ramp to +60 mV, over a period of 160 ms, was applied. Currents are normalized to cell capacitance. All voltages are corrected for a 10 mV liquid-junction potential. Membrane currents were amplified with an Axopatch-1C amplifier (Axon Instruments, Burlingham, CA). Voltage clamp protocols were implemented and data acquisition performed with PCLAMP 6.1 software (Axon Instruments). Currents were filtered at 1 kHz and digitized at 200-μs intervals. Adenophostin A was a gift from Drs. M. Takahashi and K. Tanzawa (Sankyo Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan). IP3 and ionomycin were from Calbiochem. Thapsigargin was from LC Laboratories, and GPIP2 was from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. Cs4BAPTA (1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid) and Fura-2 were from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). With pipette solutions strongly buffered (with 10 mm BAPTA) to 100 nmfree [Ca2+], and following the voltage protocol described under “Experimental Procedures,” I crac was activated by a variety of store depletion agents in agreement with previous studies (6Hoth M. Penner R. Nature. 1992; 355: 353-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (1491) Google Scholar, 9Hoth M. Penner R. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1993; 465: 359-386Crossref Scopus (661) Google Scholar, 10Huang Y.

Intracellular delivery of IP3 (20 or 40 μm), GPIP2 (100 or 200 μm), a non-metabolizable analogue of IP3, or adenophostin A (2 μm), or extracellular addition of thapsigargin (1 μm) or ionomycin (500 nm) activated an inward current with properties characteristic of I crac. In each case, the current decreased rapidly upon removal of extracellular Ca2+ (Fig. 1 B), showed inward rectification, and reversed direction at a potential positive of +30 mV (Fig.1 A). There were no significant differences among the maximum amplitudes of the currents activated by these agents (Fig.1 C). The development times were also similar, although slightly prolonged for thapsigargin (Fig. 1 C; complete time course of I crac activation with 10 mm BAPTA, 100 nm [Ca2+] i is shown by the open circles in Fig. 3).Figure 3Adenophostin A, thapsigargin, and ionomycin, but not IP3 and GPIP2 ,activate I crac when [Ca2+] i is strongly buffered to activated levels (500 nm).

(n ≥ 5).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) With pipette solutions buffered with 0.1 mm BAPTA, [Ca2+] i was weakly buffered and free to fluctuate. Under these conditions, each of the store-depleting agents caused an increase in [Ca2+] i in Fura-2-loaded cells (Fig. 2, A–E upper traces). Adenophostin A (Fig. 2 A), IP3 (Fig. 2 B), and GPIP2 (Fig.2 C) each produced a biphasic increase in [Ca2+] i as follows: first a peak then a lower plateau, sustained slightly but significantly above basal levels. Thapsigargin (Fig. 2 D) and ionomycin (Fig. 2 E), agents that bypass the IP3 receptor, produced sustained and monophasic increases in [Ca2+] i. Importantly, all the sustained increases in Ca2+ were reversed by removal of extracellular Ca2+ and therefore reflected Ca2+entry. Ca2+ entry presumably occurs mostly during the brief hyperpolarizing pulses. In support of this idea, expansion of the Ca2+ traces revealed episodic Ca2+ peaks, with a 5-s periodicity, that correspond to membrane hyperpolarizations. These Ca2+ peaks were absent when extracellular Ca2+ was removed (data now shown). Simultaneous measurements of membrane currents in the same Fura-2-loaded cells revealed that adenophostin A, thapsigargin, and ionomycin, but neither IP3 nor GPIP2, induced detectable activation of I crac (Fig. 2,A–E, lower traces). The currents activated by adenophostin A (Fig. 2 A), thapsigargin (Fig. 2 D), and ionomycin (Fig. 2 E) in weakly Ca2+-buffered cells displayed properties characteristic ofI crac. In each case, the current decreased rapidly upon removal of extracellular Ca2+. The currents also showed inward rectification and reversed direction at a potential positive of +30 mV (not shown). Under these conditions adenophostin A (1.08 ± 0.12 pA/pF), thapsigargin (1.05 ± 0.14 pA/pF), and ionomycin (1.29 ± 0.13 pA/pF) caused similar increases in I crac(Fig. 2 F), but all of the values were significantly less than those measured with strong Ca2+ buffering (Fig.1 C), being 45 ± 5, 43 ± 6, and 46 ± 3%, respectively. Following break in with pipettes containing adenophostin A, or following application of ionomycin, activation ofI crac occurred after short delays of 49 ± 11 and 88 ± 9 s, respectively (Fig. 2, A andE). However, there was a considerably longer delay between the delivery of thapsigargin and subsequent activation ofI crac (181 ± 19 s) (Fig.2 D). I crac was activated by thapsigargin with a mean development time (time from the initial increase in current to development of current; see Ref. 13Huang Y. Putney Jr., J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19554-19559Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar)) of 375 ± 35 s, considerably slower than that for adenophostin A (132 ± 25 s) or ionomycin (145 ± 22 s) (Fig.2 F, open bars). The initial rise in Ca2+ induced by thapsigargin indicates blockade of endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPases and the subsequent leak of Ca2+ from intracellular stores. The delay before detectable I crac activation and the slow time course of development presumably reflect the time it takes to empty, to the necessary degree, the stores linked to I cracactivation. It is because of this delayed and slow activation ofI crac with thapsigargin that our earlier study failed to detect activation of I crac by thapsigargin in RBL-1 cells (10Huang Y. Takahashi M. Tanzawa K. Putney Jr., J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31815-31821Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Also, in our earlier study (10Huang Y. Takahashi M. Tanzawa K. Putney Jr., J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31815-31821Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) ionomycin failed to activate I crac. However, a substantially higher concentration of ionomycin was used (5 μm, as opposed to 500 nm in the current study), and at this concentration ionomycin raises [Ca2+] i to extremely high levels, in excess of 1 μm, which likely caused a strong Ca2+-dependent inactivation ofI crac. We next considered how minimal Ca2+ buffering might prevent IP3 and GPIP2 from activating detectableI crac. Direct effects of global [Ca2+] i on CRAC channels is unlikely to be responsible, because the agents that activatedI crac actually raised steady-state [Ca2+] i to somewhat higher levels than did IP3 or GPIP2. Thus, either IP3 and GPIP2 are capable of raising Ca2+ to higher levels than other agents in small, discrete regions close to the CRAC channels or, alternatively, I crac activated by IP3 and GPIP2 is for some reason more sensitive to Ca2+ inhibition. Thus, we studied the effect of increased cytosolic Ca2+ on I cracunder conditions whereby both sub-plasmalemmal and global [Ca2+] i were strongly buffered with 10 mm BAPTA. We buffered [Ca2+] i to either a basal value ([Ca2+] i ∼100 nm) or a value ([Ca2+] i ∼500 nm) similar to that recorded in weakly buffered cells after activation with store depletion agents (Fig. 2 E). Under these conditions (10 mm BAPTA, [Ca2+] i ∼500 nm), adenophostin A (Fig. 3 A), thapsigargin (Fig.3 D), and ionomycin (Fig. 3 E) activatedI crac; IP3 (Fig. 3 B) and GPIP2 (Fig. 3 C) did not. Thus, IP3and GPIP2 apparently fail to activateI crac because with these agents the signaling mechanism is more sensitive to inhibition by elevated [Ca2+] i . Adenophostin A (2.18 ± 0.03 pA/pF), thapsigargin (2.57 ± 0.65 pA/pF), and ionomycin (2.95 ± 0.45 pA/pF) caused similar increases in I crac. These values were also similar to measurements made with free Ca2+ buffered to 100 nm (Fig. 1 C), being 90 ± 3, 104 ± 26, and 105 ± 20%, respectively. It is worth noting, however, that although the peak magnitude of I cracmeasured with free Ca2+ set to 100 or 500 nmwas similar, a slow inactivation of the current was prominent at the higher cytosolic [Ca2+]. I cracactivated by adenophostin A fell to 90 ± 12 and 56 ± 9% of the peak after 300 s, at 100 and 500 nm free Ca2+, respectively. Over the same period,I crac activated by ionomycin also declined more at 500 nm, falling to 62 ± 9% of the peak compared with 87 ± 11% with 100 nm free Ca2+. The mean development time of I crac for thapsigargin at 500 nm [Ca2+] i (415 ± 27 s) was again much slower than for adenophostin A (94 ± 8 s) and ionomycin (68 ± 5 s). There was also a considerable delay before thapsigargin induced detectable activation of I crac (295 ± 34 s) compared to when free [Ca2+] i was set to 100 nm (91 ± 14 s) (Fig. 3 D). For both adenophostin A and ionomycin, activation ofI crac was seen after only a short delay (42 ± 12 and 88 ± 9 s, respectively). Buffering sub-plasmalemmal [Ca2+] gradients (10 mm BAPTA), and raising bulk cytosolic [Ca2+] (500 nm), mimicked some of the effects of low Ca2+ buffering, namely failure of GPIP2and IP3 to activate I crac and slow activation of I crac by thapsigargin. Given that adenophostin A, ionomycin, and thapsigargin all activateI crac under conditions where IP3 and GPIP2 are ineffective, direct Ca2+-dependent inactivation of the CRAC channel seems unlikely to be the cause. Rather, an involvement of the IP3 receptor itself would be indicated. Thus,I crac could be inactivated if, when IP3 and GPIP2 are used, the IP3receptors were desensitized, and as a result the stores signalingI crac activation were refilled. Increases in [Ca2+] i are known to promote dissociation of IP3 from the IP3 receptor leading to faster IP3 receptor inactivation (14Hannaert-Merah Z. Coquil J.-F. Combettes L. Claret M. Mauger J.-P. Champeil P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29642-29649Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Adenophostin A, by virtue of its high affinity for the IP3 receptor, may be less susceptible to this increased rate of dissociation. Adenophostin A would therefore prolong IP3 receptor activation, relative to the lower affinity agonists (GPIP2 and IP3), and maintain depleted Ca2+ stores. If indeed IP3 receptor inactivation does lead to rapid store refilling and turns off detectable I crac, then prevention of Ca2+ re-uptake (with thapsigargin) should prevent the re-uptake of Ca2+ that occurs with IP3 and GPIP2, and thus these agents would act more like adenophostin A. To test this hypothesis, thapsigargin was applied to cells loaded with Fura-2 and patch-clamped in the cell-attached mode (Fig. 4 A). Patch pipettes contained 100 μm GPIP2 and 0.1 mm BAPTA. After 50–70 s, a slight increase in [Ca2+] i was detected indicating SERCA inhibition (Fig. 4 A, upper trace). The whole-cell mode was then established in order to deliver GPIP2 and measureI crac (Fig. 4 A, lower trace). GPIP2 caused a further, more substantial increase in [Ca2+] i which was sustained (compare with GPIP2 alone, Fig. 2 C). Importantly, the increase in [Ca2+] i that occurred upon delivery of GPIP2 was accompanied by rapid activation ofI crac. I crac was activated after only a short delay (33 ± 8 s) and with a time course of 86 ± 14 s. Had the current been activated by thapsigargin alone, the delay from break-in would have been in excess of 3 min and the development time in excess of 5 min (inferred from Fig. 2 D). Development of I crac in the presence of GPIP2 is therefore triggered by the rapid release of Ca2+ through activated IP3 receptors and independent of the slow leak of Ca2+ induced by thapsigargin alone. The peak amplitude of I cracwas not significantly altered by the presence (1.53 ± 0.23 pA/pF) or absence of GPIP2 (1.05 ± 0.14 pA/pF, Fig.2 F). 2Although the mean value for the current in the presence of GPIP2 and thapsigargin was almost 50% larger than that for thapsigargin alone, the difference was not statistically significant by either t test or analysis of variance, owing to the variability in values of I crac from one preparation to another. However, we note that the value for GPIP2 plus thapsigargin (1.53 ± 0.23 pA/pF) was similar to the value for ionomycin under the same conditions (1.29 ± 0.13 pA/pF). This suggests that if GPIP2 plus thapsigargin does induce a current larger than for thapsigargin alone, it is likely due to increased release of Ca2+ rather than a specific effect of GPIP2 on the channel activation mechanism. This is to be expected if GPIP2 increases the rate of release, through opening IP3 receptors, but not the overall extent. The preceding data suggest that when Ca2+ is free to increase, re-uptake of Ca2+ prevents detectable activation of I crac by GPIP2. If this assumption is correct, then delivery of thapsigargin before GPIP2, with Ca2+ clamped to 500 nmwith 10 mm BAPTA, should also allow rapid activation ofI crac (Fig. 4 B). As predicted, in cells pretreated with thapsigargin for 50–70 s, delivery of GPIP2 led to a rapid activation ofI crac. Activation was detected after only a short delay (34 ± 11 s) and had a development time of 81 ± 13 s, compared with 415 ± 27 s for thapsigargin alone. The amplitude of the current induced by GPIP2 and thapsigargin combined (3.16 ± 0.28 pA/pF) was once again not significantly greater than that that seen with thapsigargin alone (2.57 ± 0.65 pA/pF). These results reveal that SERCA pumps need to be blocked if GPIP2 is to activate detectableI crac when [Ca2+] i is weakly buffered. Refilling of stores by SERCA pumps must occur very quickly, and therefore, a decrease in IP3 receptor activity must also occur quickly to explain the complete lack of detectableI crac activation by GPIP2 or IP3. GPIP2 is successful in activatingI crac after thapsigargin addition because despite rapid IP3 receptor desensitization, Ca2+ cannot be re-accumulated into the critical stores. This predicts that if the addition of the SERCA inhibitor is delayed for even a short interval following addition of GPIP2,I crac activation will still fail. As shown in Fig. 4 C, this is indeed the case. When thapsigargin was added 50–70 s after break-in with GPIP2, no rapid activation of I crac was observed; ratherI crac activation occurred slowly (311 ± 7 s) and after a latency of 222 ± 21 s, similar to activation of I crac by thapsigargin alone (see Fig. 2 D). Collectively these results indicate that IP3 and GPIP2 activate IP3 receptors and allow a rapid release of Ca2+ from intracellular stores, but this receptor activity and enhanced Ca2+ release are transient. Hence, when re-uptake of Ca2+ is blocked prior to GPIP2 exposure, the release induced by GPIP2 is sufficiently sustained to activate I crac rapidly (Fig. 4 A). However, if Ca2+ re-uptake is allowed to proceed for even a minute after GPIP2 delivery, blockade of SERCA pumps at this stage does not rapidly activateI crac, because the IP3 receptors have already desensitized and Ca2+ has been re-accumulated (Fig. 4 C). Finally, therefore, we attempted experiments designed to demonstrate more directly the re-uptake of Ca2+into pools regulating I crac and to determine their size relative to the presumably larger IP3- and thapsigargin-sensitive stores. To this end, we activated signaling in cells with either GPIP2 or adenophostin A, and we examined the size of the [Ca2+] i signal on application of thapsigargin in Ca2+-free media (Fig.5, lower panels). On delivery of adenophostin A or GPIP2, cells were exposed to either Ca2+-free or Ca2+-containing media before assessing the thapsigargin-sensitive store content in order to determine the contribution of Ca2+ influx to the content of the stores. A residual, thapsigargin-sensitive, Ca2+ store was detected in cells after exposure to adenophostin A (Fig.5 A) or GPIP2 (Fig. 5 B) in the absence of Ca2+ influx (dotted lines). When Ca2+ influx was allowed before store assessment (dashed lines), some refilling of stores occurred after both agents, although slightly more refilling appeared to occur in the presence of GPIP2. In each case, however, Ca2+stores were not completely refilled, because control cells exposed only to thapsigargin showed the largest release of Ca2+(solid lines). Assessment of the Ca2+ stores by inhibition of SERCA pumps revealed Ca2+ release kinetics for adenophostin A (Fig.5 A, dashed lines) which were distinct from that in control cells (Fig. 5, solid line) or GPIP2-treated cells (Fig. 5 B, dashed lines). For adenophostin A-treated cells, the rate of Ca2+ release was faster than in control cells, with [Ca2+] i returning to base line within 514 ± 31 s, compared with 1058 ± 60 and 966 ± 92 s for control or GPIP2-treated cells, respectively. This finding fits with our prediction that, in the presence of adenophostin A, IP3 receptors remain more active and this maintains critical stores depleted andI crac-detectable. GPIP2 did not significantly increase the kinetics of Ca2+ release over that in control cells, suggesting minimal residual activation of IP3 receptors. Although the residual Ca2+ store was similar in cells treated with adenophostin A or GPIP2, simultaneous current measurements revealed I crac activation in response to adenophostin A only (Fig. 5, upper panels). This indicates that the pool of Ca2+ involved in controllingI"

Mad:Max heterodimers repress transcription by recruiting a large multi-protein complex containing the histone deacetylases, HDAC1 and HDAC2, to DNA. The interaction between Mad proteins and HDAC1/2 is mediated by the corepressor mSin3A and requires sequences at the amino terminus of the Mad proteins, termed the SID, for Sin3interaction domain, and the second of fourpaired amphipathic α-helices (PAH2) in mSin3A. To better understand the requirements for the interaction between the SID and PAH2, we have performed mutagenesis and structural studies on the SID. These studies show that amino acids 8–20 of Mad1 are sufficient for SID:PAH2 interaction. Further, this minimal 13-residue SID peptide forms an amphipathic α-helix in solution, and residues on the hydrophobic face of the SID helix are required for interaction with PAH2. Finally, the minimal SID can function as an autonomous and portable repression domain, demonstrating that it is sufficient to target a functional mSin3A/HDAC corepressor complex.

Molecular connections between proteins in these molecular machines, and the structural basis of their assembly, are not well understood. Initially, transcription repression domains were defined by structure/function analysis, which revealed that, like activation domains, they are more likely to contain particular amino acids rather than have easily identifiable protein-protein interaction domains. This finding led to the hypothesis that activation and repression domains share similar molecular targets and that the structure of the activation or repression domain in itself was not required for function. Transcriptional repressors function by at least three distinct mechanisms: by direct contact with components of the basal transcriptional machinery, e.g. even-skipped (6Um M. Li C. Manley J.L. Mol.

Cell. 1997; 89: 365-371Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar). In each of these cases, little or no structural data are available for the repression domain. In contrast, one theme that has emerged recently from the study of activation domains is that relatively short stretches of amino acids can adopt amphipathic α-helical structures and mediate stable functional interactions between transcriptional activators and coactivators (18Kussie P.H.

Science. 1997; 277: 1310-1313Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). Reversible acetylation of the amino-terminal tails of core histones plays an important role in the regulation of gene expression. In general, regions of chromatin that are hyperacetylated are transcriptionally active, while hypoacetylated regions are silenced (21Grunstein M. Nature. 1997; 389: 349-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (2419) Google Scholar). The recent discovery that several transcriptional co-activators are histone acetyltransferases and that co-repressor complexes contain histone deacetylases as active components has provided a mechanistic basis for this correlation (22Wolffe A.P. Pruss D. Cell. 1996; 84: 817-819Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar, 23Hassig C.A. Schreiber S.L. Curr. Opin. Chem.

Lawrence Q.A. Eisenman R.N. Cell. 1995; 80: 767-776Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (526) Google Scholar, 28Schreiber-Agus N. Chin L. Chen K. Torres R. Rao G. Guida P. Skoultchi A.I. DePinho R.A. Cell. 1995; 80: 777-786Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar). mSin3A has recently been shown to be a component of a large multi-protein complex(s) that also contains the histone deacetylases HDAC11 and HDAC2 in apparently stoichiometric amounts. The enzymatic activities of the mSin3A-bound HDACs are required for full transcriptional repression by the Mad family proteins (9Hassig C.A. Fleischer T.C. Billin A.N. Schreiber S.L. Ayer D.E.

Subsequently, the mSin3A·HDAC complex has been implicated as a corepressor utilized by a diverse and rapidly expanding collection of transcriptional repressors, including RXR, MeCP2, estrogen receptor, RPX, and Pit1 (14Jones P.L.

Lawrence Q.A. Eisenman R.N. Cell. 1995; 80: 767-776Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (526) Google Scholar,33Wang H. Clark I. Nicholson P.R. Herskowitz I. Stillman D.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 5927-5936Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). These regions, termed PAH domains for pairedamphipathic α-helix, were originally proposed to function as protein-protein interaction domains (33Wang H. Clark I. Nicholson P.R. Herskowitz I. Stillman D.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 5927-5936Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Recent experiments have demonstrated this to be the case. For example, Mad proteins interact with PAH2 (27Ayer D.E. Lawrence Q.A. Eisenman R.N. Cell. 1995; 80: 767-776Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (526) Google Scholar, 28Schreiber-Agus N. Chin L.

The four PAH domains of the different Sin3 proteins are highly conserved. For example, PAH2 is 90% similar between mSin3A and mSin3B and it is approximately 70% similar to the PAH2 domain of S. cerevisiae SIN3 (27Ayer D.E. Lawrence Q.A. Eisenman R.N. Cell. 1995; 80: 767-776Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (526) Google Scholar) and recently identified SIN3 homologues fromSchizosaccharomyces pombe, Caenorhabditis elegans, Drosophila melanogaster, and Arabidopsis thaliana (data not shown). Within a given protein, the four PAH domains are roughly 45% similar with the hydrophobic positions of the putative amphipathic α-helices being most highly conserved, suggesting that PAH domains may share structural features (27Ayer D.E. Lawrence Q.A. Eisenman R.N. Cell. 1995; 80: 767-776Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (526) Google Scholar). With the exception of the Mad family, the domains required for SIN3 binding of the other SIN3 interacting proteins, SAP30, SAP18, N-CoR, UME6, HDAC1, and HDAC2, etc., share no obvious sequence similarity (data not shown). The Mad family of basic region-helix-loop-helix-leucine zipper (bHLHZip) proteins functions as transcriptional repressors and antagonize the transcriptional and transforming activity of the Myc proto-oncogenes (35Ayer D.E.

Cell. 1993; 72: 211-222Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (623) Google Scholar, 38Hurlin P.J. Queva C. Koskinen P.J. Steingrimsson E. Ayer D.E. Copeland N.G. Jenkins N.A. Eisenman R.N.

These proteins share extensive sequence homology throughout their entire open reading frames, with the highest degree of conservation within the bHLHZip and for mSin3 interaction domains (SID) (38Hurlin P.J.

The bHLHZip domain is required for dimerization with the bHLHZip protein Max and DNA binding, while the SID is required for interaction with mSin3A or mSin3B (28Schreiber-Agus N. Chin L. Chen K. Torres R. Rao G. Guida P. Skoultchi A.I. DePinho R.A. Cell. 1995; 80: 777-786Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar, 35Ayer D.E. Kretzner L. Eisenman R.N.

EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5646-5659Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). This SID sequence from Mad1 has been modeled as an amphipathic α-helix (27Ayer D.E. Lawrence Q.A. Eisenman R.N. Cell. 1995; 80: 767-776Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (526) Google Scholar). Recently, another bHLHZip protein termed Mnt, which shares homology to the Mad family within these two regions, has been identified. Mnt also interacts with Max and can repress transcription in a mSin3-dependent manner and therefore appears to be functionally equivalent to the Mad family proteins (41Hurlin P.J. Queva C. Eisenman R.N. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 44-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). Several lines of experimental evidence suggest that interaction between the Mad proteins and Mnt and mSin3A or mSin3B is critical for their function as transcriptional repressors. Mad1 proteins with point mutations in the SID no longer repress transcription, block Myc+Ras cotransformation, or arrest cells in the G1 phase of the cell cycle (27Ayer D.E. Lawrence Q.A. Eisenman R.N. Cell. 1995; 80: 767-776Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (526) Google Scholar, 36Koskinen P.J. Ayer D.E. Eisenman R.N.

Similarly, deletions of amino-terminal regions that contain the SID in Mad3, Mad4, and Mnt severely affect their biological function (38Hurlin P.J. Queva C. Koskinen P.J. Steingrimsson E. Ayer D.E.

Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 44-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). Finally, Mxi1 is encoded by two alternatively spliced mRNAs, only one of which encodes a Mxi1 protein with a SID. This protein, Mxi1-SR is much more potent at blocking Myc+Ras cotransformation than is an Mxi1 isoform which lacks a SID (28Schreiber-Agus N. Chin L. Chen K. Torres R. Rao G. Guida P. Skoultchi A.I. DePinho R.A. Cell. 1995; 80: 777-786Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar). In order to better understand the interaction between Mad family members and their corepressor mSin3A we have delineated the minimal functional SID, determined key contact residues required for interaction with PAH2 and demonstrated that the minimal SID domain is helical in solution. Fusions to the LexA DNA binding domain were made either by polymerase chain reaction amplifying SID 1–57 and SID 1–27 using pSPMad1 or pSPMad1(L12P/A16P) (27Ayer D.E. Lawrence Q.A. Eisenman R.N. Cell. 1995; 80: 767-776Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (526) Google Scholar) as template or by inserting a double-stranded oligonucleotide cassette encoding the various SID constructs between the EcoRI andBamHI sites of pBTM116 (43Hollenberg S.M. Sternglanz R. Cheng P.F. Weintraub H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3813-3822Crossref PubMed Scopus (585) Google Scholar). Each construct was verified by sequencing. The different LexA fusion constructs and VP16PAH2 (27Ayer D.E. Lawrence Q.A. Eisenman R.N. Cell. 1995; 80: 767-776Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (526) Google Scholar) were introduced into the S. cerevisiae strain L40 by lithium acetate transformation (44.Google Scholar). Quantitative β-galactosidase assays were performed from three independent colonies in triplicate from liquid cultures (44.Google Scholar). For each measurement the standard deviation was less than 10%. 293 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% defined calf serum (HyClone). 2 × 105 cells were plated on 60-mm dishes and transfected with 200 ng of the GAL4–14D luciferase reporter (45Ayer D.E. Laherty C.D. Lawrence Q.A. Armstrong A. Eisenman R.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5772-5781Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar) and 1 μg of the indicated expression vector. Cells were harvested 24 h after transfection and luciferase and β-galactosidase activity measured according to the manufacturers' protocols (Promega and Tropix). Each transfection was performed at least twice in triplicate. Error shown is the standard of the mean. The four SID-containing peptides were synthesized and purified by the Huntsman Cancer Institute DNA/Peptide Resource Core Facility. Each peptide includes residues 7–20 of human Mad1. The sequence of the wild type SID peptide is GGGMNIQMLLEAADYLE. The sequence of the double mutant L12P/A16P SID is GGGMNIQMPLEAPDYLE. The sequences of the two single mutant peptides A15D SID and L19D SID are GGGMNIQMLLEDADYLE and GGGMNIQMLLEAADYDE, respectively. Peptide concentrations were determined by measuring the absorbance of the peptide at 280 nm and using the extinction coefficient for a single tyrosine of 1.49 × 103m−1cm−1. CD samples contained 50 μm of peptide, 1× phosphate-buffered saline, and the percentage of trifluoroethanol (TFE, Sigma) indicated in Fig. 4. CD spectra were collected on an Aviv 62DS spectrophotometer from 280 to 195 nm at 25 °C using a cell with a 0.1-cm pathlength. The reported spectra are the average of 15 consecutive runs. The observed ellipticity was converted to mean residue molar ellipticity [θ] (deg cm2 dmol−1) using the relationship [θ]=θ/(Cr l) where θ is the observed ellipticity, l is the pathlength, andCr is the mean residue molar concentration. Fractional helicities were calculated as described using values for [θ]0222 and [θ]100222, corresponding to 0% and 100% helical content at 222 nm, of −2000 and −28,400 deg cm2dmol−1, respectively (46Wu C.S.

Ni2+-NTA agarose (Qiagen) was blocked with rabbit reticulocyte lysate (diluted 1:3 in PBS) for 30 min at 4 °C and then incubated with the in vitro synthesized Mad1His and Mad1(L12P/A16P)His for 30 min at 4 °C in PBS (native) or 6 m guanidine hydrochloride, 0.1m NaH2PO4, and 0.01 mTris, pH 8.0 (denaturing conditions) followed by extensive washing with the same buffers. The bound proteins were eluted in PBS containing 0.5m imidazole and then dialyzed overnight against PBS to remove the imidazole and allow for renaturation. Recombinant GST and GST-PAH2 were expressed in bacteria and purified on glutathione-Sepharose 4B (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The blots were prepared by resolving 1 μg of GST and 1 μg of GST-PAH2 on 15% SDS-PAGE, followed by transfer to PVDF membrane. The blots were blocked in far Western buffer (PBS containing 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm EDTA, and 1 mm dithiothreitol) containing 5% nonfat dry milk for 1 h at 4 °C. Purified probes were added to blots in 5 ml of far Western buffer containing 1% nonfat dry milk and incubated together at 4 °C overnight with rocking. Following washing with far Western buffer, the blots were air-dried and exposed 48 h for autoradiography. We wished to determine the structural requirements for the interaction between mSin3A and Mad1. However, it has not been conclusively demonstrated that the interaction between the two proteins is direct. For example, the interaction between Mad1 and mSin3A has been detected using the two-hybrid assay,in vitro translated proteins, and co-immunoprecipitation from cell extracts containing epitope-tagged Mad1 (10Laherty C.D. Yang W.M. Sun J.M. Davie J.R. Seto E. Eisenman R.N. Cell. 1997; 89: 349-356Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (851) Google Scholar, 27Ayer D.E. Lawrence Q.A. Eisenman R.N.

Cell. 1995; 80: 777-786Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar). While these experiments suggest that the interaction between Mad1 and mSin3A is direct, they do not rule out the possibility that a bridging factor could mediate the interaction between Mad1 and mSin3A. To determine whether the interaction between Mad1 and mSin3A is direct, we used far Western blot assays. In these experiments GST-PAH2, a GST fusion to the PAH2 domain of mSin3A, and GST alone were resolved by SDS-PAGE followed by transfer to a PVDF membrane. Duplicate blots were probed with 35S-labeled in vitro transcribed and translated Mad1His and mutant Mad1 protein, Mad1(L12P/A16P)His, that does not interact with mSin3A. Equal efficiency of transcription and translation of these proteins was confirmed by SDS-PAGE followed by autoradiography to detect the proteins (data not shown). These protein probes were purified on Ni2+-NTA agarose under native or denaturing conditions. When purified under native conditions, Mad1His but not Mad1(L12P/A16P)His was able to interact with GST-PAH2. Neither Mad1His nor Mad1(L12P/A16P)His interacted with GST alone (Fig.1 A). Together, these results confirm that Mad1 interacts specifically with PAH2 of mSin3A and that the interaction is sensitive to mutations in the SID. However, because there is abundant mSin3A, and presumably interacting cofactors, in reticulocyte lysate (data not shown), the possibility exists that a bridging factor may have copurified with Mad1 under native conditions and that it mediated the interaction between Mad1 and PAH2. Mad1His purified under denaturing conditions and subsequently renatured also interacted with GST-PAH2 but not with GST alone (Fig. 1 B,left panel). Furthermore, Mad1(L12P/A16P)His purified under denaturing conditions did not interact with either GST or GST-PAH2 (Fig. 1 B, right panel). It is very likely that any interaction between Mad1 and a putative bridging factor would have been disrupted under the denaturing conditions used for purification. Therefore, these results indicate that the interaction between Mad1 and PAH2 of mSin3A is direct and does not require a bridging factor. Alignment of the Mad family proteins and Mnt from different species reveals that amino acids 7–35, numbering relative to Mad1, are highly conserved (Fig.2 A). Within this block of residues, the sequence LLEAA is nearly identical between the aligned molecules, suggesting that it may form the core of the interaction domain. This block of conservation is followed by a stretch of charged amino acids and the sequence EHGYAS. These downstream sequence elements are highly conserved within the mammalian Mad proteins but are absent from the Mnt proteins and an invertebrate Mad homologue. Previous mutagenesis studies in which the first 35 amino acids of Mad1 were deleted have demonstrated that this conserved amino-terminal region is necessary for interaction between Mad proteins and mSin3A (27Ayer D.E. Lawrence Q.A. Eisenman R.N. Cell. 1995; 80: 767-776Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (526) Google Scholar). Another Mad1 truncation in which the first 20 amino acids of Mad1 are deleted but leaves the EHGYAS region intact was also tested. This deletion was also unable to interact with mSin3A, indicating that the conserved EHGYAS region is not sufficient for the Mad1:mSin3A interaction (27Ayer D.E. Lawrence Q.A. Eisenman R.N. Cell. 1995; 80: 767-776Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (526) Google Scholar). Further experiments have shown that amino acids 1–35 of Mad1 mediate histone deacetylase-dependent repression (9Hassig C.A. Fleischer T.C. Billin A.N. Schreiber S.L. Ayer D.E.

However, the minimal domain required for the interaction between Mad1 and mSin3A and the role, if any, of the conserved EHGYAS region in this interaction have not been determined. We have used a directed two-hybrid assay to measure the relative affinity of the SID and various SID mutants for PAH2. Briefly, SID molecules based on the sequence of human Mad1 were fused to the DNA binding domain of bacterial LexA, and the PAH2 domain of mSin3A was fused to the transcriptional activation domain of VP16. Following introduction into the S. cerevisiae strain L40, relative affinity was measured by quantitative analysis of the β-galactosidase activity generated from an integrated LexA-dependent LacZ reporter gene. To define the minimal sequence required for interaction with PAH2, we constructed a series of amino- and carboxyl-terminal truncations of the SID. Consistent with previous findings (27Ayer D.E. Lawrence Q.A. Eisenman R.N. Cell. 1995; 80: 767-776Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (526) Google Scholar), the region from the initiating methionine to the beginning of the basic region, amino acids 1–57, was sufficient for interaction and two point mutations within the putative α-helical region of the SID, L12P/A16P, completely abolished interaction (Fig. 2 B). A carboxyl-terminal deletion of 30 amino acids, SID 1–27, which removes the conserved EHGYAS, bound PAH2 almost 2-fold better than the longer amino-terminal construct, suggesting that the EHGYAS sequence has a sl"

Indirect immunofluorescence revealed that dexamethasone induced the recruitment of endogenous Ras and the p85 regulatory subunit of phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3-kinase to regions of cell-cell contact, concurrently with the stimulation of TER. Expression of dominant-negative RasN17 abolished the dexamethasone stimulation in TER, whereas, dexamethasone induced the reorganization of tight junction and adherens junction proteins, ZO-1 and β-catenin, as well as F-actin, to precise regions of cell-cell contact in a Ras-independent manner. Confocal microscopy revealed that RasN17 and the p85 regulatory subunit of PI 3-kinase co-localized with ZO-1 and F-actin at the tight junction and adherens junction, respectively. Treatment with either of the PI 3-kinase inhibitors, wortmannin or LY294002, or the MEK inhibitor PD 098059, which prevents MAPK signaling, attenuated the dexamethasone stimulation of TER without affecting apical junction remodeling. Similar to dominant-negative RasN17, disruption of both Ras effector pathways using a combination of inhibitors abolished the glucocorticoid stimulation of TER. Thus, the glucocorticoiddependent remodeling of the apical junction and tight junction sealing can be uncoupled by their dependence on Ras and/or PI 3-kinase-dependent pathways, implicating a new role for Ras and PI 3-kinase cell signaling events in the steroid control of cell-cell interactions.

The tight junction, a specialized structure located at the apex of the junctional complex, restricts the lateral diffusion of lipids and membrane proteins, and thereby physically defines the border between the apical and basolateral compartments (1Cereijido M. Valdes J. Shoshani L. Contreras R.G. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1998; 60: 161-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Moreover, tight junctions form a regulated barrier for the diffusion of solutes through the paracellular pathway to control the microenvironment on each side of the epithelium (2Madara J.L. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1998; 60: 143-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar). Immediately basal to the tight junction is the adherens junction that is responsible for intercellular adhesion between neighboring cells, a process critical for the proper organization and physiological function of the tissue (3Gumbiner B.M. Cell. 1996; 84: 345-357Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2894) Google Scholar). Both these intercellular junctions have been proposed to associate with the perijunctional actin cytoskeleton and signaling molecules through multiprotein complexes to form an integrated functional unit. Assembly of the tight junction requires the initial engagement of cell-cell contacts at the adherens junction, a process that is mediated by the calcium-dependent intercellular adhesion between E-cadherin molecules and the formation of an intracellular protein complex that includes E-cadherin, α-catenin, β-catenin, γ-catenin (plakoglobin), and the actin cytoskeleton (4Gumbiner B. Stevenson B. Grimaldi A. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 107: 1575-1587Crossref PubMed Scopus (653) Google Scholar, 5Ozawa M. Baribault H. Kemler R. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 1711-1717Crossref PubMed Scopus (1138) Google Scholar). Activation of cadherin-mediated cell-cell adhesion triggers a series of molecular events that can lead to the recruitment of tight junction components to the points of cell-cell contact and assembly into a complex to form a functional unit capable of providing a tight paracellular seal to the epithelium (6Siliciano J.D. Goodenough D.A. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 107: 2389-2399Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). The tight junction complex consists of several classes of protein components that includes transmembrane proteins, intracellular peripheral membrane proteins, and potential cell signaling molecules. At present, 3 transmembrane protein families, occludin (7Furuse M. Hirase T. Itoh M. Nagafuchi A. Yonemura S. Tsukita S. Tsukita S. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 1777-1788Crossref PubMed Scopus (2073) Google Scholar), 8 members of the claudin family (8Furuse M. Fujita K. Hiiragi T. Fujimoto K. Tsukita S. J.

Stoppacciaro A. Ruco L. Villa A. Simmons D. Dejana E. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 117-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (1118) Google Scholar), have been identified to reside at the tight junction. Although little is known about the claudin protein family or junctional adhesion molecule, occludin is thought to provide paracellular barrier function through its extracellular domain (11Wong V. Gumbiner B.M. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 399-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar). The cytoplasmic tail of occludin interacts with a complex of related peripheral membrane proteins, ZO-1, ZO-2, and ZO-3, three members of the membrane-associated guanylate kinase (MAGUK)1 protein family (12Mitic L.L. Anderson J.M. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1998; 60: 121-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (616) Google Scholar). Each of these proteins contain three PDZ (PSD95/SAP90, discs-large, ZO-1) domains (13Ranganathan R. Ross E.M. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: R770-R773Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), a Src homology (SH3) domain, and a region similar to guanylate kinase. It has been proposed that these protein-binding modules allow MAGUK members to coordinate the localization and clustering of transmembrane and peripheral membrane proteins. In doing so, MAGUK proteins at the tight junction may provide a bridge connecting the cytoskeleton or intracellular signaling pathways to transmembrane proteins, such as occludin, thereby regulating the extracellular tight junction seal (14Anderson J.M. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 382-384Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). In this regard, several potential cell signaling molecules, such as PKC-ζ (15Dodane V. Kachar B. J. Membr. Biol. 1996; 149: 199-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar), atypical PKC isotype-specific interacting protein (16Izumi Y. Hirose T. Tamai Y. Hirai S. Nagashima Y. Fujimoto T. Tabuse Y. Kemphues K.J. Ohno S. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 95-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar), the heterotrimeric G protein subunit (17Denker B.M. Saha C. Khawaja S. Nigam S.K. J. Biol.

Although conceptually intriguing, their functional role in regulating tight junction assembly and/or permeability properties has not been characterized. The physiological plasticity and tissue-specific regulation of assembly and function of epithelial cell tight junctions implicate a complex set of signal transduction pathways that likely target and control the apical junctional complex. For example, in various cell types the permeability properties of the tight junction can be influenced by growth factors, intracellular calcium, calmodulin, protein kinase C, receptor and nonreceptor tyrosine kinases, heterotrimeric G proteins, lipid second messengers, and phospholipase C (19Balda M.S.

Regulatory proteins belonging to the Ras superfamily of small GTPases consisting of the Ras, Rho, and Rab subfamilies, which transduce intracellular signals from a variety of extracellular stimuli, have been proposed to play a role in cell-cell interactions. Recently, Rac and Rho have been shown to be critical for the establishment and maintenance of intercellular adhesion (25Braga V.M. Machesky L.M. Hall A. Hotchin N.A. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 1421-1431Crossref PubMed Scopus (650) Google Scholar, 26Takaishi K. Sasaki T. Kotani H. Nishioka H. Takai Y. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 1047-1059Crossref PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar), and have been implicated as regulators of tight junction assembly and permeability properties (27Nusrat A. Giry M. Turner J.R. Colgan S.P. Parkos C.A. Carnes D. Lemichez E. Boquet P. Madara J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10629-10633Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar, 28Jou T.S.

Rho is also involved in the sphingosine 1-phosphate induction of cadherins and the formation of well developed adherens junctions in HEK293 fibroblast cells (30Lee M. Van Brocklyn J.R. Thangada S. Liu C.H. Hand A.R. Menzeleev R. Spiegel S. Hla T. Science. 1998; 279: 1552-1555Crossref PubMed Scopus (875) Google Scholar). Studies in Drosophila have attributed a role for Rac1 in organizing perijunctional actin at the adherens junction of the wing disc epithelium (31Eaton S. Auvinen P. Luo L. Jan Y.N. Simons K. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 151-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Moreover, Rac-dependent signaling at cell junctions appears to be cell-type specific, because activated Rac, or its exchange factor, Tiam1, induce invasion of T lymphoma cells but suppress invasion in epithelial cells by increasing its adhesive properties (32Hordijk P.L. ten Klooster J.P. Van der Kammen R.A. Michiels F. Oomen L.C. Collard J.G. Science. 1997; 278: 1464-1466Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar). Rab proteins, such as rab13 (33Zahraoui A. Joberty G. Arpin M. Fontaine J.J. Hellio R. Tavitian A. Louvard D. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 101-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar) and rab3B (34Weber E. Berta G. Tousson A. St. John P. Green M.W.

Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 583-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar), have been found to be concentrated at the tight junctions, although they are generally thought to function in the control of vesicle targeting to the plasma membrane. Aberrant activation of oncogenic Ras proteins in epithelial cells is characterized by mesenchymal/fibroblastic morphology with a perturbation of the adherens junction (35Schoenenberger C.A. Zuk A. Kendall D. Matlin K.S. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 112: 8738-8789Crossref Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 36Kinch M.S. Clark G.J. Der C.J. Burridge K. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 461-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). However, little is known about the role of cellular Ras in the regulation of epithelial junctional complex or whether the physiological stimuli that control cell-cell interactions can exert their effects through Ras signaling pathways. To further elucidate the mechanisms of signal transmission required for the regulation of the tight junction, we have been utilizing the Con8 mammary tumor epithelial cell line to investigate the hormonal control of cell-cell interactions (22Buse P.

Con8 cells grow as poorly differentiated monolayers, exhibiting deficient cell adhesion and poor tight junction organization (37Wong V. Ching D. McCrea P.D. Firestone G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5443-5453Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Our previous studies have shown that treatment with the synthetic glucocorticoid dexamethasone induces the assembly and function of the tight junction, concurrent with an induction of a G1 cell cycle arrest (22Buse P. Woo P.L. Alexander D.B. Cha H.H. Reza A. Sirota N.D. Firestone G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6505-6514Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 38Goya L. Maiyar A.C. Ge Y. Firestone G.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1993; 7: 1121-1132Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Dexamethasone stimulates an increase in the transepithelial electrical resistance (TER) of the epithelial monolayer, which directly correlated with a decrease in paracellular permeability to radioactive tracers across the epithelium (22Buse P. Woo P.L. Alexander D.B. Cha H.H. Reza A. Sirota N.D. Firestone G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6505-6514Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), thus verifying the steroid induction of tight junction barrier properties. In addition, glucocorticoids induce the reorganization of the apical junction leading to the recruitment of tight junction and adherens junction proteins to their respective location (22Buse P.

Given the intimate association of certain growth factor signaling components with structural proteins at the cell junction, we investigated the potential roles of cellular Ras and PI 3-kinase in the cell signaling pathways by which glucocorticoids regulate mammary tumor cell-cell interactions. Our results demonstrate that Ras and PI 3-kinase are recruited to regions of cell-cell contact as a consequence of the glucocorticoid-induced membrane reorganization event. Moreover, inhibition of Ras and PI 3-kinase pathways abolishes or attenuates the glucocorticoid-mediated enhancement of the tight junction seal without altering the remodeling of the cell junction, which suggests that these two events can be uncoupled by their requirements for growth factor signaling pathways.

Con8 rat mammary epithelial cells were routinely grown to 100% confluency on Nunc permeable supports in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/Ham's F-12 supplemented with 10% calf serum and penicillin/streptomycin and maintained at 37 °C in a humid atmosphere of air/CO2 (95:5). Cell culture medium was routinely changed every 24 h. To generate the control C7 and dominant-negative RasN17 cell lines, the plasmid pMMrasDN was transfected into Con8 cells, together with a plasmid encoding neomycin resistance (pRSV-neo). After selection with the neomycin analogue G418 for 2 weeks, 50 clones were selected, expanded, and tested for their induction of RasN17 by dexamethasone. The formation of tight junctions was monitored by measuring TER using an EVOM Epithelial Voltohmmeter (World Precision Instruments, Sarasota, FL) as described previously (22Buse P. Woo P.L.

Calculations for ohms cm2 were determined by subtracting the resistance measurement of a blank filter and multiplying by the area of the monolayer (0.49 cm2 for the 10-mm filters). To quantitate relative rates of DNA synthesis, triplicate samples of Con8 cells were grown on 24-well plates and treated with the indicated combinations of dexamethasone, LY294002, and/or wortmannin. The media were replaced with fresh media containing 6 μCi/ml [3H]thymidine (90 Ci/mmol) and the cells were incubated for 2 h.

Con8 mammary cells were grown on Nunc filters and incubated with the indicated combinations of dexamethasone, PD 098059, LY294002, and/or wortmannin. The cell monolayers were washed three times with Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 130 mg/liter CaCl2·2H2O and 100 mg/liter MgCl2·6H2O and fixed with 1.75% formaldehyde in PBS for 15 min at room temperature. After three additional washes with PBS, the plasma membrane was permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS for 10 min. Following three washes, nonspecific areas were blocked with TBST (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20) with 3% nonfat dry milk. All subsequent incubations with antibodies and washes were performed with this buffer. Cells were incubated with primary antibodies against ZO-1 (1:350 dilution), β-catenin (1:500), Ras (Y13–258, 1:300), and p85 (1:200) at room temperature for 2 h and then washed three times. For the secondary reaction, goat fluorescein- or Texas Red-conjugated antibodies were incubated for 1 h at a 1:100 dilution and stained cells were mounted with SlowFade™Light Antifade reagent (Molecular Probes, Inc.). 100 μm4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole was added to the secondary reaction to visualize nuclear morphology. Stained and mounted cells were then processed with a Zeiss Axioplan epifluorescence microscope using a Zeiss × 40 Plan-Neofluar multi-immersion objective (0.9 NA) or analyzed with a Bio-Rad MRC 600 confocal system. A series ofx-y optical sections was collected for each specimen in 0.5-μm increments. A Kalman average of 8 frames/image was obtained for each section using a zoom setting of 1.5. Ax-z view was acquired by averaging sections over a line at each z position in 0.2 μm steps. Protein samples were fractionated on a 7.8% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Proteins were electrophoretically transferred from the gel to nitrocellulose membrane (Micron Separations Inc., Westboro). Blots were blocked in TBST (5% nonfat dry milk) for 2 h at room temperature and incubated in Y13-259 anti-Ras or p85 antibodies (1:1000) overnight at 4 °C. After three washes, 15 min each, in TBST (1% non-fat dry milk), the blots were incubated with anti-rat antibodies conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Bio-Rad) for 1 h at room temperature and washed as above. The blots were developed by NEN Life Science Products chemiluminescence reagent kit. Confluent monolayers of C7 and DN5 cells on 6-well plates (35 mm-diameter wells) and treated with 1 μm dexamethasone for 6 h and washed twice with PBS containing 130 mg/liter CaCl2·2H2O and 100 mg/liter MgCl2·6H2O at 37 °C. Freshly prepared 0.8 ml of 1.25 × permeabilization buffer (PB: 6.25 mm MgCl2, 12.5 mm PIPES, pH 7.4, with KOH), 150 mm KCl, 37.5 mm NaCl, 1 mm EGTA, 0.8 mm CaCl2, 1.25 mm ATP), 200 μl of streptolysin-O (2 units/ml), and 1 μl of [α-32P]GTP was added to each well for 20 min. Cells were lysed with 1 ml of lysis buffer (25 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, 1% Triton X-100, 137 mm NaCl, 5 mmMgCl2, 5 mm KCl, 0.7 mmCaCl2, 10 mm benzamidine, leupeptin (1 μg/ml), aprotinin (2 μg/ml), 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 100 μm GTP, 100 μm GDP, 1 mm ATP, 1 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.4)) and total Ras protein was immunoprecipitated with monoclonal Y13-259 antibody prebound to protein G-Sepharose for 1 h at 4 °C. Immunoprecipitates were washed five times with 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 500 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.005% SDS and GTP-bound Ras was eluted in 2 mm EDTA, 2 mm 1,4-dithiothreitol, 0.2% SDS, 0.5 mm GTP, 0.5 m GDP at 68 °C for 20 min. The radioactivity released, representing the total initial GTP bound to Ras (GTP + GTP hydrolyzed to GDP prior to immunoprecipitation) was quantitated by scintillation counting. Cells were grown to confluence in 100-mm tissue culture dishes and treated with combinations of 1 μm dexamethasone, 50 μmPD 098059, and/or 50 μm LY294002 for 24 h. Cells were then scraped into the media in which they had been incubated (floating cells were combined with the attached cells) and samples were normalized for protein content. Low molecular weight genomic DNA was extracted with 0.5% Triton X-100, 10 mm EDTA, and 10 mm Tris, pH 7.4. After three phenol-chloroform extractions and ethanol precipitation, low molecular weight DNA was analyzed on a 1.5% agarose gel in TAE buffer. In Con8 mammary tumor cells, the glucocorticoid stimulation of tight junction formation involves a morphological remodeling of the apical junction, as well as an enhancement of the electrical tightness of the junctional barrier (22Buse P.

In addition, we have observed that serum stimulates both the basal and glucocorticoid-regulated TER, suggesting that a serum/growth factor signaling pathway can facilitate the establishment of a tight paracellular seal. 2P. L. Woo and G. L. Firestone, unpublished data. Given that the tight junction consists of several multifunctional adapter proteins implicated in organizing signaling components into macromolecular assemblies, it is conceivable that the glucocorticoid-induced organization of the cell junction includes the recruitment of cell signaling molecules to the junctional complex. Two such signaling molecules, whose activation and function depend on their associations with the plasma membrane, are the small GTPase Ras and PI 3-kinase, which is comprised of a p85 regulatory and a p110 catalytic subunit (39Khosravi F.R. Campbell S. Rossman K.L. Der C.J. Adv. Cancer Res. 1998; 72: 57-107Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 40Wymann M.P. Pirola L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1436: 127-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (572) Google Scholar). To determine whether the distribution of Ras or PI 3-kinase is altered during the stimulation of tight junction formation, Con8 cells were grown on filter inserts and treated with the synthetic glucocorticoid dexamethasone over a 4-day time course. During this time course, dexamethasone stimulated the monolayer TER, reflecting the formation of functional tight junctions (Fig.1 A). At the end of the time course, the glucocorticoid-treated and untreated cell monolayers were fixed, permeabilized, and immunostained for Ras localization using the Y13-238 monoclonal antibody and for PI 3-kinase localization using the polyclonal antibody to the p85 subunit of PI 3-kinase (Fig.1 B). Similar to the reorganization of tight junction and adherens junction structural proteins (22Buse P. Woo P.L. Alexander D.B. Cha H.H. Reza A. Sirota N.D. Firestone G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6505-6514Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 37Wong V. Ching D. McCrea P.D. Firestone G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5443-5453Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), dexamethasone induced the translocation of both Ras and PI 3-kinase to the cell periphery, concurrent with an increase in tight junction integrity as indicated by the stimulation of TER. In contrast, in the absence of dexamethasone, Ras and PI 3-kinase exhibited a predominately diffuse staining pattern under conditions in which the monolayer TER remained at basal levels. The elevated level of junctional p85 staining was not due to an increase in the abundance of p85 since the protein levels did not change in response to dexamethasone (Fig. 1 C). Similarly, dexamethasone has no effect on the level of endogenous Ras protein (see next section). These results demonstrate that glucocorticoid treatment recruits both Ras and PI 3-kinase to the cell periphery, suggesting that these cell signaling molecules potentially function as regulators of tight junction dynamics. To directly test whether cellular Ras plays a role in the glucocorticoid regulation of tight junction formation, Con8 cells were stably co-transfected with an expression vector encoding the dominant-negative Asn-17 mutant of Ha-ras (RasN17) under the control of the dexamethasone-inducible mouse mammary tumor virus-long terminal repeat promoter along with a plasmid encoding the neomycin resistance gene to select for transfection competent cells. Stable transfectants were selected by their resistance to the cytotoxic effects of G418, and the resulting cell clones were screened for dexamethasone induction of RasN17 protein expression. One such transfected cell clone, DN5, as well as a control clone, C7, were utilized for our studies. Western blot analysis of dexamethasone-treated and untreated cells revealed that DN5 cells rapidly produce high levels of RasN17 by 4 h of glucocorticoid treatment (Fig. 2 A). The level of RasN17 continued to increase throughout the 72-h time course in dexamethasone. The C7 cells did not produce detectable levels of RasN17, even after 72 h in dexamethasone, and represents a RasN17-transfected control cell line for many of the subsequent experiments. In addition, the level of endogenous Ras did not significantly change with dexamethasone treatment during this time course. To confirm that the RasN17 inhibits endogenous Ras function by competing for its GTP exchange factors (41Feig L.A. Cooper G.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 3235-3243Crossref PubMed Scopus (672) Google Scholar), a GTP binding assay was employed to assess the total level of GTP-bound Ras. DN5 cells and the control C7 cells were treated wi"

Initially the sulfur of methionine displaces the intact tripolyphosphate chain (PPPi) from ATP, and subsequently PPPi is hydrolyzed to PPi and Pibefore product release. The crystal structure of Escherichia coli AdoMet synthetase shows that the active site contains four aspartate residues. Aspartate residues Asp-16* and Asp-271 individually provide the sole protein ligand to one of the two required Mg2+ ions (* denotes a residue from a second subunit); aspartates Asp-118 and Asp-238* are proposed to interact with methionine. Each aspartate has been changed to an uncharged asparagine, and the metal binding residues were also changed to alanine, to assess the roles of charge and ligation ability on catalytic efficiency. The resultant enzyme variants all structurally resemble the wild type enzyme as indicated by circular dichroism spectra and are tetramers. However, all have k cat reductions of ∼103-fold in AdoMet synthesis, whereas the MgATP and methionine K m values change by less than 3- and 8-fold, respectively. In the partial reaction of PPPihydrolysis, mutants of the Mg2+ binding residues have >700-fold reduced catalytic efficiency (k cat/K m ), whereas the D118N and D238*N mutants are impaired less than 35-fold. The catalytic efficiency for PPPi hydrolysis by Mg2+ site mutants is improved by AdoMet, like the wild type enzyme. In contrast AdoMet reduces the catalytic efficiency for PPPi hydrolysis by the D118N and D238*N mutants, indicating that the events involved in AdoMet activation are hindered in these methionyl binding site mutants. Ca2+ uniquely activates the D271A mutant enzyme to 15% of the level of Mg2+, in contrast to the ∼1% Ca2+ activation of the wild type enzyme. This indicates that the Asp-271 side chain size is a discriminator between the activating ability of Ca2+ and the smaller Mg2+.

AdoMet plays a myriad of biological roles including acting as the primary methyl group donor in all organisms and as a precursor to the polyamines (1Mudd S.H. Boyer P.D. 3rd Ed. The Enzymes. 8.

Recent NMR results have provided a proposed binding site of the product AdoMet (16Schalk-Hihi C. Markham G.D. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 4433-4440Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). All of the polar active site residues are conserved in the more than 30 reported AdoMet synthetase sequences. A number of naturally occurring human variants have been recently discovered in patients with familial hypermethioninemia (17Chamberlin M.E. Ubagai T. Mudd S.H. Levy H.L. Chou J.Y. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1997; 60: 540-546PubMed Google Scholar, 18Chamberlin M.E. Ubagai T. Mudd S.H. Wilson W.G. Leonard J.V. Chou J.Y. J. Clin.

Genet. 1997; 75: 395-400Crossref Scopus (36) Google Scholar); only one of the variations is at an active site residue, an arginine whose crucial role in the E. colienzyme has been recently characterized (12Reczkowski R.S. Taylor J.C. Markham G.D. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 13499-13506Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The active site of the enzyme resides between two subunits, such that residues from both subunits make contributions (Fig. 1). The phosphate groups bind at the bottom of a deep cavity with the adenosyl group nearer the entrance. Each active site binds two divalent metal ions (e.g., Mg2+) and a monovalent cation (K+), all of which are required for maximal AdoMet synthetic activity (5Markham G.D. Hafner E.W. Tabor C.W. Tabor H. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 9082-9092Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Markham G.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 1903-1909Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7Markham G.D.

Thus, AdoMet synthetase belongs to a diverse group of enzymes that use two or more metal ions to facilitate phosphoryl group transfers (21Sträter N. Lipscomb W.N. Klabunde T. Krebs B. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 1996; 35: 2024-2055Crossref Scopus (595) Google Scholar). Within the active site are four aspartate residues, two from each subunit (a residue from the second subunit is denoted by *, e.g. Asp-16*, Asp-118, Asp-238*, and Asp-271). Crystallographic data show that the Asp-16* and Asp-271 side chains each provide the sole protein ligands to one of the two Mg2+ ions; both Mg2+ ions are also ligated to three phosphoryl groups (Fig. 1) (13Takusagawa F. Kamitori S. Misaki S. Markham G.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 136-147Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 14Fu Z. Hu Y. Markham G.D. Takusagawa F. J. Biomol. Struct.

Both Asp-16* and Asp-271 provide bidentate ligands to a Mg2+; bidentate coordination of Mg2+ to a carboxylate helps to provide precise positioning of the cation (22Carrell C.J. Carrrell H.L. Erlebacher J. Glusker J.P. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1988; 100: 8651-8656Crossref Scopus (217) Google Scholar). In the absence of substrates, AdoMet synthetase binds a single divalent cation per active site, while two bind in the presence of phosphate containing ligands (6Markham G.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 1903-1909Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). None of the available crystallographic or spectroscopic data have resolved which site is occupied in the absence of phosphoryl group containing ligands (6Markham G.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 1903-1909Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7Markham G.D. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 470-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 8Zhang C. Markham G.D. LoBrutto R. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 9866-9873Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The side chains of aspartates 118 and 238* are implicated in the NMR model as binding the methionine group; Asp-118 interacts with the sulfur and Asp-238* with the α-amino group (16Schalk-Hihi C. Markham G.D. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 4433-4440Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). In addition to the overall reaction, AdoMet synthetase catalyzes the Mg2+-dependent hydrolysis of PPPi to PPi and Pi, a reaction that mimics the second part of the synthetase reaction (5Markham G.D. Hafner E.W. Tabor C.W. Tabor H. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 9082-9092Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,23Mudd S.H. J. Biol.

Chem. 1977; 252: 4506-4513Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The rate of PPPi hydrolysis is greatly stimulated by AdoMet; the physical mechanism of this activation is as yet unknown but is probably due to local conformational adjustments. The features of AdoMet or the enzyme that contribute to this activation are unclear, although the sulfonium group is important since neither the adenosylhomocysteine nor methylthioadenosine fragments activate the rate of PPPi hydrolysis (5Markham G.D. Hafner E.W. Tabor C.W. Tabor H. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 9082-9092Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the present studies, the active site aspartate residues have been changed to asparagine to remove their electrostatic contributions to binding and catalysis while maintaining steric and (altered) hydrogen bonding capabilities. In addition, the metal binding aspartates have been changed to alanine to evaluate the role of steric effects in discrimination among cations of different sizes. The properties of these mutants provide insight into the important side chain properties for metal ion binding and into the basis of AdoMet activation of PPPi hydrolysis. l-Methionine, ATP, KCl, MgCl2, (NH4)6Mo7O24·4H2O, NaAsO2, citric acid, ascorbic acid, acetic acid, malachite green, Tris, Hepes, 2-mercaptoethanol, and sodium tripolyphosphate were purchased from Sigma.

E. coli strains XL1-Blue (anE. coli K12 derivative) or RSR15(DE3) (an E. coliB derivative) were used. RSR15(DE3) is a metK derivative of BL21(DE3); extracts of this strain have no detectable AdoMet synthetase activity (11Reczkowski R.S. Markham G.D. J. Biol.

Oligonucleotides used in mutagenesis were prepared in the Core Facility at the Fox Chase Cancer Center. Mutants were constructed using the Quikchange kit (Stratagene) on plasmid pT7K (11Reczkowski R.S. Markham G.D. J. Biol.

Following transformation and selection for ampicillin resistance, plasmid DNA was extracted using the Wizard Plus Minipreps DNA Purification System (Promega Corp., Madison, WI). Mutants were identified directly by DNA sequencing on an ABI automated sequencer. In all cases complete DNA sequences confirmed that only the desired mutations were introduced. Plasmids were transformed into strain RSR15(DE3). Cultures were grown in LB media containing 50 μg/ml carbenecillin. Following overnight growth, 0.1 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was added to the cultures for 30 min prior to harvesting. Mutant proteins accounted for ∼10–20% of the total cellular protein. A standard purification protocol was used to isolate both wild type and mutant AdoMet synthetases (11Reczkowski R.S. Markham G.D. J. Biol.

Purifications were monitored by electrophoresis on 10–15% gradient gels containing SDS. All AdoMet synthetases were electrophoretically homogeneous. Following purification, AdoMet synthetases were analyzed for oligomerization state by native gel electrophoresis on 8–25% gradient gels (11Reczkowski R.S. Markham G.D. J. Biol.

Secondary structure was assessed by circular dichroism spectra recorded on an Aviv model 62A spectropolarimeter. Samples (0.3 mg/ml protein in 25 mm Tris/HCl, 25 mm KCl, pH 8.0) were placed in 1-mm path length cells, spectra were recorded from 200 to 260 nm, and spectra were corrected for buffer contributions. AdoMet synthetase activity was determined by the [14C]AdoMet filter binding method (11Reczkowski R.S. Markham G.D. J. Biol.

The tripolyphosphatase activity was determined in the presence or absence of AdoMet by quantifying orthophosphate production (26Chifflet S. Torriglia A. Chiesa R. Tolosa S. Anal.

Assays contained 3–500 μmPPPi (Na+ salt) in 50 mmHepes·(CH3)4N+ at pH 7.8 with 10 mm KCl and 10 mm MgCl2. In AdoMet synthetase activity assays using CaCl2 in place of MgCl2, CaCl2 was present at 40 mm. It was not possible to perform tripolyphosphatase activity assays in the presence of Ca2+ due to the low solubility of the Ca2+ complexes. In substrate tests for 2-hydroxy-4-methylthiobutyric acid and 2-keto-4-methylthiobutyric acid, potential products were separated from substrates by chromatography on a Mono-S cation exchange column developed in 0.6 n HCl since the products would be uncharged at neutral pH and would not be retained in the filter binding assay. Reactions contained 10 mm ATP and 10 mmmethionine or analog. Product formation was assessed from absorbance at 254 nm; the analogs yielded <1% of the amount of product obtained with methionine. Substrate saturation data were evaluated using the kinetic equations of Cleland (28Cleland W.W. Methods Enzymol. 1979; 63: 103-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (1930) Google Scholar) as implemented in the program Scientist (MicroMath, Inc.), or the Enzfitter program (Elsevier Biosoft). The six mutants constructed in this study are physically indistinguishable from the wild type enzyme. All the proteins behaved identically to the wild type enzyme through a purification procedure that exploits a variety of physical properties (in contrast, previously studied mutants at Cys-89 yielded rather differently behaving active dimeric enzymes; Ref. 11Reczkowski R.S.

These six mutant AdoMet synthetases are similar to the wild type enzyme in secondary structure as judged by indistinguishable circular dichroism spectra, and are tetrameric according to native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis.

AdoMet synthetase PPPi + H2O → PPi + Pi ± AdoMet In the presence of Mg2+as activator, the kcat for AdoMet synthesis by each of the six mutants is reduced by ∼3 orders of magnitude with respect to the wild type enzyme (Table I). In contrast, there are only 3- and 8-fold alterations in the K m values for MgATP and methionine, respectively. The kinetic properties of the D16A mutant show a 2-fold improved k catand different K m values from the D16N mutant, being 4-fold diminished for ATP and 3-fold increased for methionine. In contrast, the kinetic parameters for the D271A and D271N mutants are not significantly different. In all six cases, the production of AdoMet is linear with time from within 10% of a single turnover, demonstrating that an early step in the mechanism, likely AdoMet formation, remains rate-limiting. There is no obvious pattern ink cat, K m, ork cat/K m alterations with respect to the proposed role of the residues or the subunit from which the residues originate. It should be noted that K m values, at least for the wild type enzyme, are complex kinetic constants and may not closely reflect true binding constants (29Markham G.D. Parkin D.W. Mentch F. Schramm V.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 5609-5615Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Since residues Asp-16* and Asp-271 are implicated in Mg2+binding, the concentration dependence of Mg2+ activation of the AdoMet synthetase reaction was assessed. The Mg2+concentration dependences for the D16*N and D271N mutants showed 15- and 10-fold increases in the activator constant (K a ) for Mg2+, while 11-fold increases are found for both Asp → Ala mutants. The Mg2+ activator constants are also increased 8- and 10-fold for the D118N and D238*N mutants, respectively. AdoMet synthetase also catalyzes the hydrolysis of added tripolyphosphate, and the reaction rate is stimulated by AdoMet. The kinetic parameters for PPPihydrolysis by the variants under consideration are summarized in TableII. In the absence of AdoMet, there is a dramatic effect on k cat/K m of mutations at the metal ligand positions Asp-16* and Asp-271. We could not detect PPPi hydrolysis by the D16*N or D16*A mutants, <0.1% of the wild type activity. For the D271N mutant, theK m for PPPi increased ∼1000-fold so that it was not possible to saturate the enzyme; however, the extrapolated k cat for the D271N mutant is close to the wild type value and to the value for the D271A mutant, which has a 120-fold elevated K m value. For the D118N and D238*N mutants, the K m values for PPPidid not greatly change from the wild type level, whilek cat values decreased 11-fold and actuallyincreased 5-fold, respectively. In common with the wild type enzyme, AdoMet dramatically enhancesk cat/K m for the D16*N, D16*A, D271A, and D271N enzymes, although the AdoMet concentrations required are larger than the wild type levels. For the D271N and D271A mutants AdoMet causes ∼200-fold and 20-fold reductions in theK m of PPPi to approximately the wild type value; the k cat value appears to decrease 1.5–2-fold, although since the value in the absence of AdoMet is an extrapolation this may not be significant. In the presence of AdoMet, the PPPi K m for the D16*N mutant is ∼6-fold larger than the wild type value while theK m for the D16*A mutant is 77-fold larger. Thek cat values at saturating AdoMet for each of the Asp-16* and Asp-271 mutants are substantially larger than the rate of the overall reaction, consistent with an early rate-limiting step in the overall reaction. The AdoMet effects on PPPi hydrolysis for methionine binding site mutants are quite different. AdoMet has no effect onk cat for D238*N, although theK m for PPPi does increase 14-fold yielding a less efficient enzyme. Measurements at subsaturating levels of PPPi allowed determination of a half-maximal effect value (K a ) for AdoMet of 0.4 μm, 4-fold lower than the wild type enzyme; this parallels the 5-fold reduced K m for methionine in the overall reaction. For the D118N mutant, the K a for AdoMet increased ∼28-fold, as the K m for methionine increased 4.8-fold. With the D118N mutant the presence of AdoMet resulted in theK m for PPPi approximately doubling, while the k cat actually decreased4-fold. As a complementary approach to mutagenesis, we evaluated interactions of the wild type enzyme with two methionine analogs that lack the α-amino group, i.e. 2-hydroxy-4-methylthiobutyric acid and 2-keto-4-methylthiobutyric acid. Neither was a substrate, and concentrations up to 10 mm did not inhibit the rate of AdoMet formation at 0.1 mm methionine, illustrating the importance of the amino group in the affinity for the substrate. Since previous studies suggested that one of the two metal sites was more tolerant of replacement of Mg2+ by the larger Ca2+ ion (7Markham G.D. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 470-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), we tested Ca2+ activation of the isosteric Asp → Asn mutants and the side chain size reduced Asp → Ala mutants. Of all the mutants, activity could only be detected for the D271A enzyme (Table III). For the D271A enzyme, the k cat is only 7-fold reduced from Mg2+, in contrast to the wild type enzyme, wherek cat is reduced 78-fold in the presence of Ca2+. The K a for Ca2+ is 20 mm for the D271A mutant, and 15 mm for the wild type enzyme. The K m values for ATP are similar and are 8- and 5-fold larger than with Mg2+ for the mutan"

By using a GST-CD120a-(207–425) fusion protein as substrate, phosphorylation was induced following stimulation of mouse macrophages with TNFα, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor, macrophage colony-stimulating factor, and zymosan particles and was blocked by immunodepletion of p42 mapk/erk2 and by specific inhibition of p42 mapk/erk2 activation with PD098059.

Although RIP has been implicated in the initiation of NF-κB activation, these findings do not, as yet, invoke other receptor-associated protein Ser/Thr or Tyr kinases in the functions of CD120a (p55). However, several reports have shown protein Ser/Thr kinase activities to be bound by sequences located within the intracellular domain of both TNF receptors (12Darnay B.G. Reddy S.A. Aggarwal B.B. J.

In the case of CD120b (p75), the receptor-associated kinase has been identified as casein kinase I, and its activity has been shown to prevent apoptotic cell death (15Beyaert R. Vanhaesebroeck B.

A serine-kinase activity that co-immunoprecipitates with CD120a (p55) in human U937 cells has also been shown to phosphorylate receptor-associated substrates of molecular masses 125, 97, 85, and 60 kDa in a ligand-dependent fashion (16VanArsdale T.L.

The only CD120a (p55)-associated Ser/Thr-kinase to be cloned is RIP, a death domain-containing receptor-interacting protein (6Hsu H. Huang J. Shu H.-B. Baichwal V. Goeddel D.V.

However, although its kinase activity has been implicated in downstream signaling leading to the activation of I-κB kinases (18Liu Z.-G. Hsu H. Goeddel D.V. Karin M. Cell. 1996; 87: 565-576Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1784) Google Scholar), it has not been shown to stimulate phosphorylation of CD120a (p55) itself. Although these reports have provided intriguing and important insights into CD120a (p55)-associated kinases and their mode of interaction with the cytoplasmic domain of CD120a (p55), the identity and function(s) of CD120a (p55)-Ser/Thr kinase activities remain largely unknown. The MAPKs currently comprise three major subfamilies in mammalian cells as follows: 1) the p38 mapk subfamily (19Han J. Lee J.D. Bibbs L. Ulevitch R.J.

All family members are proline-directed Ser/Thr kinases, and while p38 mapk and JNK sub-family members appear to phosphorylate the basic kinase consensus motif, (S/T)P (24Mukhopadhyay N.K. Price D.J.

In work previously reported from this laboratory, we have shown that specific members of each MAPK subfamily are rapidly and transiently activated in response to stimulation of mouse macrophages with TNFα (27Winston B.W.

However, although the targets of these kinases include transcription factors involved in the inflammatory response, we have questioned if they also include CD120a (p55) itself. The 218 amino acids of the cytoplasmic domain of mouse CD120a (p55) are organized into the death domain (residues 326–411) (30Tartaglia L.A. Merrill Ayres T. Wong G.H.W. Goeddel D.V. Cell. 1993; 74: 845-853Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1169) Google Scholar) and a Ser-, Thr-, and Pro-rich membrane proximal region broadly located between residues 230 and 280. Within this region are seven basic Pro-directed kinase motifs and four sequences bearing the consensus ERK phosphorylation motif. Based on these collective observations we have investigated (i) if MAPKs interact with and phosphorylate the cytoplasmic domain of CD120a (p55) and (ii) the consequence of this event on CD120a (p55) subcellular localization. C3H/HeJ mice were used throughout the study and were bred in the Biological Resource Center at National Jewish Center. Phospho-specific anti-p42 mapk/erk2 antibody (Ab V6671) was purchased from Promega (Madison, WI). Rabbit polyclonal anti- p42 mapk/erk2 (Ab 93 and 154), anti-p46 jnk1 (Ab 154), anti-p38 mapk (Ab 535), phosphospecific anti-p46 jnk1 (Ab 6254), and goat polyclonal anti-CD120a (p55) (Ab 1069) antibodies, and activating transcription factor-2 (ATF-2) were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). The anti-p38 mapk antibody used for immunoprecipitation was a kind gift from Dr Gary L. Johnson (National Jewish Medical and Research Center, Denver, CO). The hamster monoclonal anti-CD120a (p55) antagonist antibody (Ab 80-4005-01) used for immunoprecipitation and confocal microscopy was purchased from Genzyme (Cambridge, MA). The phosphospecific anti-p38 mapk antibody and the mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK) inhibitor (PD098059) were purchased from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA). The anti-MEK-1 antibody was from Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY). The p38 mapk inhibitor (SB203580) and the recombinant-activated p42 mapk/erk2 (Ab 454855) were purchased from Calbiochem. Rabbit polyclonal anti-p42 mapk/erk2 antibodies (Ab 06-182) were purchased from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. (Lake Placid, NY). Anti-vesicular stomatitis virus G-protein (VSV-G) and anti-adapter protein-1 (AP-1) antibodies were from Sigma. Fluorescent secondary antibodies were purchased from Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories (West Grove, PA). Monolayers of mouse bone marrow-derived macrophages were prepared from femoral and tibial bone marrow as described previously (27Winston B.W. Riches D.W.H. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 1525-1533PubMed Google Scholar). To label the endogenous CD120a (p55), bone marrow-derived macrophages (∼2 × 106 cells) were washed with phosphate-free medium and incubated with 1 mCi of [32P]orthophosphate in phosphate-free Eagle's minimal essential medium for 6 h. Cells were stimulated with 1 μm okadaic acid during the last 3 h of the incubation period, and lysed in 1 ml of Nonidet P-40 buffer. Lysates were treated with 5 units of DNase for 15 min at 4 °C, before being pre-cleared with 15 μl of protein A/G-Plus Sepharose beads. CD120a (p55) was then immunoprecipitated overnight at 4 °C with 2.5 μg of anti-CD120a (p55) antagonist hamster monoclonal antibody or 2.5 μg of H57 anti-T-cell receptor hamster monoclonal antibody as a control, and 25 μl of protein A/G-Plus-Sepharose beads. The beads were washed 12 times with Nonidet P-40 buffer. Duplicates of each condition were pooled and resolved by SDS-PAGE, transferred onto nitrocellulose, and subjected to autoradiography. The GST-CD120a-(207–425) fusion protein was created by fusing the COOH terminus of glutathione S-transferase (GST) to the full-length intracellular domain (amino acids 207–425) of mouse CD120a (p55). A 654-base pair EcoRI/SalI cDNA fragment encoding these residues was amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), digested with EcoRI and SalI, and ligated into EcoRI/SalI-digested pGEX-5X-1. The cDNA encoding amino acids 1–425 (i.e. the entire receptor except for the signal peptide) was amplified by PCR, digested with EcoRI, and subcloned into EcoRI-digested pFLAG-CMV-1 downstream of the signal sequence and the sequence encoding the FLAG epitope (GYKDDDDK). CD120a (p55) T236A, S240A, S244A, S270A and CD120a (p55) T236D, S240E, S244E, S270E mutants were constructed using overlapping PCR and also ligated into pFLAG-CMV-1. The fidelity of all the constructs was verified by restriction enzyme analysis and nucleotide sequencing. The expression vectors for HA-taggedXenopus p42 mapk/erk2 (HA.ERK2.WT) and a constitutively active mutated form of Xenopus MEK-1 (MEK1.CA) in the pcDNA3 vector (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) were a generous gift from Dr. Lynn Heasley, Department of Renal Medicine, University of Colorado Health Sciences Center, Denver, CO. The vector expressing VSV-G bearing a COOH-terminal KKTN motif was kindly provided by Dr. Alexander van der Bliek, Los Angeles, CA. The expression and purification of GST and the GST-CD120a-(207–425) fusion protein were carried out as described (31Frangioni J.V. Neel B.G. Anal. Biochem. 1993; 210: 179-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (833) Google Scholar). The amount of fusion protein was estimated by SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions using varying amounts of bovine serum albumin as a standard, followed by staining with Coomassie Blue. Unstimulated or TNFα-stimulated macrophage monolayers (∼5 × 107 cells) were scraped into 2 ml of ice-cold lysis buffer (50 mm Tris buffer, pH 8.0, containing 1% Nonidet P-40, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mmNaF, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1 mmNa3VO4). Nuclear material was pelleted by centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was loaded onto an anion-exchange column (Mono-Q, BioLogic Systems, Inc.) equilibrated in 50 mmβ-glycerophosphate, pH 7.2, containing 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mmNa3VO4, and 0.05 m NaCl. The elution profile consisted of a flow rate of 1 ml/min for 40 ml with a linear gradient of 0.05 to 0.2 m NaCl in equilibration buffer, followed by a flow rate of 1 ml/min for 4 ml with a linear gradient of 0.2 to 1 m NaCl, then by an isocratic flow of 1m NaCl at a rate of 1 ml/min for 20 ml. Two ml fractions were collected, and 1-ml aliquots were tested for in vitrokinase activity using GST-CD120a-(207–425) beads as substrate as described below. Macrophage monolayers (∼2 × 106 cells) were rinsed with ice-cold 20 mmHepes-buffered saline, pH 7.4, and lysed on ice in 500 μl of Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (50 mm Tris buffer, pH 8.0, containing 1% Nonidet P-40, 137 mm NaCl, and protease inhibitors as described above). Nuclear material was pelleted by centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. Supernatants were transferred to a new tube and precleared with 20 μl of washed GST-coated beads for 20 min at 4 °C on a rotator. The beads were spun down at 3000 rpm for 3 min, the supernatants were transferred to new tubes, and incubated with 20 μl of washed GST-CD120a-(207–425)-coated beads for 150 min at 4 °C on a rotator. After incubation, the beads were spun down at 3000 rpm for 3 min, washed twice with Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer, and then twice with PAN buffer (10 mm Pipes buffer, pH 7.0, containing 100 mm NaCl and 10 μg/ml aprotinin). After the last wash, the beads were resuspended in 40 μl of PAN buffer to bring the mixture up to 60 μl and then used in the in vitro kinase assay as described below. In experiments in which the binding of cytosolic proteins to GST-CD120-(207–425) was determined by Western blotting, ∼5 × 107 cells were lysed and prepared as described above before being directly subjected to SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Kinase assays were performed at 30 °C for 30 min in kinase buffer (10 mm Pipes buffer, pH 7.2, containing 10 mm MnCl2 and 20 μg/ml aprotinin) together with 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP. The kinase reactions were terminated by the addition of 20 μl of 5× Laemmli sample buffer containing 100 mm dithiothreitol. The mixtures were boiled for 5 min, separated by SDS-PAGE, and transferred to nitrocellulose for autoradiography and Western analysis. In in vitro kinase assays with recombinant p42 mapk/erk2, 50 ng of recombinant MEK-1-activated p42 mapk/erk2 (i.e. constitutively active) were incubated for 150 min at 4 °C with 20 μl of washed GST-CD120a-(207–425) beads resuspended in 40 μl of PAN buffer. The kinase reactions were conducted directly or after the beads were washed 4 times with Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer and 4 times with PAN buffer as described above. Mouse macrophages were lysed as described above, and post-nuclear supernatants were precleared with 15 μl of protein A-Sepharose beads. Individual MAPKs were immunoprecipitated by incubation at 4 °C for 2 h with 5 μg of p38 mapk, p42 mapk/erk2, and p46 jnk1 antibodies and 25 μl of protein A-Sepharose beads. The beads were then washed twice with Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer and twice with PAN buffer. Kinase activity was assayed as described above with either the GST-CD120a-(207–425) fusion protein or recombinant ATF-2 as substrate. For immunodepletion experiments, the cells were lysed as described above. The supernatants were precleared with 15 μl of protein A-Sepharose beads, and the MAPKs were immunoprecipitated by incubation at 4 °C for 2 h with 5 μg of p38 mapk, p42 mapk/erk2, and p46 jnk1 antibodies or non-immune rabbit IgG, and 25 μl of protein A-Sepharose beads. The beads were then spun down at 3000 rpm for 3 min, and the supernatants were transferred to a new tube, precleared with 20 μl of washed GST beads for 20 min at 4 °C, and incubated with 20 μl of washed GST-CD120a-(207–425) beads for 150 min at 4 °C on a rotator. After incubation, an in vitro kinase assay was conducted as described above. COS-7 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin G, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 2 mm glutamine. ∼2 × 105 COS-7 cells/well were seeded in 6-well (35 mm) dishes and grown in 7.5% CO2. Cells were transfected the following day using the LipofectAMINETM reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the recommendations of the manufacturer. 1.5 μg of DNA were transfected with 10 μl of LipofectAMINETM reagent in a total volume of 1 ml of Opti-MEM® I reduced serum medium (Life Technologies, Inc.). The amount of transfected DNA was kept constant with pcDNA3 empty vector. Eighteen h after transfection, the cells were washed with phosphate-free medium and metabolically labeled by incubation in phosphate-free Eagle's minimal essential medium containing 1 mCi of [32P]orthophosphate for 6 h. At the end of the incubation period, the cells were lysed in 250 μl of Nonidet P-40 buffer, and post-nuclear supernatants were precleared with 25 μl of protein A-Sepharose beads. CD120a (p55) was immunoprecipitated overnight at 4 °C with 10 μg of anti-CD120a (p55) antagonist monoclonal antibody and 50 μl of protein A-Sepharose beads. The beads were washed 12 times with Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer and resolved by SDS-PAGE. ∼105HeLa cells were seeded in 12-well plates containing 18-mm glass coverslips and grown in 5% CO2. Cells were transfected with 100 ng of DNA the following day using the LipofectAMINETM reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.). Fourteen h after transfection, the cells were washed with PBS, fixed for 15 min at room temperature in a solution containing 3% (w/v) paraformaldehyde and 3% (w/v) sucrose in PBS, pH 7.5, washed again, and permeabilized with 0.2% (v/v) Triton X-100 for 10 min. The cells were then washed, blocked for 30 min in Hank's balanced solution containing 10% normal donkey serum, and then incubated with the primary antibodies (1:100) in blocking solution for 2 h. After washing with PBS, the cells were incubated with Cy3-conjugated donkey anti-goat or Armenian hamster IgG and/or fluorescein-conjugated donkey anti-mouse IgG (1:200). The coverslips were washed with PBS, incubated overnight in PBS supplemented with 0.02% sodium azide, and mounted in a solution containing 90% glycerol, 10% Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, and 20 mg/mlo-phenylenediamine as an anti-fading agent. To stain the endogenous CD120a (p55), HeLa cells were stimulated with 0.1 μm okadaic acid for 150 min, transfected with 100 ng of DNA for 24 h, or left untreated. Cells were fixed and permeabilized as above, before being blocked for 60 min in Hank's balanced solution containing 5% normal donkey serum and 5% normal goat serum. Cells were then incubated for 2 h with the primary antibodies in blocking buffer (1:200 of anti-CD120a (p55) hamster monoclonal antibody or 1:200 of H57 anti-T-cell receptor hamster monoclonal antibody as a control). Cells were washed with PBS, incubated for 1 h with Cy3-conjugated goat anti-hamster IgG (1:200 in blocking buffer), washed, and then incubated for 1 h with Cy3-conjugated donkey anti-goat IgG (1:200 in blocking buffer). The coverslips were washed, incubated overnight in PBS, and mounted. To visualize the endoplasmic reticulum, cells were incubated with 5 μg/ml Alexa 488-conjugated concanavalin A (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) together with the secondary antibodies. The specificity of the secondary antibodies was checked to make sure they recognized only the appropriate primary antibody. DNA was stained with the Hoechst dye 33342 at 10 μg/ml. Cells were observed with a Leica DMR/XA confocal immunofluorescence microscope using a 100 × Plan objective. Digital images were captured using a SensiCam camera, deconvoluted using the software “Slidebook” (Intelligent Imaging Innovations, Inc., Denver, CO) to remove out of focus fluorescence, and processed using Adobe Photoshop 4.0 (Adobe Systems, Inc.). HeLa cell monolayers grown on Thermanox coverslips were fixed in 4% (w/v) paraformaldehyde and 0.05% (v/v) glutaraldehyde, permeabilized in 0.2% (v/v) Triton X-100, and blocked in 10% normal rabbit serum for 10 min at room temperature. The coverslips were incubated with goat anti-CD120a (p55) (1 μg/ml in blocking buffer) for 2 h at room temperature. After rinsing, bound antibody was detected using the Vector ABC Elite kit following the manufacturer's instructions. The coverslips were then post-stained with osmium tetroxide and uranyl acetate, dehydrated with graded solutions of ethanol, and embedded in plastic. Ultrathin sections were cut on a Reichert ultratome and examined in a Philips CM10 electron microscope at 80 kV. The TNF receptor CD120a (p55) is expressed in low abundance on all cell types studied, and macrophages are no exception (32Ding A.H. Sanchez E. Srimal S. Nathan C.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 3924-3929Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, to study the phosphorylation of CD120a (p55) we fused residues 207–425 which encode the entire intracellular domain of mouse CD120a (p55) to GST and expressed the GST-CD120-(207–425) fusion protein in Escherichia coli. The fusion protein was then bound to glutathione-Sepharose beads and was used to affinity purify receptor-interacting proteins from lysates of unstimulated and TNFα-stimulated mouse macrophages. Kinase(s) capable of phosphorylating GST-CD120a-(207–425) were then detected in an in vitro kinase assay. As can be seen in Figs. 2 and 3, incubation of mouse macrophages with TNFα (10 ng/ml for 10 min) led to the activation of a kinase activity that bound to and trans-phosphorylated the GST-CD120a-(207–425) fusion protein but not GST alone. The major phosphoprotein of ∼51 kDa co-localized with the GST-CD120a-(207–425) fusion protein. An additional phosphoprotein of retarded mobility, believed to be a multiply phosphorylated species of GST-CD120a-(207–425), was also detected.Figure 3p42 mapk/erk2 phosphorylates the GST-CD120a-(207–425) fusion protein in vitro. A, the three MAPKs were immunoprecipitated from detergent lysates of TNFα-stimulated macrophages using specific antibodies or non-immune rabbit IgG as a control. An immune complex kinase assay was performed, using either GST-CD120a-(207–425) beads or recombinant ATF-2 as a substrate. B, the active form of the recombinant p42 mapk/erk2 was incubated with GST or GST-CD120a-(207–425) beads; an in vitro kinase assay was performed directly or after the beads were washed extensively (last lane, *).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To begin to explore the possibility that p38 mapk, p42 mapk/erk2, or p46 jnk1 contributed to the phosphorylation of GST-CD120a-(207–425), we separated these MAPKs from lysates of TNFα-stimulated (10 ng/ml for 10 min) and unstimulated macrophages by fast protein liquid chromatography over a Mono-Q anion-exchange column and determined if CD120a-(207–425) kinase activity co-eluted with either p38 mapk, p42 mapk/erk2, or p46 jnk1. As can be seen in Fig.1 B, three peaks of kinase activity were detected in response to TNFα stimulation, and only two peaks were detected in lysates from unstimulated cells. The TNFα-inducible GST-CD120a-(207–425) kinase activity (peak 2) co-eluted with phosphorylated p42 mapk/erk2 as shown by immunoblotting with an antibody that recognized both phosphorylated p42 mapk/erk2 and p44 mapk/erk1 (Fig. 1 D). It can also be seen that p42 mapk/erk2 eluted at approximately 0.17m NaCl and was separated from p44 mapk/erk1. Peak 1 kinase activity eluted at the beginning of the linear NaCl gradient and did not co-localize with any of the MAPKs, whereas peak 3 kinase activity eluted at the beginning of the isocratic flow of 1m NaCl and co-eluted with p38 mapk (and probably other kinases) during this high salt wash. Based on the co-elution of CD120a-(207–425) kinase activity and p42 mapk/erk2, we next questioned if the TNFα-induced phosphorylation of GST-CD120a-(207–425) was dependent upon p42 mapk/erk2 by blocking its activation with a pharmacologic antagonist of MEK activation, PD098059 (33Dudley D.T.

The intermediate bands appeared at 370 nm (ε ∼ 1000), 420 nm (sh), and 670 nm (weak) within 15 ms, and were observable for ∼2 min at pH 7.4 but for less than 5 s at pH 4.2.

The intermediate was found to decay mainly from the protonated form by analyzing pH dependences. The enthalpy and entropy of activation suggested that a considerable structure change takes place around the active site during the decay of the intermediate.

Suzuki S. Messerschmidt A. Multi-Copper Oxidases. World Science, Singapore, Republic of Singapore1997: 225-250Crossref Google Scholar). Type I copper (blue copper) gives four charge transfer bands in the visible region, of which the band at 614 nm originating from Cys → Cu2+ is the strongest (ε = 5800 m−1 cm−1), and a very narrow hyperfine splitting (A ∥ = 4.3 × 10−3 cm−1) in the EPR1 spectrum. Type II copper (non-blue copper) is not coordinated by a soft ligand such as Cys and has a broad hyperfine splitting (A ∥ = 20.6 × 10−3cm−1) in the EPR spectrum. Type III coppers (EPR non-detectable copper) exhibit a 330-nm shoulder band and no EPR signal because of the strong antiferromagnetic interaction through a hydroxide ion.Spectroscopic studies on laccase, ascorbate oxidase, and ceruloplasmin combined with crystallographic studies (18Messerschmidt A.

Biol. 1989; 206: 513-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar) have generated a detailed description of the active site concerned with the catalytic function of them. Type I copper is four-coordinated and has the tetrahedrally distorted geometry. Type II copper is three-coordinated by two imidazoles and a water as ligands, but shows EPR spectral features for a tetragonal or slightly tetrahedrally distorted geometry (19Huang H. Sakurai T.

Biochem. 1999; 75: 19-25Crossref Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Paired type III coppers with highly tetrahedrally hindered geometry (21Sakurai T. Takahashi J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1248: 143-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) are coordinated by three histidines and a hydroxide or oxide ion as the bridging group. Type II and type III coppers are not bridged but located within 0.4 nm to form the trinuclear copper center (17Sakurai T. Suzuki S. Messerschmidt A. Multi-Copper Oxidases. World Science, Singapore, Republic of Singapore1997: 225-250Crossref Google Scholar) and thus bind and reduce dioxygen utilizing the electrons transferred from the type I copper site through the type I-Cys-His-type III pathway.The reactions concerned with laccase have been studied at the early stage of the studies about multicopper oxidases, and several reaction mechanisms have been proposed (7Mondovı́ B.

The intermediate was supposed to give an absorption band at 364 nm as a three-electron reduced oxyl radical or hydroxyl radical bound to one of type III coppers. Recently, the peroxide intermediate has been defined for the derivative of laccase in which the type I copper site was substituted by the redox-inactive Hg2+ (T1Hg) (25Shin W. Sundaram U.M. Cole J.L.

Soc. 1997; 119: 12525-12540Crossref Scopus (66) Google Scholar). This type of intermediate is extremely difficult to detect during the reoxidation process of the native enzyme or may not be the species present in the normal reaction process. One structural model of this intermediate showed the μ-1,1-peroxide ion bridging between one of the type III Cu2+ and type II Cu+ (25Shin W. Sundaram U.M. Cole J.L. Zhang H.H. Hedman B. Hodgson K.O. Solomon E.I. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1996; 118: 3202-3215Crossref Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Another model to give the μ3,(η1)3-peroxide intermediate was such that one oxygen atom bridges between both type III Cu2+ and another oxygen atom binds to type II Cu+ (26Sundaram U.M. Zhang H.H. Hedman B. Hodgson K.O. Solomon E.I. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1997; 119: 12525-12540Crossref Scopus (66) Google Scholar). However, since the third electron is apparently furnished from type I copper in the reaction of the native enzyme, the T1Hg derivative may give an artifactitious intermediate. Despite these pioneering studies, confusion is present about the structure of the two- and three-electron reduced oxygen intermediates because of deficiency of data. The four-electron reduction process of dioxygen by multicopper oxidase has not been fully established yet and awaits detailed investigation based on current structural information.Recently, we performed detailed EPR spectroscopy and SQUID measurements of laccase and ascorbate oxidase from cryogenic temperature to room temperature, and have shown that the magnetic interaction in the trinuclear copper center varies depending on temperature (19Huang H. Sakurai T. Monjushiro H. Takeda S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1384: 160-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 20Huang H. Sakurai T. Maritano S. Marchesini A. Suzuki S. J. Inorg. Biochem. 1999; 75: 19-25Crossref Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Based on this information about the trinuclear copper center, we investigated the reduction process of dioxygen in order to reveal the function of this unique metal center in multicopper oxidase using UV-visible, stopped-flow, EPR, and SQUID measurements.DISCUSSIONWhile a variety of spectroscopic techniques have been applied to laccase in order to reveal its structure and properties of the metal binding sites (16.Google Scholar, 17Sakurai T. Suzuki S. Messerschmidt A. Multi-Copper Oxidases. World Science, Singapore, Republic of Singapore1997: 225-250Crossref Google Scholar) to provide insight into the reaction mechanism (15Malkin R. Malmström B.G. Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas Mol. Biol. 1970; 33: 177-244PubMed Google Scholar), the four-electron reduction process of dioxygen has been a black box until recently. Some fragments of studies on the reaction mechanism have been performed by using stopped-flow and EPR spectroscopies for the native laccase (22Andréasson L.-E. Brändén R. Reihammar B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1976; 438: 370-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), the derivative in which type I copper was substituted by Hg2+ (T1Hg) and that in which type II copper was selectively depleted (T2D). In this study, we characterized the key intermediate species in detail by using stopped-flow, cryogenic EPR, and SQUID measurements, and proposed the mechanism whereby dioxygen is converted into two water molecules.The transition spectra during the four-electron reduction of dioxygen by laccase showed three bands at 370 nm, 420 nm and 670 nm (Fig. 1). The bands at 370 nm (ε ∼ 1000 m−1cm−1) and 420 nm (ε ∼ 550m−1 cm−1) decayed following the first-order process regardless of the enzyme concentration over the wide pH range 4.0–7.4, although it was difficult to follow the change of the band at 670 nm. The reactions of T1Hg with dioxygen by Shinet al. (25Shin W. Sundaram U.M. Cole J.L. Zhang H.H. Hedman B. Hodgson K.O. Solomon E.I. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1996; 118: 3202-3215Crossref Scopus (120) Google Scholar) showed the three bands at 340 nm (ε ∼ 3300 m−1 cm−1), 470 nm (ε ∼ 1200 m−1 cm−1), and 670 nm (ε ∼ 400 m−1 cm−1) originating from a peroxide intermediate. A hydroperoxide group has been supposed to bridge between type II copper and one of type III copper in the μ-1,1 fashion based on comparison with Cu2+-peroxo model spectra. Our intermediate spectrum was different from that of the peroxide intermediate and also from those of the other Cu2+ models and oxyhemocyanin. Unfortunately, no data are available for models of the copper-hydroxyl radical and copper-oxyl radical species. Nevertheless, a transient spectrum analogous to that we obtained in this study has been reported in the early kinetics study of laccase at pH 7.4 by Andreasson et al. (22Andréasson L.-E. Brändén R. Reihammar B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1976; 438: 370-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), although they proposed a different reaction mechanism (see below). Another important fact of the transient system is that the absorptions at 614 nm and 330 nm have already been recovered, indicating that type I copper and type III coppers have finished to donating electrons to dioxygen. The appearance of the 330-nm band indicates that type III coppers are bridged by OH− or O2−.The pH dependence of the decay process of the intermediate bands has shown increasingly acceleration with decreasing pH (Fig. 2). The apparent isotope effect was observed in deuterium oxide (kH /kD = 1.4–1.5 irrespective of pH and pD), and it appeared that a certain proton transfer process is coupled with the decay of the intermediate (a certain proton transfer process and/or hydrogen bounding(s) might be involved in the rate-determining step). Analyses of the kinetics results based on several schemes indicated that there is an equilibrium between the unprotonated form and the protonated form for the intermediate. (This proton transfer is strongly coupled with the electron transfer of the intermediate. Since type I and type III coppers have already been oxidized, type II copper is the only candidate as the electron source as evidenced by the EPR spectra in Fig. 5 A.) It was found that the prior proton transfer facilitates the electron transfer, although the simultaneous proton and electron transfers also take place. While Scheme 3 was the best among all four schemes to account for the prominent accelerated decay of the intermediate with decreasing pH, the simulation for the neutral pH region higher than pH 5 could be admirably simulated according to Scheme 4 to give a sigmoidal curve. The increasing acceleration of the decay of the intermediate below pH 5 might have been brought about by a certain loosening of the protein structure. The decay rate of the intermediate (k obs = 2.1 s−1,t 1/2 = 0.33 s at pH 4 andk obs = 0.058 s−1,t 1/2 = 12 s at pH 7.4) was much faster than that of the hydroperoxide intermediate in T1Hg (k obs = 0.60 min−1,t 1/2 = 1.2 min at pH 4 andk obs = 0.013 min−1,t 1/2 = 12 s at pH 7.4) (see Ref. 25Shin W. Sundaram U.M. Cole J.L. Zhang H.H. Hedman B. Hodgson K.O. Solomon E.I. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1996; 118: 3202-3215Crossref Scopus (120) Google Scholar). This peculiar difference is considered to be brought about by the fact that the third electron donor is type II copper in the case of T1Hg but is type I copper in the case of the native enzyme.The enthalpy of activation and the entropy of activation for the decay of the intermediate were considerably large positive and negative values, respectively, indicating that the decay of the radical intermediate is accompanied by an appreciable structure change around the active site of laccase and/or activation barriers associate with the decay of the intermediate are high. The possible protonation from a certain amino acid residue to the oxyl radical and deformations leading to the resting form could be the causes of these large activation parameters. The copper-copper distances in the trinuclear center in ascorbate oxidase are 0.41–0.51 nm in the reduced form, but decrease to 0.34–0.40 nm in the resting form (18Messerschmidt A. Rossi A. Ladenstein R. Huber R. Bolognesi M. Gatti G. Marchesini A. Petruzzelli R. Finazzi-Agro A. J. Mol. Biol. 1989; 206: 513-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar, 23Messerschmidt A. Luecke H. Huber R. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 230: 997-1014Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar).The redox potential of type I copper and type II copper in the resting laccase have been determined to be 394 and 365 mV, respectively (1Reihammar B.R.M. Vänngård T.I. Eur. J. Biochem. 1971; 18: 463-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The experimental fact that the electron transfer from type I copper to oxygen has already finished and the forth electron is transferred from type II copper to the radical intermediate (evidenced by the EPR measurements) is contradictory relative to the driving forces. In addition, the distance between type I copper and the trinuclear copper center is ∼1.3 nm. The reason that the electron transfer from type I copper takes place before that from type II copper could be caused by that the redox potential of each copper site (38Spira-Solomon D.J. Solomon E.I. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1987; 109: 6421-6432Crossref Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 39Langen R. Jensen G.M. Jacob U. Stephens P.J. Warshel A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25625-25627Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) changes under turnover conditions. To support this, the redox potentials of the trinucelar copper center easily change by acting the exogenous ligands such as N3− and F− (12Hirose J. Inoue K. Sakuragi H. Kikkawa M. Minakami M. Morikawa T. Iwamoto H. Hiromi K. Inorg. Chim. Acta. 1998; 273: 204-212Crossref Google Scholar) and by the mutations for ligand groups (13Shimizu A. Kwon J.H. Sasaki T. Satoh T. Sakurai N. Sakurai T. Yamaguchi S. Samejima T. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 3034-3042Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 40Malmström B.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 223: 711-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar, 41Ducros V. Brzozowski A.M. Wilson K.S. Brown S.H. Østergaard P. Schneider P. Yaver D.S. Pedersen A.H. Davies G.J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 310-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). Alternatively, the redox potential of the type II copper in T1Hg might shift toward a more positive potential than that in the native laccase. The fact, the electron transfer from type II copper to the oxyl and hydroxyl radical is relatively slow (k obs = 0.1–1.6 s−1) suggests the possibility that the type II copper might not be oxidized when excess substrates and dioxygen are present. In this case, the role of type II copper is simply to assist the binding of dioxygen and/or to stabilize the intermediate.In harmony with the appearance and decay of the intermediate in the transient spectra, two broad EPR signals could be detected at g = 1.83 and 1.61 at cryogenic temperatures below 27 K. The former is similar to that reported by Andreasson et al. (22Andréasson L.-E. Brändén R. Reihammar B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1976; 438: 370-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), being assigned to be a certain radical species derived from dioxygen. The isotope effect using 17O2 supported the assignment by Aasa et al. (24Aasa R. Brändén R. Deinum J. Malmström B.G. Reihammar B. Vänngård T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1976; 70: 1204-1209Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The g = 1.83 signal was detected at pH 6, but both signals were apparent at pH 7.4, suggesting that the radical species is in an equilibrium with H+. This is consistent with the kinetic results for Schemes 3 and 4. We tentatively assign the g = 1.83 species as being associated with the hydroxyl radical and the g = 1.61 species with the oxyl radical. No Cu2+ model compound bound by a hydroxyl radical or oxyl radical has been prepared to support the assignment. This EPR-detectable species can not be an isolated radical but is intimately interacted with the partly oxidized trinuclear copper center. The S = 1/2 or even S = 3/2 state from a three-spin system may be the origin of these signals. Only EPR spectroscopy might have been possible to directly discriminate the hydroxyl radical and oxyl radical, the difference of which is only the protonation.The magnetic property of the intermediate was also characterized by the magnetic susceptibility measured using a SQUID magnetometer (Fig. 6). Contribution from only the radical-bound trinuclear copper center could be obtained, since type I copper and the already fully reoxidized laccase obeyed the Curie law (19Huang H. Sakurai T. Monjushiro H. Takeda S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1384: 160-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 20Huang H. Sakurai T. Maritano S. Marchesini A. Suzuki S. J. Inorg. Biochem. 1999; 75: 19-25Crossref Scopus (11) Google Scholar). As for the resting form of laccase, the type I copper site is magnetically isolated, and type II and a pair of type III coppers (the antiferromagnetic interaction between them is very strong (−2 J > 400 cm−1) (19Huang H. Sakurai T. Monjushiro H. Takeda S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1384: 160-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar,20Huang H. Sakurai T. Maritano S. Marchesini A. Suzuki S. J. Inorg. Biochem. 1999; 75: 19-25Crossref Scopus (11) Google Scholar) form the trinuclear center with S = 1/2. In contrast, the radical-bound trinuclear center in the intermediate has more than one spin, 1/2 < S <3/2. The magnetic susceptibility due to the transient species could be simulated by three models, in which the intermediate radical is bound to one or both of type III coppers. It is not certain whether the radical is bound to type II copper, which is apparently EPR-undetectable in the intermediate species (type II copper is in a cuprous state, while the possibility that the oxygen radical and the type II cupric ion interact to give S = 0 and S = 2 states is not completely excluded; in this case, no fourth electron donor is present). It seems to be difficult to discriminate which model is the most probable, although it is certain that the intermediate contains the complex three-spin system. Otherwise, these two or three forms might be in equilibrium in the intermediate, as detected by a small amount of type 3 copper EPR signal at 345 nm in the transient state (this is possible when the interaction in Fig. 6 C (3Bligny R. Douce R. Biochem. J. 1983; 209: 489-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) contributes).Taking all information described above into consideration, we present the reaction scheme in Fig. 7 for the four-electron reduction process of dioxygen at the trinuclear copper center in laccase. In the intermediate, type I and type III coppers are oxidized and both type III coppers have already been bridged by a hydroxide ion or an oxide ion (23Messerschmidt A. Luecke H. Huber R. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 230: 997-1014Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). As for the proton source to form water or hydroxide ion, bulk water or certain amino acid(s) near the active site is the candidate. It has been pointed out by Karlinet al. (42Karlin K.D. Zhu Z.-Y. Karlin S. J. Biol. Inorg. Chem. 1998; 3: 172-187Crossref Scopus (16) Google Scholar) that several acidic amino acids are present in the second coordination sphere of the trinuclear copper center in ascorbate oxidase. The sigmoidal simulation curve obtained in Fig.3 B suggests an amino acid having the pK a value of 5.4 is the proton donor to the oxyl radical intermediate. We concluded that the intermediate radicals are in equilibrium with H+ depending on pH. Although we have not yet determined the two-electron reduced species, we suppose that dioxygen is bound to type III coppers in the μ-η2,η2 fashion as in oxyhemocyanin. By taking this binding form, one of the oxygen atoms is smoothly converted to the bridging hydroxide ion (or oxide ion) and another to the radical species bound to the trinuclear center. The reaction is completed by transferring the final electron to the intermediate radical to form a hydroxide ion or a water molecule bound to type II copper. This non-protein ligand is exchangeable with the bulk water in the resting laccase (43Goldberg M. Vuk-Pavlovic S. Pecht I. Biochemistry. 1980; 19: 5181-5189Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). As for the peroxide-bound form of the resting ascorbate oxidase, the end-on binding fashion was shown by Messerschmidt et al. (23Messerschmidt A. Luecke H. Huber R. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 230: 997-1014Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar) from the x-ray crystallography. However, in the peroxide-ascorbate oxidase, all coppers are in the oxidized form differing from the turnover condition and it is not certain whether the binding mode of dioxygen in laccase is similar to that of the peroxide-ascorbate oxidase or to that of oxyhemocyanin. Further study is necessary to detect the two-electron reduced form, although it seems to be very difficult because the third electron transfer is very rapid compared with the binding of dioxygen to the trinuclear center and the fourth electron transfer to the radical species.CONCLUSIONThe intermediate radical species was detected during the four-electron reduction process of dioxygen by laccase and characterized on the basis of the spectroscopic and magnetic properties. The intermediate showed different spectral features from those of the peroxide intermediate reported for T1Hg. The hydroxyl and oxyl radicals in the equilibrium depending on pH are bound to the trinuclear copper center, in which type III coppers have already been bridged by a hydroxide ion. Type II copper is still in the reduced form. The intermediate radical magnetically interacts with the nearby type III coppers to give the broad EPR signals with the g values much smaller than 2.0023. The decay process of the radical species due to the electron transfer from type II copper was found to closely couple with the proton transfer. Therefore, the successful detection and the detailed characterization of the O-centered radical was realized because the proton transfer controls the final electron transfer during the four-electron reduction process of dioxygen. Laccase (diphenol:dioxygen oxidoreductase) as a member of multicopper oxidase is divided into two categories: plant (1Reihammar B.R.M. Vänngård T.I. Eur. J.

Saraste M. Wikström M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 197: 699-705Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). It is also a typical proton-pumping heme-copper oxidase and is encoded by thectaCDEF genes (15Saraste M. Metso T. Nakari T. Jalli T. Lauraeus M. van der Oost J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 195: 517-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Cytochrome bd can be found inB. subtilis cells grown with glucose (11Lauraeus M. Wikström M. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 3936-3942Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). ThecydAB genes of the cydABCD operon encode the two subunits of cytochrome bd (19Winstedt L. Yoshida K. Fujita Y. von Wachenfeldt C. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 6571-6580Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The B. subtilisstrain 168 genome sequence also contains genes, ythAB, that seem to encode a second cytochrome bd (19Winstedt L. Yoshida K. Fujita Y. von Wachenfeldt C. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 6571-6580Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 20Kunst F. Ogasawara N. Moszer I. Albertini A.M. Alloni G. Asevedo V. Bertero M.G. Bessieres P. Bolotin A. Borchert S. et al.Nature. 1997; 390: 249-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (3087) Google Scholar). Cytochromebd has recently been isolated from Bacillus stearothermophilus (21Sakamoto J. Matsumoto A. Oobuchi K. Sone N. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1996; 143: 151-158Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and Bacillus firmus OF4 (22Gilmour R. Krulwich T.A. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 863-870Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), but the B. subtilis enzyme has not yet been isolated or characterized in any detail. In addition to these three identified oxygen-activating cytochrome complexes, there is experimental evidence pointing to the presence of a fourth terminal oxidase in B. subtilis. A heme protein with spectral characteristics of cytochrome o was partly purified from strain W23 (23de Vrij W. van den Burg B. Konings W.N. Eur. J. Biochem. 1987; 166: 589-595Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). It showedN,N,N′,N′-tetramethyl-p-phenylenediamine (TMPD) and some low cytochrome c oxidase activity that was relatively resistant to cyanide (I50 = 200 μm). Heme O is an intermediate in the synthesis of heme A from heme B and does not accumulate in B. subtilis unless the final step in heme A synthesis is impaired (24Svensson B. Lübben M. Hederstedt L. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 10: 193-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Since the absorption characteristics of hemes O and B are rather similar (25Puustinen A. Wikström M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 6122-6126Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar), it is possible that the “cytochrome o” found in strain W23 (23de Vrij W. van den Burg B. Konings W.N. Eur. J. Biochem. 1987; 166: 589-595Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) was in fact a high spin b-type cytochrome. A 17-kDa CO-reactive cytochrome b has been purified from strain 168 of B. subtilis (11Lauraeus M. Wikström M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11470-11473Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This cytochrome did not exhibit TMPD- or cytochrome c-oxidase activity (<1.5 s−1) and was considered unlikely to be a terminal oxidase. The cytochrome preparations mentioned above were reported to lack quinol oxidase activity. However, this could be due to the nonoptimal quinols used as electron donors. The respiratory enzymes in B. subtilis are known to operate much better with the low potential naphthoquinoles such as dimethylnaphthoquinol (14Lemma E. Simon J. Schägger H. Kröger A. Arch. Microbiol. 1995; 163: 432-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 26Lemma E. Hägerhäll C. Geisler V. Brandt U. von Jagow G. Kröger A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1059: 281-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 27Lemma E. Unden G. Kröger A. Arch. Microbiol. 1990; 155: 62-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) than with menadiol or benzoquinol derivatives. Lemma et al. (14Lemma E. Simon J. Schägger H. Kröger A. Arch. Microbiol. 1995; 163: 432-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) reported that a mutant of B. subtilis W23 deleted for the qoxB gene and grown with glucose did not contain cytochromes a or d, as determined from optical absorption spectra, but showed significant quinol oxidase activity with dimethylnaphthoquinol as the electron donor. This led the authors to suggest the existence of an additional unidentified QOX in B. subtilis, possibly of the cytochromeo type. Similar observations have been made by Villaniet al. (12Villani G. Tattoli M. Capitanio N. Glaser P. Papa S. Danchin A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1232: 67-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) with a B. subtilis mutant lacking the entire qoxABCD operon. We considered it worthwhile to carry out a more systematic investigation of the putative fourth terminal oxidase in B. subtilis. In order to have a convenient experimental model, we constructed a mutant of strain 168, LUH27, lacking the structural genes for aa 3-QOX, caa 3-COX, and succinate:menaquinone oxidoreductase. Deficiency in the twoaa 3-type terminal oxidases was expected not only to eliminate their contribution to respiratory activity and absorption spectra but also to stimulate expression of alternative oxygen-activating enzymes. Succinate:menaquinone oxidoreductase was removed mainly because the diheme cytochromeb 558 in this enzyme dominates the absorption spectra of wild type membranes (5Hägerhäll C. Aasa R. von Wachenfeldt C. Hederstedt L. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 7411-7421Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). B. subtilis mutants deleted for genes encoding cytochrome bd andaa 3 -QOX, i.e. cydABCD and qoxABCD, can only be grown anaerobically (28von Wachenfeldt C. Winstedt L. EBEC Short Rep. 1998; 10: 103Google Scholar). However, by growing strain LUH27 under different conditions, the content of cytochrome bd in the cells can be varied more than 10-fold, and cells with barely detectable levels of this oxidase can be obtained. This work reports results from our initial studies with strain LUH27. Aurachin D was a kind gift of Prof. Peter Rich (University College, London) obtained through the courtesy of Dr. Jeff Osborne (University of Illinois, Urbana-Champain, IL). A CO cylinder (“for synthesis” grade) was purchased from Merck. Other chemicals were commercial products of high purity from conventional sources (Sigma, Serva, Fluka, and Merck). The 2.8-kilobase pairythABC region of the B. subtilis chromosome was amplified by polymerase chain reaction using DNA from strain 1A1 (trpC2) as template, the oligonucleotides 5′-CCGGATCCTTCCCTCTGTTTCACATCGTA-3′ (BamHI site underlined) and 5′-GGTCTAGATCTTTTAATTATAAATCATGCGGC-3′(XbaI site underlined), and the Expand high fidelity polymerase chain reaction system (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The polymerase chain reaction product was digested with BamHI and XbaI, ligated to pHPSK (29Johansson P. Hederstedt L. Microbiology. 1999; 145: 529-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), and used to transform B. subtilis strain 168 (trpC2) to chloramphenicol resistance. The resulting plasmid containing the ythABC genes and flanking regions was named pYTH1. B. subtilis strain 168 was transformed to phleomycin resistance with chromosomal DNA from strain JO1, which contains a ΔctaCD::bledeletion (30van der Oost J. von Wachenfeldt C. Hederstedt L. Saraste M. Mol. Microbiol. 1991; 5: 2063-2072Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The resulting strain, LUH15 (trpC2ΔctaCD::ble), was then transformed to chloramphenicol resistance with strain 3G18Δ12 DNA containing aΔsdhCA′::cat mutation (31Fridén H. Hederstedt L. Rutberg L. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1987; 41: 203-206Crossref Scopus (8) Google Scholar). One transformant was kept and named LUH19 (trpC2 ΔctaCD::ble ΔsdhCA′::cat). The triple respiratory deficient mutant LUH27 (trpC2 ΔctaCD::ble ΔsdhCA′::cat ΔqoxABCD::kan) was obtained by the transformation of strain LUH19 to neomycin resistance with chromosomal DNA from a strain containing a ΔqoxABCD::kan mutation (12Villani G. Tattoli M. Capitanio N. Glaser P. Papa S. Danchin A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1232: 67-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). To construct aythAB deletion mutant, a 740-base pairHindIII–PvuII fragment of pYTH1, containing part of ythB and ythC, was ligated to pDG1515 (32Guérout-Fleury A.-M. Shazand K. Frandsen N. Stragier P. Gene (Amst.). 1995; 167: 335-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar) that had been digested with XhoI, treated with the large fragment (Klenow) of Escherichia coli DNA polymerase I, and digested with HindIII. The resulting plasmid was named pYTH10. A part of ythA on pYTH1 was excised as a 470-base pair BamHI–PstI fragment and ligated to pYTH10 that had been digested with the same enzymes. The resulting plasmid was used to transform strain 168 to tetracycline resistance, resulting in LUW122. The substitution of the ythAB::tet allele for the wild-type ythAB genes (as a result of double-crossover homologous recombination) in strain LUW122 was confirmed by Southern blot analysis. Strain LUW123 (trpC2 ΔythAB::tet ΔctaCD::ble ΔsdhCA::cat ΔqoxABCD::kan) was obtained by transforming LUH27 with chromosomal DNA isolated from LUW122. Transformations were performed essentially as described by Hoch (33Hoch J.A. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 204: 305-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar), and transformants were selected on tryptose blood agar base plates containing chloramphenicol (4 or 5 mg/liter), phleomycin (3 mg/liter), neomycin (5 mg/liter), or tetracyclin (15 mg/liter) as appropriate. The yeast extract medium with phosphate (YMP) used in this work is the same as the nutrient broth sporulation medium with phosphate (34Hederstedt L. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 126: 399-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) except that the nutrient broth was replaced by 0.5% (w/v) yeast extract (Difco). Where indicated, 0.5% (w/v) glucose was added. The cells were grown at 37 °C on a rotary shaker at 200 rpm in 5-liter indented flasks containing 1 or 2 liters of medium for high or low aeration conditions, respectively. Cultures were harvested at the end of the exponential phase (A 600 was 1.5 and 0.4–0.5 for the growth with and without glucose, respectively). In the case of proton pumping experiments, the phosphate concentration in the growth medium was decreased to 5 mm, which was verified not to influence the cytochrome composition of the cells. Membranes were isolated as described before (34Hederstedt L. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 126: 399-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) and stored suspended in 20 mm MOPS buffer, pH 7.4, at −70 °C. Protein was determined using the BCA protein assay reagent (Pierce). Heme composition of membranes was assayed by reverse-phase high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) as described before (24Svensson B. Lübben M. Hederstedt L. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 10: 193-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Conventional optical absorption difference spectra were recorded using a SLM-Aminco DW-2000 UV-visible spectrophotometer operating in split beam mode and standard rectangular glass cuvettes with a 10-mm light path. Unless indicated otherwise, the slit width was 3 nm and the scan rate was 2 nm/s. The experiments were performed in M1 medium (100 mm MOPS, 0.2 mmEDTA, pH 7.0) at a final membrane concentration of 1–5 mg of protein/ml. For “reduced minus oxidized” difference spectra, the aerobically preincubated sample was considered to be “fully oxidized.” Reduction of the samples was achieved by the addition of a few grains of solid sodium dithionite. An extinction coefficient of Δε630–650 = 17 mm−1 cm−1 (52Jünemann S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1321: 107-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar) was used to evaluate the concentration of cytochrome bd in the membranes from the “dithionite reduced minus aerobically oxidized” difference absorption spectra. Flash-induced dissociation of CO and kinetics of its subsequent recombination with membrane-bound cytochromes were measured in a single beam spectrophotometer constructed by Prof. L. A. Drachev at the A. N. Belozersky Institute of Physico-Chemical Biology, Moscow State University. Monitoring light from a 75-watt halogen lamp aligned perpendicular to the excitation beam from the laser was filtered through a grating monochromator and passed through the sample positioned in a thermostated 10 × 10-mm rectangular quartz cell with four optically transparent sides. Upon exiting the sample cuvette, the monitoring light beam was sent via a second monochromator (prism) to a photomultiplier. A glass color filter was placed before the second monochromator in order to absorb scattered laser light. The signal from the photomultiplier, passed through an appropriate RC filter (10 μs to 1 ms depending on the reaction rate), was recorded with a PC-interfaced digital transient recorder (Datalab-1080). CO was added to anaerobic dithionite-reduced membranes as small volumes of CO-saturated buffer with dithionite. Photodissociation of CO was induced by 10-ns light pulses from a neodimium YAG laser Quantel 481 operated in a doubled frequency mode (λ = 532 nm). Exponential decay curve fitting was done with the software package GIM (Graphic Interactive Management) developed by A. L. Drachev. Oxygen consumption was monitored amperometrically with a Clark-type oxygen electrode at 25 °C in M1 medium containing 0.1–0.3 mg/ml of membrane protein. The assay was initiated by the addition of a substrate. In the case of the quinol oxidase assays, dithiothreitol (DTT) and Q2 were added together from a stock mixture in which full reduction of Q2 had been verified spectrophotometrically. Proton pumping was assayed using the “oxygen pulse” method as described in Ref. 12Villani G. Tattoli M. Capitanio N. Glaser P. Papa S. Danchin A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1232: 67-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, except that KSCN was replaced by valinomycin. Fig. 1 shows typical difference absorption spectra (reduced minus oxidized) of membranes from strain LUH27 grown without glucose at high aeration (A) or with glucose at low aeration (B). The membranes do not show any evidence for the presence of heme A-containing oxidases but contain cytochrome bd. Growth of LUH27 with glucose plus oxygen limitation resulted in an approximate 10-fold increase of the cytochrome bd-specific content of the membranes (from about 0.04 to about 0.4 nmol/mg of protein). These two types of preparations are referred to below as bd − andbd + membranes. The line shapes of the difference spectra of thebd − and bd + membranes are distinctly different in the far red region (Fig. 1 C). First, a trough at about 650 nm typical of the reduction-induced decay of heme D oxycomplex (trace b) is barely visible in the spectrum of the bd − membranes (trace a); this could indicate that heme D in the aerobic bd − membranes is largely in the oxidized rather than the oxygenated state. Second, the difference spectrum of the bd − membranes reveals an approximate 3-fold higher relative contribution (plus some band shift to the red) of the component absorbing around 600 nm (presumably heme b595). Analysis of the hemes extracted from bd − membranes showed the presence of heme B, as expected, but no heme A or O could be detected (Fig. 2). Therefore, thebd − membranes cannot contain abo-type terminal oxidase. The results of the heme analysis also show that the absorption maximum at 600 nm in the reduced minus oxidized difference spectrum of the bd −membranes (Fig. 1 C, trace a) is not due to heme A and rather belongs to high spin heme b. Oxygen consumption bybd − and bd + membranes with different electron donors and the effects of some inhibitors are shown in Table I. The rate of respiration with NADH as the substrate did not depend significantly on the cytochrome bd content. This observation could indicate that a terminal oxidase other than cytochrome bd is responsible for oxygen consumption in the bd − samples.Table IRespiratory activity of LUH27 bd − membranesAdditionsRate of respiration (ng atoms O/min/mg of protein)NADH91 (108)DTT6 With NaCN1.0 With aurachin D<0.2 Boiled membranes<0.2DTT With 0.1 mmQ27 (10) With 0.5 mm Q214 With 1.0 mm Q221DTT plus 0.1 mm Q27 (10) With NaCN1.7 With aurachin D0.5Where indicated, the numbers in parentheses give the activities measured under the same conditions with the bd +membranes. The concentrations used were as follows: NADH, 0.3 mm; DTT, 5 mm; KCN, 1 mm; aurachin D, 40 μm. The membranes were preincubated with aurachin D for 10 min before the addition of the electron donor.

Quinol oxidase activities of bd − andbd + membranes were compared using oxidation of DTT as stimulated by Q2. DTT and reduced Q2 are rather poor electron donors for the B. subtilis respiratory system as compared with NADH or to dimethylnaphthoquinol (14Lemma E. Simon J. Schägger H. Kröger A. Arch. Microbiol. 1995; 163: 432-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 26Lemma E. Hägerhäll C. Geisler V. Brandt U. von Jagow G. Kröger A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1059: 281-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), but nevertheless, the reaction is likely to report on the quinol oxidase activity of the membranes. The DTT-supported oxygen consumption was stimulated by Q2, inhibited by cyanide and aurachin D, and abolished by heat inactivation of the membranes. Notably, at the same concentrations of Q2 and DTT, the specific respiratory activities of bd − andbd + samples were very similar in agreement with the similar NADH-oxidase activities. Both types of membranes catalyzed oxygen consumption with ascorbate either alone or with mediators such as TMPD and cytochromec. However, this activity of the preparations is probably of nonenzymatic origin, since it was resistant to cyanide, partly sensitive to EDTA, and could be observed also with boiled membranes. As shown in Table II, the NADH-dependent respiration of the two types of membranes differ in sensitivity to inhibitors. Oxygen consumption by thebd − membranes was considerably more sensitive to cyanide. Interpolation of the data in the Dixon coordinates (1/v versus [inhibitor]; not shown) gives I50values of about 120 and 550 μm for thebd − and bd + membranes, respectively. The bd − membranes were also more sensitive to aurachin D, an antibiotic known to inhibit preferentiallybd-QOX, probably at the quinol-binding site (35Jünemann S. Wrigglesworth J.M. Rich P.R.

https://openalex.org/W2019482161,"Transgenic or tumoral pancreatic islet beta cells with enhanced expression of low K m hexokinases (HK) exhibit a leftward shift of the normal dose-response curve for glucose-induced insulin release. Furthermore, HK catalyzes roughly 50% of total glucose phosphorylation measured in extracts from freshly isolated rodent islets, suggesting that HK participates in the process of glucose sensing in beta cells. We previously observed that HK activity represents 20% of total glucose phosphorylation in purified rat beta cell preparations and that HK is not homogenously distributed over these cells. The present study provides several arguments for the idea that HK detected in freshly isolated rat islets or islet cell preparations originates mainly from contaminating exocrine cells. First, reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction using isoform-specific primers allowed detection of hexokinase I and IV mRNA in rat beta cells, whereas the messenger levels encoding the hexokinase II and III isoforms were undetectably low. However, immunoblots indicated that hexokinase I protein was 10-fold more abundant in freshly isolated islets and flow-sorted exocrine cells than in purified rat beta cell preparations. Second, comparison of HK activity in the different pancreatic cell types resulted in 15–25-fold higher values in exocrine than in endocrine cells (acinar cells: 21 ± 3 pmol of glucose 6-phosphate formed/h/ng of DNA; duct cells: 30 ± 8 pmol/h/ng of DNA; islet beta cells: 1.2 ± 0.2 pmol/h/ng DNA; alpha cells: 0.9 ± 0.4 pmol/h/ng of DNA). Since freshly purified beta cell preparations contain 3 ± 1% exocrine cells, at least 50% of their HK activity can be accounted for by exocrine contamination. Third, after 5 days of culture of purified islet beta cells, both HK activity and the proportion of exocrine cells decreased by more than 1 order of magnitude, while the ratio of glucokinase over hexokinase activity increased more than 10-fold. Finally, preincubating the cells with 50 mmol/liter 2-deoxyglucose did not affect glucose stimulation of insulin biosynthesis and release. In conclusion, the observation that pancreatic exocrine cells are responsible for a major part of HK activity in islet cell preparations cautions against the use of HK measurements in islet extracts in the study of these enzymes in glucose sensing by pancreatic beta cells. Transgenic or tumoral pancreatic islet beta cells with enhanced expression of low K m hexokinases (HK) exhibit a leftward shift of the normal dose-response curve for glucose-induced insulin release.

Third, after 5 days of culture of purified islet beta cells, both HK activity and the proportion of exocrine cells decreased by more than 1 order of magnitude, while the ratio of glucokinase over hexokinase activity increased more than 10-fold. Finally, preincubating the cells with 50 mmol/liter 2-deoxyglucose did not affect glucose stimulation of insulin biosynthesis and release. In conclusion, the observation that pancreatic exocrine cells are responsible for a major part of HK activity in islet cell preparations cautions against the use of HK measurements in islet extracts in the study of these enzymes in glucose sensing by pancreatic beta cells. hexokinases I, II, or III bovine serum albumin fluorescence-activated cell sorting glucose 6-phosphate hexokinase IV (glucokinase) polymerase chain reaction Differentiated pancreatic beta cells isolated from both rodents (1Pipeleers D. Diabetologia. 1987; 30: 277-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar) and man (2Ling Z. Pipeleers D.G. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 2805-2812Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar) possess the capacity to rapidly respond to changes in extracellular glucose concentration between 3 and 20 mmol/liter with adapted rates of proinsulin biosynthesis and insulin release. In addition to the rapid onset of these cellular processes, both the inactivity at basal glucose (below 3 mmol/liter) and the steep concentration-dependent activation at glucose levels between 5 and 10 mmol/liter are considered important aspects of the glucose-regulation of beta cells (3Matschinsky F.M. Diabetes. 1996; 45: 223-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). It is well known that such regulatory properties of glucose proceed via metabolic steps in beta cells, comprising the uptake and phosphorylation of the sugar (4Newgard C.B. McGarry J.D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 689-719Crossref PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation in islets is mediated by two classes of isoenzymes (5Matschinsky F.M. Ellerman J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1968; 243: 2730-2736Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,6Ashcroft S.J.H. Randle P.J. Biochem. J. 1970; 119: 5-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), hexokinases I-III (HK)1and glucokinase (GK), which can be distinguished biochemically by their molecular mass, enzyme kinetics, and allosteric properties (7Iynedjian P.B. Biochem. J. 1995; 293: 231-243Google Scholar). The concept that GK plays a crucial physiological role in glucose recognition by mammalian beta cells has been documented extensively (for review, see Ref. 3Matschinsky F.M. Diabetes. 1996; 45: 223-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). Furthermore, genetically determined abnormalities in GK structure or protein expression levels are the cause of abnormal insulin secretion caused by abnormal threshold concentration for glucose-stimulated insulin release, both in transgenic animals (8Grupe A. Hultgren B. Ryan A. Ma Y.H. Bauer M. Stewart T.A. Cell. 1995; 83: 69-78Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar) and man (9Froguel Ph. Zouali H. Vionnet N. Velho G. Vaxillaire M. Sun F. Lesage S. Stoffel M. Takeda J. Passa Ph. Permutt A. Beckmann J.S. Bell G.I. Cohen D. N. Engl. J. Med. 1993; 328: 697-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (716) Google Scholar, 10Glaser B. Kesavan P.

Depending on the shift of such threshold, these mutations can be the cause of diabetes (8Grupe A. Hultgren B. Ryan A. Ma Y.H. Bauer M. Stewart T.A. Cell. 1995; 83: 69-78Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar, 9Froguel Ph. Zouali H. Vionnet N. Velho G. Vaxillaire M. Sun F. Lesage S. Stoffel M. Takeda J. Passa Ph. Permutt A. Beckmann J.S. Bell G.I. Cohen D. N. Engl. J. Med. 1993; 328: 697-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (716) Google Scholar) or familial hyperinsulinism (10Glaser B. Kesavan P. Heyman M. Davis E. Cuesta A. Buchs A. Stanley C.A. Thornton P.S. Permutt M.A. Matschinsky F.M. Herold K.C. N. Engl. J. Med. 1998; 338: 226-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar). Strikingly, in extracts of mouse (5Matschinsky F.M. Ellerman J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1968; 243: 2730-2736Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Ashcroft S.J.H. Randle P.J. Biochem. J. 1970; 119: 5-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) and rat (11Malaisse W.J. Sener A. Levy J. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 1731-1737Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) islets, at least 50% of total glucose phosphorylation seems to be catalyzed by HK. On basis of this high activity on the one hand and because of the observation that up-regulation of hexokinase expression in tumoral or transgenic beta cells causes a leftward shift of the normal concentration-dependent activation of glucose-induced insulin release on the other hand (12German M.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 1781-1785Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar, 13Ishihara H. Asano T. Tsukuda K. Katagiri H. Inukai K. Anai M. Kikuchi M. Yazaki Y. Miyazaki J.I. Oka Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3081-3087Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the possibility has been considered that low K m hexokinases influence the process of glucose sensing, for instance, by decreasing the threshold for glucose-induced insulin release or increasing insulin secretion at basal plasma glucose levels. Four studies may be interpreted along this view. First, Heimberg et al. (14Heimberg H. De Vos A. Vandercammen A. Van Schaftingen E. Pipeleers D. Schuit F. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2873-2879Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar) noted that hexokinase activity was associated with a rat beta cell subset with high sensitivity to glucose, prepared by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) on the basis of glucose-induced changes in NAD(P)H autofluorescence (15Kiekens R. in't Veld P. Mahler T. Schuit F. Van De Winkel M. Pipeleers D. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 89: 117-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar), which could indicate that lowK m glucose phosphorylation sets the threshold point for glucose-induced beta cell activation. Second, Hosokawa et al. (16Hosakowa H. Hosakowa Y.A. Leahy J.L. Diabetes. 1995; 44: 1328-1333Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) observed that islets isolated from 90% pancreatectomized rats exhibited more than 2-fold up-regulation of hexokinase expression which was associated with a moderate shift to the left of the dose-response curve of glucose-induced insulin release. Third, Rabuazzoet al. (17Rabuazzo A.M. Patanè G. Anello M. Piro S. Vigneri R. Purrello F. Diabetes. 1997; 46: 1148-1452Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) showed that 3-h exposure of rat islets to 16.7 mmol/liter glucose caused both translocation of islet-associated hexokinase I protein from a cytosolic pool to the outer mitochondrial membrane and leftward shift of the concentration-dependent activation of glucose-induced insulin release. The correlation between the two events led to the suggestion that glucose-induced redistribution of hexokinase I in beta cells contributes to glucose regulation of insulin secretion (17Rabuazzo A.M. Patanè G. Anello M. Piro S. Vigneri R. Purrello F. Diabetes. 1997; 46: 1148-1452Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Fourth, in a model of conditional knockout of the rat islet glucokinase gene, Piston et al.(18Piston D.W. Knobel S.M. Postic C. Shelton K.D. Magnuson M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1000-1004Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) recently observed some residual glucose-induced shift in NAD(P)H autofluorescence in the subset of islet beta cells that recombined both GK alleles, indirectly suggesting the participation of HK in glucose metabolism of these cells. A number of observations are more difficult to reconcile with the idea that HK is important in the process of glucose recognition by beta cells. First, low K m glucose phosphorylation in islet extracts occurs much more rapidly than low K m glucose utilization in whole islets, suggesting that intracellular mediators such as glucose 6-phosphate and glucose 1,6-bisphosphate repress most islet HK allosterically (19Giroix M.H. Sener A. Pipeleers D.G. Malaisse W.J. Biochem. J. 1984; 223: 447-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Second, HK activity on the one hand and insulin release on the other could be dissociated from each other by maintaining rat islets in tissue culture, the former disappearing almost completely after 5 days of culture, whereas the latter could be well preserved (20Liang Y. Najafi H. Matschinsky F.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 16863-16866Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21Weinhaus A.J. Stout L.E. Sorenson R.L. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 1640-1649Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Third, HK is undetectably low (14Heimberg H. De Vos A. Vandercammen A. Van Schaftingen E. Pipeleers D. Schuit F. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2873-2879Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar) in the subset of the beta cells that was flow-sorted on the basis of a low glucose-induced shift in NAD(P)H autofluorescence at 7.5 mm glucose (approximately 50% of the cells, Ref. 15Kiekens R. in't Veld P. Mahler T. Schuit F. Van De Winkel M. Pipeleers D. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 89: 117-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Altogether, the concept that HK is required together with GK for normal glucose regulation is controversial and still insufficiently documented. We have therefore assessed in the present study mRNA expression of different hexokinase isoforms as well as hexokinase I protein abundance and HK enzymatic activity in FACS-purified rat pancreatic cell populations. Our results show that both acinar cells and ducts of the exocrine pancreas which are co-isolated with the islets of Langerhans and contaminate to a minor extent the FACS-purified beta cells, express hexokinase-I at very high levels. As a consequence, when this factor is not taken into account, major artifacts are introduced in the study of HK and its role in glucose regulation of beta cells. Pancreata were isolated from adult male Wistar rats (proefdiercentrum Heverlee, Belgium) which were bred according to Belgian regulations of animal welfare. Islets of Langerhans were prepared in isolation medium (123 mmol/liter NaCl, 5.4 mmol/liter KCl, 1.8 mmol/liter CaCl2, 4.2 mmol/liter NaHCO3, 0.8 mmol/liter MgSO4, 10 mmol/liter HEPES, 5.6 mmol/liter glucose, 0.01% kanamycin, and 0.25% bovine serum albumin (BSA), pH 7.4) using a modified collagenase technique which has been described (22Pipeleers D.G. in't Veld P. Van De Winkel M. Maes E. Schuit F.C. Gepts W. Endocrinology. 1985; 117: 806-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). The freshly isolated islets were dissociated into dispersed islet cells (23Pipeleers D.G. Pipeleers-Marichal M.A. Diabetologia. 1981; 20: 654-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) using dissociation medium (123 mmol/liter NaCl, 5.4 mmol/liter KCl, 4.2 mmol/liter NaHCO3, 0.8 mmol/liter MgSO4, 10 mmol/liter HEPES, 1 mmol/liter EGTA, 5.6 mmol/liter glucose, and 0.5% BSA, pH 7.4) containing trypsin (final concentration 25 μg/ml) and DNase (2 μg/ml). Islet beta cells were FACS purified from endocrine non-beta cells via autofluorescence-activated cell sorting at 2.8 mmol/liter glucose (22Pipeleers D.G. in't Veld P. Van De Winkel M. Maes E. Schuit F.C. Gepts W. Endocrinology. 1985; 117: 806-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar) on the basis of FAD/scatter using an argon laser (Spectra Physics, Mountain View, Ca) at 488 nm (excitation) and 510–550 nm (emission). In some experiments, the flow-sorted total beta cell population was further subdivided into beta cell subsets on basis of low and high NAD(P)H autofluorescence at 2.8 mmol/liter glucose (15Kiekens R. in't Veld P. Mahler T. Schuit F. Van De Winkel M. Pipeleers D. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 89: 117-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar), using a UV-laser (351–363 nm excitation/400–470 nm emission; Spectra Physics). Analysis of the cellular composition of the sorted or non-sorted islet cell preparations was performed by electron microscopy and immunocytochemistry for pancreatic hormones as described previously (22Pipeleers D.G. in't Veld P. Van De Winkel M. Maes E. Schuit F.C. Gepts W. Endocrinology. 1985; 117: 806-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). For the determination of the percentage of exocrine cells in the purified beta cell preparations, approximately 500 cells/sample were counted in the electron microscopical analysis. To assess the effect of tissue culture on HK associated with flow-sorted rat beta cells, the cells were cultured for 5 days in serum-free Ham's F-10 medium (Life Technologies, Inc., Strathclyde, United Kingdom) containing 0.075 mg/ml penicillin, 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin, 50 μmol/liter 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine, 1% (w/v) charcoal-extracted BSA (fraction V, RIA grade, Sigma), 2 mmol/liter glutamine, and 10 mmol/liter glucose (24Ling Z. Kiekens R. Mahler T. Schuit F.C. Pipeleers-Marichal M. Sener A. Klöppel G. Malaisse W.J. Pipeleers D.G. Diabetes. 1996; 45: 1774-1782Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Pancreatic acinar cells were prepared from the total collagenase digest of the pancreas and enriched by countercurrent elutriation (23Pipeleers D.G. Pipeleers-Marichal M.A. Diabetologia. 1981; 20: 654-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) using the cellular fraction with particle size below 100 μm. The elutriated cell clumps were washed by two sedimentations, resuspended in isolation medium and then cleared from debris and dead cells via sedimentation through a Percoll layer of density 1.040. After one wash in isolation medium and two washes in dissociation medium (250 g for 3 min), the cells were preincubated for 10 min at 30 °C in dissociation medium under continuous shaking. Enzymatic dissociation (23Pipeleers D.G. Pipeleers-Marichal M.A. Diabetologia. 1981; 20: 654-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) was started by addition of trypsin (final concentration 25 μg/ml) and DNase (2 μg/ml) and followed under a phase-contrast microscope. Dissociation was stopped (median required time of 30 min) when 50–60% of the cells occurred as single units. After three washes in isolation medium (250 g for 3 min) the cells were filtered through a 5-μm nylon filter to remove undigested material and finally submitted to autofluorescence-activated cell sorting at 2.8 mmol/liter glucose in order to remove dead cells and cell debris. This isolation procedure yielded a FACS-purified cell preparation with >90% acinar cells and viability exceeding 95%. Preparation of ducts from the countercurrent elutriation fraction with particle size below 100 μm was performed according to a previously published method (25Bouwens L. Braet F. Heimberg H. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1995; 43: 245-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Isolated ducts were cultured for 7 days in Ham's F-10 basal medium (Life Technologies, Inc., Gaithersburg, MD) supplemented with 6 mmol/liter glucose, 2 mmol/literl-glutamine, 1% BSA (fraction V, RIA grade, Sigma), 0.075 mg/ml penicillin (Sigma), 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin (Sigma), and 5% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum. The cell density was 15 ducts per 3 ml in a bacteriological Petri dish. Total RNA (0.5 μg) was extracted from beta cells and control tissues (brain, liver, and muscle) reverse transcribed and amplified as described before (26Heimberg H. De Vos A. Pipeleers D. Thorens B. Schuit F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8971-8975Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar) with appropriate blanks in each assay. Specific primer sequences used for PCR were as follows: hexokinase-I (5′-codon 17–23): GACCAAGTCAAAAAGATTGA, hexokinase-I (3′-codon 95–102): TCTTCTCGTGGTTCACCTGC, yielding an amplified fragment of 256 base pairs; hexokinase-II (5′-codon 18–24): 5′-CAAGTGCAGAAGGTTGACCA, hexokinase-II (3′-codon 18–24): 5′-CTCTGGAGGCCATTGTCCGT (259-base pair fragment); hexokinase-III (5′-codon 12–18): 5′GACAAAGAGACTCAAGCTGC, hexokinase-III (3′-codon 106–112): 5′-CCCGTCAGTGTTACCCACAA (300-base pair fragment); glucokinase beta cell-specific variant (see Ref. 27Magnuson M.A. Shelton K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 289: 15936-15942Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar: 5′-codon 9–15): 5′-AGGCCACCAAGAAGGAAAAG, glucokinase beta cell variant (3′-codon 97–104): 5′-TTGTCTTCACGCTCCACTGC (288-base pair fragment). As a control for the quality and quantity of the RNA, a primer mixture (equimolar concentrations) recognizing the glucose transporters GLUT1, GLUT2, and GLUT4 was used; the sequences of these primers were as described before (26Heimberg H. De Vos A. Pipeleers D. Thorens B. Schuit F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8971-8975Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar) yielding an amplified fragment of 540 base pairs. The cycling profile for each of the PCR experiments was as follows: 2.5 min at 95 °C followed by 1 min at 94 °C, 1.5 min at 65 °C, and 1.5 min at 72 °C for 10 cycles and 0.5 min at 94 °C, 1 min at 60 °C, and 1.5 min at 72 °C for 20 cycles, bringing the total number of cycles on 30. PCR products were controlled for their nucleotide sequence by fluorescent cycle sequencing on an ABI PrismTM 310 Genetic Analyzer (Perkin-Elmer Cetus, Emeryville, CA). Cell and tissue samples were washed twice in phosphate-buffered saline and homogenized by sonication in lysis buffer containing 80 mmol/liter Tris-Cl (pH 6.8), 5 mmol/liter EDTA, 5% SDS, 5% β-mercaptoethanol, and 10% glycerol in the presence of 1 mmol/liter phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Aliquots were taken for protein determination using the BCA protein assay kit (Pierce, Rockford, IL) using BSA as standard. Homogenates (20–40 μg of total cellular protein per lane) were separated on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel (Mini-Protean, Bio-Rad) and electroblotted overnight onto nitrocellulose membranes (Schleicher & Schuell, Dassel, Germany). Blotting efficiency as well as the position of the protein standards was assessed by Ponceau staining. The blots were blocked for 1 h at room temperature in 5% non-fat dry milk (pH 7.6). Hexokinase-I was detected using a monoclonal anti-hexokinase I antibody (Chemicon, Temakula, CA) at 1/1.000 dilution (16Hosakowa H. Hosakowa Y.A. Leahy J.L. Diabetes. 1995; 44: 1328-1333Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The second antibody (sheep anti-mouse peroxidase, 1/2000, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was incubated at room temperature for 50 min. Peroxidase activity was detected via chemiluminiscence (ECL, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The intensity of the signals was quantified via laser densitometry. Stripped blots were re-exposed subsequently to sheep polyclonal anti-GK antibody at 1/4000 dilution (kindly donated by Dr. H. Seitz, University of Hamburg, Germany) and goat polyclonal antibody against β-actin at 1/1000 dilution (Santa Cruz, San Diego, CA), the latter to validate quality and quantity of the loaded protein. Exposure times were 20 min for hexokinase-I, 1 min for GK, and 1 min for β-actin. Glucose phosphorylation was measured by a radiochemical assay (28Van Schaftingen E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 179: 179-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Cells or ducts (2 × 103 cells/μl (beta cells) or 5 ng of DNA/μl (acinar cells and ducts)) were homogenized via sonification in 20 mmol/liter HEPES buffer (pH 7.1) containing 50 mmol/liter KCl, 1 mmol/liter dithiothreitol, 0.5 mmol/liter EDTA, 20 μg/ml antipaine, and 20 μg/ml leupeptin. The phosphorylation assay was started by addition of 12.5 μl of cell homogenate to 12.5 μl of HEPES (40 mmol/liter) buffer (pH 7.1), containing 125 mmol/liter KCl, 1.5 mmol/liter dithiothreitol, 40 mmol/liter potassium fluoride, 0.75 mmol/liter EDTA, 10 mmol/liter Mg-ATP, 30 μg/ml antipaine, 30 μg/ml leupeptin, 0.2 mg/ml BSA, and 0.125 μCi of [U-14C]glucose in the presence of 0.5 or 20 mmol/liter glucose. Glucose 6-phosphate (Glu-6-P, final concentration = 2.5 mmol/liter) was absent or present in order to distinguish between lowK m hexokinase (Glu-6-P-sensitive) and GK which is Glu-6-P-insensitive and which exhibits a highs 0.5 value for glucose (3Matschinsky F.M. Diabetes. 1996; 45: 223-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). After 90 min incubation at 37 °C, the amount of reaction product was measured by spotting duplicates of 10 μl of the incubation medium on DE-81 paper. Non-phosphorylated glucose was removed by three washes in water followed by one wash in ethanol and a final wash in ether. Radioactivity bound to the paper was counted after mixing the dried papers with liquid scintillation mixture (OptiPhase “Hisafe” II, Wallac, Turku, Finland). FACS-purified beta cells were reaggregated for 1 h at 37 °C in Ham's F-10 medium supplemented with 2 mmol/liter l-glutamine, 1% BSA (fraction V, RIA grade), 0.075 mg/ml penicillin (Continental Pharma, Brussels, Belgium), 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin (Laboratories Diamant, Puteau, France), and 2 mmol/liter Ca2+ (basal medium) supplemented with 10 mmol/liter glucose. Insulin release and proinsulin biosynthesis were measured after 30 min preincubation in basal medium plus 1 mmol/liter glucose (control condition) or basal medium supplemented with 1 mmol/liter glucose and 50 mmol/liter 2-deoxyglucose which is converted in the cells to 2-deoxyglucose 6-phosphate to inhibit HK (29Ferber S. BeltrandelRio H. Johnson J. Noel R.J. Cassidy L.E. Clark S. Becker T.C. Hughes S. Newgard C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11523-11529Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). After washing the cells three times in basal medium, batches corresponding to 5 × 104 cells per condition were incubated for 1 h at 37 °C in 200 μl of basal medium with 0, 1, or 20 mmol/liter glucose either with or without 20 mmol/liter mannoheptulose and 50 μCi ofl-[3,5-3H]tyrosine (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), resulting in a final specific activity of 16.7 Ci/mmol and a tyrosine concentration of 15 μmol/liter, in order to measure release and biosynthesis from the same cells (24Ling Z. Kiekens R. Mahler T. Schuit F.C. Pipeleers-Marichal M. Sener A. Klöppel G. Malaisse W.J. Pipeleers D.G. Diabetes. 1996; 45: 1774-1782Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 30Schuit F.C. Kiekens R. Pipeleers D.G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 178: 1182-1187Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). DNA was measured using Hoechst 33258 (22Pipeleers D.G. in't Veld P. Van De Winkel M. Maes E. Schuit F.C. Gepts W. Endocrinology. 1985; 117: 806-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). Duct cells and acinar cells were washed in calcium-free buffer containing 150 mmol/liter NaCl, 15 mmol/liter citrate, and 3 mmol/liter EDTA (pH 7.0) and extracted for 15 min at 37 °C in 100 mmol/liter NaCl, 10 mmol/liter Tris, and 10 mmol/liter EDTA (pH 7.0). The fluorimetric assay at 355 nm (excitation)/455 nm (emission) was carried out after addition of Hoechst 33258 solution (100 ng/ml) to the samples. Data are expressed as mean ± S.E. of n independent experiments. Unless stated otherwise, the significance of differences between conditions was tested by unpaired two-tailed Student's t test. We first assessed the abundance of various hexokinase transcripts in FACS-purified beta cells, using isoform-specific primer sets and taking total RNA extracted from rat brain, liver, and muscle as positive and negative controls. The amplification reaction utilizing the GK-primer set from which the 5′-primer is directed against beta cell-specific codons 9–15 of GK-mRNA, resulted in the expected (27Magnuson M.A. Shelton K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 289: 15936-15942Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar, 31Heimberg H. De Vos A. Moens K. Quartier E. Bouwens L. Pipeleers D. Van Schaftingen E. Madsen O. Schuit F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 7036-7041Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar) 288-base pair fragment when RNA was used from flow-sorted rat beta cells (Fig.1). Moreover, the same primers gave negative results starting from rat liver RNA (Fig. 1). RNA extracted from FACS-purified rat beta cell preparations appeared also positive for hexokinase-I messenger, since with hexokinase-I-specific primers a PCR product of the same length and nucleotide sequence could be amplified as when the reaction was performed with rat brain RNA. On the contrary, amplification of hexokinase-II or -III cDNA fragments was negative when starting from rat beta cell RNA, while rat muscle and liver, respectively, gave positive results. To determine whether the hexokinase-I mRNA that was detected in flow-sorted rat beta cells is translated, we performed immunoblots starting from total protein from collagenase-isolated rat islets as well as from purified beta cells and exocrine acinar cells (Fig. 2). In freshly purified beta cells, the hexokinase-I abundance appeared low, at least 10-fold less abundant than in freshly isolated islets of Langerhans: the OD ratios normalized for β-actin were 0.4 (islets) and 0.02 (beta cells). The cellular origin of the detected hexokinase-I protein in whole islets is suggested by high hexokinase-I expression in exocrine pancreatic cells (virtually as abundant as in rat brain). In contrast to the large difference in hexokinase-I expression in whole islets and purified beta cells, GK abundance in isolated islets and FACS-purified beta cells were comparable, the observed OD ratio of GK over β-actin being 0.45 and 0.65 in islets and in beta cells, respectively. To assess the functional integrity of HK and GK protein, we measured glucose phosphorylation in FACS-purified beta and alpha cells as well as in purified pancreatic acinar and ductal cells (TableI).

Human carbonic anhydrase II is a suitable model protein for studying the mechanism of aggregation. We found that a molten globule state of the enzyme formed aggregates. The intermolecular interactions involved in aggregate formation were localized in a direct way by measuring excimer formation between each of 20 site-specific pyrene-labeled cysteine mutants. The contact area of the aggregated protein was very specific, and all sites included in the intermolecular interactions were located in the large β-sheet of the protein, within a limited region between the central β-strands 4 and 7. This substructure is very hydrophobic, which underlines the importance of hydrophobic interactions between specific β-sheet containing regions in aggregate formation.

Moreover, protein aggregation is known to be involved in several disorders, such as Alzheimer's disease, cystic fibrosis, and prion diseases. Aggregation-induced formation of inclusion bodies is often a major obstacle in large scale production of heterologous proteins, which is a drawback in biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries and in biomedical research (1Betts S.

To be able to develop a rational strategy for design of novel drugs that intervene in aggregation and to control aggregation in various situations, it is necessary to understand the mechanism underlying aggregation. Transient formation of aggregates is also a potential problem in studies of refolding kinetics, because aggregates can easily be mistaken for on-pathway folding intermediates (3Silow M. Oliveberg M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6084-6086Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar).Protein aggregation has long been regarded as a nonspecific process. However, recent observations suggest that it is more likely that aggregation is due to specific interactions of partially folded intermediates (1Betts S. Haase-Pettingell C. King J. Adv.

So far, the most detailed information available on the structural nature of these aggregates have been obtained by using indirect methods, such as mutagenesis experiments (1Betts S. Haase-Pettingell C. King J. Adv. Protein Chem. 1997; 50: 243-264Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, it is essential that a detailed mapping of the intermolecular interactions involved can be investigated using complementary methods that directly monitor the interaction in the interface of aggregated proteins.Human carbonic anhydrase II (HCA II)1 (Fig.1) has a molecular mass of 29.3 kDa and consists of 259 amino acid residues (8Henderson L.E.

To elucidate the function of the cytoplasmic, NH2 terminus of rat ENaC (rENaC) subunits, a series of mutant cDNAs was constructed and the cRNAs for all three subunits were expressed in Xenopusoocytes. Amiloride-sensitive Na+ currents (INa) were measured by the two-electrode voltage clamp technique. Deletion of the cytoplasmic, NH2 terminus of α (Δ2–109), β (Δ2–49), or γ-rENaC (Δ2–53) dramatically reduced INa. A series of progressive, NH2-terminal deletions of α-rENaC were constructed to identify motifs that regulate INa. Deletion of amino acids 2–46 had no effect on INa: however, deletion of amino acids 2–51, 2–55, 2–58, and 2–67 increased INa by ∼4-fold. By contrast, deletion of amino acids 2–79, 2–89, 2–100, and 2–109 eliminated INa. To evaluate the mechanism whereby Δ2–67-α-rENaC increased INa, single channels were evaluated by patch clamp. The single-channel conductance and open probability of α,β,γ-rENaC and Δ2–67-α,β,γ-rENaC were similar. However, the number of active channels in the membrane increased from 6 ± 1 channels per patch with α,β,γ-rENaC to 11 ± 1 channels per patch with Δ2–67-α,β,γ-rENaC. Laser scanning confocal microscopy confirmed that there were more Δ2–67-α,β,γ-rENaC channels in the plasma membrane than α,β,γ-rENaC channels. Deletion of amino acids 2–67 in α-rENaC reduced the endocytic retrieval of channels from the plasma membrane and increased the half-life of the channel in the membrane from 1.1 ± 0.2 to 3.5 ± 1.1 h. We conclude that the cytoplasmic, NH2 terminus of α-, β-, and γ-rENaC is required for channel activity. The cytoplasmic, NH2 terminus of α-rENaC contains two key motifs.

For example, in Liddle's syndrome mutations and/or deletions of the NPXY motif in β- or γ-ENaC reduces subunit ubiquitination and endocytic retrieval of ENaC from the plasma membrane. This results in an increase in the number of channels in the membrane, which causes hyperabsorption of Na+ and hypertension (12Schild L. Lu Y. Gautschi I. Schneeberger E. Lifton R.P. Rossier B.C.

Although recent studies suggest that the NH2 terminus may play a role in channel assembly and gating (16Adams C.M. Snyder P.M. Welsh M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27295-27300Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 17Grunder S. Firsov D. Chang S.S. Fowler Jager N. Gautschi I. Schild L. Lifton R.P. Rossier B.C.

J. 1998; 336: 705-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), a complete understanding of the function of the NH2 terminus of any ENaC subunit is not available. Thus, the goal of this study was to test the hypothesis that the NH2 termini of ENaC's are critical for channel activity. To elucidate the function of the cytoplasmic, NH2 terminus of each rENaC subunit, a series of mutant cDNAs was constructed and the cRNAs were expressed in Xenopus oocytes. Amiloride-sensitive Na+ currents (INa) were measured by the two-electrode voltage-clamp technique. We report that the cytoplasmic, NH2 terminus of α-, β-, and γ-rENaC is required for channel activity. Our data demonstrate that the NH2 terminus of α-rENaC contains two key regions: one that regulates the half-life of the channel in the plasma membrane. Deletion of this motif increases INa by reducing the rate of channel endocytosis. The second region is required for normal channel activity. Deletion of this region eliminates INa. Plasmids containing cDNAs encoding the wt α-, β-, and γ-subunits of rENaC, cloned into the pSport vector, were a generous gift of Dr. Bernard C. Rossier, Lausanne, Switzerland (5Canessa C.M. Schild L. Buell G. Thorens B. Gautschi I. Horisberger J.-D. Rossier B.C. Nature. 1994; 367: 463-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (1774) Google Scholar, 19Canessa C.M. Horisberger J. Rossier B.D. Nature. 1993; 361: 467-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (827) Google Scholar). Deletions of the cytoplasmic, NH2termini of α-, β-, and γ-rENaC were made by PCR-based mutagenesis. Because all deletions were generated using a similar approach, details will be given for only one construct. The sequence of all PCR products and cDNAs with deletions was confirmed by dye terminator cycle sequencing (ABI PRISM: PE Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). pSport/Δ2–41-α-rENaC, encoding a protein in which the NH2-terminal 41 amino acids of α-rENaC were deleted, was constructed in two steps. First, a 476-bp PCR fragment was synthesized using pSport/α-rENaC cDNA as a template, with a sense primer (CGACGTCGACCATGCAAGGACTGGGGAAGGGGGAC-3′) corresponding to nucleotides 127–147 of α-rENaC and an antisense primer (CTGGCGAGTGTAGGAAGAGTTGTA) corresponding to nucleotides 565–588. The sense primer also contained an upstream SalI restriction site, a partial Kozak consensus sequence, and an initiator methionine codon. The antisense primer was located downstream of a unique BsrGI restriction site. The 476-bp PCR product was isolated, purified (Wizard, Promega, Madison, WI), subcloned into pcR 2.1 (TA Cloning Kit, Invitrogen), and sequenced. In the second step, pSport/α-rENaC and pcR 2.1 containing the 476-bp PCR product were digested with SalI/BsrGI, and the gel-purified 440-bp PCR fragment was ligated into digested pSport/α-rENaC. To monitor the expression of rENaC in the plasma membrane the 5′ end of β-rENaC and γ-rENaC cDNA were ligated in-frame to the 3′ end of the cDNA encoding the enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP-C1 and EGFP-C2: CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA). GFP-β-rENaC was constructed in two steps. First, β-rENaC was excised from pSport/β-rENaC with SalI/KpnI, and the excised fragment was ligated into SalI/KpnI digested pEGFP-C1 to construct pEGFP-C1-β-rENaC (i.e.GFP-β-rENaC). To remove two pre-existing stop codons between theSalI site and an initiator methionine in pEGFP-C1-β-rENaC a 563-bp PCR fragment was synthesized using β-rENaC cDNA as a template with a sense primer (ACGCGTCGACGGTGCCACCATGCCAGTGAAGAAGTACCT) corresponding to nucleotides 1–20 of β-rENaC and an antisense primer (GGTGCTTCCTGGGGCTGGGTTGCTGCTGTT) corresponding to nucleotides 514–543 of β-rENaC. The sense primer also contained an upstreamSalI restriction site and a Kozak consensus site sequence. The PCR product contained a unique BsmBI restriction site just upstream of the anitsense primer sequence. The 563-bp PCR product was isolated, purified (Wizard, Promega), and subcloned into pcR 2.1 (TA Cloning Kit, Invitrogen) for sequencing. In the second step, pEGFP-C1-β-rENaC and pcR 2.1 containing the 563-bp PCR product were digested with SalI/BsmBI and the gel-purified 316-bp PCR fragment was ligated into digested pEGFP-C1-β-rENaC. Subsequently, GFP-β-rENaC was subcloned from pEGFP-C1-β-rENaC into pcDNA3.1− (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) usingNheI/KpnI. GFP-γ-rENaC was constructed by excising γ-rENaC from pSport/γ-rENaC with SalI/KpnI, and ligating the excised fragment into SalI/KpnI digested pEGFP-C2. GFP-γ-rENaC was subcloned from pEGFP-C2-γ-rENaC into pcDNA3.1− using NheI. pcDNA3.1− was digested with NheI and calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase-treated to prevent self-ligation (to generate pcDNA3.1−/EGFP/γ-rENaC). pSport vectors were linearized withNotI and pcDNA3.1− vectors were linearized with AfflI. The linearized cDNAs were used as a template for cRNA synthesis using a kit containing T7 RNA polymerase, ribonucleotides, and a 7-methylguanosine cap analog following the manufacturer's instructions (mMessage mMachine, Ambion Inc., Austin TX). Oocytes were isolated and injected with cRNA as described previously (20Dascal N. CRC Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1987; 22: 317-387Crossref Scopus (518) Google Scholar, 21Chalfant M.L. Denton J.S.

Briefly, ovarian lobes were removed from Xenopus laevis and stored in calcium-free OR-2 solution. Oocytes were isolated and defolliculated using a combination of enzymatic treatment and manual dissection. Defolliculated Stage V and VI oocytes were transferred to L-15 medium modified for use with amphibian cells and supplemented with gentamycin sulfate. cRNA transcribed from wt or truncated α-, β-, and γ-rENaC cDNAs was injected into oocytes as described under “Results.” As described in detail elsewhere (21Chalfant M.L.

Cell Physiol. 1999; 276: C477-C486Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the amiloride-sensitive current (INa) was measured in oocytes 1–3 days after injection of cRNA using the two-microelectrode voltage-clamp technique in oocytes bathed in a solution containing (in mm): NaCl, 110; KCl, 2; CaCl2, 0.4; MgCl2, 1.0; HEPES, 5, pH 7.4 (21Chalfant M.L. Denton J.S. Berdiev B.K. Ismailov I.I. Benos D.J. Stanton B.A. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 1999; 276: C477-C486Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). All experiments were performed at 22–24 °C. Unless otherwise noted oocytes were co-injected with equal amounts of α-, β-, and γ-rENaC cRNA (2.5 ng/subunit). INa was measured as the difference in the whole cell current at −100 mV before and after amiloride (100 μm), a concentration sufficient to completely inhibit rENaC currents (22McNicholas C.M. Canessa C.M. J. Gen. Physiol. 1997; 109: 681-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Single channel currents were measured in the cell-attached mode using the patch-clamp technique in de-vitellated oocytes as described in detail (21Chalfant M.L. Denton J.S. Berdiev B.K. Ismailov I.I.

Pflugers Arch. 1986; 407: 577-588Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar). Currents were amplified, filtered with a low-pass, 4-pole Bessel filter with a cutoff frequency of 200 Hz, digitized at a sampling rate of 2 kHz, and stored on the hard disc of a DOS-based computer for subsequent analysis using pCLAMP software version 6.03. Single-channel currents were measured at voltages from −40 to −100 mV (21Chalfant M.L. Denton J.S. Berdiev B.K. Ismailov I.I. Benos D.J. Stanton B.A. Am. J. Physiol.

P o, the single channel open probability, and n, the number of active channels in the membrane, were calculated as described in detail (24Light D.B. McCann F.V. Keller T.M. Stanton B.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1988; 255: F278-F286Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To examine the effect of NH2-terminal truncations of α-rENaC on the expression of rENaC in the plasma membrane, stage V or VI oocytes were injected with cRNAs coding for wt, Δ2–67-α-rENaC, or Δ2–109-α-rENa (4 ng/subunit) in combination with GFP-β-rENaC (4 ng/subunit) and GFP-γ-rENaC (4 ng/subunit). Four groups of oocytes (10 oocytes/group) were studied: 1) wt-α-rENaC + GFP-β-rENaC + GFP-γ-rENaC; 2) Δ2–67-α-rENaC + GFP-β-rENaC + GFP-γ-rENaC; 3) Δ2–109-α-rENaC + GFP-β-rENaC + GFP-γ-rENaC, and 4) water. 48 h after cRNA injection the cellular localization of GFP-tagged rENaC was determined by laser scanning confocal microscopy as described in detail previously (25Awayda M.S. Tousson A. Benos D.J. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 1997; 273: C1889-C1899Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Proteins in the plasma membrane were biotinylated using EZ-Link Sulfo-NHS-LC-Biotin (Pierce, Rockford, IL). Subsequent to biotinylation, oocytes were washed in ND-48 and the biotin was labeled at 4 °C with stepavidin conjugated to Texas Red (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). Confocal images were acquired using an Olympus Flouview BX50 upright microscope equipped with an air-cooled krypton/argon laser scanning head and viewed with a UplanF1 × 10X/0.3 NA air objective. GFP fluorescence was excited using the 488-nm laser line and collected using a standard fluorescein isothiocyanate filter set (530 ± 30 nm). Texas red fluorescence was excited using the 568-nm laser line and collected using a standard Texas Red filter set (605 ± 32 nm). XY scans were obtained at 12-bit resolution at approximately the midpoint of each oocyte. All images were acquired, processed (Adobe Photoshop 5.0), and printed using the same settings in each of the three groups of oocytes. Differences between means were compared by ANOVA and the Bonferroni post hoc comparison test, or the paired or unpaired Student's t test, as appropriate. Statistical analyses were performed with the InStat statistical software package (Graphpad, San Diego, CA). Data were expressed as the mean ± S.E. p < 0.05 was considered significant. As illustrated in Fig. 1, expression of α-rENaC in Xenopus oocytes, produced a small amiloride-sensitive INa. Co-expression of α-rENaC with β-rENaC or γ-rENaC elicited larger currents compared with α-rENaC alone. Maximum currents were expressed when oocytes expressed all three rENaC subunits. In the absence of α-rENaC, β-rENaC and γ-rENaC did not produce a current in oocytes (data not shown). These data confirm earlier studies (5Canessa C.M. Schild L. Buell G. Thorens B. Gautschi I. Horisberger J.-D. Rossier B.C. Nature. 1994; 367: 463-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (1774) Google Scholar, 22McNicholas C.M. Canessa C.M. J. Gen. Physiol. 1997; 109: 681-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). The cytoplasmic, amino (NH2) termini of α-rENaC (amino acids 1–109), β-rENaC (amino acids 1–49), and γ-rENaC (amino acids 1–53) have regions of highly conserved sequences among species. This suggests that the NH2 terminus of all three subunits may subserve important functional roles. To test this hypothesis we deleted the NH2-terminal, cytoplasmic domain (ΔN) of each rENaC subunit and examined the effect of the truncation on INa. In oocytes expressing wt-α-rENaC, wt-β-rENaC, and wt-γ-rENaC, the INa was 4.0 ± 0.7 μA (Fig.2). Truncation of the NH2terminus of α-, β-, or γ-rENaC dramatically reduced INa (Fig. 2). For example, in oocytes expressing ΔNα-rENaC with wt-β-rENaC and wt-γ-rENaC we could not detect an amiloride-sensitive current (Fig. 2). Similarly, in oocytes expressing wt-α-rENaC with ΔNβ-rENaC and ΔNγ-rENaC no amiloride-sensitive current could be detected (Fig. 2). Co-expression of wt-α-rENaC with ΔNβ-rENaC and wt-γ-rENaC dramatically and significantly reduced INa compared with oocytes expressing α-, β-, and γ-rENaC (p < 0.001). Finally, co-expression of wt-α-rENaC with wt-β-rENaC and ΔNγ-rENaC also dramatically and significantly reduced INa compared with oocytes expressing α-, β-, and γ-rENaC (p < 0.001). These data demonstrate that the NH2 termini of α-, β-, and γ-rENaC are required to produce maximum INa in oocytes. To determine if truncation of the NH2 terminus of each rENaC subunit eliminated the contribution of that subunit to a functional channel or if the mutant subunit interacted with the wild type subunits, in a negative way, we examined the effect of co-expressing NH2-terminal truncated subunits with only one or two wild type subunits. In oocytes co-expressing wt-α-rENaC and wt-γ-rENaC, INa was 222 ± 25 nA (Fig. 3). Co-expression of ΔNβ-rENaC with wt-α-rENaC and wt-γ-rENaC significantly reduced INa to 135 ± 24 nA (p < 0.02: Fig. 3). By contrast, coexpression of wt-β-rENaC with wt-α-rENaC and wt-γ-rENaC dramatically and significantly increased INa (Fig. 1). Thus, ΔNβ-rENaC interacts negatively with wt-α-rENaC and wt-γ-rENaC. In oocytes expressing wt-α-rENaC and wt-β-rENaC INa was 84 ± 18 nA (Fig. 3). Co-expression of ΔNγ-rENa with wt-α-rENaC and wt-β-rENaC did not significantly alter INa (Fig. 3). Thus, ΔNγ-rENaC did not functionally interact with wt-α-rENaC and wt-β-rENaC. By contrast, coexpression of wt-γ-rENaC with wt-α-rENaC and wt-β-rENaC dramatically increased INa (Fig. 1). Finally, in oocytes expressing wt-α-rENaC alone INa was 19 ± 2 nA (Fig. 3). Co-expression of ΔNβ-rENaC and ΔNγ-rENaC with wt-α-rENaC reduced INa to 5 ± 2 nA (Fig. 3). By contrast, co-expression of wt-β-rENaC and wt-γ-rENaC and wt-α-rENaC dramatically increased INa (Fig. 1). Thus, ΔNβ-rENaC and ΔNγ-rENaC interact negatively with wt-α-rENaC. Recently it was demonstrated that α,β,γ-rENaC channels and α,γ-rENaC channels are more permeable to Li+ than to Na+, whereas α,β-rENaC channels are more permeable to Na+ than to Li+ (22McNicholas C.M. Canessa C.M. J. Gen. Physiol. 1997; 109: 681-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). To determine if co-expression of ΔN-rENaC with wt-ENaC subunits not only reduced INa but also affected cationic permeability, the relative permeability of rENaC channels to Li+ versusNa+ (ILi/INa) was determined by calculating the ratio of amiloride-sensitive current in a Li+-containing bath solution (100 mm LiCl) to the amiloride-sensitive current in a Na+-containing bath solution (100 mm NaCl). In oocytes expressing α-, β-, and ΔNγ-rENaC, the ILi/INa was 0.81 ± 0.06, indistinguishable from that observed with α,β-rENaC (0.79 ± 0.04; p > 0.5). These observations are consistent with the conclusion that whereas γ-rENaC affects cation permeability, ΔNγ-rENaC does not. In oocytes expressing α-, ΔNβ-, and γ-rENaC the ILi/INa was 1.15 ± 0.06, indistinguishable from that observed with α,γ-rENaC (1.15 ± 0.05; p > 0.9). Thus, although truncation of the NH2 terminus of β-rENaC decreased INa when co-expressed with α- and γ-rENaC, this truncation did not affect the permeability of the channel to Li+ over Na+. Taken together these observations are consistent with the conclusion that ΔNβ-rENaC combines with the α- and γ-subunit channel complex. The data presented in Fig. 3 demonstrate that deletion of the cytoplasmic, NH2 terminus of β and perhaps γ-rENaC produced a subunit that reduced INa. Moreover, studies on other multimeric ion channels have shown that the interaction of nonfunctional channel subunits with functional ones disrupts channel function and/or expression in the plasma membrane (26Tucker S.J.

Neuron. 1993; 11: 67-76Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). In addition, overexpression of the cytoplasmic NH2 terminus of degenerins, which are closely related to ENaC, inhibits channel activity (16Adams C.M. Snyder P.M. Welsh M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27295-27300Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Thus, to determine if overexpression of wt or ΔN subunits of rENaC affects INa, oocytes were injected with equal amounts of cRNA for the α-, β-, and γ-subunits (2.5 ng/subunit/oocyte) plus a 10-fold excess (25 ng/subunit/oocyte) of either a wild-type subunit or a corresponding NH2-terminal truncated mutant (Fig.4). Overexpression of either wt- or ΔN-rENaC subunits had a significant effect on INa (Fig.4). A 10 times excess of wt-α-rENaC significantly reduced INa (Fig. 4). By contrast, a 10 times excess of wt-β-rENaC significantly increased INa (Fig. 4). However, a 10 times excess of wt-γ-rENaC had no effect on INa. On the other hand, 10-fold overexpression of NH2-terminal truncated α-, β-, or γ-rENaC individually with wt partners completely eliminated INa (Fig. 4). These observations are consistent with the conclusion that deletion of the NH2terminus of α-, β-, and γ-rENaC produced a dominant negative mutant. In addition, the observation that an excess of wt-α-rENaC decreased INa whereas an excess of wt-γ-rENaC increased INa suggests that the level of expression of the α- and γ-subunit regulates INa. To begin to identify the key amino acids in the NH2 terminus of α-rENaC that are important for channel function, we made a series of NH2-terminal, truncated α-rENaC cDNAs and co-expressed truncated α-rENaCs with wild type β- and γ-rENaC. Deletion of amino acids 2–41 and 2–46 had no effect on INa (Fig.5). However, deletion of amino acids 2–51 increased INa by almost 4-fold (Fig. 5). Thus, deletion of amino acids 47 through 50 had a dramatic and positive effect on INa. Deletion of amino"

KSα contains the essential amino acid residues involved in catalytic condensation of the co-acylated derivative of the extender units, whereas the KSβ partner (which is highly similar but non-identical to KSα) is thought to influence the number of iterations of the condensation cycle and hence the length of the polyketide chain, justifying its original designation as the chain length factor (8McDaniel R. Ebert-Khosla S. Hopwood D.A. Khosla C. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1993; 115: 11671-11675Crossref Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Matrix experiments, in which the KS and acyl carrier protein elements have been exchanged among different PKSs, have reinforced this view. When expressed alone in Streptomyces coelicolor using the elegant trancriptionally activated pRM5/CH999 system, the two KS subunits and acyl carrier protein from the otc gene cluster directed the biosynthesis of an incorrectly cyclized 20-carbon backbone, without the terminal carboxamido group that is typical of oxytetracycline (9Fu H. Ebert-Khosla S. Hopwood D.A. Khosla C. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1994; 116: 6443-6444Crossref Scopus (51) Google Scholar). This implied that the minimal PKS for OTC biosynthesis could not direct synthesis of the natural 19-carbon backbone on its own. After the nascent polyketide chain has been formed, it must be folded and cyclized to take up its final structure. Two different types of gene products have been associated with this process: “ketoreductases” (KR), which are responsible for reduction of one of the keto groups within the chain; and “cyclases” (CYC), which are responsible for carbon-carbon bond formation resulting in the closed rings of the final products (6Hopwood D.A. Khosla C. Chadwick D.J. Whelan J. Secondary Metabolites: Their Function and Evolution. 171. Ciba Foundation Symposium, John Wiley and Sons, Chichester, UK1992: 88-112Google Scholar). A KR step is not obligatory for formation of some polyketides, e.g. the unreduced polyketide, tetracemonycin, folds and is cyclized without a KR (10Hutchinson C.R. Fujii I. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1995; 49: 201-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). However, cyclases are ubiquitous in polyketide gene clusters. They fall into two classes: (a) those with “didomain” architecture (typified by frenolicin; see Ref. 11Bibb M.J. Sherman D.H. Omura S. Hopwood D.A. Gene. 1994; 142: 31-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) in which the N-terminal segment of the gene has likely been duplicated to form the C-terminal second domain, and (b) those with “monodomain” architecture (typified by whiE- ORFVI; see Ref. 12Davis N.K. Chater K.F. Mol. Microbiol. 1990; 4: 1679-1691Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar) containing a single cyclase domain. In some instances a single cyclase domain may be linked to a second domain of unrelated function e.g. tcmN, which has an O-methyltransferase activity at its C terminus (13Summers R.G. Wendt-Pienkowski E. Motamedi H. Hutchinson C.R. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 1810-1820Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Some polyketide structures may require more than one cyclase to fold them correctly (14Hopwood D.A. Chem. Rev. 1997; 97: 2465-2497Crossref PubMed Scopus (623) Google Scholar). Similarity among DNA sequences of different Type II PKSs has been used to identify (e.g. see Ref. 15Malpartida F.M. Hallam S.E. Kieser H.M. Motamedi H. Hutchinson C.R. Butler M.J. Sugden D.A. Warren M. McKillop C. Bailey C.R. Humphreys G.O. Hopwood D.A. Nature. 1987; 325: 818-821Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar) and clone homologous sequences from other streptomycete species. Biosynthesis of actinorhodin has become the paradigm for study of Type II PKSs. The genes responsible for the assembly of the backbone of actinorhodin are contiguous on the chromosome of S. coelicolor, an architecture that is present in most other homologous gene clusters. When actI (the minimal PKS) and actIII (KR) of the actinorhodin cluster were used as probes with the clonedotc cluster, two non-contiguous regions of homology were identified (16Butler M.J. Binnie C. Hunter I.S. Sugden D.A. Warren M. Dev. Ind. Microbiol. 1990; 31: 41-50Google Scholar): otcY1 hybridized with actI (and DNA sequencing has shown it to constitute the otc minimal PKS (17Kim E.S. Bibb M.J. Butler M.J. Hopwood D.A. Sherman D.H. Gene. 1994; 141: 141-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar)), whereas otcY2 lay 10 kb away and hybridized toactIII. This paper is concerned with the analysis of the DNA adjacent to the otcY2 locus. It describes the characterization of a bifunctional cyclase gene, otcD1, its subsequent manipulation to produce a recombinant blocked in that function, and characterization of the polyketide metabolites made by the recombinant. S. rimosus R6 is used for the commercial production of OTC. It was maintained and grown in fermentation medium as described previously (18Hranueli D. Pigac J. Vešligaj M. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1979; 114: 295-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The methods used were described by Sambrook et al. (19Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) for Escherichia coli and by Hopwood et al. (20Hopwood D.A. Bibb M.J.

Microbiol. 1995; 61: 352-356Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). DNA was sequenced by the Sanger method (22Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52649) Google Scholar). Templates were prepared by subcloning the DNA into vectors that contained universal and reverse primer binding sites. If necessary, the region of sequence determination was extended with custom primers. 1.5 liters of fermentation medium was saturated with NaH2PO4 and extracted with ethyl acetate (3 × 1 liter). After evaporation to dryness, the extract was applied to a silica gel flash chromatography column and eluted with chloroform containing increasing amounts of methanol. Fractions containing the desired compounds were purified further on a Sephadex LH-20 column and eluted in a chloroform/methanol gradient. This was undertaken primarily by NMR (400 MHz) using, in addition to standard one-dimensional experiments, the two-dimensional homonuclear correlated spectroscopy-45 technique for direct 1H-1H coupling (23Williams D.H. Fleming I. Methods in Organic Chemistry. 5th Ed. McGraw-Hill Publishing Co., London, UK1997Google Scholar), the hydrogen-carbon correlation with a bilinear rotation decoupling pulse technique for 1-bond (1 J) heteronuclear (1H-13C interactions) (24Sanders J.K.M. Hunter B.K. Modern NMR Spectrospcopy: A Guide for Chemists. Oxford University Press, Oxford, UK1987Google Scholar), and the HMBC4 pulse sequence for 2-bond (2 J) and 3-bond (3 J) interactions (23Williams D.H. Fleming I. Methods in Organic Chemistry. 5th Ed. McGraw-Hill Publishing Co., London, UK1997Google Scholar). When the entire otc cluster was digested with various restriction enzymes and subjected to Southern blots usingactIII (KR; Ref. 25Hallam S.E. Malpartida F. Hopwood D.A. Gene. 1988; 74: 305-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar) as a probe, a SacI fragment of approximately 700 base pairs gave the strongest signal (HB in Fig.2;Sac 29–Sac 31 in the restriction map of the otc cluster described in Ref. 26Hunter I.S. Hill R.A. Strohl W.R. Bio/Technology of Antibiotics. 2nd Ed. Marcel Decker, Inc., New York1997: 659-682Google Scholar), indicating that it likely contained the major part of the gene encoding the functional equivalent the KR for OTC biosynthesis. Analysis of this DNA sequence and the segment adjacent (Sac 31 toSph 28) revealed two open reading frames: the incomplete C terminus of the ActIII homologue, OtcY2-ORF2, and the complete open reading frame of otcD1 (Fig. 2). The DNA sequence of otcD1 and its flanks has been deposited at GenBankTM. The deduced polypeptide, OtcD1, was predicted to contain 317 amino acids with M r of 34635. Using the TBLASTN software (27Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schaffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (59865) Google Scholar), OtcD1 showed substantial end-to-end similarity with other deduced cyclases from polyketide biosynthetic clusters. The N- and C-terminal halves of OtcD1 have reasonable similarity to each other (Fig. 3) indicating a didomain architecture, and aromatase/cyclase (ARO/CYC) function. The restriction site Sac 29 lies within the open reading frame of otcD1 (Fig. 2).ErmE, encoding erythromycin resistance (28Bibb M.J. Janssen G.R. Ward J.M. Gene. 1985; 38: 215-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar), was subcloned into the Sac 29 site of an E. coliplasmid-based copy of the gene and this disrupted copy ofotcD1 (otcD1::ermE) was homogenotized into the chromosome of S. rimosus, using an unstable bifunctional construct, pGLW121, based on the thiostrepton-resistant streptomycete vector pIJ487 (29Ward J.M. Janssen G.R. Kieser T. Bibb M.J. Buttner M.J. Bibb M.J. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1986; 203: 468-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). Transformation of pGLW121 into S. rimosus R6 was selected by resistance to thiostrepton and erythromycin. After two subcultures under non-selective conditions, transformants were screened to identify isolates (erythromycin-resistant, thiostrepton-sensitive) that had the disrupted copy of otcD1 introduced into the chromosome by a double crossover and lost the vector sequences from the cell. The genotypes of such isolates were confirmed by Southern blotting (30Southern E.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1975; 98: 503-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (21468) Google Scholar), and strain ZGL3 was chosen for further work. Three compounds were separated from the Sephadex column with 6% (v/v) methanol in chloroform, LH-1 (15.2 mg), followed by LH-2 (8.5 mg), and finally LH-3 (6.7 mg). A further compound, LH-4 (7.3 mg), was obtained by direct flash chromatography of the fermentation broth by elution with 8% (v/v) methanol in chloroform. LH-1 failed to yield a molecular ion by electron impact mass spectroscopy but the 13C NMR spectrum clearly resolved the presence of 9 carbons: two sp 3 (both methylenes) and seven sp 2 (two methines and five quaternary). The 1H NMR spectrum confirmed the presence of two methylenes and two olefinic methines and in addition revealed broad resonances for OH and NH2. The NMR chemical shift data are listed in Table I. The IR spectrum revealed a number of absorption bands between 1,716 and 1,639 cm−1, which suggested a polyketide.Table INMR chemical shift data for LH-1 and comparison with published data for SEK4 (33Fu H.

The two olefinic protons exhibitedmeta-coupling to each other with one (δ 5.26; δc 89.0) in an unusually electrophilic environment reminiscent of H-3 in a 2,4-oxygenated pyran as found in SEK4 (Fig.4, reported in Ref. 33Fu H.

This was confirmed by the HMBC experiment, the correlations observed being shown in Fig. 5 and which allowed LH-1 (Fig. 4) to be identified as 6-(4-amino-2,4-butadionyl)-4-hydroxypyran-2-one (Fig.6). 2The numbering system used in the figures and tables in this paper is non-IUPAC but follows that of Fu et al.

We support this revision as the C-4 resonance at δc 170.2 is at variance with that found in the pyran-4-one system of flavones and would be anticipated at ∼δc 176.0 (32Agarwal P.K.

The 1H NMR revealed resonances for amide protons (δ 6.73, 7.09) and hydroxyl protons (δ 7.13, 10.40, 11.50). The presence of the 6-substituted 4-hydroxypyran-2-one moeity was identified by comparison with LH-1. The 6-substituent was established as a methylene (δ 3.07, 2.99; δc 44.0) by observation in an HMBC experiment (Fig.5 b) of the long range coupling of the methylene protons to C-6 and C-5 of the pyran ring. Likewise, further resonances were compatible with the presence of the methylenecarboxamide starter group of this compound.Table II1 H NMR and 13 C NMR chemical shift data for compounds LH-2, LH-3, and LH-4H/CδHδCLH-2LH-3LH-4LH-2LH-3LH-41162.7163.9162.525.27 d (2.4)5.16 d (2.1)4.65 s89.188.286.83(OH)11.50 s11.40 s5.35 s170.1170.6163.02-aValues in the same column are interchangeable.46.11 d (2.4)5.55 d (2.1)4.04 d (15.9)103.299.637.45160.62-aValues in the same column are interchangeable.165.7139.763.07 d (14.4)4.36 s6.29 d (2.1)44.037.4113.02.99 d (14.4)7(OH)7.13 s7.49 s100.2137.8162.82-aValues in the same column are interchangeable.82.97 d (16.0)6.74 d (2.3)6.18 d (2.1)47.4117.8102.72.55 d (16.0)9(OH)10.86 s190.3161.42-aValues in the same column are interchangeable.161.3106.76 d (2.3)111.8102.2111.711160.82-aValues in the same column are interchangeable.159.32-aValues in the same column are interchangeable.190.6126.21 d (2.4)3.15 d (16.0)102.2113.848.013(OH)10.40 s163.7177.7100.6146.31 d (2.4)6.07 s2.66 d (14.5)113.4112.343.815140.0162.1171.3163.82 d (15.2)3.47 s41.040.33.70 d (15.2)17171.8168.4NH26.73 s7.17 s7.20 s7.09 s7.63 s7.61 sAll spectra were run in Me2SO · d6.2-a Values in the same column are interchangeable. Open table in a new tab All spectra were run in Me2SO · d6. The intervening structure was established by further analysis of the HMBC experiment (Fig. 5 b). Thus, the methylene of the methylenecarboxamide was coupled with two meta-coupled protons of an aromatic ring, one of which (δ 6.21, δc103.2) must be placed between the two oxygens. From the 6-methylene substituent of the pyran-4-one substituent there was a coupling with a carbon resonating at 100.2 ppm. This quaternary carbon was also correlated with the protons of another methylene and with the proton of the hydroxyl resonating at δ 7.13, and it was concluded that it must be an sp 3 carbon carrying two oxygen substituents. This additional methylene revealed further couplings to a carbonyl at δc 190.3, which is indicative of a flavanone-like dihydropyran system (31Yu T.W. Shen Y. McDaniel R. Floss H.G. Khosla C. Hopwood D.A. Moore B.S. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1998; 120: 7749-7759Crossref Scopus (88) Google Scholar). On the basis of these observations, it was concluded that the bicyclic was a 2,7-dihydroxy-2,3 dihydropyran-4-one substituted at C-5 by the methylenecarboxamide and at C-2 with the 6-methylene-2-hydroxypyran-4-one to give structure LH-2 (Figs. 4 and6), 2-[2,7-dihydroxy-2-(4-hydroxy-6-oxo-4H-pyran-2-methyl-yl)-4- oxochroman-5-yl]-acetamide. LH-3 exhibited many features in common with LH-2 and the presence of the 6-methylene-4-hydroxypyran-2-one and methylenecarboxamide groups could clearly be observed from the NMR spectra (Table II). The13C spectrum again revealed 17 carbon atoms but in this case there were three sp 2 methines and no methylenes associated with the intervening substructure. A carbonyl resonance at δc 177.7 was indicative of a benzopyran-4-one (31Yu T.W. Shen Y. McDaniel R. Floss H.G. Khosla C. Hopwood D.A. Moore B.S. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1998; 120: 7749-7759Crossref Scopus (88) Google Scholar) and there were no signals associated with a benzodihydropyran-4-one, which suggested conversion of the latter to the former through dehydration to give 7-hydroxybenzopyran-4-one. Somewhat surprisingly, however, an HMBC experiment (Fig. 5 c) showed that this compound was not the dehydration product of LH-2. The methylene protons of the methylenecarboxamide group correlated with the oxygen-bearing C-2 carbon of the benzopyran, whereas the methylene linked to the 4-hydroxypyran-2-one correlated with a methine (C-6) and two quaternary carbons (C-4a, C-5) in the benzenoid ring of the benzopyran. The structure of LH-3 (Fig. 6) must, therefore, be 2-[7-hydroxy-5-(4-hydroxy-6-oxo-4H-pyran-2- methyl-yl)-4-oxo-4H-chromen-2-yl]-acetamide. The 13C NMR spectrum of LH-4 revealed only 15 carbons, 9 of which gave chemical shift values comparable to the 2-hydroxy-2,3-dihydrobenzopyran ring system that had already been identified in LH-2, whereas two others were in agreement with expected values for a methylenecarboxamide substituent. However, unlike LH-2, the long range correlations observed in the HMBC spectrum of this compound (Fig. 5 d) revealed that the methylenecarboxamide occurred at the 2-position of the 2,3-dihydropyran-4-one. This left a 4-carbon unit to be placed at C-5 of the benzopyran. This moeity consisted of a methylene, a highly shielded sp 2methine (δ 4.65; δc 86.8) and two quaternarysp 2 carbons. The absence of direct H-H coupling between methylene and methine protons required that they were not adjacent, whereas long range H-C coupling between H-6 of the benzopyran and the methylene carbon meant the latter was linked to C-5 of the pyran. NMR spectra failed to provide conclusive data to support the structure of this side chain but given the polyketide origin of LH-4 a 3-hydroxybut-2-enoic acid substituent is plausible and is not contradicted by the chemical shift values (Table II). The tentative structure proposed for LH-4, as depicted in Fig. 6, is 4-(2-carbamoyl-2,7-dihydroxy-4-oxo-chroman-5-yl)-3-hydroxy-but-2-enoic acid. The initial observation made by Southern blotting, that the minimal PKS and KR for OTC biosynthesis were non-contiguous (16Butler M.J. Binnie C. Hunter I.S. Sugden D.A. Warren M. Dev. Ind. Microbiol. 1990; 31: 41-50Google Scholar), has been confirmed by DNA sequencing and extended now to show that the cyclase gene,otcD1, lies just downstream of the KR (Fig. 2). For most polyketide clusters (e.g. actinorhodin; see Ref. 34Fernandez-Moreno M.A. Martinez E. Boto L. Hopwood D.A. Malpartida F.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 19278-19290Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the genes responsible for the assembly, folding, and cyclization of the backbone are contiguous, although there are some exceptions (e.g. for frenolicin (11Bibb M.J. Sherman D.H. Omura S. Hopwood D.A. Gene. 1994; 142: 31-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) and nogalacin (35Ylihonko K. Tuikkanen J. Jussila S. Cong L. Mantsala P. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1996; 251: 113-120PubMed Google Scholar)). However, it is notable that the KR and cyclase genes for OTC biosynthesis are located a considerable distance (10 kb) from the minimal PKS (Fig. 2,) with genes encoding a variety of disparate functions (e.g.methylase, CoA ligase, and aminotransferase; see Ref. 26Hunter I.S. Hill R.A. Strohl W.R. Bio/Technology of Antibiotics. 2nd Ed. Marcel Decker, Inc., New York1997: 659-682Google Scholar) between the two locations. Thus in the otc cluster, the KR and cyclase genes are expressed on a different mRNA from the PKS genes, which implies that expression of both mRNAs will need to be tightly co-ordinated. The gene product, OtcD1, shows end-to-end homology with putative gene products from other aromatic polyketide gene clusters when comparisons are made using the TBLASTN software (27Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schaffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (59865) Google Scholar). Most notable (56% identity, 75% similarity) is the similarity with the putative aromatase/cyclase of the chlortetracycline biosynthetic cluster (36Ryan, M., Lotvin, J., Strathy, N., and Fantini, S. (1996) U. S. Patent 5589385-AGoogle Scholar). There is also good homology with gene products from other polyketide clusters,e.g. SnoE of the nogalamycin cluster (53%, 64%) (35Ylihonko K. Tuikkanen J. Jussila S. Cong L. Mantsala P. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1996; 251: 113-120PubMed Google Scholar), Gris-Orf4 from the griseucin producer (49%, 61%) (37Yu T.W. Bibb M.J. Revill W.P. Hopwood D.A. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 2627-2634Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), DpsF from the daunorubicin producer (48%, 60%) (38Ye J. Dickens M.L. Plater R. Li Y. Lawrence J. Strohl W.R. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 6270-6280Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and ActVII (45%, 59%) (34Fernandez-Moreno M.A. Martinez E. Boto L. Hopwood D.A. Malpartida F.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 19278-19290Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) from S. coelicolor, the producer of actinorhodin. The N- and C-terminal segments of the deduced OtcD1 polypeptide share homology with each other (26% identity, 35% similarity (Fig. 3)). It is therefore reasonable to deduce that otcD1 encodes a didomain ARO/CYC, which is able to catalyze formation of the carbon-carbon bond that closes a ring and subsequently dehydrates the ring to aromatize it. Set against the existing literature (for review, see Ref. 14Hopwood D.A. Chem. Rev. 1997; 97: 2465-2497Crossref PubMed Scopus (623) Google Scholar), the gene product would be responsible for the closing and aromatizing of the “left” ring (Fig.1) of OTC. The four compounds isolated from theS. rimosus ZGL3 strain are all classical polyketides containing 9, 15, or 17 carbon atoms. They share a common biosynthetic origin, in which three (LH-1), six (LH-4), or seven (LH-2 and LH-3) acetate units have been added to a methylenecarboxamide precursor (Fig.6). Thus, they have been made from a common starter unit through different iterative cycles of the PKS complex. Disruption of otcD1 has thus resulted in loss of specificity of chain length: normally the 19-carbon backbone of OTC is made. The “genetic surgery” performed on the otc cluster to generate the ZGL3 recombinant was some 10 kb distant from the minimal PKS (Fig. 2), which is implicated in specificity of chain length. As otcD1 is transcribed on a different mRNA, expression of the minimal PKS should not have been altered through any polar effect. Our current understanding of chain length elongation in polyketide biosynthesis (e.g. see Ref. 39Kramer P.J. Zawada R.J. McDaniel R. Hutchinson C.R. Hopwood D.A. Khosla C. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1997; 119: 635-639Crossref Scopus (46) Google Scholar) stems from studies with the pRM5/CH999 system in S. coelicolor (7McDaniel R. Ebert-Khosla S. Fu H. Hopwood D.A. Khosla C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 11542-11546Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). The host strain (CH999) is deleted for the entire actinorhodin cluster and the plasmid (pRM5) includes transcriptional activation machinery to ensure high expression of polyketide genes that can be added back to the null strain in different combinations and contexts. By design, this system investigates the molecular interactions among a small number of different gene products. Using hybrid PKS gene sets, the pRM5/CH999 system has shown (7McDaniel R. Ebert-Khosla S. Fu H. Hopwood D.A. Khosla C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 11542-11546Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 8McDaniel R. Ebert-Khosla S. Hopwood D.A. Khosla C. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1993; 115: 11671-11675Crossref Scopus (78) Google Scholar) that the KSβ subunit is a major determinant of chain length. However, specificity is not as absolute as, for example, the frenolicin KS duo direct biosynthesis of a mixture of octa- and nonaketides. The data reported here adopts a different strategy to investigate gene function, to ablate selectively a gene within a chromosomally located cluster and investigate the result. It is presumed that all of the other gene products within the cluster will be expressed normally with the possible exception of those whose genes lie downstream on the same transcript and may be subject to polarity. In the ZGL3 recombinant, disruption of otcD1 has completely “derailed” the capability of the PKS to synthesize polyketides of the usual chain length. This is most likely due to a change in quaternary interactions among the subunits of the PKS complex in the absence of the cyclase/aromatase polypeptide to act as a structural partner. It is not unprecedented that interactions between a cyclase/aromatase and minimal PKS can influence the fidelity of determination of chain length: (a) when the frenolicin minimal PKS was coexpressed with TcmN, the tetracenomycin monodomain cyclase, a nonaketide was produced whereas the minimal PKS alone produced an octaketide (39Kramer P.J. Zawada R.J. McDaniel R. Hutchinson C.R. Hopwood D.A. Khosla C. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1997; 119: 635-639Crossref Scopus (46) Google Scholar); (b) when the C-terminal domain of the ARO/CYC of the griseolin polyketide cluster was co-expressed with the minimal PKS from the tetracenomycin (tcm) cluster, a polyketide of 18 carbons was made, in addition to the usual 20-carbon structure that thetcm gene products specify (40Zawada R.J.X. Khosla C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16184-16188Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar); (c) when thewhiE minimal PKS was expressed alone it made an 18-carbon product, but a 20-carbon polyketide was made when the whiECYC/ARO was co-expressed (37Yu T.W. Bibb M.J. Revill W.P. Hopwood D.A. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 2627-2634Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, the remarkable feature of the products made by the ZGL3 recombinant is the series of polyketide molecules with a wide spectrum of chain lengths, which are shorter, in the case of LH-1 much shorter, than the wild-type strain. These products form a “quasi-homologous” series of chain length. Expression of the minimal PKS from the otc cluster in the pRM5/CH999 system resulted in a polyketide (RM20b, Fig. 4) with a backbone of 20 carbon atoms (9Fu H. Ebert-Khosla S. Hopwood D.A. Khosla C. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1994; 116: 6443-6444Crossref Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The structural similarity between RM20b and LH-3 and SEK4, whose synthesis is directed by the minimal PKS from the actinorhodin pathway, is immediately apparent. Theact system directs synthesis of a 16-carbon structure. On its own, the otc minimal PKS directs synthesis of a 20-carbon polyketide, whereas in wild-type S. rimosus the 19-carbon backbone of OTC is made. In the absence of otcD1,the backbone is reduced to 17 carbons or less. Thus, OtcD1 (as a representative cyclase/aromatase) may have a greater role to play in the determination of chain length than hitherto imagined. Each of the four new structures made by strain ZGL3 has an aminated group, consistent with malonamyl-CoA being used as the starter unit for biosynthesis of these polyketides. In the literature (e.g. see Ref. 26Hunter I.S. Hill R.A. Strohl W.R. Bio/Technology of Antibiotics. 2nd Ed. Marcel Decker, Inc., New York1997: 659-682Google Scholar), it has been hypothesized that malonamyl-CoA is the starter of OTC but, equally, malonyl-CoA could also act as starter with the amination taking place subsequent to completion of the backbone. The elegant work of Thomas and Williams (41Thomas R. Williams D.J. J. Chem. Soc. Chem. Commun. 1983; 7: 443-444Google Scholar, 42Thomas R. Williams D.J. J. Chem. Soc. Chem. Commun. 1983; 12: 128-130Crossref Scopus (34) Google Scholar) used stable isotopic labeling to elucidate the nature of extender units and folding pathway of the backbone of OTC but did not address the issue of the starter unit. The truncated compounds made by ZGL3 are different from OTC in three-dimensional structure and also different from each other. It is unlikely that they would all be substrates for a single enzyme that performs an amination after the backbone is formed. This implies that the carboxamido group is present at the start of biosynthetic process and that malonamyl-CoA is very likely the natural starter unit for the OTC PKS. The presence of the carboxamido group in each of the four structures helps also to resolve the issue of whether truncated polyketide products made by recombinant strains are the result of premature termination of the iterative process of chain extension or degradation products. All polyketide structures reported previously have been derived solely from acetate units, so it was impossible to come to a decision on this issue. Indeed, previous reports (e.g. see Ref. 31Yu T.W. Shen Y. McDaniel R. Floss H.G. Khosla C. Hopwood D.A. Moore B.S. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1998; 120: 7749-7759Crossref Scopus (88) Google Scholar) have included the caveat that the structures could, formally, be the result of degradation of “full-length” chains. The carboxamido group in each of the four novel structures reported here provides a unique “tag” to indicate the point from which chain inititation is made, and affords the conclusion that the structures are the result of different numbers of iterations of chain extension. Although LH-2 and LH-3 are derived from the same progenitor compound, their final structures are the result of different folding/cyclization patterns. LH-3 is the result of a cyclization pattern (Fig. 6) for the first ring (C12/C7) that is typical for cyclization of most aromatic polyketides, including actinorhodin (7McDaniel R. Ebert-Khosla S. Fu H. Hopwood D.A. Khosla C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 11542-11546Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). LH-2 has the unusual C10/C15 cyclization pattern (Fig. 6). Formation of the LH-2 and LH-3 pair thus parallels the situation with SEK4 and SEK4b, which are similarly derived from a single progenitor through different folding routes. The folding pattern of LH-3 is replicated in the 15 carbon compound, LH-4. It is likely that each of the 4 compounds has cyclized spontaneously in the absence of the otcD1 gene product. Each of the novel polyketides, LH-1–LH-4, has a structure that implies that no reduction of a keto group by the KR of the otc cluster has taken place in the ZGL3 recombinant. This is a curious result because the gene encoding the KR is upstream of otcD1. The genetic construction to make the recombinant should have left the KR intact. Three possibilities could plausibly explain this outcome: (i) the KR protein cannot integrate into the PKS assembly when theotcD1 gene product is missing (as is the case in the ZGL3 recombinant); (ii) although the gene encoding the KR is proximal tootcD1 on the polycistronic mRNA, its level of expression may be reduced by instability of the mutant mRNA containing the disrupted ARO/CYC (otcD1::ermE); or (iii) the nascent polyketide backbones of the progenitor structures of LH-1–LH-4 are not substrates for the otcKR. Interestingly, when theotc minimal PKS was co-expressed in S. coelicolorusing the pRM5/CH999 system along with the KR (actIII) from the actinorhodin pathway, then the resulting polyketide had no reduced keto group (9Fu H. Ebert-Khosla S. Hopwood D.A. Khosla C. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1994; 116: 6443-6444Crossref Scopus (51) Google Scholar). In this case, ActIII is either incapable of forming a catalytic partnership with the otc minimal PKS or the 20-carbon product formed by this minimal PKS is not a substrate for ActIII. Addendum—After submission of this manuscript, a paper was published (Shen et al. (1999) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 96, 3622–3627), which shows that ectopic expression of the minimal PKS for WhiE, the polyketide-derived spore pigment of S. coelicolor results in a large number of compounds with different chain length. The authors deduce that the minimal PKS enzyme complex must rely on the stabilizing effects of additional subunits (i.e. the cyclase) to ensure that the chain reaches its full length."

Cell proliferation in these cells was examined. CHO cells that transiently overexpressed the Myc-CK2β subunit exhibited a severe growth defect, as shown by a much lower value of [3H]thymidine incorporation than the vector controls, and a rounded shrunken morphology. In contrast, cells overexpressing Myc-tagged CK2α showed a slightly but consistently higher value of [3H]thymidine incorporation than the controls. The defect in cell growth and changes in morphology caused by Myc-CK2β overexpression were partially rescued by coexpression of Myc-tagged CK2α. In parallel to the studies in CHO cells, the stable transfection of Myc-CK2α and Myc-CK2β subunits was achieved in 3T3 L1 fibroblast cells. Similarly, the ectopic expression of Myc-CK2β, but not Myc-CK2α, caused a growth defect. By measuring [3H]thymidine incorporation, it was found that expression of Myc-CK2β prolonged the G1phase and inhibited up-regulation of cyclin D1 expression during G1. In addition, a lower mitotic index and lower mitotic cyclin-dependent kinase activities were detected in Myc-CK2β-expressing cells. Detailed analysis of stable cells that were synchronously released into the cell cycle revealed that the expression of Myc-CK2β inhibited cells entering into mitosis and prevented the activation of mitotic cyclin-dependent kinases. Taken together, results from both transient and stable expression of CK2 subunits strongly suggest that CK2 may be involved in the control of cell growth and progression of the cell cycle.

Pharmacol. Ther. 1993; 59: 1-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). The holoenzyme form of CK2 is a heterotetramer, composed of α, α′, and β subunits combined to form α2β2, αα′β2, and α′2β2. The α and α′ subunits are catalytically active, whereas the β subunit is thought to be a regulatory subunit that stimulates the catalytic activity of α or α′ subunits and may also influence substrate specificity (for reviews, see Refs. 1Issinger O.-G. Pharmacol. Ther. 1993; 59: 1-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar, 2Tuazon P.T. Traugh J.A. Adv. Second Messenger Phosphoprotein Res. 1991; 23: 126-264Google Scholar, 3Allende J.E.

CK2 exhibits remarkable evolutionary conservation of primary structure in all eukaryotes from yeast to human, e.g. the identity of amino acid sequences of α and β subunits between human and Drosophila melanogasteris 90 and 88%, respectively. The amino acid sequences of the β subunits of human, pig, and chicken are even identical, underscoring this point (5Meisner H. Heller H.R. Buxton J. Czech M.P. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 4072-4076Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 6Gupta S.K. Singh J.P. Gene. 1993; 124: 287-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). The physiological role of CK2 has been explored in yeast and in a number of mammalian cell types, and these studies suggest that the enzyme is involved in cell growth and progression of the cell cycle. For example, genetic studies in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Schizosaccharomyces pombe, and Dictyostelium discoideum(7Padmanabha R. Chen-Wu J.L.-P. Hanna D.E. Glover C.V.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 4089-4099Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar, 8Snell V. Nurse P. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2066-2074Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 9Kikkawa U. Mann S.K.O. Firtel R.A. Hunter T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 5711-5723Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) showed that CK2 activity is essential for cell viability,e.g. the simultaneous disruption of the genes encoding the catalytic subunits, cka1 and cka2, in S. cerevisiae is lethal (7Padmanabha R. Chen-Wu J.L.-P. Hanna D.E. Glover C.V.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 4089-4099Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). An essential role of CK2 in control of cell cycle progression has also been demonstrated in the yeast S. cerevisiae (10Hanna D.E. Rethinaswamy A. Glover C.V.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25905-25914Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Through the use of mutant strains temperature-sensitive for the CK2 gene, the function of CK2 during the cell cycle was analyzed. It was shown that following a shift to the nonpermissive temperature, the mutant strains arrested within a single cell cycle and showed a dual arrest phenotype consisting of 50% of cells in G1 and 50% cells in G2/M. Further analysis by flow cytometry of pheromone-synchronized cells confirmed that CK2 is required at a point beyond Start in G1 prior to S phase. Analysis of hydroxyurea-synchronized cells also confirmed that CK2 is needed for cells cycle progression in the G2/M phases in yeast (10Hanna D.E. Rethinaswamy A. Glover C.V.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25905-25914Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Insofar as the role of CK2 in growth-related functions in mammalian cells is concerned, it has been shown that microinjection of antibodies directed against the β subunit inhibits cell cycle progression in response to serum stimulation in human IMR-90 cells (11Lorenz P. Pepperkok R. Ansorge W. Pyerin W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2733-2739Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). CK2 antisense treatment was found to inhibit cell growth stimulation (12Pepperkok R. Lorenz P. Ansorge W. Pyerin W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6986-6991Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and block neuritogenesis in neuroblastoma cells (13Ulloa L. Diaz-Nido J. Avila J. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 1633-1640Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). In experiments with a transgenic CK2α mouse model, the expression of CK2α, even when seen only at the mRNA level, caused a high predisposition for lymphoma formation, and coexpression with c-Myc resulted in the rapid development of leukemia (14Seldin D.C. Leder P. Science. 1995; 267: 894-897Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). The importance of CK2 on cell growth and cell cycle progression is also suggested by structural analysis of the enzyme and by the fact that a number of CK2 substrates are growth- and cell cycle-related (4Pinna L.A. Meggio F. Prog. Cell Cycle Res. 1997; 3: 77-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar, 21Niefind K. Guerra B. Pinna L.A. Issinger O.G. Schomburg D. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2451-2462Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). The catalytic subunits of CK2, α, and α′, which are highly homologous, are closely related to the p34 cdc2 family, whose activities are required for G1/S and G2/M transitions in the cell cycle (15Hanks S.K. Hunter T. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 576-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (2252) Google Scholar). In addition, both types of subunits of CK2, i.e. the α and β subunits, can be phosphorylated by p34 cdc2 in vitro and in intact cells during mitosis (16Litchfield D.W. Lozeman F.J. Cicirelli M.F.

Chem. 1995; 270: 25872-25878Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Furthermore, p34 cdc2 itself can be phosphorylated by CK2 (19Russo G.L. Yu M.T. Vandenberg I.J. Bae Y.-S. Franza Jr., B.R. Marshak D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20317-20325Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cyclin B1, which binds to and activates p34 cdc2 during mitosis, appears to be phosphorylated by CK2 at the sites that regulate its translocation during mitosis (20Li J. Meyer A.N. Donoghue D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 502-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Despite the numerous findings that suggest a role for CK2 in the control of cell growth, direct evidence obtained by overexpression of this enzyme in cells is still lacking; it has only been previously overexpressed in COS cells, a cell line that normally would not show any phenotype. In the present study, the transient overexpression of the epitope-tagged CK2 subunits, Myc-CK2α and Myc-CK2β, in CHO cells and development of stable cell lines in 3T3 L1 fibroblasts has been achieved. To our knowledge, this is the first paper reporting the successful exogenous expression of CK2 in mammalian cell lines other than COS cells. In both cell systems, it was found that the expression of Myc-CK2β caused severe impairment of growth. An analysis of the 3T3 L1/Myc-CK2β stable cell lines showed that similar to what was observed in yeast (10Hanna D.E. Rethinaswamy A. Glover C.V.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25905-25914Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar), the growth inhibition appears to be linked to defects in the progression of the cell cycle. The Myc-tagged human CK2α and CK2β cDNAs were subcloned from pCS/CK2α and pCS/CK2β plasmids (22Chen M. Li D. Krebs E.G. Cooper J.A. Mol. Cell.

Polyclonal anti-Myc antibody A-14, monoclonal anti-cyclin B1 antibody GNS1, rabbit polyclonal anti-cyclin A antibody C-19, and rabbit polyclonal anti-cyclin D1 antibody H295 were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Monoclonal anti-Myc antibody 9E10 was a gift from Dr. J. A. Cooper (University of Washington, Seattle). Polyclonal anti-CK2α and -β antisera were raised against synthetic peptides and were employed in our study as described elsewhere (24Litchfield D.W. Lozeman F.J. Piening C. Sommercorn J. Takio K. Walsh K.A. Krebs E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 7638-7644Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Monoclonal anti-cdc2 antibody was from Transduction Laboratories. Monoclonal MPM2 antibody, which was raised against phosphoproteins during mitosis, was from Upstate Biotechnology. Chinese hamster ovary cells (CHO cells) were cultured in 150-mm plates containing F10 medium with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS) and grown to confluency. A day prior to the transfection, the cells were trypsinized and plated after a one to two dilution and were allowed to grow for another 24 h. For transfection, the cells were trypsinized, washed by centrifugation with growth medium followed by phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), resuspended in 0.5 ml of PBS, pH 7.4 (Life Technologies, Inc.), and transfected by electroporation (Gene Pulser, Bio-Rad) at 0.35 kV and 926 microfarads. After electroporation, 1 ml of growth medium was added quickly, and the cells were plated. Twelve h later, the medium was changed, and cells were grown for another 24–36 h before being harvested by sonication in Buffer A (50 mm β-glycerol phosphate, pH 7.3, 20 μmvanadate, 1 mm dithiothreitol (DTT), 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Transfection of CHO cells by using Lipofectin Reagent was also performed following a protocol from Life Technologies, Inc. 3T3 L1 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% FCS. Twenty-four h before the transfection, the cells were plated on a 100-mm plate at a density of 0.5 × 106 cells/plate. A standard calcium phosphate coprecipitation method was used for transfection. Twenty-four h after the transfection, the cells were cultured in the presence of 800 μg/ml G418 (Calbiochem). After 2 weeks, the clones were picked and grown in the same medium in the presence of 600 μg/ml G418. To harvest cells, they were washed with PBS and lysed by sonication in Buffer A containing 0.1 m NaCl and 0.25% Triton X-100. Stable cell lines of 3T3 L1/Myc-α and 3T3 L1/Myc-β were seeded at a density of 2.5 × 105 cells/150-mm plate in DMEM with 10% FCS (full medium). After 24 h, the cells were washed with PBS and then starved in DMEM containing 0.1% FCS for 48 h to synchronize cells in G0. Re-entry into the G1 phase of cell cycle was initiated by replacement of the starvation medium with the full medium. For analysis of the G2/M phase, the cells were first starved at G0and then synchronized to the G1/S boundary by culturing in full medium and 1 μg/ml aphidicolin (Sigma) for 18 h. After extensive washing, the cells were cultured in full medium and harvested at different time intervals. Monoclonal anti-Myc antibody 9E10 (10 μg) was added to 400 μl of crude cell lysates containing approximately 1 mg/ml total protein. The mixture was incubated for 2 h at 4 °C. Then 40 μl of a mixture of protein A-Sepharose (Sigma) and protein G-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) (1:1, 50% slurry) was added, and incubation was continued for another 90 min. The beads were spun down and washed 4 times by centrifugation in a wash buffer containing 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 0.15 m NaCl, and 2 mm EDTA. The immunoprecipitated Myc-CK2 proteins were subjected to SDS-PAGE and then transferred onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane and detected by immunoblotting with 9E10 hybridoma supernatant. The rate of stable clones of CK2 transfected 3T3 cells proliferation was measured by counting the number of cells after cells were plated. Briefly, cells were seeded at a density of 2500 cells/35-mm plate, with duplicate plates for each cell line. Every 24 h, the cells were trypsinized and counted using a hemocytometer (25Seger R. Seger D. Reszka A.A. Munar E.S. Eldar-Finkelman H. Dobrowolska G. Jensen A.M. Campbell J.S. Fischer E.H. Krebs E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25699-25709Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For CHO cells, after electroporation, cells were seeded in 6-well/35-mm plates at a density of one-tenth of the total transfected cells per well. At 12 h after transfection, the transfection medium was removed, and the cells were washed three times with PBS and cultured in fresh medium (2 ml) containing 1 μCi/ml [methyl-3H]thymidine 5′-triphosphate (NEN Life Science Products) for another 24 h. To eliminate the possibility that the cell density between plates might be different after transfection, which could cause variations in the value of3H incorporation, two extra plates were plated and used to count the cell number for each transfection at the time when [3H]thymidine was added. For harvesting cells, the growth medium containing [3H]thymidine was removed, and the cells were then washed twice with PBS. The cells were rinsed twice with 2 ml of ice-cold 5% trichloroacetic acid and lysed by incubation in 1.5 ml of 0.25 m NaOH for 15 min at room temperature. 0.6 ml of lysates was used for counting [3H]thymidine incorporation. Stable cell lines of 3T3 L1/Myc-α and 3T3 L1/Myc-β were plated using 35-mm/6-well plates at a density of 5 × 104cells/plate. After 24 h, the cells were starved for 36 h in 2 ml of DMEM containing 0.1% FCS, followed by growing in 10% FCS medium containing 1 μCi/ml [3H]thymidine for 18 h. The cells were harvested at various time points and 3H incorporation was measured as described for CHO cells. For all of the experiments, duplicate plates were used and mean values were taken. The cyclin B1-associated p34 cdc2 and the cyclin A-associated CDKs were co-immunoprecipitated from stable cell lines of 3T3 L1/Myc-α and 3T3 L1/Myc-β using the anti-cyclin B1 antibody, GNS1, and the anti-cyclin A antibody C-19, respectively. The CDK activities were measured using histone H1 (Sigma) as the substrate. Briefly, for asynchronized cells, the actively growing cells (60–70% confluent) were harvested and lysed by sonication in Buffer A. Then 500 μl of the crude cell lysates (1 mg of protein/ml of lysate) was incubated with either 1 μg of the anti-cyclin B1 antibody or the anti-cyclin A antibody for 3 h at 4 °C. After this, 40 μl (50% slurry) of protein G-Sepharose (for cyclin B1 immunoprecipitates) or protein A-Sepharose (for cyclin A immunoprecipitates) was added and incubated for another 90 min. The immunoprecipitates were washed once with lysis buffer and three times with a wash buffer containing 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 0.25m NaCl, 10 mm MnCl2, and 1 mm DTT. Reactions were initiated by addition of 30 μl of an assay buffer containing 4 μg of histone H1, 20 mmMgCl2, 7 mm MnCl2, 150 mm NaCl, and 0.1 mm [γ-32P]ATP (2000 cpm/pmol ATP). The reactions were carried out for 30 min in an incubator shaker at 37 °C and then stopped by addition of Laemmli sample buffer. 2J. H. Wright, E. S. Munar, D. R. Jameson, P. Andreassan, R. Margolis, R. Seger, and E. G. Krebs, submitted for publication. Phosphorylation of histone H1 was analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. Cells that were starved for 24 h by growth in a medium containing 0.1% FCS were used as a negative control. The CK2 assays were performed using crude cell lysates (harvested by sonication in Buffer H) and a peptide substrate, RRRDDDSDDD, as described previously (26Kuenzel E.A. Mulligan J.A. Sommercorn J. Krebs E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 9136-9140Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 27Litchfield D.W. Lozeman F.J. Cicirelli M.F. Harrylock M. Ericsson L.H. Piening C.J. Krebs E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 20380-20389Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). CHO cells that were transfected with the Myc-tagged CK2 constructs were seeded onto a 60-mm plate. At 24 h after transfection the cells were washed with PBS and fixed with −20 °C methanol for 5 min. The fixed cells were blocked with a TBST buffer (50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, 0.15 m NaCl, 0.05% Tween) containing 5% goat serum for 1 h and then incubated overnight in blocking buffer containing a monoclonal anti-Myc antibody 9E10 (final concentration = 4.5 μg/ml). The plates were then washed six times with TBST and incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated secondary anti-mouse antibody (BioSource International, 1:1000 dilution) for 2 h. After washing five times with TBST, the plates were viewed using a Nikon Diaphot-TMD Inverted fluorescent microscope (28Reszka A.A. Bulinski J.C. Krebs E.G. Fischer E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 1219-1232Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The percentage of cells in elongated or rounded shape was determined for both the Myc-positive and Myc-negative (untransfected) populations. For determination of mitotic cells in 3T3 L1 stable clones, the same fixing and staining procedures were applied by using a monoclonal MPM2 antibody as the primary antibody. The percentage of mitotic cells was determined by counting MPM2-positive cells under the microscope. CHO cells were transiently transfected either with plasmids of each of the epitope-tagged CK2 subunits alone, pcDNA3/Myc-CK2α and pcDNA3/Myc-CK2β, or cotransfected with both subunits. The vector plasmid pcDNA3 was used as a control. In this system, by electroporation under the condition specified, the transfection efficiency was found to be greater than 50% as determined using the green fluorescence protein plasmid or by anti-Myc antibody immunostaining (data not shown). At 36–48 h after transfection, cells were harvested, and the overexpression of CK2 was detected by CK2 kinase assays (26Kuenzel E.A. Mulligan J.A. Sommercorn J. Krebs E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 9136-9140Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 27Litchfield D.W. Lozeman F.J. Cicirelli M.F. Harrylock M. Ericsson L.H. Piening C.J. Krebs E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 20380-20389Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and by immunoblotting using anti-CK2α and anti-CK2β antisera raised against the C-terminal peptides of each subunit of human CK2 (23Lozeman F.J. Litchfield D.W. Piening C. Takio K. Walsh K.A. Krebs E.G. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 8436-8447Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). As illustrated in Fig.1 A, the Myc-tagged CK2 subunits migrated slower than the endogenous CK2 proteins on SDS-PAGE due to the Myc epitope. The approximate size for Myc-CK2α and Myc-CK2β is 60 and 44 kDa, respectively. Each Myc-CK2 subunit was strongly overexpressed in this system, with a more than 5-fold increase over the endogenous level of non-tagged protein. Cotransfection of Myc-CK2α with Myc-CK2β also gave good expression of each subunit (Fig. 1 A). To examine if the overexpressed Myc-CK2 proteins were enzymatically active, the CK2 activities in lysates of cells that were transfected with Myc-CK2 subunits or cotransfected with combinations of them were determined using a peptide substrate, RRRDDDSDDD. An appreciably higher CK2 activity was detected in cells that were transfected with the Myc-CK2α than in cells that were transfected with pcDNA3 vector alone, showing that the overexpressed recombinant CK2α was active (Fig. 1 B). A further activation of CK2 was detected when cells were cotransfected with Myc-CK2α and Myc-CK2β, implying that the Myc-tagged subunits are capable of combining to give holoenzyme forms that exhibit higher activities than that obtained with the free tagged CK2α subunits (Fig. 1 B). One distinctive phenotypic change observed for cells that were transfected with the Myc-CK2β construct was that they had a slower proliferation rate than the non-transfected controls. It took an additional 24 h for Myc-CK2β-expressing cells to reach confluence as compared with vector controls or Myc-CK2α-expressing cells. To examine the proliferation rate quantitatively, the relative levels of DNA synthesis were monitored by measuring [3H]thymidine incorporation. As anticipated, there were reproducible differences between cells that were transfected with Myc-CK2β and vector controls; the cells that were transfected with Myc-CK2β clearly showed values of [3H]thymidine incorporation that were approximately 50% of the vector control (Fig.1 C). Since the transfection efficiency was approximately 50%, it is likely that the Myc-CK2β expressing cells were not incorporating thymidine at all. Transfection of cells with Myc-CK2α resulted in slightly higher values of [3H]thymidine incorporation (approximately 20% higher) than the cells transfected with pcDNA3 vector alone. Transfection of these cells with Myc-CK2β again depressed [3H]thymidine incorporation but not to the levels reached with Myc-CK2β transfection without cotransfection of the α subunit (Fig. 1 C). The slow growing cells transfected with Myc-CK2β also showed changes in morphology. In the normal growing state, CHO cells exhibit a flat, elongated morphology, which allows them to become attached to the plate and proliferate. After transfection with the vector or with the Myc-CK2α, the cells fully recovered from the shock caused by electroporation within 24 h and resumed their normal morphology. However, with the expression of exogenous Myc-CK2β, a large population of cells had a rounded appearance, consistent with the morphology of growth-arrested cells. To further extend these observations, an immunostaining technique was applied using anti-Myc antibody with cells that had been transfected with the various Myc-tagged CK2 constructs. The percentages of cells in rounded or elongated shape were determined microscopically. In this case, most of the cells that overexpressed Myc-CK2β showed the round shape, whereas only a small fraction of the cells that overexpressed Myc-CK2α exhibited this morphology (Fig. 2 A and B). Cotransfection of CK2α with CK2β partially rescued this phenotype. To exclude further the possibility that the observed phenotype could be introduced by this specific transfection technique (electroporation), a different transfection method, lipofection, was applied. Similar results were obtained (data not shown). Of interest was the fact that in many ways the rounded cells overexpressing CK2β exhibited morphologic changes that occur in apoptosis. They had a shrunken appearance and eventually died. At 48 h after transfection, by co-staining with anti-Myc antibody and DNA staining with Hoechst dye, most of Myc-CK2β expressing cells were observed to exhibit chromosomal condensation and fragmentation, which is characteristic of apoptotic cell death (data not shown). On the other hand, very few cells that overexpressed Myc-CK2α showed such changes in the cell nuclei. In order to study long term cellular effects of expressing CK2 subunits, the stable expression of Myc-CK2β and Myc-CK2α was carried out using 3T3 L1 fibroblasts. After transfection of cells with the Myc-tagged CK2 subunits, multiple clones were examined for expression of proteins. Two approaches were applied as follows: one was by immunoblotting of crude cell lysates with anti-Myc antibody or anti-CK2 antibodies and another was by immunoprecipitation with anti-Myc antibody followed by immunoblotting with either anti-Myc antibody or with CK2 subunit antibodies. With the first method it was questionable whether or not the Myc-tagged CK2 subunits could even be seen regardless of which type of immunoblotting was employed, although the endogenous subunits were readily apparent,i.e. the blotting with anti-CK2 subunit antibodies (Fig.3 A). However, when initial immunoprecipitations were carried out, the expression of Myc-tagged CK2α and CK2β subunits was detectable (Fig. 3 B). Multiple clones were examined, and 10 clones, 3 expressing Myc-CK2α at different levels and 7 expressing Myc-CK2β, again at different levels, were selected for further study (Fig. 3 B and TableI). For the most part, these studies made use of clones α12, α13, β3, and β6, with clones β3 and α12 representative of the highest and clones α13 and β6 representative of a lower level of expression (Fig. 3 B and Table I). Cells that were stably transfected with pcDNA3 vector were used as a control. The enzymatic activity of CK2 in these cells was also examined using a specific CK2 peptide substrate, RRRDDDSDDD. No significant change of CK2 activity was detected in any of these cell lines, consistent with the concept that the total concentration of CK2α-tagged plus untagged underwent very little change as a result of the expression of the Myc-tagged subunits.Table IStable clones of 3T3 L1/Myc-CK2α and 3T3 L1/Myc-CK2β cellsConstructsTotal number of clones examinedClones that express CK2 subunitsPercent relative expression level from densitometer readingarbitrary unitspcDNA3/Myc-CK2α10α12100α1330α173pcDNA3/Myc-CK2β9β135β210β3100β420β620β730β8303T3 L1 cells transfected with Myc-CK2α and Myc-CK2β were examined for expression of Myc-tagged proteins by immunoprecipitation with anti-Myc antibody followed by immunoblotting by anti-Myc.

We show here that replacement of Arg72 by alanine strongly alters fidelity in a highly unusual manner. R72A reverse transcriptase is a frameshift and base substitution antimutator polymerase whose increased fidelity results both from increased nucleotide selectivity and from a decreased ability to extend mismatched primer termini. Thus, Arg72-substrate interactions in wild-type human immunodeficiency virus type 1 RT can stabilize incorrect nucleotides allowing misinsertion and promoting extension of mismatched and perhaps misaligned template-primers. In contrast to the higher fidelity at most sites, R72A RT is highly error-prone for misincorporations opposite template T in the sequence context: 5′-CTGG. Surprisingly, this results mostly from a 1200-fold increase in the apparent K m for correct dAMP incorporation. Thus, Arg72 interactions with substrate are critical for the stability of the correct T·dAMP base pair when the 5′-CTGG sequence is present in the binding pocket for the nascent base pair. Collectively, the data show that a mutant polymerase may yield higher than normal average replication fidelity, yet paradoxically place specific sequences at very high risk of mutation.

Where exonucleolytic proofreading is possible, fidelity also depends on the preferential extension of the newly formed correct base pair but not mismatched or misaligned template-primers. Energetic differences between correct and incorrect base pairs in duplex DNA in solution are insufficient to account for the degree of DNA polymerase discrimination at the insertion step (reviewed in Ref. 1Loeb L.A. Kunkel T.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1982; 51: 429-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar), implying important roles for DNA polymerases in determining replication fidelity.

Goodman M.F. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1991; 60: 477-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (611) Google Scholar). The shape of this pocket can precisely accommodate complementary Watson-Crick base pairs, but may exclude non-complementary base pairs that have altered geometry and/or that form hydrogen bonds with solvent (10Petruska J. Sowers L.C. Goodman M.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 1559-1562Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 11Kool E.T. Biopolymers. 1998; 48: 3-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). One approach to probe the role of polymerases in determining replication fidelity is to study mutant polymerases whose specific protein-substrate interactions are altered. Here we use this strategy to investigate the fidelity of HIV-11 RT. HIV-1 RT lacks an intrinsic 3′ → 5′ exonucleolytic activity (12Roberts J.D. Bebenek K. Kunkel T.A. Science. 1988; 242: 1171-1173Crossref PubMed Scopus (722) Google Scholar) and therefore does not proofread replication errors. It has misinsertion properties typical of other proofreading-deficient DNA polymerases, but is promiscuous in its ability to extend mismatched primer termini (13Perrino F.W. Preston B.D. Sandell L.L. Loeb L.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 8343-8347Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 14Yu H. Goodman M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 10888-10896Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This latter property has been suggested to reflect the ability and need to efficiently strand switch during viral replication in vivo(15Temin H.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6900-6903Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar, 16Patel P.H. Preston B.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 549-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). HIV-1 RT is inaccurate for frameshift and base substitution errors initiated by template-primer slippage in homonucleotide runs (17Bebenek K. Abbotts J. Roberts J.D. Wilson S.H. Kunkel T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 16948-16956Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Bebenek K. Abbotts J. Wilson S.H. Kunkel T.A. J. Biol.

Important to this type of infidelity are five amino acids in HIV-1 RT, which interact with the DNA minor groove two to six base pairs upstream of the active site. When changed to alanine, each of the five mutant RTs has lower DNA binding affinity, lower processivity and altered fidelity for errors initiated by template-primer slippage (20Bebenek K. Beard W.A. Darden T.A. Li L. Prasad R. Luxon B.A. Gorenstein D.G. Wilson S.H. Kunkel T.A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 3: 194-197Crossref Scopus (113) Google Scholar). More recently, the structure of a ternary complex of HIV-1 RT bound to template-primer and dTTP has been described (6Huang H. Chopra R. Verdine G.L. Harrison S.C. Science. 1998; 282: 1669-1675Crossref PubMed Scopus (1346) Google Scholar). This structure in which the RT is poised for catalysis provides the location of amino acids at the active site that interact with the catalytic metals, the primer terminus and the incoming dNTP. Comparison to the structure of a RT·DNA complex (21Jacobo-Molina A. Ding J. Nanni R.G. Clark Jr., A.D. Lu X. Tantillo C. Williams R.L. Kamer G. Ferris A.L. Clark P. Hizi A. Hughes S.H. Arnold E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6320-6324Crossref PubMed Scopus (1114) Google Scholar) reveals that binding of the dNTP results in a “closed” conformation (Fig. 1 A) wherein amino acids in the β3-β4 loop of the fingers subdomain move to form one wall of the binding pocket for the nascent base pair (Fig. 1 B). Among these amino acids is Arg72 (red in Fig. 1,B and C). The guanidinium group of Arg72 stacks against the base of the incoming dNTP (Fig. 1,B and C) and donates hydrogen bonds to the α-phosphate (Fig. 1 C). Although several residues in the dNTP binding pocket of RT are altered during acquisition of drug resistance to nucleoside inhibitors (e.g., Lys65, Leu74, and Gln151), RT mutants with an amino acid substitution at position 72 have not been reported among drug-resistant HIV-1 isolates, nor were Arg72 substitutions found in a screen for HIV-1 RT mutants that complement the growth defect of a temperature-sensitive E. coli DNA polymerase I mutant (22Kim B. Hathaway T.R. Loeb L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4872-4878Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). These results, as well as the high conservation of Arg72 among retroviral reverse transcriptases and telomerases (23Xiong Y. Eickbush T.H. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 3353-3362Crossref PubMed Scopus (1119) Google Scholar, 24Lingner J. Hughes T.R. Shevchenko A. Mann M. Lundblad V. Cech T.R. Science. 1997; 276: 561-567Crossref PubMed Scopus (1028) Google Scholar) and the fact that an R72A mutant RT has a reduced k cat, is resistant to a pyrophosphate analog, is deficient in pyrophosphorolysis, and is compromised in translocation (25Sarafianos S.G. Pandey V.N. Kaushik N. Modak M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19729-19735Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), point to the functional importance of Arg72. This, and the structural data indicating that Arg72 forms part of the binding pocket for the nascent base pair, prompted the current examination of the effects of modifying the interactions between Arg72 and the incoming nucleotide on the fidelity of DNA synthesis. Here we show that a HIV-1 RT mutant with an R72A substitution has fidelity properties that are unique among known DNA polymerases. Arginine 72 in HXB2 HIV-1 RT was changed to alanine by oligonucleotide-directed mutageneis as described (26Kunkel T.A. Bebenek K. McClary J.

Synthesis errors in the reversion assays are scored as blue-plaque revertants of M13 substrates containing mutations encoding colorless plaques. Base substitutions were monitored at a TGA codon at position 87–89 in the reporter gene, with any of eight different mispairs yielding blue plaques. Single-nucleotide deletion errors were monitored in a template TTTTT run (30Kroutil L.C. Register K. Bebenek K. Kunkel T.A. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 1046-1053Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Synthesis reactions (25 μl) contained 35 fmol of gapped M13mp2 DNA, 1–5 pmol of RT, 1 mm each of the four dNTPs, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 10 mmMgCl2, and 2 mm dithiothreitol. Reactions were incubated for 1 h at 37 °C, and all reactions filled the gaps to apparent completion (19Bebenek K. Kunkel T.A.

The T-P was poly(rA)-oligo(dT)20, poly(rC)-oligo(dG)15, or poly(dC)-oligo(dG)15, and the variable nucleotide was [α-32P]TTP or [α-32P]dGTP. Reactions were initiated by the addition of enzyme, incubated at 22 °C and quenched by the addition of 20 μl of 0.5 m EDTA, pH 8.0. Quenched reaction mixtures were processed as described previously (29Beard W.A. Stahl S.J. Kim H.-R. Bebenek K. Kumar A. Strub M.-P. Becerra S.P. Kunkel T.A. Wilson S.H. J. Biol.

Oligonucleotide template and primers were from Oligos Etc. Oligonuclotide primers were 5′-radiolabeled with T4 polynucleotide kinase and unincorporated nucleotides removed by gel filtration on a Super Sect-D, G-25 column (5 Prime→3 Prime, Inc.). T-Ps were prepared by incubating template and primer oligonucleotides in a 2:1 ratio at 85 °C for 1 min and then allowing the mixture to cool slowly to room temperature. The following T-Ps were used. T-P B is identical to that used by Kati et al. (31Kati W.M. Johnson K.A. Jerva L.F. Anderson K.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25988-25997Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Template C contains a “hot spot” sequence (underlined) identified for R72A RT. Polymerization reactions (20 μl) contained 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 200 nm T-P, and variable concentrations of dGTP or dATP. The concentration of the wild-type enzyme in all reactions with the A and B templates was 30 nm. In reactions with the C template, the concentration of the enzyme was 30 nm for dATP insertion and 150 nm for dGTP insertion. The concentration of the R72A RT in reactions with all three templates was 30 nm and 150 nm for dATP and dGTP insertion, respectively. Reactions were initiated by the addition of a solution of RT and DNA, incubated at 37 °C, and quenched between 1 and 10 min by adding an equal volume of 95% formamide, 20 mm EDTA, 0.05% bromphenol blue, and 0.05% xylene cyanol FF. Products were analyzed on 16% polyacylamide gels with 8 m urea. Substrate and product bands were quantified by phosphorimagery and analyzed as described previously (32Boosalis M.S. Petruska J. Goodman M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 14689-14696Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The data were fitted to the Michaelis-Menten equation by nonlinear least-squares methods, to obtain apparentk cat/K m values. Reactions were as outlined for insertion kinetics. Templates A and C were used with primers one nucleotide longer than the corresponding primers in the diagram to create either correctly matched (T·dATP) or mismatched (T·dGTP) primer termini. The insertion of the next correct nucleotide, dGTP, was measured. Varying the concentration of the next correct nucleotide, dGTP, enabled us to determine apparentk cat/K m values for extension of matched and mismatched base pairs (33Mendelman L.V. Petruska J. Goodman M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 2338-2346Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 34Creighton S. Huang M.-M. Cai H. Arnheim N. Goodman M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 2633-2639Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In reactions with the A template, the RT concentrations were 10 and 15 nm for the wild-type and R72A RT, respectively. In reactions with the C template, the concentration of the wild-type RT was 15 nm and the concentration of the R72A enzyme was 30 nm. Kinetic parameters for polymerization by wild-type and R72A RT were determined with poly(rA)oligo(dT)20, poly(rC)- oligo(dG)15, and poly(dC)oligo(dG)15 (TableI). The K m, dNTP of the mutant RT was higher than that of wild-type RT with the RNA templates, but not with the homopolymeric DNA template (i.e. poly(dC)). With all three substrates, the mutant RT had a lowerk cat than wild-type. These differences result in catalytic efficiencies (k cat/K m, dNTP) for the R72A mutant that are 1150-, 92-, and 20-fold lower than for wild-type RT on poly(rA)oligo(dT)20, poly(rC)oligo(dG)15, and poly(dC)oligo(dG)15, respectively.Table IApparent kinetic parameters of wild-type and R72A RT on homopolymeric template-primersTemplate/primer and dNTP substrateEnzymeK m,dNTPk catk cat/K m (× 103)(k cat/K m )Wild-type/ (k cat/K m )R72Aμms −1μm −1 s −1Poly(rA)-oligo(dT)20, TTPWild-type2.4 ± 0.20.22 ± 0.0192R72A92 ± 60.007 ± 0.0010.081150Poly(rC)-oligo(dG)15, dGTPWild-type0.7 ± 0.10.17 ± 0.01240R72A11.1 ± 0.90.029 ± 0.0012.692Poly(dC)-oligo(dG)15, dGTPWild-type7.6 ± 1.50.83 ± 0.08110R72A2.4 ± 0.030.013 ± 0.0015.420Values are the weighted average and standard error of at least two determinations.

The fidelity of DNA-dependent DNA synthesis catalyzed by the R72A and wild-type RT was determined using assays that score RT errors as blue M13mp2 revertants of a colorless plaque phenotype. One assay detects eight different substitutions at a TGA codon (lacZ nucleotides 87–89), and the other detects one-nucleotide deletions in a mononucleotide run of template thymidines (lacZnucleotides 70–74). The results (TableII) indicate that R72A RT is 37-fold less accurate than wild-type RT for base substitution errors at the opal codon in this particular sequence context. In marked contrast, the mutant is 20-fold more accurate for frameshift errors than wild-type. This indicates a significant difference in error specificity for the R72A and wild-type RT. To explore specificity in more detail, we employed a third fidelity assay that scores errors as light blue and colorless M13 plaques resulting from a variety of substitutions and frameshifts at over 100 template positions within the lacZgene (19Bebenek K. Kunkel T.A. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 262: 217-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). With this assay, the R72A generated lacZ mutants at a frequency that was 1.6-fold higher than that of the wild-type RT (Table II). Despite this small change in mutant frequency, sequence analysis of lacZ mutants revealed a remarkable difference in the error specificity of R72A RT relative to wild-type (Fig. 2 and Table III).

Open table in a new tab The error rates are calculated based on the number of mutants included in the analysis (223 and 180 for the wild-type and R72A RTs, respectively) and the forward mutant frequencies from Table II. As expected from earlier studies (17Bebenek K. Abbotts J. Roberts J.D. Wilson S.H. Kunkel T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 16948-16956Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Bebenek K. Abbotts J. Wilson S.H. Kunkel T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10324-10334Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), wild-type RT generates both substitution and frameshift errors at numerous template positions. The spectrum (Fig. 2 A) is dominated by deletions in mononucleotide runs at template positions 70–73, 88–90, 91–94, 132–136, and 137–139 and by base substitutions at −36. Previous studies (18Bebenek K. Abbotts J. Wilson S.H. Kunkel T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10324-10334Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) had suggested that the deletions, and most of these base substitutions, result from template-primer slippage. In contrast, only two frameshifts are present in the R72A mutant spectrum (Fig.2 B), and there is only one substitution at site −36. When the results are used to calculate error rates per detectable nucleotide incorporated (Table III), the mutant RT is 25-fold more accurate than wild-type for one-nucleotide deletions and for T → C substitutions at position −36. Thus, R72A RT is a strong antimutator polymerase for misalignment-mediated errors in a variety of sequence contexts. Also absent from the R72A RT error spectrum are the majority of base substitutions at other template locations (Fig. 2). The base substitution fidelity of the R72A mutant, representing an average value for all 12 mismatches at a variety of locations, is 3.3-fold higher than that of wild-type RT (TableIII). A second remarkable feature of the error specificity of R72A RT are the hot spots for misincorporation at positions 87 and 147 of thelacZ gene (Fig. 2 B). Both positions are template thymidines within the sequence 5′-CTGG. The R72A RT error rates for T → C transitions at these sites are 87- and 200-fold higher, respectively, than for wild-type RT (Table III). T → G transversions are also generated at position 147, at a rate that is at least 24-fold higher than that of wild-type RT. In gap-filling fidelity assays, the recovery of lacZ mutants containing base substitutions requires both misinsertion and mismatch extension. To determine the contribution of selectivity during the insertion step to the observed changes in error specificity, we compared the kinetic parameters for insertion of correct dATP and incorrect dGTP opposite template T by R72A and wild-type RT. Insertion was first measured using two T-Ps (A and B; see “Experimental Procedures”) that were not hot spots for misincorporation by R72A RT. With both template-primers, R72A RT has lower catalytic efficiency (k cat/K m ) than wild-type RT for insertion of correct dAMP and incorrect dGMP (TableIV). This primarily reflects much higherK m values for the incoming nucleotides, withk cat values much less affected. Like wild-type RT, R72A inserts incorrect dGMP with substantially lower efficiencies than it inserts correct dAMP. For both enzymes, this is primarily a result of a ≥100-fold increase in K m for the incorrect nucleotide, although a small decrease ink cat for dGTP insertion is also observed for R72A RT. When the frequency of G misinsertion, (k cat/K m )incorrect/(k cat/K m )correct, is calculated from the data in Table IV, the R72A RT is observed to have 4- and 92-fold lower misinsertion frequencies than wild-type RT, with T-P A and B, respectively (Fig. 3). Thus, substitution of alanine for Arg72 in HIV-1 RT results in higher than normal discrimination against misinsertion of dGMP opposite T at these two template positions.Table IVKinetic parameters for insertion by wild-type and R72A RTEnzymedNTPK mk cat(app)(k cat/K m )app(× 103)μmmin −1(μm · min) −1 Non-hot spot template-primer A.

Open table in a new tab The values of the kinetic parameters, K m andk cat(app) are the weighted average and standard error from at least two independent measurements. Next, we examine insertion kinetics at the hottest site of misincorporation by R72A RT (position 147, T-P C). Kinetic parameters for correct dAMP insertion by wild-type RT were similar to those observed with the other sequences (Table IV). However, the efficiency of dGMP misinsertion by wild-type RT is significantly lower at the hot spot than at the two other sites. At position 147, the wild-type RT has a 700-fold higher K m and a 16-fold lowerk cat for misinsertion of dGMP than for correct dAMP insertion, resulting in a 10,000-fold lower efficiency for dGMP misinsertion than for correct insertion (Table IV). Consequently, the dGMP misinsertion frequency at the 147 site by wild-type RT is 70- and 170-fold lower than at thymidines in templates A and B, respectively (Fig. 3). Insertion of correct dAMP at position 147 by the R72A RT is characterized by a remarkably high K m of 240 μm. This value is 1200-fold higher than for wild-type RT at this same site, and it is approximately 30-fold higher than those observed for R72A RT with the non-hot spot T-Ps A and B. In contrast to the large enzyme- and DNA-dependent differences inK m for correct nucleotide, R72A RT hask cat values for correct dAMP insertion andK m and k cat values for incorrect insertion of dGMP at position 147 that are similar to those observed with the other T-Ps (Table IV). As a consequence, the R72A RT has a misinsertion frequency at position 147 that is 220-fold higher than that of wild-type RT (Fig. 3). This parallels the 200-fold increased error rate for stable misincorporation of dGMP opposite T at position 147 in the M13mp2 fidelity assay (Table III), and is in marked contrast to the lower misinsertion rate of the R72A mutant RT in the other two sequence contexts (Fig. 3). The above kinetic analysis with T-Ps A and B suggest that the higher fidelity of the R72A RT is partly due to increased discrimination during insertion. To test the hypothesis that higher fidelity might also result from increased discrimination against extension of mismatched primer termini, we compared the ability of wild-type and R72A RT to extend a template-primer with a terminal T·G mispair. With T-P A, the wild-type enzyme extends the correctly paired and mispaired T-P termini with similar efficiency (TableV). This is consistent with the well known promiscuity of wild-type RT for mismatch extension (13Perrino F.W. Preston B.D. Sandell L.L. Loeb L.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 8343-8347Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 14Yu H. Goodman M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 10888-10896Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and the fact that the T·G mismatch is among the most readily extended of the 12 possible mispairs (e.g., see Refs. 9Echols H. Goodman M.F. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1991; 60: 477-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (611) Google Scholar and 33Mendelman L.V. Petruska J. Goodman M.F. J. Biol.

N-acetylglucosamine-1-phosphodiester α-N-acetylglucosaminidase polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis expressed sequence tag polymerase chain reaction bp, base pair kilobase pair The biosynthesis of the mannose 6-phosphate recognition signal on the oligosaccharides of lysosomal acid hydrolases occurs in the Golgi apparatus and is catalyzed by the sequential action of two enzymes. The first step is the addition of N-acetylglucosamine-1-P to the C-6 hydroxyl group on selected mannose residues in the high mannose oligosaccharides of lysosomal enzymes that serve as substrates for UDP-N-acetylglucosamine:lysosomal enzymeN-acetylglucosamine-1-phosphotransferase. The second step is catalyzed by N-acetylglucosamine-1-phosphodiester α-N-acetylglucosaminidase (phos-phodiester α-GlcNAcase),1 which removes the covering GlcNAc to expose the mannose 6-phosphate recognition signal on the lysosomal acid hydrolases (1Kornfeld S. FASEB J. 1987; 1: 462-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). These lysosomal enzymes can then bind to one of the two mannose 6-phosphate receptors in the trans-Golgi network (TGN) and be transferred to endosomes and subsequently to lysosomes (2Kornfeld S. Mellman I. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1989; 5: 483-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (1235) Google Scholar, 3Dahms N.M. Lobel P. Kornfeld S. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 12115-12118Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The phosphodiester α-GlcNAcase plays an important role in lysosomal enzyme targeting because the mannose 6-phosphate receptors do not bind GlcNAc-P-Man. We have studied the kinetics, substrate specificity, and hydrodynamic properties of phosphodiester α-GlcNAcase from bovine liver (4Mullis K.G. Huynh M. Kornfeld R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1718-1726Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 5Mullis K.G. Kornfeld R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1727-1733Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and recently purified it over 600,000-fold to homogeneity using a two-step immunoaffinity purification procedure (6Kornfeld R. Bao M. Brewer K. Noll C. Canfield W.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23203-23210Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The native membrane-associated enzyme exists as a tetramer (272 kDa) composed of two dimers (136 kDa) each containing a pair of disulfide-linked monomers (68 kDa). The monomers are N-glycosylated with complex type oligosaccharides, and their mobility on reducing SDS-PAGE changes to about 50 kDa after digestion with peptideN-glycosidase F. Interestingly, this presumably cis-Golgi-acting enzyme is sialylated to a significant extent (3.8 mol/mol of monomer) indicating that it must travel to the trans-Golgi network where sialyltransferase resides. In this study we describe the cloning and expression of the cDNA encoding human phosphodiester α-GlcNAcase and the evidence that there are two splice forms of the mRNA for the enzyme. In contrast to glycosyltransferases and other glycoprotein-processing enzymes in the Golgi apparatus, which to date are all type II membrane-spanning proteins (7Colley K.J. Glycobiology. 1997; 7: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar), the phosphodiester α-GlcNAcase is composed of identical type I membrane-spanning subunits. The enzymes were obtained from the following suppliers: Taq DNA polymerase, EcoRI, andHindIII from Promega; BamHI from New England Biolabs; and T4 DNA ligase from Life Technologies, Inc. Transformation-competent DH5α cells were from Life Technologies, Inc. The protease inhibitor mixture (1000×) was prepared by combining antipain, chymostatin, leupeptin, and pepstatin A, all from Sigma, at 1 mg/ml each. Bovine phosphodiester α-GlcNAcase was purified and subjected to amino-terminal sequencing by Edman degradation as described previously (6Kornfeld R. Bao M. Brewer K. Noll C. Canfield W.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23203-23210Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). In addition, to obtain internal peptide sequence, the pure enzyme was subjected to trypsin digestion in solution, and the digest was fractionated by reverse phase microbore high pressure liquid chromatography. A number of peptides were obtained, and two peptides yielded single, unique amino acid sequences. The amino acid sequences of the three bovine phosphodiester α-GlcNAcase peptides were used to BLAST search the non-redundant GenBankTM EST data base (8Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (70513) Google Scholar), and four clones were found that had sequence homologous to tryptic peptide 3 (see TableI) at their 5′ ends. These EST clones from the I.M.A.G.E. Consortium (9Lennon G.G. Auffray C. Polymeropoulos M. Soares M.B.

Sequencing of the four cDNAs using the ABI Prism Dye Terminator Cycle Sequencing Ready Reaction mixture (Perkin-Elmer) showed that all three human clones were identical except for small variations in length at the 3′ and 5′ ends. The sequence of the mouse embryo clone was homologous to the human infant brain clones except that it contained a 102-base pair insert not present in the latter clones.Table IAmino acid sequences of peptides derived from bovine phosphodiester α-GlcNAcasePeptideSequence1 Amino-terminalDCTRVHAGRLEHESWPPAAQTAGAHRPSVRTFV2 TrypticRDGTLVTGYLSEEEVLDTEN3 TrypticGINLWEMAEFLLK Open table in a new tab The plasmid DNA of the human infant brain clone (I.M.A.G.E. ID 43150) which had an insert of about 1.4 kb was digested withHindIII to liberate a 700-bp fragment from its extreme 5′ end. The DNA fragment was gel-purified, and 50 ng were labeled with 100 μCi of [α-32P]dCTP using the High Prime DNA labeling kit from Roche Molecular Biochemicals according to the manufacturer's instructions. The labeled probe was used to screen a human liver 5′-Stretch plus cDNA library (CLONTECH HL 5022t) in the λ TriplEx-phagemid vector. Eight strongly positive colonies were detected in the primary screen of 106plaque-forming units carried out as described by the manufacturer. In the secondary screen of these 8, strongly positive colonies were seen on 7 plates, and a number of separate colonies from each positive plate were cloned. The λ clones were converted to pTriplEx plasmids making use of the Cre-Lox recombinase feature of the vector in the host cellsEscherichia coli BM 258, supplied byCLONTECH. The plasmid DNAs were subjected to restriction digestion to excise the cloned inserts. The inserts that also contained sequences of the EST varied in size from 1000 to 2200 bp. Clone 6.5, an example of the largest, was taken for the rest of the analysis. The BamHI-HindIII fragment of clone 6.5, gel-purified and labeled with [α-32P]dCTP as above, was used to probe a human multiple tissue Northern blot (CLONTECH) using the Express Hyb and protocol supplied by the manufacturer. A mouse genomic PI clone that was positive when probed with a32P-labeled fragment of clone 6.5 cDNA was obtained from Genome Systems Inc. The clone was sequenced by standard methods in the Molecular Biology Resource Facility of the W. K. Warren Medical Research Institute. Since clone 6.5 was lacking an initiator methionine and 5′-untranslated region but did contain a predicted signal sequence, PCR was used to generate a 5′-terminal fragment of clone 6.5 with a start codon. The 5′ sense primer contained 14 bp of unmatched sequence encoding an EcoRI site, a Kozak consensus sequence (10Kozak M. Cell. 1986; 44: 283-292Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3586) Google Scholar), and the Met codon, followed by the first 17 bp of the clone 6.5 sequence, and was 5′-GGAATTCCACCATGGCGACCTCCACGGGTCG-3′. The 3′-antisense primer corresponded to nucleotides 520–538 downstream of a BamHI site at nucleotide 512 (in the full-length sequence shown in Fig. 1) and was 5′-TGACCAGGGTCCCGTCGCG-3′. The PCR was performed withTaq polymerase in PCR buffer containing 1.3 mbetaine and 1% Me2SO using clone 6.5 DNA as template for 25 cycles at an annealing temperature of 45 °C. The PCR product of approximately 500 bp was gel-purified using the QIAquick Gel Extraction Kit (Qiagen, Inc.) and digested with EcoRI andBamHI to generate a fragment, also gel-purified, for ligation into the expression vector pcDNA3.1(−) obtained from Invitrogen. The vector was also digested with EcoRI andBamHI to provide an acceptor site in its multiple cloning site, and after gel purification it was treated with calf intestine alkaline phosphatase (New England Biolabs) and subjected to gel purification. The ligation was performed with T4 DNA ligase, and the reaction mixture was used to transform DH5α-competent cells that yielded many well separated ampicillin-resistant colonies of which 10 were cloned and all showed a 520-bp insert afterEcoRI/BamHI digestion. Four of the clones were sequenced using sense and antisense primers in the pcDNA3.1(−) vector. All four were identical both to each other and to clone 6.5 except for the added EcoRI-Kozak-ATG sequence, which was intact and in-frame with the first codon of clone 6.5. By similar procedures, the BamHI/HindIII fragment of clone 6.5 was ligated into this newly constructed expression vector between the BamHI site and the downstream HindIII site in the multiple cloning site. A number of clones were isolated, and all contained an EcoRI/HindIII insert of approximately 1600 bp as expected. Mutations were inserted in the human phosphodiester α-GlcNAcase expression clone by constructing mutants in the parental clone 6.5 in TriplEx between the BamHI andHindIII sites, verifying the mutation via sequencing and then performing a restriction digest followed by insertion of the purified mutant BamHI-HindIII fragment into the new expression vector. A deletion variant missing the 102-base pair insert not found in the human brain EST was constructed using the gene splicing by overlap extension (SOEing) method of Horton (11Horton R.M. Methods Mol. Biol. 1977; 67: 141-149Google Scholar). In the case of human phosphodiester α-GlcNAcase, “gene 1” is clone 6.5 from slightly before the BamHI site through nucleotide 1174, and “gene 2” is from nucleotide 1277 to slightly past theHindIII site. The sense primer a for gene 1 was 5′-GCTGCAGAACGCGCAGTTCG-3′, and the antisense primer b, which overlapped for 18 residues the sense primer c for gene 2, was (5′ to 3′) GGTTGACGTCACTTCATTTCGTCACAGAGGTCG. For gene 2 the sense primer c was 5′-TAAAGCAGTGTCTCCAGC-3′, and the antisense primer d (5′ to 3′) was GAGGACACCCAGATGGTC. Two PCR reactions were run using clone 6.5 as template. The products AB and CD were gel-purified, and these overlapping double-stranded fragments were used as the template for another PCR reaction primed with primer a and primer d to make product AD containing the 102-bp deletion. Following digestion withBamHI and HindIII the Δ102-bp variant was inserted into the expression vector pcDNA 3.1(−) as above. A mutant truncated just 5′ of the transmembrane domain (W450stop) was constructed using the Quik ChangeTM Site-directed Mutagenesis kit of Stratagene and a pair of priming nucleotides encompassing the desired W450stop:sense strand primer CCAGGACCGCCTGACTAGCCCTCACCCTGGCG and antisense strand primer (5′-3′) CGCCAGGGTGAGGGCTAGTCAGGCGGTCCTGG. COS cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (37 °C, 5% CO2) in 60-mm plates until they reached 50–80% confluence. The plates were then washed with serum-free Opti-MEM I and transfected with 2 μg of plasmid DNA per plate using the LipofectAMINE Plus reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.) and the protocol provided by the manufacturer. After 3 h the plates were supplemented with additional Opti-MEM I and fetal calf serum to bring the volume to 3 ml and 10% fetal calf serum. At 24 h the medium was changed to fresh Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 10% fetal calf serum, or in the case where the medium was to be sampled, to fresh Opti-MEM I with no serum. Cells and medium were harvested after an additional 24 h in the latter case, but cells in serum were harvested after another 48 h. The cells were scraped up and washed twice in Tris-buffered saline, resuspended in 500 μl of 10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, containing a protease inhibitor mixture (1 μg/ml), and subjected to two 10-s bursts on a Fisher sonicator. The sonicates were centrifuged in the Beckman Optima TL tabletop ultracentrifuge at 70,000 rpm for 30 min. The supernatant was removed and saved, and the membrane pellet was resuspended in 50 mmTris, pH 7.4, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mmCaCl2, 1.5% Lubrol and sonicated as above and centrifuged in the Hermle Z323K at 17,000 rpm (30,000 × g) for 5 min. The supernatant fraction contained the solubilized membranes. When the medium was sampled, it (3 ml) was removed from the plate and added to a tube containing protease inhibitors before the cells were worked up. The medium was then concentrated in a Centricon 30 apparatus before assay. All the fractions were assayed for phosphodiester α-GlcNAc activity and protein content. Enzyme assays and synthesis of [3H]GlcNAc-phosphomannose-α-methyl were performed as described previously (12Mullis K.G. Ketchum C.M. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 205: 200-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), except the concentration of [3H]GlcNAc-phosphomannose-α-methyl was reduced to 0.5 mm. One unit is defined as cleavage of 1 nmol of substrate per h at 37 °C. Protein concentration was measured using the Micro BCA assay (Pierce) standardized with bovine serum albumin (13Smith P.K. Krohn R.I. Hermanson G.T. Mallia A.K. Gartner F.H. Provenzano M.D. Fujimoto E.K. Goeke N.M. Olson B.J. Klenk D.C. Anal. Biochem. 1985; 150: 76-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (18615) Google Scholar). Samples were subjected to reducing SDS-PAGE in 7.5% gels in Tris glycine buffer and transferred to nitrocellulose. The blots were probed with affinity purified rabbit anti-peptide antibody (1:1200 dilution) (6Kornfeld R. Bao M. Brewer K. Noll C. Canfield W.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23203-23210Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) and detected with goat anti-rabbit IgG (Pierce) (1:5000 dilution) and ECL reagents (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The intensity of the bands on the Western blot was quantitated by laser densitometry using the Molecular Dynamics Personal Densitometer ImageQuant system. Affinity purified, homogeneous bovine phosphodiester α-GlcNAcase was subjected to amino-terminal amino acid sequencing as described previously (6Kornfeld R. Bao M. Brewer K. Noll C. Canfield W.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23203-23210Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The pure enzyme was also subjected to trypsin digestion and high pressure liquid chromatography to generate two internal tryptic peptides which were sequenced. The amino acid sequences of these three peptides are shown in TableI. The protein, nucleotide, and EST data bases were searched for sequences that matched these peptide sequences, and several human and mouse ESTs were found that had the sequence of peptide 3 at their amino termini. Three human infant brain EST clones and one mouse embryo clone were obtained from ATCC and sequenced by us. The three human clones were all identical except for total length at their 3′ ends and virtually identical to the mouse clone, except that the mouse EST contained a 102-bp region that was absent from all three human brain ESTs. An EcoRI-HindIII fragment of about 700 bp was excised from the human cDNA clone (ATCC 367524) and used to probe a human liver cDNA library directionally cloned in λ TriplEx vector (CLONTECH). Of the positive clones isolated from the library and converted to plasmids (pTriplEx), the largest (2200 bp) was represented by clone 6.5 which was used for the rest of the analysis. The nucleotide sequence of clone 6.5 cDNA encoding phosphodiester α-GlcNAcase and the corresponding deduced amino acid sequence are shown in Fig. 1 which also shows, in italics, the 5′-untranslated sequence and Met encoding ATG derived from the recently deposited human genomic DNA sequence. The cDNA clone has been completely sequenced on both strands and is a novel sequence that predicts a mature protein of about 50 kDa which is in agreement with the size of the deglycosylated mature bovine liver phosphodiester α-GlcNAcase. There is a uniqueBamHI site at base 512 and a unique HindIII site at base 1581. The schematic diagram of the amino acid sequence and the Kyte-Doolittle hydrophilicity plot shown in Fig.2 highlight some of the features of the phosphodiester α-GlcNAcase structure. All three bovine peptide sequences (1, 2, and 3) were found. Although the sequences of peptides 2 and 3 in the human are 100% identical to the bovine sequences, the amino-terminal peptide in human is only 67% identical to the bovine sequence. The human liver clone contains the 102-base pair insert that has the characteristics of an alternatively spliced segment that was missing in the human brain EST. The hydrophilicity plot indicates the presence of a hydrophobic membrane-spanning region from amino acids 448 to 474 and another hydrophobic region from amino acid 8 to 26 which fits the motif for a signal sequence, and there is a likely signal sequence cleavage site between Gly-25 and Leu-26 (14Nielsen H. Engelbrecht J. Brunck S. von Heijne G. Protein Eng. 1997; 10: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (4929) Google Scholar). There are six Asn-X-Ser/Thr potential N-linked glycosylation sites, one of which is within the 102-bp insert. All of these sites are amino-terminal of the putative trans-membrane region. These features indicate that the phosphodiester α-GlcNAcase is a type I membrane-spanning glycoprotein with the amino terminus in the lumen of the Golgi and the carboxyl terminus in the cytosol. This orientation is different from that of other glycosyltransferases and glycosidases involved in glycoprotein processing, which to date have been shown to be type II membrane-spanning proteins (7Colley K.J. Glycobiology. 1997; 7: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). Interestingly, there is a potential tyrosine-based internalization signal (Y488HPL491) in the cytoplasmic tail of the phosphodiester α-GlcNAcase sequence that suggests that the enzyme may travel to the TGN (where it becomes sialylated) or even to the plasma membrane before being retrieved to its site of action in the cis/medial-Golgi. A second potential retrieval signal in the phosphodiester α-GlcNAcase sequence is the carboxyl-terminal NPFKD. In yeast the sequence NPFXD has been shown to act as an endocytosis signal (15Tan P.K. Howard J.P. Payne G.S. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1789-1800Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), and more recently (16Salcini A.E. Confalonieri S. Doria M. Santolini E. Tassi E. Minenkova O.

The cDNA of clone 6.5 shown is missing the initiation codon and 5′-untranslated region. The human cDNA clone 6.5 is about 2.2 kb in size, and a fragment of it was labeled with32P and used to probe a human multiple tissue Northern blot (CLONTECH) as shown in Fig.3. An mRNA of approximately 2.4 kb was detected for all tissues except brain where the band was somewhat smaller (2.3 kb), consistent with the fact that the ESTs isolated from human brain are missing a 102-bp segment present in the human liver cDNA of clone 6.5. In addition, another fainter mRNA band at about 3.5 kb is present in the liver. A mouse genomic Pl clone was obtained that was positive when probed with 32P-labeled DNA fragments of the human clone 6.5 cDNA. Sequencing of this Pl clone revealed the intron/exon organization of most of the mouse gene, which is presented schematically in Fig. 4. The intron/exon borders were identified, and they are presented in TableII. The Pl clone was 9.8 kb in length and contained a large intron at the 5′ end followed by what is designated as exon 2 which encodes the mouse equivalent of amino acids 30–179 in the human phosphodiester α-GlcNAcase. Thus this genomic Pl clone is missing at least one 5′ exon that encodes the first 29 amino acids or more. The 102-base pair insert that is missing from the human brain ESTs exactly comprises exon 8, indicating that those mRNAs are the result of alternative splicing. Exon 10 encodes the trans-membrane domain and the cytoplasmic tail through the stop codon, followed by a 3′-untranslated region of at least 535 bp which occurs at the 3′ end of the Pl clone. While this manuscript was in preparation, a routine search of the non-redundant data base with the human cDNA sequence revealed that a recently deposited 160 kb of human genomic sequence (AC007011 from Los Alamos Laboratory) contained a 10-kb segment corresponding to the genomic sequence of the human phosphodiester α-GlcNAcase. The intron/exon organization of the human gene is presented schematically in Fig. 4 for comparison to the mouse gene. Similarly, the intron/exon borders are also presented in Table II. The exon sizes are the same for mouse and human, and the human exon 1 (missing in the mouse genomic clone) encodes the 5′-untranslated region and the initiator methionine which are absent in the human cDNA clone. The methionine is followed by the alanine which is the first amino acid encoded by the cDNA clone. Fig.5 shows a comparison of the mouse phosphodiester α-GlcNAcase amino acid sequence to that of the human sequence. The two sequences are 80% identical overall as shown in theboxed areas. The identity in the 41 amino acids of the cytosolic tail is less (73%), but the tetrapeptide potential internalization signal YHPL is completely conserved as is the COOH-terminal pentapeptide NPFKD, suggesting it may play a role in the trafficking of phosphodiester α-GlcNAcase.Table IISequences at intron-exon splice junctions of human and mouse phosphodiester α-GlcNAcase genesDonorAcceptorIntron sizeExon sizeNumberskbbpHuman861TCGGG gt gagtg. .. .cccga ag GGCCT0.104562ACCGG gt gagga. .. .gatcc ag GTACC1.491403GACAG gt tggat. .. .ccttc ag GTTCC1.251094CGTGG gt gagtc. .. .gccgc ag CATCA1.381295CACTG gt aagca. .. .tctac ag CCAGG0.692066GGAGA gt gagtg. .. .tcggc ag CCGGC0.09487TGAAG gt aggag. .. .tccat ag AGTGT0.471028CAGAG gt accta. .. .gttac ag TAAAG0.08649ACCAG gt aggtg. .. .tctgc ag GACCG1.4584010208to stopMouse. .cctgc ag GGTGT>1.324742ACCGG gt gagga. .. .cttcc ag GTCCT1.831403GACAG gt cagga. .. .ccttt ag GTTCT1.321094CGTGG gt gagtc. .. .tgcac ag CCTTA0.201295CACTG gt aagaa. .. .cccac ag CCAGG0.682066AGAGA gt gagtg. .. .ttggt ag CTGGC0.11487TGAAG gt gagag. .. .tccac ag AGTGT0.751028CCAAG gt atgcg. .. .cttgc ag TGAGG0.09649ACCAG gt aagtg. .. .atctc ag GACCA1.4873610208to stopExon sequences are shown in uppercase letters and introns in lowercase letters.

The size of introns and exons are given in kilobases or base pairs. As noted above, we have been unsuccessful in obtaining a full-length cDNA encoding the 5′-untranslated region and initiator methionine of human phosphodiester α-GlcNAcase despite trying a number of strategies to extend clone 6.5 to the 5′ end. Similarly the mouse Pl clone is missing the 5′ end of the mouse gene. However, since clone 6.5 encoded a very good signal sequence and signal peptide cleavage site, we reasoned that it may be missing only a few amino acids including an initiator methionine. Accordingly we constructed a modified 5′ end on clone 6.5 by adding an EcoRI site, a Kozak consensus sequence, and ATG to encode methionine in frame just before the first nucleotide of clone 6.5 and inserted the construct into the expression vector pcDNA3.1(−) (Invitrogen) as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Given the sequence we know from the human genomic DNA, it is now evident that our construct, in fact, encodes the entire phosphodiester α-GlcNAcase sequence for expression. A deletion mutant of clone 6.5 missing the 102-bp insert (Δ102-bp variant) was also constructed and put into pcDNA3.1(−). When these expression plasmids were transfected into COS cells and the cells were harvested 48 h after replacing the transfecting DNA with full medium, the results shown in Table III were obtained. Duplicate plates of cells expressing the full-length and the Δ102-bp variant as well as mock-transfected cells were lysed by sonication and subjected to high speed centrifugation to sediment a membrane pellet that was separated from the supernatant cytosol. The membranes were solubilized in detergent, and both fractions were assayed for phosphodiester α-GlcNAcase activity. Between 70 and 75% of the enzyme activity in the transfected cells was in the membrane pellet, and 78% of the endogenous COS cell phosphodiester α-GlcNAcase was in the membrane pellet. Table III shows that the solubilized membranes of COS cells have a level of endogenous phosphodiester α-GlcNAcase activity (21.5 nmol/h/mg protein) that is 4 times higher than that of bovine liver memb"

Kinetic analysis demonstrated that the substrates ATP, biotin, and the biotin-accepting protein bind in an ordered manner in the reaction mechanism. Treatment with any of three proteases of differing specificity in vitro revealed that the sequence between residues 240 and 260 was extremely sensitive to proteolysis, suggesting that it forms an exposed linker between an N-terminal 27-kDa domain and the C-terminal 50-kDa domain containing the active site. The protease susceptibility of this linker region was considerably reduced in the presence of ATP and biotin. A second protease-sensitive sequence, located in the presumptive catalytic site, was protected against digestion by the substrates. Expression of N-terminally truncated variants of the yeast enzyme failed to complement E. colistrains defective in biotin protein ligase activity. In vitro assays performed with purified N-terminally truncated enzyme revealed that removal of the N-terminal domain reduced BPL activity by greater than 3500-fold.

Additionally, those residues shown to contact biotin in the BirA crystal structure are invariant (15Leon-Del-Rio A. Leclerc D. Akerman B. Wakamatsu N. Gravel R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4626-4630Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 16Tissot G. Douce R. Alban C. Biochem. J. 1997; 323: 179-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 18Cronan J.E.J. Wallace J.C. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1995; 130: 221-229Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Consistent with biotin metabolism in the different organisms, none of the eukaryotic proteins contains sequences that suggest any DNA binding activity.While the large additional N-terminal domain present in both the human and yeast BPL proteins shows some sequence similarity between the two species (18Cronan J.E.J. Wallace J.C. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1995; 130: 221-229Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), little is known of the function of this region of the eukaryotic enzyme. Evidence for the functional importance of this domain comes from the identification of mutations in human BPL responsible for inherited metabolic disease, multiple carboxylase deficiency. Of the known lesions giving rise to this neonatal onset disorder, several point mutations alter residues in the vicinity of the presumptive biotin binding site and give rise to a decreased affinity for biotin (22Dupuis L. Leondelrio A. Leclerc D. Campeau E. Sweetman L. Saudubray J.M. Herman G. Gibson K.M. Gravel R.A. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1996; 5: 1011-1016Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 23Aoki Y. Suzuki Y. Li X. Sakamoto O. Chikaoka H. Takita S. Narisawa K. Pediatr. Res. 1997; 42: 849-854Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). However, other mutations, also responsive to biotin in vivo, occur in the N-terminal domain (residues 215–240), some distance from the catalytic site (19Suzuki Y. Aoki Y. Ishida Y. Chiba Y. Iwamatsu A. Kishino T. Niikawa N. Matsubara Y. Narisawa K. Nat. Genet. 1994; 8: 122-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 22Dupuis L. Leondelrio A. Leclerc D. Campeau E. Sweetman L.

Pediatr. Res. 1997; 42: 849-854Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The loss of BPL activity is apparently not due to either decreased affinity for biotin or biotin-mediated stability (23Aoki Y. Suzuki Y. Li X. Sakamoto O. Chikaoka H. Takita S. Narisawa K. Pediatr. Res. 1997; 42: 849-854Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), and it is not clear why the defect responds to biotin therapy. Currently, no comprehensive structural or functional data are available for the N-terminal region of eukaryotic BPL.Here we report the recombinant expression in E. coli of active yeast BPL (yBPL) with a C-terminal hexahistidine tag. Limited proteolysis of the purified enzyme has confirmed predictions of the domain structure based on sequence homology. Expression of N-terminally truncated proteins indicated that the presence of both domains was necessary for catalytic function.DISCUSSIONLimited proteolysis of purified yBPL, undertaken to determine the domain structure of the protein, indicated that the protein contained two protease-sensitive regions, the more N-terminal of which lies between residues 240 and 260. The observation that all three proteases tested, as well as an endogenous E. coli protease, cut the protein within this sequence suggests that this region most probably forms an exposed linker sequence between a 27-kDa N-terminal domain and the remaining 50-kDa portion of the protein. The second protease-sensitive region we observed in yBPL occurred within the 50-kDa C-terminal region, which, based on sequence homologies, contains the catalytic center (18Cronan J.E.J. Wallace J.C. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1995; 130: 221-229Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In fact, both the trypsin and endoproteinase Glu-C-sensitive residues mapped in the putative ATP and biotin binding region of the catalytic domain, with the trypsin cleavage site within the proposed ATP binding motif, GRGRGG (18Cronan J.E.J. Wallace J.C. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1995; 130: 221-229Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These cleavage sites were protected from proteolysis and subsequent loss of yBPL activity in the presence of ATP and biotin (Figs. 5 and 6). Correspondingly, the ligand-bound form of yBPL was more resistant to the loss of enzyme activity that accompanied proteolysis than apoenzyme. These observations strongly support the identification of the catalytic site made from sequence homologies. In the crystal structure of the BirA, the region containing the ATP binding motif is one of several poorly defined, solvent-exposed loops found close to the catalytic center (5Wilson K.P. Shewchuk L.M. Brennan R.G. Otsuka A.J. Matthews B.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 9257-9261Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). A subtilisin-sensitive site lies within an unstructured loop adjacent to the ATP binding loop, and cleavage is inhibited when either biotin or biotinyl-5′-AMP is bound to the enzyme (37Xu Y. Nenortas E. Beckett D. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 16624-16631Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). We conclude that the results of limited proteolysis presented here indicate that yBPL forms two domains and that the cleavage observed around the ATP binding motif suggests the presence of an exposed loop structure within the 50-kDa C-terminal domain, as is seen in BirA.In addition, and somewhat surprisingly, the presence of ATP and biotin also reduced protease susceptibility within the proposed linker sequence between the two domains. This suggests that substrate binding caused a global conformational change, affecting sequences at some distance from the binding site in the primary structure. Conformational changes in BirA associated with substrate binding have also been demonstrated (4Beckett D. Matthews B.W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 279: 362-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the N-terminal domain of BirA that is involved in DNA binding appears to affect the affinity of the catalytic domain for both biotin and biotinyl-5′-AMP. A truncation mutant in which the N-terminal domain was absent was still able to catalyze biotin transfer but displayed a 100-fold decrease in the affinity for biotin and a 1000-fold decrease in the affinity for biotinyl-5′-AMP (36Xu Y. Beckett D. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 1783-1792Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Biotin binding to this truncation caused no quenching of intrinsic protein fluorescence, as opposed to the 15% quenching observed with the intact enzyme (36Xu Y. Beckett D. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 1783-1792Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). These data suggest that quenching of fluorescence may be the result of the conformational changes that are induced by biotin binding and that the truncated enzyme is compromised in its ability to go through these changes. The interaction between the DNA binding domain and the catalytic domain is accompanied by conformational changes and is thought to relate to repressor function of BirA (5Wilson K.P. Shewchuk L.M. Brennan R.G. Otsuka A.J. Matthews B.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 9257-9261Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). Our data indicate that although the N-terminal domain in yBPL has no equivalent DNA binding function, there is a functional interaction with the catalytic domain.Furthermore, expression of N-terminally truncated variants of yBPL in two E. coli strains carrying birA mutations showed that the presence of both domains was necessary to produce a functional enzyme. Our analysis of the activity of the yBPL truncationsin vitro is consistent with the results of the complementation assays, and it is evident that the 3500-fold reduction in activity seen upon the deletion of the N-terminal domain reduced the activity of yBPL to a level that is inadequate for viability. It is likely that in the absence of the N-terminal domain conformational changes associated with substrate binding, necessary for enzymatic activity, may occur at a slower rate than in the presence of the domain and therefore affect the overall activity of the protein. This agrees with the observation that tryptic cleavage of yBPL in the linker region produced a form of yBPL that retained some catalytic activity inin vitro assays (Fig. 6). While the precise role of the N-terminal domain is unclear, the results presented here are consistent with the studies of known defects in human BPL. Several point mutations in the N-terminal domain of human BPL result in a defective enzyme (19Suzuki Y. Aoki Y. Ishida Y. Chiba Y. Iwamatsu A. Kishino T. Niikawa N. Matsubara Y. Narisawa K. Nat. Genet. 1994; 8: 122-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar,22Dupuis L. Leondelrio A. Leclerc D. Campeau E. Sweetman L. Saudubray J.M. Herman G. Gibson K.M. Gravel R.A. Hum. Mol.

Res. 1997; 42: 849-854Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), indicating that the integrity of this region of the protein is important for function. Sequence homology between yeast and human BPL in the N-terminal domain is low and allows different alignments, making it difficult to precisely identify analogous residues and therefore to produce point mutations in yBPL that mimic those isolated in the defective human enzyme. However, these mutations in human BPL are found upstream of the protease-sensitive linker region in yBPL identified here (17Chapman-Smith A. Cronan J.E. J. Nutr. 1999; 129: 477-484Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), consistent with the inability of the N-terminal truncation yBPL(Δ1–233) to complement the birA defects. Structural characterization of the N-terminal domain and the identification of interactions with both the catalytic site and other molecules will aid in determining the role of this domain in enzyme function.While BPL has been purified from a variety of sources, the low abundance of the enzyme has made purification of the endogenous enzyme a difficult task. Since the availability of recombinant DNA technology has permitted high level production of proteins in suitable hosts with improved yields, protein overexpression has facilitated isolation of BirA (38Eisenberg M.A. Prakash O. Hsiung S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 239: 2858-2864Google Scholar, 39Buoncristiani M.R. Otsuka A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 1013-1016Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and Arabidopsis thaliana BPL from E. coli. Here we report recombinant expression in bacteria of a eukaryotic member of this enzyme family. Cloning a hexahistidine tag onto the C terminus of yBPL permitted the isolation of active enzyme in a rapid two-step purification, with yields comparable with those reported for recombinant production of the bacterial protein (38Eisenberg M.A. Prakash O. Hsiung S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 239: 2858-2864Google Scholar, 39Buoncristiani M.R. Otsuka A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 1013-1016Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Whereas partial purification of BPL from S. cerevisiae has been reported previously (40Sundaram T.K. Cazzulo J.J. Kornberg H.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1971; 143: 609-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), our system allowed purification to apparent homogeneity (Fig. 1).The results of our steady-state kinetic analysis of yBPL indicate that biotinylation occurs through a two-step Bi Uni Uni Bi ping-pong mechanism. In the first partial reaction, the enzyme complexes with ATP and biotin and catalyzes the synthesis of biotinyl-5′-AMP with subsequent release of pyrophosphate. The addition of the apo acceptor protein then follows in the second partial reaction with the release of the biotinylated protein and AMP. The kinetics of the formation of the adenylated intermediate has been quantitatively analyzed using BirA (41Xu Y. Beckett D. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 7354-7360Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The enzyme-biotinyl-5′-AMP complex is quite stable (41Xu Y. Beckett D. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 7354-7360Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) and is proposed to be the most abundant enzyme form in the cell. Here we demonstrate that the precursors of the intermediate, ATP and biotin, bind to yBPL in an ordered manner. As has been observed with plant BPL (20Tissot G. Pepin R. Job D. Douce R. Alban C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 258: 586-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), ATP binds to the yeast enzyme before biotin. This is in contrast to the reaction pathway catalyzed by bacterial BirA, where biotin is the first ligand to bind the enzyme (41Xu Y. Beckett D. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 7354-7360Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The order of substrate binding in E. coli is believed to allow more responsive regulation of biotin biosynthesis. When the cellular demand for biotin is low, the BirA-biotinyl-5′-AMP complex occupies the biooperator sequence and represses transcription of the biotin biosynthetic operon. As apoBCCP levels increase, biotin is transferred from the enzyme-bound adenylate to the protein-bound form, with concomitant derepression of the biotin operon. Kinetic analysis of the interaction of BirA with biotin and ATP indicates that formation of the repressor complex is highly sensitive to biotin, and theK m for ATP is in the low millimolar range (4Beckett D. Matthews B.W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 279: 362-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 29Chapman-Smith A. Morris T.W. Wallace J.C. Cronan Jr., J.E. J. Biol.

In contrast, BPLs from biotin auxotrophic species generally bind ATP at lower concentrations, with K m values in the range of 0.38–200 μm (42Siegel L. Foote J.L. Coon M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1965; 240: 1025-1031Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 43Murthy P.N.A. Mistry S.P. Can. J. Biochem. 1974; 52: 800-803Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 44Chiba Y. Suzuki Y.

Int. 1994; 34: 225-232PubMed Google Scholar). The value of 21 μm reported here for S. cerevisiae is well below the intracellular concentration of ATP (46Wallace P.G. Pedler S.M. Wallace J.C. Berry M.N. Anal. Biochem. 1994; 222: 404-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) and is consistent with the absence of repressor function in the eukaryotic BPLs.The formation of an activated enzyme-bound biotinyl intermediate in the first partial reaction of BPL requires a nucleotide triphosphate and a divalent metal ion (34Christner J.E. Schlesinger M. Coon M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1964; 239: 3997-4005Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). BPLs from different organisms differ in their specificity for both the NTP source and the divalent metal. For example, magnesium is the preferred metal ion for pea BPL (21Tissot G. Job D. Douce R. Alban C. Biochem. J. 1996; 314: 391-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), whereas zinc and manganese ions can readily substitute for magnesium ions for the P. shermanii enzyme (6Lane D.M. Young D.L. Lynen F. J. Biol. Chem. 1964; 239: 2858-2864Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7Shenoy B.C. Wood H.G. FASEB J. 1988; 2: 2396-2401Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). For the yeast enzyme, calcium or magnesium ions were the preferred divalent metals, with reasonable levels of activity also seen in the presence of nickel or manganese, while cobalt, zinc, and copper ions failed to support significant activity. Yeast BPL had an absolute requirement for ATP, since only minimal enzyme activity was detected when ATP was replaced by other nucleotide triphosphates. This is similar to BPLs fromP. shermanii, B. stearothermophilus, pig, and rabbit, which are also specific for ATP (7Shenoy B.C. Wood H.G. FASEB J. 1988; 2: 2396-2401Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 8Cazzulo J.J. Sundaram T.K. Dilks S.N. Kornberg H.L. Biochem.

J. Biochem. 1974; 52: 800-803Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 47Madappally M.M. Mistry S.P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1970; 215: 316-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), whereas CTP is the preferred nucleotide for both the pea (21Tissot G. Job D. Douce R. Alban C. Biochem. J. 1996; 314: 391-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) and bovine liver (44Chiba Y. Suzuki Y. Aoki Y. Ishida Y. Narisawa K. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1994; 313: 8-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) biotin ligases.Kinetic studies on BPLs have reported a wide range ofK m values for biotin, ranging from 4.7 nm for the rabbit liver enzyme (42Siegel L. Foote J.L. Coon M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1965; 240: 1025-1031Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) to 3.3 μmin chicken liver (43Murthy P.N.A. Mistry S.P. Can. J. Biochem. 1974; 52: 800-803Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Here we observed a low K m for biotin (67 nm) for yeast BPL. Bakers' yeast is auxotrophic for biotin, which is actively transported into the cell via the recently cloned H+-biotin symporter, VHT1 (48Stolz J. Hoja U. Meier S. Sauer N. Schweizer E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18741-18746Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). This membrane-bound transport protein displays maximal activity when cells are grown in media containing an extremely low concentration of biotin, 0.8 nm and is inhibited by greater than 8 nmbiotin (48Stolz J. Hoja U. Meier S. Sauer N. Schweizer E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18741-18746Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Rogers and Lichstein (49Rogers T.O. Lichstein H.C. J. Bacteriol. 1969; 100: 557-564Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) demonstrated that the cellular concentration of free biotin in yeast can be increased against a concentration gradient. Under conditions that give maximal growth, the free biotin pool can reach a concentration of 70 μm (49Rogers T.O. Lichstein H.C. J. Bacteriol. 1969; 100: 557-564Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which would be saturating for yBPL. The mechanism of transport inhibition is not understood, and the possibility that yBPL interacts with the receptor to regulate biotin metabolism in yeast is both speculative and interesting.An upper limit for the bimolecular rate constant for the formation of the enzyme-biotin complex can be determined using the values obtained in the kinetic analysis. The calculatedk cat/K m value for biotin of 6.0 ± 0.08 × 106m−1s−1 is several orders of magnitude smaller than that predicted for a diffusion-controlled process. This value is 3-fold smaller than that of BirA (50Xu Y. Beckett D. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 279: 405-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) but 10-fold larger than the value determined for A. thaliana BPL (20Tissot G. Pepin R. Job D. Douce R. Alban C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 258: 586-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), suggesting subtle structural differences in the active sites of these BPLs. yBPL was found to be highly specific for binding biotin, since several closely related biotin analogues and lipoic acid all failed to inhibit the incorporation of biotin even when present at a 100-fold excess over [3H]biotin. This substrate specificity is a common feature of BPLs from a variety of sources (6Lane D.M. Young D.L. Lynen F. J. Biol. Chem. 1964; 239: 2858-2864Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21Tissot G. Job D. Douce R. Alban C. Biochem. J. 1996; 314: 391-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 44Chiba Y.

This reaction results in the interchange of a carbonyl-CoA group and a hydrogen atom on vicinal carbons. The crystal structure of the enzyme reveals the presence of an aromatic cluster of residues in the active site that includes His-244, Tyr-243, and Tyr-89 in the large subunit. Of these, His-244 is within hydrogen bonding distance to the carbonyl oxygen of the carbonyl-CoA moiety of the substrate. The location of these aromatic residues suggests a possible role for them in catalysis either in radical stabilization and/or by direct participation in one or more steps in the reaction. The mechanism by which the initially formed substrate radical isomerizes to the product radical during the rearrangement of methylmalonyl-CoA to succinyl-CoA is unknown. Ab initio molecular orbital theory calculations predict that partial proton transfer can contribute significantly to the lowering of the barrier for the rearrangement reaction. In this study, we report the kinetic characterization of the H244G mutant, which results in an acute sensitivity of the enzyme to oxygen, indicating the important role of this residue in radical stabilization. Mutation of His-244 leads to an ∼300-fold lowering in the catalytic efficiency of the enzyme and loss of one of the two titratable pK a values that govern the activity of the wild type enzyme. These data suggest that protonation of His-244 increases the reaction rate in wild type enzyme and provides experimental support for ab initio molecular orbital theory calculations that predict rate enhancement of the rearrangement reaction by the interaction of the migrating group with a general acid.

Biochem. 1997; 66: 269-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). The role of the B12cofactor or adenosylcobalamin (AdoCbl)1 is to function as a free radical reservoir responsible for the controlled generation of a substrate radical at the initiation of the reaction cycle (3Halpern J. Science. 1985; 227: 869-875Crossref PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar). The first common step in AdoCbl-dependent reactions is the homolytic cleavage of the cobalt-carbon bond to generate a radical pair (Scheme I). Stopped-flow kinetic studies indicate that the homolysis reaction is coupled to the subsequent step, in which a hydrogen atom is abstracted from the methyl group of the substrate to generate a substrate-centered radical (4Padmakumar R. Padmakumar R. Banerjee R. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 3713-3718Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar).

Ab initiomolecular orbital calculations predict that full or partial protonation of the substrate radical can facilitate the rearrangement reaction (12George P. Glusker J.P. Bock C.W. J. Am. Chem.

Since the conjugate acid of the thioester carbonyl oxygen has a pK a of ∼−6 (19Edward J.T. Wong S.C. Welch G. Can. J. Chem. 1978; 59: 931-940Crossref Google Scholar), this precludes complete protonation of the carbonyl oxygen of methylmalonyl-CoA by any active-site residue. However, recent high level ab initiomolecular orbital theory-based calculations predict that even partial proton transfer can contribute substantially to lowering the transition state barrier for the putative cyclopropyloxy radical (18Smith D.M. Golding B.T. Radom L. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1999; 121: 1383-1384Crossref Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The crystal structure of methylmalonyl-CoA mutase has been solved recently (20Mancia F. Keep N.H.

Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 7999-8005Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). It reveals a buried active site in the α subunit, which opens to the surface via a long tunnel that is plugged by the CoA tail of the substrate. The carbonyl group of the substrate is in hydrogen-bonding distance to an active-site residue, His-244 (SchemeIII), which is involved in a hydrogen-bonding network that includes the carboxylate of the substrate as well as Arg-207 (23Ludwig M. Evans P.R. Banerjee R. Chemistry and Biochemistry of B12. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1999Google Scholar). His-244 is thus well positioned to function as a general acid that could promote the rearrangement reaction by hydrogen bonding to the carbonyl-CoA group in the ground state and/or in the transition state. Mutation of the aromatic residue Tyr-89 to phenylalanine results in altered energetics with respect to the wild type enzyme, which is consistent with an increase in the barrier to interconversion between the substrate and product radicals (24Thomä N.H. Meier T.W. Evans P.R. Leadlay P.F. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 14386-14393Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). To test the hypothesis that His-244 facilitates the rearrangement reaction by serving as a general acid, we have employed site-directed mutagenesis. Mutation of this residue to glycine results in an acute sensitivity of the mutase-catalyzed reaction to oxygen, in contrast to the relative stability of the wild type enzyme to oxygen, and results from quenching of the radical intermediates. The catalytic efficiency of the H244G mutant is ∼300-fold lower than that of the wild type enzyme under anaerobic conditions. The pH dependence of the wild type and mutant enzymes under maximal velocity conditions are distinct and suggests that one of the two kinetic pK a values associated with the wild type reaction is due to His-244. Our data provide experimental support for a modest rate enhancement of the rearrangement reaction by His-244, in contrast to the large effects predicted by the ab initio molecular orbital theory calculations, and reveal the importance of the aromatic cluster residue, His-244, in radical shielding. Methylmalonyl-CoA and DEPC were purchased from Sigma. Thiokinase was purchased from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. Radioactive [14C]CH3-malonyl-CoA (56.4 Ci/mole) was purchased from New England Nuclear. The following primers were employed for the polymerase chain reaction reactions. Sense mutagenic primer: TCCGGCTACG GCATGC AGGAAGCC; Antisense mutagenic primer: GGCTTCCT GCATGC CGTAGCCGGA. The codon specifying Gly-244 is italicized, and the newly created SphI restriction site is underlined. The sequences of the flanking sense and antisense primers containing MluI and PstI restriction sites, respectively, were as follows. Sense: GGCCCGTATGCAACCATGTACGCG; antisense: GTCGTGCCCGATTCCTGCTGCAGG. After the polymerase chain reaction, a 0.94-kilobase product was cloned into a TA cloning vector using the cloning kit from Invitrogen.MluI and partial PstI restriction digestion were employed to exchange the 0.94-kilobase fragment in the native expression vector, pMEX2 (25McKie N. Keep N.H. Patchett M.L. Leadlay P.F. Biochem. J. 1990; 269: 293-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) (provided by P. Leadlay at the University of Cambridge) with the corresponding fragment containing the H244G mutation. The presence of the mutation was confirmed by nucleotide sequence determination of both strands as well as by identification of a newly created SphI site. The H244G variant was expressed at levels that were comparable to that of the wild type enzyme and was purified using the same conditions described previously for the native enzyme (10Padmakumar R. Banerjee R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9295-9300Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Activity of the enzyme and the pH dependence of the reaction were determined in the fixed-time radiolabel assay at 37 °C as described previously (10Padmakumar R. Banerjee R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9295-9300Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). For the pH studies, the dependence of the reaction velocity was monitored at a fixed and saturating substrate concentration at different pH values. That the enzymes were operating under V max conditions was confirmed by Michaelis-Menten analysis of the substrate dependence of the reaction velocity at each pH, with substrate concentrations ranging from 0.5× to 10× K m. The pH profiles obtained from both data sets were comparable. Due to the acute lability of H244G to oxygen, the standard assay had to be modified to make measurements under anaerobic conditions. For this, all reagents were bubbled with N2 for 3 h before use. The enzyme solution was deoxygenated by gently blowing a stream of N2over its surface for 10 min at 4 °C. One unit of enzyme activity produces 1 μmol of succinyl-CoA/min at 37 °C. The sensitivity of H244G to alkylation by DEPC was measured under anaerobic assay conditions in the radiolabeled assay described above. The final concentration of DEPC was 200 μm, and 500 μm hydroxylamine was employed to reverse the reaction as described previously (26Padmakumar R. Taoka S. Padmakumar R. Banerjee R. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1995; 117: 7033-7034Crossref Scopus (103) Google Scholar). The stability of the bound cofactor was determined by irradiation of a 13 μm sample containing either wild type or H244G enzyme in 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, placed on ice. A 60-W lamp was placed 8 inches away from the enzyme sample. Photolysis of bound AdoCbl was monitored by recording spectra periodically between 300 and 700 nm. The aerobic photolysis product, OHCbl, is easily identified by its sharp absorption maximum at 350 nm. The mutation of His-244 to glycine does not adversely affect the expression level of the recombinant protein. Since the chromatographic behavior of the mutant was indistinguishable from that of wild type enzyme, it permitted its purification using the previously described protocol (10Padmakumar R. Banerjee R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9295-9300Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The purified enzyme had a specific activity of 0.44 units/mg of protein at 37 °C under V max conditions in the anaerobic assay. The thermal stabilities of the H244G mutant and wild type enzymes were compared by preincubation of the enzymes for varying lengths of time at 37 °C before their use in the standard assay and were found to be indistinguishable (data not shown). Although the rate constants associated with the individual steps of the reaction shown in Scheme I have not been determined, kinetic characterization of the wild type enzyme indicates that product inhibition may be rate-determining (4Padmakumar R. Padmakumar R. Banerjee R. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 3713-3718Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 24Thomä N.H. Meier T.W. Evans P.R. Leadlay P.F. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 14386-14393Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 27Meier T.W. Thomä N.H. Leadlay P.F. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 11791-11796Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Thus, under steady-state conditions, the spectrum of the enzyme is dominated by AdoCbl (4Padmakumar R. Padmakumar R. Banerjee R. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 3713-3718Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). In contrast, the addition of methylmalonyl-CoA to the holoenzyme form of H244G results in the rapid formation of OHCbl (Fig.1 A, spectrum 3). To determine whether the quenching of the cob(II)alamin intermediate to OHCbl occurred due to accessibility to oxygen or by an active-site water molecule that may reside in the cavity created by the missing imidazole side chain, the same experiment was repeated under anaerobic conditions. For this experiment, 19 μm enzyme was mixed with 14.4 mm (R,S)-methylmalonyl-CoA under anaerobic conditions, and the first spectrum was recorded 1.5 min after the addition of substrate. Under these conditions, the spectrum of the enzyme was obtained under steady-state turnover conditions and revealed the predominance of AdoCbl (Fig. 1 A, spectrum2). It is marked by a decrease in absorption across much of the spectral range. Similar spectral changes have been reported for the wild type mutase under equilibrium conditions (9Keep N.H. Smith G.A. Evans M.C.W. Diakun G.P. Leadlay P.F. Biochem. J. 1993; 295: 387-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). In addition, similar spectral changes were noted in the reverse direction, i.e.when H244G was mixed with succinyl-CoA under anaerobic conditions (data not shown). In contrast, the spectrum of wild type enzyme mixed with substrate is identical under aerobic and anaerobic conditions (Fig.1 B). Since the H244G mutant is significantly more labile to oxygen under steady-state turnover conditions, it was of interest to determine whether or not the mutation had altered the stability of AdoCbl in the ground state, i.e. in the absence of substrate. Both H244G and wild type enzyme stabilize bound AdoCbl against photolysis to the same extent. Thus, AdoCbl bound to both enzyme forms was resistant to photolysis during ∼3 h of irradiation using conditions described under “Experimental Procedures” (data not shown). Slow conversion to OHCbl was observed at longer times. Hence, the lability of the bound cofactor to oxidative escape after cleavage of the cobalt-carbon bond occurs only in the presence of substrate in H244G. Due to the oxygen lability of the H244G mutant, the steady-state kinetic parameters were determined under anaerobic conditions (TableI). The mutation increases theK m for methylmalonyl-CoA by a factor of ∼3. In contrast, the K m ,app for AdoCbl is unchanged (data not shown). The k cat for the mutant is ∼100-fold lower than for the wild type enzyme. Thus, the H244G variant has an ∼300-fold lower kinetic efficiency as compared with the wild type enzyme. The activity of the wild type enzyme measured under aerobic and anaerobic assay conditions is identical, indicating insensitivity to oxygen at least during the duration of the assay.Table IComparison of the kinetic properties of wild type and H244G methylmalonyl-CoA mutaseEnzymeK m M-CoA1-aM-CoA, methylmalonyl-CoA.k catk cat/K mWild type133 ± 37 μm113 s−18.5 × 105 m−1 s−1H244G1-bThese values were determined in the radiolabel assay at 37 °C under anaerobic conditions.350 ± 57 μm1.1 s−13 × 103 m−1 s−11-a M-CoA, methylmalonyl-CoA.1-b These values were determined in the radiolabel assay at 37 °C under anaerobic conditions. Open table in a new tab The pH dependences of the wild type and mutant enzymes underV max conditions are distinct (Fig.2). The wild type enzyme exhibits a bell-shaped pH dependence with pK a ,1app= 5.7 ± 0.1 and pK a ,2app = 8.4 ± 0.1, respectively, and a pH maximum of 7–7.5 (Fig.2 A). This is very similar to the pH dependence reported previously for the ovine mutase (28Cannata J.J.B. Focesi A.J. Mazumder R. Warner R.C. Ochoa S. J. Biol. Chem. 1965; 240: 3249-3257Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, a single kinetic pK a ,app (5.2 ± 0.1) controls the activity of the H244G mutant and is similar to pK a ,1app for the wild type enzyme (Fig.2 B). These data support the assignment of the second kinetic pK a in the wild type enzyme to ionization of His-244. Protonation of His-244 is therefore associated with higher mutase activity (Scheme III). The crystal structure of methylmalonyl-CoA mutase reveals the presence of two histidines in the active site: His-244 and His-610 (20Mancia F. Keep N.H. Nakagawa A. Leadlay P.F. McSweeney S. Rasmussen B. Bösecke P. Diat O. Evans P.R. Structure (Lond.). 1996; 4: 339-350Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar). The latter serves as the lower axial ligand to the cobalt. The activity of wild type enzyme is susceptible to the alkylating agent, DEPC (26Padmakumar R. Taoka S. Padmakumar R. Banerjee R. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1995; 117: 7033-7034Crossref Scopus (103) Google Scholar), and the inhibition is partially reversed by hydroxylamine, consistent with histidine ligation (29Miles E.W. Methods Enzymol. 1977; 47: 431-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (814) Google Scholar). To determine whether the sensitivity of the wild type enzyme results from alkylation at His-244, the effect of DEPC on the activity of H244G was examined (Table II). In contrast to the wild type enzyme, H244G is more resistant to 200 μm DEPC retaining ∼30% of its activity versus only 6% for wild type after preincubation of the enzyme with DEPC. The presence of the cofactor, AdoCbl, completely protects against inhibition in both wild type and mutant enzymes. Since the susceptibility of the second histidine mutant, H610A, to DEPC is similar to that of H244G, 2S. Chakraborty and R. Banerjee, unpublished results. these results indicate DEPC inhibition of wild type enzyme results from alkylation at both active-site histidine residues.Table IIComparison of DEPC inhibition of wild type and H244G methylmalonyl-CoA mutaseAssay conditionsRelative activityH244GWild type2-aThese values were from Ref. 26.Standard assay100100Apoenzyme pretreated with DEPC306Holoenzyme pretreated with DEPC100100Apoenzyme pretreated with DEPC + hydroxyamine6326Holoenzyme pretreated with DEPC + hydroxylamine100872-a These values were from Ref. 26Padmakumar R.

Open table in a new tab The carbon skeleton rearrangements catalyzed by a subgroup of AdoCbl-dependent enzymes represent chemically challenging reactions, and competing hypotheses have been advanced to explain the mechanism of this step (Scheme II). Of these, mechanisms involving carbocation (pathway a) or carbanion (pathway b) intermediates seem unlikely to be important since they would be accompanied by the reduction or oxidation, respectively, of the homolysis product, cob(II)alamin. The absorption spectra of cobalamins containing cobalt in the 3+, 2+, and 1+ oxidation states are distinct, and spectral changes indicative of oxidation state changes have not been observed during enzyme-monitored turnover in either methylmalonyl-CoA mutase (4Padmakumar R. Padmakumar R. Banerjee R. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 3713-3718Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar) or glutamate mutase (5Marsh E.N.G. Ballou D.P. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 11864-11872Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Based on the crystal structures of methylmalonyl-CoA mutase-containing substrate analogs, the pathway involving an organocobalt adduct (pathway e) appears to be precluded by the distance between the cobalt and the vicinal substrate carbon atoms at which the rearrangement reaction occurs (20Mancia F. Keep N.H. Nakagawa A. Leadlay P.F. McSweeney S. Rasmussen B. Bösecke P. Diat O. Evans P.R.

Structure (Lond.). 1998; 6: 711-720Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar,23Ludwig M. Evans P.R. Banerjee R. Chemistry and Biochemistry of B12. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1999Google Scholar). The dissociative mechanism (pathway d) predicts the generation of acrylate and a formyl-CoA radical as intermediates (11Beatrix B. Zelder O. Kroll F. Örlygsson G. Golding B.T. Buckel W. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 1995; 34: 2398-2401Crossref Scopus (65) Google Scholar). To account for the observed retentive substitution at both carbon centers (30Retey J. Dolphin D. B12. 2. John Wiley & Sons, New York1982: 357-380Google Scholar), rotation of the acrylate around the C1-C2 bond has to be invoked (11Beatrix B. Zelder O. Kroll F. Örlygsson G. Golding B.T. Buckel W. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 1995; 34: 2398-2401Crossref Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The driving force for this conformational rotation is not clear. Furthermore, formyl-CoA and acrylate inhibit methylmalonyl-CoA mutase with a very high K i, which is >100-fold larger than theK m for succinyl-CoA (31Abend A. Illich V. Retey J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 249: 180-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Recently ab initio calculations indicate that the fragmentation-reassociation pathway requires significantly greater energy (93.2 kJ mol−1 versus 46.9 kJ mol−1 for direct rearrangement (18Smith D.M. Golding B.T. Radom L. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1999; 121: 1383-1384Crossref Scopus (55) Google Scholar)). Thus, there are no compelling reasons at present to consider this mechanism for the methylmalonyl-CoA mutase-catalyzed reaction. Although there is insufficient evidence to rigorously dismiss the alternative pathways, the most likely mechanism for methylmalonyl-CoA mutase based on the available information, is direct rearrangement (Scheme II, pathway c). This intramolecular rearrangement reaction is estimated to have a barrier of 46.9 kJ mol−1(18Smith D.M. Golding B.T. Radom L. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1999; 121: 1383-1384Crossref Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Although complete protonation is predicted to lower the barrier to migration by 36.9 kJ/mol (2 → 3 versus 5 → 6 in Scheme I), an incremental lowering of this barrier is predicted by partial protonation of the carbonyl group with acids of intermediate strengths (18Smith D.M. Golding B.T. Radom L. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1999; 121: 1383-1384Crossref Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The crystal structure of methylmalonyl-CoA mutase indicates that His-244 in the large subunit is within hydrogen-bonding distance to the carbonyl oxygen of the carbonyl-CoA moiety (20Mancia F. Keep N.H. Nakagawa A. Leadlay P.F. McSweeney S. Rasmussen B. Bösecke P. Diat O. Evans P.R. Structure (Lond.). 1996; 4: 339-350Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar, 21Mancia F. Evans P. Structure (Lond.). 1998; 6: 711-720Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Its location is, thus, suggestive of a potential role in facilitation of the rearrangement reaction. The mutation of His-244 to glycine represents a nonconservative change, and the interpretation of the kinetic results presented here must therefore be treated with caution. However, a preliminary report on the mutation of His-244 to alanine indicates that replacement of the imidazole ring results in the occupancy of a water molecule between the bound substrate and the alanine in the crystal structure determined at a resolution of 2.8 Å (32Thomä N.H. Leadlay P.F. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1998; 26: 293-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The kinetic properties of the H244A and H244G mutants are similar, and they are both susceptible to oxidation under turnover conditions (32Thomä N.H. Leadlay P.F. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1998; 26: 293-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). This engenders confidence in the inference that the pH-dependent changes associated with the H244G mutation do not result from unwanted conformational changes elsewhere in the protein. One of the remarkable features of methylmalonyl-CoA mutase is that it catalyzes a reaction involving radical intermediates under aerobic conditions. This raises the question of how the enzyme shields the reactive organic and metallic radicals. His-244 is involved in a hydrogen-bonding interaction with the carbonyl group of the CoA moiety of the substrate. The addition of substrate to an aerobic solution of wild type holomethylmalonyl-CoA mutase rapidly leads to an equilibrium mixture of substrate and product in which succinyl-CoA is favored by a factor of 23 (33Kellermeyer R.W. Allen S.H.G. Stjernholm R. Wood H.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1964; 239: 2562-2569Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Under these conditions the spectrum of the enzyme resembles that of the starting enzyme but displays lower absorbance across the entire wavelength range (Fig. 1 B). In contrast, addition of substrate to H244G leads to the rapid appearance of OHCbl, an oxidation product of the intermediate, cob(II)alamin (Fig.1 A). This can be prevented by the exclusion of oxygen from the solution. The sensitivity of H244G to oxygen is mirrored by the difference in its activity under aerobic (specific activity = 0.02 units/mg) and anaerobic (specific activity = 0.44 units/mg) conditions. Thus in H244G, cob(II)alamin is intercepted by oxygen once every 22 turnovers under aerobic conditions. In contrast, the same specific activity is measured for the wild type enzyme whether or not oxygen is present in the assay mixture (data not shown). Hence, His-244 buried in the active site, as revealed by the static crystal structures (20Mancia F. Keep N.H. Nakagawa A. Leadlay P.F. McSweeney S. Rasmussen B. Bösecke P. Diat O. Evans P.R. Structure (Lond.). 1996; 4: 339-350Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar, 21Mancia F. Evans P. Structure (Lond.). 1998; 6: 711-720Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar, 22Mancia F. Smith G.A. Evans P.R. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 7999-8005Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar), nevertheless plays an important role in radical stabilization in the aerobic milieu that the enzyme operates in. The mutation does not, however, alter the susceptibility of AdoCbl to photolysis in the ground state. Thus, the photolysis products cob(II)alamin and the deoxyadenosyl radical show a strong propensity for recombination rather than oxidative escape, as is seen with the wild type enzyme. The spectrum of H244G under steady-state conditions reveals the predominance of the AdoCbl state of the enzyme (Fig. 1 A). Partitioning of tritium from AdoCbl to methylmalonyl-CoA and succinyl-CoA are consistent with an increase in the barrier for interconversion of the substrate and product radicals in the kinetically similar albeit conservative mutant, H244Q (32Thomä N.H. Leadlay P.F. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1998; 26: 293-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Since the rate constants for the individual steps in the mutase-catalyzed reaction are not known, it is difficult to predict a prioriwhether or not the H244G mutation should lead to enhanced accumulation of cob(II)alamin under steady-state conditions. The relative energies of the other intermediates along the pathway are unknown, and the steady-state composition of the enzyme will be governed by these and the height of the barriers separating the intermediates. The wild type enzyme shows a bell-shaped pH dependence with two kinetic pK a values (Fig. 2). Since the two pK a values are within three units of each other and a pH independent region is not observed, the measured pK a values represent estimates and are not likely to be precisely determined. The descending limb of the pH titration is lost when a single residue, His-244, is mutated. The estimated pK a for the mutant is similar to pk a ,1app for the wild type enzyme. These data support the assignment of the second pK a to His-244 in the wild type enzyme. Assuming that pk a ,2app represents the ionization of histidine, then protonation of His-244 is associated with higher mutase activity (Scheme III). A pK a of 8.4 is somewhat high for an imidazole, which is typically between 6 and 7. The proximity of His-244 to the carboxylate of the bound substrate, which is within hydrogen-bonding distance (23Ludwig M. Evans P.R. Banerjee R. Chemistry and Biochemistry of B12. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1999Google Scholar), could account for the perturbation. In papain, a mercaptide-imidazolium ion pair interaction in the active site raises the histidine pK a to 8.4 (34Polgar L. FEBS Lett. 1974; 47: 15-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Using ab initio molecular orbital calculations, Radom and co-workers (18Smith D.M. Golding B.T. Radom L. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1999; 121: 1383-1384Crossref Scopus (55) Google Scholar) recently demonstrated that the barrier for the intramolecular rearrangement of the 3-propanal radical, employed as a model for the methylmalonyl-CoA radical, can be lowered by 5.5 kJ mol−1 and 22.4 kJ mol−1 by partial proton transfer from HF and NH4+, respectively. This corresponds to a rate increase by approximately 1 and 4 orders of magnitude (for HF and NH4+, respectively) due to stabilization of the transition state by partial protonation by these acids. Histidine in the mutase active site may be expected to approximate NH4+ in the gas phase in terms of acid strength (18Smith D.M. Golding B.T. Radom L. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1999; 121: 1383-1384Crossref Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Our data indicate that in methylmalonyl-CoA mutase, the active-site residue, His-244, has a modest effect and enhances the catalytic efficiency approximately 2 orders of magnitude. The conservative mutation, H244Q, is similar to H244G, lowering k cat by a factor of 50 and raising K m for succinyl-CoA 2-fold, thus leading to a 100-fold-lower catalytic efficiency for the reverse reaction compared with the wild type enzyme (32Thomä N.H. Leadlay P.F. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1998; 26: 293-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The pH dependence ofV max has not been reported for either the H244A or H244Q mutants (32Thomä N.H. Leadlay P.F. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1998; 26: 293-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). In summary, this study demonstrates that a major role of His-244 is in shielding the reactive radical intermediates formed during the rearrangement reaction from interception by oxygen. In addition, they furnish support for the participation of His-244 as a general acid in the mutase reaction. To our knowledge, these data provide the first experimental support for the ab initio molecular orbital theory-based calculations that partial proton transfer may facilitate the rearrangement reaction in this AdoCbl-dependent enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W2163714782,"We have shown that the domain V of bacterial 23 S rRNA could fold denatured proteins to their active state. This segment of 23 S rRNA could further be split into two parts. One part containing mainly the central loop of domain V could bind denatured human carbonic anhydrase I stably. This association could be reversed by adding the other part of domain V. The released enzyme was directed in such a way by the central loop of domain V that it could now fold by itself to active form. This agrees with our earlier observation that proteins fold within the cell posttranslationally, a process that is completed after release of the newly synthesized polypeptide from the ribosome (Chattopadhyay, S., Pal, S., Chandra, S., Sarkar, D., and DasGupta, C.

This in vitro protein folding activity has been found to reside in the domain V of the 23 S rRNA in 50 S particle of the ribosome. This activity of ribosome has also been identifiedin vivo by showing slow posttranslational activation of the enzyme β-galactosidase in Escherichia coli that was synthesized just prior to the addition of the 30 S specific protein synthesis inhibitors kasugamycin and streptomycin. This posttranslational activation, however, was immediately arrested by adding antibiotics that bind to domain V of 23 S rRNA of 50 S ribosomal particle (1Chattopadhyay S. Pal S. Chandra S. Sarkar D.

This implied that there were at least two steps in these reactions: (a) interaction with unfolded proteins to fold them and (b) dissociation from the folded proteins. We took the 660-nt-long domain V RNA from Bacillus subtilis and further split it into two smaller pieces that acted in a particular sequence on the unfolded protein to fold it. Here we present the role of these two parts of domain V in refolding denatured proteins. Human carbonic anhydrase I (EC4.2.1.1), pig muscle lactate dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.27), and porcine heart cytoplasmic malate dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.37) were purchased from Sigma. The enzymes gave single bands of monomeric molecular weights 29,800, 31,000, and 35,000, respectively, in SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. These enzymes are referred to as carbonic anhydrase, lactate dehydrogenase, and malate dehydrogenase in the text. All the laboratory reagents used were of analytical grade. Purification of 70 S ribosome, its 50 S subunit, and 23 S rRNA from E. coli MRE 600 have been described previously (6Das B. Chattopadhyay S. Bera A.K. Dasgupta C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 235: 613-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The 23 S rRNA was separated from 5 S RNA by gel filtration. The purity of 23 S rRNA was checked by (a) electrophoresis in a composite gel 0.5% agarose and 3% of a 19:1 (by mass) mixture of acrylamide/N,N′-methylene bisacrylamide, (b) anA 260/A 280 greater than 2.0, and (c) 40% hyperchromicity on RNase digestion at 37 °C. The 23 S rRNAs from many bacterial species includingE. coli and B. subtilis have identical secondary structures where the nucleotides in the single-stranded region, especially the central loop of domain V, are invariant. The nucleotides can vary in the double-stranded regions from one bacterial species to another, but the conformations remain the same. Therefore, we took the cloned domain V of B. subtilis 23 S rDNA because it has convenient restriction sites that are lacking in the corresponding region of the E. coli 23 S rDNA. The 660-nt-long domain V RNA of B. subtilis, its 337-nt-long segment containing mainly the central loop of domain V, and another 425-nt-long segment from the 5′ end were transcribed from plasmids pDK105 linearized withSmaI, pDK106 linearized with EcoRI, and pDK105 linearized with SmaI, respectively. All the transcriptions were done from SP6 promoter by SP6 RNA polymerase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The plasmids pDK105 and pDK106 were kind gifts from B. Weisblum, Madison, WI. The DNA templates were digested with RNase-free DNase I, and RNA was precipitated with ethanol after phenol extraction. The amount of RNA synthesized was estimated by adding a trace amount of [α-32P]UTP with the ribonucleotides and measuring its incorporation in RNA. We call the 337- and 425-nt-long RNA molecules RNA1 and RNA2, respectively (see Fig. 2). The enzyme (100 mm) was mixed with a 50-fold molar excess of FITC at pH 8.7 and kept in ice for 1 h. The labeled enzyme was separated from unincorporated FITC by Sephadex G-25 gel filtration column. The enzyme activity did not change due to FITC labeling, and it did not interfere with denaturation and refolding of the enzyme. Fluorescence emission from FITC-labeled protein was obtained by exciting at 495 nm and measuring emission at 520 nm using a Hitachi F3010 fluorescence spectrophotometer. Fluorescence labeling of the enzyme was necessary for its quantitation in experiments where the amount of enzyme was so small that we could not use its activity,A 280, or intrinsic fluorescence of tryptophan residues for quantitation. Carbonic anhydrase was denatured at a concentration of 10 μm with 6m guanidine- hydrochloride for 2 h at 25 °C. The protein lost its secondary structure as revealed by its CD spectrum. For refolding, the denatured protein was diluted 100-fold (final concentration: 100 nm) in a buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 5 mm magnesium acetate, and 200 mm NaCl and incubated at 25 °C for 30 min with or without folding modulators. The activity of refolded enzyme was assayed by adding 500 μm para-nitrophenyl acetate to the refolding mixture and measuring the increase inA 400 with time when incubated at 25 °C. The concentrations of enzyme and ribosomal RNA, etc., varied in different experiments and are mentioned in appropriate places. Lactate dehydrogenase, a homotetrameric enzyme, was denatured at a concentration of 3.2 μm with respect to monomer with 1m guanidine hydrochloride at 20 °C for 1 h (9Chattopadhyay S. Das B. DasGupta C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 8284-8287Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). For refolding, the enzyme was diluted 100-fold in 20 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 200 mm NaCl, and 4 mmmagnesium acetate and incubated at 20 °C for 30 min with or without RNA (9Chattopadhyay S. Das B. DasGupta C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 8284-8287Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The enzyme concentration was 32 nm with respect to monomer during refolding. Malate dehydrogenase, a homodimeric enzyme, was denatured at a concentration of 1.15 μm with respect to monomer with 6 m guanidine hydrochloride at 20 °C for 40 min. For refolding the denatured enzyme was diluted 80-fold in 25 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.6, 200 mm NaCl, 5 mm 2 mercaptoethanol, and 4 mm magnesium acetate and incubated at 20 °C for 15 min in the presence or absence of RNA. The enzyme concentration during refolding was 14 nmwith respect to monomer. For all the enzymes, refolding was over by the time of incubation mentioned above. The extent of refolding was calculated by taking the ratio of the activity of the refolded enzyme to the activity of the same amount of native enzyme. Linearized plasmid pDK106 was transcribed in presence of [α-32P]UTP to prepare 32P-labeled 337-nt-long RNA1, the DNA template was destroyed, and then the RNA was purified by phenol extraction and ethanol precipitation. Denatured carbonic anhydrase was added in refolding buffer containing this radiolabeled RNA1 at 25 °C. The concentrations of RNA1 and the enzyme were 25 and 50 nm, respectively. All RNA1 molecules would not be trapped by the enzyme at this concentration. The enzyme-RNA1 complex was divided in two equal parts. One part was loaded on a 5% native polyacrylamide gel, and the other part was treated with 1% SDS at 50 °C for 15 min and loaded on the same gel. The gel was run in TBE buffer and exposed to x-ray film for autoradiography. Steady state fluorescence was measured using a Hitachi F 3010 spectrofluorimeter. Quenching of fluorescence emission from tryptophan residues was obtained by recording the intensities (excitation: 290 nm; emission: 330 nm) after successive addition of small aliquots of quencher (acrylamide) stock solutions. A nominal bandpass of 5 nm for the excitation and 5 nm for the emission was used. The fraction of tryptophan residues that are accessible to the quencher molecule could be estimated from the equationF 0/(F 0 −F) = 1/(K sv·fe ·(Q) +1/fe (12Lehrer S.S. Biochemistry. 1971; 10: 3254-3263Crossref PubMed Scopus (1654) Google Scholar), where fe is the fraction of total number of tryptophan residues in carbonic anhydrase accessible to the quencher, F 0 is the fluorescence intensity in absence of the quencher, F is the fluorescence intensity at the quencher concentration Q, andK sv is Stern-Volmer quenching constant assuming purely dynamic quenching. Fig. 1 shows the refolding of three denatured enzymes, carbonic anhydrase (monomer), malate dehydrogenase (homodimer), and lactate dehydrogenase (homotetramer) with 50 S ribosomal subunit, its 23 S rRNA, and the domain V of 23 S rRNA. The concentration of denatured enzymes were 100, 14, and 32 nm, respectively, with respect to monomer. Although all of them could refold the denatured enzyme, there was a gradual decrease in the extent of refolding as we went from 50 S subunit to the domain V of its 23 S rRNA. This protein folding activity was specific for domain V RNA. The 16 S rRNA, tRNA, and regions of 23 S rRNA other than domain V (e.g. the domain II of 23 S rRNA) did not show this activity (3Chattopadhyay S. Das B. Bera A.K. DasGupta C. Biochem. J. 1994; 300: 717-721Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 4Bera A.K. Das B. Chattopadhyay S. DasGupta C. Curr. Sci. 1994; 66: 230-262Google Scholar, 9Chattopadhyay S. Das B. DasGupta C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 8284-8287Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The activity could also be destroyed by RNase (3Chattopadhyay S. Das B. Bera A.K. DasGupta C. Biochem. J. 1994; 300: 717-721Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 4Bera A.K. Das B. Chattopadhyay S. DasGupta C. Curr. Sci. 1994; 66: 230-262Google Scholar). As mentioned under “Discussion,” although the domain V provides the crucial site for refolding (9Chattopadhyay S. Das B. DasGupta C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 8284-8287Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 10Pal D. Chattopadhyay S. Chandra S. Sarkar D. Chakrabarty A. DasGupta C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 5047-5051Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) other regions of 23 S rRNA may also provide additional sites to interact with denatured proteins to increase the yield of refolded enzymes. However, the domain V appears to provide the minimum length of RNA that shows peptidyl transferase activity (13Noller H.F. Hoffarth V. Zimniak Z. Science. 1992; 256: 1416-1419Crossref PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar, 14Nitta I. Kamada Y. Noda H. Veda T. Watnabe K. Science. 1998; 281: 666-669Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) and protein folding activity, which is sensitive to antibiotics that prevent protein synthesis and folding in vitro and in vivo (1Chattopadhyay S. Pal S. Chandra S. Sarkar D. DasGupta C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1429: 293-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 10Pal D. Chattopadhyay S. Chandra S. Sarkar D. Chakrabarty A. DasGupta C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 5047-5051Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Therefore, we turned our attention to the domain V and went on to see if the active site(s) could be further narrowed down to any part of it. The increased activity of the refolded enzymes was not due to some fortuitous effect of the ribosomes/the subunits and RNAs. The native enzymes did not show any increase in activity in presence of any of the modulators. The reduced ability of domain V RNA to fold protein compared with 50 S particle could also be due to partial loss of its structure in absence of ribosomal proteins. The 23 S RNA has been shown to lose its peptidyl transferase activity due to deproteinization (13Noller H.F. Hoffarth V. Zimniak Z. Science. 1992; 256: 1416-1419Crossref PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar). It may also be necessary to vary reaction conditions to optimize the protein folding activity of domain V RNA. It should also be mentioned here that ribosomes/ribosomal RNA refolds some intermediate(s) of spontaneous folding of the enzyme since the secondary and some tertiary structures are formed in the dead time of dilution of denaturant. We took the 660-nucleotide-long domain V ofB. subtilis 23 S rRNA for this purpose. As mentioned under “Experimental Procedures,” it can be easily divided into two parts with some overlap. One of them is a 337-nucleotide-long in vitro transcript, obtained using EcoRI-cleaved pDK106 template, which possesses mainly the single stranded large circle of domain V but lacks the elaborate stem loop part, which is deleted in the cloned gene (kindly provided by Prof. B. Weisblum, University of Wisconsin, Madison, WI). We call this RNA1. The other is transcribed from plasmid pDK105 after cutting it with restriction endonucleaseSmaI. This gives a 425-nt-long RNA having mainly the elaborate stem loop part toward the 5′ end of domain V, but it lacks most of the large circle. We call this RNA2. The putative secondary structures of 660-, 337-, and 425-nt RNA are shown in Fig.2 (15Kovalic D. Giannattasio R.B. Weisblum B. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 15838-15844Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Refolding of denatured carbonic anhydrase (100 nm), malate dehydrogenase (14 nm), and lactate dehydrogenase (32 nm) with different concentration of the two RNA moieties mixed in 1:1 ratio are shown in Fig. 3. The extent of refolding was the same as that of refolding with 660-nt-long RNA (compare with Fig. 1). Therefore, these two RNA molecules complement each other in the refolding reaction. They either act independently on the unfolded proteins (see below) or form a composite RNA through tertiary interactions between themselves and then refold the denatured protein. This and the subsequent experiments were carried out with carbonic anhydrase only because with a relatively small monomeric protein the results would be easier to interpret. To check whether these two RNA moieties reacted independently or not, we added one of them to denatured carbonic anhydrase, waited for 15 min, and then added the other. Following an additional incubation of 30 min, the enzyme activity was assayed. We found recovery of enzyme activity only when the order of addition was RNA1 followed by RNA2. We could wait for a sufficiently long time, even more than 1 h, after adding RNA1 and then add RNA2. The final recovery of activity was the same as the recovery with the two RNA molecules added together in unimolecular ratio. Fig.4 shows that the enzyme activity recovered when RNA1 was added first, but did not do so when RNA2 was added first. The total concentration of RNA varied in different sets, but the ratio of the RNA moieties was always maintained as 1:1. As shown in Fig. 4, maximum recovery of enzyme activity was obtained when the ratio of enzyme (33 nm):RNA (unimolecular mixture of RNA1 and RNA2) was 1:1. There was slight inhibition in the recovery at higher RNA concentration (6Das B. Chattopadhyay S. Bera A.K. Dasgupta C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 235: 613-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 9Chattopadhyay S. Das B. DasGupta C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 8284-8287Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 10Pal D. Chattopadhyay S. Chandra S. Sarkar D. Chakrabarty A. DasGupta C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 5047-5051Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Fig.5 shows the time course of recovery of enzyme activity in an experiment where RNA2 concentration varied. Here the RNA1 was added in equimolar ratio with the denatured enzyme (132 nm), and RNA2 was added after 15 min in different molar ratios of RNA1:RNA2, from 1:1 to 1:1/8. As is apparent from Fig.5 A, the RNA1-bound enzyme was not active. About 20% enzyme activity, which appears in presence of RNA1 only, was about the same as the recovery of activity without ribosomal assistance. This might be due to the enzyme molecules, which failed to bind to RNA1 but went straight to the true pathway of spontaneous folding. RNA-assisted recovery of activity was seen after RNA2 was added. The maximum recovery of activity was the same irrespective of the concentration of RNA2, the only difference being the rate of the recovery of enzyme activity, which was slower with lower concentration of RNA2. A quick gel filtration assay with the sample where RNA1:RNA2 ratio was 1:1 showed that the enzyme dissociated from RNA before its activity reached its peak. This showed that the dissociated folding intermediates could be protected by RNA and then released on the true folding pathway. All these time courses of recovery of enzyme activity with different concentrations of RNA2 could be plotted in a linear logarithmic plot, showing that they represented first order reaction (Fig.5 B). On the other hand, the first step of the refolding reaction (the binding of denatured enzyme to RNA1, which gave a stable RNA-bound folding intermediate) was obviously a first order reaction with respect to enzyme concentration, but it was too fast to be considered as the rate-limiting step in the overall refolding reaction. It should be mentioned here that we cannot vary the concentration of RNA1 below the level of enzyme concentration. In fact, we need it in 5-fold excess of denatured enzyme molecules to bind all of them. 2S. Chowdhury, S. Pal, S. Chandra, D. Sarkar, A. N. Ghosh, and C. Das Gupta, unpublished observation. Figure 5A, recovery of activity of denatured carbonic anhydrase when RNA1 was added to it (■), followed by RNA2 at mole to mole ratio of RNA1: RNA2 of 1:1 (○), 1:1/2 (▪), 1:1/4 (▵), and 1:1/8 (▴). B, first order plot with the same symbols as in the time course of recovery shown in A.C, time course of recovery of activity of RNA1-bound denatured carbonic anhydrase when released by 0.2% Triton X-100 (▪) and 3% ethanol (▵).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The RNA2 could be just competing with the protein folding intermediate to bind to RNA1 so that the latter was displaced, or RNA2 could play an active role in the process of folding the RNA1-bound denatured protein and then release it. To distinguish between these two possibilities, we added small quantities of non ionic detergent Triton X-100 (final concentration 0.2%) or ethanol (final concentration 3%) to the RNA1-bound carbonic anhydrase (100 nm). In both the cases, the enzyme dissociated from RNA1 and, like the RNA2-mediated released enzyme, folded slowly to active form although the recovery of activity was slightly less than the RNA2-mediated process, as shown in Fig. 5 C. The small amount of ethanol and Triton X-100 had no effect on the activity of enzyme. Therefore, the RNA2 did not play any active role in folding denatured carbonic anhydrase. Its function was to release the protein so that it could fold to active form by itself. This puts the RNA1, which is basically the large central loop of the domain V of 23 S rRNA, at the center stage of protein folding. This 337-nt-long RNA could possibly trap the protein folding intermediates at a stage where misfolding due to non-native interactions of its different segments would lead to loss of enzyme activity. A simple reduction in the non-native interactions of different protein segments might ensure the formation of on-pathway folding intermediates. The experiments below show that the RNA1-bound denatured enzyme was a true intermediate in this process of folding. During refolding, the denatured carbonic anhydrase remained bound as a stable intermediate with RNA1 and this RNA-enzyme complex could be recovered by gel filtration through Sephadex G-100 column. The RNA and protein were labeled with [α-32P]UTP and FITC, respectively. The FITC helped to quantitate the enzyme even at low concentration which was used in these experiments irrespective of whether it was in native or in denatured state. A part of the RNA-protein complex was loaded on the column. As shown in Fig.6 A, the complex eluted out in the void volume whereas a small fraction of unbound enzyme was retained in the column and eluted later in the same fraction as the native enzyme (Fig. 6 A, c). The RNA-bound enzyme in void volume showed no activity. The small amount of unbound enzyme could have gone through the process of spontaneous folding and its activity was too small to measure (spontaneous folding was 20% in such experiments). To the remaining RNA-bound enzyme, RNA2 was added at a ratio of protein:RNA as 1:1/8. After incubation for 1 h, the enzyme activity was assayed and the reaction mixture was loaded on the same column. As shown in the elution profile (Fig. 6 A,d), the reactivated enzyme dissociated from the RNA1 and eluted at the same position as the native enzyme. Here, the total count in the RNA in void volume was equal to the sum of counts in RNA1 and RNA2. More than 80% of the refolded enzyme activity was found in the protein peak. Very little enzyme remained associated with RNA in the void volume. Therefore, the RNA1 keeps the folding intermediates of the enzyme tightly bound, which can be dissociated from it by RNA2 before or after refolding. If it is dissociated before refolding, the intermediate must fold spontaneously, i.e. it must be an on-pathway intermediate for spontaneous folding. In such a case the role of RNA1and RNA2 could be rather passive, that of protecting the folding intermediates against the forces of misfolding. In any event, the RNA-bound protein gave a stable intermediate in this refolding pathway that should be thoroughly characterized. We have also seen the stable binding of the refolding carbonic anhydrase to RNA1 in 5% polyacrylamide gel. As shown in Fig.6 B, the enzyme-bound RNA1 (50 nm enzyme:25 nm RNA1) migrated slower than the control unbound RNA1. When the enzyme was released by treatment with 1% SDS, RNA1 migrated to the same position as its control. RNA1 was added at half the enzyme concentration to ensure that both the enzyme-bound as well as free RNA1 could be detected in the gel. To bind all RNA1 molecules, the enzyme concentration should be about 5 times that of RNA1 (data not shown). Recently, we have developed a filter binding assay where the RNA1 gets trapped on the filter only when it is bound by the refolding protein. Therefore, the binding to and the release of the protein from RNA1 can be quantitated. This would help to select mutants of RNA1, made by site-directed mutagenesis, which are deficient in binding/refolding proteins. We have preliminary observation with one such mutant, which is defective in binding/refolding denatured carbonic anhydrase.2 We are thus in the process of identifying nucleotides in RNA1 that directly interact with the protein or ensure its binding to RNA1. Carbonic anhydrase has six tryptophan residues (16Barlow H.J. Lowe N. Edwards H.Y. Butterworth P.H.W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 2386Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), which fluoresce strongly in the native enzyme when excited at 290 nm. We used this strong fluorescence emission, which peaks at around 330 nm, to probe the tertiary organization of the protein during denaturation and refolding. As shown in Fig.7 A, the tryptophan fluorescence quenched dramatically when the denatured protein was bound to RNA1. The intensity of emission increased quickly as soon as RNA2 was added. This was due to the release of the bound enzyme, and its time course is shown in inset of Fig. 7 A. The released enzyme was not active but took some time (presumably for fine tuning of the active site) to show its activity (Fig. 7 B). A quick spin column gel filtration assay after adding RNA2 but before the appearance of enzyme activity also showed that the enzyme dissociated from RNA1 (data not shown). Combining this with results of gel filtration experiments (shown in Fig. 6 A), we thus see that most of the denatured protein molecules bound to RNA1 were destined to go through on-pathway folding intermediates by themselves to be a"

In this study, we show that a gene of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, identified by similarity to that of animal ectoapyrase CD39, codes for a new member of the E-type ATPase family (Apy1p). Overexpression of Apy1p in yeast cells causes an increase in intracellular membrane-bound nucleoside di- and triphosphate hydrolase activity. The activity is highest with ADP as substrate and is stimulated similarly by Ca2+, Mg2+, and Mn2+. The results also indicate that Apy1p is an integral membrane protein located predominantly in the Golgi compartment. Sequence analysis reveals that Apy1p contains one large NH2-terminal hydrophilic apyrase domain, one COOH-terminal hydrophilic domain, and two hydrophobic stretches in the central region of the polypeptide. Although no signal sequence is found at the NH2-terminal portion of the protein and no NH2-terminal cleavage of the protein is observed, demonstrated by the detection of NH2-terminal tagged Apy1p, the NH2-terminal domain of Apylp is on the luminal side of the Golgi apparatus, and the COOH-terminal hydrophilic domain binds to the cytoplasmic face of the Golgi membrane. The second hydrophobic stretch of Apy1p is the transmembrane domain. These results indicate that Apylp is a type III transmembrane protein; however, the size of the Apy1p extracytoplasmic NH2 terminus is much larger than those of other type III transmembrane proteins, suggesting that a novel translocation mechanism is utilized.

Transmembrane proteins of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and ER-derived cell organelles are inserted cotranslationally into the ER membrane in a signal recognition particle-dependent manner (19Hegde R.S.

During the insertion process, membrane topology is determined by interaction between topogenic signals within the nascent protein and the translocation machinery; these signals are only partially understood (22Harley C.A. Holt J.A. Turner R. Tipper D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24963-24971Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Four types of single-spanning membrane proteins can be distinguished based on the topogenic sequence involved in the insertion (23von Heijne G. Gavel Y. Eur. J. Biochem. 1988; 174: 671-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (566) Google Scholar, 24Kutay U.H.E. Rapoport T.A. Trends Cell Biol. 1993; 3: 72-75Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). Type I membrane proteins have a cleaved NH2-terminal signal sequence followed by a transmembrane anchor segment, and their mature NH2 terminus is extracytoplasmic (Nexo). Type II proteins contain an uncleaved signal/anchor sequence resulting in the cytoplasmic localization of the NH2 terminus (Ncyto). In type III proteins, the NH2 terminus is translocated to the lumen of the ER (Nexo), and the signal sequence is not cleaved (23von Heijne G. Gavel Y. Eur. J. Biochem. 1988; 174: 671-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (566) Google Scholar). Type IV proteins have a Ncyto/Cexo topology like type II proteins but have the transmembrane segment very close to the COOH terminus and are inserted into the ER membrane by uncharacterized machinery (24Kutay U.H.E. Rapoport T.A. Trends Cell Biol. 1993; 3: 72-75Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar, 25Kutay U. Ahnert-Hilger G. Hartmann E. Wiedenmann B. Rapoport T.A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 217-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). All reported membrane-bound E-ATPases have a type II-like orientation.In the lumen of the Golgi apparatus, proteins and lipids become glycosylated. Nucleotide sugars are synthesized in the cytosol and transported into the Golgi lumen via specific carrier proteins (26Abeijon C. Mandon E.C. Hirschberg C.B. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 203-207Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar,27Hirschberg C.B. Robbins P.W. Abeijon C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 49-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). After transfer of sugar residues to proteins and lipids by glycosyltransferases, the resulting nucleoside diphosphates are converted to nucleoside monophosphates by nucleotide diphosphatases. In this way, nucleoside diphosphates that are inhibitors of glycosyltransferases do not accumulate in the lumen of the Golgi apparatus. The nucleoside monophosphates exit the lumen of Golgi in exchange with cytosolic sugar nucleotides. It has been shown previously that a Saccharomyces cerevisiae GDPase (GDA1) is required for protein and lipid mannosylation (17Abeijon C. Yanagisawa K. Mandon E.C. Hausler A. Moremen K. Hirschberg C.B. Robbins P.W. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 307-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 28Berninsone P. Miret J.J. Hirschberg C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 207-211Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Gda1p was recognized as an E-ATPase because of its similarity to potato apyrase (6Handa M. Guidotti G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 218: 916-923Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar) and to animal ectoapyrase CD39 (5Wang T.F. Guidotti G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9898-9901Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). Deletion of the gene has a minor effect on the growth of yeast but does result in decreased mannosylation of membrane proteins (28Berninsone P. Miret J.J. Hirschberg C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 207-211Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A sequence homology search in the GenBank data base revealed another gene from S. cerevisiae (GenBank accession number P40009) with high similarity in the ACR1–4 motifs to members of the E-ATPase family. This gene is on chromosome V, encodes a hypothetical 71.9-kDa protein, and was proposed recently to be the second E-ATPase found in yeast (14Wang T.F. Guidotti G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11392-11399Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). In this study, we demonstrate that this 71.9-kDa protein is indeed a novel E- ATPase. Interestingly, it is located in the Golgi and has an unusual membrane topology.DISCUSSIONIn this study, we have demonstrated that a putative yeast 71.9-kDa protein (Apy1p) is a new member of the E-ATPase family. Apy1p hydrolyzes various nucleotides, and its activity is highest with ADP. By membrane fractionation and immunofluorescence staining, Apy1p was found to be localized in the Golgi apparatus. Based on the results of protease protection assays and site-directed mutagenesis experiments, we have shown that Apy1p has a large NH2-terminal extracellular domain, a transmembrane domain, and a smaller COOH-terminal cytoplasmic domain; the protein does not have an explicit signal sequence.It is interesting that there are two E-ATPases in yeast, and both are located in the Golgi. Yeast GDPase is involved in protein and lipid mannosylation. Its null mutant (gda1) is viable, but it has a partial block in O- and N-glycosylation of secreted proteins and a decrease in the transport of GDP-mannose into the Golgi lumen (17Abeijon C. Yanagisawa K. Mandon E.C. Hausler A. Moremen K. Hirschberg C.B. Robbins P.W. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 307-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 28Berninsone P. Miret J.J. Hirschberg C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 207-211Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The APY1 null mutant (apy1) is viable and grows at approximately the same rate as the wild type at 30 °C; the double deletion mutant (gda apy1) is also viable and grows approximately four times more slowly than the wild type strain. 2X. Zhong and G. Guidotti, unpublished observations. Because the yeast GDP-mannose transporter null mutation is lethal, suggesting that glycosylation of protein and lipid in the Golgi is essential (52Dean N. Zhang Y.B. Poster J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31908-31914Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar), it appears that the activities of Gda1p and Apy1p are not essential for protein and lipid glycosylation, probably because there is yet another way to hydrolyze nucleotide diphosphates. As the enzymatic properties of these two enzymes are different, further experiments are required to determine whether they have different biological functions.Another possible function of Apy1p is in the conversion of ADP to AMP, which is then used as an antiporter in the translocation of ATP into the Golgi. It has been reported that an ATP transport activity is required for phosphorylation of proteoglycans and secretory proteins in the lumen of the Golgi apparatus and that the translocation of ATP into the Golgi lumen is coupled to the exit of AMP (27Hirschberg C.B. Robbins P.W. Abeijon C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 49-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar, 53Capasso J.M. Keenan T.W. Abeijon C. Hirschberg C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 5233-5240Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This hypothesis is consistent with the view that the antiport molecules for sugar nucleotide transport into the Golgi are nucleoside monophosphates (27Hirschberg C.B. Robbins P.W. Abeijon C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 49-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). In a recent paper (54Thomas C. Sun Y. Naus K. Lloyd A. Roux S. Plant Physiol. 1999; 119: 543-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) it has been suggested that a plant ectoapyrase may be involved in phosphate transport; it is possible that Gda1p and Apy1p are a link to transport of phosphates in the Golgi.Apylp has a broad substrate specificity, whereas yeast GDPase (Gdp1p) is quite specific for GDP (17Abeijon C. Yanagisawa K. Mandon E.C. Hausler A. Moremen K. Hirschberg C.B. Robbins P.W. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 307-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). The divalent cation preference of these enzymes is also different (17Abeijon C. Yanagisawa K. Mandon E.C. Hausler A. Moremen K. Hirschberg C.B. Robbins P.W. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 307-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). The family of E-type ATPases embraces enzymes that are specific for ATP (55Smith T.M. Kirley T.L. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 321-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 56Heine P. Braun N. Heilbronn A. Zimmerman H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 262: 102-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar), for nucleotide di- and triphosphates (1Plesner L. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1995; 158: 141-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar), and nucleoside diphosphates (17Abeijon C. Yanagisawa K. Mandon E.C. Hausler A. Moremen K. Hirschberg C.B. Robbins P.W. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 307-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). At present, the structural basis for the substrate specificity is not known and cannot be deduced by examination of the primary structures of the enzymes.The most surprising finding in this study is that a large NH2-terminal apyrase domain is located in the Golgi lumen although it lacks a signal sequence for translocation through the membrane. Only a few membrane proteins with a long extracellular NH2 terminus lacking a signal sequence are known. Some G protein-coupled receptors belong in this class, but their NH2-terminal segment is less than 100 residues; above this size limit, an NH2-terminal signal sequence is employed (51Wallin E. von Heijne G. Protein Eng. 1995; 8: 693-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). It has been reported that Neu differentiation factor has a 240-amino acid extracellular NH2 terminus and lacks a typical signal sequence, but the NH2-terminal 13 amino acids are cleaved, suggesting the existence of some kind of NH2-terminal signal (57Wen D. Peles E. Cupples R. Suggs S.V. Bacus S.S. Luo Y. Trail G. Hu S. Silbiger S.M. Levy R.B. Koski R.A. Lu H.S. Yarden Y. Cell. 1992; 69: 559-572Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar). To our knowledge, Apy1p has the longest translocated NH2 terminus reported so far. If translocation of the NH2 terminus of Apy1p takes place by a new mechanism, Apy1p may be classified as a type V transmembrane protein. We predict that hypothetical protein C33H5.14 ofCaenorhabditis elegans, a candidate E-ATPase member (14Wang T.F. Guidotti G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11392-11399Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), also belongs to this new subgroup because the primary sequence suggests that it has a large hydrophilic NH2-terminal apyrase domain lacking a signal sequence and a single hydrophobic segment.The mechanism for the translocation of the NH2-terminal domain of Apy1p across the membrane should be different from those of type I and III membrane proteins. It has been shown that the orientation of the insertion of the transmembrane segments of membrane proteins correlates best with Δ(C-N), the difference in charges within an arbitrary window of 15 residues flanking the transmembrane segment on either side (58Hartmann E. Rapoport T.A. Lodish H.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 5786-5790Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar). Because the end of the transmembrane segment with the most positive charges is retained in the cytoplasm, the value of Δ(C-N) can be used to predict the orientation of the transmembrane segment. Similar to type III proteins, the value of Δ(C-N) for Apy1p is positive in accordance with our localization of the NH2 terminus and COOH terminus in the lumen of the Golgi and in the cytoplasm, respectively.Compared with other E-ATPases, Apy1p has a long COOH-terminal domain. Most of it may bind to the cytoplasmic face of the Golgi membrane, probably because of its highly positive charge. The functional significance of this binding is unknown; however, deletion of two-thirds of the COOH-terminal domain does not affect the membrane topology of APy1p. It is worthy of notice that a single tyrosine kinase phosphorylation site is present at the end of the COOH-terminal domain (622–629 KFKDSRLY). It will be interesting to find out whether this site can really be phosphorylated and whether there is any activity change when this site is mutated or deleted.In summary, we have shown that a yeast hypothetical 71.9-kDa protein, Apy1p, possesses a cation-stimulated nucleotidase activity and is located mainly in the Golgi. We also demonstrate that Apy1p has a large translocated NH2 terminus and an unusual membrane topology. Based on the distinct features of Apy1p, we propose that Apy1p and a hypothetical protein of C. elegans belong to new subgroup of transmembrane proteins.

Guidotti G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 218: 916-923Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). CD39 was subsequently shown to exhibit E- ATPase activity (5Wang T.F. Guidotti G. J. Biol.

Transmembrane proteins of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and ER-derived cell organelles are inserted cotranslationally into the ER membrane in a signal recognition particle-dependent manner (19Hegde R.S. Lingappa V.R. Cell. 1997; 91: 575-582Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 20Powers T. Walter P.

During the insertion process, membrane topology is determined by interaction between topogenic signals within the nascent protein and the translocation machinery; these signals are only partially understood (22Harley C.A. Holt J.A. Turner R. Tipper D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24963-24971Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Four types of single-spanning membrane proteins can be distinguished based on the topogenic sequence involved in the insertion (23von Heijne G. Gavel Y. Eur. J. Biochem. 1988; 174: 671-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (566) Google Scholar, 24Kutay U.H.E. Rapoport T.A. Trends Cell Biol. 1993; 3: 72-75Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). Type I membrane proteins have a cleaved NH2-terminal signal sequence followed by a transmembrane anchor segment, and their mature NH2 terminus is extracytoplasmic (Nexo). Type II proteins contain an uncleaved signal/anchor sequence resulting in the cytoplasmic localization of the NH2 terminus (Ncyto). In type III proteins, the NH2 terminus is translocated to the lumen of the ER (Nexo), and the signal sequence is not cleaved (23von Heijne G. Gavel Y. Eur. J. Biochem. 1988; 174: 671-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (566) Google Scholar). Type IV proteins have a Ncyto/Cexo topology like type II proteins but have the transmembrane segment very close to the COOH terminus and are inserted into the ER membrane by uncharacterized machinery (24Kutay U.H.E. Rapoport T.A. Trends Cell Biol. 1993; 3: 72-75Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar, 25Kutay U. Ahnert-Hilger G. Hartmann E. Wiedenmann B. Rapoport T.A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 217-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). All reported membrane-bound E-ATPases have a type II-like orientation. In the lumen of the Golgi apparatus, proteins and lipids become glycosylated. Nucleotide sugars are synthesized in the cytosol and transported into the Golgi lumen via specific carrier proteins (26Abeijon C. Mandon E.C. Hirschberg C.B. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 203-207Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar,27Hirschberg C.B. Robbins P.W. Abeijon C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 49-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). After transfer of sugar residues to proteins and lipids by glycosyltransferases, the resulting nucleoside diphosphates are converted to nucleoside monophosphates by nucleotide diphosphatases. In this way, nucleoside diphosphates that are inhibitors of glycosyltransferases do not accumulate in the lumen of the Golgi apparatus. The nucleoside monophosphates exit the lumen of Golgi in exchange with cytosolic sugar nucleotides. It has been shown previously that a Saccharomyces cerevisiae GDPase (GDA1) is required for protein and lipid mannosylation (17Abeijon C. Yanagisawa K. Mandon E.C. Hausler A. Moremen K. Hirschberg C.B. Robbins P.W. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 307-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 28Berninsone P. Miret J.J. Hirschberg C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 207-211Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Gda1p was recognized as an E-ATPase because of its similarity to potato apyrase (6Handa M. Guidotti G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 218: 916-923Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar) and to animal ectoapyrase CD39 (5Wang T.F. Guidotti G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9898-9901Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). Deletion of the gene has a minor effect on the growth of yeast but does result in decreased mannosylation of membrane proteins (28Berninsone P. Miret J.J. Hirschberg C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 207-211Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A sequence homology search in the GenBank data base revealed another gene from S. cerevisiae (GenBank accession number P40009) with high similarity in the ACR1–4 motifs to members of the E-ATPase family. This gene is on chromosome V, encodes a hypothetical 71.9-kDa protein, and was proposed recently to be the second E-ATPase found in yeast (14Wang T.F. Guidotti G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11392-11399Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). In this study, we demonstrate that this 71.9-kDa protein is indeed a novel E- ATPase. Interestingly, it is located in the Golgi and has an unusual membrane topology. DISCUSSIONIn this study, we have demonstrated that a putative yeast 71.9-kDa protein (Apy1p) is a new member of the E-ATPase family. Apy1p hydrolyzes various nucleotides, and its activity is highest with ADP. By membrane fractionation and immunofluorescence staining, Apy1p was found to be localized in the Golgi apparatus. Based on the results of protease protection assays and site-directed mutagenesis experiments, we have shown that Apy1p has a large NH2-terminal extracellular domain, a transmembrane domain, and a smaller COOH-terminal cytoplasmic domain; the protein does not have an explicit signal sequence.It is interesting that there are two E-ATPases in yeast, and both are located in the Golgi. Yeast GDPase is involved in protein and lipid mannosylation. Its null mutant (gda1) is viable, but it has a partial block in O- and N-glycosylation of secreted proteins and a decrease in the transport of GDP-mannose into the Golgi lumen (17Abeijon C. Yanagisawa K. Mandon E.C. Hausler A. Moremen K. Hirschberg C.B. Robbins P.W. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 307-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 28Berninsone P. Miret J.J. Hirschberg C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 207-211Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The APY1 null mutant (apy1) is viable and grows at approximately the same rate as the wild type at 30 °C; the double deletion mutant (gda apy1) is also viable and grows approximately four times more slowly than the wild type strain. 2X. Zhong and G. Guidotti, unpublished observations. Because the yeast GDP-mannose transporter null mutation is lethal, suggesting that glycosylation of protein and lipid in the Golgi is essential (52Dean N. Zhang Y.B. Poster J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31908-31914Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar), it appears that the activities of Gda1p and Apy1p are not essential for protein and lipid glycosylation, probably because there is yet another way to hydrolyze nucleotide diphosphates. As the enzymatic properties of these two enzymes are different, further experiments are required to determine whether they have different biological functions.Another possible function of Apy1p is in the conversion of ADP to AMP, which is then used as an antiporter in the translocation of ATP into the Golgi. It has been reported that an ATP transport activity is required for phosphorylation of proteoglycans and secretory proteins in the lumen of the Golgi apparatus and that the translocation of ATP into the Golgi lumen is coupled to the exit of AMP (27Hirschberg C.B. Robbins P.W. Abeijon C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 49-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar, 53Capasso J.M. Keenan T.W. Abeijon C. Hirschberg C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 5233-5240Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This hypothesis is consistent with the view that the antiport molecules for sugar nucleotide transport into the Golgi are nucleoside monophosphates (27Hirschberg C.B. Robbins P.W. Abeijon C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 49-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). In a recent paper (54Thomas C. Sun Y. Naus K. Lloyd A. Roux S. Plant Physiol. 1999; 119: 543-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) it has been suggested that a plant ectoapyrase may be involved in phosphate transport; it is possible that Gda1p and Apy1p are a link to transport of phosphates in the Golgi.Apylp has a broad substrate specificity, whereas yeast GDPase (Gdp1p) is quite specific for GDP (17Abeijon C. Yanagisawa K. Mandon E.C. Hausler A. Moremen K. Hirschberg C.B. Robbins P.W. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 307-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). The divalent cation preference of these enzymes is also different (17Abeijon C. Yanagisawa K. Mandon E.C. Hausler A. Moremen K. Hirschberg C.B. Robbins P.W. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 307-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). The family of E-type ATPases embraces enzymes that are specific for ATP (55Smith T.M. Kirley T.L. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 321-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 56Heine P. Braun N. Heilbronn A. Zimmerman H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 262: 102-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar), for nucleotide di- and triphosphates (1Plesner L. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1995; 158: 141-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar), and nucleoside diphosphates (17Abeijon C. Yanagisawa K. Mandon E.C. Hausler A. Moremen K. Hirschberg C.B. Robbins P.W. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 307-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). At present, the structural basis for the substrate specificity is not known and cannot be deduced by examination of the primary structures of the enzymes.The most surprising finding in this study is that a large NH2-terminal apyrase domain is located in the Golgi lumen although it lacks a signal sequence for translocation through the membrane. Only a few membrane proteins with a long extracellular NH2 terminus lacking a signal sequence are known. Some G protein-coupled receptors belong in this class, but their NH2-terminal segment is less than 100 residues; above this size limit, an NH2-terminal signal sequence is employed (51Wallin E. von Heijne G. Protein Eng. 1995; 8: 693-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). It has been reported that Neu differentiation factor has a 240-amino acid extracellular NH2 terminus and lacks a typical signal sequence, but the NH2-terminal 13 amino acids are cleaved, suggesting the existence of some kind of NH2-terminal signal (57Wen D. Peles E. Cupples R. Suggs S.V. Bacus S.S. Luo Y. Trail G. Hu S. Silbiger S.M. Levy R.B. Koski R.A. Lu H.S. Yarden Y. Cell. 1992; 69: 559-572Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar). To our knowledge, Apy1p has the longest translocated NH2 terminus reported so far. If translocation of the NH2 terminus of Apy1p takes place by a new mechanism, Apy1p may be classified as a type V transmembrane protein. We predict that hypothetical protein C33H5.14 ofCaenorhabditis elegans, a candidate E-ATPase member (14Wang T.F. Guidotti G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11392-11399Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), also belongs to this new subgroup because the primary sequence suggests that it has a large hydrophilic NH2-terminal apyrase domain lacking a signal sequence and a single hydrophobic segment.The mechanism for the translocation of the NH2-terminal domain of Apy1p across the membrane should be different from those of type I and III membrane proteins. It has been shown that the orientation of the insertion of the transmembrane segments of membrane proteins correlates best with Δ(C-N), the difference in charges within an arbitrary window of 15 residues flanking the transmembrane segment on either side (58Hartmann E. Rapoport T.A. Lodish H.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 5786-5790Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar). Because the end of the transmembrane segment with the most positive charges is retained in the cytoplasm, the value of Δ(C-N) can be used to predict the orientation of the transmembrane segment. Similar to type III proteins, the value of Δ(C-N) for Apy1p is positive in accordance with our localization of the NH2 terminus and COOH terminus in the lumen of the Golgi and in the cytoplasm, respectively.Compared with other E-ATPases, Apy1p has a long COOH-terminal domain. Most of it may bind to the cytoplasmic face of the Golgi membrane, probably because of its highly positive charge. The functional significance of this binding is unknown; however, deletion of two-thirds of the COOH-terminal domain does not affect the membrane topology of APy1p. It is worthy of notice that a single tyrosine kinase phosphorylation site is present at the end of the COOH-terminal domain (622–629 KFKDSRLY). It will be interesting to find out whether this site can really be phosphorylated and whether there is any activity change when this site is mutated or deleted.In summary, we have shown that a yeast hypothetical 71.9-kDa protein, Apy1p, possesses a cation-stimulated nucleotidase activity and is located mainly in the Golgi. We also demonstrate that Apy1p has a large translocated NH2 terminus and an unusual membrane topology. Based on the distinct features of Apy1p, we propose that Apy1p and a hypothetical protein of C. elegans belong to new subgroup of transmembrane proteins.

https://openalex.org/W2046800456,"Molecular modeling studies have previously suggested the possible presence of four aromatic residues (Phe452, Tyr532, Tyr535, and Phe538) near the adenine binding pocket of the catalytic site on the yeast V-ATPase A subunit (MacLeod, K. J., Vasilyeva, E., Baleja, J. D., and Forgac, M. (1998) J. Biol. Chem. 273, 150–156). To test the proximity of these aromatic residues to the adenine ring, the yeast V-ATPase containing wild-type and mutant forms of the A subunit was reacted with 2-azido-[32P]ADP, a photoaffinity analog that stably modifies tyrosine but not phenylalanine residues. Mutant forms of the A subunit were constructed in which the two endogenous tyrosine residues were replaced with phenylalanine and in which a single tyrosine was introduced at each of the four positions. Strong ATP-protectable labeling of the A subunit was observed for the wild-type and the mutant containing tyrosine at 532, significant ATP-protectable labeling was observed for the mutants containing tyrosine at positions 452 and 538, and only very weak labeling was observed for the mutants containing tyrosine at 535 or in which all four residues were phenylalanine. These results suggest that Tyr532 and possibly Phe452and Tyr538 are in close proximity to the adenine ring of ATP bound to the A subunit. In addition, the effects of mutations at Phe452, Tyr532, Tyr535, and Glu286 on dissociation of the peripheral V1 and integral V0 domains both in vivo and in vitro were examined. The results suggest that in vivodissociation requires catalytic activity while in vitrodissociation requires nucleotide binding to the catalytic site.

Strong ATP-protectable labeling of the A subunit was observed for the wild-type and the mutant containing tyrosine at 532, significant ATP-protectable labeling was observed for the mutants containing tyrosine at positions 452 and 538, and only very weak labeling was observed for the mutants containing tyrosine at 535 or in which all four residues were phenylalanine. These results suggest that Tyr532 and possibly Phe452and Tyr538 are in close proximity to the adenine ring of ATP bound to the A subunit. In addition, the effects of mutations at Phe452, Tyr532, Tyr535, and Glu286 on dissociation of the peripheral V1 and integral V0 domains both in vivo and in vitro were examined. The results suggest that in vivodissociation requires catalytic activity while in vitrodissociation requires nucleotide binding to the catalytic site. vacuolar proton-translocating adenosine triphosphatase F-type ATP synthase yeast extract-peptone-dextrose 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, WT, wild-type N-tris(hydroxymethyl)methylglycine The vacuolar proton-translocating ATPases (or V-ATPases)1 are a family of ATP-dependent proton pumps responsible for acidification of intracellular compartments in eukaryotic cells (1Forgac M.

In yeast, acidification of the central vacuole by the V-ATPase serves to activate protein degradation and to drive the uptake of solutes such as Ca2+ and amino acids for storage (5Anraku Y. Umemoto N. Hirata R. Ohya Y. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1992; 24: 395-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The V-ATPases are composed of two domains, a peripheral, cytoplasmic 570-kDa V1 domain responsible for nucleotide binding and hydrolysis, and a membrane integral 260-kDa V0 domain responsible for proton translocation across the membrane (1Forgac M.

The V1 domain contains eight different subunits (subunits A–H, with molecular masses 70–14 kDa) while the V0 domain contains five different subunits (subunits a, d, c“, c, and c′, with molecular masses from 100 to 17 kDa). The nucleotide binding subunits have been identified as the A and B subunits, which are believed to form a hexameric structure containing three copies of each subunit (11Arai H. Terres G. Pink S. Forgac M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 8796-8802Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Previous studies have demonstrated that the catalytic sites reside on the A subunits and that a second class of sites, termed “noncatalytic” sites, reside on the B subunits, giving a total of six nucleotide binding sites per complex (12Feng Y.

The A and B subunits of the V-ATPase are approximately 25% identical with the β and α subunits of the F-ATPase, respectively (16Bowman E.J. Tenney K. Bowman B. J. Biol.

Biomembr. 1996; 28: 403-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The x-ray crystal structures of F1 indicate that the nucleotide binding sites are located at the interface of the β and α subunits, with the catalytic sites residing primarily on the β subunits and the noncatalytic sites residing primarily on the α subunits (21Abrahams J.P. Leslie A.G. Lutter R. Walker J.E. Nature. 1994; 370: 621-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (2764) Google Scholar, 22Bianchet M.A. Hullihen J. Pedersen P.L. Amzel L.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Kane P.M. Newman P.R. Forgac M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2018-2022Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 24Liu J. Kane P.M.

Chem. 1998; 273: 150-156Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), the structure of the nucleotide binding sites on the V-ATPase has yet to be determined. One approach to characterizing the structure of nucleotide binding sites is the use of photoaffinity analogs. 2-Azido-[32P]ATP has been used to label both the catalytic and noncatalytic nucleotide binding sites of the F-ATPase (27Cross R.L. Cunningham D. Miller C.G. Xue Z. Zhou J.M. Boyer P.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 5715-5719Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 28Wise J.G. Hicke B.J. Boyer P.D.

Chem. 1993; 268: 6241-6247Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), as well as the nucleotide binding sites of the bovine coated vesicle V-ATPase (13Zhang J. Vasilyeva E. Feng Y. Forgac M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15494-15500Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The reactive nitrene moiety generated upon photoactivation of 2-azido-ATP has been shown to have a strong preference for reaction with tyrosine residues (over, for example, phenylalanine residues). Thus, 2-azido-[32P]ATP reacts with Tyr368 at the catalytic site of the bovine mitochondrial F1 β subunit (27Cross R.L. Cunningham D. Miller C.G. Xue Z. Zhou J.M. Boyer P.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 5715-5719Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar), but substitution of phenylalanine at the corresponding position in the Escherichia coli β subunit prevents the formation of a stable adduct. 2A. Senior and R. Cross, personal communication. In addition, when 2-azido-[32P]ATP is loaded at the noncatalytic sites of F1, modification of Tyrβ354 is observed (28Wise J.G. Hicke B.J. Boyer P.D. FEBS Lett. 1987; 223: 395-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar,29Weber J. Lee R.S.-F. Wilke-Mounts S. Grell E. Senior A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 6241-6247Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Replacement of this tyrosine residue with phenylalanine eliminates labeling of the β subunit and shifts the label to the α subunit (29Weber J. Lee R.S.-F. Wilke-Mounts S. Grell E. Senior A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 6241-6247Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). When Argα365 at the noncatalytic site is changed to tyrosine, significant labeling of the α subunit is observed. This shift of labeling to α is not observed on substitution of phenylalanine at position 365 (29Weber J. Lee R.S.-F. Wilke-Mounts S. Grell E. Senior A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 6241-6247Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The x-ray crystal structures of F1 have confirmed the proximity of these aromatic residues to ATP bound at the catalytic and noncatalytic sites (21Abrahams J.P. Leslie A.G. Lutter R. Walker J.E. Nature. 1994; 370: 621-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (2764) Google Scholar, 22Bianchet M.A. Hullihen J. Pedersen P.L. Amzel L.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 11065-11070Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). These results suggest that reaction with 2-azido-[32P]ATP can be used to identify tyrosine residues in close proximity to bound nucleotides. Molecular modeling studies using the x-ray coordinates of F1; the sequence homology between the α, β, A, and B subunits; and energy minimization programs have predicted the presence of four aromatic residues (Phe452, Tyr532, Tyr535, and Phe538) near the adenine binding pocket at the catalytic site on the yeast V-ATPase A subunit (26MacLeod K.J. Vasilyeva E. Baleja J.D. Forgac M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 150-156Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Mutagenesis studies have indicated that alteration of these residues leads to significant changes in activity or affinity for ATP (26MacLeod K.J. Vasilyeva E. Baleja J.D. Forgac M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 150-156Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), but it is possible that these changes are the consequence of conformational changes rather than direct effects at the nucleotide binding site. To further test the proximity of these aromatic residues to the ATP-binding site, we have carried out photochemical labeling studies of the wild-type and mutant forms of the A subunit using 2-azido-[32P]ADP. Mutants in which all four residues were phenylalanine or in which single tyrosine residues were introduced were tested. We also wished to determine the role of the nucleotide binding sites in controlling dissociation of the V1 and V0domains. It has previously been shown that nucleotide binding activates dissociation of the V1 and V0 domainsin vitro (30Moriyama Y. Nelson N. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 3577-3582Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 31Arai H. Pink S. Forgac M. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 3075-3082Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 32Adachi I. Puopolo K. Marquez-Sterling N. Arai H. Forgac M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 967-973Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, reversible dissociation of V1 and V0 domains has been observed in vivo in yeast (33Kane P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17025-17032Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and insects (34Sumner J.P. Dow J.A. Early F.G. Klein U. Jager D. Wieczorek H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5649-5653Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). We have therefore addressed the role of nucleotide binding and activity in regulating in vivo and in vitro dissociation of the V-ATPase complex. Zymolyase 100T was obtained from Sekagaku America, Inc. Concanamycin A was obtained from Fluka Chemical Corp. Tran35S-label (a mixture of [35S]methionine and [35S]cysteine) and32Pi were purchased from ICN Biomedical. Leupeptin, aprotinin, and pepstatin were all purchased from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. Yeast extract, dextrose, peptone, and yeast nitrogen base were purchased from Difco. Zwittergent 3-14 was purchased from Calbiochem-Novabiochem Corp. Molecular biology reagents were from Promega and New England Biolabs. ATP and most other chemicals were purchased from Sigma. Yeast strain SF838–5Aα vma1Δ-8 (MATa, leu2–3, 112, ura3–52, ade6, vma1Δ::LEU2), used for integrations and subsequent biochemical characterization was a kind gift from Dr. Patricia Kane (Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, State University of New York, Syracuse). The plasmid pPK17–7, containing VMA1 lacking the entire VMA1-derived endonuclease (VDE) subcloned into the yeast shuttle vector pSEYC68 at BamHI andSalI sites (24Liu J. Kane P.M.

Yeast cells were grown in yeast extract-peptone-dextrose (YEPD) medium or in supplemented synthetic dextrose medium (SD). Mutagenesis was performed on the wild-type VMA1 cDNA using the Altered Sites II in vitro mutagenesis system (Promega) following the manufacturer's protocol. The full-length VMA1 cDNA with the spacer region looped out (35Kane P.M. Yamashiro C.T. Wolczyk D.F. Neff N. Goebl M. Stevens T.H. Science. 1990; 250: 651-657Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar) was cloned into pAlter-1 using BamHI and SalI sites. The mutagenesis oligonucleotides were as follows with the substitution sites underlined: Y532F/Y535F, CAAAATGGTTTCTCCACTTTTGATGCTTTC; *F452Y/Y532F/Y535F, GAAAGCATTACCCATCTATC; Y532F, CAACAAAATGGTTTCTCCACTTATG; Y535F, GGTTACTCCACTTTTGATGCTTTCTG; *F538Y/Y532F/Y535F, CTTTTGATGCTTA CTGTCCAATTTG; F452A, CAAAGAAAGCATGCCCCATCTATCAAC; Y532S, CAACAAAATGGTTCCTCCACTTATGATG; Y535S, GGTTACTCCACTTCTGATGCTTTCTG. Asterisk indicates that the mutants in which tyrosine residues were introduced at positions 452 or 538 were constructed in a background in which both Tyr532 and Tyr535 were converted to phenylalanine. All mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing using the dideoxy method. Cassettes containing each mutation were subcloned into a wild-type pAlterI/VMA1 plasmid that had not been subjected to mutagenesis using HpaI and SalI. The full-length mutant VMA1 cDNAs were then subcloned, along with wild-type VMA1 for a positive control, into the yeast integration vector YIp5 (New England Biolabs) using BamHI and SalI sites. Wild-type VMA1 in YIp5 (WT-VMA1) as a positive control, or vma1 mutant YIp5 plasmids were linearized with ApaI to target the integration of the constructs to the URA3 locus. Yeast cells SF838–5Aαvma1Δ-8 were transformed with the linearized constructs using the lithium acetate method (36Geitz D. St. Jean A. Woods R.A. Schiestl R.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 1425Crossref PubMed Scopus (2899) Google Scholar). The transformants were then selected on Ura− plates as described previously (37.Google Scholar). Chromosomal DNA was isolated from the transformed yeast cells and the VMA1 gene was amplified by a polymerase chain reaction. The presence of the site-directed mutations was confirmed by sequencing the polymerase chain reaction products. Growth phenotypes of the mutants were assessed on YEPD plates buffered with 50 mmKH2PO4 and 50 mm succinic acid to either pH 5.5 or pH 7.5. Plates containing 50 mmCaCl2 were buffered to pH 7.5 using 50 mmMES/MOPS (38Yamashiro C.T. Kane P.M. Wolczyk D.F. Preston R.A. Stevens T.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 3737-3749Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Yeast integrated with either wild-type plasmid (WT-VMA1) or vma1 mutant plasmids were cultured overnight in 1 liter of YEPD pH 5.5 to log phase. Vacuoles were isolated from the different strains as described previously (39Roberts C.J. Raymond K.K. Yamashiro C.T. Stevens T.H. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 644-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). For purification of the V-ATPase, vacuolar membranes were washed three times with 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and 1 mm EDTA, and solubilized in buffer (10 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 2 mmdithiothreitol) with 0.5% Zwittergent 3-14, and the V-ATPase was isolated by glycerol density gradient sedimentation on 20–50% glycerol gradients as described previously (40Kane P.M. Yamashiro C.T. Stevens T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 19236-19244Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). 2-azido-AMP was synthesized as described previously (41Czarnecki J.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1984; 800: 41-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) and was converted to 2-azido-[32P]ATP by 3-phosphoglycerate kinase and adenylate kinase (42Melese T. Boyer P.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 15398-15401Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). 2-Azido-AMP (3 μmol) were incubated in the following reaction overnight at room temperature at pH 7.7: 50 mm Tricine, pH 8.0, 100 μm EDTA, 2 mm MgCl2, 10 mmK2HPO4, 25 μm ADP, 200 μm NAD, 40 mm glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate, 15 mm pyruvate, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 47 μg/ml glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, 20 μg/ml lactate dehydrogenase, 20 μg/ml adenylate kinase, 27 μg/ml 3-phosphoglycerate kinase, and 500 μCi of32Pi. The phosphorylating enzymes were removed using a Centricon 10 concentrator (Amicon) for 1.5 h at 4 °C. 2-Azidoadenine nucleotides were separated by anion exchange using an Accell Plus QMA anion exchange column (Waters Corp.). Concentrations were determined by measuring the absorbance at 271 and 310 nm using the extinction coefficients of 10 and 7 mm−1cm−1, respectively. The peak fractions containing 2-azido-[32P]ATP were lyophilized and dissolved in buffer containing 50 mm Tricine, pH 8.0, 100 μmEDTA, 2 mm MgCl2, 10 mmK2HPO4. 2-Azido-[32P]ATP was converted to 2-azido-[32P]ADP by addition of glucose to a final concentration of 5 mm followed by addition of 20 units of hexokinase. The reaction was incubated at 25 °C for 3 h in the dark, and the hexokinase was removed using a Centricon 10 concentrator. V-ATPase purified on 20–50% glycerol gradients was concentrated 10–15-fold using Centricon 30 concentrators (Amicon) to a final concentration of 10–20 μg of protein/100 μl. Protein was incubated with 120 μm2-azido-[32P]ADP and 6 mm MgCl2, in the presence or absence of 5 mm ATP, for 20 min at 4 °C in the dark followed by irradiation of the sample with a ultraviolet lamp (9UVGL-25 Mineralight 254/366) at short wavelength at a distance of 1 cm at 4 °C for 20 min. Laemmli sample buffer was added to the samples followed by SDS-PAGE on a 10% acrylamide gel. The gel was incubated in 30% methanol and 7.5% acetic acid, dried, and autoradiography performed. Yeast strains WT-VMA1 and vma1 mutants were grown in SD-methionine-free medium overnight, converted to spheroplasts, and metabolically labeled with Tran35S-label (50 μCi/5 × 106 spheroplasts) for 60 min at 30 °C. At the end of the incubation, unlabeled methionine and cysteine were added to a final concentration of 0.33 mg/ml each. For the chase, spheroplasts were pelleted and resuspended in YEP media containing 1.2 m sorbitol alone, or YEP media with 1.2m sorbitol and 2% dextrose and incubated for 30 min at 30 °C. Spheroplasts were pelleted, washed, and lysed in solubilization buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, and 10% glycerol) with 1% C12E9, and protease inhibitors (1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin). The V-ATPase was cross-linked using dithiobis-succinimidylpropionate and immunoprecipitated using the monoclonal antibody 8B1-F3 against the yeast A subunit (Molecular Probes, Inc.), and protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE on a 12% acrylamide gel, fixed in 30% methanol and 7.5% acetic acid for 1 h, incubated in Enlightening solution (NEN Life Science Products) for 30 min, dried, and autoradiography performed. Vacuolar vesicles were washed three times with 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and 1 mm EDTA, and resuspended in buffer (10 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, and 10% glycerol). 30–50 μg of washed vacuoles were then incubated with or without 5 mm ATP and 6 mm MgCl2 for 10 min on ice. Potassium iodide was added to the vacuoles to a final concentration 300 mm, and the vesicles were incubated on ice for 60 min. Membranes were pelleted at 100,000 × gfor 30 min, and supernatants were precipitated with 12% trichloroacetic acid for 30 min on ice. The precipitated proteins were solubilized in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 8 murea, 5% SDS, 1 mm EDTA, 5% β-mercaptoethanol at 70 °C for 10 min, and subjected to SDS-PAGE using a 12% acrylamide gel. Dissociation of V1 was determined by Western blot analysis using the monoclonal antibody 8B1-F3 against the yeast V-ATPase A subunit (Molecular Probes, Inc.). Following SDS-PAGE, samples were transferred to nitrocellulose, and probed with the monoclonal antibody 8B1-F3, followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (Bio-Rad). Immunoblots were developed using a chemiluminescent detection method following the manufacturer's protocol from Kirkegaard and Perry Laboratories. ATPase activity was measured using a coupled spectrophotometric assay (39Roberts C.J. Raymond K.K. Yamashiro C.T. Stevens T.H. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 644-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar) in the absence or presence of 1 μm concanamycin A, a specific inhibitor of the V-ATPase (43Drose S. Bindseil K.U. Bowman E.J. Siebers A. Zeeck A. Altendorf K. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 3902-3906Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar). SDS-PAGE was carried out as described by Laemmli (44Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar), and silver staining was performed by the method of Oakley et al.

Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and determinations on purified enzyme included initial protein precipitation with 10% trichloroacetic acid. Site-directed mutations of the VMA1 cDNA encoding the yeast V-ATPase A subunit were constructed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The mutant vma1 cDNAs were subcloned into the yeast integration vector YIp5 and expressed in a vma1Δ strain in which the VMA1 gene was deleted. The aromatic residues suggested from molecular modeling studies to be in proximity to the adenine binding pocket at the catalytic site on the A subunit are Phe452, Tyr532, Tyr535, and Phe538. The following nomenclature was employed to simplify discussion of tyrosine and phenylalanine mutants at these positions. −Tyr refers to the double mutant in which the two endogenous tyrosine residues have been replaced by phenylalanine (Y532F/Y535F). Y452 refers to the triple mutant (F452Y/Y532F/Y535F) containing a tyrosine at position 452 but phenylalanines at the other three positions. Y535 refers to the single mutant (Y532F) containing a tyrosine at position 535 but phenylalanines at the other three positions. Y532 refers to the single mutant (Y535F) containing a tyrosine at position 532 but phenylalanines at the other three positions. Finally, Y538 refers to the triple mutant (Y532F/Y535F/F538Y) containing a tyrosine at position 538 but phenylalanines at the other three positions. All other mutations (i.e. Y532S, Y535S, etc.) refer to constructs containing only the indicated amino acid substitution. Deletion of genes encoding subunits of the V-ATPase results in a conditional lethal phenotype (35Kane P.M. Yamashiro C.T. Wolczyk D.F. Neff N. Goebl M. Stevens T.H.

Strains bearing these mutations are able to grow on medium buffered to acidic pH (5.0–5.5) but are unable to grow at neutral pH (7.5) or in neutral medium containing 50 mmCaCl2. Of the mutants tested, three showed altered growth at neutral pH. As previously reported, E286Q and F452A were both unable to grow at neutral pH (25Liu Q. Leng X.H. Newman P.R. Vasilyeva E. Kane P.M.

In addition, based on Western blot analysis of whole cell lysates and isolated vacuoles using the monoclonal antibody 8B1-F3 against the yeast V-ATPase A subunit, all of the vma1mutants tested showed normal levels of protein expression and V-ATPase assembly (data not shown). Table I summarizes the kinetic analysis of the vma1 mutants. Vacuoles were isolated from the wild-type WT-VMA1 and vma1 mutant strains and then solubilized and the V-ATPases purified by glycerol density gradient sedimentation as described under “Experimental Procedures.” ATPase activities of the purified enzymes were measured over a range of ATP concentrations"
https://openalex.org/W2000067936,"To explore the intracellular pathways activated by vasopressin receptors, the effects of arginine vasopressin (AVP) and its analogues mediating glycine (Gly)-induced Cl−currents (IGly) were examined in acutely dissociated rat hippocampal CA1 neurons using the whole-cell patch recording technique. AVP and its analogues inhibited IGly in a concentration-dependent manner. The inhibitory actions of AVP(4–9) (AVP metabolite) and NC-1900 (AVP(4–9) analogue) were reversed by a V1 receptor antagonist, or pretreatment with 1,2-bis(2-amino-5-fluorophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid. In contrast, these blocking procedures had no effect on the 1-desamino-8-d-AVP (DDAVP; V2 agonist) action. A V2 receptor antagonist did not block the inhibitory action of AVP(4–9) or NC-1900, but blocked that of DDAVP. The inhibitory action of AVP was completely blocked by the co-application of the V1 and V2 antagonists. The inhibitory action of NC-1900 was not affected by perfusion with a Ca2+-free external solution, but was strongly blocked by thapsigargin. The intracellular application of heparin or anti-inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate (IP3) also blocked the NC-1900 action. Furthermore, Ca2+/calmodulin (CaM) inhibitors blocked the NC-1900 action, while a CaM-dependent kinase II inhibitor and PKC modulators had no effect. 2′,5′-Dideoxyadenosine (an adenylate cyclase inhibitor), H-89, and Rp-cAMPS blocked the inhibitory actions of NC-1900 and DDAVP. These results suggest that the activation of the V1 receptor in the hippocampal neurons induces the production of IP3, which releases Ca2+ from the IP3-sensitive Ca2+ storage sites. The Ca2+ binds to CaM, resulting in the activation of Ca2+/CaM-sensitive adenylate cyclases. The activation of protein kinase A through the adenylate cyclase inhibits IGly.

Vasopressin receptors have been classified into two major subtypes, named V1 and V2 receptors, based on their intracellular transduction mechanisms. The V1receptor is associated with phosphoinositide (PI) turnover (2Kirk C.J. Michell R.H. Biochem. J. 1981; 194: 155-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), while the V2 receptor activates adenylate cyclase (3Jard S. Front. Horm. Res. 1985; 13: 89-104Crossref Google Scholar).

Autoradiographic ligand-binding studies found vasopressin receptors in the pyramidal cell layer of the hippocampus (6Biegon A. Terlou M. Voorhuis Th.D. De Kloet E.R. Neurosci.

The vasopressin receptor in the hippocampus has been shown to be the V1 subtype in histological studies using a 3H-labeled V1 antagonist (8Van Leeuwen F.W. Van der Beck E.M. Van Heerikhuize J.J.

Hippocampus. 1993; 3: 193-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Moreover, the possible existence of V2 receptor in the rat hippocampus has also been suggested at the mRNA level (10Hirasawa A. Nakayama Y. Ishiharada N. Honda K. Saito R. Tsujimoto G. Tanaka Y. Kamiya H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 205: 1702-1706Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar).

Nature. 1982; 296: 749-751Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). In addition, AVP has been shown to induce an increase of spike discharge in the hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons in studies using microelectrode techniques (12Mizuno Y. Oomura Y. Hori N. Carpenter D. Brain Res. 1984; 309: 241-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). In both electrophysiological (9Chen C. Brinton R.D. Shors T.J. Thompson R.F.

Brain Res. 1997; 760: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) studies, the effect of AVP was blocked by a selective V1 receptor antagonist. It has also been reported that AVP induced the production of IP3 through the V1 receptor in rat cultured hippocampal neurons (15Stephens L.R. Logan S.D. J. Neurochem. 1986; 46: 649-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 16Brinton R.D. Gonzalez T.M. Cheung W.S. Brain Res. 1994; 661: 274-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). Brinton and McEwen (17Brinton R.E. McEwen B.S. J. Neurosci. 1989; 9: 752-759Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) demonstrated that AVP potentiates the norepinephrine-induced cAMP accumulation in a calcium-dependent manner in the rat hippocampal slice preparation through the V1 receptor. It has been demonstrated that the activation of V1a receptor potentiated the V2 receptor-mediated cAMP accumulation in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells transfected with both receptor cDNAs (18Klingler C. Ancellin N. Barrault M.-B. Morel A. Corman B. Biochem. J. 1998; 330: 1023-1028Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). However, the specific mechanism by which cAMP accumulates as a consequence of V1 receptor activation has yet been elucidated for hippocampal neurons. The intracellular cAMP levels may be modified by calcium through regulation of the activity of some adenylate cyclase isoforms. Nine subtypes of adenylate cyclase have been identified by cloning and expression studies, and they have been divided into six subfamilies based on their functional properties and sequence similarities: type 1, type 2-like group (types 2, 4 and 7), type 3, type 5-like group (types 5 and 6), type 8, and type 9 (19Tang W.J.

The glycine (Gly)-induced response is modulated by either protein kinase A (PKA) or protein kinase C (PKC) (28Agopyan N. Tokutomi N. Akaike N.

Osipchuk Y.V. Vrublevsky S.V. Neurosci. Lett. 1988; 84: 271-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 35Shirasaki T. Klee M.R. Nakaye T. Akaike N.

Therefore, to explore the intracellular pathways activated by vasopressin receptors, we have examined the affects of AVP and its analogues on the Gly-induced inhibitory responses in acutely dissociated pyramidal neurons from the rat hippocampal CA1 region using the patch-clamp technique. Hippocanpal pyramidal neurons were acutely dissociated from the rat CA1 region, as described elsewhere (37Harata N. Wu J. Ishibashi H. Ono K. Akaike N. J. Physiol. 1997; 500: 673-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Briefly, 2–3-week-old Wistar rats were anesthetized with ether and decapitated. The brain was quickly removed from the skull and was sliced at a thickness of 400 μm with a microslicer (DTK-1000; Dosaka, Kyoto, Japan). The slices were then treated with Pronase (1 mg in 6 ml) for 15 min at 31 °C and subsequently with thermolysin (1 mg in 6 ml) under the same conditions. The CA1 region of the slice was removed by micropunching and mechanically triturated with fire-polished Pasteur pipettes in a 35-mm plastic culture dish (Primaria 3801; Becton Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, NJ) under a phase-contrast microscope (BH-2; Olympus, Tokyo, Japan). The dissociated CA1 neurons adhered to the bottom of the dish within 20 min. Electrical measurements were performed with the nystatin perforated patch recording technique (38Akaike N. Harata N. Jpn. J. Physiol. 1994; 44: 433-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). In some experiments, the conventional whole-cell patch recording mode was used (Fig. 6 C). The resistance between the recording electrode filled with the internal pipette solution and the reference electrode was 5–8 megohms. The current and voltage were measured with a patch-clamp amplifier (CEZ-2300; Nihon Kohden, Tokyo, Japan), filtered at 1 kHz (E-3201B; NF Electronic Instruments, Tokyo, Japan) and monitored on both an oscilloscope (VC-11; Nihon Kohden) and a pen recorder (RJG-4124; Nihon Kohden). The data were stored on videotapes after digitalization with a pulse-coded modulation processor (RP-880; NF Electronic Instruments). The membrane potential was held at −40 mV throughout the experiment, except when examining the current-voltage (I-V) relationships (Fig. 4 C). All experiments were performed at room temperature (22–24 °C).Figure 4Effect of NC-1900 on IGly.

(Saitama, Japan). Stock solutions of db-cAMP, IBMX, forskolin, and PMA were prepared in dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO) and diluted to their final concentrations in standard solution just before use. The final concentration of Me2SO was always less than 0.1%. It did not induce any ionic current and had no effect on the Gly-induced response at the concentrations used. The other drugs were dissolved in the standard external solution just before use. Drugs were applied by the “Y-tube system,” which enables a solution to exchange within 20 ms (39Murase K. Randic M. Shirasaki T. Nakagawa T. Akaike N. Brain Res. 1990; 525: 84-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). The data are presented as the mean ± S.E. The results were analyzed with the Student's t test, pairedt test, or Dunnett's multiple comparison test, and ap value of < 0.05 was considered to be significant. Rapid application of 10−4m Gly at 2-min intervals induced constant peak inward currents for 60 min at a holding potential (Vh ) of -40 mV under the voltage-clamp conditions. Strychnine, a competitive Gly receptor antagonist, inhibited strongly the Gly-induced current (IGly) at a concentration of 10−7m (Fig.1 B, a). AVP or DDAVP alone did not induce any noticeable current at concentrations up to 10−6m. AVP(4–9), a AVP metabolite in the brain (40Burbach J.P.H. Kovács G.L. De Wied D. Van Nispen J.W. Greven H.M. Science. 1983; 221: 1310-1312Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar), or NC-1900, a synthetic analogue of AVP(4–9), also did not induce currents. However, the IGly was gradually inhibited during the continuous application of these peptides for 10 min (Fig.1 A, a–d). The inhibition completely recovered to the control levels after washing out the peptides. Fig. 1 Bsummarized the inhibitory actions of AVP analogues and strychnine on Gly-induced response. The half-inhibition dose (IC50) for strychnine was 5.2 × 10−8m. The percentages of inhibition of the IGly by NC-1900, AVP(4–9), AVP, and DDAVP at a concentration of 10−6m were 46.4 ± 5.5% (n = 14), 31.2 ± 3.8% (n = 5), 29.2 ± 4.7% (n = 5), and 31.8 ± 6.8% (n = 4), respectively. NC-1900 was the most potent inhibitor. The block by strychnine appeared to reach steady state immediately. In contrast, AVP and its analogues required several minutes to attain steady state. The difference in time course suggests that AVP and its analogues act indirectly on the Gly receptor. To determine which vasopressin receptor subtypes mediate the inhibition of IGly, the effect of [Pmp1,Tyr(Me)2] AVP, a selective V1 receptor antagonist (41Kruszynski M. Lammek B. Manning M. Seto J. Haldar J. Sawyer W.H. J. Med. Chem. 1980; 23: 364-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar), was examined. Pretreatment with 10−5m[Pmp1,Tyr(Me)2] AVP alone induced no current and had no effect on IGly. However, the inhibitory actions of 10−6m NC-1900 and 10−6m AVP(4–9) on IGly were completely blocked by the pretreatment with the V1 antagonist (Fig.2 A, a andb). Fig. 2 B summarizes the blocking effects of the V1 antagonist on the inhibitory actions of AVP and its related peptides on IGly. In this figure, the independent points on the left-hand side (arrow) indicate the control percentage of inhibition of IGly by these peptide alone. The V1 receptor antagonist blocked the inhibitory actions of 10−6m NC-1900 and 10−6m AVP(4–9) in a concentration-dependent manner with a near-complete block at a concentration of 10−5m(p < 0.01; Dunnett's multiple comparison test). In contrast, the inhibitory effect of 10−6m AVP was only partially blocked (p < 0.05), while the inhibitory effect of DDAVP was not affected by the V1antagonist. To explore the contribution of V2 receptors, the effect of OPC-31260, a selective V2 receptor antagonist (42Yamamura Y. Ogawa H. Yamashita H. Chihara T. Miyamaoto H. Nakamura S. Onogawa T. Yamashita T. Hosokawa T. Mori T. Tominaga M. Yabuuchi Y. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1992; 105: 787-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar), was examined. Pretreatment with 10−6m OPC-31260 alone induced no current and had no effect on IGly. The inhibitory action of 10−6m DDAVP on IGly was completely blocked by pretreatment with OPC-31260 (Fig. 3 A, a), whereas the action of NC-1900 on IGly was not affected (the percentage of inhibition of IGly was still 48.3 ± 5.2%, n = 4) (Fig. 3 A, b). The concentration-inhibition relationships between the peptides and the V2 antagonist are shown in Fig. 3 B, in which the independent points on the left-hand side(arrow) indicate the control inhibition percentage of IGly by these peptides. The inhibitory action of 10−6m DDAVP on IGly was blocked in a concentration-dependent manner by OPC-31260, and the V2 antagonist considerably blocked the action of DDAVP at concentrations above 10−7m (Dunnett's multiple comparison test). The results indicate that the inhibitory action of DDAVP on IGly is mediated through the V2 receptor. The inhibitory action of 10−6m NC-1900 or 10−6m AVP(4–9) on IGly was not affected by the V2 receptor antagonist. The inhibitory action of 10−6mAVP was partially blocked by the V2 antagonist, but the co-application of 10−5m V1antagonist and 10−6m V2antagonist completely blocked this peptide action (Fig. 3 C). Since NC-1900 had the most potent inhibitory action on IGly, the concentration-response relationship was examined. All currents induced by Gly at various concentrations with or without 10−6m NC-1900 were normalized to the peak current induced by 10−4m Gly alone (asterisk in Fig.4 A). NC-1900 inhibited the maximum value of the concentration-response relationship for Gly without affecting the apparent KD (8.5 × 10−5m and 6.5 × 10−5m for with and without NC-1900, respectively) or the hill coefficient (1.01 and 1.02, respectively), indicating that the inhibition is non-competitive. Fig. 4 B (a andb) shows the I-V relationships for IGly in the presence or absence of 10−6m NC-1900. The reversal potential of the IGly(E Gly) was −19.0 ± 0.5 mV (n = 5) in the control and −18.7 ± 0.8 mV (n = 5) in the presence of 10−6m NC-1900. These E Gly values were close to the Cl− equilibrium potential (E Cl) of -21.0 mV (arrow) calculated from the Nernst equation based on the given external and internal Cl− concentrations (161 and 70 mm, respectively). The inhibition of IGly by NC-1900 did not show any voltage dependence. The desensitization rates also did not appear to vary with NC-1900 application (Fig. 4 B,a). Since the activation of the V1 receptor stimulates the hydrolysis of PI (2Kirk C.J. Michell R.H. Biochem. J. 1981; 194: 155-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) and results in the elevation of [Ca2+] i, the effect of [Ca2+] i on the IGly inhibitory actions of these peptides was examined. The CA1 neurons were loaded with 5 × 10−6mBAPTA-AM, a membrane-permeable Ca2+ chelator, for 2 h. The inhibitory action of 10−6m NC-1900 on IGly was completely abolished in BAPTA-AM-treated neurons (Fig. 5 A, a). The inhibition by 10−6m AVP(4–9) on IGly was also blocked in the BAPTA-AM-treated neurons (Fig.5 A, b). On the other hand, the inhibitory action of 10−6m AVP was only partially blocked in the BAPTA-AM-treated neurons, while that of 10−6m DDAVP was not affected at all (Fig. 5 A,c and d). Fig. 5 B summarizes the effect of BAPTA-AM for these peptide actions on IGly. The percentages of inhibition of NC-1900, AVP(4–9), AVP, and DDAVP in the BAPTA-AM-treated neurons were 9.9 ± 1.2% (n = 4), 6.8 ± 3.7% (n = 5), 17.2 ± 1.8% (n = 6), and 27.2 ± 1.7% (n = 4), respectively. The inhibitory effects of NC-1900, AVP(4–9) and AVP were significantly removed by BAPTA-AM treatment (p < 0.01 for NC-1900 and AVP(4–9), and p < 0.05 for AVP; Student's t test). Since the NC-1900 action on IGly through the V1 receptor was most potent among the examined peptides (Fig. 1), the following experiments were carried out. First, the Ca2+ dependence for the inhibitory action of NC-1900 on IGly was investigated. After the IGly was inhibited by the pretreatment with 10−6m NC-1900 in a standard external solution for 10 min, the external solution was changed to Ca2+-free external solution containing 2 mmEGTA. The inhibitory action of NC-1900 persisted (Fig.6 A), suggesting that extracellular Ca2+([Ca2+] o ) is not involved in the inhibition of IGly by NC-1900. A possible involvement of intracellular Ca2+ storage sites in the NC-1900 action was confirmed by following experiments. The application of 10−5m thapsigargin, a Ca2+-ATPase inhibitor which depletes Ca2+ in the IP3-sensitive Ca2+ storage sites (IICR), did not affect the peak amplitude of IGly, but facilitated slightly the desensitization phase of IGly· The inhibitory action of NC-1900 on IGly was completely blocked by the pretreatment with thapsigargin (n = 4) (Fig.6 B, a), suggesting the Ca2+ release from IICR in the presence of NC-1900. Ryanodine depletes the Ca2+ release from caffeine-sensitive intracellular Ca2+ storage sites (CICR). Even after the 10−2m caffeine-induced outward current was considerably reduced by a continuous perfusion with 10−6mryanodine, the inhibitory effect of NC-1900 on IGly was still observed, though the inhibition ratio of IGly by NC-1900 was reduced from 44.3 ± 4.6% of control (n = 5) to 35.0 ± 2.3% (n = 4) in the presence of ryanodine (Fig. 6 B, b). In the conventional whole-cell patch recording mode, the inhibitory action of IGly by NC-1900 was also observed (42.4 ± 5.6%, n = 5) (Fig. 6 C, open circles). Therefore, the direct modification of IP3 was examined by the intracellular perfusion with heparin (5 mg ml−1) or anti-IP3 (5 μg ml−1) through the recording patch pipette (43Liu X. Farley J.M. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1996; 277: 796-804PubMed Google Scholar). The inhibitory action of NC-1900 on IGly was completely blocked by either heparin or anti-IP3 (closed circle and open triangle, respectively), suggesting that IP3 plays an important role in the IGly inhibition by NC-1900. These results strongly support the hypothesis that Ca2+ release from the IICR is involved in the inhibitory action of NC-1900 on IGly. In order to clarify the signal transduction pathway following the intracellular free Ca2+ on the NC-1900 action, the possible contribution of Ca2+/CaM and CaM-dependent kinase II was investigated. W-7, trifluoperazine (TFP), and chlorpromazine (CPZ) are known Ca2+/CaM inhibitors. The inhibitory action of NC-1900 on IGly was blocked in a concentration-dependent fashion by treatment with 10−5m W-7, TFP, or CPZ, although these compounds alone had no effect on the IGly (Fig.7, A, a–c, andB). In Fig. 7 B, the open circle represents the percentage of inhibition of the IGly by 10−6m NC-1900 in the absence of these inhibitors. W-5 used as a negative control for W-7 had no effect. On the other hand, 10−6m KN-62, a potent CaM-dependent kinase II inhibitor, did not affect the inhibitory action of NC-1900 on IGly (the inhibition of IGly was 41.7 ± 7.9%, n = 8) (Fig.7 A, d). The results indicate that Ca2+/CaM is involved in the inhibition of IGlyby NC-1900. The hydrolysis of PI stimulated by the activation of V1 receptor produces second messengers such as IP3 and diacylglycerol (DAG), which activate PKC. The PKC would then phosphorylate the Gly receptor and modulates Gly response (30Nishizaki T. Ikeuchi Y. Brain Res. 1995; 687: 214-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 31Schonrock B.

Integrase (IN)1 is the enzyme responsible for many of the processes leading to genomic insertion. Because genomic insertion is an essential step in the life cycle of retroviruses, IN has been the focus of intense study (1Bushman F.D. Fujiward T. Craigie R. Science. 1990; 249: 1555-1558Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar, 2Katz R.A. Skalka A.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 133-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar). Both the full-length primary structure (3Andrake M. Skalka A.M. J. Biol.

Full-length, wild type HIV-I IN exhibits limited solubility in aqueous solvents, making it difficult to conduct solution studies with this protein (6Jenkins T.M. Engelman A. Ghirlando R. Craigie R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7712-7718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). However, wild type, full-length ASV IN is relatively soluble, making it a more practical protein for studying its aqueous solution behavior (7Jones K.S. Coleman J. Merkel G.W. Laue T.M. Skalka A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16037-16040Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). ASV IN has a monomer molecular weight of 31,750 (8Grandgenett D.P. Mumm S.R. Cell. 1990; 60: 3-4Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Structural analyses suggest that its catalytic core is similar to that of HIV-I IN (5Maignan S. Guilloteau J.P. Zhou-Liu Q. Clement-Mella C. Mikol V. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 282: 359-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). Furthermore, ASV IN and HIV-I IN are both members of a superfamily of polynucleotidyl transferases that show similar structure and, presumably, use similar mechanisms of catalysis (3Andrake M. Skalka A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19633-19636Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). All studies to date indicate that self-assembly is required for IN activity (3Andrake M. Skalka A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19633-19636Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Studies by Jones, et al. (7Jones K.S. Coleman J. Merkel G.W. Laue T.M. Skalka A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16037-16040Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) showed that ASV IN formed dimers and tetramers in 50 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 750 mm NaCl, and 2 mm βME. Other studies have demonstrated that enzymatically active fragments of ASV IN and HIV-I IN also self-associate (3Andrake M. Skalka A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19633-19636Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar) and that assembly is required for activity. In addition, a more soluble, mutant, full-length HIV-I IN has been isolated that exhibits a dimer-tetramer equilibrium when examined in 25 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 1 m NaCl, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA, and 10% (w/v) glycerol (6Jenkins T.M. Engelman A. Ghirlando R. Craigie R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7712-7718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). To date, there is no crystal structure available for full-length ASV IN. However, partial proteolysis experiments, deletion mutation results, and sequence similarity with other retroviral integrases, retrotransposons, and bacterial insertion elements suggest that there are three distinct domains in full-length ASV IN: the N-terminal, central core, and C-terminal domains (3Andrake M. Skalka A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19633-19636Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Structural analysis reveals that both the central core and C-terminal domains form dimers (9Eijkelenboom A.P.A.M. Lutzke R.A.P. Boelens R. Plasterk R.H.A. Kaptein R. Hard K. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 807-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar, 10Lubkowski J. Yang F. Alexandratos J. Merkel G. Katz R. Gravuver K. Skalka A.M. Wlodawer A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32685-32689Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). All three domains have been implicated in the self-association of the full-length proteins. The N-terminal domain contains an HCC, Zn2+ finger motif, and there is evidence that Zn2+ promotes self-association and alters the assembly stoichiometry of mutant, full-length HIV-I IN (11Lee S.P. Xiao J. Knutson J.R. Lewis M.S. Han M.K. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 173-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Deletion mutations indicate that the C-terminal domain is necessary for tetramer formation (6Jenkins T.M. Engelman A. Ghirlando R. Craigie R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7712-7718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). However, there is no convincing evidence for which domain interfaces are responsible for dimer formation and which are responsible for tetramer formation. The aim of this study is to better characterize the self-association of wild type, full-length ASV IN, and in so doing, to contribute to a better understanding of IN function. Here we report the effects of pH, ionic strength, cation type, and glycerol concentration on full-length, wild type ASV IN dimer and tetramer formation. All of these solvent properties affect the self-association significantly, indicating that care must be taken when comparing published results acquired under different conditions. Furthermore, the results suggest that the electrostatic contributions to dimer and tetramer formation are very different, with charge-charge repulsion opposing dimer formation, and favorable electrostatic interactions (e.g. dipole-dipole) favoring tetramer formation. ASV integration protein (IN) was purified as described previously (12Terry R. Soltis D. Katzman M. Cobrinik D. Leis J. Skalka A.M. J. Virol. 1988; 62: 2358-2365Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Protein was stored at −20 °C in a buffer of 50 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 0.5 m NaCl, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm EDTA, and 40% glycerol. Sterile Centrex cellulose acetate columns for the centrifugal gel exchange were purchased from Schleicher and Schuell, Keene, NH. Sephadex G-25 beads were purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Anhydrous glycerol, 99.6%, was purchased from the Ultrapure Bioreagent line of J. T. Baker. All other buffer components were ultra-pure or reagent grade. Buffer exchanges for all experiments were performed by centrifugal gel chromatography (13Christopherson R.I. Jones M.E. Finch L.R. Anal. Biochem. 1979; 100: 184-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), with the initial eluant used as the optical reference. Protein dilutions were made with the buffer used to prepare the gel column. Sedimentation equilibrium experiments were conducted in the Beckman Model E analytical ultracentrifuge at a temperature of 23.3 °C (14Pharmacia Gel Filtration and Practice. Rahms I Lund, Sweden1985Google Scholar) with an on-line Rayleigh interferometer (15Laue T.M. Rapid Precision Interferometry for the Analytical Ultracentrifuge. Ph.D. thesis. University of Connecticutt, Storrs, CT1981Google Scholar) using a pulsed laser diode light source at 670 nm. Rotor speeds for all experiments were 20,000, 24,000, 28,000, and 36,000 rpm. Either an AN-D (2 hole), AN-F (4 hole), or AN-G (6 hole) rotor was used. Four solution/solvent pairs were examined in each cell using a 12-mm thick charcoal-filled epon or Kel-F short column centerpiece (16Yphantis D.A. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1960; 88: 586-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar, 17Laue T.M. Short Column Equilibrium Sedimentation Analysis. Applications Data Note for Beckman Instruments, Palo Alto, CA1991Google Scholar) with sapphire windows. Experiments at 4 and 37 °C were conducted in a Beckman XLI analytical ultracentrifuge. Protein was prepared by centrifugal buffer exchange into 500 mm KCl, 20 mm Tris (pH 8.0), and 2 mm βME. Equilibrium experiments were carried out using the absorbance optical system (280 nm), 4-hole titanium rotor, 6-channel charcoal epon centerpieces, and fused silica windows. Data were acquired as the average of five absorbance measurements at a radial spacing of 0.002 cm and at rotor speeds of 20,000, 24,000, and 28,000 rpm. All protein solutions were spun in a high speed Beckman microfuge for 5 min to remove any particulate matter prior to cell loading, and serial dilutions for short column experiments were performed as described (17Laue T.M. Short Column Equilibrium Sedimentation Analysis. Applications Data Note for Beckman Instruments, Palo Alto, CA1991Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were estimated either using the extinction coefficient at 280 nm of 1.83 ml/mg·cm as determined by the tyrosine and tryptophan content of the protein (18Wetlaufer D.B. Adv. Protein Chem. 1962; 17: 303-390Crossref Scopus (796) Google Scholar) or using the “hinge point” method (19Liu J. Laue T.M. Choi H.U. Tang L.H. Rosenberg L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28366-28373Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Equilibrium was established according to the method of Yphantis (20Yphantis D.A. Biochemistry. 1964; 3: 297-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (2019) Google Scholar) by subtracting consecutive interference scans of the cell containing the highest viscosity sample. The average equilibrium time for solutions without glycerol was 1.5 h using short column centerpieces and 15 h using 6-channel centerpieces. When high viscosity samples were examined, centrifugation at each speed was conducted for 24 h (short column centerpieces) before equilibrium was checked using consecutive scans made at least 1 h apart. Buffer densities were calculated from the density increments and corrected to 23.3 °C as described (21Laue T.M. Shah B.D. Ridgeway T.M. Pelletier S.L. Harding S.E. Horton J.C. Rowe A.J. Analytical Ultracentrifugation in Biochemistry and Polymer Science. Royal Society of Chemistry, London1992Google Scholar). A calculated partial specific volume, v̄, of ASV IN of 0.7321ml/g based on amino acid composition was used (21Laue T.M. Shah B.D. Ridgeway T.M. Pelletier S.L. Harding S.E. Horton J.C. Rowe A.J. Analytical Ultracentrifugation in Biochemistry and Polymer Science. Royal Society of Chemistry, London1992Google Scholar, 22Durschlag H. Hinz H.-J. Thermodynamic Data for Biochemistry and Bio/Technology. Springer-Verlag, New York1986Google Scholar). However, for multicomponent solvents, the isopotential partial specific volume, φ′, and not v̄ must be used for data analysis. There was insufficient protein to determine φ′ experimentally. Accordingly, the effects of salt and glycerol on the v̄ of other proteins were used to estimate φ′. An approximately linear increase in φ′ is expected with both salt (0–1 m) and glycerol (0–40% by volume) (22Durschlag H. Hinz H.-J. Thermodynamic Data for Biochemistry and Bio/Technology. Springer-Verlag, New York1986Google Scholar). The worst case in the experiments reported here (40% glycerol, 0.5 m NaCl) would be expected to increase v̄ by 0.015 ml/g. The effect of protein concentration on φ′ is negligible at the concentrations used and was ignored. Data from the ultracentrifuge experiments were edited as described previously (19Liu J. Laue T.M. Choi H.U. Tang L.H. Rosenberg L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28366-28373Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and analyzed using nonlinear least squares (NONLIN) methods (23Johnson M.L. Correia J.J. Yphantis D.A. Halvorson H.R. Biophys. J. 1981; 36: 575-588Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (778) Google Scholar) to provide fitting parameters and estimates of the 95% confidence interval. A model was considered to be correct if it provided an acceptable variance of fit and random distribution of residuals. If more than one model fit these criteria, the model chosen was the simplest one (23Johnson M.L. Correia J.J. Yphantis D.A. Halvorson H.R. Biophys. J. 1981; 36: 575-588Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (778) Google Scholar, 24Laue T.M. Johnson A.E. Esmon C.T. Yphantis D.A. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 1339-1348Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Because of the lower precision afforded by the short solution columns used in these studies, it was not possible to extract the monomer molecular weight and multiple association constants routinely. Accordingly, association constants were determined using a model that assumed a known monomer molecular weight of 31,700 and a v̄ of 0.7321 ml/g, with the buoyancy adjusted for the solvent density. For the cases where the monomer molecular weight and association constants could be estimated simultaneously, the monomer molecular weights were within 12% of the expected value. Furthermore, adjusting the assumed buoyant monomer molecular weight for an uncertaintly in v̄ of ± 0.015 ml/g resulted in changes in the association constants that fell within the confidence interval when the analysis was conducted using v̄ = 0.7321 ml/g. Conversion from fringes to weight concentration was performed using a specific refractive increment of 3.333 fringes/mg/ml or an extinction coefficient of 1.83 ml/mg·cm. Association constants were calculated as described previously (24Laue T.M. Johnson A.E. Esmon C.T. Yphantis D.A. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 1339-1348Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The dimer-tetramer association constant (K 2↔4) was calculated asK 2↔4 =K 1↔4/K 21↔2, where K 1↔4 is the measured association constant describing the monomer-tetramer assembly andK 1↔2 is the corresponding constant for the monomer-dimer assembly. The confidence intervals forK 2↔4 were calculated using the worst case combination of the intervals for K 1↔4 andK 2↔4. The reciprocal of the association constants was used to calculate dissociation energies, ΔGn↔m=−RT lnKn↔mEquation 1 where n↔m is either 2↔1 or 4↔2, as appropriate. Previous studies have shown that full-length ASV IN assembly can be modeled as a reversible monomer-dimer-tetramer equilibrium (7Jones K.S. Coleman J. Merkel G.W. Laue T.M. Skalka A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16037-16040Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Except in solutions where the glycerol concentration exceeded 8%, this same model provided the best fit to the data (25Coleman J.L. The Association Properties of Retroviral Integration Protein Ph.D. thesis. University of New Hampshire, Durham, NH1993Google Scholar). At glycerol concentrations exceeding 8%, only the dimer-tetramer equilibrium could be characterized (below). The solubility of IN was determined by the “hinge-point” method (19Liu J. Laue T.M. Choi H.U. Tang L.H. Rosenberg L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28366-28373Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) in solvents containing varying concentrations of either Na+ or K+. The solubility increases as the ionic strength increases for both cations (Fig. 1). However, at all ionic strengths, ASV IN is more soluble in K+-containing than in Na+-containing buffers. These results suggest that electrostatic contributions are important to ASV IN aggregation. To explore this possibility further, sedimentation equilibrium experiments were undertaken to assess the effect of varying salt concentration and pH on ASV IN self-association. Short column sedimentation equilibrium experiments were conducted to determine ΔG 4↔2 and ΔG 2↔1 as a function of salt concentration, using either Na+ or K+-containing solvents (Fig. 2). For both cations, there is an overall strengthening of dimer formation and weakening of tetramer formation as the salt concentration is increased. These effects appear to saturate, with both dissociation energies becoming nearly constant at salt concentrations above 0.5 m for either cation. The solubility limit of ASV IN precluded analysis of self-association in the ultracentrifuge at physiological salt concentrations. At the lowest ionic strength, however, tetramer formation is the energetically favored species for either cation. These results suggest that tetramer would be the favored species at physiological salt concentrations. At higher salt concentrations, both dimer and tetramer formation are stronger in Na+-containing than in K+-containing solvents. Taken together with the solubility results, these data suggest that tetrameric ASV IN is less soluble than either monomer or dimer under these conditions. The charge per monomer of ASV IN estimated from its amino acid composition is about +12e at pH 8.4, rising almost linearly to +20e at pH 6.1. Thus, a change in the association behavior might be expected as the pH is varied. To test this, ΔG 2↔1 and ΔG 4↔2were determined over a pH range of 6.1 to 8.4. The free energy of both dimer and tetramer formation were found to be nearly constant, changing only by a few kJ/mol as the pH is increased from 6.1 to 8.4 (Fig.3). These results indicate that ionic strengths of 500 mm or greater are sufficient to suppress electrostatic effects. Previous work at ionic strengths well below 500 mm has shown that both the full-length ASV and its catalytic core are essentially enzymatically inactive at pH 6, probably because of a small structural rearrangement (10Lubkowski J. Yang F. Alexandratos J. Merkel G. Katz R. Gravuver K. Skalka A.M. Wlodawer A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32685-32689Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). To further determine how the self-association of the IN is affected by salt concentration at lower pH, the salt dependence of ΔG 2→1 and ΔG 4↔2 were determined at pH 6.1 (Fig.4). In general, the protein is more soluble at lower ionic strengths at this lower pH, possibly because of the higher net charge per IN monomer, allowing studies at lower salt concentrations. While the overall dependence of the self-association on salt concentration (Fig. 4) is similar to that observed at pH 8.4 (Fig.2), at pH 6.1 tetramer is significantly more stable in KCl than NaCl. Furthermore, at physiological KCl concentrations, tetramer is the clearly the favored oligomer at pH 6.1. Many studies of both ASV and HIV-I IN include varying amounts of glycerol in the solvent (6Jenkins T.M. Engelman A. Ghirlando R. Craigie R. J. Biol.

To determine the effect glycerol might have on ASV self-association, a series of experiments were conducted at pH 8.4 in buffer containing 500 mm NaCl and varying amounts of glycerol (Fig.5). The monomer-dimer equilibrium could be observed only at glycerol concentrations of less than 8%. At higher glycerol concentrations, there was insufficient monomer to detect the monomer-dimer equilibrium, and only the dimer-tetramer association was characterized. Remarkably, the dimer-tetramer equilibrium is virtually unaffected by glycerol concentrations as high as 40%. The fact that the monomer-dimer and dimer-tetramer equilibria exhibit such different sensitivities to glycerol strongly suggests that solvation effects are very different for these two assembly steps. Distinctly different effects are observed on ΔG 2↔1 and ΔG 4↔2when these dissociation energies are determined in solvents containing different cations at 250 mm (Fig.6). The cation species are arranged in this figure in increasing order of electrostatic shielding potential. Both ΔG 2↔1 and ΔG 4↔2 exhibit clear trends, with dimer formation being strengthened slightly, while tetramer formation is weakened considerably, as the cationic shielding potential increases. These results are in accord with the ionic strength effects (Figs. 2 and 4) and indicate that electrostatic interactions contribute measurably and in an opposite fashion to IN dimer and tetramer formation. The more pronounced effect of shielding potential on tetramer formation suggests a larger electrostatic contribution to this interaction than to dimer formation. When examined in 500 mm KCl at pH 8.4, there were only small increases in ΔG 2↔1 and ΔG 4↔2 as the temperature was raised from 4 to 37 °C (Fig. 7). This suggests that either enthalpic contributions to assembly are small or that there is significant enthalpic/entropic compensation in both assembly steps. The self-association of ASV IN has been examined in a variety of solvent conditions. The assembly was described satisfactorily as a freely reversible monomer-dimer-tetramer equilibrium, except in solvents containing >8% v/v glycerol, where only the dimer-tetramer equilibrium was observed. As these data show, there are significant changes in the free energies of both steps of assembly as the solvent conditions are varied. Of particular note is the rather dramatic, and opposite, effect that increasing salt concentration has on ΔG 2↔1 and ΔG 4↔2 (Figs. 2 and 4), as well as in the different response of ΔG 2↔1 and ΔG 4↔2 to changes in cation shielding potential (Fig. 6). Qualitatively, the salt-dependent increase in ΔG 2↔1 (Fig. 2 and 4) with increasing salt concentration is in accord with dimer formation being opposed by charge-charge repulsion between monomers. At the same time the decrease in ΔG 4↔2 with increased salt concentration suggests that electrostatic interactions favor tetramer formation. However, the shape of these curves, particularly their nearly mirror image nature and the apparent saturation of ΔG 2↔1 and ΔG 4↔2at high salt concentrations, suggest that either specific ion binding or a less specific electrostatically dependent rearrangement in the protein structure may occur. In an attempt to distinguish between these two possibilities, ΔG 2↔1 and ΔG 4↔2 were measured at a fixed ionic strength, but using cations of different size and thus different shielding potentials (Fig. 6). In this figure, the trends in ΔG 2↔1 and ΔG 4↔2as the shielding potential is varied are the same as those seen when the ionic strength is varied. This result suggests that the effects are more a consequence of general electrostatic behavior than they are because of specific ion binding. Varying the shielding potential has a greater effect on ΔG 4↔2 than it does on ΔG 2↔1, which suggests that there is a greater electrostatic contribution to ΔG 4↔2than there is on ΔG 2↔1 (Fig. 6). Consistent with this view is the minimal effect of glycerol on ΔG 4↔2 (Fig. 5), as might be expected for an interaction that is driven largely by electrostatics and is less dependent on solvation effects. By contrast, ΔG 2↔1 increases substantially with glycerol concentration, as might be expected for an interaction in which solvation effects and buried surface area are important (35Gekko K. Timasheff S.N. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 4667-4676Crossref PubMed Scopus (1111) Google Scholar). Jenkins, et al. (6Jenkins T.M. Engelman A. Ghirlando R. Craigie R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7712-7718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar) have described the self-association properties of a mutant HIV-I IN. In accord with our results on the effect of glycerol (Fig. 5), they observed only a dimer-tetramer equilibrium at 4 °C in 10% glycerol, 25 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 1 m NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 1 mm EDTA. Although none of our solvent conditions exactly match these, comparison with our results is invited. They report a tetramer to dimer dissociation constant of 2.2 × 10−5m, which yields a tetramer dissociation energy of 24.7 kJ/mol. This is within the confidence interval for what we observe, which is 22.0 kJ/mol (with a 95% confidence interval of 18.6 to 24.9 kJ/mol) for ASV IN in 1 m NaCl (pH 8.4), at 23.3 °C in the absence of glycerol (Fig. 2). That temperature (Fig.7) (pH) (Fig. 3) and glycerol (Fig. 5) have little effect on tetramer formation in ASV IN suggests that these variables may have similarly weak effects on HIV-I IN assembly. Nuclear magnetic resonance analysis reveals that the C-terminal domain of HIV-I IN forms dimers (9Eijkelenboom A.P.A.M. Lutzke R.A.P. Boelens R. Plasterk R.H.A. Kaptein R. Hard K. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 807-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). Furthermore, Jenkins, et al.(6Jenkins T.M. Engelman A. Ghirlando R. Craigie R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7712-7718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar) have demonstrated that a mutant HIV-I IN lacking the C-terminal domain is unable to form tetramers. Although it is tempting to ascribe the energy of tetramer formation to the contact area between the C-terminal domains, our data suggest that, for full-length ASV IN, tetramer formation may be driven largely by favorable electrostatic interactions and so may reflect more global properties of the protein. Both HIV-I and ASV IN contain an HHCC, Zn2+ finger motif near their N terminus (3Andrake M. Skalka A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19633-19636Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Lee, et al. (11Lee S.P. Xiao J. Knutson J.R. Lewis M.S. Han M.K. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 173-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar) have shown that Zn2+ promotes self-association of mutant, full-length HIV-I IN and that the HHCC motif is required for this effect. The addition of 10 μm Zn2+ to wild type, full-length ASV IN in 500 mm KCl, 20 mm Tris, 2 mmβME (pH 8.4) resulted in the formation of aggregates of indeterminate stoichiometry that were not in freely reversible equilibrium with lower order oligomers (data not shown). The aggregation precluded accurate analysis of ΔG 2↔1 and ΔG 4↔2 in these samples. Analysis of ASV IN H9N, in which a point mutation was made in the HHCC motif, showed a weakening of ΔG 2↔1 by ∼6 kJ/mol and a strengthening of ΔG 4↔2 by ∼5 kJ/mol (25Coleman J.L. The Association Properties of Retroviral Integration Protein Ph.D. thesis. University of New Hampshire, Durham, NH1993Google Scholar). It is not possible to interpret such observations further since self-association is a function of the entire protein structure and is sensitive to the surroundings of the protein.

Annu. Rev. Genet. 1994; 28: 95-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 2Kramer J.M. Riddle D.L. The Nematode C. elegans II. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1997Google Scholar). The cuticle collagens all have similar domain structures (3Kramer J.M. FASEB J. 1994; 8: 329-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). The central Gly-X-Y repeat domain contains two to four interruptions of non-Gly-X-Y sequence and is flanked by three cysteines on the amino side and two cysteines on the carboxyl side. The precise positions of these cysteine residues differs in different subfamilies of the cuticle collagen genes. The amino-terminal domain contains four short conserved stretches of amino acids that are referred to as homology blocks A-D. The carboxyl-domain is generally short and contains cysteine and tyrosine residues, the positions of which are generally conserved within but not between subfamilies. With a few exceptions, the cuticle collagen genes are predicted to encode polypeptides of about 30 kDa. However, reductive extraction of cuticles results in collagen molecules that migrate with apparent molecular masses from 90 to over 200 kDa (4Cox G.N. Kusch M. Edgar R.S. J. Cell Biol. 1981; 90: 7-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar, 5Cox G.N. Staprans S. Edgar R.S. Dev. Biol. 1981; 86: 456-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). The unexpectedly low mobility of the cuticle collagens is due to cross-linking between chains by di-, tri-, and/or isotri-tyrosine residues (6Fujimoto D. Horiuchi K. Hirama M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1981; 99: 637-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 7Fetterer R.H. Rhoads M.L. Urban J.F. J. Parasitol. 1993; 79: 160-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). These cross-links are non-reducible and result in the formation of multimers of the collagen chains. Mutations in C. elegans cuticle collagens can cause a variety of gross morphological defects, including dumpy (Dpy,1 short and fat), long (Lon, long and thin), roller (Rol, helically twisted), and abnormal tail structure (Tal, defective tail structure) (1Kramer J.M. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1994; 28: 95-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 2Kramer J.M. Riddle D.L. The Nematode C. elegans II. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1997Google Scholar). Roller mutants can be twisted in either a left-handed (LRol) or right-handed (RRol) helix, but all animals carrying a particular mutation show the same handedness. Different mutations in the sqt-1 androl-6 cuticle collagen genes can cause Dpy, Tal, RRol, or LRol phenotypes (8Kramer J.M. Johnson J.J. Edgar R.S. Basch C. Roberts S. Cell. 1988; 55: 555-565Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 9Kramer J.M. French R.P. Park E.-C. Johnson J.J. Mol. Cell.

Genetics. 1993; 135: 1035-1045Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). sqt-1 and rol-6 are members of the same cuticle collagen subfamily (3Kramer J.M. FASEB J. 1994; 8: 329-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), are expressed at the same developmental stages (11Park Y.-S. Kramer J.M. Dev. Biol. 1994; 163: 112-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), and equivalent mutations in them cause similar phenotypes (10Kramer J.M. Johnson J.J. Genetics. 1993; 135: 1035-1045Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12Yang J. Kramer J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2722-2730Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Genetic interactions betweensqt-1 and rol-6 have been described which suggest that the SQT-1 and ROL-6 collagen chains may interact in some manner (10Kramer J.M. Johnson J.J. Genetics. 1993; 135: 1035-1045Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13Kusch M. Edgar R.S. Genetics. 1986; 113: 621-639Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Null alleles, that result in the compete loss of SQT-1 or ROL-6 collagen from the cuticle, have only small effects, resulting in Tal or slight Dpy phenotypes, respectively (10Kramer J.M. Johnson J.J. Genetics. 1993; 135: 1035-1045Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, the presence of abnormal SQT-1 or ROL-6 can cause severe morphological defects. Alterations of conserved amino acids in the amino or carboxyl non-Gly-X-Y domains of sqt-1 or rol-6result in strong Rol or Dpy phenotypes. Several mutations were identified in Homology Block A, which has a consensus of Arg1-X 2-X 3-Arg4-Gln5. Substitution of Arg4 with His in rol-6 causes a recessive RRol phenotype, and cysteine substitutions for Arg1 or Arg4 of sqt-1 and Arg4 of rol-6 cause dominant or semi-dominant RRol phenotypes (10Kramer J.M. Johnson J.J. Genetics. 1993; 135: 1035-1045Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The same Arg4 to Cys substitution in the dpy-10 cuticle collagen gene causes a dominant LRol phenotype (14Levy A.D. Yang J. Kramer J.M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1993; 4: 803-817Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Site-directed mutagenesis of HBA and phenotypic analysis in transgenic animals (12Yang J. Kramer J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2722-2730Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) showed that Arg1 and Arg4 were the critical residues in this region. Substitution with Lys allowed for apparently normal function, but other substitutions resulted in RRol phenotypes. The spacing of these required basic residues suggested that HBA could function as the cleavage site for a subtilisin-like protease(s) (15Barr P.J. Cell. 1991; 66: 1-3Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (555) Google Scholar). A second class of mutations were identified in the carboxyl non-Gly-X-Y domain of sqt-1, where the loss of one of the two conserved cysteine residues resulted in a recessive LRol phenotype (10Kramer J.M. Johnson J.J. Genetics. 1993; 135: 1035-1045Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Site-directed mutagenesis of these two cysteines insqt-1 and rol-6 showed that alteration of either cysteine results in a LRol phenotype, although the phenotype is weaker for rol-6 than sqt-1. To analyze the effects of these mutations on the SQT-1 polypeptide we have generated antibodies specific for the SQT-1 collagen chain. Here we present evidence supporting the suggestion that HBA is a protease cleavage site and that the RRol mutations inhibit cleavage at that site. We also present evidence that the LRol cysteine substitutions interfere with tyrosine-based cross-linking of the SQT-1 cuticle collagen. General C. elegansmaintenance and handling were performed as described (16Brenner S. Genetics. 1974; 77: 71-94Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The following strains were used in these experiments:sqt-1(e1350,sc1,sc13,sc113,sc103); rol-6(su1006,e187,n1178); rol-6(n1178)sqt-1(e1350);rol-6(n1178)sqt-1(sc13); daf-2(e1368) (10Kramer J.M.

Genetics. 1980; 95: 317-339Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Animals of mixed developmental stages were grown on SNGM plates at 20 °C. Populations were watched closely to ensure that larval stage animals represented at least 70% of the total at harvest. A low percentage of adult animals in the population was critical because SQT-1 becomes highly cross-linked in adult cuticles and cannot be efficiently extracted. To isolate cuticles, animals were washed with M9 buffer and resuspended in 5 volumes of sonication buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride). The suspension was sonicated until the bodies of most animals were broken. Animal fragments were collected by centrifugation at 300 × g for 4 min and washed once with sonication buffer. The pelleted fragments were resuspended in 1 ml of ST buffer (1% SDS, 0.125 m Tris, pH 6.8), boiled for 2 min, and incubated for 5 min at room temperature. The cuticle fragments were pelleted and washed again with ST buffer. Cuticle proteins were extracted by boiling the cleaned cuticles in ST buffer containing 5% freshly added β-mercaptoethanol for 2 min followed by several hours of agitation at room temperature. Soluble proteins were transferred to fresh tubes after centrifugation and stored at −20 °C. Antisera numbers 483 and 1687 were raised against the synthetic peptides s1c and s1f derived from SQT-1. The peptide s1c (155ADDIVPQRESVGC167) is located in the first interruption of the Gly-X-Y domain, and s1f (52GLWKDIVVIGRSSK65) is located immediately to the amino side of homology block A (Fig. 1). These peptides were coupled to bovine serum albumin using 0.1% glutaraldehyde (18Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988Google Scholar). Polyclonal antibodies against both peptides were generated in rabbits. The antisera were affinity purified using SulfoLink Coupling Gel (Pierce) columns conjugated with the relevant peptide. Coupling and purification procedures were performed according to the manufacturer's instructions. Affinity-purified antisera were concentrated using Centriprep-10 Concentrators (Amicon). SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) was carried out on a mini-protein electrophoresis apparatus (Bio-Rad Laboratories) according to Sambrook (19Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The molecular weight standards (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) used were: α2-macroglobulin (170,000 Da), β-galactosidase (116,400), fructose-6-phosphate kinase (85,000), glutamate dehydrogenase (55,600), aldolase (39,200), and triose-phosphate isomerase (26,600). Gels were stained with 0.5% Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 (Sigma) in 40% methanol and 10% acetic acid for 30 min, and destained in 10% methanol, 10% acetic acid. Sample volumes were adjusted based on intensity of Coomassie staining to obtain approximately equal loadings of different samples for Western blotting. For Western blot analyses, proteins in SDS-polyacrylamide gels were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes after the gel had been fixed in transfer buffer (25 mm Tris, 192 mm glycine, 20% (v/v) methanol, pH 8.3) for 30 min. Proteins were transferred at 100 V for 2 h at 0 °C. After transfer, the nitrocellulose membranes were stained with Ponceau S (Sigma) to identify the positions of molecular weight markers. Membranes were blocked for 1 h in 5% dry-milk in PBST (0.05% Tween 20 in phosphate-buffered saline), then reacted with primary (numbers 483 or 1687) and secondary (goat anti-rabbit IgG horseradish peroxidase conjugate) antibodies. Enhanced Chemiluminescence (ECL, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) detection was performed as per the manufacturer's instructions. All incubations and washes were performed in PBST at room temperature. Eggs were isolated by the alkaline hypochlorite treatment (20Wood W.B. The Nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988Google Scholar) of animals grown on SNGM plates, washed in M9 buffer, and hatched in M9 buffer overnight at 20 °C. The synchronous L1 animals were placed on seeded SNGM plates and allowed to develop to various stages. Molting periods were determined by monitoring pharyngeal pumping under a dissecting microscope. Adult animals were collected 7 h after the L4 to adult molt. The temperature-sensitive dauer constitutive mutant straindaf-2(e1368) was used for generating dauer stage larvae. Animals were grown on SNGM plates at permissive temperature (20 °C) until large numbers of eggs had accumulated. Adult and larval animals were removed by gently washing the plates several times with M9 buffer. The eggs remaining on the plates were allowed to hatch and grow at the restrictive temperature (25 °C) for 2 days, until the animals had become dauer larvae. Polyclonal rabbit antisera were generated against a peptide, s1c, derived from a sequence in the first interruption of the Gly-X-Y domain of SQT-1 (Fig. 1). Affinity purified anti-s1c antisera reacted with several bands in cuticle extracts of wild-type (N2) animals, but showed no reactivity to cuticle extracts fromsqt-1(sc103) null mutant animals (Fig.2 A, lane 1; Fig. 4, lane 1). The sc103 mutation generates a nonsense codon near the beginning of the sqt-1 gene that would block production of the SQT-1 protein (10Kramer J.M. Johnson J.J. Genetics. 1993; 135: 1035-1045Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These results demonstrate that the anti-s1c antiserum is specific for SQT-1, and does not cross-react with other cuticle collagens.Figure 4Western blot analyses of rol-6and rol-6 sqt-1 mutant cuticle extracts with anti-s1c antisera.

The major antibody reactive SQT-1 products migrate as single bands at 39 and 82 kDa, and three bands between 160 and 175 kDa (seen more clearly in Fig. 5). There is also a smear of unresolved, high molecular weight material at the top of the gel. The positions of these bands relative to the size standards can change on different percentage polyacrylamide gels. For example, the 82-kDa band runs at 70 kDa on a 12% gel and at 90 kDa on a 9% gel (data not shown). This is presumably due to the abnormal electrophoretic mobility of collagens on SDS-polyacrylamide gels (21Hayashi T. Nagai Y. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1980; 87: 803-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), as was previously noted for Coomassie-stained cuticle extracts (5Cox G.N. Staprans S. Edgar R.S. Dev. Biol. 1981; 86: 456-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Despite the difficulty in determining accurate sizes for these molecules, the 39- and 82-kDa bands seen on the 10% polyacrylamide gel are likely to be monomer and dimer forms of SQT-1, based on the expected size of SQT-1 after the predicted cleavage at HBA (25 kDa) and the fact that collagens migrate approximately 40% slower in SDS-PAGE than expected by their molecular masses (22Furthmayr H. Timpl R. Anal. Biochem. 1971; 41: 510-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar, 23Freytag J.W. Noelken M.E. Hudson B.G. Biochem. 1979; 18: 4761-4768Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Also, the 39-kDa band is stronger in extracts from animals isolated during the molting period and no smaller products are detected (Fig. 5, lane 7). Whether the 82-kDa dimer band consists of two SQT-1 molecules or SQT-1 cross-linked with another molecule is unclear. The higher molecular weight materials are likely to be higher-order oligomers that contain SQT-1. Since all samples were extracted in the presence of reducing agent, these dimers and oligomers must be associated by nonreducible covalent bonds, presumably tyrosine-derived cross-links. A Coomassie-stained gel of the same wild-type cuticle extract is shown in Fig. 2 B. The two major bands run at between 100 and 110 kDa apparent molecular mass. These same bands can also be detected by Ponceau S staining of Western blots (data not shown). The SQT-1 bands do not co-migrate with these major collagen bands, indicating that the cross-linking of SQT-1 differs from that of the majority of cuticle collagens. Since all of the cuticle collagen genes predict protein products of approximately the same molecular mass, the major collagen bands of 100–110 kDa are likely to be tyrosine cross-linked trimers. The sqt-1 LRol mutants sc13and sc113 have alterations of one of the two conserved cysteine residues in the carboxyl-terminal domain of the protein (Fig.1) (10Kramer J.M. Johnson J.J. Genetics. 1993; 135: 1035-1045Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The SQT-1 Western blot patterns of cuticle extracts fromsc13 and sc113 animals are essentially identical (Fig. 2 A, lanes 5 and 6), consistent with the identical phenotypes of the two mutants (10Kramer J.M. Johnson J.J. Genetics. 1993; 135: 1035-1045Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, cross-linking of these mutant SQT-1 collagens is altered. Relative to wild-type, the mutant monomer band is much stronger, the dimer band has slightly higher mobility, and a novel band at the size expected for a SQT-1 trimer is detected. These differences were consistently seen in multiple separately prepared cuticle extracts. The total amount of SQT-1 in sc13 and sc113 cuticle extracts is approximately the same as in wild-type, indicating that the loss of one carboxyl domain cysteine does not significantly alter the efficiency of SQT-1 assembly into the cuticle. However, we noted that insc13 and sc113 mutant extracts the amounts of the dimer and the high molecular weight smear were consistently decreased (better seen in shorter exposures). This suggests that the extra monomer and trimer size molecules in these mutants represent SQT-1 that normally would be associated into dimers, tetramers, and higher oligomers. Since all samples were extracted with reducing agent, there is a difference in non-reducible, presumably tyrosine-derived, cross-linking in these mutant proteins. SQT-1 collagen, like most cuticle collagens, cannot be extracted from cuticles without the use of reducing agents because of the extensive disulfide bonding in cuticles. Although the LRol mutant SQT-1 collagens would be expected to lack a carboxyl-domain disulfide bond, their extractability from cuticles without BME is not improved (data not shown), presumably due to the presence of other disulfide bonds in the collagens. Based on site-directed mutagenesis studies, the conserved homology block A (HBA) motif of cuticle collagens has been proposed to be a protease cleavage site for collagen processing (12Yang J. Kramer J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2722-2730Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This model predicts that mutations that alter the putative cleavage site will block cleavage and leave the collagen unprocessed. Both thee1350 and sc1 alleles of sqt-1 cause dominant RRol and recessive Dpy phenotypes, and each alters one of the conserved arginine residues in HBA (Fig. 1). In multiple independent cuticle extracts made from e1350 and sc1 mutant animals much less SQT-1 was detectable on Western blots than from wild-type animals (Fig. 2 A, lanes 3 and 4), indicating that these mutant SQT-1 collagens are not efficiently assembled into the cuticle. Both mutant extracts show a strong band at 91 kDa and a weak band at 44 kDa. These bands are 9 and 5 kDa larger than the comparable wild-type dimer and monomer bands. Extracts fromsc1, but not e1350, animals also show a weak band that comigrates with the wild-type dimer at 82 kDa (Fig. 2, lane 4). Proteolytic cleavage of SQT-1 at HBA would remove 35 amino-terminal residues with a predicted mass of 4.4 kDa, very close to the observed 5-kDa difference between wild-type and thee1350 and sc1 SQT-1 monomers. These data indicate that the mutant SQT-1 molecules carrying an altered protease cleavage site are larger in size than wild-type and provide support for the HBA protease cleavage model. In sc1 cuticle extracts a weak band at 82 kDa, the same size as the wild-type dimer, was seen suggesting that some sc1mutant SQT-1 is proteolytically processed at HBA. In addition, more high molecular weight material is seen in sc1 thane1350 extracts, indicating that thesc1 mutant collagen is more efficiently assembled into cuticles. The presence of some wild-type size SQT-1 in sc1animals is consistent with the fact that sc1 animals are less dumpy and healthier than e1350 animals (10Kramer J.M. Johnson J.J. Genetics. 1993; 135: 1035-1045Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thee1350 mutation is at Arg4 of HBA (consensus Arg1-X 2-Arg3-Arg4-Gln5) while the sc1 mutation is at Arg1 (Fig. 1). The residual proteolytic processing of sc1 mutant collagen could result from utilization of the remaining Arg3-Arg4 sequence in HBA as an alternative cleavage site, since Arg-Arg is also a substrate for subtilisin-like proteinases (15Barr P.J. Cell. 1991; 66: 1-3Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (555) Google Scholar, 24Seidah N.G. Chretien M. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 244: 175-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The dimeric forms seen in both wild-type and SQT-1 mutant animals could be homodimers of two SQT-1 chains or heterodimers between SQT-1 and another molecule. The size difference between the dimer bands from wild-type and the e1350 and sc1 mutant animals is 9 kDa, about twice the difference between their monomers (5 kDa). The fact that the size of the mutant dimers is increased by twice the amount as the monomers is consistent with a homodimer of SQT-1 chains. This observation therefore suggests that the dimer band consists of two cross-linked SQT-1 collagen chains. To further confirm that proteolytic processing of SQT-1 procollagen occurs at the dibasic sequence in HBA, antisera were raised against peptide s1f, which is located immediately to the amino side of the predicted cleavage site in HBA (Fig. 1). Anti-s1f antibodies should be specific to unprocessed SQT-1 and should recognize the mutant SQT-1 in e1350 and sc1 where cleavage is blocked, but not wild-type SQT-1 or other mutant SQT-1 molecules that have intact HBA cleavage sites. After electrophoresis and transfer to nitrocellulose, lanes of wild-type and various mutant cuticle extracts were divided in half lengthwise. One set of strips was reacted with anti-s1f antisera (Fig.3, B lanes) and the other with anti-s1c antisera (Fig. 3, A lanes). The anti-s1f antisera does not react to the sqt-1(sc103) null extract, demonstrating its specificity. The anti-s1f antibodies reacted withe1350 and sc1 mutant SQT-1, but did not react to SQT-1 in either wild-type N2 or sc113, a mutant which does not alter the HBA cleavage site. The e1350 andsc1 mutant SQT-1 bands detected with anti-s1f and anti-s1c have the same mobilities. As expected, they have higher apparent molecular weights than the anti-s1c reactive bands seen in wild-type extracts. These results show that residues located on the amino side of the HBA site are not present in mature wild-type SQT-1 collagen, but are retained in mutants that affect the HBA cleavage site. Thus, cleavage of the SQT-1 procollagen normally occurs at or near HBA. Previous genetic and molecular studies suggested that the SQT-1 and ROL-6 collagens might interact with one another (10Kramer J.M. Johnson J.J. Genetics. 1993; 135: 1035-1045Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Park Y.-S. Kramer J.M. Dev. Biol. 1994; 163: 112-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 13Kusch M. Edgar R.S. Genetics. 1986; 113: 621-639Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To assess this possibility we analyzed the SQT-1 patterns in cuticle extracts from the rol-6 null mutant n1178 and the RRol mutants su1006 and e187. Bothsu1006 and e187 are alterations of one of the conserved arginines in the HBA protease cleavage site and would be expected to result in altered size of the ROL-6 collagen. No differences in the sizes of anti-s1c reactive bands were seen in any of the rol-6 mutant extracts (Fig.4). These results suggest that SQT-1 and ROL-6 chains are not cross-linked by non-reducible bonds, at least as dimer, trimer, or tetramer sized molecules. We also examined the effect of the rol-6 null background on mutant SQT-1 patterns. The SQT-1 pattern in cuticle extracts fromrol-6(n1178)sqt-1(e1350) double mutants is the same as in the e1350 single mutant, but there is significantly less SQT-1 in these cuticle extracts (Fig. 4, lanes 4 and5). This result may explain why the e1350 Dpy phenotype is suppressed in the rol-6 null background, such that the double mutant phenotype is similar to the sqt-1null. The pattern of SQT-1 in rol-6(n1178)sqt-1(sc13) andsqt-1(sc13) are similar (Fig. 4, lanes 6 and7), consistent with the fact that these animals have very similar LRol phenotypes. SQT-1 collagen could have different cross-linking or processing properties at different developmental stages. To assess this possibility cuticle extracts were prepared from synchronized populations of animals at different developmental stages and analyzed on Western blots (Fig.5). SQT-1 was detected in L2, L3, and L4 larvae, and adult extracts (lanes 2–5), but not in L1 or dauer larvae extracts (lanes 1 and 6). The Western blot patterns of SQT-1 in L2, L3, and L4 larval stages are very similar to each other, all having the 82-kDa dimer band and three bands between 160 and 175 kDa. The L4 extract also shows the 39-kDa monomer band, which is only variably detected in extracts from non-molting animals. The adult extract shows only the three 160–175-kDa bands and a smear of higher molecular mass material. The absence of smaller SQT-1 forms likely results from a higher degree of cross-linking in the adult cuticle extract. To better assess the nature of SQT-1 cross-linking in the adult stage cuticle, extracts from animals at the L4 to adult molt, when the adult cuticle is being assembled, were analyzed (Fig. 5, lane 7). This extract shows the same monomer, dimer, and three 160–175-kDa bands seen in the L2-L4 extracts. Thus, there are no detectable qualitative differences in the SQT-1 Western blot patterns at different developmental stages. The development of antisera specific for the SQT-1 cuticle collagen has allowed the first analyses of the assembly of one representative of the approximately 150 member cuticle collagen family of C. elegans. Our results show that SQT-1 chains are rapidly cross-linked by both reducible and non-reducible bonds. The non-reducible bonds are most certainly di-, tri-, and/or isotri-tyrosine residues as have been detected in other nematodes (6Fujimoto D. Horiuchi K. Hirama M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1981; 99: 637-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar,7Fetterer R.H. Rhoads M.L. Urban J.F. J. Parasitol. 1993; 79: 160-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) and in C. elegans cuticle extracts. 2D. Eyre and J. Kramer, unpublished results. The tyrosine cross-linking of SQT-1 is orderly, with the same dimer (82 kDa) and three tetramer (160–175 kDa) sized products being detected in cuticles from different developmental stages. Analysis of sqt-1mutant proteins indicate that the dimer sized product contains two SQT-1 chains. It is not clear whether dimers form between two SQT-1 chains within a single collagen molecule or between two separate molecules. It is notable that the bulk of cuticle collagens, as detected by Coomassie staining, are primarily trimer and larger sizes. Thus, different cuticle collagens can have distinct patterns of tyrosine-derived cross-linking. Mutants of sqt-1 that alter a conserved cysteine in the carboxyl-terminal domain of the protein cause inhibition of tyrosine-derived cross-linking. The altered cysteine is immediately adjacent to a tyrosine residue that is conserved in all members of thesqt-1 cuticle collagen subfamily (Fig. 1) and there are similarly located tyrosines in the carboxyl domains of other subfamilies. The ability of this tyrosine to efficiently participate in cross-linking is apparently dependent on formation of an adjacent disulfide bond. The sqt-1 LRol mutants remove this disulfide bond and therefore SQT-1 monomers accumulate. The higher mobility of the LRol mutant dimer-sized product may result from a change in the position of the cross-link connecting monomers and/or a change in which collagen chains are cross-linked together. The appearance of trimer-sized bands in the LRol mutants suggests that normally monomers efficiently form dimers which then associate into tetramers. The high concentration of monomers in the mutants may allow for aberrant trimer formation. The LRol phenotype displayed by these mutants may be a result of the loss of disulfide bonds, loss of non-reducible bonds, and/or the formation of abnormal dimeric, trimeric, or higher oligomeric products. Previous studies of genetic and in vitro generated mutations showed that RRol mutants of sqt-1 and rol-6 are alterations in homology block A (Fig. 1) and suggested that it is a site for processing by a subtilisin-like protease (10Kramer J.M. Johnson J.J. Genetics. 1993; 135: 1035-1045Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12Yang J. Kramer J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2722-2730Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The results presented here strongly support that suggestion. The portion of the polypeptide on the amino side of HBA is only retained in RRol mutant SQT-1 molecules and the mutant protein is larger by the amount predicted. Thus, SQT-1 is synthesized as a procollagen that is normally cleaved at HBA before incorporation into the cuticle. A reduced amount of the uncleaved pN-SQT-1 assembles into the cuticle, suggesting that this processing is important for the collagen to be efficiently secreted into the cuticle. Nearly all C. elegans cuticle collagens, as well as those of other nematode species (25Cox G.N. J. Parasitol. 1992; 78: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), have a well conserved HBA and are therefore likely to be proteolytically processed at this site. The presence of pN-SQT-1 in the cuticle can cause severe morphological abnormalities. Mutant homozygotes are slow growing and have a Dpy phenotype, while heterozygotes display a strong RRol phenotype. The pN-SQT-1 molecules dominantly disrupt the normal cuticle structure. Mutations that alter the procollagen N-proteinase processing site of human type I collagen cause autosomal dominant Ehlers-Danlos syndromes type VIIA and VIIB (26Byers P.H. Duvic M. Atkinson M. Robinow M. Smith L.T. Krane S.M. Greally M.T. Ludman M. Matalon R. Pauker S. Quanbeck D. Schwarze U. Am. J. Med. Genet. 1997; 72: 94-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). These patients have joint hypermobility and subluxations, hip dislocations, scoliosis, and increased bone fractures. The unprocessed type I collagen affects fibrillogenesis, as collagen fibrils in patient's skin show irregular cross-sections and spacing. The C. elegans sqt-1 HBA mutations represent the cuticle collagen equivalent of human EDS types VIIA and VIIB. The spacing of conserved basic residues in HBA, Arg-X-X-Arg, suggested that it could be cleaved by a subtilisin-like protease, based on their known substrate specificity (15Barr P.J. Cell. 1991; 66: 1-3Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (555) Google Scholar, 27Seidah N.G. Day R. Chretien M. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1993; 21: 685-691Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The utilization of subtilisin-like enzymes for collagen processing appears to be unusual. Proteolytic processing of procollagen occurs with many vertebrate collagen types, however, the identified N- and C-propeptidases are not subtilisin-related enzymes (28Colige A. Li S.W. Sieron A.L. Nusgens B.V. Prockop D.J. Lapiere C.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2374-2379Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 29Kessler E. Takahara K. Biniaminov L. Brusel M. Greenspan D.S.

A. 1996; 93: 5127-5130Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Processing of type XVI collagen, at least when expressed as a recombinant molecule in cultured kidney cells, may occur via a subtilisin-like protease (31Tillet E. Mann K. Nischt R. Pan T.C. Chu M.L. Timpl R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 228: 160-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), but it is not clear that this represents its normal processing. The bli-4 gene of C. elegans encodes a family of subtilisin-like protease isoforms (32Peters K. McDowall J. Rose A.M. Genetics. 1991; 129: 95-102Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,33Thacker C. Peters K. Srayko M. Rose A.M. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 956-971Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Most mutations in bli-4 cause early larval lethality, however, one isoform-specific mutation causes blistering of the cuticle suggesting that BLI-4 could process cuticle collagens. Additional genes encoding subtilisin-like proteases are present in the C. elegans genome and they could also be involved processing cuticle collagens. Genetic interactions between sqt-1 and rol-6 (10Kramer J.M. Johnson J.J. Genetics. 1993; 135: 1035-1045Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,13Kusch M. Edgar R.S. Genetics. 1986; 113: 621-639Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and their equivalent temporal expression patterns (11Park Y.-S. Kramer J.M. Dev. Biol. 1994; 163: 112-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) led to the suggestion that these collagen chains may physically interact. In these studies we found no evidence for formation of non-reducible cross-links between SQT-1 and ROL-6. However, it is still possible that these two collagen chains could be part of a single heterotrimeric collagen molecule. Because of the conditions necessary to extract collagens from the cuticle, noncovalent or reducible covalent bonds between the chains would have been disrupted. One genetic interaction, suppression of sqt-1 HBA mutant Dpy phenotypes in the rol-6 null background (10Kramer J.M. Johnson J.J. Genetics. 1993; 135: 1035-1045Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), can be explained from our results. In the rol-6 null background much less of the sqt-1(e1350) mutant protein is present in the cuticle. In some manner, the absence of ROL-6 inhibits the assembly and/or secretion of this class of SQT-1 mutant protein. Since it is the presence of abnormal SQT-1 in the cuticle that causes the Dpy phenotype, the rol-6 null suppresses by removing the abnormal protein. This mechanism does not affect the LRol class ofsqt-1 mutants since normal amounts of the LRol SQT-1 are found in rol-6 null background cuticles. Analyses of sqt-1 and rol-6 mRNA detected expression of both genes at all stages that exhibit mutant phenotypes, except the dauer larva stage (11Park Y.-S. Kramer J.M. Dev. Biol. 1994; 163: 112-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Dauer larvae displaysqt-1 and rol-6 mutant phenotypes, but no expression of either gene was detected during formation of the dauer cuticle. The Western blot analyses of SQT-1 protein expression reported here are consistent with the mRNA expression data. SQT-1 is detected in cuticles from L2, L3, and L4 larvae, and adults, but not in cuticles from dauer larvae. In sqt-1 mutant animals, the dauer cuticle can be helically twisted even though no SQT-1 protein is detectable in the cuticle. We have proposed that expression of the Rol phenotype at the dauer stage occurs in the absence of mutant SQT-1 or ROL-6 collagen and results from maintenance of the helical twist generated in the preceding L2 stage animal (11Park Y.-S. Kramer J.M. Dev. Biol. 1994; 163: 112-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The hypodermis is attached to the cuticle and becomes helically twisted when the L2 cuticle, which does contain SQT-1, twists. When the dauer cuticle is synthesized no mutant collagen is made, but the new cuticle is assembled by a hypodermis that is already helically twisted. The resulting dauer cuticle is constructed of normal collagen and maintains the twist that was built into it by the twisted hypodermis. The results showing that SQT-1 protein is not detected in the dauer cuticle provide further support for this model."

Calmettes P. von Hippel P.H. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 111-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) and shows structural and mechanistic similarities to hexameric DNA helicases such as E. coli DnaB and the T7 gene 4 helicase (8Bujalowski W.

The tertiary structure of the RNA-binding domain residing at the N terminus of rho is homologous to the structure of the N-terminal domain of the F1-ATPase, despite there being no amino acid sequence homology between them (10Allison T.J.

The C-terminal domain of rho shows significant amino acid homology to the β-subunit of F1-ATPase. The amino acid sequence homology between rho and the β subunit is more striking than the amino acid sequence homology between the α and β subunits of the F1-ATPase protein (11Miwa Y. Horiguchi T.

In addition to the structural similarity, the ATPase mechanisms of both rho and the T7 gene 4 helicase show striking similarity to the binding change mechanism of the F1-ATPase protein (9Hingorani M.M.

Our previous studies showed that the ATPase turnover rate was different at the two classes of nucleotide binding sites on the rho hexamer (18Kim D.E. Shigesada K. Patel S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11623-11628Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). In the presence of poly(C) RNA, the ATPase turnover at the high affinity noncatalytic sites was 1500 times slower than at the low affinity catalytic sites. In this paper, the mechanism of the ATPase reaction at the noncatalytic sites was determined using pre-steady-state kinetic approaches. This study allowed us to make a comparison between the mechanisms of ATP hydrolysis at the noncatalytic and the catalytic sites of the rho hexamer. Purified rho protein was provided by Dr. Katsuya Shigasada (Department of Genetics and Molecular Biology, Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan). The rho protein was overexpressed inE. coli strain HB101 carrying the rho overexpression plasmid pKS26 (19Mori H. Imai M. Shigesada K. J. Mol. Biol. 1989; 210: 39-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) and purified according to Finger and Richardson (20Finger L.R. Richardson J.P. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 1640-1645Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) with slight modifications. The rho protein concentration was determined by UV absorption at 280 nm using an extinction coefficient of 0.325 (mg/ml)−1 cm−1 (7Geiselmann J. Yager T.D. Gill S.C. Calmettes P. von Hippel P.H. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 111-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The ATP and RNA homopolymer, poly(C), was purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Poly(C) RNA had a reported s 20,w value of 7.1 in 0.015 m NaCl, 0.0015 m sodium citrate buffer, pH 7.0, with an average length of 420 bases. Poly(C) RNA concentration was determined by UV absorption at 269 nm using an extinction coefficient of 6200 m−1cm−1 for the cytosine base. These RNAs were dissolved in TE buffer (40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, 0.5 mm EDTA) and used without further purification. [α-32P]ATP was purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, and its purity was assessed by polyethyleneimine-cellulose TLC and corrected for in all experiments. The kinetic experiments were conducted using a rapid chemical quench-flow instrument (21Johnson K.A. Sigman D.S. The Enzymes. Academic Press, Orlando, FL1992: 1-61Google Scholar) built by KinTek Corp. (State College, PA) at a constant temperature of 18 or 10 °C. In the three syringe experimental set-up, two delay times were used (KinTek RQF-3 software) as shown in Scheme I. The pulse-chase kinetics were measured at fixed t 1and varying t 2 (0.015–7 s). A 14-μl mixture of rho protein (2.0 μm hexamer) and poly(C) RNA (2.68 μm) in 40 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.8), 100 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm dithiothreitol, and 10% (v/v) glycerol was rapidly mixed with a 14-μl mixture of ATP (100 μm) and [α-32P]ATP (0.03 μCi/μl) fort 1. After reacting the above fort 1, 31 μl of nonradioactive ATP (5 mm, final concentration after mixing and 10 mmfree MgCl2) was added from a third syringe in the quench-flow instrument. The final unlabeled ATP concentration exceeded the labeled ATP concentration by at least 200-fold. A total of 59-μl reactions were chased for varying times (t 2) and quenched with 120 μl of 0.5 m formic acid to stop the reaction. Aliquots (1.0 μl) from each acid-quenched reaction at varying time points were spotted on polyethyleneimine-cellulose TLC, which was developed in 0.3 m potassium phosphate, pH 3.4. The resolved radioactive ATP and ADP were quantitated on a PhosphorImager instrument (Molecular Dynamics). Product formation was equal to the radioactivity corresponding to ADP divided by the total radioactivity. To estimate ATP hydrolyzed in the reaction time (t 1) prior to the ATP chase, 0.5 mformic acid was added from the third syringe instead of the ATP chase. This control experiment was repeated three times, and the values were averaged and taken as a zero time point in the chase-time period (Δt 2). The efficiency of 0.5 m formic acid as a quench was determined by loading the rho protein/RNA solution into one sample loop, the reaction buffer into the other sample loop, the quench solution into the third syringe line, and the [α-32P]ATP solution including the nonradioactive ATP chase into the collecting microcentrifuge tube (21Johnson K.A. Sigman D.S. The Enzymes. Academic Press, Orlando, FL1992: 1-61Google Scholar). In this configuration, the enzyme solution was then rapidly mixed with the quench solution for 5 ms prior to mixing with the ATP solution. Only 0.03% of ATP was hydrolyzed to ADP, which was the same as the level observed in the absence of enzyme. This indicates that the quench solution inactivated the enzyme within 5 ms. The hydrolysis of radioactive ATP during the chase-time, t 2, was corrected as follows. A correction factor, B, was calculated, B=[E]p×D×kcat×[ATP]p×D/[ATP]cEquation 1 where [E]p (1.0 μm) is the concentration of rho hexamer before chase, D (28 μl/59 μl) is the dilution factor because of the addition of chase, [ATP]p (50 μm) is the concentration of radioactive ATP before chase, k cat is the ATPase turnover number (30 and 8.8 s−1 at 18 and 10 °C, respectively), and [ATP]c (5.0 mm) is the concentration of chase ATP. The value of B ×t 2 was subtracted from each data point in the pulse-chase experiments. The corrected amounts of ADP formed during the chase-time t 2 were plotted and were fit to the following single exponential equation with a y intercept using the Sigma Plot software version 5.0 (SPSS). [ADP]t2=[ADP]t1+A(1-e-k×t2)Equation 2 Where t 1 and t 2are the two delay times (see Scheme I), [ADP] t1 is the amount of ADP formed during the reaction time (t 1), [ADP] t2 is the total amount of ADP formed,k is the rate of ATP hydrolysis during chase-timet 2, and A represents the amount of ADP formed during chase-time t 2. The two classes of ATP binding sites on the rho hexamer termed catalytic and noncatalytic sites hydrolyze ATP at different rates. At the catalytic sites, close to 30 ATPs are hydrolyzed/mole of rho hexamer/second, and our previous studies have shown that the ATPase turnover at the noncatalytic sites is about 1500 times slower (18Kim D.E. Shigesada K. Patel S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11623-11628Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The fast ATPase turnover at the catalytic sites precludes measurement of the slow ATPase reaction at the noncatalytic sites. To dissect the ATPase kinetics at the noncatalytic sites, we took advantage of the tight binding of ATP at the noncatalytic sites and used pulse-chase experiments to determine the kinetics of ATP binding and hydrolysis at those sites. Scheme I shows the design of the pulse-chase experiments. A complex of rho protein and poly(C) RNA was mixed with [α-32P]ATP for a fixed pulse-timet 1. During t 1, the radioactive ATP is presumed to bind both to the catalytic and the noncatalytic sites and to undergo a few cycles of ATP hydrolysis at the catalytic sites. To avoid extensive ATP hydrolysis at the catalytic site, the pulse-time t 1 was kept in the millisecond range. After t 1, the reaction was chased with excess nonradioactive ATP. The chase-timet 2 was varied from 15 ms to several seconds before acid was added to stop the reaction. The free MgCl2in the above reactions was always kept at 10 mmconcentration. During the chase-time t 2, a percentage of rho-bound radioactive ATP would dissociate, and a percentage would hydrolyze to ADP and Pi dictated by the respective rates of ATP dissociation and ATP hydrolysis on the protein. The radioactive ATP that dissociates from rho can not rebind because it will be diluted in the pool of excess nonradioactive ATP. From the kinetics of radioactive ADP formation in the chase-timet 2, one can estimate both the number of ATP molecules that remain bound and chased to product as well as their rate of hydrolysis. Fig. 1 A shows the results of such an experiment where pulse-time t 1 was fixed to 0.1 s, and the chase-time t 2 was varied from 0.015–7.0 s. There are two exponential phases in the pulse-chase time course. Because of the lack of time points shorter than 15 ms, the fast exponential phase could not be defined. Hence, the data were fit to a single exponential with a y intercept (Equation 2) instead of the sum of two exponentials. This fit provided the rate constant of the slow phase and the amplitudes of both the slow and the fast phase. A total of four ATPs were chased to ADP during the chase-period, indicating that at least four ATPs were bound in the pulse-time of 0.1 s. Of the four ATPs, one was hydrolyzed at a very fast rate estimated to be >150 s−1 in the chase-timet 2 (assuming that the first time point of 15 ms represented 3–4 half-lives), and the rest were hydrolyzed at a slow rate equal to 1.9 s−1. The ATP that was hydrolyzed at a rate greater than the steady-state ATPase turnover was most likely bound to one of the catalytic sites. The remaining three ATPs must be bound to the noncatalytic sites, because these were hydrolyzed at a rate 15 times slower than the steady-state ATPase rate of 30 s−1. Similar kinetics were observed when the pulse-time t 1 was changed to 30 ms (Fig. 1 B). Only the total number of ATPs chased to product was different. After a 30-ms pulse, a total of 1.8 radioactive ATPs/rho hexamer were chased to products. Of the 1.8 ATPs, less than 1 ATP (0.51 ATP) was hydrolyzed to ADP at a fast rate and about 1.3 ATPs were hydrolyzed at a slow rate. These results indicate that only a limited number of ATPs were bound to the noncatalytic sites during the pulse-time of 30 ms. This result prompted us to carry out a systematic study in which the pulse-chase kinetics were measured at various fixed pulse-times to measure the apparent rate of ATP binding to the noncatalytic sites. Examination of the pulse-chase kinetics at varying pulse-times provided an estimate of the apparent bimolecular rate of ATP binding to the noncatalytic sites. The chase kinetics were measured at various pulse-times t 1 that ranged from 10 to 150 ms. Each chase-time course was analyzed to obtain the number of ATPs bound to the noncatalytic and the catalytic sites and the rate of ATP hydrolysis at the noncatalytic sites. These parameters were obtained from computer fit of the data to a single exponential with ay intercept (Equation 2 under “Materials and Methods”). As the pulse-time t 1 was increased from 10 to 150 ms, the total number of ATPs chased to product increased to a maximum of three to four. As shown in Fig.2 A, during a 10–150-ms pulse-time, less than one ATP (0.60 ± 0.08) was hydrolyzed at a very fast rate (within the fastest time point of 15 ms). The number of ATPs that were more slowly hydrolyzed to product increased from one to a maximum of three ATPs (2.8 ± 0.2) as the pulse-timet 1 was increased (Fig. 2 B). This increase in ATP site occupation at the noncatalytic sites was exponential and fit to a rate constant of 27 s−1. The rate of slow ATP hydrolysis remained constant around an average value of 1.8 s−1 (Fig. 2 C). We assume that the fast hydrolysis of ATP at one site occurs at the catalytic site, and the slow hydrolysis of close to three ATPs occurs at the noncatalytic sites. Assuming that ATP binding is the rate-limiting step at the noncatalytic sites, an apparent bimolecular rate constant for ATP binding to the noncatalytic site, k on, of 5.4 × 105m−1s−1 was calculated by dividing the observed exponential rate by the concentration of ATP in the reaction (27 s−1/50 μm). In the pulse-chase experiments described above, we found that the ATP bound at the catalytic site was completely hydrolyzed to ADP in the shortest chase-time of 15 ms. Thus, we could only estimate its rate of hydrolysis at >150 s−1. To obtain a more accurate value for the rate of ATP hydrolysis at the catalytic site, we performed the pulse-chase experiment both at a lower temperature of 10 °C and at a higher concentration of rho. Fig. 3 shows the results of the pulse-chase experiment in which the pulse-time was fixed at 0.3 s and the chase-time was varied. The same kinetic pattern for hydrolysis of ATP was observed at the lower temperature. One ATP was hydrolyzed at a fast rate and two to three (2.2 ± 0.3 ATPs) were hydrolyzed at a slow rate. The ATP hydrolysis at the catalytic site was still too fast to measure. Most of the ATP at the catalytic site was hydrolyzed in the fastest time of 15 ms providing an estimate of >150 s−1 for the hydrolysis rate at 10 °C. The ATP hydrolysis rate at the noncatalytic sites decreased to a value of 1.12 s−1, about 1.6 times slower than the rate of hydrolysis at 18 °C. Assuming the same temperature dependence for the catalytic site, we estimate that ATP hydrolysis at the catalytic sites occurs at a rate >240 s−1 at 18 °C. The results presented in this paper provide a kinetic pathway for the ATPase reaction at the noncatalytic sites of the rho hexamer. Combined with the recently published model of ATPase reaction at the catalytic site (12Stitt B.L. Xu Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26477-26486Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), it allows us to make a comparison between the ATPase reaction pathway at the catalyticversus the noncatalytic sites (Fig.4). Although the two pathways are shown as independent ones, note that they occur simultaneously at the two types of sites on the rho hexamer. Fig. 4 A summarizes the ATPase reaction at the noncatalytic sites. Three ATPs bind to the noncatalytic sites of rho with an apparent bimolecular rate constant of 5.4 × 105m−1s−1. These ATPs are hydrolyzed at a rate of about 1.8 s−1, and the products, ADP and/or Pi, dissociate from the active site at a rate of 0.02 s−1. The dissociation rate was obtained from previous studies (18Kim D.E. Shigesada K. Patel S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11623-11628Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). In contrast, hydrolysis of ATP has been proposed to be sequential at the catalytic sites as shown in Fig. 4 B (12Stitt B.L. Xu Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26477-26486Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The rho-ATP complex at the catalytic site is formed with an apparent bimolecular rate of 3 × 106m−1 s−1, estimated from the ratiok cat/K m. Only one ATP is hydrolyzed at a time at the catalytic site. This rate is estimated at >240 s−1 from this study as well as a published study on the ATPase kinetics (12Stitt B.L. Xu Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26477-26486Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). In that report (12Stitt B.L. Xu Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26477-26486Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), a pre-steady-state burst of ATP hydrolysis was observed, implying that a step following ATP hydrolysis is a rate-limiting step. After the rate-limiting step, the next catalytic subunit presumably goes through the same cycle of ATP binding and hydrolysis. When we compare the ATPase kinetics at the two types of sites, it is clear that sequential hydrolysis of ATP does not occur at the noncatalytic sites. The results in this paper show that all three ATPs are hydrolyzed simultaneously at the noncatalytic sites at a slow rate relative to the catalytic site (Fig. 2, B andC). Hence, there does not appear to be any cooperativity in ATP binding and hydrolysis at the noncatalytic sites. The rate of ATP hydrolysis is at least 130 times slower (>240 s−1/1.8 s−1), and product release is 1500 times slower at the noncatalytic sites compared with the corresponding steps at the catalytic site, assuming that k cat is largely determined by the product release step at the catalytic sites. This indicates that the ATP and/or the ADP and Pi species are bound to the noncatalytic sites, whereas multiple ATPase turnovers occur at the catalytic sites. Noncatalytic sites have been identified thus far in three hexameric proteins including rho protein, the T7 gene 4 helicase (8Bujalowski W. Klonowska M.M. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 5888-5900Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), and the F1-ATPase (22Cross R.L. Nalin C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 2874-2881Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23Abrahams J.P. Leslie A.G. Lutter R. Walker J.E. Nature. 1994; 370: 621-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (2763) Google Scholar). In the α3β3 structure of F1-ATPase, the noncatalytic sites reside primarily on the α subunits. The ATP binding site of the α subunits lacks critical amino acids that are necessary for catalysis of ATP hydrolysis. Thus, hydrolysis of ATP at the noncatalytic sites of F1-ATPase is not easily detectable. Because rho is a homohexamer, the catalytic and noncatalytic active sites must be induced either during hexamer formation or upon ATP and/or RNA binding. If the catalytic and noncatalytic active sites of rho contain the same amino acids, then the observed difference in the ATPase rates at the two sites suggests that the conformation of some of the critical amino acid residues that are involved in ATP hydrolysis are different. This hypothesis will be tested when the high resolution structure of rho hexamer in the presence of ATP is available. The noncatalytic sites were first identified in the F1-ATPase protein. However, the exact role of the noncatalytic sites in F1-ATPase is still unclear. Nevertheless several studies indicate that the noncatalytic sites are essential for optimal ATPase activity. It has been suggested that the fully functional noncatalytic sites in F1-ATPase are necessary for maintaining cooperative catalysis at the catalytic sites. When wild-type α subunits in F1-ATPase hexamer were replaced with mutant α subunits defective in ATP binding, the ATP hydrolysis at the catalytic sites was inhibited in a time-dependent manner (24Matsui T. Muneyuki E. Honda M. Allison W.S. Dou C. Yoshida M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8215-8221Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). This time-dependent inhibition was shown to be because of tight binding of inhibitory Mg-ADP at the catalytic sites. These results suggest that the fully functional noncatalytic sites in F1-ATPase are required for continuous ATPase turnover at the catalytic sites. Two experiments with rho suggest that the noncatalytic sites in rho are essential. When two to three subunits of the wild-type rho hexamer were exchanged for an inactive mutant protein, a loss in the ATPase activity of rho was observed (25Richardson J.P. Ruteshouser E.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1986; 189: 413-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Some of these substituted subunits could be the noncatalytic subunits, but it can be argued also that this inhibition was because of the loss in the function of the catalytic sites. Inactivation of the rho ATPase was also observed when one rho subunit was covalently modified with 8-azido-ATP (26O I. Stitt B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5009-5015Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Assuming that the catalytic and noncatalytic sites have an equal chance of being covalently modified, the results argue that modification of the noncatalytic sites inhibits ATP hydrolysis at the catalytic sites. Is the hydrolysis of ATP at the noncatalytic sites coupled to movement on the RNA? To address this question, we have calculated the coupling constants (nt1 moved/ATP hydrolyzed) for the catalytic and noncatalytic sites. Based on these numbers, we conclude that the conformational changes resulting from the hydrolysis of ATP at the noncatalytic sites cannot be directly coupled to movement. Walstrom et al. (27Walstrom K.M. Dozono J.M. Robic S. von Hippel P.H. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 7980-7992Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 28Walstrom K.M. Dozono J.M. von Hippel P.H. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 7993-8004Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) have reported that rho translocates along the RNA at a rate of ∼20 nt/s and consumes about 1–2 ATP when translocating about 1 nucleotide of RNA. This provides a coupling constant of about 0.5–1 nt/ATP hydrolyzed for the catalytic sites. Similarly, Brennan et al. (29Brennan C.A. Steinmetz E.J. Spear P. Platt T. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 5440-5447Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) have reported a coupling constant close to 0.06 nt/ATP hydrolyzed. The ATP turnover at the noncatalytic sites of rho occurs at 0.02 s−1 (18Kim D.E. Shigesada K. Patel S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11623-11628Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). To calculate the coupling constant for the noncatalytic sites, we have corrected the above translocation rate (decreased 4-fold) because that number was measured at 37 °C and the turnover number of 0.02 s−1 at the noncatalytic sites was measured at 18 °C. According to this rough calculation, if the hydrolysis at the noncatalytic sites were directly coupled to movement of rho along the RNA, then the rho protein will move close to 250 nt/ATP hydrolyzed. We believe that this is unlikely because rho binds only about 60–70 nt of RNA (30Bear D.G. Hicks P.S. Escudero K.W. Andrews C.L. McSwiggen J.A. von Hippel P.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1988; 199: 623-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). We therefore propose that the energy from ATP hydrolysis at the noncatalytic sites alone is not utilized directly for translocation or for nucleic acid unwinding. At this time, the role of ATP binding or its hydrolysis at the noncatalytic sites is unclear. The ATP at the noncatalytic sites may play a regulatory role analogous to that proposed for the noncatalytic sites of F1-ATPase; that is, these sites mediate cooperative catalysis of ATP at the catalytic sites and/or ensure continuous ATP hydrolysis at the catalytic sites. Alternatively, the noncatalytic subunits may participate in interactions with the nucleic acid during active ATP hydrolysis at the catalytic site and thus facilitate processive translocation of the protein on the nucleic acid. We thank Dr. Katsuya Shigesada (Kyoto University, Japan) for the gift of purified rho protein and for critical discussion of some of these studies."

EMBO J. 1983; 12: 1587-1595Crossref Scopus (95) Google Scholar). PDI has been proposed to function as a molecular chaperone by binding to unfolded protein species, thereby preventing aggregation and misfolding (4Song J.L. Wang C.C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 231: 312-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 5Song J.L. Ouan H. Wang C.C. Biochem. J. 1997; 273: 9637-9643Google Scholar). Despite these interesting studies, the situation is complicated because PDI, unlike other chaperones, catalyzes disulfide bond formation and reduction. Several laboratories have attempted to show the site of binding of small molecular weight polypeptides that compete with misfolded protein substrates. Mutated PDI with the carboxyl terminus deleted shows neither peptide binding nor chaperone activity in assisting the refolding of denatured d-glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (6Dai Y. Wang C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272 (27576): 27572Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). On the other hand, it has been reported that deletion of the carboxyl-terminal domain (C domain) has no inhibitory effect on the assembly of recombinant prolyl-4-hydroxylase (7Koivunen P. Pirneskoski A. Karvonen P. Ljung J. Helakoski T. Trontbohm H. Kivirikko K.J. EMBO, J. 1999; 18: 65-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Other investigators have reported that small molecular weight peptides bind to the b′ domain of PDI (8Klappa P. Ruddeck L.W. Darby N.J. Freedman R.B. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 927-935Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). The possibility exists that more than one site in the structure of PDI is involved in recognition and refolding of protein substrates. The binding and hydrolysis of ATP by PDI has been reported by Guthapfelet al. (9Guthapfel R. Gueguen P. Quemeneur E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2663-2666Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar); strikingly, the ATPase reaction is stimulated in the presence of denatured polypeptides, whereas the disulfide oxidation of PDI is not influenced by ATP. However, the functional role played by ATP hydrolysis during the refolding of denatured proteins has not been investigated in detail. The aim of the present work is 2-fold: first, to study regions of the primary structure of PDI involved in recognition of unfolded protein substrates and, second, to investigate whether the free energy of hydrolysis of ATP is required for unfolding of misfolded protein substrates. PDI was purified by the method described in Ref. 10Hillson D.A. Lambert N. Freedman R.B. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 107: 281-294Crossref Scopus (188) Google Scholar with small modifications. Fresh porcine livers (600 g) were homogenized in 0.1 m phosphate (pH 7.5) containing 1% Triton X-100 and 5 mm EDTA. After centrifugation, the supernatant was treated with ammonium sulfate, and the fractions obtained between 55–85% saturation were suspended in 25 mm citrate buffer (pH 5.3), dialyzed against the same buffer (buffer A), applied to CM-Sephadex C-50 column and eluted with the same buffer. Fractions displaying PDI activity were pooled, dialyzed against 20 mm sodium phosphate (pH 6.3) (buffer B), and applied to a DEAE-Sepharose fast flow column, which was eluted using a linear gradient of 0–0.7 m NaCl in buffer B. Purified PDI was kept at 4 °C and used in subsequent studies. The concentration of PDI was determined using absorbance at 280 nm = 1 for 1 mg of protein/ml (11Gilbert H.F.

The protein GroEL was purified by modifications of the procedure included in Ref.13Makino Y. Taguchi H. Yoshida M. FEBS Lett. 1993; 336: 363-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar. After ammonium sulfate fractionation, the protein was purified by means of three chromatographic steps: DEAE-Sephacel, gel filtration through Sepharose CL-4B, and affinity chromatography through red agarose (14Todd M.J. Lorimer G.H. Methods Enzymol. 1998; 290: 135-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The last step removes contaminating proteins trapped by GroEL. The protein concentration was calculated using absorbance at 280 nm = 0.15 for 2.5 mg of protein/ml. Porcine heart mMDH was purchased from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. The enzyme was dialyzed against 20 mm Tris/HCl buffer, pH 7.5, at 4 °C, applied to a DEAE-cellulose column, and eluted by means of a linear gradient made with the equilibrium buffer (20 mm) and the same volume of 100 mm Tris/HCl (pH 7.5). The active fractions were concentrated by ultrafiltration. The enzyme concentration was calculated using A 280 = 2.5 for a 1% solution. (15Li W. Churchich J.E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 246: 127-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). A solution of MDH (5 mg/ml) was prepared in 100 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, containing 3m GdnHCl and allowed to denature at 25 °C for 1 h. The protein solution was 5-fold diluted with 100 mmTris/HCl, pH 7.5, and then passed through a Sephadex G-25 column to remove GdnHCl. Renaturation of MDH was initiated by diluting denatured protein (0.1 μm) in renaturation buffer and incubated for 3 h at 25 °C. The renaturation buffer consisted of 100 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, dithiothreitol (1 mm), and KCl (0.1 m) with and without chaperone proteins. Aliquots of this renaturing reaction were withdrawn at specific times and assayed for MDH activity. The assay buffer consisted of 100 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 0.5 mm oxaloacetate, and 0.2 mm NADH. The initial rate of conversion of NADH to NAD was determined by measuring changes in absorbance for 1 min at 25 °C. Porcine livers were obtained from a local slaughter house. DEAE-Sephacel, DEAE-Sepharose, CM-cellulose, DEAE-cellulose, and Sephadex-G-25 were purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Insulin, GSH, NADPH, DTT, gluthione reductase, and scrambled RNase A were purchased from Sigma. The polypeptide mastoparan was obtained from Sigma. The reagent iodoacetamide fluorescein was purchased from Molecular Probes, Inc. (Eugene, OR). PDI (1 mg/ml) was reacted with iodoacetamide fluorescein (IAF) at a final concentration of 0.1 mm in 0.1 m potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) containing 0.5 m GdnHCl at 4 °C for 12 h. Under this set of experimental conditions, SH groups located in the central domain of the protein are exposed to the alkylating reagent. The labeled protein was dialyzed against 0.1 m potassium phosphate (pH 7.4) to remove unreacted dye, followed by gel filtration chromatography on Sephadex-G-25. The labeled protein displayed catalytic activity when assayed using insulin as a substrate, suggesting that alkylation on the thioredoxin domain has not taken place. The degree of labeling (1.3 mol of IAF/mol of monomer) was determined by using an extinction coefficient of 4.9 × 104m−1 cm−1 at 490 nm. The modified protein was denatured in 0.8 ml of 6m guanidinium chloride containing dithiothreitol (1 mm) for 1 h at 37 °C. A freshly prepared solution of 20 mm iodoacetic acid was then added, and the mixture was incubated in the dark at room temperature for 30 min. The mixture was then dialyzed against 2 liters of 0.1 m ammonium bicarbonate. The labeled protein (100 nmol) was suspended in 0.8 ml of 0.1m ammonium bicarbonate, pH 8, and digested with trypsin for 24 h at 37 °C at a substrate/trypsin ratio of 40:1 (by mass). To 0.8 ml of tryptic digest, 50 μl of acetic acid was added, and the precipitate was removed by centrifugation. The solution was then lyophilized, and the peptides were separated by reverse-phase HPLC (Vydac C18 column). The separation was performed with a linear gradient of 10–80% B over 70 min at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. Eluant A was 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, and eluant B was 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in 80:20 acetonitrile/H2O. Absorbance was monitored at 220 nm, and fluorescence was monitored at 535 nm for the detection of labeled peptides. The fluorescent peptides were further purified with a linear gradient of 5–60% B over 30 min at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. The sequence of the isolated peptide, labeled with fluorescein, was determined by Edman degradation using an Applied Biosystems model sequencer (model 492 cLC). Emission spectra were recorded in a Perkin-Elmer LS-50B spectrofluorimeter. For fluorescein-labeled protein, the excitation was 480 nm, whereas for unlabeled proteins the excitation was set at 295 nm. Excitation and emission slits were set at 2.5 nm. The results of the fluorescence titration experiments were fitted to Equation 1 as follows, α/1−α=[mMDH]F/KDEquation 1 Where α = (F −F o )/(F M −F o ). F is the observed fluorescence,F o and F M the fluorescence intensities of free and bound IAF-PDI, respectively. In the analysis of the results, it was assumed that the stoichiometry of binding is 1 mol of IAF-PDI/1 mol of denatured mMDH. Since PDI is a multifunctional enzyme endowed with ATPase and chaperone activities, it was thought to be of interest to investigate whether both catalytic activities are linked during the process of refolding of a protein substrate. Is the ATPase activity enhanced during the refolding of the protein substrate? As a protein substrate of PDI, we have chosen an intermediate of denatured mMDH generated by GdnHCl denaturation of the wild type protein. Partially folded mMDH, containing 12% α-helix, exhibits exposed hydrophobic amino acid residues and is devoid of catalytic activity (15Li W. Churchich J.E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 246: 127-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Moreover, the unfolded conformations of mMDH recognizes GroEL and regains a good deal of its catalytic activity (90%) in the presence of Mg ATP (16Hutchinson J.P. Elthaner T.S.H. Miller A.D. Biochem. J. 1994; 302: 405-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 17Churchich J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19645-19648Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 18Ranson N.A. Burston S.E. Clarke A.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 266: 656-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). The results included in Fig. 1 show the time course of recovery of dehydrogenase activity in the presence of 1 mm DTT. Under this set of experimental conditions, the recovery of catalytic activity is due to spontaneous refolding of the protein after reduction of disulfide bonds generated during GdnHCl treatment (15Li W. Churchich J.E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 246: 127-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). A significant recovery of catalytic activity was observed in the presence of increasing concentrations of PDI. Maximum recovery of dehydrogenase activity, which amounts to approximately 50% of the wild-type protein, takes place when the concentration of PDI (2.2 μm) was 20-fold higher than the concentration of the protein substrate. A further increase in PDI concentration has no effect either on the rate or extent of recovery of catalytic activity. No antichaperone activity was detected at PDI concentrations above 2.0 μm. When similar reactivation experiments were performed in the presence of Mg-ATP (1 mm) at the optimal mixing molar ration of PDI/protein substrate of 20:1, the final recovery of catalytic activity was practically identical to that observed in the absence of Mg-ATP (Fig. 1). To ascertain whether the binding of the protein substrate influences ATPase activity displayed by PDI, the hydrolysis of ATP (1 mm) in the absence and presence of partially folded mMDH was measured using a coupled enzymatic assay consisting of pyruvate kinase and lactate dehydrogenase. As shown by the results included in Fig.2, the ATPase activity (k CAT = 0.26 min−1) characteristic of PDI remains practically invariant upon increasing the concentration of partially folded mMDH from 2 to 8 μm. In marked contrast to the lack of inhibition of ATPase activity caused by the binding of mMDH, the glutathione-dependent reduction of insulin is strongly inhibited by small concentrations of partially folded mMDH as shown in Fig. 2. This finding suggests that insulin and denatured mMDH might share common binding sites on PDI. Although partially folded mMDH has been used in most of the studies reported in this work, it should be emphasized that the rate of reactivation of malic dehydrogenase is not affected by the nature of the initial unfolded species used in the refolding experiments. Indeed, the kinetics of reactivation of partially folded mMDH, prepared as described under “Experimental Procedures,” is similar to that observed when 3 m guanidinium chloride-treated enzyme is immediately diluted into the renaturation buffer containing PDI (Fig.1). PDI contains tryptophanyl residues, which exhibit a structureless emission band centered at around 340 nm when excited at 295 nm. The intensity of the emission band is enhanced by the addition of equimolar amounts of denatured mMDH (Fig. 3). mMDH does not contain tryptophanyl groups; and under the experimental conditions chosen for the luminescence experiments, the enzyme does not display any emission band centered at 340 nm. A gradual increase in tryptophanyl fluorescence is observed when the concentration of denatured protein varies from 0 to 1.5 μm. As shown in the inset of Fig. 3, the fluorescence intensity reaches a maximum value at a mixing molar ratio of the proteins of approximately 1:1, taking the molecular masses of mMDH and PDI as 35 and 55 kDa, respectively. In order to determine the affinity of mMDH for PDI at a concentration comparable with those used in the reactivation experiments, it was desirable to label PDI with a fluorescent probe characterized by high fluorescence yield at protein concentrations ranging from 0.05 to 0.1 μm. Derivatized IAF-PDI exhibits a maximum of fluorescence at around 535 nm due to the presence of the fluorescence chromophore. The fluorescence quantum yield of the probe (Q = 0.35), excited in the spectral region (460–480 nm) located far away from the aromatic amino acid residues tyrosine and tryptophan, can be used to detect the presence of protein-protein complexes in solution. Moreover, IAF is bound to cysteinyl residues, which can be localized on the polypeptide chain by sequencing the protein. The emission of the chromophore excited at 480 nm is increased upon the addition of increasing concentrations of denatured proteins. Fig.4 shows the emission spectra of IAF-PDI (0.96 μm) recorded after the addition of denatured mMDH and scrambled RNase A. To measure the affinity of IAF-PDI for partially folded mMDH, mixtures containing IAF-PDI (0.05 μm) and increasing concentrations of denatured protein were allowed to equilibrate for 2 min at 25 °C, and their spectra were immediately recorded. As shown in Fig. 4, inset, the fluorescence emitted by IAF-PDI is increased until it remains practically constant when the concentration of partially folded mMDH is greater than 0.6 μm. Assuming a stoichiometry of binding of 1:1, the dissociation constant of the protein-protein complex was estimated to be 0.2 μm. To ascertain whether labeling of PDI by the extrinsic probe IAF has taken place in the central domains of the protein, derivatized PDI was subjected to trypsin digestion, and the peptides were separated by HPLC as outlined under “Experimental Procedures.” Upon separation of tryptic peptides by HPLC using a reverse-phase column, one major labeled peptide was identified (Fig. 5). Rechromatography of the labeled peptide with the same column using a different solvent composition resulted in further purification. The fractions, characterized by a fluorescence maximum at 535 nm, due to the presence of the extrinsic chromophore fluorescein, were pooled, lyophilized, and sequenced. Edman degradation gave the following amino acid sequence: Ile-Thr-Glu-Phe-X-His-Arg. Comparison of the determined sequence of the modified peptide with the reported primary structure of human PDI (19Edman J.C. Ellis L. Blacher R.W. Roth R.A. Rutter W.J. Nature. 1985; 317: 267-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar) indicated that the labeled peptide corresponds to amino acid residues 322–328 of the human enzyme. The position indicated as X in the peptide sequence corresponds to cysteine 326 in the human enzyme. The absence of any labeled peptide covering the sequence Trp-Cys-Gly-His-Cys-Lys pertaining to the active site region of thioredoxin, strongly suggests that the reaction with IAF is restricted to free cysteine groups in the central domain b′ of PDI. It has been reported that monomeric species of PDI are in dynamic equilibrium with dimeric and tetrameric species at pH 7.4 in 0.3 m NaCl (9Guthapfel R. Gueguen P. Quemeneur E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2663-2666Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The possibility that high molecular “clusters” of PDI preferentially bind small molecular weight peptides was investigated by gel filtration chromatography using 0.1 m Tris/HCl, pH 7, as the mobile phase. When pure PDI, stored at 4 °C, was submitted to gel filtration, one major peak was detected. The retention time of PDI is slightly different from bovine serum albumin (monomeric) characterized by a molecular mass of 67 kDa (Fig. 6). The addition of the peptide mastoparan (Ile-Asn-Leu-Lys-Ala-Leu-Ala-Ala-Leu-Ala-Lys-Lys-Ile-Leu) does not cause any change in the monomeric state of PDI, even at concentrations required for saturation of the enzyme (20Klappa P. Stromer T. Zimmerman R. Ruddock L.W. Freedman R.B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 254: 63-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Hence, PDI does not undergo a reversible process of association in the absence or presence of low molecular weight peptides. When the same experiments were performed with IAF-PDI mixed with mMDH and the elution profiles were monitored by fluorescence measurements at 535 nm, we were unable to detect macromolecular species corresponding to tetramers of PDI (results not shown). Our results do not show dimerization or aggregation of PDI at neutral pH. The discrepancy with other published data must be attributed to the conditions of storage of purified PDI, since it has been reported that a metastable dimer is induced by freezing the samples in phosphate buffer (21Morjana N.A. McKeone B.J. Gilbert H.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 90: 2107-2111Crossref Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Mitochondrial MDH, a dimeric protein, undergoes structural transitions in solutions containing GdnHCl. In the presence of 3m GdnHCl, the protein shows little residual secondary structure; and dilution of the denatured protein with buffer restores a fraction of the α-helix content (15Li W. Churchich J.E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 246: 127-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). The partially folded species recover only 16% of the catalytic activity after the addition of 1 mm DTT. The rate of recovery of catalytic activity of the dehydrogenase is influenced by the presence of PDI in the renaturation buffer. Under optimal conditions of temperature (25 °C) and PDI concentration (2.2 μm), the recovery of activity amounts to 50% of the wild-type protein. Like other well characterized chaperone proteins, i.e. GroEL, PDI functions primarily by unfolding misfolded protein intermediates; but it appears that binding of the protein substrate to the chaperon would provide the free energy required for unfolding. Two lines of experimental evidence are consistent with this hypothesis: first, the rate of reactivation of partially folded mMDH is not influenced by the presence of Mg-ATP together with PDI in the refolding buffer, and second, the intrinsic ATPase activity of PDI is not perturbed by its interaction with the protein substrate. In agreement with the results published by other laboratories (16Hutchinson J.P. Elthaner T.S.H. Miller A.D. Biochem. J. 1994; 302: 405-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 17Churchich J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19645-19648Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), it was found that unfolded mMDH recovers a good deal of its catalytic activity (90%) when the denatured protein substrate interacts with GroEL and Mg-ATP at equimolar concentrations of the proteins. In view of these results, it is pertinent to ask why PDI is less efficient than GroEL in assisting the refolding of partially folded mMDH. Based on the studies reported by other laboratories on the binding of small molecular weight peptides to PDI, it has been suggested that weak affinity of PDI for denatured proteins might explain low recovery of catalytic activity. Our studies on mMDH indicate that derivatized IAF-PDI binds denatured mMDH with a dissociation constant of 0.2 μm, which is 5-fold higher than the dissociation constant determined for denatured mMDH bound to GroEL in the absence of Mg-ATP (17Churchich J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19645-19648Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Hence, a 20-fold molar excess of PDI over the denatured protein substrate (0.1 μm) would be sufficient to ensure binding and reactivation of mMDH. However, the reactivation experiments conducted in the presence of a 20-fold excess of PDI have shown partial recovery of catalytic activity. There are some aspects of the interaction of chaperone proteins with unfolded substrates that should be considered in the analysis of the behavior of PDI. GroEL interacts with denatured mMDH, and the binding of Mg-ATP drives the chaperone complex through a functional state in which refolding of the protein substrate occurs inside the cavity of GroEL (18Ranson N.A. Burston S.E. Clarke A.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 266: 656-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Encapsulation of the protein substrate provides a folding environment that facilitates conformational arrangements and prevents no unspecific interactions with other nonnative proteins during the chaperone cycle. PDI does not possess a cavity for encapsulation of a protein substrate of the size of mMDH. On the other hand, the binding of small molecular weight polypeptides does not promote association of PDI into “clusters” of large molecular weight that would prevent exposure of the protein substrate to the surrounding solvent. Several laboratories have reported that the interaction of misfolded proteins (i.e. scrambled RNase A) with PDI competes with the binding of peptides (11Gilbert H.F. Methods Enzymol. 1998; 290: 26-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 20Klappa P. Stromer T. Zimmerman R. Ruddock L.W. Freedman R.B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 254: 63-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Based on these observations, it has been suggested that the peptide binding site corresponds to a site at which PDI interacts with unfolded regions of proteins during its action in the cell. Although the hypothesis is attractive, the domain associated with peptide binding has not been completely elucidated. Initially it was reported that deletion of 51 amino acid residues of the C-terminal domain totally prevented peptide binding and chaperone activity (6Dai Y. Wang C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272 (27576): 27572Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Subsequent studies have shown that the deletion includes amino acid residues pertaining to the C-terminal domain and a fraction of the a′ domain (7Koivunen P. Pirneskoski A. Karvonen P. Ljung J. Helakoski T. Trontbohm H. Kivirikko K.J. EMBO, J. 1999; 18: 65-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). More recently, it has been reported that the b′ domain provides the principal peptide binding site of PDI (8Klappa P. Ruddeck L.W. Darby N.J. Freedman R.B. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 927-935Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). In view of these observations, it seems very likely that amino acid residues outside the C domain might contribute to the interaction of PDI with the protein substrate. Our fluorescence results have shown that binding of the protein substrate causes conformational changes in PDI propagated to different domains of its structure. Not only the fluorescent probe positioned in the b′ domain, but also tryptophanyl residues distributed along the a and a domains, sense the conformational changes induced by the protein substrate. It is conceivable that the flexibility of the protein plays an important role in reactions such as isomerization of disulfide bonds and refolding of protein substrates. We appreciate the help of Terrence Lau in the purification of the tryptic peptides."
