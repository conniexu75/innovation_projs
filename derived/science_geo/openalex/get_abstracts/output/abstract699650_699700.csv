https://openalex.org/W4293476190,"Axicabtagene ciloleucel (axi-cel) is an anti-CD19 chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapy approved for relapsed/refractory large B cell lymphoma (LBCL) and has treatment with similar efficacy across conventional LBCL subtypes. Toward patient stratification, we assessed whether tumor immune contexture influenced clinical outcomes after axi-cel. We evaluated the tumor microenvironment (TME) of 135 pre-treatment and post-treatment tumor biopsies taken from 51 patients in the ZUMA-1 phase 2 trial. We uncovered dynamic patterns that occurred within 2 weeks after axi-cel. The biological associations among Immunoscore (quantification of tumor-infiltrating T cell density), Immunosign 21 (expression of pre-defined immune gene panel) and cell subsets were validated in three independent LBCL datasets. In the ZUMA-1 trial samples, clinical response and overall survival were associated with pre-treatment immune contexture as characterized by Immunoscore and Immunosign 21. Circulating CAR T cell levels were associated with post-treatment TME T cell exhaustion. TME enriched for chemokines (CCL5 and CCL22), γ-chain receptor cytokines (IL-15, IL-7 and IL-21) and interferon-regulated molecules were associated with T cell infiltration and markers of activity. Finally, high density of regulatory T cells in pre-treatment TME associated with reduced axi-cel-related neurologic toxicity. These findings advance the understanding of LBCL TME characteristics associated with clinical responses to anti-CD19 CAR T cell therapy and could foster biomarker development and treatment optimization for patients with LBCL."
https://openalex.org/W4293475192,"Genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have identified hundreds of loci associated with Crohn’s disease (CD). However, as with all complex diseases, robust identification of the genes dysregulated by noncoding variants typically driving GWAS discoveries has been challenging. Here, to complement GWASs and better define actionable biological targets, we analyzed sequence data from more than 30,000 patients with CD and 80,000 population controls. We directly implicate ten genes in general onset CD for the first time to our knowledge via association to coding variation, four of which lie within established CD GWAS loci. In nine instances, a single coding variant is significantly associated, and in the tenth, ATG4C, we see additionally a significantly increased burden of very rare coding variants in CD cases. In addition to reiterating the central role of innate and adaptive immune cells as well as autophagy in CD pathogenesis, these newly associated genes highlight the emerging role of mesenchymal cells in the development and maintenance of intestinal inflammation. Large-scale sequence-based analyses identify novel risk variants and susceptibility genes for Crohn’s disease, and implicate mesenchymal cell-mediated intestinal homeostasis in disease etiology."

In this pilot study, we used responsive deep brain stimulation (DBS) to record nucleus accumbens (NAc) electrophysiology during food cravings preceding LOC eating in two patients with BED and severe obesity (trial registration no. NCT03868670). Increased NAc low-frequency oscillations, prominent during food cravings, were used to guide DBS delivery. Over 6 months, we observed improved self-control of food intake and weight loss. These findings provide early support for restoring inhibitory control with electrophysiologically-guided NAc DBS. Further work with increased sample sizes is required to determine the scalability of this approach."
https://openalex.org/W4293469392,"The COVID-19 pandemic has been fueled by SARS-CoV-2 novel variants of concern (VOC) that have increased transmissibility, receptor binding affinity, and other properties that enhance disease. The goal of this study is to characterize unique pathogenesis of the Delta VOC strain in the K18-hACE2-mouse challenge model. Challenge studies suggested that the lethal dose of Delta was higher than Alpha or Beta strains. To characterize the differences in the Delta strain’s pathogenesis, a time-course experiment was performed to evaluate the overall host response to Alpha or Delta variant challenge. qRT-PCR analysis of Alpha- or Delta-challenged mice revealed no significant difference between viral RNA burden in the lung, nasal wash or brain. However, histopathological analysis revealed high lung tissue inflammation and cell infiltration following Delta- but not Alpha-challenge at day 6. Additionally, pro-inflammatory cytokines were highest at day 6 in Delta-challenged mice suggesting enhanced pneumonia. Total RNA-sequencing analysis of lungs comparing challenged to no challenge mice revealed that Alpha-challenged mice have more total genes differentially activated. Conversely, Delta-challenged mice have a higher magnitude of differential gene expression. Delta-challenged mice have increased interferon-dependent gene expression and IFN-γ production compared to Alpha. Analysis of TCR clonotypes suggested that Delta challenged mice have increased T-cell infiltration compared to Alpha challenged. Our data suggest that Delta has evolved to engage interferon responses in a manner that may enhance pathogenesis. The in vivo and in silico observations of this study underscore the need to conduct experiments with VOC strains to best model COVID-19 when evaluating therapeutics and vaccines."

https://openalex.org/W4293493506,"School and college reopening-closure policies are considered one of the most promising non-pharmaceutical interventions for mitigating infectious diseases. Nonetheless, the effectiveness of these policies is still debated, largely due to the lack of empirical evidence on behavior during implementation. We examined U.S. college reopenings' association with changes in human mobility within campuses and in COVID-19 incidence in the counties of the campuses over a twenty-week period around college reopenings in the Fall of 2020. We used an integrative framework, with a difference-in-differences design comparing areas with a college campus, before and after reopening, to areas without a campus and a Bayesian approach to estimate the daily reproductive number (Rt). We found that college reopenings were associated with increased campus mobility, and increased COVID-19 incidence by 4.9 cases per 100,000 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.9-6.9), or a 37% increase relative to the pre-period mean. This reflected our estimate of increased transmission locally after reopening. A greater increase in county COVID-19 incidence resulted from campuses that drew students from counties with high COVID-19 incidence in the weeks before reopening (χ2(2) = 8.9, p = 0.012) and those with a greater share of college students, relative to population (χ2(2) = 98.83, p < 0.001). Even by Fall of 2022, large shares of populations remained unvaccinated, increasing the relevance of understanding non-pharmaceutical decisions over an extended period of a pandemic. Our study sheds light on movement and social mixing patterns during the closure-reopening of colleges during a public health threat, and offers strategic instruments for benefit-cost analyses of school reopening/closure policies."
https://openalex.org/W4293579656,"Medical students have made particular use of smartphones during the COVID-19 pandemic. Although higher smartphone overuse has been observed, its effect on mental disorders is unclear. This study aimed to assess the association between smartphone overuse and mental disorders in Peruvian medical students during the COVID-19 pandemic.A cross-sectional study was conducted in 370 students aged between 16 and 41 years (median age: 20) in three universities from July to October 2020. A survey including Smartphone Dependence and Addiction Scale, PHQ-9, and GAD-7 was applied. Prevalence ratios were estimated using generalized linear models.Smartphone overuse was a common feature among students (n = 291, 79%). Depressive symptoms were present in 290 (78%) students and anxiety symptoms in 255 (69%). Adjusted for confounders, addictive/dependent smartphone use was significantly associated with presence of depressive symptoms (PR = 1.29, 95% CI: 1.20-1.38 for dependent use; PR = 1.30, 95% CI: 1.12-1.50 for addictive use). Also, addictive/dependent smartphone use was significantly associated with presence of anxiety symptoms (PR = 1.59, 95% CI: 1.14-2.23 for dependent use; PR = 1.61, 95% CI: 1.07-2.41 for addictive use).Our findings suggest that medical students exposed to smartphone overuse are vulnerable to mental disorders. Overuse may reflect an inappropriate way of finding emotional relief, which may significantly affect quality of life and academic performance. Findings would assist faculties to establish effective measures for prevention of smartphone overuse."
https://openalex.org/W4293493271,"Few studies have examined the intentions of parents and guardians to vaccinate their children younger than 18 years against COVID-19 in Ghana. Parents are the decision makers for children younger than 18 years; therefore, we examined parents' and guardians' intentions to accept the COVID-19 vaccines for their children. An online survey was conducted among 415 parents and guardians in Ghana. The Statistical Package for Social Sciences version 25 was used to analyse the data. We found that 73.3% of parents/guardians would allow their children to be vaccinated against COVID-19. The binary logistic regression analysis shows that parents/guardians with Senior High School education, those who believed COVID-19 could not be cured, and those who agreed and those who neither agreed nor disagreed with the statement ""once the vaccine is available and approved, it would be safe"" were less likely to accept COVID-19 vaccine for their children. Also, parents/guardians who neither agreed nor disagreed that ""the best way to avoid the complications of COVID-19 is by being vaccinated"", those who agreed that ""I am of the notion that physiological/natural community is better compared to vaccine-induced immunity"" and ""I believe the vaccine programming may be likened to the new world order"" were less likely to accept COVID-19 vaccine for their children. There is a need for public health practitioners to intensify education on the benefits and side effects of COVID-19 vaccines, as well as provide regular and up-to-date information about vaccines' safety to parents and guardians."
https://openalex.org/W4293579648,"In recent years, smart home technologies have offered opportunities for elderly people to manage their daily health-related activities. Despite the advancement in smart home technology (SHT), the level of end-user acceptance among elderly people is still low. This study proposes an SHT framework by examining the determinants of elderly behavioural intention (BI) to use smart home technologies by extending the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) model. This study uses the quantitative approach to survey about 486 elderly people in Saudi Arabia, and it applies the Partial Least Square Structural Equation Model (PLS-SEM) technique to perform the data analysis. Findings reveal that culture influence and technology awareness are significant factors in determining the BI to use SHT among elderly people. The study also finds that attitude mediates the relationships between performance expectancy, effort expectancy, and behavioural intention. We find that region and education moderate the relationships between culture influence, technology awareness, and behavioural intention. This study theoretically extends the UTAUT theory by including external constructs: culture influence, technology awareness, attitude, education, and region."

https://openalex.org/W4293385828,"The methyl-CpG-binding domain 2 and 3 proteins (MBD2 and MBD3) provide structural and DNA-binding function for the Nucleosome Remodeling and Deacetylase (NuRD) complex. The two proteins form distinct NuRD complexes and show different binding affinity and selectivity for methylated DNA. Previous studies have shown that MBD2 binds with high affinity and selectivity for a single methylated CpG dinucleotide while MBD3 does not. However, the NuRD complex functions in regions of the genome that contain many CpG dinucleotides (CpG islands). Therefore, in this work, we investigate the binding and diffusion of MBD2 and MBD3 on more biologically relevant DNA templates that contain a large CpG island or limited CpG sites. Using a combination of single-molecule and biophysical analyses, we show that both MBD2 and MBD3 diffuse freely and rapidly across unmethylated CpG-rich DNA. In contrast, we found methylation of large CpG islands traps MBD2 leading to stable and apparently static binding on the CpG island while MBD3 continues to diffuse freely. In addition, we demonstrate both proteins bend DNA, which is augmented by methylation. Together, these studies support a model in which MBD2-NuRD strongly localizes to and compacts methylated CpG islands while MBD3-NuRD can freely mobilize nucleosomes independent of methylation status."
https://openalex.org/W4293577530,"Γ-Crystallins play a major role in age-related lens transparency. Their destabilization by mutations and physical chemical insults are associated with cataract formation. Therefore, drugs that increase their stability should have anticataract properties. To this end, we screened 2560 Federal Drug Agency-approved drugs and natural compounds for their ability to suppress or worsen H2O2 and/or heat-mediated aggregation of bovine γ-crystallins. The top two drugs, closantel (C), an antihelminthic drug, and gambogic acid (G), a xanthonoid, attenuated thermal-induced protein unfolding and aggregation as shown by turbidimetry fluorescence spectroscopy dynamic light scattering and electron microscopy of human or mouse recombinant crystallins. Furthermore, binding studies using fluorescence inhibition and hydrophobic pocket-binding molecule bis-8-anilino-1-naphthalene sulfonic acid revealed static binding of C and G to hydrophobic sites with medium-to-low affinity. Molecular docking to HγD and other γ-crystallins revealed two binding sites, one in the ""NC pocket"" (residues 50-150) of HγD and one spanning the ""NC tail"" (residues 56-61 to 168-174 in the C-terminal domain). Multiple binding sites overlap with those of the protective mini αA-crystallin chaperone MAC peptide. Mechanistic studies using bis-8-anilino-1-naphthalene sulfonic acid as a proxy drug showed that it bound to MAC sites, improved Tm of both H2O2 oxidized and native human gamma D, and suppressed turbidity of oxidized HγD, most likely by trapping exposed hydrophobic sites. The extent to which these drugs act as α-crystallin mimetics and reduce cataract progression remains to be demonstrated. This study provides initial insights into binding properties of C and G to γ-crystallins."
https://openalex.org/W4293385871,"Stroke can lead to severe nerve injury and debilitation, resulting in considerable social and economic burdens. Due to the high complexity of post-injury repair mechanisms, drugs approved for use in stroke are extremely scarce, and thus, the discovery of new antistroke drugs and targets is critical. Tryptophan hydroxylase 1 (TPH1) is involved in a variety of mental and neurobehavioral processes, but its effects on stroke have not yet been reported. Here, we used primary astrocyte culture, quantitative real-time PCR, double immunofluorescence assay, lentiviral infection, cell viability analysis, Western blotting, and other biochemical experiments to explore the protective mechanism of peptide OM-LV20, which previously exhibited neuroprotective effects in rats after ischemic stroke via a mechanism that may involve TPH1. First, we showed that TPH1 was expressed in rat astrocytes. Next, we determined that OM-LV20 impacted expression changes of TPH1 in CTX-TNA2 cells and exhibited a protective effect on the decrease in cell viability and catalase (CAT) levels induced by hydrogen peroxide. Importantly, we also found that TPH1 expression induced by OM-LV20 may be related to the level of change in the pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating peptide type 1 receptor (PAC1R) and to the JNK signaling pathways, thereby exerting a protective effect on astrocytes against oxidative stress. The protective effects of OM-LV20 likely occur via the ‘PAC1R/JNK/TPH1’ axis, thus highlighting TPH1 as a novel antistroke drug target.

Cerebrovascular illnesses, particularly stroke, have gained increasing scientific attention given the world’s aging population (1Li H. Ma J. Fang Q. Li H. Shen H.

Currently, one out of six people will experience a stroke throughout their lifetime, and one out of every 10 patients will die from stroke (3Seshadri S. Wolf P.A. Lifetime risk of stroke and dementia: Current concepts, and estimates from the framingham study.Lancet Neurol. 2007; 6: 1106-1114Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). Stroke treatment alone accounts for 5% to 6% of all medical costs for patients, and the majority will suffer from long-term severe disability, inflicting substantial physical and mental burdens upon them and their families (4Zhao H.

Pharmacol. 2016; 779: 80-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Ischemic stroke (IS) is the most common type of stroke (87% incidence rate) and one of the leading causes of mortality among the elderly (6Liu W. Wang X. Yang S. Huang J. Xue X. Zheng Y. et al.Electroacupunctre improves motor impairment via inhibition of microglia-mediated neuroinflammation in the sensorimotor cortex after ischemic stroke.Life Sci. 2016; 151: 313-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Despite the serious consequences of IS, viable therapies remain limited. As a result, the development of effective therapies for IS injury is a major focus of scientific research. As an important class of neuroglia, astrocytes play a critical role in the central nervous system (CNS) (7Blanco-Suarez E. Caldwell A.L. Allen N.J. Role of astrocyte-synapse interactions in CNS disorders.J. Physiol. 2017; 595: 1903-1916Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). After IS, astrocytes release a variety of nerve factors to resist oxidative stress and inflammatory processes but also shield neurons from injury throughout the IS process (8Pekny M. Wilhelmsson U. Tatlisumak T. Pekna M. Astrocyte activation and reactive gliosis-A new target in stroke?.Neurosci. Lett. 2019; 689: 45-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Therefore, helping astrocytes survive and sustain normal function is considered one of the most beneficial strategies against cerebral IS injury. Serotonin (5-HT) is a monoamine neurotransmitter in the brain. It can promote angiogenesis and neurogenesis, inhibit neuroinflammation, and reduce oxidative stress in brain cells and is thus important for normal CNS operation (9Rahman M.S. Thomas P. Molecular cloning, characterization and expression of two tryptophan hydroxylase (TPH-1 and TPH-2) genes in the hypothalamus of atlantic croaker: Down-regulation after chronic exposure to hypoxia.Neuroscience. 2009; 158: 751-765Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Tryptophan hydroxylase (TPH), a key rate-limiting enzyme for 5-HT synthesis, can be divided into TPH1 and TPH2 subtypes (9Rahman M.S. Thomas P. Molecular cloning, characterization and expression of two tryptophan hydroxylase (TPH-1 and TPH-2) genes in the hypothalamus of atlantic croaker: Down-regulation after chronic exposure to hypoxia.Neuroscience. 2009; 158: 751-765Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). TPH1 is mainly expressed in peripheral tissues expressing 5-HT, such as the skin and intestines, but is rarely expressed in the CNS(10). Recently, however, several studies have reported that TPH1 is correlated with the CNS(11–15). Notably, in our and other previous studies, the level of TPH1 in brain tissue was found to be significantly decreased in rats after stroke (10Zhang C. Wen Y. Fan X. Yang S. Tian G. Zhou X. et al.A microarray study of middle cerebral occlusion rat brain with acupuncture intervention.Evid. Based Complement. Alternat. Med. 2015; 2015 (496932): 1-13Google Scholar, 11Yin S. Yang M.

Commun. 2021; 537: 36-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar), suggesting that TPH1 may have a protective effect on nerve damage following stroke. Due to the novel structure and functional diversity, peptides are widely used to elucidate human disease mechanisms (12Yang X. Wang Y. Wu C. Ling E.A. Animal venom peptides as a treasure trove for new therapeutics against neurodegenerative disorders.Curr. Med. Chem. 2019; 26: 4749-4774Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 13Zhang Y. Wang Q.Q. Zhao Z. Deng C.J. Animal secretory endolysosome channel discovery.Zool Res. 2021; 42: 141-152Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For example, nerve growth factor in snake venom has been used to clarify diseases such as pheochromocytoma (14Katzir I. Shani J. Goshen G. Sela J. Ninary E. Dogonovski A.M. et al.Characterization of nerve growth factors (NGFs) from snake venoms by use of a novel, quantitative bioassay utilizing pheochromocytoma (PC12) cells overexpressing human trkA receptors.Toxicon. 2003; 42: 481-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar); captopril, an antihypertensive drug angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, has been applied to elucidate the pathophysiological mechanism of the human cardiovascular system; and hypoglycemic agent insulin has played an important role in diabetes (12Yang X. Wang Y. Wu C. Ling E.A. Animal venom peptides as a treasure trove for new therapeutics against neurodegenerative disorders.Curr. Med. Chem. 2019; 26: 4749-4774Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 15Strowig S. Insulin therapy.RN. 1995; 58: 30-36PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, as molecular probes, peptides are closely related to the analysis of human diseases. We previously identified a small molecule peptide, named OM-LV20, which showed significant neuroprotective effects in rats following IS, with its underlying mechanism involving the regulation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPKs) and BDNF/Akt signaling pathways as well as TPH1, pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating peptide type 1 receptor (PCA1R), and cAMP levels (11Yin S. Yang M. Li Y. Li S. Fu Z. Liu N. et al.Peptide OM-LV20 exerts neuroprotective effects against cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury in rats.Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2021; 537: 36-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Here, to explore the protective mechanisms at the cellular level, we studied the effects of OM-LV20 on astrocytes under oxidative stress. Interestingly, TPH1 was expressed in the rat astrocytes, and OM-LV20, as an exogenous molecular probe, played a neuroprotective role via the molecular ‘PAC1R/JNK/TPH1’ axis. We investigated the specific protective mechanism of OM-LV20 regarding the improvement of astrocytes after IS and explored TPH1 as a novel neuroprotective target. Thus, this research provides a potential new drug molecule and targeting strategy for IS treatment and prevention. We first explored TPH1 expression at the tissue level. As shown in Fig. 1A, TPH1 was expressed in the rat brain, with significant distribution in the thalamus, raphe, and CA1 region of the hippocampus. Then, we applied immunofluorescence double labeling to colocalize TPH1, glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) (astrocytes), and 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) (nucleus) in the hippocampus and primary astrocytes. TPH1 was successfully colocalized with astrocytes in the hippocampus and primary cells (marked by arrow), demonstrating that TPH1 was expressed in the rat astrocytes (Fig. 1, B and C). Secondly, primary astrocytes and two astrocyte cell lines (DI-TNC1 and CTX-TNA2) from rats were used to clarify the expression of TPH1 at the cell level. The expression of TPH1 in the human myeloid leukemia mononuclear cells (THP-1) cells was validated; hence, the THP-1 cells were employed as a positive control. As illustrated in Fig. 1D, TPH1 was expressed in the primary astrocytes and astrocyte cell lines. The quantitative real-time PCR (RT-qPCR) amplicon products of the primary astrocytes and DI-TNC1 and CTX-TNA2 cell lines were matched with the rat TPH1 gene in the NCBI database (sequence ID: NM_001100634.2) (Fig. 1E). Thus, these findings indicate that TPH1 is expressed in rat astrocytes. As shown in Fig. 2, A and B, TPH1 expression decreased at 2 h after H2O2 stimulation but then increased at 4, 6, 12, and 24 h, consistent with the RT-qPCR results in Fig. 2C. The CTX-TNA2 cells were pretreated with different concentrations of OM-LV20 (10 pM, 100 pM and 1 nM) for 12 h. Results showed that 100 pM and 1 nM OM-LV20 promoted the TPH1 mRNA and protein expression levels (Fig. 2, D–F). Before H2O2 treatment, cells were preadministered with 1 nM OM-LV20 for 12 h (37 °C). As illustrated in Fig. 3A, compared with the control group, H2O2 treatment significantly reduced cell viability by 56.33% ± 14.44%. After OM-LV20 application, cell viability increased by 10.07% ± 8.37%, indicating that OM-LV20 protected cell viability against oxidative stress. H2O2 stimulation significantly decreased the level of catalase (CAT), whereas OM-LV20 treatment effectively reversed this decrease (increased by 26.92% ± 13.56%) (Fig. 3B). After H2O2 stimulation, the mRNA level of PAC1R increased 12.57 ± 2.03-fold compared to that in the control group (Fig. 4B). OM-LV20 pretreatment increased the PAC1R mRNA and protein levels by 54.33 ± 28.18-fold and 0.42 ± 0.07-fold, respectively (Fig. 4, A–C). TPH1 expression was significantly decreased following H2O2 treatment, whereas OM-LV20 pretreatment alleviated this reduction, resulting in a 0.39 ± 0.15-fold increase (Fig. 4, A and D). H2O2 stimulation increased the mRNA level of PAC1R, while OM-LV20 application increased both the mRNA and protein levels of PAC1R. Thus, the peptide increased both PAC1R and TPH1 to resist damage caused by H2O2. To investigate the MAPK signaling pathway following H2O2 treatment, cells were pretreated with OM-LV20 (1 nM) at 37 °C for 12 h before H2O2 stimulation, with the levels of p-JNK and p-p38 then detected. After H2O2 treatment, the levels of p-JNK and p-p38 markedly increased (p < 0.05 and p < 0.001, respectively) but both decreased under OM-LV20 pretreatment (0.40 ± 0.16-fold and 0.37 ± 0.12-fold, respectively (Fig. 4, A,E, and F). As shown in Fig. 4, the application of OM-LV20 reduced the level of p-JNK but increased the TPH1 level at the same time. So, to study the relevance between p-JNK and TPH1 levels regulated by OM-LV20, an inhibitor (SP600125) and an activator (anisomycin [ANS]) of the JNK signaling pathway were used. Compared with the control group, administration of ANS increased the p-JNK level; however, in the OM-LV20 + ANS group, p-JNK expression decreased compared with that in the ANS group. Thus, OM-LV20 likely played a role in the decline of p-JNK (Fig. 5, A and B). Furthermore, simultaneous application of OM-LV20 and ANS decreased TPH1 in the CTX-TNA2 cells (Fig. 5, A and C), illustrating that the increase in p-JNK expression may partly weaken the promotion of TPH1 by OM-LV20. Comparing the ANS and SP60025 + ANS groups, we found that SP600125 also reversed the increase in p-JNK and decrease in TPH1 caused by ANS, indicating that the level of p-JNK had an effect on TPH1 expression (Fig. 5). Based on the aforementioned results, the level of p-JNK was negatively correlated with the level of TPH1 in CTX-TNA2 cells, and thus, OM-LV20 likely regulates TPH1 by inhibiting the level of p-JNK. In view of the increase in TPH1 levels in cells and tissues following OM-LV20 administration, molecular docking simulation was used to explore the possible relationship between OM-LV20 and PAC1R. Results showed that OM-LV20 and PAC1R had a good shape complementarity (Fig. 6A). As seen in Fig. 6B, OM-LV20 likely forms hydrogen bonds with PAC1R through TYR-118, ALA-9, ILE-19, LYS-4, LEU-1, ASN-60, and SER-23. Furthermore, as seen in Fig. 6C, the peptide likely shows hydrophobic accumulation and Van der Waals interactions with PAC1R through TYR-118, PHE-115, VAL-13, VAL-10, LEU-6, LEU-5, PHE-81, PHE-110, LEU-16, LEU-17, ILE-19, VAL-2, LEU-1, and TYR-109. These are crucial to the binding stability of OM-LV20 with PAC1R. By using a PAC1R antagonist (PACAP6-38), we also investigated whether OM-LV20 influenced TPH1 through PAC1R. Results demonstrated that TPH1 expression increased 0.33 ± 0.13-fold after OM-LV20 treatment, whereas concurrent treatment with OM-LV20 and PACAP6-38 partly reversed this increase (Fig. 6, D and E). These results confirm that OM-LV20 may regulate TPH1 by binding to PAC1R. After TPH1 overexpression, RT-qPCR and Western blot analyses were performed to detect TPH1 expression in the CTX-TNA2 cells. Compared with the control group, the mRNA and protein levels of TPH1 increased 41.4 ± 3.0-fold and 0.96 ± 0.17-fold, respectively (Fig. 7, A–C). No significant differences were observed between the vector (negative control) and control groups, demonstrating that TPH1 was effectively overexpressed in the cells, which were used in subsequent experiments. Treatment with H2O2 led to a decrease in cell viability and CAT level. As shown in Fig. 7D, overexpression of TPH1 had no protective effect on cell viability damage. As a classic antioxidant factor that maintains homeostasis of the oxidative system in cells and the body, a decrease in CAT indicates that oxidative stress has caused the body system to enter an imbalanced state (16Gu W. Zhao H. Yenari M.A. Sapolsky R.M. Steinberg G.K. Catalase over-expression protects striatal neurons from transient focal cerebral ischemia.Neuroreport. 2004; 15: 413-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). As seen in Fig. 7E, CAT level decreased by 62.79% ± 8.21% after H2O2 treatment but increased by 19.92% ± 4.11% after TPH1-overexpression. IS is one of the main causes of disability worldwide, and its incidence increases with age (17Zhou M. Wang H. Zeng X. Yin P. Zhu J. Chen W. et al.Mortality, morbidity, and risk factors in China and its provinces, 1990-2017: A systematic analysis for the global burden of disease study 2017.Lancet. 2019; 394: 1145-1158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1983) Google Scholar). Despite considerable effort, prevention and therapy remain ineffective and a serious clinical challenge (17Zhou M. Wang H. Zeng X. Yin P. Zhu J.

Therefore, the identification of new targets and the development of novel candidate drugs for effective IS treatment is critical. In our previous study on the protective effects of OM-LV20 on cerebral ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) injury in rats, TPH1 was significantly upregulated following OM-LV20 treatment (compared with the model group) and significantly decreased after cerebral I/R (11Yin S. Yang M. Li Y. Li S. Fu Z. Liu N. et al.Peptide OM-LV20 exerts neuroprotective effects against cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury in rats.Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2021; 537: 36-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Thus, the application of OM-LV20 not only had a protective effect on brain injury but also improved TPH1 levels (11Yin S. Yang M. Li Y. Li S. Fu Z. Liu N. et al.Peptide OM-LV20 exerts neuroprotective effects against cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury in rats.Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2021; 537: 36-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). According to these results, TPH1 may be a therapeutic target for nerve injury caused by cerebral I/R. In the normal operation of the CNS, TPH1 participates in a variety of mental and neurobehavioral-related processes. For example, genetic studies have shown that some psychiatric diagnostic categories, such as TPH1, are related to serotonin function (19Liu X. Li H. Qin W. He G. Li D. Shen Y. et al.Association of TPH1 with suicidal behaviour and psychiatric disorders in the Chinese population.J. Med. Genet. 2006; 43: e4Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Other research has reported that TPH1 is associated with schizophrenia (20Fukuda K. 5-HTP hypothesis of schizophrenia.Med. Hypotheses. 2014; 82: 20-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Furthermore, in mouse models of reserpine-induced depression, scopolamine can reverse the decrease in TPH1 levels in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex (21Yu H. Lv D. Shen M. Zhang Y. Zhou D. Chen Z. et al.BDNF mediates the protective effects of scopolamine in reserpine-induced depression-like behaviors via up-regulation of 5-HTT and TPH1.Psychiatry Res. 2019; 271: 328-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). In rats, the mRNA level of TPH1 decreases in the brain after stroke but acupuncture intervention significantly increases TPH1 levels (10Zhang C. Wen Y. Fan X. Yang S. Tian G. Zhou X. et al.A microarray study of middle cerebral occlusion rat brain with acupuncture intervention.Evid. Based Complement. Alternat. Med. 2015; 2015 (496932): 1-13Google Scholar). Although TPH1 was primarily thought to be distributed in peripheral tissues and not expressed in the brain, more recent studies have suggested that it is expressed in several brain regions, such as the hippocampus, thalamus, and amygdala (21Yu H. Lv D. Shen M. Zhang Y. Zhou D. Chen Z. et al.BDNF mediates the protective effects of scopolamine in reserpine-induced depression-like behaviors via up-regulation of 5-HTT and TPH1.Psychiatry Res. 2019; 271: 328-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). In addition, TPH1 appears to be pre-expressed in later stages of brain development (22Nakamura K. Sugawara Y. Sawabe K. Ohashi A. Tsurui H. Xiu Y. et al.Late developmental stage-specific role of tryptophan hydroxylase 1 in brain serotonin levels.J. Neurosci. 2006; 26: 530-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 23Nakamura K. Hasegawa H. Developmental role of tryptophan hydroxylase in the nervous system.Mol. Neurobiol. 2007; 35: 45-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). However, whether TPH1 is definitively expressed in the brain and at which specific sites remains controversial. To clarify the aforementioned question, we explored TPH1-specific expression in the rat brain. Results showed that TPH1 was expressed in the brain, mainly in the hippocampal CA1 region, thalamic region, and cerebral raphe (Fig. 1A). The hippocampus is one of the most important structures in the brain and is closely related to cognition, learning, and memory (24Zeidman P. Maguire E.A. Anterior hippocampus: The anatomy of perception, imagination and episodic memory.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2016; 17: 173-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). The CA1 area is located in the vulnerable ‘head’ area of the hippocampus and is thus highly sensitive to hypoxia, lesions, and other injuries (25Dutra J.R. Cortes E.P. Vonsattel J.P. Update on hippocampal sclerosis.Curr. Neurol. Neurosci. Rep. 2015; 15 (67): 1-9Crossref Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 26White B.C. Grossman L.I. O'Neil B.J. DeGracia D.J. Neumar R.W. Rafols J.A. et al.Global brain ischemia and reperfusion.Ann. Emerg. Med. 1996; 27: 588-594Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Combined with the significant expression of TPH1 in the CA1 region, we speculated that TPH1 may play a role in neuroprotection, especially in maintaining hippocampal homeostasis. Astrocytes account for a large proportion of glial cells in the hippocampus (27Mederos S. Perea G. Monitoring interneuron-astrocyte signaling and its consequences on synaptic transmission.Methods Mol. Biol. 2019; 1938: 117-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). As astrocytes are the most abundant cell type in the CNS and can affect neuronal survival under physiological and pathological conditions, astrocyte-related treatment strategies are an important direction in IS treatment (7Blanco-Suarez E. Caldwell A.L. Allen N.J. Role of astrocyte-synapse interactions in CNS disorders.J. Physiol. 2017; 595: 1903-1916Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 8Pekny M. Wilhelmsson U. Tatlisumak T.

Astrocyte roles in traumatic brain injury.Exp. Neurol. 2016; 275: 305-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar). Astrocytes are also reported to have a variety of neurotransmitter receptors, such as dopamine, acetylcholine, and serotonergic receptors (29Muller N. Schwarz M.J. The immune-mediated alteration of serotonin and glutamate: Towards an integrated view of depression.Mol. Psychiatry. 2007; 12: 988-1000Crossref PubMed Scopus (546) Google Scholar). Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, which are commonly used as antidepressants, can play a neuroprotective role by activating 5-HT2B receptors in astrocytes and neurons (9Rahman M.S. Thomas P. Molecular cloning, characterization and expression of two tryptophan hydroxylase (TPH-1 and TPH-2) genes in the hypothalamus of atlantic croaker: Down-regulation after chronic exposure to hypoxia.Neuroscience. 2009; 158: 751-765Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Moreover, tryptophan, the precursor for 5-HT synthesis, can be decomposed by indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase to form canine urinary tryptophan, with indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase not only found in tissues outside the liver but also in brain endothelial cells, macrophages, and astrocytes (29Muller N. Schwarz M.J. The immune-mediated alteration of serotonin and glutamate: Towards an integrated view of depression.Mol. Psychiatry. 2007; 12: 988-1000Crossref PubMed Scopus (546) Google Scholar). Thus, we speculated that TPH1 is likely to be expressed in astrocytes, as confirmed in the current study. Notably, TPH1 was expressed in hippocampal astrocytes, primary hippocampal astrocytes, and two rat astrocyte cell lines. In addition, we compared the RT-qPCR-amplified sequence with the rat TPH1 gene sequence for confirmation (Fig. 1). These findings provided strong evidence for the existence of TPH1 in rat astrocytes (Fig. 1). Therefore, we focused on the neuroprotective effects of TPH1 on astrocytes. The pathological process of cerebral IS is complex, and its occurrence and development involve a variety of mechanisms. Among these mechanisms, oxidative stress is one of the main causes of IS injury (30Li P. Stetler R.A. Leak R.K. Shi Y. Li Y. Yu W. et al.Oxidative stress and DNA damage after cerebral ischemia: potential therapeutic targets to repair the genome and improve stroke recovery.Neuropharmacology. 2018; 134: 208-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar, 31Anrather J. Iadecola C. Inflammation and stroke: an overview.Neurotherapeutics. 2016; 13: 661-670Crossref PubMed Scopus (539) Google Scholar). When IS occurs, cells are in a state of ischemia and hypoxia, which leads to the consumption of antioxidants (such as SOD and CAT), disruption of antioxidant balance, destruction of the function and survival of nerve cells, and aggravation of IS (32Andrabi S.S. Parvez S. Tabassum H. Ischemic stroke and mitochondria: Mechanisms and targets.Protoplasma. 2020; 257: 335-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 33Sravanthi K.N. Rao N.R. Cerebroprotective activity of Pentapetes phoenicea on global cerebral ischemia in rats.Indian J. Pharmacol. 2016; 48: 694-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Thus, in the current study, we treated astrocytes with H2O2 to simulate oxidative stress in vitro. We found that the application of OM-LV20 not only promoted TPH1 levels in brain tissue (11Yin S. Yang M. Li Y. Li S. Fu Z. Liu N. et al.Peptide OM-LV20 exerts neuroprotective effects against cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury in rats.Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2021; 537: 36-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar) but also increased the TPH1 level in astrocytes in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 2). In addition, OM-LV20 significantly improved the decrease in cell viability and CAT level induced by H2O2 (Fig. 3). Based on further analysis, the protective effects of OM-LV20 on rat astrocytes under oxidative stress may be through inhibiting the phosphorylation of the JNK signaling pathway and increasing TPH1 and PAC1R levels (Fig. 4). Under H2O2 stimulation, the level of TPH1 in the astrocytes decreased significantly and then increased to a peak at 12 h. The reason for this may be that oxidative stress first consumes intracellular TPH1, after which the cell increases TPH1 due to cell homeostasis imbalance. We also observed that OM-LV20 increased TPH1 levels in the cells after 12 h of treatment. We further explored the function of TPH1 by constructing a stable TPH1-overexpression CTX-TNA2 cell line. Under oxidative stress, the overexpression of TPH1 did not protect cell viability but increased the level of CAT (Fig. 7). Of note, Fig. 2 and 3 demonstrate that while overexpression of TPH1 in astrocytes alone did not ameliorate the H2O2-induced decrease in cell viability, it increased CAT levels. Furthermore, OM-LV20 increased TPH1 levels, improved cell viability reduction, and increased CAT levels. This may be partly attributable to the protective effects of OM-LV20, including activation of the MAPK signaling pathway and increased PAC1R and TPH1 levels (Fig. 4). OM-LV20 also had a greater impact on the increase in CAT under oxidative stress compared to the TPH1 overexpression group (Figs. 3 and 7). Therefore, the protective effects of the peptide, particularly against oxidative stress, may be complex and include more than increasing TPH1 levels. In addition, overexpression of TPH1 may protect cells from harm caused by oxidative stress primarily by increasing CAT levels. Combined with the previous study showing that TPH1 overexpression improves"
https://openalex.org/W4293493507,"The DNA of all living organisms is persistently damaged by endogenous reactions including deamination and oxidation. Such damage, if not repaired correctly, can result in mutations that drive tumor development. In addition to chemical damage, recent studies have established that DNA bases can be enzymatically modified, generating many of the same modified bases. Irrespective of the mechanism of formation, modified bases can alter DNA-protein interactions and therefore modulate epigenetic control of gene transcription. The simultaneous presence of both chemically and enzymatically modified bases in DNA suggests a potential intersection, or collision, between DNA repair and epigenetic reprogramming. In this paper, we have prepared defined sequence oligonucleotides containing the complete set of oxidized and deaminated bases that could arise from 5-methylcytosine. We have probed these substrates with human glycosylases implicated in DNA repair and epigenetic reprogramming. New observations reported here include: SMUG1 excises 5-carboxyuracil (5caU) when paired with A or G. Both TDG and MBD4 cleave 5-formyluracil and 5caU when mispaired with G. Further, TDG not only removes 5-formylcytosine and 5-carboxycytosine when paired with G, but also when mispaired with A. Surprisingly, 5caU is one of the best substrates for human TDG, SMUG1 and MBD4, and a much better substrate than T. The data presented here introduces some unexpected findings that pose new questions on the interactions between endogenous DNA damage, repair, and epigenetic reprogramming pathways."
https://openalex.org/W4293583547,"Candida albicans (C. albicans) is a dimorphic commensal human fungal pathogen that can cause severe oropharyngeal candidiasis (oral thrush) in susceptible hosts. During invasive infection, C. albicans hyphae invade oral epithelial cells (OECs) and secrete candidalysin, a pore-forming cytolytic peptide that is required for C. albicans pathogenesis at mucosal surfaces. Candidalysin is produced in the hyphal invasion pocket and triggers cell damage responses in OECs. Candidalysin also activates multiple MAPK-based signaling events that collectively drive the production of downstream inflammatory mediators that coordinate downstream innate and adaptive immune responses. The activities of candidalysin are dependent on signaling through the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). Here, we interrogated known EGFR-MAPK signaling intermediates for their roles mediating the OEC response to C. albicans infection. Using RNA silencing and pharmacological inhibition, we identified five key adaptors, including growth factor receptor-bound protein 2 (Grb2), Grb2-associated binding protein 1 (Gab1), Src homology and collagen (Shc), SH2-containing protein tyrosine phosphatase-2 (Shp2), and casitas B-lineage lymphoma (c-Cbl). We determined that all of these signaling effectors were inducibly phosphorylated in response to C. albicans. These phosphorylation events occurred in a candidalysin-dependent manner and additionally required EGFR phosphorylation, matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), and cellular calcium flux to activate a complete OEC response to fungal infection. Of these, Gab1, Grb2, and Shp2 were the dominant drivers of ERK1/2 activation and the subsequent production of downstream innate-acting cytokines.

Together, these results identify the key adaptor proteins that drive the EGFR signaling mechanisms that underlie oral epithelial responses to C. albicans. Fungal infections are highly underappreciated contributors of morbidity and mortality in humans, but to date, there are no vaccines to any pathogenic fungi (1Brown G.D. Denning D.W. Gow N.A.R.

Candida species are a dominant cause of both superficial and life-threatening fungal infections in humans, with Candida albicans being the most prevalent. Though normally a benign member of the oral, vaginal, and gut commensal microbiota, disturbances caused by environmental cues or a compromised immune system result in the overgrowth of C. albicans, leading to superficial infections of the mucous membranes, in particularly the oral mucosa, that can significantly lower quality of life and affect millions of individuals annually (2Romani L.

Fungi (Basel). 2017; 3: 60Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). An essential feature of C. albicans pathogenesis is the formation of hyphae, which cause physical damage to the mucosal epithelium, thereby inducing expression and secretion of innate immune factors such as antimicrobial peptides, alarmins, and proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines (4Pellon A. Sadeghi Nasab S.D. Moyes D.L. New insights in Candida albicans innate immunity at the mucosa: toxins, epithelium, metabolism, and beyond.Front. Cell Infect. Microbiol. 2020; 10: 81Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). During infection, C. albicans hyphae secrete candidalysin (Clys) , a cytolytic peptide that is critical for pathogenesis at mucosal surfaces (5Moyes D.L. Wilson D. Richardson J.P. Mogavero S.

Clys is encoded by ECE1, which is highly expressed in hyphae, though not required for filamentation. Clys is generated by processing of its parent protein Ece1p by the kexin proteases (6Liu J.

However, the downstream signals that orchestrate epithelial responses to this fungus are still incompletely understood. EGFR, also known as Her1 or ErbB1, belongs to a family of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) that regulate cell survival, proliferation, apoptosis, differentiation, and development (18Wee P. Wang Z. Epidermal growth factor receptor cell proliferation signaling pathways.Cancers (Basel). 2017; 9: 52Crossref PubMed Scopus (952) Google Scholar). Dysregulation of EGFR is also associated with tumorigenesis (19Sigismund S. Avanzato D. Lanzetti L. Emerging functions of the EGFR in cancer.Mol.

Dysregulation of epidermal growth factor receptor expression in premalignant lesions during head and neck tumorigenesis.Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 3153-3159PubMed Google Scholar). EGFR autophosphorylation is a proximal event that initiates downstream signaling, resulting in recruitment of various adaptors and ultimately activating downstream signaling cascades including MAPK, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt/Protein Kinase B (PI3K/Akt), and signal transducers and activators of transcription (STATs). Multiple microbes are known to exploit EGFR during pathogenesis, using adaptor activation and phosphorylation to infiltrate host cells and evade the immune system (12Ho J. Moyes D.L. Tavassoli M.

Additionally, a role for these adaptors in driving immunity to microbes has also emerged (23Rajaram M.V.S. Arnett E. Azad A.K. Guirado E. Ni B.

In the present study, we sought to elucidate the role of MAPK signaling and EGFR adaptors in the oral epithelial cell (OEC) response to C. albicans. We found that growth factor receptor–bound protein 2 (Grb2), Grb2-associated binding protein 1 (Gab1), Src homology and collagen (Shc), SH2 containing protein tyrosine phosphatase-2 (Shp2, also PTPN11), and casitas B-lineage lymphoma (c-Cbl) are all required to mediate an EGFR-dependent response to C. albicans via Clys. EGFR kinase inhibitors negatively impact this response, which also requires matrix metalloproteinases and cellular calcium flux. Accordingly, we illuminate the underlying mechanisms of how early EGFR-mediated epithelial responses are orchestrated by the novel fungal toxin Clys, with implications for defining the host response to the medically important fungus C. albicans. In establishment of oropharyngeal candidiasis (oral thrush), OECs respond to the pore-forming toxin (PFT) Clys secreted by C. albicans hyphae. OEC responses require EGFR signals, which leads to the release of antifungal proinflammatory mediators that ultimately coordinate an effective host response (4Pellon A. Sadeghi Nasab S.D. Moyes D.L.

However, the underlying mechanisms of the early EGFR molecular events activated in response to C. albicans and Clys remain incompletely characterized. Accordingly, TR146 buccal epithelial cells were infected with a C. albicans (BWP17 + CIp30, parental strain) at a multiplicity of infection of 10 for 2 h, a time point known to be optimal for EGFR activation (13Ho J.

Notably, all proteins known to interact with EGFR were inducibly phosphorylated following infection with C. albicans including Gab1 (Y659), Grb2 (p-Tyrosine), Shc (Y317), Shp2 (Y580), and c-Cbl (Y774) (Fig. 1A). Since filamentation is required for C. albicans–induced epithelial responses (25Moyes D.L. Runglall M. Murciano C. Shen C. Nayar D.

Mutant C. albicans strains lacking the Clys parent gene ECE1 (ece1Δ/Δ) or with a deletion of the region that encodes Clys (ece1Δ/Δ+ECE1Δ184–279) failed to activate Gab1, Shc, Shp2, and c-Cbl (Fig. 1A). However, both mutant strains lacking Clys were able to induce phosphorylation of Grb2, though to a lesser extent than the parental and revertant strains, suggesting Clys is not the sole driver of Grb2 phosphorylation. To determine whether Clys alone could activate this panel of adaptors, TR146 cells were stimulated with Clys over a time course of 2 h. We treated cells with a strongly lytic concentration (70 μM) that triggers membrane damage, calcium flux, and cytokine release, an intermediate sublytic concentration (15 μM) that activates epithelial signal transduction through MAPK, p38/MKP-1, and c-Fos and the production of immune regulatory cytokines, and a non-lytic concentration (3 μM) that induces low level secretion of selected cytokines (Moyes et al., 2016). Phosphorylation of Gab1 at Y659 was detectable within 30 min of exposure to all concentrations of Clys, with phosphorylation levels increased strongly in response to higher concentrations of Clys (70 or 15 μM) at 2 h post treatment (Fig. 1B). Lower concentrations of Clys that do not cause cell lysis (3 μM) also induced pGab1 Y659 at 2 h post treatment. In contrast, treatment with 70 or 15 μM Clys induced Grb2 phosphorylation within 30 min, which was sustained until 2 h. Increased phosphorylation levels were only observed in cells stimulated with 3 μM Clys following 2 h of treatment. Phosphorylation of Shc Y317 was observed within 30 min following treatment with all concentrations of Clys, with a dose-dependent response observed at 30 min and 2 h post stimulation. Together, these data suggest that there is differential temporal organization of adaptors in response to C. albicans and Clys, which appears to be an early, coordinated event. Unexpectedly, the kinetics of Shp2 phosphorylation in response to Clys differed from Gab1, Grb2, and Shc, as phosphorylation of Shp2 Y580 was seen only after 2 h of treatment with 70 or 15 μM Clys, with negligible changes in phosphorylation observed with 3 μM (Fig. 1B). These data suggest either that Shp2 may play a role in the response against Clys when a significant amount of epithelial damage has been induced or slower kinetics of Shp2 activity in comparison to the other adaptors. Treatment of TR146 cells with 70 or 15 μM Clys triggered strong c-Cbl pY774 activation that was sustained at 30 min and 2 h post stimulation (Fig. 1B). Only very modest changes were observed with 3 μM Clys. Collectively, these data show that Clys can induce phosphorylation of adaptors in TR146 epithelial cells in a time- and dose-dependent manner, with distinct activation profiles for adaptors in response to lytic versus sublytic concentrations of Clys. While EGFR and the Ephrin family member, EphA2, play critical roles in mediating the innate epithelial response to Clys and C. albicans (13Ho J. Yang X. Nikou S.A. Kichik N. Donkin A.

To determine whether EGFR drives Clys-induced adaptor activation, we analyzed the effects of the EGFR-specific kinase inhibitors on the activation of Gab1, Grb2, Shc, Shp2, and c-Cbl. Treatment of TR146 cells with EGFR inhibitors gefitinib (used at a final concentration of 1 μM) or PD153035 (0.5 μM) reduced C. albicans–induced phosphorylation of Gab1, Grb2, Shc, Shp2, and c-Cbl at 2 h post infection (Fig. 2A). Similarly, inhibition of EGFR either abolished or reduced phosphorylation of all adaptors in response to Clys (70 or 15 μM), indicating that EGFR activation is indeed required for Clys-induced adaptor activity (Fig. 2B). Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are zinc-dependent metalloendopeptidases that cleave and release EGF family proligands, activating EGFR signaling (13Ho J. Yang X. Nikou S.A. Kichik N. Donkin A. Ponde N.O. et al.Candidalysin activates innate epithelial immune responses via epidermal growth factor receptor.Nat. Commun. 2019; 10: 2297Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Pretreatment of TR146 OECs with the pan-MMP inhibitor Marimastat (10 or 1 μm) suppressed phosphorylation of Gab1, Grb2, Shc, Shp2, and c-Cbl upon Clys stimulation (Fig. 2C) and infection with C. albicans (Fig. S1). Consistent with this, a Clys-deficient C. albicans strain (ece1Δ/Δ+ECE1Δ184–279), failed to phosphorylate Gab1, Shc, and c-Cbl, though induced very modest levels of phosphorylation for Grb2 and Shp2. Additionally, a blocking anti-EGFR mAb (Cetuximab, 10 μg/mL) reduced/abolished the phosphorylation of Gab1, Grb2, Shc, Shp2, and c-Cbl in response to Clys and C. albicans infection (Fig. 3), demonstrating that Clys-induced activation of adaptors is mediated by MMPs, which in turn mediate ligand-induced activation of EGFR. Previously, calcium influx induced by Clys activity was also shown to contribute to EGFR phosphorylation (13Ho J. Yang X. Nikou S.A. Kichik N. Donkin A. Ponde N.O. et al.Candidalysin activates innate epithelial immune responses via epidermal growth factor receptor.Nat. Commun. 2019; 10: 2297Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Accordingly, pretreatment of TR146 cells with the calcium chelator, BAPTA-AM (30 or 10 μM), also suppressed Clys-induced and C. albicans–induced EGFR adaptor activation (Fig. S2). These data show that Clys secreted by C. albicans activates EGFR-related adaptors and downstream signaling programs in OECs via a mechanism that requires calcium influx, MMP activity, and EGFR ligands. Clys permeabilizes target cell membranes, resulting in damage (release of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH)) and the activation of PI3K/Akt/mTOR and MAPK (MKP1/c-Fos) signaling pathways (5Moyes D.L. Wilson D. Richardson J.P. Mogavero S. Tang S.X. Wernecke J. et al.Candidalysin is a fungal peptide toxin critical for mucosal infection.Nature. 2016; 532: 64-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar, 26Moyes D.L. Shen C. Murciano C.

Dis. 2014; 209: 1816-1826Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Notably, Akt/mTOR is important in mediating cell survival and protection against damage (26Moyes D.L. Shen C. Murciano C. Runglall M. Richardson J.P. Arno M. et al.Protection against epithelial damage during Candida albicans infection is mediated by PI3K/Akt and mammalian target of rapamycin signaling.J. Infect. Dis. 2014; 209: 1816-1826Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), and MAPK is required for induction of immune responses (5Moyes D.L. Wilson D. Richardson J.P. Mogavero S. Tang S.X. Wernecke J. et al.Candidalysin is a fungal peptide toxin critical for mucosal infection.Nature. 2016; 532: 64-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar) during epithelial C. albicans infection. Furthermore, Gab1, Grb2, and Shp2 adaptors can mediate the cell survival pathway (27Mattoon D.R. Lamothe B. Lax I. Schlessinger J. The docking protein Gab1 is the primary mediator of EGF-stimulated activation of the PI-3K/Akt cell survival pathway.BMC Biol. 2004; 2: 24Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). To determine whether this panel of EGFR adaptors can modulate these cellular responses, TR146 cells were transfected with siRNAs for Gab1, Grb2, Shc, Shp2, and c-Cbl for 48 h and stimulated with C. albicans or Clys for 2 h. LDH release from TR146 cells was unaffected by knockdown of all adaptors following treatment with C. albicans (Fig. S3A) or Clys (70 or 15 μM) (Fig. S3B). Accordingly, a Clys null strain (ece1Δ/Δ+ECE1Δ184-279) caused no apparent change in epithelial integrity. Assessment of the Akt/mTOR pathway similarly showed no change in phosphorylation upon adaptor knockdown (Fig. S3C). Thus, these EGFR adaptors do not appear to be required to protect epithelial cells from damage or for cell survival in response to C. albicans infection and Clys. In contrast, siRNA knockdown of Gab1 and Grb2 had a marked impact on c-Fos protein levels and suppressed phosphorylation of MKP1/DUSP1 in response to C. albicans and Clys (Fig. 4, A and B). Knockdown of Shc had only a minor impact on c-Fos and MKP1/DUSP1 activation, and the effects of Shp2 or c-Cbl knockdown via siRNA were negligible. To better understand how Gab1 and Grb2 activate c-Fos and MKP1/DUSP1, we next assessed the three major branches of the MAPK signaling cascade, ERK1/2, p38 and SAPK/JNK. In response to C. albicans, knockdown of Gab1 and Grb2 had a marked effect on ERK1/2 phosphorylation but not p38 or SAPK/JNK (Fig. 4, A and B). While Grb2 knockdown also showed a decrease in pERK1/2 in response to Clys, Gab1 knockdown showed a modest increase in ERK1/2, p38, and SAPK/JNK phosphorylation. As expected, a Clys-null strain (ece1Δ/Δ+ECE1Δ184-279) did not trigger MAPK phosphorylation. Thus, Gab1 and Grb2 are required for MAPK activation during C. albicans infection, but the Gab1 activation pattern differs when responding to exogenously-applied synthetic Clys. Impairing Shp2 via siRNA had no detectable effect on C. albicans and Clys-induced signals; however, a caveat is that Shp2 knockdown was inefficient (60%, Fig. S4). Therefore, we also addressed this question by treating TR146 cells with SHP099 HCL, an allosteric inhibitor that selectively and potently targets Shp2. Cells were pretreated with SHP099 HCL (10 or 5 μM) for 1 h and then assessed for cell damage, MAPK and Akt/mTOR pathway activation after infection. Similar to observations with Shp2 siRNA, LDH release and mTOR phosphorylation from TR146 OECs was unaffected by Shp2 inhibition (Fig. S5). However, treatment with SHP099 HCL suppressed C. albicans–induced and Clys-induced levels of c-Fos, pMKP1/DUSP1, and pERK1/2, though not pSAPK/JNK or pp38 (Fig. 5, A and B). Thus, in addition to a key role for Gab1 and Grb2 adaptors, Shp2 also contributes to ERK1/2 activation in response to C. albicans and Clys. A characteristic endpoint of Clys activity and EGFR activation is the production of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines. Using siRNA knockdown, we evaluated the role of this panel of EGFR adaptors in driving the production of G-CSF, GM-CSF, IL-6, IL-1α, and IL-1β from TR146 cells 24 h after C. albicans or Clys treatment. Knockdown of Gab1, Grb2, or Shc reduced secretion of GM-CSF, G-CSF, and IL-1α in response to C. albicans (Figs. 6, A, B and S6A) and Clys (Fig. S6, B, C, and E). Notably, only Gab1 or Grb2 knockdown reduced release of IL-1β and IL-6 in response to C. albicans (Fig. 6, C and D), suggesting that distinct pathways dictate adaptor-mediated cytokine responses during fungal signaling on OECs. Interestingly, knockdown of c-Cbl appeared to increase the release of G-CSF in response to C. albicans and GM-CSF and IL-6 in response to Clys (Figs. 6A, S6, C and D), possibly suggesting a negative regulatory role for c-Cbl in immune signaling. The Shp2 inhibitor, SHP099 HCL, impaired G-CSF, GM-CSF, IL-1α, and IL-β secretion in response to C. albicans treatment (Figs. 6E, S7, A, C, and D). Similarly, Shp2 inhibition significantly reduced G-CSF, GM-CSF, and IL-β release in response to Clys (Fig. S7, E, F, and H). Interestingly, Shp2 inhibition resulted in a significant increase in IL-6 release in response to Clys (Fig. 6F). OECs respond to Clys-induced tissue injury in part by inducing damage-associated immune responses, including release of alarmins and antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) such as β-defensins (17Ho J. Wickramasinghe D.N. Nikou S.-A. Hube B. Richardson J.P. Naglik J.R. Candidalysin is a potent trigger of alarmin and antimicrobial peptide release in epithelial cells.Cells. 2020; 9: 699Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). To investigate the role of these adaptors in AMP induction, we incubated TR146 cells with Clys following siRNA knockdown of adaptors or inhibition of Shp2 and evaluated DEFB4A mRNA (encoding BD2). Adaptor knockdown or inhibition had no significant effect on gene expression in response to Clys (Fig. S8, A and B). As Clys does not stimulate S100 protein release (17Ho J. Wickramasinghe D.N. Nikou S.-A. Hube B. Richardson J.P. Naglik J.R. Candidalysin is a potent trigger of alarmin and antimicrobial peptide release in epithelial cells.Cells. 2020; 9: 699Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), their expression was not assessed. Overall, these data indicate that Gab1, Grb2, Shc, and Shp2 adaptors but not c-Cbl play pivotal roles in mediating cytokine but not alarmin innate responses to fungal infection. The oral epithelium coordinates the early antifungal response to infection through the release of cytokines, chemokines, and other inflammatory mediators that recruit leukocytes, infiltrating neutrophils, and inflammatory monocytes to combat infection. Interactions between epithelial cells and C. albicans are critical for host defense mechanisms to mucosal infection. The discovery of the C. albicans–derived PFT, Clys, was a paradigm shift in understanding how hyphae promote pathogenesis, simultaneously causing target cell damage but also activating innate immune responses that are essential to limit control of this commensal microbe. This discovery led to a myriad of studies revealing how Clys activity interfaces with the host immune system and balances commensalism with pathogenicity (6Liu J. Willems H.M.E. Sansevere E.A.

https://openalex.org/W4293579560,"Critical thinking is the process by which people make decisions about what to trust and what to do. Many undergraduate courses, such as those in biology and physics, include critical thinking as an important learning goal. Assessing critical thinking, however, is non-trivial, with mixed recommendations for how to assess critical thinking as part of instruction. Here we evaluate the efficacy of assessment questions to probe students' critical thinking skills in the context of biology and physics. We use two research-based standardized critical thinking instruments known as the Biology Lab Inventory of Critical Thinking in Ecology (Eco-BLIC) and Physics Lab Inventory of Critical Thinking (PLIC). These instruments provide experimental scenarios and pose questions asking students to evaluate what to trust and what to do regarding the quality of experimental designs and data. Using more than 3000 student responses from over 20 institutions, we sought to understand what features of the assessment questions elicit student critical thinking. Specifically, we investigated (a) how students critically evaluate aspects of research studies in biology and physics when they are individually evaluating one study at a time versus comparing and contrasting two and (b) whether individual evaluation questions are needed to encourage students to engage in critical thinking when comparing and contrasting. We found that students are more critical when making comparisons between two studies than when evaluating each study individually. Also, compare-and-contrast questions are sufficient for eliciting critical thinking, with students providing similar answers regardless of if the individual evaluation questions are included. This research offers new insight on the types of assessment questions that elicit critical thinking at the introductory undergraduate level; specifically, we recommend instructors incorporate more compare-and-contrast questions related to experimental design in their courses and assessments."

We followed 33 Japanese patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 in April 2020 for 12 months (12M). Patients were tested for NAbs and for antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid (anti-NC-Ab) and antibodies against the spike receptor-binding domain (anti-RBD-Ab). Tests were performed at 2M, 6M, and 12M after the primary infection (api) with commercially available test kits. In 90.9% (30/33) of patients, NAbs persisted for 12M api, though the median titers significantly declined from 78.7% (interquartile range [IQR]: 73.0-85.0%) at 2M, to 59.8% (IQR: 51.2-77.9) at 6M (P = 0.008), and to 56.2% (IQR: 39.6-74.4) at 12M (P<0.001). An exponential decay model showed that the NAb level reached undetectable concentrations at 35.5 months api (95% confidence interval: 26.5-48.0 months). Additionally, NAb titers were significantly related to anti-RBD-Ab titers (rho = 0.736, P<0.001), but not to anti-NC-Ab titers. In most patients convalescing from COVID-19, NAbs persisted for 12M api. This result suggested that patients need a booster vaccination within one year api, even though NAbs could be detected for over two years api. Anti-RBD-Ab titers could be used as a surrogate marker for predicting residual NAb levels."

Even with the sharp growth of studies on this theme over the last decades, we are still trying to convince our peers that diversity matters and, if embraced, makes better science. Part of this drawback can be related to the need for data to support effective proposals to change the academic scenario. In order to close some of those gaps, we here analyze 1) the profile of Brazilian researchers based on production, impact, and membership to the Brazilian Academy of Sciences, 2) participation in the Editorial boards of Brazilian journals dedicated to Entomology, and, 3) the academic scenario of Brazilian Entomology focusing on the sex of the first and last authors in peer-reviewed international publications related to Entomology. We aimed to provide a deeper look on the Brazilian Entomology scenario and to expand the amount of data availability to stimulate and foster a mind-change in the current academic structure. We performed scientometric searches and analysis using different platforms and found that the number and impact of the publications by female researchers, as observed by relative numbers, are not less than that of males. Despite that, female researchers are less represented at the Brazilian Academy of Sciences and editorial boards, reinforcing the lack of women recognition in science. Thus, we observe that some narratives related to the productivity gap can be misleading to a perpetuation of our internal and structural biases. We here expanded data from a previous paper where we scrutinized the Brazilian Entomology scenario and discussed the patches and systems that maintain gender gap in science."

The daily fecal volume from transanal drainage tube was measured on postoperative day 1-5, and the defecation during transanal drainage tube placement was investigated.Anastomotic leakage during transanal drainage tube placement occurred in 4 patients. The anastomotic leakage rate during transanal drainage tube placement in patients whose maximum daily fecal volume or total fecal volume from the transanal drainage tube during postoperative days 1-5 was large was significantly higher than that in patients whose fecal volume was small. The anastomotic leakage rate of the patients with intentional defecation during transanal drainage tube placement was significantly higher than that of the patients without intentional defecation during transanal drainage tube placement. The maximum daily fecal volume and the total fecal volume from the transanal drainage tube during postoperative days 1-5 in patients who experienced intentional defecation during transanal drainage tube placement was significantly higher than that of patients without intentional defecation during transanal drainage tube placement.A large fecal volume from transanal drainage tube after anterior rectal resection or intentional defecation in patients with transanal drainage tube placement were suggested to be risk factors for anastomotic leakage."
https://openalex.org/W4293469443,"Philaenus spumarius is a cosmopolitan species that has become a major threat to European agriculture being recognized as the main vector of the introduced plant pathogen Xylella fastidiosa, the agent of the ""olive quick decline syndrome"", a disease which is devastating olive orchards in southern Italy. Wolbachia are bacterial symbionts of many insects, frequently as reproductive parasites, sometime by establishing mutualistic relationships, able to spread within host populations. Philaenus spumarius harbors Wolbachia, but the role played by this symbiont is unknown and data on the infection prevalence within host populations are limited. Here, the Wolbachia infection rate was analyzed in relation to the geographic distribution and the genetic diversity of the Italian populations of P. spumarius. Analysis of the COI gene sequences revealed a geographically structured distribution of the three main mitochondrial lineages of P. spumarius. Wolbachia was detected in half of the populations sampled in northern Italy where most individuals belonged to the western-Mediterranean lineage. All populations sampled in southern and central Italy, where the individuals of the eastern-Mediterranean lineage were largely prevalent, were uninfected. Individuals of the north-eastern lineage were found only in populations from the Alps in the northernmost part of Italy, at high altitudes. In this area, Wolbachia infection reached the highest prevalence, with no difference between north-eastern and western-Mediterranean lineage. Analysis of molecular diversity of COI sequences suggested no significant effect of Wolbachia on population genetics of P. spumarius. Using the MLST approach, six new Wolbachia sequence types were identified. Using FISH, Wolbachia were observed within the host's reproductive tissues and salivary glands. Results obtained led us to discuss the role of Wolbachia in P. spumarius, the factors influencing the geographic distribution of the infection, and the exploitation of Wolbachia for the control of the vector insect to reduce the spread of X. fastidiosa."

This study’s goal was to demonstrate that using personalized interventions can significantly increase patient adherence. Method Ninety-five patients (ages 18–90) eligible for the CR program were randomly recruited and received personalized interventions using the Well-Beat system. Adherence levels were compared to those of a historical control group. The Well-Beat system provided Sheba CR Health Care Provider (HCP) guidelines for personalized patient-therapist dialogue. The system also generated ongoing personalized text messages for each patient sent twice a week and related each patient’s dynamic profile to their daily behavior, creating continuity, and reinforcing the desired behavior. Results A significant increase in patient adherence to the CR program: Three months after initiation, 76% remained active compared to the historical average of 24% in the matched control group (log-rank p-value = 0.001). Conclusions Using an Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based engine that generated recommendations and messages made it possible to improve patient adherence without increasing HCP load, benefiting all. Presenting customized patient insights to the HCP and generating personalized communications along with action motivating text messages can also be useful for remote care."

https://openalex.org/W4293579411,"Background The role of interferon gamma (IFN-γ) expression in long-term survival has not been studied in patients with urinary bladder cancer (UBC). IFN-γ expression was characterized among various UBC patient cohorts to assess if IFN-γ status is associated with overall survival (OS). Methods A tumor-based IFN-γ gene signature was evaluated among adult UBC patients newly diagnosed between 2004 and 2017 from two hospital systems in New York. Patient cohorts included metastatic (stage IV or progressing to stage IV [MBC]), muscle-invasive (stages T2a to T4a [MIBC]), and non–muscle-invasive (carcinoma in situ or stages 0a, 0is, and I [NMIBC]) disease. Descriptive analyses were conducted comparing IFN-γ signature in the highest tertile to those in the lowest two tertiles. Results 234 patients with bladder cancer were evaluated (56 MBC, 38 MIBC, and 140 NMIBC). Median OS was only reached in the MIBC cohort for those with an IFN-γ signature in the lowest two tertiles (15.03 months [95% CI, 8.50–50.60]). Those with an IFN-γ signature in the highest tertile had a decreased risk of mortality in all cohorts indicating better survival, but this was statistically significant in only the MIBC cohort (adjusted HR = 0.09 [95% CI, 0.01–0.73]). Conclusion IFN-γ signature status was associated with a decreased mortality risk in all cohorts, particularly MIBC, indicating that it may be a prognostic marker of survival in patients with UBC."

If numerous stocks are present, management at the wrong spatial scales could cause the loss of minor yellowfin tuna populations in the EPO. In this study we used double digestion RADseq to assess the genetic structure of yellowfin tuna in the EPO. A total of 164 yellowfin tuna from Cabo San Lucas, México, and the Galápagos Islands and Santa Elena, Ecuador, were analysed using 18,011 single nucleotide polymorphisms. Limited genetic differentiation (F ST = 0.00058–0.00328) observed among the sampling locations (México, Ecuador, Peru, and within Ecuador) is consistent with presence of a single yellowfin tuna population within the EPO. Our findings are consistent with the IATTC assessment and provide further evidence of the need for transboundary cooperation for the successful management of this important fishery throughout the EPO."

Human UFSP1 translated from an upstream near-cognate initiation codon functions as an active UFM1-specific proteaseJournal of Biological ChemistryVol. 298Issue 6PreviewUbiquitin-fold modifier 1 (UFM1) is a recently identified ubiquitin-like posttranslational modification with important biological functions. However, the regulatory mechanisms governing UFM1 modification of target proteins (UFMylation) and the cellular processes controlled by UFMylation remain largely unknown. It has been previously shown that a UFM1-specific protease (UFSP2) mediates the maturation of the UFM1 precursor and drives the de-UFMylation reaction. Furthermore, it has long been thought that UFSP1, an ortholog of UFSP2, is inactive in many organisms, including human, because it lacks an apparent protease domain when translated from the canonical start codon (445AUG).

Like many other ubiquitin family proteins, Ufm1 is translated as a precursor, the C-terminal dipeptide of which must be cleaved to yield mature Ufm1, which is subsequently activated by the Ufm1-activating enzyme Uba5 to initiate UFMylation (1Komatsu M.

Like protein ubiquitination, neddylation, or SUMOylation, protein UFMylation is also a reversible process (2Gerakis Y. Quintero M. Li H. Hetz C.

Chem. 2007; 282: 5256-5262Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Both Ufm1 maturation and de-UFMylation are mediated by Ufm1-specific proteases or UFSPs (5Kang S.H. Kim G.R. Seong M. Baek S.H. Seol J.H. Bang O.S. et al.Two novel ubiquitin-fold modifier 1 (Ufm1)-specific proteases, UfSP1 and UfSP2.J. Biol.

Chem. 2007; 282: 5256-5262Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar); however, it is widely accepted that UFSP2 is the only active Ufm1 protease that performs these processes in human cells; in contrast, human UFSP1 is considered as an inactive protease, since it only has partial sequences of the protease domain, whereas in other species UFSP1 does contain the whole protease sequence. Yet, the unique evolution of human UFSP1 has long remained a mystery. A recent discovery by Liang et al. (6Liang Q. Jin Y. Xu S. Zhou J. Mao J. Ma X. et al.Human UFSP1 translated from an upstream near-cognate initiation codon functions as an active UFM1-specific protease.J. Biol. Chem. 2022; 298102016Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (7) Google Scholar) showed some rather surprising results. Initially, they noticed that UFMylation was enhanced when UFSP2 was knocked out in human cells, suggesting that there is an additional protease involved in the maturation of the Ufm1 precursor. Then, they immediately turned to UFSP1. They first expressed the full-length complementary DNA (cDNA) of UFSP1, including its 5′-UTR, and found that it could de-UFMylate Ufm1 conjugates in 293T and HeLa cells. This cDNA produced a ∼23 kDa protein, instead of the ∼17 kDa protein, predicted based on the canonical open reading frame (ORF) that showed no de-UFMylation activity when transfected in cells. Using a reverse genetic approach, the authors also noticed that UFMylation was slightly enhanced in UFSP1 KO cells but strongly increased in UFSP2 KO cells, suggesting that UFSP2 could be a major protease involved in de-UFMylation of substrates. When both proteases were knocked out, no UFMylation was detectable. These results strongly indicated that UFSP1 employs a noncanonical ORF to produce a Ufm1 protease mainly responsible for the maturation of the Ufm1 precursor. Evidently, the canonical ORF only contains part of the coding region of the full-length UFSP1. The authors concluded that human cells produce an active UFSP1 from a nontraditional start codon instead of at a classic AUG codon and that its main function is to make mature Ufm1. Besides the cognate AUG start codon, eukaryotic cells also employ other near-cognate start codons to initiate translation (7Kearse M.G. Wilusz J.E. Non-AUG translation: a new start for protein synthesis in eukaryotes.Genes Dev. 2017; 31: 1717-1731Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar, 8Cao X. Slavoff S.A. Non-AUG start codons: expanding and regulating the small and alternative ORFeome.Exp. Cell Res. 2020; 391111973Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). For example, the oncogene c-myc uses both near-cognate CUG and cognate AUG as translational initiation codons to synthesize c-myc1 and c-myc2 oncoproteins, respectively (9Hann S.R. King M.W. Bentley D.L. Anderson C.W. Eisenman R.N. A non-AUG translational initiation in c-myc exon 1 generates an N-terminally distinct protein whose synthesis is disrupted in Burkitt’s lymphomas.Cell. 1988; 52: 185-195Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). In fact, the most frequent near-cognate start codon is CUG. Because the full-length cDNA produces a ∼23 kDa protein, Liang et al. selected four candidate CUG codons based on predicted molecular weights of polypeptides and their abilities to synthesize active UFSP1 enzymes. Using serial mutagenesis-based approaches, the authors found that 217CUG is the only potential start codon. To provide even more evidence, they turned to mass spectrometry. The authors engineered a FLAG-tag at the carboxyl terminus of UFSP1 using a CRISPR/Cas9-based knock-in method and then purified the UFSP1-FLAG fusion proteins from engineered cells. Six peptides covering more than 90% of the predicted N-terminal peptide sequences from 217CUG to the canonical 445AUG codons were identified using this method. In addition, using in vitro assays with purified recombinant proteins, the authors further consolidated UFSP1 as a protease in the maturation of Ufm1 precursor and de-UFMylation. Even more surprisingly, they provided some evidence suggesting UFSP1 as an even stronger enzyme for both Ufm1 maturation and de-UFMylation of Ufm1-conjugated ASC1 compared to UFSP2. CUG is the most common near-cognate start codon employed in eukaryotes, but the mechanism behind its use is still unclear. The authors of this study discovered that the 5′-UTR sequence is essential for UFSP1 expression in humans; in particular, they identified an E-box motif, CAGCTG, which plays an important role in human UFSP1 expression. Furthermore, they confirmed the critical role of the eukaryotic translation initiation factor eIF2A in translation of UFSP1 from the CUG codon using both chemical and RNAi approaches. Ultimately, Liang et al. (6Liang Q. Jin Y. Xu S. Zhou J. Mao J. Ma X. et al.Human UFSP1 translated from an upstream near-cognate initiation codon functions as an active UFM1-specific protease.J. Biol. Chem. 2022; 298102016Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (7) Google Scholar) provided strong evidence that UFSP1 is an active Ufm1 protease in human cells and that its translation is initiated at a near-cognate CUG start codon. Moreover, they identified an E-box sequence at the 5′-UTR and eIF2A as critical factors in human UFSP1 expression. However, there are still some unanswered questions that remain. For example, are there any RNA-binding proteins that can specifically recognize the E-box sequence to assist the CUG start codon usage? If so, how can these proteins coordinate with eIF2A to initiate UFSP1 translation at the near-cognate start codon? Also, the authors claim that the enzymatic activities of UFSP1 are higher than that of UFSP2 in in vitro assays, although it appears that UFSP2 is better at de-UFMylation in cells. The question is, does the recombinant UFSP2 protein lose some activity during the purification process? Would the HA-tag sequence, if fused at the carboxyl terminus of UFSP2, lead to stronger cellular activity when expressed in cells, since the localization of UFSP2 to the endoplasmic reticulum membrane is potentially critical for its maximal activity? Furthermore, the authors only used ASC1 as a substrate in their assay, but these two proteases might behave differently toward other Ufm1 substrates. It is worth mentioning that a similar study by Millrine et al. (10Millrine D. Cummings T. Matthews S.P. Peter J.J. Magnussen H.M. Lange S.M. et al.Human UFSP1 is an active protease that regulates UFM1 maturation and UFMylation.Cell Rep. 2022; 40111168Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar) answered part of this question. Finally, does the E-box sequence discovered here exist in the 5′-UTR of other genes which employ near-cognate start codons as translation start sites? Nevertheless, the discovery of an active UFSP1 opens a new avenue to study biological functions of UFMylation in humans. The identification of the E-box sequence could also provide clues to the mechanisms behind near-cognate translation initiation. If so, this discovery could have a much broader impact beyond studies of UFMylation. The authors declare that they have no conflicts of interest with the contents of this article.

The contribution of S . aureus genomic variability to pathogenesis of these infections is poorly described. Methods We prospectively enrolled 47 children over 3 1/2 years from whom S . aureus was isolated on culture—12 uninfected with skin colonization, 16 with skin abscesses, 19 with osteoarticular infections (four with septic arthritis, three with acute osteomyelitis, six with acute osteomyelitis and septic arthritis and six with chronic osteomyelitis). Isolates underwent whole genome sequencing, with assessment for 254 virulence genes and any mutations as well as creation of a phylogenetic tree. Finally, isolates were compared for their ability to form static biofilms and compared to the genetic analysis. Results No sequence types predominated amongst osteoarticular infections. Only genes involved in evasion of host immune defenses were more frequently carried by isolates from osteoarticular infections than from skin colonization (p = .02). Virulence gene mutations were only noted in 14 genes (three regulating biofilm formation) when comparing isolates from subjects with osteoarticular infections and those with skin colonization. Biofilm results demonstrated large heterogeneity in the isolates’ capacity to form static biofilms, with healthy control isolates producing more robust biofilm formation. Conclusions S . aureus causing osteoarticular infections are genetically heterogeneous, and more frequently harbor genes involved in immune evasion than less invasive isolates. However, virulence gene carriage overall is similar with infrequent mutations, suggesting that pathogenesis of S . aureus osteoarticular infections may be primarily regulated at transcriptional and/or translational levels."

Therefore, this study was conducted to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of hypertension treatment based on 2020 International Society of Hypertension (ISH) guidelines from a societal perspective. Methods We developed a state-transition Markov model based on the cardiovascular disease policy model adapted to the Sub-Saharan African perspective to simulate costs of treated and untreated hypertension and disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) averted by treating previously untreated adults above 30 years from a societal perspective for a lifetime. Results The full implementation of the ISH 2020 hypertension guidelines can prevent approximately 22,348.66 total productive life-year losses annually. The incremental net monetary benefit of treating hypertension based was $128,520,077.61 US by considering a willingness-to-pay threshold of $50,000 US per DALY averted. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of treating hypertension when compared with null was $1,125.44 US per DALY averted. Treating hypertension among adults aged 40–64 years was very cost-effective 625.27 USD per DALY averted. Treating hypertensive adults aged 40–64 years with diabetes and CKD is very cost-effective in both women and men (i.e., 559.48 USD and 905.40 USD/DALY averted respectively). Conclusion The implementation of the ISH 2020 guidelines among hypertensive adults in Southern Ethiopia could result in $9,574,118.47 US economic savings. Controlling hypertension in all patients with or with diabetes and or CKD could be effective and cost-saving. Therefore, improving treatment coverage, blood pressure control rate, and adherence to treatment by involving all relevant stakeholders is critical to saving scarce health resources."
https://openalex.org/W4293469612,"Type 2 diabetes (T2D) has earned widespread recognition as a primary cause of death, disability, and increasing healthcare costs. There is compelling evidence that hereditary factors contribute to the development of T2D. Clinical trials in T2D have mostly focused on genes and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in protein-coding areas. Recently, it was revealed that SNPs located in noncoding areas also play a significant impact on disease vulnerability. It is required for cell type-specific gene expression. However, the precise mechanism by which T2D risk genes and SNPs work remains unknown. We integrated risk genes and SNPs from genome-wide association studies (GWASs) and performed comprehensive bioinformatics analyses to further investigate the functional significance of these genes and SNPs. We identified four intriguing transcription factors (TFs) associated with T2D. The analysis revealed that the SNPs are engaged in chromatin interaction regulation and/or may have an effect on TF binding affinity. The Gene Ontology (GO) study revealed high enrichment in a number of well-characterized signaling pathways and regulatory processes, including the STAT3 and JAK signaling pathways, which are both involved in T2D metabolism. Additionally, a detailed KEGG pathway analysis identified two major T2D genes and their prospective therapeutic targets. Our findings underscored the potential functional significance of T2D risk genes and SNPs, which may provide unique insights into the disease’s pathophysiology."

Visual symbolic to verbal transcoding and vice versa strongly relies on language proficiency. We evaluated transcoding of German-French bilinguals from Luxembourg in 5 th , 8 th , 11 th graders and adults. In the Luxembourgish educational system, children acquire mathematics in German (LM1) until the 7 th grade, and then the language of learning mathematic switches to French (LM2). French `70s `80s `90s are less transparent than `30s `40s `50s numbers, since they have a base-20 structure, which is not the case in German. Transcoding was evaluated with a reading aloud and a verbal-visual number matching task. Results of both tasks show a cognitive cost for transcoding numbers having a base-20 structure ( i . e . `70s, `80s and `90s), such that response times were slower in all age groups. Furthermore, considering only base-10 numbers ( i . e . `30s `40s `50s), it appeared that transcoding in LM2 (French) also entailed a cost. While participants across age groups tended to read numbers slower in LM2, this effect was limited to the youngest age group in the matching task. In addition, participants made more errors when reading LM2 numbers. In conclusion, we observed an age-independent language effect with numbers having a base-20 structure in French, reflecting their reduced transparency with respect to the decimal system. Moreover, we find an effect of language of math acquisition such that transcoding is less well mastered in LM2. This effect tended to persist until adulthood in the reading aloud task, while in the matching task performance both languages become similar in older adolescents and young adults. This study supports the link between numbers and language, especially highlighting the impact of language on reading numbers aloud from childhood to adulthood."

This raises the question of whether and how the amino acid type at position 129 influences the structural properties of huPrP, affecting its folding, stability, and amyloid formation behavior. Here, our detailed biophysical characterization of the 129M and 129V variants of recombinant full-length huPrP(23-230) by amyloid formation kinetics, CD spectroscopy, molecular dynamics simulations, and sedimentation velocity analysis reveals differences in their aggregation propensity and oligomer content, leading to deviating pathways for the conversion into amyloid at acidic pH. We determined that the 129M variant exhibits less secondary structure content before amyloid formation and higher resistance to thermal denaturation compared to the 129V variant, whereas the amyloid conformation of both variants shows similar thermal stability. Additionally, our molecular dynamics simulations and rigidity analyses at the atomistic level identify intramolecular interactions responsible for the enhanced monomer stability of the 129M variant, involving more frequent minimum distances between E196 and R156, forming a salt bridge. Removal of the N-terminal half of the 129M full-length variant diminishes its differences compared to the 129V full-length variant and highlights the relevance of the flexible N terminus in huPrP. Taken together, our findings provide insight into structural properties of huPrP and the effects of the amino acid identity at position 129 on amyloid formation behavior."

The green semilooper ( Chrysodeixis acuta Walker), a widespread tomato and soybean pest, has lately been described as an emergent onion crop pest in India. C . acuta whole mitochondrial genome was sequenced in this work. The circular genome of C . acuta measured 15,743 base pairs (bp) in length. Thirteen protein-coding genes (PCGs), 22 tRNA genes, two rRNA genes, and one control region were found in the 37 sequence elements. With an average 395 bp gene length, the maximum and minimum gene length observed was 1749 bp and 63 bp of nad5 and trnR , respectively. Nine of the thirteen PCGs have (ATN) as a stop codon, while the other four have a single (T) as a stop codon. Except for trnS1 , all of the tRNAs were capable of producing a conventional clover leaf structure. Conserved ATAGA motif sequences and poly-T stretch were identified at the start of the control region. Six overlapping areas and 18 intergenic spacer regions were found, with sizes ranged from 1 to 20 bp and 1 to 111 bp correspondingly. Phylogenetically, C . acuta belongs to the Plusiinae subfamily of the Noctuidae superfamily, and is closely linked to Trichoplusia ni species from the same subfamily.

https://openalex.org/W4293579592,"Although paramutation has been well-studied at a few hallmark loci involved in anthocyanin biosynthesis in maize, the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying the phenomenon remain largely unknown. Previously described actors of paramutation encode components of the RNA-directed DNA-methylation (RdDM) pathway that participate in the biogenesis of 24-nucleotide small interfering RNAs (24-nt siRNAs) and long non-coding RNAs. In this study, we uncover an ARGONAUTE (AGO) protein as an effector of the RdDM pathway that is in charge of guiding 24-nt siRNAs to their DNA target to create de novo DNA methylation. We combined immunoprecipitation, small RNA sequencing and reverse genetics to, first, validate AGO104 as a member of the RdDM effector complex and, then, investigate its role in paramutation. We found that AGO104 binds 24-nt siRNAs involved in RdDM, including those required for paramutation at the b1 locus. We also show that the ago104-5 mutation causes a partial reversion of the paramutation phenotype at the b1 locus, revealed by intermediate pigmentation levels in stem tissues. Therefore, our results place AGO104 as a new member of the RdDM effector complex that plays a role in paramutation at the b1 locus in maize."

Endothelial progenitor cell capture stents with surface-immobilized antibodies show significantly improved endothelialization in the clinic. However, most current antibody-based stent surface modification strategies rely on antibody adsorption or direct conjugation via amino or carboxyl groups which leads to poor control over antibody surface concentration and/or molecular orientation, and ultimately bioavailability for cell capture. Here, we assess the utility of a bioaffinity-based surface modification strategy to immobilize antibodies targeting endothelial cell surface antigens. A cysteine-tagged truncated protein G polypeptide containing three Fc-binding domains was conjugated onto aminated polystyrene substrates via a bi-functional linking arm, followed by antibody immobilization. Different IgG antibodies were successfully immobilized on the protein G-modified surfaces. Covalent grafting of the protein G polypeptide was more effective than surface adsorption in immobilizing antibodies at high density based on fluorophore-labeled secondary antibody detection, as well as endothelial colony-forming cell capture through anti-CD144 antibodies. This work presents a potential avenue for enhancing the performance of cell capture strategies by using covalent grafting of protein G polypeptides to immobilize IgG antibodies."

The role of IOL axial movement on short-term refractive shift after cataract surgery was also evaluated.This retrospective comparative study enrolled consecutive patients who had phacoemulsification with aspheric IOL implantation. The IOL depth (the distance from corneal endothelium to IOL surface) and corneal power were measured via anterior-segment optical coherence tomography at 4 days and 1 month postoperatively. The changes in axial movement of the IOL, corneal power, and manifest refractive spherical equivalent (MRSE) were compared among groups, and the correlations between each lens were evaluated.IOL with hinges was implanted in 42 eyes of 42 patients and IOL without hinges was implanted in 42 eyes of 42 patients. The change in axial movement between 4 days and 1 month was significantly smaller in the IOL with hinges group than in the IOL without hinges group (p < 0.001). The axial movement of IOL with hinges did not correlate with the MRSE change; however, the forward shift of IOL without hinges correlated with the myopic refractive change (Pearson r = 0.62, p < 0.001).The postoperative axial movement of IOL was more stable in the IOL with hinges group than the IOL without hinges group between 4 days and 1 month after cataract surgery. Even though the two study IOLs with planar-haptic design are made of similar acrylic materials, other characteristics such as hinge structure may affect IOL stability in the bag."

In this study, we present a supervised DOS nonlinear regression prediction model whose accuracy outperforms earlier results. In addition, unlike previous studies, we identify the features that influence DOS prediction. Further, in difference from others, we study the causal relationship between the feature set and DOS. The feature sets used in prior studies included a subset of the features presented in this study. This study aimed to derive influential effectors of duration of surgery via optimized prediction and causality analysis. We implemented an array of machine learning algorithms and trained them on datasets comprising surgery-related data, to derive DOS prediction models. The datasets we acquired contain patient, surgical staff, and surgery features. The datasets comprised 23,293 surgery records of eight surgery types performed over a 10-year period in a public hospital. We have introduced new, unstudied features and combined them with features adopted from previous studies to generate a comprehensive feature set. We utilized feature importance methods to identify the influential features, and causal inference methods to identify the causal features. Our model demonstrates superior performance in comparison to DOS prediction models in the art. The performance of our DOS model in terms of the mean absolute error (MAE) was 14.9 minutes. The algorithm that derived the model with the best performance was the gradient boosted trees (GBT). We identified the 10 most influential features and the 10 most causal features. In addition, we showed that 40% of the influential features have a significant (p-value = 0.05) causal relationship with DOS. We developed a DOS prediction model whose accuracy is higher than that of prior models. This improvement is achieved via the introduction of a novel feature set on which the model was trained. Utilizing our prediction model, hospitals can improve the efficiency of surgery schedules, and by exploiting the identified causal relationship, can influence the DOS.

The flow fields selected were transitional Poiseuille-Couette flow situations found in ventricular assist devices and turbulent flows at conditions found in blood pumps. The passive particle properties were selected to represent molecules of the von Willebrand factor (vWF) protein. Damage to the vWF molecule can cause disease, most often related to hemostasis. The hydrodynamic shear stresses along the trajectories of the particles were calculated and the changes in the distribution of stresses were determined for proteins released in different locations in the flow field and as a function of exposure time. The stress distributions indicated that even when the average applied stress was within a safe operating regime, the proteins spent part of their trajectories in flow areas of damaging stress. Further examination showed that the history of the distribution of stresses applied on the vWF molecules, rather than the average, should be used to evaluate hydrodynamically-induced damage."
https://openalex.org/W4293469422,"Multidrug sensitivity is an autosomal recessive disorder in dogs caused by a 4-bp deletion in the ABCB1 gene, often referred to as the ABCB1-1Δ variant. This disease has a high prevalence in some breeds and causes adverse reactions to certain drugs when given in normal doses. Though most dogs known to be at risk are of the collie lineage or were traced back to it, the variant has also been described in several seemingly unrelated breeds. It is generally advised to genotype dogs at risk before treating them. However, there seems to be a discrepancy between the advice and current veterinary practices, as a recent study in Belgium and the Netherlands showed that most veterinarians never order a DNA test. To assess the possible risk of not testing for multidrug sensitivity in a clinical setting, the ABCB1-1Δ variant allele frequency was established in a sample of 286 dogs from a veterinary clinic. This frequency was compared to the allelic frequency in 599 samples specifically sent for genetic testing. While the allelic frequency in the sample for genetic testing was high (21.6%) and in line with the general reports, the allelic frequency in the clinical setting was low (0.2%), demonstrating an enormous difference between laboratory and clinical frequencies. Because of the low frequency of the disease-causing variant in the general clinical population, the risk of encountering a dog displaying multidrug sensitivity despite not genotyping seems to be low. As the variant was only found in an at-risk breed, the current recommendation of routinely genotyping at-risk breeds before treatment seems justified."
https://openalex.org/W4293469433,"Abiraterone acetate and enzalutamide are commonly employed in prostate cancer therapy in an interchangeable manner. These drugs are highly efficacious in androgen antagonism to improve patient outcomes, but they also carry noteworthy risk of adverse effects. Common toxicities vary amongst the two drugs and may have differential interactions with patient co-morbidities, but these patterns are unclear as co-morbidities typically serve as exclusion criteria in clinical trials. Hence, there is no existing guidance on how clinicians may tailor treatment based on patient-specific factors. Analysis of differential patient outcomes between these two drugs can inform future systematic reviews, new clinical studies, and clinical decision making.The framework for this methodology was informed by the Joanna Briggs Institute methodology for scoping reviews. Title and abstract screening will be performed by two independent researchers to create an initial study inventory. This will be followed by full-text screening for study inclusion. Population-based studies describing patient outcomes, common toxicities, and associations with patient co-morbidities following abiraterone or enzalutamide therapy will be included. After data is extracted, it will be summarized for presentation.The findings of this scoping review will be published in a peer-reviewed journal. The results will be used to inform future studies on patient-specific factors informing treatment choice between abiraterone and enzalutamide for castration-resistant prostate cancer. All data are from published openly accessible sources, and therefore, no ethical clearance is necessary. The protocol is also registered at https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.19149227."
https://openalex.org/W4293469487,"Monitoring HIV prevalence using antenatal HIV sentinel surveillance is important for efficient epidemic tracking, programme planning and resource allocation. HIV sentinel surveillance usually employs unlinked anonymous HIV testing which raises ethical, epidemiological and public health challenges in the current era of universal test and treat. The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that countries should consider using routine prevention of mother-to-child transmission of HIV (PMTCT) data for surveillance. We audited antenatal care clinics to assess the quality of HIV rapid testing practices as the first step to assess whether South Africa is ready to utilize PMTCT programme data for antenatal HIV surveillance. In 2017, we conducted a cross-sectional survey in 360 randomly sampled antenatal care clinics using the adapted WHO Stepwise-Process-for-Improving-the-Quality-of-HIV-Rapid-Testing (SPI-RT) checklist. We calculated median percentage scores within a domain (domain-specific median score), and across all domains (overall median percentage scores). The latter was used to classify sites according to five implementation levels; (from 0:&lt;40% to 4: 90% or higher). Of 346 (96.1%) facilities assessed, an overall median percentage score of 62.1% (inter-quartile range (IQR): 50.8–71.9%) was obtained. The lowest domain-specific median percentage scores were obtained under training/certification (35% IQR: 10.0–50.0%) and external quality assurance (12.5% IQR: 0.0–50.0%), respectively. The majority (89%) of sites had an overall median score at level 2 or below; of these, 37% required improvement in specific areas and 6.4% in all areas. Facilities in districts implementing the HIV Rapid Test Quality Improvement Initiative and supported by the President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) had significantly higher median overall scores (65.6% IQR: 53.9–74.2%) (P-value from rank sum test: &lt;0.001) compared with non–PEPFAR–supported facilities (56.6% IQR:47.7–66.0%). We found sub-optimal implementation of HIV rapid testing practices. We recommend the expansion of the PEPFAR-funded Rapid Test Continuous Quality Improvement (RTCQI) support to all antenatal care testing sites."
https://openalex.org/W4293469518,"Most image content modelling methods are designed for English description which is different form Chinese in syntax structure. The few existing Chinese image description models do not fully integrate the global features and the local features of an image, limiting the capability of the models to represent the details of the image. In this paper, an encoder-decoder architecture based on the fusion of global and local features is used to describe the Chinese image content. In the encoding stage, the global and local features of the image are extracted by the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and the target detection network, and fed to the feature fusion module. In the decoding stage, an image feature attention mechanism is used to calculate the weights of word vectors, and a new gating mechanism is added to the traditional Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network to emphasize the fused image features, and the corresponding word vectors. In the description generation stage, the beam search algorithm is used to optimize the word vector generation process. The integration of global and local features of the image is strengthened to allow the model to fully understand the details of the image through the above three stages. The experimental results show that the model improves the quality of Chinese description of image content. Compared with the baseline model, the score of CIDEr evaluation index improves by 20.07%, and other evaluation indices also improve significantly."
https://openalex.org/W4293493664,"For positioning an object with m references, there are m-1 linearly independent range differences and measuring them is essential. However, none of m(m-1) possible range differences should be considered redundant unless their measurements are free of noise and locations of the references are exactly known. From all available range-difference measurements, m range measurements are obtained for positioning based on the least squares principle. The problem formulation treats missing and weighted range-difference measurements simultaneously. The exact relationships among several formulations of least squares positioning are established. A numerical example illustrates the results."
https://openalex.org/W4293579396,"Wolbachia Hertig, 1936 is an intracellular bacterial symbiont colonizing many arthropods. Of the studies done on the bacteria present in the superfamily Gerroidea Leach, 1815, no report of Wolbachia infection had yet been made. Thus, we checked the presence of Wolbachia in six Gerroidea species which colonize tropical aquatic environments by PCR using wsp primer set before sequencing and phylogenetic analyses. Insects were collected in the marine fringe of mangroves, in river estuaries, in swampy mangroves, and in ponds from Guadeloupe islands (Caribbean). Two new strains of Wolbachia were detected in these Gerroidea. They were named wLfran and wRmang. The wsp sequences suggest that the strains belong to the already described E supergroup or similar. wLfran is present in Limnogonus franciscanus Stål, 1859 and Rheumatobates trinitatis (China, 1943) while wRmang appears to be present exclusively in R. mangrovensis (China, 1943). Three other species were analysed, but did not appear to be infected: Brachymetra albinerva (Amyot & Serville, 1843), Halobates micans Eschscheltz, 1822, and Microvelia pulchella Westwood, 1834. The results presented here highlight for the first time the presence of new intracellular Wolbachia strains in Gerroidea colonising tropical aquatic environments like mangrove habitats from inlands to sea shore."
https://openalex.org/W4293579602,"We present a short review of discrete-time quantum walks (DTQW) as a potentially useful and rich formalism to model human decision-making. We present a pedagogical introduction of the underlying formalism and main structural properties. We suggest that DTQW are particularly suitable for combining the two strands of literature on evidence accumulator models and on the quantum formalism of cognition. Due to the additional spin degree of freedom, models based on DTQW allow for a natural modeling of model choice and confidence rating in separate bases. Levels of introspection and self-assessment during choice deliberations can be modeled by the introduction of a probability for measurement of either position and/or spin of the DTQW, where each measurement act leads to a partial decoherence (corresponding to a step towards rationalization) of the deliberation process. We show how quantum walks predict observed probabilistic misperception like S-shaped subjective probability and conjunction fallacy. Our framework emphasizes the close relationship between response times and type of preferences and of responses. In particular, decision theories based on DTQW do not need to invoke two systems (""fast"" and ""slow"") as in dual process theories. Within our DTQW framework, the two fast and slow systems are replaced by a single system, but with two types of self-assessment or introspection. The ""thinking fast"" regime is obtained with no or little self-assessment, while the ""thinking slow"" regime corresponds to a strong rate of self-assessment. We predict a trade-off between speed and accuracy, as empirically reported."
https://openalex.org/W4293579662,"Visiting multiple prescribers is a common method for obtaining prescription opioids for nonmedical use and has played an important role in fueling the United States opioid epidemic, leading to increased drug use disorder and overdose. Recent studies show that centrality of the bipartite network formed by prescription ties between patients and prescribers of opioids is a promising indicator for drug seeking. However, node prominence in bipartite networks is typically estimated with methods that do not fully account for the two-mode topology of the underlying network. Although several algorithms have been proposed recently to address this challenge, it is unclear how these algorithms perform on real-world networks. Here, we compare their performance in the context of identifying opioid drug seeking behaviors by applying them to massive bipartite networks of patients and providers extracted from insurance claims data. We find that two variants of bipartite centrality are significantly better predictors of subsequent opioid overdose than traditional centrality estimates. Moreover, we show that incorporating non-network attributes such as the potency of the opioid prescriptions into the measures can further improve their performance. These findings can be reproduced on different datasets. Our results demonstrate the potential of bipartiteness-aware indices for identifying patterns of high-risk behavior."
https://openalex.org/W4293611540,"Yeast and humans have a few rather noticeable differences. Yet many details of human biochemistry were first worked out in yeast, insights inherited from the days when yeast cells were much more genetically tractable than human cells. Then, the challenge for human biologists was to determine which findings could be translated from yeast and which were not shared between fungi and mammals. The mitogen-activated protein kinases, or MAPKs, are an example. Initially identified in yeast, these enzymes respond to growth factors and cytokines recognized by receptor tyrosine kinases, along with physiological stressors, and regulate processes in growth, proliferation, and response to stress. They act in multiple-kinase cascades: a MAP kinase kinase kinase activates a MAP kinase kinase, which in turn activates the MAPK itself, which phosphorylates transcription factors and other substrates. The avalanche of enzymatic activation amplifies what may be a small initial stimulus into a robust cellular response (1Kuriyan J. Konforti B. Wemmer D. The Molecules of Life: Physical and Chemical Principles. (Textbook). Garland Science/Taylor & Francis, London, UK2013Google Scholar). The enzymes at the effector end of the cascade, MAPKs, all share an activation loop that can be phosphorylated on closely juxtaposed tyrosine and threonine residues. Various MAPKs are activated under different circumstances and activate different transcription factors—yet sometimes, researchers observed in the 1990s, their activity would overlap, creating responses in yeast that seemed to depend on numerous MAPKs (2Chen R. Thorner J. Function and regulation in MAPK signaling pathways: lessons learned from the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2007; 1773: 1311-1340Crossref PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar). It was unclear which of those complex findings from yeast—if any—would translate to mammalian biology. After the first MAPK was found in human cells, University of Massachusetts Medical School professor Roger Davis said, researchers reasoned that if yeast had numerous MAPKs, humans might have many as well (3Boulton T. Yancopoulos G. Gregory J. Slaughter C. Moomaw C. Hsu J. et al.An insulin-stimulated protein kinase similar to yeast kinases involved in cell cycle control.Science. 1990; 249: 64-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar). Davis said, “There was essentially an explosion of cloning.” The kinase p38 was identified as part of that explosion (4Han J. Lee J.-D. Bibbs L. Ulevitch R.J. A MAP kinase targeted by endotoxin and hyperosmolarity in mammalian cells.Science. 1994; 266: 808-811Crossref Scopus (2431) Google Scholar, 5Rouse J. Cohen P. Trigon S. Morange M. Alonso-Llamazares A. Zamanillo D. et al.A novel kinase cascade triggered by stress and heat shock that stimulates MAPKAP kinase-2 and phosphorylation of the small heat shock proteins.Cell. 1997; 78: 1027-1037Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (1513) Google Scholar). p38 showed high homology to a yeast kinase called HOG1 and shared some features with known MAPKs, but it also had a slightly unusual activation loop sequence. Davis said, “The big question was, is it truly a MAPK?” Davis, whose lab studied the related Jun kinase, or JNK, at the time, quickly became interested in p38 because the two enzymes responded to similar stimuli, such as inflammatory cytokines, heat and osmotic shock, and UV irradiation. A classic article that Davis’s lab published in the Journal of Biological Chemistry in 1995 helped to establish that p38 was genuinely a MAPK (6Raingeaud J. Gupta S. Rogers J. Dickens M. Han J. Ulevitch R. et al.Pro-inflammatory cytokines and environmental stress cause p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase activation by dual phosphorylation on tyrosine and threonine.J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7420-7426Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2055) Google Scholar). Through careful biochemical characterization, the lab demonstrated that p38 was phosphorylated on both tyrosine and threonine residues in a three amino acid activation loop—a key feature of MAPK biology (7Cobb M. Goldsmith E. How MAP kinases are regulated.J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14843-14846Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1667) Google Scholar). They also identified a substrate, the transcription factor ATF2, allowing them to develop a functional assay to study p38 activity. With that ability in hand, they examined the differences between p38 and JNK activity in response to stressors such as UV irradiation and endotoxin. First author Joel Raingeaud said, “We were expecting in terms of specificity of target—the transcription factor—or time course of activation, it would be a bit different.” Indeed, they found that the two kinases had distinct activation kinetics, suggesting that p38 had a place of its own in the tangled wiring diagram of MAPK signaling. Around the same time, the lab also demonstrated that the activation pathways for p38, JNK, and Erk are separate and generally independent, using different kinase kinases (8Derijard B. Raingeaud J. Barret T. Wu I. Han J. Ulevitch R. et al.Independent human MAP-kinase signal transduction pathways defined by MEK and MKK isoforms.Science. 1995; 267: 682-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (1417) Google Scholar). Davis said, “They are clearly separate pathways, but they also have overlapping substrates.” Having established some commonalities p38 shared with its fellow MAPKs and some differences that distinguished them, the lab published its findings just 11 months after the discovery of p38 had been reported. However, Davis said the study was not completed in any particular rush “At the time, we were good at doing exactly what was described in that paper,” he said. “Every method and technique was very routine in the laboratory.” In the ensuing decades, researchers have come to appreciate even greater complexity in the MAPK pathways. For example, human cells have 14 MAPKs, including four genes encoding variants of p38 and three JNKs (9Cargnello M. Roux P. Activation and function of the MAPKs and their substrates, the MAPK-activated protein kinases.Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2011; 75: 50-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (2040) Google Scholar). Additional isoforms of each kinase are produced through alternative splicing, while tissue-specific expression patterns, docking sites, and scaffolding proteins regulate interactions between kinases and their substrates (10Hotamisligil G. Davis R. Cell signaling and stress responses.Cold Spring Harb. Perspect. Biol. 2016; 8a006072Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). “The biochemistry gets quite complicated—but it also provides opportunities,” Davis said. That is, if specific isoforms or protein–protein interactions are only important in specific cell types or signaling contexts, they may be targets for treating disease. Davis’s lab now focuses on JNK and its contribution to inflammation related to metabolic disease and cancer. The lab is interested in understanding what differentiates the two kinase populations and finding treatment strategies that exploit those differences. Davis received a phone call from a citation tracking service a few years after the article was published. The article had been so widely cited, they said, that they wondered why he had published in the Journal of Biological Chemistry. He said he told them, “This was a perfect JBC paper… and it was published in exactly the right journal for the right audience.”"
https://openalex.org/W4293678294,"Prostate cancer (PCa) continues to threaten men's health, and treatment targeting the androgen receptor (AR) pathway is the major therapy for PCa patients. Several second-generation androgen receptor inhibitors (SG-ARIs), including enzalutamide (ENZ), apalutamide (APA) and darolutamide (DARO), have been developed to better block the activity of AR. Unavoidably, emergence of resistance to these novel drugs still persists. Herein, we identified glutathione S-transferase Mu 2 (GSTM2) as an important determinant in the acquisition of resistance to SG-ARIs. Elevated GSTM2 was detected in enzalutamide-resistant (ENZ-R) PCa, and overexpression of GSTM2 in naïve enzalutamide-sensitive (ENZ-S) cells effectively transformed them to ENZ-R PCa. Aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR), the upstream transcription factor, was implicated in the overexpression of GSTM2 in ENZ-R cells. Mechanistically, GSTM2 antagonized the effect of ENZ by rescuing cells from oxidative stress-associated damage and activation of p38 MAPK pathway. Surprisingly, high GSTM2 levels also associated with cross-resistance to APA and DARO. Taking together, these results provide new insight to ameliorate resistance to SG-ARIs and improve treatment outcome."
https://openalex.org/W4293699314,"Commerce has had positive impacts on the whole agri-food value chain at different stages, it was developed rapidly in rural China in the past few years. E-commerce participation can promote the use intensity of organic fertilizers (OF) and this could achieve many benefits for different stakeholders including ensuring food safety, positive environmental impacts and promoting the adoption of green production technologies. Therefore, this study has used primary data collected from 733 fruit farmers in rural China to explore the impact of e-commerce participation on fruit farmers' use intensity of (OF). Unlike previous studies investigating the dichotomous decision of (OF) adoption, this study captures the use intensity of (OF) from both input quantity and cost aspects. We employed an endogenous switching regression (ESR) model to address selectivity bias caused by observed and unobserved factors. The results show that e-commerce participation significantly increases the use intensity of (OF) in input quantity and cost by 19.48% and 29.50%, respectively. Heterogeneous analysis further reveals that compared to fruit farmers with a low e-commerce participation level, fruit farmers with a high e-commerce participation level have higher (OF) use intensity. The findings also show that risk preference, human capital, cultivated area, cooperative membership and government restraint mechanisms positively and significantly affect the probability of fruit farmers' participation in e-commerce and fruit farmers' use intensity of (OF). The results emphasize that e-commerce promotion is an efficient way to encourage farmers to adopt (OF), which help improve product quality and promote sustainable agricultural development."
