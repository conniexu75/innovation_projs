https://openalex.org/W2071185249,"The massive, evergreen coniferous forests in the Pacific Northwest are unique among temperate forest regions of the world. The region's forests escaped decimation during Pleistocene glaciation; they are now dominated by a few broadly distributed and well-adapted conifers that grow to large size and great age. Large trees with evergreen needle- or scale-like leaves have distinct advantages under the current climatic regime. Photosynthesis and nutrient uptake and storage are possible during the relatively warm, wet fall and winter months. High evaporative demand during the warm, dry summer reduces photosynthesis. Deciduous hardwoods are repeatedly at a disadvantage in competing with conifers in the regional climate. Their photosynthesis is predominantly limited to the growing season when evaporative demand is high and water is often limiting. Most nutrients needed are also less available at this time. The large size attained by conifers provides a buffer against environmental stress (especially for nutrients and moisture). The long duration between destructive fires and storms permits conifers to outgrow hardwoods with more limited stature and life spans."

Sodium beta alumina, a Na(+) conductor, and LixTiS(2), an intercalation compound with simultaneous Li(+) and electronic conductivity, are two of the best and most versatile fast ionic conductors. A wide variety of cations can replace Na(+) in beta alumina and Li(+) in LixTiS(2) and change the properties of the materials. Sodium beta alumina and LixTiS(2) are currently used in the development of high-energy density batteries for electric vehicles and electrical utility load leveling. Current research in solid ionic conductors is exploring new intercalation compounds, solid polymer electrolytes, and alkali ion and proton transport in crystalline solids."

https://openalex.org/W1973296015,"IF we go back a generation, say to the early '80's, we find up to this time most of the work published by American botanists was taxonomic. For some time before this, however, evidences of an awakening to other aspects of the science were evident and the next decade brought an extraordinary extension of botanical interest in ther lin s of work. Morphology, physiology, and especially cytology began *to demand attention. This was the period also when the government began to consider seriously the application of botanical science to the great agricultural problems of the country. Most of the agricultural experiment stations, date from this time, and it is unnecessary to point out the great influence which these have had in directing the activities of so many of the ablest workers in the field of botany. As one looks back over this period of some thirty-five years one can not but be struck with the great increase in the number of botanical workers and the enormous number of publications recording the results of their work."

https://openalex.org/W2015782630,"IT is perhaps presumptuous for an experimental physicist to address a body of mathematicians. He can at best appeal. They are the arbiters of his science. They determine the number of cubic feet allotted for his antics. In a genial mood, they may give him the equivalent number of cubic centimeters. Physicists appreciate the clemency. Let nobody contend that there are, necessarily, laws of nature. In science, as in civil law, the experts in a measure make the facts. So I appeal to the law-givers of physics, with a purpose of exhibiting something of the method with which they have supposedly treated me, in the past forty years of my experience. If I am obtrusively personal I must be pardoned, for this is the only experience I have to give. We, the experimentalists, are supposed to be the artists of science, a type of men who reach conclusions by intuition, by a happy leap in the dark. The inventor, the laboratory hermit, parades an essentially feminine type of mind, whereas the eternal masculine, the essentially logical trenchency, belongs to the mathematician. In all humility, however, in the dark recesses of the laboratory, there are skeptics who believe that both the physicist and the mathematician, in the main, follow the method of trial and error; that both develop from idea to idea. The usual outcome in the mathematical case is a huge paper basket, overflowing and standing in the waste; the outcome in the other, a sort of dismal morgue, a junk-shop of botches. Failures have been the rule, successes the exception. But as we flaunt our successes (and they only"
