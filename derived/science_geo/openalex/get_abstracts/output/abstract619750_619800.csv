https://openalex.org/W2896434012,"As the main agricultural insect pollinator, the honey bee (Apis mellifera) is exposed to a number of agrochemicals, including glyphosate (GLY), the most widely used herbicide. Actually, GLY has been detected in honey and bee pollen baskets. However, its impact on the honey bee brood is poorly explored. Therefore, we assessed the effects of GLY on larval development under chronic exposure during in vitro rearing. Even though this procedure does not account for social compensatory mechanisms such as brood care by adult workers, it allows us to control the herbicide dose, homogenize nutrition and minimize environmental stress. Our results show that brood fed with food containing GLY traces (1.25–5.0 mg per litre of food) had a higher proportion of larvae with delayed moulting and reduced weight. Our assessment also indicates a non-monotonic dose-response and variability in the effects among colonies. Differences in genetic diversity could explain the variation in susceptibility to GLY. Accordingly, the transcription of immune/detoxifying genes in the guts of larvae exposed to GLY was variably regulated among the colonies studied. Consequently, under laboratory conditions, the response of honey bees to GLY indicates that it is a stressor that affects larval development depending on individual and colony susceptibility."
https://openalex.org/W2896214969,"The blood-brain barrier (BBB) limits transport of nanoparticles from the circulation to the brain parenchyma. Angiopep-2, a peptide which functions as a brain transport vector, can be coupled to nanoparticles in order to facilitate binding and internalization by brain endothelial cells (ECs), and subsequent BBB penetration. This multi-step process may be affected by blood flow over brain ECs, as flow influences endothelial cell phenotype as well as interactions of nanoparticles with ECs. In the present study a microfluidic BBB model was constructed to evaluate binding and internalization by brain ECs, as well as BBB penetration of Angiopep-2 coupled liposomes (Ang2-Liposomes) in static and flow conditions. Ang2 conjugation to liposomes markedly improved binding relative to unconjugated liposomes. Ang2-Liposomes bound and were internalized efficiently by brain endothelial cells after static incubation or with 1 dyne/cm2 of fluid shear stress (FSS), while binding was reduced at a FSS of 6 dyne/cm2. Penetration of the model microfluidic BBB by Ang2-Liposomes was higher at a FSS of 1 dyne/cm2 and 6 dyne/cm2 than with static incubation. Analysis of barrier function and control experiments for receptor-mediated penetration provided insight into the magnitude of transcellular versus paracellular transport at each tested FSS. Overall, the results demonstrate that flow impacted the binding and BBB penetration of Ang2-functionalized nanoparticles. This highlights the relevance of the local flow environment for in vitro modeling of the performance of nanoparticles functionalized with BBB penetrating ligands."

Design Retrospective, cross-sectional study. Participants One hundred and four patients of whom 72 were in Group 1 (active nAMD) and 32 in Group 2 (remission nAMD) based on SD-OCT (Spectral Domain OCT) qualitative morphology. Methods This study was conducted at the Centre Ophtalmologique de l’Odeon between June 2016 and December 2017. Eyes were analyzed using SD-OCT and high-speed (100 000 A-scans/second) 1050-nm wavelength swept-source OCT-A. Speckle noise removal and choroidal neovascularization (CNV) blood flow delineation were automatically performed. Quantitative parameters analyzed included blood flow area (Area), vessel density, fractal dimension (FD) and lacunarity. OCT-A image algorithms and graphical user interfaces were built as a unified tool in Matlab coding language. Generalized Additive Models were used to study the association between OCT-A parameters and nAMD remission on structural OCT. The models’ performance was assessed by the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC), Brier Score and by the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). A p value of ≤ 0.05 was considered as statistically significant. Results Area, vessel density and FD were different (p<0.001) in the two groups. Regarding the association with CNV activity, Area alone had the highest AUC (AUC = 0.85; 95%CI: 0.77–0.93) followed by FD (AUC = 0.80; 95%CI: 0.71–0.88). Again, Area obtained the best values followed by FD in the AIC and Brier Score evaluations. The multivariate model that included both these variables attained the best performance considering all assessment criteria. Conclusions Blood flow characteristics on OCT-A may be associated with exudative signs on structural OCT. In the future, analyses of OCT-A quantitative parameters could potentially help evaluate CNV activity status and to develop personalized treatment and follow-up cycles."
https://openalex.org/W2897205963,"Background A variety of global-level monitoring initiatives have recommended indicators for tracking progress in maternal and newborn health. As a first step supporting the work of WHO’s Mother and Newborn Information for Tracking Outcomes and Results (MoNITOR) Technical Advisory Group, we aimed to compile and synthesize recommended indicators in order to document the landscape of maternal and newborn measurement and monitoring. Methods We conducted a scoping review of indicators proposed by global multi-stakeholder groups to suggest next steps to further support maternal and newborn measurement and monitoring. Indicators pertaining to pregnancy, childbirth, and postpartum/postnatal and newborn care were extracted and included in the indicator compilation, together with key indicator metadata. We examined patterns and relationships across the compiled indicators. Results We identified 140 indicators linked to maternal and newborn health topics across the continuum of service provision. Fifty-five indicators relate to inputs and processes, 30 indicators relate to outputs, outcomes comprise 37 indicators in the database, and 18 impact indicators. A quarter of indicators proposed by global groups is either under development/discussion or is considered “aspirational”, highlighting the currently evolving monitoring landscape. Although considerable efforts have been made to harmonize indicator recommendations, there are still relatively few indicators shared across key monitoring initiatives and some of those that are shared may have definitional variation. Conclusion Rapid, wide-ranging work by a number of multi-stakeholder groups has resulted in a substantial number of indicators, many of which partially overlap and many are not supported with adequate documentation or guidance. The volume of indicators, coupled with the number of initiatives promoting different indicator lists, highlight the need for strengthened coordination and technical leadership to harmonize recommendations for improved measurement and monitoring of data related to maternal and newborn heath."
https://openalex.org/W2897826048,"Background MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are emerging as central regulators of inflammation, but their role in asthma and airway epithelial cells is not well studied. Glucocorticoids are the cornerstone of therapy in asthma and other inflammatory disease, yet their mechanisms of action are not completely elucidated, and it is not clear whether miRNAs modulate their effects. Objective We aimed to identify miRNAs that regulate cytokine and chemokine expression in airway epithelial cells and whether these miRNAs are subject to the effects of glucocorticoids. Methods and results MicroRNAomic analyses of immortalized, normal human bronchial epithelial cells identified 7 miRNAs that were altered by inflammatory cytokine treatment and 22 that were regulated by glucocorticoids (n = 3 for each treatment condition). MiR-146a emerged as a central candidate, whose expression was induced by TNF-α and repressed by glucocorticoids. Its role as a candidate in asthmatic inflammation was supported by expression profiling in human asthmatics, which showed that plasma miR-146a expression was elevated in asthma and associated with measures related to worse asthma outcomes, including elevated blood eosinophil counts, higher asthma control questionnaire scores, and need for higher doses of inhaled glucocorticoids. However, transfection of miR-146a in A549 cells treated with TNF-α +/- glucocorticoids produced an anti-inflammatory effect and increased efficacy of glucocorticoids. Conclusions We propose a model whereby miR-146a is induced by inflammatory conditions as a feedback mechanism to limit inflammation. Exogenous administration of miR-146a augmented the effects of glucocorticoids and could be a novel therapeutic strategy to enhance efficacy of these medications."
https://openalex.org/W2897707387,"A Recommender System (RS) is an intelligent system that assists users in finding the items of their interest (e.g. books, movies, music) by preventing them to go through huge piles of data available online. In an effort to overcome the data sparsity issue in recommender systems, this research incorporates a content based filtering technique with fuzzy inference system and a conformal prediction approach introducing a new framework called Hybrid Content based Fuzzy Conformal Recommender System (HCF-CRS). The proposed framework is implemented to be used in the domain of movies and it provides quality recommendations to users with a confidence level and an improved accuracy. In our proposed framework, first, a Content Based Filtering (CBF) technique is applied to create a user profile by considering the history of each user. CBF is useful in the situations like: lack of demographic information and the data sparsity problems. Second, a Fuzzy based technique is incorporated to find the similarities and differences between the user profile and the movies in the dataset using a set of fuzzy rules to get a predicted rating for each movie. Third, a Conformal prediction algorithm is implemented to calculate the non-conformity measure between the predicted ratings produced by fuzzy system and the actual ratings from the dataset. A p-value (confidence measure) is computed to give a level of confidence to each recommended item and a bound is set on the confidence level called a significance level ε, according to which the movies only above the specified significance level are recommended to user. By building a confidence centric hybrid conformal recommender system using the content based filtering approach with fuzzy logic and conformal prediction algorithm, the reliability and the accuracy of the system is considerably enhanced. The experiments are evaluated on MovieLens and Movie Tweetings datasets for recommending movies to the users and they are compared with other state-of-the-art recommender systems. Finally, the results confirm that the proposed algorithms perform better than the traditional ones."
https://openalex.org/W2597680358,"Background Tobacco consumption constitutes a sizable portion of household consumption expenditure, which can lead to reduced expenditures on other basic commodities. This is known as the crowding-out effect. This study analyzes the crowding-out effect of tobacco consumption in Bangladesh, and the research findings have relevance for strengthening the tobacco control for improving health and well-being. Methods We analyzed data from the Bangladesh Household Income and Expenditure Survey 2010 to examine the differences in consumption expenditure pattern between tobacco user and non-user households. We further categorize tobacco user households in three mutually exclusive groups of smoking-only, smokeless-only, and dual (both smoking and smokeless); and investigated the crowding-out effects for these subgroups. We compared the mean expenditure shares of different types of households, and then estimated the conditional Engel curves for various expenditure categories using Seemingly Unrelated Regression (SUR) method. Crowding-out was considered to have occurred if estimated coefficient of the tobacco use indicator was negative and statistically significant. Results We find that tobacco user households on average allocated less in clothing, housing, education, energy, and transportation and communication compared to tobacco non-user households. The SUR estimates also confirmed crowding-out in these consumption categories. Mean expenditure share of food and medical expenditure of tobacco user households, however, are greater than those of tobacco non-user households. Albeit similar patterns observed for different tobacco user households, there were differences in magnitudes depending on the type of tobacco-use, rural-urban locations and economic status. Conclusion Policy measures that reduce tobacco use could reduce displacement of commodities by households with tobacco users, including those commodities that can contribute to human capital investments."
https://openalex.org/W2897181241,"Cancer cachexia is a severe, debilitating condition characterized by progressive body wasting associated with remarkable loss of skeletal muscle weight. It has been reported that cancer cachexia disturbs the regenerative ability of skeletal muscle, but the cellular mechanisms are still unknown. Here, we investigated the skeletal muscle regenerative process in mouse colon-26 (C26) tumor cell-bearing mice as a C26 cancer cachexia model. Although the proliferation and differentiation abilities of muscle stem cells derived from the C26 tumor cell-bearing mice were sustained in vitro, the proliferation and differentiation were severely impaired in the cachexic mice. The numbers of both macrophages and mesenchymal progenitors, which are critical players in muscle regeneration, were reduced in the cancer cachexic mice, indicating that the skeletal muscle regeneration process was disrupted by cancer cachexia. Furthermore, the number of infiltrated neutrophils was also reduced in cancer cachexia mice 24 hours after muscle injury, and the expression of critical chemokines for muscle regeneration was reduced in cancer cachexia model mice compared to control mice. Collectively, although the ability to regeneration of MuSCs was retained, cancer cachexia disturbed skeletal muscle regenerative ability by inhibiting the orchestrated muscle regeneration processes."
https://openalex.org/W2897034790,"Cassava is a staple food for people across sub-Saharan Africa. Over the last 20 years, there has been an increased frequency of outbreaks and crop damage in this region caused by the cassava-adapted Bemisia tabaci putative species. Little is known about when and why B. tabaci adults move and colonize new cassava crops, especially in farming systems that contain a mixture of cultivar types and plant ages. Here, we assessed experimentally whether the age and variety of cassava affected the density of B. tabaci. We also tested whether the age and variety of the source cassava field affected the variety preference of B. tabaci when they colonized new cassava plants. We placed uninfested potted “sentinel” plants of three cassava varieties (Nam 130, Nase 14, and Njule Red) in source fields containing one of two varieties (Nam 130 or Nase 14) and one of three age classes (young, medium, or old). After two weeks, the numbers of nymphs on the sentinel plants were used as a measure of colonization. Molecular identification revealed that the B. tabaci species was sub-Saharan Africa 1 (SSA1). We found a positive correlation between the density of nymphs on sentinel plants and the density of adults in the source field. The density of nymphs on the sentinels was not significantly related to the age of the source field. Bemisia tabaci adults did not preferentially colonize the sentinel plant of the same variety as the source field. There was a significant interactive effect, however, between the source and sentinel variety that may indicate variability in colonization. We conclude that managing cassava source fields to reduce B. tabaci abundance will be more effective than manipulating nearby varieties. We also suggest that planting a “whitefly sink” variety is unlikely to reduce B. tabaci SSA1 populations unless fields are managed to reduce B. tabaci densities using other integrative approaches."
https://openalex.org/W2897526955,"Recent studies have shown that HDAC inhibitors act synergistically with camptothecin derivatives in combination therapies. To exploit this synergy, new hybrid molecules targeting simultaneously topoisomerase I and HDAC were designed. In particular, a selected multivalent agent containing a camptothecin and a SAHA-like template showed a broad spectrum of antiproliferative activity, with IC50 values in the nanomolar range. Preliminary in vivo results indicated a strong antitumor activity on human mesothelioma primary cell line MM473 orthotopically xenografted in CD-1 nude mice and very high tolerability."
https://openalex.org/W2897714929,"Feline astrovirus (FeAstV) which belonged to the genus Mamastrovirus was first identified in the feces of kittens with diarrhea in the USA in 1981 by electron microscopy, and had been reported in many countries. Presently, there are no any reports of the circulation of FeAstV in mainland China. We performed this study to investigate the apparent prevalence and genetic variability of FeAstV infected in cats in mainland China for the first time. We tested fecal samples of 105 cats with diarrhea and 92 asymptomatic cats in five cities in northeast China by RT-PCR targeting RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) gene of FeAstV, and analyzed sequences variability and phylogenetic evolution based on the complete capsid gene of FeAstV strains obtained from positive samples. The overall prevalence of FeAstV was 23.4% (46/197) of which 38 were tested in cats with diarrhea (36.2%, 38/105) and 8 were in asymptomatic cats (8.7%, 8/92). Mixed infection with other enteroviruses including feline parvovirus (FPV), feline bocavirus (FBoV) and feline kobuvirus (FeKoV) was found in 38 FeAstV-positive samples. Phylogenetic analysis based on the complete capsid gene revealed all FeAstV strains were divided into two different groups with a 0.454±0.016 of mean amino acid genetic distance between two groups, suggesting that FeAstVs should be classified into two different genotype species. This study provided the first molecular evidence that FeAstV with considerable genetic diversity was circulating in northeast China, and analyzed genetic variability and classification of FeAstVs for the first time."
https://openalex.org/W2897058785,"Background Due to inconclusive evidence on the effects of foot orthoses treatment on lower limb kinematics and kinetics in children, studies are needed that particularly evaluate the long-term use of foot orthoses on lower limb alignment during walking. Thus, the main objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of long-term treatment with arch support foot orthoses versus a sham condition on lower extremity kinematics and kinetics during walking in children with flexible flat feet. Methods Thirty boys aged 8–12 years with flexible flat feet participated in this study. While the experimental group (n = 15) used medial arch support foot orthoses during everyday activities over a period of four months, the control group (n = 15) received flat 2-mm-thick insoles (i.e., sham condition) for the same time period. Before and after the intervention period, walking kinematics and ground reaction forces were collected. Results Significant group by time interactions were observed during walking at preferred gait speed for maximum ankle eversion, maximum ankle internal rotation angle, minimum knee abduction angle, maximum knee abduction angle, maximum knee external rotation angle, maximum knee internal rotation angle, maximum hip extension angle, and maximum hip external rotation angle in favor of the foot orthoses group. In addition, statistically significant group by time interactions were detected for maximum posterior, and vertical ground reaction forces in favor of the foot orthoses group. Conclusions The long-term use of arch support foot orthoses proved to be feasible and effective in boys with flexible flat feet to improve lower limb alignment during walking."
https://openalex.org/W2897450910,"Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia is one of the most frequent severe bacterial infections worldwide, with an associated mortality of about 20-40% in developed countries. In 2013, we noted an increase in this infection in the teaching hospital in Grenoble, France, compared to 2012. The mean incidence of S. aureus bacteremia was 0.28 per 1,000 patient-days in 2012 and 0.35 per 1,000 patient-days in 2013. This trend was confirmed in 2014 (0.35 per 1,000 patient-days). In the present work we aimed to study the population of patients presenting with S. aureus bacteremia in 2013 and to genotype the corresponding S. aureus strains in order to identify a successful and/or virulent genotype to design a specific infection control program. One hundred ninety-one S. aureus isolates (including 9 methicillin-resistant) out of 199 corresponding cases of bacteremia were characterized with the spa typing method. Among 108 spa types, t571, t002, t008 and t084 were the most prevalent. Although not widely prevalent, t571 was the most frequently identified clone (8.4% of all isolates). Spa type t571 has been described in previous studies as belonging to the clonal complex CC398, which is consistent with the recent emergence of methicillin-susceptible S. aureus CC398 reported in blood cultures in Europe."
https://openalex.org/W2895921319,"Background The wide range of potential applications has made the Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) a ubiquitous tool in the field of Molecular Biology. Within this context, it is increasingly appealing to embed BLAST services within larger Web applications. Results This work introduces BlasterJS viewer, a new JavaScript library for the lightweight development of Web-based applications supporting the visualisation of BLAST outputs. BlasterJS detaches from similar data viewers by focusing on the visual and interactive display of sequence similarity results and being completely independent of BLAST services. BlasterJS is compatible with the text outputs generated by the BLAST family of programs, namely BLASTp, BLASTn, BLASTx, tBLASTn, and tBLASTx, and works in all major Web browsers. Furthermore, BlasterJS is available through the EBI’s BioJS registry 5, which extends its potential use to a wider scope of bioinformatics applications.

https://openalex.org/W2896541189,"Different computational approaches are employed to efficiently identify novel repositioning possibilities utilizing different sources of information and algorithms. It is critical to propose high-valued candidate-repositioning possibilities before conducting lengthy in vivo validation studies that consume significant resources. Here we report a novel multi-methodological approach to identify opportunities for drug repositioning. We performed analyses of real-world data (RWD) acquired from the United States Food and Drug Administration’s Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) and the claims database maintained by the Japan Medical Data Center (JMDC). These analyses were followed by cross-validation through bioinformatics analyses of gene expression data. Inverse associations revealed using disproportionality analysis (DPA) and sequence symmetry analysis (SSA) were used to detect potential drug-repositioning signals. To evaluate the validity of the approach, we conducted a feasibility study to identify marketed drugs with the potential for treating inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Primary analyses of the FAERS and JMDC claims databases identified psycholeptics such as haloperidol, diazepam, and hydroxyzine as candidates that may improve the treatment of IBD. To further investigate the mechanistic relevance between hit compounds and disease pathology, we conducted bioinformatics analyses of the associations of the gene expression profiles of these compounds with disease. We identified common biological features among genes differentially expressed with or without compound treatment as well as disease-perturbation data available from open sources, which strengthened the mechanistic rationale of our initial findings. We further identified pathways such as cytokine signaling that are influenced by these drugs. These pathways are relevant to pathologies and can serve as alternative targets of therapy. Integrative analysis of RWD such as those available from adverse-event databases, claims databases, and transcriptome analyses represent an effective approach that adds value to efficiently identifying potential novel therapeutic opportunities."
https://openalex.org/W2896722999,"Vocal communication is used across the animal kingdom to transfer information from emitters to receivers, such as size, sex, age, dominance status or even emotional states. The transmission of an emotional state from one individual to another is called ""emotional contagion"" and is classified as the first level of empathy. Emotional contagion is thought to be stronger between familiar individuals. While affiliation represents a stronger relation between individuals than mere familiarity, it remains understudied whether affiliation modulates emotional reactions as well. Using cockatiels (Nymphicus hollandicus), we played back three types of audio stimuli to individual birds: a partner's distress call (emitted when birds are caught or forcibly restrained), a non-partner's distress call, and a control sound (white noise). The calls were recorded from familiar birds with either low (non-partners) or high levels of affiliation (partners). The subjects' response was scored using four behavioural parameters: the time spent near the loudspeaker, the amount of movements, the number of calls emitted, and the position of the crest. Across all variables, birds were more attentive and active when confronted to distress calls compared to control sounds, particularly when the distress call was emitted from a partner rather than a non-partner. These results raise the possibility that distress calls do not only function as a stimulus-triggering automatic reaction in cockatiels but also transmit emotions. Moreover, affiliation enhanced emotional reactions to conspecific distress calls. Our data provides first insights into the mechanisms of emotional contagion in parrots."
https://openalex.org/W2896626193,"We aimed to compare the clinical outcomes between endovascular treatment and inframalleolar bypass surgery for critical limb ischemia (CLI) in patients with thromboangiitis obliterans (TAO) and to assess the role of bypass surgery in the era of innovative endovascular treatment. Between January 2007 and December 2017, a total of 33 consecutive patients with the diagnosis of TAO presenting with CLI who underwent endovascular treatment (endovascular group, n = 22) or bypass surgery to the pedal or plantar vessels (bypass group, n = 11) were included and analyzed retrospectively. The primary endpoint was defined as a major amputation of the index limb, and the secondary endpoint was defined as graft occlusion, regardless of the number of subsequent procedures. In the bypass group, six patients (55%) had undergone previous failed endovascular procedures and/or arterial bypass surgery to the index limb before inframalleolar bypass, and two patients (18%) received microvascular flap reconstruction after bypass surgery. During the median follow-up period of 32 months (range 1–115 months), there were no significant differences in primary and secondary endpoints between the two groups although the bypass group had a higher Rutherford class than the endovascular group. Kaplan–Meier survival analysis showed that there were similar limb salvage (P = 0.95) and graft patency rates (P = 0.39). In conclusion, endovascular treatment is a valid strategy leading to an acceptable limb salvage rate for TAO patients, and surgical bypass to distal target vessels could play a vital role in cases of previous failed endovascular treatment or extensive soft tissue loss of the foot."
https://openalex.org/W2896667152,"Sepsis is a common and deadly complication among trauma and surgical patients. Neutrophils must mobilize to the site of infection to initiate an immediate immune response. To quantify the velocity of spontaneous migrating blood neutrophils, we utilized novel microfluidic approaches on whole blood samples from septic and healthy individuals. A prospective study at a level 1 trauma and tertiary care center was performed with peripheral blood samples collected at <12 hours, 4 days, and/or 14 days relative to study initiation. Blood samples were also collected from healthy subjects. Ex vivo spontaneous neutrophil migration was measured on 2 μl of whole blood using microfluidic devices and time-lapse imaging. For each sample, individual neutrophils were tracked to calculate mean instantaneous velocity. Forty blood samples were collected from 33 patients with sepsis, and 15 blood samples were collected from age- and gender-matched healthy, control subjects. Average age was 61 years for septic patients with a male predominance (67%). Overall, average spontaneous neutrophil migration velocity in septic samples was 16.9 μm/min, significantly lower than controls samples at 21.1 μm/min (p = 0.0135). Neutrophil velocity was reduced the greatest at <12 hours after sepsis (14.5 μm/min). Regression analysis demonstrated a significant, positive correlation between neutrophil velocity and days after sepsis (p = 0.0059). There was no significant association between neutrophil velocity and age, gender, APACHE II score, SOFA score, sepsis severity, total white blood cell count, or percentage of neutrophils. Circulating levels of the cytokines IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, MCP-1, IP-10, and TNF were additionally measured using bead-based multiplex assay and found to peak at <12 hours and be significantly increased in patients with sepsis at all three time points (<12 hours, 4 days, and 14 days after sepsis) compared to healthy subjects. In conclusion, these findings may demonstrate an impaired ability of neutrophils to respond to sites of infection during the proinflammatory phase of sepsis."
https://openalex.org/W2898001330,"Background Besides use of insecticide-treated mosquito nets (ITNs) and indoor residual spraying (IRS), other complimentary measures including suitable housing structures, and environmental management that reduce breeding of malaria vectors, can be implemented at households to prevent the disease. However, most studies on malaria prevention have focused mainly on ITNs and IRS. The aim of this study was therefore to assess malaria prevention practices beyond ITNs and IRS, and associated environmental risk factors including housing structure in rural Wakiso district, Uganda. Methods A clustered cross-sectional survey was conducted among 727 households in Wakiso district. Data were collected using an interviewer-administered questionnaire and observational checklist. The questionnaire assessed participants’ household practices on malaria prevention, whereas the checklist recorded environmental risk factors for malaria transmission, and structural condition of houses. Poisson regression modeling was used to identify factors associated with use of mosquito nets by households. Results Of the 727 households, 471 (64.8%) owned at least one mosquito net. Use of mosquito nets by households was higher with increasing education level of participants—primary (aPR = 1.27 [95% CI: 1.00–1.60]), secondary (ordinary level) (aPR = 1.47 [95% CI: 1.16–1.85]) and advanced level / tertiary (aPR = 1.55 [95% CI: 1.19–2.01]), and higher household income (aPR = 1.09 [95% CI: 1.00–1.20]). Additionally, participants who were not employed were less likely to have mosquito nets used in their households (aPR = 0.83 [95% CI: 0.70–0.98]). Houses that had undergone IRS in the previous 12 months were 42 (5.8%), while 220 (43.2%) households closed their windows before 6.00 pm. Environmental risk factors found at households included presence of vessels that could potentially hold water for mosquito breeding 414 (56.9%), and stagnant water in compounds 144 (19.8%). Several structural deficiencies on houses that could promote entry of mosquitoes were found such as lack of screening in ventilators 645 (94.7%), and external doors not fitting perfectly into walls hence potential for mosquito entry 305 (42.0%). Conclusion There is need to increase coverage and utilisation of ITNs and IRS for malaria prevention in Wakiso district, Uganda. In addition, other malaria prevention strategies such as environmental management, and improving structural condition of houses are required to strengthen existing malaria prevention approaches."
https://openalex.org/W2895787856,"Dizziness is common in older people. Physicians are often unable to identify a specific cause for dizziness in older people, even after an extensive diagnostic work-up. A prognosis-oriented approach, i.e. treating modifiable risk factors for an unfavourable course of dizziness, may reduce dizziness-related impairment in older people in primary care.Cluster randomized controlled trial.45 primary care practices in The Netherlands.168 participants aged ≥65y who consulted their general practitioner for dizziness and experienced significant dizziness-related impairment (Dizziness Handicap Inventory (DHI) ≥30). Participants were part of to the intervention group (n = 83) or control group (n = 85), depending on whether they were enlisted in an intervention practice or in a control practice.The multifactorial intervention consisted of: medication adjustment in case of ≥3 prescribed fall-risk-increasing drugs (FRIDs) and/or stepped mental health care in case of anxiety disorder and/or depression and/or exercise therapy in case of impaired functional mobility. The intervention was compared to usual care.The primary outcome was dizziness-related impairment. Secondary outcomes were quality of life (QoL), dizziness frequency, fall frequency, anxiety and depression, use of FRIDs.Intention-to-treat analysis showed no significant intervention effect on dizziness-related impairment (DHI score difference -0.69 [95% CI -5.66;4.28]; p = 0.79). The intervention proved effective in reducing the number of FRIDs (FRID difference -0.48 [95% CI -0.89;-0.06]; p = 0.02). No significant intervention effects were found on other secondary outcomes. The uptake of and adherence to the interventions was significantly lower in patients eligible for ≥2 interventions compared to patients eligible for one intervention (p<0.001).The multifactorial intervention for dizziness in older patients showed no significant intervention effect on most outcomes and adherence to the multifactorial intervention was low. Although multifactorial treatment for older dizzy people seems promising in theory, we question its feasibility in daily practice. Future research could focus on a sequential treatment for dizziness, e.g. measuring effectiveness of various evidence-based therapies in a stepwise approach."
https://openalex.org/W2896311198,"Background Previously, using microarrays and mRNA-Sequencing (mRNA-Seq) we found that occupational exposure to a range of benzene levels perturbed gene expression in peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Objectives In the current study, we sought to identify gene expression biomarkers predictive of benzene exposure below 1 part per million (ppm), the occupational standard in the U.S. Methods First, we used the nCounter platform to validate altered expression of 30 genes in 33 unexposed controls and 57 subjects exposed to benzene (<1 to ≥5 ppm). Second, we used SuperLearner (SL) to identify a minimal number of genes for which altered expression could predict <1 ppm benzene exposure, in 44 subjects with a mean air benzene level of 0.55±0.248 ppm (minimum 0.203ppm). Results nCounter and microarray expression levels were highly correlated (coefficients >0.7, p<0.05) for 26 microarray-selected genes. nCounter and mRNA-Seq levels were poorly correlated for 4 mRNA-Seq-selected genes. Using negative binomial regression with adjustment for covariates and multiple testing, we confirmed differential expression of 23 microarray-selected genes in the entire benzene-exposed group, and 27 genes in the <1 ppm-exposed subgroup, compared with the control group. Using SL, we identified 3 pairs of genes that could predict <1 ppm benzene exposure with cross-validated AUC estimates >0.9 (p<0.0001) and were not predictive of other exposures (nickel, arsenic, smoking, stress). The predictive gene pairs are PRG2/CLEC5A, NFKBI/CLEC5A, and ACSL1/CLEC5A. They play roles in innate immunity and inflammatory responses. Conclusions Using nCounter and SL, we validated the altered expression of multiple mRNAs by benzene and identified gene pairs predictive of exposure to benzene at levels below the US occupational standard of 1ppm."
https://openalex.org/W2897081068,"Background Pulmonary hypertension (PH) is a common complication of chronic respiratory disease. Recent studies have reported diabetes mellitus (DM) to be a poor prognostic factor in patients with chronic respiratory disease, including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or interstitial pneumoniae. However, the association between DM and PH in chronic respiratory disease remains unclear. In this study, we aimed to investigate whether DM is a predictor of PH in patients with chronic respiratory disease. Methods We prospectively analyzed 386 patients in our hospital with chronic respiratory disease. An echocardiographic pressure gradient between the right atrium and the right ventricle of ≥ 40 mmHg was defined as PH. We compared the clinical characteristics and impact of DM between chronic respiratory disease patients with and those without PH. Results Of the 386 patients, 42 (10.9%) were diagnosed as having PH. The PH group had higher modified medical research council (mMRC) grade and complication rate of DM, but not hypertension and hyperlipidemia, when compared to the non-PH group. Multivariable logistic regression analysis revealed that mMRC scale (odds ratio 1.702, 95% confidence interval, 1.297 to 2.232, P < 0.001) and presence of DM (odd ratio 2.935, 95% confidence interval, 1.505 to 5.725, P = 0.002) were associated with PH in chronic respiratory disease patients. Conclusion DM is potentially associated with PH and is an independent factor for prediction of PH in patients with chronic respiratory disease."
https://openalex.org/W2896397949,"Desalination of geothermal brackish water by membrane distillation (MD) provides a low recovery rate, but integrating MD with reverse osmosis (RO) can maximize the production rate. In this study, different design configurations of a hybrid system involving brine recycling and cascading are studied via simulations, and the performance improvement due to the process integration is substantiated via the increased recovery rate and reduced specific energy consumption. Brine recycling is also found to improve the recovery rate considerably to 40% at an energy cost of 0.9 $/m3. However, this achievement is only valid when the final brine is recycled to the RO feed: when the final brine is recycled to the MD feed, the overall performance degrades because the recycled brine cools the feed and causes a serious reduction in the driving force and the consequent production rate. Configuring the hybrid system in multiple stages connected in series increases the recovery rate to 90% and reduces the specific energy consumption to 0.9 MJ/kg. Although the specific energy cost increases dramatically because external inter-stage heating is implemented, using a free energy source (such as a geothermal or waste-energy source) for inter-stage heating could provide the optimum configuration."
https://openalex.org/W2897824901,"Objectives The shortage of emergency drugs in China is severe. This study aimed to characterize emergency drug shortages in China and to measure their effects. Methods An online questionnaire based on a literature review was sent to emergency department physicians in Chinese secondary and tertiary hospitals from November 2016 to February 2017. The survey asked physicians questions about their experiences with emergency drug shortages. Results In total, 236 physicians from 29 provinces participated in the survey. According to their responses, 90.7% of the respondents experienced drug shortages during the last year. More than half of the physicians (65.7%) reported that drug shortages occurred at least once a month. Hospitals in the eastern and western regions of China had more emergency drugs in shortage than hospitals in central China, especially those with many inpatient beds (≥800). In addition, the shortage situation was more serious in secondary hospitals than in tertiary hospitals. More respondents agreed that original medicines, injections, essential medicines, medicines without alternative agents and cheap medicines were more susceptible to shortages than generics, oral medicines, nonessential medicines, medicines with alternative agents and expensive medicines, respectively. Most respondents thought that drug shortages always, often or sometimes affected patients [delayed therapy (62.6%), longer rescue and recovery times (58.9%) and higher costs (58.7%)] and physicians [inconvenience (81.0%), higher pressure (76.5%) and harm to patient-doctor relationships (72%)] and compromised hospital reputations (55.1%). Conclusions The shortage of emergency drugs in China is serious, especially in secondary hospitals located in eastern and western China. Emergency drug shortages have significant effects on patients and physicians."
https://openalex.org/W2896065429,"Myeloperoxidase (MPO) is a heme-containing peroxidase found in azurophilic granules of neutrophils and monocytes. Epidemiological studies have reported greater plasma MPO concentration to be associated with increased incidence of several cardiovascular diseases (CVD), but the association of intracellular monocyte MPO (mMPO) with CVD is unclear. The prospective population-based Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) cohort study measured mMPO using flow cytometry in 1,465 participants. The association of mMPO with incident cardiovascular disease (CVD, comprising incident coronary heart disease (CHD), heart failure, stroke, peripheral artery disease, and cardiovascular mortality) was examined over a median 9.6 years of follow-up (n = 290 CVD events). There was no statistically significant association between mMPO and all incident CVD events in either age, sex, and race-adjusted proportional hazards models (HR (95% CI) across tertiles of mMPO: 1, 1.09 (0.76, 1.57), and 0.78 (0.52, 1.15), P-trend = 0.21) or adjusted for other major CVD risk factors (HR (95% CI): 1, 1.17 (0.81, 1.69), and 0.87 (0.58, 1.29), P-trend = 0.50). There also was no association between mMPO tertiles and incident CHD, heart failure, or all-cause mortality, examined separately. In conclusion, intracellular monocyte myeloperoxidase was not associated with incident cardiovascular disease in this prospective population-based study."
https://openalex.org/W2896793284,"Neurotropic tick borne encephalitis virus (TBEV) causes life-threatening disease, and accounts for most cases of tick-transmitted viral infections in Central and Eastern Europe and Russia. No specific treatment for TBEV infections exists, and vaccination is recommended for people at risk. So far, various nucleoside analogues have been investigated in vitro as potential candidates for treatment of TBEV infections. However, in vitro experiments with more complex cell culture systems, such as organotypic culture slices which model the sophisticated architecture of the target tissue are lacking. Using TBEV as a model, we investigated the suitability of rat organotypic cerebellum slices (OCS) to study the effectiveness of nucleoside analogues with a well-known anti-TBEV activity. In these OCS, 50 μM of the nucleoside analogues 2’-C-methyladenosine (2’-CMA) and especially 7-deaza-2’-C-methyladenosine (7-deaza-2’-CMA) exhibited strong inhibitory effects on TBEV replication, reducing viral titers to an average of 103-fold and TBEV RNA content 60-90-fold. In contrast, the influence of 2’-C-methylcytidine (2’-CMC) on TBEV replication was very weak, reducing virus titers by 10-fold and TBEV RNA content by 3-fold. In agreement with other studies, there was no noticeable difference in TBEV titers between OCS treated with 50 μM of Ribavirin and the DMSO treated controls. All tested nucleoside analogues exhibited excellent cytotoxicity profiles at concentrations of 50 μM. Our findings in OCS were highly comparable to data obtained in cell line culture systems. Therefore, OCS represent an ideal in vitro approach to study antivirals against TBEV and possibly other neurotropic viruses."
https://openalex.org/W2897005215,"Background The southern Amazon Basin in the Madre de Dios region of Peru has undergone rapid deforestation and habitat disruption, leading to an unknown zoonotic risk to the growing communities in the area. Methodology/Principal findings We surveyed the prevalence of rodent-borne Leptospira and Bartonella, as well as potential environmental sources of human exposure to Leptospira, in 4 communities along the Inter-Oceanic Highway in Madre de Dios. During the rainy and dry seasons of 2014–2015, we captured a total of 97 rodents representing 8 genera in areas that had experienced different degrees of habitat disturbance. Primarily by using 16S metagenomic sequencing, we found that most of the rodents (78%) tested positive for Bartonella, whereas 24% were positive for Leptospira; however, the patterns differed across seasons and the extent of habitat disruption. A high prevalence of Bartonella was identified in animals captured across both trapping seasons (72%–83%) and the relative abundance was correlated with increasing level of land disturbance. Leptospira-positive animals were more than twice as prevalent during the rainy season (37%) as during the dry season (14%). A seasonal fluctuation across the rainy, dry, and mid seasons was also apparent in environmental samples tested for Leptospira (range, 55%–89% of samples testing positive), and there was a high prevalence of this bacteria across all sites that were sampled in the communities. Conclusions/Significance These data indicate the need for increased awareness of rodent-borne disease and the potential for environmental spread along the communities in areas undergoing significant land-use change."
https://openalex.org/W2897997912,"Objectives The paucity of safety information on intrauterine devices (IUD) for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) examinations is clinically relevant. The aim of this study is to evaluate the MRI safety of clinically used IUDs composed of copper/gold and stainless steel at 1.5T and 3.0T. Materials and methods We assessed and compared the displacement force, torque effects, presence of imaging artifacts and heating of IUDs composed of copper/gold (western IUDs) and stainless steel (China) on 1.5 and 3.0T MRI systems. Results Gold/Copper IUDs can show small deflection angles of 7° ± 7° in the worst-case field gradient of 40T/m (equivalent to magnetic force of 0.5 mN), while the stainless steel IUD experienced significant magnetic force and deflection (Force > 7.5 N; deflection angle 90° ± 1°). Manual rotation and suspension method show no torque effects on gold/copper IUDs but high torque effects were observed by manual rotation on the stainless steel IUD. Heating measurements showed a temperature increase (rescaled to a wbSAR of 4 W/kg) of 1.4°C at 1.5T / 3.4°C at 3.0 T (stainless steel IUD), 3.2°C at 1.5 T / 3.8°C at 3 T (copper/gold IUD), 3.3°C at 1.5 T / 4.8°C at 3 T (copper 1), 3.8°C at 1.5 T / 4.8°C at 3 T (copper 2). The visible imaging artifacts of the copper and gold IUDs at 3 T MRI reach a diameter of 4 mm ± 1 mm, while the stainless steel IUD resulted in artifacts measuring 200mm ± 10 mm when using gradient echo pulse sequences. Conclusions Standard IUDs (copper/gold) can be considered as conditional for MR safety at 1.5 T and 3.0 T, demonstrating at wbSAR up to 4W/kg and a magnetic field gradient of up to 40T/m with minimal imaging artifacts. The stainless steel IUD, however, induces unacceptable artifacts and is potentially harmful to patients during MRI due to high magnetic dislocation forces and torque (MR unsafe)."
https://openalex.org/W2896695645,"Context Despite the high prevalence of work disability due to common mental disorders (CMD), no information exists on the rates and predictors of recurrence in a United States population. Objective To estimate recurrent work disability statistics and evaluate factors associated with recurrence due to CMDs including adjustment, anxiety, bipolar, and depressive disorders. Methods Recurrent work disability statistics were calculated using a nationwide database of disability claims. For the CMDs, univariate and multiple variable analyses were used to examine demographic factors and comorbidities associated with the time to recurrence. Results Of the CMDs, cases with bipolar (n = 3,017) and depressive disorders (n = 20,058) had the highest recurrence densities, 98.7 and 70.9 per 1000 person-years, respectively. These rates were more than three times higher than recurrence rates for other chronic disorders (e.g., diabetes, asthma; n = 105,558) and non-chronic disorders (e.g., injury, acute illnesses; n = 153,786). Individuals with CMD were also more likely to have a subsequent disability distinct from their mental health condition. Risk factors for recurrent CMD disability included being younger, being an hourly employee, living in a geographic area with more college graduates, having more previous psychiatric visits, having a previous work leave, and the type of work industry. Conclusions Results indicate that CMD patients may benefit from additional care and disability management both during and after their work absence to help prevent subsequent CMD and non-CMD related leaves."
https://openalex.org/W2896893098,"Introduction Treatment success rates of rifampicin resistant (RR)/multi-drug resistant (MDR) tuberculosis (TB) in South Africa range from 43–48%, falling short of the World Health Organization’s target of ≥75%. We present rates and assess predictors of attrition by 12 months on treatment. Methods Prospective observational cohort analysis of adults (≥18 years) initiating RR/MDR-TB treatment from 01 March 2013 to 30 September 2016. Attrition was defined as a combination of death and loss to follow-up (LTFU; treatment interruption ≥2 months) by 12 months on treatment. Predictors of attrition were identified using Cox Proportional Hazards models to estimate crude (HR) and adjusted hazard ratios (aHR) with corresponding 95% confidence intervals. Results By 12 months on treatment, 75/240 (31.3%) patients had either died (37/240; 15.4%) or been LTFU (38/240; 15.8%). Patients with moderate/severe anaemia (aHR: 2.10; 95% CI 1.00–4.39), and those who were smear positive at baseline (aHR: 2.04; 95% CI 1.01–4.12) were significantly more likely to die or be lost from care. Conclusion At this outpatient DR-TB treatment site, there was a high rate of attrition halfway through the standard treatment course at 12 months of 31%. High rates of attrition by 12 months on treatment may continue during the second-half of therapy."
https://openalex.org/W2896906477,Behavioral studies show that motor actions are planned by adapting motor programs to produce desired visual consequences. Does this mean that the brain plans these visual consequences independent of the motor actions required to obtain them? Here we addressed this question by investigating planning-related fMRI activity in human posterior parietal (PPC) and dorsal premotor (PMd) cortex. By manipulating visual movement of a virtual end-effector controlled via button presses we could dissociate motor actions from their sensory outcome. A clear representation of the visual consequences was visible in both PPC and PMd activity during early planning stages. Our findings suggest that in both PPC and PMd action plans are initially represented on the basis of the desired sensory outcomes while later activity shifts towards representing motor programs.
https://openalex.org/W2896938210,"Rabies is a zoonotic viral disease that can affect all mammals. In the United States, the majority of human rabies cases are caused by bats, which are the only known reservoirs for rabies virus (RABV) in Washington State. We sought to characterize bat RABV epidemiology in Washington among bats submitted by the public for RABV testing.We examined temporal and spatial trends in RABV positivity (% positive) for taxonomically identified bats submitted to diagnostic laboratories during 2006-2017. For a subset of Myotis species, we evaluated sensitivity and predictive value positive (PPV) of morphological identification keys, using mitochondrial markers (cytochrome b) as a reference. For bats tested during 2000-2016, we analyzed RABV positivity by circumstances of encounters with humans, cats, and dogs.During 2006-2017, RABV positivity for all bat species was 6.0% (176/2,928). Among species with ≥100 submissions, RABV positivity was 2.0%-11.7% and highest among big brown bats (Eptesicus fuscus). An increasing trend in annual positivity was significant only for big brown bats (P = 0.02), and was circumstantially linked to a geographic cluster. Sensitivity and PPV of morphological identification keys was high for M. evotis but varied for M. lucifugus, M. californicus, M. yumanensis, and M. septentrionalis. A positive RABV result was significantly associated with nonsynanthropic species, abnormal behavior, abnormal hiding, injury, biting, found in a body of water, found alive, found outdoors, and caught by a dog.Monitoring passive RABV surveillance trends enables public health authorities to perform more accurate risk assessments. Differences in temporal and spatial trends in RABV positivity by bat species indicate the importance of collecting taxonomic data, although morphological identification can be unreliable for certain Myotis species. Current public health practices for RABV exposures should be maintained as RABV infection in bats can never be excluded without diagnostic testing."
https://openalex.org/W2897065879,"This paper evaluates a novel high variability phonetic training paradigm that involves presenting spoken words in adverse conditions. The effectiveness, generalizability, and longevity of this high variability phonetic training in adverse conditions was evaluated using English phoneme contrasts in three experiments with Malaysian multilinguals. Adverse conditions were created by presenting spoken words against background multi-talker babble. In Experiment 1, the adverse condition level was set at a fixed level throughout the training and in Experiment 2 the adverse condition level was determined for each participant before training using an adaptive staircase procedure. To explore the effectiveness and sustainability of the training, phonemic discrimination ability was assessed before and immediately after training (Experiments 1 and 2) and 6 months after training (Experiment 3). Generalization of training was evaluated within and across phonemic contrasts using trained and untrained stimuli. Results revealed significant perceptual improvements after just three 20-minute training sessions and these improvements were maintained after 6 months. The training benefits also generalized from trained to untrained stimuli. Crucially, perceptual improvements were significantly larger when the adverse conditions were adapted before each training session than when it was set at a fixed level. As the training improvements observed here are markedly larger than those reported in the literature, this indicates that the individualized phonetic training regime in adaptive adverse conditions (HVPT-AAC) is highly effective at improving speech perception."
https://openalex.org/W2896340396,"Proximal remote sensing is being used across a very wide range of research fields and by scientists, who are often without deep theoretical knowledge optical physics; the author of this article falls squarely in that category! This article highlights two optical phenomena, which may greatly influence the quality and robustness of proximal remote sensing: penetration and scattering. Penetration implies that acquired reflectance signals are associated with both physical and chemical properties of target objects from both the surface and internal tissues/structures. Scattering implies that reflectance signals acquired from one point or object are influenced by scattered radiometric energy from neighboring points or objects. Based on a series of laboratory experiments, penetration and scattering were discussed in the context of “robustness” (repeatability) of hyperspectral reflectance data. High robustness implies that it is possible to control imaging conditions and therefore: 1) obtain very similar radiometric signals from inert objects (objects that do not change) over time, and 2) be able to consistently distinguish objects that are otherwise highly similar in appearance (size, shape, and color) and in terms of biochemical composition. It was demonstrated that robustness of hyperspectral reflectance data (40 spectral bands from 385 to 1024 nm) were significantly influenced by penetration and scattering of radiometric energy. In addition, it was demonstrated that the influence of penetration and scattering varied across the examined spectrum. Characterization of how optical phenomena may affect the robustness of reflectance data is important when using proximal remote sensing technologies as tools used to classify engineering and biological objects."
https://openalex.org/W2897348552,"Acute central nervous system (CNS) infections in children in sub-Saharan Africa are often fatal. Potential contributors include late presentation, limited diagnostic capacity and inadequate treatment. A more nuanced understanding of treatment practices with a goal of optimizing such practices is critical to prevent avoidable case fatality. We describe empiric antimicrobial treatment, antibiotic resistance and treatment adequacy in a prospective cohort of 459 children aged two months to 12 years hospitalised for suspected acute CNS infections in Mbarara, Uganda, from 2009 to 2012. Among these 459 children, 155 had a laboratory-confirmed diagnosis of malaria (case-fatality rate [CFR] 14%), 58 had bacterial infections (CFR 24%) and 6 children had mixed malaria and bacterial infections (CFR 17%). Overall case fatality was 18.1% (n = 83). Of 219 children with laboratory-confirmed malaria and/or bacterial infections, 182 (83.1%) received an adequate antimalarial and/or antibiotic on the day of admission and 211 (96.3%) within 48 hours of admission. The proportion of those receiving adequate treatment was similar among survivors and non-survivors. All bacterial isolates were sensitive to ceftriaxone except one Escherichia coli isolate with extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL). The observed high mortality was not a result of inadequate initial antimicrobial treatment at the hospital. The epidemiology of CNS infection in this setting justifies empirical use of a third-generation cephalosporin, however antibiotic resistance should be monitored closely."
https://openalex.org/W2897459449,"HIV incidence information is essential for epidemic monitoring and evaluating preventive interventions. However, reliable HIV incidence data is difficult to obtain, especially among marginalized populations, such as young men who have sex with men (YMSM). Here we evaluate the reliability of an alternative HIV incidence assessment method, behavioral imputation, as compared to serologically estimated HIV incidence. Recent HIV incidence among YMSM (aged 18 to 21 and 18 to 24 years) enrolled in a cohort study in Bangkok from 2006 to 2014 was estimated using two mid-point methods for seroconversion: 1) between age of first anal intercourse and first HIV-positive test (without previous HIV-negative test) (behavioral imputation) and 2) between the date of last negative and first positive HIV test (serological estimation). Serologically estimated HIV incidence was taken as the “gold standard” to evaluate between-method agreement. At baseline, 314 YMSM age 18 to 21 years accumulated 674 person-years (PY) of follow-up since first anal intercourse. Considering that 50 men had prevalent HIV infection, the behaviorally imputed HIV incidence was 7.4 per 100 PY. Of the remaining 264 HIV-negative men, 54 seroconverted for HIV infection during the study, accumulating 724 PY of follow-up and a serologically estimated HIV incidence of 7.5 per 100 PY. At baseline, 712 YMSM age 18 to 24 years (including 18 to 21-year-old men analyzed above) accumulated 2143 PY of follow-up since first anal intercourse. Considering that 151 men had prevalent HIV infection, the behaviorally imputed HIV incidence was 7.0 per 100 PY. Of the remaining 561 HIV-negative men, 125 seroconverted for HIV infection during the study, accumulating 1700 PY of follow-up and a serologically estimated HIV incidence of 7.4 per 100 PY. Behavioral imputation and serological estimation are in good agreement when estimating recent HIV incidence in YMSM."
https://openalex.org/W2897582587,"Background Clot retraction in intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) has been described and postulated to be related to effective hemostasis and perihematoma edema (PHE) formation. The incidence and quantitative extent of hematoma retraction (HR) is unknown. Our aim was to determine the incidence of HR between baseline and time of admission. We also tested the hypothesis that patients with HR had higher PHE volume and good prognosis. Methods This was a retrospective single-centre study in which serial planimetric volume measurements of the total hematoma volume (parenchymal (IPH) and intraventricular (IVH)) and PHE were performed in ICH patients with baseline non-contrast computed tomography (CT) completed within 6 hours of onset and follow-up CT 24 (±12) hours from symptom onset. HR was defined as a decrease in volume of >3ml or >15%, and hematoma expansion (HE) as an increase of >6ml or >30%. All other patients were categorized as stable hematoma (HS). Good outcome was defined as modified Rankin Scale (mRS) 0–2 at 90 days. Results A total of 136 patients (mean age = 69.3±13.39 years, 58.1% male) were included. Median (interquartile range) baseline total hematoma volume was 14.96 (7.80, 31.88) ml. HR >3ml and >15% occurred in 6 (4.4%) and 8 (5.9%) patients, respectively. Neither definition of HR was associated with follow-up PHE (p>0.297) or good outcome (p>0.249). IVH was the only independent predictor of HR (p<0.0241). Conclusions Early HR is rare and associated with IVH, but not with PHE or clinical outcome. There was no relationship between HR, PHE, and patient prognosis. Therefore, HR is unlikely to be a useful endpoint in clinical ICH studies."
https://openalex.org/W2963484595,"Recently, Li et al. proposed a novel smart card and dynamic ID-based remote user authentication scheme for multi-server environments. They claimed that their scheme can resist several types of attacks. However, through careful analysis, we find that Li et al.’s scheme is vulnerable to stolen smart card and off-line dictionary attacks, replay attacks, impersonation attacks and server spoofing attacks. By analyzing other similar schemes, we find that a certain type of dynamic ID-based multi-server authentication scheme in which only hash functions are used and whereby no registration center participates in the authentication and session key agreement phase faces difficulties in providing perfectly efficient and secure authentication. To compensate for these shortcomings, we propose a novel dynamic ID-based remote user authentication scheme for multi-server environments based on pairing and self-certified public keys. Security and performance analyses show that the proposed scheme is secure against various attacks and has many excellent features."
https://openalex.org/W2896119167,"The effect that a motor skill trained on one side can lead to improvement in the untrained side is called intermanual transfer. Intermanual transfer can help enhance upper limb prosthetic training. To determine the influence of mirror therapy and motor imagery on intermanual transfer in upper limb prosthesis training, a pseudo-randomized clinical trial, single blinded, with a pre-posttest design was used. Forty-seven able-bodied, right-handed participants were pseudo-randomly assigned to two training groups and one control group. One training group undertook an intermanual transfer training program, using an upper-limb prosthetic simulator with added mirror therapy and motor imagery. The second training group completed only the intermanual transfer training program. The control group completed a sham training: a dummy training without using the prosthesis simulator. The program lasted five consecutive days. To determine the improvement in skill, a test was administered before, immediately after, and six days after the training program. Training used the “unaffected” arm; tests were performed with the “affected” arm, resembling the amputated limb. Movement time, the time from the beginning of the movement until completion of the task; hand opening, the duration of the maximum prosthetic hand opening; and grip-force control, the deviation from the required force during a tracking task. No intermanual transfer effects were found: neither the intermanual transfer training program, nor the additional mirror therapy and motor imagery affected prosthesis skills. A limitation of the study was that the training program was applied to able-bodied subjects instead of patients with an amputation. Contrary to previous studies, no intermanual transfer effects were found. Additional mirror therapy and motor imagery did not ameliorate intermanual transfer effects."
https://openalex.org/W2897216274,"The lack of suitable animal models for the study of cytoadhesion of P. falciparum-infected erythrocytes (IEs) has necessitated in vitro studies employing a range of cell lines of either human tumour origin (e.g., BeWo and C32 cells) or non-human origin (e.g., CHO cells). Of the human cells available, many were isolated from adults, or derived from a pool of donors (e.g., HBEC-5i). Here we demonstrate, for the first time, the successful isolation of blood outgrowth endothelial cells (BOECs) from frozen stabilates of peripheral blood mononuclear cells obtained from small-volume peripheral blood samples from paediatric malaria patients. BOECs are a sub-population of human endothelial cells, found within the peripheral blood. We demonstrate that these cells express receptors such as Intercellular Adhesion Molecule 1 (ICAM-1/CD54), Endothelial Protein C Receptor (EPCR/CD201), platelet/endothelial cell adhesion molecule 1 (PECAM-1/CD31), Thrombomodulin (CD141), and support adhesion of P. falciparum IEs."

https://openalex.org/W2896920574,"Background Finasteride, a 5-alpha reductase inhibitor may have effects on biomarkers such as prostate-specific antigen (PSA) that could be leveraged to improve screening. Objective To determine the predictive characteristics of biomarkers for prostate cancer for cancer on biopsy following 3 months of finasteride use compared with placebo. Design, setting and participants 383 men from multiple clinical sites with intermediate prostate cancer risk, without history of prostate cancer, were randomly allocated in a double-blinded manner, 4:1, to receive either finasteride or placebo for 90 days at which time a prostate biopsy was performed. Outcome measurements and statistical analysis The primary outcomes were associations of biomarkers with prostate cancer that were tested using multiple logistic regression and area under the receiver operating curves (AUC). Biomarkers for PCA risk (PCA3, TMPRSS2:ERG (T2:ERG) gene product, and PSA) were measured at baseline and at biopsy in a blinded fashion to assess the predictive performance of baseline levels, 90-day levels, and measures of change relative to standard predictors. Results and limitations A total of 292 (233 finasteride; 59 placebo) randomized patients underwent biopsy and were analyzed. On finasteride, baseline and 90-day measures of PCA3 and T2:ERG had similar moderate discrimination capacity with AUCs 62 to 65% (p-values < 0.001 and 0.001, respectively), but their rates of change had no discrimination ability (AUC 51%, (95% CI 43 to 60% p = 0.72) and 48% (95% CI 44 to 60%, p = 0.62), respectively).) Relative to baseline, the 90-day PCA3 and PSA decreased in the finasteride group by 25% and 50%, respectively (both p<0.001). T2:ERG had a smaller, non-significant change post finasteride treatment (p = 0.08). Conclusions Short-term finasteride therapy did not improve performance of the most commonly-employed prostate cancer biomarkers. Threshold values for new biomarkers of prostate cancer should be interpreted with caution in patients receiving finasteride until formal validation of test performance in these patients is conducted. Patient summary Three months of finasteride treatment did not increase the accuracy for predicting the outcome on prostate biopsy but did have a significant effect on biomarker values. Adjustments to thresholds for biopsy for men on finasteride are proposed. Trial registration ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT01296672."

Methods The original formula, calculated AH (cm) = 2.21 (height at initial evaluation, SD) + 2.32 (target height, SD) - 1.83 (luteinizing hormone/follicle-stimulating hormone peaks ratio) + 159.68, was established in a sample of 134 girls (group 4) and was applied to additional girls with CPP seen in the same center (group 1, n = 35), in Germany (group 2, n = 43) and in the Netherlands (group 3, n = 72). This formula has been updated based on these extended data, and both versions are available at the following location: http://www.kamick.org/lemaire/med/girls-cpp15.html. Results Despite the differences among the 4 groups in terms of their characteristics at the initial evaluation and the percentages of patients treated with the gonadotropin-releasing hormone analogue, they have similar calculated and actual AHs. The actual AHs are 162.2±7.0, 163.0±7.6, 162.4±7.7 and 162.1±5.6 cm in groups 1 to 4, respectively. They are highly correlated with the AHs calculated by the formula established in the original group (group 4), with R at 0.84, 0.67 and 0.69 in groups 1 to 3, respectively. When the actual AHs and the AHs predicted by the Bayley and Pinneau method are compared, the R is 0.76, 0.51 and 0.64 in groups 1 to 3, respectively. The absolute differences between actual AHs and the calculated AHs are greater than 1 SD (5.6 cm) in 15%, 35% and 28% of the patients in groups 1 to 3, respectively. Conclusion This study validates and updates the previously established formula for predicting AH in girls with CPP. This updated formula can help clinicians to make treatment decisions."
https://openalex.org/W2897601649,"Stroke is a devastating disease with a strong inflammatory component. It has been shown that part of this response is mediated by IL17+ γδT cells. γδT cells constitute a lymphocyte population with innate features that mainly populates epithelial surfaces including skin, intestine, and airways. We have shown that in the context of stroke, T cells migrate from the small intestine to the meninges but whether they can migrate from other epithelial surfaces is still unknown. Because of its proximity, one possible source of stroke-associated IL17+ γδT cells could be the Nasal-Associated Lymphoid Tissue (NALT) from which T cells could migrate along olfactory nerve sheaths through the cribriform plate into the brain and/or meninges. In order to study the role of NALT as a source for immune cells and/or inflammatory mediators in the context of stroke, we analyzed the effect of NALT ablation on immune cell infiltration and infarct volume after stroke. Infarct volume analysis did not show any significant difference between sham and NALT-ablated animals. In addition, no significant differences were found in immune cell infiltration in the brain or meninges of stroke animals subjected to NALT or Sham-ablation surgery. In conclusion, NALT ablation does not affect ischemic brain damage or immune cell infiltration in the meninges or brain after stroke."
https://openalex.org/W2951807229,"Despite the identification of many susceptibility genes our knowledge of the underlying mechanisms responsible for complex disease remains limited. Here, we identified a type 2 diabetes disease module in endosomes, and validate it for functional relevance on selected nodes. Using hepatic Golgi/endosomes fractions, we established a proteome of insulin receptor-containing endosomes that allowed the study of physical protein interaction networks on a type 2 diabetes background. The resulting collated network is formed by 313 nodes and 1147 edges with a topology organized around a few major hubs with Cdk2 displaying the highest collective influence. Overall, 88% of the nodes are associated with the type 2 diabetes genetic risk, including 101 new candidates. The Type 2 diabetes module is enriched with cytoskeleton and luminal acidification–dependent processes that are shared with secretion-related mechanisms. We identified new signaling pathways driven by Cdk2 and PTPLAD1 whose expression affects the association of the insulin receptor with TUBA, TUBB, the actin component ACTB and the endosomal sorting markers Rab5c and Rab11a. Therefore, the interactome of internalized insulin receptors reveals the presence of a type 2 diabetes disease module enriched in new layers of feedback loops required for insulin signaling, clearance and islet biology."
https://openalex.org/W2896433702,"Wound healing in animals is important to minimize the fitness costs of infection. Logically, a longer healing time is associated with higher risk of infection and higher energy loss. In wild mammals, wounds caused by aggressive intraspecific interactions can potentially have lethal repercussions. Clarifying wounding rate and healing time is therefore important for measuring the severity of the attacks. In addition, impact of secondary damage of wounds (e.g., accidental peeling off of scabs) on heeling time is unknown despite the risk of infection in wild mammals. In baboons, most male injuries have been reported to result from male to male fights. Here, we investigated the relationship between wound size and healing time in wild anubis baboons to clarify the healing cost of physical attacks including secondary damage of wounds. Observations were conducted daily between August 2016 and July 2017 in Kenya for seven adult male anubis baboons. The individual wound rate was one per month on average. In 16 cases, we were able to assess the number of days required for wound healing, and the median healing time was 13 d. Wound healing time was longer for larger wounds. When the scab was peeled off accidentally because of external factors, healing time became longer. One of the causes of scabs' peeling off was baboons' scab-picking behavior, and the behaviour was considered self-injurious behavior. However, its predicted healing cost might not be high. We concluded that wounds less than 800 mm2 (the largest observed in this study) in baboon males have little effect on survival. Our results suggest that lethal wounds by physical attacks rarely occur in male baboons, and that healing time and delay caused by secondary damages can be estimated by measuring wound area."
https://openalex.org/W2896469590,"We investigated the prevalence of maternal dissatisfaction with their child's body size and its associated factors among mothers of first- to third-grade elementary school students in private schools in the Federal District, Brazil. This is a cross-sectional study with 548 mother-schoolchildren pairs. We measured children’s weight and height, and collected their mother’s sociodemographic data and Body Mass Index using an online questionnaire. We also verified maternal body dissatisfaction and maternal dissatisfaction with their child's body size using Shape Scales. Most mothers (50.5%) were dissatisfied with their child's body size. Mothers of boys (Adjusted OR = 2.85) were more likely to want a larger silhouette for their child, while mothers of girls (Adjusted OR = 3.18), overweight (Adjusted OR = 24.83) and obese (Adjusted OR = 189.86) children were more likely to want a thinner silhouette for their child. A positive correlation was observed between maternal dissatisfaction with their own body and maternal dissatisfaction with their children's body size (rs = 0.178). There was a high prevalence of maternal dissatisfaction with their child's body size, particularly among mothers of overweight and obese children. Additional studies should be conducted to better understand the influence of this dissatisfaction on maternal practices and attitudes related to their child’s body, food consumption, and lifestyle."
https://openalex.org/W2896199901,"Background The Hong Kong Government released a Reference Framework (RF-HT) for Hypertension Care for Adults in Primary Care Settings since 2010. No studies have evaluated its adoption by primary care physicians (PCPs) since its release. Aim We aimed to evaluate the level of PCPs’ adoption of the RF-HT and the potential barriers of its use in family practice. Design and setting A cross-sectional study was conducted by a self-administered validated survey among all PCPs in Hong Kong through various means. Methods We assessed the level of and factors associated with its adoption by multivariate logistic regression modelling. Result A total of 3,857 invitation episodes were sent to 2,297 PCPs in 2014–2015. We received 383 completed questionnaires. The average score of adoption was 3.43 out of 4.00, and 47.5% of PCPs highly adopted RF-HT in their daily consultations. Male practitioners (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 0.524, 95% CI = 0.290–0.948, p = 0.033) and PCPs of public sector (aOR = 0.524, 95% CI = 0.292–0.940, p = 0.030) were significantly less likely to adopt the RF-HT. PCPs with higher training completion or being academic fellow are more likely to adopt RF-HT than those who were “nil to basic training completion” (aOR = 0.479, 95% CI = 0.269–0.853, p = 0.012) or “higher trainee” (aOR = 0.302, 95% CI = 0.093–0.979, p = 0.046). Three most-supported suggestions on RF-HT improvement were simplification of RF-HT, provision of pocket version and promoting in patients. Conclusion Among PCP respondents, the adoption level of the RF-HT was high. These findings also highlighted some factors associated with its adoption that could inform targeted interventions for enhancing its use in clinical practice."
https://openalex.org/W2897457702,"Hybrid vaccines have been investigated in clinical and experimental studies once expresses total antigens of a tumor cell combined with the ability of a dendritic cell (DC) to stimulate immune responses. However, the response triggered by these vaccines is often weak, requiring the use of adjuvants to increase vaccine immunogenicity. Killed Propionibacterium acnes (P. acnes) exerts immunomodulatory effects by increasing the phagocytic and tumoricidal activities of macrophages, promoting DC maturation, inducing pro-inflammatory cytokines production and increasing the humoral response to different antigens. Here, we evaluated the effect of P. acnes on a specific antitumor immune response elicited by a hybrid vaccine in a mouse melanoma model. Hybrid vaccine associated with P. acnes increased the absolute number of memory T cells, the IFN-γ secretion by these cells and the IgG-specific titers to B16F10 antigens, polarizing the immune response to a T helper 1 pattern. Furthermore, the addition of P. acnes to a hybrid vaccine increased the cytotoxic activity of splenocytes toward B16F10 in vitro and avoided late tumor progression in a pulmonary colonization model. These results revealed the adjuvant effect of a killed P. acnes suspension, as it improved specific humoral and cellular immune responses elicited by DC-tumor cell hybrid vaccines."
https://openalex.org/W2897484425,"Previous comparative research on the evolution of cognition has tested what we call the “altricial intelligence hypothesis”. This posits that a relationship between evolutionary changes in the altricial period length and cognition exists across animal species. However, the evidence available thus far either comes from indirect measurements of cognition or has not been conclusive. We performed a phylogenetic analysis of published data from various sources on 31 homeothermic species to test for an evolutionary association between the degree of altriciality and a direct measure of self-control. For each species, the degree of altriciality was determined based on the residual altricial period (i.e., the time from birth to fledging in birds and to weaning in mammals) on lifespan. The percentage of success in the cylinder task was the measure of self-control. Our results showed that the degree of altriciality covaried positively with the measure of self-control. Based on the results of this study, we sustain that evolutionary changes in the length of the altricial period are associated with evolutionary changes in the cognitive system used by homeotherms to perform the cylinder task."
