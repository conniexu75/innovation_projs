https://openalex.org/W3115667040,"Plasma membrane rupture (PMR) is the final cataclysmic event in lytic cell death. PMR releases intracellular molecules known as damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) that propagate the inflammatory response1–3. The underlying mechanism of PMR, however, is unknown. Here we show that the cell-surface NINJ1 protein4–8, which contains two transmembrane regions, has an essential role in the induction of PMR. A forward-genetic screen of randomly mutagenized mice linked NINJ1 to PMR. Ninj1−/− macrophages exhibited impaired PMR in response to diverse inducers of pyroptotic, necrotic and apoptotic cell death, and were unable to release numerous intracellular proteins including HMGB1 (a known DAMP) and LDH (a standard measure of PMR). Ninj1–/– macrophages died, but with a distinctive and persistent ballooned morphology, attributable to defective disintegration of bubble-like herniations. Ninj1–/– mice were more susceptible than wild-type mice to infection with Citrobacter rodentium, which suggests a role for PMR in anti-bacterial host defence. Mechanistically, NINJ1 used an evolutionarily conserved extracellular domain for oligomerization and subsequent PMR. The discovery of NINJ1 as a mediator of PMR overturns the long-held idea that cell death-related PMR is a passive event. The small transmembrane protein NINJ1 promotes plasma membrane rupture in lytic cell death associated with pyroptosis, necrosis and apoptosis."
https://openalex.org/W3121565687,"The water–gas shift (WGS) reaction is an industrially important source of pure hydrogen (H2) at the expense of carbon monoxide and water1,2. This reaction is of interest for fuel-cell applications, but requires WGS catalysts that are durable and highly active at low temperatures3. Here we demonstrate that the structure (Pt1–Ptn)/α-MoC, where isolated platinum atoms (Pt1) and subnanometre platinum clusters (Ptn) are stabilized on α-molybdenum carbide (α-MoC), catalyses the WGS reaction even at 313 kelvin, with a hydrogen-production pathway involving direct carbon monoxide dissociation identified. We find that it is critical to crowd the α-MoC surface with Pt1 and Ptn species, which prevents oxidation of the support that would cause catalyst deactivation, as seen with gold/α-MoC (ref. 4), and gives our system high stability and a high metal-normalized turnover number of 4,300,000 moles of hydrogen per mole of platinum. We anticipate that the strategy demonstrated here will be pivotal for the design of highly active and stable catalysts for effective activation of important molecules such as water and carbon monoxide for energy production. A stable, low-temperature water–gas shift catalyst is achieved by crowding platinum atoms and clusters on α-molybdenum carbide; the crowding protects the support from oxidation that would cause catalyst deactivation."
https://openalex.org/W3124792448,"The anatomy of the mammalian visual system, from the retina to the neocortex, is organized hierarchically1. However, direct observation of cellular-level functional interactions across this hierarchy is lacking due to the challenge of simultaneously recording activity across numerous regions. Here we describe a large, open dataset-part of the Allen Brain Observatory2-that surveys spiking from tens of thousands of units in six cortical and two thalamic regions in the brains of mice responding to a battery of visual stimuli. Using cross-correlation analysis, we reveal that the organization of inter-area functional connectivity during visual stimulation mirrors the anatomical hierarchy from the Allen Mouse Brain Connectivity Atlas3. We find that four classical hierarchical measures-response latency, receptive-field size, phase-locking to drifting gratings and response decay timescale-are all correlated with the hierarchy. Moreover, recordings obtained during a visual task reveal that the correlation between neural activity and behavioural choice also increases along the hierarchy. Our study provides a foundation for understanding coding and signal propagation across hierarchically organized cortical and thalamic visual areas."
https://openalex.org/W3122324184,"Ageing is characterized by the development of persistent pro-inflammatory responses that contribute to atherosclerosis, metabolic syndrome, cancer and frailty1–3. The ageing brain is also vulnerable to inflammation, as demonstrated by the high prevalence of age-associated cognitive decline and Alzheimer’s disease4–6. Systemically, circulating pro-inflammatory factors can promote cognitive decline7,8, and in the brain, microglia lose the ability to clear misfolded proteins that are associated with neurodegeneration9,10. However, the underlying mechanisms that initiate and sustain maladaptive inflammation with ageing are not well defined. Here we show that in ageing mice myeloid cell bioenergetics are suppressed in response to increased signalling by the lipid messenger prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), a major modulator of inflammation11. In ageing macrophages and microglia, PGE2 signalling through its EP2 receptor promotes the sequestration of glucose into glycogen, reducing glucose flux and mitochondrial respiration. This energy-deficient state, which drives maladaptive pro-inflammatory responses, is further augmented by a dependence of aged myeloid cells on glucose as a principal fuel source. In aged mice, inhibition of myeloid EP2 signalling rejuvenates cellular bioenergetics, systemic and brain inflammatory states, hippocampal synaptic plasticity and spatial memory. Moreover, blockade of peripheral myeloid EP2 signalling is sufficient to restore cognition in aged mice. Our study suggests that cognitive ageing is not a static or irrevocable condition but can be reversed by reprogramming myeloid glucose metabolism to restore youthful immune functions. In aged mice, inhibition of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) signalling through its receptor EP2 improves cellular bioenergetics, reduces inflammatory responses and restores hippocampal plasticity to youthful levels, resulting in an improvement in spatial memory and cognition."

https://openalex.org/W3124355643,"Lake ecosystems, and the organisms that live within them, are vulnerable to temperature change1-5, including the increased occurrence of thermal extremes6. However, very little is known about lake heatwaves-periods of extreme warm lake surface water temperature-and how they may change under global warming. Here we use satellite observations and a numerical model to investigate changes in lake heatwaves for hundreds of lakes worldwide from 1901 to 2099. We show that lake heatwaves will become hotter and longer by the end of the twenty-first century. For the high-greenhouse-gas-emission scenario (Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) 8.5), the average intensity of lake heatwaves, defined relative to the historical period (1970 to 1999), will increase from 3.7 ± 0.1 to 5.4 ± 0.8 degrees Celsius and their average duration will increase dramatically from 7.7 ± 0.4 to 95.5 ± 35.3 days. In the low-greenhouse-gas-emission RCP 2.6 scenario, heatwave intensity and duration will increase to 4.0 ± 0.2 degrees Celsius and 27.0 ± 7.6 days, respectively. Surface heatwaves are longer-lasting but less intense in deeper lakes (up to 60 metres deep) than in shallower lakes during both historic and future periods. As lakes warm during the twenty-first century7,8, their heatwaves will begin to extend across multiple seasons, with some lakes reaching a permanent heatwave state. Lake heatwaves are likely to exacerbate the adverse effects of long-term warming in lakes and exert widespread influence on their physical structure and chemical properties. Lake heatwaves could alter species composition by pushing aquatic species and ecosystems to the limits of their resilience. This in turn could threaten lake biodiversity9 and the key ecological and economic benefits that lakes provide to society."
https://openalex.org/W3125218820,"Most natural and artificial materials have crystalline structures from which abundant topological phases emerge [1-6]. The bulk-edge correspondence, widely-adopted in experiments to determine the band topology from edge properties, however, becomes inadequate in discerning various topological crystalline phases [7-17], leading to great challenges in the experimental classification of the large family of topological crystalline materials [4-6]. Theories predict that disclinations, ubiquitous crystallographic defects, provide an effective probe of crystalline topology beyond edges [18-21], which, however, has not yet been confirmed in experiments. Here, we report the experimental discovery of the bulk-disclination correspondence which is manifested as the fractional spectral charge and robust bound states at the disclinations. The fractional disclination charge originates from the symmetry-protected bulk charge patterns---a fundamental property of many topological crystalline insulators (TCIs). Meanwhile, the robust bound states at disclinations emerge as a secondary, but directly observable property of TCIs. Using reconfigurable photonic crystals as photonic TCIs with higher-order topology, we observe those hallmark features via pump-probe and near-field detection measurements. Both the fractional charge and the localized states are demonstrated to emerge at the disclination in the TCI phase but vanish in the trivial phase. The experimental discovery of bulk-disclination correspondence unveils a novel fundamental phenomenon and a new paradigm for exploring topological materials."

https://openalex.org/W3125348427,"The cortex projects to the dorsal striatum topographically1,2 to regulate behaviour3-5, but spiking activity in the two structures has previously been reported to have markedly different relations to sensorimotor events6-9. Here we show that the relationship between activity in the cortex and striatum is spatiotemporally precise, topographic, causal and invariant to behaviour. We simultaneously recorded activity across large regions of the cortex and across the width of the dorsal striatum in mice that performed a visually guided task. Striatal activity followed a mediolateral gradient in which behavioural correlates progressed from visual cue to response movement to reward licking. The summed activity in each part of the striatum closely and specifically mirrored activity in topographically associated cortical regions, regardless of task engagement. This relationship held for medium spiny neurons and fast-spiking interneurons, whereas the activity of tonically active neurons differed from cortical activity with stereotypical responses to sensory or reward events. Inactivation of the visual cortex abolished striatal responses to visual stimuli, supporting a causal role of cortical inputs in driving the striatum. Striatal visual responses were larger in trained mice than untrained mice, with no corresponding change in overall activity in the visual cortex. Striatal activity therefore reflects a consistent, causal and scalable topographical mapping of cortical activity."

https://openalex.org/W3123053946,"In dynamic environments, subjects often integrate multiple samples of a signal and combine them to reach a categorical judgment1. The process of deliberation can be described by a time-varying decision variable (DV), decoded from neural population activity, that predicts a subject's upcoming decision2. Within single trials, however, there are large moment-to-moment fluctuations in the DV, the behavioural significance of which is unclear. Here, using real-time, neural feedback control of stimulus duration, we show that within-trial DV fluctuations, decoded from motor cortex, are tightly linked to decision state in macaques, predicting behavioural choices substantially better than the condition-averaged DV or the visual stimulus alone. Furthermore, robust changes in DV sign have the statistical regularities expected from behavioural studies of changes of mind3. Probing the decision process on single trials with weak stimulus pulses, we find evidence for time-varying absorbing decision bounds, enabling us to distinguish between specific models of decision making."
https://openalex.org/W3121294329,"A growing body of literature suggests that restrictive public health measures implemented to control COVID-19 have had negative impacts on physical activity. We examined how Stay Home orders in Houston, New York City, and Seattle impacted outdoor physical activity patterns, measured by daily bicycle and pedestrian count data. We assessed changes in activity levels between the period before and during Stay Home orders. Across all three cities, we found significant changes in bicycle and pedestrian counts from the period before to the period during Stay Home orders. The direction of change varied by location, likely due to differing local contexts and outbreak progression. These results can inform policy around the use of outdoor public infrastructure as the COVID-19 pandemic continues."
https://openalex.org/W3121987111,"Fast synaptic transmission relies upon the activation of ionotropic receptors by neurotransmitter release to evoke postsynaptic potentials. Glutamate and GABA play dominant roles in driving highly dynamic activity in synaptically connected neuronal circuits, but ionotropic receptors for other neurotransmitters are also expressed in the neocortex, including nicotinic receptors, which are non-selective cation channels gated by acetylcholine. To study the function of non-glutamatergic excitation in neocortex, we used two-photon microscopy to target whole-cell membrane potential recordings to different types of genetically defined neurons in layer 2/3 of primary somatosensory barrel cortex in awake head-restrained mice combined with pharmacological and optogenetic manipulations. Here, we report a prominent nicotinic input, which selectively depolarizes a subtype of GABAergic neuron expressing vasoactive intestinal peptide leading to disinhibition during active sensorimotor processing. Nicotinic disinhibition of somatosensory cortex during active sensing might contribute importantly to integration of top-down and motor-related signals necessary for tactile perception and learning."
https://openalex.org/W3122703423,"Break-induced replication (BIR) repairs one-ended double-strand breaks in DNA similar to those formed by replication collapse or telomere erosion, and it has been implicated in the initiation of genome instability in cancer and other human diseases1,2. Previous studies have defined the enzymes that are required for BIR1-5; however, understanding of initial and extended BIR synthesis, and of how the migrating D-loop proceeds through known replication roadblocks, has been precluded by technical limitations. Here we use a newly developed assay to show that BIR synthesis initiates soon after strand invasion and proceeds more slowly than S-phase replication. Without primase, leading strand synthesis is initiated efficiently, but is unable to proceed beyond 30 kilobases, suggesting that primase is needed for stabilization of the nascent leading strand. DNA synthesis can initiate in the absence of Pif1 or Pol32, but does not proceed efficiently. Interstitial telomeric DNA disrupts and terminates BIR progression, and BIR initiation is suppressed by transcription proportionally to the transcription level. Collisions between BIR and transcription lead to mutagenesis and chromosome rearrangements at levels that exceed instabilities induced by transcription during normal replication. Together, these results provide fundamental insights into the mechanism of BIR and how BIR contributes to genome instability."

Microtubule-associated protein Tau is implicated in numerous neurodegenerative disorders (“tauopathies”), including Alzheimer’s disease and traumatic brain injury (Ballatore et al., 2007Ballatore C.

Tau pathology is observed when the protein causes havoc and aggregates in neurons, and this closely correlates with cognitive decline across these diseases (Arriagada et al., 1992Arriagada P.V.

However, the underlying mechanisms that lead to cognitive decline are not fully understood. When expressed in animal models, mutant human Tau induces cell-non-autonomous neuroinflammation, including microglial and astroglial activation (Bellucci et al., 2004Bellucci A. Westwood A.J.

Similarly, reactive microglia are upregulated in frontotemporal dementia patients carrying a mutation in Tau (Bellucci et al., 2011Bellucci A. Bugiani O. Ghetti B. Spillantini M.G.

These data indicate that pathogenic Tau induces glial activation (Nilson et al., 2017Nilson A.N. English K.C. Gerson J.E. Barton Whittle T. Nicolas Crain C. Xue J. Sengupta U. Castillo-Carranza D.L.

What is not yet clear is whether activated glial cells and synaptic degeneration are causally linked, and which of these Tau-induced defects are relevant for cognitive decline. Tau protein is expressed in neurons and under physiological conditions binds to axonal microtubules (Binder et al., 1985Binder L.I. Frankfurter A. Rebhun L.I.

Komanduri C. Wooten K. Chen M. Thaller C. Janz R. Characterization of synaptogyrin 3 as a new synaptic vesicle protein.J. Comp. Neurol. 2004; 470: 266-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Given that Synaptogyrin-3 is uniquely present at pre-synaptic terminals, this allows us to decipher the contribution of pre-synaptic Tau to overall Tau-induced pathology. Here we show that heterozygous knockout of synaptogyrin-3 in pathogenic Tau-expressing mice rescues Tau-induced long-term plasticity defects and (pre- and post-) synaptic loss, but not neuroinflammation. Intriguingly, we also find that the loss of synaptogyrin-3 rescues Tau-induced decline of working memory, and this despite upregulated activated glial cells. Hence our results indicate that Tau induces neuroinflammation and synaptic loss independently, and that synaptic degeneration is a major determinant of cognitive decline. We generated a synaptogyrin-3 knockout mouse line targeting the second exon of the endogenous gene using CRISPR-Cas9 technology (Figure S1A). Synaptogyrin-3 knockout mice are viable and fertile and are born in the expected Mendelian inheritance ratios. We validated the efficiency of the knockout with two antibodies that recognize the C- and N-terminal domains of Synaptogyrin-3 protein (Figure S1B). Synaptogyrin-3 protein is not detected in synaptogyrin-3−/− mouse brain homogenates, and the expression levels are reduced by half in synaptogyrin-3+/− mice (Figure S1C). The levels of other synaptic proteins, including the other neuronally expressed Synaptogyrin, Synaptogyrin-1, are not significantly different from littermate controls (Figures S1D–S1G). Neither synaptogyrin-3+/− nor synaptogyrin-3−/− mice exhibit obvious visible phenotypes, and they are indistinguishable from their wild-type littermates in terms of overall appearance (Figure S1H), body weight (Figure S1I), motor performance (Figure S1J), and lifespan (Figure S1K). Hence partial or complete loss of Synaptogyrin-3 seems to be well tolerated in mice over their lifespan. We next assessed the immunohistochemical localization of Synaptogyrin-3 in mouse coronal brain sections. We find Synaptogyrin-3 expression across multiple brain regions, including the hippocampus (Figure 1A). The localization pattern that we observe is specific to Synaptogyrin-3 (and does not correspond to Synaptogyrin-1) because we do not detect labeling in synaptogyrin-3−/− mice (Figure 1A). Interestingly, when comparing the expression pattern of Synaptogyrin-3 and -1, we detect a strong enrichment of Synaptogyrin-3, compared with Synaptogyrin-1, at the stratum lucidum (Figures 1B and 1C). The stratum lucidum contains synaptic contacts of dentate gyrus granule cells that send their axons (mossy fibers) to CA3 pyramidal neurons. The mossy fiber-CA3 synapses comprise large pre-synaptic terminals and are critically important for working memory, being altered at early stages of Tau-associated pathology in Alzheimer’s disease patients and mouse models (Viana da Silva et al., 2019Viana da Silva S. Zhang P. Haberl M.G. Labrousse V. Grosjean N. Blanchet C. Frick A. Mulle C. Hippocampal mossy fibers synapses in CA3 pyramidal cells are altered at an early stage in a mouse model of Alzheimer’s disease.J. Neurosci. 2019; 39: 4193-4205Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Under pathogenic conditions, Synaptogyrin-3 serves as a receptor for Tau at pre-synaptic terminals (McInnes et al., 2018McInnes J. Wierda K. Snellinx A. Bounti L. Wang Y.-C. Stancu I.-C. Apóstolo N.

We therefore assessed where the two proteins localize in mice expressing pathogenic Tau (Tau P301S or “PS19 mouse line”). We find strong accumulation of Tau in the stratum lucidum in 6-month-old Tau P301S mice when compared with wild-type littermates, whereas the levels of Tau at other hippocampal layers seem to be similar (Figures 1D and 1E). We observe strong co-labeling of Tau and the pre-synaptic proteins Synaptogyrin-3 and Synaptoporin in the stratum lucidum (Figures 1F and 1G), suggesting pre-synaptic accumulation of Tau in mossy fiber-CA3 synapses at this stage. To verify that pathogenic Tau localizes to Synaptogyrin-3-positive mossy fiber-CA3 synapses, we isolated these synapses (Apóstolo et al., 2020Apóstolo N. Smukowski S.N. Vanderlinden J. Condomitti G. Rybakin V. Ten Bos J. Trobiani L. Portegies S. Vennekens K.M. Gounko N.V. et al.Synapse type-specific proteomic dissection identifies IgSF8 as a hippocampal CA3 microcircuit organizer.Nat. Commun. 2020; 11: 5171Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar) from wild-type and Tau P301S mice and labeled them using specific markers. The majority of mossy fiber-CA3 synaptosomes from both wild-type and Tau P301S mice are positive for Synaptoporin and Synaptogyrin-3 (Figure 1H), but only the ones from Tau P301S mice are positive for Tau (Figure 1I). A strong co-localization between Tau and the pre-synaptic proteins Synaptoporin and Synaptogyrin-3 is found in mossy fiber synaptosomes from Tau P301S mice (Figure 1J). Together, these data further confirm that Synaptogyrin-3 and pathogenic Tau are present in the pre-synaptic terminals of mossy fiber-CA3 synapses in 6-month-old Tau P301S mice. Next, we asked if the synaptic-localized Tau associates with vesicles in this model, similar to what we observed in fruit flies and Alzheimer’s disease patient brain samples (McInnes et al., 2018McInnes J. Wierda K. Snellinx A. Bounti L. Wang Y.-C. Stancu I.-C. Apóstolo N. Gevaert K. Dewachter I. Spires-Jones T.L. et al.Synaptogyrin-3 Mediates Presynaptic Dysfunction Induced by Tau.Neuron. 2018; 97: 823-835.e8Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar; Zhou et al., 2017Zhou L. McInnes J. Wierda K. Holt M. Herrmann A.G. Jackson R.J. Wang Y.-C. Swerts J. Beyens J. Miskiewicz K. et al.Tau association with synaptic vesicles causes presynaptic dysfunction.Nat. Commun. 2017; 8: 15295Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). We confirm, by western blotting, that Tau and Synaptogyrin-3 are present in the synaptic vesicle fraction purified from Tau P301S mice, and that there is much less Tau in the synaptic vesicle fraction isolated from wild-type littermates (Figure 1K). This difference is not merely because Tau is overexpressed: consistent with previous reports, Tau protein levels are ~5-fold increased in total Tau P301S mouse brain homogenates compared with wild-type mice (Figures 1K and 1L). However, Tau protein levels are ~13-fold increased in the synaptic vesicle fraction from Tau P301S mice compared with wild-type littermates (Figures 1K and 1L). Hence there is significantly more Tau segregating with the synaptic vesicle fraction in Tau P301S mice than the amount of Tau that is overexpressed, consistent with the association of Tau with synaptic vesicles in this model. Finally, we also tested if Tau and Synaptogyrin-3 co-localize at pre-synaptic terminals in Alzheimer’s disease patient brains. We performed array tomography on post-mortem middle/inferior temporal cortical sections (Brodmann area 20/21) from five Braak stage VI Alzheimer’s disease patients and five age-matched healthy controls and immunolabeled them using antibodies raised against Synaptogyrin-3, Synapsin-1 (as a general presynaptic marker), and Tau (AF3494 antibody) (Figure S1L). We find over 33-fold more Synaptogyrin-3-positive puncta that are also positive for Synapsin-1 and Tau in the brain samples from Alzheimer’s disease patients compared with healthy control brain samples (2.33% versus 0.07%; Figure S1M). These data indicate that Tau shows increased co-localization with Synaptogyrin-3 at pre-synaptic terminals in the brains of Alzheimer’s disease patients compared with healthy controls. We previously showed that Synaptogyrin-3 mediates pathogenic Tau-induced synaptic dysfunction in vitro (McInnes et al., 2018McInnes J. Wierda K. Snellinx A. Bounti L. Wang Y.-C. Stancu I.-C. Apóstolo N. Gevaert K. Dewachter I. Spires-Jones T.L. et al.Synaptogyrin-3 Mediates Presynaptic Dysfunction Induced by Tau.Neuron. 2018; 97: 823-835.e8Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Here we show that Tau and Synaptogyrin-3 are enriched at mossy fiber-CA3 synapses of Tau P301S mice (Figure 1). We therefore hypothesized that lowering Synaptogyrin-3 expression in Tau P301S mice would ameliorate pathogenic Tau-induced phenotypes associated with these synapses. We bred Tau P301S mice with synaptogyrin3+/− mice and aged the offspring (Figure S2A). We verified that Synaptogyrin-3 protein expression is ~50% lower in Tau P301S; synaptogyrin-3+/− mice compared with Tau P301S littermates (Figures S2B and S2C). We also verified that Tau protein expression levels in Tau P301S; synaptogyrin-3+/− and Tau P301S littermates are similar (Figures S2B and S2C). We then evaluated the contribution of pathogenic Tau to the synaptic function of mossy fiber-CA3 synapses by assessing the electrophysiological properties of these synapses in acute hippocampal slices of 6- to 7-month-old Tau P301S mice (Figure 2A). We verified that the recordings belong to mossy fiber-CA3 synapses by application of DCG-IV (Figure 2A), a group II metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs) agonist that selectively depresses mossy fiber transmission (Nicoll and Schmitz, 2005Nicoll R.A. Schmitz D. Synaptic plasticity at hippocampal mossy fibre synapses.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2005; 6: 863-876Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar). When we apply incremental single stimulations to mossy fibers, we find that the post-synaptic potentials at the stratum lucidum of Tau P301S and wild-type littermate controls are indistinguishable (Figure S2D), indicating general excitability is not affected. Next, we applied paired-pulse stimulations and find the ratios of the amplitudes of the responses in Tau P301S mice and wild-type controls to be similar (Figure S2E). This indicates that pathogenic Tau does not affect short-term plasticity of mossy fiber-CA3 synapses at early stages of pathology. Hence pathogenic Tau does not affect the basic synaptic transmission characteristics of mossy fiber-CA3 synapses. Next, we measured long-term plasticity and applied a three-theta-burst-stimulation (TBS) paradigm to the mossy fibers to induce long-term potentiation (LTP). When compared with wild-type controls, we find that expression of pathogenic Tau limits the induction and maintenance of LTP (Figure 2B). Given that LTP is mostly determined by pre-synaptic components in mossy fiber-CA3 synapses (Nicoll and Schmitz, 2005Nicoll R.A. Schmitz D. Synaptic plasticity at hippocampal mossy fibre synapses.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2005; 6: 863-876Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar), we hypothesize that reduction of Synaptogyrin-3 levels can ameliorate this Tau-induced LTP defect. We recorded LTP of mossy fiber-CA3 synapses in 6- to 7-month-old Tau P301S; synaptogyrin-3+/− mice and find a response similar to that of their wild-type littermates and higher than that of Tau P301S mice (Figures 2B–2E). Reduction of Synaptogyrin-3 in wild-type animals does not have an effect on the LTP response, because LTP recordings from synaptogyrin-3+/− mice are comparable with those from wild-type littermates (Figures 2B–2E). Thus, reduction of Synaptogyrin-3 levels corrects long-term plasticity defects induced by pathogenic Tau at mossy fiber-CA3 synapses. We also tested if lowering Synaptogyrin-3 expression affects Tau-induced defects at other synapses, and recorded LTP of Schaffer collateral-CA1 synapses (Figure S2F). Whereas LTP of mossy fiber-CA3 synapses originates from pre-synaptic mechanisms, LTP of Schaffer collateral-CA1 synapses is induced by post-synaptic NMDAR signaling and expressed by increased AMPAR activity (Lledo et al., 1998Lledo P.M. Zhang X. Südhof T.C. Malenka R.C. Nicoll R.A. Postsynaptic membrane fusion and long-term potentiation.Science. 1998; 279: 399-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar; Lüscher et al., 1999Lüscher C. Xia H. Beattie E.C.

Role of AMPA receptor cycling in synaptic transmission and plasticity.Neuron. 1999; 24: 649-658Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (576) Google Scholar). When we record LTP of Schaffer collateral-CA1 synapses on 6- to 7-month-old mice, we find no differences between wild-type and Tau P301S (Figure S2G). This is likely explained because at this age, the accumulation of Tau in Tau P301S mice is mostly restricted to the CA3 stratum lucidum (Figure 1D). However, when we record LTP in 8-month-old Tau P301S mice, an age at which Tau accumulation is already extended toward the CA1 hippocampal region, we find that LTP of Schaffer collateral-CA1 synapses is severely impaired. Interestingly, removing the expression of one copy of synaptogyrin-3 (Tau P301S; synaptogyrin-3+/−) rescues this defect (Figures S2H–S2K). These findings suggest that the positive effect of reducing Synaptogyrin-3 levels is not restricted to synapses with a strong pre-synaptic component like mossy fiber-CA3 synapses, but that the same applies to other synapses, like Schaffer collateral-CA1 synapses. Long-term synaptic plasticity underlies mechanisms of learning and memory. We therefore assessed learning and memory capacity of Tau P301S and wild-type mice in two different versions of the Morris water maze (MWM) test, reflecting separate aspects of cognition. A classic MWM protocol where the platform location does not change assesses spatial reference memory that is largely under control of CA1 pyramidal neurons or “place cells” (Morris et al., 1982Morris R.G.M. Garrud P. Rawlins J.N.P. O’Keefe J. Place navigation impaired in rats with hippocampal lesions.Nature. 1982; 297: 681-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (4846) Google Scholar). An alternative MWM paradigm evaluates working memory, for which CA3 pyramidal neurons are essential (Nakazawa et al., 2003Nakazawa K. Sun L.D. Quirk M.C. Rondi-Reig L. Wilson M.A. Tonegawa S. Hippocampal CA3 NMDA receptors are crucial for memory acquisition of one-time experience.Neuron. 2003; 38: 305-315Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar). In this paradigm, the location of the platform remains constant for only a single day but changes between days, thus representing a higher cognitive challenge for the mice (see STAR Methods for details). In mice that are 6–7 months old, a stage at which Schaffer collateral-CA1 LTP is not yet affected (Figure S2G), we do not find a significant difference in the spatial reference memory test between Tau P301S mice and littermate controls (Figures S3A–S3C). However, in the working memory test, 6- to 7-month-old Tau P301S mice perform worse than their wild-type littermates: they fail to significantly reduce the path length needed to find the platform over consecutive swims (Figure S3D). These results are in line with impaired LTP of mossy fiber-CA3 synapses at this stage in Tau P301S mice (Figure 2). We verified that the defect in working memory is not influenced by sex (Figure S3E). We also verified that the working memory defect in Tau P301S mice is not of developmental origin because 3- to 4-month-old Tau P301S mice do improve their performance over consecutive swims (Figure S3F). Given that reduction of Synaptogyrin-3 corrects pathogenic Tau-induced defects in LTP of mossy fiber-CA3 synapses, we next asked whether this also corrects the working memory defect in 6- to 7-month-old Tau P301S mice. Tau P301S; synaptogyrin-3+/− mice perform as well as wild-type mice, and they are more efficient than Tau P301S mice in adapting to the novel spatial locations, as evidenced by statistically significant reduction of path lengths and time (latency) needed to find the platform (Figure 3). Hence working memory defects are directly induced by pre-synaptic pathogenic Tau and are dependent on the presence of the pre-synaptic protein Synaptogyrin-3. A common feature in patients suffering from tauopathies and in mice expressing pathogenic Tau is the loss of synapses, especially in the hippocampus (Spires-Jones and Hyman, 2014Spires-Jones T.L. Hyman B.T. The intersection of amyloid beta and tau at synapses in Alzheimer’s disease.Neuron. 2014; 82: 756-771Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar). We evaluated the total area occupied by mossy fiber-CA3 synapses in Tau P301S mice using immunohistochemistry. We labeled mossy fiber-CA3 synapses of 8- to 9-month-old mice with two different pre- and post-synaptic stratum lucidum markers, Synaptoporin and Synapsin-3 (both pre-synaptic markers), as well as GluK5 and Nectin-3 (both enriched post-synaptically), and find all these markers to be reduced in Tau P301S mice compared with wild-type littermates (Figures 4A and S4A). We then tested if lowering Synaptogyrin-3 levels is sufficient to prevent this defect. We find that the synaptic stratum lucidum area in Tau P301S; synaptogyrin-3+/− mice is similar to wild-type littermates (Figures 4B and S4B). Consistently, in western blots of hippocampal homogenates, we also observe that the protein levels of Synapsin-3 and GluK5 are lower in Tau P301S mice but similar to wild-type controls in Tau P301S; synaptogyrin-3+/− mice (Figures S4C and S4D). This rescue of synaptic integrity is not because Tau expression is altered in Tau P301S; synaptogyrin-3+/− mice, because the stratum lucidum area in these animals is labeled by Tau (Figure S4E). Together, these data indicate that the synaptic loss induced by mutant Tau is rescued by lowering Synaptogyrin-3 expression. To further corroborate our observations, we also performed transmission electron microscopy visualizing mossy fiber-CA3 synapses in wild-type, synaptogyrin-3+/−, Tau P301S, and Tau P301S; synaptogyrin-3+/− mice (Figure 4C). Mossy fiber-CA3 synapses are easily identified by their large pre-synaptic boutons and because they have a high density of synaptic vesicles. We quantified the number of mossy fiber boutons in standard-sized images and find their number is reduced in Tau P301S mice. In contrast, Tau P301S; synaptogyrin-3+/− show a number of mossy fiber"

We conducted comparative analysis of publicly available whole-genome sequences of 64 SARS-CoV-2 isolates in Bangladesh and 371 isolates from another 27 countries to predict possible transmission routes of COVID19 to Bangladesh and genomic variations among the viruses. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that the pathogen was imported in Bangladesh from multiple countries. The viruses found in the southern district of Chattogram were closely related to strains from Saudi Arabia whereas those in Dhaka were similar to that of United Kingdom and France. The 64 SARS-CoV-2 sequences from Bangladesh belonged to three clusters. Compared to the ancestral SARS-CoV-2 sequence reported from China, the isolates in Bangladesh had a total of 180 mutations in the coding region of the genome, and 110 of these were missense. Among these, 99 missense mutations (90%) were predicted to destabilize protein structures. Remarkably, a mutation that leads to an I300F change in the nsp2 protein and a mutation leading to D614G change in the spike protein were prevalent in SARS-CoV-2 genomic sequences, and might have influenced the epidemiological properties of the virus in Bangladesh."
https://openalex.org/W3123158283,"Active forgetting is an essential component of the memory management system of the brain1. Forgetting can be permanent, in which prior memory is lost completely, or transient, in which memory exists in a temporary state of impaired retrieval. Temporary blocks on memory seem to be universal, and can disrupt an individual's plans, social interactions and ability to make rapid, flexible and appropriate choices. However, the neurobiological mechanisms that cause transient forgetting are unknown. Here we identify a single dopamine neuron in Drosophila that mediates the memory suppression that results in transient forgetting. Artificially activating this neuron did not abolish the expression of long-term memory. Instead, it briefly suppressed memory retrieval, with the memory becoming accessible again over time. The dopamine neuron modulates memory retrieval by stimulating a unique dopamine receptor that is expressed in a restricted physical compartment of the axons of mushroom body neurons. This mechanism for transient forgetting is triggered by the presentation of interfering stimuli immediately before retrieval."
https://openalex.org/W3122570460,"Type 2 immunity plays an essential role in the maintenance of metabolic homeostasis and its disruption during obesity promotes meta-inflammation and insulin resistance. Infection with the helminth parasite Schistosoma mansoni and treatment with its soluble egg antigens (SEA) induce a type 2 immune response in metabolic organs and improve insulin sensitivity and glucose tolerance in obese mice, yet, a causal relationship remains unproven. Here, we investigated the effects and underlying mechanisms of the T2 ribonuclease omega-1 (ω1), one of the major S mansoni immunomodulatory glycoproteins, on metabolic homeostasis. We show that treatment of obese mice with plant-produced recombinant ω1, harboring similar glycan motifs as present on the native molecule, decreased body fat mass, and improved systemic insulin sensitivity and glucose tolerance in a time- and dose-dependent manner. This effect was associated with an increase in white adipose tissue (WAT) type 2 T helper cells, eosinophils, and alternatively activated macrophages, without affecting type 2 innate lymphoid cells. In contrast to SEA, the metabolic effects of ω1 were still observed in obese STAT6-deficient mice with impaired type 2 immunity, indicating that its metabolic effects are independent of the type 2 immune response. Instead, we found that ω1 inhibited food intake, without affecting locomotor activity, WAT thermogenic capacity or whole-body energy expenditure, an effect also occurring in leptin receptor-deficient obese and hyperphagic db/db mice. Altogether, we demonstrate that while the helminth glycoprotein ω1 can induce type 2 immunity, it improves whole-body metabolic homeostasis in obese mice by inhibiting food intake via a STAT6-independent mechanism."

https://openalex.org/W3122396709,"Background Stunting at birth is a chronic form of undernutrition majorly attributable to poor prenatal nutrition, which could persist in children’s later life and impact their physical and cognitive health. Although multiple studies have been conducted in Ethiopia to show the magnitude of stunting and factors, all are concentrated on children aged between 6 to 59 months. Therefore, this study was done to determine the prevalence and associated factors of stunting at birth among newborns delivered at the University of Gondar Comprehensive Specialized Referral Hospital, Northwest, Ethiopia. Methods An institution-based cross-sectional study was conducted from February 26 th to April 25 th/ 2020. A systematic random sampling technique was used, to select a total of 422 newborn-mother pairs. The binary logistic regression was employed to identify factors associated with stunting and all independent variables were entered into the multivariable logistic regression model to adjust for confounders. Variables that had significant association were identified based on p-value &lt; 0.05 and the adjusted odds ratio with its respective 95% confidence interval was applied to determine the strength as well as the direction of the association. Results About 30.5% (95% CI: 26.3%, 35.1%) of newborns were stunted at birth. Being male [Adjusted odds ratio (AOR) = 2.9(1.62, 5.21)], newborns conceived in Kiremt(rainy season) [AOR = 2.7(1.49, 4.97)], being low birth weight [AOR = 3.1(1.64, 6.06)] were factors associated with stunting at birth. Likewise, newborns born to short stature mothers [AOR = 2.8(1.21, 6.62)] and chronically malnourished mothers [AOR = 15.3(8.12, 29.1)] were at greater risk of being stunted. Conclusion Just under a third of newborns are stunted at birth, implying a pressing public health problem. Newborns born to chronically malnourished and short stature mothers were more stunted. Besides, stunting was prevalently observed among male neonates, newborns conceived in Kiremet, and being low birth weight. Thus, policymakers and nutrition programmers should work on preventing maternal undernutrition through nutrition education to reduce the burden of low birth weight and stunting. Further, paying due attention to newborns conceived in Kiremet season to improve nutritional status is recommended."

This observational retrospective epidemiological study aimed to estimate the proportion of patients with TRD within a cohort of patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) in Hungary and examine the mortality and comorbidities of patients with and without TRD. Patients and methods This study included patients with MDD who experienced onset of a new depressive episode between 01 January 2009 and 31 August 2015, using data from a nationwide, longitudinal database. Results Overall, 99,531 patients were included in the MDD cohort, of which 8,268 (8.3%) also met the criteria for TRD. The overall survival of non-TRD patients was longer than in TRD patients; the risk of mortality for TRD patients was significantly higher than of non-TRD patients (HR [CI] 1.381 [1.212–1.571]; p&lt;0.001). Patients with TRD had a significantly higher probability of having “Neurotic, stress-related and somatoform disordersˮ, autoimmune conditions, cardio- or cerebrovascular diseases, thyroid gland diseases and self-harming behaviour not resulting in death than non-TRD patients (for all comparisons, p values were less than 0.005). Discussion To our best knowledge, this is the first study to assess the frequency of TRD in Hungary. In a cohort of Hungarian MDD patients, we have found that the proportion of TRD (~8.3%) is comparable to those reported in previous studies with similar methodology from other countries. The majority of our other main findings (e.g. more frequent self-harming behaviour, increased risk of “Neurotic, stress-related and somatoform disordersˮ and higher overall mortality in TRD subjects) are also in line with previous results from other countries. Taking the substantial proportion of patients with TRD into consideration, a more comprehensive and targeted treatment strategy would be required for these individuals."

Here, we investigated the action and mechanism of a natural polymethoxyflavone on adaptive thermogenesis in high-fat diet-induced obesity mouse model. Nobiletin treatment significantly ameliorated obesity, alleviated the whitening of brown adipose tissue, and promoted browning of white adipose tissue in mice fed a high-fat diet. Gut microbiota analysis and metabolomic profiling revealed that nobiletin treatment resulted in a composition shift in the gut microbiota thereby altering fermentation products acetate levels in the host feces and serum. Further, transplantation of the microbiota from nobiletin-treated mice to microbiota-depleted mice activated brown adipose tissue activity, promoted beige adipocytes formation, and improved high-fat diet-induced obesity. Our results indicate that nobiletin could be used as a dietary therapy to prevent HFD-induced obesity, and provide a potential target-specific gut microbial species-driven mechanism for activating thermogenesis in brown and beige adipocytes."
https://openalex.org/W3121733167,"Anticipatory behaviour occurs in the period before a reward or other positive event is presented and has been interpreted as an indicator of the welfare and emotional state of animals. The use of this indicator has received limited attention in dairy calves. Therefore, we investigated how anticipatory behaviour is affected by housing environment and reward quality, and if anticipatory behaviour changes when reward quality changes unexpectedly. Sixteen pairs of calves were assigned to treatments in a 2 x 2 factorial design (two housing environment and two reward quality combinations). Housing was either basic (2 m 2 /calf, river stone surface) or enriched (5 m 2 /calf, woodchip, and enrichment items), and the reward was access to either an additional basic or enriched pen. Calves were conditioned to anticipate reward pen access; anticipatory behaviour toward receiving the reward pen was measured. Signaling reward access increased the frequency of transitions between behaviours and duration of touching and looking at the signal and exit door. Basic-housed calves showed more anticipatory behaviour (increased frequency of transitions between behaviours) and decreased latency to access the reward compared to enriched-housed calves, but the reward pen quality had no effect on anticipatory behaviour. When the reward pen quality changed from enriched to basic unexpectedly, resulting in sudden reward loss, basic-housed calves decreased, while enriched-housed calves increased, anticipatory behaviour. However, there was no change in anticipatory behaviour during reward gain (change from basic to enriched reward pen). Our findings align with previous work showing that animals in basic housing show more anticipation for a reward, and demonstrate suppressed behavioural response when experiencing reward loss, suggesting greater sensitivity to reward. Sensitivity to reward has associations with mood state; thus, calves in basic environments may experience a more negative emotional state, and thus reduced welfare, compared to calves in enriched environments."

https://openalex.org/W3125725740,"Fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23) is a main regulator of mineral homeostasis. Low and high circulating FGF23 levels are associated with bone, renal, cardiovascular diseases, and increased mortality. Understanding the factors and signaling pathways affecting FGF23 levels is crucial for the management of these diseases and their complications. Here, we show that activation of the Jak1/Stat3 signaling pathway leads to inflammation in liver and to an increase in hepatic FGF23 synthesis, a key hormone in mineral metabolism. This increased synthesis leads to massive C-terminal FGF23 circulating levels, the inactive C-terminal fragment, and increased intact FGF23 levels, the active form, resulting in imbalanced production and cleavage. Liver inflammation does not lead to activation of the calcineurin-NFAT pathway, and no signs of systemic inflammation could be observed. Despite the increase of active intact FGF23, excessive C-terminal FGF23 levels block the phosphaturic activity of FGF23. Therefore, kidney function and renal αKlotho expression are normal and no activation of the MAPK pathway was detected. In addition, activation of the Jak1/Stat3 signaling pathway leads to high calcitriol levels and low parathyroid hormone production. Thus, JAK1 is a central regulator of mineral homeostasis. Moreover, this study also shows that in order to assess the impact of high FGF23 levels on disease and kidney function, the source and the balance in FGF23 production and cleavage are critical."
https://openalex.org/W3123679492,"Background Uremic pruritus (UP) is a common and frustrating symptom in patients receiving hemodialysis (HD). The majority of patients have mild to moderate itching of the skin, and a small percentage have severe itching, which seriously affects their quality of life and survival rate. However, little is known about factors that influence the intensity of itching in patients. Methods A cross-sectional study on uremic pruritus in male and female patients receiving HD was conducted in September 2019. This study included 148 eligible patients who received HD at the Blood Purification Center of Xinchang County People’s Hospital, Zhejiang Province, China from March 2019 to June 2019. We collected general data consisted of age, sex, body mass index (BMI), place of residence, educational level, diabetes mellitus status and duration of HD; as well as clinical, biochemical indicators, including serum calcium (Ca), serum phosphorus (P), serum albumin (ALB), haemoglobin (Hb), serum intact parathyroid hormone (iPTH), pre-dialysis serum urea nitrogen (BUN), normalized protein catabolic rate (nPCR), urea nitrogen clearance index (KT/V), ferritin (FER) and pre-dialysis serum creatinine (sCR). We also assayed the inflammatory cytokine serum high sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP). The Five-Dimensional Itching Scale (5DIS) was used to evaluate the degree of skin itching (none, mild, moderate, or severe). We used multiple logistic regression to analyze influencing factors on the degree of skin itching in patients with UP. Results Of the 148 patients, 60 had uremic pruritus (incidence rate, 40.54%). These included 22 cases of mild skin itching (14.86%), 30 of moderate skin itching (20.27%), and 8 of severe skin itching (5.41%). Compared with uremia patients without skin pruritus, patients with UP had higher levels of iPTH, Hb, BUN, nPCR, and hs-CRP. The composition ratio showed significant differences between urban and rural patients with different degrees of skin itching ( P = 0.017); moreover, the difference of iPTH and hs-CRP levels were statistically significant ( P = 0.009 and &lt; 0.001, respectively). Using no itching as a reference, multiple logistic regression analysis showed that as hs-CRP level increased, the patient’s risks of mild skin itching (odds ratio [OR] = 1.740; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.061–2.854; P = 0.028), moderate skin itching (OR = 2.8838 95% CI, 1.744–4.718; P &lt; 0.001), and severe skin itching (OR = 9.440; 95% CI, 3.547–25.124; P &lt; 0.001) all increased as well. Compared with urban residents, rural residents have a higher risk of moderate itching (OR = 3.869; 95% CI, 1.099–13.622; P = 0.035). Conclusion Levels of hs-CRP were associated with the intensity of skin itching in patients with UP. Higher hs-CRP levels were closely related to severe skin itching. The relationship between the intensity of skin itching and the environment in maintenance hemodialysis patients needs further clarification."
https://openalex.org/W3125628557,"Background Due to the influence of gender, race/genetics, age, lifestyle habits and geography on the references intervals (RIs), the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) recommends the determination of population-specific RIs. Ghana continues to depend on pre-established RIs from other countries which poses the risk of misdiagnoses and wrong treatment. This study presents the haemato-biochemical RIs from four eco-geographical zones in Ghana. Methods In this population-based cross-sectional study, a total of 1227 randomly selected healthy voluntary blood donors from the four eco-geographic zones (Coastal Savannah, Rain Forest, Savannah and Transitional) were enrolled and screened. Based on the CLSI Guidance Document C28A2992, the data of eligible participants were used to non-parametrically determine the RIs for the haemato-biochemical parameters at the 2.5 th and 97.5 th percentiles. Comparison of analytes by gender was done by Wilcoxon rank sum test and eco-geographic differences were assessed using the Kruskal-Wallis with the Dunn post hoc multiple comparison tests. Results There were statistically significant differences in most of the haematological parameters (RBC, Hb, HCT, MCV, PLT, WBC; p-values &lt;0.0001 and MCH; p-value = 0.007), and biochemical analytes (Urea, Cr, Trig, HDL-C, AST, ALT, ALP, GGT, BID, BIT, Prot-T and Albumin; p-values &lt;0.0001) based on gender. Significant inter eco-geographic (intra-population) variations and substantial differences between the established RI and the RIs accompanying the analyzers used were also observed. Conclusion This study reports significant inter-sex and inter-geographical differences in haemato-biochemical RIs in Ghana as well as differences in RIs with both the RIs accompanying the analyzers and those of other countries. Determining RIs representative of populations and including them in the report systems of laboratories to ensure effective and efficient healthcare service delivery is thus recommended."
https://openalex.org/W3122856758,"Nudix hydrolases attract considerable attention for their wide range of specialized activities in all domains of life. One particular group of Nudix phosphohydrolases (DIPPs), through their metabolism of diphosphoinositol polyphosphates (PP-InsPs), regulates the actions of these polyphosphates upon bioenergetic homeostasis. In the current study, we describe, at an atomic level, hitherto unknown properties of human DIPP1.We provide X-ray analysis of the catalytic core of DIPP1 in crystals complexed with either natural PP-InsPs, alternative PP-InsP stereoisomers, or non-hydrolysable methylene bisphosphonate analogs (""PCP-InsPs""). The conclusions that we draw from these data are interrogated by studying the impact upon catalytic activity upon mutagenesis of certain key residues. We present a picture of a V-shaped catalytic furrow with overhanging ridges constructed from flexible positively charged side chains; within this cavity, the labile phosphoanhydride bond is appropriately positioned at the catalytic site by an extensive series of interlocking polar contacts which we analogize as ""suspension cables."" We demonstrate functionality for a triglycine peptide within a β-strand which represents a non-canonical addition to the standard Nudix catalytic core structure. We describe pre-reaction enzyme/substrate states which we posit to reflect a role for electrostatic steering in substrate capture. Finally, through time-resolved analysis, we uncover a chronological sequence of DIPP1/product post-reaction states, one of which may rationalize a role for InsP6 as an inhibitor of catalytic activity."
https://openalex.org/W3124861298,"While the international pet trade and habitat destruction have been extensively discussed as major threats to the survival of the pancake tortoise ( Malacochersus tornieri ), the impact of climate change on the species remains unknown. In this study, we used species distribution modelling to predict the current and future distribution of pancake tortoises in Zambezian and Somalian biogeographical regions. We used 224 pancake tortoise occurrences obtained from Tanzania, Kenya and Zambia to estimate suitable and stable areas for the pancake tortoise in all countries present in these regions. We also used a protected area network to assess how many of the suitable and stable areas are protected for the conservation of this critically endangered species. Our model predicted the expansion of climatically suitable habitats for pancake tortoises from four countries and a total area of 90,668.75 km 2 to ten countries in the future and an area of 343,459.60–401,179.70 km 2 . The model also showed that a more significant area of climatically suitable habitat for the species lies outside of the wildlife protected areas. Based on our results, we can predict that pancake tortoises may not suffer from habitat constriction. However, the species will continue to be at risk from the international pet trade, as most of the identified suitable habitats remain outside of protected areas. We suggest that efforts to conserve the pancake tortoise should not only focus on protected areas but also areas that are unprotected, as these comprise a large proportion of the suitable and stable habitats available following predicted future climate change."
https://openalex.org/W3122224421,"The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of an industrial passive assisted exoskeleton (IPAE) with simulated lifting tasks on muscle activity, oxygen consumption, perceived level of exertion, local perceived pressure, and systemic usability. Eight workers were required to complete two lifting tasks with and without the IPAE, that were single lifting tasks (repeated 5 times) and 15 min repeated lifting tasks respectively. Both of the tasks required subjects to remove a toolbox from the ground to the waist height. The test results showed that IPAE significantly reduced the muscle activity of the lumbar erector spinae, thoracic erector spinae, middle deltoid and labrum-biceps muscles; the reduction effect during the 15 min lifting task was reached 21%, 12%, 32% and 38% respectively. The exoskeleton did not cause significant differences in oxygen consumption and the perceived level of exertion, but local perceived pressure on the shoulders, thighs, wrists, and waist of the subjects could be produced. 50% of the subjects rated the usability of the equipment as acceptable. The results illustrate the good potential of the exoskeleton to reduce the muscle activity of the low back and upper arms. However, there is still a concern for the obvious contact pressure."
https://openalex.org/W3123208038,"Background In the United States, the internet is widely used to seek health information. Despite an estimated 18 million Google searches on abortion per year and the demonstrated importance of the abortion pill as an option for pregnancy termination, the top webpage search results for abortion pill searches, as well as the content and quality of those webpages, are not well understood. Methods We used Google’s Custom Search Application Programming Interface (API) to identify the top 10 webpages presented for “abortion pill” searches on August 06, 2018. We developed a comprehensive, evidence-based Family Planning Webpage Quality Assessment Tool (FPWQAT), which was used to assess webpage quality for the five top webpages presenting text-based educational content. Results Of the top webpages for “abortion pill” searches, a plannedparenthood.com page was the top result and scored highest on our assessment (81%), providing high-quality and useable information. The other four webpages, a Wikipedia.com page and three anti-abortion information webpages, scored much lower on our assessment (14%-43%). These four webpages had lower quality of information in less useable formats. The anti-abortion pages also presented a variety of disinformation about the abortion pill. Conclusions Both the lack of accurate clinical content on the majority of top webpages and the concerning disinformation they contained raise concerns about the quality of online abortion pill information, while underlining challenges posed by Google search results to informed choice for consumers. Healthcare providers and consumers must be informed of online abortion pill content that is not based in current clinical evidence, while advocates and policymakers should push for online information that is credible and useable. These changes are imperative given the importance of sound abortion pill information for reproductive decision-making at a time when in-person abortion services are further challenged in the US."
https://openalex.org/W3125198606,"Glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) are long and unbranched anionic heteropolysaccharides that have been associated with virtually all amyloid deposits. Soluble sulfated GAGs are known for their propensity to promote the self-assembly of numerous amyloidogenic proteins and to modulate their cytotoxicity. Nonetheless, although GAGs are prevalent on the outer leaflet of eukaryotic cell plasma membrane as part of proteoglycans, their contributions in the perturbation of lipid bilayer induced by amyloid polypeptides remain unknown. Herein, we investigate the roles of GAGs in the cytotoxicity and plasma membrane perturbation induced by the islet amyloid polypeptide (IAPP), whose deposition in the pancreatic islets is associated with type II diabetes. Cellular assays using GAG-deficient cells reveal that GAGs exacerbate IAPP-induced cytotoxicity and permeabilization of the plasma membrane. Confocal microscopy and flow cytometry analyses show that IAPP sequestration at the cell surface is dependent of GAGs and of the aggregation propensity of the peptide. Using giant plasma membrane vesicles (GPMVs) prepared from GAG-deficient cells, we investigate the direct contributions of membrane-embedded proteoglycans in IAPP-induced membrane disassembly. In sharp contrast to soluble sulfated GAGs, kinetics of amyloid self-assembly expose that the presence of GAGs on GPMVs does not significantly modulate in vitro amyloid formation. Overall, this study indicates that cell surface GAGs increase the local concentration of IAPP in the vicinity of the plasma membrane, promoting lipid bilayer perturbation and cell death."
https://openalex.org/W3123559950,"Dysregulation of signaling pathways is responsible for many human diseases. The lack of understanding of the molecular etiology of gastric cancer (GC) poses a substantial challenge to the development of effective cancer therapy. To better understand the molecular mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of GC, which will facilitate the identification and development of effective therapeutic approaches to improve patient outcomes, mass spectrometry-based phosphoproteomics analysis was performed to map the global molecular changes in GC. A total of 530 proteins with altered phosphorylation levels were detected across a panel of 15 normal and GC cell lines. WW domain-binding protein 2 (WBP2) was validated to be upregulated in a subset of GC cell lines. WBP2 is overexpressed in 61% cases of GC compared to non-cancer tissues and high WBP2 expression correlates with poor clinical outcomes. WBP2 was found to be required for GC cell migration but is dispensable for cell growth and proliferation. WBP2 knockdown increased p-LATS2 with a concomitant increase in p-YAP, resulting in the cytoplasmic retention of YAP and ultimately the inhibition of YAP/TEAD activity and downregulation of TEAD target genes––CTGF and CYR61. Importantly, the loss of LATS2 reversed the activation of Hippo pathway caused by WBP2 knockdown, indicating that WBP2 acts through LATS2 to exert its function on the Hippo pathway. Moreover, WBP2 interacted with LATS2 to inhibit its phosphorylation and activity. In conclusion, our study established a pivotal role for WBP2 in the promotion of GC cell migration via a novel mechanism that inactivates the Hippo pathway transducer LATS2."
https://openalex.org/W3123630325,"Depression, cardiovascular diseases and diabetes are among the major non-communicable diseases, leading to significant disability and mortality worldwide. These diseases may share environmental and genetic determinants associated with multimorbid patterns. Stressful early-life events are among the primary factors associated with the development of mental and physical diseases. However, possible causative mechanisms linking early life stress (ELS) with psycho-cardio-metabolic (PCM) multi-morbidity are not well understood. This prevents a full understanding of causal pathways towards the shared risk of these diseases and the development of coordinated preventive and therapeutic interventions.This paper describes the study protocol for EarlyCause, a large-scale and inter-disciplinary research project funded by the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme. The project takes advantage of human longitudinal birth cohort data, animal studies and cellular models to test the hypothesis of shared mechanisms and molecular pathways by which ELS shapes an individual's physical and mental health in adulthood. The study will research in detail how ELS converts into biological signals embedded simultaneously or sequentially in the brain, the cardiovascular and metabolic systems. The research will mainly focus on four biological processes including possible alterations of the epigenome, neuroendocrine system, inflammatome, and the gut microbiome. Life-course models will integrate the role of modifying factors as sex, socioeconomics, and lifestyle with the goal to better identify groups at risk as well as inform promising strategies to reverse the possible mechanisms and/or reduce the impact of ELS on multi-morbidity development in high-risk individuals. These strategies will help better manage the impact of multi-morbidity on human health and the associated risk."
https://openalex.org/W3123743323,"Background The Lagos State Tuberculosis, Buruli Ulcer, and Leprosy Control Program (LSTBLCP) started engaging private hospitals under the Public-Private Mix (PPM) Program in 2008. The study aimed to evaluate the trend and predictors of successful Tuberculosis (TB) treatment outcomes of patients managed across these private health facilities between 2010–2016 in Lagos, Nigeria. Methods Retrospective review of TB treatment register and treatment cards of patients commenced on TB treatment between January 2010 and December 2016 in 36 private health facilities engaged by the LSTBLCP. Between December 2016 and February 2017, data were collected and entered into Microsoft Excel by trained data entry clerks. The analysis was done using SPSS software. Independent predictors of successful treatment outcomes were determined using multivariate analysis at the statistical significance of p&lt;0.05 and 95% confidence interval. Results A total of 1660 records of TB patients were reviewed. 1535 (92.47%) commenced treatment, while 1337 (87.10%) of all records had documented treatment outcomes. Of the 1337 patients with outcomes, 1044 (78.09%) had a successful treatment outcome, and 293 (21.91%) had an unsuccessful outcome. Majority were male, 980 (59.04%), Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) negative status, 1295 (80.24%), diagnosed with smear, 1141 (73.14%), treated in private not-for-profit (PNFP) hospital, 1097 (66.08%), treated for TB between 2014–2016 (18.96%-19.52%). In multivariate analysis, age&gt;20years (aOR = 0.26, p = 0.001), receiving TB treatment in 2013 (aOR = 0.39, p = 0.001), having genexpert for TB diagnosis (aOR = 0.26, p = 0.031) and being HIV positive (aOR = 0.37, p = 0.001) significantly reduced likelihood of successful treatment outcome. The site of TB, being on ART or CPT, were confounding determinants of successful treatment outcomes as they became non-significant at the multivariate analysis level. Conclusion Treatment outcome among Lagos private hospitals was low compared with NTBLCP and World Health Organization (WHO) target. We urge the government and TB stakeholders to strengthen the PPM interventions to improve adherence, particularly among People Living with HIV (PLHIV) and older TB patients. Hence, promotion of early care-seeking, improving diagnostic and case holding efficiencies of health facilities, and TB/HIV collaborative interventions can reduce the risk of an unsuccessful outcome."
https://openalex.org/W3124402991,"Administration of defined amounts of bioactive substances is a perseverative problem in physiological studies on insects. Apart from feeding and injection, topical application of solutions of the chemicals is most commonly used for this purpose. The solvents used should be non-toxic and have least possible effects on the studied parameters. Acetone is widely used for administration of chemical substances to insects, but possible side-effects of acetone application on fitness and behavioral parameters have been rarely investigated. Here we study the effects of acetone application (207 nl) on fitness and sexual communication in the parasitic wasp Nasonia giraulti Darling. Application of acetone had neither negative effects on longevity nor on offspring number and offspring sex ratio of treated wasps. Treatment of females hampered courtship and mating of N . giraulti couples neither directly after application nor one day after. Male sex pheromone titers were not influenced by acetone treatment. Three application examples demonstrate that topical acetone application is capable of bringing active amounts of insect hormones, neuromodulators, and biosynthetic precursors even in tiny insects. We advocate the use of acetone as a convenient, conservative, and broadly applicable vehicle for studying the effects of bioactive substances in insects."
https://openalex.org/W3124456062,"In order to solve the problems of low computational security in the encoding mapping and difficulty in practical operation of biological experiments in DNA-based one-time-pad cryptography, we proposed a one-time-pad cipher algorithm based on confusion mapping and DNA storage technology. In our constructed algorithm, the confusion mapping methods such as chaos map, encoding mapping, confusion encoding table and simulating biological operation process are used to increase the key space. Among them, the encoding mapping and the confusion encoding table provide the realization conditions for the transition of data and biological information. By selecting security parameters and confounding parameters, the algorithm realizes a more random dynamic encryption and decryption process than similar algorithms. In addition, the use of DNA storage technologies including DNA synthesis and high-throughput sequencing ensures a viable biological encryption process. Theoretical analysis and simulation experiments show that the algorithm provides both mathematical and biological security, which not only has the difficult advantage of cracking DNA biological experiments, but also provides relatively high computational security."
https://openalex.org/W3125767596,"Mus musculus and Rattus sp. are considered pest species because they reach high densities in urban areas, crop fields and food storage and productive systems such as breeding farms and orchards. Their control relies mainly on rodenticide application, but the effectiveness of this application is reduced due to behavioural responses and resistance. Novel methods are based on the use of chemical signals as odours that may be attractants, repellents or may reduce the reproductive success of pest species. The aim of this paper is to study the aversive effect of TMT, cat urine and cat body odour on predator-inexperienced Mus musculus and Rattus norvegicus under laboratory conditions. The experimental apparatus comprised three boxes connected by PVC pipes in a linear arrangement. In lateral boxes, odour sources or distilled water were introduced, while animals were placed in the central box at the beginning of the experiment. Rats showed freezing behaviour, reduced visits in the presence of TMT and cat fur. Mice reduced their visits with cat body and cat urine. This study provides evidence of the usefulness of using fear responses as a way to control rodent pests, which must be adapted to the environment and species to be applied."
https://openalex.org/W3122119960,"Hypoxia and hypoxia-regulated factors (eg, hypoxia-inducible factor-1α [Hif-1α], factor inhibiting Hif-1α [Fih-1], thioredoxin-1 [Trx-1], aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator 2 [Arnt-2]) have essential roles in skin wound healing. Using Foxn1−/− mice that can heal skin injuries in a unique scarless manner, we investigated the interaction between Foxn1 and hypoxia-regulated factors. The Foxn1−/− mice displayed impairments in the regulation of Hif-1α, Trx-1, and Fih-1 but not Arnt-2 during the healing process. An analysis of wounded skin showed that the skin of the Foxn1−/− mice healed in a scarless manner, displaying rapid re-epithelialization and an increase in transforming growth factor β (Tgfβ-3) and collagen III expression. An in vitro analysis revealed that Foxn1 overexpression in keratinocytes isolated from the skin of the Foxn1−/− mice led to reduced Hif-1α expression in normoxic but not hypoxic cultures and inhibited Fih-1 expression exclusively under hypoxic conditions. These data indicate that in the skin, Foxn1 affects hypoxia-regulated factors that control the wound healing process and suggest that under normoxic conditions, Foxn1 is a limiting factor for Hif-1α."
https://openalex.org/W3121548621,"Rapid adaptive responses were evident from reciprocal host-plant switches on performance, digestive physiology and relative gene expression of gut serine proteases in larvae of crucifer pest P . brassicae transferred from cauliflower (CF, Brassica oleracea var. botrytis, family Brassicaceae) to an alternate host, garden nasturtium, (GN, Tropaeolum majus L., family Tropaeolaceae) and vice-versa under laboratory conditions. Estimation of nutritional indices indicated that larvae of all instars tested consumed the least food and gained less weight on CF-GN diet (significant at p≤0.05) as compared to larvae feeding on CF-CF, GN-GN and GN-CF diets suggesting that the switch to GN was nutritionally less favorable for larval growth. Nevertheless, these larvae, especially fourth instars, were adroit in utilizing and digesting GN as a new host plant type. In vitro protease assays conducted to understand associated physiological responses within twelve hours indicated that levels and properties of gut proteases were significantly influenced by type of natal host-plant consumed, change in diet as well as larval age. Activities of gut trypsins and chymotrypsins in larvae feeding on CF-GN and GN-CF diets were distinct, and represented shifts toward profiles observed in larvae feeding continuously on GN-GN and CF-CF diets respectively. Results with diagnostic protease inhibitors like TLCK, STI and SBBI in these assays and gelatinolytic zymograms indicated complex and contrasting trends in gut serine protease activities in different instars from CF-GN diet versus GN-CF diet, likely due to ingestion of plant protease inhibitors present in the new diet. Cloning and sequencing of serine protease gene fragments expressed in gut tissues of fourth instar P . brassicae revealed diverse transcripts encoding putative trypsins and chymotrypsins belonging to at least ten lineages. Sequences of members of each lineage closely resembled lepidopteran serine protease orthologs including uncharacterized transcripts from Pieris rapae . Differential regulation of serine protease genes (Pbr1-Pbr5) was observed in larval guts of P . brassicae from CF-CF and GN-GN diets while expression of transcripts encoding two putative trypsins (Pbr3 and Pbr5) were significantly different in larvae from CF-GN and GN-CF diets. These results suggested that some gut serine proteases that were differentially expressed in larvae feeding on different species of host plants were also involved in rapid adaptations to dietary switches. A gene encoding nitrile-specifier protein ( nsp) likely involved in detoxification of toxic products from interactions of ingested host plant glucosinolates with myrosinases was expressed to similar levels in these larvae. Taken together, these snapshots reflected contrasts in physiological and developmental plasticity of P . brassicae larvae to nutritional challenges from wide dietary switches in the short term and the prominent role of gut serine proteases in rapid dietary adaptations. This study may be useful in designing novel management strategies targeting candidate gut serine proteases of P . brassicae using RNA interference, gene editing or crops with transgenes encoding protease inhibitors from taxonomically-distant host plants."
https://openalex.org/W3123741490,"Introduction Globally an estimated 55.9 million abortions occur each year. The majority of abortions occur due to unintended pregnancies, which is a result of the non-use of family planning methods. World health organization recommends all clients to utilize modern contraceptive methods after any abortion procedure. However, post-abortion family planning utilization is still low in Ethiopia including the study area. Therefore, this study was expected to determine the utilization of post-abortion family planning and associated factors in Bahir Dar city health facilities in Northwest Ethiopia. Method Institution based cross-sectional study was conducted among 408 women from March 1 to April 30, 2019. Data were collected through face-to-face interview using a structured and pre-tested questionnaire. Systematic random sampling was used to select the study participants. Data were cleaned, coded, and entered into epi data and exported to SPSS for further analysis. Both bivariable and multivariable logistic regression were employed. Those variables that had a p-value of less than 0.2 during the bivariate analysis were retained for the multivariable analysis. P-value and confidence interval were used to measure the level of significance on multi-variable analysis and those variables whose P-value, less than 0.05 was considered as statistically significant. Results The finding of this study showed that the magnitude of post-abortion family planning (PAFP) utilization was 61% with 95% CI (55, 65). Secondary education level(AOR, 4.58; 95% CI (1.96, 10.69)), certificate and above education level (AOR, 3.06; 95% CI (1.32, 7.08)), Manual Vacuum Aspiration(MVA) (AOR, 7.05; 95% CI (2.94, 16.90)), both medication and Manual Vacuum Aspiration (AOR, 5.34; 95% CI (2.56, 11.13)) and received Post Abortion Family Planning (PAFP) counseling (AOR, 5.99; 95% CI (3.23, 11.18)) were significantly associated with PAFP utilization. Conclusion Post-abortion family planning utilization in Bahir Dar health facilities was low compared with the national figure. Secondary and above educational level, respondents who were managed by Manual Vacuum Aspiration (MVA), both Manual Vacuum Aspiration (MVA) and medication and receiving Post Abortion Family Planning (PAFP) counseling were predictors of post-abortion family planning service utilization."
https://openalex.org/W3124247976,"Insulin-regulated glucose homeostasis is a critical and intricate physiological process, of which not all regulatory components have been deciphered. One of the key players in modulating glucose uptake by cells is the glucose transporter-GLUT4. In this study, we aimed to explore the regulatory role of the trans-Golgi-associated protein-TATA Element Modulatory Factor (TMF1) in the GLUT4 mediated, insulin-directed glucose uptake. By establishing and using TMF1−/− myoblasts and mice, we examined the effect of TMF1 absence on the insulin driven functioning of GLUT4. We show that TMF1 is upregulated by insulin in myoblasts, and is essential for the formation of insulin responsive, glucose transporter GLUT4-containing vesicles. Absence of TMF1 leads to the retention of GLUT4 in perinuclear compartments, and to severe impairment of insulin-stimulated GLUT4 trafficking throughout the cytoplasm and to the cell plasma membrane. Accordingly, glucose uptake is impaired in TMF1−/− cells, and TMF1−/− mice are hyperglycemic. This is reflected by the mice impaired blood glucose clearance and increased blood glucose level. Correspondingly, TMF1−/− animals are leaner than their normal littermates. Thus, TMF1 is a novel effector of insulin-regulated glucose homeostasis, and dys-functioning of this protein may contribute to the onset of a diabetes-like disorder."
https://openalex.org/W3123871276,"Canine inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a group of chronic gastrointestinal disorders, the pathogenesis of which remains elusive, but it possibly involves the interaction of the intestinal immune system with luminal microbiota and food-derived antigens. Mucosal cytokines profiles in canine IBD have been investigated mainly in small intestinal disease, while data on cytokine profiles in large intestinal IBD are limited. The objective of this study was to measure colonic mucosal and cytobrush sample messenger (m)RNA expression of interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-2, IL-12p40, IL-23p19, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) and chemokine C‐C motif ligand (CCL28) in dogs with IBD and healthy controls using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and assess their correlation with clinical disease activity, endoscopic and histopathologic score. Dogs with IBD had a significantly increased mRNA expression of IL-1β, IL-23p19 and CCL28 in the colonic mucosa, compared to healthy controls. None of the selected cytokines had significantly different mRNA expression in the colonic cytobrush samples between the two groups or between the colonic mucosa and cytobrush samples of dogs with IBD. Finally, there was a statistically significant correlation of clinical disease activity with endoscopic activity score and fibrosis and atrophy of the colonic mucosa in dogs with large intestinal IBD. IL-1β, IL-23p19 and CCL28 could play a role in the pathogenesis of canine large intestinal IBD. Colonic cytokine expression does not correlate with clinical disease activity and/or endoscopic score. However, clinical signs reflect the severity of endoscopic lesions."
https://openalex.org/W3126075816,"Single molecule localization microscopy (SMLM) has enormous potential for resolving subcellular structures below the diffraction limit of light microscopy: Localization precision in the low digit nanometer regime has been shown to be achievable. In order to record localization microscopy data, however, sample fixation is inevitable to prevent molecular motion during the rather long recording times of minutes up to hours. Eventually, it turns out that preservation of the sample's ultrastructure during fixation becomes the limiting factor. We propose here a workflow for data analysis, which is based on SMLM performed at cryogenic temperatures. Since molecular dipoles of the fluorophores are fixed at low temperatures, such an approach offers the possibility to use the orientation of the dipole as an additional information for image analysis. In particular, assignment of localizations to individual dye molecules becomes possible with high reliability. We quantitatively characterized the new approach based on the analysis of simulated oligomeric structures. Side lengths can be determined with a relative error of less than 1% for tetramers with a nominal side length of 5 nm, even if the assumed localization precision for single molecules is more than 2 nm."

Without the war in Syria under President Assad and the associated mass exodus of Syrian refugees, the population trends in distant countries like Sweden and Norway over the last few years would have been different. We create hypothetical scenarios of the population developments in Sweden and Norway without a war in Syria from 2011 onwards, where excess immigration due to the war and associated excess births are removed. The results indicate that population growth in 2016 would have been roughly 36% lower in Sweden and 26% lower in Norway without the Syrian war. The number of births in 2017 would have been about 3% lower in Sweden and 1% lower in Norway. One in ten municipalities would have had a population decline in 2016 instead of a population increase, and the largest immigrant group in Sweden by January 2019 would still be of Finnish origin."

A combined study of DNA sequencing data from the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) of nuclear ribosomal DNA and the trn K -mat K region of chloroplast DNA was used to identify the parents of Cryptocoryne putative hybrids from Peninsular Malaysia. Based on the intermediate morphology and sympatric distribution area, the plants were tentatively identified as the hybrid Cryptocoryne × purpurea nothovar. purpurea . The plants were pollen sterile and had long been considered as hybrids, supposedly between two related and co-existing species, C . cordata var. cordata and C . griffithii . The status of C . × purpurea nothovar. purpurea was independently confirmed by the presence of an additive ITS sequence pattern from these two parental species in hybrid individuals. An analysis of the chloroplast trn K -mat K sequences showed that the hybridization is bidirectional with the putative hybrids sharing identical sequences from C . cordata var. cordata and C . griffithii , indicating that both putative parental species had been the maternal parent in different accessions."
https://openalex.org/W3125423522,"Background Puerto Rican adults have higher odds of peripheral artery disease (PAD) compared with Mexican Americans. Limited studies have examined relationships between clinical risk assessment scores and ABI measures in this population. Methods Using 2004–2015 data from the Boston Puerto Rican Health Study (BPRHS) ( n = 370–583), cross-sectional, 5-y change, and patterns of change in Framingham Risk Score (FRS) and allostatic load (AL) with ankle brachial index (ABI) at 5-y follow-up were assessed among Puerto Rican adults (45–75 y). FRS and AL were calculated at baseline, 2-y and 5-y follow-up. Multivariable linear regression models were used to examine cross-sectional and 5-y changes in FRS and AL with ABI at 5-y. Latent growth mixture modeling identified trajectories of FRS and AL over 5-y, and multivariable linear regression models were used to test associations between trajectory groups at 5-y. Results Greater FRS at 5-y and increases in FRS from baseline were associated with lower ABI at 5-y (β = -0.149, P = 0.010; β = -0.171, P = 0.038, respectively). AL was not associated with ABI in cross-sectional or change analyses. Participants in low-ascending (vs. no change) FRS trajectory, and participants in moderate-ascending (vs. low-ascending) AL trajectory, had lower 5-y ABI (β = -0.025, P = 0.044; β = -0.016, P = 0.023, respectively). Conclusions FRS was a better overall predictor of ABI, compared with AL. Puerto Rican adults, an understudied population with higher FRS over 5 years, may benefit from intensive risk factor modification to reduce risk of PAD. Additional research examining relationships between FRS and AL and development of PAD is warranted."
https://openalex.org/W3125542003,"Many economists claim that asset price transitions, particularly stock price transitions, have a seasonal cycle affected by length of daylight. Although they claim that the seasonal affective disorder (SAD) is a mediator between the length of daylight and asset price transitions, recent studies in psychology have been inconclusive about the existence of SAD, and some economics studies disagree regarding the involvement of SAD in seasonal stock price transitions. The purpose of the present study is to examine if there is any psychological mediator linking length of daylight and seasonal asset price transitions as an alternative or supplement to SAD. As a possible mediator, we examined Japan’s consumer confidence index (CCI) and asset value expectations (AVE), which indicate people’s optimism for future economy and are generated from a monthly household survey by the Japanese government. We analyzed individual longitudinal data from this survey between 2004 and 2018 and estimated four fixed-effects regression models to control for time-invariant unobserved heterogeneity across individual households. The results revealed that, (i) there was a seasonal cycle of CCI and AVE; the trough occurred in December and the peak in early summer; (ii) the length of daylight time was positively associated with CCI and AVE; and (iii) the higher the latitude, the larger the seasonal cycle of CCI and AVE became. These findings suggest that the length of the daylight may affect asset price transitions through the cycle of optimism/pessimism for future economy exemplified by the CCI and AVE."
