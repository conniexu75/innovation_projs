https://openalex.org/W2007689766,"Fas is a type-I membrane protein that transduces an apoptotic signal. Binding of Fas ligand or agonistic anti-Fas antibody to Fas kills the cells by apoptosis. Studies in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans have suggested that proteases such as interleukin-1 beta-converting enzyme (ICE) or the product of the C. elegans cell-death gene ced-3 are involved in apoptotic signal transduction. The activity of ICE can be inhibited by the product of crmA, a cytokine-response modifier gene encoded by cowpox virus. We report here that expression of crmA inhibits cytotoxicity induced by anti-Fas antibody or tumour necrosis factor (TNF). We have found a specific ICE inhibitor tetrapeptide (acetyl-Tyr-Val-Ala-Asp-chloromethylketone) that also prevents apoptosis induced by anti-Fas antibody. These results suggest an involvement of an ICE-like protease in Fas-mediated apoptosis and TNF-induced cytotoxicity."
https://openalex.org/W2031129569,"We have used a combination of genetics and pharmacology to assess the effects of reduced DNA methyltransferase activity on ApcMin-induced intestinal neoplasia in mice. A reduction in the DNA methyltransferase activity in Min mice due to heterozygosity of the DNA methyltransferase gene, in conjunction with a weekly dose of the DNA methyltransferase inhibitor 5-aza-deoxycytidine, reduced the average number of intestinal adenomas from 113 in the control mice to only 2 polyps in the treated heterozygotes. Hence, DNA methyltransferase activity contributes substantially to tumor development in this mouse model of intestinal neoplasia. Our results argue against an oncogenic effect of DNA hypomethylation. Moreover, they are consistent with a role for DNA methyltransferase in the generation of the C to T transitions seen at high frequency in human colorectal tumors."
https://openalex.org/W2021126994,"THE Fas/APO-1 receptor is one of the major regulators of apoptosis1á€-7. We report here that Fas/APO-1-mediated apoptosis requires the activation of a new class of cysteine proteases, including interleukin-lβ-converting enzyme (ICE)8á€-10, which are homologous to the product of the Caenorhabditis elegans cell-death gene ced-3 (refs 11, 12). Triggering of Fas/APO-1 rapidly stimulated the proteolytic activity of ICE. Overexpression of ICE, achieved by electroporation and microinjection, strongly potentiated Fas/ APO-1-mediated cell death. In addition, inhibition of ICE activity by protease inhibitors, as well as by transient expression of the pox virus-derived serpin inhibitor CrmA or an antisense ICE construct, substantially suppressed Fas/APO-1-triggered cell death. We conclude that activation of ICE or an ICE-related protease is a critical event in Fas/APO-1-mediated cell death."
https://openalex.org/W2026549568,"After germinal center B cells undergo somatic mutation and antigen selection, they become either memory B cells or plasma cells, but the signal requirements that control entry into either pathway have been unclear. When purified human germinal center cells were cultured with interleukin-2, interleukin-10, and cells expressing CD40 ligand, cells with characteristics of memory B cells were generated. Removal of CD40 ligand from the system resulted in terminal differentiation of germinal center B cells into cells with the characteristics of plasma cells. These results indicate that CD40 ligand directs the differentiation of germinal center B cells toward memory B cells rather than toward plasma cells."

https://openalex.org/W1967628309,"B61, a cytokine-inducible endothelial gene product, is the ligand for the Eck receptor protein tyrosine kinase (RPTK). Expression of a B61-immunoglobulin chimera showed that B61 could act as an angiogenic factor in vivo and a chemoattractant for endothelial cells in vitro. The Eck RPTK was activated by tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) through induction of B61, and an antibody to B61 attenuated angiogenesis induced by TNF-alpha but not by basic fibroblast growth factor. This finding suggests the existence of an autocrine or paracrine loop involving activation of the Eck RPTK by its inducible ligand B61 after an inflammatory stimulus, the net effect of which would be to promote angiogenesis, a hallmark of chronic inflammation."
https://openalex.org/W2033813366,"Endotoxin (lipopolysaccharide; LPS) activates a wide variety of host defense mechanisms. In mammals LPS binding protein (LBP) and CD14 interact with LPS to mediate cellular activation. Using sucrose density gradients and a fluorescent endotoxin derivative we have investigated the mechanism of LPS binding to LBP and the soluble form of CD14 (sCD14). LPS binds to LBP to form two types of complex; at low ratios of LPS to LBP complexes with one molecule of LBP and 1-2 molecules of LPS predominate, while at high ratios of LPS to LBP a large aggregate of LBP and LPS predominates. Complexes of LPS with sCD14 do not form large aggregates, consisting of only 1-2 LPS bound to a single sCD14 even at high multiples of LPS to sCD14. LBP catalyzes LPS binding to sCD14. Catalysis by LBP apparently occurs because LBP provides a pathway for LPS to bind to sCD14 which avoids the necessity for LPS monomers in aqueous solution. The dissociation constants for LPS·LBP and LPS·sCD14 complexes were determined to be 3.5 × 10−9 and 29 × 10−9M, respectively. These numbers suggest that when LBP and sCD14 are present at roughly equal concentrations as they are in normal human plasma and compete for limited LPS, the LPS will predominantly associate with LBP.

The exposure of organisms as diverse as horseshoe crabs and mammals to endotoxin (lipopolysaccharide, LPS)1( 1The abbreviations used are: LPSlipopolysaccharideLBPLPS binding proteinsCD14soluble CD14FITCfluorescein isothiocyanateASD2-(p-azido-salicylamido)ethyl-1,3’-dithiopropionyl. ) results in the activation of a wide variety of host defense mechanisms. Recent studies of mammalian cells have described a unified pathway for the LPS-dependent activation of many cell types including monocytes, macrophages, neutrophils, endothelial cells, smooth muscle cells, and some epithelial cell lines. The common elements of the pathway include LPS binding protein (LBP), a 60-kDa plasma glycoprotein, and CD14, a 55-kDa glycoprotein. On monocytes, macrophages, and neutrophils, CD14 is present as a glycerophosphoinositol tailed membrane (mCD14) component (1Haziot A. Chen S. Ferrero E. Low M.G. Silber R. Goyert S.M. J. Immunol. 1988; 141: 547-552PubMed Google Scholar). In the presence of LBP, LPS binds to the mCD14 and initiates cellular activation (2Schumann R.R. Leong S.R. Flaggs G.W. Gray P.W. Wright S.D.

Science. 1990; 249: 1431-1433Crossref PubMed Scopus (3398) Google Scholar). However, other LPS-responsive cells such as endothelial cells, smooth muscle cells, and some epithelial cell lines do not express mCD14. Instead, they have a receptor for complexes of LPS with the soluble form of CD14 (sCD14), which circulates in plasma without a glycerophosphoinositol tail (4Pugin J. Schurer-Maly C.-C. Leturcq D.

Here again, LBP facilitates the formation of LPS·sCD14 complexes. lipopolysaccharide LPS binding protein soluble CD14 fluorescein isothiocyanate 2-(p-azido-salicylamido)ethyl-1,3’-dithiopropionyl. In this report we describe the use of fluorescein-derivatized LPS (FITC-LPS) to permit continuous monitoring of the formation of LPS·LBP and LPS·sCD14 complexes. Heretofore it has not been possible to observe the formation of LPS·LBP and LPS·sCD14 complexes on a real time basis with a method that also permits the quantitative determination of kinetic and equilibrium parameters for formation of these complexes. We also describe our characterization of LPS·LBP and LPS·sCD14 complexes using sucrose density gradients. Others have used nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis to characterize LPS protein complexes (7Hailman E. Lichenstein H.S. Wurfel M.M. Miller D.S. Johnson D.A. Kelley M. Busse L.A. Zukowski M.M. Wright S.D. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 179: 269-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (617) Google Scholar), but we found sucrose density gradients more useful since they permit more analysis of the separated components. Taken together, we conclude from these results that LBP catalyses the formation of LPS·sCD14 complexes and suggest a mechanistic pathway by which this occurs. Salmonella minnesota Re595 LPS was isolated and fluoresceinated with fluorescein isothiocyanate (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) by published methods (8Galanos C. Luderitz O. Westphal O. Eur. J. Biochem. 1969; 9: 245-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (1366) Google Scholar, 9Skelly R.R. Munkenbeck P. Morrison D.C. Infect. Immun. 1979; 23: 287-293Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). FITC-LPS from several commercial sources was not useful for these experiments. The LPS concentration of the derivative was determined by assay of the 2-keto-3-deoxyoctulosonic acid and measurement of the fluorescein content by optical density at 493 nm as described (9Skelly R.R. Munkenbeck P. Morrison D.C. Infect. Immun. 1979; 23: 287-293Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The products used here had substitution ratios of 20-30 mol % fluorescein. Based on the structure of S. minnesota Re595 LPS, its molecular weight was taken to be 2300 (10Galanos C. Luderitz O. Freudenberg M. Brade L. Schade U. Rietschel E. Kusumoto S. Shiba T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1986; 160: 55-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). While the derivatization procedure used to make FITC-LPS may alter its physical properties from the unsubstituted molecule, the FITC-LPS and the [125I]ASD-LPS retain their biological activity (data not shown). Rabbit LBP was isolated from acute-phase rabbit serum (11Tobias P.S. Soldau K. Ulevitch R.J. J. Exp. Med. 1986; 164: 777-793Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar). Human recombinant soluble sCD14 was isolated by immunoaffinity chromatography (Immunopure Protein G IgG Orientation Kit, Pierce, Rockford, IL) using monoclonal antibody 63D3 (American Type Culture Collection, Rockville, MD) from the supernatants of Chinese hamster ovary cells transfected, essentially as described in Ref. 12Lee J.-D. Kravchenko V. Kirkland T.N. Han J. Machman N. Moriarty A. Leturcq D. Tobias P.S. Ulevitch R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 9930-9934Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar, with the cDNA for human CD14. To prepare 35S-labeled sCD14 and 35S-labeled sLBP CD14 or LBP, expressing Chinese hamster ovary cells were metabolically labeled with [35S]Met (DuPont NEN, Boston, MA). The labeled proteins were prepared from 24-h culture supernatants by immunopurification using mAb 63D3 for sCD14 and mAb 18G4 for LBP. The mAb 18G4 as well as mAb 2B5, with specificity for human LBP, were kindly provided by D. Leturcq and A. Moriarty (R. W. Johnson Pharmaceutical Research Institute, La Jolla, CA). [125I]ASD-LPS was prepared from S. minnesota Re595 LPS as described (11Tobias P.S. Soldau K. Ulevitch R.J. J. Exp. Med. 1986; 164: 777-793Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar). 3H-Labeled LPS and non-radioactive LPS from Salmonella typhimurium PR122(Rc) was obtained either from R. Munford (13Munford R.S. DeVeaux L.C. Cronan Jr., J.E. Rick P.D. J. Immunol. Methods. 1992; 148: 115-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) or commercially (List Biologicals, Campbell, CA). Sucrose density gradients were centrifuged for 1 h 20 min at 4°C in a pre-chilled TV-865 rotor (DuPont, Burbank, CA) at 55,000 rpm. The gradients were 4 ml of 5-20% sucrose in 0.05 M phosphate, 0.14 M NaCl, 2 mM EDTA, pH 7.4, layered onto 0.2 ml of 40% sucrose. The samples were incubated at 37°C for 15 min and then chilled to 4°C before 0.2 ml was layered on top of the gradient; aliquots of the samples were removed before centrifugation to determine total radioactive material for calculation of recovery. Typically, recovery of radioactive material from the gradients was 65-95%. Fluorescence was monitored using an SLM 8000 fluorimeter (SLM Instruments, Urbana, IL) with excitation at 490 nm and emission at 520 nm. In plain glass cuvettes (7 mm × 45 mm, Sienco, Morrison, CO) 35S-labeled LBP was observed to disappear from solution at a significant rate, presumably by adsorption to the glass (data not shown). In order to minimize binding of LBP and FITC-LPS to the cuvettes, they were filled with 10 mg/ml bovine serum albumin (Sigma) in water for 1 h after which they were extensively rinsed with water and stored moist at 4°C. As indicated by the slow declines of fluorescence seen at long times in some figures, this procedure is not totally successful. Reactions were conducted in 50 mM phosphate, 100 mM NaCl, 2 mM EDTA at pH 7.4, except for the experiments reported in Fig. 3 b which were conducted in 10 mM phosphate, 2 mM EDTA, at pH 7.4 with KCl as required. Apparent pseudo-first order rate constants and dissociation constants were obtained from the fluorescence data using the curve fitting procedures of SigmaPlot (Jandel Scientific, San Rafael, CA). When loss of fluorescence due to adsorption to the cuvette was significant (see above), it was included as a time linear component of the overall fluorescent change. In some instances the amount of FITC-LPS approached 10% of the binding protein. Therefore, in all cases, Kdvalues were obtained by fitting the data to a “quadratic” hyperbola rather than a “rectangular” hyperbola as defined by Equation 1, F=(∆F/[L])*(((L+P+K)-SQRT((L+P+K)2-4*L*P))/2)(Eq. 1) On-line formulae not verified for accuracy where F is the observed fluorescence, L and P are the concentrations of FITC-LPS and protein, respectively, SQRT is the square root operator, and Δ F and K, the overall fluorescence change and the dissociation constant respectively, are the fitted parameters. The photoaffinity probe [125I] ASD-LPS (8 × 10−9M) was incubated with several mixtures of sCD14 and LBP (see legend to Fig. 6) at 37°C for 15 min before chilling to 4°C for photolysis as described previously (11Tobias P.S. Soldau K. Ulevitch R.J. J. Exp. Med. 1986; 164: 777-793Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar). The proteins were then separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis using a 10% acrylamide gel and detected by autoradiography after Coomassie staining to detect protein molecular weight markers (Sigma). When 3H-labeled LPS or 35S-labeled LBP are separately subjected to sucrose density gradient sedimentation, their mobilities are quite different as shown in Fig. 1, panels a and b, respectively. The concentrations of 3H-labeled LPS and 35S-labeled LBP used, as well as the mole ratios of the incubation mixtures and the resulting sucrose density gradient peaks, are given in Table I. As indicated by the mobilities of albumin and ovalbumin (data not shown), 35S-labeled LBP sediments with the mobility expected for a 60-kDa protein. However, 3H-labeled LPS has a mobility considerably higher than would be warranted by its molecular weight of 4000 (13Munford R.S. DeVeaux L.C. Cronan Jr., J.E. Rick P.D. J. Immunol. Methods. 1992; 148: 115-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), indicating a high degree of aggregation. When 3H-labeled LPS and 35S-labeled LBP are mixed and incubated for 15 min at 37°C before sedimentation, the mobility of the 3H-labeled LPS shifts to the mobility of LBP while the mobility of the 35S-labeled LBP does not increase (Fig. 1, panel c). This could be the result either of LPS binding to LBP or simply disaggregation of the 3H-labeled LPS. Since [125I]ASD-LPS and LBP can be demonstrated to form a complex at lower concentrations than used here (see Fig. 6), we conclude that a complex of 3H-labeled LPS and 35S-labeled LBP has formed and that this complex has the mobility of 35S-labeled LBP. As the amount of 3H-labeled LPS used is increased, a high mobility complex 3H-labeled LPS and 35S-labeled LBP is formed (panels c-e). However, the mobility of the complex is not determined by the absolute amount of 3H-labeled LPS used, but rather the 3H-LPS:35S-LBP ratio, as is seen by comparing panel f with d and e. In summary, these data suggest that 3H-labeled LPS and 35S-labeled LBP may form two sorts of complex depending on the LPS:LBP ratio. One complex contains a single LBP and a small number (1Haziot A. Chen S. Ferrero E. Low M.G. Silber R. Goyert S.M. J. Immunol. 1988; 141: 547-552PubMed Google Scholar, 2Schumann R.R. Leong S.R. Flaggs G.W. Gray P.W. Wright S.D. Mathison J.C. Tobias P.S. Ulevitch R.J. Science. 1990; 249: 1429-1431Crossref PubMed Scopus (1378) Google Scholar) of LPS molecules. The other contains a large number of LPS and probably multiple LBP.Table IFig. 1 sucrose density gradients: LPS and LBP Open table in a new tab When 3H-labeled LPS, 35S-labeled sCD14, and LBP are mixed in various concentrations (see Table II) and subjected to sucrose density gradient sedimentation, an 3H-LPS·35S-sCD14 complex forms only in the presence of LBP, as shown in Fig. 2. As was the case with 35S-labeled LBP, 3H-labeled LPS and 35S-labeled sCD14 sediment distinctly differently in the sucrose gradients (Fig. 2, panels a and b). However, in contrast to the case with 35S-labeled LBP, no obvious 3H-LPS·35S-sCD14 complex is formed when the two are simply mixed (Fig. 2, panel c). Addition of a small amount of LBP does enable an 3H-LPS·35S-sCD14 complex to form (Fig. 2, panel d). With 35S-labeled sCD14, however, only one size of 3H-LPS·35S-sCD14 complex is seen despite the use of relatively very high concentrations of 3H-labeled LPS (Fig. 2, panels e and f) compared to the concentrations used to generate large complexes of 3H-labeled LPS with 35S-labeled LBP. The mole ratio of LPS:sCD14 in the complexes (see Table II) is distinctly less than that in the incubation mixtures when LPS is in excess. Both the size and composition of the LPS·sCD14 complexes suggest that sCD14 can only complex with a limited number of LPS molecules.Table IIFig. 2 sucrose density gradients: LPS, sCD14, and LBP Open table in a new tab To develop a system that would permit real time determinations of the kinetics and equilibria governing interaction of LPS with LBP and sCD14 we asked whether the fluorescence signal of FITC-LPS would change upon complexation with LBP or sCD14. We observed an approximately 3-fold enhancement of fluorescence. The physical basis for this enhancement is not totally defined, but probably derives from relief of self-quenching in aggregates of FITC-LPS. S. minnesota Re595 LPS is undoubtedly strongly aggregated as are many types of LPS (14Takayama K. Mitchell D.H. Din Z.Z. Mukerjee P. Li C. Coleman D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2241-2244Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We observed that n-octyl-β-D-glucopyranoside also enhances the fluorescence, again suggesting that aggregate dissociation is responsible. As indicated by the sucrose density gradients of Figs. 1 and 2, incubation of 3H-labeled LPS with excess LBP or sCD14 reduces it's sedimentation velocity essentially to that of the protein, suggesting disaggregation of the 3H-labeled LPS. The time dependence of the fluorescence change when 4.2 × 10−9M FITC-LPS reacts with a 10-fold excess of LBP (4.2 × 10-8M) is shown in Fig. 3 a. The initial fluorescence is that of the buffer alone. FITC-LPS and LBP were added at points “a” and “b” respectively. The fluorescence change from 120 s, a time just beyond point b, to 250 s was fit as a first order process. The individual data points and the calculated first order curve are shown in the inset with kexp = 4.7 × 10-2 s-1. Experiments like these were conducted at a variety of FITC-LPS and LBP concentrations to characterize the kinetics of FITC·LPS·LBP complex formation. Over 2 orders of magnitude in [LBP], 4 × 10-10 to 4 × 10-8M, kexp did not change significantly. These data suggest that formation of FITC·LPS·LBP complexes from LPSagg and LBP is a two-step process as shown in Fig. S1 and that the molecularity of LBP does not change during the rate-limiting step. Because we can directly observe LBP bound to LPS aggregates (see Fig. 1) we favor a reaction scheme for FITC-LPS-LBP formation in which LBP rapidly binds to FITC-LPS aggregates. Subsequently, FITC·LPS·LBP complexes dissociate from these aggregates in the rate-limiting step. The rate of FITC-LPS-LBP formation was found to be strongly dependent on the salt concentration. The value of kexp was determined in 10 mM phosphate buffer at several concentrations of KCl as shown in Fig. 3 b. This observation is consistent with the idea that FITC-LPS-LBP formation involves transfer of hydrophobic structures such as the fatty acid tails of lipid A through a polar environment (15Tanford C. The Hydrophobic Effect: Formation of Micelles and Biological Membranes. Wiley-Interscience, New York1980Google Scholar). The KDfor FITC·LPS·LBP complexes was obtained by analyzing the dependence on [LBP] of the difference in fluorescence between FITC-LPS alone and at the end of the association reaction. The data and their fit to an hyperbola are shown in Fig. 3 c from which Kd= 0.81(± 0.34) × 10−9M. The average of three determinations of KDwas 3.5 × 10−9M with a range of 0.81 to 6.1 × 10−9M. As one would expect, unfluoresceinated Re595 LPS competes with FITC-LPS for binding to LBP (data not shown). Furthermore, monoclonal antibody 2B5, which binds LBP and blocks LPS binding to recombinant mCD14 expressing Chinese hamster ovary cells (16Gegner J.A. Ulevitch R.J. Tobias P.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5320-5325Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar) also blocks FITC-LPS binding to LBP (data not shown). Because complexes of LPS with either mCD14 or sCD14 are critical for activation of most LPS-sensitive cells, we investigated the reaction of FITC-LPS with sCD14. The data of Fig. 4 demonstrate the role of LBP in the binding of FITC-LPS to sCD14. At time A, 10 ng/ml FITC-LPS (4.5 × 10−9M) was added to the cuvette, followed by 10 μg/ml sCD14 (1.8 × 10-7M) at time B. The fluorescence does not change until time C, when LBP is added at 0.04 μg/ml (6.6 × 10-10M). At the end of the ensuing fluorescence change, i.e. at about 300 s elapsed time, one may ask whether LBP has limited the reaction, since it is at the lowest concentration. Addition of another aliquot of LBP at C’ does not cause a further fluorescence change, nor does addition of another aliquot of sCD14 at B’. Only addition of more FITC-LPS at A’ causes a further increase in fluorescence. Since LBP was not limiting at the end of the first reaction, since almost no reaction occurred in its absence, and because 7 mol of FITC-LPS/mol of LBP bound to sCD14, we conclude that LBP must have catalyzed the binding of FITC-LPS to sCD14. In the experiments summarized in Fig. 5b, at the lowest LBP concentrations used nearly 500 mol of FITC-LPS bound to sCD14/mol of LBP.Figure 5:a, the net change in fluorescence upon mixing sCD14 with 4 × 10−9M FITC-LPS in the presence of 5 × 10-10M LBP.

From four similar experiments, the KDdetermination averaged 2.9 × 10-8M (± 30%). Changing the FITC-LPS concentration 4-fold, and changing the LBP concentration 2-fold had no observable effect on the value of the KD. This is consistent with the sucrose density gradient data which suggest that LBP is not a constituent of the FITC·LPS·sCD14 complexes. The kinetics of formation of FITC·LPS·sCD14 complexes as a function of LBP and sCD14 concentrations are shown in Fig. 5, b and c. In the absence of LBP a rate constant of 1.7 × 10-4 s-1 was observed. Fig. 5, b and c, suggest that as the protein concentration increases, there is a change in the rate-limiting step of the overall reaction, as discussed in the context of Fig. S1. As discussed above for Fig. 4, when LBP is at a low concentration relative to sCD14, the FITC-LPS transfers to sCD14. However, the determined values for the relative KDvalues of FITC-LPS-LBP and FITC-LPS-sCD14, 3.5 × 10−9M and 29 × 10−9M, respectively, suggest that as the ratio of LBP to sCD14 changes, the association of FITC-LPS with LBP and sCD14 should change. More specifically, at an LBP:sCD14 ratio of 1:8 the FITC-LPS should be approximately equally distributed between the two proteins. Since the fluorescence signals of the FITC·LPS·LBP and FITC·LPS·sCD14 complexes are essentially identical and will not permit verification of this prediction, we have used the radioiodinated, photoactivatable derivative of Re595 LPS, namely [125I]ASD-LPS, to verify this prediction. Fig. 6 shows the relative labeling of LBP and sCD14 when 5 × 10−9M (0.3 μg/ml) LBP and varying amounts of sCD14 are incubated and photolyzed with 8 × 10−9M [125I]ASD-LPS. As can be seen the labeling of the two proteins is roughly equal at an sCD14 concentration of between 2 × 10-8 and 5 × 10-8M, verifiying the prediction made from the values of KDdetermined with FITC-LPS. Heretofore it has not been possible to monitor the interaction of LPS with any LPS binding protein on a continuous, quantitative basis to explore the mechanism, kinetics, and equilibria of the reaction. While several strategems have been employed to determine binding affinities for LPS with several binding proteins (17Tobias P.S. Soldau K. Ulevitch R.J. J. Biol.

Through the use of FITC-LPS, many, although not all, of the difficulties are removed. If, as we hypothesize, the increase in fluorescence derives from relief of fluorescein self-quenching in an FITC-LPS aggregate, then the method will not be useful for types of FITC-LPS which do not aggregate. However, these may be relatively few given the strongly amphipathic nature of the lipid A moiety of LPS. Additionally, not all types of LPS, and not all LPS partial structures, have readily derivatizable groups in appropriate parts of the molecule. Indeed, we were unable to observe any fluorescence change when the FITC derivative of Escherichia coli 0111:B4 LPS bound to LBP (data not shown). Wistrom-Aurell et al.2( 2Wistrom-Aurell et al., manuscript submitted for publication. ) have observed that the fluorescein in the FITC derivative of E. coli 0111:B4 LPS is probably more distantly removed from the lipid a moiety than is the fluorescein in the FITC-LPS used here; thus self-quenching in that derivative is probably less pronounced. Nevertheless, the opportunity to make any real time, continuous measurement of even one LPS binding to LBP and sCD14 has considerable value. The reactions between FITC-LPS and other LPS binding proteins such as bactericidal/permeability increasing protein, cholesterol ester transport protein, and Limulus anti-lipopolysaccharide factor are currently under study and will be described elsewhere. We conclude that LBP catalyzes the reaction of LPS with sCD14 for the following reasons. If LBP were a stoichiometric partner in the final complexes formed, this should be visible in the sucrose density gradients of Fig. 2, but it is not. LBP should be labeled by [125I]ASD-LPS in the presence of any concentration of sCD14, but, as shown in Fig. 6, it is not. And if LBP is a component of the FITC·LPS·sCD14 complexes, the concentration of LBP should alter the apparent binding constant obtained when sCD14 is increased, but it does not. Thus three lines of evidence argue that LBP is not a constituent of the final complexes. Furthermore, Figs. 3 and 5 b show that LBP accelerates the reaction and that it delivers anywhere from 7 to nearly 500 molecules of FITC-LPS to sCD14. Thus LBP accelerates the reaction, LBP is not consumed in the reaction, and it does not perturb the final equilibrium. Thus we conclude that it is fair to claim that LBP acts as a catalyst in the reactions described. Two possible reaction pathways which are potentially consistent with the kinetic data for the reaction of aggregated FITC-LPS (FITC-LPSagg) with LBP are summarized in in reactions 1-4 of Fig. S1. If the pathway involving reactions 1 and 2 is operative, then LBP reacts with FITC-LPSagg followed by dissociation of complexes of LBP with monomeric FITC-LPS. In this sequence, reaction 2 would be the rate-limiting step since reaction 2 involves no change in the molecularity of the reaction and the rate of LPS·LBP complex formation was observed to be independent of the LBP concentration. If the alternative pathway involving reactions 3 and 4 is operative, monomers of FITC-LPS dissociate from the FITC-LPSagg and then react with LBP. In this sequence reaction 3 would be the rate-limiting step. Between these two pathways for LPS-LBP formation, we favor the upper pathway 1 and 2 primarily for the following reasons. The first is that complexes of LBP with LPS aggregates are directly observable in the sucrose density gradients. Complex formation via 3 and 4 does not involve any buildup of LBP bound to LPS aggregates since reaction 3 is rate-limiting. Second, if LBP reacted only with LPS monomers, because it has a higher affinity for LPS than does sCD14, LBP should inhibit the reaction of FITC-LPS with sCD14, not catalyze it. Undoubtedly there is some low equilibrium concentration of LPS monomers (21Din Z.Z. Mukerjee P. Kastowsky M. Takayama K. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 4579-4586Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) which could react directly either with LBP or sCD14. Presumably it is this pathway which provides for the spontaneous reaction of FITC-LPS with sCD14 with a rate constant of 1.7 × 10-4 s-1. Fig. 5, b and c, suggests that as the concentration of either protein changes, the overall reaction undergoes a change in rate-limiting step. This is typically observed when one step of a multistep reaction is subject to catalysis (22Jencks W.P. Catalysis in Chemistry and Enzymology. McGraw-Hill, New York1969Google Scholar). For example, given the foregoing discussion, in Fig. 5 c we propose that the rate-limiting step is “5” at low [sCD14] and “1” at high [sCD14]. Under this interpretation, the value observed for kexp,max from the data of both Fig. 5, b and c, should be approximately 4.2 × 10-2 s-1, i.e. the rate constant for dissociation of an FITC·LPS·LBP complex from FITC-LPSagg-LBP. The observed values are 8.9 × 10-2 s-1 and 6.6 × 10-2 s-1, respectively. Given the scatter in the data and the other vagaries in these reactions which we have experienced, we feel that theory and experiment are in acceptable agreement. Thus we conclude that the pathway for the formation of LPS·sCD14 complexes catalyzed by LBP is that which is shown in boldface in Fig. S1. Biologically, these results have several implications. As noted previously, recent work has suggested a catalytic role for LBP in assisting the presentation of LPS to sCD14 and that catalytic role is clearly supported by these results, as is the conclusion that sCD14 only binds a small number of LPS molecules (7Hailman E. Lichenstein H.S. Wurfel M.M. Miller D.S. Johnson D.A. Kelley M. Busse L.A. Zukowski M.M. Wright S.D. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 179: 269-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (617) Google Scholar). While one might wish to extrapolate and suggest that LBP also catalyzes the binding of LPS to mCD14 (7Hailman E. Lichenstein H.S. Wurfel M.M. Miller D.S. Johnson D.A. Kelley M. Busse L.A. Zukowski M.M. Wright S.D. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 179: 269-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (617) Google Scholar), i.e. CD14 on monocyte or neutrophil membranes, recent results from this laboratory show that LBP remains associated with mCD14 bearing cells when the cells are incubated with LPS·LBP complexes (16Gegner J.A. Ulevitch R.J. Tobias P.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5320-5325Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). Thus while LBP plays a catalytic role in the formation of LPS·sCD14 complexes for binding to non-mCD14 bearing cells, LBP does not have a strictly catalytic role in the presentation of LPS to mCD14 bearing cells. Hailman et al.(7Hailman E. Lichenstein H.S. Wurfel M.M. Miller D.S. Johnson D.A. Kelley M. Busse L.A. Zukowski M.M. Wright S.D. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 179: 269-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (617) Google Scholar) have shown that LPS·sCD14 complexes at 500 ng/ml LPS and 3 μg/ml sCD14 are agonists for neutrophils in the absence of LBP. However, Weingarten et al.(23Weingarten R. Sklar L.A. Mathison J.C. Omidi S. Simon S. Ulevitch R.J. Tobias P.S. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1993; 53: 518-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) have shown that 0.01 ng/ml LPS was a direct agonist for neutrophils in whole blood. Thus the presence of LBP can apparently make 4 orders of magnitude difference in the ability of LPS to activate neutrophils. Similar effects are seen with monocytes (24Mathison J.C. Tobias P.S. Wolfson E. Ulevitch R.J. J. Immunol. 1992; 149: 200-206PubMed Google Scholar) and this may be related to association of LBP with the cells. It is also known that the in vitro activation of peripheral blood monocytes is some 1000-fold more sensitive to LPS than is the activation of endothelial cells and it has been proposed that the LPS-sCD14 pathway for activation of LPS-sCD14-sensitive cells exposed to blood is probably secondary to their activation by LPS elicited monocyte derived cytokines (25Pugin J. Ulevitch R.J. Tobias P.S. J. Exp. Med. 1993; 178: 2193-2200Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). This hypothesis is supported by the measurements of KDfor FITC-LPS complexes of sCD14 and LBP; sCD14 binds FITC-LPS some 10-fold less tightly than LBP. The fact that FITC-LPS is actually transferred to sCD14 in our experiments despite the fact that sCD14 binds FITC-LPS some 10-fold less tightly than LBP is a result of the fact that sCD14 was present at much higher concentration than LBP. However, in serum (or plasma), LBP and sCD14 are normally present at roughly equal concentrations. One would thus predict that in serum, LPS would predominantly associate with LBP. During an acute-phase response, LBP concentrations are considerably elevated, more so than sCD14. Thus after an acute-phase response, the balance of LPS bound to LBP and sCD14 would shift further to LBP, further diminishing the ability of LPS to stimulate cells via the LPS-sCD14 pathway. Thus although an important role for LBP catalysis of LPS binding to sCD14 is readily demonstrable in vitro, the role of this reaction in vivo remains to be defined. Perhaps it will be found at extravascular sites of sCD14 synthesis where the ratio of sCD14:LBP could be quite different from plasma (26Fearns C. Loskutof D. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 181: 857-866Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar)."

Galactose 6-sulfate residues are found in the context of a novel structure, 6′-sulfo sLex, i.e. Siaα2→3SO4−6Galβ1→4(Fucα1→3)GlcNAc This structure is a major capping group of the O-linked chains of GlyCAM-1 and potentially accounts for all of the L-selectin binding requirements in a single structure (25Hemmerich S.

In the present study, we have undertaken a complete analysis of GlyCAM-1 to define the nature of the oligosaccharide core structures beneath the capping group.

We present complete structures for the simplest of the major O-linked chains and provide information about the more complex glycans. This new information raises a number of considerations for how recognition by L-selectin is achieved.

Wheat germ agglutinin-agarose (7 mg/ml gel) and peanut agglutinin-agarose (5 mg/ml gel) were purchased from Vector, Burlingame, CA. Hemoglobin and galactose 6-sulfate (Gal-6S) were from Sigma. In order to obtain radiolabeled alditol standards, 1.5 mg of chitooligosaccharide (a mixture of GlcNAcβ1→4 oligomers with n = 1–6, 0.25 mg of each oligomer, Seikagaku Co.) and in parallel, 1 mg of Galβ1→3GalNAc (Sigma) were each reacted with 1.5 mCi of [3H]NaBH4 (360 Ci/mol, DuPont NEN) in 100 µl of H2O for 3 h at 22 °C. Then, 100 µl of 2 M NaBH4 in 0.2 M NaOH was added to each sample. After a further 18 h at 22 °C, excess NaBH4 was decomposed with acetic acid and Na+ removed by passage over a cation exchange matrix (Dowex 50X-W4, H+form). The flow-through was lyophilized, evaporated once from methanol, 1% acetic acid, once from methanol alone, and then redissolved in 0.5 ml of H2O/sample. Specific activities of 9.3 × 107 cpm/mg of chitooligosaccharide-alditol and 1.25 × 108 cpm/mg of Galβ1→3GalNAc-ol were obtained. [14C]GlcNAcβ1→6[Galβ1→3]-GalNAc-ol (core-2-alditol, 2000 cpm in 50 µl of H2O) was a kind gift of Dr. I. Brockhausen (Toronto, Canada).

Unlabeled alditols of Galβ1→3GalNAc, Galβ1→3GlcNAc, Galβ1→4GlcNAc, and Galβ1→6GlcNAc were obtained by dissolving 1 mg of the respective disaccharide (all from Sigma) in 50 µl of 1 M NaBH4, 0.1 M NaOH followed by 18 h of incubation at 22 °C. Each sample was neutralized with 3 µl of glacial acetic acid and diluted with H2O to 5 ml (0.2 mg alditol/ml ≍ 0.6 mM) for use as standards in high pH anion-exchange chromatography (HPAEC). Synthetic Galβ1→4(SO4-6)GlcNAc was generously provided by Dr. K. Matta (Roswell Park Cancer Institute, Buffalo, NY). Mouse peripheral and mesenteric lymph nodes were labeled in organ culture with D-[6-3H]galactose, D-[6-3H]glucosamine, or D-[2-3H]mannose (DuPont NEN), and GlyCAM-1 was immunoprecipitated from conditioned media with CAM02 antibody immobilized on protein A-agarose (Zymed, South San Francisco, CA) as described earlier (24Hemmerich S.

In order to generate undersulfated GlyCAM-1, metabolic labeling was carried out under the same conditions in the presence of 10 mM sodium chlorate in a mixture of 90% sulfate-free and 10% standard medium (RPMI 1640). Incorporation of label into the immunoprecipitates (lymph nodes from 2.5 mice and 0.5 mCi of precursor) was as follows: The binding of undersulfated or normal [3H]Gal-labeled GlyCAM-1, without or with prior desialylation (A. ureafaciens sialidase), to immobilized wheat germ agglutinin, immobilized PNA, or CAM05-derivatized protein A matrix was determined as described previously (25Hemmerich S.

[3H]GlcN-labeled GlyCAM, which was eluted from the CAM02 antibody matrix into 200 µl of Tris-buffered saline with 1 mg/ml pep2 (TBS, 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl) was reacted for 18 h at 37 °C with 50 milliunits of A. ureafaciens sialidase, added in 200 µl of 50 mM sodium acetate, pH 5.3, 100 mM NaCl. The desialylated GlyCAM-1 was then desalted and separated from free [3H]sialic acid by passage over a Sephadex G-25 column (250 mm × 10 mm) equilibrated in 0.5 M NH4HCO3, 5% 2-propanol. The radioactivity in the void volume was pooled, lyophilized, and redissolved in 1 М NaBH4, 0.1 М NaOH for β-elimination of O-linked glycans. Linked Chains (Glycans) from GlyCAM-1—O-Glycans were liberated from immunoprecipitated [3H]Gal-labeled or [3H]Fuclabeled GlyCAM-1 or from desialylated [3H]GlcN-labeled GlyCAM-1 by treatment with NaBH4 in NaOH as described previously (26Imai Y. Rosen S.D. Glycoconj. J. 1993; 10: 34-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) and redissolved in 50 µl of H2O. Linked Chains from GlyCAM-1—O-Glycans from [3H]Gal-labeled or [3H]Fuc-labeled GlyCAM-1 in 50 µl of H2O were reacted with 25 milliunits of A. ureafaciens sialidase added in 50 µl of 50 mM acetate, pH 5.3, 100 mM NaCl, for 18 h at 37 °C. The desialylated chains, or β-eliminated chains from desialylated [3H]GlcN-GlyCAM-l, were loaded onto parallel DEAE-Sepharose columns (Sigma, HCOO– form, 80 × 5 mm, bed volume: 1.6 ml) equilibrated in 2 mM pyridine-formate, pH 3.0. The columns were each eluted with 13.5 ml of 2 mM pyridine formate, pH 3.0, followed by a linear gradient (70 ml) of 2–1000 mM pyridine-formate, pH 3. Fractions (0.85 ml) were collected, aliquots were mixed with 5 ml of Ultima Gold scintillation mixture (Packard, Downers Grove, IL), and counted in a Beckman LS-8000 liquid scintillation counter. The flow-through (first three fractions) from undersulfated material was defined as uncharged, and was lyophilized and redissolved in 50 µl of H2O for further analysis. Fractions constituting peak A (55 mM pyridine formate) (Fig. 9) were pooled, lyophilized, and redissolved in 25 µl of H2O for further analysis. The samples to be fractionated (100 µl) were supplemented with 30 µl of 2.5% hemoglobin in 0.1 M pyridine-acetate, pH 5.4, and 30 µl of 100 mM Gal-6S in H2O and loaded onto parallel columns of Bio-Gel P4 (200–400 mesh, Bio-Rad, 112 × 1 cm, bed volume: 88 ml) equilibrated in 0.1 м pyridine-acetate, pH 5.4. The column was eluted at 22 °C with the same pyridine-acetate buffer at a rate of 5 ml/h. The elution volume was measured relative to the time of sample application. 30-drop fractions (0.79–0.83 ml) were collected. The columns were standardized with 70,000 cpm of (GlcNAcβ1→4)-n-1[1-3H]GlcNAc-ol (n = 1 to 6), 25,000 cpm of Galβ1→3[l-3H]GalNAc-ol (see above), and 25,000 cpm of [3H]galactose. Unless specified otherwise, entire fractions 33 through 95 were counted as above. The hemoglobin standard, which defined the void volume (Vo), eluted at 28.4 ml (fraction 34). For identification of Gal-6S, which eluted as the most included standard at 83.7 ml, 0.5-ml aliquots of fractions 96–108 were subjected to the phenol-sulfuric acid assay (27Dubois M. Gilles K.A. Hamilton J.K. Rebers P.A. Smith F. Anal. Chem. 1956; 28: 350-356Crossref Scopus (41197) Google Scholar). Since the number of drops/unit of volume underwent minor fluctuations between parallel columns and different experiments, the elution profiles were compared to each other and to the standardization by overlay of their respective hemoglobin and Gal-6S markers and mathematical calculation of the actual average fraction volume ∆V as (VGal-6s-Vo)/(fGal-6s – fo) with VGal-6s-Vo = 55.3 ml (see above) and fGal-6s – fo being the number of fractions between the hemoglobin and Gal-6S peaks. 2.5 µl (5% of total) of peaks I, II, and III from size fractionation of desialylated unsulfated O-glycans, labeled in [3H]Gal (Fig. 3), were digested with 2.5 microunits in 10 µl final volume of α(1→3/4)fucosidase in buffer A (50 mM sodium-cacodylate, pH 6.0, 0.05% bovine serum albumin, 0.05% NaN3, 0.125% Triton X-100) for 48 h at 37 °C. Parallel control samples were incubated in buffer A alone. Digests and control were directly subjected to HPAEC. All digestions were carried out by incubation (48 h, 37 °C) of samples with enzyme(s) in a final volume of 100 µl of buffer A. A. ureafaciens sialidase was used at 0.25 units/ml. D. pneumoniae β(1→4)galactosidase and β-N-acetylglucosaminidase were used at 50 and 100 milliunits/ml, respectively. Streptomyces sp. 142 α(1→3/4)fucosidase was used at 50 microunits/ml. E. freundii endo-β-galactosidase was used at 0.1 units/ml. Digestions with jack bean β-galactosidase were carried out at 0.25 units/ml in 100 µl of 20 mM NaH2PO4 (buffered to pH 3.5 with acetic acid) for 12 h at 37 °C. Digests and parallel controls were then subjected to gel filtration through Bio-Gel P4 as described above. Parallel samples of Galβ1→4(SO4-6)GlcNAc (1 mM) were incubated either with D. pneumoniae β(1→4)galactosidase (0.1 unit/ml) in buffer A or jack bean β-galactosidase (0.25 unit/ml) in 20 mм NaH2PO4, pH 3.5, for 12 h at 37 °C. Digests and parallel controls were then subjected to HPAEC. Samples were lyophilized, each redissolved in 1 ml of 50 mм HC1 in anhydrous methanol, and incubated 24 h at 37 °C. The solvent was evaporated under an argon stream, residues were dried overnight in vacuo, and redissolved in 200 µl of water. These were passed over parallel DEAE anion exchange columns (HCOO– form, 80 mm × 5 mm), equilibrated in 2 mM pyridine-formate, pH 3. Each column was washed with 5 ml of H2O. Flow-through and wash were pooled, lyophilized, and redissolved in 25 µl of water for HPAEC. O-Linked chains obtained by β-elimination (with concomitant reduction) were fractionated by HPAEC using a Carbopac Alditol Prototype column (250 mm × 4 mm) from Dionex (Sunnyvale, CA), which was kindly provided by Dr. R. Townsend (University of California, San Francisco). Each sample was injected in 25 µl of water. The column was eluted (flow rate 0.4 ml/min) isocratically for 5 min with 100 mM NaOH, then from 5 to 35 min with a linear gradient of 100–700 mM NaOH, and finally for 15 min isocratically with 700 mM NaOH. Standards were used at 0.25 mM and analyzed by pulsed amperometric detection. Radiolabeled products were detected by collecting 0.5 min (0.2 ml) fractions followed by liquid scintillation analysis as described above. β-Galactosidase digests of Galβ1→4(SO4-6)GlcNAc (1 mM substrate, see above) were injected (25 µl) into a Carbopac PA1 column (Dionex, 250 mm × 4 mm) and eluted (1 ml/min) for 5 min isocratically with 50 mM sodium acetate, 150 mM NaOH, and then from 5 to 35 min with a linear gradient of 50–850 mM sodium acetate in 150 mM NaOH. Eluting carbohydrates were detected by pulsed amperometric detection. Galactose and N-acetylglucosamine-6-sulfate (V-labs, Covington, LA) were used as standards at 0.4 mM. The goal of this study was to define the structures of the simplest O-linked glycans in GlyCAM-1. To obtain radiolabeled chains for this analysis, mouse lymph nodes were metabolically labeled in organ culture with [3H]Gal, [3H]GlcN, or [3H]Man, and GlyCAM-1 was immunoprecipitated from conditioned medium with a peptide-directed antibody as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The label from the [6-3H]galactose precursor is known to be incorporated into galactose units, and the [6-3H]glucosamine precursor is converted into GalNAc, GlcNAc, and sialic acid (28Varki A. FASEB J. 1991; 5: 226-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Reflecting the absence of N-linked chains within GlyCAM-1, the label from the [2-3H]mannose precursor is incorporated exclusively into fucosyl residues (24Hemmerich S. Bertozzi C.R. Leffler H. Rosen S.D. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 4820-4829Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Undersulfated GlyCAM-1 was obtained by immunoprecipitating lymph nodes that were cultured in the presence of chlorate, a highly selective metabolic inhibitor of sulfation (29Rapraeger A.C. Krufka A. Olwin B.B. Science. 1991; 252: 1705-1708Crossref PubMed Scopus (1292) Google Scholar). After metabolic labeling, the O-linked chains of GlyCAM-1 were obtained by standard β-elimination conditions (26Imai Y. Rosen S.D. Glycoconj. J. 1993; 10: 34-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Chain analysis was performed by digestion with glycosidases followed by analysis of the fragments by gel filtration and HPAEC. PNA, a lectin which preferentially recognizes the T-antigen, i.e. Galβ1→3GalNAc (30Lotan R. Skutelsky E. Danon D. Sharon N. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 8518-8523Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), was used to probe for the presence of this structure within GlyCAM-1. Both normal and undersulfated GlyCAM-1, labeled in [3H]Gal, were examined for their binding to PNA-agarose before and after desialylation. It is known that binding of PNA to the T-antigen is not impaired by sialylation at the 6-position of GalNAc but is blocked by α(2→3) sialylation of Gal (31Boland C.R. Chen Y.-F. Rinderle S.J. Resau J.H. Luk G.D. Lynch H.T. Goldstein I.J. Cancer Res. 1991; 51: 657-665PubMed Google Scholar). Fully sialylated GlyCAM-1 did not bind to PNA, whereas desialylated GlyCAM-1 was recognized (Table I). This result suggested the possibility that GlyCAM-1 contains sialylated Galβ1→3GalNAc. We have previously shown that treatment of GlyCAM-1 with Newcastle disease virus sialidase, an enzyme with specificity for the α(2→3) linkage of sialic acid, almost completely abrogates binding of GlyCAM-1 to the Sia-specific lectin, Limax flavus agglutinin (25Hemmerich S. Rosen S.D. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 4830-4835Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Taken together, these results suggest that Siaα2→3Galβ1→3GalNAc is present within GlyCAM-1.Table IBinding of GlyCAM-1 to peanut agglutinin is sialidase-dependent Sulfation of monosaccharides in glycans is known to interfere with the ability of exoglycosidases to hydrolyze these units from oligosaccharide chains (25Hemmerich S. Rosen S.D. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 4830-4835Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar, 32Green E.D. Baenziger J.U. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 25-35Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 33Spiro R.G. Bhoyroo V.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 14351-14358Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, we employed undersulfated GlyCAM-1 for our initial studies. Previously, we (24Hemmerich S. Bertozzi C.R. Leffler H. Rosen S.D. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 4820-4829Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar) showed that chlorate reduces sulfate incorporation into GlyCAM-1 by 90%, while [3H]Gal and [3H]glucosamine incorporation are changed only slightly (see “Experimental Procedures”). Moreover, the overall sialylation and fucosylation of the molecule, as measured by specific lectin affinity chromatography, are not significantly altered (18Hemmerich S. Butcher E.C. Rosen S.D. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 180: 2219-2226Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar, 19Imai Y. Lasky L.A. Rosen S.D. Nature. 1993; 361: 555-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar, 25Hemmerich S. Rosen S.D. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 4830-4835Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Our previous work also demonstrated that both enzymatic degalactosylation and defucosylation of GlyCAM-1 are strictly dependent on concomitant desialylation, and that release of galactose by β(1→4)galactosidase is greatly enhanced by defucosylation (25Hemmerich S. Rosen S.D. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 4830-4835Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Guided by these results, we isolated O-linked chains from undersulfated GlyCAM-1 ([3H]Gal-labeled) and subjected these glycans to the combined action of D. pneumoniae (Dp) exo-β(l→4)galactosidase, Dp exo-β-N-acetylglu-cosaminidase, Streptomyces α(1→3/4)fucosidase plus or minus A. ureafaciens (Au) sialidase. Without sialidase, only trace levels of free Gal were released (Fig. 1). However, with sialidase present, all of the [3H]Gal label was found shifted into smaller fragments and free galactose (Fig. 1). We conclude from these experiments that virtually all of the Galβ1→4 residues of GlyCAM-1 must be capped by sialic acid. From previous results (25Hemmerich S. Rosen S.D. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 4830-4835Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar) obtained with the Newcastle disease virus sialidase and the Sia linkage-specific lectin, Maackia amurensis agglutinin, the linkage of sialic acid to Galβ1→4 is inferred to be α2→3. As shown in Fig. 1, the combined action of sialidase, β(1→4)galactosidase, β-N-acetylglucosaminidase, and α(1→3/4)fucosidase converted the O-glycans from [3H]Gal-GlyCAM-1 into three species: 1) free Gal (55%), 2) a peak that coeluted with Galβ1→3GalNAc-ol (20%, designated #), and 3) larger fragments (25%). These latter species may represent incompletely digested oligosaccharides (see below). O-Glycans were also isolated from GlyCAM-1 that was metabolically labeled with [3H]GlcN. Since this precursor labels sialic acid residues, the glycoprotein was desialylated, and free sialic acid was removed by gel filtration prior to β-elimination. Sialic acid accounted for 34% of the total [3H]GlcN-derived label. The saccharide chains released from the desialylated [3H]GlcN-GlyCAM-1 were digested with a mixture of β(1→4)galactosidase, β-N-acetylglucosaminidase, and α(1→3/4)fucosidase as above. This treatment produced two main peaks, one that coeluted on the P4 column with free GlcNAc and the other with Galβ1→3GalNAc-ol (not shown). If β(1→4)galactosidase was omitted from the digestion mixture, no free GlcNAc was released, indicating that all GlcNAc was subterminal with respect to Galβ1→4. The next step was to identify the structure of the apparent disaccharide coeluting with Galβ1→3GalNAc-ol (peak #, Fig. 1). This material was subjected, along with authentic standards, to HPAEC on a column designed for fractionation of alditols. As shown in Fig. 2, the component eluted from the HPAEC column with Galβ1→3GalNAc-ol and was clearly differentiated from Galβ1→3GlcNAc-ol, Galβ1→4GlcNAc-ol, and Galβ1→6Glc-NAc-ol. Based on this finding, the presence of label from both [3H]Gal and [3H]GlcN in this peak, the elution of the peak in gel filtration, and the PNA-binding results, we assign the disaccharide under peak # as the alditol of Galβ1→3GalNAc (T-disaccharide). We have recently shown that chlorate treatment dramatically increases (from 32 to 80%) the fraction of uncharged chains derived from desialylated GlyCAM-1 (24Hemmerich S. Bertozzi C.R. Leffler H. Rosen S.D. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 4820-4829Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). The residual charge, which is presumably due to incomplete suppression of sulfation, may account for the incomplete glycosidase digestion seen in Fig. 1. To obtain neutral O-glycans, chains were β-eliminated from undersulfated-desialylated GlyCAM-1 (labeled with [3H]Gal, [3H]GlcN or [3H]Man) and passed through DEAE-Sepharose anion-exchange resin. The neutral (desialylated and unsulfated) chains in the flow-through were then subjected to gel filtration on Bio-Gel P4. As shown in Fig. 3, the glycans fractionated into three distinct populations: peak I centered at 55 ml, peak II centered at 47.5 ml, and peak III centered at 43 ml. The widths and asymmetries of the three peaks suggested microheterogeneity within each population. All three populations contained galactose (derived from [3H]Gal), GlcNAc/GalNAc (derived from [3H]GlcN), and fucose (derived from [3H]Man). The oligosaccharides of P4-peak I (Fig. 3), with label derived from either [3H]Gal or [3H]GlcN, were digested with β(1→4)galactosidase and α(1→3/4)fucosidase with or without N-acetylglu-cosaminidase. Each digest plus an undigested control sample were resubjected to gel filtration thro"

Current genetic and biochemical evidence is compatible with the idea that BCR clustering initially stimulates the membrane-associated Src PTKs resulting in their phosphorylation of Igα and Igβ ITAM tyrosines. The Igα and Igβ tyrosine phosphorylations then serve as membrane proximal binding sites for the tandem Src homology 2 (SH2) domains present in the amino-terminal portion of Syk. During this process Syk is enzymatically activated and tyrosine-phosphorylated. However, the mechanism responsible for the enzymatic activation of Syk is not known. Thus, it is unresolved whether Syk association with the tyrosine-phosphorylated ITAMs, Syk tyrosine phosphorylation, or merely Syk approximation to the plasma membrane account for noted changes in Syk enzyme activity that accompany BCR ligation. Here, we provide evidence that the tandemly phosphorylated ITAMs of the BCR signal coupling Igα and Igβ subunits can activate the enzyme activity of Syk as much as 10-fold in vitro. The mechanism underlying phospho-ITAM-induced Syk enzymatic activation appears to be a function of Syk autophosphorylation. These observations imply that it is the association of Syk with the tyrosine-phosphorylated Igα and/or Igβ ITAMs in B cells that results in Syk autophosphorylation leading to the enhanced specific activity of the Syk PTK. BAL17 (mature IgM+ IgD+) murine B cells were grown in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 5 × 10∼5 M 2-mercaptoethanol, and 2 mM l-glutamine. For BCR activation studies, 1 × 107 cells were treated with 10 μg of goat anti-mouse IgM (anti-μ) (Sigma) for the indicated times and lysed as previously indicated (8Saouaf S.J. Mahajan S. Rowley R.B. Kut S.A. Fargnoli J. Burkhardt A.L. Tsukada S. Witte O.N. Bolen J.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 9524-9528Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). COS-7 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. For Syk production, 2 × 106 COS-7 cells were transfected with 10 μg of pSVHASyk plasmid DNA in 25 μl of Lipofectamine (Life Technologies, Inc.) and the cells harvested 48 h later. Rabbit antisera to Syk and murine Igα as well as the murine monoclonal anti-phosphotyrosine (APT) antibody 5H1 have been previously described (17Burkhardt A.L. Stealey B. Rowley R.B. Mahajan S. Prendergast M. Fargnoli J. Bolen J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23642-23647Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Monoclonal antibody 12CA5 (anti-HA) to the influenza virus hemagglutinin (HA) epitope was obtained from BAbCo. Immunoprecipitations, immune complex protein kinase assays, and immunobloting were all conducted as described previously (18Burkhardt A.L. Bolen J.B. Coligan J.E. Kruisbeek A.M. Margulies D.H. Shevach E.M. Strober W. Current Protocola in Immunology. Vol. 11.4. John Wiley & Sons, New York1993: 1-18Google Scholar). Quantitation of the phosphorylated reaction products was performed by analysis with a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager using ImageQuant software. The rat Syk open reading frame (19Rowley R.B. Bolen J.B. Fargnoli J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270 (in press)Google Scholar) was subcloned into COS expression vector pSV7c (20Adam D. Klages S. Bishop P. Mahajan S. Escobedo J.A. Bolen J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19882-19888Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For production of HA-tagged Syk, the 5′ oligonucleotide used for PCR subcloning included a methionine initiation codon and the codons for the HA sequence YPYDVPDYA. The final construct yielded HA-Syk in which the HA tag was incorporated immediately prior the normal Syk initiation codon. The Syk double point mutant 2R was constructed by making arginine to alanine point mutations in the Syk SH2 domains (R41A in the first SH2 and R194A in the second SH2) using the p-Alter system (Promega). These mutations abolished all detectable binding of Igα or Igβ ITAM phosphopeptides to 2R (data not shown). Phosphopeptides were prepared using Fmoc (N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl) chemistry employing a solid-phase strategy. Crude peptides were obtained by treating peptidyl-resin samples with trifluoroacetic acid containing phenol or thiocresol and were purified by reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography using a C-18 bonded column with trifluoroacetic acid/acetonitrile/water. The peptides and phosphopeptides utilized for these studies were determined to be monomeric by FPLC Superose 12 chromatography. Peptide identity was confirmed by fast atom bombardment mass spectrometry and amino acid analysis. The results presented in Fig. 1 demonstrate following anti-μ-induced BCR cross-linking that the specific activity of Syk was stimulated severalfold (right panels) and correlated with an increase in Syk tyrosine phosphorylation (second panel on left) over that found in untreated cells. The activation of Syk enzyme activity was reflected by both the capacity of Syk to support elevated tyrosine autophosphorylation (4–6-fold activation; Fig. 1, right panels) and to phosphorylate exogenous substrates such as rabbit muscle enolase (4-fold activation; Fig. 1, right side, lower panel). Phosphoamino acid analysis detected only phosphotyrosine as the products of these immune complex protein kinase assays (data not shown). As previously found in WEHI 231 B cells (8Saouaf S.J. Mahajan S. Rowley R.B. Kut S.A. Fargnoli J. Burkhardt A.L. Tsukada S. Witte O.N. Bolen J.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 9524-9528Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar), we did not detect other PTKs co-immunoprecipitating with Syk in these assays. The change in Syk specific activity observed correlated with the association of Syk with tyrosine-phosphorylated BCR subunits (Fig. 1, left two bottom panels). While the association of Syk with the BCR in this case was monitored by immunoprecipitating Iga, similar complexes were found using antibodies directed against Igβ. Since Igα and Igβ exist primarily as disulfide-linked heterodimers (21Hombach J. Tsubata T. Leclercq L. Stappert H. Reth M. Nature. 1990; 343: 760-762Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar, 22Camphell K.S. Cambier J.C. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 441-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 23Hombach J. Lottspeich F.

A. 1991; 88: 3982-3986Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), we could not distinguish whether Syk preferentially associated with the tyrosine-phosphorylated a or β subunits. In order to evaluate the contributions of tyrosine phosphorylation and phospho-Iga/Igβ binding to Syk kinase activity, a source of Syk was needed that lacked tyrosine phosphorylation and one in which antibody binding was displaced from locations potentially interfering with functional analyses. A solution to these problems was found by transient expression of HA-tagged Syk in COS-7 cells. Expression of HA-Syk in COS-7 cells resulted in the production of enzyme that lacked detectable tyrosine phosphorylation in vivo (Fig. 2A) but was capable of tyrosine autophosphorylation in anti-HA immune complexes (Fig. 2B). In separate experiments, we determined by tryptic peptide analysis that the autophosphorylation products of anti-Syk immunoprecipitates of HA-Syk derived from COS-7 cells and Syk derived from B cells were indistinguishable (data not shown). To determine whether Syk autophosphorylation affected Syk enzymatic activity, HA-Syk was immunoprecipitated from COS-7 cells and incubated with 1 mM ATP and 5 mM MnCl2 from 30 s to 1 h. Representative samples from the control (no preincubation) and HA-Syk incubated for 30 min with ATP/Mn2+ were then used for immune complex protein kinase assays using enolase as an exogenous substrate. The results of these experiments show that tyrosine phosphorylation of HA-Syk increased as a function of reaction time (Fig. 2C, bottom panel) and correlated with diminished electrophoretic mobility of HA-Syk in SDS gels (Fig. 2C, top panel). As shown in Fig. 2D, autophosphorylation of HA-Syk resulted in an approximately 10-fold increase in the specific activity of the enzyme toward the enolase substrate. In other experiments we found that maximal activation of HA-Syk was obtained by 5 min of preincubation with ATP/Mn2+ at a point prior to detectable shifts in HA-Syk gel mobility (data not shown). Phosphorylated Igβ and Igα ITAMs Stimulate Syk Specific Activity—HA-Syk was incubated with 25 μΜ peptide or phosphopeptide (for sequences see Fig. 3) for 15 min. Kinase buffer containing enolase was then added and the reactions allowed to continue for one minute. The results of this experiment (Fig. 4) show that Syk kinase specific activity as measured by autophosphorylation or phosphorylation of enolase was maximally activated (8–10-fold) by the diphosphorylated Igβ or Igα peptides. The results shown in Fig. 5 (panels A, D, and E) demonstrate that Syk activation by βdiP was peptide concentration-dependent (maximum = 20 μM; half-maximal = 5 μΜ) and that addition of βdiP at 25 μΜ significantly stimulated the rate of Syk autophosphorylation (Fig. 5, panels B and F) and phosphorylation of the enolase exogenous substrate (Fig. 5, panels C and G). The non-phosphorylated (a or β) had no detectable effects on Syk kinase activity (FIG. 4, FIG. 5). Monophosphorylated peptides showed differential capacities to modulate Syk kinase activity (Fig. 4). The peptide representing the Igβ ITAM with phosphotyrosine in the first position (peptide β1P) had no detectable Syk stimulating activity, while the same peptide with phosphotyrosine in the second position (peptide β2P) stimulated in some, but not all assays, Syk autophosphorylation and enolase phosphorylation approximately 2-fold. The phosphorylated half-ITAMs β1/2-1P and β1/2–2P alone or in combination were found to stimulate Syk kinase activity by as much as 3-fold. Increasing the β2Ρ, β1/2-IΡ, β1/2–2P, or β1/2-1P + β1/2–2P peptide concentrations did not further stimulate Syk kinase activity (data not shown).FIG. 4Effect of ITAM peptides and phosphopeptides on Syk protein kinase activity.

Moreover, the results show that autoactivated wild-type Syk was incapable of being further activated by addition of Igβ diP. In similar experiments, Igα diP gave the same results (data not shown). In agreement with several previous studies analyzing the involvement of Syk in BCR responses, the results presented in this report demonstrate in B cells that Syk enzyme activity is stimulated following BCR ligation (Fig. 1). The elevation in Syk specific activity correlated with increased tyrosine phosphorylation of Syk as well as the association of Syk with the tyrosine-phosphorylated Igα and Igβ subunits of the BCR (Fig. 1). In the present study we sought to dissect the relative contributions of phospho-ITAM binding and enzyme tyrosine phosphorylation to the regulation of Syk protein kinase activity. In our analysis HA epitope-tagged Syk was expressed in COS-7 cells to produce Syk molecules that, in contrast to Syk obtained from hemopoietic cell sources, lacked detectable tyrosine phosphorylation (Fig. 2). HA-Syk also possessed an antibody binding site in a defined location distinct from the enzyme functional domains. Using this expression system, we found that the specific activity of Syk could be increased either by autophosphorylation (FIG. 2, FIG. 6) or by addition of diphosphorylated peptide representing the Igα or Igβ ITAM (FIG. 4, FIG. 5). Syk autophosphorylation was found to stimulate enzyme specific activity by as much as 10-fold (FIG. 2, FIG. 6). Since the double SH2 mutant 2R was as equally activated as wild-type Syk following autophosphorylation (Fig. 6), it appears that intramolecular phosphotyrosine-SH2 interactions are not involved in the activation process. Two-dimensional tryptic peptide analysis of the autophosphorylation reactions products revealed a pattern consistent with the presence of several distinct phosphorylation sites (data not shown). Site-specific tyrosine to phenylalanine mutation of several individual candidate sites including tyrosines 130, 317, 342, 345, 519, 520, 623, 624, and 625 did not prohibit autophosphorylation-induced Syk activation in vitro (data not shown). These results suggest there may be multiple sites of phosphorylation leading to in vitro Syk activation. In contrast to non-phosphorylated peptides, biphosphoryl-ated peptides (αdiP and βdiP) corresponding to the Igα and Igβ ITAMs were found to be capable of maximally stimulating Syk protein kinase activity by approximately 10-fold (FIG. 4, FIG. 6). These phosphorylated peptides had no detectable effect on the Syk double SH2 mutant, demonstrating the dependence of functional Syk SH2s in this process (Fig. 6). In other experiments mutation of either SH2 domain was found to yield enzymes with the same phenotype as that of the double SH2 mutant (data not shown). These results suggest that both Syk SH2 domains are required for αdiP- and βdiP-dependent Syk activation. Additional support for this idea was provided by experiments showing that monophosphorylated Igβ ITAM peptides were found to have little or no stimulatory capacity. Furthermore, it is clear that for maximum Syk stimulation the two phosphotyrosines need to be present on the same peptide, since addition of phosphopeptides representing the 1/2 ITAMs (β1/2–1Ρ and β1/2–2P) alone or in combination led to maximal Syk activation of only 3-fold (Fig. 4). Our results show that the αdiP and βdiP phosphopeptides were not capable of further stimulating the activity of auto-phosphorylation-activated Syk (Fig. 6). These observations support the concept that the mechanism underlying αdiP and βdiP stimulation of Syk may be linked to the induction of conformational changes leading to enhanced Syk autophosphorylation. This possibility is supported by results demonstrating that βdiP binding to Syk significantly accelerates the rate of Syk autophosphorylation. These observations are consistent with the idea that Syk autophosphorylation is a major factor in regulating Syk protein kinase activity. These in vitro results lead to the proposal that tandem SH2 mediated binding of Syk to tyrosine-phosphorylated ITAMs in cells elevates the rate of Syk autophosphorylation, resulting in an increase in Syk specific activity and promoting the tyrosine phosphorylation of Syk substrates. Clearly, other PTKs capable of phosphorylating Syk autophosphorylation sites could participate in this process (25Kurosaki T. Takata M. Yamanashi Y. Inazu T. Taniguchi T. Yamamoto T. Yamamura H. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 179: 1725-1729Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar).

https://openalex.org/W2067884008,"Engagement of the high affinity receptor for immunoglobulin E (FcϵRI) on the surface of mast cells induces tyrosine phosphorylation of numerous cellular proteins. Syk, one of several non-receptor protein tyrosine kinases implicated in FcϵRI signaling, is activated following receptor cross-linking and associates with phosphorylated γ subunits of FcϵRI. We previously showed that the Src homology 2 (SH2) domains of Syk bind with high affinity to the conserved tyrosine-based activation motif (TAM) of the γ subunit <i>in vitro</i>. In this report, we show that a tyrosine-phosphorylated γ TAM peptide induced tyrosine phosphorylation of Syk in RBL-2H3 cell lysates and stimulated Syk kinase activity 10-fold <i>in vitro</i>, with half-maximal activation at 1-2 μM. A similar β subunit TAM peptide showed much lower stimulation of Syk tyrosine phosphorylation and kinase activity. Phosphopeptide-induced activation was inhibited by an antiserum to the carboxyl-terminal tail of Syk, suggesting that those amino acids are also involved in Syk activation. These results indicate that the catalytic domain of Syk may be regulated by intramolecular interactions with adjacent domains and suggest that Syk binding to phosphorylated γ subunits following FcϵRI engagement <i>in vivo</i> stimulates Syk kinase activity."

Cell. 1993; 75: 1179-1186Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (643) Google Scholar). COS cells co-transfected with PSGL-1 and a(l,3/4)fucosyltransferase cDNAs express a homodimer of –240 kDa and support leukocyte adhesion in a P-selectin-dependent manner. We have previously reported the development of a panel of monoclonal antibodies which recognize an ∼240-kDa molecule from human neutrophils and HL-60 cells and inhibit adhesion of these cells to P-selectin (10Ma L. Raycroft L. Asa D. Anderson D.C. Geng J.-G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27739-27746Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These results strongly suggest that the 240-kDa molecule is a leukocyte ligand for P-selectin. A number of leukocyte ligands from various species have been described for P- and E-selectin. E-selectin, but not P-selectin, recognizes an ∼150-kDa monomelic glycoprotein from mouse myeloid cells metabolically labeled with [35S]methionine and [35S]cysteine (11Levinovitz A. Muhlhoff J. Isenmann S. Vestweber D. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 449-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar, 12Lenter M. Levinovitz A. Isenmann S. Vestweber D. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 471-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). This binding is Ca2+-dependent and can be blocked by an antibody to mouse E-selectin. In contrast, the mature mouse neutrophils contain glycoproteins of 230 kDa and 130 kDa, which bind to both P- and E-selectins in a Ca2+-dependent, sialidase-sensitive fashion (12Lenter M. Levinovitz A. Isenmann S. Vestweber D. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 471-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). A single glycoprotein (250 kDa under nonreducing conditions and 280 kDa under reducing conditions), isolated from bovine γ/δ T cells, binds to human E-selectin in a Ca2+-dependent, sialidase-sensitive manner (13Walcheck B. Watts G. Jutila M.A. J. Exp. Med. 1993; 178: 853-863Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Furthermore, P-selectin, but not E-selectin, recognizes an ∼160-kDa monomelic glycoprotein from mature mouse neutrophils and human HL-60 cells (12Lenter M. Levinovitz A. Isenmann S. Vestweber D. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 471-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). There are some experimental results which suggest that the P-selectin glycoprotein ligand might function as a ligand for E-selectin. First, the conditioned medium from COS cells cotransfected with both the truncated soluble form of PSGL-1 and α(1,3/4)fucosyltransferase cDNAs mediates adhesion to radiolabeled CHO-P-selectin cells and CHO-E-selectin cells. In both cases, the cell adhesion is Ca2+-dependent and inhibitable with respective neutralizing antibodies (9Sako D. Chang X.-J. Barone K.M. Vachino G. White H.M. Shaw G. Veldman G.M. Bean K.M. Ahern T.J. Furie B. Cumming D.A. Larsen G.R. Cell. 1993; 75: 1179-1186Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (643) Google Scholar). Second, 125I-PSGL-1 from human neutrophils binds directly to truncated soluble forms of P- and E-selectins in a Ca2+-dependent manner (8Moore K.L. Eaton S.F. Lyons D.E. Lichenstein H.S. Cummings R.D. McEver R.P. J Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23318-23327Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, the binding affinity for E-selectin (IC50 ∼25 μΜ) is at least 50-fold weaker than that for P-selectin (IC50 ∼ 0.5 μM). Taken together, these results suggest that E-selectin recognizes several glycoproteins with different molecular masses including ∼130-kDa, ∼150-kDa, and ∼230-kDa monomeric molecules in mouse neutrophils, an ∼250-kDa monomeric molecule from bovine γ/δ T cells, and an ∼240-kDa dimeric molecule (P-selectin glycoprotein ligand) from human neutrophils and HL-60 cells (8Moore K.L.

However, it is not known whether the P-selectin glycoprotein ligand is the only high affinity ligand recognized by E-selectin in human neutrophils and HL-60 cells. Moreover, the biological importance of the P-selectin glycoprotein ligand on the cell surface of human neutrophils and HL-60 cells as a ligand in E-selectin-mediated leukocyte adhesion remains unclear. In the present study, we show that only one radiolabeled glycoprotein is purified specifically by E-selectin Rg affinity chromatography. The molecular mass and O-linked carbohydrate profile of this molecule are identical with those of the P-selectin glycoprotein ligand isolated by P-selectin affinity chromatography. This molecule is recognized by PL5 mAb, E-selectin Rg, and PSGL-1 antiserum. Furthermore, PL5, a monoclonal IgM antibody raised against the P-selectin ligand (10Ma L. Raycroft L. Asa D. Anderson D.C. Geng J.-G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27739-27746Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), also blocks adhesion of human neutrophils and HL-60 cells to E-selectin. Thus, our results suggest that this glycoprotein is an important human leukocyte ligand for both P- and E-selectins.

Vestweber D. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 449-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). P-selectin Rg was prepared as described previously.2 E-selectin Rglthe lectin-epidermal growth factor-repeat domains 1 to 6 of E-selectin exoplasmic portion fused with the hinge, CH2, and CH3 domains of human IgGl) was constructed as described (15Walz G. Aruffo A. Kolanus W. Bevilacqua M. Seed B. Science. 1990; 250: 1132-1135Crossref PubMed Scopus (886) Google Scholar).2 The establishment of a stable CHO cell line secreting E-selectin Rg, the serum-free tissue culture of this CHO cell line, and the purification of E-selectin Rg werr exactly carried out as described. 2L. Ma, K.-C. Chou, P. S. Kaytes, B. A. Leone, C. F. Toombs, D. J. Staples, M. S. Babcock, H. D. Fischer, C. W. Smith, and J.-G. Geng, submitted loi- publication. The biotinvlated BBA1 mAb to E-selectin was used (instead of biotinvlated P7 mAb to P-selectin) for sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay to screen the high secreting clones. The purified E-selectin Rg was dialvzed against PBS, and samples were subject to SDS-PAGE followed by Coomassie Blur staining, as shown in Fig. 1. E-selectin thus prepared mediated a Ca2 ‘-dependent adhesion of HL-60 cells and human neutrophils (see below). The sample of E-selectin Rg was analyzed by NH.,-terminaI amino acid sequencing with following sequence: WSY.YT-STEAM TYDEASAYXQ QRYTHXVAIQ NK (X: ambiguous residue), fully consistent with the protein sequence of human E-selectin < 16). The EJJi for E-selectin Rg is 15.1 calculated according to the results of acid hydrolysis and compositional analysis of amino acids. Monoclonal IgG antibodies against P-selectin including an adhesion-blocking mAb, P7. an adhesion nonblocking mAb, P23, and a monoclonal IgM antibody against a P-selectin glycoprotein ligand. PL5, were prepared and characterized as described 110), Rabbit antiserum to PSGL-1 was prepared by hyperimmunization of the rabbit with purified recombinant PSGL-1 receptor-globulin. This antiserum was kindly provided by Dr. Dietmar Vestweber (Hans Spermann laboratory at the Max Planck Institute for Immunology. Germany!. CSLEX monoclonal IgM antibody to SLe” was purified from mouse ascites as described previously 110). The purified E-selectin Rg was used as the antigen in primary and booster immunization with BALB/c mice as described 110). Twelve weeks later, the spleen cells of the two mice were fused with myeloma cells. The hybridomas were screened for recognition of E-selectin Rg using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (17Geng J.-G. Moore K.L. Johnson A.E. McEver R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 22313-22318Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Geng J.-G. Heavner G.A. McEver R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 19846-19853Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As the immunogen. E-selectin Rg, contained a Kc fragment (without the CH1 domain) of human IgGl, the hybridoma supernatants were preincubated with human IgG at 37 °C for 1 h (0.1 mg/ml final concentration of human IgG) before transferring them into the microtiter wells immobilized with E-selectin Rg to avoid generation of antibodies against the heavy chain of human IgGl. After subcloning twice, we obtained a panel of four hybridomas (El, E2, E3, E4; designated as E for E-selectin). The ascites from individual hybridomas were prepared for purification of antibodies using Protein A chromatography (10Ma L. Raycroft L. Asa D. Anderson D.C. Geng J.-G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27739-27746Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Each of these antibodies recognized E-selectin Rg but did not recognize P-selectin Rg or human IgG in an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (data not shown). They also bound to CHO cells expressing full-length E-selectin but did not bind to CHO cells expressing full-length P-selectin or throm-bin-activated platelets using a flow cytometric assay (data not shown). Furthermore, these antibodies did not recognize Jurkat T-lymphocytes whereas Leu-8 mAb to L-selectin did recognize these cells (data not shown). HL-60 cells were metabolically labeled with [3H]glucosamine (50 μCi/ml) in RPMI medium containing 10% fetal calf serum for 48 to 72 h as described previously (10Ma L. Raycroft L. Asa D. Anderson D.C. Geng J.-G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27739-27746Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The P-selectin affinity column was prepared by coupling 10 mg of platelet P-selectin directly onto 10 ml of Affi-Gel 15 Sepharose (10Ma L. Raycroft L. Asa D. Anderson D.C. Geng J.-G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27739-27746Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The E-selectin Rg affinity column was prepared by cross-linking 5 mg of E-selectin Rg onto 2 ml of Protein A resin by dimethyl pimelimidate according to the recommendations of the ImmunoPure IgG Orientation Kit (Pierce). A BSA-Sepharose column (10-ml resin) was used as a guard column for P-selectin and E-selectin Rg affinity columns. For specificity control, the human IgG columns were prepared by cross-linking 10 mg of human IgG onto 2 ml of Protein A resin for each column prepared exactly as the E-selectin Rg column described above. The glycoprotein ligands were purified using an EDTA elution of P-selectin affinity column or E-selectin Rg affinity column as published previously (10Ma L. Raycroft L. Asa D. Anderson D.C. Geng J.-G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27739-27746Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The eluted fractions were pooled together and separately placed into dialysis tubing which had been treated with 0.1% BSA (w/v) to lower nonspecific binding. Samples were dialyzed against H20 at 4 °C overnight. After dialysis, they were frozen in a dry ice/acetone bath and lyophilized in glass tubes to dryness. The lyophilized samples were redissolved in a small volume of PBS, and the radioactivities were counted using a Packard liquid scintillation counter (low level detection). This one-step affinity purification could yield P- and E-selectin ligands radiochemically pure as assessed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. To demonstrate cross-depletion of the glycoprotein ligands for P- and E-selectins, the [3H]glucosamine-labeled cell lysates from 2 × 107 cells (labeled with 20 mCi of isotope) were prepared as described above. Two equal aliquote of the cell lysates were applied to the BSA guard column first and then separately applied to P- and E-selectin columns. After washing, the bound materials were eluted from the P-selectin or E-selectin Rg affinity column as described above. The breakthrough from the P-selectin affinity column was reapplied to the E-selectin Rg affinity column, while the breakthrough from the E-selectin Rg affinity column was reapplied to the P-selectin affinity column. After washing, the bound materials were eluted with EDTA as above. Aliquots of each eluted fraction were counted, and radioactivities of these fractions were plotted. The radioactive fractions were pooled, dialyzed, and analyzed by 7% SDS-PAGE and autoradiography as above. The cross-binding properties of the ∼120-kDa molecule on P- and E-selectin affinity columns were demonstrated as follows. The radioactive ligands were purified separately from [3H]glucosamine-labeled HL-60 cells to apparent homogeneity by P- or E-selectin affinity chromatography as above (data not shown I. The purified ligands were dialyzed individually into the buffer containing 1 m.M CaCI., The K-selcctin column-purified ligand (10,000 Cpm) wet reapplied to the P-selectin column, while the P-selectin column-purified ligand (10,000 cpm) was reapplied to the E-selectin column. After washing, the bound ligands were eluted with EDTA from these columns and the radioactivities were counted and plotted. For specificity control, the purified P- and E-selectin ligands (10,000 cpm for each ligand molecule) were separately loaded onto human IgG columns. Following washing, the radioactivities of the EDTA elution fractions were counted. The radiochemically pure glycoprotein ligands isolated by the P- or E-selectin column were precipitated separately with methanol/chloroform (19Wessel D. Flügge U.I. Anal. Biochem. 1984; 138: 141-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (3141) Google Scholar) to remove salts and detergent. Following evaporation to dryness, the O-linked oligosaccharides were released by mild alkaline sodium borohydride treatment (20Carlson D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1968; 243: 616-626Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The released oligosaccharides were dissolved in H2O and washed through SepPak C18 cartridges to remove polypeptide fragments. The released O-linked oligosaccharides were digested with A. ureafaciens sialydase (2 units/ml) in 100 mM acetate buffer, pH 5.0, for 18 h. The desialylated O-linked oligosaccharide “fingerprints” from the molecules isolated on the P- and E-selectin columns were obtained by separating the desialylated oligosaccharides on size exclusion chromatography (GlycoMap Chromatograph, Oxford GlycoSystems). A Bio-Gel P-4 type column (Glycan Sizing Column. Oxford GlycoSystems) and the high resolution program (30 μl/min for 366 min followed by a linear increase to 200 μl/min over 234 mini were used. Two drop fractions (approximately 90 μl) were collected and counted. To obtain biochemical pure P-selectin ligand from unlabeled HL-60 cells, the preparation of membrane lysates from 50 liters of HL-60 cells and the PL5 antibody affinity chromatography were carried out as described previously (10Ma L. Raycroft L. Asa D. Anderson D.C. Geng J.-G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27739-27746Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These materials were dialyzed against PBS, 1 mM CaCl2, 1 mM MgCl2, 0.01% Brij-35 (v/v) and 0.02% N., Na (w/v) (Buffer A) at 4 °C overnight. After a brief centrifugation (14,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C), the clean supernatant was loaded onto the P-selectin affinity column as described (10Ma L. Raycroft L. Asa D. Anderson D.C. Geng J.-G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27739-27746Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). After washing the P-selectin affinity column with 50 ml of Buffer A, the bound proteins were eluted with PBS, 10 mM EDTA, 0.01% Brij-35 (v/v), and 0.02% NaN:i (w/v) (Buffer B). For the purpose of purification and characterization, the nonradioactive P-selectin ligand was dialyzed against H.¿0 and lyophilized as above. The lyophilized material was then resuspended in 200 μl of PBS, 0.01% Brij-35 (v/v), and 0.02% N.Na (w/v) (Buffer C). Following another brief centrifugation, a 50-μ1 aliquot was injected into a 100-μl sample loop for each run on Superdex 200 size exclusion chromatography, using Buffer C at 40 μl/min at 22 °C and collection as 50-μ1 fractions (Smart System, Pharmacia). The protein peaks were monitored at A280 nm and A260 nm. The radiochemical pure P-selectin ligand was chromatographed exactly as above. A 5-μ1 aliquot of each P-selectin ligand fraction was counted for radioactivity. The counting numbers were then multiplied by 10 and plotted. Aliquots of the protein peak from Superdex 200 chromatography (1 μg/lane) were electrophoresed and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Immobilon-P, Millipore). The membranes were separately probed with E-selectin Rg and PL5 IgM mAb (both at 1 μg/ml) as well as PSGL-1 antiserum (1:100 dilution of serum). The membranes were also probed with human IgG (10 μg/mll and nonimmunized serum (1:10 dilution of serum) for experimental control. For detection, the membranes were individually incubated with biotinylated P23 mAb, goat anti-mouse IgM antibody, and goat anti-rabbit and anti-human IgG antibodies (all at 5 μβ/ml) followed by a streptavidin-peroxidase complex (Vectostain ABC Kit, Vector Laboratories) and a chemiluminescent detection system (Amersham) as described previously (10Ma L. Raycroft L. Asa D. Anderson D.C. Geng J.-G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27739-27746Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). E- and P-selectin Rgs and human IgG were diluted in HBSS (5 μg/ml) and immobilized onto the 96-well microtiter plates (50 μl/well) at 4 °C overnight. The cell adhesion assay was performed exactly as described previously (21Geng J.-G. Bevilacqua M.P. Moore K.L. McIntyre T.M. Prescott S.M. Kim J.M. Bliss G.A. Zimmerman G.A. McEver R.P. Nature. 1990; 343: 757-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (802) Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were measured using Micro BCA Assay with BSA as standard (Pierce). An ∼120-kDa glycoprotein (under reducing conditions) can be isolated from [‘Hlglucosamine-labeled HL-60 cells by affinity chromatography using platelet P-selectin or the PL5 mAb (6Moore K.L.

In this study, we have constructed, expressed, and purified E-selectin Rg to be used as a functional equivalent for E-selectin. Following the same approach of affinity purification as that for P-selectin ligand isolation, we investigated how many and which molecule(s) can be isolated from [3H]glucosamine-labeled HL-60 cells by E-selectin Rg affinity chromatography. As shown in Fig. 2, E-selectin Rg affinity chromatography specifically isolated only one glycoprotein (lane 21 from labeled human HL-60 cells. Surprisingly, this molecule had a molecular mass of –120 kDa under reducing conditions; i.e. it has a molecular mass identical with that of the P-selectin glycoprotein ligand isolated by P-selectin affinity chromatography (lane 1). The purified ligands from both P- and E-selectin affinity chromatography routinely account for less than 0.001% of total radioactivity from the cell lysates which have been applied to the affinity columns (data not shown). As an experimental control for specificity, the lysates of labeled HL-60 cells were also applied to human IgG affinity column in the presence of Ca2. After washing, EDTA elution of this column yielded an insignificant amount of radioactivity which could not be precipitated by methanol/chloroform (19Wessel D. Flügge U.I. Anal. Biochem. 1984; 138: 141-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (3141) Google Scholar), suggesting that it probably represented free [3H]glucosamine instead of glycoproteins (data not shown). As P- and E-selectins both bind to the ∼120-kDa molecules, we investigated whether these ligands might actually be the same molecule. To answer this question, cross-depletion experiments were carried out. Two equal amounts of lysates from [3H]glucosamine-labeled HL-60 cells were applied separately to the P- or E-selectin affinity column in the presence of Ca2+. After washing, the bound ligands were eluted with EDTA from the P- (Fig. 3A) and E-selectin columns (Fig. 3C). An aliquot of each fraction from EDTA elution was counted and plotted for radioactivity. As the bound radioactivities accounted for less than 0.001% of total sample radioactivities, only the EDTA-eluted radioactivities were presented. The radioactivities from the sample loading and column washing were omitted. The collected breakthrough from the E-selectin Rg chromatography was pooled together and reapplied to the P-selectin affinity column while the collected breakthrough from the P-selectin chromatography was pooled together and reapplied to the E-selectin affinity column. After extensive washing, the bound ligands were again eluted with EDTA from the P-selectin column (Fig. 3B) and E-selectin column (Fig. 3D). The radioactivities were counted and the EDTA-eluted fractions were plotted. Together, these experiments demonstrated that passing the cell lysates through the P-selectin affinity column depleted the majority of their binding to the following E-selectin affinity column (Fig. 3, A and D) and vice versa (Fig. 3, C and B). However, it was noticed that passing the cell lysates through either the P- or E-selectin affinity column could not completely deplete their binding to the following E-selectin column (Fig. 3D) or P-selectin column (Fig. 3S). As the similar amounts of ligand bind"
https://openalex.org/W2113049699,"Changes in ligand binding ability of the integrin αIIbβ3 can be monitored by the concomitant expression of ligand-inducible binding sites (LIBS). A new LIBS, the hexapeptide sequence GPNICT (residues 1-6) at the amino terminus of β3 recognized by the murine monoclonal antibody (mAb) AP5, is sensitive both to the binding of ligand and to micromolar differences in divalent cation levels. Calcium or magnesium can completely inhibit the binding of AP5 to αIIbβ3 on platelets, with ID50 values of 80 and 1500 μM, respectively. The inhibitory effect of calcium plus magnesium is cumulative. In the presence of 1 mM calcium plus 1 mM magnesium, the peptide RGDW overcomes this inhibition and induces maximal binding of AP5. Maximal AP5 binding is also induced by a molar excess of EDTA. The unique location of the AP5 LIBS was determined by comparing the binding of LIBS-specific mAb to recombinant human-Xenopus β3 chimeras produced in a baculovirus expression system. AP5 defines one region at the amino terminus β31-6. A second region, defined by mAb D3GP3, is probably located within β3422-490, confirming the finding of Kouns et al. (Kouns, W. C., Newman, P. J., Puckett, K. J., Miller, A. A., Wall, C. D., Fox, C. F., Seyer, J. M., and Jennings, L. K.(1991) Blood 78, 3215-3223). The third region, encompassing at most residues 490-690, and perhaps more precisely located within 602-690 (Du X., Gu, M., Weise, J. W., Nagaswami, C., Bennett, J. S., Bowditch, R., and Ginsberg, M. H.(1993) J. Biol. Chem. 268, 23087-23092), is recognized by the four mAb, anti-LIBS2, anti-LIBS3, ant-LIBS6, and P41. Since its exposure is uniquely regulated by both divalent cations and ligand, the amino terminus of β3 may be involved in control of ligand binding by divalent cation mobilization. Changes in ligand binding ability of the integrin αIIbβ3 can be monitored by the concomitant expression of ligand-inducible binding sites (LIBS). A new LIBS, the hexapeptide sequence GPNICT (residues 1-6) at the amino terminus of β3 recognized by the murine monoclonal antibody (mAb) AP5, is sensitive both to the binding of ligand and to micromolar differences in divalent cation levels. Calcium or magnesium can completely inhibit the binding of AP5 to αIIbβ3 on platelets, with ID50 values of 80 and 1500 μM, respectively. The inhibitory effect of calcium plus magnesium is cumulative. In the presence of 1 mM calcium plus 1 mM magnesium, the peptide RGDW overcomes this inhibition and induces maximal binding of AP5. Maximal AP5 binding is also induced by a molar excess of EDTA. The unique location of the AP5 LIBS was determined by comparing the binding of LIBS-specific mAb to recombinant human-Xenopus β3 chimeras produced in a baculovirus expression system. AP5 defines one region at the amino terminus β31-6. A second region, defined by mAb D3GP3, is probably located within β3422-490, confirming the finding of Kouns et al. (Kouns, W. C., Newman, P.

https://openalex.org/W2063758560,"A central enigma of transcriptional regulation is how the normally efficient transcription elongation complex stops at pause and termination signals. One possibility, raised by the discovery that RNA polymerase sometimes contracts its DNA footprint, is that discontinuous movements contribute to recognizing these signals. We report that E. coli RNA polymerase responds to sequences immediately downstream and upstream from the his leader pause site by changing neither its downstream DNA contact nor its upstream RNA contact for 8 bp preceding the pause. This compressed complex isomerizes to a paused conformation by an approximately 10 bp jump of its downstream DNA contact and simultaneous extrusion of an RNA hairpin that stabilizes the paused conformation. We suggest pausing and termination could be alternative outcomes of a similar isomerization that depend on the strength of contacts to 3'-proximal RNA remaining after the jump."
https://openalex.org/W1974555059,"Stimulation of the mast cell line, RBL-2H3, with antigen via the tetrameric (αβγ<sub>2</sub>) immunoglobulin E receptor (FcεR1) leads to the activation of cytosolic phospholipase A<sub>2</sub> and the release of arachidonic acid. This pathway is dependent on the activation of the mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase. In this paper, we show that the MAP kinase/cytosolic phospholipase A<sub>2</sub> pathway is linked to FcεR1 via the cytosolic tyrosine kinase, Syk, and that the GDP/GTP exchange factor, Vav, might be one candidate for accomplishing this link. Cross-linking of transmembrane chimeras containing the FcεR1γ motif, which is known to activate Syk, results in the tyrosine phosphorylation of Vav, activation of MAP kinase, and release of arachidonic acid. Cross-linking of chimeras containing the FcεR1β motif does not cause these events. Furthermore, stimulation of these events by antigen is enhanced by transient overexpression of a wild-type form of Syk and blocked by overexpression of a dominant negative form of Syk. By contrast, stimulation via the transfected, G protein-coupled, muscarinic m1 receptor is not influenced by either form of Syk and does not result in tyrosine phosphorylation of Vav. These data establish unequivocally that the two types of receptor are independently linked to the MAP kinase/cytosolic phospholipase A<sub>2</sub> pathway and demonstrate the existence of the FcεR1-Syk-MAP kinase pathway."

To identify the site(s) of inhibition in the LPS recognition pathway, we analyzed the apparent binding affinities and interactions of 3H-labeled enzymatically deacylated LPS (dLPS) and [3H]LPS with CD14, the LPS receptor, on THP-1 cells. Using (i) incubation conditions that prevented ligand internalization and (ii) defined concentrations of LPS binding protein (LBP), which facilitates LPS and dLPS binding to CD14, we found that dLPS can antagonize LPS in at least three ways. 1) When the concentration of LBP in the medium was suboptimal for promoting LPS-CD14 binding, low concentrations of dLPS were able to compete with LPS for binding CD14, suggesting competition between LPS and dLPS for engaging LBP. 2) When LBP was present in excess, dLPS could compete with LPS for binding CD14, but only at dLPS concentrations that were at or above its KDfor binding CD14 (100 ng/ml). 3) In contrast, substoichiometric concentrations of dLPS (1 ng/ml) inhibited LPS-induced (3 ng/ml) interleukin-8 release without blocking LPS binding to CD14. Functional antagonism was possible without competition for cell-surface binding because both LPS-induced interleukin-8 release and dLPS inhibition occurred at concentrations that were far below their respective CD14 binding KDvalues.

Responses to LPS in human cells show stringent requirements for certain structural features of lipid A, the bioactive center of LPS, including a diglucosamine backbone that bears both 1 and 4′ phosphates and acyloxyacyl-linked (secondary) fatty acids (1Takada H. Kotani S. Morrison D.C. Ryan J.L. Bacterial Endotoxic Lipopolysaccharides. Vol. I. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1992: 107-135Google Scholar). For example, a synthetic tetraacyl lipid A partial structure that lacks secondary fatty acids (compound 406 or LA-14-PP) is virtually inactive in in vitro assays using human cells (1Takada H. Kotani S. Morrison D.C. Ryan J.L. Bacterial Endotoxic Lipopolysaccharides. Vol. I. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1992: 107-135Google Scholar). LPS molecules bearing tetraacyl lipid A structures may be generated by a leukocyte enzyme, acyloxyacyl hydrolase (2Munford R.S. Hall C.L. Science. 1986; 234: 203-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar), which removes secondary fatty acyl chains from a variety of bacterial LPSs (3Erwin A.L. Munford R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 16444-16449Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Enzymatically deacylated LPS (dLPS) has greatly reduced stimulatory activity in human cells. Moreover, Pohlman et al. (4Pohlman T.H. Munford R.S. Harlan J.M. J. Exp. Med. 1987; 165: 1393-1402Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) showed that dLPS inhibits the ability of LPS, but not other agonists, to stimulate adhesion of neutrophils to human endothelial cells. Subsequently, others showed that dLPS (5Riedo F.X. Munford R.S. Campbell W.B. Reisch J.S. Chien K.R. Gerard R.D. J. Immunol. 1990; 144: 3506-3512PubMed Google Scholar, 6Dal Nogare A.R.

As initially suggested by Pohlman et al. (4Pohlman T.H. Munford R.S. Harlan J.M. J. Exp. Med. 1987; 165: 1393-1402Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), the analogs may compete with LPS for binding certain critical molecules in the LPS recognition pathway. A likely target would be CD14, an important LPS receptor that, in the presence of LPS binding protein (LBP), mediates cellular responses to low concentrations of LPS (13Schumann R.R. Leong S.R. Flaggs G.W. Gray P.W. Wright S.D. Mathison J.C. Tobias P.S. Ulevitch R.J. Science. 1990; 249: 1429-1431Crossref PubMed Scopus (1367) Google Scholar, 14Wright S.D. Ramos R.A. Tobias P.S. Ulevitch R.J.

Immunobiology. 1993; 187: 303-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) have found that high concentrations of synthetic tetraacyl lipid A analogs (e.g. LA-14-PP and PE-4) can inhibit LPS binding to monocytes, presumably by competing with LPS for binding CD14. In contrast, we found that dLPS and LA-14-PP can inhibit responses to LPS without inhibiting CD14-mediated LPS uptake by cells of the human THP-1 monocytic cell line (8Kitchens R.L. Ulevitch R.J. Munford R.S. J. Exp. Med. 1992; 176: 485-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). To attempt to resolve this issue, we performed quantitative analyses of the binding of [3H]LPS and [3H]dLPS to THP-1 cells under conditions that prevent ligand internalization. Our results indicate that, depending upon the experimental conditions, dLPS can prevent the LPS-CD14 interaction by competing with LPS for binding either LBP or CD14. In addition, dLPS can also antagonize the stimulatory activity of LPS without inhibiting the binding of LPS to CD14. Remarkably, although dLPS binds to CD14 with substantially lower affinity than does LPS, 50% inhibition of the response to LPS can occur with dLPS:LPS ratios of 0.2 or less. Our results indicate that LPS antagonism by lipid A analogs may occur at three distinct sites in the LPS recognition pathway, and they point to the existence of an undiscovered inhibitory mechanism that occurs after the interaction of LPS with CD14.MATERIALS AND METHODSCellsCells of the THP-1 human monocyte cell line (21Tsuchiya S. Yamabe M. Yamaguchi Y. Kobayashi Y. Konno T. Tada K. Int. J. Cancer. 1980; 26: 171-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (1652) Google Scholar) were obtained from D. Altieri (Scripps Research Institute, La Jolla, CA) and cultured as described previously (8Kitchens R.L. Ulevitch R.J. Munford R.S. J. Exp. Med. 1992; 176: 485-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). To induce elevated expression of CD14, the cells were exposed to 0.05 μM 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3for 48 h.ReagentsPurified LBP from acute phase rabbit serum was generously provided by Dr. Peter S. Tobias (Scripps Research Institute, La Jolla, CA), and each lot was tested to determine the ratio of LBP to LPS that produced maximal binding to CD14. Unless otherwise stated, a molar and functional excess of LBP was used in the binding assays. On a weight basis, LBP was typically present at 15-80-fold higher concentrations than LPS. Proteinase K, phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C (PI-PLC from Bacillus cereus), Nonidet P-40, sodium deoxycholate, SDS, iodoacetamide, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, aprotinin, leupeptin, TPCK, and ZPCK were obtained from Sigma. Octylglucoside (octyl-β-D-glucopyranoside) was from Calbiochem (San Diego, CA). Anti-CD14 mAbs 60bca and 26ic in mouse ascites fluid were provided by Dr. Robert F. Todd (University of Michigan, Ann Arbor).LPS Preparations[3H]LPS was biosynthetically labeled using Escherichia coli LCD25 (22Munford R.S. DeVeaux L.C. Cronan Jr., J.E. Rick P.D. J. Immunol. Methods. 1992; 148: 115-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) to a specific activity of 6 × 106dpm/μg of LPS. A molecular weight of 4,000 was estimated for the LPS monomer (8Kitchens R.L. Ulevitch R.J. Munford R.S. J. Exp. Med. 1992; 176: 485-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). Unlabeled LPS was derived from the same strain, LCD25. dLPS was produced from these preparations using acyloxyacyl hydrolase as described previously (5Riedo F.X. Munford R.S. Campbell W.B. Reisch J.S. Chien K.R. Gerard R.D. J. Immunol. 1990; 144: 3506-3512PubMed Google Scholar). The specific activity of [3H]dLPS was 4.2 × 106dpm/μg. LPS from Salmonella minnesota R5 was repurified using deoxycholate (23Manthey C.L. Vogel S.N. J Endotoxin Res. 1994; 1: 84-91Crossref Scopus (96) Google Scholar), derivatized with SASD and radioiodinated using Iodogen (Pierce) as described elsewhere (24Wollenweber H.-W. Morrison D.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 15068-15074Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This preparation did not contain protein impurities (<0.1% by weight) by silver staining or by fluorography of SDS-PAGE gels.Preparation of Fab Fragments of mAb 60bca60bca was purified on γ-bind G (Pierce) before preparation of antibody fragments. Fab fragments were purified from papain digests using protein A-Sepharose (unbound fraction) followed by gel filtration chromatography on Sephacryl S-100-HR (Sigma). Preparations were pure as assessed by Coomassie Blue-stained SDS-PAGE gels.Measurement of CD14 ExpressionCD14 expression was measured by analyzing the binding of mAb 60bca (Fab) as described previously (25Tobias P.S. Soldau K. Kline L. Lee J.-D. Kato K. Martin T.P. Ulevitch R.J. J. Immunol. 1993; 150: 3011-3021PubMed Google Scholar, 26Kirkland T.N. Finley F. Leturcq D. Moriarty A. Lee J.-D. Ulevitch R.J. Tobias P.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24818-24823Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were incubated with increasing concentrations of radioiodinated antibody fragments for 1 h on ice. Cell-bound and free antibody fragments were separated by centrifugation over a 10% sucrose cushion. Nonspecific binding was determined in the presence of unlabeled 60bca (whole IgG) at a 150-fold excess over the highest concentration of labeled antibody used. The data were analyzed by hyperbolic curve fitting or Scatchard analysis (below). The number of molecules/cell was derived from specific radioactivities determined by measuring labeled Fab concentrations spectrophotometrically and assuming a molecular weight of 50,000.LPS Binding AssayEquilibrium binding of [3H]LPS to the cells was performed by the method of Kirkland et al. (26Kirkland T.N. Finley F. Leturcq D. Moriarty A. Lee J.-D. Ulevitch R.J. Tobias P.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24818-24823Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with minor modifications. THP-1 cells were washed in ice-cold HNE buffer (20 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA), preincubated for 30 min at 37°C in SEBDAF buffer (20 mM HEPES (pH = 7.4), 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 300 μg/ml BSA, 10 mM NaN3, 2 mM NaF, 5 mM deoxyglucose) to prevent ligand internalization. The cells were then centrifuged, resuspended in either SEBDAF buffer or RPMI-B (RPMI 1640 containing 300 μg/ml BSA, 10 mM NaN3, 2 mM NaF, and 10 mM deoxyglucose), and counted using a hemocytometer. Cells used for determination of nonspecific binding were preincubated for at least 15 min on ice with mAb 60bca (usually 0.7 μl of ascites fluid in 50-100 μl of binding buffer) before adding LPS. The LPS was sonicated (8Kitchens R.L. Ulevitch R.J. Munford R.S. J. Exp. Med. 1992; 176: 485-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar) either in SEBDAF buffer or RPMI-B, and purified LBP was added to the LPS at room temperature 10 min before mixing with the cells. In some experiments the LPS and LBP were added to the cells at the same time, with similar results. The LPS (in 10-20 μl) was added to the cells (4 × 105VD3-induced cells in 50 μl, final volume) and allowed to bind with frequent mixing for 30 min at 37 or 10°C. 450 μl of ice-cold binding buffer (without inhibitors) were then added, and the mixtures were centrifuged at 6,000 rpm (2,800 × g) for 15 s. The 3H contained in 200 μl of supernatant was counted to determine the amount of unbound LPS, the remaining supernatant was aspirated, and the cells were washed with 500 μl of binding buffer (without inhibitors). The cells were resuspended in 100 μl of buffer, and the cell-associated 3H was counted after adding 0.2 ml of 1% SDS, 10 mM EDTA and 3 ml of scintillation fluid. The time required to wash the cells resulted in minimal dissociation since the t for ligand dissociation was greater than 1 h (not shown). The previously described (26Kirkland T.N. Finley F. Leturcq D. Moriarty A. Lee J.-D. Ulevitch R.J. Tobias P.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24818-24823Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) wash step (30 min in 50 μl of binding buffer) was omitted in most experiments since this step had little or no effect on the results of the assay. Fewer than 10% of the cells were permeable to trypan blue following incubation in SEBDAF or RPMI-B.Data AnalysisKDand Bmax values were determined by curve fitting to the hyperbolic function (Bmax× [free LPS]/(KD+ [free LPS]) using GraphPad InPlot Software (Graph Pad Software Inc., San Diego, CA) or by Scatchard analysis. The KD, or equilibrium dissociation constant, is defined as the concentration of free ligand required to saturate half of the available CD14 binding sites. Bmax refers to the maximum number of ligand binding sites under saturating conditions.Stripping Cell Surface-bound LigandsLabeled LPS or dLPS were bound to the cells and washed as described above. The surface-bound ligands were then stripped by two methods. (i) The cells were incubated on ice for 45 min in 500 μl of 0.02% proteinase K in phosphate-buffered saline (27Hara-Kuge S. Amano F. Nishijima M. Akamatsu Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 6606-6610Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), 500 μl of buffer containing 20% fetal calf serum were added, the cells were recovered by centrifugation, and the radioactivity in an aliquot of supernatant was counted. (ii) Stripping with PI-PLC was performed as previously described (26Kirkland T.N. Finley F. Leturcq D. Moriarty A. Lee J.-D. Ulevitch R.J. Tobias P.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24818-24823Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using 0.5 unit of PI-PLC with the washed cells in a 50-μl final volume for 30 min at 10°C. The proportions of tritiated ligands in the cells and culture supernatants were determined by scintillation counting. In some experiments, acid stripping of the ligands was attempted by resuspending the washed cells in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline adjusted to pH 3 with acetic acid for 5 min, followed by centrifugation to recover the cells and supernatants.Cross-linking LPS to CD14VD3-induced THP-1 cells (5 × 107cells in 10 ml of RPMI 1640 + 1% fetal calf serum) were incubated in the dark for 10 min at 37°C with 20 ng/ml 125I-ASD-LPS in the presence or absence of the same concentrations of unlabeled dLPS added 1 min before the LPS. The cell suspension was transferred to a 10-cm dish on ice, and the cross-linker was activated for 2 min with a hand-held 254-nm UV light (UVP, San Gabriel, CA). The cells were washed in cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed for 30 min on ice in 200 μl of lysis buffer (20 mM Tris(Cl−), pH 7.5, 250 mM NaCl, 2 mM EDTA, 20 mM octylglucoside, 1% (w/v) Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 5 mM iodoacetamide, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 0.1 mM TPCK, and 0.1 mM ZPCK). The lysate was centrifuged for 15 min at 12,000 × g, and 200 μl (4 mg protein) of lysate supernatant were passed over a 50-μl column of protein A-Sepharose containing prebound αCD14 mAb 26ic. The column was washed with 1 ml of lysis buffer followed by 200 μl of lysis buffer diluted 1:10 in 100 mM Tris, pH 6.8, 2 mM EDTA, and 10% glycerol. The CD14 was recovered by adding 50 μl of 2 × SDS sample buffer to the protein A-Sepharose, heating in boiling water for 5 min, and removing the beads by centrifugation. The samples were run on a 16-cm, 10% polyacrylamide SDS-PAGE gel, and the CD14 bands were detected by autoradiography.Cell Stimulation and Interleukin-8 (IL-8) AssaysVD3-induced THP-1 cells were washed in cold HNE buffer and resuspended in RPMI 1640 + 300 μg/ml BSA at 0.8 × 106cells/100 μl, final volume, in microcentrifuge tubes. For comparison with cross-linking assays, the cells were resuspended in RPMI 1640 + 1% fetal calf serum at 5 × 106cells/ml in six-well culture plates. LPS or dLPS were prepared in RPMI + 300 μg/ml BSA by sonication (see above), and LBP or 1% fetal calf serum was added at room temperature 10 min before adding to the cells. The cells were incubated for the specific times at 37°C, pelleted by brief centrifugation, and IL-8 was measured in the culture supernatants by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (R & D Systems, Minneapolis, MN).RESULTSTHP-1 Cells Express CD14THP-1 cells cultured in the presence of VD3 express elevated levels of cell-surface CD14 (8Kitchens R.L.

Quantitative analysis of CD14 expression was performed by binding 125I-labeled Fab fragments of an αCD14 mAb to cells that had been exposed to VD3 for 48 h. This analysis revealed an average of 5.2 (± 2.3 S.D., n = 5) × 105binding sites/cell (KD= 10-9M), in good agreement with previous estimates (3 × 105and 6 × 105sites/cell) (25Tobias P.S. Soldau K.

Uninduced cells expressed low levels of CD14 that were undetectable by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (1.3 (± 0.6 S.D.) × 104binding sites/cell, n = 7)), also in agreement with a previous report (25Tobias P.S.

Preincubation for 30 min at 37°C in SEBDAF buffer did not result in significant cell loss or permeability to trypan blue. Subsequent binding incubations were done in SEBDAF buffer or in RPMI 1640 that contained the same inhibitors (RPMI-B). Ligand binding to SEBDAF-pretreated cells was performed at 10 or 37°C. Two methods were used to strip the surface-bound ligands from the cells. (i) PI-PLC cleaves CD14 from its lipid anchor (26Kirkland T.N. Finley F. Leturcq D. Moriarty A. Lee J.-D. Ulevitch R.J. Tobias P.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24818-24823Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and (ii) proteinase K digests unprotected proteins on the extracellular surface of the plasma membrane (27Hara-Kuge S. Amano F. Nishijima M. Akamatsu Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 6606-6610Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As shown in Table I, the percentages of cell-bound ligands released by either method were only modestly decreased following binding at 37°C compared to binding at 10°C. This indicates that internalization was minimal at 37°C. Treatment of the cells with PI-PLC removed most of the bound LPS and dLPS, providing evidence that the ligands remained bound to CD14. When the metabolic inhibitors were not added, most of the bound LPS or dLPS became internalized (i.e. could not be stripped) (Table I). In separate experiments (not shown), proteinase K treatment did not significantly reduce the cell number or increase cellular permeability to trypan blue. However, this treatment destroyed many of the cells that were already trypan blue-permeable (10% or less) before proteinase K treatment. In experiments not shown, LPS and dLPS were not removed by a conventional stripping protocol for protein ligands (acetate-buffered saline at pH 3) even though this treatment dramatically increased cell permeability to trypan blue. The rate of spontaneous dissociation during the stripping procedures was consistent with the slow, monophasic dissociation rates for LPS and dLPS (t1/2greater than 1 h) (data not shown), suggesting that these ligands dissociate from CD14. Taken together, the data in Table I indicate that, under the conditions of the binding assay, LPS and dLPS bind to CD14 with minimal internalization and that most of each ligand remains associated with CD14 after 30 min at 37 or 10°C.Table I:Release of LPS or dLPS bound to THP-1 cells Open table in a new tab Specific Binding of LPS and dLPS to THP-1 Cells Is CD14-dependentAn incubation temperature of 37°C was used for most experiments since internalization was not significantly increased at this temperature compared to 10°C. As shown in Fig. 1, most of the cellular binding of [3H]LPS or [3H]dLPS was inhibited by a large excess of unlabeled LPS or dLPS. The absence of LBP or the presence of anti-CD14 mAb 60bca also inhibited specific binding, indicating that LBP and CD14 mediate essentially all measurable specific binding in these cells. As shown previously (8Kitchens R.L. Ulevitch R.J. Munford R.S. J. Exp. Med. 1992; 176: 485-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar), a small but measurable amount of LPS binding to CD14 occurred in the absence of LBP. Similar results were obtained when ligands were bound to the cells in the presence of SEBDAF buffer (not shown). Analysis of [3H]LPS and [3H]dLPS Binding to CD14-The specific binding of LPS and dLPS to CD14 was saturable when studied in SEBDAF buffer (Fig. 2, A and B). In the presence of excess LBP, the apparent equilibrium dissociation constant (KD) for LPS was 33 ng/ml (± 1, n = 2) or 8.3 nM. This value is similar to those reported by Kirkland et al., who used human serum as a source of LBP at 10° or 37°C (KD= 27-49 nM). Analysis of dLPS binding (Fig. 2 B) showed a lower binding affinity, as reflected in a higher KD(101 ng/ml (± 14, n = 2) or 28 nM). The results obtained by Scatchard analysis were similar (not shown). dLPS binding in RPMI-B (not shown) yielded results that were similar to those obtained in SEBDAF buffer. In RPMI-B, LPS binding was more erratic, presumably due to increased LPS aggregate structure in the presence of divalent cations, and could not be analyzed with confidence. The analysis of LPS and dLPS binding affinities in uninduced THP-1 cells (not shown) yielded similar results to those obtained in VD3-induced cells.Figure 2:Analysis of LPS and dLPS binding. VD3-induced THP-1 cells were pretreated in SEBDAF buffer, and the binding of increasing concentrations of [3H]LPS (A) or [3H]dLPS (B) was measured in the presence of excess LBP. Assays were performed in triplicate with 4 × 105cells/50 μl of SEBDAF buffer at 37°C. Specific binding is shown by filled circles and error bars which denote the mean ± S.D. of triplicate determinations. Nonspecific binding (dashed lines) was determined in the presence of αCD14 mAb 60bca.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Bmax values (maximal binding at saturation) for LPS and dLPS (Fig. 2, A and B) were somewhat variable but always within the same order of magnitude as Bmax values obtained from the binding of 125I-Fab fragments of CD14 mAb 60bca (above). This suggests that the binding stoichiometry of LPS (or dLPS) to CD14 is near 1:1, in contrast to previously reported values of 8:1 and 20:1 (26Kirkland T.N. Finley F. Leturcq D. Moriarty A. Lee J.-D. Ulevitch R.J. Tobias P.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24818-24823Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).When LBP Is Limiting, Low Concentrations of dLPS Can Inhibit LPS Binding to CD14When the LBP concentration is suboptimal, concentrations of dLPS that are far below its KDcan inhibit binding of LPS to CD14. As shown in Table II, the binding of 2 nM [3H]LPS (8 ng/ml) was submaximal in the presence of 0.1 nM or lower concentrations of LBP. Under these conditions, adding an equal concentration of dLPS inhibited LPS binding to CD14 by approximately 50%, whereas this amount of dLPS had very little inhibitory effect at LBP concentrations (≥1 nM) that produced maximal LPS binding. The inhibition of LPS binding by dLPS presumably occurs by competition for binding to LBP.Table II:Low concentrations of dLPS inhibit LPS binding to CD14 when LBP is limiting Open table in a new tab In the Presence of Excess LBP, High Concentrations of dLPS Can Inhibit LPS Binding to CD14As shown in Fig. 3, 50% inhibition of the binding of [3H]LPS (3 ng/ml) occurred in the presence of a concentration of dLPS (approximately 100 ng/ml) that was equal to the binding KDfor dLPS. This result was expected since the KDof a ligand is defined as the concentration required to occupy half of the available receptor binding sites at equilibrium. Low concentrations of dLPS (below 10 ng/ml) did not significantly inhibit LPS binding, since these concentrations are far below the KDfor dLPS. Our data do not rule out the possibility that dLPS might inhibit the ability of LPS to bind to CD14 by sequestering the LPS in aggregate structures. This explanation seems unlikely, however, since sucrose gradient analyses indicated that both LPS and dLPS were highly disaggregated in the presence of LBP and SEBDAF buffer (not shown), and the inhibitory ability of dLPS was similar whether the binding was performed in the presence (RPMI-B) or absence (SEBDAF) of di"

We previously showed that gp130 stimulation rapidly activates Jak, Btk, and Tec tyrosine kinases, all of which constitutively associate with gp130. To further elucidate intracellular signal transduction through gp130, we examined the possible involvement of another nonreceptor tyrosine kinase, p92c-fes (Fes). We showed that gp130 stimulation rapidly induced tyrosine phosphorylation of Fes and actually activated its kinase activity in hematopoietic lineage cells. Furthermore, Fes associated with gp130 independently of ligand stimulation like Jak, Btk, and Tec tyrosine kinases. These results indicate that multiple nonreceptor tyrosine kinases are involved in the gp130-mediated signal transduction pathway. Because both gp130 and Fes are expressed not only in hematopoietic lineage cells but also in heart and nerve cells, Fes may play a role in signal transduction through gp130 in these tissues. gp130 is a signal-transducing subunit of receptors for the interleukin-6 (IL-6)-related cytokine subfamily including IL-6, leukemia inhibitory factor, oncostatin M, IL-11, and ciliary neurotrophic factor, indicating that gp130-mediated signals are involved in the immune response, hematopoiesis, inflammation, and endocrine and nervous system activity.

Kishimoto T. J. Immunol. 1992; 148: 4066-4071PubMed Google Scholar), we examined whether gp130 stimulation activates Fes tyrosine kinase. In this study, we showed that the stimulation of gp130 in murine hematopoietic cells induced the activation of Fes kinase and that Fes associated with gp130 independently of ligand stimulation. Cell Lines—An IL-3-dependent murine pro B-cell line, BAF-B03, was maintained in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and 10% conditioned medium from WEHI-3B cells as a source of IL-3. A stable transfectant that expresses murine gp130, BAFm130, was established by transfecting BAF-B03 with pBCMGm130 as described previously (11Matsuda T. Yamanaka Y. Hirano T. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Kaisho T. Nakajima K. Hirano T. Blood. 1992; 80: 2298-2305Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), was maintained in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. Antibodies—Monoclonal antibodies against human gp130 (AM64) and murine gp130 (HMβ1 and RMβ3 (HMβ1 and RMβ3,4)) were previously described (2Hibi M. Murakami M. Saito M. Hirano T. Taga T. Kishimoto T.

Rabbit anti-Fes antiserum was generated against a synthetic peptide corresponding to amino acid residues 424–443 of p92c-fes, an upstream region of the SH2 domain, and used for immunoprecipitation (32Hanazono Y.

Immunoprecipitation and Immunoblotting—Y6 cells were starved in serum-free medium for 1–2 h and then incubated for various periods with recombinant IL-6 (200 ng/ml, kindly provided from Ajinomoto Co., Kawasaki, Kanagawa, Japan). Other cells were starved in serum-free medium for 1–2 h and then incubated for various times with recombinant IL-6 (200 ng/ml) and recombinant soluble human IL-6 receptor α (sIL-6Rα) (33Yasukawa K.

The cells were lysed in a lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.15 m NaCl, containing 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm NaF, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 10 μg/ml each of aprotinin, pepstatin, and leupeptin). In some experiments, cells were lysed under a mild detergent condition utilizing a lysis buffer containing 0.1% Nonidet P-40. The immunoprecipitates from the cell lysates were resolved to 4–20% SDS-PAGE and transferred to an Immobilon filter (Millipore, Bedford, MA). The Immobilon filter was then immunoblotted with an anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (4G10, UBI, New YorK, NY). Immunoreactive proteins were visualized using an enhanced chemiluminescence detection system (Amersham, Tokyo, Japan). In-gel Kinase Assay—An in-gel kinase assay was performed as described previously (16Matsuda T. Hirano T. Blood. 1994; 83: 3457-3461Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The immunoprecipitate with anti-Fes antiserum from cell lysates was resolved by 4–20% SDS-PAGE. After electrophoresis, the gel was washed twice with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, and 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, incubated with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, and 6 m guanidine hydrochloride and washed with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4 and 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol containing 0.04% Tween 40 (Nacalai Tesque, Kyoto, Japan). The gel was incubated in 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 20 mm MgCl2, 20 mm MnCl2, 2 mm dithiothreitol and 5 μCi/ml [γ-32P]αTP at 30 °C for 30 min. Finally, the gel was washed several times with 5% trichloroacetic acid and 5% sodium pyrophosphate; this step was followed by drying and autoradiography. Phosphorylated proteins were detected by a Fujix BAS2000 Bio-image analyzer (Fuji Film, Tokyo, Japan). Since the complex of IL-6 and sIL-6Rα can stimulate gp130 (2Hibi M. Murakami M. Saito M. Hirano T. Taga T. Kishimoto T. Cell. 1990; 63: 1149-1157Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1097) Google Scholar, 9Hirano T. Matsuda T. Nakajima K. Stem Cells. 1994; 12: 262-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar), to examine the signal transduction pathway through gp130 we stimulated a BAF-B03 transformant that expresses gp130, BAFm130, with IL-6 and sIL-6Rα. Fig. 1 shows that gp130 stimulation induced tyrosine phosphorylation of Fes in BAFm130. We also showed that IL-6 induced tyrosine phosphorylation of Fes protein in a murine hematopoietic cell line, Y6, which differentiates into macrophages with apoptotic cell death upon IL-6 stimulation (Fig. 1, a, 2). Reprobing with antisera against respective proteins confirmed that the stimulation-induced changes were not due to alteration of protein levels (Fig. 1, lower panels). The time course of tyrosine phosphorylation of Fes by gp130 stimulation was investigated in BAFm130 cells. As shown in Fig. 1b, tyrosine phosphorylation of Fes reached the maximum level 5–15 min after gp130 stimulation and decreased after 30 min. We further examined whether gp130 stimulation actually activates the tyrosine kinase activity of Fes. Cell lysates of BAFm130 were immunoprecipitated with anti-Fes antiserum, and the kinase activity of the immunoprecipitate was examined by an in-gel kinase assay. Fig. 1c shows that the immunoprecipitate from the cells stimulated by gp130 had higher in vitro kinase activity than that of unstimulated cells at the position corresponding to the molecular weight of Fes proteins, indicating that the gp130 stimulation actually activated Fes tyrosine kinase. Next, we tried to determine whether Fes tyrosine kinase associates with gp130. For this purpose, we made another anti-Fes antiserum, anti-Fes/C, to raise the sensitivity of the detection of Fes protein. We immunoprecipitated the cell lysates of BAFm130 under a mild detergent condition as described under “Materials and Methods.” Fig. 2a shows that the immunoprecipitate with an anti-murine gp130 monoclonal antibody from either gp130-stimulated or unstimulated BAFm130 cells contained Fes, indicating that Fes is associated with gp130 independently of ligand stimulation. To further confirm this, we examined whether the immunoprecipitate with anti-Fes contains gp130. Fig. 2b shows that gp130 was present in the immunoprecipitate with anti-Fes antiserum from either stimulated or unstimulated cells. Taken together the results showed that Fes protein was constitutively associated with gp130. c-fes/fps proto-oncogene encodes a 92-kDa nonreceptor type protein tyrosine kinase consisting of a unique N-terminal domain, a central SH2 domain, and a C-terminal catalytic domain. The expression of Fes/Fps has been reported exclusively in hematopoietic cells and most abundantly in those of the myeloid lineages (26Feldman R.A. Gabrilove J.L. Tam J.P. Moore M.A.S. Hanafusa H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 2379-2383Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 27MacDonald I. Levy J. Pawson T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1985; 5: 2543-2551Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). In embryonic and adult hematopoietic cells, Fes is abundantly expressed in both undifferentiated progenitors and differentiated granulomonocytic precursors but not in erythroblasts. It has been shown that IL-4, GM-CSF, and erythropoietin induce the tyrosine phosphorylation and activation of Fes tyrosine kinase (32Hanazono Y. Chiba S. Sasaki K. Mano H. Miyajima A. Arai K. Yazaki Y. Hirai H. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 1641-1646Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 34Hanazono Y. Chiba S. Sasaki K. Mano H. Yazaki Y. Hirai H.

Furthermore, Fes protein physically associates with either IL-4 receptor or the β chain of GM-CSF receptor. In this study, we showed that Fes was also involved in the gp130-mediated signaling pathway. Since the IL-6 family of cytokines is known to act on hematopoietic lineage cells (9Hirano T. Matsuda T. Nakajima K. Stem Cells. 1994; 12: 262-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar, 36Ogawa M. Blood. 1993; 81: 2844-2853Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), all evidence shows that Fes tyrosine kinase is a molecule commonly involved in signal transduction through hematopoietic cytokine receptors. By in situ hybridization analysis of c-fes expression, a spatially and temporally regulated transcription of c-fes has been shown in the central nervous system and in developing cartilage (28Care A. Mattia G. Montesoro E. Parolini I. Russo G. Colombo M.P. Peschle C. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 739-747PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, c-fes expression has been detected in cardiac muscle in early human embryos. More interestingly, transgenic mice carrying the v-fps/fes tyrosine kinase gene showed several independent abnormalities such as cardiomegaly and striking bilateral enlargement of the trigeminal nerves, suggesting that the v-fps/fes transgene is involved in mammalian neural and cardiac development (37Yee S-P. Mock D. Maltby V. Silver M. Rossant J. Bernstein A. Pawson T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 5873-5877Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Considering the wide expression of c-fes and the pleiotropic effects of v-fps transgene, c-fes may play a role in the ontogenic development of nonhematopoietic tissues including the central nervous system and heart. Recently, the cDNA cloning of a novel cytokine that induces cardiac myocyte hypertrophy, cardiotropin-1, was performed (38Pennica D. King K.L. Shaw J.J. Luis E. Rullamas J. Luoh S.-M. Darbonne W.C. Knutzon D.S. Yen R. Chien K.R. Barker J.B. Wood W.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1142-1146Crossref PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar). This novel cytokine is similar to IL-6 and seems to utilize gp130 as its receptor subunit. Since gp130 is shared by the receptors for both ciliary neurotrophic factor and leukemia inhibitory factor, which act on nerve cells (9Hirano T. Matsuda T. Nakajima K. Stem Cells. 1994; 12: 262-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar), and gp130 is expressed not only in hematopoietic lineage cells but also in nerve cells and the heart (29Saito M. Yoshida K. Hibi M. Taga T. Kishimoto T. J. Immunol. 1992; 148: 4066-4071PubMed Google Scholar), it is suggested that Fes tyrosine kinase plays a role in signal transduction through gp130 not only in the hematopoietic system as shown in the present study but also in the nervous system and heart. Although Jak tyrosine kinase is a tyrosine kinase that associates with many cytokine receptors, the pleiotropic functions of cytokine may be generated by the involvement of additional receptor-associated nonreceptor type tyrosine kinases such as Fes, Btk, and Tec or a combination of these tyrosine kinases, which are expressed differently in a variety of tissues."
https://openalex.org/W2075260321,"We earlier reported calcium-dependent, heparin-like L-selectin ligands in cultured bovine endothelial cells (Norgard-Sumnicht, K. E., Varki, N. M., and Varki, A.(1993) Science 261,480-483). Here we show that these are heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) associated either with the cultured cells or secreted into the medium and extracellular matrix. Activation of the endothelial cells with bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) does not markedly alter the amount or distribution of this material. A major portion of the glycosaminoglycan (GAG) chains released from these HSPGs by alkaline β-elimination rebinds to L-selectin in the presence of calcium, indicating that these saccharides alone can mediate the high affinity recognition. Heparin lyase digestions indicate that these GAG chains are enriched in heparan sulfate, not heparin sequences.Current understanding of the biosynthesis of heparan sulfate chains indicates that all glucosamine amino groups must be either N-acetylated or N-sulfated. However, nitrous acid deamination at pH 4.0 suggests the presence of some unsubstituted amino groups in these L-selectin-binding GAG chains from endothelial cell HSPGs. This is confirmed by chemical N-reacetylation and by reactivity with sulfo-N-hydroxysuccinimide-biotin. These unsubstituted amino groups are also found on HSPGs from human umbilical vein endothelial cells, but are not detected in those from Chinese hamster ovary cells. In both bovine and human endothelial cells, these novel groups are enriched for in the HS-GAG chains which bind to L-selectin. Despite this, studies with N-reacetylation and nitrous acid deamination do not show conclusive evidence for the direct involvement of the unsubstituted amino groups in L-selectin binding. This may be because the chemical reactions used to modify the amino groups do not go to completion. Alternatively, the unsubstituted amino groups may only be indirectly involved in generating binding, by dictating the biosynthesis of another critical group. Regardless, these studies shown that HSPGs from cultured endothelial cells which can bind to L-selectin are enriched with unsubstituted amino groups on their GAG chains. The possible biochemical mechanisms for generation of these novel groups are discussed. We earlier reported calcium-dependent, heparin-like L-selectin ligands in cultured bovine endothelial cells (Norgard-Sumnicht, K. E., Varki, N. M., and Varki, A.(1993) Science 261,480-483).

The selectins are a family of glycoproteins responsible for the initial recognition and binding events in both the normal exit or “homing” of leukocytes from the blood stream and in leukocyte emigration into inflamed tissues (1Picker L.J.

Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1994; 6: 663-673Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar). All three members of this family, E-, P-, and L-selectin, contain the following common domains: an amino-terminal calcium-dependent carbohydrate recognition domain, an epidermal growth factor-like domain, variable numbers of complement-regulatory repeat domains, a transmembrane segment, and a cytoplasmic domain (1Picker L.J.

Each selectin has been shown to recognize carbohydrate ligands on the opposing cells during various biologically important recognition processes. Partly because of the therapeutic potential for interrupting abnormal leukocyte emigration into tissues in pathological situations, much work has been done to identify the carbohydrate ligands involved in selectin recognition. Interactions of all three of the selectins can be blocked by high concentrations of the tetrasaccharide sialyl-Lewisx (SL 1The abbreviations used are: SLexsialyl Lewis-xHSPGheparin/heparan sulfate proteoglycanGAGglycosaminoglycanHSheparin/heparan sulfateCPAEcalf pulmonary artery endothelial cellCHOChinese hamster ovary cellHUVEChuman umbilical vein endothelial cellLPSlipopolysaccharidePBSphosphate-buffered salineLS-RgL-selectin receptor globulinMOPS3-[N-Morpholino]propanesulfonic acidPAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresisHONOnitrous acidFPLCfast protein liquid chromatography. ex-Siaα2-3Galβ1-4(Fucα1-3)GlcNAc)1 (8Foxall C.

Thus, these structures appear to be biologically relevant only when presented in the context of certain intact glycoprotein ligand structures, and/or perhaps with further modification, such as sulfation (20Imai Y.

In this regard, we have suggested that SLex (and/or other sialylated or sulfated oligosaccharides) generate high-affinity ligands by forming unique “clustered saccharide patches” on heavily glycosylated molecules such as mucins (6Varki A.

We have previously reported the isolation of heparin-like molecules from calf pulmonary artery endothelial (CPAE) cells which bind to L-selectin in a calcium-dependent manner (24Norgard-Sumnicht K.E. Varki N.M. Varki A. Science. 1993; 261: 480-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). In independent work, Nelson et al.(25Nelson R.M. Cecconi O. Roberts W.G. Aruffo A. Linhardt R.J. Bevilacqua M.P. Blood. 1993; 82: 3253-3258Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) reported that fragments from commercial heparin as small as tetrasaccharides could block L- and P-selectin binding to SLex-bovine serum albumin, at concentrations far lower than those required for SLex itself. Thus, heparin-related structures may be another type of high affinity natural ligand for the selectins. Also, with regard to use as therapeutic blockers for selectins, these molecules might potentially be more useful than the sialylated, fucosylated polylactosamines. Here, we report the initial characterization of these heparin-like ligands from CPAE cells, aimed at understanding if unusual structure(s) present on the glycosaminoglycan (GAG) chains might account for their specific affinity for L-selectin. Our initial approach assumed the accuracy of current models for biosynthesis of heparin/heparan sulfate (HS) chains, which indicate that unsubstituted amino groups should not occur on the glucosamine residues of naturally occurring HS-GAG chains (26Kjellén L. Lindahl U. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1991; 60: 443-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (1660) Google Scholar, 27Esko J.D. Curr. Opin.

However, we show that these unusual residues do indeed exist in the L-selectin binding HS-GAGs of cultured endothelial cells. The involvement of the free amino groups in binding to L-selectin is also explored. Most of the materials used were obtained from Sigma. The following materials were obtained from the sources indicated: Arthrobacter ureafaciens neuraminidase (sialidase), Calbiochem; Proteinase K, Life Technologies, Inc.; [35S]sodium sulfate, ICN; trypsin-treated L-1-tosyl-amido-2-phenylethyl chloromethyl ketone, Worthington; diisopropylfluorophosphate, Aldrich; sulfo-NHS-biotin (an N-hydroxysuccinimide ester of biotin) and immuno pure avidin coupled to agarose, Pierce; and Centricon-3 Concentrators, Amicon. Purified heparin lyases (I, II, and III) and O-sialoglycoprotease were kind gifts from Dr. Robert Linhardt, University of Iowa, and Dr. Alan Mellors, University of Guelph, Canada, respectively.

All other chemicals were of reagent grade or better and were from commercial sources. CPAE cells, a calf pulmonary artery endothelial cell line, was from American Type Culture Collection (CCL 209) and were used at or before passage 23; HUVEC cells, human umbilical vein endothelial cells, were from Clonetics, San Diego, CA (CC-2008) and were used within the first three passages; CHOK1 cells were from ATCC (CCL 9618).

Sialidase digestions were done in a total volume of 10-15 μl of 100 mM sodium acetate pH 5.5 with 5 milliunits of A. ureafaciens neuraminidase (sialidase), at 37°C for 1 h. Proteinase K digestions were done with 0.65 mg of proteinase K in a total volume of 10 μl of 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.2, overnight at 37°C. 7.5% polyacrylamide gels were poured using a Bio-Rad Mini-Gel Apparatus as per the manufacturer's instructions. Samples were boiled in the presence of SDS and 2-mercaptoethanol (reduced), loaded in a total volume of 40 μl, and gels run at 100 V until the dye front reached the bottom of the gel. Prestained high molecular weight standards from Life Technologies, Inc. were included. Following fixation of the gel in 10% methanol, 10% acetic acid for 30 min and exposure to En3hance for 1 h as per the manufacturer's instructions, the gel was dried and exposed to X-MAT Kodak film at −80°C. CPAE cells at passage 10 were grown in 2 × 6-well plates to subconfluence (80%). Labeling with [35S]sodium sulfate was done in sulfate-limited media (media without cysteine and methionine and a total of 10 uM sodium sulfate as reported earlier (24Norgard-Sumnicht K.E. Varki N.M.

Some wells from each plate were also stimulated by addition of 1 μg of LPS (Sigma L-6018 from Escherichia coli 055:B5 γ -irradiated) at the time of addition of the [35S]sulfate (30Spertini O.

After an 8-h pulse, cells to be chased (1 plate) were washed three times with cold PBS and replenished with α-minimal essential media containing 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum for an overnight chase period. Cells from each of the four groups (“pulse” pulsed only; and “pulse/chase” pulsed with overnight chase; each with and without LPS stimulation) were either trypsinized or saponin-permeabilized. Cells were washed three times with ice-cold PBS, and 0.5 ml of PBS, 0.1% sodium azide containing 0.5 mg of trypsin-TPCK was added and incubated at room temperature for 15 min. The trypsin was inactivated by addition of 0.5 μl of 1 M diisopropylfluorophosphate (in a fume hood). The cells were then scraped into the buffer and the entire mixture centrifuged at 2000 revolutions/min for 15 min. The supernatant was analyzed as the trypsin-released fraction, and the remaining pellet was extracted with Triton-X as described below. Cells were washed three times with ice-cold PBS and 0.5 ml of PBS, 0.1% sodium azide containing the following: 5 mg of Saponin, 30 μg of pepstatin, 6% (v/v) aprotinin, and 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride was added to each well. After incubation on ice for 30 min, the cells were scraped into the buffer, and the entire mixture centrifuged at 2000 revolutions/min for 15 min. The supernatant was analyzed as the saponin-released fraction, and the remaining pellet was further extracted with Triton X-100 as described below. Each of the supernatants described above, as well as the chase media from each group, was analyzed by applying equivalent amounts of radioactivity (50,000 counts/min) onto an L-selectin affinity column (described below). The remaining pellets from the saponin and trypsin treatments were extracted with 0.5 ml of ice-cold PBS with 2% Triton X-100, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1% (v/v) aprotinin, 10 μg/ml pepstatin, 0.02% NaNγ on ice for 1 h with periodic vortexing. These samples were then transferred to ultracentrifuge tubes and spun at 13 K in a Ti 50.3 rotor (9500 × g) for 1 h. These supernatants (radioactivity remaining after saponin or trypsin) were taken into account when calculating the total radioactivity associated with cells, matrix, and media. To examine the extracellular matrix material only, a separate experiment was performed. A P-100 dish of CPAE cells at passage 10 was labeled with [35S]sodium sulfate as described above. After an 8-h pulse, the cells were washed with ice-cold PBS and the cells scraped from the plate using a rubber policeman. The plate was inspected to ensure that no cells remained on the plate and washed a further time with cold PBS. The remaining extracellular matrix was removed by adding 3 ml of 2% SDS in PBS and scraped and collected into a 15-ml glass conical tube. The GAG chains were then released as described below using method 1. Free GAG chains were released and purified using a modification of a previously reported method (32Britz J.S. Hart G.W. J.

Briefly, the samples, either before or after application to a L-selectin column, were digested overnight at 55°C with 1 mg/ml proteinase K in a buffer containing 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1% SDS, 0.1 M 2-mercaptoethanol. The SDS was precipitated by adding 1/100th volume of saturated KCl and the mixture left at 4°C overnight. The potassium SDS precipitate was spun out at 2000 revolutions/min for 15 min. The supernatant fluid was boiled for 15 min and DNase (final concentration 3 μg/ml) and MgCl2 (final concentration 100 mM) was added, and the mixture incubated at 37°C overnight. After boiling for 15 min, the mixture was extracted with 10 volumes of CHClγ /MeOH (2:1). The aqueous phase which contained the GAG glycopeptides was extensively dialyzed against water (Mr cutoff = 3500) and the sample lyophilized to dryness. For reductive β-elimination, 22.4 mg of NaBH4 was dissolved in 2 ml of 0.4 M NaOH, and 0.5 ml of this mixture was added to each sample (33Seno N. Sekizuka E. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1978; 83: 953-956Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). After incubation at room temperature overnight, the reaction was quenched by acidification with 1 M HCl followed by neutralization using 1 M NaOH. Excess borates and unreacted products were then removed by desalting using a Bio-Gel P-2 column pre-equilibrated and run in 10 mM sodium acetate, pH 5.5. The free GAG chains from the void volume of this column were then fractionated on an L-selectin affinity column as described below. A second method of GAG chain preparation and purification was employed as a check for the possibility of artifactual production of unsubstituted amino groups and is based on the protocol described by Bame and Esko (34Bame K.J. Esko J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 8059-8065Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, CPAE, HUVEC, and CHOK1 cells were labeled for 4 days with [6-3H]GlcNH2 in complete α-minimal essential media. Cells were then washed and solubilized with 0.1 M NaOH at room temperature for 15 min. The solubilized cell mixture was added to the labeling media and the pH adjusted to 7.0. Proteinase K was added at a final concentration of 0.134 mg/ml to each sample and incubated at 37°C overnight. The samples were then diluted 5-fold with water and the salt concentration lowered to 0.1 M (as checked with a Vapor Pressure Osmometer (5500XR, Wescor) against calibrated salt solutions). The samples were then applied to 1-ml DEAE-Sephacel columns and washed with 30 ml of 0.1 M NaCl, 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4. The GAG peptides were then eluted with 4 ml of 1 M NaCl, 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4. Reductive β-elimination was then done similarly to that described above. An equivalent volume of a 2 × NaOH/NaBH4 solution (2 × = 44.8 mg NaBH4, 2 ml of M NaOH) was added to each sample and the pH checked to be at 11.5. The samples were allowed to incubate 24 h at room temperature. They were then quenched by the addition of glacial acetic acid dropwise until bubbling stopped and left at room temperature for an additional 2 h for completion of quenching. The samples were then dialyzed extensively against H2O in dialysis bags with a molecular weight cutoff of 6,000-8000. As described previously (35Norgard K.E. Han H. Powell L. Kriegler M. Varki A. Varki N.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 1068-1072Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), the L-selectin receptor globulin (LS-Rg) consists of the entire extracellular domain of a human L-selectin molecule attached to a human IgG2 Fc COOH-terminal domain. The construct is expressed in 293 cells and isolated from the culture media using protein A-Sepharose. Typical affinity columns were constructed using 0.4-2.7 mg of purified LS-Rg immobilized by passage over a prepoured column of 2 ml of protein A-Sepharose. Ligands were bound to the columns in 100 mM NaCl, 20 mM MOPS, pH 7.4, 1 mM CaCl2, 1 mM MgCl2, and 0.02% sodium azide. Bound ligands were specifically eluted using the above binding buffer in which the CaCl2 and MgCl2 were replaced with 5 mM EDTA. Under all of these conditions, the LS-Rg itself remains attached to the protein A-Sepharose column. A Pharmacia Superose 12 HR 10/30 FPLC column was used both to size samples as well as to remove unreacted small products and reagents. The column was run isocratically in the same buffer used for the LS-Rg affinity column (see above), allowing for direct application of any isolated material to the latter. A Pharmacia FPLC system (P-LKB-Pump P-500; P-LKB-Controller LCC-500 Plus) was used to elute the column at 0.4 ml/min flow rate with an on-line Pharmacia LKB-Frac 100 fraction collector programmed to collect 1-min fractions after 15 min from the beginning of the run. Fractions that were to be studied analytically were collected directly into scintillation vials, 4 ml of Liquiscint scintillation mixture added, and the radioactivity determined. The elution profile of this column was highly reproducible from run to run, as determined by the markers blue dextran (void volume), [35S]sodium sulfate (total volume) and [3H]heparin octasaccharide standards (partially included). Nitrous acid degradation was performed by the method of Conrad et al.(36Shively J.E. Conrad H.E. Biochemistry. 1970; 9: 33-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 37Shively J.E. Conrad H.E.

Samples to be treated were either first dialyzed extensively against water or desalted using a Centricon-3 concentrator unit (spun with repeated applications of water washes 2-3 × 2 ml), dried completely, and chilled on ice. 30 μl of either the chilled nitrous acid reagent (see below) at pH 1.5 or pH 4.0 was then added, and the reaction brought to room temperature for 10 min, after which the solution was neutralized by addition of 5 μl of saturated Na2COγ , and the final volume adjusted to 200 μl with water. The sample was immediately applied onto the Superose 12 column as described above. For preparation of the pH 1.5 nitrous acid reagent, 0.5 M H2SO4 and 0.5 M Ba(NO2)2 were prepared fresh and cooled separately on ice. Equal volumes were then mixed together and spun in a microfuge to pellet the BaSO4 formed. The supernatant was aspirated and used immediately. For the pH 4.0 nitrous acid reagent, 5.5 M NaNO2 and 0.5 M H2SO4 were prepared fresh and cooled separately on ice. Five volumes of NaNO2 and 2 volumes of H2SO4 were then mixed on ice and used immediately. pH values of the nitrous acid reagent were checked before addition to the sample. For controls, 30 μl of the nitrous acid solutions actually used were first quenched with 5 μl of saturated Na2COγ , and the final volume adjusted to 200 μl with water before addition of the samples, which were then applied immediately to the Superose 12 columns. The samples to be N-reacetylated were desalted by either extensive dialysis against H2O or by centrifugation using a Centricon-3 concentrator unit (spun with repeated applications of water washes 2-3 × 2 ml), brought up in a total of 100 μl of H2O, and 12.5 μl of saturated NaHCOγ was added followed by 12.5 μl of freshly prepared, ice-cold 5% aqueous acetic anhydride while the mixture was vortexed. At 15-min intervals, additional aliquots of 12.5 μl of saturated NaHCOγ and 12.5 μl of fresh, ice-cold 5% aqueous acetic anhydride were added for 60-90 min. The sample was then directly injected onto the Superose 12 FPLC column as described above. Samples to be coupled to sulfo-NHS-biotin were extensively dialyzed against H2O to remove salts. Coupling was performed in 50 mM sodium borate in volumes ranging from 10 to 27 μl total. The sample was first brought up in the borate solution and then added to vials which had 0.1 mg of sulfo-NHS-biotin dried in them. (Because sulfo-NHS-biotin tends to degrade in aqueous solutions, the fresh solutions of the compound were quickly aliquoted into individual Eppendorf tubes, dried on a Savant Speed Vac apparatus, and then stored refrigerated with desiccation until use). Coupling was allowed to proceed overnight at 4°C. Two methods were used to separate unreacted sulfo-NHS-biotin from the reacted product. Small oligosaccharides or monosaccharides were spotted directly on Whatman no. 1 paper and run for 16 h in ethyl acetate/pyridine/acetic acid/water (5:5:1:3). The paper was then cut into 1-cm strips, eluted with H2O, and radioactivity determined. Large oligosaccharides were separated from unreacted sulfo-NHS-biotin by spinning the unreacted sulfo-NHS-biotin reagent through Centricon-3 concentrator units. The samples were washed with repeated applications of water (2-3 × 2 ml). Samples which had been coupled with sulfo-NHS-biotin and freed of excess reagents were allowed to interact with immobilized avidin-agarose beads. 200 μl of avidin-agarose was added to the sample brought up in 50 μl of sodium borate (50 mM final borate concentration).

OPN has at least two established biochemical activities. 1) OPN contains an Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) integrin recognition motif (2Young M.F. Kerr J.M. Termine J.D. Wewer U.M. Wang M.G. McBride O.W.

Butler W.T. Prince C.W. Bone Miner. 1993; 22: 147-159Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar), presumably by virtue of its high density of aspartic acid residues. OPN has roles in cellular transformation, tissue mineralization, and immune function that have been recently reviewed (14Patarca R. Saavedra R.A. Cantor H. Crit. Rev. Immunol. 1993; 13: 225-246PubMed Google Scholar, 15Denhardt D.T. Guo X. FASEB J. 1993; 7: 1475-1483Crossref PubMed Scopus (1001) Google ScholarBone is the organ system where OPN was first identified and where it almost certainly has an important role in development and homeostasis. OPN is a major noncollagenous protein in bone, and in developing bone it is localized at the interface of cartilage to bone transition (16Mark M.P. Butler W.T. Prince C.W. Finkelman R.D. Ruch J.V. Differentiation. 1988; 37: 123-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). The position of this protein and its highly acidic nature indicate that it could regulate the mineralization of bone. OPN also contains an RGD sequence that can bind to integrin adhesion receptors. Integrins are a large family of αβ heterodimers that mediate cellular adhesion and signaling (17Albelda S.M. Buck C.A. FASEB J. 1990; 4: 2868-2880Crossref PubMed Scopus (1622) Google Scholar, 18Hynes R.O. Cell. 1992; 69: 11-25Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (8966) Google Scholar). The interaction of OPN with integrin αvβ3has received much interest because the binding of these two proteins is thought to be essential for osteoclast adhesion to bone, an event that initiates bone resorption (19Horton M.A. Davies J. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1989; 4: 803-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). In fact, studies done in vitro lend strong support to this hypothesis because RGD peptides and monoclonal antibodies against αvβ3block bone resorption in culture models (20Chambers T.J. Fuller K. Darby J.A. Pringle J.A.S. Horton M.A. Bone Miner. 1986; 1: 127-135PubMed Google Scholar, 21Sato M. Sardana M.K. Grasser W.A. Garsky V.M. Murray J.M. Gould R.J. J.

Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 1817-1826Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). It has also been hypothesized that integrin αvβ3is a homing receptor that directs osteoclast precursors to OPN in bone matrix (19Horton M.A. Davies J. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1989; 4: 803-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Moreover, it has been suggested that the binding of soluble OPN to αvβ3on osteoclasts transduces signals that influence osteoclast function during bone resorption (10Miyauchi A. Alvarez J. Greenfield E.M. Teti A. Grano M. Colucci S. Zambonin-Zallone A. Ross F.P. Teitelbaum S.L. Cheresh D. Hruska K.A. J. Biol.

Physiol. 1994; : C376-C381Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Based on this collective body of data, it is reasonable to hypothesize that inhibitors of the interaction between OPN and integrin αvβ3could be applied to prevent osteoporosis.Although several studies have shown that OPN can mediate cell adhesion and signaling through integrin αvβ3(9Flores M.E. Norgard M. Heinegard D. Reinholt F.P. Andersson G. Exp. Cell Res. 1992; 201: 526-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 10Miyauchi A. Alvarez J. Greenfield E.M. Teti A. Grano M. Colucci S.

Res. 1992; 7: 335-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar), the binding affinity between these two proteins is not known. Thus, a major objective of this study was to measure the binding affinity between integrin αvβ3and OPN. Furthermore, both proteins contain multiple divalent ion binding motifs. These motifs are important to the function of αvβ3because ligands for this integrin can be placed into two categories, those whose binding is potentiated by Ca2+and those whose binding is blocked by Ca2+. Given that αvβ3and OPN interact at the bone surface, an environment subject to extremes in divalent ion, it is important to decide which category OPN is in. Thus, another goal of this study was to learn how divalent cations regulate binding between these two proteins. Our characterization was performed with UP, a native urinary form of OPN that is glycosylated and phosphorylated, and with a recombinant fragment of OPN (rOP27) consisting of residues 1-228. Our studies show that UP and rOP27 have comparable affinities for integrin αvβ3. However, neither protein can bind the homologous platelet integrin αIIbβ3. Both forms of OPN display identical abilities to support cell adhesion. In addition, our studies reveal that physiological levels of Ca2+significantly reduce the affinity of OPN for αvβ3and block cell adhesion. Consequently, regulation of OPN binding to integrin αvβ3by extracellular Ca2+appears to provide a new mechanism for the modulation of bone resorption.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESConstruction of Recombinant Osteopontin Expression VectorsThe cDNA encoding full-length human OPN was modified and inserted into a GST-based expression vector to generate recombinant osteopontin. A 510-base pair cDNA encoding base pairs 157-666 of human osteopontin was generated by polymerase chain reaction using the cDNA for OPN as a template. Importantly, this form of OPN contains the 14-amino acid sequence in the amino terminus that is known to be alternatively spliced (2Young M.F. Kerr J.M. Termine J.D. Wewer U.M. Wang M.G. McBride O.W. Fisher L.W. Genomics. 1990; 7: 491-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar, 8Kiefer M.C. Bauer D.M. Barr P.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 3306Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). The primers for this amplification were 1) 5′-G-GCT-CTA-GAC-ATA-CCA-GTT-AAA-CAG-GCT-GAT-TCT and 2) 5′-GTC-TGT-AGC-ATC-AGG-GTA-CTG-GAT (Integrated DNA Technologies, Inc). The 5′ primer contains an XbaI restriction site introduced for subcloning and the cDNA sequence encoding the first 10 amino acids of OPN. The 3′ primer is complementary to the cDNA sequence of OPN between base pairs 643 and 666. The polymerase chain reaction product was digested with XbaI, which cuts in the polymerase chain reaction primer, and with NdeI, which cuts internal to the polymerase chain reaction primer. The fragment was gel-purified and used to replace the corresponding DNA segment in the full-length human OPN cDNA. This procedure eliminated the eukaryotic signal sequence and introduced a 5′ XbaI site for further subcloning. The insert obtained was cloned into the Bluescript plasmid and the proper cDNA sequence of this construct (pBSrOP) was verified by dideoxy sequencing.To insert the cDNA for OPN into expression vectors, pBSrOP was excised with XbaI and XhoI and subcloned into the polylinker of pGEX(KG) distal to a polyglycine kinker (24Guan K. Dixon J.E. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 192: 262-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (1637) Google Scholar). The thrombin cleavage site of this vector was replaced with a Factor Xa site by subcloning a SmaI- XhoI fragment from this plasmid into the polylinker of pGEX-5x-1. The resulting construct, pGEXaOP encodes GST linked to the amino terminus of OPN by a polyglycine kinker and Factor Xa cleavage site. All designations for amino acid residues in this report use the isoleucine following the eukaryotic signal sequence as amino acid one.Purification of Recombinant OsteopontinTo express recombinant osteopontin as a fusion protein with GST, BL26 Escherichia coli. (Novagen, F−ompT hsdSB(rB−mB−) gal dcm lac) were transformed with pGEXaOP. Following selection of bacterial colonies producing the fusion protein, the transformants were allowed to grow until A600 approached 1 absorbance unit. Isopropyl-1-thio-β-D -galactopyranoside was added to a final concentration of 0.5 mM to induce expression of GST-OPN. After a 3-h fermentation at 37°C, cells were harvested and centrifuged at 5000 rpm at 4°C. Bacterial pellets were frozen at −70°C and thawed at room temperature. The bacterial pellet was suspended in TBS (50 mM Tris-HCl, 100 mM NaCl, pH 8.0), incubated on ice for 30 min with 2 mg/ml of lysozyme in the presence of phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (2.0 mM), benzamidine (5.0 mM), and EDTA (1 mM). Triton X-100 was added to the lysate to a final concentration of 1%. The suspension was pressed 4 times with a nitrogen bomb at 500 psi and then centrifuged at 12,000 rpm for 45 min. The supernatant containing the fusion protein was batch adsorbed to glutathione-agarose resin (Sigma) by rocking for 1.5 h at ambient temperature, and the resin was then washed with TBS containing protease inhibitors until the A280 returned to base line. The fusion protein was eluted with 5 mM glutathione (reduced form). GST-OPN was dialyzed against TBS.To cleave OPN from GST, the fusion protein was concentrated to 3-5 mg/ml using Aquacide and dialyzed against TBS, pH 8.1, containing 5 mM CaCl2. The GST-OPN was incubated with Factor Xa (bovine plasma, Pierce) at an enzyme to protein ratio of 1:200 at room temperature for 2 h. The cleaved product was separated on a DEAE column (10 × 100 mm, Protein-Pak AP-1, Waters), and recombinant osteopontin (rOPN) was eluted at 300 mM NaCl in a salt gradient of 100-800 mM. rOPN was further purified by a C4 reverse phase column (Vydac) eluting at 40% acetonitrile in a 5-45% gradient. The mass of rOPN was determined by electrospray mass spectroscopy. The amino-terminal amino acid sequence of rOPN was determined by automated Edman degradation and corresponded to the predicted amino terminus based on the position of the Factor Xa cleavage site.UP was purified under nondenaturing conditions from batches of human urine by monoclonal antibody affinity chromatography as described previously (3Shiraga H. Min W. VanDusen W.J. Claymen M.D. Miner D. Terrell C.H. Sherbotie J.R. Foreman J.W. Przysiecki C. Neilson E.G. Hoyer J.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 426-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). Importantly, amino acid sequence analysis shows that UP contains the 14 amino acids in the amino terminus of the molecule that can be alternatively spliced (2Young M.F. Kerr J.M. Termine J.D.

In addition, results from amino acid composition analysis of UP are generally consistent with the predicted composition of the full-length molecule (3Shiraga H. Min W. VanDusen W.J. Claymen M.D. Miner D. Terrell C.H. Sherbotie J.R. Foreman J.W. Przysiecki C. Neilson E.G. Hoyer J.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 426-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). The concentration of uropontin was determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay titration using standardized batches of UP. The concentration of the UP standards was determined by both Lowry protein determination and by the total content of amino acids as determined by the ninhydrin reaction after alkaline lysis. These two methods gave identical results, whereas protein assays based on Coomassie Blue dye binding greatly underestimated the protein content of samples of UP. UP concentration was also measured by optical density at 280 nm, from which an absorbance of 1.5 was found to correspond to 1 mg/ml of UP. Many studies in this report were done to compare the integrin binding function of UP and rOPN. Therefore, the concentrations of rOPN and UP were standardized by A280by assuming that this protein has an extinction coefficient of 1.5. Protein concentrations were also measured by the bicichonic protein assay (Pierce Chemical Co.), which yielded identical concentrations for both rOP27 and UP.Cell Adhesion AssaysThe ability of rOPN and UP to support cell adhesion was measured with M21 human melanoma cells, which express integrin αvβ3as the predominant RGD-sensitive integrin (25Cheresh D.A. Spiro R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 17703-17711Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Other studies were performed with MG63 human osteosarcoma cells, which also express αvβ3(26Lampugnani M.G. Bernasconi S. Neri P. Lozzi L. Gavazzi I. Marchisio P.C. Dejana E. Lab. Invest. 1991; 65: 96-103PubMed Google Scholar, 27Oldberg A. Franzen A. Heinegard D. Pierschbacher M. Ruoslahti E. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 19433-19436Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The method for cell adhesion assays has been previously reported (28Smith J.W. Piotrowicz R.S. Mathis D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 960-967Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were harvested from tissue culture flasks with 200 μM EDTA and resuspended in adhesion buffer (Hanks' balanced salt solution, 50 mM Hepes, pH 7.4, containing 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin) containing 0.5 mM Mn2+. Cells (1.5 × 106cells/ml) were added to wells coated with a concentration range of rOP27 or UP. Following a 90-min incubation at 37°C, nonadherent cells were removed by gentle aspiration and washing. Adherent cells were detected by colorimetric assay for lysosomal acid phosphatase (29Pratner C.A. Plotkin J. Jaye D. Frazier W.A. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 112: 1031-1040Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). A standard curve with cells in suspension showed that all absorbance values were directly proportional to cell number.Binding Studies With Purified αvβ3 and αIIbβ3The ability of rOPN and UP to bind integrins αvβ3and αIIbβ3was measured using purified receptor-ligand binding assays as described previously (28Smith J.W. Piotrowicz R.S. Mathis D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 960-967Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). UP and rOP27 were radiolabeled with 125INa using Iodogen (Peirce Chemical Co.). Typical specific activities were 3-7 × 104cpm/ng of protein. For binding assays, purified integrin was immobilized in a 96-well Titertek microtiter wells at a coating concentration of 50 ng/well. After incubation overnight at 4°C, nonspecific protein binding sites on the plate were blocked with 20 mg/ml of bovine serum albumin and 1 mM desired metal ion(s) in TBS. To measure binding to immobilized integrins, 125IrOP27 or 125I-UP were added to the plate and incubated for 3 h at 37°C. Free ligand was removed by three rapid washes with TBS. The ligand-integrin complex was solubilized from the wells with 2 N boiling NaOH, and the radioactivity of the solution from each well was determined by γ counting. Nonspecific binding was determined by competition with either 50 μM GRGDSP or 5 mM EDTA and is subtracted from the total counts to yield counts for specific binding. Nonspecific binding was typically 7-9% of the total radioactivity bound to the immobilized receptor.Surface Plasmon Resonance MeasurementsSurface plasmon resonance (SPR) is a means of assessing receptor-ligand affinities in real time (30Altschuh D. Dubs M.-C. Weiss E. Zeder-Lutz G. Van Regenmortel M.H.V. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 6298-6304Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 31Fagerstam L.G. Frostell-Karlsson A. Karlsson R. Persson B. Ronnberg I. J. Chromatogr. 1992; 597: 397-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar). SPR was performed using the BIAcore instrument from Pharmacia Biotech Inc. Initial studies showed that OPN binding could not be detected by SPR when the integrin was immobilized on the sensor chip. Neither rOP27 nor UP could be immobilized on the chip presumably because their low isoelectric point caused electrostatic repulsion between the protein and the negatively charged dextrin surface of the sensor chip. However, the use of the fusion protein GST-OPN allowed successful immobilization of the osteopontin moiety. We presume that the fusion protein was coupled to the sensor chip through the GST moiety. It should be noted that cell adhesion and solid phase binding assays showed that GST-OPN has identical activity to rOP27 and that GST alone had no ability to bind integrin αvβ3(data not shown). GST-OPN were immobilized on the biosensor chip by the methods outlined by Pharmacia. At the end of each measurement, the sensorchip surface was regenerated with 0.5 ML-arginine. GST-OPN on the surface remained active throughout all the measurements. The on- and off-rate constants (k1and k−1) between αvβ3and GST-OPN were obtained from BIAcore measurements as follows. To obtain the association rate constant, k1, a range of integrin αvβ3, [I], was passed through the sensor chip coupled with GST-OPN. Response units (RU) were measured as a function of time. Plots of d(RU)/ dt against RU at different receptor concentrations generated a series of lines with different slopes (Equation 1). The latter is proportional to the concentration of receptor. Therefore, by plotting the slopes of these lines as a function of receptor concentration, a new line is obtained with a slope corresponding to k1(Equation 2). d(RU)/dt=Constant-(k1⋅[I]+k-1)⋅(RU)(Eq. 1) Slope=k1⋅[I]+k-1(Eq. 2) In each case, at least four concentration of ɑvβ3 were used for the measurement. For k1 measurements, the error was typically less than 10% across several ligand concentrations.To measure k−1, a pulse containing αvβ3was passed through the sensor chip. The change in response unit was measured and recorded. At the end of the association phase, the flow was changed to buffer lacking integrin, allowing the bound αvβ3to dissociate from GST-OPN. The off-rate constant k−1is derived from Equation 3. k-1=(ln(RU1/RUn))/(tn-t1)(Eq. 3) RU1 is the response unit at an arbitrary start time t1 of dissociation phase and RUn is the response unit at time tn of dissociation, Duplicate measurements of k-1 yielded identical values in all cases. The overall binding affinity, indicated by the dissociation constant kd, is derived by simple division shown in Equation 4. Kd=k-1/k1(Eq. 4) RESULTSExpression of Recombinant Human Osteopontin in E. coliThe pGEXaOP vector was constructed to enable expression of OPN in E. coli as a fusion protein with glutathione S-transferase. This strategy enabled the purification of OPN under nondenaturing conditions using a glutathione affinity column. Since a thrombin cleavage site is present near the RGD sequence of OPN, the previous use of thrombin to liberate rOPN from GST yielded two inactive fragments of OPN (32Xuan J.W. Hota C. Chambers A. J. Cell. Biochem. 1994; 54: 247-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Therefore, we engineered a GST-OPN fusion protein containing a factor Xa cleavage site and a “glycine kinker” (24Guan K. Dixon J.E. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 192: 262-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (1637) Google Scholar) to facilitate proteolytic cleavage between GST and OPN while avoiding cleavage near the RGD motif.The pGEXaOP plasmid was used to transform the lon and ampT protease-deficient E. coli strain BL26. Following induction with isopropyl-1-thio-β-D-galactopyranoside, the GST-OPN fusion protein was typically expressed at between 2 and 10 mg/liter. GST-OPN was purified by affinity chromatography on glutathione-Sepharose. Analysis of the fusion protein by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis showed it migrated at a position of 85 kDa (Fig. 1 A, lane 2). The rOPN was cleaved from GST using Factor Xa. rOPN was purified from GST by chromatography on DEAE, yielding rOPN that was approximately 85% pure (Fig. 1 A, lane 3). The remaining minor contaminants were removed by chromatography on a C4 reverse-phase column. The final rOPN was greater than 95% pure (Fig. 1 A, lane 4) and yielded a single amino-terminal amino acid sequence corresponding to the residues on the carboxyl-terminal side of the Factor Xa cleavage site in the fusion protein.Although rOPN migrated at 60 kDa on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis after cleavage from GST, mass spectroscopy showed the mass to be 27,046 Da (Fig. 1 B), thus it is designated as rOP27. Amino-terminal sequence analysis showed the amino terminus to be intact, so this form of OPN is truncated on the carboxyl-terminal side of Arg228. The inability to generate a full-length form of OPN in E. coli is not entirely unexpected because OPN is known to be highly sensitive to proteolysis (see “Discussion”).UP and rOP27 Have Equivalent Adhesive Capacity and Similar Affinity for Integrin αvβ3To evaluate the ability of rOP27 to support cell adhesion, its adhesive activity was compared with that of native human uropontin. Uropontin is identical in amino acid sequence and composition to osteopontin but is purified from urine under nondenaturing conditions (3Shiraga H. Min W. VanDusen W.J. Claymen M.D. Miner D. Terrell C.H. Sherbotie J.R. Foreman J.W. Przysiecki C. Neilson E.G. Hoyer J.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 426-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). A concentration range of rOP27 and UP were coated onto microtiter wells, and the ability of M21 melanoma cells to adhere to each protein was assessed. The major RGD-binding integrin on M21 cells is αvβ3(25Cheresh D.A. Spiro R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 17703-17711Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The data in Fig. 2 A show that UP and rOP27 support the adhesion of M21 melanoma cells equivalently. We also found that Fab-9, a function-blocking antibody directed to the ligand binding pocket of αvβ3(33Barbas C.F. Languino L. Smith J.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; (in press)Google Scholar), abolished adhesion to OPN proving that adhesion is mediated by αvβ3(data not shown). Additionally, all adhesion to OPN was blocked by synthetic RGD peptides. Identical results were obtained with several of other human cell lines including MG63 osteosarcoma cell, which also express integrin αvβ3.Figure 2:Comparison of the adhesive activity and integrin binding ability of rOP27 and UP. A, the ability of rOP27 to support cell adhesion was compared with that of UP using M21 melanoma cells as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Each data point was measured in quadruplicate, and the average is shown. This experiment was performed 6 times with identical results. B, a purified ligand-receptor binding assay was performed to compare the integrin binding ability of rOP27 with that of UP. 125I-rOP27 (0.2 μg/well) was added to microtiter wells coated with purified integrin αvβ3(50 ng/well). The binding of 125I-rOP27 was challenged with a concentration range of unlabeled rOP27 (○) and UP (△). Nonspecific binding determined in the presence of 50 mM RGD was deduced from the total binding. The data are an average of triplicate measurements. This experiment was performed five times with identical results.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Results from our analysis with M21 melanoma cells and from previous studies (10Miyauchi A.

https://openalex.org/W1971753852,"Implanting mouse blastocysts adhere through their abembryonic surfaces to the endometrial extraceUular matrix. Because blastocysts cultured on fibronectin in vitro dissociate to form trophoblast outgrowths, it is unclear whether this adhesion is initially mediated by fibronectin receptors on the apical or basolateral surface of the trophectoderm. Intact blastocysts were examined in a ligand binding assay utilizing the fibronectin cell binding domain attached to fluorescent microspheres. Fibronectin binding activity on the apical surface of the trophectoderm was confined to the abembryonic pole of the blastocyst, where trophoblast differentiation initiates, and was regulated temporally in accordance with blastocyst outgrowth. Soluble fibronectin (IC50, = 0.2 µm) or Gly-Arg-Gly-Asp-Ser-Pro, but not laminin, competitively inhibited fibronectin binding activity. Addition of antibodies against the αv, α5, β1, or β3 integrin subunits also inhibited binding activity. Blastocysts cultured in the absence of an adhesive substratum exhibited fibronectin binding activity only after exposure to immobilized or soluble ligand. Potentiation of binding activity by ligand was unaffected by cycloheximide but was sensitive to brefeldin A inhibition of protein trafficking. These findings suggest that the interaction of fibronectin with the trophectoderm induces a translocation event that up-regulates fibronectin binding β1- and β3-class integrins on the apical surface.

Interstitial implantation in humans and mice comprises a complex interaction between the primary trophoblast cells of the differentiating blastocyst and the endometrial ECM 1The abbreviations used are: ECM, extracellular matrix; FN-120, 120-kDa fibronectin central cell binding fragment; FN-50, 50-kDa NH3-terminal portion of FN-120 lacking the RGD site; FN-45, 45-kDa gelatin binding fragment; FN-40, 40-kDa high affinity heparin binding fragment; α1-AG, α1-acid glycoprotein; hPBS, high phosphate saline solution; BSA, bovine serum albumin; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline.. At the onset of implantation, the mural trophectoderm of the blastocyst comes into intimate contact with the uterine epithelial cells that eventually slough away, allowing the trophoblast cells to contact the basement membrane, penetrate it, and invade the underlying stroma (Schlafke and Enders, 1975Schlafke S.

The outgrowth of primary trophoblast cells from cultured blastocysts is believed to reflect differentiation of the embryo, leading to trophoblast invasion of the endometrial stroma during implantation in utero (Sherman, 1975Sherman M.I.

Biol. 1986; 116: 519-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar by a mechanism that remains to be elucidated. Fibronectin is a multi-functional ECM glycoprotein that plays a central role in cell adhesion and is thought to regulate cellular polarity, differentiation, and growth (Ruoslahti, 1988Ruoslahti E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1988; 57: 375-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (1059) Google Scholar). Increased fibronectin synthesis accompanies ECM remodeling within the uterine endometrium in preparation for implantation (Rider et al., 1992Rider V. Carlone D.L. Witrock D. Cai C. Oliver N. Dev. Dyn. 1992; 195: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar. Fibronectin can be cleaved by controlled proteolysis into several functional domains that bind fibrin, heparin, collagen, DNA, and various cell surface receptors (Pierschbacher et al., 1981Pierschbacher M.D. Hayman E.G. Ruoslahti E. Cell. 1981; 26: 259-267Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar; Ruoslahti, 1988Ruoslahti E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1988; 57: 375-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (1059) Google Scholar). A fibronectin receptor has been identified in several cell lines by affinity chromatography on a 120-kDa fragment of fibronectin (FN-120) containing the central cell binding domain and specific elution with a synthetic peptide containing an Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) sequence (Pytela et al., 1985Pytela R. Pierschbacher M.D. Ruoslahti E. Call. 1985; 40: 191-198Scopus (688) Google Scholar; Cardarelli and Pierschbacher, 1987Cardarelli P.M. Pierschbacher M.D. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 499-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). This fibronectin receptor is now known to be a member of the integrin family of integral membrane proteins (Ruoslahti, 1988Ruoslahti E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1988; 57: 375-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (1059) Google Scholar; Hynes, 1992Hynes R.O. Cell. 1992; 69: 11-25Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (9026) Google Scholar). The integrins are a family of about 20 heterodimeric glycoprotein receptors that consist of a 120–180-kDa α-subunit and a 90–110-kDa β-subunit. In addition to mediating cellular adhesion to ECM components, integrins also play important roles in cell-cell adhesion, the immune response, cell differentiation, thrombosis, and inflammation (Hynes, 1992Hynes R.O. Cell. 1992; 69: 11-25Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (9026) Google Scholar). Several integrins bind fibronectin through the RGD site in the central cell binding domain or through non-RGD sites located in an alternatively spliced IIICS domain (Hynes, 1992Hynes R.O. Cell. 1992; 69: 11-25Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (9026) Google Scholar). Mouse primary trophoblast cells appear to interact with fibronectin exclusively through the RGD recognition site (Armant et al., 1986bArmant D.R. Kaplan H.A. Mover H. Lennarz W.J. Proc. Natl. Acad.

Less typical of epithelial cells is the role of the apical trophectoderm surface in adhesion to ECM. ECM receptors, such as the integrins α5β1 and α6β1, are restricted to the basolateral surface, although αvβ3 has been observed at the apical surface of mouse blastocysts (Sutherland et al., 1993Sutherland A.E. Calarco P.G. Damsky C.H. Development. 1993; 119: 1175-1186Crossref PubMed Google Scholar. In vivo, after apoptosis of the epithelial cells, the blastocyst contacts the surrounding uterine basement membrane through the apical surfaces of its trophoblast cells and adheres to a matrix that, unlike a culture plate, is neither inflexible nor flat (Schlafke and Enders, 1975Schlafke S. Enders A.E. Biol. Reprod. 1975; 12: 41-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar). The dissociation and outgrowth of trophoblast giant cells in vitro is therefore morphologically abnormal. It is unclear whether primary trophoblast adhesion in vitro is initially mediated by receptors on the apical surface of adhesion-competent blastocysts or by receptors at the basolateral surface that gain access to the culture plate as the blastocyst dissociates. To address this question, we have developed a novel ligand binding assay to quantify and localize fibronectin binding activity on the apical surface of differentiating trophoblast cells comprising the intact blastocyst. Fibronectin binding activity was characterized biochemically during blastocyst differentiation, focusing on the central cell binding domain represented by FN-120. We now report that fibronectin binding activity is both temporally and spatially regulated by integrins on the apical surface of cells comprising the trophectoderm of the developing peri-implantation blastocyst. Proteolytic fragments of fibronectin, including the 120-kDa central cell binding fragment (FN-120), the 50-kDa NH3-terminal portion of FN-120 lacking the RGD site (FN-50), the 45-kDa gelatin binding fragment (FN-45), and the 40-kDa high affinity heparin binding fragment (FN-40), were all purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. and have been previously characterized (Pierschbacher et al., 1981Pierschbacher M.D. Hayman E.G.

A polyclonal antiserum to the mouse β1 integrin subunit (Ab3675) was a generous gift from Dr. Steven Akiyama (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD). Non-immune rat and hamster IgG was purchased from Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories (West Grove, PA). Non-immune rabbit serum was from Sigma. Mouse blastocyst stage embryos were generated as previously described (Yelian et al., 1993Yelian F.D. Edgeworth N.E. Dong L.J. Chung A.E. Armant D.R. J.

Blastocysts were collected on gestational day 4 (day 1 = day of vaginal plug) by flushing the uterine horns with pre-warmed HEPES-buffered Eagle's medium (Sigma) supplemented with 2 mg/ml calcium lactate, 60 µg/ml sodium pyruvate, 0.3 mg/ml glutamine, 4 mg/ml BSA, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin. Blastocysts were transferred by micropipette to pre-warmed Ham's F-10 medium supplemented with 4 mg/ml BSA, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin (all from Sigma) on plastic Petri dishes (Falcon 1008, Falcon Labware, Oxnard, CA) flooded with water-extracted (1:10) light mineral oil (Aldrich) to prevent evaporation. Culture medium was changed daily. All embryo culture was carried out in a 5% CO2 incubator at 37 °C. Blastocyst outgrowths were produced in serum-free Ham's medium by culture on plates precoated with 50 µg/ml fibronectin, as previously detailed (Armant et al., 1986aArmant D.R. Kaplan H.A.

Blastocyst attachment to the culture plate surface was quantified by noting whether the embryos moved while media was gently blown across the embryo using a micropipette. Trophoblast adhesion and cell migration, associated with blastocyst outgrowth, were distinguished from attachment by microscopically visualizing a spreading monolayer of cells around the embryo and disappearance of the spherical blastocyst morphology, as previously described (Armant et al., 1986bArmant D.R.

Fluoresbrite™ YG polystyrene fluorescent microspheres (1.0 µm, Polysciences, Warrington, PA) were first vigorously washed to completely remove surfactants used in their manufacture that may inhibit protein adsorption (Bangs, 1990Bangs L.B. Am. Clin. Lab. News Ed. 1990; 9: 16-17PubMed Google Scholar). A 2.5% solution of microspheres was washed five times by centrifugation for 5 min at 6000 × g in a high phosphate saline solution (hPBS) that consisted of 0.1 m NaCl, 0.0027 m KCl, 0.005 m Na2PO4, 0.0085 m KH2PO4, and 0.05 m NaH2PO4, pH 7.4, and resuspended to 2.5% in fresh hPBS. The washed microspheres were centrifuged, resuspended in an equal volume of hPBS containing 144 µg/ml FN-120 or α1-AG (Sigma), and incubated at room temperature for 24 h with continuous agitation on a vortex mixer. The microspheres were then washed five times in hPBS by centrifugation, as described above. To saturate all remaining protein binding sites on the microspheres, they were incubated overnight at room temperature with 1 mg/ml α1-AG while being continuously agitated. Finally, the microspheres were washed in hPBS five times by centrifugation and stored at 4 °C as a 2.5% suspension. For use in an assay, the microspheres were diluted to the desired final concentration in PBS containing 10 mg/ml BSA (PBS/BSA). FN-120-coated fluorescent microspheres were used to semi-quantitatively assay fibronectin binding activity of differentiating mouse blastocysts cultured for 48 or 72 h on a non-adhesive (BSA) surface. Blastocyst fibronectin binding activity was potentiated with immobilized ligand by culturing the embryos in Ham's medium at 37 °C on plates precoated with 50 µg/ml FN-120. Embryos were then carefully removed from the plate surface with a micropipette, and any outgrowing or damaged blastocysts were discarded. For potentiation using soluble ligand, the embryos were cultured on BSA-coated plates at 37 °C in medium supplemented with 50 µg/ml FN-120. Initial experiments (see “Results”) revealed that the accumulation of heparan sulfate proteoglycans on cultured blastocysts caused protein-coated microspheres to nonspecifically bind to the surface of the embryos. To remove heparan sulfate, blastocysts were incubated for 30 min at 37 °C in Hanks’ balanced salt solution with 1 unit/ml each of heparinases I, II, and III (Sigma, H2519, H6512, and H8891, respectively) prior to the binding assay. The binding assay was carried out by incubating embryos in 10-µl drops containing protein-coated microspheres for 30 min at 4 °C. In competitive inhibition assays, blastocysts were pre-exposed to the soluble competitor diluted in PBS/BSA for 30 min at 4 °C prior to incubation with microspheres. In EDTA inhibition experiments, blastocysts were incubated with 5 mm EDTA in PBS/BSA for 15 min at 4 °C and washed free of the EDTA before assay. EDTA-treated blastocysts were subsequently incubated for an additional 30 min at 4 °C in PBS/BSA containing 0–10 mm CaCl2, MgCl2, or MnCl2 and then washed in PBS/BSA. Following incubation with the microspheres, the blastocysts were washed free of unbound microspheres by pipetting through five drops of ice-cold PBS/BSA. The washed blastocysts were fixed in PBS containing 2% paraformaldehyde (Polysciences, Inc.) for 2 h at 4 °C and stored refrigerated in PBS/BSA containing 0.1% sodium azide for subsequent image analysis. The microspheres bound to each blastocyst were observed using a Leitz (Wetzlar, Germany) Fluovert FU inverted epifluorescence microscope, exciting the fluorescent microspheres at 450–490 nm. The amount of microsphere binding was quantified over either the embryonic or abembryonic pole of each blastocyst using a computer-based image analysis system. Embryos were oriented with their inner cell masses to one side and viewed using a 25 × objective. The fluorescent images were monitored using a Dage-MTI (Michigan City, Indiana) CCD 72 video camera, adjusted to electronically reverse the image and generate a relative optical density that was equivalent to the fluorescence intensity. The black level of the camera was set to 70 and the polarity was optimized to obtain a background reading of zero. Electronic images were transmitted to a Dell (Austin, TX) 486sx computer with MCID-M4 image analysis software (Imaging Research Inc., St. Catherines, Ontario) and displayed in pseudo-color corresponding to the relative optical density, which was found in preliminary experiments to be directly related to the number of microspheres present (data not shown). Ten equally spaced relative optical density values were averaged along the in-focus edge of each digitized image over 180° of either the embryonic or abembryonic pole using a small square tool projected by the imaging system and positioned with a computer mouse. Each data point, reported as mean ± S.E., represents the average relative fluorescence intensities pooled from at least three experiments that each included at least five embryos. To determine how rapidly cycloheximide inhibited new protein synthesis, blastocysts were prelabeled with 13.6 µm [35S]methionine (160 µCi/mmol) for 1 h at 37 °C and then exposed to 10 µg/ml cycloheximide. Groups of embryos were periodically removed, and radiolabeled proteins were precipitated from cell extracts with trichloroacetic acid. Washed blastocysts were spotted on Gelman (Ann Arbor, MI) glass fiber filters and placed in 10% trichloroacetic acid for 10 min at 4 °C with agitation. The filters were then transferred to boiling 5% trichloroacetic acid for 3 min. The filters were sequentially washed with 95% ethanol, 95% ethanol/acetone (1:1), and finally acetone, each for 5 min at room temperature. The filters were allowed to air dry for 2 h and then placed in scintillation vials containing 2 ml of Scintisol scintillation liquid (Isolab Inc., Akron OH). The radioactivity was then determined using a Taurus Automatic Liquid Scintillation Counter (ICN Micromedic Systems, Huntsville, AL). Preliminary experiments revealed that the abembryonic pole of the mouse blastocyst bound FN-120-coated microspheres in a concentration-dependent manner, whereas microspheres coated with the blocking protein α1-AG did not bind. However, in competition assays, binding was equally inhibited by soluble fibronectin, FN-120, and heparan sulfate (data not shown). We suspected that the observed binding of the microspheres was mediated by heparan sulfate, which accumulates at the blastocyst surface (Farach et al., 1987Farach M.C. Tang J.P. Decker G.L. Carson D.D. Dev. Biol. 1987; 123: 401-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar. To determine whether heparan sulfate proteoglycans were responsible for the observed binding, we measured the binding of FN-120-coated microspheres over the course of blastocyst differentiation with and without exposure to heparinase. A gradual increase was observed in microsphere binding on the surface of the embryos between 24 and 48 h of culture, followed by a rapid decrease at 52 h (Fig. 1A). Conversely, the group exposed to heparinase displayed little binding throughout. Therefore, it appeared that microsphere binding was, in fact, due to the expression of heparan sulfate. As shown in Fig. 1B, blastocyst attachment mirrored the pattern of heparan sulfate-mediated binding, whereas blastocyst outgrowth correlated temporally with the loss of heparan sulfate between 48 h and 72 h. Blastocyst attachment occurred transiently on BSA-coated surfaces, perhaps due to the presence of strongly charged heparan sulfate groups. These results suggested that proteoglycans on the surface of the mouse embryo may mediate the initial attachment of the blastocyst to the substratum, while adhesion and cell migration proceed through a more specific ligand-mediated mechanism. Accordingly, in all subsequent experiments, embryos were treated with heparinase prior to incubation with microspheres to specifically assay fibronectin binding activity. Normally, blastocysts collected on gestation day 4 and cultured on fibronectin-coated surfaces begin to adhere and outgrow within 72 h (Fig. 1B) (Armant et al., 1986aArmant D.R. Kaplan H.A. Lennarz W.J. Deo. Biol. 1986; 116: 519-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar. However, as suggested by Fig. 1A, when embryos cultured 72 h on BSA were assayed with FN-120-coated fluorescent microspheres, no appreciable fibronectin binding activity was detected (Fig. 2B). To determine whether the adhesiveness of the apical trophoblast surface could be potentiated by exposure to fibronectin, blastocysts cultured for 72 h without an adhesive substrate were incubated on Petri plates precoated with FN-120 for 3 h, carefully removed before they began to adhere, and assayed for their ability to bind FN-120-coated microspheres. Using this protocol, FN-120 bound to the abembryonic surface of blastocysts (Fig. 2D), where mouse trophoblast differentiation initiates (Dickson, 1963Dickson A.D. J. Reprod. Fértil. 1963; 6: 465-466Crossref PubMed Google Scholar; Kirby et al., 1967Kirby D.R. Potts D.M. Wilson I.B. J. Embryol. Exp. Morphol. 1967; 17: 527-532PubMed Google Scholar. Embryos that were cultured for 48 h and then similarly potentiated with FN-120 bound considerably less FN-120 (Fig. 2F), correlating with the relatively low rate of outgrowth found at this earlier developmental stage (Fig. 1B). Quantification of the fibronectin binding activity of blastocysts cultured for both 48 and 72 h by image analysis revealed that binding activity at the embryonic pole of ligand-potentiated blastocysts was almost undetectable (Fig. 3A). However, low levels of FN-120 binding to the abembryonic pole of ligand-potentiated blastocysts were detectable at 48 h and were approximately 6 times greater at 72 h (Fig. 3A).FIG. 3Developmental regulation and specificity of microsphere binding. A, microspheres coated with FN-120 were incubated with blastocysts cultured 48 or 72 h on BSA and then 3 h on plates coated with FN-120, as in Fig. 2, C–F. The fluorescence intensity of the bound microspheres was then quantified along the embryonic (solid bars) or abembryonic (open bars) pole of each embryo by image analysis. B, blastocysts cultured on BSA for 72 h and treated as indicated in Fig. 2, C and D, were incubated at 4 °C in various concentrations of fluorescent microspheres coated with FN-120 (□) or α1-AG (○). The fluorescence intensity of the bound microspheres was quantified along the abembryonic pole of each embryo by image analysis. Microspheres containing FN-120 bound to the embryos in a concentration-dependent manner up to 0.5% and then began to show signs of saturation. The blocking protein, α1-AG, did not mediate significant binding of the microspheres.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The relationship of FN-120 binding activity to microsphere concentration was determined over the mural trophectoderm of blastocysts cultured for 72 h, demonstrating a linear relationship with microsphere concentration up to a point approaching saturation (Fig. 3B). Microspheres containing only the blocking protein α1-AG did not significantly bind to the embryos (Fig. 3B). Based on these binding kinetics, a microsphere concentration of 0.2% was chosen for all subsequent ligand binding assays to work within a range that was linear with microsphere concentration. Biochemical characterization of the fibronectin binding activity along the abembryonic surface of blastocysts cultured for 72 h was consistent with trophoblast adhesive behavior during culture on fibronectin. Binding was inhibited by addition of soluble fibronectin or FN-120 but not by fragments representing other functional domains of fibronectin or by heparan sulfate (Fig. 4A). The concentration of intact fibronectin required to produce 50% inhibition of binding (IC50) was 0.2 µm, while FN-120 had an IC50 of 0.8 µm. Soluble laminin did not compete with binding by the FN-120-coated microspheres (Fig. 4A), supporting our earlier position (Armant et al., 1986bArmant D.R. Kaplan H.A. Mover H. Lennarz W.J. Proc.

Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 923-929Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar that fibronectin and laminin mediate trophoblast adhesion through separate receptors. To determine whether the fibronectin binding activity of blastocysts was mediated by the RGD recognition site, competitive inhibition assays were performed using the synthetic peptides GRGDSP and GRADSP. GRGDSP inhibited FN-120-coated microsphere binding to embryos in a dose-dependent manner, while the control peptide, GRADSP, demonstrated no ability to inhibit binding over the same concentration range (Fig. 4B). The fibronectin binding activity of blastocysts cultured for 72 h therefore appeared to be specifically mediated by the RGD recognition sequence. Inhibition of fibronectin binding activity by GRGDSP suggested a likely role for integrins. Also in support of the idea that the fibronectin receptors were integrins, w"

Mitotic dephosphorylation of Tyr-527 is accompanied by an increased ability of the c-Src SH2 domain, which is otherwise occupied by phosphorylated Tyr-527 in an intramolecular interaction, to bind to tyrosine-phosphorylated ligands (4Bagrodia S.

Peptides derived from purified Sam 68 revealed that it was closely related to the product of a gene, previously cloned as encoding GAP-associated p62 (7Wong G. Müller O. Clark R. Conroy L. Moran M.F. Polakis P. McCormick F. Cell. 1992; 69: 551-558Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). However, important differences in immunoreactivity, protein and nucleic acid binding, and electrophoretic mobility have distinguished the 62-kDa tyrosine-phosphorylated protein associated with Ras GAP from Sam 68 (5, 6, 8, 9, and this report). Sam 68 was able to bind to RNA homopolymers, specifically poly(U), in vitro (5Taylor S.J. Shalloway D. Nature. 1994; 368: 867-871Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar).

Src associated in mitosis (68 kDa) GTPase-activating protein glutathione S-transferase phosphotyrosine. Intracellular signal transduction involves the transient or stable formation of highly specific protein-protein interactions, which are mediated by protein modules, paradigms of which are SH2 and SH3 domains (13Pawson T.

SH2 domains bind to phosphotyrosine (PTyr)-containing peptides in a sequence-specific manner and mediate the recruitment of SH2-containing target proteins to tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins such as activated growth factor receptors. Phosphopeptide binding to SH2 domains can also regulate enzymatic activity. For instance, intramolecular binding of phosphorylated Tyr-527 to the c-Src SH2 domain represses its tyrosine kinase activity (4Bagrodia S. Laudano A.P. Shalloway D. J. Biol.

Human Crk (N) SH3 (residues 133-184) was constructed by cloning the relevant fragment produced by polymerase chain reaction into the BamHI- EcoRI sites of pGEX 2T. GST fusion proteins were purified from isopropyl-1-thio-β-D-galactopyranoside-induced Escherichia coli lysates with glutathione-Sepharose beads. Purified fusion proteins were eluted from the beads with 5 mM glutathione, 50 mM Tris-Cl, pH 8, 100 mM NaCl. Glutathione was removed by gel filtration on desalting columns, and the protein concentrations of purified, soluble fusion proteins were determined. Cell lines overexpressing wild type c-Src (NIH(pMcsrc/foc)B), partially activated c-Src(RF) (NIH(pR148416/pSV2neo/cos)E), and fully activated c-Src (F527) (NIH(pcsrc527/foc/ep)B1) have been described (5Taylor S.J. Shalloway D. Nature. 1994; 368: 867-871Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). Homogenization of cells and incubation of homogenates in the presence of 5 mM EDTA was as described (30Bagrodia S. Taylor S.J. Shalloway D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 1464-1470Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), except that cells were collected by trypsinization rather than scraping, and subcellular fractionation was not performed. After incubation for 45 min at 37°C, homogenates (400 μl) were incubated for 15 min at room temperature in the presence or absence of 10 mM MgCl2(5 mM free Mg2+)/1 mM ATP. Homogenates were solubilized by addition of an equal volume of 2× concentrated 3T3 lysis buffer (5Taylor S.J. Shalloway D. Nature. 1994; 368: 867-871Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). Cell lysis, immunoprecipitations, and immunoblotting were as previously described (5Taylor S.J. Shalloway D. Nature. 1994; 368: 867-871Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). An anti-Sam 68 rabbit antiserum was generated against peptide C corresponding to the 11 carboxyl-terminal residues of the human p62 sequence (7Wong G. Müller O. Clark R. Conroy L. Moran M.F. Polakis P. McCormick F. Cell. 1992; 69: 551-558Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar) conjugated to keyhole limpet hemeocyanin via an amino-terminal cysteine residue. Polyclonal anti-GAP antibodies and monoclonal anti-PTyr antibody (4G10) were from UBI. For affinity precipitation of proteins with GST-SH2 domains, cells were lysed in 3T3 lysis buffer containing 1% SDS and then diluted 4-fold with lysis buffer (without SDS), and DNA was sheared by passage through a 22-gauge needle. Lysates were cleared by centrifugation in an SM24 rotor at 15,000 rpm for 20 min and precleared by incubating with GST-saturated glutathione beads. Precleared lysate (200 μg) was incubated with 10 μg of GST or GST-SH2 domain for 40 min on ice. Complexes were adsorbed to glutathione beads (20 μl) for 40 min, the beads were washed three times with 3T3 lysis buffer containing 0.1% SDS, and eluted proteins were immunoblotted and probed with anti-PTyr or anti-Sam 68 antibodies. [35S]Methionine-labeled Sam 68 was produced by in vitro transcription of pGEM-p68 h with SP6 DNA polymerase (Promega) and translation of the resulting mRNA in a rabbit reticulocyte lysate system (Promega). [35S]Methionine metabolically labeled Sam 68 was immunoprecipitated from lysates of NIH 3T3 cells, which had been labeled for 12-16 h with [35S]methionine/cysteine (ICN; ∼50 μCi/ml) in methionine-depleted medium. Immunoprecipitation or affinity precipitation of in vitro translated Sam 68 was performed in TLB (25 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 2 mM EDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% SDS, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 10 μg/ml aprotinin). Prior to immunoprecipitation, lysates were precleared by incubation with pre-immune serum and protein A-Sepharose beads. Before precipitation with GST fusion proteins, lysates were precleared by incubation with GST-saturated glutathione-Sepharose beads. Precipitations were performed by incubating lysates with antiserum (10 μl/lane) or soluble GST-fusion protein in the presence or absence of competing peptides for 45 min at 4°C, followed by incubation with protein A-Sepharose or glutathione-Sepharose beads for 30 min. Precipitates were washed 3-4 times with TLB. Precipitation with poly(U) beads (Pharmacia Biotech Inc; AGPOLY(U)) was for 10-15 min at 4°C. Poly(U) precipitates were washed 3-4 times with TLB containing 1 mg/ml heparin. Precipitates were eluted with SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis sample buffer and subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (9% acrylamide) and fluorography. To confirm precipitation of equal amounts of GST fusion proteins, gels were Coomassie Blue stained. Peptides used in these studies were synthesized by Chiron Mimotopes and were biotinylated at the amino-terminal residue. Peptides were modeled on proline-rich potential SH3-binding motifs from human Sam 68 (7Wong G. Müller O. Clark R. Conroy L. Moran M.F. Polakis P. McCormick F.

To examine the specificity with which c-Src phosphorylates and associates with Sam 68 in a physiological context, homogenates of NIH 3T3-derived c-Src overexpressor cells were incubated in the presence of EDTA to inhibit endogenous kinase activity, allowing global dephosphorylation of cellular proteins by endogenous phosphatases. Reincubation of EDTA-treated homogenates with Mg2+/ATP resulted in the tyrosine phosphorylation of two predominant proteins with molecular masses of 60 and 68 kDa, revealed by anti-PTyr immunoblotting (Fig. 1, lane 5). The 60-kDa phosphorylated protein comigrated with c-Src, which was the predominant PTyr-containing protein in untreated lysates (lanes 3 and 5). The 68-kDa phosphoprotein comigrated with tyrosine-phosphorylated Sam 68 in lysates from mitotic c-Src(RF) overexpressor cells (lanes 2 and 5). Immunoprecipitation of c-Src from detergent-solubilized homogenates demonstrated that tyrosine-phosphorylated Sam 68 co-immunoprecipitated with c-Src after ATP treatment or with c-Src(RF) from mitotic lysates (lanes 6-9). No other coprecipitating PTyr-containing proteins were detected. The identity of the coprecipitating tyrosine-phosphorylated protein as Sam 68 was confirmed by probing a duplicate blot with a commercial anti-Sam 68 antibody (data not shown). Therefore, Sam 68 appears to be the preferred substrate and binding partner of dephosphorylated, activated c-Src in total cellular homogenates, as in mitotic cells in vivo. This implies that Sam 68 possesses highly specific recognition motifs for phosphorylation by and for binding to c-Src and/or that high affinity interaction of Sam 68 phosphotyrosine residues with the c-Src SH2 domain protects Sam 68 from tyrosine dephosphorylation. To further study Sam 68-Src interactions, we generated a polyclonal antiserum against a peptide based on the Sam 68 carboxyl-terminal as predicted from the p62 cDNA sequence (see below). This antiserum immunoprecipitated a tyrosine-phosphorylated, 68-kDa protein from Src(F527)-transformed NIH 3T3 cells (Fig. 2, lane 3) and recognized an anti-PTyr and GST-SH3 domain-precipitable 68-kDa protein on Western blots (lanes 1, 3, and 6). The same antibody did not detect any proteins in Western-blotted anti-Ras GAP immunoprecipitates, although a coprecipitating 62-66-kDa protein (GAP-associated p62), as well as p190, were clearly detected with an anti-PTyr antibody (lanes 4). These results are consistent with those of Ogawa et al. (8Ogawa W. Hosomi Y. Shii K. Roth R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29602-29608Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) who concluded that Sam 68 and GAP-associated p62 are distinct proteins. However, we cannot exclude the possibility that differences in immunoreactivity, SH3 binding, electrophoretic mobility, and GAP binding in vivo are due to differential post-translational or post-transcriptional modifications of the same gene product. To analyze the specificity of binding of mitotic, tyrosine-phosphorylated Sam 68 to individual SH2 domains, lysates from unsynchronized or mitotic c-Src(RF) cells were incubated with equal amounts of the SH2 domains of c-Src, Grb2, Ras GAP (amino-terminal), and the p85α subunit of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (amino- and COOH-terminals), and the precipitated complexes were immunoblotted and probed with anti-PTyr or anti-p68 antibodies (Fig. 3). Lysates from c-Src(F527) cells were also probed to ensure that each SH2 domain was capable of binding tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins. As expected, Sam 68 was precipitated by the Src SH2 domain from mitotic but not from unsynchronized Src(RF) or Src(F527) transformed cells (lanes 7-9). Mitotic, tyrosine-phosphorylated Sam 68 also bound to other SH2 domains with apparent affinity Src ≈ Ras GAP (N) > p85α (N) > Grb 2, with little detectable binding to the p85 (C) SH2 domain (lanes 8, 11, 14, 17, and 20). The ability of mitotic, tyrosine-phosphorylated Sam 68 to bind selectively to other SH2 domains and the presence of multiple potential tyrosine phosphorylation sites in Sam 68 (7Wong G. Müller O. Clark R. Conroy L. Moran M.F. Polakis P. McCormick F. Cell. 1992; 69: 551-558Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar) suggests that other SH2 domain-containing proteins may be recruited to the Src-Sam 68 complex in mitotic cells. We have, however, been unable to detect association of Sam 68 with either Ras GAP or p85 in vivo (Fig. 2).2 2S. J. Taylor and D. Shalloway, unpublished observations. In vitro transcription and translation of the human p62 cDNA produced an [35S]methionine-labeled protein of slightly faster electrophoretic mobility than Sam 68 immunoprecipitated from [35S]methionine metabolically labeled NIH 3T3 cells (Fig. 4, lanes 1 and 3). This may reflect post-translational modification of Sam 68 in fibroblasts. Transcription and translation of the human p62 cDNA produced a protein that was specifically immunoprecipitated by anti-Sam 68 (lanes 4 and 5) and affinity precipitated by GST-Src SH3 (lane 7), confirming that Sam 68 is the product of the p62 cDNA. We have previously shown that Sam 68 is precipitated from NIH 3T3 lysates by poly(U) beads (5Taylor S.J. Shalloway D. Nature. 1994; 368: 867-871Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). To determine whether Sam 68 binds directly to poly(U), this experiment was repeated with in vitro translated Sam 68. Specific precipitation of Sam 68 with poly(U) beads was observed. This was competed by soluble poly(U) but not by poly(C) (lanes 10-12), demonstrating direct Sam 68-poly(U) interaction. Interestingly, Sam 68 was efficiently precipitated by poly(I)-poly(C) beads (Fig. 7, lane 11), suggesting that it may be able to bind to double-stranded RNA.Figure 7:SH3 domains inhibit binding of poly(U) to Sam 68. In vitro translated Sam 68 was precipitated with poly(U) beads (lanes 2-10), poly(I)-poly(C) beads (lane 11), nuclease-treated poly(U) beads (lane 12), or glutathione beads (lane 13) in the presence or absence of 10 μg (unless otherwise indicated) of the indicated GST fusion proteins. The precipitation in lane 6 was performed in the presence of 250 μM peptide 3. Lane 1 contains 20% of input translation product.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The specificity of the interaction between Sam 68 and SH3 domains was examined by affinity precipitating in vitro translated Sam 68 with different GST-SH3 domain fusion proteins (Fig. 5). Sam 68 was bound most effectively by the SH3 domains of c-Src and v-Src, but appreciable binding was also observed with the p85α SH3 domain (lanes 3-6, 14, and 16). The SH3 domains of Crk (amino-terminal), Abl, and PLCγ bound Sam 68 to lesser extents, while no binding was detectable to the SH3 domains of Fgr, spectrin, and Grb2 (COOH-terminal). Binding to the v-Src SH3 domain was abolished by point mutation of Trp-118, which is conserved in SH3 domains. Similar results were obtained by precipitating Sam 68 from NIH 3T3 lysates with different GST-SH3 domains (data not shown). To define the SH3 binding sites within Sam 68, peptides corresponding to proline-rich, potential SH3 binding sites in Sam 68 were synthesized. The ability of these peptides to inhibit Sam 68 binding to the SH3 domains of Src or p85α was assessed (Fig. 6). Peptide 3, corresponding to residues 289-306 in Sam 68, completely inhibited Sam 68 binding to Src SH3 (lane 6). The same concentrations of peptides corresponding to residues 354-365 of Sam 68 (peptide 5) and 265-280 of 3BP1 partially competed with Sam 68 for Src SH3 binding (lanes 8 and 9). In contrast, peptide 3 only partially competed for binding of Sam 68 to p85α SH3. Peptide 4 from Sam 68 and residues 89-97 of p85α also partially blocked binding (lanes 14, 15, and 18). We conclude that Src SH3 binds primarily to a region within residues 289-306 of Sam 68, while the p85α SH3 domain binds to this and at least one other site with apparently lower affinity. In similar experiments, the Ab1 SH3 domain exhibited a binding profile similar to that of the Src SH3 domain, while the Crk (N) and PLCγ SH3 binding profiles resembled that of p85α (data not shown). The results suggest that Sam 68 interacts in vivo with the Src SH3 domain in the region of residues 289-306 but that other SH3 binding sites in Sam 68 may mediate interaction with other SH3 domain-containing proteins, such as p85, and possibly other c-Src molecules. To gain insight into the functional consequences of the Src SH3-Sam 68 interaction, we examined whether Src SH3 was able to modify the RNA binding activity of Sam 68 in vitro (Fig. 7). Affinity precipitation of in vitro translated Sam 68 by poly(U) beads was blocked in a concentration-dependent manner by the Src SH3 domain (lanes 2-5). This inhibition was blocked by Sam 68 peptide 3 (lane 6), consistent with the binding data above. The ability of other SH3 domains to inhibit poly(U) binding correlated with their ability to bind to Sam 68 (lanes 7-10). Coomassie Blue staining of precipitates verified that SH3 domains did not directly bind to the poly(U) beads (data not shown), indicating that binding of SH3 domains to Sam 68 blocks its ability to bind poly(U). It will be important to determine whether SH3 domains and poly(U) compete for overlapping binding sites or whether SH3 binding causes a conformation change in Sam 68 that decreases its intrinsic poly(U) binding activity. Taken together, the results suggest that the selectivity with which Src associates with and phosphorylates Sam 68 in mitotic cells may stem from the high specificity of binding of Sam 68 sequences to the Src SH3 and SH2 domains. As a working model, we suggest that binding of Sam 68 to the Src SH3 domain may enable phosphorylation of a tyrosine residue, which then binds to c-Src SH2. Subsequent tyrosine phosphorylation of bound Sam 68 may create SH2 binding sites for other SH2-containing proteins, while those SH3 binding sites not engaged in binding to Src may recruit SH3-containing proteins to the Src-Sam 68 complex. In this way, Src-Sam 68 could direct the subcellular localization or modulate the activity of signaling proteins during the mitotic transition. This model of Sam 68 acting as a Src-elicited SH2/SH3 docking protein is consistent with recent studies by Richard et al. (32Richard S. Yu D. Blumer K.J. Hauslader D. Olszowy M.W. Connelly P.A. Shaw A.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 186-197Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) who found that tyrosine-phosphorylated Sam 68 co-immunoprecipitated with Grb2 from lysates of HeLa cells cotransfected with Sam 68, Fyn, and Grb2-encoding plasmids and with Grb2 and phospholipase Cγ from v-Src-transformed NIH 3T3 cells. The ability of Src SH3 to inhibit binding of poly(U) by Sam 68 raises the possibility that interaction of c-Src with Sam 68 modifies, either by decreasing binding ability or changing specificity, Sam 68-RNA interactions. The consequences of such modulations in mitotic cells might be to suppress processing/translation of inappropriate (e.g. G1/S-specific) messages or to prepare Sam 68 for interaction with G1-specific messages after mitosis. Since the Src SH3 domain also binds to ribonucleoprotein K (5Taylor S.J. Shalloway D. Nature. 1994; 368: 867-871Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar, 33Weng Z. Thomas S.M. Rickles R.J.

Biol. 1994; 14: 4509-4521Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar), it will be interesting to determine whether this interaction also results in a modulation of RNA binding ability. It is clear from the results presented here and elsewhere that Sam 68 is the product of the cDNA reported to encode GAP-associated p62. Antibodies raised against peptides or recombinant protein fragments derived from the reported p62 cDNA sequence specifically recognize Sam 68 (Fig. 2 and Refs. 5, 8, and 32), and transcription/translation of this clone in vitro and in vivo produces a protein with all of the characteristics of Sam 68 (Fig. 3 and Refs. 9Courtneidge S.A. Fumagalli S. Trends Cell Biol. 1994; 4: 345-347Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar and 32). However, it is also clear that Sam 68 and GAP-associated p62 differ significantly in many respects. Unlike Sam 68, GAP-associated p62 does not bind to the Src SH3 domain (Fig. 2 and Ref. 6) or to poly(U) beads (8Ogawa W. Hosomi Y. Shii K. Roth R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29602-29608Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), does not exhibit increased tyrosine phosphorylation in mitosis (Ref. 6),3 3S. J. Taylor and D. Shalloway, unpublished results. and does not react with anti-Sam 68 antibodies (including commercially available anti-p62 antibodies) (Fig. 2 and Ref. 8). Furthermore, Sam 68 does not appear to associate with GAP in vivo (Fig. 2 and Ref. 8). In light of these data and until the exact nature of GAP-associated p62 is ascertained, we suggest that Sam 68 and GAP-associated p62 be regarded as distinct proteins and be referred to accordingly We thank Paul Polakis for the human Sam 68 cDNA, Piera Cicchetti for bacteria expressing GST-Abl SH3, Stéphane Richard for communication of unpublished results, Shubha Bagrodia, Douglas Laird, and Ross Resnick for discussions, Eden Heinemann for preparation of figures, and Paula Slocum for preparation of the manuscript."

INTRODUCTIONThe phorbol esters, natural products derived from plants of the family Euphorbiaceae, have been extensively investigated in the last two decades on the basis of their potent activity as tumor promoters (1Boutwell R.K. Crit. Rev. Toxicol. 1974; 2: 419-443Crossref Scopus (686) Google Scholar, 2Blumberg P.M. Cancer Res. 1988; 48: 1-8PubMed Google Scholar). The search for the receptors for this class of compounds led to the identification of PKC as their major target (3Castagna M. Takai Y. Kaibuchi K. Sano K. Kikkawa U. Nishizuka Y. J. Biol.

The complexity and heterogeneity in the biological responses to the phorbol esters suggested the existence of multiple receptors. Indeed, protein kinase C is now recognized to represent a complex family of isozymes. The “classic” isozymes α, β, and γ and the “novel” δ ε, η, and θ all bind phorbol esters with high affinity (8Kazanietz M.G. Areces L.B. Bahador A. Mischak H. Goodnight J. Mushinski J.F.

The atypical isozymes, ζ and λ, are unable to respond to the phorbol esters (10Ono Y. Fujii T. Ogita K. Kikkawa U. Igarashi K. Nishizuka Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The members of the chimaerin family (α-1 or n-chimaerin, α-2, β-1, and β-2 chimaerin) possess a single cysteine-rich region at the N-terminal domain with high homology to those found in the PKC 1The abbreviations used are: PKCprotein kinase CPDBuphorbol 12,13-dibutyrateGSTglutathione S-transferasePCphosphatidylcholinePSphosphatidylserinePEphosphatidylethanolamineOAG1-oleoyl 2-acetyl glycerolDAGsn-1,2-diacylglycerolPCRpolymerase chain reaction. isozymes. The C-terminal domain is unrelated to PKC but has high homology with the breakpoint cluster region protein. It functions as a GTPase-activating protein for the small GTP binding protein p21 (12Hall C. Monfries C. Smith P. Lim H.H. Kozma R. Ahmed S. Vanniasingham V. Leung T. Lim L. J. Mol.

We have recently described that n-chimaerin binds phorbol esters with properties similar to PKC (16Areces L.B. Kazanietz M.G. Blumberg P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19553-19558Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Unc-13, the only identified member of the third class of phorbol ester receptors, also contains a single cysteine-rich region as well as a domain with sequence homology to the C2 domain in PKC. The cDNA for Unc-13 was isolated from a Caenorhabditiselegans library and encodes a 1734-amino acid protein. Although the function of Unc-13 is not known, a mutation in the unc-13 gene is known to cause uncoordinated movement and abnormal accumulation of acetylcholine in the nervous system of the nematode (17Maruyama I.N. Brenner S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 5729-5733Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Phorbol ester treatment of C. elegans likewise causes uncoordinated movement (18Lew K.K. Chritton S. Blumberg P.M. Teratog. Carcinog. Mutagen. 1982; 2: 19-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar).Binding of phorbol esters to PKC occurs at the cysteine-rich regions (also called zinc fingers) in the regulatory domain (19Burns D.J. Bell R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 18330-18338Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), where the motif H X12C X2C X13/14C X2C X4H X2C X7C (C, cysteine; H, histidine; X, any other amino acid) is highly conserved between PKC isozymes, chimaerins, Unc-13, diacylglycerol kinase, and the oncogenes Vav and c-Raf (20Ahmed S. Maruyama I.N. Kozma R. Lee J. Brenner S. Lim L. Biochem. J. 1992; 287: 995-999Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 21Kazanietz M.G. Bustelo X.R. Barbacid M. Kolch W. Mischak H. Wong G. Pettit G.R. Bruns J.D. Blumberg P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11590-11594Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Each cysteine-rich region coordinates two Zn2+ ions in its structure (22Quest A.F.G. Bloomenthal J. Bardes E.S.G. Bell R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 10193-10197Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). sn-1,2-diacylglycerol (DAG), a major second messenger produced through the hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate or PC, is the endogenous ligand that binds to the cysteine-rich region of PKC leading to the activation of the enzyme as well as its membrane translocation (23Ha K-S. Exton J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10534-10539Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Olivier A.R. Parker P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2758-2763Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Since phorbol esters bind to PKC in a fashion similar to DAG and similarly activate the enzyme, they have provided a powerful tool to assess the cellular roles of PKC in signal transduction. It is reasonable to assume that the non-kinase phorbol ester receptors may be also cellular targets for DAG. In this study, we analyzed the properties of the Unc-13 protein as a receptor for DAG/phorbol esters. A critical issue is that a previous report suggested that Unc-13 bound phorbol esters with an affinity much lower than that previously described for the PKC isozymes. A similar reduction in diacylglycerol affinity would render Unc-13 unresponsive to physiological concentrations of diacylglycerol. In these previous studies using a recombinant cysteine-rich region of the Unc-13 protein expressed in Escherichia coli, Ahmed and co-workers (20Ahmed S. Maruyama I.N. Kozma R. Lee J. Brenner S. Lim L. Biochem. J. 1992; 287: 995-999Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) had reported that [3H]PDBu bound with an affinity of 67 nM. In contrast, we found that PKC isozymes and n-chimaerin expressed in baculovirus, as well as recombinant cysteine-rich regions of PKC isozymes expressed in bacteria, bind [3H]PDBu with much greater affinity (0.1-1 nM). Although Unc-13 was first described as a phospholipid-independent phorbol ester receptor (17Maruyama I.N. Brenner S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 5729-5733Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar), a second report suggested that the binding of phorbol esters to the cysteine-rich region of Unc-13 required the lipid cofactor (20Ahmed S. Maruyama I.N. Kozma R. Lee J. Brenner S. Lim L. Biochem. J. 1992; 287: 995-999Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar).Given the lack of an extensive study of Unc-13 as a DAG/phorbol ester receptor, we decided to perform a detailed quantitative analysis of phorbol ester binding to the cysteine-rich region of Unc-13 and to compare it to a single cysteine-rich region of PKC (PKC δ isozyme). In contrast to previous reports, our results indicate that Unc-13 binds phorbol esters with high affinity as was also described for the PKC isozymes, although with modest differences in structure-activity relations and phospholipid requirements.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials[3H]PDBu (20.7 Ci/mmol) was purchased from DuPont NEN. [3H]Bryostatin 1 (4.8 Ci/mmol) was prepared as we previously described for [3H]bryostatin 4 (25Lewin N.E. Dell'Aquila M.L. Pettit G.R. Blumberg P.M. Warren B.S. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1992; 43: 2007-2014Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Mezerein, thymeleatoxin, (-)-octyl-indolactam V, PDBu, and 12-deoxyphorbol ester were obtained from LC Services Corp. (Woburn, MA). OAG was purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids (Pelham, AL). Phospholipids were obtained from Sigma. Calphostin C was purchased from Calbiochem. Reagents for expression and purification of recombinant proteins in E. coli were purchased from Pharmacia Biotech Inc.Expression and Purification of Recombinant Cysteine-rich Regions in E. coliFragments encoding the cysteine-rich regions of Unc-13 and PKC δ were generated by PCR. For Unc-13, a mixed stage C. elegans library (Stratagene) was amplified, and the phage cDNA was isolated using standard techniques (26Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) and used as a template for the PCR reaction. The following oligonucleotides were used: 5’-ACTCTACAAGCATGGATCTACCCGATC-3’ and 5’-CGATCTCTGATAACATTGACAAGTGA-3’, corresponding to nucleotides 1851-1877 and 2097-2122 in the sequence of Unc-13 as reported by Maruyama and Brenner (17Maruyama I.N. Brenner S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 5729-5733Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar), respectively. The second cysteine-rich region of PKC δ was generated by PCR using the full-length mouse cDNA clone (27Mischak H. Bodenteich A. Kolch W. Goodnight J. Hofer F. Mushinski J.F. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 7925-7931Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) as a template and the following oligonucleotides containing BamHI and EcoRI sites (underlined): 5’-TGAGGATCCCACCGATTCAAGGTTTATAAC-3’ and 5’-AT-CGAATTCACACAGGTTGGCCACCTTCTC-3’. The corresponding PCR fragments were subcloned into the pCRII vector using the TA cloning system (Invitrogen). An EcoRI- EcoRI insert for Unc-13 and a BamHI- EcoRI insert for PKC δ were isolated and ligated in frame in pGEX vectors (Pharmacia) to get the pGEXUnc-13 and pGEXδ plasmids, respectively. The fragments were sequenced to confirm complete homology with the published sequences. To induce the expression of the GST-fused recombinant cysteine-rich regions, E. coli XL1-blue (Stratagene) was transformed with the pGEXUnc-13 and pGEXδ plasmids, the bacteria were grown at 30°C to an A600 of 0.5-0.7 in 1 liter of LB media containing 50 μg/ml ampicillin, and the recombinant proteins were induced by the addition of 0.5 mM isopropyl-β-D-thiogalactopyranoside. After 5-6 h, the bacteria were pelleted at 4,000 × g, resuspended in 20 ml of phosphate-buffered saline, and disrupted by sonication. Purification of GST-fusion proteins was done with glutathione-Sepharose 4B according to the manufacturer's instructions (Pharmacia). The purified recombinant proteins (in 50% glycerol) were kept at −70°C. Although storage did not seem to affect the binding capacity of the PKC δ cysteine-rich region, some loss of activity was found in preparations of Unc-13 after several months at −70°C, and therefore fresh preparations were used in all cases. Binding of [3H]PDBu and [3H]Bryostatin 1-[3]PDBu binding was measured using the polyethylene glycol precipitation assay developed in our laboratory (28Sharkey N.E. Blumberg P.M. Cancer Res. 1985; 45: 19-24PubMed Google Scholar) . The assay was performed in a total volume of 250 μl, using 100 μg/ml phospholipid (100% phosphatidylserine, unless otherwise indicated), 1 mM EGTA (or 0.1 mM CaCl2 when indicated), different concentrations of [3H]PDBu, and affinity-purified GST-fusion proteins (0.4 μg/ml). Detailed descriptions for Scatchard and competition assays can be found elsewhere (8Kazanietz M.G. Areces L.B. Bahador A. Mischak H. Goodnight J. Mushinski J.F. Blumberg P.M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1993; 44: 298-307PubMed Google Scholar, 28Sharkey N.E. Blumberg P.M. Cancer Res. 1985; 45: 19-24PubMed Google Scholar) . In binding assays performed with total cellular lysates as the source of receptor, pellets from 5-ml bacterial cultures were lysed by sonication in 1 ml of lysis buffer (50 mM Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, 1 mM EGTA, 50 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 250 μg/ml leupeptin), and 50 μl of lysate/tube were used. Incubation was carried out at 18°C for 5 min. Inhibition of [3H]PDBu binding by calphostin C was done using the conditions described in Ref. 16Areces L.B. Kazanietz M.G. Blumberg P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19553-19558Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar. Phospholipid preparations were obtained by sonication, as described in Ref. 29Konig B. Di Nitto P.A. Blumberg P.M. J. Cell. Biochem. 1985; 27: 255-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar.[3H]Bryostatin 1 binding was measured by a filtration assay, using Triton X-100/phosphatidylserine-mixed micelles, in the presence of 0.1 mM EGTA, as we previously described (30Kazanietz M.G. Lewin N.E. Gao F. Pettit G.R. Blumberg P.M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 46: 374-379PubMed Google Scholar).RESULTSExpression of the Cysteine-rich Region of Unc-13 in E. coliThe GST expression system was used to express the cysteine-rich region of Unc-13 in E. coli. After isopropyl-β-D-thiogalactopyranoside induction, high levels of recombinant GST-Unc-13 were found in lysates of E. coli transformed with the pGEXUnc-13, as revealed by the appearance of a 33-kDa band in Coomassie Blue-stained polyacrylamide gels. By using glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads, the GST-Unc-13 was purified from bacterial lysates to about 90% purity. Similarly, high levels of expression were found in lysates of E. coli transformed with the pGEXδ plasmid after isopropyl-β-D-thiogalactopyranoside induction (Fig. 1 A). In contrast to the cysteine-rich region of PKC δ expressed as a GST-fusion protein, the majority of the recombinant GST-Unc-13 protein was insoluble when expressed in bacteria, and recovery after purification from the soluble fraction was comparatively lower. Overexpression of the recombinant cysteine-rich regions of Unc-13 and PKC δ resulted in high levels of [3H]PDBu binding in bacterial lysates (Fig. 1 B). Recombinant cysteine-rich regions of Unc-13, PKC isozymes, and n-chimaerin bound 65Zn (Ref. 21Kazanietz M.G. Bustelo X.R. Barbacid M. Kolch W. Mischak H. Wong G. Pettit G.R. Bruns J.D. Blumberg P.M.

J. 1992; 287: 995-999Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar).Binding of Phorbol Esters and Related Ligands to Unc-13[3H]PDBu binding to the purified cysteine-rich regions was measured. Scatchard analysis revealed that [3H]PDBu bound to Unc-13 with high affinity in the presence of phosphatidylserine (Fig. 2). The dissociation constant (Kd) for the ligand was 1.3 ± 0.2 nM (n = 3). Calcium (0.1 mM) did not affect the binding of [3H]PDBu to the receptor. Binding of [3H]PDBu to the purified recombinant cysteine-rich region of PKC δ revealed similar affinity to that obtained for Unc-13, either in the presence or absence of calcium (Table I). The Kdof [3H]PDBu for Unc-13 was substantially lower, i.e. higher binding affinity, than that first reported by Ahmed et al.(20Ahmed S. Maruyama I.N. Kozma R. Lee J. Brenner S. Lim L. Biochem. J. 1992; 287: 995-999Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The affinity of the ligand for the recombinant cysteine-rich regions was similar when the receptor was cleaved with thrombin (to separate it from the GST) and further purified by high pressure liquid chromatography (data not shown). Likewise, single cysteine-rich regions of PKC α and n-chimaerin bound [3H]PDBu with Kdvalues of 2.4 ± 0.7 nM (n = 3) and 2.0 ± 0.3 nM (n = 3), respectively, in the presence of phosphatidylserine vesicles (Ref. 31Kazanietz M.G.

The recombinant GST-fusion proteins were incubated for 5 min (18°C) with increasing concentrations of [3H]PDBu (0.25-8 nM), 100 μg/ml phosphatidylserine, and 0.1 mM EGTA, and binding was measured using the polyethylene glycol precipitation assay.

Open table in a new tab To analyze receptor-ligand interactions, we quantitated competition of [3H]PDBu binding with different classes of analogs, having different patterns of selectivity among PKC isozymes and different spectra of biological activities. The series of compounds tested, which included a 12-deoxyphorbol ester, an indole alkaloid (octylindolactam V), mezerein, a mezerein analog (thymeleatoxin), and a diacylglycerol (OAG), spanned a range of 3 orders of magnitude in binding affinity for PKC isozymes. Previous results from our laboratory revealed significant differences in structure-activity relations between PKC isozymes (8Kazanietz M.G. Areces L.B. Bahador A. Mischak H. Goodnight J. Mushinski J.F. Blumberg P.M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1993; 44: 298-307PubMed Google Scholar). Phorbol esters and 12-deoxyphorbol esters, as well as mezerein and analogs, show preference for PKC α, β, and γ compared with PKC δ, ε, and η (8Kazanietz M.G. Areces L.B. Bahador A. Mischak H. Goodnight J. Mushinski J.F. Blumberg P.M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1993; 44: 298-307PubMed Google Scholar). n-chimaerin showed a pattern of ligand preference similar to that of PKC α (16Areces L.B. Kazanietz M.G. Blumberg P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19553-19558Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In this study, we found that the binding affinities for the different compounds tested were slightly weaker (2-5 times) for Unc-13 when compared with the PKC δ cysteine-rich region (Table II). The Kifor the diacylglycerol OAG for binding to the cysteine-rich region of PKC δ was 142 nM, a value that is very similar to that obtained with PKC isozymes and n-chimaerin. Unc-13 bound OAG with slightly lower affinity (Ki= 380 nM). The mezerein analog thymeleatoxin, which is the most dramatic example of selectivity between PKC isozymes (i.e. 20-fold weaker affinity for PKC ε than PKC β, see Ref. 8Kazanietz M.G. Areces L.B. Bahador A. Mischak H. Goodnight J. Mushinski J.F. Blumberg P.M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1993; 44: 298-307PubMed Google Scholar) bound with similar affinity to both the PKC δ and Unc-13 cysteine-rich regions.Table IIStructure-activity analysis of binding to the cysteine-rich regions of Unc-13 and PKC δProtein-ligand interactions were analyzed by competition of [3H]PDBu (3 nM) binding with the individual compounds using 100 μg/ml PS and 1 mM EGTA. Six to eight increasing concentrations (in triplicate) of the competing ligand were used. The ID50 values were determined from the competition curves, and the corresponding Kivalues for the ligands were obtained (8). Values represent the mean ± S.E. of the number of experiments in parentheses. Open table in a new tab Unc-13 is also a high affinity receptor for the bryostatins, macrocyclic lactones with an atypical pattern of biological activity as compared with the typical phorbol esters. Scatchard analysis using [3H]bryostatin 1 (Fig. 3) revealed a Kdof 11.5 ± 2.0 nM for the cysteine-rich region of Unc-13 under our standard assay condition for bryostatin binding (30Kazanietz M.G. Lewin N.E. Gao F. Pettit G.R. Blumberg P.M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 46: 374-379PubMed Google Scholar). Because these assays are carried out in 0.1% Triton X-100, 20% phosphatidylserine, absolute potencies are not comparable with those determined in phosphatidylserine alone. The cysteine-rich region from PKC δ bound [3H]bryostatin 1 with about 7-fold higher affinity than that of Unc-13 (KdPKC δ = 1.7 ± 0.2 nM). Phospholipid Dependence of [3H]PDBu Binding-Reconstitution of phorbol ester binding by phospholipids depends both on the nature and concentration of the lipid cofactor (29Konig B. Di Nitto P.A. Blumberg P.M. J. Cell. Biochem. 1985; 27: 255-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Specific [3H]PDBu binding to single cysteine-rich regions of PKC was shown to be phospholipid dependent (32Quest A.F.G. Bardes E.S.G. Bell R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2953-2960Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). PS is the most efficient of the phospholipids for reconstitution of binding, although other anionic phospholipids work as lipid cofactors as well (16Areces L.B. Kazanietz M.G. Blumberg P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19553-19558Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 29Konig B. Di Nitto P.A. Blumberg P.M. J. Cell. Biochem. 1985; 27: 255-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The concentration of PS required to reconstitute [3H]PDBu binding by 50% (ED50) for the Unc-13 cysteine-rich region was 58 ± 13 μg/ml; maximum binding was obtained at about 300 μg/ml PS. The cysteine-rich region of PKC δ showed a lower ED50 for PS (15 ± 2 μg/ml) and reached saturation at about 100 μg/ml (Fig. 4). Interestingly, under the same assay conditions, the full-length n-chimaerin as well as a PKC isoform (PKC α) showed ED50 values for reconstitution by PS of 14 and 12 μg/ml, respectively (16Areces L.B.

Standard errors are represented by the errorbars.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The ability of various phospholipids to reconstitute phorbol ester binding to Unc-13 was tested. Using a fixed concentration of phospholipids (300 μg/ml), we found that all the other acidic phospholipids (phosphatidylinositol, phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate, phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate, phosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidic acid) in a proportion of 20% in PC were able to reconstitute binding to the levels obtained with PS. Interestingly, partial reconstitution (38 and 50%, respectively) was observed with the neutral phospholipids PC and 20% PE, 80% PC. In contrast to the cysteine-rich region of Unc-13, at 300 μg/ml both acidic and neutral phospholipids were able to fully reconstitute binding to the cysteine-rich region of PKC δ (Table III). Concentration-response curves with the cysteine-rich region of PKC δ gave ED50 values for reconstitution of [3H]PDBu binding of 86 ± 31 μg/ml and 111 ± 33 μg/ml for 20% PE, 80% PC and PC, respectively. Higher concentrations of neutral phospholipids were required for reconstitution of [3H]PDBu binding to Unc-13. In this latter case, the ED50 for 20% PE, 80% PC was 182 ± 32 μg/ml, and the ED50 for PC was 444 ± 62 μg/ml. For comparison, [3H]PDBu binding to full-length recombinant PKC δ (baculovirus expressed, see Ref. 8Kazanietz M.G. Areces L.B. Bahador A. Mischak H. Goodnight J. Mushinski J.F. Blumberg P.M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1993; 44: 298-307PubMed Google Scholar) was fully reconstituted by acidic phospholipids and only partially by neutral phospholipids, suggesting a different lipid requirement between the cysteine-rich region and the intact enzyme (Table III). It is possible that amino acid residues outside the cysteine-rich regions may contribute to the differences observed between the native protein and the phorbol ester binding domain, as suggested by Bell and co-workers (32Quest A.F.G. Bardes E.S.G. Bell R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2953-2960Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).

To address mechanisms of Shc activation by type I cytokine receptors, we have studied the recruitment and phosphorylation of this effector as mediated by carboxyl-terminal EPO receptor mutants.

Binding of 32P-Jak2 to GST-Shc/SH2 was assayed essentially as for GST-Grb2 and 32P-Shc (above). 32P-Labeled Jak2 was prepared by in vitro phosphorylation, eluted from washed gels, and incubated (2 h, 4 °C) with 20 μg of immobilized GST-Shc/SH2 (or 20 μg of immobilized GST). After extensive washing, bound 32P-proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography.

After washing (phosphate-buffered saline), bound proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and blotting with antibodies to Jak2.32P-Phosphoamino Acid Analyses—Shc was isolated from EPO-stimulated FDC-ER cells by immunoprecipitation and was phosphorylated in vitro. 32P-Shc was resolved by SDS-PAGE, transferred to an Immobilon membrane (Millipore), and hydrolyzed in 6 M HCl at 110 °C for 90 min. Lyophilized samples were co-electrophoresed with phosphoamino acid standards (10% acetic acid, 1% pyridine, pH 3.5) (40Cooper J.A. Sefton B.M. Hunter T. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 99: 387-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (703) Google Scholar). 32P-Phosphoamino acids were visualized by autoradiography (and standards by staining with ninhydrin).RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONPrimary studies served to establish that the EPOR as expressed stably in FDC-P1 cells (FDC-ER cells) supports induced tyrosine phosphorylation of Shc. Following exposure to EPO, Shc was immunoprecipitated from cell lysates and was assayed for tyrosine phosphorylation by Western blotting. Tyrosine phosphorylation of Shc was induced efficiently by EPO, IL-3, and GM-CSF (Fig. 1). In experiments with GM-CSF, FDC-P1 cells were used since EPOR expression (i.e. FDC-ER cells) results in a selective loss of GM-CSF responsiveness (5Quelle D.E. Wojchowski D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 4801-4805Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar).To determine whether EPO-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of Shc might be associated with its recruitment to Jak2 complexes, co-immunoprecipitation experiments next were performed. Exposure to EPO resulted in an apparent increase in levels of association of Shc with Jak2 (Fig. 2). This was observed via immunoprecipitation with antibodies to Jak2 and blotting with antibodies to Shc (Fig. 2A) or immunoprecipitation with antibodies to Shc and blotting with antibodies to Jak2 (Fig. 2B). Three forms of Jak2 consistently were resolved. These are believed to represent either differentially phosphorylated forms or potential products of limited proteolysis (6He T.-C. Jiang N. Zhuang H. Quelle D.E. Wojchowski D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18291-18294Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 38Zhuang H. Patel S.V. He T. Sonsteby S.K. Niu Z. Wojchowski D.M. J. Biol.

Due to low levels of EPO receptor expression (5Quelle D.E. Wojchowski D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 4801-4805Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 6He T.-C. Jiang N. Zhuang H. Quelle D.E. Wojchowski D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18291-18294Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), it was not possible to reproducibly detect receptors in immunoprecipitated complexes. Thus, it is considered possible that EPO-induced association of Jak2 and Shc might occur remotely from receptor complexes. However, Jak2 recently has been shown to be recruited to activated EPO receptors in 32D cells (39Miura O. Nakamura N. Quelle F.W. Witthuhn B.A. Ihle J.N. Aoki N. Blood. 1994; 84: 1501-1507Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Also, a comparison of the apparent fold stimulation of cytokine-induced Shc tyrosine phosphorylation (Fig. 1) versus induced Jak2/Shc association (Fig. 2, A and B) indicates that levels of these induced events may be somewhat disproportionate. This suggests that the association between Jak2 and Shc may not be sufficient to provide for the phosphorylation of the latter.FIG. 2EPO-, IL-3-, and GM-CSF-induced Shc association with Jak2 complexes. Following exposure of FDC-ER cells to EPO or exposure of FDC-P1 cells to IL-3 or GM-CSF, lysates were either immunoadsorbed using antibodies to Jak2 and Western-blotted with antibodies to Shc (A) or immunoadsorbed using antibodies to She and Western-blotted with antibodies to Jak2 (B). Stripped blots were reprobed with antibodies to Jak2 and Shc to confirm equivalence in loading (data not shown).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Towards identifying factors involving Shc activation, an in vitro phosphorylation assay next was developed. Briefly, this involved the immunoprecipitation of activated Jak2-Shc complexes from EPO-exposed cells and the incubation of these complexes with [γ-32P]αTP (Fig. 3A). To confirm that 32P-labeled proteins of 46 kDa and 52 kDa represent Shc, eluted proteins were assayed for specific binding to a GST-Grb2 fusion protein (Fig. 3B). Blotted 32P-Shc proteins also were hydrolyzed in HCl and analyzed by thin layer electrophoresis (Fig. 3C). Induced tyrosine phosphorylation of Shc proteins was observed, as was phosphorylation at serine and threonine residues. This indicates the presence in the immune complexes of one or more serine/threonine kinase(s) in addition to Jak2. Notably, the observed in vitro phosphorylation of Shc was EPO-dependent, and, using this system, IL-3- and GM-CSF-dependent phosphorylation of p46Shc and p52Shc also was observed (Fig. 4).FIG. 3Development of an in vitro assay for EPO-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of Shc. A, following exposure of FDC-ER cells to EPO, She proteins were immunoprecipitated from Brij-96 lysates and assayed for phosphorylation in vitro using [γ-32P]αTP, SDS-PAGE, and autoradiography. Panel B, to confirm the identity of immunoprecipitated, 32P-phosphorylated Mr = 46,000 and Mr = 52,000 proteins as She, phosphorylated products were eluted from antibody/Protein A-Sepharose gels and were assayed for specific binding to immobilized GST-Grb2 versus GST. Panel C, to test whether in vitro phosphorylation of Shc was at tyrosine residues, 32P-Shc from in vitro kinase assays was blotted to Immobilon membranes, excised, and hydrolyzed in 6.0 m HCl and co-electrophoresed with phosphoamino acid standards.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)FIG. 4IL-3-, GM-CSF-, and EPO-dependent phosphorylation of Shc in vitro.

Chem. 1994; 269: 15337-15343Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the possibility that EPO-induced recruitment of Shc to Jak2 complexes might depend upon phosphotyrosine sites within the EPO receptor was tested using select carboxyl-terminal truncation mutants (Fig. 5A). EPOR329 (FDC-ER329 cells) is a mutant which efficiently mediates Jak2 kinase activation but is deficient in mitogenesis (6He T.-C. Jiang N. Zhuang H. Quelle D.E. Wojchowski D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18291-18294Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and notably encodes no cytoplasmic tyrosine residues. EPOR256 (FDC-ER256 cells) constitutes a control construct, encodes only eight cytoplasmic residues, and is inactive in both Jak2 activation and mitogenesis. When assayed for the ability to mediate Shc phosphorylation, mutant EPOR329 supported this EPO-dependent event at levels comparable to wt receptor (Fig. 5B). In contrast, no induced phosphorylation of Shc was detectable for EPOR256. Assuming that EPO-induced recruitment of Shc occurs via its SH2 domain, these experiments suggest that recruitment does not depend upon phosphorylated EPO receptor sites, but rather can proceed efficiently via an accessory phosphoprotein. To further test this finding, the ability of EPOR329 to recruit Shc following EPO exposure also was assessed via immunoprecipitation of complexes with antibodies to either Jak2 or Shc and direct blotting with antibodies to Shc or Jak2 with comparable positive results obtained by each method (Fig. 6A). Furthermore, EPO-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of Shc by this truncated receptor form in intact FDC-ER329 cells was observed via precipitation with Shc antibodies and direct blotting with antibodies to phosphotyrosine (Fig. 6B).FIG. 5EPO-induced phosphorylation of Shc via a carboxyl-terminal-truncated receptor form (ER329) lacking cytoplasmic tyrosine residues.

Direct and selective binding of Jak2 to immobilized GST-Shc/SH2 was observed by Western blotting of eluted proteins (Fig. 7A), and this was shown to depend upon pre-exposure of FDC-ER cells to EPO (Fig. 7B). Finally, this GST-Shc/SH2 fusion protein also specifically and directly bound 32P-Jak2 as isolated following immunoadsorption from FDC-ER cells, in vitro autophosphorylation, extensive washing, and SDS elution (Fig. 7C).FIG. 7SH2 domain-dependent association of Shc with Jak2.

https://openalex.org/W2027980005,"The major platelet integrin αIIbβ3 (glycoprotein IIb-IIIa) has been implicated in the regulation of tyrosine phosphorylation and dephosphorylation in activated platelets. To investigate the mechanisms of the αIIbβ3-dependent tyrosine dephosphorylation, normal platelets or thrombasthenic platelets lacking αIIbβ3 were stimulated with thrombin and fractionated into Triton X-100-soluble or -insoluble subcellular matrices. We then examined the kinetics of the tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins and distribution of protein-tyrosine phosphatases in these fractions and whole cell lysates. First, αIIbβ3-dependent tyrosine dephosphorylation was recovered mainly in the cytoskeleton with similar kinetics to the whole cell lysate. Second, protein-tyrosine phosphatase (PTP) 1B and its cleaved 42-kDa form were associated with the cytoskeleton in an aggregation-dependent manner, whereas association of PTP1C with the cytoskeleton was regulated differentially both by thrombin stimulation and by αIIbβ3-mediated aggregation. Several calpain inhibitors did not affect either tyrosine phosphorylation and dephosphorylation or relocation of PTP1B, but they did inhibit cleavage of PTP1B. Cytochalasin D blocked relocation of both PTP1B and PTP1C but not PTP1B cleavage. SH-PTP2 was distributed in the other fractions than the cytoskeleton and showed no relocation on thrombin stimulation. Finally, the cytoskeleton-associated PTP1C became tyrosine-phosphorylated in an αIIbβ3-mediated aggregation-dependent manner.

INTRODUCTIONPlatelets are nonproliferative, terminally differentiated cells, which offer an attractive model system to study the various biochemical events leading to structural and functional alterations in activated cells. When platelets are exposed to stimuli such as thrombin and collagen, platelets become activated, undergo a dramatic shape change, adhere to each other, and aggregate. In these processes, the major platelet integrin αIIbβ3 (also called glycoprotein IIb-IIIa), which is a heterodimeric adhesion receptor (1Hynes R.O. Cell. 1992; 69: 11-25Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (8966) Google Scholar), plays a critical role. Integrin αIIbβ3 can recognize Arg-Gly-Asp-containing adhesive ligands including fibrinogen, fibronectin, von Willebrand factor, and vitronectin (2Kieffer N. Phillips D.R. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1990; 6: 329-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar, 3Plow E.F. Ginsberg M.H. Prog. Hemostasis Thromb. 1989; 9: 117-156PubMed Google Scholar). Among these adhesive molecules, the binding of fibrinogen to αIIbβ3 is the major mechanism for platelet aggregation. Besides functioning as an adhesive receptor, integrin αIIbβ3 is involved in signal transduction from the extracellular matrix to the cytoplasm (4Juliano R.L. Haskill S. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 577-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (1527) Google Scholar).Protein-tyrosine phosphorylation has been implicated in most biochemical events that involve transmembrane signaling and cytoskeletal reorganization. Agonist-stimulated platelets show rapid changes in tyrosine phosphorylation of multiple proteins (5Ferrell J.E. Martin G.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 3603-3610Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 6Golden A. Brugge J.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 901-905Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar), some of which are dependent on platelet aggregation mediated through the binding of immobilized fibrinogen to αIIbβ3 under stirring condition (7Ferrell Jr., J.E.

Like the PTK family, PTPases are grouped into two forms: non-transmembrane cytoplasmic PTPases and receptor-type transmembrane PTPases (17Fischer Jr., E.H. Charbonneau H. Tonks N.K. Science. 1991; 253: 401-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (863) Google Scholar). Non-transmembrane PTPases consist of a single catalytic domain and N- or C-terminal extensions, which are important for enzymatic regulation and intracellular localization.

J. Immunol. 1988; 140: 1861-1867PubMed Google Scholar).We previously reported that αIIbβ3 is involved in the tyrosine-specific dephosphorylation of certain proteins, suggesting for the first time the engagement of αIIbβ3 in the activation of some PTPases present in platelets (33Takayama H. Ezumi Y. Ichinohe T. Okuma M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 194: 472-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Here we report that cytoskeletal reorganization and protein-tyrosine phosphorylation are also involved in the αIIbβ3-dependent regulation of PTPases in platelets.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterialsAnti-phosphotyrosine monoclonal antibodies 4G10 and PY20 were purchased from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. (UBI, Lake Placid, NY) and ICN Biomedicals, Inc. (Costa Mesa, CA), respectively. Affinity-purified rabbit polyclonal antibodies against PTP1B, PTP1C, and SH-PTP2 were from UBI. Monoclonal antibody 327 is specific for pp60c-src and was obtained from Oncogene Science, Inc. (Uniondale, NY). Prostaglandin E1 was kindly provided by Ono Pharmaceutical Co. (Osaka, Japan). Cytochalasin D and aprotinin were obtained from Sigma. Leupeptin was from Peptide Institute, Inc. (Minoh, Japan). Calpeptin was from LC Laboratories (Woburn, MA). EST and MDL were generous gifts of Dr. M. Tamai of Taisho Pharmaceutical Co. (Saitama, Japan) and Dr. E. H. W. Bohme of Marion Merrell Dow Research Institute (Cincinnati, OH), respectively. All other reagents were obtained as described previously (33Takayama H. Ezumi Y. Ichinohe T. Okuma M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 194: 472-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar).Preparation and Activation of PlateletsAfter informed consent was obtained, venous blood was collected from healthy adult donors or from patients with Glanzmann's thrombasthenia. Anti-coagulation of blood and preparation of washed platelets were performed as described previously (33Takayama H. Ezumi Y. Ichinohe T. Okuma M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 194: 472-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Washed platelets (0.5-1.0 × 109 cells/ml) were activated by 1 unit/ml thrombin with or without stirring at 1,000 rpm in an aggregometer at 37°C for appropriate intervals. In some experiments, washed platelets were preincubated for 10 min at 37°C with the following inhibitors prior to activation with thrombin: 1 mM RGDS, 20 μM cytochalasin D, 500 μM EST, 250 μM calpeptin, or 250 μM MDL.Fractionation of PlateletsSubcellular fractionation of platelets was carried out using a modification of the method described by Fox et al.(34Fox J.E.B. Lipfert L. Clark E.A. Reynolds C.C. Austin C.D. Brugge J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25973-25984Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). After washed platelets (5 × 108 cells/ml) were activated with thrombin, reactions were stopped by lysing the cells with 0.5 volume of 3 × lysis buffer containing 3% Triton X-100, 15 mM EGTA, 15 mM EDTA, 30 mM benzamidine, 3 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), 3 mM Na3VO4, 60 μg/ml leupeptin, 60 μg/ml aprotinin, 30 μM cytochalasin D, and 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4. In some experiments, cytochalasin D was omitted from the lysis buffer. This and all subsequent steps were performed at 4°C. The cytoskeleton was sedimented immediately by centrifugation of the lysate at 10,000 × g for 5 min. The membrane skeleton was isolated from the 10,000 × g supernatant by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 3 h in a 1.5-ml microcentrifuge tube (Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany) with a Beckman TL-100 using a TLA-100.3 rotor (Beckman Instruments, Inc., Palo Alto, CA). The cytoskeleton and the membrane skeleton then were washed three times with 1 × lysis buffer containing 1% Triton X-100, 5 mM EGTA, 5 mM EDTA, 10 mM benzamidine, 1 mM PMSF, 1 mM Na3VO4, 20 μg/ml leupeptin, 20 μg/ml aprotinin, and 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, and solubilized in 1 × SDS sample buffer (2% SDS, 5% glycerol, 5%β-mercaptoethanol, 62.5 mM Tris-HCl, pH 6.8). The Triton X-100-soluble fraction from the 100,000 × g supernatant was diluted with 0.5 volume of 3 × concentrated SDS sample buffer. When the samples of the whole lysate of platelets were needed, thrombin-activated platelets were solubilized directly by addition of 0.5 volume of 3 × concentrated SDS sample buffer. Following solubilization in SDS sample buffer, the samples were promptly boiled for 5 min.ImmunoblottingThe samples (proteins from 1 × 107 platelets/lane) were subjected to 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) (35Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206024) Google Scholar). Separated proteins were transferred electrophoretically to a nitrocellulose membrane (Bio-Rad) with a semidry blotter. The membranes were blocked for 1 h at room temperature or overnight at 4°C with 3% nonfat dried milk in TPBS (0.1% Tween 20, 137 mM NaCl, 2.7 mM KCl, 8 mM Na2HPO4, 1.5 mM KH2PO4) and washed three times in TPBS. The membranes then were incubated for 2 h with primary antibodies against proteins of interest in TPBS containing 1% bovine serum albumin. The primary antibodies used were as follows: a mixture of anti-phosphotyrosine monoclonal antibodies 4G10 and PY20 (1 μg/ml each); anti-pp60c-src monoclonal antibody 327 (1 μg/ml); polyclonal antibodies against PTP1B (0.5 μg/ml), PTP1C (1 μg/ml), or SH-PTP2 (1 μg/ml). The membranes were washed four times in TPBS and incubated for 1 h either with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse (1 μg/ml) or anti-rabbit (0.5 μg/ml) IgG in TPBS containing 1% bovine serum albumin. Immunoreactivity was determined using the ECL chemiluminescence reaction (Amersham International plc, Little Chalfont, United Kingdom). In some experiments, the membranes once probed were stripped of bound antibodies by incubation in buffer containing 100 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, 2% SDS, 62.5 mM Tris-HCl, pH 6.7, for 30 min at 60°C and then reprobed with other antibodies as described above.ImmunoprecipitationWashed platelets (1 × 109 cells/ml) were stimulated with thrombin for appropriate periods and lysed for 1 h in 0.5 volume of 3 × radioimmunoprecipitation assay (RIPA) buffer (150 mM NaCl, 15 mM EGTA, 3% Triton X-100, 3% sodium deoxycholate, 0.3% SDS, 3 mM PMSF, 3 mM Na3VO4, 60 μg/ml leupeptin, 60 μg/ml aprotinin, and 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4). This and all subsequent steps were carried out at 4°C. The lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 16,000 × g for 20 min, precleared with 50 μl of protein A-Sepharose CL-4B (50% slurry) (Pharmacia LKB Biotechnology, Inc., Uppsala, Sweden) by sedimentation at 16,000 × g for 3 min, and then incubated for 2 h with anti-PTP1B antibody (2 μg/ml), anti-PTP1C antibody (4 μg/ml), anti-SH-PTP2 antibody (10 μg/ml), or rabbit anti-mouse IgG (10 μg/ml) as a control. Immune complexes were incubated for 1 h with 50 μl of protein A-Sepharose CL-4B (50% slurry). Immunoprecipitates were sedimented by brief centrifugation and washed four times in 1 × RIPA buffer (150 mM NaCl, 5 mM EGTA, 1% Triton X-100, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 1 mM PMSF, 1 mM Na3VO4, 20 μg/ml leupeptin, 20 μg/ml aprotinin, and 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4). For immunoprecipitation of proteins from the subcellular fractions, the cytoskeleton and the membrane skeleton of thrombin-activated platelets were solubilized in RIPA buffer following fractionation of cells. Immunoprecipitated PTP1C was obtained from each solubilized fraction in RIPA buffer. Immunoprecipitated proteins (from 4 × 108 platelets/lane) were eluted from protein A-Sepharose beads in 1 × SDS sample buffer, boiled for 5 min, resolved on SDS-PAGE, and analyzed by immunoblotting as described above.RESULTSProtein-tyrosine Phosphorylation and Dephosphorylation in the Subcellular Fractions of Thrombin-activated PlateletsTo investigate the involvement of integrin αIIbβ3 in protein-tyrosine phosphorylation and dephosphorylation, we first examined tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins by immunoblot assay in whole lysates of platelets from normal donors and from patients with Glanzmann's thrombasthenia. As shown in Fig. 1(A and B), thrombasthenic platelets lacking αIIbβ3 showed different patterns from normal platelets in tyrosine dephosphorylation as well as in tyrosine phosphorylation on stimulation with thrombin. In normal platelets, tyrosine-phosphorylated protein bands with molecular masses of 130, 120, and 115 kDa peaked at 10 s, 30 s, and 2 min, respectively, then quickly declined, and disappeared. However, in thrombasthenic platelets, the 130- and 120-kDa protein bands persisted and were not dephosphorylated until 5 min after stimulation, whereas the 115-kDa protein band did not appear. Two clusters of protein bands with molecular masses of 68-78 and 53-60 kDa also showed tyrosine-specific dephosphorylation in normal platelets but did not in thrombasthenic platelets. Immunoblot analysis with anti-pp60c-src antibody revealed that the most prominent band in the 53-60-kDa bundle was pp60c-src (data not shown). The 102-kDa tyrosine-phosphorylated protein band appeared at 2 min and persisted until 5 min following thrombin stimulation in normal platelets, but did not appear in thrombasthenic platelets. The 95-kDa band peaked at 30 s and was persistent until 5 min either in normal or thrombasthenic platelets. These results indicated that αIIbβ3 was involved in the tyrosine phosphorylation of the 115- and 102-kDa protein bands and the tyrosine dephosphorylation of the 130-, 120-, 68-78-, and 53-60-kDa protein bands. Thrombasthenic platelets also differed from normal platelets in kinetic patterns of other doublet bands of 36/37 and 33/34 kDa in tyrosine phosphorylation and dephosphorylation. Following stimulation with thrombin, these doublets peaked at 10 s, quickly declined, and disappeared in normal platelets, whereas these bands in thrombasthenic platelets peaked at 30 s and declined slowly.Because previous reports have suggested that many tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins are components of Triton X-100-insoluble, cytoskeleton-rich fractions of activated platelets, we explored whether the Triton X-100-soluble or -insoluble subcellular fraction was the site of the tyrosine dephosphorylation observed in the whole lysate of thrombin-activated platelets. This investigation led us to the finding that the conventionally used lysis buffer (34Fox J.E.B. Lipfert L. Clark E.A. Reynolds C.C. Austin C.D. Brugge J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25973-25984Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) should be modified by including cytochalasin D to observe the protein-tyrosine dephosphorylation patterns in the subcellular fractions with similar kinetics to those in the whole cell lysate. When we used the lysis buffer without cytochalasin D, protein-tyrosine phosphorylation observed in the cytoskeleton of normal platelets was persistent and quite different from that in the whole cell lysate (Fig. 1C ’, parentheses). On the contrary, using the modified lysis buffer containing cytochalasin D as described under “Experimental Procedures,” nearly identical patterns of tyrosine phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of proteins observed in the whole cell lysate were noted in the cytoskeletons of normal and thrombasthenic platelets (Fig. 1, C-H), except for several protein bands. One exception to these observations was pp60c-src. pp60c-src was redistributed from the Triton X-100-soluble fraction and the Triton X-100-insoluble membrane skeleton into the cytoskeleton in aggregated normal platelets but not in thrombasthenic platelets, as has been reported by several laboratories (14Clark E.A.

Other exceptions were the 36/37- and 33/34-kDa tyrosine-phosphorylated protein bands. We could not obtain reproducible results for the cytoskeletal localization of these protein bands. However, we detected only the 36/37-kDa bands in the cytoskeleton of normal platelets. When normal platelets were activated with thrombin in the presence of RGDS, an inhibitor of αIIbβ3-fibrinogen binding, or without stirring to prevent platelet aggregation, we obtained the same patterns of tyrosine phosphorylation and dephosphorylation as observed in thrombasthenic platelets (data not shown).Cytochalasin D but Not Calpain Inhibitors Affects the Patterns of Tyrosine PhosphorylationNext, we examined whether an inhibitor of actin polymerization, cytochalasin D, influenced the state of tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins in the whole cell lysate and in the cytoskeleton. As shown in Fig. 2, pretreatment of normal platelets with 20 μM cytochalasin D did not inhibit thrombin-induced aggregation (data not shown), but markedly reduced the thrombin-induced tyrosine-phosphorylated protein bands both in the whole cell lysate and in the cytoskeleton. This suggested that tyrosine phosphorylation of the cytoskeletal components was largely dependent on actin polymerization. Furthermore, cytochalasin D blocked the relocation of pp60c-src to the cytoskeleton in aggregated normal platelets (Fig. 2, C, E, and G), confirming the findings by Oda et al.(16Oda A. Druker B.J. Smith M. Salzman E.W. J. Biol.

Washed platelets from normal donors were pretreated with 20 μM cytochalasin D (A, C, E, and G) or 500 μM EST (B, D, F, and H) for 10 min and stimulated with 1 unit/ml thrombin for the indicated times under stirring conditions. The platelets were lysed directly in SDS sample buffer to obtain whole cell lysates (A and B) or in 1% Triton X-100-containing lysis buffer with cytochalasin D, and fractionated into the cytoskeleton (C and D), the membrane skeleton (E and F), and the 1% Triton X-100-soluble fraction (G and H) as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Proteins from the same number of platelets were subjected to 10% SDS-PAGE and probed by immunoblotting with anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies.

Hence we studied the effects of calpain inhibitors EST (36Tamai M. Matsumoto K. Omura S. Koyama I. Ozawa Y. Hanada K. J. Pharmacobiol.

However, as shown in Fig. 2, EST affected neither aggregation (data not shown) nor the patterns of tyrosine phosphorylation and dephosphorylation in the whole cell lysate and the subcellular fractions, particularly the cytoskeleton. At the same time, we confirmed that the cleavage of PTP1B occurred in thrombin-activated normal platelets as aggregation proceeded but not in thrombin-activated thrombasthenic platelets which showed no aggregation; EST completely inhibited this aggregation-dependent cleavage of PTP1B (Fig. 3, a, b, and d). The other calpain inhibitors, MDL and calpeptin, did not affect either aggregation or tyrosine phosphorylation and dephosphorylation. However, calpeptin inhibited the cleavage of PTP1B less than EST or MDL (data not shown). By contrast, cytochalasin D did not prevent cleavage of PTP1B (Fig. 3c).Figure 3:Aggregation-dependent cleavage of PTP1B in thrombin-activated platelets is inhibited completely by EST but not by cytochalasin D. Untreated normal (a) or thrombasthenic platelets (b) were stimulated with 1 unit/ml thrombin for the indicated times under stirring conditions. Normal platelets pretreated with 20 μM cytochalasin D (c) or 500 μM EST (d) were stimulated with thrombin. Platelets were lysed in SDS sample buffer. Proteins from the same number of platelets were subjected to 10% SDS-PAGE and probed by immunoblotting with anti-PTP1B antibody.

As shown in Fig. 4A, PTP1B translocated from the detergent-soluble fraction to the cytoskeleton in thrombin-activated normal platelets under stirring conditions. Interestingly, not only PTP1B itself but also its cleaved 42-kDa form were associated with the cytoskeleton in a time-dependent manner as platelets aggregated (Fig. 4A, a). In thrombasthenic platelets stimulated with thrombin, PTP1B did not translocate to the cytoskeleton (Fig. 4B, a). We confirmed that PTP1B did not translocate to the cytoskeleton if normal platelets were activated with thrombin in the presence of RGDS or under unstirring conditions to prevent aggregation (data not shown).

This antiserum precipitated a 140-kDa protein from metabolically 35S-labeled NIH3T3 cells. Using this antiserum, we showed that endogenous RPTPα is constitutively phosphorylated in NIH3T3 cells, predominantly on two serines, which we identified as Ser-180 and Ser-204, lying in the juxtamembrane domain. 12- O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) stimulation of quiescent NIH3T3 cells rapidly increased phosphorylation of Ser-180 and Ser-204.

When wild type and S180A/S204A double mutant RPTPαs were transiently expressed in 293 human embryonic kidney cells, TPA stimulated phosphorylation of wild type but not of double mutant RPTPα. PKC down-regulation following prolonged exposure to TPA diminished TPA-stimulated RPTPα phosphorylation. Taken together, these results indicate that RPTPα is a direct substrate for (PKC). Examination of 293 cells expressing exogenous RPTPα using immunofluorescence confocal microscopy showed that RPTPα exists predominantly in two subcellular compartments: in dense intracellular granules or dispersed within the plasma membrane. TPA treatment caused redistribution of some intracellular RPTPα to the cell surface, but this did not require direct phosphorylation of RPTPα at Ser-180/Ser-204.

Signal transduction by protein-tyrosine kinases is relatively well understood, but rather little is known about their enzymatic counterpart, the protein-tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs).1( 1The abbreviations used are: PTPprotein-tyrosine phosphataseTPA12- O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetatePKCprotein kinase CDMEMDulbecco's modified Eagle's mediumPBSphosphate-buffered salineDTTdithiothreitolRPTPreceptor-like protein-tyrosine phosphataseMAPmitogen-activated proteinEGFepidermal growth factorGSTglutathione S-transferasebPTPαbacterial protein-tyrosine phosphatase αCScalf serum. ) Over the past few years, a large number of PTPs have been cloned, based on sequence homology within the catalytic domains (for reviews, see Refs. 1Fischer E.H.

Most but not all receptor-like PTPs (RPTPs) contain two cytoplasmic catalytic PTP domains. The domain closest to the membrane exhibits the majority of the PTP activity, but in some cases the second domain also possesses detectable but low PTP activity (5Wang Y. Pallen C.J.

RPTP extracellular domains range in size from over 1600 to 27 residues.

A. 1990; 87: 6112-6116Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar)) is a RPTP, with a rather short extracellular domain lacking any obvious structural motifs or cysteines (1Fischer E.H.

Mammalian RPTPα contains 793 amino acids, including a 19-residue signal sequence, a 123-amino acid extracellular domain, a transmembrane domain, two catalytic domains, and a short C-terminal tail. Both catalytic domains have been shown to have in vitro PTP activity when expressed individually in bacteria (5Wang Y. Pallen C.J. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 3231-3237Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) or collectively when expressed in insect cells (12Daum G. Zander N.F. Morse B. Hurwitz D. Schlessinger J. Fischer E.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 12211-12215Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). RPTPα is most highly expressed in brain, both in embryonic development and in the adult (11Sap J. D'Eustachio P. Givol D. Schlessinger J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 6112-6116Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). The fact that RPTPα mRNA expression is enhanced during differentiation of neuronally derived cell lines suggests that RPTPα may be involved in neuronal differentiation. This idea is reinforced by the finding that overexpression of RPTPα in pluripotent P19 embryonal carcinoma cells alters the differentiation fate of these cells in favor of neuronal differentiation (13den Hertog J. Pals C.E.G.M. Peppelenbosch M.P. Tertoolen L.G.J. de Laat S.W. Kruijer W. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3789-3798Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). The nonreceptor protein-tyrosine kinase c-Src is activated in the RPTPα-overexpressing P19 cells (13den Hertog J. Pals C.E.G.M. Peppelenbosch M.P. Tertoolen L.G.J. de Laat S.W. Kruijer W. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3789-3798Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar) and in RPTPα-overexpressing Rat-2 cells (14Zheng X.M. Wang Y. Pallen C.J. Nature. 1992; 359: 336-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar), possibly as a result of direct dephosphorylation of the c-Src inhibitory tyrosine phosphorylation site (Tyr-527) by RPTPα. Relatively little is known about regulation of PTP activity, but there are indications that both serine and tyrosine phosphorylation may play an important role. Treatment of T cells with the calcium ionophore ionomycin leads to a decrease in CD45 activity concomitant with a decrease in CD45 serine phosphorylation (15Ostergaard H.L. Trowbridge I.S. Science. 1991; 253: 1423-1425Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Serine phosphorylation of CD45 and of the cytoplasmically localized PTP1B is enhanced in response to phorbol ester treatment (16Yamada A. Streuli M. Saito H. Rothstein D.M. Schlossman S.F. Morimoto C. Eur. J. Immunol. 1990; 20: 1655-1660Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 17Flint A.J. Gebbink M.F.G.B. Franza Jr., B.R. Hill D.E. Tonks N.K. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 1937-1946Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). However, these phosphorylation events do not significantly affect the activity of either PTP. In contrast, phorbol ester treatment of HL-60 cells has been found to increase the expression, activity and serine phosphorylation of PTP1C and its translocation to the plasma membrane (18Zhao Z. Shen A.-H. Fischer E.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 5007-5011Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), but it is not clear that this phosphorylation is directly due to PKC nor whether it affects PTP1C activity indirectly. TPA treatment also leads to a small increase in RPTPα activity, concomitant with an increase in serine phosphorylation, and in this case phosphorylation has been shown to decrease the Kmfor phosphopeptide substrate (19den Hertog J. Sap J. Pals C.E.G.M. Schlessinger J. Kruijer W. Cell Growth & Differ. 1995; 6: 303-307PubMed Google Scholar). PTP-PEST is phosphorylated in vitro and in vivo by PKC, but in this case its activity is decreased due to an increase in its Kmfor substrate (20Garton A.J. Tonks N.K. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3763-3771Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). It has been shown that MAP kinase phosphorylates and inactivates PTP2C (also known as PTP1D, Syp, and SH-PTP2) in vitro, and this phosphorylation may be responsible for the inhibition of PTP2C observed in EGF-treated PC12 cells during the time when MAP kinase is activated (21Peraldi P. Zhao Z. Filloux C. Fischer E.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 5002-5006Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). There are also a number of reports of tyrosine phosphorylation of PTPs. The SH2-containing nonreceptor PTP, PTP1D, is phosphorylated on tyrosine in response to activation of the EGF and platelet-derived growth factor receptor-like protein-tyrosine kinases (22Feng G.S. Hui C.C. Pawson T. Science. 1993; 259: 1607-1611Crossref PubMed Scopus (589) Google Scholar, 23Vogel W. Lammers R. Huang J. Ullrich A. Science. 1993; 259: 1611-1614Crossref PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar), but whether tyrosine phosphorylation affects PTP1D activity remains to be established definitively. CSF-1 treatment of mouse macrophages induces tyrosine phosphorylation of the related SH2-containing PTP, PTP1C (24Yeung Y.-G. Berg K.L. Pixley F.J. Angeletti R.H. Stanley E.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23447-23450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We have found that RPTPα is constitutively phosphorylated on Tyr-789 in fibroblasts, and that protein Tyr-789 acts as a binding site for the adaptor protein Grb2 (25den Hertog J. Tracy S. Hunter T. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3020-3032Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Su et al.(26Su J. Batzer A. Sap J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18731-18734Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) have also shown that RPTPα is tyrosine phosphorylated and associates with Grb2. RPTP CD45 is phosphorylated on tyrosine in vivo following treatment of cells with the PTP inhibitor phenylarsene oxide (27Stover D.R. Charbonneau H. Tonks N.K. Walsh K.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 7704-7707Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), but whether treatment affects activity in vivo is unclear. The same group has recently reported that the PTP activity of RPTP CD45 is increased in vitro by sequential phosphorylation first by a protein-tyrosine kinase and second by a protein-serine kinase (28Stover D.R. Walsh K.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5523-5532Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The order of phosphorylation is critical, and the increase in activity is also specific for the RCML substrate. Proteolytic removal of the first catalytic domain produces a similar activation (6Tan X. Stover D.R. Walsh K.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 6835-6838Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), implying that the increase in RCML-specific PTP activity is due to the second catalytic domain, consistent with the sites of phosphorylation being located within the N-terminal portion of the second catalytic domain. To begin to characterize RPTPα function, we asked whether it is phosphorylated in vivo and whether its phosphorylation can be modulated in response to growth factors. We have shown that RPTPα is constitutively phosphorylated predominantly on serine and have located the two serine residues close to the inner face of the plasma membrane as major sites of phosphorylation. Phorbol ester treatment increases phosphorylation at these sites, and purified PKC phosphorylates these same serines in vitro. Sequences for the PTPs PTP1B (29Charbonneau H. Tonks N.K. Kumar S.

These sequences were aligned, and regions conserved in the three PTPs were used to design oligonucleotide primers specific for the catalytic domain. polymerase chain reactions were performed using RNA from NIH3T3 cells as a template. The product of this reaction was used to probe an NIH3T3 cDNA library. A clone encoding a protein with a structure typical of a CD45-like phosphatase was isolated. This clone, pPTPα, was used in all subsequent experiments. The sequence and predicted translation product of pPTPα are essentially identical to other reported mouse RPTPα clones (9Matthews R.J. Cahir E.D. Thomas M.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 4444-4448Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 11Sap J. D'Eustachio P. Givol D. Schlessinger J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Recombinant PTPα was generated by fusing the cytoplasmic domain of PTPα beginning at Phe-168 to the glutathione S-transferase gene of the expression plasmid pGEXKG (pGEXPTPα). The fusion protein was purified on glutathione-Sepharose beads and cleaved with thrombin generating bPTPα. For 32P labeling, NIH3T3 cells were grown to ~75% confluence in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) containing 10% calf serum (CS) and then shifted to DMEM containing 0.5% CS. After 24 h, the cells were labeled in phosphate-free DMEM containing 0.5% dialyzed CS and 2 mCi/ml [32P]orthophosphate (ICN) for 16 h at 37°C. Cells were stimulated by the addition of 50 ng/ml TPA (Sigma) for 15 min at 37°C. For 35S labeling, ~2 Ꭓ105 NIH3T3 cells grown under the same conditions were labeled with 100 μCi/ml [35S]methionine/cysteine (Express, DuPont NEN) for 20 h at 37°C in methionine-free DMEM containing 4% dialyzed CS. For transfection experiments, human embryonic kidney 293 cells were seeded on plates coated with 0.1% gelatin in DMEM containing 10% calf serum. 24 h later, cells were transfected with 20 μg of Sg5 vector, which utilizes a SV40 promoter to drive expression, containing either full-length wild type (13den Hertog J.

Transfections were done using the calcium phosphate method as previously described (25den Hertog J. Tracy S. Hunter T. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3020-3032Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). 8 h after transfection, the medium was changed to either methionine-free DMEM containing 1% dialyzed CS or phosphate-free DMEM containing 1% dialyzed CS and incubated an additional 16 h at 37°C. Cells were stimulated by the addition of 100 ng/ml TPA for 10 min at 37°C (initial time course experiments had shown that the shorter time was optimal for the transfected cells). Polyclonal rabbit antiserum, 5201, was raised against the peptide CYKVVQEYIDAFSDYANFK corresponding to the C-terminal 19 residues of RPTPα. The peptide was coupled to KLH (Calbiochem) and used to immunize rabbits (32Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 18.8-18.9Google Scholar). Polyclonal rabbit antiserum, 5478, was raised against purified bPTPα protein and purified on a GST-bPTPα affinity column (25den Hertog J. Tracy S. Hunter T. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3020-3032Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). 35S- or 32P-labeled cells were lysed in SDS-boiling lysis buffer (10 mM sodium phosphate, pH 7.2, 0.5% SDS, 1% aprotinin, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM dithiothreitol (DTT)), boiled, and diluted with 4 volumes of RIPA buffer (10 mM sodium phosphate, pH 7.0, 150 mM NaCl, 2 mM EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS) containing 1 mM DTT but lacking SDS. Lysates were prepared and proteins were immunoprecipitated with 8 μl of preimmune serum, 8 μl of immune serum, or 8 μl of immune serum preincubated with 10 μg of immunizing peptide. The immunoprecipitates were collected on protein A-Sepharose and washed four times in RIPA buffer without DTT. The labeled proteins were resolved on a 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and transferred electrophoretically to Immobilon-P or nitrocellulose membranes. Expression, purification, and thrombin cleavage of bPTPα were performed as described (33Guan K.L. Dixon J.E. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 192: 262-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (1641) Google Scholar) except that cells were lysed by sonication in PBS containing 1% Triton X-100 (Sigma), 1% aprotinin, and 1 mg/ml lysozyme. Purified rat brain PKC was the gift of Ushio Kikkawa and was prepared as described (34Kikkawa U. Masayoshi G. Koumoto J. Nishizuka Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1986; 135: 636-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). bPTPα was phosphorylated in vitro by purified PKC under the following reaction conditions: 20 mM Hepes, pH 7.4, 10 mM MgCl2, 0.5 mM CaCl2, 5 mM DTT, 8 μg/ml phosphatidylserine (Sigma), 0.8 μg/ml diolein (Avanti), 100 ng of purified PKC , and 25 μCi of [λ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol, Amersham Corp.). The reaction was incubated for 15 min at 30°C and was terminated by the addition of EDTA to a final concentration of 5 mM. Sample buffer was added, and the samples were then boiled and resolved on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and transferred to nitrocellulose. Following transfer to Immobilon, the phosphoamino acid content of RPTPα was analyzed as described (35Kamps M.P. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 201: 21-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Phosphopeptide maps of in vivo and in vitro32P-labeled proteins were prepared from proteins blotted to nitrocellulose membranes as described (36Luo K. Hurley T.R. Sefton B.M. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 201: 149-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). The liberated peptides were dissolved in pH 1.9 buffer, applied to 100-μm thin-layer cellulose plates, and separated by electrophoresis at pH 1.9 for 30 min at 1.5 kV, followed by ascending chromatography in phosphochromotography buffer (37Boyle W.J. van der Geer P. Hunter T. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 201: 110-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (1276) Google Scholar). Oligonucleotides AGGCGGAAAGCGTTGGAATGA (Ser-180 to Ala) and CCTGTTGGTGGCCGGGGACCT (Ser-204 to Ala) were synthesized on a Cyclone DNA synthesizer (Biosearch). Mutagenesis was carried out using the Amersham oligonucleotide-directed in vitro mutagenesis system according to the manufacturer's manual as described (38van der Geer P. Hunter T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 4698-4709Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The S180A and S204A single mutations and the double mutation were introduced into pGEXKGPTPα and verified by sequencing. Human 293 cells were trypsinized 24 h following transfection and seeded onto Lab-Tek-chambered glass slides (Nunc) that had been treated with 20 μg/ml poly-L-lysine. The cells were grown in DMEM containing 0.5% CS for 24 h and treated with 100 ng/ml TPA or left untreated for controls. Cells were fixed in freshly made 4% paraformaldehyde/PBS at room temperature for 15 min, rinsed three times for 10 min in 0.5 mM glycine/PBS, permeabilized in 0.5% Triton X-100, 0.5 mM glycine/PBS for 10 min, rinsed three times for 10 min in 0.5 mM glycine/PBS, and blocked in 2% normal goat serum, 0.5 mM glycine/PBS for 20 min. Primary anti-RPTPα antibody 5478 was then added to a final dilution of 1:500 and incubated for 1 h in a humidified chamber. The cells were then washed three times for 10 min in 2% normal goat serum, 0.5 mM glycine/PBS, and secondary fluorescein-conjugated goat anti-rabbit Ig (Cappel Labs) was added at a final dilution of 1:50 in 2% normal goat serum, 0.5 mM glycine/PBS and incubated for 20 min. The cells were then washed three times for 10 min in 2% normal goat serum, 0.5 mM glycine/PBS, coverslips were applied to the slides, and the cells were viewed on an Noran Odyssey laser confocal microscope. To study RPTPα in vivo, we raised an antiserum against the predicted C-terminal 19 residues of RPTPα (Fig. 1 A) and additional antisera against bacterially expressed GST fusion proteins containing either the first catalytic domain or the whole cytoplasmic domain of RPTPα. The anti-peptide serum precipitated a 140-kDa protein from [3235S]methionine/cysteine-labeled NIH3T3 cells (Fig. 1 A). Inclusion of the immunizing peptide specifically blocked precipitation of p140. The anti-bacterial fusion protein sera also precipitated p140 (data not shown). The major [35S]methionine/cysteine-labeled tryptic peptides of immunoprecipitated p140 were also present in the 100-kDa product of an in vitro translation reaction of synthetic RPTPα mRNA (data not shown), thus demonstrating that p140 is RPTPα. The size discrepancy is presumably due to glycosylation of p140; there are 8 predicted N-linked glycosylation sites in the extracellular domain of RPTPα. Treatment of NIH3T3 cells with tunicamycin reduced its size from 130 to 110 kDa (data not shown), indicating that RPTPα is N-glycosylated. The residual size difference is presumably due to O-glycosylation events (39Daum G. Regenass S. Sap J. Schlessinger J. Fischer E.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10524-10528Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Pulse-chase analysis indicated that RPTPα maturation proceeds through a ~90-kDa precursor form (data not shown). Daum et al.(39Daum G. Regenass S. Sap J. Schlessinger J. Fischer E.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10524-10528Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) have reached similar conclusions. To determine whether RPTPα is phosphorylated, we immunoprecipitated RPTPα from 32P-labeled NIH3T3 cells. RPTPα was found to be phosphorylated in cells growth arrested in low serum (Fig. 1 B). Several mitogens were tested to determine whether exogenous stimulation of NIH3T3 cells altered RPTPα phosphorylation. The level of phosphorylation increased modestly following stimulation with TPA (Fig. 1 B), platelet-derived growth factor (data not shown), and serum. In different experiments, the level of RPTPα phosphorylation increased 30-50% following TPA treatment (Fig. 1 B), and the increase was maximal by 15 min following TPA stimulation (data not shown). Phosphoamino acid analysis of RPTPα showed it to be phosphorylated predominantly on serine and to a lesser extent on threonine and tyrosine (Fig. 1, C and E). The increase in phosphorylation detected after TPA treatment was reflected in an increase in phosphoserine (Fig. 1, D and F). To determine if the increase in phosphorylation of RPTPα after TPA treatment was due to direct phosphorylation by PKC, the entire cytoplasmic domain of RPTPα (residues 168-793) was expressed in bacteria as a GST fusion protein, purified, and phosphorylated in vitro by PKC purified from rat brain (Fig. 2A). Two-dimensional phosphotryptic mapping of in vivo32P-labeled RPTPα revealed three major phosphopeptides and several minor ones (Fig. 2 B). The pattern of phosphopeptides was unchanged after TPA treatment, but the intensity of the major phosphopeptides increased. Comparison of this pattern with the phosphotryptic map from in vitro phosphorylated bPTPα showed that three of the peptides found in in vivo32P-labeled RPTPα were generated upon PKC phosphorylation. This was confirmed by the comigration of the in vivo and in vitro generated phosphopeptides (Fig. 2 B). The sequence of RPTPα was then examined for tryptic peptides containing possible PKC phosphorylation sites (Ser/Thr-hydrophobic-Arg) (40Pearson R.B. Kemp B.E. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 200: 62-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (873) Google Scholar). Due to its neighboring basic residues and position near the transmembrane domain, characteristics similar to previously described PKC phosphorylation sites (41Hunter T. Ling N. Cooper J.A. Nature. 1984; 311: 480-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar), Ser-180 was chosen as a likely candidate for a PKC site. Ser-180 was mutated to Ala, and the S180A mutant RPTPα was expressed in bacteria and phosphorylated in vitro by PKC. The phosphotryptic map of the S180A mutant bPTPα revealed the loss of peptides B and C, but peptide A remained (Fig. 3 B), indicating that peptides B and C contain Ser-180. The predicted mobility of the tryptic peptide containing Ser-180 is approximately that of peptide B. The N-terminal residue of this peptide is Gln, and cyclization of this residue to pyrocarboxylic acid during the tryptic mapping procedure would yield a more negatively charged, less hydrophilic species at pH 1.9 corresponding to peptide C; a similar situation exists for the major phosphopeptide derived from the autophosphorylated v-Fps protein (42Weinmaster G. Hinze E. Pawson T. J. Virol. 1983; 46: 29-41Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, we believe that peptide C is derived from peptide B during the generation of the tryptic digest. To narrow the list of possible tryptic peptides responsible for the remaining peptide A, manual Edman degradation was performed. Free phosphate was released at the third cycle of degradation, indicating that the phosphoserine was the third residue from the N terminus of the peptide (data not shown). Two RPTPα peptides met this criterion. The tryptic peptide containing Ser-204 was considered the most likely candidate due to its relatively hydrophilic nature. It was also noted that Ser-204 is located in the same cyanogen bromide (CNBr) fragment as Ser-180. If Ser-204 is the second site of PKC phosphorylation, then in vitro phosphorylation of bPTPα should generate a labeled CNBr fragment of ~7 kDa, and trypsin digestion of this fragment should yield all three major phosphopeptides present in the intact protein. In addition, the S180A mutant bPTPα should generate the same CNBr fragment containing only peptide A. To test this hypothesis, in vitro phosphorylated wild type and S180A bPTPα were isolated from an SDS-polyacrylamide gel, excised, cleaved with CNBr, and run on a 20% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. As predicted, a ~7-kDa 32P-labeled band was obtained in both cases. The isolated bands were subjected to tryptic digestion and peptide mapping, and the phosphopeptides were shown to be identical to those obtained following phosphorylation of the intact protein (data not shown). To confirm the identification, Ser-204 was mutated to alanine, and the S204A mutant bPTPα was expressed in bacteria, purified, and phosphorylated in vitro. the S180A/S204A double mutant bPTPα failed to be phosphorylated in vitro by PKC (Fig. 3 A). Moreover, the major phosphopeptide, peptide A, was missing from the peptide map of S204A mutant bPTPα while peptides B and C were still present (Fig. 3 B). Therefore, we conclude that Ser-204 is the other site of PKC phosphorylation in RPTPα. The remaining band in the S180A/S204A lane of approximately the same mobility as bPTPα was shown to be identical to a background band in the GST control lane by tryptic peptide mapping (data not shown). Fig. 3 C illustrates the position of the two phosphorylation sites relative to the membrane spanning domain and the two catalytic domains of RPTPα. To examine the effect of the phosphorylation site mutations in vivo, sequences encoding either the entire wild type or the S180A/S204A RPTPα were expressed from the Sg5 vector by transient transfection of 293 cells, a human embryonic kidney cell line immortalized with adenovirus E1A (Fig. 4 A). As determined by immunoprecipitation of 35S-labeled cells, the level of RPTPα expression in transfected cells was greater than 20 times th"

The half-time for folding of pβ1 into pβ2, the rate-determining step in β folding, was 7 min for wild-type β but 33 min for β lacking both N-linked glycans. The pβ1 → pβ2 half-time was 7.5 min in CHO cells expressing the β subunit missing the Asn13-linked glycan and 10 min for the β subunit missing the Asn30-linked glycan. The inefficient folding of hCG-β lacking both N-linked glycans correlated with the slow formation of the last three disulfide bonds (i.e. disulfides 23-72, 93-100, and 26-110) to form in the hCG-β-folding pathway. Unglycosylated hCG-β was slowly secreted from CHO cells, and β subunit-folding intermediates retained in cells for more than 5 h were degraded into a hCG-β core fragment-like protein.

R. leguminosarum and R. etli O-chains, as released by mild hydrolysis, are polysaccharides that contain Kdo at their reducing ends (12Carlson R.W. Kalembasa S. Turowski D. Pachori P. Noel K.D. J. Bacteriol. 1987; 169: 4923-4928Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 13Carlson R.W. J. Bacteriol. 1984; 158: 1012-1017Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This Kdo may be the outermost core glycosyl residue to which the O-chain is transferred during the biosynthesis of the LPS. Synthesis of the core oligosaccharide and O-chain portion of the LPS requires lps genes from at least five regions of the R. etli CE3 genome, as defined by cosmid genetic cloning (5Noel K.D. Verma D.P.S. Molecular Signals in Plant-Microbe Communications. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1992: 341-357Google Scholar, 14Cava J.R. Elias P.M. Turowski D.A. Noel K.D. J.

Most of the genes that have been identified are located in a stretch of the chromosome, termed the lps α region (5Noel K.D. Verma D.P.S. Molecular Signals in Plant-Microbe Communications. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1992: 341-357Google Scholar), in which nine complementation groups have been identified within 18 kilobases of DNA (16Cava J.R. Tao H. Noel K.D. MGG. 1990; 221: 125-128Crossref Scopus (23) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). It appears that this region carries genes for synthesis of at least the strain-specific O-chain glycosyl residues and linkages (17Brink B.A. Miller J. Carlson R.W. Noel K.D. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 548-555Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and at least one gene necessary for core oligosaccharide synthesis as well (9Bhat U.R. Bhagyalakshmi S.K. Carlson R.W. Carbohydr. Res. 1991; 220: 219-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 18Carlson R.W. Garcia F. Noel K.D. Hollingsworth R.I. Carbohydr. Res. 1990; 195: 101-110Crossref Scopus (20) Google Scholar). R. leguminosarum, R. etli, and Bradyrhizobium japonicum mutants that are deficient in the LPS O-chain polysaccharide elicit incomplete infections and root nodule development on their legume hosts (5Noel K.D. Verma D.P.S. Molecular Signals in Plant-Microbe Communications. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1992: 341-357Google Scholar, 14Cava J.R. Elias P.M. Turowski D.A. Noel K.D. J.

Plant Microbe Interact. 1994; 7: 99-112Crossref Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Although all LPS mutants that are defective in symbiosis have deficient or altered O-chain-containing LPS, it had not been ruled out in previous studies that these mutants might also be defective in the core oligosaccharides. In fact, the LPSs from two R. etli mutants have truncated core structures (9Bhat U.R. Bhagyalakshmi S.K. Carlson R.W. Carbohydr. Res. 1991; 220: 219-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 18Carlson R.W. Garcia F. Noel K.D. Hollingsworth R.I. Carbohydr. Res. 1990; 195: 101-110Crossref Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Therefore, one motive for this study was to determine whether or not an intact core portion of the LPS is sufficient for symbiotic proficiency. Another motive was to infer specific biosynthetic functions for particular genetic loci within lps α region by correlating mapped mutations with LPS structural defects. In addition, the results of this study suggest a definition for the biosynthetic core and the linkage between a particular core sugar and the Kdo residue which is at the reducing end of the O-chain polysaccharide. The bacterial strains used in this study are given in Table I. Bacteria were grown in TY medium with added calcium as described previously (12Carlson R.W. Kalembasa S. Turowski D. Pachori P. Noel K.D. J. Bacteriol. 1987; 169: 4923-4928Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar).Table IBacterial strains Open table in a new tab Bacteria were harvested by centrifugation and the pellets extracted using the hot phenol-water extraction procedure as described previously (12Carlson R.W. Kalembasa S. Turowski D. Pachori P. Noel K.D. J. Bacteriol. 1987; 169: 4923-4928Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 21Westphal O. Jann K. Methods Carbohydr. Chem. 1965; 5: 83-91Google Scholar). The LPSs were further purified from the aqueous layer, as described previously (12Carlson R.W. Kalembasa S. Turowski D. Pachori P. Noel K.D. J. Bacteriol. 1987; 169: 4923-4928Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 21Westphal O. Jann K. Methods Carbohydr. Chem. 1965; 5: 83-91Google Scholar), by digestion with RNase and DNase, followed by extensive dialysis against deionized water using 12,000-14,000 MWC dialysis tubing, and freeze-dried. The LPS from the parent strain, CE3, had also been further purified by gel-filtration chromatography using Sepharose 4B in and EDTA/triethylamine buffer at pH 7 (12Carlson R.W. Kalembasa S. Turowski D. Pachori P. Noel K.D. J. Bacteriol. 1987; 169: 4923-4928Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 22Carlson R.W. Sanders R.E. Napoli C. Albersheim P. Plant Physiol. 1978; 62: 912-917Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Separation of higher from lower molecular weight forms of LPS was accomplished by gel filtration chromatography on Sephadex G-150 in the presence of deoxycholate (DOC) as described previously (23Reuhs B.L. Carlson R.W. Kim J.S. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 3570-3580Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 24Reuhs B.L. Kim J.S. Badgett A. Carlson R.W. Mol. Plant Microbe Interact. 1994; 7: 240-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 25Peterson A.A. McGroarty E.J. J. Bacteriol. 1985; 162: 738-745Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). PAGE analysis was performed using 18% acrylamide gels with DOC as the detergent (26Krauss J.H. Weckesser J. Mayer H. Int. J. Syst. Bacteriol. 1988; 38: 157-163Crossref Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The gels were silver stained as described (27Tsai C. Frisch C.E. Anal. Biochem. 1982; 119: 115-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (2317) Google Scholar). Each LPS was dissolved in deionized water (10 mg/ml), acetic acid was added to 1%, and the solution heated at 100°C for 1 h. This procedure hydrolyzes the ketosidic bond between the polysaccharide Kdo residue and the lipid A, which precipitates (28Ryan J.M. Conrad H.E. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1974; 162: 530-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The lipid A was removed by centrifugation, and the carbohydrate was further purified by HPAEC on a CarboPacTM PA1 column (DIONEX) using a gradient comprised of 1 M NaOAc (A) and 100 mm NaOH (B); 10% A and 90% B for 10 min and then to 50% A and 50% B by 40 min. The various carbohydrate peaks were collected, the acetate was removed by passage through DIONEX OnGuard H cartridges, and the eluants freeze-dried. Glycosyl compositions were determined by the preparation and gas liquid chromatographic (GLC)-mass spectrometric (MS) analysis of alditol acetates, or trimethylsilyl methyl glycosides (29York W.S. Darvill A.G. McNeil M. Stevenson T.T. Albersheim P. Methods Enzymol. 1985; 118: 3-40Crossref Scopus (1062) Google Scholar), and glycosyl linkages were determined by methylation analysis using the Hakomori procedure as described by York et al.(29York W.S. Darvill A.G. McNeil M. Stevenson T.T. Albersheim P. Methods Enzymol. 1985; 118: 3-40Crossref Scopus (1062) Google Scholar). For the isolated core oligosaccharides, it was necessary to reduce the samples with NaBD4 prior to methylation. Also, for certain samples, after methylation, it was necessary to reduce the carboxymethyl groups of the acidic sugars with lithium triethylborodeuteride (Superdeuteride from Aldrich) (29York W.S. Darvill A.G. McNeil M. Stevenson T.T. Albersheim P. Methods Enzymol. 1985; 118: 3-40Crossref Scopus (1062) Google Scholar). Alditol acetates of the methylated samples were prepared by hydrolysis, reduction with NaBD4, and acetylation with acetic anhydride in pyridine as described by York et al.(29York W.S. Darvill A.G. McNeil M. Stevenson T.T. Albersheim P. Methods Enzymol. 1985; 118: 3-40Crossref Scopus (1062) Google Scholar). Combined GLC-MS was performed using an HP5890-5970 GLC-MSD system equipped with a 30-m SP2330 fused silica column from Supelco for the alditol and partially methylated alditol acetates (PMAAs), or with a 30-m DB-1 column from J& Scientific for trimethylsilyl methyl glycosides. Fast atom bombardment-mass spectrometry (FAB-MS) was performed using a VG ZAB-SE instrument at an accelerating voltage of 8 kV. Approximately 2-10 μg of sample was placed on the probe. Thioglycerol was used as the matrix. Electrospray mass spectrometry (ES-MS) was performed using a SCIEX API-III mass analyzer operated in the positive mode with an orifice of 50 V. Samples were dissolved in 20% aqueous acetonitrile and pumped into the mass spectrometer at a rate of 3 μl/min. Samples were exchanged several times with D2O, dissolved in D2O and analyzed at 295°K using a Bruker AM500 spectrometer. Chemical shifts were measured relative to the HOD resonance, which, in turn, was measured relative to sodium 3-trimethylsilylpropionate-2,2,3,3-d4. The LPSs from R. etli CE3 and various mutants were analyzed by DOC-PAGE (Fig. 2). LPS I and LPS II were the major components of the parent (CE3) LPS. The LPS I band was detected in greatly reduced amount in the LPS from CE359 and not detected in any LPSs from the other mutants examined. All of the mutant LPS preparations contained LPS II and, in addition, other low molecular weight forms of LPS designated LPS III (CE350), LPS IV (CE121, CE356, CE357), and LPS V (CE359, CE360). The only exception was the LPS preparation from CE358 which contained only LPS II. These different forms of LPS were distinguishable by their differing abilities to bind four monoclonal antibodies (JIM26, JIM27, JIM28, and JIM29); i.e. it was previously reported that LPS IV and V bind all four monoclonals while LPS III binds only JIM26, and LPS II does not bind to any of the monoclonals (30Tao H. Brewin N.J. Noel K.D. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 2222-2229Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Analysis of the mild acid hydrolysate from CE3 LPS by HPAEC showed (Fig. 3A) the presence of five components, OS1-OS5. Fractions OS1 and OS2 were identified as monomeric Kdo and GalA, respectively, by comparing retention times to those of authentic standards. The monomeric Kdo, OS1, eluted as several peaks due to the formation of various anhydro forms during the mild acid hydrolysis procedure (31McNicholas P.A. Batley M. Redmond J.W. Carbohydr. Res. 1987; 165: 17-22Crossref Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 32McNicholas P.A. Batley M. Redmond J.W. Carbohydr. Res. 1986; 146: 219-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Subjection of standard Kdo to the mild acid hydrolysis conditions resulted in the same peaks as those observed for OS1 from the LPS samples. Preparation and GLC-MS analysis of the trimethylsilyl methylglycosides of OS2 showed that it was composed of only GalA. Proton NMR analysis of OS3 and 5 showed that their spectra (not shown) matched those published (18Carlson R.W. Garcia F. Noel K.D. Hollingsworth R.I. Carbohydr. Res. 1990; 195: 101-110Crossref Scopus (20) Google Scholar) for the major tetra- and trisaccharide components, respectively, from this LPS; therefore, these previously reported structures (Structures I and II shown above) can be assigned to OS3 and OS5. Oligosaccharide OS4 had the same glycosyl composition as the tetrasaccharide, OS3; namely, GalA, Man, Gal, and Kdo. The relative molar ratio of OS2 (GalA)/OS3 + OS4 (tetramers)/OS5(trimer) was 1:1:1 and was determined using molar response factors of standard monomeric GalA for OS2 and of a pectic trisaccharide for OS3, OS4, and OS5. As stated above, the glycosyl composition of OS4 was the same as that for OS3. Methylation analysis also showed that OS4 had the same glycosyl linkages as OS3; namely, terminal-GalA/terminal-Gal/4,6-linked Man in a 1:1:1 ratio. The methylation procedure used for this analysis destroyed the Kdo residue and prevented its analysis; however, the various types of Kdo linkages in these LPSs are described below. Analysis by negative FAB-MS of the oligosaccharides prior to purification by HPAEC showed [M-H]- ions of m/z 589, 719, and 737. The ions of m/z 589 and 737 are due to the tri- and tetrasaccharides (Structures II and I, respectively). The ion at m/z 719 is consistent with a tetrasaccharide that lacks a water molecule, i.e. minus 18 atomic mass units, and could be due a lactone or anhydro version of this molecule. Fractions OS3 and OS4, purified by HPAEC, were reduced with NaBD4, permethylated, and analyzed by ES-MS, Fig. 4, A and B. Fraction OS3 gave the ions expected for a molecule derived from a tetrasaccharide that contained the expected reducing Kdo pyranose residue; namely, [M+NH4]+ and [M+NH4+Na+]+ of m/z 983 and 1005, respectively. Analysis of OS4, Fig. 4B, resulted in ions of m/z 937 and 959, [M+NH4]+ and [M+NH4+Na+]+, respectively. These latter ions were also present in OS3 indicating that this fraction was contaminated with some anhydro or lactone form of the tetrasaccharide. The 46 atomic mass units difference between OS3 and OS4 is not consistent with a lactone which would have been reduced with NaBD4; however, it is consistent with an anhydro-Kdo derivative. NMR analysis of OS4 gave a complex spectrum (not shown). The complexity of the spectrum may indicate that OS4 contained more than one type of anhydro-Kdo residue. The typical resonances for the methylene protons from the reducing Kdo pyranose residue of OS3 (δ 1.8 and 2.1) were absent. This apparent lack of the Kdo methylene proton resonances can occur for oligosaccharides containing certain anhydro forms of Kdo (33Carlson R.W. Krishnaiah B.S. Carbohydr. Res. 1992; 231: 205-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). In a 4,7- or 4,8-anhydro-Kdo residue, the methylene geminal protons are adjacent to a C-2 carbonyl rather than to the hemi-ketal C-2 of a normal reducing Kdo pyranose and are, therefore, quite acidic and easily exchanged with deuterium during preparation of the sample for NMR analysis. Additionally, if not fully exchanged with deuterium, the chemical shifts of such geminal methylene protons are shifted far downfield (e.g. to δ 2.90 and 3.3 (33Carlson R.W. Krishnaiah B.S. Carbohydr. Res. 1992; 231: 205-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar)) compared to their resonances in the tetramer with a normal Kdo pyranose residue (e.g. δ 1.8 and 2.1). This combination of deuterium exchange and downfield chemical shift into the region near the glycosyl ring protons, make these methylene protons difficult to observe under the best conditions. Thus, glycosyl composition, glycosyl linkage, mass spectrometry, and NMR analyses support the conclusion that OS4 is a version of the tetrasaccharide that contains either a 4,7- or a 4,8-anhydro-Kdo residue at its reducing end; i.e. α-Gal-(1→6)-[α-GalA-(1→4)]-α-Man-(1→5)-[4,7- or 4,8-anhydro]-Kdo. Fig. 3B shows the HPAEC profile of the mild acid hydrolysates from mutant CE358. The HPAEC profiles for strains CE350, CE357, CE356, CE121, CE359, and CE360 were identical to that of CE3 (Fig. 3A). For strain CE358, OS3 and 4 were replaced by OS6. The relatively short retention time of OS6 indicates that it is not as acidic as the other oligosaccharide components. This was confirmed by chemical analysis which is described further below. As in the CE3 parent LPS, the GalA/tetramer/trimer ratio for all the mutant LPSs, except that from CE358 in which OS6 replaces OS3 and OS4, is 1:1:1. Thus, of the strains examined in this report, only strain CE358 (from complementation group I) appears to be altered in the core oligosaccharides that are released from the LPS by mild acid hydrolysis. Negative ion FAB-MS analysis (spectrum not shown) of the mild acid hydrolysate of CE358 LPS gave two major ions; one of [M-H]-m/z = 589 which was due to the GalA2Kdo trisaccharide (OS5,), and one of [M-H]-m/z = 561 which was consistent with a trisaccharide consisting of 2 hexosyl (Hex) and 1 Kdo residues, Hex2Kdo. These results were confirmed by ES-MS analysis of the reduced permethylated oligosaccharides, Fig. 5. The Hex2Kdo trisaccharide (OS6) was isolated by HPAEC and its structure deduced by glycosyl composition, linkage, and NMR analyses. Composition analysis showed that it consisted of Gal, Man, and Kdo. Glycosyl linkage analysis of the neutral sugars showed the presence of terminal Gal and 6-linked Man. The proton NMR spectrum of OS6 (spectrum not shown) matched that previously reported for a Hex2Kdo trisaccharide from another α region mutant, CE109 (18Carlson R.W. Garcia F. Noel K.D. Hollingsworth R.I. Carbohydr. Res. 1990; 195: 101-110Crossref Scopus (20) Google Scholar). This result was consistent with the fact that HPAEC analysis of the mild acid hydrolysate of CE109 LPS also showed the presence of OS6 (data not shown). Thus NMR, FAB-MS, and HPAEC analyses strongly suggest that OS6 from CE358 has the same structure as that previously reported (9Bhat U.R. Bhagyalakshmi S.K. Carlson R.W. Carbohydr. Res. 1991; 220: 219-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 18Carlson R.W. Garcia F. Noel K.D. Hollingsworth R.I. Carbohydr. Res. 1990; 195: 101-110Crossref Scopus (20) Google Scholar) CE109 trisaccharide; namely, α-Gal-(1→6)-α-Man-(1→5)-Kdo. The above results showed that only one mutant, CE358, was altered in the core oligosaccharides released by mild acid hydrolysis of its LPS. However, it was necessary to examine the mutant LPSs prior to mild acid hydrolysis in order to determine if there were other differences that may not have been detectable due to the mild acid hydrolysis conditions. Small amounts of the LPSs were methylated and carboxymethyl reduced. This was followed by the preparation and GLC-MS analysis of the PMAAs. Fig. 6 shows the results for the LPSs from strains CE350, 357, and 358 which represent the three types of LPSs observed. The LPSs from the other mutants had the same glycosyl linkages as shown for strain CE357. Peak 1, which was present only in the LPS from strain CE350, had a retention time and fragmentation pattern consistent with the PMAA of terminal Gal (m/z = 205, 162, 118, 161). Peak 2 was present only in the LPS from strain CE358 and was due to the PMAA of 6-linked Man (m/z = 233, 189, 162, 118). Peak 3, in the case of CE350 LPS, was due to the PMAA of terminal GalA (m/z = 235, 191, 162, 118) in which the carboxyl group had been reduced with NaBD4 prior to hydrolysis and acetylation. Minor ions of m/z = 233 and 189 were present in peak 3 from CE350 LPS and indicated the presence of small amounts of 6-linked Gal. In the case of the LPSs from CE358 and CE357, as well as the other remaining mutant LPSs, terminal galactose (peak 1) was not detected, and peak 3 consisted of a mixture of the PMAAs derived from 6-linked Gal and terminal GalA; m/z = 235 (233), 191 (189), 162, 118. The ratio of the 233:235 (or 189:191) ion intensities is somewhat reflective of the 6-linked Gal/terminal GalA ratio and was 0.077, 0.15, and 0.23 for the LPSs from CE350, CE357, and CE358, respectively. The larger ratio for CE358 compared with that for CE357 LPS was consistent with the fact that the former LPS lacks one of the GalA residues. Peak 4 was the PMAA of 4,6-linked Man (m/z = 261,118) and was found in the LPSs from all the mutants except CE358 which contained only 6-linked Man (peak 2). With one exception, these data are consistent with structures of the oligosaccharides released by mild acid hydrolysis. The exception is that the Gal residue in the mild acid released oligosaccharides is terminally linked while it is 6-linked in the intact LPSs, except for that from CE350 in which it is largely terminally linked. Thus, in these LPSs, except for the LPS from CE350, the Gal of the core tetrasaccharide has a mild acid labile residue, presumably Kdo, attached at O-6. Since it is known that the O-chain polysaccharide purified by mild acid hydrolysis has a Kdo residue at its reducing end, it is likely that it is this residue which is attached to O-6 of Gal in these intact LPSs. The linkages of the Kdo residues for several of the LPSs, e.g. from strains CE357 and CE358, were determined by methylation, carboxymethyl reduction (lithium triethylborodeuteride), mild acid hydrolysis (0.1 M trifluoroacetic acid at 80°C for 30 min), reduction (sodium borodeuteride), normal acid hydrolysis (2 M trifluoroacetic acid at 121° for 2 h), reduction (sodium borodeuteride), and preparation of the PMAAs. Three types of Kdo residues were found in these LPSs; terminally linked Kdo (primary fragments of m/z 89, 205, 206, 250, and 366), 5-linked Kdo (m/z 89, 206, and 394), and 4,5-linked Kdo (m/z 89, and 422). The 4,5- and 5-linked Kdo residues are consistent with the tri- and tetrasaccharide core oligosaccharide structures, and the terminal Kdo is presumably due, in part, to the Kdo residue that is attached to O-6 of the core tetrasaccharide Gal residue. Thus, it is likely that the core structure for the LPSs from CE3 and its mutants, except for CE350, contains terminal Kdo attached to O-6 of the Gal residue. In summary, these methylation results from the intact LPSs showed (a) that the intact core region of these LPSs contain a Kdo residue attached to O-6 of the Gal residue, (b) that this Kdo residue is the likely site of O-chain attachment, and (c) that the LPS from mutant CE350 lacks this Kdo residue. Alditol acetate analysis of the intact LPSs from CE350, 356, 357, 359, 360, and 121 show that they all contain small amounts of glycosyl residues previously reported (12Carlson R.W. Kalembasa S. Turowski D. Pachori P. Noel K.D. J. Bacteriol. 1987; 169: 4923-4928Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) to be in the O-chain polysaccharide, e.g. GlcA, methylated Rha, Fuc, methylated Fuc, and quinovosamine (Qvn). Since PAGE and immunoblot analyses (30Tao H. Brewin N.J. Noel K.D. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 2222-2229Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) showed that the monoclonals only bind to LPS I, III, IV, or V, and not to LPS II, these results indicate that the minor amounts of LPS III, IV, and/or V that are present in these mutants are forms of the LPS that contain various truncated O-chains. This was confirmed by purifying a small amount of LPS IV from strain CE121 using gel filtration chromatography in the presence of DOC. Analysis of this LPS IV showed the presence of GlcA/2-O-MeRha/Fuc/2,3-di-O-MeFuc/Man/Qvn = 1:1:1:1:1:1. The LPS from the parent strain, CE3, has these sugars in roughly a 4:4:4:1:1:1 ratio with the exception that a 2,3,4-tri-MeFuc residue replaces the 2,3-di-O-MeFuc residue. The repeating unit of this O-chain is comprised of GlcA/2-O-MeRha/Fuc in a 1:1:1 ratio.2 2R. W. Carlson and U. R. Bhat, unpublished data. Thus, the reduced level of these sugars in LPS IV and its faster PAGE mobility compared with that for LPS I are consistent with the concept that LPS IV has a truncated O-chain. The results described above suggest that the “rough” LPSs (i.e. LPS II) from the parent and mutant strains have the structures shown in Fig. 7. The site of attachment of the core region to the lipid A, and the lipid A structure, have been described in a previous report (11Bhat U.R. Forsberg L.S. Carlson R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14402-14410Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The LPS II core region is comprised of the previously reported tetra- and trisaccharide molecules (9Bhat U.R. Bhagyalakshmi S.K. Carlson R.W. Carbohydr. Res. 1991; 220: 219-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 18Carlson R.W. Garcia F. Noel K.D. Hollingsworth R.I. Carbohydr. Res. 1990; 195: 101-110Crossref Scopus (20) Google Scholar) (Structures I and II), with a Kdo residue linked to O-6 of the tetrasaccharide Gal residue. This Kdo residue may be the site of O-chain attachment. The results described above also show that mild acid hydrolysis releases monomeric GalA from all of the LPSs. Thus, the core region must contain a “GalA-1 → X” in which X is an unidentified substituent or chemical environment which renders the GalA glycoside bond labile to mild acid. The mechanism by which monomeric GalA is released from the LPS by mild acid hydrolysis is not yet understood. The precise arrangement of the core components in the intact LPS is not known. It is possible that the tri- and tetrasaccharides are present on two different types of LPS molecules. However, their presence in approximately a 1:1 ratio in both the parent and in all of the mutant LPSs indicates that there may be a single LPS species which contains all of the core elements. Further work is in progress to structurally characterize the intact core region of these LPSs. The two mutants which vary in their core structures are CE350 and CE358. The core region from strain CE350 lacks the Kdo residue that is normally attached to O-6 of Gal, and the core region from strain CE358 lacks the GalA residue that is normally attached to O-4 of the Man residue. The missing Kdo residue in CE350 LPS suggests that the defective gene in this mutant may encode a specific CMP-Kdo transferase. It should be noted that glycosyl linkage analysis of the CE350 LPS suggests that a small portion of the Gal residues has Kdo at O-6. Thus, this mutation does not lead to a complete lack of this Kdo residue. That some of the CE350 LPS molecules have this Kdo residue, and that a truncated version of the O-chain is attached to that residue, is supported by the fact that CE350 LPS preparations have LPS III, contain small amounts of O-chain sugars, and bind the JIM26 monoclonal antibody. On the other hand the LPS from strain CE358 seems to consist only of LPS II, and completely lacks O-chain sugars, suggesting that (a) the GalA residue that is missing from the O-4 position of the Man residue may be required for transfer of O-chain to the core region, and (b) that the defective gene in CE358 may encode a UDP-GalA transferase. Other than those of CE350 and CE358, LPSs analyzed in this study have all of the core components and contain various forms of truncated O-chain as evidenced by the presence of typical O-chain glycosyl residues. Since all of these mutants are symbiotically defective (14Cava J.R. Elias P.M. Turowski D.A. Noel K.D. J. Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 8-15Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Cava J.R. Tao H. Noel K.D.

Although distinct functions have been ascribed to certain of these isoforms, the effect of particular inserted domains on the ligand-binding specificity of the CD44 molecule remains unclear. In the present study, we demonstrate that while CD44H, the major CD44 isoform expressed on resting hemopoietic cells, and CD44R1, an alternatively spliced isoform present on transformed epithelial cells and certain activated and/or malignant hemopoietic cell types, can both bind avidly to hyaluronan, only CD44R1 can promote homotypic cellular aggregation when expressed in the CD44-negative murine lymphoma cell line TILL Experiments in which TIL1 cells transduced with different CD44 isoforms were tested for their ability to adhere to one another or to COS7 cells transfected with CD44R1, indicated that CD44R1 can recognize and bind a common determinant present on both CD44H and CD44R1. Monoclonal antibody blocking studies suggest further, that the determinant recognized by CD44R1 is located in a region of the CD44 molecule distinct from that involved in hyaluronan binding.

CD44 is a broadly distributed cell surface glycoprotein that has been shown to play an important role in many adhesion-dependent cellular processes including lymphocyte recirculation, hemopoiesis, NK-cell-mediated killing, macrophage and lymphocyte activation, and tumor metastasis (1Haynes B.F.

Kincade P.W. J. Exp. Med. 1990; 171: 477-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (530) Google Scholar), it is becoming increasingly clear that not all CD44-dependent adhesion events involve recognition of this particular ligand (7Culty M.

CD44 is a very polymorphic molecule, and species ranging in size from 80 to 250 kDa have been detected on various normal and transformed cell types (2Haynes B.F. Liao H.-X. Patton K.L.

Although some of this heterogeneity can be attributed to differences in the post-translational modification of a common polypeptide core (9Jalkanen S. Jalkanen M. Bargatze R. Tammi M. Butcher E.C. J.

In this regard, we and others have demonstrated that the alternative splicing of a series of 10 contiguous exons present within a single copy CD44 gene can produce higher molecular mass CD44 isoforms that contain additional peptide sequences of varying length inserted into a single site within the extracellular domain of the molecule proximal to the membrane spanning domain (10Brown T.A.

Interestingly, several recent studies have ascribed unique functional activities to certain of these alternatively spliced CD44 isoforms (13Günthert U. Hofmann M. Rudy W. Reber S. Zöller M.

Science. 1992; 257: 682-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar), raising the possibility that the inclusion of additional peptide sequences within the extracellular domain of CD44 may alter the ligand-binding specificity of the molecule (14Stamenkovic I. Aruffo A. Seed B. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 343-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar). In the present study we demonstrate that while CD44H, the major CD44 isoform present on resting hemopoietic cells, and CD44R1, a differentially expressed isoform containing a 132-amino acid insertion encoded by the alternatively spliced exons v8-vl0 (12Dougherty G.J.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 1225-1229Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar), can both bind immobilized and soluble hyaluronan when transfected into the CD44-negative murine lymphoma cell line TIL1, only the expression of CD44R1 can induce these cells to homotypically aggregate. Cell mixing studies further suggest that such homotypic aggregation is mediated by the adhesive interaction between a determinant encoded by the inserted region present in CD44R1, and a common region shared by both CD44R1 and CD44H. The SV40-transformed simian fibroblastoid cell line COS7 and the human erythroleukemia cell line K562 were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Rockville, MD). CD44 expression was induced on K562 cells by stimulation for 48 h with 10 ng/ml phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate (Sigma). The murine lymphoma cell line TIL1 was derived from a tumor initiated in C3Hf7Sed//Kam mice by the subcutaneous inoculation of syngeneic Fsa-R fibrosarcoma cells that had been genetically engineered through retroviral-mediated gene transfer to express murine interleukin-7 (19McBride W.H. Thacker J.D. Comora S. Economou J.S. Kelly D. Hogge D. Dubinett S.M. Dougherty G.J. Cancer Res. 1992; 52: 3931-3937PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, the tumor was disaggregated by mincing, and tumor pieces placed in a flask together with approximately 50 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DME) 1The abbreviations used are: DME, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; FCS, fetal calf serum; FCI, fetal clone I; mAb, monoclonal antibody; PAGE, Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; HBSS, Hanks’ balanced salt solution; FITC-HA, fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled human umbilical cord hyaluronan; FACS, fluorescence-activated cell sorter. (StemCell Technologies Inc., Vancouver, Canada) containing 10% fetal calf serum (FCS) (Hyclone, Logan, UT) (DME + 10% FCS). After approximately 2 weeks in culture, nonadherent cells were transferred to a separate flask and this procedure repeated daily until all adherent fibroblastoid tumor cells were removed. The cell line obtained, designated TIL1, expresses CD4 and CD8, αβ TcR, and LFA-1, but is negative for Mac-1, pl50,95, and CD44. These cells do not contain retroviral vector-derived sequences, nor do they produce interleukin-7. They are, however, malignant and generate a localized ascitic tumor following intraperitoneal injection into syngeneic C3H/HeJ mice. Both K562 and TIL1 cells were maintained in DME + 10% fetal clone I (FCI) (Hyclone, Logan, UT). The generation and characterization of the CD44 mAbs 7F4, 8D8, and 5A4 will be described in detail elsewhere. 2G. J. Dougherty, P. M. Lansdorp, C. Smith, and A. Droll, manuscript in preparation. To generate the additional CD44 mAbs 2B5, 4A4, and 3G12, female C3H/HeJ mice aged 8–10 weeks received at 21-day intervals, three intraperitoneal injections of approximately 107 syngeneic Fsa-NJhCD44Rl tumor cells (see below). Four days after the last injection, spleen cells from the immunized animals were fused with Sp2/0 myeloma cells as described previously (20Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988Google Scholar), and plated directly into ClonaCell hybridoma selection medium, as per the manufacturer's instructions (StemCell Technologies Inc.). After 12 days in culture, individual hybridoma colonies were picked into 100 µl of DME + 10% FCI. 48 h later hybridoma supernatants were screened for differential reactivity with Fsa-NJhCD44Rl and control Fsa-NJneo cells using a cell enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay technique (21Lansdorp P.M. Astaldi G.C.B. Oosterhof F. Janssen M.C. Zeijlemaker W.P. J. Immunol. Methods. 1980; 39: 393-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Promising mAbs were tested against a panel of human and transfected mouse cell lines by FACS and Western blot analysis to confirm reactivity with CD44. Details concerning the generation and characterization of the CD44 exon v10-specific mAb 2G1 will be given elsewhere. 3G. J. Dougherty, R. K. Chiu, and A. Droll, manuscript in preparation.

A. 1987; 84: 8458-8462Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar) was used to introduce and express human CD44H and CD44R1 in TIL1 cells. Briefly, full-length CD44H and CD44R1 cDNAs derived, respectively, from the plasmids pCDM8.CD44cl2.7 and pCDM8.CD44cl2.3 (12Dougherty G.J. Lansdorp P.M. Cooper D.L. Humphries R. K J. Exp. Med. 1991; 174: 1-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar) were inserted into the XbaI site of pTZ19R/Tk-neo (23Hughs P.F.D. Thacker D. Hogge D. Sutherland H.J. Thomas T.E. Lansdorp P.M. Eaves C.J. Humphries R.K. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 89: 1817-1824Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). SmaI-HindIII cassettes containing CD44H or CD44R1 together with Tk-neo were isolated and cloned into HpaI-HindIII cut Jzen.1. The plasmids obtained were transfected into the ecotropic packaging line GP+E-86 (24Markowitz D. Goff S. Bank A. J. Virol. 1988; 62: 1120-1124Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) by calcium phosphate precipitation and transfected cells selected in G418 (0.5 mg/ml active weight) (Life Technologies Inc., Grand Island, NY). Supernatants conditioned by the packaging line for 24 h contained >106 colony-forming units/ml. TIL1 cells were infected with cell free JhCD44H or JhCD44Rl viral supernatants containing 5 µg/ml Poly-brene (Sigma), as described previously (23Hughs P.F.D. Thacker D. Hogge D. Sutherland H.J. Thomas T.E. Lansdorp P.M. Eaves C.J. Humphries R.K. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 89: 1817-1824Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Infected cells were selected and maintained in medium containing G418 (0.3 mg/ml active weight). To ensure that any heterogeneity present within the starting TIL1 cell population was retained, at least 200 clones were pooled and expanded for further study. Transduced cells were regularly examined by FACS analysis (see below) to confirm continued high level expression of the introduced genes. FACS analysis of CD44 expression on retrovirally transduced TIL1 cells was carried out as described previously (19McBride W.H. Thacker J.D. Comora S. Economou J.S. Kelly D. Hogge D. Dubinett S.M. Dougherty G.J. Cancer Res. 1992; 52: 3931-3937PubMed Google Scholar). Transfected TIL1 cells were resuspended at 2 × 107 cells/ml in PBS containing 1% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 5 mM EDTA, and 10 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Lysates were incubated on ice for 15 min, microcentrifuged for 5 min to pellet nuclei and other insoluble cell debris, and stored at –70 °C until required. Aliquots were rapidly thawed, added to an equal volume of nonreducing sample buffer containing 125 mM Tris, 20% (v/v) glycerol, 4.6% (w/v) SDS, pH 6.8, and incubated at 100 °C for 5 min. Total cellular proteins were separated on SDS-PAGE gels and transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes (Schleicher & Schuell, Inc.) as described previously (25Hakomori S. Kannagi R. Weir D.M. Herzenberg L.A. Blackwell C. Herzenberg L.A. Handbook of Experimental Immunology. Blackwell Scientific Publications, Edinburgh1986: 9.1-9.39Google Scholar). Nonspecific binding sites were blocked by incubating the filters at 4 °C overnight in PBS containing 5% (w/v) milk protein. After washing in HBSS, filters were incubated at room temperature for 4 h with mAb tissue culture supernatant, washed with HBSS, and incubated for a further 1 h at room temperature with a 1:100 dilution of horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Dako, Carpinteria, CA) in DME + 10% FCI. After extensive washing in HBSS, the reaction was developed in PBS containing 0.06% (w/v) 3–3′-diaminobenzidine (Sigma) and 0.012% (v/v) hydrogen peroxide (Sigma). The wells of a 96-well tissue culture plate were coated with hyaluronan by adding 100 µl of a solution of potassium hyaluronate purified from human umbilical cord (Sigma) (5 mg/ml in PBS) to each well and incubating the plate at 4 °C overnight. Unbound hyaluronan was removed by extensive washing with HBSS and the wells blocked by incubation for a further 1 h with 100 µl of PBS containing 1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin (Sigma). Infected TIL1 cells were fluorescently labeled by incubating for 30 min at 37 °C in HBSS containing 5 µg/ml Calcein (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). After extensive washing in DME + 10% FCI, approximately 1 × 104 labeled TIL1 cells in a final volume of 100 µl of DME + 10% FCI were added to each well. In some experiments, the cells were incubated in mAb tissue culture supernatants for 30 min on ice and washed extensively at room temperature before being added to hyaluronan-coated wells. Plates were incubated at room temperature for 15 min and any unattached cells removed by sealing the plate with plastic film and centrifuging inverted for 5 min at 400 rpm. The number of cells bound to each well was quantitated using a fluorescence plate reader (Millipore, Malborough, MA). Fluorescein-labeled human umbilical cord hyaluronan (FITC-HA), prepared as described previously (26De Belder A.N. Wik K.O. Carbohydr. Res. 1975; 44: 251-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar), was a generous gift from Dr. Saghi Ghaffari, Terry Fox Laboratory. To quantitate the binding of soluble hyaluronan to retrovirally transduced TIL1 cells, log phase cultures were harvested by vigorous pipetting, the cells washed extensively with HBSS + 2% FCS, and resuspended in HBSS + 2% FCS containing 2 µg/ml FITC-HA. Following incubation at room temperature for 1 h, the cells were washed 3 times with HBSS + 2% FCS, resuspended in HBSS containing 1 µg/ml propridium iodide, and analyzed for fluorescence intensity on a FACSort (Becton Dickinson, Mountain View, CA.) 5 × 105 transduced TIL1 cells in a final volume of 0.5 ml of PBS were added to the wells of a 24-well plate (Nunc, Life Technologies Inc., Burlington, Ontario, Canada). Plates were taped to the deck of a Mistral Multi-Mixer platform shaker (Lab-Line Instruments Inc., Melrose Park, IL) and agitated at one-third maximal speed for 30 min at room temperature. In some experiments the cells were first incubated for 30 min at 0 °C with mAb tissue culture supernatants and washed extensively at room temperature before being added to the wells. In others, equal numbers (2.5 × 105) of Calcein-labeled and unlabeled cells were mixed together before being added to the wells and allowed to aggregate as described above. The cellular clusters produced were photographed under both visible and UV light. In order to confirm the results obtained using the above assay, an alternative approach was employed in which aliquots of TILJneo, TILJhCD44H, and TILJhCD44Rl cells were labeled with red (PKH26) or green (PKH2) fluorescent cell linkers (Sigma) as per the manufacturer's instructions. Both linkers are aliphatic molecules that stably integrate into cell membrane by selective partitioning. After washing three times in DME + 10% FCI at room temperature, cells were resuspended in PBS and equal numbers (5 × 106) of PKH2-labeled (green) and PKH26-labeled (red) cells were mixed together, agitated on a shaker for 15 min, and cellular aggregation (i.e. the number of green and red double stained events) determined by analyzing the samples on a FACSort (Becton Dickinson). COS7 cells were transfected with the plasmid pCDM8.CD44cl2.3 encoding CD44R1 as described previously (27Dougherty G.J. Cooper D.L. Memory J.F. Chiu R.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9074-9078Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). 48 h later the transfected cells were harvested and 5 × 104 added to each well of a 24-well plate. Following overnight incubation, the medium was removed and 5 × 105 Jneo-, JhCD44H-, or JhCD44Rl-transduced TIL1 cells in a final volume of 0.5 ml were added to each well. The plates were incubated at room temperature for 15 min and any nonadherent cells removed by washing 3 times with PBS. Adherent cell monolayers were then fixed in methanol for 5 min at room temperature, air dried, and stained for CD44 expression using mAb 8d8 as described previously (12Dougherty G.J. Lansdorp P.M. Cooper D.L. Humphries R. K J. Exp. Med. 1991; 174: 1-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). The percentage of CD44-positive COS7 cells binding 3 or more TIL1 cells was determined by counting on an inverted phase microscope. All experiments were repeated at least three times. Where appropriate mean, S.E. and p values (Student's t test) were calculated using the InStat Biostatistics Program (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA). As shown in Fig. 1, TIL cells transduced with either JhCD44H or JhCD44Rl expressed high, and approximately equal levels of CD44 as determined by reactivity with mAb 3G12. As expected, only TILJhCD44Rl cells reacted with the CD44 exon v10-specific mAb 2G1, while TILJneo cells were unreactive with both mAb 3G12 and 2G1. All three cell lines were unreactive with mAb TIB240 directed against murine CD44 (data not shown). Western blot analysis confirmed that the CD44 species expressed by TILJhCD44H and TILJhCD44R1 cells were appropriately processed and similar in size to the CD44H and CD44R1 molecules present on phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate-stimulated K562 cells (Fig. 2). No species reactive with mAb 3G12 were detected in unstimulated K562 cells or TILJneo cells (Fig. 2). Similarly, no species were detected in any lane when blots were probed with the isotype matched control mAb TIB 191 (ATCC) directed against the hapten TNP (data not shown).FIG. 2Western blot analysis of CD44 expression on TILJneo, TILJhCD44H, and TILJhCD44R1 cells. Approximately 2 × 105 cell equivalents were run in each lane of a 5% SDS-PAGE gel, transferred to nitrocellulose, and probed with mAb 3G12 followed by a peroxidase-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse IgG second antibody. The reaction was developed in PBS containing 0.06% (w/v) 3–3′-diaminobenzidine and 0.012% (v/v) hydrogen peroxide.

While CD44-ve TILJneo cells almost completely lacked hyaluronan binding activity, TILJhCD44H and TILJhCD44R1 bound avidly to plastic surfaces coated with hyaluronan (Fig. 3). This adhesion was mediated by CD44 and could be inhibited by some, but not all, mAbs directed against this molecule. All CD44 mAbs that blocked the adhesion of TILJhCD44H cells to hyaluronan also blocked the binding of TILJhCD44R1 cells. In addition, some partial inhibition of TILJhCD44R1 binding to hyaluronan was obtained with the CD44 exon v10-specific mAb 2G1. This mAb, of course, had no effect on the adhesion of TILJhCD44H cells. None of the mAbs tested had any effect on the binding of TILJneo cells to hyaluronan. Transduced TIL1 cells were also tested for their ability to bind soluble hyaluronan. As shown in Fig. 4, both CD44H- and CD44R1-transduced cells were able to bind FITC-HA and did so to a similar extent. Little or no binding of FITC-HA to TILJneo cells was evident. Taken together, these data confirm that CD44H and CD44R1 are both able to bind immobilized and soluble hyaluronan when expressed in TIL1 cells. As shown in Fig. 5, while TILJneo and TILJhCD44H cells remain largely monodisperse when incubated in PBS, TILJhCD44R1 cells spontaneously form large homotypic aggregates. Similar results were obtained using an alternative approach in which equal numbers of red or green fluorescently labeled TILJneo, TILJhCD44H, or TILJhCD44R1 cells were mixed together and aggregates identified on the FACS by virtue of their co-expression of both labels (Fig. 6). Since both TILJhCD44H and TILJhCD44R1 cells can bind immobilized and soluble hyaluronan, it is unlikely that the homotypic aggregation of TILJhCD44R1 cells involves the recognition of hyaluronan on the surface of interacting cells. In support of this conclusion, rather than inhibiting aggregation of TILJhCD44R1 cells, the hyaluronan adhesion-blocking mAbs 4A4 and 3G12 appeared to potentiate it (Fig. 5). This enhanced aggregation did not seem to involve the simple cross-linking of CD44 molecules on adjacent cells, as neither of these two mAbs induced the aggregation of TILJhCD44H cells. Taken together with the results presented above, these data strongly suggest that CD44R1 promotes the homotypic aggregation of transduced TIL1 cells by recognizing and binding a ligand present on the surface of adjacent cells that is distinct from hyaluronan.FIG. 6Homotypic aggregation of TILJneo, TILJhCD44H, and TILJhCD44R1 cells. Transduced TIL1 cells were labeled with red or green fluorescent cell linkers washed three times in DME + 10% FCI at room temperature, resuspended in PBS, and equal numbers (5 × 105) of red- and green-labeled cells were mixed together, agitated on a shaker for 15 min, and analyzed on the FACS.

The cellular aggregates that formed were examined for the presence of both fluorescently labeled and unlabeled cells. As shown in Fig. 7, the aggregates that formed when TILJneo and TILJhCD44R1 cells were mixed contained only fluorescently labeled TILJhCD44R1 cells. These data indicate that CD44R1 does not promote the cellular aggregation of TILJhCD44R1 cells by recognizing and binding a ligand that is also present on the surface of control TILJneo cells. Interestingly, when TILJhCD44R1 cells were mixed with TILJhCD44H cells, the cellular aggregates that formed contained both labeled TILJhCD44R1 cells and a small number of unlabeled TILJhCD44H cells. This finding strongly suggests that CD44R1 can recognize and bind CD44H. This conclusion is supported by the FACS data shown in Fig. 6D, in which small numbers of double labeled aggregates appear to be produced when equal numbers of PKH26 (red) labeled TILJhCD44R1 and PKH2 (green) labeled TILJhCD44H cells were mixed together. Finally, when Calcein-labeled and unlabeled TILJhCD44R1 cells were mixed, the aggregates that formed contained approximately equal numbers of labeled and unlabeled cells (Fig. 7), confirming that CD44R1 molecules can also bind to one another. To further confirm these results and to more easily quantitate the interaction between the various CD44 isoforms, TILJhCD44H and TILJhCD44R1 cells were also tested for their ability to adhere to COS7 cells transiently transfected with the CD44R1 cDNA. As shown in Table I, CD44H- and CD44R1-transduced, but not control Jneo-transduced cells were able to bind to transfected CD44R1-positive COS7 cells. Moreover, in agreement with the cellular aggregation data presented in FIG. 6, FIG. 7, a significantly higher proportion (p < 0.05) of CD44R1-positive COS7 cells bound TILJhCD44R1 cells than bound TILJhCD44H cells.Table IBinding of transduced TIL1 cells to CD44R1 transfected COS7 cellsCD44R1+ve COS7 cells binding TIL1%TILJneo<1TILJhCD44H27.6 ± 5.53TILJhCD44R144.5 ± 0.7 Open table in a new tab Although the widely distributed cell surface glycoprotein CD44 has been shown to function as a receptor for the glycosaminoglycan hyaluronan (5Aruffo A.

Kincade P.W. J. Exp. Med. 1990; 171: 477-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (530) Google Scholar), there is increasing evidence that not all CD44-dependent cellular adhesion events involve recognition of this particular ligand. For example, while the anti-CD44 mAb Hermes-3 can block lymphocyte attachment to high endothelial venules in frozen sections of human mucosal lymphoid tissues (28Jalkanen S.T. Bargatze R.F. de los Toyos J. Butcher E.C. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 983-990Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar), this same antibody had no effect on the hyaluronan-dependent binding of a B-cell line transfected with human CD44 to cultured rat endothelial cells (14Stamenkovic I. Aruffo A. Seed B. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 343-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar), nor did it inhibit the binding of [3H]hyaluronan to detergent extracts of human CD44-positive cells (7Culty M. Miyake K. Kincade P.W. Silorski E. Butcher E.C. Underhill C. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 2765-2774Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). These data are consistent with the observation that the epitope recognized by mAb Hermes-3 maps to a region of the CD44 molecule close to the membrane spanning domain (29Goldstein L.A. Zhou D.F.H. Picker L.J. Minty C.N. Bargatze R.F. Ding J.F. Butcher E.C. Cell. 1989; 56: 1063-1072Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar) and some distance from the amino-terminal region implicated in hyaluronan binding (30Peach R.J. Hollenbaugh D. Stamenkovic I. Aruffo A. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 257-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). Taken together these findings suggest strongly that CD44 can recognize and bind a ligand present on endothelial cells that is distinct from hyaluronan. Moreover, since mAb Hermes-3 had little or no effect on the CD44-dependent binding of lymphocytes to endothelial cells in sections of synovial and peripheral tissues (28Jalkanen S.T. Bargatze R.F. de los Toyos J. Butcher E.C. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 983-990Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar) it appears that this putative ligand is differentially expressed on endothelial cells in different tissues. At present the molecular nature of this alternative CD44 ligand(s) remains undefined. Recently, it has become clear that alternative splicing events can generate a large number of differentially expressed CD44 isoforms that contain additional peptide sequences of varying length inserted into a single site within the extracellular domain of the molecule proximal to the membrane spanning domain (15Jackson D.G. Buckley J. Bell J.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 4732-4739Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Screaton G.R. Bell M.V. Jackson D.G. Cornelis F.B. Gerth U. Bell J.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.

At present, however, the effect of such inserted regions on the ligand-binding specificity of the CD44 molecule remains unclear. We have shown previously (27Dougherty G.J. Cooper D.L. Memory J.F. Chiu R.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9074-9078Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and have confirmed in this study, that CD44R1, the major alternatively spliced CD44 isoform expressed by various transformed hemopoietic and non-hemopoietic cell types (12Dougherty G.J. Lansdorp P.M. Cooper D.L. Humphries R. K J. Exp. Med. 1991; 174: 1-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar), retains the ability to recognize and bind immobilized hyaluronan. Moreover, although the CD44 molecules expressed by certain cell types have been reported to differ in their ability to bind immobilized versus soluble hyaluronan (4Lesley J. Hyman R. Kincade P.W. Adv. Immunol. 1993; 54: 271-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (1025) Google Scholar), both CD44H and CD44R1 also appeared equally capable of binding this latter ligand when expressed in the CD44-negative murine T-cell lymphoma cell line TIL1. There are, however, differences in the ligand-binding specificity of these two molecules. In particular, expression of CD44R1, but not CD44H, caused transduced TIL1 cells to homotypically aggregate. Cell mixing experiments indicated further that JhCD44R1 transduced TIL1 cells could also aggregate with CD44H-transduced cells, but not control TILJneo cells, suggesting that CD44R1 can recognize and bind a common determinant present on both CD44H and CD44R1. Since a significantly higher percentage of COS7 cells transfected with CD44R1 bound TILJhCD44R1 cells than bound TILJhCD44H cells, it would seem that the reciprocal interaction between two CD44R1 molecules is of a higher affinity and/or avidity than the interaction between CD44H and CD44R1. In a previous study, St. John et al. (31St. John T. Meyer J. Idzerda R.L. Gallatin W.M. Cell. 1990; 60: 45-52Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) demonstrated that murine L cells transfected with the baboon CD44H cDNA exhibited a new adhesive phenotype characterized by the formation of large cell aggregates. In this instance, however, CD44H transfected cells were also able to aggregate with nontransfected parental cells. Moreover, such aggregation could be readily inhibited by mAbs directed against the hyaluronan-binding domain of the CD44 molecule. Since many fibroblastoid cell lines produce hyaluronan and are surrounded by hyaluronidase-sensitive cell coats (32McBride W.H. Bard J.B.L. J. Exp. Med. 1979; 149: 507-515Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 33Bard J.B.L. McBride W.H. Ross A.R. J. Cell Sci. 1983; 62: 371-383Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 34Laurent T. Fraser J. FASEB J. 1992; 6: 2397-2404Crossref PubMed Scopus (2041) Google Scholar), it is likely that the aggregation noted in this study involved the interaction between the transfected CD44 molecules and hyaluronan on the surface of opposing cells. In contrast, as both CD44H and CD44R1 can bind hyaluronan, but only CD44R1 promotes the homotypic aggregation of transduced TIL1 cells, it is unlikely that the aggregation response observed in the present study involves the recognition of hyaluronan. Indeed lymphoid cells appear to produce little if any hyaluronan (34Laurent T. Fraser J. FASEB J. 1992; 6: 2397-2404Crossref PubMed Scopus (2041) Google Scholar). Moreover, treatment of CD44R1-transduced TIL1 cells with either mAbs that block cellular attachment to hyaluronan (Fig. 5) or with Type × leech hyaluronidase (Sigma), an enzyme that specifically cleaves the β-glucuronate-(1Haynes B.F.

Dougherty, manuscript in preparation. had little or no effect on the aggregation of these cells. The molecular nature of the determinant present on CD44R1 recognized by other CD44R1 molecules and by CD44H remains to be determined. In addition to binding hyaluronan, CD44H has also been reported to recognize and bind chondroitin-4-sulfate (30Peach R.J. Hollenbaugh D. Stamenkovic I. Aruffo A. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 257-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar, 35Naujokas M.F. Morin M. Anderson M.S. Peterson M. Miller J. Cell. 1993; 74: 257-268Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Indeed, Toyama-Sorimachi and Miyasaka (36Toyama-Sorimachi N. Miyasaka M. Int. Immunol. 1994; 6: 655-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) have recently demonstrated that murine CTLL-2 cells express a high molecular weight (gp600) molecule extensively modified by chondroitin sulfate side chains that can be recognized and bound by CD44H. However, since TIL1 cells transfected with CD44H do not homotypically aggregate or bind control Jneo transduced TIL1 cells it must be assumed that this particular ligand is not present on the TIL1 cell line. Recently we have found that CD44R2, an alternatively spliced CD44 isoform containing only exon v10 (12Dougherty G.J. Lansdorp P.M. Cooper D.L. Humphries R. K J. Exp. Med. 1991; 174: 1-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar), also promotes cellular adhesion,4 indicating that the functionally important determinant present within CD44R1 is encoded by exon v10. Although exon v10 contains a potential site of chondroitin sulfate attachment (12Dougherty G.J. Lansdorp P.M. Cooper D.L. Humphries R. K J. Exp. Med. 1991; 174: 1-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar), there is no evidence based on the apparent molecular mass of the molecule on SDS-PAGE, that a significant proportion of CD44R1 molecules expressed by TILJhCD44R1 cells are modified in this way. It should be noted, however, that an alternative possibility, not excluded by the studies reported in this article, is that the expression of CD44R1 may switch on a second gene product which may in turn serve as a ligand for CD44R1 and/or CD44H. Recently, we have demonstrated that while resting T cells are CD44R1-negative, stimulation with the mitogen phytohemagglutinin or with a combination of OKT3 and phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate, dramatically up-regulated expression of the CD44R1 isoform without significantly altering the total level of CD44 expressed by these cells.3 CD44R1 also appears to be expressed by transformed endothelial cell lines and by non-transformed vascular endothelial cells stimulated with tumor necrosis factor-α. 5J. F. Dirks and G. J. Dougherty, unpublished observation. Thus the differential expression of alternatively spliced CD44 isoforms on activated lymphocytes and endothelial cells may help regulate the adhesive interaction between these two cell types under both steady state conditions and in response to inflammatory stimuli. Alternatively spliced CD44 isoforms are also differentially expressed on various malignant cell types (37Matsumura Y. Tarin D. Lancet. 1992; 340: 1053-1058Abstract PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar, 38Tanabe K.K. Ellis L.M. Saya H. Lancet. 1993; 341: 725-726Abstract PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar) and the adhesive interaction between these molecules and CD44 proteins present on endothelial cells and/or various immune cell types may help explain the suggested involvement of CD44 tumor metastasis."

To evaluate potential regulatory roles of the 5′-untranslated region (UTR) in the human inducible nitric oxide synthase gene, the transcription initiation sites and structure of the 5′-UTR of human inducible nitric oxide synthase were examined. Freshly isolated human alveolar macrophages, bronchial epithelial cells, and several types of cultured cells were evaluated following stimulation with cytokines (i.e. interferon-, interleukin-1β, tumor necrosis factor-α, and interleukin-6). The mRNA was analyzed by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, Northern analysis, and 5′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends. Despite the presence of a TATA box in the promoter region, multiple transcription initiation sites were observed, some extending several hundred base pairs upstream from the main TATA-directed initiation site. Alternative splicing in the 5′-UTR of human inducible nitric oxide synthase mRNA resulted in further diversity. The TATA-independent inducible nitric oxide synthase mRNA transcripts were up-regulated by cytokines. The long and complex 5′-UTRs contain eight partially overlapping open reading frames upstream of the putative inducible nitric oxide synthase ATG, which may have an important role in translational regulation of human inducible nitric oxide synthase mRNA."

We postulated that skeletal growth factors with potent mitogenic activity not only decrease skeletal IGFs I and II synthesis but may have analogous effects on IGFBP-5 expression, and these changes are relevant to the growth and differentiated function of the osteoblast. The present studies were undertaken to examine the effects of basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), transforming growth factor β1 (TGF β1), and platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) BB on IGFBP-5 synthesis in cultures of osteoblast-enriched cells from fetal rat parietal bone (Ob cells) and to determine possible mechanisms involved. The culture method used was described in detail previously (16McCarthy T.L. Centrella M. Canalis E. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 15353-15356Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Parietal bones were obtained from 22-day-old fetal rats immediately after the mothers were sacrificed by blunt trauma to the nuchal area. This project was approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Saint Francis Hospital and Medical Center. Cells were obtained by five sequential digestions of the parietal bone using bacterial collagenase (CLS II, Worthington). Cell populations harvested from the third to the fifth digestions were cultured as a pool and were previously shown to have osteoblastic characteristics (19McCarthy T.L. Centrella M. Canalis E. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1988; 3: 401-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Ob cells were plated at a density of 8,000-12,000 cells/cm2 and cultured in a humidified 5% CO2 incubator at 37°C until reaching confluence (about 50,000 cells/cm2). Cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with nonessential amino acids, 100 μg/ml L-ascorbic acid, penicillin, streptomycin, and 20 mM HEPES (all from Life Technologies, Inc.), and 10% fetal bovine serum (HyClone, Logan, UT). At confluence the cells were rinsed and transferred to serum-free medium for 20-24 h, when they were again rinsed with serum-free medium, and then exposed to test or control medium in the absence of serum for 2-48 h. The medium of cultures lasting 48 h was replaced with fresh solutions after 24 h. Cycloheximide, hydroxyurea (both from Sigma), and recombinant human PDGF BB (Austral, San Ramon, CA) were added directly to the culture medium. Basic FGF (Austral) was dissolved in 20 mM sodium citrate and diluted 1:5,000 or greater in culture medium, and recombinant human TGF β1 (Austral and a gift from Genentech, South San Francisco, CA) was either added directly to the medium or dissolved in 5 mM HCl and diluted 1:3,000 or greater in DMEM. 5,6-dichlorobenzimidazole (DRB) (Sigma) was dissolved in absolute ethanol and diluted 1:200 in DMEM; in experiments where DRB was used, all experimental groups were exposed to an equal amount of ethanol. For the nuclear run on experiment, subconfluent cultures of Ob cells were trypsinized, subcultured at a 1:6 dilution, and grown to confluence in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Cells were serum-deprived for 24 h and treated for 2-24 h in serum-free DMEM. For RNA analysis, the cell layer was extracted with guanidine thiocyanate at the end of the incubation and stored at −80°C. For protein analysis, the conditioned medium was obtained, the extracellular matrix was extracted, and both were processed for Western blots. For the nuclear run on assay, nuclei were isolated by Dounce homogenization. Total cellular RNA was isolated with guanidine thiocyanate, at acid pH, followed by phenol-chloroform (Sigma) extraction (20Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63232) Google Scholar). RNA was precipitated with isopropyl alcohol, resuspended, and reprecipitated with ethanol. The RNA recovered was quantitated by spectrometry, and equal amounts of RNA from control or test samples were loaded on a formaldehyde-agarose gel following denaturation. RNA standards (BDH Ltd., Poole, U. K.) were used to determine transcript size. The gel was stained with ethidium bromide to visualize RNA standards and ribosomal RNA, documenting equal RNA loading of the various experimental samples. The RNA was then blotted onto Gene Screen Plus charged nylon (DuPont). A 300-base pair HindIII restriction fragment of the rat IGFBP-5 cDNA (kindly provided by Dr. S.

IGFBP-5 cDNA was labeled with [α-32P]dCTP and [α-32P]dATP (50 μCi of each at a specific activity of 3,000 Ci/mmol; (DuPont) using the random hexanucleotide-primed second strand synthesis method (22Feinberg A.P. Vogelstein B. Anal. Biochem. 1984; 137: 266-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (5190) Google Scholar). Hybridizations were carried out at 42°C for 16-72 h, and post-hybridization washes were performed at 65°C in 0.1 × saline-sodium citrate. The bound radioactive material was visualized by autoradiography on Kodak X-AR5 film, employing Cronex Lightning Plus intensifying screens (DuPont). Relative hybridization levels were determined by densitometry. Northern analyses shown are representative of three or more cultures. To examine changes in hnRNA, rat IGFBP-5 intron 2-specific primers were designed following partial sequence analysis of intron 2. For this purpose, intron 2 of IGFBP-5 was amplified from rat genomic DNA (Promega, Madison, WI), using the sense exon 2 primer 5’-GACTCTCGGGAGCATGAGGAAC-3’ and the antisense exon 3 primer 5’-AGCTTCCATGTGTCTGCGGCAG-3’, by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using Taq DNA polymerase in accordance with manufacturer's instructions (Perkin Elmer). The PCR amplification was performed for 30 cycles of 94°C for 1 min, 65°C for 1 min, and 72°C for 1 min. A single PCR product of approximately 780 base pairs was purified by agarose gel electrophoresis and subcloned into pCRTM II (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA), and its identity was confirmed by partial DNA sequence analysis. To determine changes in hnRNA, total RNA from control and test samples was prepared as described for Northern analysis. One μg of RNA was treated with DNase and reverse-transcribed in the presence of the rat IGFBP-5 intron 2-specific antisense primer 5’-CTTAGGATGCACGTGGTT-3’ at 42°C for 30 min with Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies, Inc.) The newly transcribed cDNA was amplified by 25 PCR cycles of 94°C for 1 min, 56°C for 1 min, and 72°C for 1 min, following the addition of the IGFBP-5 intron 2-specific sense primer 5’-GCACCATCCCAATCTGAT-3’, Taq DNA polymerase, and 5 μCi of [α-32P]dCTP (3,000 Ci/mmol, DuPont) as described (23Lipson K.E.

Chem. 1993; 268: 7196-7204Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The PCR products were fractionated by electrophoresis on a 6% urea-polyacrylamide denaturing gel, visualized by autoradiography, and quantitated by densitometry. An internal DNA standard was included in the PCR and used to correct for variations in amplification. The standard was obtained by amplification of SV40 promoter sequences in the pGL2-P plasmid DNA using the composite sense primer 5’-GCACCATCCCAATCTGATattagtcagcaaccatagtc-3’, and antisense primer 5’-CTTAGGATGCACGTGGTTggttccatcctctagaggat-3’. The capital letters indicate IGFBP-5 intron 2 sequences, while the lowercase letters represent pGL2-P vector sequences. To examine changes in the rate of transcription, nuclei were isolated by Dounce homogenization in a Tris buffer containing 0.5% Nonidet P-40. Nascent transcripts were labeled by incubation of nuclei in a reaction buffer containing 500 μM each of ATP, CTP, and guanidine triphosphate, 150 units of RNAsin (Promega), and 250 μCi of [32P]UTP (3,000 Ci/mmol, DuPont) (25Greenberg M.E. Ziff E.B. Nature. 1984; 311: 433-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (2009) Google Scholar). RNA was isolated by treatment with DNase I and proteinase K, followed by phenol-chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation. Linearized plasmid DNA containing about 1 μg of cDNA was immobilized onto GeneScreen Plus by slot blotting according to the manufacturer's directions (DuPont). The plasmid vector pGL2-Basic (Promega) was used as a control for nonspecific hybridization, and a mouse 18 S cDNA clone (ATCC, Rockville, MD) was used to estimate loading of the gel. Equal counts/min of [32P]RNA from each sample were hybridized to cDNAs using the same conditions as for Northern blot analysis and were visualized by autoradiography. Extracellular matrix was prepared as described (26Knudsen B.S. Harpel P.C. Nachman R.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1988; 80: 1082-1088Crossref Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 27Jones J.I. Gockerman A. Busby Jr., W.H. Camacho-Hubner C. Clemmons D.R. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 679-687Crossref PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar). Briefly, Ob cells were rinsed in phosphate-buffered saline, cell membranes were removed with 0.5% Triton X-100 (Sigma), pH 7.4, and nuclei and cytoskeleton were removed by incubation with 25 mM ammonium acetate, pH 9.0, for 5 min. The extracellular matrix was rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline and scraped from the culture plates. Aliquots from the conditioned medium or the extracellular matrix were fractionated by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis on 10-18% denaturing gradient gels (28Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar). For Western immunoblots, proteins were transferred to Immobilon P membranes (Millipore, Bedford, MA), blocked with 2% bovine serum albumin, and exposed to a 1:500 dilution of rabbit antisera raised against native human IGFBP-5 (UBI, Lake Placid, NY), in 1% bovine serum albumin overnight. Blots were exposed to goat anti-rabbit IgG antisera conjugated to horseradish peroxidase, washed, and developed with a horseradish peroxidase chemiluminescence detection reagent (DuPont). For Western ligand blots, transferred proteins were incubated with 125I-IGF II, and the blot was developed by autoradiography as described (29Hossenlopp P. Seurin D. Segovia-Quinson B. Hardouin S. Binoux M. Anal. Biochem. 1986; 154: 138-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (1199) Google Scholar). IGFBP-5 was identified by co-migration with recombinant human IGFBP-5 (Austral). Northern blot analysis of total RNA extracted from confluent cultures of Ob cells revealed a predominant IGFBP-5 transcript of 6.0 kilobases, although in accordance with observations in other cell systems, smaller size transcripts were also detected (30Conover C.A.

Continuous treatment of Ob cells with bFGF, TGF β1, and PDGF BB caused a time-dependent decrease in IGFBP-5 steady state mRNA levels. Treatment of Ob cells with bFGF at 6 nM for 6 h caused no change in IGFBP-5 mRNA, whereas TGF β1 at 0.4 nM and PDGF BB at 3.3 nM for 6 h caused a slight decrease in IGFBP-5 transcripts (Fig. 1). After 24 h of treatment with bFGF, TGF β1, and PDGF BB at the indicated doses, densitometric analysis revealed a 75% or greater decrease in IGFBP-5 mRNA, and the inhibition was sustained for 48 h. Because the growth factors tested increase β-actin and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase mRNA, IGFBP-5 mRNA levels were not corrected for changes in β-actin or glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase mRNA, and uniformity of RNA loading of the gels was estimated by ethidium bromide staining of ribosomal RNA (9Canalis E. Pash J. Gabbitas B. Rydziel S. Varghese S. Endocrinology. 1993; 133: 33-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar).2( 2E. Canalis, unpublished observations. ) Continuous treatment of Ob cells with bFGF, TGF β1, and PDGF BB for 48 h caused a dose-dependent inhibition of IGFBP-5 transcript levels (Fig. 2). Densitometric analysis revealed that bFGF at 6 nM and PDGF BB at 3.3 nM decreased IGFBP-5 mRNA by 70% and that TGF β1 at 1.2 nM decreased IGFBP-5 transcripts to virtually undetectable levels.Figure 2:Effect of bFGF, transforming growth factor β1 (TGFβ), and PDGF BB, in nanomolar concentrations, on IGFBP-5 mRNA expression in cultures of Ob cells treated for 48 h.

Western immunoblots confirmed the presence of a major form of immunoreactive IGFBP-5 of 31 kDa and two minor forms in the 29-30-kDa range (Fig. 3 B). These probably represent different degrees of IGFBP-5 glycosylation (18Conover C.A. Bale L.K. Clarkson J.T. Torring O. Endocrinology. 1993; 132: 2525-2530Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 30Conover C.A. Kiefer M.C. J. Clin. Endocrinol. & Metab. 1993; 76: 1153-1159Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). bFGF at 6 nM, TGF β1 at 1.2 nM, and PDGF BB at 3.3 nM for 24 h decreased the 31-kDa form of IGFBP-5 as determined by Western ligand and immunoblots (Fig. 3, A and B). The Western immunoblot revealed immunoreactive protein bands of 45-50 kDa, which increased with TGF β1 and PDGF BB treatment. These proteins were not detected in the Western ligand blot shown in Fig. 3A. Stripping of the immunoblot shown and incubation with 125I-IGF II as ligand visualized IGFBP-5 but not the 45-50-kDa proteins, confirming that they were not IGFBPs (not shown). The levels of IGFBP-5 in the culture medium were low, making the detection of an inhibitory effect impractical (not shown). To determine whether or not the effects observed on IGFBP-5 mRNA levels were dependent on protein synthesis, serum-deprived confluent cultures of Ob cells were treated with the various growth factors in the presence or absence of cycloheximide at 3.6 μM. In earlier experiments cycloheximide at doses of 2 μM and higher was found to inhibit protein synthesis in Ob cell cultures by 80-85% (34Centrella M. McCarthy T.L. Canalis E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 4490-4496Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Northern blot analysis revealed that treatment with cycloheximide for 24-48 h caused a comparable and marked decrease in IGFBP-5 transcript levels so that further inhibitory effects of bFGF, TGF β1, and PDGF BB could not be detected (Fig. 4). To determine if the changes in IGFBP-5 mRNA levels observed were related to the mitogenic activity of the growth factors studied, serum-deprived Ob cell cultures were treated with the various factors in the presence or absence of hydroxyurea at 1 mM, a dose previously shown to block DNA synthesis in Ob cells (35Centrella M. McCarthy T.L. Kusmik W.F. Canalis E. J. Cell. Physiol. 1991; 147: 420-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Northern blot analysis revealed that treatment with hydroxyurea for 48 h did not modify IGFBP-5 transcripts and did not prevent the inhibitory effect of bFGF, TGF β1, or PDGF BB (Fig. 5).Figure 5:Effect of basic fibroblast growth factor (FG) at 6 nM, transforming growth factor β1 (Tβ) at 1.2 nM, and platelet-derived growth factor (BB) at 3.3 nM in the presence (+) or absence (-) of hydroxyurea at 1 mM on IGFBP-5 mRNA expression in cultures of Ob cells treated for 48 h. Total RNA from control (C) or treated cultures was subjected to Northern blot analysis and hybridized with a 32P-labeled rat IGFBP-5 cDNA.

Bunick D. Ackerman S. Mittleman B. Weinmann R. J. Mol. Biol. 1983; 167: 561-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The half-life of IGFBP-5 mRNA in transcriptionally arrested Ob cells was estimated at 20 h, and it was not changed by treatment with any of the growth factors tested (Fig. 6). Treatment of Ob cells with bFGF at 6 nM, TGF β1 at 1.2 nM, and PDGF BB at 3.3 nM for 2, 6, or 24 h decreased IGFBP-5 hnRNA expression as estimated by reverse transcription PCR (Fig. 7). This would suggest a change in RNA transcription or processing. After 2 and 6 h of treatment, bFGF and TGF β1 decreased IGFBP-5 hnRNA by at least 90% as determined by densitometry, whereas PDGF BB inhibited IGFBP-5 hnRNA by 30-50%. The inhibitory effect of PDGF BB on hnRNA was not observed after 24 h of treatment, whereas bFGF and TGF β1 were effective for up to 24 h. The growth factors tested did not change the signal of the internal standard, indicating uniform PCR. Furthermore, no signal of the hnRNA product was detected in any of the samples tested when the reverse transcription step was omitted prior to the PCR, eliminating the possibility of DNA contamination. To confirm whether the growth factors tested modified the transcription of the IGFBP-5 gene, nuclear run on assays were performed on nuclei from Ob cells treated for 2-24 h. bFGF at 6 nM, TGF β1 at 1.2 nM, and PDGF BB at 3.3 nM inhibited the rate of IGFBP-5 transcription after 14 h by 20-60% and after 24 h by 70-80% (Fig. 8). The factors were not effective after 2 h, and after 6 h of treatment only a modest decrease in the rate of IGFBP-5 transcription was observed (not shown).Figure 7:Effect of basic fibroblast growth factor (FG) at 6 nM, transforming growth factor β1 (Tβ) at 1.2 nM, and platelet-derived growth factor (BB) at 3.3 nM on heterogeneous nuclear RNA expression in cultures of Ob cells treated for 2, 6, or 24 h. Total RNA from control (C) or treated cultures was extracted, and 1 μg was subjected to competitive reverse transcription-PCR in the presence of IGFBP-5 intron 2-specific 5’-sense and 3’-antisense primers and of 5 μCi of [α-32P]dCTP. The reverse transcriptase-PCR products were fractionated by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and visualized by autoradiography.

Nascent transcripts were labeled in vitro with [32P]UTP, and the labeled RNA was hybridized to immobilized cDNA for IGFBP-5.

The present investigation was undertaken to determine whether growth factors known to be synthesized by skeletal cells modify IGFBP-5 expression in calvarial derived Ob cells. We demonstrated that bFGF, TGF β1, and PDGF BB decrease IGFBP-5 mRNA levels in Ob cells in a time- and dose-dependent manner and that de novo protein synthesis is required for basal IGFBP-5 transcript expression. The growth factors tested are known to stimulate bone cell replication, but the decrease in IGFBP-5 synthesis in Ob cells was not modified by the DNA synthesis inhibitor hydroxyurea, suggesting that this effect was independent from their mitogenic activity. Experiments in transcriptionally blocked Ob cells, using the RNA polymerase II inhibitor DRB, revealed that bFGF, TGF β1, and PDGF BB did not modify IGFBP-5 mRNA stability. This, in conjunction with a decrease in hnRNA levels and in the rate of IGFBP-5 gene transcription caused by the three growth factors studied, suggests that bFGF, TGF β1, and PDGF BB inhibit IGFBP-5 expression at the level of RNA transcription. Our studies revealed that changes in the rate of IGFBP-5 transcription were delayed and somewhat less intense than those in hnRNA. This could be due to technical differences. However, since changes in hnRNA levels may be due to effects on transcription or RNA processing, it is possible that the growth factors studied had an early effect on RNA processing in addition to their effects on IGFBP-5 transcription. Intact IGFBP-5 is primarily present in the extracellular matrix of skeletal and nonskeletal cells (27Jones J.I. Gockerman A. Busby Jr., W.H. Camacho-Hubner C. Clemmons D.R. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 679-687Crossref PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar), 3E. Canalis and B. Gabbitas, unpublished observations. and the three growth factors studied decreased IGFBP-5 in this compartment. PDGF BB and TGF β1 also increased proteins migrating with a Mr of 45,000-50,000. The nature of the protein reacting with the IGFBP-5 antibody is presently unknown. However, this protein(s) does not appear to be an IGFBP since it did not bind radiolabeled IGF II. The amount of IGFBP-5 secreted to the culture medium of Ob cells under the described culture conditions is small, and peptide degradation occurs, so inhibitory changes are difficult to detect. Modifications in IGFBP-5 protease levels or activity is another level of regulation by which skeletal growth factors may modify IGFBP-5 polypeptide in bone cells (37Kanzaki S. Hilliker S. Baylink D.J. Mohan S. Endocrinology. 1994; 134: 383-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 38Thrailkill K. Quarles L. Nigase H. Suzuki K. Serra D. Fowlkes J. Proceedings of the 76th Annual Meeting of the Endocrine Society. Anaheim, CA1994: 438Google Scholar). It was recently shown that matrix metalloproteinase I or interstitial collagenase degrades IGFBP-5, and bFGF, TGF β1, and PDGF BB regulate interstitial collagenase synthesis in skeletal and nonskeletal cells (38Thrailkill K. Quarles L. Nigase H. Suzuki K. Serra D. Fowlkes J. Proceedings of the 76th Annual Meeting of the Endocrine Society. Anaheim, CA1994: 438Google Scholar, 39Matrisian L.M. Hogan B.L.M. Curr. Top. Dev. Biol. 1990; 24: 219-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). 4S. Varghese and E. Canalis, unpublished observations. This would suggest that the growth factors studied have the capability of regulating IGFBP-5 by transcriptional and post-translational mechanisms. While there are uncertainties about the physiological concentrations of bFGF, TGF β1, and PDGF BB in bone cultures, their effects on IGFBP-5 synthesis were observed at doses that modify other parameters of metabolic function in Ob cells and doses that are known to inhibit IGF I and II synthesis in bone (8Canalis E. Pash J. Varghese S. Crit. Rev. Eukaryotic Gene Expression. 1993; 3: 155-166PubMed Google Scholar, 9Canalis E. Pash J. Gabbitas B. Rydziel S. Varghese S. Endocrinology. 1993; 133: 33-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 10Gabbitas B. Pash J. Canalis E. Endocrinology. 1994; 135: 284-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). This suggests that the inhibition of IGFBP-5 synthesis may be physiologically relevant. A decrease in IGFs I and II as well as IGFBP-5 synthesis might mediate selected effects of growth factors on bone cell function. Recently, it was shown that bFGF and PDGF BB increase the synthesis of skeletal IGFBP-4, a binding protein with inhibitory properties in bone (5Chen T.L. Chang L.L. DiGregorio D.A. Perlman A.J. Huang Y-F. Endocrinology. 1993; 133: 1382-1389Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This effect as well as an inhibition of IGFBP-5, IGF I, and IGF II synthesis may be relevant to the actions of selected growth factors on bone cell function. On the other hand, bFGF, TGF β1, and PDGF BB have complex effects in bone, and it is likely that they have a number of actions on bone metabolism, which are independent of their effects on the IGF-IGFBP axis (8Canalis E. Pash J. Varghese S. Crit. Rev. Eukaryotic Gene Expression. 1993; 3: 155-166PubMed Google Scholar). IGFBP-5 has significant effects on bone cell growth, and its expression is coordinated with stages of osteoblast cell growth. In addition, its expression in myoblasts is correlated with cell differentiation and, as in bone cells, it is inhibited by growth factors with mitogenic properties (40Rechler M.M. Vitam. Horm. 1993; 47: 1-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar, 41McCusker R.H. Clemmons D.R. Endocrinology. 1994; 134: 2095-2102Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). These observations suggest a coordinated expression of IGFBP-5 in bone and muscle and a possible relevance to the expression of the differentiated phenotype in the musculoskeletal system. In fact, bFGF, PDGF BB, and (to a somewhat more variable extent) TGF β1 have been shown to inhibit the differentiated expression of the osteoblastic phenotype, and they also inhibit IGFBP-5 synthesis (8Canalis E. Pash J. Varghese S. Crit. Rev. Eukaryotic Gene Expression. 1993; 3: 155-166PubMed Google Scholar, 42Hurley M.M. Abreu C. Harrison J.R. Lichtler A.C. Raisz L.G. Kream B.E. J. Biol.

Furthermore, factors such as IGFs I and II, which stimulate osteoblastic differentiated function, increase IGFBP-5 synthesis and stability in bone cells (17McCarthy T.L. Casinghino S. Centrella M. Canalis E. J. Cell. Physiol. 1994; 160: 163-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 18Conover C.A. Bale L.K. Clarkson J.T. Torring O.

The stimulatory effects of IGFBP-5 on bone cell function are unique since IGFBP-2, −3, and −4 inhibit various parameters of bone formation (11Schmid C. Rutishauser J. Schlapfer I. Froesch E.R. Zapf J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 179: 579-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 12Feyen J.H. Evans D.B. Binkert C. Heinrich G.F. Geisse S. Kocher H.P. J. Biol.

Endocrinol. 1990; 4: 1806-1814Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). IGFBP-1 plays a role in glucose homeostasis, and it has not been reported to have a specific function in skeletal metabolism (44Kachra Z. Chang-Ren Y. Murphy L.J. Posner B.I. Endocrinology. 1994; 135: 1722-1728Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 45Lowe Jr., W.L. Endocrinology. 1994; 135: 1719-1721Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). IGFBP-6 inhibits IGF II-induced differentiation of myoblasts, but its effects in bone cells are not known (46Bach L.A. Hsieh S. Brown A.L. Rechler M.M. Endocrinology. 1994; 135: 2168-2176Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). In conclusion, the present studies demonstrate that bFGF, TGF β1, and PDGF BB inhibit IGFBP-5 transcripts and polypeptide levels in skeletal cells through mechanisms that may involve diminished transcription. The reduced level of IGFBP-5 by local growth factors in the bone microenvironment may constitute an important level of control of the autocrine and paracrine actions of IGF in bone via IGFBPs.

Shimasaki for the rat IGFBP-5 cDNA clone, Dr. Yu Dong for assistance with the design of IGFBP-5 intronic primers, Cathy Boucher and Deena Kjeldsen for technical assistance, and Beverly Faulds for expert secretarial help."

https://openalex.org/W2068197266,"To evaluate the function of transmembrane domain 1 (TMD1) of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) and the methionines that function in translation initiation, a series of progressive 5’ truncations in TMD1 were created to coincide with residues that might serve as translation initiation codons. Expression of the mutants in Xenopus oocytes demonstrated that internal sites in TMD1 can function as initiation codons. In addition, all of the mutants that progressively removed the first four transmembrane segments (M1-M4) of TMD1 expressed functional cAMP-regulated Cl- channels with ion selectivity identical to wild-type CFTR but with reduced open probability and single channel conductance. Further removal of transmembrane segments did not produce functional Cl- channels. These data suggest that segments M1-M4 are not essential components of the conduction pore or the selectivity filter of CFTR. To evaluate the function of transmembrane domain 1 (TMD1) of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) and the methionines that function in translation initiation, a series of progressive 5’ truncations in TMD1 were created to coincide with residues that might serve as translation initiation codons. Expression of the mutants in Xenopus oocytes demonstrated that internal sites in TMD1 can function as initiation codons. In addition, all of the mutants that progressively removed the first four transmembrane segments (M1-M4) of TMD1 expressed functional cAMP-regulated Cl- channels with ion selectivity identical to wild-type CFTR but with reduced open probability and single channel conductance. Further removal of transmembrane segments did not produce functional Cl- channels. These data suggest that segments M1-M4 are not essential components of the conduction pore or the selectivity filter of CFTR."
https://openalex.org/W2007594092,"Expression of fetal γ-globin genes in individuals with the deletion forms of hereditary persistence of fetal hemoglobin (HPFH) has been attributed either to enhancement by 3′ regulatory elements juxtaposed to γ-globin genes or to deletion of γ-gene silencers normally residing within the β-globin gene cluster. In the present study, we tested the hypothesis of imported enhancers downstream of β-globin gene using the HPFH-3 deletion as a model. The abnormal bridging fragment of 13.6 kilobases (kb) containing the Aγ-gene with its flanking sequences and 6.2 kb of the juxtaposed region was microinjected into fertilized mouse eggs. Twelve transgenic mice positive for the fragment were generated. Samples from 11.5-day yolk sacs, 16-day fetal liver, and adult blood were analyzed for Aγ-mRNA using RNase protection assays. Three mice lacked Aγ expression in the yolk sac indicating non-optimal integration site. Four expressed Aγ-mRNA at the embryonic stage only, while two expressed Aγ-mRNA in both embryonic and fetal liver erythroid cells. Since the Aγ-gene with its normal flanking sequences and in the absence of the locus control region is expressed only in embryonic cells of transgenic mice, these data suggest that the juxtaposed sequences have altered the developmental specificity of the fetal γ-globin gene. These sequences were further tested for the presence of an enhancer element, by their ability to activate a fusion reporter gene consisting of the CAT gene linked to the γ-globin gene promoter, in erythroid (K562) and non-erythroid (HeLa) cells. A 0.7-kb region located immediately 3′ to the breakpoint, enhanced chloramphenicol acetyltransferase activity by 3-fold in erythroid cells. The enhancer also activated the embryonic ε-globin gene promoter by 2-fold but not the adult β- or δ-globin gene promoters. The enhancer represents a region of previously known complex tandem repeats; in this study we have completed the sequencing of the region encompassing the 0.7-kb enhancer element. Multiple areas of the enhancer region exhibit homology to the core element of the simian virus 40 enhancer and to the sequences of the human 3′ Aγ- and the chicken 3′β-globin enhancers. A consensus binding site for the erythroid specific GATA-1 transcription factor and seven consensus sites for the ubiquitous CP1 transcription factor are also included within the enhancer. These data suggest that these sequences located immediately 3′ to the breakpoint of the HPFH-3 deletion, exhibit both the structure and the function of an enhancer, and can modify the developmental specificity of the fetal γ-globin genes, resulting in their continued expression during adult life.

INTRODUCTIONIn humans and in a few other species, two ontogenetic switches in globin gene expression occur within the β-globin gene cluster: one from embryonic to fetal (ε→γ) early in development and a second one from fetal to adult (γ→β) during the perinatal period. Experimental data so far suggest that these switches reflect temporal and tissue-specific interactions between cis and trans-acting regulatory elements of the β-globin gene cluster.A unique feature of hemoglobin switching in humans is the availability of many deletion mutants associated with continued fetal γ-gene expression in the adult life. The deletions in these mutants occur within the β-globin gene cluster and lead to clinical syndromes characterized by increased production of fetal hemoglobin (HbF)1 1The abbreviations used are: HbFfetal hemoglobinHPFHhereditary persistence of fetal hemoglobinLCRlocus control regionkbkilobase(s)ntnucleotide(s)CATchloramphenicol acetyltransferaseDHFRdihydrofolate reductasebpbase pair(s). in the adult life. The two syndromes, i.e. δβ-thalassemia and hereditary persistence of fetal hemoglobin (HPFH) exhibit discrete phenotypes regarding the levels of HbF and its distribution in the peripheral blood erythrocytes: HbF levels of 10-15% and heterocellular distribution in δβ-thalassemia versus 20-30% HbF levels and pancellular distribution in HPFH (1Bunn F. Forget B. Hemoglobin: Molecular, Genetic and Clinical Aspects. Saunders, Philadelphia1986Google Scholar, 2Stamatoyannopoulos G. Nienhuis A.W. Stamatoyannopoulos G. Nienhuis A.W. Majerus P.W. Varmus H. The Molecular Basis of Blood Diseases. 2nd Ed. W. B. Saunders, Philadelphia1994: 107-155Google Scholar).The HPFH syndromes resulting from large deletions of the human β-globin gene cluster provide a model to study the mechanisms of fetal γ-gene activation. So far, seven large deletions have been described that are all associated with increased and continued expression of fetal hemoglobin in adult life (1Bunn F. Forget B.

Three major hypotheses have been proposed to explain this failure of normal switching; one suggests that the increased γ-gene expression reflects enhancement by elements imported into the γ-globin gene region (5Tuan D. Feingold E. Neuman M. Weissman S.M. Forget B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 6937-6941Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), the other considers that silencer sequences in the Aγ to δ region are removed by these deletions (6Huisman T. Schroeder W. Efremov G. Duma H. Mladenovski B. Hyman C. Rachmilewitz E. Vouver N. Miller A. Brodie A. Shelton J.R. Shelton J.B. Appel G. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1974; 232: 107-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), while the third hypothesis considers that the increased and continued expression of the fetal γ-genes in adult life, reflects position effects on the fetal γ-genes by the juxtaposed downstream chromatin structure (7Flavell R.A. Bud H. Bullman H. Dahl H. DeBoer E. De Lange T. Groffen J. Grosveld F. Grosveld G. Kioussis D. Moschonas N. Shewmaker C. Stamatoyannopoulos G. Nienhuis A.W. Organization and Expression of Globin Genes. A. R. Liss, Inc., New York1987: 119-126Google Scholar). Recently, an enhancer element immediately 3′ to the deletion breakpoint of HPFH-1 deletion has been detected, which may play a role in the continued expression of γ-genes in HPFH-1 and HPFH-2 mutations (8Feingold E. Forget B. Blood. 1989; 74: 2178-2186Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).In the present study we decided to test the validity of the first hypothesis using as a model the HPFH-3 deletion, whose 3′ breakpoint is located 30 kb downstream of the β-gene, removing 48.5 kb of DNA (9Kutlar A.

Using bioassays such as transgenic mice and transient assays in erythroid and non-erythroid cells, we characterized an enhancer element 3′ to breakpoint of HPFH-3 that can modify the developmental specificity of Aγ-gene, resulting in persistence of fetal γ-globin gene expression in adult life.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESDNA Construct MicroinjectionsThe abnormal 13.6-kb bridging fragment containing the normal fetal Aγ-globin gene, its flanking sequences, and 6.2 kb of juxtaposed sequences was reconstituted as follows: the cloned (10Henthorn P.S. Mager D.L. Huisman T. Smithies O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 5194-5198Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar) 11.5-kb XbaI fragment (kindly provided by Dr. O. Smithies) was ligated with the 2.0-kb HindIII- XbaI fragment containing the 5′ end of the Aγ-globin gene (Fig. 1). Prior to ligation, the HindIII site had been destroyed and replaced by a NotI site, to facilitate cleavage of the 13.6-kb reconstituted insert as an intact NotI- SmaI fragment. The utilized SmaI site resides 11 bp from the 3′ XbaI site in the pUC18 polylinker. This strategy also avoids the presence of plasmid sequences in the construct that are deleterious in the transgenic mouse bioassay.Transgenic Embryos and FetusesThe 13.6-kb DNA fragment following digestion with NotI- SmaI was excised from the pUC18 vector and was purified following cesium chloride gradient ultracentrifugation (11Chada K. Magran J. Costantini F. Nature. 1986; 319: 685-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Following dialysis, the DNA was suspended in fresh TE buffer (10 mM Tris, 1 mM EDTA), extracted with phenol, phenol-chloroform, and chloroform, and then subjected to ethanol precipitation. DNA concentration was accurately measured using a Hoeffer TKO 100 DNA fluorometer. DNA fragments of the reconstituted insert (3-6 ng/μl) were microinjected into the pronuclei of (C57BL/6J × CBA/J)F2 mouse zygotes as described previously (12Hogan B. Costantini F. Lacy E. Manipulating the Mouse Embryo: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1986Google Scholar, 13Perez-Stable C. Costantini F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 1116-1125Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Transgenic embryos and fetuses were identified by Southern blot analysis.RNA Analysis from Embryonic, Fetal, and Adult TissuesTotal cellular RNA was isolated from 11.5-day embryonic yolk sacs, 16-day fetal livers, and adult blood of the various transgenic lines, as described previously (12Hogan B. Costantini F. Lacy E. Manipulating the Mouse Embryo: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1986Google Scholar, 13Perez-Stable C. Costantini F. Mol. Cell.

The levels of Aγ- mRNA were measured with a 32P-labeled SP6 polymerase-synthesized antisense RNA probe (560 nt) specific for the 3′ end of Aγ-globin mRNA. The probe was hybridized and digested as described (11Chada K. Magran J. Costantini F. Nature. 1986; 319: 685-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 13Perez-Stable C. Costantini F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 1116-1125Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) resulting in a 165-nt Aγ-gene-specific protected fragment.The levels of human globin mRNAs in the erythroid tissues of transgenic mice were estimated by comparison to the hybridization signals obtained with various amounts of hemin-induced human K562 cell RNA. The results are expressed as picograms of Aγ-globin mRNA per microgram of total mRNA. In these cells, ∼∼16 pg of γ-mRNA/μg of total mRNA are detected (11Chada K. Magran J. Costantini F. Nature. 1986; 319: 685-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 15Enver T. Zhang J.W. Anagnou N.P. Stamatoyannopoulos G. Papayannopoulou T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 4917-4926Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), while the Gγ/Aγ ratio is >10; (see Fig. 2, K562 line). Only the 165-nt fully protected fragment was considered for the quantitation. Comparison of the Aγ-mRNA levels to the endogenous mouse embryonic globin mRNA was performed with the same human probe, since cross-hybridization with endogenous embryonic mRNA results in a protected fragment of low molecular size.Figure 2:Expression of the HPFH-3 transgene in embryonic blood, fetal liver, and adult blood measured by RNase protection analysis. A, an RNA probe specific for the 3′ end of Aγ-globin mRNA (560 nt) was hybridized and digested as described (11, 13) resulting in a 165-nt protected fragment (pf). Lanes K562 1-6 contain 0, 0.03, 0.15, 0.75, 3, and 7.5 μg of total mRNA from hemin-induced K562 cells, respectively. The smaller <85-nt protected fragment corresponds to cross-hybridization with Gγ-specific mRNA. The remaining lanes show the analysis of 15 μg each (except in 1-7, 1.5 μg) of 11.5-day mouse embryonic (E) blood mRNA, 50 μg of 16-day fetal (F) liver mRNA, and 20 μg of adult (A) blood mRNA from the six HPFH-3 transgenic lines 1-1, 1-4, 1-5, 1-7, 2-2, and 3-5. Cross-hybridization with endogenous mouse embryonic globin mRNA results in low molecular size fragments seen at the bottom of the gel for the E lanes. Lane M contains 32P-labeled size markers (pBR322 digested with HpaII), some of whose sizes are indicated on the right. B, expression of the HPFH-3 transgene in 16-day fetal liver.

For comparison, 15 μg of embryonic (E) blood mRNA from lines 1-4 and 1-5 and 100 μg of fetal (F) liver mRNA from lines 1-4, 1-5, and 3-5, respectively, were analyzed. Lanes 1, 2, 15, 42, 47, and 51 represent a total of 36, 66, 35, 32, 33 and 46 μg of total fetal liver mRNA from the corresponding transient HPFH-3 transgenes 1, 2, 15, 42, 47, and 51, respectively.

The F and F1 fragments differ in the sense that the latter contains purely sequences residing immediately 3′ to the breakpoint of the deletion, while F contains 66 bp of the Alu repeats residing immediately upstream of the breakpoint (see Figs. 1 and 3). The isolated fragments were subcloned upon modification of their ends in both orientations either into the BamHI site (fragments A and B), SmaI site (fragments C, D, F1, H, J, and I), or the AvaI- BamHI sites (fragments F and G) of the polylinker region of the pUC18 and pUC19 plasmids. The resulting recombinant plasmids were then subjected to SalI digestion, and the 2.1-kb SalI fragment derived from plasmid γ-CAT (kindly provided by Dr. D. Bodine) was subcloned into the SalI site in both orientations in all the plasmids (Fig. 3). This fragment (16Bodine D. Ley T.J. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 2997-3004Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) contains the human Gγ-globin promoter gene (−384 to +36 relative to the cap site) fused with the CAT gene. By employing the above strategy, the fragments were subcloned into both orientations (5′→3′ and 3′→5′) and in both positions (upstream and downstream) relative to γ-CAT gene (i.e. pγCATX1, pγCATX2, pγCATX3 and pγCATX4) as shown in Fig. 3. For the analysis of the effects of the enhancer element on the heterologous globin and non-globin promoters, the individual promoter elements (17Fordis M.C. Nelson N. Dean A. Schechter A.

The F fragment, containing the enhancer element was subcloned in both orientations, 3′ to the promoter-CAT fusion genes, i.e. into the BamHI (βCAT and δCAT), HpaI (εCAT), and AvaI (DHFR-CAT) sites, respectively.Figure 3:Experimental strategy followed for the detection of enhancer-like elements within the 3′ juxtaposed sequences of the HPFH-3 deletion mutation.

Following growth in mid-log phase, the cells were plated in 10 ml of medium on 100-cm2dishes. Twenty-four h after plating, the cells were transfected with equimolar amounts (i.e. about 10 μg) of supercoiled DNA of the various constructs using DNA-calcium phosphate precipitation, as described previously (16Bodine D. Ley T.J. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 2997-3004Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 18Mamalaki A. Moschonas N. Acta Hematol. 1990; 84: 30-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). A standard amount (3 μg) of plasmid pCH110 (19Hall C. Jacob C. Ringcold G. Lee F. J. Mol. Appl. Genet. 1983; 2: 101-109PubMed Google Scholar) was added to each DNA-calcium phosphate preparation for normalization of the transfection efficiency using the β-galactosidase assay (20Herbomel P. Bourachot B. Yaniv M. Cell. 1984; 39: 653-662Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar). The total amount of DNA (20 μg/plate) was kept constant by adding the appropriate amount of sheared salmon sperm DNA. The protein concentration of the cell extract was quantitated using a protein assay kit (Bio-Rad). Forty-eight h after transfection, the cells were harvested, lysed, and the protein concentration of the cleared lysate was determined as described (21Lowry O.H. Rosenbrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), while CAT activity was analyzed by the method of Gorman et al. (22Gorman C. Moffat L.F. Howard B. Mol.

Six mice were independent founders, and six mice were used as “transient” transgenes sacrificed at day 16, followed by analysis of their fetal liver mRNA, using an RNA protection assay. In the six founder lines three mice failed to express the Aγ-gene in 11.5-day embryonic blood, probably due to integration into an inactive chromatin region (Fig. 2 and Table I). The other three mice expressed the Aγ-gene in levels ranging from 4 to 0.02% of the endogenous mouse embryonic globin mRNA (). Of the last three mice, two (lines 1-5 and 1-4) failed to express further the Aγ-gene, while mouse 3-5 expressed the Aγ-gene in 16-day liver, which is the organ of adult erythropoiesis. An additional mouse (line 42) of the group of transient HPFH-3 transgenic mice, expressed also the Aγ-gene in 16-day fetal liver (Table II and Fig. 2). Thus, the human Aγ-gene in the two mice, when fused with the 3′ juxtaposed sequences of the HPFH-3 deletion, was expressed beyond the stage that is normally expressed, i.e. the 11.5-day embryonic blood (11Chada K.

These data suggested a putative regulatory role of these juxtaposed sequences on the developmental specificity of the Aγ-gene.Table I:Expression of HPFH-3 transgenes in embryonic blood, fetal liver, and adult blood Open table in a new tab Table II:Expression of transient HPFH-3 transgenes in fetal liver Open table in a new tab Identification of an Enhancer 3′ to Breakpoint of the HPFH-3 DeletionTo further investigate the role of the 3′ juxtaposed sequences of the HPFH-3 deletion, 10 overlapping and contiguous fragments spanning the entire 6.2 kb region were subcloned in both orientations (5′→3′ and 3′→5′) and in both positions (upstream and downstream) of the γCAT hybrid reporter gene (Fig. 3) which has been shown to be enhancer-responsive in K562 cells (16Bodine D. Ley T.J. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 2997-3004Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). A series of 26 constructs were individually transfected into uninduced K562 cells, hemin-induced K562 cells, and HeLa cells, which were cultured for 48 h and were then analyzed for CAT activity. I shows the results of the analysis for the detection of the enhancer element. The enhancerless γCAT plasmid was used as the reference basic plasmid, and its relative CAT activity was considered as 1.0. The 11 γCAT plasmid, carrying the 2.3-kb EcoRI fragment containing the 3′ Aγ enhancer (16Bodine D. Ley T.J. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 2997-3004Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) was used as a positive control. Of the 24 recombinant plasmids tested, only plasmids with the F1, F, and G fragments (and to a lesser extent the ones with the A fragment) demonstrated enhancer activity by increasing almost 3-fold the average relative CAT activity of the γCAT plasmid in induced K562 cells (Table III). This activity was less pronounced in uninduced K562 cells. The increased γCAT expression by the F1, F, and G fragments was independent of their orientation (5′→3′ or 3′→5′) and position (upstream or downstream) relative to γCAT, a feature consistent with other transcriptional enhancers (16Bodine D. Ley T.J. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 2997-3004Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 27Khoury G. Gruss P. Cell. 1983; 33: 313-314Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar, 28Queen C.

Analysis of the effects of the F1, F, G, A, and H fragments, on the activation of the γCAT reporter gene, permitted the localization of the enhancer core element immediately 3′ to the breakpoint, extending for about 700 bp downstream (Fig. 4). Furthermore, the comparable activity of the F1 and F fragments ensures that the whole enhancer effect is actually conferred by the 0.7 kb region and that there is no aberrant synergy between the enhancer element and the residual Alu sequences contained in fragment F. When the same recombinant γCAT plasmids were used to transfect non-erythroid HeLa cells, both F and G fragments failed to increase the level of CAT activity, suggesting that the enhancer element is probably erythroid-specific (data not shown).Table III:Relative CAT activity in uninduced (−) and hemin-induced K562 (+) cells, transfected with the various plasmids containing the individual fragments of the juxtaposed region Open table in a new tab Figure 4:Identification and completion of the sequencing of the enhancer core element. A, analysis of the effects of the F1, F, G, A, and H fragments on the activation of the γCAT gene localized the enhancer element (hatched bar) immediately 3′ from the breakpoint (vertical arrow), extending downstream for about 700 bp. The region corresponding to the F fragment has been previously sequenced by Henthorn et al. (10). Sequence analysis revealed that the region immediately 3′ to the breakpoint of the deletion contains a complex array of repeated sequences (10). The 3′ end half of a perfect palindrome is indicated by the large open arrow, starting just 3 bp before the breakpoint. A set of seven short tandem repeats is shown as solid arrows. An interruption of 24 bases of unrelated sequences (shown as hatched bars) occurs at the fourth repeat. The CCAAT motif is shown as a dot. There are two CCAAT motifs on the sixth repeat and a seventh CCAAT motif (boxed) was found at the 3′ end of the enhancer (see panel B). At the 3′ end of the enhancer region there is a consensus (A/T)GATA(A/G) motif for the binding of the erythroid-specific transcription factor GATA-1. B, sequencing of the novel 431 bp region encompassing the 3′ end of the enhancer element. The novel sequences start from position 55 (corresponding to 466 nt from the breakpoint of the HPFH-3 deletion) and end up at position 485. The upstream 466 bp region starting from the 3′ end of the breakpoint and terminating close to the BamHI site (GGATCC, underlined by light broken line) has been sequenced previously by Henthorn et al. (10); these sequences just upstream of the BamHI site are highlighted. The motif for the SV40 core element (GTGGTCTG) is boxed. The novel CCAAT motif is also boxed and the PstI site (CTGCAG) is underlined with a heavy broken line. The HphI site (GTAACACTCACC) marking the 3′ end of the F1 fragment is underlined with a solid line.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Activation of Heterologous Promoters by the HPFH-3 Enhancer ElementTo test the ability of the 3′ enhancer element to increase transcription from other globin or non-globin promoters, fragment F (exhibiting the highest activity) was subcloned 3′ to the CAT gene in both orientations (5′→3′ and 3′→5′) into vectors containing several hybrid genes such as β-globin-CAT, δ-globin-CAT, ε-globin-CAT, and DHFR-CAT (16Bodine D.

https://openalex.org/W2074217149,"We describe the effects of overproduction of methionyl-tRNA transformylase and initiation factors IF2 and IF3 on the activity, in vivo, of initiator tRNA mutants defective at specific steps of the initiation process in protein synthesis. The activity of the U35A36/G72 and U35A36/G72G73 mutants, which are defective in formylation, was increased by overproduction of methionyl-tRNA transformylase. In contrast, the activity of the C30:G40/U35A36 mutant, which is formylated normally but is defective in binding to the ribosomal P site, was not increased. Overproduction of IF2 had a strong stimulatory effect on the activity of virtually all the mutants carrying the U35A36 anticodon sequence change, including the U35A36, U35A36/G72, U35A36/G72G73, and the C30:G40/U35A36 mutants. In cells overproducing IF2, the amount of protein made by translation of a mutant mRNA, which uses the U35A36 mutant initiator tRNA, is severalfold higher than that made by translation of a wild type mRNA.

Overproduction of IF3 did not affect the initiator activity of any of the tRNA mutants studied. INTRODUCTIONInitiation of protein synthesis occurs universally with methionine or its derivative formylmethionine. Of the two classes of methionine tRNAs found in all organisms, the initiator is used exclusively for the initiation of protein synthesis, whereas the elongator is used for inserting methionine into internal peptidic linkages (1Kozak M. Microbiol. Rev. 1983; 47: 1-45Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In eubacteria, mitochondria, and chloroplasts the initiator tRNA is used as formylmethionyl-tRNA (fMet-tRNA) (2Marcker K. Sanger F. J. Mol. Biol. 1964; 8: 835-840Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar), whereas in the cytoplasm of eukaryotes, it is used as methionyl-tRNA (Met-tRNA). Formylation of the initiator Met-tRNA is catalyzed by the enzyme methionyl-tRNA transformylase (abbreviated here as MTF)1 1The abbreviations used are: MTFmethionyl-tRNA transformylaseCATchloramphenicol acetyltransferaseGlnRSglutaminyl-tRNA synthetaseMetRSmethionyl-tRNA synthetaseIPTGisopropyl-1-thio-β-D-galactopyranosidefGlnformylglutaminePTHpeptidyl-tRNA hydrolase. (3Dickerman H.W. Steers Jr., E. Redfield B.G. Weissbach H. J. Biol. Chem. 1967; 242: 1522-1525Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The fMet-tRNA then binds specifically to the P site on the ribosome. This binding requires the initiation factors IF2 and IF3 (4Gualerzi C.O. Pon C.L. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 5881-5889Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar).The key features in the Escherichia coli initiator tRNA important for formylation and for targeting the fMet-tRNA to the P site on the ribosome have been identified. The base-base mismatch at the end of the acceptor stem unique to all eubacterial initiator tRNAs is important for formylation of the tRNA and for preventing the tRNA from participating in elongation and from being a substrate for peptidyl-tRNA hydrolase (5RajBhandary U.L.

Meinnel T. Lazennec C. Mechulam Y. Blanquet S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 4025-4030Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The 3 consecutive G:C base pairs found in the anticodon stem of virtually all initiator tRNAs are important for binding of the tRNA to the P site on the ribosome (14Seong B.L. RajBhandary U.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 334-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar).Initiation factors are thought to help ribosomes select initiator tRNA over other tRNAs at the P site on the ribosome (4Gualerzi C.O. Pon C.L. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 5881-5889Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar). However, the mechanism by which IF2 and IF3 facilitate this is not known. The presence of an N-blocked amino acid such as formylmethionine, which is normally found only in the initiator tRNA, is important for binding of the fMet-tRNA to IF2 (15Sundari R. Stringer E.A. Schulman L.H. Maitra U. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 3338-3345Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Whether other sequences in the initiator tRNA are also important is not known. Protection experiments have shown that the formylmethionine group, parts of the acceptor stem and the T stem, and loop of the initiator tRNA are shielded by IF2 (16Wakao H. Romby P. Westhof E. Laalami S. Grunberg-Manago M. Ebel J.-P. Ehresmann C. Ehresmann B. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 20363-20371Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Similarly, results of toeprint analyses indicate that parts of the anticodon stem and loop sequence and/or structure are important for IF3 recognition of the initiator tRNA (17Hartz D. McPheeters D.S. Gold L. Genes & Dev. 1989; 3: 1899-1912Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar, 18Hartz D. Binkley J. Hollingsworth T. Gold L. Genes & Dev. 1990; 4: 1790-1800Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar).During work on structure-function relationship of E. coli initiator tRNA, we generated a number of tRNA mutants which are defective at specific steps in the initiation pathway (4Gualerzi C.O. Pon C.L. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 5881-5889Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar). This has allowed us to ask whether the activity of the mutant tRNAs could be rescued by overproduction of one or another component of the translational machinery. For example, will overproduction of IF2 allow the utilization of unformylated mutant initiator tRNA in initiation? Will overproduction of IF3 increase activity of a tRNA defective at the step involving binding to the ribosomal P site?In this paper, we describe the effect of overproduction of MTF and the initiation factors IF2 and IF3 on activity of the various mutant initiator tRNAs. For these studies, we use an in vivo assay for initiation involving mutant tRNAs carrying an anticodon sequence change from CAU to CUA and, as reporter, a mutant chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) gene with UAG as the initiator codon instead of AUG (9Varshney U. Lee C.-P. Seong B.L. RajBhandary U.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 18018-18024Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Varshney U. RajBhandary U.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 1586-1590Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). We show that overproduction of MTF rescues specifically the activity of those mutants which are inactive in initiation due to their being poor substrates for formylation but not mutants which are defective at a later step in binding to the P site on the ribosome. Overproduction of IF2 increases the level of CAT activity in cells carrying all of the mutant tRNAs having the CUA anticodon. Overproduction of IF3 had no effect on CAT synthesis with any of the mutants tested.MATERIALS AND METHODSStrains and PlasmidsThe E. coli strains CA274 (HfrH lacZ125am trpEam) (20Smith J.D. Celis J.E. Nature New Biol. 1973; 243: 66-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar) and AA7852 (pthts) (21Atherly A.G. Menninger J.R. Nature New Biol. 1972; 240: 245-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) were described previously. Plasmid pRSVCATam1.2.5 (Fig. 1, left) harboring the mutant CAT gene and the various mutant tRNA genes (19Varshney U. RajBhandary U.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 1586-1590Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), pACT7 (19Varshney U. RajBhandary U.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Gene (Amst.). 1986; 47: 179-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), and pAC1 and its derivatives containing the genes for GlnRS or MetRS (19Varshney U. RajBhandary U.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 1586-1590Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 23Varshney U. RajBhandary U.L. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 7819-7826Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) were described before. Plasmid pAA2 (24Dondon J. Plumbridge J.A. Hershey J.W.B. Grunberg-Manago M. Biochimie (Paris). 1985; 67: 643-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar) containing the IF2 gene and pIM302 (25Brombach M. Pon C.L. Mol. & Gen. Genet. 1987; 208: 94-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) harboring the IF3 gene were obtained from Drs. John Hershey and Cynthia Pon, respectively. Plasmid pBluescript II SK+, pET3d, and pACYC184 were obtained from Stratagene, Novagen, and New England Biolabs, respectively.Cloning of the Gene for Methionyl-tRNA TransformylaseThe gene for MTF used in this study (designated fmt) is on a DNA fragment which contains the gene for a peptide deformylase (designated fms) upstream of the fmt gene (26Guillon J.-M. Mechulam Y. Schmitter J.-M. Blanquet S. Fayat G. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 4294-4301Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 27Meinnel T. Blanquet S. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 7737-7740Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The fms and fmt genes are part of an operon in E. coli and are transcribed as a dicistronic mRNA (28Meinnel T. Guillon J.-M. Mechulam Y. Blanquet S. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 993-1000Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Two DNA fragments containing the fmt gene were isolated by amplification of E. coli chromosomal DNA using the polymerase chain reaction method. The primers 5’-GATCGAATTCTCTAGAATAGAAGAAATAAT-3’ and 5’-CTCTAAGCTTCATAAGTATAAAAACGCCCG-3’ were used to isolate a 1.6-kilobase pair fragment containing the fms-fmt tandem genes. Another primer, 5’-TACTGAATTCTAAGGATAAGAACTAACATG-3’, was used to isolate a 1-kilobase pair fragment containing the fmt gene alone. This primer also carried a mutation which changed the GUG initiation codon in the fmt gene to AUG. Both fragments were cloned into the EcoRI-HindIII site of the plasmid pGFIBI. In these constructs, the fms-fmt and the fmt genes are under control of the E. coli lipoprotein promoter.Constructs for Overproduction of GlnRS, MetRS, MTF, IF2, and IF3The pACD vector used for overproduction of GlnRS, MetRS, MTF, or IF2 (Fig. 1, right) was generated by replacing the small AvaI-PvuII fragment of pACYC184 with an 820-base pair PvuII-SalI fragment from pBluescript II SK+. Incompatible cohesive ends were filled in using the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I in the presence of dNTPs. The 820-base pair PvuII-SalI fragment contains a Lac promoter and the Shine-Dalgarno and transcription termination sequences of gene 10 of bacteriophage T7. The transcription and translation signals of gene 10 were excised from pET3d as an XbaI-EcoRI fragment and cloned into the XbaI-EcoRI sites in pBluescript II SK+.GlnRS and MetRSEcoRI fragments containing the gene for GlnRS or MetRS were excised from pACQS or pACMS (23Varshney U. RajBhandary U.L. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 7819-7826Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), respectively, and cloned into the EcoRI site of pACD. The resulting plasmids, pACDGlnRS and pACDMetRS, were then used as vectors for the cloning of genes for MTF or IF2.MTFThe fms-fmt gene was cloned into the EspI site of pACD or pACDGlnRS. The vectors were digested with CelII (an isoschizomer of EspI), the cohesive ends were filled in and ligated to a PvuII fragment (see above) from pGFIBI which contains the fms-fmt genes under the control of the E. coli lipoprotein promoter. The monomeric fmt gene (see above) was excised from pGFIBI with AflIII and PvuII and cloned into the NcoI (compatible with AflIII) and CelII sites in the pACDGlnRS vector. The CelII ends were filled in using the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I. In this construct the fmt gene is under the control of the lac promoter and the Shine-Dalgarno sequence from bacteriophage T7 gene 10.Overproduction of MTF from the dimeric construct (Fig. 1, right) was about 58-78-fold over normal levels, whereas that from the monomeric construct was about 6-fold (data not shown). A similar observation was made previously (26Guillon J.-M. Mechulam Y. Schmitter J.-M. Blanquet S. Fayat G. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 4294-4301Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). The dimeric construct was used for most of the experiments described here.IF2A 3.6-kilobase pair fragment containing the gene for IF2 was excised from pAA2 with BamHI and SalI and first cloned between similar sites in pBluescript. The pBluescript-IF2 plasmid was digested with SphI and the SphI ends were filled in using T4 DNA polymerase prior to digestion with NotI. The large NotI-SphI fragment containing the IF2 gene was then cloned between the NotI and CelII sites of pACDGlnRS and pACDMetRS. The CelII ends were filled in using the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I. In both of these constructs, the IF2 gene is under the control of the lac promoter.IF3The pACIF3 plasmid was constructed by excising a 1-kilobase pair BamHI-EcoRI fragment containing the IF3 gene from pIM302 and inserting it between the EcoRI-SalI sites of pACT7. Incompatible ends, the BamHI site in the fragment and the SalI site in the vector, were filled in using the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I. The IF3 gene is under the control of the lac promoter.Overproduction of IF2 and IF3 was confirmed by immunoblot analysis of cell extracts (29Howe J.G. Yanov J. Meyer L. Johnston K. Hershey J.W.B. Arch. Biophys. Biochem. 1978; 191: 813-820Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 30Pramanik A. Wertheimer S.J. Schwartz J.J. Schwartz I. J. Bacteriol. 1986; 168: 746-751Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and by Coomassie Blue staining of protein gels. Both proteins are expressed to about 10-20% of the total cell protein (data not shown).Growth of CellsTransformants of E. coli CA274 and AA7852 (pthts) strains were grown overnight at 37 and 30°C, respectively, in Luria-Bertani medium supplemented with antibiotics as necessary. An aliquot of the overnight culture was diluted 20-fold into 3 ml of fresh medium containing antibiotics as required and IPTG, for full induction of IF2 and IF3 genes, and grown for another 3-5 h (depending upon the strain, see legends to figures) under shaking. For cells overproducing IF2, which grew slightly slower, the overnight culture was diluted only 10-fold. No significant difference was noted when a 20-fold dilution was used. When required, ampicillin, kanamycin, tetracycline, and IPTG were added to concentrations of 100 μg/ml, 20 μg/ml, 7.5 μg/ml, and 1 mM, respectively.Preparation of Cell ExtractsCells from 1.2 ml of culture were pelleted by centrifugation for 10 min at 4°C using a Brinkman microcentrifuge and lysed as described (9Varshney U. Lee C.-P. Seong B.L. RajBhandary U.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 18018-18024Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The cell lysate was centrifuged for 10 min at 4°C. An aliquot of the supernatant was mixed with either 1 volume of CAT storage buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 200 mM NaCl, 10 mMβ-mercaptoethanol, and 70% glycerol (w/v)) or 3 volumes of MTF storage buffer (25.6 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 13.3 mMβ-mercaptoethanol, 200 mM KCl, and 66.7% glycerol (w/v)) and stored at −20°C.Enzyme AssaysThe activity of chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT), MTF, and β-lactamase in cell extracts were assayed as described (9Varshney U. Lee C.-P. Seong B.L. RajBhandary U.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 18018-18024Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To minimize the effect of any changes in pRSVCATam1.2.5 plasmid copy numbers, the specific activities of chloramphenicol acetyltransferase are normalized to the specific activities of β-lactamase in the same extract.Analysis of the in Vivo Level of Formylation of tRNATotal tRNA was isolated under acidic conditions from E. coli as described (31Varshney U. Lee C.-P. RajBhandary U.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 24712-24718Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The cells were resuspended in 300 mM sodium acetate, pH 4.5, 1 mM sodium EDTA, and subjected to phenol extraction. Total RNA was precipitated with 2.5 volumes of cold ethanol. The precipitate was dissolved in 60 μl of 300 mM sodium acetate, pH 4.5, 1 mM sodium EDTA and reprecipitated with 2.5 volumes of cold ethanol. The RNA was dissolved in 20 μl of 10 mM sodium acetate, pH 4.5, 1 mM sodium EDTA. An aliquot containing (0.0025-0.005 OD260 unit) was subjected to electrophoresis on a 6.5% urea polyacrylamide gel at pH 5.0 and 4°C. The tRNAs were transferred to Nytran membrane (31Varshney U. Lee C.-P. RajBhandary U.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 24712-24718Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the mutant initiator tRNAs were detected using a probe complementary to nucleotides 29-47 or 40-56 of the U35A36 mutant tRNA. Uncharged tRNA markers were prepared by incubating an aliquot of the isolated tRNA with an equal volume of 100 mM Tris-HCl, pH 9.0, for 1 h at 37°C.General MethodsProtein concentration was determined by the modified Lowry DC method as described by the supplier (Bio-Rad) using IgG as the standard. Samples for SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis were solubilized by boiling for 5 min in 62.5 mM Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, containing 4.0% SDS (w/v), 10% glycerol (v/v), 10%β-mercaptoethanol, and 0.02% bromphenol. Electrophoretic transfer of proteins onto Immobilon membrane was performed for 2 h at 100 volts using a transfer solution composed of 25 mM Tris, 192 mM glycine, 20% methanol (v/v), and 0.01% SDS (w/v). The pH of the solution was 8.3. For immunoblot analyses, bound antibodies were detected using the ECL kit obtained from Amersham Corp. An Applied Biosystems 380A DNA Synthesizer was used for the synthesis of oligonucleotides. A Perkin-Elmer thermoregulator was used to carry out the polymerase chain reaction.RESULTSMutants of the E. coli Initiator tRNAFig. 2 (left) indicates the sites of mutations in the initiator tRNA used in this study. The mutations in the main body of the tRNA are coupled to those in the anticodon sequence from CAU to CUA (U35A36). The CUA sequence allows the assessment of the initiator activity of the mutant tRNAs in vivo by measuring the level of CAT expression from a reporter CAT gene, CATam1.2.5, which has UAG as the initiation codon (9Varshney U. Lee C.-P. Seong B.L. RajBhandary U.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 18018-18024Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Varshney U. RajBhandary U.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 1586-1590Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Because of the anticodon sequence change, the mutant tRNAs are aminoacylated with glutamine. Therefore, protein synthesis from the CAT-am1.2.5 mRNA is initiated with formylglutamine (fGln). Based on amounts of the CAT protein and CAT activity found in extracts, the U35A36 anticodon sequence mutant is almost as good an initiator as the wild type tRNA (9Varshney U. Lee C.-P. Seong B.L. RajBhandary U.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 18018-18024Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The G72 and G72G73 acceptor stem mutations make the mutant tRNA extremely poor substrates for MTF in vitro and in vivo(8Lee C.-P. Seong B.L. RajBhandary U.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 18012-18017Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Varshney U. Lee C.-P. Seong B.L. RajBhandary U.L. J. Biol.

Consequently, the U35A36/G72 and U35A36/G72G73 tRNAs are very poor initiators (9Varshney U. Lee C.-P. Seong B.L. RajBhandary U.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 18018-18024Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The C30:G40 and the U29C30A31:U39G40A41 anticodon stem mutants are good substrates for the formylating enzyme (8Lee C.-P. Seong B.L. RajBhandary U.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 18012-18017Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 31Varshney U. Lee C.-P. RajBhandary U.L. J. Biol.

With the formylation defective mutants (U35A36/G72 and U35A36/G72G73) also, overproduction of GlnRS alone did not affect their activity in initiation. However, overproduction of MTF led to increases in CAT activity in cells carrying the U35A36/G72 and U35A36/G72G73 mutant tRNAs from 1.6 and 0.6% to 14.5 and 3.8%, respectively. When both GlnRS and MTF were overproduced, there was a further increase in CAT activity to 66 and 8.0%, respectively. The increase in activity of these mutant tRNAs in initiation depended upon the extent of overproduction of MTF. When the extent of overproduction of MTF was reduced to 6-fold over normal levels by using the pACD vector carrying the GlnRS gene and the DNA fragment containing the fmt gene alone, CAT activity in cells carrying the U35A36/G72 mutant increased only to about 10%, instead of 66% as found in cells overproducing MTF by about 60-fold (data not shown).Table IEffect of overproduction of GlnRS, MTF, or GlnRS and MTF on activity of mutant tRNAs in initiation Open table in a new tab Effect of Overproduction of MTF on Formylation of the U35A36/G72 Mutant tRNA in VivoTotal tRNA was isolated under acidic conditions from E. coli CA274 transformants expressing the U35A36 and U35A36/G72 initiator tRNA mutants and GlnRS or GlnRS and MTF. The tRNAs were separated on a urea polyacrylamide gel and the various forms of the initiator tRNA corresponding to the deacylated tRNA (band A), formylaminoacyl-tRNA (band B), and aminoacyl-tRNA (band C) were detected by Northern hybridization (Fig. 3). A probe for the endogenous tyrosine tRNA (detected as bands D and E corresponding, respectively, to deacylated tRNA and aminoacyl-tRNA) was used as an internal control to ensure that approximately the same amount of total tRNA was analyzed. The U35A36 mutant tRNA was previously shown to be a good substrate for MTF. As expected, this mutant tRNA is essentially quantitatively formylated, irrespective of whether the cells are overproducing MTF or not (cf.Fig. 3, lanes 2 and 3). In contrast, there is no formylation of the U35A36/G72 mutant tRNA in cells overproducing GlnRS alone (Fig. 3, lane 5). A very low level of formylation of the U35A36/G72 mutant tRNA (band B) was detected when GlnRS and MTF were co-expressed (Fig. 3, lane 6). This band is more discernible in films exposed for longer periods (data not shown).Figure 3:Northern blot analysis of mutant initiator tRNAs isolated from E. coli CA274 overproducing GlnRS or GlnRS and MTF. The transformants were grown overnight at 37°C in LB containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin and 7.5 μg/ml tetracycline. An aliquot (200 μl) was transferred to 4 ml of fresh medium containing antibiotics and grown for 5 h. Total tRNA was isolated under acidic conditions and an aliquot (0.005 OD260) was subjected to electrophoresis on a urea polyacrylamide gel at pH 5.0. The tRNA was transferred to nytran membrane and the mutant initiator tRNAs were detected with a 32P-labeled oligonucleotide complementary to nucleotides 29-47 of the U35A36 mutant initiator tRNA (Fig. 2).

Introduction of a base pair between nucleotides 1 and 72 in the initiator tRNA makes this tRNA a good substrate for the PTH enzyme (12Guillon J.-M. Mechulam Y. Blanquet S. Fayat G. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 4507-4514Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 32Lee C.-P. Dyson M.R. Mandal N. Varshney U. Bahramian B. RajBhandary U.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

This could account for the very low steady state level of formylation of the U35A36/G72 mutant when both MTF and GlnRS were overproduced; that is, the fGln-tRNA species produced was deacylated by the PTH enzyme to fGln and tRNA. Analysis of the U35A36/G72 mutant tRNA isolated from an E. coli strain AA7852 carrying a temperature-sensitive mutation in the PTH enzyme confirms this possibility (Fig. 4). A band corresponding to formylaminoacyl-tRNA (band B) was observed when E. coli AA7852 expressing the U35A36/G72 mutant tRNA, GlnRS, and MTF was grown at 30°C (lane 3). This band was not present when GlnRS alone was overproduced (lane 2). Inactivation of the PTH enzyme by further incubating the cells at 37°C resulted in most of the U35A36/G72 mutant tRNA being formylated when GlnRS and MTF were co-expressed (lane 5), whereas a very small amount of the tRNA was formylated when GlnRS alone was overproduced (lane 4).Figure 4:Northern blot analysis of mutant initiator tRNA isolated from E. coli AA7852 (pthts) cells overproducing GlnRS or GlnRS and MTF and grown at 30 or at 37°C.

A portion of the culture (4 ml) was used to isolate total tRNA and another portion was incubated at 37°C for 3 more h prior to isolation of total tRNA.

TPA blocked the activity of the rat AFP promoter in a dose-dependent manner. Overexpression of c-Jun specifically repressed the rat AFP promoter but not the albumin promoter. JunB and JunD were poorer inhibitors. c-Fos expression did not potentiate the negative effect of Jun. The Jun-induced repression does not require binding of c-Jun to the AFP promoter. DNase 1 footprinting experiments did not display any high affinity binding site for Jun on the AFP promoter. Integrity of the c-Jun DNA binding domain is not required for the c-Jun protein to block the AFP promoter. The N-terminal part of Jun, which contains the activating domain, is responsible for the repression as shown by using Jun-Gal4 chimera. Jun likely exerts its negative control on the AFP promoter via protein-protein interactions with a not yet identified trans-activating factor within the −134 to +6 region or with a component of the general machinery of transcription. Jun proteins can thus be key intermediates in regulatory cascades which result in the differential modulation of the AFP and albumin gene expression in the course of liver development and carcinogenesis."

After template-primer (T·P) binds to free enzyme, the deoxynucleoside triphosphate to be incorporated binds to the RT and T·P binary complex (RTT·P). After incorporation of the bound nucleotide, catalytic cycling is limited either by a conformational change (for processive synthesis) or release of the enzyme from the extended T·P (for single-nucleotide incorporation). To explore cycling through these alternate rate-limiting steps, we determined kinetic parameters for single-nucleotide incorporation by HXB2R HIV-1 RT with chain-terminating nucleotide substrates 3′-azido-3′-deoxythymidine triphosphate (AZTTP) and dideoxythymidine triphosphate on a homopolymeric T·P system, poly(rA)-oligo(dT)16. Inhibition of processive deoxythymidine monophosphate incorporation by these chain-terminating substrates was also examined. Because AZTTP is a substrate, its Kmshould be equivalent to Ki, and since Kmfor AZTTP should be influenced by the dissociation rate constant for RTT·P, we examined the effect of altering RTT·Pdissociation on AZTTP kinetic parameters. The dissociation rate constant was modulated by making use of different T·P substrates, viral sources of RT, and a mutant RT altered at a residue that perturbs T·P binding.As expected from earlier work, the time course of AZTMP incorporation on poly(rA)-oligo(dT)16was biphasic, with a burst followed by a slower steady-state phase representing kcat(0.42 min−1) which was similar to the rate constant for RTT·Pdissociation. Additionally, Kmfor AZTTP (110 nM) was lower than its equilibrium dissociation constant (1200 nM). AZTTP inhibition (KiAZTTP) of processive dTMP incorporation and incorporation of a single nucleotide were similar. However, a simple correlation between the RTT·Pdissociation rate constant and KiAZTTPwas not observed. These results indicate that a simple ordered model for single-nucleotide incorporation is inadequate and that different forms of RTT·Pexist which can limit catalysis.

A. 1994; 91: 1839-1842Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar), and evidence has been presented that LRP mediates the uptake of tissue factor pathway inhibitor (17Warshawsky I. Broze G.J. Schwartz A.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 6664-6668Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Purification of LRP has revealed the existence of a receptor-associated protein (RAP), capable of inhibiting the binding of all known ligands to the receptor (14Willnow T.E. Goldstein J.L. Orth K. Brown M.S. Herz J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 26172-26180Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Strickland D.K. Ashcom J.D. Williams S. Battey F. Behre E. McTigue K. Battey J.F. Argraves W.S.

Chem. 1991; 266: 21232-21238Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).The structural basis underlying the high affinity interaction of such a multitude of functionally diverse ligands to the receptor is only poorly understood. Moestrup et al.(21Moestrup S.K. Holtet T.L. Etzerodt M. Th H.C. Nykj A. Andreasen P.A. Rasmussen H.H. Sottrup-Jensen L. Gliemann J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13691-13696Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) demonstrated by ligand blot analysis that rat α1-macroglobulin and u-PA·PAI-1 complexes bind to specific distinct binding sites located in a CNBr-generated 75-kDa fragment (amino acids 776-1399) containing the second cluster of complement-type repeats (cluster II domain) flanked by one amino-terminal and two carboxyl-terminal cysteine-rich epidermal growth factor type repeats. RAP was also shown to bind to the fragment and to inhibit the binding of both ligands to the receptor. Using a recombinant DNA approach to express functionally restricted LRP minireceptors, Willnow et al.(22Willnow T.E. Orth K. Herz J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15827-15832Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) demonstrated that RAP has a minor affinity for the fourth cluster of complement-type repeats. The binding sites for other ligands on LRP have not been identified yet.To understand the structure and function relations of LRP, we aim to delineate the structural determinants that constitute the ligand-binding sites of the receptor. The present study was performed to obtain monoclonal antibodies specifically directed toward ligand-binding domains of the receptor. The interaction of all known ligands to LRP is dependent on the binding of Ca2+ to the receptor, and it has been postulated that Ca2+ may induce allosteric changes that are required to expose the ligand-binding sites (23Moestrup S.K. Kaltoft K. Sottrup-Jensen L. Gliemann J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 12623-12628Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Hence, we used a strategy for selection of anti-LRP antibodies directed against Ca2+-dependent epitopes.Combinatorial immunoglobulin repertoire cloning is a technique that allows the selection of specific Fab fragments from large, phage-displayed Fab fragment libraries (24Kang A.S. Barbas C.F. Janda K.D. Benkovic S.J. Lerner R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 4363-4366Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar). We have employed this technique and constructed a phage library displaying Fab portions derived from the IgG repertoire of a mouse that had been immunized with purified human LRP.Here we report the isolation of a Fab fragment (Fab A8) that mimics a LRP ligand. It binds in a Ca2+-dependent manner with high affinity to immobilized purified LRP and competes partially for binding of u-PA·PAI-1 complexes and completely for binding of pro-u-PA to the receptor.MATERIALS AND METHODSProteins and ChemicalsHuman LRP, α2M˙, and monoclonal antibodies α2MRα-5 (IgM) and α2MRβ-1 (IgG) were purified as described (19Moestrup S.K.

Recombinant RAP was provided by Dr. H. C. Th(University of Aarhus). LpL was from Sigma, human two-chain u-PA was from Serono (Anbonne, Switzerland), two-chain t-PA was from Biopool (Umea, Sweden), and active PAI-1 was a gift from Dr. T. M. Reilly (Merck Laboratories). Pro-u-PA was a gift from Dr. J. Henkin (Abbott). Proteins were radiolabeled by using the IODO-GEN method (Pierce). Na125I was from the Radiochemical Centre. Specific activities were 1-4 × 1016 Bq/mol of ligand. Complexes between PAI-1 and [125I]u-PA or [125I]t-PA were prepared as described (27Jensen P.H. Christensen E.I. Ebbesen P. Gliemann J. Andreasen P.A. Cell Regul. 1990; 1: 1043-1056Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). All other chemicals used were reagent grade (Sigma).Construction of a Phage-displayed Fab LibraryA Balb/C mouse was immunized with purified human LRP. To that end, the mouse was injected intraperitoneally three times during a period of 6 weeks with 10 μg of purified LRP diluted 1:1 in either complete or incomplete Freund's adjuvant. After the third boost anti-LRP immunoglobulin serum titers were checked by fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis of COS-1 cells derived from African green monkey kidney (ATCC CRL 1650). After a final intravenous boost, the mouse was sacrificed, and the spleen was isolated. Total RNA was isolated according to the method of Chomczynski and Sacchi (28Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (62983) Google Scholar). Single-stranded cDNA was prepared using RNase H- reverse transcriptase (Superscript II, Life Technologies, Inc.). The construction of phage-displayed Fab libraries has been described in detail (29Kang A.S. Burton D.R. Lerner R.A.

Briefly, specific amplification of cDNAs encoding the Fd portions of IgG1 and IgG2a and κ light chains was accomplished by polymerase chain reaction using a set of specific primers. Polymerase chain reaction products were subsequently cloned into phagemid pComb3. After transformation of Escherichia coli strain XL1-Blue and infection with VCSM13 helper phages (Stratagene), a phage-displayed Fab library was obtained that consisted of 1.8 × 10× independent colonies.DNA Sequence AnalysisSequencing of DNA, encoding the CDR3 regions of Fab heavy chains, was performed using the Sequenase 2.0 sequencing kit (U. S. Biochemical Corp.).Panning of the Phage-displayed Fab LibrarySelection of LRP-binding Fab phages was performed in a biopanning assay as described by Burton et al.(25Burton D.R. Barbas C.F. Persson M.A.A. Koenig S. Chanock R.M. Lerner R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 10134-10137Crossref PubMed Scopus (603) Google Scholar). Briefly, 1 μg of LRP was coated for 16 h at 4°C onto wells of microtiter plates (enzyme immunoassay/radioimmunoassay plates, Costar), and unbound protein was washed away using Tris-buffered saline (TBS) (20 mM Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl). Wells were blocked with TBS, 3% (w/v) BSA for 1 h at 37°C, and wells were washed once with TBS. 1010 Fab phages were incubated in TBS, 1% (w/v) BSA at 37°C for 2 h. After extensive washing with TBS, 0.05% (v/v) Tween 20, bound Fab phages were eluted with TBS, 10 mM EDTA. Suspensions of eluted phages were reamplified in E. coli. Panning procedures were repeated 3 times.Screening of the Phage-displayed Fab Library by Phage ELISASmall scale phage preparations (109 plaque-forming units/μl) obtained from single colonies of the subsequent rounds of selection were analyzed for binding to immobilized LRP by phage ELISA (31Horn I.R. Van den Berg B.M.M. Moestrup S.K. van Zonneveld A.J. Leukocyte Typing V. Oxford University Press, Oxford, in press1995Google Scholar). Briefly, 1010 phages were incubated for 2 h at 37°C on coated LRP or BSA in a final volume of 50 μl of TBS, 1% (w/v) BSA in the presence or absence of EDTA as indicated. Bound Fab phages were detected by incubation with polyclonal anti-M13 biotin conjugate (5 Prime → 3 Prime, Inc.) followed by incubation with horseradish peroxidase-coupled streptavidin (Amersham Corp.) and staining with tetramethylbenzidine. Extinction was measured at 450 nm.Preparation of Soluble FabPreparation of soluble Fab was performed as described (30Barbas C.F. Kang A.S. Lerner R.A. Benkovic S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 7978-7982Crossref PubMed Scopus (1024) Google Scholar). Briefly, the DNA coding for the M13 gene III product was deleted by subcloning allowing for the expression of soluble Fab in the periplasmic space of E. coli and subsequent purification from the culture supernatant. The culture supernatant was centrifuged for 1 h at 4°C at 10,000 rpm and filtered using 0.22-μm filters (Schleicher & Schuell, Inc.). Subsequently, the Fab fragment was purified from the supernatant to homogeneity by affinity chromatography using a Sepharose-coupled rat anti-mouse Ig κ light chain monoclonal antibody (CLB, Amsterdam, The Netherlands). The Fab fragment preparation was essentially pure when analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis combined with silver staining. Purification procedures yielded approximately 2 mg of Fab protein/liter of E. coli culture supernatant, as determined by measuring extinction at 280 nm.Determination of Relative Affinities of Antibodies by Competitive ELISAThe relative affinities of the Fab fragments were determined as described previously (32Rath S. Stanley C.M. Steward M.W. J. Immunol. Methods. 1988; 106: 245-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 33Andersson B. J. Exp. Med. 1970; 132: 77-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). 50 ng of LRP was coated for 1 h at 37°C onto 96-well ELISA plates (NUNC), blocked with TBS, 3% (w/v) BSA, and incubated with serial dilutions of the selected antibodies to establish the antibody concentrations that result in half-maximal binding. These concentrations were then used in a competitive ELISA in which the binding of the antibody to immobilized LRP was competed with a range of soluble LRP concentrations. After an incubation period of 1 h at 37°C, plates were washed, and bound Fab fragments were detected as described above using rat anti-mouse κ light chain antibodies coupled to biotin. The relative affinities were estimated from the concentrations of soluble LRP that give a half-maximal inhibition.Competition for Fab Binding to Purified LRP by RAP or LpLConditions were essentially as described for the competitive ELISA. Competition for Fab binding to LRP was investigated by adding increasing amounts of RAP or LpL. Residual Fab binding was measured as described above.Immunoblotting of CNBr-digested LRPLRP digested with CNBr was separated on a SDS-polyacrylamide gel (4-16%; nonreducing conditions) and electroblotted onto Immobilon filters as described (21Moestrup S.K. Holtet T.L. Etzerodt M. Th H.C. Nykj A. Andreasen P.A. Rasmussen H.H. Sottrup-Jensen L. Gliemann J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13691-13696Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Immunostaining was performed using IgM α2MRα-5, polyclonal rabbit anti-human LRP serum, and Fab fragment Fab A8. As secondary antibodies, rat polyclonal anti-mouse κ light chain antibodies coupled to biotin and polyclonal goat anti-rabbit antibodies coupled to alkaline phosphatase (Promega) were used. Staining was performed using 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate and nitro blue tetrazolium chloride (Promega).Ligand Binding to Purified LRPAssays were essentially as described (3Nykj A. Petersen C.M.M.B. Jensen P.H. Moestrup S.K. Holtet T.L. Etzerodt M. Th H.C. Munch M. Andreasen P.A. Gliemann J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 14543-14546Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Incubations were performed with 125I-labeled methylamine-activated α2-macroglobulin (α2M˙), t-PA·PAI-1 complexes, u-PA·PAI-1 complexes, or pro-u-PA for 16 h at 4°C in Hepes buffer (140 mM NaCl, 10 mM Hepes, 2 mM CaCl2, 1 mM MgCl2, 2% (w/v) BSA, pH 7.8) in the presence of a range of Fab A8 concentrations. After washing, bound radioactivity was removed with 10% (w/v) SDS and counted. Values were corrected for binding to BSA-coated wells.Inhibition of Ligand Degradation by COS-1 CellsCOS-1 cells were seeded in 6-well plates (NUNC) and grown to confluency in Iscove's modified medium containing 5% (v/v) fetal calf serum (Life Technologies, Inc.), penicillin, streptomycin, and Fungizone for at least 24 h prior to incubations. Ligand degradation experiments were performed as follows. Cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and binding medium (Iscove's medium supplemented with 0.01% (v/v) Tween 20, 1 mM CaCl2, 1 mM MgCl2, 50 mM ϵ-aminocaproic acid, 0.02% (w/v) sodium azide) and incubated for 2 h at 37°C with 0.4 nM [125I]u-PA·PAI-1 complexes or 3 nM [125I]t-PA·PAI-1 complexes in binding medium, in either the presence or the absence of 1 μM Fab fragment or 1 μM RAP. After incubation, proteins present in the cell culture supernatant were precipitated using 10% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid/phosphate-buffered saline, supplemented with 0.5% (w/v) KI. Nonprecipitable radioactivity was determined in a γ counter.RESULTSSelection of Anti-LRP Fab Phages Directed toward Ca2+-dependent EpitopesLRP-binding Fab phages were selected from a phage-displayed Fab library by a panning assay using immobilized LRP and elution of bound Fab phages with EDTA. After four rounds of panning, individual phage stocks were prepared and screened in a phage ELISA (Fig. 1). Fab phage isolates from the first and second round of panning did not show any specific binding to LRP. One Fab phage out of 10 isolated from the third round of panning specifically bound to LRP, and binding was completely abolished in the presence of 5 mM EDTA. This Fab phage did not show any binding to coated BSA in either the presence or the absence of 5 mM EDTA. All Fab phage isolates from the fourth round of panning specifically bound to LRP, whereas no binding was observed either to coated LRP in the presence of 5 mM EDTA or to coated BSA in both the presence and the absence of EDTA. These results show that we selected Fab phages that bind to LRP exclusively when divalent cations (Ca2+) are present.The phagemid DNA-encoding CDR3 regions of heavy chains of all LRP-binding Fab phages were sequenced and were found to be identical, indicating the selection of a single type of Fab phage, denoted Fab A8. Upon comparison, no apparent homology was observed between the Fab A8 heavy chain CDR3 region (YPFWPYH) and the primary structure of LRP ligands apoE, LpL, PAI-1, pro-u-PA, and RAP.Determination of Relative Affinities of Fab FragmentsTo further characterize the properties of the selected Fab A8, the Fab A8 phagemid DNA was modified for expression of soluble Fab fragment, and Fab A8 was purified from E. coli supernatant by affinity chromatography. Relative affinities of Fab fragments were determined by performing a competitive ELISA (32Rath S. Stanley C.M. Steward M.W. J. Immunol. Methods. 1988; 106: 245-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). In these experiments, Fab A8 was compared with a Fab fragment (Fab A2) that recognizes LRP in a Ca2+-independent way. Fab A2 (CDR3 region YDFNTSTGYY) was taken from a panel of anti-LRP Fab fragments obtained by a panning procedure in which bound Fab phages were eluted using glycine HCl (pH 2.2). A competitive ELISA was performed using a constant amount of coated LRP (50 ng) and a range of soluble LRP (10−11-10−7M) (Fig. 2). Relative affinities (corresponding to IC50 values) were 2.8 and 0.62 nM for Fab A2 and A8, respectively. These values were comparable with the relative affinity of an anti-LRP monoclonal antibody obtained by classical hybridoma technology (α2MRβ-1, 5.6 nM, data not shown).Figure 2:Determination of relative affinities of Fab A2 and A8 by competitive ELISA. Microtiter wells were coated with 50 ng of LRP and incubated with half-maximal saturating amounts of Fab A2 or A8. Incubations with a range of soluble LRP concentrations were performed to determine 50% inhibition values, representing relative affinities of the Fab fragments. Detection was performed using a rat anti-mouse κ light chain monoclonal antibody coupled to biotin. ▲, Fab A2; ●, Fab A8. Experiments were performed in triplicate.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Binding of Fab A8 to LRP Is Inhibited by RAP and LpLBecause binding of all ligands to LRP is Ca2+-dependent and can be prevented by RAP, the binding of Fab A8 to LRP was tested for inhibition by RAP (Fig. 3). LpL has been found to compete for the binding of RAP to LRP (34Williams S.E. Inoue I. Tran H. Fry G.L. Pladet M.W. Iverius P.-H. Lalouel J.-M. Chappell D.A. Strickland D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8653-8658Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore we tested the inhibition of Fab fragment binding by LpL. Whereas binding of Fab A2 is not prevented by RAP and LpL over a concentration range of 10−11-10−7M, the binding of Fab A8 is completely inhibited upon addition of RAP (IC50 = 1.4 nM) or LpL (IC50 = 31 nM). In a control experiment, no direct binding of Fab A8 to immobilized RAP or LpL was observed.Figure 3:Effects of RAP and LpL on the binding of Fab A2 or A8 to immobilized LRP. The binding of Fab A2 and Fab A8 to 50 ng of immobilized LRP was determined in an ELISA as described under “Materials and Methods” in the presence of increasing amounts of RAP or LpL as indicated. ○ and □, Fab A2 in the presence of RAP and LpL, respectively; ● and ■, Fab A8 in the presence of RAP and LpL, respectively.

Holtet T.L. Etzerodt M. Th H.C. Nykj A. Andreasen P.A. Rasmussen H.H. Sottrup-Jensen L. Gliemann J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13691-13696Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We have used the same approach to localize the epitope of Fab A8 on LRP. As can be seen in Fig. 4, no bands were stained upon incubation without primary antibodies (lane 1), whereas incubation with polyclonal rabbit anti-LRP serum visualized a subset of the CNBr-derived LRP fragments (lane 2). The monoclonal IgM antibody α2MRα-5 has been shown to bind to an epitope located between residues 1165 and 1246 of the receptor (21Moestrup S.K. Holtet T.L. Etzerodt M. Th H.C. Nykj A. Andreasen P.A. Rasmussen H.H. Sottrup-Jensen L. Gliemann J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13691-13696Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This region is contained within a CNBr-derived fragment of 624 residues (amino acids 776-1399) that spans the second cluster of complement-type repeats. Lane 3 shows the immunostaining of this fragment (indicated by the arrow) by monoclonal antibody α2MRα-5. The higher molecular mass immunoreactive band (±80 kDa) is due to incomplete cleavage at the Met1399-Ser1400 bond (21Moestrup S.K. Holtet T.L. Etzerodt M. Th H.C. Nykj A. Andreasen P.A. Rasmussen H.H. Sottrup-Jensen L. Gliemann J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13691-13696Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Fab A8 recognizes the same pattern of bands as α2MRα-5 (lane 4). These results demonstrate that Fab A8 also binds to an epitope associated with the second cluster of cysteine-rich repeats in LRP.Figure 4:Immunostaining of CNBr-digested LRP. Immobilon filters with protein digests were blocked with TBS, 3% (w/v) BSA and subsequently incubated either without antibodies (lane 1) or with polyclonal rabbit anti-LRP serum (lane 2), IgM α2MRα-5 (lane 3), or Fab A8 (lane 4). The arrow indicates the mobility of a 75-kDa CNBr-derived fragment (amino acids 776-1399) that harbors the second cluster of complement-type repeats. Staining was performed using goat anti-rabbit polyclonal antibodies conjugated to alkaline phosphatase or using monoclonal rat anti-mouse κ light chain biotin conjugate.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Fab A8 Competes for the Binding of u-PA·PAI-1 Complexes and pro-u-PA to Immobilized LRPThe immunoblotting experiments showed that binding of Fab A8 to LRP is mediated by the fragment that carries ligand-binding sites for α2M˙, u-PA·PAI-1 complexes, and RAP. To test whether Fab A8 might compete for the binding of these ligands to the receptor, immobilized LRP was incubated with 125I-labeled ligands. Fig. 5 shows that Fab A8 has no effect on the binding of [125I]α2M˙ and on the binding of [125I]t-PA·PAI-1 complexes to immobilized purified LRP, whereas it partially blocks the binding of [125I]u-PA·PAI-1 complexes to the receptor (IC50 = 2.2 nM). The binding of [125I]pro-u-PA is completely prevented by Fab A8 (IC50 = 1.1 nM).Figure 5:Fab A8 inhibition of binding of [125I]u-PA·PAI-1 complexes and [125I]pro-u-PA to LRP.

The reversal potentials measured in KCl gradients indicate that this channel is weakly anion selective (PCl/ PK= 1.6 ± 0.2). The gating mechanism of the pore is voltage dependent. The channel shifts from a fully open state to a substate at positive electrical potentials and remains closed at negative electrical potentials. Succinylation of the protein increases the open probability of the fully open state and reverses the channel selectivity. Analysis of the single-channel conductance as a function of the salt concentration and of the open probability at various voltages suggests that this channel is a new membrane porin not previously identified.

The exchange of solutes between the stroma of the chloroplast and the cytoplasm proceeds through the envelope made of the inner and the outer membrane. The outer envelope membrane of intact chloroplasts has been shown to be freely permeable to molecules of several kDa (1Heldt H.W. Sauer F. Biochim. Biophys Acta. 1971; 234: 83-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). A pore-like channel has been identified in the outer envelope membrane of spinach chloroplast after detergent-solubilized membranes were fused with planar lipid bilayers.

(in 100 mM KCl) was assumed to be responsible for the high permeability of this membrane (2Flügge U.I. Benz R. FEBS Lett. 1984; 169: 85-89Crossref Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Three other channels have been identified in the outer membrane of giant chloroplasts of Nitella (3Pottosin I.I. FEBS Lett. 1992; 308: 87-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) : two are cation selective channels with a conductance of 520 and 1 nS (in 100 mM KCl) and one 160 pS channel is anion selective. The voltage dependence and the conductance of the three large channels are similar to that of the mitochondrial porin, also called the voltage-dependent anion channel of the mitochondrial outer membrane (VDAC) (4Colombini M.

The inner envelope membrane of chloroplasts is much more selective; it contains a H+-ATPase (5Douce R. Joyard J. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1990; 6: 173-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar) and several specific carrier proteins. Two of them have been purified: the phosphate translocator (6Flügge U.I. Weber A. Fischer K. Loddenkötter B. Wallmeier H. Research in Photosynthesis. Vol. III. Kluwer Academic Publishers, The Netherlands1992: 667-674Google Scholar) and the glycolate transporter (7Howitz K.T. McCarty R.E. Plant Physiol. 1991; 96: 1060-1069Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Little is known about ion channels in the inner envelope membrane. The pH gradient across the inner envelope membrane is thought to be regulated by an active extrusion of H+balanced by a passive counterflux through H+and K+channels (8Peters J.S. Berkowitz G.A. Plant Physiol. 1991; 95: 1229-1236Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 9Wang X.-C. Berkowitz G.A. Peters J.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 4981-4985Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). An inner envelope K+channel has been recently reconstituted into a planar lipid bilayer (10Feng M. Peters J.S. Berkowitz G.A. Plant Physiol. 1994; 105: 955-964Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). This channel could be involved in the pH regulation of the stroma. An anionic flux through the inner envelope membrane was also detected from swelling studies (11Heber U. Heldt H.W. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. 1981; 32: 139-168Crossref Google Scholar) and tracer flux experiments (12Demmig B. Gimmler H. Plant Physiol. 1983; 73: 169-174Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) done with intact chloroplastic suspensions. The chloride transporter could be the phosphate translocator, which can also work as an anion channel (13Schwarz M. Gross A. Steinkamp T. Flügge U.I. Wagner R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29481-29489Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We describe here the molecular properties of a new porin-like channel that was detected after fusion of the inner envelope membrane of chloroplasts with a planar lipid bilayer. Inner envelope membranes of chloroplast were purified from Spinacia oleracia by step-gradient centrifugation as described by Keegstra and Yousif (14Keegstra K. Yousif A.E. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 118: 316-325Crossref Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Spinach leaves were purchased from a local market. About 500 g were homogenized with a Waring blender in 1 liter of grinding medium (GM) (0.33 M sorbitol, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM MgCl2, 50 mM Tricine-KOH, pH 7.8, and 0.1% bovine serum albumin). All operations were carried out at 4°C in a cold room. The mixture was filtered through eight layers of cheese cloth and one layer of cotton wool, and then 4 × 250 ml were centrifuged at 2,500 × g for 2 min (Sorvall GSA rotor). The pellet was collected, resuspended in 2 × 10 ml of GM, and layered over 2 × 15 ml of 40% (v/v) Percoll (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) in GM. The two tubes were centrifuged at 2,000 × g for 2.5 min and then brought to rest without braking (Heraeus, swinging buckets). The broken chloroplasts and contaminant organelles that formed a band above the pellet were discarded. Purified intact chloroplasts were recovered at the bottom of the tube and washed two times in GM without bovine serum albumin at 2,700 × g for 7 min (Sigma centrifuge). The integrity of the chloroplasts was higher than 95%, as determined with a Clark-type oxygen electrode (15Walker D.A. Cerovic Z.G. Robinson S.P. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 148: 145-157Crossref Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Organelles (25 mg of chlorophyll) were resuspended in hypertonic medium (0.6 M sucrose, 2 mM EDTA, and 10 mM Tricine-KOH (pH 7.8)) and were incubated on ice for 15-20 min at 1 mg/ml chlorophyll. Then, inner and outer envelopes were detached by 30 strokes with a Dounce homogeneizer. The mixture was diluted with two volumes of 2 mM EDTA and 10 mM Tricine-KOH (pH 7.8) to give 0.2 M sucrose (final). Thylakoids and whole intact chloroplasts were removed by a centrifugation at 6,000 × g for 10 min (Sorvall SS34 rotor). The yellow supernatant was collected and pelleted at 40,000 × g for 30 min (Sorvall SS34 rotor) to obtain the crude envelope. The pellet was suspended in 2 × 20 ml of 0.2 M sucrose, 2 mM EDTA, and 10 mM Tricine-KOH (pH 7.8) and layered on the top of a discontinuous sucrose gradient (0.46 M (1.06 g/ml), 0.8 M (1.10 g/ml), and 1 M sucrose (1.13 g/ml)) in 2 mM EDTA, 10 mM Tricine-KOH (pH 7.8) and centrifuged at 120,000 × g overnight (Beckman SW27 rotor). Outer and inner envelope fractions formed two bands, which were recovered separately at the second and third interfaces of the sucrose gradient, respectively. The outer and inner envelopes were diluted four times with 2 mM EDTA, 10 mM Tricine-KOH (pH 7.8) and were collected after a centrifugation of 125,000 × g for 90 min (Beckmann SW27 rotor). The two pellets were resuspended with a Dounce homogeneizer in GM. The absence of cytochrome c oxidase activity and chlorophyll indicated that there was no detectable contamination by mitochondrial membranes and thylakoids. Small aliquots were stored at −70°C. Intact chloroplasts equivalent to 1 mg of chlorophyll yielded about 10 μg of inner envelope proteins and about 5 μg of outer envelope proteins. The experiments reported in this paper were carried out using five batches of membrane purified during one year. Planar lipid membranes were formed using the Mueller-Rudin technique (16Fuks B. Homblé F. Biophys. J. 1994; 66: 1404-1414Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) from a binary mixture of POPE/POPS (7:3 (w/w), Avanti Polar Lipids, AL) dissolved in n-decane. Experiments were performed at room temperature. All solutions of triple distilled water were millipore filtered. The two chambers were connected to the voltage generator through Ag/AgCl electrodes and a bridge of 3 M KCl, 2% agar. The current was measured using a Biologic RK-300 patch-clamp amplifier (Claix, France) and stored in a digital form on a videotape. The data were filtered with a low-pass 5-pole Tchebicheff filter at a cut-off frequency of 300 Hz. Acquired data were subsequently replayed, and the relevent events were sampled at 1 kHz and stored in a 386-Olivetti computer. Electrical potentials were defined as cis with respect to trans, which was held at ground. The amplitude of the single-channel current was determined from total amplitude histograms fitted with Gaussian functions. The open probability of the fully open state (PO) was calculated according to the equation (17Bertl A. Slayman C.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 7824-7828Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) PO= (1/ Nc)Σi Pi, where Σiis the summation index from 0 to Nc, Piis the fraction of time during which a channel opens, and Ncis the total number of channels in the planar lipid bilayer. In the absence of a substate, the channel behaves like a two-state channel. In this case, the open probability was estimated from records containing one or two channels. In contrast, in the presence of the substate, the open probability of the fully open state and the open probability of the substate were estimated from the fraction of time spent in the fully open state or in the substate. In this case, experiments containing only one channel were used for the analysis. An aliquot of the inner envelope (5-10 μg of proteins) was sonicated for 20 s and added to the cis chamber under continuous stirring. Fusion of vesicles required a large osmotic gradient across the bilayer (cis side: 150 mM KCl, 5 mM CaCl2, 10 mM Hepes-KOH, pH 7.2; trans side: 10 mM Hepes-KOH, pH 7.2) and an electrical potential of +60 mV across the bilayer. After fusion, an aliquot of 3 M KCl was added in the trans side (150 mM KCl, final concentration). The conductivity of the experimental salt solution was measured using a Philips digital conductivity meter. In the text, data are expressed as mean ± S.E. with the number of experiments in brackets. Statistical significance refers to a Student's t test (p < 0.05). Succinic anhydride (Sigma) was added from a stock solution of dimethyl sulfoxide to both cis and trans compartments to a final concentration of 3.8 mM. The compartments were stirred during 30 s, and measurements were performed after waiting for 5 min of incubation for a complete hydrolysis of succinic anhydride (the anhydride half-life is about 2 min). No electrical potential was applied across the bilayer during the incubation of the ion channel with succinic anhydride. Control experiments showed that the conductances of pure lipid bilayers were not modified by Me2SO alone or 3.8 mM succinic anhydride, but addition of higher concentration of anhydride destabilized the planar bilayer. We used a 150 mM KCl solution buffered with 50 mM MOPS-KOH, pH 7.2, to prevent a pH decrease during hydrolysis of succinic anhydride, which could affect the anhydride reaction with amino groups (18Klotz I.M. Methods Enzymol. 1967; 11: 576-580Crossref Scopus (187) Google Scholar). In experiments carried out in a 1 M, 0.1 M KCl gradient, no succinic anhydride was added in the low salt compartment (the trans side) to minimize increase of salt buffer due to the presence of MOPS. Dextran sulfate (8 kDa) (Sigma) was added to both compartments under continuous stirring for 1 min. Two concentrations were used: 6.3 and 31 μM (final concentrations). At each dextran concentration, various voltages were applied to determine the channel conductance and the open probability. Isolated inner envelope membrane of chloroplasts are incorporated into a planar lipid bilayer separating two aqueous solutions. After addition of membrane vesicles to the cis side of the planar lipid bilayer and stirring for a maximum of 30 min, we sometimes observed a discrete jump of currents in the electrical record reflecting fusion between a vesicle containing one channel and the planar bilayer. Channels were successfully reconstituted in about 20% out of the trials. One channel of large conductance was reliably observed in planar bilayers enriched with the inner envelope. This channel was detected in 63 out of 84 successful reconstitutions of the inner envelope fractions. It is quite specific of the inner envelope and was never observed when the reconstitution was carried out with the thylakoids (n > 50) or the outer envelope fraction (n > 20). The channel remained mainly closed at negative potentials (Fig. 1). At positive potentials, the channel opened more frequently. Besides the transition between a fully open and a fully closed state, the channel shifted from its open state to a substate at +50 and +60 mV. Fig. 2 A shows the I-V relationship of the fully open state in symmetrical 150 mM KCl. A slope conductance of 525 ± 12 pS (n = 26) is calculated between ±40 mV from the linear regression of the ohmic part of the curve. The current characterizing the substate is about half that the maximum opening (Fig. 2 B). The use of different lipid composition such as POPE, POPE/palmitoyloleoyl phosphatidylcholine (1:1, w/w), diphytanoyl phosphatidylcholine, or azolectin has no effect on both frequency of reconstitution and conductance of the channel. The electrical properties of the 525-pS channel measured in the presence of divalent cation in the cis compartment (5 mM Ca2+or 5 mM Mg2+) were not affected by the presence or the absence of 10 mM EGTA. The ratio of the permeability coefficient of chloride ions to that of potassium ions is calculated from the reversal potential using the Goldman-Hodgkin-Katz equation. The reversal potentials measured in three different cis/trans gradients of 450/150 mM KCl, 150/400 mM KCl, and 1000/150 mM KCl are +5.6 ± 1.6 mV (n = 4), −3.9 mV (n = 2), and +8.5 mV (n = 1), respectively (Fig. 3). The selectivity of Cl−over K+in these gradients is 1.6 ± 0.2 (n = 7). Single-channel conductance is measured in symmetrical KCl concentrations ranging from 50 mM to 1 M. The I-V curves measured in salt concentrations of 1 M, 750 mM, and 500 mM KCl can be fitted by a linear relationship (Fig. 4 A). The linear regressions give single-channel conductances of 2.1, 1.7, and 1.2 nS, respectively. At lower salt concentrations (50 and 100 mM KCl), the slope conductances calculated between −40 and +40 mV are 168 and 349 pS, respectively (Fig. 4 B). Large channels called porin form water-filled pores across the membrane through which small solutes can diffuse (19Benz R. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1988; 42: 359-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar, 20Colombini M. J. Membr. Biol. 1989; 111: 103-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar, 21Sorgato M.C. Moran O. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1993; 18: 127-171Crossref Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 22Benz R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1197: 167-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar). Their single-channel conductance increases linearly with the solute concentration. This characteristic is also shared by the 525-pS channel whose single-channel conductance is found to be a linear function of the conductivity of the aqueous solution (Fig. 4 C). The study of the voltage dependence is performed in symmetrical 150 mM KCl, 10 mM Hepes-KOH (pH 7.2). Fig. 5A illustrates the open probability of the fully open state at various voltages compiled from 13 bilayers. The channel exhibits an open probability of about 0.2 at voltages ranging from +15 to +60 mV. The slight decrease of the open probability observed after +60 mV is not statistically significant. At negative potentials, the open probability decreases to zero. The open probability of the substate is shown in Fig. 5 B. The substate becomes a long-lived state after +40 mV. The open probabilities of the substate calculated at +40 and +60 mV are statistically different. To investigate the gating process of the channel, we used succinic anhydride to convert a positive amino group into a negative carboxyl group (18Klotz I.M. Methods Enzymol. 1967; 11: 576-580Crossref Scopus (187) Google Scholar). The bilayer lipid membrane is formed in a symmetrical 150 mM KCl solution, and succinic anhydride (3.8 mM, final concentration) is added on each side of the membrane. 5 min after addition of succinic anhydride, the channel is in its open state and closes only on rare occasions when the membrane is polarized at −30 mV (Fig. 6 A). When a positive membrane potential difference of +50 mV is applied, the modified channel remains in the open state for few seconds and afterward completely closes (Fig. 6 A). Fig. 6 B summarizes the open probabilities of the fully open state measured before and after succinylation of the channel. At electrical potential differences ranging from −70 to +40 mV, the open probability reaches the maximum (PO= 1). But at electrical potentials higher than +40 mV, the open probability decreases because the channel shifts either to the substate or to the fully closed state. The succinylation does not seem to change the structure of the pore since the conductance is not affected by the chemical treatment. To measure the effect of succinic anhydride on the ion selectivity of the channel, we have reconstituted ion channels in planar bilayers in the presence of a salt gradient of 1000/100 mM KCl (cis/trans). The I-V relationship is recorded before and after addition of succinic anhydride (3.8 mM) to the cis side. The reversal potential shifts from +8.4 mV (n = 2) to −8.9 mV (n = 2) when the channel is succinylated (Fig. 7), which indicates that succinylation of the channel changes its selectivity. The anionic channel becomes cationic with a selectivity for K+over Cl−of 0.67 instead of 1.6 calculated for the unmodified channel. Dextran sulfate is a large impermeant polyvalent anion (8 kDa) known to decrease the open probability of the mitochondrial VDAC at a concentration of 6 μM(23Mangan P.S. Colombini M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 4896-4900Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). To test if dextran sulfate is a potent inhibitor of the 525-pS channel, it was added on each side of the bilayer (6.3 and 31 μM, final concentrations). Neither the voltage dependence nor the conductance of the 525-pS channel were modified whatever the concentration used (data not shown). Each experiment was repeated four times. We have incorporated a large conductance (525 pS) channel from the inner envelope membrane of the chloroplast in a planar lipid bilayer. To our knowledge, it is the first time that a porin is characterized in the inner envelope of the chloroplast. Like other porin found in the outer membrane of bacteria, chloroplasts, and mitochondria, the 525-pS channel has a large conductance, which increases linearly with salt concentrations (Fig. 4). Moreover, it is weakly anion selective (Fig. 3). Despite these two similarities, the 525-pS porin is different from that found in the outer membrane of chloroplasts and mitochondria. The large conductance channels of the outer envelope membrane of chloroplasts of Nitella are cation selective (PK/ PCl= 4.6 and 3.5) (3Pottosin I.I. FEBS Lett. 1992; 308: 87-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), and that of spinach chloroplast has a conductance of 7 nS in 1 M KCl, which is one of the largest conductances of all known porins (2Flügge U.I. Benz R. FEBS Lett. 1984; 169: 85-89Crossref Scopus (100) Google Scholar). The probability that the 525-pS channel observed in the inner envelope fraction could be a contamination from the thylakoid membrane or from the outer envelope is very weak. Indeed, the electrical signal characterizing the 525-pS channel was never observed when the outer envelope membrane or the thylakoid membrane of the chloroplast was used instead of the inner envelope fraction. The VDAC found in the outer membrane of mitochondria also belong to the porin family (20Colombini M. J. Membr. Biol. 1989; 111: 103-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar, 21Sorgato M.C. Moran O. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1993; 18: 127-171Crossref Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 22Benz R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1197: 167-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar). Like the 525-pS channel, it is weakly anion selective and voltage dependent. However, our study provides evidence that there are at least five differences between the VDAC and the 525-pS channel. First, the single-channel conductance of 2.1 nS calculated in 1 M KCl is lower than the values reported for mitochondrial VDAC (3.7-4.5 nS). Second, the lifetime of the fully open state of the 525-pS channel is much shorter than that of the VDAC, which is estimated to be at least several seconds (20Colombini M. J. Membr. Biol. 1989; 111: 103-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar, 21Sorgato M.C. Moran O. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1993; 18: 127-171Crossref Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 22Benz R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1197: 167-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar). Third, the 525-pS channel exists in three stable conformations: a fully open state, a fully closed state, and a substate. Thus, the 525-pS channel closes to a nonconducting state, whereas the mitochondrial VDAC almost never closes completely and remains either in the fully open state or in the substate. Fourth, the polyanion dextran sulfate (6.3 and 31 μM) has no effect on the conductance and the gating of the 525-pS channel. In contrast, electrostatic interactions between dextran sulfate and the positive gating charges of the mitochondrial VDAC decrease its open probability (23Mangan P.S. Colombini M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 4896-4900Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Finally, the voltage gating of the 525-pS channel depends on the polarity (Fig. 5); the open probability of the fully open state is higher at positive voltages than at negative voltages, and the substate appears only at positive potentials whereas the open probability of the mitochondrial VDAC is identical whatever the sign of the electrical potential differences and follows a “bell-shaped” function. To investigate the gating process of the 525-pS channel, we performed chemical modifications of the channel with succinic anhydride. Succinylation of proteins is known to convert the positive groups of some amino acids into negative groups (18Klotz I.M. Methods Enzymol. 1967; 11: 576-580Crossref Scopus (187) Google Scholar). The walls within the pore are probably lined with such positive residues. When we modified the net charge of the pore by converting some of the positive amino acids into negative amino acids, the voltage gating was changed and the open probability of the channel was dramatically increased. However, it did not prevent the channel closure at high positive potentials. These results suggest either that the gating of the chloroplast porin is directly mediated by the positive charges distributed inside the pore or that succinylation of some positive residues just stabilizes the channel conformation in its fully open state. The conversion of charges also alters the ion selectivity of the channel. When the positive residues lining the pore are converted into negative residues then the local electrostatic force is modified, and the selectivity of the channel is reversed. These results agree with those observed in the bacterial porin PhoE and in the mitochondrial VDAC (19Benz R. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1988; 42: 359-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar, 24Adelsberger-Mangan D.M. Colombini M. J. Membr. Biol. 1987; 98: 157-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 25Blachly-Dyson E. Peng S. Colombini M. Forte M. Science. 1990; 247: 1233-1236Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar) and suggest that the positive residues form the filter lining of the pore. The occurrence of a porin channel in the inner envelope membrane of chloroplasts is surprising since such a large channel would dissipate the electrochemical gradient. It has been shown that the inward side of vesicles will, after fusion, face the solution bathing the trans compartment (26Cohen F.S. Miller C. Ion Channel Reconstitution. Plenum Press, New York1986: 131-139Crossref Google Scholar). Since the inner envelope vesicles are predominantly inside-out (27Cline K. Keegstra K. Staehelin L.A. Protoplasma. 1985; 125: 111-123Crossref Scopus (34) Google Scholar), the channels will have their stroma surface facing the cis side of the bilayer. Therefore, under physiological conditions, the channel should be mainly closed because the electrical potential of inner envelope membrane was measured to be about −100 mV (28Wu W. Peters J.S. Berkowitz G.A. Plant Physiol. 1991; 97: 580-587Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). It cannot be ruled out that the 525-pS channel might remain closed by soluble elements present in the chloroplast stroma or inter-envelope space. Large conductance channels involved either in pressure transduction or in import of proteins have been already observed in the inner membrane of mitochondria and bacteria (29Zoratti M. Petronilli V. FEBS Lett. 1988; 240: 105-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 30Berrier C. Coulombe A. Houssin C. Ghazi A.

A. 1989; 86: 6176-6180Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 32Simon S.M. Blobel G. Cell. 1992; 69: 677-684Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar, 33Kinally K.W.

Biol. 1993; 133: 119-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The reconstitutions of contact sites from brain mitochondria and Escherichia coli have shown that these membrane fractions contain several ion channels with a conductance ranging from 475 pS to 1 nS in 150 mM KCl (35Moran O. Sandri G. Panfili E. Stühmer W. Sorgato M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 908-913Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and from 300 pS to 1.5 nS in 100 mM KCl (30Berrier C. Coulombe A. Houssin C. Ghazi A. FEBS Lett. 1989; 259: 27-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). The exact mechanism of protein transport across the envelope membranes of chloroplasts is still unknown. It has been suggested that protein translocation proceeds via two distinct protein-conducting channels in the outer and in the inner envelope membranes (36Schnell D.J. Kessler F. Blobel G. Science. 1994; 266: 1007-1012Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). Therefore, an alternative explanation could be that the 525-pS channel is a component of the protein import machinery present in the inner envelope of chloroplasts.
