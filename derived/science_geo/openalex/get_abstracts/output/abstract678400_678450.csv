https://openalex.org/W3190969019,"Abstract Enhancing vaccine uptake is a critical public health challenge 1 . Overcoming vaccine hesitancy 2,3 and failure to follow through on vaccination intentions 3 requires effective communication strategies 3,4 . Here we present two sequential randomized controlled trials to test the effect of behavioural interventions on the uptake of COVID-19 vaccines. We designed text-based reminders that make vaccination salient and easy, and delivered them to participants drawn from a healthcare system one day (first randomized controlled trial) ( n = 93,354 participants; clinicaltrials number NCT04800965) and eight days (second randomized controlled trial) ( n = 67,092 individuals; clinicaltrials number NCT04801524) after they received a notification of vaccine eligibility. The first reminder boosted appointment and vaccination rates within the healthcare system by 6.07 (84%) and 3.57 (26%) percentage points, respectively; the second reminder increased those outcomes by 1.65 and 1.06 percentage points, respectively. The first reminder had a greater effect when it was designed to make participants feel ownership of the vaccine dose. However, we found no evidence that combining the first reminder with a video-based information intervention designed to address vaccine hesitancy heightened its effect. We performed online studies ( n = 3,181 participants) to examine vaccination intentions, which revealed patterns that diverged from those of the first randomized controlled trial; this underscores the importance of pilot-testing interventions in the field. Our findings inform the design of behavioural nudges for promoting health decisions 5 , and highlight the value of making vaccination easy and inducing feelings of ownership over vaccines."

Here we silenced a subset of neocortical layer 5 pyramidal and archicortical dentate gyrus granule cells in male mice by ablating SNAP25. This markedly increased wakefulness and reduced rebound of electroencephalographic slow-wave activity after sleep deprivation, suggesting a role for the cortex in both vigilance state control and sleep homeostasis."
https://openalex.org/W3187270259,"Subcellular compartmentalization of macromolecules increases flux and prevents inhibitory interactions to control biochemical reactions. Inspired by this functionality, we sought to build designer compartments that function as hubs to regulate the flow of information through cellular control systems. We report a synthetic membraneless organelle platform to control endogenous cellular activities through sequestration and insulation of native proteins. We engineer and express a disordered protein scaffold to assemble micron-size condensates and recruit endogenous clients via genomic tagging with high-affinity dimerization motifs. By relocalizing up to 90% of targeted enzymes to synthetic condensates, we efficiently control cellular behaviors, including proliferation, division and cytoskeletal organization. Further, we demonstrate multiple strategies for controlled cargo release from condensates to switch cells between functional states. These synthetic organelles offer a powerful and generalizable approach to modularly control cell decision-making in a variety of model systems with broad applications for cellular engineering."

https://openalex.org/W3191325495,"Inference of action potentials (‘spikes’) from neuronal calcium signals is complicated by the scarcity of simultaneous measurements of action potentials and calcium signals (‘ground truth’). In this study, we compiled a large, diverse ground truth database from publicly available and newly performed recordings in zebrafish and mice covering a broad range of calcium indicators, cell types and signal-to-noise ratios, comprising a total of more than 35 recording hours from 298 neurons. We developed an algorithm for spike inference (termed CASCADE) that is based on supervised deep networks, takes advantage of the ground truth database, infers absolute spike rates and outperforms existing model-based algorithms. To optimize performance for unseen imaging data, CASCADE retrains itself by resampling ground truth data to match the respective sampling rate and noise level; therefore, no parameters need to be adjusted by the user. In addition, we developed systematic performance assessments for unseen data, openly released a resource toolbox and provide a user-friendly cloud-based implementation. Rupprecht et al. compiled a large database of simultaneous electrophysiological and calcium recordings from the same neurons. An algorithm (termed CASCADE) trained with this ground truth enables reliable spike inference without the need to tune parameters."

https://openalex.org/W3191116136,"Metastasis is the leading cause of cancer-related deaths and enables cancer cells to compromise organ function by expanding in secondary sites. Since primary tumours and metastases often share the same constellation of driver mutations, the mechanisms that drive their distinct phenotypes are unclear. Here we show that inactivation of the frequently mutated tumour suppressor gene LKB1 (encoding liver kinase B1) has evolving effects throughout the progression of lung cancer, which leads to the differential epigenetic re-programming of early-stage primary tumours compared with late-stage metastases. By integrating genome-scale CRISPR-Cas9 screening with bulk and single-cell multi-omic analyses, we unexpectedly identify LKB1 as a master regulator of chromatin accessibility in lung adenocarcinoma primary tumours. Using an in vivo model of metastatic progression, we further show that loss of LKB1 activates the early endoderm transcription factor SOX17 in metastases and a metastatic-like sub-population of cancer cells within primary tumours. The expression of SOX17 is necessary and sufficient to drive a second wave of epigenetic changes in LKB1-deficient cells that enhances metastatic ability. Overall, our study demonstrates how the downstream effects of an individual driver mutation can change throughout cancer development, with implications for stage-specific therapeutic resistance mechanisms and the gene regulatory underpinnings of metastatic evolution."
https://openalex.org/W3191281378,"Predictive motion encoding is an important aspect of visually guided behavior that allows animals to estimate the trajectory of moving objects. Motion prediction is understood primarily in the context of translational motion, but the environment contains other types of behaviorally salient motion correlation such as those produced by approaching or receding objects. However, the neural mechanisms that detect and predictively encode these correlations remain unclear. We report here that four of the parallel output pathways in the primate retina encode predictive motion information, and this encoding occurs for several classes of spatiotemporal correlation that are found in natural vision. Such predictive coding can be explained by known nonlinear circuit mechanisms that produce a nearly optimal encoding, with transmitted information approaching the theoretical limit imposed by the stimulus itself. Thus, these neural circuit mechanisms efficiently separate predictive information from nonpredictive information during the encoding process."

Some forms of HPFH are associated with γ-globin promoter variants that either disrupt binding motifs for transcriptional repressors or create new motifs for transcriptional activators. How these variants sustain γ-globin gene expression postnatally remains undefined. We mapped γ-globin promoter sequences functionally in erythroid cells harboring different HPFH variants. Those that disrupt a BCL11A repressor binding element induce γ-globin expression by facilitating the recruitment of nuclear transcription factor Y (NF-Y) to a nearby proximal CCAAT box and GATA1 to an upstream motif. The proximal CCAAT element becomes dispensable for HPFH variants that generate new binding motifs for activators NF-Y or KLF1, but GATA1 recruitment remains essential. Our findings define distinct mechanisms through which transcription factors and their cis-regulatory elements activate γ-globin expression in different forms of HPFH, some of which are being recreated by therapeutic genome editing."
https://openalex.org/W3193102476,"The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic is a major global threat that sparked global research efforts. Pre-clinical and biochemical SARS-CoV-2 studies firstly rely on cell culture experiments where the importance of choosing an appropriate cell culture model is often underestimated. We here present a bottom-up approach to identify suitable permissive cancer cell lines for drug screening and virus research. Human cancer cell lines were screened for the SARS-CoV-2 cellular entry factors ACE2 and TMPRSS2 based on RNA-seq data of the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia (CCLE). However, experimentally testing permissiveness towards SARS-CoV-2 infection, we found limited correlation between receptor expression and permissiveness. This underlines that permissiveness of cells towards viral infection is determined not only by the presence of entry receptors but is defined by the availability of cellular resources, intrinsic immunity, and apoptosis. Aside from established cell culture infection models CACO-2 and CALU-3, three highly permissive human cell lines, colon cancer cell lines CL-14 and CL-40 and the breast cancer cell line CAL-51 and several low permissive cell lines were identified. Cell lines were characterised in more detail offering a broader choice of non-overexpression in vitro infection models to the scientific community. For some cell lines a truncated ACE2 mRNA and missense variants in TMPRSS2 might hint at disturbed host susceptibility towards viral entry."
https://openalex.org/W3192864846,"Epidemiological evidence on peripheral iron and cognitive impairment in older adults is sparse and limited. Results on serum iron and cognitive impairment in older adults from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey have not been reported. Data on serum iron and cognitive impairment from individuals ≥ 60 years of age were obtained from the 2011–2014 NHANES (N = 3,131). Serum iron concentrations were determined with DcX800 method. Cognitive impairment was assessed with four cognitive tests: the Digit Symbol Substitution Test (DSST), the Animal Fluency (AF), the Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer’s Disease Delayed Recall (CERAD-DR) and Word Learning (CERAD-WL) tests. Logistic regression and restricted cubic splines were adopted to explore the dose-response relationship between serum iron concentrations and cognitive impairment. Comparing the highest to lowest tertile of serum iron concentrations, the multivariate-adjusted odds ratios of scoring low on the DSST were 0.70 (0.49–1.00), 0.88 (0.65–1.20) for CERAD-WL, 0.65 (0.48–0.88) for CERAD-DR, and 0.78 (0.53–1.15) for AF. Stratified analyses by sex showed that the above-mentioned associations were mainly found in men; however, the interaction with sex was not significant. Dose-response analysis showed that relationships between serum iron and cognitive impairment evaluated by DSST and CERAD-DR were linear, respectively."
https://openalex.org/W3188026843,"The cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) anion channel is essential to maintain fluid homeostasis in key organs. Functional impairment of CFTR due to mutations in the cftr gene leads to cystic fibrosis. Here, we show that the first nucleotide-binding domain (NBD1) of CFTR can spontaneously adopt an alternate conformation that departs from the canonical NBD fold previously observed. Crystallography reveals that this conformation involves a topological reorganization of NBD1. Single-molecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer microscopy shows that the equilibrium between the conformations is regulated by adenosine triphosphate binding. However, under destabilizing conditions, such as the disease-causing mutation F508del, this conformational flexibility enables unfolding of the β-subdomain. Our data indicate that, in wild-type CFTR, this conformational transition of NBD1 regulates channel function, but, in the presence of the F508del mutation, it allows domain misfolding and subsequent protein degradation. Our work provides a framework to design conformation-specific therapeutics to prevent noxious transitions. The cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator anion channel can adopt an alternate conformation of its nucleotide-binding domain, which affects channel activity and, under certain conditions, leads to unfolding and protein degradation."
https://openalex.org/W3187738905,"Optimal medical therapy after myocardial infarction with nonobstructive coronary arteries (MINOCA; <50% stenosis) is uncertain. We evaluated variability in discharge prescription of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors / angiotensin receptor blockers (ACEI/ARB) and beta-blockers (BB) to MINOCA patients between hospitals to assess physician equipoise about secondary prevention.Patients with MINOCA between 2007-2014 were identified in the NCDR Chest Pain-MI Registry. Those with prior revascularization or missing demographic, angiographic, or medication data were excluded. Analysis was limited to high-volume hospitals with ≥20 MINOCA total discharges. Discharge prescriptions for ACEI/ARB and BB after MINOCA were analyzed for each hospital. Clinical data on left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), glomerular filtration rate (GFR), and diabetes mellitus status were extracted to identify other indications for ACEI/ARB or BB.Clinical data were available for 17,849 MINOCA patients, of whom 8,752 (49%) had LVEF <40%, GFR ≤60 mL/min, and/or diabetes. 5,913 patients without one of these indications for ACEI/ARB or BB were discharged from 156 high-volume hospitals. At discharge, ACEI/ARB was prescribed to between 16.0% and 88.8% of MINOCA patients (median 45.6%, IQR 38.0%-56.5%) and BB to between 28.0% and 97.5% (median 74.1%, IQR 64.7%-80.0%).There is marked variability between hospitals in the proportions of patients receiving ACEI/ARB and BB after hospitalization for MINOCA, suggesting clinical equipoise about the routine use of these agents. Randomized clinical trials are necessary to establish the benefit of ACEI/ARB and BB to improve outcomes after MINOCA."
https://openalex.org/W3187485916,"This research aims to identify, rank, and create an interplay among the psychological barriers to adopting Industry 4.0 technologies in the manufacturing sector. A comprehensive literature review tracked by a discussion with industry and academic experts recognized 20 barriers. Based on three widely acclaimed statistical techniques, hybrid AHP-TOPSIS (Analytical Hierarchy Process-Technique for Order Performance by Similarity to Ideal Solution) and ISM (Interpretative Structural Modeling), critical psychological barriers have been investigated. A group of 8 experts from industry and academia with at least 10 years of experience was consulted for AHP and ISM techniques. Whereas TOPSIS was conducted by 443 operational-level users, including managers and supervisors of different functional areas of the manufacturing industry located in Pakistan. The findings reveal that ‘Fear of job losses’, ‘Fear of data loss/Risk of security breaches, ‘Lack of advanced &amp; continued education of employees’ and ‘Lack of standards and reference architecture’, with highest importance weights, emerged as the most prominent psychological barriers in developing economies. Then the interrelations among these barriers resulted in a four-layered structural model. The driver barriers identified in the final model advocate that development in ‘advanced &amp; continued education of employees’, ‘standards &amp; reference architecture’ and ‘minimization of fear of job &amp; data loss’ can expedite the adoption of industry 4.0 (i4.0) technologies. The study uniquely develops hierarchical relationships among the psychological barriers for adopting i4.0 in the manufacturing context using AHP-TOPSIS and ISM techniques. The study would be valuable for practitioners, decision-makers and companies that wish to focus their efforts and resources on removing the most critical barriers and challenges for the seamless implementation of Industry 4.0."

https://openalex.org/W3187172692,"Polyphenols, especially catechol-type polyphenols, exhibit lysyl oxidase-like activity and mediate oxidative deamination of lysine residues in proteins. Previous studies have shown that polyphenol-mediated oxidative deamination of lysine residues can be associated with altered electrical properties of proteins and increased crossreactivity with natural immunoglobulin M antibodies. This interaction suggested that oxidized proteins could act as innate antigens and elicit an innate immune response. However, the structural basis for oxidatively deaminated lysine residues remains unclear. In the present study, to establish the chemistry of lysine oxidation, we characterized oxidation products obtained via incubation of the lysine analog N-biotinyl-5-aminopentylamine with eggshell membranes containing lysyl oxidase and identified a unique six-membered ring 2-piperidinol derivative equilibrated with a ring-open product (aldehyde) as the major product. By monitoring these aldehyde-2-piperidinol products, we evaluated the lysyl oxidase-like activity of polyphenols. We also observed that this reaction was mediated by some polyphenols, especially o-diphenolic-type polyphenols, in the presence of copper ions. Interestingly, the natural immunoglobulin M monoclonal antibody recognized these aldehyde-2-piperidinol products as an innate epitope. These findings establish the existence of a dynamic equilibrium of oxidized lysine and provide important insights into the chemopreventive function of dietary polyphenols for chronic diseases."
https://openalex.org/W3187965654,"Ventricular-arterial coupling is a major determinant of cardiovascular performance, however, there are still inherent difficulties in distinguishing ventricular from vascular effects on arterial pulse phenotypes. In the present study, we employed an extensive mathematical model of the cardiovascular system to investigate how sole changes in cardiac contractility might affect hemodynamics. We simulated two physiologically relevant cases of high and low contractility by altering the end-systolic elastance, E es , (3 versus 1 mmHg/mL) under constant cardiac output and afterload, and subsequently performed pulse wave analysis and wave separation. The aortic forward pressure wave component was steeper for high E es , which led to the change of the total pressure waveform from the characteristic Type A phenotype to Type C , and the decrease in augmentation index, AIx (-2.4% versus +18.1%). Additionally, the increase in E es caused the pulse pressure amplification from the aorta to the radial artery to rise drastically (1.86 versus 1.39). Our results show that an increase in cardiac contractility alone, with no concomitant change in arterial properties, alters the shape of the forward pressure wave, which, consequently, changes central and peripheral pulse phenotypes. Indices based on the pressure waveform, like AIx , cannot be assumed to reflect only arterial properties."
https://openalex.org/W3188270360,"Ribonuclease P (RNase P) is an endoribonuclease that catalyzes the processing of the 5' leader sequence of precursor tRNA (pre-tRNA). Ribonucleoprotein RNase P and protein-only RNase P (PRORP) in eukaryotes have been extensively studied, but the mechanism by which a prokaryotic nuclease recognizes and cleaves pre-tRNA is unclear. To gain insights into this mechanism, we studied homologs of Aquifex RNase P (HARPs), thought to be enzymes of approximately 23 kDa comprising only this nuclease domain. We determined the cryo-EM structure of Aq880, the first identified HARP enzyme. The structure unexpectedly revealed that Aq880 consists of both the nuclease and protruding helical (PrH) domains. Aq880 monomers assemble into a dimer via the PrH domain. Six dimers form a dodecamer with a left-handed one-turn superhelical structure. The structure also revealed that the active site of Aq880 is analogous to that of eukaryotic PRORPs. The pre-tRNA docking model demonstrated that 5' processing of pre-tRNAs is achieved by two adjacent dimers within the dodecamer. One dimer is responsible for catalysis, and the PrH domains of the other dimer are responsible for pre-tRNA elbow recognition. Our study suggests that HARPs measure an invariant distance from the pre-tRNA elbow to cleave the 5' leader sequence, which is analogous to the mechanism of eukaryotic PRORPs and the ribonucleoprotein RNase P. Collectively, these findings shed light on how different types of RNase P enzymes utilize the same pre-tRNA processing."
https://openalex.org/W3191223038,"Background Over the years, sanitation programs over the world have focused more on household sanitation, with limited attention towards the disposal of children’s stools. This lack of attention could be due to the misconception that children’s stools are harmless. The current study examined the individual and contextual predictors of safe disposal of children’s faeces among women in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). Methods The study used secondary data involving 128,096 mother-child pairs of under-five children from the current Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) in 15 sub-Saharan African countries from 2015 to 2018. Multilevel logistic analysis was used to assess the individual and contextual factors associated with the practice of safe disposal of children’s faeces. We presented the results as adjusted odds ratios (aOR) at a statistical significance of p&lt; 0.05. Results The results show that 58.73% (57.79–59.68) of childbearing women in the 15 countries in SSA included in our study safely disposed off their children’s stools. This varied from as high as 85.90% (84.57–87.14) in Rwanda to as low as 26.38% (24.01–28.91) in Chad. At the individual level, the practice of safe disposal of children’s stools was more likely to occur among children aged 1, compared to those aged 0 [aOR = 1.74; 95% CI: 1.68–1.80] and those with diarrhoea compared to those without diarrhoea [aOR = 1.17, 95% CI: 1.13–1.21]. Mothers with primary level of education [aOR = 1.42, 95% CI: 1.30–1.5], those aged 35–39 [aOR = 1.20, 95% CI: 1.12–1.28], and those exposed to radio [aOR = 1.23, 95% CI: 1.20–1.27] were more likely to practice safe disposal of children’s stools. Conversely, the odds of safe disposal of children’s stool were lower among mothers who were married [aOR = 0.74, 95% CI: 0.69–0.80] and those who belonged to the Traditional African Religion [aOR = 0.64, 95% CI: 0.51–0.80]. With the contextual factors, women with improved water [aOR = 1.13, 95% CI: 1.10–1.16] and improved toilet facility [aOR = 5.75 95% CI: 5.55–5.95] had higher odds of safe disposal of children’s stool. On the other hand, mothers who lived in households with 5 or more children [aOR = 0.89, 95% CI: 0.86–0.93], those in rural areas [aOR = 0.86, 95% CI: 0.82–0.89], and those who lived in Central Africa [aOR = 0.19, 95% CI: 0.18–0.21] were less likely to practice safe disposal of children’s stools. Conclusion The findings indicate that between- and within-country contextual variations and commonalities need to be acknowledged in designing interventions to enhance safe disposal of children’s faeces. Audio-visual education on safe faecal disposal among rural women and large households can help enhance safe disposal. In light of the strong association between safe stool disposal and improved latrine use in SSA, governments need to develop feasible and cost-effective strategies to increase the number of households with access to improved toilet facilities."
https://openalex.org/W3191416200,"The three-spined stickleback Gasterosteus aculeatus invaded Lake Contance in the 1940s and expanded in large numbers from an exclusively shoreline habitat into the pelagic zone in 2012. Stickleback abundance is very high in the pelagic zone in winter near the spawning time of pelagic whitefish Coregonus wartmanni , and it is hypothesized that this is triggered by the opportunity to consume whitefish eggs. Field sampling has qualitatively confirmed predation of whitefish eggs by stickleback, but quantification has proven difficult due to stormy conditions that limit sampling. One fundamental unknown is if freshwater stickleback, known as visual feeders, can successfully find and eat whitefish eggs during twilight and night when whitefish spawn. It is also unknown how long eggs can be identified in stomachs following ingestion, which could limit efforts to quantify egg predation through stomach content analysis. To answer these questions, 144 individuals were given the opportunity to feed on whitefish roe under daylight, twilight, and darkness in controlled conditions. The results showed that stickleback can ingest as many as 100 whitefish eggs under any light conditions, and some individuals even consumed maximum numbers in complete darkness. Furthermore, eggs could be unambiguously identified in the stomach 24 hours after consumption. Whitefish eggs have 28% more energy content than the main diet of sticklebacks (zooplankton) based on bomb-calorimetric measurements, underlining the potential benefits of consuming eggs. Based on experimental results and estimates of stickleback abundance and total egg production, stickleback could potentially consume substantial proportions of the total eggs produced even if relatively few sticklebacks consume eggs. Given the evidence that stickleback can feed on eggs during nighttime spawning and may thereby hamper recruitment, future studies aimed at quantifying actual egg predation and resulting effects on the whitefish population are urgently needed."
https://openalex.org/W3187431490,"This paper classifies the karst landscapes of the Petén Plateau and defines the Mirador-Calakmul Karst Basin by illustrating the distribution of its karst hydrologic features. Archaeological and spatial research of the Mirador-Calakmul area of Guatemala and Mexico has shown it to be a karst basin with geopolitical implications. Current research characterizes the karst landscapes of the Petén Plateau, maps the distribution of karst hydrologic features, and delineates the basin in geomorphological terms. To further this aim, multiple forms of remote sensing data including orthophotographs, a satellite Digital Elevation Model, satellite multispectral images, and Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) data have been integrated to interpret the karst features in the study area. Outcrop study and thin section analysis of the upper Buena Vista Formation document that the dominant lithologies are a shallow water algal boundstone interbedded with terrestrial caliche. Karst landforms have been mapped over the Petén Plateau and we identify five karst landscapes, the largest of which is a fluviokarst landscape dominated by karst valleys. We further map karst hydrologic features including seasonal swamps, dolines, intermittent lakes, intermittent streams, solution-enhanced fractures, and springs all of which are characteristic of drainage basins. Boundaries of the karst basin are mapped from multiple lines of evidence including distribution of the karst valleys, a line of springs along the western boundary of the fluviokarst landscape, and a surface drainage analysis. We capture and classify hydrologic data points and develop a regional groundwater map that indicates subsurface flow from east to west within the basin. A drainage map illustrates the extensive system of karst valleys, boundaries, and inferred groundwater flow paths of the Mirador-Calakmul Karst Basin. It was within this geomorphological setting that the ancient Maya developed an extensive civilization during the Middle and Late Preclassic periods (1000 BCE-150 CE)."
https://openalex.org/W3187627862,"Gene flow studies provide information on gene exchange between populations, which is essential for developing genetic conservation strategies. Such analyses enable a better understanding of the life history and seed and pollen dispersal mechanisms of plant species. In this study, we investigate pollen and seed flow in a regenerant population of the pioneer species Astronium fraxinifolium in an area degraded during the construction of a hydroelectric dam. We mapped, sampled, sexed, and genotyped 386 individuals in the regenerant population (RP), as well as 128 adult trees located along two highways adjacent to the degraded area; one in Mato Grosso do Sul State (MS) and other in São Paulo State (SP). Parentage analyses was carried out for 370 individuals of the RP population, using as putative parents 348 individuals from RP and all 128 individuals sampled in MS and SP. Based on parentage analysis and eight microsatellite loci, our analyses revealed that for individuals of the RP with an identified father (pollen donor), 1.1% of the pollen was dispersed up to 532 m, while for those with an identified mother (seed donor), 0.5% of seeds were dispersed up to 4,782 m. However, a large proportion of pollen (76.5%) and seeds (57%) immigrated from trees outside the sampled populations. Pollen and seeds were dispersed through a pattern of isolation by distance. Genetic diversity was significantly similar between adults of both highway populations and individuals from RP, with significant levels of inbreeding detected only in RP. Our results demonstrate that the nearest trees contributed pollen and seeds for the recovery of the degraded area, indicating reproductive spatial isolation among the sampled populations due to the damming of the river. Such results help to understand the process of regeneration for A . fraxinifolium in regenerant populations to inform strategies for conservation and environmental recovery with this species."
https://openalex.org/W3187856903,"The Multidimensional Poverty Index (MPI) is an income-based poverty index which measures multiple deprivations alongside other relevant factors to determine and classify poverty. The implementation of a reliable MPI is one of the significant efforts by the Malaysian government to improve measures in alleviating poverty, in line with the recent policy for Bottom 40 Percent (B40) group. However, using this measurement, only 0.86% of Malaysians are regarded as multidimensionally poor, and this measurement was claimed to be irrelevant for Malaysia as a country that has rapid economic development. Therefore, this study proposes a B40 clustering-based K-Means with cosine similarity architecture to identify the right indicators and dimensions that will provide data driven MPI measurement. In order to evaluate the approach, this study conducted extensive experiments on the Malaysian Census dataset. A series of data preprocessing steps were implemented, including data integration, attribute generation, data filtering, data cleaning, data transformation and attribute selection. The clustering model produced eight clusters of B40 group. The study included a comprehensive clustering analysis to meaningfully understand each of the clusters. The analysis discovered seven indicators of multidimensional poverty from three dimensions encompassing education, living standard and employment. Out of the seven indicators, this study proposed six indicators to be added to the current MPI to establish a more meaningful scenario of the current poverty trend in Malaysia. The outcomes from this study may help the government in properly identifying the B40 group who suffers from financial burden, which could have been currently misclassified."
https://openalex.org/W3189057280,"The base excision repair (BER) pathway involves gap filling by DNA polymerase (pol) β and subsequent nick sealing by ligase IIIα. X-ray cross-complementing protein 1 (XRCC1), a nonenzymatic scaffold protein, assembles multiprotein complexes, although the mechanism by which XRCC1 orchestrates the final steps of coordinated BER remains incompletely defined. Here, using a combination of biochemical and biophysical approaches, we revealed that the polβ/XRCC1 complex increases the processivity of BER reactions after correct nucleotide insertion into gaps in DNA and enhances the handoff of nicked repair products to the final ligation step. Moreover, the mutagenic ligation of nicked repair intermediate following polβ 8-oxodGTP insertion is enhanced in the presence of XRCC1. Our results demonstrated a stabilizing effect of XRCC1 on the formation of polβ/dNTP/gap DNA and ligase IIIα/ATP/nick DNA catalytic ternary complexes. Real-time monitoring of protein-protein interactions and DNA-binding kinetics showed stronger binding of XRCC1 to polβ than to ligase IIIα or aprataxin, and higher affinity for nick DNA with undamaged or damaged ends than for one nucleotide gap repair intermediate. Finally, we demonstrated slight differences in stable polβ/XRCC1 complex formation, polβ and ligase IIIα protein interaction kinetics, and handoff process as a result of cancer-associated (P161L, R194W, R280H, R399Q, Y576S) and cerebellar ataxia-related (K431N) XRCC1 variants. Overall, our findings provide novel insights into the coordinating role of XRCC1 and the effect of its disease-associated variants on substrate-product channeling in multiprotein/DNA complexes for efficient BER."
https://openalex.org/W3189973830,"The FoF1 synthase produces ATP from ADP and inorganic phosphate. The γ subunit of FoF1 ATP synthase in photosynthetic organisms, which is the rotor subunit of this enzyme, contains a characteristic β-hairpin structure. This structure is formed from an insertion sequence that has been conserved only in phototrophs. Using recombinant subcomplexes, we previously demonstrated that this region plays an essential role in the regulation of ATP hydrolysis activity, thereby functioning in controlling intracellular ATP levels in response to changes in the light environment. However, the role of this region in ATP synthesis has long remained an open question because its analysis requires the preparation of the whole FoF1 complex and a transmembrane proton-motive force. In this study, we successfully prepared proteoliposomes containing the entire FoF1 ATP synthase from a cyanobacterium, Synechocystis sp.

The relatively simple genetic manipulation of Synechocystis enabled the biochemical investigation of the role of the β-hairpin structure of FoF1 ATP synthase and its activities. We further performed physiological analyses of Synechocystis mutant strains lacking the β-hairpin structure, which provided novel insights into the regulatory mechanisms of FoF1 ATP synthase in cyanobacteria via the phototroph-specific region of the γ subunit.

The relatively simple genetic manipulation of Synechocystis enabled the biochemical investigation of the role of the β-hairpin structure of FoF1 ATP synthase and its activities. We further performed physiological analyses of Synechocystis mutant strains lacking the β-hairpin structure, which provided novel insights into the regulatory mechanisms of FoF1 ATP synthase in cyanobacteria via the phototroph-specific region of the γ subunit. Our results indicated that this structure critically contributes to ATP synthesis and suppresses ATP hydrolysis. Photosynthetic organisms utilize FoF1 ATP synthase (FoF1) for a solar-to-chemical energy conversion system to produce ATP, the universal energy currency for cells. Under illumination, photosynthetic electron transport is activated, generating a proton electrochemical gradient (proton motive force, pmf) across the thylakoid membrane, which drives ATP synthesis (1Kramer D.M.

In the dark, or when the pmf is insufficient, FoF1 hydrolyzes ATP as the reverse reaction and transports H+ to the lumen. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that these organisms have evolved a unique mechanism for regulating FoF1 activity that utilizes pmf for synthesizing ATP. Although the molecular mechanism underlying its catalytic reactions of ATP synthesis/hydrolysis has been extensively studied over the past decades, the regulation mechanisms of FoF1 exhibit variation among species/organelles and remain unclear. To date, two inhibitory mechanisms, MgADP-induced inhibition (MgADP inhibition), which is conferred by the occupation of the catalytic site of the β subunit by MgADP, and ε-inhibition, an intrinsic inhibitory mechanism, have been shown to be conserved among bacterial FoF1s and are considered to be important for avoiding the futile ATP hydrolysis reaction and ensuring efficient ATP synthesis (5Konno H.

In addition, in chloroplasts, it was previously demonstrated that ATP hydrolysis activity is regulated by intramolecular disulfide bond formation/dissociation in the γ subunit (6Kramer D.M.

However, in cyanobacteria, which are the phylogenetic ancestors of chloroplasts (9Falcon L.I. Magallon S. Castillo A. Dating the cyanobacterial ancestor of the chloroplast.ISME J. 2010; 4: 777-783Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), this regulation does not occur, as the cyanobacterial γ subunit is devoid of the Cys residues, which are responsible for this redox regulation (10Miki J.

Furthermore, the cyanobacterial regulatory mechanism for ATP synthesis reaction is still obscure. FoF1 has a dual rotary-motor architecture, which couples the catalytic ATP synthesis/hydrolysis reactions with the electrochemical potential of H+ across the biological membrane (11Yoshida M.

F1 has a subunit stoichiometry of α3β3γ1δ1ε1, and the rotor shaft moiety composed of the γε subunits rotates inside of the stator subunits, α3β3, by the energy of ATP hydrolysis. Catalytic sites that are necessary for the ATP synthesis/hydrolysis reactions are present in the β subunit. The membrane-embedded Fo consists of three types of subunits with the stoichiometry of a1b2cn, where the rotor-ring composed of multimeric c subunits (c-ring) rotates relative to a stator part, ab2. The number of the c subunits in the ring varies among species, from 8 to 15 (15Stock D. Leslie A.G. Walker J.E.

The γ subunit, a part of the rotor shaft of F1 motor, comprises N- and C-terminal helical domains, as well as a protruding globular Rossmann fold domain located between these two helical parts (Fig. 1A). The N- and C-terminal helical domains assemble into an antiparallel coiled-coil stalk, which is almost embedded in the central cavity of the catalytic headpiece, α3β3, as a rotor shaft. Moreover, the cyanobacterial and chloroplast γ subunits possess an inserted sequence of 30 or 39 amino acid residues within the Rossmann fold (Fig. 1, A and B) (10Miki J. Maeda M. Mukohata Y.

For a long time, the structure of this region remained unknown; however, since 2018, three papers have been published on this subject; two of them pertain to the structures of FoF1 from the chloroplasts of Spinacea oleracea and the other describes the structure of the γ–ε subcomplex from a thermophilic cyanobacterium, Thermosynechococcus elongatus BP-1 (T. elongatus) (23Hahn A.

It was revealed that this region forms a unique β-hairpin structure that extends along the central coiled-coil stalk and interacts with the “DELSEED” loop of the β subunit (Fig. 1C). This negatively charged loop is highly conserved among FoF1s, and its conformation is important for torque transmission from the catalytic site to the γ subunit upon ATP binding, thus affecting ATP hydrolysis activity (26Mnatsakanyan N.

Only the chloroplasts from green plants and algae have an additional nine amino acids containing the above-mentioned redox-active Cys residues at the N terminus of the insertion region (Fig. 1B). It was shown that the ATP hydrolysis activity of the reduced form is significantly higher than that of the oxidized form (12Hisabori T. Sunamura E. Kim Y. Konno H.

Influence of the redox state and the activation of the chloroplast ATP synthase on proton-transport-coupled ATP synthesis/hydrolysis.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 893: 275-288Crossref Scopus (131) Google Scholar). In 2018, Hahn et al. (23Hahn A. Vonck J. Mills D.J. Meier T. Kuhlbrandt W. Structure, mechanism, and regulation of the chloroplast ATP synthase.Science. 2018; 360eaat4318Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar) reported that this sequence forms an additional small β-hairpin structure. Moreover, Yang et al. (25Yang J.H. Williams D. Kandiah E. Fromme P. Chiu P.L. Structural basis of redox modulation on chloroplast ATP synthase.Commun. Biol. 2020; 3: 482Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) recently published the structures of both oxidized/reduced FoF1 from spinach chloroplasts. In view of the molecular structure, the interactions between the DELSEED-loop of the β subunit and the β-hairpin structure of the γ subunit did not differ significantly between the oxidized and reduced states (25Yang J.H. Williams D. Kandiah E. Fromme P. Chiu P.L. Structural basis of redox modulation on chloroplast ATP synthase.Commun. Biol. 2020; 3: 482Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). It is possible that, in cyanobacteria, which are devoid of this small redox-active β-hairpin, the interaction between the DELSEED loop of the β subunit and the β-hairpin structure of the γ subunit differs from that of chloroplasts. As shown in Figure 1C, the tilting angle of the cyanobacterial β-hairpin appears to be slightly different from that of both the oxidized and reduced forms of the spinach γ subunit. As the only structure of the cyanobacterial γ subunit that has been published to date is the γ–ε subcomplex (24Murakami S. Kondo K. Katayama S. Hara S. Sunamura E.I. Yamashita E. Groth G. Hisabori T. Structure of the gamma-epsilon complex of cyanobacterial F1-ATPase reveals a suppression mechanism of the gamma subunit on ATP hydrolysis in phototrophs.Biochem. J. 2018; 475: 2925-2939Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar), its interaction with the DELSEED loop is not fully understood. In our previous reports, using recombinant α3β3γ derived from T. elongatus, we demonstrated that the phototroph-specific insertion region plays an important role in MgADP inhibition (30Sunamura E. Konno H. Imashimizu-Kobayashi M. Sugano Y. Hisabori T. Physiological impact of intrinsic ADP inhibition of cyanobacterial FoF1 conferred by the inherent sequence inserted into the γ subunit.Plant Cell Physiol. 2010; 51: 855-865Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The whole-β-hairpin-truncated α3β3γ (α3β3γΔ198–222) exhibited higher ATP hydrolysis activity than the wildtype form. We also demonstrated that the two-amino-acid truncations at the turn of the β-hairpin structure (α3β3γΔ212–213) resulted in a significant increase in ATP hydrolysis activity via the cancelation of MgADP inhibition. Truncation of an even greater number of amino acids did not raise the activity further (α3β3γΔ211–214, α3β3γΔ210–215, α3β3γΔ209–216, and α3β3γΔ205–220) (24Murakami S. Kondo K. Katayama S. Hara S. Sunamura E.I. Yamashita E. Groth G. Hisabori T.

J. 2018; 475: 2925-2939Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). These results strongly suggested that the interaction between the DELSEED loop of the β subunit and the two amino acids located at the turn of the β-hairpin structure is sufficient to induce MgADP inhibition upon ATP hydrolysis. This model was supported by our studies using recombinant α3β3γ derived from T. elongatus with nick insertion into the proximal region of the β-hairpin structure (between V222 and T223) and cross-linking experiments using disulfide bond formation between the central stalk and the β-hairpin structure within the γ subunit (31Kondo K.

Those findings prompted us to investigate the correlation between the β-hairpin structure and ATP synthesis and H+-translocation in cyanobacterial FoF1. To date, the role of this structure in ATP synthesis and H+-translocation has not been elucidated, partly because those measurements require the preparation of the reproducible quality of proteoliposomes (PLs) and quantitative application of ΔμH+ across the membrane. Here, we set up a one-step mild purification method of cyanobacterial FoF1 from Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 (S. 6803). S. 6803 is a mesophilic cyanobacterium that allows easy genetic engineering, as this strain is capable of natural transformation with high efficiency in double homologous recombination and its genome harbors sufficient homology to T. elongatus: their amino acid sequences of the γ subunit share 73% homology (Fig. 2A). We analyzed the ATP hydrolysis/synthesis and H+-translocating activities of the wildtype and β-hairpin-truncated FoF1 mutants. Based on the detailed biochemical analyses of these phenomena using phototroph-derived FoF1, we here describe the role of the conserved β-hairpin structure in ATP synthesis. Our results demonstrated that the phototroph-specific β-hairpin structure of the γ subunit of FoF1 critically contributes to its ATP synthesis activity, in addition to suppressing ATP hydrolysis. We also performed physiological analyses using S. 6803 and found that the intracellular ATP content was significantly decreased in the β-hairpin-truncated mutants. However, under our experimental conditions, there was no noticeable effect other than the decrease in the amount of ATP. To investigate the role of the β-hairpin on ATP synthesis function, we purified FoF1 preparations from S. 6803, as follows. First, the His10-tag sequence was genetically fused to the N terminus of the β subunit in S. 6803 (Fig. S2A). The resulting S. 6803 was termed WT strain in the present study. Then, thylakoid membranes were prepared from the WT strain and solubilized with lauryl maltose neopentyl glycol (LMNG). The FoF1 preparation was purified from the solubilized fraction by Ni-affinity chromatography. The resulting FoF1 preparation was subjected to SDS-PAGE (Fig. 3A, lane WT). Nine types of bands were observed on the gel, which were assumed to correspond to the nine subunits of WT-FoF1. The band intensity of the eight bands other than that corresponding to the c subunit agreed with the expected subunit stoichiometry of S. 6803 FoF1, i.e., α3β3γεδabb’cn. The validity of the bands was confirmed by peptide mass fingerprinting after trypsin digestion, N-terminal sequencing, or immunoblot analyses (Table 1 and Fig. 3B). The SDS-PAGE analysis additionally identified a band corresponding to the c subunit above that of the α subunit on the gel (Fig. 3, A and B). As observed previously in the c subunit of Propionigenium modestum (33Suzuki T. Ozaki Y. Sone N. Feniouk B.A. Yoshida M. The product of uncI gene in F1Fo-ATP synthase operon plays a chaperone-like role to assist c-ring assembly.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2007; 104: 20776-20781Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), the c subunits of S. 6803 formed a stable c-ring architecture that was resistant to the electrophoretic analysis, although the number of c subunits in the ring remained obscure (which was previously reported as 14 in the literature) (21Pogoryelov D. Reichen C. Klyszejko A.L. Brunisholz R. Muller D.J. Dimroth P. Meier T. The oligomeric state of c rings from cyanobacterial F-ATP synthases varies from 13 to 15.J. Bacteriol. 2007; 189: 5895-5902Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Furthermore, N-terminal sequencing of the a subunit pinpointed the location of the proteolytic cleavage position between Ala42 and Ala43. Based on the genomic sequence of the a subunit in the KEGG database (https://www.genome.jp/kegg/; accession number, sll1322), an N-terminal 42-residue segment is suggested to be processed. However, a multiple sequence alignment showed that an N-terminal region composed of 28 residues in S. 6803 was not present in those of other cyanobacteria. This result suggests that the translation of the a subunit starts at a second methionine, Met29, of the open reading frame provided in the database (Fig. S3). If so, the 14 N-terminal residues are the correct segment, which is processed by proteolytic digestion in S. 6803. Because the N terminus of the a subunit is located on the lumenal side of thylakoid membranes (23Hahn A. Vonck J. Mills D.J. Meier T. Kuhlbrandt W. Structure, mechanism, and regulation of the chloroplast ATP synthase.Science. 2018; 360eaat4318Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar), the N-terminal 14-residue segment is expected to act as a signal peptide for transport across the membrane. However, further analyses are necessary to confirm this function.Table 1Subunits of the FoF1 ATP synthase of S. 6803 identified by peptide mass fingerprint analysis and N-terminal sequencing analysesSubunitIDTheoretical massMALDI-TOF MSN-terminal sequencingaUndetermined amino acids are indicated with an “X.”ScorebScore obtained by Mascot (http://www.matrixscience.com).Coverage (%)αsll132654,0009724VXIXPDEISSβslr132953,100cTheoretical mass, including the His-tag.18844Not detectedγsll132734,60012439PNLXAIXDasll132230,700Not detectedALEVGQδsll132520,0009870MXGSLYbsll132419,80010429Not detectedb'sll132316,20010030Not detectedεslr133014,6005639TLTVRVITcssl26158000Not detectedNot detecteda Undetermined amino acids are indicated with an “X.”b Score obtained by Mascot (http://www.matrixscience.com).c Theoretical mass, including the His-tag. Open table in a new tab Next, we prepared two mutated strains of S. 6803, Δ212–213 and Δ205–220, via the genome manipulation of WT-S. 6803 (Fig. 2, B and C). The complete segregation and replacement of endogenous sll1327, which encodes the γ subunit, with the mutated gene were validated by PCR analysis (Fig. 2D) and DNA sequence analysis. The mutants carried the genetic deletion of Δ212–213 or Δ205–220 of the γ subunit, respectively. Therefore, the two amino acids located at the tip of the turn region or the entire β-hairpin structure were not present in the two mutants (Fig. 2B). We then purified the mutant FoF1 using the same procedure as that used for the WT strain. No significant differences were observed in subunit stoichiometry (Fig. 3, A and B) or expression level, which was assessed based on immunoblotting using β subunit–specific antibodies (Fig. 2, E and F), between the WT and the mutant strains. The extent of MgADP inhibition was assessed by the ratio of activation of ATP hydrolysis by lauryl dimethylamine oxide (LDAO). LDAO is a nonionic detergent and considered to be effective in the release of F1 from the MgADP-inhibited state (34Jault J.M. Dou C. Grodsky N.B. Matsui T. Yoshida M. Allison W.S. The α3β3γ subcomplex of the F1-ATPase from the thermophilic bacillus PS3 with the βT165S substitution does not entrap inhibitory MgADP in a catalytic site during turnover.J. Biol.

For this purpose, the F1-enriched (“crude F1”) fractions were obtained by chloroform extraction (Fig. S4A). The results indicated that the Δ212–213 and Δ205–220 mutations led to a significant increase of ATP hydrolysis activity (Fig. S4B), and LDAO activation ratios were significantly lower than those from WT (Fig. S4C), which is consistent with the results from T. elongates (24Murakami S.

J. 2018; 475: 2925-2939Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). These results indicate that ATP hydrolysis was inhibited by MgADP in WT. The obtained FoF1 preparations were, respectively, reconstituted into soybean liposomes to obtain FoF1 PLs. As observed in the analyses of α3β3γ derived from T. elongatus (24Murakami S. Kondo K. Katayama S. Hara S. Sunamura E.I. Yamashita E. Groth G. Hisabori T.

J. 2018; 475: 2925-2939Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar), ATP hydrolysis activities of the mutant PLs were higher than those of the WT PLs (Fig. 3C). The activity was roughly 20- and 23-fold in Δ212–213 (1.0 ± 0.2 μmol Pi min−1 mg−1) and Δ205–220 (1.2 ± 0.2 μmol Pi min−1 mg−1) compared with the WT PLs (0.051 ± 0.005 μmol Pi min−1 mg−1) (Fig. 3C). The degree of the enhancement was similar in the two mutants. Subsequently, H+-translocating activity of the PLs was analyzed using a ΔpH indicator, ACMA (Fig. 4). The addition of ATP drove its hydrolysis, followed by coupled proton translocation into PLs, which was observed as the fluorescence quenching of ACMA. The Δ212–213 and Δ205–220 PLs showed a higher proton-translocating activity than WT PLs, the activity of which was diminished in the presence of the H+-ionophore FCCP. However, the increases of the activity were relatively moderate when compared with those of the ATP hydrolysis analysis: slopes of the quenching were 0.0066 ± 0.0015, 0.025 ± 0.0094, and 0.049 ± 0.017 IU s−1 for WT, Δ212–213, and Δ205–220, respectively (average ± SD, n = 3). ATP synthesis activities were then analyzed using the acid–base transition method with valinomycin-induced diffusion potential of K+ (Fig. 5A) (35Fischer S. Graber P.

The acidified PLs were rapidly injected into the assay mixture, which included a basic buffer (pH 8.8), K+, ADP, Pi, and luciferin/luciferase. The increase in luminescence intensity was monitored in real time at 30 °C using a luminometer (see the Experimental procedures section for details). The injection of PLs into the assay mixture resulted in the formation of ΔpH between the inside and outside of PLs. Simultaneously, the injection induced the diffusion of K+ from the outside to inside of PLs with the assistance of valinomycin, resulting in the formation of an inside-positive ΔΨ across the lipid bilayer of PLs. These two energies, termed ΔpH and ΔΨ, are driving forces of ATP synthesis by FoF1 (37Soga N. Kimura K. Kinosita Jr., K. Yoshida M. Suzuki T.

Subnormothermic perfusion temperatures are in use among other solid organs to improve biochemical, clinical and immunological parameters. In a rat EVLP model of donation after circulatory death (DCD) lung donors, we tested the effect of four subnormothermic EVLP temperatures that could further improve organ preservation. Warm ischemic time was of 2 hours. EVLP time was of 4 hours. Lung physiological data were recorded and metabolic parameters were assessed. Lung oxygenation at 21°C and 24°C were significantly improved whereas pulmonary vascular resistance and edema formation at 21°C EVLP were significantly worsened when compared to 37°C EVLP. The perfusate concentrations of potassium ions and lactate exiting the lungs with 28°C EVLP were significantly lower whereas sodium and chlorine ions with 32°C EVLP were significantly higher when compared to 37°C EVLP. Also compared to 37°C EVLP, the pro-inflammatory chemokines MIP2, MIP-1α, GRO-α, the cytokine IL-6 were significantly lower with 21°C, 24°C and 28°C EVLP, the IL-18 was significantly lower but only with 21°C EVLP and IL-1β was significantly lower at 21°C and 24°C EVLP. Compared to the 37°C EVLP, the lung tissue ATP content after 21°C, 24°C and 28°C EVLP were significantly higher, the carbonylated protein content after 28°C EVLP was significantly lower and we measured significantly higher myeloperoxidase activities in lung tissues with 21°C, 24°C and 32°C. The 28°C EVLP demonstrated acceptable physiological variables, significantly higher lung tissue ATP content and decreased tissue carbonylated proteins with reduced release of pro-inflammatory cytokines. In conclusion, the 28°C EVLP is a non inferior setting in comparison to the clinically approved 37°C EVLP and significantly improve biochemical, clinical and immunological parameters and may reduce I/R injuries of DCD lung donors."
https://openalex.org/W3192458633,"Background Short inter-pregnancy interval is an interval of &lt;24 months between the dates of birth of the preceding child and the conception date of the current pregnancy. Despite its direct effects on the perinatal and maternal outcomes, there is a paucity of evidence on its prevalence and determinant factors, particularly in Ethiopia. Therefore, this study assessed the prevalence and associated factors of short inter-pregnancy interval among pregnant women in Debre Berhan town, Northern Ethiopia. Methods A community based cross-sectional study was conducted among a randomly selected 496 pregnant women in Debre Berhan town from February 9 to March 9, 2020. The data were collected by using an interviewer-administered questionnaire and analyzed using STATA (14.2) statistical software. To identify the predictors of short inter-pregnancy interval, multivariable binary logistic regression was fitted and findings are presented using adjusted odds ratio (AOR) with 95% confidence interval (CI). Result The overall prevalence of short inter-pregnancy interval (&lt;24 months) among pregnant women was 205 (40.9%). Being over 30 years of age at first birth (AOR = 3.50; 95% CI: 2.12–6.01), non-use of modern contraceptive (AOR = 2.51; 95% CI: 1.23–3.71), duration of breastfeeding for less than 12 months (AOR = 2.62; 95% CI: 1.32–5.23), parity above four (AOR = 0.31; 95% CI: 0.05–0.81), and unintended pregnancy (AOR = 5.42; 95% CI: 3.34–9.22) were independently associated factors with short inter-pregnancy interval. Conclusion Despite the public health interventions being tried in the country, the prevalence of short inter-pregnancy interval in this study is high. Therefore, it implies that increasing contraceptive use and encouraging optimal breastfeeding might help in the efforts made to avert the problem."
https://openalex.org/W3187600154,"Sister chromatid cohesion (SCC), the pairing of sister chromatids after DNA replication until mitosis, is established by loading of the cohesin complex on newly replicated chromatids. Cohesin must then be maintained until mitosis to prevent segregation defects and aneuploidy. However, how SCC is established and maintained until mitosis remains incompletely understood, and emerging evidence suggests that replication stress may lead to premature SCC loss. Here, we report that the ssDNA-binding protein CTC1-STN1-TEN1 (CST) aids in SCC. CST primarily functions in telomere length regulation but also has known roles in replication restart and DNA repair. After depletion of CST subunits, we observed an increase in the complete loss of SCC. In addition, we determined that CST associates with the cohesin complex. Unexpectedly, we did not find evidence of altered cohesin loading or mitotic progression in the absence of CST; however, we did find that treatment with various replication inhibitors increased the association between CST and cohesin. Because replication stress was recently shown to induce SCC loss, we hypothesized that CST may be required to maintain or remodel SCC after DNA replication fork stalling. In agreement with this idea, SCC loss was greatly increased in CST-depleted cells after exogenous replication stress. Based on our findings, we propose that CST aids in the maintenance of SCC at stalled replication forks to prevent premature cohesion loss."
https://openalex.org/W3187960168,"Background The health of transgender men (trans men)–individuals who identify as men and were assigned a female sex assigned at birth–is overlooked globally. This mixed-methods exploratory study sought to understand the lived experiences, health, and social needs of trans men in Lima, Peru to bring visibility to specific health needs and inform responsive and holistic public health efforts. Methods Between July 2016-January 2017, 46 trans men in Lima, Peru participated in a mixed-methods study. Four focus group discussions were conducted, complemented with 10 one-on-one interviews to explore in-depth issues that arose in groups. Two individuals participated in both a focus group and an interview. All participants completed a brief survey assessing sociodemographic characteristics and experiences with healthcare, mental health, and stigma. Audio files were transcribed verbatim and analyzed using an immersion crystallization approach to identify themes. Results Participants had a mean age of 24 years (range 18–48). Trans men reported a lack of awareness and information among medical providers, avoidance of healthcare due to discrimination and maltreatment, an absence of public services for medical gender affirmation (hormones, surgeries), and unmet mental health needs. Trans men described health as multidimensional and influenced by social, economic, and legal contexts including family, school, employment and work, legal identity recognition, discrimination in public spaces, and peer support. Violence, stigma, and intersecting forms of oppression were described as limiting social and legal recognition of trans identity a central dimension of health. Peer support, often in an online environment, was described as important to resistance and well-being. Conclusions Findings demonstrate that the physical and mental health of trans men, as well as unmet needs for healthcare services, are influenced by a complex set of social, economic, and legal challenges due to the social exclusion of trans people in Peruvian society. Results are a call to action for stakeholders in Peru to guarantee the rights, health, and wellbeing of this community."
https://openalex.org/W3190875590,"Extracting shared structure across our experiences allows us to generalize our knowledge to novel contexts. How do different brain states influence this ability to generalize? Using a novel category learning paradigm, we assess the effect of both sleep and time of day on generalization that depends on the flexible integration of recent information. Counter to our expectations, we found no evidence that this form of generalization is better after a night of sleep relative to a day awake. Instead, we observed an effect of time of day, with better generalization in the morning than the evening. This effect also manifested as increased false memory for generalized information. In a nap experiment, we found that generalization did not benefit from having slept recently, suggesting a role for time of day apart from sleep. In follow-up experiments, we were unable to replicate the time of day effect for reasons that may relate to changes in category structure and task engagement. Despite this lack of consistency, we found a morning benefit for generalization when analyzing all the data from experiments with matched protocols (n = 136). We suggest that a state of lowered inhibition in the morning may facilitate spreading activation between otherwise separate memories, promoting this form of generalization."
https://openalex.org/W3192369490,"Expression of β-crystallin B2 (CRYβB2) is elevated in African American (AA) breast tumors. The underlying mechanisms of CRYβB2-induced malignancy and the association of CRYβB2 protein expression with survival have not yet been described. Here, we report that the expression of CRYβB2 in breast cancer cells increases stemness, growth, and metastasis. Transcriptomics data revealed that CRYβB2 upregulates genes that are functionally associated with unfolded protein response, oxidative phosphorylation, and DNA repair, while down-regulating genes related to apoptosis. CRYβB2 in tumors promotes de-differentiation, an increase in mesenchymal markers and cancer-associated fibroblasts, and enlargement of nucleoli. Proteome microarrays identified a direct interaction between CRYβB2 and the nucleolar protein, nucleolin. CRYβB2 induces nucleolin, leading to the activation of AKT and EGFR signaling. CRISPR studies revealed a dependency on nucleolin for the pro-tumorigenic effects of CRYβB2. Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) xenografts with upregulated CRYβB2 are distinctively sensitive to the nucleolin aptamer, AS-1411. Lastly, in AA patients, higher levels of nucleolar CRYβB2 in primary TNBC correlates with decreased survival. In summary, CRYβB2 is upregulated in breast tumors of AA patients and induces oncogenic alterations consistent with an aggressive cancer phenotype. CRYβB2 increases sensitivity to nucleolin inhibitors and may promote breast cancer disparity."
https://openalex.org/W3187683696,"Synaptic plasticity is critical for brain function, including learning and memory. It is regulated by gene transcription and protein synthesis as well as posttranslational modifications at synapses. Although protein acetylation has been shown to be involved in the regulation of synaptic plasticity, this was mainly for histone protein acetylation. To investigate whether acetylation of nonhistone proteins is important for synaptic plasticity, we analyzed mouse brain acetylome and found that calmodulin (CaM), a ubiquitous Ca2+ sensor, was acetylated on three lysine residues, which were conserved across species. NMDA receptor-dependent long-term potentiation (LTP) is considered the most compelling form of synaptic plasticity. During LTP induction, activation of NMDA receptor triggers Ca2+ influx, and the Ca2+ binds with CaM and activates calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase IIα (CaMKIIα), which is essential for LTP induction. By using home-generated and site-specific antibodies against acetylated CaM, we show that CaM acetylation is upregulated by neural activities in an NMDA receptor-dependent manner. Moreover, mutation of acetyllysines in CaM1 proteins disrupts synaptic plasticity and fear learning in a mouse model. We further demonstrate that acetylation of CaM reduces the binding free energy and increases the binding affinity toward CaMKIIα, a protein kinase pivotal to synaptic plasticity and learning. Taken together, our results demonstrate importance of CaM acetylation in regulating synaptic plasticity and learning."
https://openalex.org/W3189611059,"China is the key player in the globalization era and is eliminating its intra-national trade barrier. This process will affect interprovincial CO 2 flows. This study recalculates interprovincial CO 2 flows in China by using the latest MRIO table and applies a gravity model to assess how market segmentation affects interprovincial CO 2 flows. Results show that the total volume of interprovincial embodied CO 2 flow did not increase excessively from 2007 to 2012, but the pattern of embodied CO 2 flow had changed a lot. Market segmentation significantly decreased the interprovincial embodied CO 2 flows in China and within its sub-regions. At interregional level, market segmentation’s negative effect was significant between Central and Western China. Other variables such as geographical distance showed a significant negative impact on interprovincial embodied CO 2 flow in China. On the basis of our results, we raise some relevant policies to deal with the environmental inequality caused by the decrease in market segmentation."
https://openalex.org/W3191497317,"Since the outbreak of the global COVID-19 pandemic, social distancing has been known to everyone and recommended almost everywhere everyday. Social distancing has been and will be one of the most effective measures and sometimes, the only available one for fighting epidemics and saving lives. However, it has not been so clear how social distancing should be practiced or managed, especially when it comes to regulating everyone’s otherwise normal social activities. The debate on how to implement social distancing often leads to a heated political argument, while research on the subject is lacking. This paper is to provide a theoretical basis for the understanding of the scientific nature of social distancing by considering it as a social dilemma game played by every individual against his/her population. From this perspective, every individual needs to make a decision on how to engage in social distancing, or risk being trapped into a dilemma either exposing to deadly diseases or getting no access to necessary social activities. As the players of the game, the individual’s decisions depend on the population’s actions and vice versa, and an optimal strategy can be found when the game reaches an equilibrium. The paper shows how an optimal strategy can be determined for a population with either closely related or completely separated social activities and with either single or multiple social groups, and how the collective behaviors of social distancing can be simulated by following every individual’s actions as the distancing game progresses. The simulation results for populations of varying sizes and complexities are presented, which not only justify the choices of the strategies based on the theoretical analysis, but also demonstrate the convergence of the individual actions to an optimal distancing strategy in silico and possibly in natura as well, if every individual makes rational distancing decisions."
https://openalex.org/W3191663628,"Understanding the mechanism by which cellulases from bacteria, fungi, and protozoans catalyze the digestion of lignocellulose is important for developing cost-effective strategies for bioethanol production. Cel7A from the fungus Trichoderma reesei is a model exoglucanase that degrades cellulose strands from their reducing ends by processively cleaving individual cellobiose units. Despite being one of the most studied cellulases, the binding and hydrolysis mechanisms of Cel7A are still debated. Here, we used single-molecule tracking to analyze the dynamics of 11,116 quantum dot-labeled TrCel7A molecules binding to and moving processively along immobilized cellulose. Individual enzyme molecules were localized with a spatial precision of a few nanometers and followed for hundreds of seconds. Most enzyme molecules bound to cellulose in a static state and dissociated without detectable movement, whereas a minority of molecules moved processively for an average distance of 39 nm at an average speed of 3.2 nm/s. These data were integrated into a three-state model in which TrCel7A molecules can bind from solution into either static or processive states and can reversibly switch between states before dissociating. From these results, we conclude that the rate-limiting step for cellulose degradation by Cel7A is the transition out of the static state, either by dissociation from the cellulose surface or by initiation of a processive run. Thus, accelerating the transition of Cel7A out of its static state is a potential avenue for improving cellulase efficiency."
https://openalex.org/W3192044295,"Oxidative stress has been implicated in the pathogenesis and progression of several tauopathies, including Alzheimer's disease. The deposition of fibrillar inclusions made of tau protein is one of the pathological hallmarks of these disorders. Although it is becoming increasingly evident that the specific fibril structure may vary from one tauopathy to another and it is recognized that different types of isoforms (three-repeat and four-repeat tau) can be selectively deposited, little is known about the role oxidation may play in aggregation. Four-repeat tau contains two cysteines that can form an intramolecular disulfide bond, resulting in a structurally restrained compact monomer. There is discrepancy as to whether this monomer can aggregate or not. Using isolated four-repeat tau monomers (htau40) with intramolecular disulfide bonds, we demonstrate that these proteins form fibrils. The fibrils are less stable than fibrils formed under reducing conditions but are highly effective in seeding oxidized tau monomers. Conversely, a strong seeding barrier prevents incorporation of reduced tau monomers, tau mimics in which the cysteines have been replaced by alanines or serines, and three-repeat tau (htau23), a single-cysteine isoform. The barrier also holds true when seed and monomer types are reversed, indicating that oxidized and reduced tau are incompatible with each other. Surprisingly, fibrils composed of compact tau disaggregate upon reduction, highlighting the importance of the intramolecular disulfide bond for fibril stability. The findings uncover a novel binary redox switch that controls the aggregation and disaggregation of these fibrils and extend the conformational spectrum of tau aggregates."
https://openalex.org/W3192795759,"Foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) is endemic in Kenya affecting cloven-hoofed ruminants. The epidemiology of the disease in small ruminants (SR) in Kenya is not documented. We carried out a cross-sectional study, the first in Kenya, to estimate the sero-prevalence of FMD in SR and the associated risk factors nationally. Selection of animals to be sampled used a multistage cluster sampling approach. Serum samples totaling 7564 were screened for FMD antibodies of non-structural-proteins using ID Screen ® NSP Competition ELISA kit. To identify the risk factors, generalized linear mixed effects (GLMM) logistic regression analysis with county and villages as random effect variables was used. The country animal level sero-prevalence was 22.5% (95% CI: 22.3%-24.3%) while herd level sero-prevalence was 77.6% (95% CI: 73.9%-80.9%). The risk factor that was significantly positively associated with FMD sero-positivity in SR was multipurpose production type (OR = 1.307; p = 0.042). The risk factors that were significantly negatively associated with FMD sero-positivity were male sex (OR = 0.796; p = 0.007), young age (OR = 0.470; p = 0.010), and sedentary production zone (OR = 0.324; p&lt;0.001). There were no statistically significant intra class correlations among the random effect variables but interactions between age and sex variables among the studied animals were statistically significant (p = 0.019). This study showed that there may be widespread undetected virus circulation in SR indicated by the near ubiquitous spatial distribution of significant FMD sero-positivity in the country. Strengthening of risk-based FMD surveillance in small ruminants is recommended. Adjustment of husbandry practices to control FMD in SR and in-contact species is suggested. Cross-transmission of FMD and more risk factors need to be researched."
https://openalex.org/W3107484081,"Postoperative delirium (POD) and subsyndromal delirium (SSD) among older patients is a common, serious condition associated with a high incidence of negative outcomes. However, there are few accurate methods for the early detection of POD and SSD in surgical wards. This study aimed to identify risk factors of POD and SSD in older patients who were scheduled for surgery in a surgical ward. This was a prospective observational study. Study participants were older than 65 years, underwent urology surgery, and were hospitalized in the surgical ward between April and September 2019. Delirium symptoms were assessed using the Confusion Assessment Method (CAM) on the preoperative day, the day of surgery, and postoperative days 1–3 by the surgical ward nurses. SSD was defined as the presence of one or more CAM criteria and the absence of a diagnosis of delirium based on the CAM algorithm. Personal characteristics, clinical data, cognitive function, physical functions, laboratory test results, medication use, type of surgery and anesthesia, and use of physical restraint and bed sensor were collected from medical records. Multiple logistic regression analyses were conducted to identify the risk factors for both POD and SSD. A total of 101 participants (mean age 74.9 years) were enrolled; 19 (18.8%) developed POD (n = 4) and SSD (n = 15). The use of bed sensors (odds ratio 10.2, p = .001) was identified as a risk factor for both POD and SSD. Our findings suggest that the use of bed sensors might be related to the development of both POD and SSD among older patients in surgical wards."
https://openalex.org/W3189356917,"In this study, a series of small-scale experiments were conducted to investigate the backdraft phenomenon in a compartment (1.1 × 0.4 × 0.75 m) with woodblocks as fuel. This research focused on the effects of compartment window woodblock areas on backdraft time, with a video recording of the experimental phenomena. Thermocouples and a gas analyzer were used to measure the temperature and the concentration of gas components in the compartment, respectively. There was no additional heat source or ignition source pre-set in the compartment at the beginning of the experiments; the experimental processes only depended on the heat released from the burning or smoldering of woodblocks. When compartment ventilation improved, smoldering of woodblocks became intense, and backdraft occurred. The results show that backdraft time is shorten with increases of compartment window and woodblock areas, and opening the upper window of a compartment could avoid the backdraft phenomenon. The results help to understand the backdraft phenomenon of solid fuel and, more importantly, could help firefighters adopt reasonable fire-fighting strategies for restraining backdraft occurrence."

In France, its epidemiology and management are understudied in ambulatory care. We described the clinical profile, pharmacological management, and clinical outcomes in a French sample of FH patients. Methods This was a retrospective longitudinal study on patients from The Health Improvement Network (THIN ® ) database in France, between October 2016-June 2019. Patients ≥18 years, with probable/definite FH based on the Dutch Lipid Clinic Network (DLCN) criteria were included. Baseline characteristics, lipid profile, lipid-lowering therapy (LLT), low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C) goal achievement; and disease management at 6-month of follow-up were analyzed. Results 116 patients with probable (n = 70)/definite (n = 46) FH were included (mean age:57.8±14.0 years; 56.0% women; 9.5% with personal history of cardiovascular events); 90 patients had data available at follow-up. At baseline, 77.6% of patients had LDL-C&gt;190 mg/dL, 27.6% were not receiving LLTs, 37.9% received statins alone, 20.7% statins with other LLTs, and 7.7% other LLTs. High-intensity statins were prescribed to 11.2% of patients, 30.2% received moderate-intensity statins, and 8.6% low-intensity statins. Only 6.0% of patients achieved LDL-C goal. At 6-month of follow-up, statins discontinuation and switching were 22.7% and 2.3%, respectively. None of the patients received proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) inhibitors at baseline nor follow-up. Conclusions Despite the existence of effective LLTs, FH patients are suboptimally-treated, do not achieve LDL-C goal, and exhibit worsened pharmacological management over time. Future studies with longer follow-up periods and assessment of factors affecting LDL-C management, including lifestyle and diet, are needed."

This deterioration is very complex in the river irrigation area and is caused by multi-point and non-point source pollution and seasonal variation. Therefore, the characteristics and sources of soil metal pollution in river irrigation area of Baoji city were analyzed. The contents of 8 metals were given by ICP-MS, in the soil samples. Statistical methods, geo-accumulation index ( I geo ) and potential ecological risk index ( RI ) were conducted to evaluate the spatial distribution features, sources and ecological risks of metal contamination from the study area soil. Principal component analysis and cluster analysis were used to analyze the pollution sources of metal. The analysis showed that Cd is the most polluted, and human activities represented a great impact on the contents of Zn, Ni, Cu and Cd in soil, Cd post moderate-strong pollution and strong risk, Cd has a maximum Igeo value of 3.17. All rivers were at risk of moderate pollution levels in study . Among them, some rivers had even reached strong pollution level. Pollution caused by human activities was the most significant pollution source of metal in the research area soil."
https://openalex.org/W3191734778,"Background Cardiorespiratory fitness is often impaired following stroke, and peak oxygen consumption (VO 2peak ) is an important prognostic value of all-cause mortality. The primary objective was to investigate whether functional walk tests assessed in the subacute phase after stroke added value in predicting VO 2peak in chronic stroke, in addition to age, sex and functional dependency. Secondary objectives were to investigate associations between daily physical activity and functional walk tests, and with VO 2peak in chronic stroke. Methods This prospective cohort study included eligible participants originally included in the randomized controlled trial Life After Stroke. Functional walk tests, i.e., six-minute walk test (6MWT) and maximal gait speed, were assessed at inclusion and 18 months later. VO 2peak [ml/kg/min] was assessed by a cardiopulmonary exercise test on a treadmill 20 months after inclusion. Daily physical activity was measured by a uniaxial accelerometer (activPAL) at 18-month follow-up. Results Ninety-two community-dwelling individuals, with a mean (SD) age of 69.2 (10.6) years and 33 (35.9%) women, were included 3 months after stroke onset. Eighty-three (90.2%) participants had a modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score of 1 or 2, indicating functional independence. An overall assessment of four prediction models indicated the combination of age, sex, mRS and 6MWT as predictors to be the best fitted model in predicting VO 2peak (adjusted R 2 = 0.612). Secondary results showed statistically significant, but not clinically significant, associations between daily physical activity and functional walk tests, and with VO 2peak. Conclusions 6MWT add significant value to the prediction of mean VO 2peak in the chronic phase in mild strokes, in combination with age, sex and functional dependency. This prediction model may facilitate clinical decisions and rehabilitation strategies for mildly affected stroke survivors in risk of low levels of VO 2peak . Future studies should validate the model in various stages after stroke and in patients moderately and severely affected."
https://openalex.org/W3192287829,"Objective To evaluate whether the risk of subsequent psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis development is increased in patients with uveitis. Methods In Taiwan’s national health insurance research database, we identified 195,125 patients with new-onset uveitis between 2001 and 2013. We randomly selected 390,250 individuals without uveitis who were matched 2:1 to uveitis cases based on age, sex and year of enrolment. The characteristics of the two groups were compared. Using multivariate Cox regression, hazard ratios (HRs) for psoriasis or psoriatic arthritis corresponding to uveitis were computed after adjustment for age, sex, insurance cost and comorbidities. In subgroup analyses, separate HRs for mild psoriasis, severe psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis were calculated. Results The mean age of the study cohort was 50.2 ± 17.2 years. Hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidaemia and obesity were more prevalent in the uveitis group (all p &lt; 0.0001). The hazard of psoriasis or psoriatic arthritis development was significantly greater in the uveitis group than in the non-uveitis group ( p &lt; 0.0001); this increased risk persisted after adjustment for confounders [adjusted HR = 1.41; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.33–1.48]. Adjusted HRs showed an increasing trend from mild psoriasis (1.35; 95% CI, 1.28–1.44) to severe psoriasis (1.59; 95% CI, 1.30–1.94) and psoriatic arthritis (1.97; 95% CI, 1.60–2.42). Conclusions This nationwide population-based cohort study revealed that patients with uveitis have an increased risk of subsequent psoriasis or psoriatic arthritis development."
https://openalex.org/W3192898468,"Financial bubbles have always been a topic of long-term concern for economists. Understanding bubble phenomenon and dating the period of bubbles in real time can provide an early warning diagnosis for financial bubbles and help regulatory authorities to control it and maintain market order. The generalized sup ADF (GSADF) and backward sup ADF (BSADF) tests with flexible window width can effectively detect and date periodically collapsing bubbles in real time. Based on the financial present value model, this paper applies right-tail recursive ADF test to test multiple bubbles in China’s multi-level stock market. Unlike the other researches in China, the ratios of the real stock prices’ natural logarithm to the real dividends’ natural logarithm are used for our testing instead of stock price index. Empirical results show that there are 8 bubbles in the Main-Board Market, 6 bubbles in the Small and Medium Enterprises Board (SMEs), and 4 bubbles in the Growth Enterprise Market (GEM). These bubbles are liquidity-driven and presuppose a loose credit cycle, with the exception of bubbles in 2014–2015. The frequent emergence of bubbles in a short time indicates that China’s stock market is still emerging market. In addition, frequent fluctuations imply there is a serious “herd effect” and a lack of monitoring mechanism for bubble risk. This study not only enrich the real-time dynamic research on periodical bubbles of China’s stock market, but also provide an empirical reference for investors’ investment choices, financial decisions of listed companies and warning mechanism of regulatory authorities."
https://openalex.org/W3191977805,"With the development of urbanisation and the increasing number of modern vehicles, traffic contamination has become an important source of environmental pollution. Most previous studies have focused on using roadside soil or plants to determine the spatial pattern of traffic pollutants along roads and the factors that influence this pattern, whereas few studies have reconstructed pollution histories caused by traffic using suitable methods. In this study, two gravity cores were obtained from Qianhu Lake, which is in the Zhongshan tourist area of Nanjing City and is distant from industrial areas. An accurate chronological framework covering the period from 1994 to 2014 was established using the correlation between the variation in grain size of the sediment cores and the variation in annual rainfall in Nanjing City. Moreover, magnetic and chemical parameters were also measured, and the results demonstrated that concentration-related magnetic parameters exhibited different correlations with different heavy metal concentrations. These correlations were significantly positive for Zn , Pb , and Co ; weakly positive for Ni; absent for Cr; and negative for V. Combined with statistical data on industrial emissions and private cars in Nanjing City since 1994, the observed variations in magnetic susceptibility, anhysteretic remanent magnetisation, saturation isothermal remanent magnetisation, Zn , Pb , and Co , were controlled by traffic activities in the tourist area but not by industry. Therefore, the variations in these parameters record the traffic pollution history of the study area. Combined with the obtained chronological framework, the traffic-related pollution history could be divided into two stages: 1) from 1994 to 2003, when traffic-related pollution became increasingly serious because of the exponential increase in the number of private cars and the prosperity of tourism; 2) from 2003 to 2014, when traffic-related pollution continuously increased but at a much slower rate than in stage 1. This slower rate of increase was probably related to the maximum carrying capacity of the tourist area and technological innovations in automobile manufacturing, as well as improvements in fuels."
https://openalex.org/W3192948021,"The Q80K polymorphism in the NS3-4A protease of the hepatitis C virus is associated with treatment failure of direct-acting antiviral agents. This polymorphism is highly prevalent in genotype 1a infections and stably transmitted between hosts. Here, we investigated the underlying molecular mechanisms of evolutionarily conserved coevolving amino acids in NS3-Q80K and revealed potential implications of epistatic interactions in immune escape and variants persistence. Using purified protein, we characterized the impact of epistatic amino acid substitutions on the physicochemical properties and peptide cleavage kinetics of the NS3-Q80K protease. We found that Q80K destabilized the protease protein fold (p < 0.0001). Although NS3-Q80K showed reduced peptide substrate turnover (p < 0.0002), replicative fitness in an H77S.3 cell culture model of infection was not significantly inferior to the WT virus. Epistatic substitutions at residues 91 and 174 in NS3-Q80K stabilized the protein fold (p < 0.0001) and leveraged the WT protease stability. However, changes in protease stability inversely correlated with enzymatic activity. In infectious cell culture, these secondary substitutions were not associated with a gain of replicative fitness in NS3-Q80K variants. Using molecular dynamics, we observed that the total number of residue contacts in NS3-Q80K mutants correlated with protein folding stability. Changes in the number of contacts reflected the compensatory effect on protein folding instability by epistatic substitutions. In summary, epistatic substitutions in NS3-Q80K contribute to viral fitness by mechanisms not directly related to RNA replication. By compensating for protein-folding instability, epistatic interactions likely protect NS3-Q80K variants from immune cell recognition."
https://openalex.org/W3190534807,"Background The potential association between level of education and age-related cognitive decline remains an open question, partly because of a lack of studies including large subsamples with low education and follow-up intervals covering a substantial part of the adult lifespan. Objectives To examine cognitive decline assessed by a comprehensive clinical test of intelligence over a 35-year period of follow-up from ages 50 to 85 and to analyze the effect of education on trajectories of cognitive decline, including the effects of selective attrition. Methods A longitudinal cohort study with a 35-year follow-up of community dwelling members of the Glostrup 1914 cohort. The study sample comprised 697 men and women at the 50-year baseline assessment and additional participants recruited at later follow-ups. Verbal, Performance, and Full Scale IQs were assessed using the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale at ages 50, 60, 70, 80, and 85. To be able to track cognitive changes between successive WAIS assessments, all IQs were based on the Danish 50-year norms. Information on school education was self-reported. The association between education and cognitive decline over time was examined in growth curve models. Selective attrition was investigated in subsamples of participants who dropped out at early or later follow-ups. Results The trajectories for Verbal, Performance, and Full Scale IQ showed higher initial cognitive performance, but also revealed steeper decline among participants with a formal school exam compared to participants without a formal exam. Verbal IQ showed the largest difference in level between the two educational groups, whereas the interaction between education and age was stronger for Performance IQ than for Verbal IQ. In spite of the difference in trajectories, higher mean IQ was observed among participants with a formal school exam compared to those without across all ages, including the 85-year follow-up. Further analyses revealed that early dropout was associated with steeper decline, but that this effect was unrelated to education. Conclusion Comprehensive cognitive assessment over a 35-year period suggests that higher education is associated with steeper decline in IQ, but also higher mean IQ at all follow-ups. These findings are unlikely to reflect regression towards the mean, other characteristics of the employed test battery or associations between educational level and study dropout."

Material and methods The local ethics board gave its approval for retrospective data analysis. Automated liver volume quantification in 300 consecutive livers in 164 male and 103 female oncologic patients (64±12y) performed at our institution (between January 2020 and May 2020) using two different dual-energy helicals: portal-venous phase enhanced, ref. tube current 300mAs (CARE Dose4D) for tube A (100 kV) and ref. 232mAs tube current for tube B (Sn140kV), slice collimation 0.6mm, reconstruction kernel I30f/1, recon. thickness of 0.6mm and 5mm, 80–100 mL iodine contrast agent 350 mg/mL, (flow 2mL/s) and unenhanced ref. tube current 100mAs (CARE Dose4D) for tube A (100 kV) and ref. 77mAs tube current for tube B (Sn140kV), slice collimation 0.6mm (kernel Q40f) were analyzed. The post-processing tool ( syngo .CT Liver Analysis) is already FDA-approved. Two resident radiologists with no and 1-year CT-experience performed both the automated measurements independently from each other. Results were compared with those of manual liver volume quantification using the same software which was supervised by a senior radiologist with 30-year CT-experience (ground truth). Results In total, a correlation of 98% was obtained for liver volumetry based on enhanced and unenhanced data sets compared to the manual liver quantification. Radiologist #1 and #2 achieved an inter-reader agreement of 99.8% for manual liver segmentation (p&lt;0.0001). Automated liver volumetry resulted in an overestimation (&gt;5% deviation) of 3.7% for unenhanced CT-image data and 4.0% for contrast-enhanced CT-images. Underestimation (&lt;5%) of liver volume was 2.0% for unenhanced CT-image data and 1.3% for enhanced images after automated liver volumetry. Number and distribution of erroneous volume measurements using either thin or thick slice reconstructions was exactly the same, both for the enhanced as well for the unenhanced image data sets (p&gt; 0.05). Conclusion Results of fully automated liver volume quantification are accurate and comparable with those of manual liver volume quantification and the technique seems to be confident even if unenhanced lower-dose CT image data is used."
https://openalex.org/W3192958752,"Normalisation process theory reports the importance of contextual integration in successfully embedding novel interventions, with recent propositions detailing the role that 'plasticity' of intervention components and 'elasticity' of an intended setting contribute. We report on the introduction of a clinical pathway assessing patient non-responsiveness to treatment for glaucoma and ocular hypertension. The aim of this study was to assess the feasibility of implementing the Cardiff Model of Glaucoma Care into hospital eye services, identifying any issues of acceptability for staff through the filter of normalisation process theory.A prospective observational study was undertaken in four hospital eye services. This incorporated detailed qualitative semi-structured interviews with staff (n = 8) to gather their perceptions on the intervention's usefulness and practicality. In addition, observational field notes of patient and staff consultations (n = 88) were collected, as well as broader organisational observations from within the research sites (n = 52). Data collection and analysis was informed by the normalisation process theory framework.Staff reported the pathway led to beneficial knowledge on managing patient treatment, but the model was sometimes perceived as overly prescriptive. This perception varied significantly based on the composition of clinics in relation to staff experience, staff availability and pre-existing clinical structures. The most commonly recounted barrier came in contextually integrating into sites where wider administrative systems were inflexible to intervention components.Flexibility will be the key determinant of whether the clinical pathway can progress to wider implementation. Addressing the complexity and variation associated with practice between clinics required a remodelling of the pathway to maintain its central benefits but enhance its plasticity. Our study therefore helps to confirm propositions developed in relation to normalisation process theory, contextual integration, intervention plasticity, and setting elasticity. This enables the transferability of findings to healthcare settings other than ophthalmology, where any novel intervention is implemented."
